<HEAD><HI>Speech of Mr. Charles Pinckney,</HI> Late Governor of South Carolina, at a very numerous Meeting of the Citizens of Charle&s;ton, the 22d July, <HI>1795,</HI> to hear the Report of their Committee on the Treaty between Great-Britain and the United States of America. Carefully collected from the Notes of Mr. Pinckney, and afterwards in&s;pected by him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>HE began by &s;aying, that having been ab&s;ent in the coun|try, he was prevented from attending their meeting on the 16th&mdash;but, conceiving it the duty of every friend to his country, on an occa&s;ion &s;o intere&s;ting to their commercial rights, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tate &s;ome ob&s;ervations in &s;upport of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n he &s;hould give on the treaty.</P>
<P>In doing this, he &s;aid he &s;hould follow the advice that had ju&s;t been properly given by the Intendant, and be very mo|derate. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of &s;uch importance, moderation appear|ed to him e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P>It was &s;omewhere very well &s;aid, that pa&s;&s;ion and intempe|rance never failed to wre&s;t the &s;ceptre from rea&s;on; and he hoped they would not, on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, prevent the fair application of argument to the judgment of an a&s;&s;embly &s;o numerous and re&s;pectable as that was.</P>
<P>In examining the treaty, it appeared to him nece&s;&s;ary pre|viou&s;ly to trace the manner in which Mr. Jay, had been ap|pointed to this tru&s;t, and the in&s;tructions he had received; in order to determine how far it was conducted, in its com|mencement and progre&s;s, upon tho&s;e principles which were conformable to the &s;pirit and intention of that article of the con&s;titution which re&s;pects treaties, and to the candor and fairne&s;s which ought to govern in all negociations where any thing like reciprocity is to be expected, and where there was no determination, on the part of the government, or its ne|gociator, that unnece&s;&s;ary and di&s;honorable &s;acrifices were to be nature.</P>
<P>He &s;aid that it mu&s;t here be acknowledged, that as Mr. Jay's appointment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> originated in a bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, if not of the letter, yet mo&s;t clearly of the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution&mdash;which &s;eems, to have intended, that a judicia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hould be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected in a manner that would re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> independent of the in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ence of
<PB N="6" REF="028389_0005_0FD8E6AC5597D8E8">the executive and legi&s;lature, or of tho&s;e prejudices which the mo&s;t di&s;tant connection with either mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pro|duce; and that the &s;ame man &s;hould not have it in his power to form a treaty, and afterwards, as a judge, preju|diced as he mu&s;t be by being concerned in its negociation, to decide upon its meaning: &s;o there had appeared, for a con&s;i|derable time, a determination in a party in our government to force a connection with Great Britain, not only at the ri&s;k of this valuable guard to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by e&s;|tabli&s;hing a precedent for taking the judges from the bench, <HI>while in office,</HI> and giving them diplomatic or other appoint|ments, but in a breach of a &s;till more important limitation of the con&s;titution&mdash;the one which re&s;pects the power of the pre&s;ident to form treaties with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>By referring to the proceedings of the &s;enate on this oc|ca&s;ion, it appears that the pre&s;ident, in a &s;hort, unexplanatory me&s;&s;age, &s;tated to them, that, from the communications of our mini&s;ter in Great Britain, our affairs with that court wore a &s;erious a&s;pect; that before we re&s;orted to the la&s;t expedient, which had been the &s;courge of &s;o many nations, he thought negociation preferable, and nominated Mr. Jay as envoy ex|traordinary on that occa&s;ion. He &s;aid, his confidence in our mini&s;ter re&s;ident there remained undimini&s;hed; but he &s;till was of opinion, the mea&s;ure was nece&s;&s;ary; that &s;uch an en|voy, going from among us at this time, would have fuller information of the &s;tate of things, and carry with him more ef|fectually the &s;en&s;ibility and feelings of the people.</P>
<P>On this me&s;&s;age being &s;ent to the &s;enate, it was very pro|perly &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome of the members of that body, that the pre&s;ident ought to have &s;ubmitted to them the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s upon which Mr. Jay was to have been &s;ent; and a motion to that effect was brought forward, but negatived. Mr. Jay's appointment was con&s;ented to; and, as far as he under&s;tood to be the fact, he was ab&s;olutely &s;ent to negociate a treaty with Great Britain, without his in&s;tructions being &s;ubmitted to the &s;enate, or that body being acquainted with the pre&s;ident's intention to enter into a negociation, which was ultimately to lead to the formation of a treaty of &s;uch immen&s;e con&s;equence to every part of the union. He had been inform|ed, and he believed his information was correct, that many of the members of the &s;enate at that time were of opinion, Mr. Jay was &s;ent for the purpo&s;e of obtaining compen&s;ation for the depre|dations in the We&s;t Indies; to demand the delivery of the po&s;ts, and the execution of the treaty of peace; and to require a &s;tipu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion,
<PB N="7" REF="028389_0006_0FD8E6AF441F9678">that our ve&s;&s;els &s;hould not in future be liable to &s;eizure or condemnation on any pretence. He was &s;ure that this was the general opinion of the people in this part of the union; and, as he had ob&s;erved, he under&s;tood it to be the opinion of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>If this is the fact, that Mr. Jay's in&s;tructions for forming this treaty were not &s;ubmitted to the &s;enate, nor received their a&s;&s;ent, he con&s;idered it as a matter of great importance indeed, and that required the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of the people, how far the con&s;titution ever intended to authorize the pre&s;ident to enter into any negociation with a foreign power, without his having fir&s;t &s;ubmitted his intentions and in&s;tructions to the &s;enate and received their advice and a&s;&s;ent, as well with re&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch negociation, as to the propriety of his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Mr. Pinckney &s;aid, his opinion clearly was, that the con&s;ti|tution gave no power to the pre&s;ident to commence a negocia|tion, without previou&s;ly &s;ubmitting his intentions and in&s;truc|tions to the &s;enate, requiring their advice and receiving their a&s;&s;ent. The words "by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate" admit no other explanation. He cannot be &s;aid to advi&s;e with them upon a mea&s;ure, if he forms a treaty without their knowledge, and merely leaves to them the power of de|termining whether they will ratify it or not, after it has been &s;olemnly concluded by the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The true con&s;truction of this article, and the u&s;e the people of the union will one day require to be made of it, is, if the pre&s;ident thought a foreign negociation nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould previou&s;ly con&s;ult the &s;enate, and be governed by their opinion, how far it would be proper, and upon what conditi|ons, to proceed in it; and that if the &s;enate, without the previ|ous interference of the pre&s;ident, thought a negociation proper, that they &s;hould advi&s;e it, and that the pre&s;ident &s;hould enter upon it. Although a contrary u&s;e had hitherto been made of this power, yet Mr. Pinckney &s;aid, that it well de&s;erved the attention of the public, whether any other con&s;truction ought to be admitted; and that if a different u&s;e had been made of it, or if the article was doubtful, or open to any other mean|ing, whether it was not of greater con&s;equence than any thing that had been agitated &s;ince the revolution, that the&s;e doubts &s;hould be removed, and the meaning he contended for, une|quivocally given to the article. If, on the other hand, a power was to be given to the pre&s;ident to enter into negociations with foreigners, without acquainting the &s;enate with their nature, or the connections he wi&s;hes to form, and be &s;hould merely
<PB N="8" REF="028389_0007_0FD8E6B15B8CB430">leave to them the power of ratifying or not, it mu&s;t at once be &s;een, that the agency, which the con&s;titution intended to give the &s;enate, in the formation of treaties, was in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed; and that as it was an unu&s;ual, and &s;ome|times a hazardous thing, and productive of war, or other na|tional calamities, for nations to refu&s;e to ratify a treaty after it had been &s;igned by the mini&s;ter, who, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, was properly in&s;tructed, and acted agreeably to the in&s;tructions and wi&s;hes of tho&s;e who &s;ent him, there could be no doubt of im|proper treaties being FORCED upon the people.</P>
<P>If the &s;enate were not to have a right to advi&s;e the pre&s;ident to a negociation, which they con&s;idered as proper, without his previous interference&mdash;if no foreign connection was to take place but of his propo&s;ing&mdash;it then indeed became an enquiry of the highe&s;t importance, how far the people or the con&s;titu|tion of the United States ever intended to place all its foreign connections, all the treaties they may think nece&s;&s;ary to their peace and &s;ecurity, to their general intere&s;ts, or the regulation of their commerce, in the hands of one man: a man in whom, by giving him the right to nominate, they had already placed all the honors and offices of the government; and to which unexampled power in any thing that had even the appearance of a free government, an attempt, was here made to add the all-important one of concluding treaties without the knowledge of the &s;enate, and leaving it to them merely to ratify: a power which, under an unwi&s;e u&s;e of it, may involve us in wars, abridge our rights, and would, as he &s;hould attempt to &s;hew, by &s;uch treaties as Mr. Jay's, eventually de&s;troy our navingation and commerce, and the right congre&s;s had to regulate them.</P>
<P>He would, upon a proper occa&s;ion, enter more largely into the&s;e &s;ubjects; he had at pre&s;ent mentioned them with a view to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of the people's &s;eriou&s;ly attending to a treaty, in the commencement of which there have been two breaches of the con&s;titution, and which, from the manner of its negociation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bring before the public a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the important &s;ubjects which on this occa&s;ion he had only time very &s;lightly to touch upon.</P>
<P>If, however, a treaty was con&s;idered as indi&s;pen&s;ible, and our trade was in &s;o languid a &s;tate that it could not be advan|tageou&s;ly carried on without the &s;upport of, or a connection with Great Britain, &s;urely Mr. Jay was of all men the mo&s;t improper that could have been appointed; the mo&s;t unlikely to obtain tho&s;e advantages which the humbled and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;itua|tion of that country gave us a right to expect,&mdash;nay, to demand; and without which it is the univer&s;al opinion of all the real
<PB N="9" REF="028389_0008_0FD8E6B558C01EE0">friends of their country, it was di&s;honorable, not to &s;ay trea|cherous, to have entered into any treaty with them.&mdash;His di&s;|like to the French&mdash;his partiality for Briti&s;h government and mea&s;ure&mdash;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> opin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns as &s;ecretary, and afterwards as judge, in favor of their claims, were well known. On the&s;e points the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter was &s;ure of his acquie&s;cence in every de|mand. If he had attempted to &s;ay a word in favor of the claims, or even of allowances to his countrymen, his opponent had only to &s;how him his own opinions, and his lips mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>They could not but recollect his conduct, in the attempt be made in 1785, to barter away the rights of his country, in &s;acrificing the intere&s;ts, and of cour&s;e di&s;&s;evering the we&s;tern territory from the union, by ceding to Spain, for twenty-five years, the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, for which we were to receive a treaty that would not give a &s;ingle benefit we did not before po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which it mu&s;t always be her intere&s;t to allow. Standing, therefore, in this &s;ituation as a public man, he was &s;o devoted to the intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h, and his opi|nions in favor of that country were &s;o well known, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us, through &s;uch a negociator, to form any but a treaty de&s;tructive to our commercial rights, ungrateful and injurious to our allies, and con&s;equently degrading to our na|tional character. However, good may &s;ometimes ari&s;e our of evil. If he had not made this public expo&s;ure of his conduct and principles, he might one day have been brought forward, among others, as a candidate for our highe&s;t office.&mdash;But the general and de&s;erved contempt which his negociations have brought both his talents and principles into, will, he tru&s;ted, for ever &s;ecure his fellow citizens from the dangerous and un|wi&s;e u&s;e which &s;uch a man would have made of the important powers ve&s;ted in a pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>How far, under the&s;e circum&s;cances, and many of them mu&s;t have been known to him, it may have been prudent in the pre&s;ident to &s;end a man who has &s;hown him&s;elf &s;o unin|formed of the commercial intere&s;ts of his country, and &s;o mi|&s;erably deficient in tho&s;e talents which a negociator required&mdash; to oppo&s;e him &s;ingly, and at their own court, to the talents, experience, and perhaps temptations of their able&s;t &s;tate&s;men,&mdash; is one of tho&s;e extraordinary occurrences in his conduct, which, con&s;idering the character, general good &s;en&s;e, and un&s;haken integrity of the pre&s;ident, is difficult to be accounted for.</P>
<P>Such was the negociator; and &s;uch were the circum&s;tances under which this treaty has been produced.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028389_0009_0FD8E6B692F2C4E0">
I am now, he &s;aid, to examine the treaty,&mdash;but as the report of the committee has ju&s;t been read, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary, and occupy more of your time than you could &s;pare, to enter into a particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every article; all that can be expected, at pre&s;ent, is to review its leading features, and &s;tate how far they mi&s;&s;tate again&s;t the true intere&s;ts of our com|merce.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article admits the return of all per&s;ons to this coun|try, who&s;e conduct has rendered them obnoxious, and who&s;e ca&s;es have already been decided upon by the &s;tate legi&s;latures: a mea&s;ure repugnant to the feelings of our fellow citizens, and unnece&s;&s;ary in a treaty of commerce.</P>
<P>The &s;econd re&s;pects the po&s;ts. It is well known they are of con&s;equence to the intere&s;ts of the &s;tates concerned in the fur trade, and e&s;&s;ential to the peace and &s;ecurity of the inhabitants bordering on the Indians in that neighbourhood. Although the treaty of peace expre&s;sly &s;tipulated for their delivery twelve years ago, yet they have been retained, and &s;till are held in de|fiance of the authority and remon&s;trances of our government and, notwith&s;tanding they ought to have been delivered at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time fixed by the treaty, they are now offered to be granted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a douceur for &s;urrendering important privileges, and under ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+cum&s;tances which either give peculiar privileges to the Briti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ubjects, or give a right of citizen&s;hip to tho&s;e who have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and may again become, from their neighbourhood to the Indi|ans, dangerous enemies to the peace and trade of that part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the union.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;een, from the care which the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ni&s;ter has taken to word the 3d article, and the ea&s;y and ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+dy conce&s;&s;ion which Mr. Jay has made to the Briti&s;h of eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> privilege they could think of in&s;erting, that he has very nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> yielded to them almo&s;t every advantage that could flow to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from a trade with the Indians and the we&s;tern territory.</P>
<P>The article which re&s;pects the recovery of debts, is at ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as unnece&s;&s;ary as di&s;honorably burden&s;ome to our governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> It was a point upon which the creditors had long &s;ince m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> up their minds, and one which a very little firmne&s;s on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tituents, would have induced them to relinqui&s;h; by far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> greater number of ca&s;es had been &s;ettled by &s;uit or compromi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and it &s;eems to be calculated merely for the purpo&s;e of opera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a dangerous and exten&s;ive door to claims on the trea&s;ury the union; claims which, long &s;ince, have been laid a&s;ide, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many of which, particularly that part which re&s;pects the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, have originated in the mo&s;t manife&s;t inju&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="11" REF="028389_0010_0FD8E6BB0D8BBA48">But on this &s;ubject Mr. Jay had pledged him&s;elf. Although he knew it would operate to the ruin almo&s;t entirely of that cla&s;s which have been the greate&s;t &s;ufferers by the revo|lution, be meant the former merchants of America, &s;uch has been his con&s;tant and unremitted attention to the &s;upport of the Briti&s;h claims, that, as &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, as judge, and now as envoy, he has uncea&s;ingly and with marked indu&s;try and per&s;everance upon all occa&s;ions &s;upported them, again&s;t the intere&s;ts of his fellow citizens, the feelings of hu|manity, and the honor and gratitude of his country. It al&s;o creates a mode of adjudication unu&s;ual and unknown to the laws of this country; and leaves it to be determined by chance, whether the majority of the commi&s;&s;ioners to be appointed may not be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and load our funds, at plea&s;ure, with a very heavy debt.</P>
<P>The next point re&s;pects the depredations on our commerce in the We&s;t Indies, and the compen&s;ation it propo&s;es. This was the &s;ubject which gave ri&s;e to Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion; for, he &s;aid, he believed that had no depredations exi&s;ted, no &s;uch ap|pointment would have been made.&mdash;How far he has &s;ucceeded in his attempt to obtain compen&s;ation, or whether the mode he has adopted, will prove effectual, time alone can di&s;cover; at pre&s;ent it appears to be very doubtful, and to depend entire|ly upon chance. Each party are to appoint two commi&s;&s;ion|ers, who&s;e opinions will be previou&s;ly well known, and who will carry with them into their adjudications all the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of tho&s;e who appoint them&mdash;it will then de|pend entirely upon the fifth, who is to be cho&s;en by lot, in who&s;e favor the deci&s;ion will be: whereas the&s;e depredations being notorious breaches of the law of nations, and in&s;ulting infringements of our neutrality, the demand &s;hould have been &s;pirited and po&s;itive, the remedy &s;peedy and complete; no al|ternative &s;hould have been offered; he &s;hould have required immediate &s;atisfaction; if they had refu&s;ed, he &s;hould have quitted their court, and left it to his country to have determin|ed what other mea&s;ures were nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue. But, in&s;tead of this, he has accepted a remote, expen&s;ive, and uncertain remedy; and, in return for their refu&s;al of ju&s;tice, in the mo&s;t conde&s;cending manner has &s;tipulated that all prizes brought in by our allies, and which are &s;aid to have been captured by privateers illegally equipped, or taken within our limits, &s;hall be paid for upon certain and fixed principles.</P>
<P>As to the 12th article, which the &s;enate have rejected, there appears but one &s;entiment throughout the union; there can be but one in the bea&s;t of every man of &s;erfs, &s;pirit or hone&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="028389_0011_0FD8E6BCCFA11940">in every part of the world; that it is an infamous and degrad|ing &s;urrender of the rights and character of this country, and a mean and ungenerous de&s;ertion of the intere&s;t of our friends, the French, to who&s;e &s;upplies, at lea&s;t in the articles they con&s;ider as of nece&s;&s;ity in their pre&s;ent noble and unexampled &s;truggle for freedom, we are bound by every tie of gratitude and honor to attend. To examine this article fully, &s;tate its inequalities, the re&s;trictions it impo&s;es, and the evils that mu&s;t ari&s;e from it, are not within the limits of the&s;e ob&s;ervations; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, from the general dete&s;tation in which it is hold by foreigners as well as citizens. That for the paltry al|lowance of being permitted to &s;end ve&s;&s;els of 70 tons to the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies, we are to give up the right to export We&s;t India produce, and even the cotton of American growth, to Europe, in our own ve&s;&s;els, is &s;uch a glaring and in&s;olent attempt to abridge our rights and gratify the wi&s;hes of the Briti&s;h nation in checking our commerce, that, in&s;tead of car|rying with him the feelings and &s;en&s;ibility of his countrymen, which were certainly &s;ufficiently awake to the conduct of Great Britain, he mu&s;t have entirely forgot their temper and firmne&s;s; he could not have remembered, that, however mild and obedient they generally were to laws founded in equality and a regard to their rights, yet that they loved their country, were attentive to its intere&s;ts, and impatient of any in&s;ult on its government; and that &s;ooner than &s;ubmit to &s;uch ignomi|nious &s;hackles as tho&s;e he had attempted to impo&s;e, however they might wi&s;h upon all honorable occa&s;ions to avoid them, they would rather ri&s;k the dangers and inconveniencies of a war.</P>
<P>He has, however, endeavoured immediately to follow this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and di&s;honourable article with one which he &s;up|po&s;es, by having the appearance of a favor, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure atone for its di&s;graceful conce&s;&s;ions; this is the one which re&s;pects the trade with their Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements. To tho&s;e who are unacquainted with it, this may at fir&s;t have the appearance of a favor; but upon examination it will ap|pear to be delu&s;ive.

<P>As to tho&s;e parts of the treaty which declare what articles are contraband of war, and which recognize a right to &s;eize and detain our ve&s;&s;els by refu&s;ing to adhere to a maxim which we ought never to depart from, <HI>that free bottoms make free goods;</HI> they are injurious in &s;ome degree to every part of the union, but particularly &s;o to this &s;tate, who&s;e principal exports are provi&s;ions.

<P>We mu&s;t give up becoming, as neutrals, their carriers, or &s;upplying them, in time of &s;carcity, with provi&s;ions. If we are to con&s;ent to their having the right to &s;earch our ve&s;&s;els, or de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain them on any condition, except the one above-mentioned, here is an end of any advantages we are ever to expect from being neutral, and our commerce is pro&s;trated at the feet of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aritime powers: principles which will ju&s;tify all the depre|lations committed, or authorize &s;imilar, are at once e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; and we have but one re&s;ource left, which is, to endeavour by every means we have in our power, to obtain &s;uch a navy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s will give protection to our commerce, and weight to the de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands of our government.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had always been of opinion, and the experience of the pre&s;ent war confirmed it, that the growing commerce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the union required the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a naval force; ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r twelve &s;ail of the line, and a few frigates, would be &s;uffi|cient to an&s;wer all our purpo&s;es.

<PB N="14" REF="028389_0013_0FD8E6C35EDFDAB8">with its rights. Our Mediterranean trade would likewi&s;e be|&s;ecured, and the advantages which would &s;oon accrue to our citizens from having their commerce protected, as well in time of war as peace, would, in a few years, amply repay the ex|pen&s;es of the equipment.</P>
<P>Among the many improper parts of the treaty, he con&s;ider|ed this as the mo&s;t important, and the mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly injurious to our commerce: and while they continued to in&s;i&s;t upon the right to &s;earch and detain our ve&s;&s;els, if there had been no other objection, Mr. Jay &s;hould have refu&s;ed to &s;ign the treaty.</P>
<P>As to the 15th, which is a very important article of the treaty, he had endeavoured upon that to obtain the be&s;t mer|cantile information he could; the re&s;ult is this:&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t clau&s;e places the ve&s;&s;els of America on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e of other foreign nations. This perhaps is as much as we could expect, con&s;i&s;tent with their obligations to other nations; but it ought to be under&s;tood, that by this rule, American ve&s;&s;els going to their European ports, pay from 15 to 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> on a ve&s;&s;el of 150 to 200 tons, more than a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el. To counteract this well became the government of this country; accordingly, the fir&s;t congre&s;s under the new con&s;titution, impo&s;ed a duty on the tonnage of all foreign &s;hips, of 25 cents per ton.</P>
<P>The duty impo&s;ed on American &s;hips in England was under the denomination of <HI>double light money,</HI> &amp;c. and the debates in congre&s;s &s;how the object of laying the 25 cents per ton, to be what is here mentioned. The next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, it being di&s;covered that Great Britain had no inclination to treat with us on &s;ubjects of commerce,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age, February <HI>14, 1790.</HI></NOTE> a further duty was impo&s;|ed on foreign tonnage, equal in the whole to 50 cents per ton. It was at the &s;ame time di&s;covered, that American &s;hips were fully adequate to the carrying all the foreign goods, We&s;t In|dian, European, and A&s;iatic, nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;umption of the country: Congre&s;s, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed a law, that on all fo|reign goods, imported in American &s;hips from Europe or the We&s;t Indies, there &s;hould be a deduction of ten per cent on the amount of duties pre&s;cribed by law. They have &s;ince made the goods imported in American &s;hips pay the whole duty, and foreign &s;hips ten per cent. in addition.</P>
<P>It being clearly a&s;certained, that America could carry on its own India trade, the difference of duty on foreign &s;hips, was
<PB N="15" REF="028389_0014_0FD8E6C4D8438858">in all India commodities as fifteen to ten, making, in effect, a total prohibition again&s;t foreigners in this trade.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e di&s;criminating regulations, American commerce and navigation flouri&s;hed beyond all former example, and al|mo&s;t to exceed belief. Any one, of common ob&s;ervation, may remark the difference in this town. By who&s;e capital and in|fluence, and under what flag, was the commerce of Charle&s;|ton carried on, prior to 1789? At that time, there was hard|ly an American hou&s;e in exten&s;ive trade; and there were not &s;ix &s;hips under the American flag trading out of Charle&s;ton: now American merchants carry on all the trade, and they own more than &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els of large &s;ize, and a much greater pro|portion of &s;maller ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t India trade.</P>
<P>Our fellow citizens at the northward too, have had exclu|&s;ively the India trade, by which, be&s;ides &s;upplying our own citizens with A&s;iatic goods at one fourth the price they were before the revolution, they have exported them to the We&s;t Indies, and even to Europe, making thereby the balance of trade more favorable to the United States. The&s;e re&s;tricti|ons, favorable to American navigation and commerce, did not produce from any European power counter re&s;trictions. The privy council of Great Britain charged a committee of lords, on the &s;ubject of trade, generally to report their opinion on the&s;e mea&s;ures: they took the advice of merchants in the ci|ties of London, Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, and Gla&s;gow, and the re|&s;ult was, that in their opinion the trade with America was &s;o important, that it ought not to be hazarded by har&s;h mea&s;ures, and they recommended an acquie&s;cence in the pre&s;ent re&s;tric|tions, rather than to endeavour a removal of them by retalia|tion. Thus, then, the matter &s;tood when Mr. Jay arrived in England; except that, owing to a contingency, America had &s;o increa&s;ed her navigation as, beyond all di&s;pute, to be fully adequate to the carrying of the produce of the United States.</P>
<P>At this moment Mr. Jay concedes, in the &s;econd &s;ection of the 15th article, "But the Briti&s;h government re&s;erves to it&s;elf the right of impo&s;ing on American ve&s;&s;els entering into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which &s;hall be payable by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the ports of America, and al&s;o &s;uch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and ASIATIC goods, when imported into the United States, in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els."</P>
<P>In the la&s;t part of the 3d &s;ection of the &s;ame article it &s;ays, "It is agreed that the United States will not impo&s;e any new or additional tonnage duty on Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, nor increa&s;e the
<PB N="16" REF="028389_0015_0FD8E6C6569860C8">now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting difference between the duties payable on the im|portation of any articles in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els." The operation of this article will be, that as Briti&s;h goods are gene|rally &s;hipped to America on credit, the condition of the credit will be, that then our (Briti&s;h) &s;hips &s;hall have the freight; and it is not an extravagant idea to pre&s;ume, that the wealth of the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India Company may be employed to cru&s;h the American merchants now in this trade, that they afterwards may enjoy the monopoly of it.</P>
<P>By treaties now exi&s;ting with other nations, they are to be u&s;ed, "as the mo&s;t favored;" and having of right the &s;ame privileges of counteracting the&s;e di&s;criminating duties, they will of cour&s;e exerci&s;e it. The extent of the&s;e injurious con|&s;equences need not be predicted to an intelligent man; every one, even of the meane&s;t capacity, mu&s;t &s;ee in them the &s;peedy and total de&s;truction of American navigation, and of cour&s;e our independent commerce.</P>
<P>There are other parts of the treaty, by which a number of articles are declared to be contraband, that we never con&s;ented to con&s;ider as &s;uch in any other treaties; and attempts are made to make even provi&s;ions come under this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means almo&s;t every article of exportation is declared contraband; and whenever there is a war between the maritime powers, the danger of &s;eizure and condemnation to us will be as great as if we were actually at war our&s;elves.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he would only add, that the 23d, 24th, and 25th articles &s;eem to carry with them very &s;trongly the &s;pirit of the 12th. In them the negociator has endeavoured to render this country as unfriendly as he could to the French, to de&s;troy the tranquillity and order of our &s;ea-ports, and to brand our coun|cils with ingratitude. In them he has di&s;played all his re&s;ent|ment to the only truly u&s;eful and valuable ally we have ever had&mdash;a nation which wi&s;hes to treat with us upon the equality which ought, and indeed mu&s;t be the ba&s;is of every la&s;ting treaty; for without equality few treaties can la&s;t.</P>
<P>Vattel, who&s;e authority will not be doubted, &s;ays, that "Na|tions not being le&s;s obliged than individuals to have a regard to equity, they ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve equality in their treaties. When, therefore, the parties are in &s;uch a &s;tate as to obtain the &s;ame reciprocal advantages, the law of nature requireth their treaties &s;hould be equal, at lea&s;t if there is not &s;ome particular rea&s;on to deviate from that equality; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, would be gratitude for a former benefit, in the hope of becoming unavoidably attached to a nation."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028389_0016_0FD8E6C874D30688">
This is the language of the law of nations on the &s;ubject of the equality of treaties; and comparing the &s;ituation of the two countries, at pre&s;ent, it will not be &s;aid we were not in a &s;tate to obtain reciprocal advantages. We were certainly not bound, by gratitude for former benefits, to make &s;acrifices in their favor; nor has it ever appeared to be the di&s;po&s;ition of our citizens to be &s;o inviolably attached to Great Britain, as to grant them favors which they have never yielded to the more friendly powers of Europe, nor even to tho&s;e to whom they are highly indebted for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their freedom. There mu&s;t then be &s;ome other rea&s;ons for tho&s;e uncommon &s;urren|ders, upon which the public are not yet &s;ufficiently informed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the outlines of the treaty on which you are to de|cide. The &s;hortne&s;s of the time allowed for deliberations, and the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;patch, prevented, he &s;aid, his going as fully into its con&s;equences as he would wi&s;h, or as he may hereafter do, &s;hould it ever come before our legi&s;lature. Indeed it is much to be lamented, that the legi&s;latures of the different &s;tates were not in &s;e&s;&s;ion at this important time, as the &s;enti|ments of the people, expre&s;&s;ed through them, would come with more weight. But the pre&s;ident, to whom the addre&s;s is to be made, will recollect, that by his po&s;tponing the con&s;ider|ation of the treaty from January to June, when none of the &s;tate legi&s;latures were in &s;e&s;&s;ion, the people have been forced to expre&s;s their &s;entiments in this way, or to be &s;ilent on a &s;ubject which has been &s;hown to be of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, and to now re&s;t entirely with him. How awful mu&s;t he feel his &s;ituation! The character, honor, and future commercial con|&s;equence of his country, depending entirely on his determina|tion. If he refu&s;es the treaty, he will be for ever entitled to the thanks and gratitude of his country, for having again &s;aved it from the attempts of an experienced and ambitious rival. If he ratifies it, &s;uch will ever be the love of his country for his pa&s;t &s;ervices, they will always lament that a name, which has hitherto been &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;hould, at the clo&s;e of its career, be voluntarily fixed to &s;o injurious and degrading a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As this is the fir&s;t attempt which has been made by an une|qual and improper treaty, to abridge our rights, and controul the power of congre&s;s in regulating our commerce, it becomes the duty of the friends of their country to expre&s;s their &s;entiments, and to endeavor by every legal means to oppo&s;e its con&s;e|quences, by &s;tating its defects, and preventing, if po&s;&s;ible, its adoption.&mdash;We &s;hould recollect, that treaties, when ratified; have higher authority than laws, becau&s;e they are declared to be the &s;upreme law of the land, and are irrevocable but by the
<PB N="18" REF="028389_0017_0FD8E6C963A9F588">con&s;ent of all the parties to them. That, however de&s;tructive or injurious they may prove to be in their operation, they are without the &s;phere of legi&s;lative redre&s;s or interference: that while the right of regulating commerce remains unimpaired in both hou&s;es of congre&s;s, there can be no doubt of its being properly u&s;ed. This the unexampled increa&s;e of our commerce for &s;ome years, clearly proves, and &s;hows the impropriety of fettering it by treaties. Our policy was to have pur&s;ued the &s;ame mea&s;ures; and in all ca&s;es where any nation invaded our rights and refu&s;ed to do us ju&s;tice, to have endeavored by re|&s;trictions, or, if nece&s;&s;ary, retaliations, to obtain them.</P>
<P>But if, in&s;tead of leaving the regulation of commerce to congre&s;s, from who&s;e u&s;e of it &s;o many benefits have ari&s;en, there &s;hould appear a di&s;po&s;ition to interfere, by the means of treaties, which may hereafter operate to le&s;&s;en our &s;hipping, place us more in the power of foreigners, and de&s;troy that competition which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our obtaining a proper price for our &s;taples; to all the &s;tates, particularly to tho&s;e which are agricultural, it becomes a matter of the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous concern. To no &s;tate can it be more &s;o, than to South Carolina. We are entirely agricultural; and while our commerce is unfettered, and the pre&s;ent competition for our productions encouraged and protected by law&mdash;while we are &s;ure of having American &s;hipping in &s;ufficient numbers to &s;upport our com|mercial rights&mdash;our planters will grow rich, the trade of our merchants become every day more exten&s;ive and re&s;pectable, and our country will be happy. But let it be once known, that, by the interference of an unfortunate and ruinous treaty, a foundation is laid for the diminution of our &s;hipping; that we are not to enjoy the rights of neutrality or an independent commerce; that our ve&s;&s;els are to be liable to &s;eizure, and we are again to look to other nations for the means of tran&s;portati|on, it will at once damp the hopes of our planters and mer|chants, and injure the value of their e&s;tates, check their enter|prizing views, and le&s;&s;en the general happine&s;s. In all enlight|ened countries, &s;ome portion of the happine&s;s of the inhabit|ants mu&s;t depend upon the ea&s;e with which they can acquire property, and the protection which their government is able to afford it. It is the general pur&s;uit of mankind; and few peo|ple can be happy in any country, which either does not or cannot protect them, abroad as well as at home, in their privi|leges and property. The experience of the la&s;t &s;ix years has clearly proved that we po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of national happine&s;s and pro&s;perity within our&s;elves; and it will depend upon the
<PB N="19" REF="028389_0018_0FD8E6CF9754FA08">event of this treaty how far we are to cheri&s;h or part with them.</P>
<P>He &s;aid his opinion always had been, that <HI>countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing within them&s;elves the means of a growing and exten&s;ive commerce, particularly where they con&s;i&s;ted of articles of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, &s;uch as provi&s;ions and raw materials nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport and manufact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res of other nations, ought not, except in very particular ca&s;es, to form treaties of commerce. A nation with the&s;e advan|tages always may, by proper laws and re&s;trictions, render its com|merce more advantageous to its own citizens than foreigners.</HI> By being unfettered with treaties, it continually has it in its power to avail it&s;elf of any advantage the imprudence or &s;ituation of other countries may offer; and to always keep the &s;taff of its commerce in its own hands. It is the opinion of tho&s;e who are be&s;t informed on this &s;ubject, and in which every enlight|ened man mu&s;t concur, that thus &s;ituated, commerce, except|ing the conventions which regard the law of nations, ought not to be the object of negociation.&mdash;That every power, in this regard, &s;hould depend only on it&s;elf. After having made &s;uch regulations as it judges be&s;t, calculated for its &s;ituation, the na|ture of its riches and the indu&s;try of its inhabitants, let it, like England, have courage and con&s;tancy enough never to derogate from them in favor of &s;trangers: all its policy &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in a re&s;olution never to think of forming treaties of commerce, until it finds it&s;elf in &s;ome happy circum&s;tance, which may au|thori&s;e it to demand prerogatives of foreign powers, without pur|cha&s;ing them even with equivalents.</P>
<P>The&s;e are principles which apply to all countries in &s;imilar &s;ituations; but to none more forcibly than to our own, parti|cularly as it re&s;pects Great Britain.</P>
<P>Our commerce, as has been confe&s;&s;ed by their committee of trade, is of the highe&s;t importance to Britain. From her Euro|pean dominions we take her manufactures, and in return &s;end her provi&s;ions and raw materials. The balance, which is ge|nerally again&s;t us, we pay in &s;pecie. So lucrative and import|ant mu&s;t this commerce be to her, that it certainly will always be her intere&s;t to continue and extend it without a treaty. From her We&s;t India i&s;lands, we receive what it is always in our power to obtain from the i&s;lands of the other powers; but in time of &s;earcity, which frequently occurs, they are unable to obtain provi&s;ions and lumber but from America. They are therefore more dependent on us than we are upon them, and our &s;ituation will &s;oon force from them a much more advan|tageous trade than the treaty propo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028389_0019_0FD8E6D24C963AA0">
Upon the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, it will be found that the treaty de&s;erves the cen&s;ure of every friend to his country, and every man el&s;e, who wi&s;hes to &s;ee its commerce exten&s;ive and flouri&s;hing. Even the mo&s;t partial of Mr. Jay's friends confe&s;s it is a bad treaty, and they do not wi&s;h it ratified; but only contend that it is not ju&s;t &s;o infamous as it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be&mdash;But it may here be a&s;ked, has he accompli&s;h|ed a &s;ingle object for which he was &s;ent? Has he obtained complete &s;atisfaction for the depredations in the We&s;t Indies, the delivering of the po&s;ts, compen&s;ation for their detention, and payment for the negroes carried away? Have they, in &s;hort, agreed to do any thing towards executing the treaty of peace, without receiving from us in return a &s;urrender of im|portant commercial rights? In&s;tead of &s;tipulating to make our commerce free, as other nations have done, to whom it is by no means &s;o beneficial, they have expre&s;sly re&s;erved to them|&s;elves the right of &s;earching and carrying off ve&s;&s;els into then ports; while in return, we have granted them every thing they a&s;ked, and more than they could have expected, even if they had given us an advantageous treaty.</P>
<P>From what could this extraordinary &s;urrender of our rights have &s;prung? Was it from ignorance? Was it from de&s;ign? For the honor of our public councils he hoped not from the latter. Some of his friends have &s;uppo&s;ed it to ari&s;e from a want of per|fect knowledge of our exports&mdash;That he did not know that in the United States cotton grew, or that they were ever in the habit of exporting We&s;t India produce to Europe. From whatever cau&s;e it may have ari&s;en, he was &s;ure it could not be conformable to his in&s;tructions. The pre&s;ident was too well acquainted with the intere&s;ts of his country; he mu&s;t have recollected that her dignity and his own character were too intimately connect|ed: that he could not &s;acrifice the one without tarni&s;hing the other. He certainly could never have given &s;uch in&s;truc|tions. We know we can tru&s;t him; and he wi&s;hed that the event had proved that we could have tru&s;ted Mr. Jay as well.</P>
<P>He concluded with declaring his opinion of the treaty to be, that it was injurious to the commercial rights, and de|grading to the character of his country; ungrateful to our allies; and that it was our duty by a re&s;pectful, but forcible addre&s;s, to &s;tate our opinion, and reque&s;t the pre&s;ident not to ratify it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>J. THOMPSON'S SPEECH. Speech of Mr. J. Thomp&s;on,</HI> At a Meeting of the Citizens of Peter&s;hurg, convened Augu&s;t <HI>1, 1795,</HI> to debate on the pending Treaty with Britain.</HEAD>
<P>THE magnitude of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and the danger of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, render this meeting peculiarly pro|per. We are called upon to examine a treaty, which in|volves the mo&s;t precious rights, the mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts, the commerce, the peace, and the honor of America. A conci&s;e hi&s;torical detail will unfold the peculiar circum&s;tances in which America &s;tood prior to the emba&s;&s;y which produced this treaty. The king of Great Britain, who has &s;worn eternal enmity to republics, acceded at an early period to that combination, which has convul&s;ed Europe, in attempting to &s;tifle the liberty of France. Under the obnoxious pretext of attempting to &s;tarve thirty millions of men, he i&s;&s;ued orders for intercepting the corre&s;pondence, and plundering the commerce of neutral nations. He had long viewed with indignant &s;orrow, the ra|pid progre&s;s which the Americans made, in &s;pite of all the ob&s;tacles he could impo&s;e by commercial re&s;trictions, or by flagrant violations of the treaty of 1783. The de&s;truction of our ri&s;ing commerce, the annihilation of our growing naviga|tion, were the objects contemplated by the&s;e nefarious orders. They were executed with all the diligence, and all the oppre&s;|&s;ion which rapacity can practice. A patriotic phalanx in con|gre&s;s propo&s;ed every expedient which wi&s;dom could dictate, to obtain compen&s;ation for the&s;e injuries: but our illu&s;trious pre|&s;ident, animated by paternal &s;olicitude for the welfare of Ame|rica, gently in&s;inuated to congre&s;s, that the &s;ubject was out of their juri&s;diction, and appointed our chief ju&s;tice to per|form the honorable duty of declaring the indignation, and de|manding the rights of an injured people. If &s;tern ari&s;tocracy had not &s;teeled his bo&s;om again&s;t the generous &s;en&s;ations of pa|trioti&s;m&mdash;if gratitude, &s;en&s;ibility, and honor, had not been en|veloped in the &s;able gloom of political prejudice, he mu&s;t have been animated by a magnanimity worthy of his country. In the pre&s;ence of venal pride and courtly profligacy, even at the foot&s;tool of the throne, he would have pre&s;erved the atti|tude of dignity, and &s;poken the language of truth. But ba&s;e|ly apo&s;tatizing from republican principles, he &s;tooped to offer the incen&s;e of flattery to a tyrant, the &s;courge of his country, the foe of mankind. After a long negociation, in which he
<PB N="22" REF="028389_0021_0FD8E6DBB6BFCAF8">happily practi&s;ed the arts of diplomatic flattery, he has pre&s;ent|ed this treaty to his expecting country. It has received, in every article but one, the &s;anction of the &s;enate. The con|duct of that a&s;&s;embly has, indeed, been uniform. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal government, it has never deigned to adopt the &s;entiments of the people, or to communicate in own, except in the dignified form of laws and treaties. The maje&s;ty of that a&s;&s;embly has never been polluted by the vile feet of the <HI>&s;wini&s;h</HI> multitude.

<P><PB N="23" REF="028389_0022_0FD8E6DF4E4E5698">
The objections I &s;hall make to it are, fir&s;t, on account of the articles it does not contain; and, &s;econdly, on account of the articles it does contain. It ought to have been expre&s;sly &s;tipu|lated, that the king of Great Britain &s;hould interpo&s;e for us his good offices with the piratical &s;tates, or at lea&s;t that he &s;hould not negociate a peace between Portugal and Algiers, which &s;hould again render tho&s;e plunderers the tyrants of the ocean. His recent conduct in that quarter had very materially injured us&mdash;but no provi&s;ion again&s;t a repetition of it, has been made by our mini&s;ter. By the French treaty, concluded in the year 1778, in the tumultuous moments which attend the cri&s;is of liberty, by a government &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed for imbecility, this protection from Algerine cor&s;airs, was expre&s;sly given by a king, from whom we had nothing to demand, and every thing to &s;ue, and to whom we granted privileges much le&s;s important, than tho&s;e we now grant.</P>
<P>A &s;tipulation ought to have been in&s;i&s;ted on for ample com|pen&s;ation for the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts&mdash;a detention which has defrauded America of the immen&s;e profits of the fur trade, and which has produced a long, bloody, and di&s;a&s;|trous Indian war.</P>
<P>A &s;tipulation ought to have been made that Briti&s;h &s;hips of war &s;hould protect American &s;hips at &s;ea. Although the arti|eles relative to armed &s;hips appear to be mutual; yet, &s;ince we have no armed &s;hips, we receive no con&s;ideration for the pri|vileges we grant theirs. Here another advantage is given to us by the French treaty, which this denies.</P>
<P>As I have been forced to anticipate the compari&s;on between the two treaties, I will now continue it, and then &s;tate my ob|jections to the articles contained in the treaty. The French are by treaty to pay no higher duties than the mo&s;t favored nations pay. In the year 1778, we refu&s;ed to admit even tho&s;e generous allies into our ports upon the &s;ame terms with citizens. By this treaty the Briti&s;h are to be admitted on the &s;ame terms with American merchants. But the French, the Dutch, and the Spaniards, are entitled to pay no higher duties than the mo&s;t favored nations. If this treaty is ratified, they will be obliged to pay no higher duties than American merchants. This treaty then almo&s;t annihilates the di&s;tinction between fo|reigners and natives; which we refu&s;ed to relinqui&s;h in favor of our allies and protectors in the epoch of danger and infancy &mdash;Let this prove with what abject humility we pro&s;trate before the Briti&s;h king.</P>
<P>By the 2d article of the French treaty, it is provided, that enemies' property &s;hall not be taken out of American ve&s;&s;els&mdash;
<PB N="24" REF="028389_0023_0FD8E6E1517A1730">the French cannot take out of American ve&s;&s;els Briti&s;h pro|perty. By this treaty it is provided, that enemies' property may be taken out of American ve&s;&s;els. The Briti&s;h may take out of American ve&s;&s;els French property. The object of this arti|cle was, to give the &s;anction of America to tho&s;e atrocious robberies, which have wre&s;ted from the wretched We&s;t Indian exile, the la&s;t pittance of de&s;pairing poverty. By the French treaty, the carrying trade of enemies' property, not only from neutral ports to enemies' ports, but from enemies' ports to ene|mies' ports, is given us&mdash;By this treaty, that valuable &s;ource of wealth is denied us. By the French treaty it is declared that they &s;hall not intercept American ve&s;&s;els bound with pro|vi&s;ions to the ports of their enemies&mdash;By this treaty it is de|clared, that the Briti&s;h may intercept American ve&s;&s;els bound with provi&s;ions to the ports of their enemies. The French then cannot intercept American ve&s;&s;els bound with provi&s;ions to the ports of Great Britain; but the Briti&s;h can intercept American ve&s;&s;els bound with provi&s;ions to the ports of the French republic. The object of this article was to render America acce&s;&s;ary to the nefarious &s;cheme of exciting, by the agency of famine, in&s;urrection and di&s;order, which may either exterminate or en&s;lave the French. The object of this article was to render America a cowardly confederate, concealing, under the venerable form of friend&s;hip, the vile&s;t malice. And &s;hall this treaty di&s;&s;olve the compact made by nature between the two republics, &s;ecured by &s;eelings generous and inexpre&s;&s;i|ble, guaranteed by all the &s;oft &s;en&s;ibilities of the human heart? Shall this treaty force the Americans, the fir&s;t people who &s;acrificed at the altar of liberty, to join the ruthle&s;s de&s;pots, who march to de&s;olate France, to re&s;tore the altars of a bar|barous &s;uper&s;tition, and to extingui&s;h the cele&s;tial light which has bur&s;t upon the human mind? O! my countrymen, when you are capable of &s;uch mon&s;trous ba&s;ene&s;s, even the patriot will invoke upon you the contempt of ages.</P>
<P>The man who can he&s;itate, after this compari&s;on, to pro|nounce that our amba&s;&s;ador, and the majority of our &s;enate, prefer Briti&s;h principles and Briti&s;h connections, to French principles and French connections, mu&s;t be timid in thought, and &s;ervile in &s;entiment. Yes, they prefer that mouldering, Gothic edifice, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, to the elegant temple of liberty, which philo&s;ophy has ju&s;t erected in France.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article of this treaty permits the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;ettled in the we&s;tern po&s;ts, to elect to remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects at tho&s;e po&s;ts, even after they are ceded. This article not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iolates the &s;acred principles of the common law, which de|clares
<PB N="25" REF="028389_0024_0FD8E6E154B763F8">that aliens cannot hold landed property, but operates as an indirect repeal of the late law of congre&s;s with re&s;pect to naturalization. If the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have the power of repealing indirectly, or contravening even remotely, the laws, we are &s;laves! If they have not this power, a ratification will be an u&s;urpation. Men, &s;ituated within the territory of the United States, and holding immen&s;e landed property, will, in ca&s;e of a rupture with Great Britain, be bound to attack our defencele&s;s fellow citizens &s;ituated near them, to join the ho&s;tile Indians, and rai&s;e the war whoop of &s;avage cruelty. By this article, the we&s;tern po&s;ts are ceded by America to Great Bri|tain, until June, 1796. The power of ceding territory can only be exerci&s;ed by congre&s;s. If this treaty is ratified, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate will u&s;urp it. I contend that the ce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e po&s;ts for one &s;ingle day, was as uncon&s;titutional as the ce&s;&s;ion of them for ten thou&s;and years. Previous arrange|ments are to be made. What arrangements? Will not the Briti&s;h government propo&s;e &s;ome unrea&s;onable arrangement, and then ju&s;tify a further detention of the po&s;ts by our refu&s;al to make it?</P>
<P>The third article, like every other, wants that reciprocity which &s;hould pervade the whole treaty. In return for the im|portant privilege of trading to all our ports, &s;ubject to no higher duties than our own citizens, of bringing to our ports, in ve&s;&s;els of any de&s;cription, the produce of any country on the face of the globe, we have the poor privilege of carrying to the ports of Great Britain the produce of our own country only, and of trading to the We&s;t Indies in fi&s;hing boats for two years, provided we covenant not to export any produce imported from tho&s;e i&s;lands. This article is a regulation of commerce. The con&s;titution gives the power of regulating commerce to congre&s;s. A ratification will be an u&s;urpation of this power. This objection embraces almo&s;t the whole treaty. Boldly a&s;&s;uming the name of a compact concerning commerce, it di&s;dains to render the con&s;titution even the homage of hypo|cri&s;y. Here the ab&s;urdity of giving to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate the power of making treaties becomes apparent. All treaties either regulate commerce, or cede territory, or conclude a war, by leaving things in <HI>&s;tatu quo.</HI> Treaties of the fir&s;t and &s;econd kind cannot be con&s;titutionally made by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate&mdash;Treaties of the third kind hardly ever occur. Be|&s;ides, our con&s;titution ab&s;urdly gives to one body the power of making war, and to another the power of fini&s;hing it.</P>
<P>By the &s;ixth article, the American government is to a&s;&s;ume the payment of Briti&s;h debts. This a&s;&s;umption is uncon&s;titu|tional.
<PB N="26" REF="028389_0025_0FD8E6E2CFAC11D8">All the power of the federal government with re&s;pect to debts, is given, by a conci&s;e article of the con&s;titution, which declares that congre&s;s &s;hall pay the debts of America. It is evident, that no &s;tipulations with re&s;pect to debts, can con&s;titutionally be made by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. This ar|ticle manife&s;ts the ari&s;tocratical &s;pirit, of which I have accu&s;ed our late amba&s;&s;ador and the majority of the &s;enate, by being uncon&s;titutional, by accu&s;ing the &s;tate legi&s;latures which eman|cipated America, of atrocious inju&s;tice, and by increa&s;ing that debt which has already created an influence independent of the people.

<P>What article of the con&s;titution authori&s;es the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to e&s;tabli&s;h a judiciary colo&s;&s;us, which is to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and with one foot on America and with the other on Britain, and drag the reluctant governments of tho&s;e countries to the altar of ju&s;|tice?

Or are our new friends, the Briti&s;h, to be preferred for their ju&s;tice and gene|ro&s;ity?

The ninth article invades the rights of this commonwealth, by contemplating the ca&s;e of Denny Fairfax.</P>
<P>The tenth article deprives congre&s;s of the power of &s;eque&s;tra|tion; and if the pre&s;ident and &s;enate can deprive it of this power, they can deprive it of all powers.</P>
<P>Since the &s;enate have had the mode&s;ty to reject the twelfth article, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that is unnece&s;&s;ary, except to &s;how that the &s;ervile conde&s;cen&s;ion of our amba&s;&s;ador &s;tartled even them.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t article attacks the &s;acred rights of expatria|tion. By this article, an American citizen who abjures his country, becomes a citizen of the French republic, and re&s;ides there twenty years, may be puni&s;hed as a pirate, if he accepts a French commi&s;&s;ion. This article defines piracy. The pow|er of defining piracy is given by the con&s;titution to congre&s;s. If the treaty is ratified, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate will u&s;urp this power too.</P>
<P>The twenty-third and twenty-fourth articles are incompati|ble with the 17th of the French treaty. It is true, that a &s;weeping clau&s;e declares, that &s;tipulations contained in this treaty, &s;hall not affect treaties exi&s;ting with other nations. But the king of Great Britain denies that the French are a na|tion. Be&s;ides, &s;ince the clau&s;e expre&s;&s;es nothing more than the law of nations implies, it is mere &s;urplu&s;age. It mu&s;t be re|jected, and then the repugnancy of the two treaties becomes manife&s;t.</P>
<P>I will now recapitulate the u&s;urpations which the pre&s;ident and &s;enate will make if the treaty is ratified. They will u&s;urp the power of making rules with re&s;pect to aliens, of ceding territory, of regulating commerce, of paying debts, of regula|ting duties, of e&s;tabli&s;hing courts, and of defining piracies. The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives will be degraded to a hou&s;e of commons; &s;ummoned to an&s;wer an addre&s;s, to regulate a few &s;ubjects of internal policy, and to vote money. But this trea|ty will not be ratified. The illu&s;trious pre&s;ident, who admini|&s;ters our government, will not abandon, in his venerable old age, the generous maxims, the nice honor, the pure virtue, and the ardent patrioti&s;m, which have elevated him to &s;ave his country. He will view with indignation, the gigantic wicked|ne&s;s, which &s;eeks, through the medium of a perfidious treaty, to render him an apo&s;tate, and to de&s;troy at one blow, the commerce, the con&s;titution, and the honor of his country.</P>

<P>He ob&s;erved, that it would be unnece&s;&s;ary, he believed, to &s;ay any thing on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in vindication of this re&s;olution; he had no doubt but that all tho&s;e who &s;urround|ed him, were well convinced that this a&s;&s;embly emanated from the con&s;titution; and in his opinion it was one of the pure&s;t &s;treams that flowed from that great fountain.<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">"Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law re&s;pecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e thereof; or abridging the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s; <HI>or the right of the people peace|ably to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;emble, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to petition the government for a redre&s;s of grievances.</HI>" Article III, of the amendments to the federal con&s;titution, propo&s;ed by congre&s;s, and ratified by the legi&s;latures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal &s;tates, pur&s;uant to the fifth article of the original con&s;titution.</NOTE> Every re|flecting man mu&s;t be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with this important truth, that it was the unalienable right of the people to a&s;|&s;emble

<P>The chairman having put the que&s;tion, the re&s;olution was unanimou&s;ly adopted.</P>
<P>It was then moved, that the treaty &s;hould be read, and a pub|lic di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its merits take place.</P>
<P>But it was ob&s;erved by &s;ome, that the reading of it would take up too much time; that every body mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed now to be acquainted with its contents; and that there were many per&s;ons pre&s;ent, who had to return home &s;ome di&s;tance in the country.</P>
<P>A great number, however, declared that it was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent any reflections being thrown on their proceedings, to have the treaty read, and to permit a free di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion on this occa&s;ion. The meeting at New York had been highly criminated on this very account; and they hoped, there|fore, that the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly would have more prudence than to lay them&s;elves open to the &s;ame a&s;per&s;ions which had been ca&s;t upon others.</P>
<P>The gentlemen having withdrawn their oppo&s;ition, the mo|tion was unanimou&s;ly agreed to.</P>
<P>Whereupon the treaty was read by the &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Mr. Rodney &s;aid he was not &s;o anxious to expre&s;s his own &s;entiments on this occa&s;ion, as he was to hear the opinion of a venerable patriot in that hou&s;e, who&s;e head had grown grey in the faithful di&s;charge of his duties in the legi&s;lative, judicial, and executive departments of government.</P>
<P>John Dickin&s;on then ro&s;e, and ob&s;erved, that he had felt it his duty to appear on this momentous occa&s;ion, and publicly avow his &s;entiments concerning this treaty; but as the hand of age and infirmity was upon him, he hoped that &s;ome younger citizen than him&s;elf would take the labouring oar, and break the way, in order that the elder might the more ea&s;ily follow. When that was done, the duty he owed to him&s;elf and his country, be &s;aid, would compel him to expre&s;s his feel|ing on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. RODNEY &s;aid, that as it was the wi&s;h of the gentle|man who had ju&s;t &s;at down, that &s;ome younger per&s;on than him&s;elf &s;hould lead the way to this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he would offer a &s;ew general ob&s;ervations on the treaty, which they had now fully and fairly before them, for their con&s;ideration. He did not intend to go through with it article by article; he only meant to touch &s;lightly on &s;ome of the principal objections, and leave the re&s;t to a more able hand; indeed it would be in vain to at|tempt
<PB N="30" REF="028389_0029_0FD8E6ED56588520">to notice every objection, for the &s;ubject of objection appeared to him to be exhau&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>Before he proceeded to the immediate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the trea|ty it&s;elf, he reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to make a &s;ew candid re|marks upon what he thought (and &s;urely, &s;aid he, in a free country, every man has a right to think, and a right to ex|pre&s;s his opinions, too) the extraordinary manner in which this treaty had been brought about. In the fir&s;t place, at the very moment when the repre&s;entatives of the people were de|liberating on the be&s;t mode of obtaining redre&s;s and &s;atisfacti|on for the injuries and in&s;ults we had &s;u&s;tained, and the griev|ances under which we then laboured; at that moment their proceedings were unfortunately arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the next place, the chief ju&s;tice of the United States was appointed (without a re&s;ignation) to the important office of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary to the court of Britain; if the&s;e mea&s;ures were not again&s;t the letter, they were &s;urely again&s;t the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution. Be&s;ides, was it ever heard of by any one, that Mr. Jay was di&s;patched for the purpo&s;e of making a treaty with Britain?

He had two general objections to the treaty it&s;elf. He was one of tho&s;e who thought it would be for the real intere&s;t of America to have no treaty at all with Britain; five years out of &s;even &s;he had the &s;word un&s;heathed, and the temple of Janus open. As our object ought to be (&s;aid he) and I hope ever will be, peace, we &s;hould carefully &s;hun all connection with &s;uch a nation, for fear of being involved in her quarrels: But at this time, when &s;he was at war with the French republic, our generous and brave ally, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted us when &s;truggling in the &s;ame cau&s;e, and when the flag of freedom drooped under the iron rod of oppre&s;&s;ion, it was the height of folly to form &s;uch a treaty with her: For even &s;uppo&s;ing France and Britain were equally indifferent to us (and who is there that hears me, who&s;e bo&s;om is &s;o frozen with ingratitude, as to view them
<PB N="32" REF="028389_0031_0FD8E6F05401EAF0">with equal indifference) a treaty &s;o pointedly levelled at the French as this appears to be throughout, and which gives up to Britain privileges which will put it in her power &s;o materially to injure them, might by the law of nations be con&s;trued a breach of that neutrality which we &s;een one and all to be &s;o anxious to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>Mr. Chairman (he proceeded) the omi&s;&s;ions in this treaty are numerous and important. If the me&s;&s;age of the pre&s;ident is to be taken as the ground-work of the envoy's in&s;tructions, and I think it ought, he was &s;ent to procure a <HI>friendly adju&s;tment of our complaints;</HI><NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">See extract from the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age in note 2.</NOTE> and among&s;t tho&s;e complaints, what were the fir&s;t? and which &s;tared us foremo&s;t in the face? Our we&s;t|ern po&s;ts had been detained from us ever &s;ince the peace, con|trary to treaty; in con&s;equence of which we had been expo&s;ed to a ruinous Indian war; property to an immen&s;e amount had been taken off by the Briti&s;h, in contravention of the &s;ame treaty; our &s;ailors had been cruelly and unju&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed from on board our ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that they were unable, for want of hands, to return, if liberty had been given them to depart. Are any damages obtained for the detention of the po&s;ts the&s;e thirteen years? No! Are any obtained for the blood of our fellow citizens lavi&s;hed, and the trea&s;ures of the people &s;pent in the Indian war? Or for the innocent women and children who have fallen a &s;acrifice to &s;avage cruelty, and the murdering tomahawk and &s;calping knife? No! Is the property unju&s;tly carried off by the Briti&s;h, &s;tipulated to be paid for? No! Has any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been made to &s;ecure our helple&s;s &s;eamen from being dragged from on board our merchant &s;hips? No! After all the lo&s;&s;es the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> intere&s;t has &s;u&s;tained on this very account, they have been &s;till left to the mercy of a mercile&s;s nation.</P>
<P>The third article, giving the Briti&s;h the benefit of all our Atlantic ports and inland navigation, and entirely excluding us, on their part, from both, requires no comment; it will not, for I am &s;ure it cannot, be contended that there is any recipro|city here.</P>
<P>That article &s;hould never have been admitted, which puts the &s;tale claims of Briti&s;h creditors on a footing with our plain demands for the plunder of our merchants; on a footing, did I &s;ay? on a far better footing; for while in the one ca&s;e, by a &s;ummary mode of procedure, our citizens are robbed of that

<P>Mr. Chairman (added he) the great object, if I am not mi&s;|taken, of our government, has been to continue neutral during the war which at pre&s;ent convul&s;es the greater part of Europe; and yet while we are &s;truggling to pre&s;erve this happy &s;ituation, in order that the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and plenty may pour in up|on us, we find in this treaty all the rights of neutrality aban|doned, and the axe laid to the root of the very tree from which we expected to gather &s;uch abundant fruit. The great principle of neutrality, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the very exi&s;tence of commerce, <HI>that free bottoms &s;hall make free goods,</HI> is here given up; a principle, &s;ince the year 1780, e&s;tabli&s;hed as the law of nations. I know, previous to that year, the arbitrary and &s;upe|rior power of Britain had ruled it otherwi&s;e; but then the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, in conjunction with Sweden and Denmark, e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>armed neutrality,</HI> the very &s;econd article of which recognized this principle, and in &s;upport of which Ru&s;&s;ia re|fers to her treaty with Britain in 1734, in which this principle is indi&s;putably e&s;tabli&s;hed. To the&s;e principles the commercial nations of Europe fully acceded&mdash;Agreeably to the&s;e principles, Britain afterwards uniformly conducted her&s;elf during the American war; and to the&s;e principles we have rigidly adhered in every treaty hitherto made, and the Briti&s;h them&s;elves in their treaty with France in 1786.<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Articles of the armed neutrality.

<P>IN every act of my admini&s;tration, I have &s;ought the hap|pine&s;s of my fellow citizens. My &s;y&s;tem, for the attainment of this object, has uniformly been, to overlook all per&s;onal, local, and partial con&s;iderations; to contemplate the United States as one great whole; to confide, that &s;udden impre&s;&s;ions, when erroneous, would yield to candid reflection; and to con|&s;ult only the &s;ub&s;tantial and permanent intere&s;ts of our country.</P>
<P>Nor have I departed from this line of conduct, on the occa|&s;ion which has produced the re&s;olutions contained in your letter of the 13th in&s;t.</P>
<P>Without a predilection for my own judgment, I have weighed with attention, every argument which has, at any time, been brought into view. But the con&s;titution is the guide which I ne|ver can abandon. It has a&s;&s;igned to the pre&s;ident the power of making treaties, with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate. It was doubtle&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e two branches of government would combine, without pa&s;&s;ion, and with the be&s;t means of information, tho&s;e facts and principles upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of our foreign relations will always depend; that they ought not to &s;ub&s;titute for their own conviction the opinions of others; or to &s;eek truth through any channel but that of a temperate and well informed inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, I have re&s;olved on the manner of executing the duty before me. To the high re&s;pon&s;ibility attach|ed to it, I freely &s;ubmit: and you, gentlemen, are at liberty to make the&s;e &s;entiments known as the grounds of my procedure.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS On the con&s;titutional Power to form Treaties.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract from one of the Federal Farmer's Letters, dated January <HI>10, 1788.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON a fair con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, I think the legi&s;|lature has a proper controul over the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, in &s;ettling commercial treaties.&mdash;By one article, "the legi&s;lature &s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations," &amp;c. and by another article, "the pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of two-thirds of the &s;enate, &s;hall have power to make treaties." The&s;e clau&s;es mu&s;t be con&s;idered together; and we ought never to make one part of the &s;ame in&s;trument contradict ano|ther, if it can be avoided by any rea&s;onable con&s;truction. By the fir&s;t recited clau&s;e, the legi&s;lature has <HI>the power,</HI> that is, as I under&s;tand it, <HI>the &s;ole power,</HI> to regulate commerce with foreign nations, or to make all the rules and regulations re&s;pecting trade and commerce, between our citizens and foreigners. By the &s;econd recited clau&s;e, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have power generally to make treaties.&mdash;There are &s;everal kinds of treaties, as treaties of commerce, of peace, of alliance, &amp;c.

<HEAD>Defence of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was to have been fore&s;een, that the treaty which mr. Jay was charged to negociate with Great-Britain, whene|ver it &s;hould appear, would have to contend with many per|ver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;ome hone&s;t prejudices; that there was no mea&s;ure in which the government could engage, &s;o little likely to be viewed according to its intrin&s;ic merits&mdash;&s;o very likely to encounter mi&s;conception, jealou&s;y, and unrea|&s;onable di&s;like. For this, many rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is only to know the vanity and vindictivene&s;s of human nature, to be convinced, that while this generation la&s;ts, there will always exi&s;t among us, men irreconcilable to our pre&s;ent national con&s;titution; embittered in their animo&s;ity in propor|tion to the &s;ucce&s;s of its operations, and the di&s;appointment of their inau&s;picious predictions. It is a material inference from this, that &s;uch men will watch, with lynx's eyes, for op|portunities of di&s;crediting the proceedings of the government, and will di&s;play a ho&s;tile and malignant zeal upon every oc|ca&s;ion, where they think there are any prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the community to favour their enterprizes. A treaty with Great-Britain was too fruitful an occa&s;ion not to call forth all their activity.</P>
<P>It is only to con&s;ult the hi&s;tory of nations, to perceive, that every country, at all times, is cur&s;ed by the exi&s;tence of men, who, actuated by an irregular ambition, &s;cruple nothing which they imagine will contribute to their own advancement and importance: in monarchies, &s;upple courtiers; in republics, fawning or turbulent demagogues, wor&s;hipping &s;till the idol, power, wherever placed, whether in the hands of a prince or of the people, and trafficing in the weakne&s;&s;es, vices, frailties, or prejudices of the one or the other. It was to have been ex|pected, that &s;uch men, counting more on the pa&s;&s;ions than on the rea&s;on of their fellow citizens, and anticipating that the treaty would have to &s;truggle with prejudices, would be di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="42" REF="028389_0041_0FD8E70D9120DB70">to make an alliance with popular di&s;content, to nouri&s;h it, and to pre&s;s it into the &s;ervice of their particular views.</P>
<P>It was not to have been doubted, that there would be one or more foreign powers, indi&s;po&s;ed to a mea&s;ure which accom|modated our differences with Great-Britain, and laid the foundation of future good under&s;tanding, merely becau&s;e it had that effect.</P>
<P>Nations are never content to confine their rival&s;hips and enmities to them&s;elves. It is their u&s;ual policy, to di&s;&s;eminate them as widely as they can, regardle&s;s how far it may interfere with the tranquillity or happine&s;s of the nations which they are able to influence.&mdash;Whatever preten&s;ions may be made, the world is yet remote from the &s;pectacle of that ju&s;t and ge|nerous policy, whether in the cabinets of republies or of king which would di&s;po&s;e one nation, in its intercour&s;es with ano|ther&mdash; &s;atisfied with a due proportion of privileges and benefits to &s;ee that other pur&s;ue freely, its true intere&s;t with rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to a third; though at the expen&s;e of no engagement, not i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> violation of any rule of friendly or fair procedure.

<P>It was known, that the re&s;entment produced by our re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|lution war with Great-Britain, had never been entirely extin|gui&s;hed, and that recent injuries had re-kindled the flame wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> additional violence.

<P>It was not to be mi&s;taken, that an enthu&s;ia&s;m for France
<PB N="43" REF="028389_0042_0FD8E716F31AB3E0">and her revolution, throughout all its wonderful vici&s;&s;itudes, has continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of the great body of the people of this country; and it was to be inferred, that this &s;en|timent would predi&s;po&s;e to a jealou&s;y of any agreement or treaty with her mo&s;t per&s;evering competitor&mdash;a jealou&s;y &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive, as would give the fulle&s;t &s;cope to in&s;idious arts to per|plex and mi&s;lead the public opinion. It was well under&s;tood, that a numerous party among us, though di&s;avowing the de&s;ign, becau&s;e the avowal would defeat it, have been &s;teadily endea|vouring to make the United States a party in the pre&s;ent Euro|pean war, by advocating all tho&s;e mea&s;ures which would widen the breach betweeen us and Great-Britain, and by re&s;i&s;ting all tho&s;e which would tend to clo&s;e it; and it was morally cer|tain, that this party would eagerly improve every circum&s;tance which could &s;erve to render the treaty odious, and to fru&s;trate it, as the mo&s;t effectual road to their favourite goal.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o known beforehand, that per&s;onal and party ri|val&s;hips, of the mo&s;t active kind, would a&s;&s;ail whatever treaty might be made, to di&s;grace, if po&s;&s;ible, its organ.</P>
<P>There are three per&s;ons prominent in the public eye, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the actual pre&s;ident of the United States, in the event of his retreat from the &s;tation, mr. Adams, mr. Jay, and mr. Jeffer&s;on.</P>
<P>No one has forgotten the &s;y&s;tematic pains which have been taken to impair the well-earned popularity of the fir&s;t gentle|man. Mr. Jay, too, has been repeatedly the object of attacks with the &s;ame view. His friends, as well as his enemies, anti|cipated that he could make no treaty which would not fur|ni&s;h weapons again&s;t him: and it were to have been ignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adver&s;aries, to have doubted that they would be &s;eized with eagerne&s;s and wielded with dex|terity.</P>
<P>The peculiar circum&s;tances which have attended the two la&s;t elections for governor of this &s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New-York.</NOTE>, have been of a nature to give the utmo&s;t keenne&s;s to party animo&s;ity. It was impo&s;|&s;ible that mr. Jay &s;hould be forgiven for his double, and, in the la&s;t in&s;tance, triumphant &s;ucce&s;s; or that any promi&s;ing opportunity of detaching from him the public confidence, &s;hould pa&s;s unimproved.</P>
<P>Trivial facts frequently throw light upon important de|&s;igns. It is remarkable, that in the toa&s;ts given on the 4th of
<PB N="44" REF="028389_0043_0FD8E7181098EE90">July, wherever there appears a direct or indirect cen&s;ure of the treaty, it is pretty uniformly coupled with compli|ments to mr. Jeffer&s;on, and to our late governor, mr. Clin|ton, with an evident de&s;ign to place tho&s;e gentlemen in contra&s;t with mr. Jay, and, decrying him, to elevate them. No one can be blind to the &s;inger of party &s;pirit, vi&s;ible in the&s;e and &s;imilar tran&s;actions. It indicates to us clearly, one powerful &s;ource of oppo&s;ition to the treaty.</P>
<P>No man is without his per&s;onal enemies. Pre-eminence even in talents and virtue is a cau&s;e of envy and hatred of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Bad men are the natural enemies of virtuous men. Good men &s;ometimes mi&s;take and di&s;like each other.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch an occa&s;&s;ion as the treaty, how could it hap|pen otherwi&s;e, than that <HI>per&s;onal enmity</HI> would be unu&s;ually bu&s;y, enterpri&s;ing, and malignant?</P>
<P>From the combined operation of the&s;e different cau&s;es, it would have been a vain expectation that the treaty would be generally contemplated with candour and moderation, or that rea&s;on would regulate the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions concern|ing it. It was certain, on the contrary, that however unex|ceptionable its true character might be, it would have to &s;ight its way through a ma&s;s of unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition; and that time, examination, and reflection, would be requi|&s;ite to &s;ix the public opinion on a true ba&s;is. It was certain that it would become the in&s;trument of a &s;y&s;tematic effort again&s;t the national government and its admini&s;tration; a decided engine of party to advance its own views at the ha|zard of the public peace and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The events which have already taken place, are a full comment on the&s;e po&s;itions. If the good &s;en&s;e of the peo|ple does not &s;peedily di&s;countenance the projects which are on foot, more melancholy proofs may &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Before the treaty was known, attempts were made to pro|po&s;&s;e&s;s the public mind again&s;t it. It was ab&s;urdly a&s;&s;erted, that it was not expected by the people, that mr. Jay was to make any treaty; as if he had been &s;ent, not to accommo|date differences by negociation and agreement, but to dictate to Great-Britain the terms of an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before it was publi&s;hed at large, a &s;ketch, calculated to produce fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, was handed out to the public, through a medium noted for ho&s;tility to the admini&s;tration of the government.&mdash;E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;aries flew through the country, &s;preading alarm and di&s;content: the leaders of clubs were
<PB N="45" REF="028389_0044_0FD8E71A4F7346C8">every where active to &s;eize the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, and pre-occupy their judgments again&s;t the treaty.</P>
<P>At Bo&s;ton it was publi&s;hed one day, and the next a town|meeting was convened to condemn it, without ever being read; without any &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;entence was pro|nounced again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Will any man &s;eriou&s;ly believe, that in &s;o &s;hort a time, an in&s;trument of this nature could have been tolerably under|&s;tood by the greater part of tho&s;e who were thus induced to a condemnation of it? Can the re&s;ult be con&s;idered as any thing more than a &s;udden ebullition of popular pa&s;&s;ion, ex|cited by the artifices of a party, which had adroitly &s;eized a favourable moment to furorize the public opinion; this &s;pi|rit of precipitation and the intemperance which accompanied it, prevented the body of the merchants and the greater part of the mo&s;t con&s;iderate citizens, from attending the meeting, and left tho&s;e who met wholly under the guidance of a &s;et of men, who, with two or three exceptions, have been the uniform oppo&s;ers of the government.</P>
<P>The intelligence of this event had no &s;ooner reached New-York, than the leaders of the clubs were &s;een haranguing in every corner of the city, to &s;tir up our citizens into an imi|tation of the example of the meeting at Bo&s;ton. An invita|tion to meet at the city-hall quickly followed, not to con&s;ider or di&s;cu&s;s the merits of the treaty, but to unite with the meet|ing at Bo&s;ton to addre&s;s the pre&s;ident again&s;t its ratification.</P>

<P>PREVIOUS to a more particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merits of the treaty, it may be u&s;eful to advert to a &s;ugge&s;tion which has been thrown out, namely, That it was fore&s;een by many, that the mi&s;&s;ion to Great-Britain would produce no good re&s;ult, and that the event has corre&s;ponded with the an|ticipation.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of this po&s;ition is manife&s;tly true.</P>
<P>All mu&s;t remember the very critical po&s;ture of this coun|try, at the time that mi&s;&s;ion was re&s;olved upon. A recent viola|tion of our rights, too flagrant and too injurious to be &s;ub|mitted to, had filled every American brea&s;t with indignation, and every prudent man with alarm and di&s;quietude. A few hoped, and the great body of the community feared, that war was inevitable.</P>
<P>In this cri&s;is, two &s;ets of opinions prevailed, one looked to mea&s;ures which were to have a compul&s;ory effect upon Great-Britain, the &s;eque&s;tration of Briti&s;h debts, and the cutting off intercour&s;e wholly or partially between the two countries: the other to <HI>vigorous preparations</HI> for war, and <HI>one more effort</HI> of negociation, under the &s;olemnity of an extraordinary mi&s;|&s;ion, to avert it.</P>
<P>That the latter was the be&s;t opinion, no truly &s;en&s;ible man can doubt; and it may be boldly affirmed, that the event has entirely ju&s;tified it.</P>
<P>If mea&s;ures of coercion and repri&s;al had taken place, war, in all human probability, would have followed.</P>
<P>National pride is generally a very untractable thing. In the councils of no country does it act with greater force, than in tho&s;e of Great-Britain. Whatever it might have been in her power to yield to negociation, &s;he could have yielded nothing to compul&s;ion, without &s;elf-degradation, and without the &s;a|crifice of that political con&s;equence, which, at all times very important to a nation, was peculiarly &s;o to her at the juncture in que&s;tion. It &s;hould be remembered, too, that from the relations
<PB N="48" REF="028389_0047_0FD8E72412C4EE80">in which the two countries have &s;tood to each other, it mu&s;t have co&s;t more to the pride of Great-Britain to have received the law from us than from any other power.</P>
<P>When one nation has cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t another, the cour&s;e marked out by practice, the opinion of writers, and the principles of humanity, the object being to avoid war, is to precede repri&s;als of any kind, by a demand of reparation. To begin with repri&s;als is to meet on the ground of war, and puts the other party in a condition not to be able to recede without humiliation.</P>
<P>Had this cour&s;e been pur&s;ued by us, it would not only have rendered war morally certain, but it would have united the Bri|ti&s;h nation in the vigorous &s;upport of their government, in the pro&s;ecution of it: while, on our part, we &s;hould have been quickly di&s;tracted and divided. The calamities of war would have brought the mo&s;t ardent to their &s;en&s;es, and placed them among the fir&s;t in reproaching the government with precipita|tion, ra&s;hne&s;s, and folly, for not having taken every chance, by pacific means, to avoid &s;o great an evil.</P>
<P>The example of Denmark and Sweden is cited in &s;upport of the coercive plan. Tho&s;e powers, it is a&s;&s;erted, by arming and acting with vigour, brought Great-Britain to terms.</P>
<P>But who is able to tell us the preci&s;e cour&s;e of this tran&s;|action, or the terms gained by it? Has it appeared that either Denmark or Sweden has obtained as much as we have done&mdash; a &s;tipulation of reparation for the violation of our property, contrary to the laws of war?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what did Denmark and Sweden do? They armed, and they negociated. They did not begin by retaliations and repri&s;als. The United States al&s;o armed and negociated, and, like Denmark and Sweden, prudently forbore repri&s;als. The conduct of the three countries agreed in principle, equally &s;teering clear of a precipitate re&s;ort to repri&s;als, and contra|dicting the doctrines and advice of our war party.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e pur&s;ued by our government was then in coin|cidence with the example of Denmark and Sweden&mdash;and, it may be added, was in every view the wi&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>Few nations can have &s;tronger inducements than the United-States to cultivate peace. Their infant &s;tate in general&mdash;their want of a marine in particular, to protect their commerce, would render war, in an extreme degree, a calamity. It would not only arre&s;t our pre&s;ent rapid progre&s;s to &s;trength and pro&s;|perity, but would probably throw us back into a &s;tate of de|bility
<PB N="49" REF="028389_0048_0FD8E725A5C0C3B0">and impoveri&s;hment, from which it would require years to emerge.</P>
<P>Our trade, navigation, and mercantile capital, would be e&s;|&s;entially de&s;troyed. Spain being an a&s;&s;ociate with Great-Bri|tain, a general Indian war might be expected to de&s;olate the whole extent of our frontier&mdash;our exports ob&s;tructed, agricul|ture would of cour&s;e langui&s;h; all other branches of indu&s;try would proportionably &s;uffer; our public debt in&s;tead of a gra|dual diminution, would &s;u&s;tain a great augmentation, and draw with it a large increa&s;e of taxes and burthens on the people.</P>
<P>But the&s;e evils, however great, were, perhaps, not the wor&s;t to be apprehended. It was to be feared, that the war would be conducted in a &s;pirit which would render it more than or|dinarily calamitous. There are too many proofs, that a con&s;i|derable party among us is deeply infected with tho&s;e horrid principles of jacobini&s;m, which, proceeding from one exce&s;s to another, have made France a theatre of blood, and which, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t vigorous efforts of the national re|pre&s;entation to &s;uppre&s;s it, keeps the de&s;tinies of France, to this moment, &s;u&s;pended by a thread. It was too probable, that the direction of the war, if commenced, would have fallen in|to the hands of men of this de&s;cription. The con&s;equence of this, even in imagination, are &s;uch as to make any virtuous man &s;hudder.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, in a peculiar manner, the duty of the go|vernment to take all po&s;&s;ible chances for avoiding war. The plan adopted was the only one which could claim this advan|tage.</P>
<P>To precipitate nothing, to gain time by negociation, was to leave the country in a &s;ituation to profit by any events which might turn up, tending to re&s;train a &s;pirit of ho&s;tility in Great-Britain, and to di&s;po&s;e her to rea&s;onable accommodation.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of France, which opportunely occurred, allow|ing them to have had an influence upon the i&s;&s;ue, &s;o far from di&s;paraging the merit of the plan that was pur&s;ued, &s;erve to illu&s;trate its wi&s;dom. This was one of the chances which pro|cra&s;tination gave, and one which it was natural to take into the calculation.</P>
<P>Had the rever&s;e been the ca&s;e, the po&s;ture of negociation was &s;till preferable to that of retaliation and repri&s;al; for in this ca&s;e, the triumphs of Great-Britain, the gauntlet hav|ing
<PB N="50" REF="028389_0049_0FD8E72C2EDDC1C8">been thrown by us, would have &s;timulated her to take i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>By taking the ground of negociation in the attitude of pre|paration for war, we at the &s;ame time carried the appeal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the prudence of the Briti&s;h cabinet, without wounding its pride, and to the ju&s;tice and intere&s;t of the Briti&s;h nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without exciting feelings of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>This conduct was calculated to range the public opinion of that country on our &s;ide, to oppo&s;e it to the indulgence of ho&s;|tile views in the cabinet, and, in ca&s;e of war, to lay the foun|dation of &s;chi&s;m and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t important advantages to be expected from the cour&s;e pur&s;ued, was the &s;ecuring of unanimity among our&s;elves, if, after all the pains taken to avoid a war, it had been forced upon us.</P>
<P>As on the one hand, it was certain that di&s;&s;ention and di&s;|content would have embarra&s;&s;ed and enfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bled our exertion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a war produced by any circum&s;tances of intemperance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our public councils, or not endeavoured to be prevented by all the milder expedients u&s;ual in &s;imilar ca&s;es: So, on the other, it was equally certain, that our having ineffectually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|hau&s;ted tho&s;e expedients, would cement us in a firm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> keep us &s;teady and per&s;evering amid&s;t whatever vici&s;&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> might happen, and never our efforts to the utmo&s;t extent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our re&s;ources.</P>
<P>This union among our&s;elves, and di&s;union among our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|mies, were ine&s;timable effects of the moderate plan, if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> promi&s;ed no other advantage.</P>
<P>But to gain time was of va&s;t moment to us in other &s;en&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Not a &s;ea-port of the United States was fortified, &s;o as to protected again&s;t the in&s;ults of a &s;ingle frigate.&mdash;Our ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|zines were, in every re&s;pect, too &s;cantily &s;upplied. It was hight|ly de&s;irable to obviate the&s;e deficiencies before matters ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to extremity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the longer we kept out of war, if obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> into it at la&s;t, the &s;horter would be the duration of the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|mities incident to it.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the injury of which we more imme|diately complain, afforded an additional rea&s;on for precedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> repri&s;als by negociation. The order of the 6th of November, directed neutral ve&s;&s;els to be bro't in for <HI>adjudication.</HI> This was an equivocal phra&s;e; and though there was too much ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;u&s;pect that it was intended to operate as it did, yet th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="51" REF="028389_0050_0FD8E72D15745EE0">was a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;con&s;truction; and that po&s;&s;ibility was a rea&s;on, in the nature of the thing, for giving to the Engli&s;h government an opportunity of explaining before retaliations not place.</P>
<P>To all this it may be added, that one of the &s;ub&s;titutes for the plan pur&s;ued, the &s;eque&s;tration of debts, was a mea&s;ure no le&s;s di&s;hone&s;t than impolitic; as will be &s;hown in the re|marks which will be applied to the 10th article of the treaty.</P>
<P>But is it unimportant to the real friends of republican go|vernment, that the plan pur&s;ued was congenial to the pacific character which is a&s;cribed to it? Would it have been more de&s;irable that the government of our nation, out&s;tripping the war-maxims of Europe, &s;hould, without a previous demand of reparation, have ru&s;hed into repri&s;als, and con&s;equently into a war?</P>
<P>However this may be, it is a well a&s;certained fact, that our country never appeared &s;o augu&s;t and re&s;pectable as in the po|&s;ition which it a&s;&s;umed upon this occa&s;ion.&mdash;Europe was &s;truck with the dignified moderation of our conduct; and the cha|racter of our government and nation acquired a new ele|vation.</P>
<P>It cannot e&s;cape an attentive ob&s;erver, that the language, which, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, condemned the mi&s;&s;ion of an en|voy extraordinary to Great-Britain, and which now condemns the treaty negociated by him, &s;eems to con&s;ider the United States as among the fir&s;t rate powers of the world in point of &s;trength and re&s;ources, and propo&s;es to them a conduct pre|dicated from that condition.</P>
<P>To under-rate our ju&s;t importance, would be a degrading error. To over-rate it, may lead to dangerous mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>A very powerful &s;tate may frequently hazard a high and haughty tone with good policy; but a weak &s;tate can &s;carcely ever do it without imprudence. The la&s;t is yet our character; tho' we are the embryo of a great empire. It is, therefore, bet|ter &s;uited to our &s;ituation to mea&s;ure each &s;tep with the utmo&s;t caution; to hazard as little as po&s;&s;ible, in the ca&s;es in which we are injured; to blend moderation with firmene&s;s; and to brandi&s;h the weapons of ho&s;tility only when it is apparent that the u&s;e of them is unavoidable.</P>
<P>It is not to be inferred from this, that we are to crouch to any power on earth, or tamely to &s;uffer our rights to be vio|lated. A nation which is capable of this meanne&s;s, will quick|ly have no rights to protect, or honour to defend.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="028389_0051_0FD8E730D37DDE40">
But the true inference is, that we ought not lightly to feet or provoke a re&s;ort to arms; that, in the differences between us and other nations, we ought carefully to avoid mea&s;ures which tend to widen the breach; and that we &s;hould &s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|lou&s;ly ab&s;tain from whatever may be con&s;trued into repri&s;als, till after the employment of all amicable means has reduced it to a certainty that there is no alternative.</P>
<P>If we can avoid a war for ten or twelve years more, we &s;hall then have acquired a maturity, which will make it no more than a common calamity, and will authori&s;e us, in our national di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, to take a higher and more impo&s;ing to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>This is a con&s;ideration of the greate&s;t weight to determine us to exert all our prudence and addre&s;s to keep out of we as long as it &s;hall be po&s;&s;ible; to defer, to a &s;tate of manhood a &s;truggle to which infancy is ill adapted.

Upon this, as upon all former oc|ca&s;ions, the good &s;en&s;e of the people mu&s;t be relied upon; and it mu&s;t be taken for granted, that it will be &s;ufficient for their conviction, to give &s;olid an&s;wers to all &s;uch objections as have the &s;emblance of rea&s;on; that now, as heretofore, they will maintain their character abroad and at home, for deliberation and reflection, and di&s;appoint tho&s;e who are in the habit of making experiments upon their credulity, who, treating them as children, fancy that &s;ugar-plumbs and toys will &s;uffice to gain their confidence and attachment, and to lead them blind|fold, whither &s;oever it is de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the treaty, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf under two prin|cipal heads; the permanent articles, which are the fir&s;t ten, and which, with &s;ome &s;upplementary provi&s;ions, adju&s;t the controverted points between the two countries; and the tem|porary articles, which are all the remaining ones, and which e&s;tabli&s;h the principles of mutual intercour&s;e as to GENERAL navigation and commerce. The manner of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will corre&s;pond with this natural divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>An objection meets the treaty at the thre&s;hold. It is &s;aid that our envoy abandoned the ground which our government had uniformly held, and with it our rights and intere&s;ts as a nation, by acceding, in the preamble of the treaty, to the ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of terminating the differences between the two countries, <HI>"it &s;uch a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their re&s;peciti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> complaints and preten&s;ions, may be be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding."</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, in &s;upport of this, that our government ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;tantly charged the fir&s;t breaches of the treaty upon Great-Britain, in the two particulars of carrying away the negroes, and detaining the po&s;ts; that while the evacuation of New-York was going on, a demand of the &s;urrender of the negroes was made by congre&s;s, through our commander in chief, which not being complied with, commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;certain the number carried away, with a view to a claim of compen&s;ation; that early and repeated applications were al&s;o. made for the &s;urrender of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, which not only was not done, but it is proved by the circum&s;tances, that or|ders were not given for it, according to the true intent of the treaty, and that there was, from the beginning, a de&s;ign to in|fract, and a virtual infraction of the article with re&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s this object. All this, it is alleged, has been the uniform lan|guage of our government, and has been demon&s;trated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r. Jeffer&s;on to be true, in his letter to mr. Hammond, of the
<PB N="55" REF="028389_0054_0FD8E73C2CB0B450">29th of May, 1792; and it is a&s;&s;erted, that the ground ought not to have been given up by mr. Jay, becau&s;e it was the &s;tandard of the mutual rights and duties of the parties, as to the points unexecuted of the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>A proper examination of the&s;e matters is therefore called for, not only by the &s;pecific objection which is made to the principle which is contained in the preamble, but by the in|fluence which a right &s;olution is calculated to have, in giving a favourable or unfavourable complexion to the whole plan of the adju&s;tment.</P>
<P>It is true, as &s;ugge&s;ted, that our government has con&s;tantly charged as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain, the two particulars which have been &s;tated; but it is believed to be not true, that it has uniformly charged them as FIRST breaches of the treaty. Individuals may have entertained this idea. The &s;tate of Virginia &s;eems to have proceeded upon it in &s;ome pub|lic acts; but as far as is recollected, that ground was never formally or explicitly taken by the government of the United States in the above-mentioned letter from mr. Jeffer&s;on to mr. Hammond, when, for the fir&s;t time, an attempt was made to vindicate or excu&s;e the whole conduct of this country, in re|gard to the treaty of peace, contrary, I will venture to &s;ay, to the general &s;en&s;e of well-informed men.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;olemn act of our government on this head, is an addre&s;s of congre&s;s to the different &s;tates, of the 13th of April, 1787.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s admits contraventions of the treaty on our part; and in&s;tead of deriving either ju&s;tification or extenuation of them from prior infractions by Great-Britain, urges the dif|ferent &s;tates to a repeal of all contravening laws.</P>
<P>But if the fact, in this re&s;pect, were admitted to be, as &s;tated by the adver&s;aries of the treaty, it would not authori&s;e their conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It would not follow, that, becau&s;e the ground had been taken by the government, it ought to have been pertinaciou&s;ly kept, if, upon fair examination, it had appeared to be not &s;olid, or if an adherence to it would have ob&s;tructed a rea&s;onable adju&s;t|ment of differences.</P>
<P>Nations, no more than individuals, ought to per&s;i&s;t in error, e&s;pecially at the &s;acrifice of their peace and pro&s;perity &mdash;be|&s;ides, nothing is more common, in di&s;putes between nations, than each &s;ide to charge the other with being the aggre&s;&s;or or delinquent.

It has been ob&s;erved, that two breaches of the treaty of peace are charged upon Great-Britain; the carrying away of the Negroes, and the detention of the po&s;ts. It remains to in|ve&s;tigate the reality of the&s;e breaches, and to fix the periods when they can be &s;aid to have happened.</P>
<P>As to the Negroes, the true &s;en&s;e of the article in the treaty of peace, which re&s;pects them, is di&s;puted.</P>
<P>The words of the &s;tipulation are (Art. 7.) that "his Britan|nic maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all convenient &s;peed, and without <HI>cau&s;|ing any de&s;truction</HI> or <HI>carrying away any Negroes</HI> or <HI>other proper|ty of the American</HI> inhabitants withdraw all his armies, gar|ri&s;ons, and fleets, from the United States."</P>
<P>The&s;e terms admit of two con&s;tructions; one, that no Ne|groes, or other articles which <HI>had been</HI> American property, &s;hould be carried away; the other, that the evacuations were to be made, <HI>without depredation;</HI> con&s;equently, that no new de|&s;truction was to be committed, and that: Negroes, or other ar|ticles, which, at the time of the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, <HI>continu|ed to be</HI> the <HI>property</HI> of American inhabitants, unexchanged by the operations of war, &s;hould be forborne to be carried away.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was the con&s;truction which was adopted by this country; and the la&s;t is that in&s;i&s;ted upon by Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The arguments which &s;upport her con&s;truction, are the&s;e:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of war give to an enemy the <HI>u&s;e</HI> and <HI>enjoyment,</HI> during the war, of all <HI>coal</HI> property, of which he obtains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the ab&s;olute owner&s;hip of all <HI>per&s;onal</HI> property which falls into his hands. The latter is called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty:</HI> and, except &s;hips, becomes ve&s;ted in the captors the moment they acquire a firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. With regard to &s;hips, it &s;eems to be a general rule of the marine law, that condemnation is nece&s;&s;ary to complete inve&s;tment of the property in the captor.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Negroes, by the laws of the &s;tates, in which &s;lavery is allowed, are per&s;onal property. They, therefore, on the prin|ciple of tho&s;e laws, like hor&s;es, cattle, and other moveables, were liable to become booty&mdash;and belonged to the enemy, as &s;oon as they came into his hands. Belonging to him, he was free either to apply them to his own u&s;e, or to &s;et them at liberty. If he did the latter, the grant was irrevocable, re&s;|titution was impo&s;&s;ible. Nothing in the laws of nations, or in tho&s;e of Great-Britain, will authori&s;e the re&s;umption of liber|ty, once granted to a human being.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The negroes in que&s;tion were either taken in the cour&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="028389_0857_0FD8EFD81DF7F770">of military operations, or they joined the Briti&s;h army upon invitation by proclamation. However di&s;honourable to Great-Britain the latter may have been, as an illiberal &s;pecies o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> warfare, there is no ground to &s;ay that the &s;trict rules of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did not warrant it; or that the effect was not in the one ca&s;e, as well as in the other, a change of property in the thing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The &s;tipulation relates to "Negroes or <HI>other property</HI> of the <HI>American</HI> inhabitants;" putting Negroes on the &s;ame footing with any other article. The characteri&s;tic of the &s;ub|ject of the &s;tipulation being <HI>property</HI> of <HI>American</HI> inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> whatever had lo&s;t that character could not be the object o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tipulation. But the Negroes in que&s;tion, by the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> war, had lo&s;t that character; they were therefore not within the &s;tipulation.
<P>Why did not the United States demand the &s;urrender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> captured ve&s;&s;els, and of all other moveables, which had falle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the hands of the enemy? The an&s;wer is, becau&s;e com|mon &s;en&s;e would have revolved again&s;t &s;uch a con&s;truc|tion. No one could believe, that an indefinite &s;urrender of al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;poils or booty of a &s;even year's war was ever intended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be &s;tipulated; and yet the demand for a hor&s;e, or an or, or a piece of furniture, would have been as completely within the terms "negroes and other property," as a negro; con&s;e|quently, the rea&s;oning which proves that one is not included excludes the other.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the United States, as to every other articl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is therefore a virtual abandonment of that &s;en&s;e of the &s;tipu|lation which requires the &s;urrender of negroes.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. In the interpretation of treaties, things <HI>odious</HI> or <HI>immor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> are not to be pre&s;umed. The abandonment of Negroes, who had been induced to quit their ma&s;ters, on the faith of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cial proclamation, promi&s;ing them liberty, to fall again un|der the yoke of their ma&s;ters, and into &s;lavery, is as odi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and <HI>immoral</HI> a thing as can be conceived. It is odious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> only as it impo&s;es an act of perfidy on one of the contract|ing parties; but as it tends to bring back to &s;ervitude, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> once made free. The general intere&s;ts of humanity con&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> with the obligation which Great-Britain had contracted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|wards the Negroes, to repel this con&s;truction of the treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> if another can be found.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. But another, and a le&s;s exceptionable con&s;truction i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> found in con&s;idering the clau&s;e as in&s;erted, for greater caution <HI>to &s;ecure evacuations without depredation.</HI> It may be an&s;wered, that this was &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e ho&s;tilities having cea&s;ed,
<PB N="59" REF="028389_0058_0FD8EFD9212296F8">&s;he &s;tipulation to &s;urren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, implied of it&s;elf, that it was to be alone without depredation. But, to this the reply is, that a part of the clau&s;e manife&s;tly contemplates the ca&s;e of new de|predations, and provides a guard again&s;t it, in the promi&s;e, that the evacuations &s;hall be made without <HI>cau&s;ing any de&s;truc|tion.</HI> To cau&s;e de&s;truction is to do &s;ome new act of violence. This reflection de&s;troys the argument drawn from the &s;uper|fluou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tipulation in the &s;en&s;e here given to it, and by &s;howing that it mu&s;t have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in one part, autho|ri&s;es the conclu&s;ion, that the remainder of the clau&s;e has a &s;i|milar &s;en&s;e. The connection of the two things, in parts of one &s;entence, confirms this inference.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e arguments certainly have great weight, and do not admit of ea&s;y refutation. It is a fact, too, that the opinions of &s;ome of the able&s;t lawyers of our own country, have, from the beginning, corre&s;ponded with the con&s;truction they enforce.</P>
<P>It is not enough for us to be per&s;uaded, that &s;ome of the negociators, who made the peace, intended the article in our &s;en&s;e. It is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be found in the in&s;trument it&s;elf, and, from the nature of it, ought to have been expre&s;|&s;ed with clearne&s;s and without ambiguity. If there be real am|biguity in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the effect will incline the &s;cale again&s;t us.</P>
<P>It does not remove the difficulty, to &s;ay, that compen&s;ation for the negroes might have been a &s;ub&s;titute for the thing.&mdash; When one party promi&s;es a &s;pecific thing to another, nothing but the thing it&s;elf will &s;atisfy the promi&s;e. The party to whom it is made cannot be required to accept in lieu of it an equi|valent. It follows, that compen&s;ation for the negroes would not have been a performance of the &s;tipulation to forbear to carry them away; and therefore, if there be any thing odious in the &s;pecific thing it&s;elf, the objection to the interpretation which requires it, is not done away by the idea of &s;ub&s;tituting compen&s;ation. For the article does not admit &s;uch &s;ub&s;titution, and its &s;en&s;e cannot be defined by what it does admit.</P>
<P>Some colour to our &s;en&s;e of the article re&s;ults from the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame clau&s;e, "leaving in all fortifications, the <HI>American</HI> artillery that may be therein."&mdash;But this expre&s;&s;ion is not of equivalent force to that of <HI>property</HI> of <HI>American inhabi|tants.</HI> &mdash;For example &s;uppo&s;e an American &s;hip to have been captured and condemned, it might &s;till be &s;aid of her, in a certain &s;en&s;e, this is an "American &s;hip," alluding to the
<PB N="60" REF="028389_0859_0FD8EFDAA39CCA70">country of which &s;he had been the &s;hip; but it could not be &s;aid in any &s;en&s;e of her, this &s;hip is American <HI>property,</HI> or the <HI>property</HI> of American inhabitants. The country of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thing was, may often be u&s;ed with aptne&s;s as a term of de|&s;cription of that thing, though it may have changed owner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> but the term <HI>property,</HI> which is &s;ynonimous with <HI>owner&s;hip,</HI> can never be u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e as de&s;criptive of an own|er&s;hip, which has cea&s;ed. Moreover, if the expre&s;&s;ions in the two ca&s;es had been (as they are not) of equivalent force, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would not follow that they were to have the &s;ame meaning i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> both ca&s;es, being applied to different matters. For an odious con&s;equence in one in&s;tance, would be a rea&s;on for rejecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a particular &s;en&s;e of a word or phra&s;e, which would be prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in another, to which no &s;uch con&s;equence was attached.</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k this que&s;tion of any candid man. Is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> con&s;truction of the article re&s;pecting the negroes, &s;o much better &s;upported than that of Great-Britain, as to ju&s;tify o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pronouncing with po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tivene&s;s, that the carrying them away was a breach of the treaty?</P>
<P>To me it appears clear, that this mu&s;t be con&s;idered, &s;peak|ing favourably for us, as a very doubtful point, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot with confidence predicate a breach of the treaty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Great-Britain upon this event. If it was one, it happened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> May 1783.</P>
<P>The affair of the we&s;tern po&s;ts is now to be examined; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the detention of them, after the proper point of time for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> livering them up, was a breach of the treaty, will not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> di&s;pute. But what that proper time was, it a &s;erious que&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> between the two parties.</P>
<P>Our government has contended, that the po&s;ts ought to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> been &s;urrendered with all convenient &s;peed, after the provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|al treaty took effect: and mr.

<P>But mr. Jeffer&s;on has not even di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the provi&s;ional or the definitive treaty was the act from whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the obligation to perform was to date. This is an import<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> omi&s;&s;ion; for Great-Britain affirms the definitive treaty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the criterion.</P>
<P>As an original que&s;tion, much might be &s;aid on both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> The natural relation of the terms <HI>provi&s;ional</HI> or <HI>preliminary</HI> and <HI>definitive</HI> &s;eems to exhibit the former as inchoate and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct,
<PB N="61" REF="028389_0860_0FD8EFDC569E0A00">and to refer to the latter the conclu&s;ive obligatory force and legal perfection. There is room, therefore, to &s;ay, that all but the mere ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, or for the execution of which there is no preci&s;e point of time fixed in the prelimi|nary articles, is referred to in the definitive treaty.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it may be argued, that a preliminary treaty is as much a national treaty as a definitive one, both being made by an equal and the competent authority; and that there is no good rea&s;on why tho&s;e things which are &s;uf|ficiently regulated by the preliminary, &s;hould not go into im|mediate and complete effect, equally as if regulated by the definitive treaty; or why the latter &s;hould be con&s;idered as any thing more than an in&s;trument for adju&s;ting points which may have been left open by the preliminary articles, and for giving more perfect form. Accordingly, there are examples of preliminary treaties going into mutual and full execution, though never followed by definitive treaties.</P>
<P>But, however this que&s;tion may have &s;tood on principle, the conduct of our government in the particular ca&s;e has &s;et|tled it again&s;t us, and has completely &s;anctioned the doctrine of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>If performance was to date from the provi&s;ional articles, this applies as well to us to to Great-Britain. It was incum|bent upon congre&s;s to have notified the treaty, with the pro|per &s;olemnities, to the different &s;tates and their citizens; to have made the recommendations &s;tipulated by the fifth arti|cle; and to have enjoined the ob&s;ervance of all tho&s;e things which we promi&s;ed on our part. The nature of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tipulations rendered it particularly urgent that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t. But all was deferred till the ratification in this coun|try of the definitive treaty. The 15th of January 1784, is the date of the act which attempts to carry the treaty into effect on our part. This then is a practical &s;ettlement by our|&s;elves of the principle, that performance was to date from the definitive treaty.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the po&s;ition, that our &s;ea ports were previou&s;ly evacuated; that was matter of mutual convenience; and though done, does not change the &s;tate of <HI>&s;trict obligation</HI> between the parties. Even in the view of liberal and concilia|ting procedure, the prompt &s;urrender of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a ports are, for obvious rea&s;ons, very different things.</P>
<P>But our dilemma is this, if the delay of orders for evacuating the we&s;tern po&s;ts, previous to the ratification of the definitive treaty, was, on the part of Great-Britain, a breach of treaty,

<P>AN accurate enumeration of the breaches of the treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of peace on our part, would require a tedious re|&s;earch. It will &s;uffice to &s;elect and quote a few of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prominent and early in&s;tances.</P>
<P>One of the earlie&s;t is to be found in an act of this &s;tate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|granting a more effectual relief in ca&s;es of certain tre&s;pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pa&s;&s;ed the 17th March, 1783.

To this it may be added that it was con&s;ider|ed by Great-Britain as a direct infraction of the 6th article of her treaty with us, which exempts all per&s;ons from pro&s;ecution "by rea&s;on of the part they might have taken in the war."</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on, not controverting the point that the provi&s;ions of this act were contrary to the treaty, endeavours to get rid of the inference from it, by alleging three things.&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. That it pa&s;&s;ed antecedently to the treaty, and &s;o could not be a violation of an act of &s;ub&s;equent data.&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. That the treaty was para|mount to the laws of the particular &s;tates, and operated a re|peal of them.&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. That the exceptionable principle of this act was never &s;anctioned by the courts of ju&s;tice, and in one in&s;tance (the ca&s;e of Rutgers and Waddington in the mayor's court) was over ruled.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point, it is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that the law continued to operate, <HI>in fact,</HI> from the time of the treaty rid the 4th of April, 1787, when there was a repeal of the exception|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble clau&s;e, by an act of our legi&s;lature. During the period of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our years, many &s;uits were brought and many recoveries had; extending even to per&s;ons who had been in the military <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rvice of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd point, the&s;e ob&s;ervations may be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The articles of the confederation did not, like our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, declare that treaties were <HI>&s;upreme laws</HI> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and. The United States, under that &s;y&s;tem, had no courts of their own, to expound and enforce their treaties as laws. All was to depend upon the comparative authority of laws and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eaties, in the judgment of the &s;tate courts.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, whether treaties were paramount to, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rtual repeal of antecedent laws, was a que&s;tion of theory, about which there was room for, and in this country did exi&s;t much diver&s;ity of opinion. It is notorious, that it has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">renuou&s;ly maintained that however a national treaty ought, a good faith, to be conclu&s;ive on a &s;tate, to induce a repeal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws contrary to it; yet its actual laws could not be contro|verted by treaty, without an actual repeal by its own authority. This doctrine has been emphatically that of the party di&s;tin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&s;hed by its oppo&s;ition to national principles.</P>
<P>And it is ob&s;ervable, that congre&s;s, not relying entirely up
<PB N="64" REF="028389_0063_0FD8E757695B3C08">on the force of the treaty, to abrogate contravening laws, in their addre&s;s already cited, urge the &s;tates to a repeal of tho&s;e laws. It is likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable in re&s;pect to the very act under con&s;ideration, that the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, in April, 1787, thought a po&s;itive repeal of the exceptionable clau&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>The complaints of a power, who&s;e treaty with us was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>fact,</HI> violated by the operation of a &s;tate law, could never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered by referring to a <HI>theoretic, ab&s;tract, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">puted</HI> propo&s;ition.

<P>As to the third point, it is to be ob&s;erved, that though th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> may have been no expre&s;s formal deci&s;ion of our courts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forcing the exceptionable principle of the tre&s;pa&s;s act: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there never was a deci&s;ion of a &s;upreme court again&s;t it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it may not be ami&s;s to remark incidentally, that the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of the mayor's court, from which mr.

The truth on this point is, that according to the opini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> our bar, a defence under a military order was de&s;perate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it was believed that a majority of our &s;upreme court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would over-rule the plea.

<PB N="65" REF="028389_0064_0FD8E75A8A765C28">is it po&s;&s;ible to doubt, that the act in que&s;tion operated a breach of our treaty with Great-Britain? and this from the commencement of its exi&s;tence? can we rea&s;onably expect, that nations with whom we have treaties, will allow us to &s;ub|&s;titute theoretic problems to performances of our engage|ments, and will be willing to accept them as apologies for actual violations?</P>
<P>It is pertinent to remark, that the Briti&s;h commander in chief very early remon&s;trated again&s;t this act; but the remon|&s;trance produced no effect.</P>
<P>Another act of the &s;tate of New-York may be cited as a violation of the treaty on our part, which mu&s;t have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">early cotemporary with that of the detention of the po&s;ts.

<P>This was, in &s;ub&s;tance, a new confi&s;cation; judgments which from error were invalid, were nullities.

<P>Another, and an unequivocal breach of the treaty, is found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> act of South-Carolina, of March 26, 1784.

<P>It is idle to attempt to excu&s;e infractions of this kind, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">pleas of di&s;tre&s;s and inability.

<P>But the ca&s;e of Virginia is &s;till &s;tronger than that of South Carolina.

With what truth has it been a&s;&s;erted, that "it was at all times <HI>perfectly under&s;tood</HI>" that treaties controuled the laws of the &s;tates?</P>
<P>Additional proof of the contrary is found in the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, the &s;tate pa&s;&s;ed an act repealing all &s;uch acts or parts of acts of the late, as had prevented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this provi&s;o, that there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the repeal, 'till the governor, by advice of council had, by proclamation, notified that Great-Britain had delivered up the po&s;ts, and was taking mea&s;ures for the further fulfilment of the treaty by delivering up the Negroes, or by making compen&s;ation for them. This denotes clearly, that in the opi|nion of the legi&s;lature of Virginia, there were acts of that &s;tate which <HI>had prevented</HI> and <HI>might prevent</HI> the recovery of debts according to the treaty.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, too, that the re&s;olutions of June, 1784, do not even give the expectation of a complete repeal of the im|peding laws, in the event of reparation of the breaches of treaty by Great-Britain.

<P>I pa&s;s by the &s;erious contraventions of the treaty in this important article of the debts, which are of a later date, becau&s;e they do not affect the que&s;tion of the fir&s;t breach, though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of great weight to demon&s;trate the obligation of the Uni|ted States to make conpen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The argument then, upon the whole, as to the que&s;tion of the fir&s;t breach, &s;tands thus&mdash;It is a great doubt whether the
<PB N="68" REF="028389_0067_0FD8E7648E7B8CD0">carring away of the negroes was at all a breach.

The ta&s;k of di&s;playing this truth has been an unwelcome one. As long as a contrary doctrine was either a mere e&s;&s;ay of polemical &s;kill, or a convenient ingredient of negociation, it was natural for tho&s;e who thought differently of it, to prefer &s;ilence to con|tradiction; but when it is made the engine of great errors, of national conduct, of exce&s;&s;ive preten&s;ions, which forbid a rea|&s;onable accommodation, of national difference, and endangers rupture and war, on grounds which rea&s;on di&s;approves and prudence condemns, it becomes an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to ex|po&s;e its hollowne&s;s and fallacy.&mdash;Re&s;erve then would be a crime.

<PB N="70" REF="028389_0069_0FD8E76AA03C3280">of this independent country, is an object of &s;uch GREAT and PRIMARY magnitude, that it ought not to be relinqui&s;hed, un|le&s;s the relinqui&s;hment be clearly nece&s;&s;ary to PRESERVE our HONOUR in &s;ome UNEQUIVOCAL point, or to avoid the &s;acrifice of &s;ome RIGHT or INTEREST of MATERIAL and PERMANENT importance." This is the touch&s;tone of every que&s;tion which can come before us, re&s;pecting our foreign concerns.</P>
<P>As a general propo&s;ition, &s;carcely any will di&s;pute it; but in the application of the rule, there is much confu&s;ion of ideas; much fal&s;e feeling and fal&s;er rea&s;oning. The ravings of anger and pride are mi&s;taken for the &s;ugge&s;tions of honor. Thus are we told in a delirium of rage, by a gentleman of South-Carolina, that our envoy &s;hould have demanded an <HI>un|conditional</HI> relinqui&s;hment of the we&s;tern po&s;ts as a right; till which was granted, and until lord Grenville had given orders to lord Dorche&s;ter to that effect, <HI>open to be &s;ent to our pre&s;ident, to be by him forwarded,</HI> he &s;hould not have <HI>opened his lips about the treaty.

<P>In a ca&s;e of inconte&s;tible, <HI>mutual</HI> infractions of a treaty, one of the parties is to demand, peremptorily of the other, an <HI>unconditional</HI> performance upon his part, by way of pre|liminary and without negociation. An envoy &s;ent to avert war, carrying with him the cleare&s;t indications of a general &s;olicitude of his country, that peace might be pre&s;erved, was, at the very fir&s;t &s;tep of his progre&s;s, to render ho&s;tility inevi|table, by exacting, not only what could not have been com|plied with, but what mu&s;t have been rejected with indig|nation. The government of Great-Britain mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t abject on earth, in a ca&s;e &s;o &s;ituated, to have li&s;tened for a moment to &s;uch a demand. And becau&s;e our envoy did not pur&s;ue this frantic cour&s;e; did not hold the language of an IMPERIOUS BASHAW to his TREMBLING SLAVE, he is ab&s;urdly &s;tigmati&s;ed as having <HI>pro&s;trated the rights of freemen, at the foot of royalty.</HI> What are we to think of the &s;tate of mind which could produce &s;o extravagant a &s;ally? would a prudent people have been willing to have entru&s;ted a nego|ciation which involved their peace to the author of it? will they be willing to take him as their guide in a critical emer|gency of their affairs?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No man in the habit of thinking well, either of mr.

<P><PB N="71" REF="028389_0070_0FD8E76CCBDD1430">
True honor is a rational thing. It is as di&s;tingui&s;hable from Quixoti&s;m, as true courage from the &s;pirit of bravo. It is po&s;&s;ible for one nation to commit &s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed and unqua|lified an outrage upon another, as to render a negociation of the que&s;tion di&s;honorable. But this &s;eldom, if ever happens. In mo&s;t ca&s;es, it is con&s;i&s;tent with honor to precede rupture by negociation, and whenever it is, rea&s;on and humanity de|mand it. Honor cannot be wounded by con&s;ulting modera|tion. As a general rule, it is not till after it has become ma|nife&s;t, that rea&s;onable reparation for a clear premediated wrong cannot be obtained by an amicable adju&s;tment, that honor demands a re&s;ort to arms. In all the que&s;tions between us and Great-Britain, honor permitted the moderate cour&s;e; in tho&s;e which regard the inexecution of the treaty of peace, there had undoubtedly been mutual faults.&mdash;It was, there|fore, a ca&s;e for negociation and mutual reparation. True ho|nor, which can never be &s;eparated from ju&s;tice, even requires reparation from us to Great-Britain, as well as from her to us. The injuries we complain of in the pre&s;ent war, were al&s;o of a negociable kind. The fir&s;t was bottomed on a controverted point in the laws of nations. The &s;econd left open the que&s;tion, whether the principal injury was a de&s;igned act of the govern|ment or a mi&s;con&s;truction of its courts. To have taken, there|fore, the imperious ground which is recommended, in place of that which was taken&mdash;would have been not to follow the admonitions of honor, but to have &s;ubmitted to the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and phrenzy.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, when it is a&s;&s;erted that war is preferable to the &s;acrifice of our rights and intere&s;ts, this, to be true, to be ra|tional, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of &s;uch rights and intere&s;ts as are certain, as are important, &s;uch as regard the honor, &s;ecurity, or pro&s;perity of our country. It is not a right di&s;putable, or of &s;mall con&s;equence, it is not an intere&s;t temporary, par|tial and incon&s;iderable, which will ju&s;tify, in our &s;ituation, an appeal to arms.</P>
<P>Nations ought to calculate as well as individuals; to com|pare evils; and to prefer the le&s;&s;er to the greater; to act otherwi&s;e, is to act unrea&s;onably; tho&s;e who coun&s;el it, are impo&s;tors or madmen.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are of a nature to lead to a right judgment of the conduct of our envoy in the plan of adju&s;tment to which he has given his a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Three objects, as has appeared, were to be aimed at, on be|half
<PB N="72" REF="028389_0071_0FD8E76E5EE20D38">of the United States. 1&s;t, Compen&s;ation for Negroes car|ried away. 2d, Surrender of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts. 3d, Compen|&s;ation for &s;poliation during the exi&s;ting war.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e objects, and the&s;e in every view the mo&s;t im|portant, have been provided for; how fully will be examined hereafter. One of them has been given up (to wit) compen|&s;ation for the Negroes.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hown, as I tru&s;t, to the conviction of di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate men, that the claim of compen&s;ation for the Ne|groes, is, in point of right, a very doubtful one; in point of intere&s;t, it certainly falls under the de&s;cription of partial and incon&s;iderable; affecting in no re&s;pect, the honor or &s;ecurity of the nation, and incapable of having a &s;en&s;ible influence up|on its pro&s;perity. The pecuniary value of the object is, in a national &s;cale, trifling,</P>
<P>Not having before me the proper documents, I can only &s;peak from memory. But I do not fear to be materially mi&s;|taken in &s;tating that the whole number carried away, &s;o a&s;cer|tained as to have afforded evidence for a claim of compen&s;a|tion, was &s;hort of 3000 per&s;ons, of whom about 1300 were of &s;ixteen years and upwards, men, women, and children. Com|puting the&s;e at an average of 150 dollars per head, which is a competent price, the amount would be 450, 000 dollars, and not two or three millions, as has been pretended.</P>
<P>It is a fact, which I a&s;&s;ert on the be&s;t authority, that our en|voy made every effort in this power to e&s;tabli&s;h our con&s;tructi|on of the article relating to this &s;ubject, and to obtain compen|&s;ation; and that he did not relinqui&s;h it, till he became con|vinced, that to in&s;i&s;t upon it would defeat the purpo&s;e of his mi&s;&s;ion, and leave the controver&s;y between the two countries un&s;ettled.</P>
<P>Finding, at the &s;ame time, that the two other points in di&s;|pute could be rea&s;onably adju&s;ted, is there any one who will be ra&s;h enough to affirm, that he ought to have broken off the negociation on account of the difficulty about the Negroes? Yes! there are men, who are thus incon&s;iderate and intempe|rate! But will a &s;ober reflecting people ratify their &s;entence?</P>

<P>WHAT would &s;uch a people have &s;aid to our envoy, had he returned with this ab&s;urd tale in his mouth! "Countrymen! I could have obtained the &s;urrende of your po&s;ts, and an adequate provi&s;ion for the reparation of your lo&s;&s;es by unju&s;t captures&mdash;I could have terminated your con|trover&s;y with Great Britain, and &s;ecured the continuance of your peace, but for one ob&s;tacle, a refu&s;al to compen&s;ate for the negroes carried away; on this point the Briti&s;h govern|ment maintained a con&s;truction of the treaty different from ours, and adhered to it with inflexibility. I confe&s;s, that there appeared to be much doubt concerning the true con&s;truction: I confe&s;s, al&s;o, that the object was of incon&s;iderable value. Yet it made a part of our claims; and I thought the hazards of war preferable to a renunciation of it."</P>
<P>What would his adver&s;aries have replied to him on &s;uch an occa&s;ion? No ridicule would have been too &s;trong, no reproach too bitter. Their triumph would have been complete: for he would have been de&s;ervedly left without advocate, without apologi&s;t.</P>
<P>It cannot admit of a &s;erious doubt, that the affair of the negroes, was too que&s;tionable in point of right, too in&s;ignificant in point of intere&s;t, to have been &s;uffered to be an impediment to the immen&s;e objects which were to be promoted by an ac|commodation of differences acceptable in other re&s;pects. There was no general principle of national right or policy to be re|nounced. No con&s;ideration of honor forbid the renunciation, every calculation of intere&s;t invited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the advantage, if at the end of it there was a certainty of attainment.</P>
<P>But was war the alternative? Yes, war or di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The United States and Great Britain had been brought to i&s;&s;ue. The recent &s;poliations on our commerce, &s;uperadded to the evils of a protracted Indian war, connected with the de|tention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and accompanied with indications of a de&s;ign to contract our boundaries, ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of our &s;ettlements and the enjoyment of private rights, and producing &s;erious and growing di&s;content in our we&s;tern country, rendered it indi&s;pen&s;able, that there &s;hould be a &s;et|tlement
<PB N="76" REF="028389_0075_0FD8E7774E425460">of old differences, and a reparation of new wrongs; or, that the &s;word &s;hould vindicate our rights.</P>
<P>This was certainly, and with rea&s;on, the general &s;en&s;e of our country, when our envoy left it. There are many indications that it was the opinion of our government; and it is to be in|ferred, that our envoy under&s;tood the alternative to be as has been &s;tated.</P>
<P>Indeed what el&s;e could be contemplated? after the depreda|tions which had been committed upon our commerce, after the &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility which had been di&s;covered upon the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ca&s;ion in and out of our public councils, after an envoy extra|ordinary had been &s;ent to terminate differences and obtain re|paration; if nothing had re&s;ulted, was there any choice but repri&s;als? &s;hould we not have rendered our&s;elves ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of the whole world, by forbearing them?</P>
<P>It is curious to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;erve the incon&s;i&s;tency of certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

So un&s;ettled a &s;tate of things would have led to fre&s;h injuries and aggravations; and circum&s;tamo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, would have dragged us into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> We &s;hould have lo&s;t our honor without pre&s;erving our pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Nations in &s;imilar &s;ituations have no option but to accom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> date differences, or to fight.

<P>Even a &s;tile of politene&s;s in our envoy has been con&s;trued to his di&s;advantage.

<P>Suppo&s;itions that more could be done by di&s;playing, what is called, greater &s;pirit, are not warranted by facts. It would be extremely imprudent on that ba&s;is, to tru&s;t our&s;elves to a &s;ur|ther experiment&mdash;to the immen&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes in the affairs of Europe, which from moment to moment may e&s;&s;entially vary the relative &s;ituations of the contending parties. If there ever was a &s;tate of things which demanded extraordinary circum|&s;pection, and forbade a &s;pirit of adventure, it is that of the United States at the exi&s;ting juncture, viewed in connection with the pre&s;ent very &s;ingular and incalculable po&s;ture of Eu|rope.</P>

This being the ca&s;e, no cau&s;e of umbrage is given to France by the treaty, and is as contrary to her intere&s;t as to in|clination, wantonly to &s;eek a quarrel with us.

<P>THERE is one more objection to the treaty for what it does not do, which requires to be noticed. This is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> omi&s;&s;ion to provide again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen.</P>
<P>It is certain that our trade has &s;uffered embarra&s;&s;ments in this re&s;pect, and that there have been abu&s;es which have operated very oppre&s;&s;ively upon our &s;eamen; and all will join in the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that they could have been guarded again&s;t in future by the treaty.</P>
<P>But it is ea&s;ier to de&s;ire this, than to &s;ee how it could have been done. A general &s;tipulation again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen would have been nugatory, if not derogatory. Our right to an exemption is perfect by the laws of nations, and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great Britain. The difficulty has been, and is, to fix a rule of evidence, by which to di&s;criminate our &s;eamen from theirs, and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> crimination to give ours protection, without covering theirs in our &s;ervice. It happens that the two nations &s;peak the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame language, and in every exterior circum&s;tance clo&s;ely re&s;emble each other; that many of the natives of Great Britain and Ireland are among our citizens, and that others, without being properly our citizens, are employed in our ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Every body knows, that the &s;afety of Great Britain depends upon her marine. This was never more emphatically the cafe, than in the war in which &s;he is now engaged. Her very e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|i&s;tence as an independent power, &s;eems to re&s;t on a maritime &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, can we be &s;urpri&s;ed that there are difficul|ties in bringing her to con&s;ent to any arrangement which would enable us, by receiving her &s;eamen into our em|ployment, to detain them from her &s;ervice? Unfortunateds; there can be devi&s;ed no method of protecting our &s;eamen which does not involve that danger to her. Language and appear|ance, in&s;tead of being a guide, as between other nations, are
<PB N="79" REF="028389_0078_0FD8E77BD724C248">between us and Great Britain, &s;ources of mi&s;take and decep|tion. The mo&s;t familiar experience in the ordinary affairs of &s;ociety, proves, that the oaths of parties intere&s;ted cannot be fully relied upon. Certificates of citizen&s;hip, by officers of one party, would be too open to the po&s;&s;ibility of collu&s;ion and im|po&s;ition, to expect that the other would admit them to be con|clu&s;ive. If inconclu&s;ive, there mu&s;t be a di&s;cretion to the other party which would de&s;troy their efficacy.</P>
<P>In whatever light they may be viewed, there will be found an intrin&s;ic difficulty in devi&s;ing a rule of evidence, &s;a&s;e for both parties, and con&s;equently, in e&s;tabli&s;hing one by treaty. No nation would readily admit a rule which would make it depend on the good faith of another, and the integrity of its agents, whether her &s;eamen, in time of war, might be drawn from her &s;ervice, and transferred to that of a neutral power. Such a rule between Great Britain and us, would be peculiarly dan|gerous, on account of circum&s;tances, and would facilitate a transfer of &s;eamen from one party to another. Great Britain has accordingly per&s;everingly declined any definitive arrange|ment on the &s;ubject; notwith&s;tanding earne&s;t and reiterated efforts of our government.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider candidly the peculiar difficulties which various circum&s;tances of &s;imilitude, between the people of the two countries, oppo&s;e to a &s;atisfactory arrangement, and that to the belligerent party, it is a que&s;tion of <HI>national &s;afety,</HI> to the neutral party a que&s;tion of commercial convenience and individual &s;ecurity, we &s;hall be the le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to think the want of &s;uch a provi&s;ion as our wi&s;hes would dictate, a blemi&s;h in the treaty.</P>
<P>The truth &s;eems to be, that from the nature of the thing, it is matter of nece&s;&s;ity to leave it to occa&s;ional and temporary expedients&mdash;to the effects of &s;pecial interpo&s;itions from time to time, to procure the correction of abu&s;es; and if the abu&s;e becomes intolerable, to the <HI>ultima ratio;</HI> the good faith of the parties, and the motives which they have to re&s;pect the rights of each other, and to avoid cau&s;es of offence, and vigilance in noting and remon&s;trating again&s;t the irregularities which are committed, are probably the only peaceable &s;ureties of which the ca&s;e is &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>Our mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has &s;trenuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf to have it placed upon &s;ome acceptable &s;ooting; but his endeavours have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, further than to mi|tigate the evil by &s;ome additional checks, and by drawing the attention of the Briti&s;h government to the ob&s;ervance of more
<PB N="80" REF="028389_0079_0FD8E77D9ABD65E0">caution. A more &s;en&s;ible effect of our repre&s;entations has been lately experienced; and with attention and vigilance, that effect may be continued, and perhaps increa&s;ed. But there is rea&s;on to &s;ear that it would con&s;tantly be found impracticable to e&s;tabli&s;h an efficacious conventional guard.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the examination of the &s;everal articles in the treaty, in the order in which they &s;tand.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t contains merely a general declaration that there &s;hall be peace and friendihip between the contracting parties, the countries and people of each, without exception of per&s;ons or places.</P>
<P>One would have imagined that this article, at lea&s;t, would have e&s;caped a formal objection; however it might have been &s;ecretly viewed as the mo&s;t &s;inful of all, by tho&s;e who pant after war and enmity between the two countries. Nothing but the fact could have led to a farmi&s;e that it was po&s;&s;ible for it to have been deemed exceptionable, and nothing can better di&s;play the rage for objection, which actuates the adver&s;aries of the treaty, than their having invented one again&s;t &s;o inno|cent a provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the committeee appointed by a meeting at Charle&s;ton, (South Carolina) hare &s;agaciou&s;ly di&s;covered, that this article permits "the unconditional return to our country of all per&s;ons who were pro&s;cribed during the late war."</P>
<P>With all but men determined to be di&s;&s;atis&s;ied, it would be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to &s;uch an objection to &s;ay, that this article is a formula in almo&s;t every treaty on record, and that the con|&s;equence attributed to it was never before dreamt of, though other nations be&s;ides our&s;elves have had their pro&s;criptions and their bani&s;hments.</P>
<P>But this is not all&mdash;our treaty of peace with Great Britain in 1783, has an equivalent &s;lipulation in the&s;e words (article 6) "there &s;hall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britan|nic maje&s;ty and the &s;aid &s;tates, and between the &s;ubjects of the one, and the citizens of the other." In calling this an equiva|lent &s;tipulation, I &s;peak with reference to the objection which is made. The argument to &s;upport that objection would be to this effect; "Exiles and criminals are regarded as within the peace of a country; but the people of each are, by this article, placed within the peace of the other; therefore pro&s;cribed per|&s;ons are re&s;tored to the peace of the United States, and &s;o lo&s;e the character of exiles and criminals." Hence the argument will turn upon the word "peace"&mdash;the word "friend&s;hip" will have no influence upon the que&s;tion. In other re&s;pects there is no difference, in &s;ub&s;tance, between the two articles. For the
<PB N="81" REF="028389_0080_0FD8E7819E906EB0">terms "people," "&s;ubjects," "citizens," as u&s;ed in the two treaties, are &s;ynonimous. If, therefore, the la&s;t treaty &s;tipulates that there &s;hall be peace between the governments, countries, and people of the two nations, the fir&s;t &s;tipulates what is equi|valent, that there &s;hall be peace between the two governments, and the &s;ubjects and citizens of each. The additional words, without exception of per&s;ons and places, can make no differ|ence, being merely &s;urplu&s;age If A &s;ays to B, "I will give you all the money in this pur&s;e," the gi&s;t is as complete as if he had &s;aid, "I give you all the money in this pur&s;e, without exception of a &s;ingle dollar."</P>
<P>But the object of the &s;tipulation, and the &s;ubject of the ob|jection, have no relation to each other.&mdash;National &s;tipulations are to be con&s;idered in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations. Peace, in the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e laws, defines a &s;tate which is oppo&s;ite to WAR. Peace, in the &s;en&s;e of the municipal laws, defines a &s;tate which is oppo&s;ite to that of crimm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity. They are, con&s;e|quently, different things; and a &s;ubject of Great Britain, by committing a crime, may put him&s;elf out of the peace of our government, in the &s;en&s;e of our municipal laws, while there might be perfect peace with him, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> there might be war with him, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations, and peace in that of the munici|pal laws.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of a &s;ubject of Great Britain as a felon, would certainly not con&s;titute a &s;tate of war between the par|ties, nor interfere with the peace which is &s;tipulated by this article; though it is declared that it &s;hall <HI>be inviolable,</HI> and might as well be affirmed to prevent the puni&s;hment of future, as of former criminals.</P>
<P>But who, in the contemplation of the laws of the re&s;pective &s;tates, are the pro&s;cribed per&s;ons? they mu&s;t have been under|&s;tood to have been &s;ubjects or citizens of the &s;tates which pro|&s;cribed them&mdash;con&s;equently cannot be pre&s;umed to be compre|hended in an article which &s;lipulates peace between the nations and their re&s;pective citizens.</P>
<P>This is not a &s;tipulation of peace between a nation and its own citizens; nor can the idea of expatriation be admitted to go &s;o far as to de&s;troy the relation of citizen, as regards ame|nability for a crime. To this purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t, the offender mu&s;t remain a citizen.</P>
<P>There can hardly have been a time when a treaty was form|ed between two nations, when one or the other had not ex|iled criminals or &s;ugutives from ju&s;tice, which it would have been unwilling to remilate. Yet this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cemed an ob|&s;tacle

<P>It follows that the objection which has been taken to this article is wholly without foundation.

<P>This article, which accompli&s;hes a primary object of our envoy's mi&s;&s;ion, and one of primary importance to the United States, has been as much clamoured again&s;t as if it had made a formal ce&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts to Great Britain. On this point an uncommon degree of art has been exerted, and with no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s. The value of the principal thing obtained has been put out of &s;ight by a mi&s;repre&s;entation of incidental cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But the fact is, neverthele&s;s, that an object has been accom|pli&s;hed, of va&s;t con&s;equence to our country. The mo&s;t im|portant <HI>de&s;iderata</HI> in our concerns with foreign powers are, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and a participation in the na|vigation of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. More or fewer of commercial privileges are of va&s;tly inferior moment. The force of circum|&s;tances will do all we can rea&s;onably wi&s;h in this re&s;pect; and, in a &s;hort time, without any &s;teps that may convul&s;e our trade or endanger our tranquillity, will carry us to our goal.</P>
<P>The recovery of the we&s;tern po&s;ts will have many important con&s;equences. It will extingui&s;h a &s;ource of controver&s;y with Great Britain, which, at a period, not di&s;tant, mu&s;t have inevita|bly involved the two countries in a war, and the thing was be|coming every day, more and more urgent. It will enable us effec|tually to controul the ho&s;tilities of the northern and we&s;tern Indians, and in &s;o doing will have a material influence on the &s;outhern tribes. It will therefore tend to re&s;cue the country from what is at pre&s;ent its greate&s;t &s;courge, Indian wars. When we con&s;ider that the&s;e wars have, four years pa&s;t, taken an extra million annually from our revenue, we cannot be in|&s;en&s;ible of the importance of terminating that &s;ource of ex|pen&s;e. This million turned to the redemption of our debt, would contribute to complete its extinqui&s;hment in about twen|ty years.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a rough calculation, but it cannot materially err.</NOTE> The benefits of tranquillity to our frontier, exempt|ing its inhabitants from the complieated horrors of &s;avage war|fare,

<P>The advantages of the recovery of the po&s;ts do not &s;top here; an exten&s;ion of trade is to be added to the catalogue. This, however, need only be mentioned at this time, as it will come again into view in con&s;idering the third article.</P>
<P>But two con&s;equences, not commonly adverted to, require particular notice in this place.</P>
<P>There is ju&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion, corroborated by various concurring circum&s;tances, that Great Britain has entertained the project of contracting our boundaries to the Ohio. This has appeared in Canada&mdash;at the Briti&s;h garri&s;ons&mdash;at the Indian towns&mdash;at Philadelphia, and at London. The &s;urrender of the po&s;ts for ever cuts up by the roots, this pernicious project. The whole of our we&s;tern intere&s;ts are immediately and deeply con|cerned in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The harmonious and permanent connection of our we&s;ten with our Atlantic country, materially depends on our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. Already had great di&s;content been engen|dered in that country by their detention. That di&s;content was increa&s;ing and rankling daily. It was actually one of the ali|ments of the in&s;urrection in the we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. While the po&s;ts remained in the hands of Great Britain, dan|gerous tamperings with the inhabitants of that country were to be apprehended&mdash;a community of views between Great Britain and Spain might have taken place, and by force and &s;edition, events formidable to our general union might have been hazarded. The di&s;po&s;ition or prevention of that commu|nity of views, is a point of the greate&s;t moment in our &s;y&s;tem of national policy. It pre&s;&s;es us to terminate differences, and extingui&s;h mi&s;onder&s;tandings with Great Britain;&mdash;it urges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to improve the favorable moment, and &s;tamps with the charge of madne&s;s, the efforts to let go the hold which the treaty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mutually ratified, would give us.</P>
<P>Whoever will ca&s;t his eye upon the map of the United States, will &s;urvey the po&s;ition of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, their re|lations to our we&s;tern waters, and their general bearings upon our we&s;tern country; and is at the &s;ame time capable of mak|ing the re&s;lections, which an accurate view of the &s;ubject &s;ug|ge&s;ts, will di&s;cover multiplied confirmations of the po&s;ition, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e po&s;ts by us, has an intimate connec|tion with the pre&s;ervation of union between our we&s;tern and Atlantic territories; and whoever can appreciate the immen&s;e mi&s;chiefs of a di&s;union, will feel the prodigious value of the acqua&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;uch a man, the que&s;tion may be confidently

<P>But it is &s;aid by way of objection, that admitting the po&s;ts will be &s;urrendered at the time &s;tipulated, it is no acqui&s;ition by this treaty: it is only the enjoyment of a right which was &s;ecured by the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>With as much good &s;en&s;e might it be &s;aid, that the &s;tipula|tion of reparation for the &s;poliation of our property, or even immediate actual reparation, if it had been obtained, was no|thing gained; becau&s;e the laws of nations gave us a right to &s;uch reparation; and it might in this way be proved to have been impo&s;&s;ible for our envoy to have effected any thing u&s;eful or meritorious.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee what is the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Great Britain had engaged by the treaty of peace, to &s;urrender the we&s;tern po&s;ts <HI>with all convenient &s;peed;</HI> but without fixing a preci&s;e time. For the cau&s;e, or on the pretext of our not having complied with the treaty on our part, e&s;pecially in not removing the im|pediments which the antecedent laws of particular &s;tates, op|po&s;ed to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, &s;he delayed, and after|wards refu&s;ed to make the &s;urrender; and when our envoy left this country, there was too much appearance of an intention on her part, to detain them indefinitely, and this after having actually kept them ten years. The treaty of peace was con&s;e|quently in this particular &s;u&s;pended, if not &s;uper&s;eded. It was either to be rein&s;tated by a new agreement, or enforced by arms. The fir&s;t our envoy has effected; he has brought Great Britain to abandon the di&s;pute, and to fix a preci&s;e, determinate time when, at furthe&s;t, the po&s;ts are to be delivered up. It is therefore to this new agreement, that we &s;hall owe the enjoy|ment of them, and it is of cour&s;e, entitled to the merit of hav|ing obtained them; it is a po&s;itive ingredient in its value, which cannot be taken from it; and it may be added, that this is the fir&s;t time that the merit of procuring, by negociation, <HI>re&s;titution</HI> of a <HI>right withheld,</HI> was ever denied to the in&s;trument which procured it.</P>
<P>But the picture given of the &s;ituation of Great Britain, to warrant the inferences which are drawn, is exaggerated and fal&s;e. It cannot be denied that &s;he is triumphant on the ocean; that the acqui&s;itions which &s;he has made upon France, are hitherto greater than tho&s;e which France has made upon her. If, on the one hand, &s;he owes an immen&s;e debt, on the other &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in immen&s;e credit, which there is no &s;ymptom of being i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">paited.&mdash;Briti&s;h credit has become, in a Briti&s;h mind,
<PB N="86" REF="028389_0085_0FD8E78D437A2EB8">an article of faith, and is no longer an object of rea&s;on. How long it may la&s;t, how far it may go, is incalculable. But it is evident, that it &s;till affords prodigious re&s;ources, and that it is likely for &s;ome time to come, to continue to afford them.

Her manufactures, though probably wound|ed by the war, are &s;till in a comparatively flouri&s;hing condition. They &s;uffice not only for her own &s;upply, but for the full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tent of foreign demand, and the markets for them have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been materially contracted by the war.&mdash;Her foreign comment continues to be immen&s;e; as a &s;pecimen of it, it may be men|tioned, that the &s;hips from India this year, announced to have been &s;een upon or near the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, amounted to 35 in number, computed to be worth between four and five millions &s;terling. It is no light circum&s;tance in the e&s;timate of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ources, that a va&s;t preponderancy in that quarter of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> continues to nouri&s;h her wealth and power.</P>
<P>If from a view of Great Britain, &s;ingly, we pa&s;s to a view <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her in her foreign connections, we &s;hall find no cau&s;e to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ider her as a pro&s;trate nation.

<P>Again&s;t this will be &s;et the a&s;toni&s;hing victories, heroic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ploits, and va&s;t armies of France, her rapid conque&s;ts to the Rhine, the total reduction of Holland, the progre&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> arms in Spain and Italy, the detaching of the king of Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> from the coalition, and the pro&s;pect of detaching &s;ome others of the German princes; and it will be added, that the conti|nental enemies of France appear exhau&s;ted, de&s;pairing and en|able to continue the war.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028389_0086_0FD8E78F4F012408">
This, if offered only to &s;how that there is no probability that the enemies of France can &s;ucceed in the orginal object of the war again&s;t her, or can dive&s;t her of her acqui&s;itions on the continent, has all the force that may be de&s;ired to be given to it; but when it is u&s;ed to prove that the &s;ituation of Great Britain is &s;o de&s;perate and humbled as to oblige her to receive from France, or the United States, any conditions which either of them may think fit to impo&s;e, the argument is carried infinitely too far. It is one thing for a country to be in a po&s;ture not to receive the law from others, and a very different thing for her to be in a &s;ituation which obliges others to receive the law from her, and what is &s;till &s;tronger, from all her friends. France evidently cannot annoy Ru&s;&s;ia&mdash;&s;he cannot, without great difficulty, from their geographical po&s;ition, make any further acqui&s;itions upon the territories of Au&s;tria. Bri|tain and her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are e&s;&s;entially &s;afe, while &s;he maintains a decided maritime &s;uperiority. As long as this is the ca&s;e, even &s;uppo&s;ing her abandoned by all her allies, &s;he never can be in the &s;ituation which is pretended by the oppo&s;ers of the treaty.</P>
<P>But in de&s;cribing the &s;ituation of France, only one &s;ide of the medal is pre&s;ented. There is another &s;ide far le&s;s flat|tening, and which, in order to come to a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, mu&s;t be impartially viewed.</P>
<P>If the allies of Great Britain are fatigued and exhau&s;ted, France cannot be in a better condition. The efforts of the lat|ter, in proportion to intrin&s;ic re&s;ources, have, no doubt, been much greater than tho&s;e of the former. It is a con&s;equence from this, phy&s;ically certain, that France mu&s;t be &s;till more fa|tigued and exhau&s;ted, even than her adver&s;aries. Her acqui&s;itions cannot materially vary this conclu&s;ion: the low countries, long the theatre of the war, mu&s;t have been pretty well emptied be|fore they fell into her hands. Holland is an artificial power; her life and &s;trength were in her credit; this peri&s;hed with her re|duction. Accordingly the &s;uccours extracted from her, compar|ed with the &s;cale of the war, have been in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>But it is conjectured, that as much has not been done as might have been done; that re&s;titution of the po&s;ts has not been procured, but only a promi&s;e to re&s;tore them at a remote period, in exchange for a former promi&s;e, which had been violated. That there is no good ground of reliance upon the fulfilment of this new promi&s;e, for the performance of which there ought to have been &s;ome &s;urety or guarantee. That the re&s;titution of the po&s;ts ought to have been accompanied with indemnification for the detention, and for the expen&s;es of the Indian wars which have been occa&s;ioned by that deten|tion,
<PB N="88" REF="028389_0087_0FD8E792DDC51FD0">and by the in&s;tigation of Briti&s;h intrigue. That it was bet|ter to go to war than to relinqui&s;h our claim to &s;uch indem|nification; or if our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances did not recommend this, it was better to wait till it was more convenient to us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enforce our claims, than to give them up.&mdash;The&s;e are the de|clamations by which this part of the treaty is arraigned. Let us &s;ee if they are the random effu&s;ions of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or the ra|tional dictates of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ugge&s;tion, that more might have been done than was done, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be more conjecture and ima|gination. If the picture given of the &s;ituation of Great Bri|tain, was better ju&s;tified by facts than it is, it would not fol|low that the &s;ugge&s;tion is true; for the thing would depend not on the real &s;ituation of the country, but on the opinion entertained of it by its own admini&s;tration, on the per&s;onal character of the prince and of his council; on the degree i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which they were influenced by pride and pa&s;&s;ion, or by rea&s;on. The hypothe&s;is, that the di&s;po&s;itions of a government are con|formable with its &s;ituation, it as fallacious a one as can be en|tertained. It is to &s;uppo&s;e, contrary to every day's experience, that cabinets are always wi&s;e. It is, on the part of tho&s;e who draw the inference, to &s;uppo&s;e, that a cabinet, the mo&s;t vio|lent, ra&s;h, and fooli&s;h, of Europe, is at the &s;ame time mode|rate and prudent enough to act according to the true &s;ituation of the country. Who of our enthu&s;ia&s;ts, rea&s;oning from his view of the aba&s;ed condition of Great-Britain, has not long &s;ince imagined that &s;he ought to be on her knees to France, &s;uing for mercy and forgivene&s;s? Yet how different hitherto is the fact! If we carefully peru&s;e the &s;peeches of the leading members of the convention, we &s;hall ob&s;erve the mena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> again&s;t Britain frequently inter&s;per&s;ed with invitations to peace; while the Briti&s;h government maintains a proud and di&s;tant re&s;erve, repels every idea of peace, and inflexibly pur&s;ues the path of war. If the &s;ituation of Europe in general, and of Great Britain in particular, as is pretended, authorized us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expect whatever we cho&s;e, how happens it that France, with all her victories, has not yet been able to extort peace?</P>
<P>As to the true po&s;ition of France, we are not left to mere inference. All the official reports, all the private accounts from thence acknowledge a &s;late of extreme embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;|tre&s;s; an alarming d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rangement of the finances, and a &s;carcity not di&s;tant from famine. &s;o this are to be added, a continu|ance of violent and de&s;tructive conflicts of parties, and the un|extingui&s;hable ember<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of in&s;urrection.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="028389_0088_0FD8E794D83D5A50">
This fair compari&s;on of the relative &s;ituation of the contending parties, will, I know, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tigmatized as blazoning the &s;trength and re&s;ources of Great Britain, and depreciating the advantages of France. But the cant phra&s;es of party cannot alter the na|ture of truth&mdash;nor will they prevent the people of the United States from li&s;tening impartially to it, or from di&s;cerning that it is a mark of fidelity to their intere&s;ts, to counteract mi&s;repre|&s;entation, by placing facts fairly before them, and a duty which they owe to them&s;elves, and which they cannot omit to per|form without betraying their own intere&s;ts, to receive them candidly, and weigh them maturely.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion is, that all tho&s;e highly-charged declamations which de&s;cribe Great Britain to us as vanqui&s;hed and humbled; as ready to pa&s;s under the yoke at command, and to &s;ubmit to any conditions which we may think fit to pre&s;cribe, are either the chimeras of over-heated imaginations, or the &s;abrication of impo&s;tors; and if li&s;tened to, can have no other effect than to in&s;pire a delu&s;ive pre&s;umption, and a dangerous temerity.</P>
<P>But to judge the better of the extravagance of the&s;e decla|mations, it will be u&s;eful to go back to the periods when the negociation began and ended. Our envoy arrived in England and entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion, at the moment when there was a general elation on account of the naval victo|ry gained by Lord Howe, and previous to tho&s;e important &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, which have terminated in the conque&s;t of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of Novemver la&s;t, prior to the la&s;t mentioned event, and the defection of the king of Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffia. The po&s;ture of things at the time it was in negocia|tion, and not at this time, is the &s;tandard by which to try its merits; and it may be ob&s;erved, that it is probable the negoci|ation received its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and even its general outline anterior to the principal part of the di&s;a&s;ters &s;u&s;tained by the coale&s;ced powers in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t campaign.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to add, that if we credit the repre|&s;entations of our envoy, Great Britain manife&s;ted &s;imilar di&s;po|&s;itions with regard to the treaty at the commencement as at the clo&s;e of the negociation: whence it will follow, that too much has been attributed in this country to the victories of France.</P>

<P>ONE of the particulars, in which our envoy is alleged to have fallen &s;hort of what might or ought to have been done, re&s;pects the time for the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. It is alleged, that there ought either to have been an immediate &s;urrender, or &s;ome guarantee or &s;urety for the performance of the new promi&s;e. Both parts of the alternative pre&s;uppo&s;e that Great Britain was to have no will upon the &s;ubject; that no circum&s;tances of &s;ecurity or convenience to her were to be con&s;ulted; that our envoy was not to negociate, but to com|mand. How un&s;ub&s;tantial the foundation on which this cour&s;e of proceeding is recommended, has been already developed.</P>
<P>The fact was, that our envoy pre&s;&s;ed an early evacuation of the po&s;ts; but there was an inflexible adherence, on the other &s;ide, to the term limited in the treaty. The rea&s;ons under&s;tood to have been a&s;&s;igned for it, were to this effect, viz. That ac|cording to the cour&s;e of the Indian trade, it was cu&s;tomary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pread through the nations, goods to a large amount; the re|turns for which could not be drawn into Canada, in a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|er period than was propo&s;ed to be fixed for the evacuation; that the impre&s;&s;ion which the &s;urrender of all the po&s;ts to Ame|rican garri&s;ons might make on the minds of the Indians, could not be fore&s;een; that there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on for caution, as, on a former occa&s;ion, it had been intimated to them by public agents of the United &s;tates, that they had been <HI>for&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and <HI>given up</HI> by the Briti&s;h government; that the protection promi&s;ed on our part, however &s;incere, and however competent in other re&s;pects, might not be &s;ufficient in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to prevent the embarra&s;&s;ment which might en&s;ue; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e rea&s;ons the traders ought to have time to conclude th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> adventures, which were predicated upon the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things; that they would in future calculate upon the new &s;tate of things; but that, in the mean time, the care of government ought not to be withdrawn from them.</P>
<P>There is ground to believe, that there were repre&s;entatie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on behalf of the Canada traders, alleging a longer term than that which was adopted in the treaty, to be nece&s;&s;ary to wind up and adapt their arrangements to the new &s;tate of things; and that the term &s;ugge&s;ted by them was abridged &s;everal months. And it may not be u&s;ele&s;s to ob&s;erve, as explanatory to the rea&s;ons given, that in fact it is the cour&s;e of the trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give long credits to the Indians, and that the returns for good furni&s;hed in one year, only come in the next year.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="028389_0090_0FD8E79793144318">
What was to be done in this ca&s;e? Was the negociation to break off, or was the delay to be admitted? The la&s;t was pre|ferred by our envoy; and the preference was rightly judged.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of breaking off the negociation has been &s;tated. No rea&s;onable man will doubt, that delay was prefera|ble to war, if there be good ground of reliance, that the &s;ti|pulation will be fulfilled at the appointed time. Let us calmly examine this point.</P>
<P>The argument again&s;t it, is drawn from the breach of the former promi&s;e. To be authorized to pre&s;s this argument, we ought to be &s;ure that all was right on our part.&mdash;After what has been offered on this &s;ubject, are we &s;till convinced that this was the ca&s;e? Are we able to &s;ay, that there was nothing in our conduct which furni&s;hed a ground for that of Great Britain? Has it not been &s;hown to be a fact, that, from the arrival of the provi&s;ional articles in this country, till after the ratification thereof, by the definitive treaty, acts of &s;tates inter|dicting the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, and other acts militating again&s;t the treaty, continued in operation? Can we doubt, that &s;ubjects of Great Britain, affected by the&s;e acts, carried com|plaints to the ears of their government? Can we wonder, if they made &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions there, if they produced di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction and di&s;tru&s;t? Is it very extraordinary, if they excited the idea of detaining the po&s;ts as a pledge, till there were better indications on our part? Is it &s;urpri&s;ing, if the continuance of the&s;e acts, and the addition of others, which were new and po&s;itive breaches of the treaty, prolonged the detention of the po&s;ts?&mdash;</P>
<P>In fine, was the delay in &s;urrendering &s;o entirely de&s;titute of cau&s;e, &s;o unequivocal a proof of a per&s;idious character, as to ju&s;tify the conclu&s;ion, that no future dependence can be made on the promi&s;es of the Briti&s;h government? Di&s;cerning men will not ha&s;tily &s;ub&s;cribe to this conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mutual charges of breach of faith are not uncommon be|tween nations: yet this does not prevent their making new &s;tipulations with each other, and relying upon their perform|ance. The argument from the breach of one promi&s;e, if real, to the breach of every other, is not &s;upported by experience; and if adopted as a general rule, would multiply, infinitely, the impediments to accord and agreement among nations.</P>
<P>The truth is, that though nations will too often evade their promi&s;es on colourable pretexts, yet few are &s;o profligate as to do it without &s;uch pretexts. In clear ca&s;es, &s;elf-intere&s;t dictates a regard to the obligations of good faith: nor is there any thing in the hi&s;tory of Great Britain which warrants the opinion,
<PB N="92" REF="028389_0091_0FD8BE8E88FD9320">that &s;he is more unmindful than other nations, of her character for good faith.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he mu&s;t be &s;o, and in an extreme degree, if &s;he be ca|pable of breaking, without real cau&s;e, a <HI>&s;econd</HI> promi&s;e on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> point, after the termination, by a new treaty, of an old di&s;pute concerning it, and this too on the ba&s;is of mutual repa|ration. It would indicate a de&s;titution of principle, a contempt of character, much beyond the u&s;ual mea&s;ure, and to an extent which it may be affirmed is entirely improbable.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance of &s;ome moment in the que&s;tion, that the &s;econd promi&s;e is free from the vaguene&s;s of the fir&s;t, a to the time of execution&mdash;It is not to be performed <HI>with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> convenient &s;peed,</HI> but by a day certain, which cannot be exce|ed. This would give point to violation, and render it unequi|vocal.</P>
<P>Another argument, again&s;t the probability of performance has been deduced from the &s;uppo&s;ed deficiency of good rea&s;on for the delay, which is repre&s;ented as evidence of want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cerity in the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;ons which were a&s;&s;igned for that delay, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> are others that may be conjectured to have operated, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would not have been equally convenient to avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;erve to explain the delay different from the &s;uppo&s;ition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> having been calculated for ultimate eva&s;ion.

The intere&s;t which every nation has, in not entirely forfeiting its reputation for honor and fidelity. 2d. The intere&s;t which re&s;ults from the correlative &s;tipulation with regard to the indemnification for the Briti&s;h debts, a point upon which there will be no incon&s;i|derable mercantile &s;en&s;ibility. 3d. The intere&s;t of pre&s;erving peace with this country, the interruption of which, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed, could not fail to attend the non-&s;urrender of the po&s;ts at the &s;tipulated time.</P>
<P>It is morally certain, that circum&s;tances will every day add &s;trength to this la&s;t motive.&mdash;Time has already done much for us, and will do more. Every hour's continuance of the war in Europe, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily add to the inconveniencies of a rupture with this country, and to the motives which Great Britain mu&s;t feel, to avoid an increa&s;e of the number of her enemies, in de&s;ire peace, and, if obtained, to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>The enemies of the treaty, upon their own calculations, can hardly di&s;pute, that if the war continues another year after the pre&s;ent, the probable &s;ituation of Great Britain, will be a com|plete &s;ecurity, for her compliance with her promi&s;e, to &s;urren|der the po&s;ts. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t us &s;uppo&s;e, that a general peace takes place in Europe this winter, what may then be the di&s;po&s;ition of Great Britain in June next, as to war or peace with this country?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that the &s;ituation will be, of all others, that which is mo&s;t likely to indi&s;po&s;e her to a war with us. There is no juncture, at which war is more unwelcome to a nation, than immediately after the experience of another war, which has re|quired great exertions, and has been exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ive, bloody, and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lamitous. The minds of all men then dread the renewal of &s;o great an evil, and are di&s;po&s;ed rather to make &s;acrifices to peace than to plunge afre&s;h into ho&s;tilities. The &s;ituation of Great Britain, at the end of the war, in which &s;he is now engaged, is likely to be the mo&s;t di&s;couraging that can be im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gined to the provocation of new wars. Here we may di&s;cover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> powerful &s;ecurity for the performance of her &s;tipu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations.</P>

<P>But why was there not equally good rea&s;on that we &s;hould have given a guarantee or &s;urety for the performance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> new promi&s;e, with regard to the debts?

Should we have thought it very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|putable to our&s;elves, to have been obliged to furni&s;h it?</P>
<P>The arguments of the oppo&s;ers of the treaty, are extre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ly at variance with each other. On the one hand, they rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;ent it as fraught with advantages to Great Britain, without equivalents to the United States&mdash;as a premeditated &s;cheme to &s;acrifice our trade and navigation to hers&mdash;as a plan dictated by her, for drawing the two countries into clo&s;e connection and alliance, and for making our intere&s;ts &s;ub&s;ervient to hers; on the other hand, they tell us, that there is no &s;ecurity for the &s;urrender of the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, according to &s;tipulation.

Would Great Britain give us this op|tion, in a ca&s;e in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e had &s;o much to lo&s;e by doing is?</P>
<P>This gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring colli&s;ion of arguments, proves how &s;uper&s;f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ally the adver&s;aries of the treaty have con&s;idered the &s;ubject, and how little reliance can be placed on the views they give of it.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating the plan which the treaty adopts, for the &s;et|tlement of the old controver&s;y, it is an important re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ection, that, from the cour&s;e of things, there will be nothing to be performed by us before the period for the re&s;titution of the po&s;ts will have elap&s;ed; and that, if this re&s;titution &s;hould be evaded, we &s;hall be free to put an end to the whole treaty, about which there could not be a moment's he&s;itation. We &s;hould then be where we were before the treaty, with the ad|vantage of having &s;trengthened the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, by removing every occa&s;ion of reproach, which the infractions of the treaty of peace may have furni&s;hed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Two other particulars, in which this part of the treaty is &s;uppo&s;ed to be defective, regard the want of indemnification
<PB N="95" REF="028389_0094_0FD8E7A450BBF368">for the detention of the po&s;ts, and for the expen&s;es of Indian wars.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who make the objection, may be &s;afely challenged to produce precedents of &s;imilar indemnifications, unle&s;s impo&s;ed by <HI>conquering</HI> powers on the vanqui&s;hed, or by powers of over|hearing &s;trength upon tho&s;e which were too weak to di&s;pute the logic of &s;uperior force. If this were the real &s;ituation of the United States and Great Britain, then is the treaty inex|cu&s;ably faulty; but if the parties were to treat and agree as equal powers, then is the preten&s;ion extravagant and impracti|cable. The re&s;titution of the &s;pecific thing detained, is all that was to be expected, and, it may be added, it is all that was ever really expected on the part of this country, &s;o far as we may rea&s;on either from official acts or informal expre&s;&s;ions of the public opinion.</P>
<P>In ea&s;es where clear injuries are done, affecting objects of known or ea&s;ily a&s;certained values, pecuniary compen&s;ation may be expected to be obtained by negociation; but it is be|lieved that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to cite an example of compen|&s;ation &s;o obtained, in a ca&s;e in which territory has been with|held on a di&s;pute of title, or as a ho&s;tage for &s;ome other claim (as, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, for &s;ecuring the performance of the 4th article of the treaty of peace.) The recovery of the territory withheld is the u&s;ual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The want of a rule to adju&s;t con&s;equential damages, is, in &s;uch ca&s;es, a very great difficulty. In the in&s;tance under di&s;taffion, this difficulty would be peculiarly great.&mdash;The po&s;ts are, for the mo&s;t part, in a wilderne&s;s. There are but two of them which have any adjacent &s;ettlements; Point-au-fer, or Dutchman's point, to which a part of a tract of land, called Cald well's Manor, with a few inhabitants, has been claimed as appurtenant; and Detroit, which has a &s;ettlement in the town and neighbourhood of between two and three thou&s;and &s;ouls. In the vicinity of the other po&s;ts, on our &s;ide, there is &s;carcely an inhabitant. It follows, that very little damage could be pre|dicated either upon the lo&s;s of revenue from, or of the pro|fits of trade with, the &s;ettlements in the vicinity of the po&s;ts. The trade of the Indians within our limits would con&s;equent|ly be the ba&s;is of the claim of compen&s;ation.&mdash;But here the ignorance or &s;pirit of exaggeration of the opponents of the treaty has been particularly exemplified. The annual lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from this &s;ource has been &s;tated by a very zealous writer again&s;t the treaty, who &s;igns him&s;elf <HI>Cato,</HI> at 800, 000 dollars.</P>
<P>Now it is a fact well a&s;certained, that the mean value of the whole exports from Canada in peltries (which con&s;titute the
<PB N="96" REF="028389_0095_0FD8E7AB9F75C988">returns of Indian trade) in the years 1786 and 1787, was &s;omething &s;hort of 800, 000 dollars. It is al&s;o a fact, in which all men, informed on the &s;ubject, agree, that the trade with the Indians, within our limits,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of peltries exported from Canada in 1786 and 1787.

<P>But might not a claim, even of this &s;um, by way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> demnification, be encountered with &s;ome &s;orce, by the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|vation, that there is the highe&s;t probability that the capital a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> labour which would have been employed to produce 20, 000 dollars profit on the trade with the Indians, have been quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|productively employed in other channels, and con&s;equen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that there may have been no lo&s;s at all?</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how erroneous are the data which &s;erve to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|nify claims, in them&s;elves in&s;ignificant, and which, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of indemnification for the expen&s;es of Indian wars, independent of the unu&s;ual nature of the claim, might have been matter of endle&s;s debate. We might have been told, that the Indians a&s;cribe tho&s;e wars to preten&s;ions upon their lands, by virtue of treaties with the former govern|ment of the United States, impo&s;ed by violence, or contract|ed with partial and inadequate repre&s;entations of their nation &mdash;that our own public records witne&s;s, that the proceedings of our agents, at &s;ome of tho&s;e treaties, were far from unexcep|tionable &mdash;that the wars complained of are to be attributed to errors in our former policy, or mi&s;management of our public agents, not to the detention of the po&s;ts&mdash;that it mu&s;t be pro|blematical how much of the duration or expen&s;es of tho&s;e wars are chargeable upon that detention&mdash;and, that the po&s;ts having been detained by way of &s;ecurity for the performance of the article re&s;pecting debts, there was no re&s;pon&s;ibility for collateral and ca&s;ual damages. Had we re&s;orted to the charge of their having in&s;tigated or prompted tho&s;e wars, they would have denied the charge, as they have repeatedly done before; and, though we might have been able to adduce circum&s;tances of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them, they would have conte&s;ted their validi|ty and force, and, whether guilty or not, would have thought their honor concerned in avoiding the mo&s;t di&s;tant conce&s;&s;ion of having participated in &s;o improper a bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In every view, therefore, the claim for indemnification was a hopele&s;s one; and to in&s;i&s;t upon it would have an&s;wered no other purpo&s;e than to render an amicable adju&s;tment impo&s;&s;i|ble. No Briti&s;h mini&s;ter would have dared to go to a Briti&s;h parliament to a&s;k provi&s;ion for &s;uch an expenditure. What, then, was to be done? Were we now or hereafter to go to war to enforce the claim? &s;uppo&s;e this done, and fifty or a hundred millions of dollars expended in the conte&s;t, what cer|tainty is there that we &s;hould at la&s;t accompli&s;h the object?</P>
<P>Moreover, the principle of &s;uch a war would require, that we &s;hould &s;eek indemnification for the expen&s;es of the war it&s;elf, in addition to our former claim. What pro&s;pect is there, that this al&s;o would be effected? yet if not effected, it is evident that we &s;hould have made a mo&s;t wretched bargain.</P>
<P>Why did we not in&s;i&s;t on indemnification for the expen&s;es of our revoiution war? Surely, not becau&s;e it was le&s;s rea&s;onable, but becau&s;e it was evident that it could not have been obtained, and becau&s;e peace was nece&s;&s;ary to us as well as to our enemy.
<PB N="98" REF="028389_0097_0FD8E7AEE8FA0168">This likewi&s;e would be the end of a war undertaken to enfore the claim of indemnification for the detention of the po&s;ts.

<HEAD><HI>RESOLUTIONS</HI> Unanimou&s;ly agreed to, at a Meeting of the Citizens of <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> on Saturday the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, as the opinion of this meeting, That a &s;trict adherence to the principles of the con&s;titution, ought at all times to be regarded, as the fir&s;t duty of public officers, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every department; and that it is the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> only to guard again&s;t the exerci&s;e of a power which has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been delegated, but to &s;ee that a power confided to the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> branches of congre&s;s collectively, &s;hall not be a&s;&s;umed by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> only, or by two of them.</P>
<P>The members of this meeting conceive, that the con&s;titutio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the United States, has empowered congre&s;s, and not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ident and &s;enate,</P>
<Q><P>To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and with the Indian tribes:</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of naturalization:</P>
<P>To define and puni&s;h piracies:</P>
<P>To declare war, &amp;c. and make rules concerning capture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on land and water;&mdash;and</P>
<P>To lay and collect taxes, duties, exci&s;es, and impo&s;ts</P></Q>
<P>And, therefore, that &s;o much of the 3d, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th articles of the treaty, now under con&s;ideration, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pects the regulation of trade;</P>
<P>So much of the 2d article as gives to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject the rights of a natural-born citizen of the United States; without the previous re&s;idence, and other requi&s;ites, enumerated in the late act of Congre&s;s;</P>
<P>So much of the 21&s;t article as defines and puni&s;hes an act therein pronounced to be piracy;</P>
<P>So much of the 17th article as makes a rule in ca&s;es where ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be captured or detained, on &s;u&s;picion of having enemy's property on board;&mdash;and,</P>
<P>So much of the 3d and 15th articles as contains a &s;urrender, by two branches of the government of the United States, of a
<PB N="103" REF="028389_0102_0FD8E7B6882C4130">right entru&s;ted to the whole congre&s;s, of laying duties and im|po&s;ts, on Briti&s;h and other ve&s;&s;els, at di&s;cretion;</P>
<P>Are contrary to the con&s;titution, and that the ratification of the&s;e clau&s;es would be ab&s;olutely void.</P>
<P>The members compo&s;ing this meeting, view, with no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment than concern, the contempt manife&s;ted by the &s;e|nate, for the con&s;titution of the United States, in advi&s;ing the pre&s;ident to ratify, provi&s;ionally, a treaty, which violates the e&s;|&s;ential principles of our government, and excludes the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, from an exerci&s;e of powers expre&s;sly given to them, as well as to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. They are of opi|nion, that the conduct of the &s;enate demands the &s;erious atten|tion of every real friend to the union; and that an attempt &s;o daring and &s;o dangerous, calls for the mo&s;t pointed and unequi|vocal cen&s;ure from the people.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this meeting, That the idea on which this treaty is founded, of <Q>terminating the differences between the United States and Great Britain, without refer|ence to the merits of their complaints and preten&s;ions,</Q> is as fallacious as it is new; that it is contrary to the principles &s;anctioned by the executive in the corre&s;pondence between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ecretary of &s;tate and Mr. Hammond; and ought to be re|probated by a nation which regards either its honor or its in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o the opinion of this meeting, That the &s;ilence of this treaty, with re&s;pect to the &s;laves and other property carried off by the Briti&s;h troops, contrary to the 7th article of the defini|tive treaty, is in the highe&s;t degree reprehen&s;ible; becau&s;e a claim for compen&s;ation, on this account, being a matter of dif|ference, ought, even under the idea above mentioned, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een brought forward; becau&s;e &s;uch a claim is founded on an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpre&s;s obligation created by the treaty of 1783, as well as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tice and good faith; and becau&s;e in the corre&s;pondent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> above mentioned, between the late &s;ecretary and Mr. Hammond, this claim is ranked, not among tho&s;e things which are of "&s;maller <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oncern," and may therefore "be pa&s;&s;ed over," but "in&s;i&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n," as one, "rendered indi&s;pen&s;ible by ju&s;tice to individuals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by public policy."</P>

<P>Re&s;olved, al&s;o, as the opinion of this meeting, That an <HI>inde|pendent people</HI> ought not to conclude a treaty of any kind, with any nation, but on terms of perfect equality. They regard this as a &s;acred principle, from which every con&s;ideration of ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and intere&s;t, forbids this country to depart. Under this imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;ion, they view with abhorrence a treaty, the &s;tipulations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which, even after the 12th article &s;hall be removed, &s;o une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> vocally admit the preten&s;ions of Great Britain, to a monopoly of commercial advantages, to be well founded.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, al&s;o, as the opinion of this meeting, That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> article is unju&s;t, in principle, and will be pernicious in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Unju&s;t, becau&s;e, a government is not re&s;pon&s;ible for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of its citizens, unle&s;s it ratifies or approves them; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> now to be paid by the United States, were due from private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dividuals, previous to the adoption of the federal &s;y&s;tem; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> becau&s;e the pre&s;ent government, in&s;tead of throwing imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ments in the way of the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, has o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ized courts, who&s;e only employment has been to enforce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> payment: And pernicious, becau&s;e the circum&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall entitle a creditor to redre&s;s before the commi&s;&s;ioner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not enumerated, as they might ea&s;ily have been, and thus g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> latitude is left for the exerci&s;e of di&s;cretionary powers&mdash;becau&s;e it cannot be pre&s;umed that the real debtors will appear bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> commi&s;&s;ioners at a di&s;tance, to controvert claims, in which they are no longer intere&s;ted; and thus a door will be ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to frauds, the extent of which exceeds calculation: And be|cau&s;e it tends to a wanton accumulation of the public de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> already &s;welled to a &s;ize beyond the fears of the friends, or the hopes of the enemies, of the union.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, al&s;o, as the opinion of this meeting, That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> article is defective, becau&s;e it does not contain an expre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cognition of the illegality of the orders which were i&s;&s;ued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Briti&s;h mini&s;try in 1793, and which occa&s;ioned the capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> complained of by the United States: and becau&s;e it obliges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> United States to pay for ve&s;&s;els taken within their limits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> juri&s;diction, though they are not bound to France, or to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other nation, in like manner, by their treaties with them; and although in ca&s;es of the like nature which may hereafter occur, the 25th article obliges the United States not to pay
<PB N="105" REF="028389_0104_0FD8E7BC4B9702B0">but only to u&s;e their be&s;t efforts to obtain &s;atisfaction from the offending party.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this meeting, That in the event of a war, or national difference, it may be both ju&s;t and poli|tic, to &s;eque&s;ter and even confi&s;cate debts, due in this country, to the individuals of a nation at war with the United States; and that, <HI>if this power could be relinqui&s;hed,</HI> &s;ound policy requires, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, it &s;hould be retained.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this meeting. That as by the law of nations (according to the modern conventions) and by the treaties between the United States and the French, the Dutch, the Swedes and the Pru&s;&s;ians, free &s;hips make free goods;&mdash;the 17th article of this treaty, which &s;ubjects French property in American bottoms to &s;eizure, de&s;erves the mo&s;t pointed reprobation; becau&s;e, it will immediately deprive the American merchants, of the benefit of carrying the goods of na|tions at war with Great-Britain; becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of a war be|tween the United States and France, <HI>which the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>forbid!</HI> American property, in Briti&s;h neutral ve&s;&s;els, would be &s;ecure; and becau&s;e, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affaire, it will produce &s;uch injury to the French, as will give them <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;e of re&s;entment</HI> again&s;t the partial policy of the American government.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this meeting, That the &s;tipulation in the 18th article, making &s;hip-timber, tar, hemp, &s;ails and copper, contraband of war, which are free by our treaties with other nations, is unnece&s;&s;arily hurtful to the trade of the United States, and manife&s;ts the &s;ame unfriendly temper to the French.</P>
<P>The members of this meeting are al&s;o of opinion, That all good citizens &s;hould expre&s;s their decided di&s;approbation of the &s;econd clau&s;e of the 18th article, which authorizes, though not in words, yet in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;eizure of American ve&s;&s;els carrying provi&s;ions to France.</P>
<P>The members of this meeting &s;olemnly declare their abhor|rence of a conce&s;&s;ion, &s;o incompatible with the object of the late emba&s;&s;y, &s;o derogatory to the honor, &s;o injurious to the intere&s;ts of America, and &s;o openly and pointedly ho&s;tile to the cau&s;e of France. They dete&s;t a war; they con&s;ider it as trea&s;on again&s;t the happine&s;s of men; but they would cheer|fully endure all the calamities which it produces, rather than in any &s;hape be acce&s;&s;ary to a combination, which is the &s;courge of Europe, and the di&s;honor of the world.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved therefore, as the opinion of this meeting, That this treaty <HI>ought not to be ratified</HI> by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate of the
<PB N="106" REF="028389_0105_0FD8E7BDDE51C3B8">United States, even if the Briti&s;h king &s;hould con&s;ent to a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of &s;o much of the 12th article as re&s;pects the trade to be carried on, between the United States and the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the chairman of this meeting be reque&s;ted to adopt &s;uch method as he judges be&s;t, to furni&s;h the pre&s;ident with a copy of the above re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>The following re&s;olutions were al&s;o agreed to by the meeting.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the minority of the &s;enate, who oppo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ratification of the treaty with Great Britain, are entitled to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thanks of their country; and that the &s;enators from this &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> have ju&s;tified the confidence repo&s;ed in them by their con|&s;tituents.</P>

<P>THE &s;entiments which are now re&s;pectfully addre&s;&s;ed to you, are not, merely, the emanations of a &s;olitary indi|vidual; they have been already expre&s;&s;ed by thou&s;ands of your fellow citizens, who&s;e united voices urge you to adhere to tho&s;e principles of patrioti&s;m, which have &s;o honorably direct|ed all your public conduct, by withholding or &s;u&s;pending the la&s;t final act which re&s;ts with you for giving effect to the de|pending treaty between the United States and Great-Britain, or by giving &s;uch a direction to the further negociations re|&s;pecting it, as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y produce a material change from its pre&s;ent form.

<P>He has omitted to make any &s;tipulation for the protection and &s;ecurity of the commerce of the United States to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean, again&s;t the depredations of the Algerines and Barbary cor&s;airs; although he knew that this forms one of the mo&s;t beneficial branches of our trade, yielding a large annual balance in &s;pecie in favor of the United States; and that the policy of our government has been, in all their trea|ties with the maritime powers, to obtain &s;uch a &s;tipulation, it be|ing expre&s;sly provided in both our exi&s;ting treaties with France and Holland, that tho&s;e powers &s;hall u&s;e their good offices and be&s;t endeavours to obtain this object&mdash;Nor could he be ignorant of what is avowed by lord Sheffield, one of the Briti&s;h king's privy council, to be the true policy of Great-Britain; name|ly, to countenance and encourage Algerine depredations on the American trade, and to prevent us, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from becoming carriers. And this omi&s;&s;ion is now the more to be regretted, &s;ince the recent official intelligence announced in all the new&s;papers, that the Algerines, under the media|tion of Great Britain and Spain, have made peace with Por|tugal, in con&s;equence of which, the Portugue&s;e crui&s;ers are to be recalled from the Mediterranean, and the Algerines again let loo&s;e on the commerce of the United States.</P>

Be&s;ides, if the con&s;truction of the term "now," in the 9th article of the treaty, &s;hould allow Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to hold lands within the United States, purcha&s;ed at any time before the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty, the acquirement of &s;tate rights by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects may occa&s;ion &s;erious que&s;tions, is to the power of extingui&s;hing the Indian claims, which the intercour&s;e will turn to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t.

<P>The 4th article contains a fruitful &s;ource for future war, be|cau&s;e it puts the uncertainty it &s;tates upon a wor&s;e ground than it &s;tood before; it being a well known hi&s;torical fact, that by a &s;imilar omi&s;&s;ion in the treaty of Utrecht, in not providing a mode for a&s;certaining definitively the boundary line between the French and Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America, the famous &s;even years war was produced between tho&s;e two nations, which ter|minated in the peace of Paris, and a total relinqui&s;hment of all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of France in America to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The 6th article &s;tands un&s;upported by any principle of treaty or of the law of nations. The able di&s;qui&s;ition of Mr. Jeffer&s;on on this &s;ubject, in his diplomatic corre&s;pondence with Mr.
<PB N="110" REF="028389_0109_0FD8E7C9F0D8BAF0">Hummond, is irrefragable on this point; be&s;ides, this article is exceptionable in the following in&s;tances.</P>
<P>It &s;anctions claims again&s;t the United States for Briti&s;h lo&s;&s;es, when the legal impediments comprehended in the treaty of 1783, may not have occa&s;ioned tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es. Legal impediments as comprehended in that treaty, cannot extend further than is &s;tatutory regulations, peculiarly applicable to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, yet, where the general rules of evidence applied to the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, prevented the recovery, this article authorizes a claim upon the United States for the lo&s;s, as in the in&s;tances of intere&s;t di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|lowed during the war, lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by payments in dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ated paper money, and the defeat of evidence to e&s;tabli&s;h open accounts, under the &s;tate laws.</P>
<P>It erects a court to controul the courts of the United States, which, and the &s;orms of proceeding in which, ought to be the only con&s;titutional re&s;ort in controver&s;ies proper for judici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y tribunals. If the court of commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould allow a rode of evidence contrary to that deemed admi&s;&s;ible by the courts of the United States, the United States are placed in a &s;ituation as be made chargeable with the payment of debts, which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ditor could not recover again&s;t the debtor in the ordinary cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of ju&s;tice, allowing full operation to the treaty of 1783; be&s;ide a refu&s;al to admit &s;uch evidence in the courts of the United States, in&s;tantly becomes a legal impediment, to be reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l again&s;t by the court of commi&s;&s;ioners, even when the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> is &s;olvent.</P>
<P>It creates, in the a&s;&s;umption of the&s;e debts by the United States, a &s;ource of taxation, which is alike to be borne by the innocent ob&s;erver of the laws, and the guilty infractor of il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, without any rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of being reimbur&s;ed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> debtors.</P>
<P>It omits to require, on behalf of the United States, that ju&s;t &s;et off again&s;t the&s;e claims which the carrying away the negroes by the Briti&s;h, in violation of the treaty of 1783, al|lowed the United States to demand.</P>
<P>The 7th article is fallacious and delu&s;ory. It does not re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the effects of the Briti&s;h orders of November 1793, and Janua|ry 1794, but allows them full operation; and only affects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> offer relief in ca&s;es where tho&s;e orders and the law of nations have been illegally or irregularly executed. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing the principle contained in the 6th article, of di&s;regarding the deci&s;ions of courts, and placing the merits of the complaint be|fore the commi&s;&s;ioners, it obliges the commi&s;&s;ioners to act in obedience to the deci&s;ions of the Briti&s;h courts, where tho&s;e de|ci&s;ions have been regular and legal. If then the law of nations
<PB N="111" REF="028389_0110_0FD8E7CD905F3D08">and the orders of November and January have been regularly executed by tho&s;e courts, the complaints of our government are temedile&s;s, and the true ground of tho&s;e complaints abandoned by the treaty. Be&s;ides, the &s;tipulation was unnece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;es of irregul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or illegal condemnation, except where there was an in&s;olvency on the part of the captors; and therefore the article wears, upon the whole face of it, a total relinqui&s;hment, on the part of our negociator, of the merits of our claims, and our merchants have no right to expect one &s;hilling of recom|pen&s;e for their lo&s;&s;es. Further, the la&s;t clau&s;e of this article, does not adhere to the principle &s;upported in the 6th article, but again re&s;orts to the merits of Briti&s;h complaints, and pro|mi&s;es compen&s;ation; &s;howing, that whenever American de|mands were &s;ubmitted upon the principles of equity, the Briti&s;h negociator kept them in the courts for deci&s;ion; and whenever their demands were urged, our negociator abandoned that prin|ciple.</P>
<P>The 9th article is ambiguous, and its con&s;truction doubtful; but let that con&s;truction be as it may, whenever, in the cour&s;e of inheritance, alienage &s;hall &s;top the cour&s;e of de&s;cent, the right by e&s;cheat, accruing thereby to individual &s;tates, is taken away; and this principle may, and doubtle&s;s will, be extended to the territorial rights of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>The 10th article rever&s;es the good old maxim, 'that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;' and our nego|ciator &s;eems to have though that war fir&s;t, and confi&s;cation af|terwards, was better than &s;eque&s;tration fir&s;t and peace after|wards; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that the greater evil, <HI>war,</HI> will not generally, if not always, produce the le&s;&s;er evil, <HI>confi&s;cation.</HI> But the article is de&s;titute of all equality; Great Britain has fleets and armies, America none. Great Britain, by means of fleets and armies, can enforce the ob&s;ervance of our national duties towards her; we cannot re&s;ort to the &s;ame means for the &s;ame ends: But the annual balance of trade be|tween the two countries is largely in favour of Great Britain; &s;he has always a large amount of property or of debts in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, over which, the power of &s;eque&s;tration or confi&s;cati|on, may be regarded as the American weapon of defence, pre|ventive, equally, of future &s;poliations and depredations on our commerce, as of war it&s;elf. Humanity, therefore, is no le&s;s out|raged by this &s;tipulation than every principle of policy, ju&s;tice, and national right.</P>
<P>Thus, fir, have I endeavoured to lay before you the omi&s;&s;i|ons of our negociator, as well as &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious ob|jections to the ten fir&s;t articles, which, by the 28th articles, are

<P>AS the emba&s;&s;y extraordinary to Great Britain, from the appointment of the envoy, to the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, is unequalled in the annals of negociation, it becomes <HI>us, the people,</HI> who are yet the <HI>con&s;titutional &s;overeigns</HI> of the country, to con&s;ider it with attention, that it may in future either &s;erve as a friendly beacon to point out a &s;ecure harbour in political &s;torms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> avoided as a light perfidiou&s;ly hung out to lure our un&s;u&s;pecting b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocks and quick&s;ands.</P>

It is e&s;&s;ential to the due con&s;ideration of the advantages and di&s;advantages of a treaty, to examine the contracting parties; becau&s;e the &s;ame treaty may be good under &s;ome, and bad under other circum&s;tances; thus, when Carthage gave up her &s;hips, wealth, and arms in the &s;econd Punic war&mdash;the treaty might have been con&s;idered as good in relation to her then &s;ituation, humbled as &s;he was by the Roman arms, and compelled to rely for her exi&s;tence, as a nation, <HI>&s;olely on the ju&s;tice and humanity</HI> of the Roman &s;enate; and yet a treaty of this &s;ort would have been con&s;idered as ba&s;e and abject, if it had been made imme|diately after the battle of Cannae: and their &s;enate (venal as Carthage then was) would not have been &s;o lo&s;t to every patri|otic &s;entiment as to have &s;anctioned its ratification. Britain, on the day of the &s;ignature of the treaty, was involved in a war with the brave&s;t people in Europe; in the whole cour&s;e of this war, &s;he had experienced continued defeats and di&s;graces; her trea&s;ures were wa&s;ted upon allies that either de&s;erted or were too feeble to afford her effectual aid; her debt had grown to the enormous &s;um of three hundred millions; her navy could only be manned by the mo&s;t de&s;tructive burdens upon her commerce; her manufactures were langui&s;hing, her fleets were unable to protect her trade, which had &s;uffered unexampled lo&s;&s;es. And while &s;he was &s;inking under her burdens, her antagoni&s;t was con&s;olidating her government, and growing &s;o rapidly in &s;trength, reputation, and vigor, as to threaten her exi&s;tence as a nation. The United States were, on the other hand, in the highe&s;t pro&s;perity; their nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bers had doubled &s;ince they had &s;ucce&s;sfully mea&s;ured &s;words with Britain; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed men, arms, military &s;tores, and an ally, who was alone too powerful for her enemies. Sweden and Denmark, who had received in&s;ults from Britain, were ready to make a common cau&s;e with her; and as the marine of England and France were nearly balanc|ed, the weight of America, had &s;he been forced into the war, would have turned the &s;cale, and have completed the ruin of the Briti&s;h commerce, without any other effort than that of granting letters of marque. Independent of which, without the violation of their neutrality, by tho&s;e acts of &s;overeignty which no one would di&s;pute their right to exerci&s;e, they could involve the Briti&s;h trade in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, by an additional duty on Briti&s;h tonnage, by granting advantages to rival ma|nufactures, by retaining debts due to her merchants, till the in|juries ours had &s;u&s;tained were compen&s;ated. By following her example, both in the pre&s;ent and in the late American war, and &s;uffering no part of the public debt to be paid to her citi|zens, till ju&s;tice was done us, we could have forced her into
<PB N="116" REF="028389_0115_0FD8E7DA5215CA90">any mea&s;ure that it was ju&s;t or proper for us to a&s;k. And indeed, &s;o fully &s;atisfied were the Americans, of every party, on the &s;uperiority of our &s;ituation, that no doubt was enter|tained of a favorable i&s;&s;ue to Mr. Jay's negociation; and all that his friends lamented, and his enemies rejoiced in, was, that the principal credit of them would be a&s;cribed rather to the victories of France, than to the addre&s;s of our mini&s;ter. Under the&s;e happy au&s;pices the negociation began: we &s;hall proceed to &s;ee how it concluded.</P>
<P>The next point of enquiry is into the objects of the negoti|ation; for as every treaty is an abridgment of the natural freedom of nations, no wi&s;e &s;tate ever enters into one, but with a view to remove &s;ome evil, or acquire &s;ome advantage. It is upon this ground, that many of our mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed patriots have been of opinion, that all commercial treaties were injurious trammels and bargains, in which we might probably be over|reached at the moment, or which circum&s;tances might them after render inconvenient; that America having nothing to &s;ell but articles of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to the nations with which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deals, and affording a market to their manufactures, her ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trade laws were her be&s;t treaties; &s;ince &s;he may alter and mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> them at plea&s;ure: and, indeed, experience has ju&s;tified the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> opinion: independent of the depredations we have &s;uffered fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the war, our trade enjoyed every advantage that we could re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;onably wi&s;h. A commercial treaty was not the object of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion; the Briti&s;h nation in direct violation of the treaty of Paris, refu&s;ed to &s;urrender the we&s;tern po&s;ts; extended the limits of their juri&s;diction, availed them&s;elves of their &s;itu|ation to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Indian trade, and &s;timulated the &s;avages to ravage our frontier: Briti&s;h officers ever accompanying them in their incur&s;ions, it became the dignity of the nation to demand a <HI>delivery</HI> of the po&s;ts&mdash;<HI>reparation</HI> for the lo&s;s of trade&mdash;a <HI>com|pen&s;ation</HI> for the expence of the war the Briti&s;h had excited with the Indians&mdash;a <HI>public</HI> puni&s;hment of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who had per&s;onally appeared in arms again&s;t us, with the remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al from office of Lord Dorche&s;ter, who had, in his addre&s;s to the Indians, encouraged them to violate the treaty of peace. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Jay was thought the propere&s;t per&s;on to make this demand&punc; Let us &s;ee how far he has ju&s;tified that &s;entiment, in fulfilling his duty with re&s;pect to this &s;ingle point.</P>
<P>By the 2d article of the treaty, the Briti&s;h promi&s;e to eva|cuate the We&s;tern Po&s;ts by the 1&s;t of June, 1796. By the treaty of Paris, in 1783, they promi&s;ed to evacuate with all con|venient &s;peed, which, if we may judge by the &s;peed with which they have found it convenient to evacuate all their po&s;ts in
<PB N="117" REF="028389_0116_0FD8E7DBCD34B8D8">France, Flanders, Germany, Holland, and Brabant, one would have &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t have meant a much &s;horter time than eigh|teen months; &s;o that all that the treaty acquires with re&s;pect to the po&s;ts, is le&s;s than we were entitled to, by the treaty of Paris. Surely we might expect better &s;ecurity than a mere promi&s;e from a nation which has already &s;hown, in their violation of the pa&s;t, the little reliance that can be placed on their future, engagements. By June, 1796, it is not improbable that our &s;ituation, or that of Britain, may be changed; what &s;ecurity &s;hall we then have for the performance of the treaty? It is &s;aid, as has been already &s;aid (by tho&s;e apologi&s;ts who&s;e arguments &s;eem determined to find every mini&s;terial mea&s;ure right) that every treaty is a promi&s;e, and that if we are not to rely upon a promi&s;e, there can be no treaties.&mdash;I an&s;wer, that it is the practice of negociators, where the character of the nation, or other circum&s;tances, give rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a violation of their engagements, <HI>not to rely</HI> upon a naked promi&s;e, but to expect &s;ome guarantee or &s;urety for the performance; that in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, as the promi&s;e was evidently extorted by the pre&s;&s;ure of exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, we &s;hould &s;ee to the performance while tho&s;e circum&s;tances continue to exi&s;t. It is evident, before Mr. Jay left this country, that the Briti&s;h were &s;o far from intending to evacuate the po&s;ts, that they had determined to extend their limits; this may not only be inferred from all the encouragement they gave to the depredations of the Indians, but undeniably proved by Lord Dorche&s;ter's &s;peech, which, though di&s;avowed by Dund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, is now admitted to have been made in con&s;equence of expre&s;s in&s;tructions. The promi&s;e, then, to evacuate, has been extorted by French victories, by the humiliation of the Briti&s;h nation, and by their apprehen&s;ion, that we might, at la&s;t, be provoked to do our&s;elves ju&s;tice, while they were embarra&s;&s;ed with France. Surely, then, the evacua|tion &s;hould have been in&s;i&s;ted upon, while the&s;e circum&s;tances operated with full force;&mdash;what was there to impede an imme|diate evacuation of O&s;wego, which is only occupied by a lieu|tenant's command? what was to prevent our troops being put in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Niagara and the upper po&s;ts, under an engagement to protect, for a limited time, the Briti&s;h pro|perty that remained there? In one week this might have been effected, con&s;idering the &s;ituation of the po&s;ts, upon navigable waters, as well as in one year.&mdash;May we not rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;e, that the Briti&s;h &s;till entertain a hope, that peace between them and France, di&s;&s;entions between the United States and that Republic, the &s;eeds of which are &s;o plentifully &s;own by the treaty it&s;elf, may enable them to violate their &s;econd, with the
<PB N="118" REF="028389_0117_0FD8E7E1A1049F18">&s;ame impunity that they have their fir&s;t engagement. If the &s;uppo&s;ed non-performance of the treaty of Paris (which, how|ever, has been &s;o ably refuted by Mr. Jeffer&s;on in his corre&s;pon|dence with Mr. Hammond on that &s;ubject; has hitherto &s;erve them as a pretext for retaining the po&s;ts; how many &s;uch pretence mu&s;t the complexity and ob&s;curity of the pre&s;ent treaty afford&punc; But &s;uppo&s;e the war with France to continue, &s;uppo&s;e they have the magnanimity to forgive our predilection for the ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;pirit of our own nation to get the better of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;graceful &s;tupor into which a venal &s;y&s;tem has lulled it&mdash;&s;up|po&s;e the increa&s;ing imbecility of Britain &s;hall forbid her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for impunity in a further breach of faith, will it &s;till be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ter of little moment, whether or not &s;he retains garri&s;ons in the mid&s;t of our territory for twelve months longer or not? are we not at this moment at war with the &s;avages? is not this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attended with much expen&s;e to the nation, and much private di&s;tre&s;s? is not the blood of our citizens daily &s;hed? the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t continue as long as the po&s;ts are in the hands of the Briti&s;h; or a peace, if practicable, mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> United States at very con&s;iderable expen&s;e: were we to e&s;timate the difference in this point of view, between an imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> evacuation, and one that is to take place in June 1796, it would certainly not fall &s;hort of one million of dollars, independen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the de&s;truction of our fellow citizens, who&s;e lives are beyond all price.&mdash;If to this we add the annual profits of the Indian trade, amounting to 800, 000, it will appear that the United States lo&s;e near two millions of dollars, by the retention of the po&s;ts, &s;uppo&s;ing (which is at lea&s;t problematical) that they &s;hall be &s;urrendered at the period propo&s;ed.

<P>But was the evacuation of the po&s;ts all we had a right to a&s;k on that &s;ubject; if the retention of them occa&s;ioned tho&s;e expen&s;ive Indian wars which have &s;o often drained our trea&s;ury and thinned our ranks.&mdash;If, for 12 years, we have lo&s;t thereby a lucrative branch of commerce, are we entitled to no compen|&s;ation for the&s;e lo&s;&s;es? If the honor of the nation has been in&s;ulted, both by lord Dorche&s;ter and the &s;ubjects of Great Britain under his command, are we to expect no reparation for the&s;e in&s;ults? Have we rea&s;on, from what we have &s;een of Mr. Jay's corre&s;pondence with Lord Grenville, to pre&s;ume that any has been a&s;ked? are we not a&s;&s;ured that none has been ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed?

<P>THE next tran&s;action of the treaty of Paris, for which we were entitled to compen&s;ation, is that by which they en|gaged not to carry off negroes or other property. To enforce this &s;tipulation, the commander in chief, by the order of con|gre&s;s, &s;ent colonel Smith and Mr. Ben&s;on to New York; who, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent property to a con&s;iderable amount from being &s;hipped, took an account of &s;o much as came to their knowledge.&mdash;What &s;atisfaction has Mr. Jay pro|cured to the United States for this lo&s;s? Are commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="120" REF="028389_0119_0FD8E7E71C85F0E0">appointed by <HI>choice</HI> or by <HI>chance,</HI> for the liquidation of the&s;e accounts? Has the Briti&s;h government rendered it&s;elf liable for them? When Mr. Jay was &s;o &s;olicitous to &s;ecure to the Bri|ti&s;h merchants every item of their demands, with intere&s;t and <HI>damages,</HI> would it not have been proper to have reflected upon tho&s;e his country might claim?</P>
<P>The third demand, and perhaps the be&s;t founded of any made by a free country, was that which rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, not merely to the violation of our flag, nor to a point of national honor only, nor to the infraction of treaties, or the withholding our ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tories, but to what is infinitely dearer than either, to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;onal liberty of our citizens. Before Mr. Jay left this country, it had been the common practice of the Briti&s;h to pre&s;s Ame|rican &s;eamen, not only from our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, but in the very harbour of London, and with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed contempt did they treat us, that the government not only winked at it, but their judiciary, in defiance of their own laws, authorized it. A &s;eaman having found means (a matter of no &s;mall difficulty when in the hands of a pre&s;s-gang) to procure a habeas corp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, the captain of the &s;hip of war returned on the writ, that he was a Briti&s;h &s;ubject; and though the &s;eaman had certificate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and witne&s;&s;es to prove that he was an American citizen, the judge refu&s;ed to admit them, and declared that the captain's return was conclu&s;ive evidence; from which time to the pre&s;ent moment, it has been the common practice of the &s;hips of war, even within &s;ight of our own harbours, to tear that valuable cla&s;s of citizens from their dome&s;tic enjoyments, from the bo|&s;om of their families, to be &s;ubject to military di&s;cipline and impri&s;onment. By a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e mea&s;ures, we withhold that protection which is due to every citizen, and which indeed is the great end of government. We man the fleets of the enemy of our ally; di&s;able our merchants from availing them&s;elves of all the advantages we might derive from our neutrality, and ju&s;tify our &s;eamen in quitting a country in which they have no &s;ecurity, even for per&s;onal liberty, to &s;eek it in foreign &s;ervice.&mdash;Of this re&s;ource, however, Mr. Jay has endeavoured to deprive them. Surely it would have been his duty, when he was con&s;igning &s;uch as went into the &s;ervice of our ally, to an infamous death, to have obtained &s;ome &s;atisfac|tion for the wrongs they had &s;uffered while under the protection of their national flag: yet upon this &s;ubject the treaty is wholly &s;ilent. Perhaps the envoy extraordinary believed, that any &s;ti|pulation in their favor, would have derogated from his a&s;&s;ertion, that America relied <HI>&s;olely</HI> on the ju&s;tice and magnanimity of his Britannic maje&s;ty.</P>

This article not only de&s;erves con&s;ideration, as forming a &s;triking contra&s;t to our &s;hamele&s;s indifference for the injuries and in&s;ults our own officers and men have actually received, but as laying the foundation for future differences with Great Britain, whenever &s;he &s;hall find it convenient to deny us &s;ome &s;tipulated right, under pretence that the treaty has been violated.

<P>A MOTION was made to have the treaty read, which was done: it was then moved to di&s;cu&s;s, and pa&s;s upon, the teaty, article by article&mdash;this motion was objected to, becau&s;e the &s;ubject had been &s;o fully and &s;o publicly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the members had had &s;o much time to &s;tudy the treaty, and deli|berately to form their opinion, that every one mu&s;t be ready for the que&s;tion&mdash;it was therefore di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>A motion was then made in the words following, viz.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of the chamber, That the recom|mendation of the &s;enate to the pre&s;ident of the United States, to ratify the treaty, as amended by them, was wi&s;e and, pru|dent; becau&s;e it &s;ettles, in a fair and amicable manner, points of difference between the two nations, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject our country to a humiliating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Briti&s;h impo&s;itions and injuries, or induce a war, with all its horrors and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to &s;eek redre&s;s; and becau&s;e, when con|&s;idered collectively, the tendency of the treaty mu&s;t be to pro|mote and extend, rather than to injure and re&s;train, our com|merce.</P>
<P>This motion gave ri&s;e to a lengthy and free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the object at large, after which the que&s;tion was put by the pre&s;i|dent, when the &s;ame was adopted with one diffentient only.</P>
<P>Another motion was then made in the words following, viz:</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, therefore, That the chamber cannot but lament and di&s;approve every attempt to excite an oppo&s;ition to the treaty, in the minds of the people, and to detach their con&s;i|dence

And though they feel a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, in the firm belief, that the executive of the United States coincides in opinion with them; yet, as the &s;ituation of the head of that department, under the particular circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, may wi&s;h for the general &s;entiment of his fellow citizens, before an exerci&s;e of his own judgment on &s;o important a &s;ub|ject, is finally made; a judgment, not to be recalled by him or us, without the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences, perhaps, en&s;uing; they therefore proceed to &s;tate their opinion thereon.</P>

<P>THE committee appointed by their fellow citizens to take into con&s;ideration and arrange their objections again&s;t a certain treaty between plenipotentiaries of the United States and his Britannic maje&s;ty, &s;igned on the 10th of November, 1794, Report,</P>
<P>That reciprocal benefit and mutual advantage are the only proper inducements for national negociations, and ought to be the ba&s;is of all treaties between &s;overeign and independent nations.</P>
<P>That the objects which pre&s;ented them&s;elves for a negociation with Great Britain, at the time when Mr. Jay was appointed to that mi&s;&s;ion, were in their nature truly intere&s;ting to the ju&s;tice, honor and happine&s;s, of the United States; among which we con&s;ider the procuring a compliance with the treaty of peace, obtaining compen&s;ation for recent &s;poliations on the property of American merchants, and preventing future repe|titions of &s;uch injuries, as the mo&s;t important. That, by the treaty above referred to, neither of the&s;e objects has been accom|pli&s;hed,
<PB N="135" REF="028389_0134_0FD8E8141A5E1388">nor has any political or commercial benefit in favor of the United States been attained; but on the contrary, a variety of conce&s;&s;ions have been made to Great Britain, in violation of the treaty of 1783, and of our engagements with France and other nations, in &s;ubver&s;ion of the rights of the people, and if ratified, to the eternal di&s;grace and reproach of our govern|ment.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid treaty is calculated to contravene the acts of ba|ni&s;hments and attainder, pa&s;&s;ed during the late American war, and to authorize the return of all per&s;ons included in them, with|out any condition, although that power is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the legulatures of the re&s;pective &s;tates.</P>
<P>That, by the treaty of peace, the right of property of the north we&s;tern territory within the boundaries de&s;ignated therein, was ve&s;ted in the United States; and had that treaty been com|plied with, would, long ago, have been di&s;po&s;ed of for their u&s;e: that the treaty lately made, whil&s;t it nece&s;&s;arily implies an aggre&s;|&s;ion, or at lea&s;t a failure on the part of Great Britain, provides, not only an indemnity, but al&s;o, at our expen&s;e, a compen&s;a|tion to her &s;ubjects, and clogs the &s;urrender of an acknowledged right, withheld for eleven years, with provi&s;ions tending to le&s;&s;en the value of &s;uch &s;urrender. This article and the next prove that Great Britain has &s;o contrived the pre&s;ent treaty as to part with nothing on this head, even after the 1&s;t of June, 1796, but the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and expen&s;e of the po&s;ts in que&s;tion. By the &s;tipulation in &s;avor of her &s;ettlers, whether they remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves as American citizens, it is evident the profits of their trade will centre in Great Britain, and the connections and influence continue as exten&s;ive as ever with the Indian tribes; two objects appearing to your committee of more importance than the mere occupation of the ground; be&s;ides, as, from the nature of this trade, and the manner of carrying it on, there will be abundant opportunity, &s;o there can be little doubt that (in a people &s;o recently leagued in war with the &s;avages again&s;t us) there will be &s;ufficient inclination to de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd the American revenue.</P>
<P>That it gives to the &s;ubjects of a foreign nation the uncontro|lable power and night of pa&s;&s;ing through the territory of the United States; a privilege which is contrary to the policy of all nations: that the navigation of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, although a right of the United States which cannot be q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tioned, may not be brought into operation without great difficulty and ex|pen&s;e; and that therefore a participation of it ought not to have been &s;tipulated for, without &s;ome reciprocal obligation, by which the beneficial effect of this right would have been pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed
<PB N="136" REF="028389_0135_0FD8E816ED6DE5E8">that, by our exclu&s;ion from the ports within the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay company, the advantages of the Indian trade will be confined to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects: that it provides for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a tribunal unknown to, and in violation of, the con&s;ti|tution, which will have the power of reviewing the deci&s;ions of our courts, con&s;titutionally made, and of impeaching the ju&s;tice and legality of tho&s;e d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci&s;ions; the fifth commi&s;&s;ioner is to be elected by lot, and upon this principle, we conceive it is to be determined by chance, merely, whether the United States are to be encumbered with the payment of large &s;ums of money to Briti&s;h merchants, and to an unlimited amount. Your com|mittee view this article as the more unwarrantable and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ce&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e they are confident that in this &s;tate no legal impediments have been created again&s;t the recovery of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> due to Briti&s;h creditors &s;ince the treaty of 1783, but that, on the contrary, the courts of the United States have for &s;everal years pa&s;t been in con&s;tant and active operation, for the pur|po&s;e of enforcing the recovery of their demands, without an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> equitable allowance for the hard&s;hips and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the war, or even for lo&s;&s;es wantonly occa&s;ioned by the government and &s;ubjects of that nation. That, on the other hand, legal impe|diments have been created again&s;t the recovery of debts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> American citizens in Great Britain, of which the celebrates ca&s;e, Nut ver&s;us Wright, is one among many in&s;tances which might be cited.</P>
<P>It is entirely &s;ilent on that important &s;ubject, the re&s;toration of negroes, and other property carried from this continent by the Briti&s;h troops, in direct violation of the treaty of 1783, is the di&s;appointment, and, in many in&s;tances, ruin of the un|fortunate citizens of the United States, who have &s;uffered by this unwarrantable mea&s;ure; whereas the Briti&s;h government and courts of law, where attempts have been made to recover by that means, have repeatedly held out a&s;&s;urances of com|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>We con&s;ider that part of the treaty which makes pro|vi&s;ion for compen&s;ating the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by citizens of the re&s;pective parties, by means of illegal &s;poliations, as manife&s;tly and gro&s;sly unequal and partial, and that, &s;o far as it re&s;pects American citizens, it is altogether ineffectual, on their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s no application can be made to the commi&s;&s;ioners until it &s;hall have been a&s;certained, by going through a tedious cour&s;e of judicial proceeding, whether any remedy can be obtained in that way: then the applications and proofs mu&s;t be produced in Great Britain; whereas Briti&s;h &s;ubjects may apply immedi|ately it home, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eve compen&s;ation, although the courts of
<PB N="137" REF="028389_0136_0FD8E817D1B5C488">admiralty of the United States have been, and are con&s;tantly open to compel re&s;titution where it is has appeared that captures of Briti&s;h property have been illegally made.</P>
<P>It provides for the &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty of every de&s;cription, without regard to bani&s;hed per&s;ons, to hold lands in the territories of the United States in like manner as if they were natives; and at the &s;ame time holds out that American citizens may do the &s;ame in her dominions, where it is well known that, by the Engli&s;h laws, aliens are incapacitated from holding real e&s;tates; and the comparative quantity of lands held by the citizens of the one power and &s;ubjects of the other, bears no manner of proportion.</P>
<P>The privilege offered by this treaty of trading to the We&s;t Indies is &s;o limited as to the burden of ve&s;&s;els, that it can af|ford little or no benefit; it leaves all the advantages &s;ubject to the controul of exi&s;ting and future legi&s;lative re&s;trictions and prohibitions: Even this paltry privilege is rendered of very &s;mall u&s;e to American merchants, by their being po&s;itively re&s;tricted from exporting the produce of the We&s;t Indies to any part of the world in their own ve&s;&s;els; and, in exchange for this pretended advantage, the treaty has relinqui&s;hed the right of exporting cotton, the growth of our own &s;oil, and one of the mo&s;t important &s;taples of the &s;outhern &s;tates, in American ve&s;&s;els to foreign ports.</P>
<P>Your committee deem it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve fully on the article relating to the We&s;t India trade, although its operation is &s;u&s;pended by the &s;enate; and they cannot forbear to remark, that this article, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the privilege of trading with &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, is the only one in that treaty which con|tains the &s;malle&s;t appearance of benefit to the United States.</P>
<P>It therefore appears to your committe extraordinary that the repre&s;entatives of the people in &s;enate, in&s;tead of rejecting this unequal and unrighteous contract altogether, have ratified every part except the 12th article, in con&s;equence of which, every other article may be enforced, and this may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llifiea, whereby the object of the We&s;t India trade will be put en|tirely out of view.</P>
<P>It appears to your committee that the clau&s;e which re&s;trains the congre&s;s of the United States from increa&s;ing the tonnage of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, is calculated to &s;uppre&s;s the American revenue, is an infringement of a con&s;titutional right, and will induce the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;training the obnoxious mea&s;ure of direct taxation to an impolitic degree.</P>
<P>We find that the &s;aid treaty, in&s;tead of preventing any further &s;poliations, on our property by the Briti&s;h, contains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="138" REF="028389_0137_0FD8E81C11461A98">provi&s;ion calculated to promote repetitions of tho&s;e injuries.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks on the IId Article of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>BY the 2d article of Mr. Jay's treaty, the &s;ettlers and traders within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts, now held by the Briti&s;h within the boundary lines of the United States, may remove, with all their effects; they may &s;ell their lands, hou&s;es, or effects, or retain the property thereof, at their di&s;cretion. Such of them as &s;hall continue to re&s;ide within tho&s;e boundary lines, may remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects if they choo&s;e, or become citizens of the United States&mdash;in the latter ca&s;e they are bound to take the oath of allegiance.</P>
<P>The enemies of the treaty have endeavored to excite an alarm, under the pretence, that as the limits of the precincts or juri&s;|diction of tho&s;e po&s;ts are not defined, the &s;ame may reach to va&s;t extents of country, throughout which are or may be planted, even <HI>colonies</HI> of people devoted to the intere&s;t of Great Britain. But nothing can be more unfounded.</P>
<P>The po&s;ts withheld, contrary to the treaty of peace, are two on Lake Champlain, in the &s;tate of Vermont; one perhaps at O&s;wegatchie; and tho&s;e of O&s;wego, Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackanac.</P>
<P>All the&s;e po&s;ts are <HI>military &s;tations,</HI> either without any Briti&s;h &s;ettlers about them, or with but a few families, except the po&s;t of Detroit. Detroit was originally &s;ettled by the French. The attention of the inhabitants was devoted to the Indian trade; and con&s;equently they cultivated very little land. By the peace of 1763, Detroit, with all Canada, was ceded to Great Bri|tain. Since that time a few American, Engli&s;h, Scotch, and Iri&s;h &s;ettlers and traders, have joined the old French inhabitants: but Detroit &s;till remains an incon&s;iderable village. The &s;ettlers within its juri&s;diction are chiefly planted along the border of the river: but their &s;ettlements are of &s;uch &s;mall extent, and &s;o little land has been cultivated, that they have not been able to furni&s;h a &s;urplus of provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to &s;eed its &s;mall garri&s;on of two or three hundred men. For the con&s;umption of the&s;e few troops, flour has been &s;ent from the United States and Lower Canada, and pork from Ireland.</P>
<P>What, then, can be the "juri&s;diction" of this po&s;t? Com|mon &s;en&s;e would &s;uppo&s;e it of very &s;mall extent; that it was co-exten&s;ive with the &s;ettlers; and, in the utmo&s;t latitude, comprehended no more of the land at and about Detroit, than belonged to them at the &s;ignature of the treaty. The re&s;t of the
<PB N="144" REF="028389_0143_0FD8E82D429B09B8">country belongs to the Indians; who, though hitherto under the <HI>influence,</HI> can in no &s;en&s;e be &s;aid to be within the <HI>jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;diction</HI> of Detroit.</P>
<P>To form a ju&s;t idea of the po&s;&s;ible extent of the landed pro|perty of the&s;e people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t will be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aty of peace between us and Great Britain. By that treaty, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">troit became a part of the United States; and had we then gamed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, its inhabitants would doubtle&s;s have been con|&s;idered as citizens. Or if any pre&s;erved remaining Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, they mu&s;t have been debarred all the privilege&punc; of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">|ship. But whether citizens or Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aty of peace &s;ecured to them all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nded and other property, and Mr. Jay's treaty does no more. Will it be &s;aid, that &s;ince the treaty of peace they may have purcha&s;ed immen&s;e tracts of land of the Indians; and that the&s;e al&s;o will be held under Mr. Jay's treaty? The idea is perfectly groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>By the 1&s;t article of the treaty of peace, Great Britain cedes and relinqui&s;hes to the United States, "all claim to the govern|ment, <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>territorial</HI> rights of the &s;ame, and every part thereof," con&s;equently, the lands of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects within the precincts or juri&s;diction of Detroit, and any other Briti&s;h po&s;ts within the territory of the United States, can be of no greater extent <HI>now,</HI> than they were at the treaty of peace. If the king of Great Britain, or any of his governors of officers, have &s;ince made grants of lands within the boundaries of the United States (a thing not probable) &s;uch grants are mere nul|lities. The lands &s;o attempted to be granted, being by that treaty the ab&s;olute property of the United States, the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects could not afterwards acquire any property in them; and con&s;e|quently they cannot hold them by Mr. Jay's treaty.</P>
<P>One word concerning the inhabitants of Detroit. They are chiefly <HI>French,</HI> with whom it is to be pre&s;umed we &s;hall find no difficulty in <HI>fraternizing;</HI> and of the others, whether originally Americans or Engli&s;h, Scotch or Iri&s;h, many, and probably the majority, are already well di&s;po&s;ed towards the United States, and eager to enjoy all the advantages of our free govern|ment and citizen&s;h. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;mall remnant; &s;ome of them ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the line; and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the purpo&s;es of trade at Detroit.

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 122.]</P>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING touched upon the demand, which, under the treaty, we are entitled to make for the lo&s;s of property carried off, I have &s;ince examined official documents, to wit, the letter of the commander in. chief, and the report of our commi&s;&s;ioners, from which it may be fairly e&s;timated, at about one million of dollars. As this was the fir&s;t infraction of the treaty, and made without the &s;lighte&s;t pretence, there can be no doubt of the ju&s;tice of our demand, as well for intere&s;t as prin|cipal, which would rai&s;e the aggregate amount to about one million &s;even hundred thou&s;and dollars. Is it not very extraor|dinary that Mr. Jay &s;hould neglect an object of &s;o much mo|ment, while he was &s;o &s;edulous in loading the United States with the private debts of Briti&s;h merchants? If (which there is the be&s;t founded rea&s;on to deny) there is really any thing due on that &s;core, &s;urely no better fund can be conceived for its di&s;charge than this well-authenticated claim upon the Briti&s;h government. What makes this omi&s;&s;ion the more extraordinary, is, that the pre&s;ident, while commander in chief, congre&s;s in the year 1783, and at various periods &s;ince, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on very lately, have uniformly treated this article as very important, in&s;i&s;ted upon its fulfilment, and procured &s;uch authentic documents of its amount, as to leave Britain without the &s;malle&s;t apology for its inexecution.</P>
<P>The next object of Mr. Jay's negociation was to obtain &s;atis|faction for the in&s;ults our national flag had &s;u&s;tained, and re|dre&s;s for the injuries done our trade in violation of the laws of nations. The&s;e may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Acts autho|tized and ordered by the court of St. James's.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Acts done by individuals <HI>under colour,</HI> but in abu&s;e, of tho&s;e orders.</ITEM>
</LIST> The fir&s;t cla&s;s mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, govern the deci&s;ions of their maritime courts, which, though profe&s;&s;ing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aled by the laws of na|tions, always take the direction of the &s;overeign as the expo&s;itor of tho&s;e laws. Thus, when Mr. Pitt &s;eized, in time of profound peace, all French ve&s;&s;els, and thereby outraged every principl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of natural law, the Briti&s;h courts of admiralty found no diffi|culty in condemning them. When, in the &s;ame was, to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="148" REF="028389_0147_0FD8E836962288D0">the Dutch from availing them&s;elves of their neutrality, to acquire the carrying trade, he made prize of every &s;hip loaded with French produce, the courts of admiralty condemned them without he&s;itation, and ju&s;tified their conduct by the orders they had received. Indeed it would be a &s;oleci&s;m to &s;ay, that the king ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rame in&s;tructions, and give orders for making prizes, and that his courts have power to over-rule tho&s;e orders, and puni&s;h the &s;ubject that obeys them; &s;ince it mu&s;t often happen, that the intere&s;t of the &s;tate may ju&s;tify a breach of the code of nations, without its being proper to communicate to the ordinary courts the principles upon which this ju&s;tification is formed. Accordingly, we find it the con&s;tant practice what a new edict is i&s;&s;ued, to &s;end it to the maritime courts as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rule for their conduct in determining of prize or no prize. And the courts of appeal in prize ca&s;es con&s;i&s;t of commi&s;&s;ioners of appeal, of whom a majority mu&s;t be privy coun&s;ellors (22 Gen.

<P>The above enumerated evils were the effect of the expre&s;s act, and emanated from the &s;pecial authority, of the Briti&s;h govern|ment.

But the number of the&s;e were comparatively &s;mall; and for the&s;e courts of adjudication were always open; and yet, by a mo&s;t ex|traordinary fatality, Mr. Jay overlooks all the&s;e flagrant injuries committed by the Briti&s;h king again&s;t the United States <HI>as a nation,</HI> and for which they are without remedy, but by a nati|onal compen&s;ation, and neither a&s;ks nor procures any redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The nature of Mr. Jay's application is explained in his courtly note to Lord Grenville. This contains no complaint of any of the in&s;tructions I have alluded to, or any other, expre&s;&s;ive of the injury that one <HI>nation</HI> had done to the other, but merely in the

Through the whole of this note, he &s;peaks of nothing further than individual compen&s;ation for indi|vidual injury, leaving the two nations entirely out of &s;ight as nations; and indeed if he had intended any thing more, if he had had the in&s;tructions I have mentioned, in view, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to have made u&s;e of &s;o many p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e|gyrics on the <HI>ju&s;tice and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">anity</HI> of his Britannic maje&s;ty.

<P>The 7th article exactly pur&s;ues the principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in the note, to wit, that the United States are entitled to no re|compen&s;e; that the government of Great Britain has done us no injury, and that "divers merchants and others" only have to complain of the irregularity of &s;ome captures and condem|nations, which it &s;uppo&s;es the courts of admiralty are, for the mo&s;t part, competent to decide upon. But that if it &s;hould hap|pen, that there are any lo&s;&s;es for which adequate compen&s;ation cannot be obtained, provided that the party claiming has been guilty of no neglect or delay, &s;uch compen&s;ation &s;hall be a&s;cer|tained by commi&s;&s;ioners, and his Britannic maje&s;ty engages to pay them. As this article &s;ays nothing about opening the courts, it mu&s;t have been under&s;tood by both parties, that they were nece&s;&s;arily open, independent of the treaty; &s;o that all the ad|vantage, if any, that may re&s;ult from appeals, were rights that individuals in every civilized nation may claim, and which ma|ny
<PB N="151" REF="028389_0150_0FD8E83D4CF2AAB0">had exerci&s;ed before Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion. In this re&s;pect, then, nothing was effected by his negociation, unle&s;s it was, that the time for bringing appeals is &s;aid to have been enlarg|ed; but of this, the treaty &s;ays nothing; this too, mu&s;t there|fore, depend upon the will of the king of Great Britain, or on the rules his courts chu&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. All that Mr. Jay has then done in this important bu&s;ine&s;s, that involved the honor of his country, the great intere&s;ts of its commerce, the rights and liberties of its citizens, and the property of individuals, many of whom have been ruined by the lo&s;s of their capital, is to obtain <HI>a promi&s;e</HI> of compen&s;ation in &s;uch ca&s;es as are &s;o &s;in|gularly circum&s;tanced as not to be within the reach of legal re|dre&s;s. When we come to view this article, &s;tripped of its unne|ce&s;&s;ary verbiage, it will appear to mock with delu&s;ive hopes, the men that it affects to relieve. Let us enquire what is to be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and of what nature and kind the cau&s;es that are to come before them.</P>

The great cau&s;e of complaint, <HI>the in&s;tructions,</HI> which are the laws of the court of admiralty, not being complained of, all condemnations fairly made under them, mu&s;t be con|firmed by the treaty.

<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P N="2">2d. That if, in addition to this, he has advantages in the tran&s;portation of his goods&mdash;in the &s;ale of the commodities he purcha&s;es&mdash;and in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of factories&mdash;he mu&s;t ruin all competitors. By the treaty of peace, our boundaries are fixed, and the Briti&s;h are to evacuate our territory without any &s;tipulation, whatever, in favor of Briti&s;h merchants or traders; by this treaty, therefore, &s;o much of the fur and peltry trade, at lea&s;t as lay within our own territory, was nece&s;&s;arily and exclu&s;ively ours; as we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the po&s;ts at which the trade had been carried on for a century pa&s;t, and mo&s;t of the port|ages. As our communication from the &s;ea was much ea&s;ier than by the St. Lawrence, we could furni&s;h Engli&s;h goods cheaper, and, of cour&s;e, would have continued the Indian trade in its u&s;ual channel, even from the Briti&s;h &s;ides of the lakes, nor could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, by any means, have prevented it, without giving &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t to the Indians as would have made them dangerous neighbours.</P>
<P>Lord Grenville's treaty with Mr. Jay &s;tipulates, that the Briti&s;h traders may continue to live at our po&s;ts; to hold the property they po&s;&s;e&s;s; to trade in every p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of our territory as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly as our own citizens; and to navigate our rivers <HI>from the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> as high as our own citizens may, that is, to the highe&s;t port of entry, and from thence to navigate our inland waters. It mu&s;t follow, then, that under the&s;e cirum&s;tances, they &s;tand exactly upon the &s;ame footing with our own citizens. It will al&s;o be admitted, that having been for twelve years in the ex|clu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Indian trade&mdash;having, in general, much larger capitals&mdash;having an exten&s;ive acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">aintance among the Indian nations, and with the Canadians, who are the general carriers in that country, American traders will not be able to maintain a competition with them, even if they had no other
<PB N="154" REF="028389_0153_0FD8E84060BD2A20">advantages than tho&s;e I have enumerated. But this, unhappily, is far from being the ca&s;e; fir&s;t, they have, of cour&s;e, a right to &s;ettle factories in every part of their own territory; their factors being always upon the &s;pot, and cultivating an acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ance with the natives, will certainly be able to command the trade of their country, and thus render ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s the &s;tipulation which admits American traders <HI>to travel into</HI> that territory; for it is ob&s;ervable, that the navigation act, 12 Charles II. chap. 18, which is pre&s;erved in full force, by the 14th article of the treaty, prevents our e&s;tabli&s;hing any factory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> trading hou&s;e, or re&s;iding as merchant-factors within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ti&s;h territories, <HI>out of Europe;</HI> while the treaty permits the Briti&s;h to <HI>re&s;ide</HI> in any part of the United States; to hire and po&s;&s;e&s;s hou&s;es and ware-hou&s;es for the purpo&s;e of commerce, &amp;c. &s;o that while, by this means, they have an exclu&s;ive trade in their own territory, not with&s;tanding the apparent grant of a right to us, they have all the advantages our citizens enjoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ours, with tho&s;e they have acquired from large capitals, know|ledge of the trade, &amp;c. Our trader may, indeed, travel, like a pedlar, through their country with his &s;hop upon his back; but cannot have any fixed re&s;idence at which to open a &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.

<P>This exclu&s;ive trade in their own country, by means of the factories they may e&s;tabli&s;h, gives them another con&s;iderable advantage; it is well known to merchants, that the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ten&s;ive any branch of commerce is, the le&s;s liable to interrup|tions, the more profitable it mu&s;t be, and of cour&s;e, the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it enables the trader to under&s;ell his competitors.

This again mu&s;t rea|der the competition very unequal.</P>

I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have yet to learn, that any Ea&s;t India arti|cles con&s;umed by the Indians, on the north of the lakes, will exceed one hundred dollars a year; perhaps the writer means, that the inhabitants of Canada will receive them through this channel; if we &s;hould even admit this, which, however, we &s;hall be able to &s;how is highly improbable, yet it would appear a very in&s;ignificant advantage, when we reflect that the whole number of inhabitants in Canada, and Labrador, as appears by a cen&s;us, taken by General Haldiman, amounted, in 1784, including Upper Canada, to only 123, 082 &s;ouls: but few of the&s;e are in the habit of drinking any tea, and all are too poor to con&s;ume any but the coar&s;e&s;t articles; &s;o that the whole con|&s;umption of Canada, in India goods, if we had a monopoly of that trade, would fall &s;hort of what is con&s;umed in the little &s;tate of New Jer&s;ey; and we &s;hould certainly make a mi&s;erable exchange, if for this we &s;acrifice a branch of commerce of &s;uch immen&s;e importance, as the Indian trade.</P>
<P>But what can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;uppo&s;e that articles which come duty-free from Britain (a drawback being allowed on exportation) and are carried into the heart of the &s;ettled parts of Canada in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els that bring them from Europe, cannot be &s;old cheaper than the &s;ame articles, &s;ubject to a heavy duty, and carried an immen&s;e di&s;tance by land, and an expen&s;ive inland navigation? this indeed may not apply to the upper po&s;ts; but who are the con&s;umers of Ea&s;t India articles in tho&s;e cold, poor, and barren regions?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the more any one con&s;iders this article, the more fully he will be convinced, that it contains a complete and ab|&s;olute &s;urrender of the fur trade, the greater part of which we might have exclu&s;ively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the treaty of peace, had not Lord Grenville prevaried on Mr. Jay, to introduce a rival who will always be too powerful for us. And what ren|ders this circum&s;tance the more peculiarly oppre&s;&s;ive, is, that this article is to be permanent; Lord Grenville was too &s;en&s;ible of its importance, to permit any time or circum&s;tances to un|loo&s;e the&s;e galling fetters.</P>
<P>This article is not le&s;s exceptionable in a political, than in a commercial, view.

The <HI>manner afore&s;aid,</HI> alludes to the former part of the article, which gives the Briti&s;h a right to navigate our rivers from the &s;ea to the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreigners, and from thence by land into the Indian country. The only natural con&s;truction of the&s;e words, is, that the Briti&s;h &s;hall have a right to import into the United States upon the &s;ame terms as Americans; and yet I can hardly conceive that Mr. Jay could intend, in the face of a law of the United States (Act making further provi&s;ion for the payment of the debts of the United States, chap. 39. &s;ec. 2.) which impo&s;es an additional duty of ten per cent. on ar|ticles imported in ve&s;&s;els not of the United States; I &s;ay, I &s;hould hardly conceive that he &s;hould pre&s;ume to enter into &s;uch &s;tipulation directly in the face of a law of the United States, and that, too, in favor of a nation who&s;e navigation act is at war with our commerce; did it not breathe the &s;ame &s;pi|rit with the 12th, 14th, and 15th articles, all of which &s;trike directly at the navigation of the&s;e &s;tates. Nor do I know any other con&s;truction that can po&s;&s;ibly be put on the words, which I have &s;tated at large, that every reader may judge for him&s;elf. It is, however, po&s;&s;ible, that Mr. Jay may have <HI>intended</HI> (for never was a public in&s;trument drawn with le&s;s preci&s;ion than the one before us) that this provi&s;ion &s;hould only extend to goods brought in for the purpo&s;es of the Indian trade; yet how the words can be made to bear this co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ruction, I am at a lo&s;s to conceive. But &s;hould even this be admitted to be the true meaning, it will again prove the extreme &s;olicitude of the framers of the treaty, to &s;ecure to the Briti&s;h the whole benefit of the Indian trade; without this article, goods might be pur|cha&s;ed of our merchants, for the purpo&s;e of this commerce, which would, on account of the ten per cent. difference, have been imported in American ve&s;&s;els; but this &s;light advantage, it &s;eems, was deemed too much for the &s;acrifice of the whole profits of the Indian trade. It is therefore &s;tipulated, that the Briti&s;h &s;hall navigate our rivers to the highe&s;t port of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els, and that upon this con&s;truction they &s;hall pay <HI>no foreign duty</HI> for the articles they import; &s;o that all that the Briti&s;h merchants will have to do, will be to e&s;tabli&s;h factories at the ports of entry, and under pretence of the Indian trade (if it &s;hould be thought that the words &s;hould be confined to that) import in Briti&s;h bottoms, upon the &s;ame terms as we d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">

<P>HAVING had occa&s;ion to &s;how, in con&s;idering the treaty in a mere commercial view, that it contained an expre&s;s relinqui&s;hment of the Indian trade; that it placed the We&s;t Indian commerce upon &s;o di&s;advantageous a footing, as to ren|der foreign nations our carriers, not only in that trade, but in the exportation of many articles (as &s;ugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa) that we might import from the We&s;t Indies, or rai&s;e among our&s;elves; I proceed now to &s;how, that our ve&s;&s;els will become equally u&s;ele&s;s in the European trade, if the treaty goes into effect. By the &s;imple operation of her navigation laws, Britain had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her&s;elf of almo&s;t the whole of the carrying trade between the United States and her dominions. From October 1789 to September 1790, both inclu&s;ive, the amount of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exports to Britain and her dominions were of the value of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> millions three hundred and &s;ixty-three dollars; and our imports from thence, upwards of fifteen millions two hundred thou&s;and dollars; making, together, upwards of twenty-four millions five hundred thou&s;and dollars, on which commerce we paid Britain a balance of near &s;ix millions, while we gained from hence a balance of more than two millions and one half; yet this immen&s;e trade with Britain only employed 43, 580 tons of American ve&s;&s;els, while the trade to France employed 116, 410 tons, though our trade with her was le&s;s than one-fifth of our trade with Britain. The extreme injury the United States &s;u&s;|tained by thus &s;uffering a foreign nation to run away with their carrying trade, and, of cour&s;e, cutting the &s;inews of their commerce and maritime &s;trength, was urged as the be&s;t argu|ment for the formation of the federal government; as, by that means, we &s;hould acquire the means of making re&s;trictive laws upon the commerce of nations that oppre&s;&s;ed ours. We accord|ingly find, that very early after the formation of our govern|ment, tonnage duties were impo&s;ed upon foreign ve&s;&s;els; and the immediate effect of them was to add new vigor to our navi|gation; it will appear by the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our tonnage,
<PB N="163" REF="028389_0162_0FD8E8624E19C590">compared with that I have given, that, under the operation of this law, we were progre&s;&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t to a con&s;iderable degree of rank among maritime nations, as to incur the jealou&s;y of that ambitious and &s;elfi&s;h people, who fancy them&s;elves the lords of the ocean, and con&s;ider every other that attempts to navigate it, as intruders upon their rights. To this cau&s;e we mu&s;t attribute, in part, the various attacks that they have, from time to time, made on our commerce; it remained, however, to give it the fatal and final blow, which &s;hould put it out of our power to carry for our&s;elves or others: and the honor of effecting this was re&s;erved for our envoy extraordinary, and a majority of that body to whom the &s;tates had confided our deare&s;t rights. I have already ob&s;erved, that the 12th article, taken together with the in&s;tructions of the 8th of January (at this moment in force) effectually precludes us, not only from the carrying trade of Briti&s;h or French i&s;lands, even though France has generou&s;ly admitted us to carry from hers on the mo&s;t favorable terms, but has actually cut off the carriage of our own commodities and certain others, of foreign and dome&s;tic growth, from our own &s;tates; and that the trade of India-goods is &s;o managed al&s;o, as nece&s;&s;arily to fall to the &s;hare of Britain, to the exclu&s;ion of our&s;elves. Let us now &s;ee on what footing our European trade will &s;tand: 1&s;t. In time of peace, and next, when Britain &s;hall be at war. By our tonnage and reve|nue laws, our &s;hips had an advantage in the trade to Britain, of 44 cents the ton; and the di&s;criminating duty of near 10 per cent. operated as a premium upon our own &s;hipping; yet even this by no means countervailed the effect of the navigation law, and other re&s;traints upon our commerce. But &s;till under the operation of the&s;e &s;tatutes of the United States, our trade and navigation flouri&s;hed, and was increa&s;ing; and as we re&s;erved a right in our own hands, in ca&s;e of new burdens, to impo&s;e further duties upon tho&s;e that injured us, we had the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity again&s;t any further legal attacks upon our commerce. Becau&s;e, &s;uch was the nature of our commodities as to be e&s;&s;ential to the nations with whom we dealt; while a variety of markets could furni&s;h upon nearly equal terms, tho&s;e that we wanted. To Britain we paid an annual balance of near &s;ix millions of dollars: which &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, and perhaps for ever, have lo&s;t, if, by a commercial warfare, &s;he diverted it into any other channel. What, however, &s;he did not dare to attempt openly by her laws, &s;he has fully effected by her treaty.</P>
<P>By the 14th and 15th articles, we agree, that &s;he &s;hall im|po&s;e upon our American ve&s;&s;els, a tonnage duty, <HI>equal</HI> to what her &s;hips pay here; that the &s;hall al&s;o impo&s;e a duty which &s;hall

Does not France re&s;erve a right to do the &s;ame? Undoubtedly; had the article &s;topped at this point, it would have been perfectly ju&s;t; and the navigation of each nation would have then depended upon the means they re&s;pectively had of building, victualling, and &s;ailing their &s;hips, which is exactly the ca&s;e between us and France. But unfortunately the articles referred to, while they affect to be reciprocal, leave in full force the Briti&s;h navigation act, and all their other re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|tive laws, by this artful appendix to the 14th article, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: "But &s;ubject always, as to what re&s;pects this article, to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries re&s;pectively."

<P>Mr. Jay, therefore, agrees, in the 14th article, that all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> laws, as well as tho&s;e of Britain, &s;hall remain in force; but in the 15th article he evades the provi&s;ion &s;o far as re&s;pects <HI>us,</HI> and expre&s;sly &s;tipulates, that <HI>we</HI> &s;hall lay no additional charge upon Britain to contervail her navigation and other re&s;trictive laws; but that <HI>&s;he</HI> may, while &s;he pre&s;erves them in full force, impo&s;e a tonnage and other duties to contervail tho&s;e <HI>we</HI> had impo&s;ed, in order to enable us to bear up again&s;t them. I a&s;k them in what this article is reciprocal?

<P N="1">1&s;t. As it is obvious, that the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our navigation, is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the operation of the laws I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oned; it mu&s;t follow, that whatever countervails the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of tho&s;e laws, mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it back to the
<PB N="165" REF="028389_0164_0FD8E86C93814170">&s;tate in which it was. Now, as the profits of every voyage are calculated on the outward and homeward voyage, if we pay in the Briti&s;h dominions exactly what they pay here, the charge upon the whole voyage is the &s;ame. If then, previous to the pa&s;&s;ing our tonnage laws, the Briti&s;h, by the operation of their navigation laws, had &s;uch advantage over us, in our own com|merce, as to employ two hundred and thirty thou&s;and tons of their &s;hipping, as they did in 1789; while the whole of Ameri|can &s;hipping employed in the trade with Britain and its domi|nions, amounted, in the &s;ame year, to only 3, 580 tons, le&s;s than one-&s;ixth part of the whole quantity engaged in the inter|change of commodities between the two nations&mdash;it mu&s;t fol|low, that we &s;hall again be reduced, in <HI>con&s;equence of the treaty,</HI> to our former humiliating &s;ituation; our &s;eamen mu&s;t go into the &s;ervice of the nation that is again to navigate for us; and our &s;hip-builders, and the numerous trades connected with them, mu&s;t &s;tarve, or &s;eek &s;ome other employment, &s;ince our merchants will no longer have occa&s;ion for &s;hips, and the Bri|ti&s;h merchants are not permitted to <HI>u&s;e tho&s;e</HI> we build. It is ob|&s;ervable, too, that the tonnage duty, which Britain is to lay, is not a countervailing duty, like that on goods imported, but is to be, in the words of the article, "<HI>equal to that which is paya|ble by</HI> Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the ports of America." Now foreign ve&s;&s;els pay 50 cents here; of cour&s;e, 50 cents may be impo&s;ed on our ve&s;&s;els in Britain; but our own ve&s;&s;els al&s;o pay &s;ix cents a ton at home, &s;o that on every voyage to the Briti&s;h dominions, and home again, they will pay 56 cents, while the Briti&s;h pay only 50; and as the voyage may be performed three times a year, the American &s;hip will pay on the whole, 18 cents a ton annually more than the Briti&s;h; and it may be a que&s;tion, whe|ther we have any right to repeal the law laying the home duty, as it was impo&s;ed and enacted when the treaty was made and ratified, and as the repeal would put the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in a le&s;s advantageous &s;ituation than they were in at the time the treaty was made. But the di&s;cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ement does not re&s;t here, except &s;o far as our trade may be co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ined to the city of London; for in every other port we pay an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tra</HI> light money of 1<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9<ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;ter|ling a ton, which is about 39 cents; &s;o that an American ve&s;&s;el going to Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, &amp;c. and returning, will pay (be|&s;ides the 50 cents the Briti&s;h are to impo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 6 cents Ame|rican tonnage, and 39 cents extra light money, that is, 45 cents more a ton than a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ame voyage, and which in three voyages, or one year, will amount, on a ve&s;&s;el of 400 tons, to 540 dollars, extra charge on Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els.

I am a little &s;urprized that the words <HI>reciprocal</HI> had not &s;mote Mr. Jay's con&s;cience, when the very &s;entence in which he u&s;es it, holds forth partial advantages to Britain, and none to America. Why mu&s;t all the territories of the United States be laid open to Briti&s;h mer|chants; whil&s;t ours are confined only to the &s;pot preci&s;ely on which they find no intere&s;t in &s;ettling? Were we permitted to &s;ettle and carry on trade in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, on the footing of natives, many would find an intere&s;t in availing them&s;elves of it. But what American merchant will think of e&s;tabli&s;hing a mercantile hou&s;e in England, unle&s;s in partner&s;hip with a native of that country? in which ca&s;e the article is u&s;e|le&s;s to him. Is it not evident, that this is part of the &s;y&s;tem I hinted at in my la&s;t? It will be &s;till more &s;o, when we reflect, that &s;everal modes of retaliation were propo&s;ed by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, as the means of compelling Britain to treat us as we merited, in return for the great benefit we permitted her to derive from our commerce. Among others, he &s;ugge&s;ts, "that where a nation refu&s;es permi&s;&s;ion to our merchants and factors to re|&s;ide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it &s;hould be thought expedient, refu&s;e re&s;idence to theirs, in any or every part of ours, or modify their tran&s;actions."</P>
<P>The framers of the treaty apprehended, that in the cour&s;e either of commercial or political events, &s;uch prohibition, or &s;ome partial re&s;traint, might become nece&s;&s;ary: they, therefore, without any equivalent, bound the hands of this country; while the only re&s;traints which Britain would ever find it ex|pedient to impo&s;e, were left in full force.&mdash;It is remarkable, that all the means that have ever been propo&s;ed for counter|acting the re&s;trictive laws of Britain, either by individuals, by &s;tates, and by congre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f, have been carefully examined by our negoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tor; not to advance them by his treaty, but pre|ci&s;ely

It was determined by this treaty to put it in future out of our power; and we bind our&s;elves to let the Briti&s;h continue their re&s;trictions, but to impo&s;e none. Con|gre&s;s agree to a tonnage and duty which is to give the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">|tion of the United States &s;ome advantage over that of foreign|ers. Mr. Jay agrees (in con&s;ideration, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> treatment we have received from that nation) that though the&s;e regulations &s;hall affect others, they &s;hall be of no avail again&s;t Britain. It has been propo&s;ed to make the Briti&s;h debts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;werable for Briti&s;h depredations. Mr. Jay (fearful that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ter &s;hould not be left for another emba&s;&s;y extraordinary) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ure again to bind our hands; and all this without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of equivalent. Can any body &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e extraordinary &s;tipulations were accidental? Is any man &s;o blind, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ee in them the acts of a party determined to &s;trengthen them|&s;elves by a foreign alliance, and to wre&s;t from the hands of their antagoni&s;ts the weapons by which their ally might be an|noyed?

Why, with &s;o much greater cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion than Britain, &s;hould we be more fearle&s;s? She does not permit the citizens of the United States to re&s;ide for the purpo&s;es of trade in any of her dominions out of Europe. She certainly does this, either becau&s;e &s;he &s;uppo&s;es that they may be dangerous, or becau&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="028389_0170_0FD8E878A4DE04D0">&s;he wi&s;hes to &s;ecure the trade to her own &s;ubjects; and &s;hould either of the&s;e motives operate with le&s;s force on us?</P>
<P>This article concludes with the following words, "But &s;ub|ject always as to what re&s;pects this article, to the laws and &s;ta|tutes of the two countries re&s;pectively;" this mu&s;t mean &s;ub|ject to the laws which exi&s;ted at the time of the &s;ignature or ratification of the treaty; for otherwi&s;e, either party might, at will, defeat the provi&s;ions it contained, and render the whole a dead letter, which is too ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e.&mdash;In order to &s;ee, then, how far this provi&s;ion is reciprocal, we will examine what laws, relative to the commerce of the two countries, were in force at that or this time.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. We impo&s;e upon Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, in common with other foreigners, a tonnage duty of 50 cents, that is, 44 beyond what our citizens pay;&mdash;this, however, is more than counter|vailed by the clau&s;e in the 15th article, which permits them to lay an equal tonnage upon our &s;hips.</P>
<P N="2">2d. We impo&s;e extra duties which may average 10 per cent. on the cargoes of foreign &s;hips; this, however, is counter|vailed by the right the Briti&s;h re&s;erve, to impo&s;e an equivalent duty. It mu&s;t follow, then, that their commerce with us is ab&s;olutely free, and &s;tands upon the &s;ame ground, as that of our own citizens. If then our commerce with Britain is equally free, the article is reciprocal; if, on the other hand, our trade is &s;hackled by the laws which are left in force, then the article is not reciprocal.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Then, Britain prohibits our trade with &s;everal parts of her dominions, except in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. She impo&s;es near 40 cents extra light money, a ton, upon our ve&s;&s;els, except in the port of London; this, with the 50 cents tonnage we have given her a right to lay, and the 6 cents our own ve&s;&s;els pay at home, make a premium on her ve&s;&s;els, or a duty on ours, equal to 46 cents a ton, to the di&s;|advantage of our own navigation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. She compels us, in our trade with her, to navigate only with American &s;eamen, which is a peculiar di&s;advantage to a nation which, like ours, is always receiving u&s;eful hands from other countries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. She does not permit her citizens to make u&s;e of Ame|rican-built ve&s;&s;els; that is, &s;he di&s;courages our &s;hip-builders; while, by the treaty, we encourage hers.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>All the&s;e re&s;trictions, and &s;ome &s;lighter ones that might be mentioned, are impo&s;ed on us by laws, which, by the 14th article, we have pre&s;erved in full force; at the &s;ame time, that we have agreed, that the only two checks we had placed on her commerce and navigation, &s;hall be done away; for a counter|vailing duty, or a repeal of the duty, amounts exactly to the &s;ame thing; except &s;o far as the repeal would affect the reve|nue, that no new ones &s;hall be impo&s;ed. Would not any body have imagined, that this long li&s;t of burdens would have made Lord Grenville blu&s;h to a&s;k, or Mr. Jay to grant, countervailing duties, when all we had done, was already countervailed, at lea&s;t ten fold. Where is the reciprocity of this article? What could be our envoy's inducement to enter into it? Were we afraid, that our merchants would not be &s;uffered to &s;ettle in Britain without it? Was it an object of any moment if they did not? was he fearful that they would lay new burdens upon us? was not the catalogue of oppre&s;&s;ion as full as it could be? had not Britain her&s;elf already acq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;ced near &s;ix years in the ju&s;tice of our impo&s;ing a duty upon her &s;hipping and merchan|dizes? has &s;he &s;tipulated for qualizing duties with other nations, on whom &s;he has impo&s;ed &s;imilar burdens, and who in return have taxed her trade? is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a nation in the world, from whom &s;he derives &s;o many advantages as from us, or who burdens her trade &s;o little? and have we no right to any return for all this? could the Briti&s;h court have objected, if we were to treat on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing of reciprocal advantage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, if M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Jay had &s;tated each of the&s;e re&s;trictions, and demanded an equivalent for it, if it would break in too much on their &s;y&s;tem to remove them?

But to &s;ubmit to all, to a&s;k no equivalent, to relinqui&s;h the right of doing our&s;elves ju&s;tice, was a mo&s;t unheard-of de&s;ertion of the intere&s;ts of our own country. It was one which no other nation in the world would &s;uffer to pa&s;s with impunity, and which I grieve to think a &s;ingle native of America can be found to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>It is true, that this article propo&s;es, that two years after the pre&s;ent war, the contracting parties may treat for the equaliza|tion of the duties, &amp;c. but that in the mean time it is to remain on the footing the treaty places it. Upon what ground was this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion po&s;tponed? if Mr. Jay was &s;ent to make a treaty, why did he not make it, but leave it open to future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? is it probable that at the end of the war (which may la&s;t &s;everal years, and two years after, that is, when Britain has had time to recruit her &s;trength and her finances, &s;he will be more moderate in her views, than at this moment, when &s;he is overwhelmed with calamities? Is it probable, that at that period our trade will be of more con&s;equence to her than now, that &s;he has lo&s;t two important branches of it, Holland and France? It &s;hould be recollected, that the exportations from the Briti&s;h dominions to the United States, taken on the medium of two years, 1784 and 1785, exceed one-third of all her manufactures exported <HI>to all the re&s;t of the world.</HI></P>
<P>At that time, Holland, which, next to America, is their be&s;t cu&s;tomer, had not declined their market. At pre&s;ent it will not be extravagant to allege, that the United States con|&s;ume two-fifths of all the Briti&s;h manufactures that are exported to foreign nations. The di&s;tre&s;s that a rupture with us, or any interruption of our commerce, would occa&s;ion in England, is beyond calculation. This, then, was the moment to treat upon the mo&s;t advantageous terms, or to exert our inherent right to do our&s;elves ju&s;tice <HI>by our own laws.</HI> It is in knowing how to take advantage of &s;uch circum&s;tances, that true policy con&s;i&s;ts. Every one remembers how much the pre&s;ident's fore&s;ight was commended in having &s;eized upon this moment to &s;end a &s;pe|cial envoy. But this envoy, it &s;eems, thought differently from the pre&s;ident, and agrees formally, that we &s;hall take no advan|tage of the ground on which we &s;tand; but that, when Bri|tain may have recovered what &s;he has lo&s;t, then we will treat.</P>
<P>Is there any kind of connection between the pre&s;ent war and our commercial regulations with Britain? If not, why have any reference to the war, in &s;etting the time for making our arrangements? Why but to give Britain &s;till greater advan|tages

<P>IT was my intention to have compri&s;ed in two numbers, the examination of the 2d article; but on experiment, it was found expedient to add a third. I re&s;ume, for a moment, the &s;ubject of indemnification for the detention of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>As an inducement to per&s;i&s;t in this claim, we are a&s;&s;ured, that the magnanimity of France, would have procured for us, its e&s;tabli&s;hment. In the fir&s;t place, this &s;uppo&s;es that we we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to have become a party in the war; for otherwi&s;e it would be &s;illy to imagine, that France would, on our account, embarra&s;s her&s;elf with a difficulty of this &s;ort. In this ca&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;ing the object accompli&s;hed, &s;till the injuries, lo&s;&s;es, and expen&s;es of war would have greatly overbalanced the advantage gained. But what certainty have we, that France will be able to dictate terms, even for her&s;elf? Could we expect or rely, after the ter|rible and wa&s;ting war, in which &s;he has been engaged, that &s;he would be willing to encumber the making of peace, with addi|tional ob&s;tacles, to &s;ecure &s;o trifling a point with us? Would it be even humane, or friendly in us, to a&s;k her to ri&s;k the pro|longing
<PB N="175" REF="028389_0174_0FD8E885985E57A0">of her calamities, for &s;o trivial an object? A conduct like this, with reference either to France, or to our&s;elves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uld re&s;emble that of the game&s;ter, who &s;hould play <HI>millions</HI> again&s;t <HI>farthings.</HI> It is &s;o prepo&s;terous in every &s;en&s;e, that the recommendation of it, if &s;incere, admits of but one con&s;truc|tion, namely, that tho&s;e who recommend it, wi&s;h our envoy to have acted not as if he had been &s;ent <HI>to make peace,</HI> but as if he had been &s;ent <HI>to make war,</HI> to blow and &s;pread the de&s;olating f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ames of di&s;cord and contention.</P>
<P>There is a marked di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, running through the ob&s;ervations, which are made to the prejudice of the treaty: they endeavour con&s;tantly to have it under&s;tood, that our envoy abandoned, without effort, the claims which have not been e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;Whence is this inferred? Is it from the &s;ilence of the treaty? Surely we can only expect to find there what was <HI>agreed upon,</HI> not what was <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>rejected.</HI> The truth is, that as well on this point of indemnification, for the detention of the po&s;ts, as on that of compen&s;ation, for the negroes carried away, our envoy urged our preten&s;ions, as far, and as long, as he could do it, without making them final ob&s;tacles to the pro|gre&s;s of the negociation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now enumerate and an&s;wer the remaining objections, which have appeared again&s;t this article. They are the&s;e: 1. That the po&s;ts to be &s;urrendered, in&s;tead of being de&s;cribed in general terms, &s;hould, for greater certainty, have been &s;pecially enumerated; that now the uncertainty of a part of the boun|dary line, may furni&s;h a pretext for detaining &s;ome of them. 2. That the expre&s;&s;ions "precincts and juri&s;dictions," which are excepted from our right of &s;ettlement, previous to the &s;urrender, are &s;o vague and indeterminate, as to be capable of being made to countenance encroachments. 3. That it was improper to have &s;tipulated, for the inhabitants, the option of re&s;iding and con|tinuing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or of becoming American citizens: that the fir&s;t was to e&s;tabli&s;h, by treaty, a Briti&s;h colony, within our limits; the la&s;t to admit, without the power of exception, bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter enemies of the country, to the privileges of citizens. 4. That the &s;ecuring to tho&s;e inhabitants, the enjoyment of their property is exceptionable, as being a "ce&s;&s;ion without equiva|lent of an <HI>indefinite extent of territory.</HI>" This is the character given to it by the meeting at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objection, is, that the enumeration propo&s;ed might have included the very danger which is objected to the provi&s;ion as it &s;tands, and which is completely avoided by it. The principal po&s;ts occupied by the Briti&s;h, are known and might ea&s;ily have been enum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ated; but there is a po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="176" REF="028389_0175_0FD8E886D65210C8">there being others not known, which might have e&s;caped. La&s;t year there &s;tarted up a po&s;t, which had not been before hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of, on the pretence of an old trading e&s;tabli&s;hment. Who knows with ab&s;olute certainty, how many &s;imilar ca&s;es may e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in the va&s;t extent of wilderne&s;s, as far as the lake of the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, has been inacce&s;&s;ible to us? If our envoy's information could have been perfect, at the time of his la&s;t advices from America; between that period and the &s;igning of the treaty, changes might have taken place, that is, trading hou&s;es might have grown into military po&s;ts, as they did in the ca&s;e referred to; a ca&s;e, which, in fact, happened after the departure of our envoy from the United States. Was it not far better than to hazard an imperfect &s;pecification, to u&s;e terms &s;o general and comprehen&s;ive, as could not fail, in any circum&s;tances, to embrace every ca&s;e? Certainly it was; and the terms <HI>"all ports and places,"</HI> which are tho&s;e u&s;ed in the treaty, are thus comprehen&s;ive. Nothing can e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Neither is there the lea&s;t danger that the uncertainty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This uncertainty, it is to be ob&s;erved, re&s;ults not from the late treaty, but from the treaty of peace. It is occa&s;ioned by its being un|known, whether any part of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi extends far enough north, to be inter&s;ected by a due we&s;t line from the lake of the Woods.</NOTE> of a part of the boundary line, can be made a pretext for detai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the po&s;ts, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate.

St. Croix, which is on a &s;ide unconnected with the po&s;ition of the po&s;ts) is that which is run from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.&mdash;The mo&s;t we&s;tern of our known po&s;ts, is at Mi|chillimackinac, at or near the junction of the lakes Huron and Michegan, ea&s;tward near eleven degrees of longitude of the lake of the Woods, and about ten degrees of longitude of that point, on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, below the falls of St. Anthony, where a &s;urvey, in order to a &s;ettlement of the line, is to begin. More|over, our line, by the treaty of peace, is to pa&s;s through the lake Huron, and the water communication between that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and lake Superior, and through the middle of lake Superior, and thence we&s;tward through other waters, to the lake of the Woods; that is, about half a degree of latitude more northward, and about eight degrees of longitude more we&s;tward, than any part of the lake Michegan. Whence it is manife&s;t, that any clo&s;ing line, to be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, mu&s;t pa&s;s at a di&s;tance of &s;everal hundred miles from Michillimackinac. If the Briti&s;h, therefore, &s;hould be

Nor can we de&s;ire a better proof of the igno|rance or di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of the objectors to the treaty, than their having contrived one of this nature.</P>
<P>The general terms u&s;ed, were to be preferred, for the very rea&s;on, that there was a doubt about the cour&s;e of a part of the boundary line; for, if there &s;hould chance to exi&s;t any po&s;t now unknown, &s;o near the line as to render it que&s;tionable, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, on which &s;ide it may fall; the moment the line is &s;ettled, the obligation to &s;urrender will be &s;ettled with it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd objection lo&s;es all force, when it is con&s;idered, that the exception can only operate till the fir&s;t of June next, the period for the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts; and that, in the mean time, there is ample &s;pace for &s;ettlement, without coming to di&s;putable ground. There was, be&s;ides, real difficulty in an accurate definition. What the precincts and juri&s;dictions of the po&s;ts are, is a que&s;tion of fact. In &s;ome in&s;tances, where, from there being no &s;ettlements, over which an actual juri&s;diction had been exerci&s;ed, a good rule might have been, the di&s;tance of gun &s;hot from the fortifications, which might have been &s;et|tled at a certain extent in miles, &s;ay three or four. But in &s;ome ca&s;es an actual juri&s;diction has been exerci&s;ed, under circum|&s;tances which created ob&s;tacles to a preci&s;e definition. The ca&s;e of Caldwell's manor, in the vicinity of Dutchman's point, is an example. There, a mixed juri&s;diction has been &s;ometimes ex|erci&s;ed by the Briti&s;h, and by the &s;tate of Vermont, connected with a di&s;puted title to that manor; one party claiming under an ancient French grant, and the other under the &s;tate of Ver|mont. Detroit and its vicinity would al&s;o have occa&s;ioned em|barra&s;&s;ment. From the &s;ituation of the &s;ettlements, and of a number of di&s;per&s;ed trading e&s;tabli&s;hments, a latitude was likely to have been required, to which it might have been expedient to give a &s;anction. In &s;uch &s;ituations, where a thing is to la&s;t but a &s;hort time, it is commonly the mo&s;t eligible cour&s;e, to avoid definition. It is obvious, that no ill can re&s;ult from the want of one, if the po&s;ts are &s;urrendered at the time agreed; if not, it is equally plain, that it can be of no con&s;equence, becau&s;e the whole article will be void.</P>
<P>The third objection becomes in&s;ignificant, the moment the real &s;tate of things is adverted to. This has been de&s;cribed in a former number for another purpo&s;e, but will now be recapitu|lated, with one or two additional facts. The fir&s;t po&s;ts, begin|ning ea&s;tward, are, Point-au-fer and Dutchman's point, on like Champlain. The whole number of per&s;ons in this vicinity,
<PB N="178" REF="028389_0177_0FD8E88D6BF7D048">over whom juri&s;diction has been claimed by the Briti&s;h, may amount to an hundred families. But the claim of juri&s;diction here, has been only occa&s;ionally and feebly urged; and it is a&s;&s;orted in addition, by well informed per&s;ons, that the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|mentioned families have been, for &s;ome time, regularly repre|&s;ented in the legi&s;lature of Vermont, the ordinary civil juri&s;dic|tion of which &s;tate has, with little interruption, been extended over them. At neither of the other po&s;ts, to wit, O&s;weg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Niagara, the Miami, Detroit, Michillimackinac, is there any &s;ettlement, except at Detroit, where, and in the vicinity of which, there may be between two and three thou&s;and per&s;ons, chiefly French Canadians, and their de&s;cendants. It will be un|der&s;tood, that I do not con&s;ider as a &s;ettlement, two or three log hou&s;es for traders.</P>
<P>It follows, that the number of per&s;ons who can be embraced by the privileges &s;tipulated, is too incon&s;iderable to admit of attaching any political con&s;equences whatever to the &s;tipulation&punc; Of what importance can it po&s;&s;ibly be, to the United States, whether two or three thou&s;and per&s;ons, men, women and children, are permitted to re&s;ide within their limits, either as Briti&s;h or American &s;ubjects, at their option? If the thing was an object of de&s;ire to Great Britain, for the accommodation of the individuals con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erned, could it have merited a moment's he&s;itation on our part? As to re&s;idence, it is at the courte&s;y of nations at peace to permit the re&s;idence of the citizens of each other within their re&s;pective territories. Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are now free by our laws, to re&s;ide in all parts of the United States. As to the permi&s;&s;ion to become citizens, it has been the general policy and practice of our country to facilitate the naturaliza|tion of foreigners. And we may &s;afely count on the intere&s;t of individuals, and on that de&s;ire to enjoy equal rights which is &s;o deeply planted in the human brea&s;t, that all who re&s;olve to make their permanent re&s;idence with us, will become citizens.</P>
<P>It is true, that there may be a few obnoxious characters (though I do not recollect to have heard of more than two or three) among the number of tho&s;e who have acquired by the &s;tipulation, a right to become citizens of the United States. But would it ever have been worthy of the dignity of the na|tional wrath, to have launched its thunders again&s;t the heads of two, or three, or half a dozen de&s;picable individuals? Can we &s;uppo&s;e that, without a &s;tipulation, it would have been thought worth the while to make a &s;pecial exception of their ca&s;es out of the operation of our general laws of naturalization? And if this had not been done, would they not have found means, if they de&s;ired it, after the lap&s;e of a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt period, to
<PB N="179" REF="028389_0178_0FD8E88F15F5E320">acquire the rights of citizens? It is to be ob&s;erved, that citi|zens of our own, who may have committed crimes again&s;t our laws, not remitted by the treaty of peace, would find no pro|tection under this article.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the &s;tipulation had not been made, what would have been the probable policy of the United States? Would it not have been to leave the handful of &s;ettlers undi&s;turbed, in quiet enjoyment of their property, and at liberty, if Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, to continue &s;uch, or become American citizens, on the u&s;ual conditions? A &s;y&s;tem of depopulation, or of coercion to one allegiance or another, would have been little congenial with our modes of thinking, and would not, I am per&s;uaded, have been attempted.</P>
<P>If, then, the treaty only &s;tipulates in this re&s;pect, what would have been the cour&s;e of things without it, what cau&s;e for &s;erious objection can there be on this account?</P>
<P>The matter of the fourth objection can only derive a mo|ment's importance from mi&s;apprehen&s;ion. It &s;eems to have been imagined, that there are large tracts of land, held under Briti&s;h grants, made &s;ince the peace, which are confirmed by the part of the article that gives the inhabitants the right of removing with, &s;elling, or <HI>retaining</HI> their property.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is to be ob&s;erved, that if &s;uch grants had been made, the &s;tipulation could not be deemed to confirm them; becau&s;e our laws mu&s;t determine the que&s;tion, what is the property of the inhabitants; and they would rightfully de|cide, that the Briti&s;h government, &s;ince the treaty of peace, could make no valid grants of land, within our limits. Upon the ground even of its own preten&s;ions, it could not have made &s;uch grants. Nothing more was claimed, than the right to de|tain the po&s;ts as a ho&s;tage. The right to grant lands pre-&s;up|po&s;es much more, a full right of &s;overeignty and territory.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place, it has always been under&s;tood, and upon recent and careful enquiry is confirmed, <HI>that the Briti&s;h government has never, &s;ince the peace, made a grant of lands within our limits.</HI> It appears, indeed, to have been its policy, to prevent &s;ettlements in the vicinity of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;tipulation, as it affects lands, does nothing more than confirm the property of tho&s;e which were holden at the treaty of peace; neither is the quantity con&s;iderable; and it chiefly, if not altogether, depends on titles acquired under the French government, while Canada was a province of France.</P>
<P>In giving this confirmation, the treaty only pur&s;ues what is a con&s;tant rule among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivilized nations. When territory is ceded or yielded up by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e nation to another, it is a common practice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="180" REF="028389_0179_0FD8E890C99811E8">if not a &s;pecial condition, to leave the inhabitants in the enjoy|ment of their property. A contrary conduct would be di&s;grace|ful to a nation; nor is it very reputable to the objectors to the treaty, that they have levelled their battery again&s;t this part of it. It is a reflection upon them too, that they employ for the purpo&s;e, terms which import more than is true, even on their own &s;uppo&s;ition, and are, therefore, calculated to deceive; for the confirmation of property to individuals, could be at mo&s;t a ce&s;&s;ion only of the right of &s;oil, and not of territory, which term has a technical &s;en&s;e, including juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Let it be added, that the treaty of peace, in the article which provides "that there &s;hould be no future confi&s;cations nor pro|&s;ecutions again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons, by rea&s;on of the part which he or they might have taken in the war; and that no per&s;on &s;hould, on that account, &s;uffer any future lo&s;s or damage, either in his per&s;on, liberty or property," did &s;ub&s;tantially what is made an objection to the treaty, under con&s;ideration. It will not, I believe, be di&s;puted, that it gave protection to all pro|perty antecedently owned, and not confi&s;cated. Indeed it is a que&s;tion, whether the &s;tipulations cited, would not have effect|ed, with regard to other rights than tho&s;e of property, a great part of what is regulated by the la&s;t treaty. Its provi&s;ions, in this particular, were, perhaps, in the main, unnece&s;&s;ary, fur|ther than to obviate a doubt which might have ari&s;en from the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the treaty, by the withholding of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus have I gone through every objection to the &s;econd arti|cle, which is in any degree colourable; and I flatter my&s;elf have &s;hown not only that the acqui&s;ition made by it, is of great and real value, but that it &s;tands as well as circum&s;tances per|mitted, and is defen&s;ible in its details. I have been the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> particular in the examination, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ailants of the treaty have exerted all their ingenuity to di&s;credit this article, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, no doubt, that it is a very valuable it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the treaty; and that it was important to their cau&s;e, to en|velope it in as thick a cloud of objection as they were able to contrive. As an expedient of party, there is &s;ome merit in the artifice; but a &s;en&s;ible people will &s;ee that it is merely artifice. It is a fal&s;e calculation, that the people of this country can ever be ultimately deceived.</P>

<P>THE object of the third article is connected with that of the &s;econd. The &s;urrender of the po&s;ts naturally drew with it an arrangement, with regard to inland trade and navi|gation. Such an arrangement, convenient in &s;everal re&s;pects, appears to be in &s;ome re&s;pects nece&s;&s;ary. To re&s;train the Indi|ans on either &s;ide of the line, from trading with the one party or the other, at di&s;cretion, be&s;ides the que&s;tionablene&s;s of the right, could not be attempted without rendering them di&s;gu&s;ted and ho&s;tile. The truth of this &s;eems to have influenced the conduct of Great Britain and France, while the latter was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada. The 15th article of the treaty of peace of Utretcht, in the year 1713, allows free liberty to the Indi|ans on each &s;ide, to re&s;ort for trade to the Briti&s;h and French colonies. It is to be ob&s;erved, too, that the Indians not only as&s;i&s;t on a right of going to trade with whom they plea&s;e, but of permitting whom they plea&s;e to come to trade with them, and al&s;o to re&s;ide among them for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Thus, the &s;outhern and &s;outh-we&s;tern Indians within our limits, maintain a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with Spain, e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ba&s;is of treaty&mdash;nor has their right to do it, been hitherto conte&s;ted by the United States.&mdash;Indeed, on what clear principle of ju&s;tice could this natural right of trade, of a people not &s;ubject to our ordinary juri&s;diction, be di&s;puted? This claim, on their part, gives a corre&s;ponding claim to neighbouring nations, to trade with them. Spain would think the preten&s;ion to exclude her inadmi&s;&s;ible&mdash;And Great Britain would have thought the &s;ame, if &s;he had found it her intere&s;t to a&s;&s;ert the right of in|tercour&s;e; views which would always be &s;econded by the In|dians from regard to their own intere&s;t and independence. It was a point, therefore, which it much concerned the pre&s;erva|tion of good under&s;tanding between the parties and with the Indians, to regulate on &s;ome equitable plan; and the more li|beral the plan, the more agreeable to a natural cour&s;e of things, and to the free participation of mutual advantages, the more likely was it to promote and prolong that important benefit.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the expediency of &s;ome arrangement was indicated by the circum&s;tance of the boundary line between the parties, running for an extent of &s;ixteen hundred miles through the middle of the &s;ame rivers, lakes, and waters. It may be deemed impo&s;&s;ible from the varying cour&s;e of winds and currents, for the &s;hips of one party to keep them&s;elves con&s;tantly within their own limits. without pa&s;&s;ing or tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="182" REF="028389_0181_0FD8E8974B8DD320">tho&s;e of the other. How, indeed, was the preci&s;e middle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e of tho&s;e great lakes to be always known?</P>
<P>It appears evident, that to render the navigation of the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> waters u&s;eful to, and &s;afe for, both parties, it was requi&s;ite that they &s;hould become common. Without this, frequent for|feitures to enforce interdictions of intercour&s;e might be incur|red&mdash;and there would be con&s;tant danger of interference and controver&s;y. It is probable, too, that when tho&s;e waters are better explored in their whole extent, it will be found that the be&s;t navigation of tho&s;e lakes is &s;ometimes on the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes on the other, and that common convenience will, in this re&s;pect, al&s;o be promoted by community of right.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;It is almo&s;t always mutually beneficial for bordering territories to have free and friendly intercour&s;e with each other&mdash;This relates not only to the advantages of an inter|change of commodities, for the &s;upply of mutual wants, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to tho&s;e of the reciprocal creation of indu&s;try, connected with that interchange, but al&s;o to tho&s;e of avoiding jealou&s;y, colli|&s;ion, and conte&s;t, of pre&s;erving friend&s;hip and harmon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash; Proximity of territory invites to trade&mdash;the bordering inhabi|tants, in &s;pite of every prohibition, will endeavour to carry it on;&mdash;if not allowed, illicit adventures take place of the regular operations of legali&s;ed commerce&mdash;individual intere&s;t leads to collu&s;ions to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de re&s;training regulations&mdash;habits of infracting the laws are produced&mdash;morals are perverted&mdash;&s;ecu|rities, nece&s;&s;arily great, in proportion as they counteract the natural cour&s;e of things, lay the foundation of di&s;contents and quarrels. Perhaps it may be &s;afely affirmed, that freedom of intercour&s;e, or violent hatred and enmity, are the alternative in every ca&s;e of contiguity of territory.</P>
<P>The maxims of the United States have hitherto favored a free intercour&s;e with all the world. They have conceived, that they had nothing to fear from the unre&s;trained competition of commercial enterprize, and have only de&s;ired to be admitted to it on equal terms. Hence, not only the communication by &s;ea has been open, with the adjacent territories, on our conti|nent, as well as with more di&s;tant quarte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the globe; but two ports have been erected on lake Champlain for the con|venience of interior commerce with Canada: and there is no ri&s;triction upon any nation, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">pi to the only port which has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the uni|on. The&s;e arrangements have created neither blame nor cri|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>Our envoy, therefore, in agreeing to a liberal plan of in|tercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h territories in our neighbourhood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="183" REF="028389_0182_0FD8E89A81D81390">conformed to the general &s;pirit of our country, and to the ge|neral policy of our laws. Great Britain, in acceding to &s;uch a plan, departed from her &s;y&s;tem of colonial monopoly, a de|parture which ought to be one recommendation of the plan to us; for every relaxation of that &s;y&s;tem paves the way for other and further relaxations. It might have been expected, al&s;o, that a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y might have proved an ob&s;tacle on the part of Great Britain; &s;ince, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the compo&s;ition of tho&s;e who inhabit, and are likely to inhabit Canada, it is morally certain, that there mu&s;t be, as the re&s;ult of a free intercour&s;e, a far greater momentum of influence of the United States upon Canada, than of Canada upon the United States. It would not have been &s;urpri&s;ing, if this jea|lou&s;y had &s;ought to keep us at a di&s;tance, and had counteracted the wi&s;er policy of limiting our de&s;ires by giving us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is alone to us truly de&s;irable, the advantages of com|merce, rather than of &s;uffering our wi&s;hes to be &s;timulated and extended by privation and re&s;traint.</P>
<P>New ideas &s;eem of late to have made their way among us. The extremes of commercial jealou&s;y are inculcated.&mdash;Regula|tion, re&s;triction, exclu&s;ion, are now with many the favorite topics&mdash;in&s;tead of feeling plea&s;ure, that new avenues of trade are opened, a thou&s;and dangers and mi&s;chiefs are pourtrayed when the occa&s;ion occurs. Free trade with all the world &s;eems to have dwindled into trade with France and her dominions. The love-&s;ick partizans of that country appear to regard her as the epitome of the univer&s;e, to have adopted for their mot|to, "All for love, and the world well lo&s;t."</P>
<P>The&s;e new propen&s;ities toward, commercial jealou&s;y, have been remarkably exemplified with re&s;pect to the article immedi|ately under con&s;ideration. Truly e&s;timated, it is a valuable in|gredient in the treaty; and yet there is, perhaps, no part of it which has been more &s;everely reprobated.&mdash;It will be ea&s;y to &s;how that it has been extremely mi&s;repre&s;ented, and that what have been deemed very exceptionable features, do not exi&s;t at all.</P>
<P>We will fir&s;t examine what the article really does contain, and afterwards what are the comparative advantages likely to re&s;ult to the two countries.</P>
<P>The main &s;tipulation is, that "it &s;hall at all times be free to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the citizens of the United States,&mdash;and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the boundary line, freely to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, <HI>by land and inland na|vigation,</HI> into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and countries of the two parties on the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ent of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the

<P>The &s;ubject matter of this &s;tipulation is plainly <HI>inland trade and commerce,</HI> to be carried on <HI>by land pa&s;&s;age, and inland naviga|tion.</HI> This appears, 1&s;t, from the terms of the article. The &s;ubjects and citizens of the two parties, and al&s;o the Indians dwelling on each &s;ide the boundary line, are freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s. In what manner? by <HI>land</HI> and <HI>inland navigation:</HI> to what places? into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay company only excepted). They are al&s;o to navi|gate all the lakes, rivers, and <HI>waters thereof,</HI> and freely to car|ry on trade and commerce with each other. This right to na|vigate lakes, rivers, and waters, mu&s;t be under&s;tood with re|ference to inland navigation; becau&s;e this gives it a &s;en&s;e con|formable with the antecedent clau&s;e, with which it is immedi|ately connected, as part of a &s;entence; becau&s;e the right to <HI>pa&s;s</HI> and <HI>repa&s;s,</HI> being expre&s;sly re&s;tricted to land and inland navigation, it would not be natural to extend it by implication, on the &s;trength of an ambiguous term, to pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, or by any thing more than inland navigation; becau&s;e the lakes and rivers have direct reference to inland navigation, &s;howing that to be the object in view; and the word "waters," from the order in which it &s;tands, will mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tently with pro|priety of compo&s;ition, be under&s;tood as &s;omething le&s;s than lakes and rivers, as ponds, canals, and tho&s;e amphibious wa|ters, to which it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to give a name; and be|cau&s;e the waters mentioned are "waters thereof," that is, wa|ters of the territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America; a de&s;cription which cannot very aptly be applied to the &s;ea, or be &s;uppo&s;ed to include navigation by &s;ea to the United States, or from them to the Briti&s;h territo|ries. It is true, that nations, for various purpo&s;es, claim and exerci&s;e juri&s;diction over the &s;eas, immediately adjacent to their coa&s;ts; yet this is &s;ubject to the common right of na|tions, to the innocent u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;eas for navigation; and it is not, <HI>prima facie,</HI> pre&s;umable, that two nations, &s;peaking of the waters of each other, would mean to give this appropriate de|nomination to waters, in which both claimed &s;ome common right.&mdash;The u&s;ual de&s;cription of &s;uch waters in treaties is, "the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> near</HI> the countries," &amp;c.&mdash;But were it otherwi&s;e, &s;till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">gating from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> into tho&s;e waters, could not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

The above con&s;truction is confirmed by the general com|plexion of the treaty. It is the manife&s;t province of the eigh|teen articles, which &s;ucceed the fir&s;t ten, to regulate external commerce and navigation. The regulations they contain, are introduced thus, by the 11th article: "It is agreed between his maje&s;ty and the United States of America, that there &s;hall be a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and commerce, between their re&s;pective people, in the manner, un|der the limitations, and on the conditions &s;pecified in the fol|lowing articles."&mdash;Then follow articles, which provide fully and di&s;tinctly for trade and navigation between the United States and the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies, between the A&s;iatic domi|nions of Great Britain and the United States; and la&s;tly, be|tween the European dominions of Great Britain and the Unit|ed States. The&s;e eighteen articles properly con&s;titute the treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries. Their general &s;cope, and &s;ome &s;pecial provi&s;ions which they contain, prove that the object of the third article is local and partial; that it contemplates exclu&s;ively, an interior commerce, by land and inland navigation (except as to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi) and parti|cularly that it does not reach at all our Atlantic ports. An in|&s;tance of one of the &s;pecial provi&s;ions alluded to, will be cited in the further examination of this article.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to this con&s;truction, much &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the provi&s;ions which immediately &s;ucceed the clau&s;es that have been quoted. They are in the&s;e words: "But it is under&s;tood, that this article does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the &s;eaports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories, nor into &s;uch parts of the ri|vers in his &s;aid territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading bona &s;ide between Montreal and Quebec: nor to the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea, into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea!" The la&s;t, it is &s;aid, contains an implica|tion, that under this article, Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els have a right to come to our highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea, while we are excluded from the &s;eaports of the Briti&s;h territories on this continent.</P>
<P>But this is altogether an erroneous inference. The clau&s;es la&s;t cited are in&s;erted for greater caution, to guard expre&s;&s;ively again&s;t any con&s;truction of the article, by implications more or le&s;s remote; contrary to the actual regulations of the parties, with regard to external commerce and navigation. Great Britain does not n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> permit a trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by &s;ea to Nova Scotia and Canada.
<PB N="186" REF="028389_0185_0FD8BE9217AEA710">She therefore declares that the article &s;hall not be deemed to contravene this regulation. The United States now permit &s;o|reign ve&s;&s;els to come to certain ports of entry from the &s;ea, but exclude them from other more interior ports of entry, to which our own ve&s;&s;els may come.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An example of this is &s;ound in the &s;tate of New York.

This was the more proper, as the right of inland navigation might have given &s;ome colour to the claim of going from an outer to an inner port of entry. But this negative of an implication <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which might have found &s;ome colour in the principal prova&s;ion, can never be con&s;trued into an affumative grant of a very important privilege, foreign to that principal provi&s;ion. The main object of the article, it has been &s;een, is trade by land, and inland navigation. Trade and navigation by &s;ea, with our &s;ea ports, is an entirely diflerent thing. To in&s;er a po&s;itive grant of this privilege, from a clau&s;e which &s;ays, that the right of inland navigation &s;hall not be con&s;trued to permit ve&s;&s;els coming from the &s;ea, to go from the ports of entry, to which our laws now re&s;trict them, to more interior ports, would be contrary to rea&s;on, and to every rule of &s;ound con&s;truction. Such a privilege could never be permitted to be founded upon any thing le&s;s than a po&s;itive and explicit grant. It could never be &s;upported by an implication drawn from an article relative to a local and partial object, much le&s;s by an implication drawn from the negative of another implication. The preten&s;ion, that all our ports were laid open to Great Britain by a covert and &s;ide-wind provi&s;ion, and this without reciprecity, without a right of acce&s;s to a &s;ingle &s;ea port of the other party in any part of the world, would be too mon&s;trous to be tolerated for an in&s;tant. The principles of equity between nations, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of interpretation, would unite to condemn &s;o great an inequality, if any other &s;en&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly be found for the terms from which it might be protended to be deduced. It would be in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the more inadmi&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the object is embraced and regulated by other parts of the treaty on terms of reciprocity.</P>
<P>The different mode of expre&s;&s;ion, in the clau&s;e la&s;t cited, when &s;peaking of the Briti&s;h territories, and when &s;peaking of the United States, has furni&s;hed an argument for the inference which has been &s;tated. But this difference is accounted for by
<PB N="187" REF="028389_0186_0FD8E8A5B390E1C8">the difference in the actual regulations of the parties, as de|&s;cribed above. The object was on each &s;ide to <HI>cu&s;t</HI> an implica|tion interfering with tho&s;e regulations. The expre&s;&s;ions to ef|fect it were commen&s;urate with the litte of the fact on each &s;ize; and con&s;equently do not warrant any collateral or &s;pecial infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce.</P>
<P>The only po&s;itive effect of the&s;e clau&s;es is to e&s;tabli&s;h, that the navigation from Montreal to Quebec, &s;hall be carried on in what are called "&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, trading bone &s;ide between Montreal and Quebec." In determining their &s;en&s;e, it merits &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ervation, that they do not profe&s;s to <HI>except from</HI> the operation of the general provi&s;ions of the article, the <HI>&s;ea ports,</HI> &amp;c. of the Briti&s;h territories; but declare, that it is under&s;tood that tho&s;e provi&s;ions <HI>do not extend to</HI> them. This is more a de|claration that the antecedent provi&s;ions were not &s;o broad as to comprehend the ca&s;es, than an exception of the ca&s;es from the operation of tho&s;e provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not familiar with laws and treaties, may feel &s;ome difficulty about the po&s;ition, that particular clau&s;es are introduced, only for greater caution, without producing any new effect; but tho&s;e who are familiar with &s;uch &s;ubjects, know, that there is &s;carcely a law or a treaty which does not offer examples of the u&s;e of &s;imilar clau&s;es; and it not unfre|quently happens, that a clear meaning of the principal provi&s;ion is rendered ob&s;cure by the exce&s;s of explanatory precaution.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e of this article is an exception to the general de&s;ign of it, condfirming the con&s;truction I have given. "The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;hall, <HI>however,</HI> according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which &s;oever of the parties belonging, may freely be re&s;orted to and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ly in Great Britain."</P>
<P>If the general provi&s;ion gives acce&s;s to all our ports, which mu&s;t be the doctrine, if it gives acce&s;s to our Atlantic ports, then it would equally have this effect with regard to the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi.

<P>It may be u&s;eful to ob&s;erve here, that the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi ports being to be u&s;ed only in as ample, and not in a more ample manner, than our Atlantic ports and the ports of Great Britain, will be liable at all times to all the regulations, pei|vileges, and re&s;trictions of the ports with which they are a&s;&s;orted.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e is a &s;till further refutation of the con&s;truction which I oppo&s;e.</P>

<P>The words, <HI>"in the manner afore&s;aid,"</HI> occur twice in the&s;e clau&s;es, and their equivalent, <HI>"in like manner"</HI> once. What is the meaning of this &s;o often repeated phra&s;e? it cannot be pre|&s;umed, that it would have been in&s;erted &s;o frequently without having to perform &s;ome office of con&s;equence.

No other rea&s;ona|ble u&s;e can be found for the terms. If they are denied this &s;en&s;e, they had much better been omitted, as being not only u&s;ele&s;s, but as giving cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e a re&s;triction of what, it is pretended, was de&s;igned to be general&mdash;a right of importing in every way, and into all parts of the United States, goods and merchandize, if not entirely prohibited, on the &s;ame duties as are payable by our own citizens when brought in our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The&s;e words, "who&s;e importation into the United States &s;hall not be <HI>entirely</HI> prohibited," is a further key to the true &s;en&s;e of the article. They are equivalent to the&s;e other words, "who&s;e importation, <HI>into all parts</HI> of the United States &s;hall not be prohibited."&mdash;The de&s;ign o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this clau&s;e is to prevent im|portation, through the particular channels contemplated by the article, being ob&s;tructed by a partial or by any other than a general prohibition. As long as certain goods may be introduced into the United States through the Atlantic ports, they may al&s;o be brought into them through the channels delignated by this article, that is, by land and inland navigation. The making a prohibition in the given ca&s;e to depend on a general prohibi|tion, is conclu&s;ive to prove, that the article contemplates only <HI>particular channels.</HI> On any other &s;uppo&s;ition, the clau&s;e is non|&s;en&s;e. The true reading, then, of this part of the article, mu&s;t be as follows: "Goods and merchandize, who&s;e importation <HI>into all parts</HI> of the United States &s;hall not be prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame, <HI>in manner a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;aid,</HI> that is, <HI>by land and inland navigation,</HI> from the territories of his maje&s;ty on the continent of America."</P>
<P>There are &s;till other expre&s;&s;ions in the article, which are like|wi&s;e an index to its meaning. They are the&s;e, "<HI>would be pay|able</HI> by the citizens of the United States, on the <HI>importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid &s;tates.</HI>" This reference to a rate of duties, which would be pay|able on importation into the Atlantic ports, as a rule or guide for the rate of duties, which is to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an in the ca&s;e meant to be comprehended in the article, is full evidence that importation in the Atlantic ports is not included in that ca&s;e. The mention of importation in American ve&s;&s;els, confirms this conclu&s;ion
<PB N="190" REF="028389_0189_0FD8E8AE9B074408">as it &s;hows that the article it&s;elf contemplates, that the di&s;cri|mination made by our exi&s;ting laws may continue.</P>
<P>But the matter is put out of all doubt by tho&s;e parts of the fifteenth article which re&s;erve to the Briti&s;h government the right of impo&s;ing &s;uch duty as may be adequate to <HI>countes|vail the difference</HI> of duty, <HI>now payable</HI> on the importation a European and A&s;iatic goods, when imported into the Unites States in Briti&s;h and American ve&s;&s;els; and which &s;tipulate, that "the United States will not INCREASE <HI>the now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting difference</HI> between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els."</P>
<P>This is a demon&s;tration, that the treaty contemplates, as con&s;i&s;tent with it, a continuance of the pre&s;ent difference of duties on importations in American and Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els; and con&s;equently, that the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d article, which &s;tipulates equal du|ties, as to the ca&s;es within it, does not extend to importations into our Atlantic ports, but is confined to importations by land and inland navigation. Though this article be of temporary duration, yet as an evidence of the &s;en&s;e of the parties, it will always &s;erve as a rule of con&s;truction for every part of the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>The&s;e different views of the article e&s;tabli&s;h, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that, except with regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, inland trade and navigation are its &s;ole objects&mdash;that it gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> no right or privilege whatever in our Atlantic ports&mdash;and that with regard to the ports of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, it only e&s;tabli&s;hes this principle, that Great Britain &s;hall always enjoy there the &s;ame privileges which by treaty or law &s;he is allowed to have in our Atlantic ports.</P>
<P>I remark incidentally, for a purpo&s;e which will appear here|after, that as far as this article is concerned, we are free to prohibit the importation into the United States at large, of any Briti&s;h article whatever, though we cannot prohibit its impor|tation <HI>partially,</HI> that is, morely from her territories in our neighbourhood, by land or inland navigation; but we may prohibit the importation by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from tho&s;e territories; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there any other part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this is prevented.</HI></P>

<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with an ob&s;ervation or two on the meaning of the terms, inland navigation. The&s;e terms have no technical meaning defined in the laws of either coun|try, nor have they any preci&s;e meaning a&s;&s;igned by the law of nations. They, however, <HI>ex vi termini,</HI> exclude navigation from the &s;ea; and as a general rule, I &s;hould &s;ay, that inland navigation begins there, where &s;ea navigation ends. Where is this? I an&s;wer, at the ports of entry from the &s;ea. By the laws of Great Britain and of the United States, all rivers are arms of the &s;ea as far as the tides flow&mdash;It would be a con|&s;equence of this principle, that &s;ea navigation would reach to the head of tide water. But &s;ome more obvious and notorious rule ought to govern the interpretation of national compacts. The ports of entry from the &s;ea are conceived to be the pro|per rule.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, the general &s;pirit of the ar|ticle may require, that all the waters which divide the territo|ries of the parties &s;hould be in their whole extent common to both.&mdash;As to other communicating waters, acce&s;&s;ible under the article, the reciprocal limit of the right will be the ports of en|try from the &s;ea. This is to be under&s;tood with the exception of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, to the ports of which, acce&s;s from the &s;ea is granted under the qualification which has been pointed out.</P>

<P>THE foregoing analy&s;is of the third article, by fixing its true meaning, enables us to detect &s;ome gro&s;s errors, which have been principal &s;ources of prejudice again&s;t it.&mdash; One of the&s;e is, that the article gives to the other party a right of acce&s;s to all our ports, while it excludes us from the ports of the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in our neighbourhood.&mdash;It has
<PB N="192" REF="028389_0191_0FD8E8B18E30C060">been clearly &s;hown, that it gives no right of acce&s;s to any one of our Atlantic ports, and that it gives only a qualified and conditional acce&s;s to the ports which we may have on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, to be regulated by the privileges at any time allow|ed by law or compact in our Atlantic ports, and liable to cea&s;e with the ce&s;&s;ation of tho&s;e privileges.&mdash;The charge, there|fore, of want of reciprocity in this particular, vani&s;hes, and with it all the exceptionable con&s;equences which have been the fruit of the error. Such is the a&s;&s;ertion of DECIUS, that a Briti&s;h trader may &s;et out from Canada, traver&s;e our lakes, ri|vers and waters to New York, and thence to Philadelphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, while we are precluded from the navigation of the St. Law|rence, and other Briti&s;h rivers lower than the highe&s;t ports of entry from the &s;ea. It would be an indulgent con&s;truction of the article, not to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p the Briti&s;h trader at Hud&s;on, as the high|e&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, and the boundary of inland na|vigation; but he could certainly have no claim of right under it, to go from New York to Philadelphia, becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily go by &s;ea to arrive at the fir&s;t place, and no &s;uch per|mi&s;&s;ion is &s;tipulated by the article. Such, al&s;o, is the a&s;&s;ertion of CATO, that Great Britain is admitted to all the advantages of which our Atlantic rivers are &s;u&s;ceptible. The rivers, upon which no part of their territory borders, and which their ve&s;|&s;els can only approach by &s;ea, are certainly excepted.</P>
<P>Another of the errors referred to, is this, that goods and merchandize may, under this article, be imported into any <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt</HI> of the United States, upon the &s;ame duties as are now paya|ble when imported by citizens of the United States, and in ve&s;|&s;els of the United States. It has been clearly proved, that there is no pretence for this po&s;ition, and that equality of duties c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly applies to importations from the Briti&s;h territories, in our neigh|bourhood, by land and inland navigation.</P>
<P>CATO, DECIUS, and other writers again&s;t the treaty, have fall|en into this &s;trange error, and have founded upon it much angry declamation. The fir&s;t, however, embarra&s;&s;ed in his con&s;truc|tion, by the provi&s;ion which re&s;erves to Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Britain the right of laying countervailing du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, endeavours to e&s;cape from it by di&s;tingui&s;hing between goods imported for Indian trade, and tho&s;e imported for other u&s;es. Whatever may be the ca&s;e with regard to the latter, the former, he is convinced, are certainly entitled to admi&s;&s;ion into our Atlantic ports, on the privileged rights of duty; though he is very naturally perplexed to &s;ee how the di&s;crimination could be maintained in practice. But where does he find room for this di&s;tinction? Not in the pro|vi&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="193" REF="028389_0192_0FD8E8B4920E6FC0">in the clau&s;e of the third article, to which he gives the inter|pretation, for that is directly again&s;t his di&s;tinction. The goods and merchandize, for the privileged importation of which at provides, are re&s;tricted to no particular object&mdash;have no &s;pecial reference to Indian more than to other trade: on the contra|ry, they are expre&s;sly to be imported for "the purpo&s;es of commerce" at large; &s;o that in the ca&s;es in which they are privileged, they are equally &s;o, whether it be for a trade with our citizens or with Indians. The di&s;tinction therefore, only proves the embarra&s;&s;ment of its inventor, without &s;olving the difficulty. A curious a&s;&s;ertion has been made on this article of duties. It has been &s;aid, that while we are obliged to admit Briti&s;h goods on the &s;ame duties with tho&s;e paid by our own citizens, or importation in our own ve&s;&s;els, Great Britain, un|der the right to lay, countervailing duties, may incumber us with an additional ten per cent. Can any thing be more ab&s;urd than the po&s;ition, that the right to lay <HI>countervailing</HI> duties ex|i&s;ts in a ca&s;e, where there is no difference of duty to <HI>counter|vail?</HI> The term is manife&s;tly a relative one, and can only ope|rate where there is &s;omething on our &s;ide to be countervailed or counterbalanced, and in an exact ratio to it. If it be true, that a very high law character is the writer of CATO, we can|not but be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch extreme inaccuracy.</P>
<P>Other errors, no le&s;s con&s;iderable, will appear in the pro|gre&s;s of the examination; but it will facilitate the detection of the&s;e, and tend to a more thorough under&s;tanding of the ar|ticle, to &s;tate in this place &s;ome general facts, which are ma|terial in a compari&s;on of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the article, to the re&s;pective parties.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The fur trade within our limits is, to the fur trade with|in the Briti&s;h limits, as one to &s;even, nearly; that is, the trade with the Indians, on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the boundary line, is about &s;even times greater than the &s;ame trade on our &s;ide of that line. This fact is &s;tated as the re&s;ult of repeated enquiry from well informed per&s;ons for &s;everal years pa&s;t. It will not appear extraordinary to tho&s;e who recollect how much the In|dians on our &s;ide are circum&s;cribed in their hunting-grounds, and to what a degree they are reduced in numbers by the fre|quent wars, in which they have been engaged with us: while the tribes on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the line are not only far more numerous, but enjoy an immen&s;e undi&s;turbed range of wilder|ne&s;s. The more rapid progre&s;s of &s;ettlement on our &s;ide than on the other, will fa&s;t merea&s;e the exi&s;ting di&s;parity.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Our communication with the &s;ea is more ea&s;y, &s;afe, and expeditious, than that of Canada, by the St. Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence. Ac|cordingly,
<PB N="194" REF="028389_0193_0FD8E8B60C917010">while our ve&s;&s;els ordinarily make two voyages in a year, to and from Europe, the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, in the Canada trade, are, from the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons, and the nature of the navigation, confined to one voyage in a year. Though hi|therto, from temporary circum&s;tances, this difference has not made any &s;en&s;ible difference in the price of tran&s;portation; yet in its permanent operation, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not give us a material advantage in the competition for the &s;up|ply of European goods to a large part of Canada, e&s;pecially that which is denominated Upper Canada. The city of Hud|&s;on, di&s;tant 124 miles from the city of New York, is as near to the junction of the river Cataraquy and lake Ontario, as Montreal, which la&s;t is near four hundred miles di&s;tant from the mouth of the St. Lawrence. When the canals, now in rapid execution, are completed, there will be water communi|cation the whole way from the city of Hud&s;on to Ontario.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The &s;upply of Ea&s;t India goods to Canada, is likely to be always ea&s;ier and cheaper through us, than in any other way. According to the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem, Canada is &s;up|plied through Britain. It is obvious how much the charges of this double voyage mu&s;t enhance the prices of the articles, when delivered in Canada. A direct trade between the Ea&s;t Indies and Canada, would &s;uppo&s;e a change in the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem, to which there are great ob&s;tacles; and even then, there are circum&s;tances which would &s;ecure to us an advantage|ous competition.&mdash;It is a fact, which &s;erves to illu&s;trate our advantages, that Ea&s;t India articles, including teas, are, upon an average, cheaper in the United States than in England.</P>
<P>The facts demon&s;trate that a trade between us and the Bri|ti&s;h territories in our neighbourhood, upon equal terms as to privilege, mu&s;t afford a balance of advantages on our &s;ide. As to the fur trade, for a participation in one eighth of the whole, which we concede, we gain a participation in &s;even-eighths which is conceded to us. As to the European and Ea&s;t India trade, we acquire the right of competition upon equal terms of privilege with real and con&s;iderable advantages of &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulation with regard to equal duties, was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of our &s;uperiority of advantages in this trade, while it would not interfere with the general policy of our re|gulation, concerning the difference of duties on goods import|ed in our own and in foreign bottoms; becau&s;e the &s;upplies which can come to us through Canada, for the rea&s;ons already given, mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable&mdash;becau&s;e, al&s;o, di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tance would &s;oon coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;es of tran&s;portation, the effect of the defference of duties in our market&mdash;and becau&s;e, in the
<PB N="195" REF="028389_0194_0FD8E8BC119DE340">la&s;t place, this difference is not very &s;en&s;ible, owing to the large proportion of goods which are imported in the names of our own citizens. I &s;ay nothing here of the practicability, on general grounds, of long maintaining with effect this regula|tion.</P>
<P>Is it not wonderful, con&s;idering the real &s;tate of the trade, as depending on locality, that the treaty &s;hould be charged with &s;acrificing the fur trade to the Briti&s;h? If there be any &s;acrifice, is it not on their &s;ide: when the fact is, that the quantity of trade in which they admit us to equal privileges is &s;even times greater than that in which we admit them to equal privileges?</P>
<P>The arguments again&s;t the treaty on this point, are not only full of fal&s;ity, but they are in contradiction with each other.</P>
<P>On the one hand, it is argued that our communication from the &s;ea, with the Indian country, being much ea&s;ier than by the St. Lawrence, we could furni&s;h Engli&s;h goods cheaper, and of cour&s;e could have continued the Indian trade in its u&s;ual channel, even from the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes; nor could they have prevented it, without giving &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t to the Indi|ans, as would have made them dangerous neighbours.&mdash;On the other hand, it is argued, that from &s;uperiority of capital, better knowledge of the trade, a better e&s;tabli&s;hed connection of cu&s;tomers, the Briti&s;h will be able to &s;upplant us, even in our own territories, and to acquire a monopoly of the whole fur trade.</P>
<P>Propo&s;itions &s;o oppo&s;ite cannot all be true. Either the &s;up|po&s;ed faculty of &s;upplying Engli&s;h goods cheaper, which, it is &s;aid, would give as a command of the Indian trade, even on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes, not in the power of the Briti&s;h to prevent, overbalances the advantages which are &s;pecified on the other &s;ide, or it does not&mdash;If it does not, then it is not true, that it could draw to us the trade from the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes&mdash;If it does, then it is not true, that the Briti&s;h can &s;up|plant us in the trade on either &s;ide the lakes; much le&s;s that they can obtain a monopoly of it on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if it be true that the Briti&s;h could not prevent out trading with the Indians on their &s;ide, without giving them &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t as to make them dangerous to their neighbours; why is it not equally true, that we could not prevent their trading with the Indians on our &s;ide, without producing a &s;imilar effect?&mdash;And if they have re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y a &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tity of advan|tages, why would they not, on the principle of this argument, attract and divert the trade from us, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> right to
<PB N="196" REF="028389_0195_0FD8E8BD25C641F0">trade with the Indians in each other's territories had not been &s;tipulated?</P>
<P>The difficulty of re&s;training the Indians from trading at plea|&s;ure, is an idea well founded, as has been admitted in another place.&mdash;But there re&s;ult from it, &s;trong arguments in favor of reciprocation of privileges in the Indian trade, by treaty. One of them, its tendency to pre&s;erve peace and good under&s;tand|ing, has been already noticed; another ari&s;es from the con&s;i|deration, that it will probably be the policy of the Briti&s;h to maintain larger military e&s;tabli&s;hments on their frontier, than we &s;hall think eligible on ours, which will render it proportion|ably more ea&s;y to them to re&s;train their Indians, than it will be to us to re&s;train ours. This greater difficulty of excuting re&s;traints on our &s;ide, is a powerful rea&s;on for us to agree, mu|tually, to throw open the door.</P>
<P>It will not be &s;urpri&s;ing, if, upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion, the adver&s;aries of the treaty &s;hould abandon their own ground, and in&s;tead of &s;aying the treaty is faulty, for what it &s;tipulates on this point, &s;hould affirm, merely that it has no merit on this account, &s;ince it only does what the di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians would have brought about without it&mdash;But it is always a merit to dive&s;t an advantageous thing of cau&s;e of di&s;pute, and to fix, by amicable agreement, a benefit which otherwi&s;e would be liable to litigation, oppo&s;ition, and interruption.</P>
<P>As to relative advantages for carrying on the trade, the com|pari&s;on ought to be made with caution. That which has been &s;tated on our &s;ide, namely, greater facility in conveying the materials of the trade from Europe to the &s;cene where it is to be carried on, is a real one, and in proce&s;s of time may be expected to make it&s;elf to be felt; yet hitherto, as before ob|&s;erved, it has had no &s;en&s;ible effect.</P>
<P>Of the advantages which have been &s;tated as belonging to the other &s;ide, there is but one which has &s;ub&s;tance, and this is previous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground. But even this, from the very nature of it, is temporary&mdash;With our u&s;ual enterpri&s;e and indu&s;try, it will be a&s;toni&s;hing if we do not &s;peedily &s;hare the ground to the full extent of our relative advantages.</P>
<P>As to &s;uperiority of capital, it amounts to nothing. It has been &s;een, that the capital requi&s;ite for the whole trade is &s;mall. From a hundred to a hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling would be a high &s;tatement.&mdash;The whole of this, if we were to monopolize the entire trade, could not create a moment's embarra&s;&s;ment to find it, in the opinion of any man who attends to the great pecuniary operations which are daily going on in our country. But that very capital which it
<PB N="197" REF="028389_0196_0FD8E8BECECEEC90">repre&s;ented as our rival, could be brought into action for our benefit in this very trade. The &s;olution is &s;imple. Our credit will command it in obtaining the foreign articles, nece&s;&s;ary for the trade, upon as good terms as the Briti&s;h merchants who now carry it on. The &s;ame objection of &s;uperiority of capital may with as much rea&s;on be applied to any other branch of trade between us and Great Britain. Why does it not give her a monopoly of the direct trade between her European do|minions and the United States? The argument, if valid, would prove that we ought to have no commerce, not only with Great Britain, but with any nation which has more com|mercial capital than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to &s;uperior knowledge of the particular branch of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, there is &s;till le&s;s force in that argument. It is not a ca&s;e of ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience or complicated combination. And we are in no want of per&s;ons among us, who are experimentally ac|quainted with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As to cu&s;tomers for the proceeds of the trade, we &s;hould &s;tand upon as good a footing as the Briti&s;h merchants. What we did not want for our own con&s;umption, might be &s;ent up|on equal terms to the very markets to which they &s;end theirs; and to others which might be found preferable, becau&s;e le&s;s well &s;upplied with the kind of articles.</P>
<P>As to whatever may depend on enterpri&s;e, we need not fear to be out-done by any people on earth. It may almo&s;t be &s;aid, that enterpri&s;e is our element.</P>
<P>It has been alleged, that our trade with the Indians would be interrupted by bad &s;ea&s;ons and occa&s;ional wars, while that of Great Britain would be &s;teady and uniform. As to the ca|&s;ualties of &s;ea&s;ons, it is evident they mu&s;t fall upon Great Britain as much as upon us, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the elements in con&s;piracy again&s;t us; and as to wars, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts would e&s;&s;entially change our &s;ituation, and render it pe|culiarly advantageous for preventing or repre&s;&s;ing ho&s;tilities; &s;o that with equally good management, our territories would not be more expo&s;ed than the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>But the intrigues of the Briti&s;h traders re&s;iding among our Indians, would excite them to ho&s;tility. It could not be the private intere&s;t of the traders to do this; becau&s;e, be&s;ides be|ing amenable to puni&s;hment, if di&s;covered&mdash;be&s;ides, that both the traders and the Indians within our limits, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts, would be under our controul&mdash;wars interrupt of cour&s;e the hunting of the Indians, and &s;o de&s;troy their means of trading.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="028389_0197_0FD8E8BFD3E86F80">
As to Great Britain, &s;he never could have had but one in|tere&s;t to prompt Indian ho&s;tilities, that was, to induce the United States to relinqui&s;h a part of their boundary. The re|&s;titution of the po&s;ts will put an end to this project. In regard to trade, &s;he and her traders will have a common intere&s;t with us, and our traders, to keep all the Indians at peace, for the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned above. This intere&s;t will be the &s;tronger, be|cau&s;e the be&s;t communication even with her own Indians, will be partly through our territery; and it would be impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not be impeded and interrupted by the operations of war between us and the Indians In fact, under the circum|&s;tance of common privileges, there is every po&s;&s;ible link of common intere&s;t between us and Great Britain in the pre&s;er|vation of peace with the Indians.</P>
<P>In this que&s;tion of danger to our peace by the Briti&s;h parti|cipation in the trade with our Indians, the difficulty of re|&s;training the Indians from trading with whom they plea&s;e (which is admitted by the argument of both &s;ides) is a very material con&s;ideration. Would there not be greater hazard to our peace from the attempts of the Briti&s;h to participate in a trade from which we endeavoured to exclude them, &s;econded by the di&s;contents of the Indians, than from any di&s;po&s;itions to &s;upplant us, when allowed a free competition, when as cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction was given to the Indians, and when it was certain, that war mu&s;t interfere with their means of car|rying on the trade? The &s;ecurity for our peace appears to be much greater in the latter, than in the former &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;picion is al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted, that Great Britain, without exciting war, will indirectly trammel and ob&s;truct our trade. To objections which &s;uppo&s;e a want of fair dealing in the other party, it is very difficult to an&s;wer. All that a treaty can do, is to e&s;tabli&s;h principles which are likely to operate well, if well executed. It is no objection to its merits, that the benefits aimed at may be fru&s;trated by ill faith. The utility of any compact between nations mu&s;t pre&s;ume a &s;incere execution. The rever&s;e may di&s;appoint the be&s;t conceived plan: and the &s;ecurity again&s;t it mu&s;t be the mutual intere&s;t to perform, and the power of retaliation. If Great Britain acts with infidelity or chicanery towards us, we mu&s;t retract the privileges granted on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>Another objection which is made, is, that while the Briti&s;h would have a right to re&s;ide among us, to hire hou&s;es and warehou&s;es, and to enjoy every convenience for pro&s;ecuting the trade &s;y&s;tematically, we &s;hould not be entitled to &s;imilar privileges with them, having only a right to pa&s;s "like pedlars
<PB N="199" REF="028389_0198_0FD8E8C14FE580F8">with our &s;hops upon our backs." The&s;e are the expre&s;&s;ions of CATO.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition is founded on that clau&s;e of the Briti&s;h act of navigation, which forbids any but a natural born or naturalized &s;ubject to exerci&s;e the occupation of a merchant or factor, in any of the Briti&s;h dominions in A&s;ia, Africa and America.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is to be ob&s;erved, that as far as the ar|ticle under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is &s;ingly concerned, there is no pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ence to &s;ay, that one party has greater rights as to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce than the other. If, therefore, Great Britain can prevent our citi|zens re&s;iding in their territories in our neighbourhood, we are free by this article to apply to them a &s;imilar exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ion. And any right of re&s;idence which may be claimed under any other part of the treaty, will be temporary.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the prohibition of re&s;idence in the act of navigation, proceeds on the ground of excluding foreigners from carrying on trade in the territories to which it extends. But the third article expre&s;sly gives us a right freely to carry on trade and commerce with the Briti&s;h territories on this conti|nent, a right which nece&s;&s;arily includes the privilege of re&s;id|ing as merchants and factors. For wherever an END is granted, the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> and <HI>proper means</HI> of enjoying it, are implied in the grant. Re&s;idence is a u&s;ual and nece&s;&s;ary mean of freely carry|ing on trade. Without it, the right to trade becomes e&s;&s;entially nugatory. This rea&s;oning has peculiar force in relation to inland trade. And it agrees with deci&s;ions at common law, and with the opinion of Lord Coke, who tells us that "of an hou&s;e for <HI>habitation</HI> an alien merchant may take a <HI>lea&s;e for years, as inci|dent to commerce; for without habitation be cannot merchandize or trade."</HI> This, among other things, he informs us, was re&s;olv|ed by all the judges a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e, in the ca&s;e of &s;ir James Cro&s;t, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and we learn from it, that the right to hire hou&s;es and warehou&s;es is deriv|ed from the right to trade, as its incident. The &s;ame princi|ple, <HI>in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> has been recognized in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The whole of the article is an innovation upon the Briti&s;h act of navig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion. Being abrogated as to the principal thing, there is no difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;o as to incidents; on the other hand, to pretend to exclude us from the right of re|&s;idence, could not be deemed a fair execution of the article. Hence we find, that the want of reciprocity in this particular, al&s;o fails, and with it the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;advantage on our &s;ide in the &s;uppo&s;ed competition for the trade.</P>

<P>WE, the under&s;igned citizens of the United States, in|habitants of Baltimore town, beg leave re&s;pectfully to repre&s;ent, that the treaty lately negociated with Great Bri|tain, and announced to us through the public prints, has ex|cited in our minds the mo&s;t &s;erious apprehen&s;ion and alarm for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of our commerce, the rights of our fellow citizens, and the dignity of our government. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, convinced as we are, of your unremitting concern for the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of America, we think it our duty to di&s;clo&s;e to you, freely, our &s;entiments on the &s;ub|ject, le&s;t our &s;ilence might be interpreted into an approval of the act, and to prevent, as far as the influence of our opinions may operate, a ratification of it.</P>
<P>A treaty that profe&s;&s;es to e&s;tabli&s;h a firm, la&s;ting, and in|violable peace, and &s;incere friend&s;hip between the contracting parties, without referring to their re&s;pective complaints, and as far as may be, removing them, wants that evidence of a paci|fic

It contemplates an incon&s;i&s;tent e&s;tabli&s;hment or colony of men within the terri|tory and juri&s;diction of the United States, enjoying &s;ome of the mo&s;t important privileges of citizens, but exempt from the burdens, and owing no allegiance to its government. Many mi&s;chiefs, we conceive, might re&s;ult from &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; among which, from the evident want of reciprocity, in the advantages of navigation ceded in the lakes, and other we&s;tern waters, may ju&s;tly be apprehended, the monopoly of a lucrative fur trade, by this de&s;cription of &s;ettlers. From the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h &s;hips to be the carriers of our bulky pro|ducts, on terms of perfect equality with our own, we antici|pate a material lo&s;s in the value of our &s;hipping; and con&s;e|quently, a great injury to a numerous cla&s;s of people employed in &s;hip-building, and in the manufacture of cordage, iron, and other articles, nece&s;&s;ary to this exten&s;ive branch of bu&s;ine&s;s; and we fear what is contemplated as an equivalent for this im|portant &s;acrifice, will not be found &s;uch in fact.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="028389_0201_0FD8E8CC95B90CE8">
We cannot view but with the mo&s;t lively concern and regret, that article of the treaty, which authorizes the &s;eizure of ene|mies' property in neutral &s;hips. This is a ce&s;&s;ion of va&s;t im|portance to America as a trading nation. Situate as &s;he is, re|mote from the powers of Europe; pacific in the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of her citizens, and in the principles of her govern|ment; &s;he is not likely to be embroiled in wars. The ad|vantages, then, that would re&s;ult from her being the carrier of property for the contending nations, are too evident to re|quire elucidation, and too important to be given up without an equivalent. The principle of free &s;hips making free goods has been formally acknowledged by the government of the United States to other neutral powers, when &s;he was engaged in war&mdash;It has been granted to her by treaties with different na|tions: it has long been contended for, and has been acknow|ledged by &s;everal of the re&s;pectable powers of Europe. By giving up this point, to a nation &s;o frequently engaged in wars, we give our con&s;ent to the mo&s;t vexatious and injurious re|&s;trictions on our commerce, and of our national rights as a neutral nation, without any thing that can be called an equi|valent.</P>
<P>America is not in a condition, to benefit by the apparent reci|procity in this article of the treaty; nor likely &s;oon to be in a &s;ituation that will require it.</P>
<P>We have doubts of the policy, on our part, of agreeing to that article which precludes the United States from entering into treaties, incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome of its provi&s;ions, whereby America would be prevented from a renewal of her beneficial treaties, exi&s;ting with the French Republic, and other European powers; and from making &s;uch other treaties at any future period, as may be deemed advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>To enumerate minutely, the many evils which may be ap|prehended from a treaty, &s;o partial and unequal in is provi&s;i|ons, and wherein man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our ju&s;t complaints are entirely un|notic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, would be unnece&s;&s;arily tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on your time; and to point out defects which we are per&s;uaded will not have e&s;caped your notice. We, therefore, content our&s;elves with the ob&s;ervations we have already made; adding only, that we re|tain the mo&s;t grateful remembrance of your &s;teady, enlightened patrioti&s;m, which has &s;aved our republic from impending ruin, on many memorable occa&s;ions; and that we look to you as our only hope of deliverance from the evils we anticipate in an adoption of the propo&s;ed treaty; earne&s;tly entreating you to with-hold the &s;anction of your name, from a compact evidently &s;o unju&s;t, and &s;o derogatory to the intere&s;t and dignity of America.</P>

<P>ON Augu&s;t 5th, 1795, a re&s;pectable number of people, from various parts of the county, met together in Morris Town, by previous notice, for the purpo&s;e of con&s;idering whe|ther it would not be expedient to call a general meeting of the county, in order to deliberate upon the treaty of com|merce, &amp;c. pending between the United States and Great Britain, and to take the &s;en&s;e of the people, then a&s;&s;embled, on &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d treaty.</P>
<P>The treaty was read, a number of forcible objections were made to it, and it was agreed, <HI>one voice di&s;&s;enting,</HI> that a gene|ral meeting of the county &s;hould be called on Saturday the 15th in&s;tant. A committe of nine was appointed, and reque&s;ted to draw up &s;uch addre&s;s to the pre&s;ident of the United States, as would be mo&s;t &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, to be pre&s;ented at the en&s;uing meeting, for the approbation of the people. The mode|rator and clerk were reque&s;ted to give notice of &s;aid meeting by adverti&s;ements in the county, and in the Newark and Eliza|beth Town papers.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the afore&s;aid notice, on Augu&s;t 15th, the peo|ple a&s;&s;embled at the court hou&s;e of the county, and proceeded to elect a moderator and clerk; the treaty was read and con|&s;idered&mdash; objections were &s;tated, and no reply was made in con|tradiction to them: the committee then handed forward their report, which was read and con&s;idered, and is as follows.&mdash;</P>

<P>We apprehend it would be an unnece&s;&s;ary intru&s;ion on the time and patience of the pre&s;ident, to enumerate and &s;tate, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ticularly, all the objections that occur in reading and con&s;idering this extraordinary diplomatic in&s;trument, e&s;pecially as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of them have been de&s;ignated, and as we are informed, been already pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ident from various parts of the continent.</P>
<P>We cannot, however, but ob&s;erve in general, that the argu|ment urged by the advocates of the treaty appears to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|founded, viz, That the unequal conce&s;&s;ions and &s;acrifices made therein by America to Great Britain, are the nece&s;&s;ary price of peace with her. If this po&s;ition were true, it remains a doubt whether the price would not far exceed the purcha&s;e. We would farther ob&s;erve, that on the ratification of this treaty, we have no other &s;ecurity for the delivery of the we&s;tern p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in June, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than we had for the evacuation of them with <HI>all convenient &s;peed,</HI> as &s;tipulated in the treaty of peace of 1783.

Nor do we conceive, that we &s;hall by this treaty be more &s;ecure in our commerce than neutral ve&s;&s;els were by the law of nations under the recognition of our independence; nor can we extend our credulity in the faith of that nation &s;o far, as to &s;uppo&s;e that our naval commerce will be le&s;s abridged by them, or our &s;eamen le&s;s expo&s;ed to in&s;ult than heretofore, unle&s;s we wholly relinqui&s;h all trade with her enemies a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndall others, where it may interfere with her intere&s;t.

<P>If the horrors of war, which we &s;incerely deprecate, are to be &s;et in competition with the lo&s;s of our natural rights and privileges, we are not able to di&s;tingui&s;h the advantages to be derived from a treaty which &s;ubmits them, rather than to have them taken from us without. The latter &s;eems to us preferable; as in that ca&s;e, whenever we thought fit and proper, and cir|cum&s;tances were favorable, we might a&s;&s;ert our right without being &s;tared in the face by a treaty that had previou&s;ly re&s;igned them. Be&s;ides, &s;tipulations &s;o manife&s;tly unju&s;t and unequal (though the temper and circum&s;tances of the moment may pro|cure a ratification) will not fail to be a continued &s;ource of di&s;|&s;atisfaction and complaint, and produce mutual infractions of the treaty, and mo&s;t probably will accelerate rather than retard ho&s;tilities between the contracting parties.</P>
<P>From our pre&s;ent view of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ct, and with a &s;incere de&s;ire to &s;erve and promote the be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;t of our country, in full confidence that the pre&s;ident of the United States will exer|ci&s;e that prudence and precaution with which his command and exalted admini&s;tration has ever been di&s;tingui&s;hed, we intreat that he will <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> &s;u&s;pend the final ratification of the &s;aid treaty with Great Britain, until the people of the United States &s;hall a&s;&s;emble in congre&s;s by their repre&s;entatives, and by them be advi&s;ed on a matter &s;o intere&s;ting and important.</P>
<P>No objections being offered again&s;t the above report, it was Unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That the people do approve of &s;aid report, and enjoin it upon the moderator of this meeting to
<PB N="206" REF="028389_0205_0FD8E8D70BD0CF90">perform the re&s;olution, therein contained, of having the &s;ame &s;peedily conveyed to the pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>

<P>EVERY time I read the treaty, new objections occur, or old ones penetrate deeper into the &s;ubject. Did you ever ob&s;erve the effect of the latter clau&s;e of the 7th article, as it a&s;&s;erts a claim on the part of the United States again&s;t France for whatever &s;hall be paid under it to Great Britain? In Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Mr. Genet, he &s;ays "Unle&s;s ve&s;&s;els captured as the 7th article &s;tates, &s;hall be re&s;tored, if the United States make compen&s;ation for them, they will con&s;ider the &s;ums paid as autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing a claim on the part of the United States again&s;t France." It is remembered, that Genet a&s;&s;erted a right on the part of France, to arm privateers in our ports, under the French treaty. This di&s;pute has never been adju&s;ted between the United States and France; when then the treaty &s;urrenders to Great Britain an equivalent for the captures made by French ve&s;&s;els, in order to charge France with the amount of that equivalent, not to apprize our friend and ally, that &s;uch a circum&s;tance was meditated before it was agreed to, is an unju&s;t procedure towards France, and tends to involve us in a di&s;agreeable altercation with that nation.</P>

<P>General Frederick Frelinghuy&s;en, one of the &s;enators of this &s;tate in the congre&s;s of the United States, attended, and, at the reque&s;t of the citizens pre&s;ent, con&s;ented to give his &s;enti|ments on the treaty pending between the United States and Great Britain.</P>
<P>The following re&s;olution was then moved by the Rev. Mr. Arm&s;tong, and &s;econded by Mr. C. &s;t</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That this meeting have the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lle&s;t confidence in the honor, virtue and integrity of the &s;aid Frederick Fre|linghuy&s;en &mdash;that this meeting are fully of opinion, that in vot|ing for &s;aid treaty, he acted on the pure&s;t principle of patriot|i&s;m; and that the thanks of this meeting be given to him, for the candor with which he has &s;tated the rea&s;ons which induced him to vote for the &s;aid treaty."</P>
<P>This re&s;olution was objected to by Mr. Mott and Mr. Throck|morton, upon the principle, that it might be deemed by the public as an implied contradiction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the vote of the former town meetings, di&s;approving of the &s;aid treaty&mdash;which contra|diction it was evident this meeting did not mean to make; that all that was intended, was to acquit Gen.

<P>It was an&s;wered by Mr. R. Stockton, that nothing more was meant or intended; and that, from a view of the re&s;olu|tion, it could not po&s;&s;ibly be taken to be a contradiction of the vote of the former meetings, in di&s;approbation of the treaty.&mdash;
<PB N="208" REF="028389_0207_0FD8E8DFEDD8A220">Mr. Craft, in particular, declared, that if he could imagine that it could be con&s;trued in any manner to contradict the vote of the former meeting, he &s;hould hardly have been &s;o incon&s;i&s;t|ent with him&s;elf as to have &s;econded the motion; and that he would &s;till vote again&s;t it with all his heart; for that Gen.

<P>In reply, it was ob&s;erved, that if nothing more was intend|ed, there could be no rea&s;on again&s;t &s;tating the re&s;olution in &s;uch terms as to avoid all doubt about the meaning.</P>
<P>But it was in&s;i&s;ted on by Mr. R. Stockton, and &s;everal others, that the que&s;tion &s;hould be put upon the re&s;olution a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;tood.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion was accordingly put by the chairman, and <HI>lo&s;t by a very large majority.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon it was moved by Mr. Throckmorton, and &s;e|conded by Mr. Craft, that the re&s;olution be amended &s;o as to read as follows, viz.</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE article relative to the trade of India, is in it&s;elf of too little moment to require much of our attention. The fact, with re&s;pect to that trade, is, that as the merchandizes carried to India con&s;i&s;t of commodities which the European nations cannot conveniently &s;upply, together with money and nece&s;&s;aries for refitting their &s;hips: As the proceeds of the&s;e cargoes are employed in purcha&s;ing India goods from the fac|tors of the European nation at who&s;e port we trade, there is a clear pro&s;it in admitting us freely to their ports, and thereby rendering &s;uch ports the entrepots between the United States and India. Should one nation only do this, and the others ex|clude us, the one that admitted our ve&s;&s;els, would thereby ac|quire a double pro&s;it; fir&s;t, upon the India goods &s;old to us; &s;econd, upon the &s;ale of the commodities we brought them. This is &s;o well under&s;tood by all the European nations that have e&s;tabli&s;hments in India, that our ve&s;&s;els are freely admitted into their ports (a very few excepted, that have a monopoly of a particular commodity) and France has put our trade with hers upon the mo&s;t favorable footing. The re&s;trictions in the treaty have thus <HI>narrowed,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>enlarging,</HI> our advantages in trading to the Briti&s;h factories; but as all the others are open to us, &s;he will be compelled to receive us or lo&s;e our commerce; and as her ports afford no peculiar advantage, neither the one nor the other merits our attention: the article, as far as it goes, is not good; but one can hardly call it bad, when connected with the re&s;t of the treaty; the deficiency of grace in a &s;ingle feature does not attract our notice, when the whole face is &s;trikingly deformed.</P>
<P>I proceed now to examine the effect of the treaty upon the commerce of this country when Britain &s;hall be at war. It will be admitted, that the nature of our government, and our &s;itu|ation, remote from the polities and intere&s;ts of ambitious pow|ers in Europe, will enable us for the mo&s;t part to live in peace. It will al&s;o be admitted, that a maritime nation that cultivates peace, may add greatly to her commerce and navigation, if
<PB N="220" REF="028389_0219_0FD8E901D59511F8">&s;he can carry on her trade with the belligerent powers, while theirs is dimini&s;hed by the conflict. In order to do this, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;he &s;hould be able to make the powers at war re&s;pect her flag, and the rights of neutrality.</P>
<P>With this view, therefore, commercial nations have always endeavored by treaty, to protect their commerce from the inter|ruptions which the principles of the old law of nations (now indeed &s;ufficiently exploded) afforded either of the belligerent powers a pretence to interpo&s;e. In looking back thro' the trea|ties which the nations of Europe have for one hundred and fifty years pa&s;t formed, with a view to this object, we find principles laid down and e&s;tabli&s;hed by them, in the&s;e re&s;pects totally different from the rules which the writers on the law of nations, borrowing their maxims from barbarous ages, have recorded. For it &s;hould be remembered, that the law of nati|ons is no written code, but a collection of tho&s;e principles which govern the conduct of civilized nations, with re&s;pect to each other; which principles can only be collected from their practice, and the theory e&s;tabli&s;hed by their treaties: and as the laws of a community are calculated to promote the intere&s;t of the members of that community, and are repealed or go into di&s;u&s;e when they are found not to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, &s;o the laws of nations al&s;o change with their refinements and civi|lization. If, therefore, a man were to look into the laws of any ancient &s;tate, he would find many things that would appear to him ab&s;urd, and contrary to humanity, which &s;till main|tained their place in the &s;tatute book. Thus in England, be would find the trial by Battle Laws again&s;t Witchcraft, and a variety of ridiculous local cu&s;toms, which would greatly &s;hoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his feelings, until he was told that all this tra&s;h had gone into di&s;u&s;e, though the laws were never formally repealed.</P>
<P>So, in looking into the writings upon the laws of nations, be would find attempts upon the common rights of humanity, upon the independence of neutral nations, ju&s;tified by the max|ims of writers, who, for the mo&s;t part, are pedants that reve|rence antiquity, and make no allowance for the change that the increa&s;ed commerce and intercour&s;e of nations have occa&s;ioned. Thus Vattel, to ju&s;tify the capture of ve&s;&s;els going to a blockaded port, tells us, that Demetrius, about two thou|&s;and years ago, hung the pilot and mariners of a ve&s;&s;el that carried provi&s;ions to Athens, which he had blockaded. The writers on the laws of nations in Algiers, could ju&s;tify their practice by more recent and valid precedents But when we look into the practice of nations, we find that their &s;entiments, expre&s;&s;ed in all their treaties, for a &s;eries of years, have refuted
<PB N="221" REF="028389_0220_0FD8E9076BDE87A0">the&s;e opinions, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a code more con&s;onant to rea&s;on and humanity. To &s;trengthen tho&s;e laws, is peculiarly the duty and intere&s;t of a nation, that will probably be &s;eldom engaged in a war, and always deeply intere&s;ted in the freedom of com|mence and navigation. As far back, therefore, as the year 1630, and ever &s;ince, I find the commercial nations declaring by treaty, what &s;hall be con&s;idered as contraband, and limiting this &s;trictly to arms and ammunition, and in&s;truments of war, actually made up for that purpo&s;e; &s;tipulating that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods&mdash;declaring that full credit &s;hall be given is &s;hip's papers; that armed ve&s;&s;els &s;hall not come within can|non &s;hot of a neutral &s;hip, but &s;end their boat on board, with only three men at mo&s;t, to examine papers, but not &s;earch.&mdash; In &s;hort, the treaties for one hundred and forty years back, rela|tive to this object, are drawn in the <HI>very words</HI> of the treaty between the United States and France; as they are again re|peated in the late treaty between England and France. For this &s;triking &s;imilarity I refer to the treaty between Spain and the United Provinces, in 1650, and to a long &s;eries of conventions between various nations &s;ince; in which I can &s;afely declare, I have not yet, after the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch, found a &s;ingle treaty in which the &s;ame latitude is given to the word <HI>contraband,</HI> as Mr. Jay has given it in his treaty with Lord Grenville: no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have I met with one, though &s;uch po&s;&s;ibly may exi&s;t, in which as provi&s;ion is made to guard the neutral &s;hip from &s;earch and &s;poliation.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd article of the treaty between Great Bri|tain and France, confines the word, contraband, to arms, ammu|nition, and military &s;tores; and the twenty-third article expre&s;sly excludes cordage, &s;ails, tar, ro&s;in, pitch, ma&s;ts for &s;hips, plank, timber of all hinds, and all other things proper for either building or repairing &s;hips.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principles are followed in our treaty with France, Holland and Sweden, and the &s;ame, as I have &s;tated, are to be found in treaties near one hundred and fifty years back; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding a loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ion in Vattel, velative to naval &s;tores, we may con&s;ider it as now &s;ettled by the uniform ac|knowledgment of nations, as expre&s;&s;ed in their treaties, that contraband mu&s;t, in its nature, be confined to arms and military &s;tores. But were it otherwi&s;e, as the object of every treaty is to gain &s;ome advantage which you did not before enjoy by the laws of nations, or to remove &s;ome doubt which might be enter|tained on tho&s;e laws; no nation ever enters into a treaty in or|der to enforce an e&s;tabli&s;hed law, unle&s;s that law is beneficial to it. What then could Mr. Jay's inducement be, after we had
<PB N="222" REF="028389_0221_0FD8E9076EC55F98">obtained from France, Holland and Sweden, expre&s;s &s;tipulations exempting naval &s;tores, &amp;c. from the li&s;t of contraband&mdash;After three great nations of Europe had, by their treaties, and by their formal acce&s;&s;ion to the principles of the armed neutrality, declared that the&s;e articles were <HI>not</HI> contraband&mdash;after Britain had at length made the &s;ame recognition by her treaty with France&mdash;after the pre&s;ident of the United States had expre&s;sly, in his proclamation, referred to the <HI>modern law</HI> of nations for the meaning of the word contraband, and in his enumeration of contraband articles, had excepted all tho&s;e that are excepted in our treaty with France&mdash;I &s;ay, what could be Mr. Jay's inducement to declare, in the 18th article of his treaty, the following &s;taple commodities of this country contraband&mdash; "Al&s;o timber for &s;hip-building, tar or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp, and cordage, <HI>and generally whatever may &s;erve di|rectly for the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron and fir pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds only excepted?</HI>" Is there any reciprocity in this &s;tipulation? Was it probable that the United States would &s;oon be at war with any nation, to whom Britain would carry the&s;e commodities? Was not Britain already at war with a nation who furni&s;hes us a good market for them? Are they not &s;taples of our coun|try, which we have a very con&s;iderable intere&s;t in &s;hipping? What equivalent does the treaty hold out to us for relinqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> this important branch of commerce? Is it u&s;ual for nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> compliment away their commerce without any equivalent? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Jay a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e were contraband by the <HI>modern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> nations? Will he give the lie to the pre&s;ident's public declara|tion, that they were not? Or is common politene&s;s too much for our own executive, while the mo&s;t &s;ervile adulation it lavi&s;hed on the monarch of Britain? But &s;uppo&s;ing that they were actually contraband, had we not a right to expect that Britain would agree to their exemption from that character is her treaty with us, as &s;he had done in her treaty with her n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ral enemy&mdash;and as France, and every other nation with whom we have treaties, had done with us when we were in a much le&s;s important &s;tate, than we are at pre&s;ent? Do not the com|mon principles of humanity, and the intere&s;ts of all commer|cial nations, combine in &s;triving to narrow the evils of was, and le&s;&s;en its effects on neutral nations? The venerable Frank|lin, with this view, in&s;erted in his treaty with Sweden, a &s;tip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lation for an uninterrupted commerce in private &s;hips, even if the contracting parties were at war with each other; but the chief ju&s;tice of the United States thinks it his duty to &s;top the progre&s;s of civilization, and to recall the barbari&s;m of pa&s;t ages, even at the expen&s;e of the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of his country. What

If he was to allege, that you had, in this article, violated the rights of nations, and done all in your power to re-plunge us into that &s;tate of barbari&s;m from which we had &s;o happily emerged?

<P>N. B. An inaccuracy of expre&s;&s;ion in &s;ome of my former numbers, may induce a belief, that the di&s;criminating duty on foreign bottoms is ten per cent. on the <HI>value of the cargo,</HI> when, in fact, it is only ten and an half per cent. on the amount of the duty; or, in other words, one-tenth additional duty.</P>

<P>IT has been u&s;ual in treaties, to confine every di&s;tinct mat|ter to a &s;eparate article: thus the 22d article of the treaty between France and Britain, declares what is contraband; the 23d article expre&s;sly &s;pecifies the exceptions. But Lord Gren|ville's treaty, as if with a view to render the &s;ubject as ob|&s;cure as po&s;&s;ible, crouds a variety of di&s;tinct matter into the &s;ame article, which makes it much more difficult to rea&s;on on the &s;ubject, unle&s;s the reader will be at the trouble of turning to the article at the time that he hears the commentary upon it. The article before us contains three di&s;tinct matters; fir&s;t, it enumerates contraband, without excepting any one article &s;hipped from the United States, other than unwrought iron and <HI>fir plank;</HI> as is u&s;ually done in &s;imilar ca&s;es, and which would have been peculiarly proper in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the &s;weeping words, "and generally whatever may &s;erve di|rectly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els;"&mdash;words of &s;uch extent as to include a very con&s;iderable portion of our exports, which by this article, are to be forfeited.</P>
<P>The &s;econd member of this article is extremely difficult to define. I &s;hall, therefore, give the very words of the treaty, that every reader may judge for him&s;elf, and if he can peru&s;e them without the mo&s;t lively emotion, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to
<PB N="224" REF="028389_0223_0FD8E90EE7DB3F40">declare, that he is no <HI>native</HI> American. "And whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> difficulty of agreeing on the preci&s;e ca&s;es, in which, alone, <HI>pro|vi&s;ions and other articles,</HI> not generally contraband, may be re|garded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the in|conveniencies and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e; it is further agreed, that whenever &s;uch articles, &s;o becoming contraband, according to the exi&s;ting law of nations, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, for that rea&s;on, be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be con&s;idered c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|cated; but the owners thereof &s;hall be &s;peedily and compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly indemnified," &amp;c.&mdash;The fir&s;t member provides that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a ve&s;&s;el's going to a blockaded port, &s;he &s;hall not be con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, till after <HI>notice</HI> of &s;uch blockade.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, then, does not refer to the ca&s;e of a port which is blockaded; but mu&s;t refer to &s;ome other ca&s;es, in which Mr. Jay admits, that <HI>provi&s;ions and other articles, not u&s;ually contra|band,</HI> may be rendered &s;uch. Now I know of no ca&s;e in which provi&s;ions, and more e&s;pecially other articles not u&s;ually contra|band, can be con&s;idered as &s;uch. It is true, Vattel has this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;&s;ion in the enumeration of contraband: "Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es meme en certaines occa&s;ions o&ugrave; l'on e&s;pere de reduire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> par la famine." "Even provi&s;ions where they hope to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the enemy by famine." I have &s;hewn that great change<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have taken place in modern times with re&s;pect to the laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ons; that every nation has, in its treaties, expre&s;sly exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> provi&s;ions; and that England has her&s;elf done &s;o in her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> treaty, even with France. But admitting Vattel's words in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> utmo&s;t latitude, they can only refer to the ca&s;e of a place block|aded; and this is referred to in another part of the article, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore not intended by this, which alludes to &s;ome <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>If there are really ca&s;es to which it can properly apply, in|dependent of a blockaded place, as the object related to the whole remaining trade of America (that in lumber and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tores having been before ceded) &s;urely it was the duty of our mini&s;ter, particularly as he was a lawyer, and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed competent to the &s;ubject, to have &s;pecified tho&s;e ca&s;es as accu|rately as po&s;&s;ible, and to have confined them to the narrowed po&s;&s;ible limits, where any doubts could have been entertained on the &s;ubject: this was nece&s;&s;ary, not only to put his countrymen upon their guard, to enable them to make &s;ome e&s;timate of their ri&s;k and lo&s;s; but to point out to them the ca&s;es in which they might appeal with &s;ucce&s;s. But, &s;ays the treaty "it is dif|ficult preci&s;ely to determine the ca&s;es." Why &s;o, &s;ir? Are the ca&s;es &s;o very numerous, or are they &s;o doubtful? If both, or either, they called for the more care and accuracy in the enu|meration
<PB N="225" REF="028389_0224_0FD8E9155B0CAAD8">and definition. Are they not ultimately to be decided &s;ome where? Or is the difficulty of deciding, to ju&s;tify the cap|ture of every American ve&s;&s;el loaded with provi&s;ions, or any other article; for the articles which are to become contraband, are as undefined as the occa&s;ion which makes them &s;uch? I again a&s;k, &s;ir, by what rule is this que&s;tion, &s;o important to our commerce, to be decided? You &s;ay, by the law of nations! but where is this law to be found? The writers on the law of nations, like the writers on every other law, differ from each other; but if the ca&s;es are preci&s;ely laid down, why not &s;tate them? Was the chief ju&s;tice of the United States le&s;s capable of doing this than the captain of a Providence privateer? The&s;e ca&s;es could either be defined with preci&s;ion, or they could not: in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they &s;hould have been &s;tated; in the la&s;t they &s;hould not have been affirmed by the &s;ignature of our envoy. But when an American ve&s;&s;el is brought into a Briti&s;h port, the maritime judge mu&s;t do what the chief ju&s;tice of the United States and Lord Grenville could not do; he mu&s;t determine, whether her cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of provi&s;ions and other articles, is or is not within the ca&s;e in which they may become contra|band. Now, let me a&s;k, &s;ir, whether, after what we have &s;een of their deci&s;ions, it was prudent to leave the whole commerce of the&s;e United States to their mercy, by giving them an un|limited power to judge, in ca&s;es of &s;o much intricacy, that you your&s;elf could not agree upon them? Do you reflect, &s;ir, that you have, by this very article, authorized them, even if, contrary to their u&s;ual practice, they conform to the law of nations, to condemn every ve&s;&s;el going to any port of France, or their colonies, with provi&s;ions, or returning from their i&s;lands to any port in Europe, loaded with the produce of tho&s;e i&s;lands, and that they derive this right from the very words of your treaty? The rule of the law of nations, as laid down by Vattel, and which is al&s;o a rule of the civil law, is thus: "that if he who can and &s;hould explain him&s;elf clearly and fully, neglects to do it, &s;o much the wor&s;e for him&s;elf; he &s;hall not be ad|mitted afterwards to make re&s;trictions, which he has not ex|pre&s;&s;ed." Now, the court of Great Britain has officially told us, that &s;he has a right by the law of nations, under the peculiar circum&s;tances of France, to interdict all trade in provi&s;ions with her or her i&s;lands; as al&s;o to prevent any part of the pro|duce of her colonies from being carried in neutral ve&s;&s;els to any port in Europe; the clamours excited by neutral powers, and the apprehen&s;ion of drawing upon her&s;elf new enemies, made her &s;u&s;pend <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the&s;e con&s;tructions: but with re&s;pect to <HI>us,</HI> as appears from Mr. Pinckney's and Mr. Hammond's
<PB N="226" REF="028389_0225_0FD8E91868FB6CB0">letters, &s;he &s;till keeps up the right, as &s;he &s;ays, under the law of nations. Her courts, conforming to this &s;entiment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> uniformly condemned a great number of cargoes, agreeably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the law of nations, &s;ay they, as expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e in&s;tructions.

Does it not relinqui&s;h our claim for every injury we have &s;uff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed under the very in&s;tructions which Mr. Jay was &s;ent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|mon&s;trate again&s;t? And this fully proves, what I before a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ed, that Mr. Jay's commi&s;&s;ioners could give no redre&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> citizens for the lo&s;s of their property, under tho&s;e in&s;tructions. That the Briti&s;h have viewed the treaty in this light, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the orders that they have lately renewed for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> our ve&s;&s;els going to France or Holland, dating their order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the time in which they might rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would have been ratified here.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations apply with equal force to the third mem|ber of this article: For as the Briti&s;h claimed a right to declare a whole nation at a time in a &s;tate of &s;iege, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that nation had beat them out of the field, to capture and con|demn all ve&s;&s;els going to any port of &s;uch nation, and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as this moment agree, that our ve&s;&s;els might be &s;o captured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> condemned, without defining, or in any part limiting the words, blockade and &s;iege, do we not tacitly agree to their con&s;truction of the term? Repugnant as this definition is to the e&s;tabli&s;hed and known laws of nations, it is very remarkable, that where the mo&s;t rigid con&s;truction of the laws of nations can be made to operate again&s;t us, in order to pre&s;erve them in full forts, and in contradiction of the &s;ettled practice of modern times, Mr. Jay has added to the&s;e laws, the weight of a national &s;tipu|lation again&s;t his con&s;tituents&mdash;but where the writers on natural law advance a principle, beneficial to us, Mr. Grenville's treaty cautiou&s;ly avoids putting it out of doubt, or giving it any addi|tional force. Thus Vattel declares, "That it is now received, that full faith and credit &s;hould be given to certificates and &s;ea
<PB N="227" REF="028389_0226_0FD8E919D164F508">letters, &amp;c. that the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip pre&s;ents, unle&s;s a fraud appears, or there be good rea&s;on of &s;u&s;picion."&mdash;Lib. III. chap. vii. (114)&mdash;and in every treaty of commerce, and navigation, that has been made, for upwards of one hundred years back, this principle is enlarged upon, and violences in boarding a &s;hip, to examine her papers, guarded again&s;t by fixing that the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">med &s;hip &s;hall remain at a di&s;tance, that the neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be boarded by two or three men only, that full faith &s;hall be given to papers, &amp;c. Yet not one word of this is to be found in Mr. Jay's treaty, except a mere vague agreement, that nei|ther party &s;hall injure the other in their per&s;ons or e&s;tate, and &s;hall make good all damages and be puni&s;hed for outrages, without defining what the&s;e outrages are, or fixing a line, which it &s;hould always be an outrage to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>That the Briti&s;h idea of outrage differed from ours, we know; for Mr. Jay him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fulle&s;t evidence of out|rages committed by captains of men of war and privateers, in plundering our ve&s;&s;els, and pre&s;&s;ing and ill-treating our &s;eamen; yet we hear of no officer that has lo&s;t his &s;hip or commi&s;&s;ion on this account: and as to private &s;uits, every man knows, that the expen&s;e and di&s;tance will prevent their being brought. With all the treaties hitherto entered into by the United States before him, as well as all other treaties made for a &s;eries of years pa&s;t, which are accurate on this point, could Mr. Jay be ignorant of the common practice of nations? Was he ignorant, that the abu&s;es we daily &s;uffered at &s;ea, in the boarding our &s;hips, with numerous bodies of armed men, in the contempt manife&s;ted for our papers, in breaking up the hatches, and endangering the &s;hip, were among the cau&s;es of complaint that the pre&s;ident &s;ent him to prefer? If he was not, why are not the&s;e evils guarded again&s;t by an expre&s;s &s;tipulation, that faith &s;hall be given to pa|pers, that no &s;hip &s;hall be &s;earched or detained, where her papers are fair, and &s;he does not refu&s;e to &s;how them! why are not privateers ordered to remain without gun &s;hot (as in our treaty with France, and the treaty of France with Britain, &amp;c.) while no more than two, or at mo&s;t three hands are admitted on board the neutral &s;hip? Why are vague and general terms &s;ub&s;tituted for the&s;e whole&s;ome provi&s;ions, unle&s;s it be with de&s;ign to &s;ub|ject our commerce to uncea&s;ing in&s;ults?</P>
<P>The &s;ame abandonment of our navigation runs through every commercial article. By the &s;eventeenth, the Briti&s;h are empow|ered (contrary to the principles of the armed neutrality, which have evidently changed the law of nations, by the general con|&s;ent of the great community of civilized nations, and to which Britain her&s;elf has in effect acceded, in this particular, by her
<PB N="228" REF="028389_0227_0FD8E91FCC15A4A8">late treaty with France) to take enemies' property from on board our ve&s;&s;els. One would have imagined, even if the law of na|tions had been clearly again&s;t us, that mere delicacy, with re&s;pect to the nations with whom we have treaties, by which we can protect the property of their enemies from them, would have induced us to refrain from a &s;tipulation, by which we volunta|rily &s;acrificed their property under the protection of our flag <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their enemies.</P>
<P>But that Mr. Jay did not think the law of nations on this point &s;ettled, appears from the la&s;t parts of the twelfth arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> after the war: but one would certainly have expected, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this article rendered every ve&s;&s;el we have, liable to &s;earch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> detention, that two points would at lea&s;t have been &s;ettled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&mdash; 1&s;t.

<P>IT may not be improper now to review our commerce, as it would &s;tand, were the treaty carried into effect. The Indian trade from Canada, alone, produced at public &s;ales in London, in 1784, &pound;. 230, 000 &s;terling. The duties thereon were in round numbers, &pound;. 17, 000. The tonnage of furs and peltry, about 1000 tons. The exports from Canada in furs, exceeded in 1785, that of the preceding year, about &pound;. 70, 000 &s;terling, and has, I believe, continued to increa&s;e; &s;o that this branch of trade may be fairly e&s;timated at near 100, 000 dollars yearly. As nine|tenths of the Indian nations, who carry on this trade (if the territories of the Hud&s;on Bay company are excepted) live within the boundaries of the &s;tates, as we enjoyed every advantage in the right to the po&s;ts and po&s;tages, the greate&s;t part of this va|luable trade mu&s;t have been ours, had not Mr. Jay thought proper to <HI>cede it,</HI> in effect, to the Briti&s;h, as I have before &s;tated. The Indian trade, in the &s;ourthern part of our territories, is principally in peltries, which are too bulky to be tran&s;ported in any other way than upon large rivers; the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi will be the out-let for a very great proportion of them. This commerce mu&s;t have been exclu&s;ively ours; for though, by the treaty of Paris, the Briti&s;h might navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; yet, as they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks, it became im|po&s;&s;ible for them to avail them&s;elves of this advantage; whereas the United States po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Indian country, in the vici|nity of that river, and the ea&s;t bank for many hundred miles, could, when they plea&s;ed, e&s;tabli&s;h factories, and monopolize that commerce; and in addition to this, carry on a very import|ant (though illicit) trade with the Spaniards, who own the oppo|&s;ite bank. This our mini&s;ter extraordinary was too munificent to allow us to avail our&s;elves of. He therefore provides, in the third article, "that all the ports and places, on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which&s;oever of the parties belonging, be freely re&s;orted to and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places, &amp;c." then comes a clau&s;e declaring, "that all goods and merchandizes, who&s;e importation into the United States is not wholly prohibited, may freely, for the pur|po&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame, in the manner afore&s;aid, by his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; and &s;uch goods and mer|chandizes &s;hall be &s;ubject to no other or higher duties than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els, in the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid &s;tates." I have already &s;hown, that the effect of this la&s;t provi&s;ion is to give Briti&s;h &s;hips a bounty proporti|oned
<PB N="230" REF="028389_0229_0FD8E92161C3F390">to the amount of the equalizing duty on the out and house voyage, taken together, to the prejudice of American ve&s;&s;els; which, with the perfect equality of rights, that they hold i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> common with our own citizens, and an addition of 46 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> extra tonnage, and light money, with which, as I have before &s;hown, our ve&s;&s;els will be charged, mu&s;t put this important commerce into the hands of the Briti&s;h.

<P>So that, after all, were our other branches of commerce le&s;t unfettered, we &s;hould be able to do without that of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, which only amounts to about one-eighth of the whole We&s;t India trade. And &s;uch is the dependence of tho&s;e i&s;lands upon us, that they mu&s;t either &s;tarve or be &s;upplied by us upon our terms. As this was too obvious to e&s;cape the attention of Lord Grenville, and our mini&s;ter, they have provided, 1. That we &s;hall impo&s;e no new duties on tonnage; that is, in other words, that, treat us as &s;he will, Britain &s;hall &s;till have the
<PB N="231" REF="028389_0230_0FD8E922EA9E2BE8">right to carry our produce to her i&s;lands in her own ve&s;&s;els, to the exclu&s;ion of ours. 2. That &s;he &s;hall al&s;o, if &s;he plea&s;es, prevent our carrying our produce to the French or Dutch i&s;lands, or their produce to Europe, at lea&s;t during a war, which has been, for one hundred years back, thirty years out of &s;eventy; &s;ince &s;he has nothing to do but to declare them in a &s;tate of &s;iege, or to allege that the articles are contraband, or that this is one of the ca&s;es in which they may become con|traband, though not generally &s;o; and &s;he will then be ju&s;tified, by the treaty, in carrying them into her own ports, where &s;ea|men may be pre&s;&s;ed on board their &s;hips of war, &s;educed to &s;wear that the cargo is enemies' property, and thus the whole be confi&s;cated; or if this great evil &s;hould be avoided, compel the owner to pay his own expen&s;es, and to take whatever the captor &s;hall deem a rea&s;onable profit, without any regard to the lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tains, in the breaking up his voyage, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In peace, France will, with ju&s;tice, avail her&s;elf of the ar|ticle which entitles her to put her trade upon the &s;ame footing as that of the mo&s;t favored nation, become her own carrier, and bani&s;h our ve&s;&s;els from her i&s;lands, as we have permitted the Briti&s;h to exclude us from theirs. Europe, perhaps, will be more favorable to us. But here again we have, by the equaliz|ing duty, and the extra-tonnage and light money, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to carry our commodities to Britain in our own ve&s;|&s;els; while we, at the &s;ame time, bind our&s;elves not to give &s;uch advantages to other nations as would open new markets for them. Britain then mu&s;t continue to navigate; for no other merchants mu&s;t monopolize our commerce; her officers mu&s;t &s;trut upon our exchanges with all the "dignity due to their commi&s;&s;ions;" her high commi&s;&s;ioned courts may drag us from one end of the continent to the other; mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h new rules of juri&s;prudence; and you, my unhappy fellow citizens, mu&s;t be content with the humble offices of hewers of wood and drawers of water, to the&s;e in&s;olent i&s;landers.</P>
<P>During the war, the conce&s;&s;ions relative to contraband amount to an ab&s;olute prohibition of any trade in naval &s;tores, timber, provi&s;ions, and any other article, which the Briti&s;h plea&s;e to call contraband, under exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, either with France or Holland.</P>
<P>The new treaty with the Algerines, will exclude you from Portugal, and render your voyages to Spain dangerous.</P>
<P>With the Baltic we have little commerce that will bear a war-freight, other than in the We&s;t India produce, which Bri|tain has &s;aid we &s;hall not carry to Europe; and Mr. Jay has acceded, expre&s;sly in the 12th, and impliedly in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th arti|cle,
<PB N="232" REF="028389_0231_0FD8E928F277CCC0">to this prohibition; &s;o that the commerce of the world (the Ea&s;t Indies and Great Britain alone excepted, and this latter, as I have &s;aid, can only be carried on, in peace at lea&s;t, in Briti&s;h bottoms is interdicted to us. During war, indeed, we may continue to carry, while the in&s;urance is le&s;s on our &s;hips than on tho&s;e of Britain, provided that our &s;eamen will choo&s;e to continue in a &s;ervice in which they are liable to re|peated in&s;ults; provided that the wants of the Briti&s;h mary &s;hall permit them to leave us any, of which there may be &s;ome doubts, as we ju&s;t learn that a &s;ingle frigate (&s;ince the treaty was advi&s;ed to be ratified) pre&s;&s;ed 35 of our &s;eamen upon our own coa&s;t, and another, the Hermione, no le&s;s than 70 in the We&s;t Indies: A &s;hip, too, we are informed, loaded with pro|vi&s;ion, has been carried into England, agreeably to an exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;tipulation in Mr. Jay's treaty, either under pretence that the provi&s;ion is contraband, or that it is enemies' property; and before any inve&s;tigation into the merits of the capture, every &s;eaman is taken out and put on board a frigate.</P>
<P>Our whole &s;tock of &s;eamen does not much exceed 12, 000.

He maintained our right to protect neutral property; he prote&s;ted with firmne&s;s again&s;t the ab&s;urd idea of naval &s;tores and provi&s;ions being con|traband; he &s;aw the wide difference between admitting a thing to be <HI>right,</HI> and yielding to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ities</HI> of the moment, which
<PB N="233" REF="028389_0232_0FD8E92EA55FE2E8">circum&s;tances might hereafter enable us to contend again&s;t with &s;ucce&s;s. Indeed it may be doubted whether the right given by treaty to take enemies' property out of our ve&s;&s;els, is not a "privilege or immunity" granted to the commerce and naviga|tion of Great Britain; in which ca&s;e, by the third article of our treaty with France, they have al&s;o a right to claim it; which e&s;tabli&s;hes an important di&s;tinction between <HI>&s;uffering</HI> this from nece&s;&s;ity, and granting it by treaty.</P>
<P>The ill effect which this treaty mu&s;t have upon our national character, exceeds all calculation. A young nation, like a young man, is bound to be particularly &s;olicitous on this head; nor can any thing be more repugnant to the intere&s;t and honor of the country, than the &s;hocking indifference that our mini&s;terial writers and their new&s;papers endeavour to inculcate on this head. Thus they &s;ay, "We are growing rich in &s;pite of all the&s;e injuries; let us mind our bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;let us &s;ubmit. We &s;hall hereafter be &s;trong, when we may blu&s;ter at our lei&s;ure." What &s;hould we think of the tutor that &s;hould inculcate on a young man the &s;ame maxims? "Suffer your&s;elf to be kicked and cuffed now, while you are young; let your &s;i&s;ter be ravi&s;h|ed, and your wife be debauched, by the letcher who permits you to get money. What though he in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;haring a part of it with you, and now and then lays his cudgel over your head? Submit now to &s;mile upon him; by and by you will be as &s;trong as he is, and then you may bully him in turn."&mdash; What, I &s;ay, &s;hould we think of &s;uch a tutor, but that he was a villain and a &s;coundrel, who was leading his pupil through the dread of pre&s;ent evil to deba&s;e his character, and to invite infinitely greater evils in future, than tho&s;e he feared to meet at pre&s;ent. What fir&s;t rai&s;ed the American character, and ac|quired for it the admiration of the world? Was it tame &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e injuries of Britain? Was it a &s;crupulous calcu|lation of what we might gain, or what we might lo&s;e, by the controver&s;y? No, my fellow citizens; it was a bold re&s;i&s;tance. It was an ardent pa&s;&s;ion for honor and freedom, that left all calculation of per&s;onal intere&s;ts out of &s;ight, and counted every thing was lo&s;t, if the&s;e were not won.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my former numbers, I endeavoured, 1&s;t, To &s;hew that the object of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as related to a com|pen&s;ation for the injuries received, and &s;ecurity again&s;t future aggre&s;&s;ion, was not accompli&s;hed. While I was yet writing, the renewal of them proved, beyond contradiction, that my re|marks were well founded, and that the Briti&s;h con&s;truction of the treaty was unhappily too &s;imilar to my own; &s;ince they on|ly waited to give &s;ufficient time for its ratification, to recom|mence, with added violence, their depredations on our trade, and their outrages again&s;t our citizen &s;eamen. I then examined the treaty in a mere commercial light, without indulging my|&s;elf in tho&s;e general reflections which aro&s;e naturally from the articles under con&s;ideration. I proceed now to con&s;ider it in a political point of view&mdash;Would to God, my fellow citizens, I could here find &s;ome &s;ource of con&s;olation, &s;ome ray of light, to irradiate the &s;ullen gloom!&mdash;But alas! every &s;tep we take, plunges us into thicker darkne&s;s. We might, perhaps, have &s;ubmitted to pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es; have &s;een our commerce given away without an equivalent; our navigation ruined; our &s;eamen (I blu&s;h with &s;hame and indignation, while I &s;ay it) our citizen &s;eamen delivered over to the in&s;olence of brutal tyrants, could our national honor have been pre&s;erved in future&mdash;could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ances, formed by intere&s;t and gratitude, have been left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> paired&mdash;could peace have been e&s;tabli&s;hed upon firm and honor|able terms&mdash;could the private rights of our citizens, the public ones of our government, have remained unviolated&mdash;but the indi&s;criminate ruin of all the&s;e is too much to be borne in &s;i|lence. Even the coward-advocates for peace, feel their &s;pirits ari&s;e at the unexampled indignities which this treaty impo&s;es. And for what? Are we nearer peace (if by peace is meant the &s;ecurity of our per&s;ons and property, from foreign depredations) than when Mr. Jay left this country? Is there a &s;ingle outrage which we &s;uffered before, which is not continued to this mo|ment? And yet the advocates for the treaty are continually ringing in our ears, the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, the horrors of war; and they have the effrontery to a&s;&s;ure us, that we enjoy the fir&s;t and have e&s;caped the la&s;t, merely (to borrow a mini&s;terial term) through the in&s;trumentality of the treaty. Does any body believe, that if we had continued to &s;uffer the Briti&s;h to plun|der our trade, to man their &s;hips with our &s;eamen, to po&s;&s;e&s;s our frontiers in quiet, the they would have declared war upon
<PB N="235" REF="028389_0234_0FD8E93613AEE508">us, at lea&s;t till they had conquered France? And can any man deny, that it would have been better to have pre&s;erved this dar|ling, but ba&s;e-born bantling, which excites our blu&s;hings while we fondle it, by mere &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than to legitimate the ba&s;tard, and compel our&s;elves for ever to maintain it upon the &s;ame di&s;|graceful terms, by marrying its lewd mother? In a political view, the treaty is bad; as it detaches us from engagements which our intere&s;t and honor equally invite us to maintain: as it &s;acrifices our friends to our enemies, and holds forth to the world, that tho&s;e nations who treat us wor&s;t, will &s;hare the greate&s;t portion of our attachment; and that, like fawning &s;paniels, we can be beaten into love and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, notwith|&s;tanding the corrupt maxims that were circulated under the &s;ignature of Pacificus, with a view to promote the league of de&s;pots again&s;t France.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the indecent attempts that were made about the &s;ame time, by &s;everal members of congre&s;s, to &s;hew that we owed her no affection, the principles of gratitude have &s;till maintained their ground in this country; and they have been &s;trengthened by the nece&s;&s;ity which every American felt, of &s;e|curing &s;ome ally again&s;t the de&s;ign which Britain almo&s;t open|ly avowed, of again reducing this country, when her means, &s;trengthened by the intere&s;t &s;he had in our councils and in our commercial cities, &s;hould afford her a pro&s;pect of attempting it with &s;ucce&s;s. It is &s;ingular to ob&s;erve the extreme &s;olicitude with which a party, among us, have endeavoured to detach the af|fections of this country from the only nation with whom its true intere&s;t would prompt it to form a clo&s;e and &s;trict alliance, not only becau&s;e its government is &s;imilar to our own, but be|cau&s;e its commerce is more advantageous to us than that of any other nation in the world; while its manufactures are &s;uch as can &s;upply the greate&s;t part of our wants, its demands for our produce are &s;o much larger than that of any other nation, that &s;he actually pays us a con&s;iderable proportion of that ba|lance in money which we are compelled to remit to Great Bri|tain on the lo&s;ing commerce which we carry on with her. It will be remembered here, that near two millions of our former exports to England, were con&s;umed in France, and as much more in other countries. It will be remembered, too, &s;he gives the highe&s;t encouragement to our navigation, while her in&s;ular rival u&s;es every means to depre&s;s it. Yet whenever any attempt has been made to encourage this commerce or &s;trength|en this alliance, the mo&s;t violent clamours have been excited by the Briti&s;h faction, aided by our own royali&s;ts, and the &s;lighte&s;t incidents have been &s;eized with avidity to render her
<PB N="236" REF="028389_0235_0FD8E93B8FEB7850">obnoxious. Thus the imprudent warmth of Mr. G&mdash;t called forth all the zeal of the party; mini&s;ters, chief ju&s;tices, &s;ena|tors, &amp;c. joined in full cry, to run down the French nation, under the appearance of regard for the honor of their own, while they were &s;o totally regardle&s;s of its intere&s;ts as to over|look the offers that he brought, of &s;uch commercial advantages as might have made us &s;ee with contempt, the narrow policy of the Briti&s;h government in excluding us from their i&s;lands, which the liberality of France mu&s;t have compelled her to open to us on our own terms.</P>
<P>And yet the&s;e very men have heard with the utmo&s;t indiffer|ence the in&s;ulting &s;peech of Lord Dorche&s;ter&mdash;the in&s;olent cor|re&s;pondence of H&mdash;d, which went, both in matter and man|ner, far beyond any thing written by G&mdash;t; and while they di&s;couraged a connection with France, founded upon mutual advantages, they meanly &s;upplicate Britain to treat with us upon her own terms, and contrive that this treaty &s;hould &s;erve the double purpo&s;e of connecting us with her, and detaching us from France. At the &s;ame time, they have the effrontery to a&s;&s;ert, that the treaty contains no article which can rea&s;onably give umbrage to France, or which in any way derogates from the friend&s;hip that &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two nations. I &s;hall proceed briefly to con&s;ider the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In the enumeration of contraband, Mr. Jay has included ar|ticles which are e&s;&s;ential to France, and which have not been con&s;idered, as far as I have been able to di&s;cover, as contraband in any treaty for 140 years pa&s;t. In admitting that provi&s;ions may be contraband in any ca&s;e (except when going to a place blockaded) Mr. Jay has al&s;o admitted, what no treaty ever be|fore did, though tyrants have &s;ometimes claimed a right to &s;top them. The United States had evidently no intere&s;t in either of the&s;e articles; of cour&s;e they could not be reciprocal, nor is any equivalent offered for them. France and Britain were at war: <HI>the&s;e articles were protected in going to the latter by our treaty with France; &s;o that in admitting them to be contraband, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nece&s;&s;arily confine the &s;ale of them to Great Britain, and exclude France from availing her&s;elf of our commerce in the&s;e articles, un|le&s;s at the utmo&s;t ri&s;que and expen&s;e;</HI> we make their genero&s;ity in excepting them from the li&s;t of contraband (if they really were &s;uch by the law of nations) afford the means of furni&s;hing them to their enemy: for if our treaty with France and Britain were &s;imilar in this re&s;pect, the ri&s;que and expen&s;e would have been equal in going to either country; and both would have obtained the&s;e commodities upon pretty much the &s;ame terms. It is evi|dent, then, that the&s;e articles could only have been diclated by
<PB N="237" REF="028389_0236_0FD8E93D0A468228">a &s;pirit ho&s;tile to France, and as &s;uch they are a direct breach of our neutrality.</P>
<P>Vattel, in enumerating the ca&s;es in which a neutral na|tion may carry on a commerce with the belligerent powers, has the&s;e words, which directly apply to the ca&s;e before us: "If they (the neutral nation) refu&s;e to &s;ell me any article, and take mea&s;ures to &s;upply my enemy with it in abundance, with a view to favor them, this partially is a breach of the neutrality." Whatever has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to the above article, ap|plies with equal force to the right that the treaty gives to Bri|tain to confi&s;cate the property of their enemy found on board our ve&s;&s;els, contrary to the modern law of nations, and their own admi&s;&s;ion of its principles in their treaty with France. But if any thing was wanting to &s;how the ho&s;tility of the&s;e articles, it could be found in the time we had pitched upon to enter into them, and that we had &s;tipulated for their continu|ance. 1&s;t, as I have &s;aid, France was actually at war. 2d, By the 12th article it is agreed that the&s;e provi&s;ions &s;hall continue in force during the pre&s;ent war, and for two years after, when the parties "will renew their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and endeavor to agree, whether in any, and what ca&s;es, neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall protect enemies' property; and in what ca&s;es provi&s;ions, and other arti|cles, not generally contraband, may become &s;uch."</P>
<P>From this it is evident, that the&s;e were que&s;tions of doubt in the minds of the contracting parties; they were &s;peculative que&s;tions, as capable of &s;olution in the pre&s;ent moment, as at any future period; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them could have no refer|ence to a war between powers with whom we were at peace; the declaring, therefore, that this doubt &s;hould be con&s;trued as unfavorably as po&s;&s;ible to France, and directly in favor of the Briti&s;h, even to the partial injury of our own commerce, with|out any <HI>apparent</HI> equivalent, and that, too, <HI>during the war,</HI> how long &s;oever it may la&s;t, is &s;o unequivocal a proof of ho&s;ti|lity, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take the intention of the con|tracting parties, which, reduced to plain language, is this: "the&s;e articles may be inconvenient in future; but as the exe|cution of them will be very injurious to France, who&s;e reduc|tion we both wi&s;h, we agree that his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hall have the full benefit of them, <HI>for the pre&s;ent;</HI> and when, by this operation, he &s;hall have reduced France to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, we will agree to modify them, &s;o as to render them conformable to our intere&s;ts." Injurious as the&s;e articles are to our commerce, the ba&s;ene&s;s and perfidy of them are &s;o much more &s;o to our national character, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e con&s;iderations is al|mo&s;t lo&s;t in our re&s;entment of the la&s;t. By the 24th article it
<PB N="238" REF="028389_0237_0FD8E943A5816120">is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that no power at war with Britain &s;hall &s;ell their prizes in our harbours.</P>
<P>Now by the law of nations, independent of treaties, any nation may carry her prize to a neutral port, and &s;ell it, Vat. 3 lib. ch. vii. 132; and accordingly, France has hitherto been permitted, without any expre&s;s &s;tipulation in her treaty, &s;o to do. To withdraw this right, <HI>now,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a war, though not expre&s;sly again&s;t the law of nations, has certainly a mo&s;t ungracious and unfriendly appearance; e&s;pecially as it is done without our being able to apologize for it by any intere&s;t that we can have, at lea&s;t during this war, in the &s;ti|pulation. As it was fore&s;een, at the time that the treaty was entered into, that Holland mu&s;t be conquered, and that &s;he would make an ally of France; the 25th article, which admits the Briti&s;h to bring their prizes into our ports, and forbids the armed ve&s;&s;els of any other nation (France excepted) to enter them, unle&s;s forced by &s;tre&s;s of weather, &amp;c. and which agrees that we &s;hall not in future, let any other nation &s;hare this favor, is certainly no evidence of a friendly attachment either to France or Holland; and yet the&s;e powers were our friends and allies, when Britain was our bittere&s;t foe. I forbear to remark upon the &s;tipulations we have made in favor of the navigation of Britain, as &s;peaking the &s;ame unfriendly language; &s;ince this is a le&s;s aggre&s;&s;ion and will undoubtedly be returned upon us by other nations; &s;o that the whole lo&s;s will ultimately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon our&s;elves, and the crime carry with it its own puni&s;hment. The liberality which France manife&s;ted to us in our di&s;tre&s;s&mdash; the &s;uccour &s;he afforded us&mdash;and the unexampled genero&s;ity &s;he manife&s;ted in taking no advantage of our &s;ituation, to im|po&s;e unju&s;t or hard conditions upon us, certainly &s;hould have rendered us cautions of favoring a nation, that has wantonly, and without the &s;lighte&s;t provocation, declared her&s;elf her ene|my, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t barbarous and unju&s;tifiable means to di&s;tre&s;s her. We &s;hould have &s;huddered at being parties to a compact, to &s;tarve 26 millions of our fellow creatures&mdash;at the thought of aiding Britain in her endeavours to repeat in Europe the horrid barbarities &s;he had committed in India. We &s;hould, even if we had no obligations to France, and been blind to our own intere&s;t, we &s;hould &s;till, for the &s;ake of humanity, have re&s;i&s;ted a treaty, which admitted, that the nece&s;&s;aries of life could, in any ca&s;e, be ju&s;tly withheld from a fami&s;hed nation. But if all the&s;e motives had no weight with us, we &s;hould have reflected on the forbearance, the delicate regard that France has &s;hown to our circum&s;tances, even in the mid&s;t of her di&s;|tre&s;s. By our treaty we have guaranteed her i&s;lands to her;
<PB N="239" REF="028389_0238_0FD8E9448BC99FB8">the&s;e i&s;lands are attacked; &s;he is entitled to the benefit of our guarantee. Yet &s;he has forborn to a&s;k it, as &s;he believed it incon&s;i&s;tent with our intere&s;t to go into the war. Can we ex|pect the &s;ame forbearance, after the predilection we have ma|nife&s;ted for her mo&s;t inveterate enemy? if not, are we prepared to choo&s;e between a breach of faith with her, the relinqui&s;h|ment of her guarantee of our independence, or a war with Britain?</P>

<P>AS every neutral nation may, without forfeiting that cha|racter, &s;uffer the belligerent powers to di&s;po&s;e of prizes in their harbours&mdash;as the United States will generally be at peace, while Britain is engaged in wars, 30 years out of 70, very con&s;iderable advantages would re&s;ult from this circum|&s;tance.&mdash;During a general European war, the commodities of all nations would be &s;old (as prize goods generally are) at a low rate, would &s;upply our own wants, and be tran&s;ported in our ve&s;&s;els to every part of the globe, and the demand for commo|dities and mechanics, nece&s;&s;ary to the fitting of ve&s;&s;els, would add to our wealth and &s;timulate our indu&s;try.&mdash;To relinqui&s;h the&s;e advantages without an equivalent, is certainly very unwi&s;e, particularly when it is con&s;idered, that our &s;ituation in the neighbourhood of the colonies of all the maritime powers, mu&s;t render the free admi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome and the exclu&s;ion of their enemies, extremely important to them. We have, there|fore, been very tenacious of this privilege, and denied it even to Holland, who may be con&s;idered as one of our earlie&s;t allies. Yet the 24th article of Mr. Jay's treaty expre&s;sly &s;tipulates, that no foreign nation, at war with Britain, &s;hall &s;ell her prizes in our harbours, excludes their armed ve&s;&s;els, and &s;tipulates that &s;imilar privileges &s;hall be granted to no other nations; and all this without any equivalent&mdash;For though the provi&s;ion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>mutual,</HI> yet the advantage is entirely on one &s;ide&mdash;1&s;t, Becau&s;e Britain being our only natural enemy (by natural enemy is un|der&s;tood one who&s;e intere&s;ts cla&s;h, either becau&s;e of the <HI>conti|guity of their territorries,</HI> or rivalry in their pur&s;uits) it is highly improbable that we &s;hall be engaged in any war in which &s;he is not a party again&s;t us. 2d, Becau&s;e our di&s;tance from Europe will prevent our being often engaged in tho&s;e controver&s;ies which convul&s;e that quarter of the globe. 3d, Becau&s;e there is no
<PB N="240" REF="028389_0239_0FD8E9463ABE6038">naval war in which Britain is not a party; if we &s;hould happen to be engaged on the &s;ame &s;ide with her, we &s;hould mutually u&s;e each others ports without a treaty; if we &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to her, the treaty will cea&s;e to operate; &s;o that in every view, we have made a very important conce&s;&s;ion in this particular, without having acquired any thing in return. The article is ex|tremely exceptionable in another point of view. The con&s;truc|tion is &s;o doubtful, that a &s;imilar article gave birth all the con|trover&s;y between our government and Mr. Genet. It would certainly have been prudent then to have varied the expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;teered clear of this ambiguity in treating with a nation who wre&s;ts every po&s;&s;ible doubt to her own advantage&mdash;and who finds chief ju&s;tices and &s;enators, and mini&s;ters extraordi|nary, and advocates, among our&s;elves, ready to &s;upport her con|&s;tructions, be they ever &s;o ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>By the 15th article, we are prohibited from impo&s;ing any &s;pecific duty on Briti&s;h articles, which we do not extend to all other nations, from increa&s;ing our tonnage duty or impo&s;ing any greater charge on the importation of goods in Briti&s;h bot|toms than <HI>now</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. I have already &s;hown the mi&s;chievous effect of this article upon our <HI>navigation.</HI> I will now con&s;ider it, as it regards our political relation with other nations.&mdash; Treaties are bargains, in which &s;omething is given in return for &s;ome other received. Tho&s;e, then, that put it out of their power to <HI>give,</HI> cannot hope to <HI>receive.</HI> Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, we &s;hould find it convenient, in order to procure a market for our fi&s;h and oil, to bargain with France for their free admi&s;&s;ion into her ports, and promi&s;e in return to receive her manufac|tures of &s;ilk at a le&s;s duty than we impo&s;e upon the &s;ame arti|cles brought from el&s;ewhere. This is the policy of Britain with re&s;pect to Portugal, who&s;e wines &s;he favors in preference to tho&s;e of other nations, in return for advantages &s;he derives from her commerce.&mdash;This article puts &s;uch a bargain entirely out of our power; yet &s;uffers Britain to continue her re&s;tric|tions upon a variety of our commodities. While it remains in force, no treaty whatever in favor of our manufactures, navi|gation, or commerce, can be entered into with other nations; thus, notwith&s;tanding we have not any equivalent from Britain, in return for this article, any relaxation of her oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;|tem of navigation, we bind our hands with re&s;pect to every other nation&mdash;and while &s;he clo&s;es one door upon us, promi&s;es to leave our commerce and navigation impri&s;oned without mak|ing the &s;malle&s;t effort to open another.</P>
<P>The tenth article of the treaty partakes of the evils of the above, in the want of reciprocity, and in depriving us of the
<PB N="241" REF="028389_0240_0FD8E94A6D4727F0">means of doing our&s;elves ju&s;tice, without recurring to arms, when the laws of nations with re&s;pect to us are violated. By this article, neither the debts due to individuals, nor money in the funds, are to be <HI>&s;eque&s;tered</HI> or confi&s;cated. Fir&s;t, this is not mutual; becau&s;e it is well known that few Americans tru&s;t their money in Briti&s;h funds, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our own. And a balance of about ten millions (exclu&s;ive of &s;tock) is due from our citizens, on the general average, to the &s;ubjects Britain. By the law of nations, this property may be <HI>&s;eque&s;|tered;</HI> though, in general, it has been <HI>the practice</HI> of late, &s;ince the commercial connections of nations have multiplied, not to <HI>forfeit it,</HI> and that, principally, becau&s;e the balances being mu|tually due, little advantage would accrue to the nation.</P>
<P>As to the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, it never has been made a que&s;tion; the rule of nations is, "that the property, either private or public, of an enemy, may be taken," and I believe it would be difficult to &s;how, that it was more ju&s;t to rob the merchant of his goods at &s;ea, becau&s;e his &s;overeign was at war, than to forfeit his debts; both being equally the property of an enemy, both tending equally to di&s;tre&s;s the individual, and neither being a violation of a private contract, becau&s;e the nation who makes the forfeiture is no party to &s;uch contract. If the rights of humanity are con&s;idered, a capture at &s;ea is a much greater breach of them, &s;ince it is frequently attended with the lo&s;s of life, and always with the lo&s;s of liberty. The &s;tigma, therefore, that our mini&s;ter was plea&s;ed to introduce into the treaty on this &s;ubject, could only have been intended as an illiberal reflection upon tho&s;e virtuous men in our national legi&s;lature, who conceived this a proper fund, out of which to compen&s;ate the lo&s;&s;es committed by the unju&s;t violences of Bri|tain. That there are ca&s;es in which the &s;eque&s;tering and even the forfeiture of debts would be proper, can hardly be di&s;puted; as, for in&s;tance, where it might prevent the aggre&s;&s;or from going into a war, by the fear of lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;take in the hands of his enemy. Where a war has actually broke out, and the &s;um due is &s;o great as to di&s;able the debtor nation from carrying it on with effect, if &s;he &s;uffered &s;o large a balance to be remitted to her enemy; or where the enemy nation relies on that balance, to &s;upport her military operations; &s;urely it will not be di&s;puted, that in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, in which the &s;afety of the nation &s;o evidently required it, it would be highly imprudent and unju&s;t to the people, to &s;uffer &s;uch debts to be paid. So likewi&s;e, where the creditor nation had manife&s;ted the mo&s;t ho&s;tile intentions, had &s;timulated barbarians to lead your people into captivity&mdash;had employed &s;avages under their
<PB N="242" REF="028389_0241_0FD8E94CD1821228">influence, to break up your frontiers, and to murder your wives and children&mdash;had, without any pretence from ju&s;tice, or the laws of nations, compelled your people to fight under their banners again&s;t your allies&mdash;and had given &s;uch interruptions to your commerce, as to di&s;tre&s;s and ruin your merchants&mdash; &s;urely it would be but a &s;light retaliation for the&s;e wrongs, to &s;ay to &s;uch nation, "we will detain in our hands the balance due to you, till you make ample compen&s;ation for the injury you have done us, and if you do not us us ju&s;tice, we will ap|ply the money our&s;elves." Our &s;ituation is very peculiar; the balance we owe to Britain, including &s;tock in the funds, banks, &amp;c. cannot be le&s;s than twenty-five millions of dollars, a much greater &s;um than the whole circulating &s;pecie of the United States. If it &s;hould be known in Britain, that a war with us was intended, as much as po&s;&s;ible of this capital would in&s;tant|ly be withdrawn from America; the con&s;equence would be, if the government &s;hould not interpo&s;e to prevent the evil, and retain the money, that in the moment that we wanted credit mo&s;t, at the entrance into a war, the nation would be bank|rupt; the banks and merchants to whom it would look for &s;up|plies, would be ruined and unable to afford them aid, while the credit of Britain, &s;upported by our payments, would enable them to effect our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Again, by the laws of civilized nations, unnece&s;&s;ary and wanton de&s;truction is prohibited; but the &s;eaport towns of America are extremely expo&s;ed. Should Britain, in a war with us, or even without war, under &s;ome trifling pretence, think proper to burn our towns, and by this means ruin the mer|chants that were indebted to them, would it not be ju&s;t in the government, to retaliate upon their merchants, by retaining the&s;e debts, until compen&s;ation was made, or even to make compen&s;ation them&s;elves out of this money? and where is the difference between making it an&s;wer one breach of the law of nations more than another? Why is it le&s;s proper to compen&s;ate the &s;eamen who have lo&s;t their liberty, the family who have lo&s;t a father or a &s;on, or a merchant who has lo&s;t his property, by the mo&s;t <HI>direct</HI> violence; than the citizen who&s;e wharf and &s;tore are wantonly burned? The truth is, that this debt in our hands had a very con&s;iderable influence upon the politics of Britain, with re&s;pect to us. There is a great portion of the monied men, who generally go with admini&s;tration, that would be &s;en&s;ibly affected by the forfeiture, and who are tremblingly alive to every operation of our government with re&s;pect to it; while we can work upon their fears, they will always be the advocates for peace with us; remove their apprehen&s;ions, and
<PB N="243" REF="028389_0242_0FD8E94EABC6CD68">they will go with admini&s;tration. There is great rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the propo&s;itions in congre&s;s to &s;eque&s;ter this debt, produced the relaxations in their predatory &s;y&s;tem that took place immediately after. Now, that Mr. Jay has convinced them that they have nothing to fear in future, they have renewed them with equal violence. Can any thing be a better comment|ary upon the treaty, than the pre&s;ent conduct of their marine? I know that much will be &s;aid in reply to this, on the &s;anctity of public credit, &amp;c. which may indeed prove what I &s;hall readily admit, that &s;o violent a remedy &s;hould not be recurred to on &s;light occa&s;ions; but nothing can be &s;aid to prove, that <HI>no occa&s;ion</HI> will ju&s;tify &s;uch recurrence, or to convince a free people, that their <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> are not the proper judges of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;trict law of nations, as laid down both by Vattel and Binher&s;t, is, that &s;uch debts may be forfeited; the USUAL practice is, to &s;tay the payment, but, not forfeit the debts; and the <HI>con&s;tant</HI> practice is, to pay the proceeds of real property, held by the &s;ubject of an enemy; into the public trea&s;ury, and yet this ca&s;e is much &s;tronger than the ca&s;e of debts; becau&s;e the holder of real property derives his title from the &s;tate it&s;elf; but it is deemed ab&s;urd to let property pa&s;s from a &s;tate (when at war) to its rival, in order to feed the fire that is to con&s;ume them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, if a contract were made, during peace, by the merchants of one nation to deliver arms and ammunition to the merchants of another, and a war was to break out, or even to be rendered probable between the&s;e nations, would it be wrong to &s;top the delivery of tho&s;e arms, though they &s;hould have been actually paid for? And is money le&s;s a nece&s;&s;ary of war, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, than arms? Should we be le&s;s weaken|ed by paying all the current &s;pecie of the country, &s;topping our banks, and &s;inking the public funds, than by &s;ending away a few tons of powder, or &s;ome hundred &s;tand of arms? But if the law of nations on this &s;ubject is clear, to what purpo&s;e en|ter into new &s;tipulations to give it a more binding force? A breach of the law of nations by an enemy, often renders that right which would otherwi&s;e have been wrong; <HI>retaliation</HI> is one of the laws of nations; but that law, &s;o frequently e&s;&s;enti|al to the &s;upport of our rights, is, by this article, entirely taken away, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as relates to this object. And yet, this is the ground on which we might retaliate with the greate&s;t pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But in any event, as we will always be the debtor nation, to what purpo&s;e are our hands bound? What equivalent do we receive for this important conce&s;&s;ion? The
<PB N="244" REF="028389_0243_0FD8E954D0C6FBA0">having it in our power to hold this up in terrorem, if we never made any other u&s;e of it, might an&s;wer important purpo&s;es. Who can &s;ay, that it may not be at &s;ometimes proper to di&s;|courage the Briti&s;h from engro&s;&s;ing too great a &s;hare in our &s;tocks and banks, or even giving too great a credit to our mer|chants? we already &s;ee the influence they have acquired over the <HI>politics</HI> of the country by means of the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fact is, that this article is dictated by the &s;ame princi|ple that pervades &s;o many others in the treaty; our trade and navigation are &s;urrendered to the Briti&s;h. Colonies of their mer|chants and factors are to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the north and on the we&s;t, on the &s;ea coa&s;t and on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi Our banks are to be placed in their hands, and that the thraldom of the coun|try may be complete, every encouragement is to be held out to their brethren in England, to extend their credit and fetter the country by the exce&s;s of their debt; at the &s;ame time, all the re&s;ources of the country are to be &s;urrendered to them, even out la&s;t farthing is to be drawn away, whenever it may be found nece&s;&s;ary to bring us back to our former &s;tate of dependence upon their &s;overeign. Would it not have been wi&s;er in Ameri|ca, to have &s;ubmitted to the &s;tamp act, with the advantages we enjoyed under the Briti&s;h government, than by yielding to this treaty, to render our&s;elves equally dependant, without enjoying the rights of &s;ubjects? All that &s;he would have drawn away in taxes, would not have equalled our pre&s;ent debt; our &s;eamen would not have been treated &s;o har&s;hly as they now are; our commerce would have been le&s;s deranged; and the di&s;grace of &s;lavery would have been le&s;s degrading, if we never had been <HI>free.</HI></P>

<P>THE few advocates that the treaty has yet met with, pre|tend to be zealou&s;ly attached to the con&s;titution of the United States; and endeavour to per&s;uade weak minds that the oppo&s;ition to it has originated in oppo&s;ition to the federal government, and in party views and party principles; yet un|fortunately for them, it has &s;o happened, that the &s;tates in which there is lea&s;t of party &s;pirit, manife&s;t mo&s;t warmth and mo&s;t unanimity in their oppo&s;ition. Thus South Carolina, and the city of Charle&s;ton particularly, Maryland, Delaware, Jer&s;ey, and New-Hamp&s;hire, have contained no antifederal party; yet
<PB N="245" REF="028389_0244_0FD8E9581AC09A30">they are more decided in their di&s;approbation of the treaty, than New York, Philadelphia, or Bo&s;ton, where &s;uch parties have been &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t. Is it not evident, then, that the &s;up|port the treaty has received, has originated in party principles, aided by the Briti&s;h intere&s;t; while the principal oppo&s;ition, originating with men who are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their attach|ment to the federal government, mu&s;t be attributed to pure and di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, at who&s;e &s;hrine they have &s;acrificed their predilection for men and mea&s;ures, where that predilecti|on cla&s;hed with their committee's reports?</P>
<P>It is remarkable, too, that if we look over the li&s;t of names of the per&s;ons who were members of congre&s;s in 1775 and 1776, and &s;ubtract from them per&s;ons immediately connected with the government, and who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have influ|enced the treaty, we &s;hall find them decided in their oppo&s;ition to it, even though many of them have for years pa&s;t retired from politics, and in no &s;ort interfered in the parties of the day.</P>
<P>In Carolina, both the Rutledges and Gad&s;den.&mdash;In Virginia, Jeffer&s;on, Madi&s;on, the grave and moderate Chancellor Wythe, who him&s;elf pre&s;ided at the meeting that addre&s;&s;ed the pre&s;i|dent on the &s;ubject of his proclamation, which was then deem|ed a te&s;t of violent federali&s;m, together with every di&s;tingui&s;h|ed citizen of that important &s;tate, not holding an office.&mdash;In Delaware, the celebrated John Dickin&s;on, the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania farmer,</HI> who&s;e enlightened pen was among the fir&s;t, and cer|tainly the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, that has been mar&s;halled on the &s;ide of American freedom.&mdash;In Penn&s;ylvania, Governor Mifflin, Chief Ju&s;tice M'Kean.&mdash;In New Jer&s;ey I believe none of the old members of congre&s;s are now living; but the uniform &s;enti|ment of that federal and patriotic &s;tate, may be urged as a proof of what their &s;entiments would have been, had they lived to blu&s;h at this blot on their country's honor.&mdash;In New York, Floyd and Living&s;ton are known to be decidedly oppo&s;ed to the treaty. What are tho&s;e of Schuyler and Duane, Lewis and Morris, the only &s;urviving members, Jay excepted, I know not. That Mr. Jay, though he has made the treaty, does not approve of its principles (unle&s;s, in leed, Mr. Jay the negocia|tor, is a different man from Mr. Jay the writer of an addre&s;s to the citizens of New York on the &s;ubject of the federal go|vernment) is obvious; for that addre&s;s, if examined, will be found to urge our union as a mean to regulate our commerce, or to compel foreign nations to relax their impo&s;itions, and even to open their i&s;lands to us; I &s;peak from memory, not having the addre&s;s before me. Now, if this &s;entiment was ju&s;t then, when our numbers, wealth, and re&s;ources, were much
<PB N="246" REF="028389_0245_0FD8E9598ED228B0">le&s;s than at pre&s;ent; and when Britain was at peace, and one hundred millions le&s;s in debt than at this day, Mr. Jay mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;approve now of a treaty, which puts it out of our power to regulate our own commerce; which confirms all the re&s;trictions that we then con&s;idered as ho&s;tile to our trade and navigation, and an infinite number of new ones, that did not then exi&s;t: which, in&s;tead of opening their i&s;lands, clo&s;es them upon us, unle&s;s we will con&s;ent to purcha&s;e an in&s;ignificant right to vi&s;it them in <HI>boats,</HI> by a di&s;graceful &s;urrender of an im|portant part of our commerce. So that we may, on the fulle&s;t proof, deduced from his unbia&s;&s;ed declaration, under his own hand, number Mr. Jay among tho&s;e who in &s;entiment di&s;ap|prove of the treaty. The opinions of the then members of Connecticut, if any of them &s;urvive, or tho&s;e of Mr. Samuel Adams or of Mr. Paine (who, however, holds an office) I am unacquainted with. Neither of the gentlemen who then held a place in congre&s;s, from Rhode I&s;land, are now living. The on|ly &s;urviving member of that day from New Hamp&s;hire (Mr. Langdon) has given his mo&s;t decided oppo&s;ition to the treaty; though in &s;o doing, he left his friends in the &s;enate in whom he had mo&s;t confidence, and the party with which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> generally voted. As far as I have yet learned, not <HI>one native American,</HI> who in tho&s;e trying times directed the councils of America, and is or has been unconnected with the pre&s;ent ad|mini&s;tration, has manife&s;ted a &s;entiment favorable to this di&s;|graceful treaty. How little credit then mu&s;t tho&s;e advocates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it de&s;erve, who endeavour to prop their mi&s;erable edifice, by repre&s;enting its opponents as a factious few, and men ignorant of the great intere&s;ts of their country?</P>
<P>To this <HI>po&s;itive</HI> evidence of the &s;en&s;e of Americans, upon this &s;ubject, may be added very important negative te&s;timony, deduced from the character of its mo&s;t &s;tedfa&s;t &s;upporters. Without having a reference to men in office (who&s;e views it may be improper to explain) we find every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, and every man who has been uniformly ho&s;tile to American inde|pendence, on the &s;ide of the treaty. That a few others, who wi&s;h well to their country, have acquie&s;eed in the mea&s;ure, I am ready to acknowledge; attachment to party, per&s;onal friend&s;hip, a con&s;idence in &s;ome on whom they are u&s;ed to re|po&s;e their political &s;entiments, family connection, will, in eve|ry que&s;tion, have more or le&s;s influence. But as all the&s;e pro|fe&s;s them&s;elves decided friends to the con&s;titution of the United States, I am per&s;uaded that they will change their &s;entiments when they are convinced of the <HI>un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itutionality</HI> of the treaty, of its being at war with every check, with every provi&s;ion,
<PB N="247" REF="028389_0246_0FD8E95B0AD53D38">by which it guards again&s;t the intru&s;ion of one branch upon the rights of another, and which, if &s;uffered, would terminate in de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>It will be found that no ratification by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate can carry this treaty into effect, without the concurrence of congre&s;s; nor, in &s;ome points, even with &s;uch concurrence, without the aid of the &s;tate legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>No rule is better e&s;tabli&s;hed, than, that in con&s;truing any legal in&s;trument, the whole mu&s;t be taken together; that if two different parts appear to militate again&s;t each other, &s;uch a con&s;truction, if po&s;&s;ible, is to be given them, as to render each &s;en&s;ible without rejecting either; for it is ab&s;urd to &s;up|po&s;e, that contradictions can be intended, or that unmeaning provi&s;ions would be purpo&s;ely in&s;erted. The con&s;titution of the United States has de&s;ined the powers of its different branches&mdash;to the executive, it has given a power to make treaties; to the judiciary, a right to judge of <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> ari&s;ing under &s;uch treaties; to congre&s;s, a right to regulate commerce with fo|reign nations and with the Indians, to define piracy, to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h offices,</HI> to &s;ettle the &s;alary of officers, and to rai&s;e and appro|priate money. The&s;e powers are perfectly di&s;tinct from each other, and may be all exerci&s;ed without interference&mdash;Thus the pre&s;ident and &s;enate may make treaties of peace, of alli|ance, of neutrality, &amp;c. but not &s;uch treaties as &s;hall abridge the rights, either of congre&s;s or of the judiciary, as to tho&s;e matters that are expre&s;sly re&s;erved to them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, congre&s;s &s;hall not interfere, in any trea|ties, as to tho&s;e objects which are not expre&s;sly re&s;erved to them; nor can they take from the judiciary the right to deter|mine all que&s;tions ari&s;ing on treaties, while &s;uch treaties re|main in force. On any other con&s;truction, one branch of the con&s;titution might po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf of all the powers re&s;erved to the others. Thus, if the power to make treaties includes a right to regulate commerce, to rai&s;e money, to declare war, to appoint officers and &s;ettle their &s;alaries, to e&s;tabli&s;h new courts and new rules of juri&s;prudence, to place in other hands, rights re&s;erved to the judiciary of the United States, to natu|ralize foreigners, to define and puni&s;h piracy and other offences again&s;t the United States, then the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, by combining with a foreign nation, can inve&s;t them&s;elves with all power, and congre&s;s and the judiciary mu&s;t become u&s;ele&s;s. If, for in&s;tance, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate can agree that three Briti&s;h and two Americans, or vice ver&s;a, may draw money at their di&s;cretion out of the public trea&s;ury, they mu&s;t, as incident to the power, have a right to appropriate public mo|ney,
<PB N="248" REF="028389_0247_0FD8E963A5F099C8">to controul appropriations already made, and to fill the trea&s;ury, if empty, by taxes. For it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that they have a right to give away public money, and yet that they have no money to give: a clear power always &s;uppo&s;es every thing nece&s;&s;ary to effectuate &s;uch power. If it is &s;aid, that they may &s;tipulate for the payment of money; but that congre&s;s may or may not, at their di&s;cretion, rai&s;e and appro|priate it to the u&s;e de&s;ignated by &s;uch &s;tipulation, then it will follow, that no treaty, which compri&s;es powers re&s;erved to congre&s;s, can be binding, until they give it their &s;anction: in &s;uch ca&s;e, any ratification by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, until they obtain the a&s;&s;ent of congre&s;s, mu&s;t be nugatory; and as it may, al&s;o, involve us in di&s;agreeable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with foreign powers, it mu&s;t be intended that they have no right to &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s and perhaps dangerous ratifications. If, indeed, every article made a di&s;tinct treaty (which I believe will hardly be contended) then they might, without &s;uch a&s;&s;ent, ratify the&s;e articles which did not interfere with the rights of congre&s;s, but as to all others they have no power. If, on the other hand, after a treaty is entered into, congre&s;s have no di&s;cretion, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enact laws to carry it into effect, all the pow|ers of government would be re&s;olvable into the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, and congre&s;s are a mere in&s;trument in their hands. And to the millions Mr. Jay has already given away by the treaty, might be added, all the wealth of the United States. A treaty of commerce might tax even our exports in the face of the con&s;titution; for &s;urely if &s;uch a treaty can prohibit the exportation of certain commodities as the 12th article does, it might tax them, ina&s;much as a prohibition involves greater power than taxation.</P>
<P>If they can create new crimes by treaty, and define the pu|ni&s;hment of them, the whole criminal code is &s;ubjected to the will of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. If they can exempt a favorite nation from the operation of exi&s;ting laws, they may impo&s;e burdens upon others: for to repeal a law is not le&s;s a legi&s;lative act than to make one. Their being able to effectuate this by treaty only, and not in ordinary ca&s;es, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, adds to the evil, and the danger the con&s;titution would incur by this con&s;truction; &s;ince it would thereby enable them to call in a foreign power, to aid in their u&s;urpations; and as &s;uch creaties might be kept &s;ecret till every nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure was taken to enforce them, all re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion would be vain; nor could the pre&s;ident or &s;enate incur any ri&s;k by any attempt to &s;eize all powers under pretence of a treaty, if we once admit that a right to make treaties includes every other
<PB N="249" REF="028389_0248_0FD8E964CFD52578">power of government. There are &s;o many ab&s;urdities involved in the&s;e po&s;itions, that it becomes our duty to &s;hew that they do not exi&s;t in the con&s;titution, but are to be avoided by an ea&s;y and natural con&s;truction. Fir&s;t, it appears from the pow|ers given to congre&s;s, that they are in every in&s;tance to retain their free agency, and cannot be compelled by any other branch of the government to do any act&mdash;the words of the con&s;titution are, "congre&s;s &s;hall have power;" then follows the enumeration of their powers. They cannot then be forced to rai&s;e money in con&s;equence of any treaty, nor to do any other act, derogatory to the rights ve&s;ted in them. The laws they have pa&s;&s;ed, or &s;hall pa&s;s, in pur&s;uance of &s;uch powers, remain in full force, notwith&s;tanding any treaty the executive may form, derogatory to them; nor is there a word in the con&s;titution that &s;ets trea|ties above the laws of the United States; both together with the con&s;titution it&s;elf, are called &s;upreme laws, as contra-di&s;|tingui&s;hed to the laws of particular &s;tates only. The words in article VI. of the con&s;titution are, "This con&s;titution and the laws of the United States, which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land. And the judges in every &s;tate, &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding." It will certainly not be pretend|ed, that treaties are &s;uperior to the con&s;titution, under which they are made; on the contrary, as it is held that laws them|&s;elves have no force in oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution; &s;o it may be inferred from the order in which they are placed, as well as the rea&s;on of the thing, that treaties are inferior in force to laws.&mdash;Were it otherwi&s;e, when a treaty was once ratified, however it might be abu&s;ed, how de&s;tructive &s;oever it might be to the United States in its operation, we never could get rid of it; becau&s;e the judges, who are &s;worn to ob&s;erve the laws, would enforce it. And yet there are many ca&s;es, enumerated by the writers on the law of nations, in which a treaty may be ju&s;tifiably broken; and numberle&s;s rea&s;ons may exi&s;t with the &s;overeign of the country for violating it.</P>
<P>The only true and &s;ound con&s;truction of the con&s;titution is, that treaties are to have the force of laws; but, like all other laws, are &s;ubject to the will of the &s;overeign, that is, to con|gre&s;s; that the power of the pre&s;ident in making treaties, can only extend to ca&s;es that are <HI>not re&s;erved</HI> by the con&s;titution to congre&s;s; that whenever he negociates as to other objects, his negociations mu&s;t be authorized by a prior or &s;ub&s;equent law. Though this con&s;truction may involve &s;ome <HI>inconveniencies,</HI> yet
<PB N="250" REF="028389_0249_0FD8E9665331F4A8">it avoids <HI>ab&s;urdities.</HI> It gives force to every part of the con&s;titu|tion; it rejects no provi&s;ions in it, nor makes one part cla&s;h with another. It is con&s;i&s;tent with the practice in mixed go|vernments&mdash;thus, in Britain, the king may make treaties; but, when money is nece&s;&s;ary to carry them into effect, when they cla&s;h with the laws of the nation, a legi&s;lative provi&s;ion is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give them effect. And the parliament can at any time make laws in the face of a treaty; though, until &s;uch laws are made, the treaty is re&s;pected by the courts. Whatever has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to the rights of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, as oppo&s;ed to the exclu&s;ive rights of congre&s;s, applies with equal force to the rights of &s;tates; where the treaty is made relative to objects not &s;urrendered by them, the treaty that is binding upon them, mu&s;t be con&s;titutionally made, and con&s;i&s;t with the powers yielded to the federal government; otherwi&s;e the pre&s;ident might barter away the independence of individual &s;tates, which makes a nece&s;&s;ary part of the con&s;titution of the United States, and which is expre&s;sly guaranteed.</P>
<P>Now, let us apply the&s;e principles to the treaty&mdash;And to be|gin with the &s;ixth article. By this article commi&s;&s;ioners are to be appointed, two by the Briti&s;h king, two by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate; the fifth by the other four, or by lot. The&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioners are to &s;it <HI>as a court,</HI> to determine que&s;tions relative to the demands of the Briti&s;h merchants&mdash;They are to examine the parties on oath, to fix their <HI>own</HI> rules of evidence, and to decide <HI>not by the laws of the country,</HI> but according to their ideas of j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tice and equity. Their deci&s;ion is to be both <HI>arbi|trary and final.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t enquiry is into the <HI>right</HI> of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to appoint the commi&s;&s;ioners contemplated by this article. If they have any &s;uch right, it mu&s;t be derived from the con&s;titu|tion; for it will not be pretended that the king of Great Britain can give them new rights, or that they can enlarge their own power, by entering into a treaty with a foreign nation. Yet the only powers the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have, relative to this object, are, to "appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e appointments are not herein pro|vided for, <HI>and which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI>" Here the officers that the executive may appoint, are <HI>enumerated;</HI> and &s;o careful is the con&s;titution to prevent their u&s;ing any impro|per di&s;cretion, in the creation of unnece&s;&s;ary officers, that it expre&s;sly limits the powers of appointment as to all others, <HI>to &s;uch as &s;hall be e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;hed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve.</HI> The only que&s;tion, then, is, whether the commi&s;&s;ioners contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> by the treaty are in
<PB N="251" REF="028389_0250_0FD8E96CDDAF0B78">the cla&s;s of enumerated officers&mdash;They are not amba&s;&s;adors, con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, nor are they <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI> To &s;ay that the treaty is a law, and that therefore all officers e&s;tabli&s;hed by treaty, are e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, would only be to argue in a circle, and to go back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the point we &s;tarted from. It would be to a&s;&s;ert, that every thing might be done by treaty, which could be done by law; and, as I have before &s;aid, that under the form of a treaty, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate might a&s;&s;ume all powers, legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary. The que&s;tion then is, whether they are the <HI>public mini&s;ters</HI> con|templated by the con&s;titution? It is evident, from the words <HI>public mini&s;ters,</HI> following the word <HI>amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> and preceding the word <HI>con&s;uls,</HI> that diplomatic mini&s;ters only could be in|tended; &s;ince it takes the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t of the&s;e, and u&s;es general words to "other public mini&s;ters," to de&s;ignate the various intermediate grades. But &s;urely, commi&s;&s;ioners, who are to hold their &s;e&s;&s;ions in our own country, and to determine que&s;tions of private juri&s;prudence, cannot in this &s;en&s;e be de|nominated public mini&s;ters; as well might we call the auditor a public mini&s;ter, becau&s;e he &s;ettles the accounts of &s;trangers and citizens; or the attorney general, who&s;e duty it is to &s;ee that the &s;ubjects of foreign princes are not maltreated. In one &s;en&s;e, indeed, not only they, but every other officer of the &s;tate, is a public mini&s;ter; but that this is not the &s;en&s;e of the con&s;titu|tion, is evident from its enumerating certain public officers, as, for in&s;tance, judges of the &s;upreme court (who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is exten|&s;ive &s;en&s;e, are al&s;o <HI>public mini&s;ters</HI>) and from its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the right of appointment, as to all others; "to &s;uch as &s;hall be <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by law</HI>" it is evident, that the con&s;titution mu&s;t have a&s;&s;ixed &s;ome &s;pecific idea to the words "other public mini&s;ters." What that idea was, appears clearly from the context; and it would be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e, to extend it to a &s;pecies of officers that never exi&s;ted either in this, nor, as I believe, in any other country in the world. In the third &s;ection, the &s;ame idea is &s;till pur&s;ued&mdash;"He &s;hall receive amba&s;&s;adors and other public mi|ni&s;ters."</P>
<P>The con&s;titution al&s;o pre&s;erves a right to ve&s;t the appoint|ment of officers (other than tho&s;e enumerated) either in the pre&s;ident <HI>alone,</HI> the <HI>courts of law,</HI> or the <HI>heads of departments.</HI> By what authority, then, can Mr. Jay and Lord Grenville, or the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, over-rule the con&s;titution, and a&s;&s;ume a power to controul the rights of congre&s;s, to create the of|fice, and to place it in &s;uch hands as they think proper, under the above limitations? But &s;uch are the powers of the&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioners, as even congre&s;s it&s;elf cannot authorize, without

"In all ca&s;es of admiralty and maritime juri&s;diction, to controver&s;ies to which the <HI>United States &s;hall be a party.</HI>"</P>
<P>Now, let me a&s;k, whether the ca&s;es that are to fall under the juri&s;diction of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are not, 1&s;t, A ca&s;e un|der <HI>a treaty made?</HI> and 2d, whether the United States are not parties?

Should the trea&s;urer of the United States pay money out of the trea&s;ury in pur&s;uance of any adjudication of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, and be afterwards called to an account for the &s;ame, before the judges of the &s;upreme court, could he expect that they would &s;uffer him to i&s;&s;ue an order which cla&s;hes with their own powers and dero|gates fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">e con&s;titution?

<P>THE remaining allegations, in di&s;paragement of the third article, are to this effect
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the exception of the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, owing to its underfined limits, renders the &s;tipulations in our favor, in a great mea&s;ure, nugatory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the privileges granted to Great Britain in our Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi ports, are impolitic, becau&s;e without reciprocity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on pel|tries, is the &s;urrender, without equivalent, of a valuable item of revenue, and will give the Briti&s;h the facility of carrying on their fur trade through us, with the u&s;e of our advantages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the articles, which will be brought from Europe into Canada, coming duty free, can be afforded cheaper than the &s;ame articles going thither from us, charged with a heavy duty on their importation into the United States, and with the ex|pen&s;e of a long tran&s;portation by land, and inland navigation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the population of Canada, which, by a cen&s;us in 1784, amounted only to 123, 082 &s;ouls, is too &s;mall to render the &s;upply of European and A&s;iatic commodities, throu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, of &s;o much importance as to bear any compari&s;on with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lo&s;s by the &s;acrifice of the fur trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the intercour&s;e to be permitted with the Briti&s;h territories will fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tate &s;muggling, to the injury of our revenue.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the much greater extent of the United States than of the Briti&s;h territories, de&s;troys real reciprocity in the privileges granted by this article, giving, in fact, far greater advantages than are received.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the order in which they are here &s;tated:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It is true, that the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay compa|ny is not well defined. Their charter, granted in 1670, gives them "the &s;ole trade and commerce of and to all the &s;eas, bays, &s;treights, creeks, lakes, rivers, and &s;ounds, in what&s;o|ever latitude they &s;hall be, that he within the entrance of the &s;treights commonly called Hud&s;on's Streights, together with all the lands, countries, and territories upon the coa&s;ts and con|fines of the &s;aid &s;eas, &s;treights, bays, &amp;c. <HI>which are now ac|tually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any of our &s;ubjects, or by the &s;ubjects of any other Chri&s;tian prince of &s;tate</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="028389_0253_0FD8E970130A0DD0">
To a&s;certain their territorial limits, according to charter, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know what portion of country, at the time of the grant, was <HI>actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> by the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, or of &s;ome other Chri&s;tian prince or &s;tate; but though this be not known, the general hi&s;tory of the country, as to &s;ettlement, will demon&s;trate, that it could not have extended far we&s;tward, certainly not to that region which is the &s;cene of trade in furs, commonly called the north we&s;t trade, carried on by the Canada company from Canada; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as far as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion exi&s;ts, is recent. We learn from a traveller who has lately vi&s;ited that region, that one of this company's e&s;tabli&s;hments is in lat. 56, 9, N. long. 117, 43, W. that is, about 20 degrees of longitude we&s;tward of the lake of the Woods; and it is generally under&s;tood, that the entire &s;cene of the trade of this company is we&s;tward of the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company.</P>
<P>Canada, on the north, is bounded by the territories of the Hud&s;on's Bay company.&mdash;This is admitted by the treaty of Utrecht, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the act of parliament in 1774, commonly called the Quebec act.&mdash;The treaty of Utrecht pro|vides for the &s;ettlement of the boundaries by commi&s;&s;aries. I have not been able to trace whether the line was ever actually &s;o &s;ettled; but &s;everal maps lay down a line as the one &s;ettled by the treaty of Utrecht, which runs north of the lake of the Woods.</P>
<P>In a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us &s;ituated, the United States will ju&s;tly claim, under the article, acce&s;s to all that country, the trade of which is now carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">through Canada. This will re&s;ult both from the certainty that there were no actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, at the dare of the charter, &s;o far interior, and from the fact of the trade being carried on through a different channel, by a different company, under the &s;uperintendance and protection of dif|ferent government, that of Canada. It may be a&s;ked, why was the article embarra&s;&s;ed by the exception of the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay company? The an&s;wer is this, That the charter of this company gives to it a monopoly within its limits, and, therefore, a right to trade there could not have been granted, with propriety, to a foreign power, by treaty. It is true that it has been que&s;tioned, whether this monopoly was valid again&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;eeing that the charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament. But be&s;ides that this doubt has been con&s;ined to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, it would appear, that, in fact, the company has enjoyed the monopoly granted by its charter, even again&s;t them, and with at lea&s;t the implied approbation of par|liament. In the year 1749, petitions were preferred to the
<PB N="255" REF="028389_0254_0FD8E9720C5881D8">hou&s;e of commons, by different trading towns in England, for re&s;cinding the monopoly, and opening the trade.&mdash;An enquiry was in&s;tituted by the hou&s;e. The report of its committee was favorable, to the conduct and preten&s;ions of the company, and again&s;t the expediency of opening the trade; and the bu&s;ine&s;s terminated there.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance of there being a monopoly, confirms the argument drawn from the fact, that the north we&s;t trade is carried on through Canada by the Canada company: a deci&s;ive pre&s;umption, that the &s;cene of that trade is not within the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, and is, con&s;equently, within the operation of the privilege granted to us.</P>
<P>Though it will be partly a digre&s;&s;ion, I cannot forbear, in this place, to notice &s;ome ob&s;ervations of CATO, in his Xth number&mdash;After &s;tating, that in 1784 the peltry from Canada &s;old in London for 230, 000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, he proceeds to ob&s;erve, that, excluding the territories of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, nine-tenths of this trade is within the limits of the United States; and, though with &s;tudied ambiguity of expre&s;&s;ion, he endeavours to have it under&s;tood, that nine-tenths of the trade which yielded the peltry, that &s;old for 230, 000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling in 1784, was within our territories. It is natural to a&s;k, how he has a&s;certained the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company (which, at other times, is a&s;&s;erted, by way of objection to the article, to be altogether indefinite) with &s;o much exactne&s;s as to be able to pronounce what proportion, if any, of the trade carried on through Canada may have come from that country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wards the calculation which has led to the conclu&s;ion, that nine-tenths of the whole lies within our limits? The truth is indubitably and notoriou&s;ly, that whether any or whatever part of the peltry exported from Canada may come from the country of the Hud|&s;on's Bay company, &s;even-eights<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some &s;tatements rate it between &s;ix-eights and &s;even-eighths.</NOTE> of the whole trade which fur|ni&s;hes that peltry, has its &s;ource on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the boundary line. It follows, that if it were even true, that only one-tenth of the whole lay in that part of the Briti&s;h territory, which is not of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, ina&s;much as only one-&s;eventh of it lies within our limits, the re&s;ult would be, that the trade, in which we granted an equal privilege, was to that in which a like privilege is granted to us, as one|&s;eventh to one-tenth, and not, according to Cato, as nine to one. This legerdemain, in argument and calculation, is really too frivolous for &s;o &s;erious a &s;ubject. Or, to &s;peak more pro|perly, it is too &s;hocking, by the &s;pirit of deception which it
<PB N="256" REF="028389_0255_0FD8E9730F6B47E8">betrays. Cato has a further ob&s;ervation, with regard to the trade with the Indians, in the vicinity of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ppi, and from that river into the Spani&s;h territories.&mdash;The product of all this trade, he &s;ays, mu&s;t go down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and, but for the &s;tipulation of the third article, would have been exclu&s;ively ours; becau&s;e, "by the treaty of Paris, though the Briti&s;h might navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, yet they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks; whereas the United States po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Indian country, in the vicinity of that river and the ea&s;t bank for many hundred miles, could, when they plea&s;ed, e&s;tabli&s;h factories and monopolize that commerce." This a&s;&s;er|tion, with regard to the treaty of Paris, is in every &s;en&s;e incor|rect; for the &s;eventh article of that treaty, e&s;tabli&s;hes as a boundary between the dominions of France and his Britannic maje&s;ty, "a line drawn along the middle of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi, from its &s;ource to the river Iberville, and from thence by a line drawn along the middle of this river and the lakes Maure|pas and Pont Chartraim to the &s;ea," and cedes to his Britannic maje&s;ty all the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. By the treaty of Paris then, his Britannic maje&s;ty owned all, ex|cept the town and i&s;land of New Orleans, the territory on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in&s;tead of not having a foot of land there.</P>
<P>What part of this territory does not &s;till belong to him, is a point not yet &s;ettled. The treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, &s;uppo&s;es that part will remain to Great Britain; for one line of boundary between us and her, de&s;ignated by that treaty is a line due we&s;t from the lake of the woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. If, in fact, this river runs far enough north to be interfected by &s;uch a line, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition of the la&s;t mentioned treaty, &s;o much of that river, and the land upon it, as &s;hall be north of the line of inter&s;ec|tion, will continue to be of the dominion of Great Britain. The lately-made treaty, not abandoning the po&s;&s;ibility of this being the ca&s;e, provides for a &s;urvey to a&s;certain the fact; and in every event, the intent of the treaty of peace will require, that &s;ome clo&s;ing line, more or le&s;s direct, &s;hall be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The po&s;ition there|fore, that Great Britain has no land or ports on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, takes for granted, what is not a&s;certained, and of which the contrary is pre&s;umed by the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>The trade with the Indian country on our &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi, from the Ohio to the lake of the Woods (if that river extends &s;o far north) &s;ome fragments excepted, has its pre&s;ent direction through Detriot and Michillimachinac, and is in|cluded
<PB N="257" REF="028389_0256_0FD8E979767FB8A0">in many calculations, heretofore &s;tated, of the proportion which the Indian trade within our limits, bears to that within the Briti&s;h limits. Its e&s;timated amount is even under&s;tood to embrace the proceeds of a clande&s;tine trade with the Spain&s;h territories; &s;o that the new &s;cene &s;uddenly explored by Cato, is old and trodden ground, the &s;pecial reference to which can|not vary the re&s;ults that have been pre&s;ented. It is &s;till unque&s;|tionably and notoriou&s;ly true, that the fur trade within our limits, bears no proportion to that within the Briti&s;h limits. As to a contingent traffic with the territories of Spain, each party will be free to pur&s;ue it according to right and opportu|nity; each would have, independent of the treaty, the facility of bordering territories. The geography of the be&s;t regions of the fur trade, in the Spani&s;h territories, is too little known, to be much rea&s;oned upon; and if the Spaniards, according to their u&s;ual policy, incline to exclude their neighbours, their precautions along the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi will render the acce&s;s to it circuitous: a circum&s;tance which makes it problematical, whe|ther the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the oppo&s;ite bank is, as to that object, an advantage or not, and whether we may not find it conveni|ent to be able, under the treaty, to take a circuit through the Briti&s;h territories.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is upon the &s;ugge&s;tion of Great Britain having no ports on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, that the charge of want of reciprocity in the privileges granted, with regard to the u&s;e of that river, is founded. The &s;ugge&s;tion has been &s;hown to be more peremptory than is ju&s;tified by facts. Yet it is &s;till true, that the ports on our &s;ide bear no proportion to any that can exi&s;t on the part of the Briti&s;h, according to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of territory. It will be examined in a &s;ub&s;equent place, how far this di&s;proportion is a proper rule in the e&s;timate of reciprocity. But let it be ob|&s;erved, in the mean time, that in judging of the reciprocity of an article, it is to be taken collectively. If, upon the whole, the privileges obtained, are as valuable as tho&s;e granted, there is a &s;ub&s;tantial reciprocity; and to this te&s;t, upon full and fair examination of the article, I freely refer the deci&s;ion. Be&s;ides, if the &s;ituation of Great Britain did not permit in this particular, a preci&s;e equivalent, it will not follow that the grant on our part was improper, unle&s;s it can be &s;hown, that it was attended with &s;ome inconvenience, injury, or lo&s;s to us; a thing which has not been, and I believe cannot be &s;hown. Perhaps there is a very importantly beneficial &s;ide to this que&s;tion. The treaty of peace e&s;tabli&s;hed between us and Great Britain, a common intere&s;t in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; the pre&s;ent treaty &s;trengthens that common intere&s;t. Every body knows, that the u&s;e of the river is denied &s;o by Spain, and that it is an Indi&s;pen&s;ible outlet to
<PB N="258" REF="028389_0257_0FD8E97AAB756590">our we&s;tern country. Is it an inconvenient thing to us, that the intere&s;t of Great Britain has, in this particular, been more completely &s;eparated from that of Spain and more clo&s;ely con|nected with ours?</P>
<P N="3">3. The agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on pel|tries, is completely defen&s;ible on the following grounds, viz. It is the general policy of commercial nations to exempt raw materials from duty. This has likewi&s;e been the uniform policy of the United States; and it has particularly embraced the article of <HI>peltries,</HI> which, by our exi&s;ting laws, may be import|ed into any part of the United States <HI>free from duty.</HI> The ob|ject of this regulation is the encouragement of manufactures, by facilitating a cheap &s;upply of raw materials. A duty of entry, therefore, as to &s;uch part of the article as might be worked up at home, would be prejudicial to our manufacturing intere&s;t; as to &s;uch part as might be exported, if the duty was not drawn back, would injure our commercial intere&s;t. But it is the general policy of our laws, in conformity with the prac|tice of other commercial countries, to draw back and return the duties which are charged upon the importation of foverign commodities. This has reference to the advancement of the export trade of the country; &s;o that, with regard to &s;uch pel|tries as &s;hould be re-exported, there would be no advantage to our revenue from having laid a duty of entry. Such a duty, then, being contrary to our e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem and to true princi|ples, there can be no objection to a &s;tipulation again&s;t it.&mdash; As to its having the effect of making our country the channel of the Briti&s;h trade in peltries, this, if true, and it is indeed probable, could not but promote our intere&s;t. A large propor|tion of the profits would then nece&s;&s;arily remain with us, to, compen&s;ate for tran&s;portation and agencies. It is likely, too that to &s;ecure the fidelity of agents, as is u&s;ual, copartner&s;hips would be formed, of which Briti&s;h capital would be the prin|cipal in&s;trument, and which would throw a &s;till greater pro|portion of the profits into our hands. The more we can make our country the entrepot, the emporium of the trade of foreigners, the more we &s;hall profit. There is no commercial principle more obvious than this, more univer&s;ally agreed, or more ge|nerally nerally practi&s;ed upon, in countries where commerce is well under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth of the above enumerated &s;ugge&s;tions, is an|&s;wered, in its principal point, by the practice ju&s;t &s;tated, of drawing back the duties on importation, when articles are re|exported. This would place the articles, which we &s;hould &s;end into the Briti&s;h territories, exactly upon the &s;ame footing, as
<PB N="259" REF="028389_0258_0FD8E97D927743B0">to duties, with the &s;ame articles imported there from Europe. With regard to the additional expen&s;e of tran&s;portation, this is another in&s;tance of the contradiction of an argument, which has been relied upon by both &s;ides, which is, that taking the voyage from Europe in conjunction with the interior tran&s;port|ation, the advantage, upon the whole, is likely to be in our favor. And it is upon this aggregate tran&s;portation, that the calculation ought to be made. With re&s;pect to India or A&s;iatic articles, there is the circum&s;tance of a double voyage.</P>
<P N="5">5. As to the &s;mall population of Canada, which is urged to depreciate the advantages of the trade with the white inhabi|tants of tho&s;e countries, it is to be ob&s;erved, that this popula|tion is not &s;tationary. If the date of the cen&s;us be rightly quoted, it was taken eleven years ago, when there were alrea|dy 123, 082 &s;ouls. It is pre&s;umable, that this number will &s;oon be doubled; for it is notorious, that &s;ettlement has proceeded for &s;ome years with con&s;iderable rapidity in Upper Canada; and there is no rea&s;on to believe that the future progre&s;s will be &s;low. In time to come, the trade may grow into real mag|nitude; but be it more or le&s;s beneficial, it is &s;o much gaified by the article; and &s;o much clear gain, &s;ince it has been &s;hown not to be true, that it is counterbalanced by a &s;acrifice in the fur trade.</P>
<P N="6">With regard to the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of &s;muggling, in the intercour&s;e permitted by this article, it is very probable, it will be found le&s;s than if it were prohibited. Entirely to prevent trade between bordering territories is a very arduous, perhaps an impracticable ta&s;k. If not authorized, &s;o much as is carried on mu&s;t be illicit; and it may be rea&s;onably pre&s;umed, that the extent of illicit trade will be much greater in that ca&s;e, than where an intercour&s;e is permitted, under the u&s;ual regu|lations and guards. In the la&s;t ca&s;e, the inducement to it is le&s;s, and &s;uch as will only influence per&s;ons of little character or principle, while every fair trader is, from private intere&s;t, a centinel to the laws; in the other ca&s;e, all are intere&s;ted to break through the barriers of a rigorous and apparently unkind prohibition. This con&s;ideration has probably had its weight with our government in opening a communication through lake Champlain with Canada; of the principle of which regu|lation, the treaty is only an exten&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. The pretended inequality of the article, as ari&s;ing from the greater extent of the United States than of the Briti&s;h ter|ritories, is one of tho&s;e fanciful po&s;itions, which are &s;o apt to haunt the brains of vi&s;ionary politicians. Traced through all its con&s;equences, it would terminate in this, that a great em|pire
<PB N="260" REF="028389_0259_0FD8E97F18C8D170">could never form a treaty of commerce with a &s;mall one; for, to equalize advantages according to the &s;cale of territory, the &s;mall &s;tate mu&s;t compen&s;ate for its deficiency in extent, by a greater <HI>quantum</HI> of po&s;itive privilege, in proportion to the difference of extent, which would give the larger &s;tate the monopoly of its trade. According to this principle, what wretched treaties have we made with France, Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Holland! For our territories exceed in extent tho&s;e of either of the&s;e powers. How immen&s;e the &s;acrifice in the ca&s;e of Holland; for the United States are one hundred times larger than the United Provinces.</P>
<P>But how are we &s;ure, that the extent of the United States is greater than the territories of Great Britain on our conti|nent? We know that &s;he has preten&s;ions to extend to the Paci|fice Ocean, and to embrace a va&s;t wilderne&s;s, incomparably larger than the United States, and we are told, as already men|tioned, that her trading e&s;tabli&s;hments now actually extend beyond the 56th degree of north latitude, and 117th degree of we&s;t longitude.</P>
<P>Shall we be told (&s;hifting the original ground) that not extent of territory, but extent of population is the mea&s;ure? Then how great is the advantage which we gain in this particular, by the treaty at large? The population of Great Britain is to that of the United States, about two and a half to one; and the comparative conce&s;&s;ion by her in the trade between her Eu|ropean dominions and the United States, mu&s;t be in the &s;ame ratio. When we add to this the great population of her Ea&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in which privileges are granted to us, with|out any return, how prodigiou&s;ly will the value of the treaty be enhanced, according to this new and extraordinary rule!</P>
<P>But the rule is, in fact, an ab&s;urd one, and only merits the notice which has been taken of it, to exhibit the weak grounds of the oppo&s;ition to the treaty. The great &s;tandard of recipro|city is equal privilege. The adventitious circum&s;tances, which may render it more beneficial to one party than the other, can &s;eldom be taken into the account, becau&s;e they can &s;eldom he e&s;timated with certainly; the relative extent of country or po|pulation, is of all others, a mo&s;t fallacious guide.</P>
<P>The comparative re&s;ources and facilities for mutual &s;upply, regulate the relative utility of a commercial privilege; and as far as population is concerned, it may be laid down, as a gene|ral rule, that the &s;malle&s;t population graduates the &s;cale of the trade on both &s;ides, &s;ince it is at once the principal mea&s;ure of what the &s;maller &s;tate can furni&s;h to the greater, and of what it can take from the greater; or, in other words, of what the
<PB N="261" REF="028389_0260_0FD8E980991D1F78">greater &s;tate can find a demand for in the &s;maller &s;tate. But this rule, too, like mo&s;t general ones, admits of numerous exceptions.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of a trade by land and inland navigation, the &s;phere of the operation of any privilege can only extend a certain di&s;tance. When the di&s;tance to a given point, through a par|ticular channel, is &s;uch that the expen&s;e of tran&s;portation would render an article dearer than it could be brought through ano|ther channel to the &s;ame point, the privilege to carry the article through that particular channel to &s;uch point, becomes of no avail. Thus the privilege of trading by land or inland naviga|tion from the Briti&s;h territories on this continent, can procure to that country no advantage of trade with Princeton in New-Jer&s;ey, becau&s;e &s;upplies can come to it on better terms from other quarters. Whence we perceive, that the ab&s;olute extent of territory or population of the United States, is no mea&s;ure of the relative value of the privileges reciprocally granted by the article under con&s;ideration, and, con&s;equently, no criterion of the real reciprocity of the article.</P>
<P>The objectors to the treaty have mar&s;halled again&s;t this arti|cle a quaint figure, of which from the u&s;e of it in different quarters, it is pre&s;umable they are not a little enamoured; it is this, that the article enables Great Britain to draw <HI>a line of circumvallation</HI> round the United States. They hope to excite prejudice, by pre&s;enting to the mind, the image of a &s;iege or inve&s;tment of the country. If trade be war, they have cho&s;en a mo&s;t apt figure; and we cannot but wonder, how the unfor|tunate i&s;land of Great Britain, has been able &s;o long to main|tain her independence amid&s;t the beleaguering efforts of the number of nations with whom &s;he has been imprudent enough to form treaties of commerce; and who, from her in&s;ular &s;itu|ation, have it in their power to be&s;et and hem her in on all &s;ides. How lucky it is for the United States, that at lea&s;t one &s;ide is covered by Spain, and that this formidable line of cir|cumvallation cannot be completely perfected! or rather how hard driven mu&s;t tho&s;e be, who are obliged to call to their aid, auxiliaries &s;o prepo&s;terous!</P>
<P>Can any good rea&s;on be given, why one &s;ide of a country &s;hould not be acce&s;&s;ible to foreigners, for purpo&s;es of trade, equally with another? Might not the cultivators on the &s;ide from which they were excluded, have cau&s;e to complain, that the carriage of their productions was &s;ubject to an increa&s;ed charge, by a monopoly of the national navigation; while the cultivators in other quarters enjoyed the benefit of a competi|tion between that and foreign navigation? and might not all the inhabitants have a right to demand a rea&s;on, why their
<PB N="262" REF="028389_0261_0FD8E98BD3D0FF80">commerce &s;hould be le&s;s open and free, than that of other parts of the country? Will privileges of trade extend the line of territorial circumvallation? Will not the extent of contigu|ous Briti&s;h territory remain the &s;ame, whether the communica|tions of trade are open or &s;hut? By opening them, may we not rather be &s;aid to make &s;o many breaches in the wall, or intrenchment, of this newly invented circumvallation? if in|deed it be not enchanted!</P>
<P>The argument upon this article, has hitherto turned, as to the trade with the white inhabitants of the Briti&s;h territories on European and Ea&s;t India goods. But there can be no doubt that a mutually-beneficial commerce in native commodition ought to be included in the catalogue of advantages. Already there is a u&s;eful interchange of certain commodities, which time and the progre&s;s of &s;ettlement and re&s;ources cannot fail to extend. It is mo&s;t probable, too, that a con&s;iderable part of the productions of the Briti&s;h territories will find the mo&s;t con|venient channel to foreign markets through us; which, as for as it regards the intere&s;t of external commerce, will yield li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> le&s;s advantage, than if they proceeded from our own &s;oil or indu&s;try. It is evident, in particular, that as far as this &s;hall be the ca&s;e, it will prevent a great part of the competition with our commodities which would exi&s;t, if tho&s;e productions took other routes to foreign markets.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the &s;ubject, on the &s;ide of a trade in home commodities, it is an imporrtant reflection, that the United States are much more advanced in indu&s;trious improvement, than the Briti&s;h territories. This will give us a material and grow|ing advantage. While their articles of exchange with us will e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t in the products of agriculture and of mines, we &s;hall add to the&s;e, manufactures of various and multiplying kinds, &s;erving to increa&s;e the balance in our favor.</P>
<P>In proportion as the article is viewed on enlarged plan and permanent &s;cale, its importance to us magnifies. Who can &s;ay how far Briti&s;h colonization may &s;pread &s;outhward and down the we&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, northward and we&s;tward into the va&s;t interior regions towards the Pacific Ocean? Can we view it as a matter of indifference, that this new world is eventually laid open to our enterprize, to an enterprize &s;econd|ed by the immen&s;e advantage already mentioned, of a more improved &s;tate of indu&s;try? Can we be in&s;en&s;ible, that the precedent furni&s;hes us with a cogent and per&s;ua&s;ive argument to bring Spain to a &s;imilar arrangement? And can we be blind to the great intere&s;t we have, obtaining a free communica|tion
<PB N="263" REF="028389_0262_0FD8E98BD5FCFB88">with all the territories that environ our country, from the St. Mary's to the St. Croix.</P>
<P>In this large view of the &s;ubject, the fur trade, which has made a very prominent figure in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, becomes a point &s;carcely vi&s;ible. Objects of great variety and magnitude, &s;tart up in per&s;pective, eclip&s;ing the little atoms of the day, and promi&s;ing to grow and mature with time.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the whole is, that the United States; make by the third article of the treaty a good bargain&mdash;that with re|gard to the fur trade, with equality of privileges and &s;uperior advantages of &s;ituation, we &s;take one again&s;t &s;even, or at mo&s;t one again&s;t &s;ix&mdash;that as to the trade in European and Ea&s;t Indian goods and in home productions, we make an equal &s;take with &s;ome advantages of &s;ituation&mdash;that we open an im|men&s;e field of future enterprize&mdash;that we avoid embarra&s;&s;ments and dangers ever attendant on an artificial and prohibitory policy, which, in reference to the Indian nations, was particu|larly difficult and hazardous&mdash;and that we &s;ecure tho&s;e of a natural and liberal policy, and give the faire&s;t chances for good neighbourhood between the United States and the bordering Briti&s;h territories, and con&s;equently of good under&s;tanding with Great Britain, conducing to the &s;ecurity of our peace. Experience, no doubt, will demon&s;trate that the horrid &s;pec|tres which have been conjured up, are fictions; and if it &s;hould even be &s;low to realize the predicted benefits (for time will be requi&s;ite to give permanent cau&s;es their due effect in controul|ing temporary circum&s;tances) it will at la&s;t prove, that the pre|dicted evils are chimeras and cheats.</P>

<P>THE fourth and fifth articles of the treaty, from &s;imilarity of object, will naturally be con&s;idered together. The fourth, reciting a doubt, "whether the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi ex|tends &s;o far north-we&s;tward, as to be inter&s;ected by a line drawn due we&s;t from the lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned by the treaty of peace" agrees, that mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken in concert between the two governments, to make a joint &s;urvey of that river, from a degree of latitude below the
<PB N="264" REF="028389_0263_0FD8E98D74950B58">falls of St. Anthony, to the principal &s;ource or &s;ources there|of, and of the parts adjacent thereto; and that if in the re|&s;ult it &s;hould appear that the &s;aid river would not be inter|&s;ected by &s;uch a line as above mentioned, the two parties will proceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the boundary line in that quarter as well as all other points to be adju&s;ted between them, according to ju&s;tice and mutual convenience, and the intent of the treaty of peace.

<P>The&s;e articles, though they have been adju&s;ted with critical propriety, have not e&s;caped cen&s;ure. They have even in one in&s;tance been &s;everely reprobated, as bringing into que&s;tion, things about which there was no room for any&mdash;and which a bare in&s;pection of the map was &s;ufficient to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>With regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, there is no &s;atisfactory evi|dence that it has ever been explored to its &s;ource.&mdash;It is even a&s;&s;erted, that it has never been a&s;cended beyond the 45th de|gree of north latitude, about a degree above the falls of St. Anthony. Fadeus's map in 1793, will &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the great uncertainty which attends this matter. It notes that the river had not been a&s;cended beyond the degree of latitude ju&s;t mentioned, and exhibits three &s;treams, one connected with the <HI>Mar&s;hy Lake</HI> in that latitude, another with the <HI>White Bear Lake</HI> near the 46th degree, and the third with the <HI>Red Lake</HI> in the 47th degree; denominating each of the two fir&s;t, "the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi by conjecture," and the la&s;t, "Red Lake River, or Laboutan's Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,"&mdash;all of them falling con&s;iderably
<PB N="265" REF="028389_0264_0FD8E9904DDCEB70">&s;hort, in their northern extent, of the lake of the Woods, which is placed as high as the fiftieth degree of north latitude. Thus &s;tands this very clear and certain point, which, we are told, it was di&s;graceful on the part of our envoy to have &s;uf|fered to be brought into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There is, however, a &s;pecific topic of blame of the article which has greater plau&s;ibility. It is this, that it does not finally &s;ettle the que&s;tion, but refers the adju&s;tment of the clo&s;ing line to future negociation, in ca&s;e it &s;hould turn out that the river does not &s;tretch far enough north to be inter&s;ected by an ea&s;t and we&s;t line from the lake of the Woods. I an&s;wer, that the arrangement is preci&s;ely &s;uch as it ought to have been. It would have been premature to provide a &s;ub&s;titute till it was a&s;certained that it was nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;This could only be done by an actual &s;urvey&mdash;A &s;urvey is therefore provided for and will be made at the joint expen&s;e of the two countries.</P>
<P>That &s;urvey will not only determine whether a &s;ub&s;titute be requi&s;ite or not; but it will furni&s;h data for judging what &s;ub|&s;titute is proper, and mo&s;t conformable to the true intent of the treaty.&mdash;Without the data which it will afford, any thing that could have been done, would have been too much a leap in the dark. National acts, e&s;pecially on the important &s;ubject of boundary; ought to be bottomed on a competent knowledge of circum&s;tances. It ought to be clearly under&s;tood how much is retained, how much is relinqui&s;hed. Had our envoy proceeded on a different principle, if what he had agreed to had turned out well, it would have been regarded as, the lucky re&s;ult of an act of &s;upererogation&mdash;If it had proved di&s;advantageous, it would have been &s;tigmatized as an act of improvidence and imprudence.</P>
<P>The &s;trong argument for having &s;ettled an alternative is the avoiding of future di&s;pute. But what alternative could have been agreed upon, which might not have bred controver&s;y? The clo&s;ing line mu&s;t go directly or indirectly to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi&mdash;which of the &s;treams reputed or conjectured to be &s;uch, above the falls of St. Anthony, is be&s;t emitted to be &s;o confidered? To what known point was the line to be directed? How was that point to be identi&s;ied with adequate certainty? The diffi|culty of an&s;wering the&s;e que&s;tions, will evince, that the danger of controver&s;y might have been increa&s;ed by an impatience to avoid it, and by anticipating, without the nece&s;&s;ary lights, an adju&s;tment which they ought to direct.</P>
<P>The facts, with regard to the river St. Croix, are the&s;e: the que&s;tion is, which of two rivers is the true St. Croix. The di&s;pute concerning it is as old as the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova
<PB N="266" REF="028389_0265_0FD8E9921396D4E0">Scotia. France &s;et up one river; Great Britain another. The point was undecided when the &s;urrender of Nova Scotia by the former to the latter, put an end to the que&s;tion as between tho&s;e parties&mdash;It was afterwards renewed between the colonies of Nova Scotia and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, which la&s;t, in the year 1762, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to a&s;certain, in conjunction with commi&s;&s;ioners which might be appointed by the province of Nova Scotia, the true river, but no final &s;ettlement of the mat|ter en&s;ued.</P>
<P>The treaty of peace gives us for one boundary, the river St. Croix, but without de&s;ignating it. Hence it has happened, that not long after the peace was concluded, the que&s;tion, which had been before agitated between France and Great Britain, and between the provinces of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Nova Scotia, was revived between the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and that pro|vince, and it has ever &s;ince continued a &s;ubject of debate.</P>
<P>A mode of &s;ettling the di&s;pute was under the con&s;ideration of congre&s;s in the year 1785; and powers were given to our then mini&s;ter at the court of London, to adju&s;t the affair, but nothing was concluded. And we learn from a letter of Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, dated the 15th December, 1791, that it then al&s;o, engaged the attention of our government; that the a&s;certaining of the point in di&s;pute was deemed a mat|ter of "pre&s;ent urgency," and that it had before been the &s;ub|ject of application from the United States to the government of Great Britain.</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that a di&s;pute of &s;uch antiquity, be|tween &s;uch different parties, is not without colourable founda|tion on either &s;ide: at any rate, it was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;erva|tion of peace that it &s;hould be adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>If one party could not convince the other by argument, of the &s;uperior &s;olidity of its preten&s;ions, I know of no alternative but arbitration or war. Will any one pretend that honor required us in &s;uch a ca&s;e to go to war, or that the object was of a na|ture to make it our intere&s;t to refer it to that &s;olemn, calami|tous, and precarious i&s;&s;ue? No rational man will an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the affirmative. It follows, that an arbitration was the proper cour&s;e, and that our envoy acted rightly in acceding to this expedient. It is one, too, not without precedents among nations, though it were to be wi&s;hed, for the credit of human moderation, that they were more frequent.</P>
<P>Is there any good objection to the mode of the arbitration? It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that any one more fair or convenient could have been devi&s;ed, and it is recommended by its analogy to what is common among individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="028389_0266_0FD8E99A171B6F90">
What the mode is, has been already detailed, and need not be repeated here. It is objected, that too much has been left to chance; but no &s;ub&s;titute has been offered, which would have been attended with le&s;s ca&s;ualty. The fact is, that none &s;uch can be offere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash;Con&s;cious of this, tho&s;e who make the objec|tion have not thought fit to give an opportunity of compari&s;on by propo&s;ing a &s;ub&s;titute. What is left to chance? Not that there &s;hall be a final deci&s;ion; for this is mo&s;t effectually pro|vided for. It is not only po&s;itively &s;tipulated that commi&s;&s;ioners, with full and definitive power, &s;hall be appointed, but an ulti|mate choice is &s;ecured, by re&s;erring, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, to a de|ci&s;ion <HI>by lot,</HI> what it might not be practicable to decide by agree|ment. This is the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of precaution. Is it that this reference to lot leaves it too uncertain of what character or di&s;po&s;ition the third commi&s;&s;ioner may be? If this be not rather a recommendation of the fairne&s;s of the plan, how was it to remedied? Could it have been expected of either of the parties, to leave the nomination to the other? Certainly not. Would it have been advi&s;able to have referred the ultimate choice to &s;ome other &s;tate or government? Where would one have been found, in the opinion of both parties, &s;ufficiently imp&aacute;rtial? On which &s;ide would there have been the greate&s;t danger of a &s;ucce&s;sful employment of undue influence? Is it not evident, that this expedient would have added to equal uncertainty, as to character and di&s;po&s;ition, other ca&s;ualties and more delay? Should it have been left to the two commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by the parties to agree at all events? It might have been impo&s;|&s;ible for them to come to an agreement, and then the whole plan of &s;ettlement would have been fru&s;trated. Would the &s;word have been a more certain arbiter? Of all uncertain things, the i&s;&s;ues of war are the mo&s;t uncertain. What do ob|jections of this kind prove, but that there are per&s;ons re&s;olved to object at all events?</P>
<P>The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion to arbitration has been repre|&s;ented as an eventual di&s;memberment of empire, which, it has been &s;aid, cannot rightly be agreed to, but in a ca&s;e of extreme nece&s;&s;ity. This rule of extreme nece&s;&s;ity is manife&s;tly only ap|plicable to a ce&s;&s;ion or relinqui&s;hment of a part of a country, held by a clear and acknowledged title; not to a ca&s;e of di&s;|puted boundary.</P>
<P>It would be a horrid and de&s;tructive principle, that nations could not terminate a di&s;pute about the title to a particular par|cel of territory, by amicable agreement, or by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to arbitration as its &s;ub&s;titute; but would be under an indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation to pro&s;ecute the di&s;pute by arms, till real danger to
<PB N="268" REF="028389_0267_0FD8E99A19793D80">the exi&s;tence of one of the parties &s;hould ju&s;tify, by the plea of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, a &s;urrender of its preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the terms in which writers lay down the rule, and the rea&s;on of it, will in&s;truct us that where it does apply, it relates not to territory as &s;uch, but to tho&s;e who inhabit it, on the principle that the &s;ocial compact entitles all the members of the &s;ociety to be protected and maintained by the common &s;trength in their rights and relations as members. It is under|&s;tood, that the territory between the two rivers in di&s;pute, is either uninhabited, or inhabited only by &s;ettlers under the Bri|ti&s;h. If this be &s;o, it obviates all &s;hadow of difficulty on our &s;ide. But be it as it may, it would be an abu&s;e of the rule, to oppo&s;e it to the amicable adju&s;tment of an ancient controver&s;y, about the title to a particular tract of country, depending on a que&s;tion of fact, whether this or that river be the one truly in|tended by former treaties between the parties. The que&s;tion is not, in this ca&s;e, &s;hall we cede a part of our country to another power? It is this&mdash;To whom does this tract of country truly belong? Should the weight of evidence be on the Briti&s;h &s;ide, our faith, pledged by the treaty, would demand from us an acquie&s;cence in their claim. Not being able to agree in opinion on this point, it was mo&s;t equitable and mo&s;t agreeable to good faith to &s;ubmit it to an impartial arbitration.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked, among other things, whether the United States were competent to the adju&s;tment of the matters with|out the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Re&s;erving a more particular &s;olution of this que&s;tion to a &s;eparate di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of the con&s;titutionality of the treaty, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with remarking here, that our treaty of peace with Great Bri|tain, by &s;ettling the boundaries of the United States without the &s;pecific con&s;ent or authority of any &s;tate, a&s;&s;umes the prin|ciple, that the government of the United States was of it&s;elf competent to the regulation of boundary with foreign powers&mdash; that the actual government of the Union has even more plenary authority with regard to treaties, than was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the confederation, and that acts, both of the former and of the pre&s;ent government, pre&s;uppo&s;e the competency of the national authority to decide the que&s;tion in the very in&s;tance under con|&s;ideration. I am informed, al&s;o, that the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts has, by repeated acts, manife&s;ted a corre&s;ponding &s;en&s;e on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A reflection not unimportant occurs here. It was perhaps, in another &s;en&s;e than has been hitherto noticed, a point of pre|dence in both governments to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er the matter in di&s;pute to ar|bitration. If one had yielded to the preten&s;ions of the other, it
<PB N="269" REF="028389_0268_0FD8E99BE8DEA968">could hardly have failed to draw upon it&s;elf complaints, and cen&s;ures, more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, from quarters immediately intere&s;ted or affected.</P>

<P>THE &s;ixth article &s;tipulates compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h cre|ditors for lo&s;&s;es and damages which may have been &s;u&s;|tained by them, in con&s;equence of certain legal impediments, which, &s;ince the treaty of peace with Great Britain, are al|leged to have ob&s;tructed the recovery of debts <HI>bona fide</HI> con|tracted with them before the peace.</P>
<P>To a man who has a due &s;en&s;e of the &s;acred obligation of a ju&s;t debt, a proper conception of the pernicious influence of laws which infringe the rights of creditors, upon morals, upon the general &s;ecurity of property, upon public as well as private credit, upon the &s;pirit and principles of good government; who has an adequate idea of the &s;anctity of the national faith, ex|plicitly pledged&mdash;of the ignominy attendant upon a violation of it in &s;o delicate a particular as that of private pecuniary contracts&mdash;of the evil tendency of a precedent of this kind to the political and commercial intere&s;ts of the nation generally&mdash;every law which has exi&s;ted in this country, interfering with the recovery of the debts in que&s;tion, mu&s;t have afforded mat|ter of &s;erious regret and real afflicton. To &s;uch a man, it mu&s;t be among the mo&s;t welcome features of the pre&s;ent treaty, that it &s;tipulates reparation for the injuries which laws of that de|&s;cription may have occa&s;ioned to individuals, and that, as far as is now practicable, it wipes away from the national reputa|tion the &s;tain which they have ca&s;t upon it. He will regard it as a precious tribute to ju&s;tice, and as a valuable pledge for the more &s;trict future ob&s;ervance of our public engagements; and he would deplore as an ill-omened &s;ymptom of the depra|vation of public opinion, the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempts which are making to render the article unacceptable to the people of the United States. But of this there can be no danger. The &s;pontaneous &s;entiments of equity, of a moral and intelligent people, will not fail to &s;anction, with their approbation, a mea&s;ure which could not have been re&s;i&s;ted without inflicting a new wound upon the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nor and character of the country.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e men who have manife&s;ted by their actions, a wil|ling di&s;regard of their own obligations as debtors&mdash;tho&s;e who
<PB N="270" REF="028389_0269_0FD8E99D23243B28">&s;ecretly hoard, or openly and unblu&s;hingly riot on the &s;poils of plundered creditors, let &s;uch men enjoy the exclu&s;ive and undi|vided &s;atisfaction of arraigning and condemning an act of na|tional ju&s;tice, in which they may read the &s;evere&s;t reproach of their iniquitous principles and guilty acqui&s;tions. But let not the people of America tarni&s;h their honor by participating in that condemnation, or by &s;hielding with their favorable opinion, the meretricious apologies which are offered for the mea&s;ures that produced the nece&s;&s;ity of reparation.</P>
<P>The recapitulation of &s;ome facts will contribute to a right judgment of this part of the treaty.</P>
<P>It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle of the laws of nations, that, on the return of peace between nations which have been at war, a free and undi&s;turbed cour&s;e &s;hall be given to the recovery of private debts on both &s;ides.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotius, b. iii, c. xx. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. xvi.</NOTE> In conformity to this principle, the 4th article of the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, expre&s;sly &s;tipulates, "that creditors on either &s;ide &s;hall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted."</P>
<P>Two in&s;tances of the violation of this article have been al|ready noticed, with a view to another point; one relating to certain laws of the &s;tate of Virginia, pa&s;&s;ed prior to the peace, which, for &s;everal years after it, appears to have operated to prevent the legal pur&s;uit of their claims by Briti&s;h creditors. Another, relating to a law of the &s;tate of South Carolina, which &s;u&s;pended the recovery of the debts for nine months, and after that period permitted the recovery only in four years in&s;talments.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were not all the in&s;tances; there were other laws of South Carolina prolonging the in&s;talments, and obliging the creditors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o receive in payment the property of debtors at apprai&s;ed values; and there were laws of Rhode I&s;land, New Jer&s;ey, North Carolina, and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orgia, making paper money a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al tender for the debts of tho&s;e creditors; which, it is known, &s;u&s;tained a very great depreciation in every one of tho&s;e &s;tates. The&s;e very &s;erious and compul&s;ory interferences with the rights of the creditors, have received from Decius, the &s;oft appella|tion of a modification of the recovery of Briti&s;h debts. Does he expect to make us believe, by this &s;mooth phra&s;e, that the right to recover the full value of a debt in &s;terling money, is &s;atisfied by the obligation to take as a &s;ub&s;titute, one half, one third, or one fourth of the real value in paper?</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="028389_0270_0FD8E9A3220146C8">
It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have happened, that Briti&s;h creditors have &s;u&s;tained, from the operation of the different acts alluded to, lo&s;&s;es more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, which the mere removal of the legal impediments which occa&s;ioned them could not repair. In many in&s;tances, the lo&s;&s;es mu&s;t have actually accrued and taken their full effect: in others, where no proceedings may have been had, the lap&s;e of &s;o many years mu&s;t have created inabilities to pay, in debtors who were originally competent, who might have been made to pay, had there been a free cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The removal of the impediments, therefore, by opening of the courts of ju&s;tice, was not an adequate &s;atisfaction. It could not &s;uper&s;ede the obligation of compen&s;ation for lo&s;&s;es which had irretrievably accrued by the operation of the legal impe|diments, while they continued in force. The claim for this was &s;till open on the part of Great Britain, and &s;till to be adju&s;ted between the two nations.</P>
<P>The excu&s;e, that the&s;e laws were retaliations for prior in|fractions of treaty by Great Britain, was in no view an an&s;wer to the claim.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that this excu&s;e implies a palpable vio|lation of the then con&s;titution of the United States. The confederation ve&s;ted the powers of war and of treaty in the Union. It therefore lay exclu&s;ively with congre&s;s to pronounce, whether the treaty was or was not violated by Great Britain, and what &s;hould be the &s;atisfaction. No &s;tate, individually, had the lea&s;t right to meddle with the que&s;tion, and the having done it was an u&s;urpa|tion on the con&s;titutional authority of the United States
<P>It might be &s;hown, on a &s;imilar principle, that an confi&s;cations or &s;eque&s;tra|tions of <HI>Briti&s;h debts,</HI> by particular &s;tates, daring the war, were al&s;o uncon|&s;titutional.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as has already been proved, the fact of &s;uch prior infractions was too doubtful to be finally in&s;i&s;ted up|on, and was, after a fruitle&s;s effort to obtain the acquie&s;cence of the other party, properly and nece&s;&s;arily waved; &s;o that it could not &s;erve as a plea again&s;t reparation.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, if that fact had been indubitable, the &s;pecies of retaliation was unwarantable. It will be &s;hown, when we come to di&s;cu&s;s the 10th article, that the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bts of private individuals are in no ca&s;e a proper object of repri&s;als; that in|dependent of the treaty, the meddling with them was a violation of the public faith and integrity; and that, con&s;equently, it was due as much to our own public faith and integrity, as to the individual who had &s;uffered, to make reparation. It was an act demanded by the ju&s;tice, probity, and magnanimity of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="028389_0271_0FD8E9A54ADB8E68">
In the third place, it was e&s;&s;ential to reciprocity in the ad|ju&s;tment of the di&s;putes which had exi&s;ted concerning the trea|ty of peace. When we claimed the rein&s;tatement and execu|tion of the article with regard to the po&s;ts; it was ju&s;t that we &s;hould con&s;ent to the rein&s;tatement and execution of the article with regard to debts. If the ob&s;truction of the recovery of debts was the equivalent by way of retaliation for the deten|tion of the po&s;ts, we could not expect to have re&s;titution of the thing withheld, and to retain the equivalent for it likewi&s;e. The dilemma was, to be content with the equivalent, and abandon the thing; or to recover the thing, and abandon the equivalent: to have both was more than we could rightly pre|tend. The rein&s;tatement of the article, with regard to the debts, nece&s;&s;arily included two things, the removal of legal impediments as to the future recovery; compen&s;ation for pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es by rea&s;on of tho&s;e impediments. The fir&s;t had been ef|fected by the new con&s;titution of the United States; the la&s;t is promi&s;ed by the treaty.</P>
<P>Did our envoy reply, that the rein&s;tatement of the article with regard to the po&s;ts included likewi&s;e compen&s;ation for their detention? Was it an an&s;wer to this, de&s;titute of rea&s;on, that our lo&s;s, by the detention of the po&s;ts, which re&s;olved it&s;elf e&s;|&s;entially into the uncertain profits of a trade that might have been carried on, admitted of no &s;atisfactory rule of computa|tion; while the principal and intere&s;t of private debts afforded a familiar &s;tandard for the computation of lo&s;&s;es upon them: that, neverthele&s;s, while this was the u&s;ual, and mu&s;t be the admitted &s;tandard, it is an adequate one in ca&s;es where pay|ment is protracted beyond the allowed term of credit; &s;ince the mere intere&s;t of money does not countervail among mer|chants, the profits of its employment in trade, and &s;till le&s;s the derangements of credit and fortune, which frequently re|&s;ult to creditors, from procra&s;tinations of payment; and that the final damage to Great Britain, in the&s;e two particulars, for which no provi&s;ion could be made, might well exceed any lo&s;&s;es to us by the detention of the po&s;ts?</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, the compen&s;ation &s;tipulated was a <HI>fine qua non</HI> with Great Britain, of the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, and the adju&s;tment of the controver&s;y which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two countries. The making it &s;uch may be conceived to have been dictated more by the importance of the precedent, than by the quantum of the &s;um in que&s;tion. We &s;hall ea&s;ily under|&s;tand this, if we con&s;ider how much the commercial capital of Great Britain is &s;pread over the world. The va&s;t credits &s;he is in the habit of extending to foreign countries, renders it to
<PB N="273" REF="028389_0272_0FD8E9A70D400B48">her an e&s;&s;ential point to protect tho&s;e credits by all the &s;anc|tions in her power.&mdash;She cannot forbear to contend at every hazard again&s;t precedents of the inva&s;ion of the rights of her merchants, and for retribution where any happen. Hence it is always to be expected, that &s;he will be peculiarly inflexible on this point: and that nothing &s;hort of extreme nece&s;&s;ity can bring her to relax in an article of policy, which perhaps not le&s;s than any other, is a nece&s;&s;ary prop of the whole &s;y&s;tem of her political economy.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, to have been fore&s;een that whenever our controver&s;y with Great Britain was adju&s;ted, compen&s;ation for ob&s;tructions to the recovery of debts would make a part of the adju&s;tment. The option lay between compen&s;ation, relinqui&s;h|ment of the po&s;ts, or war. Our envoy is entitled to the ap|plau&s;e of all good men, for preferring the fir&s;t. The extent of the compen&s;ation can on no po&s;&s;ible &s;cale compare with the im|men&s;e permanent value of the po&s;ts, or with the expen&s;es of war. The &s;phere of the interferences has been too partial to make the &s;um of the compen&s;ation, in any event, a very &s;eri|ous object; and as to a war, a con&s;cientious or virtuous mind could never endure the thoughts of &s;eeing the country involved in its calamities, to get rid of an act of ju&s;tice to individuals, who&s;e rights, in contempt of public faith, had been violated.</P>
<P>Having reviewed the general con&s;iderations which ju&s;tify the &s;tipulation of compen&s;ation, it will be proper to examine if the plan upon which it is to be made, is unexceptionable.</P>
<P>This plan contains the following features,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1.

<ITEM>6. The commi&s;&s;ioners are empowered to take into con&s;idera|tion all claims, whether of principal or intere&s;t, or balances of principal and intere&s;t, and to determine them according to the merits and circum&s;tances thereof, and as ju&s;tice and equity &s;hall appear to them to require&mdash;to examine per&s;ons on oath or affirmation, and to receive in evidence, depo&s;itions, books, papers, or copies, or extracts thereof, either according to the legal forms exi&s;ting in the two countries, or according to a mode to be devi&s;ed by them.</ITEM>

<P>It is confined to debts contracted before the peace, and &s;till owing to the creditors. It embrances only the ca&s;es of lo&s;s or damage in con&s;equence of legal impediments to the reco|very of tho&s;e debts which will exclude all ca&s;es of voluntary compromi&s;e, and can include none, where the laws have al|lotted a free cour&s;e to ju&s;tice. It can operate in no in&s;tance where, at pre&s;ent, <HI>the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice</HI> is competent to full relief, and the debter is &s;olvent; nor in any, where in|&s;olvency or other cau&s;e would have operated to produce the lo&s;s or damage, if no legal impediment had exi&s;ted, or where it has been occa&s;ioned by the wilful delay, negligence, or omi&s;&s;ion of the creditor.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that the commi&s;&s;ioners have neverthele&s;s much latitude of di&s;cretion, and that in the exerci&s;e of it they may tran&s;gre&s;s the limits intend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, the an&s;wer is, that the United States, though bound to perform what they have &s;tipulated with good faith, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> bound to &s;ubmit to a manife&s;t
<PB N="275" REF="028389_0274_0FD8E9B04A49C618">abu&s;e of authority by the commi&s;&s;ioners. Should they palpa|bly exceed their commi&s;&s;ion, or abu&s;e their tru&s;t, the United States may ju&s;tifiably, though at their peril, refu&s;e compliance. For example, if they &s;hould undertake to award upon a debt contracted &s;ince the peace, there could be no doubt that their award would be a nullity. So likewi&s;e there may be other plain ca&s;es of mi&s;conduct, which, in honor and con&s;cience, would exonerate the United States from performance. It is only in|cumbent upon them to act, <HI>bona fide,</HI> and as they act at their peril, to examine well the &s;oundne&s;s of the ground on which they proceed.</P>
<P>With regard to the reference to commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;ettle the quantum of the compen&s;ation to be made, this cour&s;e was dic|tated by the nature of the ca&s;e. The tribunals of neither coun|try were competent to a retro&s;pective adju&s;tment of lo&s;&s;es and damages, in many ca&s;es which might require it. It is for this very rea&s;on of the incompetency of the ordinary tribunals to do complete ju&s;tice, that a &s;pecial &s;tipulation of compen&s;ation, and a &s;pecial mode of obtaining it, became nece&s;&s;ary. In con|&s;tituting a tribunal to liquidate the quantum of reparation, in the ca&s;e of a breach of treaty, it was natural and ju&s;t to de|vi&s;e one likely to be more certainly impartial than the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed courts of either party. Without impeaching the inte|grity of tho&s;e courts, it was morally impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould not feel a bias towards the nation to which they belonged, and for that very rea&s;on they were unfit arbitrators. In the ca&s;e of the &s;poliations of our property, we &s;hould undoubtedly have been unwilling to leave the adju&s;tment in the la&s;t re&s;ort to the Briti&s;h courts; and by parity of rea&s;on, they could not be ex|pected to refer the liquidation of compen&s;ation in the ca&s;e of the debts to our courts. To have pre&s;&s;ed this would have been to weaken our argument for a different cour&s;e in regard to the &s;poliations. We &s;hould have been puzzled to find a &s;ub&s;tan|tial principle of di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>If a &s;pecial and extraordinary tribunal was to be con&s;tituted, it was impracticable to contrive a more fair and equitable plan for it than that which has been adopted. The remarks on the mode of determining the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the river St. Croix, apply in full force here, and would render a particu|lar comment &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>To the objection of the Charle&s;ton committee, that the ar|ticle erects a tribunal unknown to our con&s;titution, and trans|fers to commi&s;&s;ioners the cognizance of matters appertaining to American courts and juries, the an&s;wer is &s;imple and con|clu&s;ive. The tribunals e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution do not
<PB N="276" REF="028389_0275_0FD8E9B20E2DCA90">contemplate a ca&s;e between nation and nation ari&s;ing upon a breach of treaty, and are inadequate to the cognizance of it.&mdash; Could either of them hold plea of a &s;uit of Great Britain plaintiff, again&s;t the United States, defendant? The ca&s;e, therefore, required the erection or con&s;titution of a new tri|bunal; and it was mo&s;t likely to promote equity to pa&s;s by the courts of both the parties.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principle contradicts the po&s;ition, that there has been any transfer of juri&s;diction from American courts and juries to commi&s;&s;ioners. It is a que&s;tion not between individual and individual, or between our government and individuals, but between our government and the Briti&s;h government; of cour&s;e, one in which our courts and juries have no juri&s;diction. There was a nece&s;&s;ity for an extraordinary tribunal to &s;upply the defect of ordinary juri&s;diction; and &s;o far is the article from making the transfer imputed to it, that it expre&s;sly ex|cepts the ca&s;es in which effectual relief can be obtained in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Nations acknowledging no common judge on earth, when they are willing to &s;ubmit the que&s;tion between them to a ju|dicial deci&s;ion, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity con&s;titute a &s;pecial tribunal for the purpo&s;e. The mode by commi&s;&s;ioners, as being the mo&s;t unexceptionable, has been repeatedly adopted.</P>
<P>I proceed to reply to &s;ome other objections which have been made again&s;t the provi&s;ion contained in this article.</P>
<P>It is charged with affixing a &s;tigma on the national character, by providing reparation for an infraction, which, if it ever did exi&s;t, has been done away, there being now a free cour&s;e to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts in the courts of the United States.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer to this objection has been anticipated by &s;ome ob&s;ervations heretofore made. The giving a free cour&s;e to ju&s;|tice in favor of Briti&s;h creditors, which has been effected by the new con&s;titution of the United States, though it obviates the future operation of legal impediment, does not retro&s;pec|tively repair the lo&s;&s;es and damages which may have re&s;ulted from their pa&s;t operation. In this re&s;pect, the effects continued, and reparation was due. To promi&s;e it, could fix no &s;tigma on our national character. That was done by the acts which cre|ated the cau&s;e for reparation. To make it, was as far as po&s;&s;i|ble to remove the &s;tigma.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the promi&s;e of compen&s;ation produces inju&s;tice to tho&s;e &s;tates which interpo&s;ed no legal impediments to the recovery of debts, by &s;addling them with a part of the burden ari&s;ing from the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">quencies of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing &s;tates.
<PB N="277" REF="028389_0276_0FD8E9B451DA4448">But the burden was before a&s;&s;umed by the treaty of peace. The article of that treaty, which engaged that there &s;hould be no lawful impediments to the recovery of debts, was a guarantee by the United States of ju&s;tice to the Briti&s;h creditors. It charged them with the duty of taking care that there was no legal ob&s;tacle to the recovery of the debts of tho&s;e creditors, and con&s;equently with a re&s;pon&s;ibility for any &s;uch ob&s;tacle which &s;hould happen, and with the obligation of making repa|ration for it. We mu&s;t, therefore, refer to the treaty of peace, not to the la&s;t treaty, the common charge which has been in|curred by interference in the recovery of Briti&s;h debts. The latter only carries into execution the promi&s;e made by the for|mer. It may be added that it is a condition of the &s;ocial compact that the nation at large &s;hall make retribution to foreign nations for injuries done to them by its members.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on has clearly &s;hown, that intere&s;t in ca&s;es like that of Briti&s;h debts, is liable, during the period of the war, to equitable abatements and deductions; and that, therefore, the di&s;cretion given to the commi&s;&s;ioners on this head ought not to have been as large as it appears in the article.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on has, no doubt, offered arguments of real weight to e&s;tabli&s;h the po&s;ition that judges and juries have, and exerci&s;e, a degree of di&s;cretion in any article of intere&s;t; and that the circum&s;tances of our war with Great Britain, afford &s;trong rea&s;ons for abatements of intere&s;t. But it was foreign to his purpo&s;e, and accordingly he has not attempted to particu|lari&s;e the rules which ought to govern in the application of this principle to the variety of ca&s;es in which the que&s;tion may ari&s;e: and he has him&s;elf noted that the practice in different &s;tates and in different courts, has been attended with great di|ver&s;ity. Indeed, admitting the right to abate intere&s;t under &s;pe|cial circum&s;tances, in ca&s;es in which it is the general rule to allow it, the circum&s;tances of each ca&s;e, are, perhaps, the only true criterion of the propriety of an exception. The particular nature of the contract, the circum&s;tances under which it was entered into, the relative &s;ituation of parties, the po&s;&s;ibility or not of mutual acce&s;s; the&s;e and other things would guide and vary the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cretion to abate. It was, there|fore, right to leave the commi&s;&s;ioners, as they are left, in the &s;ame &s;ituation with judges and juries:&mdash;to act according to the true equity of the &s;everal ca&s;es or of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered, that the government of Great Britain has to con&s;ult the intere&s;ts and opinions of its citizens, as well as the government of the United States tho&s;e of their citizens
<PB N="278" REF="028389_0277_0FD8BE9655AF8B50">The only &s;atisfactory cour&s;e which the former could pur&s;ue, in reference to its merchants, was to turn over the whole que&s;tion of intere&s;t as well as principal, to the commi&s;&s;ioners. And as this was truly equitable, the government of the United States could make no well-founded oppo&s;ition to it.</P>

<P>IT is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;eventh article of the treaty, to provide for two objects: one, compen&s;ation to our citizens for injuries to their property, by irregular, or illegal captures, or condemnations; the other, compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h citizens for captures of their property within the limits and juri&s;diction of the United States, or el&s;ewhere, by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports, <HI>in the ca&s;es in which the captured property having come within our po&s;ts and power, there was a neglect to make re&s;ti|tution.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t object is thus provided for;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1.

<ITEM>2. The amount of the lo&s;&s;es and damages to be compen&s;ated, is to be a&s;certained by five commi&s;&s;ioners, who are to be appointed in exactly the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e for liquidating the compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h cre|ditors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are to take a &s;imilar oath, and to exerci&s;e &s;imilar powers for the inve&s;tigation of claims with tho&s;e other commi&s;&s;ioners: and they are to decide according to the merits of the &s;everal ca&s;es, and to ju&s;tice, equity, and the laws of nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The &s;ame term of eighteen months is al|lowed for the reception of claims, with a like di&s;cretion to ex|tend the term, as in the ca&s;e of Briti&s;h debts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The award of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, or of three of them, under the like guards as in that ca&s;e, is to be final and conclu&s;ive, both as to the ju&s;tice of the claims, and to the amount of the com|pen&s;ation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And, la&s;tly, his Britannic maje&s;ty is to cau&s;e the compen&s;ation awarded, to be paid to the claimants in &s;pecie, without deduction, at &s;uch times and places, and upon the condition of &s;uch relea&s;es or a&s;&s;ignments, as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall pre&s;cribe.</ITEM>

Mutually and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately examined, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to be convinced, that this provi&s;ion is ample, and ought to be &s;atisfactory. The cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will exhibit various proofs of the di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of the clamours again&s;t it; but it will be pertinent to introduce here, one or two &s;amples of it.</P>
<P>It has been alleged, that while the article preceding, and this article, provide effectually for every demand of Great Britain again&s;t the United States, the provi&s;ion for this import|ant and urgent claim of ours is neither explicit nor efficient, nor co-exten&s;ive with the object, nor bears any proportion to the <HI>&s;ummary method,</HI> adopted for the &s;atisfying of Briti&s;h claims.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;tion is every way unfortunate. The plan for &s;ati&s;|fying our claim, except as to the de&s;cription of the &s;ubject which varies with it, is an exact copy of that for making com|pen&s;ation to Briti&s;h creditors. Whoever will take the pains to compare, will find, that in the leading points, literal conformi|ty is &s;tudied; and that in others, the provi&s;ions are a&s;&s;imilated by direct references; and will di&s;cover al&s;o, this important di&s;|tinction in favor of the efficiency and &s;ummarine&s;s of the pro|vi&s;ion for our claim&mdash;that while the commi&s;&s;ioners are expre&s;s|ly re&s;tricted from awarding payment to Briti&s;h creditors, to be made &s;ooner than one year after the exchange of ratifications of the treaty, they are free to award it to be made the very day of their deci&s;ion, for the &s;poliations of our property. As to compen&s;ation for Briti&s;h property, captured within our limits, or by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports and not re&s;tored, which is the only other Briti&s;h claim that has been provided for, it happens that this, forming a part of the very article we are con&s;idering, is &s;ubmitted to the identical mode of relief, which is in&s;tituted for making &s;atisfaction to us.</P>
<P>So far, then, is it from being true, that a compari&s;on of the modes of redre&s;s provided by the treaty, for the complaints of the re&s;pective parties, turns to our di&s;advantage, that the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e exhibits a &s;ub&s;tantial &s;imilitude, with only one material difference, and that in our favor; and, that a &s;trong argument for the equity of the provi&s;ions on each &s;ide, is to be drawn from their clo&s;e re&s;emblance of each other.</P>
<P>The other &s;ugge&s;tion alluded to, and which has been &s;hame|le&s;sly reiterated, is, that Denmark and Sweden, by pur&s;uing a more &s;pirited conduct, had obtained better terms than the United States. It is even pretended, that one or both of them had actually received from Great Britain a gro&s;s &s;um on ac|count&mdash; in anticipation of an ultimate liquidation.&mdash;In my &s;e|cond number, the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e
<PB N="280" REF="028389_0279_0FD8E9BE2F883A68">powers had obtained more than the United States, was inti|mated; but the &s;ub&s;equent repetition of the idea, more co|vertly in print, and very openly and confidently in conver&s;a|tion, renders expedient an explicit and peremptory denial of the fact. There never has appeared a particle of evidence to &s;upport it; and after challenging the a&s;&s;erters of it to produce their proof, I aver, that careful enquiry, at &s;ources of infor|mation, at lea&s;t as direct and authentic as theirs, has &s;atisfied me, that the &s;ugge&s;tion is wholly unfounded, and that at the time of the conclu&s;ion of our treaty with Great Britain, both Denmark and Sweden were behind us in the effect of their mea&s;ures for obtaining reparation.</P>
<P>What are we to think of attempts like the&s;e, to dupe and irritate the public mind? Will any prudent citizen &s;till con&s;ent to follow &s;uch blind or &s;uch treacherous guides?</P>
<P>Let us now, under the influence of a calm and candid tem|per, without which truth eludes our re&s;earches, by a clo&s;e &s;crutiny of the provi&s;ion, &s;atisfy our&s;elves, whether it be not really a rea&s;onable and proper one. But previous to this it is requi&s;ite to advert to a collateral mea&s;ure, which was al&s;o a fruit of the mi&s;&s;ion to Great Britain, and which ought to be taken in conjunction with the &s;tipulations of this article. I refer to the order of the Briti&s;h king in council, of the 6th of Augu&s;t, 1794, by which order, the door before &s;hut by lap&s;e of time, is opened to appeals from the Briti&s;h We&s;t India courts of admiralty, to be brought at any time which &s;hall be judged rea&s;onable by the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of appeals in prize cau&s;es. This, of it&s;elf, was no incon&s;iderable &s;tep towards the redre&s;s of our grievances; and it may be hoped, that with the aid which the government of the United States has given to faci|litate appeals, much relief may en&s;ue from this mea&s;ure. It will not be wonderful, if it &s;hould comport with the pride and policy of the Briti&s;h government, by promoting ju&s;tice in their courts, to leave as little as po&s;&s;ible to be done by the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>I proceed now to examine the characteri&s;tics of the &s;upple|mentary provi&s;ion made by the article, in connection with the objections to it.</P>
<P>It admits fully and explicitly the principle, that compen&s;a|tion is to be made for the lo&s;&s;es and damages &s;u&s;tained by our citizens, by irregular or illegal captures, or condemnations of their ve&s;&s;els and other property, under colour of authority (which includes governmental orders and in&s;tructions) or of commi&s;&s;ions of his Britannic maje&s;ty. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the cau&s;es of the lo&s;&s;es and damages are mentioned in the disjunctive, "captors or condemnations;" &s;o that damages by
<PB N="281" REF="028389_0280_0FD8E9C1CF41E240">captures, which were not followed by condemnations, are provided for as well as tho&s;e where condemnations did follow.</P>
<P>A cavil has been rai&s;ed on the meaning of the word, colour, which it is pretended, would not reach the ca&s;es de&s;igned to be embraced; becau&s;e the &s;poliations complained of, were made, not merely by <HI>colour,</HI> but actually by <HI>virtue</HI> of in&s;tructions from the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>For the very rea&s;on that this &s;ubtil and artificial meaning a&s;cribed to the term, would tend to defeat the manife&s;t ge|neral intent of the main provi&s;ion of the article, which is plainly to give reparation for irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of American property, contrary to the laws of nations&mdash;that meaning mu&s;t be deemed inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But in fact, the expre&s;&s;ion is the mo&s;t accurate that could have been u&s;ed, to &s;ignify the real intent of the article. When we &s;ay, a thing was done by colour of an authority or com|mi&s;&s;ion, we mean one of three things; that it was done on the pretence of a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> authority or commi&s;&s;ion <HI>not validly</HI> im|parted, or on the pretence of <HI>&s;uch</HI> an authority or commi&s;&s;ion <HI>validly</HI> imparted but <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> or <HI>mi&s;applied,</HI> or on the pretence of an <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> authority or commi&s;&s;ion, regularly, as to form, imparted and exerci&s;ed. It denotes a defect of rightful and ju&s;t authority, whether emanating from a wrong &s;ource, or impro|perly from a right &s;ource; whereas the phra&s;e "by virtue of," is mo&s;t properly applicable to the valid exerci&s;e of a valid authority. But the two phra&s;es are not unfrequently u&s;ed as &s;ynonimous. Thus, in a proclamation of the Briti&s;h king, of the 25th of May, 1792, he, among other things, forbids all his &s;ubjects, by <HI>virtue</HI> or under <HI>colour</HI> of any foreign commi&s;&s;ion or letters of repri&s;als, to di&s;turb, infe&s;t, or damage, the &s;ubjects of France.</P>
<P>In who&s;e mouths does the article put the expre&s;&s;ion? In tho&s;e of citizens of the United States? What mu&s;t they be pre&s;umed to have meant? Clearly this; that by colour of in|&s;tructions or commi&s;&s;ions of his Britannic maje&s;ty, either ex|erci&s;ed erroneou&s;ly, or i&s;&s;ued erroneou&s;ly, as being contrary to the laws of nations; the citizens of the United States had &s;uf|fered lo&s;s and damage by irregular or illegal captures or con|demnations of their property. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t is the &s;tandard appealed to, to decide the irregularity or illegality to be redre&s;&s;ed? Ex|pre&s;sly the laws of nations. The commi&s;&s;ioners are to decide "according to the merits of the &s;everal ca&s;es, to ju&s;tice, equi|ty, and the <HI>laws of nations.</HI>" Wherever the&s;e laws, as received and practi&s;ed among nations, pronounce a capture or condemna|tion of neutral property to have been irregular or illegal, though by colour of an authority or commi&s;&s;ion of his Britannic ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="282" REF="028389_0281_0FD8E9C356FF5440">it would be the duty of the commi&s;&s;ioners to award com|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The critici&s;m, however, fails on its own principle, when te&s;ted by the fact. The great &s;ource of grievance, intended to be redre&s;&s;ed by the article, proceeded from the in&s;truction of the 6th of November, 1793. That in&s;truction directs the com|manders of &s;hips of war and privateers, to &s;top and detain all &s;hips laden with goods, the produce of any colony belonging to France, or carrying provi&s;ions and other &s;upplies for the u&s;e of &s;uch colony, and to bring the &s;ame, with their cargoes, to <HI>legal adjudication</HI> in the Briti&s;h courts of admiralty. The&s;e terms, <HI>"legal adjudication,"</HI> were certainly not equivalent, upon any rational con&s;truction to <HI>condemnation.</HI> Adjudication means &s;im|ply, a judicial deci&s;ion, which might be either to acquit or con|demn. Yet the Briti&s;h We&s;t India courts of admiralty appear to have generally acted upon the term as &s;ynonimous with con|demnation. In doing this, they may be truly &s;aid, even in the &s;en&s;e of the objection, to have acted by colour, only, of the in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h cabinet have di&s;avowed this con&s;truction of the We&s;t India courts; and have as we have &s;een, by a &s;pecial act of interference, opened a door which was before &s;hut to a re|ver&s;al of their &s;entences, by appeal to the courts in England. We find, al&s;o, that the term adjudication is u&s;ed in the XVIIth article of our late treaty as &s;ynonimous, only with judicial deci&s;ion, according to its true import. This, if any thing were wanting, would render it impo&s;&s;ible for the commi&s;&s;ioners to refu&s;e redre&s;s on the ground of the condemnations, if other|wi&s;e illegal, being warranted by the pretended &s;en&s;e of the words legal adjudication. But in reality, as before ob&s;erved, their commi&s;&s;ion will be to award compen&s;ation in all ca&s;es, in which they are of opinion, that, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nations, captures or condemnations were irregular or illegal, however otherwi&s;e authorized; and this in contempt of the quibbling critici&s;m which has been &s;o cunningly devi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The provi&s;ion under con&s;ideration, obliges the Briti&s;h government, in all ca&s;es of illegal captures or condemnations, in which adequato compen&s;ation cannot, for whatever rea&s;on, be actually had in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, to make full and complete compen&s;ation to the claimants, which is to be paid in &s;pecie to them&s;elves, without deduction, at &s;uch times and places as &s;hall be awarded.</P>
<P>They are not &s;ent for redre&s;s to the captors, or obliged to take any circuitous cour&s;e for their payment, but are to receive it immediately from the trea&s;ury of Great Britain.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="283" REF="028389_0282_0FD8E9C58BF5D808">
3d, The amount of the compen&s;ation in each ca&s;e is to be &s;ixed by five commi&s;&s;ioners, two appointed by the United States, two by Great Britain: the fifth by the&s;e four, or in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement, by lot. the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners to meet and act in London.</P>
<P>It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, as has been ob&s;erved and &s;hown in the analogous ca&s;es, to imagine a plan for organizing a tribunal more completely equitable and impartial than this; while it is the exact counterpart of the one which is to decide on the claims of Briti&s;h creditors. Could it have been believed, that &s;o palpable an error could have been impo&s;ed on a town meet|ing, in the face of &s;o plain a provi&s;ion, as to induce it to charge again&s;t this article, that in a national concern of the United States, redre&s;s was left to Briti&s;h courts of admiralty? Yet, &s;trange as it may appear, this did happen even in the truly en|lightened town of Bo&s;ton. The ju&s;t pride of that town will not quickly forget, that it has been &s;o compromitted.</P>
<P>The truth is, that, according to the common u&s;age of na|tions, the courts of admiralty of the belligerent parties are the channels through which the redre&s;s of injuries to neutrals is &s;ought. But Great Britain has been brought to agree to refer all the ca&s;es, in which ju&s;tice cannot be obtained through tho&s;e channels, to an extraordinary tribunal; in other words, to arbitrators mutually appointed.</P>
<P>It is here that we find the reparation of the national wrong which we had &s;uffered.&mdash;In admitting the principle of com|pen&s;ation by the government it&s;elf, in agreeing to an extraor|dinary tribunal, in the con&s;titution of which the parties have an equal voice, to liquidate that compen&s;ation, Great Britain has virtually and effectually acknowledged the injury which had been done to our neutral rights, and has con&s;ented to make &s;atisfaction for it. This was an apology in fact, however it may be in form.</P>
<P>As it regards our honor, this is an adequate, and the only &s;pecies u&s;ual in &s;imilar ca&s;es between nations; pecuniary com|pen&s;ation is the true reparation in &s;uch ca&s;es&mdash;governments are not apt to go upon their knees to a&s;k pardon of other govern|ments&mdash;Great Britain, in the recent in&s;tance of the di&s;pute with Spain about Nootka Sound, was glad to accept of a like reparation. It merits remark, incidentally, that the in&s;trument, which &s;ettles this di&s;pute, expre&s;sly waves, like our treaty, re|ference to the merits of the complaints and preten&s;ions of the re&s;pective parties. Is our &s;ituation &s;uch as to authori&s;e us to pre|tend to impo&s;e humiliating conditions on other nations!</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between injuries and in&s;ults, which we are too apt to confound. The &s;eizures and &s;polia|tions
<PB N="284" REF="028389_0283_0FD8E9D10D3A6DC8">of our property fall mo&s;t truly under the former head. The acts which produced them, embraced all the neutral pow|ers, were not particularly levelled at us, bore no mark of an intention to humble us by any peculiar indignity or outrage.</P>
<P>The&s;e acts were of June 8th, and of November 6th, 1793. The &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els going with provi&s;ions to the demi|nions of France, under the fir&s;t, was put on the double ground of a war extraordinary in its principle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though this country has viewed the principle of the war favorably, it is certain that Europe generally. the neutral powers not wholly excepted, has viewed it in a different light, &s;o that this was not a mere pretence.</NOTE> and of a con&s;truction of the laws of nations, which, it was &s;aid, permitted that &s;eizure; a con&s;truction not de&s;titute of colour, and apparently &s;upported by the authority of Vattel, though, in my opinion, ill founded. It was accompanied al&s;o by compen&s;ation for what was taken, and other circum&s;tances, that evinced a de&s;ire to &s;mooth the act. The indi&s;criminate con&s;i&s;cation of our pro|perty, upon the order of the 6th of November, which was the truly flagrant injury, was certainly unwarranted by that order (and no &s;ecret one has appeared)&mdash;and the matter has been &s;o explained by the Briti&s;h government. It is clear that evils &s;uffered under acts &s;o circum&s;tanced, are injuries rather than in&s;ults&mdash;and are &s;o much the more manageable as to the &s;pe|cies and mea&s;ure of redre&s;s. It would be Quixoti&s;m to a&s;&s;ert that we might not honorably accept in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the peca|niary reparation which has been &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>But it is alleged, in point of intere&s;t, it is un&s;atisfactory&mdash; tedious in the proce&s;s&mdash;uncertain in the event; that there ought to have been actual and immediate indemnifications, or at lea&s;t, a payment upon account.</P>
<P>A little calm reflection, will convince us, that neither of the two la&s;t things was to be expected. There was ab&s;olutely no criterion, either for a full indemnification, or for an advance upon account. The value of the property &s;eized and con|demned (lay out of the ca&s;e, damages upon captures where condemnation had not en&s;ued) was not a&s;certained, even to our own government, with any tolerable accuracy. Every well informed man will think it probable, that of this, a proportion was covered French property.&mdash;There were, there&s;ore, no ade|quate data, upon which our government could demand, or the Briti&s;h government pay, a determined &s;um.&mdash;Both governments mu&s;t have acted e&s;&s;entiall by gue&s;s. Ours could not in honor or con&s;cience have made even an e&s;timate but upon evidence. It might have happened, that a &s;um which appeared upon the evidence that had been collected, &s;ufficient, might have proved on further evidence in&s;ufficient. Too little, as well as too much,
<PB N="285" REF="028389_0284_0FD8E9D2544072C0">might have been demanded and paid. But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that &s;ome gro&s;s e&s;timate might have been formed; and that of this, &s;uch a part might have been advanced upon ac|count, as was within the narrowe&s;t probable limit, liable to eventual adju&s;tment. Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e this done&mdash; what good end would it have an&s;wered? How could the Unit|ed States have di&s;tributed this money among the &s;ufferers, till it was a&s;certained which of them was truly entitled, and to how much? Is it not evident, that if they had made any di&s;tri|bution, before the final and perfect inve&s;tigation of the right of each claimant, it would be at the ri&s;k of making mi&s;pay|ments, and of being obliged to replace the &s;ums mi&s;paid, per|haps at a lo&s;s to the United States, for the benefit of tho&s;e who &s;hould be found to be better entitled? Would it have been expedient for our government to have incurred this ri&s;k to its con&s;tituents? And if the money was to be held undi&s;tri|buted till an inve&s;tigation of claims was completed, to what purpo&s;e the ha&s;te about an advance?</P>
<P>On the other hand&mdash;Is it in this loo&s;e, gro&s;s way, that na|tions tran&s;act affairs, with each other? Do even individuals make indemnifications to one another, in &s;o lumping a man|ner? Could it be expected of Great Britain, that &s;he would pay, till it was fairly a&s;certained what was to be paid; e&s;peci|ally when &s;he had too much cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that a material proportion of the property claimed, might turn out to be French? Would it have been ju&s;tifiable on our part, to make her compliance with &s;uch a demand, the <HI>&s;ine quo non</HI> of ac|commodation and peace? Whoever will believe that &s;he would have complied with &s;o humiliating a requi&s;ition, mu&s;t be per|&s;uaded that we were in a condition to dictate, and &s;he in a condition to be obliged to receive any terms that we might think fit to pre&s;cribe? The per&s;on who can believe this, mu&s;t be, in my opinion, under the influence of a defirium, for which there is no cure in the re&s;ources of rea&s;on and argu|ment.</P>
<P>If it mu&s;t be admitted, that it was matter of nece&s;&s;ity, that inve&s;tigation &s;hould precede payment; then I &s;ee not what more &s;ummary mode could have been devi&s;ed. Who more capable of proceeding with di&s;patch, that arbitrators untram|melled with legal forms; ve&s;ted with powers to examine par|ties and others, on oath, and to command and receive all evi|dence in their own way? Here are all the means of expedi|tion dive&s;ted of every clog.</P>
<P>Eighteen months are allowed for preferring claims, but the commi&s;&s;ioners are at liberty to adju&s;t them as fa&s;t as they are preferred.&mdash;In every ca&s;e in which it appears to them <HI>bona fide,</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="028389_0285_0FD8E9D9D0F752A0">that the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is inadequate to relief, they may forthwith proceed to examine and decide. There is no impediment, no cau&s;e of delay whatever, more than the na|ture of a due inve&s;tigation always requires.</P>
<P>The meeting of the commi&s;&s;ioners at London, was recom|mended by the circum&s;tance that the admiralty courts were likely to concentre there a con&s;iderable part of the evidence, on which they were to proceed; which upon the whole, might favor di&s;patch, as well as more complete ju&s;tice. In many ca&s;es, the deci&s;ions of tho&s;e courts may come under their review.</P>
<P>As to the uncertainty of the event, this, as far as it may be true, was in&s;eparable from any plan, bottomed on the idea of a previous inve&s;tigation of claims: and it has been &s;hown, that &s;ome &s;uch plan was rea&s;onable and inetitable.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be added, that the plan affords a moral certain|ty of &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice, which is all that can rationally be expected in &s;imilar affairs; compen&s;ation, where due, is ex|plicitly &s;tipulated. A fair and edequate mode of deciding and liquidating it has been &s;ettled. All the arguments which were adduced to prove the probability of good &s;aith, in regard to the po&s;ts, apply equally to this &s;ubject. The intere&s;t which every nation has in the pre&s;ervation of character, and which the mo&s;t profligate dare not entirely di&s;regard&mdash;the con&s;ideration of de|feating the fulfilment of the &s;tipulations on our part&mdash;the &s;ize of the object, certainly not of great magnitude&mdash;the very di&s;|couraging &s;ituation for replunging &s;uddenly into a new war, in which the pre&s;ent war will in every event leave Great Britain. The&s;e are rea&s;ons which afford &s;olid ground of a&s;&s;urances that there will be no eva&s;ion of performance.</P>
<P>As to the commi&s;&s;ioners, two of the five will be of our choice, a third may be &s;o likewi&s;e; but &s;hould it prove other|wi&s;e, it will be &s;urpri&s;ing if one of the other three, all acting under oath, and having character at &s;take, &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to do us rea&s;onable ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3d, While their power is co-exten&s;ive with <HI>all</HI> lo&s;&s;es and da|mage; from irregular <HI>or</HI> allegal captures <HI>or</HI> condemnations, their &s;entence in each ca&s;e is to be conclu&s;ive, and the rules which are to govern it as pre&s;cribed by the article, are the merits of each ca&s;e, ju&s;tice, equity and the law of nations. What greater latitude could have been de&s;ired to be given? What greater latitude could have been given? What el&s;e in the ca&s;e was there to have been provided for? What is meant by the a&s;&s;ertion, that the provi&s;ion is not commen&s;urate with the object?</P>
<P>The general and unqualified reference to the laws of nations, di&s;mi&s;&s;es all pretence to &s;ub&s;titute the arditrary regulations of
<PB N="287" REF="028389_0286_0FD8E9DB581AE9E8">Great Britain as rules of deci&s;ion. Her in&s;tructions or orders, if incompatible with tho&s;e laws, are nullities.</P>
<P>Thus the treaty unfetters the que&s;tion between us and her, from the commencement of the war, and with her own con|&s;ent, commits them at large to a tribunal to be con&s;tituted by mutual choice.</P>
<P>Will any man of candour and equity &s;ay, that a better pro|vi&s;ion ought to have been expected than has been accompli&s;hed?</P>
<P>The alternative was immediate indemnification, by actual payment in whole or in part, without examination of the ex|tent or ju&s;tice of claims; or &s;uture indemnification, after a due inve&s;tigation of both in &s;ome equitable and effectual mode. The fir&s;t was attended with di&s;&s;iculties on our &s;ide, and with &s;olid objections on the other &s;ide. The la&s;t was therefore the truly rea&s;onable cour&s;e, and it has been pur&s;ued on a very pro|per plan.&mdash;The cau&s;es of lo&s;s and damage are fully embraced. They are referred to the deci&s;ion of an unexceptionable tribu|nal, to be guided by unexceptionable rules, and the indemnifi|cation which may be awarded, is to be paid fully, immediately, and without <HI>de tour</HI> by the Briti&s;h government it&s;elf. Say ye im|partial and enlightened, if all this be not as it ought to have been!</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>[CONTINUED FROM VOL. 1. PAGE 252.]</P>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE numerous faults of the 6th article compel me re|luctantly to make it the &s;ubject of another number; and the rather, as we &s;hall thereby anticipate &s;imilar objections, which we &s;hould otherwi&s;e be obliged to notice in &s;everal. The appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners without the concurrence of con|gre&s;s &mdash;the a&s;certaining their &s;alaries by treaty&mdash;their a&s;&s;umption of a juri&s;diction over matters ari&s;ing <HI>under treaties and ca&s;es in which the United States are parties,</HI> in derogation of the rights of the &s;upreme court, having been &s;hown to violate the con&s;ti|tution&mdash;it will, I believe, be readily admitted, that no power exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, to appropriate money to the payment of Briti&s;h debts, unle&s;s with the concurrence of con|gre&s;s; and that the treaty, therefore, is uncon&s;titutional, ina&s;|much as it pledges them ab&s;olutely to do an, act which they may or may not do at their di&s;cretion. Whether in the exerci&s;e of this di&s;cretion, they could con&s;titutionally, agree to this article? or whether if they could, it would be ju&s;t or politic? are que&s;tions that remain to be examined. The right of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners with judiciary powers, has already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The right of <HI>congre&s;s</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h officers by law, is al&s;o limited. 1&s;t, To the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. 2d, To the courts of law. 3d, To the heads of departments. 4th, To the pre&s;ident alone. No power a ve&s;ted in them to allow the appointment of any officer by <HI>lot,</HI> and much le&s;s to admit that his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hould exerci&s;e the right of appointing judges for the trial of cau&s;es in which they are them&s;elves to be the parties. 2. No power exi&s;ts in congre&s;s, to take from the &s;upreme court the right to determine <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es ari&s;ing <HI>under treaties&mdash;all</HI> ca&s;es in which the United States are parties. The determination of the&s;e ca&s;es is not le&s;s <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> the right of the judiciary, than the making of laws exclu&s;ively of congre&s;s. 3. In examining the&s;e powers, I find none that enables them to change the rules of evidence&mdash;to alter the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the country, or to authorize courts &s;o to do. The&s;e rights, therefore, not being given to congre&s;s, I pre&s;ume are exclu|&s;ively inve&s;ted in the &s;tate legi&s;latures; and, of cour&s;e, I am
<PB N="4" REF="028389_0291_0FD8E9EAC62D8EE8">led to doubt the right that congre&s;s them&s;elves have, to empower any five men, to examine the <HI>plaintiff</HI> on oath, and to receive in evidence, written depo&s;itions, papers, <HI>copies,</HI> or <HI>extracts,</HI> authenticated <HI>in any &s;uch way</HI> "as the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to require or allow." A right &s;o exten&s;ive, &s;o liable to abu&s;e, particularly when accompanied with the power to decide finally and arbitrarily, &s;hould, I think, be tolerated in no free &s;tare.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice or policy of the a&s;&s;umption of the debts of indi|viduals, by the United States, mu&s;t be determined by a refer|ence to the treaty of Paris, and the &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures of the United States. By the 5th article of that treaty, it was agreed, "That creditors on <HI>either fide</HI> &s;hall meet with no <HI>lawful</HI> impe|diment to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted." It is ob&s;ervable, that this article gives the creditors on neither &s;ide any claim upon the &s;tates, but leaves them to pro&s;ecute the individual, and the ordinary courts of law to determine their rights. In con&s;equence of which, &s;ome debtors have di&s;charged all that was due; others have been more negligent.</P>
<P>Upon what principle can the Briti&s;h creditor charge the com|munity, with debts due from delinquent individuals? It is &s;aid, that laws were pa&s;&s;ed to re&s;train the payment of debts for a cer|tain period&mdash;yet whoever will turn to Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Mr. Hammond on this &s;ubject, will find, that the&s;e laws in <HI>no one in&s;tance</HI> have operated to the prejudice of the Briti&s;h credi|tor; that the right of congre&s;s to make treaties, under the old confederation, being unlimited, the &s;tate courts always con&s;trued the treaty as a law which over-ruled &s;tate laws&mdash;&s;o that the Bri|ti&s;h creditor has had the full effect of the treaty. Mr. Jeffer&s;on's rea&s;oning was &s;o conclu&s;ive on this head, that Mr. Hammond, notwith&s;tanding his rage for writing and the able aid he had at Philadelphia, did not pretend to an&s;wer his arguments; but, after &s;ome delay, evaded them by &s;aying that he had &s;ent his letters to England. Lord Grenville al&s;o (as appears by Mr. Pinckney's letters) was &s;o &s;truck with the force of his rea&s;oning, that in&s;tead of an&s;wering it, he commends it in the highe&s;t terms; nor did it ever meet with a reply, until Camillus took up the gauntlet as the Briti&s;h champion.&mdash;It is true, indeed, that his arguments on this &s;ubject, partake &s;o much of the quibbles of the bar, are &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tile of rea&s;on|ing adopted by &s;tate&s;men, that, probably, Lord Grenville di&s;|dained to u&s;e them&mdash;With all his ingenuity, he has not, how|ever, adduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a Briti&s;h creditor's being ob&s;tructed by our courts in the recovery of his debts. But, admitting that
<PB N="5" REF="028389_0292_0FD8E9EBDB858840">there had been temporary ob&s;tructions ari&s;ing, either from the &s;ituation of the country or the breach of treaty on the part of Britain, all that &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k, was, that the&s;e ob&s;truc|tions &s;hould be removed. Now it is admitted that this has been done for more than &s;ix years pa&s;t; &s;o that the Briti&s;h creditor, from that period, at lea&s;t, has had the full effect of the treaty. Upon what pretence, then, mu&s;t the United States &s;tep in be|tween him and his debtor? Why mu&s;t the farmer and mecha|nic be charged with the debt of the merchant, and &s;tates that owe nothing, that never have made laws of the nature com|plained of, pay the debts of tho&s;e that owe much?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing (contrary to the mo&s;t obvious principles of rea|&s;on and ju&s;tice that the United States &s;hould be liable to the Briti&s;h creditors; &s;urely it would have been &s;ufficient to place them in the &s;ituation of the debtor, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the rules of law which prevailed in the &s;tate where the debt was contracted; the&s;e are known to be various in the different &s;tates&mdash;in &s;ome, for in&s;tance, land and &s;laves are not liable to be &s;old in fee, for debts, nor were &s;o when the debt was con|tracted; in &s;uch &s;tates the debtor being dead, &amp;c. it will be very difficult to get at the property in the hands of the heir. In others, &s;uch a&s;&s;ignments and conveyances may have been made, as to put the recovery out of the creditor's power&mdash;In others, laws, limiting the time for the recovery of debts to a &s;hort pe|riod may have barred the demand. All the&s;e are ri&s;ks the credi|tor knew-he was to run, when he made his contracts.&mdash;The United States, who were no party to this contract, can cer|tainly not be bound to &s;ecure the <HI>Briti&s;h creditor</HI> again&s;t them, while it leaves them to operate again&s;t their own citizens. But, what is &s;till wor&s;e, even the rules of law, both in the deci&s;ion and in the admi&s;&s;ion of evidence, are to be relaxed in favor of Briti&s;h creditors. What circum&s;tance, either in the treaty or in rea&s;on, can convert all the&s;e common law cau&s;es into proper &s;ubjects for courts of equity? What &s;hall carry them even be|yond the rules e&s;tabli&s;hed in courts of equity, which, like courts of law, are bound by certain known principles&mdash;while the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are to determine, agreeably to their own (perhaps wild and undeterminate) ideas of <HI>equity and ju&s;tice?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of equity, for in&s;tance, would not permit the compla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch to influence the que&s;tion; yet the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w|ered to examine "<HI>all per&s;ons</HI> that &s;hall come before them on oath," nor will <HI>any</HI> courts admit of <HI>extracts</HI> as evidence; yet &s;o &s;olicitous has Mr. Jay been to &s;well the amount of Briti&s;h debts, and to increa&s;e the public debt, that every thing, <HI>copies, papers, depo&s;itions, books, extracts,</HI> are to be admitted in evidence.&mdash;It
<PB N="6" REF="028389_0293_0FD8E9ED52FEA008">is very extraordinary, that when we complain of an immen&s;e lo&s;s of property, by the depredations committed upon our trade, <HI>by order</HI> of the Briti&s;h goverment, and which, of cour&s;e, they are bound to compen&s;ate&mdash;that Mr. Jay's treaty &s;ends us fir&s;t to their courts of admiralty to determine the que&s;tions of right, which courts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily determine agreeably to the &s;pirit of the very in&s;tructions we complain of, nor in any ca&s;e apply to his commi&s;&s;ioners till &s;uch admiralty co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts have decid|ed upon it. The Americans mu&s;t go through all the delays, and &s;u&s;tain all the expen&s;e of &s;uits in Briti&s;h courts, to obtain re|dre&s;s for loffes which the Briti&s;h government has occa&s;ioned, while the Briti&s;h creditor is to charge the United States with debts which <HI>they do not owe,</HI> without the expen&s;e of a &s;uit in any court, and under the advantages of having all the forms of law relaxed in his favor.&mdash;This is certainly a new &s;pecies of re|ciprocity, which nothing but the inventive genius of Mr. Jay, &s;harpened by the warme&s;t attachment to Britain, could have di&s;covered. It is a little extraordinary, too, that when this ar|ticle was under con&s;ideration, Mr. Jay &s;hould not have reflect|ed, that the 4th article of the treaty of Paris was <HI>mutual,</HI> that it related to debts of <HI>either &s;ide;</HI> yet Mr. Jay has made no &s;ti|pulation for the payment of debts due <HI>to us</HI> from Briti&s;h cre|ditors.</P>
<P>It is true, that they have pa&s;&s;ed no laws to ob&s;truct the re|covery of them. But it is al&s;o true, that without &s;uch laws their courts of equity have undertaken to prevent their being recovered. And I need only appeal to the trea&s;urer of this &s;tate (New York) to &s;how the amount that has been paid in di&s;|charge of debts due from per&s;ons who&s;e e&s;tates have been for|feited, and which &s;uch per&s;ons were liable to pay to their cre|ditors: and that, too, in many ca&s;es in which &s;uits had actu|ally been brought in England, and the cau&s;es &s;topped by their courts. If my memory, &s;erves me, affidavits to this purpo&s;e, from re&s;pectable merchants of New York, will be found on the files of our hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly. It cannot be denied, that where the &s;tate has di&s;charged &s;uch debts, they are creditors to the amount, and that under the expre&s;s words of the treaty of Paris, they have a right to recover. Yet Mr. Jay has care|fully excluded them from the benefit of this article; &s;ince he well knew, that the amount of debts due from Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to the &s;tates and to individuals, exceeded the demands of Bri|ti&s;h creditors. Is any &s;o blind as not to &s;ee in this article a con|tinuation of that &s;y&s;tem which forms the &s;trength of govern|ment upon the mo&s;t corrupt principles? A public debt is thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep the government together; as if go|vernment
<PB N="7" REF="028389_0294_0FD8E9EECC97B970">wanted any &s;trength but that which &s;he derived from the &s;en&s;e the people had of the advantages they derived from it.&mdash;New debts are, therefore, to be created under every po&s;|&s;ible pretence. New debts will occa&s;ion new taxes&mdash;new taxes new officers&mdash;and new officers new &s;upporters of the govern|ment, at the expen&s;e of the yeomanry of the country; for it is ob&s;ervable, that the public creditors, bank holders, &amp;c. pay no taxes; tho&s;e burdens are all borne by tho&s;e who maintain their &s;tate, and nothing is left for the&s;e lordlings to do, but to watch over the &s;afety of government, and &s;ing ho&s;annas to the highe&s;t. It was nece&s;&s;ary to dry up the re&s;ources of the coun|try, le&s;t the irritation occa&s;ioned by Briti&s;h in&s;olence, and the confirmation of them by treaty, &s;hould at length rou&s;e the &s;pi|rit of the people; le&s;t, being too rich, they &s;hould revolt again&s;t that virtuous &s;upporter of our government, the Briti&s;h nation!</P>
<P>It was fore&s;een, too, as Camillus acknowledges, that clamours would be excited by the treaty. The Briti&s;h party might be too weak to &s;ilence them. It was a refined &s;troke of policy to &s;trengthen their hands by the addition of &s;uch merchants as had un&s;ettled accounts in Britain. The a&s;&s;umption of the&s;e debts by the general government, like the a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts, cannot fail to make many partizans; nothing can be more convenient for the merchant, than that the farmer, the &s;hopkeeper, the mechanic, the landholder, &s;hould di&s;charge the debts he owes, while he is tearing them to pieces for the principal, intere&s;t, and profit upon that very capital which the &s;tate a&s;&s;umes. It may be &s;aid that this may be recovered again&s;t him by the &s;tate: but every body knows how negligent public bodies are in the recovery of debts&mdash;how impo&s;&s;ible it will be for them to arrange all the little items of evidence on which the creditor recovers before the commi&s;&s;ioners, e&s;pecially where he is not con&s;ined to &s;trict legal proof. And at all events, what advantages will not the debtor derive from many years delay? Can we wonder that &s;ome merchants are found in our cities to advocate a treaty, which enables them to ride on the necks of their fellow citizens! &s;hould we not rather be &s;urpri&s;ed (when the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are deducted) to find that number &s;o very &s;mall? is it not at once a proof of their virtue, and the egregi|ous vices of the treaty?</P>

<P>THE &s;eventh article is &s;ubject, in a con&s;titutional view, to all the objections which have been noticed in the 6th. Nothing, therefore, remains but to examine its political cha|racter. The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes us, is its &s;tudied ob&s;curity, and the extreme &s;olicitude of the parties to render Mr. Je&s;&s;er&s;on obnoxious to the cen&s;ure it might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to draw after it, by appearing to make it originate in his letter to Mr. Hammond, written at the moment when the irritation occa&s;ioned by the controver&s;y with Mr. Genet was highe&s;t, and when it was doubtful whether a rupture with France would not have compelled us, according to the then favorite &s;y&s;tem, to throw our&s;elves into the arms of England. This letter, as was natural under the&s;e circum&s;tances, carries our conce&s;&s;ions to Britain, far beyond any thing which the laws of nations will warrant. The&s;e only require the re&s;torations of ve&s;&s;els taken in the ports or waters of the neutral nations <HI>if they can be recovered;</HI> every capture under &s;uch circum&s;tances being an in&s;ult to the nation within the juri&s;diction of whom &s;uch capture was made. They al&s;o con&s;ider it as an unfriendly act, voluntarily to &s;uffer the ve&s;&s;els of either party to arm them&s;elves again&s;t the other; and &s;hould any ve&s;&s;el which had been &s;o armed, enter their ports with prizes, it would be &s;trictly con&s;onant to the laws of nati|ons, to order &s;uch ve&s;&s;el to depart <HI>with her prize.</HI>&mdash;But no wri|ter that I have met with, gives the neutral nation a right to &s;eize a prize, taken on the high &s;eas, and to re&s;tore it to the original owner;&mdash;or much le&s;s, binds them to pay for the prizes &s;o taken, which never entered their ports, merely becau&s;e the ve&s;&s;el by which it had been captured, had privately, and without the con&s;ent or knowledge of the neutral government, armed in her ports. Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter declares the pre&s;ident's opinion to be, that as by <HI>treaty</HI> with three nations, we are bound to u&s;e all the <HI>means in our power,</HI> to re&s;tore ve&s;&s;els <HI>taken in our ports, waters; or &s;eas near our &s;hores;</HI> &s;o he thought the &s;ame protection &s;hould be extended to the ve&s;&s;els of Britain, though we had no &s;uch treaty with her&mdash;that if in any particular ca&s;e, we had forborn or &s;hould forbear, for political rea&s;ons, to u&s;e the means for the re&s;toring of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els, he <HI>then</HI> thought we &s;hould be bound to make compen&s;ation; but otherwi&s;e, where we had u&s;ed means, and tho&s;e means proved ineffectual, as we &s;hould not be bound to make re&s;toration to the <HI>nations with whom we had treaties</HI>&mdash;he gave <HI>no opinion,</HI> that it ought to be done to Great Britain; that the &s;ame principle &s;hould be ex|tended, even to captures made on the high &s;eas, by ve&s;&s;els armed
<PB N="9" REF="028389_0296_0FD8E9F6E22E9088">in our ports, <HI>provided the prizes were brought into our ports.</HI> He concludes, as the re&s;ult of the&s;e &s;entiments, "And hence, you &s;ee, &s;ir, that the pre&s;ident contemplates re&s;titution or compen|&s;ation in ca&s;es <HI>before</HI> the 7th of Augu&s;t [1793] and after that date, re&s;titution, if it <HI>can be effected</HI> by any means in our pow|er." From this it appears, that though the pre&s;ident's opinion was declared as to &s;ome ca&s;es, yet that as to others he gave <HI>no opinion.</HI> If, then, the article had referred, as &s;ome have con|tended, to the letter, for a definition of the ca&s;es in which compen&s;ation was to be made, it would be wholly indefinite, and it mu&s;t have been left to the di&s;cretion of the commi&s;&s;ion|ers, a majority of whom may be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, to declare the ca&s;es in which the United States &s;hall be liable. As it was, however, po&s;&s;ible that a majority of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, had the que&s;tion been left to be con&s;trued by Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter, would not have extended it to the length Lord Grenville wi&s;hed, this di&s;cretion was taken from them; and the ca&s;es, in which the United States &s;hould be liable, carried not only far beyond what the pre&s;ident had declared to be his opinion, to wit, "The ca&s;e of prizes taken in our waters, which we had u&s;ed <HI>no</HI> means to have re&s;tored, and prizes taken upon the high &s;eas, by ve&s;|&s;els armed in our ports, <HI>if brought into our horbours.</HI>" The treaty renders us liable, in every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, whether it was or was not in our power to re&s;tore the prize; whether it was taken upon the high &s;eas, and &s;ailed to our own or foreign ports. Nor is the letter referred to in any part of the article, in order to define the ca&s;e intended by the article, but merely (if it had any other object than that I have mentioned) to prevent a &s;econd inve&s;tigation of the que&s;tion, where the engagements contained in the letter had been already fulfilled. This will appear from the preamble, which is always con&s;idered as a key to the article. "And whereas certain merchants and others, his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, complain, that in the cour&s;e of the war they have &s;u&s;tained lo&s;s and damage by rea&s;on of the captures of the ve&s;|&s;els and merchandize, taken within the limits and juri&s;diction of the United States, and brought into the ports of the &s;ame, <HI>or taken by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in ports of the United States;</HI> it is agreed that in <HI>all &s;uch ca&s;es,</HI> where re&s;titution &s;hall not have been made, agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, &amp;c. the complaints of the parties &s;hall be referred to the commi&s;&s;ioners," &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that there is not one word in the article, that confines the judgment of the commi&s;&s;ioners to ca&s;es in which we either connived at the capture, or u&s;ed no means to re&s;tore the prize; nor to the ca&s;e of prizes, which, after hav|ing
<PB N="10" REF="028389_0297_0FD8E9F7F7CFE338">been captured on the high &s;eas, came into our ports; but extends the provi&s;ion to <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> of ve&s;&s;els taken in our waters, provided they ever entered into our ports, notwith&s;tanding our having been unable to recover them; or wherever taken, if by ve&s;&s;els armed in our harbours, whether they came into our ports or not. The article contains a complete and ample definition of the ca&s;es intended, &s;o that the mention of the letter cannot be de&s;igned, in any &s;ort, to limit the &s;en&s;e; it does not even &s;ay that re&s;titution <HI>&s;hall be made</HI> agreeably to the tenor of the let|ter, but "but where re&s;toration has not been already made agreeably to the tenor of the letter," then, in <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> of cap|tures, as de&s;cribed in the preamble, the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall de|termine the amount, and the United States &s;hall pay. The re|ference to the letter was to an&s;wer the double purpo&s;e&mdash;fir&s;t, of rendering the writer odious, who, Camillus tells us, was Mr. Jay's rival in his further pur&s;uit of power, and to preclude the captors, who&s;e prizes had been taken from them agreeably to the tenor of the letter, from a &s;econd hearing before the com|mi&s;&s;ioners. Thus, then, Mr. Jay has, without any warrant from his own government, without any equivalent from the Briti&s;h, without any ju&s;tification drawn from the law of na|tions, mortgaged the United States for uncertain and immea|&s;urable &s;ums. It was not enough, it &s;eems, to relinqui&s;h our well founded claim, for compen&s;ation for the detention of our po&s;ts&mdash;the lo&s;s of our fur trade&mdash;the property carried off. It was not enough to charge the yeomanry of the country with the debts of the merchants; but, in addition to this, we mu&s;t pay a very con&s;iderable part of the havoc that has been made by French privateers on Briti&s;h property, and this, too, without any real or pretended equivalent, and while our trade was &s;uf|fering under Briti&s;h depredations. One would really &s;uppo&s;e that the trea&s;ures of the United States were inexhau&s;tible; that the art of government con&s;i&s;ted not in relieving the burdens of the people, but in adding to their load, that they might crouch the more before their lordly ma&s;ters; that in&s;tead of &s;eeking for the &s;upport of government by convincing the people of its influence on their happine&s;s, the object was to work upon our fears only&mdash;to a&s;&s;emble a cho&s;en corps of &s;tock jobbers about &mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid the throne&mdash;to make new debts, in order to acquire new recruits to this valuable band&mdash;to impo&s;e new taxes, that the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations occa&s;ioned thereby, may afford a pretence to armed &s;upporters of government to exert their benign influence&mdash;to &s;trengthen the&s;e by innumerable officers, by boards of commi&s;&s;ioners (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;s than thirteen of which are provided for by this treaty, by mini&s;ters extraordinary, to put

<P>N. B. As the &s;pace allotted for this paper will not admit of my entering upon a new article, I will indulge my&s;elf in a &s;hort note, in order to ob&s;erve, that Camillus having done me the honor to notice &s;ome of my remarks, it will give me peculiar plea&s;ure, when I can do it without breaking in upon the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervations on the treaty, to addre&s;s my|&s;elf to him in reply to his. For the pre&s;ent I confine my&s;elf to reque&s;t, that his readers and mine will &s;u&s;pend their judg|ment of it, until an inve&s;tigation of his law and his facts &s;hall enable them to judge of both with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion. Genius is with difficulty retained within the limits of either; and as a &s;pecimen of the boldne&s;s with which it &s;ometimes over|leaps both, I will only refer back to one of his late papers. In &s;peaking of the Indian trade, he a&s;&s;erts, that &s;even-eighths of their trade, exclu&s;ive of the Hud&s;on Bay territories, is drawn from the north &s;ide of the lakes; the po&s;ition I maintain, is directly the rever&s;e. As neither of us will probably think it delicate to balance the te&s;timony we have received from in|dividuals, we mu&s;t recur to other data, to confirm or refute our re&s;pective a&s;&s;ertions. Tho&s;e I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume, are &s;o con&s;onant to known and e&s;tabli&s;hed facts, that I think I may rely upon Camillus's candour to admit them. My fir&s;t po&s;ition is, that &s;avage nations hunt chiefly for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and to procure ne|ce&s;&s;aries which they cannot do without; that the proportion of this which each enjoys is much the &s;ame in the re&s;pective tribes on either &s;ide of the lakes; that, therefore, where the greate&s;t number of &s;avages live by the cha&s;e, the greate&s;t quantity of furs and peltry will be collected, with this difference, that the Indians that are neare&s;t the market, will be mo&s;t careful of tho&s;e they collect; will wear finer, and exchange more; they will al&s;o have a greater ta&s;te for luxuries, which will &s;timulate their indu&s;try and increa&s;e their ardour for the cha&s;e; that the bleak regions on the north &s;ide of the lake are more thinly in|habited than tho&s;e on the &s;outh, where not only the difference of latitude, but the effect of the large bodies of waters in &s;oft|ening the north-we&s;t winds, renders the climate much milder, and better fitted for the habitation of tho&s;e who live a &s;avage
<PB N="12" REF="028389_0299_0FD8E9FAE09AD128">life. The great trading &s;tations are, therefore, all on the <HI>&s;outh &s;ide</HI> of the lakes.</P>
<P>But let us, for the pre&s;ent, wave all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which are &s;o well known to operate upon the relative proportion of &s;avages to the territory they inhabit; and let us take the <HI>ex|tent</HI> of territory as in part the rule by which to determine the number of inhabitants; it will even then be found, that the trad|ing country of the United States is near four times larger than that of Canada, exclu&s;ive of the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company. Camillus profe&s;&s;es to be ignorant of the extent of their boundary, which, I mu&s;t own, &s;urpri&s;es me; &s;ince he a&s;&s;ures us, that he has made the fur trade an object of enquiry for years back; and more particularly as it appears, from the whole cour&s;e of his writing, that he can command any materi|als in the power of Mr. Jay. It is hardly conceivable, that this gentleman, when treating on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e limits in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where every document of this kind could be in&s;tantly ac|quired, would have been &s;o extremely negligent, as not to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the &s;ettlement by the commi&s;&s;ioners, after the treaty of Utrecht, and the &s;till more extended claim of the company, to which, without doubt, the utmo&s;t latitude will <HI>now</HI> be allowed. The &s;outhern boundary of the Hud&s;on Bay company, as &s;ettled by commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ub&s;equent to the treaty of Utrecht, is the forty-ninth degree of north latitude, in the whole extent, till it meets with the head of Moo&s;e river, which brings it one third of a degree more &s;outh, thence it runs a north-ea&s;t cour&s;e, nearly parallel with the St. Lawrence river, along the heights that divide the waters which fall into Hud|&s;on's Bay, from tho&s;e that run into the St. Lawrence. This line runs within twenty miles of the north &s;ide of the lake of the Woods; &s;uppo&s;ing, as the late&s;t geographers do, that lake to lie in forty-eight degrees and forty minutes north latitude. If, therefore, a line run from that lake due we&s;t, &s;hould inter&s;ect the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, or if not, till it inter&s;ects a line drawn from the head of that river, due north, till in meets the we&s;t line &s;o drawn from the lake of the Woods, which mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, be our boundary, it will only leave a &s;trip of country of le&s;s than 30 miles in extent, to the north; nor will it be much broader on the north of lake Superior. To the we&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the Briti&s;h have no claim. Should the lake of the Woods lie one half a degree higher, which is very probable, if we judge from mo&s;t maps of that country, our line will overtop that of the Hud&s;on Bay company. But whether it does or not, the only Indian territory on the north &s;ide of the lakes, of the lea&s;t con&s;equence, is the &s;pace &s;urrounded by the lakes, and bounded
<PB N="13" REF="028389_0300_0FD8EA02D9BF56D0">on the ea&s;t by the Ottawa river, which empties it&s;elf at Mon|treal. The country ea&s;t of that, I pre&s;ume, cannot be frequented by our traders any more than the country ea&s;t of the Hud&s;on: And by their deducting both the&s;e from our account, and placing the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi four degrees to the we&s;t of the lake of the Woods, the Briti&s;h Indian territory will be found (after de|ducting the great lake and &s;ettled country on both &s;ides) to be, to that of the United States, as 15 is to 55. As to any terri|tory to the we&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, I know of no ground whatever on which it can be claimed by the Briti&s;h; the we&s;t and north we&s;t coa&s;ts of America being actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Spain and Ru&s;&s;ia, who made the fir&s;t di&s;coveries there, and not by Britain) even if we &s;hould hold &s;o ab&s;urd a doctrine, as to &s;uppo&s;e that either one or the other could give a title to that great inland territory. After this &s;tatement of facts, if we take into con&s;i|deration the infinitely greater population of the &s;outhern than the northern nations, it will not, I believe, be deemed extrava|gant to a&s;&s;ert, that the Indian trade on our territory is ten times greater than that on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes. How greatly, then, mu&s;t. Camillus have been deceived, even though he has been for years pa&s;t, as he tells us, collecting information on this &s;ubject? How &s;u&s;picious &s;hould it render him and his readers, when he makes a&s;&s;ertions relative to matters with which he has taken le&s;s time to make him&s;elf acquainted? The limits of this paper will not permit me to travel from his <HI>facts</HI> to his <HI>law,</HI> or to compliment him upon the ingenuity with which he makes a judgment, in the reign of Elizabeth, a com|mentary upon an act which pa&s;&s;ed in that of Charles the Se|cond, half a century afterwards. It would, perhaps, have been more in point, to have &s;hown any one deci&s;ion of Lord Coke, in which a bare implication was &s;aid to over-rule an expre&s;s &s;tatute. But an extraordinary defence requires as extraordinary means of defence. As I greatly re&s;pect the talents of Camillus, I cannot but with &s;ympathy enter into his feelings, when this ra&s;h undertaking compels him to &s;in again&s;t his better judgment,</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE PHILADELPHIA GAZETTE. No. I. An Examination of the pending Treaty with Great Britain.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Pre&s;ident of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great happine&s;s, which re&s;ults from free government, it remains to be regretted by the temperate friends of liberty, that party-&s;pirit and party-mea&s;ures are <HI>"con&s;equential ills which freedom draws."</HI> The people of the United States, enjoying in their &s;ocial connection, an unequalled portion of <HI>the natural rights of individuals,</HI> have been from that cau&s;e, peculiarly &s;ubjected to the operations of party-cau&s;es and party-&s;prings. Local circum&s;tances, inaccurately appreciated, have contributed to increa&s;e the evil; and the accidentally une|qual cour&s;e of &s;ome of the fir&s;t advantages, which re&s;ulted from our re-union and reform in 1789, had a &s;trong, though tempo|rary, effect upon large portions of the people, di&s;po&s;ing them to &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, and fears.</P>
<P>At a time, when the United States were under the&s;e circum|&s;tances and impre&s;&s;ions, an unexampled conflict aro&s;e in the old world. Though our remote &s;ituation has &s;aved us from being inveloped in the devouring flame, even the broad Atlantic has not interpo&s;ed a &s;ufficient di&s;tance to &s;creen us from the wide and mighty fire, with which Europe is con&s;umed: and upon this occa&s;ion the zealous agents of more than one nation have been led, by their pa&s;&s;ions and our own, into more than ordi|nary operations upon our private opinions and our public councils.</P>
<P>It has been happy for this country, &s;ir, that the influence of the&s;e cau&s;es has not been extended to your mind. It is a mo&s;t comfortable reflection to con&s;iderate men of all parties, that you have been actuated by a &s;incere de&s;ire of <HI>common good</HI> in our dome&s;tic operations, and by impartial views in our foreign relations and concerns.</P>
<P>It is hoped, that the freedom of the&s;e preliminary remarks will not give offence to any of our fellow citizens. They are made &s;olely from a conviction, that in our free government it is an object of primary importance to be aware of exi&s;ting
<PB N="15" REF="028389_0302_0FD8EA055C65AB28">cau&s;es of prejudice and heat at the moment of intere&s;ting di&s;|cu&s;tions. It is hoped, &s;ir, that the&s;e prefatory ob&s;ervations will appear to be pertinent, as they regard your pre&s;ent delicate and important relation to the &s;ubject, which it is propo&s;ed to exa|mine&mdash;a relation which attracts to you the undivided &s;olicitudes of the American people and of their friends and foes. <HI>May the God, whom we &s;erve, fill your mind with the knowledge of what concerns our peace, at this awful moment, when he hath ordained the &s;words of all civilized nations (except this highly favored peo|ple) to be either prepared for defence, or to be mo&s;t de&s;tructively ex|erci&s;ed again&s;t each other.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;idering the treaty, lately concluded between Mr. Jay and Lord Grenville, three que&s;tions ari&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether it is expedient to adopt it, as it was made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether it is expedient to reject it, without further en|deavors to adju&s;t the &s;ubject matters: and</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Whether it is expedient to pur&s;ue further amicable mea|&s;ures, &s;atisfactorily and equitably to adju&s;t the &s;ubject matters.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>On the fir&s;t que&s;tion, the &s;enate appear to have been unani|mous in judgment, that <HI>"it was not expedient to adopt the treaty as it was made,"</HI> becau&s;e two-thirds of that body have advi&s;ed you to procure certain alterations, and the remainder of that body voted for &s;ome other alterations. Your own &s;entiments upon the nece&s;&s;ity of amendments are unknown, and it is the object of this examination re&s;pectfully to lay before you &s;uch con&s;iderations, as appear to recommend the employment of this term of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion to procure <HI>all &s;uch meliorations of the treaty, as candid and rea&s;onable inve&s;tigation &s;hall point out.</HI> This contri|bution to the collection of materials, whereon you will form your ultimate determinations, may prove to be very &s;mall. But that reflection ought not to re&s;train well intentioned individuals from contributing their mites to the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd que&s;tion, it appears, that the &s;enate were al&s;o unanimous in their judgment, that <HI>"it is not expedient to reject the treaty without further friendly endeavors to adju&s;t the &s;ubject mat|ters."</HI> For the opponents to the act of the &s;enate, explicitly re|commended further amicable negociation of the treaty with Great Britain: and the act it&s;elf, carried by a re&s;pectable ma|jority,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This majority of two to one, has been con&s;idered as <HI>a bare majority,</HI> becau&s;e it was a bare <HI>quorum.</HI></NOTE> advi&s;es that mode of procedure.</P>
<P>On the third que&s;tion, &s;tated above, the members of the &s;e|nate appear likewi&s;e to have been unanimous, <HI>"that it is enpe|dient
<PB N="16" REF="028389_0303_0FD8EA0B70DA4578">to pur&s;ue further amicable mea&s;ures to adju&s;t &s;atisfactorily and equitably the &s;ubject matters of the treaty."</HI></P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, &s;ir, that the cour&s;e of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s has not yet unfolded the &s;tate of your mind. It is yet un|known, whether the patriotic and re&s;pectable citizen, who was charged with the bu&s;ine&s;s on the part of the United States, was able to accompli&s;h all the objects of his in&s;tructions, conform|ably with your judgment; and it is al&s;o unknown, whether he was led, by the cour&s;e of the negociation, to contract for ob|jects, <HI>which your in&s;tructions had not anticipated,</HI> though his general powers may duly include them.</P>
<P>Although every member of the &s;enate has di&s;countenanced the twelfth article, as it now &s;tands, yet as it is advi&s;ed that amendments be procured, one remark on a point apparently important will be here offered. Be&s;ides the great deviation from reciprocity in regard to the tonnage of our ve&s;&s;els and of theirs in the We&s;t India trade, <HI>the &s;tipulations re&s;pecting goods are al&s;o unequal.</HI> In our limited ve&s;&s;els we may import <HI>only</HI> &s;uch articles as can <HI>now</HI> by <HI>the Briti&s;h laws</HI> be exported from the We&s;t India i&s;lands. The&s;e are about &s;ix enumerated articles, one of which is rarely exported. But in their &s;hips of unlimited &s;ize they can export all We&s;t India articles, which <HI>now</HI> may, by <HI>the laws of the United States,</HI> be imported into this country&mdash;that is to &s;ay, <HI>every thing which is or can be produced by nature, or by cultivation, and every thing manufactured in the We&s;t India i&s;lands.</HI> Whether this was perceived and intended, and, if it was intended, why &s;o clear a departure from reciprocity was agreed to, appear, &s;ir, to be &s;it objects of your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>In order accurately to determine the importance of this plain di&s;crimination again&s;t us, it may be u&s;eful to in&s;pect the li&s;t of the commodities, which Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els may import into the United States by their own application of an act of parlia|ment to this article, and which cannot be imported in our ve&s;|&s;els during the exi&s;tence of the treaty. The principal articles are at pre&s;ent as follow: cotton, indigo, limes, lemons, oranges, turtle, dried and &s;alted hides, yams, mahogany and other ca|binet woods, lign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vitae, fu&s;tic, logwood and other dye woods. As the productions of the We&s;t Indies &s;hall be varied and ex|tended by agricultural enterprize, our privilege will be con|&s;tantly narrowed, and their unequal right, under the treaty, extended in proportion.</P>
<P>There are parts of the pending treaty, which carry the ap|pearance of new or extended grants to aliens of the right to hold lands, and which would enable foreigners to receive them by de&s;cent and purcha&s;e within the United States. Seri|ous
<PB N="17" REF="028389_0304_0FD8EA0F0CE744B8">doubts exi&s;t, whether the formation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the regulations concerning the tenure, acqui&s;ition and de&s;cent of lands within the &s;tates, has been in any, the lea&s;t degree, committed by the acts of the conventions to the general go|vernment. The rai&s;ing of this que&s;tion is &s;ufficient, &s;ir, to in|&s;ure it due con&s;ideration from you, who&s;e judgment on the con&s;titution is your guide. If it be &s;aid, that the pa&s;&s;ages re|ferred to in &s;ome degree confirm what the ancient law and the treaty of 1783 had been before &s;ecured to tho&s;e foreigners, then it may be enquired, whether a preci&s;e and explicit refer|ence back to that former &s;tate of things would not have been mo&s;t prudent and &s;afe. But it will not be di&s;puted that the pre&s;ent treaty goes beyond the rights of the <HI>untenati.</HI> It may be politic to admit foreigners to hold lands, and it may be right to &s;ecure &s;uch as have been conveyed in tru&s;t to di&s;charge ju&s;t debts; but if the &s;tate legi&s;latures have now that power exclu|&s;ively, from the entire omi&s;&s;ion of a grant of it to the general government, it will be que&s;tioned, whether that part of the treaty can be ratified, without a <HI>retro&s;pective</HI> amendment of the con&s;titution, or the con&s;ent of the legi&s;latures of tho&s;e &s;tates, in which any of the lands may lie. If it is urged, that a for|mer treaty gave all or &s;ome of the&s;e privileges to French citi|zens, it may be ob&s;erved, that &s;uch doctrine is of a very re|cent date, that it might appear on inve&s;tigation to be errone|ous, that the French treaty was made under the old confe|deration of the &s;tates, and underwent a different ratification, and was not made under the pre&s;ent definite con&s;titution. It may prevent unea&s;ine&s;s and inconvenience to anticipate, in time for thorough examination, the po&s;&s;ibility, that the judicial courts might decide again&s;t the exi&s;tence of any power in the gene|ral government over the tenure, and particularly over the ac|qui&s;ition, and the de&s;cent of lands within the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>

<HEAD>Defence of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>[CONTINUED FROM VOL. I. PAGE 287.]</P>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd object of the &s;eventh article, as &s;tated in my la&s;t number, is "compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h citizens, for captures of their property within the limits and juri&s;diction of the United States, or el&s;ewhere, by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports, <HI>in the ca&s;es in which the captured property having come within our power, there was a neglect to make re&s;titution.</HI>"</P>
<P>This preci&s;e view of the thing &s;tipulated, is calculated to place the whole &s;ubject at once before the mind, in its true &s;hape; to evince the rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, and to di&s;mi&s;s the objections which have been made, as being foreign to the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The&s;e objections are, in &s;ub&s;tance, that the compen&s;ation promi&s;ed is of great extent and amount; that an enormous expen&s;e is likely to be incurred; and that it is difficult to prove, that a neutral nation is under an obligation to go the lengths of the &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks obviou&s;ly turn upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, errone|ou&s;ly entertained or di&s;ingenuou&s;ly affected,&mdash;that compen&s;a|tion is to be made for <HI>all captures</HI> within our limits or juri&s;dic|tion, or el&s;ewhere, by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports, where re&s;titution has not, in fact, been made. Did the &s;tipula|tion &s;tand on this broad ba&s;is, it would be ju&s;tly liable to the critici&s;m which has been applied to it.&mdash;But the truth is, that its ba&s;ic is far more narrow&mdash;that in&s;tead of extending to all tho&s;e captures, it is confined to the <HI>particular ca&s;es</HI> of them on|ly, in which the captured property came, or was, after the cap|ture, within our power, &s;o as to have admitted of re&s;titution by us, but re&s;titution was not made, through the <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>neglect</HI> of our government. It does not extend to a &s;ingle ca&s;e, where the property, if taken within our juri&s;diction, was im|mediately carried out of our reach&mdash;or where, if taken with|out our juri&s;diction, it was never brought within our reach&mdash;or where, if at any time within our reach, due means were employed without &s;ucce&s;s to effect re&s;titution.</P>
<P>It will follow from this, that the ca&s;es within the purview of the article, mu&s;t be very few&mdash;for, except with regard to three prizes, made in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, where &s;pecial con&s;idera|tions re&s;trained the government from interpo&s;ing, there has been a regular and con&s;tant effort of the executive, in which our courts have efficaciou&s;ly co-operated, to re&s;tore prizes made within our juri&s;diction, or by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports. The
<PB N="19" REF="028389_0306_0FD8EA172151ADA8">extent or amount, therefore, of the compen&s;ation to be made, can by no po&s;&s;ible means be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Let us, however, examine if the con&s;truction I give to the clau&s;e be the true one.</P>
<P>It is in the&s;e words:&mdash;"It is agreed that in all &s;uch ca&s;es where <HI>re&s;titution</HI> &s;hall not have been made <HI>agreeably</HI> to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, dated Sep|tember 5th, 1793, a copy of which is annexed to this treaty, the complaints of the parties &s;hall be and hereby are referred to the commi&s;&s;ioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed in the like manner relative to the&s;e as to the other ca&s;es committed to them; and the United States undertake to pay to the com|plainants in &s;pecie, without deduction, the amount of &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hall be awarded to them re&s;pectively," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The letter of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, by this reference to it, and its annection to the treaty, is made virtually a part of the treaty. The ca&s;es in which compen&s;ation is promi&s;ed, are expre&s;sly tho&s;e in which <HI>re&s;titution</HI> has not been made, <HI>agreebly to the tenor of that letter.</HI></P>
<P>An analy&s;is of the letter will of cour&s;e unfold the ca&s;es in|tended.</P>
<P N="1">1. It recapitulates an a&s;&s;urance before given by a letter of the 7th Augu&s;t, to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, that mea&s;ures were taken for excluding from further a&s;ylum in our ports, ve&s;&s;els armed in them to crui&s;e on nations with which we were at peace, and for the re&s;toration of the prizes the Lovely La&s;s, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; <HI>and that, &s;hould the mea&s;ures of re&s;titution fail in their effect, the pre&s;ident con&s;idered it as incumbent on the United States, to make compen&s;a|tion for the ve&s;&s;els.</HI> The&s;e ve&s;&s;els had been captured by French privateers, originally armed in our ports, and had been after|wards <HI>brought within our ports.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It &s;tates, that we are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">France, Holland, and Pru&s;&s;ia, and our treaty with Sweden includes a like provi&s;o.</NOTE> by all the means in our power, to protect and defend their ve&s;&s;els and effects in our ports or waters, or on the &s;eas near our &s;hore, and to recover and re&s;tore the &s;ame to the right owners, when taken from them; adding, that <HI>if all the means in our power are u&s;ed,</HI> and fail in their effect, we are <HI>not bound</HI> by our treaties to make compen&s;ation. It further &s;tates, that though we have no &s;imilar treaty with Great Bri|tain, it was the opinion of the pre&s;ident, that we &s;hould u&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="028389_0307_0FD8EA1A4D95F378">towards that nation the &s;ame rule which was to govern us with tho&s;e other nations, and even to extend it to captures made on the high &s;eas and <HI>brought into our ports,</HI> if done by ve&s;&s;els which had been armed within them.</P>
<P N="3">3. It then draws this conclu&s;ion, that having, for particular rea&s;ons, <HI>forbore to u&s;e all means in our power</HI> for the re&s;titution of the three ve&s;&s;els mentioned in the letter of the 7th of Au|gu&s;t.&mdash;The pre&s;ident thought it incumbent upon the United States to make compen&s;ation for them: and though nothing was &s;aid in that letter, of other ve&s;&s;els, taken <HI>under like cir|cum&s;tances</HI> and <HI>brought in</HI> after the 5th June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the <HI>&s;ame forbearance</HI> had taken place, it was his opinion, that <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> would be <HI>equally due.</HI> The ca&s;es, then, here de&s;cribed, are tho&s;e in which ille|gal prizes are made, and <HI>brought into our ports,</HI> prior to the 7th of Augu&s;t, 1793, and in which we had <HI>forborn to u&s;e all the means in our power</HI> for re&s;titution. Two characters are made e&s;&s;ential to the ca&s;es in which the compen&s;ation is to be made; one, that the prizes <HI>were brought within our ports</HI>&mdash;the other, that we <HI>forbore to u&s;e all the means in our power</HI> to re&s;tore them.</P>
<P N="4">4. The letter proceeds to ob&s;erve, that, as to prizes made under the <HI>&s;ame circum&s;tances, and brought in</HI> after the date of that letter, the pre&s;ident had determined, <HI>that all means in our power &s;hould be u&s;ed</HI> for their re&s;titution; that if <HI>the&s;e failed,</HI> as we &s;hould not be bound to make compen&s;ation to the other powers, in the analogous ca&s;e, he did <HI>not mean to give an opi|nion, that it ought to be done to Great Britain.</HI> But &s;till, if any ca&s;e &s;hall ari&s;e, &s;ub&s;equent to that date, <HI>the circum&s;tances of which &s;hall place them on a &s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before it,</HI> the pre&s;ident would think compen&s;ation incumbent on the United States. The additional ca&s;es of which an expectation of com|pen&s;ation is given in this part of the letter, mu&s;t &s;tand on <HI>&s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before de&s;cribed</HI>&mdash;that is, they mu&s;t be characteri&s;ed by the two circum&s;tances of a <HI>bringing within our ports,</HI> and a <HI>negle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to u&s;e all the means in our power</HI> for their re|&s;titution. Every where the idea of compen&s;ation is negatived, where the prizes have not come within our power, or where we have not forborn to u&s;e the proper means to re&s;tore them.</P>
<P>The re&s;idue of the letter merely contains &s;ugge&s;tions for giving effect to the foregoing a&s;&s;urances.</P>
<P>This analy&s;is leaves no doubt that the true con&s;truction is &s;uch as I have &s;tated. Can there be any greater doubt that the expectations given by the pre&s;ident, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and which have been only ratified by the treaty, were in them&s;elves proper, and have been properly ratified?</P>

<P>A neutral nation (except as to points to which it is clearly obliged by antecedent treaties) whatever may be its opinion of the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the war on either &s;ide, cannot, with|out departing from its neutrality, <HI>favor</HI> one of two belli|gerent parties more than the other&mdash;<HI>benefit</HI> one, to the <HI>prejudice</HI> of the other&mdash;furni&s;h or permit the furni&s;hing to either, the in&s;truments of acts of ho&s;tility, or any warlike &s;uccour or aid whatever, e&s;pecially without extending the &s;ame advantage to the other&mdash;cannot &s;uffer any force to be exerted, or warlike enterpri&s;e to be carried on from its territory, by one party again&s;t the other, or the preparation or organization there, of the means of annoyance; has a right and is bound to prevent acts of ho&s;tility within its juri&s;diction; and, if they happen again&s;t its will, to re&s;tore any property which may have been taken in exerci&s;ing them. The&s;e po&s;itions will all be found &s;up|ported in the letter or &s;pirit of the following authorities; Bar|beyrac's note on Puffendor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, b. viii. c. vi. &s;. 7.

Bynker&s;hoeck cites examples of re&s;titution in the ca&s;e mentioned.</P>
<P>Every treaty we have made with foreign powers, promi&s;es protection within our juri&s;diction, and the re&s;toration of pro|perty taken there. A &s;imilar &s;tipulation is, indeed, a general formula in treaties, giving an expre&s;s &s;anction to the rule of the laws of nations in this particular.</P>
<P>An act of congre&s;s, of the 5th June, 1794, which is ex|pre&s;sly a declaratory act, recogni&s;es at large the foregoing principles of the laws of nations, providing, among other things, for the puni&s;hment of any per&s;on, who, within the United States, fits out and arms, or attempts to fit out and arm, or procures to be fitted out and armed, or is knowingly concerned in furni&s;hing, fitting out, or arming, of any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, with intent to be employed in the &s;ervice of a fo|reign &s;tate, to crui&s;e or commit ho&s;tilities upon the &s;ubjects or citizens of another foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace; or i&s;&s;ues or delivers a commi&s;&s;ion for any &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or increa&s;es or augments, or procures to be in|crea&s;ed or augmented, or is knowingly concerned in increa&s;|ing or augmenting the force of any &s;hip of war, crui&s;er, or other armed ve&s;&s;el, in the &s;ervice of a foreign &s;tate at war with another foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace;
<PB N="22" REF="028389_0309_0FD8EA1D5516AE80">or within the territory of the United States, begins or fets on foot, or provides or prepares the means of any military expedition or enterpri&s;e, to be carried on from thence again&s;t the dominions of any foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace.</P>
<P>And our courts have adopted, in its fulle&s;t latitude, as con|formable, in their opinion, with tho&s;e laws, the principle of re&s;titution of property, when either captured within our juri&s;|diction, or el&s;ewhere, by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports. The &s;u|preme court of the United States has given to this doctrine, by &s;olemn deci&s;ions, the mo&s;t complete and comprehen&s;ive &s;anction.</P>
<P>It is therefore, undoubtedly, the law of the land, deter|mined by the proper con&s;titutional tribunal, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, that <HI>re&s;titution is due</HI> in the above mentioned ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And it is a direct and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from this, that where it is not made by rea&s;on of the neglect of the govern|ment, to u&s;e the means in its power for the purpo&s;e; there re&s;ults an obligation to make reparation. For, between nations, as between individuals, wherever there exi&s;ts a perfect obliga|tion to do a thing, there is a concomitant obligation to make re|paration for omi&s;&s;ions and neglects.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident was therefore mo&s;t &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable, upon principle, in the opinion which he communicated, that, in the ca&s;es of &s;uch omi&s;&s;ions or neglects, compen&s;ation ought to be made. And in point of policy, nothing could be wi&s;er: for had he not done it, there is the highe&s;t probability, that war would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Our treaty with France forbids us expre&s;sly to permit the privateers of the enemy to arm in our ports, or to bring or &s;ell there the prizes which they have made upon her. We could not, for that rea&s;on, have made the privilege of arming in our ports, if it had been allowed to France, reciprocal.&mdash;The al|lowance of it to her would, con&s;equently, have been a clear violation of neutrality, in the double &s;en&s;e of permitting a military aid, and of permitting it to the one, and refu&s;ing it to the other. Had we &s;uffered France to equip privateers in our ports, to crui&s;e thence upon her enemies, and to bring back and vend there the &s;poils or prizes taken, we &s;hould have be|come by this the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous foe they could have. For, while all our naval re&s;ources might have augmented the force of France, our neutrality, if tolerated, would, in a great degree, have &s;heltered and protected her crui&s;ers. Such a &s;tate of things no nation at war could have acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ced in. And as well to the efficacy of our endeavours to prevent equipments in
<PB N="23" REF="028389_0310_0FD8EA1E80F56838">our ports, as to the proof of the &s;incerity of tho&s;e endea|vours, it was e&s;&s;ential that we &s;hould re&s;tore the prizes which came within our reach, made by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports. It is known, that notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of the government to prevent it, French privateers have been clan-de&s;tinely equipped in &s;ome of our ports, &s;ub&s;equent to the a&s;&s;urances which were given, that the practice would be di&s;|countenanced. If prizes made by &s;uch ve&s;&s;els were &s;uffered to be brought into our ports, and &s;old there, this would be not only a very great encouragement to the practice, but it would be impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be regarded in any other light than as a connivance.</P>
<P>In &s;uch circum&s;tances, can we blame our chief magi&s;trate? Can we even deny him prai&s;e, for having diverted an imminent danger to our peace, by incurring the re&s;pon&s;ibility of giving an expectation of compen&s;ation? The conjuncture we may remem|ber was critical and urgent. Congre&s;s were at the time in re|ce&s;s. A due notice to convene them in &s;o exten&s;ive a country, can hardly be rated at le&s;s than three months.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation our envoy found the bu&s;ine&s;s. It is not true, in the &s;en&s;e in which it has been advanced, that he was to be governed by the fitne&s;s of the thing, unmindful of the opinion of the pre&s;ident. An opinion of the chief magi&s;trate of the union, was to a diplomatic agent an authority and a guide, which he could not ju&s;tifiably have di&s;regarded.&mdash;The claim of compen&s;ation, on the other &s;ide, was greatly <HI>fortified</HI> by this opinion: Nor was it a matter of indifference to our national delicacy and dignity, that the expectation given by it &s;hould be fulfilled. It would have been inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent in our envoy to have re&s;i&s;ted it. It was proper in him, by acceding to it, to refer the matter to the ultimate deci&s;ion of that authority, which, by our con&s;titution, is charged with the power of making trea|ties. It was the more proper, becau&s;e the thing was intrin&s;ically right. Every candid man, every good citizen, will rejoice that the pre&s;ident acted as he did in the fir&s;t in&s;tance&mdash;that our en|voy acted as he did in the &s;econd&mdash;and that the conduct of both has received the final con&s;titutional &s;anction.</P>
<P>The opinions of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, when they can be turned to the di&s;credit of the treaty, are with its adver&s;aries oracular truths. When they are to &s;upport it, they lo&s;e all their weight. The pre&s;umption, that the letter referred to had the concurrence of the judgment of that officer, re&s;ults from a fact, generally under&s;tood and believed, namely, that the proceedings of the pre&s;ident, at the period when it was written, in relation to the
<PB N="24" REF="028389_0311_0FD8EA23E9B86B80">war, were conformable with the unanimous advice of the heads of the executive departments.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e of Briti&s;h property captured by privateers origi|nally armed in our ports, fal&s;ifies the a&s;&s;ertion of the adver&s;a|ries of the treaty, that the preten&s;ions of Great Britain have been fully provided for. She had a colourable ground to claim compen&s;ation for <HI>all captures</HI> made by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports, whither&s;oever carried in, or how&s;oever di&s;po&s;ed of, e&s;pecially where their equipment had been tolerated by our government. This toleration was to be referred, as well from a forbearance to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els when they came within power, as from an original permi&s;&s;ion. Had compen&s;ation been &s;tipulated on this &s;cale, it is not certain that it would not have amounted to as much more than that which has been promi&s;ed, as would counterbalance our claims, for negroes carried away, and for the deten&s;ion of the po&s;ts. But in&s;tead of this, it is narrowed down by the treaty to &s;uch prizes of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els as were brought within our ports, and in re&s;pect to which we forbore to u&s;e all the means in our power for re&s;titution. Here, then is a &s;et off again&s;t doubtful and que&s;tionable claims relinqui&s;hed on our &s;ide. Here, al&s;o, is another proof how much the anta|goni&s;ts of the treaty are in the habit of making random a&s;&s;er|tions. But can we wonder at it, when we reflect that they have undertaken to become the in&s;tructors of their fellow citizens on a &s;ubject, in the examination of which they unite a very &s;uper|ficial knowledge with the mo&s;t perver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions?</P>

Could it have been imagined, that even this &s;imple and equi|table provi&s;ion was de&s;tined not to e&s;cape uncen&s;ured? As if it was predetermined, that not a &s;ingle line of the treaty &s;hould pa&s;s without the imputation of guilt; nothing le&s;s than an in|fraction of the con&s;titution of the United States has been charged upon this article. It attempts, we are told, a di&s;po&s;i|tion of the public money, unwarranted by and contrary to the con&s;titution.&mdash;The examination of this wonderful, &s;agacious ob|jection, with others of a &s;imilar complexion, mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the &s;eparate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which has been promi&s;ed of the con|&s;titutionality of the treaty.</P>
<P>Let us proceed, for the pre&s;ent, to the ninth article.</P>
<P>This article agrees, that Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who <HI>now hold</HI> lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who <HI>now hold</HI> lands in the dominions of his Britannic maje&s;ty, &s;hall continue to hold them, <HI>according to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pective e&s;tates and titles therein;</HI> and may grant, &s;ell, or devi&s;e the &s;ame to whom they plea&s;e, in like manner as if they were natives;&mdash;and that neither they, nor their heirs or a&s;&s;igns, <HI>&s;o far as may re&s;pect the &s;aid lands,</HI> and the legal reme|dies incidental thereto, &s;hall be <HI>regarded as aliens.</HI></P>
<P>The mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of this article, which was fir&s;t u&s;hered into public view, in a very incorrect and in&s;idious &s;hape, and was conceived to amount to the grant of an indefinite and per|manent right to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to hold lands in the United States, did more, it is believed, to excite prejudices again&s;t the treaty, than any thing that is really contained in it. And yet when truly under&s;tood, it is found to be nothing more than a confirmation of tho&s;e rights to lands, which, prior to the treaty, the laws of the &s;everal &s;tates allowed Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to hold;&mdash; with this incon&s;iderable addition, perhaps, that the heirs and a&s;&s;igns of tho&s;e per&s;ons, <HI>though aliens,</HI> may hold the &s;ame lands: but no right whatever is given to lands of which our laws did not permit and legalize the acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions will now be elucidated.</P>
<P>The term, hold, in the legal code of Great Britain and of the&s;e &s;tates, has the &s;ame and that a preci&s;e technical &s;en&s;e&mdash;It imports a <HI>capacity legally</HI> and <HI>rightfully</HI> to <HI>have</HI> and <HI>enjoy</HI> real e&s;tate, and is contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the mere capacity of <HI>taking</HI> or <HI>pur|cha&s;ing,</HI> which is &s;ometimes applicable to the acqui&s;ition of a thing, that is forfeited by the very act of acqui&s;ition. Thus an an alien may <HI>take</HI> real e&s;tate by <HI>purcha&s;e,</HI> but he cannot hold it. Holding is &s;ynonimous with tenure, which, in the feudal &s;y&s;|tem, implies <HI>fealty,</HI> of which an alien is incapable. Land, therefore, is forfeited to the government, the in&s;tant it pa&s;&s;es
<PB N="26" REF="028389_0313_0FD8EA27AF2AF768">to an alien. The Roman law nullifies the contract entirely; &s;o that nothing pa&s;&s;es by the grant of land to an alien: but out law, derived from that of England, permits the land to pa&s;s for the purpo&s;e of forfeiture to the &s;tate. This is not the ca&s;e with regard to <HI>de&s;cent,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion there, being an act of law, and the alien being di&s;qualified to hold, the law, con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, ca&s;ts no e&s;tate upon him.</P>
<P>The following legal authorities, &s;elected from an infinite number of &s;imilar ones, e&s;tabli&s;h the above po&s;itions, viz. COKE on LITTLETON, page 2, 3.&mdash;"Some men have <HI>capa|city</HI> to <HI>purcha&s;e,</HI> but not <HI>ability</HI> to <HI>hold.</HI> Some, <HI>capacity</HI> to <HI>pur|cha&s;e</HI> and <HI>ability</HI> to <HI>hold</HI> or <HI>not to hold,</HI> at the election of them|&s;elves and others. Some, capacity to <HI>take</HI> and to <HI>hold.</HI> Some, neither capacity to <HI>take</HI> nor to <HI>hold,</HI> And, &s;ome are &s;pecially di&s;abled to <HI>take</HI> &s;ome <HI>particular thing.</HI>&mdash;If an alien, Chri&s;tian or Infidel, <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> hou&s;es, lands, tenements, or hereditaments to him and his heirs, albeit he can have no heirs, yet he is of capacity to <HI>take</HI> a fee &s;imple, but <HI>not to hold.</HI>"&mdash;The &s;ame, page 8. "If a man &s;eized of land in fee, hath i&s;&s;ue an alien, he cannot be heir, <HI>propter defectum &s;ubjectianis.</HI>"&mdash;Black&s;tone's commentaries, book II. chap. xviii. &sect; 2. "Alienation to an alien is a cau&s;e of forfeiture to the crown of the lands &s;o alien|ated, not only on account of his <HI>incapacity to hold</HI> them, but likewi&s;e on account of his pre&s;umption in attempting, by an act of his own, to acquire real property." Idem, chap. xix. &sect; 1. "the ca&s;e of an alien born, is al&s;o peculiar; for he may <HI>pur|cha&s;e</HI> a thing; but, after purcha&s;e, he can hold nothing, except a lea&s;e for years of a hou&s;e, for the convenience of merchan|dize."</P>
<P>Thus it is evident, that by the laws of England, which it will not be denied, agree in principle with ours, an ALIEN may <HI>take</HI> but cannot <HI>hold</HI> lands.</P>
<P>It is equally clear, the laws of both countries agreeing in this particular, that the word <HI>hold,</HI> u&s;ed in the article under con&s;ideration, mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to tho&s;e laws, and therefore can only apply to tho&s;e ca&s;es in which there was a <HI>legal capacity to hold</HI>&mdash;in other words, tho&s;e in which our laws permitted the &s;ubjects and citizens of the two parties to <HI>hold</HI> lands in the territories of each other. Some of the&s;e ca&s;es ex|i&s;ted prior to the treaty of peace; and where confi&s;cations had not taken place, there has never been a doubt, that the property was effectually protected by that treaty&mdash;Others have ari&s;en &s;ince that treaty, under &s;pecial &s;tatutes of particular &s;tates. Whether there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> others depending on the principles of the common law, need not be enquired into here, &s;ince the late
<PB N="27" REF="028389_0314_0FD8EA2890E005C8">treaty will neither &s;trengthen nor impair the operation of tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>Whatever lands, therefore, may have been purcha&s;ed by any Briti&s;h &s;ubject, &s;ince the treaty of peace, which the laws of the &s;tate wherein they were purcha&s;ed did not permit him to acquire and hold, are entirely out of the protection of the ar|ticle under con&s;ideration; the purcha&s;e will not avail him; the forfeiture, which was incurred by it, is &s;till in full force. 'As to tho&s;e lands which the laws of a &s;tate allowed him to pur|cha&s;e and hold, he owes his title to them, not to the treaty.</P>
<P>Let us recur to the words of the article, "Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who <HI>now hold</HI> lands, &s;hall <HI>continue</HI> to <HI>hold</HI> them <HI>according to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pective e&s;tates and titles therein.</HI>" But it has been &s;een, that to <HI>hold</HI> lands is to own them in a legal and competent capacity, and that an alien has no &s;uch capacity. The lands, therefore, which, by rea&s;on of the alienage of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, he could not, prior to the treaty, legally pur|cha&s;e and hold&mdash;he cannot, under the treaty, continue to hold. As if it was de&s;igned to render this conclu&s;ion palpable, the provi&s;ion goes on to &s;ay, "According to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pective e&s;tates and titles therein." This is equivalent to &s;aying, they &s;hall continue to hold as they before held. If they had no valid e&s;tate or title before, they will of cour&s;e con|tinue to have none&mdash;the expre&s;&s;ions neither give any new, nor enlarge any old e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding clau&s;es relate only to de&s;cents or alienations of the land originally legally holden. Here the di&s;ability of ali|enage is taken away from the heirs and a&s;&s;igns of the primitive proprietors. While this will conduce to private ju&s;tice, by en|abling the families and friends of the individuals to enjoy their property by de&s;cent or devi&s;e, which it is pre&s;umable, was the main object of the provi&s;ion, there is no con&s;ideration of na|tional policy that weighs again&s;t it. If we admit the whole force of the argument, which oppo&s;es the expediency of per|mitting aliens to hold lands (and concerning which I &s;hall barely remark here, that it is contrary to the practice of &s;everal of the &s;tates, and to a practice from which &s;ome of them have hi|therto derived material advantages) the extent to which the prin|ciple is affected by the pre&s;ent treaty is too limited to be felt, and in the rapid mutations of property, it will every day dimi|ni&s;h. Every alienation of a parcel of the privileged land to a citizen of the United States, will, as to that land, by inter|rupting the chain, put an end to the future operation of the privilege; and the lap&s;e of no great number of years may be
<PB N="28" REF="028389_0315_0FD8EA2D490D1F98">expected to make an entire revolution in the property, &s;o as to dive&s;t the whole of the privilege.</P>
<P>To manife&s;t the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the loud and virulent clamour, which was excited again&s;t this article, it has been ob&s;erved by the friends of the in&s;trument, that our treaty with France not only grants a much larger privilege to the citizens of France, but goes the full length of removing univer&s;ally and perpetually from them the di&s;ability of alieni&s;m, as to the own|er&s;hip of lands. This po&s;ition has been flatly denied by &s;ome of the writers on the other &s;ide. Decius in particular, after taking pains to &s;how that it is erroneous&mdash;that the terms "goods moveable and immoveable," in the article of our treaty with France, mean only <HI>chattels</HI> real and per&s;onal in the &s;en&s;e of our law, and exclude a right to the freehold and inheritance of lands, triumphantly plumes him&s;elf on the detection of a fallacy of the writer of certain "candid remarks on the treaty," who gives the interpretation above &s;tated to that article.</P>
<P>The error of Decius's interpretation, proceeds from a mi&s;|under&s;tanding of the term goods, in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the article, to which he annexes the meaning a&s;&s;igned to that term in our law, in&s;tead of re&s;orting, as he ought to have done, to the French laws for the true meaning of the corre&s;|pondent term <HI>biens,</HI> which is that u&s;ed in the French original. Goods, in our law, no doubt, mean chattel intere&s;ts: but goods or "biens" in the French law, mean all kinds of pro|perty, <HI>real</HI> as well as per&s;onal. It is equivalent to, and derived from, the term <HI>bona,</HI> in the Roman law, an&s;wering mo&s;t near|ly to <HI>"e&s;tates"</HI> in our law, and embracing inheritances in land, corporeal and incorporeal hereditaments, as well as pro|perty in moveable things.</P>

Being a mere word of tran&s;lation, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the meaning of the French text; for it is declared in the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, that it was originally compo&s;ed and concluded in the French tongue. Moreover, the term <HI>goods,</HI> when u&s;ed in our language, as the equivalent of the term <HI>bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> or <HI>biens,</HI> is always under&s;tood in the large &s;en&s;e of the original term; in other words, as comprehending real and per&s;onal e&s;tate, inheritances as well as chattel intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having now e&s;tabli&s;hed the true meaning of the terms "goods moveable and immoveable," let us proceed with this guide to a review of the article.</P>
<P>Its fir&s;t and principal feature is, "that the &s;ubjects and inha|bitants of the United States, or any of them, &s;hall not be re|puted AUBAINS in France. This is the &s;ame as if it had been &s;aid, "they &s;hall not be reputed ALIENS." For the definition of AUBAINS, as given in the work before fir&s;t cited, is this&mdash; "AUBAINS are per&s;ons not born under the dominion of the king," the exact equivalent of the definition of ALIEN in the Engli&s;h law. If our citizens are not to be reputed aliens in France, it follows, that they mu&s;t be exempted from alien di&s;|abilities, and mu&s;t have the &s;ame rights with natives, as to ac|quiring, conveying, and &s;ucceeding to real and other e&s;tate. Accordingly the article, having pronounced that our citizens &s;hall not be reputed aliens in France, proceeds to draw certain con&s;equences. The fir&s;t is, that they &s;hall not be &s;ubject to the <HI>droit d'aubaine.</HI> The <HI>droit d'aubaine</HI> was, under the monarchy, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the regalia; it was the right of the prince to &s;ucceed to all e&s;tates or property &s;ituate in the kingdom, belonging to fo|reigners, who died without legitimate children, born in the kingdom.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that the laws of France permitted fo|reigners to acquire and hold even real e&s;tates, &s;ubject to the right of the &s;overeign, in ca&s;e of demi&s;e without i&s;&s;ue born under his allegiance. But this right of the &s;overeign, as to
<PB N="31" REF="028389_0318_0FD8EA3497E38638">American citizens, is abrogated by the treaty; &s;o that their legal repre&s;entatives, wherever born, may &s;ucceed to all the property, real or per&s;onal, which they may have acquired in France.</P>
<P>And, in conformity to this, it is further declared, that they may, by te&s;tament, donation, or otherwi&s;e, di&s;po&s;e of their goods, moveable and immoveable (that is, as we have &s;een, their e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal) in favor of &s;uch per&s;ons as to them &s;hall appear good; &s;o that their heirs, &s;ubjects of the United States, whether re&s;iding in France or el&s;ewhere, may &s;ucceed to them, <HI>ab inte&s;tato,</HI> without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;tipulations on the part of France; and they amount to a removal from the citizens of the United States, of alien di&s;abilities in that country, as to property. I &s;ay as to property, becau&s;e, as to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments, it &s;eems to have been a principle of the French law, that the incapacity of foreigners could only be removed by &s;pecial di&s;|pen&s;ations, directed to the particular object.</P>
<P>What are the correlative &s;tipulations on the part of the United States? They are in the&s;e terms, "the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king &s;hall enjoy, on their part, in all the domi|nions of the &s;aid &s;tates, an <HI>entire</HI> and <HI>perfect reciprocity,</HI> relative to the &s;tipulations contained in this article. But it is at the &s;ame time agreed, that its contents &s;hall not affect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, again&s;t emigrations, which &s;hall remain in all their force and vigour; and the United States on their part, or any of them, &s;hall be at liberty to enact &s;uch laws relative to that matter, as to them &s;hall appear proper."</P>
<P>Since, then, the article removes from our citizens the di&s;abili|ties of aliens as to property in France, and &s;tipulates for her citizens, an entire and perfect reciprocity in the United States, it follows, that Frenchmen are equally exempt in the United States from the like di&s;abilities. They may, therefore, hold, &s;uc|ceed to, and di&s;po&s;e of, real e&s;tates.</P>
<P>It appears that the &s;en&s;e both of the French and of the Ame|rican government has corre&s;ponded with this con&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the year 1786, the Marquis Bellegarde and the Chevalier Meziere, &s;ons of the two &s;i&s;ters of General Oglethorpe, repre|&s;ented to the Count de Vergennes, the French mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, that they met with impediments to their claims from the laws of Georgia, prohibiting aliens to hold lands. Mr. de Vergennes communicated their complaint to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, our then mini&s;ter in France, ob&s;erving, that the alien di&s;abili|ties
<PB N="32" REF="028389_0319_0FD8EA3A33812670">of the complainants having, in common with tho&s;e of all Frenchmen, been removed by the treaty between the two coun|tries, they ought to experience no impediments on that account, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tate of their uncle, and that the inter|fering laws of Georgia ought to be repealed &s;o as to agree with the treaty.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in reply, &s;tates the ca&s;e of the complainants, proving that they were precluded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for other rea&s;ons than that of alieni&s;m; and then adds, that as the treaty with France having placed the &s;ubjects of France in the United States on a footing with natives, as to conveyances and <HI>de&s;cents</HI> of property, there is no nece&s;&s;ity for the a&s;&s;emblies to pa&s;s laws on the &s;ubject, the treaty being a law, as he conceives, &s;uperior to tho&s;e of particular a&s;&s;emblies, and repealing them when they &s;tand in the way of its operation.</P>
<P>Where now, DECIUS, is thy mighty triumph? Where the trophies of thy fancied victory? Learn that in political, as well as other &s;cience,
<Q><L>"Shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,</L>
<L>And drinking largely &s;obers us again."</L></Q></P>
<P>The fixing the true &s;en&s;e of the article in the treaty with Great Britain, is alone a refutation of mo&s;t of the objections which have been made to it, by &s;howing, that they apply not to what really exi&s;ts, but to a quite different thing. It may be u&s;e|ful, however, to pa&s;s them briefly in review with &s;ome cur&s;ory remarks.</P>
<P>The article, it is &s;aid, infringes the rights of the &s;tates, and impairs the obligation of private contracts, permits aliens to hold real e&s;tates again&s;t the fundamental policy of our laws, and at the hazard of introducing a dangerous foreign influence; is unequal, becau&s;e no American has been hardy enough, &s;ince the peace, to purcha&s;e lands in England, while millions of acres have been purcha&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in our country, with knowledge of the ri&s;k&mdash;is not warranted by the example of any other treaty we have made; for if even that of France &s;hould contain a &s;imilar provi&s;ion (which is denied) &s;till the difference of circum&s;tances would make it an inappo&s;ite precedent; &s;ince this was a treaty made, <HI>flagrante bello,</HI> in a &s;ituation which ju&s;tified <HI>&s;acrifices.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e objections have been formally and explicitly urged. One writer, afraid of ri&s;king a direct a&s;&s;ertion, but in&s;idiou&s;ly endeavoring to in&s;inuate mi&s;conception, contents him&s;elf with putting a que&s;tion. What (&s;ays he) will be the effect of this article as to the revival of the claims of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, trai|tors or exiles?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="028389_0320_0FD8EA3D8B06BD18">
As to the infraction of the rights of the &s;tates, this, it is pre&s;umed, mu&s;t relate to the depriving them of forfeitures of alien property. But as the article gives no right to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject to hold any lands which the laws of a &s;tate did not previou&s;ly authorize him to hold&mdash;it prevents no forfeiture to which he was &s;ubject by them, and, con&s;equently, deprives no &s;tate of the benefit of any &s;uch forfeiture. With regard to e&s;|cheats for want of qualified heirs, it depended on every pro|prietor to avoid them by alienations to citizens.</P>
<P>As to impairing the obligation of private contracts, it is difficult to under&s;tand what is meant. Since land, purcha&s;ed by an alien, pa&s;&s;es from the former proprietor, and becomes forfeited to the &s;tate, can it be afterwards the &s;ubject of a va|lid private contract? If the effect of the article was to con|firm a defective title derived from the alien, how could this impair the obligation of any other private contract concerning it? But whatever may be intended, it is enough to &s;ay, that the article does not confirm the title to any land which was not before good. So that the ground of the objection fails.</P>
<P>As to permitting aliens to hold land, contrary to the policy of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws, it has been &s;hown, that, on a true con&s;truction, it only applies to the very limited ca&s;e of the alien heirs and a&s;&s;igns of per&s;ons who before rightfully held lands, and is confined to the identical lands &s;o previou&s;ly holden; that its greate&s;t effect mu&s;t be in&s;ignificant; and that this effect will continually decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the millions of acres, &s;aid to have been purcha&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;ince the peace, it has been &s;hown, that if by the laws of the &s;tates in which the purcha&s;es were made, they were illegally acquired, they &s;till remain in the &s;ituation in which they were before the treaty.</P>
<P>As to there being no precedent of a &s;imilar &s;tipulation with any other country, it has been proved, that, with <HI>France,</HI> we have one much broader. The idea, that this was a &s;acrifice to the nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;ituation, <HI>flagrante bello,</HI> is new. Are we then to under&s;tand, that we in this in&s;tance gave to France, as the <HI>price</HI> of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a privilege in our country, which leads to the introduction of a foreign influence, dangerous to our independence and pro&s;perity? For to this re&s;ult tends the argument concerning the policy of the exclu&s;ion of aliens. Or is it, that no privilege, granted to France, can be dan|gerous?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not orthodox enough to adopt this la&s;t po|&s;ition, may, neverthele&s;s, tranquillize them&s;elves about the con|&s;equences. This is not the channel through which a dangerous
<PB N="34" REF="028389_0321_0FD8EA3F08750618">foreign influence can a&s;&s;ail us. Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid, it may, perhaps, bear a &s;erious argument, whether the permi&s;&s;ion to foreigners to hold lands in our country, might not, by the operation of private intere&s;t, give us more influ|ence upon foreign countries, than they will ever acquire upon us, from the holding of tho&s;e lands. Be this as it may, could we not appeal to &s;ome <HI>good patriots,</HI> as they &s;tile them&s;elves, by way of eminence, for the truth of the ob&s;ervation, that foreign governments have more direct and powerful means of influence than can ever re&s;ult from the right in que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Moreover, there was a peculiar rea&s;on for the provi&s;ion which has been made in our la&s;t treaty, not applicable to any treaty with another country. The former relative &s;ituation of the United States and Great Britain, led to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of lands by the citizens of each in the re&s;pective territories. It was natural and ju&s;t to &s;ecure by treaty their free tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion to the heirs and a&s;&s;igns of the parties.</P>
<P>As to the revival of the claims of traitors or exiles; if pro|perty, <HI>confi&s;cated</HI> and <HI>taken away,</HI> is property <HI>holden</HI> by tho&s;e who have been deprived of it, then there may be ground for alarm on this &s;core. How painful is it to behold &s;uch gro&s;s at|tempts to deceive a whole people on &s;o momentous a que&s;tion! How afflicting, that impo&s;ture and fraud &s;hould be &s;o often able to a&s;&s;ume with &s;ucce&s;s the garb of patrioti&s;m? And that this &s;ublime virtue &s;hould be &s;o frequently di&s;credited by the u&s;urpation and abu&s;e of its name!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>At a Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Lexington (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts)</HI> legally a&s;&s;embled, <DATE>Augu&s;t <HI>13th, 1795,</HI></DATE> to know the Sentiments of the Town, upon the Com|mercial Treaty between the United States and the Briti&s;h Nation, as agreed to by Mr. Jay.<LB>BENJAMIN BROWN, E&s;quire, Moderator.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;aid treaty was read&mdash;a conver&s;ation upon the &s;ubject took place; and ob&s;ervations, obviou&s;ly occurring, were freely and candidly made upon the treaty: And a committee
<PB N="35" REF="028389_0322_0FD8EA44A59F9780">was cho&s;en, to take into con&s;ideration the &s;aid treaty, and re|port thereon at the adjournment.</P>
<P>At the meeting, according to adjournment, September 7th, the committee &s;ubmitted the following draught, as an attempt to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of the town, on the intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject committed to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Claiming it as one among the unalienable rights, for which we have fought and bled, and which we hold dear and &s;acred, as freemen, and citizens of a free &s;tate, freely, candidly, and firmly, to expre&s;s our &s;entiments upon any public mea&s;ure, which appears intere&s;ting to us, our fellow citizens, &s;tate, of nation; and having deliberately attended to, and con&s;idered, the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between Great Britain and the United States of America, agreed upon and &s;igned by the Right Honorable William Wyndham, Baron Grenville, on the one part, and the Honorable John Jay, E&s;quire, on the other; and which hath been ratified, with certain ex|ceptions, by the &s;enate of the United States.</P>
<P>We, the inhabitants of the &s;aid town of Lexington, in town meeting a&s;&s;embled, unhappily find our&s;elves con&s;trained to ob|&s;erve, that, from the general &s;entiments and principles of the treaty at large, the mo&s;t natural con&s;truction of the &s;everal ar|ticles contained in it, or the mea&s;ures and regulations therein &s;tipulated and held up to view, we cannot even flatter our&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e benefits and advantages, political, civil or commercial, which, as free citizens and an inde|pendent nation, we had a right to expect, in &s;uch a negocia|tion as this.</P>
<P>That, viewed in compari&s;on with exi&s;ting treaties of amity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> merce, between France and the United States, and the United States of Holland and the United States of Ame|rica, we do not find that fair and perfect reciprocity of privi|leges and advantages, in the <HI>pre&s;ent treaty,</HI> as evidently appears in them. On the contrary, as it appears to us, the &s;tipulations of the pre&s;ent treaty, in &s;everal in&s;tances, at lea&s;t, in their ope|ration, mu&s;t tend, directly or indirectly, to deprive us of the benefits and privileges intended to be &s;ecured to the citizens of the United States, as a neutral nation, by tho&s;e treaties. Par|ticularly in tho&s;e articles of the pre&s;ent treaty, where provi&s;i|ons and other articles, not explicitly contraband of war, by the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed law of nations, are made liable to capture and adjudication, the parties making compen&s;ation, as they may &s;ee fit, as &s;pecified in &s;aid article. This, as we think, at once throws an important branch of the trade of he United States, as a neutral nation, into the hands and on the mercy of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="36" REF="028389_0323_0FD8EA45D6D78CA8">government. Be&s;ides, admitting this privilege to the Briti&s;h, the French and the Dutch may claim the &s;ame: For, by treaty, they are entitled to the privileges of the mo&s;t &s;avored nation. The con&s;equences are too obvious to need a mention.</P>
<P>By the &s;econd article, provi&s;ion is made for the delivering up the we&s;tern po&s;ts, held by the Briti&s;h within the limits of the United States, after twelve years detention, contrary to expre&s;s &s;tipulation of the treaty of peace, in 1783. And though it is too obvious to need any proof, that the detention of the&s;e po&s;ts hath been to the great injury of the United States, in the progre&s;s of their &s;ettlements and trade with the Indians;&mdash; but, above all, in fo&s;tering and encouraging, if not actually &s;upporting, a long, expen&s;ive and de&s;tructive war with the In|dians; yet no provi&s;ion is &s;tipulated for any, the lea&s;t, com|pen&s;ation for tho&s;e injuries. Neither is there, in any part of the treaty, any provi&s;ion made for compen&s;ation for Negroes, or other property carried off by Britons, contrary to the expre&s;s prohibiti|on in the treaty of peace between Britain and the United States. Whereas the mo&s;t ample provi&s;ion is made, in the 6th article, for the payment of private debts, to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, contract|ed before the peace, out of the public trea&s;ury, with intere&s;t for the &s;ame, to the utmo&s;t farthing. What is the ju&s;tice, what the reciprocity of the&s;e mea&s;ures and &s;tipulations of the treaty, we leave to the principles of equality and common &s;en&s;e to determine. The contra&s;t is too glaring to need, or even ad|mit of, illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame article, it is provided, after the evacuation of &s;aid po&s;ts, &amp;c. "That all &s;ettlers and traders within the pre|cincts or juri&s;diction of &s;aid po&s;ts, &s;hall continue to enjoy all their property of every kind, and &s;hall be protected therein. They &s;hall be at free liberty to remain or remove, to &s;ell or re|tain. They &s;hall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take an oath of allegiance to the govern|ment thereof: But they &s;hall be at full liberty to do &s;o, if they think proper, and they &s;hall make and declare their election, within one year after the evacuation afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>How far the precincts or juri&s;diction of the&s;e po&s;ts do or may extend, we are yet to learn; but be they greater or le&s;s, by this article, all who, within the time pre&s;cribed, declare their election to continue Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, are at free liberty &s;o to do. And thus hundreds, or perhaps thou&s;ands, of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and citizens, with the children of them, to a thou&s;and generations, may claim an indi&s;putable right to all the benefits and privileges of natural born &s;ubjects and citizens, in their per&s;ons, property and e&s;tate, and yet have no connection with,

This unlimited indulgence appears to us to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with all prin|ciples of &s;ound policy, and of mo&s;t dangerous tendency.</P>
<P>To &s;ay nothing of an undue Briti&s;h influence, on our inter|nal affairs, ari&s;ing from this quarter; the moment a war begins between Britain and the United States, they become, of all men, the mo&s;t dangerous: And whether they continue with us or go from us, they may, and, to prove them&s;elves faithful to the prince or &s;tate of who&s;e government they are &s;ubjects, they mu&s;t, become the mo&s;t injurious; as they will have it in their power to give the be&s;t information to the enemy, and, as pi|lots, to lead and conduct them where they can injure us mo&s;t, and have the be&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature, on the &s;ame general principles, liable to the &s;ame objections, and of equally dangerous tendency to the United States, is the 9th article in &s;aid treaty. And though there is an appearance of reciprocity, in the &s;tipulation, that "Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of the king of Great Britain, &s;hall continue to hold them, according to the nature and tenure of their e&s;tates and titles therein; and may grant, &s;ell, or devi&s;e the &s;ame to whom they plea&s;e, in like manner as if they were natives," &amp;c. Yet when it is con&s;idered, that by well known laws of the Briti&s;h government, aliens are incapacitated to hold real e&s;tates, the article appears to be nugatory and delu&s;ive; or even &s;up|po&s;e this not to be the ca&s;e, this article will, at any rate, be in favor of Britain, and detrimental to the United States, as "The quantity of lauds, held by the citizens of the United States in the Briti&s;h dominions, will, probably, bear no propor|tion to the quantity held by the &s;ubjects of Britain, in the United States."</P>
<P>How far the United States, or the citizens thereof, may avail them&s;elves of benefit, profit or advantage from the liber|ty &s;tipulated for the &s;ubjects of Britain, the citizens of the United States, and al&s;o the Indians, freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s the boundary line, by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties, for the pur|po&s;es of trade and commerce, as agreed in the 3d article, we are much in doubt: And from attending to the nature and probable con&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;tipulation, are led to &s;uppo&s;e that the inconveniencies attending, and &s;acrifices which mu&s;t be made, by acceding to, this agreement, will greatly overbalance every benefit that would be like to accrue to the United States
<PB N="38" REF="028389_0325_0FD8EA4F235FF438">or their citizens: And that under an appearance of reciprocity, the balance would turn greatly in favor of Britain. But be this as it may, it is certain, that by excepting the country with|in the limits of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d&s;on's Bay company, the United States are deprived of a great part of the fur trade with the Indians, to which, by local &s;ituation, they have as good a claim as Bri|tain. By this means all reciprocity is de&s;troyed, and &s;uch an exception appears both ungenerous and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s unequal is the &s;tipulation, in the paragraph imme|diately &s;ucceeding, in the &s;ame article; for all ve&s;&s;els of the United States are expre&s;sly excluded admi&s;&s;ion into any of his Briti&s;h maje&s;ty's "Sea ports, harbours, bays or creeks, in his &s;aid territories, or into &s;uch parts of the rivers, in his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories, as are between the mouth thereof and the high|e&s;t ports of entry from the &s;ea;" barely excepting "&s;mall ve&s;|&s;els trading <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Quebec," under certain regulations:&mdash;While Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els may claim admi&s;&s;ion into all &s;ea-ports, bays, harbours, and even into all rivers, to the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els, in the United States. No comment is nece&s;&s;ary. The very words of the trea|ty it&s;elf, naturally lead us&mdash;with a&s;toni&s;hment, not to &s;ay, in|dignation&mdash;to a&s;k, What equality&mdash;what reciprocity is here!</P>
<P>It is added, in the very next &s;entence, in this article&mdash;"The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;hall, however, <HI>according to the treaty of peace,</HI> be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, <HI>to which &s;oever of the parties belonging,</HI> may freely be re&s;orted to, and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ty, in Great Britain." Upon which we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve;</P>
<P>That we are utterly at a lo&s;s to account for an idea or prin|ciple &s;ugge&s;ted, that the ports and places of re&s;ort for ve&s;&s;els, &s;hipping, &amp;c. on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, may be|long either to Britain or the United States, be Briti&s;h ports, or ports of the United States, promi&s;cuou&s;ly and indefinitely, as if the land, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the &s;aid Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, was the property of, and held in common by, both nations: whereas, by the treaty of peace, it is explicitly declared, that the boundary of the territory of the United States, on that quarter, &s;hould be "by a line to be drawn along the middle of the &s;aid river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, until it &s;hall inter&s;ect the northernmo&s;t part of the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t degree of north latitude."</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principles we &s;ee not but with equal pro|priety, Briti&s;h ports and places of re&s;ort for ve&s;&s;els, &s;hipping,
<PB N="39" REF="028389_0326_0FD8EA504FFC3190">&amp;c. might be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Atlantic</HI> for like purpo&s;es, on the territory of United States, from <HI>Georgia</HI> to <HI>Nova Scotia;</HI> and with equal advantage, perhaps, to the &s;tates and citizens of them. The truth is, while mutual advan|tage, perhaps, might re&s;ult to the citizens and &s;ubjects of both the contracting nations, by opening their ports to each other, on terms of equality, it is hard to find principles to ju&s;tify the policy, or even &s;afety of admitting another nation to e&s;tabli&s;h ports and places of re&s;ort, in the manner &s;tipulated in this arti|cle, as it appears to us.</P>
<P>Whatever "doubt may have ari&s;en concerning the river truly intended under the name of <HI>the river St. Croix,</HI> menti|oned in the treaty of peace, as forming a part of the boundary therein de&s;cribed,"&mdash;we cannot feel &s;atisfied with the mode of adju&s;tment, propo&s;ed in the 5th article of the treaty&punc; To us it appears impolitic, unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, that the title to &s;o great an extent of territory, as is drawn in que&s;tion by &s;aid doubts, &s;hould be ri&s;qued on the ca&s;ting of a <HI>die,</HI> or the draw|ing of a <HI>lot.</HI></P>
<P>The treaty profe&s;&s;es to have "no reference to the merits of the complaints and preten&s;ions of the contracting parties;" yet, as we have already ob&s;erved, "tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h are fully pro|vided for, while a part only of tho&s;e of the United States are attended to;" vide and comp. art. 6th and 7th.</P>
<P>We are more e&s;pecially di&s;&s;atisfied with this treaty, as, with our fellow citizens in Bo&s;ton, we conceive, "that the capture of ve&s;&s;els and property of the citizens of the United States, during the pre&s;ent war, made under the authority of the government of Great Britain, is a national concern; and claims ari&s;ing from &s;uch captures ought not to have been &s;ubmitted to the deci&s;ion of their admiralty courts; as the United States are thereby pre|cluded from having a voice in the final determination of &s;uch ca&s;es; and becau&s;e the indemnification propo&s;ed to be made, is to be &s;ought by a proce&s;s tedious and expen&s;ive, in which ju&s;tice may be delayed to an unrea&s;onable time, and eventually lo&s;t to many of the &s;ufferers, from their inability to pur&s;ue it; and becau&s;e this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the &s;ummary method adopted for the &s;atisfaction of Briti&s;h claims." Vide proceedings at Bo&s;ton, article 4th.</P>
<P>However di&s;agreeable to the feelings of a benevolent heart it may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear, to arre&s;t the property of unoffend|ing individuals of foreign nations; yet, in the cour&s;e of events, certain circum&s;tances may ari&s;e, in which &s;uch property may be the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and effectual pledge for the peace, &s;afety, independence, and even exi&s;tence of a nation. We canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="40" REF="028389_0327_0FD8EA51D7B57D10">therefore, admit the idea of the nece&s;&s;ary, ju&s;tice, or policy of the total prohibition of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, as we find in the 10th article of the treaty. Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e the &s;eque&s;tration of the debts of individuals, for the common &s;afety of a nation, to be any more incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of equity, or com|mutative ju&s;tice, than what every day takes place between contending nations at war, under the &s;anction of law and the highe&s;t authority, in privateering and otherwi&s;e, in almo&s;t every act and event of war.</P>
<P>The 12th article, in every point of view, appears to us un|profitable, degrading, and humiliating to the United States; And although the &s;enate have declined to ratify a part of it, yet, as it will remain after the alteration the &s;enate hath pro|po&s;ed, it will cut off a very advantageous part of our trade, in the exportation of certain We&s;t India articles, from where&s;o|ever imported, and even &s;ome articles, the produce of the United States, to any part of the world. Nor are the regulations and re&s;trictions on the trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, le&s;s degrading and de&s;tructive, as &s;tipulated in the 13th article.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding articles relating to commerce, to articles con|traband of war, to mutual privileges of ve&s;&s;els entering the ports of the contracting parties&mdash;whether of war or for com|merce, and many other matters connected therewith; while, in various re&s;pects, under the veil of reciprocity, they obviou&s;ly fail of promi&s;ing equal advantages to the United States and their citizens; are, in many important in&s;tances, as direct con|traventions of privileges expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, in treaties, in favor of France and the United Provinces of Holland: and cannot fail to operate accordingly.</P>
<P>A &s;aving clau&s;e is, indeed, introduced in the 25th article, providing, "that nothing in this treaty contained &s;hall be con|&s;trued to operate contrary to former and exi&s;ting treaties, with other &s;overeigns or &s;tates." How this provi&s;o can be con&s;i&s;tently or &s;incerely pretended, we are totally at a lo&s;s to determine; when it is evident, that the greater part of the latter articles, which are temporary, are obviou&s;ly intended to operate in favor of the contracting parties, particularly Britain, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent war, as well as afterwards; and of con&s;equence mu&s;t, in a degree, be &s;ubver&s;ive of benefits and advantages &s;tipulated in favor of France and Holland, in our treaties with them.</P>
<P>It is immediately &s;ubjoined, that "the two parties agree that while they continue in amity with each other, neither of them will in future make any treaty incon&s;i&s;tent with this or the pre|ceding article." So that whatever advantages with other nations may offer, on the&s;e points, the United States are totally ex|cluded
<PB N="41" REF="028389_0328_0FD8EA59E4053CB8">from availing them&s;elves thereof, during the exi&s;tence of this part of the treaty.</P>
<P>But what appears mo&s;t of all intere&s;ting and alarming to us, and to the citizens of the United States at large, in the treaty, is yet to be mentioned.</P>
<P>It appears to us incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit, the principles, and the very letter of the con&s;titution of the United States, and, in many in&s;tances, &s;ubver&s;ive of them.</P>
<P>In &s;ociety and government, an executive, <HI>be it the &s;upreme,</HI> evidently &s;uppo&s;es a legi&s;lative as at the foundation and above it; and the executive as acting under it, obedient to its laws and directions, and accountable to it.</P>
<P>In the &s;ocial compact, or con&s;titution of a nation, the pow|ers of legi&s;lation are the fir&s;t and &s;upreme powers delegated by the people, who are the &s;overeign, and, of right, have and retain the controul of all the powers of government, in &s;ociety, at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>All other powers of government, the &s;upreme executive, as well as others, are founded in, dependent upon, and grow out of, the legi&s;lative.</P>
<P>All other powers, therefore, <HI>the &s;upreme executive not excepted,</HI> are to look up to this, and to realize that they can, <HI>con&s;tituti|onally, do no one thing or act,</HI> in the admini&s;tration of govern|ment, but what is founded in the laws actually made by, and con&s;i&s;tent with the powers ve&s;ted in, the legi&s;lative. So that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though the con&s;titution hath ve&s;ted the pre&s;i|dent and &s;enate of the United States, with the general power of <HI>making treaties:</HI> yet this power, at highe&s;t, is but a &s;ubordi|nate power; and whenever a&s;&s;umed or carried beyond the laws of the land, or to the &s;ubver&s;ion or infringement of the powers, by the people in &s;ocial compact, ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lative, in the formation of treaties; &s;uch treaties are &s;ubver&s;ive of them&s;elves, and, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> null and void. And this, we humbly conceive, (in a degree at lea&s;t) is the truth of fact, in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution, the congre&s;s, as &s;upreme legi&s;lative of the United States, is ve&s;ted with power&mdash;"To regulate com|merce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and with the Indian tribes:"&mdash;"To e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of naturalization:"&mdash;"To lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, &amp;c."&mdash;"To <HI>de&s;ine</HI> and puni&s;h piracies and felonies committed on the high &s;eas:"&mdash;"To make rules concerning captures on land and water:"&mdash;To grant and appropriate monies, as it is expre&s;sly declared, that "no monies &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury, but in con&s;equence of appropriations made by law."</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="028389_0329_0FD8EA5ACF2BBE48">
Each of the&s;e powers, ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in congre&s;s, as the &s;upreme legi&s;lative of the United States, appear to us to have been a&s;&s;umed, infringed, violated, or &s;uper&s;eded, in various in&s;tances, by the general principles, particular articles, or &s;pecial regulations of the treaty before us.&mdash;For &s;atisfaction and proof, we beg leave to refer to the following articles, viz. the 2d, 3d, 9th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 21&s;t, in each of which, one or other of the above mentioned powers, ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, as the &s;upreme legi&s;lative of the United States, ob|viou&s;ly appears to have been a&s;&s;umed, infringed, violated or &s;uper&s;eded, as well as by general principles in the treaty at large.</P>
<P>Upon the whole&mdash;upon the mo&s;t careful attention to, and the mo&s;t mature, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and candid con&s;ideration of, the treaty before us, we are of opinion, That it is unequal, im|politic and unju&s;t; that it is degrading to the dignity of an in|dependent nation, and, in its tendency, to the rights, the pri|vileges, the property, and pro&s;perity of the United States: And that as we have hitherto been, to a great degree, happy and pro&s;perous, without any treaty with Britain &s;ince the peace, &s;o we &s;hould much &s;ooner prefer no treaty of this kind, or even a return to a &s;tate of colonization, than the adoption of this.</P>
<P>The foregoing report, being read and attentively con&s;idered, was unanimou&s;ly adopted by the town.</P>
<P>Voted, That the proceedings of the town be pre&s;ented to his excellency the governor and the honorable the council, re|que&s;ting them to call the general court together, as &s;oon as con|venient, to con&s;ider the &s;ubject of the treaty, and to do or act upon it, as in their great wi&s;dom they &s;hall think meet. Al&s;o,</P>
<P>Voted, That the Reverend Jonas Clark be reque&s;ted to take the charge of the proceedings of the town upon the treaty, and pre&s;ent them to his excellency the governor.</P>

<P>WE, the citizens of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mond county, being a&s;&s;embled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the court-hou&s;e &s;quare, in the town of Augu&s;ts, and having taken into our &s;erious con&s;ideration the treaty lately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tered into between the United States and Great Britain, &s;ay that by recurring to the me&s;&s;age of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ident of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> States, at the time of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Mr. Jay, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the object of his appointment was "a friendly adju&s;tm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of our claims." And that "going immediately from the United States, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch an envoy will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ry with him a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the exi&s;ting temper and &s;en&s;ibility of our country; and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be taught to vindicate our rights with firmne&s;s, and to culti|vate peace with &s;incerity."</P>
<P>This appointment took place when a bill was before con|gre&s;s, for re&s;training the intercour&s;e with that nation; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> object of an extraordinary mi&s;&s;ion to the court of London, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declared in the me&s;&s;age, embracing the &s;ubjects which gave ri&s;e to the bill, the &s;ame was relinqui&s;hed in favor of the exe|cutive proceedings&mdash;and America waited, with patience, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;ult. This has been a proceeding &s;tiled a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, &s;igned in London by Mr. John Jay and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter for that purpo&s;e, in November la&s;t, and &s;ince approved by the &s;enate of the United States, with an ex|ception as to the 12th article.</P>
<P>And it appears to us, that the treaty &s;o entered into, does not corre&s;pond with the objects of this appointment; or that it is calculated to promote the pro&s;perity of the country which made it. On the contrary, it appears, that the envoy lo&s;t &s;ight of the cau&s;es which were declared to lead to his appointment,
<PB N="47" REF="028389_0334_0FD8EA67F8B18CC0">and to have &s;ub&s;cribed to engagements &s;uited to the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances of England, only.</P>
<P>To &s;ee, and to be convinced of the&s;e truths, it is only nece&s;&s;a|ry to have recour&s;e to this in&s;trument it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ba&s;is of all national treaties, reciprocity of intere&s;t, has been laid a&s;ide; and our commerce put under the controul of England.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t Indies, it is to exi&s;t only by her guardian&s;hip and direction. To the We&s;t Indies we may go in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, until &s;he &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to recon&s;ider the &s;tate of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that quarter.</P>
<P>Her fleets and armies may commit any depredations upon our coa&s;ts and &s;ea-ports; and no repri&s;als can take place until a plaintive demand is made, and a tedious negociation gone through, in which &s;he would have time to fa&s;ten upon all the &s;trong holds of the union.</P>
<P>We are re&s;trui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed from allowing any favor to other nations, without extending them to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; and &s;everal articles of com|merce are declared to be contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d, which are contracted to be otherwi&s;e by exi&s;ting treaties. So that, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, we cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">or tho&s;e to whom we are indebted and ineli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed; nor, in the &s;econd, fulfil our &s;olemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; by which we make the world our en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ies for the preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> favor of England.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the treaty of peace, in re&s;pect to the removed negroes, has been relinqui&s;hed; and compen&s;ation for the &s;poliations complained of, is made to depend on a dilatory proce&s;s, and the uncertainty of chance: while future captures and detentions are made lawful.</P>
<P>The tribunals of ju&s;tice are cen&s;ured in general terms; and made the ground of &s;uper&s;eding their authority by a commi&s;&s;i|oner of chance, which may involve &s;ome of the &s;tates in mil|lions of expen&s;e.</P>
<P>Privateers giving &s;ecurity in an incon&s;iderable &s;um, will &s;carcely re&s;train them. It will rather be a licen&s;e for capture, by &s;ubjecting them to the penalty only, in taking the riche&s;t ve&s;&s;els; nor does it appear, that &s;uch &s;ecurity could be availed by an American citizen.</P>
<P>Even the exception to the 12th article, has been partially made; for it appears, that the &s;enate has approved the whole of the treaty, except &s;o much of that article "as re&s;pects the trade which his maje&s;ty hereby con&s;ents may be carried on be|tween the United States and his i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, in the manner and on the terms and conditions therein &s;pecified." So that the other part of the &s;ame article, which prohibits
<PB N="48" REF="028389_0335_0FD8EA690D088088">the exportation of cotton from the United States, is not in|cluded in the exception.</P>
<P>This is particularly injurious to this &s;tate; for the cultivation of cotton has become, within the&s;e few years, one of the great|e&s;t conveniencies to the citizens; and the improvements in machinery are extending its cultivation. It is light and porta|ble; and is the article mo&s;t conveniently carried to market, to obtain foreign nece&s;&s;aries. A prohibition to export it would, therefore, be &s;en&s;ibly felt; and may have a direct tendency to di&s;affect the minds of the people to the general government.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that it may be exported in Briti&s;h bottoms. Admit this, and the injury is increa&s;ed by the addition of in|&s;ult. To be re&s;trained from exporting the produce of our own fields, in our own ve&s;&s;els, is to &s;ubmit, not to treat.</P>
<P>In fact, if this treaty is ratified, and its &s;everal parts allow|ed to operate, as the &s;upreme law of the land, e&s;&s;ential arti|cles of the con&s;titution will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the nece&s;&s;ity of a congre&s;s &s;uper&s;eded; any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of law, being infe|rior, would be u&s;ele&s;s and null.</P>
<P>It will remove the boundaries of the United States, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed by the definitive treaty, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of our independence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and they mu&s;t remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oat, unle&s;s again made by "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or more faithful negociators.</P>
<P>Should the troops be removed from the we&s;tern po&s;ts, which have hitherto been detained in violation of a former treaty, at the di&s;tant period of the &s;econd engagement, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjects are to remain, and to continue the &s;ee of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. This is an actual ce&s;&s;ion of the key of the lakes to the crown of England, and, with it, the trade of the &s;avage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> It is con&s;enting to e&s;tabli&s;h the Briti&s;h empire in the bo&s;om of the union, to the di&s;honor of our &s;overeignty, and at the ri&s;k of our &s;afety.</P>
<P>But we are di&s;gu&s;ted with the detail; and, in &s;hort, &s;uch are the conce&s;&s;ions to the crown of Great Britain, that, to the&s;e who recollect, or will review, the cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned in the decla|ration of our independence and &s;eparation from that nation, it will appear a&s;toni&s;hing, that &s;uch articles could ever have been &s;ub&s;cribed, in the &s;ame age, with the &s;ame king and nation, and in the name of the people who had profu&s;ely &s;hed their blood to &s;upport the former.</P>
<P>We cannot but con&s;ider, therefore, that, to ratify the &s;aid treaty, would be an abu&s;e of the mercies of Heaven, by who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing and protection we e&s;tabli&s;hed our liberty, indepen|dence, and government; an entire di&s;regard of the fate and welfare of our republican friends and allies, the French nation;
<PB N="49" REF="028389_0336_0FD8EA6FD6A4CC78">and an abandonment of the true intere&s;ts of the United States.</P>
<P>And we do &s;incerely and earne&s;tly recommend it to the pre|&s;ident of the United States, to withhold his &s;ignature from the &s;ame; a&s;&s;uring him of our affectionate attachment and confidence, and of our utmo&s;t reliance on his wi&s;dom, patri|oti&s;m, and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the foregoing proceedings be &s;igned by the committee, and tran&s;mitted, without delay, by the chairman, to the pre&s;ident of the United States, by land and water.</P>

<P>WITH the freedom of men who are &s;en&s;ible of their own rights, but with the &s;incere deference which true republicans mu&s;t ever pay to the con&s;titution which them&s;elves have framed, to the laws which them&s;elves have authorized, and to the chief magi&s;trate of their own choice; and with all that reverence and affection which Americans ju&s;tly owe to the man who has mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his important &s;ervices, his incorruptible integrity, and the wi&s;dom of his councils; we venture to expre&s;s to you the painful ap|prehen&s;ions and alarms which have been excited in our minds, by the peru&s;al of this treaty now pending between the United States and his Britannic maje&s;ty: having con&s;idered it with the mo&s;t careful attention, we are confirmed in our fears, that the ratification of it would prove ruinous, or highly injurious, to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of our country. Having not time to go into a lengthy detail of all the objections to which we think the treaty liable, we have contented our&s;elves with &s;tating a few on|ly of tho&s;e which have mo&s;t forcibly impre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves on our feelings, and this &s;tatement, put into the form of a report,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to Mr. Jay's Treaty, page 175.</NOTE> we tran&s;mit to you, with a full per&s;ua&s;ion that you will give it that weight and con&s;ideration which the rea&s;ons on which it is founded, may ju&s;tly merit. Confident as we are, that our fel|low citizens in other parts of the union, impelled by &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to our own, and actuated by motives purely patriotic, will, with equal re&s;pect to your &s;tation and to your per&s;on, come forward with like repre&s;entations: we conjure you to &s;u&s;pend, for a &s;hort time, at lea&s;t, the ratification of this in&s;trument, that the general &s;en&s;e of the community, if they &s;hould think proper to expre&s;s it, may be known on &s;o intere&s;ting a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing conviction with which your undeviating con|duct has ever in&s;pired us, of the rectitude of your mind, will not permit us to doubt, but that you will rejoice to avail your|&s;elf of the light which, from every &s;ource, may be thrown on an

<HEAD TYPE="sub">At a Superior Court, begun and held at Savannah, in and for the County of Chatham, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, <HI>1795,</HI> Judge <HI>Stith</HI> delivered the following Charge to the Grand Jury.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE GRAND JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved, with &s;incere plea&s;ure, the &s;pirited, firm, and patriotic mea&s;ures of my fellow citizens of this city, in oppo&s;ition to the pending treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, lately entered into between the United States and the king of Great Britain; an example &s;o truly laudable and nece&s;&s;ary, that, I have no doubt, it will be followed in each of our &s;i&s;ter counties.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject has been &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by abler hands, that I &s;hall forbear to enter into a detail of tho&s;e prominent features of humility and di&s;grace to the dignity of the American cha|racter, with which every article abounds. When it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that an envoy extraordinary &s;hould be deputed by the American republic to the court of London, and when the chief ju&s;tice of the United States was inve&s;ted with that im|portant appointment, we were flattered with the expectation, that he was expre&s;sly charged to demand of the Briti&s;h king, an
<PB N="53" REF="028389_0340_0FD8EA7CABDC1E70">unequivocal fulfilment of certain &s;tipulations in the treaty of peace, which that monarch had, contrary to good faith, ne|glected, and, indeed, refu&s;ed to comply with, and immediate and adequate compen&s;ation for flagrant violations of other &s;ti|pulations in the &s;aid treaty, and for the mo&s;t wanton and inju|rious depredations committed on our citizens, and their com|merce, by the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war and privateers, authorized and &s;anctioned by the Briti&s;h cabinet, in direct violation of the law of nations and the rights of neutrality. On any other ba&s;is, a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, with that nation, mu&s;t be felt as an in&s;ult to the American people. I have read this pernicious in&s;trument with attention, and with a mind, I tru&s;t, favorable to a ju&s;t e&s;timate of &s;uch advantages as might be derived to us from its adoption; but alas! widely devious from the public hope and expectations, to the American mind it pre&s;ents nothing but a di&s;honorable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our mo&s;t inveterate enemies, in&s;ult and injury to our warme&s;t friends and allies, and perhaps makes the fir&s;t in&s;tance in hi&s;tory, wherein, after a &s;pecial emba&s;&s;y for the particular purpo&s;e, a negociation between two independent nations has terminated by a treaty which contains not even a &s;olitary advantage to the party who made the application.</P>
<P>The &s;pirited re&s;olutions and addre&s;s of this city, and &s;imilar mea&s;ures in a &s;i&s;ter &s;tate, while they di&s;cover a proper re&s;pect for the government, at the &s;ame time evince a due attention on the part of the people, to the pre&s;ervation of their ine&s;timable privileges, and may, perhaps, be a mean of averting the evils which would inevitably re&s;ult from a ratification of the treaty.</P>
<P>If happily the pre&s;ident &s;hould withhold his a&s;&s;ent to it, there will yet remain this melancholy truth, that the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of the American people are pro&s;trated at the foot of a &s;ingle individual; and, however highly I may think of the virtues of that individual, yet, while human nature is frail, I &s;hall con&s;ider the tru&s;t too momentous to be confided even to him. It will then be our duty, as citizens, to enquire, what is the real &s;ource of this important evil, and by what means a repeti|tion of it may be avoided. I confe&s;s my&s;elf partial to, and a warm admirer of, our con&s;titution; but am not blind to its faults; among the greate&s;t of which is, the power given to the pre&s;ident, with the advice of two-thirds of the &s;enate, to make treaties with foreign nations, and its declaring &s;uch trea|ties to be the &s;upreme laws of the land. They ought then, &s;urely, to undergo a fair, open, and public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and be approved of with tho&s;e legi&s;lative forms and &s;olemnities, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the pa&s;&s;ing of other acts, before they a&s;&s;ume

<HEAD><HI>RESOLUTIONS</HI> Of a Meeting of the Citizens of <HI>Camden Town</HI> and <HI>Di&s;trict, (South Carolina)</HI> held at the Court-hou&s;e, on Saturday the 25th Day of July, a&s;&s;embled for the Purpo&s;e of con&s;idering the Treaty, lately agreed upon between the United States of Americe and the King of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a free and liberal communication of &s;enti|ments on the occa&s;ion, the following re&s;olutions were agreed to.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That it is the duty, as well as the right, of freemen, on all great public occa&s;ions, that concern the honor and welfare of the republic, to come forward and declare their &s;entiments, with freedom and firmne&s;s; to the end that tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with power, may be admo|ni&s;hed to u&s;e that power, only for the good of the people, who have placed it in their hands, and beware to violate the &s;acred tru&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="028389_0342_0FD8EA82B1054D18">
Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That the afore&s;aid treaty &s;trikes us, in every point of light, with a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation. It appears to us mean, &s;lavi&s;h, and ob&s;cure, no wi&s;e equally binding; but conferring all advantages on the one &s;ide, and impo&s;ing all re&s;traints on the other; degrading to the dignity of an independent republic, and in&s;ulting to the honor and &s;pi|rit of a brave and free people: And that we think it not only infamous in the&s;e re&s;pects, but utterly incompatible with our ju&s;t claims, rights, and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That Great Britain has always inva|riably pur&s;ued a policy ho&s;tile and in&s;idious to the United States, and that &s;he is now engaged in a war, dangerous to our in|dependence and exi&s;tence as a nation. Sound policy, therefore, as well as re&s;entment for pa&s;t and pre&s;ent injuries, &s;hould pow|erfully per&s;uade us to &s;eize on the moment of her pro&s;trated &s;trength and humbled ambition, to derive, from the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;ituation, terms, which, in more pro&s;perous circum|&s;tances, we might in vain expect from her ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That the treaty appears to us, in every &s;hape, calculated to di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e bands of affection and intere&s;t, which ought to connect us, in a friend&s;hip inviolate, with the people of France, a great and regenerated people, who cheri&s;h, in their utmo&s;t purity and ardour, tho&s;e &s;acred principles, which have laid the foundation of our freedom, in the blood of our deare&s;t citizens! The &s;ympathy of the&s;e prin|ciples, as well as gratitude for pa&s;t friendly and important &s;er|vices, &s;hould unite the two nations together, with a tie that it &s;hould be deemed criminal to touch.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That greater conce&s;&s;ions are made, by this treaty, in favor of Great Britain, than America, in any former period, could have been brought to con&s;ent to; and which, in her pre&s;ent promi&s;ing condition, &s;he mu&s;t di&s;dain to think of.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That it is the intere&s;t and duty of all nations to cultivate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and that we depre|cate the calamities and de&s;olation of war; but that war, with all its horrors, ought much to be preferred to peace, upon &s;uch di&s;graceful and di&s;honorable terms.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That we hold in high e&s;timation, our fellow citizen Pierce Butler, and the other nine minority mem|bers in the &s;enate, for their &s;teady and patriotic oppo&s;ition to the &s;aid treaty.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That Jacob Read, and the other nineteen &s;upporting members, by their endeavours to &s;addle the United States with the &s;aid dete&s;table treaty, have ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed
<PB N="56" REF="028389_0343_0FD8EA8816C3E568">them&s;elves, in our opinion, unworthy of any further public tru&s;t of republicans.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That the chairman do &s;ign the&s;e re&s;o|lutions, and that they be printed, to the intent that our ideas of the &s;aid treaty, and our opinion of its author, &s;upporters, and abettors, may be made known.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 24th, 1795.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. Backs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A VERY palpable mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tatement is made in the Gazette of the United States of the 21&s;t, relative to the pro|ceedings of the <HI>ten members</HI> of the &s;enate, who were oppo&s;ed to the treaty, on Mr. Guna's motion. The motion of Mr. Guna is as follows:</P>
<P>"Whereas it is alleged by divers American citizens, that negroes and other property, to a con&s;iderable amount, were car|ried away in contravention of the 7th article of the treaty of peace between the United States and his Britannic maje&s;ty:</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the &s;enate recommend to the pre&s;ident of the United States to renew, by friendly negociations with his &s;aid maje&s;ty, the claims of the American citizens to compen&s;a|tion for the negroes, and other property &s;o alleged to have been carried away; and in ca&s;e the di&s;agreement, that has hitherto exi&s;ted relative to the con&s;truction in this behalf, of the &s;aid article, cannot be removed by candid and amicable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, that it be propo&s;ed, as a mea&s;ure calculated to che|ri&s;h and confirm the good under&s;tanding and friend&s;hip, which it is de&s;ired may prevail between the two countries, that com|mi&s;&s;ioners, be appointed in the manner directed by the 6th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, con|cluded
<PB N="58" REF="028389_0345_0FD8EA8CCEE89EB0">between the United States and his &s;aid maje&s;ty, with authority to a&s;certain and decide, as well the interpretation of the 7th article, in this re&s;pect, as likewi&s;e the amount of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the alleged violation of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"But the &s;enate are of opinion, that <HI>the negociation on this &s;ubject &s;hould be di&s;tinct from, and &s;ub&s;equent to, that recommended by their act of the</HI> 24th <HI>in&s;tant, re&s;pecting the trade and intercour&s;e between the United States and his &s;aid maje&s;ty's i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies."</HI></P>
<P>On motion to divide this motion, and to agree to all that is contained from the word <HI>"whereas"</HI> to the word <HI>"&s;ame"</HI> at the end of the fir&s;t paragraph of the re&s;olution, the yeas and nays were required, and it pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative, yeas 27, nays 1.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the "virtuous ten" mu&s;t have been in favor of the re&s;olution, any thing in the Gazette of the United States to the contrary, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But let us proceed to the expo&s;ition of further untruth, and &s;how, that a motion was made by one of the <HI>vert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es, ten,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give <HI>real</HI> and not <HI>pretended</HI> effect to the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>A motion was made by Mr. Jack&s;on, to amend the la&s;t pa|ragraph of the motion under the con&s;ideration of the Senate viz&mdash;</P>
<P>"But the &s;enate are of opinion, that the negociation on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ubject &s;hould be di&s;tinct from, and &s;ub&s;equent to, that reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> mended by their act of the 24th in&s;tant, re&s;pecting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and intercour&s;e between the United States and his &s;aid maje&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies"&mdash;to read as follows:</P>
<P>"And the &s;enate are of opinion, that <HI>the negociation on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubject &s;hould be con&s;idered</HI> AS PART <HI>of the negociation recommen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> by their act of the</HI> 24th <HI>in&s;tant,</HI> re&s;pecting the trade and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> cour&s;e between the United States and his &s;aid maje&s;ty's i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in the We&s;t Indies."</P>
<P>Whereupon, an amendment, after the divi&s;ion of a motion, was objected to, as not being in order; and on an appeal to the pre&s;ident, it was by him determined in the affirmative.</P>
<P>And on the que&s;tion to agree to the amendment propo&s;ed, the yeas and nays were required, and it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative.</P>
<P>Yeas 11</P>
<P>Nays 17</P>

<P><PB N="59" REF="028389_0346_0FD8EA91532F0A90">
The public will be enabled to determine from the foregoing &s;tatement, how far they may rely on the truth and accuracy of the Gazette of the United States.</P>
<P>The virtuous ten were for exacting a rigid fulfilment of the treaty of peace; and were for making the compen&s;ation for negroes a part of the pre&s;ent treaty; but the heroes of the Gazette of the United States had different views; they wi&s;hed nothing appended to their darling brat, that &s;hould prevent it from receiving the warm embraces of Great Britain, and, therefore, wanted a di&s;tinct negociation on this &s;ubject. <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> creditors are comprehended in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> treaty; but ju&s;tice to <HI>American</HI> citizens was to be re&s;erved for future negociations, wholly di&s;tinct from the treaty of <HI>amity.</HI></P>
<P>When mutilated extracts and po&s;itive untruths, are thus attempted to be palmed upon the public, what are we to &s;up|po&s;e of a cau&s;e, that mu&s;t be &s;upported by &s;uch means? The treaty it&s;elf is the be&s;t commentary upon the views of the ma|jority of the &s;enate; and no attempt whatever can po&s;&s;ibly &s;uc|ceed, with the treaty before our eyes, to le&s;&s;en "the virtuous ten" in the e&s;timation of the people of the United States. They have acted the part of patriots; they have &s;corned to make their country tributary to Great Britain; and the people from New Hamp&s;hire to Georgia will be their eulogi&s;ts. As faithful and upright &s;ervants of the people, the people will do full ju&s;tice to their merits, and every &s;uch attempt, as that made in the Gazette of the United States, mu&s;t bring di&s;grace and con|tempt upon the author.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="028389_0347_0FD8EA930FFBEF28">&s;wini&s;h multitude" that the ringleaders of this cur&s;ed bu&s;i|ne&s;s, are blinded by partiality and hatred; and that they, ever &s;ince 1775, have been prejudiced again&s;t our new, I mean our <HI>old</HI> friends, the Briti&s;h. To begin then at the fouth; there is that arch rebel, John Rutledge, many years a member of the old continental congre&s;s, in time of war; what better could be expected from him? is it yet forgotten, that when he was governor of South Carolina, and the Briti&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Charle&s;ton, his capital, that he hung all the Briti&s;h he could catch; as well as all &s;uch as would not a&s;&s;i&s;t him in fighting them? and don't you think he knows, that if the treaty takes place, and the Briti&s;h again bear rule, that they will hang him in turn; what better then could you expect from &s;uch a man as he? Self-pre&s;ervation, our par&s;on &s;ays, is nature's fir&s;t law: and if he knows, that the Briti&s;h will hang him if they come, is it not natural for him to try to prevent their coming? 'Tis true, our pre&s;ident did make him judge of the &s;upreme court of the United States; but he afterwards &s;uffered his own &s;tate to buy him off, by creating him their chief ju&s;tice with a high|er &s;alary. I hope, therefore, the people will not be influenced by the doings of &s;uch a man. As for old governor Matthews, his colleague, he is not a farthing better; for don't we all re|member how the Briti&s;h &s;ent him in irons to St. Augu&s;tine, and kept him &s;ix months in a dungeon, after Charle&s;ton was taken. Is it not, therefore, natural for him to thir&s;t for re|venge? In addition to all this, was be not known, during the whole war, in congre&s;s, and as governor of Carolina, to be among the mo&s;t inveterate enemies of the Briti&s;h? to &s;uch men, therefore, I hope the people will not tru&s;t; and though they a&s;&s;embled a large body of men in Charle&s;ton to oppo&s;e the treaty, you may depend on it, tho&s;e men hated the Bri|ti&s;h, as much as they did, and were all enraged Jacobins.</P>
<P>Then, again, there is Norfolk and Por&s;mouth in Virginia, they too have a&s;&s;embled, and expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the treaty. Now every body knows that, in the late war, tho&s;e towns were burnt by the Briti&s;h; is it not, therefore, natural for them to turn Jacobins, and endeavour to keep them out of their country, that they may not have a chance to burn their towns again? but all the world mu&s;t &s;ee, that this is an unju&s;tifiable prejudice, and all the world ought to be above the influence of it. As for Baltimore, has it not been the a&s;ylum of the French; they have an attachment to French principles, becau&s;e they are favorable to America. It is plain, therefore, as a pike &s;taff, that intere&s;t governs them, and that they are all Jacobins. Then for Philadelphia, though they have a&s;&s;embled in

<P>THE con&s;titution of the United States empowers the pre|&s;ident, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the &s;enate concur.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of a power thus ve&s;ted, the &s;enate of the United States did con&s;ent to and advi&s;e the pre&s;ident of the United States, to ratify the treaty of amity, commerce, and naviga|tion, between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States of America, concluded at London, the 19th of November, A. D. 1794; on condition, that there be added to &s;aid treaty an arti|cle, whereby it &s;hall be agreed to &s;u&s;pend the operation of &s;o much of the 12th article, as re&s;pects the trade which his &s;aid maje&s;ty thereby con&s;ents may be carried on between the United States and his i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, in the manner, and on the terms and conditions, therein pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>A copy of this treaty was &s;ent by Mr. Ma&s;on, one of the &s;enators from Virginia, to the editor of the Aurora, in Philadel|phia, that it might be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 7th of July, the editors of the Chronicle adverti&s;ed, in the Mercury, that a copy of the treaty before referred to, was brought by expre&s;s from Philadelphia, and was for &s;ale at their office, and at Larkin's book &s;tore, in Cornhill.</P>
<P>On the 8th of July, a notification, i&s;&s;ued by order of the &s;elect|men of Bo&s;ton, notifying the inhabitants to meet on the 10th, agreeably to the reque&s;t of a number of inhabitants, to take into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be deemed expedient, relative to the treaty pending between the United States and Great Britain.</P>
<P>On the 9th of July, the editors of the Chronicle publi&s;hed in their paper, the eight fir&s;t articles of the treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="028389_0349_0FD8EA9ACC4FBFA8">
The foregoing was the only publication of the treaty, prior to the meeting of the inhabitants on the 10th, except a publica|tion of its &s;uppo&s;ed contents, by &s;ome one who had read it, and which, on compari&s;on with Mr. Ma&s;on's copy, appears to be incorrect.</P>
<P>On the 10th, the inhabitants met in Faneuil Hall, where, 1500 of the citizens, without reading the treaty there, voted their di&s;approbation, and not one appeared in favor of it.</P>
<P>A committee of fifteen was appointed, "to report the rea|&s;ons, in writing, which led to the di&s;approbation of the treaty."</P>

<P>A concurrence of two-thirds of the number pre&s;ent was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a vote of the &s;enate on this &s;ubject; and it is under&s;tood, that this majority included all the &s;enators from New England (except Mr. Langdon, of Port&s;mouth, and Mr. Robin&s;on, of Vermont) one &s;enator from New York, all from New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, one from Kentucky, one from South Carolina, and one from Georgia.&mdash; Virginia and North Carolina were the only &s;tates in the union, who&s;e &s;enators were unanimous again&s;t its ratification.</P>

<P>Duty of our&s;elves demands that we &s;hould re&s;pect the legal and con&s;titutional doings of tho&s;e we have appointed to ad|mini&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur public affairs; at lea&s;t &s;o far as not to declare to the world, "That their acts are highly injurious to the com|mercial intere&s;ts of the United States, derogatory to the na|tional honor and independence, and may be dangerous to the peace and happine&s;s of their citizens,"&mdash;without the mo&s;t care|ful inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubjects, and without the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial rea&s;ons in &s;upport of charges which &s;o deeply wound the honor of the government, and the character of tho&s;e who have con&s;titutionally done the act, thus boldly accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Men who love their country, will endeavour to &s;upport its government, at lea&s;t will refrain from gro&s;sly criminating its conduct, until they have been convinced that no good rea&s;ons can be offered, for that which to them may at fir&s;t appear doubtful.

Men who know the value of character, from a ju&s;t regard of their own&mdash;who have &s;en&s;ibility duly to appreciate the worth of public &s;ame&mdash;will be cautious how they attempt to inflict a wound on the reputation of others, which, if aimed at them&s;elves, would produce the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The town of Bo&s;ton has given its rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;ertions which have &s;o deeply wounded the honor of the government; and which a&s;&s;ertions, if true, mu&s;t extremely weaken the confidence of the people in the &s;uperiority of their own con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Permit, therefore, Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell, a fellow citizen, through the medium of your paper, to examine the &s;olidity of their rea&s;ons, in proof that this declaration, that "the treaty, if ratified, will be highly injurious to the commercial intere&s;ts of the United States, derogatory to their national honor and in|dependence, and may be dangerous to the peace and happine&s;s of their citizens."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, "This compact (meaning the treaty) profe&s;&s;es to have no reference to the merits of the complaints and pre|ten&s;ions of the contracting parties; but in reality the complaints and preten&s;ions of Great Britain are fully provided for, while a

<P>The words of the treaty are, that "the parties being de&s;irous, by a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, to terminate their differences, in &s;uch a manner, as (without reference to the merits of their re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions) may be the be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding." The words of the treaty are copied here, that, by comparing them with the fir&s;t rea&s;on of the town, the public may judge of their true import, and not be induced to bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve, that the two nations met together, with the de&s;ign of terminating their differences, and, at the &s;ame time, di&s;re|garded the real &s;ubjects of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>The great charge in this rea&s;on is, that the complaints and preten&s;ions of Great Britain are fully provided for, while a part only of tho&s;e of the United States have been brought in|to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It is to be pre&s;umed, that the committee meant here, that the mini&s;ter on the part of America, never brought into con|&s;ideration all the complaints and preten&s;ions of his country. Becau&s;e, if brought into con&s;ideration, and proved to be un|founded, or, for any rea&s;on, waved, it could not be expected, that &s;uch con&s;ideration, or the rea&s;ons which refuted the com|plaints, &s;hould appear in the treaty; it would be u&s;ele&s;s and unprecedented.</P>
<P>That the American mini&s;ter did not bring them into con&s;i|deration, is an a&s;&s;umption of a fact by the committee, for which they have not given any evidence.</P>
<P>If the corre&s;pondence and arguments u&s;ed by the mini&s;ter who negociated the treaty, were before the town, or the com|mittee&mdash;or if they had &s;uch information of their doings, as could be relied on&mdash;it would probably have been &s;tated. Can|dour requires, that before a charge of gro&s;s neglect is believed again&s;t any man, &s;ome evidence &s;hould be adduced to &s;upport the charge.</P>
<P>That every complaint and preten&s;ion of the United States was duly made and enforced by the American mini&s;ter, is to be pre&s;umed from his known fidelity, under&s;tanding, and patriot|i&s;m. It may al&s;o be inferred from the following con&s;idera|tions:</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident of the United States undoubtedly gave him in&s;tructions on this head. The report made of the negocia|tion, would &s;how whether any thing was neglected on the part of the United States. This report was probably before the &s;enate.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="028389_0352_0FD8EAA50F86E638">
It is not pre&s;umable, that the pre&s;ident would accept the re|port of his mini&s;ter as &s;atisfactory, or con&s;ider the negocia|tion as completed, unle&s;s every matter of importance was brought into con&s;ideration; or that the &s;enate would recom|mend to the pre&s;ident, to ratify a treaty that was to terminate all differences, where it appeared to them that the complaints of our own country were not brought into con&s;ideration. Further, it is not probable, that the minority of the &s;enate, who had before them the whole negociation, would have ne|glected to &s;tate this, if it had exi&s;ted, as a rea&s;on for rejecting the treaty; whereas, in the communication made by Mr. Ma|&s;on, no &s;uch charge appears, nor in the motions of Mr. Taze|well and Mr. Burr. It may, therefore, fairly be inferred, until the town or its committee plea&s;e to give &s;ome evidence to the contrary, that every complaint and preten&s;ion of the United States, was brought into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e, in the &s;tipulation which &s;urrenders our po&s;ts on the we&s;tern frontiers, no provi&s;ion is made to indemnify the United States, for the commercial and other lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;tained, and the heavy expen&s;es to which they have been &s;ubjected, in con&s;equence of being kept out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for twelve years, in direct violation of the treaty of peace."</P>
<P>In this rea&s;on, the town mu&s;t intend that no treaty &s;hould be acceded to, unle&s;s the Briti&s;h nation would fir&s;t agree to indemnify the United States for all lo&s;&s;es, that aro&s;e from our not being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts the la&s;t twelve years.</P>
<P>This would be on the part of Great Britain to acknowledge that the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, was entirely her fault&mdash;This is probably a matter, &s;he would di&s;pute; and we are in candour obliged to acknowledge, that the 4th article of that treaty, which relates to payment of debts, was oppo&s;ed by &s;ome of the &s;tates very &s;oon after, if not before the de|finitive treaty was &s;igned; and that it continued unexecuted in &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates, until the federal government was e&s;tabli&s;hed. If &s;he can ju&s;tly impute the fir&s;t breach to the United States, our claim of indemnity, for her violation, mu&s;t be doubtful.

<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE third rea&s;on of the town of Bo&s;ton again&s;t ratify|ing the treaty, is, becau&s;e no indemnification is to be made to the citizens of the United States for property taken from them at the clo&s;e of the war, the re&s;titution of which is provided for by the &s;ame treaty.</P>
<P>The words of the treaty of 1783, referred to by the town, are probably the&s;e, "His Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all con|venient &s;peed, and without cau&s;ing any de&s;truction, or carry|ing away any negroes, or other property of the American in|habitants, withdraw all his armies," &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is under&s;tood, that the United States contend, that this de&s;cription applies to negroes, remaining within the Briti&s;h lines after the peace, but who, having been captured, or in|vited by proclamation, had fled to the Briti&s;h during the war. The Briti&s;h government contend for another con&s;truction, and &s;ay, that negroes captured in war, or who, invited by procla|mation, had taken refuge with them during the war, could be con&s;idered as American property, no more than &s;hips taken, or hor&s;es &s;trayed to them during the war. That, on the capture of negroes by the Briti&s;h, or the acceding by the negroes to the terms of their proclamation, they cea&s;ed to be the property of the Americans.</P>
<P>If this rea&s;oning of the Briti&s;h be not &s;atisfactory to the people of the United States, candour will oblige them to ad|mit, that the Briti&s;h government may think it ju&s;t, and con|&s;equently, a point extremely hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to be ob|tained from them, &s;ince the conce&s;&s;ion would imply a &s;acrifice of the public faith, which had been pledged to the negroes. It is not known, that the Briti&s;h carried away other property.</P>
<P>The amount in value, depending on this point, is greatly exaggerated, having been &s;tated, in conver&s;ation, at many millions of dollars; while it is known, from authentic docu|ments, that the whole number of negroes, to whom the pro|vi&s;ions in the treaty could po&s;&s;ibly relate, fall &s;hort of 3000, that being the total carried away after the peace, including many free negroes, and many &s;laves, who, with their proper ma&s;ters, had taken refuge within the Briti&s;h lines. Let any man make the probable deduction for free negroes, and tho&s;e &s;laves who accompanied their ma&s;ters, and con&s;ider that the remainder included tho&s;e of extreme old age, and the younge&s;t infants, the &s;ick and the well, the worthle&s;s, and tho&s;e of va|lue, and he mu&s;t be convinced, however un&s;atisfactory the con|&s;truction given by the Briti&s;h may be to his mind, that the evil
<PB N="68" REF="028389_0355_0FD8EAAE2586B080">is not of great magnitude, by no means &s;ufficient to pre&s;s an indemnity for, in hazard of the property taken from our citi|zens on the ocean, in hazard of our peace, and other articles of the treaty, which may be con&s;idered beneficial to the United States.</P>
<P>The fourth rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e the capture of ve&s;&s;els and property of the citizens of the United States, made under the authority of the government of Great Britain, is a national concern; and claims, ari&s;ing from &s;uch captures, ought not to have been &s;ubmitted to the deci&s;ion of their admiralty courts; as the United States are thereby precluded from having any voice in the final determination of &s;uch ca&s;es, and becau&s;e the indemnification propo&s;ed to be made, is to be &s;ought by a proce&s;s, tedious and expen&s;ive, in which ju&s;tice may be delayed to an unrea&s;onable time; and eventually lo&s;t to many of the &s;ufferers, from their inability to pur&s;ue it; and becau&s;e this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the &s;ummary method adopted for the &s;atisfaction of Briti&s;h claims."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge here is, that claims ari&s;ing from captures made on American property ought not to have been &s;ubmitted to the deci&s;ion of their admiralty courts.</P>
<P>In the year 1753, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia complained to the king of Great Britain, that the property of his &s;ubjects had been unlawfully captured and condemned on the high &s;eas, by &s;ub|jects of the king of Great Britain. The reply then was, that the property had been regularly tried in the admiralty courts of Great Britain, which courts tried cau&s;es according to the univer&s;al law of nations, and the &s;tipulations of treaty; that affairs of this kind are and can be cognizable only in the courts belonging to that power where the &s;eizure is made.</P>
<P>In our own country, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter complained to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that certain &s;ubjects of his king were injured by an inability to obtain their ju&s;t demands.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on replied, "that no nation can an&s;wer for per|fect exactitude of proceedings in all their inferior courts&mdash;it &s;uffices to provide a &s;upreme judicature, where error and par|tiality will be ultimately corrected. With this qualification, we have heretofore been in the habit of con&s;idering the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice in Great Britain, as extremely pure. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is a branch of the &s;overeignty over a country, and belongs exclu&s;ively to the nation inhabiting it&mdash; When a cau&s;e has been adjudged, according to the rules and forms of the country, its ju&s;tice ought to be pre&s;umed.&mdash;If any in&s;tances of unlawful impediments have exi&s;ted in any of
<PB N="69" REF="028389_0356_0FD8EAAF9702BF40">the inferior tribunals, they would, like other unlawful proceed|ings, have been over-ruled on an appeal to the higher courts. If not over-ruled, then a complaint to the government would have been regular, and their interference probably effectual. If your citizens would not pro&s;ecute their rights, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould recover them, or be denied recovery: and, un|til a denial of right through all the tribunals, there is no ground of complaint."</P>
<P>Here it appears, that, in other ca&s;es, and with other nati|ons, this has been thought ju&s;t by Great Britain: and, in our own country, the doctrine has been adopted towards Great Britain, and acquie&s;ced in on her part.</P>
<P>It ought likewi&s;e to be remarked, that mo&s;t of the &s;eizures complained of by the American citizens, have been made by privateers owned by private individuals; and that every Briti&s;h &s;ubject has a right, which neither king nor mini&s;ter can de|prive him of, to have his cau&s;e tried by the courts of his country; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ome claims may have been made by Americans, where the property is liable, by the law of nations, to be condemned. It ought al&s;o to be remem|bered, that the Briti&s;h government made provi&s;ion for the re|gular bringing forward to trial, cau&s;es, which, from certain circum&s;tances of the claimants, had, by &s;trict law, lo&s;t their right to a trial in the &s;upreme courts of admiralty; and that our own government has &s;ent a per&s;on to procure papers and documents from the courts of vice admiralty, to &s;upport the claims of our citizens; to enter appeals, and give &s;ecurity for their pro&s;ecution, free of expen&s;e, to the claimants. The trial by admiralty courts is &s;upported, alluded to, and enforced by many treaties. "In this method, all captures at &s;ea have been tried, during all the late wars, by the European powers, and &s;ubmitted to by the neutral powers. By courts of admiralty, acting according to the laws of nations, and particular trea|ties, all captures at &s;ea have immemorially been judged of, in every country of Europe; any other method of trial would be manife&s;tly unju&s;t, ab&s;urd, and impracticable." Thus the law and cu&s;toms of nations have been &s;tated by the able&s;t and mo&s;t re|&s;pectable civilians of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be inferred, that the evils of the unfortunate people, who&s;e property has been captured, will be redre&s;&s;ed, in a manner known and practi&s;ed by other nations, in &s;imilar ca&s;es, and recognized as right by our&s;elves;&mdash;that the injuries, apprehended by the town for the &s;ufferers, from the expen&s;e attending the &s;uits, and their incapacity to pur&s;ue their claims, have been fully provided for by the American government.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="028389_0357_0FD8EAB109351228">
To provide again&s;t evils which this method might not reach, it is expre&s;sly warranted, in the 7th article of the treaty, "that in all ca&s;es where adequate compen&s;ation cannot, for whatever rea&s;on, be now actually obtained, had, and received, by the &s;aid merchants and others, in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, full and complete compen&s;ation for the &s;ame, will be made by the Briti&s;h government to the &s;aid complainants."</P>
<P>The other part of the charge, contained in this rea&s;on, is, that the mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the &s;ummary one adopted for the &s;atisfaction of Briti&s;h claims.</P>
<P>The &s;ame 7th article of the treaty &s;tipulates, that the de|claration of the pre&s;ident, as contained in Mr. Jeffer&s;on's let|ter, of the 5th of September, 1793, to Mr. Hammond, &s;hall be carried into execution. This letter, which is annexed to the treaty, &s;tates, that having, for particular rea&s;ons, forborne to u&s;e all the means in the power of the United States, for the re&s;titution of certain ve&s;&s;els, the pre&s;ident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compen&s;ation therefor.</P>
<P>The government of the United States, voluntarily forbear|ing to make u&s;e of all the means in their power to obtain ju&s;|tice for certain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, is certainly a different ca&s;e from captures by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, of American property, on which the Briti&s;h government expre&s;sly &s;tipulates, that &s;he will make u&s;e of all the means in her power to obtain re&s;titution from the captors, of property wrongfully taken; and, if the&s;e means are inadequate, from whatever rea&s;on, &s;he will make full and complete compen&s;ation to the complainants. The American government having decided, that the demand of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter was right, cho&s;e between two evils, viz. That of compelling re&s;titution from the wrong-doer when in their power, or making compen&s;ation it&s;elf.&mdash;It cho&s;e the latter.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h government cho&s;e the former; and Mr. Jeffer&s;on declares, in the letter before referred to, "that where all the means in the power of the nation are u&s;ed to obtain re&s;titu|tion, and they fail; he did not mean to give an opinion, that re&s;titution ought to be made by the government;" but, in this ca&s;e, Mr. Jay has induced the Briti&s;h government to u&s;e all the means in their power, and make compen&s;ation, when the&s;e fail.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, that a reference to the article in the treaty, Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter, and a con&s;ideration of the law of nations, as recognized by Europe and America, will convince all candid men, that the fourth rea&s;on of the town ought to have no weight again&s;t the treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028389_0358_0FD8EAB664D83488">
The fifth rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e this compact admits Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to an equal participation with our own citizens, of the interior traffic of the United States with the Indians, through our whole territorial dominions, while the advantages o&s;ten&s;ibly reciprocated to our citizens, are limited both in their nature and extent."</P>
<P>It hath been well under&s;tood, by men acquainted with the country, occupied by the Indians, within the territory of the United States, and that which falls within the Briti&s;h dominions, that by far the greate&s;t proportion of furs are collected within the Briti&s;h dominions. If this is true, much is gained to the United States by the fur trade, while Britain has nothing in return, but the liberty of traver&s;ing a wilderne&s;s, from which no traffic can be obtained. A little reflection will convince us, that our means of paying for &s;uch furs, and our export trade, opened by this treaty, are really &s;uperior to the benefits de|rived to Britain, and will prove a &s;ource of great wealth to the Americans.</P>
<P>While we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an extent of &s;ea coa&s;t, &s;o immen&s;e, compared with that of Great Britain, it will readily be &s;een, that the European and A&s;iatic goods (the latter of which can be afforded on better terms by us, than the &s;ubjects of Great Britain) exported from the United States, into their interior countries, mu&s;t greatly exceed any quantities the Briti&s;h colo|ni&s;ts can bring into the United States on that quarter. The embarra&s;&s;ments attending an importation from Europe into Ca|nada, New Brun&s;wic, and Nova Scotia, by &s;ea, and confined as tho&s;e inhabitants of the countries are in their trade to the mother country, compared with our advantages of &s;upplying them, by our ea&s;y communication with them, and with every part of the world, will convince all candid men, that the ad|vantages, of this part of the treaty, are chiefly on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>But &s;till it may be &s;aid, they have a right to come into our country, and we have not a right to enter the &s;eaports of their colonies in our own ve&s;&s;els. If it appears from an examination of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the article of the trea|ty here referred, to that we receive more than we grant, it mu&s;t be admitted that this rea&s;on ought not to prevail again&s;t a ratification of the treaty.</P>
<P>By the treaty we are equally admitted into each other's terri|tory on the land board, for the purpo&s;es of traffic. Before the treaty is ratified, neither enjoys this right. They enter our &s;ea|ports as freely now, as they can by the treaty&mdash;we are not per|mitted to enter theirs. This in&s;trument gives them no new right on the &s;ea board. It does not dimini&s;h any we po&s;&s;e&s;s. Under
<PB N="72" REF="028389_0359_0FD8EAB86FEACCC8">the treaty, we can carry on commerce with their colonies by land. From rea&s;ons before &s;tated, our trade there mu&s;t be very advantageous, while theirs in our territory cannot be di&s;advan|tageous.</P>
<P>By this article, therefore, it appears we have gained much, for which we have given but little, if any thing; for none will pretend, that by the means of the lakes, the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts can under-&s;ell the American merchant; &s;till le&s;s will any pre|tend that we do not gain immen&s;ely more of the fur trade than we grant.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e the alien duty upon our mer|chandize, imported into the United States by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, in their own bottoms, is, if not wholly &s;u&s;pended, at lea&s;t con|tracted not to be increa&s;ed."</P>
<P>The 15th article of the treaty contains a &s;tipulation of both parties, that places their &s;hips and merchandizes reciprocally on the footing of the mo&s;t favored nations, and merely re&s;erves a right to the Briti&s;h government, to impo&s;e on American ve&s;|&s;els, entering into Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to what Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els pay in American ports, and &s;uch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty, now payable on the importation of European and A&s;iatic goods, when imported into the United States, in Briti&s;h or in Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be the article to which the &s;ixth rea&s;on alludes&mdash; and it certainly cannot be "derogatory to our national honor and independence" to be willing to meet the Briti&s;h nation on terms of equality; when it is con&s;idered, that we have &s;imilar articles in our treaties with France, the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Pru&s;&s;ia; that it is common in mo&s;t of the mo|dern treaties, and e&s;pecially was of late in&s;erted in the treaty between France and Great Britain; at lea&s;t, it behoves tho&s;e who make the objections, to &s;how in what con&s;i&s;ts our power to compel a nation to trade with us, on terms by which we &s;hall impo&s;e heavier duties on her trade, than we do on others, while &s;he impo&s;es no heavier duties on us, than &s;he does on others. In general terms, it has been &s;aid, that the treaty was not re|ciprocal &mdash;here is an objection, that it is reciprocal.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is re&s;pectfully conceived, that there are few points of objection to the treaty, which require a more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and full examination, than that which turns upon the omitted compen&s;ation for the negroes taken away in 1783. It is not pertinent to urge, as hath been done, in favor of an erroneous con&s;truction of the treaty of peace, that there is, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, no property in men. It is very unhappy, indeed, but it is al&s;o true, that the cen&s;us of 1791 proves the exi&s;tence of &s;uch property, as well in the <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>middle,</HI> as in the &s;outhern &s;tates; and that the laws of both the contracting nations, &s;till continue to maintain this property in men, in many parts of their re&s;pective dominions. Were a general manumi&s;&s;ion in|&s;tantly to take place, the able&s;t friends of the treaty will can|didly acknowledge, that <HI>political order,</HI> the be&s;t re&s;ult of hu|man wi&s;dom and virtue, would, for a long time, be bani&s;hed from our land.</P>
<P>Thus much has been &s;aid upon this point, becau&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of a local a&s;pect, and calculated to beget heat and to excite prejudices (which, though truly amiable, are unfavorable to fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion) have been occa&s;ionally made by writers on the treaty.</P>
<P>It is under&s;tood, that the Briti&s;h government have formerly, or recently urged the following objections to our allegations, that they fir&s;t infringed the treaty of peace by carrying away the negroes from New-York.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. They have ob&s;erved, as it is &s;aid, that it was an evident mi&s;con&s;truction of the treaty, and might even be deemed offen|&s;ive to them, to &s;ay that they had &s;tipulated to commit &s;uch a breach of faith, as their delivering up to &s;lavery, men, who had been induced among them by promi&s;es of protection and freedom.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="76" REF="028389_0363_0FD8EAC3C9EC0DE8">
2dly. That the negroes were property in America; that a part of them were taken in war by the Briti&s;h troops and were con&s;equently <HI>"booty"</HI> to them, and no longer the property of the American inhabitants; that the words of the &s;tipulation are, "Negroes and <HI>other property</HI> of the American inhabitants."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That another part of the negroes had come within their lines, and were to be con&s;idered <HI>"as &s;trays."</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. That the article concerning the negroes in the treaty of peace, might refer and apply to tho&s;e negroes which be|longed to the American inhabitants <HI>within the Briti&s;h lines.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;idering the&s;e an&s;wers, which, it is &s;incerely meant, &s;ir, to &s;tate fairly, a great incon&s;i&s;tency occurs between the fir&s;t and third rea&s;on. In the fir&s;t rea&s;on it is alleged, that the negroes were <HI>induced</HI> (i. e. <HI>led</HI>) within the Briti&s;h lines; that is, that they went thither for an object <HI>aforethought;</HI> for an object <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to them, for an object <HI>previou&s;ly de&s;ired</HI> by them, for an object, which was <HI>&s;o well under&s;tood between the parties,</HI> that it could not be taken away, con&s;i&s;tently with the maxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of one of them, concerning morals, faith, and policy. But in the <HI>third</HI> rea&s;on, it is alleged, that &s;ome of the negroes were as <HI>"&s;trays"</HI> in the Briti&s;h camps and lines, though induced (<HI>led</HI> or <HI>attracted</HI>) thither by the &s;tronge&s;t allurements and in|fluences, though free human agents, at lea&s;t, in that particular; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing intellectual minds, knowing the places from which and through which they went, and whither, <HI>on reflection,</HI> they <HI>intended</HI> to go and did go, and at which places of de&s;tination, they <HI>accordingly &s;topt,</HI> and demanded the objects, for which they purpo&s;ely went thither, and that, too, upon the faith of pro|mi&s;es of the Briti&s;h commanders, which they had heard be|fore they left the places from which they are alleged to have <HI>"&s;trayed."</HI></P>
<P>But further, if any part of the negroes were <HI>"&s;trays"</HI> they were not <HI>"booty"</HI> taken in war by an enemy. Con&s;equently the property of the American inhabitants was not changed <HI>by capture.</HI> No capture had taken place, and they ought not to have been carried away from their owners. All &s;uch negroes mu&s;t have come within the words u&s;ed, which are, "<HI>any</HI> ne|groes or other property of the American inhabitants." Moreover as <HI>the re&s;toration of &s;trays,</HI> on paying charges, is dictated no le&s;s by common hone&s;ty and cu&s;tom, than by the treaty, it was but a &s;mall conce&s;&s;ion to that &s;pirit of ju&s;tice, friend&s;hip, and liberality, which was mutually profe&s;&s;ed at the &s;ettlement of peace.</P>
<P>The 4th rea&s;on will appear to be quite unfound. The article concerning the negroes was manife&s;tly intended to re&s;train the
<PB N="77" REF="028389_0364_0FD8EAC6120D8948">Briti&s;h forces from taking away certain objects. This could not have been propo&s;ed by the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner, but, indeed, required &s;ome delicacy to be brought forward by the American commi&s;&s;ioners, as it might convey an imputation or &s;u&s;picion of plunder again&s;t the Briti&s;h troops. It is material, &s;ir, that the mind &s;hould be &s;atisfied, that this article was demanded on the part of the United States, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be clear that the American commi&s;&s;ioners could not have meant by it, to bring forward a &s;tipulation to pre&s;erve the property of the ob|noxious American inhabitants, who were found within the Briti&s;h lines. <HI>It is equally clear, that the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner could not but con&s;ider it as an in&s;ult to him and his nation, if the Ameri|can commi&s;&s;ioners had required a formal promi&s;e, that their gene|rals and admirals &s;hould not de&s;poil the unfortunate people within their lines (in the moment of leaving them) of their negroes and other property.</HI> There is much &s;olicitude for the loyali&s;ts, manife&s;ted by the Briti&s;h government in the old treaty, but not for the negroes. A kind di&s;po&s;ition to them probably was not at all wanting; but in the variety and importance of other objects, they may have been overlooked by the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner at Paris. The fir&s;t attraction of attention to the &s;ituation of the&s;e negroes has probably been in New-York, where the promi&s;es of the generals and admirals, and of the officers commanding the black corps, brought the ca&s;e per&s;onally home to &s;ome of them, and the negroes them&s;elves would prove &s;trong, though &s;imple, remon&s;trants again&s;t the mea&s;ure. Their ca&s;e was &s;eri|ous and hard, and it was humane and prudent to let them go, under the idea of a compen&s;ation in money.</P>
<P>If it appears &s;atisfactorily rea&s;onable, that the article in que&s;tion, of the treaty of peace, could not be particularly in|tended to prevent the Briti&s;h from carrying away the negroes belonging to the people within their lines, then it will follow, that the &s;tipulation could have no meaning at all, unle&s;s it ap|plied to tho&s;e who had left their ma&s;ter's hou&s;es without the lines, and repaired to the Briti&s;h camps, or were picked up in the cour&s;e of their marches: That is, the &s;tipulation could have only applied to tho&s;e claimed by our government in all its de|partments and in every &s;tage of our affairs. It is held to be conclu&s;ive again&s;t any con&s;truction of a treaty, that &s;uch con|&s;truction involves <HI>"an ab&s;urdity;"</HI> and &s;urely it is perfectly irrational to make a &s;olemn &s;tipulation, which has no object to which it can apply or refer.</P>
<P>The words, <HI>"any negroes",</HI> are very explicit, and do not carry the idea of property at all. It was the duty of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner to have propo&s;ed a clear and definite exception
<PB N="78" REF="028389_0365_0FD8EAC811214CB8">of any portion of them to which he thought they had acquir|ed a title. Not doing &s;o, we have a right to the broad mean|ing of the word <HI>"any"</HI> The United States might con&s;ider the negroes in two divi&s;ions, one part as taken in war, and another part (the greate&s;t) as going voluntarily into the Briti&s;h lines. The property in the latter was not altered or affected by capture. They were, by the laws, <HI>"runaways."</HI> The <HI>ma&s;ter's legal right was not impaired.</HI> The words, "<HI>any</HI> negroes," would include <HI>both</HI> de&s;criptions, and the &s;ub&s;equent words, "other property," might follow, as a part, at lea&s;t, of the negroes con|tinued the property of American owners. Moreover; &s;ome of the negroes were taken upon the high &s;eas, and upon the bays of Che&s;apeake and Charle&s;ton; and, &s;ince the mo&s;t &s;trict ideas drawn from the laws of property and war are recurred to, it may be fair to &s;ay, that the property in them could not be changed, until after a regular trial and condemnation in a court of admiralty in each ca&s;e. This was done by the American privateer-owners, when they took negroes in their prizes, and was wanting, no doubt, in many ca&s;es in New-York. Tho&s;e negroes remained, therefore, the property of the American in|habitants.</P>
<P>When an expre&s;&s;ion, in &s;o &s;olemn and important an in&s;tru|ment as a treaty, is con&s;tructed and in&s;erted in the utmo&s;t la|titude (as "<HI>any</HI> negroes") it is dangerous to truth, to the har|mony of the contracting parties and to their peace, to narrow it down by inferences from <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> words. A &s;light relative inaccuracy in a following expre&s;&s;ion may de&s;troy the meaning, utility, and effect of language, the mo&s;t clear and unequivocal. In the in&s;tance before us, &s;ir, this really appears to be the ca&s;e. The words <HI>"other property"</HI> are made, by Great Britain, to narrow unduly the preceding words. Taking in all that has happened and all that was talked over, the pa&s;&s;age might have been fairly con&s;trued thus: all captured and runaway negroes and property of the American inhabitants.</P>
<P>The conduct of this government, at the moment of the fact, was attended with unanimity, was decided, and clear. Two opinions were not entertained upon the &s;ubject. A very able friend of the pending treaty (Mr. Hamilton, of New York) moved a re&s;olution on the 23d May 1783, in his place in con|gre&s;s, "that a con&s;iderable number of negroes, belonging to the citizens of the&s;e &s;tates, have been carried off <HI>contrary to the true intent and meaning of the &s;aid (preliminary) articles."</HI> This motion was &s;econded by Mr. Izard (of South Carolina) and carried without a divi&s;ion. Con&s;equent mea&s;ures were, at
<PB N="79" REF="028389_0366_0FD8EACBB311A778">the &s;ame time, adopted by congre&s;s to obtain &s;atisfaction from the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>Your own opinions and convictions, &s;ir, on this point, at that time, are generally under&s;tood to have been decided, that the carrying away the negroes, as it was done, was an infrac|tion of the treaty. Your own memory, &s;ir, your corre&s;pondence with congre&s;s and with the Briti&s;h commanders, and your in|&s;tructions to Mr. Ben&s;on, Lieutenant-colonel Smith, and Mr. Parker, the American commi&s;&s;ioners, place within your power the &s;ure means of a&s;certaining the ideas you entertained upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From the three un&s;ucce&s;sful motions in the &s;enate, made by Mr. Burr, Mr. Tanewell, and Mr. Gunn, which &s;everally had for their object further amicable negociation for the value of the negroes, and for one or the other of which three mo|tions <HI>every member</HI> of the &s;enate (except, it is believed, two who were &s;ick) voted, it may be con&s;idered as <HI>the unanimous opinion of the &s;enate,</HI> that <HI>this claim was not placed by the treaty, upon a ju&s;t and &s;atisfactory footing.</HI> But, &s;ir, the circum&s;tances preced|ing the treaty of peace, throw con&s;iderable light upon the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> meaning of the article relative to the negroes. It appears from the extracts and minutes in Mr. Jeffer&s;on's "Papers relative to Great Britain,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Carey's Edition, pages 100&mdash;103.</NOTE> which accompanied your me&s;&s;age to congre&s;s, of the 5th of December, 1793, that the American commi&s;&s;ion|ers at Paris, in 1782, had held up to the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner, general claims for negroes and other property carried away in the cour&s;e of the war from the &s;everal &s;eaports, which had been occupied, as po&s;ts, by the Briti&s;h forces. It appears, that the retro&s;pective claim was not u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">imurely admitted into the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ty; but this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with Mr. O&s;wald will go far &s;o convince an impartial judgment, that his ideas in the &s;tipulation again&s;t the further carrying away of negroes and other property, wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that no removal of the black people, who had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pated by the American inhabitants, was to be permitted by the Briti&s;h commanders, in the intended evacuation of New-York, wherein it was well known to both parties, that great num|bers were collected. Had this been refu&s;ed by the Briti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioner, without an offer of their value, it is ea&s;y to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ceive, that the American commi&s;&s;ioners would not have agreed to remove the <HI>lawful</HI> impediments to the recovering of the Briti&s;h debts. The United States would profit by a rigid ad|herence to &s;trictly legal ideas in the treaty of peace, becau&s;e all debts <HI>legally</HI> extingui&s;hed, had &s;o completely cea&s;ed to be
<PB N="80" REF="028389_0367_0FD8EACD886AE458"><HI>debts,</HI> that the fifth article could not apply to them. The&s;e were many.</P>
<P>But, &s;ir, the propriety of the Briti&s;h commanders holding the negroes taken on land as <HI>"booty,"</HI> admits of &s;ome ob&s;er|vation. Civilized nations do not now deem it proper, that their forces &s;hould take as booty, the property of private per&s;ons, not actually &s;ound in arms. It is not at all uncommon to pay individuals for hor&s;es, forage, fuel and provi&s;ions. The &s;hock|ing effects of the principle of <HI>"booty,"</HI> have been commuted for the more humane mea&s;ure of contribution. The war was of a peculiar character and nature; and for that and other rea&s;ons, it was not to be expected, that, in the moment of re|conciliation, Great Britain was to lo&s;e &s;ight of the&s;e ideas, nor that the would be governed by <HI>&s;ummum jus,</HI> in her &s;tipulations with the United States. Her agreement not to carry away any more negroes, was a mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;tent with "the liberal, manly, and candid manner" in which Mr. O&s;wald is declared, by Mr. Adams, Doctor Franklin, and Mr. Jay, to "have con|ducted the negociations for peace." It appears rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that a commi&s;&s;ioner, &s;o characterized, would be de&s;irous to remove from the final act of amicable &s;eparation, to which both parties had agreed, every thing which might wound the American feelings, or keep alive the painful &s;en&s;ibilities, which had re&s;ulted from the immen&s;e de&s;truction of an inva&s;ive war. He well knew, that the American commi&s;&s;ioners had repre&s;ent|ed the parts of this country which owed money to Great Bri|tain, as in &s;ome degree incapacitated from paying their debts, by the lo&s;s of the negroes, which had already been taken away: and though he might be aver&s;e to admit the large &s;chedule of lo&s;&s;es of which the negroes, <HI>previou&s;ly removed,</HI> formed a great part, he might naturally compromi&s;e the claim for the pa&s;t and for the pending, by agreeing in the mo&s;t latitudinary terms and ideas, that the troops of his nation &s;hould inoffen&s;ively and harmle&s;sly depart without carrying away "<HI>any</HI> negroes or other property of the American inhabitants." Upon critical re|flection, it will be perceived that this expre&s;&s;ion is not <HI>entirely</HI> wrong, though inaccurate, &s;eeing that there was one de&s;crip|tion of the general ma&s;s of negroes to be left, who are now admitted to be property <HI>by both parties:</HI> namely, tho&s;e belong|ing to the inhabitants within the lines.</P>
<P>Writers upon <HI>the interpretation of treaties</HI> may be properly con|&s;ulted upon this &s;ubject. They ju&s;tly admit us to rea&s;on from <HI>the general views of the contracting parties.</HI> The&s;e have been al|ready noticed in the preceding detail, and it is hoped, &s;ir, that the length and particularity of the &s;tatement will be excu&s;ed on
<PB N="81" REF="028389_0368_0FD8EACF36DE4B90">account of the great importance of the facts, as evidences of the highly probable or real views of the parties.</P>
<P>It is another rule of interpretation, that when late excep|tions are made, by a promi&s;ing party, to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive meaning of the words u&s;ed, he may be reminded, that he ought, at the time, to have modified the promi&s;e, by altering the expre&s;&s;ion. "<HI>Any</HI> negroes," including all without excep|tion, the party promi&s;ing cannot now narrow the meaning of tho&s;e words, by &s;ugge&s;tions from his own mind or by calling in a &s;ub&s;equent expre&s;&s;ion to limit the right of the United States.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a rule, that <HI>neither party has a right to interpret. a treaty as he plea&s;es.</HI> So that differing in their ideas, as the two governments do, the United States have <HI>a right</HI> to &s;ome equal mode of &s;ettling the claim. Two feigned ca&s;es, one to be tried in the highe&s;t court of each country, and to determine the matter in favor of that party which might prove &s;ucce&s;sful in both, are &s;ugge&s;ted with deference and &s;ome doubt. If the courts differed in their decrees, we &s;hould be, at lea&s;t, as well as we are. Commi&s;&s;ioners, with all the lights derived from the two hearings, might then terminate the matter. Now Great Britain <HI>pre&s;cribes</HI> the &s;en&s;e of the article contrary to our ideas, and, of cour&s;e, contrary to rule. (See Vattel, book 2. ch. 7.)</P>
<P>It is to be remembered, that the rules of interpretation, laid down in the law of nations, are con&s;idered as binding upon all rea&s;onable governments.</P>
<P>It has already been remarked, that every interpretation, which leads to ab&s;urdity, is to be rejected. On this rule, it may be further ob&s;erved, that it would be really ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner meant to avoid injury to the rai&s;ers of our produce, or that the American commi&s;&s;ioners meant to &s;ave the planters and farmers from being incapacitated from paying their debts, by re&s;training the carrying away of the few <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> &s;laves belonging to the people, re&s;iding in New-York.</P>

<P>IT is propo&s;ed, &s;ir, re&s;pectfully to offer to you, in this paper, &s;ome further reflections upon the article, in the treaty of peace with Great Britain, relative to the negroes.</P>
<P>It appears to be fair, in the con&s;truction of the treaty, to con&s;ider what would have been the effect of rea&s;oning, &s;imilar to that oppo&s;ed to the United States, if re&s;orted to in con&s;tru|ing other parts of the &s;ame in&s;trument. The <HI>American</HI> artillery was, by the &s;ame article, to be left in all the evacuated fortifica|tions. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, as was indeed really the ca&s;e, that the cannon, originally belonging to all the fortifications in America, had been ca&s;t in Europe. It might have been urged, that the&s;e were never <HI>American</HI> in one &s;en&s;e, and in another &s;en&s;e, that they had cea&s;ed to be American, having become Briti&s;h by cap|ture. Then the article about <HI>American</HI> artillery would have be|come ab&s;urd, for it would have been a formal &s;tipulation, with|out any object, to which it could apply. This ca&s;e is very &s;trong, becau&s;e the artillery appurtenant (in the &s;trict legal and orthographical &s;en&s;e of that word) to the fortifications, was originally the property of the old royal government, had been a&s;&s;umed, with the powers of government, by the people, had been thus acquired, by tho&s;e who were one party to the treaty, by force, and had been taken <HI>in battle</HI> after the declaration of the independency of the United States, from the armies of that &s;overeign body politic by the armies of the other &s;overeign body politic, in the cour&s;e of an exi&s;ting and known war; the &s;aid artillery being <HI>in&s;truments of war belonging to the adver&s;e power,</HI> and not <HI>private property</HI> appertenant, by its nature, to agriculture and menial hou&s;ehold &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In like manner, the &s;ame article and &s;entence of the treaty of peace obligate Great Britain to re&s;tore and deliver all archives, records, deeds, and papers, belonging to any of the &s;tates or to their citizens, unto the proper &s;tates and per&s;ons to whom <HI>"they belong;"</HI> and this is accompanied with a declaration, that it &s;hall be &s;o done, although the &s;aid objects, &s;o &s;tipulated to be delivered, may have been, and were, acquired during the cour&s;e of the war. Here we perceive, that the objects of the &s;tipula|tion are con&s;idered as <HI>belonging</HI> to tho&s;e from whom they were previou&s;ly acquired in the cour&s;e of the war. If the names and nature of the articles were different, it &s;till will appear, that no preci&s;e di&s;tinctions again&s;t the proper or owning rights or claims of the Americans were meant to be &s;et up. Had the arguments, or di&s;tinction now u&s;ed again&s;t the United States, been at all
<PB N="83" REF="028389_0370_0FD8EAD4205D6680">contemplated by Mr. O&s;wald, he would not, in the &s;ame &s;en|tence, have expre&s;sly &s;tated other objects, acquired by his na|tion in war, <HI>"to belong"</HI> to the American &s;tates and private per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onings, in the books upon the law of nations, in regard to booty, have been generally applied to clearly per&s;onal property of <HI>alien</HI> enemies, taken by the army of one country in its marches, battles, &s;ieges, and a&s;&s;aults, from the citizens of the other country. There is an ab&s;olute and undeniable <HI>pecu|liarity</HI> in the object in que&s;tion, and in the manner and circum|&s;tances by which the Briti&s;h troops acquired it, con&s;tituting a real difference between it and either the ordinary objects of <HI>"booty,"</HI> on the one hand, or <HI>the manner of making "booty"</HI> on the other, as <HI>contemplated</HI> and allowed by the military arti|cles in the law of nations. The difference in quality between <HI>this</HI> and <HI>every</HI> de&s;cription of per&s;onal property whatever, is manife&s;t and great. And although this fact places the American intere&s;t, in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, in a mo&s;t painful light, yet this di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance cannot impair the &s;tipulations of a treaty between two powers, both actually maintaining and ac|knowledging, at the time of the contract and ever &s;ince, the force of tho&s;e laws, which relate to the object.&mdash;Laws coun|tenanced by the one, as a parent, in the infancy of the other&mdash;laws, which, ere the manhood of the United States was ac|knowledged by the parent country, they had marked with a de|termined hand and a &s;incere heart, for gradual abolition and extinction.</P>
<P>Such and &s;o great is the difference between this &s;pecies of property and all others, that we mu&s;t apply to it, with propor|tionate circum&s;pection and candor, all the ordinary rules and rea&s;onings about the &s;ubject of <HI>"booty,"</HI> of war.</P>
<P>But if there &s;hould be found a great difference between this and the objects of military booty, creating rea&s;onable doubts, whether it can be completely &s;ubjected to the rules concerning booty, the difference, in regard to the manner of acquiring ordinary military booty and that of acquiring this object, is much more con&s;iderable and important. It was not by <HI>force of arms,</HI> nor by <HI>&s;tratagem,</HI> nor by <HI>&s;urprize,</HI> nor by <HI>the ordinary and allowed operations of enemies,</HI> but it was by &s;ending to <HI>places to which arms or military &s;tratagem or enterprize were not ex|tended,</HI> and there openly loo&s;ening the bands and laws of that civil &s;ociety, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Briti&s;h and American&mdash;by the party attracting it, and by the party de|prived of it. It is al&s;o to be remembered, that tho&s;e bands and
<PB N="84" REF="028389_0371_0FD8EAD68C3A0140">laws of &s;ociety then were, and &s;till are exi&s;ting unimpaired <HI>in the dominions of the party &s;o acquiring it.</HI></P>
<P>There are methods of obtaining the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|perty of an alien enemy, which would render the property &s;o acquired, not <HI>"booty of war."</HI> For example; a military officer of one nation remaining for a time within a town of an ho&s;tile nation, under the &s;anction of a pa&s;&s;port and flag, carries off the whole military che&s;t of the enemy of his nation: or, a detachment of the troops of one nation, obtain the military che&s;t of their enemy, from its e&s;corting party, &s;olely and con|fe&s;&s;edly by means prohibited by the laws of war. Will property acquired in the&s;e ways be con&s;idered, as "booty" of war? Or will it be con&s;idered as the acqui&s;ition of irregular individuals, by no means to be retained by the acquirers, but to be re&s;tored to the owner, particularly &s;o far as it &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the moment of reconciliation and peace? The acqui&s;ition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meri|can property, by offers of emancipation, is believe fir&s;t to have taken place under the governor of Virginia before the declaration of independence, who probably under a dangerou&s;ly incorrect idea of the power of maintaining martial law, went into the di&s;tinct and very different operation of an attempt to effectuate, by his proclamation, the annihilation of a legal property, of great aggregate value. When a practice has been commenced by one in very con&s;iderable &s;tation, it is too often followed by others, without due enquiry into its <HI>legality</HI> and propriety.</P>
<P>The governor of Virginia was not a per&s;on, on &s;everal &s;core<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who might be expected cautiou&s;ly to &s;ettle new and nice mat|ters, upon grounds perfectly and ab&s;olutely correct, in the out&s;et of a warm and di&s;tracting civil conte&s;t, which it then was. At <HI>the pre&s;ent time,</HI> no prerogative or power, founded in common or &s;tatute law, occurs to recollection, by which the chief executive magi&s;trate of Great Britain, or of a Bri|ti&s;h colony (without the re&s;t of the legi&s;lature) could aboli&s;h any right of property exi&s;ting within his juri&s;diction, and that without indictment, information or conviction of crime: much le&s;s could he de&s;troy the exi&s;ting legal relation between any two of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, who form, together with others, the body of members of the civil &s;ociety. Per&s;ons legally bound to others for a term of years, or for a longer time, could not &s;olely by his executive power, be relea&s;ed therefrom. It is a mea&s;ure which may be di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately affirmed to de&s;troy the bands of the &s;ociety&mdash;a mea&s;ure which the legi&s;lature only (if that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> effect&mdash;a mea&s;ure, as it &s;hould appear to rea&s;on, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ure in peace, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">owa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in war, and ab|&s;tained
<PB N="85" REF="028389_0372_0FD8EAD80D8E3AE8">from by mo&s;t of the Briti&s;h governors of that time, the pain of which, and part of the injuries of which, the &s;tipulation of the treaty of peace was well calculated to re|move. There are very few, indeed, it is believed, &s;ir, of the wi&s;e and good of either country, but what now &s;incerely wi&s;h, that the mea&s;ure of thus calling forth the unhappy blacks, had never been re&s;orted to.</P>
<P>A brief and &s;imple remark, &s;ir, aptly follows the preceding exa|mination of the &s;trict legal ground on which the object in que&s;tion &s;tood, as property or not property: That, as the Bri|ti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner fir&s;t u&s;ed words of promi&s;e, including <HI>all</HI> the negroes, and as he afterwards follows with the words "other <HI>property,</HI>" he mu&s;t have con&s;idered all the negroes as property, notwith&s;tanding the changes of &s;ituation, which they had un|dergone. It does not appear, by the notes of the American commi&s;&s;ioners, that he ever oppo&s;ed to their complaints or re|pre&s;entations about the negroes carried away, in the &s;everal preceding years, that they had been, or, indeed, that tho&s;e remaining were, legal booty of war, and not objects for com|pen&s;ation. The rea&s;on of a &s;tipulation, that is, the motive which led to the making of it, and the end then propo&s;ed, is con&s;idered, and ju&s;tly, as one of the mo&s;t certain means of e&s;tabli&s;hing the true &s;en&s;e; and great attention, &s;ays Vattel, ought to be paid to it, whenever it is required to explain an ob&s;cure, <HI>equivocal,</HI> and undetermined point, either of a law, or of a treaty, or to make application of them to a particular ca&s;e. We are not left, in this ca&s;e, to vague conjectures. The injuries which <HI>one party had &s;u&s;tained,</HI> by the <HI>attracting</HI> and carrying away <HI>of numbers of negroes</HI> by <HI>the other party,</HI> the bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit it had occa&s;ioned, and the de&s;ire to prevent &s;uch injuries, which could no longer wound an enemy, on account of the return of peace, and which would have gone far to bani&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary &s;pirit of reconciliation, rendered it a matter of found &s;en&s;e and rea&s;onable bu&s;ine&s;s, to exclude rigid ideas about compara|tively incon&s;iderable objects of property, u&s;ele&s;s to the Briti&s;h government, and to deliver up all the negroes, to which no private Briti&s;h claim was made. The difficulty of the faith pledged to the negroes, ab&s;ent and unrepre&s;ented, was very probably overlooked, amid&s;t the many and great objects which were to be adju&s;ted. And here it may be ob&s;erved, that, if Great Britain had promi&s;ed an impo&s;&s;ibility, which promi&s;e might have taken place, an equitable compen&s;ation, or the re|linqui&s;hment of the con&s;ideration promi&s;ed therefor by the United States, ought to have &s;ettled the matter. It will appear, from the papers of the time, to every per&s;on, who has faith in
<PB N="86" REF="028389_0373_0FD8EAD9DD2E2378">the truth of Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Jay, or Mr. Lau|rens, that this con&s;ideration was, the removal of the <HI>legal</HI> im|pediments to the recovery of the Briti&s;h debts. Leave us the&s;e de&s;criptions of our property, and take you tho&s;e, was the na|tural language: the <HI>quid pro quo.</HI> The American commi&s;&s;ioners agreed to every article to which their conceptions of their pow|ers extended. And here it is very material, indeed, to ob&s;erve, that, if the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s and the communications be|tween the American and Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners had not effectually and accurately fixed the de&s;ign of the &s;tipulation, it is wi&s;ely per|mitted by the law of nations, in order to promote the peace of mankind, to conjecture the meaning of the parties. Now no &s;ug|ge&s;tion or conjecture, as to the object on which the &s;tipulation could operate, is offered, except that the offended American commi&s;&s;ioners may have thereby meant to require Great Bri|tain to engage, that &s;he would not de&s;poil the unfortunate peo|ple within their lines, at the moment when &s;he was leaving them to undergo &s;erious difficulties, on account of their being found in that &s;ituation. This con&s;truction, perfectly odious as it regards Great Britain, the rules of interpretation of the law of nations, forbid. To the objection drawn from the odium, in which <HI>the nece&s;&s;ity to a&s;k of them &s;uch a &s;tipulation</HI> would have involved the Briti&s;h, is to be added the objection, &s;trong in|deed in my judgment, that the American commi&s;&s;ioners would not demand a &s;tipulation, exclu&s;ively in favor of tho&s;e with whom they were very highly offended, and omit to &s;ecure a great ma&s;s of property, much of it belonging to tho&s;e political friends with whom they had gone through the war, and who&s;e ca&s;e was particularly recommended to them by congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It will be ju&s;t remarked here, that the &s;tipulation does not &s;ay, <HI>the</HI> negroes and other property, but <HI>any</HI> negroes, or other pro|perty. In a general view, the words, <HI>the negroes</HI> and <HI>other pro|perty,</HI> would appear to be more nearly and accurately relative, than the words, <HI>any negroes</HI> or <HI>other property.</HI> The word "other," placed as it is, has rather the appearance of a ca&s;ual incor|rectne&s;s, than as intended to limit the &s;en&s;e of the broade&s;t po&s;&s;ible words, which precede it, viz. "any negroes," leaving us room to believe, that Mr. O&s;wald did not make doubts or difficulties concerning the ideas of property or owner&s;hip, notwith&s;tanding all the circum&s;tances which the negroes might have undergone. It mu&s;t be admitted, too, that the Briti&s;h idea of the interpretation does not free the word "other" from incorrectne&s;s. For <HI>"any,"</HI> taken alone, will include &s;laves, and free and indented negroes, and yet <HI>"other,"</HI> followed by "pro|perty," does, in their &s;en&s;e, include only one de&s;cription, being a
<PB N="87" REF="028389_0374_0FD8EADE2F929E90">very &s;mall proportion of the whole number of the negroes. This may appear like wire-drawing the &s;ubject; but &s;uch appear|ances are inevitable, in ca&s;es involving verbal critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Another, and great, difficulty would re&s;ult from not extending the &s;tipulation beyond the &s;laves of per&s;ons within the Briti&s;h lines. Peace being concluded, their negroes could not be re|moved, whether Briti&s;h or American property; &s;o that, as to them, the &s;tipulation was, in a &s;econd view, unnece&s;&s;ary. There would, therefore, be no object, on which the &s;tipulation could operate. The rules for interpreting the law of nations, it is be|lieved, do not permit any &s;ub&s;equent words to be &s;o con&s;trued, as to render a preceding &s;tipulation or entire provi&s;ion null and void.</P>
<P>It appears not improper to remark, that one party cannot rea&s;onably plead, that a thing is odious, which he has contri|buted to create in the country or conduct of the other party, and which is continued to be maintained by law in his own do|minions. To en&s;lave men is, indeed, in every view an offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s; but in the &s;en&s;e of an odious &s;tipulation under the law of nations, any power which maintains by law the purcha&s;e of men, never before &s;laves, and tran&s;ports them from their connections, cannot plead, that a &s;tipulation could not be intended in a certain &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e it might make them return men, &s;et free, back into &s;lavery. It is not here meant to in&s;inuate the &s;lighte&s;t reproach to Great Britain on this &s;ubject. It is confidently believed, that &s;he will &s;teadily pur&s;ue a &s;afe and &s;uitable plan of aboli&s;hing the &s;lave trade, and &s;lavery it&s;elf, throughout her dominions. In regard to the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the breach of faith, it has been already ob&s;erved, that it is probable the particular &s;ituations of all the negroes were not adverted to. No faithle&s;s intention towards them is believed to have exi&s;ted in the Briti&s;h government or commi&s;&s;i|oner. The United States did not long in&s;i&s;t upon a &s;pecific performance of the &s;tipulation. There is no rea&s;on, therefore, to doubt, that they would have cheerfully acquie&s;ced in an equita|ble compen&s;ation, in&s;tantly upon its being de&s;ired; and nothing but compen&s;ation is now po&s;&s;ible. When a &s;tipulation is made by an agent, employed as Mr. O&s;wald was, on a &s;udden, a very able merchant, but not a lawyer, nor ver&s;ed in diplo|matic bu&s;ine&s;s, di&s;tant from the &s;cene to which the negociation relates, and, con&s;equently, not impre&s;&s;ed with every minute circum&s;tance, that had occurred in the operations of the two powers, in a di&s;tant country, it is not unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e, that he might have contracted for an unob&s;erved point or two, which could not with propriety be complied with, on account
<PB N="88" REF="028389_0375_0FD8EAE1CAA34058">of engagements to which he did not advert, or even on account of the impo&s;&s;ibility of performance. If the matter &s;tipulated were ever &s;o unfavorable (and in that &s;en&s;e odious) or if it were impo&s;&s;ible, the right of the other party in a clear ca&s;e, to have the unfavorable or (as the law of nations terms it) the odious &s;tipulation executed, or the impo&s;&s;ible one compen&s;ated, would be in full force. The United States, waving the execu|tion of the odious inadvertent &s;tipulation from a becoming re|&s;pect to the feelings and honor of the other party, evidences an accommodating di&s;po&s;ition, to &s;ettle the matter by equitable compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Several important ob&s;ervations, on this point, of &s;ome length, yet remaining, I conclude for the pre&s;ent, with a&s;&s;urances of the &s;incere and perfect re&s;pect, with which</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by an able writer (under the &s;ignature of Camillus) who favors a ratification of the treaty, without any further amendments, that negroes, by the laws of the &s;tates, in which &s;lavery is allowed, are <HI>per&s;onal</HI> property. He, therefore, argues, that, like hor&s;es and cattle, and other move|ables, they were liable to become <HI>"booty."</HI> But, &s;ir, this opi|nion of Camillus, though on a point cardinally important to the argument, if again&s;t him, appears to be incorrect. In Virginia, <HI>negroes did not go to the executors of the decea&s;ed,</HI> but pa&s;&s;ed, by the laws, with lands and other real e&s;tate, <HI>by de&s;cent,</HI> to the heir at law. They were al&s;o &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws of <HI>dower</HI> as real e&s;tate. They were likewi&s;e capable of being <HI>entailed,</HI> ac|cording to the laws concerning real e&s;tate. This &s;ituation of the laws, was in that very quarter, wherein the Briti&s;h governor, alluded to above, commenced that executive infringement of them, which has formed the un&s;ound foundation of the opinion, that the blacks could be &s;o <HI>attracted or induced</HI> from home, as to become "booty of war." It is very important to this argument, that above half the &s;laves, in the late American provinces, be|longed to the people of Virginia, where the foregoing &s;tate of law prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="028389_0376_0FD8EAE3E38B0790">
It is not only clear, that a conciliating mind, like Mr. O&s;|wald's, mu&s;t have con&s;idered it as highly eligible for Great Bri|tain, &s;o to conduct the act of &s;eparation from this country, as to leave no cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction on account of &s;o irritating a matter as &s;poil; but it is certain, that in his tran&s;actions with the United States, <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t have con&s;idered them as part of the Briti&s;h empire, re&s;i&s;ting its general government, and not as an alien enemy. This mu&s;t have been his notion of the matter; for the parliament in 1782, held it nece&s;&s;ary formally to autho|rize the executive power, to acknowledge the future exi&s;tence of this country, as a di&s;tinct political &s;overeignty: and his mi&s;&s;ion was founded on that act of the parliament. Moreover, congre&s;s con&s;idered this unrelinqui&s;hed preten&s;ion, as &s;o im|portant and proper an idea for them to provide again&s;t, that about the &s;ame time they re&s;olved, that &s;uch an acknowledg|ment, ought to precede <HI>a negociation.</HI> From the&s;e facts on both &s;ides, it is clear, that the two parties, even while oppo&s;ed in arms, were not preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation of two alien ho&s;tile powers, different from, and unconnected with, each other, de <HI>jure,</HI> de <HI>lege,</HI> and de <HI>facto.</HI> Before the declaration of indepen|dence, the laws of war had but a certain extent of operation, on account of the municipal laws: and it is important to ob|&s;erve, that Great Britain, to the la&s;t hour of the war, &s;trictly adhered to this idea in her deportment towards the United States and to foreign nations, who aided them. Wherefore, as &s;he had &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages in the conte&s;t, from that principle, &s;he cannot regularly &s;et it a&s;ide, in order to apply the laws of <HI>"booty"</HI> of war, to this property of the other party, which was not acquired by military means. It has been ob&s;erv|ed, that &s;he did not deliver up &s;hips in con&s;equence of the treaty, and no doubt this very principle, con&s;tituted a part of her rea&s;ons; &s;he, con&s;idering the ve&s;&s;els of the United States as condemnable for breaches of the &s;tatutes pa&s;&s;ed by her parlia|ment, to &s;hut the American ports and prohibit intercour&s;e. Private &s;hips and cargoes were con&s;tantly condemned on the ground of tho&s;e municipal laws, or the laws of the empire, as &s;he held them, and not upon the laws of war and of nations.</P>
<P>Here it appears nece&s;&s;ary, to notice by the way, an inad|vertent, but material incorrectne&s;s in a writer on the treaty, wherein &s;hips are mentioned as the only &s;pecies of property, which does not become booty to an enemy, by the mere capture or acquiring of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It cannot be doubted, that all pro|perty whatever compo&s;ing the <HI>cargoes</HI> of &s;hips, all <HI>money</HI> and <HI>baggage</HI> of pa&s;&s;engers, all <HI>pa&s;&s;enger &s;laves,</HI> being the &s;ervants of pa&s;&s;engers or of the &s;hip's officers, and <HI>all &s;laves</HI> who are <HI>mari|ners</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="028389_0377_0FD8EAE4D59C2290">or <HI>a part of the crew</HI> of the &s;hip, mu&s;t be libelled and condemned, in a court of admiralty, and cannot be held by the laws of booty. There is one de&s;cription of property, which has never yet been &s;eized or retained by any civilized power, whe|ther taken by land or &s;ea; and that is, &s;ervants or apprentices, bound for terms of years. Yet Lord Dunmore's proclamation is believed to have extended to bound white per&s;ons. It would be particularly painful and inconvenient to Great Britain, and e&s;pe|cially on the breaking out of a war, if the time of &s;ervice of the numerous apprentices on board her private &s;hips, which terms of time are the fair and actual property of their ma&s;ters, &s;hould be libelled in the courts of admiralty, of a foreign country, and decreed to be the lawful property of the captors. This may place in a clearer light, <HI>the mighty evils</HI> which may be induced by de|&s;troying <HI>the legal relations,</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between per&s;ons in the &s;ame civil &s;ociety, by a military proclamation, re&s;orted to by the ex|ecutive power in a dome&s;tic quarrel, or by a foreign enemy in an ordinary war. To take apprentices and bound &s;ervants on land, and to make the right of their time of &s;ervice "booty" of war, would extend the evil, though it accords with the principle of the Briti&s;h proclamation. To tran&s;mit &s;uch procla|mations into countries remote from the reach of arms, offering freedom from their indentures, to all &s;uch &s;ervants and appren|tices, as &s;hould leave their ma&s;ters' hou&s;es, thereby di&s;&s;olving the bands of &s;ociety, and the exi&s;ting municipal laws of pro|perty, would lead, in a few years, to modes of warfare, which would immen&s;ely increa&s;e its dreadful calamities.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ted formerly in the kingdom of Great Britain it|&s;elf, a de&s;cription of &s;laves, well known to lawyers by the name of <HI>Villeins.</HI> The&s;e &s;laves were &s;ubject to the laws of real e&s;tates, and not to the rules of di&s;tribution concerning per&s;onal pro|perty. They were included among the hereditaments of that day. This is conceived to be an important circum&s;tance to di&s;|countenance the general &s;oundne&s;s of the idea, that a Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner could rea&s;onably deem &s;laves to be per&s;onal pro|perty.</P>
<P>The conduct of &s;overeigns holding &s;lave countries, may be con&s;idered as important on this &s;ubject. In the numerous and frequent wars between the European nations, having We&s;t India colonies, the mea&s;ure of emancipating the blacks had never been adopted, as a proper and ju&s;ti&s;iable mode of war|fare. It is not irrelative to this argument to remark, that Mr. O&s;wald was a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> We&s;t India merchant, and he may have remembered, that the blacks, in the conquered and re&s;tored i&s;lands, always followed the lands, and were al&s;o re&s;tored.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="028389_0378_0FD8BE999EBEE920">
Further: A circu&s;tance of great importance indeed to Great Britain and her &s;lave colonies, in relation to this very de&s;crip|tion of property, was pending during the time of the American negociation at Paris. A number of valuable We&s;t India i&s;lands had been taken by the French from the Briti&s;h in and between the years. 1778 and 1782. The&s;e were, St. Kitts, Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincents, Tobago, Dominica, Nevis and Mont|&s;erat. To the&s;e may be added, New Providence and the Baha|mas, taken by Spain. Many of the &s;laves on tho&s;e i&s;lands, by the arguments offered again&s;t the United States, were <HI>"booty."</HI> Their ca&s;e was that of <HI>capture</HI> before the capitulations or with|out a capitulation, in ordinary war between two di&s;tinct &s;ove|reigns, not commenced by an unlawful attempt to aboli&s;h a legal intere&s;t by an act of a &s;econdary executive magi&s;trate, and continued by military commanders and others, infringing the legi&s;lative juri&s;diction, if their juri&s;diction extended to &s;uch an act for the con&s;ideration moving thereto. It is po&s;&s;ible, that the apprehen&s;ion of &s;o embarra&s;&s;ing a difficulty, and &s;o deep an injury to the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands, which were to be re&s;tored, may have contributed to influence the Briti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioner to be &s;ilent about impediments to the American claim to <HI>"ary"</HI> of the negroes. Certain it is, that Great Britain de|rived exten&s;ive advantages from the circum&s;tance of the negroes on the re&s;tored i&s;lands, not being con&s;idered as booty; and equally certain it is, and highly meriting the candid con&s;idera|tion of Great Britain, as to the pa&s;t and <HI>future,</HI> that the deeply indebted planters of tho&s;e i&s;lands, could not have paid their debts to their Briti&s;h creditors, had con&s;iderable numbers of their negroes been kept from them upon the plea, that they were booty to the armies of France.</P>
<P>It is of very great importance to this American claim, and to the argument in favor of the United States, that the laws ex|i&s;ting in regard to the whole body of the negro &s;laves belong|ing to Great Britain, at the time of the preliminary treaty of peace, con&s;idered them in the light of real e&s;tate. They de|&s;cended with the lands to the heir, and were &s;ubject to the laws of dower, as lands. They were not put on the &s;ame footing as per&s;onal property. The laws of Jamaica, Antigua, and Barba|does, are here referred to. Tho&s;e i&s;lands were the greate&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable Briti&s;h We&s;t India colonies, having, by accre|dited accounts, in 1782, near 300, 000 &s;laves. It is to be ob|&s;erved, that of all the We&s;t India i&s;lands, tho&s;e three alone, remained to Great Britain on the 20th November, 1782; all the re&s;t and the Florida &s;lave colonies, were taken by the French and Spaniards. The captured i&s;lands were returned in the ordi|nary
<PB N="92" REF="028389_0379_0FD8EAED0A7FFD00">general terms; and in numerous in&s;tances, the que&s;tion of &s;laves being booty, and the right of carrying the &s;laves away, might have been rai&s;ed by the French and Spaniards, upon the principles now urged by Great Britain, again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e of &s;ome con&s;equence on this &s;ubject, that the French colonial laws, which were founded on <HI>the cu&s;toms of the city of Paris,</HI> contemplated this new de&s;cription of property, in certain re&s;pects, with &s;ome of the ideas attached to immove|able property. The plantations and negroes <HI>thereon,</HI> of per&s;ons dying inte&s;tate, ve&s;ted in the heirs, and could not be &s;old during their minority. But the goods and chattels (as we call them) could be &s;old. It is al&s;o under&s;tood, that they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the laws concerning dower, &s;ettlements, and the return of e&s;tates of per&s;ons, dying without i&s;&s;ue, to the &s;ource, from which they came to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some ideas concerning the right of <HI>po&s;lliminium</HI> appear to have an important relation to this ca&s;e. Upon the foundation of that right, the Roman law (the parent &s;tock of the civil law and law of nations) treated &s;laves, taken in war, in a manner op|po&s;ite to that in which things, now called per&s;onal property, were treated. They were not &s;ubject to the rules of booty, which worked a change of property by the mere acquiring of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to tho&s;e things at pre|&s;ent termed goods and chattels; but &s;laves were returned, like real e&s;tates, contrary to tho&s;e rules, to their former own|ers, on a pacification. This idea in the ancient law of nations (with the laws of villeinage) has no doubt had &s;ome influence in fixing the practice of leaving the proprietors of the captured We&s;t India i&s;lands in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;laves, in all ca&s;es wherein their lands were not confi&s;cated. Although the i&s;lands of. Grenada and the Grenadines were conquered, without a capitulation, by France, in 1778, no pretence was &s;et up by the French on returning tho&s;e i&s;lands at the peace of 1783, according to the treaty, that the &s;laves were retainable and might be carried away by them as <HI>"booty"</HI> of war, becau&s;e not included in the words, which returned the territory. The po&s;i|tion, that the property in a captured &s;lave remains to an owner, &s;o as to give a &s;ufficient foundation to claim him in ca&s;e he &s;hall be in the fir&s;t owner's country at the clo&s;e of the war, re|ceives the greate&s;t countenance from the ancient law of nations, and from the recent proceedings thereunder between Great Britain and her ordinary enemies. Wherefore, it &s;eems that the proclamation of Lord Dunmore is as de&s;titute of &s;upport from
<PB N="93" REF="028389_0380_0FD8EAEE8A3BFEC0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he law of nations, and the practice thereon, as from the mu|nicipal &s;tatutes of his former government.</P>
<P>There &s;till exi&s;t, unhappily, <HI>throughout the world,</HI> too many in&s;tances of perpetual and hereditary &s;lavery. <HI>No quarter of the globe is entirely free from it.</HI> Whatever may be the virtuous di&s;|po&s;itions of many individuals and of &s;everal nations, it is evi|dent, that this painful practice cannot be ended in a day; nor would too &s;udden an abolition promote the comfort of tho&s;e unhappy men. While it is permitted to continue, it will add infinitely to the mi&s;ery of &s;laves, if they are to be con&s;idered hereafter, like the cattle on a farm, as capable of becoming <HI>booty</HI> in war; and it mu&s;t &s;ubject to di&s;traction and utter ruin, all tho&s;e vulnerable and defencele&s;s i&s;lands and colonies, in which the&s;e unhappy people form a large majority of the popu|lation.</P>
<P>On a calm review of the grounds of this American claim upon Great Britain, it will appear, that the acqui&s;ition of the blacks by the Briti&s;h forces was commenced and largely exe|cuted by an unprecedented act of a civil governor, <HI>contrary to the laws of the land</HI> by which he was bound; that it was conti|nued by unprecedented acts of the Briti&s;h military commanders, contrary to <HI>the law and u&s;age of notions,</HI> by which they were bound&mdash;that any de&s;cription of property thus <HI>irregularly</HI> ac|quired again&s;t the municipal law and the law of nations, could neither have been rendered the property of the acquirers, nor capable of being di&s;po&s;ed of by them, nor capable of being retained by them; but that it ought to have been re&s;tored by them, even if it were, &s;trictly &s;peaking, per&s;onal property; and that con&s;equently, had it been indi&s;putably of that de&s;crip|tion, it could not have been carried away, becau&s;e of the manner in which it was obtained. It will al&s;o appear, that a majority of the de&s;cription of property in que&s;tion was held, in the United States, as real and inheritable e&s;tate, con&s;equently not &s;ubject to the laws of booty; that this was particularly the ca&s;e throughout the whole of the late juri&s;diction of the earl of Dunmore; that the ancient law of England made the <HI>villein</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h &s;lave</HI> likewi&s;e inheritable e&s;tate, and pa&s;&s;ed him like the lands; that the laws of all the remaining. Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands in 1782, contemplated the negroes as real e&s;tate; that the French colonial laws con&s;idered them, in &s;everal very im|portant particulars, like immoveable property; that the ancient Romans held them to be, like lands, within the laws of po&s;tlimi|nium, in oppo&s;ition to the rules concerning "booty" in war; that the <HI>pre&s;criptive law of nations,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the practice of Great Britain, France, Spain, &amp;c. re&s;tored them after war, as
<PB N="94" REF="028389_0381_0FD8EAF34349C430">and with real e&s;tates, not only in capitulating i&s;lands, conquered from each other, but even, as in the ca&s;e of Grenada and the Grenadines, <HI>in i&s;lands conquered unconditionally, or without capi|tulation;</HI> that therefore, <HI>by tho&s;e general pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed rules,</HI> both written and pre&s;criptive, which bound the French not to carry away the negroes from the re&s;tored Briti&s;h i&s;lands, e&s;pecially from Grenada and the Grenadines, the Briti&s;h were bound not to carry away from the United States any negroes, which were acquired from the Americans, even if nothing had been &s;aid of negroes of other property in the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>It is moreover hoped, &s;ir, that it has been made to appear to have been the real intention and meaning of both parties to the treaty of peace, that no negroes &s;hould be carried away. This is evidenced, it is conceived, by the repre&s;entations, before and at the moment, of the American commi&s;&s;ioners, and by the omi&s;&s;ion of counter repre&s;entations, and the con&s;equently implied acquie&s;cence of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner; likewi&s;e by the words of the treaty it&s;elf in regard to the negroes, fairly con&s;trued and interpreted by the rules drawn from rea&s;on and the law of nations, and &s;upported by &s;imilar provi&s;ions, concern|ing the American artillery, archives, papers, &amp;c. and la&s;tly, this idea of the meaning of the parties appears to be rendered nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable by the impo&s;&s;ibility of finding any other meaning, which either party could think it u&s;eful or proper to make the &s;ubject matter of a &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>How far this mea&s;ure of the Briti&s;h commanders, if really contrary to the law of nations and to the treaty of peace, is the fir&s;t fact of the nature of an infraction on either &s;ide, and how far it ought to be compen&s;ated, if it was an infraction of the law of nations or of the treaty, though it &s;hould prove not to have been the fir&s;t breach of the treaty, remains to be con&s;i|dered.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">No. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE 7th rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e the commerce we have hi|therto enjoyed in India, in common with other nations, is &s;o re&s;tricted, that in future it will be of little or no &s;ub&s;tan|tial benefit to our citizens."</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it ought to be remarked, that, according to the rights claimed by all nations, having colonies, to which all other nations have acceded, we have no po&s;itive right to go to any of the colonies of the Briti&s;h crown; and that, unle&s;s &s;uch right is obtained by treaty, the Briti&s;h may inhibit our trading, or even entering the ports of their colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, with|out affording any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. The right of con|fining the trade of colonies to the parent country, and exclud|ing all &s;trangers from any participation therein, is as old and as univer&s;al, as any claimed by the pre&s;ent commercial nations of Europe.</P>
<P>By our treaty with France, his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty agrees to continue to the &s;ubjects of the United States, the free ports which have been and are open in the French i&s;lands of Ame|rica: in all of which free ports the &s;aid &s;ubjects &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame agreeably to the regulations which relate to them.</P>
<P>An arret of the king of France, on the 30th of Augu&s;t, 1784, declares the free ports in the i&s;lands of America, and the re|gulations they &s;hall be &s;ubject to&mdash;the &s;ize of ve&s;&s;els&mdash;the ar|ticles they may carry in, and bring away. The ve&s;&s;els are to be &s;ixty tons at the lea&s;t, and the merchandizes, wood, &s;alt, beef, fi&s;h, rice, maize, vegetables, &s;kins, furs, ro&s;in, pitch and tar. Salt beef and fi&s;h are &s;ubjected to a duty of three livres per quintal, be&s;ide the general duties on the cargo: which three livres are converted into a bounty on the French fi&s;hery. The articles, permitted to be taken away in return, were limited to ta&s;&s;ia and mela&s;&s;es&mdash;and goods imported there from France. Commi&s;&s;ioners were to be appointed to re&s;ide in the&s;e free ports, to &s;ee that the regulations were &s;trictly complied with; and the more &s;ecurely to guard the trade, the merchants and captains of ve&s;&s;els, re&s;iding in tho&s;e ports, were authorized to choo&s;e from among them&s;elves, commi&s;&s;ioners who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in watching the foreign ve&s;&s;els and denouncing negligencies. By our treaty with the United Netherlands, it is is expre&s;sly
<PB N="96" REF="028389_0383_0FD8EAF932CE7070">agreed, "that the United States, their &s;ubjects and inhabitants, &s;hall leave to tho&s;e of their high mightine&s;&s;es, the peaceable enjoyment of their rights in the countries, i&s;lands, and &s;eas, in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, without any hindrance or mole&s;tati|on." It appears, then, that the right of excluding foreigners from a direct trade to their colonies, and confining the trade of the coloni&s;ts to the mother country, is not only practi&s;ed among all the European nations, but has been expre&s;sly recog|nized by the United States of America. Hence it clearly fol|lows, that every relaxation of the colonial &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a favor to that nation, in who&s;e behalf it is &s;o relaxed. This u&s;ed to be our rea&s;oning on the arret of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he king of France, admitting us, in common with other foreigners, into the We&s;t Indies, however limited in the tonnage of the ve&s;&s;els, and in the cargoes permitted to be imported and exported.</P>
<P>This is con&s;idered to be the permanent &s;tate of things. In times of great &s;carcity in the i&s;lands, they have been free for the importation of certain other articles. In times of war, the French have generally opened their colonies to all foreigners, becau&s;e it is more important to have their &s;eamen on board their &s;hips of war, than be the &s;ole &s;uppliers and carriers for their colonies. During the la&s;t war, in the year 1779, the French opened the trade of their We&s;t India i&s;lands to neutral nations: the con&s;equences were alarming to the merchants of France; and repre&s;entations were made again&s;t the mea&s;ure from Bourdeaux, Nantz, and other large towns; and immedi|ately on &s;igning the preliminary articles of peace, this permi&s;|&s;ion to neutral nations was withdrawn.</P>
<P>The &s;ame was done at the Havannah. While Loui&s;burg and Canada were colonies of France, they were not allowed a direct trade to the We&s;t Indies. And &s;uch has been the jea|lou&s;y of European nations re&s;pecting their colonies, that Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once pa&s;&s;ed a decree, ordering the governors of their We&s;t In|dia colonies to &s;eize and confi&s;cate &s;hips and cargoes coming within a league of the &s;hores of their i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The right we enjoy, without treaty, of going into the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, is merely permi&s;&s;ive in that nation. The trade has been but of few years.&mdash;Lord Sheffield, in his argument again&s;t admitting the Americans into the We&s;t India i&s;lands, remarks, "That the Americans have no more preten&s;ions to go to our We&s;t India i&s;lands, than to our Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements; yet the latter would be thought a very extraordinary &s;tep."</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of this writer have been much adopted by the Briti&s;h government, relative to their We&s;t Indies, &s;ince the revolution, and may, therefore, give us &s;ome idea what that na|tion
<PB N="97" REF="028389_0384_0FD8EAFD34C189F8">thinks of our right to a commerce with their Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements. If Great Britain &s;hould refu&s;e to admit our ve&s;&s;els into her Ea&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it would be no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint on the part of the United States. France and Spain, as has been &s;hown, opened the trade of &s;ome of their colonies, during the la&s;t war, to all neutral nations; and immediately on return of peace, that trade was again confined to the pa|rent countries. Neither the United States, nor any other nati|on, who had enjoyed the benefits of this free trade, pretended to claim a continuance, becau&s;e it had been permitted to them, or to deny the authority of the&s;e two nations to prohibit them entering their colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, much le&s;s to make complaint at being denied a privilege, before indulged to them.</P>
<P>Having, then, no rights of commerce in the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t In|dies, which that nation may not take from us, without ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint on our part, let us con&s;ider what are the re&s;trictions impo&s;ed on the trade by treaty, and whether it will not continue to be a &s;ub&s;tantial benefit to our citizens, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>By the 13th article, there is an expre&s;s &s;tipulation on the part of the Briti&s;h king, that we &s;hall freely carry on a trade with the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, paying a tonnage duty on our ve&s;&s;els, no higher than Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els pay in American ports, and no higher duties on the importation and exportation of their car|goes, than &s;hall be payable on the &s;ame articles, when import|ed or exported in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els; the articles exported to be carried to the United States, and there unladen; and both par|ties, whenever it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hall adopt &s;uch regulations as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to the due ob&s;ervance of this &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions ari&s;e on this part of the article&mdash;fir&s;t, &s;up|po&s;ing the trade to be ab&s;olutely confined to the carrying of merchandi&s;e of any &s;ort, not ab&s;olutely prohibited, to the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, and the importing from tho&s;e &s;ettlements, directly into the United States, all articles not ab&s;olutely pro|hibited.</P>
<P>Is a trade, thus limited, &s;ub&s;tantially beneficial? We mu&s;t either procure the produce of that country, directly from the Ea&s;t Indies, making payment there, in &s;uch articles as &s;hall be convenient for us to carry, and &s;uited to their market, or we mu&s;t buy them in Europe, and pay for them there.</P>
<P>Taking for granted, then, that there is no profit on the car|go carried to the Ea&s;t Indies (though &s;ometimes very great profits are made on the outward cargo) let it be con&s;idered, that, in the fir&s;t place, we procure all our Ea&s;t India goods at
<PB N="98" REF="028389_0385_0FD8EB009CC1FFE0">the fir&s;t co&s;t, from the hands of the producer. In the latter, they are purcha&s;ed with all the additional charges of freight to Europe, commi&s;&s;ions, and profits of every man concerned in procuring them in India, &s;ending them to Europe, and &s;elling them there; and when it is remembered, that the trade from Europe is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in companies, which pay an im|men&s;e &s;um for this monopoly, and is at va&s;t expen&s;e for the &s;upport of military and civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, to &s;ecure their trade and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the orderly management of their concerns; all which mu&s;t be charged on the goods, before they are &s;old in Europe; it cannot be doubted, that the direct trade to and from the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, will continue to be &s;ub&s;tantially beneficial. Indeed, it is a well authenticated fact, that Ea&s;t India goods are twenty-five per cent. cheaper in the United States than in Europe; and, if imported from Europe by us, the charge mu&s;t be made of at lea&s;t ten per cent. more, which would ari&s;e for commi&s;&s;ions and exchange. It is clear, then, that we &s;hould procure our Ea&s;t India goods from thirty to forty per centum cheaper, under this article, than without the permi&s;&s;ion to go to the Ea&s;t Indies, which it &s;ecures to us; the difference may be fairly called a &s;ub&s;tantial benefit to our citizens. This is the ca&s;e in times of peace; in time of war the difference will be greater, the charges in Europe being greatly accumulated by war-freight and in&s;urance.</P>
<P>The other que&s;tion that ari&s;es on this article, is, are we, that is to &s;ay, both nations, con&s;trained to keep this trade thus limited? Has not Britain the power to grant, and the United States the capacity to exerci&s;e, the right of carrying Ea&s;t In|dia goods to Europe, if both parties con&s;ent? When two make a contract, in which no other is intere&s;ted; may they not di&s;&s;olve it, if both plea&s;e? If di&s;&s;olve it, may they not grant to each other larger and greater benefits than are &s;tipula|ted in the contract? Does &s;tipulating to grant a right, by an individual or a nation, preclude a power to extend that right, or grant or permit the exerci&s;e of others? Is there any moral or natural incapacity in the United States, to receive an exten|&s;ion of the commerce, granted in that article? Is there any in Great Britain to grant? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be clear, and will readily &s;how, that the having certain rights, by expre&s;s &s;tipula|tion, cannot interfere with the grant or permi&s;&s;ion of others.</P>
<P>Has any other power a right, then, to prohibit Britain from permitting, and America from exerci&s;ing, other rights? It is not pretended there is any.</P>
<P>If the treaty is ratified, and Great Britain &s;hall choo&s;e to demand of us to make &s;uch regulations as will in&s;ure to them,
<PB N="99" REF="028389_0386_0FD8EB0234C33F78">that the ve&s;&s;els of the United States &s;hall carry the goods laden in the Ea&s;t Indies, to the United States, and there unlade them, we &s;hall be bound to do it. But as this is a &s;tipulation on our part, and for her benefit, if &s;he choo&s;es to wave it, and clear out our ve&s;&s;els from her ports for Europe, they will have a right to go there. The cu&s;tom hou&s;e clearance would be an expre&s;s con&s;ent on her part, and our right could not be conte&s;ted by any one.</P>
<P>A mi&s;take of the treaty, has induced &s;ome people to &s;uppo&s;e there are more re&s;trictions on this trade, than is fairly warrant|ed by the article.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that the coa&s;ting trade of India, now enjoyed, is henceforth ab&s;olutely interdicted. The words are, "it is al&s;o under&s;tood, that the permi&s;&s;ion granted by this arti|cle, is not to extend to allow the ve&s;&s;els of the United States to carry on any part of the coa&s;ting trade of the Briti&s;h territo|ries." The legal, natural import of the&s;e words is, by virtue of this article, no right &s;hall be claimed to the coa&s;ting trade of the Briti&s;h territories in India. The words are intended to pre|vent a right by implication; which the generality of the terms, expre&s;&s;ing our authority to trade there, might be con&s;trued to include. It certainly takes away no right drawn from other clau&s;es. If a right to the coa&s;ting trade of India, can be founded on other principles, or derived from other &s;ources; this article certainly does not infringe that right: for the words are, "that the permi&s;&s;ion granted by this article, is not to extend," &amp;c. We are &s;urely then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the rights we were enti|tled to without the treaty.</P>
<P>Great Britain, unle&s;s the treaty is ratified, may re&s;trict us from the coa&s;ting trade of her territories in India, and al&s;o from all trade there, even that of direct importation and expor|tation. If the treaty is ratified, &s;he will po&s;&s;e&s;s, notwith&s;tand|ing that, the right &s;he had before, and no greater, to prohibit us from that coa&s;ting trade; but &s;he will not po&s;&s;e&s;s a right to refu&s;e us the direct trade of importation and exportation from her Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements. Before the treaty is ratified, &s;he may permit to our ve&s;&s;els the coa&s;ting trade&mdash;after it is ratified, &s;he may permit the &s;ame.</P>
<P>By our treaty with the United Netherlands, we recognized, in expre&s;s terms, their colonial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ights in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t In|dies. Nobody ever doubted they were free to permit, and we to exerci&s;e, the right of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ading to their colonies: and accordingly they have permi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to us, and we have enjoyed, a very lucra|tive, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> re&s;tricted trade to &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially to S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and Demarara.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="028389_0387_0FD8EBF446EC85A0">
The 8th rea&s;on offered by the town again&s;t ratifying the treaty, is, "Becau&s;e in every &s;tipulation re&s;pecting our inter|cour&s;e with the colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Great Britain, the whole commerce of the United States, in &s;uch intercour&s;e, is colo|nized in return."</P>
<P>The writer of the&s;e remarks is at a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to comprehend the preci&s;e meaning of the town in this rea&s;on. Does it mean that if we are permitted to trade with the colonies of Great Britain, we can trade with tho&s;e colonies only, or that we cannot ex|port the articles we obtain there, from the United States to any other country?</P>
<P>Some nations have &s;urrendered the whole commerce of their colonies to an exclu&s;ive company; others, without e&s;tabli&s;hing an exclu&s;ive company, have confined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular part of the mother country&mdash;whence no &s;hip was allowed to &s;ail, but either m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fleet, and at a particular &s;ea&s;on; or, if &s;ingle, in con&s;equence of a licen&s;e. Other nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their &s;ubjects, who may carry it on from all the different parts of the mother country, and who have occa&s;ion for no other licen&s;e than the common di&s;patches of the cu&s;tom hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This is an account of the conduct of parent countries to their colonies, by the celebrated Adam Smith, in his treati&s;e on the wealth of nations. Ander&s;on, in his origin of commerce, &s;peaking on the &s;ame &s;ubject &s;ays, "By every principle of ju&s;tice, of the law of nations, and the cu&s;toms of the other powers of Europe, who had &s;ettlements and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ant dependen|cies, the mother country had an exclu&s;ive right to trade with, and to forbid all others from having any intercour&s;e with them. Such an exclu&s;ive right cannot be denied to be the very e&s;&s;ence of colonization."</P>
<P>The above quotations are made for the purpo&s;e of obtaining a clear idea of the rights of nations having colonies, and the obligations and re&s;trictions of &s;uch colonies; that by examining the &s;tate of our commerce under the treaty, we may conclude, whether, conformable to any ju&s;t idea affixed to the terms, "co|lonizing commerce." it can be truly &s;aid, "that the whole commerce of the United States in &s;uch intercour&s;e is colonized in return." By colonizing commerce mu&s;t then probably be under&s;tood, re&s;tricting commerce to a particular country, and particular people.</P>
<P>The 3d and 13th articles of the treaty appear to be the only ones that re&s;pect our trade to the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the 3d, we may trade freely by land in their colonies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> carry there all &s;orts of goods, and bring back any thing in return
<PB N="101" REF="028389_0388_0FD8EB07689E8B58">We are &s;till free to procure the like articles, from any other part of the world&mdash;and what we bring from tho&s;e colonies, we may export wherever we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is no re&s;triction as to the articles to be imported into their colonies, or exported from them by us, nor as to the place to which we may export the articles, &s;o brought from them.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts may come into the United States, in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, as we enter their territories: but there is no re&s;triction that we will &s;ell only to them; or which gives to them any exclu&s;ive privilege, that the &s;ame rights granted to them by treaty, we are not free to grant to all the world.</P>
<P>The 13th article gives us a right to trade to the Ea&s;t Indies; but contains no contract, that we will not buy el&s;ewhere, the like articles, that we procure from their &s;ettlements&mdash;neither does it &s;ay, that they &s;hall have the exclu&s;ive privilege of trad|ing with us&mdash;and the merchandizes brought into the United States, from tho&s;e &s;ettlements, are as free to be exported to any part of the world, as though that article did not exi&s;t&mdash;There does not appear any thing like that &s;ort of re&s;triction on us, or exclu&s;ive right to them, that can ju&s;tify the terms, "colonizing the whole commerce of the United States, in &s;uch intercour&s;e, in return."</P>
<P>The 9th rea&s;on given by the town, is, "Becau&s;e the clau&s;e by which the Briti&s;h government re&s;erves to it&s;elf the right of impo&s;ing on American ve&s;&s;els, entering Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a duty which &s;hall countervail the difference of the duty paya|ble on the importation of European and A&s;iatic goods, into the United States, in Briti&s;h or American bottoms, places it in the power of that government, to enable Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to become the importers of A&s;iatic and European goods, into the United States, to the exclu&s;ion of our own citizens."</P>
<P>It is really difficult to comprehend how the re&s;ervation here mentioned, can be attended with the con&s;equences &s;ugge&s;ted by the town.</P>
<P>If our ve&s;&s;els enter their ports on equal terms as we permit their ve&s;&s;els to enter ours, it is hard to conceive, that we &s;hould be the lo&s;ers&mdash;we make a rule, which the treaty &s;uppo&s;es more again&s;t them than the rule by which they a&s;&s;e&s;s our ve&s;&s;els. It is not probable that a nation of equal power, would con&s;ent to terms manife&s;tly unequal; neither is it reconcileable with the common principles of equity and ju&s;tice, for a nation to object to that part of the bargain, which re&s;erves equal rights. At any rate, it may be fairly &s;tated, that it is no objection to the treaty;
<PB N="102" REF="028389_0389_0FD8EB090FFDB060">for it gives Great Britain no new powers on this &s;ubject. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a right of countervailing the difference mentioned, without any aid of the treaty&mdash;and may exerci&s;e it whenever &s;he plea&s;es. By the treaty &s;he obligates her&s;elf to impo&s;e no higher duties on our ve&s;&s;els, than &s;he does on tho&s;e of all other nations.</P>
<P>The 10th rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e, although the terms of &s;aid treaty appear to be reciprocal in many in&s;tances; yet, from the local &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the United States, and the pacific &s;y&s;tem of policy they have adopted, that reciprocity is merely nominal and delu&s;ive."</P>
<P>The town leaves the world to conjecture what are the con&s;e|quences flowing from the local &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the United States, and the pacific &s;y&s;tem they have adopted, that render the reciprocity purported by the terms of &s;aid treaty, to be merely nominal and delu&s;ive. Perhaps the pre&s;ident may &s;ee them from the a&s;&s;ertion of the town; but &s;urely it was due from the town to the people of the United States, to point out the delu&s;ion which had been overlooked by the mini&s;ter and go|vernment of the United States. Not being able to detect this delu&s;ion without further light, the writer mu&s;t pa&s;s over this rea&s;on, with a reque&s;t to his readers, that they would not a&s;&s;ent to this a&s;&s;ertion, without examining the treaty for them&s;elves, and at lea&s;t, de&s;iring the committee or &s;electmen of Bo&s;ton, to expo&s;e the fraud before they pa&s;s cen&s;ure on their whole go|vernment, for being deluded blockheads, or &s;omething wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the 11th rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e it prevents the United States from impo&s;ing any further re&s;trictions on the Briti&s;h trade alone."</P>
<P>If it were not the town of Bo&s;ton, &s;o re&s;pectable for wi&s;|dom and good &s;en&s;e, that offered this rea&s;on, one would hardly &s;u&s;pect that the rea&s;on originated in any thing, but a di&s;po&s;ition to prevent all pacific arrangements with that nation. For no one will believe, that Britain, or any other nation, who is not an humble, vanqui&s;hed &s;uppliant&mdash;would ever con&s;ent to make a treaty, by which &s;he &s;hould place us on the &s;ame terms as the mo&s;t favored nations; and we re&s;erve to our&s;elves the right to treat her, on terms le&s;s favorable than we do others. In our treaty with France, the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Pru&s;|&s;ia, we have reciprocally agreed to place each other on &s;uch terms. It is not wonderful that Mr. Jay could not induce the Briti&s;h nation, to bind them&s;elves to treat us, as well as they do others, and leave us at liberty to treat them wor&s;e than we do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ers, when they give up privileges in Europe, equal to what we received from other powers, with whom we had treaties, and &s;ome very important ones, not received from them; &s;uch as

<HEAD><HI>Remarks on Mr. Charles Pinckney's Speech,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. page 5.</NOTE> Delivered at St. Michael's Church <HI>(Charle&s;ton)</HI> the 22d July la&s;t, on the Subject of the Treaty: publi&s;hed in the City and State Ga|zettes of the 4th Augu&s;t, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, by a writer much admired, that "howe|ver u&s;eful jealou&s;y may be in republics, yet when, like bile in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic; the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the delu&s;ive appearances which the malady ca&s;ts on &s;urrounding objects." From this cau&s;e, probably, have proceeded many of the fears and apprehen&s;ions excited by the treaty.</P>
<P>The &s;peech in que&s;tion begins with a violent attack on the pre&s;ident, for having committed two breaches of the con&s;titu|tion, the one in having appointed the chief ju&s;tice of the United States, envoy extraordinary to Great Britain; the other in hav|ing given him in&s;tructions, re&s;pecting a treaty, without con|&s;ulting the &s;enate.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, No part of the con&s;titution is quoted to &s;how that the appointment of Mr. Jay infringed it: but an inference is drawn from a &s;uppo&s;ed incon&s;i&s;tency in &s;ending a man to negociate a treaty, re&s;pecting which he might be called on to give a judicial opinion. This objection might as well have applied to his origi|nal appointment as chief ju&s;tice, having previou&s;ly negociated a treaty, re&s;pecting which he might be called upon to give an opinion from the bench. The objection would be as good again&s;t appointing any man a judge who had ever negociated a treaty, as again&s;t appointing any man a negociator who had been a judge. Perhaps the objection would be as &s;trong again&s;t placing
<PB N="104" REF="028389_0391_0FD8EB0C3ADC7758">on the bench any man who had publicly expre&s;&s;ed an opinion on a treaty, which he might be required to con&s;ider as judge, or a member of the legi&s;lature who had been concerned in making a law, which he might afterwards, as judge, be called upon to expound, or, in &s;hort, a hundred other &s;uch ca&s;es. Had there been a <HI>con&s;titutional incompatibility,</HI> in that ca&s;e, the in&s;tant Mr. Jay accepted his commi&s;&s;ion as envoy, he would have cea&s;ed to be chief ju&s;tice; becau&s;e, where the con&s;titution creates an incompatibility, it vacates in&s;tantly one office, by the acceptance of the other. Either, therefore, there was an incom|patibility, or there was not. If there was, then the in&s;tant Mr. Jay accepted his commi&s;&s;ion as envoy, he cea&s;ed to be chief ju&s;tice; and all the noi&s;e about <HI>&s;ending the chief ju&s;tice,</HI> was idle and ridiculous; if there was no incompatibility, then all the noi&s;e about violating the con&s;titution, was equally idle and ridi|culous. Was there a greater violation of the con&s;titution in taking one of the judicial department to be an envoy, than one of the legi&s;lature? yet Mr. <HI>Monroe, being &s;enator,</HI> was appointed mini&s;ter to France. The con&s;titution is &s;ilent about both; the incon&s;i&s;tency applied equally to both: But there was not a whi&s;|per of di&s;approbation at the appointment of the latter. Per&s;onal, and not public motives, account for this difference. Mr. Mon|roe, indeed, re&s;igned his office of &s;enator, <HI>after his appointment:</HI> Mr. Jay might have done the &s;ame. <HI>At the time</HI> of the appoint|ment, the &s;ame objection applied to both; it depended on the di&s;cretion of both, to re&s;ign or not. La&s;t year, the governor of Penn&s;ylvania &s;ent the chief ju&s;tice of that &s;tate as a &s;pecial en|voy or commi&s;&s;ioner, to negociate terms of peace with the in&s;urgents, and to make a treaty or convention, re&s;pecting which he might be called upon, as chief ju&s;tice, to give an opi|nion from the bench. The pre&s;ident, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent one of the judges of the &s;upreme court of Penn&s;ylvania, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame mi&s;&s;ion: not a &s;yllable of di&s;approbation was uttered again&s;t either appointment. The probable evils which have been threatened by the chief ju&s;tice of the United States remaining on the bench, after negociating the treaty, are done away; for he has actually re&s;igned.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The pre&s;ident is charged with having violated the con&s;ti|tution by withholding from the &s;enate a knowledge of the in|&s;tructions he gave to Mr. Jay. The &s;peech tells us, "that it was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> by <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the members, that the pre&s;ident ought to have &s;ubmitted to them the <HI>whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> upon which Mr. Jay was to have been &s;ent; but a motion to that effect was brought forward and <HI>negatived:</HI>" The &s;enate, who are certainly competent judges of their own rights, and not likely to &s;ur|render
<PB N="105" REF="028389_0392_0FD8EB1084CF0C70">them, then conceived they had no right to call on the pre&s;ident for the in&s;tructions. The &s;peech tells us, "that <HI>many</HI> of the members of the &s;enate were of opinion, at that time, that Mr. Jay was &s;ent for the purpo&s;e of obtaining compen&s;ation for the depredations in the We&s;t Indies, to demand the delivery of the po&s;ts, and the execution of the treaty of peace; and to require a &s;tipulation that our ve&s;&s;els &s;hould not in future be lia|ble to &s;eizure or condemnation on any pretence;" and the con|clu&s;ion drawn, is, that tho&s;e and others, alone, were the &s;ubjects on which Mr. Jay was &s;uppo&s;ed by the &s;enate to be &s;ent to ne|gociate; and yet in another place it tells us, that a motion was made in the &s;enate, to require the pre&s;ident to &s;ubmit the <HI>whole</HI> of the bu&s;ine&s;s upon which Mr. Jay was &s;ent; con&s;equently, the &s;enate mu&s;t have believed that <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e</HI> were <HI>not</HI> the <HI>only objects,</HI> about which he was &s;ent. The &s;peech then lays down this doctrine, in po&s;itive terms, "that the con&s;titution gives no power to the pre&s;ident to <HI>commence</HI> a negociation, withou previou&s;ly &s;ub|mitting his intentions and in&s;tructions to the &s;enate, requiring their advice, and receiving their a&s;&s;ent;" and the words of the con&s;titution "to make treaties, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate," are the text for this &s;trange commen|tary.</P>
<P>The extent of the po&s;ition is, "that the pre&s;ident has no power to enter into any negociation whatever, without previ|ou&s;ly con&s;ulting the &s;enate and receiving their opinion, advice, or a&s;&s;ent, as well with re&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a nego|ciation, as to the propriety of his in&s;tructions;" a po&s;ition, incon&s;i&s;tent with the very principles of our con&s;titution, as well as of every other among civilized nations; repugnant to the practice which has prevailed &s;ince the fir&s;t operation of the pre|&s;ent government, and to the practice which now prevails in France, where democratic principles are carried to the utmo&s;t extent; a po&s;ition which would reduce the pre&s;ident from being the &s;upreme executive of the union, to the mere organ and in&s;trument of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution "<HI>the executive power</HI> is ve&s;ted in the pre|&s;ident of the United States." Were there no limitation to this power, in relation to treaties, there would re&s;ult to the execu|tive, as &s;uch, the power of making treaties. But the con&s;titu|tion, in &s;pecifying the powers of the pre&s;ident, has wi&s;ely limited this power, and has declared, after mentioning the various duties of the pre&s;ident, &s;ome of which he may perform without the intervention of any other branch of the govern|ment, that "he &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, <HI>to make treaties.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="028389_0393_0FD8EB140A47D218">
This limitation of the executive power cannot be extended further than the clear import of the terms; it can apply only to the <HI>making</HI> of treaties, and not to <HI>the negociations</HI> which pre|cede them. The pre&s;ident may, therefore, of his own mere motion, commence or enter on any negociation, and give what in&s;tructions he may think proper to his agent; but the nego|ciation, when completed, cannot con&s;titute or make a treaty, which &s;hall be obligatory on the nation, without the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, that is, without they con&s;ent to the treaty which he &s;hall lay before them, and advi&s;e him to ratify it. This con&s;truction is the ju&s;t one, is con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and propriety, has been the con&s;truction put upon the con&s;ti|tution by the &s;enate them&s;elves, in all the treaties which have been made &s;ince the year 1789, under the pre&s;ent government, and is the practice e&s;tabli&s;hed even by the republic of France, where the committee of public &s;afety, their pre&s;ent executive, without con&s;ulting the convention, negociate with foreign pow|ers, and conclude treaties, which are afterwards laid before the convention, to be ratified, as appears by the report on the &s;ubject of negociations, by Cambaceres, lately publi&s;hed, and by their pro|ceedings in the treaties with the grand duke of Tu&s;cany and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. A contrary con&s;truction would be replete with difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, which would nearly prevent the formation of any treaty, or would deprive our government, in its negociations, of tho&s;e advantages of &s;ecrecy, di&s;patch, and the chance of events, which all other governments po&s;&s;e&s;s. The doc|trine laid down in the &s;peech is, that "no negociation can be com|menced, no in&s;truction can be given, without the previous con|&s;ultation and approbation of the &s;enate." In order to te&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> doctrine by the touch&s;tone of rea&s;on, let us enquire into in operation. The &s;enate con&s;i&s;ts of thirty members and the vice-pre&s;ident of the United States, re&s;iding in various parts of the union, in New Hamp&s;hire and Georgia, in Vermont and Kentucky, and, in a few years, will have members living in the province of Maine and in the South We&s;tern Territory: this body has, like the other branch of the legi&s;lature, its &s;tated annual &s;e&s;&s;ion, at the clo&s;e of which the members return to their re&s;pective homes and families. It is not a &s;tationary privy council to the pre&s;ident, re&s;iding at the &s;eat of government; and, except in the ca&s;es of con&s;enting to treaties and appoint|ments, it has no executive duties whatever to perform; it is, by the con&s;titution, a branch of the legi&s;lature; and is only added, as a re&s;traint on the executive, in the two ca&s;es men|tioned. Suppo&s;e, then, in&s;tructions &s;ubmitted to them by the pre&s;ident, in relation to a certain negociation, and approved
<PB N="107" REF="028389_0394_0FD8EB1599496768">and tran&s;mitted to Europe; various occurrences may, imme|diately on their arrival, require a change in them; the lo&s;s of a battle, the death of a king, the removal of a mini&s;ter, or other circum&s;tances intervening, to change the pre&s;ent po&s;ture and a&s;pect of affairs, may turn the tide of events, &s;o as to re|quire an entire change of in&s;tructions. As in the field, &s;o in the cabinet, there are moments to be &s;eized as they pa&s;s, and they who pre&s;ide in either, &s;hould be left in a capacity to im|prove them: to di&s;cern and to profit by the&s;e tides in national affairs, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who pre&s;ide over them. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;hould the pre&s;ident be required to convene the &s;enators, from the borders of the St. Croix to the St. Mary's, and from the Atlantic to the Ohio or lake Champlain, to re|con&s;ider and renew their in&s;tructions, it is evident, that the opportunity would be lo&s;t; &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in negociations, would be unattainable; and it would require ages to bring any treaty to a conclu&s;ion. Such a con&s;truction would be a <HI>felo de &s;e;</HI> for it would amount to this, that no treaties &s;hould ever be made; which was certainly not the in|tention of the con&s;titution. So often and &s;o e&s;&s;entially have we heretofore &s;uffered, from the want of &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, that the con&s;titution would have been inexcu&s;ably defective, if no attention had been paid to tho&s;e objects. Tho&s;e matters which, in negociations, u&s;ually require the mo&s;t &s;ecrecy and the mo&s;t di&s;patch, are tho&s;e preparatory mea&s;ures, which faci|litate the attainment of the objects of the negociation. The con|&s;titution has &s;o wi&s;ely di&s;po&s;ed of the power of making treaties, that, although the pre&s;ident mu&s;t, in concluding them, have the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, yet he can, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, have every advantage which may be derived from di&s;patch, &s;ecret intelli|gence, or change of events. Suppo&s;e, that, during the rece&s;s of the &s;enate, circum&s;tances in Europe were &s;uddenly to exi&s;t, which would offer a mo&s;t favorable opportunity for a treaty; if the pre&s;ident were re&s;trained from even in&s;tructing our mini&s;ters, on the &s;ubject of a future negociation, without convening the &s;enate, the opportunity would be irrecoverably gone; and the doctrine goes all the length of this; for it precludes the enter|ing on any negociation whatever, without the previous and preci&s;e in&s;tructions of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>Such would be the embarra&s;&s;ments and dangers re&s;ulting from that po&s;ition; on the other hand, by leaving it to the executive to negociate, and to the executive and &s;enate to con|clude, every advantage is &s;ecured, every di&s;advantage is avoid|ed; for, if the &s;enate do not approve of the treaty, they can reject it, and de&s;ire the pre&s;ident to renew the negociations:
<PB N="108" REF="028389_0395_0FD8EB19A19B0AE8">and this can be no po&s;&s;ible cau&s;e of war, as the &s;peech &s;up|po&s;es; for foreign nations, with whom we negociate, will know that the articles, &s;igned by the mini&s;ter, are of no effect, until ratified by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate; it is always expre&s;sly declared, that they &s;hall not be binding, until ratified by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate.</P>
<P>We find, then, by the con&s;titution, that <HI>the executive power is ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident;</HI> and I have advanced, that every power of an executive nature is incident to the pre&s;ident, where it re&s;ults from the nature of the federal government, and is not limited and re|&s;tricted by &s;ome &s;pecial provi&s;ion. The a&s;&s;ociation of the &s;enate with the pre&s;ident, in relation to this point, is limited <HI>merely</HI> to the <HI>making</HI> treaties, which are then the &s;upreme law of the land; and does not extend to the entering on, or commencing negocia|tions, which are <HI>not</HI> the law of the land, but mere in&s;truments of writing, mere obligations in embryo, which have no effect or validity, and do not become <HI>treaties,</HI> until approved by the &s;enate. The difference between <HI>commencing a negociation</HI> and <HI>making or concluding a treaty,</HI> is too obvious to be que&s;tioned: the limitation, then, being confined to the making or conclud|ing the treaty, all the other preparatory powers re&s;ult to the executive, as &s;uch, by virtue of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The opinion of congre&s;s in 1789, in an analogous ca&s;e, where the interpo&s;ition of the &s;enate was much more plau&s;ible than the pre&s;ent, may throw &s;ome light on this &s;ubject. A pro|po&s;ition was introduced by a member, who&s;e bias in favor of the mo&s;t democratic principles is well known; in which the power was given to the pre&s;ident, of removing all executive officers at his mere will and plea&s;ure. It was objected to, on the idea, that as, by the con&s;titution, the pre&s;ident could not appoint tho&s;e officers without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, &s;o it was intended by the con&s;titution, that he could not di&s;place them without the con&s;ent of that body; the various inconve|niencies which would flow from this con&s;truction were in re|ply enumerated; and it was urged, that, the con&s;titution be|ing &s;ilent on that point, the power nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulted to the pre&s;ident, as the executive power, it being an executive tru&s;t: on this principle, the motion pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and is now the law of the land.</P>
<P>The right of the &s;enate to advi&s;e the pre&s;ident to enter into a negociation, is a di&s;tinct que&s;tion, and not involved in the pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, and, therefore, unnece&s;&s;arily introduced; the only que&s;tion, pertinent to the &s;ubject, is, whether he may commence a negociation, without their advice; and of this the preceding reflections leave no doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="028389_0396_0FD8BE9B1E4ED9A0">
It is &s;aid in the &s;peech, that the right given to the pre&s;ident, So nominate to offices, has already placed in the hands of one man, all the honors and offices of the government; and that this is an unexampled power in any thing that had even the appearance of a free government.</P>
<P>If this power is a &s;alutary one, we &s;hould rejoice at his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it; if a pernicious one, why did the convention give it? who is to blame, but tho&s;e who created it&mdash;who &s;o much to blame, as tho&s;e who wi&s;hed his power to be out of the reach of the people for <HI>eight or ten</HI> years, in&s;tead of <HI>four?</HI> The conven|tion, &s;ome &s;ay, without authority, pre&s;ented us a con&s;titution which we were obliged to adopt or reject in toto, a govern|ment to bind us for ages: the pre&s;ident, by con&s;titutional au|thority, as has been &s;hown, pre&s;ented to the &s;enate a treaty, the mo&s;t injurious part of which mu&s;t expire in two or three years; which is the mo&s;t culpable? if there are dangerous powers in the con&s;titution, the convention, certainly, for cre|ating them, not the pre&s;ident for conforming to them. The nomination to offices is certainly a high tru&s;t; but it may be que&s;tioned, whether it gives the influence attributed to it: where there is one <HI>appointment,</HI> there are often a dozen <HI>di&s;ap|pointments</HI>&mdash;where one <HI>friend</HI> is made, a dozen <HI>enemies</HI> &s;pring up&mdash;and human experience would ju&s;tify us in &s;u&s;pecting, that <HI>di&s;appointments</HI> will have created more <HI>enemies</HI> to the pre&s;ident, <HI>on this occa&s;ion,</HI> than <HI>appointments</HI> have ever procured him <HI>friends.</HI> The remark, that the power is unexampled in any thing like a free government, is altogether erroneous. In Penn&s;ylvania, the governor makes all appointments, except &s;heriffs and co|roners, without any countroul. In New York, the gover|nor nominates nearly all officers to the council of appointment, con&s;i&s;ting only of four members, and has be&s;ides a ca&s;ting vote. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Vermont, and Maryland, the governor, with the con&s;ent of the council, makes nearly all appointments.</P>
<P>The opinions of Mr. <HI>Jay,</HI> are next animadverted on, in the &s;peech, as di&s;qualifying him from being a proper envoy to Eng|land. If Mr. Jay's &s;uppo&s;ed partiality to that country, and &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;like to France, were objections to his being &s;ent to Great Britain, undoubtedly Mr. Monroe's avowed partiality for France, and his avowed hatred of Great Britain, were at lea&s;t as powerful objections to <HI>his</HI> being &s;ent to France; yet Mr. Monroe was &s;elected by the pre&s;ident, for that very rea&s;on, and the choice was generally approved of. It did not follow, that, becau&s;e Mr. Monroe would have been willing, <HI>in the &s;enate,</HI> to have voted advantages to France, without any equivalent, that, in the execution of his tru&s;t, <HI>as envoy,</HI> he would not
<PB N="110" REF="028389_0397_0FD8EB1CCCFEEB68">have &s;tood out to &s;ecure us advantages by treaty; neither did it follow, that, becau&s;e Mr. Jay, like a con&s;cientious man, de|clared his opinions, as a judge, when his duty required it, he would not forego his own opinions, and, in pur&s;uance of his in&s;tructions, as an envoy, do the be&s;t he could for his country. in&s;tructions, as an envoy, do the be&s;t he could for his country. &mdash;According to the rea&s;oning in the &s;peech, Mr. Jay &s;hould have been &s;ent to France, becau&s;e his di&s;like to that country would have &s;timulated him to concede nothing to it, and to wring from it every thing he could; and Mr. Monroe to Eng|land, for &s;imilar rea&s;ons.&mdash;Others, however, who had more correct ideas on the &s;ubject, conceived, that this would have been an inver&s;ion of the natural order of things, and of the accu&s;tomed cour&s;e of diplomatic proceedings, which has been, to &s;end to foreign courts per&s;ons likely to be acceptable to them. Had Mr. Jay been &s;ent to France, and Mr. Monroe to England, the probability is, that both appointments would have given offence. More &s;tre&s;s, however, is laid on Mr. Jay's &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;like to France, than circum&s;tances would warrant. If Mr. Jay, in his negociations at Paris, in 1783, found the then mini&s;ter, Count de Vergennes, di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice the e&s;&s;en|tial intere&s;ts of the United States, to the then over-bearing policy of France&mdash;and, ten years afterwards, found citizen Genet (in 1793) at Philadelphia, trampling under foot the authority of the pre&s;ident, and the independence of our go|vernment&mdash;and, on both occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbati|on of their attempts&mdash;it does not thenceforth follow, that he bears any di&s;like to the French nation, or would be de&s;irous of engagements ho&s;tile to her intere&s;ts. Indeed, the care with which it is expre&s;sly declared, in the treaty with Great Britain, that no part of it &s;hall be con&s;trued, in any re&s;pect, to inter|fere with our former treaties, is a proof of a contrary di&s;po|&s;ition; and one of the highe&s;t panegyrics which has ever ap|peared on Mr. Jay, is from a Frenchman, celebrated for his republicani&s;m and patrioti&s;m, <HI>Bri&s;&s;ot.</HI> Neither does it follow, that opinions, expre&s;&s;ed by individuals at home, would preclude them, on foreign emba&s;&s;ies, from a&s;&s;erting claims, incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e opinions; if &s;o, <HI>Mr. Jeffer&s;on</HI> would have been a more improper negociator than Mr. Jay, on one of the mo&s;t important, and, to &s;ome, mo&s;t offen&s;ive parts of the treaty; for he had expre&s;sly and publicly recognized the right of the Briti&s;h nation to capture the property of their enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> board our &s;hips. But mini&s;ters &s;peak the language of their employers, and are governed by their in&s;tructions, to which their own private opinions always yield: there can be no doubt, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on would have exerted all his great talents to
<PB N="111" REF="028389_0398_0FD8EB1DCC7721B0">accompli&s;h that important point, of free &s;hips making free goods, notwith&s;tanding he had acknowledged the law of nations to be otherwi&s;e. The remark, therefore, that Mr. Jay <HI>was devoted to the intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h,</HI> is an unfounded calumny again&s;t a man, who, however mi&s;taken he may have been, in &s;acri|ficing too much to the pre&s;ervation of peace, or however he may have under-rated our &s;trength, or over-rated that of the other party, or however mi&s;informed or uninformed he may have been, is believed, by all who know him, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a pu|rity of mind and an integrity of heart, which cannot be affect|ed by the little attacks of private pique and re&s;entment, or di&s;appointed malignity; whatever opinions the public may en|tertain of his talents, certainly his yielding the point "free &s;hips not making free goods," which the &s;peech calls the wor&s;t part of the treaty, will not place him on a wor&s;e footing in the public e&s;timation, in the event contemplated by the &s;peech, than his &s;uppo&s;ed competitor, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who explicitly abandoned that point, when &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who&s;e parti|zans, in combination with all tho&s;e, whom Mr. Jay's ungra|cious manners have ever offended, eagerly avail them&s;elves of the pre&s;ent clamour, to build up the reputation of the one on the ruins of that of the other.</P>

<P>THE committee appointed at a town meeting, legally con|vened on Friday la&s;t, to take into con&s;ideration the treaty now pending between Great Britain and the United States, hav|ing reported their opinion thereon, it was Re&s;olved, That this meeting do approve &s;aid report; that a fair copy be made out; that it be &s;igned by the moderator, and that the town council of the town of Newport be reque&s;ted to tran&s;mit the &s;ame to the pre&s;ident of the United States without delay, as the &s;en&s;e of this meeting on &s;aid treaty, together with this re&s;olve.</P>

<P>The committee, to whom was referred, by their fellow citi|zens, the con&s;ideration of the treaty of amity, commerce, and
<PB N="112" REF="028389_0399_0FD8EB226C5A1870">navigation, now pending between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States, report, That they have con&s;idered the &s;aid treaty with attention, and di&s;approve of the &s;ame, for the fol|lowing rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts hath been very injurious to the United States, and for which no compen&s;ation is contemplated in &s;aid treaty.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the 3d, 13th, 15th, and 17th articles of the treaty, which regulate the trade, commerce, and navigation between Great Britain and the United States, are mo&s;t decidedly advan|tageous to the former, and will be very de&s;tructive to the com|merce and navigation of the latter.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the 4th and 5th articles render the boundaries of the United States, as &s;ettled by the treaty of 1783, doubtful, and may occa&s;ion a great lo&s;s of territory to the United States.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the demands of Briti&s;h creditors are fully attended to, and their complaints redre&s;&s;ed, agreeably to the &s;tipulation of the treaty of 1783; whereas the claims of the American citizens, for property carried away, by the Briti&s;h, in violation of the &s;ame treaty, are pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the mode pointed out for American citizens to ob|tain compen&s;ation for the &s;poliations committed on their com|merce, is remote, expen&s;ive, and uncertain; which in ju&s;tice, we conceive, ought to have been immediate and complete; whil&s;t the &s;tipulations for re&s;titution to be made by the United States, for the property taken by privateers equipped in &s;aid &s;tates, or captured within the limits thereof, is &s;peedy and energetic.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, by the 9th article, a privilege is be&s;towed on the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, in expre&s;&s;ion reciprocal, but, con&s;i|dering the difference in the circum&s;tances of the two nations, wanting an equivalent, and invading the rights of individual &s;tates.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we think it impolitic, to give up by treaty, the power of attaching Briti&s;h property in the United States, in ca&s;e of national differences and di&s;contents.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, in this treaty, certain articles of export are con&s;i|dered as contraband of war and ju&s;t objects of confi&s;cation, which, in our own treaties with other nations, are con&s;idered as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ree.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the 23d and 24th articles are calculated to embroil the United States with the French republic, and will probably make our &s;ea-ports the &s;cenes of riot and di&s;order. They al&s;o ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to make a common cau&s;e between the United States and Great Britain, and to di&s;tre&s;s our allies.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="028389_0400_0FD8EB2610F31898">

<HEAD>FROM THE BOSTON CHRONICLE. Ob&s;ervations on Treaties.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Me&s;&s;rs. Adams and Larkin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST reque&s;t the attention of the public, through the medium of your <HI>Chronicle,</HI> to the following pa&s;&s;age in the federal con&s;titution; it is in the 2d &s;ection of the &s;ixth article. It provides, "that this con&s;titution and the laws of the United States, made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties <HI>made,</HI> or which <HI>&s;hall</HI> be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land; and the judges, in every &s;tate, &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of <HI>any &s;tate,</HI> to the contrary, notwith&s;tanding."</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be vi&s;ible, from this pa&s;&s;age, that treaties &s;tand pre|ci&s;ely on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> footing with <HI>other</HI> laws, and have no au|thority <HI>over</HI> them. They are &s;upreme, nor as they refer to the
<PB N="114" REF="028389_0401_0FD8EB278A491268">federal con&s;titution, but &s;imply in their relation to the con&s;ti|tutions and laws of any &s;tate; and the judges are directed thus to con&s;ider them. How far they may be extended, &s;o as to al|ter the local con&s;titution, is a very delicate que&s;tion, and of great importance to be con&s;idered; for if their power extends to the full length which the pre&s;ident &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, in his an&s;wer to the town of Bo&s;ton, there is not a government in the union, the con&s;titution of which does not lie at the <HI>mercy</HI> of the executive power, &s;upported by two-thirds of the &s;ena|tors, provided the republican form is retained. The federal con&s;titution, it is true, has guaranteed a republican con&s;titution to every &s;tate in the union; but this provi&s;ion is extremely vague and indefinite. Republican forms of government may be more tyrannic than monarchical. The governments of Hol|land and Venice, were not &s;o free as the ancient government of France, or the pre&s;ent government of England.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of two-thirds of the federal &s;enators, has an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> power to make treaties, they may &s;weep away all the laws and con&s;titutions of the &s;everal &s;tates, without any check from the one I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>Every body knows, that the federal con&s;titution, at the time of its being propo&s;ed, was not fully approved by a large majority of the people; although it was then adopted, from the pre&s;umed nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome form of government being ac|cepted at that period. The power, with re&s;pect to treaties, was not then under&s;tood; it was acknowledged by its friends, to have been a mere appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of the citi|zens, on a fair experiment of its merits. It admits of im|provement and alteration, by an article in&s;erted in it. If the con&s;truction of that article by the pre&s;ident, re&s;pecting his power to make treaties, be ju&s;t, it is high time the inhabitants &s;hould demand a revi&s;ion of the federal compact&mdash;that new checks &s;hould be provided, to re&s;train this exorbitant power.</P>
<P>But if the pre&s;ident, with two-thirds of the &s;enators, are now ve&s;ted with an ab&s;olute, uncontrouled right to make trea|ties, obligatory to the utmo&s;t extent, what then are the powers to re&s;train them? It is provided, in the fir&s;t article of the fede|ral con&s;titution, that the congre&s;s <HI>"&s;hall"</HI> regulate foreign trade. The Engli&s;h trade is a material part of our foreign commerce. The treaty, which the pre&s;ident has ratified, virtually declares, that the congre&s;s &s;hall <HI>not</HI> in future regulate our trade with Great Britain. The con&s;titution provides al&s;o, that the legi&s;la|ture <HI>&s;hall</HI> regulate our trade with the Indian nations; may not the pre&s;ident and &s;enate make &s;uch a treaty as &s;hall al&s;o wre&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="028389_0402_0FD8EB29155695E0">that important privilege from the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and thus monopolize all the patronage and benefits annexed to it?</P>
<P>Either the treaty is con&s;titutional, or <HI>not;</HI> if the latter, it is a nullity; if the former, the powers of the whole congre&s;s can be controuled, and even annihilated, by a part.</P>
<P>Under the old confederation, we were di&s;tingui&s;hed by our imbecility at home, but we appeared with dignity abroad. In our diplomatic arrangements with foreign nations, we certain|ly were infinitely &s;uperior to what we had a right to expect. We were then in our childhood, and yet the vigour of our policy had the &s;tamp of adole&s;cence. Every treaty we <HI>then</HI> form|ed, and we formed four with four of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nations in Europe&mdash;with France, with Holland, with Pru&s;&s;ia, and with Sweden&mdash;recognized the rights of a free trade, as an e&s;&s;ential claim, re&s;ulting from our independence, as a nation, and of our remote &s;ituation from the vortex of the European politics, in which we were determined never to be involved. But how contrary is this conduct to our pre&s;ent! While the right of a free navigation is maintained in tho&s;e national en|gagements, to the utmo&s;t latitude, our late treaty with England has &s;et them all a&s;ide, and placed our navigation on &s;o preca|rious an e&s;tabli&s;hment, that nothing but the di&s;tre&s;&s;es or ge|nero&s;ity of the French republic can &s;ave us from total ruin. In this late &s;pecimen of out talents in negociation, we have counter-worked, at a &s;troke, all we have been doing from the fir&s;t moment of the revelation. What will hinder the French from taking the &s;ame freedom with our trade which the Bri|ti&s;h are now taking every moment?</P>
<P>Before this treaty, we had nece&s;&s;ity to plead; but we have now con&s;ented to permit the exerci&s;e of a power over our navigation, which has never yet been acknowledged by a na|tion. The Briti&s;h now have a right, by compact, &s;igned and &s;ealed, to every thing they wi&s;hed to do, and infinitely more than they ever expected to obtain. They are permitted to take our provi&s;ions bound to France; will not, then, the French take our provi&s;ions bound to England, Spain, and Portugal? The Briti&s;h are permitted to take and condemn all our naval &s;tores, found in our ve&s;&s;els; will not the French and Dutch claim the &s;ame privilege? The Briti&s;h are permitted to take and condemn French goods in American bottoms; will not the French and Dutch crui&s;ers take and condemn all Engli&s;h goods, in the &s;ame manner? It is well known, that nearly all outward bound commodities, of the growth or manufacture of Great Britain, are &s;hipped on credit to the&s;e &s;tates, and are
<PB N="116" REF="028389_0403_0FD8EB308CC345E0">in&s;ured in England previous to their exportation. All the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els are thus rendered liable to capture, and the goods to con|demnation. For every treaty with the powers enumerated, &s;tipulates, with great preci&s;ion, that no future privilege &s;hall be extended to another nation, which &s;hall not equally extend to them. If this be the ca&s;e, and I have no doubt of it, and the republic is not re&s;trained by more than common genero&s;ity, &s;he will do as the Briti&s;h do; their conduct will be her rule; and our blind confidence in our pre&s;ent corrupt policy, will be re|warded by an extent and variety of &s;ufferings beyond example.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks on the Vth Article of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>IN the treaty announced in the public papers, between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States; it appears by ar|ticle the 5th, that the river St. Croix, our ea&s;tern boundary, is to be a&s;certained by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed in the manner fol|lowing: "One commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall be named by his maje&s;ty, and one by the pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the con&s;ent of the &s;enate thereof; and the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall agree on the choice of a third, or, if they cannot &s;o agree, they &s;hall each propo&s;e one per&s;on, and of the two names &s;o propo&s;ed, one &s;hall be drawn by lot, in the pre&s;ence of the two commi&s;&s;ioners." Not being pre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor informed, what notice was taken of this part, at the late meeting of the inhabitants of this town, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t a few hints, on this &s;ubject, by one who has endeavoured for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to obtain information re&s;pecting the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The mode of &s;ettlement &s;eems more like a reference, or ar|bitration; with this difference, that, like a lottery, it will p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ponderate on the &s;ide, which draws the lucky prize, and, of cour&s;e, will give force and &s;anction to the claim.</P>
<P>It is a fact, incontrovertible, that the Ea&s;tern River of Pa&s;&s;a|maquady, called by the Indians, Mag-ga-gau-da-wick, was known by public notoriety, for the two la&s;t centuries, as the true St. Croix. There are records of a &s;ettlement made between the courts of Ver&s;ailles and St. James, about the years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and 1622, e&s;tablithing this river; and the &s;everal treaties between
<PB N="117" REF="028389_0404_0FD8EB351B37F8C8">the two nations, until Nova Scotia was la&s;t ceded to Britain, confirmed it. Since which, &s;ome local di&s;putes aro&s;e between Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Nova Scotia, but were always terminated the &s;ame way. Even during the admini&s;tration of Governor Bernard, who was well known never to favor the intere&s;t of this country, it was then proved by indi&s;putable evidence to be the veritable St. Croix; and though it is not e&s;&s;ential, in this ca&s;e, &s;till it may be ob&s;erved, that when the Royali&s;ts moved from Penob&s;cot to St. Andrews, the entrance of Shuduck river) in 1783, it was publicly noticed among them&s;elves, as pre&s;umptuous, being uncertain of a right in &s;o doing. What has been done, &s;ince the revolution, on this &s;ubject, is too re|cent, and &s;o well known, it needs no comment.</P>
<P>Thus the boundaries were, and ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Con|&s;equently that valuable extent of territory, which lies between the &s;aid St. Croix, and the river Shuduck (which the Briti&s;h now call the boundary) is the indubitable right of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts.</P>
<P>As this article in the treaty now &s;tands, the claim is made equal; &s;o that &s;hould the commi&s;&s;ioner on the &s;ide of the United States draw the per&s;on he propo&s;es, we may have a chance to &s;ecure what was before our own&mdash;if, on the other hand, the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioner draws the per&s;on, Britain obtains a pro|perty, &s;he has no title to, &s;eparate from her connections with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it may be ea&s;y to con|clude, that tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, or arbitrators, &s;hould have been independent, di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;ons, unconnected with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;pute; authorized to hear both parties, and determine accord|ingly; but if it is executed under the pre&s;ent&mdash;it is like a man who takes a pur&s;e of money from his pocket, lays it on the table, and calls to another to draw lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s who &s;hall have it.</P>
<P>The author of this is no way influenced by any per&s;on or party, but writes from a full conviction of the importance of the &s;ubject to this country. He pre&s;umes that from inadvertence, or imperfect information, this part has not been properly at|tended to, and relies, that, in due time, &s;uch attention will be paid to the object in contemplation, that our country may not be deceived, and deprived of any of tho&s;e advantages and rights, which, in ju&s;tice, are its due.</P>

<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not difficult to fore&s;ee that the treaty with Great Bri|tain would excite much public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion&mdash;It is only to be lamented, that the knowledge of it has been withheld &s;o lon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that the inve&s;tigation can now an&s;wer no other valuable pur|po&s;e, than to bring the pre&s;ident acquainted with the &s;entime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his fellow citizens. It was al&s;o ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that the lead|ers of a certain party would &s;trenuou&s;ly advocate every article.

The&s;e e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> have &s;ucceeded too well; twenty &s;enators have agreed to all but one article. I &s;hall make no reflection on the&s;e gentlemen, who for this purpo&s;e were a bare majority. But the manner in which the bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted, leaves too much room to fear, that the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of our country have been &s;acrificed to gratify party zeal. It is, certainly, &s;omewhat extraordinary, that long before the treaty was known, the vote of each of the&s;e gentlemen was reckoned upon with the utmo&s;t certainty.&mdash;It is not my intention to acquit tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the treaty from their &s;hare of this baneful &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The cen&s;ure of many is accompanied with too much acri|mony. There is, however, another cla&s;s, who will probably decide upon its merits: I mean the moderate men, and real patriots, who, &s;corning to be be led by others, will take th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="119" REF="028389_0406_0FD8EB380F5D4210">trouble of judging for them&s;elves. To per&s;ons of this de&s;crip|tion, the&s;e remarks will be addre&s;&s;ed. Previous to di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the treaty it&s;elf, we mu&s;t not pa&s;s unnoticed the my&s;terious &s;ecrecy which has inveloped a tran&s;action of the la&s;t moment to the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of America.&mdash;Is not this &s;ecrecy, alone, a proof that the &s;enate conceived it di&s;graceful and pre|judicial to the United States? The public clamour which they &s;aw would be excited, might have deferred them from the har|dy &s;tep of giving it their a&s;&s;ent; whereas, they well knew, that if it was not divulged until ratified, many, who might have been violent in their oppo&s;ition, would, as good citizens, &s;ubmit to it as &s;oon as it became the &s;upreme law of the land. There might be a propriety in the &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved by the pre&s;i|dent; but the &s;enate ought to have afforded the public the &s;ame opportunity of judging of it, which they have of canva&s;&s;ing every bill in its pa&s;&s;age towards a law. In&s;tead of this, they take care that no part of it &s;hall tran&s;pire, except the time limited for the &s;urrendering the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and that &s;ome kind of provi&s;ion was made for indemnifying our merchants. Neither Governor Jay, nor the &s;enate, were at any pains to conceal the&s;e points of the treaty, while they carefully with|held the &s;acrifices which were to be the price of tho&s;e benefits. The &s;enate, indeed, go further, and, as if afraid or a&s;hamed of what they had done, enjoin their members, even after their act of ratification, not to make any part of it public; and Mr. Ma&s;on, who de&s;erves the thanks of his country, is cen&s;ured for di&s;regarding an injunction, which was nugatory in its na|ture, and reflected no great honor on the legi&s;lature of a free people.</P>
<P>Another preliminary remark may be made here, as it will a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of this convention. It is this, the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions made by the peru&s;al of it, were univer&s;ally un|favorable; all men, and all ranks, united in condemning it&mdash; A gloom, co-exten&s;ive with its circulation, took place.&mdash;Tho&s;e who were &s;ilent as to its defects, could not forbear to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that it had never been made, and readily agreed, that we &s;hould be much better without it. Had a petition immedi|ately been prepared to be pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ident, again&s;t its ratification, nine merchants in ten would have &s;igned it: and not a mechanic would have refu&s;ed. When the people with one voice condemn a mea&s;ure, of which they are competent judges, it furni&s;hes a violent pre&s;umption again&s;t the expediency of it.</P>
<P>This general clamour, and di&s;content alarmed the envoy, and tho&s;e, who had predetermined to &s;upport him. Recour&s;e was had to their u&s;ual indu&s;try and arts. Some took their &s;tand at the
<PB N="120" REF="028389_0407_0FD8EB3994B24B48">coffee hou&s;es, others ran about the &s;treets; but notwith&s;tanding their diligence, the mo&s;t vigorous exertions and prudent con|duct on the part of its opponents, were nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Mr. Jay's effigy and the fruits of his negociation from being con&s;igned to the flames in one part of the city,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New York.</NOTE> while the Bri|ti&s;h merchants were fea&s;ting him in another.</P>
<P>We come now to the treaty. The preamble it&s;elf, is not free from objection. The differences between the two countries are to be terminated "without reference to the merits of their complaints." This is &s;urely an unprecedented mode of &s;etting public or private controver&s;ies (e&s;pecially in the time of peace) the merits of which &s;hould never be lo&s;t &s;ight of, and ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> form the ba&s;is of a &s;ettlement. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee why Great Bri|tain wi&s;hed to keep them out of &s;ight.&mdash;Whoever reads the cor|re&s;pondence between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Hammond, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> admit, that the former has, in a &s;atisfactory, candid, and ele|gant manner, an&s;wered every excu&s;e made by the Briti&s;h, for their non-execution of the treaty of peace.

<P>The &s;econd article would have been better and le&s;s liable to future difficulty and con&s;truction, if it had defined particularly from what places his maje&s;ty was to withdraw his troops, in|&s;tead of &s;aying generally from within the boundary "lines a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace:" for it appears, that tho&s;e very lines are a matter in di&s;pute, and hereafter to be &s;ettled.
<PB N="121" REF="028389_0408_0FD8EB3FF34F96F0">As this boundary will, certainly, not be adju&s;ted by next June, it will furni&s;h a pretext for holding tho&s;e &s;orts a few years long|er, and put us to the expen&s;e of a &s;econd emba&s;&s;y. Why not declare, that Michillimackinac, Detroit, Niagara, O&s;wego, O&s;wegatche, Point-au-&s;er, Dutchman's point, &amp;c. &s;hould be delivered up? This would have been explicit; but, as we pro|gre&s;s, we &s;hall find, that preci&s;ion and per&s;picuity are not very &s;triking features in this mini&s;terial lucubration. The time limit|ed for their evacuations is another objection to the article; it is too remote to hope for its performance. If peace takes place this &s;ummer, none will be &s;urpri&s;ed if Great Britain continues her garri&s;ons where they now are!

It is in the&s;e words, "except with|in the precincts or juri&s;diction of any of the &s;aid po&s;ts:" who is to determine, how far this juri&s;diction may extend?

<HEAD>Article III.</HEAD>
<P>The advantages conceded to Great Britain, by the third ar|ticle, are much greater than tho&s;e which we derive in return. Con&s;idering the extent of the United States, it is evident, that the mutual liberty here granted, to pa&s;s by land or inland na|vigation into each other's re&s;pective territories, upon this con|tinent, is a much greater acqui&s;ition to Great Britain than to us; not only the territory of the former is &s;mall, when com|pared with our own, but the whole fur trade, which we might have &s;ecured to our&s;elves, will now not only be participated by, but probably fall altogether into the hands of, Briti&s;h tra|ders, notwith&s;tanding our country is much more exten&s;ive, and our rivers and lakes more numerous, than tho&s;e of Great Britain, into all of which &s;he has free admi&s;&s;ion; the latter has taken care, very unju&s;tly, to exclude our ve&s;&s;els from the "&s;ea-ports, harbours, bays, and creeks of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories," and al&s;o from "&s;uch parts of the rivers as are between the mouths thereof and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading between Montreal and Quebec." Where is the con&s;ideration for this manife&s;t in|equality?
<PB N="122" REF="028389_0409_0FD8EB434B4C0B48">A Briti&s;h trader may &s;et out from Canada, traver&s;e our lakes, and pa&s;s with his merchandize down the Hud&s;on or Delaware to New York or Philadelphia, with his own ve&s;&s;el. Why ought we not, in return, to have the free navigation of the Saint Lawrence and other Briti&s;h rivers? In&s;tead of this, we are &s;topped, in our pa&s;&s;age down, at the highe&s;t port of entry, and mu&s;t there hire Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els to pur&s;ue our voyage, or &s;ell our cargoes for the be&s;t price we can get.</P>
<P>There is a curious provi&s;o, in this article, which de&s;erves notice. Upon a cur&s;ory reading, it appears to lay Great Bri|tain under a &s;imilar re&s;traint, but the lea&s;t attention will di&s;|cover this not to be the ca&s;e. It is this, "<HI>Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea</HI> are not to be admitted into our rivers beyond the high|e&s;t port of entry for ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea." What can Great Britain wi&s;h for more? <HI>would her &s;ea ve&s;&s;els</HI> ever attempt, if permitted, to go further than the highe&s;t port of entry.</P>
<P>That part of this article, which interdicts the laying of duties on peltries brought by land or inland navigation, is al&s;o highly unequal and di&s;advantageous to America.

<HEAD>Article VI.</HEAD>
<P>The mode of adju&s;ting the &s;um due to Briti&s;h creditors, agreeably to the &s;ixth article, will be unju&s;t towards tho&s;e &s;tates which have interpo&s;ed no lawful impediments in the way of recovering &s;uch debts, as they mu&s;t al&s;o bear part of the burden, and thus &s;uffer for the delinquency of others. Who|ever reads Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Mr. Hammond, of the 29th May, 1792, will acquit the United States of much, if not of the whole of the cen&s;ure which has been &s;o liberally be&s;towed by Great Britain, for the non-payment of Briti&s;h debts, which has been urged in excu&s;e by her, for the infractions of a treaty, which were committed long before &s;he could have known what America had done, or would do, upon this head. Mr. Jeffer&s;on has taken infinite pains to inve&s;tigate this
<PB N="123" REF="028389_0410_0FD8EB4513C26150">matter, which he has done not only like a &s;tate&s;man, but a con&s;ummate lawyer. It re&s;ults, from his re&s;earches, that, Great Britain having broken the treaty, by a refu&s;al to evacu|ate the upper po&s;ts, and carrying away more than three thou|&s;and negroes, &s;ome of the &s;tates, urged by dire nece&s;&s;ity, and the calamities of a long war, only modified the recovery of debts&mdash;

<ITEM>4. That, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e regulations, which were moderate and of &s;hort duration, it was at all times perfectly under&s;tood, that treaties controuled the laws of the &s;tate. That the federal and &s;tate judiciaries have &s;o decided; that, upon this principle, the courts are every where open to Briti&s;h credi|tors, who have been, for &s;ome time, in the habit of recovering their debts at law.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tatements, and the deductions of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, are &s;upported by the opinion of &s;ome of the fir&s;t lawyers in the different &s;tates, which are &s;ubjoined to his letter. If, then, no lawful impediment exi&s;ts in the way of the&s;e debts, why not leave the creditors to the ordinary cour&s;e of law, and why fix a &s;tigma on the United States, by providing for an infraction of the treaty of peace on their part, which, at pre&s;ent does not exi&s;t. Great Britain was unwilling to omit &s;o favorable an opportunity of extorting from our mini&s;ter a conce&s;&s;ion, of which &s;he will, one day or another, make proper u&s;e. It is al&s;o to be regretted, that the article of intere&s;t has been pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>&s;ub &s;i|lentio,</HI> in this part of the treaty.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on has &s;hown, in the letter alluded to, that inte|re&s;t, being no part of the debt, may be di&s;allowed in many ca&s;es, and has cited a great variety of in&s;tances, from Engli&s;h law-books, in which it is not given; &s;ome of which apply with too much force to the &s;ituation of the parties in que&s;tion, not to be mentioned. He ob&s;erves, that a great national cala|mity has been adjudged a &s;ufficient cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pend the pay|ment of intere&s;t; that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the law of the creditor party had cut off the per&s;onal acce&s;s of his debtor; that the tran&s;portation of his produce or money to the country of his creditor was interdicted; that, where the creditor pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nts payment of both principle and intere&s;t, the latter, at lea&s;t,

<P>The declarations of congre&s;s and our plenipotentiaries, previous to the definitive treaty, and the &s;ilence of that in|&s;trument, afford proof, that intere&s;t was not intended on our part, nor in&s;i&s;ted upon by the other; and that, upon the whole, it was the proper province of the judiciary to determine in what ca&s;es intere&s;t ought or ought not to be allowed.</P>
<P>If the&s;e po&s;itions of Mr. Jeffer&s;on be defen&s;ible, we cannot but wi&s;h that this article had been more explicit, as too much is now left to the di&s;cretion of commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ome, and perhaps a majority of whom, will be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and even Briti&s;h creditors.</P>

<P>THE &s;eventh article is wholly exceptionable. It places at too great a di&s;tance, the compen&s;ation to which our citizens are entitled, for the mo&s;t unheard-of and atrocious acts of piracy; they are thus not only kept out of a large part of their capitals, for a long time, but any &s;pecies of re&s;titution becomes extremely precarious and problematical. The captures being, in many ca&s;es, admitted to be unju&s;t, the Briti&s;h go|vernment &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have advanced a &s;um on account, to be di&s;tributed immediately among tho&s;e who had &s;uffered. Ne|ver was a claim better founded; never was time more favorable to enforce it: if Great Britain can procra&s;tinate, until a peace, the &s;ettlement of her depredations, her views will be an&s;wered.

<P>This article infringes the rights of the different States, and impairs the obligation of private contracts; nor is it reciprocal, except in appearance and on paper. It has long been the poli|cy of the Engli&s;h law to exclude aliens from holding real e&s;tates of inheritance. We have pur&s;ued this policy, and the rea&s;ons, a&s;&s;igned by Black&s;tone, apply much more forcibly to America, than to his own country.&mdash;"If," &s;ays he, "an ali|en could acquire a permanent property in lands, he mu&s;t owe an allegiance, equally permanent with that property, to the king of England, which would probably be incon&s;i&s;tent with that which he owes to his own natural liege lord: be&s;ides, that <HI>thereby the nation might, in time, be &s;ubject to foreign influence, and feel many other inconveniencies.</HI>" Con&s;idering the population of Great Britain, and the energy of her government, &s;upported by a &s;tanding army, there can be no great danger, at pre&s;ent, from a relaxation, on her part, in this principle; but with a country, who&s;e population is as thin as ours, and who&s;e go|vernment is yet in its infancy, too great care cannot be in|terpo&s;ed to prevent the influence which the too ea&s;y acqui&s;ition of real property cannot fail to give to foreigners. I am aware, that this article does not extend to future purcha&s;es; but, even limited as it is, it is unju&s;t and unequal. Unequal, becau&s;e no American has been hardy enough to purcha&s;e real e&s;tates in Great Britain, while millions of acres are held by her &s;ubjects in this country, who knew, at the time of the purcha&s;es, the ri&s;k which they ran in making them. Unju&s;t&mdash;becau&s;e, if the pre&s;ent proprietor be an alien, the land is already forfeit|ed to the &s;tate which originally granted it, "by way of pu|ni&s;hing him," &s;ays Black&s;tone, "for his pre&s;umption, in at|tempting to acquire any landed property;" or, which will be yet a harder ca&s;e, it may have already been granted to &s;ome of her citizens. In either ca&s;e, it is not ea&s;y to conceive upon what principle &s;uch a &s;tipulation could find place in a

<P>THIS article, like many others, has the appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reciprocity; but when the &s;ituation of the two countries is attended to, this apparent equality vani&s;hes, and Great Bri|tain alone derives advantage from it. It provides, that "neither the debts due from individuals of one nation to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war or national differences, be &s;eque&s;tered or con|fi&s;cated." The advocates of this clau&s;e contend, that it is unju&s;t and impolitic, that &s;uch confi&s;cations &s;hould ever take place, and that, therefore, America has conceded nothing. This is begging the que&s;tion; for if it can be proved to be lawful, ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and politic, to &s;eque&s;ter to the public u&s;e, property in this &s;itu|ation, it may rea&s;onably be a&s;ked, why have the United <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> agreed to ab&s;tain from it without an equivalent on the part of Great Britain. It is true, Great Britain promi&s;es the &s;ame for|bearance on her part; but upon a moment's reflection, it will occur, that this promi&s;e, even if <HI>ob&s;erved,</HI> is in reality no con|&s;ideration. Millions are due to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain from the government and from individuals of the United States while, comparatively &s;peaking, our citizens hold nothing in the Briti&s;h funds or banks, and have few, if any demands upon the &s;ubjects of that nation. Let us now examine the right of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nation in this re&s;pect. Bynker&s;hook, and mo&s;t re&s;pectable writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on this &s;ubject, recognizes the right of a nation to &s;eize the property of its enemies found within its own limits in whatever form it exi&s;ts, whether in action or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The following i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a liberal tran&s;lation of his own words. "Since it is a condition of war, that enemies may be deprived of all their rights, it is rea&s;onable that every thing of an enemy found among his ene|mies, &s;hould <HI>change its owner and go to the trea&s;ury.</HI> It is, more|over, u&s;ually directed, in all declarations of war, that the goods of enemies, as well tho&s;e found among us, as tho&s;e taken in war, &s;hall be confi&s;cated. If we follow the mere right of war, even <HI>immoveable</HI> property may be &s;old, and its price carried into the trea&s;ury, as is the cu&s;tom with moveable property. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> almo&s;t all Europe, it is only notified that their profits during the war &s;hall be received by the trea&s;ury; and the war being ended, the immoveable property it&s;elf is re&s;tored by agreement to the former owner." Que&s;t. Jur. pub. lib. ch. 7. And again, in the &s;ame chapter, "what I have &s;aid of things <HI>in action</HI> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="129" REF="028389_0416_0FD8EB578A89C4E8">rightly confi&s;cated, holds thus, if the prince really exacts from his &s;ubjects what they owed to his enemies, it is <HI>rightfully</HI> paid; if he &s;hall not have exacted it, peace being made, the former right of the creditor revives. Accordingly, it is for the mo&s;t part agreed among nations, that things in action being confi&s;|cated in war, the peace being made, tho&s;e which were paid are deemed to have peri&s;hed, and remain extinct, but tho&s;e not paid revive, and are re&s;tored to their true creditors." The doc|trine of Vattel accords with that already cited. "He who de|clares war," &s;ays he, "does not confi&s;cate the immoveable goods po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his country by his enemy's &s;ubjects. In per|mitting them to purcha&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;s them, he has, in this re&s;pect, admitted them into the number of his &s;ubjects; but the income may be &s;eque&s;trated for hindering the remittance of it to the enemy's country." And again, "when Alexander by conque&s;t became ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Thebes, he remitted to the The&s;&s;alians, an hundred talents, which they owed to the The|bans. The &s;overeign has naturally the &s;ame right over what his &s;ubjects may be indebted to his enemies. <HI>Therefore he may con|fi&s;cate debts of this nature,</HI> if the term of payment happens in the time of war; or at lea&s;t he may prohibit his &s;ubjects from paying while the war la&s;ts." Book III. chap. V.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on, al&s;o, who is not apt to advocate a doctrine merely becau&s;e it &s;uits his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, when &s;peaking of the rightful acts of war, &s;ays, "It cannot be denied, that the &s;tate of war &s;trictly permits a nation to &s;eize the property of its enemies found within its own limits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exi&s;ts, whether in <HI>action or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI>" I &s;hall not conceal, that, although this practice is &s;trictly permitted by the laws of nations; yet tho&s;e &s;overeigns of Europe, who act with good faith, have generally departed from this right, &s;o far, that public funds are generally exempted from confi&s;cation, and &s;eizure. Great Britain, however, regardle&s;s of the conduct of other nations, has, if we are rightly informed, confi&s;cated or &s;eque&s;trated, during the pre&s;ent war, debts of both the&s;e de|&s;criptions; although Vattel &s;ays, that a &s;tate ought never to touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy. From what has been &s;aid, it re&s;ults, that the United States, in ca&s;e of a war with Great Britain, have an undoubted right to confi&s;cate any debts due by their citizens to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, and that if they choo&s;e to adopt the conduct of that nation, they might confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter the property which they hold in our funds.</P>
<P>Indeed this right, in its fulle&s;t latitude, may fairly be con|tended for, from the care which Lord Grenville has taken to
<PB N="130" REF="028389_0417_0FD8EB59CE10DC50">re&s;train the exerci&s;e of it. It is worthy of remark, by the 21&s;t article of the treaty lately made between the French and Dutch republics, it is agreed, "That the French republic &s;hall u&s;e their good offices with foreign powers in favor of the United Provinces, in order to obtain payment of the &s;ums due them before the war."&mdash;And in an Engli&s;h mini&s;terial paper, pub|li&s;hed &s;ince this treaty, it is &s;aid, "that the declaration of war, on the part of the Dutch, is con&s;idered, at the pre&s;ent moment, as by no means unfavorable for the intere&s;ts of England; as it furni&s;hes her with the be&s;t rea&s;ons <HI>for confi&s;cating an immen&s;e property in that country belonging to Holland.</HI>"</P>
<P>If then it be &s;trictly permitted to &s;eque&s;ter and confi&s;cate pro|perty of this &s;pecies, why &s;urrender the right without an equi|valent? Why give up this powerful means of &s;elf-defence, and that to a nation, who, from the fir&s;t moment of her being obliged to acknowledge our independence, has treated us with the mo&s;t per&s;evering contempt? "It is with concern" &s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on in his letter to Mr. Pinckney, "I am obliged to ob&s;erve, that &s;o marked has been the inattention of the Briti&s;h court to every application which has been made to them on any &s;ubject by this government (not a &s;ingle an&s;wer, I believe hav|ing ever been given to one of them, except in the act of exchang|ing a mini&s;ter) that it may become unavoidable in certain ca&s;es, where an an&s;wer of &s;ome &s;ort is nece&s;&s;ary, to con&s;ider their &s;ilence as an an&s;wer." Why then, I repeat, &s;hould we &s;urrender to &s;uch a nation the mo&s;t powerful weapon of defence which is placed in our hands? Is it unju&s;t or impolitic to confi&s;cate the property of a nation, which, without any pretence, plun|ders us of ours on the high &s;eas? Is it not more unju&s;t and im|politic to lay our citizens at their mercy? For &s;uch mu&s;t now be their unfortunate &s;ituation, as we have parted with the only means of making them retribution. It is well known, what a powerful effect was produced in England by the bare propo&s;al to &s;eque&s;ter the Briti&s;h debts. The clamour excited again&s;t the mini&s;try, by the per&s;ons who would have been immediately af|fected by it, produced a revocation of &s;ome of the obnoxious edicts of which we complained. And yet, as if our fleets were able to cope with tho&s;e of Great-Britain, and protect our trade, we have voluntarily, and without con&s;ideration, &s;acrificed this powerful engine of defence and terror, although it was almo&s;t the only effectual one within our power. If in any ca&s;e, it be impolitic or unju&s;t, we can forbear on &s;uch occa&s;ions to exer|ci&s;e the right; and we might then de&s;erve &s;ome credit for our forbearance; but when bound by treaty to forego, much of the

<P>One ob&s;ervation more, and I have done with this article. The &s;ecure footing upon which bank &s;tock is placed by it, will render, it an object with the king of Great Britain, as a &s;ource of influence, as well as of intere&s;t. He had already &s;peculated in our funds. It will not, therefore, be &s;urpri&s;ing, if, after this, he or his mini&s;ter &s;hould inve&s;t a very large &s;um in this way; nay, what is to prevent him, con&s;idering the length of his pur&s;e, from engro&s;&s;ing all the &s;hares of the&s;e different in&s;ti|tutions which have multiplied &s;o wonderfully &s;ince the peace, or at lea&s;t a &s;ufficient number to &s;ecure the uncontrouled direc|tion of them? I leave it to others to picture the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and ab|ject &s;ituation of our country, &s;hould her whole capital be admi|ni&s;tered by his Britannic maje&s;ty, or by tho&s;e of his appointment. How will our public operations be cramped in time of war, or upon any &s;udden emergency, &s;hould his maje&s;ty deem it inex|pedient to accommodate the government with a loan, at the &s;ame time, by withholding from our citizens put it out of their power to &s;upply her wants? Even, in time of peace, it mu&s;t be humiliating to an American to be obliged to Briti&s;h directors for a loan. They will, &s;ometimes, no doubt, be mo&s;t graciou&s;ly accommodated with a &s;mall &s;um, provided there be more than &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the extravagant demands of his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t loving &s;ubjects. The&s;e evils may appear to &s;ome, di&s;tant and chimerical. Some, however, are already felt; for of what countrymen are the directors generally compo&s;ed? and others will follow a ratification of the treaty, as naturally as an effect does its cau&s;e. I am aware, that in the bank of the United States, and in &s;ome others, a non-re&s;ident &s;tockholder cannot give his vote by proxy for a director. This difficulty will ea&s;ily be obviated, not indeed by his maje&s;ty's per&s;onal attendance, although &s;uch a vi&s;it might not be impolitic, but by holding this &s;pecies of &s;tock in the name of his amba&s;&s;ador, who will always be on the &s;pot. If it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to divide it a little, in order to extend his influence, he will not be at a lo&s;s for friends. Some of our &s;enators may think it an honor, and perhaps a duty, to hold part of the royal &s;tock in their own name, and to repre&s;ent and obey the real owner in all matters which relate to their re&s;pective in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The&s;e ten articles are to be permanent. We might, there|fore, rea&s;onably hope, that in &s;ome of them, at lea&s;t, could be found an advantage to the United States. But we &s;earch for it in vain. The more we examine the in&s;trument, the greater is our &s;urpri&s;e and concern, that our intere&s;ts have been &s;o little
<PB N="132" REF="028389_0419_0FD8EB5F331B05E8">attended to, and that Great Britain has given us no one thing in return for conce&s;&s;ions which are important to her, and will &s;ooner or later be &s;everely felt and reprobated by America.</P>
<P>One palpable omi&s;&s;ion is di&s;coverable in the perpetual part of this contract. It has occurred to every one, and re&s;pects the com|pen&s;ation which was due to our citizens for the negroes which were carried away, at the peace; as by the &s;eventh article of the treaty of peace, his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;tipulates, that be would with all convenient &s;peed and without cau&s;ing any de&s;truction or carrying away any negroes or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies from the United States. Notice was received by Sir Guy Carleton of this treaty in the beginning of April, 1783, after which no negroes &s;hould have been carried away&mdash;Yet, as early as the &s;ixth of May, a <HI>large</HI> number had been already embarked for Nova Scotia, of which General Wa&s;hington complained, as a violation of the treaty&mdash; In Sir Guy Carleton's an&s;wer, dated 12th May, 1783, he ad|mits the fact, but &s;uppo&s;es he had no right to deprive them of their liberty. He mentions, however, that he had pre&s;erved an accurate regi&s;ter, by which the name of the proprietor, and the value of the negro, might be a&s;certained, in order that an adju&s;tment might take place by compen&s;ation, if it really was the intention of the treaty, that they &s;hould be re&s;tored. Under this pretext, Sir Guy embarked, between the months of April and that of November, when the evacuation took place, three thou&s;and negroes, who were in&s;pected by our commi&s;&s;ioners, and a very large number more, in public and private ve&s;&s;els, of whom they were not permitted to take in&s;pection.&mdash;"Here then," &s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on, "was a <HI>direct, unequivocal,</HI> and <HI>avowed</HI> violation of this part of the &s;eventh article, in the fir&s;t moments of its being known&mdash;An article which had been of <HI>extreme &s;olicitude</HI> on our part, and on the fulfilment of which depended the means of paying debts, in proportion to the num|ber of labourers withdrawn; and when, in the very act of violation, we warn and put the commanding officer on his guard, he &s;ays directly, he will go through with the act, and leave it to his court to <HI>adju&s;t it by compen&s;ation.</HI>" Yet this com|pen&s;ation, after being delayed twelve years, is formally aban|doned, in a manner as <HI>direct, unequivocal,</HI> and <HI>avowed,</HI> as that in which the infraction was committed, and that, too, in a moment when all America believed Mr. Jay was &s;ent to demand ju&s;tice for this, among other grievances&mdash;Our only con&s;olation for this palpable &s;acrifice, is the reflection, that if compen&s;ation for the negroes had been granted, &s;ome very extravagant con&s;i|deration would have been exacted by Great Britain, and, in all
<PB N="133" REF="028389_0420_0FD8EB608FAD6D80">probability, obtained, con&s;idering the complai&s;ant mood in which the negociation appears to have been conducted on our part. Perhaps, then, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is owing to this omi&s;&s;ion, that the treaty wants one other exceptionable article. I &s;hall only add here, that the negroes carried away, regi&s;tered and unregi&s;ter|ed, could not have amounted to le&s;s than <HI>five thou&s;and,</HI> who, at two hundred and fifty dollars a man, were worth <HI>one million, two hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars;</HI> a &s;um more than &s;uffi|cient to pay all the old Briti&s;h debts, due from American citizens.</P>
<P>The eleventh article &s;tipulates, that there &s;hall be, between the two countries, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of naviga|tion and commerce, under certain limitations and conditions, expre&s;&s;ed in the articles which follow.</P>
<P>We are happy, at length, to arrive at an article, which pro|mi&s;es &s;omething like reciprocity and perfect equality. We hope our envoy will not again lo&s;e &s;ight of the&s;e corner &s;tones of a treaty, and that Great Britain, tired or a&s;hamed of obtaining every thing &s;he has yet a&s;ked, will manife&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition &s;ome|what more liberal than has yet appeared. The reader will judge whether this has been the ca&s;e. His expectations, however, mu&s;t not be too &s;anguine, or his di&s;appointment may be &s;till greater than mine was.</P>

<P>AS even a majority of the &s;enate, who do not appear to have been very difficult to plea&s;e, have di&s;approved of this article, few partizans of the treaty can be found hardy enough to advocate it. The doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, which is again becoming &s;o fa&s;hionable, ought to teach them the propriety of being &s;ilent; for how can the &s;enate do wrong? But, notwith&s;tanding the negative of the &s;enate, and exceptionable as it is in every part, &s;ome few there are, who have repre&s;ented it as a va&s;t acqui&s;ition to this coun|try, and expre&s;s great regret at the <HI>&s;tipulated &s;u&s;pen&s;ion.</HI> Some indeed &s;ay, that the advocates of this de&s;cription neither re|ceived their birth, education, or attachments, in this country.

Not even an <HI>Albany &s;toop</HI> will be permitted to vi&s;it tho&s;e i&s;lands. This article will not only con|fine to Briti&s;h bottoms the trade between the&s;e &s;tates and the We&s;t Indies, but, as if it was a real advantage to America, we have &s;tipulated not to export, to any part of the world, even our own cotton, nor any mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee, or cocoa. But as this article was not ratified, owing to the firmne&s;s of one of the majority, a &s;enator from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, it cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to pay it a very minute attention. We cannot, however, &s;uppre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment, that an American amba&s;|&s;ador &s;hould have &s;et his &s;ignature to an article &s;o pernicious and di&s;graceful to America. We become almo&s;t willing to pardon the member from Bo&s;ton, for &s;upporting the other ar|ticles, ruinous and unequal as they are, for his &s;teady oppo&s;i|tion to this one. While we are upon the We&s;t India trade, it cannot be impertinent to contra&s;t the conduct of the French republic with that of Great Britain. On the 19th of February, 1793, the national convention decreed:

<P>By this article, our commerce with the Briti&s;h "territories in the Ea&s;t Indies," is regulated.

<P>"Our ve&s;&s;els are to pay in the &s;aid ports no higher tonnage duty than is paid for Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in our ports, nor are we to pay higher duties or charges, on the importation or expor|tation of merchandi&s;e, than is paid on the &s;ame articles, when imported or exported in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els; but it is expre&s;sly agreed, that the ve&s;&s;els of the United States &s;hall not carry any of the <HI>articles exported by them from the &s;aid Briti&s;h territories,</HI> to any port or place, except to &s;ome port or place in America, <HI>where the &s;ame &s;hall be unladen.</HI> Nor are our ve&s;&s;els to carry on any part of the coa&s;ting trade of the &s;aid Briti&s;h territor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

<P>This being the article, about which the friends of the trea|ty have exulted mo&s;t, it was thought proper to give it pretty well at length. It has been a&s;&s;erted, that, by it, important commercial rights are &s;ecured to our citizens, in their navi|gation and trade with the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies. To form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the&s;e advantages, attention mu&s;t be had to the commerce of the contracting parties, at the time of forming the treaty. If it is placed on a better footing, we have gained,
<PB N="136" REF="028389_0423_0FD8EB651A819560">provided we have not paid too great a price. But if our com|merce in the Ea&s;t Indies is re&s;trained by this article, it will be &s;omewhat difficult to point out any advantage we have acquired by it. The merchants, who are certainly the mo&s;t competent judges in the&s;e matters, contend, that the trade of the United States to the Ea&s;t Indies, is placed on a much wor&s;e footing than before. They a&s;&s;ign, among others, the following rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, That American ve&s;&s;els carry a &s;mall proportion of &s;alted provi&s;ions to Bombay, where they take in cotton and &s;harks fins on freight to China, which was &s;o con&s;iderable, as to ena|ble them to lay in a return cargo to great advantage. A &s;hip of five hundred tons would clear thirty thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The American &s;hips going to Bengal, frequently found very advantageous freights to &s;ome free port in Europe. The cu&s;tomary freight was from ten to fifteen pounds &s;terling a ton. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that nine-tenths of our trade to the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies was carried on in this way.</P>
<P N="3">3d, The direct trade of Bengal and Bombay was trifling until the &s;ugar plantations in the We&s;t Indies were de&s;troyed. We then imported &s;ugar from the Ea&s;t Indies to advantage; but on the re&s;toration of peace. this trade cannot be pur&s;ued but to a di&s;advantage&mdash;the voyage being too long, the &s;ugar not &s;o &s;trong as that of the We&s;t Indies, and the &s;upplies from the i&s;lands being &s;ufficient for any u&s;e we can make of them, the former not an&s;wering to refine. Saltpetre is an article which we may import to advantage: in peace we want but little of it, and in war it is prohibited.</P>

<P>COTTON is low in the Ea&s;t Indies, but not of a good quality. It will not an&s;wer for importing, while we can have that of the We&s;t Indies and our own, the &s;taple being too &s;hort for water &s;pinning. White goods, with &s;ome gold and &s;ilver mu&s;lins, may be imported from Bombay and Calcutta, and &s;ome printed mu&s;lins from Madras; but the con&s;umption of this country would not require three cargoes in a year, un|le&s;s we printed them. The French u&s;e many; but they import them to print, and vend them in Europe and the We&s;t Indies. Almo&s;t all <HI>white goods</HI> may be had on the Hoogley, ju&s;t above Calcutta, at a place called Be&s;unpoor, a Dani&s;h port, on lower terms than at Calcutta, al&s;o at Chandanagore, a French port,
<PB N="137" REF="028389_0424_0FD8EB694A361320">at the mouth of the Ganges. From the I&s;le of France we im|port coffee and indigo; they rai&s;e cotton, which, for the rea|&s;ons above mentioned, is &s;eldom imported, and becau&s;e it an&s;wers better in China. Coffee an&s;wers well, as the price is lower and the quality better, than that from the We&s;t Indies. We export to that place, &s;alted provi&s;ions, and &s;ome naval &s;tores; and our ve&s;&s;els are frequently employed in carrying &s;laves and cattle, from Madaga&s;car and the Main, for the u&s;e of that colony.</P>
<P>From this cur&s;ory view of our commerce with the Ea&s;t In|dies, it appears, that were we excluded altogether from the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, we could obtain the &s;ame articles upon as ea&s;y or better terms, at other ports. This mu&s;t be the rea&s;on, why Great Britain has &s;o long permitted the trade in que&s;tion; or perhaps a better one is, &s;ome immediate benefit &s;he derives from it; for it will not be contended, that a nation who has done us no one act of kindne&s;s, during twelve years of peace, has been influenced in this part of her conduct, by affection for us, or any other worthy motive. Notwith&s;tanding, then, that this trade has heretofore been carried on, by the mere permi&s;|&s;ion of the Briti&s;h government, it was no more precarious, or likely to be interrupted or &s;topped, than the trade we carried on with her European ports. As well might it be &s;aid, that Great Britain had hitherto <HI>merely permitted</HI> us to export her manufactures, and to run in debt every year to her merchants, and as this right may be re&s;trained or prohibited whenever &s;he plea&s;es, it is a great acqui&s;ition to have &s;ecured it, in &s;uch way as to be liable to no interruption. If, then, it be true, that we enjoyed the Ea&s;t India trade in as great a latitude before, as at pre&s;ent, with the addition of the coa&s;ting trade of that country, which principally rendered it worth pur&s;uing, why relinqui&s;h the latter, without acquiring any exten&s;ion of the former? for as to its permanency, it has already been &s;hown, that it was as much &s;o, as the intere&s;t of Great Britain could render it. Nay, why not only give up the carrying trade; but &s;tipulate expre&s;sly, that we will carry to no part of the world, except to the United States, the Ea&s;t India goods we export from the Briti&s;h &s;ettle|ments. I know it has been &s;aid, that we are not re&s;trained by this article, from exporting from the United States, the goods we bring from tho&s;e factories in the ha&s;t Indies. It is much to be regretted, that in an in&s;trument of this kind, any room &s;hould be left for con&s;truction or for doubt, as to the true mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">g and intention of the parties. This is too frequently the ca&s;e with this treaty, which, con&s;idering the power with which it is made, &s;hould have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y preci&s;e, and free from every doubtful and equiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">al expre&s;&s;ion. We know
<PB N="138" REF="028389_0425_0FD8EB6B0B01AC38">too well, that if con&s;truction is re&s;orted to, Great Britain, be|ing the more powerful nation, will be able to put her own upon it; and we have too much rea&s;on to fear, from what has alrea|dy happened, that even tho&s;e who now contend for a contrary con&s;truction, will be complai&s;ant enough, to accede to the one adopted by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try. For we have men among us, and they are called <HI>patriots,</HI> who have ju&s;tified that nation for her repeated violation of faith to this country, and particularly for her non-ob&s;ervance of the treaty of peace, although Mr. Jeffer&s;on, not by rea&s;oning alone, but by facts, has proved that &s;he was not to be ju&s;tified in a &s;ingle in&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is from this conduct of &s;ome of our citizens in office, that Great Britain has been encouraged to per&s;evere in her faithle&s;s &s;y&s;tem towards us, and to demand from us &s;tipulations which an unfortunate war of ten years ought never to have extorted from us. It was a circum&s;tance of additional misfortune to the United States, that the late envoy, for rea&s;ons which will never perhaps be developed, was among the foremo&s;t in ju&s;tifying the conduct of Great Britain. From his efforts, therefore, it was impo&s;&s;ible for Americans to expect favorable terms. I acquit him, however, and that mo&s;t &s;incerely, of any bribery or cor|ruption, in this negociation, &s;o &s;trongly charged upon him by many. I rather believe, that he has been <HI>cajoled</HI> into the mea|&s;ure&mdash;and that from a belief that <HI>any treaty whatever,</HI> with Great Britain, would be plea&s;ing to a certain party among us. Rather, therefore, than di&s;appoint the expectations of tho&s;e people, he has affixed his &s;eal to an in&s;trument, which mu&s;t meet the marked di&s;approbation of every man in America, ex|cept &s;uch only as form the Briti&s;h faction, from whom alone, the United States have to apprehend any kind of danger to their con&s;titution and liberties. This di&s;&s;atisfaction manife&s;ted it&s;elf in a mo&s;t emphatical manner, on the late anniver&s;ary of our independence. Even on that au&s;picious day, when it is u&s;ual to bury per&s;onal animo&s;ity, and to check the effu&s;ions and gall of party &s;pirit, how unanimou&s;ly have different &s;ocieties and companies, without any previous concert, not only in this city, but in other parts of the &s;tate and union, expre&s;&s;ed their ab|horrence of the mea&s;ure! Toa&s;ts, &s;ignificant of their di&s;plea|&s;ure, have already appeared from every part; and among the variety which that day gave birth to, is one to be found, which di&s;covers even a partial approbation of the treaty?

Alarmed at an oppo&s;ition &s;o &s;ormidable, and con&s;cious, that the mea&s;ure cannot be defended, tho&s;e who feed a peculiar intere&s;t in forcing it upon us, begin to re&s;ort to their old cry of anti-federali&s;m. A calm ob&s;erver, in the Daily Adverti&s;er of the 11th, remarks, that "a <HI>few weak-minded</HI> per&s;ons have been imperceptibly led a&s;tray, and almo&s;t &s;acrificed their prin|ciples on the altar of faction and di&s;appointment, under the garb of republicani&s;m; they have wi&s;ely cho&s;en the late treaty for their rallying point, and over the back of this hobby hor&s;e, aimed a <HI>deadly blow</HI> at the con&s;titution."&mdash;In&s;tead of an&s;wering the numerous objections which are daily made to the treaty, this writer aims an undi&s;tingui&s;hed con&s;ure again&s;t all who op|po&s;e it. All tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee what tho&s;e champions have not yet di&s;covered them&s;elves, that the treaty is an eligible one for this country, are, for&s;ooth, <HI>weak-minded,</HI> or anti-federali&s;ts. &mdash;It is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover any connection between the fate of this treaty and the con&s;titution. The true friends of the con&s;ti|tution may be oppo&s;ed to the treaty, as, on the other hand, its enemies may advocate it: whether this be really the ca&s;e, is left to the people, if they be not too <HI>weak-minded,</HI> to deter|mine. Be not deceived, fellow citizens; tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the treaty, are as firm friends to the con&s;titution as any among you; they know its excellencies, and are not afraid to &s;peak of its de|fects, as time and operation di&s;cover them; for what human work is perfect? They wi&s;h not only that it may be maintained, but that it may be defended from the encroachments of a &s;et of men, who, while accu&s;ing you of a de&s;ire of overthrowing the government, are de&s;troying the fir&s;t principles of our a&s;&s;o|ciation, and by con&s;tructions, u&s;urpation, and otherwi&s;e, are either a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves or granting to others, powers and authorities not warranted by the con&s;titution. Is there a man among us who has ever advi&s;ed you to oppo&s;e any mea&s;ure of government? Do we di&s;pute the right of the &s;enate and pre&s;i|dent to make treaties? No; but we in&s;i&s;t upon the right (and it was the exerci&s;e of this right which &s;ecured our freedom and independence) of giving our &s;entiments upon any act which it is propo&s;ed to make the rule of our conduct and the &s;upreme law of the land; we claim the privilege of petitioning and remon&s;trating again&s;t a mea&s;ure, which ignominiou&s;ly &s;acrifices to our fir&s;t and greate&s;t enemy, our ju&s;t demands, and mu&s;t, in time, pro&s;trate at her feet, our very &s;overeignty and indepen|dence. We think we are not to blame for expo&s;ing to view the &s;ecret machinations of one branch of the legi&s;lature to form a di&s;graceful connection with any nation. In &s;ine, we claim the right of thinking for our&s;elve, uninfluenced by <HI>office</HI> or other
<PB N="140" REF="028389_0427_0FD8EB72C97C92D8">unworthy con&s;iderations, and we thank God, that the unbia&s;&s;ed voice of America, as far as it has been heard, from the &s;everal &s;tates where our di&s;grace has been publi&s;hed, is on our &s;ide. &mdash;We rejoice at this circum&s;tance, becau&s;e &s;uch united and unconcerted marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, we yet hope, may induce the pre&s;ident to &s;u&s;pend his &s;anction, and thereby give him&s;elf a new title to the endearing appellation of the father of his country.</P>
<P>But it is time to return to the 13th article&mdash;we left it in doubt, whether Americans could carry to Europe, or el&s;where (except to their own country) the articles they export from the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies; for, if they cannot, it is conceded, that &s;uch a re&s;triction, together with a formal dereliction of the coa&s;ting trade, were con&s;iderations too valuable and di&s;propor|tioned for the permi&s;&s;ion given us in the former part of the article. I &s;ay, we cannot, and that, confu&s;ed as the phra&s;eo|logy is, it will admit of no other rea&s;onable con&s;truction. "It is expre&s;sly agreed (the&s;e are the words of the treaty) that the ve&s;&s;els of the United States &s;hall not carry any <HI>of the articles exported by them from the &s;aid Briti&s;h territories</HI> (or, in other words, any <HI>Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India articles</HI>) to any port or place, ex|cept to &s;ome port or place in America, <HI>where the &s;ame &s;hall be unladen.</HI>" If, then, the articles have been exported by us, from the Briti&s;h territories in the Ea&s;t Indies, under which clau&s;e is it, that we claim a right to carry them to Europe, or el&s;e|where? If &s;uch privilege was intended, why oblige us to <HI>unlade</HI> them in the United States? or why not, in expre&s;s terms, &s;e|cure the permi&s;&s;ion? Hence it follows, that this article, in|&s;tead of extending our commerce, may be regarded among the mo&s;t obnoxious of the treaty; and I am well informed, that our merchants, who are immediately concerned in the Ea&s;t India trade, view it in that light: Briti&s;h factories will &s;oon be e&s;tabli&s;hed in our principal &s;ea-ports; and, in a few years, the whole of this trade mu&s;t fall into their hands. Well might Mr. Pitt boa&s;t, on the floor of the hou&s;e of commons, that he was not a&s;hamed of his treaty with this country; his &s;till in finance has been long admitted; his abilities, as a nego|ciator, ought never hereafter to be called in que&s;tion.</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE BOSTON CHRONICLE. Strictures on the late Conduct of the Executive.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Pre&s;ident of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that no mea&s;ure of the Briti&s;h, &s;ince you was engaged in politics, has been more generally reprobated by the people of <HI>America,</HI> than the late treaty; which, not only as it re&s;pects <HI>the eventual &s;urrender of this country into the hands of our inveterate enemies, the Briti&s;h,</HI> but even <HI>the &s;ecret mode of conducting this bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> has naturally led the citizens to view it with a peculiar jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The apparent objects of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion, are &s;o oppo&s;ite to what he has accompli&s;hed in his treaty, that it was not con|ceived po&s;&s;ible that you would ju&s;tify his conduct. The ob|jects of it we have under your own communications. It is therein declared, that you meant to give <HI>"&s;olemnity"</HI> to his mi&s;&s;ion. You arre&s;ted the proceedings of congre&s;s on this explicit decla|ration, that you intended to vindicate the rights of the people, and expre&s;s their <HI>"feelings."</HI> The <HI>confidence</HI> placed in you, reconciled even the advocates for other mea&s;ures, to the <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> of your &s;olemn appeal to the Briti&s;h court. This is &s;o evident to have been the voice of your con&s;tituents, <HI>at the time Mr. Jay was appointed,</HI> that even the tories &s;u&s;pected that &s;omething intere&s;ting would take place in vindication of our national ho|nor; and that you would feel your&s;elf <HI>bound</HI> to &s;upport your proclamation, agreeably to the <HI>modern</HI> law of nations. But, &s;trange to &s;ay, your amba&s;&s;ador has de&s;troyed the very ground upon which your proclamation was founded, and has made a treaty in direct violation of it. <HI>You</HI> mentioned the <HI>modern</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, on the contrary <HI>he</HI> has expre&s;sly declared the rever&s;e. <HI>You</HI> was &s;o particular on this point, as to <HI>italici&s;e</HI> the term <HI>"modern;"</HI> but in oppo&s;ition to this declaration, <HI>he</HI> has con&s;ented to the <HI>ancient</HI> law of nations, which is, no more, nor le&s;s, than the <HI>particular law of Britain.</HI></P>
<P>When your proclamation was fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued, &s;everal towns met to approbate it; and even many of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are now addre&s;&s;ing you in behalf of the treaty (who&s;e political principles, by the way, have, in no in&s;tance, been remarkably friendly to the rights of the people) were in favor of the proclamation.&mdash;
<PB N="142" REF="028389_0429_0FD8EB75D4509B78">But, as if &s;ome &s;trange fatality attended the affairs of <HI>America,</HI> tho&s;e very per&s;ons are for relinqui&s;hing the &s;pirit of your pro|clamation, which they were &s;o anxious to &s;upport, and are now urging you, contrary to the &s;entiments of ninety-nine hun|dredths of their fellow citizens, to ratify a <HI>treaty</HI> which de&s;troys the very e&s;&s;ence of it.</P>
<P>Wherein, &s;ir, has Mr. Jay been &s;ucce&s;sful in his negociation, that <HI>you</HI> or <HI>they</HI> can approbate his conduct? You was either <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> in your <HI>proclamation,</HI> or Mr. Jay mu&s;t be guilty of act|ing contrary to his in&s;tructions. But the latter does not appear, and yet it is &s;aid, that you have ratified his treaty, while nothing is handed to the public to convince them that you was <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> in vindicating their neutrality upon the "<HI>modern</HI> law" of nations. This, at lea&s;t, we ought to be gratified with; for notwith&s;tand|ing the confidence placed in you, we are left in a di&s;agreeable dilemma; for if we ju&s;tify the <HI>treaty,</HI> we mu&s;t condemn your proclamation; or if we are in &s;avor of the proclamation, we mu&s;t reprobate the treaty.</P>
<P>We reque&s;t of you then, &s;ir, to let us know the rea&s;ons, why you cannot vindicate your <HI>primary conduct,</HI> before we are obliged to accede to the propriety of Mr. Jay's negociation. If you was precipitate in your proclamation, by guaranteeing to the United States, their neutrality, on the "<HI>modern law</HI> of nations"&mdash;if you was equally ha&s;ty in declaring that Mr. Jay was &s;ent to vindicate, with firmne&s;s, the rights of the United States&mdash;if the&s;e things were done without <HI>mature deliberation,</HI> and you are now obliged to <HI>retreat,</HI> "We, the people," as friends to <HI>you,</HI> and to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> would thank you to let them know the rea&s;ons, why you have altered your &s;entiments?</P>
<P>In politics, as in religion, we ought to be furni&s;hed with &s;ome arguments of the "hope that is within us;" but as the treaty bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tands at pre&s;ent, your friends are puzzled to vindicate your conduct again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of that cla&s;s of citizens, who rea&s;on from no other &s;ource than what they conceive to be the welfare of their country.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that Mr. Jay was &s;ent on his emba&s;&s;y to England, to vindicate our rights, Mr. Monroe was &s;ent to France, with an explicit declaration, to draw <HI>clo&s;er the bonds of alliance between the two republics.</HI> In this in&s;tance, the people were plea&s;ed. Mr. Jay went to <HI>demand indemnification</HI> on the principles of our being a neutral nation, agreeable to the "mo|dern law;" while Mr. Monroe was &s;ent to form a more intimate alliance with France. A benediction accompanied your com|mi&s;&s;ion on this occa&s;ion, that "God would take the republic under his holy keeping." But it &s;eems, that while the French
<PB N="143" REF="028389_0430_0FD8EB770BFEB590">were willing to enter into the mo&s;t beneficial commercial alli|ance with America, they were di&s;regarded, when at the &s;ame time Mr. Jay was hurrying on his bu&s;ine&s;s, under all the ad|vantages of his mo&s;t gracious maje&s;ty's levees, and the enter|tainments of Pitt, and his condjutors.&mdash;And &s;till further, when he arrived in America, be is clo&s;eted under all the injunctions of profound &s;ecrecy, and the deci&s;ions of the &s;enate are urged to be ratified "without delay," with only the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of one article.</P>
<P>What, &s;ir, are the people to think on this procedure; or what are the French to conjecture? Mu&s;t not the <HI>latter</HI> &s;up|po&s;e, that there is an earne&s;t de&s;ire to link this country in a treaty with England, rather than with them? You cannot, &s;ir, &s;uppo&s;e that the French are &s;o blind, as not to notice this appa|rent partiality; and provided they &s;hould re&s;ent it, or con&s;ider it as an in&s;idious piece of conduct on our part, it would be a &s;erious que&s;tion among the citizens, to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t part of the govern|ment,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to that nation which helped us when we required their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;ir, are important con&s;iderations. They require a &s;erious deliberation before they are rejected. The Americans feel an attachment to France, and they cannot be ea&s;ily turned a&s;ide from wi&s;hing them &s;ucce&s;s. They have every rea&s;on to re&s;pect the French, and they have as cogent rea&s;ons to repro|bate the Engli&s;h. We e&s;teem you, &s;ir, for what you have done, in company with the American army, and the French navy and &s;oldiers; but you may excu&s;e the citizens of America, if they &s;till retain an affection for their allies, and are unwilling, through the in&s;trumentality of any man or body of men, to come again under the controul of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>We fought to obtain our rights, and we tru&s;t in heaven that we &s;hall be able to hand them down to our po&s;terity. It is of but little con&s;equence by whom we are &s;acrificed, whether by Lord North or Judge Jay.</P>
<P>On this que&s;tion, we mean to re&s;pect you; but the liberties of America have been purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate to be lo&s;t with|out <HI>a &s;trugyle</HI> for their maintenance.</P>

<HEAD>STRICTURES On the Pre&s;ident's Circular An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>The two branches ought not to &s;ub&s;titute for their own conviction, the opinions of others.&mdash;</P>
<BIBL><HI>Pre&s;ident's circular an&s;wer.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I BELIEVE there never was a bolder ab&s;urdity publi&s;hed, than, that in a repre&s;entative government, the repre&s;enta|tive body is not bound by the opinion of the body con&s;tituent: for if it be true, that the repre&s;entative body be not thus bound, repre&s;entation is neither tru&s;t nor agency, but another name for the wor&s;t &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m, where the will of the many is controuled by the opinion of the few. It is true, that many &s;pecious &s;ophi&s;ms have been invented within the&s;e few years, to quibble away the &s;overeignty of the people of the United States: but my con&s;cience impels me to believe, that the man who cheats his fellow citizens out of their liberties, by fal&s;e logic, is a more dete&s;table character, than he, who, with a fal&s;e key, opens the doors of his neighbour's hou&s;e, rifles him of his &s;ub&s;tance, ina&s;much, as liberty is more precious than wealth.</P>
<P>The only writer I know of, who has written expre&s;sly on this &s;ubject, is Noah Web&s;ter, junior, E&s;quire, attorney at law. This gentleman &s;ays, in his fourth chapter on governments, "That the people ought not to give binding in&s;tructions to repre&s;entatives. That the right of election is the only con&s;titu|tional right which they can, with propriety, exerci&s;e." The&s;e po&s;itions, he &s;ays, convey the &s;ame idea; and, if true, they contravene, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a fundamental maxim of Ame|rican politics, which is, that the &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the people. Mo&s;t unque&s;tionably, if the&s;e po&s;itions are true, then is the maxim fal&s;e. But, &s;ays this gentleman, "I am not de&s;ir|ous of &s;ubverting this favorite maxim: but I am very de&s;irous it &s;hould be properly qualified. The people have a right to ad|vi&s;e their repre&s;entatives in certain ca&s;es, in which they may be well informed: but this right cannot often be exerci&s;ed with propriety or &s;afety; nor &s;hould their in&s;tructions be binding or their repre&s;entatives." Here is a right which cannot often be exerci&s;ed with propriety or &s;afety, and, when exerci&s;ed, is not binding: a right, qualified by the logical dexterity of a lawyer, to be no right at all: a camelion kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, which, like the con&s;ciences of &s;ome folks, a&s;&s;umes all &s;hapes, but the &s;hape of
<PB N="148" REF="028389_0435_0FD8EB898D32FF70">con&s;i&s;tency and of truth. But what is the rea&s;on that this is a right and no right&mdash;that it is to be exerci&s;ed and not exerci&s;ed &mdash;that it is a right, and not binding&mdash;and, like Mr. Dexter's republicani&s;m, means any thing or nothing? Why, for&s;ooth, "becau&s;e <HI>people live remote from each other,</HI> and cannot always be acquainted with the general intere&s;t of the &s;tate; they can|not know all the rea&s;ons which may be offered for or again&s;t a mea&s;ure, by people in di&s;tant parts of the &s;tate: they cannot tell at home, how they them&s;elves would think and act in a general a&s;&s;embly of all the citizens." So that becau&s;e every man is not omni&s;cient and omnipre&s;ent, the people are to be deprived of all controul over their own repre&s;entatives. Accord|ing to this doctrine, legitimate human government never can exi&s;t. Let us con&s;ider the tendency of the&s;e arguments. It is admitted, that, where the whole &s;ociety can convene, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of repre&s;entation. But, according to Mr. Web&s;ter's arguments, a &s;ociety could avail it&s;elf of no benefit or purpo&s;e, by actual convention of the whole; every individual being ex|cluded, by his doctrine, of the right to vote; for as he cannot know the intere&s;ts of the whole, therefore, he cannot decide upon any que&s;tion in which tho&s;e intere&s;ts are involved. This doctrine of Web&s;ter's is very &s;imilar to Black&s;tone's doctrine of the community of goods. The earth and all things thereon, &s;ays Black&s;tone, was given by the creator to man, in common; but as it was given to man in common, no man could exerci&s;e private or particular dominion over any part of that which was given in common, without violating the community of goods; &s;ince the property belonged equally to all. But as it is plain &s;uch a community of goods in practice, would be a mere nul|lity; &s;o is Mr. Web&s;ter's community of intere&s;ts. A whole &s;ociety meet in convention, to decide upon the intere&s;ts of the whole: but this deci&s;ion is impo&s;&s;ible to be effected, according to Mr. Web&s;ter's doctrine; for the individuals, or the parts of the &s;ociety, cannot vote; becau&s;e they are not the whole; but the whole includes all the parts; therefore, the whole cannot vote, becau&s;e the parts cannot; therefore, neither the parts nor the whole can vote; therefore, the whole is a mere nullity.</P>
<P>We are every day told, that a repre&s;entative is not only to repre&s;ent the per&s;ons who elected him, but he is to repre&s;ent the whole &s;tate; and, therefore, he cannot be bound by the opinion of his electors. If the fallacy of this argument be not already &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed, we might deny that it can apply to the United States; as it contains the po&s;ition of univer&s;al re|pre&s;entation, which can only be bottomed upon univer&s;al elec|tion, a thing not known in the&s;e &s;tates.</P>

What &s;ort of a repre&s;entative would a per&s;on cho&s;en in the di&s;trict of Maine, or the territory north we&s;t of the Ohio, make for the people of South Carolina or Georgia? It is evi|dent at fir&s;t blu&s;h, that &s;uch a repre&s;entative might know no more of the intere&s;ts of his pretended &s;outhern con&s;tituents, than the man in the moon; and if a knowledge of the intere&s;ts of the whole, be e&s;&s;ential to enable a part of the people to give, with propriety, binding in&s;tructions to their repre&s;enta|tives, &s;urely a little knowledge is nece&s;&s;ary, to con&s;titute a man a repre&s;entative of the whole; and how is the inhabitant of the di&s;trict of Maine, to di&s;cover a knowledge of the intere&s;ts of the people of Georgia? It may be an&s;wered, through the me|dium of the repre&s;entatives of the people of Georgia. But may not the repre&s;entatives of Georgia, deceive the inhabitant of the di&s;trict of Maine on this &s;ubject? and is it not ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree, to &s;ay that a repre&s;entative ought to de&s;ert the intere&s;ts of his own electors, with which he is well acquainted, in order to guard the intere&s;ts of a people foreign to him; who are repre&s;ented by expre&s;s delegations from them&s;elves; and of whom all his knowledge mu&s;t be taken upon the tru&s;t of other people? Such arguments, of univer&s;al repre&s;entation, cannot apply to the United States; becau&s;e the local divi&s;ions of &s;tates &s;till exi&s;t, and the repre&s;entation is founded upon local and not general principles. If, indeed, the repre&s;entatives were elected out of the whole union, they would be general, and not local repre&s;entatives; but even then, the principle, that the repre|&s;entative body is bound by the will of the body con&s;tituent, will hold good: as this principle is commen&s;urate with every po&s;&s;ible degree of repre&s;entation. If the repre&s;entative is local, he may be re&s;trained by local in&s;tructions. If he is general, or continental, he may be re&s;trained by general, or continental in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid that a man ought not to be &s;ettered with in&s;truc|tions, but &s;hould be &s;uffered to go independent to congre&s;s. I can form to my&s;elf the idea of the animal, repre&s;ented by Horace, that had the body of an hor&s;e, the head of a man, and the wings of a bird, but a tru&s;tee independent of his tru&s;|ter, an agent independent of his principal, or a repre&s;entative independent of his con&s;tituent, is a thing that I cannot con|ceive; and to &s;ay that a repre&s;entative ought to go to congre&s;s unfettered with in&s;tructions, is very much like &s;aying he ought to go to congre&s;s, not to repre&s;ent his con&s;tituent, but to repre|&s;ent him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of logic, that in a free country a repre&s;entative is bound to repre&s;ent him&s;elf, prevailed to &s;uch a degree, about
<PB N="150" REF="028389_0437_0FD8EB8C2580EBF0">the time that the federal government was formed, that a per|&s;on cho&s;en to repre&s;ent Sandwich, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in conven|tion, refu&s;ed to be fettered, as he called it, and re&s;igned his appointment, becau&s;e his con&s;tituents in&s;tructed him to vote again&s;t the federal con&s;titution. Among the rea&s;ons urged by Mr. Bourne, the per&s;on in que&s;tion, for declining the &s;ervice of his fellow citizens, are the following: "Under the re&s;trictions with which your delegates are fettered, the greate&s;t ideot may an&s;wer your purpo&s;e, as well as the greate&s;t man. The &s;uffrages of our fellow men, when they neither repo&s;e confidence in our integrity, nor pay a tribute of re&s;pect to our abilities, can ne|ver be agreeable." I am not di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion the &s;incerity of Mr. Bourne, on this occa&s;ion. His conclu&s;ions are, however, totally fal&s;e; for it does not follow, becau&s;e a repre&s;enta|tive is bound to expre&s;s the will of his con&s;tituents, that, there|fore, the greate&s;t ideot will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well as the greate&s;t man. Generals of armies, and admirals of navies, are almo&s;t always bound by in&s;tructions, and yet it never entered any man's head, that an ideot was a proper per&s;on to command an ar|my or a fleet; and if &s;uch commander breaks his orders, he is &s;ure to get broke him&s;elf; and the maxim in commerce is, to break your owners rather than to break your orders. In &s;hort, what|ever Web&s;ter's or Bourne's notions of ideoti&s;m may be, it is evident, that the wi&s;e&s;t man will always di&s;charge the duties of a repre&s;entative be&s;t, however his in&s;tructions may be. The re&s;t of his arguments are equally &s;tupid: for the &s;uffrages of our fellow men are, in them&s;elves, the mo&s;t &s;acred depo&s;its of confidence in our integrity, and the mo&s;t tran&s;cendent tributes of re&s;pect to our abilities, which we can po&s;&s;ibly receive. And yet Mr. Web&s;ter tell us, that he would rather be the author of this &s;tupid addre&s;s, than all the laboured di&s;&s;ertations written upon the federal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If the repre&s;entatives from any di&s;trict are not bound by the opinions of &s;uch di&s;trict, but, on the contrary, are bound to con&s;ider the intere&s;t of the United States, generally, then it may be a&s;ked, with what propriety can the di&s;trict di&s;place the repre&s;entative, at the next election? and yet the di&s;tricts are ve&s;ted, by the con&s;titution, with this power. Here are repre|&s;entatives, bound to attend to the general intere&s;ts of the whole continent, and yet &s;ubject to be di&s;placed by the di&s;tricts, for &s;uch attention. It is evident, that the con&s;titution, by ap|portioning the repre&s;entation to particular &s;tates, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tended, that the particular intere&s;ts of each &s;tate &s;hould be &s;pecially attend|ed to, by the repre&s;entation flowing from it. And all argu|ments, controverting this evident principle, are more &s;ophi&s;try,
<PB N="151" REF="028389_0438_0FD8EB8CAD302168">calculated to deceive, and pave the way for hereditary repre|&s;entation, or a repre&s;entation for life. For, if the principle is once admitted, as con&s;titutional, that the repre&s;entatives from any &s;tate are bound to attend to the general intere&s;t of the United States, the intere&s;t of their own &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why congre&s;s may not de|clare them&s;elves hereditary legi&s;lators for the United States, <HI>ex|nece&s;&s;itate rei;</HI> becau&s;e, if they are bound to maintain the ge|neral welfare, they ought not to be controuled by partial inte|re&s;ts: and as the exerci&s;e of election manife&s;ts &s;uch controul, it ought to be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As this is a very important topic, I &s;hall follow Mr. Web|&s;ter a little. "The very doctrine of repre&s;entation in govern|ment, excludes the right of giving binding in&s;tructions to deputies. The de&s;ign of choo&s;ing repre&s;entatives, is, to collect the wi&s;dom of the &s;tate; the deputies are to unite their coun|cils; to meet and con&s;ult for the public &s;afety. But po&s;itive in|&s;tructions prevent this effect: they are dictated by local inte|re&s;ts, or opinions formed on an imperfect view of facts and arguments; in &s;hort, they totally counteract the good effects of public deliberations, and prevent tho&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures which may re&s;ult from united councils. They make the opini|ons of a &s;mall part of the &s;tate, the rule for the whole; they imply a deci&s;ion of a que&s;tion, before it is heard; they re|duce a repre&s;entative to a mere machine, by re&s;training the exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on; they &s;ubvert the very principles of repub|lican government. And, further, a repre&s;entative is bound by oath to act according to his judgment, and for the good of the people: his in&s;tructions forbid him to u&s;e his judgment; he mu&s;t then abandon either his orders, or his oath; perjury or di&s;obedience is his only alternative."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to all this, it may be &s;aid, that arguments, equally &s;pecious, may be urged again&s;t the con&s;i&s;tency of the attributes of the deity, the exerci&s;e of religion, the utility of virtue, or even again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of our exi&s;tence. But appearance is not reality, nor is &s;pecious &s;ophi&s;try, truth. If a man &s;ays two and two make five, and the half of five is three, I &s;ay, the man is either a fool or a knave; that he either is him&s;elf deceived, or &s;eeks to deceive others. So, when Mr. Web&s;ter tells us, that the doctrine of repre&s;entation excludes the right of giving binding in&s;tructions to deputies, he either does not under&s;tand the common acceptation of the word repre|&s;entation, or he means to play the &s;ophi&s;t. The meaning of the word repre&s;entation, is, bearing or exerci&s;ing the character or power of another; and if the doctrine of bearing or exerci&s;ing the
<PB N="152" REF="028389_0439_0FD8EB90241E9500">character or power of another, excludes the bearing or exer|ci&s;e of &s;uch character or power, then a thing is and is not; after which deduction, it would be folly in any man to rea&s;on with Mr. Web&s;ter, were not the public intere&s;ts involved in the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>But "The de&s;ign of choo&s;ing repre&s;entatives, is, to collect the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the &s;tate. This &s;tatement is not correct; it ought to be the <HI>will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the &s;tate; for, however the wi&s;dom of a &s;tate may be &s;uppered to be manife&s;ted, in the debates of a legi&s;lative body, yet the deci&s;ion is by vote, which is the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of will, and not of wi&s;dom; as many per&s;ons decide by vote, upon a que&s;tion, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which they have been totally &s;ilent. And it frequently happens, that a minority have all the wi&s;dom and truth on their &s;ide, but are obliged to &s;ubmit to the will of the majority.</P>
<P>Again, "The deputies are to unite their councils, to meet and con&s;ult for the public &s;afety; but in&s;tructions prevent this effect." I will be bold to a&s;&s;ert, that there never was on earth an union of councils, upon any great and intere&s;ting que&s;tion; and, until liberty is &s;wallowed up in de&s;poti&s;m, there never will be. The celebrated declaration of independence was car|ried by a majority of one only; the federal con&s;titution met with much oppo&s;ition, and the &s;enate of the United States was equally divided, upon every que&s;tion, for &s;everal weeks of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o that, to effect this fancied union of coun|cils, which is as little to be expected as a &s;imilarity in all our faces and di&s;po&s;itions, and which, if effected, would prove the mo&s;t intolerable of all tyrannies, the people of the United States are to be prevented from all controul over their re|pre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Again, "They make the opinions of a &s;mall part of the &s;tate, a rule for the whole." An a&s;&s;ertion of this kind could only have proceeded from a man, who, being educated in the habit of indi&s;criminately &s;upporting truth and fal&s;ehood, has lo&s;t all di&s;tinct perceptions of both, and is calculated to con|fute, not to convince. If the repre&s;entatives in congre&s;s, from any particular &s;tate, had the privilege of voting exclu&s;ively, and that &s;uch votes of one &s;tate &s;hould bind the whole, there might be &s;ome truth in this a&s;&s;ertion; but, when the whole repre&s;entatives, from all the &s;tates, vote on the &s;ame que&s;tion, it is as difficult to conceive how a part can rule the whole, as it is to conceive that a part is greater than the whole.</P>
<P>But, "a repre&s;entative has &s;worn to act according to his judgment; and his in&s;tructions forbid him to u&s;e his judgment; hence perjury or di&s;obedience is the alternative." Oaths have
<PB N="153" REF="028389_0440_0FD8EB9153191578">been thought nece&s;&s;ary, in courts of ju&s;tice, as obligations binding on the con&s;ciences of men, over which the court can exerci&s;e no other controul; but the exerci&s;e of office is another matter, and, I pre&s;ume, the controul, which a properly or|ganized body con&s;tituent has and pre&s;erves over its repre&s;enta|tives, &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of oaths altogether. But even if it did not, a man's judgment might, without any violation of his con&s;cience, dictate to him the impropriety of &s;etting up his own will, in oppo&s;ition to the will of his con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>It is the fate of &s;ophi&s;ts, to be eternally contradicting them|&s;elves; and this very gentleman, who has exhau&s;ted &s;o much rhetoric, to prove the impropriety of in&s;tructions to repre&s;en|tatives, after telling us, that the powers of a repre&s;entative &s;hould be wholly di&s;cretionary, when he acts as a legi&s;lator, &s;ays, "but, as an agent for a town or a &s;mall &s;ociety, he may have po&s;itive in&s;tructions. His con&s;tituents, in the la&s;t ca&s;e, are competent to in&s;truct him, becau&s;e they are the whole body concerned; but, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, they are but part of the &s;tate, and not competent to judge fully of the intere&s;ts of the whole." I would beg leave to a&s;k him, if a town is a whole &s;tate? it is not. How, then, can a town, according to Web|&s;ter's principles, give in&s;tructions? it cannot. But, after &s;pin|ning out forty pages of &s;ophi&s;try, he concedes all that is con|tended for, to wit, that towns may give binding in&s;tructions, becau&s;e they are the whole body concerned. But, in what &s;en&s;e, is a town the whole body concerned? in no other &s;en&s;e, but that the whole town is the whole body con&s;tituent; and no &s;en&s;ible man ever thought, that any part le&s;s than the whole, or a majority of the whole body con&s;tituent, could, of right, give binding in&s;tructions to the repre&s;entatives; but the whole body or a majority of the whole body con&s;tituent may; which, I believe, I have &s;ufficiently proved, and is conceded by Mr. Web&s;ter.</P>

What would be his &s;urpri&s;e, if, af|ter drawing this conclu&s;ion, he was informed, that the United States, except the war which emancipated them, have never been embroiled in any foreign quarrel? That, on the contrary, the ambition or inju&s;tice of Great Britain urges her to take part in almo&s;t every war which breaks out in Europe or A&s;ia; that America is nearly 3000 miles from the &s;cene of action, and the vortex of European politics; that &s;he is a peaceable, commercial nation; that her intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in ob&s;erving a &s;trict neutrality, <HI>not</HI> by withholding all &s;upplies from the belli|gerent powers, and &s;ullenly &s;hutting her ports again&s;t them all, but by an open, unre&s;erved, and equal communication and trade with all of them.

"It &s;hall be lawful," &s;ays this article, "for all and &s;ingular, the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, and the citizens, peo|ple and inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, to &s;ail with their &s;hips, with <HI>all manner of liberty, and &s;ecurity, no di&s;tinction being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de, who are the proprietors of the merchandizes laden thereon, from any port, to the places of tho&s;e who now are, or hereafter &s;hall be at enmity with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, or the United States.</HI> It &s;hall likewi&s;e be lawful for the &s;ubjects and inhabitants afore|&s;aid, to &s;ail with the &s;hips and merchandizes aforementioned; and to trade with the &s;ame liberty and &s;ecurity, from the places, ports, and havens of tho&s;e who are enemies of both, or either party, without any oppo&s;ition or di&s;turbance what&s;oever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned, to neutral places; but al&s;o from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy; whether they be un|der the juri&s;diction of the &s;ame prince, or &s;everal. And it is hereby &s;tipulated that <HI>free &s;hips</HI> &s;hall al&s;o give a <HI>freedom</HI> to <HI>goods;</HI> and that every thing &s;hall be deemed to be free and ex|empt which &s;hall be found on board the &s;hips belonging to the &s;ubjects of either of the confederates, although the whole lad|ing, or any part thereof &s;hould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is al&s;o agreed in like manner, that the &s;ame liberty be extended to per|&s;ons who are on board a free &s;hip, with their effects; that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free &s;hip, unle&s;s they are &s;oldiers, and in actual &s;ervice of the enemies."</P>
<P>If Mr. Pitt had graciou&s;ly permitted Mr. Jay to in&s;ert a &s;imi|lar &s;tipulation in the treaty before us, in what an envied &s;itua|tion
<PB N="158" REF="028389_0445_0FD8EB9E5BD7AB98">would it have placed America! At pre&s;ent, &s;he mu&s;t even forego the advantages &s;he might derive from the French treaty for if we permit the Engli&s;h to &s;eize French property on bound our ve&s;&s;els, can it be expected that France will ab&s;tain from &s;imilar treatment? Between the two, what is to become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> American ve&s;&s;els? Let Mr. Jay and his friends an&s;wer. In the twenty-fourth article of our treaty with the United Netherlands, the "liberty of navingation and commerce is extended to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of merchandizes, excepting only tho&s;e which are di&s;tingui&s;hed under the name of contraband or merchandizes prohibited." What the&s;e are, will be &s;een by and by, "&s;o that all effects and merchandizes," continues this article, "which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;sly before named, may, without any exception, and in perfect liberty, be tran&s;ported by the &s;ubjects and inhabitans of both allies, from and to places, belonging to the enemy, excepting only the places which at the &s;ame time &s;hall be be|&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted, and the&s;e places &s;hall only be held for &s;uch, which are &s;urrounded, nearly, by &s;ome of the belligerent powers." In our treaty with Sweden, we find the &s;ame regard paid to our mutual intere&s;ts. The &s;eventh arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> de&s;erves to be copied at full length, as a contra&s;t to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame &s;ubject in the Engli&s;h treaty.

It is in the&s;e words: "All and every the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the kingdom of Sweden, as well as tho&s;e of the United States, &s;hall be permitted to navigate with their ve&s;&s;els in <HI>all &s;afety and freedom, and without any regard to tho&s;e to whom the merchandizes and cargoes may belong, from any part whatever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the two &s;tates &s;hall likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> permitted to &s;ail and trade with their ve&s;&s;els, and with the &s;ave liberty and &s;afety to frequent the places, ports, and havens of powers, enemies to both or either of the contracting parties, with|out being in any wi&s;e mola&s;ted or troubled,</HI> and to carry on a com|merce, not only directly from the ports of an enemy to a newtral port, but even from one port of an enemy to another port of an enemy, whether it be under the juri&s;diction of the &s;ame, or of different princes.

After peru&s;ing the&s;e &s;everal articles of our treaties with other nations, let the reader return to the one which has excited this compa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, and mourn over the lo&s;t dignity and intere&s;ts of his country. It will be &s;aid that by the laws of nations, free ve&s;&s;els <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not make free goods. That this was the ca&s;e formerly is con|ceded; but when tho&s;e nations which have a right to alter this law are u&s;ing their utmo&s;t efforts to bring about a change, dic|tated by humanity and rea&s;on, why &s;hould we formally give our a&s;&s;ent to a mea&s;ure which mu&s;t not only retard this ameliora|tion, but deprive us of the &s;alutary operation of the treaties we have already made? We &s;hall be told, as in other ca&s;es, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Mr. Pitt in&s;i&s;ted upon this &s;tipulation, and that the terms were the be&s;t which Mr. Jay could obtain.

<HEAD>Remarks on Mr. Charles Pinckney's Speech.</HEAD>
<P>[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 111.]</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the negociation about the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in 1786, which &s;eems to be dragged in here without any obvious propriety, it may be remembered, that Mr. Jay's opinion, on that occa&s;ion, had the &s;anction of a majority of congre&s;s&mdash;that it was <HI>then</HI> thought, by many of the wi&s;e&s;t men in America, a &s;alutary arrangement for the <HI>Atlantic &s;tates</HI>&mdash; that the ea&s;tern &s;tates were generally of that opinion&mdash;that a minority in congre&s;s, for the benefit of a &s;mall part of the union, ob&s;tructed a mea&s;ure which was then deemed generally be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i|al&mdash;and that even <HI>now</HI> it may be con&s;idered as problematical, whether the arrangement would not have eventuated more be|neficially for the we&s;tern territory than any other which can be promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>in&s;inuation</HI> again&s;t <HI>the pre&s;ident,</HI> for having &s;ent a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who has &s;hown him&s;elf "&s;o uninformed of the commecial intere&s;ts of his country, and &s;o mi&s;erably deficient in the talents of a negociator, and for having oppo&s;ed him &s;ingly, and at their own court, to the talents, experience, and, perhaps, <HI>temptations</HI> of their able&s;t &s;tate&s;men," will fail of its intended effect. Mr. Jay's conduct in Spain, in France at the treaty of 1783, his talents and experience, and <HI>known integrity,</HI> were &s;ufficient inducements with the pre&s;ident to &s;elect him for this mi&s;&s;ion. There may indeed be <HI>men,</HI> who&s;e <HI>vanity</HI> may lead them to believe, that <HI>they</HI> would have negociated a better trea|ty&mdash;men, no more to be compared to Mr. Jay, for <HI>virtue or abilities,</HI> than a farthing candle to the &s;un, and who&s;e <HI>vanity,</HI> in &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves his &s;uperiors, in the&s;e re&s;pects, can only be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by their <HI>folly,</HI> in having had <HI>preten&s;ions and expecta|tions</HI> &s;o ill-founded and ridiculous.</P>
<P>In complaining of the article relating to Briti&s;h debts, the &s;peech ob&s;erves, that the creditors had long &s;ince made up their minds on certain points, and that by far the greater number of ca&s;es have been &s;ettled by &s;uit or compromi&s;e; &s;o much the better; all tho&s;e ca&s;es, in which the creditors have been &s;atis|fied, will not be touched by the treaty. The article will only affect the others, where the debtors are in&s;olvent. If Mr. Jay, in his negociation of the treaty of 1783, hone&s;tly meant, that
<PB N="161" REF="028389_0448_0FD8EBA5C31058F8">bona fide debts were to be paid, it would have been incon&s;i&s;tent in him to deny it, either as judge or &s;ecretary of foreign affairs: <HI>Humanity</HI> is perhaps as much concerned in paying a fair debt to a factor or agent in England, who had &s;hipped goods to this country, and was re&s;pon&s;ible to the manufacturers, and liable to be impri&s;oned there for non-payment, as in &s;hielding from the law a rich debtor in this, who withheld payment: <HI>Honor</HI> as much required that our national faith &s;hould be kept, and that bona fide debts &s;hould be paid by &s;olvent debtors. The &s;ti|pulation agreed to by Mr. Jay is not to di&s;tre&s;s individuals, but to make the nation an&s;werable for lo&s;&s;es ari&s;ing from a breach of the treaty.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of &s;poliations, the &s;peech chalks out the line of conduct Mr. Jay &s;hould have taken: "He &s;hould have re|quired <HI>immediate</HI> &s;atisfaction; if refu&s;ed, he &s;hould have <HI>quitted</HI> their court, and left it to his country to have determined what other mea&s;ures were to be pur&s;ued: but, in&s;tead of this, he has accepted a <HI>remote, expen&s;ive,</HI> and uncertain remedy." This is the line of conduct the &s;peaker would leave taken: "his demand &s;hould have been <HI>&s;pirited</HI> and po&s;itive&mdash;no alternative would have been offered." But &s;uppo&s;e his in&s;tructions had not been of that <HI>&s;pirited</HI> and po&s;itive nature, and that <HI>&s;ome other alternative</HI> had been pointed out by them&mdash;and he had di&s;obey|ed them, after having accepted the mi&s;&s;ion, knowing tho&s;e in|&s;tructions? On his return, he would have been univer&s;ally condemned, and &s;ome other <HI>le&s;s po&s;itive</HI> gentleman would have been &s;ent. The former mini&s;ter at that court, as di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for his &s;pirit as his virtues, but who&s;e &s;pirit, regulated by good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound di&s;cretion, would have been more wi&s;ely directed, complained for &s;everal months to the Briti&s;h court, of the &s;poliations committed under the orders of the 8th of June, 1793, without threatening to quit the country: in this, he conformed to the in&s;tructions of the executive; in Mr. Jef|fer&s;on's letter to Mr. Pinckney, of September 7, 1793, after complaining of tho&s;e &s;poliations, he adds, "The pre&s;ident, therefore, de&s;ires that you will immediately enter into expla|nations, on this &s;ubject, with the Briti&s;h government. Lay before them, in <HI>friendly</HI> and <HI>temperate</HI> terms, all the demon|&s;trations of the injury done us by this act, and endeavour to obtain a revocation of it, and full indemnification to any citi|zens of the&s;e &s;tates, who may have &s;uffered by it in the mean time. Accompany your repre&s;entations with every <HI>a&s;&s;ur|ance of our earne&s;t de&s;ire to live on terms of the be&s;t friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> with them, and to found our expectations of ju&s;tice on their part, on a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of it on ours. De&s;irous of
<PB N="162" REF="028389_0449_0FD8EBA8524D16D0">furni&s;hing no colour of offence, we do not wi&s;h you to name to them <HI>any term for giving an an&s;wer:</HI> urge one as much as you can, <HI>without commitment.</HI>" The remedy accepted by Mr. Jay, is probably the remedy de&s;ignated in his in&s;tructions; it is cer|tainly the u&s;ual remedy in &s;imilar ca&s;es. But it is called <HI>remote;</HI> and what would the &s;peech have &s;ub&s;tituted? Why Mr. Jay mu&s;t have quitted Great Britain, made his report to the pre&s;i|dent, who mu&s;t thereupon have convened the &s;enate, according to the doctrine laid down in the &s;peech, to recon&s;ider their in|&s;tructions, and, after all, at the di&s;tance of many months, the &s;enate would have done preci&s;ely what they have done&mdash;advi&s;ed the pre&s;ident to accept the terms: Mr. Jay would have returned to England, and this <HI>remote</HI> remedy would have been made <HI>more remote</HI> by at lea&s;t a twelvemonth: it is called <HI>expen&s;ive;</HI> and what would the &s;peech &s;ub&s;titute? Why, Mr. Jay mu&s;t have returned home, and the United States, after the expen&s;e of &s;ome thou&s;and dollars for the extra &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;enate, mu&s;t either have had the expen&s;e of another emba&s;&s;y, or the more &s;erious expen&s;e of <HI>ten or fifteen millions of dollars</HI> by a war, to obtain a compen&s;ation of <HI>half a million!!</HI> The remedy pointed out by the &s;peech does not then appear preferable to Mr. Jay's.</P>
<P>Mr. Jay is next charged with having, in the mo&s;t conde&s;cend|ing manner, <HI>&s;tipulated</HI> that <HI>all</HI> prizes brought in, &amp;c. &s;hall be paid for, &amp;c. Mr. Jay <HI>&s;tipulated</HI> no &s;uch thing. The pre&s;ident and &s;tipulated in 1793, that <HI>certain</HI> prizes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;pecified in Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter, annexed to the treaty, &s;hould be paid for. Mr. Jay, conformably to that letter and his in&s;tructions, agrees that the ca&s;es not already paid for, coming within the princi|ples therein fixed, &s;hall be referred to the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>After the &s;peech had informed us that the 12th article was held in general dete&s;tation by our own citizens, it may appear &s;uperfluous to add the dete&s;tation of <HI>foreigners.</HI> The dete&s;tation of <HI>our own citizens</HI> was quite &s;ufficient to condemn it. But the flouri&s;h about our friends &s;eems mi&s;applied. The articles, prohi|bited by that article, are mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton: It may be <HI>queried</HI> whether our ve&s;&s;els carry much of them to &s;upply our friends; the general cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent trade of re-export in tho&s;e articles, &s;eems to be to other parts of Europe. It is not, however, meant to contend this point, with tho&s;e <HI>who have obtained the be&s;t mercantile information.</HI></P>
<P>The animadver&s;ion on the article re&s;pecting the Ea&s;t India trade, is either not under&s;tood, or the article it&s;elf is not un|der&s;tood by the commentator. It permits the citizens of the United States "to carry on freely a trade between the Briti&s;h territories in the Ea&s;t Indies and the United States, in all arti|cles
<PB N="163" REF="028389_0450_0FD8EBA948523408">of which the importation or exportation re&s;pectively, to or from the &s;aid territories, &s;hall not be entirely prohibited; that is, it places our citizens upon the &s;ame footing exactly as the Ea&s;t India company, and upon <HI>a better footing than the peo|ple of Great Britain,</HI> who cannot carry on &s;uch trade. Becau&s;e advantages favorable to the United States are conceded in this article, the notable di&s;covery is now made, that the trade is in|jurious; &s;o the &s;ame per&s;ons, who a few years ago would have rejoiced at a &s;tipulation, permitting our ve&s;&s;els of 60 tons to enter the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, now call the &s;tipulation for 70 tons a <HI>paltry</HI> allowance. Had the Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies been &s;hut to us by the treaty, what clamour &s;hould we not have heard at being deprived of &s;uch ine&s;timable advantages?</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that the complaint again&s;t Mr. Jay. for recognizing the right to &s;earch our ve&s;&s;els on &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemy's pro|perty, is ill &s;ounded: A recurrence to <HI>Vattel, who&s;e authority,</HI> the &s;peech tells us, is <HI>not to be doubted,</HI> and to Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letters, authorities equally undoubted, will confirm the a&s;&s;ertion. Pre&s;ent experience proves, that the &s;peaker is altogether mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays, "that, if we recognize this right, we mu&s;t give up the idea of benefitting by the di&s;&s;entions of European powers, and becoming their carriers, and that our commerce will be pro&s;trated at the &s;ect of the maritime powers." One would &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>a per&s;on who had obtained the be&s;t mer|cantile information,</HI> would have known, that, notwith&s;tanding Mr. Jeffer&s;on, our &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in conformity with the doctrine of <HI>that undoubted authority, Vattel,</HI> did, two years ago, recognize that right, and the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els of war have con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed it, yet that <HI>our carrying trade has increa&s;ed, and our commerce has flouri&s;hed, within the two la&s;t years, in a manner unexampled in the hi&s;tory of nations.</HI> And what is very extraordinary, the &s;peaker, in contradiction to his own a&s;&s;er|tions in this place, tells us in another, that the <HI>American com|merce and navigation flouri&s;hed</HI> beyond all former example and <HI>almo&s;t to exceed belief;</HI> and that <HI>now, American</HI> merchants, in Charle&s;ton, carry on all the trade, and own more than &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els of large &s;ize, and a much greater proportion of &s;maller ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t India trade; all this, in &s;pite of the recog|nition of that alarming right made two years ago, and in &s;pite of the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of it, which is, <HI>to de&s;troy our carrying trade</HI> and <HI>pro&s;trate our commerce!</HI> To be &s;ure, there mu&s;t have been a wonderful exertion of ingenuity to collect together in one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of a new&s;paper, &s;o many contradictions!</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="028389_0451_0FD8EBAACD97C450">
This part of the treaty &s;eems to be the mo&s;t offen&s;ive to the &s;peaker; it is the article which has brought down upon Mr. Jay his mo&s;t &s;evere reprobation; he con&s;iders it the mo&s;t import|ant, the <HI>mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly injurious to our commerce;</HI> and if there had been no other objection, Mr. Jay &s;hould have refu&s;ed to &s;ign the treaty. And yet, wonderful to relate, it is perfectly conformable to the law of nations, as laid down by that <HI>un|doubted authority, Vattel;</HI> it is recognized by our government, and, under the exerci&s;e of it, in&s;tead of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;erious injury</HI> to our commerce, <HI>our commerce and navigation have flouri&s;hed, almo&s;t to exceed belief.</HI> In &s;hort, if there is any part of the treaty le&s;s liable to objection than another, <HI>this is the article.</HI></P>
<P>To compel Great Britain and other maritime powers (for the northern powers have now given up this point) to change the acknowledged law of nations, the &s;peech recommends the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a navy of twelve &s;ail of the line and a few frigates. However &s;uch a thing may be de&s;irable, and may here|after be expedient, the idea of an early e&s;tabli&s;hment of that kind is perfectly chimerical. To protect our commerce from the depredations of the Algerines, congre&s;s re&s;olved, in Janu|ary, 1794, to build and equip &s;ix frigates: <HI>At this day,</HI> the keels are &s;carcely laid; when they will be launched, God knows; when that happens, there is but little pro&s;pect of their being manned; and if they are, they will float at an expen&s;e of a million and a half of dollars outfit, and half a million of an|nual expen&s;e, without allowing for misfortunes or contingen|cies. &mdash;What the expen&s;e of the &s;peaker's <HI>navy</HI> will be, may be ea&s;ily computed. Seven or eight millions of dollars for outfit, and two or three millions of annual expen&s;e, will not come up to the mark. Nor is that the principal difficulty: This fleet will be wanted during the wars of the maritime powers, to protect our commerce and pre&s;erve our neutral rights.&mdash;But, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the exten&s;ion of our carrying trade ab&s;orbs all our &s;eamen; and if any could be obtained for the public &s;hips, it would be at an intolerable expen&s;e. If we &s;hould be at war, then the &s;pirit of privateering would draw off the greate&s;t part of our &s;eamen. And after all, what would ten or twelve &s;hips of the line and a few frigates accompli&s;h, when oppo&s;ed to the enormous fleets of the maritime powers of Europe? Whate|ver, therefore, we may do in the article of a navy &s;ome years hence, it is &s;elf-evident, that our &s;trength and re&s;ources mu&s;t at pre&s;ent be applied again&s;t our enemies in a very different &s;hape.</P>
<P>On the 14th and 15th articles, it is remarked in the &s;peech, that the fir&s;t clau&s;e places the ve&s;&s;els of America on the &s;ame
<PB N="165" REF="028389_0452_0FD8EBACCA750850">footing with tho&s;e of other foreign nations, <HI>which is as much as we could of right expect, con&s;i&s;tent with their obligations to other nations:</HI> But that by this rule, American ve&s;&s;els going to their European ports pay from 15 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> on a ve&s;&s;el of 150 to 200 tons, more than a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el. Certainly we cannot complain, if we are put on the footing of the mo&s;t favored nation: as to the extra duty, paid by American ve&s;&s;els in all the ports of England, <HI>but London,</HI> for <HI>light money,</HI> which is one &s;hilling and nine-pence per ton, it is the &s;ame as is paid by all other foreign nations; in all other re&s;pects, our &s;hips are upon the <HI>&s;ame footing</HI> with tho&s;e of Great Britain. It is here worthy of remark, that the <HI>extra</HI> duty paid in the United States by a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, more than an American, is greater than the <HI>extra</HI> duty paid in Great Britain by an American ve&s;&s;el, more than a Briti&s;h; for example, in the United States an American ve&s;&s;el pays &s;ix cents, a Briti&s;h fifty cents, per ton; the difference on a ve&s;&s;el of 200 tons is twenty pounds ten &s;hillings and eight-pence, and on a ve&s;&s;el of 300 tons, twenty-nine pounds &s;ixteen &s;hil|lings&mdash;be&s;ides the difference of ten per cent on the duties; whereas the difference in England, in favor of a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el of 200 tons, is only &s;eventeen pounds ten &s;hillings, and of 300, only twenty-&s;ix pounds five &s;hillings, and no di&s;crimina|tion in the duties: And, in one re&s;pect, our ve&s;&s;els are on a <HI>better footing</HI> in England than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t favored nation; for while they pay upon the carriage of &s;everal of their own commodities, additional duties, called <HI>alien duties,</HI> our &s;hips are exempt from them.</P>
<P>In 1789, congre&s;s laid a tonnage duty of 25 cents per ton on all foreign ve&s;&s;els, and made the di&s;crimination of ten per cent. on the duties on goods imported, in favor of American bottoms, as above mentioned. In 1790, the tonnage duty was increa&s;ed to 50 cents, not in con&s;equence of the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age, as &s;tated in the &s;peech, which was in February 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (not 1790). That me&s;&s;age provoked no commercial re&s;triction <HI>at that time,</HI> but was the foundation of a reference to the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, which produced his report, in January 1794. An examination of this part of the &s;peech furni&s;hes another &s;triking contradiction; it is here &s;aid, "that our fellow citi|zens at the northward have had exclu&s;ively the <HI>India trade,</HI> by which, be&s;ides &s;upplying our own citizens with A&s;iatic goods, at <HI>one fourth</HI> the price they were before the revolution, they have <HI>exported them to the We&s;t Indies, and even to Europe, mak|ing thereby the balance of trade more favorable to the United States.</HI>" The &s;peaker, in thus excelling the benefits of the Ea&s;t India trade, mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly have <HI>forgot</HI> his attempt to <HI>di&s;parage</HI> that
<PB N="166" REF="028389_0453_0FD8EBB117F03C20">trade, in a preceding paragraph, where he was obliged to men|tion &s;ome advantage acquired by the treaty, and his having therein &s;aid, "that the <HI>advantage</HI> was <HI>delu&s;ive;</HI> that an exten|&s;ive trade to the Ea&s;t Indies was <HI>injurious;</HI> becau&s;e, at an im|men&s;e expen&s;e, we import from thence nothing but articles of mere luxury, mo&s;t of which, except tea, we could do very well without, or procure el&s;ewhere, in exchange for our pro|ductions; and they take from us, in payment, &s;carcely any thing but &s;pecie."</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;trictions, on the part of our government, it is &s;aid, did not produce any counter re&s;trictions, on the part of England. But the merchants of &s;everal large commercial cities in Great Britain, as appears by the report to the privy coun|cil, in the &s;pring 1791, <HI>did complain</HI> of them as being <HI>un-reci|procal,</HI> as impo&s;ing burdens on their navigation and commerce in our ports, which they did not impo&s;e on our navigation and commerce in theirs. In fact, the &s;ole di&s;crimination of ten per cent. on the duties in favor of American bottoms, &s;econd nearly the monopoly of the carriage of the manufactures of Great Britain to this country, and was &s;everely felt by the &s;hip-owners of the&s;e cities. They were wi&s;e enough, however, to recommend <HI>negociation</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>retaliation</HI> to the privy council, Mr. Hammond was &s;ent to the United States; and our government conceiving, that, notwith&s;tanding we had im|po&s;ed certain re&s;trictions on the commerce of England, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our intercour&s;e was not on &s;uch a footing as we had a right to expect: Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in his very fir&s;t letter to Mr. Hammond, of 29th November, 1791, &s;ays, "with re&s;pect to the com|merce of the two countries, we have &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;aw, in &s;everal in&s;tances, regulations on the part of your government, which, if reciprocally adopted, would materially injure the in|tere&s;ts of both nations: On this &s;ubject, too, I mu&s;t beg the favor of you to &s;ay, whether you are authorized to conclude or to negociate arrangements with us, which may fix the com|merce between the two countries on principles of reciprocal advantage?" In reply to this letter, Mr. Hammond a&s;&s;ured him, that though he was not authorized to <HI>conclude,</HI> yet he was fully authorized to <HI>enter on</HI> a negociation on that &s;ubject: Mr. Jef|fer&s;on, conceiving that &s;uch authority was inadequate, drop|ped the &s;ubject, and confined his en&s;uing negociations entirely to the infractions of the treaty. The&s;e facts, while they de|mon&s;trate that a di&s;po&s;ition exi&s;ted, on the part of our govern|ment, &s;o long ago as November, 1791, to enter into a com|mercial treaty with England, exculpate, at the &s;ame time, Mr.
<PB N="167" REF="028389_0454_0FD8EBB309D10020">Jay, altogether, from the charges in&s;inuated again&s;t him of having volunteered the&s;e commercial arrangements.</P>
<P>The &s;peech proceeds to ob&s;erve, that "at this moment Mr. Jay <HI>concedes,</HI> in the &s;econd &s;ection of the 15th article, the fol|lowing provi&s;o. "But the Briti&s;h government re&s;erves to it&s;elf the right of impo&s;ing on American ve&s;&s;els, entering into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which &s;hall be payable by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the ports of America, and al&s;o &s;uch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and A&s;i|atic goods, when imported into the United States, in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els." There is <HI>no conce&s;&s;ion</HI> by Mr. Jay: the Bri|ti&s;h government actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right to lay &s;uch counter|vailing duties, and might have exerci&s;ed it whenever it was thought expedient; it could not be expected that, after declar|ing that the intercour&s;e between the two countries &s;hould be car|ried on, on principles of perfect reciprocity, we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on continuing certain di&s;criminating duties, and bind the other party up from reciprocating them: this would have been incon|&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, after making the want of reciprocity on their part, the ba&s;is of our commercial complaints. The &s;peech it|&s;elf in another place, acknowledges that their receiving our ve&s;&s;els on the &s;ame footing as other foreign nations, "was perhaps as much as we could of right expect, con&s;i&s;tent with their obliga|tions to other nations;" and yet, it has been &s;hown that in &s;ome in&s;tances, our ve&s;&s;els are, by exi&s;ting regulations, received on better terms than tho&s;e of other nations. This being the ca&s;e, could we expect that they &s;hould &s;urrender by treaty, a right which <HI>we</HI> re&s;erve to <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and which <HI>they</HI> have re&s;erved in relation to <HI>all other nations?</HI> The French have re&s;erved in their treaty with us, a &s;imilar right; and no nation can ever be re|quired to relinqui&s;h it.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulation, "that the United States will not impo&s;e any new or additional tonnage duties, on Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, nor increa&s;e the now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting difference between the duties pay a|ble on the importation of any articles in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els," is &s;aid, in the &s;peech, to be calculated "to induce the Briti&s;h &s;hippers to refu&s;e a credit to our merchants, unle&s;s they &s;hip their goods in Briti&s;h bottoms."</P>
<P><HI>Credit</HI> being, in the opinion of many modern theori&s;ts, a very bad thing, if the clau&s;e &s;hould produce the expected ope|ration, it will, in their opinion, certainly do &s;ome good. But it is &s;urpri&s;ing that this operation &s;hould not have taken place ever &s;ince the year 1789, when the difference of duties com|menced. The operation has, during a period of &s;ix years been
<PB N="168" REF="028389_0455_0FD8EBB4AD8C8D90">quite the rever&s;e of the &s;peaker's &s;ugge&s;tion; for notwith&s;tand|ing the difference of tonnage duty and the di&s;crimination of ten per cent. the Briti&s;h merchants have &s;hipped their goods in American bottoms, and given the u&s;ual credit to our merchants; and the &s;peaker tells us, that by the operation of tho&s;e duties, <HI>our commerce and navigation have flouri&s;hed almo&s;t to exceed belief.</HI> How then an agreement <HI>not</HI> to increa&s;e tho&s;e duties &s;hould pro|voke an ho&s;tility of di&s;po&s;ition on the part of the Briti&s;h mer|chants, which has not for &s;ix years exi&s;ted, when there was <HI>no</HI> &s;uch agreement not to increa&s;e them, is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered!! The &s;peech &s;ays further, on this article, "That it is not an extrava|gant idea to pre&s;ume, that the wealth of the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India company may be employed to cru&s;h the American merchants now in this trade (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Ea&s;t India trade) that they afterwards may enjoy the monopoly of it."</P>
<P>If the re&s;trictions on Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India ve&s;&s;els have been hi|therto &s;o effectual as "to &s;ecure the exclu&s;ive trade to our north|ern fellow citizens," as the &s;peech informs us, it does not well appear how agreeing not to increa&s;e tho&s;e re&s;trictions will give the monopoly to the Briti&s;h; the idea, if not extravagant, is certainly a very extraordinary one. The import of this article is merely, that we will not increa&s;e the di&s;criminations now &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting; why &s;hould we, when they have been found <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to rai&s;e our commerce and navigation to a pitch of pro&s;perity <HI>almo&s;t to exceed belief</HI>&mdash;when we thereby prevent the other party from impo&s;ing on our commerce higher than corre&s;ponding du|ties, and when, in fact, the whole article will be again in our power <HI>in the cour&s;e of two or three years?</HI></P>
<P>It is then &s;aid, "that by treaties now exi&s;ting with other nations, they are to be u&s;ed as the mo&s;t favored nation&mdash;and having of right the &s;ame privilege of counteracting the di&s;cri|minating duties, they will, of cour&s;e, exerci&s;e it." And have they not &s;uch a right at pre&s;ent? unque&s;tionably. Can we now impo&s;e on any nation with whom we have a treaty, any di&s;cri|minating duties, which &s;he cannot counteract? And if, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing that right, the di&s;criminating duties which have been im|po&s;ed for &s;ix years, have not had injurious con&s;equences, but on the contrary have rai&s;ed our commerce and navigation to the highe&s;t pro&s;perity, then none but the <HI>meane&s;t</HI> capacity can &s;ee in this clau&s;e the &s;peedy and total de&s;truction of American na|vigation.</P>
<P>We are next told, that by other articles of the treaty, the catalogue of contraband articles is increa&s;ed, and attempts are made to make even <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> come under this de&s;cription. With re&s;pect to <HI>provi&s;ions,</HI> the article &s;eems mi&s;under&s;tood. <HI>Vatth,

After di&s;cu&s;&s;ions on that point, what is &s;tipulated in the treaty? The Briti&s;h government en|gage, that whenever provi&s;ions &s;hall become contraband, ac|cording to the exi&s;ting <HI>law of nations,</HI> they <HI>&s;hall not be confi&s;|cated,</HI> but the owners &s;hall be indemnified, with a rea&s;onable mercantile profit, with freight and demurrage. What then was Mr. Jay given up? It is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that the &s;eizures &s;hall be only in ca&s;es where they are warranted by <HI>the exi&s;ting law of nations:</HI> Mr. Jay refu&s;ed to acknowledge that they were contraband by the law of nations in any particular ca&s;e; he would not con&s;ent to a &s;pecification of any one ca&s;e; he would not &s;tipulate for any one thing which might preclude us from <HI>denying the exi&s;tence</HI> of &s;uch a law of nations: the introductory part of the clau&s;e is, therefore, to this effect; "whereas the <HI>difficulty</HI> of agreeing on the <HI>preci&s;e ca&s;es,</HI> in which <HI>alone,</HI> provi|&s;ions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be regarded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniencies and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e," &amp;c. If the Briti&s;h government in&s;i&s;ted, that in certain ca&s;es mentioned, provi&s;ions were contraband, and Mr. Jay in&s;i&s;ted that they were not, and on appealing to <HI>Vattel,</HI> it was found that &s;uch was the opinion of that writer&mdash;if, further, the law of nations was &s;uppo&s;ed to give, in the ca&s;es mentioned, the right not only of &s;eizing, but of <HI>confi&s;cating</HI> &s;uch provi&s;ions, and there was no other mode of deciding ultimately on the right, but by an appeal to the &s;word; Mr. Jay may have con|ceived, that he was making the be&s;t terms for our citizens, by &s;tipulating, that where, by <HI>the exi&s;ting law of nations,</HI> and in tho&s;e ca&s;es only, provi&s;ions &s;hould be contraband, that they &s;hould <HI>not be confi&s;cated,</HI> but paid for with a mercantile profit, and freight and demurrage. By this clau&s;e, nothing appears to be given up by our government, which may continue to <HI>deny</HI> the exi&s;tence of &s;uch right, under the law of nations, and to re&s;i&s;t it either by remon&s;trance, by commercial regulations, or by arms. In the mean time, and until the que&s;tion &s;hall be decided, our citizens will be paid for their property, in&s;tead of having it confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>But admitting the clau&s;e to be an injurious one, the &s;peaker, of all per&s;ons, &s;eems to be <HI>the lea&s;t entitled to complain.</HI> He has
<PB N="170" REF="028389_0457_0FD8EBBB48624550">told us that <HI>Vattel</HI> is an author of <HI>undoubted authority,</HI> and he has al&s;o told us, "that if Mr. Jay had attempted to &s;ay a word in favor of the claims of his countrymen, <HI>his opponent had only to &s;how him his own opinions, and his lips mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly clo&s;ed.</HI>" Suppo&s;e, then, the &s;peaker, in&s;tead of Mr. Jay, had been &s;ent on this mi&s;&s;ion, and Lord Grenville had di&s;covered, in the cour&s;e of the negociation, that the &s;peaker thought <HI>Vattel</HI> a writer of <HI>undoubted authority,</HI> and, that on his denying the autho|rity under the law of nations to make provi&s;ions contraband in any ca&s;e whatever, Lord Grenville had produced an a&s;&s;ertion from Vattel to this effect, that "all provi&s;ions are to be con&s;i|dered as contraband, and as &s;uch <HI>liable to confi&s;cation,</HI> in the ca&s;e where the depriving an enemy of the&s;e &s;upplies, is one of the means intended to be employed for reducing him to rea&s;onable terms of peace:" What could our negociator have replied? "Had he attempted to &s;ay a word in favor of the claims of his countrymen, <HI>his opponent had only to &s;how him his own opi|nions, and his lips mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly clo&s;ed.</HI>" According, then, to his own a&s;&s;ertions and doctrines, Mr. Jay has obtained much better terms, in relation to this point, than <HI>he</HI> could have done. He proceeds to remark, that "whenever there is a war between the maritime powers, the danger of &s;eizure and con|demnation to us will be as great <HI>as if we were actually at war our&s;elves.</HI>" The experience of the la&s;t two years, and his own &s;tatement of the <HI>flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our navigation,</HI> during that period, are &s;ufficient refutations of that a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In his comments on the 23d, 24th, and 25th articles, he un|ju&s;tly charges Mr. Jay with endeavoring to render this country as unfriendly as he could to the French; and nothing can be more unfounded than the whole of this charge; there is not a tittle of it which can bear the te&s;t of truth; there is not a tittle of tho&s;e three articles which can produce any &s;uch effect; there is not an argument to prove it; the whole is mere vague decla|mation. One would &s;uppo&s;e, that a per&s;on who had taken &s;o much pains to acquire the be&s;t mercantile information, and who had &s;o high an opinion of <HI>Vattei's</HI> authority, would have be&s;towed &s;ome pains on a peru&s;al of the French treaty, on the peru&s;al of the treaty under con&s;ideration, and then would have read <HI>Vattel</HI> on the &s;ubject of treaties: Had he pur&s;ued this cour&s;e, it mu&s;t have re&s;ulted in a full conviction, that <HI>the French treaty &s;tands completely unimpaired in every point:</HI> he would have learned, that in the con&s;truction of treaties, a dif|ferent rule prevails from the con&s;truction of laws, and that a po&s;terior treaty does not abrogate a prior one; that Mr. Jay, notwith&s;tanding this rule (that nothing might be left to con|&s;truction)
<PB N="171" REF="028389_0458_0FD8EBBFCAA12160">has in&s;erted an expre&s;s &s;tipulation, that no part of this treaty &s;hall, in any wi&s;e, be con&s;trued to affect or impair any former treaty; and that, con&s;equently, whenever there is a war between France and England, the French treaty will be paramount in every re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h treaty, and the French will enjoy in our ports, to the exclu&s;ion of the Briti&s;h, every right and advantage now &s;ecured to them by their treaty.</P>
<P>Such are the &s;trictures on the &s;everal clau&s;es of the treaty: The re&s;t of the &s;peech con&s;i&s;ts of mi&s;cellaneous remarks which &s;hall not be overlooked.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t which occurs, is a very ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, and we have to regret that it is &s;o &s;oon after flatly contradicted. It is this, "that <HI>equality</HI> mu&s;t be the ba&s;is of every la&s;ting treaty, for without equality, few treaties can la&s;t." The contradiction which follows it is this; "all <HI>the policy of a nation</HI> &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in a re&s;olution never to think of forming treaties of commerce, until it finds it&s;elf in &s;ome happy circum&s;tances which may au|thorize it to <HI>demand prerogatives</HI> of foreign powers, without purcha&s;ing them even <HI>with equivalents.</HI>" Which of the&s;e po&s;i|tions does the &s;peaker mean to inculcate? are we, in the con|&s;truction of his &s;peech, to follow the rule which applies to the con&s;truction of laws or treaties? if we ob&s;erve the one, then the latter po&s;ition abrogates the former; if we ob&s;erve the other, then the fir&s;t po&s;ition &s;tands unimpaired: in this dilem|ma, perhaps the be&s;t clue to his intentions is the de&s;ire he has &s;hown of exhibiting the la&s;t po&s;ition in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, and that the &s;entiment <HI>in capitals,</HI> is the capital &s;entiment he wi&s;hes to enforce. In this idea we may be confirmed by the general tenor of his ob&s;ervations, which inculcate <HI>inequality</HI> in treaties as their only ba&s;is.&mdash;If the &s;peaker thinks no treaty can be <HI>la&s;ting</HI> without equality, what mu&s;t we think of his wi&s;e po|licy, which recommends treaties without equality? If <HI>all</HI> nati|ons ought to pur&s;ue thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;e policy&mdash;if both parties are to demand prerogatives, and not purcha&s;e them with equivalents &mdash;it requires con&s;iderable ingenuity to di&s;cover, how treaties can ever be made: this is a new kind of reciprocity, with the benefits all on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks, which the ingenuity of the &s;peaker alone can reconcile, are followed by two indecent in&s;inuations, one again&s;t Mr. Jay, the other again&s;t the pre&s;ident. The fir&s;t is, "that there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>other rea&s;ons</HI> for the&s;e <HI>uncommon</HI> &s;ur|renders, upon which the public are not yet &s;ufficiently inform|ed." &mdash;This in&s;inuation, coupled with the allu&s;ion to Mr. Jay's having been expo&s;ed to the <HI>temptations</HI> of the Briti&s;h court, and another allu&s;ion at the clo&s;e of the &s;peech, though couch|ed
<PB N="172" REF="028389_0459_0FD8EBC149A16888">in more ambiguous and decorous language, than was either &s;poken at St. Michael's, or retailed afterwards in the public prints, leaves no room to doubt a wi&s;h to fix, in the public mind, a marked imputation on the <HI>moral character</HI> of <HI>Mr. Jay.</HI> If Mr. Jay has, from corrupt motives, &s;acrificed his country's intere&s;ts, I mo&s;t &s;incerely pray to God he may be detected and puni&s;hed; but his &s;igning the treaty is not in it|&s;elf a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion or in&s;inuation: As well may we &s;u&s;pect the twenty &s;enators, among whom are men as pure and virtuous as ever breathed. He mu&s;t either have been very unfortunate in his intercour&s;e with the world, or po&s;&s;e&s;s a mind <HI>very &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> as well as a heart very liable to be &s;haken, who can think it probable, that two thirds of the &s;enate, as well as Mr. Jay, have been guilty of &s;uch infamy. The idea is too gro&s;s and too invidious to be entertained. Should it, however, be found to be the ca&s;e, the treaty, like other fraudulent contracts, would be null and void by the law of nations. In this charge, it has not, how|ever, been even &s;hown, what the&s;e uncommon &s;urrenders are, and wherein they differ from the &s;tipulations in our former treaties.</P>

<P>No one will deny, that "any treaty which may operate to le&s;&s;en our &s;hipping, and de&s;troy that competition which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for our obtaining a proper price for our &s;taples, be|comes a matter of &s;erious concern." But has it been proved, that the commercial articles of this treaty, as ratified by the &s;enate, will produce this effect? Is there any thing in them, which dimini&s;hes, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, the efficacy of tho&s;e regulations, which have given &s;uch a &s;pring to our commerce? Not a &s;yllable.

There is one thing, and one only, which would be &s;till wor&s;e, and that is, WAR, which &s;eems
<PB N="173" REF="028389_0460_0FD8EBC493FC2278">to be now a favorite mea&s;ure with many, who would perhaps be among the fir&s;t to be tired of it.</P>
<P>The remainder of the &s;peech con&s;i&s;ts of &s;undry objections &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;lated in the committee's report, and of general principles, applicable to commercial nations, on which no comments are nece&s;&s;ary. From a review of the whole of it, it will be found to contain the mo&s;t extraordinary collection of errors, &s;elf-contradictions, and unfounded accu&s;ations, that ever was heard of in the annals of political declamation. The author may, indeed, be &s;aid to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his prede|ce&s;&s;ors; for it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that hi&s;tory can produce no in&s;tance, where &s;uch a ma&s;s of a&s;toni&s;hing and glaring contradictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies has been conden&s;ed into the compa&s;s of half a new&s;paper: To the merit of a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing ingenuity, in this re&s;pect, he is fairly entitled, if to no other.</P>
<P>Perhaps, it will be thought that the writer of the&s;e &s;tric|tures is a friend of Mr. Jay's. He po&s;itively denies it; he has a ve|ry &s;light per&s;onal acquaintance with Mr. Jay, and has had &s;ome per&s;onal rea&s;ons to di&s;like him.

But tho&s;e, who remember his long and faithful &s;ervices, who know his tried attachment to his country, and the integrity of his heart, ought not, without proof, to abandon him to public in|famy.

<P>GREAT events have rou&s;ed the people of America from that lethargy in which they ingloriou&s;ly repo&s;ed, and have excited an attention, mingled with anxiety, peculiarly favorable to political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. Whil&s;t that lethargy exi&s;ted, the American revolution appeared incomplete to the philo&s;o|pher, who only contemplates the effects of political innovations upon the human character. The Americans retained many of the prominent features of the Engli&s;h temper.

Whil&s;t a ve&s;tige of this character remained, enlightened patri|oti&s;m could only &s;peak in "afflicted tones." But the French revolution has diffu&s;ed a blaze of light over the American world. It has communicated a fervor, an energy, a &s;ublimity of character. It has de&s;troyed that timidity which could not gaze upon the divine a&s;pect of liberty, which appointed a high prie&s;t to that "immortal daughter of rea&s;on," and which of|fered homage to her, only through the medium of flattery to him.</P>

<HEAD>Defence of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 34.]</P>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>No. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is provided by the tenth article of the treaty, that "nei|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> due from individuals of one nation to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares, nor monies, which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war, or national difference, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated; it being unju&s;t and impolitic, that debts and en|gagements, contracted and made by individuals, having confi|dence in each other, and in their re&s;pective goveraments, &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed or impaired by national authority on account of national differences and di&s;contents."</P>
<P>The virulence with which this article has been attacked, can|not fail to excite very painful &s;en&s;ations in every mind duly im|pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;anctity of public faith, and with the import|ance of national credit and character; at the &s;ame time that it furni&s;hes the mo&s;t cogent rea&s;ons to de&s;ire, that the pre&s;ervation of peace may obviate the pretext and the tempration to fully the honor, and wound the intere&s;ts of the country, by a mea&s;urs which the truly enlightened of every nation would condemn.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, without re&s;erve, that in proportion to the ve|hemence of the oppo&s;ition again&s;t this part of the treaty, is the &s;atisfaction I derive from its exi&s;tence, as an ob&s;tacle the more to the perpetration of a thing, which, in my opimon, be&s;ides deeply injuring our real and permanent intere&s;t, would cover us with ignominy. No powers of language, at my command, can expre&s;s the abhorrence I feel at the idea of violating the pro|perty of individuals, which, in an authorized intercour&s;e in time of peace, has been confided to the faith of our govern|ment and laws, on account of controver&s;ies between nation and nation. In my view, every moral and every political &s;entiment unite to con&s;ign it to execration.</P>
<P>Neither will I diffemble, that the dread of the effects of the &s;pirit which patronizes that idea, has ever been with me one of the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive arguments for a pacific policy on the part of the United States. Serious as the evil of war has appeared, at the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our affairs, the manner in which it was to be apprehended it might be carried on, was &s;till more formida|ble, in my eyes, than the thing it&s;elf. It was to be feared, that in the fermentation of certain wild opinions, tho&s;e wi&s;e, ju&s;t,
<PB N="177" REF="028389_0464_0FD8EBCEC75647D8">and temperate maxims, which will for ever con&s;titute the true &s;ecurity and felicity of a &s;tate, would be overruled; and that a war upon credit, eventually upon property, and upon the gene|ral principles of public order, might aggravate and embitter the ordinary calamities of foreign war. The confi&s;cation of debts due to the enemy, might have been the fir&s;t &s;tep of this de&s;truc|tive proce&s;s. From one violation of ju&s;tice to another, the pa&s;|&s;age is ea&s;y. Inva&s;ions of right, &s;till more fatal to credit, might have followed; and this, by extingui&s;hing the re&s;ources which that could have afforded, might have paved the way to more comprehen&s;ive and more enormous depredations for a &s;ub&s;titute. Terrible examples were before us; and there were too many not &s;ufficiently remote from a di&s;po&s;ition to admire and imitate them.</P>
<P>The earne&s;t and exten&s;ive clamours again&s;t the part of the treaty under con&s;ideration, confirm that anticipation; and whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e they enhance the merit of the provi&s;ion, they al&s;o in&s;pire a wi&s;h, that &s;ome more effectual barrier had been erected again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of a contrary practice being ever, at any ill-fated moment, obtruded upon our public councils. It would have been an ine&s;timable gem in our national con&s;titution, had it contained a po&s;itive prohibition again&s;t &s;uch a practice, except, perhaps, by way of repri&s;al for the identical injury on the part of another nation.</P>
<P>Analogous to this is that liberal and excellent provi&s;ion, in the Briti&s;h Magna Charta, which declares, that "if the mer|chants of a country at war with England, are found there in the beginning of the war, they &s;hall be attached without harm of body or <HI>effects,</HI> until it is known in what manner Engli&s;h merchants are treated in the enemy's country; and if they are &s;afe, that the foreign merchants &s;hall al&s;o be &s;afe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si Mercatores &s;int de terra contra nos guerrira, et tales inveniantur in terra no&s;tra in principio guerr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, attachientur &s;ine damno corporum &s;uorum vel <HI>reru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> donec &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iatur a nobis vel a capitali ju&s;ticiario no&s;tro quo modo mercatores terrae no&s;trae tractantur qui tune inveniantur in terra illa contra nos guerirra; et &s;i no&s;tri &s;alvi &s;int ibi, alii &s;alvi &s;int in terra no&s;tra. Magna charta, cap. XXX.</NOTE> The learn|ed Lord Coke pronounces this to be <HI>jus belli</HI> or law of war:&mdash; And the elegant and the enlightened Monte&s;quieu, &s;peaking of the &s;ame provi&s;ion, breaks out into this exclamation&mdash;"It is noble that the Engli&s;h nation have made this one of the arti|cles of its liberty."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spirit of Laws, book XX. chap. XIV.</NOTE> How much it is to be regretted, that our mag|na charta is not unequivocally decorated with a like feature; and that, in this in&s;tance, we, who have given &s;o many &s;plendid
<PB N="178" REF="028389_0465_0FD8EBD3C2647510">examples to mankind, are excelled in con&s;titutional precaution for the maintenance of ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>There is, indeed, ground to a&s;&s;ert, that the contrary principle would be repugnant to that article of our con&s;titution, which provides, that "no &s;tate &s;hall pa&s;s any law impairing the obli|gation of contracts." The &s;pirit of this clau&s;e, though the let|ter of it be re&s;tricted to the &s;tates individually, mu&s;t, on fair con&s;truction, be con&s;idered as a rule for the United States; and if &s;o, could not ea&s;ily be reconciled with the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts in time of war. But it is a pity, that &s;o important a principle &s;hould have been left to inference and implication, and &s;hould not have received an expre&s;s and direct &s;anction.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition mu&s;t appear a frightful here&s;y in the eyes of tho&s;e who repre&s;ent the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of debts, as our be&s;t means of retaliation, and coercion, as our mo&s;t powerful, &s;ometimes as our only means of defence.</P>
<P>But &s;o degrading an idea will be rejected with di&s;dain, by every man who feels a true and well informed national pride; by every man who recollects and glories, that in a &s;tate of &s;till greater immaturity, we atchieved independence without the aid of this di&s;honorable expedient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The federal government never re&s;orted to it; and a few only of the &s;tate governments &s;tained them&s;elves with it. It may, perhaps, be &s;aid, that the federal government had no power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ubject; but the rever&s;e of this is truly the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e.

This po&s;ition is fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ground that the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of the debts of an enemy is a high act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> war, nece&s;&s;arily and exclu&s;ively incident to the power of making war, which was always in the &s;ederal government.</NOTE>; that even in a revoluti|onary war, a war of liberty again&s;t u&s;urpation, our national councils were too magnanimous to be provoked or tempted to depart &s;o widely from the path of rectitude; by every man, in fine, who, though careful not to exaggerate, for ra&s;h and extra|vagant projects, can neverthele&s;s fairly e&s;timate, the real re|&s;ources of the country, for meeting dangers which prudence cannot avert.</P>
<P>Such a man will never endure the ba&s;e doctrine, that our &s;ecurity is to depend on the tricks of a &s;windler. He will look for it in the courage and con&s;tancy of a free, brave and virtuous people&mdash;in the riches of a fertile &s;oil&mdash;an extended and progre&s;&s;ive indu&s;try&mdash;in the wi&s;dom and energy of a well|con&s;tituted and well-admini&s;tered government&mdash;in the re&s;ources of a &s;olid, if well &s;upported, national credit&mdash;in the armies, which, if requi&s;ite, could be rai&s;ed&mdash;in the means of maritime
<PB N="179" REF="028389_0466_0FD8EBD4CB3EE418">annoyance, which, if nece&s;&s;ary, could be organized, and with which we could inflict deep wounds on the commerce of a ho&s;tile nation. He will indulge an animating con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that, while our &s;ituation is not &s;uch as to ju&s;tify our courting impradent enterpri&s;es, neither is it &s;uch as to oblige us, in any event, to &s;toop to di&s;honorable means of &s;ecurity, or to &s;ub&s;titute a crooked and piratical policy, for the manly energies of fair and open war.</P>
<P>That is the con&s;equence of the favorite doctrine, that the confi&s;eation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts is our mo&s;t pow|erful, if not our only, weapon of defence! Great Britain is the &s;ole power again&s;t whom we could wield it, &s;ince it is to her citizens alone, that we are largely indebted. What are we to do, then, again&s;t any other nation which might think &s;it to menace us? Are we, for want of adequate means of de&s;ence, to crouch beneath the uplifted rod, and, with abject de&s;pon|dency, &s;ue for mercy? Or has providence guaranteed us &s;pe|cially again&s;t the malice or ambition of every power on earth, except Great Britain?</P>
<P>It is at once curious and in&s;tructive to mark the incon&s;i&s;ten|cies of the di&s;organizing &s;ect. Is the que&s;tion, to di&s;card a &s;pirit of accommodation, and ru&s;h into war with Great Bri|tain? Columus are filled with the mo&s;t ab&s;urd exaggerations, to prove that we are able to meet her, not only on equal, but &s;u|perior terms.&mdash;Is the que&s;tion, whether a &s;tipulation again&s;t the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts ought to have been admitted into the treaty? Then are we a people de&s;titute of the means of war, with neither arms, nor fleets, nor ma|gazines&mdash; then is our be&s;t, if not our only weapons of defence, the power of confi&s;cating or &s;eque&s;trating the debts which are due to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain; in other words, the power of committing fraud, of violating the public faith, of &s;acrificing the principles of commerce, of pro&s;trating credit. Is the que&s;tion, whether free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, whe|ther naval &s;tores &s;hall or &s;hall not be deemed contraband? Then is the appeal to what is called the <HI>modern</HI> law of nations; then is the cry, that recent u&s;age has changed and mitigated the rigour of ancient maxims. But is the que&s;tion, whether private debts can be rightfully confi&s;cated or &s;eque&s;tered? Then ought the utmo&s;t rigour of the ancient doctrine to govern, and modern u&s;age and opinion to be di&s;carded. The old rule or the new is to be adopted or rejected, ju&s;t as may &s;uit their convenience.</P>
<P>An incon&s;i&s;tency of another kind, but not le&s;s curious, is ob&s;ervable in po&s;itions, repeatedly heard from the &s;ame quarter,
<PB N="180" REF="028389_0467_0FD8EBD65150B958">namely, that the &s;eque&s;tration of debts is the only peaceable mean of doing our&s;elves ju&s;tice and avoiding war. If we trace the origin of the pretended right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter debts, we find it, in the very authority, principally relied on to prove it, to be this (Bynker&s;hoeck, quae&s;tiones juris publici. 1. &s;. 2.) "&s;ince it is the <HI>condition</HI> of WAR, that ENEMIES may be deprived of all their rights, it is rea&s;onable, that every thing of an enemy's, found among his enemies, &s;hould change its owner, and go to the trea&s;ury." Hence it is manife&s;t, that the right it&s;elf, if it exi&s;t, pre-&s;uppo&s;es, as the <HI>condition</HI> of its exerci&s;e, an <HI>actual &s;tate of war,</HI> the <HI>relation of enemy to enemy.</HI> Yet we are fa&s;tidiou&s;ly and hypocritically told, that this high and explicit act of war, is a peaceable mean of doing our&s;elves ju&s;tice and avoiding war. Why ae we thus told? Why is this &s;trange paradox attempted to be impo&s;ed upon us! Why, but that it is the policy of the con&s;pirators again&s;t our peace, to endeavour to di&s;gui&s;e the ho&s;tilities, into which they wi&s;h to plunge us, with a &s;pecious out&s;ide, and to precipitate us down the precipice of war, while we imagine we are quietly and &s;e|curely walking along its &s;ummit.</P>
<P>Away with the&s;e ab&s;urd and incongruous &s;ophi&s;ms! Blu&s;h, ye apo&s;tles of temerity, of meanne&s;s, and of deception! Cea&s;e to beckon us to war, and at the &s;ame time to freeze our cour|age by the cowardly declaration, that we have no re&s;ource but in fraud! Cea&s;e to attempt to per&s;uade us, that peace may be obtained by means which are unequivocal acts of war. Cea&s;e to tell us, that war is preferable to di&s;honor, and yet, as our fir&s;t &s;tep, to urge us into irretrievable di&s;honor. A magnani|mous, a &s;en&s;ibre people, cannot li&s;ten to your crude concepti|ons &mdash;Why will ye per&s;evere in accumulating ridicule and con|tempt upon your own heads?</P>
<P>In the further ob&s;ervations, which I &s;hall offer on this arti|cle, I hope to &s;atisfy, not the determined leaders or in&s;truments of faction, but all di&s;cerning men, all good citizens, that, in|&s;tead of being a blemi&s;h, it is an ornament to the in&s;trument in which it is contained; that it is as con&s;i&s;tent with true poli|cy as with &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice; that it is, in &s;ub&s;tance, not without precedent in our other treaties; and that the objections to it are futile.</P>

This la&s;t circum&s;tance merits attention, becau&s;e it marks the true boundary.</P>
<P>The propriety of the &s;tipulation will be examined under the&s;e &s;everal a&s;pects: the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;trate private debts or private property in public funds, on the ground of rea&s;on and principle&mdash;the right as depending on the opinions of juri&s;ts and on u&s;age&mdash;the policy and expediency of the prac|tice &mdash;the analogy of the &s;tipulation with &s;tipulations in our other treaties, and in treaties between other nations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to the right on the ground of rea&s;on and principle.</P>
<P>The general propo&s;ition on which it is &s;upported, is this, "That every individual of a nation, with whom we are at war, where&s;oever he may be, is our enemy, and his property of eve|ry kind, in every place, liable to capture by right of war."</P>
<P>The only exception admitted to this rule, re&s;pects property within the juri&s;diction of a neutral &s;tate; but the exemption is referred to the right of the neutral nation, not to any privi|lege which the &s;ituation gives to the enemy proprietor.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, if con&s;ulted, will &s;ugge&s;t another exception&mdash;This regards all &s;uch property as the laws of a country permit foreign|ers to acquire within it or to bring into it. The right of hold|ing or having property in a country, always implies a duty on the part of its government to protect that property, and &s;ecure to the owner the full enjoyment of it. Whenever, therefore, a government grants permi&s;&s;ion to foreigners to acquire proper|ty within its territories, or to bring and depo&s;it it there, it ta|citly promi&s;es protection and &s;ecurity. It mu&s;t be under&s;tood to engage, that the foreign proprietor, as to what he &s;hall have acquired or depo&s;ited, &s;hall enjoy the rights, privileges and immunities of a native proprietor, without any other excepti|ons than tho&s;e which the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws may have previou&s;ly declared. How can any thing el&s;e be under&s;tood? Every &s;tate, when it has entered into no contrary engagement, is free to permit or not to permit foreigners to acquire or bring property
<PB N="182" REF="028389_0469_0FD8EBDE9ADBA410">within its juri&s;diction; but if it grant the right, what is there to make the tenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the foreigner different from that of the native, if antecedent laws have not pronounced a difference? Property, as it exits in civilized &s;ociety, if not a creature of, is, at lea&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and defined by, the laws. They pre&s;cribe the manner in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be u&s;ed, alienated, or tran&s;mitted; the conditions on which it may be help, pre&s;erved, or forfeited. It is to them we are to look for its rights, limitations, and con|ditions. No condition of enjoyment, no cau&s;e of forfeiture, which they have not &s;pecified, can be pre&s;umed to exi&s;t. An extraordinary di&s;cretion to re&s;ume or take away the thing, with|out any per&s;onal fault of the proprietor, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of property. This &s;eems always to imply a contract between the &s;ociety and the individual; that he &s;hall retain and be protected in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of his property, &s;o long as he &s;hall ob&s;erve and perform the conditions which the laws have annexed to the tenure. It is neither natural nor equitable to con&s;ider him as &s;ubject to be deprived of it, for a cau&s;e &s;o|reign to him&s;elf: &s;till le&s;s for one which may depend on the volition or plea&s;ure, even of the very government to who&s;e pro|tection it has been confided: for the propo&s;ition, which af|firms the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter, does not di&s;tingui&s;h between offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive war; between a war of ambition on the part of the power which exerci&s;es the right, or a war of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of another.</P>
<P>The property of a foreigner placed in another country, by permi&s;&s;ion of its laws, may ju&s;tly be regarded as a depo&s;it, of which the &s;ociety is the tru&s;tee. How can it be reconciled with the idea of a tru&s;t, to take the property from its owner, when he has per&s;onally given no cau&s;e for the deprivation?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e two families in a &s;tate of nature, and that a mem|ber of one of them had by permi&s;&s;ion of the head of the other, placed in his cu&s;tody &s;ome article belonging to him&s;elf&mdash;and &s;uppo&s;e a quarrel to en&s;ue between the two heads of families, in which the member had not participated by his immediate coun&s;el or con&s;ent&mdash;would not natural equity declare the &s;eizure and confi&s;cation of the depo&s;ited property to be an act of per|fidious rapacity?</P>
<P>Again&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e two neighbouring nations, which had not had intercour&s;e with each other, and one of them opens its ports and territories for the purpo&s;e of commerce, to the citi|zens of the other, proclaiming free and &s;afe ingre&s;s and egre&s;s &mdash;&s;uppo&s;e afterwards a war to break out between the two na|tions, and the one which had granted that permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;eize and convert to its own u&s;e, the goods and credits of the mer|chants
<PB N="183" REF="028389_0470_0FD8EBE013AEDD38">of the other, within its dominion. What &s;entence would natural rea&s;on, unwarped by particular dogmas, pro|nounce on &s;uch conduct? If we ab&s;tract our&s;elves from extra|neous impre&s;&s;ions, and con&s;ult a moral feeling, we &s;hall not doubt that the &s;entence would inflict all the opprobium and in|famy of violated faith.</P>
<P>Nor can we di&s;tingu&s;h either ca&s;e, in principle, from that which con&s;tantly takes place between nations, that permit a commercial intercour&s;e with each other, whether with or with|out national compact. They equally grant a right to bring in|to and carry out of their territories the property which is the &s;ubject of the intercour&s;e, a right of free and &s;ecure ingre&s;s and egre&s;s; and in doing this, they make their territories a &s;anctuary or a&s;ylum, which ought to be inviolable, and which the &s;pirit of plunder only could have ever violated.</P>
<P>There is no parity between the ca&s;e of the per&s;ons and goods of enemies found in our own country, and that of the per&s;ons and goods of enemies found el&s;ewhere. In the former there is a reliance upon our ho&s;pitality and ju&s;tice; there is an expre&s;s or implied &s;afe conduct; the individuals and their property are in the cu&s;tody of our faith: they have no power to re&s;i&s;t our will; they can lawfully make no defence again&s;t our vio|lence; they are deemed to owe a temporary allegiance; and for endeavouring re&s;i&s;tance, would be puni&s;hed as criminals; a character incon&s;i&s;tent with that of an enemy. To make them a prey, is, therefore, to infringe every rule of genero&s;ity and equity; it is to add cowardice to treachery. In the latter ca&s;e, there is no confidence whatever repo&s;ed in us; no claim upon our ho&s;pitality, ju&s;tice or good faith; there is the &s;imple cha|racter of enemy, with entire liberty to oppo&s;e force to force. The right of war con&s;equently to attack and &s;eize, whether to obtain indemnification for any injury received&mdash;to di&s;able our enemy from doing us further harm&mdash;to force him to rea&s;onable terms of accommodation&mdash;or to repre&s;s an overbearing ambition, ex|i&s;ts in full vigour, unre&s;trained and unqualified by any tru&s;t or duty on our part. In pur&s;uing it, though we may inflict hard|&s;hip, we do not commit inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Moreover the property of the foreigner within our country, may be regarded as having paid a valuable con&s;ideration for its protection and exemption from forfeiture; that which is brought in, commonly enriches the revenue by a duty of entry. All that is within our territory, whether acquired there or brought there, is liable to contributions to the trea&s;ury, in common with other &s;imilar property. Does there not re&s;ult an obliga|tion to protect that which comtributes to the expen&s;e of its

<P>The principle of the propo&s;ition gives an equal right to &s;ub|ject the per&s;on as the property of the foreigner to the rigors of war. But what would be thought of a government which &s;hould &s;eize all the &s;ubjects of its enemy found within its territory, and commit them to durance, as pri&s;oners of war? Would not all agree that it had violated an a&s;ylum which ought to have been &s;acred? That it had trampled upon the laws of ho&s;pitality and civilization? That it had di&s;graced it&s;elf by an act of cru|elty and barbari&s;m?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All that can rightfully be done, is to oblige the foreigners, who are &s;ubjects of our enemy, to quit our country.</NOTE> Why would it not be equally reprehen&s;i|ble to violate the a&s;ylum which had been given to the property of tho&s;e foreigners?</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, left to its own lights, would an&s;wer all the&s;e que&s;ti|ons in one way, and &s;everely condemn the mole&s;tation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of a national conte&s;t, as well of the property as per|&s;on of a foreigner found in our country, under the licen&s;e and guarantee of the laws of previous amity.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of property in the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is &s;till &s;tronger th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that of private debts. To all the &s;anctions which apply to the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, it adds that of an expre&s;s pledge of the public &s;aith to the foreign holder of &s;tock.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituting of a public debt or fund, trans&s;erable with|out limitation or di&s;tinction, amounts to a promi&s;e to all the world, that whoever, foreigner or citizen, may acquire a title to it, &s;hall enjoy the benefit of what is &s;tipulated. Every trans|feree becomes, by the act of transfer, the immediate proprie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the promi&s;e. It mures directly to his u&s;e, and the foreign promi&s;ee no more than the native, can be deprived of that be|nefit, except in con&s;equence of &s;ome act of his own, without the infraction of a po&s;itive engagement.</P>
<P>Public debt has been truly defined, <HI>"A property &s;ub&s;i&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the faith of government."</HI> Its e&s;&s;ence is promi&s;e. To confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter it is emphatically to re&s;cind the promi&s;e given, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> revoke the faith plighted&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the two ideas of a breach of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, and the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a property &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only in the faith of the government by which it is made.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered, that the promi&s;e made to the foreigner is not made to him in the capacity of member of another foci|ety, but in that of citizen of the world, or of an individual in
<PB N="185" REF="028389_0472_0FD8EBE658A6DA20">the &s;tate of nature&mdash;the infraction of it towards him, on ac|count of the fault, real or preteded, of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, is the more obviou&s;ly de&s;titute of colour. There is no real affinity between the motive and the con&s;equence. There is a confounding of relations. The obligation of a contract can only be avoided by the breach of a condition expre&s;s or implied, which appears or can be pre&s;umed to have been within the con|templation of both parties, or by the per&s;onal fault or crime of him to whom it is to be performed. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a citizen of one country would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end his money to the govern|ment of another, in the expectation that a war between the two countries, which, without or again&s;t their will, might break out the next day, could be deemed a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of forfeiture?</P>
<P>The principle may be te&s;ted in another way&mdash;Supppo&s;e one go|vernment indebted to another in a certain &s;um of money, and &s;uppo&s;e the creditor government to borrow of the citizen of the other an equal &s;um of money.

<P>With what greater rea&s;on could his claim be refu&s;ed on ac|count of an injury which was a cau&s;e of war, received from his &s;overeign, and which had created on the part of the &s;ove|reign a debt of reparation? It were certainly more natural and ju&s;t to &s;et off a debt due by contract to the citizen of a foreign country again&s;t a debt due by contract from the &s;overeign of that country, than to &s;et it off again&s;t a vague claim of indemni|fication for an injury or aggre&s;&s;ion of which we complain, and of which the reality or ju&s;tice is &s;eldom undi&s;puted on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The true rule which re&s;ults from what has been &s;aid, and which rea&s;on &s;anctions with regard to the right of capture, is this&mdash;"It may be exerci&s;ed every where <HI>except within a neu|tral juri&s;diction</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are exceptions to this exception; but they depend on &s;pecial circum|&s;tances, which admit the principal exception, and need not be particularized.</NOTE><HI>or where the property is under the protection of our own laws;</HI>" and it may perhaps be added that it always &s;up|po&s;es the po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>rightful</HI> combat, of attack, and defence.</P>

<P>THE point next to be examined is the right of confi&s;ca|tion or &s;eque&s;tration, as depending on the opinions of ju|ri&s;ts and on u&s;age.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand how far the&s;e ought to weigh, it is requi&s;ite to con&s;ider what are the elements or ingredients, which compo&s;e what is called the law of nations.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituent parts of this &s;y&s;tem are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> or internal law, which is the <HI>law of nature</HI> applied to nations; or that &s;y&s;tem of rules for regulating the conduct of nation to nation, which rea&s;on deduces from the principles of natural right, as relative to political &s;ocieties or &s;tates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>voluntary</HI> law, which is a &s;y&s;tem of rules re&s;ulting from the equality and independence of nations, and which, in the admini&s;tration of their affairs, and the pur&s;uit of their preten&s;ions, proceeding on the principle of their having no common judge upon earth, attributes equal validity, as to external effects, to the mea&s;ures or conduct of one as of another, without regard to the intrin|&s;ic ju&s;tice of tho&s;e mea&s;ures or that conduct. Thus captures, in war, are as valid, when made by the party in the wrong, as by the party in the right.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>pactitious</HI> or <HI>conventional</HI> law, or that law which re&s;ults from a treaty between two or more nations. This is evidently a particular, not a general law, &s;ince a treaty or pact can only bind the contracting parties: Yet, when we find a provi&s;ion univer&s;ally pervading the trea|ties between nations, for a length of time, as a kind of for|mula, it is high evidence of the general law of nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The cu&s;tomary law, which con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e rules of conduct, that, in practice, are re&s;pected and ob&s;erved among nations: Its authority depends on u&s;age, implying a tacit con&s;ent and agreement. This al&s;o is a particular, not a general law, obli|gatory
<PB N="187" REF="028389_0474_0FD8EBEB8CDB59F0">only on tho&s;e nations who&s;e acquie&s;cence has appeared, or, from circum&s;tances, may fairly be pre&s;umed. Thus, the cu&s;tomary law of Europe may not be that of a different quarter of the globe. The three la&s;t branches are &s;ometimes aggregately denominated the <HI>po&s;itive</HI> law of nations.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The two fir&s;t are di&s;coverable by rea&s;on; the two la&s;t de|pend on proof, as matters of fact. Hence the opinion of ju|ri&s;ts, though weighing, as the &s;entiments of judicious or learned men, who have made the &s;ubject a particular &s;tudy, are not conclu&s;ive, as authorities.&mdash;In regard to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> law, e&s;pecially, they may be freely di&s;regarded, unle&s;s they are found to be adopted and &s;anctioned by the prac|tice of nations: For where REASON is the guide, it cannot properly be renounced for mere OPINION, however re&s;pectable. As witne&s;&s;es of the cu&s;tomary laws, their te&s;timony, the re|&s;ult of careful re&s;earches, is more particularly entitled to at|tention.</P>
<P>If, then, it has been &s;atisfactorily proved, as the dictate of &s;ound rea&s;on, that private debts, and private property in public funds, are not ju&s;tly liable to confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration, an op|po&s;ite opinion of one or more juri&s;ts could not controul the con|clu&s;ion in point of principle. So far as it may atte&s;t a practice of nations, which may have introduced a po&s;itive law on the &s;ub|ject, the con&s;ideration may be different. It will then remain to examine, upon their own and other te&s;timony, whether that practice be &s;o general as to be capable of varying a rule of rea|&s;on, by the force of u&s;age; and whether it &s;till continues to bear the &s;ame character, or has been weakened or done away by &s;ome recent or more modern u&s;age.</P>
<P>I will not avail my&s;elf of a po&s;ition, advanced by &s;ome writers, that u&s;age, if derogating from the principles of natu|ral ju&s;tice, is null, further than to draw this inference, that a rule of right, deducible from them, cannot be deemed to be al|tered by u&s;age, partially contradicted, fluctuating.</P>
<P>With the&s;e guides, our further enquiries will &s;erve to confirm us in the negative of the pretended right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;|ter in the ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The notion of this right is evidently derived from the ROMAN law. It is &s;een there, in this peculiar form, "Tho&s;e things of an enemy which are among us, belong not to the &s;tate, but to the fir&s;t occupant,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dige&s;t. XLI. tit. 1.

<PB N="188" REF="028389_0475_0FD8EBECC9E9B070">who fir&s;t gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is known, that the maxims of the Roman law are exten&s;ively incorporated into the different codes of Europe; and particularly, that the writers on the law of nations have borrowed liberally from them. This &s;ource of the notion does not &s;tamp it with much authority. The hi&s;tory of Rome proves, that war and conque&s;t were the great bu&s;ine&s;s of that people, and that, for the mo&s;t part, commerce was little cultivated. Hence it was natural, that the rights of war &s;hould be carried to an extreme, unmitigated by the &s;oft|ening and humanizing influence of commerce. Indeed the world was yet too young&mdash;moral &s;cience too much in its cradle &mdash;to render the Roman juri&s;prudence a proper model for im|plicit imitation: accordingly, in this very particular of the rights of war, it &s;eems to have been equally a rule of the Roman law, "That tho&s;e who go into a foreign country, in time of peace, if war is &s;uddenly kindled, are made the &s;laves of tho&s;e among whom, now become enemies by ill fortune, they are apprehended."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ubito exarci&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> um &s;ervi effi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> jam ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uo facto depre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nduntur."

<P>The improvement of moral &s;cience in modern times, re|&s;trains the right of killing an enemy to the time of battle or re&s;i&s;tance, except by way of puni&s;hment for &s;ome enormous breach of the law of nations, or for &s;elf pre&s;ervation, in ca&s;e of immediate and urgent danger; and rejects altogether the right of impo&s;ing &s;lavery on captives.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould there have been a he&s;itation to reject other odi|ous con&s;equences of &s;o exceptionable a principle? What re&s;pect is due to maxims which have &s;o inhuman a foundation?</P>
<P>And yet a deference for tho&s;e maxims has mi&s;led writers who have profe&s;&s;edly undertaken to teach the principles of national ethics; and the &s;pirit of rapine has continued, to a late period, to con&s;ecrate the relics of ancient barbari&s;m with too many precedents of imitation&mdash;El&s;e it would not now be a que&s;tion with any, "Whether the per&s;on or property of a foreigner, being in our country with permi&s;&s;ion of the laws of peace,

<P>Turning from the ancients to the moderns, we find, that the learned Grotius quotes and adopts, as the ba&s;is of his opi|nions, the rules of the Roman law; though he, in &s;everal par|ticulars, qualifies them, by the humane innovations of later times.</P>
<P>On the very que&s;tion of the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter pri|vate debts, his opinion, as far as it appears, &s;eems to be at variance with his premi&s;es, &s;teering a kind of middle cour&s;e. His expre&s;&s;ions (L. III. C. XX. Sec. XVI.) are the&s;e, "Tho&s;e debts which are due to private per&s;ons, at the beginning of the war, are not to be accounted forgiven (that is, when peace is made) for the&s;e are not acquired by the right of war, but only <HI>forbidden to be demanded</HI> in time of war; therefore, the <HI>impediment</HI> being removed, that is, the war ended, they retain their full force." His idea appears from this pa&s;&s;age to be, that that the right of war is limited to the arre&s;ting of the payment of private debts during its continuance, and not to the confi&s;|cation or annihilation of the debt. Nor is it clear, whether he means, that this arre&s;tation is to be produced by a &s;pecial act of prohibition, or by the operation of &s;ome rule of law, which denies to an alien enemy a right of action. This feeble and heterogeneous opinion may be conceived to have proceeded from a conflict between a re&s;pect for ancient maxims, and the impre&s;&s;ion of more enlightened views, inculcated by the princi|ples of commerce and civilization.</P>
<P>Bynker&s;hoeck is more con&s;i&s;tent: Adopting, with Grotius, the rule of the Roman law in its full vigour, he is not fright|ened at the con&s;equences, but follows them throughout. Hence he be&s;tows a chapter upon the defence of the propo&s;ition, quoted in a former number (to wit) that,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quae&s;tionum Juris Public. libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I. caput VII.

<P>In confirmation of his doctrine, he adduces a variety of ex|amples, which embrace a period of &s;omething more than a century, beginning in the year 1556, and ending in the year 1657, and which comprehends, as actors on the principle which
<PB N="190" REF="028389_0477_0FD8EB038CEBE838">he e&s;pou&s;es, France, Spain, the States General, Denmark, the bi&s;hops of Cologne, and Mun&s;ter. But he acknowledges that the right has been que&s;tioned; and notes particularly, that when the king of France and the bi&s;hops of Mun&s;ter and Co|logne, in the year 1563, confi&s;cated the debts which their &s;ub|jects owed to the confederate Belgians, the &s;tates general, by an edict of the 6th of July, of that year, cen&s;ured the proceed|ing, and decreed that tho&s;e debts could not be paid but to the true creditors, and that the exaction of them, whether by force or with con&s;ent, was not to be e&s;teemed valid.</P>
<P>If from the great pains which appear to have been taken by this learned writer, to collect examples in proof of his doctrine, we are to conclude that the collection is tolerably complete, we are warranted in drawing this inference, that he has not cured any defect, which rea&s;on may di&s;cern in his principle, by any thing like the evidence of &s;uch a general, uniform, and continued u&s;age, as is requi&s;ite to introduce <HI>a rule</HI> of the po&s;i|tive law of nations, in derogation from the natural.</P>
<P>A minority only of the powers of Europe are &s;hown to have been implicated in the practice; and among the majority, not included, are &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and re&s;pectable. One of the&s;e, Great Britain, is repre&s;ented as having acqui|e&s;ced in it, in the treaties of peace, between her and &s;ome of the powers who went into the practice, to her detriment, by relinqui&s;hing the claim of re&s;titution&mdash;But war mu&s;t, at length, end in peace; and the &s;acrifice a nation makes to the latter, is a &s;light argument of her con&s;ent to the principle of the injuries which &s;he may have &s;u&s;tained. I have not been able to trace a &s;ingle in&s;tance in which Great Britain has, her&s;elf, &s;et the ex|ample of &s;uch a practice; nor could &s;he do it, as has el&s;ewhere appeared, without contravening an article of magna charta, un|le&s;s by way of repri&s;al for the &s;ame thing done towards her. The &s;ugge&s;tion of an in&s;tance in the pre&s;ent war with France, will, hereafter, be examined. In &s;uch a que&s;tion, the practice of a nation, which has, for ages, figured pre-eminently in the commercial world, is entitled to particular notice.</P>
<P>It is not unworthy of remark, that the common law of Eng|land, from its earlie&s;t dawnings, contradicted the rule of the Roman law. It exempted from &s;eizure, by a &s;ubject of Eng|land, the property of a foreigner brought there before a war; but gave to the fir&s;t &s;eizer, or occupant, the property which came there after the breaking out of a war. The noble prin|ciples of the common law cannot cea&s;e to engage our re&s;pect, while we have before our eyes &s;o many monuments of their excellence in our own juri&s;diction.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="028389_0478_0FD8EBF8277C42D8">
It al&s;o merits to be dwelt upon, that the United Netherlands, for &s;ome time the fir&s;t, and long only the &s;econd in commerci|al con&s;equence, formally di&s;puted the right, and condemned the practice of confi&s;cating private debts, though them&s;elves, in &s;ome in&s;tances, guilty of it.</P>
<P>And it is likewi&s;e a material circum&s;tance, that Bynker|&s;hoeck, who &s;eems to have written in the year 1737, does not adduce any precedent later than the year 1667, &s;eventy years before his publication.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent period will, it is believed, be found upon &s;trict enquiry, equally barren of &s;imilar precedents. The ex|ceptions are &s;o few,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e of Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and the Sile&s;ia loan, is the only one I have found.</NOTE> that we may fairly a&s;&s;ert, that there is the negative u&s;age of near a century and an half, again&s;t the pre|tended right. This negative u&s;age, of a period, the mo&s;t en|lightened as well as the mo&s;t commercial in the annals of the world, is of the highe&s;t authority. The former u&s;age, as be|ing partial and with numerous exceptions, was in&s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule.&mdash;The contrary u&s;age, or the renunciation of the former u&s;age, as being general, as attended with few or no exceptions, is &s;ufficient even to work a change in the rigour of an ancient rule, if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. Much more is it &s;ufficient to confirm and enforce the le&s;|&s;on of rea&s;on, and to di&s;&s;ipate the clouds which error, and &s;ome &s;cattered in&s;tances of violence and rapine, may have pro|duced.</P>
<P>Of the theoretical writers, whom I had an opportunity of con&s;ulting, Vattel is the only remaining one, who directly treats the point. His opinion has been &s;aid to favor the right to con|fi&s;cate and &s;eque&s;ter. But when carefully analized, it will add to the proofs of the levity with which the oppo&s;ers of the treaty make a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>After &s;tating, among other things, that "war gives the &s;ame right over any &s;um of money due by a neutral nation to our enemy, as it can give over his other goods," he proceeds thus &mdash;"When Alexander, by conque&s;t, became ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Thebes, he remitted to the The&s;&s;alians, a hundred talents, which they owed to the Thebans. The &s;overeign has naturally the &s;ame right over what his &s;ubjects may be indebted to his ene|mies; therefore he may confi&s;cate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of war; or, at lea&s;t, he may prohibit his &s;ubjects from paying, while the war la&s;ts. But at pre&s;ent, in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe have departed from this rigour.
<PB N="192" REF="028389_0479_0FD8EBFBD34EFE40">And as this cu&s;tom has been generally received, he who &s;hould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for &s;trangers tru&s;ted his &s;ubjects only from a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that the gene|ral cu&s;tom would be ob&s;erved. The &s;tate does not &s;o much as touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in ca&s;e of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book III. Chap. 5. &s;ect. 77.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fir&s;t propo&s;ition of the above pa&s;&s;age, amounts to this, that "a &s;overeign <HI>naturally,</HI> that is, according to the law of nature, may confi&s;cate debts, which his &s;ubjects owe to his enemies, if the term of payment happen in the time of war; or, at lea&s;t, he may prohibit his &s;ubjects from paying while the war la&s;ts."</P>
<P>So far as this goes, it agrees with the principle which I com|bat, that there is a natural right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter pri|vate debts in time of war; &s;o far Vattel accords with the Ro|man law and with Bynker&s;hoek.</P>
<P>But he annexes a whim&s;ical limitation, "If the term of pay|ment happen in the time of war"&mdash;and there is a marked un|certainty and he&s;itation&mdash;the &s;overeign "may confi&s;cate, or, at lea&s;t, he may prohibit his &s;ubjects from paying while the war la&s;ts." It is evident, that the circum&s;tance of the time of pay|ment can have no influence upon the right. If it reaches to confi&s;cation, which takes away the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing, the mere incident of the happening of payment mu&s;t be immaterial. If it is confined to the arre&s;ting of payment during the war, the rea&s;on of the rule, the object being to prevent &s;upplies going to the enemy, will apply it as well to debts which had become payable before the war, as to tho&s;e which became pay|able in the war. Whence this inaccuracy in &s;o accurate a thinker? Whence the he&s;itation about &s;o important a point, as whether the pretended right extends to confi&s;cation or &s;imply to &s;eque&s;tration? They mu&s;t be accounted for, as in another ca&s;e, by the conflict between re&s;pect for ancient maxims and the impre&s;&s;ions of ju&s;ter views, &s;econded by the more enlight|ened policy of modern times.</P>
<P>But while Vattel thus countenances, in the fir&s;t part of the pa&s;&s;age, the opinion, that the natural law of nations authorizes the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts, in what im|mediately follows, he mo&s;t explicitly and unequivocally informs us, that the rule of that law in this re&s;pect has been abrogated by modern u&s;age or cu&s;tom; in other words, that the modern cu&s;tomary law has changed in this particular the ancient natu|ral
<PB N="193" REF="028389_0480_0FD8EBFCDA30BA28">law. Let his own words be con&s;ulted&mdash;"At pre&s;ent," &s;ays the, "in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe have departed from this rigour: and as this cu&s;tom has been generally received, he who would act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for &s;trangers tru&s;ted his &s;ubjects only from the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the gene|ral cu&s;tom would be ob&s;erved."</P>
<P>This te&s;timony is full, that there is a general cu&s;tom received and adopted by all the &s;overeigns of Europe, which obviates the rigour of the ancient rule; the non-ob&s;ervance of which cu&s;tom would violate the public faith of a nation; as being a breach of an implied contract, by virtue of the cu&s;tom, upon the &s;trength of which foreigners tru&s;t his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Language cannot de&s;cribe more clearly a rule of the cu&s;to|mary law of nations, the e&s;&s;ence of which, we have &s;een, is general u&s;age implying a tacit agreement to conform to the rule &mdash;The one alleged is denominated a cu&s;tom generally received, a general cu&s;tom; all the &s;overeigns of Europe are &s;tated to be parties to it, and it is repre&s;ented as obligatory on the public faith, &s;ince this would be injured by a departure from it.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence is, that if the right pretended did exi&s;t by the natural law, it has given way to the cu&s;tomary law; for it is a contradiction, to call that a right, which cannot be exerci&s;ed without breach of faith. The re&s;ult is, that by the pre&s;ent cu&s;tomary law of nations, within the &s;phere of its action, there is no right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private debts in time of war. The rea&s;on or motive of which law is the advantage and &s;afety of commerce.</P>
<P>As to private property in public funds, the right to meddle with them is &s;till more emphatically negatived.&mdash;"The &s;tate does not <HI>&s;o much as touch</HI> the &s;ums it owes to the enemy&mdash;<HI>Every where,</HI> in ca&s;e of a war, funds credited to the public are ex|empt from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure." The&s;e terms manife&s;tly exclude &s;eque&s;tration as well as confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>In another place, the author gives the rea&s;on of this po&s;ition, Book II. Chap. XVIII. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n repri&s;als, the goods of a &s;ubject are &s;eized in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the &s;tate or the &s;ove|reign. &mdash;Every thing that belongs to the nation is liable to repri|&s;als as &s;oon as it can be &s;eized, <HI>provided it be not a depo&s;ite tru&s;ted to the public faith.</HI> This DEPOSITE is found in our hands, only in con&s;equence of that <HI>confidence,</HI> which the proprietor has put in our good faith, and it ought to be re&s;pected, even in ca&s;e of open war.&mdash;Thus it is u&s;ual to behave in France, England, and el&s;ewhere, with re&s;pect to the money which foreigners have placed in the public funds." The &s;ame principle, if he had re|flected
<PB N="194" REF="028389_0481_0FD8EBFE0701DA90">without bias, would have taught him, that repri&s;als could rightfully extend to nothing that had been committed with their permi&s;&s;ion, to the cu&s;tody and guardian&s;hip of our laws, during a &s;tate of peace; and con&s;equently, that no property of our enemy, which was in our country before the breaking out of the war, is ju&s;tly liable to them. For is not all &s;uch pro|perty <HI>equally a depo&s;ite, tru&s;ted to the public faith?</HI> What foreigner would acquire property in our country, or bring and lodge it there, but in the <HI>confidence,</HI> that, in ca&s;e of war, it would not become an object of repri&s;als? Why then re&s;ort to cu&s;tom for a denial of the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private debts? Why not trace it to the natural inju&s;tice and perfidy of taking away in war, what a foreigner is permitted to own and have among us in peace? Why ever have con&s;idered that as a na|tural right which was contrary to good faith tacitly pledged? This is evidently the effect of too much deference to ferocious maxims of antiquity, of undue complai&s;ance to &s;ome precedents of modern rapacity.</P>
<P>He had avoided the error, by weighing maturely the con&s;e|quences of his own principle in another ca&s;e: "He who de|clares war, (&s;ays he) does not confi&s;cate the <HI>immoveable</HI> goods po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his country by his enemy's &s;ubjects: <HI>in per mitting them to purcha&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e goods,</HI> he has, in this re&s;pect, admitted them into the number of his &s;ubjects," (that is) he has admitted them to a like privilege with his &s;ubjects, as to the real property they were permitted to acquire and hold. But, why &s;hould a le&s;s privilege attend the licen&s;e to purcha&s;e, po&s;|&s;e&s;s, or have other kinds of property in his country? The rea|&s;on, which is, the permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeign, mu&s;t extend to the protection of one kind of property as well as another, if the permi&s;&s;ion extends to both.</P>
<P>Vattel advances in this and in the pa&s;&s;age quoted immediately before it, the true principles which ought to govern the que&s;tion &mdash;though he does not pur&s;ue them into their con&s;equences; el&s;e he would not have deduced the exemption of private debts, from confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration, from the cu&s;tomary law of nations, but would have traced it to the natural or nece&s;&s;ary law, as founded upon the obligations of good faith; upon the tacit promi&s;e of &s;ecurity connected with the permi&s;&s;ion to ac|quire property within, or bring property into, our country; upon the protection which every government owes to a property of which it legalizes the acqui&s;ition, or the depo&s;it within its juri&s;diction; and in ca&s;e of <HI>immoveable</HI> goods or real e&s;tate, of which he admits a right to &s;eque&s;ter the <HI>income,</HI> to prevent its being remitted to the enemy, he would have perceived the ne|ce&s;&s;aty
<PB N="195" REF="028389_0482_0FD8EBFFE0A5BA20">of leaving this effect to be produced by the ob&s;tructions intrin&s;ically incident to a &s;tate of war; &s;ince there is no rea&s;on why the income &s;hould be le&s;s privileged than the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing.</P>
<P>It appears, then, that the doctrine of Vattel, collectively taken, amounts to this, that there is a natural right of war in certain ca&s;es to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter enemy's property found within our country; but that, on motives relative to commerce and public credit, the cu&s;tomary law of Europe has re&s;trained that right, as to <HI>private debts,</HI> and <HI>private property,</HI> in public funds. His opinion, therefore, favors the principle of the arti|cle of the treaty under examination, as con&s;onant with the pre&s;ent European law of nations&mdash;and it is an opinion of greater weight than any that can be cited; as well on account of the capacity, diligence, information, and the preci&s;ion of ideas, which characteri&s;e the work in which it is contained, as on account of the recency of that work.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears to have been written about the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">60.</NOTE></P>
<P>A que&s;tion may be rai&s;ed&mdash;Does this cu&s;tomary law of nati|ons, as e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe, bind the United States? An affirmative an&s;wer to this is warranted by conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The United States, when a member of the Briti&s;h em|pire, were, in this capacity, a party to that law, and not hav|ing di&s;&s;ented from it, when they became independent, they are to be con&s;idered as having continued a party to it. 2. The com|mon law of England, which was and is in force in each of the&s;e &s;tates, adopts the law of nations, the po&s;itive equally with the natural, as a part of it&s;elf. 3. Ever &s;ince we have been an in|dependent nation, we have appealed to, and acted upon, the <HI>modern</HI> law of nations as under&s;tood in Europe&mdash;various re&s;olu|tions of congre&s;s during our revolution&mdash;the corre&s;pondencies of executive officers&mdash;the deci&s;ions of our courts of admiralty, all recognized this &s;tandard. 4. Executive and legi&s;lative acts, and the proceedings of our courts, under the pre&s;ent govern|ment, &s;peak a &s;imilar language. The pre&s;ident's proclamation of neutrality, refers expre&s;sly to the <HI>modern</HI> law of nations, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood of that prevailing in Eu|rope, and acceded to by this country; and the general voice of our nation, together with the very arguments u&s;ed again&s;t the treaty, accord in the &s;ame point. It is indubitable, that the cu&s;|tomary law of European nations is, as a part of the common law, and by adoption, that of the United States.</P>
<P>But let it not be forgotten, that I derive the vindication of the article from a higher &s;ource, from the natural or nece&s;&s;ary law
<PB N="196" REF="028389_0483_0FD8EC01682D2418">of nature&mdash;from the eternal principles of morality and good faith.</P>
<P>There is one more authority which I &s;hall cite in reference to a part of the que&s;tion; property in the public funds. It is a report to the Briti&s;h king in the year 1753, from Sir George Lee, judge of the prerogative court, Dr. Paul, advocate gene|ral in the courts of civil law, Sir Dudley Rider and Mr. Mur|ray, attorney and &s;olicitor general,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir George Lee, was afterwards the very celebrated Chief Ju&s;tice Lee, and Mr. Murray was the late Lord Mansfield.</NOTE> on the &s;ubject of the Sile&s;ia loan, &s;eque&s;tered by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by way of repri&s;al, for the capture and condemnation of &s;ome Pru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els. This report merits all the re&s;pect which can be derived from con&s;ummate knowledge and ability in the reporters; but it would lo&s;e much of its weight from the want of impartiality, which might fairly be imputed to the officers of one of the go|vernments intere&s;ted in the conte&s;t, had it not &s;ince received the confirming eulogies of impartial and celebrated foreign writers.&mdash;A mong the&s;e, Vattel calls it an excellent piece on the law of nations.</P>
<P>The following is an extract:&mdash;"The king of Pru&s;&s;ia has pledged his royal word to pay the Sile&s;ia debt to <HI>private men.</HI> It is negociable, and many parts of it have been a&s;&s;igned to the &s;ubjects of other powers. It will not be ea&s;y to <HI>find an in&s;tance,</HI> where a prince has though fit to make repri&s;als upon <HI>a debt due from him&s;elf to private men.</HI> There is a <HI>confidence that this will not be done.</HI> A private man lends money to a prince upon an <HI>engagement of honor; becau&s;e a prince cannot be compelled, like other men, in an adver&s;ary way, by a court of ju&s;tice.</HI> So &s;crupulou&s;ly did England and France adhere to this <HI>public faith,</HI> that even during the war, they &s;uffered no enquiry to be made whether any part of the public debt was due to the &s;ubjects of the enemy, though it is certain many Engli&s;h had money in the French funds, and many French had money in ours."</P>
<P>The univer&s;al obligation of good faith is here reinforced on a &s;pecial ground, by the <HI>point of honor;</HI> to confirm the po&s;ition that money which a &s;overeign or &s;tate owes to private men, is not a proper object of repri&s;als.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e of the Sile&s;ia debt is the only example, within the pre&s;ent century, prior to the exi&s;ting war, which I have been able to trace, violating the immunity of private debts, or pri|vate property, in public funds. It is a precedent that can have little weight, not only from &s;ingularity, but from the character of its author. Frederick was a con&s;ummate general, a pro|found
<PB N="197" REF="028389_0484_0FD8EC0675FF5958">&s;tate&s;man; but he was very far from being a &s;evere mo|rali&s;t. This is not the only in&s;tance in which he tarni&s;hed his &s;aith; and the friends of his &s;ame mu&s;t regret, that he could not plead on the occa&s;ion tho&s;e mighty and dazzling rea&s;ons of &s;tate, which are the &s;pecious apologies for his other aber|rations.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, that the pre&s;ent war of Europe affords exam|ples of the practice, which I reprobate, and that Great Britain her&s;elf has given one. The pre&s;ent war of Europe is of &s;o ex|traordinary a complexion, and has been conducted, in all re&s;pects, upon &s;uch extraordinary principles, that it may truly be regarded as an exception to all general rules, as a precedent for nothing. It is rather a beacon, warning mankind to &s;hun the pernicious examples, which it &s;ets, than a model inviting to imitation. The human pa&s;&s;ions, on all &s;ides, appear to have been wrought up to a pitch of frenzy, which has &s;et rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and humanity, at defiance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have neverthele&s;s thought fit to appeal to the examples of this very anomalous war, have not detailed to us the preci&s;e nature or cour&s;e of the tran&s;actions to which they refer; nor do I know that &s;ufficient documents have appeared in this country to guide us in the enquiry.</P>
<P>The imperfect evidence which has fallen under my ob&s;erva|tion, re&s;pects France and Great Britain, and &s;eems to exhibit the&s;e facts.:&mdash;</P>
<P>France pa&s;&s;ed a decree &s;eque&s;tering the property of the &s;ub|jects of the powers at war with her; and in the &s;ame or ano|ther decree, obliged all tho&s;e of her citizens, who had monies owing to them in foreign countries, to draw bills upon their debtors, and to furni&s;h tho&s;e bills to the government, by way of loan, or upon certain terms of payment.</P>
<P>The government of Great Britain, in con&s;equence of this proceeding, pa&s;&s;ed ten different acts, the objects of which were to prevent the payment of tho&s;e bills, and to &s;ecure the &s;ums due for the benefit of the original creditors. The&s;e acts appoint certain commi&s;&s;ioners, to whom reports are to be made of all French property in the hands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and who are empowered to receive and fell goods and other effects&mdash;to col|lect debts, and to depo&s;ite the proceeds in the bank of London, or in other &s;afe keeping, if preferred or required by parties intere&s;ted. The monies depo&s;ited are to be inve&s;ted in the pur|cha&s;e of public &s;tock, together with the intere&s;t or dividends ari&s;ing from time to time, to be eventually accounted for to the proprietors. The commi&s;&s;ioners have, likewi&s;e, a di&s;cretion, upon demand, to deliver over their effects and monies to &s;uch
<PB N="198" REF="028389_0485_0FD8EC0A079F56F8">of the proprietors as do not re&s;ide within the French domi|nions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the propriety of the&s;e acts of Great Britain.&mdash;It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are attended with circum&s;tances which very e&s;&s;entially di&s;criminate them from the thing for which they were quoted. The act of the French government was in &s;ub&s;tance a compul&s;ory a&s;&s;ump|tion of all the property of its citizens in foreign countries. This extraordinary mea&s;ure pre&s;ented two options to the govern|ments of tho&s;e countries&mdash;One, to con&s;ider the tranfer as virtu|ally effected, and to confi&s;cate the property as being no longer that of the individuals, but that of the government of France&mdash;the other, to defeat the effect of her plan by buying up the property for the benefit of the original creditors, in exclu&s;ion of the drafts which they were compelled to draw. Great Bri|tain appears to have elected the latter cour&s;e. If we &s;uppo&s;e her &s;incere in the motive, and there is fairne&s;s and fidelity in the execution, the i&s;&s;ue will be favorable, rather than detri|mental, to the rights of private property.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that there was an option to confi&s;cate. A go|vernment may rightfully confi&s;cate the property of an adver&s;ary government. No principle of ju&s;tice or policy occurs to forbid repri&s;als upon the public or national property of an enemy. That ca&s;e is foreign, in every view, to the principles which pro|tect private property. The exemption &s;tipulated by the 10th article of the treaty is accordingly re&s;tricted to the latter.</P>
<P>It appears, that the government of France, convinced by the effect of the experiment, that the &s;eque&s;tration of the property of the &s;ubjects of her enemies was impolitic, thought fit to re&s;cind it.&mdash;Thence, on the 29th of December, 1794, the convention decreed as follows:</P>
<P>"The decrees concerning the &s;eque&s;tration of the property of the &s;ubjects of the powers at war with the republic, are annulled. Such &s;ums as have been paid by French citizens into the trea&s;ury, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e decrees, will be reim|bur&s;ed."</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the debates upon this decree, it was de|clared, that the decrees which it was to repeal, <HI>had prepared the ruin of commerce,</HI> and had &s;evered, <HI>again&s;t the rights of nations,</HI> the <HI>obligations</HI> of merchants in different &s;tates. This is a direct admi&s;&s;ion, that the &s;eque&s;tration was contrary to the law of nations.</P>
<P>As far as re&s;pects France, then, the precedent, upon the whole, is a &s;trong condemnation of the pretended right to con|fi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter. This formal renunciation of the ground
<PB N="199" REF="028389_0486_0FD8EC0B86E59C18">which was at fir&s;t taken, is a very emphatical prote&s;t again&s;t the principle of the mea&s;ure&mdash;It ought to &s;erve us too as an in&s;tructive warning again&s;t the employment of &s;o mi&s;chievous and di&s;graceful an expedient. And as to England, as has been &s;hown, the precedent is foreign to the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Thus we perceive, that <HI>opinion</HI> and <HI>u&s;age,</HI> far from &s;upport|ing the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private property, on account of national wars, when referred to the <HI>modern</HI> &s;tand|ard, turn again&s;t that right, and coincide with the principle of the article of the treaty under examination.</P>
<P>What remains to be offered will farther illu&s;trate its propri|ety, and reconcile it to all reflecting men.</P>

<P>THE &s;ophi&s;try and deception u&s;ed by the writers in favor of the treaty, are, undoubtedly, as extraordinary as ever were attempted to be impo&s;ed upon a thinking people like the Americans.&mdash;Camillus, the mo&s;t zealous and the mo&s;t ca&s;u|i&s;tical of its defenders, &s;eems, throughout his whole perform|ance, to proceed on the idea, that his mere a&s;&s;ertions will be received, without doubt or enquiry, as oracular truths. But he will find him&s;elf mi&s;erably di&s;appointed. His never-ending co|lumns will be narrowly &s;canned; and, laborious as the attempt mu&s;t be, the grain of wheat will be &s;elected from the immen&s;e heaps of &s;urrounding chaff. I &s;hall take the liberty, occa&s;ional|ly, to lay a few extracts from his numbers, before the public, through the medium of your paper, Mr. <HI>Bache,</HI> with very con|ci&s;e comments; as their ab&s;urdity and fallacy are &s;o &s;elf-evident,
<Q>"As to be hated, need but to be &s;een."</Q></P>
<P>This Briti&s;h patriot, who advocates &s;o elaborately the mo&s;t mi|nute and doubtful rights of England, when he treats on the ca&s;e of our unfortunate, oppre&s;&s;ed, and abandoned &s;ailors, im|pre&s;&s;ed

<P>The barefaced di&s;ingenuity prevalent in this paragraph, of holding out an idea of reciprocity, as if there was any pro|bability of our impre&s;&s;ing Briti&s;h &s;eamen, can hardly be cen|&s;ured; as it is neither more nor le&s;s, than the &s;pirit which runs through the treaty it&s;elf; therefore let that pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall be &s;aid of a man, who pretends to be an American, and yet tells us, that we can have no other peacea|ble &s;ureties, for the protection of a mo&s;t valuable cla&s;s of our citizens, than the <HI>"good faith of England!"</HI> His con&s;cience mu&s;t have &s;mote him when writing the words.

<HEAD>FROM THE LANCASTER JOURNAL. State of Opinions on the Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>THERE remains no longer a doubt that the pre&s;ident has affixed his &s;ignature to the treaty&mdash;but, whether in the execution of this act, he has acted conformably to the voice of a majority of the citizens of the United States, requires at lea&s;t an inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>We find, that in New York, the chamber of commerce, at a &s;mall meeting (of about 33 members) procured a vote of ap|probation, and communicated that to the pre&s;ident as the &s;en&s;e of the whole body of merchants, in that great commercial city.</P>
<P>In Bo&s;ton, not more than thirty-two of the actual mer|chants were &s;uppo&s;ed to appear in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia where the <HI>mania</HI> &s;eemed to have the mo&s;t effect, and where the influence of bank directors, &s;tock jobbers, &amp;c. had its full weight, 410 are &s;aid to have &s;igned the addre&s;s in favor of it.&mdash;But are the&s;e all merchants? No! Among them are &s;hop-keepers, book&s;ellers, brokers, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; an intermixed <HI>phalanx.</HI></P>
<P>So far the mercantile intere&s;t, which the pre&s;ident has vouch|&s;afed to &s;ay, is <HI>"directly affected."</HI> Of tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;ts could not be "affected," as they were not <HI>merchants,</HI> the num|ber is few indeed.&mdash;A meeting near Trenton, and one in the <HI>populous</HI> borough of York, were among the principal; and I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that not more than 400 of this cla&s;s of partizans have collected in the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="028389_0489_0FD8EC106E5918D8">
Thus may we form &s;ome idea of the re&s;pectable and formi|dable &s;upport the treaty has received&mdash;1000 merchants, &s;tock-jobbers, bank-directors, and a few influenced artizans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;earch for &s;omething like a contra or &s;upra credit, to overbalance this tremendous debit. In Charle&s;ton, Philadel|phia, New York, Bo&s;ton, and Port&s;mouth, where the meetings again&s;t the treaty were nearly unanimous in their voice, at lea&s;t 25, 000 citizens are &s;uppo&s;ed to have attended&mdash;add to this, the numerous meetings throughout the union&mdash;a recapitulation of which would be here endle&s;s.</P>
<P>"But," &s;ay the &s;ticklers of government "re&s;pectability of character is on our &s;ide; and the opponents of the treaty are perfectly unacquainted with its merits."</P>
<P>Strange infatuation, or criminal deception, mu&s;t be the ground plan of this building; and &s;uch a foundation can never &s;upport the fabric. Out of at lea&s;t 40, 000 independent citizens of the United States, who pre&s;erve the &s;pirit and dignity of exerci&s;ing their right on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, cannot a &s;uf|ficiency of re&s;pectability be procured, to outweigh that of 1, 000 flatterers of admini&s;tration!</P>
<P>But to expatiate on, or to extend this part of the &s;ubject, is needle&s;s, I believe every unprejudiced mind mu&s;t be fully per|&s;uaded, that the general voice was oppo&s;ed to the treaty.</P>
<P>Though the pre&s;ident mu&s;t have been acquainted with the facts, yet he has thought proper to &s;anction it; and, as he in|forms the &s;elect men of Bo&s;ton, that he only pur&s;ued the dic|tates of his con&s;cience, it becomes our duty to acquie&s;ce in his deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>With due deference to the&s;e con&s;iderations, it may not be improper to enquire into &s;ome of the probable con&s;equences to re&s;ult from the ratification.</P>
<P>Already do we find the French (in con&s;equence, no doubt, of the &s;ucce&s;s the treaty has met with from government) are making encroachments on our trading ve&s;&s;els; and we have rea&s;on to fear, that before long, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end an envoy extraordinary to France, to claim indemnification for Gal|lic &s;poliations on our commerce. But no treaty may be dreaded as the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Attempts at bawling the government into a compliance with the will of the people, would be impolitic, as it might have a di&s;organizing tendency. But let us enquire if we have no peaceable re&s;ource of amendment.</P>
<P>The citizens of the United States, confident of the di&s;ad|vantages of the treaty, applied in a re&s;pectful manner to the
<PB N="203" REF="028389_0490_0FD8EC13C787B048">head of their government, and amply &s;tated its defects. Inde|pendent of a non-compliance, they, perhaps, have not even received that attention which they had a right to expect.</P>
<P>As to the character and affections of the pre&s;ident, no Ame|rican, I tru&s;t, entertains an opinion tending to criminate him. That he is not infallible, is certain, and that he has erred, is probable; but if &s;o, we &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s too great a confidence in him to imagine it any thing but an "error of the judgment, and not of the heart."</P>
<P>If then the treaty is proved to be a public evil, let us trace it to the origin of its ratification: and the &s;tar chamber movements of a my&s;terious &s;enate, who&s;e works are in darkne&s;s, and who&s;e doors and ears are clo&s;ed to the admi&s;&s;ion of public opinions, may lead us, at lea&s;t, to a probable di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Perhaps, then, it is here the calamity exi&s;ts&mdash;here that the government is defective&mdash;and here only that the organs of ad|mini&s;tration are di&s;con&s;onant with the voice of the people.</P>
<P>The means of redre&s;s are obvious. The con&s;titution of our country has anticipated our nece&s;&s;ities. Let us individually and collectively in&s;pect the pa&s;t conduct of our RULERS&mdash;and let the purity of elections be the rallying point of reform.</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE JERSEY CHRONICLE. Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;po&s;ition of Ad|mini&s;tration to France and England.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better information of my fellow citizens of this &s;tate, it may be of great importance to republi&s;h &s;ome facts, that cannot be denied, as to the conduct of the pre&s;ident of the United States, re&s;pecting our connexions with France and Great Britain. They will demon&s;trate an uniform di&s;po|&s;ition to evade a nearer alliance with France, and a clo&s;er in|tercour&s;e with England. As early as the 14th of February, 1791, the pre&s;ident of the United States, in a me&s;&s;age to congre&s;s, &s;ays: "Soon after I was called to the admini&s;tration of the government, I found it important to come to an under|&s;tanding with the court of London, on &s;everal points, intere&s;t|ing
<PB N="204" REF="028389_0491_0FD8EC15A14BA2C8">to the United States, and particularly, to know, whether they were di&s;po&s;ed to enter into arrangements, by mutual con|&s;ent, which might fix the commerce of the two nations on principles of reciprocal advantage, &amp;c. but I do not infer any di&s;po&s;ition, on their part, to enter into any arrangements, merely commercial," &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 13th of December, 1791, Mr. Hammond, the En|gli&s;h mini&s;ter, being arrived, a letter was addre&s;&s;ed to him by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, which mu&s;t have come from the orders of the pre&s;ident, &s;aying: "as you are fully authorized to enter into a negociation, for the purpo&s;e of ar|rangeing the commercial intercour&s;e between the two countries, I have the honor to inform you, that I am ready to receive a communication of your full powers, for that purpo&s;e, at any time you may think proper, and to proceed immediately to their object." Now, it does not appear, that any communica|tions were made to the &s;enate, or that they were con&s;ulted, as to any of the&s;e objects.</P>
<P>But, upon further inve&s;tigation, Mr. Hammond had no pow|ers to treat with us.</P>
<P>On the arrival of Mr. Genet, he communicated a decree of the national convention of France, to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, authoriz|ing him to propo&s;e a treaty with us, on liberal principles, &s;uch as might &s;trengthen the bonds of good will, which unite the two nations, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on, by order of the pre&s;ident, replies in the fol|lowing words; his letter is dated, 23d Augu&s;t, 1793: "<HI>the &s;enate being then in rece&s;s, and not to meet again till fall, I ap|pri&s;ed Mr. Genet, that the participation, in matters of treaty, given by the con&s;titution to that branch of our government</HI> [meaning the &s;enate] <HI>would, of cour&s;e, delay any definitive an&s;wer to his friendly propo&s;ition.</HI>" His letter concludes, "by a&s;&s;uring the national convention, that the pre&s;ident will meet them with the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;itions, on the grounds of treaty, as &s;oon as he could do it by the forms of the con&s;titution."</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, citizens, I &s;tate facts. Nothing was done by the pre&s;ident, as to the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e promi&s;es, when the &s;enate did meet, nor has any thing been done with the advice of the &s;enate, towards that nation, to this day; and I am in|formed, from good authority, that the French nation propo&s;ed by this treaty to give to our citizens and our &s;hips, all the advantages and privileges of their own, in every part of their dominions.</P>
<P>On the 16th of April, 1794, a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the &s;e|nate of the United States, by the pre&s;ident, at the very moment
<PB N="205" REF="028389_0492_0FD8EC16E01D0608">when the hou&s;e of congre&s;s had made mo&s;t &s;alutary regulations, to pre&s;erve and increa&s;e our growing commerce, announcing, that he had nominated John Jay as envoy extraordinary to Great Britain. The me&s;&s;age is in the following words:</P>
<P>"Gentlemen of the &s;enate: The communications I have made to you, during your pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, from the di&s;patches of our mini&s;ter in London, contain a &s;erious a&s;pect of our af|fairs with Great Britain; but as peace ought to be pur&s;ued with unremitted zeal, before the la&s;t re&s;ource, which &s;o often has been the &s;courge of nations, and cannot fail to check the advanced pro&s;perity of the United States, is contemplated, I have thought proper to nominate John Jay, as envoy extraor|dinary from the United States to his Britannic maje&s;ty. My confidence in our mini&s;ter plenipotentiary in London, continues undimini&s;hed; but a mi&s;&s;ion like this, while it corre&s;ponds with the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion, will announce to the world a &s;olicitude for a friendly adju&s;tment of our complaints: going immediately from the United States, &s;uch an envoy will carry with him a full knowledge of the exi&s;ting temper and &s;en&s;ibi|lity of our country, and will thus be taught to vindicate our rights with firmne&s;s, and to cultivate peace with &s;incerity."</P>
<P>I will now draw &s;ome conclu&s;ions from the above facts, leaving it to the good &s;en&s;e of the people of this &s;tate to de|termine, whether they are not &s;uch, as naturally ari&s;e from this &s;tatement, taken from the records and proceedings of our government.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the pre&s;ident has uniformly &s;ought a more intimate connexion with Great Britain; that he has waved the advice and participation of the &s;enate, offering to treat on his own authority; that Great Britain has uniformly evaded a trea|ty, until an embargo threatened the ruin of her i&s;lands, and until the French nation had accompli&s;hed the ruin of her de&s;igns, and nearly the ruin of the nation.</P>
<P>That the forms of the con&s;titution have &s;lept, as innocent and in&s;ignificant, when compared to the friendly overtures of England; but have been held up as in&s;urmountable barriers again&s;t the friendly offers of France.</P>
<P>That the &s;enate (except &s;uch as were known to favor Briti&s;h connexions) were ignorant, like the re&s;t of our citizens, that Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion was to make a treaty of commerce and ami|ty with Great Britain. That they had no grounds to &s;uppo&s;e or &s;u&s;pect, from the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age on his appointment, that he could po&s;&s;ibly have held up an object, containing the wi&s;hes of the whole nation, when he was to be in&s;tructed to aban|don that object. The &s;enate were made to believe it nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="206" REF="028389_0493_0FD8EC186209DE00">to &s;end a &s;pecial envoy, on a &s;pecial occa&s;ion, to carry with him the &s;en&s;ibility of the nation, to vindicate our rights with firmne&s;s; they were told that Mr. Pinckney de&s;erved confidence, as to all matters not important and momentous: had they been inform|ed, that a treaty of commerce and amity was to wind up the ju&s;t expectations of the &s;ufferers; that all our injuries mu&s;t be forgotten; that we mu&s;t bow to in&s;ults, and ki&s;s the tyrant's rod; I tru&s;t that even the &s;enate would have had &s;pirit enough, mi&s;erable advi&s;ers as they are repre&s;ented, to have replied, "That, &s;ince we mu&s;t be degraded, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a &s;pecial envoy, to make it &s;till more mortifying."</P>
<P>"If Mr. Pinckney, who is now in London, is a fit per&s;on to repre&s;ent us, he is able to make a treaty of commerce."</P>
<P>But, to a&s;k advice of the &s;enate to &s;anctify an intended trick upon the feelings and &s;en&s;ibility of the country, might have led to a di&s;appointment; a majority might have put a negative on Mr. Jay's in&s;tructions; but, what is &s;till more important, the whole plan would have been made known to, and have been bla&s;ted for ever by the united voice of, the people.</P>
<P>In my next letter, I &s;hall demon&s;trate clearly, that the treaty, in que&s;tion, ab&s;olutely annihilates all tho&s;e &s;oothing expectations, and all that &s;en&s;ibility, which we find &s;tated and acknowledged, in the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age to the &s;enate, on the appointment of Mr. Jay; that the nation has been &s;ecretly, I will not &s;ay treacherou&s;ly, divorced from France, and mo&s;t clande&s;tinely married to Great Britain: we are taken from the embraces of a loving wife, and find our&s;elves in the arms of a dete&s;table and abandoned w&mdash;e covered with crimes, rottenne&s;s, and corruption.</P>

<P>"Governed (he ob&s;erves) by a wi&s;e con&s;titution, directed &s;olely by the principles of ju&s;tice and rea&s;on, and the pure&s;t maxims of morality&mdash;France is on the point of enjoying the objects of her wi&s;hes, <HI>liberty, equality</HI> and <HI>union,</HI> the fruits of &s;o many &s;acrifices and labours.</P>
<P>"France, always great, <HI>will reply to generous proceedings,</HI> by <HI>proceedings equally generous.</HI> When, <HI>on all &s;ides,</HI> our ri&s;ing re|public was a&s;&s;ailed in its cradle, and the event appeared to be <HI>uncertain,</HI> the <HI>Venetian &s;enate,</HI> not content with keeping within the bounds of <HI>neutrality,</HI> received <HI>with di&s;tinction</HI> the envoy of the French republic.</P>
<P>"We love to talk of, and publi&s;h <HI>our gratitude.</HI> The mea&s;ure was &s;o much the more noble, as it expo&s;ed our faithful ally to <HI>much embarra&s;&s;ment.</HI></P>
<P>"France, under a <HI>de&s;potic you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> might be ungrateful and treacherous; but France, re&s;tored to freedom, becomes a re|public, which <HI>cannot</HI> be otherwi&s;e than <HI>grateful.</HI></P>
<P>"Tell <HI>your nation</HI> that &s;he may number among&s;t the <HI>mo&s;t pure and zealous of her allies,</HI> the French republic. <HI>Holland,</HI> comprized in our treaty with <HI>Spain, proves that we do not for|get our friends.</HI>"</P>
<P>This affectionate addre&s;s cannot but endear France to every benevolent heart. The language is pathetic, and the &s;entiments &s;incere. Far from the parade of <HI>courtly etiquette,</HI> and the <HI>cold civilities of a levee,</HI> the pre&s;ident of the convention welcomes the amba&s;&s;ador with all that fraternal affection, which the <HI>com|mon cau&s;e</HI> of Liberty in&s;pires.</P>
<P>But the&s;e words are more particularly worthy the attention of the Americans, <HI>"France, always great, will reply to generous proceedings, by proceedings equally generous."</HI> As it re&s;pects the United States, can this republic think <HI>our conduct "generous?"</HI> Is it <HI>"generous"</HI> to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation on the <HI>"modern law of nations,"</HI> and publicly to declare to the French, that on <HI>that ground,</HI> the United States meant to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>their neutrality,</HI> and
<PB N="208" REF="028389_0495_0FD8EC221F070DE0">yet admit the Briti&s;h to violate it, by taking our ve&s;&s;els going to France, loaded with provi&s;ions, and other articles, expre&s;sly declared in the afore&s;aid law to be free? Is it <HI>generous</HI> to refu&s;e the overtures of France, for a <HI>commercial treaty,</HI> founded on the mo&s;t liberal principles, and at the &s;ame moment &s;end over a mini&s;ter to the court of Britain, <HI>apparently</HI> for the purpo&s;e of ob|taining <HI>indemnification</HI> for their captures; though, at the &s;ame time, he was authorized to make a treaty of commerce, <HI>in a &s;ecret manner,</HI> without any information to the French republic, on the &s;ubject? More e&s;pecially when it was <HI>&s;o &s;ecret,</HI> that our mini&s;ter in France, was kept ignorant of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>Is it <HI>generous</HI> to enter into a treaty with Britain, to &s;urrender the ground of <HI>"impartial neutrality"</HI> as to the <HI>modern law of nations,</HI> to admit articles as contraband, which were declared, by the <HI>pre&s;ident's proclamation,</HI> to be free, and directly cla&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with our previous promi&s;e to France, that "free &s;hips, &s;hall make free goods?"</P>
<P>Is it <HI>generous</HI> that our treaty with England, &s;hould be &s;o greatly detrimental to France, as to expre&s;sly declare, "that timber for &s;hip-building, tar, or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, and unwrought iron and fir plank only excepted, <HI>&s;hall be objects of confi&s;cation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy?</HI></P>
<P>Is &s;uch a prohibition <HI>"generous,"</HI> as it re&s;pects France, when our treaty with that republic, expre&s;sly declares, that "in gene|ral, <HI>all provi&s;ions,</HI> which &s;erve for the nouri&s;hment of mankind and the &s;u&s;tenance of life; furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, &s;ail cloth, anchors and any part of anchors; al&s;o &s;hip's ma&s;ts, planks, boards, and beams; and all other things proper either for building or repair|ing &s;hips, and all other goods whatever, which have not been worked into the form of any in&s;trument for war, by land or &s;ea, &s;hall <HI>not be reputed contraband?</HI>"</P>
<P>Is it <HI>"generous"</HI> to admit by treaty the provi&s;ions de&s;tined to France to be carried into England, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at &s;uch a price as the <HI>mini&s;try &s;hall &s;ay is a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation,</HI> when they are admitted to be &s;old in France at public market, and at the highe&s;t price?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is needle&s;s to <HI>query</HI> any longer upon the &s;ubject. The features of the treaty too &s;trongly evidence our <HI>partiality</HI> for the Engli&s;h, and <HI>enmity</HI> to the French. The nation now begin to &s;ee our conduct, and begin to expre&s;s their re&s;entment. Their late orders to their agents to &s;top the &s;hipment of provi|&s;ions, no doubt, is in con&s;equence of the treaty; as they find
<PB N="209" REF="028389_0496_0FD8EC2395DCBDA0">by this in&s;trument, we have &s;urrendered every right of our neutrality, de&s;troyed every vital principle of the <HI>pre&s;ident's pro|clamation,</HI> and completely thrown our&s;elves under the &s;ole con|troul and influence of the Briti&s;h nation. They find we have for&s;aken them, and in&s;tead of acting agreeably to the declarati|on made by Mr. <HI>Munroe,</HI> "to draw the bonds of our alliance clo&s;er," we have, by Mr. <HI>Jay's</HI> negociation, <HI>&s;evered the con|nexion,</HI> and ru&s;hed into the arms of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>This treaty will lower the produce of the United States, 100 per cent. Our &s;hips will peri&s;h at our wharves&mdash;our trade&s;men will be thrown out of employ&mdash;and, in return, we &s;hall be ble&s;&s;|ed with a <HI>land tax,</HI> to di&s;charge Briti&s;h debts, and our &s;ea-ports and trading towns &s;oon be thronged with Briti&s;h and Scotch agents and factors. Ble&s;&s;ed effects of Mr. Jay's treaty!!!</P>
<P>Can France expre&s;s that cordiality to the United States, as &s;he does to Venice? Or are our proceedings towards her, &s;uch, that we can expect any thing, in return, but her re&s;entment?</P>
<P>The fate of America is &s;u&s;pended on the treaty, which in|volves in it a que&s;tion, whether we will return, by a clande&s;tine treaty, to Britain, to be again &s;ubject to her in&s;olence and arbi|trary mea&s;ures, or whether we will &s;upport that "<HI>modern</HI> neu|trality" pledged, to the United States, by the pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The treaty, made by Mr. Jay, is in direct oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;ident's proclamation; upon what principle <HI>he</HI> has ratified it, requires, therefore, an explanation more copious than he has deigned to expre&s;s in his letter to the town of Bo&s;ton, and the other citizens who have addre&s;&s;ed him on this momentous &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is in the power of America, by commercial re&s;trictions, to vindicate her national honor, without any danger of a war; as we have as much right to &s;ay, that we will not import <HI>Bri|ti&s;h manufactures,</HI> as France has to &s;ay, &s;he will not purcha&s;e American provi&s;ions. The Americans may as well &s;ay, that they would declare war again&s;t France, for her late orders to her agents, as the Briti&s;h pretend to go to war with Ame|rica, for preventing the importation of their manufactures. The war is a mere bugbear of the Briti&s;h faction, and tho&s;e who are concerned in the Engli&s;h trade; as the&s;e very per&s;ons know that if Mr. <HI>Madi&s;on's</HI> re&s;olutions or a non-importation had taken place, Britain would have been obliged to make peace with France.</P>
<P>But to our di&s;grace, and po&s;&s;ibly ruin, we have tampered too long with the magnanimity of this generous republic. Our narrow policy, for the &s;upport of a &s;et of bank &s;peculators, it is to be feared, has for ever &s;eparated France from America.</P>

<P>AT length the illegitimate imp, the abortion of liberty, has crawled from its &s;culking place, and, contrary to the wi&s;hes of its <HI>parent</HI> and of its <HI>god-fathers,</HI> has peeped into day. Dive&s;ted of the darkne&s;s which encompa&s;&s;ed it, we may now behold and examine the foul blotches that over&s;pread it, and trace a pe&s;tiferous malady oozing from every pore. That imagination mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon portion of poe|tic phrenzy; it mu&s;t have boldly &s;oared into the regions of extravagance, and have viewed human nature in its utmo&s;t de|formity, that could have figured to it&s;elf a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, &s;o replete with ho&s;tility to a gene|rous and magnanimous ally, and &s;o prolific of enmity to the e&s;&s;ential rights of a free, &s;overeign, and independent people.</P>
<P>Yes, citizens of America, we have <HI>virtually,</HI> though not formally, become a party in the confederacy of de&s;pots again&s;t liberty, and have &s;urrendered the rights of an independent nation into the hands of Great Britain. We have become her colonies <HI>in jact,</HI> though not in form; and our honor and our intere&s;ts, our gratitude and our liberty, are placed under her guardian&s;hip. The treaty formed with France, in the hour of danger and adver&s;ity, when the heavy clouds of tyranny had darkened our horizon, and were ready to bur&s;t upon our heads, has been paralized by our government; and the nation, again&s;t which every arm &s;hould have been nerved, and every mind electrified with abhorrence, is to u&s;urp the place due to grati|tude and liberty. Now the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>policy</HI> of our admini|&s;tration, nay, its <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> too, will receive a full expo&s;ition, from the treaty it&s;elf&mdash;Now the <HI>vindication of our rights with firmne&s;s</HI> will be &s;een in its meridian &s;plendor&mdash;now the <HI>adju&s;t|ment of our complaints</HI> will exhibit it&s;elf in all its brilliancy&mdash;and now that <HI>temper and &s;en&s;ibility of our country,</HI> which was to <HI>aid,</HI> if not direct, the negociation, will &s;tand unma&s;ked, and prompt &s;en&s;ations, at which con&s;cience &s;hould &s;tart back with horror. Let us, my fellow citizens, take a view of this mimi|tables bantling&mdash;its royal charms will &s;mooth its con&s;titutional
<PB N="211" REF="028389_0498_0FD8EC2BAD607098">deformity, and enamour us into an oblivion of violated rights and u&s;urped authority. We were tickled with the high pro&s;pects of commercial advantage, which we were to derive from our intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies; let us view the ar|ticle upon which tho&s;e pro&s;pects are bottomed, and then &s;ay, whether the man who could a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch terms, can po&s;&s;i|bly be con&s;idered as the friend of his country? We &s;hall be at liberty to trade to his Britannic maje&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t Indies, in ve&s;&s;els not exceeding <HI>&s;eventy tons,</HI> and bring from thence the produce of tho&s;e i&s;lands; but we &s;hall not be permitted to export &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, mela&s;&s;es, or cotton, to any part of the world. This article robs us, at a blow, of the carrying trade, and deprives us of the privilege of export|ing We&s;t India produce, although imported from other i&s;lands &mdash;Nay, there is not an exception in favor of cotton, the growth of our own country; and it is well known, that we export cotton from &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates to a con&s;iderable amount. Does not this article ju&s;tify the opinion, that we have again become the colonies of Great Britain? Does it not give ri&s;e to a belief, that the man who put his &s;eal to it, could not be a friend to America? The art with which it is incorporated with the other articles of the treaty, excepting the fir&s;t ten, &s;hows that either this was to be accepted, or the whole mu&s;t totter, and, rather than &s;uch an immaculate conception &s;hould be &s;tifled in embryo, we have accepted the treaty with a mo&s;t extraordinary provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, fellow citizens, that the treaty, in all its parts, is prohibitory upon America&mdash;You will di&s;cover, that the United States were an inferior party in the contract, and that when his Britannic maje&s;ty only permits and <HI>con&s;ents,</HI> we agree and are bound&mdash;You will &s;ee France pointed at, though not literally de&s;ignated, and every provi&s;ion, that can po&s;&s;ibly mili|tate again&s;t her, &s;olemnly &s;tipulated&mdash;You will &s;ee her exclud|ed from renewing the bonds of good will, which unite the people of both countries, and which &s;he had proffered to renew, when Great Britain was plotting again&s;t our liberty and peace&mdash; You will &s;ee our country degraded, and throwing it&s;elf upon the mercy of a Briti&s;h tyrant.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I a&s;k, nay, I demand of you, fellow citizens, whether the revolution was de&s;igned to rid our|&s;elves or a foreign, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a dome&s;tic, tyranny? Whether it was for the benefit of a whole people, or to aggrandi&s;e a few individuals? The que&s;tion is in time and in place; for if any individual among us, can pur&s;ue the dictates of his own feelings, or his own whims, at the expen&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;olemn
<PB N="212" REF="028389_0499_0FD8EC2C899E6AE8">and &s;acred covenant, and in contradiction to the univer&s;al voice of a whole people, then have we overturned foreign to make room for dome&s;tic domination. The next attempt that we may anticipate, will be upon the freedom of the pre&s;s; for a conduct &s;o repugnant to every &s;en&s;e of propriety, as that of the admini&s;tration, cannot bear the ordeal of the pre&s;s; and it mu&s;t endeavour to &s;helter it&s;elf, by impo&s;ing a &s;ilence upon the only voice that can &s;peak daggers to inju&s;tice, and awaken the public mind to tyranny. Did my imagination create it, or is it really true! Methinks there is already a con&s;ultation of &s;uch &s;ort, and that the patriotic and virtuous editor of the Auro|ra is to be the fir&s;t victim!</P>
<P>Our <HI>good faith</HI> to France, my fellow citizens, will become proverbial; and our rigid adherence to national honor, and national obligation, mu&s;t procure many admirers and many friends. We have not only formed a treaty with Great Britain, directly to the prejudice of our allies; but we have deceived tho&s;e allies, and di&s;honored our&s;elves, by declaring to them, that the object of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion was only to obtain a re|dre&s;s of wrongs. The French mini&s;ter here was officially in|formed, that the mi&s;&s;ion, as &s;et forth in the pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age to the &s;enate, contemplated only an adju&s;tment of our com|plaints; and our mini&s;ter in France, in an&s;wer to an applica|tion of the French government, gave official information, that a redre&s;s of wrongs only, was the object of Mr. Jay's n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">goci|ation. Thus have we added in&s;ult to injury, and, by means of it, expo&s;ed our&s;elves to the ju&s;t indignation of a great, gallant, and triumphant people. This Punic faith requires no commen|tary of mine&mdash;it has &s;tamped upon it, in lines too &s;trong to be mi&s;interpreted, and too indelible to be obliterated, an image, which mu&s;t excite abhorrence in the mind of every virtuous American.</P>

<P>INGENUOUSNESS ought to be as much the attribute of a freeman as independence, and the forfeiture of the former is too frequently the prelude to the pro&s;titution of the latter. The man that can act a double, or an uncandid part, in one tran&s;action, can do &s;o in many; for if his con&s;cience or principles are not at all times powerful enough to re&s;train him,
<PB N="213" REF="028389_0500_0FD8EC2E37B46FE0">temptation may, any time, &s;educe him from the path of politi|cal ju&s;tice or moral rectitude. I alleged, in my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, that France was deceived by the profe&s;&s;ions of our admini&s;tration, and that at the time we a&s;&s;ured her we were only aiming at an indemnity for robbery, and a &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, we were, in fact, negociating a treaty with Great Britain. This decep|tion does not &s;tand alone; for the title of the treaty bears the &s;ame, if not a &s;tronger &s;tamp of political unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. It is called a "treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States of America, by their pre&s;ident, <HI>with the advice and con&s;ent of their &s;enate.</HI>" I aver, that the &s;enate knew not that a treaty was to be negoci|ated: for the pre&s;ident was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject in his me&s;&s;age; and when a motion was made in the &s;enate, to reque&s;t the pre|&s;ident to inform the &s;enate of the <HI>whole bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> with which the envoy was to be charged, it was negatived; how then could it be denominated a treaty, negociated "with the advice and con|&s;ent of the &s;enate?" Two conclu&s;ions are naturally drawn from this circum&s;tance&mdash;that the executive mu&s;t have believed the con&s;titution made the advice of the &s;enate nece&s;&s;ary, or he would not have had it placed on the very face of the treaty; and that a deception was practi&s;ed by in&s;erting the advice of the &s;enate to a treaty concluded in London, when the &s;enate was not con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>This &s;uperce&s;&s;ion of the con&s;titution, and arre&s;tation of the prerogative of the &s;enate, may be con&s;idered as non-e&s;&s;ential, as the &s;enate had an ultimate deci&s;ion upon the treaty. A little con&s;ideration will &s;how the fallacy and danger of this rea&s;oning; for if the pre&s;ident has the right to di&s;pen&s;e with the advice of the &s;enate, he has an equal right to di&s;pen&s;e with their con&s;ent, and render their participation with him in matters of treaty altogether nugatory. "The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur." The in|tention of this clau&s;e appears to be, to guard again&s;t the exor|bitant power delegated to the pre&s;ident, by rendering the advice of the &s;enate nece&s;&s;ary to a negociation. They are the joint judges of the propriety of forming a treaty, as well as the arbi|ters of it, when it is made. If the pre&s;ident had the exclu&s;ive power to negociate treaties, it would be a kind of dictator&s;hip, an exclu&s;ive &s;overeignty, that would enable him to form treaties in &s;uch a way, as would render it extremely hazardous in the &s;enate to refu&s;e their con&s;ent. Our rights may be bartered away by treaty, our liberties made an affair of hazard, as is the ca&s;e in the treaty before us Could a free people have intended a
<PB N="214" REF="028389_0501_0FD8EC2FAB7CB890">delegation of &s;uch powers to a &s;enate, much le&s;s to an indi|vidual? They never intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;pecies of royalty in fact, though not in name, and put it in the power of <HI>one man</HI> to legi&s;late for them, by means of treaties.</P>
<P>In the preamble of the treaty, fellow citizens, we find this remarkable clau&s;e: "His Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States of America, being de&s;irous by a treaty of amity, com|merce, and navigation, to terminate their differences in &s;uch a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions, may be the be&s;t calculated to pro|duce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding." With this clau&s;e &s;taring us in the face, in the preamble of the treaty, what had we to expect from the treaty it&s;elf? Well, indeed, might Great Britain negociate with us, when we &s;o complai|&s;antly waved our <HI>complaints</HI> and <HI>preten&s;ions!</HI> The pre&s;ident, in his me&s;&s;age to the &s;enate, nominating John Jay as envoy extra|ordinary, &s;peaks of the mi&s;&s;ion being de&s;igned to procure a friendly <HI>adju&s;tment of cur complaints.</HI> "But a mi&s;&s;ion like this," &s;ays the me&s;&s;age, "while it corre&s;ponds with the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion, will announce to the world, a &s;olicitude for a friendly adju&s;tment of our complaints:" and in the introduc|tion to the treaty, the&s;e very complaints are abandoned! Strange paradox indeed, that the mi&s;&s;ion &s;hould have expre&s;sly contemplated an adju&s;tment of our complaints, if the me&s;&s;age was not an entire deception, and that a reference to tho&s;e com|plaints &s;hould have been formally di&s;avowed! When agreements of this kind are entered into, the injuries of the parties are &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal, and their demands the &s;ame; but in this ca&s;e, were our re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions mutual?</P>
<P>Had <HI>we</HI> robbed Great Britain! Had <HI>we</HI> kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part of her territory, which was to have been &s;urrendered by &s;olemn and po&s;itive &s;tipulation? Had <HI>we</HI> invaded her territory, and made military &s;ettlements within her juri&s;diction? Had <HI>we</HI> joined the &s;avages again&s;t her, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in butchering her &s;ubjects? Had <HI>we</HI> impre&s;&s;ed her &s;eamen, contrary to every rule of ju&s;tice, and obligation of humanity? Had <HI>we</HI> offered her every outrage and every indignity, which one nation could offer to another? Whence then the mutuality of complaints and pre|ten&s;ions, that made a reference to them a thing &s;o much to be deprecated, as to be entirely laid a&s;ide? So extraordinary a phenomenon as this, is certainly not to be met with in diplo|matic hi&s;tory. It will &s;tand alone upon the li&s;t of wonders, and &s;erve as a high water mark of pro&s;titution of a nation's rights. Surely the envoy could not have been &s;o far intoxicated with the plea&s;ure of ki&s;&s;ing the quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s hand, having already
<PB N="215" REF="028389_0502_0FD8EC31058285C0">pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of gallantry, unle&s;s we could &s;uppo&s;e him to be in his dotage, as to have forgotten that we had complaints to redre&s;s, and preten&s;ions to &s;atisfy! Surely Grenville's wine did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the qualities of the waters of Lethe, to have effaced from his remembrance that he was an <HI>American</HI> envoy, and that America had been grievou&s;ly injured, and barbarou&s;ly outraged!</P>
<P>Fellow citizens, had our condition been a de&s;perate one&mdash;had we been &s;o humbled as to have had no re&s;ource left but in the clemency of Great Britain&mdash;had the energy of freedom been &s;ucceeded by the pal&s;y of de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;then, indeed, might we have waved every reference to our injuries and our di&s;honor: but in the zenith of vigour and pro&s;perity, to abandon our claims, and, with a beggar's &s;upplene&s;s, demand our own in charity, is &s;uch a flagitious departure from every principle that ought to animate the American bo&s;om, that we ought at the &s;ame time to pity and de&s;pi&s;e the man who could &s;o far forget his own and the dignity of his country.</P>

<P>SOME very mi&s;taken notions appear in circulation on this &s;ubject, the e&s;&s;ence of which you find in a late paper, where a writer calls a treaty an act more binding than the con&s;titu|tion, and more influential than any law. This is &s;urely here&s;y again&s;t the con&s;titution. All that is &s;aid in that in&s;trument about treaties, is as follows:</P>
<Q><BIBL>In art. 2. &s;ect. 2.</BIBL>
<P>"The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the &s;enators concur."</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL>In art. 3. &s;ect. 2.</BIBL>
<P>"The judicial power &s;hall extend to all ca&s;es in law and equity, ari&s;ing under this con&s;titution, the laws of the United States and treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, under their authority."</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL>In art. 6.</BIBL>
<P>"This con&s;titution, and the laws of the United States, which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof&mdash;and all trea|ties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land, and the judges of every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith|&s;tanding."</P></Q>
<P><PB N="216" REF="028389_0503_0FD8EC35A93BF820">
Now, &s;urely, from all this, it is apparent, that, in the order &s;tated, the con&s;titution &s;tands fir&s;t, as the &s;upreme law of the land; next, the laws of the United States, made in pur&s;uance thereof; next, treaties: Undoubtedly, therefore, no act can be more binding than the con&s;titution; no treaty more influ|ential than any law pa&s;&s;ed by the three branches of the govern|ment; otherwi&s;e, in fact, two branches of the government would &s;uper&s;ede entirely the authority of the third&mdash;How the judges would decide, &s;hould the&s;e three &s;upreme laws happen to differ, remains to be &s;een. It is al&s;o worthy of enquiry, what authority could ab&s;olve us from a treaty made the &s;upreme law of our land, &s;uppo&s;ing it violated by the other contracting party? It can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould go on to continue to con&s;ider it as obligatory, when it &s;hould have been broken by the party with whom it was made.</P>

<HEAD>ATTICUS&mdash;No. III.</HEAD>
<P>[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 215.]</P>
<P>AFTER reading the preamble, we might &s;hut our eyes upon the treaty, and augur its contents; for when a re|ference to the merits of our complaints is po&s;itively forbidden in the introduction, it would be folly to look for an adju&s;tment of them in the treaty it &s;elf. In this, to be &s;ure, we have acted with much chri&s;tian meekne&s;s; we have forgotten and forgiv|en; and, with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion very uncommon to men or to nati|ons, after being &s;mote upon one cheek, we have held the other. To evidence our humility, however, it was not e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary to commi&s;&s;ion the chief ju&s;tice to pro&s;trate the American character and intere&s;t, at the foot of the throne of his maje&s;ty, George the third&mdash;we might have been &s;ilent to our outrages, pa&s;&s;ive under our indignities, and groaned beneath our wrongs, without having them reverberated from the throne of a de&s;pi|cable de&s;pot. The <HI>"&s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion"</HI> would then have been le&s;s awful; for America might have <HI>mourned</HI> over her in|juries, without inviting the world to behold her degradation. Let the light of inve&s;tigation, however, now &s;hine upon &s;uch a work of darkne&s;s; let its caverns be explored; let the trap doors to liberty, be unequivocally marked out, that the un|&s;u&s;pecting, and yet confident, American, may behold in tho&s;e di&s;mal rece&s;&s;es, the guillotine of his country's rights and inde|pendence. Be a&s;&s;ured, my fellow citizens, the moment the treaty acquires a legal exi&s;tence in our country, that moment we naturalize an hydra, which will require an Hercules to ex|terminate him&mdash;that moment we &s;ign the death warrant of our liberty, and toll the bell for its execution.</P>
<P>Let us take a view of the 2d article, which is to relieve us from the ills of Pandora, that have i&s;&s;ued, in the mo&s;t hideous &s;hapes, upon the citizens of our frontier, from the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and have drained the United States of many millions of dollars, and much of the blood of their citizens. The treaty of peace &s;olemnly &s;tipulated, that his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hould "<HI>with all convenient &s;peed,</HI> withdraw all his armies, garri&s;ons, and fleets, from the United States, and from every port, place, and harbour, within the &s;ame;" and the pre&s;ent treaty provides
<PB N="220" REF="028389_0507_0FD8EC3C4A786F68">for the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts in June, 1796. Near twelve years have elap&s;ed &s;ince the definitive articles, of the treaty of peace, were &s;igned at Paris; and yet the&s;e po&s;ts &s;till remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h, and if "all convenient &s;peed" can be interpreted to mean twelve years, the evacuation, in June 1796, may be expounded to mean a century. We had a reliance upon the faith of Great Britain, at that time, and &s;he proved perfidious; we have renewed that reliance, under another in|&s;trument, and we flatter our&s;elves &s;he will be more &s;crupulous in the ob&s;ervance of the contract! <HI>Quem Deus vult perdere pri|us dementat;</HI> we &s;eem to be marked for de&s;truction, and folly is paving the way for it.</P>
<P>By this article, the king has been <HI>"graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed"</HI> (to u&s;e the language of the envoy) to permit the United States to ex|tend their &s;ettlements within <HI>their own boundary line,</HI> at their di&s;cretion, except within the precincts or juri&s;diction of any of the po&s;ts. What a favor! The treaty is &s;aid to contain no reciprocity; but is not this reciprocity enough! To be permit|ted to extend our &s;ettlements within <HI>our own territory,</HI> is an in|dulgence, for which we cannot be &s;ufficiently grateful! What a pity the envoy did not obtain his maje&s;ty's gracious permi&s;&s;i|on to enlarge the boundaries of Philadelphia or New York! So <HI>"great, good, and dear a friend"</HI> could certainly not have refu&s;ed <HI>"&s;uch an envoy"</HI> &s;uch a reque&s;t!!!</P>
<P>The vocabulary of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion appears to have been ran&s;ack|ed, to &s;uit the American part of the treaty (if any part can be &s;trictly called American) and the rights which valour gave, and blood confirmed, we &s;eem now to receive as a boon.&mdash;Does not this article contain a tacit confe&s;&s;ion, that Great Britain had a right to prevent our &s;ettlements within our own bounda|ry line? Why was it not &s;tipulated equally on the part of Great Britain, that &s;he &s;hould be allowed to extend her &s;ettle|ments, at her di&s;cretion, within the Canadian limits? She never would have &s;tooped to &s;uch an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>But what are WE to under&s;tand by the precincts or juri&s;|diction of the po&s;ts? The Briti&s;h have given a very liberal al|lowance of territory to that juri&s;diction, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have been mode&s;t enough to claim an exten&s;ion of pre|cincts to the Ohio.&mdash;Who is to draw the line? No doubt this will receive an expo&s;ition, in the u&s;ual way, and a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> lex|icon will be found to explain this knotty point. We have an admini&s;tration &s;o complai&s;ant, that they never can find it in their hearts to cavil with his maje&s;ty George the Third. Whatever quirks and quibbles may be made u&s;e of to French <HI>&s;ans culottes, a king</HI> is certainly entitled to more deference and more re&s;pect.
<PB N="221" REF="028389_0508_0FD8EC44633FF8B8">&mdash;Quere. Is the &s;ettlement which <HI>Simcoe</HI> made at the rapids of the Miami, and about which a <HI>hollow vociferation</HI> was made, within the precincts and juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts? That eu|nuch of a &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e political gender remains yet to be defined, and who is <HI>"every thing by turns, and nothing long,"</HI> will deign to inform us.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary part of this article, fellow citizens, remains yet to be con&s;idered&mdash;a part which allows a Briti&s;h colony to be e&s;tabli&s;hed within the juri&s;diction of the United States. Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hall have their election either to remain &s;ubjects of Great Britain, within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts, or to become American citizens! We have often been &s;tunned with the <HI>"imperium in imperio:"</HI> but what will be now &s;aid of a <HI>Briti&s;h imperium</HI> in <HI>an American imperio!</HI> We cannot charge this to <HI>&s;elf-creation,</HI> when the fir&s;t of our go|vernment has given it a being. By this article, we have given a <HI>carte blanche</HI> to con&s;piracy, and a premium for in&s;urrections again&s;t our government. By the con&s;titution of the United States, trea&s;on con&s;i&s;ts "in levying war again&s;t the United States, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."&mdash;Now I would a&s;k, whether, according to the &s;econd article of the treaty, a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts, who has not elected to become an American citizen, can be guilty of trea&s;on? May he not levy war, give aid and comfort to OUR enemies, without incurring the penalties to which American citizens are &s;ubject?</P>
<P>"They &s;hall not be compelled to take any oath of allegiance to the government;" but, owing allegiance to Great Britain, by <HI>po&s;itive compacts,</HI> is he not furni&s;hed with a &s;ecurity again&s;t pu|ni&s;hment for acts, which are trea&s;onable to us, but which his &s;overeign calls on him to perform? The <HI>tacit</HI> condition of be|ing &s;ubject to the laws, cannot &s;urely operate again&s;t a <HI>&s;pecific grant;</HI> and a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, within that juri&s;diction, &s;eems to be excluded from the general principle comprehended in the law of nations. In the 26th article, a remedy is provided again&s;t Briti&s;h merchants who &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s our laws; but, in the article before us, nothing of the &s;ort is contemplated. If there was not to be a difference between the per&s;ons comprehended in the 29th article, and tho&s;e comprehended in the 2d, why were they not equally expre&s;&s;ive? It appears, that his maje&s;ty was de&s;irous of &s;ecuring a corps within our territory, that would always be devoted to him, whenever he &s;hould call for their &s;ervices, and, in ca&s;e of a war, they might prove u&s;eful in&s;truments, as u&s;eful as the &s;avages, in carrying his gracious intentions into effect.</P>

<P>How this article is made to harmonize with the territorial. rights of the individual &s;tates, guaranteed by the con&s;titution, mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e to determine, who have the wonderful faculty of making the con&s;titution mean any thing or nothing. The con&s;titution &s;ays, that "<HI>the congre&s;s</HI> &s;hall have power to di&s;po&s;e of, and make all u&s;eful rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territory or other property of <HI>the United States;</HI> and no|thing in this con&s;titution &s;hall be &s;o con&s;trued as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or <HI>of any particular &s;tate.</HI>" Have any of the &s;tates claims upon the territory within the juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts?

<P>Violation of con&s;titution, pro&s;tration of character and of rights, and an ignominious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to outrage and in&s;ult, have gone hand in hand in this tran&s;action.

<P>THE tele&s;cope of Her&s;chel is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover the ad|vatages &s;aid to be contained in the treaty with Great Britain; for they are &s;o di&s;tant and &s;o ob&s;cure, that, like the mountains in the moon, they can only be &s;een through an ex|traordinary magnifying medium. We are told, that the oftener we view the treaty, the more we will like it; but although a repetition of impre&s;&s;ion dimini&s;hes our &s;en&s;ations, even with re&s;pect to the beauty or deformity of things, the treaty &s;tands an unrivalled exception; for the oftener we gaze at it. the more do the features of deformity unfold them&s;elves to &s;hock the &s;en&s;e. Reciprocity ought to be the ba&s;is of all commercial trea|ties; but this in&s;trument di&s;covers &s;uch favoriti&s;m, that we look in vain for equality; for while the gho&s;t of reciprocity is to be
<PB N="223" REF="028389_0512_0FD8EC4FCE04B6F0">our portion, the &s;ub&s;tantial reality is embraced by Great Bri|tain. In illu&s;tration of this, let us refer to the 3d article, and pur&s;ue the <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> through the bogs and quagmires con|trived for the ingenuous and un&s;u&s;pecting American.&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is agreed that it &s;hall, at all times, be free to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the &s;aid boundary line, freely to pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is under&s;tood, that this article does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the &s;ea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories; nor into &s;uch parts of the rivers in his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories, as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trad|ing <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Quebec, under &s;uch regu|lations as &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect. Nor to the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t port of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea. The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;hall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports or places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, <HI>to which&s;oever of the parties belonging,</HI> may freely be re&s;orted to, and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ty, in Great Britain."</P>
<P><HI>Unequal</HI> as are the benefits which the contracting parties have to be&s;tow, the&s;e benefits are far from being reciprocal to the United States, although the whole inland navigation, forming a &s;emicircle from the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi to the river St. Lawrence, together with the Atlantic waters, are thrown open to Great Britain. Are the territories and countries of the two parties on the continent, equal, and if they are equal, are the privileges granted to both, the &s;ame? for there mu&s;t be an entire equality, to con&s;titute the boa&s;ted reciprocity.&mdash;What are the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, from which there is to be an exclu&s;ion?</P>
<P>The returns of the Hud&s;on's Bay company from America, are in value &pound;. 29, 340 &s;terling, annually, and from the limits of this company we are to be totally excluded.&mdash;This company engro&s;&s;es the mo&s;t valuable part of the fur trade, as the coun|try over which their privileges extend, abounds with animals
<PB N="224" REF="028389_0513_0FD8EC52EF456CD8">who&s;e furs are preferable to tho&s;e inhabiting a le&s;s northerly region. Thus we have not only refu&s;ed interfering with a pro|fitable branch of their commerce, but we have afforded them an opportunity of extending it to our own prejudice; for when their traders are at liberty to make &s;ettlements within our ter|ritory, to "hire and po&s;&s;e&s;s hou&s;es and ware hou&s;es" we are wholly interdicted, and, therefore, there can be no doubt on which &s;ide the current of advantage will run.</P>
<P>We have granted Great Britain the free navigation of <HI>all our waters,</HI> internal and Atlantic, to the highe&s;t port of entry, when &s;he has excluded us from the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay com|pany, and all her Atlantic ports in America. The privilege of trading between Montreal and Quebec, if it can merit this appellation, is on the other &s;ide; for the inhabitants of New York, bordering on Canada, will derive their &s;upplies from thence, and thus afford an additional outlet for Briti&s;h manu|factures. It is a que&s;tion, and the <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of this article will warrant it, how far we are liberty to avail our&s;elves of the privilege granted by the treaty of peace, to dry our fi&s;h, or to take them in any place where the juri&s;diction of Great Britain is acknowledged? By the treaty of peace we are allowed "to take fi&s;h on all the coa&s;ts, bays and creeks of his Britannic ma|je&s;ty's dominions in America, and to dry and cure fi&s;h in any of the un&s;ettled bays, harbours, and creeks of Nova Scotia, Mag|dalen I&s;lands, and Labradore, &s;o long as the &s;ame &s;hall remain un&s;ettled;" by the pre&s;ent treaty we are barred this privilege&mdash; "But it is under&s;tood, that this article does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the &s;ea ports, <HI>har|bours, bays</HI> or <HI>creeks</HI> of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories."

<P>THE ground of regular defence being abandoned by the Jayites, recour&s;e is had to bu&s;h fighting; and we are told, that it is improper and dangerous to deliver the opinion of an aggregate body on the mea&s;ures of government. This is con&s;i|dered as an attempt to dictate to our government, to controul its actions, nay, to awe it into compliance with the popular voice. Whether the popular voice, in a popular government, ought to dictate public mea&s;ures, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;i|der; and, from this digre&s;&s;ion, return again to the treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="028389_0515_0FD8EC599525A688">
If the propriety or the right of many to give an opinion on public mea&s;ures is a que&s;tionable thing, the right of an indi|vidual mu&s;t altogether vani&s;h; for the right or wrong, the pro|priety or impropriety, in a republican &s;en&s;e, is proportionate to the many or the few, who deliver an opinion. If a majority is to direct the public will, then the expre&s;&s;ion of that majori|ty mu&s;t be proper and ju&s;t; and the nearer the approach to that majority, the &s;tronger the right to a direction of that will. A nation has the right to will; and this will, in a legi|timate government, can only be expre&s;&s;ed by the majority, and ought only to be operative, when this is a&s;certained; &s;urely, then, the right is in an a&s;cending &s;eries, from an individual to the majority. If the right of many is then to be que&s;tioned, what will become of the preten&s;ions of an individual? for it &s;urely will not be contended by a republican, that one man &s;hall have more con&s;ideration and more rights than a number. The majority of the people of America declared them&s;elves independent of Great Britain; and this was &s;uppo&s;ed by them a meritorious and ju&s;t declaration, and dare not, even now, be que&s;tioned by the ari&s;tocrats, but, according to the pre&s;ent doctrine, this was an unpardonable act; for it was an attack upon the "con&s;tituted authorities," it was a &s;ubver&s;ion of the &s;ettled order of things. The majority of the people of the United States, made a con&s;titution for their government; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hinged the old &s;y&s;tem of things under the confederation; &s;urely this was an unju&s;tifiable act; for it was a mea&s;ure which deranged the con&s;tituted authorities. It the people had a right to throw off their allegiance from Great Britain, if they had a right to &s;ubvert the confederation and e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;titution, will their right be que&s;tioned to expre&s;s di&s;approbation of an iniquitous law? Dare a que&s;tion be agitated, whether they have the right to give an opinion to the con&s;tituted authorities, nay, to change the con&s;tituted authorities them&s;elves? Suppo&s;e the majority of the people were to declare the pre&s;ent con&s;ti|tution anti-republican, that it was unfriendly to their liberties, who would di&s;pute their right to make another? will &s;uch ephemerons as Fenno and Web&s;ter oppo&s;e &s;uch a will, or con|trovert &s;uch a doctrine? Who will be bold enough to &s;ay, that the people have not the right to will their own happine&s;s, un|der any form of government, and under what laws they plea&s;e? Is our government a purcha&s;e in fee &s;imple, or an inheri|tance, that the people have no right to interfere in its ope|rations?</P>
<P>Is ours a government of the people, or of the officers of government: If it is a government of the people, they cer|tainly
<PB N="227" REF="028389_0516_0FD8EC5B514DEA98">have the right to &s;ay by what rules they will be regulated; for it is a &s;oleci&s;m to &s;ay, a man is his own governor, when he is denied a voice on public mea&s;ures. If it is a government of the rulers, then is our &s;y&s;tem changed, and, in&s;tead of a republic, we are in oligarchy. Although the doctrine which I have been combating, implies that we are not a government of the people, but that of an oligarchy, will any one, on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, come forward and avow the &s;entiment? Art and de&s;ign have too much to do with it to be thus explicit.</P>
<P>To pro&s;cribe town meetings, or indeed any other mode of collecting the &s;en&s;e of the people, is not extraordinary for men who have a point to gain. It is as ea&s;y for them to pane|gyrize as to condemn, when their purpo&s;es can be accom|pli&s;hed; and, contradictory as this may &s;eem, the fact will appear, by referring to the Gazette of the United States, or any other paper under the &s;ame influence. When the pre&s;i|dent's proclamation of neutrality appeared, the legality and propriety of it were &s;everely arraigned, and, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, it was thought proper to convene town meetings, in many parts of the &s;tates, to approbate the mea&s;ure. The merchants of Philadelphia had a meeting, and marched in grave and &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to deliver their addre&s;s, in its fa|vor, to the pre&s;ident. If aggregate opinions were not improper, at that time, by what rule of ratiocination will they be con|demned now? Were they more orderly then than they are now? This certainly will not be alleged; for there is not an in&s;tance upon record, in which a town meeting was conducted with more order, more decorum, and more harmony, than the late one at the &s;tate hou&s;e. Perhaps they were compo&s;ed of a better order of beings at that time; and, from their &s;uperior con&s;ideration, legitimized a thing in them&s;elves, that would have been criminal in others.</P>
<P>When men apply their &s;caling ladders to the citadel of re|publicani&s;m it&s;elf, no wonder they &s;hould attack its out-po&s;ts; for if the citadel is not con&s;ecrated again&s;t inva&s;ion, its lines cannot expect &s;ecurity. Look into the Minerva and the Gazette of the United States, and behold republicani&s;m it&s;elf arraigned; what &s;ecurity have we then to expect for an attribute, that is denied to the being it&s;elf! When e&s;&s;ays and paragraphs in fa|vor of <HI>monarchy</HI> can find a channel to the public eye, we mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the more in&s;idious means of undermining liberty. We well know that government does not wi&s;h an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the public &s;entiment which arraigns the propriety of its mea&s;ures; and we cannot doubt that every means will
<PB N="228" REF="028389_0517_0FD8EC611B02CB80">be u&s;ed, to prevent that &s;entiment from converging to a focus; we mu&s;t, therefore, expect that every artifice, which cunning and &s;ophi&s;try can &s;ugge&s;t, will be employed to confute and confound. In&s;ulated opinions are treated with indifference; but combined ones &s;peak to the fears, as well as to the intere&s;ts of rulers, and command attention; every means will, therefore, be u&s;ed to prevent a co-operation in the people, and hence the pro&s;cription of the late town meetings.</P>
<P>From this view of the &s;ubject, fellow citizens, I am war|ranted in the inference, that town meetings, or any other meet|ings, in which the &s;en&s;e of the people can be collected, are republican and proper; and that no one will di&s;pute their pro|priety, who&s;e intere&s;t is not di&s;tinct from that of the whole people. That they &s;hould be pro&s;cribed by men who have am|bition to gratify, and other feelings to cheri&s;h, is not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing; for E&s;au &s;old his birth-right for a me&s;s of pot|tage; and Judas &s;old his ma&s;ter for thirty pieces of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>As argument fails, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to other means to make the treaty acceptable; and hence the pro&s;cription of town meetings, the calumnious epithet of Jacobin and anti-federali&s;t, and the appeals to our fears and to our affections. Artifices like the&s;e, fellow citizens, you will be on your guard again&s;t; they are de&s;igned to &s;educe your under&s;tandings and your <HI>Ame|rican</HI> feelings, which mu&s;t ever ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t an in&s;trument, abhorrent to every true friend of his country.</P>

<P>THE other part of the 11th rea&s;on is more &s;erious, and is "Becau&s;e it is &s;tipulated that neither the debts due from individuals of one nation, to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares, nor monies, which they may have in the public funds, or in any public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war or national differences, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated. It is far
<PB N="229" REF="028389_0518_0FD8EC6448FF3900">from being impo&s;&s;ible, that the exerci&s;e of this right may, in the opinion of the national legi&s;lature, contribute to pre&s;erve the peace of our country; and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation: we therefore e&s;teem it highly impolitic that the public faith &s;hould be pledged that it &s;hall ne|ver be exerci&s;ed, under any circum&s;tances whatever."</P>
<P>It will not be denied, after &s;ome little reflexion, by the inha|bitants of Bo&s;ton, that credit is of the la&s;t importance to the people of the United States. It is that which nurtured our in|fancy, which now gives &s;pring and vigour to all our exertions, public and private. Its invigorating effects have been evidenced in the hi&s;tory of the publie, and of individuals, in &s;uch &s;trong and recent colours, as to leave no doubt that we are indebted to that, for our rapid advance to wealth and importance. Let the town of Bo&s;ton be contemplated with its great and thriving commerce. Is it not mutual confidence, is it not credit that &s;upports the greate&s;t part? Con&s;ider the wealth that is flowing in upon us from every country, confided to the honor of our merchants, and the ju&s;tice of our laws&mdash;Weaken this confi|dence, wound credit but in the &s;malle&s;t degree, and you will &s;ee a thou&s;and hands, which now labour for their own emolu|ment, and the public pro&s;perity, pal&s;ied in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce an individual who would not revolt with hor|ror at the &s;ugge&s;tion, that, becau&s;e his nation was at war with the nation of his creditor, he &s;hould refu&s;e to pay what was ju&s;tly due. It is grown into a maxim, the truth of which is in|&s;tantly felt, and a&s;&s;ented to by every man of probity, that &s;o far as re&s;pects him&s;elf, no national differences ought to weaken the obligations he is under to an individual.</P>
<P>The writer of the&s;e remarks firmly believes, that there is not a citizen of Bo&s;ton who would declare, he con&s;idered him|&s;elf di&s;charged from the debt, due by him, becau&s;e there was a war between his own nation, and that of his creditor.</P>
<P>Foreign credit is the parent of dome&s;tic credit. There is no man, who will view the extent and importance of the former, but will be convinced, that an injury to that will annihilate the latter, and with it all the dome&s;tic labour and indu&s;try, origin|ating from, and &s;upported by it.</P>
<P>Do the inhabitants &s;uppo&s;e that the government would attain any thing by &s;eque&s;tering or confi&s;cating the debts of individu|als? Let them recur to their own experience of what took place the la&s;t war, when individuals were required to pay into the public trea&s;ury what was due to their ab&s;ent creditors; and they will be convinced, that in&s;tances of compliance were &s;o rare, as to leave no doubt that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w were the men who had ho|ne&s;ty
<PB N="230" REF="028389_0519_0FD8EC65C6F84958">enough to pay any one, but pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, at great hazards, to pay their creditors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to money in the public funds, the practice of nations and the authority of the mo&s;t eminent writers on pub|lic law, has, long &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce, condemned the practice of &s;eque&s;ter|ing or confi&s;cating them&mdash;and it is laid down as the acknow|ledged law, among all the modern nations, that "a &s;tate at war, does not &s;o much as touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy&mdash;Every where, in ca&s;e of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure." The policy of a conduct, in the United States, le&s;s &s;crupulous in regard to national faith and honor, may ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned. The baneful effects of war on the morals of a people, are always lamented as the greate&s;t calamity that awaits that dreadful pe&s;|tilence. Can there be any thing more de&s;tructive of that righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation, than the example &s;et by a go|vernment, of converting the confidence placed in it, by an un|&s;u&s;pecting individual, into a trap to deprive him of his proper|ty! The principle, adopted at the fountain head, would &s;oon &s;pread through all the branches, and involve in deeper di&s;tre&s;s, the unfortunate victims of war, than all the lo&s;&s;es of quiet and property. War, in its milde&s;t form, is to be deprecated as the greate&s;t evil. War, thus commenced, would be de&s;tructive of private confidence, and leave us the &s;lav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of vice and immo|rality, without character and without credit. The rea&s;on &s;tates, that "It is far from being impo&s;&s;ible that the exerci&s;e of this right may, in the opinion of the national legi&s;lature, contri|bute to pre&s;erve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation."</P>
<P>Few men who are actuated by a pure love for their country, would wi&s;h to derive its &s;afety from a conviction in the world, that it has abandoned tho&s;e principles of hone&s;ty, and regard to public and private farm, which are commonly practi&s;ed among nations.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing there are &s;uch, let them remember that our own citizens have property in other countries&mdash;that the con&s;e|quence of depriving foreigners of the confidence now entertain|ed in our laws and government, if they choo&s;e to ri&s;que their property in America, will be a payment on our part for every ri&s;que they run&mdash;that means will not be wanting by which their credits may be &s;ecreted from public gra&s;p. Let us go fur|ther, and grant that &s;u&s;picions of war with this country, could not have guarded men, thus advi&s;ed of our principles, from being en&s;nared&mdash;that we were &s;o &s;udden in commencing ho&s;ti|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, as to afford no chance of e&s;cape; and to give to this di&s;|a&s;trous
<PB N="231" REF="028389_0520_0FD8EC671A75BA38">and di&s;graceful warfare, all the effect that could po&s;&s;i|bly &s;low from it&mdash;is it probable &s;uch a mea&s;ure would prevent war, would protect the rights and property of our citizens from violation? Would not the nation thus injured, immediately make repri&s;als, long before we could build &s;hips of war to &s;up|port this &s;eizure, or call home our own defencele&s;s property. Let it be remembered, in contemplating this &s;ubject, that the nations of Europe have large &s;leets; that we are without any; that our ve&s;&s;els &s;ail unguarded, and unarmed; every moment liable to be taken, while theirs are, in many in&s;tances, protected with military force.</P>
<P>Such a principle, once adopted, temptations to war would be multiplied to a nation who&s;e intere&s;t is concerned in the cul|tivation of peace. War mu&s;t be carried on by credit, either borrowing at home or abroad. The current revenues of no country are &s;ufficient to meet the expen&s;es of war. In propor|tion to our credit, or want of it, mu&s;t we pay for the means of fighting our enemy. There can be no doubt but a war under|taken with &s;uch an oppo&s;ition to the received maxims of pub|lic faith, would be attended with difficulties and expen&s;es in the procuring of money, that would infinitely outweight any amount of property thus &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated. As little doubt can there be, that at the making of peace we &s;hould be willing to contract for the payment of property thus detained.</P>
<P>It may be fairly inferred, that no &s;uch right, as the town con|templates, exi&s;ts, according to the law of nations&mdash;that if &s;uch right did exi&s;t, it could in no ca&s;e be expedient to exerci&s;e it. But that the in&s;ertion of &s;uch an article in a treaty, &s;hould be an objection to its ratification, &s;peaks a language, which, it is &s;incerely hoped, the town, on more nature reflection, will completely di&s;card.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of the po&s;ition is more true, viz. That a con|viction on the mind of all foreigners, that the United States would in no in&s;tance, touch the credits or property of aliens, confided either to their private citizens or the public &s;aith, would contribute to pre&s;erve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and properties of the citizens from violation. The more and ab&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tely certain this was made to foreigners, with the more confidence would they place their monies and other property in our country. Be&s;ide the beneficial effects derived from this credit, is ca&s;e of any national difference or mi&s;un|der&s;tanding, there would be a large and influential part of the foreign community deeply intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving the peace of America; in protecting from violation the rights and property

<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="234" REF="028389_0522_0FD8EC6D782FAEA8">as it was called. Thus much is certain, that <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> who was the mo&s;t potent of the league, is now in clo&s;e alliance with Britain, and, of cour&s;e, would not promote the &s;y&s;tem &s;he adopt|ed the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>We have conceded no new rights; we have not &s;urrendered any principles advantageous to our&s;elves. The law &s;tands pre|ci&s;ely as it did before the treaty; and it is not probable, that the United States had any boon to offer, which could induce Britain to invert the rule, as now acknowledged by nations. When it is con&s;idered, that &s;he is at war, and we at peace&mdash; and that &s;he appears to found her greate&s;t hope of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t her enemies on her naval &s;trength, it &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that though France expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, in her treaty with the United States, that the goods of her enemies, on board our ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould be free, yet, in many in&s;tances, &s;he has cho&s;en to &s;werve from this &s;tipulation, and capture and confi&s;cate the property of her enemy on board our &s;hips.</P>
<P>The words of the rea&s;on, that the treaty "precludes the hope of receiving any advantage," &amp;c. (if the principle before mentioned is what the town alludes to) extend further than is warranted by the treaty; for, in that in&s;truments, there is the following &s;tipulation&mdash;"The &s;aid parties will al&s;o renew their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, <HI>and endeavour to agree,</HI> whether in any, and in what ca&s;es, neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall protect enemies' property." It can hardly be &s;aid, that a treaty "precludes all hope" of a benefit, when the parties have expre&s;sly contracted to renew a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion thereon, and endeavour to agree in what ca&s;es it &s;hall be made.</P>
<P>The 16th rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e it not only &s;urrenders the right of carrying the property of any nation at war with Great Britain, in our ve&s;&s;els freely, but abandons all preten&s;ions even to the freight."</P>
<P>It has been &s;hown, in the remarks on the 15th rea&s;on, that we have no right, by the law of nations, to carry the property of a nation at war with Great Britain, free from &s;eizure. If, therefore, the treaty expre&s;sly recognizes the principle, that enemy's property is liable to confi&s;cation, though on board the ve&s;&s;el of a friend, it does no more than the government has done before. It &s;urrenders no right; for no right thus to protect enemics' goods, exi&s;ts between us and Great Britain.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on further &s;tates, "That the treaty abandons all preten&s;ions even to freight."</P>
<P>The writer of the&s;e remarks has looked, with attention, through the treaty, to find the clau&s;e on which this a&s;&s;ertion
<PB N="235" REF="028389_0523_0FD8EC700A2B2640">is made; he can really find none that will &s;upport it. "Effects belonging to an enemy, found on board a neutral &s;hip, are &s;eizable by the rights of war; but, by the law of nature, the ma&s;ter is to be paid his freight, and not to &s;uffer by the &s;eiz|ure." There is nothing in the treaty to controvert this princi|ple, declared by <HI>Vattel.</HI> It cannot be doubted, that in all ca&s;es, where, prior to the ratification of the treaty, freight is paya|ble for goods of an enemy to Britain, found on board of an American ve&s;&s;el, the &s;ame will be equally payable, when the treaty is ratified, if that event &s;hould take place. For there is nothing in the treaty, that can imply a relinqui&s;hment of our rights, by the law of nations, much le&s;s an abandon|ment of all preten&s;ions to freight, in &s;uch ca&s;es. In the latter part of the 17th article of the treaty, there is an expre&s;s agreement to pay freight, where, by law, it could not be de|manded.</P>
<P>The 17th rea&s;on is, "Becau&s;e it permits the Briti&s;h nation to convert provi&s;ions, de&s;tined to other nations at war with them, to their own u&s;e, on payment of what they may deem a rea&s;onable profit; a mea&s;ure not only injurious to the intere&s;ts of the American merchant, but which will prevent our citi|zens from carrying tho&s;e &s;upplies to other countries, which, by the laws of nature and nations, they have a right to do, without mole&s;tation."</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, that the town, in this rea&s;on, refers to the 17th article of the treaty. An examination of that article will &s;how, that the town has mi&s;taken its import; and that, in&s;tead of &s;urrendering a right, it acquires one, to which we are not entitled, unle&s;s the treaty is ratified. All writers on the law of nations agree, that there are ca&s;es, in which provi&s;ions are contraband; though it would &s;eem, by the generality of the expre&s;&s;ions of the town, in the la&s;t paragraph of this rea&s;on, that there is a right to carry &s;upplies, in all ca&s;es, without mole&s;tation. It can hardly be believed, that this was the mean|ing of the town; yet, if any &s;hould think thus, they may have the con&s;olation to reflect, that there is nothing in this treaty, that prevents an endeavour to &s;upport &s;uch a propo&s;ition&mdash; the words being, "where, by <HI>the exi&s;ting law of nations,</HI> they are contraband." Now, if there is no ca&s;e, where, by the law of nations, they are contraband, then there is no right to &s;eize them under that article.</P>
<P>The article in the treaty, &s;tates, "That whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the preci&s;e ca&s;es, in which alone, provi&s;ions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be regarded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniencies
<PB N="236" REF="028389_0524_0FD8EC73EED019B0">and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e: It is further agreed, that whenever any &s;uch article, &s;o becoming contra|band, according to the exi&s;ting law of nations, &s;hall for that rea&s;on be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be confi&s;cated, but the own|ers thereof &s;hall be &s;peedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or, in their default, the government under who&s;e authority they act, &s;hall pay the full value of all articles, with a rea&s;onable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and al&s;o the demurrage incident to &s;uch detention." Hence it is clear, that the treaty does not give any new right to the Bri|ti&s;h nation; it does not permit the taking provi&s;ions, &amp;c. in any ca&s;e where &s;he is not authorized by the law of nations&mdash;it permits the taking them only where, by the <HI>exi&s;ting law of na|tions, they are contraband.</HI> Here is no cau&s;e of complaint.&mdash; The other part of the article is a po&s;itive advantage to the na|tion at peace; for it expre&s;sly contracts to pay for &s;uch provi|&s;ions, where, by law, the nation &s;eizing them would be under no obligation to pay, viz. in ca&s;es, where, by the exi&s;ting law of nations, they are contraband; and in no other ca&s;e are they &s;eizable by treaty. The article goes further; it not only &s;tipu|lates for payment, but for complete and &s;peedy indemnifica|tion, rea&s;onable profits, freight and demurrage, and that the government &s;hall pay, if the individual captors &s;hall &s;ail. It is injurious to the intere&s;t of the American merchant, that, in ca&s;es where his property is, by the law of nations, ju&s;tly for|feited, the treaty &s;ecures to him full and complete indemnifi|cation, payment with profit, freight and demurrage? Will our citizens be prevented from carrying &s;upplies to other countries, becau&s;e the hazards are le&s;&s;ened&mdash;becau&s;e, in every event, they are &s;ure of making a good voyage? Surely the an&s;wers will con|tradict the rea&s;ons of the town.</P>
<P>The 18th rea&s;on given by the town, is, "Becau&s;e it limits the power of congre&s;s, delegated to them by the con&s;titution, to regulate our commerce with foreign nations, by pre&s;cribing conditions, and creating impediments to the exerci&s;e of that power."</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, in the di&s;tribution of powers, as completely ve&s;ts the powers delegated to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, as it ve&s;ts tho&s;e it delegates to congre&s;s. The pre&s;ident has power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties; when, therefore, he thus makes a treaty, it is as much an act of the whole people of the United States, as any law of congre&s;s. Is he limited as to the kind of trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> he &s;hall make? There is no limitation in the con&s;titution. But then it is &s;aid, "Congre&s;s has a right to regulate commerce with foreign
<PB N="237" REF="028389_0525_0FD8EC7549A49CD8">nations; and, as this treaty regulates commerce with a foreign na|tion, it limits the power of congre&s;s;" and &s;uppo&s;e it does, if it is a con&s;titutional act, the limitation is as legal, as though the con|&s;titution had declared in expre&s;s terms, that congre&s;s &s;hould have a right to regulate commerce, where it was not otherwi&s;e regulated by treaty. Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that the con&s;titu|tion intended &s;uch treaties, as did not interfere with the pow|ers delegated to congre&s;s. The inference, from this con&s;truc|tion, would be, that no commercial treaty could ever be made; and, looking at the powers of congre&s;s, it will be doubtful if any other treaty can be made, or if the United States can make any treaty&mdash;for congre&s;s has no power to make a treaty&mdash;and if the pre&s;ident, who, with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;e|nate, is alone authorized to make treaties, can make no treaty, which re&s;pects any of the powers, ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, there is no man or body of men authorized to treat with foreign na|tions.</P>
<P>Treaties, generally &s;peaking, are mere treaties of peace, or treaties of commerce; congre&s;s has power to make war, grant letters of marque and repri&s;al. If the pre&s;ident with con&s;ent of the &s;enate, makes a treaty of peace, according to the rea&s;oning of the town, he limits the power of congre&s;s, which has au|thority to make war, and in the treaty &s;poken of there is a &s;tipulation, that there &s;hall be a firm and inviolable peace be|tween the parties&mdash;It is equally objectionable on this ground, as on that of regulating commerce. If the United States &s;hould be at war with any nation, on &s;uch con&s;truction, they mu&s;t remain eternally at war&mdash;congre&s;s has declared war&mdash;has done an act which that body alone had a right to do; the pre&s;ident, by making peace, does not barely limit a power to act; but does that which is in direct violation of an act con&s;titutionally done by congre&s;s, and operates as an ab&s;olute repeal of their declaration of war. Such a con&s;truction of the con&s;titution is not to be admitted.</P>
<P>We ought never to admit a con&s;truction of any in&s;trument, which leads to an ab&s;urdity, or to the de&s;truction of any part; we ought to reconcile all parts thereof, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o that every portion of it may take effect, and no word but what may ope|rate in &s;ome &s;hape or other. Let us endeavour to con&s;true this in&s;trument by the&s;e rules:&mdash;The pre&s;ident, with the advi&s;e and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, makes a treaty of peace with a nation, with whom the United States are at war. He has done an act which he thought wi&s;e; the next or the &s;ame day, congre&s;s receives &s;uch information, as, in their opinion, renders it ex|pedient to declare war. This militates with what was done;
<PB N="238" REF="028389_0526_0FD8EC7A944C8C68">but it by no means follows that either was wrong; or that the con&s;titutional power of either was limited by their con&s;titutional acts. Both have exerci&s;ed that power which each had a right to exerci&s;e. The &s;tate of war was complete until the pre&s;ident made peace; and the &s;tate of peace, the true and legal &s;tate, until congre&s;s declared war, which repealed the doings of the pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>In a treaty of commerce, it is contracted, that duties &s;hall be no higher than at pre&s;ent. Afterwards congre&s;s choo&s;es to impo&s;e higher duties, and actually does impo&s;e higher than is &s;ti|pulated in the treaty. The treaty is contravened, and the nation mu&s;t abide the good or evil con&s;equences that flow from the mea&s;ure, in like manner as it would, if congre&s;s &s;hould choo&s;e to declare war, and annul an article which declares, there &s;hall be a perpetual peace, as is the ca&s;e in &s;ome treaties. If this con&s;truction is right, there can be no limitation, even in terms, of the power of congre&s;s, e&s;pecially when it is recollected, that a bare majority of both hou&s;es, with the pre&s;ident, is &s;uf|ficient to pa&s;s a law, while two-thirds of the &s;enate is nece&s;&s;ary to make a treaty. But &s;uppo&s;e any doubt this con&s;truction, and in the ca&s;e of an impo&s;ition of higher duties than is &s;tipulated by the treaty, the party, con&s;idering him&s;elf injured by the law, refu&s;es to pay; a &s;uit is commenced, and the cau&s;e, in the la&s;t in&s;tance, is decided by the &s;upreme judicial court, who are authorized to determine whether &s;uch an act be, or not, conformable to the con&s;titution. If the act of congre&s;s is de|termined to be uncon&s;titutional, the treaty could not be called a limitation of the power ve&s;ted in them by the con&s;titution; &s;ince it appears that the con&s;titution did not ve&s;t in congre&s;s a power to make &s;uch act. Therefore, in no ca&s;e, can the treaty be called a <HI>"a limitation of the power of congre&s;s, delegated is them by the con&s;titution."</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing has been attempted to obviate the objection of the town as &s;tated, and to &s;how that there can, neither in fact nor terms, be any limitation to the powers ve&s;ted in congre&s;s&mdash; In the opinion of this writer, there is a &s;hort, but equally &s;atis|factory an&s;wer to tho&s;e who fear a real interference in the de|partments of government, from the wording of the con&s;titu|tion. &mdash;The people of the United States were well aware, that there were two modes of regulating commerce&mdash;one by treaty, where nations are di&s;po&s;ed to treat on terms beneficial to each other; the other, where nations are unwilling thus to treat, by laws con&s;titutionally made.&mdash;Under this impre&s;&s;ion they framed their con&s;titution.&mdash;If nations are unwilling to treat with the United States on the rights of commerce, or we are unwilling
<PB N="239" REF="028389_0527_0FD8EC7A96931550">to treat with them, congre&s;s is the con&s;titutional body to make laws, regulating the commerce between them and us.&mdash;If na|tions are willing to treat on their and our commercial relations commercial nations, all of whom will probably regulate our trade by this partial &s;tandard."</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered, that we are under no obligation to make other treaties, becau&s;e we have made this; and if, in the cour&s;e of two years, from a ce&s;&s;ation of the war in which Great Britain is now engaged, it &s;hould appear to be injurious to us, we can drop all its load of commercial burdens, and embarra&s;&s;ments.&mdash;It might have been well in the town to have &s;tated the peculiar embarra&s;&s;ments the treaty impo&s;es upon us, and which are to be avoided by its de&s;truction. It &s;urrenders no rights we now enjoy, but grants &s;ome we had not before, and renders ab&s;olute what was before precarious. Our other treaties admit us to trade in Europe, as the mo&s;t favored nations. The treaty with Great Britain does the &s;ame. It al&s;o admits us into their Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements, and their colonies on the continent of North America, to trade with them on terms highly favora|ble to our commerce. No other nation has granted to us like advantages. The treaty with France admits us into certain free ports in the We&s;t Indies, under regulations not mentioned in the treaty, but varying according to the will of the ruling power.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rea&s;on, is, "Becau&s;e, in the opinion of the inhabi|tants of this town, the nature and extent of the exports of the United States are &s;uch, that in all their &s;tipulations with foreign nations, they have it in their power to &s;ecure a perfect reciprocity of intercour&s;e, not only with the home dominions of &s;uch nations, but with all their colonial dependencies."</P>
<P>It is not wonderful, that the town of Bo&s;ton &s;hould violently oppo&s;e the treaty, if &s;uch be their opinion; but then they &s;hould equally wi&s;h for the annulling of all the exi&s;ting treaties. &mdash;Re&s;trictions and regulations &s;hould be impo&s;ed on all foreign commerce, till tho&s;e treaties are de&s;troyed, or &s;uch trade can be obtained. But as the town has not cho&s;en to give their rea&s;ons for this opinion, it is not impo&s;&s;ible the pre&s;ident may tru&s;t to the experience of the United States, from the treaties already made, and his own knowledge of the temper of foreign powers

<P>THE fir&s;t number of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, in an&s;wer to the Federali&s;t, expre&s;&s;es his fears of the danger that may ari&s;e, from the &s;malle&s;t branch of the legi&s;lature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power to make treaties, independent of the larger. This remark is aimed again&s;t the con&s;titution, that if it has no other effect, it may prepare the mind of the reader for his con&s;truction: which, if true, will be a death blow to the treaty, and end all conte&s;t on account of its expediency. The town, on being con|vinced of this, may remain quiet and undi&s;turbed; for if made by people who have no power, it can never be a law&mdash;it, is a mere dead letter.</P>
<P>After quoting various pa&s;&s;ages of the con&s;titution, which de&s;cribes the powers of congre&s;s, he con&s;iders it as clear, that no treaty can be made, in which the organ authorized, by the con&s;titution, to make treaties, &s;hall exerci&s;e any of, tho&s;e pow|ers. The con&s;titution would, according to this writer, read thus&mdash;The pre&s;ident, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, &s;hall have power to make treaties, provided two thirds of the &s;enate concur; and provided always, that &s;uch treaties do not relate to peace or war, that they do not regulate com|merce with foreign nations&mdash;and that they do not provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States.</P>
<P>It would be &s;trange, if the people of America had made &s;uch a con&s;titution, as prevented them from any negociation with foreign powers&mdash;on &s;uch con&s;truction, this would be the ca&s;e. The pre&s;ident and &s;enate are the only body empowered to make treatin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and, according to this rea&s;oning, their power is &s;o re&s;trained, that it can never be exerci&s;ed on &s;uch &s;ubjects, as nations treat upon. The mere &s;tating the con&s;equences of &s;uch con&s;truction, is &s;ufficient to &s;how its ab&s;urdity; and to convince any rea&s;onable man, that it originated in no regard to the con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Does it follow, becau&s;e the con&s;titution ve&s;ts a power in two bodies to do an act, that the exerci&s;e of &s;uch power by either will be wrong? If by either, then both&mdash;and the power is void. If commerce cannot be regulated by treaty with foreign nations, becau&s;e a power to regulate commerce is given to congre&s;s;
<PB N="241" REF="028389_0529_0FD8EC7D039D7DC8">then congre&s;s cannot regulate commerce, becau&s;e the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have power to make treaties, in which is undoubt|edly included a power to regulate commerce with foreign na|tions.</P>
<P>The people of the United States, as has been el&s;ewhere re|marked, willing to provide for the two common methods of regulating commerce, viz. by legi&s;lative acts, and by treaties, appointed congre&s;s to make laws where tho&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary; and the pre&s;ident, with con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties where that method was attainable, and thought mo&s;t beneficial. The power, ve&s;ted in this latter organ of the people, is as full and complete, as that of making laws in the ordinary mode of legi&s;lation, is in the other.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom and caution of the people, is, in no in&s;tance-more &s;ignally di&s;played than in thus ve&s;ting a power to make treaties. Promptitude in &s;eizing the fitte&s;t occa&s;ion, &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, are often nece&s;&s;ary in the forming of treaties. Such qualifications are not be found in large bodies. Hence the wi&s;|dom of ve&s;ting a power of negociation in the pre&s;ident. To avoid too great ha&s;te, imprudence, or want of knowledge, which might ari&s;e from an individual, the people appointed the &s;enate (two-thirds of which mu&s;t concur) to weigh and di&s;cu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the merits of a treaty, and &s;anction it with their approbation, before the pre&s;ident can render it obligatory on the United. States.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered, that the &s;enate will ever be compo&s;ed of &s;ome, who have been of that department, nearly &s;ix year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at lea&s;t, their knowledge of the laws of the United States, of its foreign and dome&s;tic relations, of the &s;tate of its commerce, and what regulations will mo&s;t advance its pro&s;perity, cannot be que&s;tioned. The&s;e qualifications render that body pre-eminently &s;it for the duty of advi&s;ing the pre&s;ident, in his negociations, with foreign powers. The &s;ecrecy u&s;ed in &s;uch affairs, and which is &s;o bitterly exclaimed again&s;t by this writer, is indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the people. It avoids the violent oppo&s;ition, which ari&s;es from the influence and intrigue of foreigners, or of tho&s;e who prefer the intere&s;t of a foreign nation to the intere&s;t of their own. The people appointed the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to regulate their affairs with foreign nations, and neither directed, nor authorized them to take the advice of any man or body of men. To have commu|nicated their tran&s;actions while in train, would have been to hazard the intere&s;t of the people; and &s;uch a breach of tru&s;t as to have ju&s;tly expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the &s;evere reprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e for whom they acted.</P>

Under the confederation, the powers of congre&s;s were not greater on this &s;ubject, than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution. Congre&s;s then made treaties of alliance and commerce. The treaties were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and rati|fied in &s;ecret. If it had been otherwi&s;e, the peace, happine&s;s, and independence of the country might have been greatly en|dangered. Does any one believe, that the court of France would have negociated with our mini&s;ters, if they had &s;uppo&s;ed the negociation would in&s;tantly be made public&mdash;and that after a treaty was formed, in&s;tead of being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in congre&s;s, it was to combat all the a&s;&s;aults of foreign influence in the cities of America?</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that had it not been for the <HI>&s;ecrecy,</HI> as well as the con&s;ummate &s;kill and firmne&s;s of Mr. Jay and Mr. Adams, foreign influence would have prevented the explicit acknowledgment of our independence by Great Britain, and our right to the fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>In the important treaties, negociated and ratified under the confederation, there never was a li&s;p again&s;t them, becau&s;e they were tran&s;acted in &s;ecret. The people knew that their rights depended on this mode of conducting &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s; and no one was hardy enough, then, to interfere with the e&s;&s;ential rights of the people. Let tho&s;e who clamour at the pre&s;ident and &s;enate for doing the bu&s;ine&s;s entru&s;ted to them, in the man|ner which the experience of all nations, e&s;pecially of the United States, has &s;tamped as alone &s;afe and wi&s;e, &s;how that foreign influence and dome&s;tic intrigue is le&s;s to be apprehended now than formerly&mdash;that the people's rights will be better con|ducted by them, than by tho&s;e whom the people have cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The objection to the treaty, becau&s;e the pre&s;ident and &s;enate had no power to make &s;uch, will appear &s;till more extraordi|nary, when it is remembered that the whole ground of bring|ing forward the commercial re&s;olutions, by Mr. Madi&s;on, the winter before la&s;t&mdash;of their recommendation by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was to induce Great Britain to make a treaty with the United States. The re&s;olutions were to apply only to nations, who had no commercial treaty with the United States; and they were &s;upported again&s;t Great Britain, becau&s;e it was &s;aid &s;he would make no treaty with us. Both parties then agreed, that if commerce was regulated by treaty, it was out of their power; and the &s;upporters of the re&s;olutions advocated them, on the probability of their forcing Great Britain to re|gulate commerce by treaty. But if they had been ble&s;t with half the logic of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, they would have &s;een that it was wrong and in&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ous in the pre&s;ident, to have di|rected

The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives (whom this writer &s;eems to have mi&s;taken for congre&s;s, &s;peaking of the &s;enate's con&s;enting to a ratification of the treaty, he &s;ays, <HI>"a&s;&s;umes powers con&s;titutionally ve&s;ted in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives"</HI>) in&s;tead of debating whether or not it was the intention of the Briti&s;h nation, to treat with us on commerce, &s;hould have addre&s;&s;ed the executive on the in&s;idious conduct of demanding powers from a man, authorizing him to treat, and propo&s;ing to him to negociate on &s;ubjects, on which they them&s;elves were not authorized to treat.</P>
<P>A particular objection is made to the 6th article of the in|&s;trument, becau&s;e it &s;tipulates for the payment of certain Bri|ti&s;h debts; to execute which &s;tipulation, it will be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, or exci&s;es. &mdash;It is doubtle&s;s true, that congre&s;s mu&s;t lay and collect taxes to make this payment, if the treaty is ratified. The pre&s;ident and &s;enate have done what they thought ju&s;t and right; and it remains for congre&s;s to do what is nece&s;&s;ary on their part, to fulfil the engagements of the United States.&mdash;"Congre&s;s is to pay the debts, and provide for the general welfare of the United States." And no good man can doubt, but that body will do what their duty directs. It is true, congre&s;s may refu&s;e to do this&mdash;&s;o they might refu&s;e to pa&s;s any laws; but it is not a &s;uppo&s;eable ca&s;e. The con&s;titution is framed on the idea that every part of the government will do that, which it is authorized to do for the public good. What is to become of our unhappy fellow citizens in Algiers, if the doctrine advanced here is true? Congre&s;s cannot make a treaty for their redemption; becau&s;e congre&s;s cannot make any treaty. The pre&s;ident can make none for their redemption; becau&s;e he mu&s;t incur a debt to the United States, and to pay that debt, it may be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to lay and collect taxes. What a nervele&s;s arm do the&s;e people give to the con&s;titution! Under a pretence of &s;upport|ing it, they de&s;troy the power of the nation, and the liberties of their fellow citizens.</P>

The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, the Federali&s;t was incorrect in his &s;tatement of the occurrences of the meeting; but does not even hint in what he was incorrect, unle&s;s it be in the &s;tate|ment made of the publication of the treaty prior to the meet|ing.

In the copy of Mr. Ma&s;on, it is not &s;o. The United States are to refund <HI>only</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es, where they forbore to u&s;e all the means in their power to obtain re&s;titution. In the counterpart, as it is called, 9th article&mdash;"The &s;ubjects and citizens of the contracting parties &s;hall hold real e&s;tate in each others territories, with the &s;ame advantages as the citizens and &s;ubjects of the re&s;pective &s;tates." This is gro&s;sly wrong, and well known to have cau&s;ed much of the zeal excited again&s;t the treaty. In the treaty, the holding of lands is limited merely to tho&s;e who <HI>now</HI> hold lands, their heirs and a&s;&s;igns. In the 13th article of this &s;uppo&s;ed counterpart, it is &s;aid, that we can carry nothing that we ex|port from the Ea&s;t Indies, to any country but the United States, and that we cannot partake of the India carrying trade. This was an article that gave more umbrage to the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton than any other.</P>
<P>By in&s;pecting Mr. Ma&s;on's copy, it appears, that the goods exported from Ea&s;t India are to be carried to America; that we have an expre&s;s &s;tipulation for a direct trade to and from India; that we are perfectly free to export from America, to any part of the world, the goods we import from India; that the coa&s;ting trade, and the trade from India to other parts of the world, re&s;t on preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;ooting as they did before, except that which is &s;tipulated in another article, that they will
<PB N="245" REF="028389_0533_0FD8EC899AB2AFB0">not refu&s;e to us any privileges in the trade which they may grant to other nations.</P>
<P>In this counterpart, it is &s;tated, under the 13th article, "As it is difficult to determine the ca&s;es in which provi&s;ions carried to an enemy are contraband; to avoid di&s;pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;hould &s;uch provi&s;ions be &s;eized, the owners &s;hall be paid for them, al&s;o their freight, &amp;c. and a rea&s;onable mer|cantile pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">."</P>
<P>By an examination of the article in Mr. Ma&s;on's copy, it appears, that provi&s;ions are never to be &s;eized, but in ca&s;es where, by the exi&s;ting law of nations, they are contraband, and even then they are paid for. In the one ca&s;e, it was a ma|nife&s;t giving up of rights, now enjoyed, of carrying provi&s;ions; while, by the accurate copy, it is a clear and decided advan|tage to our citizens: &s;tipulating for payment of freight, profit, and demurrage, in ca&s;es where, by the law of nations, we had forfeited all claim to any thing. Can it be &s;aid that the Federali&s;t was wrong in &s;tating, that this counterpart was in|correct?</P>
<P>It is conceded by the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>this counterpart</HI> was what the inhabitants of the town had read and con&s;ulted, previous to their meeting, and that the preparatory &s;teps to the town meeting were totally unconnected with Mr. Ma&s;on's copy of the treaty&mdash;This confirms what the Federali&s;t had &s;ugge&s;ted, and &s;ully accounts for the warmth that was &s;o vi&s;i|ble again&s;t the treaty. If, preparatory to the meeting, the real copy had been read and con&s;ulted on, there is little rea&s;on to doubt, that a majority of the inhabitants would have been well &s;atisfied with it,&mdash;The Con&s;titutionali&s;t need not di&s;cover his anger, at an imputation, that Mr. Bache excited the pa|trioti&s;m of the petitioners for the town meeting. It was not even hinted by the Federali&s;t. They are perfectly welcome to the whole merit of the thing and to the reputation of their &s;pirited re&s;entment again&s;t the treaty, before they had reed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; as the Con&s;titutionali&s;t declares, that &s;ome days before the arri|val of Mr. Ma&s;on's copy, they had drawn their petition for a town meeting.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, the committee could not know what the two mini&s;ters, while in the act of forming the treaty, brought into con&s;ideration; and, therefore, could not have intended, in the objection, the a&s;&s;ertion with which the Fe|derali&s;t charges them. The Federali&s;t did not charge the com|mittee with knowing what the two mini&s;ters brought into con|&s;ideration&mdash;He &s;ays, they a&s;&s;umed a fact for which they did not choo&s;e to give any evidence. He gave in his opinion, that they
<PB N="246" REF="028389_0534_0FD8EC8F9F218F08">did not know; if they did, it would have been &s;tated as the. Federali&s;t pre&s;umes.</P>
<P>The Federali&s;t then concluded, that the committee meant, by the words, <HI>brought into con&s;ideration,</HI> that they were not the &s;ubject of negociation; that &s;uch is certainly the natural mean|ing of the terms; and it was evidently the de&s;ign of the com|mittee then; becau&s;e they go on and &s;tate, as objections to the treaty it&s;elf, their complaints not being provided for; and nobody could be &s;o uncandid as to believe, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they endea|voured to &s;tretch their objections into many articles, intending the &s;ame thing, until the explanation made by the Con&s;tituti|onali&s;t. He now &s;ays, that all the evidence the committee had, on this &s;ubject, is derived from the&s;e complaints and preten|&s;ions not being mentioned in the treaty it&s;elf. Then they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> two charges on the &s;ame &s;ubject: 1&s;t. We object to the weary, becau&s;e our complaints have not been con&s;idered, by which we mean, provided for and allowed; for the Can&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, the committee did not know what pa&s;&s;ed in the negoti|ation; and 2dly, We object to the treaty, becau&s;e our con|plaints are not provided for and allowed; or el&s;e the charge is, that the con&s;ideration did not appear in the treaty, that it, that the whole negotiation old not make a part of the treaty&mdash;this la&s;t would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ab&s;urd to impute to any body.</P>
<P>Until the Con&s;titutionali&s;t had &s;tated, that the and objection was not of a &s;ufficient weight to prevent the ratification of the treaty, it was really &s;uppo&s;ed, that the town meant each of their rea&s;ons as a &s;upport of their general charge again&s;t the treaty, for being derogatory to national honor, &amp;c. &amp;c. but a &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s now, that the &s;econd objection was only part of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;on, whether half a rea&s;on, a 10th or 20th pars of a rea&s;on, we are not informed&mdash;po&s;&s;ibly the 20th p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">; the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> objections forming one rea&s;on &s;ufficiently important to prevent ratification; if this be the ea&s;e, and the &s;malle&s;t part fails, the objection to its ratification falls.

<PB N="247" REF="028389_0535_0FD8EC934B5225C8">them, would have quietly given up fourteen millions of dollars, for one million. In an&s;wer to an ob&s;ervation made by the Federali&s;t, that damages for detention of territories were rarely, if ever given, after long and expen&s;ive wars, terminating in favor of the party di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; it is &s;aid, that &s;uch is the magnanimity of conquering nations, that they are willing to take the territory demanded, without in&s;i&s;ting on any damages.

<P>THE Federali&s;t, in his remarks on the third rea&s;on of the town, did not mean to &s;tate the rea&s;oning of the Briti&s;h, on the 7th article of the treaty of 1783, as in his opinion, conclu&s;ive again&s;t the demand of the American mini&s;ter, for the value of negroes embarked from New York, and &s;uppo&s;ed formerly to have been the property of Americans. In tho&s;e ob&s;ervations he gave no opinion. The weight of the reply by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, mu&s;t ever depend on its own intrin&s;ic me|rit &mdash;and every candid American will give to it, all due force. The Federali&s;t &s;tated, that, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was not &s;uppo&s;eable, the Briti&s;h nation would recede from their con&s;truction. If that was to be pre&s;umed, the agent for Ame|rica ought not to have adhered to his, as a point indi&s;penfible; becau&s;e, by breaking off all negociation on that account, be gave up the forts; he gave up all indemnification for our pro|perty captured on the ocean, and al&s;o the commercial advan|tages of the treaty.</P>
<P>The merchants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts will con&s;ider, if they are willing to &s;urrender all claim to their property captured by the Briti&s;h&mdash;to &s;addle them&s;elves with an Indian war, at the annu|al expen&s;e of a million of dollars, in a vain attempt, to gain,
<PB N="248" REF="028389_0536_0FD8EC9530CE9930">by force, indemnity for a few &s;laves, once the property of their &s;outhern brethren.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, "That after a communication of the treaty to the Briti&s;h general, every &s;pecies of the property of the American inhabitants, ought to have been held &s;acred; yet, in the &s;ucceeding month, a large number of negroes did embark for the Briti&s;h provinces." It may be true, that a num|ber of negroes did embark for the Briti&s;h provinces; but it by no means follows they were American property.</P>
<P>It is agreed, that all the negroes which were embarked, were found in New York, by Sir Guy Carl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton, and that he arrived there during the war. It is not pretended, that any negroes were taken from their proper ma&s;ters, or from any parts of the United States, under the controul of the American government after the receipt of the treaty, by the Briti&s;h generals. Tho&s;e negroes were either property, or they were free people. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> property, they were as liable to be lo&s;t and acquired by the rights of war, as any other property. It is not di&s;puted, that the negroes which embarked from New York, were either captured in war, or invited by a proclamation, declaring they &s;hould be free on acceptance of the terms therein proffered. Had the &s;outhern gentlemen any more right, under the treaty of 1783, to claim negroes of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, than the New England men, their ve&s;&s;els, or other goods, taken during the war? They were both equally property in the view of a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ern merchant. Human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n fle&s;h, provided it is black, and a &s;hip, are held in the &s;ame light by &s;lave-holders, differing only as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their value in the market.&mdash;If captured during war, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not the propeaty completely changed? It was in a ve&s;&s;el; why not then equally &s;o with a &s;lave, which was as much property as a ve&s;&s;el? The Con&s;titutionali&s;t is de&s;ired to point out the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ence if there be any.</P>
<P>The other cla&s;s was compo&s;ed of &s;uch, as induced by the Briti&s;h proclamation, had left their ma&s;ters, and withdrawn them&s;elves into the Briti&s;h lines. It will not be denied, that this is a rightful mode of depriving an enemy of property. Af|ter they had arrived within the Briti&s;h lines, it will not be contended, that the Briti&s;h could deliver them up, without a manife&s;t breach of faith. They had cea&s;ed to be American property, as much as a ve&s;&s;el that had drifted from a port in the United States, into a port of the Briti&s;h. Had then the &s;outhern citizens any more claim for the&s;e negroes, than the New England men for their ve&s;&s;els, drifted from their own, into the port of their enemy? The &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to both, and appears ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="028389_0537_0FD8EC964CD38DD8">
Such has been &s;aid to be the rea&s;oning of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter in an&s;wer to Mr. Jay's repeated applications on this &s;ubject. Be|fore Mr. Jay is blamed for not obtaining payment for the negroes, or the &s;enate for con&s;enting to the treaty, though &s;ilent on this &s;ubject, tho&s;e who affect to &s;ay that the treaty &s;hould not be ratified unle&s;s compen&s;ation is made, ought to give it a &s;atisfac|tory an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that Sir Guy Carleton was charged by Gene|ral Wa&s;hington, with having violated the treaty, in &s;uffering the embarkation of negroes; that he acknowledged the truth of the charge, by his precautions in a&s;certaining the number, and thereby gave an indirect opinion that re&s;titution &s;hould be made for them. The mere a&s;certaining the number cannot &s;up|port this con&s;truction. It is equal evidence, that, in his opini|on, no claim for re&s;titution could be maintained. Could h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an officer of the Briti&s;h crown, con&s;i&s;tently with any of the principles on which men generally act, violate the treaty, and, at the &s;ame moment, give to the complaining party, evidence of the violation, when fully within his power to have refu&s;ed it? It is not pre&s;umeable. Examine the words of his letter; and it will appear that he did not admit the po&s;&s;ibility of a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter having made a treaty, that bears &s;uch a con|&s;truction. They are as follow, viz. "The negroes in que&s;ti|on, I have already &s;aid, I found free when I arrived at New York; I had therefore no right, as I thought, to prevent their going to any part of the world they thought proper.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by General Wa&s;hington, to &s;uperintend the embarkation from New York, and &s;ee that no American property was carried away, at the clo&s;e of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, make report to him of their doings, wherein they &s;ay: "Sir Guy Carleton affected to di&s;tingui&s;h between the ca&s;es of &s;uch negroes as came within the Briti&s;h lines, in con&s;equence of the promi&s;es of freedom and indemnity, held out in the

<P>In the treaty of peace made between France and Great Bri|tain in 1783, it is &s;tipulated, that the deci&s;ion of the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and &s;eizures made prior to the ho&s;tilities, &s;hall be referred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;pective courts of ju&s;tice: &s;o that the legality of the &s;aid prizes and &s;eizures be decided according to the laws of nations, and to treaties, in the courts of ju&s;tice of the nation which &s;hall have made the capture, or ordered the &s;eizure.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that after long and expen&s;ive war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the mo&s;t powerful nations on the globe, this mode of trial and obtain|ing compen&s;ation for &s;eizures made in time of peace, was con&s;idered right, and acquie&s;ced in. It is not, therefore, proba|ble, that after immen&s;e expen&s;e of blood and trea&s;ure in a war with England, if &s;ucce&s;sful, we &s;hould obtain better terms. Is it not wi&s;e, then, to accept that with peace, which, in the

<P>He attempts to derive force to the rea&s;on of the town by &s;aying that the United States have agreed to a more &s;ummary mode of trial of the Briti&s;h claims; and as an equivalent, they &s;hould have granted a like mode. A little attention to the cau&s;es of complaint on the part of the Briti&s;h, will &s;how, that a deter|mination by commi&s;&s;ion will only take place, where it is impo&s;|&s;ible for the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings to reach the evil.&mdash;Fir&s;t, The Briti&s;h debts due in 1783. The treaty authorizes commi&s;&s;ioners to take cognizance only of &s;uch debts as where, by the operation of various impediments, created by law, Briti&s;h creditors have been prevented from obtaining ju&s;tice, and where judicial courts connot <HI>now</HI> procure them compen&s;ation. If they can obtain ju&s;tice in the courts of law, they are obliged to re&s;ort there. The commi&s;&s;ioners cannot &s;u&s;tain their complaints. It e&s;tabli&s;hes this &s;ummary mode to compen&s;ate for lo&s;&s;es, occa&s;ioned by our not permitting Briti&s;h creditors to have the advantage of the laws of the land, which was expre&s;sly &s;tipulated in the treaty of peace. For redre&s;s of our complaints, the courts are open, and what we cannot ob|tain in this way, &s;hall be made up to us by commi&s;&s;ioners. Surely it will not be &s;aid, that we have agreed to a more &s;um|mary mode of trial for Briti&s;h complaints, than they have for American complaints.</P>
<P>The other ground of complaint on the part of the Briti&s;h, is in permitting their ve&s;&s;els to be taken in our ports, or by pri|vateers fitted out in our harbours; and forbearing, for particu|lar rea&s;ons, to make u&s;e of all the means in our power to pre|vent their being captured, or to obtain re&s;titution when cap|tured. It is well remembered what the particular rea&s;ons were&mdash;A foreigner, intent on involving our country in a war, and &s;upported by an unprincipled faction of Americans, created &s;uch a ferment as rendered it hazardous to attempt executing the laws.</P>
<P>The government forbore to afford them ju&s;tice in our courts, at that time. It cannot now; tho&s;e who then in&s;ulted the &s;ove|reignty of our country are fled, and have taken the property with them&mdash;It would be a mockery of ju&s;tice to refer the Bri|ti&s;h complainants to our courts, when neither their property, nor the per&s;ons who injured them are within our juri&s;diction. It will not be pretended that the&s;e complaints are in a &s;imilar &s;tate with ours.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t concedes that the country occupied by Indians within the Briti&s;h territory, contains, by far, the great|e&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="028389_0541_0FD8ECA6D6C04F70">proportion of furs, but then it is &s;aid, that this is not advan|tageous, becau&s;e the Briti&s;h traders can &s;upply their &s;tores from the United States. By his own &s;tatement, then, the advantage is double. We can purcha&s;e largely of furs, and can pay for them by the &s;ale of goods. Is it di&s;advantageous to have a new market open, where we can buy a valuable article, either for our u&s;e at home, or for exportation to foreign countries? be|cau&s;e a market is likewi&s;e opened, where we may vend many goods imported from Europe and A&s;ia, at our own prices; for this writer &s;ays, by rea&s;on of ice in the St. Lawrence, the Bri|ti&s;h traders cannot import goods from Europe more than half the year&mdash;and will be obliged to &s;upply their &s;tores from the United States.</P>
<P>In the next paragraph he &s;ays&mdash;"They will al&s;o be able, however extraordinary the grant of this privilege may appear, to import their goods into any port of the United States, and from &s;uch Atlantic port tran&s;port the &s;ame throughout our whole territory, free of <HI>an alien duty,</HI> upon the &s;ame terms as our own citizens"&mdash;What this writer would intend here cannot be con|jectured&mdash;He certainly cannot intend to &s;ay, that Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects can import goods into the Atlantic ports of the United States, at le&s;s duties than they did before the treaty&mdash;If he does he intends to deceive his readers&mdash;There is not a word in the treaty that gives &s;uch right&mdash;Goods imported into the Atlantic ports by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are liable to the &s;ame duties before and after the ratification of the treaty. If they &s;hould choo&s;e to im|port all their goods into the Atlantic ports of the United States, and pay us duties, and tran&s;port them through our territories, what would be the injury to us? None&mdash;We &s;hould be great gainers. And no &s;en&s;ible man could ever &s;uppo&s;e any other than beneficial con&s;equences, if all the Briti&s;h colonies were to be &s;upplied through the United States.</P>
<P>In the next &s;entence, the note is entirely changed, and it is there a&s;&s;erted, "that Briti&s;h traders have &s;uch large capitals and &s;uch connexions with the Indians; and Americans have &s;uch &s;mall capitals and without &s;uch connexions, that the article can be of no advantage to the Americans." His only meaning here can be, that we can neither have a market for importation or exportation. He is reque&s;ted to reconcile the contradiction between this and the former part of the paragraph; where he gives us to under&s;tand that the Briti&s;h traders mu&s;t be &s;upplied from the United States, becau&s;e they cannot import more than half the year by &s;ea. He &s;ays, "A&s;iatic goods under the treaty cannot be afforded on better terms, by American citizens, than by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; becau&s;e the Briti&s;h government re&s;erves
<PB N="254" REF="028389_0542_0FD8ECAA8DDC7640">to it&s;elf the right of impo&s;ing on American ve&s;&s;els entering into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnage duty equal to that which &s;hall be payable by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the ports of America; and al&s;o &s;uch duty as may be adequate to countervail the differ|ence of duty now payable on the importation of European and A&s;iatic goods, imported into the United States, in Briti&s;h or American ve&s;&s;els." The Con&s;titutionali&s;t is de&s;ired to point out how this article can po&s;&s;ibly produce the con&s;equences he pre|dicts, or what relation it has to this &s;ubject. We import our A&s;iatic goods, direct from A&s;ia. We do not import them from any Briti&s;h ports in Europe.</P>
<P>It has not been denied, that A&s;iatic goods are a third cheap|er in the United States than in England, whence the coloni&s;ts mu&s;t get them, unle&s;s they import them from America. How then can it be &s;aid, with or without this wonderful rea&s;on, which, with equal aptne&s;s, might be applied to increa&s;e the clamour on the negro bu&s;ine&s;s, that A&s;iatic goods cannot be afforded on better terms, by American citizens, than by Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubjects? He goes on to &s;ay, "that more is required than the naked a&s;&s;ertion of the Federali&s;t, to prove, that the Ame|rican citizens will be able to import the goods, that are con|&s;umed by the Indians, into the United States, upon better terms than Briti&s;h &s;ubjects can import the like merchandizes into the Briti&s;h provinces." It is true, and the knowledge of every reflecting man is what &s;upports the a&s;&s;ertion; but, le&s;t the a&s;|&s;ertion of the Federali&s;t &s;hould not be believed, for the rea&s;ons given by him, the Con&s;titutionali&s;t endeavours to confirm it, by telling us, that the Briti&s;h traders will have an advantage in buying of us, rather than importing by the river St. Law|rence; that the Briti&s;h can even import into the Atlantic ports of the United States, and thence tran&s;port by land into the in|terior of their own country, on better terms than they can into their own ports.</P>
<P>This writer a&s;&s;erts, "that the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects could not en|ter our ports as freely before the treaty as they may in ca&s;e of its ratification, for they were before &s;ubject to an alien duty, which will be completely &s;u&s;pended by its ratification." The a&s;&s;ertion of the Federali&s;t was, "they, &s;peaking of the Briti&s;h, enter our &s;ea-ports as freely now as they can by treaty." This is true; and the Con&s;titutionali&s;t is de&s;ired to &s;how a word in the treaty, that le&s;&s;ens the duty now paid, by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, in our &s;ea-ports.</P>
<P>After allowing that the traffic with the Indians is within the Briti&s;h territories, he remarks, that "ju&s;t removing her po&s;ts, over the line of inter&s;ection, between the two territories, by
<PB N="255" REF="028389_0543_0FD8ECAC086B5988">which means her &s;ettlers and trading hou&s;es, will remain an in&s;urmountable barrier to the traffic of our citizens with the Indians within the Briti&s;h territories." By treaty we have a right to go into <HI>all their territories,</HI> by land, or inland navigation, not merely to their po&s;ts. Pray then, Mr. Con&s;titutionali&s;t, tell us how her &s;ettlers and trading hou&s;es will be an in&s;urmountable barrier to this trade?</P>
<P>The fur trade, he &s;ays, will not be worth a pepper corn, Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;ays, "delaying to &s;urrender us the po&s;ts cuts us off from the fur trade, which, before the war, had been al|ways of <HI>great importance, as a branch of commerce,</HI> and as a &s;ource of remittance, for the payment of our debts to Great Britain." Mr. Madi&s;on &s;tated the fur trade, withheld by the po&s;ts, worth 200,000 dollars per annum.&mdash;But the article, which admits us into a fur trade, &s;ix times greater, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, than that derived from a mere &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, this advocate of the committee calls a mere pepper corn!!</P>
<P>The 15th article of the treaty is brought forward as an objection of immen&s;e weight again&s;t the treaty. Let us &s;ee how it &s;tands. It is acknowledged, that Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els now pay an higher duty in American ports, than American ve&s;&s;els pay in Briti&s;h ports. The parties &s;tipulate to treat for the more exact equalization of duties, within two years after the pre&s;ent war, and agree that, in the interval, the difference now &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing &s;hall not be increa&s;ed. This is, in its nature, a very tem|porary arrangement; and, without an expre&s;s &s;tipulation, hardly any language can be more &s;trong, that Great Britain will not rai&s;e her duties. She mu&s;t equally rai&s;e them on all other nations, if &s;he does on us; and their duties have remain|ed the &s;ame for many years.</P>
<P>He a&s;ks the Federali&s;t, whether any &s;uch article exi&s;ts in our other treaties. The an&s;wer is, no. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, at making tho&s;e treaties, no &s;uch difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and there was no national government authorized to impo&s;e duties. And further, let it be remarked, that this article is equally be|neficial to the other powers, with whom we have &s;tipulated not to impo&s;e higher duties, than tho&s;e paid by the mo&s;t favored nations. The horrible event, therefore, of offending our allies, need not be apprehended from this article.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t allows, that all the a&s;&s;ertions made by the Federali&s;t, re&s;pecting the right of nations having colonies, are true; and ob&s;erves, that there are but few, in this enlight|ened country, who are &s;o ignorant as not to know, that unle&s;s we gain a right by treaty, Great Britain may prohibit our trad|ing, or even entering the ports of her colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="256" REF="028389_0544_0FD8ECB217A01880">without affording us any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. Every admi&s;|&s;ion, then, of American ve&s;&s;els into her colonies mu&s;t be con|&s;idered a grant in our favor, of certain acknowledged rights.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that by the confe&s;&s;ion of this writer, he, and tho&s;e who&s;e cau&s;e he attempts to advocate, complain of the article ceding us certain rights in the Ea&s;t In|dies, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. Having an ab&s;olute right, according to the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, to deny us all trade, the permi&s;&s;ion of even a partial commerce mu&s;t be con&s;idered an advantage gained by the treaty.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t is reque&s;ted to point to any thing that we give in exchange for this important trade to the Ea&s;t Indies. Here is the ce&s;&s;ion of a right which it is acknowledged Great Britain was under no obligation to grant, for which in return we have granted nothing; but they &s;ay the treaty wants a reci|procation of benefits from Britain to America.</P>
<P>The Federali&s;t expre&s;&s;ed no admiration, nor even an opinion of the writings of Lord Sheffield; he only quoted his words: he has frequently quoted the Con&s;titutionali&s;t&mdash;By the &s;ame rule it may be concluded, he admires the writings under this &s;ignature&mdash;to draw &s;uch conclu&s;ions from &s;uch premi&s;es, is a &s;pecies of logic yet unknown to the Federali&s;t&mdash;he forbears any further remarks&mdash;he writes merely with a view of pointing to the truth&mdash;to lead men to think and act for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t, after having fully and completely al|lowed the rights of Britain to an exclu&s;ive trade with her colo|nies, and ab&s;olute want of a right in us to trade there, unle&s;s ceded by treaty, has the wi&s;dom to contend that we ought not to receive any by &s;tipulation; and that the treaty ought not to be ratified becau&s;e of an article which gives us a valuable trade to her colonies.</P>
<P>But then he implies that a trade to the Ea&s;t Indies will not be &s;ub&s;tantially beneficial, becau&s;e, in his opinion, on compa|ri&s;on with its pre&s;ent advantages, it will not be equally &s;o as now. This may be offered as a &s;ample of logic&mdash;it is certainly neither truth nor common &s;en&s;e, to &s;ay that a thing cannot be &s;ub&s;tantially, or po&s;itively good, becau&s;e it has been better.</P>
<P>Goods are u&s;ually &s;old cheaper in O&s;tend than here&mdash;proof offered&mdash;they are <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> imported from that country to this. India goods are <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> imported from England into America; therefore, they are cheaper there, than here. They are <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> imported from France into America. According to &s;uch rea&s;oning, it would not be difficult to prove that almo&s;t every article of commerce is cheaper in every part of the world, with which we trade, than in America. Do merchants never &s;end
<PB N="257" REF="028389_0545_0FD8ECB391059AE0">goods from one port to another, but when they are dearer in the place &s;ent to, than in the place &s;ent from? This would be to &s;uppo&s;e certain knowledge in a merchant of the different markets, in di&s;tant quarters of the world, not only of times pa&s;t and pre&s;ent, but of future times. This would be a kind of pre&s;cience extremely valuable, but not yet attained. Do mer|chants never &s;end goods to a port for a remittance, becau&s;e they are cheaper in the place &s;ent to than the place &s;ent from? The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, goods &s;ent from America to the Ea&s;t Indies, are generally &s;old at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, for a moment, that the rea&s;on given &s;upports his a&s;&s;ertion, what has it to do with our trade to A&s;ia? The true que&s;tion by a merchant would be, where can I procure A&s;iatic goods on the cheape&s;t and be&s;t terms? If in O&s;tend, rather than in India, it will be better to import &s;uch goods from O&s;tend than India. But until it can be &s;hown, that India goods can be imported on better terms from Europe, after the mer|chants have added their profits, than from A&s;ia, it is probable the trade will continue, and be con&s;idered a beneficial one, although they are <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> imported from O&s;tend.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on, though it came out mode&s;tly in the fir&s;t part of the paragraph, in the latter part is made to prove that not only our trade to India will in future not be beneficial, but that we might obtain our India goods in O&s;tend cheaper than in A&s;ia. What a pity, that this rea&s;oning had not been brought to the public eye, before this late hour. The merchants of Salem and Bo&s;ton had more than thirty ve&s;&s;els, chiefly &s;hips, in the year 1793, amounting to more than five thou&s;and tons, &s;tupidly pur&s;uing a voyage of fifteen months, at three times the ex|pen&s;e that it would have co&s;t them to have obtained the &s;ame profits from O&s;tend, in five months, according to this writer &mdash;for the charge of five per cent. to procure bonds exi&s;ts no where but in his imagination. There is not a word in the treaty rendering bonds nece&s;&s;ary. The increa&s;e of twenty per cent. likewi&s;e, which he has conjured up, has no other foundation. The words of the treaty are, "neither is this article to be con|&s;trued to allow the citizens of the &s;aid &s;tates to &s;ettle or re&s;ide within the &s;aid territories, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h government e&s;tabli&s;hed there; and if any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be attempted again&s;t the regulations of the Briti&s;h government in this re&s;pect, the ob|&s;ervance of the &s;ame &s;hall and may be enforced again&s;t the citizens of America, in the &s;ame manner as again&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects or others tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame rule." It cannot be deni|ed by any who read this part of the article, that we have the
<PB N="258" REF="028389_0546_0FD8ECB5570F61A0">&s;ame right after as before the ratification of the treaty; and a candid man would have thought, that putting our citizens on exactly the &s;ame footing as their own, would have re&s;cued this part of it, at lea&s;t, from cen&s;ure; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the immen&s;e expen&s;e Great Britain incurs for &s;ecuring this trade to her own &s;ubjects. It is yet po&s;&s;ible that the merchants will continue to rely more on their own calculations, than this &s;ublime logic of the &s;chools.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t agrees that Great Britain may prohibit us from all trade in her Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements, without ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint on our part&mdash;That &s;he has &s;tipulated to grant that which we could not claim of right, and which &s;he has not &s;tipulated to grant to any other nation&mdash;That having &s;tipulated to grant us certain rights, does not impair her power to permit us the exerci&s;e of others&mdash;That our rights by per|mi&s;&s;ion will be as &s;trong after, as before a ratification of the treaty&mdash;Yet he concludes that we are expre&s;sly prohibited by treaty from all trade not ab&s;olutely granted. This appears to be a palpable contradiction in the Con&s;titutionali&s;t&mdash;He may, how|ever, con&s;ole him&s;elf by &s;etting down this remark as a &s;elf-evi|dent propo&s;ition&mdash;He &s;ays, "America had certainly a right to expect the &s;ame indulgences would have been &s;ecured to her citizens in their intercour&s;e to the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in India, as are enjoyed by other nations." (<HI>Indulgences</HI>&mdash;Strange that this writer would u&s;e &s;uch a term as applying to us from Bri|tain.) Let it be remarked in an&s;wer to this ob&s;ervation; that other nations have no <HI>indulgences &s;ecured to them.</HI> Further, Great Britain cannot prohibit us any indulgences without prohibiting them to other nations, according to the 15th arti|cle of the treaty, wherein it is &s;aid, "Nor &s;hall any prohibition be impo&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any articles, to or from the territories of the two parties re&s;pectively, which &s;hall not equally extend to all other nations."</P>
<P>He &s;ays that "Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els by the treaty, receive from us indulgences, which are not allowed even to our allies." This is not true&mdash;It cannot be &s;upported by a word in the Briti&s;h treaty. And the treaty between us and France, expre&s;sly &s;tipu|lates, that her &s;ubjects &s;hall enjoy and receive every right and immunity that other nations do or <HI>&s;hall</HI> enjoy.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;upports the 8th rea&s;on of the town, by a&s;king, whether in other treaties, there is any &s;tipulation that we will export goods directly from India to America.&mdash; The an&s;wer is, there is not; and the rea&s;on is obvious. No other nation has permitted us by treaty, to go to India. There is no re&s;triction of a trade there, in our treaties with other
<PB N="259" REF="028389_0547_0FD8ECBA677B73D0">powers, becau&s;e they do not allow us to trade there at all. This may be put down in the cla&s;s of &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions. The Federali&s;t rejoices that he has &s;o many; wherever he finds any in the writings of his opponents, he will certainly pay them the tribute of acknowledgment.</P>
<P>He has mentioned &s;ome of the errors, and contradictions of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t. There are others &s;o &s;elf-evident, that it would be an affront on the public, to &s;uppo&s;e they can be read, without being in&s;tantly &s;een and felt.&mdash;Such are tho&s;e on the clau&s;e by which Great Britain re&s;erves a right to place her du|ties on a par with ours. This is an article which appeals &s;o for|cibly to our &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice for its fitne&s;s, that objections to it could not have been thought po&s;&s;ible; and it cannot e&s;cape the notice of the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, that all who attempt to &s;upport their objections, con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ume premi&s;es, or draw conclu&s;ions &s;o apparently fal&s;e, as to convince their readers of the very rever&s;e of what they intended.</P>

<P>THE fourth number of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t in &s;upport of the town's committee, "that the reciprocity contained in the treaty, was merely nominal and delu&s;ive," offers the 3d, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 28th articles. The ob&s;ervations, there|fore, made by the Federali&s;t, on the third, &s;ixth, &s;eventh, tenth, and twenty-eighth articles, and which have remained uncon|troverted by the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, have &s;atisfactorily proved, as he tru&s;ts, that they are highly beneficial to the United States; that the third opens to us a very lucrative trade, and liberali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es the colony &s;y&s;tem in our favor, more than Great Britain has ever done to any other nation, and more than any other nation has ever done to the United States&mdash;which trade, by the ac|knowledgment of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, &s;he might have withheld without any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint on our part; that the twenty-eighth article &s;ecures to our citizens payment for pro|vi&s;ions, in ca&s;es where, by the exi&s;ting law of nations, &s;uch provi&s;ions would have been ju&s;tly forfeited. It is not denied, that this is the natural and obvious con&s;truction of the article; indeed words could not have made this plainer. What then can be the motives of writers who &s;ee and confe&s;s this to be the true &s;en&s;e of the terms; and, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;ert that "by
<PB N="260" REF="028389_0548_0FD8ECBE090FFDF8">this &s;tipulation the United States &s;urrender to Great Britain the right never before re&s;tricted, to &s;end certain articles to France, and even legalize her arbitrary &s;eizure of them." Do they think that a fal&s;ehood, becau&s;e it is repeated, can be palmed on the public for truth? Or do they think becau&s;e they frequently tell of their love for the people, and their re&s;pect for an <HI>enlight|ened public,</HI> that they can thus in&s;ult their under&s;tanding, at the expen&s;e of truth and common &s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>The ninth article is con&s;idered as extremely injurious&mdash;and the Con&s;titutionali&s;t has been plea&s;ed to remark that Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects now hold va&s;t tracts of land in the United States, in fee &s;imple, and that American citizens now hold a few rods of land in the Briti&s;h dominions, in <HI>fee tail</HI> only. Whence this writer a&s;&s;umed this fact is not known&mdash;It is believed to exi&s;t only in his own imagination.</P>
<P>Among the artifices attempted to impo&s;e on the public, none have been more indu&s;triou&s;ly u&s;ed, than that of exciting an idea in the people, that their lands were to be holden by Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, and that this article would even deprive them of their own &s;oil.&mdash;The mo&s;t ridiculous fal&s;ehoods have been circulated in conver&s;ation, and in the public papers; &s;uch as have &s;hown the utmo&s;t contempt for the under&s;tandings of our fellow citi|zens, with a view of frightening weak and childi&s;h minds. The words of the article merely extend to lands <HI>now holden.</HI> It gives a Briti&s;h &s;ubject no right to buy real e&s;tate; he cannot acquire lands by purcha&s;e under this article. It contains no other right than is in the treaty of peace; with this addition, that they who now hold lands may convey them by devi&s;e or otherwi&s;e&mdash; Whereas by a rigid con&s;truction of the article in the treaty of peace, and the law re&s;pecting a right to hold lands by aliens, the be&s;t &s;ubjects could only hold lands during their lives, and if a de&s;cent was ca&s;t before a conveyance, the lands became e&s;|cheated to the government.</P>
<P>Until the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, any alien, being a free white per&s;on, who had re&s;ided two years in the United States, and one year in any particular &s;tate, and could give &s;atisfac|tory proof to any court of record, that he was a per&s;on of good character, on taking an oath to &s;upport the con&s;titution of the United States, might become a citizen of the United States. This naturalized not only the alien, but al&s;o all his children un|der twenty one years of age. Thus cheap and ea&s;y was the mode not only of acquiring a right to hold lands, but of mo&s;t of all the rights that could in any ca&s;e appertain to a citizen.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Georgia the la&s;t winter, &s;old many millions acres of land, and in their deeds of ce&s;&s;ion enacted, that if
<PB N="261" REF="028389_0549_0FD8ECBFE13B4360">aliens purcha&s;ed, they &s;hould hold the &s;ame, with all the privi|leges that could appertain to them, if citizens. In the month of May, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, the &s;tate of Connecticut propo&s;ed to &s;ell a tract of land, containing &s;everal millions of acres&mdash;and, in their act, they expre&s;sly authorized their committee to make &s;ale of the land, and execute deeds thereof to any per&s;ons, whether inha|bitants of the United States, <HI>or others.</HI> It is &s;aid, that in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, any aliens may purcha&s;e and hold lands. In our treaty with France, Frenchmen are expre&s;sly authorized to hold lands. After &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;e of the people, on the &s;ubject of aliens holding lands, it cannot be pre&s;umed, that it is in the power of the mo&s;t ranting madman to impo&s;e a belief on the weake&s;t, that a clau&s;e in the treaty which permits Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to retain and convey the lands they now hold, can be of the &s;malle&s;t evil.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays there was no doubt in the mini&s;ters who negociated the treaty, as to the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace.

<P>The 6th article is nominal and delu&s;ive, as this writer a&s;&s;erts, becau&s;e it is not therein &s;tipulated that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be appointed to decide on debts due from Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to citi|zens of the United States, and lo&s;t by lawful impediments. If &s;uch a &s;tipulation had been in&s;erted, it might well have been termed nominal and delu&s;ive; for it is well known that there is not the &s;malle&s;t pretence for &s;aying that any lawful impediment exi&s;ts in Great Britain, &s;ince the treaty of peace, again&s;t the recovery of debts due to American citizens, by the operation whereof, full and adequate compen&s;ation cannot now be ob|tained in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings.</P>

The quotation from Vattel, re&s;pecting the manner in which republics treat with monarchs, is fully agreed by the Federali&s;t &mdash;and the character of our envoy, long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed in the grateful remembrance of his countrymen, would not &s;uffer a doubt in the mind of any man, that this equality of republics would be fully vindicated by him. The treaty of commerce, which is the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, has only added another proof of his ability, in vindicating the rights of republics. In the treaty of peace, which he, with his compatriots, &s;o ably nego|ciated at Paris, he gave the fulle&s;t evidence of his &s;kill and power in treating on equal terms with royal governments, though oppo&s;ed by an in&s;idious ally, and deceitful court. At that time the &s;ame men, who now attempt to de&s;troy his well earned fame, would have pro&s;trated the republic of America at the feet of a royal court, now acknowledged to be the mo&s;t corrupt and perfidious in Europe. The firmne&s;s and abilities of Mr. Adams, the vice-pre&s;ident, and Mr. Jay, &s;aved our coun|try from the di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The &s;ugge&s;tion that the Federali&s;t can be offended by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a doctrine like that mentioned by Vattel, ex|cites no other emotions in his brea&s;t than tho&s;e of contempt.</P>
<P>From the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal con&s;titution to the pre|&s;ent moment, there has been a party in the United States, which with uncea&s;ing and active malignancy has oppo&s;ed the free&s;t republic on earth&mdash;This party, neverthele&s;s, boa&s;ts of its repub|licani&s;m.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t in his fifth number, in vindication of the 11th rea&s;on of the town, and in oppo&s;ition to the treaty, becau&s;e it expre&s;sly &s;tipulates, that in ca&s;e of war, debts, nei|ther public nor private, &s;hall be confi&s;cated, &s;eems to concede that credit has been of great efficacy in producing the pro&s;pe|rity of our country; and that, in the la&s;t war, nothing was gained by a &s;eque&s;tration of debts&mdash;con&s;iders &s;uch truths as irrevelant to the &s;ubject. Surely if the people are &s;atisfied, that credit has produced and is producing the mo&s;t con&s;picuous ad|vantages to this country, they will avoid every thing that tends to impair credit, for by le&s;&s;ening that, they will a&s;&s;uredly le&s;|&s;en their advantages.&mdash;If, in the la&s;t war, they e&s;&s;ayed this method of deriving benefit, and found it un&s;ucce&s;sful, they will call for complete proof of its &s;uppo&s;ed advantages, before they attempt it again. The que&s;tion he makes, is&mdash;Has the United States a right, by the law of nations, to confi&s;cate &s;uch debts? He a&s;&s;erts that they have, and to prove the a&s;&s;ertion, quotes Vattel; but either overlooked a very material part of a paragraph, re&s;pecting private debts, or for &s;ome purpo&s;e, did
<PB N="263" REF="028389_0551_0FD8ECC612CEA2E0">not choo&s;e to bring it into view. Immediately following his fir&s;t quotations, and between that and his la&s;t quotation, are the&s;e words&mdash;"But at pre&s;ent, in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe, have departed from this rigour; and as this cu&s;tom has been generally receiv|ed, he who &s;hould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for &s;trangers tru&s;ted his &s;ubjects only, from a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion, that the general cu&s;tom would be ob&s;erved." Vattel is here &s;peaking of debts, due from individuals of one nation to tho&s;e of another; and this is the writer quoted by the Con&s;ti|tutionali&s;t, to &s;upport the right of confi&s;cating private debts. Which are we mo&s;t to admire at, the weakne&s;s of the com|mittee's advocate, or his audacity in thus attempting to impo&s;e on the public?</P>
<P>If we had occa&s;ion to remark on the meanne&s;s and fal&s;ity of conduct in excluding an intermediate pa&s;&s;age that &s;o completely de&s;troyed a doctrine the Con&s;titutionali&s;t was labouring to &s;up|port, we can feel nothing but contempt for a writer who in&s;ults the public under&s;tanding, by making the following quotation, viz.&mdash;"A &s;tate at war, does not &s;o much as touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in ca&s;e of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure." And then a&s;&s;erts, that he has demon&s;trated, that "a right to &s;eque&s;ter or confi&s;cate monies in the public &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds, does exi&s;t according to the law of nature and nations."</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, "the &s;ituation of European nati|ons, might have led them to this cu&s;tom, but they have not recognized the &s;ame by any national compacts or treaties." The word cu&s;tom, as quoted from Vattel, referred to private debts, as any one may &s;ee, who will turn to Vattel, 3d book, chap. 5th, &s;ect. 77.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titutionali&s;t, with his u&s;ual di&s;po&s;ition to pervert the truth, applies it to the la&s;t quotation from Vattel, which re|&s;pects monies credited to the public. The Con&s;titutionali&s;t fur|ther a&s;&s;erts, in &s;peaking of a right to confi&s;cate debts generally, "the exerci&s;e of this right, has never yet been re&s;tricted by treaty. It has, by common con&s;ent, re&s;ted entirely with the wi&s;dom and humanity of nations."</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, are ab&s;olutely untrue, There is &s;carcely a treaty made in the la&s;t century between any of the European nations, but what re&s;tricts the right to confi&s;|cate debts, and recognizes the doctrine, as laid down by Vat|tel, to have originated from cu&s;tom. In the treaty between Ru&s;|&s;ia and Great Britain, 12th article, it is &s;tipulated, "that if the peace &s;hould come to be broke, the per&s;ons, &s;hips, and
<PB N="264" REF="028389_0552_0FD8ECC70D8BD988">commodities, &s;hall not be detained, or confi&s;cated; but they &s;hall be allowed, at lea&s;t, the &s;pace of one year, to &s;ell, di&s;po&s;e, or carry off their effects;&mdash;and they &s;hall farther be permitted, either at or before their departure, to con&s;ign the effects which they &s;hall not as yet have di&s;po&s;ed of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall think proper, in order to di&s;po&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem as they de&s;ire, and for their benefit; which debts the debtors &s;hall be obliged to pay in the &s;ame manner as if no &s;uch rupture had happened." In the treaty made between Spain and Great Britain, in the year 1667, is the following article; "if a war &s;hall happen, the re&s;pective &s;ubjects and people &s;hall have notice thereof, given them in time, viz.&mdash;&s;ix months to tran&s;port their merchandize and effects, without giving them in that time, any mole&s;tation or trouble, or retaining or embarra&s;&s;ing their goods or per&s;ons." In the treaty between Great Britain and Portugal, concluded in 1642, the 18th article is as follows; "in ca&s;e of difference, two years are allowed on both &s;ides, to tran&s;port their merchan|dizes and goods, and, in the mean time, there &s;hall be no in|jury or prejudice, done to any per&s;on or goods, on either &s;ide." In the treaty between Ru&s;&s;ia and Denmark, 35th article, it is &s;tipulated, "merchants &s;hall have a year to depart, may &s;ell, part with, or remove their effects, and tho&s;e who owe them money, &s;hall be obliged to pay their debts, equally as if no rupture had happened." In the treaty made between France and Great Britain, in the year 1786, it is agreed, in the 2d ar|ticle, "that if at any time there &s;hould ari&s;e any mi&s;under|&s;tandings, breach of friend&s;hip, or rupture between the crowns of their maje&s;ties, the &s;ubjects of each of the two parties, re&s;iding in the dominions of the other, &s;hall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade therein, without any manner of di&s;turbance, &s;o long as they behave peaceably, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in ca&s;e their conduct &s;hould render them &s;u&s;pected, and the re&s;pective governments &s;hould be obliged to order them to remove, the term of twelve months &s;hall be allowed them for that purpo&s;e, in order that they may remove with their effects and property, whether intru&s;ted to individuals or to the &s;tate."</P>
<P>The 20th article of our treaty with France, the 3d of that with the United Netherlands, and the 23d with that with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, re&s;trict the exerci&s;e of this right which the Con&s;titutionali&s;t &s;ays, never has yet been re&s;tricted by treaty. &mdash;What confidence can be placed in a writer, who makes &s;uch fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, to induce the people to adopt principles which are exploded by all the civilized world; and which, even the barbarians of Algiers have abandoned, as too di&s;graceful for their character?</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="028389_0553_0FD8ECC9D5C643B8">
After a review of the a&s;&s;ertions of the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, in his 5th number, none can wonder at his attempts to ridicule morality, and his exclamations at what he is plea&s;ed to call a &s;aint-like zeal again&s;t inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>After all, the public cannot avoid the conclu&s;ion, that wri|ters like the Con&s;titutionali&s;t, who object to the treaty, on ac|count of the article re&s;pecting the confi&s;cation of debts, are guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t affectation. For no one can &s;uppo&s;e, from the di&s;play they are plea&s;ed to make of their own princi|ples, that any re&s;triction by treaty would bind them to re&s;pect the rights it contracted for.</P>

<P>OUR commerce in Europe, hath been of late carried on chiefly in our own &s;hipping, which accounts, in part, for their wonderful augmentation in number and &s;ize. Part of our commerce to Europe is, in fact, an indirect We&s;t India trade; the jealous policy of Spain, having led her to &s;hut her We&s;t Indies to all nations, we have, with &s;ome exceptions, been in|cluded in the univer&s;al prohibition: but, on the other hand, wanting our &s;upplies, &s;he takes them at Cadiz, St. Andero, Ferrol, &amp;c. and tran&s;ports the flour from thence, in her own &s;hips, to the Havanna, Curracoa, &amp;c. Even this is a much better footing for us than Britain propo&s;es in the 70 tons article; becau&s;e it gives our &s;hipping a freight to Europe, in common times, of one to one and an half dollar per barrel, forming an immen&s;e object of profit to the United States; which, indeed, augments the price to the Spani&s;h planter in the We&s;t Indies; but is not otherwi&s;e injurious to us than as it hampers and makes circuitous the intercour&s;e with our neighbours, and &s;hows a &s;trange conduct in the government, who&s;e &s;ubjects mu&s;t eat &s;tale and dear flour by this circuitous channel, when they might have it &s;o much cheaper and fre&s;her, direct. Our chief trade in Europe with Spain, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ale of flour for her We&s;t Indies, which we are chiefly paid for in &s;pecie, or bills on London of equal value, remitted in payment for manu|factures we take from Britain. With the Italian &s;tates we have but little intercour&s;e: they produce grain and rice in abundance, u&s;ually, them&s;elves: tobacco and fi&s;h are the only articles we could &s;ell to advantage there; but for this we mu&s;t wait, not till the nations of Europe make peace, but till we can make peace with Algiers and Morocco, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, will hap|pen

With re&s;pect to France, our trade is generally in grain, flour, tobacco and rice, in that quarter: &mdash;the peace mu&s;t benefit this immen&s;ely; for it is to be pre|&s;umed the republic will not &s;uffer, as formerly, farmers gene|ral to monopolize tobacco, and Briti&s;h &s;hips to carry it, to our and their great prejudice: I anticipate, therefore, an immen&s;e increa&s;e, at the peace, in our commercial concerns with our good old friends and allies.

<P>To a people who feel for their country, and have its welfare at heart, it mu&s;t be a very unplea&s;ant ta&s;k to complain of pub|lic mea&s;ures; but whatever painful &s;en&s;ation it may excite, it is a duty they owe to them&s;elves and po&s;terity to notice any act militating again&s;t their rights and intere&s;ts. In this light we have viewed the treaty; and under that impre&s;&s;ion have &s;tated our objections, which we hope will appear to be well founded.</P>
<P>We feel a confidence, &s;ir, that in laying our grievances be|fore you, they will be attended to; and that the man who was &s;o in&s;trumental in e&s;tabli&s;hing our rights and liberties, will not take any &s;tep to impair them.</P>
<P>In giving our opinions on &s;o momentous a &s;ubject, we con|ceive that we have expre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiments of a large majority of the citizens of this as well as of the other &s;tates. Should this be the ca&s;e, we doubt not but you will meet the wi&s;hes of your country, by withholding your &s;ignature from a treaty, which, if ratified, will be productive of the mo&s;t ruinous con|&s;equences to the United States.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">At a Meeting of the Inhabitants from &s;undry Parts of the Com|monwealth, at the Court-hou&s;e in <HI>Lexington (Kentucky)</HI> on Fri|day the 28th Day of Augu&s;t, <HI>1795;</HI> the Treaty, lately concluded on by Lord Grenville and John Jay, was fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the following Re&s;olutions unanimou&s;ly agreed to.</HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, That the citizens now a&s;&s;embled have the undoubted right, at all times, to expre&s;s their opinions publicly, on <HI>every</HI> mea&s;ure of government, and that on none can it more behove them, than on the propo&s;al of a treaty with any foreign power, as a treaty is not con&s;titutionally a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of the people's immediate repre&s;en|tatives.</P>
<P>That the treaty concluded on by John Jay with the Briti&s;h government, contains a catalogue of terms and conditions, &s;hameful to the American name;</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the American character is di&s;graced by its very lan|guage, it being on the part of Great Britain, couched in terms haughty and imperious, and on the part of America, in lan|guage &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and humiliating.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it does expre&s;sly contraven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our treaty with our only natural allies, the French, and it is thereby a ba&s;e infraction of the rights of amity and gratitude, which they are entitled to from us; in behalf of a government who cordially de&s;pi&s;e us, and who, in conjunction with their allies the Indians, have never cea&s;ed to &s;pill our blood, and plunder our property for twenty years.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it has let the &s;ubjects of this ho&s;tile and treacher|ous government into a participation of our right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and has thereby di&s;pelled every hope of obtaining an amicable adju&s;tment of our differences with Spain on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, by it, we tamely and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively agree to receive, when it &s;uits the Briti&s;h king, the po&s;ts on the lakes, without any conce&s;&s;ions or reparation for their detention.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="028389_0558_0FD8ECD7921476B8">
Becau&s;e Jay has dared to cede, and that to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, a part of the American &s;oil, and has, moreover, &s;ubmitted the bounds of &s;uch ce&s;&s;ion, to the di&s;cretion of the Briti&s;h king.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the whole of the Briti&s;h debts, with intere&s;t, are &s;addled, ultimately, on the whole people of the United States; a thing not ever a&s;ked for, or expected by the mo&s;t griping cre|ditor.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it has waved all claim for the value of the negroes plundered and carried off in violation of the treaty of 1783, to the total ruin of many of the owners.</P>
<P>But la&s;tly and principally, becau&s;e this government is and has long been totally de&s;titute of that, without which, treaties become only plots and robberies, FAITH. Her <HI>magnanimity</HI> &s;hows it&s;elf, through the Indian's tomahawk and &s;calping knife; her friend&s;hip in the Algerine crui&s;ers; and her truth, hone&s;ty, and ju&s;tice, in violating the treaty of 1783, in detaining the po&s;ts, in her commercial regulations, and in her late robberies of the American ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The alliance of &s;uch a corrupt, degenerate, and &s;inking govern|ment, ought religiou&s;ly to be avoided by the American people.</P>
<P>That H. Toulmin, James Hughes, and James Brown be a committee to prepare an addre&s;s to the pre&s;ident, expre&s;&s;ive of our &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject, and that they make a report to this meeting at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on the next Fayette court day.</P>

<P>AFTER a calm, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and mature di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every article of &s;aid treaty, the following declaration and re&s;olutions were agreed to:</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="028389_0559_0FD8ECD7944583A0">
Actuated neither by party &s;pirit, prejudice nor malevolence; uninfluenced by the proceedings of the unwi&s;e and intemperate; &s;trangers to intrigue, but (we hope) fortified again&s;t it; we de|clare our &s;entiments of our pre&s;ent political &s;ituation to the world.</P>
<P>At a time when another nation is &s;truggling to &s;ecure liberty, it becomes us to be watchful of our own. Nineteen years have now elap&s;ed &s;ince the independence of our country was declared; our blood, our trea&s;ure, and the lives of many of our friends and fellow citizens, were &s;acrificed to purcha&s;e it. We con|ceive that we &s;hould be unju&s;t to our lives, and traitors to our country, to remain &s;ilent when in&s;idious attempts are made to wre&s;t from us our deare&s;t privileges. As a portion of the peo|ple we feel as they do, and our intere&s;ts are in&s;eparable. At|tempts have been made to vilify the people, by traducing the po|pular &s;ocieties, loading them with &s;lander, contumely, with every epithet of reproach, and repre&s;enting them as enemies to their country, and di&s;turbers of the public peace; the&s;e "&s;elf-created &s;ocieties," the organs of the public mind, the guardians of the rights of the people, like to the hundred eyes of Argus in pre|venting illicit intrigues, will be dreaded, de&s;pi&s;ed, or cen&s;ured, by none but the <HI>guilty</HI> and <HI>ba&s;e.</HI> An hone&s;t man, whether in the humble paths of private life, or in public national tru&s;t, need never be afraid of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny.&mdash;The de&s;igns of the traitor as of the private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, may be known only to him|&s;elf: but overt actions &s;peak for them&s;elves. When the ba&s;e de&s;igns and conduct of <HI>men in authority</HI> are &s;o glaring, it is a duty, which every man owes to his country, to come forward to declare his &s;entiments and expo&s;e &s;uch as have abu&s;ed their power and perverted their tru&s;t. Such are the principles and &s;uch has been the conduct of Mr. Jay, as appears from his former opinions, and late conduct as envoy; by his principles, always favorable to the unju&s;t claims of our former enemy, and by his conduct attempting to undermine the liberties of his fel|low citizens, to load them with unmerited obloquy, and to rai&s;e up this mon&s;ter of ari&s;tocracy, the enemy of mankind, and the &s;courge of nations. We are &s;orry that we have not been di&s;ap|pointed in our expectation of Mr. Jay's negociation; but we are deceived in the object of his mi&s;&s;ion: we were told that he was &s;ent to demand the delivery of the we&s;tern po&s;ts and compen|&s;ation for our dome&s;tics, carried away by the Briti&s;h plunderers, as the former treaty of peace gave us a right to demand; we were told that he was in&s;tructed to demand &s;atisfaction for the depredations committed on our merchant ve&s;&s;els and goods, on the high &s;eas; but we were never told, that he had any in&s;truc|tions
<PB N="272" REF="028389_0560_0FD8ECDA629B67D0">to form a treaty, in&s;ulting to our national honor, prejudicial to our dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and injurious to our rights and inte|re&s;ts, as citizens of a free nation. The event, however, has ju&s;tified our opinion of the envoy, and our expectation of his negociation.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, therefore, That feeling indignant at the many at|tempts made by &s;ome of our men in tru&s;t again&s;t the exerci&s;e of our rights in endeavouring to bring us under the tyrannical in&s;olence of Great Britain, we will co-operate with our fellow citizens, on every ju&s;t and lawful occa&s;ion, in oppo&s;ing and counteracting every attempt to degrade the citizens of Ame|rica.&mdash;That although peace is the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, yet war, with all its attendant horrors, is to be preferred rather than to accept of it at &s;uch di&s;graceful and di&s;honorable terms as are held forth to us in &s;aid treaty.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That we con&s;ider this treaty as militating again&s;t the principles of our con&s;titution, as &s;ubjecting the commerce of this country to Britain&mdash;as a &s;urrender of the power of con|gre&s;s to form commercial regulations; and in particular as ho&s;|tile to the people of France, with whom we ought to be on the terms of friend&s;hip, if we were under no obligations of grati|tude, and if we had not been bound by a former treaty with that nation.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of this country, we conceive treaties with any foreign power, not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but impolitic, and e&s;pecially with Great Britain, who has not fulfilled the former treaty of peace, and who&s;e faith cannot be depended on.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That our fellow citizen Charles Pinckney, has our warme&s;t thanks, for his noble, manly, and &s;pirited &s;peech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. 1. page 5.</NOTE> deli|vered at the meeting in the city of Charle&s;ton, on the 22d of July, and printed in the City Gazette of the 4th in&s;tant.</P>

<P>ON motion, re&s;olved, That five per&s;ons be cho&s;en, by bal|lot, as a committee to report on the treaty of amity, com|merce, and navigation, between the United States and his Britannic maje&s;ty, on Wedne&s;day, the 19th in&s;tant, at the &s;aid court-hou&s;e; and upon counting the votes, it appeared that the following gentlemen were cho&s;en: Thomas Wad&s;worth, John Hunter, Samuel Saxon, Lewis Saxon, and Sylvanus Walker, E&s;quires.</P>
<P>On motion, re&s;olved, That this committee do draw up an addre&s;s to major Pierce Butler, approving his conduct with re|&s;pect to the &s;aid treaty, as, al&s;o, to te&s;tify their re&s;olution to &s;upport him in this and every laudable action.</P>
<P>The meeting adjourned till Wedne&s;day, the 19th in&s;tant, at 10 o'clock, A. M. when</P>
<P>The committee met, according to adjournment, in the pre|&s;ence of a numerous collection of the citizens of the county afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Sylvanus Walker, E&s;quire, re&s;igned, and Jonathan Down<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, E&s;quire, was called to the chair.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the treaty of amity, &amp;c. be read, and that it be taken into con&s;ideration, paragraph by paragragh; and laid before the citizens, together with the report and re&s;olu|tions of the committee; and, upon taking their opinion on the &s;ame, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the report and re&s;olu|tions be adopted, which are as follow:</P>
<P>The committee, to whom their fellow citizens referred the con&s;ideration of the treaty, &s;igned at London, on the 19th of November, 1794, between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States, called a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, re|port&mdash;That they have inve&s;tigated the &s;ame, as time and cir|cum&s;tances would permit, and are of opinion, that it cannot be the ba&s;is of amity and friend&s;hip; becau&s;e, on the one &s;ide, it is arrogant and dictatorial, and, on the other, pu&s;illanimous and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Therefore, re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of Laurens county, in the &s;tate of South Carolina, that the fol|lowing, among the other objections, ought, of right, to ob|&s;truct its ratification.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="274" REF="028389_0562_0FD8ECDF52D89D90">
1. The preamble is an open declaration, that the merits of the complaints and preten&s;ions of the contracting parties &s;hall not be taken into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. The 1&s;t article of the treaty abrogates laws of the differ|ent &s;tates, and makes provi&s;ion for the return of per&s;ons who were bani&s;hed only for crimes of the deepe&s;t dye, a &s;ight of whom will open the wounds which time had kindly cica|trized.</P>
<P N="3">3. The 2d article has done, for the enemies of the United States, what neither a &s;even years war, nor eleven years peace could accompli&s;h; it gives them protection in our bo&s;om, while they continue to demon&s;trate the mo&s;t inveterate hatred, both again&s;t our citizens and government. It procra&s;ti|nates the evacuation of po&s;ts held by Briti&s;h forces within our boundaries, which, by right and &s;ound policy, ought to have preceded all negociation. It even holds that up as a <HI>favor granted,</HI> which the United States ought to have demanded as their right. &mdash;Be&s;ides, the United States make a ce&s;&s;ion, the limits of which to them are unknown, as his maje&s;ty may (for ought they know) have granted to the above de&s;cribed per&s;ons, all the lands within their precincts or juri&s;diction, and which, by this treaty, the United States guarantee to them the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of.</P>
<P N="4">4. The 3d article is not only altogether partial in favor of Bri|tain, but authorizes an intercour&s;e between the &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty and the Indians within the territories of the United States, which will be a con&s;tant &s;ource of irritation and di&s;turbance, and may finally lead the United States into a war, not only with the Indians, but the Briti&s;h them&s;elves, which this treaty ought to have made provi&s;ion again&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. By the 6th article, the United States undertake to make good &s;uch lo&s;&s;es on debts to Briti&s;h creditors as have been occa&s;ioned by legal impediments, when no &s;uch impediments have exi&s;ted in any of the &s;tates that did not equally apply to citizens of the &s;ame; and becau&s;e no indemnification is made to the citizens of the United States, for property taken from them at the clo&s;e of the war, the re&s;titution of which is pro|vided for by the treaty of 1783.</P>
<P N="6">6. We think the 7th article, as it re&s;pects the injured citi|zens of the United States, altogether illu&s;ory, and calculated only to deceive, while the United States are bound to make good the damage (not done by our citizens, but) committed by other nations on our coa&s;ts.</P>
<P N="7">7. The 9th article gives to aliens &s;ome of the precious rights of citizens, while they continue without the controul
<PB N="275" REF="028389_0563_0FD8ECE09B195120">of the federal and &s;tate governments; which we think both unju&s;t and impolitic.</P>
<P N="8">8. The 10th article cedes what the United States mo&s;t in|dubitably ought to retain; and more e&s;pecally &s;o re&s;pecting Britain, the whole of who&s;e conduct towards the United States and citizens thereof, has been limited by the want of power more completely to di&s;tre&s;s us. By this article, the United States cede the only po&s;&s;ible pre&s;ent means of re&s;training that wanton nation in her unbounded in&s;ults, which &s;he has (&s;ince fir&s;t capable) offered to all nations. It is al&s;o an undue re&s;traint on the powers of congre&s;s, con&s;titutionally committed to them by the people of the United States, and ought never to be abridged by treaty.</P>
<P N="9">9. By the 12th article, the United States obtain his maje&s;ty's <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to &s;upply his &s;ubjects in the We&s;t Indies with the prime articles of life; and even that, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in a mo&s;t cramped manner, and &s;ubject to &s;uch regulations, in future, as the Briti&s;h government &s;hall think fit to impo&s;e; for which ideal favor, the United States have ceded a mo&s;t lucrative branch of the carrying trade, and agreed to give Briti&s;h &s;hips a preference in our own ports, in tran&s;porting all We&s;t India goods, and even cotton, the produce of our own &s;tates. As this article is temporary, it declares that, before its expiration, the contracting parties will endeavor further to regulate the &s;aid trade, as the then &s;ituation of his maje&s;ty may require, without mentioning the &s;ituation of the United States. It al&s;o po&s;tpones the con&s;ideration, whether neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall pro|tect enemy's property, until after the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent war, during which time, America being at peace, ought to have been her great harve&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. The 17th article is a formal acknowledgment, that Britain is the legitimate legi&s;lator of the marine world; that the orders of her admiralty &s;hall be con&s;idered as the law of nations. This unequivocal declaration of what &s;hall be right, in future, will, doubtle&s;s, have weight in determining what is pa&s;t, and not only preclude the recovery of our mo&s;t equitable demands, for unheard-of (in the hi&s;tory of any civilized nati|on) depredations made on our commerce, but al&s;o lead our allies to di&s;tru&s;t our fidelity, by which our citizens may lo&s;e their property, and the United States their allies.</P>
<P N="11">11. The 18th article is a &s;acrifice of American commerce to Briti&s;h intere&s;t.&mdash;Our produce, of almo&s;t every kind, is con|traband in time of war (which, for the la&s;t hundred years, has, with Britain, been three of war to four of peace) during which, in future, Britain has only to declare the world in a
<PB N="276" REF="028389_0564_0FD8ECE3917227F0">&s;tate of blockade, and the United States mu&s;t trade with her, or no where.</P>
<P N="12">12. The 20th and 21&s;t articles create doubts, what con|&s;truction the Briti&s;h mean, in future, to give to the word Pi|rate. &mdash;Should an American be robbed of his property, by a Briti&s;h privateer or &s;hip of war, on the high &s;eas, would he be permitted to expatriate him&s;elf and take a commi&s;&s;ion under &s;ome power at war with his Britannic maje&s;ty, in order to make re|pri&s;als! or, if he did, might he not, by this treaty, be taken, tried, and &s;uffer as a pirate, when he is pur&s;uing the only mode in his power, in order to obtain re&s;titution for unme|rited injuries, and which his country, by this treaty, has refu&s;ed to redre&s;s?</P>
<P>If he may be thus taken and &s;uffer, we think it unju&s;t, while the barbarous practice of privateering is carried on to &s;uch un|heard-of lengths by that wanton nation: at the &s;ame time, the United States allowing, nay, even compelling per&s;ons emigrat|ing to this country to expatriate them&s;elves, before they can be|come citizens of the&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P N="13">13. In the 23d article, his Britannic maje&s;ty pretends to grant, as a favor, what the mo&s;t barbarous nations &s;eldom refu&s;e, viz. giving aid in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P N="14">14. The 24th and 25th articles have a direct tendency to lead our allies to doubt, whether we are not inimical to them and their cau&s;e, which (as it re&s;pects the people) is not true, however it may be with the government.</P>
<P>Whereupon, re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of this county, that, if the &s;aid treaty &s;hould be ratified, the United States, &s;o far as it re&s;pects their commercial &s;ituation, are far wor&s;e than colonial.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the thanks of the citizens of this county be given to the ten patriotic &s;enators, who voted again&s;t the ratification of the &s;aid treaty, in the &s;enate of the United States.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the thanks of the citizens of this county be given to S. T. Ma&s;on, one of the &s;enators from Virginia, for his firmne&s;s in publi&s;hing the treaty, &s;o long kept &s;ecret from the good citizens of the&s;e &s;tates, by which means they are made &s;en&s;ible of their dangerous &s;ituation, and enabled to expre&s;s their di&s;approbation thereof.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of this coun|ty, that the &s;aid treaty has a general tendency to mi&s;lead the people, and to re&s;trict the legi&s;lative powers of congre&s;s, and is a mo&s;t flagrant violation of the federal con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="028389_0565_0FD8ECE5068835F0">

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR fortitude excites our admiration, your virtue, our e&s;teem, and your attention to our intere&s;t, our gratitude. Be a&s;&s;ured your oppo&s;ition, in the federal &s;enate, to the ratifi|cation of the treaty, &s;igned at London on the 19th of Novem|ber, 1794, has our fulle&s;t approbation, and merits, our warme&s;t applau&s;e and firme&s;t &s;upport. We, &s;ir, have examined it with care, and anxiou&s;ly &s;ought that reciprocity which is &s;o artfully held up as the ba&s;is of friend&s;hip; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, only find it cautiou&s;ly worded, and wonderfully calculated to deceive the good citizens of the&s;e &s;tates, by holding up phan|toms as though they had exi&s;tence, and repre&s;enting <HI>ideal</HI> as though they were <HI>real</HI> advantages. We conceive it altogether illu&s;ory, as to any &s;en&s;ible or po&s;&s;ible good that can re&s;ult to the United States as a government, or the citizens thereof as individuals. We are &s;orry to &s;ay, that in this treaty, we be|hold our con&s;titution violated, our commerce bartered for illu|&s;ions, our allies ju&s;tly led to di&s;tru&s;t us, and we our&s;elves made the &s;port of caprice and Briti&s;h polities. We think the treaty altogether nugatory, as to the end propo&s;ed, and highly dero|gatory

We lament there were no more, yet we rejoice there were &s;o many, in the &s;enate, who &s;poke the language and acted the will of the people. This is but a tribute due to patrioti&s;m, and we rejoice, &s;ir, to pay it to you. While natives forge the language and &s;entiments of free-born citizens of the&s;e &s;tates, what do we behold! A man not by chance of birth an American, but one by <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and by choice, who is more firmly attached to the federal government, and the dignity thereof, that even its indigenous &s;ons.

<P><HI>The following Features of Mr. Jay's Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, with Great Britain, are pre&s;ented, through the Medium of your Independent Gazetteer, to the &s;erious Con&s;ide|ration and calm Reflection of the Citizens of the United States.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. IT begets a ba&s;e and unnatural political connexion between a republican government and a monarchy.</P>
<P N="2">II. It &s;acrifices to that connexion, pa&s;t injuries, a reparation for wrongs, and the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of commerce, that an independent nation can yield.</P>
<P N="3">III. It pro&s;trates the con&s;titution of the United States, at the feet of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, rendering that fundamen|tal charter of our rights any thing or nothing, as the pre&s;i|dent and &s;enate &s;hall, in their di&s;cretion, by treaty determine.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="279" REF="028389_0567_0FD8ECEBCC3C5AD0">
IV. It declares war again&s;t the independent and con&s;titu|tional rights of congre&s;s, by attempting to take away their power to decide on any que&s;tion &s;imilar to tho&s;e propo&s;ed in the &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s before the la&s;t, by Me&s;&s;rs. Madi&s;on, Dayton, and Clarke: viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Mr. Madi&s;on's, for re&s;tricting the commerce with Great Britain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mr. Dayton's, for &s;eque&s;tering Briti&s;h property.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Mr. Clarke's, for &s;u&s;pending the commercial intercour&s;e with Great Britain.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="5">V. It enlarges the ground of this warfare, by attempting to dive&s;t congre&s;s of the power</P>
<P>To regulate trade and intercour&s;e with the Indian tribes;</P>
<P>To levy and collect duties of impo&s;t and exci&s;e;</P>
<P>To define and puni&s;h piracies on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations;</P>
<P>To grant letters of marque and repri&s;al;</P>
<P>To declare war&mdash;</P>
<P>An which powers are, by the con&s;titution of the United States, expre&s;sly ve&s;ted in congre&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It &s;eeks to maintain this warfare, by arraying the pre&s;i|dent and &s;enate, &s;upported by Great Britain, on one &s;ide, again&s;t the repre&s;entatives of the people, their con&s;tituents, and the con&s;titution of the United States, on the other &s;ide; thus introducing foreign intrigue and influence into our public councils and dome&s;tic politics, and engendering cau&s;es of di&s;af|fection, di&s;union, and intrigue.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It in&s;idiou&s;ly aims to di&s;&s;olve all connexion between the United States and France, and to &s;ub&s;titute a monarchic, for a republican ally; virtually, if not expre&s;sly, violating our neu|trality, in the following in&s;tances:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By admitting and legalizing &s;eizures for adjudication, in all ca&s;es of &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy, articles which are contraband of war.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By declaring to be contraband "all timber for &s;hip-build|ing, tar or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp and cordage, and, generally, whatever may &s;erve directly for the equipment of ve&s;&s;els."&mdash;ALTHOUGH GREAT BRITAIN, IN HER COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH FRANCE, HAD HER|SELF DECLARED THOSE VERY ARTICLES NOT TO BE CONTRABAND.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By admitting &s;eizures of ve&s;&s;els laden with provi&s;ions, in all ca&s;es, under the frivolous pretext of "difficulty of agree|ing
<PB N="280" REF="028389_0568_0FD8BEA1A57F1B18">on the preci&s;e ca&s;es, in which alone, provi&s;ions and other articles not generally contraband, may be regarded as &s;uch."</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By placing Great Britain on the footing of the mo&s;t fa|vored nation, and &s;tipulating "That no prohibition &s;hall be im|po&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any articles, to or from the territories of the two parties, re&s;pectively, which &s;hall not extend to all other nations."</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. By bettering the condition of Great Britain, pending the war with France; thereby increa&s;ing her re&s;ources, and ena|bling her to pro&s;ecute and continue the war with that republic.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="8">VIII. It records and perpetuates the di&s;honor of America, and the political depravity of her government; exhibiting the &s;ad &s;pectacle of the United States, &s;ervilely cringing to the cor|rupt monarchy of Great Britain, for a clo&s;e and intimate alli|ance, at the &s;acrifice of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential political and com|mercial intere&s;ts; whil&s;t, pointing the finger of ho&s;tility to France, it &s;eeks, in the hour of her difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s, to wound that magnanimous republic, which was no le&s;s the in|&s;trument of American emancipation from Briti&s;h tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, than &s;he is now the guarantee of that independ|ence, which we have thus &s;o &s;hamefully abu&s;ed, by negociating the pre&s;ent inglorious and di&s;graceful treaty.</P>

<HEAD>"There is nothing new under the &s;un."</HEAD>
<P>THAT I deny; for it mu&s;t be a new thing to all the world to read the &s;entiments of the pre&s;ident of the United States, who know that he is the &s;ame identical man who was, during the late American war, the commander in chief of the American army.</P>
<P>As a &s;mall proof&mdash;in his late an&s;wer to the merchants and traders in the city of Philadelphia, who approved of the treaty, he has the following very extraordinary expre&s;&s;ion: "Such &s;entiments, deliberately formed, and proceeding from men who&s;e intere&s;ts are <HI>more immediately concerned</HI> than tho&s;e of any other cla&s;s of citizens."</P>
<P>Has the adulation, which has been poured upon him, from all quarters, for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, &s;o bewildered his &s;en&s;es, that, relinqui&s;hing even common decency, he tells 408
<PB N="281" REF="028389_0569_0FD8ECF3E9F159B8">merchants and traders of the city of Philadelphia, "that they are more immediately concerned than any other cla&s;s of his fellow citizens," in a treaty, which embraces &s;o many various and important objects, in no re&s;pect connected with trade or commerce?</P>
<P>A treaty &s;o repugnant to the &s;entiments of the be&s;t patriots of this country, as to have occa&s;ioned a manly, firm, but con|&s;titutional oppo&s;ition, from one end of the continent to the other.</P>
<P>An oppo&s;ition which he ought to have re&s;pected&mdash;an oppo&s;i|tion which mu&s;t and will be re&s;pected&mdash;an oppo&s;ition that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, ultimately, while con&s;titutionally, enforce all that &s;ucce&s;s which it &s;o ju&s;tly merits.</P>
<P>A treaty which children cannot read without di&s;covering that it tends to di&s;unite us from our pre&s;ent ally, and unite us to a government which we abhor, dete&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>A government, which, in compliance with his &s;entiments, often expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t energetic terms, when he was our worthy commander in chief, our children were learned to li&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their dete&s;tation of.</P>
<P>Has that government altered its &s;y&s;tem of arrogance and de&s;|poti&s;m? Or has he altered his &s;entiments of freedom?</P>
<P>That it continues the &s;ame, is certain; that the is greatly changed, I mo&s;t firmly believe.</P>
<P>Should this conduct produce a &s;erious rupture among&s;t our|&s;elves (which God forbid) how many of the&s;e 408 would court the honor of being his body guard, provided he &s;hould think proper to expo&s;e him&s;elf to danger?</P>
<P>How many of them have mo&s;t fervently prayed for his and our de&s;truction, during the late war?</P>
<P>Ought he not to have con&s;idered, that many among&s;t tho&s;e who addre&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ame city, reque&s;ting that he would <HI>not</HI> ratify the treaty, &s;tood, in the public view, among&s;t the foremo&s;t and mo&s;t &s;incere friends of their country; and are employed, at this moment, in &s;ome of its highe&s;t offices and tru&s;ts?</P>
<P>Does his an&s;wer to them, in point of complai&s;ance and po|litene&s;s, <HI>though they con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal thou&s;ands,</HI> bear any analo|gy to that tran&s;mitted to the 408 merchants and traders?&mdash;Who, I hope, to prevent mi&s;takes, will for ever hereafter be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the <HI>&s;ignificant</HI> title of, "<HI>The pre&s;ident's</HI> 408 <HI>re|&s;pectable friends in the city of Philadelphia.</HI>"</P>
<P>And, that their real re&s;pectability may be more fully verifi|ed, I mo&s;t &s;incerely hope, further, that their ab&s;olute occupa|tions&mdash;the yearly amount of their dealings&mdash;their political &s;en|timents
<PB N="282" REF="028389_0570_0FD8ECF5ABAC5FC8">and actions during the late war&mdash;the length of time they have been real citizens of America, &amp;c. will be exhibited to public view, by &s;ome impartial biographer, in a hand&s;ome volume, neatly gilt and lettered, like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I go farther than this &s;tate, to &s;how the im|propriety of his expre&s;&s;ion, or the re&s;pectability of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e his pre&s;ent wi&s;hes?</P>
<P>At his own table (it was an expre&s;&s;ion made u&s;e of for the public ear, or it would not now be revealed by me) I have heard him ob&s;erve, in an hour of his own and of his country's mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s, that "the people of the United States ought to be particularly thankful to a kind Providence, through who&s;e con&s;picuous bounty, George Clinton had been appoint|ed governor of the &s;tate of New York;" and yet this very Mr. Clinton, if I am not very much mi&s;informed, is as un&s;haken an opponent to the treaty, as any man in the United States.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, on the other hand, who are the mo&s;t numerous, the only con&s;olidated cla&s;s of inhabitants (for many of them are not citizens) who &s;peak in favor of it?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer flu&s;hes on my mind quick as lightning: every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, who, in our &s;truggle for obtaining a right to e&s;tabli&s;h that government which enabled us to fix the pre&s;ident in his pre&s;ent exalted &s;tation, was known to him and us, as our in|dividual and joint enemy, by the de&s;picable title of tory, as he and we then e&s;teemed, in a political point of view, the men of that de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But, gracious heaven, what a change has this deleterious in|&s;trument effected? Not a man of that de&s;cription now, who does not &s;peak of the pre&s;ident as of an angel from heaven, and of the treaty, as a gift of the fir&s;t magnitude, procured through his divine influence, as the only remedy again&s;t the errors of republicani&s;m, and the influence of the rabble!</P>
<P>Tho&s;e men, too, while they are the warme&s;t friends of the pre&s;ident, are the mo&s;t inveterate enemies of a Clinton, a Jef|fer&s;on, a Burr, a Madi&s;on, and all others who embrace, or even countenance their &s;entiments and opinions.</P>
<P>Reflection, on this uncommon in&s;tance of human incon&s;i&s;t|ency, leads me to a very weighty que&s;tion, which I mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly entreat the pre&s;ident to an&s;wer to him&s;elf, having fir&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the unexampled change both of his friends and oppo&s;ers, from Georgia to New Hamp&s;hire: It is this; Have your old friends de&s;erted you? Or have you de&s;erted what was formerly yours, and &s;till is their favorite cau&s;e, "The rights of man?"</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="028389_0571_0FD8ECF75F45FB40">
This que&s;tion comes not from an anarchi&s;t, but from one who loved, admired, re&s;pected, revered, and almo&s;t adored, General Wa&s;hington, and who has received the written thanks of that great man, for his exertions in that cau&s;e, of which his beloved commander in chief was then the great defender.</P>
<P>Gratitude and re&s;pect for the virtuous conduct of his for|mer general will never be obliterated from his mind; and a due obedience to his pre&s;ent pre&s;ident &s;hall be punctually paid, as long as the love of his country, and a determina|tion to pre&s;erve its con&s;titution unimpaired, can po&s;&s;ibly admit.</P>

<P>The committee, appointed by the town, to con&s;ider the treaty entered into by Mr. Jay with the government of Great Britain, beg leave to report as follows:</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on have, at la&s;t, to the honor and advan|tage of mankind, decided que&s;tions long ob&s;cured by ignorance, and conte&s;ted by de&s;poti&s;m.

<P><PB N="284" REF="028389_0572_0FD8ECFB94FA7BC0">
This right may be more important in its operation, but can|not be dimini&s;hed, by the numbers a&s;&s;ociated to exerci&s;e it&mdash; whether the a&s;&s;ociation be <HI>&s;elf-created,</HI> or grounded on the imperious authority of tho&s;e who are only the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of the public.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the town of Plymouth, &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed with the above &s;entiments, &s;o congenial to their con|duct in the American revolution&mdash;alarmed by the ruinous na|ture and tendency of the treaty, lately negociated by Mr. Jay, with the king of Great Britain, have thought it their duty, on this occa&s;ion, to a&s;&s;emble in town-meeting, to give their marked and decided reprobation of the &s;aid treaty, in all its parts.</P>
<P>The numerous objections to this treaty have been &s;o fully detailed, &s;o forcibly &s;tated, and &s;o conclu&s;ively deduced from its &s;everal parts, by many very re&s;pectable meetings of citizens, as not only to preclude the nece&s;&s;ity, but propriety, of a repetition.

<P>Before we conclude the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting, our duty impels us to the more plea&s;ing ta&s;k of expre&s;&s;ing our re&s;pect and gratitude to the ten &s;enators of the minority, who&s;e patri|oti&s;m formed an honorable oppo&s;ition: and particularly to one of them, who drew from &s;ecrecy and darkne&s;s, and expo&s;ed to the public vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, the treaty, before it had arrived to its &s;tage of maturity. We place our hopes and confidence in divine providence, &s;o often and &s;o &s;ignally interpo&s;ed in favor of Ame|rica, and, under that, in the virtue and patrioti&s;m of the con|gre&s;s of the United States, to relieve our apprehen&s;ions, by their adopting &s;uch mea&s;ures, as &s;hall effectually &s;ecure us again&s;t the impending dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the treaty with Great Britain.</P>

<HEAD>Wa&s;hington Re&s;olutions.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At a Meeting of the Citizens, Inhabitants of <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> Di&s;trict, in the State of <HI>South Carolina,</HI> the Treaty of Amity, Com|merce, and Navigation, between his Britannic Maje&s;ty, and the United States of America, concluded at London, on the 19th Day of November, <HI>1794</HI>&mdash;was taken into Con&s;ideration, when the following Re&s;olutions, expre&s;&s;ive of their Sentiments on the Subject, were entered into.</HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, That although an undue, and over-jea|lou&s;y of public officers is often, in its con&s;equences, im|politic; yet freemen always have the right, and in many ca&s;es it becomes their ab&s;olute duty, to exerci&s;e that right, of enquir|ing fully, and with freedom, into the mea&s;ures and conduct of the &s;ervants of the public. On this occa&s;ion, the magnitude of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of deliberation, and the ruinous con&s;e|quences of Mr. Jay's treaty, if finally ratified, to the trade, agriculture, and various intere&s;ts of the United States of Ame|rica, induce us to join our other fellow citizens in oppo&s;ing a &s;y&s;tem founded on inequality, and on principles of them&s;elves, as to one party, unequal and unju&s;t; and we will, in expre&s;&s;ing this our di&s;approbation, point out a few of the many injuries that America would feel from the operation of the &s;aid treaty.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the re&s;triction on American ve&s;&s;els trading to the We&s;t Indies, to 70 tons, and all remittances of We&s;t In|dia produce made in them confined to American markets only; and the prohibiting cotton to be exported from America, unle&s;s in Briti&s;h bottoms, though the product of our own country, and now becoming a valuable and increa&s;ing &s;taple in South Caro|lina and Georgia, whil&s;t Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els of any tonnage, with or without excepted articles, are allowed to trade to any port or place they plea&s;e; is a manife&s;t inju&s;tice to America, and de|grading to her as a nation, having neither equivalent nor reci|procity on her &s;ide, and ought, therefore, to be di&s;carded as incompatible with her honor and intere&s;t as a &s;overeign and in|dependent government.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the board or court of judicature, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the 6th article of the treaty, is highly dangerous; as the mode of procedure and the kind of te&s;timony to be admitted, are in the brea&s;ts of the judges only, and are not to be confined to any of the known rules of law or equity. Add to this, a majority of the judges may be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who will be deciding between the United States and their fellow &s;ubjects, for

<P>Re&s;olved, That it is impolitic and unju&s;t for the United States to oblige them&s;elves to make good the defalcations of the debts of the Briti&s;h creditors in America, for a &s;uppo&s;ed infrac|tion of the treaty of 1783, when no &s;atisfaction is made by the Briti&s;h government to America, for the injury done her by the detention of the po&s;ts, or for the thou&s;ands of negroes car|ried off from her citizens in direct violation of that treaty.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the apparent equal right of the parties mu|tually to &s;ettle, and carry on trade, on the ea&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, is ill founded and fallacious; as the Briti&s;h, long &s;ince, had ceded to the Spani&s;h government all claims of ter|ritory they had on the &s;aid river to the &s;outh of the 31&s;t de|gree of north latitude, the now &s;outh boundary of the United States; and to the north up the &s;aid river, they them&s;elves think they have no claim, otherwi&s;e their plenipotentiary, Mr. Grenville, would not have &s;uppo&s;ed that a line running due we&s;t from the lake of the Woods would pa&s;s above the &s;ource of that river, and on that &s;uppo&s;ition had an article put in their treaty with us, appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to a&s;certain and fix that part of the boundary: therefore, the allowing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to make &s;ettlements and e&s;tabli&s;h factories, if they choo&s;e, on the banks of the &s;aid river, is giving them privileges they have no colour of right to, and that without an equivalent on our part: a privilege, which, in the event, from their man|ner of trade and influence among the numerous tribes of Indi|ans, might endanger the peace of the United States. Al&s;o, we conceive the right given by treaty to both parties to u&s;e in common the bays, rivers, creeks, ports, harbours, &amp;c. is une|qual, and leaves the&s;e &s;tates without a &s;ufficient equivalent for the advantages they give up&mdash;for whil&s;t a Briti&s;h &s;ubject has a right to pa&s;s, &s;ettle and trade, where and how he plea&s;es in any part of the United States, a citizen of America is prohibited from trading, or even going into the limits of the territory of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, the only part of his Britannic ma|je&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in North America, where it would be advan|tageous to have the privilege, as nearly the whole of the fur trade with the northern tribes of Indians pa&s;&s;es through that channel.</P>

<P>That under this conviction, they &s;ubmit the following ob&s;er|vations to the con&s;ideration of the general a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="1">I. Even "waving the merits of the re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions of the two parties," as to the inexecution of the trea|ty of peace, it is rea&s;onable to view the two parties as equally culpable, or equally blamele&s;s, and to determine that the exe|cution
<PB N="5" REF="028389_0581_0FD8ED1395ACF340">of the treaty of peace equally by both ought to have been provided for. Yet, whil&s;t the United States are to comply, in the mo&s;t ample manner, with the article unfulfilled by them, and to make compen&s;ation for whatever lo&s;&s;es may have accrued from their delay; Great Britain is relea&s;ed altogether, from one of the articles unfulfilled by her, and is not obliged to make the &s;malle&s;t compen&s;ation for the damages which have accrued from her delay, in fulfilling the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e equitable and reciprocal claims of the United States are not even allowed the chance of arbitration.</P>
<P>This inequality of terms, is greatly aggravated by other con|ce&s;&s;ions, on the part of the United States, which, be&s;ides adding to the violation of the con&s;titution, artfully introduced in this treaty, may, in a great mea&s;ure, defeat the good con&s;e|quences of a &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, if that article of the treaty &s;hould be faithfully executed by Great Britain.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;ettlers and traders, within an indefinite tract of country, are allowed to retain both their land and allegiance at the &s;ame time, and con&s;equently to keep up a foreign and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> influence over the Indians, within the limits of the United States.</P>
<P>The Indians, within the&s;e li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, are encouraged to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> their trade with the Briti&s;h, by the permi&s;&s;ion to bring their goods, <HI>duty free,</HI> from Canada, where the goods being charged with no &s;uch impo&s;t as is payable on the goods of the United States, will be offered for &s;ale with that tempting preference; a regulation al&s;o, but too likely to cloak the fraud of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng traders in a country otherwi&s;e favorable to them.</P>
<P>Under a like &s;emblance of reciprocity, the advantage &s;ecured to the United States in the fur trade, by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the carrying places, is abandoned to the &s;uperiority of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h capital, and the <HI>in&s;ecurity</HI> of the Canada duty or duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n impo&s;ts.</P>
<P>A part only of the po&s;ts, harbours, and bays, of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gle Briti&s;h province, is made free to the citizens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> United Briti&s;h province, is made free to the citizens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> United States, in con&s;ideration of a freedom of all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, har|bours, and bays, to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The goods and merchan|dize of the United States not entirely prohibited by Canada (but which, in fact, are always prohibited, when partial and temporary admi&s;&s;ions are not dictated by nece&s;&s;ity) may be car|ried there in con&s;ideration of a free admi&s;&s;ion from Canada, of all goods and merchandize not entirely prohibited by the United States, where there never is, in fact, this entire prohibition. A like &s;tipulation, liable to the like ob&s;ervation, is extended to the exports of the United States, and the province of Canada.
<PB N="6" REF="028389_0582_0FD8ED152AFA3A50">There are further in&s;tances of a nominal and delu&s;ive recipro|city.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, there is not even an often&s;ible or nominal reciprocity. The po&s;ts and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, are to be equally free to both parties; although the treaty it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es that the cour&s;e of the northern boundary of the United States, will throw the Briti&s;h beyond the very &s;ource of that river. This item of the treaty is the more to be noticed, as a repetition and exten&s;ion, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, of the &s;tipulated privileges of Great Britain on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, will be con&s;trued into a partiality in the United States, to the intere&s;ts and views of that nation on the American continent, not likely to conciliate tho&s;e from whom an amicable adju&s;tment of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi is expected; and was, no doubt, intended by Great Britain as a &s;nare to our good under&s;tanding with the nation mo&s;t jealous of her encroachment and aggrandizement.</P>
<P N="2">II. Without remarking the inexplicit provi&s;ion for redre&s;&s;ing pa&s;t &s;poliations and vexations, no &s;ufficient precautions are taken again&s;t them in future. On the contrary, by omitting to provide for the re&s;pect due to &s;ea-letters, pa&s;&s;ports and cer|tificates, and for other cu&s;tomary &s;afe-guards to neutral ve&s;&s;els, "a general &s;earch warrant" (in the &s;trong, but ju&s;t language if our fellow citizens of Charle&s;ton) is granted again&s;t the A|merican navigation. Examples of &s;uch provi&s;ions were to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d in our other treaties, as well as in the treaties of other nations. And it is matter of ju&s;t &s;urprize, that they &s;hould have no place in a treaty with Great Britain, who&s;e conduct on the &s;eas, &s;o particularly &s;ugge&s;ted and enforced every guard to our rights that could be rea&s;onably in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>By omitting to provide again&s;t the arbitrary &s;eizure and im|pri&s;onment of the American &s;eamen, that valuable cla&s;s of ci|tizens remains expo&s;ed to all the outrages, and our commerce to all the interruptions, hitherto experienced from that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>By enpre&s;sly admitting, that provi&s;ions are to be held contra|band, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other than when bound to an inve&s;ted place, and implie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">itting that &s;uch ca&s;es exi&s;t at pre&s;ent&mdash;not only retro&s;pective &s;anction may be given to proceedings again&s;t which an indemnification is claimed, but an apparent licen&s;e is granted to fre&s;h and more rapacious depredations on our lawful commerce; and facts &s;eem to &s;how, that &s;uch is to be the fruit of this impolitic conce&s;&s;ion. It is conceived, that the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">text, &s;et up by Great Britain, of be&s;ieging and &s;tarving whole nations, and the doctrine grounded thereon, of a right to in|tercept the cu&s;tomary trade of neutral nations, in articles not contraband, ought never to have been admitted into a treaty

<ITEM>2. It appears, that the doctrine was denied by the executive, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with Mr. Hammond, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, and that demands of compen&s;ation, founded on that denial, are now depending.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As provi&s;ions con&s;titute not le&s;s than two-thirds of our exports, and Great Britain is nearly half her time at war, an admi&s;&s;ion of the doctrine &s;acrifices, in a corre&s;pond|ent degree, the intrin&s;ic value of our country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. After a public denial of the doctrine, to admit it, in the mid&s;t of the pre&s;ent war, by a formal treaty, would have but too much of the ef|fect, as well as the appearance, of voluntarily concurring in the &s;cheme of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a nation, who&s;e friendly relations to the United States, as well as the &s;truggles for freedom in which it is engaged, give a title to every good office which is permitted by a ju&s;t regard to our own intere&s;t, and not &s;trictly forbidden by the duties of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">trality.</ITEM>

<P>Briti&s;h treaties have done the &s;ame; nor, as is believed, do the treaties of any nation in Europe, producing the&s;e articles for exportation, allow them to be &s;ubjects of confi&s;cation. The &s;tipulation was the le&s;s to be admitted, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y a&s;|&s;umed by it, is a mere cover for the violation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that princi|ple&mdash;mo&s;t of the articles in que&s;tion, being among the exports of the United States, whil&s;t all of them are among the imports of Great Britain.</P>
<P>By expre&s;sly &s;tipulating with Great Britain, again&s;t the free|dom of enemy's property in neutral bottoms, the progre&s;s to|wards a complete and formal e&s;tabli&s;hment of a principle in the law of nations, &s;o favorable to the general intere&s;t and &s;ecurity of commerce, receives all the check the United States could give to it. Rea&s;on and experience have long taught the pro|priety of con&s;idering free &s;hips as giving freedom to their car|goes.
<PB N="8" REF="028389_0584_0FD8ED1B16028198">The &s;everal great maritime nations of Europe, have not only e&s;tabli&s;hed, at different times, by their treaties with each other, but, on a &s;olemn occa&s;ion, jointly declared it to be the law of nations, by a &s;pecific compact, of which the United States entered their entire approbation (&s;ee their act of the 5th of October, 1780). Great Britain alone di&s;&s;ented. But &s;he her|&s;elf, in a variety of prior treaties, and in a treaty with France, &s;ince, has acceded to the principle. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the United States, of all nations, ought to be the la&s;t to com|bine in a retrograde effort on this &s;ubject, as being, more than any other, intere&s;ted in extending and e&s;tabli&s;hing the commer|cial rights of neutral nations.&mdash;Their &s;ituation particularly fits them to be carriers for the great nations of Europe, during their wars; and both their &s;ituation, and the genius of their government and people, promi&s;e them a greater &s;hare of peace and neutrality, than can be expected by any other nation&mdash;The relation of the United States by a treaty on this point, to the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"> of Great Britain, was another rea&s;on for avoiding this &s;tipulation.

So that when the principle is in favor of the United States, the principle it&s;elf is to be the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; when the prin|ciple is in favor of Great Britain, the application of it only, is to be the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">III. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever the law of nations has been a topic for con|&s;ideration, the re&s;ult of the treaty accommodates Great Britain in relation to one, or both of the republics at war with her, as well as in the abandonment of the rights and intere&s;ts of the United States.</P>
<P>Thus American ve&s;&s;els bound to Great Britain, are protect|ed by &s;ea papers, again&s;t French and Dutch &s;earches; but when bound to France or Holland, are left expo&s;ed to Briti&s;h &s;earches, without regard to &s;uch papers.</P>

<P>Briti&s;h property, in American ve&s;&s;els, is not &s;ubject to French or Dutch confi&s;cation&mdash;French or Dutch property in American ve&s;&s;els, is &s;ubjected to Briti&s;h confi&s;cation.

<P>American citizens entering as volunteers in the &s;ervice of France or Holland, are puni&s;hable: but American volunteers joining the arms of Great Britain again&s;t France or Holland, are not puni&s;hable.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, and privateers with their prizes, made on citizens of Holland, may freely enter and depart the ports of the United States; but Dutch &s;hips of war, and private<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with their prizes, made on &s;ubjects of Great Britain, are to receive no &s;helter or refuge in the ports of the United States. &mdash;This advantage in war is given to Great Britain, not by a treaty prior to an exi&s;ting war, but by a treaty made in the mid&s;t of war, and expre&s;sly &s;tipulating again&s;t a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> article of treaty, with the other party, for equalizing the advantage.</P>
<P>The article prohibiting confi&s;cations and &s;eque&s;trations, is unequal between Great Britain and the United States; Ameri|can citizens have little, if any, intere&s;t in private or bank &s;tock, or private debts, within Great Britain. So, where much would be in the power of the United States, and little in the power of Great Britain, the power is interdicted: Where more is in the power of Great Britain than of the United States, the power is unconfined. Another remark is applicable&mdash;When the modern u&s;age of nations is in favor of Great Britain, the modern u&s;age is the rule of the treaty; but when the modern u&s;age is in favor of the United States, the modern u&s;age is re|jected, as a rule for the treaty.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The footing on which the treaty places the &s;ubject of commerce, is liable to in&s;uperable objections. 1. The nature of our exports and imports, compared with tho&s;e of other countries, and particularly of Great Britain, has been thought, by the legi&s;lature of the United States, to ju&s;tify certain dif|ferences, in the tonnage and other duties, in favor of Ameri|can bottoms; and the advantage po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Great Britain, in her &s;uperior capital, was thought, at the &s;ame time, to require &s;uch countervailing encouragements. Experience has &s;hown the &s;olidity of both the&s;e con&s;iderations. The American na|vigation
<PB N="10" REF="028389_0586_0FD8ED21CAE25C98">has, in a good degree, been protected, again&s;t the ad|vantage on the &s;ide of Briti&s;h capital, and has increa&s;ed in proportion; whil&s;t the nature of our exports, being generally nece&s;&s;aries, or raw materials, and our imports con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of Briti&s;h manufactures, has re&s;trained the di&s;po&s;ition of Great Britain to counteract the protecting duties afforded to our na|vigation. If the treaty is carried into effect, this protection is relinqui&s;hed, and congre&s;s are prohibited from &s;ub&s;tituting any other. Then the Briti&s;h capital, having no longer the pre&s;ent inducement to make u&s;e of American bottoms, may be ex|pected, in whatever hands operating, to give the preference to Briti&s;h bottoms.</P>
<P N="2">2. The provi&s;ions of the treaty, which relate to the We&s;t Indies, where the nature of our exports and imports gives a commanding energy to our ju&s;t preten&s;ions, in&s;tead of allevi|ating the general evil, are a detail of particular humiliations and &s;acrifices. Nor will a remedy by any means be found, in a revi&s;ion of that part alone of the treaty.</P>
<P>If Great Britain &s;hould accede to the propo&s;ition of the &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, and the treaty be finally e&s;tabli&s;hed, without that part of it, but in all its other parts: She will, in that event, be able to exclude American bottoms altogether from the channel of intercour&s;e, and to regulate the whole trade with the We&s;t Indies, in the manner heretofore complained of, whil&s;t the United States will be completely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right and the means of counteracting monopoly, unle&s;s they &s;ubmit to an univer&s;al infraction of their trade, not excepting with nations who&s;e regulations may be reciprocal and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P N="3">3. The treaty, not content with the&s;e injuries to the United States, in their commerce with Great Britain, provides, in the 15th article, again&s;t the improvement or pre&s;ervation of their commerce with other nations, by any beneficial treaties that may be attainable.&mdash;The general rule of the United States, in their treaties, &s;ounded on the example of other nations, has been, that where a nation is to have the privileges of the mo&s;t favored nations, it &s;hall be admitted gratuitou&s;ly to &s;uch privi|leges only as may be gratuitou&s;ly granted, but &s;hall pay, for privileges not gratuitou&s;ly granted, the compen&s;ation paid by others; this prudent and equitable qualification of the footing of the mo&s;t favored nation, was particularly requi&s;ite in a treaty with Great Britain, who&s;e commercial &s;y&s;tem, in rela|tion to other countries, being matured and &s;ettled, is not likely to be varied by grants of new privileges that might re&s;ult to the United States. It was peculiarly requi&s;ite, at the pre&s;ent juncture, al&s;o, when an advantageous revi&s;ion of the treaty
<PB N="11" REF="028389_0587_0FD8ED24DFE36420">with France is &s;aid to be favored by that republic; when a trea|ty with Spain is actually in negociation; and when treaties with other nations, who&s;e commerce is important to the United States, cannot be out of contemplation.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ed treaty, neverthele&s;s, puts Great Britain, in all re&s;pects, gratuitou&s;ly, on the footing of the nations mo&s;t fa|vored, even as to the future privileges, for which the mo&s;t valuable con&s;iderations may be given; &s;o that it is not only out of the power of the United States to grant any peculiar privileges to any other nation, as an equivalent for peculiar advantages in commerce or navigation, granted to the United States; but every nation, de&s;iring to treat on this &s;ubject with the United States, is reduced to the alternative, either of declining the treaty altogether, or of including Great Britain, gratuitou&s;ly, in all the privileges it purcha&s;es for it&s;elf. An article of this import is the greate&s;t ob&s;truction, next to an ab&s;olute prohi|bition, that could have been thrown in the way of other trea|ties; and that it was in&s;idiou&s;ly meant by Great Britain to be &s;uch, is rendered the le&s;s doubtful, by the kindred features of the treaty.</P>
<P N="4">4. It can be no apology for the commercial di&s;advantages, that better terms could not be obtained. <HI>If proper terms could not be obtained, at that time, commercial articles, which were no wi&s;e e&s;&s;entially connected with the objects of the emba&s;&s;y, ought to have waited for a more favorable &s;ea&s;on.</HI> Nor is a better apolo|gy to be drawn from our other treaties. The&s;e not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id many of the &s;acrifices in the new treaty; but the chief of them were the guarantees or the auxiliaries of our indepen|dence; and, in that view, would have been an equivalent for greater commercial conce&s;&s;ions than were in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P N="5">V. The pre&s;ident and &s;enate, by ratifying this treaty, u&s;urp the power of regulating commerce, of making rules with re|&s;pect to aliens, of e&s;tabli&s;hing tribunals of ju&s;tice, and of de|fining piracy. A formal demon&s;tration of every part of this complex propo&s;ition is not requi&s;ite. We will prove, that this treaty is dangerous to liberty, and that the con&s;tituted autho|rities, who have given it their &s;anction, have flagrantly vio|lated their duty, by an appeal to the con&s;titution it&s;elf, to that explicit in&s;trument, which we formed as the unerring guide of our repre&s;entatives, but which &s;ome of them have dared to violate.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A treaty, thus incompatible with our con&s;titution, thus unequal in its conditions, thus derogating from our national rights, thus in&s;idious in &s;ome of its objects, and thus alarm|ing in all its operations, is not only unworthy of the voluntary
<PB N="12" REF="028389_0588_0FD8ED2646E9DDF0">acceptance of an independent and happy people, but is an abject &s;acrifice, which ought to have been rejected with di&s;dain, in the mo&s;t humiliating and adver&s;e circum&s;tances. It is &s;in|cerely believed, that &s;uch a treaty would not have been li&s;tened to at any former period, even when Great Britain was mo&s;t powerful, and the United States mo&s;t feeble. <HI>To pretend, that, however objectionable the in&s;trument may be, it ought to be con&s;i|dered as the only e&s;cape from a ho&s;tile re&s;entment of Great Britain, which would evidently be as impolitic, as it would be unju&s;t on her part,</HI> IS AN ARTIFICE TOO CONTEMPTI|BLE TO ANSWER ITS PURPOSE. It will not ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a refu&s;al to part with our rights, without equivalents, will be made the pretext of war on us; much le&s;s that &s;uch a pretext will be founded on our refu&s;al, to mingle a &s;acrifice of our commerce and navigation, with an adju&s;tment of political differences. Neither is there any evi|dence in hi&s;tory, or in human nature, that nations are to be bribed out of the &s;pirit of encroachment and aggre&s;&s;ion, by humiliations, which nouri&s;h their pride, or by unrea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions, which extend their re&s;ources and their power.

<P>The petitioners, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lying our the wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m of the general a&s;&s;embly, pray that the objections to the treaty, compri&s;ed in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, may be taken into their &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration; and that &s;uch mea&s;ures towards a remedy may be pur&s;ued, as may be judge mo&s;t conformable to the nature of the ca&s;e, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tant with con&s;titutional principles.</P>

<P>When he can &s;eize a &s;ingle &s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment, in any writer on the laws of nations, that favors this part of the treaty, he lays as much &s;tre&s;s upon his opinions as the prie&s;ts of Apollo ever did on the Delphian oracles. But every opinion oppo&s;ed to his, however &s;anctioned&mdash;every fact, however well authenticated, he endeavours to invalidate or explain away.&mdash;Artful and &s;o|phi&s;t as he is, he has, by one &s;ingle &s;entence, overturned the fabric he has expended &s;o much time to erect. He has conceded enough to &s;atisfy every rational man of the fallacy of his ar|guments.

<P>But le&s;t it &s;hould be pretended, that a &s;trained as unwar|ranted con&s;truction is put on his words, I &s;hall give the &s;en|tence at length, that the reader may judge for him&s;elf: "It would have been an ine&s;timable gem in our political con&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion, had it contained a po&s;itive &s;tipulation again&s;t &s;uch a practice (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of &s;eque&s;tration and confi&s;cation) except, perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> WAY OF REPRISAL FOR THE IDENTICAL, INJU|RY, ON THE PART OF ANOTHER NATION.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e, further, that the aggrieved nation had, in its own territory, property of the &s;ubjects of the other nation, of equal value with that which had been thus piratically plunder|ed, would it not be a right, nay a duty, to &s;eize it, for the purpo&s;e of making re&s;titution to the &s;ufferers?

<P>SINCE the clo&s;ing of my la&s;t number, I have accidentally turned to a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Vattel,</HI> which is &s;o pertinent to the immediate &s;ubject of that paper, that I cannot refrain from inter|rupting
<PB N="16" REF="028389_0592_0FD8ED2F482A1298">the progre&s;s of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to quote it; it is in the&s;e words (b. 3. ch. 4. &s;ect. 63.) "The &s;overeign, declaring war, can neither detain tho&s;e <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of the enemy, who are within his dominions at the time of the declaration, <HI>nor their effects.</HI> They came into his country <HI>on the public faith. By permitting them to enter his territories, and continue there, he incitly promi&s;ed them liberty, and &s;ecurity for their return.</HI>" This pa&s;&s;age contains, explicitly, the principle which is the general ba&s;is of my ar|gument, namely, that the permi&s;&s;ion to a foreigner to come, with his effects into, and acquire others within, our country, in time of peace, virtually pledges the public faith for the &s;e|curity of his per&s;on and property, in the event of war. How can this be reconciled with the <HI>natural</HI> right (controuled only by the cu&s;tomary law of nations) which this writer admits, to confi&s;cate the debts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e by the &s;ubjects of a &s;tate to its ene|mies? I a&s;k once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> can there be a natural right to do what which includes a violation of faith?</P>
<P>It is plain, to a demon&s;tration, that the rule laid down in this pa&s;&s;age, which is to ju&s;t and per&s;picuous as to &s;peak o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|viction to the heart and under&s;tanding, unites the natural with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ary law of nations, in a condemnation of the pre|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter the private property of our enemy, found in our country at the breaking our of a war.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to examine the policy and expediency of &s;uch a preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this inve&s;tigation, I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume, as a ba&s;is of argument, the following po&s;ition, <HI>That it is advantageous to nations to have commerce with each other.</HI></P>
<P>Commerce, it is manife&s;t, like any other object of enter|prize or indu&s;try, will pro&s;per in proportion as it is &s;ecure. Its &s;ecurity, con&s;equently, promoting its pro&s;perity, extends its ad|vantages. Security is indeed e&s;&s;ential to its having a due and regular cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ion of a right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter the ef|fects of foreign merchants, in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, is, in its principle, fatal to that nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity. Its free exerci&s;e would de&s;troy external commerce; or, which is nearly the &s;ame thing, reduce it within the contracted limits of a game of hazard, where the chance of large profits, accompanied with the great ri&s;ks, would tempt alone the adventurous and the de&s;perate. Tho&s;e enterpri&s;es, which, from circuitous or long voyages, &s;lowne&s;s of &s;ales, incident to the nature of cer|tain commodities, the nece&s;&s;ity of credit, or from other cau&s;es, demand con&s;iderable time for their completion, mu&s;t be re|nounced.
<PB N="17" REF="028389_0593_0FD8ED3589C3F830">Credit, indeed, mu&s;t be bani&s;hed from all the ope|rations of foreign commerce; an engine, the importance of which, to its vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful pro&s;ecution, will be doubted by none, who will be guided by experience or ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>It cannot need amplification, to elucidate the truth of the&s;e po&s;itions. The &s;torms of war occur &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o often, us to forbid the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the merchants of one coun|try would tru&s;t their property, to any extent, or for any dura|tion, in another country, which was in the practice of confi&s;|cating or &s;eque&s;tering the effects of its enemies, found within in territories, at the commencement of a war. That practice, therefore, would nece&s;&s;arily paralize and wither the commerce of the country in which it obtained. Accordingly, nations at|tentive to the cultivation of commerce, which Formerly were betrayed, by temporary con&s;iderations, the particular in&s;tances of that atrocious practice, have been led, by the experience of its mi&s;chiefs, to ab&s;tain from it in later times. They &s;aw that to have per&s;i&s;ted in it would have been to abandon com|petition on equal terms, in the lucrative and beneficial field of commerce.</P>
<P>It is no an&s;wer to this, to &s;ay that the exerci&s;e of the right might be ordinarily &s;u&s;pended, though the right it&s;elf wight be maintained, for extraordinary and great emergencies.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as the ordinary for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earence of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would be taken by foreigners for evidence of an intention never to exerci&s;e it, by which they would be enticed into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> depo&s;ites, that would not otherwi&s;e have taken place; a depart|ure from the general cour&s;e would always involve an act of trea|chery and cruelty.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of the occa&s;ional exerci&s;e of &s;uch a right, if conceived to exi&s;t, would be, at lea&s;t, a flow poi&s;on, conducing to a &s;ickly habit of commence; and, in a &s;eries of time, would be productive of much more evil than could be counterbalanced by any good which it might be po&s;&s;i|ble to obtain in the contemplated emergency, by the u&s;e of the expedient.</P>
<P>Let experience decide&mdash;Examples of confi&s;cation and &s;eque&s;|tration have been given&mdash;When did the dread of them prevent a war? when did it cripple an enemy, &s;o as to di&s;able him from exertion, or force him into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the views of his adver&s;ary? When did it even &s;en&s;ibly con&s;pire to either of the&s;e ends? If it has ever had any &s;uch effect, the evidence of it has not come within my knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028389_0594_0FD8ED384B15E018">
It is true, that between Great Britain and the United States, the expectation of &s;uch effects is better warranted than per|haps in any other ca&s;es that have exi&s;ted; becau&s;e we common|ly owe a larger debt to that country, than is u&s;ual between na|tions, and there is a relative &s;tate of things, which tends to a continuation of this &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But how has the matter operated hitherto? In the late war between the two countries, certain &s;tates confi&s;cated the debts due from their citizens to Briti&s;h creditors, and the&s;e creditors actually &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;es. The Briti&s;h cabinet mu&s;t have known, that it was po&s;&s;ible the &s;ame thing might happen in another war, and on a more general &s;cale; yet the appearances were extremely &s;trong, at a particular juncture, that it was their plan, either from ill-will, from the belief that popular opinion would ultir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly drag our government into the war, from the union of the&s;e two, or from other cau&s;es, to force us into ho&s;tilities with them. Hence it appears, that the appre|hen&s;ion of acts of confi&s;cation, or &s;eque&s;tration, was not &s;ufficient to deter from ho&s;tile views, or to in&s;ure pacific di&s;|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>It may be pretended, that the menace of this mea&s;ure, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to re&s;training influence on the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Great Britain. But if was a&s;cribe nothing to the mea&s;ures which our government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">lly pur&s;ued, under the pre&s;&s;ure of the provocations received, we at lea&s;t find, in the cour&s;e of Eu|ropean events, whether &s;olution of a change of policy in the cabinet of Great Britain, than from the dread of a legi&s;lative pi|racy on the debts due to their merchants.</P>
<P>The truth unfortunately is, that the pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;tifle calculation; that nations the mo&s;t attentive to pecuniary con&s;i|derations, ea&s;ily &s;urrender them to ambition, to jealou&s;y, to anger, or to revenge.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the actual experiment of an exerci&s;e of the pretended right, by way of repri&s;al for an injury com|plained of, would commonly be as inefficacious, as the menace of it, to arre&s;t general ho&s;tilities.&mdash;Pride is rou&s;ed; re&s;ent|ment kindled; and where there is even no previous di&s;po&s;ition to tho&s;e ho&s;tilities, the probability is, that they follow. Na|tions, like individuals, ill brook the idea of receding from their preten&s;ions under the rod, or of admitting the ju&s;tice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an act of retaliation or repri&s;al, by &s;ubmitting to it. Thus w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> learn, from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf, that the &s;eque&s;trations of the Sile&s;ia debt, in&s;tead of procuring the re&s;toration for which it was de&s;igned, was on the point of occa&s;ioning an open rupture between him and Great Britain, when the &s;uper|vention
<PB N="19" REF="028389_0595_0FD8ED384D0A3DD8">of a quarrel with France diverted the &s;torm, by render|ing him nece&s;&s;ary as an ally.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be imagined, that the practice of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration would be more efficacious to wound and di&s;|able Great Britain, in ca&s;e of a war, than to prevent it. But this al&s;o is a vain chimera! A nation, that can, at plea&s;ure, rai&s;e by loan twenty millions &s;terling, would be in little dan|ger of being di&s;concerted or enfeebled in her military enter-prizes, by the taking away or arre&s;ting of three or four mil|lions due to her merchants. Did it produce di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;|order among tho&s;e whom it affected and their connexions? If that di&s;order was &s;ufficient to threaten a general derangement of mercantile credit, and, with it, of the public finances, the pending war affords an example, that the public pur&s;e or cre|dit could be brought &s;ucce&s;sfully into action for the &s;upport of the &s;ufferes. Three or four millions of exchequer bills ap|plied in loans, would be likely to &s;uffice, to prevent the partial evil from growing into a national calamity.</P>
<P>But we forget, that as far as the interruption of the pay|ment of the debts due to her merchants could be &s;uppo&s;ed to operate upon Great Britain, war it&s;elf would e&s;&s;entially an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration&mdash;By interrupting trade and intercour&s;e, it is in fact, in a great degree, a virtual &s;eque&s;tration. Remittances to any extent become impractica|ble. There are few ways, in which, on account of the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of war, it is lawful to make them; and debtors are, for the mo&s;t part, enough di&s;po&s;ed to embrace pretexts of procra&s;|tination.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he inconvenience of deferred payment would, therefore, be felt by Great Britain, with little mitigation, from the bare exi&s;tence of war, without the nece&s;&s;ity of our govern|ment incurring the di&s;credit and re&s;pon&s;ibility of a &s;pecial interference.</P>
<P>Indeed, as far as the dread of eventual lo&s;s can operate, it ought, in a great mea&s;ure to have its effect exclu&s;ive of the idea of confi&s;cation. Great Britain mu&s;t want reflection, not to be &s;en&s;ible, that, in making war upon us, &s;he makes war upon her own merchants; by the depredations upon our trade de&s;troying tho&s;e re&s;ources from which they are to be paid. If &s;he be indifferent to this con&s;ideration, it will be becau&s;e &s;he is governed by &s;ome motive or pa&s;&s;ion powerful enough to di&s;po&s;e her to run the ri&s;k of the entire lo&s;s&mdash;in the reliance of obtain|ing indemnification by the acqui&s;itions of war, or in the terms of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028389_0596_0FD8ED39CDAF0570">
Will it be &s;aid, that the &s;eizure of the debts would put in the hands of our government a valuable re&s;ource for carrying on the war? This, upon trial, would prove at fallacious as all the re&s;t. Various inducements would prevent debtors from paying into the trea&s;ury. Some would decline it from con&s;cien|tious &s;cruples, from a doubt of the rectitude of the thing&mdash; others, with intent to make a merit with their creditors of the concealment, and to favor their own future credit and ad|vantage &mdash;others, from a de&s;ire to retain the money in their own employment&mdash;and a great number, from the apprehen&s;ion that the treaty of peace might revive their re&s;pon&s;ibility to the cre|ditors, with the embarra&s;&s;ment to them&s;elves of getting back, as well as they could, the monies which they had paid into the trea&s;ury. Of this, our la&s;t treaty of peace, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinion of able judges, gave an example.&mdash;The&s;e cau&s;es and others, which do not as readily occur, would oppo&s;e great ob&s;tacles to the execution of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But &s;evere laws, inflicting heavy penalties, might compel it&mdash;Experience does not warrant a &s;anguine reliance upon this expedient, in a ca&s;e in which great opportunity of concern|ment is united with &s;trong motives of inclination or intere&s;t&mdash; It would require an inqui&s;ition, ju&s;tly intolerable to a free peo|ple &mdash;penalties, which would confound the due proportion be|tween crime and puni&s;hment, to detect, or to deter from con|cealment and eva&s;ion, and to execute the law&mdash;Probably no means le&s;e efficacious than a <HI>revolutionary tribunial</HI> and a <HI>guillo|tine</HI> would go near to an&s;wer the end.&mdash;There are but few, I tru&s;t, to whom the&s;e would be welcome means.</P>
<P>We may conclude, therefore, that the law would be ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to an extent, which would di&s;appoint the expectations from it, as a re&s;ource. Some monies, no doubt, would be collect|ed, but the probability is, that the amount would be in&s;ignificant, even in the &s;cale of a &s;ingle compaign&mdash;But, &s;hould &s;he collection prove as complete, as it ordinarily is, between debtor and creditor, it would little, if at all, exceed the expen&s;e of one campaign.</P>
<P>Hence we perceive, that, regarding the mea&s;ure, either as a mean of di&s;abling our enemies, or as a re&s;ource to our&s;elves, its con&s;equence dwindles, upon a clo&s;e &s;urvey; it cannot pre|tend to a magnitude, which would apologize, either for a &s;acrifice of national honor or candor, or for a deviation from the true principles of commerce and credit.</P>
<P>But let us take a further view of its di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>A nation, in ca&s;e of war, is under no re&s;pon&s;ibility for the delinquencies or frauds of its citizens, who are debtors to tho&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="028389_0597_0FD8ED410C53C300">of its enemy, if it does not &s;pecially interfere with the pay|ment of the debts which they owe. But, if it interpo&s;es its authority to prevent the payment, it gives a claim of indemni|fication to its adver&s;ary, for the intervening lo&s;&s;es which tho&s;e delinquencies or frauds may occa&s;ion.&mdash;Whether, on the mak|ing of peace, this would be in&s;i&s;ted upon or waved, might depend much on the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of the war; but every thing which adds to the catalogue of our enemy's ju&s;t preten&s;ions, e&s;pe|cially when the fortune of war has been pretty equal, is an evil, either as an additional ob&s;tacle to &s;peedy peace, or as an ingredient to render the terms of it le&s;s advantageous to our|&s;elves. And it is, therefore, unwi&s;e in a government to in|crea&s;e the li&s;t of &s;uch preten&s;ions, by a mea&s;ure, which, with|out utility to it&s;elf, admini&s;ters to the indolence of negligent, and to the avidity of fraudulent, individuals.</P>
<P>Further&mdash;Every &s;pecies of repri&s;al or annoyance, which a power at war employs, contrary to liberality or ju&s;tice, of doubtful propriety, in the e&s;timation of the law of nations, departing from that moderation, which, in latter times, &s;erves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mitigate the &s;everities of war, by furni&s;hing a pretext or provocation to the other &s;ide to re&s;ort to extremities, &s;erves to embitter the &s;pirit of ho&s;tilities, and to extend its ravages. War is then apt to become more &s;anguinary, more wa&s;ting, and every way more de&s;tructive. This is a ground of &s;erious reflection to every nation, both as it regards humanity and policy; to this country it pre&s;ents it&s;elf, accompanied with con&s;iderations of peculiar force. A va&s;tly-extended &s;ea-coa&s;t, over&s;pread with defencele&s;s towns, would offer an abundant p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y to an incen&s;ed and malignant enemy, having the power to command the &s;ea. The u&s;ages of modern war forbid ho&s;ti|lities of this kind; and though they are not always re&s;pected, yet, as they are never violated, unle&s;s by way of retaliation for a violation of them on the other &s;ide, without exciting the re|probation of the impartial part of mankind, &s;ullying the glory; and bla&s;ting the reputation of the party which di&s;regards them, this con&s;ideration has, in general, force &s;ufficient to induce an ob&s;ervance of them. But the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts, or private property in public funds, now gene|rally regarded as an odious and unwarrantable mea&s;ure, would, as between us and Great Britain, contain a poignant &s;ting. Its effect to exa&s;perate, in an extreme degree, both the nation and government of that country, cannot be doubted. A di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, is a natural con&s;equence; and it would not be difficult for us to be made to &s;uffer beyond any po&s;&s;ible degree of advantage to be derived from the occa&s;ion of the retaliation.
<PB N="22" REF="028389_0598_0FD8ED4206D976B8">It were much wi&s;er to leave the property of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, an untouched pledge for the moderation of its government, in the mode of pro&s;ecuting the war.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides (as, if requi&s;ite, might be proved from the records of hi&s;tory) in national controver&s;ies, it is of real importance to conciliate the good opinion of mankind; and it is even u&s;e|ful to pre&s;erve or gain that of our enemy. The latter facili|tates accommodation and peace; the former attracts good of|fices, friendly interventions, &s;ometimes direct &s;upport, from others.&mdash;The exemplary conduct, in general, of our country, in our conte&s;t for independence, was probably not a little &s;er|viceable to us in this way; it &s;ecured, to the intrin&s;ic goodne&s;s of our cau&s;e, every collateral advantage, and gave it a popu|larity among nations, unalloyed and unimpaired, which even &s;tole into the cabinets of princes. A contrary policy tends to contrary con&s;equences. Though nations, in the main, are go|verned by what they &s;uppo&s;e their intere&s;t, he mu&s;t be imper|fectly ver&s;ed in human nature, who thinks it indifferent, whe|ther the maxims of a &s;tate tend to excite kind or unkind di&s;|po&s;itions in others, or who does not know, that the&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tions may in&s;en&s;ibly mould or bias the views of &s;elf-intere&s;t.&mdash; This were to &s;uppo&s;e that rulers only rea&s;on&mdash;do not feel; in other words, are not men.</P>
<P>Moreover, the mea&s;ures of war ought ever to look forward to peace. The confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of the private pro|perty of an enemy mu&s;t always be a point of &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, when intere&s;t or nece&s;&s;ity leads to negociations for peace. Un|le&s;s when ab&s;olutely pro&s;trate by the war, re&s;titution is likely to con&s;titute an ultimatum of the &s;uffering party. It mu&s;t be agreed to, or the war protracted, and at la&s;t, it is probable, it mu&s;t &s;till be agreed to. Should a refu&s;al of re&s;titution prolong the war for only one year, the chance is, that more will be lo&s;t than was gained by the confi&s;cation. Should it be nece&s;&s;ary finally to make it, after prolonging the war, the di&s;advantage will preponderate in a ratio to the prolongation. Should it be, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, a&s;&s;ented to, what will have been gained? The temporary u&s;e of a fund of incon&s;iderable moment, in the general i&s;&s;ue of the war, at the expen&s;e of ju&s;tice, cha|racter, credit, and, perhaps, of having &s;harpened the evils of war. How infinitely preferable to have drawn an equal fund from our own re&s;ources, which, with good management, is always practicable!&mdash;If the re&s;titution includes damages, on account of the interference, for the failures of individuals, the loan will have been the mo&s;t co&s;tly that could have been made. It has been el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, that our treaty of peace with
<PB N="23" REF="028389_0599_0FD8ED45F8A6E248">Great Britain gives an example of re&s;titution. The late one between France and Pru&s;&s;ia gives another. This mu&s;t become every day more and more a matter of cour&s;e, becau&s;e the immunity of mercantile debts becomes every day more and more important to trade, better under&s;tood to be &s;o, and more clearly con&s;idered as enjoined by the principles of the law of nations.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that in reference to the &s;imple que&s;tion of war and peace, the mea&s;ure of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration is mark|ed with every feature of impolicy.</P>
<P>We have before &s;een, that the preten&s;ions of a right to do the one or the other, has a mo&s;t inimical a&s;pect towards commerce and credit.</P>
<P>Let us re&s;ume this view of the &s;ubject. The credit, which our merchants have been able to obtain abroad, e&s;&s;entially in Great Britain, has, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of our country to this day, been the animating principle of our foreign com|merce. This every merchant knows and feels;&mdash;and every in|telligent merchant is &s;en&s;ible, that, for many years to come, the ca&s;e mu&s;t continue the &s;ame. This, in our &s;ituation, is a peculiar rea&s;on, of the utmo&s;t force, for renouncing the pre|ten&s;ion in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of it, or the &s;erious apprehen&s;ion of its exer|ci&s;e, would nece&s;&s;arily have one of two effects.&mdash;It would deprive our merchants of the credit, &s;o important to them, or it would oblige them to pay a premium for it, proportioned to the opi|nion of the ri&s;k. Or, to &s;peak more truly, it would combine the two effects; it would cramp credit, and &s;ubject what was given to a high premium. The mo&s;t obvious and familiar prin|ciples of human action e&s;tabli&s;h, that the con&s;ideration for money or property, lent or credited, is moderate or otherwi&s;e, according to the opinion of &s;ecurity or hazard, and that the quantity of either to be obtained, on loan or credit, is in a great degree contracted or enlarged by the &s;ame rule.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hould we, in the operations of our trade, pay ex|orbitantly for a preten&s;ion, which is of little value, or rather, which is pernicious, even in the relations to which its utility is referred. What folly to cheri&s;h it! How much greater the folly ever to think of exerci&s;ing it! It never can be exer|ci&s;ed hereafter, in our country, without great and la&s;ting mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of cheri&s;hing &s;o odious a preten&s;ion, as "our be&s;t, our only weapon of defence,"&mdash;wi&s;dom admoni&s;hes us to be eager to ca&s;t it from us, as a weapon mo&s;t dangerous to the
<PB N="24" REF="028389_0600_0FD8ED4762F20B80">wearer, pro&s;cribed by the laws of nations, by the laws of ho|nor, and by every principle of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>Every merchant ought to de&s;ire that the mo&s;t perfect tran|quillity, on this point, in foreign countries, &s;hould facilitate to him, on the be&s;t and cheape&s;t terms, the credit for which he has occa&s;ion. And every other citizen ought to de&s;ire, that he may be thus freed from a continual contribution, in the enhanced price of every imported commodity he con&s;umes, to|wards defraying the premium which the want of that tranquil|lity is calculated to generate.</P>

<P>THE analogy of the &s;tipulation in the 10th article, with &s;tipulations in our other treaties, and in the treaties be|tween other nations, is the remaining topic of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Af|ter this, attention will be paid to &s;uch ob&s;ervations, by way of objection to the article, as may not have been before expre&s;sly or virtually an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The 20th article of our treaty of amity and commerce with France, is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"For the better promoting of commerce, on both &s;ides, it is agreed, that if a war &s;hall break out between the &s;aid two nations, &s;ix months, after the proclamation of war, &s;hall be allowed to the merchants in the cities and towns where they live, for &s;elling and tran&s;porting their goods and merchandizes; and if any thing be taken from them, or any injury be done them within that term by either party, or the people or &s;ubjects of either, full &s;atisfaction &s;hall be made for the &s;ame."</P>
<P>The 18th article of our treaty of amity and commerce with the United Netherlands, is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"For the better promoting of commerce, on both &s;ides, it is agreed, that if a war &s;hould break out between their high mightine&s;&s;es, the States General of the United Netherlands, and the United States of America, there &s;hall always be granted to the &s;ubjects on each &s;ide, the term of nine months, after the date of the rupture or the proclamation of war, to the end that they may retire with their effects, and tran&s;port them where they plea&s;e, which it &s;hall be lawful for them to do, as well as to &s;ell and tran&s;port their effects and goods, with all freedom and without any hindrance, and without being able

<P>The 22d article of our treaty of amity and commerce with Sweden, is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"In order to favor commerce, on both &s;ides, as much as po&s;&s;ible, it is agreed, that in ca&s;e war &s;hould break out between the two nations, the term of nine months after the declara|tion of war &s;hall be allowed to the merchants and &s;ubjects re&s;pectively, on one &s;ide and on the other, in order that they may withdraw with their effects and moveables, which they &s;hall be at liberty to carry off or to &s;ell where they plea&s;e, without the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle&mdash;nor &s;hall any &s;eize their effects, and much le&s;s their per&s;ons, during the &s;aid nine months; but on the contrary, pa&s;&s;ports, which &s;hall be valid for a time nece&s;|&s;ary for their return, &s;hall be given them for their ve&s;&s;els and the effects which they &s;hall be willing to carry with them&mdash;and, if any thing is taken from them, or any injury is done to them by one of the parties, their people and &s;ubjects, during the term above pre&s;cribed, full and entire &s;atisfaction &s;hall be made to them on that account."</P>
<P>The 23d article of our treaty of amity and commerce with Pru&s;&s;ia, contains this provi&s;ion:</P>
<P>"If war &s;hould ari&s;e between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country, then re&s;iding in the other, &s;hall be allowed to remain nine months, to collect their debts and &s;ettle their affairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects without mole&s;tation or hindrance."</P>
<P>The&s;e articles of four, and the only commercial treaties we had with foreign powers, prior to the pending treaty with Great Britain, though differing in terms, agree in &s;ub&s;tance; except as to time, which varies from &s;ix to nine months. And they clearly amount to this, that upon the breaking out of a war between the contracting parties in each ca&s;e, there &s;hall be, for a term of &s;ix or nine months, full protection and &s;ecurity to the per&s;ons and property of the &s;ubjects of one, which are then in the territories of the other, with liberty to collect their debts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The term "debts," is only expre&s;&s;ed in the Pru&s;&s;ian treaty, but there are in the other treaties, terms which include debts, and this is the manife&s;t &s;pirit and intent of all.</NOTE> to &s;ell their goods and merchandizes, and to remove,
<PB N="26" REF="028389_0602_0FD8ED4A6673E328">with their effects, where&s;oever they plea&s;e. For this term of &s;ix or nine months, there is a complete &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the pre|tended right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter, giving, or being de&s;ign|ed to give, an opportunity to withdraw the whole property which the &s;ubjects or citizens of one party have in the country of the other.</P>
<P>The differences between the&s;e &s;tipulations and that in the article under examination are chiefly the&s;e: the latter is con|fined to debts, property in the public funds and in public and private banks, without any limitation of the duration of the protection&mdash;The former comprehends, in addition, goods and merchandizes, with a limitation of the protection to a term of &s;ix or nine months; but with the intent and &s;uppo&s;ition that the term allowed may and will be adequate to entire &s;ecurity. The principle, therefore, of all the &s;tipulations is the &s;ame; each aims at putting the per&s;ons and property of the &s;ubjects of one enemy, e&s;pecially merchants, being within the country of the other enemy at the commencement of a war, out of the reach of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who&s;e names are to our other treaties, on the part of the United States, are Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, Arthur Lee, John Adams, and Thomas Jeffer&s;on. The three fir&s;t are to the treaty with France&mdash;Mr. Adams is &s;ingly to that with the United Netherlands&mdash;Dr. Franklin &s;ingly to that with Sweden, and the&s;e two, with Mr. Jeffer&s;on, are jointly to that with Pru&s;&s;ia&mdash;The treaty with Sweden was concluded in April 1783; that with Pru&s;&s;ia, in Augu&s;t, 1785. The&s;e dates repel the idea, that con&s;iderations of policy, relative to the war might have operated in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We have, con&s;equently, the &s;anction of all the&s;e characters to the principle, which governed the &s;tipulation entered into by Mr. Jay, and not only from the ratification of the former treaties at different periods, di&s;tant from each other, by differ|ent de&s;criptions of men in our public councils, but al&s;o from there never having been heard, in the community, a li&s;p of murmur again&s;t the &s;tipulation, through a period of &s;eventeen years, counting from the date of the treaty with France, there is ju&s;t ground to infer a coincidence of the public opinion of the country.</P>
<P>I verily believe, that if, in the year 1783, a treaty had been made with England, containing an article &s;imilar to the 10th in the pre&s;ent treaty, it would have met with general acquie&s;|cence. The &s;pirit of party had not then predi&s;po&s;ed men's minds to e&s;timate the propriety of a mea&s;ure according to the agent, rather than according to its real fitne&s;s and quality.
<PB N="27" REF="028389_0603_0FD8ED4F0E8CD698">What would then have been applauded as wi&s;e, liberal, equita|ble, and expedient, is now, in more in&s;tances than one, under the pe&s;tilential influence of that bale&s;ul &s;pirit, condemned as improvident, impolitic, and dangerous.</P>
<P>Our treaty with Pru&s;&s;ia, the 23d article of which has been cited, is indeed a model of liberality, which, for the principles it contains, does honor to the parties, and has been in this country a &s;ubject of de&s;erved and unqualified admiration. It contradicts, as if &s;tudiou&s;ly, tho&s;e principles of re&s;triction and exclu&s;ion, which are the foundations of the mercantile and na|vigating &s;y&s;tem of Europe. It grants perfect freedom of con|&s;cience and wor&s;hip to the re&s;pective &s;ubjects and citizens, with no other re&s;traint than that they &s;hall not in&s;ult the reli|gion of others. Adopting the rule, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, it extends the protection to the per&s;ons as well as to the goods of enemies.&mdash;Enumerating, as contraband, only "arms, ammunition, and military &s;tores," it even provides that contraband articles &s;hall not be con&s;i&s;cated, but may be taken on the condition of paying for them. It provides again&s;t embar|goes of ve&s;&s;els and effects. It expre&s;sly exempts women, chil|dren, &s;cholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, arti|zan, manufacturers, and fi&s;hermen, unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, and places, and in general, all others who&s;e occupations are for the common &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and benefit of mankind, their hou&s;es, fields, and goods, from mo|le&s;tation in their per&s;ons and employments, and from burning, wa&s;ting, and de&s;truction, in time of war; and &s;tipulates pay|ment at a rea&s;onable price for what may be nece&s;&s;arily taken from them for military u&s;e.&mdash;It likewi&s;e protects from feizure and confi&s;cation, in time of war, ve&s;&s;els employed in trade, and inhibits the granting commi&s;&s;ions to private armed ve&s;&s;els, empowering them to take or de&s;troy &s;uch trading ve&s;&s;els, or to interrupt their commerce; and it makes a variety of excellent provi&s;ions to &s;ecure to pri&s;oners of war, a humane treatment.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars are &s;tated as evidence of the temper of the day, and of a policy, which then prevailed, to bottom our &s;y&s;|tem with regard to foreign nations upon tho&s;e grounds of mo|deration and equity, by which rea&s;on, religion and philo&s;ophy has tempered the har&s;h maxims of more early times. It is pain|ful to ob&s;erve an effort to make the public opinion, in this re|&s;pect, retrograde, and to infect our councils with a &s;pirit con|trary to the&s;e &s;alutary advances towards improvement in true civilization and humanity.</P>
<P>If we pa&s;s from our own treaties, to tho&s;e between other nations, we find that the provi&s;ions, which have been extracted
<PB N="28" REF="028389_0604_0FD8ED505FB8ED08">from ours, have very nearly become formulas in the conven|tions of Europe.

<P>The article with Portugal provides, that if difficulties and doubts &s;hall ari&s;e between the two nations, which give rea&s;on to apprehend the interruption of commerce, public notice of it &s;hall be given to the &s;ubjects on both &s;ides, and afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that no|tice, two years &s;hall be allowed to carry away the merchandize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and goods, and in the mean time, there &s;hall be no injury or prejudice done to any per&s;ons or goods on either &s;ide.</P>

<P>The article with Ru&s;&s;ia, be&s;ides &s;tipulating an exemption from confi&s;cation for one year, with the privilege to remove and carry away in &s;afety, provides additionally, that the &s;ub|jects of each party "&s;hall be further permitted, either at o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before their departure, to con&s;ign the effects which they &s;hall not as yet have di&s;po&s;ed of, as well as the debts that &s;hall be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to them, to &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall think proper, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|di&s;po&s;e of them according to their de&s;ire and for their benefit which debts, the debtors &s;hall be obliged to pay in the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manner as if no &s;uch rupture had happened."</P>

<PB N="29" REF="028389_0605_0FD8ED5426D4DB60">to which it relates, of the foundation of the&s;e &s;tipulations. It is a memorial of Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, mini&s;ter from the court of France to that of London, for negociating peace, dated in the year 1761, and contains the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages: "As it is impracticable for two princes, who make war with <HI>each other, to agree between them which is the aggre&s;&s;or with regard to the other,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus we find it the &s;entiment of this mini&s;ter, that it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for two princes who make war with each other, to agree <HI>which is the coure&s;&s;or with regard to the other.</HI> And yet Mr. Jay was to extort from Great Britain an acknowledg|ment, that <HI>&s;he was the aggre&s;&s;or with regard to us,</HI> and was g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of pu&s;illanimity in waving the que&s;tion.</NOTE> equity and humanity have dictated the&s;e precautions, that where an unfore|&s;een rupture happens &s;uddenly and without any previous decla|ration, foreign ve&s;&s;els, which, navigating <HI>under the &s;ecurity of peace,</HI> and of treaties, happen, at the time of the rupture, to be in either of the re&s;pective ports, &s;hall have time and full liberty to withdraw them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"This wi&s;e provi&s;ion, &s;o agreeable to the rules of good faith, <HI>con&s;titutes a part of the law of nations,</HI> and the article of the treaty, which &s;anctifies the&s;e precautions, ought to be faith|fully executed, notwith&s;tanding the breach of the other articles of the treaty which is the natural con&s;equence of the war.</P>
<P>"The courts of France and Great Britain u&s;ed this &s;alutary precaution in the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle."</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages place the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">urity &s;tipulated in the treaties for the per&s;ons and property <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjects of one party found in the country of another, at the beginning of a war, upon the footing of <HI>its con&s;tituting a part of the law of nations,</HI> which may be con&s;idered as a formal diplomatic recognition of the princi|ple for which we contend. As this po&s;ition was not it&s;elf in di&s;pute between the two governments, but merely a collateral inference from it, applicable to ve&s;&s;els <HI>taken at &s;ea,</HI> prior to a declaration of war, it may be regarded as a re&s;pectable te&s;ti|mony of the law of nations on the principal point.</P>
<P>If the law of nations confers this exemption from &s;eizure upon ve&s;&s;els, which, at the time of the rupture, happen to be in the re&s;pective ports of the belligerent parties, it is evident that it mu&s;t equally extend its protection to debts contracted in a cour&s;e of lawful trade. Ve&s;&s;els are particularly mentioned, becau&s;e the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion turned upon ve&s;&s;els &s;eized at &s;ea. But the reference to the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle &s;hows, that the mini&s;ter, in his ob&s;ervation, had in view the whole &s;ubject matter of the articles of tho&s;e treaties, which provide for the &s;ecurity of merchants and their effects in the event of war.</P>

<P>The an&s;wer to this is, that no right being relinqui&s;hed, on either &s;ide, no privilege granted, the &s;tipulation amounting only to a recognition of a rule of the law of nations, to a pro|mi&s;e to ab&s;tain from inju&s;tice and a breach of faith, there is no room for an argument about reciprocity further than to re|quire that the promi&s;e &s;hould be mutual, as is the ca&s;e&mdash; This is the only equivalent which the nature of the &s;ubject demands or permits&mdash;It would be di&s;honorable to accept a boon merely for an engagement to fulfil a moral obligation&mdash; Indeed, as heretofore intimated, the true rule of reciprocity is &s;tipulations of treaties, is equal right, not equal advantage from each &s;everal &s;tipulation.</P>

I have never under&s;tood, that the private pur&s;e of his Britannic maje&s;ty, if it be true, as a&s;&s;erted, that he has already witne&s;&s;ed a reli&s;h for &s;peculation in our funds (a fact, however, from which it was natural to infer a more pacific di&s;po|&s;ition towards us) was &s;o very ample as conveniently to &s;pare an item of &s;uch &s;ize for a &s;peculation acro&s;s the Atlantic.

<P>If, to avoid this, the plan-&s;hould be to keep the operation unknown, the mo&s;t effectual method would be to place the &s;tock in the names of our own citizens.

<P>Tho&s;e who have con&s;idered with attention the intere&s;ts of commerce, will agree in the opinion, that its utility, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> general pro&s;perity, would be mo&s;t effectually advanced by a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> abolition of the re&s;traints and regulations with which the jea|lou&s;ies and rival policy of nations have embarra&s;&s;ed it.

<P>The rights of commerce among nations between whom exi&s;t no treaties, are imperfect.</P>
<P>"The law of nature," &s;ays Vattel, (b. 1 &s;. 89) "gives to no per&s;on whatever, the lea&s;t kind of right to &s;ell what belongs to him, to another who does not want to buy it; nor has any na|tion that of felling its commodities or merchandize to a people who are unwilling to have them. Every man and every nation being perfectly at liberty to buy a thing that is to be &s;old, or not to buy it, and to buy it of one rather than of another."&mdash; "Every &s;tate has con&s;tantly," continues the &s;ame author, "a right to prohibit the entrance of foreign merchandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and the peo|ple who are intere&s;ted in this prohibition have no right to com|plain of it."&mdash;States by convention may turn the&s;e imperfect into perfect rights, and thus a nation, not having naturally a perfect right to carry on commerce with another, may acquire it by treaty. A &s;imple permi&s;&s;ion to trade with a nation, gives no perfect right to that trade; it may be carried on &s;o long as permitted; but the nation granting &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion is under no obligation to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> perfect right in one nation to carry on commerce and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> with another nation can alone be procured by treaty.</P>
<P>From the precarious nature of trade between nations, as well as from the de&s;ire of obtaining &s;pecial advantages and preferences in carrying it on, originated the earlie&s;t conventi|ons on the &s;ubject of commerce. The fir&s;t commercial treaty that placed the parties on a more &s;ecure and better footing in their dealings with each other than exi&s;ted in their re&s;pective intercour&s;e with other nations, in&s;pired others with a de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h, by &s;imilar treaties, an equally advantageous ar|rangement. Thus one treaty was followed by another, until, as was the ca&s;e when the United States became an independent power, all nations had entered into exten&s;ive and complicated &s;tipulations, concerning their navigation, manufactures and commerce.</P>
<P>This being the actual condition of the commercial world, when we arrived at our &s;tation in it, the like inducements to render certain that, which, by the law of nations, was preca|rious, and to participate in the advantages &s;ecured by national agreements, prompted our government to propo&s;e to all, and to conclude with &s;everal, of the European nations, treaties of comme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e.</P>
<P>Immediately after the conclu&s;ion of the war, congre&s;s ap|pointed Mr. Adams, Doctor Franklin, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on, joint
<PB N="38" REF="028389_0614_0FD8ED7145DD4C08">commi&s;&s;ioners, to propo&s;e and conclude commercial treaties with the different nations of Europe. This commi&s;&s;ion was opened at Paris, and overtures were made to the different powers (including Great Britain) through their mini&s;ters re&s;id|ing at Paris. The ba&s;is of the&s;e numerous treaties, which congre&s;s were de&s;irous to form, was, that the parties &s;hould re&s;pectively enjoy the rights of the mo&s;t favored nations. Va|rious an&s;wers were given by the foreign mini&s;ters, in behalf on their &s;everal nations. But the treaty with Pru&s;&s;ia was the only one concluded, of the very great number propo&s;ed by the Ame|rican commi&s;&s;ioners. Mr. Adams, in 1785, was removed to London, Dr. Franklin &s;oon after returned to America, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;ucceeded him as mini&s;ter at Paris. Thus failed the project of forming commercial treaties with almo&s;t every power in Europe. Treaties with Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, would have been of importance; but the &s;cheme of extending treaties of commerce to all the minor powers of Europe, not omitting his holine&s;s the pope was, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, &s;omewhat chimerical, and could not fail to have ca&s;t an air of ridicule on the commi&s;&s;ions that with great &s;olemnity were ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Paris.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t all remember the various and ill-dige&s;ted laws for the regulation of commerce, which were adopted by the &s;e|veral &s;tates as &s;ub&s;titutes for tho&s;e commercial treatics, in the conclu&s;ion of which our commi&s;&s;ioners had been di&s;appointed &mdash;the embarra&s;&s;ments which proceeded from this &s;ource, join|ed to tho&s;e felt from the derangement of the national trea&s;ury, were the immediate cau&s;e which a&s;&s;embled the convention at Philadelphia in 1787. The re&s;ult of this convention was the adoption of the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titution, the legi&s;lative and executive departments of which each po&s;&s;e&s;s a power to reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|late foreign commerce; the former, by enacting laws for that purpo&s;e, the latter, by forming commercial treaties with Foreign nations.</P>
<P>The opinion heretofore entertained by our government, re|pecting the utility of commercial treaties, is not equivocal;
<PB N="39" REF="028389_0615_0FD8ED72C63C2D18">and it is probable that they will, in future, deem it expedient to adju&s;t their foreign trade by treaty, in preference to legi&s;la|tive provi&s;ions, as far as it &s;hall be found practicable, on terms of rea&s;onable advantage.

Pride and pa&s;&s;ion too frequently add their influence to carry the&s;e regulations beyond the limits of moderation: re&s;traints and exclu&s;ions, on one &s;ide, beget re&s;traints and exclu&s;ions on the other, and the&s;e retaliatory laws lead to, and often terminate in, open war: While, on the other hand, by adju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the commercial inter|cour&s;e of nations by treaty, the preten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns of the parties are candidly examined, and the re&s;ult of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it is fair to pre&s;ume, as well from the experience of individuals in pri|vate affairs, as from that of nations in their more important and complicated relations, e&s;tabli&s;hes tho&s;e regulations which are be&s;t &s;uited to the intere&s;ts of the parties, and which alone afford that &s;tability and confidence &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of commercial enterprize.</P>
<P>That our pre&s;ent gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment have thought a commercial treaty with Great Britain would be advantageous, is evident, not alone from the &s;pecial and di&s;tinct commi&s;&s;ion given to Mr. Jay to form one; but likewi&s;e from the letter of Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, of the 29th November, 1791, which was the fir&s;t letter to that mini&s;ter after his arrival; in which the executive &s;ays: "with re&s;pect to the commerce of the two countries, we have &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;aw, in &s;everal in|&s;tances, regulations on the part of your government, which, if reciprocally adopted, would materially injure the intere&s;ts of <HI>both nations;</HI> on this &s;ubject too, I mu&s;t beg the favor of you to &s;ay, whether you are authorized to conclude or to negociate arrangements with us; which may fix the com|merce between the two countries on principles of recipro|cal advantage."</P>
<P>Further, from the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, to that during which Mr. Jay's appointment took place, efforts were made to di&s;criminate, in our revenue and commercial laws, between tho&s;e nations with whom we had, and tho&s;e with whom we had not, commercial treaties&mdash;The avowed object of which di&s;crimination was, to place the latter nations on a le&s;s advan|tageous commercial footing than the former, in order to induce them likewi&s;e to form commercial treaties with us; and it can|not be forgotten by tho&s;e, who affect to &s;uppo&s;e that it was not expected that a treaty of commerce would be formed by
<PB N="40" REF="028389_0616_0FD8ED7689E8D5B0">Mr. Jay, that Mr. <HI>Madi&s;on's</HI> commercial re&s;olutions, which were under con&s;ideration at the time of Mr. Jay's appointment, grew out of, and were built upon, a clau&s;e of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's report of the 26th December, 1793, which a&s;&s;erts that Great Britain di&s;covered no di&s;po&s;ition to enter into a commercial treaty with us. The report alluded to is explicit in declaring a preference of friendly arrangements, by treaties of commerce, to regulations by the acts of our legi&s;lature, and authorizes the inference, under which the commercial re&s;olutions were brought forward, that the latter &s;hould be re&s;orted to, only when the former cannot be effected.</P>
<P>The power of the executive to form commercial treaties, and the objection again&s;t the commercial articles before us, as an un|con&s;titutional interference with the legi&s;lative powers of con|gre&s;s, will, in the &s;equel, be di&s;tinctly examined, together with other objections on the point of con&s;titutionality.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the policy of regulating commerce by treaty, rather than by acts of the legi&s;lature, it is &s;aid, that the legi&s;lative acts can, but that a treaty cannot, be repealed. This remark is true, and of weight again&s;t the formation of commercial trea|ties which are to be of long duration, or, like our commercial treaty with France, which is per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ment. For, as we are year|ly advancing in agriculture, manufactories, commerce, naviga|tion, and &s;trength, our treaties of commerce, e&s;pecially &s;uch as, by particular &s;tipulations, &s;hall give to the parties other rights than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t favored nation, ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hort duration, that, like temporary laws, they may, at an early day, expire by their own limitation, leaving the intere&s;ts of the parties to a new adju&s;tment, founded on equity and mutual convenience.</P>
<P>Of this de&s;cription are the commercial articles of the treaty with Great Britain; for none of them can continue in force more than twelve years; and they may all expire, if either party &s;hall choo&s;e it, at the end of two years after the peao<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P>Did the limits a&s;&s;igned to this defence admit a review of the commercial and maritime codes of the principal European na|tions, we &s;hould di&s;cover one prevailing feature to characterize them all; we &s;hould &s;ee the general or common intere&s;t of nations, every where, placed in a &s;ubordinate rank, and their &s;eparate advantage adopted, as the end to be attained by their re&s;pective laws&mdash;Hence, one nation has enacted laws to pro|tect their manufactured, another to encourage and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">end their navigation, a third to monopolize &s;ome important branch of trade, and all have contributed to the creation of that compli|cated

<P>One branch, and a principal one of this &s;y&s;tem, that which e&s;tabli&s;hes the connexion between the &s;everal European nations and their colonies, merits our particular attention. An exact knowledge of this connexion would a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the difficulties that &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to our claim of free and full participation in the colony trade of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Unlike the plan of colonization adopted by the ancient go|vernments, who, from the crouded population of their cities, &s;ent forth and e&s;tabli&s;hed beneath their au&s;pices new and inde|pendent republics, the colonies of modern times have been planted with entirely different views; retained in a &s;tate of de|pendence on the parent country, their connexion has been made &s;ub&s;ervient to that &s;pirit of monopoly, which has &s;hown it&s;elf among all the commercial powers. Every European nation has its colonies, and for that rea&s;on prohibited all foreigners from trading to them.</P>

It was not again&s;t this dependence and commercial monopoly that the colonies complained! They were willing to &s;ubmit to them. It was the unju&s;t attempt to tax them, to rai&s;e a reve|nue from them, without their con&s;ent, which combined that firm and &s;pirited oppo&s;ition, which effected a divi&s;ion of the empire&mdash;thus the congre&s;s of 1775, in their la&s;t addre&s;s to the inhabitants of Great Britain, &s;ay, "We chearfully con&s;ent to &s;uch acts of the Briti&s;h parliament as &s;hall be re&s;trained to the regulations of our external commerce, <HI>for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring the commercial advantages of the whole empure to the mother coun|try,</HI> and the commercial benefit of its re&s;pective members! ex|cluding every idea of taxation internal or external for the pur|po&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue on the &s;ubjects in America without their con&s;ent."

<P>So uniform and per&s;evering has been the practice of nations on this point, that in the late&s;t treaties of commerce between France and Spain, between each of the&s;e powers and Great Britain, between Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Portugal, we do not di&s;cover, that any one of the&s;e powers, has con&s;ented to admit the others to a participation in the trade

<P>Monte&s;quieu calls this law appropriating the colony com|merce to the benefit of the parent &s;tate, "A fundamental law of Europe."

Thus it is &s;till a fundamental law of Europe, that all commerce with a foreign colony &s;hall be regarded as a mere monopoly, puni&s;h|able by the laws of the country; and in this ca&s;e we are not to be directed by the laws and precedents of the ancients, which are not at all applicable."</P>
<P>"It is likewi&s;e acknowledged that a commerce e&s;tabli&s;hed between the mother countries, does not include a permi&s;&s;ion to trade in the colonies; for the&s;e always continue in a &s;tate of prohibition." [Monte&s;quieu, Liv. xxi. chap. xvii.]</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is of too gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> importance not to be pur&s;ued a little further.

Some nations, and among them Great Britain, have viewed the exclu&s;ive na|vigation and trade to their colonies, in the light in which they have &s;een their coa&s;ting trade and fi&s;heries; as a nur&s;ery for that body of &s;eamen, whom they have con&s;idered not only as nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perity and protection of commerce, but as e&s;&s;ential to the defence and &s;afety of the &s;tate.</P>

<P>HOWEVER uniform may have been the law of Europe in relation to their colonial e&s;tabli&s;hments, no pains have been &s;pared to create an opinion that France has been guided by a more liberal policy than the other colonizing powers, and that the regulations of her colony trade were e&s;&s;entially di&s;&s;imi|lar from theirs; moreover that her di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was &s;o great, that &s;he not long &s;ince propo&s;ed to our government to e&s;tabli&s;h by treaty, a trade between us and her We&s;t India colonies equally free with that which prevails in her own intercour&s;e with them.

<P>France, like England, has endeavoured to &s;ecure the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible portion of advantage to her&s;elf, by her colonial laws, and the conce&s;&s;ions yielded to foreigners have been only &s;uch deviations from an entire monopoly, as her own intere&s;t has rendered indi&s;pen&s;able&mdash;France, in imitation of the Engli&s;h na|vigation law, as early as 1727, e&s;tabli&s;hed an ordinance, con|firming to the mother country the monopoly of the trade to her colonies, and excluding thereby all foreigners&mdash;Experience proved the nece&s;&s;ity of moderating the rigour of their ordinance, and relaxations in favor of a limited foreign intercour&s;e exi&s;ted at the time when our commercial treaty with France was con|cluded, by the thirtieth article of which, it is agreed, that France will continue to the citizens of the United States, the free ports, which have been and are open in their We&s;t Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i&s;lands, to be enjoyed agreeable to the regulations which relate to them&mdash;A &s;y&s;tem of regulations relative to the trade of fo|reigners with the French i&s;lands, was promulgated in 1784: This ordinance e&s;tabli&s;hed one free port at St. Lucie, another at Martinique, another at Gaudaloupe, another at Tobago, and three others at St. Domingo, to which foreign ve&s;&s;els of the burthen of &s;ixty tons and upwards might carry for &s;ale, woods of all &s;orts, pit coal, live animals, fatted beef, &s;alted fi&s;h, rice, Indian corn, vegetables, green hides, peltry, turpentine, and tar&mdash;This was followed by the arrets of September, 1785, which by impo&s;ing heavy duties on foreign &s;alted fi&s;h, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing large bounties on tho&s;e of the national or French fi&s;h|ery, materially affected the foreign commerce with the French i&s;lands in this important article of &s;upply and con&s;umption.</P>
<P>Such were the duties on the foreign, and the premiums on the national fi&s;h, that together they would have been equivalent to a prohibition of the former, had the national fi&s;hery been able to &s;upply the con&s;umption.</P>
<P>In return for the&s;e articles which alone were permitted to be imported by foreigners into the French i&s;lands, and which it will be ob&s;erved excluded &s;ome of our principal &s;taples e&s;peci|ally

<P>All cotton, coffee, &s;ugar, and other productions (rum and mela&s;&s;es excepted) were prohibited; and we could, except oc|ca&s;ionally by local relaxations of the general law, rightfully obtain none of them from the French We&s;t India i&s;lands&mdash; This was the footing of our trade under our treaty and the &s;tanding edict which preceded the French revolution, and even this was liable to &s;till further limitations, whenever France &s;hould think proper to impo&s;e them; the treaty &s;ecuring only a right to as free a commerce as France &s;hould grant to other foreign nations.</P>
<P>Great Britain has permitted the importation into her We&s;t India colonies of all the foreign articles, allowed by France to be imported into her i&s;lands (&s;alted fi&s;h and &s;alted beef ex|cepted) and &s;he moreover permitted the importation of foreign tobacco, flour, meal, bi&s;cuit, wheat, and various other grains which France prohibited&mdash;In return for the&s;e commodities, Great Britain permitted the exportation from her i&s;lands to our country, of rum and mela&s;&s;es, and moreover of &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, ginger, and pimento, together with &s;uch other articles as are allowed to be carried from their i&s;lands to any other foreign country.</P>
<P>Great Britain prohibited the importation and exportation of mo&s;t of the&s;e articles to and from all foreign nations, except the United States&mdash;France permitted the intercour&s;e with her colo|nies, under the &s;ame limitations to us in common with all other foreign nations.</P>
<P>The articles received from us by Great Britain, for the &s;up|ply of her We&s;t India i&s;lands, exceeded in variety tho&s;e re|ceived from us by France for the &s;upply of her i&s;lands, the Bri|ti&s;h We&s;t Indies were, therefore, in the ordinary and e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e more exten&s;ive cu&s;tomers to us than the French We&s;t Indies. Again, the articles which we received from the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies and which we were prohibited from receiving from the French We&s;t Indies, were among the mo&s;t valuable of their productions, and, from the force of habit, &s;ome of them are included in the catalogue of articles of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in our con&s;umption. In point of &s;upply, therefore, the Briti&s;h were better furni&s;hers, their colonial laws being much le&s;s re&s;trictive than tho&s;e of France.</P>
<P>Though the regulations of the Briti&s;h We&s;t India trade were more favorable to our agriculture than tho&s;e of France, and though the articles with which we were &s;upplied from the Bri|ti&s;h i&s;lands were more numerous and valuable than tho&s;e ob|tained
<PB N="48" REF="028389_0624_0FD8ED8ADF8DE180">from the i&s;lands of France, the colony &s;y&s;tem of the latter was preferable to that of the former in relation to our navigation. France permitted our ve&s;&s;els of and above &s;ixty tons burthen, to carry and bring away the articles, not prohi|bited in the foreign trade with her i&s;lands, while Great Britain confined the trade to her own ve&s;&s;els and excluded tho&s;e of all foreign nations.</P>
<P>Difference of &s;ituation, and not of principle, produced this variety or di&s;tinction in the colony &s;y&s;tem of the two nations. France being able from her re&s;ources to &s;upply mo&s;t of the articles requi&s;ite for the con&s;umption of her We&s;t Indies, and from her great population, having a proportionate demand for the productions of her i&s;lands, &s;he has been carefully re&s;trictive in the trade between her colonies and foreign countries as to the articles of import and export.</P>
<P>All the productions of her i&s;lands, mu&s;t go to the mother country, except rum and mela&s;&s;es; the&s;e articles were not con|fined to France, becau&s;e they would have directly interfered with the valuable manufacture of her brandies. On the other hand, Great Britain, being le&s;s able from her internal re&s;ources to &s;upply the articles nece&s;&s;ary for the con&s;umption of her We&s;t Indies, and her population, or home demand not requir|ing the whole productions of her i&s;lands, &s;he has been more liberal in the trade allowed to be carried on between her colo|nies and foreign countries as to the articles of import and export. But her navigation being adequate to the whole trade of all he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dominions, while that of France required the addition of for|reign bottoms, Great Britain has excluded entirely from her colony trade the foreign ve&s;&s;els of all nations, while France has admitted them to &s;hare in the foreign trade permitted to her We&s;t India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Both France and Great Britain relax their colonial laws, in times of occa&s;ional &s;carcity and when they are engaged in war; during which, the intercour&s;e with their We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is laid more open to foreigners. The catalogue of &s;upplies is &s;ometimes enlarged, and Great Britain, as well as France, during the&s;e relaxations, permits American ve&s;&s;els to re&s;ort to, and engage in the commerce of, their i&s;lands.</P>
<P>It is notwith&s;tanding from the permanent laws alone of the&s;e nations, that we are able to infer their views in relation to their colony trade! the exceptions and deviations that become nece&s;|&s;ary by rea&s;on of accidental &s;carcity or the embarra&s;&s;ments of war, &s;erve only to explain more clearly the principles of the permanent &s;y&s;tem.</P>

The que|&s;tion &s;hall be fairly examined.</P>
<P>There are two letters from Mr. Genet on this &s;ubject&mdash;Imme|diately after his arrival at Philadelphia, in a letter to Mr. Jeffer|&s;on of the 23d May, 1793, he &s;ays&mdash;"The French republic has given it in charge to me to propo&s;e to your government to con|&s;ecrate by a true <HI>family</HI> compact, by a national covenant, the liberal and fraternal ba&s;is, on which it wi&s;hes to e&s;tabli&s;h the commercial and political &s;y&s;tem of two people, who&s;e intere&s;ts are in&s;eparably connected."</P>
<P>If the object of this propo&s;al was a revi&s;ion of our commer|cial treaty, in order to render the intercour&s;e between us more
<PB N="51" REF="028389_0627_0FD8ED93C64D5F70">free and advantageous, this mini&s;ter was &s;ingularly unfortunate in his expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;He might have employed the fine phra&s;e of con&s;ecrating by a true family compact, by a national covenant, the liberal and fraternal ba&s;is on which it was wi&s;hed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the commercial &s;y&s;tem of the two countries, and have been intelligible; but when he tells us, that he is in&s;tructed to open a negociation with our government, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the commercial and political &s;y&s;tem of the two countries, what are we to under&s;tand? That trade and its regulations are alone in view? Or that a family compact e&s;tabli&s;hing the poli|tical, as well as the commercial &s;y&s;tem of the two nations, mu&s;t include likewi&s;e the league or treaty of alliance, whereby the &s;trength and wealth of the two nations &s;hould be clo&s;ely united in the pro&s;ecution of a common object?</P>
<P>This ambiguous overture, if its meaning is not too plain to allow the epithet, was received in the mo&s;t friendly manner by our government, and on the &s;ugge&s;tion that the &s;enate are united with the pre&s;ident in making treaties, it was under&s;tood between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Genet, that the &s;ubject &s;hould be deferred till the meeting of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Before that period, however, Mr. Genet, in a letter of the 30th of September, 1793, renews the propo&s;al to open the ne|gociation relative to the propo&s;ed family compact between us and France; and proves to us that our benefit was its principal exclu&s;ive object, by affectionately intimating in the conclu&s;ion of his letter, that he is further in&s;tructed to tell us, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al or eva&s;ion on our part to enter into this family agree|ment, that France will repeal the laws dictated by the attach|ment of the French for the Americans.</P>
<P>Had it before been doubted whether political engagements relative to war, were intended to be connected with the pro|po&s;ed treaty, the&s;e doubts mu&s;t have di&s;appeared on the receipt of this &s;econd letter from Mr. Genet; the intimation that the laws of France which operated favorably to our trade with their dominions, would be repealed, in ca&s;e we refu&s;ed or evaded the conclu&s;ion of a new treaty, cannot be reconciled, with the belief, that this treaty was &s;ought for from motives purely commercial, or &s;olely to enlarge and add pro&s;perity to our trade.</P>
<P>Mr. Genet at this time had &s;o outraged our government as to have compelled them to reque&s;t his recall, he mu&s;t, there|fore, have been convinced, that no con&s;cience would be held with him except on points of urgent importance, and &s;uch as would not admit of delay&mdash;He was, therefore, an&s;wered by Mr. Jeffer&s;on on the 5th of November, that his letter had been

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the internal evidence contained in the two letters of Mr. Genet was &s;ufficient to have &s;atisfied a &s;en&s;ible people, that &s;omething beyond a commercial treaty was con|nected with the proffered negociation, and though this con|jecture acquired &s;trength from the cautious procedure of our government on the occa&s;ion: yet the&s;e letters, and that proce|dure, have been pre&s;&s;ed upon the public as conclu&s;ive evidence, that France had offered, and our government refu&s;ed, to enter into a new treaty of commerce, that would have been highly beneficial to our trade and navigation.</P>

<P>By the&s;e in&s;tructions it appears, that the e&s;&s;ential object of this proffered negociation, was to engage the United States to make common cau&s;e with France in the war then fore&s;een, and which &s;oon broke out with Spain and England&mdash;That the advan|tages to be yielded by a new commercial treaty were to be pur|cha&s;ed by our uniting with France in <HI>extending the empire of liberty, in breaking up the colonial and monopolizing-&s;y&s;tems of all nations, and finally in the emancipation of the new world</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This mad &s;cheme, the joining in which was to be the price of the proffered advantages, has &s;ince been renounced by France her&s;elf; as a political chimera.</NOTE>&mdash;This was laying out a large and difficult work, in the accompli&s;hment whereof arduous and numerous perils mu&s;t be met, to en|counter which we were called by no obligation to others, to avoid which we were admoni&s;hed by all the duties which re|quire

<P>However contradictory this extraordinary project may appear to the friendly communications that had been made by the French government to ours, however repugnant to the &s;oothing declarations pronounced by Mr. Genet, of the fraternal and generous &s;entiments of his country towards ours, and of the republican frankne&s;s and &s;incerity that &s;hould characteri&s;e his deportment;&mdash;let the following extracts from his in&s;tructions publi&s;hed by him&s;elf in December, 1793, be con&s;ulted in con|firmation of this &s;tatement, and as an authentic expo&s;ition of the genuine views of the French executive council in the mi&s;|&s;ion of Mr. Genet&mdash;viz.</P>

<P>The &s;enate have, however, and, I think, wi&s;ely, con&s;idered the terms and conditions, on which it is agreed by the 12th article, that we &s;hould participate in the trade of the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies, as le&s;s liberal than we may, with rea&s;on, expect&mdash; The exclu&s;ion of all ve&s;&s;els above the burden of &s;eventy tons, would dimini&s;h the benefits and value of this trade; and though we cannot calculate upon obtaining by future negocia|tion a total removal of a limitation on this &s;ubject, it is not altogether improbable that a tonnage &s;omething larger may be procured.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with our pre&s;ent intercour&s;e with the We&s;t Indies can be&s;t determine whether many ve&s;&s;els under &s;eventy tons burden are not, at this time, profitably employed in that trade: it is believed to be true, that previous to our independence, ve&s;&s;els of this burden were much engaged in that employ as well in the &s;outhern as in the ea&s;tern &s;tates.</P>
<P>This limitation, though di&s;advantageous, is not the &s;tronge&s;t objection to the 12th article: the re&s;training or regulating of a portion of our trade, which does not proceed from, and is inde|pendent of the treaty, forms a more deci&s;ive rea&s;on again&s;t the article than any thing el&s;e that it contains.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this re&s;traint is found in the commercial jea|lou&s;y and &s;pirit of monopoly, which have &s;o long reigned over the trade of the colonies&mdash;Under our treaty with France and the French colonial laws, it has been &s;hown that we could not procure from the French i&s;lands &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, or any of the other productions, mela&s;&s;es and rum excepted.&mdash; Great Britain has &s;een it to be compatible with her intere&s;t to admit us to &s;hare more exten&s;ively in the productions of her i&s;lands; but &s;he has de&s;ired to place limitations on this inter|cour&s;e. To have left it entirely open and free, would have been to have enable us not only to &s;upply our&s;elves by means of our own navigation, but to have made it an in&s;trument of the &s;up|ply of other nations with her We&s;t India productions.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims of the colony &s;y&s;tem, and moreover when we con&s;ider, that an entire freedom of trade with the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies might, at times, mate|rially rai&s;e the price of We&s;t India productions on the Briti&s;h con&s;umers, the &s;upply of whom is e&s;&s;entially a monopoly in the hands of the Briti&s;h planters, we &s;hall be the le&s;s inclined to be|lieve that Great Britain will yield an unre&s;trained commerce with her We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to any nation whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="028389_0634_0FD8EDA2C5BBC218">
But if this was the object of the re&s;traint, it may be a&s;ked why it was not confined to &s;uch enumerated articles as were o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the growth or production of her own i&s;lands, in&s;tead of being &s;o extended as to comprehend all mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton, including even the cotton of the growth of our own country? It is very po&s;&s;ible that the circum&s;tances of our native cotton's becoming an article of export to foreign markets might not have occurred to our negociator&mdash;This would be the le&s;s extraordinary, as heretofore it has not been cultivated, ex|cept in a very limited degree, and as an article of export rather in the manner of experiment than otherwi&s;e; and, as moreover, from the expen&s;e and difficulty of &s;eparating the &s;eeds from the cotton, we have been hardly able hitherto to cla&s;s cotton among our exports. Its cultivation is &s;aid latterly to have become an object of attention, in Georgia and South Carolina&mdash;&s;till how|ever it cannot yet be con&s;idered as a &s;taple commodity&mdash;But from the recent ingenious and &s;imple machine for &s;pinning cot|ton, it is hoped that the cultivation may be extended, &s;o that not only our own dome&s;tic manufactures may be relieved from a dependence on foreign &s;upply, but the catalogue of our valu|able exports enriched by the addition of this ine&s;timable pro|duction.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion that has been &s;tated: it may be further ob&s;erved, that the&s;e enumerated articles, though the productions of different territories, being &s;o much alike as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, it is probable that the difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;criminating the productions of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands from tho&s;e of a different growth, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o great, that an ap|prehen&s;ion was entertained that the prohibition to re-export the former would be ea&s;ily evaded and illu&s;ory, while the latter remained free.</P>
<P>This apprehen&s;ion, however, it is believed, was carried too far; as, on a minute examination of the &s;ubject it will be found, that our laws relative to drawback, with a few analogous pro|vi&s;ions in addition, can be made &s;ufficiently to di&s;criminate and identify on re-exportation, all &s;uch articles of the growth of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, as may be within our country, and that they will afford the &s;ame &s;ecurity for a faithful and exact execution of the prohibition to re-export &s;uch articles as that on which our own government relies again&s;t frauds upon the revenue.

But though the conduct of the &s;enate in withholding their a&s;&s;ent to this article, is conceived, upon the whole, to be well judged and wi&s;e, yet there were not wanting rea&s;ons of real weight to induce our negociator to agree to it as it &s;tands.</P>
<P>The inviolability of the principles of the navigation act had become a kind of axiom, incorporated in the habits of thinking of the Briti&s;h government and nation. Precedent, it is known, has great influence, as well upon the councils as upon the popular opinions of nations!&mdash;and there is, perhaps, no country in which it has greater force than that of Great Britain&mdash;The precedent of a &s;erious and unequivocal innovation upon the &s;y&s;tem of the navigation act, di&s;&s;olved as it were the &s;pell by which the public prejudices had been chained to it. It took away a mighty argu|ment derived from the pa&s;t inflexibility of the &s;y&s;tem, and laid the foundation for greater inroads upon opinion, for further and greater innovations in practice. It &s;erved to &s;trip the que&s;tion of every thing that was artificial and to bring it to the &s;imple te&s;t of real national intere&s;t, to be decided by that be&s;t of all arbiters, experience.</P>
<P>It may, upon this ground, be &s;trongly argued that the pre|cedent of the privilege gained was of more importance than its immediate extent&mdash;an argument certainly of real weight, and which is &s;ufficient to incline candid men to view the mo|tives that governed our negociator in this particular, with favor, and the opinion to which he yielded with re&s;pect. It is perhaps not unimportant by way of precedent, that the article, though not e&s;tabli&s;hed, is found in the treaty.</P>
<P>Though the 12th article, &s;o far as re&s;pects the terms and con|ditions of the trade to the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, forms no part of the treaty, having been excepted, and made the &s;ubject of fur|ther negociation, it may neverthele&s;s be u&s;eful to take notice of &s;ome of the many ill-founded objections that have been made again&s;t it: of this character, is that which a&s;&s;erts, that the ca|talogue of articles, permitted to be carried by us to the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, may be abridged at the plea&s;ure of Great Britain, and &s;o the trade may be annihilated.</P>
<P>The article &s;tipulates that we may carry to any of his maje&s;|ty's i&s;lands and ports in the We&s;t Indies, from the United States, in American ve&s;&s;els, not exceeding &s;eventy tons, any goods or merchandizes "being of the growth, manufacture or production of the &s;aid &s;tates, <HI>which it is or may be</HI> lawful to carry to the &s;aid i&s;lands, from the &s;aid &s;tates, in Briti&s;h ve&s;|&s;els;" not all &s;uch articles as it is and may be lawful to carry, but in the disjunctive, all &s;uch as it is or may be lawful to carry; in other words, all &s;uch articles as it is now lawful to carry,

<P>This article has been further critici&s;ed on account of the adju&s;tment of the import and tonnage duties payable in this trade, and it has been attempted to be &s;hown that the footing on which we were to &s;hare in the &s;ame would, on this account, be di&s;advantageous, and the competition unequal. What is the adju&s;tment? The article propo&s;es that Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els emplo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in this trade &s;hall pay, on entering our ports, the alien ton|nage duty payable by all foreign ve&s;&s;els, which is now fifty cents per ton; further, the cargoes imported in Briti&s;h bottoms from the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies, &s;hall pay in our ports the &s;ame impo&s;t or duties, that &s;hall be payable on the like articles im|ported in American bottoms; and on the other &s;ide, that car|goes imported into the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, in American bottoms &s;hall pay the &s;ame impo&s;t or duties that &s;hall be payable on the like articles imported in Briti&s;h bottoms&mdash;that is to &s;ay, the cargoes of each &s;hall pay in the ports of the other only native duties, it being under&s;tood that tho&s;e impo&s;ed in the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies, on our productions, are &s;mall and unimportant, while tho&s;e impo&s;ed in our ports, on the productions of the We&s;t Indies, are high, and important to our revenue.&mdash;The ve&s;&s;els of each &s;hall pay in the ports of the other an equal alien tonnage duty, and our &s;tandard is adopted as the common ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>Is not this equal? can we expect or a&s;k Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els &s;hould pay an alien tonnage duty in our ports, and that American ve&s;|&s;els &s;hould enter their ports freely, or on payment only of na|tive tonnage duties? can we in equity require them to pay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the importation of their cargoes in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, an addition of ten per cent. on the duties payable on the importation of the like articles in American ve&s;&s;els, and at the &s;ame time de|mand to pay no higher or other duties on the cargoes carried in our ve&s;&s;els to the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, than tho&s;e payable by the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the like articles imported in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els? the very &s;lating of the que&s;tion &s;ugge&s;ts to a candid mind an an&s;wer, that de|mon&s;trates the inju&s;tice of the objection.

<P>But it is added, that our laws impo&s;e a tonnage duty of &s;ix cents per ton on the entry of American ve&s;&s;els engaged in fo|reign trade, and it is not known that Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els pay any tonnage duty on their entry in their ports in the We&s;t Indies&mdash; and &s;o uniting the two entries, that is, the entry in the We&s;t Indies, and the entry on a return to our ports, an American ve&s;&s;el will pay fifty-&s;ix cents per ton, when the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els will pay only fifty cents per ton&mdash;If the Briti&s;h govern|ment impo&s;e no tonnage duty on their own ve&s;&s;els, and we do impo&s;e a tonnage duty on ours, this certainly cannot form an objection again&s;t them. They are as free to refrain from the impo&s;ition of a tonnage duty on their own &s;hips, as we are to impo&s;e one on ours&mdash;If their policy is wi&s;er than ours in this re&s;pect, we are at liberty to adopt it, by repealing the tonnage duty levied on American navigation, which, if we plea&s;e, may be confined to the particular ca&s;e; the effect of &s;uch a mea&s;ure as far as it &s;hould extend, though the duty is &s;mall, would be to add a proportionable advantage to our &s;hipping in foreign com|petition. But the object of the articles in this particular is to equalize, not the duties that each may choo&s;e to impo&s;e on their own ve&s;&s;els, but tho&s;e that they &s;hall impo&s;e on the ve&s;&s;els of each other: and in this re&s;pect the article is perfectly equal&mdash; It is perhaps the fir&s;t time that the objection of inequality was founded on a circum&s;tance depending on the laws of the party affected by it, and removeable at his own option.</P>
<P>This view of the &s;ubject authorizes a belief, that, in the revi&s;ion of the article, a modification of it may be agreed to that will prove &s;atisfactory. Indeed, from the &s;hort duration of the article, taken in connexion with the expre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of towards the clo&s;e of it, relative to the renewal of the ne|gociation, for the purpo&s;e of &s;uch further arrangements as &s;hall conduce to the mutual advantage and <HI>exten&s;ion</HI> of this branch of commerce, we may infer that Great Britain contemplates a more enlarged and equal adju&s;tment on this point.</P>
<P>The relaxations which now exi&s;t in the colonial &s;y&s;tems, in con&s;equence of the nece&s;&s;ities of war, and which will change to our di&s;advantage with the return of peace, have been con&s;i|dered by &s;ome as the permanent &s;tate of things.

<P>THE 9th article &s;tipulates that &s;uch Briti&s;h &s;ubjects as now hold lands in the territory of the United States, &s;hall continue to hold them according to the <HI>tenure and nature of their</HI> re&s;pective e&s;tates, and may &s;ell, grant or devi&s;e them as if they were natives, and renders this &s;tipulation mutual. Though this article may not be exten&s;ively dangerous, yet it merits our attention, as it appears to infringe the con&s;titutional independence of the re&s;pective &s;tates&mdash;Congre&s;s alone have the power to naturalize; but neither congre&s;s, nor any member of the federal government, appear to me to have any right to de|clare the tenure by which lands &s;hall be holden in the territories of the individual &s;tates, without naturalization. This is an act of &s;overeignty which is confined to the &s;tate legi&s;latures, and which they have not ceded to congre&s;s, about which, there|fore, I am led to doubt the right of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to treat.&mdash;"Powers not delegated to the United States, being ex|pre&s;sly re&s;erved to the States or the people thereof."&mdash;Is this right of the &s;tates abridged by the power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to make treaties? Are not their powers to treat confined to &s;uch objects as the con&s;titution entru&s;ts to the federal go|vernment?

If I am rightly informed, it greatly exceeds all the land retained by the &s;tate. In New York, the lands commonly called Morris's, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Comb's, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Scriba's purcha&s;es, equal in quantity all the remaining lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tate.

<PB N="65" REF="028389_0641_0FD8EDB408B17E90">for &s;ale of the&s;e lands. If is was effected before the ratifica|tion, or at lea&s;t before the &s;ignature of the treaty, as much land may be held in this &s;tate by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects as by Ameri|can citizens. If they were held in tru&s;t, which is highly pro|bable, the per&s;on in who&s;e favor the tru&s;t was created, is now &s;ecured from forfeiture, &s;ince they are to hold "according to the <HI>nature and tenure of their re&s;pective e&s;tates and titles," &amp;c.</HI> The Briti&s;h con&s;truction of this article will give them the full be|nefit of their purcha&s;es; it may then happen, even under the pre&s;ent treaty, as it now &s;tands, that the greater part of the lands of the two &s;tates, at lea&s;t, belong to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who may look to their own &s;overeign for protection, even again&s;t the &s;tate who&s;e lands they hold. What dangers and difficulties may not this expo&s;e the &s;tates to? If it is admitted that the pre|&s;ident and &s;enate can by treaty &s;tipulate without the con&s;ent of a &s;tate, that their lands may be held by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, what principle is there in the con&s;titution which prevents their making the &s;ame &s;tipulation in favor of the Briti&s;h king, or their transferring all the vacant lands in every &s;tate to him? The&s;e were formerly inve&s;ted in him, and I doubt not that if he were to &s;et up a claim under this article, that he would find advocates among us to &s;upport it. Let it be remembered that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate is only derived from an <HI>implication</HI> founded on their right to make treaties. I would a&s;k, whether a &s;tronger implication in favor of an exclu&s;ive right in the &s;tate governments to make regula|tions relative to this object, is not found in the third &s;ection, fourth article of the con&s;titution&mdash;"<HI>Congre&s;s</HI> &s;hall have the power to di&s;po&s;e of and make all needful rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territory, or other property of the United States; and nothing in this con&s;titution &s;hall be &s;o con&s;trued as to pre|judice <HI>any claims</HI> of the United States, or of <HI>any particular &s;tates.</HI>" The claim of &s;tates to declare the tenure on which their lands &s;hall be held, has never been di&s;puted; and &s;o jea|lous have &s;ome of them been of it, that they have repeatedly refu&s;ed to admit foreigners to hold lands without naturalization.</P>
<P>Several articles, which appear to me exceptionable, remain to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but, circum&s;tances, ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation of the city, compel me to lay a&s;ide my pen. When the&s;e circum&s;tances cea&s;e to operate, I may again re&s;ume it. I tru&s;t, however, that enough has been &s;aid to &s;how, that the treaty has obtained no adequate compen&s;ation for the inju|ries we have &s;uffered. That it has relinqui&s;hed important claims that we had upon the Briti&s;h government. That it has given no protection to our &s;eamen. That it is injurious to our commerce,
<PB N="66" REF="028389_0642_0FD8EDB649BC5328">and ruinous to our navigation. That it takes from us the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of retaliating injuries without the hazard of a wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. That it pledges the country for immen&s;e &s;ums of money, which it does not owe, while it curtails our demands upon Britain. That it gives the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects a variety of privileges in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> country, which are but partially returned to us. That it coun|teracts the exi&s;ting laws, and violates the federal con&s;titution, and that it infringes the rights of individual &s;tates. It is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ble, that in &s;tating my idea of the treaty, I may have run into errors; all I can &s;ay, is, that if I have, none of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intentional; that having no party to &s;erve, no per&s;onal intere&s;t to promote, I have only &s;poken &s;entiments, which an ard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> love for a country, which I have long &s;erved, has in&s;pired, without wi&s;hing to mi&s;lead.

<P>The expre&s;s words of the treaty are our only true guide.

<P>THE hero of the funding and exci&s;e &s;y&s;tems, the parent of that immaculate axiom, which would do honor to Con|&s;tantinople, that <HI>a public debt is a public ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> has entered the li&s;ts as the champion of his darling brat, The Treaty.

Would the part which we &s;hould take in the league of de&s;pots, &s;hould the treaty ob|tain, &s;often the horrors or mitigate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war? Would a war with the French republic prop <HI>a funding &s;y&s;tem,</HI> that he &s;eems &s;o carele&s;s about it? Should his ba&s;tard be legi|timized, there can be little doubt, that France would con&s;ider it as an infraction of our neutrality, as a &s;uperce&s;&s;ion of our engagements with her, and as a virtual, though not formal, acce&s;&s;ion to the confederacy of tyrants again&s;t her. Circum|&s;tances, my fellow citizens, will ju&s;tify the &s;u&s;picion, that a war with the French republic would be con&s;idered as a thing devoutly to be wi&s;hed by Camillus and his friends, and that the treaty was formed with a &s;olicitude for that event. There &s;eems to have been a deliberate plan to exterminate liberty, and this was to have been effected by throwing off the connex|ion with France, and con&s;olidating our&s;elves with Great Bri|tain.&mdash;In the arms of de&s;poti&s;m, liberty would have been &s;uf|focated; and in the arms of a Briti&s;h tyrant her fate would have been inevitable.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of affection for France, in the brea&s;ts of the American citizens, <HI>&s;ince &s;he became a republic,</HI> &s;eems to have produced a &s;erious alarm among the <HI>Ari&s;tocratic faction</HI> of the United States; and hence the repugnance to treat with her
<PB N="70" REF="028389_0646_0FD8EDBE84DF5850">anew&mdash;hence the Machiavelian con&s;truction of every thing which was due to her&mdash;and hence the &s;olicitude to form the unnatural alliance that has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the treaty. That the government of the United States has been making rapid|&s;trides towards ari&s;tocracy, no unprejudiced man, at this time of day, will deny; and that a connexion with Great Britain was &s;ought for, to facilitate this object, no one, who has no|ticed the &s;teps of our admini&s;tration, and has read the treaty, unbia&s;&s;ed by party &s;pirit, will controvert. If there was not an <HI>extraordinary</HI> predilection for Great Britain, would the United States have been pa&s;&s;ive under the many outrages they have &s;u&s;tained&mdash;would they have &s;uffered, in &s;ilence, their &s;eamen to be impre&s;&s;ed, like &s;laves, on board Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, and would they have beheld the unparalleled in&s;ult, without emo|tion, that has been offered to our nation, in the attempt to &s;eize a mini&s;ter of France, within the limits of our own terri|tory!! Heaven, earth, and hell, would have been conjured, if an attempt of the &s;ort had been made upon the mini&s;ter of Great Britain: and yet tho&s;e fiends are by treaty <Q>to be treat|ed with that re&s;pect which is due to the commi&s;&s;ions which they bear; and if any in&s;ult &s;hould be offered to them, be any of the inhabitants, all offenders, in this re&s;pect, &s;hall be puni&s;hed as di&s;turbers of the peace and amity between the two countries</Q>!!</P>
<P>Fellow citizens, I have digre&s;&s;ed from the treaty; but you will think it excu&s;able, as you know the cau&s;e; for the man who can behold the bare-faced attempts upon our rights, and the audacious outrages upon our country, without the &s;tronge&s;t emotions, is unworthy of the freedom and inheritance of the revolution.</P>

<P>A SOLEMN, an awful &s;ilence pervades the world of American politics, portentive of &s;ome great event. The &s;ignature, the unexpected &s;ignature of the pre&s;ident to the treaty, has momentarily paralized the American mind, as if by etherial impul&s;e; and it has not yet recovered from the incubus of a&s;toni&s;hment and grief, with which it was oppre&s;&s;ed. The omnipotence of truth will, however, at la&s;t prevail; and though the Americans are grateful, they are ju&s;t; and that
<PB N="71" REF="028389_0647_0FD8EDC377283570">&s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice will prevent a barter of their own rights and their own happine&s;s for the gratification of any individual, how|ever high his <HI>own</HI> claim to an unlimited contrul over his coun|try. The conflict of jarring feelings, the &s;trife between grati|tude and &s;elf-love, has, for a moment, &s;u&s;pended the voice of injured freemen; but the feeble mound of gratitude will not long re&s;i&s;t the impetuous and imperious cataract of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation.&mdash;Gratitude! What means it when in contact with poli|tical ju&s;tice! What means it, when thrown in the oppo&s;ite balance of our happine&s;s! Does an individual claim more feel|ing than our&s;elves, our families, our country! Does he demand &s;entiments in ho&s;tility to our own repo&s;e! Human nature mu&s;t undergo a revolution before this can come to pa&s;s, and virtue yield its throne to vice.</P>
<P>The &s;ervices of the pre&s;ident, during the revolution, are decked in all their charms, to &s;educe us from a que&s;tion of his pre&s;ent motives. He is held up to us as the high prie&s;t of liberty, to give ab&s;olution to our own &s;en&s;ations. The amiable virtue, gratitude, is appealed to in our bo&s;oms, to neutralize our indig|nation, at his having &s;igned the treaty, <HI>after the general &s;enti|ments of his country had been made known to him, in oppo&s;ition to it.</HI> Had his &s;ignature been given immediately after the adjourn|ment of the &s;enate, and before an univer&s;al expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;|approbation of it had taken place, ingenuity might have found a cover for him; but the public mind &s;eems to have been de&s;ignedly wrought up to the highe&s;t key of expectation, that the contempt of it might be more &s;trongly di&s;clo&s;ed. Is grati|tude to put a &s;eal upon our lips under &s;uch circum&s;tances? Are freemen to be treated with the mo&s;t marked contumely, and to be pa&s;&s;ive under it like &s;laves? Is the pre&s;ident to receive more reverence than our con&s;titution, and more devotion than liber|ty! Let us be con&s;i&s;tent, and either renounce our con&s;titution, and our preten&s;ions to freedom, or rally round them in con|tradiction to the will of an individual. I will endeavour to prove to you, my fellow citizens, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e letters, that our con&s;titution has been totally di&s;regarded, and that the pre&s;ident has &s;ub&s;tituted his will, for the will of the people&mdash; that he has thwarted the affections of the people, and in con|tempt of their attachment to the republic of France, and aver|&s;ion from Great Britain, has deceived the one, and crouched to the other. If gratitude is due to the pre&s;ident, has not France like|wi&s;e a claim to it? Shall <HI>he</HI> prove ungrateful to her, and <HI>we</HI> prove grateful to him? Shall he practice deception upon the be&s;t friend of our country, a friend to who&s;e generous aid he owes his pre&s;ent greatne&s;s,&mdash;and &s;hall we prove perfidious
<PB N="72" REF="028389_0648_0FD8EDC48BAD9BD8">enough to give it our countenance? Shall he take Great Bri|tain into his bo&s;om, Great Britain who &s;ought to en&s;lave us, who has been guilty of every ba&s;ene&s;s and every outrage again&s;t us, and &s;hall we be obliged to &s;mile upon the mon&s;ter, and receive the ki&s;s of Judas? Shall he greet the tyrant George, as his <HI>"great, good, and dear friend;"</HI> and &s;hall we be obliged to recognize &s;uch &s;acrilege of liberty? Shall he colonize us anew, and &s;hall we be obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe the &s;hameful compact? Shall that independence, which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to e&s;tabli&s;h, be pro|&s;trated by him at the feet of Great Britain&mdash;&s;hall that con&s;titu|tion, the &s;acred bond of union and dear bought inheritance of the revolution, be trampled under foot by him, and gratitude &s;till be chaunted in our ears? Was the revolution de&s;igned to make him a monarch, and a few &s;peculators noblemen! Is this the gratitude that is demanded? Are we to e&s;tabli&s;h a political infallibility, and con&s;ecrate a political pope in our country? Is it longer to continue impious to arraign pre&s;idential mea&s;ures?

<P>Fellow citizens, we are on the eve of &s;ome great event&mdash;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> liberties are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> jeopardy, and we mu&s;t either re&s;cue them from the precipice, or they will be lo&s;t to us for ever.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Citizen Greenleaf,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO expatiate on the ju&s;tice, power, and re&s;ources of Great-Britain&mdash;to ju&s;tify all her acts, however wanton and unju&s;t&mdash;to depreciate his own country, and to place her in the wrong upon every occa&s;ion, are favourite themes with CAMILLUS. Hence it was no matter of &s;urprize to find him in his third number, attempting a formal vindication of Great-Britain for carrying away the negroes, and ridiculing our claim, on that &s;ubject. As this is the fir&s;t number that contains any thing like argument, it ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed. By the treaty of Paris, his Britannic maje&s;ty agreed "not to carry away any negroes from the United States." This, &s;ays Ca|millus, mu&s;t mean either negroes which <HI>had been,</HI> or which at the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities <HI>continued to be</HI> American proper|ty. When the meaning of an in&s;trument is doubtful, there cannot be a &s;afer or fairer way to obtain its true &s;en&s;e, than by con&s;idering its circum&s;tances, and the views of the parties at the time of making the contract, and that they acted with good faith to each other. To apply this rule; during the late war, many negroes had been taken by, or had voluntarily joined the armies or gone into the garri&s;ons of Great-Britain. To reclaim them, and prevent their being carried away, was an object which our commi&s;&s;ioners had much at heart; and it is not ea&s;y to conceive how this object could have been ex|pre&s;&s;ed in plainer or le&s;s ambiguous terms. It will be remem|bered, that Franklin had an agency in that treaty; and per|haps no man ever excelled him in per&s;picuity and pertinency of expre&s;&s;ion; that tho&s;e negroes and tho&s;e alone were in the contemplation of both parties, re&s;ults from the very nature of the ca&s;e. It could not be nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t new de|predations of this kind&mdash;peace being made, all ho&s;tilities of every kind cea&s;ed. As well might a clau&s;e have been in&s;erted, to prohibit &s;hips of war, of the different parties, from making
<PB N="76" REF="028389_0652_0FD8EDCF07BEA2B0">prizes during the peace; as the captains of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els would have been treated like pirates, &s;o might every negro, or his va|lue, been recovered by a regular cour&s;e of law, from any per|&s;on who had taken him after the peace, without any &s;tipula|tion in the treaty for that purpo&s;e. To confine this article, therefore, to an engagement to ab&s;tain from further plunder, is rendering it altogether negative and u&s;ele&s;s; which is never to be &s;uppo&s;ed, and cannot be pre&s;umed to have been the inten|tion of either party. The rea&s;oning of Camillus is con&s;train|ed and contradictory; in one breath, he likens the negroes to "hor&s;es, cattle, and other moveables, and as &s;uch liable to become booty;" in the next con&s;idering them "as rational beings, and as entitled to liberty under Briti&s;h proclamations, he concludes it would have been <HI>odious</HI> and <HI>immoral</HI> to let them pa&s;s again into &s;lavery." Let us be&s;tow a moment, for a moment will &s;uffice, to detect the &s;ophi&s;try of each of the&s;e arguments.</P>
<P>Admitting that &s;laves may become booty, and that their property becomes ve&s;ted in the captor, has he not a right to re&s;tore them, if he plea&s;es, at a peace? did not this city belong to the king of Great-Britain by conque&s;t? and did he not agree to evacuate it, rather than continue an unequal war? did not the American artillery, which he found in our forts, be|long to him by the &s;ame right; yet he agreed to leave it be|hind? when he finds how ably his infractions of the treaty are defended by our own citizens, he will, no doubt, regret that he evacuated New-York as &s;oon as he did; for the &s;ame argument <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d by Camillus to ju&s;tify his detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, would apply equally &s;trong to his having kept garri&s;ons till this time in our &s;ea-ports, the prompt evacuation of which this writer con&s;iders rather as a matter of grace in his maje&s;ty, than of &s;trict obligation on his part. To return&mdash;as the negroes which were taken, belonged to the king, he might prefer re&s;toring them to their former owners, rather than be encumbered with their maintenance, which would probably have been the con&s;equence of giving them freedom; to have &s;old them, would have ill comported with his dignity. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered al&s;o, that in re&s;toring them to their ma&s;|ters, he would take care to receive an equivalent for &s;uch con|ce&s;&s;ion. What this equivalent was, none but the commi&s;&s;ion|ers can know; perhaps they agreed to <HI>recommend</HI> the tories to mercy in con&s;ideration of his maje&s;ty's re&s;toring the negroes: whatever the inducement may have been, he promi&s;es, by an expre&s;&s;ion as latitudinary as can well be devi&s;ed, not to carry
<PB N="77" REF="028389_0653_0FD8EDD2CB005478">away <HI>any</HI> of them, that is, he will leave them <HI>all</HI> whether ac|quired by capture or enticed away by his royal offers. If an ex|ception had been intended, in favor of any cla&s;s, it would have found its way into the treaty: none being made, the de&s;crip|tion mu&s;t either be nugatory, or extend to all the blacks, who were then living, and in the power of his troops, arming them again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and not in making amends for &s;uch an abominable warfare, by &s;ending them home again. But if &s;uch promi&s;es were really made, or if a treaty of amity and alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, actually exi&s;ted between his Britannic maje&s;ty, and who had not been actually carried from the continent before the treaty, the other po&s;ition cannot be &s;upported without charging the king with the greate&s;t du|plicity and want of good faith, which I &s;hall not offend Ca|millus &s;o much as to &s;uppo&s;e his maje&s;ty capable of. It would be odious and immoral, &s;ays he, to return to their former ma&s;|ters, negroes who had joined them on a promi&s;e of liberty. Any other but Camillus would have thought the immorality con&s;i&s;ted in alluring away the &s;warthy dome&s;tics of America. Why not be explicit, and explain with good faith, to the ple|nipotentiaries, the &s;olemn engagement he was under; in&s;tead of &s;tipulating a &s;pecific return, an equivalent might then have been agreed upon; or if faith mu&s;t be broken, either with the negroes, or with the United States, would it not have been a le&s;s reflection on Great-Britain, to give up the former, whom &s;he was no longer able to protect, (as &s;he did the tories) and to whom &s;he was probably under no other than immoral en|gagements, contained in proclamations, i&s;&s;ued upon the &s;ole authority of &s;ome &s;avage officers, than to break, in the very moment of &s;igning, a &s;olemn compact, formally and delibe|rately entered into with the latter? was &s;he not under as &s;olemn engagements to the tories who had e&s;pou&s;ed her cau&s;e, and received protections from her generals; yet their per&s;ons and properties were abandoned, or, which was the &s;ame thing, placed upon the precarious footing of a recommendation on the part of congre&s;s, for favor and pardon to the legi&s;latures of the different &s;tates. Not a man of this de&s;cription who had been bani&s;hed, could return without a law for the purpo&s;e. Does Camillus imagine that the intere&s;ts of the&s;e Africans lay nearer the heart of their gracious monarch, who&s;e virtues and humanity he takes &s;o much plea&s;ure in blazoning, than tho&s;e of his own deluded &s;ubjects, who, notwith&s;tanding his deli|berate &s;acrifice of them, continue as firmly as ever devoted to him.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="028389_0654_0FD8EDD5340CCC70">
But if his maje&s;ty be really (what no one but Camillus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;pect) &s;o &s;crupulous about doing an odious action, or brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing his plighted faith to his black allies, why ju&s;tify him for keeping his wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> at our expen&s;e? If he be as <HI>ju&s;t, magnanimous, and ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nt</HI> as our envoy has repre&s;ented him, why does he not pay for the liberty which he thought it his duty to confer on our &s;laves? Will Camillus pretend that his maje&s;ty's abhor|rence of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avery induced him to carry the&s;e people away? The We&s;t-India I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ands will te&s;tify again&s;t him&mdash;his maje&s;ty, like &s;ome people among our&s;elves (I do not mean the quakers, for I really believe them to act from principle) is a great advocate for manumi&s;&s;ion, when his own intere&s;t or tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ected by it, or when the United States, notwith&s;tand|ing his unbounded affection for them) are alone injured by it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, then, as the Briti&s;h king found that his recent en|gagements with this country could not be executed &s;pecifi|cally without violating his antecedent promi&s;es to the negroes, in&s;tead of quibbling, and putting on his agreement a con&s;truc|tion which rendered it a <HI>dead letter,</HI> he would have acted more con&s;i&s;tent with the character a&s;cribed to him by the friends of the pre&s;ent treaty, by candidly communicating his embarra&s;&s;|ments to our government. We &s;hould readily have con&s;ented to a pecuniary compen&s;ation; Camillus, it is true, a&s;&s;erts, that "when a party promi&s;es a &s;pecific thing, nothing but the thing it&s;elf will &s;atisfy the promi&s;e."&mdash;If Camillus be a lawyer, he certainly knows that nothing is more common than a &s;a|tisfaction in damages for the breach of a promi&s;e to do a &s;pecific thing; and that in a great variety of ca&s;es it is the only &s;atisfac|tion to which the law can or will compel the deliquent party; and that &s;uch damages being paid, the promi&s;e is as completely &s;atisfied as by doing of the &s;pecific thing. Thus, if a per&s;on con|tract to deliver me a &s;hip, or a hor&s;e which he afterwards &s;ells to another, or to come nearer to the ca&s;e before us, he engages to re&s;tore me a negro which he afterwards &s;ends away, and thus puts a &s;pecific performance out of his power, my only claim again&s;t him is for a compen&s;ation commen&s;urate to the injury &s;u&s;tained by his breach of promi&s;e. It would be ab&s;urd in the extreme for America, at this time, to in&s;i&s;t upon a re|turn of tho&s;e negroes. Many are dead; and of tho&s;e who &s;ur|vive, the greater part mu&s;t be in the decline of life, and would be of little u&s;e to their former ma&s;ters. A compen&s;ation then is all that can be a&s;ked; this is preci&s;ely the controver&s;y between the two governments. The United States (and Camillus will not contend again&s;t their right &s;o to do) relea&s;e G. Britain from
<PB N="79" REF="028389_0655_0FD8EDD5CFF84990">a &s;pecific compliance, and in&s;i&s;t upon an equivalent in money. With what other view, then, but to deceive, does Camillus ob|&s;erve, that "the party to whom a promi&s;e is made, cannot be required to accept in lieu of in an equivalent? Did he not know that the United States were willing to receive, and a&s;ked for nothing more than an equivalent, &s;o that there could be no ne|ce&s;&s;ity of enquiring into the right of Great-Britain to force them to it?</P>
<P>It is proper to &s;ubjoin, that the con&s;truction of this article by Camillus, is oppo&s;ed to the interpretation which our go|verment have uniformly put upon it, is contrary to the expla|nation of it by mr. Jeffer&s;on, who&s;e corre&s;pondence with mr. Hammond is recommended, as the be&s;t antidote again&s;t the mi&s;chievous and humiliating doctrines, &s;o warmly inculcated by this writer. Every American will turn with plea&s;ure from a laboured panegyric of the Briti&s;h government, a &s;trenuous and uncandid vindication of all its arbitrary proceedings to|wards this country, and from the degrading repre&s;entation of the United States, which fill &s;o many columns of Camillus, to the manly, energetic, dignified, and yet candid examination of Jeffer&s;on. In the writings of this invaluable &s;tate&s;man, he will di&s;cover the true &s;ource of controver&s;y between the two coun|tries. He will be &s;hocked at the perfidy and duplicity of Great-Britain, and will be a&s;toni&s;hed at the forbearance of the United States, under the mo&s;t aggravated and unprovoked in&s;ults and injuries. It is a work which &s;hould be in the hands of every man. It will teach us to love and re&s;pect our country, a duty which cannot be too &s;trongly inculcated, when pains are taken to infu&s;e a contrary &s;entiment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only a&s;k, if Camillus is right, how happened it, that a majority of the Senate, at their late &s;e&s;&s;ion, agreed to advi&s;e the Pre&s;ident to renew negociations with his maje&s;ty for a compen&s;ation for the negroes who had been carried away con|trary to the 7th article of the treaty of peace? When &s;o many re&s;pectable authorities concur re&s;pecting this aggre&s;&s;ion, it would evince a becoming mode&s;ty in Camillus to retract an opinion which ought to find advocates only in the Briti&s;h Cabi|net.</P>

<P>FAITHFUL to his promi&s;e, and meditating an attack upon mr.

America being unable to extend her protection to an immen&s;e frontier, her citizens were driven from their farms&mdash;their property made a prey of; and they deemed them&s;elves happy, when they could e&s;cape from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination into exile and penury. Our &s;eas and coa&s;ts &s;warmed with privateers, fitted out by the&s;e internal enemies; and even the Indians of America were piloted by them, to the peaceful dwellings of her citizens, and female and infants' &s;calps were often di&s;played as the joint triumph of tho&s;e mon|&s;ters of the human race! Who then can be a&s;toni&s;hed, that the&s;e provocations, which were repeating every day, &s;hould excite the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ations of indignation and re&s;entment? Who then can wonder, that our legi&s;lature &s;hould pa&s;s an act, which was not only extorted by a &s;en&s;e of injury, and the ex|igencies of the times, but was peculiarly calculated to protect our c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">zens from future plunder, and held out a gleam of hope to the&s;e who had already been &s;tripped of their all, by this ruthle&s;s and unfeeling band? Forgive me, &s;ir, if I de&s;cribe your pre&s;ent friends in glowing colours. Humanity wi&s;hed to forget forever, deeds of cruelty and horror, at the bare men|tion of which, the mo&s;t obdurate and rugged heart rovolts. America was content to drop the curtain on a tragedy, the cata&s;trophe of which had confounded the adver&s;aries of her freedom and &s;overeignty. This &s;tate in particular, [New-York] although her trade and frontiers had &s;uffered the mo&s;t, early manife&s;ted a conciliating and forgiving &s;pirit. Per&s;ons who had betrayed the mo&s;t rancorous temper, and had been ba|ni&s;hed for their enmity and <HI>poverty</HI> of &s;pirit, were permitted to return to the bo&s;om of their offended country. Men who had evidenced not only in principle, but in action, the mo&s;t rooted ho&s;tility to our freedom and government, were permit|ted to remain, and to become a part of the great body politic. In&s;tances, without number, of forbearance, lenity, and even of tenderne&s;s, forgivene&s;s, and &s;incere reconciliation, might be produced; even rewards and public honors and offices have been be&s;towed on the&s;e men. Far from condemning a policy, to which, however, there were many objections, I glory in the liberality and munificence of my country. Nor was it my wi&s;h to re&s;cue from oblivion, a memorial of the conduct of tho&s;e who have been objects of their country's genero&s;ity and forgivene&s;s. Camillus has courted, nay provoked the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. When it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to exculpate our country from the reproach of cruelty and breach of &s;aith, we mu&s;t be permitted
<PB N="82" REF="028389_0658_0FD8EDDE0653FAD8">to return to the times which produced the act, which, it is pretended, fixes this &s;tigma upon her. If Camillus had taken this trouble, he would have &s;een &s;o much room for recrimina|tion, that in tenderne&s;s to the feelings of the&s;e unhappy men, he would have forborne &s;ome of his &s;evere animadver&s;ions on the conduct of this &s;tate.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated &s;ome of the provocations and inducements, we come now to the law it&s;elf, in which Camillus di&s;cerns one of the earlie&s;t breaches of the treaty of peace, on our part; Ca|millus was not more unhappy in reminding us of the conduct of the tories, than he is unfortunate in this fir&s;t proof which lie in&s;tances of our breach of faith. The law to which he re|fers, is well known by the appellation of the tre&s;pa&s;s act. This law pa&s;&s;ed the 17th March, 1783. A mind, not warped by prejudice, nor di&s;po&s;ed to deceive it&s;elf, is at &s;ome difficulty to imagine how an act, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix months before the definitive treaty was &s;igned, and more than a year, according to Camil|lus, before it became binding on the king, can be tortured in|to an infraction of that very treaty. At the time of pa&s;&s;ing this law, the legi&s;lature had a perfect right &s;o to do; nay, it was part of their duty,&mdash;the war yet raged with unabated ri|gor: as the royal cau&s;e became more and more de&s;perate, its friends became proportionably alert in their efforts to revenge a &s;ucce&s;s, to which they could not reconcile them&s;elves. Their la&s;t cruelties exceeded any of a former date. Every mea&s;ure therefore, which tended to curb the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our do|me&s;tic foes, to mitigate or check the horrors of a civil war, and to protect tho&s;e of our citizens who&s;e remote re&s;idence pre|vented their receiving any adequate &s;ecurity from the Ameri|can army, was not only prudent, but nece&s;&s;ary, ju&s;tifiable, and humane. It was al&s;o believed, that few, if any, of the depreda|tions and robberies, which were committed by the new levies and refugees, were at the time &s;anctioned by any military or|der; their own fury, and a thir&s;t for plunder and revenge led them on; yet if a military order was admitted to ju&s;tify their conduct, how ea&s;y would it have been to obtain one? Every man who had &s;tolen a hor&s;e, a cow, or other property, without any authority, and converted the proceeds to his own u&s;e (and there were thou&s;ands who pur&s;ued no other bu&s;ine&s;s) would have &s;heltered him&s;elf from a ju&s;t compen&s;ation, under an or|der, which might at any time have been procured. The legi&s;|lature al&s;o knew for it was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t enlighten|ed and meritorious patriots of the day, notwith&s;tanding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dium which is now to be fixed upon it) that if any of the pro|vi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">

<P>Camillus, it is true, does not admit that treaties, made un|der the confederation, were paramount to the antecedent laws of the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. Proceeding, however, with more caution than u&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e does not flatly deny the po&s;ition, but contents him|&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that it was a "que&s;tion of <HI>theory,</HI> about which there was room for, and in this country did exi&s;t, much diver&s;ity of opinion." What is meant by any law being a que&s;tion of theory, I do not well comprehend. What is the law in any particular ca&s;e, in a foreign country, we have ever been taught to con&s;ider a que&s;tion of <HI>fact</HI> and not of theory; and lord Mansfield declares, that &s;uch laws mu&s;t be proved <HI>as facts.</HI> What the law may be, in any given ca&s;e, may be a mat|ter of uncertainty, and not known to every one, but it is &s;till a que&s;tion of fact, whether it be, as &s;tated by one per&s;on or another. Where this diver&s;ity of opinion prevails, courts of ju&s;tice alone can &s;ettle the que&s;tion; and until this is done, we mu&s;t re&s;ort, for information, to our national engagements, and the opinions of profe&s;&s;ional men. I do not mean to admit, that our courts have not determined the que&s;tion; for it will be &s;een in the &s;equel, (and it is &s;omewhat my&s;terious that it &s;hould have e&s;caped the penetration of Camillus) that our courts have &s;olemnly adjudged in favour of the treaty, when interfering with a contrary municipal regulation.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion de&s;erves a more minute examination; for if it can be &s;hown, that all &s;tate laws, contravening the treaty of peace, were thereby repealed, and rendered null as to their fu|ture operation, all the elaborate rea&s;oning of Camillus, and its &s;uper&s;tructure, will be overthrown, and he him&s;elf be compel|led, however reluctantly, to impute the fir&s;t infraction to the account of Great-Britain. The propo&s;ition is &s;o &s;elf-evident to an American lawyer, that without any proof, it forces the &s;ame conviction on his mind, as the plaine&s;t axioms of Euclid, "that the whole is greater than a part," or, "that all right angles are equal to one another," do upon that of a mathema|tician. To prove either, appears a work of &s;upererogation; however, as the doubt is rai&s;ed, we will attempt a &s;olution of it.</P>
<P>By the 9th article of the confederation, "the United State; in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, have the <HI>&s;ole</HI> and <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> right of en|tering into treaties and alliances." The&s;e articles were acceded
<PB N="84" REF="028389_0660_0FD8EDE4C3831410">to by this &s;tate, by a &s;olemn act of its legi&s;lature, pa&s;&s;ed the 6th of February, 1778. The people, therefore, of this &s;tate were as much parties to the treaty of Paris, as if they had been pre|&s;ent in their proper per&s;ons, and individually affixed their &s;ig|natures to it. How then could its binding force upon them ever become a que&s;tion? Has Great-Britain ever entertained a doubt on the &s;ubject? Can one party to a contract annul it without the other's con&s;ent? Hence it follows, not only that treaties made under the confederation, were &s;upreme laws of the land, but that they were &s;o in a &s;en&s;e much more exten|&s;ive and emphatical than could be applied to an act of the legi&s;|lature. While the latter could be repealed or altered, the for|mer could no wi&s;e be effected by a legi&s;lative act. Of little force, therefore, is the ob&s;ervation of Camillus, that "in the opinion of the legi&s;lature of Virginia, there were acts which had prevented, and might prevent the recovery of debts, accor|ding to the treaty." The legi&s;lature of Virginia may make, but cannot expound even its own laws, much le&s;s laws or compacts to which that &s;tate was only <HI>one</HI> of <HI>many</HI> parties. Their expo&s;i|tion belongs &s;olely and exclu&s;ively to the judicial department. The&s;e (but perhaps it was unknown to Camillus) are the &s;enti|ments of the legi&s;lature of that very &s;tate. In an act of October, 1787, it is declared, "that it does not belong to the legi&s;la|ture to decide particular que&s;tions, of which the judiciary have cognizance, and that therefore it was unfit for them to deter|mine on the validity of certain payments." The opinion, there|fore, of any legi&s;lature on laws which already exi&s;t, is entitled to no attention; much le&s;s does &s;uch an opinion dimini&s;h the obligation or efficacy of them. Even in pa&s;&s;ing laws, if they exceed their authority (which may be the ca&s;e) courts of ju&s;|tice will di&s;regard and refu&s;e to carry them into effect. If a ca&s;e had been cited, of the &s;upreme judicial tribunal of Virgi|nia rendering a judgment conformable to what is &s;tared as the opinion of its legi&s;lature, it would have been in point, and not ea&s;y to reconcile to the injunctions of the treaty.</P>
<P>After producing this opinion, Camillus demands, with an air of triumph and &s;atisfaction, as if he had detected mr. Jeffer|&s;on in a mi&s;repre&s;entation; "with what truth has it been a&s;&s;ert|ed, that it was at all times perfectly under&s;tood, that treaties controuled the laws of the &s;tates? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e it could not be otherwi&s;e, and that not only mr. Jeffer&s;on, but &s;everal profe&s;|&s;ional and other characters of eminence, whom he con&s;ulted, (for exten&s;ive as his own experience was, he did not think it derogated from a mini&s;ter of a free nation to collect informa|tion
<PB N="85" REF="028389_0661_0FD8EDE68AD78EF8">from his fellow citizens) concurred in this opinion. It may well be doubted, whether any lawyer has ever &s;eriou&s;ly advo|cated a contrary propo&s;ition. "It re&s;ulted," &s;ays mr. Jeffer|&s;on, "from the in&s;trument of confederation, among the &s;tates, that treaties made by congre&s;s, according to the confederation, were &s;uperior to the laws of the &s;tates." He adds, "we may &s;afely affirm this to have been the general &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e at lea&s;t who were of the profe&s;&s;ion of the law." Mr. Jeffer&s;on, we &s;hall &s;ee, did not &s;peak at random, nor without authority, nor is he chargeable with the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;repre&s;entation. It gives me plea&s;ure, I confe&s;s, to re&s;cue the character of this gentleman, which has forced the admiration of America, from the a&s;per|&s;ions of an anonimous writer, who&s;e lucubrations hitherto may be regarded rather as a formal cen&s;ure of his official conduct, than a vindication of the Engli&s;h treaty. Does it excite &s;ur|prize, that Camillus wi&s;hes to render him odious? In his own writings the rea&s;on may be di&s;covered. "Mr. Jeffer&s;on," &s;ays he, "is a candidate for the pre&s;idential chair!"</P>
<P>Governor Collins, mr. Channing, di&s;trict attorney for Rhode-I&s;land, governor Huntington, mr. Lewis, di&s;trict attorney for Penn&s;ylvania, mr. Monroe, a &s;enator from Virginia, and now mini&s;ter in France, and mr. Harri&s;on, our di&s;trict attorney, and a gentleman of well learned legal reputation, have all &s;anctioned an opinion, which Camillus would fain per&s;uade us is a matter of doubt. The name of Hamilton, who&s;e legal ac|quirements, and other &s;plendid talents, have &s;o often a&s;toni&s;h|ed his fellow citizens, and who&s;e authority it is pre&s;umed, will not be di&s;puted by Camillus, may al&s;o be added to a li&s;t already re&s;pectable. In the ca&s;e of Waddington and Rutgers, which has been oftener mentioned than its importance de&s;er|ved, he was council for the defendant, and advi&s;ed his client to rely on the treaty of peace, which plea was allowed by the court. It will not be impertinent here to notice a remark of Camillus, not as a proof of candour, but of his &s;olicitude to mi&s;lead: "though," &s;ays he, "there may have been no formal deci&s;ion of <HI>our</HI> courts, enforcing the exceptionable principles of the tre&s;pa&s;s act, yet there never was a deci&s;on of a &s;upreme court again&s;t it." Did not Camillus know, that the &s;upreme court had decided again&s;t principles as exceptionable in other acts, merely becau&s;e they were at war with the treaty of peace? He knew it, and it would have been no reflection on his candour to have &s;tated the in&s;tances. Not having done &s;o, the following extract of a letter from mr. Harri&s;on to mr. Jeffer&s;on, will remind him of &s;ome ca&s;es in which he was pro|bably
<PB N="86" REF="028389_0662_0FD8ED094C509298">concerned as coun&s;el for one of the parties.&mdash;"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> operation of this act," &s;ays he, &s;peaking of the act relative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> debts due to per&s;ons within the enemy's lines, "became &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> after the peace, a &s;ubject of much complaint, grounded upon that article of the treaty which forbids any impediment to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money of all bona fide debts, and that which declares that no per&s;on &s;hall &s;uffer any future lo&s;s in his per&s;on, liberty, or property.

Among the &s;ubterfuges, calculated to fix a reproach upon the United States, may be cla&s;&s;ed the remark of Camillus, that, "under the confederation, they had no courts of their own to expound and enforce their trea|ties as laws." We are at a lo&s;s which to cen&s;ure mo&s;t in this ob&s;ervation; its want of candour, or the unqualified reflection it carries with it on the &s;tate judiciaries. If treaties were laws of the land, which, perhaps, was never &s;eriou&s;ly doubted, were not the &s;tate judges, then, as much as the federal judges are now, &s;worn and bound to conform to, and make them the rule of their deci&s;ions? He &s;ubjoins, with becoming delicacy, "it was believed that a majority of our &s;upreme court bench would over-rule the plea of a military order." How was this di&s;covery made? did the judges favour him with an extra-judicial opi|nion? or was he gifted with the &s;pirit of divination? Thus, be|lief, &s;urmi&s;es, and &s;u&s;picions mu&s;t be re&s;orted to, to fix upon our &s;tate, the ignominious charge of breaking her &s;olemn enga|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ents with foreign powers. To the credit of our bench, it ought to be mentioned, that it has, ever &s;ince the peace, been filled with characters of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed reputation and integrity, and that the confidence in&s;pired by their deci&s;ions, has been &s;o great, that perhaps in no &s;tate in the union, is le&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s done in the federal court, than in New-York. It would hardly receive credit, was I to mention how very few civil actions have been commenced in the&s;e courts, &s;ince their organization in this &s;tate.</P>
<P>It cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to follow Camillus through his in|vidious enumeration of the other acts of this, and other &s;tates, which he con&s;iders as violations of the treaty; the &s;ame an&s;wer applies to all. The treaty could not be controuled by any &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but it is alleged, that in &s;ome ca&s;es, repealing acts were deemed nece&s;&s;ary by the legi&s;latures of the different &s;tates. This does not alter the ca&s;e. It was done for the greater cau|tion, and furni&s;hes proofs of a &s;incere &s;pirit of accommodation. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome &s;tates, a repeal would probably not have taken place, of their legi&s;latures had not ob&s;erved the laws in que&s;tion had already yielded to the &s;uperior mandates of the treaty.</P>

<HEAD>CINNA.&mdash;No. III.</HEAD>
<P>IF Camillus, in&s;tead of vindicating mr. Jay, at the expen&s;e of his country's faith, had recurred to his official reports, while &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, an apology would have pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, not quite &s;o grateful perhaps to the pride of his friend; but le&s;s con&s;trained, and more agreeable to truth, than the one which he has a&s;&s;igned. It is well known that mr. Jay, while at the head of that department, either from want of in|formation, or from taking a le&s;s comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;ubject than his &s;ucce&s;&s;or did, or from &s;ome other le&s;s pardon|able motive, in very unqualified language, not only excu&s;ed Great-Britain for her infraction of the treaty, but threw the whole cen&s;ure on this country. It was ea&s;ily fore&s;een that the negociation in the hands of a man, thus committed, mu&s;t ei|ther
<PB N="90" REF="028389_0666_0FD8EDF3F39CF3A0">prove abortive, or terminate, as it has done, di&s;honorably to America. A virtuous minority in the Senate, remon&s;trated in vain again&s;t an appointment which was not only a direct attack upon the con&s;titution, by de&s;troying the independence of the judiciary, but which, from the character of the envoy, au|gured nothing but di&s;appointment and ignominy. Mr. Jay's ho&s;tility to the French revolution was al&s;o well known. This enmity betrayed it&s;elf, not only in his more private &s;entiments and conver&s;ation, but was mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly di&s;played in the libel, which he, in concert with one of our &s;enators, publi&s;h|e&s;t again&s;t the mini&s;ter of that republic. The manife&s;t object of that too-celebrated certificate was to di&s;credit the French cau&s;e, and to extingui&s;h that enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour for its &s;ucce&s;s, which had become almo&s;t univer&s;al in the United States. The attack upon mr. Genet terminated unfortunately and di&s;repu|tably for the contrivers of it: it was not therefore to be expected that a man (who&s;e very friends impute to him, a temper border|ing on the vindictive) &s;hould over forgive the triumph of a mi|ni&s;ter, who not only exonerated him&s;elf from the charge, but in a manner the mo&s;t public and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> equivocal, convicted his an|tagoni&s;ts of having propagated a deliberate mi&s;repre&s;entation. It will be recollected, that mr. Jay's <HI>own</HI> witne&s;s proved the innocence of mr. Genet. What could America look for from an envoy, who&s;e mind had been recently embittered again&s;t the French, by a per&s;onal defeat, but as many marks of animo|&s;ity towards that people as could decently be in&s;erted in a pub|lic treaty. The&s;e ob&s;ervations may at fir&s;t appear impertinent, and no wi&s;e connected with the merits of the treaty; but when Camillus, and every other writer in favor of it, uniformly re|pre&s;ent mr. Jay as the propere&s;t man in America to have been entru&s;ted with the negociation, and hence infer that it cannot be bad, it becomes u&s;eful to examine the po&s;ition, and to &s;how, as has been done, that a more unfit character could not have been &s;ent upon &s;o important an emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, the documents afterwards collected by the indu&s;try of mr. Jeffer&s;on, and his ma&s;terly rea&s;oning upon them, placed the que&s;tions, which had been conceded by mr. Jay, in a light which di&s;&s;ipated all objections, and carried con|viction to every unprejudiced mind. That mr. Jay, therefore, would have nothing to do but to bring forward the arguments which had already been managed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s by the American &s;ecretary. But tho&s;e who rea&s;on in this way, forget how difficult it is for a man who &s;tands committed on record, to renounce his errors. From pride of opinion, and inordinate
<PB N="91" REF="028389_0667_0FD8EDF6C3928D00">&s;elf-e&s;teem, no one is exempt; how then were we to hope that mr. Jay, after hazarding opinions on this &s;ide of the Atlantic, which had already proved the bane of his country, in all her &s;ub&s;equent negociations with Great-Britain, &s;hould recede im|mediately on his arrival at the court of St. James's, where every pains and flattery would be practi&s;ed, to keep him in good hu|mour? Be&s;ides, his &s;entiments being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, might be u&s;ed to great advantage, if he attempted to change his ground. Rather, therefore, than recede at the ex|pen&s;e of his reputation, and at a certainty of being &s;elf-convic|ted of contradiction and incon&s;i&s;tency, every &s;ubtility and fi|ne&s;&s;e would be put in u&s;e, and in the la&s;t re&s;ort, the intere&s;ts of America would be regarded as a &s;mall &s;acrifice to per&s;onal honor. The envoy well knew, that however important the&s;e &s;a|crifices might be, men would not be wanting to applaud the wicked deed, and to blazen to the world his pa&s;t &s;ervices and patrioti&s;m. The event has corre&s;ponded with his expectations. In&s;tead of declaring, which would have been the language of &s;incerity and candor, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for mr. Jay, who was already committed, to invite a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with the Briti&s;h ca|binet, every deception is practi&s;ed to impo&s;e upon the public, a belief that &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in the hands of any one, mu&s;t have been inau&s;picious to the United States, and the efforts of mr. Jeffer&s;on, to re&s;cue us from the ba&s;e imputation of his pre|dece&s;&s;or in office, are contemptuou&s;ly &s;tiled "a mere e&s;&s;ay of polemical &s;kill, or a convenient ingredient of negociation."</P>
<P>Citizens of America! be on your guard. Since the epoch of your independence, a more important cri&s;is than the pre&s;ent, never pre&s;ented it&s;elf. To entice you into an approbation of a compact too degrading to be vindicated, arts, as ba&s;e as the in&s;trument it&s;elf, are put in practice&mdash;your confidence in a mini&s;ter, who never cea&s;ed to defend your rights, and who was forced from his high &s;tation by the prevalence of a Briti&s;h faction, is attempted to be &s;haken. His manly and energetic expo&s;ition of your violated rights is turned into ridicule&mdash;his candor is impeached, and his patriotic labours in your &s;ervice are branded as the offspring of "hollowne&s;s and fallacy." Men, like the&s;e, are, if you follow the pernicious coun&s;el of Camillus, to be "expelled from your confidence." The&s;e are the men a|gain&s;t whom you are cautioned, as laying "artful &s;nares for your peace !" Are un&s;upported &s;ugge&s;tions, like the&s;e, the effu|&s;ions of patrioti&s;m and virtue? Do they not betray, notwith|&s;tanding a thou&s;and profe&s;&s;ions to the contrary, a mind ho&s;tile to your internal peace, and tainted with the corruptions of a
<PB N="92" REF="028389_0668_0FD8EDFB82DC2D80">Biti&s;h court! If you pur&s;ue &s;uch intemperate advice, and expel from your confidence, men of the de&s;cription glanced at by Camillus, where will the expul&s;ion end? a pro&s;cription more dreadful than that of Robe&s;pierre will &s;ucceed. The fir&s;t and be&s;t patriots of America will fall victims, and all to gratify the in&s;atiable ambition of a few a&s;piring individuals, who can brook no oppo&s;ition, and unle&s;s they can controul public af|fairs, are perpetually di&s;&s;eminating calumnies, and &s;owing the &s;eeds of civil di&s;&s;ention and di&s;cord. This is remarkably the ca&s;e with the writer, who&s;e defence, as it is hitherto ludicrou&s;ly termed, has occa&s;ioned the&s;e remarks. His preliminary ob&s;er|vations, and but little el&s;e has yet appeared in his fir&s;t &s;ix numbers, are calculated to impre&s;s a belief, that an oppo&s;i|tion to the treaty originated with the <HI>per&s;onal enemies</HI> of mr. Jay, or with tho&s;e who have been uniformly oppo&s;ed to the general government. The&s;e remarks partake more of intempe|rance and illiberality than of argument. As an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions, they may be overlooked, but if they are de&s;igned to convince our rea&s;on, we turn from them with pity and con|tempt. What, &s;ir, are the per&s;onal enemies of mr. Jay di&s;per&s;|ed from one end of the continent to the other? Many re&s;pec|table names, who &s;tand foremo&s;t in the oppo&s;ition, are, or have been, his friends. They regret the wounds which his feelings mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain by their oppo&s;ition to an a&s;&s;ociation in which he has borne &s;o con&s;picuous a part; but the calls of patrioti&s;m have &s;tifled tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, and it is a circum&s;tance, certainly not favourable to the treaty, that many men, who had been in the habits of intimacy, and of thinking well of mr. Jay, have been mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed in their expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t it. That mr. Jay has his per&s;onal enemies, is not doubted; no man is with|out them; and perhaps it would be difficult to a&s;&s;ign any good rea&s;on why he &s;hould be exempt from this common lot of hu|manity: but that the&s;e enemies have invariably arrayed them|&s;elves under the banners of oppo&s;ition, remains for Camillus to prove.</P>
<P>The other a&s;&s;ertion is le&s;s excu&s;able, becau&s;e Camillus well knew, that among tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the treaty, were &s;ome of the be&s;t friends to the national government; &s;ome who had not only &s;igned, but had ever warmly &s;upported the con|&s;titution of the United States. The names of Langdon, Pinck|ney and Rutledge, appear to the con&s;titution of the United States. I &s;hould prove as tedious as Camillus, were I to enu|merate all the in&s;tances which occur of the mo&s;t zealous fe|derali&s;ts, who have every where appeared among the oppo&s;ers
<PB N="93" REF="028389_0669_0FD8EDFCD074D848">of this infamous compact. Not only the political characters, but the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by tho&s;e who condemn the treaty, have fallen under the la&s;h of his pen. No excu&s;e can be offer|ed for his mi&s;repre&s;entations on this &s;ubject&mdash;That the town meeting of Bo&s;ton denounced it the very day after its arrival, and, without a reading, is an a&s;&s;ertion directly oppo&s;ed to all the te&s;timony we have of their proceedings. The account of our own town-meeting, and of the manner in which it was obtained is too gro&s;s to impo&s;e on any of the citizens of New-York. Who are intended by the "leaders of the clubs" who were &s;een harranging at every corner, to &s;tir up the citizens of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">imitate the example of Bo&s;ton, I am at a lo&s;s to a&s;certain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me of the mo&s;t active enemies of the treaty belong to no club at all; and in&s;tead of taking pains to induce the citizens to a&s;&s;emble &s;uch was the univer&s;al execration in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty was regarded in New-York, that it was with &s;ome dif|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ty the meeting was po&s;tponed to &s;o late a day. That a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ectable body</HI> of the merchants endeavoured to moderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> violence, and promote a &s;pirit favourable to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ports as little with the fact as &s;everal of the a&s;&s;ertions which have been already noticed.

Jay, or a wicked de|&s;ire to overthrow the government, and introduce anarchy and civil di&s;cord&mdash;and that a war with Great-Britain will be the inevitable con&s;equence of a rejection. The&s;e remarks have al|ready been oppo&s;ed by others, which, unle&s;s I mi&s;take, have not only detected their &s;ophi&s;try, but expo&s;ed their pernicious tendency. Admitting all the&s;e matters to be exactly as &s;tated by Camillus, how do they ju&s;tify an inference that the treaty is a good one? They may prove that Great-Britain cannot be expected to make an equal commercial connection with this country; but will it thence follow, that we are bound to make a di&s;advantageous one with her? No opinion is better found|ed, or prevails more univer&s;ally, than that the fewer European connections we form the better. We po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of a growing and exten&s;ive commerce. The articles we export, particularly provi&s;ions and raw materials, being of the fir&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity towards the &s;upport and manufactures of other coun|tries, there is no danger of not finding a market for them. To Britain, in particular, our commerce is of the highe&s;t impor|tance. In return for the manufactures which we take from her European dominions, we &s;end her provi&s;ions and raw ma|terials, The balance, which is generally again&s;t us, we pay in &s;pecie. It will, therefore, certainly be her intere&s;t and policy to continue and extend a trade &s;o lucrative and important, without a treaty. If &s;he choo&s;es to keep all her We&s;t-India ports &s;hut again&s;t us, we can obtain from the i&s;lands of other powers the &s;ame articles which they produce; and, in times of &s;carcity, which very frequently occur, they mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to America for provi&s;ions and lumber. In every re&s;pect they are more dependent upon us, than we are upon them; and we &s;hall &s;oon force from them a much more advantage|ous trade than we can expect to obtain by treaty.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, America &s;hould keep the &s;taff of com|merce in her own hands. She ought not, except in very par|ticular ca&s;es, to form treaties of commerce. If &s;he remains un|fettered, &s;he may avail her&s;elf of any advantage which may of|fer from the imprudence or &s;ituation of other countries. Let her make &s;uch regulations as are be&s;t calculated to promote a &s;pirit of enterprize&mdash;to add to her riches, and to increa&s;e the indu&s;try of her inhabitants, and let her have courage and con&s;tancy enough, never to depart from them in favour of &s;trangers. In her pre&s;ent defencele&s;s and infant &s;tate, it is next to madne&s;s to attempt forming a connection with this nation, without making &s;acrifices, and con&s;enting to re&s;traints far be|yond
<PB N="98" REF="028389_0674_0FD8EE0E96E09CF8">tho&s;e which the laws of nations impo&s;e, which ought per|haps to form the only rule between two commercial powers. But if a treaty with Great-Britain, under any circum&s;tances, be proper, why in&s;ert in it matters which have no relation to commerce, and which properly form materials for a &s;eparate connection? I mean the re&s;pective complaints of the two go|vernments again&s;t each other. By in&s;erting provi&s;ions for an adju&s;tment of the&s;e complaints in a treaty of commerce, Great-Britain has not only exacted unrea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions for them on our part; but if a ratification does not eventually take place, the whole ground mu&s;t be again travelled over, and probably at a time when Great-Britain will be in a &s;ituation to hold a tone &s;till more haughty and imperious than &s;he now does. Perhaps, indeed, this was one rea&s;on which induced the advi&s;ers of the mea&s;ure to keep from the &s;enate the real ob|ject of mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion; certain it is, that from the pre&s;i|dent's me&s;&s;age, they had as much rea&s;on to believe that an alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, was in agitation with Great-Britain, as a treaty of commerce; and yet by the con&s;titu|tion, all treaties are to be made "by and with the <HI>advice</HI> and con&s;ent of the &s;ena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">." The plain meaning of this clau&s;e is, that no treaty &s;hall be negociated without the <HI>advice,</HI> nor ra|tified without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate. This con&s;truction has been &s;anctioned on other occa&s;ions, by the pre&s;ident him&s;elf. Even with Indian treaties, he has, previous to negociation, &s;ubmitted to them the contents and taken their advice on every part.</P>
<P>The term, <HI>advice</HI> refers naturally and obviou&s;ly to negoci|ation. Would it not be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that advice was nece&s;&s;a|ry after a thing was done? Con&s;ent alone could then be re|quired. There is, be&s;ides, a manife&s;t propriety in the pre&s;ident's con&s;ulting the &s;enate before hand. The per&s;on employed to negociate would then act with the greater confidence, know|ing, that his in&s;tructions proceeded not from the pre&s;ident alone, but were the re&s;ult of the accumulated wi&s;dom of the &s;enate: there would be le&s;s danger, al&s;o, of a refu&s;al to ratify on their part, which may &s;ometimes be productive of nation|al jealou&s;ies, wars and other calamities, it being unu&s;ual not to ratify a treaty made with a mini&s;ter properly appointed and in&s;tructed. Thus, whether we con&s;ider the policy of making any treaty with Great-Britain, as an ab&s;tract que&s;tion, or the &s;ecret and clande&s;tine manner in which the pre&s;ent one origi|nated, we &s;hall find much room for doubt and cen&s;ure. But it will be &s;aid, we have already treaties of commerce with France
<PB N="99" REF="028389_0675_0FD8EE0F86617028">and other nations; true, and the one with France, though in every re&s;pect more favourable than the one under con&s;idera|tion, has been the occa&s;ion of much perplexity and embarra&s;&s;|ment to our government in the pre&s;ent war. Let ever &s;o much care be u&s;ed to make them explicit, and leave no room for con&s;truction, &s;till doubts will ari&s;e, in the &s;olution of which, not only the parties immediately concerned, but other na|tions, become deeply intere&s;ted. This has been the ca&s;e with the French treaty. Mr. Genet, in behalf of his republic, con|tended that the right of arming privateers in our ports, and other privileges, were &s;ecured to it by the treaty; all the other belligerent nations became parties to, or were intere&s;ted in the controver&s;y; and had not our government oppo&s;ed a claim, which was certainly ill-founded, a war with them might have been the con&s;equence. But if we had no treaty at all with France, we might, as a neutral nation, have opened our ports to the privateers and prizes of all the powers at war, without giving offence to any. Our other treaties, therefore, in&s;tead of militating in favour of &s;uch conections, furni&s;h very &s;trong&punc; and, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, very <HI>feeling</HI> arguments again&s;t them.</P>
<P>While on this &s;ubject, I cannot forbear to remark, that a nation weak at &s;ea, as America now is, and mu&s;t ever conti|nue, unle&s;s a different &s;y&s;tem is &s;peedily adopted, can never promi&s;e her&s;elf any good from the &s;tricte&s;t commercial &s;tipula|tions on the part of a nation which is emphatically become mi&s;tre&s;s of the ocean. With &s;uch a power we had better have no connections, except &s;uch as ari&s;e out of the laws of nations. We &s;hall not only be inclined, but compelled to ob&s;erve our engagements, while Great-Britain will regard them only as long as &s;he finds it her intere&s;t, and will laugh, if not in&s;ult us, when we complain of her infractions.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;ixth number of Camillus, in which he accounts for no provi&s;ion appearing in the treaty again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ing our &s;eamen. The object is admitted to be of the la&s;t importance to the United States; but Camillus is at a lo&s;s to know how it could have been done. "A general &s;tipulation again&s;t it," &s;ays he, "would have been nugatory, if not <HI>de|regatory.</HI>" Could there be any thing derogatory in Great-Britain &s;aying &s;he would ab&s;tain from an infamous practice, which perhaps no nation but America ever &s;ubmitted to &s;o long and &s;o patiently. If her exi&s;tence and &s;afety depend up|on her maritime &s;uperiority, is this &s;uperiority to be maintained at our expen&s;e? Is one of our mo&s;t u&s;eful cla&s;&s;es of citizens
<PB N="100" REF="028389_0676_0FD8EEE6053C2238">to be forced into her &s;ervice, and add to her aggrandizement, to the ruin of our own commerce? and when we a&s;k her to &s;tipulate again&s;t &s;uch outrages in future, is in&s;ult to be added to injury? Are we to be told, that until the Americans change their language and looks, it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;criminate be|tween the &s;eamen of the two nations? Methinks every &s;ea|man found on board of an American ve&s;&s;el, and &s;peaking Engli&s;h, &s;hould be, prima facie, deemed a citizen of the Uni|ted States, and &s;hould be protected as &s;uch, until he was prov|ed a de&s;erter from, or a &s;ubject of Great-Britain. If the cap|tain of an American frigate &s;hould take it into his head to pre&s;s into our &s;ervice the crew of an Engli&s;h merchatman, merely becau&s;e they &s;poke Engli&s;h, and looked like Ameri|cans, would Great-Britain &s;ubmit to the indignity? but if our flag is not to protect them, where is the difficulty of each man being furni&s;hed with a certificate of his birth or citizen|&s;hip, authenticated according to a pre&s;cribed form? No, &s;ays Camillus, who has always an an&s;wer ready, when Great-Britain is to be exculpated, this mode is liable to deception, and therefore cannot be relied on. Truly, &s;ir! your ingenui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a&s;toni&s;hes me. Becau&s;e, now and then, an impo&s;ition may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> practi&s;ed; becau&s;e a perjury may &s;ometimes be committed all our mariners are to be at the mercy of Great-Britain. Why not be explicit, and tell the truth at once. Great-Britain find|ing it very convenient to man her navy with our &s;eamen, and her national &s;afety being at &s;take, in&s;i&s;ts upon, and will exer|ci&s;e, the right of taking them wherever &s;he find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. She would not, therefore, con&s;ent to ab&s;tain from a practice which &s;he well knows we dare not to re&s;ent. Our mini&s;ter would have acted with becoming dignity, if he had broke off the negociation, until &s;he had con&s;ented to an article of more importance to this country than all the others put together, and which would have made &s;ome amends for the innume|rable advantages which Great-Britain derives from the treaty. The rights and &s;ecurity of the&s;e much-injured and u&s;eful men have been mo&s;t wantonly abandoned: nor do they alone feel the effects of this abominable &s;pecies of dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dations.

<PB N="101" REF="028389_0677_0FD8BEA7189A5700">the whole in&s;trument, which, as they affect America, have been dictated by either of tho&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Another part of the rea&s;oning of Camillus mu&s;t not be overlooked. "Our right to an exemption," &s;ays he, "is per|fect by the laws of nations; and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great-Britain." It were to be wi&s;hed that Great-Britain would re&s;t contented with a bare <HI>preten&s;ion</HI> to this right. Unfortunately, &s;he exerci&s;es it every day; and thou|&s;ands of our fellow-citizens, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>exemption</HI> to which they are entitled, are dragged from their own ve&s;&s;els into a &s;ervice which they execrate. If the laws of nations &s;e|cure us an exemption, where could be the harm of a de|claratory article to that effect? Other parts of the treaty, when again&s;t America, have been ju&s;tified by &s;ome, and pro|bably will be by Camillus, becau&s;e of their conformity to the laws of nations. Thus it has been &s;aid, and no doubt will be repeated, that by tho&s;e laws, free ve&s;&s;els do not make free goods, and that therefore, mr. Jay yielded nothing, when he con&s;ent|ed to an article of that kind. Why then &s;hould not Great-Britain humour us in our turn? If mr. Jay is ju&s;tifiable for doing us a greater injury with one &s;troke of his pen, than he can repair if he lives to the age of Methu&s;alem, becau&s;e the law of nations was on his &s;ide, why not expect, any, in|&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ame complai&s;ance from Great-Britain? to what incon&s;i&s;tencies and &s;hifts are &s;en&s;ible men driven, when they vindicate a bad cau&s;e! to what an abject &s;tate, my country|men, are you reduced! Great-Britain is become &s;ole arbiter of your rights, and the men whom you have loaded with ho|nors and offices, and who for years have drawn all their &s;up|port from your coffers, and who ought in gratitude to defend you, not only con&s;ent to &s;urrender your per&s;ons and liberties, but in&s;ult your under&s;tandings by an attempt to make you be|lieve that they have &s;tudied your true intere&s;ts in &s;o doing&mdash; God forbid! that &s;ome dark and wicked project &s;hould lurk behind all this my&s;terious conduct. Time alone can di&s;cover, why Americans are to be dragooned ju&s;t at this time, at the evident hazard of a rupture with France, into this new and di&s;|graceful connection. Events, yet in the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of time, mu&s;t develope whether Great-Britain has promi&s;ed any, and what aid to a certain party, in the attempts it may make, to &s;trengthen the government, and give it, as it is mode&s;tly called, a little more energy. In the mean while, let us be vigilant, and we &s;hall defeat every attempt upon our independence, and cover

<P>We are now arrived with Camillus at the fir&s;t article of the treaty. The way has been tedious and di&s;agreeable. He has told us, out of <HI>pure patrioti&s;m,</HI> many unpalatable <HI>truths.</HI> Thank God, notwith&s;tanding all his pains and eloquence (for even his enemies mu&s;t allow him to write well) my former good opinion of my country is un&s;haken. Her conduct with re&s;pect to Great-Britain will bear the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny. She has, indeed, been more finned again&s;t than finning. If I am mi&s;taken, the delu&s;ion is plea&s;ant, and I hope Camillus will not think me ob&s;tinate, when he is a&s;&s;ured, that hitherto I have not di&s;covered the &s;trength of any ground he has thought proper to take.</P>
<P>In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t article, Camillus encounters an ob|jection, &s;tated by the Charle&s;ton committee. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, there does not appear to be much force in the objec|tion, and yet, as &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were pro&s;cribed during the war, it may be a doubt whether tho&s;e of that de&s;cription will not be permitted to return under the treaty. It was, at any rate, hardly worth while to find fault with this article, and perhaps &s;omewhat puerile in Camillus to take &s;o much trou|ble, &s;eriou&s;ly to combat, what the objectors them&s;elves could not have laid much &s;tre&s;s on. The committee had, perhaps, di&s;covered &s;o many faults in the other articles, they thought it impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here &s;hould be an innocent one in the whole treaty, whatever its appearance might be.</P>

<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That as the power of finally making and ratifying treaties by the pre&s;ident and two-thirds of the &s;enate alone, has, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, been proved to be of a mo&s;t alarming|ly dangerous nature; that our very exi&s;tence as a free people, had been put at &s;take; that had not a good providence influen|ced even the <HI>twenty</HI> of the &s;enate to reject <HI>one</HI> article, which, <HI>from nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> mu&s;t arre&s;t the hand of the pre&s;ident from &s;ign|ing it, we &s;ay, that had not the providential care, which we have &s;o often experienced, interpo&s;ed, we had been a lo&s;t, an undone people, without pity, and without friends!</P>

<HEAD><HI>Some ob&s;ervations on a letter &s;aid to be written by a gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> character and information in Vermont, and bearing date the</HI> 18th <HI>July la&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FROM THE MINERVA.
<P>The following is an authentic extract of a letter from a gentleman of cha|racter and information in Vermont; for the truth of which we pledge our|&s;elves. It comes from a man of &s;eventy-&s;ix, and is dated July 18. 1795.</P>
<P>"The treaty of peace has now become a general &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, but is not as yet enough known to form the public mind. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the madmen in politics to communicate their madne&s;s to the &s;ub&s;tantial and numerous body of country farmers. They do not reverence the cu&s;toms, man|ners, or violent party, inflammatory writings of your zealous political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|natics. And while tho&s;e kind of writers plea&s;e them&s;elves with the conceit that they are enlightening the age and the world, they have no idea in what contempt their productions are viewed in the country. In &s;entiment and in|formation, they are below the under&s;tanding of every country farmer; and the declamatory, violent &s;tile &s;inks them &s;till lower, in rural e&s;timation. We are apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome of the large cities will endeavour to &s;et their mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in motion, with a view to dictate to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. Be a&s;&s;ured we will reject the federal union, before we will be governed in the country, by the mobs of Philadelphia, New-York, or Bo&s;ton. Moderation, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would be an error;&mdash;and the moment your mobs are &s;et agoing, you e&s;tab|li&s;h a di&s;tinction between town and country, which you will not ea&s;ily get rid of. The greate&s;t and wor&s;t of all political events that the country would &s;uf|fer, would be to have the government of it, under the direction of &s;uch tumul|tuous, outrageous, lawle&s;s a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>"The above is to carry to you &s;ome idea of the horror we entertain of a mob-government. Be &s;o good as to remember the articles of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not venture to a&s;certain what was the real view of the letter writer; he is, at all events, very wroth with the citizens of great cities, principally, as it appears to me becau&s;e he &s;u&s;pects they will dare to intermeddle in poli|tics, without obtaining his permi&s;&s;ions or at lea&s;t without being on his &s;ide. It is impo&s;&s;ible, however, to avoid ob&s;erving
<PB N="115" REF="028389_0691_0FD8EE32CA2A4F68">that without his knowing what had really happened in the&s;e cities, the obvious errors in the treaty are &s;o con&s;picuous, and, in contradiction to his will, obtrude them&s;elves &s;o forcibly on his brain, as to compel on his mind a &s;u&s;picion, that mobs will be rai&s;ed, while his with appears clearly to be, that no oppo&s;i|tion &s;hould be made again&s;t its obtaining the pre&s;ident's &s;igna|ture; &s;hould even its commercial errors be ruinous to the trade, and its political errors de&s;tructive to the liberties and peace of this country.</P>
<P>I know the people of Vermont well&mdash;they are quite good citizens; but they are likewi&s;e firm and inflexible patriots.</P>
<P>They know the value of their rights, and they will, if nece&s;|&s;ary, maintain them at every ri&s;que.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t, therefore, make a few ob&s;ervations on &s;uch parts of this extraordinary in&s;trument, as appears to me mo&s;t evidently wrong, and mo&s;t pointedly demon&s;trative, that ei|ther the head or the heart of the man who framed it, was ill calculated for executing the high tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, a&s;&s;ign &s;ome rea&s;ons why the people of Ver|mont, as well as of other parts of this extended country, will pur&s;ue every con&s;titutional method in then power, to prevent its becoming the &s;upreme law of the land.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article is, in my opinion, an indelible &s;tain up|on the honour and dignity of the nation; for, by agreeing that the po&s;ts &s;hall not be delivered up till the fir&s;t of June 1796, without any &s;tronger obligation on the part of the Bri|ti&s;h for the &s;urrender of them at that period, than we had at the treaty of peace, it is tacitly agreed, that the unju&s;t reten|tion of them was no infraction of that treaty.</P>
<P>Where was that genius of America, which governed its councils at the termination of the war? who, in a firm and manly tone, told this haughty and imperious government of Great-Britain, that, "we will not &s;peak on the &s;ubject of peace till you have fir&s;t acknowledged our independence."</P>
<P>Or are our pre&s;ent claims to the&s;e po&s;ts, after being ab&s;olute|ly ceded to us by a former treaty, made with that very govern|ment, le&s;s valid or le&s;s conclu&s;ive, than a claim to that inde|pendence which we then, in &s;uch unqualified terms, declared, &s;hould actually form the ba&s;is of the treaty? No, but our <HI>then</HI> mini&s;ters were different men, and had very different views from what <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them have at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If the third article is con&s;trued <HI>literally,</HI> it certainly does not provide for a <HI>free</HI> trade between Vermont and Canada, by the way of Lake Champlain. The words are, "but it is under|&s;tood
<PB N="116" REF="028389_0692_0FD8EE39293DADA0">that this article does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;|&s;els of the United States, into the &s;ea-ports, harbours, bays or creeks of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories; nor into &s;uch parts of the rivers in his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories, as are between the mouth thereof <HI>and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea,</HI> except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, trading <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Que|bec."</P>
<P>St. John's, at the bottom of Lake Champlain, is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, a Briti&s;h port of entry, where the American ve&s;&s;els, as well as all craft from Canada, for any part of that Lake, have entered and cleared out, ever &s;ince the peace; the Ver|mont trade, therefore, by this u&s;eful lake, mu&s;t, on a rigorous con&s;truction of that article, &s;top at that port.</P>
<P>How far the people of that &s;tate may e&s;teem them&s;elves obliged to mr. Jay, for leaving &s;o beneficial a branch of their trade, &s;ubject to &s;uch an indefinite, uncertain con&s;truction, I will not &s;ay.</P>
<P>The actual evil which may ari&s;e from the ninth article, de|pends in a great degree, upon the quantity of land now held by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. If, as is &s;aid by many, they at this moment hold &s;everal millions of acres, the pre&s;ent proprietors may, ei|ther on their lea&s;e or &s;ale thereof, to actual &s;ettlers, make it a condition, <HI>that they &s;hall remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects;</HI> in this ca&s;e, a &s;hort time would probably di&s;cover the benefits which would accrue <HI>from having one or two millions of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects actual &s;ettlers on our frontiers,</HI> who, the treaty declares, "&s;hall not, as far as may re&s;pect the &s;aid lands, and the legal remedies in|cident thereto, be regarded as aliens;" a due attention to the twenty-&s;ixth article of the treaty, will po&s;&s;ibly enable many good republicans to di&s;cover mr. Jay's real intentions; for even <HI>in ca&s;e of war,</HI> though they &s;hall remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, they cannot be compelled to quit the country as long "as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence again&s;t the laws." Many of us remember the di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;uffered by the patriots of this country la&s;t war, by only a few of &s;uch men being among&s;t us. It was be&s;t, perhaps, not to have the&s;e two arti|cles of the treaty too near each other.</P>
<P>But I would a&s;k "the gentleman of character and infor|mation in Vermont," by what part of the con&s;titution of the United States, congre&s;s at large, <HI>much le&s;s the &s;enate and pre&s;i|dent,</HI> have the power of declaring that <HI>aliens</HI> &s;hall, <HI>in any in|&s;tance,</HI> have a right to hold lands within any one &s;tate?</P>
<P>I am &s;afe in averring, that each &s;tate has hitherto claime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> priviledge of granting or prohibiting that right.</P>
<P>And the third &s;ection of the fourth article of the con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="117" REF="028389_0693_0FD8EE3A44E1A240">after granting to congre&s;s, "power to di&s;po&s;e of and make all needful rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territo|ry or other property <HI>belonging to the United States,</HI>" explicitly declares, that "nothing in this con&s;titution &s;hall be &s;o con&s;tru|ed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, <HI>or of any particular &s;tate.</HI>"</P>
<P>Does the letter writer imagine, that the people of Vermont, becau&s;e they are known to be truly federal, will tamely &s;ubmit to &s;ee their &s;tate deprived of a privilege &s;o important and ex|ten&s;ive, and &s;o pointedly guarded to them by the con&s;titution of the United States, without ever remon&s;trating again&s;t it?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to heavens that the letter writer was the only man in America, who would &s;acrifice the rights of <HI>his &s;tate,</HI> to the pre|dominancy of <HI>his party.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth article, which declares, that "neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to the individuals of another, nor &s;hares, nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war, or national differences, be &s;eque&s;tered or con|fi&s;cated," carries, I readily acknowledge, the <HI>appearance</HI> of honor and hone&s;ty, on the very face of it; but unfortunately in mak|ing the di&s;tribution of the con&s;equences of that &s;tipulation, en|tered into between the contracting parties, all the benefits ari&s;|ing therefrom go to the &s;ide of the Briti&s;h only, and all the di&s;advantages to the &s;ide of this country; we having &s;carce any money in their funds, or any debts due by them to us; while they have immen&s;e &s;ums under our controul, which ought to have been maintained in that &s;ituation, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of being a preventative again&s;t &s;uch a predatory, di&s;graceful warfare, as they have waged again&s;t us, <HI>with impunity,</HI> for up|wards of two years.</P>
<P>Fat am I from thinking, that either a &s;eque&s;tration or con|fi&s;cation ought to take place on any &s;light or frivolous occa&s;ion. May the honor and integrity of the United States become proverbial throughout the habitable world.</P>
<P>To explain my&s;elf by a homely, but I think, &s;triking &s;imile, I will &s;uppo&s;e that our friend, mr.&mdash;, who is a man twice as &s;trong as I am, had frequently met me in the high|way, and had &s;ometimes &s;everely drubbed me, at other times, had thrown me in the mud, and ruined my clothes; that I had made frequent remon&s;trances again&s;t this ill treatment, but in vain, having, to all my mild remon&s;trances, and humiliating petitions, received from him, nothing but vindictive, and &s;uperci|lious replies; that at la&s;t I loaded a pi&s;tol of his, which happen|ed
<PB N="118" REF="028389_0694_0FD8EE3C8CE6FE68">to be in my hou&s;e, put it into my pocket, and threatened to blow his brains out the next time he ever attacked me on the highway; that I then &s;ent a friend, on who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and integrity I &s;trongly relied, for the purpo&s;e of adopting &s;ome mode for terminating all our di&s;putes.</P>
<P>That this friend, after having &s;ettled on terms in many re|&s;pects very favourable to mr.&mdash;, &s;tipulated, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner, that, though it was profitable and convenient for him &s;till to leave his pi&s;tol with me, I &s;hould never attempt to u&s;e it in my own defence again&s;t him, even to &s;ave my own life, notwith&s;tanding a future attack, on his part, &s;hould be equally violent, virulent, and unprovoked, as tho&s;e which he had formerly made on me, my friend obtaining at the &s;ame time, a promi&s;e from mr.&mdash;, equally obligatory on him, that he would never u&s;e again&s;t me, a little popgun, which my friend very well knew could not po&s;&s;ibly injure me more than by taking a button off my coat.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, ought I to retain a good opinion of either my friend or of any other per&s;on who advi&s;ed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mea&s;ure? I he&s;itate not to an&s;wer that I never would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the lea&s;t con&s;idence in him again, but &s;hould ever look upon him, and them, with a jealous eye, as men, who, from &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter and wicked motives, were meditating my de&s;truction e&s;pecially as they were perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that both my inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> and inclination would prevent me from ever beginning an attack upon him, or even from intentionally giving him offence.</P>
<P>The 17th article declares, that the goods of an enemy to Great-Britain, found on board any of our ve&s;&s;els, &s;hall be made prize of.</P>
<P>This, it is admitted, is agreeable to the common law of na|tions, as that law formerly &s;tood; for Vatel &s;ays, page 507, that "effects, belonging to an enemy, found on board a neu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;hip, are &s;eizable by the rights of war; but, by the law of na|ture, the ma&s;ter is to be paid his freight, and not to &s;uffer by the &s;eizure."</P>
<P>Mr. Jay carefully adhered to the fir&s;t part of this maxim. It is certainly very favourable to the Briti&s;h. The &s;econd part, which re&s;pects the payment of the freight, is neglected: it cer|tainly would have been very favourable to the people of the United States.</P>
<P>But, when our worthy pre&s;ident i&s;&s;ued his proclamation of neutrality, he predicated it upon the modern law of nations: an adherence to which would have prevented our mini&s;ter
<PB N="119" REF="028389_0695_0FD8EE401C652270">from entering into a po&s;itive &s;tipulation for &s;uch an ignomi|nious conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The twenty-third article of our treaty with France, the tenth with Holland, the &s;eventh with Sweden, the twelfth with Pru&s;&s;ia, and the third with the emperor of Morocco, all re|&s;pectively &s;tipulate, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, though the&s;e goods &s;hould belong to the enemy of either of tho&s;e nations. Though I am not a mer|chant, common &s;en&s;e points out to me, on the fir&s;t blu&s;h, the ex|ten&s;ive advantages which mu&s;t have accrued to our carrying-trade, by an adherence to the &s;ame plan in our pre&s;ent treaty with Great-Britain. Did the recollection of the innumerable favours which Great-Britain has heaped on us from the nineteenth April, 1775, to the very moment at which he &s;ign|ed the treaty, overwhelm our amba&s;&s;ador with neck-loads of gratitude, that he forgot that this article was diametrically op|po&s;ite to our &s;tipulation with every other nation with whom we had a treaty?</P>
<P>I do not mean, that our other treaties precluded him from the right of entering into this &s;tipulation. I only wi&s;h to &s;how, that, while France and other friendly nations had voluntarily granted to us this ine&s;timable privilege in our very indigent days, our amba&s;&s;ador, though to the highe&s;t prejudice of that nation, meanly and cringingly ceded it to Great-Britain, in the height of our pro&s;perity! Or did he imagine it would plea&s;e his countrymen, to proclaim to the world, that, like true &s;paniels, they fawned mo&s;t on tho&s;e from whom they had the &s;evere&s;t whippings?</P>
<P>I feel for the honor of my country, and pray to my God, that, though &s;he is fallen, it may not be for ever.</P>
<P>But perhaps this part of the treaty, as well as &s;everal other parts, were entered into for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the French nation, and thereby occa&s;ioning a rupture between them and us. If this was really mr. Jay's policy, I think it is far from being improbable, that we may &s;oon reap the fruits of his labour, by fully experiencing the good or bad effects thereof.</P>
<P>The eighteenth article, regulating what is in future to be deemed contraband, is &s;o &s;uperlatively humiliating and degrad|ing to our&s;elves; &s;o plainly and unequivocally levelled again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of our ally, that even Camillus finds him&s;elf com|pelled to make a wayward apology for it.</P>
<P>Poor Camillus, thou wa&s;t then driven to thy la&s;t &s;hift in|deed, and heaven knows that thou art po&s;&s;e&s;t of more of them
<PB N="120" REF="028389_0696_0FD8EE41C365ACB8">in the defence of a bad cau&s;e, than any man of thy country was ever before.</P>
<P>In this, as in the former article, our <HI>extraordinary amba&s;&s;a|dor</HI> has &s;tipulated, that naval &s;tores, &amp;c. &s;hall be deemed con|traband, and liable to capture; though it will appear by the twenty-fourth article of our treaty with France, the twenty-fourth with Holland, the tenth with Sweden, the thirteenth with Pru&s;|&s;ia, and the third with the emperor of Morocco, that we have contracted, that they &s;hall not be contraband. Nay, what as far as is po&s;&s;ible, adds to the di&s;grace of this part of the treaty, even Great-Britain her&s;elf, in her commercial treaty, with France, declares that they &s;hall not be contraband.</P>
<P>What opinion our ally will entertain of our friend&s;hip for her&mdash;what opinion the world at large will entertain of our mag|nanimity, good faith, and gratitude as a nation, and in what de|gree of e&s;timation our mini&s;ter will be held by his fellow citi|zens at &s;ome future period, time only can fully unravel.</P>
<P>If even the extacy of joy, upon being permitted the honor of ki&s;&s;ing the queen's hand, was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as to obliterate from his mind, that cotton was a branch of the produce of his coun|try, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that the plea&s;ure conti|nued &s;o extremely ravi&s;hing during the whole negociation, as to make him forget that there were two &s;uch &s;tates as <HI>Virgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> a great proportion of who&s;e trade, by this &s;hameful conce&s;&s;ion, he was &s;acrificing at the &s;hrine of them bittere&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t article defines what piracy is, and deter|mines what the puni&s;hment thereof &s;hall be, by &s;aying, "that if any &s;ubject or citizen of the &s;aid parties re&s;pectively, &s;hall accept any foreign commi&s;&s;ion or letters of marque, for arming any ve&s;&s;el to act as a privateer again&s;t the other party, and be taken by the other party, it is hereby declared to be lawful <HI>for the &s;aid party,</HI> to treat and puni&s;h the &s;aid &s;ubject or citizen, having &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion, or letters of marque, <HI>as a pirate.</HI>"</P>
<P>The eighth &s;ection of the con&s;titution of the United States, declares, that "congre&s;s &s;hall have the power to <HI>define and puni&s;h piracies</HI> and felonies committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations."</P>
<P>The cur&s;e of oblivion &s;eems to have pervaded our mini&s;ter's brain in every part of this treaty, which did not embrace &s;ome point favourable to the Briti&s;h; for here again, he has forgot that the <HI>hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives</HI> are an ab&s;olute (though in his opinion, probably a very trifling) part of congre&s;s; and as <HI>they</HI> were not to be con&s;ulted about the propriety or impropriety of
<PB N="121" REF="028389_0697_0FD8EE4408A09A58">this treaty, he ought to have &s;een that he was entering into an agreement which the &s;enate could not approve of, nor the pre|&s;ident ratify, without a palpable breach of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But for argument's &s;ake, I will for a moment &s;uppo&s;e it con|&s;titutional, and I will likewi&s;e acknowledge, that by the twen|ty-fir&s;t article of our treaty with France, the nineteenth with Holland, and the twenty-third with Sweden, the &s;ame crime was by our then congre&s;s <HI>(not by a part of it)</HI> deemed a piracy; but mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, in&s;i&s;t, that the manner of puni&s;hment is de&s;cribed in a very different way. In each of the&s;e treaties the words are the&s;e, "and if any per&s;on of either nation &s;hall take &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions or letters of marque, <HI>he &s;hall be puni&s;hed at a pirate."</HI></P>
<P>In our treaties with Pru&s;&s;ia and the emperor of Morocco, it is &s;tipulated, that "&s;ubjects, nor citizens of either party, &s;hall take commi&s;&s;ions from any power with whom either of the contracting parties may be at war;" but no puni&s;hment whate|ver is affixed to the breach of that article.</P>
<P>By our treaty, then, on this head, with the fir&s;t three nations above mentioned, the offender again&s;t the article was. I con|ceive, upon complaint made, or information lodged, to be tried, as the con&s;titution directs, by a jury of his countrymen con&s;picuous for their moderation, lenity and ju&s;tice; and, if &s;trong extenuating circum&s;tances appeared in his favour, &s;hould even the jury e&s;teem them&s;elves obliged to condemn him, agreeable to the letter of the law, they might, neverthele&s;s, for|cibly recommend him to that branch of the government, in who&s;e hands the plea&s;ing power of &s;howing mercy is &s;o wi&s;ely placed.</P>
<P>As no puni&s;hment is annexed to the crime by our treaty with the other two powers, the offender mu&s;t have been trie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon common principles.</P>
<P>Mr. Jay has the honour of being the fir&s;t American mini&s;ter, who ever had the courage by public act, to declare, in expre&s;s terms, that his fellow-citizens are liable to be condemned as pirates, by a Briti&s;h court of admiralty, for an act of which the law of nations renders even the criminality doubtful.</P>
<P>What does he really &s;ay on this head of the treaty? Exer|ci&s;ing his mo&s;t inventive talents to enrage his fellow-citizens to &s;ome improper uncon&s;titutional act, he virtually tells them, I &s;ee that you &s;till remain equally attached to, equally ena|moured with the principles of liberty, as you did when I was a <HI>pacific</HI> bellower in that cau&s;e, and therefore, that your attach|ment to the French nation, in her pre&s;ent conte&s;t, may lead &s;ome
<PB N="122" REF="028389_0698_0FD8EE45852083E8">of you to engage as volunteers in her &s;ervice, depending upon that principle in the laws of nations, declared by Vatel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 594, in the following words, "volunteers taken by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are treated as if part of the army in which they fight." No|thing can be more rea&s;onable. They, in fact, unite them&s;elves this army. They &s;upport the &s;ame cau&s;e, no matter whether it be from obligation or free will.</P>
<P>But, continues Mr. Jay, I will ri&s;k deviating materially from the words of every treaty hitherto entered into by the United States, &s;hould my act even be an uncon&s;titutional one, and de|clare that, if fighting in this cau&s;e you are taken by the Engli&s;h, it &s;hall be in their power to hang you as pirates.</P>
<P>Gracious God! ye heroes who were the glorious copartne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the brave little French army at the &s;iege of York-Town, and &s;hared with them the honor of fighting, bleeding and conq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing in the cau&s;e of freedom! can you believe, that your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> commander in chief will ever give his &s;anction to &s;uch as all as this?

<P>Surely our mini&s;ter might at lea&s;t have permitted this part of the treaty to have &s;tood on the exi&s;ting principles of the law of nations, without &s;anctifying a Briti&s;h right in the plunder of our ally's property, and the de&s;truction of almo&s;t beneficial part of our own trade.</P>

The eighteenth article, which permits naval &s;tores, &amp;c. to be deemed contraband, <HI>though all our other treaties ex|pre&s;sly &s;tipulate that they &s;hall</HI> NOT <HI>be deemed contraband,</HI> meets with a much more &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, than it could po&s;&s;ibly receive from any ob&s;ervation of mine, through the pen of the partial, and; probably well-paid Camillus, who admits, "that it is the <HI>mo&s;t indefen&s;ible</HI> part of the treaty."</P>
<P N="7">7th.

<P>Having now pointed out, from the army, a few of the mo&s;t glaring execptionable features of the treaty, the well known children of our mini&s;ter, by the actual &s;in of commi&s;&s;ion, I will next endeavour to exhibit &s;ome of tho&s;e, which art equal|ly di&s;tingui&s;hable, but have aro&s;e from the &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion.</P>

But how much greater have the lo&s;&s;es and damages been to the United States by the detention of the po&s;ts! When we take into view all the con&s;equences of

<P>I will at the &s;ame time confe&s;s, that if mr. Jay is equally careful of the per&s;on of the <HI>pre&s;ent governor</HI> of this &s;tate, [New-York] as he was of his own at the time E&s;opus was burnt, by the marauding army of his favourite nation, there is no ri&s;k that his excellency will &s;uffer from this neglect, as he will not become a pri&s;oner till the Briti&s;h reach the mountains of Kent. A de&s;ire to obey his excellency's orders will produce an explanation of this, whenever he is plea&s;ed to require it.</P>
<P>I am aware, that it will be ob&s;erved, that as there were two parties to the treaty, it was impo&s;&s;ible for mr. Jay to ob|tain all he wi&s;hed&mdash;Granted&mdash;But, does it follow from thence, that in the humiliating manner he has done, we were to yield up to the ambitious and &s;upercilious arrogance of the other party, whatever &s;he, <HI>in the agonizing frenzy of departing great|ne&s;s,</HI> might think proper to require.</P>
<P>What opinion mu&s;t the other nations entertain of either our honor or independence, who&s;e treaties with us are demon|&s;trated to be &s;o much more in our favor, than the one mr. Jay has thought proper to &s;ubmit to?</P>
<P>We boa&s;t of our increa&s;e in wealth, in numbers, in re&s;pec|tability as a nation, all ari&s;ing from the good management of the political machine, by tho&s;e who have the pre&s;ent direction thereof: and yet this treaty mu&s;t give the lie direct to that a&s;|&s;ertion in the opinion of every man, not intimately acquainted with our true &s;ituation; becau&s;e it abjectly crouches beneath the galling yoke of Great-Britain, and &s;ervilely grants to her what no other nation, in the hour of our greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>before we had even thrown off our &s;waddling bands,</HI> ever at|tempted to demand of us.</P>
<P>I will quit this fir&s;t part of my promi&s;e, and proceed to my &s;econd, by &s;howing &s;ome rea&s;ons, why the people in <HI>Vermont,</HI> as well as in other parts of this extended country, will pur&s;ue
<PB N="126" REF="028389_0702_0FD8EE4F4586CB80">every legal method in their power, to prevent its becoming the &s;upreme law of the land.</P>
<P>It is well known, that there has been, for many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> throughout the yeomanry of this country, a &s;ettled &s;pirit of enmity again&s;t the Briti&s;h government, ari&s;ing, among&s;t other cau&s;es, from the remembrance of their &s;avage and active cru|elties, during the la&s;t war, the hatred di&s;played to us during the peace, and their unparalleled depredations on our trade, &s;ince the commencement of their war with France.</P>
<P>And as this treaty entitles the people of that nation to rights and liberties within each &s;tate, which cannot be con&s;titution|ally granted but by the &s;tate it&s;elf; that part of the yeomanry who wi&s;h not to &s;ee the con&s;titution infringed on, or the power of their re&s;pective &s;tates fritter'd down to that of &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|porations, will univer&s;ally oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It is intended to di&s;unite us from our ally, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> yeomanry of this country get every day more and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tached; and they will therefore oppo&s;e it.</P>

<P>It was formed in contradiction to the expre&s;&s;ed wi&s;hes of their <HI>immediate</HI> repre&s;entatives in congre&s;s; and they will therefore oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>They will reflect, that the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies are dependa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on us for their very exi&s;tence, as is fully demon&s;trated by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|quent petitions of their inhabitants to the Briti&s;h parliament.

That had &s;he compelled us to war, our privateers would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her trade in a degree exceeding the bounds of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|lation; of which opinion, the number of Briti&s;h prizes brought into our ports la&s;t war, affords undeniable proof&mdash;and that is a very &s;hort time &s;he mu&s;t have lo&s;t all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent of North-America&mdash;That, under the&s;e con&s;iderations a wi&s;e, a firm, an hone&s;t mini&s;ter could not have failed it procuring us terms <HI>at lea&s;t reciprocally beneficial.</HI> And there|fore, they will oppo&s;e this heterogenous treaty, begot in the dark; and u&s;hered forth to public view, again&s;t the exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> will of its legitimate parents, who, con&s;cious of its deformi|ty, wi&s;hed to conceal it from the penetrating eye of their countrymen as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that twenty &s;enators having gives
<PB N="127" REF="028389_0703_0FD8EE535E97F860">their &s;anction to its adoption, <HI>is prima facie</HI> evidence that it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t excellent treaty&mdash;Granted.</P>
<P>And it will be an&s;wered, that ten &s;enators being warmly op|po&s;ed to it, and every <HI>tory</HI> in the country extolling it as the greate&s;t proof that heaven ever furni&s;hed, of its watchful at|tention over the honor, liberty, peace, pro&s;perity, welfare, and independence of the United States, is likewi&s;e <HI>prima facie</HI> evidence that it is a mo&s;t d&mdash;n&mdash;able treaty. And the &s;en&s;ible yeomanry of this country, after &s;ubtracting the one evidence from the other, and finding the balance greatly again&s;t the treaty, will therefore more firmly oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Many other arguments might be produced; but I &s;hall &s;top here, and a&s;&s;ign &s;ome additional rea&s;ons, why I am of opinion, that the yeomanry of <HI>Vermont</HI> will, in a particular manner, oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Their connection with Canada has given them frequent opportunities of viewing the &s;upercilious, haughty deport|ment of many of the Briti&s;h officers, to whom the etiquette of that government led them to make application; and they have ob&s;erved their deep-rooted contempt of republicani&s;m and republican manners. They will, therefore, oppo&s;e an <HI>intimacy</HI> of national connection.</P>
<P>That &s;tate has been &s;uperior to mo&s;t, and inferior to none, in point of <HI>federali&s;m;</HI> and they will, therefore, be delicately careful in preventing their darling con&s;titution from being, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, impaired or infringed on.</P>
<P>The citizens of that &s;tate, even their profe&s;&s;ional men of all de&s;criptions, are (&s;peaking generally) warm admirers of the French cau&s;e, though they do not attempt to ju&s;tify all their actions: and as many of the leading features of this treaty have a &s;trong tendency to di&s;tre&s;s that cau&s;e, they will oppo&s;e it with an energy, proportionate to their love of ration|al liberty, and of the rights of man.</P>
<P>But taking for granted, what the editor of the Minerva a&s;|&s;erts, that the unknown letter-writer in Vermont, is, "A gentleman of character and information," I will oppo&s;e his &s;entiments by tho&s;e of another citizen of that &s;tate, known by his writings and his pleadings to be <HI>really</HI> "a gentleman of character and information."&mdash;I mean judge Chipman, who, in the year 1793, previous to this bu&s;tle about French and Engli&s;h politics, wrote "&s;ketches on the principles of go|vernment," in which he exhibits maxims, perfectly con&s;o|nant with tho&s;e maintained by the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ers to the trea|ty, and equally repugnant to tho&s;e di&s;played by the learned
<PB N="128" REF="028389_0704_0FD8EE578BB18F90">letter writer, who&s;e principal aim, as far as he choo&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> explain him&s;elf, appears to be a &s;trong de&s;ire of proving, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it is improper for the people to inve&s;tigate the treaty, but to tru&s;t to the well-known abilities and integrity of the con&s;ti|tuted authorities&mdash;and in attempting this, his language is ex|tremely indecorous, and even indecent; indeed, he &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have borrowed much of his &s;tile from the editor of the Mi|nerva.</P>
<P>The letter-writer &s;ays, in great heat, "we are apprehen|&s;ive that &s;ome of the large cities will endeavour to &s;et their <HI>mobs</HI> in motion, with a view to dictate to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate.

<P>And does it comport with thy opinion of the people of the&s;e cities, mr. letter writer, that they cannot meet quietly and form re&s;olutions on a &s;ubject, not only of the utmo&s;t im|portance to them&s;elves, but their po&s;terity, without becoming rioters? Has your vanity, on being permitted to corre&s;pond <HI>with the editor of the Minerva,</HI> &s;o mi&s;led your under&s;tanding, as to make you &s;uppo&s;e the citizens of Vermont could be &s;o far duped as to believe, that a riotous mob, and a Bo&s;ton to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> meeting, were &s;ynonimous terms?</P>
<P>Are you &s;o extremely credulous, <HI>my little lord pompo&s;ity,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to imagine, that this, thy pigmy threat, "of &s;eparation from the federal government," will intimidate the freemen of Ver|mont, from &s;earching into the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent agitation of the public mind, which has taken place from the one end of this exten&s;ive continent to the other, or that it will deter them from giving their opinion thereon, in a firm, man|ly and decent manner?</P>
<P>Or do you believe, <HI>my little di&s;appointed &s;nipper-&s;napper,</HI> that the additional yelping of a half a dozen more &s;uch whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> as thy&s;elf, would meet the &s;ame attention and re&s;pect, as the &s;olid, &s;erious and patriotic advice given by your fellow-citizen, the judge?</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee then what he &s;ays:&mdash;</P>
<P>In page 77, he ob&s;erves, "that when we find an infringe|ment on the liberties of the people, <HI>admitted in the admini&s;tra|tion, we ought not to excu&s;e our&s;elves from &s;earching the cau&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame worthy patriot, in &s;howing the advantages which ari&s;e from the di&s;&s;emination of u&s;eful knowledge, in page 152, makes u&s;e of this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion: "let there be no re&s;traint on the liberty of the pre&s;s, <HI>no check upon</HI> PUBLIC
<PB N="129" REF="028389_0705_0FD8EE59C7F85438"><HI>or private di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,</HI> but what is impo&s;ed by the manners, morals, ta&s;te, and good &s;en&s;e of the age."</P>
<P>The&s;e two are the expre&s;s &s;entiments of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the treaty;&mdash;but, po&s;&s;ibly, <HI>my little wild politician,</HI> you will in&s;i&s;t that the judge meant to confine "public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion" to the country only; and yet I &s;u&s;pect, that it would bring a blu&s;h even into thy face, to be called on for a good argument to &s;how cau&s;e why the citizens of great mercantile cities &s;hould be prevented from "di&s;cu&s;&s;ing publicly," an in&s;tru|ment, chri&s;tened under the title of treaty of commerce and navigation.</P>
<P>Our letter writer is for tru&s;ting every thing to the con&s;titu|ted authorities.</P>
<P>The worthy judge on the other hand, in page 159, makes an ob&s;ervation which we can have no rea&s;on to doubt is &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the pre&s;ident's mind, in the pre&s;ent bu|&s;ine&s;s&mdash;"In the making of laws, a great regard mu&s;t be had to the circum&s;tances, manners, and <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of the people, as well as to the principles of the con&s;titution&mdash;the laws mu&s;t be the be&s;t which the people can bear."</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, after admitting this principle, that the pre&s;ident would ratify the pre&s;ent treaty, in contradiction to the &s;entiments of &s;o re&s;pectable and &s;o decided a majority of the people, is &s;uppo&s;ing that he would gratify his own in|clination, at the hazard of commotions, which would not only be extremely dangerous to the community, but would probably be attended with his own political de&s;truction. And, how could the pre&s;ident have known, that the people were &s;o univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed to this treaty, provided, as our letter writer &s;eems to wi&s;h, they had been perfectly &s;ilent on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Was this treaty to be ratified, I am well convinced that the citizens of Vermont would almo&s;t univer&s;ally oppo&s;e it, from a hearty concurrence with their worthy judge, in the follow|ing &s;entiment, for they cannot be ignorant, that this treaty is in direct oppo&s;ition to the expre&s;&s;ed will of the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives, who wi&s;hed to obtain ju&s;tice from Great-Britain, not by the fawning &s;lattery and cringing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a grovel|ing, pro&s;tituted mind, but by that calm, deliberate, but &s;tern firmne&s;s, in &s;upport of our natural rights, nece&s;&s;ary for main|taining that re&s;pect and attention which our &s;ituation, our growing greatne&s;s, and the exten&s;ive advantages of our trade and commerce gave us a right to claim from the nations of the world. Was, then, the pre&s;ident to give his &s;anction to this treaty, we &s;hould have the &s;enate in favour of, and the hou&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="028389_0706_0FD8EE59CAF9CC98">of repre&s;entatives, <HI>our be&s;t guardians,</HI> oppo&s;ed to, the in&s;tru|ment, which (if it is not uncon&s;titutional) would become <HI>the &s;u|preme law of the land.</HI></P>
<P>The citizens of Vermont, in that ca&s;e, would draw many of their arguments from the pure republican fountain which the judge has laid open to them, in page 140, where he &s;ays, "Public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and mature deliberation, in the making of laws, are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;The &s;enate and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hould have equal powers. <HI>No law &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> without the concurrence of both."</HI></P>
<P>Are we to &s;uppo&s;e, then, that the pre&s;ident will join the &s;e|nate in &s;anctioning a law, &s;uppo&s;ing it even con&s;titutional, which he knows to be repugnant to the wi&s;hes of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and nine-tenths of the people? Cur&s;ed be he who entertains &s;uch an opinion of him. Such an act would not be an error, it would be a crime.</P>
<P>I may, however, be po&s;&s;ibly a&s;ked&mdash;Should the pre&s;ident think him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in ratifying the treaty, ought not the people to re&s;t contented, and view it as the &s;upreme law of the land? I he&s;itate not to an&s;wer, <HI>They ought not.</HI></P>
<P>It will then be their duty to convoke town-meetings, and petition their <HI>immediate</HI> repre&s;entatives in congre&s;s to declare, whether the privileges of that hou&s;e have not been gro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in|fringed on? Whether, in certain parts of that treaty, the &s;e|nate have not exceeded their con&s;titutional powers?</P>
<P>For I perfectly agree with the learned judge, whom I have &s;o often quoted, in his opinion, page 117, "That the govern|ment, that is, tho&s;e organized bodies who are entru&s;ted with the powers of government, <HI>are bound by the con&s;titution, but have no power in them&s;elves, to make, alter or controul any of its laws.</HI>"</P>
<P>And it appears to me very clear, that the power granted to the pre&s;ident, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of two-thirds of the &s;enate pre&s;ent, <HI>to make treaties,</HI> could never, by the framers of the con&s;titution, have been intended to controul tho&s;e important and exten&s;ive rights, entru&s;ted to congre&s;s at large, in two precedent clau&s;es of that &s;ame con&s;titution, viz. "The powers of regulating commerce with foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tions," and "of defining and puni&s;hing piracies," which powers are granted in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, and not, there|fore, to yield to mere implication, e&s;pecially when the admi&s;|&s;ion of that implication would be contradictory to the gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was intended to authorize eleven members of the &s;enate, with the pre&s;ident, legally to re|gulate
<PB N="131" REF="028389_0707_0FD8EE5B4A7B8090">the commerce of &s;uch an exten&s;ive mereantile country as this, and that their regulation was to be binding on the peo|ple, without a po&s;&s;ibility of con&s;titutional redre&s;s, however di&s;|agreeable it might be to them, to the majority of the &s;enate, and to the whole hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives? And yet this might happen, if the power of making treaties embraces all the ob|jects our pre&s;ent treaty makers wi&s;h. For the power is granted to the pre&s;ident, and two-thirds of the &s;enators <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI> As the &s;enate con&s;i&s;ts of only thirty members, and as it is provided by the con&s;titution, that a majority of them &s;hall form a quorum, it is in the power of &s;ixteen members to conclude a treaty; and as eleven members make more than two-thirds of tho&s;e &s;ixteen, they, with the pre&s;ident, would fully be empowered, by the con&s;titution, to have formed the pre&s;ent pending treaty, momentous as it is, in contradiction to the wi&s;hes, <HI>informally</HI> declared, though in the mo&s;t decided terms, of nineteen &s;ena|tors, the whole hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and the whole of the people.</P>
<P>I again a&s;k, is it po&s;&s;ible our con&s;titution could have intend|ed to clothe any twelve men with &s;uch immen&s;e, &s;uch uncon|troulable, &s;uch irrevocable powers?</P>
<P>But I hear &s;ome people &s;ay&mdash;Should the pre&s;ident ratify this treaty, and &s;hould the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, regardle&s;s of the petition of the people, permit it to re&s;t on its pre&s;ent foot|ing, unnoticed by them, what are the people to do in that ca&s;e?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, we &s;hould be placed, not only in a difficult, but a very di&s;mal &s;ituation: It would be the cri&s;is for determining, whether the term, <HI>maje&s;ty of the people,</HI> was, like the children's rattle, u&s;ed merely to keep them from murmuring and complaining; or whether, in this land of liberty, it had an ab&s;olute and real exi&s;tence, calcula|ted for much more important purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>But it is improper even to &s;uppo&s;e, what there is &s;o little probability of ever experiencing; for I again repeat, that the pre&s;ident never will give his &s;anction to an irrevocable act, which he has the mo&s;t convincing proofs of the great body of his fellow citizens viewing with hatred, horror, and contempt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with calling heaven to witne&s;s, that no man more fervently wi&s;hes than I do, to &s;ee the citizens of the United States unanimous in their obedience to the laws of the land, as long as tho&s;e laws are founded on the immutable prin|ciples of ju&s;tice, good &s;aith, and national honor.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following important ca&s;e of the Brigantine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bet&s;ey, W. Furlong, ma&s;ter, was heard and determined in London, by the lords com|mi&s;&s;ioners of appeals, on the twenty-fifth July, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the &s;hip's papers and depo&s;itions of the captain and crew, produced in evidence on this cau&s;e, it appears that the brigantine Bet&s;ey, belonging wholly to mr. George Patter|&s;on, of Baltimore, cleared out from that port on the nineteenth December, 1793, for the i&s;land of St. Bartholomew's and a market. That inque&s;t of a market &s;he went directly to Guadaloupe, where &s;he arrived on the eighth of January following. Here &s;he di&s;charged her cargo of provi&s;ions, and took in one of We&s;t-India produce. With this cargo &s;he was proceeding to Balti|more, when &s;he was met, and captured by the privateer &s;loop of war, Agenoria, Willis Morgan, commander and taken in|to Bermuda.</P>
<P>Her cargo con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ugar, coffee, and other goods, be|longing, in certain &s;pecified proportions, to the captain William Furlong, and to me&s;&s;rs. George and William Patter&s;on.</P>
<P>On the fourth of April, 1794, proceedings on behalf of the captors were commenced. On the twenty-third of April fol|lowing, the ve&s;&s;el was claimed by captain Furlong, on behalf of mr. George Patter&s;on, and the cargo on behalf of him&s;elf, a citizen of the United States, and of me&s;&s;rs. George and William Patter&s;on, both al&s;o lawful citizens of the United States, and who had been for many years before re&s;ident in Baltimore, in the &s;tate of Maryland, where their families and hou&s;es of trade were. Mr. George Patter&s;on has been alleg|ed to be a native of Ireland&mdash;there is &s;ome doubt as to this fact&mdash;it is not contended, however, but that he was actually a citizen of the United States. It appears that he went over to Gua|daloupe for a &s;pecial purpo&s;e, as the agent of his brother, and not with the view of re&s;iding there&mdash;on the contrary, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> propo&s;ed returning without delay to Baltimore, as his place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t of May, 1794, the cau&s;e was brought on for a hearing, before John Green, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> judge of the vice ad|miralty court of Bermuda; and on the twenty-third of &s;aid month, the ve&s;&s;el with her "boat, tackle, apparel and furni|ture, and all and &s;ingular her cargo and lading, were adjudged and condemned as lawful prize to the captors by the &s;aid judge:
<PB N="133" REF="028389_0709_0FD8EE6261B418F8">and the claimant, captain Furlong, ordered and directed to pay the taxed co&s;ts of &s;uit."</P>
<P>The true ground of judge Green's decree appears to have been, according to his own words, becau&s;e "&s;he had come im|mediately from a French port, declared by authority to have been blockaded by his Britannic maje&s;ty's fleets and armies." It &s;eems the "authority" that "declared" the French i&s;lands in a &s;tate of blockade, was admiral &s;ir J. Jervis; and the evi|dence of this act before the court was a copy of a letter from this officer, to Thomas Griffith, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Barbadoes, of which the following is an exact tran&s;cript:</P>

<P>THE ve&s;&s;el and cargo condemned, on the twenty-third of April, were delivered to the captors by order of the judge, at an apprai&s;ement of four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety-eight pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings and &s;even-pence, Bermuda currency; which is &s;tated to have been far below the actual value of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el and cargo.</P>
<P>An appeal was immediately entered from this &s;entence, and the claimants prayed the re&s;titution of their property, for the following rea&s;on, a&s;&s;igned by their coun&s;el, &s;ir William and &s;ir John Scott.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e the &s;hip and cargo were clearly and indubitably the property of American &s;ubjects, engaged in a fair and licit trade."</P>

<P>"Becau&s;e the &s;ole owner of the &s;hip and cargo, was at the time of the capture, an inhabitant of the enemy's territory."</P>
<P>On Saturday, the twenty-fifth of July la&s;t, the lords com|mi&s;&s;ioners of appeals, heard coun&s;el in behalf of the appellant and re&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Sir William Scott, on the part of the claimant and apel|lant &s;tated, that American &s;hips in the time of peace, wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the con&s;tant practice of carrying flour and provi&s;ions to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> French We&s;t-India i&s;lands. It is true, that an order of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was made on the &s;ixth of November, 1793, and an in&s;truction on it, directing all &s;hips carrying &s;upplies to, or bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|duce from the French We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, to be brought i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> adjudication. But this order was never con&s;idered to extend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a condemnation, and it was revoked, and another in&s;truction i&s;&s;ued on the eighth of January, 1794.</P>
<P>Sir William Scott here referred to the ca&s;es of the Fair La|dy, the Hetty, the Liberty, and the E&s;&s;ex, as tending to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|bli&s;h the free trade of the Americans to the French We&s;t-In|dia i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Lord Manefield expre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doubts as to this broad affec|tion of &s;ir William Scott. And.</P>
<P>Sir W.

<P>Mr. Er&s;kime, the re&s;pondent's coun&s;el, agreed to argue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e on its particular circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Sir W. Scott in continuation contended, that as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> blockade, the Briti&s;h arms had not inve&s;ted the i&s;land, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way to &s;how their intention to make it the primary object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their attack, at the time of the capture of this ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P><PB N="135" REF="028389_0711_0FD8EE665672DB50">
As to mr. George Patter&s;on, the owner of the &s;hip, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a moiety of the cargo, it is contended that he is a native of Ire|land, and the doctrine of inalienable allegiance, as it formerly &s;tood, is &s;et up as a bar to his claim.</P>
<P>The independence of the American &s;tates has done away that doctrine, as to all per&s;ons &s;ettled there at the time of &s;uch independence; and the great number of per&s;ons who have emi|grated to America &s;ince the independence, will require a mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration before the doctrine will be applied to them.</P>
<P>Lord pre&s;ident Mansfield a&s;ked &s;ir William Scott, if he meant to contend that an Engli&s;hman could get rid of his allegiance by going to America more than he could by going to Ru&s;&s;ia, or any other country in Europe?</P>
<P>Sir William Scott declined the enquiry, but repeated his affection that the magnitude of the que&s;tion from the number of per&s;ons gone to America from this country, would requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the mo&s;t &s;erious deliberation of this board, before the doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ded to, was enforced to their prejudice.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the rolls ob&s;erved, that the que&s;tion would probably require &s;ome under&s;tanding between the two countries.</P>
<P>Sir William Scott proceeded; he remarked, that as to are George Patter&s;on's birth and re&s;idence, the third witne&s;s con|tradicts the other two, and &s;ays, he believes mr. Patter&s;on was born in America; &s;o that the fact is not proved; and as to his re&s;idence, he appears to have gone to Guadaloupe on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion only, and to have had no re&s;idence there; and as to the clearing out for St. Bartholomew, upon which much &s;tre&s;s is laid, the fact is, the &s;hip was cleared out for that i&s;land, (which is Dani&s;h) and for a market.</P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine in reply, declared he was more convinced than our that he was founded in a&s;king for confirmation of the &s;en|tence of condemnation, as it is evident that the urgent, want of provi&s;ions was the &s;ole inducement to let the &s;hip take back the cargo of &s;ugar and coffee, without which &s;he could only have taken mela&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He contended that the voyage may &s;trictly be con&s;idered as ma&s;ked, the i&s;land of St. Bartholomew being a kind of empo|rium, and the words "for a market," a mere cover; and as to the &s;eizure of the cargo by the French, it is evident that the owner was &s;o well reconciled as to talk of &s;ending a further cargo. He did not a&s;k for condemnation on the letter of &s;ir John Jervis; he admitted the a&s;&s;ertion of &s;ir William Scott, as
<PB N="136" REF="028389_0712_0FD8EE674FE92690">to its want of logical accuracy. Self-pre&s;ervation, however, was e&s;&s;ential, and as much a principle with nations as with indivi|duals, and the political exi&s;tence of this country ju&s;tified his expectation of condemnation.</P>
<P>Martinique was then reduced; and mr. Patter&s;on mu&s;t have known it, and been well a&s;&s;ured that Guadaloupe was an im|mediate object of the Briti&s;h arms.</P>
<P>America, he contended, was entitled to no more and no le&s;s than other nations; and he had no doubt but that if mr. Pat|ter&s;on &s;hould, on further enquiry (if it &s;hould be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make it) appear to be a Briti&s;h &s;ubject by birth, his property would be liable to condemnation.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el having clo&s;ed their arguments, the lords, viz. the earl of Mansfield, lord pre&s;ident of the council; &s;ir R. P. Arden, knight, ma&s;ter of the rolls; &s;ir W.

<P>The lords having heard the proofs read, and advocates and proctors on both &s;ides, under all the &s;pecial circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, by their interlocutory decree, pronounced again&s;t the appeal, affirmed the &s;entence appealed from, and remitted the cau&s;e.</P>

<P>From the above &s;tatement and deci&s;ion, it appears that the pro&s;pect of an indemnification by appeal, is delu&s;ive. The cir|cum&s;tances attending this capture, are as favourable as any that can be brought before "his maje&s;ty's high court of ap|peal for prizes." To look for indemnification from this quarter, is nothing more not le&s;s, than expo&s;ing our&s;elves to have <HI>in|&s;ult</HI> added to <HI>outrage.</HI></P>
<P>At this early period of the bu&s;ine&s;s, we find the operation of the treaty. The property of the American merchant is become the mere &s;port of the lords of the admiralty. If this is the effect in this in&s;tance even before the complete ratifi|cation of the treaty, what may we not expect when it become in full force? Does this deci&s;ion expre&s;s the temper and feel|ings of the citizens of the United States, which mr. Jay was expre&s;sly commi&s;&s;ioned to repre&s;ent?

If they are, what balance will be on the &s;ide of the Americans? <HI>Not a &s;hilling</HI>&mdash;but the amount of <HI>millions</HI> will become a clear debt again&s;t the United Staten. Thus, by mr. Jay's treaty, we have &s;ubmitted our claims to the deci&s;ion of the lords of the admiralty, who, no doubt, will decide <HI>in every ca&s;e</HI> as they have in the preceding; while the claims of the Briti&s;h are admitted to be &s;ettled by com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who, no doubt. will draw an immen&s;e balance in favor of the Engli&s;h. <HI>Who then is to di&s;charge this debt?</HI> The American citizens. The <HI>merchant</HI> who has already lo&s;t his property mu&s;t be further taxed to pay Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The <HI>farmer</HI> who has had nothing to do in contracting it, mu&s;t be called on by a <HI>land tax.</HI> The fact is, we had better have waved our claims for indemnification, and quietly, pa&s;&s;ively, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, <HI>like good &s;ubjects of Britain,</HI> have acquie&s;eed in their depredations. By mr.

<P>The in&s;ults offered to this country, are without parallel. We mu&s;t be held in abhorrence by all European nations, and de&s;|pi&s;ed for our pu&s;illanimity even by the Briti&s;h them&s;elves. Our friends in England pity us, and our enemies laugh at us.

<P>Whereas, by the articles agreed upon on the 30th of No|vember la&s;t, by and between the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Uni|ted States of America for making peace, and commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of his Britannic maje&s;ty, it is &s;tipulated, that his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all convenient &s;peed, and with|out cau&s;ing any de&s;truction, or carrying away any negroes, or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garri&s;ons and fleets, from the &s;aid United States, and from every port, place, and harbour within the &s;ame:&mdash;and whereas, a con&s;iderable number of negroes belonging to citizens of the&s;e &s;tates have been carried off therefrom, <HI>contrary to the true intent and meaning of the &s;aid articles:</HI></P>

<HEAD>Remarks on the above.</HEAD>
<P>If, then, congre&s;s, as early as May 1783, complained of this infraction, they mu&s;t have regarded it as the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> breach; for Great-Britain had not yet had time to hear of what was pa&s;&s;ing in this country on the &s;ubject of the treaty, much le&s;s
<PB N="142" REF="028389_0718_0FD8EE7847F8B9C8">to complain of any violation on our part. It will be recollec|ted, that the treaty had been received by congre&s;s early is the preceding month.</P>
<P>By this re&s;olve, it al&s;o appears, that colonel Hamilton thought the treaty binding from the &s;ignature of the provi|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> articles; but Camillus contends, that it was not &s;o un|til the exchange of the ratification of the definitive articles which took place more than one year later.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only in&s;tance in which our government <HI>formally and expi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tly</HI> took this ground, although one would be led to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">inde from Camillus, that to mr.

<P>On the 11th April, 1783, congre&s;s agreed to a proclama|tion, declaring a ce&s;tation of ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">es; and only four days after,</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, that the commander in chief be in&s;tructed to make the proper arrangements with the commander in chief of the Briti&s;h forces, for receiving po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts is the United States occupied by the troops of his Britannic maje&s;ty, and <HI>for obtaining the delivery of all negroes and other property of the inhabitants of the United States in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h forces, or any &s;ubject of, or adherent to his &s;aid Britannic maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Again, on the 9th Augu&s;t, 1786, congre&s;s re&s;olved, that the &s;ecretary for foreign affairs cau&s;e to be made out &s;eparate li&s;ts of the numbers, names, and owners of the negroes be|longing to the citizens of each &s;tate, and carried away by the Briti&s;h, <HI>in contravention of the treaty,</HI> and that he tran&s;mit the &s;aid li&s;ts to the executives of the &s;tates to which they re&s;pec|tively belong.</P>

<P>The above re&s;olves, and particularly the fir&s;t, prove un|equivocally, that col.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was my intention when I began the&s;e letters, to con&s;ider the treaty in all its relations; but as the merchants and traders of Philadelphia, and the chambers of commerce of New York and Bo&s;ton have held up the idea of unimportance to our commerce, have deemed it a thing unworthy the attention of any other people than merchants, and not worth the ri&s;k of di&s;plea&s;ing Great Britain, I will not differ with them, more e&s;pecially as the pre&s;ident has given them an exclu&s;ive privilege to think on this &s;ubject; but I will proceed to examine the con&s;titutional and political features of this mon&s;ter of <HI>"horrid mien, that to be hated needs but to be &s;een."</HI> Not being in the ha|bit of weighing my rights and my happine&s;s in <HI>a gold &s;cales,</HI> I can the more readily di&s;mi&s;s the commercial con&s;ideration of the treaty; and as a few merchants and traders have in&s;olently and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly monopolized the right to judge of things relating to commerce, they certainly will not deny others the exclu&s;ive privilege of deciding upon the con&s;titutional and po|litical parts, of which they &s;eem to be wholly ignorant. This is a <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> and has more reciprocity in it than the wife&s;t and mo&s;t profound of the addre&s;&s;ers can point out in the treaty.</P>
<P>The uncon&s;titutional origin of the treaty, has been already &s;hown in the <HI>"letters of Franklin,"</HI> to which I take the liberty to refer you, my fellow citizens, while I proceed to &s;how the uncon&s;titutionality of the in&s;trument it&s;elf. The treaty has e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule of naturalization, within the precincts or ju|ri&s;diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, by which Briti&s;h &s;ubjects can become American citizens within any term of one year. The con&s;titution expre&s;sly declares, that <HI>congre&s;s</HI> &s;hall have power <HI>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of naturalization, throughout the United States."</HI> Here then the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have not only u&s;urped the power of congre&s;s, to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule of natu|ralization, but they have been guilty of a two-fold breach of the con&s;titution, by making that rule not <HI>"uniform."</HI> During the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the federal legi&s;lature, an <HI>uniform</HI> law of natural|ization
<PB N="148" REF="028389_0724_0FD8EE8582646570">was pa&s;&s;ed, by which a <HI>five years re&s;idence</HI> is made ne|ce&s;&s;ary to obtain citizen&s;hip; but this law has been &s;uper&s;eded by treaty; and a Briti&s;h &s;ubject may become an American citi|zen in <HI>one week</HI> after the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts! The mo&s;t de&s;|perate <HI>"Antifederali&s;t"</HI> could not have aimed a more deadly blow at the con&s;titution than the treaty has done; and if rendering the con&s;titution a <HI>no&s;e of wax,</HI> can be called <HI>di&s;organization, Ja|cobini&s;m,</HI> or <HI>anarchy,</HI> the pre&s;ident and &s;enate are the greate&s;t di&s;organizers, the mo&s;t furious Jacobins, and mo&s;t violent anarchi&s;ts, in the United States. If a compact, which ought to be held &s;acred, and which ought to be con&s;trued and exe|cuted &s;trictly, can be interpreted to mean any thing that floats in the mind, or flutters in the heart of the pre&s;ident, the &s;ecu|rity which we promi&s;ed our&s;elves is at an end, and we are lite|rally in the &s;ituation of our new allies, Great Britain; we have a con&s;titution in the clouds.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution declares, that <HI>"Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to di&s;po&s;e of, and make all needful rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, or of any particular &s;tate."</HI> By the treaty, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, in|&s;tead of <HI>"congre&s;s,"</HI> have made rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territory of the United States, and have prejudiced their claims, as well as the claims of individual &s;tates. The 2d arti|cle of the treaty guarantees to <HI>"all &s;ettlers and traders, within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts, all their property of every kind."</HI> Part of this property belongs to the <HI>United States,</HI> and part to <HI>individual &s;tates;</HI> and, notwith&s;tanding, the pre&s;ident and &s;enate have made rules and regulations re&s;pecting it. The con|&s;titution is &s;olemnly prohibitory upon every department of the government, with re&s;pect to the claims of the United States, or of individual &s;tates, when it declares, that <HI>"nothing in this con&s;titution &s;hall be &s;o con&s;trued as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular &s;tate;"</HI> and in defiance of this &s;olemn prohibition, this article was formed and ratified! The treaty of peace &s;tipulated, that the po&s;ts &s;hould be &s;urrendered with all convenient &s;peed; and from the date of the ratification of that treaty, all real property, not actually held by Briti&s;t &s;ubjects there, became ve&s;ted in the United States, and of in|dividual &s;tates; now, as a con&s;iderable part of the territory comprehended in the precincts or juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects <HI>&s;ince</HI> the treaty of peace, no department in the government could guarantee &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; as the claims of the United States, and of individu|al &s;tates, became prejudiced thereby. Admitting a right to make
<PB N="149" REF="028389_0725_0FD8EE8B1B40FD60">rules and regulations re&s;pecting the territory of the United States, that right appertains exclu&s;ively to <HI>congre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;titution declares that "<HI>congre&s;s</HI> &s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and <HI>with the Indian tribes.</HI>" By the 3d article of the treaty this power is a&s;&s;umed by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate; for it declares, that "no duty of entry &s;hal ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land or inland navigation into the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively, <HI>nor &s;hall the Indians, po&s;&s;ing or re|pa&s;&s;ing with their own proper goods and effects, of whatever nature, pay for the &s;ame any impo&s;t or duty whatever.</HI>" The power of <HI>congre&s;s</HI> to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, is thus de&s;troyed by a &s;ingle coup of the pre&s;idential and &s;enatorial hands.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution "the judical power of the United States &s;hall be ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as <HI>the congre&s;s</HI> may from time to time ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h." By the 6th article of the treaty, a judicial power is given to five commi&s;&s;ioners, two of which are to be appointed by Great Bri|tain, and <HI>"the award of the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners is to be final and conclu&s;ive, both as to the ju&s;tice of the claim, and the amount of the &s;um to be paid to the creditor, or claimant."</HI> Here is a judicial power given by <HI>the pre&s;ident and &s;enate</HI> to five commi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>two</HI> of whom are to be <HI>foreigners,</HI> and a third may al&s;o be a fo|reigner; and the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are to have a final deci&s;ion upon the property of the people of the United States. To con|gre&s;s alone is given the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a judicial power; but even congre&s;s would hardly adventure &s;o to profane the con&s;ti|tution, as to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>mongrel</HI> tribunal of <HI>foreigners</HI> and citi|zens.

<P>THE Briti&s;h trade to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their Ea&s;t Indies, as well as to China, is a monopoly ve&s;ted by the legi&s;|lature in a company of merchants. No other per&s;ons in Great Britain, nor in any of her dominions or colonies, can &s;end a
<PB N="154" REF="028389_0730_0FD8EE945A6AB200">ve&s;&s;el to, or pro&s;ecute trade independent of the company, with any part of A&s;ia. The right to trade with their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India is not only refu&s;ed to all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, the India com|pany excepted, but is one, that Great Britain has never before yielded by treaty to any foreign nation. By the terms of the charter to the India company, among a variety of limitations, they are re&s;trained and confined to a direct trade between A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and the port of London; they are prohibited from bringing any of the productions of India or China directly to any part of America, as well to the Briti&s;h colonies as to our territories; and moreover they are re&s;trained from carrying any of the pro|ductions of A&s;ia, directly to any part of Europe, or to any port in Great Britain, Scotland, or Ireland, except the &s;ingle port of London.</P>
<P>The 13th article &s;tipulates, that our ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be admitted in all the &s;ea ports and harbours of the Briti&s;h territories in the Ea&s;t Indies, and that our citizens may freely carry on a trade between &s;aid territories and the United States, in all &s;uch arti|cles, of which the importation or exportation &s;hall not be en|tirely prohibited; provided only, that when Great Britain is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> war, we may not export from their terriories in India, without the permi&s;&s;ion of their local government thers, military &s;tores, naval &s;tores, or rice. Our ve&s;&s;els &s;hall pay in this trade, the &s;ame tonnage duty as is paid by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in our ports; and our cargoes on their importation and exportation &s;hall pay no other or higher charges or duties than &s;hall be payable on the &s;ame articles when imported or exported in Briti&s;h bottoms; but it is agreed that this trade &s;hall be direct between the United States and the &s;aid territories; that the article &s;hall not be deem|ed to allow the ve&s;&s;els of the United States to carry on any part of the coa&s;ting trade of the Briti&s;h territories in India, nor to allow our citizens to &s;ettle or re&s;ide within the &s;aid territo|ries, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the per|mi&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h local government there.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h trade to their territories in the Ea&s;t Indies is car|ried on by a corporation, who have a monopoly again&s;t the great body of Briti&s;h mechants. Our trade to the &s;ame territories will be open to the &s;kill and enter prize of every American citi|zen. The Briti&s;h trade to the&s;e territories is direct, but confined to the port of London; our trade to the &s;ame mu&s;t likewi&s;e be direct, but may be carried on from and to all our principal ports.</P>
<P>The article gives us a right in common with the India com|pany to carry to the&s;e territories, and to purcha&s;e and bring from thence, all articles which may be carried to or purcha&s;ed
<PB N="155" REF="028389_0731_0FD8EE969FC3AB08">and brought from the &s;ame, in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els: our cargoes paying native duties, and our &s;hips the &s;ame alien tonnage as Briti&s;h &s;hips pay in our ports. This trade is equally open to both nations; except when Great Britain is engaged in war, when the con&s;ent of the Briti&s;h local government is required in order to enable us to export naval &s;tores, military &s;tores, and rice; a limitation of &s;mall con&s;equence: none of the articles except nitre being likely to form any part of our return cargoes. Though this article is one again&s;t which the objection of a want of reciprocity (&s;o often, and &s;o uncandidly urged again&s;t other parts of the treaty) has not been preferred, it has not however e&s;caped cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that we are already in the enjoyment of a le&s;s re|&s;trained commerce with the Briti&s;h territories in India, and that the treaty will alter it for the wor&s;e: in as much as we thereby incapacitate our&s;elves to carry on any part of the coa&s;t|ing trade of the Briti&s;h territories in India, and as we relinqui&s;h the profitable freights to be made between Bombay and Canton, and likewi&s;e tho&s;e &s;ometimes obtained from the Engli&s;h territo|ries in Bengal to O&s;tend.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to &s;ay, that this trade has heretofore exi&s;ted by the mere indulgence of tho&s;e who per|mitted it, that it was liable to variations, that a total exclu&s;ion, e&s;pecially had it been of us in common with other foreign na|tions, could have afforded no ju&s;t ground of complaint: That the relaxation which has hitherto given us admi&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h India territories, was not a permanent, but a mere tem|porary and occa&s;ional regulation, liable to alteration, and by no means to be demanded as the ba&s;is of an intercour&s;e to be ad|ju&s;ted by compact, with a foreign nation, which would no long|er leave the power of alteration in either of the parties.</P>
<P>But in re&s;pect to the fir&s;t objection, the article amounts to this, that the rights which it does grant, &s;hall not by implica|tion be con&s;trued to give a right to carry on any part of the Briti&s;h coa&s;ting trade in India.</P>
<P>If we have before &s;hared in this trade by permi&s;&s;ion, nothing in the article will preclude us from enjoying the &s;ame in future. If we did not participate in it, nothing in the article impairs either the authority of the Briti&s;h local government to permit our participation or our capacity to profit by &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion&mdash; This objection, therefore, falls to the ground, &s;ince the coa&s;ting trade remains as it was before the treaty was formed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms u&s;ed clearly denote this and nothing more; they are&mdash;"It is al&s;o under&s;tood that the <HI>permi&s;&s;ion granted by this article</HI> is not to extend to <HI>allow.</HI>" This does not negative any pre-exi&s;ting indulgence, but merely provides that the main grant &s;hall not convert the <HI>revocable indulgence,</HI> if any there was in this par|ticular, into an <HI>irrevocable right</HI> by treaty.</NOTE></P>

Again&mdash;Surat, which is in the neighbourhood of Bombay, is the emporium of the Guzeat, and of the northern portion of the Malabar coa&s;t; the cottons &s;hipped from Bombay to Canton, are frequently fir&s;t &s;ent from Surat to Bombay. Surat belongs to the native powers to which we have free acce&s;s. If the tran&s;portation of cotton and &s;ome few other commodities from the coa&s;t of Malabar to Canton is an important branch of our commerce, what will prevent our pro&s;ecuting it from Surat or any other free port in the hither Indies?</P>
<P>That it may be undertaken from the ports of the native pow|ers is rendered probable, by the circum&s;tance, that the&s;e freights are &s;upplied principally or alone by the native or black mer|chants, who&s;e re&s;idence would naturally be in the ports under native juri&s;diction more frequently than in tho&s;e under the ju|ri&s;diction of any of the foreign powers.</P>
<P>But is it not true (and will not candour admit it) that the trade to the A&s;iatic dominions of the European powers has u&s;u|ally been confined to the nation to whom &s;uch territories be|long? In our treaty with Holland, have we not even &s;tipulated to re&s;pect their monopoly of this trade?

<P>A late decree of the convention which opened to us the ports in their We&s;t Indies, likewi&s;e laid open their remaining terri|tories in A&s;ia&mdash;But this mea&s;ure proceeding from the nece&s;&s;i|ties of the war and their inability to carry on their foreign commerce, will change hereafter, as heretofore it has done, with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace&mdash;Did this opinion require to be &s;trengthened, it is abundantly confirmed by the navigation act, decreed by the convention: The operation whereof is &s;u&s;|pended for the &s;ame rea&s;on that induced the opening to foreign|ers that trade to their colonies and territories in the We&s;t and Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h for more than a hundred years excluded foreign|ers from a &s;hare in their Ea&s;t India trade; for a few years pa&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="028389_0734_0FD8EE9EEE9798D8">they relaxed in the rigour of this &s;y&s;tem. We have availed our&s;elves of this circum&s;tance, and &s;hared with them in their India commerce. But this permi&s;&s;ion can be viewed only as an occa&s;ional departure from a general law; which may be affect|ed by a change of circum&s;tances, the duration of which, there|fore, is uncertain. The lo&s;s and inconvenience to which our merchants may be expo&s;ed from the pro&s;ecution of a trade, depending on regulations ari&s;ing from incon&s;tant circum&s;tances, and which frequently vary, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be guard|ed again&s;t, where the &s;cene is not remote, and the alterations in the laws can be known &s;oon after they are made. But in the A&s;tatic and our other di&s;tant commerce, it is of importance that the laws under which an adventure is begun, &s;hould be permanent. Lo&s;&s;es to a con&s;iderable amount have been expe|rienced by &s;ome of our merchants, who have undertaken di&s;|tant voyages in the expectation of the continuation of the&s;e temporary regulations. The trade, for example, to the Cape of Good Hope which the Dutch government ordinarily mo|nopolize to their own people) was &s;ome time &s;ince opened to foreigners, and &s;ome of our citizens profited by it; but others who had engaged in large adventures to that market, &s;uffered no &s;mall di&s;appointment and lo&s;s in finding them&s;elves excluded, upon their arrival by a repeal of the permi&s;&s;ion to foreigners to trade there. It mu&s;t then be con&s;idered as an important object &s;ecured, in re&s;pect to the principal proportion of our India trade, that alone which is capable of being pur&s;ued as a branch of our commerce, that the treaty turns a <HI>favor</HI> into a <HI>right,</HI> and that our direct intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h territories in the Ea&s;t Indies, in all re&s;pects as broad as that of Great Britain her&s;elf (except in the articles of rice, naval and military &s;tores, when Great Britain is engaged in war) in&s;tead of being an un|certain and hazardous trade, as heretofore, from its precarious nature, it has been, will, hereafter, be as certain as any in which our merchants &s;hall engage.</P>
<P>It is further alleged, by way of objection to this article, that it does not &s;ecure to our citizens a right to re&s;ide and &s;ettle in the Briti&s;h territories in India, without the con&s;ent of the Bri|ti&s;h local government. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ervation that has been made on a &s;imilar objection, in re&s;pect to the coa&s;ting trade in India, is equally applicable to this. The article leaves &s;ubjects preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation in which it found them. But let it be remem|bered that the di&s;proportion between the numbers of the native Indians and the foreigners inhabiting their country, is more than one thou&s;and of the former to one of the latter&mdash;that the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination among the foreigners
<PB N="159" REF="028389_0735_0FD8EEA208041FC0">are therefore e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the Briti&s;h authori|ty over that country&mdash;that no foreigner, or even a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject, is allowed to re&s;ide there, except in the character of a &s;ervant of the company, or of a licen&s;ed inhabitant&mdash;that it has long been held as a &s;ound opinion, that unre&s;trained liberty to the Europeans to emigrate to, and &s;ettle among the Indians, would, in a &s;hort time, overturn and de&s;troy the Briti&s;h empire in India&mdash;This danger would by no means be dimini&s;hed by conferring a right upon the Americans, freely to re&s;ide and &s;et|tle in India&mdash;that we &s;hall be allowed to re&s;ide and &s;ettle there by permi&s;&s;ion of the local Briti&s;h government, is fairly to be inferred from the article. But an ab&s;olute right to an entire liberty on the&s;e points, might evidently be dangerous to the Briti&s;h government over India&mdash;and in prudence could not have been &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>The advantageous footing, on which the trade is placed, is &s;o evident, that tho&s;e who had no reliance on the objections urged again&s;t it, but who, neverthele&s;s, have been unwilling to allow the treaty any merit on the &s;core of this article, have en|deavoured to &s;how that our India trade is of little importance, and of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>Whatever article can be &s;upplied by the India company, may likewi&s;e be &s;upplied by us, and &s;ome of them on better terms by us, than by them: The reports of the committee of the di|rectors of the Ea&s;t India company, publi&s;hed in 1793, when their charter was renewed, afford u&s;eful information on this &s;ubject, and di&s;clo&s;e facts which &s;how the advantages that we &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s in this trade over the company.

<P>If we appreciate the advantage we have over them, in &s;uch particles of &s;upply as are of our own growth or production, as well as in the wines not unu&s;ually procured by touching at Ma|deira on the outward voyage to India, and compare it with the advantage that they have over us in the few articles of choice, which they purcha&s;e at the fir&s;t hands, and which we mu&s;t im|port in order to re-export to India, it is probable that our car|goes to India, will, on the whole, be laid in as advantageou&s;ly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f not more &s;o, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e of the India company.

<P>Third. The European intercour&s;e with A&s;ia is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, conducted by corporation or exclu&s;ive companies&mdash;and all expe|rience has proved that in every &s;pecies of bu&s;ine&s;s (that of bank|ing and a few analagous employments excepted) in conducting of which, a competition &s;hall exi&s;t between individuals and cor|porations, the &s;uperior economy, enterprize, zeal, and per&s;e|verance of the former, will make them an overmarch for the latter; and that while individuals acquire riches, corporations, engaged in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, often &s;ink their capital and become bankrupt. The Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India company are more overbur|dened with various terms and conditions, which they are re|quired to ob&s;erve in their A&s;iatic trade, and which operate as &s;o many advantages in favor of their rivals in the &s;upply of fo|reign markets. The company, for example, are obliged annu|ally to inve&s;t a large capital in the purcha&s;e of Briti&s;h manufac|tures to be exported and &s;old by them in India; the lo&s;s on the&s;e inve&s;tments is con&s;iderable every year, as few of the ma|nufactures which they are obliged to purcha&s;e, will &s;ell in India for their co&s;t and charges&mdash;Be&s;ides, from the policy of protect|ing the home manufactures, the company are, in a great mea|&s;ure, &s;hut out from &s;upplying India goods for the home con|&s;umption of Great Britain. Mo&s;t of the goods which they im|port from India, are re-exported with additional charges, incur|red by the regulations of the company, to foreign markets, in &s;upplying of which we &s;hall be their rivals, as from the infor|mation of intelligent merchants, it is a fact that A&s;iatic goods, including the teas of China, are on average, cheaper within the United States than in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Fourth. The manufactures of A&s;ia are not only cheaper here than in Europe, but in general they are cheaper than goods of equal quality of European manufacture&mdash;So long as from the cheapne&s;s of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and the immen&s;e population of In|dia (the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h territories only being e&s;timated at forty millions) the labour of a manufacturer can be procured from two to three pence &s;terling per day, the &s;imilar manufac|tures of Europe, aided with all their ingenious machinery, is likely, on a fair competition, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, to be ex|cluded by tho&s;e of India. So apprehen&s;ive have the Briti&s;h go|vernment been of endangering their home manufactures by the permi&s;&s;ion of A&s;iatic goods to be con&s;umed in Great Britain, that they have impo&s;ed eighteen per cent, duties on the gro&s;s &s;ales of all India mu&s;lins, which is equal to twenty-two per|cent, on their prime co&s;t: The duties on cour&s;er India goods
<PB N="162" REF="028389_0738_0FD8EEA85A484580">are &s;till higher, and a long catalogue of A&s;iatic articles, includ|ing all &s;tained and printed goods, is prohibited from being con|&s;umed in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h manufacturers were not &s;atisfied even with this prohibitory &s;y&s;tem&mdash;And on the late renewal of the company's charter, they urged the total exclu&s;ion from Briti&s;h con&s;ump|tion of all India goods, and moreover propo&s;ed that the com|pany &s;hould be held to import annually from India a large amount of raw materials, and particularly cotton, for the &s;up|ply of the Briti&s;h manufacturers.</P>

<P>By the&s;e &s;tipulations it is agreed, that the people and inha|bitants of the United States and of the Briti&s;h dominions in Europe, &s;hall have the right to carry on trade between the &s;aid territories in all articles and commodities in which any other foreign nation may trade with either of the parties; that the impo&s;t or duties on any article in the cour&s;e of &s;uch trade, &s;hall be no other or higher than the lowe&s;t impo&s;ts or duties paid by any other foreign nation on the like article; that both parties &s;hall remain free, totally to prohibit the importation or export|ation, to or from their re&s;pective territories, of any &s;pecies of goods or merchandize, or to increa&s;e the exi&s;ting duties, or to impo&s;e new ones on the importation of any &s;pecies of goods or merchandizes, into their re&s;pective territories; &s;uch prohibiti|ons and duties operating equally again&s;t all foreign nations. So far as re&s;pects the interchange of commodities between the par|ties, the&s;e &s;tipulations breathe the &s;pirit of reciprocity: the re|&s;idue of the fifteenth article principally relates to the navigati|on which the parties &s;hall employ in this trade.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t clau&s;e of the 15th article, in the &s;pirit of tho&s;e treaties which mutually confer the right of the mo&s;t favored na|tions, &s;tipulates that no other or higher duties &s;hall be paid by the &s;hips of the one party in the ports of the other, than &s;uch as are paid by the like ve&s;&s;els of all other nations.</P>
<P>By our laws, a difference exi&s;ts between the tonnage d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty paid by an American ve&s;&s;el, and that paid by a foreign ve&s;&s;el in our ports&mdash;the American ve&s;&s;el pays only &s;ix cents per ton on her entry&mdash;the foreign ve&s;&s;el, on her entry, pays fifty cents per ton, and about twenty per cent. more duties on all teas import|ed from Europe, and ten per cent. more duties on the importa|tion of other goods, than are payable on the importation of the &s;ame goods, in an American ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>By the Briti&s;h laws, the differences between the duties paid by Briti&s;h and foreign ve&s;&s;els in the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, is le&s;s than that which exi&s;ts in our ports:&mdash;the con&s;equence is that a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, of a given burden, pays con&s;iderably mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tonnage duties in the trade between our territories and the Bri|ti&s;h ports in Europe, than is paid by an American ve&s;&s;el of the &s;ame burden, engaged in the &s;ame trade.</P>
<P>The trade being laid open to both parties, the principle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> equalization of duties was very naturally deemed an equitable ba&s;is of treaty. This could be effected by lowering the Ame|rican alien duties to the Briti&s;h &s;tandard, or by rai&s;ing tho&s;e of Great Britain to the American &s;tandard. The former might
<PB N="165" REF="028389_0741_0FD8EEAF52903280">have been inconvenient to our revenue, e&s;pecially &s;ince, if it was not general, it would have formed, in re&s;pect to foreign nations, an unplea&s;ant di&s;crimination in our laws.</P>
<P>The American tonnage duty, therefore, was left to operate; and by the 15th article is is agreed, that the Briti&s;h govern|ment &s;hall re&s;erve a right to rai&s;e the tonnage duty on our ve&s;&s;els entering their ports in Europe, &s;o as to make it <HI>equal</HI> to the tonnage duty payable by their ve&s;&s;els entering our ports: And in order to balance the difference of duties on goods imported into our ports by American or by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, the effect whereof is the &s;ame as that which proceeds from an alien ton|nage duty, the article further agrees, that the Briti&s;h govern|ment &s;hall re&s;erve a right to impo&s;e &s;uch duty as may be ade|quate to effect this end. The preceding clau&s;e of this article &s;tipulates, that the ve&s;&s;els and cargoes of each &s;hall pay no high|er, or other duties, than tho&s;e impo&s;ed on the like ve&s;&s;els and cargoes of all other nations; it was, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to re|&s;erve a right to increa&s;e again&s;t us, their alien tonnage duty, and to impo&s;e the countervailing duty in que&s;tion; as, without &s;uch re&s;ervation, the &s;ame could not have been done, unle&s;s by laws equally operating again&s;t all other nations&mdash;which would have been unju&s;t in reference to &s;uch of them as might not, like us, have di&s;criminated in their duties between their own and foreign ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Two methods have been &s;ugge&s;ted, by which this counter|vailing power might be executed.</P>
<P>One by impo&s;ing a <HI>pro rota</HI> duty on the importation of goods into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe by American ve&s;&s;els, equal to the difference between the duties payable in our ports on the importation of goods by American or Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The other, by impo&s;ing the identical duty on the exportation of goods from the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, by American ve&s;&s;els, which forms the difference between the duties payable on the importation of the &s;ame goods into our ports by American or Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>As the articles imported by our ve&s;&s;els into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, are di&s;&s;imilar from tho&s;e imported from the &s;ame into our ports, one rule of difference would not effect the equal|ization &s;ought for; and as our difference of duties is not the &s;ame on all articles, being higher on &s;ome than on others&mdash;and as, moreover, the quantities and amount of different articles differ widely, and are liable to continual proportional variations, no uniform average rule of countervailing the&s;e differences can be devi&s;ed; the correct execution, therefore, of this power, in
<PB N="166" REF="028389_0742_0FD8EEB0C4B6C1B0">the method fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, is impracticable, and, it is pre&s;umed, mu&s;t be di&s;carded.</P>
<P>The power, then, it would &s;eem, can only be equitably ex|erci&s;ed by impo&s;ing on the articles which we &s;hall export in A|merican ve&s;&s;els from the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a duty iden|tically the &s;ame as that which con&s;titutes, in any ca&s;e, the dif|ference of duty payable in our ports, on the &s;ame articles im|ported from the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, by a Briti&s;h or Ame|rican ve&s;&s;el. Thus they may impo&s;e on tea and other A&s;iatic goods, as well as on the European goods, which we &s;hall ex|port from the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, the identical duty or the &s;ame &s;um which con&s;titutes the difference of duties payable in our ports on the importation from thence of the &s;ame articles by an American or a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The right to countervail our alien tonnage duty by impo&s;ing an alien tonnage duty on our ve&s;&s;els entering the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, equal to that which &s;hall be payable on their ve&s;&s;els entering our ports, will continue &s;o long as the commercial treaty &s;hall endure, and will apply to any future increa&s;e of the tonnage duty on foreign ve&s;&s;els that we may e&s;tabli&s;h; it is however &s;tipulated in the conclu&s;ion of the fifteenth article, that we &s;hall ab&s;tain from increa&s;ing the tonnage duty on Bri|ti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and al&s;o from increa&s;ing the difference that now exi&s;ts between the duties payable on the importation of any ar|ticles into our ports in Briti&s;h or in American ve&s;&s;els, until the expiration of two years after the termination of the war be|tween France and Great Britain. But we are free to increa&s;e the one or the other, after the expiration of that period; and though the Briti&s;h government will have a right to countervail, by additional tonnage duties, on our ve&s;&s;els, any increa&s;e of that duty on their ve&s;&s;els; yet they will have no right to coun|tervail any increa&s;e of the difference between the duties payable on the importation of any articles into our ports, in Briti&s;h or in American ve&s;&s;els, unle&s;s by a duty common to all foreign nations; the right re&s;erved on this &s;ubject, being confined to the difference that <HI>now</HI> exi&s;ts, will not reach &s;uch future in|crea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">diculous, then, the argument, if the ba&s;is of it were otherwi&s;e true, that the treaty, by tying up the government from future di&s;crimination, has pro&s;trated our navigation be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re Great Britain? can a re&s;traint which is only to operate the &s;hort term of two years after the termination of the pre&s;ent war, have the mighty effect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing our navigation?</NOTE></P>
<P>From this analy&s;is of the 14th and 15th articles, we are the better enabled to perceive the truth of the following propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="167" REF="028389_0743_0FD8EEB43305D420">
1. As, for the purpo&s;e of encouraging or protecting the agri|culture and manufactures of Great Britain, &s;everal of our pro|ductions, in common with &s;imilar productions of the other na|tions, are prohibited from being imported into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe; we are free, whenever our intere&s;t &s;hall re|quire it, al&s;o to exclude any of the productions of the Briti&s;h dominions from being imported into our ports, extending &s;uch exclu&s;ions, as they do, to the like manufactures and producti|ons of foreign nations.</P>
<P>Should that part of the twelfth article, which has not been ratified, in its modification retain the &s;tipulation relative to the importation of coffee, &s;ugar, and the other productions of the We&s;t Indies, it would con&s;titute an exception to this propo&s;iti|on. But as the We&s;t India productions are di&s;&s;imilar to tho&s;e of our own country, they would not fall within the rea&s;on of the&s;e prohibitions, and, therefore, the exception would be of no con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="2">2. As, for the like rea&s;ons, &s;ome of our productions are &s;ubject, in common with the like productions of other nations, to high, or prohibitory duties in the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, we are free, likewi&s;e, to impo&s;e &s;imilar duties on any of the productions or manufactures of the Briti&s;h dominions, extend|ing &s;uch duties, as they do, to the like productions and manu|factures of other foreign nations.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the navigation act of Great Britain, in order to ex|tend their own &s;hipping, has heretofore confined the importati|on of foreign productions into the Briti&s;h ports, to Briti&s;h &s;hips, and to the &s;hips of the country producing the &s;ame; the 15th article appears to contain an important innovation on this ce|lebrated act; ina&s;much as, by the mo&s;t obvious con&s;truction of the terms, it gives us a right to import from our own territo|ries into the Briti&s;h ports in Europe every article and de&s;cripti|on of goods and merchandizes, which any nation in their own &s;hips is allowed to import&mdash;In con&s;equence whereof, while all other foreign nations are prohibited and re&s;trained from import|ing in their own ve&s;&s;els into Great Britain any goods or mer|chandizes, except tho&s;e of their own particular growth, pro|duce, or manufacture, we, by the treaty, have a right to carry from our ports to the Briti&s;h ports in Europe, not only goods and merchandizes of our own growth, produce, or manufac|ture, but al&s;o all &s;uch goods and merchandizes, the growth, produce; or manufacture of any foreign nation, as a nation producing or manufacturing the &s;ame, would import in their ve&s;&s;els into Great Britain.</P>

4.

By the third and fourth articles of our treaty with France, and by the 2d and 3d articles of our treaty with Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|&s;ia, it is &s;tipulated, that the &s;ubjects and citizens of the re|&s;pective parties, &s;hall pay, in the ports, havens, and places of each other, no other or greater duties or impo&s;ts, of what&s;oe|ver nature they may be, than tho&s;e which the nations mo&s;t fa|vored &s;hall be obliged to pay: and moreover, that they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges and exemptions is trade, navigation, and commerce, which the &s;aid nations do, or &s;hall enjoy: and by the 2d article of the former, and the 26th article of the latter treaty, the parties agree mutually, not to grant any particular favor, in re&s;pect to navigation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> commerce, which &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favor, if freely grant|ed, or on allowing the &s;ame compen&s;ation, if the conce&s;&s;ion was conditional.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulations in the three treaties are, on the&s;e points, equivalent.</P>
<P>The 2d and 3d articles of our treaty with Holland, and the 3d and 4th of our treaty with Sweden, likewi&s;e contain mutu|al &s;tipulations, that the &s;ubjects and citizens of the &s;everal par|ties &s;hall pay in the ports, havens, and places of their re&s;pect|ive countries, no other or higher duties or impo&s;ts than tho&s;e which the nations mo&s;t favored &s;hall pay; and that they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, and exemptions in trade and navigation, which the &s;aid nations &s;hall enjoy.</P>

2. The articles before us, after &s;tipulating that there &s;hall be between our territories and the Briti&s;h dominions in Europe, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce, declare, that the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;ubject always to the laws of the re&s;pective coun|tries. The introductory articles of our treaties with France, Holland, and Sweden, after a&s;&s;erting the intentions of the par|ties to take equality and reciprocity as their ba&s;is, likewi&s;e leave each party at liberty to form &s;uch regulations re&s;pecting com|merce and navigation as it &s;hall find convenient to it&s;elf&mdash;and the 2d and 3d articles of our treaty with Pru&s;&s;ia, after &s;tipulat|ing the rights of the parties, re&s;pecting the duties and impo&s;ts, and the freedom of their navigation and trade, likewi&s;e require their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws and u&s;ages e&s;tabli&s;hed in the two countries.</P>
<P N="3">3. The articles before us, in their provi&s;ions relative to na|vigation, &s;tipulate, as has been already ob&s;erved, in common with our other treaties, that the &s;hips of the parties &s;hall not be &s;ubject to higher or other duties, than tho&s;e paid by all o|ther nations. They go farther, and agree to vary this rule, &s;o far as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to equalize the tonnage duty impo&s;ed by the parties on the &s;hips of each other. Our treaty with France is the only one in which we di&s;cover a &s;imilar &s;tipulati|on.&mdash;France had a high alien tonnage duty on all foreign ve&s;|&s;els tran&s;porting the merchandize of France from one port to another port in her dominions. We had a le&s;s alien tonnage duty on foreign &s;hips employed in a &s;imilar trade: though not equally exten&s;ive; the ca&s;e is parallel to that which exi&s;ts be|tween us and Great Britain. We have a high alien tonnage duty on all foreign ve&s;&s;els entering our ports; Great Britain has a le&s;s alien tonnage duty on foreign ve&s;&s;els entering her ports. In our treaty with France we re&s;erve a right to coun|tervail the alien tonnage duty impo&s;ed by France; and in like manner, in our treaty with Great Britain, &s;he re&s;erves a right to countervail the alien tonnage duty impo&s;ed by us. The ob|ject, in both in&s;tances, has been to place the navigation of the parties on the footing of exact equality.</P>
<P>The preceding expo&s;ition of the&s;e articles, illu&s;trated by the compari&s;on of their provi&s;ions, with the analagous articles of our other treaties, would be &s;ufficient to vindicate them again&s;t the objections to which they have been expo&s;ed.&mdash;It is, howe|ver, thought advi&s;eable to take notice of &s;uch of the&s;e objecti|ons as are likely to have any influence on the public opinion&mdash; This will be done in a &s;ub&s;equent number.</P>

<P>AN extraordinary con&s;truction of the la&s;t clau&s;e of the fourteenth article has been a&s;&s;umed by the writer of Ca|to; his mi&s;take in this in&s;tance has been the foundation of ma|ny of the errors with which that performance abounds. The article &s;tipulates that there &s;hall be a perfect and reciprocal li|berty of navigation and commerce between our territories and tho&s;e of Great Britain in Europe, &s;ubject <HI>always</HI> to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries, re&s;pectively.

<P>The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, in &s;upport of this interpretation, is, that the article would be nugatory, did not the laws and &s;ta|tutes alluded to, mean only tho&s;e in exi&s;tence at the making of the treaty; &s;ince future laws might impair or de&s;troy wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the article confers.</P>
<P>Nothing in the expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves requires this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|pretation.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary and e&s;tabli&s;hed meaning of them in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> treaties would lead to a rejection of it.&mdash;The object of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> clau&s;e is not the limitation of the legi&s;lative power of the par|ties, but the &s;ubjection of their mutual navigation and com|merce to their re&s;pective laws.&mdash;This end is mo&s;t fully atta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed by under&s;tanding the parties to mean their future as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their exi&s;ting laws.

The rea&s;on adduced by Cato to &s;upport his con&s;truction is equally defective with his interpretation it&s;elf. The fourteenth article is in general terms, and &s;imilar, as has been &s;hown, to the introductory articles of other treaties; &s;o far from the la&s;t clau&s;e thereof being capable of de&s;troying the preceding &s;tipu|lations; it is the peculiar province of the next article to a&s;cer|tain the points which the parties mutually agree to except from their legi&s;lative power. In all ca&s;es not thus excepted, the na|vigation and commerce of the parties is &s;ubject to their exi&s;ting or future laws.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to remark on the &s;everal objections which have proceeded from the opinion that the treaty re&s;trains us from impo&s;ing prohibitory duties and exclu&s;ions: they are but &s;ubdi|vi&s;ions of the error that has been ju&s;t combatted.</P>
<P>Another objection which has been &s;tated by &s;everal writers, and much laboured by Cato, is, that under the right re&s;erved to the Briti&s;h government to countervail an alien tonnage duty, by the impo&s;ition of an equivalent one on our ve&s;&s;els entering their ports, they would gain and we &s;hould lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Several methods are adopted to prove this opinion. The ob|&s;ervation that we have a tonnage duty on our own ve&s;&s;els, and that Great Britain has none, is repeated by way of objection again&s;t this as well as again&s;t the propo&s;ed adju&s;tment contain|ed in the 12th article. The &s;ame reply already given might be &s;ufficient in this place.</P>
<P>But is it true that Briti&s;h &s;hips entering their own ports in Europe are wholly free from a tonnage duty? the contrary is the fact; &s;ince it is under&s;tood, that they pay a tonnage duty for the &s;upport of light hou&s;es, and &s;ome other in&s;titutions, con|nected with their navigation, which, in all their ports, exceeds the tonnage duty of &s;ix cents per ton, that we levy on the en|try of our own ve&s;&s;els employed in foreign trade. But Great Britain (it is alleged) will not only impo&s;e in virtue of this re|&s;erved right, fifty cents per ton on our ve&s;&s;els entering her ports, but in every port except that of London, &s;he will further|more exact one &s;hilling and nine pence &s;terling, or thirty nine cents per ton, for light money and Trinity-dues more than is paid by her own ve&s;&s;els; this, added to the difference before &s;tated, would have, it is &s;aid, a very di&s;couraging effect upon our navigation. Our tonnage duty is a tax not divided and appropriated, like the light money, or Trinity-dues, in Great Britain, to &s;pecific, and particular objects&mdash;but when levied, goes into the trea&s;ury with the duty of impo&s;t, and &s;tands ap|propriated to the various objects to which that duty is appropri|ated&mdash;among tho&s;e objects is the &s;upport of light-hou&s;es&mdash;it is
<PB N="172" REF="028389_0748_0FD8EEC387DB1BC0">not the object to which the tax is applied that gives a denomi|nation; whether it goes to &s;upport the civil li&s;t, or to pay an|nuities, or to maintain light hou&s;es, or to &s;upport ho&s;pitals, it is equally a tonnage duty. A tonnage duty then of a cer|tain amount, is now paid by American ve&s;&s;els entering the ports of Great Britain.

The countervailing right is not applicable to the whole duty payable on goods and merchandizes imported into our ports in Briti&s;h &s;hips, but expre&s;sly confined to the difference of duty now payable on the &s;ame when imported by American or by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els&mdash;This difference is one-tenth part of the duty upon all European goods, that is to &s;ay, the&s;e goods pay one-tenth part more duty when imported in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els than is paid on the &s;ame when imported in an American ve&s;&s;el; in all ca&s;es, therefore, where our impo&s;t is ten per cent. ad valorem, the difference of duty to be countervailed amounts to only one per cent. on the value of the goods, in&s;tead of ten percent. as is alleged by Cato; in the in&s;tance of teas imported from Eu|rope the difference is greater: again it is not an aggregate &s;um, that is to be apportioned under this countervailing right, for this &s;um would be liable to con&s;tant variation according to the quantity and &s;pecies of goods imported into our ports from time to time by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els; and be&s;ides, the Briti&s;h government po&s;&s;e&s;s no means whereby the amount thereof could be a&s;cer|tained.</P>

<P>It is further alleged, that the treaty wants reciprocity, ina&s;|much as the whole territory of the United States is laid open to the Briti&s;h navigation and commerce, while, in return, the Briti&s;h territories, <HI>in Europe only,</HI> are opened to us. The &s;hort an&s;wer to this allegation is, that it is not true.&mdash;All the Bri|ti&s;h territories in Europe are laid open to us; all their territories in A&s;ia are al&s;o opened to us; the treaty likewi&s;e opened all their territories in the We&s;t Indies. The article relative to this branch of trade, as has already been ob&s;erved, is excepted from the ratification of the treaty, and made the &s;ubject of future negociation. The Briti&s;h territories on our continent, that of the Hud&s;on's Bay company excepted, are al&s;o opened to us in like manner as ours are opened to them.

<P>The territory of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, the i&s;land of Newfoundland and the e&s;tabli&s;hments on the coa&s;t of Africa, are the only Briti&s;h dominions to which the treaty, in its origi|nal form does not give a right of intercour&s;e and trade.</P>

<P><PB N="177" REF="028389_0753_0FD8EECE506D8160">
Admitting the truth of this objection, it might be replied: So on the other hand, Great Britain can form no commercial treaty, whereby, for an advantage yielded on her part, &s;he may acquire &s;ome privilege in return, unle&s;s &s;he yields the &s;ame advantage to us gratuitou&s;ly and without receiving from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> equivalent; and as Great Britain, who&s;e commercial rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s are equally exten&s;ive with ours, and who&s;e capital far exceeds ours, is equally re&s;trained on this point, our chance of gain would be fully equal to our chance of lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But the allegation is not generally true, and the objection, when examined, will be found to be of little weight, even with tho&s;e who may imagine that nations do &s;ometimes make good bargains by the purcha&s;e of privileges and exemptions in their foreign trade. The ca&s;e that has been cho&s;en to enforce the objection, &s;hall be employed to invalidate it.</P>
<P>Admit that the treaty with Great Britain is in operation&mdash; that the oil and provi&s;ion merchants of the United States, and the wine and brandy merchants of France are de&s;irous of a treaty between the two countries, whereby tho&s;e commodities &s;hall be received from each other on low duties or freely&mdash;ad|mit farther, that the governments of the two nations are di&s;|po&s;ed to make &s;uch a treaty (this is the ca&s;e again put by the oppo&s;ers of the treaty as impracticable) what will re&s;train the conclu&s;ion of this treaty? The di&s;advantage that will ari&s;e from our treaty with Great Britain? No, for Britain produces nei|ther wines, nor brandy made from wines, with which &s;he could &s;upply us; &s;he therefore could gain nothing, nor &s;hould we lo&s;e any thing by the conclu&s;ion of &s;uch a treaty. All that will be requi&s;ite, therefore, in the formation of &s;uch treaties, will be to choo&s;e for the purpo&s;e &s;uch articles of the growth, manu|facture, or produce of any country with whom we de&s;ire to treat as are not common to it and the Briti&s;h dominions, and any &s;kilful merchant will quickly make the &s;election&mdash;Hence it appears that the objection is not well founded in point of fact.</P>
<P>But though it may be practicable, will it be politic in us to conclude no commercial treaties of this character with any na|tion? If we re&s;ort to precedents as guides, we &s;hall di&s;cover few, the hi&s;tory of which would encourage us. Indeed they are a de&s;cription of conventions not often formed between na|tions.</P>
<P>They are of difficult adju&s;tment, and nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the provi&s;ions of the commercial code, &s;ufficiently intricate, when only one rule prevails in re&s;pect to all nations. Be&s;ides, how|ever perfect may be the right of nations in this re&s;pect, yet

<P>Again, unle&s;s we are prepared, at the expen&s;e of the whole to procure advantages or privileges for a part of the community, we &s;hall doubt the policy of &s;uch &s;tipulations.

<P>We have another &s;pecimen of this &s;pecies of treaty in a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> convention between England and Portugal, concluded in 1703&mdash; the object was to procure a favorable market for di&s;&s;imilar com|modities, and &s;uch as were not the common production of the two countries. But this treaty, which has been &s;o much appla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d|ed, is e&s;&s;entially defective in point of reciprocity.

The ad|vantage therefore is manife&s;tly on the &s;ide of Portugal.

But in a nation like ours, compo&s;ed of different &s;tates, varying in cli|mate, productions, manufactures, and commercial pur&s;uits, it will be more difficult to enter into treaties of this kind.

We have once made an experiment of this kind&mdash;its fate &s;hould &s;erve as a caution to us in future. By the eleventh and twelfth articles of our treaty with France, it was agreed, that France &s;hould never impo&s;e any duty on the mela&s;&s;es that we &s;hould export from the French We&s;t Indies; and in compen&s;ation of this exemption, that we &s;hould never impo&s;e any duty on the exportation of any kind of merchandize by Frenchmen, from our territories, for the u&s;e of the French We&s;t Indies. The&s;e articles produced much di&s;&s;atisfaction in congre&s;s: It was &s;aid to be a benefit that would enure to the u&s;e and advantage of only a part, but which mu&s;t be compen&s;ated by the whole.

<P>THE &s;ixteenth article is entirely conformable to the u&s;age and cu&s;tom of nations. The exchange of con&s;uls had already taken place between us and Great Britain; and their functions and privileges being left to the definition of the law of nations, we &s;hall be exempt from tho&s;e unplea&s;ant contro|ver&s;ies that too often ari&s;e from &s;pecial conventions, which enlarge the con&s;ular privileges, power, and juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The agreement that either party may puni&s;h, di&s;mi&s;s, or &s;end back a con&s;ul for illegal or improper conduct, is calculated to prevent national mi&s;under&s;tandings, and to &s;ecure a re&s;pect|ful
<PB N="181" REF="028389_0757_0FD8EED7368BB308">deportment in the con&s;ular corps. I have not ob&s;erved that this article has been di&s;approved of from any quarter.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth article which re&s;pects the capture and deten|tion of the ve&s;&s;els of the parties on ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemy's property, or contraband of war, has been the object of intemperate cen&s;ure&mdash;with how much ju&s;tice it &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this paper to examine.</P>
<P>The principal complaint, is not, that the article expo&s;ed our own property to lo&s;s by capture, for this is not the ca&s;e, but that it does not protect enemy's property on board our ve&s;&s;els. The defence of the article will re&s;t upon the proofs which &s;hall be exhibited, that it is in conformity with, and &s;upported by, the clear and acknowledged law of nations&mdash;that law which pronounces that enemy's goods on the high &s;eas are liable to capture, and as a nece&s;&s;ary mean to this end, that neutral &s;hips are there liable to examination or &s;earch.</P>
<P>The law of nature (as heretofore ob&s;erved) applicable to in|dividuals in their independent or un&s;ocial &s;tate, is what, when applied to collections of individuals in &s;ociety, con&s;titutes the natural or nece&s;&s;ary law of nations. An individual in a &s;tate of nature, for reparation of injuries, or in defence of his per&s;on and property, has a right to &s;eize the property of his enemy, and to de&s;troy his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Nations always &s;ucceed to the rights that the individuals who compo&s;ed them enjoyed in a &s;tate of nature: and hence it is that by the law of nations, from the earlie&s;t annals of &s;ociety, the goods or property of one enemy has been con&s;idered as liable to be &s;eized and applied to the u&s;e of another. This right mu&s;t be &s;o u&s;ed as not to injure the rights of others: Subject to this limitation, it is perfect, and an interruption of it by another is an injury. As in a conte&s;t between two individuals in a &s;tate of nature, no third has a right, without becoming a party in the controver&s;y, to protect the property, or defend the per&s;on of either of the parties: So in a war between two na|tions no third nation can act out of its own juri&s;diction, con|&s;i&s;tent with the duties of neutrality; or, without becoming a party in the war, protect the property of, or defend either of the parties. Though nations are, in re&s;pect to each other, like individuals in a &s;tate of nature, the re&s;emblance is not in every particular perfect&mdash;Individuals in a &s;tate of nature have not only the inferior dominion or private owner&s;hip of property, but the entire and perfect dominion over it. In &s;ociety the lat|ter right belongs exclu&s;ively to the nation, while the former belongs to the &s;everal members that compo&s;e it. Immoveable things, &s;uch as lands, which are denominated the territory
<PB N="182" REF="028389_0758_0FD8EEDB938909A0">of a nation, are the immediate and &s;pecial objects of this per|fect dominion or paramount property.

<P>The main ocean not being within the territory, or &s;ubject to the exclu&s;ive dominion or any nation, is a place, where enemy goods may lawfully be captured. An impediment by
<PB N="183" REF="028389_0759_0FD8EEDD0E3350A0">any third nation to the exerci&s;e of the right of capture on the ocean by either of the belligerent parties, would be an injury.</P>
<P>As the goods of an enemy, within the territory of a neutral &s;tate, are under the protection thereof, the law of nations, for the rea&s;ons that have been &s;tated, will not permit us to take them: in like manner, we have no right to take them if they are on board a &s;hip, whil&s;t the &s;hip is in a neutral port, whe|ther the &s;hip it&s;elf is a neutral one, or belongs to an enemy, becau&s;e the port is a part of the territory.&mdash;When the goods of an enemy are on board the &s;hip of an enemy, and the &s;hip is in the main ocean, there is no doubt of our right to capture both the goods and the &s;hip, becau&s;e they are then in a place which is not the territory of any nation. But when the goods of an enemy are on board a neutral &s;hip, and the &s;hip is in the main ocean, though we have a right to take the goods, we have no right to take the &s;hip, or to detain her any longer, than is nece&s;&s;ary to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods&mdash;for the ocean it&s;elf is no territory&mdash;and neutral &s;hips, as they are moveable goods, can not be parts of the neutral territory; and con&s;e|quently are no more under the protection of the neutral &s;tate, than the &s;ame goods would be, if they were pa&s;&s;ing through an unoccupied country in neutral carriages, or on neutral hor&s;es.</P>
<P>A neutral &s;hip (&s;ays Rutherford in his in&s;titutes, who&s;e rea|&s;oning on this que&s;tion I adopt) may indeed be called a <HI>neutral place;</HI> but when we call it &s;o, the word <HI>place</HI> does not mean territory, it only means the thing in which the goods are con|tained. Though the goods of the enemy had been on board a &s;hip belonging to the enemy, we might have &s;aid, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that they were in a neutral place, if they had been lock|ed up there in a neutral che&s;t. But no one would imagine, that &s;uch a neutral place, as a che&s;t, can be con&s;idered as a part of the territory of the neutral &s;tate, or that it would protect the goods. Notwith&s;tanding, a neutral che&s;t is as much a neutral place as a neutral &s;hip.</P>
<P>A &s;hip, though a moveable thing, is under the juri&s;diction of a nation whil&s;t it continues in one of its ports&mdash;but as &s;oon as it is out at &s;ea, only the private owner&s;hip, or inferior do|minion, of the &s;hip remains, and it cea&s;es to be under the dominion or juri&s;diction of the nation. The ca&s;e will be the &s;ame, if, in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;hip to be the property of a merchant, we &s;uppo&s;e it to be the property of the nation.</P>
<P>For though we cannot well call the property which <HI>the nation</HI> has in &s;uch a &s;hip, by the name of private owner&s;hip: yet, when the &s;hip comes into the main ocean, the juri&s;diction or
<PB N="184" REF="028389_0760_0FD8EEDECBED4C88">paramount property cea&s;es, and the right that remains is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inferior kind of property, which has the nature of private owner&s;hip. If the juri&s;diction, which a neutral &s;tate has over the &s;hips of its members, or even over its own &s;hips, cea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> when the &s;hips are out at &s;ea; the goods of an enemy, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are on board &s;uch &s;hips, cannot be under the protection of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> nation, in the &s;ame manner as if the &s;hips had been in one of its ports, or as if the goods had been on its land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The juri&s;diction here &s;poken of is relative to property, and altogether di&s;tinct from what is termed per&s;onal juri&s;diction, which re&s;pects the relation between the &s;ociety and its members&mdash;This latter &s;pecies of juri&s;diction is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> confined to the territorial limits of a nation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding a neutral nation, when its &s;hip is in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> main ocean, has no juri&s;diction over the &s;hip it&s;elf, as if it was a part of its territory, yet the nation, or &s;ome of its member, which is the &s;ame thing, will continue to have the inferior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of property, or owner&s;hip in it. This &s;pecies of property will protect the &s;hip from capture, though the enemy's goods o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> board her may lawfully be taken.</P>
<P>But here a difficulty occurs&mdash;This inferior kind of property, called private owner&s;hip, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the juri&s;diction, over things, is an exclu&s;ive right; tho&s;e who have &s;uch owner|&s;hip in things, whether private or public per&s;ons, have a right to exclude all others from making u&s;e of &s;uch things; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this means, the rights of others are often hindered from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing effect.</P>

When I have merely a right to acquire property in a thing that is common to all mankind, but cannot do it without the u&s;e of what is already the property of &s;ome other man; this man neither does me an injury, nor encourages or pro|tects others who have injured me, by excluding me from the u&s;e of what belongs to him. But when we have a right in war, upon account of the damage which the enemy has done us, to take goods of the enemy, and the&s;e are in a neutral &s;hip: if the neutral &s;tate, though it has property in the &s;hip, &s;hould make u&s;e of its right of property to protect the goods again&s;t us, this protection makes it an acce&s;&s;ary to the injury, which is the foundation of the claim upon the enemy to obtain reparation of damages, and con&s;equently is incon&s;i&s;tent wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the notion of neutrality.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t this an&s;wer removes one difficulty, it brings ano|ther.

A law of nations, which is natural as to the matter of it, and po&s;itive only as to the objects of it, will furni&s;h an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Every &s;tate has, by univer&s;al acknowledgment and con&s;ent, by the law of nations, an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction over its own territory. As long, therefore, as a &s;tate keeps within its own territory, and exerci&s;es its juri&s;diction there, the protection its que&s;tion is not a violation of our rights&mdash;but when its &s;hips are in the main ocean; as they are then in a place out of its territory, where, by the law of nations, it has no juri&s;diction, this law will allow us to take notice of the protection, which it gives to the goods of an enemy, and to con&s;ider it as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce&s;&s;ary to the damages done by the enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> gives them protection.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the right of examination or &s;earch, if the end it lawful, and the examination or &s;earch a nece&s;&s;ary mean to attain this end, the inference is inevitable, that the examination or &s;earch i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likewi&s;e lawful.</P>
<P>If the que&s;tion, whether enemy goods are &s;eizable on board a neutral &s;hip, were really doubtful; yet the right to &s;earch neutral &s;hips mu&s;t be admitted for another rea&s;on. All agree that arms, ammunition and other contraband articles, may not be carried to an enemy by a neutral power&mdash;without &s;earching ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, &s;uch &s;upply could not be prevented. The right

<P>A nation may advance its intere&s;t perhaps by forming &s;uch a treaty, with one nation, and injure it by forming it with
<PB N="189" REF="028389_0765_0FD8EEEC126A7E28">another&mdash;Becau&s;e a nation has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, or for a limited time, formed &s;tipulations of this &s;ort, it cannot from thence be inferred, that it has thereby, in any &s;en&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed its con&s;ent to a total repeal of a law, the operation of which it has agreed to &s;u&s;pend only for a limited time, and in re&s;pect to a particular nation. Commercial treaties, in which we di&s;|cover the&s;e &s;tipulations, though not always, are commonly limited in their duration. This limitation is a &s;trong argument again&s;t the doctrine which the&s;e treaties are cited to e&s;tabli&s;h. For &s;o many years, &s;ay the parties, we will &s;u&s;pend the opera|tion of the law. When the treaty expires by its proper limita|tion, or is di&s;&s;olved by war, the rule of the treaty cea&s;es, and the law is again in force between the parties, and, pre&s;cribes to them, in common with other nations, their rights and duties in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The law of nations, that authorizes the capture of enemy goods in neutral &s;hips, requires the re&s;toration of neutral goods captured in enemy &s;hips: The treaties, which &s;tipulate that free &s;hips make free goods, &s;tipulate al&s;o that enemy &s;hips make enemy goods. I have di&s;covered no in&s;tance of the former &s;ti|pulation, that has not been accompanied by the latter: though I have found in&s;tances of the latter &s;tipulation unaccompanied by the former.&mdash;This is the ca&s;e in the treaty of peace, com|merce and alliance between Spain and England, concluded at Madrid in 1667. Tho&s;e, therefore, who contend that the law of nations has been repealed in one in&s;tance, mu&s;t al&s;o in&s;i&s;t that it has been repealed in the other.&mdash;If the number of &s;ti|pulations is to be received as evidence, the proof is &s;tronger of a repeal in the latter than in the former ca&s;e.&mdash;But will any one &s;eriou&s;ly maintain, that a nation would have a right to confi&s;|cate the goods of a neutral power found on board an enemy &s;hip, without an expre&s;s &s;tipulation on the part of &s;uch neu|tral &s;tate con&s;enting to the &s;ame?&mdash;Would England or Spain, for example, have a right to confi&s;cate American property captured in a French &s;hip? Would America <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">var, have a right to confi&s;cate the neutral property of Spain, Portugal, Denmark, or Ru&s;&s;ia, found on board an enemy &s;hip? Has any nation ever confi&s;cated property under this circum&s;tance? If not, the inference is clear, that the&s;e &s;tipulations are exclu&s;ively relative to the parties who form them, and that the rights of other &s;tates remain under the protection of the law of nations.</P>
<P>But according to Cato, this rea&s;oning may be ju&s;t, yet in|applicable; for he maintains that <HI>all nations</HI> have con&s;ented to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this conventional law. "As far back as 150 years," &s;ays this writer, "and ever &s;ince, I find that the com|mercial

<P>Struck with the fulne&s;s of this a&s;&s;ertion, I have carefully examined &s;uch collections of treaties, as I have been able to pro|cure, and going back to the year 1645, I have given a patient &s;earch to all the public conventions between Great Britain and the &s;everal powers of Europe &s;ince that period. I find, that &s;ince that epoch, Great Britain has concluded commercial trea|ties with Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, Danizie, Den|mark, Sweden, and Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>In the treaties with Holland and with France, &s;he has agreed to the &s;tipulation, that free &s;hips &s;hould make free goods, and enemy &s;hips, enemy goods.

Her treaties with Spain, Dantzie, Denmark, Sweden, and Ru&s;&s;ia, do neither of them contain this &s;tipulation. On the contrary, the 12th article of the treaty with Sweden, and the 20th of the treaty with Denmark, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of which is now in force, and has been &s;o for more than a cen|tury, as like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the 14th article of the treaty with Dantzie, declares, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> le&s;t the enemy's goods and merchandize &s;hould be conceabled under the di&s;gui&s;e of the goods of friends, it is &s;tipulated, that all &s;hips &s;hall be furni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;ports and certificates, by which it &s;hall be manife&s;t to whom the articles, compo&s;ing the cargoes, belong:" and the two fir&s;t of the&s;e trea|ties, moreover, declare it "to be injurious to protect the pro|perty of enemies," and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;pecial guards to prevent the &s;ame.</P>

But neither of the&s;e treaties con|tain any regulation relative to the manner of boarding neutral ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>This re&s;earch, though made with care, may have been im|perfect; the re&s;ult thereof is, that there are only two, po&s;&s;ibly three, of the&s;e eight nations, with whom Great Britain has ever agreed to the &s;tipulation, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods; only three of them with whom &s;he has &s;tipulated, that full credit &s;hall be given to pa&s;&s;ports or &s;hips' papers, or with whom the manner of boarding is &s;ettled. In&s;tead, therefore, of that uniformity and univer&s;ality in the &s;tipulations in the com|mercial treaties, concluded within the la&s;t 150 years, &s;o confi|dently a&s;&s;erted by Cato, we &s;ee that in five in&s;tances out of eight, of treaties concluded between Great Britain and the principal powers of Europe, within that term, they have on each of the&s;e points, given their &s;anction to a law directly in oppo&s;ition to the a&s;&s;ertion of this adventurous writer.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;ays Cato, "the principles of the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d neutrality, by the general con&s;ent of the great community of the civilized world, changed the law of nations."&mdash;It is a &s;ingular logic that proves the agreement of nations by their di&s;agreement, and their con&s;ent to a principle, by their drawing forth their fleet to di&s;pute it. The armed neutrality, with tho&s;e who under|&s;tand its hi&s;tory, will not be relied on by way of proving a change in the law of nations, brought about by univer&s;al con|&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="028389_0768_0FD8EEF20AF3FC50">
It will not be denied that this league, which was aimed prin|cipally again&s;t Great Britain, failed to accompli&s;h its purpo&s;e, and that it expired with the American war. Nothing has been heard of it during the pre&s;ent war; and it is notorious, that Ru&s;&s;ia, and Holland before its conque&s;t, were under agreements incompatible with the views of that a&s;&s;ociation. The northern powers of Europe under the countenance of France, united to &s;upport the principles of the armed neutrality; but the league did not include all the neutral powers; and of the powers en|gaged in the war, at that period, Spain con&s;ented to ob&s;erve the principles contended for by the confederacy, on condition that Great Britain would agree to them, who, &s;o far from agree|ing, openly re&s;i&s;ted them.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, by which it is contended that this a&s;&s;ociation introduced a new law of nations, might the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> leagues between certain nations to prohibit all commerce wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ever with an enemy, be appealed to in proof of an alteration of the law of nations in this re&s;pect.

<P>The objection that has ari&s;en from the di&s;&s;imilarity between this article and tho&s;e relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> treaties, is equally defective with tho&s;e already con&s;idered.

<P>The practice of France, of Holland, even &s;ub&s;equent to particular &s;tipulations, regulating this &s;ubject between them|&s;elves, has, in re&s;pect to other powers, been conformable to the law of nations&mdash;The ordinances and maritime deci&s;ions of France may be con&s;ulted to &s;how what her practice has been, and that of Holland is evident by the convention of 1689, be|tween her and England. The practice of Spain is under&s;tood to be the &s;ame; and in an in&s;tance that occurred during the Ame|rican war, &s;he carried the law to its utmo&s;t rigour, in a&s;&s;igning as a cau&s;e of condemnation of a neutral Tu&s;can &s;hip, her forcible re&s;i&s;tance of the right of &s;earch. Her capture of American

In re&s;pect to Great Britain, from the general notoriety of the fact, it &s;eems, in &s;ome &s;ort, unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that &s;he has immemorially adhered, in her general practice, to the law of nations in its wide&s;t interpreta|tion on this &s;ubject. In a few in&s;tances, and perhaps for &s;pe|cial rea&s;ons, as was the ca&s;e in re&s;pect to the treaty with Hol|land, concluded in 1667, &s;he has entered into oppo&s;ite &s;tipula|tions; but at this time, unle&s;s it may be with Portugal, Great Britain has no &s;uch treaty with any nation.</P>
<P>So undi&s;puted was the law on this &s;ubject, and &s;o uniform the practice of nations in ca&s;es, not governed by a conventional rule, that congre&s;s, in the commencement, and through the greater part of our revolution war, authorized our &s;hips of war and privateers, to capture enemy property on board neu|tral &s;hips, and our admiralty courts uniformly re&s;tored neutral property found on board enemy &s;hips. This practice continued years after the conclu&s;ion of our treaty with France, which contains a &s;tipulation, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, and enemy &s;hips enemy goods; no per&s;on, during that period, hav|ing &s;uppo&s;ed that thereby the law was altered in re&s;pect to other nations.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the war, to favor the views of the armed neutrality, in which league the United States were not a party, but who&s;e oppo&s;ition to Great Britain they naturally approved; congre&s;s, in an ordinance on the &s;ubject of captures, ordained that neutral bottoms &s;hould protect enemy goods&mdash;but here they &s;topped. Thus far the authority was indubitable, becau&s;e it was exerci&s;ed only in abridgment of their own rights. Being engaged in war, they could not by their own act, enlarge their rights, or abridge tho&s;e of neutral &s;hips; the extent of both being defined and &s;ettled by the public law of nations. They, therefore, never authorized the capture and condemna|tion of neutral goods found in enemy &s;hips, nor could they have authorized the &s;ame, without a manife&s;t violation of the rights of the neutral powers.</P>
<P>It is finally alleged that the article, if &s;ound in its principles, is defective in tho&s;e provi&s;ions which are requi&s;ite to protect and &s;ecure the neutral rights of the parties; ina&s;much as it does not contain an explicit &s;tipulation for the payment of freight on enemy goods, nor for the payment of damages for the deten|tion or lo&s;s of neutral &s;hips taken without ju&s;t cau&s;e.

<P>I RESUME the &s;ubject of the two la&s;t papers for the &s;ake of a few &s;upplementary ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The objections to the treaty, for not containing the principle, "that free &s;hips make free goods," as being the relinqui&s;hment of an advantage, which the modern law of nations gives to neutrals, have been fully examined, and, I flatter my&s;elf, com|pletely refuted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, add one or two re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ctions by way of fur|ther illu&s;tration. A pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of the law of nations, can only be changed by their <HI>common con&s;ent.</HI> This con&s;ent may either be expre&s;t, by treaties, declarations, &amp;c. adopting and promi&s;ing the ob&s;ervance of a different rule, or it may be im|plied, by a cour&s;e of practice or u&s;age. The con&s;ent, in either ca&s;e, mu&s;t embrace the great community of civilized nations. If to be inferred from treaties, it mu&s;t be &s;hown that they are uniform and univer&s;al. It can, at lea&s;t, never be inferred, while the treaties of different nations follow different rules, or the treaties between the &s;ame nation and others, vary from each other. So al&s;o as to u&s;age. It mu&s;t be uniform and uni|ver&s;al, and, let it be added, it mu&s;t be continued. A u&s;age adopted by &s;ome nations, and re&s;i&s;ted by others, or adopted by all temporarily and then di&s;continued, is in&s;ufficient to aboli&s;h an old, or &s;ub&s;titute a new rule of the law of nations. It has been demon&s;trated, that no con&s;ent of either de&s;cription has been given to the rule, which is contended for in oppo&s;ition to the treaty.</P>
<P>The armed neutrality, &s;o much quoted, is entirely deficient in the requi&s;ite characters. Its name imports that it was an armed combination of particular powers. It grew up in the mid&s;t of a war, and is under&s;tood to have been particularly levelled again&s;t one of the belligerent parties. It was re&s;i&s;ted by that power. There were other powers, which did not ac|cede to it. It is a recent tran&s;action, and has never acquired the confirmation of continued u&s;age. What is more, it has been virtually abandoned by &s;ome of the parties to it&mdash;and among
<PB N="196" REF="028389_0772_0FD8EEFC8E53C538">the&s;e, by the principal promoter of it, the politic and ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|pri&s;ing Catharine. It is, therefore, a perver&s;ion of all ju&s;t ideas, to a&s;cribe to &s;uch a combination the effect of altering a rule of the law of nations.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t important que&s;tions, it is remarkable that the op|po&s;ers of the truth are as much at variance with each other as they are with the truth they oppo&s;e. This was &s;trikingly exem|plified when the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States was under deliberation. The oppo&s;ition to it was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t incongruous materials&mdash;the &s;ame thing is ob&s;ervable in relation to the treaty.&mdash;And one in&s;tance of the contrariety applies to the rule cited above.</P>
<P>While &s;ome of the adver&s;aries of the teeaty complain of the admi&s;&s;ion of a contrary principle by that in&s;trument, as the abandonment of a rule of the pre&s;ent law of nations; others, conceding that there is no &s;uch rule yet e&s;tabli&s;hed, cen&s;ure that admi&s;&s;ion as a <HI>check</HI> to its <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>formal e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> and as a retrograde &s;tep from this de&s;irable point.</P>
<P>The objection in this form is more plau&s;ible than in the other, but it is not le&s;s de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;tance. If there has been any retrograde &s;tep, it was taken by the government prior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the treaty&mdash;authentic documents, which have been commu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|cated by the executive to congre&s;s, contain the evidence of this fact.</P>
<P>Early in the year 1793, &s;ome Briti&s;h crui&s;ers having &s;topped ve&s;&s;els of the United States, and taken out of them arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> which were the property of French citizens, Mr. Genet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then mini&s;ter of France, in a letter of the 9th of July of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> year, made a lively repre&s;entation upon the &s;ubject to our go|vernment, in&s;i&s;ting, in a &s;ub&s;equent letter of the 25th of that month, in which he recurs to the &s;ame point, that the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ples of neutrality e&s;tabli&s;hed, that friendly ve&s;&s;els make friends goods; and in effect, that the violation of this rule by Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Britain was a violation of our neutral rights, which we w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> bound to re&s;ent.</P>
<P>The reply of our government, is &s;een in a letter from ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecretary of &s;tate to that mini&s;ter, of the 24th of July&mdash;It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the&s;e terms&mdash;"I believe," &s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on, "It cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of nations, the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of a friend, found in the ve&s;&s;el of an enemy, are free, and the goods of an enemy, found in the ve&s;&s;el of a friend, are lawful prize. Upon this principle. I pre&s;ume, the Briti&s;h armed ve&s;|&s;els have taken the property of French citizens found in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ve&s;&s;els in the ca&s;es above mentioned; and, I confe&s;s, I &s;hould be at a lo&s;s on what principle to reclaim them. It is true that
<PB N="197" REF="028389_0773_0FD8EEFFC74A5D10">&s;undry nations, de&s;irous of avoiding the inconveniencies of hav|ing their ve&s;&s;els &s;topped at &s;ea, ran&s;acked, carried into port, and detained under pretence of having enemy goods on board, have, in many in&s;tances, introduced, by their &s;pecial treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms &s;hall make enemy goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain and lo&s;s; but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, controuling, in &s;pecial ca&s;es, the general principles of the law of nations, and, therefore, taking effect between &s;uch nations only as have &s;o agreed to controul it."</P>
<P>Nothing can be a more explicit or unequivocal abandonment of the rule, that free &s;hips make free goods, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> than is contained in this communication. But this is not all: In the letter, from Mr. Jeffer&s;on to our mini&s;ter in France, of the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1793, in&s;tructing him to urge the recall of Mr. Genet, the &s;ubject is re&s;umed, the po&s;ition a&s;&s;erted in an|&s;wer to Mr. Genet, in&s;i&s;ted upon anew, and enforced by addi|tional con&s;iderations: Among other &s;ugge&s;tions, we find the&s;e, "We &s;uppo&s;e it to have been long an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle of the law of nations, that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy's ve&s;&s;el, and an enemy's goods lawful prize in the ve&s;&s;el of a friend. The inconvenience of this principle has induced &s;everal nations latterly to &s;tipulate again&s;t it by treaty, and to &s;ub&s;titute another in its &s;tead, that free bottoms &s;hall make free goods, and enemy bottoms, enemy goods. We have introduced it into our treaties with France, Holland, and Ru&s;&s;ia; and French goods, found by the two latter nations in American bottoms, are not made prize of. It is our wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h it with other nations:&mdash;But this requires their con&s;ent al&s;o, is a work of time, and, in the mean while, they have a right to act on the general principle, without giving to us or to France, cau&s;e of complaint. Nor do I &s;ee, that France can lo&s;e by it on the whole&mdash;For though &s;he lo&s;es her goods, when found in our ve&s;&s;els, by the nations with whom we have no treaties&mdash;yet &s;he gains our goods when found in the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame and all other nations; and we believe the latter ma&s;s to be greater than the former."</P>
<P>Thus, then, &s;tood the bu&s;ine&s;s antecedent to the treaty. Great Britain, adhering to the principle of the general and long e&s;tabli&s;hed law of nations, captures French property in our ve&s;|&s;els, and leaves free our property in French ve&s;&s;els. We acqui|e&s;ce in this practice, without even a remon&s;trance or murmur. The French mini&s;ter complains of it, as contrary to the princi|ples of neutrality&mdash;We reply, that, in our opinion, it is not contrary to tho&s;e principles&mdash;that it is fully warranted by the
<PB N="198" REF="028389_0774_0FD8EF010577BFF0">general law of nations&mdash;that treaties, which e&s;tabli&s;h a different rule, are merely exceptions to that law, binding only on the contracting parties; that having no treaty of the &s;ort with Great Britain, we &s;hould be at lo&s;s on what ground to di&s;pute the legitimacy of her practice. We do not &s;imply forbear to op|po&s;e&mdash;We do not offer to France as an excu&s;e for our forbear|ance, that it is inconvenient to us, at the moment, to a&s;&s;ert a que&s;tionable right at the hazard of war&mdash;But we tell her pe|remptorily, that in our opinion, no &s;uch right exi&s;ts, and that the conduct of Great Britain, in the particular ca&s;e, is ju&s;tified by the law of nations&mdash;neither do we wrap the motive of our forbearance in &s;ilence, nor content our&s;elves with revealing it confidentially to France alone; but we publi&s;h it without re&s;erve to the world, and thus, in the pre&s;ence of Great Britain, and of every other nation, make a formal renunciation of the pre|ten&s;ion, that "free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, and enemy &s;hips enemy goods:" no counter declaration is heard from ei|ther hou&s;e of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to give a more full &s;anction to the oppo&s;ite principle than was given by this conduct, and the&s;e public and po&s;itive declarations of our government. It was impo&s;&s;ible more completely to abandon the favorite ground. It is puerile to at|tempt to di&s;criminate between the force of this &s;pecies of renunciation and that of an admi&s;&s;ion of its propriety by treaty. The conduct of a government avowed and explained, as in motives, by authentic public declarations, may a&s;&s;ert or renounce a preten&s;ion as effectually as its compacts&mdash;Every nation, with whom we had no contrary &s;tipulation, could &s;ay to us as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before as &s;ince the treaty with Great Britain, "your govern|ment has explicitly admitted that free &s;hips do not make free goods, and you have no right to complain of our not ob&s;erving that rule towards you." Candour, therefore, would oblige us to &s;ay that the treaty has left this point where it found it&mdash;that it has only not obtained from Great Britain a conce&s;&s;ion in fa|vor to e&s;tabli&s;h, but which cannot be claimed as matter of right. Though, therefore, it may not have the merit of &s;trengthening, it has not the demerit of weakening the ground.</P>
<P>The difference in our po&s;ition, in this re&s;pect, before and &s;ince the treaty, amounts to this, that before the treaty the go|vernment had abandoned the ground through one organ, Mr. Jeffer&s;on; by the treaty, it continued the abandonment through another organ, Mr. Jay&mdash;if we con&s;ider the organ as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|luntary cau&s;e in each ca&s;e, (the pre&s;umption of which is equally fair in both ca&s;es) and if there be any blame, it falls more hea|vily
<PB N="199" REF="028389_0775_0FD8EF0695C30F68">on Mr. Jeffer&s;on than on Mr. Jay; for the former founded and made the retreat, and the latter only did not advance from the di&s;advantageous po&s;t to which he had retreated. In other words, Mr. Jay did only not recover the ground which Mr. Jeffer&s;on had lo&s;t. And we know that, in general, it is a far more difficult ta&s;k to regain than to keep an advantageous po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>But, in truth, no blame can ju&s;tly be imputed in either ca&s;e. The law of nations was again&s;t the rule which it is de&s;ired to introduce. The United States could not have in&s;i&s;ted upon it as matter of right; and in point of policy it would have been madne&s;s in them to go to war, to &s;upport an innovation upon the pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed law. It was not honorable to claim a right, and &s;uffer it to be infracted without re&s;i&s;tance. It is not for young and weak nations to attempt to enforce novelties or preten&s;ions of equivocal validity. It is &s;till le&s;s proper for them to contend, at the hazard of their peace, again&s;t the clear right of others. The object was truly not of moment enough to ri&s;k much upon it. To u&s;e a French proverb, <HI>"The play was not worth the candle."</HI> In every view, therefore, it was wi&s;e to de&s;ert the preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>So al&s;o, in the mid&s;t of war, like that in which Great Bri|tain was engaged, it were prepo&s;terous to have expected, that &s;he would have acceded to a new rule, which, under the cir|cum&s;tances of her great maritime &s;uperiority, would have ope|rated &s;o much more conveniently to her enemy than to her&s;elf. And it would have been no le&s;s ab&s;urd to have made her acce&s;|&s;ion to that rule the <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of an arrangement, otherwi&s;e expedient. Here again <HI>the play would not have been worth the candle.</HI></P>
<P>The importance of the rule has artfully been very much mag|nified, to depreciate proportionably the treaty, for not e&s;tabli&s;h|ing it. It is to be remembered, that if &s;omething is gained by it, &s;omething is al&s;o given up. It depends on incalculable cir|cum&s;tances, whether, in a particular war, mo&s;t will be lo&s;t or gained. Yet the rule is, upon the whole, a convenient one to neutral powers. But it cannot be pretended that it is of &s;o great a value, as that the United States ought to adopt it as a maxim, never to make a treaty of commerce, in which it was not re|cognized. They might by this maxim forego the advantages of regulating their commercial intercour&s;e in time of peace with &s;everal foreign powers, with whom they have exten&s;ive relations of trade, by fixed and u&s;eful conventional rules, and &s;till re|main &s;ubject in time of war to the inconveniencies of not hav|ing
<PB N="200" REF="028389_0776_0FD8EFE762CEFAF0">e&s;tabli&s;hed, with tho&s;e powers, the principle to which they make that &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Though, therefore, it be a merit to a certain extent in a treaty to contain this principle, it is not a po&s;itive fault or blemi&s;h, that it does not contain it. The want of it is not a good cau&s;e of objection to a treaty otherwi&s;e eligible.</P>
<P>Let me add, too, in the &s;pirit of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter, that however it may be our wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h the rule with other nations be&s;ides tho&s;e with whom we have already done it, this requires their con&s;ent al&s;o, of cour&s;e their conviction, that it is their intere&s;t to con&s;ent; and that, con&s;idering the ob&s;tacles which lie in the way, the attainment of the object mu&s;t be <HI>"a work of time."</HI> It pre-&s;uppo&s;es, in &s;ome of the principal mari|time powers, a great change of ideas, which is not to be looked for very &s;uddenly. It was not, therefore, to have been expected of our envoy, that he was to have accompli&s;hed the point at &s;o premature and &s;o favorable a juncture.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ertion, that he has abandoned it, is made in too un|qualified a manner. For while he admits the operation for the pre&s;ent, of the general rule of the law of nations, he has, by the 12th article, engaged Great Britain in a &s;tipulation, that the parties will, at the expiration of two years after the exi&s;t|ing war, <HI>renew</HI> their <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>endeavour to agree</HI> whether in any, and what ca&s;es neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall protect enemy's property. It is true, it will be in the option of Great Britain then, to agree or not: but it is not le&s;s true that the principle is retained with con&s;ent of Great Britain in a <HI>negociable</HI> &s;tate. So far perhaps &s;ome ground has been retrieved.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, however, that I entertain much doubt as to the probability of a &s;peedy general e&s;tabli&s;hment of the rule, that friendly &s;hips &s;hall make friendly goods, and enemy &s;hips enemy goods. It is a rule again&s;t which, it is to be feared, the pre|ponderant maritime power, to whatever nation this character may belong, will be apt to &s;truggle with per&s;everance and effect, &s;ince it would tend to contract materially the means of that power to annoy and di&s;tre&s;s her enemies, who&s;e inferiority on the &s;ea would naturally cau&s;e their commerce, during war, to be carried on in neutral bottoms. This con&s;ideration will account for the re&s;i&s;tance of Great Britain to the principle, and for the endeavours of &s;ome other powers to promote it&mdash;and it de&s;erves notice, that her la&s;t treaty with France was &s;everely a&s;&s;ailed by &s;ome of the chiefs of oppo&s;ition, for containing a &s;tipulation in favor of that principle. The motive for con&s;enting to it, in this in&s;tance, probably was, that the &s;tipulation was likely to be rendered, in a great degree, nugatory by the relative &s;ituation
<PB N="201" REF="028389_0777_0FD8BEB01F139CB8">of the two nations, which, in almo&s;t any war in which one of the two was engaged on one &s;ide, would probably render the other a party on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>If the&s;e conjectures be right, there is a reflection which le&s;&s;ens much the value of &s;tipulations in favor of the rule; that &s;o long as one or more of the maritime powers di&s;avow it, there will be a &s;trong temptation to depart from a &s;crupulous ob|&s;ervance of &s;uch &s;tipulations, as we, in relation to France, have experienced in the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the arguments again&s;t the 17th article, for virtually admitting the right of &s;earch in time of war, the ob|jectors have had the temerity to cite the opinion of <HI>Vattel,</HI> as being oppo&s;ed to that right; and a mutilated quotation has given an appearance of truth to the a&s;&s;ertion. It has been heretofore &s;hown, by pa&s;&s;ages extracted from his work, that his opinion, &s;o far from denying explicitly, &s;upports the right to &s;earch. But it may be u&s;eful to examine the part of it which has been tortured into a contrary inference.</P>
<P>After affirming the right of &s;earch (B. 3. chap. 7, 8. 14) he proceeds thus, "but to avoid inconveniencies, violence, and every other irregularity, the manner of the &s;earch is &s;ettled in the treaties of navigation and commerce. According to the pre|&s;ent <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> credit is to be given to certificates and bills of lad|ing produced by the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip." Hence it is alleged the right to &s;earch is turned into the right of in&s;pecting the &s;hip's papers, which, being entitled to credit, are to preclude further &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>But what immediately follows, de&s;troys this conclu&s;ion! the words "unle&s;s any ground appear in them, or there be very good rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;pecting their validity," are &s;ubjoined to the clau&s;e ju&s;t quoted. This admits clearly, that the &s;hip's papers are not to be conclu&s;ive&mdash;But that, upon ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, the papers may be di&s;regarded, and the right of &s;earch may be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Who is to be the judge of the credit due to the papers and of the ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion? Manife&s;tly the officer of the belligerent party, who vi&s;its the neutral ve&s;&s;el. Then what does the whole amount to?&mdash;Merely this&mdash;That &s;hip's papers are entitled to a certain degree of re&s;pect and credit; how much, is left to the di&s;cretion of the officer of the belligerent party!&mdash;who, if he be not &s;atisfied of the fairne&s;s and validity of the papers, may proceed to their verification, by a more &s;trict and particular &s;earch, and then if he &s;till &s;ees, or &s;uppo&s;es he &s;ees, ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, he may carry the ve&s;&s;el into a port of his own country, for judicial inve&s;tigation&mdash;In doing this, he acts at his peril,
<PB N="202" REF="028389_0778_0FD8EF0A1BCB9DA8">and for an abu&s;e of his di&s;cretion expo&s;es him&s;elf to damages and other puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This is the true and evident &s;en&s;e of Vattel, and it agrees with the doctrine advocated in the&s;e papers, and, I will add, with the treaty under examination.</P>
<P>The 17th article admits, that the ve&s;&s;els of each party for <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;e</HI> of &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy contraband articles, may be cap|tured or detained, and carried to the neare&s;t and mo&s;t conve|nient port of the belligerent party, to the end that enemy's pro|perty and contraband articles on board may become lawful prize. But &s;o far from countenancing any proceeding without <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;e</HI> of &s;u&s;picon, or from exonerating the officer of the belligerent party from a re&s;pon&s;ibility for &s;uch proceeding, it leaves the law of nations, in this particular, in full force, and contemplating that &s;uch officer &s;hall be liable for damages, when he proceeds without <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;e</HI> of &s;u&s;picion, provides that all proper mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken to prevent delay in deciding the ca&s;es of &s;hips or cargoes brought in for adjudication, or in the <HI>payment or recovery of any indemnification adjudged or agreed to be paid to the ma&s;ters or owners of &s;uch &s;hips.</HI> Be&s;ides which, the 19th article &s;tipulates, in order that more abundant care may be taken for the &s;ecurity of the re&s;pective &s;ubjects and citizens of the contracting parties, and to prevent their &s;uffering injuries by the men of war and privateers of either party, that the command|ers of &s;hips of war and privateers, &s;hall forbear doing any da|mage to tho&s;e of the other party, committing any outrage again&s;t them; and that if they act to the contrary, <HI>they &s;hall be puni&s;hed,</HI> and &s;hall al&s;o be bound in their per&s;ons and e&s;tates, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> make &s;atisfaction and reparation for all damages, and the intere&s;t thereof, of whatever nature the &s;aid damages may be.</HI> And further, after e&s;tabli&s;hing that the commanders of privateers &s;hall, be|fore they are commi&s;&s;ioned, give &s;ecurity to &s;atisfy all damages and injuries, it adds, that in all ca&s;es of aggre&s;&s;ions their com|mi&s;&s;ions &s;hall be revoked and annulled.</P>
<P>The&s;e provi&s;ions not only conform to, and corroborate the injunctions of the laws of nations: but they refute the a&s;&s;ertion, that the treaty is altogether deficient in precautions for guard|ing neutral rights; &s;ince tho&s;e above-mentioned are among the mo&s;t efficacious.&mdash;It is not pre&s;umable that any &s;tipulations have been or can be made which will take away all di&s;cretion from the marine officers of the belligerent parties; for this would be a total &s;urrender of the rights of belligerent to neutral na|tions, and &s;o long as any di&s;cretion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, its right or wrong exerci&s;e will depend on the per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onal character of each officer:
<PB N="203" REF="028389_0779_0FD8EF0E8A6F91E0">and abu&s;es can only be re&s;trained by the penalties that await them. Tho&s;e &s;tipulations of treaties, then, which re-inforce the laws of nations as to the infliction of penalties, are the mo&s;t effectual of the precautions which treaties can adopt for the &s;ecurity of neutral rights; and in this particular the treaty with Great Britain is to the full as provident as our other treaties. In one point I believe it is more &s;o; for it expre&s;sly &s;tipulates a revocation of the commi&s;&s;ions of the commanders of privateers, for the aggre&s;&s;ions they may commit.</P>
<P>Is not the pa&s;&s;age la&s;t cited from Vattel a true commentary on tho&s;e &s;tipulations, for regulating and mitigating the right of &s;earch, which are found in our own and other treaties? Do they not all intend to re&s;erve to the belligerent party a right of judging of the validity and fidelity of the papers to be exhibited, and of extending the &s;earch or not, according to the circum|&s;tances of ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion which do or do not appear? and if this be their true con&s;truction, as it certainly is their con&s;truction in practice, which our own experience te&s;tifies, to what, after all, do they amount, more than without them the laws of nations, as univer&s;ally recognized, of them&s;elves pronounce? What real &s;ecurity do they afford more than the treaty with Great Britain affords?</P>
<P>It is much to be &s;u&s;pected, that there will always be found advantages e&s;&s;entially nominal, operating or not according to the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the neutral party; which, if &s;trong, will find abundant foundation in the acknowledged laws of nations on which to re&s;t the protection of its rights.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid to be ju&s;t matter of &s;urprize, that the&s;e pre|cautions &s;hould have no place in a treaty with Great Britain, who&s;e conduct on the &s;eas, &s;o particularly &s;ugge&s;ted and en|forced every guard to our rights that could be rea&s;onably in&s;i&s;ted on. Ob&s;ervations of this kind a&s;&s;ume con&s;tantly the &s;uppo&s;ition, that we had it in our power to fa&s;hion every provi&s;ion of the treaty exactly to our own ta&s;te, and that the ideas of the other contracting party were to have no influence even upon the mi|nor features of the contract. But this &s;uppo&s;ition is ab&s;urd; and a treaty may &s;till be entitled to our approbation, which adju&s;ts acceptably the great points of intere&s;t, though in &s;ome of its details it falls &s;hort of our de&s;ires. Nor can any well-in|formed man &s;incerely deny that it was to have been expected, that an adju&s;tment of the particulars in que&s;tion, would fall &s;hort of our ideas. It may be an&s;wered, that we were then at liberty not to make the treaty; &s;o we were; but does it follow that it would have been wi&s;e to &s;plit on &s;uch points?&mdash;upon a ju&s;t e&s;timate, their intrin&s;ic value is very moderate.</P>

<HEAD>No. XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE eighteenth article of the treaty, which regulates the &s;ubject of contraband, has been grievou&s;ly mi&s;repre|&s;ented; the objections u&s;ed again&s;t it with mo&s;t acrimony, are di&s;ingenuous and unfounded! Yet while I make this a&s;&s;ertion, which, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall be able to prove, I &s;hall not pre|tend to maintain that it is an article completely &s;atisfactory. I even admit that it has one unplea&s;ant ingredient in it, and I am convinced that our envoy mu&s;t have con&s;ented to it with re|luctance.</P>
<P>But while candour demands this conce&s;&s;ion, it equally admo|ni&s;hes us, that, under the circum&s;tances of the moment, the points in this re&s;pect to be adju&s;ted were peculiarly unmanage|able &mdash;that the po&s;ition of the other party rendered an arrange|ment, entirely agreeable to us, impracticable; that without compromi&s;e nothing could have been regulated; that the article made no change for the wor&s;e in our prior &s;ituation, but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome particulars made our ground better; and that e&s;timating truly the relative circum&s;tances of the parties, there is no pro|bability that any thing more acceptable could have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I will add, that a degree of imperfection, which may fairly be attributed to this article, is far from being of &s;uch im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ance, as, on &s;olid calculations, ought to defeat the treaty&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> clear right is abandoned, no material intere&s;t of the nation injured.</P>
<P>It is one thing, whether every part of the treaty be &s;atisfac|tory &mdash;another, and a very different thing, whether in the ag|gregate it be eligible or not, and ought to be accepted or re|jected. Nations could never make contracts with one another, if each were to require that every part of it &s;hould be adju&s;ted by its own &s;tandard of right and expediency. The true que&s;|tion always is upon the collective merits of the in&s;trument; whether, upon the whole, it rea&s;onably accommodates the opinions and intere&s;ts of the parties. Tried by this te&s;t, the treaty negociated with Great Britain, fully ju&s;tifies the accept|ance of it by the con&s;tituted authorities of our country, and claims the acquie&s;cence of every good citizen.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t laboured, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t fal&s;e of the charges again&s;t the eighteenth article is, that it allows p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|vi&s;ions to be contraband in ca&s;es not heretofore warranted by the laws of nations, and refers to the belligerent party, the deci&s;ion of what tho&s;e ca&s;es are.&mdash;This is the general form of
<PB N="205" REF="028389_0781_0FD8EF1398041DF8">the charge. The draft of a petition to the legi&s;lature of Virgi|nia, reduces it to this &s;hape. The treaty "<HI>expre&s;sly</HI> admits, that provi&s;ions are to be held contraband in ca&s;es other than when bound to an inve&s;ted place, and <HI>impliedly</HI> admits, that &s;uch ca&s;es exi&s;t at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a palpable untruth, which may be detected by a bare peru&s;al of the article.&mdash;The la&s;t is an untrue inference, impregnated with the malignant in&s;inuation that there was a de&s;ign to &s;anction the unwarrantable preten&s;ion of a right to inflict famine on a whole nation.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to an analy&s;is of the article, let us review the prior &s;ituation of the parties. Great Britain, it is known, had taken and acted upon the ground, that &s;he had a right to &s;top and detain, on payment for them, provi&s;ions belonging to neutrals, going to the dominions of France. For this violent and impolitic mea&s;ure, which the final opinion of mankind will certainly condemn, &s;he found colour, in the &s;ayings of &s;ome writers of reputation, on public laws.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age of this kind, from Vattel, has been more than once quoted, in the&s;e terms, "Commodities, particularly u&s;ed in war, and the importation of which, to an enemy, is prohi|bited, are called <HI>contraband</HI> goods. Such are military and naval &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res timber, hor&s;es, and <HI>even provi&s;ions in certain junctures, when there are hopes of reducing the enemy by famine.</HI>" Heine|cius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law of nature and nations.

I. and V. 3. Chap. I. and X.</NOTE></P>
<P>The United States, with rea&s;on, di&s;puted this con&s;truction of the law of nations! re&s;training the general propo&s;itions which appear to favor it, to tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the chance of reducing by famine was <HI>manife&s;ted</HI> and <HI>palpable,</HI> &s;uch as the ca&s;es of particular places, bona fide, be&s;ieged, blockaded or in|ve&s;ted. The government accordingly remon&s;trated again&s;t the proceeding of Great Britain, and made every effort again&s;t it which prudence, in the then po&s;ture of affairs, would permit. The order for &s;eizing provi&s;ions, was, after a time, revoked.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate our envoy found the bu&s;ine&s;s, pending the very war in which Great Britain had exerci&s;ed the preten&s;ion, with the &s;ame admini&s;tration which had done it, was it to have been expected that &s;he would, in a treaty with us, even virtually or impliedly have acknowledged the inju&s;tice or impropriety of the conduct? Here was no e&s;cape, as in the in&s;tance of the
<PB N="206" REF="028389_0782_0FD8EF16110D6AE0">order of the 6th of November, 1793, in the mi&s;conceptions of her officers. The que&s;tion was to condemn a deliberate and un|ambiguous act of the admini&s;tration it&s;elf. The pride, the reputation, and the intere&s;t of that admini&s;tration forbade it.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide, to admit the preten&s;ions of Great Britain was &s;till more impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;We had every inducement of character, right, and intere&s;t again&s;t it. What was the natural and only i&s;&s;ue out of this embarra&s;&s;ment? Plainly, to leave the point un&s;ettled; to get rid of it; to let it remain &s;ub&s;tantially where it was before the treaty. This, I have good ground to believe, was the real under&s;tanding of the two negociators; and the article has fulfilled that view.</P>
<P>After enumerating &s;pecifically what articles &s;hall be deemed contraband, it proceeds thus, "And whereas the difficulty of <HI>agreeing</HI> on the <HI>preci&s;e ca&s;es,</HI> in which alone <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>other articles,</HI> not generally contraband, may be regarded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniencies and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e: It is further agreed, that whenever any &s;uch articles, &s;o becoming contra|band <HI>according to the laws of nations,</HI> &s;hall, for that rea&s;on, be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall <HI>not be confi&s;cated,</HI> but the owners thereof &s;hall be <HI>&s;peedily</HI> and <HI>completely indemnified;</HI> and the captors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in their default, the government under who&s;e authority they act, &s;hall pay to the ma&s;ters or owners of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> value of all articles with a rea&s;onable mercantile profit the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> together with the freight and al&s;o the demurrage, incident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch detention."</P>
<P>The difficulty of agreeing on the preci&s;e ca&s;es in which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cles, not generally contraband, become &s;o, from particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cum&s;tances, is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igned as the motive to the &s;tipula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> which follows.&mdash;This excludes the &s;uppo&s;ition that any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whatever were intended to be admitted or agreed. But this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ficulty rendered it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|cies and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e&mdash;a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;ion, with this view, is, therefore, made, which is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> liberal compen&s;ation for the articles taken&mdash;The evident in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of this provi&s;ion is, that in <HI>doubtful</HI> ca&s;es, the inconvenienci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to the neutral party being obviated or le&s;&s;ened by compen&s;ation there may be the le&s;s cau&s;e of temptation to controver&s;y and rupture&mdash;the affair may be the more &s;u&s;ceptible of negociation and accommodation. More than this cannot be pretended; be|cau&s;e it is further agreed, "that whenever any &s;uch articles, &s;o become contraband, <HI>according to the exi&s;ting laws of nations,</HI> &s;hall, for that rea&s;on, be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be confi&s;|cated,
<PB N="207" REF="028389_0783_0FD8EF1826F64610">but the owners thereof &s;hall be &s;peedily and completely indemnified," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>criterion</HI> of the ca&s;es, in which articles, not gene|rally contraband, may, from particular circum&s;tances, become &s;o, is expre&s;sly the <HI>exi&s;ting law of nations;</HI> in other words, the law of nations at the time the tran&s;action happens. When the&s;e laws pronounce them contraband, they may, for that rea|&s;on, be &s;eized; when otherwi&s;e, they may not be &s;eized. Each party is as free as the other to decide whether the laws of nations do, in the given ca&s;e, pronounce them contraband or not, and neither is obliged to be governed by the opinion of the other. If one party, on a fal&s;e pretext of being authorized by the laws of nations, makes a &s;eizure, the other is at full liberty to conte&s;t it, to appeal to tho&s;e laws, and, if it thinks fit, to op|po&s;e, even to repri&s;als and war. This is the expre&s;s tenor of the provi&s;ion&mdash;there is nothing to the contrary; nothing that nar|rows the ground; nothing that warrants either party in mak|ing a &s;eizure, which the laws of nations, independent of the treaty, permits; nothing which obliges either party to &s;ubmit to one, when it is of opinion the law of nations has been vio|lated by it.</P>
<P>But as liberal compen&s;ation is to be made in every ca&s;e of &s;eizure, whereof difference of opinion happens, it will become a que&s;tion of prudence and expediency, whether to be &s;atis|fied with the compen&s;ation, or to &s;eek further redre&s;s. The provi&s;ion will, in doubtful ca&s;es, render an accommodation of opinion the more ea&s;y, and, as a circum&s;tance conducing to the pre&s;ervation of peace, is a valuable ingredient in the treaty. A very different phra&s;eology was to have been expected, if the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ention had been, to leave each party at liberty to &s;eize, agree|ably to its own opinion of the law of nations, upon the condi|tion of making compen&s;ation&mdash;The &s;tipulation would thus have been: "It is agreed, that whenever either of the contract|ing parties &s;hall &s;eize any &s;uch articles &s;o <HI>becoming</HI> contraband, and which &s;hall, for that rea&s;on, be &s;eized;" this makes, not the opinion of either party, but the fact of the articles having <HI>become</HI> contraband by the laws of nations, the condition of the &s;ei|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re.</P>
<P>A cavil has ari&s;en on the term <HI>"exi&s;ting,"</HI> as if it had the effect of enabling one of the parties to make a law of nations for the occa&s;ion. But this is a mere cavil.</P>
<P>No one nation can make a law of nations; no po&s;itive regu|lation of one &s;tate, or of a partial nomination of &s;tates, can pre|tend to this character. A law of nations is a law which na|ture, agreement, or u&s;age has e&s;tabli&s;hed between nations; as
<PB N="208" REF="028389_0784_0FD8EF19203F7670">this may vary from one period to another by agreement or u&s;age, the article very properly u&s;es the term "exi&s;ting," to denote that law, which at the time the tran&s;action may happen, &s;hall be then the law of nations. This is a plain and obvious u&s;e of the term, which nothing but a &s;pirit of mi&s;repre&s;entation could have perverted to a different meaning.</P>
<P>The argument again&s;t the foregoing con&s;truction is in &s;ub|&s;tance this (viz.) it is now a &s;ettled doctrine of the law of na|tions, that provi&s;ions and other articles, not generally contra|band, can only become &s;o when going to a place be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted&mdash;ca&s;es of this kind are fully provided for in a &s;ub&s;equent part of the article; the implication therefore is, that &s;omething more was intended to be embraced in the ante|cedent part.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t examine the fact, whether all the ca&s;es of that kind are comprehended in the &s;ub&s;equent part of the article. I &s;ay they are not&mdash;the remaining clau&s;e of the article divides it&s;elf into two parts. The fir&s;t de&s;cribes the ca&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el &s;ail|ing for a port or place belonging to any enemy, without know|ing that the &s;ame is either be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted; and provides, that, in &s;uch ca&s;e, the ve&s;&s;el may be turned away, but not detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, confi&s;cated, unle&s;s after not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce &s;he &s;hall again attempt to enter: The &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efer bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ca&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el, or goods, which had entered into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> or place before it was be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ares that the one or the other &s;hall not be liable to confi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, but &s;hall be re&s;tored to the owners thereof. The&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only ca&s;es de&s;cribed or provided for. A third, which occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> on the &s;lighte&s;t reflection, is not mentioned: the ca&s;e of a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;el going to a port or place which is be&s;ieged, blockaded or in|ve&s;ted, with notice of its being in that &s;tate when &s;he com|mences her voyage, or previous to her receiving notice from the be&s;ieging, blockading, or inve&s;ting party. This is left to the operation of the general law of nations, except &s;o far as it may be affected in re&s;pect to compen&s;ation by the antecedent clau&s;e. Thus the fact, which is the foundation of the argument, fails, and with it, of cour&s;e, the argument it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But had this been otherwi&s;e, the conclu&s;ion would &s;till have been erroneous&mdash;the two clau&s;es are entirely independent of each other, and though they might both contemplate the &s;ame ca&s;es in whole, or in part, they do it with an eye to very dif|ferent purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The object of the fir&s;t is to le&s;&s;en the danger of mi&s;under|&s;tanding, by e&s;tabli&s;hing this general rule, that wherever articles, not commonly contraband, become &s;o from particular circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="209" REF="028389_0785_0FD8EF1A93179A90">according to the law of nations, they &s;hall &s;till not be confi&s;cated, but, when &s;eized, the owners of them &s;hall be in|demnified.</P>
<P>The object of the la&s;t is to regulate &s;ome &s;pecial con&s;e|quences with regard to ve&s;&s;els and goods going to, or which had previou&s;ly gone to places be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted; and in re&s;pect to which the di&s;po&s;itions of the laws of nations may have been deemed doubtful or too rigorous. Thus it is held, that the laws of nations permit the confi&s;cation of &s;hips and goods going to places be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted; but this clau&s;e decides, that if going without notice, &s;o far from being confi&s;cated, they &s;hall not even be detained, but &s;hall be permitted to go wither&s;oever they plea&s;e. If they per&s;i&s;t after notice, then the contumacy &s;hall be puni&s;hed with confi&s;cation. In both in&s;tances the con&s;equence is entirely different from every thing in the antecedent clau&s;e.</P>
<P>There, there is &s;eizure, with compen&s;ation. Here, in one in&s;tance, &s;eizure is forbidden, and permi&s;&s;ion to go el&s;ewhere is enjoined. In the other in&s;tances, the offending things are con|fi&s;cated, which excludes the idea of compen&s;ation. Again, the la&s;t part of the la&s;t clau&s;e &s;tipulates in the ca&s;e, which it &s;up|po&s;es, the re&s;toration of the property to its owners, and &s;o ex|cludes both &s;eizure and compen&s;ation. Hence it is apparent the objects of the two clau&s;es are entirely foreign to each other, and that no argument nor inference whatever can be drawn from the one to the other.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, what other ca&s;es there can be, except tho&s;e of places be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted? and if none other, what difficulty in defining them? why leave the point &s;o vague and indeterminate? One an&s;wer, which indeed has already been given in &s;ub&s;tance, is, that the &s;ituation of one of the parties prevented an agreement at the time; that not being able to agree, they could not define; and the alternative was to avoid definition&mdash;The want of definition only argues want of agreement. It is &s;trange logic to a&s;&s;ert, that this or that is ad|mitted, becau&s;e nothing is defined.</P>
<P>Another an&s;wer is, that even if the parties had been agreed that there were no other ca&s;es than tho&s;e of be&s;ieged, block|aded, or inve&s;ted places, &s;till there would have remained much room for di&s;pute about the preci&s;e ca&s;es, owing to the imprac|ticability of defining what is a be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted place. About this there has been frequent controver&s;y; and the fact is &s;o complicated, puts on &s;uch a variety of &s;hapes, that no definition can well be devi&s;ed, which will &s;uit all. Thence na|tions, in their compacts with each other, frequently do not
<PB N="210" REF="028389_0786_0FD8EF1DDAEF4F38">attempt one; and where the attempt has been made, it has left almo&s;t as much room for di&s;pute about the definition as there was about the thing.</P>
<P>Moreover, is it impo&s;&s;ible to conceive other ca&s;es than tho&s;e mentioned above, in which provi&s;ions and other articles not generally contraband might, on rational grounds, be deemed &s;o? What if they were going expre&s;sly, and with notice, to a be&s;ieging army, whereby it might obtain a &s;upply e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of its operations? Is there no doubt that it would be ju&s;tifiable in &s;uch ca&s;e to &s;eize them? Can the liberty of trade be &s;aid to apply to any in&s;tance of direct and immediate aid to a military expedition? It would be at lea&s;t a &s;ingular effect of the rule, if provi&s;ions could be carried without inter|ruption for the &s;upply of a Spani&s;h army be&s;ieging Gibra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, when, if de&s;tined for the &s;upply of the garri&s;on in that place, they might, of right, be &s;eized by a Spani&s;h fleet.</P>
<P>The calumniators of the article have not had the candour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notice that it is not confined to provi&s;ions, but &s;peaks of provi|&s;ions and other articles.

<P>THE cour&s;e thus far pur&s;ued in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the 18th article, has inverted the order of it, as it &s;tands in the treaty. It is compo&s;ed of three clau&s;es; the two la&s;t of which have been fir&s;t examined&mdash;I thought it advi&s;eable, in the out&s;et, to di&s;po&s;e of an objection which has been the principal &s;ource of clamour.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t clau&s;e of that which remains to be examined, enu|merates the articles, which, it is agreed, &s;hall be deemed contra|band of war. The&s;e are, "all arms, and implements &s;erving for the purpo&s;e of war, &s;uch as cannon, mu&s;quets, mortars, pe|tards, bombs, grenadoes, carca&s;es, &s;auci&s;&s;es, carriages for can|non, mu&s;quet-re&s;ts, bandoliers, gunpowder, match, &s;alt-petre, balls, pikes, &s;words, head-pieces, cuira&s;&s;es, halberts, lances, javelins, hor&s;e furniture, hol&s;ters, belts, and generally all other implements of war; as al&s;o timber for &s;hip-building, tar or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, un|wrought iron and fir planks only excepted."</P>
<P>All which articles are declared to be ju&s;t objects of confi&s;ca|tion, when attempted to be carried to any enemy of either party.</P>
<P>It is well under&s;tood, that war abridges the liberty of trade of neutral nations; and that it is not lawful for them to &s;upply either of two belligerent parties with any article deemed con|traband of war; nor may they &s;upply any article whatever to a
<PB N="212" REF="028389_0788_0FD8EF22346F08E0">place be&s;ieged, blockaded or inve&s;ted. The former ca&s;e includes a &s;pecial catalogue of articles which have an immediate refer|ence to war&mdash;The latter extends to all kinds of goods and merchandize. The penalty in both ca&s;es is confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>The&s;e po&s;itions have not been di&s;puted. The only que&s;tion which has been or can be rai&s;ed, mu&s;t re&s;pect the enumeration of the articles which are to be con&s;idered as contraband.</P>
<P>In comparing the enumeration in the pre&s;ent treaty, with that of our former treaties, we find the differences to be the&s;e. Our former treaties include <HI>"hor&s;es,"</HI> and one of them "&s;ol|diers," which our pre&s;ent does not; but our pre&s;ent includes "timber for &s;hip-building, tar or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;aid, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted," which are not to be found in our former treaties.</P>
<P>It is alleged that the including of the&s;e articles is an exten|tion of the li&s;t of contraband beyond the limit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> law of nations; in &s;upport of which allegation, it is affirmed, that they have been excluded by the uniform tenor of the trea|ties which have been formed for more than a century pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Though this po&s;ition will not, upon careful examination, ap|pear correct; yet it is &s;o far founded, as to claim an acknow|ledgment, that the article under con&s;ideration has, in this in|&s;tance, pur&s;ued the <HI>rigor</HI> of the law of nations. It was to this, I alluded, when I ob&s;erved that it contained one unplea&s;ant ingredient.</P>
<P>It is a fact, that far the greater proportion of modern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ties exclude naval &s;tores or articles for &s;hip-building; yet this is not univer&s;ally the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>By the third article of the treaty of alliance and comment between Great Britain and Denmark, in 1670, the parties agree "not to furni&s;h the enemies of each other with any provi&s;ions of war, as &s;oldiers, arms, engines, guns, &s;hips or other nece&s;&s;aries for the u&s;e of war, nor to &s;uffer the &s;ame to be furni&s;hed by their &s;ubjects." An explanation of this article was made by a convention, dated the 4th of July, 1780, which, after enumerating as contraband, the u&s;ual catalogue of military implements, adds, in the preci&s;e terms of our arti|cle, "as al&s;o timber for &s;hip-building, tar, ro&s;in, copper i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron, and fir planks only excepted."</P>
<P>In a &s;eries of treaties between Great Britain and Portugal, down to the year 1703, I do not di&s;cover that there has ever
<PB N="213" REF="028389_0789_0FD8EF2389D29278">been a regulation of the articles which are to be treated as contraband, between the&s;e powers.</P>
<P>And between Sweden and Great Britain, the 11th article of a treaty, entered into in 1661 (and &s;till in force unaltered, though a &s;ub&s;equent commercial treaty was made between the&s;e powers as late as 1776) &s;ubjects to confi&s;cation equally all articles called <HI>contraband,</HI> and <HI>e&s;pecially money, provi&s;ions, &amp;c.</HI> The &s;pecification not being complete, naval &s;tores are left upon the open ground of the law of nations; but money and pro|vi&s;ions are &s;uperadded&mdash;This latitude would bear little doubt as to the intention to include naval &s;tores.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An opinion has been propagated that Sweden armed in concert with Den|mark, in order to maintain the neutral right of carrying corn and flour to France, in oppo&s;ition to the convention of March, 1793, between Great Bri|tain and Ru&s;&s;ia; and that, in con&s;equence of this proceeding, the remon&s;trances of the&s;e powers have proved more &s;ucce&s;sful than we have been in obtaining &s;atisfaction from Great Britain.
<P>This opinion is throughout, an error, made, u&s;e of by tho&s;e who&s;e per&s;evering aim has been, by &s;ilencing truth, rea&s;on, and moderation, and inflaming the angry pa&s;&s;ions of the community, to <HI>involve</HI> the country in anarchy and war.&mdash;The authors of this impo&s;ture, as well as the exalted patriots who have &s;een in the memorial of our envoy, the humiliation of our country, are referred to a "col|lection of &s;tate papers relative to the war again&s;t France," publi&s;hed by Debret, in 1794. The peru&s;al of the Swedi&s;h &s;tate papers; as well as the memorials of the able and prudent B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn&s;tor&s;&s;, may teach the&s;e gentlemen a little of what is deemed good manners on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>So far from even remon&s;trating, much le&s;s arming on account of the Briti&s;h in&s;truction of June, 1793, when that order was notified at Stockholm, by the Briti&s;h re&s;ident there, the government of Sweden, by their re&s;ident at London, acknowledged, in terms too re&s;pectful to be repeated in the hearing of our ex|clu&s;ive patriots, that Sweden was perfectly &s;atisfied with the in&s;truction; &s;ince, in&s;tead of payment, which the order in&s;urred, all provi&s;ions, in virtue of an ex|i&s;ting treaty between the two nations, were liable to confi&s;cation when &s;eized, on their way to an enemy.</P>
<P>This note is added for the purpo&s;e of refuting a popular error, and not to vindicate the in&s;truction alluded to, which I con&s;ider as an injury to the rights of neutral nations, that has not been ju&s;tified by the an&s;wers th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> have been given by Great Britain to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>It appears from the&s;e &s;pecimens, that there is not a perfect uniformity in the conventions between nations; and that no purely po&s;itive law of nations can be deduced from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>If we call to our aid the principles of rea&s;on and natural ju&s;tice, which are the great foundations of the law of nations, we &s;hall not di&s;cover, in this in&s;tance, <HI>data</HI> as certain as could be wi&s;hed, for a &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion; and the &s;ounde&s;t determi|nation, which we can adopt, will be, that beyond a certain point, the que&s;tion is in a great degree arbitrary, and mu&s;t depend materially upon conventional regulation between nation and
<PB N="214" REF="028389_0790_0FD8EF2993D535A0">nation.&mdash;Hence it is there is &s;o great a diver&s;ity in the &s;tipula|tions of different parties on this point; indicating that there is no ab&s;olute rule. Hence al&s;o it is, that &s;everal nations, at dif|ferent times, being at war, have thought them&s;elves authorized to regulate and announce, by public declarations, the article which they would con&s;ider and treat as contraband.</P>
<P>The opinion of writers will be found to &s;upport the article as it &s;tands, in the particular, which is now the &s;ubject of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Vattel,</HI> we have before &s;een, (B. B. C. 3. 6, 7. &s;. 112) expre&s;sly ranks <HI>naval &s;tores</HI> and <HI>timber</HI> under the denomination of con|traband goods.</P>

X. page 80.</NOTE> and he afterwards cites, with approbation, &s;everal edicts or proclamations, which the &s;tates general, in different wars with different nations, have publi&s;hed, declaring tho&s;e articles contraband&mdash;thus referring it to the belligerent party to judge of, and pronounce the ca&s;es when they may right|fully be deemed &s;o&mdash;And the &s;ame idea &s;eems to have been adopted by <HI>Grotius</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">B. iii.

<P>Grotius, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this que&s;tion, divides goods into three cla&s;&s;es,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Tho&s;e which are of u&s;e only in war, as arms, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Tho&s;e which &s;erve only for plea&s;ure;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Tho&s;e u&s;eful for peaceable as well as for warlike purpo&s;es, "as money, <HI>provi&s;ions,</HI> &s;hips and <HI>naval &s;tores"</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
&mdash;concerning which he argues in &s;ub|&s;tance, that the fir&s;t cla&s;s are clearly contraband; that the &s;e|cond cla&s;s are clearly not contraband; and that the third cla&s;s may or may not be &s;o, according to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the war; alleging, that <HI>if nece&s;&s;ary to our defence, they may be intercepted,</HI> but upon condition of re&s;titution, unle&s;s there be
<PB N="215" REF="028389_0791_0FD8EF2996C7C1B0">ju&s;t cau&s;e to the contrary; which ju&s;t cau&s;e is explained by the examples of &s;ending them to a be&s;ieged, or blockaded place.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning about the third cla&s;s has a very inconvenient latitude. It &s;ubjects the trade of neutral nations too exten&s;ively to the di&s;cretion of belligerent powers; and yet there is a &s;eri|ous embarra&s;&s;ment about drawing the true line, one which will duly conciliate the &s;afety of the belligerent, with that of the neutral, party.</P>
<P>What definition of contraband, con&s;ulting rea&s;on alone, &s;hall we adopt? Shall we &s;ay, that none but articles peculiar to war ought to receive this denomination? But is even powder <HI>exclu&s;ively applicable</HI> to war? Are nitre and &s;ulphur, its chief ingredients, <HI>peculiar</HI> to war? Are they not all u&s;eful for other purpo&s;es; &s;ome of them in medicine, and other important arts? Shall we &s;ay, that none but articles prepared and organ|ized for war, as their primary object, ought to have that charac|ter? But what &s;ub&s;tantial difference can rea&s;on know, between the &s;upply to our enemy of powder, and that of &s;ulphur and &s;alt-petre, the ea&s;ily convertible materials of this mi&s;chievous compound?</P>
<P>How would either of the&s;e definitions, or any other, comport with what tho&s;e of our treaties which are thought unexception|able, in this particular, have regulated, or with what is com|mon in the treaties between other nations? Under which of them &s;hall we bring hor&s;es and their furniture?</P>
<P>If we &s;ay, that in wars by land, the&s;e are in&s;truments little le&s;s important than men, and, for that rea&s;on, ought to be comprehended; it may be a&s;ked in return, what can be more nece&s;&s;ary in wars by &s;ea, than the materials of &s;hips, and why &s;hould they not, for the like rea&s;ons, be equally comprehended?</P>
<P>In wars between maritime nations, who transfer its calami|ties from the land to the ocean, and wage their mo&s;t furious conflicts on that element, who&s;e dominions cannot be attacked or defended without a &s;uperiority in naval &s;trength, who more|over po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es di&s;tant territories, the protection and commercial advantages of which, depend upon the exi&s;tence and &s;upport of navies, it is difficult to maintain, that it is again&s;t rea&s;on, or again&s;t tho&s;e principles which regulate the de&s;cription of con|traband, to con&s;ider as &s;uch the materials which appertain to the con&s;truction and equipment of &s;hips.</P>
<P>It is not a &s;ufficient objection, that the&s;e articles are u&s;eful for other purpo&s;es, and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of maritime com|merce&mdash;Hor&s;es are of primary utility in agriculture; and it has been &s;een that there are other articles indi&s;putably on the
<PB N="216" REF="028389_0792_0FD8EF2B6969C6B0">li&s;t of contraband, which are entirely within the principle of that objection.</P>
<P>Rutherforth, a &s;en&s;ible modern writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutes of Natural Law, book II. chap. x. xix.</NOTE> after truly ob&s;erv|ing, "that the notion of contraband goods is of &s;ome latitude, &s;o that it is not ea&s;y preci&s;ely to determine what are and what are not of this &s;ort&mdash;that all <HI>warlike &s;tores</HI> are certainly contra|band, but that &s;till the que&s;tion returns, what are to be reckoned warlike &s;tores?"&mdash;after noticing the divi&s;ion of articles by Gro|tius and the difficulties with regard to the third cla&s;s&mdash;draws this conclu&s;ion, that "where a war <HI>is carried on by &s;ea</HI> as well as by land, not only &s;hips of war which are already built, but the materials for building or repairing of &s;hips, will come un|der the notion of <HI>warlike &s;tores.</HI>" This is a preci&s;e idea, and, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, on principle, not an irrational one.</P>
<P>If we re&s;ort to the opinions which have been entertained and evidenced in our own country, they will be found to have given great extent to the idea of contraband&mdash;Congre&s;s, by an act of May the 3th, 1777, e&s;tabli&s;hing the form of commi&s;&s;ions for privateers, authorize them "to attack, &s;ubdue, and take all &s;hips and other ve&s;&s;els whatever, carrying &s;oldiers, arms, gun|powder, ammunition, <HI>provi&s;ions,</HI> or any other contraband goods, to any of the Briti&s;h armies or &s;hips of war, employed again&s;t the United States. And in their act of the 27th of November, 1780, acceding, in part, to the rule of the armed neutrality, they declare, that contraband &s;hall be thereafter <HI>confined</HI> to the articles contained under this character, in our treaty with France; indicating, by this, their opinion that the li&s;t of tho&s;e articles is abridged by that treaty. If the fir&s;t mentioned act was well founded (and there are &s;trong rea&s;ons for it) it e&s;ta|bli&s;hes that even provi&s;ions may be contraband, if going directly to invading fleets and armies; which affords an in&s;tance of their being &s;o (analogous to be ca&s;e heretofore put of a be&s;ieging army) in addition, to the ca&s;es of places be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted. And as to naval &s;tores, I a&s;&s;ert a belief, that the common opinion of tho&s;e per&s;ons in this country, who&s;e con|templation had embraced the &s;ubject, included them in the ca|talogue of contraband.</P>

<P>CAMILLUS, and all tho&s;e who have preceded him, in con&s;idering the &s;econd article of the treaty, a&s;&s;ert that it <HI>accompli&s;hes</HI> a primary object of the envoy's mi&s;&s;ion, and one of great importance to the United States. He then details, at &s;ome length, the important advantages which mu&s;t re&s;ult from an acqui&s;ition of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. Although there be nothing new in the&s;e details, I am glad he has gone into them, as &s;uch a view will enable us properly to appreciate the article in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Camillus &s;tates, that a recovery of the&s;e po&s;ts will extin|gui&s;h a &s;ource of controver&s;y between the two countries&mdash;will enable us to controul the ho&s;tilities of certain Indian tribes, which have already co&s;t four millions&mdash;will extend our trade&mdash; will prevent Great Britain from contracting our boundaries&mdash; and will promote an harmonious and permanent connexion between the we&s;tern and Atlantic countries.</P>
<P>That all the&s;e benefits would have accrued to the United States from an unconditional &s;urrender of the&s;e po&s;ts, cannot be doubted. I &s;ay, unconditional, becau&s;e when we come to the third article, we &s;hall find, that as far as an exten&s;ion of trade is concerned, Great Britain has taken care not only to come in for a participation of the fur trade, but that this clau&s;e is &s;o con&s;tructed, as to &s;ecure to her, e&s;pecially when her local &s;ituation is con&s;idered, an almo&s;t exclu&s;ive right to this lucrative branch of it. If the &s;urrender of the&s;e po&s;ts will be of &s;uch immen&s;e moment to the United States, and their detention a proportional detriment, how happens it that the acqui&s;ition is not better &s;ecured than it is? You &s;ay, it is true, that the object is <HI>"accompli&s;hed:"</HI> from which expre&s;&s;ion, tak|en by it&s;elf, it might be inferred, that a re&s;toration had <HI>actu|ally</HI> taken place, that being the natural and obvious meaning of the word which is here made u&s;e of. It is not intended in this place to charge Camillus with an intention to deceive, be|cau&s;e from other parts of this number, the period limited for this purpo&s;e is a&s;certained. But he will allow me to a&s;k, as has often been done already, why the differences between the two countries could not have been adju&s;ted in a &s;eparate in&s;tru|ment?
<PB N="220" REF="028389_0796_0FD8EF3AD38A8C58">and why &s;o remote a period is fixed for an evacua|tion, which might certainly have been made in a much &s;horter time?</P>
<P>Great Britain and the United States mutually complained of infractions of the treaty of peace. The former charged as with impeding the recovery of debts; and we, on the other hand, remon&s;trated, among other things, again&s;t her detenti|on of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. Without reviving here the que&s;tion of, who was fir&s;t in fault? which would only lead to repetiti|on, and does not admit of much new light, it may be demand|ed, as the United States have, by the 6th article, not only admitted the truth of the allegation again&s;t them, but provid|ed for, and actually a&s;&s;umed, and pledged their faith for pay|ment of the principal and intere&s;t of all the Briti&s;h debts of this de&s;cription; why, after &s;o &s;olemn and entire removal of the &s;ole ground of complaint, did not our envoy in&s;i&s;t upon a more prompt execution of tho&s;e parts of the treaty which had been violated by Great Britain? It is evident that actual payment was not made by her a condition precedent; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s than eighteen months are allowed for the exhibition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> claims after the commi&s;&s;ioners meet. She, therefore, con&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed the promi&s;e on the part of our government as equival<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to a complete performance of &s;uch parts of the treaty as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alleged had been infringed by us. It became her duty, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, the moment this ob&s;tacle was removed, to withdraw her g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ri&s;ons, in the words of that treaty, <HI>"with all convenient &s;peed."</HI> The&s;e terms have been called ambiguous, although Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Britain her&s;elf, by her conduct immediately &s;ub&s;equent to the treaty, a&s;&s;igned to them a meaning which they plainly import and which none but a &s;ceptic would ever have called i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> que&s;tion. It we may judge by the time employed in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing from other parts of the United States, and particularly from this city (New York, who&s;e evacuation was comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d in the fall of 1783) we may conclude, that the garri&s;ons from the&s;e po&s;ts might have all been withdrawn in fewer weeks than our envoy has granted months for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Taking together this article, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the contem|plated evacuation, and the &s;ixth article, ab&s;tracted from other parts of the treaty, perhaps no other rea&s;onable objection can be offered again&s;t them, except the unrea&s;onable time allowed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Great Britain to perform her part of the &s;tipulation. But when it is con&s;idered, that this article makes part of a treaty of com|merce, replete with the mo&s;t injurious conce&s;&s;ions from the United States, &s;ome of which have undoubtedly been in&s;i&s;ted upon as con&s;iderations for it; who will be hardy enough to ex|patiate
<PB N="221" REF="028389_0797_0FD8EF3C4F0707D8">upon advantages which bear no compari&s;on with the &s;acrifices which have been incurred to obtain them? It will rea|dily occur, to every reader, that if America refu&s;es to ratify a &s;ingle article, this one which has been excepted as the chef d'oeuvre of our negociator, mu&s;t al&s;o become a dead letter. Every friend to his country mu&s;t fervently wi&s;h either that the pre&s;ident will have virtue and firmne&s;s enough to refu&s;e it his &s;anction, or that the king, in a fit of pride, will not con&s;ent to the modification propo&s;ed by the &s;enate. That honorable body may yet, without intending it, have promoted the &s;alvation of their country.</P>
<P>But admitting a ratification to take place, is not every page a fruitful &s;ource of doubts and altercations? If about &s;o plain and &s;hort an in&s;trument as that which gave us peace, di&s;putes immediately aro&s;e between the two countries, and continued without adju&s;tment for more than ten years&mdash;if the plaine&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, and one of the mo&s;t important articles, were quib|bled into unmeaning and nugatory &s;tipulations&mdash;if the con|&s;tructions of Great Britain, although manife&s;tly repug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant to the &s;en&s;e of the contracting parties&mdash;to the &s;ubject matter of the compact, and to the plain import of the terms, has been warmly &s;upported by men of talents and character among our|&s;elves, who can &s;ay that &s;imilar di&s;cu&s;&s;ions and difficulties will not very &s;oon take place re&s;pecting an agreement, containing as many pages as the other does &s;entences, and embracing a much greater variety of matter? In &s;uch an event, the charge that we have <HI>fir&s;t</HI> broken the treaty will be renewed; we may retort it if we plea&s;e; but the po&s;ts will be detained until the differences are &s;ettled, for which purpo&s;e another emba&s;&s;y extraordinary mu&s;t be recurred to; and who can in&s;ure that we &s;hall then be able to command the diplomatic &s;kill and talents of Governor Jay? Notwith&s;tanding, therefore, Camillus con&s;iders this object as accompli&s;hed, it may fairly be regarded as di&s;tant as ever, or at lea&s;t depending on &s;uch a variety of intervening incidents, as may probably defeat it altogether. It has frequently been urged, that nothing but a de&s;ire to procra&s;tinate, and finally to break her engagements, if circum&s;tances render it prudent, could have induced Great Britain to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;o unrea&s;onable a time to perform what good faith demanded of her, the moment we &s;atisfied the breach, alleged to have been made by us, and which &s;he could have no intere&s;t in deferring to a remote day, if &s;he ultimately intended to comply with her promi&s;e. To garri&s;on &s;o many forts mu&s;t be a great expen&s;e, to &s;ay nothing of the troops who might be much more profita|bly employed el&s;ewhere. The views, therefore of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="222" REF="028389_0798_0FD8EF3DCB7C8958">cabinet in retaining them &s;o long, can neither be honorable, nor of the mo&s;t pacific nature. They fore&s;ee, that if any con|trover&s;y ari&s;es between the two governments, which is almo&s;t unavoidable, Great Britain will have a pretext for not carrying into effect this &s;tipulation. They al&s;o fore&s;ee, or hope, that peace will, in the mean time, be re&s;tored to Europe, and that the king will have it in his power to make &s;uch u&s;e of interven|ing occurrences as circum&s;tances may render prudent. On the part of America, no propitious event can rea&s;onably be ex|pected. Determined as &s;he is to abide by all her engagements, which &s;he has evinced in every trying &s;ituation, hers was the pre&s;ent moment! It is almo&s;t pa&s;t; if &s;he neglects, as an in|con&s;iderate individual, to improve it, which has too long been the ca&s;e, years of remor&s;e and regret mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P>If America could have commanded events, a more fortunate coincidence could not have occurred than tho&s;e which &s;ucceeded each other, in rapid and a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s, during the whole of her negociation; a more brilliant campaign, than the one on the part of our ally, is not furni&s;hed in the annals of hi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. Succe&s;s every where crowned her arms&mdash;although &s;ingly op|po&s;ed to the coale&s;ced powers of Europe, &s;he not only expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d which &s;urpa&s;s belief. Great Britain, with an ob&s;tinacy bordering on de&s;pair, expected her fate, which all Europe con&s;idered inevitable. Could a more au&s;picious &s;ea&s;on for negociation have been de&s;ired? Our information from Great Britain corre&s;ponded with the &s;anguine expectations which the reiterated defeats of the combined armies, compo&s;ed in part of Briti&s;h regiments, could not fail to excite. Every letter from London was repla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e with the &s;ucce&s;sful career of our envoy.

Nothing was talked of on either &s;ide of the Atlantic, but the gracious reception of the American mini&s;ter, and the di&s;tingui&s;hed at|tentions which he received. Even the royal family vied with the mini&s;ters in their efforts to render his vi&s;it as plea&s;ing as po&s;&s;i|ble; and when intelligence arrived, that a treaty was &s;igned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a man doubted but the terms of it corre&s;ponded with this for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|nate concurrence of circum&s;tances.

<PB N="223" REF="028389_0799_0FD8EF42069DE8A0">after all this, can believe that this golden opportunity has been permitted to e&s;cape, and that the fears of Great Britain have been allowed to &s;ub&s;ide without our compelling her to do us ju&s;tice? Who can believe that &s;he has had addre&s;s enough to &s;end our envoy home with a treaty which has kindled through|out the continent a flame greater than any excited by her former indignities or vexations? Camillus will &s;mile, as he always does, at the idea of addre&s;&s;ing the apprehen&s;ions of Great Britain, or laying hold of her fears to extort from her that redre&s;s which a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;hould long &s;ince have induced her to grant. Philo-Camillus has re&s;ented, in very intemperate language, my calling Camillus an apologi&s;t of Great Britain. I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed for not retracting an appellation, which is not le&s;s courted by Camillus, than deprecated by his friend.</P>
<P>Does not the 7th number of the Defence furni&s;h new proofs of the epithet which has been applied to Camillus? Every picture which repre&s;ents the &s;ituation of Great Britain as criti|cal, is termed by him "exaggerated or fal&s;e." If her armies and tho&s;e of her allies have been defeated by land, &s;he is, not|with&s;tanding, <HI>"triumphant on the ocean."</HI> If &s;he owes an im|men&s;e debt, <HI>"her credit is unimpaired"</HI> and <HI>"her re&s;ources are prodigious."</HI> If &s;ome di&s;contents prevail, <HI>"her government is vigorous, and was never better &s;upported."</HI> If her manufactures are injured, <HI>"they are &s;till in a flouri&s;hing &s;ituation."</HI> If her commerce is annoyed, <HI>"it is, notwith&s;tanding, exten&s;ive, and pro&s;perous."</HI> If &s;he is in difficulties or di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>"&s;he is &s;till haughty and overbearing."</HI> Truly, &s;ir! while you thus ring changes on the &s;trength and re&s;ources of Great Britain, who can be blamed for &s;u&s;pecting your motives? Injured as we are, would it not have been a better proof of your amor patriae, if you now and then brought into view, and no one can do it better, &s;ome of the re&s;ources of your own country? Your lan|guage con&s;tantly reminds us of the conduct of the royali&s;ts at the commencement of the late war. They expatiated, in very &s;imilar terms, on the folly, and even madne&s;s, of oppo&s;ing by force, acts of the Briti&s;h parliament. They a&s;&s;erted, and with too much truth, that we were without men, without arms, without military knowledge, without money, without &s;hips, without forts, without credit, and without any of the common means of defence; that our commerce would be ru|ined, our towns reduced to a&s;hes; and our country laid wa&s;te. America, although the evils which &s;he then complained of were incon&s;iderable, when compared with the aggravated in|&s;ults and wrongs &s;he is now &s;ubmitting to, &s;purned at the thou|&s;and dangers which awaited her. Di&s;daining to &s;ubmit, &s;he
<PB N="224" REF="028389_0800_0FD8EF431C9B9FA8">ri&s;ked all to obtain redre&s;s. Heaven &s;miled on her god-like efforts, and the bloody and unequal conte&s;t terminated in free|dom and independence.</P>
<P>It will not be without u&s;e to take a cur&s;ory view, in this place, of &s;ome, of our re&s;ources, in ca&s;e we are forced into war with a nation who&s;e vexations, want of faith and ju&s;tice, will &s;carcely leave us any other alternative. War, at any time, and under any circum&s;tances, is an evil to be &s;eriou&s;ly depre|cated; but it is a calamity, again&s;t which no human prudence or fore&s;ight, can, at all times, guard us. It is profitable, there|fore, to know our own &s;trength and importance, not that we may become in&s;olent, and provoke aggre&s;&s;ions, but that we may re&s;ent, in a dignified manner, tho&s;e to which we may be expo&s;ed from the inju&s;tice or pride of other nations. It is not by tamely crouching to in&s;ults and indignities that we can long hope for the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of peace; it is by being ju&s;t to others, and compelling others to be ju&s;t to us. We may &s;uffer in the conflict; but while our conduct is remembered, our public cha|racter will command re&s;pect, and no nation will gladly &s;eek occa&s;ions to quarrel with us. The conce&s;&s;ions we have been in a habit of making to Great Britain, and the returns we have received, have not only deba&s;ed us abroad, but have damped the ardour of our youth, who cannot too early be taught to re&s;pect their country, and to re&s;ent the injuries &s;he may receive. The pu&s;illanimous language with which our public prints abound, would better &s;uit the minions of an arbitrary de&s;pot, than the citizens of a free and enlightened nation. Patrioti&s;m and the love of liberty are almo&s;t extinct, and we mu&s;t not be &s;urprized, if the virtuous and heroic deeds of our countrymen who conducted us to the temple of freedom, and gave us a &s;eat among the nations of the earth, are &s;oon &s;tigmatized as the Jacobinical efforts of di&s;contented Democrats and Anarchi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. The&s;e are the mild epithets which are con&s;tantly applied by a certain party, to the be&s;t patriots among us, for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e, feeling for the pro&s;trated honor and violated rights of their country, they urge the government to a more manly expre&s;&s;ion of their &s;entiments, and a more &s;pirited vindication of their wrongs.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of war with Great Britain (which is by no means probable, if we act with becoming &s;pirit) what are the evils to be apprehended?&mdash;Her mo&s;t zealous partizans ridicule the idea of her ever obtaining a footing in this country. At the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and leagues, reduced as her army already is, and at war with a great maritime power, it cannot be dreaded that &s;he will be able to tran&s;port to this country, troops adequate to &s;uch
<PB N="225" REF="028389_0801_0FD8EF44D5CBDD50">an attempt. If &s;he had the means, her experience in the la&s;t war mu&s;t &s;atisfy her, that no conque&s;t &s;he can attempt will be an equivalent for the enormous expen&s;e of making and holding it. During the la&s;t war, although &s;he recruited her armies in this country, although &s;he &s;ub&s;idized &s;everal German princes, yet, with all this &s;trength, added to her own, the only perma|nent acqui&s;itions &s;he made were a few acres on our &s;ea coa&s;ts. Many of the di&s;advantages with which America then had to contend exi&s;t no longer. Among the&s;e may be reckoned, a cruel internal foe, whom, for a long time, we did not dare to puni&s;h as traitors.

Great Britain, it will al&s;o be remembered, was then in the zenith of her power, and at peace with all the world, which &s;he had enjoyed without interruption &s;ince the treaty of Paris, in 1763, a period of more than twelve years. Under all the&s;e di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, America un&s;heath|ed the &s;word.

<P>P. S. I am abu&s;ed for my intemperate expre&s;&s;ions with re|&s;pect to Camillus. I neither know him, nor does he know me. My conclu&s;ions are drawn from his writings. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be a patriot, he takes uncommon pains to make the world think otherwi&s;e. He calls me a Jacobin for defending my country; and he and his friends are angry with me when I &s;u&s;pect his patrioti&s;m for making &s;uch defence nece&s;&s;ary. No good will re&s;ult from being per&s;onal. Let principles, and not men, be our objects. Again&s;t arguments, and not motives (except when they may be fairly inferred from our public conduct or writings) be our attack. By his defence (for I know nothing more of him) &s;hall my judgment be formed of Camillus. By my reply (which is all he will probably ever know of me) he is at liberty to make up his opinion of me. Ridicule and abu&s;e are no more te&s;ts of truth, than flowing numbers or fine-turned periods. A que&s;tion more momentous, than the one in which we are engaged, has not been agitated &s;ince our exi&s;tence as a nation! Let us be warm, but not rude. With the talents of Camillus, the ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> would be ea&s;y to convince any unprejudiced per&s;on, that our very independence hangs on a rejection of the treaty. But na|ture is &s;eldom as lavi&s;h of her gifts as &s;he has been to Camillus; I mu&s;t be content, therefore, to pur&s;ue, in plain and unadorned language, a duty which birth and citizen&s;hip impo&s;e upon me, and in which I have no object unconnected with the welfare and happine&s;s of my country.</P>

<P>IT is objected by &s;ome, who are for enduring every extre|mity, rather than incur the hazards of war, that our trade will be ruined by Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, and that the revenue ari&s;ing from it will fail. That our intercour&s;e with foreign nations will undergo &s;ome interruption, and our commerce be expo&s;ed to con&s;iderable ri&s;k and injury, cannot be denied; but let us not look only at the dark &s;ide of the picture; if our trade to other nations is impeded, their &s;hips will find no difficulty in obtaining acce&s;s to us; they will a&s;&s;ert their neutral rights; and, being no longer colonies, Great Britain will have no preten|tions
<PB N="227" REF="028389_0803_0FD8EF4C132C7668">to interdict this communication, unle&s;s, indeed, &s;he &s;hould attempt to &s;tarve the United States, and by proclamation blockade every port in the union. Such of the&s;e nations, as have not had the weakne&s;s or complai&s;ance of America, to &s;acrifice to Great Britain, the protection which neutral bottoms &s;hould over afford, even to enemies' goods, may tran&s;port our property in &s;afety to any part of the globe. It may well be doubted, then, whether our imports will be much le&s;s in times of war than at pre&s;ent, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ven our exports in neutral ve&s;&s;els, and our own, will be con&s;iderable. Our merchants often mention, with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, the number of ve&s;&s;els, which arrived &s;afe during our revolutionary conte&s;t; when even neutral bottoms could not reach us without the &s;ame hazard of being captured and con|demned as our own. But the commerce we &s;hould carry on, and that of neutral countries, would not be the only &s;ources of revenue; our privateers would cover the ocean. Does not the commerce of Britain hold out allurements, and afford an exten|&s;ive &s;ource of wealth to our enterprizing merchants and mari|ners? The duty on prize goods, added to that on the impor|tation of goods in the ordinary way, would not only prevent a diminution of the revenue, but carry it beyond its pre&s;ent point. Who would believe, that in the maritime courts of only three of the counties of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, namely, of Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex, and Middle&s;ex, there were libelled, during the la&s;t war, no le&s;s than one thou&s;and and ninety-five ve&s;&s;els, with their car|goes, and thirteen cargoes which had been taken from ve&s;&s;els abandoned after their capture, making in the whole eleven hun|dred and eight! Mr. Coxe, in his View of the United States, a&s;&s;ures us, that the records of tho&s;e counties authenticate the fact. He al&s;o adds, that the number of ve&s;&s;els belonging to Great Britain, in 1774, as &s;tated by a Briti&s;h premier, in his place in parliament, was, 6219, whereof 3908 were Briti&s;h built, and 2311 were American built. "What havoc then," exclaims Mr. Coxe, "did the&s;e fi&s;hermen make among the Bri|ti&s;h merchantmen? above a &s;ixth of all their ve&s;&s;els, were brought by the&s;e people as prizes into the markets of the United States, with cargoes to an immen&s;e amount, compo&s;ed of every &s;pecies of military and dome&s;tic &s;upply, in a &s;ea&s;on of the utmo&s;t emergency: it appears too, that the&s;e prizes were no le&s;s than a fourth part of all the Briti&s;h built &s;hips of that nation. The opinion of the mo&s;t candid and be&s;t-informed e&s;timaters, founded on careful enquiry, countenance the pre&s;umption, that fifty-five per cent. of all the ve&s;&s;els, captured by the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts during the war, were taken before their arrival; &s;o that there is the utmo&s;t probability, that the whole number
<PB N="228" REF="028389_0804_0FD8EF4D9F17A010">of ve&s;&s;els, which were captured by the &s;hipping of the&s;e three counties, was 2450 &s;ail. How great a derangement was this to the Briti&s;h commerce; and how heavy mu&s;t have been the ex|pen&s;e of &s;alvage paid to the re-captors; how great the number of marine pri&s;oners; how &s;erious the interruption to the man|ning of the navy? "It would appear," &s;ays Mr. Coxe, "that the armed ve&s;&s;els of our principal fi&s;hing &s;tate, captured, in the cour&s;e of the late war, near one half of the merchant &s;hips, ordinarily belonging to Great Britain, and abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> three-fourths of the number of her nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> built &s;hips."</P>
<P>A &s;triking proof is exhibited, in what precedes, of the &s;eri|ous impre&s;&s;ion made by <HI>our</HI> ve&s;&s;els on the navigation of Great Britain, at a time too, when it might rea&s;onably be thought &s;he had nothing to fear from us. The &s;ource from which this information is drawn, precludes the po&s;&s;ibility of error. It may be added, that &s;uch were the apprehen&s;ions then enter|tained of American privateers, that in&s;urance of Briti&s;h mer|chantmen was more exorbitant than in any war, in which that kingdom had been engaged for fifty years pa&s;t, although no ma|ritime nation, with whom &s;he had contended during that period, had been &s;o deficient in &s;hips of war, as the United States. If America, then, in her very infancy, when &s;he had to contend with a thou&s;and difficulties, which are now &s;urmounted, and can never occur again, was able thus to annoy the greate&s;t na|val power in Europe&mdash;who can e&s;timate the wounds which &s;he may now inflict on her commerce, in the pre&s;ent advanced &s;tate of her population and &s;hipping? She would indeed find us an unprofitable and trouble&s;ome enemy; without the means of retaliation, &s;he would have every thing to apprehend from America. Her trade, as well as that of Spain, Holland, and Portugal, pa&s;&s;es by our coa&s;ts; and the injury and lo&s;&s;es to which it would be expo&s;ed, are incalculable.</P>
<P>But not in her trade alone, would Great Britain be vulnera|ble; her colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent, mu&s;t fall into our hands. If the gallant Montgomery, at the head of a few hundred men, rai&s;ed in ha&s;te, badly armed, and although brave, mere novices in di&s;cipline, reduced, in an inclement &s;ea&s;on, the whole province of Canada, except its capital, which, but for his unfortunate and much-lamented death, would al&s;o have opened its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tes to the American arms; what may we not ex|pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he formidable force we &s;hould now be able to &s;end again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">? The inhabitants of Vermont alone, which was then but beginning its &s;ettlement, would more than &s;uffice for its conque&s;t. I make no account of the di&s;po&s;ition of the inha|bitants, who are repre&s;ented as highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Bri|ti&s;h,
<PB N="229" REF="028389_0805_0FD8EF515FB7B488">and anxiou&s;ly waiting a favorable occa&s;ion to &s;hake off their yoke, and become part of the United States. Nova Scotia too, and the adjoining &s;ettlements, would be an ea&s;y prey to the militia of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and the Province of Maine. The&s;e important acqui&s;itions to the United States would more than countervail any lo&s;s they could po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;tain. Nor would any part of the We&s;t Indies, in ca&s;e of an American war, long continue colonies of Great Britain. France, with the aid &s;he might derive from this country, could not &s;ail to reduce them. Her fleets and armies, de&s;tined for &s;uch an expedition, after re|cruiting in the United States, might proceed, full of health and well-provi&s;ioned for the i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The evils to Great Britain would not &s;top here. Her &s;ubjects hold great part of the public debt of the United States, and our citizens are indebted to them, to the amount of many millions &s;terling. Britain being the aggre&s;&s;ing nation, and the war not only of her &s;eeking, but manife&s;tly unju&s;t on her part, the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation would dictate, and her own conduct, and the laws of war ju&s;tify, the &s;eque&s;tration of this property. Mr. Jay, it is true, with more complai&s;ance to Lord Grenville, than delicacy to his own government, has declared &s;uch conduct impolitic and unju&s;t. Congre&s;s, and in particular Mr. Dayton, who moved the mea&s;ure, will not &s;oon forget &s;o hand&s;ome a compliment from a mini&s;ter, who&s;e re&s;pect for the legi&s;lature of his own country, whatever his private &s;entiments might be, ought to have checked this intemperate effu&s;ion. Mr. Jay appears to have thought an excu&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for an article, by which we yield much, without gaining any thing; and was, therefore, determined to in&s;ert one even at the expen&s;e of con|gre&s;s and the honour of his own country.</P>
<P>The tenth article will probably undergo an inve&s;tigation here|after; we proceed, therefore, to enumerate &s;ome other di&s;|tre&s;&s;es to which an American war might expo&s;e Great Britain. The injury to her trade, from our privateers, has already been &s;tated; but if not a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el of this de&s;cription was fitted out, &s;till her commerce would &s;uffer beyond e&s;timation. The interruption of her trade to this country, would be an evil which admits of no alleviation. In the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety one, we took from Great Britain, exclud|ing Ireland and the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, in Briti&s;h manufactures, to the immen&s;e value of very near four millions of pounds &s;ter|ling. It al&s;o appears, from authentic public documents, that the ve&s;&s;els of Great Britain, loaded in the United States, in 1791 and 92, were about equal in tonnage to all the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, cleared out of that kingdom for Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, Nor|way,
<PB N="230" REF="028389_0806_0FD8EF5481827980">Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Hamburgh, Bremen, and Germany in general. Will a nation, not infatuated, readily plunge into war with America, and encounter &s;o great a lo&s;s as mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue from a &s;tagnation of trade; for the uncertain and precarious advantages to be reaped from &s;uch a &s;tate of things? If we have no &s;ecurity in her wi&s;dom or ju&s;|tice, may we not place &s;ome reliance on her intere&s;t, which will be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly and directly affected by a ce&s;&s;ation of all in|tercour&s;e between her and the United States? what will be the clamours of her manufacturers, many of whom are already idle and &s;tarving, when &s;uch valuable con&s;umers, as the Ame|ricans, are compelled, by the inju&s;tice of their own govern|ment, to withdraw their cu&s;tom? What mu&s;t be the difficulties and di&s;contents of the merchants, when all remittances from this country not only cea&s;e, but when their debtors here may be rendered unable, in the cour&s;e of the war, to pay any part of their dues, even on the return of peace? What, but an univer&s;al &s;pirit of di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;&s;atisfaction mu&s;t pervade the whole kingdom, which is now panting for peace, when it is di&s;covered, that the mini&s;ter, by his violence and ra&s;hne&s;s, in&s;tead of re&s;toring to it &s;o great a boon, has precipitated it into a new war, which cannot fail to be unpopular, and as long as &s;uch exten&s;ive commercial connexions &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two countries, mu&s;t be execrated in proportion to the ruin and di&s;tre&s;s which will ever accompany it? Tho&s;e who affect to de&s;pi&s;e the public opinion of Great Britain, betray an ignorance of the hi&s;tory of that kingdom. However &s;trong the pre&s;ent attachment to their con&s;titution&mdash;however well &s;upported the crown may be&mdash;whatever backwardne&s;s or apprehen&s;ion may be di&s;covered at the mention of a revolution, after &s;ome of the unfortunate exce&s;&s;es which have been perpetrated in France, the voice of the people, in much more arbitrary reigns, has made it&s;elf heard, and mini&s;ters, who have been favorites of the crown, and &s;upported with all the patronage and weight of royalty, have been compelled to yield to the imperious, torrent, or have been brought to the block in their attempt to with&s;tand it.</P>
<P>To conclude, from what happened in England in the la&s;t war, that one with America at pre&s;ent will be popular, would be to rea&s;on from mi&s;taken premi&s;es. At that time an act of parliament had declared us in rebellion, and the general accep|tation and belief corre&s;ponded with the declaration. The very term carried with it &s;omething that enli&s;ts the feelings of man|kind again&s;t tho&s;e, who are branded with the odious epithet. Many wi&s;e men in England, were in &s;entiment with this coun|try, while &s;he confined her object to redre&s;s of grievance, and
<PB N="231" REF="028389_0807_0FD8EF55CF9B4510">&s;ought it by petitions and addre&s;&s;es; but when &s;he took up arms, and more e&s;pecially when &s;he declared her&s;elf independ|ent, views, ho&s;tile to the mother country, were imputed to her from the beginning, and a mea&s;ure, extorted by dire ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, was con&s;idered, as full evidence of an original and early de&s;ign to &s;eparate the colonies from the mother country. Although nothing could be more fallacious, and, in point of fact, more erroneous than &s;uch an inference, it had its effect; and either from real abhor|rence of its attempt, or from a fear to avow their real &s;entiments, the American cau&s;e, for &s;ome time, lo&s;t ground in England.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, we are not only an independent people, but have been formally recognized in that character by the king and parliament of Great Britain. The ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, as well as the advantages and injuries of the war, would, therefore, become objects of enquiry in England, the re&s;ult of which could not fail to be favorable to the American government and character. It could not e&s;cape the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, that with a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to cultivate peace, ju&s;tice, and good under&s;tanding with all mankind, we had been mo&s;t cruelly in|&s;ulted and outraged by the Briti&s;h cabinet. Corre&s;ponding &s;en|timents would take place, and the throne and parliament would be environed with petitions for peace; for, even in that coun|try, it is yet lawful for the &s;ubject to convey, in re&s;pectful language, his complaints to the &s;upreme authority of the na|tion, without incurring the appellation of Jacobin or Anar|chi&s;t. What would be the effect of a war on the public debt of Great Britain, be&s;ides a prodigious accumulation, cannot be a&s;certained. Its pre&s;ent enormous bulk mu&s;t fill thinking men with &s;erious apprehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences of a fur|ther increa&s;e. It already exceeds what the mo&s;t intrepid financier would dare to call a public ble&s;&s;ing. When we con&s;i|der what an enormous &s;um was added to it by her attempt to reduce this country to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the im|men&s;e expen&s;e attending the operations of war, who&s;e &s;cene is &s;o di&s;tant as America, it would excite no &s;urprize, &s;hould a national bankruptcy be the con&s;equence of another &s;imilar ex|ertion. Private bankruptcy mu&s;t follow, and public, as well as individual ruin mu&s;t en&s;ue. No man yet has forgotten the numerous failures and private di&s;tre&s;s which immediately &s;uc|ceeded the late rupture with France, the &s;hock of which mu&s;t have been incon&s;iderable, compared with what would happen on a breach with this country.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay tho&s;e, who are, at all events, for peaceful mea&s;ures, your &s;ea ports are defencele&s;s, and will be laid in a&s;hes. De|grading
<PB N="232" REF="028389_0808_0FD8EF5A82DB4320">as my opinion is of the public conduct of Great Britain, I cannot bring my&s;elf to believe, that &s;he will pay &s;o little regard to the laws of war and humanity, as to conduct it in a way &s;o totally repugnant to both. The burning of defencele&s;s towns, or even tho&s;e which are fortified, unle&s;s in attempts to reduce them, is an imputation &s;o horrid, that it can only be made to excite our alarms. It is an evil not to be &s;eriou&s;ly appre|hended. It is a po&s;&s;ible, but not a probable danger. De&s;olating as the la&s;t war was, which raged with all the bitterne&s;s of civil fury, when neither principles, character, nor humanity were re&s;pected, how few of our towns were con&s;umed: If then this calamity was but partially experienced during a controver&s;y, in which a breach of faith and humanity towards rebels, was deemed no &s;tain on the national character of Great Britain, why are we to apprehend this mercile&s;s warfare at pre&s;ent? It will neither be the policy nor intere&s;t of our enemy to conduct it in this way. The &s;ea ports are emphatically the re&s;idence of their be&s;t friends. De&s;troy them, and by whom will the injury be felt? Principally by the advocates, not the enemies of Great Britain; by her apologi&s;ts, not by our friends. Burn the &s;ea ports, and what becomes of the Briti&s;h debtors? Set fire to our cities, and America, having lo&s;t all, &s;he will become a de&s;|perate and implacable foe. But has Great Britain no defence|le&s;s towns? If ju&s;tice and humanity have lo&s;t their influence on her councils, &s;till motives of intere&s;t will not be wanting to re|&s;train her from &s;uch barbarous di&s;plays of her &s;uperiority. Will &s;he not dread retaliation? If America cannot, will not France be able to return the infamous warfare in kind? Will not all Europe applaud a deed provoked by her own cruelties and wan|tonne&s;s? Let us turn then from the di&s;gu&s;ting apprehen&s;ion, chimerical in the extreme. While France is at war, &s;he can always, and it will be her intere&s;t to, furni&s;h a fleet &s;uffici|ent for the protection of tho&s;e of our towns which are mo&s;t expo&s;ed. Twelve &s;hips of the line and as many frigates, which we ought to have of our own, will more than &s;uffice for the purpo&s;e. Many of them are capable of fortification, and it would be no di&s;credit to the government to employ more activity in putting them in a better &s;tate of defence. It is become &s;o com|mon, to attribute every effu&s;ion of patrioti&s;m to the wor&s;t of motives; that it is with &s;ome reluctance I dare to remind my fellow citizens, of the united voice of America, when &s;imilar apprehen&s;ions were excited to deter her from any oppo&s;ition to the claims of the Briti&s;h parliament. I mu&s;t, however, be &s;o con&s;onant to the feelings of many of the patriots of that day who yet &s;urvive, and who&s;e principles are not adulterated by
<PB N="233" REF="028389_0809_0FD8EF5BCF076D68">pen&s;ions and offices, that I cannot withhold the plea&s;ure it mu&s;t afford them. "No, &s;irs," &s;ays congre&s;s, with one voice, ad|dre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to the people of Great Britain, "we never will, while we revere the memory of our gallant and virtuous ance&s;tors, we never can &s;urrender the&s;e glorious privileges for which they fought, bled, and conquered; admit, that your fleets could de&s;troy our towns, and ravage our &s;ea coa&s;ts; the&s;e are incon&s;iderable objects; things of no moment to men, who&s;e bo&s;oms glow with the ardour of liberty. We can retire beyond the reach of your navy, and, without any &s;en&s;ible diminution of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, enjoy a luxury, which, from that period, you will want; <HI>the luxury of being free!</HI>" This was the language of America, when &s;he had infinitely more to appre|hend than at pre&s;ent. Whither has the &s;pirit, that dictated it, taken its flight? Where is now that public virtue, which not only manife&s;ted it&s;elf by tho&s;e &s;olemn expre&s;&s;ions, which are now ridiculed as the frantic ravings of a di&s;tempered imagina|tion, but carried into exerci&s;e, re&s;olutions which a&s;toni&s;hed tho&s;e to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, and which, any but men &s;truggling to be free, would have &s;huddered to adopt? What, I repeat, is become of this &s;pirit and patrioti&s;m? Are they laughed to &s;corn? Or do they cea&s;e to warm and animate the &s;ons of Columbia? Heaven forbid! A few years of peace and luxury cannot have enervated their limbs, extingui&s;hed their martial fire, or &s;tifled, in their generous brea&s;ts, &s;entiments which were once e&s;teemed their ornament and pride. They want but to be rouzed into action. Should a nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;t, and the gallant youth of America be &s;ummoned to their coun|try's &s;tandard, may we not indulge the fond hope, that they will pant to entwine their brows with laurels, gathered in the walks of glory and honor, and burn to emulate, if not &s;ur|pa&s;s, their illu&s;trious fathers in heroic efforts, to avenge the public cau&s;e?</P>

To pre&s;erve our con&s;titution of government in its pre&s;ent limited, and happy form; to guard again&s;t the encroachments, and the ambitious views of men, with whom the arm of power is entru&s;ted; to prevent the executive magi&s;trate from interfering with and exerci&s;ing legi&s;lative authorities; to maintain inviolate our na|tional independence, and to give &s;tability and energy to tho&s;e political rights and liberties which are guaranteed by the fir&s;t terms of the &s;ocial compact; is indeed an arduous, but it is a nece&s;&s;ary duty; a ta&s;k which requires the mo&s;t intimate union of patrioti&s;m and talents, of deliberation and caution, with fortitude and firmne&s;s.</P>

Shall re&s;entment and pa&s;&s;ion be always &s;ub&s;tituted for &s;olid argument, and the invidious tongue of calumny be permitted to &s;tifle enquiry?

<HEAD>No. XXXIII.&mdash;Concluded.</HEAD>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, from the number of modern treaties, which exclude from that li&s;t naval &s;tores, and moreover from the manife&s;t intere&s;t of nations, truly con&s;idered, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|row the rights of war in favor of tho&s;e of peace; this clau&s;e of the treaty, which takes a different route, is to be regretted as pur&s;uing the rigour of the law of nations&mdash;Still, however, it cannot be objected to, as a departure from the law; and agreeing with the cour&s;e ob&s;erved by Great Britain antecedent to the treaty, it does not place our trade in the&s;e articles upon a wor&s;e footing than it was, independent of the treaty.</P>
<P>The period of the negociation was mo&s;t unpropitious to a change for the better&mdash;in the mid&s;t of any maritime war, a belligerent nation, enjoying a naval &s;uperiority, was like to have been tenacious of a right which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intercept naval &s;upplies to her enemy&mdash;But in a war, in which it was more than ordinarily po&s;&s;ible that the independent exi&s;t|ence of a nation might depend on the retaining a naval &s;uperi|ority, it was to have been fore&s;een that &s;he would not con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to relinqui&s;h &s;uch a right. The alternative was, to in&s;ert the ar|ticle as it &s;tands, or to omit it wholly.</P>
<P>Had it been omitted, the condition of naval &s;tores would have been the &s;ame as with it. But our merchants would th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> have continued to be expo&s;ed to uncertain ri&s;ks, which is alway a great inconvenience. It is de&s;irable, in &s;imilar ca&s;es, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a fixed rule. Merchants can then accommodate their &s;peculation to the rule; and cau&s;es of national contention are avoided.</P>
<P>It is in this view to be regretted, that the ca&s;es when provi|&s;ions may be treated as contraband, could not have been agreed upon; but as this was impracticable, the next be&s;t thing has been done, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the certainty of compen&s;ation in all &s;uch ca&s;es. This gives one important &s;pecies of &s;ecurity, obviates one &s;ource of contention. And if really there may be other ca&s;es than the univer&s;ally admitted ones, in which provi&s;ions can fairly be deemed contraband (as that de&s;ignated by the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of congre&s;s of May 1777) the &s;ecuring of compen&s;ation wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> truly a point gained by the article.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="028389_0815_0FD8EF6B440B85C0">
But while I confe&s;s, that the including of naval &s;tores, among contraband articles, is an incligible feature of the treaty, I ought to declare, that its con&s;equences to the intere&s;ts of the United States, as it regards the trade in tho&s;e articles in time of war, do not appear to me important&mdash;War between other nations, when we are at peace, will always increa&s;e the demand for our bottoms, &s;o as to require much additional building of ve&s;&s;els, and probably in that way to produce a more beneficial &s;pecies of employment of the naval &s;tores our country affords, than that of their exportation for &s;ale.</P>
<P>The adver&s;aries of the treaty are eagle-eyed to &s;py out in|&s;tances in which it omits any favourable minutes which are found in our other treaties; but they forget to balance the ac|count by particulars which di&s;tingui&s;h it favorably from tho&s;e treaties. Of this nature is the omi&s;&s;ion of hor&s;es from the li&s;t of contraband, and &s;till more the &s;alutary regulations with re|gard to ve&s;&s;els and their cargoes going to places be&s;ieged, block|aded, or inve&s;ted. I do not di&s;cover that the&s;e u&s;eful provi&s;ions or their equivalents, are in either of our treaties with France, Holland, or Sweden.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, in reference to this article, "whenever the law of nations has been a topic for con&s;ideration, the re&s;ult of the treaty accommodates Great Britain, in relation to one or both of the republics at war with her, as well as in the abandon|ment of the rights and intere&s;ts of the United States,"&mdash;And the following examples are given, to each of which will be an|nexed a reply.</P>
<P N="1">I. "American ve&s;&s;els, bound to Great Britain, are protect|ed, by &s;ea-papers, again&s;t French and Dutch &s;earches; but when bound to France or Holland, are left expo&s;ed to Briti&s;h &s;earches, without regard to &s;hips' papers." The truth of this propo&s;ition depends on another, which is, that the &s;ea-papers are to be ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive; but rea&s;ons have been given for doubting this con&s;truction, which, it has been remarked, does not obtain in practice. And it is certainly a violent one, ina&s;|much as it puts it in the power of the neutral, to defeat the rights of the belligerent party, in points of great con&s;equence to its &s;afety.</P>
<P N="2">II. "American provi&s;ions, in American ve&s;&s;els, bound to the enemies of Great Britain, are left by the treaty to the &s;eiz|ure and u&s;e of Great Britain; but provi&s;ions, whether Ameri|can or not, in American ve&s;&s;els, cannot be touched by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nemies of Great Britain." The con&s;truction of the treaty, up|on which this difference is &s;uppo&s;ed, has been demon&s;trated to be erroneous.&mdash;The difference, therefore, does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="240" REF="028389_0816_0FD8EF6DD57C6978">
III. "Briti&s;h property, in American ve&s;&s;els, is not &s;ubject to French or Dutch confi&s;cation.&mdash;French or Dutch property in American ve&s;&s;els, is &s;ubject to Briti&s;h confi&s;cation." This was the ca&s;e before the treaty, which makes no alteration in the matter.&mdash;Moreover, it is counterbalanced by this circum|&s;tance;&mdash; That American property, in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, is &s;ubject to confi&s;cation by France or Holland; but American property, in French or Dutch ve&s;&s;els, is not &s;ubject to confi&s;cation by Great Britain.</P>
<P N="4">IV. "Articles of &s;hip-building, bound to the enemies of Great Britain for the equipment of ve&s;&s;els of trade only, are contraband.&mdash;Bound to Great Britain, for the equipment of ve&s;|&s;els of war, are not contraband." This, al&s;o, was the ca&s;e before the treaty, which, con&s;equently, has not in this particular more than the former, produced any benefit to one party, to the pre|judice of the other. I forbear to dwell upon the article of hor&s;es, as falling under a contrary di&s;crimination;&mdash;nor &s;hall I in&s;i&s;t on the additional circum&s;tance, that all American goods not generally contraband, if going to a place be&s;ieged, blocka|ded, or inve&s;ted by French or Dutch forces, are liable to confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cation by France or Holland; if going to a place be&s;ieged, blockaded, or inve&s;ted by Briti&s;h forces, are not liable to con|fi&s;cation by Great Britain.</P>
<P>Differences of the&s;e &s;everal kinds are the accidental <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the varying views of different contracting powers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;lender grounds of blame or prai&s;e of the re&s;pective contracts made with them.</P>
<P>The form of the critici&s;ms la&s;t &s;tated, leaves little doubt that it was de&s;igned to in&s;inuate an intention in this article to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Monarchs of Great Britain, at the expen&s;e of the Re|publics of France and Holland.

<P>THE remaining articles of the treaty principally relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e maritime regulations, that are u&s;ually in&s;erted in modern treaties between commercial nations&mdash;and on that con|&s;ideration, as well as from their evident utility in enabling us to
<PB N="241" REF="028389_0817_0FD8EF6FB5D0BBC0">di&s;tingui&s;h with preci&s;ion between what is, and what is not lawful, in relation to tho&s;e points&mdash;they are entitled to our ap|probation; &s;till however even &s;ome of the&s;e cu&s;tomary articles, who&s;e object and meaning are &s;o well under&s;tood, have been deemed exceptionable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t paragraph of the nineteenth article, in order to prevent injuries by men of war, or privateers, enjoins (as be|fore noticed) all commanders of &s;hips of war and privateers, and all other citizens or &s;ubjects, of either party, to forbear doing any damage to tho&s;e of the other, or from committing any outrage again&s;t them: and decleres, that if they act to the contrary, they &s;hall be puni&s;hable, and moreover bound in their per&s;ons and e&s;tates to make full &s;atisfaction and reparation for all damages, of what&s;oever nature the &s;ame may be.</P>
<P>The&s;e prohibitions are conformable with the laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> U|nited States: If under colour of authority, tho&s;e to whom the &s;ame does not relate, &s;hall receive injury, the act, according to its circum&s;tances, is an offence, for which the offender is not only an&s;werable to his own country, but moreover to the injur|ed party, to whom he is bound to make full and complete re|paration.</P>
<P>The open and explicit views of the parties, and their mu|tual engagement to put this law in execution again&s;t all offend|ers, will be a &s;alutary check upon the too frequent irregulari|ties that occur in the cour&s;e of war between maritime nations. The paragraph is a copy of a &s;imilar one contained in the fif|teenth article of the commercial treaty between France and Great Britain, concluded in 1786, and agrees with the four|teenth article of our treaty with Holland. In order to guard &s;till more effectually again&s;t the injuries to which the citizens and &s;ubjects may be expo&s;ed from the private &s;hips of war of each other, the next paragraph &s;tipulates, that all commanders of privateers, before they receive their commi&s;&s;ions, &s;hall be &s;ub|jected to give &s;ecurity, by at lea&s;t two re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ureties, who have no intere&s;t in the privateer, in the &s;um of fifteen hundred pounds &s;terling, or &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix dol|lars; or, if the privateer is manned with more than one hun|dred and fifty men, in the &s;um of three thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling, or thirteen thou&s;and three hundred and thirty-three dol|lars, to &s;atisfy all damages and injuries committed by &s;uch pri|vateers, her officers, or any of her men, again&s;t the tenor of the treaty, or the laws and in&s;tructions for the regulation of their conduct; and in ca&s;e of aggre&s;&s;ion, the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch privateer &s;hall be re-called and made void.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="028389_0818_0FD8EF7197701770">
This particular regulation has been frequently introduced in modern treaties, and exi&s;ts in this preci&s;e &s;hape in the la&s;t trea|ty of commerce beeween France and Great Britain; I have found no in&s;tance where a larger &s;um has been mentioned. It has, with little con&s;ideration, been made an objection to this regulation, that the amount of the bonds are not adequate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> compen&s;ate or &s;atisfy the damages that may be committed by the&s;e privateers.</P>
<P>The preceding part of the article gives the injured party a remedy again&s;t the per&s;ons and e&s;tates of the aggre&s;&s;ors; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bonds are not required for the exclu&s;ive purpo&s;e of being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fund, to which the injured may have recour&s;e for &s;atisfaction; but principally for the purpo&s;e of excluding from the command of privateers, tho&s;e di&s;&s;olute and irregular characters, who are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">trained by either moral or political ties, and for who&s;e good behaviour, re&s;pon&s;ible and di&s;intere&s;ted men would not become bond&s;men. The &s;ame principle is developed in the civil admini&s;tration of every nation. In ca&s;es of pecuniary tru&s;t, it is a common and u&s;eful precaution, to require &s;urety for the faithful di&s;charge of the office; and the principal advantage of this regulation is to &s;ecure the employment of virtuous and up|right officers. The amount of the bonds required on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions is &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, though inferior to the pro|perty confided to them.</P>
<P>Thus the trea&s;urer of the United States, who has the cu&s;|tody of millions, gives bonds for only one hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars, the collectors of New York and Philadelphia for fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars; &s;ums very far &s;hort of the public money of which they are in the receipt, yet &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the public again&s;t characters of doubtful integrity. The adequacy of the &s;ums, in the particular ca&s;e, is moreover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|denced by the law and practice of our own country. In the re|&s;olution of congre&s;s, of the third of April 1776, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> far as regards this point, remained in force throughout the A|merican war, congre&s;s required that the commander of ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y privateer, before his commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be delivered to him, &s;hould give bonds, with &s;ureties, to the pre&s;ident of congre&s;s, in the &s;um of five thou&s;and dollars, if the ve&s;&s;el was of or un|der one hundred tons; and of ten thou&s;and dollars, if the ve&s;|&s;el was upwards of one hundred tons, to ob&s;erve the rules and in&s;tructions pre&s;cribed for their government. The&s;e &s;ums are one quarter le&s;s than the&s;e required by the article before us.</P>
<P>The la&s;t paragraph requiring the judges of the admiralty courts to furni&s;h formal and du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y authenticated copies of their proceedings in ca&s;es of the condemnation of ve&s;&s;els or cargoes,
<PB N="243" REF="028389_0819_0FD8EF733B636A38">belonging to the citizens or &s;ubjects of the parties, is pur&s;uant to that rea&s;onable cour&s;e of proceeding, which ought always in this and &s;imilar ca&s;es to prevail.</P>
<P>The twentieth article, which is in prevention of piracy, has the &s;anction of numerous precedents. A pirate is the common enemy of all mankind.&mdash;All, therefore, &s;hould unite in refu&s;ing him a&s;&s;i&s;tance and refuge, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch re|gulations relative to the &s;ale of his plunder, as, by &s;hutting again&s;t him every market, may thereby annihilate the motives to his piracy.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t article &s;tipulates, that the citizens and &s;ub|jects of the parties, &s;hall do no acts of ho&s;tility or violence again&s;t each other, nor accept commi&s;&s;ions or in&s;tructions &s;o to act from any foreign &s;tate being an enemy to the other par|ty.&mdash;That the enemies of either nation &s;hall not be allowed to invite, or endeavour to enli&s;t, in their military &s;ervice, any of the citizens or &s;ubjects of the other; and the laws, prohibit|ing &s;uch offences, are to be punctually executed. The article farther &s;tipulates, if any citizen or &s;ubject of either party, who has accepted of a foreign commi&s;&s;ion to arm a privateer again&s;t the other, it &s;hall be lawful for the &s;aid party to treat and pu|ni&s;h the &s;aid citizen or &s;ubject, <HI>having &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as a pirate.</P>
<P>The general tenor of this article is in comformity with the &s;pirit of our preceding laws on this &s;ubject; it is moreover in perfect uni&s;on with the duties of neutrality; tho&s;e duties which a ju&s;t regard to the principles of integrity, as well as our en|lightened pur&s;uit of our own intere&s;t, require us faithfully to perform.</P>
<P>Two objections have been offered again&s;t this article; one, that it precludes &s;uch of our citizens as, with a view of acquir|ing military knowledge, would otherwi&s;e engage volunteers in foreign &s;ervice&mdash;the other, that it makes every citizen and &s;ub|ject, of either party, who has accepted a foreign commi&s;&s;ion to arm a privateer again&s;t the other, and who &s;hall be taken in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion, liable to be puni&s;hed as a pirate.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the fir&s;t objection, if, by a rigorous con&s;tructi|on, the ca&s;e is included within the prohibition, it &s;hould be re|marked, that it is applicable only to &s;uch engagements as com|mence and are made in time of mutual war. If we have citi|zens, who, with the view of military education, are inclined to engage in foreign &s;ervice, though from pa&s;t experience there is not much rea&s;on to conclude that the examples would be nu|merous, they have full &s;cope, as I under&s;tand the article, in the periods of peace, to enter into any of the regular armies of
<PB N="244" REF="028389_0820_0FD8EF77583F0FD0">Europe, that they may prefer; and being thus engaged, they are free to make the campaigns of war again&s;t Great Britain, if that is their pa&s;&s;ion, without injuring this article.

<P>The &s;econd objection has even le&s;s plau&s;ibility than the fir&s;t; the di&s;ingenuous means that have been u&s;ed to excite a rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|bation of this clau&s;e of the article, manife&s;t the want of truth and patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e who have employed them: pa&s;&s;ion and the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition have a&s;&s;erted, that the provi&s;ion before us is &s;o exten&s;ive as to place the &s;ubordinate officers and private men, on board of a privateer, within the predicament of her commander; nay, that all per&s;ons, citizens, or &s;ubjects, of ei|ther nation, who would accept commi&s;&s;ions, or enter, in any capacity, in a foreign army or navy, would, in con&s;equence of this &s;tipulation, be liable to be treated and puni&s;hed as pi|rates. It is &s;ufficient, after noticing the&s;e attempts to impo&s;e upon the public, to ob&s;erve that the &s;tipulation <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> con|fines the puni&s;hment, in que&s;tion, to the commanders of pri|vateers, who, contrary to the laws of the land, and the clear and equitable obligations of the members of a neutral nation, &s;hall be taken with &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion; and that it does not ex|tend to the under officers or crew, much le&s;s to &s;uch per&s;ons, as contrary to the preceding inhibition of the article, &s;hould accept commi&s;&s;ions in a foreign army or navy. In re&s;pect to &s;uch mi&s;|demeanors in all ca&s;es (except that of equipping and command|ing a privateer, which will expo&s;e the commander, when taken, to be puni&s;hed as a pirate) the offence is cognizable only by the nation within who&s;e juri&s;diction the offence is committed, or of which the offender is a citizen, or &s;ubject; and, by our laws, is puni&s;hable only by fine and impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>A perver&s;ion of the &s;en&s;e of the clau&s;e, &s;tipulating, that "the law again&s;t all &s;uch offences and aggre&s;&s;ions &s;hall be punc|tually executed," has been attempted, though nothing can be be more innocent or unexceptionable. Its plain meaning is, that each party, in the ca&s;es falling within its juri&s;diction, &s;hall faithfully put in execution its own laws again&s;t the offences and aggre&s;&s;ions, in contravention of the article. A &s;tipulation be|tween the governments, to execute laws on a certain &s;ubject, can mean nothing el&s;e than that each &s;hall execute its own laws on that &s;ubject, in the ca&s;es appertaining to its juri&s;dic|tion.</P>
<P>Though mo&s;t of the objections preferred again&s;t the treaty are marked with that illiberal &s;pirit which characterizes the
<PB N="245" REF="028389_0821_0FD8EF79CECD7978">party who have uncea&s;ingly laboured to bring into di&s;credit the government of the country, yet few of them have been le&s;s veiled than this which condemns a &s;tipulation intended to curb and re&s;train the few di&s;&s;olute and daring characters, who, from the lea&s;t worthy of all motives that lead to military enterprize, might otherwi&s;e engage in this piratical warfare.</P>
<P>What virtuous citizen would feel him&s;elf ju&s;tified in accept|ing &s;uch command? What mu&s;t be the morals of tho&s;e in|&s;tructors, who contend for a freedom to commit, what human|ity and honor forbid? Every treaty that we have concluded with other nations, is enriched with this &s;tipulation; not only our own treaties but tho&s;e between other nations contain it. How is it that we no where di&s;cover a trace of di&s;approbation, either on the part of our &s;tate&s;men, or from an enlightened people, again&s;t a &s;eries of treaties, formed by different public mini&s;ters, and ratified by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, each of which contains a provi&s;ion that the crime of accepting a foreign commi&s;&s;ion to arm and command a privateer, again&s;t a nation with whom we are at peace, &s;hall be treated and puni&s;hed as piracy? Is it that our virtue has become le&s;s &s;evere? our mo|rality more indulgent? or is it that our predece&s;&s;ors were le&s;s vigilant in defending the rights of the citizens, than the o&s;ten|tatious patriots of the pre&s;ent day?

<P>If France was free, fir&s;t to form the&s;e &s;tipulations with us, in 1778, notwith&s;tanding her prior and exi&s;ting treaty with us, we mu&s;t be equally free in a treaty with the &s;ame, or any other power, to agree to &s;imilar &s;tipulations. Both were free, and neither violates their former engagements, by a&s;&s;enting, as we have done, to the&s;e &s;tipulations in a po&s;terior treaty.</P>
<P>It is further alleged, that the&s;e articles are injurious to the intere&s;t of the United States, becau&s;e they prohibit, in certain ca&s;es, foreign privateers to rendezvous in our ports, and to &s;ell within our territory, the prizes they may have taken.&mdash;If it is de&s;irable to render out principal &s;ea ports and cities &s;cenes of riot and confu&s;ion, if it is politic to divide our citizens, by in|fu&s;ing into their minds the ho&s;tile &s;pirit with which the nations at war are animated again&s;t each other, if we are prepared to &s;ee the pro&s;tration of public authority, and to behold the laws trampled upon by armed banditti, if we are ready to invite our citizens to abandon their regular and u&s;eful employments, and to engage, as adventurers, even again&s;t each other, in the pur|&s;uit of plunder, then is the objection well-founded, then is the re&s;traint pernicious, then is the &s;tipulation worthy of condem|nation &mdash;But if to e&s;tabli&s;h the rever&s;e of all this, is the effort and aim of every wi&s;e and prudent government, the &s;tipulation in que&s;tion demands the approbation of all virtuous citizens.</P>
<P>But were none of the&s;e con&s;equences to be apprehended from the free admi&s;&s;ion of the privateers of all nations engaged in war, and the permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ell their plunder, it would, not|with&s;tanding, be again&s;t the intere&s;ts of the United States to allow the &s;ame.

<P>IT is now time to fulfil my promi&s;e of an examination of the con&s;titutionality of the treaty. Of all the objections which have been contrived again&s;t this in&s;trument, tho&s;e relating to this point are the mo&s;t futile&mdash;If there be a political problem capable of complete demon&s;tration, the con&s;titutionality of the treaty, in all its parts, is of this &s;ort&mdash;It is even difficult to be|lieve, that any man in either hou&s;e of congre&s;s, who values his reputation for di&s;cernment or &s;incerity, will publicly hazard it by a &s;erious attempt to controvert the po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is, neverthele&s;s, too much a fa&s;hion with &s;ome politicians, when hard pre&s;&s;ed on the expediency of a mea&s;ure, to entrench them&s;elves behind objections to its con&s;titutionality&mdash;Aware that there is naturally in the public mind a jealous &s;en&s;ibility to objections of that nature, which may predi&s;po&s;e again&s;t a thing otherwi&s;e acceptable, if even a doubt, in this re&s;pect, can be rai&s;ed&mdash;They have been too forward to take advantage of this propen&s;ity, without weighing the real mi&s;chief of the example. For, however it may &s;erve a temporary purpo&s;e, its ultimate tendency is, by accu&s;toming the people to ob&s;erve, that alarms of this kind are repeated with levity and without cau&s;e, to pre|pare them for di&s;tru&s;ting the cry of danger, when it may be real: Yet the imprudence has been &s;uch, that there has &s;carcely been an important public que&s;tion, which has not involved more or le&s;s of this &s;pecies of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the motives of tho&s;e who may incline to defeat the treaty, are unu&s;ually &s;trong for creating, if po&s;&s;ible, a doubt concerning its con&s;titutionality.</P>
<P>The treaty, having been ratified on both &s;ides, the dilemma plainly is between a violation of the con&s;titution, by the treaty, and a violation of the con&s;titution, by ob&s;tructing the execution of the treaty.</P>
<P>The VIth. article of the con&s;titution of the United States, declares, that "the con&s;titution and the laws of the United States, made in pur&s;uance thereof, all <HI>treaties made, or which &s;hall be made under the authority of the United States,</HI> &s;hall <HI>be the &s;upreme law of the land,</HI> any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding." A law of the land, till revoked or annulled, by the competent authority, is binding, not le&s;s on each branch or department of the government than on each individual of the &s;ociety&mdash;Each hou&s;e of congre&s;s collectively, as well as the members of it &s;eparately, are under a con&s;titutional obligation to ob&s;erve the injunctions of a pre|exi&s;ting
<PB N="254" REF="028389_0830_0FD8EF8CC4738E90">law, and to give it effect.&mdash;If they act otherwi&s;e, they infringe the con&s;titution; the theory of which knows, in &s;uch ca&s;e, no di&s;cretion on their part&mdash;To re&s;ort to fir&s;t principles for their ju&s;tification, in a&s;&s;uming &s;uch a di&s;cretion, is to go out of the con&s;titution for an authority, which they cannot find in it&mdash;it is to u&s;urp the original character of the people them&s;elves&mdash;it is, in principle, to pro&s;trate the government.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es mu&s;t be very extraordinary that can excu&s;e &s;o vio|lent an a&s;&s;umption of di&s;cretion. They mu&s;t be of a kind to authorize a revolution in government;&mdash;for every re&s;ort to ori|ginal principles, in derogation from the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution, partakes of this character.</P>
<P>Recalling to view, that all but the fir&s;t ten articles of the treaty are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able to expire at the termination of two years af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the pre&s;ent war; if the objection to it in point of con&s;titution|ality cannot be &s;upported&mdash;let me a&s;k, who is the man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> enough to maintain, that the in&s;trument is of &s;uch a nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to ju&s;tify a revolution in government?</P>
<P>If this can be an&s;wered in the affirmative, adieu to all the &s;ecurities which nations expect to derive from con&s;titutions of government. They become mere bubbles, &s;ubject to be blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> away by every breath of party&mdash;The precedent would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|tal one&mdash;Our government, from being fixed and limited, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> become revolutionary and arbitrary&mdash;All the provi&s;ions which our con&s;titution, with &s;o much &s;olemnity, ordains "for for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tic tranquility, providing for the common defence, prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the general welfare, and &s;ecuring the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;elves and po&s;terity," evaporate and di&s;appear&mdash;</P>
<P>Equally will this be the ca&s;e, if the rage of party &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> meditate, if the momentary a&s;cendency of party, in a participle branch of the government, can effect, and if the people can be &s;o deceived as to tolerate&mdash;that the <HI>pretence</HI> of a violation of the con&s;titution &s;hall be made the in&s;trument of its actual vio|lation.</P>
<P>This, however, cannot be&mdash;There are already convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> indications on the very &s;ubject before us, that the good &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the people will triumph over prejudice and the acts of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &mdash;that they will finally decide according to their true intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and that any tran&s;ient or partial &s;uperiority, which may exi&s;t, if abu&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of infracting the con&s;titution, will con|&s;ign the perpetrators of the infraction to ruin and di&s;grace.

<P><PB N="255" REF="028389_0831_0FD8EF949FC76428">
It is time to enter on the momentous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The que&s;tion &s;hall be examined in the four following views&mdash;1. In relation to the theory of the con&s;titution&mdash;2. In relation to the manner in which it was under&s;tood by the convention who framed it, and by the people who adopted it&mdash;3. In relation to the practice upon a &s;imilar power in the confederation&mdash;4. In relation to the practice under our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, prior to the treaty with Great Britain&mdash;In all the&s;e views, the con&s;titutionality of the treaty can be vindicated beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;erious doubt.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the theory of the con&s;titution&mdash;The con&s;titution of the United States di&s;tributes its powers into three departments, legi&s;lative, executive, judiciary.&mdash;The fir&s;t article defines the &s;tructure, and &s;pecifies the various powers, of the legi&s;lative de|partment&mdash;The &s;econd article e&s;tabli&s;hes the organization and powers of the executive department&mdash;The third article does the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the judiciary department&mdash;The fourth and fifth, and &s;ixth articles, which are the la&s;t, are a mi&s;cellany of particular provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article declares that "all <HI>legi&s;lative power</HI> granted by the con&s;titution &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a congre&s;s of the United States, which &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of a &s;enate and a hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives."</P>
<P>The &s;econd article, which organizes and regulates the exe|cutive department, declares that the <HI>"executive power</HI> &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a pre&s;ident of the United States of America;" and proceeding to detail particular authorities of the executive, it declares that the "pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, <HI>to make treaties,</HI> provided two-thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur." There is in no part of the con&s;titution any explanation of this power to make treaties, any definition of its objects, or delineation of its bounds&mdash;The only other provi&s;ion in the con&s;titution re&s;pecting it, is in the &s;ixth article, which provides, as already noticed, that all treaties made or which &s;hall be made under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land;&mdash;and this notwith|&s;tanding any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for words more comprehen&s;ive to be u&s;ed than tho&s;e which grant the power to make treaties. They are &s;uch as would naturally be employed to confer a <HI>plenipotentiary</HI> authority&mdash;A power "to make treaties," granted in the&s;e in|definite terms, extends to all kinds of treaties, and with all the latitude which &s;uch a power, under any form of government, can po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;the power <HI>"to make"</HI> implies a power to act <HI>autho|ritatively</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="028389_0832_0FD8EF9590E1ABA8">and <HI>conclu&s;ively,</HI> independent of the after-clau&s;e which expre&s;sly places treaties among the &s;upreme laws of the land. The thing to be made is a treaty.</P>
<P>With regard to the objects of the treaty, there being no &s;pe|cification, there is, of cour&s;e, a <HI>charte blanche.</HI> The general propo&s;ition mu&s;t, therefore, be, that whatever is a proper &s;ub|ject of compact, between nation and nation, may be embraced by a treaty between the pre&s;ident of the United States, with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, and the corre&s;pondent organ of a foreign &s;tate.</P>
<P>The authority being general, it comprizes, of cour&s;e, what|ever cannot be &s;hown to be nece&s;&s;arily an exception to it.</P>
<P>The only con&s;titutional exception to the power of making treaties is, that it &s;hall not change the con&s;titution; which re&s;ults from this fundamental maxim, that a delegated authority cannot alter the con&s;tituting act, unle&s;s &s;o expre&s;sly authorized by the con&s;tituting power. An agent cannot new-model his own commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;A treaty, for example, cannot transfer the legi&s;|lative power to the executive department, nor the power of this la&s;t department to the judiciary; in other words, it cannot &s;ti|pulate that the pre&s;ident, and not congre&s;s, &s;hall make laws for the United States, that the judges, and not the pre&s;ident, &s;hall-command the national forces.</P>
<P>Again, there is al&s;o a <HI>national</HI> exception to the power of making treaties, as there is to every other delegated power, which re&s;pects abu&s;es of authority in palpable and extre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me ca&s;es. On natural principles, a treaty, which &s;hould manife&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> betray or &s;acrifice the private intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, would be null. But this pre&s;ents a que&s;tion foreign from that of the modifica|tion or di&s;tribution of con&s;titutional powers. It applies to the ca&s;e of the pernicious exerci&s;e of a power, where there is legal competency. Thus the power of treaty, though extend|ing to the right of making alliances offen&s;ive and defen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, might not be exerci&s;ed in making an alliance, &s;o injurious to the &s;tate as to ju&s;tify the non-ob&s;ervance of the contract.</P>
<P>Beyond the&s;e exceptions to the power, none occurs that can be &s;upported.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which have been in&s;i&s;ted upon, towards invalidating the treaty with Great Britain, are not even plau&s;ible. They amount to this, that a treaty can e&s;tabli&s;h nothing between the United States and a foreign nation, which it is the province of the legi&s;lative authority to regulate in reference to the United States alone. It cannot, for in&s;tance, e&s;tabli&s;h a parti|cular rule of commercial intercour&s;e between the United States and Great Britain; becau&s;e it is provided in the con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="257" REF="028389_0833_0FD8EF994A49A6D8">that congre&s;s <HI>"&s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations."</HI> This is equivalent to affirming that all the ob|jects upon which the legi&s;lative power may act, in relation to our country, are excepted out of the power to make treaties.</P>
<P>Two obvious con&s;iderations refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e this doctrine. One, that the power to make treaties, and the power to make laws, are different things, operating by different means, upon different &s;ubjects; the other, that the con&s;truction re&s;ulting from &s;uch a doctrine would defeat the power to make treaties, while its oppo&s;ite reconciles this power with the power of making laws.</P>
<P>The power to make laws is, "the power of pronouncing authoritatively the will of the nation as to all per&s;ons and things over which it has juri&s;diction:" or it may be defined to be "the power of pre&s;cribing rules binding upon all per&s;ons and things over which the nation has juri&s;diction." It acts com|pul&s;ively upon all per&s;ons, whether foreigners or citizens, and upon all things within the territory of &s;uch nation, and al&s;o upon its own citizens and their property without its territory in certain ca&s;es and under certain limitations. But it can have no obligatory action what&s;oever upon a foreign nation or upon any per&s;on or thing within the juri&s;diction of a foreign na|tion.</P>
<P>The power of treaty, on the other hand, is the power by <HI>agreement, convention,</HI> or <HI>compact,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h rules binding upon two or more nations, their re&s;pective citizens and property. The rule e&s;tabli&s;hed derives its reciprocal obligation from pro|mi&s;e, from the faith which the contracting parties pledge to each other&mdash;not from the power of either to pre&s;cribe a rule for the other. It is not here the will of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> that com|mands; it is the con&s;ent of two independent parties that con|tract.</P>
<P>The <HI>means</HI> which the power of legi&s;lation employs, are <HI>laws</HI> which it enacts, or rules which it enjoins; the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> upon which it acts is the nation of whom it is, the per&s;ons and pro|perty within the juri&s;diction of the nation. The <HI>means,</HI> which the power of treaty employs, are <HI>contracts</HI> with other nations, who may or may not enter into them&mdash;The <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> upon which it acts are the nations contracting and tho&s;e per&s;ons and things of each to which the contract relates&mdash;Though a treaty may effect what a law can, yet a law cannot effect what a treaty does. The&s;e di&s;criminations are obvious and deci&s;ive; and how|ever the operation of a treaty may, in &s;ome things, re&s;emble that of a law, no two ideas are more di&s;tinct, than that of <HI>legi&s;|lating</HI> and that of <HI>contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="028389_0834_0FD8EFA0964A92D0">
It follows that there is no ground for the inference pretended to be drawn, that the legi&s;lative powers of congre&s;s are ex|cepted out of the power of making treaties. It is the province of the latter to do what the former cannot do&mdash;Congre&s;s (to pur&s;ue &s;till the ca&s;e of regulating trade) may regulate by law, our own trade and that which foreigners come to carry on with us; but they cannot regulate the trade which we may go to carry on <HI>in foreign</HI> countries; they can give to us no rights, no privileges there. This mu&s;t depend on the will and regulations of tho&s;e countries; and, con&s;equently, it is the province of the power of treaty to e&s;tabli&s;h the rules of commercial intercour&s;e <HI>between</HI> foreign nations and the United States. The legi&s;lative may regulate our own trade, but treaty only can regulate the national trade between our own and another country.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution accordingly con&s;iders the power of treaty as different from that of legi&s;lation. This is proved in two ways, I. That while the con&s;titution declares that all the <HI>legi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tive</HI> powers which it grants &s;hall be ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, it ve&s;ts the power of making treaties in <HI>the pre&s;ident</HI> with con&s;ent of the &s;enate. II. That the &s;ame article by which it is declared that the <HI>executive</HI> power &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a pre&s;ident, and in which &s;undry executive powers are detailed, gives the power to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> treaties to the pre&s;ident, with the auxiliary agency of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|nate. Thus the power of making treaties is placed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of executive authorities; while the force of laws is annexed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its re&s;ults. This agrees with the di&s;tribution commonly ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by theoretical writers, though perhaps the power of treaty, from its peculiar nature, ought to form a cla&s;s by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When it is &s;aid, that congre&s;s &s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, this has reference to the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tribution of the general legi&s;lative power of regulating trade between the national and the particular governments; and &s;erves merely to di&s;tingui&s;h the right of regulating our external trade, as far as it can be done by law, which is ve&s;ted in congre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from that of regulating the trade of a &s;tate within it&s;elf, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is left to each &s;tate.</P>
<P>This will the better appear from the entire clau&s;e. "The con|gre&s;s &s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign na|tions and among the &s;everal &s;tates and with the Indian tribes," which is the &s;ame as if it had been &s;aid, The whole powers of regulating trade <HI>by law</HI> &s;hall re&s;ide in congre&s;s, except as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the trade within a &s;tate, the power to regulate which &s;hall re|main with &s;uch &s;tate. But it is clearly foreign to that mutual regulation of trade between the United States and other nations, which, from the nece&s;&s;ity of mutual con&s;ent, can only be per|formed
<PB N="259" REF="028389_0835_0FD8EFA19381E198">by treaty. It is indeed an ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that the power of regulating trade by law is incompatible with the power of regulating it by treaty; &s;ince the former can, by no means, do what the latter can alone accompli&s;h; con&s;equently, it is an ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that the <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> power of regulating trade is an exception to the power of making treaties.</P>
<P>Laws are the acts of legi&s;lation of a particular nation for it&s;elf. Treaties are the acts of the legi&s;lation of &s;everal nations for them&s;elves jointly and reciprocally.

<P>IT &s;hall now be &s;hown, that the objections to the treaty, founded on its pretended interference with the power of congre&s;s, tend to render the power of making treaties, in a very great degree, if not altogether, nominal&mdash;This will be be&s;t &s;een by an enumeration of the ca&s;es of pretended inter|ference.</P>

<P N="4">4th, The power of congre&s;s "to define and puni&s;h piracies and felonies, committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations," is &s;aid to be contravened by tho&s;e parts of the treaty, which declare that certain acts &s;hall be deemed pi|racy, which con&s;titute certain other things offences, and &s;tipu|late the reciprocal puni&s;hment of them by each.</P>
<P N="5">5th, It is al&s;o &s;aid that the con&s;titution is violated, in relation to that provi&s;ion which declares, that "no money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury but in con&s;equence of appropriations made by law"&mdash;by tho&s;e parts of the treaty which &s;tipulate compen|&s;ations to certain commi&s;&s;ioners, and indemnifications to Great Britain, in certain ca&s;es to be adju&s;ted and pronounced by the commi&s;&s;ioners; and generally, by all tho&s;e parts which may involve an expenditure of money.</P>

<P>La&s;tly, The con&s;titution is &s;aid to be violated, in its provi|&s;ions concerning the judiciary department, by tho&s;e parts of the treaty which contemplate the confiding to the determina|tion of commi&s;&s;ioners certain que&s;tions between the two na|tions.</P>

<P><PB N="261" REF="028389_0837_0FD8EFA489208470">
It mu&s;t have been ob&s;erved that the argument in the la&s;t number is applicable to all the legi&s;lative powers of congre&s;s, as well as to that of regulating trade, which was &s;elected, by way of illu&s;tration, on the ground of its being common to all&mdash;Indeed the in&s;tance of the regulations of trade is that which is mo&s;t favorable to the oppo&s;ite doctrine&mdash;Since foreign na|tions are named in the clau&s;e; the true intent of which, how|ever, has been explained.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning, too, would extend the power of treaties to tho&s;e objects which are con&s;igned to the legi&s;lation of indi|vidual &s;tates; but here the con&s;titution has announced its mean|ing in expre&s;s terms, by declaring, that the treaties which have been and &s;hall be made under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tand|ing&mdash;This manife&s;tly recognizes the &s;upremacy of the power of treaties over the laws of particular &s;tates, and goes even a &s;tep farther.</P>
<P>The obvious rea&s;on for this &s;pecial provi&s;ion, in regard to the laws of individual &s;tates, is, that there might otherwi&s;e have been room for que&s;tion&mdash;whether a treaty of the union could embrace objects, the internal regulation of which be|longed to the &s;eparate authorities of the &s;tates. But with regard to the United States there was no room for a &s;imilar que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The power of treaty could not but be &s;uppo&s;ed commen&s;urate with all the&s;e objects to which the legi&s;lative power of the uni|on extended, which are the proper &s;ubjects of compacts with foreign nations.</P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion among &s;ome theoretical writers&mdash;whether a treaty can repeal <HI>pre-exi&s;ting laws?</HI> This que&s;tion mu&s;t always be an&s;wered by the particular form of government of each na|tion. In our con&s;titution, which gives, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> the force of law, to treaties, making them equal with the acts of congre&s;s, the &s;upreme law of the land, a treaty mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily repeal an antecedent law contrary to it; according to the legal maxim that <HI>"leges po&s;teriores priores contrarias abrogant."</HI></P>
<P>But even in tho&s;e forms of government, in which there may be room for &s;uch a que&s;tion, it is not under&s;tood that a treaty containing &s;tipulations which require the repeal of antecedent laws, is, on that account, uncon&s;titutional and null. The true meaning is, that the antecedent laws are not, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> abro|gated by the treaty&mdash;But the legi&s;lature is, neverthele&s;s, bound in good faith, under the general limitation, &s;tated in another place, to lend its authority to remove ob&s;tacles which previous laws might oppo&s;e to a fair execution of a treaty.</P>

One in&s;tance of the incon&s;i&s;tency, prevailing in the argu|ments again&s;t the treaty, negociated by Mr. Jay, is ob&s;ervable in this point. To get rid of the infractions of our treaty of peace with Great Britain by certain laws of particular &s;tates, it is &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uou&s;ly maintained that treaties controul the laws of &s;tates. To impeach the con&s;titutionality of the treaty under con&s;ideration, it is objected, that, in &s;ome points, it interferes with the objects of &s;tate legi&s;lation. The expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the con&s;titution in this particular, quoted above, has not been &s;ufficient to check the rage for objection.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of the alleged interferences will fully appear, by &s;howing how they would operate upon the &s;everal kinds of treaties u&s;ual among nations. The&s;e may be cla&s;&s;ed under three principal heads.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Treaties of commerce,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Treaties of alli|ance,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Treaties of peace.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Treaties of commerce are, of cour&s;e, excluded; for every treaty of commerce is a &s;y&s;tem of rules devi&s;ed to regulate and govern the trade between contracting nations; invading directly the exclu&s;ive power of regulating trade which is attributed to congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Treaties of alliance, whether defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive, are eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly excluded, and this on two grounds&mdash;1. Becau&s;e it is their im|mediate object to decline a ca&s;e or ca&s;es in which one nation &s;hall take part with another in war, contrary, in the &s;en&s;e of the objection, to that clau&s;e of the con&s;titution which gives to congre&s;s the power of declaring war; and 2. Becau&s;e the &s;uc|cours &s;tipulated, in whatever &s;hape they may be, mu&s;t involve an expenditure of money&mdash;not to &s;ay, that it is common to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|pulate &s;uccours in money, either in the fir&s;t in&s;tance or by way of alternative. It will be pertinent to ob&s;erve incidentally, in this place, that even the humane and laudable provi&s;ion in the &s;eventeenth article, which all have approved, is within the &s;pi|rit of the objection; for the effect of this is to re&s;train the power and di&s;cretion of congre&s;s to grant repri&s;als, till there has been an un&s;ucce&s;sful demand of ju&s;tice. Nothing can bet|ter illu&s;trate the unrea&s;onable tendency of the principle.</P>
<P>Treaties of peace are al&s;o excluded, or, at the lea&s;t, are &s;o narrowed as to be in the greate&s;t number of ca&s;es impracticable &mdash;The mo&s;t common conditions of the&s;e treaties are re&s;titutions or ce&s;&s;ions of territory, on one &s;ide or on the other, frequently on both &s;ides, regulations of boundary&mdash;re&s;titutions and con|firmations of property&mdash;pecuniary indemnifications for inju|ries or expen&s;es&mdash;It will, probably, not be ea&s;y to find a pre|cedent of a treaty of peace, which does not contain one or more of the&s;e provi&s;ions, as the ba&s;is of the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;ti|lities,
<PB N="263" REF="028389_0839_0FD8EFABE629DDF0">and they are all them naturally to be looked for in an agreement which is to put an end to the &s;tate of war between conflicting nations.</P>
<P>Yet they are all precluded by the objections which have been enumerated: pecuniary indemnifications, by that which re&s;pects the appropriations of money; re&s;titutions or ce&s;&s;ions of terri|tory or property, regulations of boundary, by that which re|&s;pects the right of congre&s;s to di&s;po&s;e of, and make all needful rules and regulations concerning the territory and property of the United States&mdash;It is to be ob&s;erved, likewi&s;e, that ce&s;&s;ions of territory are almo&s;t always accompanied with &s;tipulations in favor of tho&s;e, who inhabit the ceded territory, &s;ecuring per|&s;onal privileges and private rights of property; neither of which could be acceded to on the principles of that objection, which relates to the power of naturalization; for this power has reference to two &s;pecies of rights, tho&s;e of privilege and tho&s;e of prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y. And act allowing a foreigner to hold real e&s;tate is &s;o far an act of naturalization; &s;ince it is one of the con&s;equences of alieni&s;m, not to be able to hold real e&s;tate.</P>
<P>It follows, that if the objections which are taken to the treaty, on the point of con&s;titutionality, are valid, the pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, can make neither a treaty of commerce nor alliance, and rarely, if at all, a treaty of peace. It is probable, that on a minute analy&s;is, there is &s;carcely any &s;pecies of treaty which would not cla&s;h, in &s;ome particu|lar, with the principle of tho&s;e objections; and thus, as was before ob&s;erved, the power to make treaties, granted in &s;uch comprehen&s;ive and indefinite terms, and guarded with &s;o much precaution, would become e&s;&s;entially nugatory.</P>
<P>This is &s;o obviou&s;ly again&s;t the principles of &s;ound con&s;truc|tion, it, at the &s;ame time, expo&s;es the government to &s;o much impotence in one great branch of political power, in oppo&s;ition to a main intent of the con&s;titution&mdash;and it tends &s;o directly to fru&s;trate one principal object of the &s;ituation of a general government, the convenient management of our external con|cerns, that it cannot but be rejected by every di&s;cerning man who will examine and pronounce with &s;incerity. It is again&s;t the principles of &s;ound con&s;truction; becau&s;e the&s;e teach us, that every in&s;trument is &s;o to be interpreted, as that all the parts may, if po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;t with each other, and have their effect. But the con&s;truction which is combated would cau&s;e the legi&s;lative power to de&s;troy the power of making treaties. Moreover, if the power of the executive department be inade|quate to the making of the &s;everal kinds of treaties, which have been mentioned, there is, then, no power in the govern|ment
<PB N="264" REF="028389_0840_0FD8EFACD511AD40">to make them; for there is not a &s;yllable in the con&s;titu|tion which authorizes either the legi&s;lative or judiciary depart|ments, to make a treaty with a foreign nation. And our con|&s;titution would then exhibit the ridiculous &s;pectacle of a government without a power to make treaties with foreign na|tions: a re&s;ult as inadmi&s;&s;able as it is ab&s;urd; &s;ince, in fact, our con&s;titution grants the power of making treaties, in the mo&s;t explicit and ample terms, to the pre&s;ident, with the ad|vice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate. On the contrary, all difficulty is avoided, by di&s;tingui&s;hing the province of the two powers, according to ideas which have been always familiar to us, and which were never expo&s;ed to any que&s;tion till the treaty with Great Britain gave exerci&s;e to the &s;ubtilties of party &s;pirit.</P>
<P>By confining the power to make laws within its proper &s;phere, and re&s;tricting its actions to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of rules for our own nation and tho&s;e foreigners who come within our juri&s;diction&mdash;and by a&s;&s;igning to the power of treaty the office of concerting tho&s;e rules of mutual intercour&s;e and connexion, between us and foreign nations, which require their con&s;ent as well as our own; allowing to it the latitude nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, a harmonious agreement is pre&s;erved between the different powers of the government: that to make laws, and that to make treaties; between the authority of the legi&s;lative and the authority of the executive department&mdash;Hence,</P>
<P>Though congre&s;s, by the con&s;titution, have power to lay taxes, yet a treaty may re&s;train the exerci&s;e of it in particular ca&s;es. For a nation, like an individual, may abridge its moral power of action by agreement; and the organ charged with the legi&s;lative power of a nation may be re&s;trained in its ope|ration by the agreements of the organ of its <HI>federative</HI> power, or power to contract: let it be remembered, that the nation is the <HI>con&s;tituent,</HI> and that the executive, within its &s;phere, is no le&s;s the organ of its will than the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Though congre&s;s are empowered to make regulations of trade, yet they are not exclu&s;ively &s;o empowered&mdash;But regulations of trade may al&s;o be made by treaty; and, where other nations are to be bound by them, mu&s;t be made by treaty.</P>
<P>Though congre&s;s are authorized to e&s;tabli&s;h a uniform rule of naturalization, yet this contemplates only the ordinary ca&s;es of internal admini&s;tration, in particular and extraordinary ca&s;es, tho&s;e in which the preten&s;ions of a foreign government are to be managed&mdash;a treaty may al&s;o confer the rights and privileges of citizens; thus the ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ion and plenary dominion of a province or di&s;trict, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our arms in war, may be
<PB N="265" REF="028389_0841_0FD8EFAE4A0E7298">accepted by the treaty of peace, on the condition, that its inha|bitants &s;hall, in their per&s;ons and property enjoy the privileges of citizens.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to all the other in&s;tances of &s;up|po&s;ed infraction of the legi&s;lative authority:&mdash;with regard to piracies and offences again&s;t the laws of nations; with regard to expenditures of money, with regard to the appointment of officers, with regard to the judiciary tribunals, with regard to the di&s;po&s;al and regulation of the national territory and property &mdash;In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the power to make laws and the power to make treaties are concurrent and co-ordinate&mdash;The latter, and not the former, mu&s;t act, where the co-operation of other na|tions is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>As to what re&s;pects the commi&s;&s;ioners agreed to be appointed, they are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, <HI>officers.</HI> They are <HI>arbitrators</HI> between the two countries. Though in the con&s;titutions, both of the United States and of mo&s;t of the individual &s;tates, a particular mode of appointing officers is de&s;ignated&mdash;Yet, in practice, it has not been deemed a violation of the provi&s;ion to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners or &s;pecial agents for &s;pecial purpo&s;es, in a different mode.</P>
<P>As to the provi&s;ion, which re&s;tricts the i&s;&s;uing of money from the trea&s;ury, to ca&s;es of appropriation by law, and which, from its intrin&s;ic nature, may be con&s;idered as applicable to the exerci&s;e of every power of government, it is, in no &s;ort, touched by the treaty. In the con&s;tant practice of the government, the cau&s;e of an expenditure, or the contract which incurs it, is a different thing from the appropriation for &s;atisfying it. Thus the &s;alary of a public officer is fixed by one law, the appropri|ation for its payment by another. So, the treaty only &s;tipulates what may be a cau&s;e of expenditure. An appropriation by law will &s;till be requi&s;ite for actual payment.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;po&s;al and regulation of the territory and pro|perty of the United States, this will be naturally under&s;tood of di&s;po&s;itions and regulations purely dome&s;tic, and where the title is not di&s;puted by a foreign power. Where there are inter|fering claims of foreign powers, as neither will acknowledge the right of the other to decide, treaty mu&s;t directly or indi|rectly adju&s;t the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>So far then it is from being true, that the power of treaty can extend to nothing upon which, in relation to our&s;elves, the legi&s;lative power may act&mdash;that it may rather be laid down as a general rule, that a treaty may do between different nations whatever the legi&s;lative power of each may do with regard to it&s;elf. The exceptions to this rule are to be deduced from the
<PB N="266" REF="028389_0842_0FD8EFB1D6B7F6B8">unfitne&s;s and inconvenience of its application to particular ca&s;es, and are of the nature of abu&s;es of a general principle.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the power of legi&s;lation in its relations to the power of treaty, in&s;tead of &s;aying, that the objects of the former are excepted out of the latter, it will be more correct, indeed it will be entirely correct, to invert the rule, and to &s;ay, that the power of treaty is the power of making exceptions, in particular ca&s;es, to the power of legi&s;lation. The &s;tipulations of treaty are, in good faith, re&s;traints upon the exerci&s;e of the la&s;t mentioned power. Where there is no treaty, it is completely free to act. Where there is a treaty; it is &s;till free to act in all the ca&s;es not &s;pecially excepted by the treaty. Thus, congre&s;s is free to regulate trade with a foreign nation, with whom we have no treaty of commerce, in &s;uch manner as they judge for the intere&s;t of the United States; and they are al&s;o free &s;o to regulate it with a foreign nation with whom we have a treaty, in all the points which the treaty does not &s;pecially except. There is always, therefore, great latitude for the exerci&s;e of the legi&s;lative power of regulating trade with foreign nations, notwith&s;tanding any treaties of commerce which may be formed.</P>
<P>The effects of a treaty to impo&s;e re&s;traints upon the legi&s;la|tive power, may, in &s;ome degree, be exemplified by the ca&s;e of the compacts which the legi&s;lature it&s;elf makes, as with regard to the public debt. Its own compacts are, in good faith, exceptions to its power of action. Treaties with foreign powers, for obvious rea&s;ons, are much &s;tronger exceptions.</P>

<P>THE manner in which the power of treaty, as it exi&s;ts in the con&s;titution, was under&s;tood by the convention in framing it, and by the people in adopting it, is the point next to be con&s;idered.</P>

Two of the&s;e are in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, Mr. Madi&s;on and Mr. Baldwin: It is expected, by the adver|&s;aries of the treaty, that the&s;e gentlemen will, in their places, ob&s;truct its execution&mdash;However this may be, I feel a confi|dence that neither of them will deny the a&s;&s;ertion I have made&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e them capable of &s;uch a denial were to &s;uppo&s;e them utterly regardle&s;s of truth.

<P>Three members of the convention di&s;&s;ented from the con&s;ti|tution; Mr. Ma&s;on, Mr. Gerry, and Mr. Randolph. Among the rea&s;ons for his di&s;&s;ent, publi&s;hed by Mr. Ma&s;on, we find this clau&s;e, "By declaring all treaties &s;upreme laws of the land, the executive and &s;enate have, <HI>in many ca&s;es,</HI> an <HI>exclu&s;ive power of legi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation,</HI> which might have been avoided by proper di&s;tinctions with re&s;pect to treaties, and <HI>requiring the a&s;&s;ent of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives</HI> where it could be done with &s;afety." &mdash;This &s;hows the great extent of the power, in the conception of Mr. Ma&s;on: <HI>in many ca&s;es</HI> amounting to an <HI>exclu&s;ive power of legi&s;lation;</HI> nor did he object to the extent, but only de&s;ired that it &s;hould have been further guarded, by certain di&s;tincti|ons, and by requiring, in certain ca&s;es, the a&s;&s;ent of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Among the objections to the con&s;titution, addre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Gerry to the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, we find one to have been, "that treaties of the <HI>highe&s;t importance</HI> might be formed by the pre&s;ident, with the advice of two-thirds of a <HI>quorum</HI> of the &s;enate."&mdash;This &s;hows his idea of the magnitude of the power; and impliedly admitting with Mr. Ma&s;on, the propriety of its ex|tent, he &s;eems only to have de&s;ired that the concurrence of the &s;enate &s;hould have embraced two-thirds of the <HI>whole body,</HI> in&s;tead of two-thirds of a <HI>quorum.</HI> But how &s;mall and how in&s;ignificant would the power of treaty be, according to the doctrine lately promulgated, with regard to its con&s;titutional limit?</P>

As to the &s;en&s;e of the community in the adoption of the con|&s;titution, this can only be a&s;certained from two &s;ources, the writings for and again&s;t it, and the debates in the &s;everal &s;tate conventions&mdash;while it was under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I po&s;&s;e&s;s not, at this moment, materials for an inve&s;tigation, which would enable me to pre&s;ent the evidence they afford&mdash;But I refer to them, with confidence, for proof of the fact, that the organization of the power of treaty, in the cen&s;titution, was attacked and defended with an admi&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides, of its being of the character which I have a&s;&s;igned to it&mdash;Its great extent and importance&mdash;its effect to controul, by its &s;tipula|tions, the legi&s;lative authority, were mutually taken for granted, and, upon this ba&s;is, it was in&s;i&s;ted, by way of objection&mdash; that there were not adequate guards for the &s;afe exerci&s;e of &s;o va&s;t a power; that there ought to have been re&s;ervations of cer|tain rights, a <HI>better</HI> di&s;po&s;ition of the power to impeach, and a participation, general or &s;pecial, of the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives in the making of treaties.</P>
<P>The reply to the&s;e objections, acknowledging the delicacy and magnitude of the power, was directed to &s;how that its organization was a proper one, and that it was &s;ufficiently guarded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Federali&s;t No. XLII. has the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, "the power to make treaties and to receive and &s;end amba&s;&s;adors, &s;peak their own propriety&mdash;Both of them are compri&s;ed in the articles of confederation, <HI>with the difference only</HI> that the former is <HI>di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed</HI> by the plan of the convention, of an exception by which treaties might be &s;ub&s;tantially fru&s;trated by regulations of the &s;tates." This plainly alludes to the <HI>provi&s;o</HI> which has been cited and commented upon. "It is true that when treaties of commerce &s;tipulate for the appointment of articles, the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign con&s;uls may fall within the power of making commer|cial treaties." And in number LXIV. are the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, "the power of making treaties is an important one, e&s;pecially <HI>as it relates to war, peace and commerce;</HI> and it &s;hould not be delegated but in &s;uch a mode and with &s;uch precautions as will afford the <HI>highe&s;t &s;ecurity,</HI> that it will be exerci&s;ed by men the be&s;t qualified for the purpo&s;e, and in the manner mo&s;t conducive to the public good." There are few who will not admit, that the affairs of <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>navigation</HI> &s;hould be regu|lated by a &s;y&s;tem cautiou&s;ly formed and &s;teadily pur&s;ued, and that both our treaties and our laws &s;hould corre&s;pond with, and be made to promote it." "Some are di&s;plea&s;ed with it (that is, the power of treaty) not on account of any errors or defects in it, but becau&s;e, as the treaties, when made are to have the force of laws, they &s;hould be made only by men inve&s;ted with legi&s;lative autho|rity;" "others, though content that treaties &s;hould be made in the mode pro|po&s;ed, are aver&s;e to their being the <HI>&s;upreme law of the land.</HI>"
<P>It is generally under&s;tood that two per&s;ons were concerned in the writings of the&s;e papers, who, from having been members of the convention, had a good opportunity of knowing its views&mdash;and were under no temptation at that time, in this particular, to mi&s;repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>In the <HI>addre&s;s</HI> and rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent of the minority of the convention of Penn&s;ylvania to their con&s;tituents, "they &s;tate, that they had &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge&s;ted the following propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng others for an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> to the con&s;titution, "That no treaty which &s;hall be directly oppo&s;ed to the exi&s;ting laws of the United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall be valid <HI>until</HI> &s;uch laws &s;hall be repealed or made conformable to &s;uch treaty." This &s;hows that it was under&s;tood that the power of treaty in the con&s;titution extended to abrogating even pre-exi&s;ting laws of the United States, which was thought exceptionable; while no objection was made to the idea of its controuling future exerci&s;es of the legi&s;lative power&mdash; The &s;ame addre&s;s &s;tates, in another place, that the pre&s;ident and &s;enate "may form treaties with foreign nations, that may controul and abrogate the con&s;titu|tion and laws of the &s;everal &s;tates."</P>

The manner of exerci&s;ing a &s;imilar power under the <HI>confede|ration</HI> &s;hall now be examined.</P>
<P>To judge of the &s;imilarity of the power, it will be u&s;eful to quote the terms in which it was granted. They are the&s;e, "The United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right and power of <HI>entering into treaties and alli|ances, provided that no treaty of commerce</HI> &s;hall be made, whereby the legi&s;lative power of the re&s;pective &s;tates &s;hall be re&s;trained from impo&s;ing &s;uch impo&s;ts and duties on foreigners as their own people are &s;ubject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any &s;pecies of commodities what&s;oever." (Ar|ticle IX.)</P>
<P>It will not be di&s;puted that the words "treaties and alli|ances" are of equivalent import, and of no greater force than the &s;ingle word "treaties." An alliance is only a &s;pecies of treaty, a particular of a general;&mdash;and the power of "entering into treaties," which terms confer the authority under which the former government acted, will not be pretended to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ronger than the power "to make treaties," which are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rms con&s;tituting the authority under which the pre&s;ent govern|ment acts; it follows, that the power, re&s;pecting treaties, un|der the former, and that under the pre&s;ent government, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">milar.</P>
<P>But though &s;imilar, that under the pre&s;ent government is more comprehen&s;ive; for it is dive&s;ted of the re&s;triction in the provi&s;ion cited above, and is fortified by the expre&s;s declaration, that its acts &s;hall be valid notwith&s;tanding the con&s;titution or
<PB N="270" REF="028389_0846_0FD8EFB854A0E628">laws of any &s;tate.&mdash;This is evidence, (as was the fact) of a di&s;po&s;ition in the convention to di&s;embarra&s;s and reinforce the power of treaty. It ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed, that an Im|portant argument re&s;ults from the <HI>provi&s;o,</HI> which accompanies the power granted by the confederation, as to the natural ex|tent of this power. The declaration that no treaty of commerce &s;hall be made re&s;training the legi&s;lative power of a &s;tate from impo&s;ing &s;uch duties and impo&s;ts on foreigners as their own people are &s;ubject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any &s;pecies of commodities what&s;oever is an admi&s;&s;ion,

</LIST></P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid, that the provi&s;o, by implication, granted the power to make treaties of commerce, under which con|gre&s;s afterwards acted; for be&s;ides that this is incon&s;i&s;tent with the more obvious meaning of the clau&s;e, the fir&s;t article of the confederation leaves to the &s;tates individually every power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> delegated to the United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> The power of congre&s;s, therefore, to make a treaty of com|merce and every other treaty they did make&mdash;mu&s;t be vindicate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the ground that the expre&s;s grant of power to enter into treaties and alliances is a general, which nece&s;&s;arily included as <HI>particulars</HI> the various treaties they have made, and the vari|ous &s;tipulations of tho&s;e treaties.</P>
<P>Under this power, thus granted and defined, the alliance with France was contracted: guaranteeing, in the ca&s;e of a defen&s;ive war, her We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and when the <HI>ca&s;us foederis</HI> occurs, obliging the United States to make war for the defence of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently, to incur the ex|pen&s;es of war.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame power, treaties of commerce were made with France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Pru&s;&s;ia&mdash;Be&s;ides that every treaty of commerce is nece&s;&s;arily a <HI>regulation</HI> of com|merce between the parties, it has been &s;hown in the antecedent compari&s;on of tho&s;e treaties,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Articles 2d, 3d, and 4th of treaty with France, 2d, 3d, and 20th of treaty with Ru&s;&s;ia, 2d, and 3d of treaty with Holland, 3d and 4th of treaty with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">edon.</NOTE> with that lately negociated, that they produce the &s;pecific effects of re&s;training the legi&s;lative power from impo&s;ing higher or other duties on the articles of tho&s;e nations than on the like articles of other nations, and

<P>The&s;e treaties likewi&s;e define and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame ca&s;e of piracy, which is defined in the treaty with Great Britain. More|over, the treaty with France, as has been el&s;ewhere &s;hown, with regard to the rights of property <HI>naturalizes the whole French nation.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;ular convention with France, negociated, likewi&s;e, under the &s;ame power, grants to the con&s;uls of that country, various authorities and juri&s;dictions, &s;ome of a <HI>judicial nature,</HI> which are actual transfers to them of portions of the internal juri&s;diction and ordinary judiciary power of the country; the exerci&s;e of which our government is bound to aid with its whole &s;trength. It al&s;o grants exemptions to French con&s;uls from certain kinds of taxes, and to them, and French citizens, from all per&s;onal &s;ervice; all which are extremely delicate interfer|ences with our internal policy and ordinary juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame power, the treaty with Morocco was formed, which, be&s;ides various other regulations relative to war, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ral relative to trade, contains the rule, that neither party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> make war without a previous demand of reparation; in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">raint of the general di&s;cretionary power of congre&s;s to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> war.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame power, the treaty of peace with Great Bri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was made&mdash;This treaty contains the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a boundary line between the parties, which, in part, is arbitrary, and could not have been predicated upon preci&s;e antecedent right. It al&s;o prohibits the future confi&s;cation of the property of adherents to Great Britain: declares that no per&s;on &s;hall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of the part he took in the war, &s;uffer any future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or damage in his per&s;on, liberty, or property, and provides for the relea&s;e of &s;uch per&s;ons from confinement, and the di&s;|continuance of pro&s;ecutions again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive a higher act of controul, both of the legi&s;lative and judiciary authority, than by this article. The&s;e provi&s;ions are analagous in principle, to tho&s;e &s;tipulations which, in the &s;econd and ninth articles of the treaty under ex|amination, have given occa&s;ion to con&s;titutional objection.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame power, various treaties with Indians, inha|biting the territory of the United States, have been made; e&s;ta|bli&s;hing arbitrary lines of boundary with them: which determine the right of &s;oil on the one &s;ide and on the other. Some of tho&s;e treaties proceed on the principle of the United States
<PB N="272" REF="028389_0848_0FD8EFBF8A881B20">having conquered the Indian country, and profe&s;s to make gra|tuitous conce&s;&s;ions to them of the lands which are left to their occupation. There is al&s;o a feature of importance common to the&s;e treaties, which is the withdrawing of the protection of the United States from tho&s;e of their citizens, who intrude on Indian laws, leaving them to be puni&s;hed at the plea&s;ure of the Indians.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that, except as to the &s;tipulations for ap|pointing commi&s;&s;ioners, the treaties made under the confede|ration, contain all the features, identically or by analogy, which create con&s;titutional objections to the treaty before us: They re&s;train, in certain in&s;tances, the legi&s;lative power to lay taxes; they make numerous and important regulations of trade; they confer the benefit of naturalization as to property; they define ca&s;es of piracy; they create cau&s;es of expenditure; they direct and modify the power of war; they erect, <HI>within the country,</HI> tribunals unknown to our con&s;titutions and laws, in ca&s;es to which the&s;e are competent&mdash;whereas the treaty with Great Britain only provides for the appointment of <HI>arbitrators</HI> in ca&s;es to which our tribunals and laws are incompetent; and they make di&s;po&s;itions concerning the territory and property of the United States.</P>
<P>It is true, that &s;ome of the treaties made under the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> government, though &s;ub&s;equent to the propo&s;ing of the arti|cles of confederation to the &s;tates, were prior to the final a|doption of the&s;e articles; but &s;till it is pre&s;umable that the treaties were negociated with an eye to the powers of the <HI>pending</HI> national compact. Tho&s;e with Great Britain, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Morocco, and the convention with France, were po&s;terior to the completion of that compact.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be argued, that a more exten&s;ive con&s;truc|tion of the power of treaty, in the confederation, than in one pre&s;ent con&s;titution, was countenanced by the union in the &s;ame body of legi&s;lative powers with the power of treaty. But this argument can have no force, when it is con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that the principal legi&s;lative powers with regard to the objects embraced by the treaties of congre&s;s, were not ve&s;ted in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> body, but remained with the individual &s;tates&mdash;Such are the power of <HI>&s;pecific</HI> taxation, the power of regulating trade, the power of naturalization, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If in theory the objects of legi&s;lative power are excepted out of the power of treaty, this mu&s;t have been equally, at lea&s;t, the ca&s;e with the legi&s;lative powers of the &s;tate gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ments as with tho&s;e of the United States&mdash;Indeed the argu|ment was much &s;tronger for the objection, where di&s;tinct go|vernments
<PB N="273" REF="028389_0849_0FD8EFC154D38330">were the depo&s;itory of the legi&s;lative power, than where the &s;ame government was the depo&s;itory of that power and of the power of treaty.&mdash;Nothing but the intri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> force of the power of treaty could have enabled it to penetrate the &s;eparate &s;pheres of the &s;tate governments. The practice un|der the confederation for &s;o many years, acquie&s;ced in by all the &s;tates, is, therefore, a conclu&s;ive illu&s;tration of the power of treaty, and an irre&s;i&s;tible refutation of the novel and pre|po&s;terous doctrine, which impeaches the con&s;titutionality of that lately negociated&mdash;If the natural import of the terms u&s;ed in the con&s;titution were le&s;s clear and deci&s;ive than they are, that practice is a commentary upon them, and fixes their &s;en&s;e. For the &s;en&s;e in which certain terms were practi&s;ed up|on in a prior con&s;titution of government, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to have been intended, in u&s;ing the like terms in a &s;ub&s;equent con&s;titution of government for the &s;ame nation.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the practice under the pre&s;ent government be|fore the late treaty, has corre&s;ponded with that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Our treaties with &s;everal Indian nations regulate and change the boundaries between them and the United States&mdash;And in addition to compen&s;ations in gro&s;s, they &s;tipulate the payment of certain &s;pecific and perpetual annuities. Thus a treaty in Augu&s;t, 1790, with the Creeks (article 5) promi&s;es them the pearly &s;um of one thou&s;and five hundred dollars&mdash;And &s;imi|lar features are found in &s;ub&s;equent treaties with the Six Na|tions, the Cherokees, and the North We&s;tern Indians&mdash;This la&s;t has <HI>ju&s;t</HI> been ratified by the <HI>unanimous voice</HI> of the &s;enate. It &s;tipulates an annuity of 9500 dollars&mdash;and relinqui&s;hes to the Indians, a large tract of land which they had, by pre|ceding treaties, ceded to the United States.</P>
<P>Hence we find that our former treaties under the pre&s;ent government, as well as one &s;ub&s;equent to that under con&s;ide|ration, contradict the doctrine &s;et up again&s;t its con&s;titutional|ity&mdash;in the important particulars of making di&s;po&s;itions con|cerning the territory and property of the United States, and binding them to rai&s;e and pay money. The&s;e treaties have not only been made by the pre&s;ident, and ratified by the &s;enate, without any impeachment of their con&s;titutionality, but the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives has heretofore concurred, and with|out objection, in carrying them into effect, by the requi&s;ite appropriation of money.</P>
<P>The con&s;ular convention with France &s;tands in a peculiar predicament. It was negociated under the former government, and ratified under the pre&s;ent; and &s;o may be regarded as a treaty of both governments, illu&s;trative of the extent of the power of treaty in both. The delicate and even the extraordi|nary
<PB N="274" REF="028389_0850_0FD8EFC62F6A4A58">nature of the provi&s;ions it contains, have been adverted to. Though all reflecting men have thought ill of the proprie|ty of &s;ome of them, as inconveniently breaking in upon our interior admini&s;tration, legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary; only acquie&s;cing in them from the difficulty of getting rid of &s;tipulations entered into by our public agents under competent powers, yet no que&s;tion has been heard about their con&s;tituti|onality. And congre&s;s have, by law, a&s;&s;i&s;ted their execution by making our judicial tribunals, and the public force of the coun|try, auxiliary to the decrees of the foreign tribunals which they authorize within our territory.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that our con&s;titution, by making all former treaties and engagements as obligatory upon the United States, under that con&s;titution, as they were under the confe|deration, rendered the ratification of the convention a matter of nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;the an&s;wer is, that either the engagements, which it contracted, were already conclu&s;ive, or they were not&mdash;if the former, there was no need of a ratification; if the latter, there was no ab&s;olute obligation to it. And, in every &s;uppo&s;ition, a ratification, by the pre&s;ident, with the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, could have been predicated only upon the power given in the pre&s;ent con&s;titution in relation to treaties; and to have any va|lidity, mu&s;t have been within the limit of that power.</P>
<P>But it has been heretofore &s;een that the inference from this in&s;trument is no le&s;s &s;trong, if referred to the power under the confederation, than if referred to the power under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution.</P>
<P>How happens it, that all the&s;e inva&s;ions of the con&s;titution, if they were &s;uch, were never di&s;covered, and that all the de|partments of the government, and all parties in the public councils &s;hould have co-operated in giving them a &s;anction? Does it not prove that all were convinced, that the power of treaty, applied in our exterior relations to objects, which, in the ordinary cour&s;e of internal admini&s;tration and in reference to our&s;elves, were of the cognizance of the legi&s;lative power? and particularly that the former was competent to bind the lat|ter in the delicate points of rai&s;ing and appropriating money? If competent to this, what legi&s;lative power can be more &s;acred, more out of its reach?</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k (and a very &s;olemn que&s;tion it is, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who are bound by oath to &s;upport the con&s;titution) Has it not been demon&s;trated that the provi&s;ions in the treaty are ju&s;tified by the true and manife&s;t interpretation of the con|&s;titution&mdash;are &s;anctioned by the practice upon a &s;imilar power under the confederation, and by the practice in other in&s;tances under the pre&s;ent government?</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="028389_0851_0FD8EFCA0F3F32C0">

<P>THE treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, lately concluded in London between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay, on the part of the king of Great Britain and the United States, re&s;pectively, is one of the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects ever agitated in America &s;ince &s;he became an independent nation; it &s;eems, indeed, to have engro&s;&s;ed the public mind more than any other, the adoption of the federal con&s;titution, only ex|cepted.&mdash;Rea&s;on, prejudice, and pa&s;&s;ion, equally prompt to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it, and every individual enli&s;ts him&s;elf u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the banners of one or the other. This renders a temperate en|quiry into its merits, without regard, either to the original framers, or its &s;ub&s;equent advocates or enemies, an object of the fir&s;t importance. I &s;hall, therefore, leave it to others to di&s;|cu&s;s, whether the late envoy extraordinary entered upon, and concluded it, in pur&s;uance of <HI>general</HI> or <HI>particular</HI> in&s;tructions, either from the pre&s;ident of the United States <HI>alone,</HI> or <HI>by</HI> and <HI>with</HI> the <HI>advice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of <HI>the &s;enate;</HI> or whether, he pur|&s;ued the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tates of <HI>his own better judgment,</HI> without any autho|rity what&s;oever. If, however, there &s;hould appear any thing in the treaty to condenm, <HI>decen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed precedent,</HI> will re|quire, that it &s;hould be con&s;idered as the <HI>act of the mini&s;ter, only;</HI> more e&s;pecially as the &s;anction of the &s;upreme executive magi&s;|trate of the United States has been hitherto with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, as we have every rea&s;on to believe.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="028389_0853_0FD8EFCEAF3D8950">
But, before entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the articles of the treaty, it may not be improper to advert, not only to exi&s;ting circum&s;tances at the time it was concluded, but to &s;ome ante|cedent events, which may be pre&s;umed to have had &s;ome ope|ration upon the minds of the nations, who&s;e mutual friend&s;hip is, by this in&s;trument, propo&s;ed to be conciliated, and perpe|tually cemented. For a treaty (&s;o far as relates to a free republic at lea&s;t) ought to be con&s;idered as the act of the nation, and not merely of the government, only; or, in other words, of the parties who conclude, &s;ign, and ratify them. To this end, due attention &s;hould be paid to the prevailing &s;entiment of the na|tion, &s;o as to remove every ob&s;tacle to that cordiality, and un|feigned friend&s;hip, which treaties of amity are intended to pro|mote.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t twenty years &s;ince the United States of America, &s;timulated by the tyrannical u&s;urpations of the pre&s;ent king of Great Britian, declared the good people of the&s;e &s;tates ab&s;olved from their allegiance to that prince, and that all political con|nexion with Great Britain ought to be totally di&s;&s;olved. A cruel civil war was waged again&s;t them during a period of eight years, the calamities of which were heightened by every wanton act of depredation, oppre&s;&s;ion, and in&s;ult, that rapa|city, cruelty, and a vindictive &s;pirit could prompt men to com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. Our &s;laves were excited to rebel again&s;t us; the &s;avages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our frontiers were ba&s;ely &s;timulated to add, to the &s;angui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h enemy, their own more inhuman mode of warfare. Our towns were wantonly con&s;umed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, and our country every where laid wa&s;te. Our property was &s;eized for the u&s;e of the armies of our enemies; or de|&s;troyed, without compen&s;ation, and without compunction or re&s;traint: Thou&s;ands of our negroes, the cultivators of the &s;oil in the &s;outhern &s;tates (and forming the greater part of the moveable property of their ma&s;ters) were enticed or forced away from their &s;ervice&mdash;Eighty thou&s;and of our fellow citizens are &s;uppo&s;ed to have fallen victims to the offended maje&s;ty of that vindictive monarch, who&s;e name was more execrated among us, than ever Nero's was at Rome. Inability to pro&s;ecute the war longer, produced a peace; but it was peace without for|givene&s;s, without friend&s;hip, and without &s;incerity. During the long cour&s;e of ho&s;tilities, every &s;entiment of regard and of mutual confidence had been extingui&s;hed on the part of both nations, and the peace concluted between them, was rather calculated to perpetuate, than to extinguith the remembrance of their mutual ani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ity. The citizens of the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates complained that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ticular intere&s;ts had
<PB N="278" REF="028389_0854_0FD8EFD01C3121F0">been overlooked, or &s;acrificed, by &s;ome of the articles of the treaty. The northern &s;tates found their trade abridged, by the very in&s;trument which they &s;uppo&s;ed would have &s;ecured its unlimited exten&s;ion. Thus even the treaty of peace had no other recommendation, in the eyes of the people of America, than the termination of ho&s;tility. His Britannic maje&s;ty, on the ether hand, appears not to have entered into it with good faith. The we&s;tern po&s;ts, which were to have been delivered up "with all convenient &s;peed," were forcibly detained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his troops; and the negroes and other property taken from the people of America, were, in direct violation of the treaty, carried away without compen&s;ation. An equal di&s;po&s;ition to evade, or violate &s;ome of the articles of the treaty was attri|buted to &s;everal of the &s;tates, and mutual complaints and recri|minations took place between the two nations. The re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon our We&s;t India commerce by his Britannic ma|je&s;ty; his <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> ill offices towards us, in exciting the depre|dations of the Barbary &s;tates upon our commerce; and in fo|menting di&s;contents among the Indian nations, and even &s;timu|lating and aiding them in acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t us, occa&s;ioned tho&s;e wounds to inflame and fe&s;ter anew, which had been, at be&s;t, imperfectly cicatri&s;ed.</P>
<P>The aver&s;ion of his Britannic maje&s;ty to enter into any com|mercial treaty with the United States, had manife&s;ted it&s;elf, in the rejection of all overtures made for that purpo&s;e by the pre&s;ent vice-pre&s;ident of the United States, who was &s;ent thi|ther to effect &s;uch a negoci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> long after the conclu&s;ion of the peace.&mdash;The adoption of the federal con&s;titution re|moved all tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, which, it was pretended, prevented the court of Great Britain from entering into negociations with us. It did more.&mdash;It removed every barrier to the full and complete execution of the treaty of peace, on the part of the United States, by rendering that treaty a part of the &s;upre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> law of the land: the federal courts, in their deci&s;ions, mani|fe&s;ted the mo&s;t unequivocal di&s;po&s;ition to give to the treaty the mo&s;t <HI>favorable</HI> con&s;truction on behalf of Briti&s;h creditors.&mdash;It was the expectation of all, that the energy of the federal go|vernment would not fall to extort from his Britannic maje&s;ty an equal compliance with the treaty on his part.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, at the time of its adoption, was regarded as the guarantee of a free trade with the We&s;t Indies, and with every other part of the world; it &s;oon became matter of wonder and of dina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">action, that it had not produced the&s;e effects. It was finally made known that the executive of the United States had taken mea&s;ures to di&s;cover the &s;entiments of
<PB N="279" REF="028389_0855_0FD8EFD24710EDF0">the Briti&s;h court on the &s;ubject of a treaty of commerce, and that the propo&s;ition &s;till continued to be treated with di&s;re&s;pect. &mdash;In the mean time, France was engaged in a revolution, the principles of which were &s;uppo&s;ed to bear &s;o great an analogy to our own, that every American felt him&s;elf intere&s;ted in her &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Our prayers were continually offered up in her be|half, and it was concluded that the cords of amity would be drawn as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible between the two republics.&mdash;His Britannic maje&s;ty was not long in joining the alliance formed among the enemies of the new republic. America &s;oon found her&s;elf made a party in the war, <HI>by her &s;ufferings:</HI> the &s;poliati|ons on our commerce are well known; they have been felt through every part of the United States. Not only our ve&s;&s;els with their cargoes were &s;eized and confi&s;cated, becau&s;e engaged in commerce with the enemies of his Britannic maje&s;ty; but our citizens were abu&s;ed in their per&s;ons, impri&s;oned or im|pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of a &s;overeign whom they dete&s;ted, un|der pretext that they were his &s;ubjects. Innumerable acts of piracy were committed by a &s;warm of privateers which infe&s;t|ed our coa&s;ts; nor was the in&s;olence practi&s;ed by his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;ea officers inferior to the depredations of the priva|teers. Stimulated by re&s;entment, and a de&s;ire of retaliation, &s;ome of the citizens of America took commi&s;&s;ions from, or entered into the &s;ervice of, their &s;i&s;ter republic. They were pro&s;ecuted for exerci&s;ing a natural right, not repugnant to any treaty, or known law of the land. The&s;e pro&s;ecutions were, by the &s;ufferers and their friends, con&s;idered as an act of &s;uper|errogation in our government, founded on a partiality to Briti&s;h intere&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to that of France. Every act of conce&s;|&s;ion or conciliation on the part of the United States, &s;eemed to give new life and vigour to the arrogance, in&s;olence, and depredations of the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war and crui&s;ers. The Indians, who&s;e ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition towards us was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of Briti&s;h perfidy, pro&s;ecuted the war again&s;t us in a &s;tile altogether new, and gave rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that they were not only aided with arms, ammunition, and warlike &s;tores, by the Briti&s;h government, but that they were actually a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the officers and militia, if not by the regular troops of that nation. CONGRESS, to whom it belongs to decide upon a <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;e of war,</HI> and to <HI>regulate commerce,</HI> rou&s;ed by &s;o many re|iterated acts of aggre&s;&s;ion, had re&s;olved upon &s;ome cautionary mea&s;ures to &s;ecure indemnification for injury, and to retaliate upon a nation from whom &s;o many vexations were daily receiv|ed. The repre&s;entatives of the people concurred in the mea|&s;ures propo&s;ed, by a great majority&mdash;the &s;enate were divided&mdash;
<PB N="280" REF="028389_0856_0FD8EFD30B15BCF0">the vice-pre&s;ident held <HI>the balance</HI> in his hand, and the &s;cale preponderated again&s;t the repre&s;entatives of the people. At this moment of efferve&s;cence in the public mind, the late en|voy extraordinary was appointed; the object of his mi&s;&s;ion was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a demand of reparation of injuries, and a com|pliance with the terms of the violated treaty of peace.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort recapitulation of preceding events, it will appear, that the public mind was by no means prepared to en|ter, with cordiality, into a &s;tate of amity with a nation who&s;e government had, for twenty years, ince&s;&s;antly per&s;ecuted the United States, either by open acts of ho&s;tility, or the in&s;idi|ous arts of &s;ecret animo&s;ity. It was, therefore, rea&s;onably ex|pected, that a treaty, who&s;e object was to bind the two nati|ons in amity with each other, would contain within it every thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;often a&s;perity&mdash;to &s;ubdue re&s;entment&mdash;to &s;atisfy claims, and to conciliate affection. To determine how far this expectation has been fulfilled by the pre&s;ent treaty, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, not only to &s;tate what it <HI>contains,</HI> but al&s;o, what it does <HI>not contain.</HI> I &s;hall begin with the former; and, in order to do it with the more regularity, I &s;hall take it article by article.</P>
<P>The preamble &s;tates the motives to the treaty to be, the de|fire "of terminating the differences between his Britan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> maje&s;ty and the United States, in &s;uch a manner, as, <HI>with out reference to the merits of their re&s;pective complaints and pre|ten&s;ions,</HI> may be be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under-&s;tanding." Such a preamble would either lead us to expect the mo&s;t <HI>liberal conce&s;&s;ions</HI> in favor of the United States, or a <HI>total dereliction</HI> of their complaints by the envoy extraordinary. On the part of his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;uch a waver might be con&s;idered, if not a mark of great magnani|mity, at lea&s;t, of great conde&s;cen&s;ion, whil&s;t his &s;hips of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and privateers were in the full career of plunder on the com|merce of our unre&s;i&s;ting citizens. Nor can it be altogether denied, that his maje&s;ty, as well as the United States, had &s;ome cau&s;e to murmur at the events of his reign:&mdash;He had lo&s;t an immen&s;e territory, which he had regarded as his here|ditary right, <HI>jure divino,</HI> and had &s;pent above an hundred mil|lions &s;terling of his &s;ubjects' money in the attempt to retain it in &s;ubjection to him. He might be compared to an unlucky &s;port&s;man who&s;e over-charged gun had bur&s;ted, burnt his &s;in|gers, given him a &s;ound dou&s;e in the chaps, and knock'd out half a dozen of his teeth, in attempting to &s;hoot a partridge: &mdash;and America to the poor bird it&s;elf, which had got a griev|ous wound, in &s;pite of the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the aukward
<PB N="281" REF="028389_0857_0FD8EFD81DF7F770">mark&s;man. Con&s;idering, however, the pre&s;umable object of the mi&s;&s;ion of the envoy extraordinary, it appears &s;omewhat unaccountable upon what grounds he could-&s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf authorized to relinqui&s;h the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the complaints of the United States, unle&s;s indeed he apprehended that his Britan|nic maje&s;ty's choler might be &s;o far rou&s;ed by it, as again to reject a negociation, and compel him to return to America <HI>re infecta:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whil&s;t the treaty was in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion before the &s;enate, a certain gentleman, high in office, who was once amba&s;&s;ador at the Briti&s;h co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rd to de|clare, that <HI>be</HI> could have procered a <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter</HI> treaty, but de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">d doing &s;o becau&s;e he thought it not &s;ufficiently advantage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to America.</NOTE> or, perhaps, he was &s;en&s;ible, that in the adju&s;t|ment of &s;uch a <HI>variety of claims as America was entitled to in|&s;i&s;t on,</HI> the bu&s;ine&s;s might be &s;o far procra&s;tinated as to le&s;&s;en the glory of the achievement; or, perhaps, <HI>retard</HI> his return to his nauve country, in time to accept that <HI>accumulation of ho|nor</HI> which there awaited him. But let us now proceed to exa|mine the treaty, &s;ome of the articles of which I &s;hall pa&s;s over without ob&s;ervation, as being either of little moment, or cu&s;tomary in &s;imilar treaties; whil&s;t upon &s;ome others I may wi&s;h to detain the reader's attention.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of eight and twenty articles which the treaty contains, the fir&s;t ten are declared to be <HI>permanent;</HI> the remainder are of limited duration. The fir&s;t &s;tipulates, in the ordinary form, that there &s;hall be peace, "and true and &s;incere friend&s;hip be|tween his Britannic maje&s;ty and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the United States, and between the people, re&s;pectively, without excepti|on of per&s;ons or places."&mdash;To render this article effectual, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ub&s;equent articles &s;hould contain <HI>all &s;uch things</HI> as "are calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding between the nations:" otherwi&s;e, this article will ever remain in the &s;ame &s;tate of <HI>inexecution,</HI> as tho&s;e relating to the <HI>negroes</HI> and the <HI>we&s;tern po&s;ts,</HI> in the treaty of peace.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd article &s;tipulates that his Britannic maje&s;ty <HI>will</HI> withdraw all his troops and garri&s;ons from all po&s;ts and places within the United States, on or before the fir&s;t day of June, 1796. This, by the treaty of peace, ought to have been done, <HI>at lea&s;t, a dozen years ago;</HI> and it appears &s;omewhat &s;trange that the immediate performance of it was not made a condition, precedent to any further negociation, except for reparation for the &s;poliations on our commerce, &amp;c. for how can we be a&s;&s;ured that his Britannic maje&s;te <HI>will</HI> ob&s;erve more good faith in the performance of this treaty, than the former, if an excu&s;e can be found to evade it? The only difference
<PB N="282" REF="028389_0858_0FD8EFD9212296F8">that this part of the &s;econd article makes between our pre&s;ent and former &s;ituation is, that the detention of the po&s;ts, <HI>hitherts</HI> is evidently <HI>&s;anctioned</HI> by the pre&s;ent treaty; and all <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> for former breaches of faith, and aggre&s;&s;ions in this re&s;pect, mo&s;t <HI>generou&s;ly waved,</HI> on the part of the United States; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that this article furni&s;hes an interpre|tation of the words "<HI>with all convenient &s;peed,</HI>" in the former treaty; which, in all future negociations, with his Britannic maje&s;ty, may be under&s;tood to mean <HI>a dozen years.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame article provides that the &s;ettlers and traders, with|in the precincts or juri&s;diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, may <HI>con|tinue to re&s;ide there, without being compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oaths of allegiance to the govern|ment thereofs,</HI> or remove and di&s;po&s;e of their lands and other property, at their election. This, as it re&s;pects traders, and other <HI>tran&s;ient</HI> per&s;ons, is ju&s;t and proper: as it relates to <HI>land|holders</HI> it will be made the &s;ubject of future remark, when we examine the ninth article.</P>

Hence it &s;eems probable that Great Britain will continue to monopolize the trade on the lakes, and finally, the whole trade of the American north we&s;tern territory. Other cau&s;es than tho&s;e already mentioned will contribute to promote this. <HI>Briti&s;h traders</HI> are already &s;ettled at the <HI>mo&s;t advantageous &s;tations</HI> for carrying on commerce, and probably have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of <HI>all the land</HI> at tho&s;e places, which the preceding article &s;ecures to them <HI>for ever.</HI> An American going there to &s;ettle would find him&s;elf under all the di&s;advantages of attempt|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in a foreign country, and expo&s;ed to all the ill offices which jealou&s;y could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here enquire how far the United States had a right to in&s;i&s;t on the free navigation of the river St. Lawrence, at lea&s;t for their ve&s;&s;els bound from one part of the United States to another, re&s;erving that que&s;tion for another place; but it is ob&s;ervable, that while our ve&s;&s;els are totally excluded from the Atlantic ports of Canada, &amp;c. the ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e countries may freely navigate our rivers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The writer, for want of a correct map, and de&s;cription of tho&s;e parts of the United States is unable to de&s;cend to &s;uch particulars as would illu&s;trate this part of his &s;ubject.</NOTE> as far as the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign &s;hips, in any part of the United States. This want of reciprocity will be excu&s;ed by the advosates for the treaty, by a general reference to colonial laws; to which I &s;hall offer an an&s;wer in its proper place.</P>
<P>Commercial regulations, not founded in experience, can never be adopted with too much caution. They ought never to find a place in a perpetual treaty; for whatever inconvenience or di&s;advantage re&s;ult from them, it cannot be removed with|out hazarding a war; &s;ince it can never be expected that a com|merical nation, tenacious of her intere&s;ts, will ever re&s;ign an ad|vantage that is once &s;ecured by a perpetual treaty.

According to the principles laid down in Calvin's ca&s;e [Co. rep. part 7.] when two countries, which have been under alle|giance to the &s;ame prince, &s;eparate, all tho&s;e of either country <HI>born before the &s;eparation</HI> takes place, may hold, or inhetic lands in that country from which they are thus &s;eparated.

For it was held, that the common law, which excludes aliens from inheriting, was not altered, or intended to be altered, by that article. And the rea&s;ons for that opinion were not without weight in the minds of tho&s;e who maintained them; &s;ince they conceived that the principle of excluding aliens from holding lands was founded in found policy; adopting herein one of the rea&s;ons of the common law of England, <HI>"that the nation might in time be &s;ubject to foreign influence."</HI>&mdash;In giving the mo&s;t liberal con|&s;truction to the treaty of peace, they did not apprehend it was meant to contravene a principle &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;hed among their ance&s;tors, and &s;o generally under&s;tood.

His zeal for negociation &s;eems to have made him lo&s;e &s;ight of every other object: and no doubt, from the expedition, with which this important treaty was concluded, every ob&s;tacle, which might for a moment retard its completion, was in&s;tantly waved on the &s;ide of the American negociator.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s extraordinary is the &s;tipulation contained in the &s;ucceeding clau&s;e of the &s;ame article, which declares, that during the continuance thereof, the United States will pro|hibit and re&s;train the carrying <HI>any mela&s;&s;es, coffee, cocoa,</HI> or <HI>cot|ton,</HI> in American ve&s;&s;els, either from the <HI>&s;ugar i&s;lands,</HI> or the <HI>United States,</HI> to any part of the world, except the United States. Never was a more humiliating conce&s;&s;ion propo&s;ed or acceded to, in a commercial treaty. The interdiction extends not only to the produce of the Engli&s;h &s;ugar i&s;lands, but to &s;imilar productions from any other part of the globe. This was a decided &s;troke at the commerce between America and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of every other nation in the We&s;t Indies, whether French, Dutch, Spani&s;h, Dani&s;h, or Swedi&s;h! Britain &s;up|po&s;ing the produce of her i&s;lands &s;ufficient for the con&s;umpti|on of the United States, or rather, determining, if po&s;&s;ible, to limit their con&s;umption to what her i&s;lands can &s;upply, thus &s;ecures a monopoly by interdicting the exportation of any &s;urplus of their productions, or &s;imilar productions of other countries; and moreover, lays a foundation for the right of <HI>&s;earching</HI> all our ve&s;&s;els, and, upon the &s;lighte&s;t pretext, de|taining or carrying them into her own ports for <HI>adjudication,</HI> if it &s;hould appear that they have on board any of the&s;e arti|cles <HI>beyond rea&s;onable &s;ea-&s;tores.</HI> Surely by &s;ome &s;trange effect of magic, the envoy extraordinary had lo&s;t ali memory of events &s;ub&s;equent to the year 1763, and conceived him&s;elf bound to receive as law, whatever the Briti&s;h &s;ecretary of &s;tate was plea&s;ed to dictate to him! Or was this conce&s;&s;ion the re|&s;ult of his fears for the fate of the French colonies, that they would either be de&s;olated, or become an appendage to Great Britain? Or did he conceive that &s;uch a <HI>re&s;tricted</HI> commerce as he has &s;tipulated for with the Briti&s;h colonies, <HI>clogged with re&s;trictions upon our commerce with all other parts of the globe,</HI> was more valuable than all our We&s;t India trade put together?

XVIII.

I have before noticed the probable effect of this &s;tipulation; it may prevent &s;ome <HI>few enormous injuries,</HI> but will not in the lea&s;t check le&s;&s;er abu&s;es.

What &s;atisfaction can be obtained in &s;uch a ca&s;e? Shall the ma&s;ter of the merchant &s;hip alter his voyage, and go to the port to which the privateer belongs, to obtain reparation? The idea is ab&s;urd. He mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the ill treatment he has received, and con&s;ider his deliverance from the hands of &s;uch ruffians, as ample recompence for his &s;ufferings.

<P>A variety of other ob&s;ervations, equally important, might, no doubt, have &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves to a per&s;on who had full lei&s;ure to examine this &s;ubject, and may be met with in the &s;everal publications that have already appeared. Without pre|tending to abilities exten&s;ive enough to embrace the whole, I &s;hall now ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am well aware that it will be contended by the advocates for the treaty, that a refu&s;al to ratify it will bring on a war; or mu&s;t continue matters between us and Great Britain, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of unredre&s;&s;ed wrongs, and a pa&s;&s;ive acquie&s;cence therein. I &s;hall add a few words by way of an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the danger of producing a war. 1&s;t, The refu&s;al <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enter into a &s;tate of amity, or &s;trict commercial connexion, or to form a treaty on any &s;ubject, with a nation with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are at peace, unle&s;s &s;uch refu&s;al &s;hould amount to a denial of ju&s;t compen&s;ation for injuries complained of, is no cau&s;e of war between nations. Whenever Great Britain may choo&s;e to commence a war with the United States, &s;he will not want a pretext. At pre&s;ent the treaty it&s;elf is the mo&s;t unequivocal proof, that &s;he hath &s;carcely the &s;hadow of complaint; for the ca&s;es to which the &s;ixth article can extend, even with all the latitude which the liberality of the envoy extraordinary hath given it, are not attributable to the want either of national faith or ju&s;tice, but to the operation of tho&s;e means of &s;elf-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;ence which the law of nations permits, or of general laws, founded on the emergencies of the times. The detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, alone, would more than balance the ac|count, in a &s;ingle year, if &s;tated according to the principles of ju&s;tice. As to the captures made within the juri&s;diction of the United States, or by ve&s;&s;els armed therein, Mr. Jeffer&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> letter &s;hows the readine&s;s of our government to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|cau&s;e of complaint, on that head. 2d, Great Britain derives &s;uch immen&s;e advantages from her commerce with America, that nothing &s;hort of a &s;tate of lunacy could prompt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|terrupt it, for the &s;ake of reparation on either of the before mentioned accounts. 3d, The immen&s;e property which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> merchants, her monied men, and even her <HI>&s;overeign</HI> holds in the funds and banks of the United States, or have due to them from individuals, is, <HI>until the pre&s;ent treaty &s;hall be ratified,</HI> a further &s;ecurity again&s;t tho&s;e ho&s;tile aggre&s;&s;ions, to which the
<PB N="309" REF="028389_0885_0FD8BF2E62D680B8">fear of &s;eque&s;tration, or confi&s;cation, gave &s;o &s;udden and un|expected a check. 4th, She has her hands &s;o full already, that, much addicted as &s;he is to ho&s;tility, &s;he will, probably, for the pre&s;ent, avoid increa&s;ing the number of her enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the redre&s;s of wrongs. This is &s;o partial and inade|quate in the pre&s;ent treaty, that no great injury can accrue from delaying to accept it; nor does the treaty contain &s;uch &s;ecurity again&s;t the repetition of them, as &s;hould prompt us, on that ac|count, to accept of the partial compen&s;ation that it holds forth. Much le&s;s are the compen&s;ation and &s;ecurity provided by the treaty, &s;uch as ought to be accepted in lieu of <HI>tho&s;e claims</HI> which are pa&s;&s;ed over in <HI>&s;ilence.</HI> The &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, were it not by the terms of this treaty an object greatly dimi|ni&s;hed in its importance to the United States, is an event &s;till &s;o <HI>remote</HI> (not to add <HI>uncertain</HI>) as not to ju&s;tify the precipitate adoption of a mea&s;ure calculated to impair the value of the ac|qui&s;ition, or render it totally u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3d, The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the 12th article, by the advice of the &s;enate, having effectually retarded the final ratification of the treaty, the &s;ame train of negociation which mu&s;t be re&s;orted to, for the adju&s;tment of that article, &s;o as to be acceptable to the &s;enate, may doubtle&s;s be recurred to for <HI>adju&s;ting other ob|jectionable points.</HI></P>
<P>No inconvenience, therefore, can rea&s;onably be apprehended from the <HI>non-ratification</HI> of the treaty in its pre&s;ent form. Hav|ing been communicated to the people, the executive are now better able to form a judgment of the public mind, and to weigh objections which perhaps had not before occurred; and the people of the United States with confidence hope, that the <HI>pre&s;ident</HI> will not only attend to their rea&s;ons, but pay re&s;pect to the <HI>general will of that people,</HI> who&s;e affectionate confidence and authority he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es on the pre&s;ent momentous occa&s;ion. How far the&s;e remarks may accord with the <HI>general wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of the people, it remains for <HI>him</HI> to determine.</P>
<P>When the con&s;titution of the United States was adopted in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the convention, among the other amendments, pro|po&s;ed, "That no commercial treaty &s;hall be ratified without the concurrence of two-thirds of the whole number of the members of the &s;enate; and no treaty, <HI>ceding,</HI> contracting, or &s;u&s;pending the <HI>territorial rights</HI> or claims of the United States or any of them; or their or any of their rights or claims to &s;ithing in the American &s;eas, or <HI>navigating</HI> the <HI>American rivers,</HI> &s;hall be made, but in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t urgent and extreme nece&s;&s;i|ty; nor &s;hall any <HI>&s;uch treaty</HI> be <HI>ratified without the concurrence of

<P>Re&s;olved, That in the late negociation with Great Britain, its primary object, the pre&s;ervation of peace, has been com|pletely

<P>I HAVE received your letter of the 29th ult. covering re&s;olutions of a meeting of the inhabitants of the county of We&s;tmoreland relative to the treaty with Great Britain.</P>
<P>The approbation therein given of this mea&s;ure, and the a&s;|&s;urances of &s;upporting the con&s;tituted authorities of our coun|try, cannot but be plea&s;ing to all who know the value of regu|lar government.</P>
<P>No wi&s;h, while I fill the office I now have the honor to hold, can be more ardent, than that the acts of my admini|&s;tration &s;hould give &s;atisfaction to my con&s;tituents. The con|trary will always give me pain.
