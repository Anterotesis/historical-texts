<HEAD>American Independence.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by an elegant wri|ter, that <Q>as an individual unconnected with the government, can only rea&s;on upon their mea&s;ures from what is publickly known, &s;uch an one may po&s;&s;ibly contribute to weaken the effect of their authority by an attempt to &s;up|port it upon ground which they would di&s;|claim. A good cau&s;e is often injured by an un&s;kilful defence, and an un&s;ucce&s;sful effort always le&s;&s;ons the facility of a practicable ope|ration.</Q> With a conviction of the truth of the&s;e remarks &s;trong on my mind, it is not with|out con&s;iderable reluctance, that I undertake to &s;tate certain rea&s;ons and facts, to prove the po|licy and expediency of the late appointment of an emba&s;&s;y to France. But as the &s;ubject is before the public, and is intere&s;ting in an high degree to every American, what is now offered, cannot be deemed impertinent, and may be u&s;e|ful.</P>
<P>That any favourable opinion in the Pre&s;ident of the United States, re&s;pecting the French rev|olution, or the pre&s;ent government of France, dictated the nomination, no one in his &s;en&s;es can &s;uppo&s;e. His many invaluable writings, his &s;peeches to Congre&s;s, his an&s;wers to numerous addre&s;&s;es, all his mea&s;ures, and all his conduct, forbid the momentary admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an idea. That a man of his deep political knowledge,
<PB N="4" REF="035103_0005_1000A686024A2A98">proved devotion to his country, incorruptible integrity, decided aver&s;ion to innovation and all the wild doctrines of modern philo&s;ophy; of &s;o thorough a knowledge of the wickedne&s;s of the French rulers, could be taken in by any de|lu&s;ive appearances, could be lulled by any pro|fe&s;&s;ions of their &s;incerity, is not, humanly &s;peak|ing, within the line of po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>But a little experience of this world and its ways, is &s;ufficient to convince us, how &s;eldom the &s;till voice of rea&s;on is heeded in the heat of political di&s;&s;ention. The mo&s;t important &s;ervi|ces are forgotten, the mo&s;t exalted talents are depreciated, and one &s;ingle difference of opin|ion outweighs a life of virtue, patrioti&s;m and u&s;e fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections naturally ari&s;e out of the &s;ubject, but are not the defence on which I depend. It can I think be clearly &s;hewn, with|out any reference to the confidence due to the Pre&s;ident, and independent of all per&s;onal con|&s;iderations, that <HI>the mea&s;ure</HI> is entitled to our warme&s;t approbation, as calculated to counter|act the ho&s;tile de&s;igns of France, and promote the be&s;t intere&s;ts of the United States.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected, that the French would &s;et down ea&s;y and contented, under the di&s;appointment and di&s;grace which the failure and developement of their attempts on our in|dependence, peace and honour had brought up|on them. We had every thing to fear from their intrigue, the lu&s;t of power, mortified pride, and ungratified avarice.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;ion of Logan has cea&s;ed to agitate the public mind; but tho&s;e who think it too ri|diculous
<PB N="5" REF="035103_0006_1000A69EB2DBE5C0">to be worthy of notice, will &s;ome time or other be convinced of their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>That he was the agent of the French party in the United States, to the Directory, is beyond a doubt; and it is equally certain that the future operations of the Directory were determined by his communications.</P>
<P><HI>The plan,</HI> I think, will be clearly made to ap|pear by what is herein di&s;clo&s;ed; to be, <HI>For the Directory, previous to the adjournment of Congre&s;s, to reque&s;t a renewal of the negociation at Paris, and to give the a&s;&s;urances required by the Pre&s;ident, in rather an indirect manner, with the view that he &s;hould not con&s;ider them &s;atisfactory, and decline a|nother emba&s;&s;y. Then, immediately upon the di&s;&s;o|lution of Congre&s;s to &s;end an Envoy Extraordinary to Philadelphia, to tell the &s;tory of our Government's re|jecting the advances of France, and to &s;olicit a hear|ing on all &s;ubjects of di&s;pute.</HI></P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, how was this known at the time of the nomination? I an&s;wer&mdash;a much le&s;s degree of penetration than is attributed to the Executive of the United States, mu&s;t have fore&s;een that France would croud us with offers, a&s;&s;urances, and emba&s;&s;ies. How to meet the&s;e was then the que&s;tion. To refu&s;e to treat, and afterwards be forced into it, would have been a mo&s;t unfortunate circum&s;tance. It would have de&s;troyed the work of at lea&s;t ten years; it would have taken away the well earned pop|ularity of the American Government, and re|&s;tored French influence, with all its attendant horrors. Every body mu&s;t allow that <HI>for us, Paris is the be&s;t place to treat in.</HI> It may be urg|ed that as France had refufed to receive our
<PB N="6" REF="035103_0007_1000A68E4498ECF8">mini&s;ters, we could refu&s;e to receive her mini&s;|ter. But this is reckoning without the ho&s;t&mdash; We <HI>might</HI> have <HI>taken</HI> this ground but we never could have <HI>kept</HI> it. The rights of emba&s;&s;y are well under&s;tood, and France having di&s;regard|ed them, would be no apology for our doing the &s;ame. It is a <HI>general maxim</HI> of the law of nations, that, <Q>we are not to refu&s;e admitting and hearing even an enemy's mini&s;ter. The greater the calamities of war are, the more is it incumbent on nations to pre&s;erve means for putting an end to it.</Q></P>
<P>It may be in&s;i&s;ted on, that the pre&s;ent gov|ernment of France is an <HI>u&s;urpation.</HI> The fact is readily admitted; but it mu&s;t not be forgot|ten that the <HI>u&s;urpers</HI> have been long &s;ince ac|knowledged <HI>&s;overeigns</HI> by the United States, and by every nation that has had any thing to do with them. Every objection on this &s;core again&s;t the pre&s;ent emba&s;&s;y, applies with equal force, again&s;t Mr. Morris's continuing at Paris after the dethronement of the King, again&s;t the reception of Mr Genet, again&s;t the appointment of Mr. Monroe, again&s;t the reception of Me&s;&s;rs. Fauchet and Adet, and again&s;t the appointment of General Pinckney, and of the three Envoys Extraordinary, Me&s;&s;rs. Pinckney, Mar&s;hall and Gerry. But, &s;uch an objection has no validi|ty. On the que&s;tion, "Whether mini&s;ters may be received "from or &s;ent to an u&s;urper" VAT|TEL lays it down, that <Q>foreign powers, if the advantage of their affairs invites them to it, follow po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: there is no rule more cer|tain, or more agreeable to the law of nations, and the independency of them. As foreign|ers
<PB N="7" REF="035103_0008_1000A6E9B855F388">have no right to interfere in the dome&s;tic concerns of a people, they are not obliged to canvas and in&s;pect its oeconomy in tho&s;e particulars, or to weigh either the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of them. They may if they think proper, &s;uppo&s;e the right to be annexed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When a nation has expelled its &s;o|vereign, the other powers which are not wil|ling to declare again&s;t it, and would not draw on them&s;elves its arms or its enmity, con&s;ider that nation as a free and &s;overeign &s;tate, with|out taking on them&s;elves to determine wheth|er it has acted ju&s;tly in withdrawing from the allegiance of &s;ubjects and dethroning the Prince. Cardinal Mazarine received Lock|hart, who had been &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador from the republic of England, and would neither &s;ee King Charles the IId, nor his mini&s;ters. If a nation, after driving out its Prince, &s;ub|mits to another, or changes the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and acknowledges a &s;overeign to the prejudice of the natural and appointed heir; foreign powers may here likewi&s;e con&s;ider what has been done, as legal; it is no quarrel or bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs. At the beginning of the la&s;t century, Charles, duke of Suderma|nia, having obtained the crown of Sweden, to the prejudice of Sigi&s;mund king of Poland, his nephew was &s;oon acknowledged by mo&s;t &s;overeigns. <HI>Villeroy,</HI> mini&s;ter of Henry the IVth, king of France, at that court, in a me|moir of the 8th of April 1608, plainly &s;aid to the Pre&s;ident Jeannin, <HI>All the&s;e rea&s;ons and con&s;iderations &s;hall not hinder the king from treat|ing
<PB N="8" REF="035103_0009_1000B7DC8721B2E8">with Charles, if he finds it to be his intere&s;t, and that of his kingdom.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>This was arguing &s;en&s;ibly. The King of France was neither the judge nor the guar|dian of the Swedi&s;h nation, that he &s;hould, again&s;t the good of his own kingdom, refu&s;e to acknowledge the king which Sweden had cho&s;en under pretence that a competitor termed Charles an u&s;urper. Had it even been done with ju&s;tice, it does not come un|der the cognizance of foreigners.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, when foreign powers have received the mini&s;ters of an u&s;urper, and &s;ent theirs to him, the lawful prince, on recovering his throne, cannot complain of the&s;e mea&s;ures as an injury,</HI> nor ju&s;tly make them the cau&s;e of a war, provided the&s;e powers have not gone farther, nor furni&s;hed any &s;uccours again&s;t him.</P></Q>
<P>I have been the more particular in giving this extract at length, becau&s;e the que&s;tion which it con&s;iders, though frequently alluded to, has never been fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, in any of our political writings, that I have &s;een.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a French envoy arrived in this country. He is told, that our repeated emba&s;&s;ies have been &s;purned with indignity, and without a hearing from the thre&s;hold of the Directorial palace, and therefore a Mini&s;|ter from the Directory could not be received.</P>
<P>The envoy replies, <HI>[the more lies the better for his purpo&s;e]</HI><Q>I am come to explain, and make atonement for that very thing; you &s;urely cannot refu&s;e to receive reparation for inju|ries or in&s;ults." And perhaps he might add, the men who refu&s;ed your mini&s;ters were
<PB N="9" REF="035103_0010_1000B7DE223D2AD0">traitors, enemies to France as well as Ameri|ca; Merlin, and Treillard, and Rewbell, and Lepaux, and Talleyrand are taken up as con|&s;pirators, and are &s;ucceeded by the true pa|triots, the friends of both countries, who have &s;ent me to heal all differences, and re|dre&s;s all your wrongs.</Q> Even &s;etting a&s;ide, the law of nations and the right of emba&s;&s;y, tho&s;e who think our government could have with&s;tood all this, are de&s;ired to recollect <HI>town|meetings</HI> and <HI>treaty remo&s;trances,</HI> and if they are &s;till inflexible, nothing which I can &s;ay will affect their opinions.</P>
<P>I have now before me a pamphlet which though I often before heard of, I never was a|ble to obtain till within a few days. It is a hand&s;ome Paris edition. Several copies of it, directed to different characters in this country, arrived here about the middle of la&s;t &s;ummer. Some little was &s;aid re&s;pecting it at fir&s;t, but the work has been kept from the public eye. The rea&s;on is obvious. It being predicated upon the idea that the Pre&s;ident would make no nomination, it could not an&s;wer the purpo|&s;es of the French government, or their friends the American jacobins. But few federali&s;ts, it is pre&s;umed, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a copy, and tho&s;e it is probable, were them&s;elves &s;o well con|vinced of the <HI>protriety</HI> of the nomination, that they did not think there was any nece&s;&s;ity for the promulgation of information, which would place it in a more con&s;picuous light. It con|tains three letters, the fir&s;t entitled <HI>Joel Bar|low to his fellow citizens of the United States,</HI> da|ted
<PB N="10" REF="035103_0011_1000B7DFEDC9D8F8">Paris, March 4, 1799. The &s;econd <HI>Joel Barlow to General Wa&s;hington,</HI> dated Paris, Oct 2, 1798, with a note prefixed at the time of publication. The third <HI>Fulwar Skipwith and Joel Barlow to a Member of the Executive Direc|tory.</HI> The book appears to have been written by the expre&s;s order of the Directory, with a view of accellerating their plan of getting a new mini&s;ter at Philadelphia, <HI>under circum&s;tan|ces unfavourable to the United States.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall quote and comment on &s;uch parts of the work as will unfold the de&s;ing.</P>
<P>Barlow profe&s;&s;es a great deal of frankne&s;s, and is willing to allow many of the faults of the French government; a degree of candour, which any who are acquainted with <HI>their &s;y&s;|tem of ju&s;tice and police,</HI> know would be rather too dangerous an experiment, if they had not &s;ome &s;pecial purpo&s;es to an&s;wer by &s;uffering it. The Directory having heard by Citizen Logan and others, what was con&s;irmed by our war|like preparations, that the &s;pirit of this country was at length rou&s;ed by injuries upon injuries, and in&s;ults upon in&s;ults; were convinced, that it would not do for. Citizen Barlow, or any o|ther Citizen, to tell us that France had done us no wrong. This accounts for the following expre&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t letter&mdash; <Q>How much you have unfortunately &s;uffered from the pira|cies carried on under the French laws" p. 4. the attempts which had been made here to extort from our commi&s;&s;ioners a bribe to in|dividuals, and a promi&s;e of a loan to the go|vernment</Q> p. 5. <Q>No man in America could feel a greater indignation that I did at the
<PB N="11" REF="035103_0012_1000A69447BFE300">piece of villainy therein detailed</Q> (in the di&s;|patches) ibi. <Q>I had no knowledge that even a <HI>loan</HI> was a&s;ked for, or contemplated to be a&s;ked for on the part of France. It was my opinion that it was the policy of the Ameri|can government under circum&s;tances then exi&s;ting to <HI>offer</HI> a loan</Q> ibi. That mon&s;trous &s;y&s;tem <Q>of piracy and plunder exerci&s;ed to|wards neutrals</Q>&mdash;<Q>all the horrors that have attended this tremendous revolution</Q> p. 6. <Q>The innumerable acts of inju&s;tice and vio|lence committed under the order of the 2d of March 1797, and the law of the 18th of January 1798</Q> p. 7. <Q>The flood of piracy and plunder let loo&s;e upon your property; a &s;cene of wickedne&s;s which no man can abo|minate more than my&s;elf</Q> p. 36.</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by a man in the pow|er of the French government, would be &s;uffi|cient evidence, if any was wanted, that the book was penned by their direction. But the char|acter of Barlow, and his connection with, and dependence on that government, are &s;o well known to all political men in the United States, that to <HI>them</HI> the proof mu&s;t be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the letter addre&s;&s;ed to General Wa&s;hing|ton is the following pa&s;&s;age, with the accompa|nying note, added as before mentioned, when the book was publi&s;hed. The letter it &s;eems was fir&s;t &s;ent as a private one. <Q>An embargo that had been laid on American ve&s;&s;els with|in the republic in con&s;equence of a report that war had been begun on the part of the United States, was taken off as &s;oon as it was a&s;certained that &s;uch war had not been be|gun;
<PB N="12" REF="035103_0013_1000B7E19B79DBF8">and a new declaration was at that time &s;ent to America of the wi&s;hes of France to treat. 1</Q></P>
<P>NOTE. 1. <Q>Since writing this letter, I am at liberty to &s;tate that the <HI>new declaration,</HI> here referred to, was di&s;patched from Paris through an official channel about the end of Septem|ber la&s;t. It &s;hould &s;eem that it had not ar|rived at Philadelphia, before the opening of Congre&s;s in December; as the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech alludes to a declaration made to Mr. Gerry in July, but takes no notiee of this &s;ub|&s;equent one, which was perfectly explicit and unconditional.</Q> The letter adds, <Q>the&s;e facts will doubtle&s;s come to your knowledge through other channels before you receive this letter.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears that the Directory had taken mea&s;ures to &s;pread in this country the news of their offer, upon the pre&s;umption that it would not be accepted, and that this circum&s;tance would a&s;&s;i&s;t their intended mi&s;&s;ion to Philadel|phia. And it is &s;aid that duplicates of the prof|ferred a&s;&s;urances were read in jacobin meetings in Penn&s;ylvania, previous to the nomination, and that the <HI>worthy</HI> members of the&s;e meetings only waited for Congre&s;s to break up, in order to blaze them abroad.</P>
<P>But France wanted a <HI>&s;alvo,</HI> and this was rea|dily furni&s;hed by the pro&s;tituted Skip with and Barlow. The following is taken from their letter to a Member of the Executive Directory; the date it will be recollected was the 12th of February 1799. <Q>The enlightened policy which has ever animated your conduct to|wards
<PB N="13" REF="035103_0014_1000B7E471F72B10" MS="y">the United States, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> kind reception you gave that e&s;timable patriot Doctor Logan, which has been followed by the mo&s;t happy effects, induce us to addre&s;s you &s;ome reflections on the intelligence lately re|ceived from that country. We &s;hall take the liberty of expo&s;ing to you our opinion rela|tive to the be&s;t mode of &s;ilencing the ene|mies of France in America, extending and invigorating republican principles" &amp;c. &amp;c. The Congre&s;s mu&s;t ri&s;e on or before the 4th of March, (20 days from this) as the bienni|al functions of all the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, and one third of the Senate, cea&s;e on that day. Should the Pre&s;ident therefore be di&s;po&s;ed to name a mini&s;ter, he cannot do it after that day, without calling a &s;pecial meet|ing of the &s;enate; which delay would nece&s;|&s;arily throw that operation into the &s;ummer; and &s;uch mini&s;ter could not arrive in Paris till next autumn or winter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>France, &s;eated on the car of victory, is &s;urrounded with too much glory, to fear that an act of conde&s;cention &s;hould be mi&s;inter|preted, or a&s;cribed to any other cau&s;e than her own magnanimity. You would abridge the &s;ufferings of your colonies, revive the manufactures, commerce and agriculture of many parts of France, give a new triumph to republican principles, and make a better treaty than could be made under other cir|cum&s;tances, if you would &s;end a mini&s;ter im|mediately to Philadelphia." "If we dared to give a &s;ugge&s;tion on an object &s;till more delicate, we would hazard our opinion rela|tive
<PB N="14" REF="035103_0015_1000A698D4F2F9E0">to the qualities of the per&s;on whom you may charge with this mi&s;&s;ion to Philadelphia. We &s;hould invite you to choo&s;e a citizen who&s;e name and character are known and re&s;pected in America; who by his writings may have merited the e&s;teem of the two countries; a citizen, if po&s;&s;ible, who may have &s;ome ac|quaintance with our excellent philo&s;opher and patriot, Jeffer&s;on; and who&s;e known moderation, integrity and wi&s;dom &s;hall at the &s;ame time prevent his being di&s;agreeable to the opo&s;ite party; a citizen who&s;e enlighten|ed love of liberty, in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive effects, &s;hall render him proper for a negotiation which may become the &s;ource of the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive pro&s;perity.</Q></P>
<P>After reading this, can any one he&s;itate as to the expediency of the late nomination? Con|gre&s;s were ju&s;t about di&s;&s;olving without declar|ing war, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;&s;es and the buf|fetings we had &s;uffered and endured. The &s;ame con&s;titution which gives Congre&s;s the <HI>"power to declare war"</HI> gives the Pre&s;ident the <Q>pow|er by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur;</Q> to <Q>nomi|nate, and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, appoint amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters,</Q> and <HI>makes it his duty</HI> to <HI>"re|ceive</HI> amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters. The Pre&s;ident was to be left nine months the &s;ubject, (I was going to &s;ay the &s;port) of French diplomatic &s;kill. <Q>A citizen who&s;e name and character are known, and re&s;pected in A|merica</Q> was de&s;ignated, to allure us. The
<PB N="15" REF="035103_0016_1000B7E5F784F3A0"><HI>tyger</HI> was in fact <HI>crouching to leap upon his prey,</HI> but our vigilant Executive di&s;covered his <Q>mur|derous fangs peeping through the downy vel|vet of his paws,</Q> and checked the hideous mon&s;ter at the out&s;et.</P>
<P>That great &s;tate&s;man who&s;e writings &s;till il|lumine the world which his immortal part has lately left, declares in his celebrated <Q>Reflec|tions on the French Revolution</Q> that he <Q>would pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency, by varying his means to &s;ecure the unity of his end.</Q> He who has the affairs of a nation to direct, mu&s;t know to accompli&s;h this, or he will be illy fit for the tru&s;t. The feelings and pa&s;&s;ions which operate in the common intercour&s;e of mankind, ought to be di&s;carded when the fate of our country is at i&s;&s;ue. Keppel, one of the mo&s;t judicious, brave and experienced officers that the naval hi&s;tory of Britain can boa&s;t, being en|tru&s;ted with the command of the channel fleet in 1778 was accu&s;ed of having been guilty of mi&s;conduct on the 27th of July of that year. Unju&s;tly attacked in the hou&s;e of Commons, by tho&s;e who neither knew his difficulties nor re&s;ources, he calmly replied, <HI>I con&s;idered, on that day, that I had England in my hands.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps if the tide of &s;ucce&s;s had continued on the &s;ide of France, many who now complain of the nomination, would have applauded it. But I contend, that the change of fortune among the belligerent powers is an argument in favour of the policy of the mea&s;ure. We &s;hall be more likely to obtain ju&s;tice from France, while &s;he is going down hill and contending again&s;t &s;u|perior power, than we &s;hould be, were &s;he
