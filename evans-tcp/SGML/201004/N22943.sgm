<P>WHATEVER may be the re&s;ult of your approaching deliberations, the intere&s;ts of this country cannot fail to have been promoted by many of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions to which <HI>this great occa&s;ion</HI> will have given ri&s;e. The numerous addre&s;&s;es to the people at large, to the &s;tate legi&s;latures, and to your&s;elves, will often bring truth and rea&s;on into the public view, or expo&s;e to detection the impro|per mea&s;ures, which pa&s;&s;ion or unworthine&s;s have induced any of the parties to adopt.</P>
<P>It is plain, that tho&s;e, who have nece&s;&s;arily re|ply, at a very late hour, have far the harde&s;t ta&s;k, though truth were admitted to be on their &s;ide, Nothing, which can be prepared, for example, to manife&s;t all the errors of "Phocion,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phocion,</HI> after publi&s;hing about eighteen e&s;&s;ays <HI>under</HI> that &s;ignature, in the Gazette of the United States, has republi&s;hed his papers, <HI>without</HI> the &s;ignature of Phocion, in a pamphlet, entituled <HI>"The Preten&s;ions of Thomas Jeffer&s;on to the Pre&s;idency, examined; and the Charges again&s;t John Adams refuted,"</HI> &amp;c. Oc|tober, 1796. The divi&s;ion, by numbered e&s;&s;ays, under the &s;ig|nature of Phocion, as fir&s;t publi&s;hed, is abandoned in the pam|phlet. The <HI>&s;ecret</HI> rea&s;ons for this change are unknown. No rea|&s;on is given by the author, nor is there any trace of his fir&s;t form of publication.

It cannot have been meant to cau&s;e the electors to believe that there were two exten&s;ive publications again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on. It is however nece&s;&s;ary, that the electors be apprized that <HI>the number|ed e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, Phocion,</HI> is, <HI>alias,</HI> the anonymous <HI>Pamphleteer.</HI></NOTE> can po&s;&s;ibly reach in time the di&s;tant electors.</P>

The opinions of Mr. Adams in favour of an <HI>he|reditary</HI> pre&s;ident and of an <HI>hereditary</HI> &s;enate, and his de&s;ire to &s;ee them introduced among us, are <HI>the great objections</HI> to him, which prevail conclu&s;ively with all the friends of the federal con&s;titution, who are oppo&s;ed to his election. Hence we &s;ee, <HI>that though Mr. Pinckney is under&s;tood to be &s;et up by the &s;ame per&s;ons,</HI> no objections whatever have been made to him. This gentleman gives ri&s;e to <HI>no alarms</HI> even among the friends of other candidates, becau&s;e he is univer&s;ally admitted to be <HI>attached to repre&s;enta|tive or elective government.</HI> Nay, even the papers characterized as anti-federal and jacobin, have not &s;ounded any alarm concerning <HI>the republican</HI> Pinck|ney.</P>
<P>The friends and enemies of the federal con&s;titu|tion have been accu&s;tomed to believe, that GENE|RAL WASHINGTON is a <HI>lover of repre&s;entative go|vernment.</HI> It has been a cau&s;e of <HI>devout thankfulne&s;s to Providence,</HI> in the minds of &s;erious and anxious men, that <HI>this friend to republics</HI> was in the chair, when the combined powers a&s;&s;ociated to re&s;tore mo|narchy in France, in 1791; and particularly in 1793, when the king of Great-Britain i&s;&s;ued, <HI>within the &s;ame week</HI> (Oct. 31, and Nov. 6, 1793) a public

If the friends of repre&s;entative government cheri&s;hed with thankfulne&s;s this comfortable truth, what will they now think and feel, if they behold the high pre&s;idential authority in the hands of one, who has no faith, no confidence in repre&s;entative or elective government, who believes, <HI>with the jealous enemies of our con&s;titution abroad,</HI> that a monarchical con&s;titution is not only better than our federal con|&s;titution, but that a mixed monarchy is "the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of <HI>all po&s;&s;ible</HI> governments." A&s;k your&s;elves, re&s;pec|table, but highly re&s;pon&s;ible tru&s;tees of a de&s;erving nation's peace, before it &s;hall be too late, can the people of America be hoped to confide in &s;uch <HI>a con&s;tituted authority?</HI></P>
<P>The letters of "Phocion" have been principally confined to the rejection of Mr. Jeffer&s;on. He &s;ays enough, it is true, to cover him&s;elf from the charge of neglecting Mr. Adams. Yet he certainly has not taken up and explained any of the pa&s;&s;ages, in favor of hereditary government, which a wi&s;e and zealous advocate would (if he could) have openly &s;eized and refuted. This is a ca&s;e in which the ve|ry horns of the adver&s;ary, if we may u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion, &s;hould have been taken hold of with intrepi|dity.

<P>In treating of the Lacedemonian government, <HI>which was hereditary</HI> in <HI>the kings and &s;enators,</HI> in the two hundred and fifty-fifth page of the fir&s;t volume, of the London edition, Mr. Adams writes the fol|lowing words&mdash;</P>

<P>THE philo&s;ophical talents of Mr. Jeffer&s;on are denied by Phocion, and yet they are repre&s;ent|ed by him as di&s;qualifications for the office of Pre&s;i|dent. Nothing can more clearly evince the perver|&s;ion of Phocion's judgment, which his overween|ing prejudices have produced, than that a man of his manife&s;t &s;en&s;e and knowledge &s;hould have given expre&s;&s;ion to &s;uch an opinion.</P>
<P>Permit me, gentlemen, to offer a few que&s;tions to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Were the <HI>ordinary</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;igned</HI> duties of the de|partment of &s;tate <HI>ever</HI> procra&s;tinated by philo&s;ophi|cal avocations on the part of Mr. Jeffer&s;on? Was he not <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> attentive to his duties, as a commi&s;|&s;ioner for patenting di&s;coveries, improvements, and learning? Did his philo&s;ophical talents di&s;qualify him for tho&s;e duties? Did the board of tru&s;tees of the &s;inking fund <HI>ever</HI> &s;it without his pre&s;ence, when he was at the &s;eat of government? Were the duties of the &s;cientific <HI>Governor Bowdoin</HI> le&s;s punctually and firmly performed, in the in&s;urrectional &s;ea&s;on of 1786, becau&s;e he, like Jeffer&s;on, was a philo&s;opher? Did the &s;ervices of Franklin, as the agent of <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI> in England, or in France, as the <HI>American commi&s;&s;ioner,</HI> &s;u&s;tain <HI>any</HI> diminution of their effect from philo&s;ophical ab&s;tractions? When both par|ties on his return to the di&s;tracted &s;tate of Penn&s;yl|vania,
<PB N="10" REF="030293_0008_0FE5AA82F3B76528">importuned the philo&s;opher Franklin to ac|cept the executive government, had they not been long taught by his <HI>exemplary</HI> punctuality, how <HI>a love of &s;cience</HI> and political duties may be united? Were <HI>Bolingbroke, Addi&s;on, Cicero,</HI> or <HI>Maecenas,</HI> le&s;s able politicians, becau&s;e they cultivated learning or che|ri&s;hed learned men? Did Mr. Jeffer&s;on le&s;s ably per|form the duties of an American mini&s;ter in France, becau&s;e he has re&s;cued our unknown country from the mi&s;repre&s;entations of Buffon? Would a pre&s;i|dent of the United States relax with le&s;s propriety from his public labors, in a philo&s;ophical <HI>library,</HI> than in a theatre, or a ball room? Apologizing for the trouble, which has been given in obviating this prepo&s;terous objection to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, we may conclude with reminding the electors, that Frede|rick the &s;econd, the &s;aviour of the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> cau&s;e, the illu&s;trious atchiever of military and civil prodi|gies, having for the la&s;t time reviewed the army, which guarded his capital, &s;pent the remainder of the day in conver&s;ing with the foreign mini&s;ters re|&s;ident at his court, upon the <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> experi|ments of Spalanzani. The ob&s;ervations of Frede|rick, &s;ays the elegant Gillies, marked his <HI>philo&s;ophi|cal turn of mind.</HI></P>
<P>It was in vain, that Phocion attempted to excite again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on the di&s;plea&s;ure of the friends of the blacks in the city of Philadelphia, becau&s;e he guardedly "advances a &s;u&s;picion,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I advance it, therefore, as <HI>a &s;u&s;picion only,</HI>" are the words of Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Page 239, London edition.</NOTE> that the ne|groes are inferior, either naturally or factitiou&s;ly, in &s;everal particulars to the white race. It was known in Penn&s;ylvania, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on had propo&s;ed for con&s;ideration an un-adopted article in the declarati|on of independence, cen&s;uring the kings of Great Britain for annulling the American laws to prohi|bit
<PB N="11" REF="030293_0009_0FE5AA88AC926680">the &s;lave trade. It was known too, that he had introduced a bill into the legi&s;lature of Virginia, at their fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion after the declaration of independ|ence, and that he had finally carried <HI>the mo&s;t ancient</HI> law of the&s;e &s;tates <HI>aboli&s;hing that trade,</HI> though not to emancipate the &s;laves here. It is plain to every man who has pre&s;erved a calm judgment on the &s;ubject, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on's &s;entiments in favour of the <HI>unborn po&s;terity</HI> of the blacks [for that is <HI>all</HI> he mentions] though never acted upon, from proper rea&s;ons, are evidences of his regard for them and for the general liberty of mankind, <HI>&s;o much the &s;trong|er</HI> as he may think the blacks inferior to the whites. If he conceives this ill-fated de&s;cription of men in|ferior to our&s;elves in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> powers of their minds, it is &s;urely humane, it is &s;urely magnani|mous to have thought of propo&s;ing for their po&s;|terity, the elevating condition of political liberty, at a future day.</P>
<P>Phocion next endeavours to alarm the &s;outhern &s;tates upon the &s;ubject of their &s;laves. Mr. Jeffer|&s;on's &s;entiments, &s;o far as they were again&s;t the ca|pacities of the blacks, had been ju&s;t <HI>played upon,</HI> in order to deprive him of votes in Philadelphia and its vicinity. And, &s;trange as it may appear in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> writer, Mr. Jeffer&s;on's dormant &s;entiments of kind|ne&s;s to <HI>the po&s;terity</HI> of the blacks, were employed to injure him with the &s;outhern planters. It was for|gotten by Phocion, that the &s;tate of Virginia began, in the earlie&s;t &s;tages of the revolution, the abolition of the &s;lave bu&s;ine&s;s, and that South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, and Delaware, have <HI>all</HI> &s;ince followed her. Penn&s;ylvania, and all north of her have al&s;o <HI>followed.</HI> How then could Phocion expect to render Mr. Jeffer&s;on obnoxious by a dormant propo&s;ition, draughted by a committee near twenty years ago, which has &s;ince been countenanced by all the &s;tate legi&s;latures, but that of Georgia. To
<PB N="12" REF="030293_0010_0FE5AA5F699E01C8">&s;peak in the milde&s;t terms, &s;uch unguarded <HI>conver|&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> argument, prove the writer to be under the influence of pa&s;&s;ions &s;o bewildering, that the electors cannot &s;afely confide in any of his re|pre&s;entations.</P>
<P><HI>Jeffer&s;on</HI> and <HI>Buffon</HI> are divided about the blacks. The latter rather believes them equal to the whites. &mdash;Jeffer&s;on <HI>doubts,</HI> but he qualifies all his ob&s;erva|tions like a circum&s;pect philo&s;opher, and a philan|thropi&s;t. His words are (page 239, London edition) <Q>I advance it therefore as <HI>a &s;u&s;picion only,</HI> that the blacks, whether originally a di&s;tinct race, or <HI>made di&s;tinct by time and circum&s;tances,</HI> are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of rea&s;on and imagination, <HI>mu&s;t be ha|zarded with great diffidence.</HI> To ju&s;tify a <HI>general</HI> conclu&s;ion, requires <HI>many</HI> ob&s;ervations, even where the &s;ubject may be &s;ubmitted to the anatomical knife, to optical gla&s;&s;es, to analy&s;is by fire, or by &s;olvents. <HI>How much more then</HI> where it is a facul|ty, not a &s;ub&s;tance, we are examining; where it eludes the re&s;earch of all the &s;en&s;es; where the conditions of its exi&s;tence are various, and vari|ou&s;ly combined; where the effects of tho&s;e which are pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent bid defiance to calculation; let me add too, <HI>as a circum&s;tance of great tender|ne&s;s,</HI> where our conclu&s;ion would degrade <HI>a whole race of men</HI> from the rank <HI>in the &s;cale of beings</HI> which <HI>their Creator</HI> may, perhaps, have given them?</Q> I challenge Phocion to adduce a &s;uperior example of philo&s;ophy, philanthropy, and religion.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider <HI>the ameliorated &s;tate of man</HI> in the clo&s;e of this eighteenth century&mdash;when we bear in mind the improvements in agriculture, in manu|factures, in commercial operations, in navigation, in coinage and finance, in the ordering and ap|pointment of the public force, in the fine and u&s;e|ful
<PB N="13" REF="030293_0011_0FE5AA6BE94D70C8">arts, in didactic in&s;titutions, in &s;cience, and in the &s;ublime theories of <HI>&s;ocial</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> duties, which di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ent generation, we nece&s;|&s;arily conceive <HI>exalted</HI> ideas of the <HI>progre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>ca|pacities</HI> of the human &s;pecies. But when we remem|ber how generally the inventions and acqui&s;itions enumerated, are diffu&s;ed among the <HI>white</HI> nations, and how &s;mall a portion of them have been invent|ed or acquired by the <HI>colored</HI> nations, from <HI>the com|mon &s;tarting time</HI> of univer&s;al barbari&s;m to this day of <HI>tran&s;cendent</HI> illumination, we may, without crime, entertain <HI>"the &s;u&s;picion"</HI> of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, that the blacks are <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> in a &s;tate of actual inferiority, whether natural or factitious.</P>
<P>Phocion has roundly a&s;&s;erted (page 5, lines 7, 8, and 9) that Mr. Jeffer&s;on <Q>had once formed the extravagant project of <HI>emancipating all the &s;laves</HI> in Virginia.</Q> Such are Phocion's words. That idea, however, is not to be found in Mr. Jeffer&s;on's book, to which Phocion refers as his authority! The whole body of the &s;laves in Virginia, young as well middle-aged and old, were left, by the draught of the propo&s;ition, <HI>as the laws had placed them,</HI> in the hands <HI>of the owners,</HI> and <HI>the unimpaired property</HI> of tho&s;e owners. It was only the <HI>future</HI> offspring, <HI>the po&s;te|rity</HI> of the exi&s;ting &s;laves, which this unreported draught of a propo&s;ition of the legi&s;lative committee, <HI>in the &s;malle&s;t degree,</HI> contemplated or included. Not one &s;ingle per&s;on, who would be a &s;lave, at the fu|ture date of the intended act was to be emancipated. Such children alone <HI>as &s;hould be born after</HI> the pa&s;&s;|ing of a propo&s;ed law, were to take their <HI>chance</HI> of the propo&s;ition, if it &s;hould be offered to the legi&s;|lature. But the propo&s;ition was never offered, for &s;erious rea&s;ons. The committee kept it from the le|gi&s;lature. It was only hi&s;torically related in Mr. Jef|fer&s;on's <HI>"Notes on Virginia."</HI> The electors will con|&s;ider,
<PB N="14" REF="030293_0012_0FE5AA8A884F55A8">with <HI>a judiciary prudence and &s;olemnity,</HI> the confidence they are to repo&s;e in the future te&s;timo|ny of the &s;elf-deceived <HI>Phocion.</HI> For our part, we impute not to him malignity or voluntary mi&s;repre|&s;entation. We only affirm him to be <HI>completely blind|ed</HI> by aggravated prejudices.</P>
<P>In certain pa&s;&s;ages of Phocion's 5th, 6th, and 7th pages, and particularly in the la&s;t paragraph of his &s;ixth page, he charges Mr. Jeffer&s;on with the de&s;ign of having the &s;laves <HI>"tran&s;ported"</HI>&mdash; "&s;hipt off to &s;ome <HI>other</HI> country"&mdash;"&s;hipt off, <HI>like a herd of black cattle,</HI> God knows where"&mdash;and even with the de&s;ign of having them <Q><HI>&s;uddenly &s;eized, bound, packed on board ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t their con&s;ent, ex|ported</HI> to &s;ome <HI>le&s;s friendly</HI> regions, where they would be <HI>all murdered</HI> or <HI>reduced to a more wretch|ed &s;tate of &s;lavery.</HI></Q> Let a faithful extract from Mr. Jeffer&s;on's book give you tho&s;e unreported ideas of the committee, of which the tran&s;ported Phocion has twice printed the above &s;hocking mi&s;repre&s;entati|on. It &s;hould be premi&s;ed, that the legi&s;lature had appointed Mr. Jeffer&s;on on a committee to revi&s;e the laws of Virginia, with a &s;ettled view, among other things, to &s;uch amendments as <HI>"republicani&s;m"</HI> and con&s;i&s;tency required. They were con&s;cious that a new and &s;olemn declaration of <HI>the equal birth-rights of men,</HI> was contained in the act of independence &mdash;<HI>the ju&s;tificatory manife&s;to of the United States.</HI> This too they con&s;idered as the cau&s;e, <HI>at the awful i&s;&s;ue of arms,</HI> between America and Great-Britain. They viewed it, no doubt, as <HI>the end</HI> for which the &s;word had been un&s;heathed, and as <HI>the cardinal maxim</HI> of that <HI>republicani&s;m,</HI> to which they were appointed to conform the Virginia laws. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances they &s;ketched, <HI>not what the di&s;tempered ima|gination of Phocion has pictured to him&s;elf,</HI> but a clau&s;e for the propo&s;ed bill, which, if adopted, would go, as Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;tates it, <Q>to emancipate all &s;laves

Nor do we find any appearance of a de&s;ign to <HI>"&s;hip off"</HI> the <HI>po&s;tnati</HI> children of the colored people to <HI>le&s;s friendly</HI> regions. But, re&s;pectable electors, <HI>what</HI> &s;hall be thought concerning the motives of Phoci|on, in charging Mr. Jeffer&s;on with the de&s;ign of <Q><HI>&s;uddenly &s;eizing&mdash;binding&mdash;packing on board ve&s;&s;els</HI> &mdash;and <HI>again&s;t their wills, exporting the freed blacks</HI> to &s;ome le&s;s <HI>friendly</HI> regions, where they would be <HI>all reduced to a wor&s;e &s;lavery</HI> or <HI>murdered?</HI></Q> It is not our duty for ever to defend the well-informed Phocion from the emotions of di&s;e&s;teem, which his mi&s;repre&s;entations mu&s;t excite in the &s;erious minds
<PB N="16" REF="030293_0014_0FE5AA8DEA518AB8">of per&s;ons, &s;o &s;elect, as are the pre&s;idential electors.

<P>We have already noticed the obligations, re&s;ult|ing from &s;lavery in America and Virginia, under which the legi&s;lature of Virginia, Mr. Jeffer&s;on and his colleagues, all &s;eemed to &s;tand. That &s;tate pro|bably contained at the time 200,000 &s;laves. The&s;e could be as well accommodated upon two millions of acres of land, as the white people of many farming counties of Penn&s;ylvania, New Jer&s;ey, New York, and New England now are. The &s;tate of Virginia, even after the ce&s;&s;ion of the north-we&s;tern territo|ry, contained near &s;eventy-eight millions of acres, be&s;ides their remote lands, <HI>then unceded,</HI> beyond the Ohio.

It is manife&s;t that no <HI>tran&s;ma|rine</HI> place, requiring them to be "packed in ve&s;&s;els" and "&s;hipt off," could have been nece&s;&s;ary or in|tended, becau&s;e Virginia had immen&s;e tracts of di&s;|tant and fertile lands on which they could have been <HI>"protected."</HI> She had no tran&s;marine territo|ry; nor could a &s;tate, without a navy, protect them in a tran&s;marine &s;ituation. A &s;imilar plan, on a &s;mall &s;cale, was formerly meditated in Penn&s;ylva|nia, and it has many features of that plan, which THE PRESIDENT is now endeavouring to introduce among the Indian tribes.

<HEAD>No. III. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Re&s;pectable Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN unre&s;erved declaration of Mr. Adams in favor of monarchy and nobility, was &s;ubmit|ted to you in the clo&s;e of my fir&s;t paper. That de|claration is predicated upon the Lacedemonian go|vernment &mdash;an <HI>ancient</HI> example. Permit me now to &s;ubmit to you one equally unequivocal, of <HI>recent</HI> date. In his fifty-fourth letter, page 371, vol. I. Lon|don edition, Mr. Adams writes the following words:</P>
<P><Q>The improvements to be made in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, lie <HI>entirely</HI> in the hou&s;e of commons. If county-members were aboli&s;hed, and repre&s;en|tatives proportionally and frequently cho&s;en in
<PB N="18" REF="030293_0016_0FE5AA926A492E18">&s;mall di&s;tricts, and if no candidate could be cho&s;|en, but an e&s;tabli&s;hed, long-&s;ettled inhabitant of that di&s;trict, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to corrupt the people of England, and <HI>the hou&s;e of commons</HI> might be an immortal guardian of the national liberty. <HI>In&s;tead of projects to aboli&s;h kings and lords,</HI> if the hou&s;e of commons had been attended to, wild wars would not have been engaged in, nor countle&s;s millions thrown away, <HI>nor would there have remained an imperfection, perhaps, in the Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution!</HI></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are among Mr. Adams's <HI>general concluding</HI> ob&s;ervations, at the end of a volume which, though &s;ince called <HI>"the fir&s;t,"</HI> appears to have been then completed, as a di&s;tinct and entire work. He is not treating of England, but writing what he calls his <HI>"Conclu&s;ion"</HI> of the work. After having review|ed all the governments of ancient and modern times, (and England among them two hundred pages back) <HI>he again calls up</HI> and <HI>holds fa&s;t to</HI> that particu|lar form, which he thinks perfect in the two heredi|tary branches, and be&s;t upon the whole. It is not a tran&s;itory &s;ally in the career of compo&s;ition. No. &mdash;It is <HI>a part of a concluding &s;umming up, and defini|tive judgment</HI> upon <HI>all</HI> he had read, <HI>all</HI> he had writ|ten, <HI>all he had thought.</HI> He decidedly conveys the idea, by the faire&s;t and mo&s;t direct inference, that it is no fault in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution to have <HI>an hereditary king</HI>&mdash;no fault to have <HI>an hereditary nobili|ty</HI> &mdash;that all which it is po&s;&s;ible to do to improve the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, "lies <HI>entirely</HI> in the hou&s;e of commons." He di&s;countenances all de&s;ires and en|deavours to aboli&s;h the kingly and noble powers, and clearly conveys it as his decided opinion, that if the hou&s;e of commons could only be made a hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the king and the lords would be, not even <HI>"imperfections."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030293_0017_0FE5AA947B8401F8">
But as the&s;e unequivocal opinions, predicated up|on the ca&s;es of an <HI>ancient</HI> and an <HI>exi&s;ting</HI> hereditary monarchy and nobility, are capable of additions of a &s;imilar nature, let us a&s;k of you, as ju&s;t and pa|tient judges, a little more attention to this impor|tant witne&s;s in the pending cau&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;peaking of the cour&s;e of events, which preceded the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the univer&s;al military de&s;poti&s;m, which prevailed on the continent of Eu|rope in 1786, in the twenty-third page of the pre|face to the fir&s;t volume of the London edition, Mr. Adams warns all tho&s;e nations <HI>not to adopt repre&s;en|tative government in more than one branch,</HI> even tho' they &s;hould proceed <HI>by &s;low and gentle degrees,</HI> and <HI>after diffu&s;ing education</HI> and <HI>informing the public mind.</HI></P>
<P>He ob&s;erves to the Europeans, that <Q>kings, no|bles, and people, claimed the government in turn: and after all the turbulence, wars, and revolutions which compo&s;ed the hi&s;tory of Europe for &s;o many ages, we find <HI>&s;imple</HI> monarchies <HI>(i. e. by kings alone)</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed every where. Whether the &s;y&s;|tem will now become &s;tationary, and la&s;t for ever, by means of a few further improvements in mo|narchical governments, we know not; or whe|ther &s;till further revolutions are to come. The <HI>mo&s;t probable</HI> or rather <HI>the only probable change</HI> is, the introduction of <HI>democratical branches</HI> into tho&s;e governments. If <HI>the people</HI> &s;hould <HI>ever</HI> aim at <HI>more," continues Mr. Adams "they will defeat them|&s;elves;</HI> and indeed if they aim at this, by any other than gentle means, and by gradual advances, by improvements in general education, and inform|ing the public mind.</Q> Here Mr. Adams declares to the world, that if the people of Germany, France, Holland, Flanders, &amp;c. &s;hould <HI>ever</HI> make a trial of <HI>&s;uch a pre&s;ident and &s;enate as ours,</HI> or <HI>any &s;ub&s;titute whatever, for their emperors, kings, &s;tadtholders, and nobles,</HI> they will adopt a kind of government which
<PB N="20" REF="030293_0018_0FE5AA960C7B6770">cannot la&s;t&mdash;they will lo&s;e their labor&mdash;<HI>"they will defeat them&s;elves"</HI>&mdash;They mu&s;t combine, as he con|ceives, <HI>hereditary</HI> power with the repre&s;entative prin|ciple. On this occa&s;ion it is important to remark (and the remark appears indeed very important) that this worthy citizen frequently falls into, and in|culcates, the dangerous mi&s;take, that an accurate and effectual &s;eparation of the di&s;tinct powers of govern|ment, involves the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of three <HI>"orders"</HI> among the members of the &s;ociety. The Americans generally a&s;&s;erted and practi&s;ed the&s;e three divi&s;ions of governmental powers, <HI>long before</HI> the commencement of Mr. Adams's work; and to this day there are no <HI>"orders"</HI> among the American people. Mr. Adams mu&s;t believe, as a con&s;i&s;tent po|litician, that in adopting <HI>an elective pre&s;ident and &s;e|nate,</HI> we al&s;o are "to defeat our&s;elves," and in his opinion, yet to return to kings and nobles; or he mu&s;t con&s;ider us as, <HI>in nature,</HI> different from the re&s;t of men.&mdash;After thus <HI>emphatically</HI> giving the world his opinions in favor of the <HI>excellency</HI> and <HI>per|fection</HI> of an ancient and a modern government, which are both hereditary in two branches, and after holding out to all the nations of Europe&mdash;the whole civili&s;ed world, that no &s;tate of individual education, or public illumination, could enable them to adopt and continue an elective chief magi&s;trate or an e|lective &s;enate, Mr. Adams proceeds, as far as any American could venture, in rai&s;ing di&s;confidence, and in &s;ugge&s;ting arguments, even again&s;t our own con&s;titutions, of which his title-page promi&s;ed <HI>"a defence."</HI> He quotes, as the text of his counter-arguments, this a&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Marchamont Nedham,</HI> an European republican writer. <HI>Nedham,</HI> calmly according with the true &s;pirit and nature of the con|&s;titution of the United States, had written above a century ago, <Q>that it is but rea&s;on, that the peo|ple &s;hould &s;ee, that <HI>none</HI> be intere&s;ted in the &s;u|preme
<PB N="21" REF="030293_0019_0FE5AA97E32BD090">authority, but per&s;ons of their own elec|tion, and &s;uch as mu&s;t in a &s;hort time, return again into the &s;ame condition with them&s;elves.</Q> Now, Mr. Adams, in what he calls <HI>defending</HI> the con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and our other &s;tate con&s;titutions, and with the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titu|tion before him (for this addition to his fir&s;t and &s;econd books was publi&s;hed in 1788, and contains a copy of the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of the United States) I &s;ay, Mr. Adams, with the&s;e things before him, thus counter argues the truly federal and or|thodox pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Nedham,</HI> which has been ju&s;t quoted. "The Americans," &s;ays Mr. Adams, "have agreed with this writer in the &s;entiment:" and he then quotes the above words of <HI>Nedham,</HI> as I have ju&s;t tran&s;cribed them from his defence. But Mr. Adams then proceeds to &s;ay, <HI>"This hazardous experiment"</HI> (of intere&s;ting none in the &s;upreme power, but of their own election) <Q>they, the A|mericans, have tried; and if elections are &s;oberly made, it <HI>may</HI> an&s;wer very well; but if parties, factions, drunkenne&s;s, bribes, armies, and deli|rium come in, <HI>as they always have done, &s;ooner or later,</HI> to embroil and decide every thing, the people mu&s;t again have recour&s;e to conventions, and find a remedy. Neither philo&s;ophy nor po|licy has yet di&s;covered any other cure, than by prolonging the duration of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate and &s;enators. The evil may be <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> and <HI>po&s;t|poned,</HI> by elections for longer periods of years, till they become <HI>for life;</HI> and if this is not found an adequate remedy, there will remain no other but to make them <HI>hereditary.</HI> The delicacy or the dread of unpopularity, that &s;hould induce any man to conceal this important <HI>truth</HI> from the full view and contemplation of the people, would be a weakne&s;s, if not a vice.</Q> This pa&s;&s;age, to|gether
<PB N="22" REF="030293_0020_0FE5AA9D509B7700">with the i&s;&s;ue of our experiment which Mr. Adams inculcates <HI>by the force of all pa&s;t examples,</HI> throws a perfect light upon his meaning, when he &s;ays that the people of the European governments "will defeat them&s;elves" if they aim at <HI>more</HI> than <HI>one branch</HI> in the three divi&s;ions of power. For the evils of a chief magi&s;trate and &s;enate, that are <HI>elec|tive,</HI> that is, which are not hereditary, Mr. Adams &s;ays, neither philo&s;ophy nor policy has yet di&s;co|vered any other cure, than by prolonging the dura|tion of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate and &s;enators. It may prove that <HI>his cure</HI> is the <HI>greater</HI> evil. <HI>He omits all notice</HI> of the excellent federal plan of &s;electing elec|tors from the ma&s;s of the nation by <HI>the legi&s;latures,</HI> or by <HI>the people. He has conceded nothing</HI> to our re|jecting all hot and ambitious young men, of how|ever powerful connections, till <HI>thirty,</HI> from the &s;e|nate; and till <HI>thirty-five</HI> from the pre&s;idency.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;enate of members who have been nine years in <HI>private</HI> and <HI>public</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, and who have pa&s;&s;ed the "hey-day of the "blood," are a &s;afer and more natural ari&s;tocracy than the Bri|ti&s;h hou&s;e of lords. The &s;enate of the United States is &s;uperior to the Briti&s;h &s;enate, con&s;idering <HI>numbers,</HI> and <HI>the means of pub|lic education</HI> in this country. Perhaps it might be &s;aid, con&s;ider|ing <HI>numbers</HI> only.</NOTE> "The evils," &s;ays he, <Q>may be le&s;&s;ened or po&s;t|poned by elections for longer terms, or <HI>for life,</HI> and if this is not found an adequate remedy, there will remain <HI>no other,</HI> but to make them <HI>he|reditary.</HI></Q> But &s;urely there does remain the above excellent mode in our federal con&s;titution. It is very important to repeat that Mr. Adams pub|li&s;hed this volume in the year 1788, after he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the excellent federal con&s;titution, un|der which we now live. It appears plainly that he did not treat our admirable mode of cha&s;ing elec|tors of the chief magi&s;trate, or that of electing fe|deral &s;enators by the &s;tate legi&s;latures, as in any wi&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="030293_0021_0FE598D8959884C8">materially better than an election directly by the people, or as mea&s;ures, which would do more than to "dimini&s;h" or <Q>po&s;tpone the evils of a tempo|rary pre&s;ident and &s;enate.</Q> Conceding nothing to the&s;e invaluable ideas in the federal con&s;titution, he pa&s;&s;es over them to the object of his expectation and of his approbation, <HI>hereditary</HI> chief magi&s;trates and &s;enators. Seriou&s;ly and perfectly con&s;cious, that he was leading his countrymen on to <HI>the goal of hereditary power,</HI> Mr. Adams concludes with ob&s;erving, <Q>that the delicacy or dread of unpopu|larity, that &s;hould induce any man to conceal this important <HI>truth</HI> from the full view and con|templation of the people, would be a weakne&s;s, if not a vice.</Q> What Mr. Adams wi&s;hes to be the i&s;&s;ue of <HI>our</HI> "hazardous experiment" of <HI>elective</HI> government, cannot be doubted, when we remem|ber his unqualified and conclu&s;ive &s;entences in &s;peaking of the Lacedemonian <HI>hereditary</HI> govern|ment, and of the Briti&s;h <HI>hereditary</HI> government, and of all the new governments, which may be produced by reform in Europe. As no man will impute to Mr. Adams a want of candor, it cannot be doubted, that he would declare him&s;elf not de|&s;irous to continue our pre&s;ent repre&s;entative go|vernment. In the &s;ame vein of &s;apping our confi|dence in elective government and of inculcating the expectation and <HI>the inevitable coming</HI> of hereditary government, Mr. Adams has &s;poken in the two hundred and eighty-&s;econd page of the third Lon|don volume. The &s;ame <HI>Nedham</HI> had ob&s;erved, that <Q><HI>the life of liberty</HI> and <HI>the only remedy again&s;t &s;elf-intere&s;t,</HI> lies in <HI>the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of powers and per|&s;ons.</Q> Although this remark of <HI>Nedham</HI> per|fectly accords with the provi&s;ions of the federal con&s;titution, which is printed in the volume, and with all our <HI>defended</HI> American con&s;titutions, and though neither <HI>Nedham</HI> nor our federal con&s;tituti|on
<PB N="24" REF="030293_0022_0FE5AAA0D1F050D0">mentioned any <HI>&s;uch &s;hort</HI> terms for our public officers or &s;enators, yet Mr. Adams opens his re|plication with &s;ugge&s;tions concerning mere "<HI>annu|al</HI> elections," and then proceeds, from this <HI>lea&s;t ap|proved</HI> term of executive and &s;enatorial election, to doubts and arguments of example, and to various alarms and &s;ugge&s;tions <HI>again&s;t elective</HI> and <HI>in favor of hereditary</HI> governors and &s;enators. Let his own words be taken.</P>
<P><Q><HI>If the life of liberty, and the only remedy again&s;t &s;elf-intere&s;t, lies in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of powers and per|&s;ons,</HI></Q> &s;ays Mr. Adams, thus repeating <HI>Nedham</HI>'s words, <Q>the United States of America have taken the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to &s;ecure that life and that remedy, in e&s;tabli&s;hing annual elections of their governors, &s;enators, and repre&s;entatives. This," he continues, "will probably be allowed to be <HI>as perfect</HI> an e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of powers and per&s;ons, <HI>as human laws can make;</HI> but in what manner <HI>annual</HI> elections of gover|nors and &s;enators will operate, remains to be a&s;|certained. It &s;hould always be remembered, that this is not the fir&s;t experiment that was ever made in the world, of <HI>elections to great offices of &s;tate:</HI> how they have hitherto operated, in <HI>every</HI> great nation, and what has been their <HI>end,</HI> is <HI>ve|ry well known.</HI>" "<HI>Mankind,"</HI> &s;ays Mr. Adams, have <HI>univer&s;ally di&s;covered</HI> that <HI>chance</HI> was prefer-able to a corrupt choice, and <HI>have tru&s;ted Provi|dence rather than them&s;elves.</HI> Fir&s;t magi&s;trates and &s;enators <HI>had better be made hereditary at once,</HI> than that the people &s;hould be <HI>univer&s;ally debauched and bribed, go to loggerheads, and fly to arms regu|larly every year.</HI> Thank heaven!

<P>It is very true, re&s;pectable electors&punc; that this is not the fir&s;t experiment ever made in the world, of elections to great offices of &s;tate, but it is likewi&s;e true, that ours are the fir&s;t, that ever were made in <HI>genuine</HI> republican governments of <HI>equal birth-rights</HI> and of <HI>equal repre&s;entation.</HI> It is al&s;o true, that the <HI>&s;ecretion,</HI> if we may &s;o &s;peak, <HI>of electors of the exe|cutive,</HI> from the ma&s;s of the nation, by the opera|tion of <HI>legi&s;lative or popular choice,</HI> and the meeting of <HI>all</HI> the pre&s;idential electors <HI>on the &s;ame day</HI> in &s;ixteen <HI>&s;everal</HI> places and boards, which cannot, by rea&s;on of this <HI>&s;eparation,</HI> be controled by <HI>a mob</HI> or <HI>an army,</HI> or inflame one another, have <HI>never</HI> before been tried. The excluding from the pre&s;idency, men who are too young to have manife&s;ted their cha|racters, the obligation on the electors to &s;elect one per&s;on out of two, from <HI>another</HI> grand divi&s;ion of the empire, the excellent provi&s;ions for <HI>vacancies</HI> and <HI>vitiated elections</HI> through the vice-pre&s;ident, the pre|&s;ident of the &s;enate, and the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; the &s;trong intere&s;t, the duty, and the power of each of the <HI>&s;tate governments</HI> to protect their re&s;pective boards of electors from vi|olence and interruption, are <HI>new</HI> guards and &s;ure|ties.</P>

Let me not be &s;u&s;pected of di&s;re&s;pect in ob&s;erv|ing, that Mr. Adams could do no good, by holding up in 1788, when the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in&s;urrection was ju&s;t quelled, any eligibility in <HI>"chance"</HI> go|vernors, as he unwarily, though correctly, calls <HI>hereditary</HI> magi&s;trates. The argument, in regard to <HI>"mankind tru&s;ting Providence rather than them|&s;elves,"</HI> appears to be a kind of religious &s;ophi&s;m&mdash;a &s;ugge&s;tion, which might rather have been expect|ed from a per&s;on of a &s;uper&s;titious imbecility, than from one of a firm and illuminated piety. It is a very bad argument, however, becau&s;e it proves too much. For, if we are bound by religious duty to tru&s;t Providence rather than our&s;elves (reviving the divine rights of civil rulers) in regard to pre&s;idents and &s;enators, we mu&s;t beware <HI>of taking our public concerns out of the hands of Providence,</HI> by electing <HI>repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>

<P>MERE verbal di&s;putes have been often the cau&s;es of the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, danger, and injury.

<PB N="28" REF="030293_0026_0FE5AA6DC7A104A8">mini&s;ter, who &s;hould have pre&s;ented to the king a draught of a proclamation, or other official act, terming that government <HI>"a republic,"</HI> or, <HI>"a com|monwealth,"</HI> would certainly be expo&s;ed to very &s;erious con&s;equences. A member of their legi&s;la|ture, who &s;hould move an addre&s;s to the king, or a bill for con&s;ideration, &s;tyling Great-Britain <HI>"a commonwealth,"</HI> or <HI>"a republic,"</HI> would be very fortunate, particularly in the&s;e times, if he e&s;caped with being called and <HI>compelled</HI> to order. Some writers, who have u&s;ed the word <HI>"republic,"</HI> &s;ince the re&s;toration of the &s;econd Charles, have been treated with the mo&s;t acrimonious critici&s;m; and the hou&s;e of commons, even on the oppo&s;ition &s;ide, has been the public theatre of &s;arca&s;ms and denun|ciations again&s;t <HI>"republics."</HI> The members of the minority it&s;elf, have repelled the charge of <HI>"repub|licani&s;m,"</HI> as a damning imputation. It is <HI>the ap|propriate name</HI> for the mo&s;t extreme ho&s;tility to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams perfectly well knows the &s;en&s;e in which the <HI>practical</HI> and <HI>theoretical</HI> politicians of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and, at lea&s;t, the <HI>practical</HI> politicians of Eng|land, under&s;tand and u&s;e the words republican and republic. They all con&s;ider <HI>"a republic"</HI> and <HI>"a monarchy"</HI> as diametrically oppo&s;ite. In England a publi&s;hed book, approving of, and per&s;uading to, a republican form of government, would be con&s;i|dered not only as highly offen&s;ive, but &s;eriou&s;ly pu|ni&s;hable.</P>
<P>When <HI>our learned and enlightened convention</HI> fram|ed our federal con&s;titution, they certainly con&s;ider|ed an hereditary limited monarchy, as <HI>no republic.</HI> They meant repre&s;entative and elective government, and not hereditary government. In this intention truly, and in no other, the people adopted the con|&s;titution. An oppo&s;ite a&s;&s;ertion would have been <HI>fatal</HI> to the in&s;trument it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030293_0027_0FE5AAAAF47C14B8">
It is &s;incerely and faithfully in the <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> and <HI>elective</HI> &s;en&s;e, that the federal con&s;titution pro|mi&s;es, that it <HI>will</HI> guarantee to every &s;tate in the American union, a <HI>republican form of government.</HI> As no &s;uch act of guarantee has been <HI>yet</HI> con&s;ider|ed or accompli&s;hed, it is of con&s;equence to ob&s;erve, that in the 15th page of the American edition, and in the 22d of the London edition, in the preface to volume I. Mr. Adams expre&s;sly affirms that <Q>a limited monarchy, e&s;pecially when limited by two independent branches, an ari&s;tocratical and a de|mocratical power in the con&s;titution, may, <HI>with &s;trict propriety,</HI> be called by that name," viz. a republic.</Q> Hence it will clearly follow, that if an attempt &s;hould be made, <HI>in future,</HI> to convert the &s;everal &s;tates into <HI>hereditary</HI> governments, with kings and nobles, Mr. Adams would deem &s;uch a mea&s;ure <HI>"&s;trictly, properly, and in truth"</HI> within the meaning of <HI>the terms</HI> of the con&s;titution. In the 34th letter, he exemplifies this general a&s;&s;erti|on, too plainly to be mi&s;under&s;tood, by an exi&s;ting favorite example, for he affirms that <Q>the con&s;ti|tution of England is, <HI>in truth, a republic,</HI> and has ever been &s;o con&s;idered by foreigners, and by the mo&s;t learned and enlightened Engli&s;hmen, al|though the word <HI>commonwealth</HI> has become unpo|pular and odious, &s;ince the un&s;ucce&s;sful and <HI>inju|dicious</HI> attempts to aboli&s;h monarchy and ari&s;to|cracy between the years 1640 and 1660.</Q> (See page 208, London edition.)</P>
<P>Con&s;idering how ingenious, bold, and tenacious the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power often are, we cannot but &s;ee in tho&s;e two kindred and connected a&s;&s;ertions of Mr. Adams, <HI>an ample foundation</HI> for a &s;erious, dan|gerous, and fatal verbal &s;ophi&s;m, by which the high and &s;trong barrier again&s;t hereditary power, con|tained in that part of the con&s;titution, may be got over, without the trouble of breaking it down.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030293_0028_0FE5AA62D0CF11F0">
This thirty-fourth letter merits very particular at|tention. Mr. Adams begins by &s;aying, he had pro|mi&s;ed to &s;tate the ideas of Sir Thomas Smith, con|cerning the mutability of governments. Sir Tho|mas had publi&s;hed, in the remote reign of queen Elizabeth, a book, entitled, " The Commonwealth of England." But after a few lines, which have not the lea&s;t relation to the promi&s;ed &s;tatement of the mutability of governments, Mr. Adams di&s;mi&s;&s;es Smith's work, with the&s;e words; <Q>But as there is nothing remarkable, either in favor of our &s;y&s;tem, or again&s;t it, I &s;hould not have quoted the book in this place, but for the &s;ake of its title.</Q> And Mr. Adams then goes on to &s;ay, <Q>the con&s;titution of England is in truth a republic!</Q> Here we &s;ee Mr. Adams <HI>purpo&s;ely</HI> introduces an author's mere title page, though he mentions that his book has nothing in it of any con&s;equence to his "defence" (<HI>on purpo&s;e,</HI> it mu&s;t be again &s;aid) to have an op|portunity of giving a good name, the name of <HI>re|public,</HI> to his favorite government. Surely Mr. A|dams cannot expect the world to believe, that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is either like ours, becau&s;e it was called <HI>"a commonwealth,"</HI> in the <HI>title</HI> page of an antique book, written two hundred and twenty years before; or, that it is in any degree the bet|ter, <HI>in &s;ub&s;tance,</HI> becau&s;e that name was then given to it; or, that we ought to con&s;ider <HI>as le&s;s,</HI> the im|men&s;e difference between our repre&s;entative govern|ments, and that real and indi&s;putable compound of ari&s;tocracy in two-thirds, and of monarchy in one-third, <HI>unmixed with even a virtual repre&s;entation of the people.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;tatement of the Briti&s;h government is forc|ed upon us by every volume, by the whole &s;cope and &s;pirit of Mr. Adams's work. It was wi&s;hed to avoid the remarks here made, and tho&s;e in the clo&s;e of our la&s;t paper, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice
<PB N="31" REF="030293_0029_0FE5AAAC85F25E90">to this deeply intere&s;ting di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, without treat|ing explicitly of that government, which is erro|neou&s;ly held up as <HI>the great exemplar</HI> for America and mankind, as <Q>the mo&s;t &s;tupendous fabric of human invention</Q>&mdash;as the political <HI>magnum bo|num,</HI> matured by time upon the tree of knowledge.</P>
<P>What then are truly the political functionaries under the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. They are,</P>
<P N="1">I. A king holding, <HI>hereditarily,</HI> the <HI>monarchical</HI> third of the compound, we have mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">II. A hou&s;e of lords holding, <HI>hereditarily,</HI> one of tho&s;e thirds of the compound, which we have called <HI>ari&s;tocratical.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. A hou&s;e of commons, as it is con&s;titution|ally denominated, which is <HI>completely independent of the people in a clear and efficient majority,</HI> and is truly <HI>an ari&s;tocracy of gentry, and of the clients of the lords,</HI> holding its powers on the foundation of landed e&s;tates, which de&s;cend as <HI>hereditarily</HI> to a &s;ingle per&s;on, as the e&s;tates of the lords, or as the crown it&s;elf. There are &s;ome occa&s;ional exceptions, when great and wealthy <HI>purcha&s;ers,</HI> &s;till clearly of the ari|&s;tocratical quality, <HI>buy with coin</HI> the <HI>fee-&s;imple</HI> of a decayed borough, together with <HI>the appurtenant &s;eat</HI> in the hou&s;e of commons, or purcha&s;e, at the elec|tion market-fairs, the votes which are for &s;ale. To &s;uch a number do this kind of members amount, that the large&s;t hou&s;e of commons, which had ever a&s;&s;embled before the American war, was returned from places, the majorities of who&s;e whole number of electors were no more than five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-three, in a kingdom with about eleven millions and an half of inhabitants. If the whole of the voters in tho&s;e places (both the majority and minority) were eleven thou&s;and five hundred per&s;ons, they would only be about the two-hundredth part of the adult males! For a na|tion
<PB N="32" REF="030293_0030_0FE5AAAE5B1F1998">of eleven and an half millions of per&s;ons, con|tains about two millions three hundred thou&s;and <HI>males</HI> of lawful age.</P>
<P>After this review, which is believed to be neither materially incorrect nor uncandid, we may &s;afely affirm, that the hou&s;e of commons is <HI>a true and ab|&s;olute ari&s;tocracy,</HI> principally of <HI>hereditary</HI> wealth, and partly of <HI>pecuniary</HI> riches. Be&s;ides, the ari&s;to|cratic influence of many rich and powerful families, <HI>commands</HI> the &s;eats for &s;ome entire counties, and <HI>di|vides</HI> others.</P>
<P>It re&s;ults, unan&s;werably, as we humbly conceive, that the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons are <HI>not the repre|&s;entatives of the people;</HI> that its powers are wielded by per&s;ons who have <HI>no elective relation to</HI> 199-200th <HI>parts of the freemen of Britain,</HI> but an intere&s;t as <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> and as <HI>oppo&s;ite,</HI> as that of the lords.</P>
<P>Is then <Q>the con&s;titution of England <HI>truly</HI> a re|public?</Q> Is it preferable to ours? Is that con|&s;titution, which is <HI>hereditary</HI> in two branches, and a fluctuating ari&s;tocracy in the third, like ours, which is <HI>repre&s;entative and elective throughout?</HI> If it has pre&s;erved liberty better than the de&s;poti&s;ms of the European continent, are we prepared <HI>to abandon for it our federal con&s;titution?</HI></P>
<P>It is to us the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing of all facts, that becau&s;e the Briti&s;h and Americans have made <HI>three divi&s;ions of power,</HI> we &s;hould be con&s;idered as hav|ing governments of <HI>three orders,</HI> like the king, the noble, and unnobled ari&s;tocracies, which have wre&s;t|ed from the <HI>unrepre&s;ented</HI> people, <HI>the whole govern|ment of Britain.</HI> As well might we repre&s;ent a pe|de&s;tal, re&s;ting upon THREE iron columns, as &s;imi|lar to one &s;upported by THREE non-electric pillars. The whole congeniality depends on the <HI>magical</HI> in|fluence of the mono&s;yllable THREE. In rea&s;on, they are <HI>oppo&s;ites.</HI></P>

<P>THE &s;equel of the thirty-fourth letter of Mr. Adams, remains to be con&s;idered. We have &s;een that in commenting upon certain <HI>republican</HI> &s;en|timents of <HI>Marchamont Nedham,</HI> Mr. Adams did by <HI>no means</HI> &s;eize the occa&s;ion to panegyrize <HI>repre&s;enta|tive</HI> or <HI>elective</HI> government. He &s;ays it <HI>may</HI> an&s;wer very well, but that it is <HI>a hazardous experiment,</HI> that &s;uch experiments have been made before, and are known always to have ended in one way, that is, in monarchy, for that mankind have <HI>"univer&s;ally"</HI> preferred <HI>"chance,"</HI> or hereditary rulers, to &s;uch as they have procured by their pa&s;t elective experi|ments. Thus, in truth, does Mr. Adams throw clouds over our pro&s;pects under elective govern|ments, when di&s;cour&s;ing upon the opinions of <HI>re|publican</HI> theori&s;ts. Thus does he abandon <HI>the defence</HI> of the <HI>cardinal</HI> principle of our con&s;titutions, and thus, under the cover of a defence of <HI>three divi&s;i|ons of power,</HI> does he run into the paths that lead
<PB N="34" REF="030293_0032_0FE5AA5DDAEE6CA8">to the <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> principle of <HI>hereditary dominion.</HI> This is no tortured mi&s;repre&s;entation of the pa&s;&s;ages re|ferred to. We &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves for &s;uch treatment of re&s;pectable men, or of important &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>But how differently does Mr. Adams conduct his di&s;cour&s;es, when he is ob&s;erving upon writers who are not, in the American &s;en&s;e, <HI>republican</HI> authors. He &s;tates the ideas of Polybius and Plato, who both contemplated hereditary power, as parts of their &s;y&s;tems. He gives the preci&s;e conceptions of Poly|bius, in the following deci&s;ive words:&mdash; <Q>It is cu&s;|tomary to e&s;tabli&s;h three &s;orts of governments: <HI>kingly</HI> government, <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> and <HI>democracy:</HI> up|on which one may very properly a&s;k them, whe|ther they lay the&s;e down as the only forms of go|vernment, or, <HI>as the be&s;t;</HI> for in both ca&s;es they &s;eem to be in an error, &s;ince it is manife&s;t, that <HI>the be&s;t form of government is that which is com|pounded of all three.</HI> This is founded, not only <HI>in rea&s;on,</HI> but in experience, Lycurgus having &s;et the example of this form of government, in the in&s;titution of the Lacedemonian common|wealth.</Q> The electors will remember that this Lacedemonian commonwealth was the very &s;ame <HI>mixed monarchy</HI> noticed in the clo&s;e of our fir&s;t paper.</P>
<P>After having thus briefly and preci&s;ely &s;tated the political creed of Polybius, and after giving that of the diffu&s;ive Plato in a more diffu&s;ive manner, Mr. Adams &s;ays, in his thirty-fourth letter, <Q>let us proceed then to make a few ob&s;ervations upon the di&s;cour&s;es of Plato and Polybius.</Q> "Plato," &s;ays Mr. Adams (page 209, Philadelphia and Lon|don editions) <Q>has &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;erted the honor of the laws, and the nece&s;&s;ity of proper guardians of them; but has no where delineated the vari|ous <HI>orders</HI> of guardians, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a
<PB N="35" REF="030293_0033_0FE5AA1087A273D8">balance between them: he has, neverthele&s;s, giv|en us premi&s;es, from whence <HI>the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch orders</HI> and equipoi&s;es may be inferred; he has &s;hewn how naturally every &s;imple &s;pecies of government degenerates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This nobody in America now doubts, and there was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Penn&s;ylvania, in 1778, a &s;ociety to overturn its fir&s;t con&s;titution, on account of <HI>the unity</HI> of the legi&s;lature.</NOTE> The ari&s;tocracy, or ambitious republic, becomes immediately an oligarchy&mdash;what &s;hall be done to prevent it? Place two guardians of the law to watch the ari&s;|tocracy; one, in the &s;hape of a <HI>king</HI> [not a chief magi&s;trate like our pre&s;ident] on one &s;ide of it; another, in the &s;hape of a democratical a&s;&s;embly, on the other &s;ide. The ari&s;tocracy, become an oligarchy, changes into a democracy&mdash;how &s;hall it be prevented? By giving <HI>the natural ari&s;tocra|cy,</HI> in &s;ociety, its rational and ju&s;t weight, and by giving it a <HI>regal</HI> power to appeal to, again&s;t <HI>the madne&s;s of the people.</HI> Democracy becomes a tyranny&mdash;how &s;hall this be prevented? By giv|ing it an able independent <HI>ally</HI> in an <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> a&s;&s;embly, with whom it may unite again&s;t the unju&s;t and illegal de&s;igns of any one man.</Q></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee that Mr. Adams, having got a <HI>royal</HI> theme to di&s;cour&s;e upon, does not run into doubts and prophecies about <HI>hereditary</HI> governments, as he had before done in regard to our <HI>elective</HI> govern|ments. The&s;e royal governments <HI>mu&s;t</HI> then appear to him <HI>free from all cau&s;e of doubt.</HI> He does not throw out the &s;malle&s;t caution or alarm again&s;t them. But indeed he takes pains to &s;hew, that the <HI>regal</HI> and <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> powers are proper and nece&s;|&s;ary checks upon what he calls the madne&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Let us a&s;k our&s;elves, however, where and when &s;uch a government has been exhibited. Where
<PB N="36" REF="030293_0034_0FE5AA12177C0238">and when were <HI>a king</HI> and <HI>nobles,</HI> each having a ne|gative on the laws, combined with a <HI>real</HI> repre&s;en|tation of the people? No where, we affirm, but <HI>in books.</HI> How then can it be thus <HI>decidedly</HI> a&s;&s;erted, from unexecuted theories, that the three would work &s;o well together, as our excellent government <HI>has</HI> done? For a new government, organized <HI>in a &s;torm,</HI> in a country <HI>half wilderne&s;s,</HI> placed over <HI>a various people,</HI> in a time of <HI>unexampled and extreme</HI> difficulties, amid&s;t a <HI>belligerent</HI> and <HI>infuriated</HI> world, having to &s;truggle with <HI>the arrearages of many years,</HI> embarra&s;&s;ed by <HI>di&s;putes with two</HI> neighbouring pow|ers, and by <HI>Indian wars,</HI> to carry us through, with &s;afety and <HI>pro&s;perity,</HI> is <HI>more</HI> than any <HI>mixed monar|chy ever</HI> accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Let it be here well remembered, that ours is <HI>the fir&s;t genuine repre&s;entative government</HI> the world had &s;een in 1789. Human affairs do not appear to ad|mit of more &s;ucce&s;s and advantages under any form of government, even in the calme&s;t times.

The&s;e papers have been generally and publicly a&s;cribed to Mr. Adams, who re&s;ided, dur|ing the time of their publication, at the &s;eat of go|vernment, where they were addre&s;&s;ed to the Ame|rican nation.</P>
<P>In the fourth number of he "Di&s;cour&s;es upon Davila," the writer treats of Mr. Adams's favorite topic, <HI>"Di&s;tinctions in civil Society."</HI> He fir&s;t pro|po&s;es &s;ome que&s;tions, as from an opponent to or|ders and di&s;tinctions, in the following words: [Di&s;cour&s;e IV.]</P>
<P>"Is there any thing in birth" <HI>(&s;ays &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed republican)</HI> <Q>however illu&s;trious or &s;plendid, which &s;hould make a difference between one man and another? If, from a common ance&s;tor, the whole human race is de&s;cended, they are all of the &s;ame family. How then can they di&s;tingui&s;h families into the more or the le&s;s ancient? What advan|tage is there in an illu&s;tration of an hundred or
<PB N="38" REF="030293_0036_0FE5AAB79D1D6268">thou&s;and years? Of what avail are all the hi&s;to|ries, pedigrees, traditions, &amp;c.? But this advan|tage mu&s;t be derived from his father and mother chiefly, if not wholly. Of what importance is it then, in this view, whether the family is twen|ty generations upon record, or only two?</Q> To the&s;e que&s;tions from the opponent to hereditary di&s;|tinctions and orders, the writer gives, <HI>as from him|&s;elf,</HI> this reply:</P>
<P><Q>The mighty &s;ecret lies in this.&mdash;An illu&s;tri|ous de&s;cent attracts the notice of mankind.

Becau&s;e, although it excites <HI>the indignation</HI> of <HI>many,</HI> and the envy of more, <HI>it &s;till attracts the attention of the world.</HI></Q> Thus does the writer of the Di&s;cour&s;es upon Davila view even the unlawful "&s;catterings" of royal loins.&mdash;How in|congenial are the&s;e &s;entiments, with the &s;pirit of our <HI>defended</HI> con&s;titutions? Again&mdash;The author of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es next repre&s;ents the manner, in which various nations, have &s;everally e&s;tabli&s;hed royalty, nobility, orders, and di&s;tinctions, and then &s;ays&mdash; <Q><HI>Other nations have united all tho&s;e in&s;tituti|ons</HI> [or modes of <HI>royalizing</HI> and <HI>ennobling:</HI>] con|nected <HI>lands, offices,</HI> and <HI>families</HI>&mdash;made them <HI>all de&s;cend together,</HI> and <HI>honor, public attention, con&s;i|deration,</HI> and <HI>congratulation along with them.</HI> This has been the policy of <HI>Europe:</HI></Q> and, &s;ays our au|thor, <HI>fully explaining him&s;elf,</HI> <Q><HI>it is to this in&s;titution which &s;he [Europe] owes her &s;uperiority, in war and peace, in legi&s;lation and commerce, in agricul|ture, navigation, arts, &s;ciences, and manufactures, to A&s;ia and Africa.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Re&s;pectable electors, we entreat you to read once more this bold and explicit a&s;&s;ertion of the writer of the Di&s;cour&s;es. To what does it amount? No le&s;s, than that the <HI>hereditary union and de&s;cent</HI> of

<P>The twelfth number of the Di&s;cour&s;es upon <HI>Da|vila,</HI> contains but a dozen lines of pro&s;e. The re&s;t is made up of poetical extracts from one whom the writer compliments, as "<HI>the</HI> Great Ma&s;ter of Na|ture," and as "a great teacher of morality and politics."</P>

Our author in the fourteenth Di&s;cour&s;e reiterates <HI>to France,</HI> who had begun her revolution, what Mr. Adams had &s;aid to Europe in general, when he ad|vi&s;ed them only to aim at one branch, deriving its power from the people, and to pre&s;erve their kings and nobles.

<P>IT has been remarked by &s;ome, that Mr. Adams's book was written in 1786, or 1787, and there|fore that he could not mean to object to our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> con&s;titution. It is true that the preface of the fir&s;t volume is dated in January 1787, but it is a fact that the third volume was publi&s;hed <HI>after</HI> he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the federal con&s;titution, which is an|nexed to that volume; and that it contains, as we have &s;hewn, &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages, which are mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to that in&s;trument in principle. The Di&s;|cour&s;es upon Davila, too, are the mo&s;t forcible cor|roborations of this oppo&s;ition, and upon the &s;trong
<PB N="43" REF="030293_0041_0FE5AA1D2043C018">pre&s;umption, that they are the work of Mr. A|dams, they amount to <HI>an active unfriendline&s;s</HI> to the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>cardinal</HI> principle of all our con&s;titu|tions, both of the &s;tates and of the union. They tend, at this time to invite the interpo&s;ition of the foreign monarchies in our affairs, however different were certainly the views, with which they were written.</P>
<P>It has been al&s;o ob&s;erved that Mr. Adams's book was written before his two elections, and yet that the people had confided in him as vice-pre&s;ident. It is, however, true, that the third volume, being pub|li&s;hed in London in 1788, could not be for &s;ale in the American book-&s;tores before the mea&s;ures were taken for the fir&s;t election. But what is much more important, and is ab&s;olutely true, the books were not <HI>read,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>&s;tudied</HI> in America; for books in|tended to di&s;play great hi&s;torical events and relating to the principles of government, are not to be pe|ru&s;ed, like a &s;ummer's tale&mdash;an amu&s;ing fable for an Augu&s;t day. By the writer of the&s;e papers the &s;econd and third volumes had never been &s;een, ex|cept &s;o far as their out&s;ides in the library of &s;ome other per&s;on. And though the fir&s;t volume had been actually purcha&s;ed, from &s;entiments of re&s;pect to Mr. Adams's character and &s;tation, it is a truth, that other vocations and other books had occa&s;ion|ed it never to be either &s;tudied or peru&s;ed. Its con|tents and principles were not known till within a year or two la&s;t pa&s;t, when <HI>other</HI> circum&s;tances, <HI>of the nature of the book,</HI> rendered Mr. Adams's work an object of attention to many. Phocion &s;ays he has &s;een much of America and its inhabitants, and that he has never heard a wi&s;h for any other form of government than a republic. The &s;pecimens he has given of re-&s;tatements, even of the <HI>written</HI> opi|nions and de&s;ires of others, cannot in&s;pire the elec|tors with confidence in his accuracy, in regard to
<PB N="44" REF="030293_0042_0FE5AA740E7DBF50">what may have been orally delivered before him. He too, like Mr. Adams, may con&s;ider a limited monarchy as properly a republic, and he may deem a wi&s;h for a con&s;titution like that of Great Britain, to be only a de&s;ire of having another "form" of a re|public, which Mr. Adams unequivocally a&s;&s;erts the con&s;titution of England <HI>in truth</HI> to be. It is our un&s;haken opinion, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank of the United States was very much to be de|&s;ired&mdash; that neither this nor any other civilized na|tion can avoid the u&s;e of the exci&s;e mode of revenue, &s;ooner or later&mdash;that <HI>the funding</HI> of public debts, which cannot be paid off when due, is as much a matter of &s;imple <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> of <HI>prudence,</HI> and of <HI>natural</HI> cour&s;e, as the giving of a common bond and &s;ecur|ing it by mortgage, for a private debt&mdash;that the check given to Mr. Genet, by the executive, was perfectly ju&s;tifiable and nece&s;&s;ary, and, in &s;hort, that many acts for which this government has been blamed, were &s;ubjects of <HI>merited</HI> approbation. But with the&s;e &s;entiments, it is a &s;olemn truth, that we have felt &s;erious anxieties at the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> and <HI>growth</HI> of the anti-con&s;titutional doctrine of <HI>hereditary</HI> pow|er, <HI>which we have actually perceived.</HI> We have been explicit, in regard to this &s;ubject, on account of the declaration of Phocion, that he has heard no wi&s;hes for any but republican government&mdash;We <HI>know</HI> them to exi&s;t, and we wi&s;h it were only in common minds, and in per&s;ons of little influence. It is <HI>the true cau&s;e</HI> of the pre&s;ent re&s;pectful addre&s;s to the under&s;tandings and patrioti&s;m of the electors.</P>
<P>It is particulary nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that there have been <HI>&s;everal</HI> partial and general editions of Mr. Adams's work. The fir&s;t volume was publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, by Hall and Sellers, and the whole three volumes were printed in London. Other edi|tions have been printed, it is believed in the Ea&s;tern &s;tates. The &s;ize of the paper, types, and paging, have
<PB N="45" REF="030293_0043_0FE5AA75DFE9D490">differed more or le&s;s. The preface in the Philadel|phia duodecimo copy, occupies &s;eventeen pages, but in the London edition it covers twenty-&s;ix pages.&mdash; Sometimes it appears, that the preface is meant to be referred to by writers in the gazettes, when, how|ever, they expre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o, that the reader &s;up|po&s;es it is the main body of the work. No volume is numbered on the back, as <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e, when the fir&s;t volume was publi&s;hed in Europe and in A|merica, it is manife&s;t that the author delivered it to the world as an entire work, without any intima|tion of publi&s;hing a &s;econd and third volume. The main body of the work, in this fir&s;t volume, is con|tained in a little more than 389 pages in the Phi|ladelphia copy, and occupies 392 pages in the Lon|don edition. The&s;e remarks upon the different <HI>edi|tions</HI> and <HI>pagings,</HI> and upon the <HI>preface</HI> and <HI>the main work,</HI> are recommended to particular attention, be|cau&s;e they will obviate &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction which has been excited by the idea of de&s;igned mi&s;quotations. Two examples will be given. Time does not admit of &s;tating more. A writer from Henrico, in Virgi|nia, animadverts with feeling, upon &s;ome opponent of Mr. Adams, for quoting a pa&s;&s;age, as from the 8th page of his work, and &s;ays, he has read that page, and can find no &s;uch &s;entence in it, as was given by the writer he is oppo&s;ing. Now it is found, on examination, that the pa&s;&s;age referred to is, &s;ub&s;tantially, in the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> page of Hall and Sellers's Philadelphia edition, and in the <HI>ninth</HI> page of the London edition. It is not in the eighth page of either of tho&s;e editions, &s;o that the quoter mu&s;t have had another copy. But further, it is in <HI>the preface,</HI> and not in <HI>the main body</HI> of the work. The pa&s;&s;age is material, and is fairly given to the world as Mr. Adams wrote it.&mdash;That gentleman had men|tioned <HI>"monarchy"</HI> in the clo&s;e of the preceding paragraph, and then gave the following words, ex|cept the word monarchy, which is now put into a
<PB N="46" REF="030293_0044_0FE5AA1EB56EB218">parenthe&s;is, and not in Italics, for the &s;ake of &s;trict accuracy.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q><HI>The objection to the&s;e governments</HI> (monarchy) <HI>is not becau&s;e they are &s;upported by nobles and a &s;u|bordination of ranks: for all governments, even the mo&s;t democratical, are &s;upported by a &s;ubordination of offices, and ranks too.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So, again, in the 22d page of the London <HI>pre|face,</HI> and in the 15th of the preface of Hall and Sellers's edition, it is &s;aid, that <HI>a limited monarchy</HI> may, with &s;trict propriety, be called <HI>a republic.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations and examples will be &s;ufficient to explain this <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> point.</P>

<P>COLLATERAL circum&s;tances are often pow|erful corroboratives of direct evidence. It is therefore of con&s;equence to &s;tate, that an accident has recently brought under view a pa&s;&s;age in one of the papers, written with every apparent exertion again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in 1792, ju&s;t before the la&s;t election of a pre&s;ident, when it was uncertain whe|ther <HI>General Wa&s;hington</HI> would &s;erve again. The writer, though an explicit and indu&s;trious opponent of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, admits that Mr. Adams entertains what he <HI>ingeniou&s;ly</HI> calls <Q><HI>&s;peculative</HI> doubts con|cerning the probable &s;ucce&s;s of the republican theory.</Q><HI>Practical</HI> politicians always aim to <HI>real|ize</HI> their mental <HI>&s;peculations.</HI> That paper was the fir&s;t of a &s;eries of e&s;&s;ays, publi&s;hed under the &s;igna|ture
<PB N="47" REF="030293_0045_0FE5AA776DFFB9F0">of <HI>Catullus,</HI> in the Gazette of the United States. Who was the writer of Catullus, does not appear, but it is certain that the letters of Phocion (&s;ince publi&s;hed in a pamphlet, October, 1796, without that &s;ignature) contain entire pa&s;&s;ages of the e&s;&s;ays of Catullus, <HI>without the u&s;ual inverted commas</HI> ["] or <HI>any other marks of quotation.</HI> The pre&s;umption, that Phocion and Catullus are the &s;ame per&s;on or per&s;ons, appears to be perfectly fair and irre&s;i&s;tible. &mdash;There is no e&s;&s;ential difference (except on a point we &s;hall mention) between the entire contents of Catullus, and an <HI>equal quantity</HI> of the e&s;&s;ays of Pho|cion. Matters, &s;ub&s;equent to the publications of Catullus, are found, it is true, in Phocion and in the pamphlet made up of what was fir&s;t given in the gazettes, under that &s;ignature. They contra|dict each other <HI>only</HI> as to Mr. Adams. Catullus admits that Mr. Adams may doubt the probable &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>republican</HI> theory. Phocion and the pamphlet <HI>declaim</HI> a little about Mr. Adams's repub|licani&s;m, and then quote a few pa&s;&s;ages, which on|ly tend to render his books &s;omething le&s;s impru|dent, but &s;o far as they go, al&s;o render them ab&s;o|lutely and palpably <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent.</HI> But the e&s;&s;ays of Pho|cion (and the revi&s;ed pamphlet-copy of part of his e&s;&s;ays) do not explain away any of the hereditary pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Adams's books, nor do they an&s;wer the &s;erious matters from tho&s;e books, and from the Di&s;cour&s;es on Davila, which have been re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to you.

We could al&s;o greatly reinforce the numerous evidences, po&s;itive and pre&s;umptive, by which we have &s;upported our a&s;&s;ertion, that Mr. Adams really cheri&s;hes expectations, hopes, and de|&s;ires for <HI>hereditary</HI> power in the United States, con|trary to <HI>the de&s;ign</HI> and to the <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> of our fede|ral con&s;titution, contrary to <HI>the earne&s;t wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>fixed determination</HI> of the American people, and con|trary to their <HI>internal peace,</HI> their <HI>true intere&s;ts,</HI> and their <HI>equal birth-rights.</HI></P>
<P>To elect as <HI>the repre&s;entative pre&s;ident</HI> of the Uni|ted States, a citizen of &s;uch political opinions, how|ever meritorious in other re&s;pects, appears to us to be alarmingly fraught with <HI>numerous</HI> inconveniences, and <HI>tremendous</HI> evils. <HI>Con&s;cientious convictions</HI> of the inevitable production of tho&s;e <HI>di&s;tracting</HI> evils, <HI>the re&s;ult of deliberate ob&s;ervation and reflexion,</HI> have been the real impul&s;es to this publication. It is re&s;pect|fully &s;ubmitted to the electors and to their deeply in-intere&s;ted con&s;tituents throughout the union.</P>
