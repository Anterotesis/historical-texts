<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;ociation,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TOday you commemorate the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of your Society. This anniver|&s;ary di&s;covers the importance of your in&s;titution. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, we behold, not only the Members of your A&s;&s;ociation, every department of the community &s;eems to croud about you, and lau|dably emulate your zeal for improving the arts of our country. The ancients, our forefathers, and we our&s;elves, have, by national fe&s;tivals, ever delighted to &s;olemnize the events of war; becau&s;e tho&s;e events terminated ho&s;tilities, e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;overeignty of empires, and in a manner &s;ecured the enjoyment of all the tranquility of peace. With &s;ingular propri|ety, then, do your fellow-citizens unite with you, in the ceremonial of in&s;titutions, which cannot ex|i&s;t, unle&s;s under the au&s;pices of peace, the offspring of tho&s;e mighty events. If, at &s;uch times, our an|nual rejoicings have been great, becau&s;e tho&s;e events were glorious, our celebration of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments will be had with &s;till greater joy, becau&s;e they are more u&s;eful; for even deeds of glory cea&s;e to be in|tere&s;ting, when they no longer have utility; and the effulgence of victory her&s;elf lo&s;es the power to ex|cite admiration, when once &s;he becomes de&s;tructive. The arts of peace, therefore, to which all other things
<PB N="4" REF="037067_0004_100C43192EC7EBF0">
are but &s;ub&s;ervient, will forever remain mo&s;t impor|tant, becau&s;e they will forever remain mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ideration greatly heightens the embar|ra&s;&s;ment of one who could never without trembling publicly &s;peak on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ion. On the &s;ubject before us, what can he &s;ay? Every thing has been anticipated by the philo&s;ophizing &s;agacity of a Burrill, the dazzling imagination of a Maxcy, and the all-exhau&s;ting copiou&s;ne&s;s of a Wil&s;on. I feel the pre&s;umption of my attempt; and nothing could have induced the undertaking, but a mo&s;t ar|dent wi&s;h to comply with the reque&s;t of that order of the community, to which the fir&s;t habits of my life united me. Altho' for this ta&s;k very little quali|fied by nature, and &s;till le&s;s by the di&s;cipline of ear|ly in&s;truction; altho' the duration of his re&s;idence a|mong you &s;carcely entitles him to the indulgence of an acquaintance, while the pecuniary circum&s;tances of his life have hitherto excluded him from the ho|nors of citizen&s;hip; yet, Gentlemen, his appearing in this place, before you, and at your appointment, communicates to the Orator of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, a mo&s;t undoubting a&s;&s;urance of your patronizing candour, together with the liberal and polite atten|tion of all that numerous, and brilliant concour&s;e of citizens, which &s;eems to croud every part of this au|gu&s;t temple.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, you a&s;&s;ociated for &s;pecifick purpo|&s;es. The&s;e mu&s;t have been the advancement of the mechanic intere&s;t, together with the general benefit of the commonwealth. Skill in your Arts and Man|ufactures, economy in the di&s;tribution of your be|nevolence, and a viligant attention to the intere&s;ts of your order, as they &s;tand related to the great com|munity, doubtle&s;s con&s;tituted the mo&s;t con&s;iderable objects of your in&s;titution. The means of forward|ing the&s;e intentions, and the importance of tho&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="037067_0005_100C431BB5ACA960">
objects which your union was formed to &s;ecure lay before us materials for long di&s;cour&s;e. Among the&s;e, you will &s;ay, with me, that your anniver&s;ary Orator ought ever to find his theme. If I may be permitted to tell how your de&s;igns might be advan|ced, I would fir&s;t &s;olicit your attention to the im|provement of your arts; and then &s;ay a few things concerning their importance. On the&s;e arts, how|ever, I would not be thought to offer a word by way of in&s;truction; for altho' the hand of my youth was hardened by the toil of a mo&s;t laborious trade, yet whatever I can advance on the&s;e &s;ubjects, mu&s;t be perfectly known to men, who have wiped from their brow the &s;weat of mechanic labor through the heat of fifty &s;ummers.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;eems to me to comprehend more of the means of your improvement, than your a&s;&s;oci|ated, and individual independence. Dependence, it is true, is the principle of union throughout mate|rial and moral nature; but, it is al&s;o true, that inde|pendence is the principle of individuality. It is this which makes each being what it is, and pre&s;erves it in the exerci&s;e of its con&s;tituted nature. There is, through all the univer&s;e, a principle by which each particular being appropriates whatever it acquires to the perpetuation of its own individual exi&s;tence.&mdash; This is but the principle of independence. Under various names we every where behold it. In the in|animate world, it is called attraction; in plants, ve|getation; in&s;tinct, in mere animals; rea&s;on in man; and independence in political a&s;&s;ociations. De&s;troy this appropriating principle of independence, and nations would di&s;&s;olve into unconnected wanderers; men would cea&s;e to regard each other, becau&s;e they would not feel intere&s;ted in them&s;elves; brutes might wallow in the brook or trample on the green herbage, but they would never make an effort to quench their thir&s;t, or &s;atisfy their hunger; the ver|dure
<PB N="6" REF="037067_0006_100C43205DAC15A8">
of &s;pring never more could cloth the valley; the rock on which we &s;tep would pulverize beneath our foot, and the earth it&s;elf crumble into atoms too &s;mall for divi&s;ibility.</P>
<P>THOSE beings are mo&s;t perfect in their kind, mo&s;t completely &s;ub&s;erve the de&s;ign of their creation, in which this principle is found mo&s;t uninterrupted in its operations. In the inanimate world, it is not often di&s;turbed, and we, therefore, &s;ee, that part of the univer&s;e, unvaryingly &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of animated, rea&s;onable and &s;ocial exi&s;tence, the great and only de&s;ign of its creation. In plants, this prin|ciple is almo&s;t as &s;teady. They vegetate, with near|ly the &s;ame certainty, that rain de&s;cends from the clouds, or rivers roll away from their &s;ources. Ani|mals follow their hone&s;t in&s;tincts, and travel round the circle of their exi&s;tence ju&s;t as certainly as &s;pring renews the green foliage of the oak. In man, this principle is violated. We &s;ee him, often ra&s;h, or weak, and undecided. It is becau&s;e he &s;uffers his rea&s;on, the director of his actions, the principle of his independence, the guardian of his individuality, to remain unin&s;tructed by knowledge, not &s;trength|ened by frequent di&s;cipline, and often bia&s;ed by pa&s;|&s;ions. Such a rea&s;on will, one moment, make a thou&s;and re&s;olves, and &s;upercede them, by a thou&s;and contrary re&s;olutions the next; and finally, when it determines to action, that determination is as pro|bably the will of another, as that of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.&mdash; Actions, originating from &s;uch a will, and &s;uch a rea|&s;on, are puny and feeble, like their parents; they de|prave human nature, and dimini&s;h individuality by increa&s;ing dependence. It is an informed, &s;trong, and unbia&s;ed rea&s;on, which gives energy to his will, and moves a man forward in the orbit of his nature, like the Sun travelling thro' the fields of heaven.&mdash; Such men are &s;ufficient for whatever God de&s;igned them. They are fraught with exhau&s;tle&s;s re&s;ources,
<PB N="7" REF="037067_0007_100C4322AF05EB08">
and &s;eem almo&s;t &s;elf-&s;ub&s;i&s;tent. Men of the oppo|&s;ite character are &s;wallowed up in the common ma&s;s of animated things; and if deprived of &s;hapes and names they would not retain one characteri&s;teric of individuality.</P>
<P>IN political bodies, this principle is &s;till more fre|quently violated. That &s;pirit of independence, which &s;upports their exi&s;tence, and ought to direct all their actions, like the rea&s;on of an individual, of|ten becomes weak, unenlightened, and liable to in|fluence in a thou&s;and ways. Every &s;ociety, like every man, too ignorant, too weak, too pu&s;ilanimous, or, in one word, too dependent, to direct its own ac|tions, will forever find the intriguing, or the pow|erful, ready to a&s;&s;ume the direction of them. As this dependence increa&s;es, their individuality fades away, until nothing of it remains but the name of their incorporation. It is this huge Leviathan of dependence, &s;tretched on the political ocean, which &s;wallows up even &s;tates and empires.</P>
<P>When once a corporation has lo&s;t its indepen|dence, when once its exi&s;tence has become merely nominal, the de&s;igns of its in&s;titution, whatever they may have been, mu&s;t be entirely lo&s;t. Let the im|provement of home manufactures be the de&s;ign of an a&s;&s;ociation, would this improvement be made if this a&s;&s;ociation were totally dependant on a collec|tion of men, united to encrea&s;e the importation of foreign manufactures? If it were formed to encour|rage benevolence, would it not be de&s;troyed by a dependance on an in&s;titution to promote par&s;imony? &mdash;If it were in&s;tituted to advance religion, or mo|rals, or arts, or &s;cience, when once its re&s;olves, and its actions, were governed by a &s;ociety on which it was entirely dependant, and the object of who&s;e in|&s;titution was entirely different from its own, would
<PB N="8" REF="037067_0008_100C4326461F0058">
not the de&s;ign of its union be lo&s;t in that dependance which thus almo&s;t annihilates its exi&s;tence? Let it, therefore, Gentlemen, be remembered that nothing can &s;ecure, nothing can forward, the de&s;ign of your A&s;&s;ociation, when once its independence has depart|ed from it.</P>
<P>THIS independence of corporation, implies the in|dependence of all tho&s;e individuals who compo&s;e it. It will not be po&s;&s;ible to form an independent A&s;&s;o|ciation from individuals who have any other depen|dencies than mutual ones. If each citizen of the U|nited States lived, and had no other means of living, but by a pen&s;ion from the King of Great Britain, where &s;hould we find the independence of the Fed|eral Government? If therefore, Gentlemen, your A&s;&s;ociation be independent, every member of it will be independent.</P>
<P>THIS independence is a condition below the di&s;&s;i|pation of wealth, and above the &s;olicitude of nece&s;&s;i|ty; it is as far removed from the hurry of want, as from the lazine&s;s of opulence; it is the parent of lei&s;ure, of that lei&s;ure which ever a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with con&s;tant pur&s;uit, and regular employment.&mdash; Let us, Gentlemen, enquire how this independence can forward any of the de&s;igns of your A&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>MEN in this condition, with too much of bu&s;i|ne&s;s ever to be idle, and too far removed from want, ever to be hurried in the performance of their labor, will not only fini&s;h their work with accuracy and &s;kill, they will al&s;o lay the perfecting hand of im|provement on that art which employs their attention. But the man, who is dependant, who is driven on in the performance of his ta&s;k by the commands of penurious nece&s;&s;ity, will never have time to give his work a perfect fini&s;hing. His productions will be the half formed re&s;ult of hurried application; &s;carred
<PB N="9" REF="037067_0009_100C4327CBA47030">
by the rapidity of a ha&s;ty hand; and among a mul|tiplicity of them you will &s;earch in vain to find a piece completed by the fini&s;hing touches of an ar|ti&s;t. For tho' want has been the ever teeming pa|rent of inventions; yet, like the indigent and wi|dowed mother of a numerou&s;ly multiplied progeny of orphans, this prolifick parent of inventions has al|ways been compelled to leave them, unnurtured, without culture, and rude as when they fir&s;t received their exi&s;tence. One mechanic of independence will give more perfection to an art, than a ho&s;t of "lean unwa&s;hed artificers," who, driven on by penurious dependence "to their daily labours add the night."</P>
<P>IN all arts there is a &s;cience, a &s;y&s;tem of elementa|ry rules, or fir&s;t principles, which may properly be denominated their philo&s;ophy. It is the theory of the art; that part of it which &s;tands oppo&s;ed to prac|ti&s;e; that which exi&s;ts in the mind, not that which employs the hand. Theory teaches the arti&s;t what to do; practice guides him in the performance. The complete arti&s;t has, not only accu&s;tomed his hand to all the curiou&s;ly difficult operations of his trade; but he has al&s;o made him&s;elf perfectly ma&s;ter of all its whole &s;y&s;tem of &s;cientifick principles, and is en|tirely a philo&s;opher in his own profe&s;&s;ion. He goes &s;till further, and examines all that world of things which lies immediately &s;urrounding his daily em|ployment. Nor is this applicable to the le&s;s toil|&s;ome trades only. Even the rough &s;on of Mulcer|ber has &s;een the &s;teel redden in the fire, and expand beneath the hammer; but this is not all. He has learned their philo&s;ophy. He knows the power of the &s;ubtle, active, all &s;oftening, all-di&s;&s;ipating ele|ment; and, in a thou&s;and ways, can call "this fla|ming mini&s;ter" to aid his hand, and with a philo|&s;ophick &s;kill in&s;truct is whither to direct its blazing energies.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037067_0010_100C432A24B6BA38">THE man who operates on principle, who u|nites theory and practice, who has perfected phi|lo&s;ophy by experiment, and become more &s;kilful in experiment, by the aid of philo&s;ophy, this man in his own trade is more &s;age than Newton, more powerful than Franklin, and will produce, whatever of perfection, his art can produce. But before he can do this, he mu&s;t have rendered him&s;elf indepen|dent. Little indeed can he philo&s;ophize, who mu&s;t &s;tand at the whi&s;tle of a thou&s;and dependencies; who &s;uffers his mind to feel the whirl of an eternal rota|tion of wants. Independence alone gives time for thought, and be&s;tows that lei&s;ure in which we can indulge curio&s;ity, and pur&s;ue inve&s;tigation. If there|fore, Gentlemen, you would perfect your&s;elves as ar|ti&s;ts, you mu&s;t &s;ecure to your&s;elves independence.</P>
<P>SKILL in art, is the effect of a habit, which, like all other habits, grows from a repetition of preci&s;ely the &s;ame performance. The foot becomes habitua|ted to a frequent trodden path, and we pa&s;s over it with &s;uch facility that the di&s;tance &s;eems &s;hortened. A man writes his name better than any other word, becau&s;e he is mo&s;t habituated to writing it. One con&s;tant, unvaried, and frequent operation, grows into a habit; and that habit gives the hand of the artificer the ea&s;y, rapid, and dexterous movement, which is denominated &s;kill. To perfect &s;kill, there|fore, the operations of the hand &s;hould be as little varied as po&s;&s;ible. For when we for&s;ake one ope|ration for another, we inevitably lo&s;e &s;kill in that from which we departed; becau&s;e, time obliterates every thing, and tho&s;e habits which cu&s;tom has im|pre&s;&s;ed on our &s;y&s;tem are worn away by time.&mdash; What we acquire in youth, unle&s;s retained by con|&s;tant practice, will e&s;cape from us in age. The mind mu&s;t lo&s;e its ideas, the "right hand its cun|ning." He then who would perfect his &s;kill, mu&s;t con&s;tantly apply to one trade.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037067_0011_100C432C787F5D18">IT is an ob&s;ervation, not le&s;s true, than ancient, that he, who applies to a multiplicity of trades, will be &s;killful at none of them. If he be, at one time, a &s;hipwright, at another, a carpenter, then a &s;mith, a taylor, or a &s;hoemaker, we &s;hould wonder indeed if he were not a bungler at all his trades. I have &s;een men who were &s;ometimes, farmers, and, &s;ometimes, artificers; the con&s;equence was, their lands were wretchedly cultivated, and all their work but half fini&s;hed. They might have been &s;kilful hu&s;band|men, or &s;kilful artificers, had they applied to one of the&s;e occupations only, but, perpetually exchanging, they could not excel in either. Let, therefore, the &s;mith remain a &s;mith, the carpenter, a carpenter; and each particular artificer uninterruptedly pur&s;ue the trade to which from infancy he has accu&s;tomed his hand; for in this way only can he cheri&s;h the young habits of his nature, and complete all his pro|ductions with dexterity, and &s;kill.</P>
<P>THIS can &s;eldom be performed, in our country, by the &s;ons of dependence. Nothing, like unfeeling nece&s;&s;ity, drives a man round the toil&s;ome circuit of all the trades. A want of employment, at one, hur|ries him into another; and, the &s;ame day, you may &s;ee him &s;weating over the ax, driving the &s;aw, or &s;moking at the anvil. Independence only will &s;ave him from the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes. The independent man will not be hurried in any one employment, nor ob|liged to pur&s;ue many at the &s;ame time. He there|fore can fix all his attention to one kind of opera|tion, and give every piece of his workman&s;hip a perfect fini&s;hing.</P>
<P>I KNOW it may be &s;aid, that &s;uch a divi&s;ion of labour, as will confine each man to one employment, is the effect of the populou&s;ne&s;s and luxury of a country, not of the independence of its artificers.&mdash; It is true, the wealthy cities of Europe and A&s;ia, o|pen
<PB N="12" REF="037067_0012_100C432F8B4F9D58">
a market for every production of art. It is true, artificers in tho&s;e cities &s;eldom know the &s;weets of independence. They are the poor, pitiful, hirelings of the wealthy, and the powerful; or the abject &s;laves of their own wants and extravagancies. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity alone urges them to ply the hand; and a &s;o|licitude to plea&s;e their proud patrons, and ornament their pageantry, drives them to fini&s;h their work with anxious attention. With them the completion of the artificer is the perfect degradation of the man. They are not only &s;ervile, but ignorant. In London, where the meagre forms of men are for life confined to pointing needles, or heading pins, we &s;hall find them indeed &s;kilful in the&s;e occupations, but &s;tupid beyond all conception, and ignorant of every thing except the mere mechanic ta&s;k which daily employs their hands. Their minds are contracted to the narrow dimen&s;ions of their labour; the little trade engro&s;&s;es all the little man; and he has quite as much claim to rationality, as the little tools with which he performs his work.</P>
<P>SURELY our Country would not improve arts and manufactures at &s;uch expence. If, for every fini&s;hed artificer, a citizen mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, the gain will be far &s;hort of the lo&s;s; and it were better to remain &s;atisfied with the rude productions of un|practi&s;ed hands, than to degrade a large and intelligent part of the community into pieces of mere mechani&s;m. Con&s;ider, Gentlemen, the amazing difference be|tween our country, and tho&s;e which have been pop|ulated almo&s;t ever &s;ince the birth of creation. We have not, and long may we be de&s;titute of, the cau&s;es to perfect arts and manufactures, which have gi|ven them perfection in the luxurious regions of Eu|rope and A&s;ia. Here they mu&s;t owe their improve|ment to the independence of their votaries; to that independence which, while it gives power to confine their hands to the exerci&s;e of one art only, leaves their
<PB N="13" REF="037067_0013_100C4331D614B9A8">
minds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lei&s;ure amply &s;ufficient to &s;tudy the principles, the philo&s;ophy of their own profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IF independence be of &s;o much importance in the improvements of arts, does it not become a part of our &s;ubject? Will it not be proper for a moment to turn our attention to the means of acquiring it? E|very man may be independent; every man who can &s;o controul his own wants, that he will have need of nothing which he has not already obtained, or which it is in the power of any one to withhold from him. Dependence does not inevitably grow out of a multiplicity of wants; nor independence flouri&s;h amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. We often &s;ee the independent man clad in plain gar|ments, while the &s;ons of &s;ervility are robed in gor|geous apparel. The whole art of independence con&s;i&s;ts in keeping our de&s;ires within our power of gratifying them. While we do this, whether the inventory of our goods and chattels be long, or &s;hort; whether our power be narrow, or uncircum|&s;cribed, we &s;hall lean on no man, we &s;hall be influen|ced by no man, but, lords, and &s;overeigns of our|&s;elves, we &s;hall be ma&s;ters of our own re&s;olves. On the contrary, the moment we &s;uffer our wants to ad|vance beyond the line of our ability, neither the wealth of both Indies, nor the power of an ancient Caliph, can elevate us above the pro&s;trate &s;ervility of dependence.</P>
<P>THERE has been introduced into our country a mode of living very unfriendly to this noble &s;pirit of which we are di&s;cour&s;ing. We &s;hall be convinced of this, and perhaps di&s;cover a remedy for this pub|lic di&s;ea&s;e, by examining its origin and progre&s;s. At the clo&s;e of the revolutionary war, much of the pub|lic debt was in the hands of men in needy circum|&s;tances. To relieve their own wants, and &s;upport their families, they &s;old the price of their toil at a &s;mall
<PB N="14" REF="037067_0014_100C433462D484E8">
part of the nominal value. This began the fir&s;t act in the great farce of American &s;peculation. The &s;ale of lands followed; and the&s;e negociations were carried to an amazing extent. Fortunes on paper were created in a day. Men ro&s;e at once from pe|nurious ob&s;curity, and blazed, and dazzled in all the &s;plendor of opulence. They revelled in the luxu|ries of wealth; became o&s;tentatious of their riches; built hou&s;es, &s;et up equipages, and furni&s;hed tables merely to &s;hew the world how much money they could throw away.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pirit of &s;peculation &s;pread, rapidly as the fogs of a vernal atmo&s;phere, until it had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e|very cla&s;s of the community. All were making ha&s;te, not only to be rich, but al&s;o to be luxurious. The bubble of imaginary wealth rai&s;ed millions to ba&s;k in the blaze of pro&s;perity; millions who evi|dently beheld in its broad tran&s;parent bo&s;om all the glories of a new heaven and a new earth. As it ex|panded they were elevated, until its fatal explo&s;ion, and they found them&s;elves &s;truggling in the dirt from which they fir&s;t emerged.</P>
<P>BUT when the phantom fled from our deluded country it left behind a foul progeny; it left us all our habits of profu&s;ion and extravagance. The &s;im|ple manners and rigid economy of our ance&s;tors, had been expelled from the nation; the productions of our own &s;oil could not regale our fa&s;tidious appetites; the manufactures of our own country were too plain for her proud &s;ons and daughters; and our wants, originating from this &s;ource, have reduced us to a &s;ervile dependence on foreign nations for our food and raiment.</P>
<P>IT is for you, Gentlemen, if you would be inde|pendent, to re&s;tore primitive plainne&s;s. In the Ame|rican war, when our country &s;truggled with unutter|able
<PB N="15" REF="037067_0015_100C4335E9CBFF38">
difficulties, how did the &s;pirit of our ance&s;tors walk abroad in the maje&s;ty of independence? Beauty was then clad in garments which her own hand had wrought; and blu&s;hing in unadorned loveline&s;s, felt &s;ecure of conque&s;t without the aid of A&s;iatic or Euro|pean auxiliaries. Tho&s;e who then fought, waited not until they could be robed in purple, and fine li|nen; but, dre&s;&s;ed from the loom where our mothers toiled to cloath their &s;ons for the long campaign, they ru&s;hed from their native hills, terrible in the battles of their country, and victorious over her foes. The temperance, the economy, the &s;implicity, the indu&s;try of tho&s;e times, would render our country independent of every nation on earth; and each individual of us entirely independent of all the influ|ence of his neighbours, and perfectly ma&s;ter of his own re&s;olves.</P>
<P>LOOK out, and behold the independence of all creation. The oak grows from the earth, drinks the dewy &s;howers, warms by the rays of &s;ummer noon, and expands its verdant foliage to the &s;weep|ing breeze of evening; yet, tho' fed, and &s;upported, by all the elements of nature, it leans to none of them, but lifts its branches towards heaven, and rears its head aloft in all the maje&s;ty of independence.&mdash; The ox on the plain lows without permi&s;&s;ion from a neighbour grazer. The wolfe a&s;ks not his kindred prowler of the fore&s;t when he may leave his rocky den, &s;talk down from the mountain, or howl to the di&s;mal re&s;pon&s;es of midnight echo. Even the dog, that fawns on man &s;o much, begs not a brother dog for leave to bark. Every thing but man pre|&s;erves its native independence.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, Gentlemen, independence be the pre|&s;erving principle of the Univer&s;e; if the brutes by their in&s;tincts, and the very trees by &s;ilent ex|ample &s;eem to teach it to man; if the influence of
<PB N="16" REF="037067_0016_100C433B3ACCB048">
it pre&s;erves the exi&s;tence of nations; if the de&s;igns of your A&s;&s;ociation mu&s;t expire when they &s;hall no longer be nurtered by this principle; if in our coun|try your arts cannot flouri&s;h unle&s;s they flouri&s;h un|der its fo&s;tering hand, then let independence be the great my&s;tery of all your trades, the fir&s;t and la&s;t maxim of your lives.</P>
<P>SHOULD any imagine this path to mechanical im|provement, &s;teep of a&s;cent, and difficult to be trod|den, let them with me, a little while, contemplate the importance of tho&s;e arts; and they cannot then want motives to animate, and to urge their exer|tions. To &s;peak on this part of the &s;ubject is dif|ficult indeed; for it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to look out a point of beginning, or to fix any ultimate boun|dary to di&s;cour&s;e. I can &s;ee nothing; I can think of nothing, which does not hold up to me the im|portance of your arts. Convenience is indebted to them no le&s;s than &s;uperfluity; and it would be dif|ficult to &s;ay whether they mo&s;t advance the utilities or the ornaments of life. Is there any thing com|modious, u&s;eful, or ornamental; is their any thing beautiful, grand, &s;ublime, or magnificent, among the works of men, which did not originate from them, as naturely, and as nece&s;&s;arily as &s;treams originate from their fountains.</P>
<P>LOOK at your white en&s;ign which to day has waved in the winds of heaven. The world of me|chanic philo&s;ophy is epitomi&s;ed on that wonderful production of nature's admired copie&s;t, and arts mo&s;t ingenious pupil.</P>
<P>WHAT built the numerous cities, what rai&s;ed the va&s;t palaces which glitter along the &s;hores of our country? What &s;pread this town on the banks of a river once rolling its black waves thro' the &s;haggy bo&s;om of a fore&s;t? Whence tho&s;e edifices, catching
<PB N="17" REF="037067_0017_100C433CC71AEC88">
the gazing attention of the traveller? Whence this temple, reared on ground, where er&s;t the unhallowed foot of barbarity beat the &s;haded &s;od? This lofty temple, who&s;e broad front blazes &s;o far in the &s;un|beams of evening, who&s;e con&s;ecrated dome &s;o often re echos with the &s;ound of morning hallelujahs.&mdash; All the&s;e grew up under the fo&s;tering hand of mechan|ic arts; and all the&s;e are but a &s;mall part of their many productions. It would be endle&s;s to trace them through all their connexions with the mo&s;t impor|tant tran&s;actions of man; to tell how by them war is armed with all his terrors; by them peace is robed in all her allurements; by them agriculture "hews the hard rock, and harrows up the plain;" by them commerce freights the wealth of every clime, a&s;&s;o|ciates the nations of di&s;tant worlds, and encircles e|very region of the earth in one broad horizon.</P>
<P>THE improvement of mechanic arts in our coun|try will expand into va&s;t importance, when we con|&s;ider our immen&s;e importation of foreign manufac|tures. We know that from thence our &s;hips are rigged for the &s;ea; from thence our hou&s;es receive their ornaments; and the very beds on which we re|po&s;e our&s;elves are fitted up, and &s;ent to us by fo|reigners. We are, every one of us, dre&s;&s;ed by other nations. Columbian beauty wraps her white limbs in the lawn of a foreign loom; and the valour of America does not yet di&s;dain to wear a Briti&s;h liv|ery. The materials of which the&s;e were wrought, perhaps, were worth one hundredth part the price at which we purcha&s;e them. Nine hundred of every thou&s;and dollars, paid by us for imported manufac|tures, rewards the &s;uperior &s;kill of the foreign arti&s;t. The&s;e mu&s;t be obtained in exchange for the un|wrought productions of our own &s;oil. How va&s;tly again&s;t us the balance in this exchange. What a trifle, growing on the plains of Flanders, or the hills of China, will, before it arrives at the hands of one of
<PB N="18" REF="037067_0018_100C433E56B4ED60">
our hu&s;bandmen, purcha&s;e the labours of his whole year. I have &s;een the company, at a birth-night ball, glittering in the &s;poils of a hundred &s;ea&s;ons. I|magine, therefore, if you can, Gentlemen, imagine, a &s;ubject more important, more intere&s;ting, to our country than the improvement of American arts and manufactures; for until we can excel foreigners, this importation cannot be prevented. Will not, then, the improvement of your arts be a rich re|ward for all the labour it can co&s;t you?</P>
<P>THE importance of your arts will be &s;till more con&s;picuous, if we con&s;ider the political influence of that noble &s;pirit of independence by which they are cheri&s;hed and improved. In all countries wealth is power; and therefore the mo&s;t wealthy are the mo&s;t powerful. He, who can &s;upport one man, will be more powerful, than he, who cannot &s;upport one. If one thou&s;and pounds a year will feed ten depen|dents, ten thou&s;and pounds a year will feed one hun|dred. Every acce&s;&s;ion of wealth will produce a new acce&s;&s;ion of power. Thus it was over all Europe in the days of feudal dominion. The tyrant, whe|ther a prince, or a lord, who could, by parceling out his lands, pay the greate&s;t number of &s;oldiers, was ever mo&s;t powerful. Thus it is in the Ottoman realms at this day. The Grand Seignor is &s;ole pro|prietor of all the lands; and the&s;e con&s;titute the whole wealth of the empire. He is, therefore, the unre&s;i&s;ted, and undi&s;puted lord, not only of the &s;er|vices, but of the lives, of his trembling va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>THE genius of our government is not like tho&s;e; but tho' va&s;tly different, it is quite as liable to be wielded by that kind of power. Altho' every thing with us is done by &s;uffrage; yet he, who can bring to the place of election, one thou&s;and, who eat bread from his table, will be as powerful, as a thou&s;and who&s;e wealth can &s;upport none of the&s;e dependents.
<PB N="19" REF="037067_0019_100C43416EBD06E0">
Here we behold the birth of ari&s;tocracies; and they grow up, and gather &s;trength, from all tho&s;e cau&s;es which collect the wealth of a nation into the hands of a few. Great individual wealth has an influ|ence, ho&s;tile to the fir&s;t principles of our go|vernment. This influence ought to be oppo&s;ed, or, like a troubled ocean, it will break in upon us, and deluge the liberties of our nation. In this op|po&s;ition nothing can be &s;o efficient as individual in|dependence; as that &s;pirit by which your arts mu&s;t be fo&s;tered, and improved; that &s;pirit which will animate every artificer, who&s;e habits of life &s;et him beyond reliance on the rich, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill renders him nece&s;&s;ary to the luxurious, and who&s;e erect and independent &s;oul will never lean from its own ba&s;is to &s;upport the powerful.</P>
<P>ALTHO' this country has not felt the effects of ex|orbitant individual wealth, altho' no proud ari&s;toc|racy hitherto has laid its ma&s;&s;y hand on this govern|ment; yet if ever accident, or any permanent cau&s;e, &s;hould throw too much wealth into the hands of a few, this &s;pirit of power, "this goblin damned," would ri&s;e &s;ecretly, like "the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s;" or gathering audacity from an accumu|lation of the cau&s;es which fir&s;t gave it exi&s;tence, it would finally &s;talk abroad at noon-day, in all the haughty forms of u&s;urped authority, and in&s;olent oppre&s;&s;ion. If ever this &s;hould happen in our coun|try, then would an independence like yours, the in|dependence of numerous, intelligent, and re&s;pecta|ble citizens, be too mighty for this genius of mi&s;chief, and hie him back to the foul region from which he aro&s;e.</P>
<P>THINK not, Gentlemen, that I would degrade your A&s;&s;ociation into a democratic club. The&s;e clubs are the birth places of party &s;pirit. Here young faction is cradled, and nur&s;ed, until with gi|gantic limbs &s;talking forth he can trample on law,
<PB N="20" REF="037067_0020_100C321EE9DECFA0">
religion, and humanity. That independence, which I would recommend, is not the independence of a party, but of the individual. It is the independence of a man, and not of a faction. Its votary is of no party, he is of the community. You, therefore, Gentlemen, in guarding again&s;t the influence of wealth, will never enquire from what department of the community that influence originated. In the&s;e political efforts, you will never &s;tand forth as a me|chanic a&s;&s;ociation, but as &s;o many unconnected in|dividuals, taught by long habits of independence, to oppo&s;e every influence which may ri&s;e up to o|verthrow the principles of our government.</P>
<P>THE importance of your arts will &s;hine with the mo&s;t engaging lu&s;tre, when we behold their improve|ment collecting you together as a benevolent a&s;&s;o|ciation. Altho' our country feeds mo&s;t of her chil|dren with a liberal profu&s;ion, yet many, and many, are the &s;ons and daughters of want. Truly was it &s;aid to mortals; "The poor you always have with you." That ho&s;t of contingencies which perpetu|ally war again&s;t human hopes, can, and often do, in a day, lay wa&s;te all our expectations. Have you not &s;een tho&s;e who&s;e bounty fed thou&s;ands reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging? How often death transfixes with one dart two kindred bo&s;oms; and leaves their young orphans, the tender blo&s;&s;oms of their love, to be blighted by the cold unkindne&s;s of a world! Few are the joys of many. They &s;eldom ta&s;te the whole&s;ome meal, or feel the warm garment, or &s;ee the bright fire. Often do they &s;tand the bare|footed companions of unhou&s;ed nakedne&s;s, &s;hivering in the howling winds of December midnight.</P>
<P>SHALL they be doomed to cea&s;ele&s;s wretchedne&s;s? Will not charity nouri&s;h them in her own bo&s;om? For their relief, and for our joy in relieving them, has not the hand of nature woven the fine filaments of
<PB N="21" REF="037067_0021_100C43460EC6F968">
compa&s;&s;ion into the texture of our hearts? That be|nevolence, Gentlemen, which your A&s;&s;ociation in|culcates, will never pa&s;s by them on the other &s;ide of the way. You will cheer their gloomy abodes with the voice of con&s;olation. You will cau&s;e the widow|ed heart to &s;ing for joy. You will re&s;cue young in|nocence from the temptations of cruel nece&s;&s;ity; and lead tho&s;e by the hand who have none to direct their &s;teps. How then do your arts ri&s;e in importance when benevolence becomes the in&s;eparable compan|ion of their improvement!</P>
<P>I FEEL &s;till an additional proof of the importance of your A&s;&s;ociation, when I behold a&s;&s;embled on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;o large a collection of &s;uch Ap|prentices. Young Gentlemen, we all rejoice to &s;ee you here; to me it is doubly grateful. It brings back to memory the days of my own apprentice&s;hip. What my Ma&s;ter, my Father, then taught me, I will now &s;ay to you. Be not &s;atisfied, before you perfect|ly know, whatever you undertake to learn. If there be any excellence in your trade, if there be any prai&s;e which can be merited by you, cea&s;e not to labor, and to meditate, until you have obtained that ex|cellence, until you have de&s;erved that prai&s;e. Youth is the &s;tuff of which your whole characters mu&s;t be wrought. If you wa&s;te this, or work it up into vi|cious habits your characters will be contemptible, and your lives wretched. The idle boy will be an idle man; the ignorant boy will be an ignorant man; the vicious boy will be a vicious man You never &s;aw a man, idle, and ignorant, and vicious, who was not poor, and di&s;pi&s;ed, and mi&s;erable. If, therefore, you would be happy and re&s;pectable men, you mu&s;t now be indu&s;trious, &s;ober, and thoughtful; you mu&s;t turn your eyes from every temptation, nor even &s;et a foot in the path of vice.</P>
<P>YOU have parents who&s;e hearts throb with anxiety
<PB N="22" REF="037067_0022_100C4347AE424518">
for your &s;ucce&s;s in life. Your pro&s;perity will cheer them to the very evening of their days; your ruin would carry them &s;orrowing to the grave. Your Ma&s;ters have this day pre&s;ented you to the public; and in this hallowed temple, with the eyes of all this a&s;&s;embly upon you, they now con&s;ecrate you to your country. Remember you mu&s;t one day become cit|izens, you mu&s;t one day &s;olemnize the rites of this &s;ociety; and when your ma&s;ters &s;hall be taken from your head, may a double portion of the &s;pirit of this in&s;titution, like the mantle of the departing pro|phet, forever re&s;t upon you.</P>
<P>SINCE the&s;e things are &s;o, Gentlemen, what &s;hall we &s;ay? Can you purcha&s;e the objects of your A&s;&s;o|ciation at a price too dear? Will you reluct at any toil, any per&s;everance, any &s;acrifice of &s;uperfluity? Will you not cultivate tho&s;e arts which furni&s;h man with all his accommodations, all his ornaments? What tho' art can never equal nature; tho' &s;he can|not give that endle&s;s variety which blo&s;&s;oms round the globe; tho' &s;he cannot arrange like the &s;y&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, nor &s;pread over her works the co|louring of the rainbow, nor touch them with that poli&s;h which &s;hines on the front of heaven; yet can &s;he continue to invent, and to improve the produc|tions of tho&s;e inventions, until the world of art &s;hall blu&s;h with a beauty, almo&s;t as perfected, as the creation of nature. Shall a country like ours, &s;o rich in &s;oil, &s;o multifarious in productions, &s;toop to depend on other nations for the nece&s;&s;aries of life? When will Columbia, like another China, di&s;tribute her rich wrought manufactures to every nation of the globe? Will you not lure improvement from the embattled &s;hores of Europe? Already &s;he &s;tands on the margin of the deep, trembling at the thunder of war. How long &s;hall &s;he look wi&s;hfully over the wide Atlantic, and hope in vain to behold the &s;ail whitening on the horizon; the &s;ail which &s;hall waft her to the bo&s;om of her &s;i&s;ter liberty, in the peace|ful,
<PB N="23" REF="037067_0023_100C434941E342D8">
and happy regions of our country? Shall not arts be cultivated? Does not the genius of independence give them to flouri&s;h into perfection? Yes, that mighty genius of independence, who, &s;trong as the angel wielding the four winds of heaven, holds over our go|vernment the broad aegis of protection, while law, and freedom, and morality, and religion, &s;it &s;miling be|neath its ample &s;hade. Is there not in benevolence, in goodne&s;s, a charm of almighty allurement? Is it not all we love in mortals, all we adore in God? Is it not circled in the embrace of your in&s;titution? Does not the tearful eye of di&s;tre&s;s every hour call it into ex|erci&s;e. Per&s;evere then, Gentlemen, we know you will per&s;evere; we know you will pur&s;ue the path of improvement; we know you will perfect the no|ble de&s;igns of your in&s;titution; and we know while you imitate the handy work of the Great Ma&s;ter Builder of the Univer&s;e, you will feel the full blaze of his divine munificence kindling in your &s;ouls the ardent glow of benevolence.</P>
