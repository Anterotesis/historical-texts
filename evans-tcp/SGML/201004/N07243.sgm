<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN my la&s;t, of the 17th of December, publi&s;hed in the &s;upplement to your Gazette N^o. 1428, I promi&s;ed you a copy of col. Grant's letter, wrote from Keehowee to our lieutenant-governor the 3d of July 1760; and that I would al&s;o endeavour to vindicate our Rangers from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nju|rious treatment: my copy of this letter I now &s;end you, and will be an&s;werable for the exactne&s;s of it, as I compared it my&s;elf very carefully with the original laid before the a&s;&s;embly the 11th of July 1760, when I had the honour of a &s;eat there. The ob&s;ervant reader of my former letter, might ea&s;ily perceive it could not have been long about, from &s;everal matters contained therein; particularly general Amher&s;t's let|ter, taken from the London Gazette of the 19th of September, which arrived here but a day or two before its publication. The &s;ight of col. Grant's in&s;inuation again&s;t the Rangers, in the general's letter, with re|&s;pect to their behaviour in the fir&s;t campaign, deter|mined me to publi&s;h the colonel's &s;econd letter, not only in hopes of clearing the&s;e people, but, by doing &s;o, of an&s;wering a &s;till more material purpo&s;e that will be mentioned hereafter: this, and another of the 4th of June, were all the letters that were laid before the a&s;&s;embly from any regular officer that campaign: The la&s;t was publi&s;hed by authority, and why the

This is the be&s;t rea&s;on I can give why you had them not before.</P>
<P>In the <HI>weekly Gazette</HI> of the 4th of June and 16th of July, are two letters from "THE CAMP" at Ninety-Six and Fort Prince George, dated the 27th
<PB N="5" REF="009243_0004_1030C8D5850366C8">of May, and 2d of July, 1760, the fir&s;t of which furni&s;hes only a few hints; the la&s;t &s;eems calculated (notwith&s;tanding its being dated the day before) to be explanatory of the colonel's la&s;t letter, in which manner it will be chiefly made u&s;e of. Whenever the&s;e letters are referred to, to avoid long repetitions, I beg leave to mention only the numbers of the gazettes they are contained in, N^o. 81 and 87.</P>
<P>'Tis needle&s;s to &s;ay, how commendably and indu&s;|triou&s;ly cautious the publi&s;her of that paper h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s been, to prevent being in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected of any prej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ice again&s;t col.

<P>In the paper N^o. 80, immediately preceding the fir&s;t letter, the publi&s;her informs us, "<HI>as it is expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted the advices from the army will henceforth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> daily more and more intere&s;ting, the public are de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, that ALL the intelligence publi&s;hed in this paper, and dated from</HI> the Camp, <HI>is from</HI> good <HI>authority, and may</HI> SAFELY <HI>be</HI> depended <HI>on; &s;ometimes perhaps, reperts from or concerning the army may be mentioned, but the next &s;ucceeding advices from</HI> "the Camp," <HI>will confirm, correct, or contradict them.</HI>"</P>

<P>This extraordinary letter the curious reader is de&s;i|red to compare throughout with the colonel's; to en|able him &s;o to do, notwith&s;tanding its length, I mu&s;t beg you'll give it a place next before his: indeed it would go very much again&s;t me to part them, as they &s;eem &s;o nearly related; the printed letter appear|ing to be an excellent <HI>prophetical</HI> commentary on the other, and, as &s;ome think, wrote by the colonel him|&s;elf, e&s;pecially, &s;ince a pa&s;&s;age in the po&s;t&s;cript that &s;eems to contradict this &s;uppo&s;ition, is declared to be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urious.

<P>Before I leave this matter, I would de&s;ire the reader to ob&s;erve, that, excepting in this &s;u&s;picious po&s;t&s;cript, Col. M********Y is no where m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ioned, either di|rectly or otherwi&s;e, throughout this very long and wonderful letter that col. Grant has &s;o particularly a|dopted. The rea&s;on of this ob&s;ervation you will &s;oon di&s;cover.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall make great u&s;e al&s;o of the colonel's fir&s;t letter, dated from Keehowee the day after the &s;ucce&s;s at the Lower-Settlements, publi&s;hed in both ga|zettes, I mu&s;t beg the favour of you to reprint that letter too, immediately after the letter N^o. 81 from Ninety-Six, and both before the colonel's adopted and &s;econd letters, that gentlemen may, without the trouble of referring back to their old news-papers (which may perhaps be mi&s;laid) be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an un|prejudiced manner, of my <HI>principal</HI> authorities in one view, and thereby more ea&s;ily judge, whether the quo|tations and rea&s;onings from thence are fair and to the purpo&s;e: but, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that the two pa&s;&s;ages in the colonel's fir&s;t letter, printed in <HI>italicks,</HI> were, at the time of its publication, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, for obvious prudential rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Referring my reader to my principal vouchers, the letters ju&s;t mentioned, which will be printed at the end (e&s;pecially to the three la&s;t) for all matters rela|ting to the fir&s;t campaign in 1760, let me here inform him, in a few words, that I &s;hall endeavour to prove the following propo&s;itions:
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That col. Grant had the principal direction of the fir&s;t campaign.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly.</HI> That he lo&s;t two fine opportunities that campaign, of relieving Fort Loudoun, and glo|riou&s;ly and effectually reducing the Cherokees.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="009243_0007_1030C8DD81A16390">
<HI>Thirdly.</HI> That our Rangers did not de&s;erve the cruel treatment they met with &s;eem him &mdash; <HI>N.B.</HI> It will be nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ew this, before we come to the &s;econd opportunity the colonel lo&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After the&s;e three propo&s;itions are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall pa&s;s to the colonel's &s;econd camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ign in 1761, in order, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to di&s;cover, if the former was of any, and what, u&s;e to the &s;econd, as a matter of mere experience. And here it will be &s;hewn.</P>
<P>That col. Grant remedied <HI>none</HI> of the matters he complained of in his fir&s;t campaign; that his con|duct glaringly demon&s;trates, his whole dependance was on the <HI>known</HI> cowardice of the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ians; for which and other rea&s;ons, he might have gone to the Valleys with ea&s;e, in the time he took <HI>before</HI> he returned to Keehowee, and &s;everal times afterwards. The &s;itua|tion the colonel has reduced us to with the Indians, will be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewn to be very &s;hameful and precarious; and that he may be &s;ent to us perhaps a third time to compleat his work, the con&s;equence of which will be pointed at.</P>
<P>I am now, in the fir&s;t place, to prove, from the colonel's letters, e&s;pecially from the fir&s;t, that he had the principal direction of the campaign in 1760; and con&s;equently, that to him we and our po&s;terity will be long indebted, in the highe&s;t degree, for the mighty wonderful &s;eats done therein. This having bean of late made a que&s;tion by &s;ome few, who, parti|cularly &s;ince col. Grant favoured us with his la&s;t vi&s;it, have complimented col. M&mdash;y with it, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s it here in limine; and how can we decide this point better, than by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e two letters, which were both laid be|fore the legi&s;lature of the province, and the fir&s;t prin|ted by authority, the only one that was &s;o during that campaign? Col. M &mdash;y, 'tis generally believed, had the THE NAME, which is not worth di&s;puting about: but who <HI>a&s;&s;umed the</HI> THING is the que&s;tion. It plainly appears then, by the fir&s;t letter, beyond all contradiction, &s;o much &s;o, that it is needle&s;s to trou|ble you with any quotations, that col. Grant thought
<PB N="9" REF="009243_0008_1030C8E36753BBD8">him&s;elf at lea&s;t upon an <HI>equal</HI> footing with col. M&mdash; &mdash;y, from the &s;hare he claims of the merit in plan|ning and ordering, as well as in executing the &s;ucce&s;s|ful enterprize there mentioned; which, though it is amazing to think, how he could <HI>aim</HI> at making it of half the importance <HI>he did,</HI> may be truly called a well|conducted &s;oldier-like tran&s;action; the only one in both campaigns worth relating. In HIS &s;uppo&s;ed con|&s;equences of it, in regard to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential object of the war, a Peace, does he not &s;tep &s;till higher? when <HI>alone</HI> declaring, <HI>"the correction you will allow has been pretty &s;evere; and I dare &s;ay, the whole nation will readily come into terms, and will not be very fond of breaking them; and I think peace with them is a de&s;ira|ble event for this province;"</HI> which mo&s;t improbable dare-&s;ay, that he takes &s;o much care to a&s;&s;ure his ho|nour is peculiarly his own (for col. M&mdash;y's opi|nion in this grand concern he is left to gue&s;s at) we find prevailed (by what immediately follows in that letter, which de&s;erves the reader's particular attention) and undoubtedly occa&s;ioned the long unhappy delay at Fort Prince George, at that mo&s;t critical juncture, when a moment's time ought not even to have been ri&s;qued. This in all probability was the great cau&s;e (as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew more at large by and by) of the lo&s;s of Fort Loudoun; the ma&s;&s;acre of great part of the garri&s;on; and of the la&s;ting di&s;honour then <HI>brought upon</HI> his maje&s;ty's arms; together with the long tram of misfortunes and heavy taxes, entailed upon the province ever &s;ince, and for years to come, even &s;uppo&s;ing the Indians to continue quiet, which I am afraid I may in my turn "<HI>dare &s;ay" too</HI> they will not very long (&s;hould the French but have an opportuni|ty of &s;upplying them) even if we &s;ubmit to pay for our people they have <HI>&s;till</HI> pri&s;oners among&s;t them.</P>
<P>To return from this digre&s;&s;ion, does not col Grant al&s;o a&s;&s;ume a right of advi&s;ing his honour, and corre&s;|ponding with him, when he &s;ays, <HI>"it will be nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould write a letter to encourage &s;ome of the Rangers to go to Fort Loudoun,"</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c and "I <HI>&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll be glad to hear from you as &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ible,</HI>" &amp;c.

<P>'Tis time now to &s;ee, what the &s;econd letter con|tains relative to this point; but fir&s;t, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to guard you not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;ubjects of each, which are of &s;omewhat different complexions; the fir&s;t, a pom|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s exaggerated account of an advantage gained over the Indians; the other, a mo&s;t curious apology for an unaccountable retreat.&mdash;This clue will help you to di&s;|cover col.

<P>If there can be any per&s;on unacquainted with any of the gentlemen that were on that campaign, who, not|with&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid, &s;till remains dubious in this point, he is reque&s;ted to compare the printed accounts of the two campaigns in 1760 and 1761 to|gether; and the great &s;imilarity, or rather "SAME|NESS" of the tran&s;actions, and miraculous relations of both, will, if any thing can, amply convince him, that none but one and the &s;ame great negotiating genius, ad|mirably &s;killed in Indian politicks, pre&s;ided throughout.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this matter, as it appears, by the&s;e two letters and from other circum&s;tances, that col. Grant had the greate&s;t &s;hare in the direction of all the principal actions of this campaign, even in thinking <HI>"it advi&s;eable to return to Fort Prince George"</HI> which his over-nice delicacy to col. M&mdash;y, to be &s;ure, made him de&s;irous to conceal; I &s;hall therefore mo&s;t readily concur with him, in giving him the credit of them all, excepting that which took its ri&s;e from Twelve-Mile creek, which he mu&s;t pardon me, for the rea&s;on ju&s;t now mentioned, for doubting of his
<PB N="13" REF="009243_0012_1030C8F187E656C0">right to any &s;hare in, unle&s;s in entirely marring the good effects of it, by that &s;ingular ill-timed <HI>"dare &s;ay"</HI> of his, which not only rendered that action altogether u&s;ele&s;s, but made it prejudicial too. Henceforward, when I &s;peak of the colonel, without mentioning any name, I would be under&s;tood to mean col. GRANT, and him only.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, that the colonel lo&s;t two fine opportunities in 1760, of relieving Fort Lou|doun, and gloriou&s;ly and effectually fini&s;hing the war with the Cherokees&punc;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and be&s;t opportunity of all was lo&s;t, by the ill judged unaccountable delays at Keehowee, after the &s;urprize of the Lower Settlements: for, had a proper and &s;peedy advantage been taken of the apprehen&s;ions tho&s;e Indians were then undoubtedly under, the army might, immediately after that &s;troke, have run through all the towns in the nation, with little hazard, as the terror of it would have &s;pread, fa&s;ter than the troops could have marched, and they would have been in the mid&s;t of the Indian towns, one after another, in all probability, before the Cherokees could have had time to recollect them&s;elves, and act properly in their own defence: be&s;ides this, the uncommonne&s;s of the thing, would have made a durable impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e &s;avages, and not unlikely on their abettors, the Creeks too, to the honour and dread of his maje&s;ty's arms for many gene|rations, and the la&s;ting &s;ecurity of this his province. This &s;uppo&s;ition col. Grant cannot po&s;&s;ibly object to as improbable, becau&s;e he has &s;aid, "<HI>we &s;hall make u&s;e of Ti&s;tory, &amp;c. to inform their nation, that though they</HI> ARE IN OUR POWER, <HI>we are ready to</HI> GIVE <HI>them peace</HI>"? From this &s;peech to our lieutenant governor too, whom &s;urely he would not, for the good of his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice and the &s;afety of the province, endea|vour to deceive, it plainly appears, he cannot deny this &s;tep to have been fea&s;ible. Now let us &s;ee if it was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary too. Had the attempt been made, and &s;ucce&s;s crowned it, the utmo&s;t expectations and wi&s;hes of the people would have been thereby an|&s;wered, together with general Amher&s;t's intentions,

Is it u&s;ual, when a garri&s;on is redu|ced to the la&s;t extremity, to de&s;i&s;t from taking all ad|vantages of an enemy, e&s;pecially a &s;avage one, when not only our friends liberties, but their lives too, were <HI>known</HI> to be at &s;take? why then were three weeks &s;uffered <HI>un|feelingly</HI> to be trifled away at Keehowee, for runners to go backwards and forwards upwards of 300 miles, by that means give &s;ome of the Rangers time and occa&s;ion to cool, be di&s;gu&s;ted, and de&s;ert; our friendly Indians to leave us; and the Cherokees an opportunity to recover their &s;pirits and de&s;pi&s;e us, to &s;teal our hor&s;es, and col|lect them&s;elves together by calling in all their hunters? and, above all, to ri&s;que the lives of above 200 fellow-&s;ubjects at Fort Loudoun, then looked upon by the Indians as their <HI>certain</HI> prey? when, by col. Grant's large&s;t accounts, we had but 40 Indian pri&s;oners, and all of them, excepting two or three, women and chil|dren (and the women they are known to regard very little) to in&s;ure our 200. Could it be thought, the

<P>But here give me leave to ob&s;erve, that though the expectations of the army's proceeding to Fort Lou|doun were &s;o general, as to be the &s;ubject of mo&s;t conver&s;ations, e&s;pecially after the troops left our back &s;ettlements, and the pa&s;&s;age of a letter, ju&s;t now quo|ted, from the <HI>"the Camp"</HI> at Ninety-Six, confirm|ed tho&s;e de&s;igns, which had al&s;o reached the fort at Keehowee, where it was heard, that it was fully de|termined to relieve Fort Loudoun, and they wi&s;hed it might be done in time. I &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding this, it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted &s;o roundly, after the return from Etchowih, that the army never intended to go to Fort Loudoun at all, appears, among&s;t the many extraordinaries done and &s;aid, and <HI>un&s;aid</HI> at that time, al|together the mo&s;t extraordinary of all; e&s;pecially when col.

Demere, &amp;c. to tell the Little-Carpenter, that he may come down with &s;ome other headmen, to treat; but that it mu&s;t be done in a few days, or he may expect to &s;ee</HI> ALL <HI>the towns in the</HI> UPPER <HI>nation in a&s;hes.</HI>" For God's &s;ake, what could be the view of this cruel tantalizing me&s;&s;age to that unfortunate gentleman? for &s;uch it mu&s;t be, if never intended to be performed: what purpo&s;e could it an&s;wer but to throw him off his guard, by making him depend on relief (which he certainly did) that was never intended, and thereby prevent his making a pu&s;h in time, before the &s;trength of the garri&s;on was
<PB N="16" REF="009243_0015_1030C8F827CDC220">too much exhau&s;ted by &s;hort allowance and bad pro|vi&s;ions? and farther, to make his maje&s;ty's arms appear &s;till more contemptible to the Indians, by &s;uch de&s;picable childi&s;h threats, mere ga&s;conading! which I am &s;orry to &s;ay has been kept too &s;teadily to ever &s;ince, and with ju&s;t as much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the colonel &s;ays, "<HI>in</HI> MY OWN <HI>opinion, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible for us to think of proceeding over the mountains; and if they had not been &s;urprized, the very country we have been in was impractible, if they had &s;pi|rit,</HI> which <HI>I</HI> much doubt of." This is the fir&s;t hint of any objection to go to Fort Loudoun, which was &s;o new and &s;urprizing to the a&s;&s;embly, that, in their an&s;wer to his honour the lieutenant-governor's congra|tulatory me&s;&s;age, &s;ent them on the &s;ucce&s;s at the Low|er-Towns, together with the colonel's letter, they could not help joining with his honour in &s;entiments, and words too, that "<HI>that important event might be a means of re&s;toring and e&s;tabli&s;hing peace with the Indians upon a &s;ure and la&s;ting foundation,</HI> IF PROPERLY IM|PROVED." The&s;e words of his honour, were then thought ominous, and to allude to the above expre&s;&s;ion of the colonel's.&mdash;How could the colonel, con&s;i&s;tent with the above declaration, <HI>write to his honour, "the nation was in our power,"</HI> and threaten, if the upper Indians, or tho&s;e <HI>"over the mountains"</HI> did not come <HI>"to treat,"</HI> to lay all <HI>"their towns in a&s;hes"?</HI> or, how could he de&s;ire the governor <HI>"to encourage &s;ome of the Rangers to carry flour and cattle to Fort Loudoun"?</HI> Could part of the Rangers do, what was <HI>"next to im|po&s;&s;ible"</HI> for the whole army to do?

<P>If it was never intended to go <HI>"over the moun|tains"</HI> to Fort Loudoun, what can be the pretence for not pu&s;hing immediately as far as was? the utmo&s;t expedition was required, as well to return to the ge|neral, as to relieve that garri&s;on; this would have

<P>I am very &s;orry to be obliged to acknowledge here, that the province did not, ju&s;t at that time, properly con&s;ult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own &s;afety, and act with that &s;pirit it apparently has ever &s;ince. Of this the remarka|ble regiment of 1000 men, &s;o ha&s;tily voted for the 13th of February 1760, to be rai&s;ed, paid, and di&s;|charged again by the 1&s;t of July following, is a very con&s;picuous in&s;tance. The members then met toge|ther (only 21 be&s;ides the &s;peaker) were divided in their opinions of the proper mea&s;ures to be taken at that mo&s;t critical juncture; ten were for agreeing with the committee, to provide for only 500 men, to proceed with &s;ome Rangers, to relieve Fort Prince George, at that time clo&s;ely be&s;et by the Indians; this the other eleven di&s;agreed to: immediately after this, a motion was made and carried, to provide for

The marches were certainly much more &s;low and tedious now than be|fore, and excepting that the pack hor&s;es were divided into brigades, and the&s;e &s;everally inter&s;per&s;ed, and guarded by the different corps, a general <HI>&s;amene&s;s</HI> ap|parently runs through both, This <HI>"di&s;po&s;ition"</HI> the colonel tells us, <HI>"was right in the country we were to act in,"</HI> and to be &s;ure it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o; otherwi&s;e, were it not too pre&s;umptuous, one would be apt to think that di&s;po&s;ition was more <HI>rightly</HI> calculated for the <HI>peo|ple</HI> he was to act <HI>again&s;t,</HI> than for the <HI>country</HI> he was to act <HI>in;</HI> and nothing can more evidently <HI>demon&s;trate,</HI> that the colonel's chief dependance, <HI>from the very be|ginning,</HI> was, on the <HI>known</HI> cowardice of the Indians, than his &s;etting out with <HI>this order of march;</HI> for had they &s;uddenly and vigorou&s;ly attacked any one corps, might not that have been cut to pieces before the next &s;aw its danger, or if it did, could have come to its a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in time, when it&s;elf was &s;o encumbered with two or three brigades of provi&s;ion-hor&s;es, be&s;ides batt hor&s;es, between it and the other.</P>

La&s;t year, he had about 2400 rank and file, including guides, waggoners (now packhor&s;e|men) Indians and negroes. Were not 800 out of the 1200 picked Royals and Highlanders he had in 1760, returned to New-York?

Now the Middle Settlements al&s;o, on this &s;ide Stickowih branch, are completely de&s;troyed; the colonel has been allowed &s;ufficient time too, &s;e|ven days, to march backwards and forwards from town to town, not 30 miles, be&s;ides <HI>the day</HI> the army is &s;up|po&s;ed to do nothing el&s;e but march from Etchowih to Cowhih, only 6 miles, which are included in the 30, to de&s;troy in all 390 hou&s;es and 800 acres of corn, and 70 of the&s;e hou&s;es and 100 acres of the corn clo&s;e to his camp too at Cowhih; was it not abundantly more la|borious and difficult, be&s;ides dangerous, to march backwards and forwards full 40 miles, with only his 1448 rank and file, to de&s;troy the 190 hou&s;es and 530 acres of corn on Stickowih branch, and at Ellijoy in his way back to Cowhih? which he did in le&s;s than half the time. But &s;uppo&s;ing the detachment left at Cow|hih had been ordered, might it not, in the time it had, have completed a po&s;t, &s;ufficient, with 100 tired men, to have &s;ecured all the wounded, and what provi&s;ions were left, only for a few days?

The 25th of June, let us march from Nouca&s;ih to the Dividings, only 22 miles: when the colonel was la&s;t at Etchowih, only 3 miles within Nouca&s;ih, he could go with all his wounded, LOADED pack-hor&s;es, and litters, from thence to his camp near War-Woman's creek, full <HI>thirty</HI> miles: this &s;hews he can make no difficulty here, unle&s;s he is &s;o very unfor|tunate as never to be able to make <HI>one &s;ingle</HI> good march, upon the &s;ame ground too, but when 'tis a <HI>&s;tolen</HI> one.</P>
<P>Now we are at the Dividings, let us halt the next day, the 26th. On the 27th, &s;uppo&s;e 500 men had been di&s;patched to Fort Prince-George, without or with all the &s;ick and wounded, with the pack-hor&s;es, to bring back the fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions that was ordered from Cowhih the 13th (to be &s;ure it would have been <HI>hurrying</HI> matters too much, to have left or &s;ent &s;uch orders <HI>before</HI>); and the &s;ame day, &s;uppo&s;e 1200 light troops, free from any incumbrance, only &s;ix or eight days provi&s;ion each, had been di&s;patched to the Valleys, might not the&s;e men have done that work too with ea&s;e, and returned back again to the Dividings in that time; the whole march, backwards and forwards, not exceeding 100 miles at farthe&s;t; as good a route too as any the troops had gone yet; and the &s;even Valley towns lay all in one open valley, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t not exceeding 12 miles. The&s;e 8 days would have brought the 4th of July, when at lea&s;t 10 days provi&s;ion would have been left for the colonel's detachment at the Dividings; indeed there would have been more, becau&s;e the 500 with the

Here are 124 miles marched in five &s;ucceeding days (&s;hould be &s;ix from 28th of May to 2d of June) with|out a halt, and three of then encumbered with waggons, that is, 20 or 25 miles a day for 5 or 6 days together. Now is there any more than one &s;ingle day's march, according to the foregoing &s;cheme, &s;o long? the only long one propo&s;ed is 22 miles; the re&s;t are very ea&s;y indeed.

(hor&s;es and cattle, to be &s;ure, are not worth notice.) Notwith&s;tanding this, we &s;till finally confirmed and ratified the peace the 18th of December: and why could we not have done it as well in September, and &s;aved our 500 pounds, not tribute, to be &s;ure, the Indians won't take it in that light, but charity-money, be&s;ides other expences? Indeed the dread of ill u&s;age to our unhappy fellow &s;ubjects among&s;t them, was the principal motive in the a&s;&s;em|bly, for giving that &s;um; next to the colonel's ma|nagement having &s;o u&s;ele&s;sly exhau&s;ted our funds, and di&s;gu&s;ted our people in general, that it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible for the province to rai&s;e any re&s;pectable body of men, even to oppo&s;e them &s;hould they break out again, and much more has he put it out of our power to rai&s;e troops for other purpo&s;es: Be&s;ides, as the peace WAS FINALLY RATIFIED, the a&s;&s;embly, though they <HI>did not approve</HI> of its being &s;o without our pri&s;oners being FIRST delivered up, yet, that <HI>they</HI> might throw no impediment in the way of &s;o de&s;irable an event, were induced to vote this &s;um. But I would a&s;k here, if there was a pin to chu&s;e, between the eight <HI>acting</HI> headmen the Little-Carpenter had with him in September, and tho&s;e that attended him in De|cember? Why did they not the la&s;t time bring our pri&s;oners? They told us truly they were &s;till a hunt|ing; and &s;o they have been ever &s;ince, to this day, poor fellows!

</LETTER></P>
<P>Now, Sir, you plainly &s;ee the aukward and con|temptible &s;ituation the colonel's fine management has reduced us to with the Cherokees, even with our old friend too the Little-Carpenter. The expence this province alone (exclu&s;ive of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance) has been at in the war with the&s;e &s;avages, for very little more than two years, amounts to upwards of &pound;. 750,000 currency, more than equal to &pound;. 107,000 &s;terling, of which full two-thirds might have been &s;aved, had the colonel, in 1760, only marched immediately after the &s;urprize at the Lower Settlements, without any delays, and lo&s;s of time &s;pent in negotiations with the Indians, which no body, as ever I heard of, thought he had <HI>any</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s with; the province wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>only</HI> to fight them.</P>
<P>The Indians remain &s;till quiet, and perhaps they may continue &s;o 'till the French are able to &s;upply them, tho' even this is very doubtful, for the &s;pring is not yet far enough advanced, &s;o as to cover the trees with leaves, and give them the opportunity of that &s;ecure cover they &s;o much value in war. Our pri&s;oners are <HI>&s;till</HI> out upon the hunt, and if they are permitted to keep them (as well as the hor&s;es and cattle) or are paid for them,
<PB N="66" REF="009243_0065_1030C99C21BA0880">perhaps they may take compa&s;&s;ion on us, and trouble us no more, e&s;pecially as, 'tis to be hoped that, it will &s;oon be out of the power of the French to &s;upply them; this the matter &s;eems entirely to turn upon: but only &s;uppo&s;e this contingency &s;hould happen, what one rational &s;ecurity have we, that they would not immediately break out again and join them? Do not all their talks, all their behaviour, plainly &s;hew, they will do only what <HI>they</HI> plea&s;e, and are &s;o far from fearing, that they de&s;pi&s;e us and make us their <HI>dupes;</HI> and will keep in with us ju&s;t as long as it &s;uits their humour, or 'till they can be &s;upplied el&s;ewhere, and no longer?</P>
<P>The colonel, very &s;oon after his return from the French, after the affair at Fort Duque&s;ne, was &s;ent to us the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time, and did wor&s;e than nothing: He was &s;ent to us again, a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, and did twice as much: And, 'tis very probable, he has not yet &s;hewn us half he can do in the &s;ame way; another expedition may be &s;till nece&s;&s;ary; the Valleys, the Upper towns, the principal aggre&s;&s;ors, have not yet lo&s;t any of "THEIR <HI>mo&s;t valuable effects;</HI>" only &s;uppo&s;e (no unlikely thing) that tho&s;e &s;hould break out again, may we not have the colonel &s;ent to us a <HI>third</HI> time "<HI>to bring them to</HI> REASON"? and does the province want any thing more, than his pre&s;ence a third time, as a commander in chief, to make all our e&s;tates as purely <HI>negative,</HI> as the pay of the &s;oldiers and many of the officers was to them, when the monopolizing company of &s;uttlers took their la&s;t leave of the camp.</P>
<P>This, Mr. Timothy, is my apprehen&s;ion, and the principal occa&s;ion of this &s;econd trouble to you; and if the matters that are here taken notice of, are in the lea&s;t degree in&s;trumental to prevent &s;o terrible an evil, I &s;hall think I have done the public &s;ome &s;ervice; if not, <HI>liberavi animam mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> But, are we not particu|larly and extremely unfortunate, in the&s;e glorious and happy times all round us, when the numerous officers in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice have &s;o generally di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to name them all, and to particularize any, would be &s;hewing a want of de|licacy
<PB N="67" REF="009243_0066_1030C99F91EBD078">to the re&s;t; that in the&s;e times, I &s;ay, we &s;hould twice running have this gentleman &s;ent to our a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, upon a mo&s;t ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which he had each time very <HI>evidently</HI> in his power to accom|pli&s;h, and completely an&s;wer all our wi&s;hes; but in|&s;tead of doing it, has made matters abundantly <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> by mi&s;taking his talents and bu&s;ine&s;s too. Have we any thing to blame for this but pure ill fortune? Ma|ny have thought indeed, that the tran&s;actions in 1760 ought to have been timely laid before the general, which would perhaps have had &s;ome effect, to prevent this complete ma&s;ter of in&s;inuation, painting, and de|&s;ign, from coming here the &s;econd time; but who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was this? You'll &s;ay, the a&s;&s;embly ought to have concurred to give them the proper weight and &s;anction; but this could not be had from that a&s;&s;em|bly, who&s;e three years &s;itting, according to law, ex|pired a few days after the colonel left us, in Augu&s;t, 1760; and very &s;oon after the next a&s;&s;embly met, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of his late maje&s;ty's demi&s;e arrived, which very &s;oon occa&s;ioned that too to be di&s;&s;olved, before any thing of this &s;ort could have been properly done; and in the interim this gentleman was appointed <HI>again.</HI></P>
<P>Numberle&s;s advantages, no doubt, attend the pre|&s;ent glorious times, wherein his maje&s;ty's arms have &s;o univer&s;ally &s;ucceeded every where, but here; not in the colonel's rhetorical figurative manner, on <HI>paper</HI> only, but really in the downright <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Briti&s;h man|ner. But even among&s;t us, who are &s;o particularly unfortunate as to be the only exception, is it a &s;mall advantage, ari&s;ing purely from the&s;e times, to be able to point out the cau&s;e of our misfortunes, in a more open, plain and <HI>ea&s;y</HI> manner, than the times (as re|ported) no very great interval &s;ince, would have &s;uf|fered us to do con&s;i&s;tent with &s;afety and prudence? when it was &s;u&s;pected to be, av'rice <HI>all,</HI> and</P>

The beginning of la&s;t &s;ummer this article might have been bought for 14 s. per gallon, and even at 13 s. 9 d. as I have been <HI>well</HI> informed a con|&s;iderable quantity was then bought by the &s;uttler.

<P>Then as one gallon of rum that co&s;t at Keehowee in 1759, 50 s. 9&frac12; d. was never &s;old for more (though &s;ometimes for con&s;iderably le&s;s) than 6 l. per gallon. The &s;ame quantity that co&s;t only 29 s. 2 d. la&s;t &s;um|mer, ought to have been &s;old there, in order to gain the like proportional profit, at 3 l. 8 s. 10&frac14; d. (&s;ay 3 l. 9 s. or even 3 l. 10 s.) which leaves above 140 per cent. clear gain; but it was &s;till &s;old at 6 l. therefore the diffe|rence, 50 s. currency, upwards of 7 s. &s;terl. per gallon, that is above 170 per cent.

'Tis high time, Mr. Timothy, to fini&s;h this tedious letter. The matters mentioned therein, happened dur|ing the three difficult and laborious a&s;&s;emblies I had the honour to &s;erve in. Whether my remarks are to the purpo&s;e, or no, the candid reader will certainly be the be&s;t judge: I am &s;ure, he will at lea&s;t be convinced, that I have not, in that time, been inattentive to the mo&s;t materials concerns of the public. I &s;hall hardly ever trouble you with a third letter. I am con&s;cious of no prejudices again&s;t any man, or that I have exceeded the bounds that truth, honour, &s;incerity, and duty to the public pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Prejudices of MOST &s;orts, of a <HI>national</HI> nature, be|tween man and man, are contemptible to the la&s;t de|gree; but ALL tho&s;e of a <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> nature, are not only &s;o, but infamous and hurtful too, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the true general intere&s;t of the community. I call all tho&s;e <HI>deme&s;tic</HI> prejudices between man and man, where any &s;et of individuals of the &s;ame monarchy, becau&s;e they happen accidentally to be born in this &s;treet, this pari&s;h, this county, or this larger divi&s;ion of it, or for any other as partial trifling di&s;tinction whatever, are influenced thereby in their interdealings, connections and judgments, to the injury of their fellow &s;ubjects born in a different part. All the individuals of the &s;ame monarchy, from one extreme to the other, ought to be thought <HI>countrymen,</HI> and have &s;uch a regard for each other as is con&s;i&s;tent with the whole. The &s;mall limited preferences that nature may point out among friends and relations, can be but few, and if not car|ried beyond <HI>her</HI> bounds, <HI>cannot</HI> have a bad tendency, as <HI>none</HI> of her rules have. All the men in a pari&s;h, and more &s;o in a large divi&s;ion of a monarchy, cannot be thought to <HI>know</HI> each other; time and accident ought to be allowed their due effect with all &s;ubjects alike; and nothing can be more de&s;picable and prejudicial to a community, than for any &s;et of men, to make the intervention of what they <HI>contractedly</HI> call a <HI>countryman,</HI> the <HI>fine qu&acirc; non,</HI> or te&s;t of their &s;incerity, friend&s;hip, and favours. Is not this dividing a kingdom again&s;t it&s;elf, the con&s;equence of which we know very well from

<P><HI>P.S.</HI> As you have been &s;o long prevented, for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to print the foregoing letter, it gives me an opportunity of remarking (I wi&s;h I could &s;ay of congratulating the public) on the news from Fort Prince-George dated the 6th ult. and printed in the la&s;t weekly gazette, from whence we are <Q><HI>a&s;&s;ured, this is the firme&s;t peace that ever was made with the Cherokees;</HI></Q> that <Q><HI>the chain is bright, the path is &s;trait, the talk is good, the hatchet is buried, and the &s;un &s;hines.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>The white</HI> PRISONERS <HI>are</HI> deli|vering <HI>up, and the commandant expects</HI> the whole <HI>e|very day, with</HI> all the negroes, <HI>in terms of the trea|ty.</HI></Q> One <HI>pri&s;oner,</HI> and no more, as ever I heard of (perhaps a breeding woman, and &s;o reckoned PRI|SONERS) was <HI>delivered</HI> up (before the date of that letter) &s;ince the Little-Carpenter left Charles-Town in December la&s;t. At the time that <HI>double</HI> or <HI>treble</HI> pri&s;oner was brought in, that politician was &s;aid to be coming down with the re&s;t, thirty more, and might be expected in a few days. Now it &s;eems, he is gone to Virginia.&mdash;Our pri&s;oners are STILL out a hunt|ing:

<P>The two principal criterions, to judge of the Indians peaceable intentions (together with their continuing quiet) are, their delivering up our pri&s;oners, and not joining the French &s;hould they be able to &s;upply them. This la&s;t, which is by far the &s;ure&s;t &s;ign, would de|mon&s;trate their &s;incerity; but this we have not an op|portunity to judge by yet, and God forbid we ever &s;hould.

<P>ON the arrival of the waggons the &s;econd time from Monck's corner, we proceeded on our march the 17th in&s;tant, at four in the morning, for Ninety-&s;ix fort, leaving an officer with a detachment from the Highlanders to bring up the waggons that were not ready to march from the camp; that day encamped at Miln-creak; 18th, at Hollow-creek, where the remainder of our waggons, with the detachment joined us: The 19th and 20th were obliged to halt to refre&s;h the hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and repair the broken waggons; <HI>here king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ler and about forty Catawbas fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ured us with their company:</HI> The 21&s;t, the arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reached the Little Saluda river, after being &s;everely pelted with rains during the march; the rains con|tinued all that night, and were &s;o heavy next day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to prevent our marching: The 23d we lodged at Saluda Old-Town, where there is only the ve&s;tige of one hou&s;e; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kin joined us; and on Saturday 24th May, at ten o'clock in the morning, we arrived at Ninety &s;ix, where there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ockade, and a great number of mi&s;erable people, chiefly women and children, cooped up in it.

After killing all we could find, and burning every hou&s;e in the nation, we marched to Keowee, and arrived the &s;econd of June (after a march of above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> miles without &s;leeping) at four in the evening at fort Prince-George. There mu&s;t have been from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 to 80 Cherokees killed, with about 40 pri&s;oners; I mean men, women, and children.

The &s;urpri&s;e in every town was almo&s;t equal, as the whole affair was the work of a very few hours. They had, both at E&s;tatoe and Sugar-Town, plenty of ammunition, which was de&s;troyed; and every where a&s;toni&s;hing magazines of corn, which were all con&s;umed in the flames: they had not even time to &s;ave their mo&s;t valuable effects: The &s;oldiers &s;ound money in many hou|&s;es; 3 or 4 watches were got; their wampum, their cloaths, &s;kins, and in &s;hort every thing. Many loaded guns went off when the hou&s;es were burning. I had almo&s;t forget to tell you that we itnended to &s;ave Sugar-Town, as the place neare&s;t the fort (where they even had a &s;tockade fort): Cen|tries were placed for the &s;ecurity of the town, but we found the body of a dead man, whom they had put to the torture that very morning, it was then no longer po&s;&s;ible to think of mercy.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bags for carrying flour were made with all expedition, out of the &s;oldiers tents and waggon-cloths, and pack-&s;addles, with the nece&s;&s;ary furniture for them, out of bear-&s;kins and bullock hides; all the invalids were left to reinforce the fort and guard our baggage, for two &s;hirts, a bear-&s;kin and a blan|ket, with a little rum, was all that any officer could propo&s;e to carry: tents for the troops could not be thought of in our cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>"<HI>June</HI> 24th.

<P>"27th. In the morning we found our&s;elves within 18 miles of the neare&s;t town in the middle &s;ettlements, called Etchoey, one of their mother towns, and con&s;equently what they call a beloved one; if we were to be oppo&s;ed at all, this day's march was the time to look for an attack, and you may be|lieve we prepared accordingly, our picquet being formed from the line of regulars, this night the grenadiers and light in|fantry were relieved from their &s;hare of that duty, becau&s;e they were to march in front in the morning, and the two bat|talion corps formed the piquet, which fell in cour&s;e of ro&s;ter, to be commanded by capt. Peter Gordon. A few light hor&s;e went in front to make di&s;coveries, with a few more on the flanks, but where the ground was very &s;u&s;picious, platoons of grenadiers and light infantry, were ordered out to &s;cour the thickets, and other places of ambu&s;cade, the grenadiers and light infantry were followed by the Highlanders, and the Royal fell in the rear, next a baggage guard of regulars, in front of the baggage and packhor&s;es, which were led by offi|cers &s;ervants and waggoners, who were armed before we left fort Prince George; <HI>in the center of the packhor&s;es was an effi|cer and twenty men from the picquet, and in the rear of the whole was the captain of the picquet with 50 men and one offi|cer,</HI> FOLLOWED <HI>by the cattle under the care of a body of rangers.</HI></P>
<P>"After marching 12 miles, four Indians were di&s;covered, one of which was apprehended by Beamer the guide; he told COLONEL GRANT that the Indians did not expect us &s;o &s;oon, but to this HE paid no credit, as he was fatisfied they mu&s;t have &s;een us every day on our march, (the Indian is &s;till in cu&s;tody.) After marching a mile farther, we came to an ugly kind of plain, covered with wood and bru&s;h &s;o thick that one could &s;carce &s;ee three yards di&s;tance in &s;ome places; and an ugly muddy river, with &s;teep clay banks running through it, overlooked on one fide by a very high mountain, and on the other by hilly uneven ground, a &s;ituation, in all its parts, well adapted to the Indian method of fighting, and through this infernal place mu&s;t our road inevitably go, becau&s;e the creek or river was only practicable for the baggage and provi&s;ion hor&s;es in one place.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"COL. Montgomery informed you of our intended march from Keowee town. We left that place the 24th, and foor perceived that our guides had mi&s;informed us about the reads, very likely from ig|norance, a few perhaps had &s;ome little de&s;ign in repre&s;enting things in as favourable a light as po&s;&s;ible, in order to induce us to go on, that they might have &s;ome chance of recovering their hor&s;es, or &s;ome of their other effects; but let that be as it will, they are very bad judges of the &s;ort of road nece&s;&s;ary for the march of a body of troops, and when we came to have a little bru&s;h, they knew no road at all, I mu&s;t except from the number Beamer, who is hardy and intelligent, and Boyl and the Collier have merit; Jones behaved well 'till he was wound|ed; the others are not worth a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>"'Tis next to impo&s;&s;ible for troops to go to the Middle-Settlements without forming po&s;ts at different places: if the people who are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country had &s;pirit to defend it, there are pa&s;&s;es innumerable; the whole country the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t difficult I ever was in; a very few men properly conducted might retard the march of an army. But our friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Cherokees, were kind enough to give us no trouble, 'till we got near Etcho&eacute;, their beloved town. About SIX miles from that place, we found a con&s;iderable body of Indians, of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Settlements, with &s;ome Creeks and Chactaws (if we can believe people who pretend to know their language). They were po&s;ted upon very advantageous ground, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every pa&s;s, and &s;eemed determined to defend the town in the be&s;t manner they could; but the troops behaved &s;o remarkably well, that the Indians were drove from po&s;t to po&s;t, and the detachment arrived in very good order at Etche&eacute;, though I mu&s;t own the march was trouble&s;ome, the difficulties of the country not to be imagined, and the fire of the In|dians, though at a di&s;tance, as they have a number of rifles, did execu|tion. Poor capt. Williams with about 17 of our men killed, many of|ficers wounded, and above 60 men; tho&s;e we carried with us to the town, and have brought back with us to this place. I think there was a waggoner and a ranger killed, and &s;ive or &s;ix of them wounded: I am &s;orry that I cannot &s;ay any thing in their &s;avour, they behaved mo&s;t in|famou&s;ly, near fifty de&s;erted the night before we marched, and they run off to a man the moment they heard the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing begin, at which time poor capt. Morri&s;on was killed, when he was advancing and doing his duty like a gallant good officer. I a&s;&s;ure you he is a le&s;s to the prevince, but

One&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was likewi&s;e of u&s;e; in the rear, which was has purt, according to the order of march of that day.</P>
<P>"When the Indians found that it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent our ges|ting to the town, they endeavoured to cut off our pack-hertes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, but were prevented by the captain of the pirquet from doing us any harm in that way.

Peter Gorden who was upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at duty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> up the be&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t he could find, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their attack, and &s;aved every thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till a reinforcement was &s;ent to him, and then brough, up the whole to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> town ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">p.</P>
<P>"The Indians w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll not terget this attack &s;oon, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fifty men, forty of their dead bodies were found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> three different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I hardly think that they have &s;o many wounded in preportion, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> never fired but when they were near them. De&s;traying an Indian town may be creditable, but 'tis in fact a matter of no great con&s;equence, when the &s;avages have time to carry off their effects. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us dear. The killed I look upon as a tride, people are then prended for; but the wounded in a remote frontier is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance. We might have gone to any town in their nature, but we thould have had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to get at it, and then we thould have found it, or indeed rather them all abandoned, but the lift of our wounded mu&s;t have increa&s;ed, at &s;ixty miles from fort Prince George, it was impo&s;&s;ble to &s;end them back; there was no &s;uch thing as leaving them to fall into the hands of &s;avages, and it was ab&s;olutely impracticable to preceed with them; many of them are carried upon litters, none of them can walk, every one of them mu&s;t have an attendant, and &s;ome of them are in &s;uch a fituation, that they mu&s;t have two or three upon the march. The number of rangers much dimini&s;hed, &s;ome of their hor&s;es employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> not very fond of walking; in &s;hort, we were obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, in order to get hor&s;es for our waunded.</P>
<P>"In this &s;ituation col. Montgomery thought it advi&s;eable, to return to fort Prince George, and from thence to proceed to the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m|barkation. There is not an Indian within &s;ixty miles of the &s;ert, the frontier is therefore much advanced. The Cherckces have &s;uffered much, but they will not treat, and tis impo&s;&s;ible to force them to come into terms; that mu&s;t be a work of time, and you knew that no body of troops can extirpate an Indian nation. 'Tis really un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ky that a peace could not be brought about. We have &s;ucceeded in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ung we have attempted, the Indians have been beat every where, they never have had the &s;malle&s;t advantage, and yet the province is &s;till in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crape, for it appears to me that tho&s;e &s;avages cannot be convinced that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man is hone&s;t.</P>
<P>"We continued two days at E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chc&eacute;, and then &s;tale a march upon them in the night, to get clear of the dangerous pa&s;&s;es near that town, with our wounded and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;ions. They gave us no trouble the fir&s;t day's march. The &s;econd they intended to entertain us in a very &s;trong pa&s;s: they had come in three be aies near our camp: the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable body was &s;crprized in their camp on the top of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which com|manded a defile where we were to pa&s;s: they were imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">diately beat off, abandoned two bags of flour, a bag of ammunition, one of file, about 60 blankets, their t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">myhawks, wampum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.
