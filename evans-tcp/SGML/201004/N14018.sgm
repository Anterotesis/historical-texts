<HEAD>A NARRATIVE OF THE Strange Principles, Conduct and Character of the SHAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the infant &s;tate of civil power in America, &s;ince the revolution began, every infringement on the natural rights of humanity, every effort to undermine our original con&s;titution, either in civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, &s;aps the foundation of independency. To &s;ee a body of more than two thou&s;and people, having no will of their own, but governed by a few Europeans conquering their adherents into the mo&s;t unre&s;erv|ed &s;ubjection, argues &s;ome in&s;atuating power; &s;ome deep, very deep de&s;ign at bottom. To de&s;cribe what this power is will be the de&s;ign of the follow|ing Natrative, and by what means this people are &s;upported in their delu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017735_0003_0FA26A815EF56E28">
There are &s;ew people in this land no doubt but what have heard of the contents of VALENTINE RATHBUN'S Narrative, in which &s;ome gro&s;s ab|&s;urdities in point of doctrine and wor&s;hip are point|ed out. But &s;ince this people have increa&s;ed in numbers, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch orders and founded &s;uch in&s;titutions among them&s;elves as ren|ders it very ea&s;y to trace them in their di&s;cipline to the &s;eat and foundation of their power. For this purpo&s;e the writer thinks proper to lay open to the learned world, more particularly, the whole body of their di&s;cipline, that the publick may be able to judge for them&s;elves what this power is, and from what it proceeds.</P>
<P>The predominant principle in the heart of man is the love of dominion and preeminency. Pride is the root of all &s;in. From this principle the whole fabrick of that religion is founded. The&s;e people are artful, de&s;igning men, e&s;pecially their leaders. The common people who are impo&s;ed up|on are many of them very &s;incere. If any per&s;on opens his mind to them, as the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in is termed, they commonly gain their point. The rea&s;on of their &s;ucce&s;s may be attributed on the one hand to a very extraordinary &s;kill which the&s;e people have acquired in hearing confe&s;&s;ions; and on the other to a likene&s;s of principle and motive which creates a peculiar &s;ympathy and union. They are univer&s;ally of one &s;pirit in belief of, o|bedience to, and rai&s;ed expectations from their church. Their di&s;cipline is founded on the &s;up|po&s;ed perfection of their leaders: The Mother, it
<PB N="5" REF="017735_0004_0FA26A82165DFB90">is &s;aid, obeys God through Chri&s;t; European el|ders obey her; American labourers obey them: The common people obey them while confe&s;&s;ion is made of every &s;ecret in nature, from the olde&s;t to the younge&s;t. The perpetual labours of which gives their teachers experience and &s;kill. By this means the people are made to believe them&s;elves to be &s;een through and through in the go&s;pel gla&s;s of perfection by their teachers, as they expre&s;s them&s;elves, for hundreds of miles in an in&s;tant, and that they are arrived to that &s;tate of glory by which they behold not only the e&s;tate of the liv|ing, but of the dead, with innumerable worlds of &s;pirits good and bad.</P>
<P>When the extraordinary appearance of &s;trange exerci&s;e in their way of wor&s;hip cau&s;es a doubt in the minds of any &s;pectator, they frequently in|culcate the innocency of laying open the &s;ecrets of life, provided a confe&s;&s;ion is kept concealed, inti|mating the benefit of the experience of their leaders in particular ca&s;es of con&s;cience, as being privi|leged thereby with e&s;pecial opportunities to judge for them&s;elves concerning the truth of their pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such like arguments to a mind that begins to be open to their in&s;inuations, e&s;pecially where there has been the weight of &s;ome burden on the con|&s;cience beforetime, will by the allurement of the&s;e people, introduce a per&s;on partly from curi|o&s;ity, or &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion from the&s;e in&s;tructions, to u&s;e a familiarity of laying open the whole of his life, upon which the greate&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion is paid to the intended pro&s;elyte.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017735_0005_0FA26A8334738D20">
His principles and practices in life are all laid open&mdash;predominant vices expo&s;ed&mdash;habit of mind and thoughts of his heart are drawn from him. The per&s;on thus expo&s;ed receives in&s;truction ap|plicable to &s;ecret ca&s;es of con&s;cience; is told that there is no delu&s;ion but only in &s;in. That is it which they warn him again&s;t. And the&s;e people have a faculty to draw the attention of new pro|&s;elytes into a belief of extraordinary perfection in re&s;olving the difficulties laid before them, &s;tudiou&s;|ly di&s;engaging their attachment to common vice into a &s;pirit of idolatry in re&s;pect to them and their in&s;tructions, effectually to &s;ecure their domi|nion over the con&s;cience. The adherent finds &s;ome con&s;i&s;tency of moral in&s;tructions and &s;kill in determining ca&s;es of con&s;cience; an ea&s;y conque&s;t over former vices; &s;uddenly grows perfect in his own imagination; &s;ees on the one hand great con|formity in their &s;ociety, alike in &s;entiment, each one forgoing his old habitual cour&s;e, comented together in oppo&s;ition to a world of per&s;ecution, having one will to govern them though of the female &s;ex. Which &s;ympathy, love, power and union in this delu&s;ion they believe to be of God. On the other hand ob&s;erving &s;ome &s;pirit of intemperance a|mong tho&s;e who are not acquainted with this &s;plendid &s;cheme of new religion, he is thereby con|firmed in his error. Sometimes they endeavour to frighten tho&s;e whom they cannot allure, by throwing out a cen&s;orious &s;pirit; by judging all who fall not in with their way; which has the de|fired effect, more e&s;pecially with per&s;ons of a ti|morous make and con&s;titution, which is but a &s;ta|vi&s;h
<PB N="7" REF="017735_0006_0FA26A83A1E08FC8">&s;cheme in their delu&s;ion. Sub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es, are &s;trict injunctions laid on every adherent, not to weaken one another by &s;cruples of con&s;cience, trials and darkne&s;s, &s;uch ca&s;es be|ing re&s;erved to their elders and teachers; be&s;ides all records and general orders are kept concealed, excepting from the individuals who are particular|ly concerned.</P>
<P>The doctrines which are more clearly come to light &s;ince the fir&s;t ri&s;e of their religion, are as follows, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Church, is reconciled with man.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> That &s;ins confe&s;&s;ed to God's witne&s;&s;es are forgiven in the Church as &s;oon as for&s;aken.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That Chri&s;t is come a light into human nature, to enlighten every man that cometh into the world without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That no man is born of God until by faith he is a&s;&s;imulated into the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his Church.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That in obedience to that Church a man's faith will increa&s;e until he comes to be one with Chri&s;t in the millenium Church &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That every man is a free agent to walk in the true light, and &s;o to choo&s;e or reject the truth of God within him.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017735_0007_0FA26A87ECF070B8">
<HI>Seventh.</HI> Of con&s;equence that it is in every man's power to be obedient to the faith without which he &s;hall &s;uffer &s;o much lo&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> That this is the go&s;pel of the fir&s;t re|&s;urrection which is now preached in that Church.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth.</HI> That all who are born of God (as they explain the new birth) &s;hall never ta&s;te of the &s;e|cond death.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth.</HI> That tho&s;e who are &s;aid to have been regenerated among Chri&s;tians are only regenerat|ed in part, therefore are not a&s;&s;imulated into the character of Chri&s;t in his Church while here in the body, of con&s;equence not ta&s;ting the happine&s;s of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, cannot e&s;cape in part the &s;e|cond death.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventh.</HI> They hold that the word everla&s;ting when applied to the puni&s;hment of the wicked, refers only to a limited &s;pace of time, excepting in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who fall from their Church.</P>
<P><HI>Twelfth.</HI> That the &s;econd death having power over &s;uch as ri&s;e not into the character of Chri&s;t in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, will in due time fill up the mea&s;ure of his &s;ufferings beyond the grave.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenth.</HI> That the righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;uffer|ings of Chri&s;t in his members are both one; that every man &s;uffers per&s;onally for him&s;elf, with in|expre&s;&s;ible woe and mi&s;ery for &s;ins not repented
<PB N="9" REF="017735_0008_0FA26A89B28D6418">of notwith&s;tanding this union, until final redempti|on.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenth.</HI> They believe Chri&s;t will never make any publick appearance as a &s;ingle per&s;on, but only in his &s;aints: That the judgment day is now begun in that Church.</P>
<P><HI>Fifteenth.</HI> They believe no &s;alvation out of o|bedience to the &s;overeignty of their dominion; That all &s;in which is committed again&s;t God, is done again&s;t them, and mu&s;t be pardoned for Chri&s;t's &s;ake through them, for which confe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be made to them.</P>
<P><HI>Sixteenth.</HI> They believe that their Church is come out of the order of natural generation, to be as Chri&s;t was; that tho&s;e who have wives are as though they had none; that by the&s;e means Hea|ven begins upon earth, and they thereby loo&s;e their &s;en&s;ual or earthly relation to Adam the fir&s;t, and come to be tran&s;parent in their ideas in the bright and heavenly vi&s;ions of God.</P>
<P><HI>Seventeenth.</HI> They hold to a travel and labour for the redemption of departed &s;pirits.</P>
<P>There are other articles le&s;s important which they occa&s;ionally advance, which for brevity's &s;ake mu&s;t be omitted but the above are a &s;ummary of their principles.</P>
<P>The writer will now proceed in order to trace them to that &s;eat of power which produces tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="017735_0009_0FA26A8A5AEA4628">&s;trange operations that are frequent among them. By the &s;ame caution they u&s;e in the fir&s;t introduc|tion of their pro&s;elytes, they carefully lead them by &s;everal degrees into the belief of their tenets, and of con&s;equence into the &s;everal exerci&s;es of their wor&s;hip. They fir&s;tly inculcate a principle of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, as introductory to &s;ome fu|ture knowledge of divine my&s;teries to which they will attain by a &s;trict adherence to Church pre|cepts. They are exhorted not to de&s;pi&s;e (by &s;trict order) the things they under&s;tand not. And being &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome re&s;olution of warfare again&s;t their &s;ins by per&s;onal labours, they are bid to judge of the &s;afety of communion with that &s;o|ciety by the victory they obtain again&s;t predomi|nant vice, not to inquire into principles any fa&s;ter than as they &s;hall come into vi&s;ion by leaving their &s;in.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the human frame and con&s;truction of man is &s;uch, that great effects may be produced merely by, as it were, a mechanical operation on the nerves, they improve them to excite the atten|tion of mankind, as if it were the &s;trange work &s;poken of in Scripture, which &s;hould be brought to pa&s;s in the latter days. They therefore exhort their adherents, with great &s;olemnity in their ad|dre&s;&s;es, to cheri&s;h &s;uch kind of motions upon them|&s;elves as are frequently ob&s;erved on the human body of others, telling them the operations of God's &s;pirit are in &s;cripture &s;aid to be diver&s;e. And that as they become more acquainted with them, although they carry &s;ome outward appear|ance of gro&s;s ab&s;urdities in the eyes of the world,
<PB N="11" REF="017735_0010_0FA26A8B1D8B4350">yet will they a&s;&s;uredly find an inward &s;pirit of piety and holine&s;s running through the whole of their ex|erci&s;es: Tell them that God therefore owns them, and his holy &s;pirit moves them to &s;uch extraordina|ry exta&s;ies of mind and motions of the body. Thus are their pro&s;elytes duped into the belief of &s;omething more than common, and are led to judge of every whim&s;ical pa&s;&s;ion of animal nature, &s;eparate from grace to be a part of their religion, while they at the &s;ame time, through a mi&s;led judgment, condemn the grace of God in the hearts of tho&s;e who make not &s;o much of human pa&s;&s;ion. It has been ob&s;erved that per&s;ons who newly open their minds to this &s;ociety, leave immediately the company of their old neighbours and acquaintances, &s;ome of their old vicious habits, and all their old religion, and experiences, and are cemented into the union of deep delu&s;ion, re&s;igning their former wills to this new mother, to be governed by her, through her elders, tutors and labourers, which of con&s;equence, produce likene&s;s of &s;entiment and rai&s;ed elevation of mind. However my&s;terious it may &s;eem, numberle&s;s in&s;tances can be produced where lyars, &s;wearers, drunkards, extortioners, unclean, unju&s;t, covetous per&s;ons, proud, &s;elf-will|ed, heady, high minded, &amp;c. at lea&s;t many of the&s;e characters have all been brought down to confe&s;s, and ab&s;olutely for a time to leave their ordinary and common vices for the &s;ake of uniting into one general &s;pirit of downright idolatry, crying out with one voice as in <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 34, great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians; or, great is the Elect Mother of the Sha|kers! The&s;e people gain advantage to ri&s;e in autho|rity by judging in matters of con&s;cience; giving
<PB N="12" REF="017735_0011_0FA26A8BD8219CC0">out their precepts; receiving perpetually confe&s;&s;i|on from their converts; elevating their minds in their &s;everal exerci&s;es; reforming them from the common delu&s;ion of ordinary vice for this grand delu&s;ion, &s;till more notoriou&s;ly ab&s;urd, of wor&s;hip|ing the creature, in&s;tead of the Creator, who is God ble&s;&s;ed forevermore. Some have been ready to query if the&s;e operations can be performed with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;upernatural power. The delicacy of an an&s;wer to which requires moderati|on in determining a matter of univer&s;al enquiry. It will be granted however, by what has been alrea|dy written, that great appearances of more than common power may proceed from the union and fellow&s;hip of &s;uch a deluded body of people, who&s;e affections and animal &s;pirits are cemented into a likene&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion and tran&s;port, being bewitched, as it were, or enchanted with the &s;plendid &s;hew of perfection: Should this be the mo&s;t favourable cir|cum&s;tance in regard to that people, and they be ig|norant of any ab&s;olute league, but only among them&s;elves; it is mo&s;t worthy of being truly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from pure and vital religion, and ought to be abhorred and utterly dete&s;ted by all, even as an infringement on the common rights of humanity. For there is a perpetual &s;cene of trembling, quiver|ing, &s;haking, &s;ighing, crying, groaning, &s;creaming, jumping, &s;inging, dancing and turning, which &s;trikes the animal part, operating on the nerves of the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers, in following which the adhe|rent finds an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from favour with them to go into their &s;everal exerci&s;es, to mourn and rejoice with them, to kneel, to leap, and dance, to turn and &s;hake, and &s;ometimes to utter
<PB N="13" REF="017735_0012_0FA26A8CBB5CDA88">forth their unknown mutter, &s;o gibberi&s;h that a per&s;on not deluded would imagine they were a company of madmen, by whom their pa&s;&s;ions in different colours are artfully di&s;played; this they call the gift of new tongues, by which their oppo|&s;ers oftentimes find them&s;elves &s;everely &s;colded at, &s;ometimes mocked, entreated or flattered, accord|ing to the operation of their &s;everal humours, fre|quently gathering round &s;ome one of their own company who is not quite obedient enough for them, like &s;piteful birds in fighting, and peck upon him in their unknown mutter, as if they would pick his fle&s;h from him. If this will not do in &s;uch a ca&s;e of di&s;cipline, the common people are informed of his &s;ecret &s;ins, long before confe&s;&s;ed to the el|ders, and gone before hand to judgment who now begin to hold their di&s;obedient rebel in open deri&s;ion, &s;hewing the anger of God towards him, as they term it. They tell him that God has re|vealed to them that he has been guilty of &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins, that he has never repented of them; for if he had, the&s;e &s;ins would never have come up again to judgment; that he is in danger of falling away; that it is impo&s;&s;ible for their church to lay any thing upon him which is contrary to the will of God. All hands fall to, and ju&s;tify &s;ome in|junction he complains of as a matter of grievance. If his mind is perplexed, and he &s;eeks to know the rea&s;on of particular orders, they entangle him in his difficulty to make him comply with his duty, warning him at his peril not to di&s;pute the autho|rity of the church, not &s;uffering him to enjoy any peace until bewitched with the effect of their di&s;|cipline, he finally gives up his rea&s;on, &s;en&s;e, judg|ment,
<PB N="14" REF="017735_0013_0FA26A8D578B67A0">will and affection, being overcome with their apparent harmony among them&s;elves, and exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity towards him. He then receives double congratulations from their whole &s;ociety, in full rejoicing over him as a &s;inner that is brought to repentance. By which time this conquered one is prepared for new battles, in order to help &s;ubdue the next rebellious wretch who dare di&s;pute the mighty canons of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A particular account of the writer's experience in five different governments is now fitting for the pre&s;s: In which every u&s;eful matter of intelligence concerning the ri&s;e of that people, and their &s;everal advances in this new &s;y&s;tem will &s;oon be publi&s;h|ed in the Second Number.</P>
<P>Some of the principal heads of this people are &s;aid to be born in the town of Manche&s;ter, in the we&s;t of England, and members of We&s;t's &s;eparate church there.&mdash;The names of tho&s;e who have re|&s;ided in Harvard, Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, from May 1781, to February 1782, are <HI>Anna Lee&s;e,</HI> the Mother, <HI>William Lee&s;e,</HI> her natural brother, <HI>John Parkinton,</HI> formerly a Bap|ti&s;t preacher in England, <HI>James Whittiker,</HI> chief &s;peaker in the A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>James Shepherd</HI> &s;aid to have been a merchant in England, be&s;ides two wo|men of that church, &s;even in all: The re&s;t of the European Shakers have &s;till re&s;ided in Ni&s;queunia, above Albany, &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;ettlement there, a|mong whom Elder <HI>Ocknell,</HI> as he is called by that people, is chief.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017735_0014_0FA26A91C6BCE638">
The above Mother and four Elders have had the lead of government at Harvard, over all their adherents for hundreds of miles round them, who have kept up a &s;tore of provi&s;ion, &s;ufficient for eighty or an hundred people at a time; and on their &s;ettlement fir&s;t at Harvard, their meeting was kept up by day and night, chiefly in &s;inging, un|til after they had got &s;ome footing, when it was immediately turned into heavy dancing, generally about forty or fifty men together, and as many women &s;eparate by them&s;elves in different rooms. Their meetings con&s;i&s;ted of a con&s;tant variety of &s;ome newly come, and others ju&s;t ready to leave them;&mdash;&s;ome would &s;tay two, &s;ome &s;ix, &s;ome ten, and &s;ome twenty days on a vi&s;it;&mdash;&s;ome would come twice, &s;ome thrice, &s;ome five, and &s;ome ten times a piece;&mdash;&s;ome would come twenty, &s;ome fifty, &s;ome an hundred, and &s;ome two hundred miles: Be&s;ides they have had labourers con&s;tantly going and coming, making new pro&s;elytes, and confirming their old ones further and further in this millenium &s;tate of their church as they profe&s;s; the whole of which is manife&s;tly done to introduce popery and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power.&mdash;Their meetings generally continued every night until about two o'clock after midnight, and very frequently until the break of day; no di&s;tinction on the &s;abbath, excepting on the account of hard labour.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are generally in&s;tructed to be very indu&s;trious e&s;pecially at their own dwelling places of abode, to bring in their ability to keep up their meeting. Multitudes &s;pend their whole time this way, and are &s;upported by others; they
<PB N="16" REF="017735_0015_0FA26A934018F6A0">generally come, and always go, by order. They vary in their exerci&s;es&mdash;their heavy dancing, as it is called, is performed by a perpetual &s;pringing from the hou&s;e floor, about four inches up and down, both in the men's and women's apartment, moving about as thick as they can crowd, with extraordinary tran&s;port, &s;inging &s;ometimes one at a time, and &s;ometimes more than one, making a perfect charm.</P>
<P>This elevation draws upon the nerves &s;o as that they have intervals of &s;huddering as if they were in a &s;trong &s;it of the ague.&mdash;They &s;ometimes clap hands and leap &s;o as to &s;trike the joyce above their heads. They throw off their out&s;ide garments in the&s;e exerci&s;es, and &s;pend their &s;trength very cheerfully this way; their chief &s;peaker of|tentimes calls for their attention, when they all &s;top and hear &s;ome harrangue, and then fall to dancing again. Sometimes when they are weary of this heavy exerci&s;e of body, they &s;top and fall on their knees and make a &s;ound like the roar|ing of many waters, in groans and cries to God, as they &s;ay, for the wicked world who per&s;ecute them.</P>
<P>There might be written a volume if it were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle their character that way; but the writing will be brief, therefore &s;hall conclude this fir&s;t number by reque&s;ting tho&s;e who are ma&s;ters of language to excu&s;e his manner of &s;tyle, as not being reviewed by any man of learning, but wrote chiefly at fir&s;t hand, and committed to the pre&s;s, promi&s;ing to accept of the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the next number&mdash;Warning all men to guard again&s;t
