<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BY <HI>&s;lavery</HI> I mean dome&s;tic &s;lavery, or that of a &s;ervant to a ma&s;ter. A late ingenious writer well ob&s;erves, "The variety of forms in which &s;lavery appears, makes it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to convey a ju&s;t notion of it, by way of de|finition. There are however certain pro|perties which have accompanied &s;lavery in mo&s;t places, whereby it is ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that mild dome&s;tic <HI>&s;ervice</HI> which obtains in our own country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Hargrave's</HI> plea for <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> the negro.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Slavery</HI> imports an obligation of per|petual &s;ervice, an obligation which only
<PB N="4" REF="013762_0003_0F91A706A8B0C368">the con&s;ent of the ma&s;ter can di&s;&s;olve. Neither in &s;ome countries can the ma&s;ter him&s;elf di&s;&s;olve it, without the con&s;ent of judges appointed by law. It generally gives the ma&s;ter an arbitrary power of any correction not affecting life or limb.&mdash;Sometimes even the&s;e are expo&s;ed to his will: or protected only by a fine, or &s;ome &s;light puni&s;hment, too in&s;iconderable to re&s;train a ma&s;ter of an har&s;h temper. It creates an incapacity of acquiring any thing, except for the ma&s;ter's benefit. It allows the ma&s;ter to alienate the &s;lave, in the &s;ame manner as his cows and hor&s;es. La&s;tly, it de&s;cends in its full extent from parent to child, even to the late&s;t gene|ration.</P>
<P N="3">3. The beginning of this may be dated from the remote&s;t period, of which we have an account in hi&s;tory. It commenced in the barbarous &s;tate of &s;ociety, and in proce&s;s of time &s;pread into all nations. It prevailed particularly among the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the antient <HI>Germans:</HI> And was tran&s;mitted by them to the various kingdoms and &s;tates, which aro&s;e out of the ruins of the <HI>Roman</HI> em|pire. But after chri&s;tianity prevailed, it gradually fell into decline in almo&s;t all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> This great change began in <HI>Spain,</HI> about the end of the eighth cen|tury:
<PB N="5" REF="013762_0004_0F91A7070AE440F8">And was become general in mo&s;t other kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> before the mid|dle of the fourteenth.</P>
<P N="4">4. From this time &s;lavery was nearly extinct, till the commencement of the &s;ix|teenth century, when the di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> and of the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> gave occa&s;ion to the revi|val of it. It took its ri&s;e from the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> who to &s;upply the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with men, to cultivate their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America,</HI> procured negroes from <HI>Africa,</HI> whom they &s;old for &s;laves to the <HI>American</HI> Spaniards. This began in the year 1508, when they imported the fir&s;t negroes into <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> In 1540 <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, then king of <HI>Spain,</HI> determined to put an end to <HI>negro-&s;lavery:</HI> Giving po&s;itive orders. That all the negro &s;laves in the Spani&s;h dominions &s;hould be &s;et free. And this was accordingly done by <HI>Laga&s;ca,</HI> whom he &s;ent and impowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to labour for their ma&s;ters. But &s;oon after <HI>Laga&s;ca</HI> re|turned to <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;lavery returned and flou|ri&s;hed as before. Afterwards other na|tions, as they acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America,</HI> followed the examples of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and &s;lavery has now taken deep root in mo&s;t of our <HI>American</HI> colonies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="013762_0005_0F91A707C243E138">
II. Such is the nature of &s;lavery: Such the beginning of negro-&s;lavery in <HI>America.</HI> But &s;ome may de&s;ire to know, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought? What &s;ort of men, of what temper and behaviour are they in their own country? And in what manner they are generally procured, carried to, and treated in <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, What kind of country is that from whence they are brought? Is it &s;o remarkably horrid, dreary and barren, that it is a kindne&s;s to deliver them out of it? I believe many have apprehended &s;o: But it is an entire mi&s;take, if we may give credit to tho&s;e who have lived many years therein, and could have no motive to mi&s;repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That part of <HI>Africa</HI> whence the ne|groes are brought, commonly known by the name of <HI>Guinea,</HI> extends along the coa&s;t, in the whole, between three and four thou&s;and miles. From the river <HI>Se|negal,</HI> (&s;eventeen degrees north of the line) to Cape <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> it contains &s;even hundred miles. Thence it runs ea&s;tward about fifteen hundred miles, including the <HI>Grain-Coa&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Ivory-Coa&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Cold-Coa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Slave Coa&s;t,</HI> with the large king|dom of <HI>Benin.</HI> From thence it runs &s;outh|ward, about twelve hundred miles, and
<PB N="7" REF="013762_0006_0F91A70875186840">contains the kingdoms of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>An|gola.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Concerning the fir&s;t, the <HI>Senegal-Coa&s;t,</HI> Mons. <HI>Brue,</HI> who lived there &s;ixteen years, after de&s;cribing its fruitfulne&s;s near the &s;ea, &s;ays, "The farther you go from the &s;ea, the more fruitful and well im|proved is the country, abounding in pul&s;e, Indian corn, and various fruits. Here are va&s;t meadows, which feed large herds of great and &s;mall cattle. And the villages which lie thick, &s;hew the country is well peopled." And again: "I was &s;urprized, to &s;ee the land &s;o well cultivated; &s;carce a &s;pot day un-improved: The low lands divided by &s;mall canals, were all &s;owed with rice: The higher grounds were plant|ed with Indian corn, and peas of different &s;orts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty and very cheap, as are all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life."</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Ivory Coa&s;t,</HI> we learn from eye witne&s;&s;es, that the &s;oil is in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation.&mdash;Fi&s;h is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are numerous, and the trees loaded with fruit.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Gold-Coa&s;t</HI> and <HI>Slave-Coa&s;t,</HI> all who have &s;een it agree, is exceeding fruit|ful and plea&s;ant, producing va&s;t quantities
<PB N="8" REF="013762_0007_0F91A70A6DE498A0">of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm-wine, and oil, and fi&s;h in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. The very &s;ame account is given us of the &s;oil and produce of the kingdoms of <HI>Benin, Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola.</HI>&mdash;From all which it appears, That <HI>Guinea</HI> in general, far from being an horrid, dreary, barren country, is one of the mo&s;t fruitful, as well as the mo&s;t plea&s;ant countries in the known world. It is &s;aid indeed to be unhealthy. And &s;o it is to &s;trangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabi|tants.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such is the country from which the negroes are brought. We come next to enquire, What &s;ort of men they are, of what temper and behaviour, not in our plantations, but in their native country. And here likewi&s;e the &s;ure&s;t way is to take our account from eye and ear witne&s;&s;es. Now tho&s;e who have lived in the <HI>Senegal</HI> country ob&s;erve, it is inhabited by three nations, the <HI>Jalofs, Fulis,</HI> and <HI>Mandingos.</HI> The king of the <HI>Jalofs</HI> has under him &s;e|veral mini&s;ters, who a&s;&s;i&s;t in the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice. The chief ju&s;tice goes in cir|cuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine controver&s;ies. And the viceroy goes with him, to in&s;pect the behaviour of the <HI>Alkadi,</HI> or Governor
<PB N="9" REF="013762_0008_0F91A70B05B00630">of each village. The <HI>Fulis</HI> are a numerous people; the &s;oil of their country repre&s;ent|ed as rich, affording large harve&s;ts, and the people laborious and good farmers: Of &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Fuli</HI> blacks who dwelt on the river <HI>Gambia, William Moor</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> factor gives a very favourable account.&mdash;He &s;ays, they are governed by their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink any thing &s;tronger than water, being &s;trict <HI>Mahometans.</HI> The government is ea&s;y, becau&s;e the people are of a good and quiet di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;o well in&s;tructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the abomina|tion of all.&mdash;They de&s;ire no more land than they u&s;e, which they cultivate with great care and indu&s;try: If any of them are known to be made &s;laves by the white men they all join to redeem them. They not only &s;upport all that are old, or blind, or lame among them&s;elves; but have frequently &s;upplied the nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>Mandingas,</HI> when they were di&s;tre&s;t by famine.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Mandingos,</HI> &s;ays Mon&s;. <HI>Brue,</HI> are rigid <HI>Mahometans,</HI> drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are indu&s;trious and laborious, keeping their ground well cul|tivated, and breeding a good &s;tock of cat|tle. Every town has a governor, and he
<PB N="10" REF="013762_0009_0F91A70B77A99E58">appoints the labour of the people. The men work the ground de&s;igned for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.&mdash;He afterwards divides the corn and rice among them: And decides all quarrels if any ari&s;e. All the Mahometan negroes con&s;tantly go to public prayers thrice a day: there being a prie&s;t in every village, who regularly calls them together: Some authors &s;ay, it is &s;urprizing to &s;ee the atten|tion and reverence which they ob&s;erve during their wor&s;hip.&mdash;The&s;e three nati|ons practi&s;e &s;everal trades; they have &s;miths, &s;adlers, potters and weavers. And they are very ingenious at their &s;everal occupations.&mdash;Their &s;miths not only make all the in&s;truments of iron, which they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e, but likewi&s;e work many things neatly in gold and &s;ilver. It is chiefly the women and chil|dren who weave &s;ine cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black.</P>
<P N="8">8. It was of the&s;e parts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> that Mon&s;. <HI>Adan&s;on,</HI> corre&s;pondent of the royal academy of &s;ciences at <HI>Paris</HI> from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account, both as to the country and people. "Which way &s;oever I turned my eyes, I beheld a per|fect image of pure nature: An agreeable &s;olitude, bounded on every &s;ide by a charming land&s;cape; the rural &s;ituation
<PB N="11" REF="013762_0010_0F91A70EEBE20240">of cottages, in the mid&s;t of trees; the ea&s;e and quietne&s;s of the negroes, reclined un|der the &s;hade of the &s;preading foliage, with the &s;implicity of their dre&s;s and man|ners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our fir&s;t parents, and I &s;eemed to contemplate the world in its primitive &s;tate. They are generally-&s;peaking, very good natured, &s;ociable and obliging. I was not a little plea&s;ed with my very fir&s;t reception, and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be a con&s;iderable abate|ment made, in the accounts we have of the &s;avage character of the <HI>Africans.</HI>" He adds, "It is amazing that an illiterate people &s;hould rea&s;on &s;o pertinently con|cerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt, but that with proper in&s;tru|ments, they would become excellent a&s;tro|nomers."</P>
<P N="9">9. The inhabitants of the <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Ivory-Coa&s;t</HI> are repre&s;ented by tho&s;e that deal with them, as &s;en&s;ible, courteous, and the faire&s;t traders on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea.</HI> They rarely drink to exce&s;s: If any do, they are &s;everely puni&s;hed by the king's order. They are &s;eldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commony end the di&s;|pute amicably.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver-Coa&s;t</HI> likewi&s;e, when they are not artfully
<PB N="12" REF="013762_0011_0F91A70FEBD396D8">incen&s;ed again&s;t each other, live in great union and friend&s;hip, being generally well-tempered, civil, tractable, and ready to help any that need it. In particular, the natives of the kingdom of <HI>Whidah</HI> are civil, kind, and obliging to &s;trangers.&mdash;And they are the mo&s;t gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good man|ners towards each other. The inferiors pay great re&s;pect to their &s;uperiors:&mdash;So wives to their hu&s;bands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably indu&s;trious: All are con&s;tantly employ'd; the men in agriculture, the women in &s;pinning and weaving cotton.</P>
<P N="10">10. The <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Slave Coa&s;ts</HI> are divid|ed into &s;everal di&s;tricts, &s;ome governed by kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own town or vil|lage, and prevent or appea&s;e tumults.&mdash;They puni&s;h murder and adultery &s;e|verely; very frequently with death.&mdash;Theft and robbery are puni&s;hed by a fine proportionable to the goods that were taken.&mdash;All the natives of this coa&s;t, though heathens, believe there is one GOD, the author of them and all things. They appear likewi&s;e to have a confu&s;ed appre|hen&s;ion of a future &s;tate. And accord|ingly every town and village has a place of public wor&s;hip.&mdash;It is remarkable that
<PB N="13" REF="013762_0012_0F91A7100FFA1E50">they have no beggars among them: Such is the care of the chief men, in every city and village, to provide &s;ome ea&s;y labour, even for the old and weak. Some are employ'd in blowing the &s;miths bellows; others in pre&s;&s;ing palm-oil; others in grinding of colours. If they are too weak even for this, they &s;ell provi&s;ions in the market.</P>
<P N="11">11. The accounts we have of the na|tives of the kingdom of <HI>Benin</HI> is, that they are a rea&s;onable and good-natured people, &s;incere and inoffen&s;ive, and do no inju&s;tice either to one another or to &s;trangers.&mdash;They are civil and courteous: If you make them a pre&s;ent, they endeavour to repay it double. And if they are tru&s;ted, till the &s;hip returns next year, they are &s;ure hone&s;tly to pay the whole debt.&mdash;Theft is puni&s;hed among them, altho' not with the &s;ame &s;everity as murder. If a man and woman of any quality, are taken in adultery, they are certain to be put to death, and their bodies thrown on a dunghill, and left a prey to wild bea&s;ts. They are punctually ju&s;t and hone&s;t in their dealings; and are al&s;o very charitable: The king and the great lords taking care to employ all that are capable of any work. And tho&s;e that are utterly helple&s;s they keep for GOD's &s;ake; &s;o that here al&s;o are
<PB N="14" REF="013762_0013_0F91A710B2013560">no beggars. The inhabitants of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola</HI> are generally a quiet people. They di&s;cover a good under&s;tanding, and be|have in a friendly manner to &s;trangers, being of a mild temper and an affable car|riage.&mdash;Upon the whole therefore the negroes who inhabit the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> from the river <HI>Senegal</HI> to the &s;outhern bounds of <HI>Angola,</HI> are &s;o far from being the &s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, bruti&s;h, lazy barba|rians, the fierce, cruel, perfidious &s;avages they have been de&s;cribed, that on the contrary, they are repre&s;ented by them who had no motive to flatter them, as re|markably &s;en&s;ible, con&s;idering the few advantages they have for improving their under&s;tanding:&mdash;As very indu&s;trious, perhaps more &s;o than any other natives of &s;o warm a climate.&mdash;As fair, ju&s;t and hone&s;t in their dealings, unle&s;s where whitemen have taught them to be otherwi&s;e:&mdash;And as far more mild, friendly and kind to &s;trangers, than any of our forefathers were. Our forefathers! Where &s;hall we find at this day, among the fair-faced natives of <HI>Europe,</HI> a nation generally practi&s;ing the ju&s;tice mercy, and truth, which are related of the&s;e poor black <HI>Africans?</HI> Suppo&s;e the preced|ing accounts are true, (which I &s;ee no rea|&s;on or pretence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> doubt of) and we may
<PB N="15" REF="013762_0014_0F91A7116E3EE1E8">leave <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to &s;eek genuine hone&s;ty in <HI>Benin, Congo,</HI> or <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. We have now &s;een, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought: And what &s;ort of men (even whitemen being the judges) they were in their own country. Enquire we, Thirdly, In what manner are they generally pro|cured, carried to, and treated in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> In what manner are they pro|cured? Part of them by fraud. Captains of &s;hips from time to time, have invited negroes to come on board, and then car|ried them away. But far more have been procured by force. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;tians land|ing upon their coa&s;ts, &s;eized as many as they found, men, women and children, and tran&s;ported them to <HI>America.</HI> It was about 1551, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> began trading to <HI>Guinea:</HI> At fir&s;t, for gold and elephants teeth, but &s;oon after, for men. In 1566, Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> &s;ailed with two &s;hips to Cape <HI>Verd,</HI> where he &s;ent eighty men on &s;hore to catch negroes. But the natives flying, they fell farther down, and there &s;et the men on &s;hore, "to burn their towns and take the inhabitants." But they met with &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance, that they had &s;even men killed, and took but ten negroes. So they went &s;till farther down,
<PB N="16" REF="013762_0015_0F91A71249B2D578">till having taken enough, they proceeded to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;old them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it may be well to give a particular ac|count of that tran&s;action in the very words in which it is tran&s;mitted to us by early hi&s;torians, as it is a clear proof, that it was &s;olely from a de&s;ire of gain that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t undertook to &s;eize and bring the unhappy <HI>Africans</HI> from their native country; and is a clear and po&s;itive refutation of tho&s;e fal&s;e arguments frequently advanced in vin|dication of the &s;lave trade, viz. That the fir&s;t pur|cha&s;e of negro &s;laves by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was from mo|tives of compa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">, with views of &s;aving the lives of &s;ome of tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">acks who being taken pri&s;oners in battle, would, if not thus purcha&s;ed, have been &s;acrificed to the revenge of their conquerors: but this plea is manife&s;tly fal&s;e; from all the accounts we have of the di&s;po&s;ition of the negroes in tho&s;e early times, they appear to have been an innocent people, gentle and ea&s;y in their nature; rather aver&s;e to war, as is the general di&s;po&s;ition of the natives of the&s;e warm climates; till being corrupt|ed by an intercour&s;e with the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and &s;timu|lated by the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, they were induced to join them in their cruel deprada|tions again&s;t their unhappy countrymen. The ac|count given of that tran&s;action by <HI>Thomas Lediard</HI> in his naval hi&s;tory, at page 141, is in the follow|ing words: <Q>That Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> in his &s;everal voyages to the <HI>Canary</HI> i&s;lands, under&s;tanding that negroes were a very good commodity in <HI>Hi&s;pani|ola,</HI> (then &s;ettling by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) and that they were ea&s;y to be had in great numbers on the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea.</HI> Having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his mind to his friends, he &s;oon found adventurers for his undertaking; among&s;t whom were Sir <HI>Lionel Docket,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Lodge,</HI> and others: and having fitted out three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, manned only with 100 men, he departed from the coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1562, and &s;ailed fir&s;t to <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> where he took in &s;everal refre&s;hments; from thence to the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where he got in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, partly by the &s;word, and by other means, up|wards of three hundred of the natives, be&s;ides &s;everal commodities which that country afford|ed: with this booty he &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where he di&s;po&s;ed of his negroes. Two years after, he went another voyage on the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> there he &s;taid &s;e|veral days at the i&s;land <HI>Sabula,</HI> where every day they took &s;ome of the inhabitants; burning and ravaging their towns: when having compleated their number of negroes, they &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></Q></NOTE>.</P>

When the ve&s;&s;els arrive at their de&s;tined port, the Negroes are again expo&s;ed naked, to the eyes of all that flock together, and the examination of their purcha&s;ers: Then they are &s;epa|rated to the plantations of their &s;everal ma&s;ters, to &s;ee each other no more.

<P>The author of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> wrote a|bout the year 1740, in his account of the &s;ufferings of the negroes, &s;ays, The people of that i&s;land have indeed the &s;evere&s;t ways of puni&s;hing; no country exceeds them in a barbarous treatment of their &s;laves, or in the cruel methods by which they are put to death. After confirming what is before &s;aid he adds, "They &s;tarve them to death, with a loaf hanging over their mouths. I have &s;een the&s;e unfortunate wretches gnaw the fle&s;h off their &s;houlders, and expire in all the frightful agonies of one under the mo&s;t horrible tortures.

It is no wonder, (adds this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">) if the horrid pain of &s;uch inhuman tortures incline them to rebel." The &s;ame author gives us extracts of &s;ome of the laws of <HI>Jamaica</HI> relating to the puni&s;hment of &s;laves, taken as he &s;ays, from a general collection of the plantation laws, the printed &s;tatutes, or the &s;ecre|tary's-office, viz.</P>
<P>"If any &s;lave by puni&s;hment from his owner for running away, or other offence, &s;uffer in life or limb, none &s;hall be liable to the law for the &s;ame; but who&s;oever &s;hall kill a &s;lave out of wilfulne&s;s, wan|tonne&s;s, or bloody mindedne&s;s, &s;hall &s;uffer three months impri&s;onment, and pay fifty pounds to the owner of the &s;lave.

<P>"Tho&s;e that go out in parties to reduce the negroes, &s;hall receive from the trea&s;urer for every rebellious negro that &s;hall be killed, bringing in his head to any ju&s;tice, forty pounds; for every negro taken and brought in alive, and not maimed, ten pounds, to be paid by the owner, who is hereby obliged under the penalty of fifty pounds, to tran&s;|port &s;uch &s;lave &s;o taken; and in ca&s;e the owner cannot be found, then the trea&s;urer &s;hall pay the ten pounds, receive the &s;lave, &s;ell and tran&s;port him, and retain the produce to be employed in the &s;aid &s;ervice."</P>

<P>It is alledged by the planters in excu&s;e for the&s;e unnatural, the&s;e mon&s;trous cruelties, that the greate&s;t &s;everity, the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the management of &s;laves, on account of tho&s;e train of vices which &s;lavery nece&s;&s;arily introduces. A late author remarks how &s;hocking it is to think that tho&s;e unhappy victims mu&s;t from the nature of the thing become danger|ous and refactory, in proportion to the greatne&s;s and genero&s;ity of their minds.</P>
<P>Can there be a more dangerous maxim, than that nece&s;&s;ity is a plea for inju&s;tice? For who &s;hall fix the degree of this nece&s;&s;ity? What villain &s;o atrocious who may not urge this excu&s;e? or as <HI>Milton</HI> expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;</P>

What account will in future &s;tates of exi&s;tence, be given to the father of the family of mankind, for the lives of &s;o many of our fellow men &s;o inhumanly murdered.

Nearly allied to this is that law of <HI>Vir|ginia:</HI> "After proclamation is i&s;&s;ued a|gain&s;t &s;laves that run away, it is lawful for any per&s;on what&s;oever to KILL AND DESTROY &s;uch &s;laves, by SUCH WAYS AND MEANS AS HE SHALL THINK FIT.</P>

<P N="1">IV. 1. This is the plain, un-aggravat|ed matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our <HI>African</HI> &s;laves are procured: Such the manner wherein they are remov|ed from their native land, and wherein they are treaed in our Plantations. I would now enquire, whether the&s;e things can be defended, on the principles of even hea|then hone&s;ty? Whether they can be recon|ciled (&s;etting the Bible out of the que&s;tion) with any degree of either ju&s;tice or mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. The grand plea is, "They are au|thorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things? Can
<PB N="34" REF="013762_0033_0F91A725E5748428">it turn darkne&s;s into light, or evil into good? By no means. Notwith&s;tanding ten thou&s;and laws, right is right, and wrong is wrong &s;till. There mu&s;t &s;till remain an e&s;&s;ential difference between ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice, cruelty and mercy. So that &s;till I a&s;k, Who can reconcile this treatment of the negroes, fir&s;t and la&s;t, with either mercy or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Where is the ju&s;tice of inflicting the &s;evere&s;t evils, on tho&s;e that have done us no wrong? Of depriving tho&s;e that ne|ver injured us in word or deed, of every comfort of life? Of tearing them from their native country, and depriving them of liberty it&s;elf? To which an <HI>Angolan,</HI> has the &s;ame natural right as an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> and on which he &s;ets as high a value? Yea where is the ju&s;tice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffen&s;ive men? Murdering thou&s;ands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own countrymen: Many thou&s;ands, year after year, on &s;hipboard, and then ca&s;t|ing them like dung into the &s;ea! And tens of thou&s;ands in that cruel &s;lavery, to which they are &s;o unju&s;tly reduced?</P>
<P N="3">3. But waving, for the pre&s;ent, all other con&s;iderations, I &s;trike at the root of this complicated villainy. I ab&s;olute|ly deny all &s;lave-holding to be con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="35" REF="013762_0034_0F91A7289F7BFF60">with any degreee of even natural ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I cannot place this in a clearer light, than that great ornament of his profe&s;|&s;ion, judge <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> has already done. Part of his words are as follows:</P>
<P>"The three origins of the right of &s;lavery a&s;&s;igned by <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> are all built upon fal&s;e foundations. 1. Slavery is &s;aid to ari&s;e from captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captive, if he &s;pares that, has then a right to deal with him as he plea&s;es. But this is untrue, it taken generally, That by the law of nations, a man has a right to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular ca&s;es in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for &s;elf-defence. And it is plain, this ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;ince he did not kill him, but made him pri&s;oner. War it&s;elf is ju&s;ti|fiable only on principles of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion. Therefore it gives us no right o|ver pri&s;oners, but to hinder their hurt|ing us by confining them. Much le&s;s can it give a right to torture, or kill, or even to en&s;lave an enemy when the war is over. Since therefore the right of mak|ing our pri&s;oners &s;laves, depends on a &s;uppo&s;ed right of &s;laughter, that found|dation failing, the con&s;equence which is drawn from it mu&s;t fail likewi&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="013762_0035_0F91A728C4B32BB8">
"It is &s;aid, Secondly, &s;lavery may be|gin, by one man's &s;elling him&s;elf to ano|ther. And it is true, a man may &s;ell him|&s;elf to work for another: But he cannot &s;ell him&s;elf to be a &s;lave, as above defined. Every &s;ale implies an equivalent given to the &s;eller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewi&s;e, with the very price which he &s;eems to receive, devolves <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> to his ma&s;ter, the in&s;tant he becomes his &s;lave: In this ca&s;e therefore the buyer gives nothing, and the &s;eller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a &s;ale be, which de&s;troys the very principles upon which all &s;ales are founded?"</P>
<P>"We are told, Thirdly, that men may be <HI>born &s;laves,</HI> by being the children of &s;laves. But this being built on the two former rights, mu&s;t fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor contract can by the plain law of nature and rea&s;on, reduce the parent to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, much le&s;s can they reduce the offspring." It clearly follows, that all &s;lavery is as ir|reconcileable to ju&s;tice as to mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. That &s;lave-holding is utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with mercy, is almo&s;t too plain to need a proof. Indeed it is &s;aid, "That the&s;e negroes being pri&s;oners of war, our
<PB N="37" REF="013762_0036_0F91A729726A5B58">captains and factors buy them merely to &s;ave them from being put to death. And is not this mercy?" I an&s;wer, 1. Did Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> and many others, &s;eize upon men, women and children, who were at peace in their own fields or hou&s;es, merely to &s;ave them from death? 2. Was it to &s;ave them from death, that they knock'd out the brains of tho&s;e they could not bring away? 3. Who occa&s;ioned and fomented tho&s;e wars, wherein the&s;e poor creatures were taken pri&s;oners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not them&s;elves? They know in their own con&s;cience it was, if they have any con&s;cience left. But 4. To bring the matter to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. Can they &s;ay before GOD, That they ever took a &s;ingle voyage, or bought a &s;ingle negro from this motive? They cannot. They well know, to get money, not to &s;ave lives, was the whole and &s;ole &s;pring of their motions.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if this manner of procuring and treating negroes is not con&s;i&s;tent either with mercy or ju&s;tice, yet there is a plea for it which every man of bu&s;ine&s;s will acknowledge to be quite &s;ufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent &s;tate&s;|man in the lobby of the hou&s;e of com|mons,
<PB N="38" REF="013762_0037_0F91A72B5F1440C8">&s;aid, "You have been long talking about ju&s;tice and equity. Pray which is this bill? Equity or ju&s;tice?" He an&s;wer|ed, very &s;hort, and plain, "D&mdash;n ju&s;tice: It is nece&s;&s;ity." Here al&s;o the &s;lave-holder fixes his foot: Here he re&s;ts the &s;trength of his cau&s;e. "If it is not quite right, yet it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o: There is an ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for it. It is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould procure &s;laves: And when we have procured them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e them with &s;e|verity, con&s;idering their &s;tupidity, &s;tub|bornne&s;s and wickedne&s;s."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, You &s;tumble at the thre&s;hold: I deny that villany is ever nece&s;&s;ary. It is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould ever be nece&s;|&s;ary, for any rea&s;onable creature to violate all the laws of ju&s;tice, mercy, and truth. No circum&s;tances can make it nece&s;&s;ary for a man to bur&s;t in &s;under all the ties of humanity. It can never be nece&s;&s;ary for a rational being to &s;ink him&s;elf below a brute. A man can be under no nece&s;&s;ity, of degrading him&s;elf into a wolf. The ab&s;urdity of the &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;o glaring, that one would wonder any one can help &s;eeing it.</P>
<P N="6">6. This in general. But to be more particular, I a&s;k, 1. What is nece&s;&s;ary? And, &s;econdly, To what end? It may be be an&s;wered, "The whole method now
<PB N="39" REF="013762_0038_0F91A72BB92F38A0">u&s;ed by the original purcha&s;ers of negroes, is nece&s;&s;ary to the furni&s;hing our colonies yearly with an hundred thou&s;and &s;laves." I grant, this is nece&s;&s;ary to that end. But how is that end nece&s;&s;ary? How will you prove it nece&s;&s;ary, that one hundred, that one of tho&s;e &s;laves &s;hould be procured? "Why, it is nece&s;&s;ary to my gaining an hundred thou&s;and pounds." Perhaps &s;o: But how is <HI>this</HI> nece&s;&s;ary? It is very po&s;|&s;ible you might be both a better and an happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I deny that your gaining one thou&s;and is nece&s;&s;ary, either to your pre&s;ent or eternal happine&s;s. "But however you mu&s;t allow, the&s;e &s;laves are nece&s;&s;ary for the cultivation of our i&s;lands; ina&s;much as white men are not able to labour in hot climates <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is not propo&s;ed to remove the negroes from labouring in the &s;everal provinces and i&s;lands where they are now employed; in order to employ white men in their &s;tead, what is propo&s;ed, is only to pre|vent any farther import of negroes, except tho&s;e who may come voluntarily and in a free condition; and to fall upon &s;uch ju&s;t regulations and proper encouragement with re&s;pect to tho&s;e already a|mong&s;t us, that from dangerous grudging &s;laves, they may become willing hearted labourers, who having an intere&s;t in the peace and welfare of the country, will be parties in its &s;trength and &s;upport. But whil&s;t deficiencies by the death of the labouring &s;laves can be &s;o ea&s;ily made up by the continual fre&s;h imports from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the planters find it cheaper to make new purcha&s;es than to rai&s;e the children, or &s;pare and cheri&s;h the parents of tho&s;e already in their &s;ervice, little amendment can be expected in the hard&s;hip they are put to, and the cruelties exerci&s;ed upon them. Surely the number already in our colonies and i&s;lands, which on a calculation made four or five years pa&s;t, was be|tween eight and nine hundred thou&s;and, be&s;ides that there has' been a va&s;t number, &s;aid to be about an hundred thou&s;and &s;ince yearly imported: all the&s;e, with their increa&s;e, if well u&s;ed, would certainly be &s;ufficient to perform all nece&s;&s;ary la|bour.
<P>If an end was put to the import of negroes, and the odious and cruel di&s;tinction of ma&s;ter and &s;laves, with all its attendant horrors &s;hould cea&s;e, many labouring people from <HI>Europe,</HI> who are now di&s;|couraged from an appren&s;ion of being put on a level with &s;laves, would probably be willing to come ever and engage in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>John Miller,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of law at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> in his late <HI>ob&s;ervations concerning di&s;tinction of ranks in &s;ociety,</HI> ob&s;erves, "That the &s;lavery e&s;tabli&s;hed in our co|lonies is an object of great importance, and is at|tended with difficulties which cannot be ea&s;ily re|moved. It has been thought that the manage|ment of our plantations requires a labour in which free men would not be willing to engage, and which the white people are from their con&s;titution in|capable of performing. How far this opinion is well founded according to the pre&s;ent maimer of labouring in that part of the world, &s;eems difficult to determine, as it has never been properly examin|ed by tho&s;e who are in a condition to a&s;certain the facts in que&s;tion. But there is ground to believe, that the in&s;titution of &s;lavery is the chief circum|&s;tance that has prevented tho&s;e contrivances to &s;horten and facilitate the more laborious employ|ments of the people, which takes place in other coun|tries, where freedom has been introduced. With regard to the planting of &s;ugar, experiments have been made in &s;ome of the i&s;lands, from which it ap|pears, that in &s;ome &s;pecies of cultivation, cattle might be employed with advantage, and that the number of &s;laves might be greatly dimini&s;hed. But the&s;e experiments have been little regarded, in op|po&s;ition to the former u&s;age, and in oppo&s;ition to a lucrative branch of trade which the&s;e innova&s;ions would in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troy. At any rate, the intere&s;t of our colonies &s;eems to demand, that the negroes &s;hould be better treated, and even that they &s;hould be rai&s;ed to a better condition&mdash;The author of a late elegant account of our <HI>American</HI> &s;ettle|ments, has propo&s;ed, that &s;mall wages &s;hould be given them, as an encouragement to indu&s;try. If this mea&s;ure were once begun, it is probable that the ma&s;ter would &s;oon find the utility of pu&s;hing it to a greater extent. Nothing can appear more a&s;toni&s;hing than the little attention that has hitherto been paid to any improvement of this nature, after the good effects of them have been &s;o fully illu&s;trat|ed in the ca&s;e of the villains in <HI>Euro&s;e.</HI> At the &s;ame time, it affords a curious &s;pectacle to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame people who talk in &s;o high a &s;train of political liberty, and who con&s;ider the privilege of impo&s;ing their own taxes, as one of the unalien|able rights of mankind, &s;hould make no &s;cruple of reducing a great proportion of the inhabitants into circum&s;tances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almo&s;t of every right what&s;oever. Fortune, perhaps never produced a &s;ituation more calculated to ridicule a grave and even a liberal hypothe&s;is, or to &s;how how little the conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> is at bottom directed by any philo&s;ophical principles."</P>
<P>We have accounts from <HI>England</HI> of &s;ome regula|tions that have taken place in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> colonies, which do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> much honour, and are cer|tainly worthy our imitation; they are to the follow|ing effect:&mdash;"As &s;oon as a &s;lave is landed, his name, price, &amp;c. are regi&s;tered in a public regi&s;ter, and the ma&s;ter is obliged by law, to allow him <HI>one working day</HI> in every week to him&s;elf, be&s;ides &s;undays: &s;o that if the &s;lave chu&s;es to work for his ma&s;ter on that day, he receives the wages of a freeman for it; and whatever he gains by his labour on that day, is &s;o &s;ecured to him by law, that the ma&s;ter cannot deprive him of it. As &s;oon as the &s;lave is able to purcha&s;e <HI>another working day,</HI> the ma&s;ter is obliged to &s;ell it to him at a proportion|able price, viz. one fifth part of his original co&s;t, and &s;o likewi&s;e the remaining four days at the &s;ame rate, as &s;oon as the &s;lave is able to redeem them; after which <HI>he is ab&s;olutely free.</HI>" This is &s;uch en|couragement to indu&s;try, that even the mo&s;t in|dolent would be tempted to exert them&s;elves.

But, Secondly, the &s;uppo&s;ition on which

<PB N="42" REF="013762_0041_0F91A7305542DB18">that the &s;ummer heat in <HI>Georgia,</HI> is frequently equal to that in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> yea to that under the line.

But you well know, how populous, how fruitful, how plea&s;ant it was a few years ago. You know the people were not &s;tupid, not wanting in &s;en&s;e, con&s;idering the few means of improvement they en|joyed. Neither did you find them &s;avage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or unkind to &s;trangers. On the contrary, they were in mo&s;t parts a &s;en&s;ible and ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and remarkably fair and ju&s;t in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own coun|trymen, to tear away from this lovely country; part by &s;tealth, part by force, part made captives in tho&s;e wars, which you rai&s;e or foment on purpo&s;e. You have &s;een them torn away, children from

You have drag|ged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their na|tive &s;hore. You have forced them into your &s;hips like an herd of &s;wine, them who had &s;ouls immortal as your own: (Only &s;ome of them have leaped into the &s;ea, and re&s;olutely &s;tayed under water, till they could &s;uffer no more from you.) You have &s;towed them together as clo&s;e as ever they could lie, without any regard either to decency or convenience.&mdash;And when many of them had been poi&s;oned by foul air, or had &s;unk under various hard&s;hips, you have &s;een their remains delivered to the deep, till the &s;ea &s;hould give up his dead. You have carried the &s;urvivors into the vile&s;t &s;lavery, never to end but with life: Such &s;lavery as is not found among the <HI>Turks</HI> at <HI>Algiers,</HI> no, nor among the heathens in <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>The fir&s;t is taken from the late writings of <HI>Edward Bancroft,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phy&s;ician, who re&s;ided &s;ome years in that part of <HI>America,</HI> called <HI>Dutch Guiana,</HI> which in|cludes the &s;everal &s;ettlements of <HI>Surinam, Barbices, Demarara,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><PB N="59" REF="013762_0058_0F91A743B471B090">
The <HI>French</HI> author appears to have been in a very different &s;ituation; he was an officer belonging to the troops quartered in the i&s;land <HI>Mauritus,</HI> now called <HI>The I&s;le of France,</HI> who not reaping any advantage from the labour of the &s;laves, nor having any dependence on the planters, his mind remained &s;o unprejudiced, that the dic|tates of rea&s;on and tender feelings of hu|manity, had free liberty to exert them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bancroft,</HI> whil&s;t he is giving his readers a genuine relation of the prodi|gious oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty exerci&s;ed on the negroes, advances &s;uch arguments in defence of the practice of &s;lavery, as are, indeed, a di&s;honour to rea&s;on, and &s;hock|ing to humanity. He tells us, <Q>That the labour of the country is almo&s;t wholly performed by negroes&mdash;that they are kept at a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and hum|ble di&s;tance, by &s;everity of di&s;cipline,</Q> which he is &s;o hardned as to &s;ay, <Q>not only contributes to the &s;afety of the white inhabitants, but even the happi|ne&s;s of the &s;laves, becau&s;e, adds he, the impo&s;&s;ibility of attaining is ever found to de&s;troy the de&s;ire of enjoyment, and rigid treatment, by annihilating every hope of liberty, renders the &s;laves con|tent with the enjoyment of &s;lavery.</Q>&mdash;He
<PB N="60" REF="013762_0059_0F91A744C9883F20">acknowledges, <Q>That the negroes are indeed &s;purred to indu&s;try by the whip of correction, which is ever at their heels, and not &s;paringly exerci&s;ed; but, that there is no medium: either the minds of the &s;laves mu&s;t be de|pre&s;&s;ed by abject &s;lavery, or the lives of the ma&s;ters are in imminent danger: For this rea&s;on (he &s;ays) they have been oppre&s;&s;ed by many humiliating penalties and di&s;tinctions. The evi|dence of &s;laves relating to white per&s;ons are of no validity. An attempt to &s;trike a white inhabitant is puni&s;hed with death. Their ma&s;ters or over&s;eers have not only the power of inflicting cor|poral puni&s;hment, but are in &s;ome mea&s;ure allowed to exerci&s;e a right over their lives, &s;ince the putting a negro to death is attended only with a pecu|niary puni&s;hment. In which &s;ituation, he confe&s;&s;es, they are &s;ubject to many complicated &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, expo&s;ed to the tyranny of the imperious, and lu&s;t of the libidinous; and to an in|ce&s;&s;ant toil which will have no period but with their lives.</Q> Thus this au|thor thro' the whole of his rea&s;oning, ma|nife&s;tly &s;hews the depraving effect which the &s;ight and practice of tho&s;e bard and cruel mea&s;ures which are attendant on
<PB N="61" REF="013762_0060_0F91A7452FAC73D8">&s;lavery, has upon the heart and rea&s;on of men, otherwi&s;e of good judgment.&mdash;Hence he adds, <Q>That tho' this treat|ment has the appearance of cruelty, and cannot be reconciled to the principles of ju&s;tice and equity, yet many things which are repugnant to humanity, may be excu&s;ed on account of their nece&s;&s;ity and for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation.</Q>&mdash;Speaking of the provi&s;ion made for the negroes in food and cloathing, he &s;ays, <Q>The ex|pence of maintaining them in this climate is very trifling&mdash;they are a&s;&s;igned a piece of ground, from this the &s;lave is &s;upplied with a &s;ufficient &s;tock for his &s;u&s;tenance; on which however he is not allowed to labour but only on &s;undays; receiving from his ma&s;ter a weekly allowance of dried fi&s;h to the amount of a pound and an half; which is all that his ma&s;ter con|tributes towards his food. The females receive the &s;ame treatment, and the drink of both is nothing but water: yet from this water and vegetables, with a mor&s;el of dried fi&s;h, the&s;e people derive &s;ufficient nutriment to &s;u&s;tain the harde&s;t labour in the mo&s;t enervat|ing climate. The cloathing of the ne|groes (who work in the fields) is &s;carce &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of
<PB N="62" REF="013762_0061_0F91A745F3132648">mode&s;ty. If any of them have either &s;hirts, breeches, or petticoats, they are the produce of their private indu&s;try, as their ma&s;ters furni&s;h only a piece of coar&s;e blue or brown linen, which is applied to the middle, in both &s;exes, and a blanket with which the &s;lave covers him&s;elf at night; &s;leeping on boards only.</Q></P>
<P>The account given by the <HI>French</HI> officer of the di&s;po&s;ition of the blacks, and the treatment they received from his coun|trymen on the i&s;land <HI>Mauritius,</HI> is as affect|ing as the former, tho' apparently wrote from a different motive and in a quite different &s;pirit. He informs us, that the &s;laves who are employed in the cultivation of that i&s;land, are brought chiefly from the i&s;land <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> &s;ituate about two hundred leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P>"That the&s;e black men, who&s;e features bear a nearer &s;imilitude to the <HI>Europeans</HI> than the negroes of <HI>Guinea,</HI> are handy, intelligent, and &s;en&s;ible of honour: In their own country they apply them&s;elves to many little handicrafts with great in|du&s;try; they are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of dancing and mu&s;ic; their in&s;trument is a kind of bow, to which a caliba&s;h is fixed; from which they draw a &s;oft kind of har|mony, accompanied with &s;ongs of their
<PB N="63" REF="013762_0062_0F91A746B229F310">own compo&s;ition. Love is always the &s;ubject. The girls dance to the &s;ong of their lovers; the &s;pectators beat time.&mdash;The&s;e poor people in their own country are extremely ho&s;pitable: when a black in <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> is on his journey, he goes into the fir&s;t hou&s;e that &s;uits his exigency, and tho' unknown, the family &s;hare their provi&s;ions with him. He is neither a&s;ked whence he comes nor whither he goes: it is the cu&s;tom of the country. With &s;uch arts and &s;uch manners the&s;e black people are brought to the i&s;land <HI>Mauritius</HI> to la|bour for the whites. They are &s;et on &s;hore quite naked, except a rag that covers their loins; the men are ranged on one &s;ide and the women on the other, with their little children, who cling about the mother thro' fear. The planter examines the whole, and purcha&s;es &s;uch as &s;uits him. Brothers, &s;i&s;ters, friends, lovers, are &s;epa|rated; they take leave of each other with tears, and depart for the plantation. The&s;e blacks are naturally of a joyous temper; but after &s;ome years of &s;lavery they grow melancholy.&mdash;The treatment they receive from their ma&s;ters is rigor|ous: at day break, three cracks of the whip are the &s;ignal that calls them to work: each &s;lave appears in the plantation with their mattock; here they work al|mo&s;t

<P>And here it may not be improper to lay before the reader a few in&s;tances from the many, very many, which might be given of the &s;hocking cruelties exer|ci&s;ed on the mi&s;erable negroes, being a &s;triking in&s;tance of the dreadful in&s;en&s;i|bility which the habit of hard and cruel mea&s;ures will gradually introduce in the human heart.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance was related by a per|&s;on who furni&s;hed the compiler with the adverti&s;ement from <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> viz. That whil&s;t he was there a negro wo|man flying into the woods, probably from ill u&s;age, was pur&s;ued by the over|&s;eer, who having met with her, after cruelly beating her, fa&s;tned her to his hor&s;e, &s;o to drag rather than lead her; that before he reached the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he was a dead corp&s;e. Such u&s;age of a fellow-creature appeared mo&s;t unnatural and cruel to the relater; but what mo&s;t &s;ur|prized him was, to find that this poor creature's life being taken away in &s;o brutal a manner, made no impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the people; it rai&s;ed no
<PB N="72" REF="013762_0071_0F91A751AE1082D0">indignation again&s;t the murderer, or commi&s;eration for the unhappy victim; they &s;eemed quite hardned to &s;uch &s;cenes. He heard but one per&s;on take any man|ner of notice of the matter.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance fell under the imme|diate notice of a per&s;on of credit, when in the i&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> now re&s;iding in this city. Hearing a grievous cry, he went to the place from whence it came, where he &s;aw a young negro wo|man of about eighteen years of age, &s;wung by her hands, with heavy weights at her feet, and a man la&s;hing her naked body with a hard whip; making pau&s;es from time to time, and flinging pickle or &s;alt and water on the wounds, the whip had made. The &s;ight was &s;o hor|rible, that he turned from it and came home. Sometime after, looking out, he &s;aw this &s;ame young woman carried dead on a board: She had been cruelly whip|ped to death; neither did he ob&s;erve that this pitious &s;pectacle drew the concern or hardly attention of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>A third in&s;tance happened in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of a per&s;on now re&s;iding there. A ve&s;&s;el had taken in a number of &s;laves, on the coa&s;t of Guinea, among&s;t the&s;e was a man, who probably

They attempted to tie him with ropes, but that not an&s;wering their purpo&s;e, they confined him in irons, and other|wi&s;e &s;o tormented him during their pa&s;|&s;age from <HI>Guinea,</HI> in order to bring down his &s;pirit, that when they arrived at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> he was in &s;o weak a con|dition as to be &s;carce able to walk to the place of &s;ale, but as he was urged on with the whip.

This rai&s;ed the anger of the captain to &s;o great a degree, that he &s;truck the poor fellow &s;o hard a blow, with &s;omething like an hand&s;pike, as broke both his arms, whereby the captain looking upon the fellow as di&s;abled and unfit for &s;ale, gave him another blow on the head, which cau&s;ed his brains to fly about the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

Be &s;o gra|cious then, ye petty tyrants over hu|man freedom, to let your &s;laves judge for them&s;elves, what it is which makes their own happine&s;s. And then &s;ee whe|ther they do not place it in the return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which
<PB N="82" REF="013762_0081_0F91A75C73AAFD60">their mi&s;ery makes &s;o large a part. A return &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately longed for, that de&s;pairing of happine&s;s here, that is, of e&s;caping the chains of their cruel ta&s;k ma&s;ters, they con&s;ole them&s;elves with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven in their future &s;tate; which I do not find their haughty ma&s;ters have as yet concerned them&s;elves to invade. The le&s;s hardy indeed wait for this felicity till overwearied nature &s;ets them free; but the more re&s;olved have recour&s;e even to &s;elf-violence, to force a &s;peedier pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;till urged, that though what is called human happine&s;s be of &s;o fanta&s;tic a nature, that each man's ima|gination creates it for him&s;elf, yet hu|man mi&s;ery is more &s;ub&s;tantial and uni|form throughout all the tribes of man|kind. Now, from the wor&s;t of human mi&s;eries, the &s;avage <HI>Africans</HI> by the&s;e forced emigrations, are intirely &s;ecured, &s;uch as the being perpetually hunted down like bea&s;ts of prey or pro&s;it, by their more &s;avage and powerful neigh|bours&mdash;In truth, a ble&s;&s;ed change!&mdash;from being hunted to being caught. But who are they that have &s;et on foot this general HUNTING? Are they not
<PB N="83" REF="013762_0082_0F91A75D429E6900">the&s;e very civilized violators of humani|ty them&s;elves? Who tempt the weak appetites, and provoke the wild pa&s;&s;ions of the fiercer &s;avages to pray upon the re&s;t."</P>
