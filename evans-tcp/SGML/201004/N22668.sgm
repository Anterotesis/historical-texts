<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ambitious de&s;ire of &s;eeing your Ma|je&s;ty's name prefixed to this little work may perhaps, in &s;ome degree, be excu&s;ed, on the following con&s;iderations: The fir&s;t is, that this circum&s;tance will immediately excite that preju|dice in its favour, which there could be no hope of its receiving from the name of the tran&s;lator: The other is, that, appearing under the patro|nage of your Maje&s;ty, its power of doing good will be con&s;iderably enlarged.</P>
<P>WHATEVER influence vanity may have on the former of the&s;e motives, the latter cannot, I hope, be blamed. And if the&s;e pages &s;hould
<PB N="iv" REF="029954_0003_0FE381029354A390">
appear calculated to inculcate the principles, or to encourage the practice of VIRTUE, no other argument, I am confident, need be urged to in|duce your Maje&s;ty to &s;uffer them to come forth under the &s;anction of your illu&s;trious au&s;pices.</P>
<P>A LADY of high rank, in&s;tructing her children in virtue and religion, and forming their tender minds to what&s;oever may render them wi&s;e and good, &s;eems, for very obvious rea&s;ons, particu|larly entitled to your Maje&s;ty's gracious atten|tion. But though the re&s;emblance betwixt your Maje&s;ty and the principal character before you, &s;o far as her parental &s;olicitude extends, is too &s;triking to e&s;cape our notice; yet do we thank|fully reflect, that in one re&s;pect a very e&s;&s;ential difference may be ob&s;erved: this lady, MADAM, employed only the uncertain intervals of &s;ickne&s;s, and the anxious moments of an expiring life, in the di&s;charge of that important duty, which is well known to engage your Maje&s;ty's be&s;t hours of youth, and health, and vigour.</P>
<P>MAY your Maje&s;ty happily per&s;evere in &s;o good a work! to the edification of your amiable Offspring in every princely virtue&mdash;to the great

<HEAD>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of <HI>Pope Ganganelli</HI>'s letters, the follow|ing work is honourably mentioned, as being <HI>a com|plete treati&s;e on Education.</HI> From the moment of my &s;eeing it thus &s;poken of, I determined to examine its preten&s;ions to &s;o favourable a character. The pains it has co&s;t me, to render it of general u&s;e to my countrymen, may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t proof of my opinion in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I can truly &s;ay, I have read the book with inex|pre&s;&s;ible delight: the involuntary tear has more than once been witne&s;s to my approbation of that tenderne&s;s of affection, with which it abounds. And the hours, which I have mo&s;t agreeably, and I tru&s;t not un|profitably, pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety of this incomparable mother, have made me ample amends for the trouble
<PB N="vii" REF="029954_0004_0FE3810885D47268">
I have taken, in endeavouring to do ju&s;tice to the dig|nity of her &s;entiments, the warmth of her affection, and the pathetic engergy of her expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I claim no more merit from the follow|ing tran&s;lation, than that which is due to a good inten|tion. It is po&s;&s;ible, that many may profit by the&s;e excellent in&s;tructions, who are unacquainted with the language in which they were written; and &s;ome even of tho&s;e, who are acquainted with it, may yet read them with greater ea&s;e and benefit in their own tongue.</P>
<P>A clo&s;e compari&s;on with the original, I fore&s;ee, may be unfavourable to my reputation as a tran&s;lator; but it cannot injure it as an hone&s;t man. For, with|out adhering with too &s;ervile an attachment to my author, I have endeavoured to expre&s;s the &s;entiments before me as exactly as po&s;&s;ible, except only in a very few pa&s;&s;ages; where, for obvious rea&s;ons, it was nece&s;&s;ary to give a different turn to the expre&s;&s;ions of this excellent woman. In all other in&s;tances, I have cau&s;e to think meanly of my&s;elf, in proportion as I have departed from the original; as nothing can be more pure, more in&s;tructive, or more affecting, than the genuine dictates of that heart, which gave utter|ance to the&s;e mo&s;t intere&s;ting conferences.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="029954_0005_0FE3810D25F58398">If, upon the whole, the following work be read with candour, the tran&s;lator has no doubt of the reader's indulgence: if otherwi&s;e, he has little to hope for, either with re&s;pect to the reader or him&s;elf. He who is de&s;irous to profit by the in&s;tructions here pre&s;ented to him, will be more di&s;po&s;ed to tran&s;cribe them into his own conduct, than to critici&s;e on the preci&s;e terms in which they are conveyed.</P>
<P>There never was a period, in which &s;uch an ad|dre&s;s to the prevailing manners of the age was more nece&s;&s;ary than the pre&s;ent. It will be a matter of un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction to me, if the following pages &s;hould lay the lea&s;t re&s;traint on any of the &s;ons or daughters of plea&s;ure; and if, withdrawing their attention from the pur&s;uit of a phantom, a bubble, and toy, they &s;hould direct it to tho&s;e objects, which religion recommends, which rea&s;on approves, and which virtue and good &s;en&s;e univer&s;ally applayd and admire.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WE here pre&s;ent you with the pure effu&s;ions of parental tenderne&s;s: as filial affection pre|&s;erved them from being lo&s;t, &s;o a de&s;ire to promote the benefit of mankind has induced me to make them public.</P>
<P>THIS excellent woman having her&s;elf given us the hi&s;tory of her life in her fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall only add, that &s;he had every advantage of per&s;on and under&s;tanding; and that nothing can be more affecting, than that di&s;play of female delicacy and manly &s;en&s;e, which appear in the&s;e conferences with her children.</P>
<P>WE here &s;ee a mother, elevated as it were above her&s;elf, and in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of &s;ickne&s;s, and the horrors of the grave; while &s;he is inculcating in the minds of her children the duties which they owe to GOD, to their countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to &s;ociety. Her di&s;|cour&s;e is chiefly directed to tho&s;e two of her &s;ons, who had engaged in a military life; in one of the&s;e conferences, &s;he addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf particularly to her third &s;on, who had dedicated him&s;elf to the church: another is confined to the in&s;truction of her daughter. In all of them, her admonitions are enforced with tears, and interrupted by &s;ighs; they are the natural dictates of the tendere&s;t affection, which no bodily
<PB N="x" REF="029954_0006_0FE38114D2C0B478">
infirmities could prevail with her to &s;uppre&s;s. If the reader finds not in this work tho&s;e epi&s;odes, or that variety which di&s;tingui&s;hes a romance, it is only be|cau&s;e Truth wants none of the&s;e embelli&s;hments: &s;he needs only to be &s;een, to command our attention and our admiration: the voice of nature is heard throughout the work, and the eloquence here di&s;|played is the forcible language of the heart.</P>
<P>THE evening being made choice of as the propere&s;t &s;ea&s;on for in&s;truction, we find the work divided into EVENING CONFERENCES. The whole was faith|fully collected by the indu&s;try of an AMANUENSIS, &s;o placed as to be an ear-witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed. Had not this care been taken, the world would have been deprived of an invaluable &s;y&s;tem of education, which no one can read with inattention, and few without improvement.</P>
<P>THE reader will at once perceive, that though the expre&s;&s;ions of our admirable in&s;tructre&s;s are dive&s;ted of ornament and art, &s;he was a per&s;on of &s;uperior abilities, and great knowledge.</P>
<P>IT were a tribute ju&s;tly due to the memory of &s;uch a lady, to tran&s;mit her name, with all the re&s;pect which is due to it, to po&s;terity. But as her humility induced her to wi&s;h &s;he might not be recorded after her death, we think our&s;elves obliged to do violence to our inclinations, in compliance with her la&s;t reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="029954_0006_0FE38114D2C0B478">NOR are we at all apprehen&s;ive, that this conceal|ment will impeach the authenticity of the work: it is conceived in &s;uch terms, as to convince any judicious reader, that &s;uch &s;entiments could only be founded in nature. Here are no brilliant conceits, no affected phra&s;es; but the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of maternal affection: he who does not yield to the force of &s;uch evidence as this, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as one who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h what is really the lan|guage of nature; or as one who never yet experi|enced the power of &s;entimental affection.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY does not always go hand in hand with truth; but they are happily united in this work. What indeed can be conceived more natural, than that a tender mother, anxious for her children's welfare, &s;hould take advantage of her gradually de|clining health to &s;et before them the vanities of the world; and to give them the be&s;t directions for the regulation of their conduct? Let any man enter &s;eriou&s;ly into him&s;elf; li&s;ten to the language of his own heart&mdash;he will &s;oon find, that tho&s;e noble &s;enti|ments, which occur in the following pages, could never have been the offspring of imagination. The life of this incomparable mother was but too &s;hort, as it did not exceed thirty-nine years; but &s;he will yet live in the&s;e her genuine conferences, which no doubt will be watered with the reader's tears.</P>

<HEAD>ADVICE FROM A LADY OF QUALITY TO HER CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="conference">
<HEAD><HI>CONFERENCE I.</HI> The Hi&s;tory of her own Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE very weak &s;tate of health, in which I have now been eighteen months, forbids me to hope for any long continuation of my life I have determined therefore, my dear children, to call yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together, as well to di&s;charge my obligations, as to amu&s;e my &s;ufferings. By the lo&s;s of your father, my duties as a mother &s;eem to be re|doubled; I am called upon to &s;upply to you the want of his excellent advice, and to labour to render you worthy in|heritors of his glory and his virtues.</P>
<P>YOU are not in&s;en&s;ible of the obligations laid upon you, to &s;hew mankind from what ance&s;tors you derive your origin. Their hi&s;tory you are &s;ufficiently acquainted with, to know WHO they were, and HO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves: but perhaps their example may le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly affect your minds, than my advice: e&s;pecially if you con&s;ider, that it is your
<PB N="2" REF="029954_0008_0FE3811FC1ADC770">
be&s;t friend, who is now conver&s;ing with you; one, who&s;e in|&s;tructions are the dictates of affection, and the re&s;ult of a tender regard for your happine&s;s. The only books, from which my precepts &s;hall be drawn, are experience, a knowl|edge of the world, and the convictions of my own heart.</P>
<P>DESCENDED from a family not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by its misfortunes than its honours, I was left an orphan at ten years of age. My education fell under the direction of my father's &s;i&s;ter; who&s;e inclination, as well as rank, drew her frequently to court. No time was lo&s;t in furni&s;hing me with ma&s;ters of every kind. I &s;oon became an object of attention; and my friends took care to announce me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con|&s;iderable fortune. The world pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view in the mo&s;t brilliant colours; and with &s;ingular delight I in|de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged the deception. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of amu&s;ements &s;erved to &s;tifle reflection; and I &s;eemed to live for no other purpo&s;e than to pur&s;ue my plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES my &s;oul, not quite as yet deba&s;ed, &s;eemed de&s;irous to &s;oar above the&s;e enchanting trifles; but vanity and di&s;&s;ipation &s;oon hurried me away, and effaced the impre&s;|&s;ions of reflection. How far from real happine&s;s is a life of &s;ubjection to prevailing fa&s;hions; from which it has neither opportunity, nor re&s;olution to withdraw it&s;elf! In vain do we perceive the mi&s;eries, which intrude them&s;elves amid&s;t the plea&s;ures of the world; in vain do we receive in&s;tructions, by which we might be both affected and improved: we &s;till continue en&s;laved to our pa&s;&s;ions, and eagerly embrace the phantom of delu&s;ion. I re&s;embled tho&s;e travellers, who, knowing the right way, yet thinking to &s;horten their journey, turn a&s;ide from it, and are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL that were about me, con&s;pired to fill my mind with fal&s;e ideas; their language was that of flattery and deceit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="3" REF="029954_0008_0FE3811FC1ADC770">
they either concealed from me my faults, or they only cor|rected &s;uch as might &s;erve to render me ridiculous. Scarce had I begun the day, when my attendants made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;pire me with a love of idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure: one part of it was &s;pent in decorating my per&s;on with all the ornaments of dre&s;s; and the other, in receiving the rewards of my unprofitable indu&s;try. I was admired, in proportion to my external appearance; and this admiration &s;erved only to feed my vanity.</P>
<P>I NEVER &s;hall forget, that, being one evening quite over|come with that &s;atiety, which de&s;troys the &s;atisfaction of the votaries of plea&s;ure, I opened by chance a volume of moral e&s;&s;ays, a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of which &s;illed my &s;oul with confu&s;ion and remor&s;e: "<HI>Either,</HI> &s;aid I to my&s;elf. <HI>I am a dupe to the life which I now lead, or this writer is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gious impo&s;tor.</HI>"</P>
<P>THESE reflections began to di&s;quiet me; when I was in|formed, that it was time for me to go to a ball, to which I had been invited: my guardian, who took me with her in her coach, ob&s;erved that I was unu&s;ually pen&s;ive; for which &s;he &s;eriou&s;ly reproved me. Though &s;he was in many re&s;pects an excellent woman, &s;he was almo&s;t wholly engaged in the pur&s;uit of amu&s;ements: &s;he repeated her cen&s;ures, when we entered the ball-room, in which every thing appear|ed truly magnificent; the elegant ta&s;te of the D&mdash;&s;s of&mdash; had brought together per&s;ons of the mo&s;t eminent rank, beauty, and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>TOO &s;oon the in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, and harmony of the voices, made me forget my Monitor, and all his rea&s;oning: my heart, again &s;educed by plea&s;ure, quickly per&s;uaded me that &s;uch au&s;tere morality was calculated only to fill us with melancholy: I danced with &s;ome degree of elegance, and the prai&s;es be&s;towed upon me were exce&s;&s;ive; in &s;hort, I returned home more enchanted than ever, with the world.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029954_0009_0FE3812465C26990">WE cro&s;&s;ed the park, which a judicious di&s;tribution of lamps had &s;o illuminated, as to give it almo&s;t the glare of noon-day. The crowd of people about us, the variety of faces and dre&s;&s;es, an unre&s;trained fe&s;tivity, which every where prevailed, all &s;erved to &s;educe my &s;oul with &s;tronger delu&s;ions. One needs no more than &s;uch a &s;cene as this, to ruin one's ta&s;te forever. It fills the mind with the va&s;t idea of the world and its plea|&s;ures; and when once the heart has received the&s;e fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to efface them.</P>
<P>SIX years pa&s;&s;ed away in a continual round of plea&s;ure and diver&s;ions; at the end of which, I was married to your much honoured father. Some circum&s;tances, fortunate for me, gave HIM the preference in my regard to &s;everal young noble|men, who had profe&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to me. Had any one of THESE &s;ucceeded in his addre&s;&s;es, I &s;hould have been wedded to folly and repentance; it was my hap|pier lot to be connected with di&s;cretion and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t needs appear with eclat on our marriage, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this re&s;pect my natural turn of mind was of great &s;ervice to me; it made me as &s;plendid, as I was vain: And as our in|come was &s;uch as enabled me to indulge my ta&s;te for &s;hew, I gave the reins to it without re&s;traint. I kept a &s;ort of court, in which I pre&s;ided as a &s;overeign prince&s;s: My cour|tiers were lavi&s;h of their prai&s;es, they were &s;uppliant for favours, and my hu&s;band and I were con&s;idered as beings &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind in happine&s;s and honours.</P>
<P>A WAR with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria deprived me of your father, for a time: He parted from me with that heroic &s;pirit, which di&s;tingui&s;hed his character to the late&s;t moment of his life; while in his ab&s;ence I gave my&s;elf up to &s;orrow and regret. His letters, however, comforted me; and no &s;onner was my peace of mind re&s;tored, than my ta&s;te for
<PB N="5" REF="029954_0009_0FE3812465C26990">
plea&s;ure returned. The opera of THETIS was performed, at which I was pre&s;ent; and then it was, that my fondne&s;s for publick diver&s;ions re&s;umed its dominion in my heart. I now put my&s;elf forward to &s;it in judgment on every new theatrical performance; and was the fir&s;t to admire the deco|rations of the &s;tage. The world is like a troubled &s;ea, who&s;e waves always carry us away much farther than we at fir&s;t intended to go.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding my allowed ta&s;te for whatever might gratify the &s;en&s;es, or encourage vanity; I was generally con&s;idered as a pattern of prudence and di&s;cretion: People were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a young woman, only twenty years old, with any other pa&s;&s;ion than a love for dre&s;s, and &s;hew, and diver&s;ions. The world cannot conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that while we are gliding down the &s;tream of luxury and plea&s;ure, we are, in the eye of rea&s;on, objects of pity.</P>
<P>THE hints, which I had received from my friendly Moni|tor, who&s;e writings I had only cur&s;orily dipt into, were per|petually obtruding them&s;elves; but, like tho&s;e gentle breezes, which ruffle the &s;urface of the waters, they only &s;erved to glance upon my heart. What &s;urprized me was, that a very di&s;creet relation of mine, to whom I had mentioned this author, &s;trictly forbade me looking into it. But this &s;he did, as &s;he many years afterwards declared, merely to excite my eagerne&s;s to read it, and attach me more &s;trongly to my book. She well knew, that prohibition &s;erves only to &s;timulate; and that to interdict, is often the &s;ure&s;t means of fixing our affections on that which is forbidden us. Her &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded; I was never at re&s;t, 'till I became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, and 'till I had read them again and again. His reflections gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; but I was &s;o far from being amended by them, that I only compared this emotion
<PB N="6" REF="029954_0010_0FE3812BE57E5BB0">
to the tran&s;ient effect of a tragical repre&s;entation on the &s;tage. I was affected for a moment, and that was all.</P>
<P>AT length, your father returned from the war, covered with wounds and laurels: The compliments which were paid to him at court, and the honours which were heaped upon him, occa&s;ioned a &s;econd diver&s;ion of my thoughts, which plunged me deeper than ever in the gulf of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>MY fir&s;t &s;tudy was, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the elegance of my entertainments; and in this I was very &s;ucce&s;sful; my exqui&s;ite ta&s;te was generally admired, and every one expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. What an encouragement was this to a woman, who&s;e only ambition was to &s;hine in her &s;phere, to plea&s;e and be applauded! You will not wonder, that our expences were exce&s;&s;ive; and that, to &s;upport our vanity, we dimini&s;hed our &s;ub&s;tance, and con&s;equently your inheritance.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, my dear children, that I lay open to you, with|out re&s;erve, all the circum&s;tances of my life; and that my language is that of one, who&s;e heart dictates nothing but tenderne&s;s and &s;incerity. Where my conduct has been faulty, you will, I am &s;ure, be the fir&s;t to forgive: It may, perhaps, prove a fortunate circum&s;tance for YOU, that I, who have been fir&s;t &s;educed into the ways of vanity and folly, am the better enabled to point out to you that path, which it will be your wi&s;dom and happine&s;s to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>CERTAIN it is, that this abridgment of our fortune wrought &s;ome change in my manner of life: Your father again left me in obedience to the orders of the court, which &s;ent him into ITALY; and I endeavoured to amu&s;e my&s;elf in his ab&s;ence by reading our be&s;t hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>THERE with delight I found the name, which you bear, mentioned with honour in the French and Engli&s;h hi&s;tory;
<PB N="7" REF="029954_0010_0FE3812BE57E5BB0">
there &s;aw I tho&s;e virtues di&s;played by your ance&s;tors, which I hope it will be the &s;tudy of your lives to imitate.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time, my friend&s;hip commenced with the Counte&s;s of S&mdash;, an excellent lady, of whom the hand of death has lately deprived the world; in which &s;he &s;eemed to live for no other purpo&s;e, than to do good. Her conver&s;ation charmed me; her prudence delighted me; there was no opportunity of in&s;truction, which &s;he did not improve; and this &s;he did with &s;o much ea&s;e and affability, and in a man|ner &s;o natural and agreeable, that the mo&s;t incon&s;iderate could not but attend to her: She often urged to me the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting in the &s;ame character the Philo&s;opher and the Chri&s;tian. Here I mu&s;t acknowledge, not without taking &s;hame to my&s;elf, that the plea&s;ures of the world left me nothing more than a fruitle&s;s de&s;ire of being what I ought to be. It was continually interpo&s;ing it&s;elf between the conviction of my judgment, and the propen&s;ities of my will, 'till my mind was utterly di&s;tracted: I would, and I would not; and my exi&s;tence was nothing more than a life perpetu|ally interrupted with doubt and perplexity.</P>
<P>IN this &s;trange &s;ituation did your father find me at his return. The King received him with that gracious air, which often &s;erves in&s;tead of more &s;ub&s;tantial favours; and which is in fact equivalent to a recompence. Every one partook of my joy; and dragged me out, as it were, in &s;pite of my&s;elf, into the mid&s;t of plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions. Paris and Ver&s;ailles, each in its turn, beheld me wholly engaged in doing honour to my hu&s;band on account of his good fortune. Plea&s;ure and ambition are cruel tyrants; they leave us not a moment to our&s;elves; and when they have filled us with hope, they almo&s;t always abandon us to di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029954_0011_0FE381308B4AEE20">YOUR father, though much engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, had his intervals of &s;olitude and retirement: He &s;ometimes pleaded indi&s;po&s;ition, that he might apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of his profe&s;&s;ion; and, as I imagined, to amu&s;e him&s;elf by a change of employment. He found, that the world has every thing that is good in it, except true wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>THE re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of mankind renewed the war; and again obliged me to live in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from a hu&s;|band, who was dearer to me than my&s;elf. His valour, which rendered him in&s;en&s;ible of danger, procured him at the &s;ame time the honour&mdash;of being grievou&s;ly wounded, and of being made a Lieutenant-General. Joy and &s;olicitude by turns took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart; and in this anxious &s;tate I con|tinued, 'till I was fully a&s;&s;ured of his perfect recovery.</P>
<P>THIS advancement of my hu&s;band revived my pa&s;&s;ion for the vanities of the world: I now again felt my&s;elf inclined to ta&s;te largely of the plea&s;ures of the court. I hired one hou&s;e at Ver&s;ailles, and another at Fontainbieau; and my ta&s;te for luxury, together with my natural vanity, led me to fit them up in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive manner. I piqued my&s;elf on having more elegant furniture than any woman of my rank, and on having my table more &s;umptuou&s;ly &s;upplied. I became pro|verbial for the magnificence of my entertainments; and happy was the man, who could be pre&s;ent at them. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion a&s;&s;embled at my hou&s;e with eagerne&s;s; and each endeavoured to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by the utmo&s;t exertion of plea&s;antry and humour.</P>
<P>I NEVER found my&s;elf &s;o far removed from wi&s;dom, as when I was &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t celebrated wits: I heard nothing from them but &s;allies of mirth, which interrupted all &s;erious thoughts; and &s;uch flighty conver&s;ation, as &s;erv|ed only to &s;tifle reflection. Our deci&s;ions were peremptory
<PB N="9" REF="029954_0011_0FE381308B4AEE20">
on every &s;ubject, and were wholly influenced by fa&s;hion and by prejudice.</P>
<P>THUS was my mind entirely taken up in the pur&s;uit of folly; in&s;tead of being employed, as it ought to have been, in attending to your education.</P>
<P>THE prevalence of cu&s;tom, my dear children, had taught me to think, that I ought not to have you with me more than a few days in a year; with which cu&s;tom I could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> com|ply, without doing violence to my tenderne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion for you. In&s;tead of endeavouring to inform my&s;elf, what &s;chool was under the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t regulation, my inquiry was, which was the mo&s;t genteel; and I was much more de&s;irous that you &s;hould form honourable connexions, than that you &s;hould receive good in&s;tructions: Thus did I &s;ecretly en|courage your vanity, while your IMPROVEMENT ought to have been my principal care. When we cannot amend our faults, the lea&s;t we can do is to acknowledge them: And do not think that I offer any violence to my&s;elf in thus con|fe&s;&s;ing my folly, and indi&s;cretion: It is my greate&s;t comfort, that I am giving you this &s;ure&s;t evidence of my repentance. If my affection for you were le&s;s than it is, I &s;hould &s;peak to you with le&s;s &s;incerity; it is the compunction I feel, for having li&s;tened more attentively to the voice of cu&s;tom than to that of my duty, which extorts from me this undi&s;gui&s;|ed profe&s;&s;ion of my mi&s;conduct; in &s;hort, my extreme &s;oli|citude for you, bani&s;hes every &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration from my mind.</P>
<P>THE conduct of your father di&s;tingui&s;hed him now more than ever. He was de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;oldier; in&s;omuch that I dare venture to a&s;&s;ert, without fearing the imputation of partiality or o&s;tentation, that the dignity of Field-Mar&s;hal, to which he was advanced, was
<PB N="10" REF="029954_0012_0FE381386A5A4130">
no more than a di&s;tinction due to his &s;uperior merit as an officer. He &s;aw him&s;elf elevated to the highe&s;t point of honour in his profe&s;&s;ion; at a time of life, wherein he was very capable of enjoying the fruits of his promotion; being at that time not fifty years old.</P>
<P>I WAS too fond of gaiety and plea&s;ure, not to &s;urpa&s;s on this occa&s;ion all my former in&s;tances of luxury and expen&s;e. Balls, illuminations and entertainments of every kind, con&s;pired to celebrate that happy event, which filled my heart with joy; and nothing was now to be &s;een around me, but trophie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> erected to my vanity: I was wholly taken up in going from one circle to another, eager to receive congratulation and ap|plau&s;e from every quarter. But how incon&s;tant is all earth|ly glory! alas! your father died within three years after his promotion to the honour of a Mar&s;hal: And my heart, overpowered by this dreadful &s;troke, &s;eemed to go down with him even into the grave. He died like a Chri&s;tian philo&s;opher; full of loyalty to his King, full of tenderne&s;s for his wife and children; and mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;iring to be admitted into the pre&s;ence of GOD. He would have been better plea&s;ed, had his la&s;t breath been drawn in the &s;ervice of his country; and had he been permitted to make com|pen&s;ation with his life, for the honours which his &s;overeign had heaped upon him.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t year of my widowhood was wholly given up to the effu&s;ions of grief; to an utter di&s;reli&s;h for every kind of &s;atisfaction, and to an entire indifference about my&s;elf and every thing around me. I thought of nothing, but a mo&s;t affectionate hu&s;band, who was now no more; and this &s;ad idea &s;erved only to fill my &s;oul with the mo&s;t melancholy reflections.</P>
<P>I COULD then have readily an&s;wered for my&s;elf, that the
<PB N="11" REF="029954_0012_0FE381386A5A4130">
world would never more take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart. But the world is not content with being a ma&s;ter only: It is a TYRANT, which holds its va&s;&s;als in fetters of iron; from which in vain I endeavoured to relea&s;e my&s;elf: My former habits re&s;umed their empire in my heart; and though I did not forget my hu&s;band, I forgot all my re&s;olutions. I now appeared a fa&s;hionable widow; wholly taken up by the plea&s;ures of the world, and all its vanities. My greate&s;t comfort in this moment of reflection is, that I never could be prevailed with to li&s;ten to any propo&s;als of a &s;econd mar|riage. I had too much re&s;pect for the memory of your father, ever to con&s;ent to lo&s;e his name; and I had too much regard for you his children, ever to endanger your welfare and happine&s;s by &s;uch a &s;tep. This double attach|ment was &s;uperior to every other con&s;ideration; I felt my&s;elf altogether devoted to my children; who I feared might be le&s;s the objects of my attention, if I transferred my affections to any other: This &s;ingle circum&s;tance was &s;ufficient to determine me. Heaven grant, that you may make me the be&s;t return for this &s;acrifice, not merely by your thanks, but by the tendere&s;t regard for my happine&s;s. I have not a more &s;incere wi&s;h, than to excite your affection; and as I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the full extent of my own, no one &s;urely can blame me for earne&s;tly de&s;iring, that our love for each other &s;hould be reciprocal.</P>
<P>WERE I &s;o unhappy as to di&s;cover in either of you an abatement of affection towards me, I &s;hould remind you, that there is not one of you, who&s;e birth was not almo&s;t the occa&s;ion of my death; and that the more I &s;uffered in bringing you into the world, the more clo&s;ely is my heart attached to you: This only knows to what degree you have hitherto engaged its affections; and I can truly &s;ay, that,
<PB N="12" REF="029954_0013_0FE3813D1A16F098">
amid&s;t the di&s;&s;ipations of a life of plea&s;ure, I never felt any REAL &s;atisfaction but in &s;eeing you thus &s;itting round me. Happy moment! the only one which can afford me a gleam of con&s;olation for a lo&s;s, which I can never cea&s;e to lament.</P>
<P>BUT, to return to the world; which continually en&s;laved my affections, and which, whil&s;t I was engaged in the grat|ification of my pa&s;&s;ion for plea&s;ure, &s;uffered me not to re&s;t, day or night. I had &s;acrificed to it the be&s;t moments of my life; the hours de&s;tined to calm repo&s;e were devoted to it; and, on the return of every day, fre&s;h &s;nares were laid for me; and new temptations offered to engage me in its &s;ervice. I found my&s;elf ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to its caprice; I was pre&s;ent at every publick a&s;&s;embly; I had a high opin|ion of its extravagancies; I &s;tudied all its refinements; I commended only what the world approved; I rejected only what the world condemned: I was, in &s;hort, as much a &s;lave to its commands, as one who has no power to move or act, without the permi&s;&s;ion of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, quite wearied with its importunity, I wi&s;hed to &s;hake off the yoke; and to enter into a &s;erious examination or my heart; of which it had too long maintained an entire di&s;po&s;al: But &s;uch tran&s;ient inclina|tions only &s;erved to convince me of my weakne&s;s. This &s;ufficiently appeared, when after &s;ome days of &s;trict retire|ment, which &s;hould have been the commencement of a new life, a &s;light invitation called me forth again, to put my&s;elf under the power of my tyrant; and made me fool|i&s;hly repent of having ever wi&s;hed to withdraw my&s;elf from his dominion.</P>
<P>IN the mean time I began to perceive that the &s;pring of my life was pa&s;&s;ed and gone; and that it was time to break
<PB N="13" REF="029954_0013_0FE3813D1A16F098">
the charm, which thus &s;educed me: However the lot was ca&s;t, and rather than have recour&s;e to rea&s;on, I employed every artifice to &s;upply the deficiency of blooming youth. Thus did I at once endeavour to impo&s;e on others, and delude my&s;elf; and nothing but the a&s;toni&s;hing incident which I am going to relate, was capable of overcoming this dangerous illu&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAVING been informed that a new play was to be acted, I engaged to go with a party of friends to the theatre, and among the re&s;t, with Lady &mdash;, whom I loved with the tendere&s;t affection. At the appointed hour, I called at the door of my friend. Surpri&s;ed, at my arrival, not to find any of the &s;ervants ready to receive me, I immediately ran up into her bed-chamber; I went to her, and &s;aluting her, I a&s;ked her the rea&s;on why &s;he was not ready to go with me: Oh! Heaven! She was dead! Her countenance &s;till retained its beauty; her fle&s;h was yet warm, but her body was motionle&s;s and lifele&s;s! Having &s;hricked &s;o loud as to fill the whole hou&s;e with my cries, I fell into a &s;woon, which la&s;ted above an hour and a half. The dome&s;ticks, who in their con&s;ternation had fled different ways, re-a&s;&s;embled at the noi&s;e of my cries; and u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible endeavour to bring me to my &s;en&s;es. After which, they informed me, that their mi&s;tre&s;s was ju&s;t dead of a quin&s;y, that had choked her. Conceive, if you can, the horrors of my &s;ituation; I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated with grief, which laboured to expre&s;s it&s;elf; and in the utmo&s;t terror and amazement, I withdrew from this &s;cene.</P>
<P>BY this method it &s;eemed that heaven thought fit to act upon my mind, to di&s;&s;ipate impo&s;ture and delu&s;ion. I re|turned to my hou&s;e, wherein I &s;aw nothing but emblems of pride and vanity. I now di&s;covered for the fir&s;t time, that
<PB N="14" REF="029954_0014_0FE38145A536DEE8">
tho&s;e &s;pecious charms, with which the world had &s;o long deceived me, were in reality no better than &s;plendid mi&s;eries. I now reflected, that I had been only a dupe to my own pride, and the fa&s;hions of the world: That I had been running after a phantom of happine&s;s, which had e&s;caped me; that human life was mo&s;t uncertain in its tenure; in &s;hort, that my e&s;&s;aye&s;t, who had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, had told me the truth; and that one mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely blind, not to &s;ee the force of his arguments.</P>
<P>AS I had learnt from experience to di&s;tru&s;t my own weak|ne&s;s, I felt no inclination to make a publick profe&s;&s;ion of my change of &s;entiments; e&s;pecially, as I knew that it is not ea&s;y to &s;upport a con&s;i&s;tency of character in extremes; that too great zeal is &s;eldom la&s;ting, and almo&s;t always indi&s;creet; and that to di&s;charge the duties of Chri&s;tianity, it was &s;ufficient to be&mdash;a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I in&s;en&s;ibly withdrew my&s;elf from the world and its plea&s;ures; and under a pretence of taking care of my health, as my con&s;titution had been always delicate, I began with living very much alone, and no more mixing in large companies. I was con&s;idered as an invalid; and after a few cen&s;ures from my acquaintance, the world as ea&s;ily re&s;igned me, as it had formerly &s;olicited me. There is nothing &s;ooner forgotten, than a per&s;on, who wi&s;hes to be &s;o: one's retirement from the world may afford a topic of conver&s;ation for a day, and to-morrow nothing more is &s;aid about us.</P>
<P>MY &s;olitude being neither the affectation of &s;ingularity, nor the effect of ill humour, but the re&s;ult of &s;erious reflection; I continued to di&s;charge the duties which I owed to &s;ociety: I made my appearance at court, when it was thought nece&s;&s;ary; I vi&s;ited my acquaintance when
<PB N="15" REF="029954_0014_0FE38145A536DEE8">
civility required it: I paid that attention to the duties of my &s;tation, which it appeared to demand; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it down as a maxim, only to ab&s;tain from &s;uch things, as religion and rea&s;on forbade.</P>
<P>VERY &s;oon the plea&s;ure of reading &s;erious books, and of &s;tudying my&s;elf, convinced me, that true happine&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts in conformity to truth; and that they, who give them|&s;elves up to a life of di&s;&s;ipation, have in reality nothing more than the &s;hadow of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT horrible &s;pectacle before mentioned, continually pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind. I never can forget, that, whil&s;t I fancied I was embracing a living friend, I held in my arms only a lifele&s;s corp&s;e, on which GOD him&s;elf had already pa&s;&s;ed an irrevocable &s;entence! At midnight the image of my friend very frequently appeared to my di&s;turbed imagination; whom I had been wi&s;hing to drag to the theatre, while heaven was pronouncing an irrever&s;ible decree either of life or death everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>THIS it was, my children, which opened my eyes to a &s;ight of my duty; this it was, which determined me to cultivate and improve your good di&s;po&s;itions, and to &s;ow in your hearts the &s;eeds of virtue and religion.</P>
<P>MAY heaven ble&s;s and pro&s;per my de&s;ign! Indeed it is with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction I ob&s;erve, that your &s;entiments appear to be &s;uch, as &s;eem likely to do honour to the memory of your father; and that you want nothing but a little more knowledge and information, and a little more in|clination to attain it. It is with a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;i&s;t you here|in, that I have determined to call you together every evening, when my health will permit; and to di&s;cour&s;e with you on &s;ome of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubjects.

<HEAD>CONFERENCE II. <HI>On</HI> ORDER.</HEAD>
<P>IN vain, my dear children, do my phy&s;icians flatter me on the &s;ubject of my health. I perceive my&s;elf ha&s;tily declining, and am apprehen&s;ive, that if I any longer de|ferred to guard you again&s;t the rocks and &s;hoals which you may meet with in your pa&s;&s;age through the world, whether from the tyranny of cu&s;tom, or from the violence of your own pa&s;&s;ions, I might never be able to di&s;charge that duty, to which my own affection for you, and the dying reque&s;t of your father, &s;o powerfully excite me. His la&s;t words &s;till &s;ounding in my ear, as if they had been uttered by a voice from heaven, dwelt only on this great &s;ubject: The recollec|tion fills my &s;oul with an inexpre&s;&s;ible mixture of tenderne&s;s and grief.</P>
<P>ALAS! our united tears will never be &s;ufficient to deplore our lo&s;s: tho&s;e, which I &s;ee you &s;hed at this time, are the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance that you inherit his generous &s;entiments, and it is the only plea&s;ure which at pre&s;ent I feel my&s;elf ca|pable of enjoying.</P>
<P>YOUR excellent father, ju&s;t before his death, taking me by the hand, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf neatly in the following words:
<PB N="17" REF="029954_0015_0FE3814A4D268038">
<HI>Let your fir&s;t care, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat you, be the education of my children: Be your&s;elf their principal in&s;tructor; and fail not to inculcate with all imaginable earne&s;tne&s;s this great truth, that they are born for no other purpo&s;e, than to con&s;ecrate their lives to the &s;ervice of their</HI> GOD, <HI>and their King; and that they will then only do honour to the memory of their father, when they faithfully di&s;charge this two-fold Duty.</HI> You cannot conceive, my dear children, with what heart-felt di&s;|tre&s;s I recal to mind this la&s;t mo&s;t affecting &s;cene; it pierces my &s;oul with the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;ations of grief. But my &s;olici|tude for your welfare gets the better of every other con&s;idera|tion; and I had rather tear open my wounds afre&s;h, than conceal from you a circum&s;tance, which cannot but affect you in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. I have always kept it trea&s;ured up in my brea&s;t, as a valuable depo&s;it; which I intended &s;ome time or other to produce, whenever you &s;hould be en|abled to judge of its value and importance,</P>
<P>I CALL heaven to witne&s;s, that neither bu&s;ine&s;s nor plea&s;ure has ever been able to efface the remembrance of your father: On the contrary, he is always pre&s;ent to my mind; and in|deed it is this lively repre&s;entation of him, which alone en|ables me to &s;upport his lo&s;s. Without this painful re&s;ource, my mind would have ab&s;olutely &s;unk beneath the burthen of my grief.</P>
<P>BUT now the hour approaches, when I &s;hall be re-united to the tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands; when our a&s;hes, mixed to|gether, &s;hall teach you, my dear children, the in&s;tability of every earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the wi&s;dom of de&s;pi&s;ing the mo|mentary vanities of life, when brought into compari&s;on with the trea&s;ures of an immortal &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT is by &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, that order and regularity are be&s;t pre&s;erved in our minds; and that we are taught the

<P>THIS practice is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s, and &s;o con|formable to the de&s;igns of our Creator, that it cannot be neg|lected without a violation of the laws of GOD. It is this re|gard to duty and propriety, by which peace is pre&s;erved in kingdoms, and union in families: It is this which regulates the conduct of the &s;ervant towards his ma&s;ter, and the &s;ub|ject towards his prince; it is this which engages my love towards you, and your re&s;pect towards me: It is this which makes YOU &s;tudious to mitigate my &s;orrows, and ME ince&s;|&s;antly &s;olicitous to advance your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is this regularity of conduct, which makes us good pa|rents, good friends, and good citizens; which gives us a right judgment of things, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts us both in the choice of the fitte&s;t time and the propere&s;t method of doing whatever is to be done. It is one of the greate&s;t misfortunes in the world, to live without any &s;tated rule of conduct, in perpetual di&s;or|der and confu&s;ion. Our life &s;hould be a tran&s;cript of the harmony of the univer&s;e; which could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, much le&s;s attract our admiration, were it not for that ju&s;t proportion, which is di&s;coverable in all its parts. Take away order from the world, and you reduce it to a frightful chaos: Leave man without any other guide than his own pa&s;&s;ions and cap|rice; and there will be nothing but perpetual di&s;cord be|twixt his judgment and his will.</P>
<P>RUIN en&s;ues, when a man exhibits in his own ill-governed mind the mi&s;eries of anarchy: His ideas are confu&s;ed; his imagination is bewildered; his con&s;cience is mi&s;led; his rea&s;on is ob&s;cured; and his &s;oul becomes the &s;eat of confu&s;ion and irregularity.</P>

<P>YOUR father's inclinations were &s;o wi&s;ely regulated, that his behaviour was always influenced by a &s;trict regard to propriety: He knew, with the philo&s;opher, that we ought to weigh the motives of our conduct; and every evening to en|ter into an examination of our actions.</P>
<P>THE man, who lives at random, is a &s;lave to his own whims and caprice. The world reprobates &s;uch an one, as a mon&s;ter which di&s;turbs its harmony; and &s;ociety rejects him, as a being incapable of friend&s;hip. We &s;ee, in &s;hort, that, whoever is thus irregular in his own mind, is de&s;titute of every quality, which can contribute to the ornament or benefit of human life: His mannners are di&s;gu&s;ting, his ex|pen&s;es are exce&s;&s;ive, and his whole conduct unaccountable.</P>

<P>THE exact proportion ob&s;ervable in every work of GOD is intended to teach us, that order is the greate&s;t beauty in na|ture; and that to de&s;pi&s;e this, is to counteract one of the great laws of the Creator of the univer&s;e. Endeavour then,

I be&s;eech you, to imitate in your behaviour that general har|mony in the creation, which, in the cour&s;e of every year, &s;upplies us with whatever is either agreeable or u&s;eful: Let your &s;tudies be methodical, all conducted rather with a view to in&s;truction, than mere amu&s;ement. If you read without a plan, you will overload your memory without improving it: And your knowledge will be little better than an undige&s;ted chaos.</P>
<P>THE mind, in which di&s;order prevails, is, in the eye of rea&s;on, like a city without government, or, a hou&s;e without unanimity. But a per&s;on of this di&s;po&s;ition deceives him&s;elf; and fancies, that if he keeps clear of tho&s;e irregularities, which are offen&s;ive to &s;ociety, he may make him&s;elf ea&s;y, though he has all the rea&s;on in the world to be di&s;&s;atisfied with his way of life.</P>

<P>ALAS! when I was one of the&s;e fa&s;hionable ladies, who&s;e gaiety was an object of envy; I confounded night with day&punc; I knew no law but my own whim; I had no time but for plea&s;ure, no plan but to avoid every thing that was like regularity.</P>
<P>BE a&s;&s;ured, that there is nothing &s;o bewildered, as the life of a per&s;on, given up to the hurry and tumult of the world: Such an one has no &s;en&s;e of the value of time; &s;he knows as di&s;tinction of days, and pays no regard to duty; &s;he &s;tudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fa&s;hions, is wholly taken up with trifles; &s;he delights in that which deba&s;es the mind, and is contrary to rea&s;on; &s;he is

perpetually &s;eeking happine&s;s where it is not to be found; and, though wearied with the pur&s;uit, renews it every day.</P>
<P>THE world is full of per&s;ons always engaged in new pro|jects, and di&s;tracted with new de&s;ires; who die without re|flection, becau&s;e they have lived without any knowledge of them&s;elves. When the mind is thus di&s;ordered, it is afraid to look into it&s;elf; or if it ventures to examine things at all, it only does it &s;uperficially. The &s;en&s;es are &s;o many tyrants, from who&s;e power we are unable to deliver our&s;elves: And nothing appears really valuable, which does not admini&s;ter to their gratification.</P>
<P>MAINTAIN then the dominion over your own minds, that you be not overcome by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which will lay &s;iege to your virtue; your thoughts will then be regulated by wi&s;dom, and you will be rai&s;ed by tho&s;e clouds, which ob&s;cure the light of the under&s;tanding. Each of us may be con&s;idered as an epitome of the world, which is &s;ubject to eclip&s;es, changes of weather, to &s;torms and tempe&s;ts. We all ob&s;erve the &s;trange revolutions, which happen in the univer&s;e; but as Providence, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a multitude of created beings, pre&s;erves the utmo&s;t harmony both in heaven and earth, &s;o ought rea&s;on to pre&s;erve in the human mind the &s;tricte&s;t attention to order and peace. Without this we degrade our&s;elves below the meane&s;t in&s;ect, or even the inanimate parts of the creation; which only &s;ub&s;i&s;t to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which they were made. Behold the bee, or the ant; a thou&s;and times wi&s;er, each of them, than the man who de&s;pi&s;es them. The&s;e never deviate from the laws of their nature, nor from the cour&s;e which Providence has a&s;&s;igned them: It is only by an imitation of their conduct and fore&s;ight, that families are maintained, and kingdoms pre&s;erve their power and &s;plendour.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="029954_0018_0FE3815D658FB518">THIS may &s;erve to convince you, that whatever &s;tate of life you are placed in, it will always be full of di&s;quiet, if your judgment and your pa&s;&s;ions are at variance with each other: You mu&s;t therefore frequently examine into the &s;prings and motives of your conduct, in order to regulate your affections.

<P>WHEN a hou&s;e is on fire, with what eagerne&s;s do we ha&s;ton to put it out! And &s;hall we &s;uffer our pa&s;&s;ions to burn with fury, in the mid&s;t of us; without giving our&s;elves the lea&s;t trouble to extingui&s;h the flame? We &s;eldom reflect that the mind is a kingdom; which cannot be well governed, without a con&s;tant care as well to defend it from its enemies, as to promote whatever may tend to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace and tranquility. Con&s;ider the &s;tars, which &s;hine in their cour&s;es over our heads; con&s;ider the elements which are the &s;ource of life and re&s;piration: Alas! what monitors are the&s;e to man, to be always ready like them to execute the commands of GOD! This view of the creation perpetually reminds us, that every rational creature al&s;o ought to move in his proper &s;phere, and di&s;charge his appointed duty. When we only act as we are influenced by a capricious humour; we in&s;ult the wi&s;dom of a GOD of order, and rai&s;e a perpetual tumult in our own brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I HAVE always ob&s;erved, that per&s;ons of a di&s;&s;ipated turn are as much di&s;ordered with re&s;pect to their affairs, as they are un&s;ettled in their own minds; and leave no inheritance to their children, but debts and law-&s;uits. There is an ea&s;y kind of arithmetick, which every lover of method is acquainted with; and which con&s;i&s;ts in computing our obligations and our nece&s;&s;ities, and our ability to an&s;wer

both, in order to keep our&s;elves within due bounds, and to pay a proper regard to that which may rea&s;onably be expected from us. If you have not this love of method, which I wi&s;h to recommend; you will never be able to regulate your actions, or your families, or your own minds. You will either behave with too great haughtine&s;s, or with too great familiarity, towards your dome&s;tics; you will not di&s;tingui&s;h what is &s;uperfluous from what is nece&s;&s;ary; and for want of calculation, you will have nothing but creditors, or debtors who have nothing to pay.</P>
<P>YOU are born, my children, to a con&s;iderable fortune; but what will become of it, if its u&s;e is not regulated by economy? Riches are ab&s;olute ruin to a di&s;&s;ipated owner: The &s;ame confu&s;ion which di&s;tracts his mind, produces an incon&s;i&s;tency in all his actions; one while you &s;ee an a&s;toni&s;hing prodigality, at another time you are &s;hocked with as unrea&s;onable avarice. He can throw away money, but he cannot give it: He &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rifices every thing to plea&s;ure or to pride, but nothing to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WHEN you are confirmed in this wi&s;e habit of acting methodically, every part of your conduct will be happily adju&s;ted: You will &s;et apart proper &s;ea&s;ons for &s;tudy and for recreation; you will manage your time and your income with prudence; you will di&s;tribute exact ju&s;tice to your neighbours, and you will never engage in any important enterprize, without <HI>con&s;idering the end.</HI> Nothing will ever make you forget the duties which you owe to your character and &s;tation; no day will pa&s;s, in which you will not remem|ber your duty to GOD. We never lo&s;e &s;ight of the&s;e duties, but when we give the preference to a life of irregularity; when we go on without a &s;ingle thought what we are, and what will become of us: Hence it is, that the affections of

<P>"THOUGH you owe the tendere&s;t affection to your mother, you mu&s;t never forget that much is al&s;o due to the country which gave you birth; and which con&s;iders you as its child|ren, and its &s;ubjects: You mu&s;t divide betwixt them tho&s;e &s;entiments of love and re&s;pect, which nature has implanted in your hearts. Nay, I will venture to &s;ay, however jealous I may be of my rights, as your father, that you ought not to he&s;itate in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, whether you &s;hould leave me or not, when your country demands your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Then it is, that, with the heroic &s;elf-denial of a Roman, you mu&s;t &s;acrifice every other con&s;ideration, and po&s;tpone every other intere&s;t to the duty which you owe to your King and country.</P>
<P>"THE fir&s;t character, you &s;u&s;tained, was that of citizens: The &s;tate then recognized you as &s;ubjects, intimately con|nected with it.

She has a right to demand an account of our engagements, and to expect the application of our talents to her advantage. They, therefore, who only employ them&s;elves in the grati|fication of their own vanity, or who lie down in a &s;tate of torpid indolence, can only be con&s;idered as burthens to the &s;tate; or as wa&s;ps, which come to devour the labour of the bees.</P>
<P>"WE are much mi&s;taken, if we imagine our&s;elves at liberty to engage in tho&s;e &s;tudies and employments alone which are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to our&s;elves; the pur&s;uits of one, who wi&s;hes to be called a patriot, ought to be directed only by the love of his country, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote her welfare.

<P>"THE enjoyment of life is by no means equivalent to the honour of dying for our country: For life is but a &s;hadow; whereas the glory which accrues from &s;uch a death, is a light which &s;urvives the ob&s;curity of time, and &s;hines with everla&s;ting brightne&s;s.

as to per&s;onal courage. It is the inward motive, not the outward appearance, which &s;tamps a value upon actions: If in taking up arms we have more regard to our own intere&s;t, than to that of our Country, and if, under a pretence of de|fending the rights of our King and Country, we think only of enriching our&s;elves, we only wear the habit, without hav|ing any portion of the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier.

<P>"THIS confidence is the effect of religion; which purifies the intentions, and influences the will, and is the &s;chool of true magnanimity: Without the motives which religion offers, nothing is to be &s;een but the &s;hadow of virtue.

<P>"YOU can never therefore properly reflect on your noble birth, without being touched with a &s;en&s;e of the duties which it requires of you. If your country gives you credit on account of your ance&s;tors; you ought to exert your&s;elves to the utmo&s;t to di&s;charge the debt, and do honour to their memory. From the fir&s;t moment of your being, the world has expected that you &s;hould be as great as your progenitors, and it is your duty to an&s;wer the&s;e expectations: Otherwi&s;e, the arti&s;an or the labourer will &s;urpa&s;s you in the eyes of your country; and your titles and honours will only &s;erve to make you contemptible.</P>

It is right, that there &s;hould be, in every kingdom, per&s;ons particularly called upon to vindicate the rights of honour and virtue: When we would kindle emulation in the minds of men, we mu&s;t exhibit to them examples worthy of their imitation.

When you make your entrance on the theatre of the world, you mu&s;t expect to be an eye-witne&s;s of the various &s;cenes which it exhibits; and think, with MARCUS AURELIUS, that there is no part, however tragical, which you may not at one time or other be called upon to perform.</P>

May &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e never enter into your minds! May the publick welfare &s;o engro&s;s your attention, as to make you regardle&s;s of your own!

He ought to be told, that our country is a body, which hath equal need of all its members; all of which co-operate in different ways for the general benefit.

How many of both the&s;e orders of men &s;pend their whole lives in the di&s;charge of their re&s;pective duties! They die with le&s;s eclat, I allow, than he who falls in the field of battle: But their death is &s;o much more precious in the &s;ight of GOD, as it continued almo&s;t during their whole life: Every moment of which was a kind of diminution of them|&s;elves, through the continual wa&s;ting of their health and vigour.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE IV. <HI>On</HI> SOCIAL DUTIES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, by the help of your father's invaluable manu&s;cript, in&s;tructed you in your duty to your coun|try, I &s;hall now proceed to tho&s;e obligations which you owe to &s;ociety. Affection &s;upplies me with fre&s;h &s;pirits; and I willingly forget my own weakne&s;s, when your happine&s;s is concerned. My phy&s;icians indeed would fain di&s;&s;uade me from &s;uch exertions of my&s;elf; but their apprehen&s;ions only &s;erve to quicken my zeal to di&s;charge that office, which love and duty towards you in&s;pire.</P>
<P>THOUGH young, you already know enough of the world, to be &s;en&s;ible that there are connections &s;uited to every con|dition of life. And that, to confound the di&s;tinction betwixt each of the&s;e, would be equally contrary to the rules of de|cency and di&s;cretion. In your choice of companions, regard mu&s;t be paid to age, profe&s;&s;ion, and fortune. This di&s;tinction is not the effect of &s;crupulous vanity, but the fruit of a wi&s;e di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>WHAT would you think of a man of quality, who &s;hould only a&s;&s;ociate with the vulgar? Would you not ju&s;tly con&s;ider him, as a contemptible character, and as one who had for|feited the privileges of his birth and education? Providence has appointed diver&s;ities of rank and condition, which we cannot confound without a violation of its laws: The cir|cum&s;tances of your birth were intended to teach you, that you &s;hould connect your&s;elves chiefly with per&s;ons of your
<PB N="35" REF="029954_0024_0FE3818573DE59D0">
own rank, or at lea&s;t with tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the worthine&s;s of their &s;entiments. A &s;imilitude of man|ners, and of inclinations, is the only &s;ure foundation of friend&s;hip among men.</P>
<P>SOCIAL intercour&s;e is not an arbitrary commerce with each other, with which we are at liberty to di&s;pen&s;e, AS we will, and WHEN we will: The &s;everal cla&s;&s;es into which men are divided, are mutually bound to &s;hew re&s;pect, and friend|&s;hip, and good will to one another. If regard is paid to your rank, you mu&s;t, on your part, honour your &s;uperiors: This di&s;tinction &s;erves to maintain harmony in the world; and forms that interchange of true politene&s;s, which cannot be too nicely pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>HE who is really well-bred will &s;hew re&s;pect to his in&s;truc|tors, complai&s;ance to his equals, and conde&s;cen&s;ion to his in|feriors: He will endeavour to accommodate him&s;elf to dif|ferent characters and circum&s;tances. You will never &s;ee &s;uch a one running from one company to another, to carry tales, to broach new opinions, or to &s;lander per&s;ons behind their back. Always obliging, always a friend to truth, he well knows how to reconcile his language with his heart; and never &s;ays a word, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with decency or politene&s;s. He is utterly unacquainted with the art of &s;etting him&s;elf off at the expen&s;e of another: If he choo&s;es to in|dulge a vein of humour, it is only in ridiculing the follies of the age, without any per&s;onal reflections: If he choo&s;es to moralize, it is in &s;o plea&s;ing a manner, that at once he both delights and per&s;uades.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety as well as enjoyment of &s;ociety would be at an end, if every libertine might freely utter his ob&s;cenities, and every athei&s;t his bla&s;phemies; but good manners are a &s;e|curity again&s;t &s;uch offen&s;ive di&s;cour&s;e: And even the mo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="029954_0025_0FE3818A19986DE0">
abandoned is obliged, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, to conceal his vices, and a&s;&s;ume the appearance of virtue. It is only in particular companies, equally reprobated by decency and good &s;en&s;e, that we are in&s;ulted by filthy je&s;ts; and the palm of wit is a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e, who ridicule religion and its mini&s;ters: Such company as this you ought never to be made acquainted with; true merit &s;eeks a more advantageous re&s;idence, than in &s;uch &s;ociety. Whatever re&s;pect you may think due to the different kinds of people with whom you a&s;&s;ociate; take care that you purcha&s;e not the company of others at too dear a price. They have never rightly e&s;timated what is due to &s;ocial life, who &s;acrifice their time, their liberty, and their virtue to it.</P>
<P>SUCH, as divide their whole time betwixt dre&s;s and amu&s;e|ments, are a &s;ort of beings which merely exi&s;t; and who, under a pretence of rendering them&s;elves u&s;eful to the public, only think of gratifying their pride, and di&s;&s;ipating chagri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. It is impo&s;&s;ible to be at re&s;t in our own minds, when we give our&s;elves up to the hurry of the world; private friend&s;hip mu&s;t not be &s;upported at our country's expen&s;e: To the lat|ter we owe much more than to the former, we mu&s;t not there|fore &s;acrifice the one, out of too much complai&s;ance for the other. If there are &s;ome men who do nothing, it is becau&s;e they have no proper &s;en&s;e of their duty to GOD, or to their Country. Complai&s;ance degenerates into weakne&s;s, when we have not re&s;olution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to re&s;i&s;t the importunities of an artful woman, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;olicitations of an idle man: Only make a point of being con&s;tantly well employed, and you will ea&s;ily get rid of this &s;ort of per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t mi&s;chief is, when we do not di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the fa&s;hion of the world, and the duties which we
<PB N="37" REF="029954_0025_0FE3818A19986DE0">
owe to &s;ociety; whereas there is a wonderful difference be|tween them. The one engages us in a train of fooli&s;h ex|pen&s;es, vicious intrigues, and a round of unprofitable idle|ne&s;s; the other makes us u&s;eful and friendly, and offers to us only tho&s;e amu&s;ements which are innocent and proper.</P>
<P>A SOCIABLE man is really a friend to his country; a man of the world (in the &s;en&s;e in which we have ju&s;t now con|&s;idered him) would &s;acrifice his country to his intere&s;t and his plea&s;ures. When this attachment to the world has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, its votaries only exi&s;t for the &s;ake of gratification; and what dependence can there be on a mind that is &s;ubject to the tyranny of plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>HE, who attends to the duties which he owes to &s;ociety, is like a &s;tream, which diffu&s;es it&s;elf through a beautiful meadow; but he, who gives him&s;elf up to the world, is like a torrent, which ha&s;tens to empty it&s;elf into the &s;ea: In the one we di&s;cover nothing but delight, in the other nothing but noi&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d violence. The love of &s;ociety con&s;titutes a part of our duty; the love of the world makes us forgetful of every duty. I have been too well acquainted with this dangerous world; and it is becau&s;e I fooli&s;hly confounded it with ideas of &s;ociety, that I am at pre&s;ent &s;o well able to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt them. Alas! I thought once, there was no being &s;ociable, without being pre&s;ent at every entertainment, at every play, and at every a&s;&s;embly; and I had &s;o thoroughly recon|ciled my&s;elf to this notion, that I &s;hould have looked upon any one, as the mo&s;t &s;tupid and un&s;ociable of all creatures, that did not readily concur with me in my ideas. So power|ful is the love of plea&s;ure, that it puts a fal&s;e interpretation upon every thing, and a&s;&s;umes the language of folly in&s;tead of that of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029954_0026_0FE38191E32D7A58">THIS delu&s;ion, one of the &s;tronge&s;t that can be imagined among per&s;ons of a certain rank, makes them attach them|&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the world, without &s;cruple or re&s;erve: They doat upon it, under the pretext of being &s;ociable; and they per|&s;uade them&s;elves that the unprofitable toil, which it impo&s;es, is a duty which it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to perform.</P>
<P>IT is my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that my own pa&s;t imprudence &s;hould prove u&s;eful to YOU; and that you would not make SOCIETY con&s;i&s;t in any thing, but what it really is; that is to &s;ay, in a polite intercour&s;e, which unites us to each oth|er;&mdash;in friendly vi&s;its, which cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with;&mdash;in letters of civility, which we ought to write;&mdash;and in that nece&s;&s;ary familiarity, which we mutually &s;tand in need of for the purpo&s;es of relaxation: All beyond this, de&s;erves not the name of SOCIETY.</P>
<P>AFTER determining, what it is to be really and properly &s;ociable; it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, how we ought to conduct our&s;elves in the company of others. Many rules have been laid down upon this &s;ubject; and they are plainly reducible to the&s;e: Never to &s;peak, but to the purpo&s;e: Never to rally, but with good humour: Never to appear &s;upercilious: Never to indulge caprice: Never to &s;hew any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with a good heart. Strokes of humour may plea&s;e for a moment; but good &s;en&s;e is always agreeable, and always gives &s;atisfaction: We cannot endure that, which lets us down; and therefore we are much better plea&s;ed with him who only &s;ays common things, than with him who&s;e turn of conver&s;ation is of a &s;uperior kind: Nature is always pref|erable to art.</P>
<P>LEARN to make u&s;e of your wit, without &s;hewing that you are vain of it; the le&s;s you affect to &s;hew it, the more
<PB N="39" REF="029954_0026_0FE38191E32D7A58">
admirers you will find, and the more friends. Equally avoid both raillery and flattery; the one is always con&s;idered as ill-nature, the other pa&s;&s;es for deceit. In former times it was nece&s;&s;ary to prai&s;e in the mo&s;t extravagant terms, in order to attract a &s;mile, or even a gracious look: The ladies of the pre&s;ent age know how ridiculous &s;uch commendations are; and rather than be di&s;gu&s;ted by flattery, they wi&s;h never to be complimented at all. If you are &s;o happy as to have a grave and &s;tudious turn; you will find fewer of the&s;e lo&s;&s;er duties on your hands. All tho&s;e important trifles, which the world calls little attentions (though ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary within proper limits) &s;eem in their extreme to belong only to PETITS MAITRES; becau&s;e every thing, that is in&s;ignifi|cant, is &s;uited to that character. You are undone, if ever you propo&s;e &s;uch as the&s;e for your examples. I never &s;aw one of them, who&s;e mind was not utterly ruined by his folly: They are fit only to afford diver&s;ion, and they always do it at at their own expen&s;e. When the arrival of one of the&s;e gentry is announced, only by the &s;cent of amber and mu&s;k, and when he brings nothing with him but impertinence; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any man of &s;en&s;e can be plea&s;ed with &s;uch company.</P>
<P>IT is by good manners and a genteel air, that others are prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in our favour. Every man has &s;o much &s;elf-love, as to oppo&s;e him, who wi&s;hes to trample upon tho&s;e about him; we love to &s;ee the charms of &s;weetne&s;s in a mode&s;t countenance: While you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e graces, my children, all the world will admire you. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to be &s;ociable, that you be eloquent, or witty, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any rare or &s;uperior talents; all that &s;ociety de|mands of you is, that you be complai&s;ant without meanne&s;s, polite without flattery, &s;teady without rudene&s;s, and &s;prightly
<PB N="40" REF="029954_0027_0FE381968C1D41E0">
without affectation. She requires that you cultivate her, as the friends of mankind; and that you do her honour by an unblemi&s;hed reputation, by decency in your words, and purity in your morals.</P>
<P>A FARTHER knowledge of the world will teach you many particulars, on which my weakne&s;s will not &s;uffer me to en|large. It will furni&s;h you with that gracefulne&s;s, that ea&s;e in your carriage, that politene&s;s, that propriety of behaviour, which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h a per&s;on of fa&s;hion. It will &s;hew you the nece&s;&s;ity of not publi&s;hing &s;tories without caution, of not judging of any performances but with mode&s;ty; and of not &s;peaking of your neighbour's faults, but with re&s;erve. It will teach you that you ought to be neither the fir&s;t to &s;et the fa&s;hion, nor the la&s;t to leave it; and in &s;hort, that you can|not too carefully avoid the imputation of needle&s;s &s;ingularity.</P>
<P>BE careful not to &s;light any per&s;on; yet let your attentions be properly regulated: Nothing is more improper, than to treat a &s;tranger with the intimacy of a friend; or an intimate friend with the di&s;tance due to a &s;uperior. Di&s;tingui&s;h merit wherever you find it, without troubling your&s;elf about the garb in which it appears: Court the company of the learned, and the conver&s;ation of the aged; their di&s;cour&s;e is often more u&s;eful, than any book that you can read. Never argue on a &s;ubject, which you do not under&s;tand; every one admires mode&s;ty; no one can endure conceit. If you are de&s;ired to play for mere amu&s;ement, do not decline it; but never play for the &s;ake of gain: If you are unlucky, you will lo&s;e with good humour, when the &s;take is a matter of indifference: He, that cannot command his temper, never fails to di&s;cover his weakne&s;s, and gives offence to every one about him. Treat the female &s;ex with the utmo&s;t delicacy; they have a
<PB N="41" REF="029954_0027_0FE381968C1D41E0">
claim to the greate&s;t attention. Avoid intrigues; have a &s;trict regard to mode&s;ty: And you will never have a quarrel with any woman.</P>
<P>NEVER promi&s;e any thing without deliberation; but having made a promi&s;e, implicitly ob&s;erve it. Whoever joins the fir&s;t party that comes in his way, without regarding a prior engagement, does not de&s;erve to have friends: Let di&s;cretion con&s;tantly direct your conduct. And if, notwith|&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, you &s;hould meet with ene|mies, they, and not you, will de&s;erve blame.</P>
<P>THE more attention you appear to &s;hew to the&s;e in&s;truc|tions, my children, the more dear you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be to me: and the le&s;s I &s;hall lament the &s;ad &s;eperation which death is preparing to make betwixt us. In leaving you well &s;tored with good principles, and furni&s;hed with my be&s;t ad|vice, I &s;hall think I only lo&s;e you in part; and that I &s;hall be always in &s;ome degree in the mid&s;t of you. It is thus you will be able to find me in your own minds, when you can no longer &s;ee or hear me; and I tru&s;t, you will there find me faithfully repre&s;ented.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE V. <HI>On</HI> VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>A SUCCESSION of fainting fits had exceedingly weakened this pious mother; but, by an exertion worthy of her virtue, and magnanimity, &s;he &s;eemed to forget her bodily weakne&s;s, that &s;he might fully expre&s;s the dictates of her heart. Her children, full of attention, and impre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, looked upon her
<PB N="42" REF="029954_0028_0FE3819EC5C510E8">
with a mixture of admiration and grief; while &s;he commu|nicated this valuable le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction on the &s;ubject of virtue.</P>
<P>VIRTUE, my children, ought to be the ruling principle of all your actions: I cannot but con&s;ider her as the offspring of heaven, without whom there would be nothing in this world but iniquity and impurity. In vain have the mo&s;t corrupt ages of men endeavoured to ob&s;cure her brightne&s;s: She forces her way through the thicke&s;t cloud of pa&s;&s;ions; dif|fu&s;ing tho&s;e rays of glory, which we never can &s;ufficiently admire. Even her enemies are compelled to prai&s;e her; and they who them&s;elves are wicked, if not utterly abandon|ed, would fain be accounted virtuous.</P>
<P>BUT it is not &s;ufficient to bear our te&s;timony in favour of virtue, in empty words; we mu&s;t do her honour by a con|duct which is irreproachable. The eulogium, which we outwardly be&s;tow upon her, mu&s;t be confirmed by the inward di&s;po&s;itions of the heart. You will never be truly great, but in proportion as you are virtuous: The highe&s;t honours are no more than the pede&s;tal; but merit is the &s;tatue erected upon it. This it is, which di&s;tingui&s;hes an individual from the multitude; this it is, which renders him &s;uperior to all that birth and fortune can be&s;tow. Our talents do us hon|our; and wit gains us credit: But Virtue exalts us even above humanity; rai&s;ing us above the events of life, and even above our&s;elves. With her, we &s;ecure the admiration of po&s;terity: We live in the annals of hi&s;tory; we never die: Without her, on the contrary, we are degraded, we grovel, we only exi&s;t, to the di&s;honour of humanity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CONFERENCE VI.</HI> Further In&s;tructions on the &s;ame Subject.</HEAD>
<P>FOUR days had now pa&s;&s;ed, within which this excel|lent lady had not been able to conver&s;e with her chil|dren; but happily her &s;ufferings abated, and &s;he now re|newed her in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee me, &s;ays &s;he, re&s;tored to you for a little time; and it is with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction I avail my&s;elf of this &s;hort re&s;pite, from the plea&s;ing hope of rendering the few remaining hours of my life as u&s;eful to you as po&s;&s;ible. Vir|tue, of which I was &s;peaking, in my la&s;t conference with you, is &s;o fruitful a field, that one might compo&s;e large volumes upon this &s;ubject. O! That I were able to rep|re&s;ent her to you &s;urrounded with that peace which is pecu|liar to her, adorned with tho&s;e charms which di&s;tingui&s;h her, &s;upported by that true greatne&s;s, which is her characteri&s;tic! You would &s;ee that &s;he was formed to be the empre&s;s of the univer&s;e; that &s;he alone de&s;erves our regard; that her &s;ub|lime perfections would have altars erected in every heart, if
<PB N="44" REF="029954_0029_0FE381A394923858">
man were not a dupe to his pa&s;&s;ions: the higher &s;he is rai&s;ed, the more mode&s;t is her deportment; the more charms &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the more &s;tudious is &s;he to conceal them.</P>
<P>IN vain doth vice oppo&s;e her attractions, and declare open war again&s;t her: The remor&s;e, which di&s;turbs the &s;oul of every &s;inner, comes to avenge her cau&s;e, and to teach us that there is no happine&s;s, but what is found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Virtue. Attach your&s;elves therefore clo&s;ely to HER, and you will find that the perfection of happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of her. I never knew what real plea&s;ure was, 'till I became ac|quainted with the worth of virtue, and the greatne&s;s of her beauty. As a proof of this, my deare&s;t children, I can with truth a&s;&s;ure you, that notwith&s;tanding I am on all &s;ides &s;ur|rounded with the &s;hadow of death, I feel an inward joy which I am not able to expre&s;s. This is the pre&s;ent happy effect of my love for virtue; which has taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, that nothing can materially affect me, which hath not &s;ome relation to HER: even You are only &s;o far dear to me, as I tru&s;t you will prove really good and virtuous.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;po&s;ition, however, is the gift of GOD, and cannot be derived from our&s;elves alone; it is therefore the &s;ubject of my con&s;tant prayers, that you may be filled with that grace, which I have &s;o often and &s;o earne&s;tly implored for my&s;elf. No one will be richer than you, if you are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this trea&s;ure; you can then be placed in no &s;ituation of life, in which you will not di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elves by &s;ome laudable action. In each of you, the indigent will find a beneficent father; your family, an equitable and kind ma&s;ter; your relations, an affectionate and generous friend; your country, a zealous &s;upporter; your king, a mo&s;t faithful &s;ubject: In &s;hort, all men will con&s;ider you as their brethren, who only live to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="029954_0029_0FE381A394923858">WHAT a ble&s;&s;ing will riches and honours prove in your hands, if you are really virtuous! You will then become a &s;ource of comfort, perpetually flowing to communicate hap|pine&s;s to all mankind.</P>
<P>YOUR favour will be implored, as though ye were, in &s;ome degree, the mini&s;ters of heaven; and men will ble&s;s you, as doing honour to the age and nation in which you live.</P>
<P>VIRTUE is far from being unrewarded even in this life. What a &s;atisfaction do we feel, in awaking from &s;leep, that we have in our will, and in our power to di&s;tingui&s;h the ap|proaching day, by &s;ome act of mercy to the wretched! How are we delighted with &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e! What tran&s;|port doth the combination of &s;uch virtues afford! The&s;e are the never-failing attendants on good men.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t however beware of confounding natural di&s;po&s;i|tion with the dictates of virtue; we often mi&s;take con&s;titu|tional firmne&s;s, for heroic magnanimity: Vivacity of temper produces courage, as phlegm occa&s;ions prudence. We can only know, by a &s;trict inquiry into our&s;elves, the true motive on which we act. If it is really virtue which excites us, there will be neither affectation, nor &s;everity: Simplicity and moderation will every where appear. They, who carry things to an extreme, know not, that even wi&s;dom it&s;elf mu&s;t be tempered with &s;obriety.</P>
<P>I AM not fond of tho&s;e outrageous virtues, which certain enthu&s;ia&s;ts recommend as the characteri&s;tics of human per|fection. True virtue only &s;hews her&s;elf by a mo&s;t obliging deportment; the more gracious her air is, the more &s;trongly &s;he engages our attachment: We are offended at the &s;ight of a countenance, which is over&s;pread with a cloud of &s;everity.</P>
<P>TAKE care then to exhibit nothing in your outward beha|viour, but what is truly amiable; for otherwi&s;e you will di&s;|figure
<PB N="46" REF="029954_0030_0FE381AAF0D7FF70">
virtue, and make her appear different from what &s;he really is: All, that we add of our own, is only an alloy un|worthy of her purity. It is our misfortune that there is too great a want of &s;incerity among us: Accu&s;tomed from our infancy to di&s;&s;emble, we think nothing excellent, but what is di&s;gui&s;ed; whereas there is no virtue where there is no truth.</P>
<P>LAY this down as a maxim, and you will dete&s;t every &s;pe|cies of di&s;&s;imulation; there is nothing more odious, than a mind en&s;laved to fal&s;ehood, a heart in which duplicity pre|vails. It is better to &s;peak truth, though it &s;hould prove to our own hurt, than to make u&s;e of the lea&s;t equivocation to gain the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>ALL the riches in the world, are not worth one &s;ingle vir|tue: So that if you were allowed to make your choice betwixt the wealth which you are to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and the virtues which I have recommended to you to practi&s;e, you ought not to he&s;itate a moment, which of the&s;e you &s;hould prefer. A man, who is truly virtuous, can never be really wretched. He finds in him&s;elf tho&s;e rich re&s;ources, which even princes are unable to be&s;tow: Always patient and re&s;igned, he do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not find his mind agitated with the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune. His thoughts are rai&s;ed above the &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent life, to the joys of a much happier &s;tate; the &s;ublimity of his &s;entiments renders him &s;uperior to all the calamities, which fortune can inflict.</P>
<P>A SOUL, in which virtue re&s;ides, is the neare&s;t repre&s;enta|tion of heaven it&s;elf: All is &s;erenity, and light, and joy: The troubles of the world cannot interrupt its repo&s;e, the cloud of pa&s;&s;ions cannot dimini&s;h its brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>RELIGION is the only &s;olid foundation of morality: This wi&s;dom is the chief ornament of the human mind, and the chief director of our life. Without this, the heart is degra|ded,
<PB N="47" REF="029954_0030_0FE381AAF0D7FF70">
the whole &s;oul is degenerate; we are di&s;&s;atisfied with our&s;elves, and we have only fools or libertines, for our com|panions and friends.</P>
<P>ASK any man who has preferred a vicious to a virtuous cour&s;e of life; and, if he is &s;incere, he will acknowledge that his unea&s;ine&s;s was continual; that his joy was merely exter|nal: That his imagination was bewildered; that his pa&s;&s;ions con&s;umed him; that his actions brutalized him; and that his whole mind and body were exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>WE need not wait for the coming of that awful day, when GOD &s;hall puni&s;h vice, to know how odious &s;he is: Even in this life &s;he carries with her her own condemnation. Her mo&s;t eloquent and bold panegyri&s;ts, have never been able, with all their endeavours, to cover that deformity, which attends her; and always renders her th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> object of dete&s;tation. Go into any country that you plea&s;e; and you will find vice pro|&s;cribed, and virtue honoured.</P>
<P>IN what ignominious terms doth hi&s;tory make mention of vicious princes! It &s;peaks of them with horror; and never &s;o much as names them, but to make them odious to every age and nation.</P>
<P>A VICIOUS man, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tranger to prudence, decency, and hone&s;ty: He neither reads, nor &s;peaks, nor acts, but with a view to gratify the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions, and bitterly to in|veigh again&s;t virtue, which excites his indignation &s;o much the more, as he finds it impo&s;&s;ible to hate her.</P>
<P>I WOULD not wi&s;h for more than the mere pre&s;ence of a lib|ertine, to fill any reflecting mind with horror. He is a mon|&s;ter, that de&s;troys all the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety; that &s;tifles every worthy &s;entiment; that rebels again&s;t every law of rea&s;on; and that defies Heaven it&s;elf, with a &s;hocking and intolerable in&s;olence.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="029954_0031_0FE381B041733B28">FROM &s;uch dreadful exce&s;&s;es as the&s;e, Virtue, my dear children, will pre&s;erve you: It will not only remove you at a di&s;tance from every &s;inful act, but al&s;o from every occa&s;ion of &s;inning. It will in&s;pire you with an utter aver&s;ion from tho&s;e pre&s;umptuous offenders, who&s;e very breath is infectious; it will encourage you to your &s;everal duties; it will prove the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t idlene&s;s, which is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the pa|rent of every kind of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is no circum&s;tance in life, wherein virtue will not be found u&s;eful; as there is none in which vice can be excu|&s;ed. This religious principle will make us patient in adver&s;i|ty; humble in pro&s;perity; prudent in bu&s;ine&s;s; moderate in plea&s;ures; undaunted in dangers; affable in conver&s;ation; judicious in the management of our dome&s;tic concerns. A man is always acting ami&s;s, when he is not virtuous; his conduct is a &s;atire again&s;t him&s;elf: And he finds only mean and ba&s;e minds, that will venture to applaud him.</P>
<P>WHILE we practi&s;e virtue, we belong, as it were, to Hea|ven: While we lead a di&s;orderly life, we are retained in the &s;ervice of our pa&s;&s;ions. The ob&s;ervance of our duty unites us with good men; the love of vice throws us into the company of the wicked.</P>
<P>THE world will not fail to throw abundance of ob&s;tacles in your way, to hinder your approach to virtue; but the&s;e diffi|culties will pre&s;ently vani&s;h, whenever you enter into an ex|amination of your own hearts: You will then find, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be truly good, without all tho&s;e qualities, which religion demands; you will then find, that the incon&s;tancy of the human mind has need to be fixed by the authority of wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE vivacity of youth is too apt to form a &s;elfe idea of re|ligion, as throwing a veil of melancholy over the world, and
<PB N="49" REF="029954_0031_0FE381B041733B28">
all its plea&s;ures. But &s;uch young people are greatly mi&s;taken: Wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are very con&s;i&s;tent with, if they are not indeed the only &s;ource of cheerfulne&s;s. If you look into the world, and attend carefully to the actions of men, you will find true enjoyment only among tho&s;e who are really vir|tuous: Others indeed may APPEAR with more noi&s;y jollity about them; but this is only a kind of intemperate exce&s;s, which, in a few moments, will give place to an in&s;upportable melancholy. When a man is only joyous by fits and by compul&s;ion, the heart remains a prey to di&s;&s;ipation and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>IF what I have &s;aid to you in recommendation of virtue, is not &s;ufficient to determine you in favour of her charms, re|call to your minds your excellent father; review the hi&s;tory of your illu&s;trious ance&s;tors! And by no means di&s;honour their memory by a conduct &s;o widely different from theirs. The life which you derive from them, &s;hould pa&s;s as incorrupt as theirs: You ought to bear their name, only that you may &s;hew to po&s;terity, that you are &s;o many living repre&s;entatives of their virtues.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, my admonitions will not ea&s;ily be effaced; and that you will &s;tudy that moderation in all things, which con&s;titutes true wi&s;dom. Your minds will never be truly great, except whil&s;t, being &s;teady without boldne&s;s, prudent without avarice, liberal without profu&s;ion, you ennoble every action of your lives. Take heed that you do not, even in &s;e|cret, dive&s;t your&s;elves of that prudence and caution which you outwardly profe&s;s; you mu&s;t never forget, that you ought to be virtuous, for the &s;ake of Virtue, and for the &s;ake of Heaven. A truly good man is he, who acts, as if his whole conduct was open to the &s;ight and examination of GOD and men.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE VII. ON PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>AS GOD, my dear children, is plea&s;ed to prolong my life, and to enable me to continue my in&s;tructions to you; I &s;hall take this opportunity of dwelling more at large on the &s;ubject of Plea&s;ure; the chief rock again&s;t which you are in danger of &s;plitting. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on, in which plea&s;ures pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the imagination, to &s;educe and captivate it. They begin by dazzling our &s;ight; and when once they have &s;ucceeded in this point, they &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the empire of the heart: There they e&s;tabli&s;h their dominion, and choke every &s;eed of virtue.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the inordinate love of plea&s;ure takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, virtue is obliged to retire; we are thenceforth wholly taken up with &s;uch objects as gratify the pa&s;&s;ions, cheri&s;h effeminacy, and &s;upport vanity: We &s;eek for nothing but mi&s;chievous indulgencies, we li&s;ten only to the dictates of our &s;en&s;ual appetites.</P>
<P>THERE is no man, who is not fond of ea&s;e and tranquilli|ty: This principle is &s;o deeply imprinted in our minds, that we mu&s;t dive&s;t our&s;elves of our nature, before we can think otherwi&s;e. But by TRANQUILLITY OF MIND&punc; I mean that pure &s;atisfaction, which has nothing in common with tho&s;e gratifications, in which the world chiefly delights: For you cannot be too often told, that the plea&s;ures which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pur|&s;ues, as its &s;overeign good, are only phantoms which mi&s;lead us.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="029954_0032_0FE381BC129E4410">I AM no &s;tranger to the&s;e boa&s;ted delights: I have been &s;uf|ficiently engaged in their vain pur&s;uit; and from my own ex|perience I can with truth declare, that they only &s;erve to lull rea&s;on to &s;leep. It is, in &s;hort, a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, which terminates in remor&s;e; a dream, from which, when we a|wake, we find a VACUUM, which we are not able to &s;upply. I always fancied, that they would fill my heart with the mo&s;t perfect joy; and I found my&s;elf con&s;tantly di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;oul drink ever &s;o largely of this cup, it nev|er finds that inward &s;atisfaction, which leaves nothing further to be de&s;ired: We never can be completely happy, whil&s;t we are under the government of our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IF I had time and ability to analyze tho&s;e plea&s;ures to which the world is en&s;laved, I could demon&s;trate to you the in&s;uffici|ency of public diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements, to give real &s;atisfac|tion to a rational mind. It is &s;ufficient to know that they are trifling, that they are fatiguing, that they are tran&s;ient; where|as the &s;oul can find no real happine&s;s in that, which is not &s;ub|&s;tantial, peaceful, and unchangeable. We always therefore of|fer violence to our better part, when we launch forth into that tumultuous ocean of trifles, which con&s;titute the life of peo|ple of fa&s;hion. It is only by &s;tifling reflection, that the lov|ers of plea&s;ure can &s;upport them&s;elves: they well know that a little &s;erious con&s;ideration would give them a di&s;ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures which they are pur&s;uing, and therefore they do every thing they can to get rid of it. Thus do they live in a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">norance even of their own minds.</P>
<P>HOW often does the theatre, which we are fond of calling the &s;chool of true politene&s;s and ju&s;t &s;entiments, carry us away from our&s;elves, and render us the &s;laves of pa&s;&s;ion! It is gene|rally love, which performs the principle character, and which
<PB N="52" REF="029954_0033_0FE381C0E03E5178">
is repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t alluring manner: We &s;eldom attend, I believe, to what is pa&s;&s;ing there, without returning more enamoured with the world, more pa&s;&s;ionately fond of dre&s;s, more &s;trongly inclined to di&s;&s;ipation. The glaring appearance of the &s;tage, the &s;entiments there delivered, and the objects exhibited, all &s;erve to enchant the &s;en&s;es, excite the pa&s;&s;ions, intoxicate the mind, and encourage the love of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THINK not, I a&s;&s;ume the language of a preacher; mine is only that of rea&s;on and experience. The theatre is very fre|quently the ruin of young men, whom the &s;ight of an actre&s;s &s;educes, and carries headlong into every &s;pecies of mi&s;chief. From that moment, all dome&s;tic attachments are at an end; all relative duties are neglected; a total di&s;order in their af|fairs &s;ucceeds, and they become the &s;ubject of public conver|&s;ation, and the authors of ruin to them&s;elves and to their families.</P>
<P>I DEFY the advocates for the&s;e entertainments to deny the facts, ju&s;t mentioned. Alas! what I have &s;aid is too frequent|ly verified, to que&s;tion the truth of it. In vain are we told, that the tears, which we &s;hed in the theatre, teach us to be compa&s;&s;ionate; the momentary tenderne&s;s, excited by ro|mance, &s;eldom, if ever, materially affects the heart. Some, who are ju&s;t come from a &s;cene, at which they were almo&s;t di&s;&s;olved into tears, could with dry eyes behold the wretch, who, in want of every comfort, implores their pity and relief.</P>
<P>ASSEMBLIES have &s;o often proved the occa&s;ions of in|trigues and duels, that I cannot venture to recommend them to you. It is certainly very proper, that a young man of fa&s;hion &s;hould know how to introduce him&s;elf, at &s;uch places; and particularly that he &s;hould be able to dance gracefully. But it is al&s;o al&s;o very nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould know, that
<PB N="53" REF="029954_0033_0FE381C0E03E5178">
of all qualifications, dancing is the lea&s;t con&s;iderable: That a man of &s;cience looks on it with an eye of pity; and that an officer ought neither too curiou&s;ly to &s;tudy it, nor too earne&s;t|ly engage in it: It is the property of per&s;ons of a trifling cha|racter, to be wholly occupied by trifles.</P>
<P>AS to play; there is no &s;pecies of it, which does not &s;tand in need of &s;ome apology to excu&s;e it. At be&s;t, it &s;hews a fee|blene&s;s of mind, which is incapable of proper application; and occa&s;ions a lo&s;s of time which it is impo&s;&s;ible to redeem: You mu&s;t never con&s;ider it, but as a nece&s;&s;ary recreation, and an act of civility which you owe to &s;ociety. But lay this down as a maxim, that the money, which we win, &s;eldom does us the lea&s;t good; and that the lo&s;s of our money &s;eldom fails to di&s;concert us.</P>
<P>OF games of hazard I &s;ay nothing; they are &s;o dangerous that I am per&s;uaded you will mo&s;t carefully avoid them: In the&s;e, men either lo&s;e their reputation, or their fortune, or both. And however rich they may &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves; from the moment they commence game&s;ters, they can never in&s;ure their being worth a &s;hilling: A &s;ingle throw often reduces an opulent man to ab&s;olute beggary.</P>
<P>I AM, perhaps, wrong, in reckoning play in the number of plea&s;ures; it certainly has much more the appearance of &s;tu|dy, than of recreation. The eyes fixed, the attention engro&s;&s;|ed, a deep &s;ilence, a re&s;tle&s;s inquietude ari&s;ing from the fear of lo&s;ing or the hopes of gain, exclude the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of plea&s;ure. This is the &s;tate of all who lo&s;e. They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ull of care, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of complaints, they torment them&s;elves; and when they are &s;een PLAYING, to &s;ay the truth, they do every thing but PLAY.</P>
<P>AS for fea&s;ts: They are only our ordinary meals, embel|li&s;hed by elegance and a variety of meats. They may &s;erve to
<PB N="54" REF="029954_0034_0FE381C8B4B10380">
remind us, that this body of ours is a &s;lave, that has a great many wants to be &s;upplied, and that all the&s;e kinds of food, with which our vanity is fed, were originally de&s;igned merely for a remedy again&s;t death. It is a &s;ure indication of a de|generate mind, when any man makes his happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in the plea&s;ure of eating.</P>
<P>DO not imagine, my dear children, that I have the lea&s;t de|&s;ire of making you un&s;ociable, or moro&s;e. My intention is only to in&s;pire you with elevated &s;entiments; to teach you the true value of things; that you may not mi&s;take tin&s;el for gold; but that you may u&s;e this world as not abu&s;ing it: And that you may be a&s;&s;ured, that a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of your duty, is the only &s;ource of real plea&s;ure; that to reach forth comfort to the mi&s;erable gives the true&s;t &s;atisfaction; and furni&s;hes the mind with that enjoyment, which no enter|tainments or diver&s;ions can afford.</P>
<P>CAN there be a more pitiable object than one who&s;e whole happine&s;s depends on a fox chace, a concert, or a play? Should either of the&s;e fail him, he is undone: Or, if by chance he &s;hould be &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to be out of the reach of them, he is &s;o mi&s;erable, that his exi&s;tence is a bur|then to him.</P>
<P>WHO, on the contrary, is more happy than he who, fur|ni&s;hed with the means of amu&s;ing &s;olitude, can &s;it down and reli&s;h the plea&s;ures of reading and contemplation? Such a man goes out into the world merely for recreation, and to di&s;|charge the duties which he owes to &s;ociety: He con&s;iders the public amu&s;ements as incidental means of relaxation; but can never be induced to &s;et his heart on &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s trifles.</P>
<P>AS your military life may often oblige you to live in coun|tries very ill &s;upplied even with common nece&s;&s;aries, you mu&s;t accu&s;tom your&s;elves to be well &s;atisfied, wherever you are. In
<PB N="55" REF="029954_0034_0FE381C8B4B10380">
order to which, reflect, that the mind is the principal object, which de&s;erves your attention; and that if you cultivate the growth of virtue in your hearts, you will have within your|&s;elves a never failing &s;ource of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THE diver&s;ions of the field are certainly amu&s;ing; the charms of mu&s;ic are unque&s;tionably great; but our attach|ment to either, falls little &s;hort of madne&s;s, if we &s;uffer them to engro&s;s our whole time, or our be&s;t affections. It is tem|perance, which mu&s;t give a reli&s;h even to our plea&s;ures; and which alone renders them worthy of a rational &s;oul. When we would be always amu&s;ed, we lo&s;e the idea of amu&s;ement; even what is mo&s;t delicious becomes in&s;ipid, by being con|&s;tantly within our reach. Every thing grows dull to that heart, which is a prey to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; every unnece&s;&s;ary refinement made u&s;e of to whet the appetite for plea&s;ure, pro|duces a painful &s;atiety. If you only con&s;ider recreation, as the remedy of fatigue, it will be very ea&s;y to find amu&s;e|ment: Studied plea&s;ures are only for tho&s;e, who&s;e appetites are in a manner exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>AS you are now arrived at an age, in which your pa&s;&s;ions begin to &s;hew them&s;elves; guard with the utmo&s;t care again&s;t every thing which may corrupt your morals, or di&s;turb your tranquillity. Youth is the torrid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne of life; and the irregu|lar love of women the &s;ource of inquietude and misfortunes. Hi&s;tory abounds with in&s;tances of tho&s;e ravages which it is continually making: It pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us under the attractive idea of plea&s;ure; but it &s;oon becomes a torment, which di&s;orders the imagination, di&s;tracts the mind, and tyrannizes over the heart.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is thoroughly &s;ubject to its power, is always ready to violate the mo&s;t &s;acred duties: He forgets his friends,
<PB N="56" REF="029954_0035_0FE381CE12903E38">
his country, and his GOD; he &s;ees nothing but the object of his pa&s;&s;ion; he hearkens to nothing but the voice of his un|bridled de&s;ires.</P>
<P>IN this dreadful &s;ituation you will be &s;ure to find your|&s;elves, if you know not how to fill up your time in a proper manner. The pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be &s;ubdued by the &s;tubbornne&s;s of labour; and temptation mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted, by avoiding the occa&s;ions of it: We are &s;ure of being lo&s;t, whenever we &s;eek for danger. The mi&s;eries of lu&s;t may be read in the very faces of tho&s;e, who give them&s;elves up to it. Nothing ex|hau&s;ts and enervates like debauchery; it de&s;troys at once the under&s;tanding and the health.</P>
<P>YOU will tell me, perhaps, that by my &s;y&s;tem of morality ALL plea&s;ures are forbidden: No, my children, there are many recreations, which virtue allows; and in which you will find &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction, when you only &s;eek them for the &s;ake of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>A SOCIAL game at cards, cheerful conver&s;ation, an even|ing walk, an intere&s;ting book, a game at tennis, or a day's hunting, a dinner with your friends, and innocent mirth&mdash; the&s;e &s;hould be your amu&s;ements. And the&s;e will have charms enough, if you know the nature of true plea&s;ure; I mean that, which is not purcha&s;ed with pain or remor&s;e; and which, leaving the mind at all times in the &s;ame ea&s;y &s;tate in which it found it, is under no apprehen&s;ion of &s;hame, nor fears the cen&s;ures of mankind.</P>
<P>IF a libertine would venture to calculate all the difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, which he is under, to di&s;gui&s;e his con|duct from the eyes of men, and to conceal his &s;hame from his parents or his friends, he would &s;ee that his life is a con|tinual torment: And that the wretched privilege of ruining
<PB N="57" REF="029954_0035_0FE381CE12903E38">
his con&s;titution, and de&s;troying his life, is purcha&s;ed with endle&s;s vexations. In vain does he &s;helter him&s;elf from the reproaches of men; GOD &s;ees him and his crimes, in the very moment of commi&s;&s;ion; and they are written in that everla&s;ting book, in which all our actions are recorded.</P>
<P>FREQUENTLY reflect, I be&s;eech you, on what I have &s;aid; and you will find, that true &s;atisfaction con&s;i&s;ts only in an upright attention to your duty. A mind &s;o compo&s;ed will receive plea&s;ure even from a &s;ight of a flower beginning to di&s;clo&s;e its beauties, or from a murmuring &s;tream; or even from viewing the formation of the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect. A reflect|ing mind improves every contemplation of the wonderful works of the Creator; it finds numberle&s;s beauties in tho&s;e objects, which pa&s;s unnoticed by per&s;ons of a di&s;&s;ipated turn.</P>
<P>WHAT delight is the pro&s;pect of a flowery meadow capable of affording to a mind un&s;ullied by vice! What &s;atisfaction does a tender and a virtuous heart feel, from the con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of a good action! Such as the&s;e are the plea&s;ures, which I wi&s;h you to experience: We are always independent, when we have the re&s;ources of entertainment within our&s;elves. He, who is always running about in &s;earch of happine&s;s, &s;eldom finds any thing more than the &s;hadow of it.</P>
<P>LET your minds then open them&s;elves to the plea&s;ures, which virtue offers to your acceptance; and think, that, as effeminacy is the parent of chagrin, you will no longer be able to &s;upport your&s;elves than while you are fond of labour, and know how to diver&s;ify it. This variety tends admirably to hinder di&s;ta&s;te; nothing being &s;o tedious as an uniform &s;ame|ne&s;s of employment.</P>
<P>WHILST you carefully avoid the company of libertines, I am &s;ure you will be &s;afe; but if once you a&s;&s;ociate with them, you will infallibly become a prey to vice: Their con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="58" REF="029954_0036_0FE381D66FCB7558">
tends only to &s;educe, and their examples are infec|tious. Accu&s;tomed to receive, from the mo&s;t plau&s;ible writers, whatever can in&s;pire them with the love of plea&s;ure; they prai&s;e, extol, and recommend them wherever they go; as a cloud &s;catters hail, or rain, over every country through which it pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that you have need of re&s;olution. But what is a man, that is driven about with every wind? Who can be good with &s;uch as are good, and a libertine with &s;uch as are di&s;&s;olute; in &s;hort, who has no inclinations or purpo&s;e of his own. If you think my advice tends only to render your life melancholy; you will neither do ju&s;tice to my affection, nor to my di&s;cernment. Adopt the mea&s;ures which I recom|mend; and you will very &s;oon know, by experience, that as your happine&s;s is the only earthly object of my care; &s;o I am neither mi&s;taken in the end, nor in the means which I point out to you, of effecting it. The voice of a mother, &s;o deeply intere&s;ted as I am in your welfare, is not the voice of treachery. Death, approaching, begins to open my eyes; and imparts to me new rays of light: It de&s;troys indeed my bodily &s;trength, but it increa&s;es the powers of my under|&s;tanding. It redoubles my love of tho&s;e, whom I con&s;ider as a part of my&s;elf, which will &s;oon &s;urvive me; and, as it were, &s;ecure to me a continuance on that earth, on which I &s;hall no longer per&s;onally exi&s;t.</P>
<P>IF any thing can afford me comfort in death, it will be the confidence, that you will con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erve my precepts. Promi&s;e me, therefore, my beloved children, with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as a &s;en&s;e of duty will &s;ugge&s;t; promi&s;e me on the truth of a &s;oldier, who&s;e word of honour is mo&s;t &s;a|cred; promi&s;e me that you will conform your lives to the rules which I have here laid down, and that you will
<PB N="59" REF="029954_0036_0FE381D66FCB7558">
not di&s;honour my memory by an irregular and vicious conduct.</P>
<P>HERE the children of our excellent mother ca&s;t them&s;elves at her feet: And in the mid&s;t of tears and &s;ighs prote&s;ted, that their lives &s;hould be exactly &s;uch, as &s;he had marked out to them; and that they had rather die in her pre&s;ence, than make her &s;uch promi&s;es, as they did not mean to per|form. Each of them embraced her in the tendere&s;t manner; after which the generous parent fini&s;hed her conference by &s;aying, in a &s;teady, but interrupted tone of voice&mdash;</P>
<P>I RECEIVE your protection with the utmo&s;t comfort: I would make it known, that it might be a witne&s;s again&s;t you, if you &s;hould ever counteract your own &s;olemn engage|ments. The world, corrupt as it is, would then &s;hew, that it has virtue enough to &s;et it&s;elf again&s;t you, and vindicate my rights: But in &s;o doing, I &s;hould think I di&s;honoured you by my unju&s;t apprehen&s;ions. Only remember, that no one, without GOD'S a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace, can attain to any thing which is good; and that you &s;tand in need of &s;uccour from Heaven, to enable you to put in practice what you have promi&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE VIII. <HI>On</HI> AMBITION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS evening &s;hall be employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the manu|&s;cript which your father left you; let us give it that attention, which it de&s;erves............</P>
<P>THE love of honour being the pa&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons of rank, and e&s;pecially of &s;oldiers; it is very nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould
<PB N="60" REF="029954_0037_0FE381DBF1265238">
be taught the be&s;t means of regulating it. If it has no bounds, it becomes an head-&s;trong vice; which is ready to &s;acrifice families, provinces, and kingdoms, nay, even the whole univer&s;e to its own intere&s;t. Ma&s;&s;acres, wars, depre|dations of every kind, take their ri&s;e only from a fal&s;e ambi|tion: When this affection of the mind is improved into a &s;y&s;tem, we no longer regard the law, our country, or our GOD.</P>
<P>I HAVE never been able to read the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e wretch|ed people without horror; who, to &s;atisfy their inordinate de&s;ires, have effected the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of a whole nation, and fea&s;ted their eyes and their hearts with the dreadful &s;pectacle. They are mon&s;ters, which de&s;erved to have been buried in oblivion: Hi&s;tory ought not even to have tran&s;mitted their names to our remembrance. Immortality is the reward of virtue alone; as for wickedne&s;s, it is worthy to be con&s;igned to that darkne&s;s, whence it proceeded.</P>
<P>THERE is a kind of ambition, which we call emulation; and which, having nothing in its view but the public good, or its own advancement, according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of equity and honour, mu&s;t needs be con&s;idered as a virtue. Without this &s;pecies of ambition, our faculties would be benumbed, our talents would remain buried; there would be no enter|pri&s;e, or di&s;covery in the world: Men, reduced to a level with the brute creation, would live without rule and without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>IT was the de&s;ign of Providence, that our own private inte|re&s;t &s;hould be intimately connected with that of the public; and that the general good &s;hould be promoted by the exertion of each man's particular abilities. Every one &s;eems to be la|bouring for him&s;elf; and yet this labour, though SELF ap|pears to be the immediate object, &s;oon unites with the com|mon
<PB N="61" REF="029954_0037_0FE381DBF1265238">
ma&s;s of indu&s;try: And thus is compo&s;ed that u&s;eful body of men, who maintain the &s;trength and magnificence of the &s;tate, at the hazard of their lives, or by the &s;weat of their brows.</P>
<P>WE are no where forbidden to keep our own advancement in our view; but we are at all times required to prefer the public good before our private intere&s;t: And while we are le&s;s concerned about our own advantage, than about that of our country, we &s;hall never de&s;ire any thing, but what is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. When either arrogance or avarice &s;o far prevails, as to make us with to appropriate to our&s;elves the prai&s;es and rewards, which are not our due, we then become u&s;urpers, and cea&s;e to be worthy citizens.</P>
<P>AMBITION is a pa&s;&s;ion, which runs into every extreme: One while it deba&s;es him, who is en&s;laved to it; at another time it exalts him above mea&s;ure: It is the parent of pride on one hand, and of meanne&s;s on the other. Of this &s;ort are tho&s;e ob&s;equious wretches, who bow them&s;elves at the feet of &s;uch as are able to promote them; while they treat tho&s;e with contempt, from whom they have nothing to expect.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t be well acquainted with the ambitious, if we would be competent judges of the mi&s;eries they endure. We &s;hould then &s;ee what variety of projects, what a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, fills their imagination: How their minds are di&s;tracted with hopes and fears; how continually they are de|luded with the phantom of glory, which &s;uddenly vani&s;hes away; and which makes the ambitious man think him&s;elf perpetually on the brink of happine&s;s, without ever actually attaining to it. Scarce is one of his de&s;ires gratified, when a &s;econd pre&s;ents it&s;elf: His heart, like the ve&s;&s;el of the DANAIDES, can never be filled; he is like another TAN|TALUS,
<PB N="62" REF="029954_0038_0FE381E4654A0D10">
who&s;e thir&s;t is never to be quenched. What a lamentable &s;tate is this!</P>
<P>WHETHER it is the de&s;ign of Providence to &s;top the ambitious in his career, or whether he is exhau&s;ted by his own de&s;ires; I have &s;een a multitude of young people, hur|ried away by this pa&s;&s;ion, peri&s;h in the mid&s;t of their projects of grandeur and advancement. Alas! will there not be earth enough to &s;upply us with a grave; and mu&s;t we be ince&s;&s;antly reminded, that this life is &s;o &s;hort and tran&s;itory, that there is not time to form de&s;igns, and to &s;ee them exe|cuted?</P>
<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem, that the honours with which men feed their imagination, mu&s;t needs be eternal; and yet&mdash;a &s;ingle moment is &s;ufficient to put an end both to them and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The earth is covered with in&s;criptions, which announce the tran&s;itory condition of human grandeur: We &s;pend our whole lives in de&s;iring that promotion, at which we never arrive; or, at lea&s;t, not before the eve of death. Truly it was well worth our while, to torment our&s;elves night and day, about what is &s;o full of uncertainty, and of &s;o &s;hort duration!</P>
<P>THERE is only one &s;ort of ambition, which I can venture to recommend to you; that of imitating your ance&s;tors, and of &s;erving your country with a zeal which nothing can di|mini&s;h. In every thing el&s;e, let moderation &s;et bounds to your de&s;ires: He is worthy of every thing, who thinks he de&s;erves nothing.</P>
<P>THEY who are continually complaining of the inju&s;tice done them, becau&s;e their merit is not properly attended to, are men of a mo&s;t ignoble &s;pirit: We adopt a very different language, when we feel in our minds that genero&s;ity of &s;en|timents,
<PB N="63" REF="029954_0038_0FE381E4654A0D10">
which rai&s;es us above the caprice of fortune. The mere &s;atisfaction of having honourably &s;erved the public, is of more value, than every kind of recompence. We mu&s;t put our&s;elves in a &s;ituation to hope for every thing from Heaven; this will prove the be&s;t ground of comfort, amid&s;t all the inju&s;tice of men.</P>
<P>I SHOULD be very mi&s;erable, if I thought you could only ri&s;e, by means of intrigue. Shew on all occa&s;ions a gene|rous greatne&s;s of mind, which rai&s;es you above all the little artifices, and ba&s;e compliances, which ambition &s;tudies. Habituate your&s;elves to de&s;ire no other advancement, than that which may ari&s;e from the performance of your duty; choo&s;e rather to live in ob&s;curity, than to &s;hine with a bor|rowed lu&s;tre. If we would be really honoured by the digni|ties conferred on us, we mu&s;t never be a&s;hamed to declare, by what means we attained to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: True honour con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in obtaining promotion, as in having de&s;erved it. Tho&s;e titles, with which a man of fa&s;hion is di&s;tingui&s;hed, no longer afford him any real &s;atisfaction than while they are confirmed by the public approbation.</P>
<P>IF you love the truth, as I tru&s;t you always will, you will be utter &s;trangers to flattery and duplicity; but you mu&s;t expect in return, that fortune, who be&s;tows the chief of her favours on compliance and deceit, will not reckon you in the number of her favourites. You will then be great, only in the way which is proper for you; true glory will never leave you. You will find, in your&s;elves, tho&s;e honours and riches, which are not to be found in courts; and you will have this &s;atisfaction, that neither injuries nor death it&s;elf will be able to take any thing from you.</P>
<P>IT is time for you, my children, to &s;hew to the world an example of true magnanimity: The hearts of too many are
<PB N="64" REF="029954_0039_0FE381E9E43A5E48">
&s;o deba&s;ed, that they only think how they may arrive at honours, without concerning them&s;elves whether the means are generous and lawful. Envy, which always forms an at|mo&s;phere round virtuous characters, will perhaps con&s;ider you as proud; but what doth calumny avail, again&s;t a con|&s;cience void of offence? It is then we wrap our&s;elves up in our integrity; and are contented to defy malevolence Who|ever re&s;olutely devotes him&s;elf to the practice of virtue, will not fail to have enemies; &s;o invariably is it the lot of real merit to be per&s;ecuted, that it is laid down as an axiom, that it mu&s;t be &s;o.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;ufficient to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of military courage. You mu&s;t have a &s;trength of mind, which extends it&s;elf to every part of your conduct; which rai&s;es you above all the rumours of malice and envy; which makes you de&s;pi&s;e re|ports and cabals; and which renders you invulnerable to the &s;hafts of ingratitude and revenge.</P>
<P>DO not imagine that, under the pretext of elevating your minds, I wi&s;h &s;o to deba&s;e them, as to make you indifferent to every in&s;ult which may be offered to you: All I have to &s;ay on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, is, that your own prudence mu&s;t be your chief defence. By being affable and well-bred, you will avoid tho&s;e dreadful rencounters, in which we know what we ought to do, but do not know what we &s;hall be compelled to do.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may happen to you, never forget, that every &s;ubject owes his life to his king and country; and that YOU doubly owe your's, both as citizens and &s;oldiers. You are appointed by the &s;tate as centinels, to watch in its defence; the pre&s;ervation therefore of your own lives is a nece&s;&s;ary part of your duty.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="029954_0039_0FE381E9E43A5E48">IF a trial mu&s;t be made of your per&s;onal courage, war will furni&s;h you with abundant opportunities of &s;hewing it.

When you have only de&s;ires of this kind, virtue will &s;ecure them, and crown them with ble&s;&s;ing and good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE duties of a &s;oldier are the propere&s;t to excite emula|tion; they never want opportunities to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves.

Let merit alone &s;peak in your be|half; and leave it to tho&s;e who wi&s;h you well, to give it its proper weight. Your attendance at court will not then be irk&s;ome to you; and courtiers will not look upon you with a jealous eye. As you will not have any preten&s;ions, you will have no inducement to act a part; and this &s;implicity and ea&s;e being &s;omething uncommon, will perhaps more &s;trongly recommend you than di&s;&s;imulation.

<HEAD>CONFERENCE IX. <HI>On</HI> GENEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often thought that amid&s;t all the different modes of educating young people, they have never been &s;uffici|ently in&s;tructed in the nature of true Genero&s;ity. To &s;upply this defect, I intend to &s;hew you, that there is nothing which rai&s;es us to a nearer re&s;emblance to the Deity, than the prac|tice of this duty. We become imitators of that Providence, which di&s;pen&s;es its bounty with profu&s;ion; and we re&s;emble tho&s;e beneficial clouds, which di&s;til plenty on every part of the earth.</P>
<P>THE &s;pendthrift is as far from genero&s;ity as the mi&s;er: They are both of them beings, who have nothing in view but their own gratifications, without any regard to the nece&s;&s;ities of their neighbour. The one throws his money away, and the other locks it up; but mi&s;ery receives no con&s;olation from either. There is no virtue, where there is neither di&s;cretion, nor any regard for the public good: Whatever has nothing better than vanity for its principle, is certainly far from being worthy of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT indeed would become of us, if our &s;entiments were wholly under the influence of caprice! Nothing but folly and &s;ingularity would be found among men; and that attention to the public welfare, which ought to direct our &s;entiments and conduct, would in&s;en&s;ibly come to nought. It is the law of prudence and of rea&s;on, which determines the u&s;e we ought to make of our talents and abilities; and it is only in following this law, that we advance towards perfection, and do honour to humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029954_0041_0FE381F740CA54E0">RICHES are either an honour, or a di&s;grace, to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them; it is a real misfortune to be rich, when we know not how to u&s;e our riches. I had infinitely rather leave you in a &s;tate of indigence, than know, that you were either covetous or extravagant. Avarice renders us the objects of public indignation; prodigality carries us headlong into a thou&s;and difficulties. It is genero&s;ity alone, which ob&s;erves the happy medium betwixt both; which renders us worthy partakers of earthly and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings; provided it is the work of the heart, and not the effect of humour or o&s;|tentation.</P>
<P>WHAT delight does it afford one, to &s;ee a generous noble|man, who, giving every thing to beneficence, and nothing to vanity, finds re&s;ources in frugality, for the &s;upply of the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of his friend, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an indigent widow, or the con&s;olation of the unfortunate! Such a &s;ight as this ad|dre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to the heart; and with a power ten thou&s;and times more affecting than any theatrical repre&s;entation, awakens all the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul, and rai&s;es it above hu|manity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>EXHIBIT to the world, my dear children, &s;uch a character as this; con&s;ecrate a part of your income to the benefit of your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow-creatures. Let your liberality extend it|&s;elf, wherever the mi&s;eries of others are urgent; adapt your bounty to the different degrees of wretchedne&s;s: When cir|cum&s;tances demand it, be generous according to the extent of your ability, and the exigency of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>TRUE genero&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in giving with propriety: The manner of di&s;pen&s;ing is oftentimes more plea&s;ing than the gift it&s;elf. A man, who gives with an ungracious air, de&s;troys all the merit of his benefaction: If you would oblige by your genero&s;ity, you mu&s;t &s;hew the party whom you &s;erve, that you
<PB N="69" REF="029954_0041_0FE381F740CA54E0">
think it more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive. A liberal man &s;ets a greater value on gold, chiefly becau&s;e it enables him to relieve the nece&s;&s;itous.</P>
<P>I HAVE often &s;een your father give large &s;ums of money to the truly di&s;tre&s;t; and perceived that he was more delighted with &s;uch an act, than he could have been by any favour conferred upon him&s;elf. He felt, in his heart, that there is no &s;atisfaction equal to the plea&s;ure of obliging others. Oh! if he were now in&s;tructing you in my &s;tead, with what earne&s;tne&s;s of affection would he encourage you to adopt his &s;entiments, and imitate his practice! How often hath the generous tear of pity fallen from his eyes, at the &s;ight of a mi&s;erable object! Many a time has he led me to the habita|tions of the wretched, to teach me a proper regard for the poor, and to excite my de&s;ire to comfort them. He &s;ought the company of &s;uch as needed relief; he conver&s;ed freely with them as with brethren: He became a party in their &s;ufferings by a friendly &s;ympathy, and filled their hearts with con&s;ola|tion and joy.</P>
<P>SO bright an example mu&s;t needs engage your reverence and imitation. You are under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to &s;hew tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have experienced the goodne&s;s of your father, that his virtues have de&s;cended to you, and that you are not degenerate: Otherwi&s;e, you will only be de&s;pi&s;ed, and will be con&s;idered as unworthy of that inheritance which he has left you.</P>
<P>YOU live in an age, wherein luxury dries up the &s;ource of liberality: That we may give full &s;cope to our vanity, we have nothing left for the relief of mi&s;ery. We do not inquire, how much we can &s;pare for acts of mercy; but what will en|able us to gratify our pa&s;&s;ion for the mo&s;t expen&s;ive plea&s;ures? As for genero&s;ity, it pa&s;&s;es with &s;ome for a romantic virtue:
<PB N="70" REF="029954_0042_0FE381FE20AEED98">
and yet I will venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that it is as e&s;&s;ential to a man of quality as courage; and that it even makes a part of hone&s;ty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>YOU will never be truly great, but &s;o long as greatne&s;s is the principle of your actions. Every thing is little in a noble|man, who is not generous: His ideas are little, his &s;enti|ments are mean. The &s;oul grows narrow and confined, when we are thinking only of oeconomy; we mu&s;t know how to &s;pend, and how to give.</P>
<P>GENEROSITY is a virtue, which fore&s;ees evil, and endea|vours to prevent it; which embraces every opportunity of do|ing good, and is awakened by the fir&s;t complaint of the mi&s;|erable. Li&s;ten only to her dictates, and you will liberally re|compence tho&s;e who &s;erve you; you will be ready to lend, and will know no greater &s;atisfaction, than when you are re|lieving your neighbour. It is &s;hocking, to &s;ee men prefer &s;o worthle&s;s a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as money, before the life of their bro|ther; or to &s;ee them make u&s;e of their riches, only to feed their vanity and pride. I had rather your hou&s;e were without furniture, and your wardrobe without clothes; than that you &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of the poor. But gen|ero&s;ity, which runs not to &s;uch exce&s;s, and is duly mindful of mea&s;ure and proportion, will &s;ugge&s;t to you the means of rec|onciling what you owe to your rank, with what you owe to your neighbour: It will give order to your dome&s;tic affairs, and an air of greatne&s;s to all your actions: So as to enable you to be oeconomical, and yet magnificent on proper occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>ABRIDGE your&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e &s;uper|fluities, which the world e&s;teems fa&s;hionable; To be the &s;lave of vanity and folly, argues a weak and pu&s;illanimous

&s;pirit. A &s;oldier is not allowed to be &s;ubject to tho&s;e trifles, which engro&s;s the attention of a PETIT MAITRE: Nothing is more incompatible with the indulgencies of luxury and pride, than a military life; nor does any thing better &s;upport the dignity of that character, than a noble, unaffected exter|nal appearance. We often have recour&s;e to the world; only becau&s;e we e&s;teem what is fa&s;hionable and &s;pecious, in preference to what is really meritorious and prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>THE different ma&s;ters, who have hitherto had the care of your education, have only taught you to read and &s;peak with propriety: They have in&s;tructed you in the elements of &s;ome of the &s;ciences; and enabled you to appear with an air of ea&s;e and elegance. But MY bu&s;ine&s;s is to furni&s;h your minds with &s;uch &s;entiments, as may render you worthy of the country in which you live; the re&s;t is no more than mere varni&s;h. When your &s;ouis are filled with the love of GOD, your king and your country, and with a true &s;en&s;e of your &s;everal duties; your character will be complete, your conduct will be exemplary: You will then give every man his due, and live in &s;uch a manner as to render virtue re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>THE genero&s;ity which I recommend to you, being that virtue which particularly belongs to people of quality, is not &s;imply confined to lending or giving: It extends it&s;elf much farther, rendering the mind &s;en&s;ible of every thing that is in|tere&s;ting to humanity. What indeed can be more truly great, more worthy of your illu&s;trious birth, than to be touched with the &s;ight of the mi&s;eries of others? You will not only &s;ympathize with tho&s;e who &s;uffer; but you will make every one about you happy. If you have a detach|ment to command, you will render the &s;oldier's duty as ea&s;y to him as you can: You will li&s;ten to his complaints; you

will comfort him in his &s;orrows, you will be his protector and his friend. Your father has often told me, that the great VENDOME could have led his troops even into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; &s;o warmly were they attached to their Gen|eral. They were ready to &s;acrifice them&s;elves for the &s;ake of a commander, who treated them with humanity; and who knew how to be good to his &s;oldiers, without being familiar with them.</P>
<P>OF that multitude of young per&s;ons who are ruined by ex|travagance, none are capable either of friend&s;hip or compa&s;|&s;ion: Their life, which is a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ures, of debts, and embarra&s;&s;ments, puts it out of their power to &s;erve and oblige others. Their vanity and their pa&s;sions de|mand all they have; and be&s;ides what tends to the gratifi|cation of the&s;e, nothing more is to be expected. You will &s;ee the world filled with this &s;ort of people; who, being di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed in the mid&s;t of large NOMINAL e&s;tates, enrich only tho&s;e who plunder them, or who lend them money at an ex|travagant intere&s;t. They in&s;ult the wretched; they de&s;pi&s;e the common people; they make a je&s;t of the public mi&s;ery; and pay attention only to the in&s;truments of their plea&s;ures, and the mini&s;ters of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THESE are the men, with whom you mu&s;t never be con|nected: The company of the wicked is truly pe&s;tilential; we in&s;en&s;ibly grow familiar with their vices, and we &s;oon be|gin to imitate them. Engage virtue to find you true friends, and &s;he will procure them for you. There are yet generous minds to be found, whom the world has not corrupted; and who, knowing how to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the demands of fa&s;hion, and tho&s;e of right rea&s;on, would rather abridge them|&s;elves, than leave the wretched without con&s;olation and relief.

<P>IT only remains, that I recommend it to you not to imi|tate the folly of tho&s;e mi&s;taken devotees, who, to make a greater &s;how with their alms, divide into a great number of &s;mall portions, what is &s;carce &s;ufficient to relieve a twentieth part of tho&s;e among whom it is di&s;tributed. By confining your benefactions within a narrower compa&s;s, you will be enabled to do more real good; you may perhaps &s;ave &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;ed families from ruin: Whereas alms &s;cattered here and there are like medicines which palliate, but never heal.</P>
<P>GIVE the reins to your natural di&s;po&s;ition, which has hitherto appeared excellent; and in the ca&s;e of genero&s;ity I know no better guide. Fear not, that you &s;hall le&s;&s;en your fortune by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the nece&s;&s;itous; we only ruin our&s;elves by being vicious: Virtue keeps every one within proper bounds, who is attentive to her precepts.</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>I</HI> have neglected to do in this re&s;pect, I charge YOU to &s;upply; filial affection engages you to do it: And my love demands it of you in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, as the means of enabling me to live, even after my death. You cannot but &s;ee how nearly it approaches: My eyes are already grown dim; my voice is weakened; and nothing remains to me, but that &s;pirit which a &s;en&s;e of duty in&s;pires. I will keep it alive as much as po&s;&s;ible, even to my late&s;t moment, that I may omit nothing which can po&s;&s;ibly improve your under&s;tanding, or exalt your &s;entiments. As an equal &s;hare of attention is due from me to all my children, I &s;hall di&s;|cour&s;e to-morrow evening with your &s;i&s;ter: She is of an age

<P>I AM obliged to &s;ummon together all the information I have ever received, that I may be the better enabled to fur|ni&s;h you all with the means of conducting your&s;elves aright. My heart is con&s;tantly filled with anxiety on your account; it urges, it conjures me to unfold to you all that it can think of, and all that it de&s;ires to &s;ecure your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT a comfort will it be to me, if death &s;hould leave me time fully to declare my &s;entiments to you all! There is a wonderful difference betwixt the in&s;tructions which we re|ceive from a ma&s;ter, and the advice which is delivered by the mouth of a mother; who&s;e words are, every one of them, expre&s;&s;ive of the tendere&s;t affection. Could you but know what pa&s;&s;es in my mind every time I &s;peak to you! It ap|pears, as if you actually re&s;ided in my heart; and as though my blood, which can hardly any longer circulate through my veins, &s;erved only to be employed for your &s;upport.</P>
<P>NO: Nothing can equal the tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment, which your pre&s;ence excites in my heart: I have told you &s;o a hundred times; and I &s;hall tell you &s;o again and again, even to my la&s;t breath. The more ardent our affection is, the more it delights to repeat its tenderne&s;s and tran&s;ports. Alas! every thing con&s;pires to affect me, whenever I behold you: I &s;ee your father in every line and feature: When you &s;peak, it is his voice I hear. In &s;hort, I &s;ee my own heart repre&s;ented in yours; and this a&s;&s;ures me, that when I &s;hall cea&s;e to live, I &s;hall be renewed in you: Ah!

<HEAD>CONFERENCE X. <HI>On</HI> FEMALE CONDUCT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE long wi&s;hed, my dear Daughter, for this opportu|nity of freely conver&s;ing with you on &s;ubjects of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to you. Your youth, the world into which you are going, the &s;nares which it lays, and the few days which I have yet to live, all induce me to open my heart to you, and to give you &s;ome in&s;tructions relative to your danger|ous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>IF you could po&s;&s;ibly entertain a doubt of my affection, the effort I am now making, when my &s;oul is bowed down with &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow, and &s;ees nothing before it but the horrors of the grave, mu&s;t needs convince you how earne&s;tly I wi&s;h to &s;ecure your happine&s;s. My wi&s;hes will never be re|alined, but while you are careful to lay down proper rules for your conduct, and &s;uffer nothing afterwards to tempt you to break through them.</P>
<P>IF you are &s;o unhappy as to give your&s;elf up to the di&s;trac|tion of the world, you will no longer be able to maintain the dominion over your own heart: You will live an utter &s;tran|ger to your&s;elf; and there will not be a &s;ingle day, which you will know how to di&s;po&s;e of in a proper manner. The world is never to be &s;atisfied; the more we be&s;tow upon it, the more unrea&s;onable are its demands.</P>
<P>YOUR &s;ex requires the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection; what among MEN is reputed a venial fault, is an ab&s;olute crime

with us. There are a thou&s;and things &s;aid and done in their company, which a woman ought neither to hear nor &s;ee. I would wi&s;h that a young woman &s;hould be &s;ilent and mode&s;t; and the world, di&s;&s;ipated as it is, expects the &s;ame. Its judg|ment of us is very &s;evere; and it often fixes our character for life.</P>
<P>IF you are over-&s;olicitous to plea&s;e others, you will run into a ridiculous affectation; You mu&s;t make your&s;elf agreeable to every one you conver&s;e with, without letting them &s;ee that you are thinking about it. Nothing plea&s;es which is not natural. A woman, who &s;ets her&s;elf to draw the attention and admiration of all upon her, will &s;oon become an arrant coquette, if &s;he is not one already.</P>
<P>IT is only a natural and virtuous behaviour, which will &s;ecure to you e&s;teem and approbation: If this &s;hould not &s;uc|ceed, &s;o much the wor&s;e for tho&s;e you meet with. Whatever happens, this truth is indi&s;putable; that one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of the &s;ex is mode&s;ty. And that a young lady can never appear to greater advantage, than when &s;he is utterly dive&s;ted of affectation in her behaviour.</P>
<P>DO not confound the ideas of mode&s;ty and timidity: The one plea&s;es, the other di&s;tre&s;&s;es; we cannot avoid being hurt, when we &s;ee a young per&s;on confu&s;ed and di&s;concerted. There is &s;uch a thing as an ingenuous confidence, which &s;hould make you not unwilling to &s;peak, when the &s;ubject requires it; and to &s;ing or dance, when a proper opportunity pre&s;ents it&s;elf. If you are not vain, you will not be timorous to a fault.</P>
<P>I SHALL be very &s;orry for you, if ever vanity takes po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of your heart; for then, in&s;tead of being agreeable and communicative, you will be always unhappy in your&s;elf, and
<PB N="77" REF="029954_0045_0FE38214BACE8120">
your boldne&s;s will only &s;erve to make you ridiculous to others. A di&s;dainful carriage is that of a per&s;on of mean talents, and a bad heart; people of quality are le&s;s apt to a&s;&s;ume it, than tho&s;e of an inferior rank. We &s;eldom endeavour to &s;et our|&s;elves off by pride, but when we have no other means of di&s;|tingui&s;hing our&s;elves; this is a ridiculous affectation, which the world always laughs at, but never forgives: The more humiliating our behaviour is to others, the more plea&s;ure do they take in letting us down.</P>
<P>AFFABILITY will &s;upply the want of tho&s;e qualities, which you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s: It is the be&s;t apology that I know for little imperfections. Great allowances are always made for one, who has no pride or preten&s;ions to &s;uperior merit: But &s;elf-love naturally rai&s;es in us an oppo&s;ition to arrogance and pre&s;umption. Many women have become the &s;ubjects of &s;atire, only by their haughty behaviour. Your figure is not without its &s;hare of elegance; and the hand&s;omer a lady is, the more ready people are to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he is vain.</P>
<P>THE education I have hitherto given you convinces me, that the toilet will not engage your chief attention; you ought to &s;pend as much time at it, as is nece&s;&s;ary for your de|cent appearance in company. We mu&s;t not fly in the face of fa&s;hion, or make our&s;elves remarkable by our &s;ingularity: But there are certain trifles in dre&s;s, which we ought to de&s;|pi&s;e. Tho&s;e which make a woman a &s;lave to her dre&s;s, are fit only for &s;uch weak minds, as the pre&s;ent age, with all its attachment to trifles, hath not yet learnt to e&s;teem.</P>
<P>LET your hours be properly regulated; and you will find time to wor&s;hip GOD, and to pur&s;ue &s;ome u&s;eful &s;tudy. You will then have no imaginary complaints; and will be an utter &s;tranger to the mi&s;eries attendant upon idlene&s;s: A life well employed, is always an agreeable life.</P>

<P>THE books you read &s;hould be as pure as your heart, and be reduced within a narrow compa&s;s. It is a mi&s;take, to pre|tend that our &s;ex ought to STUDY. We have no offices of tru&s;t to fill, nor any dignities to be inve&s;ted with; and there|fore we have only need to learn what is nece&s;&s;ary to form the mind, and improve the under&s;tanding. Almo&s;t every learned woman &s;hews that the &s;ciences do not belong to us: I have &s;eldom &s;een one of them, that was not vain, deci&s;ive, and af|fected in her manner of thinking, &s;peaking, and acting.</P>
<P>YOUR attention &s;hould be directed to works of ingenuity; and you &s;hould learn the be&s;t methods of regulating a family, whenever you &s;hall be &s;ettled in the world.

<P>REMEMBER, my dear child, that an obliging behaviour is the very life of &s;ociety. There is no one who is not plea&s;ed with a &s;miling countenance; a want of good humour would render you in&s;upportable to your&s;elf and every one about you. A rea&s;onable &s;oul ought always to be under the guidance of rea&s;on; the behaviour of a capricious mi&s;tre&s;s is a great di&s;|couragement to her attendants: If you would &s;ecure their affection, endeavour to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>MY weakne&s;s, which daily increa&s;es, will not allow me to hope that I &s;hall live to &s;ee you &s;ettled in the world: But it is GOD'S will that it &s;hould be &s;o; and to his good Provi|dence I &s;ubmit.

Nothing is &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed, as the confidence of low and venal minds: Be connected only with women of the &s;tricte&s;t virtue; it is our acquaintance, which fixes our reputation.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould have children; do not part with them at that time, when the light of rea&s;on begins to dawn in their minds. Then it is, that the &s;oul is capable of impre&s;&s;ions, which can never afterwards be effaced; then it is, that it mu&s;t be filled with what&s;oever can in&s;pire it with the love of truth. How very imperfectly do they di&s;charge the duty of a mother, who only &s;ee their children, either to admire, or to chide them! Reflect on the conduct of the fowls of the air; always engaged in the care of their young, they never leave them 'till they have taught them to fly. Are we le&s;s wi&s;e than the&s;e irrational creatures? One would think, by the difference in our conduct, that rea&s;on was inferior to in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>WHEN you appear thoroughly impre&s;&s;ed with a love of your duty, you will have fewer admirers of your per&s;on, than of your virtue. There is nothing more di&s;gu&s;ting than the character of a woman, who li&s;tens only to ful&s;ome compli|ments; who only lies in wait for flattery, and who&s;e beha|viour on obtaining it is truly ridiculous. A well di&s;po&s;ed mind treats every one with proper re&s;pect; and never lo&s;es its dignity, even when it is mo&s;t familiar.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="029954_0047_0FE3822021DB01E8">BE always upon your guard again&s;t a profe&s;&s;ed wit: He is a critic, who often does us great mi&s;chief: If he is not &s;a|tirical, he is at lea&s;t very forward, and his repartees are to be dreaded. Mode&s;ty is no objection to any per&s;on: And few have ever yet complained of it. To give your own opinion with diffidence, to hear that of others with attention, and candidly to defend your neighbour's reputation where it may be defended, is a &s;ure way to be loved and e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>ABHOR luxury and idlene&s;s; the&s;e two, which are the &s;ources of many other vices, weaken and de&s;troy the powers of the mind. Study nothing more than a delicacy of &s;enti|ment and behaviour; &s;peak without affectation, and write without di&s;gui&s;e; nothing is &s;o plea&s;ing as the truth. The letters of Madame DE SEVIGNE, which you cannot read too often, have never been without admirers, from their being &s;o exactly conformable to nature; it is a &s;ure &s;ign of our want of wit, when we are always endeavouring to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>SUCH is the advice, my dear daughter, which my own ex|perience and my heart &s;ugge&s;t; a knowledge of the world will &s;upply the re&s;t: This is a &s;cience, which never is for|gotten, and which prevents our being deficient in any nece&s;|&s;ary point of behaviour.</P>
<P>YOU are doubtle&s;s &s;urprized that, in a &s;eries of in&s;truction, which comprehends the whole life, I &s;hould have &s;aid nothing on the &s;ubject of religion. But you will cea&s;e to wonder, when I tell you, that I re&s;erve a &s;ubject, &s;o intere&s;ting to your brothers and your&s;elf, for another conference; when I have an opportunity of &s;peaking to you all together.</P>
<P>YOUR father, whom you &s;carce remember, charged me to be particularly attentive to your education. Though he is no more, he ought to live continually in your heart, by a
<PB N="82" REF="029954_0048_0FE38227EEDB8390">
con&s;tant love of virtue; this is the be&s;t way of recalling him to your mind, and of &s;hewing your re&s;pect for his memory.</P>
<P>THE hour is at hand, when you will be an orphan; but you will be in the hands of GOD; he is more e&s;pecially the protector of the fatherle&s;s. In other re&s;pects, you may de|pend on the goodne&s;s of your uncle, who&s;e &s;entiments I well know. He loves you, and he is a man of the &s;tricte&s;t integrity. He will con&s;ider you as his daughter; and will &s;ettle you in the world, &s;o as to make you happy. With all my heart I wi&s;h you to be &s;o; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to love you more ten|derly than I do. But enough for the pre&s;ent, my dear child; it is time for you to retire; and I am too much agitated by talking thus tenderly with you. Your pre&s;ence excites tho&s;e tears, which my grief will not &s;uffer to break forth:&mdash;I feel my&s;elf almo&s;t &s;uffocated;&mdash;I would wi&s;h to recover my &s;pirits, but I am not able:&mdash;Oh! amiable child!&mdash;Oh! mother, deeply afflicted!</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XI. <HI>On</HI> STUDY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the pre&s;ence of your &s;i&s;ter cau&s;ed in me &s;uch emotions of tenderne&s;s, as almo&s;t entirely overcame me, yet I am not willing any longer to defer my admonitions on the love which you ought to have for STUDY. I perceive that I am ha&s;tening to my end; and I de&s;ire nothing more &s;incerely than that, being reduced to eternal &s;ilence, I may find a place in your remembrance. This is the portion of a being, who has only a borrowed and mo&s;t precarious life.</P>
<P>I SHALL not enter into a detail, which &s;uppo&s;es a knowl|edge of the &s;ciences, and of the learned pvofe&s;&s;ors of them. For be&s;ides that it was always my opinion, that a woman ought not to &s;tudy mathematicks, or philo&s;ophy; that round of di&s;&s;ipation in which I have &s;pent &s;o great a part of my life, has left me little more than common experience, and &s;ome remembrance of what I have heard others mention on this head.</P>
<P>I SHOULD imagine that you can never do better, than devote to literary pur&s;uits the moments which are at your own di&s;|po&s;al: A mind, which we neglect to cultivate, is like a body which we do not feed. By reading, the faculties are enlarged, the memory is &s;trengthened, and the imagination is enriched: But the principal point is, to di&s;tingui&s;h what is worth reading, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many works, as are continually making their appearance in the world; this choice is a matter of real difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="029954_0049_0FE3822CC22BD8E0">MR. &mdash;, to who&s;e merit you are no &s;trangers, and whom I have con&s;ulted upon this &s;ubject, is of opinion, that you &s;hould immediately have recour&s;e to &s;uch writings, as tend to regulate the morals, and to form the mind. He advi&s;es your beginning with books of &s;uch a nature as will furni&s;h you with &s;ound principles on the mo&s;t important obligations of life; &s;uch as will &s;hew you the delu&s;ions of &s;en&s;ual conduct, and the de&s;truction occa&s;ioned by the indulgence of our pa&s;|&s;ions; &s;uch as will elevate your minds, by making you ac|quainted with GOD and with your&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHEN you have fir&s;t taken care to furni&s;h your&s;elves with virtuous &s;entiments; you will diligently con&s;ult &s;uch authors, as have written on the &s;ubject of your profe&s;&s;ion: It being an unpardonable ignorance not to be well acquainted with what|ever is the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives. Your uncle, who has been engaged in military &s;ervice all his life, and who has &s;tudied all the arts and exerci&s;es of war, will be the be&s;t director in this re&s;pect; and will furni&s;h you with the propere&s;t books on the &s;ubject: Apply your&s;elves diligently to this &s;tudy, and you will &s;oon reap the fruits of it. A &s;oldier, who goes on only in the beaten track, without making him&s;elf thoroughly ac|quainted with the nature of his bu&s;ine&s;s, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little better than a piece of clock-work; which mu&s;t be &s;et in motion, and never deviates from the path a&s;&s;igned it.</P>
<P>AFTER this, you will learn to know the world; BRUYERE'S characters, and ROCHEFOUCAULT'S max|ims, will be found u&s;eful to you; in the&s;e writers you will &s;ee the portraits of all &s;orts of men, both in their public and private capacity.</P>
<P>HISTORY is another picture, which you &s;hould carefully examine: All the operations of the heart and mind are there
<PB N="86" REF="029954_0050_0FE38237423746A8">
de&s;cribed in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting manner. BOSSUET'S trea|ti&s;e on this &s;ubject is con&s;idered as a ma&s;ter-piece.</P>
<P>BOOKS of mere amu&s;ement, which do not take their place 'till after tho&s;e of in&s;truction, are however nece&s;&s;ary, by way of relaxation, to prevent fatigue. I know no romance worth reading, except Don Quixotte, and Telemachus; almo&s;t all the re&s;t are either trifling, or mi&s;chievous: Fiction is &s;eldom made u&s;e of with &s;afety; it either &s;erves to embelli&s;h vice, or to ridicule virtue.</P>
<P>IT is very right, that you &s;hould read the be&s;t poets: Poetry elevates the mind, warms the imagination, and makes us per|fect in the art of expre&s;&s;ion; but care mu&s;t be taken to &s;tudy the poets with di&s;cretion. Pro&s;e, being le&s;s likely to &s;educe the mind, is more proper for young per&s;ons who &s;uffer them|&s;elves too ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed upon: We can never be too much on our guard again&s;t the glaring appearance of what is fal&s;ely accounted beautiful. I have known many people, who&s;e ta&s;te has been &s;poiled by reading poetry only: The rhyme &s;educes, harmony of numbers bewitches; and what is often only fiction, pa&s;&s;es for truth.</P>
<P>NEVER purcha&s;e books, without con&s;ulting learned and judicious friends; and remember that it is not the number, but the choice of books which really adorns and improves the mind. The library of a military man is large enough, if it contains two or three hundred volumes; they who have more, either keep them for the u&s;e of others, or to flatter their own vanity. How many noblemen are there, who make no more u&s;e of their library, than of their green-hou&s;e, &s;eldom, if ever, entering into either!</P>
<P>I HAVE heard it affirmed by a celebrated writer, that almo&s;t all modern works are only copies; and that we ought only to
<PB N="87" REF="029954_0050_0FE38237423746A8">
&s;tudy &s;uch, as are originals. I am &s;orry this author is now no more; becau&s;e he would have given you the be&s;t informa|tion on this head; but you will ea&s;ily meet with other learned per&s;ons, who will readily direct your &s;tudies. If you pur&s;ue the plan here propo&s;ed, you will divide into four cla&s;&s;es all the books which you have any need of: The fir&s;t, will in|clude books on the &s;ubject of religion; the &s;econd, books of in&s;truction in your profe&s;&s;ion; the third, tho&s;e which are proper to introduce you to natural and moral philo&s;ophy; and the fourth, books of mere amu&s;ement. We &s;eldom read to advantage, but when we read methodically.</P>
<P>THERE are other works, which we may run through; &s;uch as, the daily, and periodical publications; which may &s;erve to give you a &s;uperficial knowledge of what is pa&s;&s;ing in the literary world; and will prevent your being a &s;tranger to what is talked of in company on the&s;e &s;ubjects. But always &s;hew wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion enough, not to confound this kind of writing with tho&s;e numerous publications which good &s;en&s;e and religion equally di&s;claim.</P>
<P>IMPROPER reading is the ruin of young minds; forbidden books ought to be con&s;idered in the light of evil company. Neither the &s;tyle of a work, nor the name of an author, can excu&s;e your reading either what is &s;atirical or impure: Vice is always vice, under whatever colours it pre&s;ents it&s;elf. There are theatrical performances, &s;o decent that we may venture to go through them, and &s;o intere&s;ting that we cannot help wi&s;hing to do it. Be prudent without affectation, and you will never have any vain &s;cruples.</P>
<P>THE books, which you have hitherto read, are little more than the elements, and as it were the alphabets of &s;cience; tho&s;e which you &s;hould hereafter read, ought to contain the knowledge of things, and &s;ound rea&s;oning upon them. There
<PB N="88" REF="029954_0051_0FE38316B0475830">
are different kinds of &s;tudy appropriated to all ages and &s;tations. The mind of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic demands a very differ|ent &s;ort of cultivation from that of a man of the world.</P>
<P>THE generality of marked are &s;atisfied with being able to write and to &s;peak well; but this is not &s;ufficient for per|&s;ons in your &s;ituation. Your country requires that as &s;oldiers you &s;hould be well in&s;tructed, &s;o as to be able to give a &s;ati&s;|factory rea&s;on for whatever you do: You will moreover find in &s;tudy the happy &s;ecret of not being burthen&s;ome to any one; and will have a perpetual &s;ource of entertainment in your&s;elves.</P>
<P>WELL cho&s;en books are our be&s;t friends; we find them always ready when we want them: And, when judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, they always &s;peak the truth to us. It is a great hap|pine&s;s to be able &s;ometimes to endure &s;olitude: We mu&s;t learn how to withd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw our&s;elves from the conver&s;e of men, as well as how to bear with it. We mu&s;t lay in a &s;tore of know|ledge again&s;t approaching old age: By reading, we enlarge the &s;phere of our under&s;tanding; and we afterwards feel much greater plea&s;ure in the mid&s;t of &s;ociety. All the&s;e ad|vantages will attend you, if you love &s;tudy, and cultivate your intellectual faculties.</P>
<P>YOUR father&mdash;alas! I would to GOD, he were now &s;upply|ing my place on this important &s;ubject! Your father has often told me, that in great towns a love of &s;tudy pre&s;erved him from a thou&s;and dangers, and that in little villages it &s;erved him in&s;tead of company. Be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this re&s;ource; for knowledge is a trea&s;ure which no thief can &s;teal: Yet do not &s;eek this trea&s;ure at the expen&s;e of your health. Im|moderate application to &s;tudy exhau&s;ts the &s;pirits, and fatigues the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="029954_0051_0FE38316B0475830">TAKE heed al&s;o, that learning do not make you po&s;itive or pedantic; the more men really know, the le&s;s they affect to &s;hew it. We make every man our enemy, whom we humiliate by an affected &s;uperiority: But he, who regards his own intere&s;t, &s;eeks to make him&s;elf friends. If it be true that ignorance is de&s;pi&s;ed, it is not le&s;s true that pre|&s;umptuous knowledge is generally hated: An o&s;tentatious di&s;play of learning never &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not expect to find &s;tudy always agreeable: Like the ro&s;e, it has its beauties, but is not without its thorns. The beginning of every &s;cience, as M. de Fontenelle ob&s;erves, is difficult; and nothing but a&s;&s;iduity and labour will enable you to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of it. I &s;hould recommend it to you to devote three hours, at lea&s;t, in every day, to &s;tudy: Two in the morning, and one in the evening. You are never to forget that you owe &s;omething to your rank in life, as well as to &s;ociety; and that it is with the &s;oul, as it is with the body: Exce&s;&s;ive hunger and repletion are both injurious to it; by the one it is fami&s;hed, by the other it is overloaded.</P>
<P>THERE is another inconvenience in an indi&s;creet love of &s;tudy; that it makes us too cold, and philo&s;ophical; it makes men behave in company with an air of too much gravity, and ab&s;ence; and gives them the appearance of old men at the age of thirty. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to leave your books, as we leave the company of our friends; &s;eem to forget them, 'till you take them up again. The world, perhaps, is very little intere&s;ted in what you read; &s;o that probably what nearly affected YOU, might to THEM be perfectly indifferent; every one has his own particular manner of con&s;idering things. Our conver&s;ation with the dead, demands recollec|tion, and application;, but that which we hold with the living &s;hould be full of ea&s;e, and &s;prightline&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029954_0052_0FE38243A8A6A1A8">IF you are really fond of &s;tudy, you will every where find an opportunity of gratifying your ta&s;te: The very gra&s;s on which you tread, and the in&s;ect which you de&s;pi&s;e, will &s;erve to di&s;play the wonders of divine wi&s;dom. Accu&s;tom your&s;elf always to travel with a common-place-book; a land&s;cape, a monument, a ruin, every thing of this &s;ort, finds a place in the journal of a per&s;on of reflection.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of cu&s;toms and manners is another &s;cience, which de&s;erves your attention. You will doubtle&s;s have op|portunities, in the cour&s;e of your profe&s;&s;ion, of &s;eeing the different nations which &s;urround us: War lays open every country to the ob&s;ervation of the &s;oldier. You will then be able your&s;elves to mark the difference betwixt a Spaniard and a Frenchman, an Italian and an Engli&s;hman. But re|member at the &s;ame time, that in this variety there is &s;ome|thing not unlike the parterres of a garden; in which each flower has its merit and perfection: It is a great error, to expect that all the world &s;hould be ju&s;t &s;uch as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing more to &s;ay on this &s;ubject: My knowl|edge of it is very confined, and my &s;trength too much ex|hau&s;ted to be able to prolong this conference. You live in an age in which you will not want for directors, if you know how to choo&s;e them: As for me, my chief &s;tudy at pre&s;ent, is the contemplation of death. I perceive nothing but &s;hades of darkne&s;s, which &s;urround me on every &s;ide. My tender regard for you indeed &s;erves from time to time to di&s;per&s;e them, and opens to my view a gleam of light, by the help of which I behold you, as the delight of my &s;oul, and the very joy of my heart. Nothing moves me, where you are not concerned; but I am immediately rouzed, when your welfare is in que&s;tion, and I at once forget all my pains and all my infirmities.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029954_0052_0FE38243A8A6A1A8">IF my attachment is too &s;trong, GOD, I hope, will pardon it; for he &s;ees the very bottom of my heart, that it has at pre&s;ent only one de&s;ire, viz. that you may be truly virtuous. I will not &s;ay, I would &s;acrifice my life, to obtain this ble&s;&s;ing; for alas! what would that be worth, at the hands of one, who has only a few wretched hours, or perhaps minutes, to live? But this is mo&s;t certain, that I never yet de&s;ired any thing more earne&s;tly, than I now wi&s;h for your happine&s;s, both in this world and the next.</P>
<P>I HUMBLY hope, that GOD will open the kingdom of heaven to receive me; and I tru&s;t, I &s;hall hereafter &s;ee you with me there. The &s;hort enjoyment I have had of you upon earth, is not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy my affection for you; I per|ceive it yet too much alive to die with me.</P>
<P>ALAS! how much do we &s;uffer, when the heart is &s;o full of &s;en&s;ibility as mine is! But I mu&s;t even dive&s;t my&s;elf of nature, if I would get rid of my &s;entiments of love and ten|derne&s;s for my children.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XII. <HI>On the</HI> CLERICAL CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;order of this excellent lady increa&s;ing, they de|&s;paired of her being any more able to di&s;cour&s;e with her family: But it plea&s;ed GOD, that the &s;ymptoms abated, and her &s;trength returned for a little while. Ever filled with the tendere&s;t concern for her children, &s;he embraced this opppor|tunity of calling her &s;on, the ABBE, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="029954_0053_0FE3824A95D2BB20">YOU, my &s;on, have made choice of a &s;tate of life very dif|ferent from that of your brothers; the advice therefore, which I would wi&s;h to give you, ought to be per&s;onally di|rected to your&s;elf. My great comfort, with re&s;pect to the profe&s;&s;ion you have engaged in, is, that I have not over-ruled your choice; this encourages me to hope, that GOD will ble&s;s you in it. You have more need, than any other, of the gifts of heaven; becau&s;e you have more duties to di&s;charge: No in&s;tance of mi&s;conduct in an eccle&s;ia&s;tic is trifling or in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>I AM but little acquainted with divinity, or with the books which you ought to &s;tudy: But I know that your life ought to be a life of application; and that if idlene&s;s is a fault in us, in one of your profe&s;&s;ion, it is a crime.</P>
<P>I KNOW al&s;o that the books, which &s;hould engage your principal attention, are not merely books of amu&s;ement; but tho&s;e which treat of chri&s;tian perfection, and the means which lead us to it. For how will you be able to direct others, if you have not your&s;elf learnt the way?</P>
<P>BE careful not to be occupied too much with &s;ecular af|fairs: Tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who have been &s;o engaged, have never yet found it the way to procure e&s;teem. They are in|deed &s;ought after, and con&s;ulted; but they are not really re&s;|pected: We think, with rea&s;on, that their function &s;hould be &s;acred.</P>
<P>EXTERNALLY to renounce the world, and afterwards eagerly to pur&s;ue the concerns of it, is to a&s;&s;ume a character truly ridiculous: The life of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, immer&s;ed in worldly concerns, is incon&s;i&s;tency it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I SAY nothing to you of your morals. The mo&s;t un&s;ullied virtue is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to your profe&s;&s;ion, that he who is de&s;ti|tute
<PB N="93" REF="029954_0053_0FE3824A95D2BB20">
of it, is an object of dete&s;tation in the &s;ight of GOD and man: In &s;pite of the corruption of the age, a vicious prie&s;t is in&s;upportable. Even the libertine is &s;hocked, when he hears of the mi&s;conduct of a per&s;on, inve&s;ted with your &s;acred character: All men expect, that they, who are required to &s;et an example to others, &s;hould them&s;elves be really exem|plary.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more offen&s;ive, than the &s;ight of a clerical PETIT-MAITRE, who&s;e whole life is &s;pent in ridiculous trifles? There is a certain decorum, which you cannot too &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erve. I never &s;aw an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who af|fected to be a man of the world, that did not make him&s;elf contemptible: The company generally amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;uch an one, as a bauble or a toy.</P>
<P>IF you would wi&s;h to be re&s;pected, your outward appear|ance mu&s;t not contradict the nature of your profe&s;&s;ion. Let all your purpo&s;es be honourable and prudent, and all your words be the interpreters of your mind: It is a certain in|dication of a depravity of heart, when we are not circum&s;pect in our conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>SHUN hypocri&s;y, and affected &s;ingularity; your &s;ituation is too con&s;iderable to have a part to act. Appear to be &s;uch as you really are, and every one will re&s;pect you; affected manners &s;uppo&s;e weakne&s;s or duplicity.</P>
<P>AS for public diver&s;ions, con&s;ider them as prohibited to per&s;ons of your profe&s;&s;ion: An eccle&s;ia&s;tic is to be pitied, who cannot find &s;ufficient employment and &s;atisfaction in the duties of his function. I do not mean to exclude innocent dome&s;tic amu&s;ements among your friends, but an immoderate attendance on places of public re&s;ort. And above all things, what is called PLAY in public, I look upon as criminal in a
<PB N="94" REF="029954_0054_0FE3825519BFEB40">
clergyman: One half of the company ridicules, while the other is offended at &s;uch behaviour; and all agree, that it tends to the injury and di&s;credit of religion.</P>
<P>IN your apparel, be neither carele&s;s nor finical: A graceful &s;implicity &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h a per&s;on, who&s;e duty it is to re|commend moderation to others. He, who endeavours to &s;et him&s;elf off by an undue conformity to the world in his dre&s;s or manners, appears to be a&s;hamed of his profe&s;&s;ion: He is a kind of amphibious creature, who being neither fit for the church, nor for the world, has &s;omething mon&s;trous in his appearance. We are not fond of incon&s;i&s;tencies, either in men's outward behaviour, or in their minds: He, who is not con&s;i&s;tent in his conduct, is like an actor on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>THE fa&s;hions of the world are not de&s;igned to be adopted by prie&s;ts or magi&s;trates: The gravity of their character mu&s;t be &s;hewn in their manners, and in their dre&s;s. Imper|tinence is de&s;picable in any one; in per&s;ons con&s;ecrated to the prie&s;thood it is odious. What mu&s;t one think of a clergyman running from morning to night, from one &s;cene of plea&s;ure to another? The world laughs at him, religion weeps for him.</P>
<P>I NEED not &s;ay, that you cannot be too circum&s;pect in every thing which concerns the ordinances of religion; one doctrine of which, you well know, cannot be attacked, with|out materially injuring the whole. A prie&s;t, who &s;hould him|&s;elf be wretch enough to treat them with contempt, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as one who holds him&s;elf up to ridicule and ju&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>CONSIDER it as your duty, to frequent the &s;ociety of the mo&s;t learned and virtuous men: Their conver&s;ation reflects light upon us; and we in&s;en&s;ibly copy after their manners. Be cautious in your behaviour to the female &s;ex, avoiding all

offen&s;ive levity: It fares with the reputation of an eccle|&s;ia&s;tic, as with a mirrour; the &s;malle&s;t blemi&s;h de&s;troys its beauty.</P>
<P>LET your library con&s;i&s;t of the mo&s;t celebrated books, and delight in reading them: An ignorant clergyman is a man, who makes &s;port for the public; one who di&s;honours religion, aed whom all men de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>RATHER be afraid, than ambitious, of heaping up bene|fices and dignities; at lea&s;t never try to obtain them by ad|ulation or intrigue. He, who purcha&s;es by mean compliances the highe&s;t preferments in the church, lo&s;es oftentimes his honour, if not his &s;oul. Merit alone ought to recommend an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who knows what his profe&s;&s;ion demands of him, and is di&s;po&s;ed to conform him&s;elf to the duties of it.</P>
<P>BE always ready to open your heart and your pur&s;e to the truly wretched: And e&s;pecially, if you are largely provided for, con&s;ider your riches as intended principally for their benefit. There is nothing &s;o oppo&s;ite to the tenor of the go&s;pel, as a covetous or ambitious prie&s;t. Your own patri|mony will be &s;ufficient for you, if you are not addicted to luxury and exce&s;s; it is this, which almo&s;t always reduces men to poverty.</P>
<P>AIM at &s;implicity in your furniture, and in every thing that is external: Let your virtues be your principal orna|ment, and be indifferent about the re&s;t.</P>
<P>LET not pride ever take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your heart; it is the characteri&s;tic of a weak mind, and the &s;ure&s;t way to become hateful to others. There is no one, who is not charmed with conde&s;cen&s;ion and &s;weetne&s;s of behaviour: But if this were not the ca&s;e, how is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile a haughty di&s;|po&s;ition with the precepts of the go&s;pel?</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="029954_0055_0FE38259C487A718">SUCH, my dear &s;on, are the in&s;tructions, which I thought it my duty to give YOU; every one of them is dictated by love, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire of promoting your happine&s;s.

<P>YOU mu&s;t remember, that the conduct of your brothers ought not to be a matter of indifference to you; your pro|fe&s;&s;ion engages you to point out to them their duty, and to remon&s;trate, if you find them negligent of it.

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XIII. <HI>On</HI> PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>PRIDE, my dear children, being frequently connected with an exalted &s;ituation in life, I think it my duty to &s;et before you the folly and danger of it. Be a&s;&s;ured it is this, which hath carried every &s;pecies of luxury to its pre&s;ent height; and hath made that the idol of almo&s;t every rank. We impoveri&s;h our&s;elves, merely for the &s;ake of outward &s;hew; and every po&s;&s;ible &s;hift is made to CUT A FIGURE in the world.</P>
<P>WE are anxious to conceal our common original; and that common de&s;tiny, which puts us all upon a level. We endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;uade our&s;elves, that a rich man is quite a different creature from the re&s;t of mankind; and that there is no &s;uch thing as real greatne&s;s in the world, in&s;eparable from riches and honours.</P>
<P>THE effect of &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion is, that virtue has no charms to engage our affections; it is a &s;hade which we avoid, that we may ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of fortune, whom with idolatrous veneration we adore.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een the luxury and pride, which abound at this time in our cities, begin and increa&s;e in &s;uch a manner, as to ruin the mo&s;t opulent families: We have &s;een that &s;implicity exploded, which di&s;tingui&s;hed our ance&s;tors, and rendered their manners &s;o amiable and re&s;pectable. Their de&s;cendants very &s;oon began to be a&s;hamed of THEIR plain attire, their
<PB N="98" REF="029954_0056_0FE3826036030AA8">
humble accommodations, their venerable portraits; nothing was any where to be &s;een but a profu&s;ion of expen&s;e, in build|ing magnificent hou&s;es, in purcha&s;ing the riche&s;t dre&s;&s;es, and having the mo&s;t co&s;tly furniture.</P>
<P>WHAT extravagance do you not &s;ee, in this re&s;pect? I am &s;ure it often a&s;toni&s;hes you; and you are thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the folly of it; and cannot but perceive, how greatly our morals &s;uffer by it, and how bitterly virtue laments the effects of it.</P>
<P>WHEN we grow familiar with vanity, and make it the object of our love and pur&s;uit; the &s;oul is regarded as a thing of nought, and the body is in a manner idolized: We tor|ment and even ruin our&s;elves, only for the &s;ake of this; and think of nothing but dazzling our eyes with ornaments, grati|fying our ears with concerts, and our ta&s;te with all kinds of meat, however luxurious and expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>IT is pride, which produces effeminacy, and which prevents our ever moving but in equipages, even &s;leeping but on beds of down: It is continually inventing new plea&s;ures; it ener|vates the mind; and renders even the &s;toute&s;t men, little &s;u|perior to women, both in their dre&s;s, and in their general turn of life.</P>
<P>O! MY children, place this picture often before your eyes; and let it prevent your giving your&s;elves up to pernicious luxury: My former propen&s;ity to this fooli&s;h vanity is the cau&s;e why I am not better able to &s;peak to you on the &s;ubject; but it has al&s;o enabled me thoroughly to di&s;cover its emptine&s;s and folly. My own reflections convince me, that we forget we are rational or even human creatures; and fancy that our wealth is only given us to procure whatever tends to the gratification of our pa&s;&s;ions. Luxury is an aby&s;s, which
<PB N="99" REF="029954_0056_0FE3826036030AA8">
&s;wallows up the greate&s;t e&s;tates, and which we &s;eldom are able to fathom: The fa&s;hions which it &s;tudies, and the trifles which engage its attention, are &s;o many occa&s;ions of our ruin.</P>
<P>BE truly great, and you will never be vain; you will know, that there is a certain propriety to be found between the two extremes of avarice and prodigality; and it it this, which ought to regulate your table, your dre&s;s, and your equipage. You will know, that pride, in making us vain, renders us ridiculous; and that when this prevails, we &s;ee young men effeminately devoting them&s;elves to the toilet, and pa&s;&s;ing half their time under the hands of the hair-dre&s;&s;er. You will find them as &s;eriou&s;ly engaged in determining the colour of their clothes, the &s;ize and &s;hape of the &s;hoe-buckle, and other &s;uch trifles, as if they were matters of the mo&s;t &s;erious importance.</P>
<P>IF you give your&s;elves up to pride, you will be &s;laves to the&s;e idle vanities; and you will thereby weaken the force of that manly virtue, which you naturally inherit from your worthy father.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, you will have every kind of whim and caprice to gratify; you will find numbers ready to &s;upply your demands, by advancing you &s;ums of money, You will be told, that to be in debt is no reflection upon the character of a man of quality; and you will be encouraged to multiply debts, and to ruin your fortune. Every day furni&s;hes us with examples, which confirm this truth. How many per&s;ons of immen&s;e e&s;tates outlive their income; and find them&s;elves &s;urrounded by dome&s;tics, whom they cannot pay; by creditors, who are frequently worrying them: Filled with remor&s;e, which perpetually torments them; and reduced at length to a &s;tate of extreme indigence and nece&s;&s;ity!</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="029954_0057_0FE382655F990510">SUCH are the effects of pride: It carries us headlong into every kind of extravagance; and pre&s;ents to our view a hou&s;e, the furniture of which is not yet paid for, the dome&s;tics full of di&s;content, and the ma&s;ter of the family him&s;elf at his wit's end, being no longer able to find creditors to tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>THESE, my dear children, the&s;e are the mi&s;eries which you mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer, if you give way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pride. But even &s;uppo&s;ing it did not carry you to this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, I need not &s;ay more to di&s;&s;uade you from it, than that it will tend to rob you of your virtue; make you regardle&s;s of the mi&s;eries of your neighbour, and fond of all tho&s;e effeminate indulgencies, and that ridiculous parade, which the world encourages, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately admires.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not do ju&s;tice to your father, if I did not ob&s;erve to you, that he was generous and even magnificent according to his circum&s;tances; yet a noble &s;implicity, and a prudent oeconomy peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed his character. His uncor|rupted manners rejected all tho&s;e expen&s;ive trifles, which an unrea&s;onable fondne&s;s for luxury has rendered fa&s;hionable. The love of his country &s;o engro&s;&s;ed his affections, as to leave no room for vanity in his heart.</P>
<P>EVERY wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;on con&s;iders luxury as the &s;ource of all kinds of iniquity: He knows it is in the &s;chool of pride that we learn to de&s;pi&s;e the poor, to harden our hearts, and to &s;eek after every refinement of plea&s;ure. We cannot bear the &s;ight of an object that is di&s;agreeable to behold, we cannot breathe but among perfumes; we cannot exi&s;t, but in the mid&s;t of &s;oftne&s;s and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT is a great misfortune not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the &s;uperfluities and the nece&s;&s;aries of life; our pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o many tyrants, who allow us no re&s;t 'till we have found the
<PB N="101" REF="029954_0057_0FE382655F990510">
means of &s;atisfying their demands. Hence we &s;ee, that tho&s;e among the great, who li&s;ten to the dictates of pride, are really in a &s;tate of &s;lavery: They are ab&s;olutely dependent on fa&s;h|ion, in the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tance of their lives. If any article is defective in the mid&s;t of all their &s;plendor, they are di&s;tracted, they lo&s;e all patience; they appear to be &s;o entirely taken up with external ornaments, with finery and parade, that they &s;eem to live for no other purpo&s;e, than to gratify a re&s;tle&s;s appetite for trifles.</P>
<P>WHEN we vi&s;it per&s;ons of this turn of mind, we do them THE HONOUR to be utterly regardle&s;s of them&s;elves, that we may give our whole attention to their furniture. We &s;peak to them only of what is every where around them; we attend only to that which dazzles our eyes: As if we meant to give them to under&s;tand, that if they had nothing to exhibit, more worthy of our notice than them&s;elves, they might be content|ed to live in perpetual &s;olitude.</P>
<P>SURELY, my dear children, there is nothing very captivat|ing in &s;uch empty characters as the&s;e; yet &s;uch is the glory of tho&s;e who live in &s;ubjection to luxury and pride, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they are not regarded on their own account, but merely for the &s;ake of their table, and their &s;hew. As a proof of which, if they lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e their riches, they in&s;tantly &s;ink into contempt; it is hard|ly remembered that &s;uch per&s;ons ever exi&s;ted. How different is the &s;tate of tho&s;e, who are really virtuous! Whatever mi&s;|fortunes befall them, they &s;eldom want a panegyri&s;t or admir|er, but are gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rally regarded and e&s;teemed. Hi&s;tory furni&s;h|es us with a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;and in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who&s;e merit, with|out any other &s;upport, has been re&s;pected even in the lowe&s;t ob&s;curity: Such is the power and influence of truth!</P>
<P>WHICH of you then, my dear children, would not rather embrace a virtuous poverty, than be &s;atiated with luxuries,
<PB N="102" REF="029954_0058_0FE3826D9D44DBE0">
and be de&s;titute of virtue? I am per&s;uaded, that neither of you would he&s;itate a moment, in the determination of your choice.</P>
<P>IF my health would &s;uffer me to enter more particularly on the &s;ubject, I could &s;hew you other evil effects of pride; and particularly, that it attracts to it&s;elf per&s;ons of the mo&s;t tri|fling and in&s;ignificant character. Look at the hou&s;e of &s;uch an one as I have been de&s;cribing; and you will find it filled with tho&s;e pretty gentlemen, who&s;e whole life is &s;pent in ruin|ing their fortune and their con&s;titution. You will find it to be the rendezvous of game&s;ters; (for gaming is an in&s;eparable appendage to per&s;ons of that turn of mind, which I have been de&s;cribing:) In &s;hort, luxury has there di&s;played her utmo&s;t charms, to ruin tho&s;e very people, who are &s;tudious to &s;upport her empire in the world.</P>
<P>AN elegant &s;implicity will deliver you from the &s;ociety of men of &s;uch licentious conduct, among whom virtue almo&s;t always &s;uffers &s;hip-wreck. Where pride prevails, religion is de&s;pi&s;ed; an immortal &s;pirit cannot accommodate her&s;elf to tho&s;e peri&s;hable objects, which tend only to chain her down to the earth.</P>
<P>DO not imagine, that luxury is in&s;tantaneous in its growth: It has its beginning, and its progre&s;s: At fir&s;t, it is no more than a de&s;ire of having our hou&s;es more elegantly furni&s;hed, or our per&s;ons more fa&s;hionably dre&s;t, than others of our rank. The love of fa&s;hion in&s;en&s;ibly gets the a&s;cendency over us; 'till we think nothing agreeable, in which there is not an air of elegance and novelty. Scarce is this fir&s;t &s;tep taken, but &s;implicity becomes in&s;upportable: We de&s;pi&s;e a man, whom we &s;ee indifferently clothed; and we annex the idea of &s;upreme felicity to idle and fanta&s;tic plea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="029954_0058_0FE3826D9D44DBE0">WE cannot but hold pride in the lowe&s;t contempt; when we reflect, that every one of this di&s;po&s;ition enjoys the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, without contributing any thing towards its advan|tage&mdash;he deprives the community of many u&s;eful members&mdash; does not properly di&s;charge any duty whatever&mdash;and dies, with|out leaving any memorial, except of the riches which he has wantonly con&s;umed.</P>
<P>LUXURY engages all the world in her &s;ervice: You would think there would be no artificers or manufacturers without her; and that the arts, the elements, and the &s;ea&s;ons, mu&s;t become tributary to her. This it is, which overwhelms the luxurious man with pride; and makes him believe, that he is lord of the creation.</P>
<P>I EARNESTLY hope, the&s;e con&s;iderations will make a due impre&s;&s;ion on your minds. Look on her without prejudice, and you will &s;ee that the pride which is &s;o idolized, is more tran&s;ient, than the cloud which pa&s;&s;eth away; you will &s;ee, that there is nothing good to be expected from a man en|&s;laved to vanity, and &s;unk into effeminacy.</P>
<P>THAT &s;warm of PETITS MAITRES, whom every man of &s;en&s;e de&s;pi&s;es, owes its origin only to pride; which fills them with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove of them&s;elves: And thenceforth a new race of bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> makes its appearance on the &s;tage, expo&s;ing their van|ity to all around them; and burthening &s;ociety with all the charges of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT there is another dreadful effect of pride; which is, that it gives birth to tho&s;e idle and mi&s;chievous books, which are continually publi&s;hing to the world: And which, how|ever harmle&s;s they may be thought, tend to vitiate the ta&s;te, and corrupt the morals. How many young people have been utterly ruined by improper books! If idlene&s;s and the love of plea&s;ure had not taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts, they
<PB N="104" REF="029954_0059_0FE38274ACEB8AD0">
would never have quitted that happy &s;implicity of manners, which in&s;pires us with a love of truth, and teaches us to &s;hun evil and pur&s;ue good.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another thing which I wi&s;h you to ob&s;erve; namely, that you will in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;e your &s;trength of mind, whenever you give your&s;elves up to the influence of pride: And what a ridiculous character is a &s;oldier, di&s;&s;olved in luxury, and totally enervated? There remains nothing more of him than the &s;hadow of a body, and an effeminate mind, to which the &s;lighte&s;t hard&s;hip is a mo&s;t in&s;upportable evil. Accu&s;tomed to &s;leep under a richly-decorated pavilion, to feed on the mo&s;t delicate food, to be attended by a number of &s;ervants, he is either di&s;qualified for the nece&s;&s;ary duties of a &s;oldier; or he carries to the camp a train of luxuries, which are ruinous to him&s;elf, and render him a bad example to others.</P>
<P>SURELY, my dear children, you would not wi&s;h to be &s;oldiers, merely to live in ea&s;e and &s;plendor: Were this the ca&s;e, you would be loaded with reproaches; and your pride, far from procuring you re&s;pect, would only bring you into contempt. A PETIT MAITRE is entirely out of his place, when he is called into the field of battle: His whims, his particularities, his delicacy, all &s;erve to render him unhappy in him&s;elf, and ridiculous to others. He is pointed at as one, who rather acts a part, than is really &s;uch as he ought to be.</P>
<P>YOUR good Father has told me a thou&s;and times, that tho&s;e fine gentlemen who are taken up in admiring them&s;elves, running continually from one circle to another, and ab&s;olutely devoted to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the dre&s;&s;ing-room, were always con&s;idered as officers of no con&s;equence or authority, whom the meane&s;t &s;oldier held in contempt. They can dance in|deed, and they can &s;ing; but they cannot fight; both becau&s;e the art of war demands &s;omething more than mere per&s;onal
<PB N="105" REF="029954_0059_0FE38274ACEB8AD0">
courage, and becau&s;e courage it&s;elf is weakened by the love of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>LOOK at the portraits of your ance&s;tors; take notice of their &s;uits of armour. Think ye, that the delicacy of the pre&s;ent age would have had any charms for them; and that they would have admired an officer &s;cented with perfumes! Alas! How ingenious are we, only to make our&s;elves de&s;|pi&s;ed!</P>
<P>LEAVE pride to tho&s;e who being &s;uddenly grown rich, and &s;truck with &s;eeing them&s;elves become men of con&s;equence, and encircled with flatterers, place all their merit in gilded furniture, and &s;plendid equipages. Neither a virtuous man, nor a man of quality, has any need of luxury to &s;ee him off. It is a great reflection on the pre&s;ent age to &s;uppo&s;e, that it only e&s;teems men according to outward &s;hew: Whereas he alone is worthy of re&s;pect, who&s;e character is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a noble &s;implicity.</P>
<P>BESIDES, how many real inconveniencies do we &s;uffer from this expen&s;ive turn of mind? Every part of our life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avours of an uniform profu&s;ion: We are &s;ubject to a thou|&s;and forms and ceremonies; we are forced to pa&s;s our whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in acting a part; we are &s;urrounded by fal&s;e friends, in&s;olent &s;ervants, and almo&s;t always with anxiety, with debts and di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is very &s;eldom that a man, given up to pride and luxury, knows what &s;obriety is. Phy&s;icians have ob&s;erved, that all, who live to the full, are &s;ubject to indige&s;tions and apoplexies; and that it is this abundance, which generally &s;hortens their lives. We no longer regard our conduct, than while we live in a &s;tate of &s;obriety: As for plea&s;ures, they are the chief executioners of the human race.</P>

I perceive the advances which it makes; yet I find, at pre&s;ent, no re&s;ources in my own &s;trength to fortify me again&s;t that affecting moment.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps&mdash;alas! I only deceive my&s;elf; I feel noth|ing but death approaching.</P>
<P>THE phy&s;ician coming in, the children withdrew; and gave way to tho&s;e effu&s;ions of grief, which the pre&s;ence of their mother had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE lady, having been at church in the morning, returned about eleven o'clock; and having &s;ummoned her children, &s;he &s;aid, I am ju&s;t come from vi&s;iting my burial place, and from looking with my dying eyes on the &s;epulchre of your father. O! what pain has it given me to go through this &s;olemn ceremony! But I was willing to humble that pride, which conceals from us what we are; and which would prove your ruin, &s;hould you not be careful to guard again&s;t its illu&s;ions. When we are brought up in the mid&s;t of human grandeur, it is very difficult to per&s;uade our&s;elves, that we are like other men, and that the brightne&s;s which &s;urrounds
<PB N="107" REF="029954_0060_0FE3827E032C5120">
us will &s;oon be di&s;per&s;ed like a vapour. In the mean time what have we, whereof we can ju&s;tly glory? Alas! though you were nobly born, you came into the world weeping, help|le&s;s, and naked; and you mu&s;t go out of it not le&s;s de&s;titute of riches and honours. In vain will the world then offer you whatever is magnificent, and flattering to our vanity: All this will pa&s;s away like a dream; and the grave will &s;wallow up all your riches, and pride, and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN my vi&s;it to your father's tomb, I &s;aw nothing of all that glory which accompanied him on earth, and of all that homage which was paid him. Con&s;igned to a little &s;pot of ground, where &s;ilence and horror prevail, he has only a marble monument; which already begins to be effaced, and which would &s;carcely be &s;een, if we were not purpo&s;ely directed to it.</P>
<P>IS this, then, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, all that remains of the bu&s;y tumult of the world? Is it to this, that nobility of birth, and the mo&s;t brilliant fortune lead us?</P>
<P>YES, my children, this is the &s;um of all our expectations, as to any thing earthly, whatever riches and dignities you enjoy. Death will place you on a level with the meane&s;t of our fellow creatures; it will reduce you to du&s;t &s;imilar to their's, both in weight and value: Keep then your eyes ever fixed on this period of human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is this which will teach you, that you are nothing but frailty; and that the pride, which is almo&s;t in&s;eparable from an exalted &s;tation, is the perfection of folly. Notwith&s;tanding all the privileges of your birth, all your titles, and all your advantages, you cannot command a moment's exi&s;tence: Amid&s;t all your grandeur, you are in the power of the lowe&s;t men, of the elements which govern you, of the di&s;ea&s;es which threaten you, and of a thou&s;and accidents, which you cannot fore&s;ee. Your &s;oul is as &s;ubject to &s;orrow, and your body
<PB N="108" REF="029954_0061_0FE38282A8CB4C60">
to pain, as that of the meane&s;t &s;lave; and the poor pea&s;ant, whom perhaps you de&s;pi&s;e, enjoys the &s;ame &s;un, the &s;ame climate with your&s;elf, and has the &s;ame faculties of &s;ight, ta&s;te, and perception.</P>
<P>WHY then, my children, &s;hould &s;uch a difference be made betwixt per&s;ons alike in &s;o many re&s;pects? Is it becau&s;e there is &s;uch a di&s;parity in their birth? No: Every one knows, that we all have one common father, that our origin is from the earth; and that many a man owes his eminence of &s;tation to in&s;tances of meanne&s;s, if not of downright wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>IS it becau&s;e they are con&s;igned to live by the labour of their hands? In this they only fulfil the obligation univer&s;ally laid upon mankind. Is it becau&s;e they are meanly clothed? Alas! what objects of pity are we, if we value our&s;elves upon being covered only with the &s;poils of brutes and in&s;ects!</P>
<P>WHAT connexion is there, betwixt that &s;ilk which is the produce of a worm, or that gold which we dig out of the bow|els of the earth, and an immortal &s;pirit? Surely we cannot make that &s;plendor, which is only borrowed, the &s;ubject of pride and vanity. The poore&s;t of our fellow creatures hath a body, a &s;oul, and a &s;pirit, as well as we; from whence we ought to conclude that he is our brother; and that we are much inferior to him, in &s;pite of all our grandeur and am|bition, if he has more virtues, or nobler &s;entiments, than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>HENCE learn, that you ought never to de&s;pi&s;e any one; and that he, upon whom you look down with di&s;dain, may perhaps be endued with a more generous mind than all tho&s;e great men of the world, who, while they value them&s;elves on account of their &s;uperiority, are real objects of pity. How many are there, who, if they had an opportunity of &s;hewing their abilities, would, by their genius and attainments, eclip&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="029954_0061_0FE38282A8CB4C60">
tho&s;e men of fortune, who look down upon them with di&s;dain! And whom the patronage of one man of rank, or one fortu|nate circum&s;tance, might have rai&s;ed to that degree of honour to which their abilities entitled them!</P>
<P>IT is therefore neither ob&s;curity of birth, nor poverty, which lowers us in the eye of rea&s;on; but it is pride; becau&s;e there is nothing which is in reality &s;o abject, as this vice and its effects. It is always an indication either of a mean &s;pirit, or a corrupt heart. How can we de&s;pi&s;e others, without ca&s;t|ing at the &s;ame time a reflection on our&s;elves? But were this not the ca&s;e, what, I pray you, do you think we lo&s;e of our riches or our quality, by receiving with a gracious air all who approach us, and by addre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves with conde&s;cen|&s;ion to our inferiors?</P>
<P>ALAS! the man, who is fooli&s;hly puffed up with a &s;en&s;e of his own importance, lo&s;es eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing by his haughty air, and his imperious mode of behavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; For he lo&s;es the confidence and e&s;teem of mankind, which is the mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the world.</P>
<P>MEN of inferior rank are generally a match for tho&s;e among their &s;uperiors, who treat them with contempt; for they are &s;carce out of their &s;ight, before they ridicule their whims and pride, and make them the &s;ubject of their plea|&s;antry and &s;atire.</P>
<P>O! MY children, if ever you &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the lea&s;t of your brethren, if ever you &s;hould treat them with di&s;dain; you would di&s;honour the memory of your father. He never thought him&s;elf great, but when it gave him an opportunity of obliging others; and in him the weak and indigent found kindne&s;s and relief. He removed their &s;orrows; he an&s;wered them with gentlene&s;s: And if he found him&s;elf con&s;trained to refu&s;e
<PB N="110" REF="029954_0062_0FE3828C9025CDE8">
them what they a&s;ked, he plainly &s;hewed how much concern it gave him.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, that your elevated &s;tation &s;tands in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men of inferior rank to &s;upport it; and that if you had not people in &s;ubjection to your commands, you would lead a life of the mo&s;t dreary &s;olitude, and of extreme indigence. Some labour to &s;upply you with food, others offer you their per&s;onal &s;ervice; and it is their pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;id|uous attendance which form your train, and render you an object of public notice.</P>
<P>WE are therefore enemies to our own intere&s;t, when we de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e, on whom we are &s;o dependent for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The generality of great men are re&s;pected only in proportion to their retinue; &s;o that they owe almo&s;t all their con&s;equence to the very per&s;ons, whom they do not regard. O! how happy is it for us, when we know how to do ju&s;tice to our|&s;elves; when we have judgment enough to e&s;timate our&s;elves according to our real worth!</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more dreadful than this arrogance of mind; which, carrying a man beyond the limits of an earthly being, renders him the &s;courge of every one about him. Might not you, my children, have been born the children of a pea&s;ant, or mechanic? And if this was not your lot, can you a&s;&s;ume any merit to your&s;elves on this account? As to mental endowments, however penetrating, or exten&s;ive you may &s;up|po&s;e them, they are no more than a glimmering light, too often ready to mi&s;lead you: And which oftentimes &s;hines only, at the expen&s;e of &s;ound wi&s;dom. Men of the greate&s;t genius frequently commit the greate&s;t faults: Where wit is predom|inant, di&s;cretion is &s;eldom found.</P>
<P>THE more clo&s;ely a man examines him&s;elf, the more ready he will be to acknowledge his weakne&s;s and infirmity. It is
<PB N="111" REF="029954_0062_0FE3828C9025CDE8">
only with re&s;pect to our immortal part, that we are truly great: But in order to de&s;erve this character, we mu&s;t be rai&s;ed above our pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;pecially above pride. It is a vice which we ought not to know, except that we may avoid it: It mars our be&s;t actions; and leaves to him, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, nothing but what is mean and ridiculous.</P>
<P>ONLY ob&s;erve the man, who is wrapt up in him&s;elf, and is full of the admiration of his equipage and his gaudy clothes; and you will perceive a degree of emptine&s;s in him, which you cannot but pity. The poor vain creature labours for no other purpo&s;e, than to make him&s;elf contemptible; while only a &s;mile, or an obliging look, would conciliate the affections, and win the hearts of all with whom he conver&s;es. An air of affability, and a word of kindne&s;s, is &s;ufficient to gain a thou&s;and prai&s;es, and a thou&s;and thanks. From which you may conclude, that every man of quality, who incurs the ha|tred of others, through the neglect of that, which would co&s;t him &s;o little, either a look or a word, or an air, is in effect a dupe to his own pride, and really a very de&s;picable being.</P>
<P>O! MY children, to whatever rank fortune may hereafter rai&s;e you, never forget to &s;hew a plea&s;ing conde&s;cen&s;ion in your whole deportment. Men generally vow vengeance again&s;t tho&s;e, who think them&s;elves rai&s;ed above their follow-crea|tures, only to aggravate the mi&s;eries of the wretched; to overwhelm them with the weight of their pride; to make them the &s;port of their capricious humour; to oblige them to a painful attendance in antechambers, where they are wearied out with impatience and di&s;gu&s;t. Every &s;pecies of greatne&s;s, which is thus a&s;&s;uming, is nothing better than ab&s;olute ty|ranny.</P>
<P>TO one who contemplates, as I do at pre&s;ent, the maje&s;ty of GOD, how fooli&s;h as well as criminal doth the pride of man
<PB N="112" REF="029954_0063_0FE3829170AF1AB0">
appear! How &s;en&s;ibly &s;hould I be afflicted, if I fore&s;aw, that you would hereafter behave your&s;elves with in&s;olence, and become di&s;tingui&s;hed by your haughty and imperious deport|ment! But I am per&s;uaded, this will not be the ca&s;e: You will rather endeavour to imitate the courte&s;y and affability of your father. And I tru&s;t you will acquit your mother of ar|rogance, if &s;he &s;hould venture to urge her own example, as not unworthy of your imitation in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>HEAVEN, which knows my mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, knows that I de&s;ire neither riches nor honours for you: If ye are only good men, you will be always &s;ufficiently great.</P>
<P>O! MY beloved children, if you could penetrate into my inmo&s;t thoughts, you could not doubt of my &s;incerity; I con&s;ider this union of hearts, as the only means of being always together. Death may indeed de&s;troy the body, but it has no power over our affection: This is my comfort, when the idea of our approaching &s;eparation depre&s;&s;es my &s;pirits. It is then, I have recour&s;e to my intelligent and im|mortal principle; in who&s;e love and affection, as it were in a &s;anctuary, you are to live forever, and make part of my hap|pine&s;s. It is then, I con&s;ole my&s;elf with reflecting, that I &s;hall not be ab&s;olutely deprived of you; but that in &s;pite of all the ravages of death, I &s;hall retain you in my mind and affections. The triumph of the cruel tyrant will only be par|tial: Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, that our union is indi&s;&s;oluble, wonder not that my prayers to GOD are ince&s;&s;ant, that he would pre&s;erve you, and pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> down his choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings upon you.</P>
<P>THE more I think of you, the more I find my&s;elf intere&s;ted in all you have, and do, and are; and it is this, which height|ens my affection to an inexpre&s;&s;ible degree, that you are my own fle&s;h and blood. What &s;tronger motive can there be, mo&s;t tenderly to love you?</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="029954_0063_0FE3829170AF1AB0">I MAY truly &s;ay, I forget almo&s;t every other thing for your &s;akes: Scarcely any thing, except my children's welfare, hath any longer a place in my heart. It is natural therefore for me to avail my&s;elf of the little time I have to remain upon earth, by &s;eeing as much of you as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>EXCUSE me, I pray you, to my friends, when I am departed hence. Tell them, that the duties of a parent &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed every other, that I confined my attention entirely to my fam|ily; to give ea&s;e to my mind, and di&s;charge my la&s;t duties. A&s;&s;ure them, that they had neverthele&s;s a &s;hare in my regard; and that the remembrance of their kindne&s;s dwelt on my mind to my late&s;t moment. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hank them for the attention, which they have ever &s;hewn me; and which, I am very &s;en&s;ible, was more than I de&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE &s;ad commi&s;&s;ion, which I am giving you to deliver to my friends, is like conver&s;ing with you after my death: Ere long, you will hear your mother &s;poken of, as a &s;hadow that is departed; you will then recollect all my tenderne&s;s, and do ju&s;tice to my love.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XIV. <HI>On</HI> FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>I EXPECT the return of every evening, with all the im|patience that can be conceived. Neither the temporary relief of medicines, nor the cheering light of the &s;un, affords me any con&s;olation; nothing can do this, but the happy op|portunity afforded me of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with you. You will hardly believe, that I reckoned every hour of the la&s;t night; only grieving that they did not pa&s;s with greater expe|dition,
<PB N="114" REF="029954_0064_0FE3829A763DC1E8">
in order to ha&s;ten this plea&s;ing interview. Surely my tenderne&s;s for you exceeds the bounds of rea&s;on; otherwi&s;e I could not pre&s;ume in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to wi&s;h that the time &s;hould pa&s;s with more rapidity than it does, when &s;o very little remains for me: But let us improve that little; and let us di&s;cour&s;e this evening, on the nece&s;&s;ity of prudence in the choice of Friends.</P>
<P>IF we are right in &s;aying that a true friend is a trea&s;ure; we may be equally &s;ure, that a fal&s;e one is a mon&s;ter. He abu&s;es the confidence we place in him, to our injury; and makes &s;port of the affection, which we &s;hew him: There are hypocrites in friend&s;hip, as well as in religion.</P>
<P>BUT there is nothing, my children, more agreeable or u&s;e|ful to mankind, than friend&s;hip: Without this, the happie&s;t life leaves a vacuum which can never be filled.</P>
<P>THERE are a thou&s;and ca&s;es, in which we have need of coun&s;el or a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a thou&s;and &s;ituations, in which we de|rive comfort from the &s;ight of a friend: He is a &s;upport in our adver&s;ity; a MENTOR, to recal our wandering &s;teps.</P>
<P>GENTLENESS of manners, and a compliance of di&s;po&s;i|tion, will &s;ecure to you all the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip: But if you are not upon your guard again&s;t external appearances, you will run the ri&s;que either of having fal&s;e friends, or of having no friend at all.</P>
<P>YOUR choice mu&s;t not be determined either by an agree|able countenance, or a lively turn of conver&s;ation, or a bril|liancy of wit; we are often en&s;nared by the&s;e exterior ac|compli&s;hments. But experience will teach you, that there is nothing &s;o deceitful as words, and looks.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t penetrate into the very &s;oul of him, whom you wi&s;h really to know: If you li&s;ten only to the public voice, you will find your judgment equally divided betwixt &s;atire
<PB N="115" REF="029954_0064_0FE3829A763DC1E8">
and panegyric, and you will not know which &s;ide to take. I never knew a per&s;on, who had not his &s;hare of good and evil report. While &s;ome commend him, others blame him; and it is almo&s;t always prejudice, which determines both the one and the other.</P>
<P>BUT how, you will a&s;k, &s;hall we get at the heart of him, with whom we &s;eek to be united in friend&s;hip? Your own under&s;tanding will teach you the way: That will make you attentive to tho&s;e words and actions, which are purely nat|ural, and unpreme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted; and which unfold the inmo&s;t re|ce&s;&s;es of the heart. That will teach you to watch the pre|vailing inclination of the per&s;on, whom you wi&s;h to take into your bo&s;om; and to attend to his different pur&s;uits, and con|nexions: That will &s;hew you in the mirror of the mind, I mean the eyes, whether there be &s;weetne&s;s, anger, or pride in him.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;tudy others, when we have been accu&s;tomed to &s;tudy our&s;elves; but unhappily this &s;elf-inquiry is too much neglected. We read, with eagerne&s;s, books on every &s;ubject; but we do not give our&s;elves the trouble to &s;earch into that in&s;tructive volume, the human heart: Thus it deceives us every moment; and makes us pay dearly for our negligence in this matter.</P>
<P>BUT, how great advantages would ari&s;e from this inquiry! We &s;hould know the origin of all the evil that we do; we &s;hould learn by what means our prevailing pa&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t ea&s;ily attacked; and we &s;hould have none but real friends.</P>
<P>LIBERTINES and game&s;ters have tho&s;e qualities, which would only &s;erve to ruin us. Not to mention, that they are levity and incon&s;i&s;tency it&s;elf; they communicate a love of vice, and take a plea&s;ure in making pro&s;elytes, like them|&s;elves. Every vicious man &s;eeks to ju&s;tify his conduct by the
<PB N="116" REF="029954_0065_0FE3829F1CD8B078">
authority of others; and this he hopes to effect, by making converts: As if it were in the power of a multitude to deter|mine virtue to be vice, or vice virtue.</P>
<P>IT is not in the circle of irregularity, or in the lap of plea|&s;ure, that you will meet with minds &s;u&s;ceptible of true friend|&s;hip: For &s;he is prudent and di&s;creet; and young men en|&s;laved to their pa&s;&s;ions are intemperate and precipitate. You need not &s;ee them more than once, to know them tho|roughly; they commend nothing but plea&s;ure; they admire nothing but di&s;&s;ipation; they &s;peak of nothing but what is injurious to religion and morality; all which are the &s;trong|e&s;t arguments again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch per&s;ons into your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould make choice of one that is fond of play; he would &s;oon per&s;uade you, that his pa&s;&s;ion is a certain re&s;ource again&s;t dulne&s;s and misfortunes; that the gaming table is the rendezvous of the be&s;t company; that it is very agreea|ble to make &s;uch great intere&s;t of one's money; 'till, in &s;hort, he prevails, and you are undone. Connect your&s;elf with a man of plea&s;ure, and he will tell you there is no hap|pine&s;s but in &s;en&s;ual gratifications; and in the end will per|vert your under&s;tanding, and corrupt your affections: One in&s;en&s;ibly becomes wicked, by conver&s;ing with &s;uch as are wickedly di&s;po&s;ed; this is an opinion, which is confirmed by rea&s;on and &s;ad experience.</P>
<P>AN ill-di&s;po&s;ed friend involves us in every kind of misfor|tune; and the wounds which he gives us are &s;o much the more dangerous, becau&s;e he often goes down with us into the pit which he has digged for us. His kindne&s;s en&s;nares us; and though we &s;ee we are the dupes of his folly, we have no longer re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="029954_0065_0FE3829F1CD8B078">I HAVE already exhorted you to leave the choice of your friends to Virtue, which will pre&s;erve you from the&s;e dangers. She is intelligent, without &s;u&s;picion, and has the be&s;t means of di&s;covering the truth; &s;uch a choice is too important to excu&s;e our inadvertency and neglect.</P>
<P>HOW many are there, who&s;e fortune or who&s;e virtue would have been ruined, had it not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend! He becomes their guide; he &s;hews them a &s;afe and ea&s;y way, and his directions are attended with the mo&s;t happy effects. We ea&s;ily &s;uffer our&s;elves to be per&s;uaded, when it is Friend&s;hip that &s;peaks: She knows the di&s;po&s;itions of the heart, and di&s;covers her&s;elf in &s;pite of every cloud and every impediment.</P>
<P>HOW happy will you be, if ever you are ble&s;t with a real friend! He will be a living book, in which you may read your duty; and your own affection being joined with his, there will be only one mind, and one will betwixt you. When we are united by generous &s;entiments, we mutually encourage each other to every thing that is good: There is &s;omething &s;acred in friend&s;hip, when it is animated by virtue.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t not expect to find true friends, if we do not u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to de&s;erve them: There is nothing more common than to hear people complain of the &s;carcity of friends, and nothing more rare than to &s;ee them &s;tudious to cultivate friend&s;hip. We are not apt to think, that friend&s;hip is a commerce, which mu&s;t be carried on at a mutual expen&s;e.</P>
<P>DO not accu&s;tom your&s;elves to call any man your friend, whom you have not proved, and whom you do not know to be &s;uch: Be hone&s;t, &s;incere, and agreeable your&s;elves; and I will be an&s;werable for it, that the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip
<PB N="118" REF="029954_0066_0FE382A6A114D770">
&s;hall be your's. We form connections too ha&s;tily, to have real friends; and we change them too often, to know their value: There is too much levity to be met with every where, and only the &s;hadow of friend&s;hip to be &s;een.</P>
<P>WHAT a di&s;mal &s;tate is it, to wander about the world, with|out a creature in whom we can &s;afely confide! to live always in re&s;erve with tho&s;e, whom we conver&s;e with. A true friend delivers us from this re&s;traint: He is of more value to us, than all the world, without him. While we &s;ee, and conver&s;e with him, we think of nothing that is removed at a di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>I MYSELF experienced the ble&s;&s;ing of a friend, in one, whom Providence threw in my way, when I was young: Her coun&s;els, and her excellent virtues, fir&s;t began to &s;hew me the folly and vanity of a di&s;&s;ipated life. I tru&s;t her goodne&s;s to|wards me has not failed of its reward! Were &s;he now alive, &s;he would &s;upply my place to you; my eyes have a thou&s;and times be&s;towed the tribute of a tear upon her; and to my la|te&s;t breath, I &s;hall not cea&s;e to regret her lo&s;s.</P>
<P>IT was in the friend&s;hip of this excellent woman, that I learnt to rai&s;e my mind above the trifles of the world; and that I found by experience that our happine&s;s chiefly depends on the choice of a friend.</P>
<P>INDEED, my children, a virtuous per&s;on, to whom we can at all times with &s;afety unbo&s;om our&s;elves, is of more u&s;e to us, than either books or conver&s;ation; when we are agitated by our pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;eek an a&s;ylum in his brea&s;t, and find that tranquillity, which we &s;o much want.</P>
<P>ONLY make your ob&s;ervation on two faithful friends; li&s;ten to them, and you will find in their language and their &s;entiments, a degree of candor and benevolence, that will charm you. If they de&s;cant on the emptine&s;s of earthly hon|ours,
<PB N="119" REF="029954_0066_0FE382A6A114D770">
it is the voice of rea&s;on; if they give an account of their affairs, it is done with the utmo&s;t openne&s;s and integrity. They adhere clo&s;ely to the dictates of virtue; the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upports the weaker; the wi&s;er in&s;tructs the more ignorant; each is content with his own mea&s;ure of knowledge: And in this little &s;ociety, neither wi&s;hes to have the pre-eminence.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not &s;ay &s;o much on the &s;ubject of friend&s;hip, if it were not &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in human life. Of what &s;ervice may you find a friend, amid&s;t the perils of war! It is very po&s;&s;ible that he may &s;ave your life; we &s;ee in&s;tances of it every day: Your uncle can inform you, that after a bloody battle, he was found fallen among the dead; and that the Count de * * *, in&s;tigated by friend&s;hip, came to &s;ee if there were any &s;igns of life in him, and delivered him from the hands of tho&s;e who were preparing to bury him.</P>
<P>YOU are now arrived at a proper age to think of making &s;uch friends: A friend&s;hip, begun in our youth, is a band not ea&s;ily broken. Experience will teach you, that the generality of per&s;ons, whom you meet with in the world, are only fit for the intercour&s;e of common civility; and that the number of tho&s;e, among whom a friend is to be cho&s;en, is very &s;mall. Let this choice be directed by rea&s;on, as well as the affections; and you will never then have cau&s;e to repent of it.</P>
<P>WE are never more &s;en&s;ible of the true value of a friend, than when we labour under any &s;ickne&s;s or misfortune. The courtier pa&s;&s;es by, and does not remember that he ever &s;aw you; the man of the world &s;ends to enquire after you, and proceeds no farther: But the real friend ri&s;ques every thing; nay, quits every thing, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort you. He divides him&s;elf, he multiplies him&s;elf; he knows no greater plea&s;ure, than in opening his heart, and di&s;covering the &s;incerity of his affection: We are always ready to di&s;clo&s;e our hearts, when we have nothing but virtues to &s;hew.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="029954_0067_0FE382ABE90D52B8">HEAVEN grant, that the&s;e reflections may imprint on your minds, tho&s;e &s;entiments which friend&s;hip in&s;pires. This is the wi&s;h of your be&s;t and deare&s;t friend, who delights in &s;ee|ing you; who&s;e heart is tran&s;ported with plea&s;ure in conver|&s;ing with you! I am already ab&s;olutely dead to the world; it is only in you, that I &s;eem to live and breathe. O! my too tenderly beloved children! To what an orphan-&s;tate are you now about to be reduced! Where are the per&s;ons, whom you will hereafter call by the &s;acred name of friends? How happy &s;hould I be, to know them! How extremely dear would they be to me! I &s;hould con&s;ider them as &s;upplying my place in your affections. I &s;hould conjure them to be forever at|tached to you; both out of tenderne&s;s for you, and compa&s;&s;ion for me.</P>
<P>ALAS! my whole &s;oul is di&s;ordered by &s;uch reflections as the&s;e: All my thoughts are thrown into confu&s;ion. And nothing remains to me, but the pain of lo&s;ing you; a pain, which has yet a mixture of plea&s;ure, even while it over|whelms me: And which, indeed, I would not but feel, for all the world.</P>
<P>THAT ever I &s;hould be de&s;tined to experience &s;uch a con|trariety of &s;en&s;ations! My heart &s;eems to be divided, and my &s;oul is in a &s;tate of di&s;traction; my tenderne&s;s is agitated at the &s;ame time by &s;entiments of a quite different nature: What a &s;trange &s;ituation! My love of my children, whil&s;t it heightens my joy, embitters my &s;orrow. If my affection is properly returned by you, I &s;hall have abundant rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied: Yet do I &s;till lament your fate.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XV. <HI>On the</HI> COURT.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is my de&s;ign to give you &s;ome in&s;tructions in rela|tion to every circum&s;tance of your life; I think I ought to &s;ay &s;omething to you on the &s;ubject of the Court. The &s;pot, which you will have occa&s;ion mo&s;t frequently to vi&s;it, is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable part of the kingdom, as being the re&s;i|dence of the &s;overeign. There it is, that the hearts of all his &s;ubjects &s;hould be fixed; thence it is, that favors and benefits are wont to flow.</P>
<P>BUT you mu&s;t know that &s;elf-love, and our own intere&s;t, being the fir&s;t mover almo&s;t in every action, they who frequent the court are carried thither by motives of ambition, and a thir&s;t for promotion: This is the center, to which every thing tends. It is here that the vehemence of de&s;ire, and the flame of pa&s;&s;ion are kindled: Here it is, that courtiers pine away with envy and impatience; and there is &s;carcely any one, who does not feel him&s;elf in an unea&s;y &s;ituation. One is afraid of lo&s;ing his place, another is apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hall put nothing; and as neither of them will venture to utter his real &s;entiments, either that he may not expo&s;e him&s;elf, or that he may not reveal his &s;ecret, they both live in a &s;tate of per|petual di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>THIS accounts for our finding more &s;u&s;picion and mi&s;tru&s;t at court, than any where el&s;e; and hence it is, that it is the place in the world in which men are lea&s;t apt to expre&s;s their
<PB N="122" REF="029954_0068_0FE382B476258AB0">
thoughts and inclinations. When this precaution does not exceed the bounds of prudence, we cannot but commend it; but when it degenerates into duplicity, it is doubtle&s;s a very great fault.</P>
<P>EXPECT then to find, within the precincts of a court, only per&s;ons of very great prudence or di&s;&s;imulation; and to &s;ee only looks, who&s;e meaning you cannot under&s;tand. They often laugh, when they have great cau&s;e to weep; and &s;ome|times weep, when they have occa&s;ion to rejoice. They publicly prai&s;e their enemies, if they happen to be favorites at court; and they cen&s;ure even their friends, if they chance to be out of favour. Fortune is the compa&s;s by which the cour&s;e of their friend&s;hip is directed; the thermometer, which &s;hews the degree of warmth or coolne&s;s, with which people are to be addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>YOU will &s;ee, that neither openne&s;s nor freedom are the cur|rent coin of this place; and that the only way to maintain your ground there is to pay a proper re&s;pect to all, but to place confidence in none. Never to &s;ay the lea&s;t evil of any, be|cau&s;e the weake&s;t has power to hurt; to confine your&s;elves within your proper &s;phere; and to have nothing to do with intrigues or cabals. To a&s;k no favours, or at lea&s;t to u&s;e the utmo&s;t di&s;cretion in a&s;king them; to give no occa&s;ion either for panegyric or &s;atire. Equally to avoid the haughty appearance of pride, and the mean artifices of flattery; to pre&s;erve at all times an evenne&s;s of temper, and never to &s;hew too much &s;en|&s;ibility. People are apt to mi&s;tru&s;t a man of wit and humour; they &s;uppo&s;e that he is always de&s;igning: And they &s;u&s;pect, that what he &s;ays is not &s;incere.</P>
<P>LAY down the&s;e maxims for the direction of your conduct; and I will venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that whatever dangers may attend the court, it will have none to en&s;nare you. It is not
<PB N="123" REF="029954_0068_0FE382B476258AB0">
the path of ambition, which I am pointing out to you, but that of an hone&s;t man; who &s;eeks to get the better of his own faults, and only a&s;pires after true happine&s;s. The ambitious man hazards all for all: If his exaltation may render him con&s;picuous, his fall may be utterly de&s;tructive to him. Whereas, with virtue, and a generous moderation, we leave fortune to act as &s;he plea&s;es; neither coveting her favours, nor dreading her frowns.</P>
<P>IT is doubtle&s;s a very plea&s;ing &s;ituation to be honoured with the confidence of a royal ma&s;ter, and to be employed in his name to partake of the concerns of government. But how much trouble and di&s;appointment mu&s;t you expect, before you arrive at &s;uch a po&s;t of honour! And what perpetual inquie|tude mu&s;t you &s;uffer to maintain it! You will not have a moment, that you can call your own; your time mu&s;t be wholly devoted to public affairs. And you mu&s;t be intent on ju&s;tifying the choice which your &s;overeign has made of you, by ince&s;&s;ant indu&s;try, and by an unwearied anxiety for the general welfare.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een enough of the court, and of the manner of courtiers, to be able to a&s;&s;ure you, that no one there is happy, but he who de&s;ires nothing. Is it not a &s;ufficient honour and privilege to be permitted to approach our prince; to be known by him, and to have it in our power to &s;hew by our a&s;&s;iduity, how much we love him, and how de&s;irous we are to &s;erve him?</P>
<P>WHEN we are only engaged in con&s;ulting the intere&s;t of our King, we find a court the re&s;idence of true greatne&s;s and vir|tue; but when we think only of our own intere&s;t, we find there nothing but intrigues, and jealou&s;y, and di&s;&s;imulation. It is not the &s;overeigns, or their family, which render the court a place of danger; but the faulty pa&s;&s;ions which we
<PB N="124" REF="029954_0069_0FE382B91C0AF098">
carry thither, and which an ambitious de&s;ire of advancement puts in a &s;tate of fermentation. A prince cannot &s;ee every thing him&s;elf; and as the greate&s;t part of his courtiers are accu&s;tomed to di&s;gui&s;e, his court does not appear to him &s;uch as it really is.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t, above all things, beware of learning there that political refinement, which has not the lea&s;t connexion with truth; that fondne&s;s for luxury, which plunges us into idle expen&s;es; that effeminacy, which enervates both the body and mind; that haughtine&s;s of &s;pirit, which knows no plea|&s;ure, but that of depre&s;&s;ing others. A good di&s;po&s;ition will imitate nothing but virtues; bad examples &s;erve only to ren|der it more circum&s;pect and attentive to its duty.</P>
<P>IF it be true, that a court has its inconveniences, it is no le&s;s true that it has al&s;o great advantages: It is the centre of true politene&s;s; it is the re&s;idence of the pure&s;t language; a certain mode of behaviour there prevails, which is not el&s;e|where to be found, and which characteri&s;es per&s;ons of quality. It is there we become acquainted with the nece&s;&s;ary forms, and what is u&s;ually called ETIQUETTE: The manner of behaving our&s;elves with gracefulne&s;s, and of expre&s;&s;ing our|&s;elves with propriety; of receiving others with dignity, and of writing with elegance and ea&s;e. You will not have continued there long, without learning the art of being polite without impertinence, re&s;erved without &s;tiffne&s;s, &s;teady without rudene&s;s, and grave without affectation. Courtiers &s;ay many things in few words: They know every thing, yet pretend to know nothing; that is, they are &s;o guarded, that yet can neither gue&s;s what are their real &s;entiments, nor quot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their authority for what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>CHOOSE tho&s;e characters for your examples, which are mo&s;t generally e&s;teemed: There are always to be found at
<PB N="125" REF="029954_0069_0FE382B91C0AF098">
court, venerable peers, who&s;e company is the &s;chool of honour and integrity; re&s;pectable ladies, who&s;e example is a le&s;&s;on of virtue. The&s;e are the per&s;ons, to whom you will do well mo&s;t intimately to attach your&s;elves: You will gain their good will by li&s;tening to them with attention; by frequenting their com|pany; by a well &s;upported conduct, and by mode&s;ty and di&s;|cretion. The court is only dangerous to tho&s;e, who give them&s;elves up to plea&s;ure or ambition; we can every where find bad examples, when we give our&s;elves the trouble to look after them.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould have a place at court, you will do well to re|member that it is only borrowed; and be always ready to re|&s;ign it: This will be the &s;ure&s;t means of confirming you in it, and of &s;ecuring you from any fear of revolutions. Courts are like ground that is undermined: When we think our&s;elves mo&s;t &s;ecure, we are in the mo&s;t imminent danger of falling in.</P>
<P>IF you only appear there to pay the re&s;pect, which is due from you; if you are only anxious to procure e&s;teem; behave your&s;elves with politene&s;s to all the world: And above all things avoid the character of news-mongers, or banterers; the lea&s;t degree of raillery is always ill received. The court is the re&s;idence of extreme di&s;cretion; they are always talk|ing there, without affirming any thing.</P>
<P>THERE is no place in the world in which there is more wit, and in which it is more dangerous to &s;hew it. Shew nothing there but plain good &s;en&s;e; that, you will find, is the way to commit no faults, and to have no enemies: We can|not be too circum&s;pect, when we live in the mid&s;t of a world, in which every thing is &s;een, and every thing is blazed abroad.</P>
<P>NEVER boa&s;t that you have intere&s;t, if fortune &s;hould give it you: Either you will be be&s;et by dependents, who&s;e appli|cations you mu&s;t refu&s;e, and which a good heart &s;uffers great|ly
<PB N="126" REF="029954_0070_0FE382C38AF3D540">
in refu&s;ing; or you mu&s;t be always a&s;king favours, and thereby weakening your own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>AVOID the &s;ociety of intriguing women; they almo&s;t al|ways ruin tho&s;e, whom they appear to protect. Their coun|&s;els &s;educe; they fan the flames of ambition; and all they aim at is to form parties, of which you will at length become the victim.</P>
<P>PAY no regard to the friend&s;hip, which they profe&s;s for you, or to the que&s;tions, which they will not fail to a&s;k you. Their friend&s;hip may be &s;incere, but it may perhaps be in&s;idious; and in a matter of doubt, prudence pre&s;cribes, that we &s;teer clear of danger. There are too many jarring intere&s;ts at court, to think that people there are di&s;intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>WHAT I am now recommending to you is not craftine&s;s, but prudence; you will not be le&s;s the friends to truth, for knowing how to hold your peace, and act with re&s;erve: It is a kind of policy which religion allows, and which it calls by the name of di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>WE find fault with the court, as being the region of toil|&s;ome attendance and fatigue; and not without rea&s;on, when we give our&s;elves up to idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure. But if you are fond of reading, and make temperance the rule of your con|duct; you will find you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;elves as happy there, as in any other place. Satiety belongs only to tho&s;e who pur&s;ue &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures alone, and who wi&s;h to be always enjoying them: Let YOUR happine&s;s center in your own minds, and it will always then be at your command.</P>
<P>BUT enough, my children, on this &s;ubject; experience will teach you the re&s;t: She is an admirable in&s;tructre&s;s; and it is to her I refer my&s;elf, every time I conver&s;e with you. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to conceive what agitation my mind &s;u&s;tains, while I am giving you the&s;e directions for your
<PB N="127" REF="029954_0070_0FE382C38AF3D540">
future conduct. I cannot help wi&s;hing to look into futurity, that I might know whether the coun&s;el which I give you, is exactly &s;uch as will be of u&s;e to you hereafter; or whether you will be di&s;po&s;ed to follow it at all. I am always thinking, and therefore it is no wonder that I am ince&s;&s;antly repeating, how dreadful is the &s;ituation of that mother, who wi&s;hes to attend her children through their whole life, but is obliged to leave them: Who is earne&s;tly de&s;irous to know in what man|ner they will hereafter conduct them&s;elves, what will become of them: And yet cannot, with all her efforts of fore&s;ight and tenderne&s;s, go one &s;tep beyond the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>IT is a melancholy reflection, that I am at this time anx|ious to give you advice for the regulation of a life, which per|haps will very &s;oon be taken away from you. Who knows, alas! But that the fir&s;t campaign may carry you off, in the mid&s;t of all your hopes; and in the flower of that youth, of which you are at pre&s;ent in the full enjoyment. Some unex|pected accident may perhaps open YOUR tomb, almo&s;t as &s;oon as mine is &s;hut. Such are the &s;ad reflections, which di&s;tract my mind; ari&s;ing, doubtle&s;s, in part, from the increa&s;ing weakne&s;s of my outward frame. They hang over me like a thick cloud, which I am unable to remove.</P>
<P>TO my own lot I am no &s;tranger; my pre&s;ent &s;olicitude ari&s;es from my ignorance what will be yours. O! that death would execute all its power upon me, rather than torment me with the&s;e melancholy thoughts, which ca&s;t down my &s;oul, and fill me with di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>HEAVEN has ordained, my children, that I &s;hould be taken away from you at a time, when I am deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of my duty, and am exceedingly de&s;irous to di&s;|charge it. Alas! how many mothers are there, who live in perfect indifference about their children! How many mothers,
<PB N="128" REF="029954_0071_0FE382C87A2B3470">
who only regard their plea&s;ures; while I have this great rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to live, that I might be of u&s;e to you: And that I might be in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving you from tho&s;e dangers, to which your youth is about to be expo&s;ed!</P>
<P>GRIEVOUS indeed was the &s;troke, when it was the will of heaven to deprive you of your father; it now &s;eemeth good to the &s;ame un&s;earchable wi&s;dom, to double your affliction. Submit therefore in all humility to that di&s;pen&s;ation, which not the mo&s;t co&s;tly &s;acrifices, nor all that your affection could po&s;&s;ibly prompt you to be&s;tow, will be able to avert.</P>
<P>BUT, what do I &s;ay? You may perhaps imagine, that the pro&s;pect of death di&s;quiets me; whereas death hath utterly lo&s;t its &s;ting. You will not, I hope, &s;u&s;pect that I am un|willing to &s;ubmit to the will of Providence, all who&s;e de&s;igns I humbly and reverently adore. Pardon, gracious Lord, the expiring efforts of parental affection; which overcomes me, in my pre&s;ent &s;tate of languor and decay.</P>

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XVI. <HI>On the</HI> LOVE <HI>of</HI> TRUTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of this evening's conver&s;ation &s;hall be that infallible characteri&s;tic of a generous mind, the love of Truth. You cannot but know, that nothing is more dete&s;t|able than fal&s;ehood; and that whoever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes from truth is held in utter contempt.</P>
<P>BE a&s;&s;ured, my dear children, you will no longer be e&s;|teemed, than while you &s;trictly adhere to truth. The world,
<PB N="129" REF="029954_0071_0FE382C87A2B3470">
corrupt as it is, never yet &s;poke of a liar with re&s;pect; it even prote&s;ts again&s;t tho&s;e flattering compliments, which lead us to commend tho&s;e that are unworthy of prai&s;e: So certain is it, that truth is always acceptable, and that her rights are never to be invaded with impunity.</P>
<P>WHAT would you &s;ay of me, my children, if you found that the affection, which I profe&s;s to bear towards you, was all di&s;&s;embled; and that my words were the language of im|po&s;ture: That the regret which I have expre&s;&s;ed at being re|moved from you, and &s;eeing you no more, was merely the effect of artifice and in&s;incerity? Doubtle&s;s you would be of|fended to &s;ee me trifle with truth, and pro&s;titute parental af|fection. But be a&s;&s;ured, the contrary is true; each word, that I utter, is the dictate of &s;incere&s;t love: Nor do I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify my&s;elf in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>ALAS! of what u&s;e would it be to me, to a&s;&s;ume the cha|racter of an anxious or afflicted mother? This would be far enough from giving you plea&s;ure; nor can I have the lea&s;t intere&s;t in impo&s;ing upon you. If I wi&s;hed to do it, in order to make my&s;elf of &s;ome con&s;equence in the world, death is about to remove me from it; and I have nothing here below to expect, but the &s;troke it is about to give me.</P>
<P>CONSIGNED in a very &s;hort time to the regions of eternal &s;ilence, I &s;hall neither know what is &s;aid, nor what is thought of me. None of the concerns of this life will any longer af|fect me, except perhaps the love which I bear you; and which will, I hope, be perfected in endle&s;s joy, on &s;eeing you again, received into the region<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of eternal life.</P>
<P>THAT truth, which is &s;o amiable and con&s;picuous upon earth, is no other than an emanation from, and as it were, the image of, the Deity: And the rea&s;on why we hold it in &s;uch high e&s;timation is, becau&s;e we know that it proceeds
<PB N="130" REF="029954_0072_0FE382D22D563380">
from heaven. How great is its beauty, how clear its light, when it penetrates the heart and &s;oul! From the moment of its entrance, the mind becomes the &s;eat of equity and can|dor: All writings, which are de&s;titute of truth, are calcu|lated only to mi&s;lead; all men, who di&s;regard it in their manners or di&s;cour&s;e, are objects of our pity or contempt.</P>
<P>LET truth then be the guide of your conduct, the fir&s;t principle of your actions, as hereby a very material point will be gained: You will not then &s;uffer your&s;elves to be &s;e|duced by evil cu&s;toms, or bad companions: Your character will not then be marked by di&s;&s;imulation and duplicity; your words, and looks, and actions will be uniformly true.</P>
<P>YOU have happily cho&s;en tho&s;e &s;tations in life, in which truth is more particularly indi&s;pen&s;ible: A &s;oldier without the &s;tricte&s;t honour, and an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, without the mo&s;t rigid veracity, are men &s;o truly infamous, that they are looked upon with indignation. Hone&s;ty knows but one kind of language.

<P>IT is becau&s;e men are too apt to lo&s;e &s;ight of the&s;e max|ims, that the world is full of flattery and in&s;incerity. You may ob&s;erve, that unfortunately there &s;eems to be a kind of emulat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on in the art of deceiving one another; and that al|mo&s;t in every company the &s;hocking cu&s;tom is but too preva|lent, of prai&s;ing people to their faces, and cen&s;uring them the moment their backs are turned. This &s;pecies of treachery has always been exceedingly offen&s;ive to me; e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e the party &s;o treated, being ab&s;ent, is unable to defend him&s;elf: It is cutting a man's throat, without allowing him the po&s;&s;ibility of crying out for &s;uccour.</P>

<P>O! HOW amiable is truth! Her empire ran parallel with the Golden Age: The tongue was then the faithful interpre|ter of the heart; then mutual love prevailed, and each party expre&s;&s;ed it without di&s;gui&s;e. The world, as it grows old, grows more corrupt; the very nature of truth is changed; and fal&s;ehood too often dwells on the lips even of tho&s;e who have had every advantage of education.&mdash;What in fact are all idle compliments, but the art of &s;aying agreeable things which mean nothing, and of lulling people into an utter in|&s;en&s;ibility of their faults? I would by no means have you rigidly &s;evere; but I would never have you &s;acrifice truth to complai&s;ance. Truth is an inexhau&s;tible &s;pring, from which innumerable &s;treams are derived, who&s;e purity may be defiled many different ways. Some depart from it by equivocation; &s;ome by mental re&s;ervations: Neither of them recollecting, that to be a lover of truth is the greate&s;t ornament of man.</P>
<P>SUCH language, I well know would be incomprehen&s;ible to mere courtiers; but I hope I am not giving in&s;tructions to per&s;ons, who are ambitious of that &s;ort of life. The princi|ples, which I am inculcating, will never introduce you to it; if they do, my in&s;tructions mu&s;t be &s;trangely mi&s;under&s;tood. Nothing would affect me more, than to know that my child|ren would be mean flatterers, capable of deceiving their ma&s;|ter, and of betraying the intere&s;ts of the public. The very idea fills me with horror. No: Heaven, I tru&s;t, will not &s;uf|fer ambition to take &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your hearts, as to lead you to any unwarrantable exce&s;s. That you may never run

into it, &s;hall be my con&s;tant prayer; and your good di&s;po|&s;itions give me cau&s;e to hope, that my wi&s;hes will be accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>IF you improve in knowledge and virtue, as I hope you will; you will be &s;en&s;ible of the importance of keeping your word, and never contradicting your real &s;entiments: What is it but to act in two oppo&s;ite characters, when we outwardly approve what we inwardly condemn?</P>
<P>IF he, who is regardle&s;s of truth, knew what he lo&s;es by his want of uprightne&s;s and integrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he would account him&s;elf unworthy of &s;ociety. It is impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;teem &s;uch a per&s;on; no one ventures to entru&s;t him with the mo&s;t trifling &s;ecret; and even when he &s;peaks the truth, he is not believed. Other vices may be concealed, but fal&s;ehood is almo&s;t always di&s;cov|ered; and oftentimes the liar is betrayed by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>RECEIVE in&s;truction on this point from tho&s;e old officers, who&s;e names are an honour to their profe&s;&s;ion; and you will know how to regard truth as &s;he de&s;erves. It is in their &s;chool we learn, that our life it&s;elf is not too dear a price to lay down in her behalf; that e&s;teem is the companion of integrity; and that every promi&s;e which we make, without performing it, is an in&s;tance of fal&s;ehood which de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>IN proportion as I enter more deeply into reflections upon death, I di&s;cover how nece&s;&s;ary it is to regard truth. No per|&s;on in my &s;ituation can avoid mo&s;t highly re&s;pecting her, and renouncing every &s;pecies of fal&s;ehood and di&s;&s;imulation. They may indeed be found in books, or in &s;ociety; but in the eyes of tho&s;e who &s;tand on the brink of the grave, they are lighter than vanity it&s;elf. Such per&s;ons e&s;teem nothing more than veracity. Adhere to it, my children, as long as you live, and the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven will re&s;t upon you. Hate evil &s;peaking; and be as &s;low to believe, as you are backward to utter any thing to another's di&s;advantage.</P>

<P>ALL I have to add, is, that, if a &s;ingle in&s;tance of fal&s;ehood would e&s;tabli&s;h your fortune, you ought to prefer a life of in|digence before wealth &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed.

<P>THE exertion of my &s;pirits, in conver&s;ing with you on the&s;e intere&s;ting topics, may perhaps ha&s;ten my death a few days: But what is &s;uch a lo&s;s to a mother, who would freely &s;acrifice ages for your good, if &s;he had them in her own di&s;po&s;al?

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XVII. <HI>On</HI> BROTHERLY LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER an hourly apprehen&s;ion of death, I am a&s;|toni&s;hed to find my&s;elf again conver&s;ing with you. Who can le&s;s reckon upon the return of to-morrow, than one, who is already reduced to a &s;keleton? It is the will of heaven, that the undue attention, which I have formerly paid to this wretched body of mine, &s;hould be recompenced by my being an eye witne&s;s of its total decay: Wherever I turn my eyes, I &s;ee nothing but the &s;ad tokens of my approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>THERE are however &s;ome in&s;tructions, which I yet wi&s;h to give you; and that which I intend for the pre&s;ent is not one of the lea&s;t important. It relates to the harmony which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t betwixt you all; and without which, you mu&s;t never expect any peace or comfort in each other. I have therefore called you ALL together, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of my in&s;tructions equally concerns you all: This union only can repair the lo&s;s you will &s;u&s;tain by the death of your parents, and it will deliver you from a thou&s;and inconveni|ences and embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>ALL families go to decay, when they are di&s;tracted by law-&s;uits; they are torn a&s;under, they devour each other,
<PB N="135" REF="029954_0074_0FE382DF5501B368">
they mutually wi&s;h each other's ruin: Where a cordial affection does not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, there is nothing but confu&s;ion. I have &s;een &s;ome great families reduced by this to indigence: A wretched &s;elf-intere&s;ted &s;pirit had &s;owed tares in the heart of each individual belonging to them.</P>
<P>IT is covetou&s;ne&s;s, which embroils the neare&s;t relations; for the &s;ake of a little pelf, men are contented to break the bonds of con&s;anguinity and friend&s;hip: Whereas the trea&s;ures of the whole univer&s;e are not worthy to be compared with the happine&s;s of living in peace and unity. Alas! poor mortals of a day! How &s;olicitous are they about their earthly con|cerns, as if they were to dwell upon the earth forever!</P>
<P>WITH what deep concern &s;hould I be filled, if I fore&s;aw that my property could po&s;&s;ibly be the occa&s;ion of &s;trife be|twixt you! I &s;hould in that ca&s;e wi&s;h, with all my heart, to have no other inheritance to leave you, but peace and virtue; but I flatter my&s;elf, MEUM &amp; TUUM, that wretched di&s;tinc|tion which &s;o often &s;eparates chief friends, will never be al|lowed to interrupt your friend&s;hip. Nothing upon earth &s;hould be permitted to violate the bond of brotherly love.</P>
<P>SPRUNG from the &s;ame parents, brothers naturally con|tract the mo&s;t intimate union from their very birth. This friend&s;hip often grows up amid&s;t their exerci&s;es, and their &s;ports; and increa&s;es as their hearts unfold them&s;elves, and their affections are enlarged. An hu&s;band has not always known his wife; oftentimes indeed he knows little or nothing of her before marriage. But brothers and &s;i&s;ters have had the &s;ame cradle, the &s;ame examples, the &s;ame in&s;tructions, and have lived in the &s;ame way; &s;o that they are doubly to blame, if any matter of intere&s;t is &s;uffered to divide them. The more inducements we have to live in union, the more
<PB N="136" REF="029954_0075_0FE382E40BD3B1D8">
clearly do we demon&s;trate the evil di&s;po&s;ition of our hearts, when we give the lea&s;t encouragement to di&s;&s;en&s;ion.</P>
<P>IF ever you &s;hould be tempted to di&s;agree with each other; you will do well to e&s;timate, what it would co&s;t you to &s;upport your animo&s;ity, through the forms of a tedious and expen&s;ive law-&s;uit: And I will an&s;wer for it, that you will never be induced to carry matters to this cruel extremity.&mdash;Alas! the voice of con&s;anguinity is not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with impunity: She always maintains her rights; and a generous mind can never forget them, without doing the utmo&s;t violence to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HAVE ever ob&s;erved, with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction and delight, your affectionate di&s;po&s;ition towards each other; and I am per&s;uaded that the harmony, which hath hitherto prevailed betwixt you, has been as much the effect of con|genial &s;entiments, as of your own good &s;en&s;e. I thank heaven for it; and earne&s;tly be&s;eech you to pre&s;erve this concord uninterrupted. Remember, that if it is conducive to your pre&s;ent advantage to be united, it will not le&s;s contribute to your future &s;atisfaction; the longer &s;uch an union continues, the firmer it will become, and the more &s;en&s;ible you will be of the ble&s;&s;ings which attend it.</P>
<P>ALAS! how many unhappy families are there, who, hav|ing broken the bonds of friend&s;hip, are re&s;trained, by a fal&s;e &s;hame, from mutual conce&s;&s;ions, for the &s;ake of re&s;toring peace! Self-intere&s;t mu&s;t have a &s;trange a&s;cendency over our hearts, before the early impre&s;&s;ions of love and friend&s;hip can be thoroughly effaced, &s;o as to cool our affections towards tho&s;e whom we once cordially loved.</P>
<P>I DECLARE to you, I feel in my heart &s;o many rea&s;ons for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of a brother, that it does not appear to me po&s;&s;ible to entertain any &s;entiment like aver&s;ion towards him: If I am mi&s;taken, I hope you will always be in the &s;ame error with my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="029954_0075_0FE382E40BD3B1D8">O! IF you once ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of an intimate union with each other, nothing can be equal to your &s;atisfaction: Your harve&s;ts will be crowned with peace; your property will be in a manner common; there will be only one heart, and one &s;oul, betwixt you. We de&s;pi&s;e brothers who quarrel with one another; and chicanery employs all her arts to ruin them both.</P>
<P>VIRTUE is only to be found in the regions of peace and love: Every kingdom, divided again&s;t it&s;elf, will be brought to de&s;olation. Rather give up a portion of your goods, than forfeit the ble&s;&s;ings of peace: This example was &s;et you by your father. He cho&s;e rather to recede from his ju&s;t rights&punc; than to engage in a law-&s;uit with his near relations: Such conduct is highly worthy of your imitation.</P>
<P>WE are all ready enough to bewail the di&s;mal effects of tho&s;e wars, which, for the &s;ake of an acce&s;&s;ion of territories, plunge whole nations into the depths of mi&s;ery and de&s;truc|tion. And yet for a few yards of land, we per&s;ecute each other without remor&s;e: Can there be a greater incon&s;i&s;tency than this?</P>
<P>THE world abounds with per&s;ons, who, inheriting the e&s;tates of their friends, neglect to di&s;charge the mo&s;t &s;acred duties, in order to gratify their boundle&s;s de&s;ires. The de|parted friend is no &s;ooner interred, than they &s;eize on his effects with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s, and in&s;i&s;t on the privilege of plundering his hou&s;e. Could I think you capable of &s;uch rapacity, I would rather wi&s;h that you &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing I have, while I live, than di&s;honour both your|&s;elves and me by quarrels after my death. My riches are your's; and I &s;hould really be plea&s;ed to have you make an immediate divi&s;ion of them among your&s;elves: I &s;hall want very little, for the &s;hort time I have to live.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="029954_0076_0FE382ED8305C208">THERE is &s;omething horrible in the love of money: It breaks the longe&s;t ties; it is utterly regardle&s;s of the cries of the wretched; it de&s;pi&s;es the cen&s;ures of the world; it leads us into the greate&s;t crimes. When we thir&s;t after riches, we de&s;pi&s;e virtue as a thing of nought: Even the &s;oul it&s;elf is di&s;regarded, when this pa&s;&s;ion is predominant; hence &s;o many e&s;tates indirectly obtained! Hence &s;o many in&s;tances of in|humanity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT what is a palace, however brilliant, in which there is neither peace nor virtue? It is the &s;eat of tumult and wicked|ne&s;s, in the eye of rea&s;on; how much better it is to dwell in an humble cottage, and enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of concord and tranquillity!</P>
<P>THE riches, which we acquire by di&s;hone&s;t means, are &s;eldom of a long duration.

<P>I THANK GOD, that covetou&s;ne&s;s never took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart; I always con&s;idered that vice, as the portion of a ba&s;e mind. If your &s;entiments are not &s;ordid, you will think the &s;ame: The love of your relations will appear in your eyes far preferable to all the trea&s;ures in the world; and you will never think your&s;elves truly rich, but when tho&s;e who are neare&s;t allied to you are your BEST friends. What a com|fort is it to live in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e of our own family, with|out di&s;cord, without mi&s;tru&s;t; and to be able to find, within the circle of our own relations, all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in need of! This indeed de&s;erves the name of true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT can I do more, my dear children, to in&s;pire you with the love of unity and peace; except it be to de&s;ire you

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XVIII. <HI>On</HI> RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>A DAY in my pre&s;ent weak &s;tate is too precious to be pa&s;&s;ed over by me, without employing it in di&s;cour&s;ing with you on the &s;ubject of religion; in explaining to you
<PB N="140" REF="029954_0077_0FE382F260561380">
what it is, and what are the demands which it makes upon you. I am thankful for that mea&s;ure of divine knowledge which has taught me, that nothing can equal the happine&s;s of being engaged in the &s;ervice of GOD. Be a&s;&s;ured, you will never be happy, but while you live in obedience to His laws.</P>
<P>ALL the in&s;tructions, which I have hitherto given you, would be very defective indeed, if they did not lead you to Chri&s;tianity. An hone&s;t and an amiable man are only &s;ketches of virtue: Religion mu&s;t fill up, and fini&s;h the picture.</P>
<P>I WILL not enter upon a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal kinds of religious wor&s;hip. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that we believe Chri&s;tianity to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the foundation of rea&s;on, &s;cripture, and truth; and that they, who have pre&s;umed to level their attacks again&s;t it, are &s;cattered as the du&s;t before the wind. This is a fact which hi&s;tory will &s;ufficiently atte&s;t, and of the truth of which you will be thoroughly convinced, if you read it with attention: It is only the &s;trength of our pa&s;&s;ions which blinds our &s;ight in this matter.</P>
<P>I NEVER knew a man of real virtue decry religion; men only attack its precepts and in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uctions, becau&s;e it pre&s;cribes mortification and &s;elf-denial. The libertine condemns relig|ion, only to revenge him&s;elf on it, for the re&s;traints which it lays upon him. He is like a man who, having been ca&s;t in a law-&s;uit, endeavours to defend him&s;elf, by accu&s;ing his judges of partiality and iniquity.</P>
<P>IF ever you li&s;ten to &s;uch people, and adopt their idle ob|jections to the truth, you are undone: Your hearts will &s;oon be corrupted; like the heart of that fool upon &s;acred record, who pre&s;umed to &s;ay in it, "There is no God." We begin with li&s;tening to bla&s;phemy, and we fini&s;h with uttering it our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="029954_0077_0FE382F260561380">WHEN I am tormented with frightful apprehen&s;ions on this &s;ubject, my comfort is, that you have had the ble&s;&s;ing of a Chri&s;tian education: I recall to my remembrance tho&s;e holy &s;acraments, whereby you have been initiated and &s;trength|ened; tho&s;e re&s;olutions, by which you have &s;o often engaged your&s;elves to &s;erve your GOD with fidelity. All the&s;e con&s;id|erations fill me with a confident a&s;&s;urance, that my children will continue faithful members of the church in which they were born and educated; and never di&s;honour the religion of their Saviour, by an immoral or irreligious conduct.</P>
<P>INDEED if I had any doubts in this matter, I &s;hould weep ince&s;&s;antly for you; my &s;oul would be ca&s;t down with the mo&s;t horrible inquietude: And I &s;hould be ready to cur&s;e the very day, in which I brought you into the world. I &s;hould no longer be a mother, mo&s;t tenderly attached to her children: But a wretched woman, that had give them up, to vindicate the honour of GOD. O! how infinitely are both you and my&s;elf indebted to Him! How wonderfully doth He vouch|&s;afe to comfort and &s;upport, even me, who am but du&s;t and a&s;hes. How, good heavens! can I &s;ufficiently acknowledge this great mercy!</P>
<P>IT is the Chri&s;tian religion alone, which intimately unites us with the Deity. While we walk under the direction of her light, we are in no danger of lo&s;ing our way; we find her pre&s;ent in all our nece&s;&s;ities. She never for&s;akes us in any of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es; &s;he makes us amends, for all the lo&s;&s;es we &s;u&s;|tain; &s;he attends us, even to the grave; in her bo&s;om we live, in her arms we expire.</P>
<P>RELIGION &s;anctifies our actions; and furni&s;hes the &s;oul with infinite con&s;olation, by &s;etting before it the hope of an Everla&s;ting Recompence. In what deep di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould I now be involved, if, being about to lo&s;e you, whom I love more
<PB N="142" REF="029954_0078_0FE382FB933F5A58">
dearly than my&s;elf, I had no re&s;ource in the trea&s;ures of hea|ven! A fatal de&s;pair would &s;eize upon my &s;oul; I &s;hould &s;ink into the horrors of annihilation, and &s;hould expire, full of rage and fury.</P>
<P>BUT, O my GOD, the confidence which I have, that I &s;hall &s;ee and enjoy Thee, calms my grief; and a&s;&s;ures me, that in Thee I have what is much more precious to me than the whole univer&s;e, even more than my children them&s;elves, though &s;o exceedingly dear to me.</P>
<P>THUS it is, that our holy religion flies to our &s;uccour in the mid&s;t of evils; the more afflictive they are, the more abundant are her con&s;olations. How happy will you be, if you ob&s;erve her maxims! Nothing can then render you mi&s;|erable.&mdash; You will perceive the hand of GOD in every occur|rence of your life, however trivial in appearance: You will acknowledge his wi&s;dom in every leaf that &s;hooteth, in every in&s;ect that creepeth, in every grain of du&s;t that you tread under your feet. You will know that, He is the Author of life and death; that He directs our thoughts, li&s;tens to our &s;ighs, enables us to behold and to declare the wonders of his providence.</P>
<P>HOW many days, alas! have I pa&s;&s;ed without reflecting on the&s;e truths! The world is a &s;tream, which always carries us away, far from GOD, and from our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN the eyes of the man of this world, religion is a mere engine of &s;tate policy: The profane wit treats it as a fable. But to him who li&s;tens to its dictates, and learns from it to renounce his pa&s;&s;ions, it is no other than truth it&s;elf. Con|&s;ider it as your duty to become acquainted with religion; &s;he fears nothing, except that men &s;hould be ignorant of her excellence.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="029954_0078_0FE382FB933F5A58">IN vain hath impo&s;ture painted Chri&s;tianity in the fal&s;e&s;t colours; it cannot name a &s;ingle error, which &s;he approves; or point out a &s;ingle truth, which &s;he condemns; nor can an in&s;tance be produced of any one who ever repented of being a Chri&s;tian. Self-reproach is the portion only of tho&s;e perver&s;e men, who &s;coff at religion: Scarce doth a fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;eize them, but they &s;mite upon their brea&s;ts in de&s;pair, and bewail their impiety. The moment of death, is that of truth. If religion would tolerate vice, they, who are now her bittere&s;t adver&s;aries, would repre&s;ent her as lovely and delightful, and earne&s;tly e&s;pou&s;e her cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I NEED not tell you, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e works of piety, in order to procure the character of an HON|EST man; it is &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, merely to ab&s;tain from injuring your neighbour: But hone&s;ty is always in dan|ger of being lo&s;t, when it is not &s;upported by religion. When we do not admit into our &s;y&s;tem, a Deity, who takes cogni|zance of our actions, and who will either reward or puni&s;h us; we live like brute creatures; we give the reins to our lu&s;ts in every action, which we hope will e&s;cape the eyes of men.</P>
<P>ONLY ob&s;erve tho&s;e unbelievers, who live without faith and hope; attend a little to their words and actions: Their &s;y&s;tem of morality is abominable; and if their manners are corrupt, this is only a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. The fear of man is not a &s;ufficient bridle to re&s;train us; it may &s;ometimes hinder evil actions, but it lays no re&s;traint on evil de&s;ires.</P>
<P>IRRELIGION leads to all kinds of exce&s;s: In her e&s;tima|tion, the mo&s;t horrid crimes are &s;oftened into gallantry. And the &s;oul it&s;elf, O! dreadful imagination! that &s;oul, which was created in the image of GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> only a particle of matter,

which death is about to annihilate! See to what height this new philo&s;ophy rai&s;es us! You cannot con&s;ider it without horror.</P>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible, LORD, that my mind &s;hould be filled with &s;uch exalted ideas of thy perfections, with &s;o ardent a de&s;ire of being forever united to thee; and that after all, my lot &s;hould be that of a crawling in&s;ect? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that reli|gion, the practice whereof is &s;o holy; who&s;e outward appear|ance is &s;o amiable; which has filled me with &s;o much com|fort; which in&s;pires me with &s;o much re&s;olution, in the mid&s;t of my &s;orrows and afflictions: Is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a reli|gion &s;hould be a mere illu&s;ion and chimera? Away with &s;uch deceitful dreams! My fle&s;h may decay, and my tomb open it&s;elf to receive me; but I fore&s;ee a never-ending life awaits me: And the GOD, whom I adore, will crown me with un&s;peakable joy, if I am &s;o happy as to depart this life in his fear and love.</P>
<P>O! MY dear children, this idea already fills my &s;oul with tran&s;port; methinks I already &s;ee time end, and Eternity&mdash; But &s;uffer me, a moment, to give up my whole attention to this &s;ublime &s;ubject; &s;uffer me for a while to forget the world and to think only of Heaven.&mdash;</P>
<P>HERE &s;he continued lo&s;t for &s;ome time in the depth of her reflections; but afterwards, recovering her&s;elf, &s;he re&s;umed her di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>NATURE has certainly made YOU more dear to me, than any other creature in this world: But religion is an additional tie of affection, by which you are &s;till more &s;trongly united to me. When I reflect on our alliance by con&s;anguinity, I con&s;ider you as children fa&s;hioned and formed within me, of whom death will very &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">prive me: But, by the light of

faith, I behold you as children &s;tamped with the image of GOD him&s;elf, and de&s;tined to live with me forever in the re|gions of eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;uch ideas as the&s;e, &s;o capable of rai&s;ing and comforting the &s;oul, a mother knows nothing &s;uperior to that &s;ort of fondne&s;s, which the brute creature &s;hews towards its young: Affection, which is merely earthly, is nothing more than pure in&s;tinct. Whereas religion purifies parental love, and gives it a continuance which will never have an end.</P>
<P>LEARN hence, my dear children, that your behaviour, unle&s;s you have heaven in your view, will be mean and un|worthy. Earth has not a point, on which an immortal being can re&s;t: Whatever it has to offer, mu&s;t needs peri&s;h with it; and what&s;oever peri&s;heth, is as nothing.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;oldier is thoroughly per&s;uaded of this truth, he is a thou&s;and times a better officer for it. He does not wait to be &s;een by men, in order to acquit him&s;elf with valour: he knows that he is &s;een of GOD, and that is &s;uffi|cient for him. A true Chri&s;tian is never faint-hearted, when he is doing his duty: he is per&s;uaded that religion has placed him in his po&s;t, that &s;he requires him to hazard his life for his King and Country, and he is prepared to obey her com|mands.</P>
<P>ALL my comfort, amid&s;t the ravages which infidelity is making, is, that you are of &s;uch rank, as only to a&s;&s;ociate with per&s;ons of quality. Liberal minds &s;eldom prote&s;t openly again&s;t religion; it is chiefly in the company of low per&s;ons, or tho&s;e who have had no proper education, that impious conver&s;ation prevails.</P>
<P>GOOD GOD! what plea&s;ure can a Chri&s;tian find, in ridi|culing the &s;acred truths of Chri&s;tianity? What credit can he gain, in reviling the religion of his fathers; in which he lives,
<PB N="146" REF="029954_0080_0FE383088BBF1868">
and in which he expects to die? We admire tho&s;e letters, in which the Jew, the Turk, the Per&s;ian, &s;peak of the wor|&s;hip of their re&s;pective deities, with tran&s;port and enthu&s;ia&s;tic reverence. And do WE ridicule a work, on the authority of which the Chri&s;tian's faith &s;tands &s;upported? What an in|con&s;i&s;tency! what mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>O! MY dear children; if you could look into my &s;oul, you would &s;ee how earne&s;tly I de&s;ire that you &s;hould render un|to GOD the things which are GOD'S; that you &s;hould ob&s;erve his law, re&s;pect his mini&s;ters, and not tamely &s;uffer wicked raillery to be levelled again&s;t any thing which relates to divine wor&s;hip. The lea&s;t plea&s;antry, upon &s;o &s;acred a &s;ubject, is almo&s;t always bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>WHENEVER YOU approach as near to the end of your life, as I am at this time, you will, I hope, have as lively a &s;en&s;e of that awful Deity, whom we are too apt to forget in the days of health, and in the vigour of life: his ju&s;tice on one &s;ide, and his mercy on the other, will then engage all your thoughts, and all your admiration.</P>
<P>WHENEVER you can truly &s;ay you fear nothing but GOD, you will con&s;ider the approach of my death, only as an entrance on a &s;tate of happine&s;s. A life full of crimes, and even a life that has been unprofitably &s;pent, is a dreadful object to the eyes of a Chri&s;tian, at the point of death. But ob&s;erve, that the piety, which I am at pre&s;ent recommending to you, is only &s;uch as is manly, rational and &s;olid; founded on the autho|rity of the Go&s;pel, and recommended and enforced by the Chri&s;tian church, in every age and nation, in which Chri&s;t|ianity is known. Super&s;tition never yet made a good Chri&s;t|ian. It only expo&s;es religion to contempt, to make it con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e frivolous ceremonies, which true piety di&s;claims.</P>

How meanly would you think of me, if I were &s;o regardle&s;s of your FIRST concern, as, in the&s;e my la&s;t moments, to exhort you to be careful only to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of the pre&s;ent life!

<P>A LITTLE reflection will convince you that there is noth|ing but GOD and his religion, the continuance whereof we can en&s;ure; and that every thing has an end, except the dominion of virtue. Good heavens! in what a &s;ituation &s;hould I find my&s;elf, if I had only reckoned upon this mortal life; if all my happine&s;s had centered within the circle of a few years! I &s;hould &s;ee nothing before me but annihilation, or &s;omething far more terrible.

<P>YOU are by no means left at liberty to follow the dictates of your own pa&s;&s;ions, or to walk in the paths of unbelief. The education which you have received, the advice of your father ju&s;t before his death, and my admonitions under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, make you accountable for your conduct to your country, and to all mankind. They will li&s;ten to

It is only by deba&s;ing our&s;elves to a level with the brute creation, that we lo&s;e the idea of GOD. How can we forget Him; in whom we live, and by whom we have our being?

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XIX. <HI>On the</HI> VANITY <HI>of the</HI> WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>FOR three weeks our exemplary mother had found her|&s;elf &s;omewhat better; at the end of which, her appetite failed her, all at once; this, together with her lo&s;s of &s;leep, reduced her to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of weakne&s;s imaginable. Yet &s;he wi&s;hed to have one other opportunity of conver&s;ing with her children; though the in&s;tructions which &s;he had already given them were &s;o full, as to leave hardly any thing, that was nece&s;&s;ary, un&s;aid.</P>
<P>THE extreme weakne&s;s of my pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;ays &s;he, af|fords me an occa&s;ion of &s;peaking to you on the vanity of all things in this world. Look at me with attention; &s;ee how dim my eyes appear; how emaciated my per&s;on, and what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion death has already taken of me! This was the wo|man that appeared not long ago with &s;uch eclat; that was celebrated for her amiable qualities, as well as for external accompli&s;hments. Here are the only remains of what &s;he was; a mere &s;hadow&mdash;a nothing.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ituation has rendered me much more of a philo&s;o|pher, than all the books that were ever written on the &s;ubject could have done. Alas! whil&s;t I &s;uffer, and even am dying by degrees, I have &s;een all tho&s;e objects gradually lo&s;e their value, which my imagination rai&s;ed far above their real worth. Plea&s;ures now appear to me only as mere illu&s;ions, and ho|nours as an empty vapour.&mdash;Truth &s;eems every day to take me by the hand and &s;hew me the vanity of this world, and the emptine&s;s of every thing which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="029954_0083_0FE3831BD17CF590">THE &s;ame effect is produced in me, which the autumn every year exhibits to our view: Ju&s;t as we then &s;ee the beauties of nature gradually di&s;appear, I have &s;een the gran|deur of this world dimini&s;hed; its mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions deba&s;ed, and all its ornaments &s;tript off, as leaves from the trees by the winter's bla&s;t.</P>
<P>FALSE appearances dazzle our eyes, while we enjoy per|fect health; every thing then bewitches us; every thing &s;e|duces us; every thing appears to us eternal in its duration. Scarcely hath a fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized us, but truth di&s;pels the charm, and recals us to our&s;elves; leaving us to behold noth|ing but a veil of darkne&s;s, drawn over all that heretofore ex|cited our admiration.</P>
<P>IN proportion as I draw nearer to my grave, the horizon grows darker; and tho&s;e entertainments, which once enchant|ed me, tho&s;e balls which charmed me, tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies which intoxicated my mind and my &s;en&s;es, &s;eem only phantoms, of which I have been the dupe, which, on a moment's reflection, di&s;appear.</P>

<P>WHAT folly is it, my children, to be &s;o &s;trongly attached to objects of &s;uch a tran&s;itory nature! To put one's confidence in things, which have only the appearance of good! Alas! if all the mo&s;t captivating &s;cenes in the world could be now exhibited to my view; had I now the di&s;po&s;al of crowns and trea&s;ures what advantage could I receive from them?

And, even if they were capable of producing &s;uch wonders, would they be of any continuance? Every thing here below, not excepting even life it&s;elf, is but a dream. How many great men have you &s;een pa&s;s away! Though their glo|ry appeared immortal, we now &s;carcely remember that they ever exi&s;ted. Death hath de&s;troyed not only their bodies, but their very name and their remembrance.</P>
<P>O! HOW low doth human greatne&s;s &s;ink, when the cur|tain is drawn up, and we &s;ee only the Maje&s;ty of GOD! It is nothing more than an imperceptible point, lo&s;t in the aby&s;s of immen&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="029954_0084_0FE383250FEFFC90">I HAVE lived in the &s;ociety of per&s;ons, among whom my fortune, rank, and dignity, attracted many admirers; when the vivacity of plea&s;ure intoxicated my heart, and charmed my &s;en&s;es: But all that glory is departed as a &s;hadow, and the &s;ocieties them&s;elves are &s;unk into nothing. A few years have effected this &s;trange revolution: Time is a pitile&s;s de&s;|troyer, which is daily con&s;uming every thing that is mortal, and by degrees annihilates it&s;elf.</P>
<P>O HEAVENS! what a vacancy appears before my eyes, when I review the number of per&s;ons within the circle of my own acquaintance, who are now no more; enough almo&s;t to form a world! You will very &s;oon add to the number: My &s;lender voice, my emaciated figure, my exhau&s;ted frame, all unitedly declare, that I have nothing to expect within the compa&s;s of the univer&s;e, but five or &s;ix feet of earth.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame lot awaits you all, at &s;ome little di&s;tance of time. Your youth will pa&s;s away like a ro&s;e; and, for ought we know, you are this moment on the brink of de&s;truction. The grave receives as many young per&s;ons as old: Every creature is tributary to death; he is an unrelenting creditor, who &s;uffers no one to be at re&s;t.</P>
<P>HOW &s;trangely &s;hould I have been deceived, if I had rec|koned upon three&s;core or four&s;core years! By the bla&s;t of the Almighty the bloom of my life is faded away; and I am brought to contemplate my death, in a &s;tate of ex|treme weakne&s;s; and ought I to complain of this &s;tate? I, who, like other human creatures, was born to die, and who&s;e di&s;&s;ipation and folly have de&s;erved a large portion of the cup of bitterne&s;s and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>IT is only by the tenderne&s;s of my affection that you can know me to be your mother. Sickne&s;s has &s;o entirely effaced
<PB N="156" REF="029954_0085_0FE38329AF125AA0">
every line of my per&s;on, as to render me quite a &s;tranger to my own family, and to all my attendants; they look &s;hy up|on me; they are afraid to come near me; and it is only their exceeding great affection for me, that gets the better of their unwillingne&s;s to approach me. I am very far from blaming them; for I have much ado even to remember my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is only this per&s;pective, that di&s;covers truth to us: while we &s;ee nothing but the gaudy &s;plendor of the world, we live in the mid&s;t of error and delu&s;ion. But as &s;oon as we reflect upon our frailty, we turn towards our&s;elves, and to|wards heaven; we penetrate even into the reality of things, and do not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be dazzled by appearances.</P>
<P>HOW thankful ought I to be, that death approaches me &s;o gradually, as in&s;en&s;ibly to reconcile me to it, and withdraw my attention from every &s;educing object! I pa&s;s my days in reflecting on the &s;ources of my life, which are exhau&s;ted; in reading tho&s;e books, which remind me of my latter end: for it is right that you &s;hould know, that I never &s;pare my&s;elf on this &s;ubject. Every morning I take my looking-gla&s;s, to &s;ee to what &s;tate death reduces us; and often, very often I am reminded, that my coffin is ju&s;t ready to receive me.</P>
<P>THERE it is, my children, that very &s;oon your fond moth|er, without either &s;en&s;e or motion, and without any pro&s;pect of returning to this world again, will be de&s;tined to moulder in the bo&s;om of corruption. O! fearful thought!&mdash;But I will &s;pare your tenderne&s;s on a &s;ubject too affecting for you, as well as for my&s;elf. You are not ignorant, (indeed who is?) that this di&s;mal end is the lot of all men; and that in &s;pite of the plea&s;ures, which delude them, in &s;pite of the fal&s;e glory which dazzles them, they mu&s;t fall into the depths of horror and oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="029954_0085_0FE38329AF125AA0">DREADFUL as the darkne&s;s of the tomb may appear, it has enlightened me more than the brightne&s;s of the &s;un: This only &s;hews me peri&s;hable objects, that di&s;covers to me the ex|cellence of my &s;piritual part, and the Maje&s;ty of my GOD, which before were in a manner concealed from me. By the help of the light which that imparts to me, I have gone thro' the whole world, and have di&s;covered much vanity and mi|&s;ery; I have &s;een nothing more effectually in&s;tructive than death and dying per&s;ons, burials and epitaphs.</P>
<P>SEE all that remains to me of earthly greatne&s;s: A &s;hort in&s;cription &s;erves to inform others, that we once lived, and are now no more; and even this is effaced by length of time. The marble it&s;elf decays; and the eternity of the &s;upreme Being triumphs over the nothingne&s;s of man.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid enough, I hope, my dear children, to con|vince you, that I do not wi&s;h for in&s;criptions, or magnificent titles on my tomb: I am nothing more than du&s;t, and to the &s;ame element am I returning, from which I was formed. And can dry bones reduced to du&s;t, and mouldering in cor|ruption, de&s;erve a panegyric? O! where &s;hall we &s;et bounds to our vanity, if it does not &s;ink into nothing at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of a grave!</P>
<P>I THINK you mu&s;t have opportunities enough of di&s;cover|ing, that I am too thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the vanity of the world, to wi&s;h to &s;urvive my&s;elf, in wretched prai&s;es in&s;cribed on my monument: Rather let me atone for my errors and my follies by an eternal oblivion. Heaven would arm it&s;elf again&s;t me, if I thought of decorating a mi&s;erable &s;epulchre; it would only &s;erve to perpetuate my pride beyond the limits of this pre&s;ent life, if I &s;hould attempt by improper ornaments to alter the very nature of that, which in it&s;elf is nothing but mi&s;ery and corruption.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029954_0086_0FE383312D489EF0">ALL that I require of you, my beloved friends, is to come &s;ometimes to the place of my interment; not merely to &s;hed a few tears over my cold &amp; &s;en&s;ele&s;s a&s;hes, but to recal to your minds the in&s;tructions which I have given you. That awful &s;olemnity, that mournful &s;ilence, which prevail in the neigh|bourhood of &s;epulchres, will give you lei&s;ure and inclination to meditate &s;eriou&s;ly on all that I have &s;aid to you. The repre&s;entation of death is the be&s;t &s;chool, wherein we can learn to live as we ought; to rai&s;e the &s;oul from earthly things and to fix it upon GOD.</P>
<P>PROMISE me, that you will &s;ometimes vi&s;it that in&s;truc|tive &s;pot; I invite you thither: And if you love me well enough to have your minds properly &s;tored with the precepts which I have delivered to you, you will con&s;ider me as actually pre&s;ent with you there; I &s;hall have no other method of ap|pearing to you, or conver&s;ing with you.</P>
<P>ALAS! my poor children, what a melancholy ta&s;k am I impo&s;ing on you! if the world knew it, it would be &s;illy enough to treat it with contempt: But my affection prompts me to communicate to you this u&s;eful and important &s;ecret. Leave the world to act for it&s;elf; and never li&s;ten to it in any matter, which concerns your duty. It is fond of nothing which does not contribute to its amu&s;ement; and e&s;teems nothing but what flatters its ta&s;te for vanity and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHAT an impa&s;&s;able gulph is about to interpo&s;e it&s;elf be|twixt the world and me! Yet a little while and I &s;hall nei|ther know what &s;cenes of entertainment are exhibited; nor what revolutions take place in it: Yet a very little while, and all ideas of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of months and years will be utterly lo&s;t. But that which gives me &s;ome concern is, that this &s;pot of earth on which you remain, will be lo&s;t in that im|men&s;ity
<PB N="159" REF="029954_0086_0FE383312D489EF0">
which awaits me; &s;o that I &s;hall be totally unac|quainted with your conduct or your de&s;tination. What a change mu&s;t be wrought in my exi&s;tence! What a revolu|tion in my &s;entiments! Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that an in|&s;tant &s;hould produce &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing effects? At pre&s;ent I cannot properly be &s;aid to belong either to this world or the other: I am like a traveller divided between two different ways; and death, in the twinkling of an eye, will put an end to my uncertainty. One while I feel my&s;elf reluctant; at another time I de&s;ire the &s;troke: Strange alternative! on one &s;ide, is the pro&s;pect of &s;upreme felicity; on the other, the pain of being &s;eparated from that which is mo&s;t dear to me.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not, my children, but my love for you will be con&s;idered as romantic; and indeed, I believe it ri&s;es to an uncommon height. But this at lea&s;t I am &s;ure of, that I am not mi&s;taken in the advice which I have given you: It is the language of truth; it is the voice of a dying friend that you have heard.</P>
<P>WE are continually running with eage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to a new tra|gedy: We are filled with the &s;ad &s;cenes which it pre&s;ents; and we find a degree of plea&s;ure even in the tears which it excites. Here, my children, is a &s;cene yet more affecting; we have no re&s;ource to fiction here: The chief character in this tragedy is a mother really expiring; the &s;entence is pro|nounced, and is on the very point of being executed.</P>
<P>I HAVE for &s;ome days felt my&s;elf more weak than u&s;ual, and find that life is now making its e&s;cape from this totter|ing frame; nothing indeed &s;upports me but my tenderne&s;s for you: Hitherto it has detained my fugitive &s;pirit, but at length it will be forced to yield.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="029954_0087_0FE38336C224F728">COME hither, that I may embrace you; if you have the courage to join your lips to an expiring body, and to bathe in a flood of tears. Alas! I have nothing but tears to give you; the weakne&s;s of my body and the &s;trength which yet remains, de&s;troy my powers of utterance.</P>
<P>HOW &s;ad the &s;eparation! What a mournful farewel! The tenderne&s;s of my affection reminds me of the hour in which I brought you into the world; but there is this &s;ad difference, that I this day behold you to &s;ee you no more. Support me, gracious Father, in this dreadful trial: Suffer me not to &s;ink under the burthen of maternal tenderne&s;s. I know that I ought to forget every thing for thy &s;ake; and yet my heart never cea&s;es to think of my children. Dear as they are to me, efface them for ever from my memory, if this love either it or will be imputed to me as a fault.</P>
<P>BUT, what am I &s;aying? Good GOD! thou knowe&s;t that I only love them for thy &s;ake, and that I wi&s;h them no other happine&s;s than that which ari&s;es from obedience to thy law. My only rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to live among them a few years, had it been thy gracious will, is to e&s;tabli&s;h in them the love of that which is good: This it is, which makes my &s;epara|tion from my children a thou&s;and times more painful than the approaching &s;eparation of my &s;oul from my body.

<HEAD>CONFERENCE XX. <HI>On</HI> RELATIVE DUTY.</HEAD>
<P>OUR excellent mother, having received a vi&s;it from her brother in law, and having conver&s;ed with him for half an hour, de&s;ired he would permit her to introduce her children to him: When in the language of the tendere&s;t af|fection, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>THIS, my dear Children, is the per&s;on whom henceforth you are to con&s;ider as your parent: As you are connected with him by the ties of con&s;anguinity, I be&s;eech you to attach your&s;elves to him by the obligations of inviolable friend&s;hip. The love you have for me, which is about to expire, when I &s;hall no longer exi&s;t in this world, ought to be transferred to your uncle: To his favour I recommend you; no one can give you better advice than he can.</P>
<P>THEN turning her&s;elf towards her brother, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him thus: O my dear brother, you who continually remind me of my excellent hu&s;band, and in whom I have always found &s;uch &s;entiments as one &s;o nearly related to him may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain, have pity on the&s;e children. Pity their tender age; pity their orphan &s;tate, when I &s;hall be taken from them. My days are ended; my life is but a bla&s;t, and nothing remains to me but the regret of having wretchedly mi&s;pent it.</P>
<P>O! THAT I could now be a&s;&s;ured by you that my wi&s;hes would be accompli&s;hed: What would become of the&s;e un|happy

creatures in the mid&s;t of a mo&s;t dangerous world, if they were not ble&s;t with your friend&s;hip! In them, my dear brother, recollect both their father, whom you affectionately loved, and their mother, who has no power of utterance be|yond &s;ighs and tears.</P>
<P>MY heart is inexpre&s;&s;ibly affected at this dreadful &s;epara|tion, even as it were, from my&s;elf: As I before ob&s;erved to you, it is more terrible to me than the horrors of the grave.</P>
<P>FORGIVE me, gracious LORD! Thou knowe&s;t, that even in my dreams, even in the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of devotion, even in the prayers addre&s;&s;ed to thy heavenly Maje&s;ty, the remem|brance of my family continually interpo&s;ed it&s;elf, to di&s;tract my mind: In vain have I wi&s;hed to have my whole atten|tion fixed upon Thee: In vain have I endeavoured to be|come wholly ab&s;orbed by the contemplation of Thine infinite perfections. My thoughts perpetually recur to tho&s;e objects of my love; which Thou ha&s;t given me, and art now about to &s;eparate from me.</P>
<P>ALAS! my dear children, I feel that I have much le&s;s fortitude than I appear to have: One moment's reflection on your &s;ad condition, one &s;ingle thought on the &s;ubject of our &s;eparation, overwhelms my &s;oul with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow. O! Heaven! my mind hath but too much &s;en&s;ibility at pre|&s;ent: Ere long, no vi&s;ible object will affect it. The&s;e, my dear children, are the la&s;t &s;truggles of my affection: My heart at this moment &s;eems to collect every thing that is mo&s;t tender and affectionate, in order to bid you an everla&s;t|ing farewel.</P>
<P>AT the&s;e words &s;he melted into tears, when her brother-in-law an&s;wered;</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="029954_0088_0FE3833E84AC7110">"NO, my &s;i&s;ter, GOD will not be offended with that ten|derne&s;s for which you blame your&s;elf: He is goodne&s;s it&s;elf; and the holy &s;criptures dwell particularly on the &s;ubject of his love. If your affection for your children were merely carnal and earthly, the ca&s;e were different; but your love for them is that of a Chri&s;tian parent, who is chiefly &s;olicitous for their eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>"MAKE your&s;elf as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible on their account; you entru&s;t them to my care, and I will not be regardle&s;s of their welfare.

<P>THOUGH our exemplary mother appeared to have ex|hau&s;ted her whole power of utterance in the&s;e admoni|tions to her children yet one &s;ubject remained, ari&s;ing from the care &s;he took to recommend to their kindne&s;s her family and dependents.</P>
<P>WHEN they were all together, &s;he &s;aid to her &s;ons, in a voice that could with difficulty be heard: I charge you to

be kind to the&s;e my dome&s;tics, who have always been &s;trongly attached to me.&mdash;Some of them &s;erved your father, and others have given me every proof of the mo&s;t dutiful regard. I have not forgotten them in my will; but that is not &s;uffi|cient. They have a demand on you for kindne&s;&s;es, as friends in di&s;tre&s;s; for it is in this point of view, that I would have you con&s;ider them: They are &s;prung from the &s;ame origin and are de&s;tined to the &s;ame end with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>O! HOW unrea&s;onable is that pride, which the world af|fects; and which makes us look down with contempt on per&s;ons, in every e&s;&s;ential re&s;pect, like our&s;elves!</P>
<P>NEVER forget, that we di&s;honour and deba&s;e human na|ture whenever we treat any per&s;on with di&s;dain, merely becau&s;e his external appearance is meaner than our own. Your names, when you were baptized, were entered in the &s;ame regi&s;ter with tho&s;e of the poore&s;t; and the du&s;t, to which you will one day be reduced, may a&s;&s;ure you that the &s;ame de&s;tiny of mortality awaits us all.</P>
<P>AM I not going to be mixed with the lowe&s;t and meane&s;t of my fellow-creatures? Shall I not be reduced to a level with the humble&s;t &s;lave? Thus doth death ca&s;t down the high looks of the proud.</P>
<P>YOU will indeed act agreeably to my wi&s;hes, when you treat your dome&s;tics with kindne&s;s; when you watch over their morals and take care of their health. GOD knows that even at the time, when pride and a love of the world fed my vanity, I was never altogether unmindful of them; nor ever &s;poke to them in a haughty &s;tyle: If I ever did, here they are, let them witne&s;s again&s;t me."</P>
<P>TO the&s;e words her dome&s;tics could only reply with &s;ighs and lamentations; and her children, overwhelmed with grief, with interrupted accents, &s;aid:</P>

<P>YOUR uncle will communicate to you the contents of my will. I have too good an opinion of you, to think you will di&s;approve of the legacies which I have bequeathed to the poor, and to &s;ome per&s;ons with who&s;e merit I am well ac|quainted.</P>
<P>A FEW days after this la&s;t interview, her di&s;order made &s;uch a progre&s;s, that, being at the very point of death, &s;he received a vi&s;it from her children, who, with the tendere&s;t effu&s;ions of grief, reque&s;ted her la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>THEN, ju&s;t opening her dying lips, &s;he with the utmo&s;t difficulty &s;aid:</P>
<P>"THE hand of death is upon me; your mother is no more.&mdash;May the Lord receive you under his protection! With my la&s;t breath I earne&s;tly be&s;eech him to PARDON ME, and BLESS YOU.&mdash;You now &s;ee little more of me,

<P>MY grave is opening&mdash;eternity commences&mdash;Gracious LORD, receive my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>HER eyes &s;till looked for her children, 'till &s;he expired.&mdash; Thus died this incomparable mother, the remembrance of whom religion will long pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>HER daughter &s;urvived her only a few days. But her &s;ons, not regardle&s;s of the in&s;tructions which they had receiv|ed, did honour to the memory of their parents, by lives wor|thy of their birth and their education.</P>
