</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD at fir&s;t created Man Upright, after his own Image, able to keep the Law of God perfectly, and to be &s;ufficiently happy in &s;o doing. But Man by &s;inning, lo&s;t his ability to keep the Command|ments of God, lo&s;t Communion with God, and incurred his Wrath and Cur&s;e, and ju&s;tly de&s;erved everla&s;ting Damnation: God might ju&s;tly have left all Mankind to peri&s;h in this &s;tate, without any opportunity ever to be delivered; but it plea&s;ed God of his infinite Mercy, not to &s;uffer all Mankind to lie under their de&s;erved Puni&s;hment; but (the fir&s;t way of Salvation by Works being lo&s;t, we being guilty of &s;in pa&s;t, and can make no a|mends,

nor perfectly obey for the future) God &s;ent his Son to do for us, in our room and &s;tead, what we cannot do for our &s;elves, that now the way of Salvation is by <HI>Faith,</HI> to ap|ply what he has done for us. Now as God might ju&s;tly have left all the world without any opportunity ever to be &s;aved, &s;o it plea|&s;ed him to leave the mo&s;t part of the world without the ordinary means, <HI>viz.</HI> the know|ledge of the way of Salvation, till the coming of Chri&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.19, 20. And as a token that he is the only Saviour among all Nati|ons, and he that brings Salvation into the world, &s;o after his coming (and that directly &s;o &s;oon as his coming offering up him&s;elf was fini&s;hed) not only <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but all Nations are called to believe in him, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.30. But the fir&s;t way of Salvation which Man was created to, and created with a knowledge &s;ufficient for the performance of the Condi|tions of it, being lo&s;t, and there being a <HI>New Way</HI> of Salvation come in the room of it, which is not natural, &s;o the knowledge of it is not natural, but mu&s;t be acquired, &amp; there|fore is revealed in the Go&s;pel, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21. which God at fir&s;t revealed by his Prophets, and afterwards by his Son, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1 1, 2. and is com|mitted
<PB N="3" REF="001573_0004_0FB3DB50D68EEAE8">
to writing in the holy Scriptures. But to help our ignorance of Gods Law, &s;ince the Fall, and our total Ignorance of the <HI>New Way of Salvation,</HI> God has appointed <HI>Men</HI> to be Officers in his Church, to in&s;truct us in the way of Salvation, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 4.11. which is, by Gods appointment, become a nece&s;&s;ary means, as by his help, may further appear.</P>
<P>In this Chapter we have the account of our Saviours Re&s;urrection, Appearing to his Di&s;ciples, and giving them Commi&s;&s;ion to preach the Go&s;pel, <HI>v.</HI> 15. to every Creature, <HI>per &s;ynecdochen generis,</HI> for every <HI>human Crea|ture, i.e.</HI> to all the Children of Men, &s;o far as they could, thro'-out the world; the effect whereof &s;hall be according as they <HI>receive</HI> or <HI>reject</HI> it, <HI>i. e.</HI> Salvation or Damnation: No middle way.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not at this time undertake to note every point of Doctrine and Principle of Faith that may be learned from the words, nor how far <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, but thus far this Scripture, as it does not damn a per&s;on meerly for the want of Bap|ti&s;m, &s;o neither does it promi&s;e Salvation without. It &s;eems the per&s;on that hath op|portunity, and does not u&s;e it, cannot be a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001573_0005_0FB3DB52571E55C0">But by openly &s;peaking from this Scripture, I &s;hall occa&s;ion &s;ome to read the following words with the more ob&s;ervation, &amp; therefore hold it to be my duty to endeavour to prevent their mi&s;take in the meaning of them, I &s;ay, thus much, That as God does u&s;e us as rati|onal Creatures, &s;o what he requiers us to be|lieve (whether it be matter above our Rea|&s;on or not) he upon the fir&s;t requiring it's Be|lief, gives a rational Proof by Miracles, which being confirmed, the Miracles cea&s;e. Neither &s;hall I in&s;i&s;t upon &s;hewing what that Faith is, that has the Promi&s;e of Salvation. It is not a bare a&s;&s;enting to the Truth; for that the Devils do, and more, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19. but it is a Faith, that being according to the Truth, o|perates upon the Will, and works a change in the Per&s;on in whom it is, in his <HI>Love, Hope</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> His <HI>Love</HI> is changed, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14 17 <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.21. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his <HI>Hope</HI> is not in any imaginary Innocence of his own, or good Works, or any thing but <HI>Gods free Grace, free good Will and Plea&s;ure</HI> in giving us Ju&s;tifica|tion in the alone Merits of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. He labours after all Holine&s;s of Life, not as a <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of his Salvation, but as the <HI>beginning</HI> of his Happine&s;s, as his <HI>Duty</HI> to God, as a <HI>proof</HI>

<P>Neither does the Text lead us to enquire who is the <HI>efficient Cau&s;e</HI> of &s;aving Faith, but it &s;hews us the <HI>In&s;trumental Cau&s;e,</HI> which has the promi&s;e of a ble&s;&s;ing to him that diligent|ly attends it, and which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, not only for <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but for us <HI>Gentiles,</HI> of which this pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion is an Effect, and therefore calls for our great Thankfulne&s;s</P>
<P>From what lies before us, <HI>viz.</HI> the Effect of the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, or rather the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of its being <HI>received</HI> or <HI>rejected</HI> (with Bapti&s;m, implying the other Ordinances) as we have it in our Text, a|mong&s;t other profitable things, we may learn this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE,</HEAD>
<P>That the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, and e&s;pecially the Preaching of it, is that where|in Mens Salvation and Damnation is con|cerned. A weighty! a frightful Con&s;idera|tion! which we &s;hould concern our &s;elves a|bout with joy and trembling, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2.11.</P>
<P>This Truth is vi&s;ible, needs no proof, but Improvement and &s;uitable Meditations,
<PB N="6" REF="001573_0006_0FB3DB53D74D39A8">
which it is now my endeavour, with Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance to help you to.</P>
<P>But, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> If it be enquired, <HI>Wherein are the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, things that con|cern the Salvation and Damnation of Men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. Fir&s;t,</HI> The Preaching of the Go&s;pel reveals to us his Mind &amp; Laws, who rewards with Salvation &amp; puni&s;hes with Damnation. All Law-givers make Laws to reward or puni&s;h, according to the Deed or Offence, &amp; according to the Authority of the Law-giver. A King (if he &s;ee cau&s;e, and the crime de&s;erve it) puni&s;hes with Death, and his Wrath is as Fearful, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.14. The King of Kings has it in his power to puni&s;h with Damna|tion, and he only, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.4, 5. and &s;o much the more Terrible is his <HI>Fear, P&s;al.</HI> 76.7, 12. A King gives great Rewards: The Lord re|wards an&s;werable, as he is above Kings, with &s;uch Glory, Honour and Joy, that in the lea&s;t Saint &s;hall &s;urpa&s;s all the Glory of all the Kings on Earth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25. not for any de|&s;erving of ours (for he needs not to thank us) but of his meer Grace. But the nature of a Crime or Offence again&s;t God de&s;erves no le&s;s than Damnation. Ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict it except it be taken off by Chri&s;t. That done
<PB N="7" REF="001573_0006_0FB3DB53D74D39A8">
again&s;t the King may de&s;erve <HI>Death,</HI> which again&s;t a mean Man would be a &s;mall offence. Con&s;ider the Maje&s;ty of him who&s;e Law is broke, and he de&s;pi&s;ed who made the Law, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.16. Con&s;ider the dreadful aggre|vation of evil, in preferring a &s;mall Plea&s;ure before God and his Authority, and Love! Zech. 11.13. <HI>A goodly price that I was valu|ed at by them.</HI> Con&s;ider his pure and infinite Holine&s;s, Hab. 1.13. <HI>Of purer Eyes than to be|hold evil.</HI> Con&s;ider his dreadful Threatning to every breach of his Law, Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cur&s;|ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</HI> which Cur&s;e is to hell, <HI>Mar.</HI> 25.41. and no wonder when the Authority of God is de|&s;pi&s;ed; If there be one thing that a Per&s;on does not continue to do, if at one time in one thing he tran&s;gre&s;s the Law, he is under the Cur&s;e, and this Cur&s;e all lie under that are not re|lea&s;ed by Chri&s;t applyed by Faith. About the&s;e things the Go&s;pel reveals Gods mind to us, and therefore concerns our Salvation or Damnation.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The whole concernment of the Go&s;|pel and it's Ordinances, is about Mens Salva|tion and Damnation, which is therefore con|cerned in it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0">3dly, It is (e&s;pecially the Preaching of the Go&s;pel) nece&s;&s;ary in order to e&s;cape from the Wrath of God, due to us for Sin, (we are all till delivered) under Gods Wrath and Cur&s;e which nece&s;&s;arily brings Damnation, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3 <HI>And were by nature the Children of Wrath, even as others.</HI> Rom. 3.19. <HI>That every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the World become guilty before God.</HI> It is Chri&s;t that Redeemed us from the Cur&s;e, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. It is by Faith that we come to Chri&s;t, this Faith cometh by hearing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.13.14. <HI>All that call on the name of the Lord, &s;hall be &s;aved, but how &s;hall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how &s;hall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her?</HI> vers. 17. <HI>So then Faith cometh by hearing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This plainly &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of a Prea|cher, in order to Salvation. But to under|&s;tand this, con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Man has nece&s;&s;ity of a Revelation of more then he can know without (&s;ince the fall) in order to Salvation, as has been &s;hewed, &s;ee al&s;o <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, God does not want Men as In&s;tru|ments, nor the help of any outward means
<PB N="9" REF="001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0">
to make known to us the way of Salvation; He can, if he plea&s;e, reveal him&s;elf and his Son (whom it is eternal Life to know, <HI>John</HI> 17.3.) without the u&s;e of any means, to one that never heard of his Name; but if he has not promi&s;ed it (as he has not) then it is Pre&s;umption, and not Faith) to believe he will, e&s;pecially &s;eeing he &s;ays, it is his <HI>Plea|&s;ure</HI> (Mark, not his <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> but his <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI>) by as <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> a thing as Men count Preaching (and as fooli&s;h a thing, as uncapable a thing as it is in it &s;elf) to &s;ave them that believe, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21 And he that will venture his Soul, and the Souls of his Children upon a meer per&s;umption, believing what God has rather &s;aid he will not do, than that he will do it, mu&s;t fare according to his works, and have his reward where he got his Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, It is not the virtue or powerfulne&s;s of the Man, nor his Arguments, that makes the Word Preached effectual to conver&s;ion or edification, but it is meerly the ble&s;&s;ing of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.6. So it is God and his Pow|er that gives the effect, and the outward means is to be u&s;ed only becau&s;e of his Ap|pointment and In&s;titution, becau&s;e it is his plea&s;ure; As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> lift up his Rod to work
<PB N="10" REF="001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0">
the Wonders in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and divided the Sea. Had not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> obeyed and u&s;ed the &s;ign, it had not been done; yet what virtue had <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> Rod to do it? So it is the In&s;titution of God, not the Virtue, Wi&s;dom or Grace of the Man [the Preacher] that cau&s;es the Ble&s;&s;ing. And therefore our Saviour bid the People hear the Phrai&s;ees, and do their words becau&s;e of their Office, &s;itting in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Seat, and teaching Truth. And this, by the way, may &s;erve to &s;olve the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it be duty to hear a Wicked Man, while he holds the Office of a Minister, and teaches Truth?</HI> The Prie&s;t, in our Saviours time was a Wicked Man, and yet our Saviour owned him in his Office, and &s;ent the Man healed of the Le|pro&s;ie to him. The Sons of <HI>Ely</HI> were &s;can|dalou&s;ly Wicked, and yet God owned them in the holie&s;t part of their Office, <HI>i. e.</HI> to carry the Ark, which if another Man touched, he pre&s;ently dyed; though God puni&s;hed their wickedne&s;s, as he had threatned before, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.34. It is another Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether a Wicked Man, that is found to be &s;o, &s;hould be continued in the Ministry?</HI> For certainly he ought to be turned out by tho&s;e that have power to do it. But while he &s;tands in his
<PB N="11" REF="001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0">
place, he ought to be heard, provided he teach the Truth; For fal&s;e Doctrine is the Souls Poy&s;on, and ought not to be heard (at lea&s;t not in a way of Wor&s;hip) St. <HI>Paul</HI> re|joyces when the Go&s;pel is taught, though by Wicked Men out of Envy; but prays for a cur&s;e upon him that teacheth fal&s;e Doctrine, though it be him&s;elf, or an Angel from Hea|ven, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.8. <HI>Phi.</HI> 1.15.18.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, No Man has power of him&s;elf (con|&s;idered as a wi&s;e man, a learned man, and a good man) to &s;peak any thing to Edificati|on, but as God who knows the hearts and &s;tate of all Men, does by his holy Spirit guide, direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. Which we are to &s;eek, pray and wait for in the way of diligent &s;tudy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But in this, &s;o well as the former, it is to be allowed, that &s;tudy has a proper Tenden|cy, and publick Preaching &amp; private Reading and Di&s;cour&s;e, have a proper Tendency to per&s;wade to duty, and convince of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is Gods In&s;titution that makes it Warrantable to u&s;e them and in that they are like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Rod.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The perver&s;ne&s;s of mans Nature is, &s;uch, that this Tendency will not be effectual,
<PB N="12" REF="001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8">
except Gods Grace incline the heart, and give the ble&s;&s;ing, as to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Rod.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, When men are per&s;waded, it is yet a further work of Gods Mercy. Grace that works a Change in the heart unto Conver|&s;ion and Edification, which he ever gives to an obedient &s;eeking in his way, as he gave the wonders to be wrought upon <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> his obedience in lifting up his Rod, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus far at pre&s;ent concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of the Go&s;pel preached in order to Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, The Go&s;pel preached, and its Or|dinances admini&s;tred, have always influence upon the Souls of the hearers or receivers, bringing them nearer to Salvation or to Damnation, increa&s;ing the one or the other, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.16. <HI>To the one we are a &s;avour of Death unto Death, and to the other a &s;avour of Life unto Life,</HI> I&s;a. 55.10. Our Food always does us either good or harm.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, There were no occa&s;ion of the Or|dinances of the Go&s;pel, were it not in order to our &s;tate in the next world.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, if it be enquired, <HI>How the Salvation &amp; Damnation of men is concern|ed in the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1st, In re&s;pect of <HI>What</HI> is preached, and the manner of it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8">2dly, In re&s;pect of what <HI>Improvement</HI> is made of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is intended in the Text. The <HI>first</HI> has relation to it.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first,</HI> in re&s;pect to <HI>What</HI> is taught. 1&s;t. In re&s;pect to the Truth or Fal&s;hood of it, our Souls are concerned. 2dly. In re&s;pect to the Nature of it, whether it be of great concernment to be taught, or not? And al&s;o, Whether it be that wherein the Souls of the hearers are much concerned, or not? For there may be many things true, which will not do the hearers much good or harm; and &s;ome things will do more good than others, and to &s;ome per&s;ons more than to others, <HI>I</HI> mean, they have &s;uch a tendency, and &s;ome things are as life to the Soul, when applyed, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.63, 68. Thus our Souls are concerned, not only in the truth or fal&s;hood of what is taught, but al&s;o in the Profitable|ne&s;s and U&s;efulne&s;s of it. This &s;eems to be partly intended, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, In re&s;pect to the <HI>Manner</HI> of Teach|ing, it has a tendency to be more or le&s;s pro|fitable, as the Method, Arguments, Expre&s;|&s;ions, Fervency, Voice, Ge&s;ture, and Exam|ples of the Teacher, and al&s;o, the evidence
<PB N="14" REF="001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8">
of a Sence of the Needfulne&s;s and weight of the Doctrine, &amp; an affection to do his hearers good: The&s;e things &s;hould be diligently &s;triven for, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. <HI>Study to &s;hew thy &s;elf approved unto God, a Work-man, that needeth not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI> But the latter of the&s;e things (e&s;pecially) is out of the power of Man, and depends purely upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and grace of the holy Spirit (<HI>I</HI> mean, to be affected) and he gives and with-draws as he plea&s;eth, and that &s;ome times in Mercy, and &s;omtimes in Judgment; &s;ometimes for encouragement and edification, and &s;ometimes for cha&s;tize|ment, and that to the Hearers, or to the Preacher, or both; therefore both ought to labour, watch, pray, &s;trive, and to the ut|termo&s;t improve the Grace given.</P>
<P>But if any ask, <HI>Why is all this needful, &s;ee|ing it is not the power or virtue of the Man, or his Arguments, but the Grace of God that gives the Succe&s;s?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1&s;t, Becau&s;e it is the plea&s;ure of God to require Means, as the Condition of his Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o the &s;uitabler the Means are, the more they have of the nature of Means in them, and it comes the nearer to the In|&s;titution.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8">2dly, God delights to give his Grace to the diligent &s;eeker, but has promi&s;ed nothing to the idle per&s;on. But God does not tye his ble&s;&s;ing wholly to the &s;trength of Means, but &s;ometimes encourages humble diligent En|deavours with a ble&s;&s;ing upon weak Means, and &s;ometimes he cha&s;tens or puni&s;hes Negli|gence or carnal Confidence, by denying a ble&s;&s;ing upon &s;trong Means.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o &s;pecial Influence upon the Salvation and Damnation of men, by the Examples of others, e&s;pecially of the Mini|&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and that e&s;pecially in Ig|norant per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> With re&s;pect to what Improve|ment is made of the Ordinances of the Go&s;|pel by the hearers, their Salvation or Dam|nation is concerned, and herein mo&s;t of all, provided Go&s;pel Truth be taught; and up|on this lies the &s;tre&s;s of our Text.</P>
<P>He that has plain whol&s;om Food may live by feeding upon it, when he that has the be&s;t Food in the world, will &s;tarve, if he do not u&s;e it.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters Work is to teach whol&s;om Doctrine, &s;uch as his hearers need, and ap|ply it as Food or Phy&s;ick, according to the
<PB N="16" REF="001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158">
need, and if he neglect, the Soul of the hearer dyes, and his <HI>Blood is required at the neglect|ers hands,</HI> Ezek. 33.8.</P>
<P>But if the Mini&s;ter do never &s;o well, it yet depends upon the <HI>Improvement</HI> made by the hearer. Many of our Saviours hearers did not profit; and of &s;uch we read, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58.5. <HI>who will not hearken to the Voice of the Charmers charming never &s;o wi&s;ely;</HI> and our Text tells us of &s;uch, that they &s;hall be <HI>Damned.</HI> But &s;ome think they believe, and are free becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ent to the Truth, <HI>and &s;o does the Devil;</HI> but 1 Joh. 3.3. <HI>he that hath this Hope purifieth him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t endeavour to cut off an ignorant Delu&s;ion which undoes Thou&s;ands. Becau&s;e we have all Imperfections and In|firmities in this World, many excu&s;e them|&s;elves from nece&s;&s;ary and practicable Duty, under the notion of not being perfect. Say thy, <HI>That was a good Sermon, could I practi&s;e but the half of it, I &s;hould be happy.</HI> Says another, <HI>Our Mini&s;ter preaches excellent well, he that does practi&s;e one quarter of it well, needs not fear,</HI> or <HI>it is well with him.</HI></P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e, I mu&s;t teach you to di|&s;tingui&s;h. There are &s;ome things belong|ing
<PB N="17" REF="001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158">
to the Law which we mu&s;t diligently endeavour to do, and &s;trive after, or we cannot be &s;aved: There are things that we mu&s;t do in part, and he that does heartily &s;trive to do them, and does really perform in part, and follow after a greater mea&s;ure, is forgiven, and accepted in Chri&s;t.

<P>Obj. <HI>But if it be God only that gives the Increa&s;e, to what purpo&s;e &s;hall we strive?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> God does not give the Increa&s;e without us, but within us, and in and upon our &s;triving, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 26.12. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.12, 13. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling.

If there be need for the Mi|ni&s;ter to preach, there is need for you to hear and practi&s;e; for that is all the u&s;e of Preaching. And we &s;ee in our Text, that the Mini&s;ters are commanded to preach, and in this ca&s;e we are told, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.16. <HI>No man having lighten a Candle puteth it under a Ve&s;&s;el, &amp;c.</HI> Therefore it is as much a &s;in for you to neglect to hear or practi&s;e, as for the Mini&s;ter to neglect to preach.</P>
<P>Again, Mens being Saved or Damned does al&s;o much depend upon the manner of the hearers attendance, 1st, According to what our Expectation is. If we expect E|dification,

<P>Here is too little &s;aid, but I mu&s;t leave room for the <HI>Application,</HI> by way of Information.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>First,</HEAD>
<P>Is it &s;o, that the Go&s;pel preached, and its Ordinances, concern Mens Salvation and Damnation? Then &s;urely the choice&s;t, the able&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of the Children of Men &s;hould be the Mini&s;ters of it. We u&s;e to take the capable&s;t men for the mo&s;t difficult and dangerous Work. It is too great a work to be tru&s;ted in the hands of an unskil|ful per&s;on. As God is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of Mens Abilities and Means, &s;o a part of
<PB N="24" REF="001573_0015_0FB3DB61571F72E8">
the nature of the Means con&s;i&s;ts in the Ability of the In&s;trument. It is &s;urely the greate&s;t Work that ever Man was imploy'd in; and &s;urely no man need account him&s;elf too great to be imployed in it; for it con|cerns the very end of our being, and the One Thing needful; and who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 16.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Secondly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Salvation and Damnation of Men concerned in the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel? Then it is not a Work to be undertaken with a light Frame of Spirit. Who that is &s;en&s;i|ble of it, can undertake it, but with Fear and Trembling. This and that Man and Woman is like to be Saved or Damned, ac|cording to your Faithfulne&s;s or Unfaithful|ne&s;s, Prudence or Imprudence in the Work of the Go&s;pel. He that hears, to be in&s;tru|cted, has cau&s;e to Tremble, becau&s;e his own Soul is concerned; &s;urely then he that teaches, becau&s;e many Souls are concerned, &s;eeing al&s;o, the Blood of tho&s;e that peri&s;h by his neglect, &s;hall be required at his hands. He that has not an awful Sen&s;e of this, is not fit for &s;o &s;acred a Work. This may &s;erve for a lively Motive to pray to God for
<PB N="25" REF="001573_0015_0FB3DB61571F72E8">
Grace, Pre&s;ervation, Faithfulne&s;s and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance in &s;o weighty a Work.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Thirdly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel &s;o awful a Work? Then the Mini&s;ters of it ought to be freed from all other Cares and Incumbran|ces, that they may have no hindrance in attending that Work, which cannot be too well managed, and is enough to imploy the head and heart, and all the &s;trength of the be&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t and able&s;t Man on earth. It is very di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and a woful wrong to the Souls of the hearers, if the Mini&s;ter, through Nece&s;&s;ity, or Worldline&s;s, or Idle|ne&s;s, or any other hindrance, be prevented from making the Work of the Mini&s;try his whole Imployment, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2, 4, <HI>No Man that warreth, entangleth him&s;elf with the affairs of this life,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4, 15, 16, <HI>Me|ditate on the&s;e things, give thy &s;elf Wholly to them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>In doing this thou &s;halt &s;ave thy &s;elf, and them that hear thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> But &s;eeing no man is able to &s;peak a word in &s;ea&s;on, nor think a thought of him&s;elf, to Edification, but as it is given him by the Spirit, What needs all this devoting a man wholly to that Work, when by all
<PB N="26" REF="001573_0016_0FB3DB6328E2FAE0">
his &s;tudy he can have no more than what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> given him?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No more can we work in our &s;elves Faith or any Grace; but God makes our &s;triving the Condition of his giving, yea, and the in&s;trumental cau&s;e of it too, in many things. We eat to live, but God gives us Life and Nouri&s;hment by our Food, which if he deny, we langui&s;h and dye. And &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is diligent &s;tudy; &s;ee al&s;o <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 127. <HI>Except the Lord build the Hou&s;e, the Work-Man labours in vain.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. <HI>It is &s;aid, Take no thought what ye &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> &amp;c. Luke 12.11.</P>

meaning of the letter, and think it a &s;inful pre&s;umption to take it in the proper litteral &s;en&s;e, and forbear labour; which is yet &s;poke in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with the former. But other Scriptures require a dutiful Indu&s;try in both, and to tru&s;t in God for his ble&s;&s;ing thereon. We are not to look that God will give us without Means, where he has given Means to be u&s;ed, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 12.10. <HI>The Prea|cher &s;ought to find out acceptable words.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fourthly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Preaching of the Go&s;pel of &s;o great Concernment? Then it is a Work too &s;acred for Men to undertake for a <HI>Livelihood,</HI> as their Motive, or for the &s;ake of Riches or Honour, if the&s;e are to be gotten by it, as they &s;eldom are, but on the other hand Re|proach and Trouble in this world. Shall a man make this World his Aim, when there is &s;o great a Mark as the Salvation of Souls? He that does it is not likely to obtain any thing higher for his pains. He is not fit for the Mini&s;try who does not make the great end of it his very Motive, <HI>Not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Why then must Mini&s;ters be main|tained,
<PB N="28" REF="001573_0017_0FB3DB6519412238">
and have their Livelihood for their Labour?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Not properly as their Reward, but that they may be able to attend the Mini|&s;try without worldly Cumberment, which otherwi&s;e cannot be, without a Miracle; and we are not to look for Miracles, where God has given Means, and this Means God has commanded, and expects it of the Peo|ple, as an <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> to him&s;elf; and it is for the Peoples good, with re&s;pect to the great Reward which follows, as may be plentifully &s;hewed from Scripture.</P>
<P>Again, the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, as it is too &s;acred a Work to be undertaken for the honour of this world, &s;o it is too &s;acred to be varni&s;hed with excellent words of mans Wi&s;dom, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. As God has ap|pointed proper Means, &s;o natural parts, and acquired parts by Learning have their proper tendency to help men in Invention, Rea&s;on and Utterance; but he that &s;trives to &s;hew it when he is acting in that which concerns mens eternal E&s;tate, &s;eems to have forgot the worth of mens Souls, or the dread of the Danger would drive &s;uch &s;mall things out of his mind: Surely he that does &s;o, is
<PB N="29" REF="001573_0017_0FB3DB6519412238">
not &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of his Work, and is &s;o far unfit for it, and &s;eems to have forgot that he is to preach Chri&s;t, and not him&s;elf, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4, 5, it is a grievous prophain|ing of Gods Ordinance. Parts and Learn|ing are of great u&s;e, but we mu&s;t not be fed with the Di&s;h in which our Food is brought to us. Religion is of too excellent a nature in it &s;elf, to be made more beauti|ful by Mans Wi&s;dom. A Tow Lace will not become a Silk Garment; it may be of u&s;e to &s;pin and weave the Silk, but &s;poils it if it be mixed with it. It &s;hows an Ig|norance of the excellency of Religion, when Men think to beautifie it &s;o. And the ears of the hearers being tickled with fine words, has a tendency to divert their Mind from the &s;en&s;e of the weight of the Truth which they hear. Let plain intelligible &s;ignificant words be u&s;ed in Religion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fifthly,</HEAD>
<P>Is Mens Salvation or Damnation concern|ed in the Preaching of the Go&s;pel? Then we have need, for our Souls &s;ake, to avoid all &s;uch things as hinder the Succe&s;s of it; for if it prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, it may co&s;t you
<PB N="30" REF="001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48">
your Soul! Therefore let all <HI>Worldly Re|creations, vi&s;its and di&s;cour&s;es</HI> be avoided when we go to, but e&s;pecially when we go from hearing the Word Preached, while it is fre&s;h upon our mind, which is the only time to make a &s;en&s;ible application of it. We eat our food vi&s;ibly, we dige&s;t it invi&s;ibly, if both be not done we cannot live; &s;o we learn for our edification openly and publick|ly; we really get the good of it privately and &s;ecretly. Our Food is dige&s;ted by the working of nature, Our &s;piritual Food by the working of our Minds, which mu&s;t take time, and our mind cannot do it while di|verted by other things. The Bea&s;ts which did not chew the Cud after they had eaten it, were accounted unclean. And the Per&s;on that only hears, and makes no further appli|cation, is Unclean in the &s;ight of God. Our Food begins to dige&s;t &s;o &s;oon as it is eaten, or not at all; and experience &s;hews that many a Per&s;on coming from a Sermon much affected or awakened, but not improving it, pre&s;ently has by the next day lo&s;t all the &s;en&s;e of it, or at lea&s;t &s;o much that he remains as he was before. Thus Men <HI>quench</HI> and <HI>grieve</HI> the Spirit, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.30. and &s;o
<PB N="31" REF="001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48">
many loo&s;e their Salvatian, not having the like return upon them again. Thus many do the work of the Devil to their near Friends by entertaining them with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es after a Sermon which quite puts out that &s;park of eternal life, that began to kindle in them, and &s;o occa&s;ion their Damnation. It was not for nothing that God appointed the weekly day of his publick Wor&s;hip to be kept <HI>Holy</HI> from all &s;ecular Imployments. Application mu&s;t be made that very Day. If our Salvati|on be in&s;trumentally procured by the preach|ing of the Word, and if Damnation comes by the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of it, then that which makes it un&s;ucce&s;sful, is in that re&s;pect the wor&s;t of Evils. Other Sins are Pardoned when the Sinner Repents and is Converted, but <HI>This</HI> hinders Repentance and Conver&s;ion. <HI>The end</HI> of Religion is <HI>lost</HI> where the Word is un&s;ucce&s;sful. No wonder then if the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> fall upon that Land where &s;uch things are a cu&s;tom, as hinder the &s;ucce&s;s of it. But that the falling upon unnece&s;&s;ary worldly Di&s;cour&s;e &s;oon after Sermon, or in|deed any time the &s;ame day, has this woful effect; is dreadfully proved from matter of Fact. But becau&s;e it is that which works

And the Ble&s;&s;ing is promi&s;ed only upon Condition of fervent Prayer.</P>
