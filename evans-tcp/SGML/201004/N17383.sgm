<P>THE &s;pirit of virtue and morality which breathes in this ancient piece of Ea&s;tern in&s;truction,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning the fir&s;t Part, which was publi&s;hed &s;ome time before the &s;econd appeared.</NOTE> its force and conci&s;ene&s;s, and the hopes that it may do good, have prevailed with the per&s;on to whom it was &s;ent, to communicate to the Public what was tran&s;|lated only for his particular amu&s;ement. There are &s;ome rea&s;ons, which at pre&s;ent make it proper to conceal, not only his own name, but the name of his corre&s;pondent, who has now re&s;ided in China &s;everal years, and been engaged in a bu&s;ine&s;s very different from that of collecting literary curio&s;ities. The&s;e rea&s;ons will not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long; and as he &s;eems to intimate a de&s;ign, on his return to England, of publi&s;hing an entire tran&s;lation of Cao-T&s;ou's whole journey, the Public will then, in all probability, have an opportunity of being &s;atisfied concerning any particulars which they may be curious to know.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PEKING,
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 12, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the la&s;t letter which I had the honor of writing to your Lord|&s;hip, dated December <HI>23, 1748,</HI> I think I concluded all I had to &s;ay in regard to the topography and natural hi&s;tory of this great empire. I purpo&s;ed in this, and &s;ome &s;ucceeding ones, to have &s;et down &s;uch ob&s;ervations as I have been able to make on the laws, go|vernment, religion, and manners of the people. But a remarkable occurrence has happened lately, which engro&s;&s;es the conver&s;ation of the literati here, and may hereafter, perhaps, afford matter of &s;pe|culation to the learned in Europe. As it is of a nature which I know will furni&s;h &s;ome entertainment to your Lord&s;hip, I will endeavour to give you as di&s;tinct and particular an account of it as I have been able to obtain.</P>
<P>Adjoining to China on the we&s;t, is the large country of Thibet, called by &s;ome Barantola. In a province of this country, named La&s;a, re&s;ides the Grand Lama, or High Prie&s;t of the&s;e idolaters; who is reverenced, and even adored as a God, by mo&s;t of the neigh|bouring nations. The high opinion which is entertained of his &s;acred character, induces prodigious numbers of religious people to re&s;ort to La&s;a, to pay their homage to him, and to give him pre&s;ents, in order to receive his ble&s;&s;ing. His re&s;idence is in a mo&s;t magnificent pagod, or temple, built on the top of the mountain Poutala. The foot of this mountain, and even the whole di&s;trict of La&s;a, is inhabited by an incredible number of Lamas of different ranks and orders; &s;everal of whom have very grand pagods erected to their honor, in which they receive a kind of inferior wor&s;hip. The whole country, like Italy, abounds with prie&s;ts; and they entirely &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the great number of rich pre&s;ents which are &s;ent them from the utmo&s;t extent of Tartary, from the empire of the Great Mogul, and from almo&s;t all parts of the Indies. When the Grand Lama receives the adora|tions of the people, he is rai&s;ed on a magnificent altar, and &s;its cro&s;s-legged upon a &s;plendid cu&s;hion. His wor&s;hippers pro&s;trate them&s;elves before him, in the humble&s;t and mo&s;t abject manner; but he returns not the lea&s;t &s;ign of re&s;pect, nor ever &s;peaks even to the greate&s;t princes. He only lays his hand upon their heads, and they are fully per&s;uaded that they receive from thence a full for|givene&s;s of all their &s;ins. They are likewi&s;e &s;o extravagant as to
<PB N="x" REF="022469_0008_0FB92099502FF778">
imagine, that he knows all things, even the &s;ecrets of the heart; and his particular di&s;ciples, being a &s;elect number of about two hundred of the mo&s;t eminent Lamas, have the addre&s;s to make the people be|lieve he is immortal; and that, whenever he appears to die, he only changes his abode, and animates a new body.</P>
<P>The learned in China have long been of opinion, that, in the ar|chieves of this grand temple, &s;ome very ancient books have for many ages been concealed; and the pre&s;ent Emperor, who is very curious in &s;earching after the writings of antiquity, became at length &s;o fully convinced of the probability of this opinion, that he determined to try whether any di&s;covery of this &s;ort could be made. To this end, his fir&s;t care was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> find out a per&s;on eminently &s;kilful in the ancient languages and characters. He at length pitched upon one of the Haulins, or doctors of the fir&s;t order, who&s;e name was Cao-T&s;ou; a man about fifty years of age, of a grave and noble a&s;pect, of great eloquence, and who, by an accidental friend&s;hip with a certain learned Lama, who had re&s;ided many years at Peking, was become entirely ma&s;ter of the language which the Lamas of Thibet u&s;e among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>With the&s;e qualifications be &s;et forward on his journey; and, to give his commi&s;&s;ion the greater weight, the Emperor honoured him with the title of <HI>COLAO,</HI> or Prime-mini&s;ter: To which he added a mo&s;t magnificent equipage and attendants, with pre&s;ents for the Grand Lama, and the other principal Lamas, of an immen&s;e value; al&s;o a letter, written with his own hand, in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>TO THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF GOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t High, Mo&s;t Holy, and worthy to be adored!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the EMPEROR of CHINA, Sovereign of all the &s;overeigns of the earth, in the per&s;on of this our mo&s;t re|&s;pected prime mini&s;ter, CAO-TSOU, with all reverence and humility, pro&s;trate our&s;elf beneath thy &s;acred feet, and im|plore, for our&s;elf, our friends, and our empire, thy mo&s;t powerful and gracious benediction.</P>

<PB N="xi" REF="022469_0009_0FB9209A59BE6888">
books, which, from their great antiquity, are become to the generality, even of the learned, almo&s;t wholly unintelligible; in order, as far as in us lies, to prevent their being totally lo&s;t, we have thought proper to authori&s;e and employ our mo&s;t learned and re&s;pected mini&s;ter, Cao-T&s;ou, in this our pre&s;ent emba&s;&s;y to thy Sublime Holine&s;s. The bu&s;ine&s;s of which is, to de&s;ire, that he may be permitted to read and examine the &s;aid writings&mdash;we expecting, from his great and uncommon &s;kill in the ancient languages, that he will be able to interpret whatever may be found, though of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;cure antiquity. And we have commanded him to throw him&s;elf at thy feet, with &s;uch te&s;timonies of our re&s;pect, as, we tru&s;t, will procure him the admittance we de&s;ire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I will not detain your Lord&s;hip with any particulars of his journey, though he hath publi&s;hed a large account of it, abounding with many &s;urpri&s;ing relations, and which, at my return to England, I may probably tran&s;late and publi&s;h entire. Let it &s;uffice at pre&s;ent, that, when he arrived in the&s;e &s;acred territories, the magnificence of his appearance, and the richne&s;s of his pre&s;ents, failed not to gain him a ready admi&s;&s;ion. He had apartments appointed him in the &s;acred college, and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his enquiries by one of the mo&s;t learned Lamas. He continued there near &s;ix months: during which time, he had the &s;atisfaction of finding many valuable pieces of antiquity; from &s;ome of which he hath made very curious extracts, and hath formed &s;uch probable conjectures concerning their authors, and the times wherein they were written, as proves him to be a man of great judgment and penetration, as well as mo&s;t exten&s;ive reading.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t ancient piece he hath di&s;covered, and which none of the Lamas for many ages had been able to interpret or under&s;tand, is a &s;mall &s;y&s;tem of morality, written in the language and character of the ancient Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts or Bramins; but by what particular per&s;on, or in what time, he does not pretend to determine. This piece, how|ever, he wholly tran&s;lated, though, as he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, with an utter incapacity of reaching, in the Chine&s;e language, the &s;trength and &s;ublimity of the original. The judgments and opinions of the bonzes and the learned doctors, are every much divided concerning it. Tho&s;e who admire it the mo&s;t highly, are very fond of attributing it to Confucius, their own great philo&s;opher; and get over the difficulty of its being written in the language and character of the ancient Bramins, by &s;uppo&s;ing this to be only a tran&s;lation, and that the original work of Confucius is lo&s;t. Some will have it to be the in|&s;titutes of Laokinn, another Chine&s;e philo&s;opher, cotemporary with Confucius, and founder of the &s;ect Tao-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but the&s;e labour under
<PB N="xii" REF="022469_0010_0FB9209BD3E790D8">
the &s;ame difficulty, in regard to the language, with tho&s;e who attri|bute it to Confucius. There are others, who, from &s;ome particular marks and &s;entiments which they find in it, &s;uppo&s;e it to be written by the Bramin Dandamis, who&s;e famous letter to Alexander the Great, is recorded by the European writers. With the&s;e Cao-T&s;ou him&s;elf &s;eems mo&s;t inclined to agree; at lea&s;t &s;o far as to think, that it is really the work of &s;ome ancient Bramin; being fully per&s;uaded, from the &s;pirit with which it is written, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it is no tran&s;lation. One thing, however, occa&s;ions &s;ome doubt among&s;t them; and that is, the plan of it; which is entirely new to the Ea&s;tern people, and &s;o unlike any thing they have ever &s;een, that, if it was not for &s;ome turns of expre&s;&s;ion peculiar to the Ea&s;t, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of accounting for its being written in this very ancient language, many would &s;uppo&s;e it to be the work of an European.</P>
<P>But whoever was the writer of it, the great noi&s;e which it makes in this city, and all over the empire, the eagerne&s;s with which it is read by all kinds of people, and the high encomiums which are given to it by &s;ome, at length determined me to attempt a tran&s;lation of it into Engli&s;h; e&s;pecially as I was per&s;uaded it would be an agreeable pre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hip. And I was the more ea&s;ily induced to make this trial, as, very happily for me, you cannot judge how far I have fallen &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt of the original, or even of the Chine&s;e tran&s;lation. One thing, however, it may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for, at lea&s;t to give &s;ome account of; and that is, the &s;tyle and manner in which I have tran&s;lated it. I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that when I fir&s;t &s;at down to the work, I had not the lea&s;t intention of doing it in this way; but the &s;ublime manner of thinking which appeared in the Introduction, the great energy of expre&s;&s;ion and the &s;hortne&s;s of the &s;entences, naturally led me into this kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. And I hope the having &s;o elegant a pattern to form my&s;elf upon, is our ver&s;ion of the book of Job, the P&s;alms, the works of Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, and the Prophets, hath been of &s;ome advantage to my tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>Such as it is, if it affords your Lord&s;hip any entertainment. I &s;hall think my&s;elf extremely happy; and, in my next, will re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e my account of this people, and their empire.</P>

<P>BOW down your heads unto the du&s;t, O ye Inhabitants of earth! Be &s;ilent; and receive, with reverence, in&s;truction from on high.</P>
<P>Where&s;oever the &s;un doth &s;hine; where&s;oever the wind doth blow; where&s;oever there is an ear to hear, and a mind to con|ceive; there let the precepts of life be made known, let the maxims of truth be honored and obeyed.</P>
<P>All things proceed from God. His power is unbounded, his wi&s;dom is from eternity, and his goodne&s;s endureth for ever.</P>
<P>He &s;itteth on his throne in the centre, and the breath of his mouth giveth life to the world.</P>
<P>He toucheth the &s;tars with his finger, and they run their cour&s;e rejoicing.</P>
<P>On the wings of the wind he walketh abroad, and performeth his will through all the regions of unlimited &s;pace.</P>
<P>Order, and grace, and beauty, &s;pring from his hand.</P>
<P>The voice of wi&s;dom &s;peaketh in all his works; but the human under&s;tanding comprehendeth it not.</P>
<P>The &s;hadow of knowledge pa&s;&s;eth over the mind of man as a dream: He &s;eeth as in the dark; he rea&s;oneth and is deceived.</P>
<P>But the wi&s;dom of God is as the light of heaven: He rea&s;on|eth not; his mind is the fountain of truth.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice and mercy wait before his throne; benevolence and love enlighten his countenance for ever.</P>
<P>Who is like unto the Lord in glory? Who in power &s;hall con|tend with the Almighty? Hath he any equal in wi&s;dom? Can any in goodne&s;s be compared unto him?</P>
<P>He it is, O man! who hath created thee; thy &s;tation on earth is fixed by his appointment: The powers of thy mind are the gifts of his goodne&s;s, the wonders of thy frame are the work of his hand.</P>
<P>Hear then his voice, for it is gracious; and he that obeyeth &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in peace.</P>

<P>He foundeth his judgments on the principles of mercy; but in the puni&s;hment of offenders, he is &s;trict and impartial.</P>
<P>His ears are open to the complaints of his &s;ubjects; he re|&s;traineth the hand of their oppre&s;&s;ors, and delivereth them from their tyranny.</P>
<P>His people therefore look up to him as a father, with reverence and love: They con&s;ider him as the guardian of all they enjoy.</P>
<P>Their affection unto him begetteth in his brea&s;t a love of the public; the &s;ecurity of their happine&s;s is the object of his care.</P>
<P>No murmurs again&s;t him ari&s;e in their hearts; the machina|tions of his enemies endanger not his &s;tate.</P>
<P>His &s;ubject are faithful, and firm in his cau&s;e; they &s;tand in his defence as a wail of bra&s;s; the army of his enemy flieth before them, as chaff before the wind.</P>
<P>Security and peace ble&s;s the dwellings of his people; and glory and &s;trength encircle his throne for ever.</P>

<P>Rai&s;e it not too high, that thou be not de&s;pi&s;ed. Be not thou like unto tho&s;e that fall by climbing, neither deba&s;e it to the &s;en&s;e of brutes; nor be thou like to the hor&s;e and the mule, in whom there is no under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Search it by its faculties, know it by its virtues. They are more in number than the hairs of thy head; the &s;tars of Heaven are not to be counted with them.</P>

<P>AS the eye of the morning to the lark, as the &s;hade of evening to the owl, as honey to the bee, or as the carca&s;e to the vulture: even &s;uch is life unto the heart of man.</P>
<P>Tho' bright, it dazzleth not; tho' ob&s;cure, it di&s;plea&s;eth not; tho' &s;weet, it cloyeth not; tho' corrupt, it forbiddeth not: Yet who is he that knoweth its true value?</P>
<P>Learn to e&s;teem life as it ought; then art thou near the pin|nacle of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Think not with the fool, that nothing is more valuable; nor believe with the pretended wi&s;e, that thou oughte&s;t to contemn it. Love it not for it&s;elf, but for the good it may be of to others.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="022469_0047_0FB920E9D41EA668">Gold cannot buy it for thee, neither can mines of diamonds purcha&s;e back the moment thou ha&s;t now lo&s;t of it. Employ the &s;ucceeding ones in virtue.</P>
<P>Say not, that it were be&s;t not to have been born; or, if born, that it had been be&s;t to die early: Neither dare thou to a&s;k of thy Creator, where had been the evil, had I not exi&s;ted? Good is in thy power; the want of good is evil; and, if thy que&s;tion be ju&s;t, lo! it condemneth thee.</P>
<P>Would the fi&s;h &s;wallow the bait, if he knew the hook was hid therein? would the lion enter the toils, if he &s;aw they were prepared for him? So neither, were the &s;oul to per&s;h with this clay would man wi&s;h to live; neither would a merciful God have created him: Know hence thou &s;halt live afterward.</P>
<P>As the bird enclo&s;ed in the cage before he &s;eeth it, yet teare h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not his fle&s;h again&s;t its &s;ides; &s;o neither labour thou vainly to run from the &s;tate thou art in; but know it is allotted thee, and be content with it.</P>
<P>Though its ways are uneven, yet are they not all painful? Accommodate thy&s;elf to all; and where there is lea&s;t appearance of evil, &s;u&s;pect the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>When thy bed is &s;traw, thou &s;leepe&s;t in &s;ecurity; but when thou ha&s;t &s;tretched thy&s;elf on ro&s;es, beware of the thorns.</P>
<P>A good death is better than an evil life: Strive to live, there|fore, as long as thou oughte&s;t, not as long as thou can&s;t.</P>
<P>While thy life is to others worth more than thy death, it is thy duty to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Complain not with the fool, of the &s;hortne&s;s of thy time: Remember, that with thy days, thy cares are &s;hortened.</P>
<P>Take from the period of thy life the u&s;ele&s;s parts of it, and what remaineth? Take off the time of thine infancy, the &s;econd infancy of age, thy &s;leep, thy thoughtle&s;s hours, thy days of &s;ickne&s;s; and, even at the fullne&s;s of years, how few &s;ea&s;ons ha&s;t thou truly numbered.</P>
<P>He who gave thee life as a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hortened it to make it more &s;o. To what end would longer life have &s;erved thee? Wi&s;he&s;t thou to have had an opportunity of more vices? As to the good, will not he who limited thy &s;pan, be &s;atisfied with the fruits of it?</P>
<P>To what end, O child of &s;orrow! would&s;t thou live longer? To breathe, to eat, to &s;ee the world? All this thou ha&s;t done often already. Too frequent repetition, is it not tire&s;ome? or, is it not &s;uperfluous?</P>
<P>Woulde&s;t thou improve thy w&s;dom and thy virtue? Alas! what art thou to know? or who is it that &s;hall teach thee? Badly

<P>Repine not at the want of knowledge; it mu&s;t peri&s;h with thee in the grave. Be hone&s;t here, thou &s;halt be wi&s;e hereafter.</P>
<P>Say not unto the crow, why numbre&s;t thou &s;even times the age or thy lord? or to the fawn, Why are thine eyes to &s;ee my offspring to an hundreth generations? Are the&s;e to be compared with thee in the abu&s;e of life? are they riotous? are they cruel? are they ungrateful? Learn from them rather, that innocence of life and &s;implicity of manners are the paths to a good old age.</P>
<P>Knowe&s;t thou to employ life better than the&s;e? then le&s;s of it may &s;uffice thee.</P>
<P>Man who dares en&s;lave the world, when he knows he can enjoy his tyranny but a moment, what would he not aim at if he were immortal?</P>
<P>Enough ha&s;t thou of life, but thou regarde&s;t not: Thou art not in want of it, O man? but thou art prodigal: Thou throwe&s;t it lightly away, as if thou had&s;t more than enough; and yet thou repine&s;t that it is not gathering again unto thee.</P>
<P>Know that it is not abundance which maketh rich, but oeconomy.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e continueth to live from his fir&s;t period; the fool is always beginning.</P>
<P>Labour not after riches fir&s;t, and think thou afterwards wilt enjoy them. He who neglecteth the pre&s;ent moment, throweth away all that he hath. As the arrow pa&s;&s;eth through the heart, while the warrior knew not that it was coming; &s;o &s;hall his life be taken away, before he knoweth that he hath it.</P>
<P>What then is life, that man &s;hould de&s;ire it? what breathing, that he &s;hould covet it?</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;eene of delu&s;ion, a &s;eries of mi&s;adventure, a pur&s;uit of evils linked on all &s;ides together? In the beginning it is ignorance; pain is in its middle, and its end is &s;orrow. As one wave pu&s;heth on another, till both are involved in that behind them, even &s;o &s;ucceedeth evil to evil in the life of man; the greater and the pre&s;ent &s;wallow up the le&s;&s;er and the pa&s;t. Our terrors are real evils; our expectations look forward into impro|babilities.</P>
<P>Fools, to dread as mortals, and to de&s;ire as if immortal.</P>
<P>What part of life is it we would wi&s;h to remain with us? Is it youth! Can we be in love with outrage, licenciou&s;ne&s;s and temerity? Is it age? then are we fond of infirmities.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, grey hairs are revered, and in length of days is honour. Virtue can add reverence to the bloom of youth; and
<PB N="54" REF="022469_0049_0FB920ED45444C10">
without it, age plants more wrinkles in the &s;oul than on the forehead.</P>
<P>Is age re&s;pected becau&s;e it hateth riot? What ju&s;tice is in this, when it is not age de&s;pi&s;eth plea&s;ure, but plea&s;ure that de&s;pi&s;eth age?</P>

<P>Weep not therefore at the calamities of the human &s;tate; rather laugh at its follies. In the hands of the man addicted to vanity, life is but the &s;hadow of a dream.</P>
<P>The hero, the mo&s;t renowned of human characters, what is he but the bubble of this weekne&s;s? The public is un&s;table and ungrateful; why &s;hould the man of wi&s;dom endanger him&s;elf for fools?</P>

<P>Thou who flatte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t with fal&s;e hopes the criminal, that he may confe&s;s his guilt, art not thou unto him a criminal? or is thy guilt the le&s;s, becau&s;e he cannot puni&s;h it?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. COVETOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<P>RICHES are not worthy a &s;trong attention; therefore an earne&s;t care of obtaining them is unju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of what man calleth good, the joy he taketh in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, is grounded only in opinion. Take not up that from the vulgar; examine the worth of things thy&s;elf, and thou &s;halt not be covetous.</P>
<P>An immoderate de&s;ire of riches, is a poi&s;on lodged in the &s;oul. It contaminates and de&s;troys every thing that was good in it. It is no &s;ooner rooted there than all virtue, all hone&s;ty, all natu|ral affection, fly before the face of it.</P>
<P>The covetous would &s;ell his children for gold; his parent might die ere he would open his coffer; nay, he con&s;idereth not him&s;elf in re&s;pect of it; in the &s;earch of happine&s;s, he maketh him&s;elf unhappy.</P>
<P>As the man who &s;elleth his hou&s;e to purcha&s;e ornaments for the embelli&s;hment of it; even &s;o is he who giveth up peace in the &s;earch of riches, in hope he may be happy in enjoying them.</P>
<P>Where covetou&s;ne&s;s reigneth, know that the &s;oul is poor. Who&s;o accounteth not riches the principal good of man, will not throw away all other goods in the pur&s;uit of them.</P>
<P>Who&s;o feareth not poverty as the greate&s;t evil of his nature, will not purcha&s;e to him&s;elf all other evils in the avoiding of it.</P>
<P>Thou fool! is not virtue of more worth than riches? is not guilt more ba&s;e than poverty? Enough for his nece&s;&s;ities is in the power of every man; be content with it, and thy happine&s;s &s;hall &s;mile at the &s;orrows of him who heapeth up more.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="022469_0064_0FB92107D4B22050">Nature hath hid gold beneath the earth, as unworthy to be &s;een; &s;ilver hath &s;he placed, where thou trample&s;t it under thy feet. Meaneth &s;he not by this to inform thee, that gold is not worthy thy regard, that &s;ilver is beneath thy notice?</P>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s burieth under ground millions of wretches; the&s;e dig for their hard ma&s;ters, what returneth the injury? what maketh them more mi&s;erable than their &s;laves?</P>
<P>The earth is barren of good things where &s;he hoardeth up trea|&s;ure: Where gold is in her bowels, there no herb groweth.</P>
<P>As the hor&s;e findeth not there his gra&s;s, nor the mule his pro|vender; as the fields of corn laugh not on the &s;ides of the hills; as the olive holdeth not forth there her fruits, nor the vine her clu&s;ters: Even &s;o no good dwelleth in the brea&s;t of him, who&s;e heart broodeth over his trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Riches are &s;ervants to the wi&s;e; but they are tyrants over the &s;oul of the fool.</P>
<P>The covetous &s;erveth his gold; it &s;erveth not him. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth his wealth, as the &s;ick doth a fever; it burneth and tortur|eth him, and will not quit him unto death.</P>
<P>Hath not gold de&s;troyed the virtue of millions? did it ever add to the goodne&s;s of any? Is it not mo&s;t abundant with the wor&s;t of men? wherefore then &s;hould&s;t thou de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it? Have not the wi&s;e&s;t been tho&s;e who have had lea&s;t of it? and is not wi&s;dom happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Have not the wor&s;t of thy &s;pecies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t portions of it? and hath not their end been mi&s;erable?</P>
<P>Poverty wanteth many things; but covetou&s;ne&s;s denieth it&s;elf all.</P>
<P>The covetous, can be good to no man; but he is to none &s;o cruel as to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be indu&s;trious to procure gold, and be generous in the di&s;po&s;al of it. Man never is &s;o happy, as when he giveth happine&s;s unto another.</P>

<P>IF there be a vice greater than the hoarding up of riches; it is the employing them to u&s;ele&s;s purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>It is more difficult to be well with riches, than to be at ea&s;e under the want of them. Man governeth him&s;elf much ea&s;ier in poverty, than in abundance.</P>
<P>Poverty requireth but one virtue, patience to &s;upport it: The rich, if he hath not charity, temperance, prudence, and many more, is guilty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. REVENGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE root of revenge is in the weakne&s;s of the &s;oul; the mo&s;t abject and timorous are the mo&s;t addicted to it.</P>
<P>Who torture tho&s;e they hate, but cowards? Who murder tho&s;e they rob, but the ba&s;e and timid?</P>
<P>The feeling an injury, mu&s;t be previous to the revenging it: but the noble mind di&s;daineth to &s;ay it hurts me.</P>
<P>If the injury is not below thy notice, he that doth it unto thee, in that maketh him&s;elf &s;o: Would&s;t thou enter the li&s;ts with thine inferior?</P>
<P>Requite with kindne&s;s the man who attempteth to wrong thee: do good to him who would give thee di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>In this thou not only pre&s;erve&s;t thine own peace, but thou in|flicte&s;t puni&s;hment, without &s;tooping to employ revenge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>As the tempe&s;t and the thunder affect not the &s;un or the &s;tars, but &s;pend their fury on &s;tones and trees below; &s;o injuries a&s;cend not to the &s;ouls of the great, but wa&s;te them&s;elves on &s;uch as tho&s;e are who offer them.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="022469_0066_0FB9210AD3D627D0">Poorne&s;s of &s;pirit will actuate revenge; greatne&s;s of &s;oul de&s;|pi&s;eth the offence: nay, it doth good unto him who intended to have di&s;burbed it.</P>
<P>Why &s;eeke&s;t thou vengeance, O man! with what purpo&s;e is it that thou pur&s;ue&s;t it? Thinke&s;t thou to pain thine adver&s;ary by it? Know, that thy&s;elf feele&s;t its greate&s;t torment.</P>
<P>Revenge gnaweth the heart of him who is infected with it; while he again&s;t whom it is intended, remaineth ea&s;y.</P>
<P>It is unju&s;t in the angui&s;h it inflicts; therefore, Nature intend|ed it not for thee: Needeth he who is injured, more pain? or ought he to add force to the affliction which another hath ca&s;t upon him?</P>
<P>The man who meditateth revenge, is not content with the mi&s;chief he hath received; he addeth to his angui&s;h the puni&s;h|ment due unto another: While he whom he &s;eeketh to hurt, goeth his way laughing; he maketh him&s;elf merry at this addi|tion to his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Revenge is painful in the intent, and it is dangerous in the ex|ecution: Seldom doth the axe fall, where he who lifteth it up intended; and lo! he remembereth not that it mu&s;t recoil again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the revengeful &s;eeketh his enemy's hurt, be oftentimes procureth his own de&s;truction; while he aimeth at one of the eyes of his adver&s;ary, lo! he putteth out both his own.</P>
<P>If he attain not his end, he lamenteth it; if he &s;ucceed, he repenteth of it: The fear of ju&s;tice taketh away the peace of his own &s;oul; the care to hide him from it, de&s;troyeth that of his friend.</P>
<P>Can the death of thine adver&s;ary &s;atiate thy hatred? Can the &s;etting him at re&s;t re&s;tore thy peace?</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou make him &s;orry for the offence, conquer him, by &s;paring him: In death he owneth not thy &s;uperiority; nor feeleth he any more the power of thy wrath.</P>
<P>In revenge, there &s;hould be a triumph of the avenger; and he who hath injured him, &s;hould feel his di&s;plea&s;ure: He &s;hould &s;uffer pain from it, and &s;hould repent him of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This is the revenge in&s;pired from anger; but that which make thee greater, is to repay injuries with kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Murder for an injury, ari&s;eth only from cowardice: He who inflicteth it feareth that the enemy may live, and avenge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Death endeth the quarrel; but it re&s;toreth not the reputation: Killing is an act of caution, not of courage; it is &s;afe, but it is not honourable.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o ea&s;y as to revenge an offence, but nothing is &s;o honourable as to pardon it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="022469_0067_0FB9210C54884578">The greate&s;t victory man can obtain, is over him&s;elf: He that di&s;daineth to feel an injury, retorteth it upon him who offereth it.</P>

<P>That cannot be an injury which is not felt; how then can he who de&s;pi&s;eth it revenge it?</P>
<P>If thou think it di&s;honourable to bear an offence, more is in thy power; thou maye&s;t conquer it.</P>
<P>Good offices will make a man a&s;hamed to be thine enemy; greatne&s;s of &s;oul will terrify him from the thought of hurting thee.</P>
<P>The greater the wrong, the more glory is in pardoning it; and by how much the more ju&s;tifiable would be revenge, by &s;o much the more honour is in clemency,</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou a right to be a judge in thine own cau&s;e; to be a party in the Act, and yet to pronounce &s;entence on it? Before thou condemne&s;t, let another &s;ay it is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The revengeful is feared, and therefore he is hated: but he that is endued with clemency, is adored: The prai&s;e of his actions remaineth forever; and the love of the world attendeth him.</P>

<P>REVENGE is dete&s;table: What then is cruelty? Lo! it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the mi&s;chiefs of the other; but it wanteth even the pretence of its provocations.</P>
<P>Men di&s;own it as not of their nature; they are a&s;hamed of it, as a &s;tranger to their hearts: Do they not call it inhumanity?</P>

<P>What is there that a man may not turn unto his good? In that which offendeth us mo&s;t, there is more ground for complaint than hatred. Man would be reconciled to him of whom he com|plaineth: What murdereth he, but what he hateth?</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. NOBILITY and HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>NOBILITY re&s;ideth not but in the &s;oul: nor is there true honour except in virtue.</P>
<P>The favour of princes may be bought by rank and vices; titles may be purcha&s;ed for money: But the&s;e are not true honour.</P>
<P>Crimes cannot exalt the man who commits them to real glory; neither can gold make men noble.</P>
<P>When titles are the reward of virtue, when he is &s;et on high who hath &s;erved his country; he who be&s;toweth the honours hath glory, like as he who receiveth them; and the world is benefit|ted by it.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou wi&s;h to be rai&s;ed for men know not what? or would&s;t thou that they &s;hould &s;ay, Why is this?</P>
<P>When the virtues of the hero de&s;cend to his children, his titles accompany them well; but when he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth them is un|like unto him who de&s;erved them, lo! do they not call him degenerate?</P>
<P>Hereditary honour is accounted the mo&s;t noble; but rea&s;on &s;peaketh in the cau&s;e of him who hath acquired it.</P>
<P>He who, meritle&s;s him&s;elf, appealeth to the actions of his ance&s;tors for his greatne&s;s, is like the thief who claimeth protec|tion by flying to the pagod.</P>
<P>What good is it to the blind, that his parents could &s;ee? what benefit is it to the dumb, that his grandfather was eloquent? Even &s;o, what is it to the mean, that their predece&s;&s;ors were noble?</P>
<P>A mind di&s;po&s;ed to virtue maketh great the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it; and without titles, it will rai&s;e him above the vulgar.</P>
<P>He will acquire honour, while others receive it; and will he not &s;ay unto them, Such were the men whom you glory in being derived from?</P>
<P>As the &s;hadow waiteth on the &s;ub&s;tance, even &s;o true honour attendeth on virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="022469_0073_0FB92116D5389630">Say not that honour is the child of boldne&s;s, nor believe thou that the hazard of life alone can pay the price of it: It is not to the action that it is due, but to the manner of performing it.</P>
<P>All are not called to the guiding the helm of &s;tate; neither are their armies to be commanded by every one: Do well in that which is committed to thy charge, and prai&s;e &s;hall remain upon thee.</P>
<P>Say not that difficulties are nece&s;&s;ary to be conquered, or that labour and danger mu&s;t be in the way to renown. The woman who is cha&s;te, is &s;he not prai&s;ed? the man who is hone&s;t, de|&s;erveth he not to be honoured?</P>
<P>The thir&s;t of fame is violent; the de&s;ire of honour is power|ful; and he who gave them to us, gave them for great purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>When de&s;perate actions are nece&s;&s;ary to the public; when our lives are to be expo&s;ed for the good of our country: what can add force to virtue, but ambition?</P>
<P>It is not the receiving honour that delighteth the noble mind; its pride is the de&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Is it not better men &s;hould &s;ay, Why hath not this man a &s;ta|tue? than that they &s;hould a&s;k, Why he hath one?</P>
<P>The ambitious will always be fir&s;t in the croud; he pre&s;&s;eth forward, he looketh not behind him. More angui&s;h is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o his &s;oul, to &s;ee one before him, than joy to leave thou&s;ands at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The root of ambition is in every man; but it ri&s;eth not in all: Fear keepeth it down in &s;ome; in many it is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is the inner garment of the &s;oul; the fir&s;t thing put on by it with the fle&s;h, and the la&s;t it layeth down at its &s;eparation from it.</P>
<P>It is an honour to thy nature when worthily employed; when thou directe&s;t it to wrong purpo&s;es, it &s;hameth and de&s;troyeth thee.</P>
<P>In the brea&s;t of the traitor ambition is covered; hypocri&s;y hideth its face under her mantle; and cool di&s;&s;imulation furni&s;h|eth it with &s;mooth words: but in the end, men &s;hall &s;ee what it is.</P>
<P>The &s;erpent loo&s;eth not his &s;ting, tho' benumbed with the fro&s;t; the tooth of the viper is not broken, tho' the cold clo&s;eth his mouth: Take pity on his &s;tate, and he will &s;hew thee his &s;pirit; warm him in thy bo&s;om, and he will requite thee with death.</P>
<P>He that is truly virtuous, loveth virtue for her&s;elf; he di&s;|daineth the applau&s;e which ambition aimeth after.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="022469_0074_0FB92118540DD1D0">How pitiable were the &s;tate of virtue, if &s;he could not be happy but from another's prai&s;e? She is too noble to &s;eek re|compence, and no more will, than can be rewarded.</P>
<P>The higher the &s;un ari&s;eth, the le&s;s &s;hadow doth he make: Even &s;o the greater is the virtue, the le&s;t doth it covet prai&s;e; yet cannot it avoid its reward in honours.</P>
<P>Glory, like a &s;hadow, flieth him who pur&s;ueth it; but it fol|loweth at the heels of him who would fly from it: If thou courte&s;t it without merit, thou &s;halt never attain unto it; if thou de&s;erve&s;t it, though thou hide&s;t thy&s;elf, it will never for|&s;ake thee.</P>
<P>Pur&s;ue that which is honourable, do that which is right; and the applau&s;e of thine own con&s;cience will be more joy to thee, than the &s;houts of millions who know not that thou de&s;erve&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. SCIENCE and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble&s;t employment of the mind of man is the &s;tudy of the works of his Creator.</P>
<P>To him whom the &s;cience of nature delighteth, every object bringeth a proof of his God; every thing that proveth it, giveth cau&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">doration.</P>
<P>His mind is lifted up to heaven every moment; his life is one continued act of devotion.</P>
<P>Ca&s;teth he his eye towards the clouds, findeth he not the heavens full of his wonders? Looketh he down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the earth, doth not the worm proclaim to him, Le&s;s than Omnipotence could not have formed me?</P>
<P>While the planets perform their cour&s;es; while the &s;un re|maineth in his place; while the comet wandereth thro' the liquid air, and returneth to its de&s;tined road again: Who but thy God, O man! could have formed them? what but infinite wi&s;dom could have appointed them their laws?</P>
<P>Behold, how awful their &s;plendor! yet do they not dimini&s;h: Lo, how rapid their motions! yet one runneth not in the way of another.</P>
<P>Look down upon the earth, and &s;ee her produce, examine her bowels, and behold what they contain! Hath not wi&s;dom and power ordained the whole?</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="022469_0075_0FB92119D44CFDB0">Who biddeth the gra&s;s to &s;pring up? who watereth it at its due &s;ea&s;ons? Behold! the ox croppeth it; the hor&s;e and the &s;heep, feed they not upon it? Who is he that provideth it for them?</P>
<P>Who giveth increa&s;e to the corn which thou &s;owe&s;t? who re|turneth it to thee a thou&s;and fold?</P>
<P>Who ripeneth for thee the olive in its time? and the grape, though thou knowe&s;t not the cau&s;e of it?</P>
<P>Can the meane&s;t fly create it&s;elf? or wert thou ought le&s;s than God, could&s;t thou have fa&s;hioned it?</P>
<P>The bea&s;ts feel that they exi&s;t, but they wonder not at it; they rejoice in their life, but they know not that it &s;hall end: Each performeth its cour&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; nor is there a lo&s;s of one &s;pecies in thou&s;and generations.</P>
<P>Thou who &s;ee&s;t the whole as admirable as its parts, can&s;t thou better employ thine eye, than in tracing out thy Creator's great|ne&s;s in them? thy mind, than in examining their wonders?</P>
<P>Power and mercy are di&s;played in their formation; ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s &s;hine forth in the provi&s;ion that is made for them: All are happy in their &s;everal ways; nor envieth one the other.</P>
<P>What is the &s;tudy of words compared with this? In what &s;cience is knowledge, but in the &s;tudy of nature?</P>
<P>When thou ha&s;t adored the fabric, enquire into its u&s;e; for know, the earth produceth nothing but what may be good to thee. Are not food and raiment, and the remedies for thy di&s;|ea&s;es, all derived from this &s;ource alone?</P>
<P>Who is wi&s;e then, but he that knoweth it? who hath under|&s;tanding, but he that contemplateth it? For the re&s;t, whatever &s;cience hath mo&s;t utility, whatever knowledge hath lea&s;t vanity, prefer the&s;e unto the others; and profit of them for the &s;ake of thy neighbour.</P>
<P>To live, and to die; to command, and to obey; to do, and to &s;uffer: Are not the&s;e all that thou ha&s;t further to care about? Morality &s;hall teach thee the&s;e; the Oeconony of life &s;hall lay them before thee.</P>
<P>Behold! they are written in thy heart, and thou neede&s;t only to be reminded of them: They are ea&s;y of conception; be at|tentive, and thou &s;halt retain them.</P>
<P>All other &s;ciences are vain, all other knowledge is boa&s;t: Lo! it is not nece&s;&s;ary or beneficial to man; nor doth it make him more good, or more hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Piety to thy God, and benevolence to thy fellow-creatures, are they not thy great duties? What &s;hall teach thee the one, like the &s;tudy of his works? what &s;hall inform thee of the other, like under&s;tanding thy dependencies?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. PROSPERITY and ADVERSITY.</HEAD>
<P>LET not pro&s;perity elate thine heart above mea&s;ure; neither depre&s;s thy &s;oul unto the grave, becau&s;e fortune beareth hard again&s;t thee.</P>
<P>Her &s;miles are not &s;table, therefore build not thy confidence upon them; her frowns endure not for ever, therefore let hope teach thee patience.</P>
<P>To bear adver&s;ity well, is difficult; but to be temperate in pro&s;perity, is the height of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Good and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll are the te&s;ts by which thou art to know thy con|&s;tancy; nor is there aught el&s;e that can tell thee the powers of thine own &s;oul: Be therefore upon the watch, when they are upon thee.</P>
<P>Behold pro&s;perity, how &s;weetly &s;he flattereth thee! how in|&s;en&s;ibly &s;he robbeth thee of thy &s;trength and thy vigour!</P>
<P>Tho thou ha&s;t been con&s;tant in ill fortune; though thou ha&s;t been invincible in di&s;tre&s;s; yet by her thou art conquered, not knowing that thy &s;trength returneth not again; and yet that thou again maye&s;t need it.</P>
<P>Affliction moveth our enemies to pity; &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s cau&s;e even our friends to envy.</P>
<P>In adver&s;ity, is the &s;eed of well-doing; it is the nur&s;e of heroi&s;m and boldne&s;s: Who that hath enough will endanger him&s;elf to have more? who that is at ea&s;e, will &s;et his life on the hazard.</P>
<P>True virtue will act under all circum&s;tances; but men &s;ee mo&s;t of its effects, when accidents concur with it.</P>
<P>In adver&s;ity, man &s;eeth him&s;elf abandoned by others; he findeth that all his hopes are centered within him&s;elf: He rou&s;eth his &s;oul, he encountereth his difficulties, and they yield before him.</P>
<P>In pro&s;perity, he fancieth him&s;elf &s;afe; he thinketh he is be|loved of all that &s;mile about his table: He groweth carele&s;s and remi&s;s; he &s;eeth not the danger that is before him: He tru&s;teth to others, and in the end they deceive him.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="022469_0077_0FB9211CD48AF110">Every man can advi&s;e his own &s;oul in di&s;tre&s;s; but pro&s;perity blindeth the truth.</P>
<P>Better is the &s;orrow that leadeth to contentment, than the joy that rendereth man unable to endure di&s;tre&s;s, and afterwards plungeth him into it.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;&s;ions dictate to us in all our extremes. Moderation is the effect of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Be upright in thy whole life; be content in all its changes: So &s;halt thou make thy profit out of all occurrences; &s;o &s;hall every thing that happeneth unto thee, be the &s;ource of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e man maketh every thing the means of advantage; and with the &s;ame countenance beholdeth he all the faces of for|tune: He governeth the good, he conquereth the evil; he is unmoved in all.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ume not in pro&s;perity, neither de&s;pair in adver&s;ity: Court not dangers, nor meanly fly from before them: Dare to de&s;pi&s;e whatever will not remain with thee.</P>
<P>Let not adver&s;ity tear off the wings of hope; neither let pro&s;|perity ob&s;cure the light of prudence.</P>

<P>He who calleth pro&s;perity his good; who hath &s;aid unto her, With thee will I e&s;tabli&s;h my happine&s;s: Lo! he buildeth his foundation on the &s;and, which the rain and &s;torms wa&s;h away.</P>
<P>As the water that pa&s;&s;eth from the mountains, ki&s;&s;eth, in its way to the ocean, every field that bordereth on the rivers; as it tarrieth not in any place; even &s;o fortune vi&s;iteth the &s;ons of men: Her motion is ince&s;&s;ant, &s;he will dot &s;tay; &s;he is as un|&s;table as the winds, how then wilt thou hold her?

<HEAD>CHAP. II. PAIN and SICKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ickne&s;s of the body affecteth even the &s;oul; the one cannot be in health without the other.</P>
<P>Pain is of all ills that which is mo&s;t felt; and it is that which from nature hath the fewe&s;t remedies.</P>

<P>Would&s;t thou judge of a life, examine the period of it; the end crowneth the attempt: And where di&s;&s;imulation is no more the truth appeareth.</P>
<P>He hath not &s;pent his life ill, who knoweth to die well; nei|ther can he have lo&s;t all his time, who employeth the la&s;t portion of it to his honour.</P>
<P>He was not born in vain, who dieth as he ought; neither hath he lived unprofitably, who dieth happily.</P>
<P>He that con&s;idereth he is to die, is content while he liveth; He who &s;triveth to forget it, hath no plea&s;ure in any thing; his joy appeareth to him a jewel, which he expecteth every moment he &s;hall lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou learn to die nobly! let thy vices die before thee. Happy is he who endeth the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life, before his death; who when the hour of it cometh hath nothing to do but to die; who witheth not delay, becau&s;e he hath no longer u&s;e for time.</P>

<P>Think not the longe&s;t life the happie&s;t; that which is be&s;t employed, doth man the mo&s;t honour: him&s;elf &s;hall rejoice after death, in the advantages of it.</P>
