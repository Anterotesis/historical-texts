<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;cended the throne of the&s;e realms with advantages, which, if properly im|proved, would have rendered your reign not only glorious and happy, but have made you the mo&s;t powerful monarch upon earth; you might have kept the world in awe. Yet, oh &s;hame to tell, though the times demand it, you &s;oon &s;acrificed your own peace, the tranquillity, honor and intere&s;t of this great and mighty king|dom, to the ambitious views, and pernicious de|&s;igns, of your infernal minion Lord Bute, and
<PB N="66" REF="013968_0002_0F925B44CABABC10">his profligate, abandoned adherents. Your acce&s;|&s;ion to the throne filled with joy the brea&s;t of every Engli&s;hman; but alas, it was of &s;hort du|ration, you &s;oon convinced them of their mi&s;take, and the compliments paid to your under&s;tanding, the calm hour of rea&s;on &s;oon convinced us were ill founded.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner &s;eated upon the throne of this va&s;t empire, than you, like all other Kings, as well as tyrants, made the people many and fair promi&s;es. You told your Parliament, that the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and immorality, the encouragement of trade and commerce, and the pre&s;ervation of peace and harmony among&s;t your people, &s;hould be the rule of your conduct, and your principal &s;tudy. How far you have kept your word, the &s;acred pen of truth &s;hall now declare.</P>
<P>Scarce &s;eated in regal dignity before you drove from your pre&s;ence and councils, by the advice of your Scotch favourite, Lord Bute, every man of honor and integrity, who was valued for his love to his country, and affection for your family. You implicitly followed the advice of your Nor|thern minion, and in their room took tho&s;e only who were the mo&s;t con&s;picuous for their vices, and the mo&s;t abandoned in principle; the&s;e are facts which Sandwich, Bute, Grafton, North, &amp;c. will confirm.</P>
<P>The&s;e men you &s;till continue to countenance, every &s;cene of iniquity they have been concerned in, and every act of violence, oppre&s;&s;ion, and murder they have committed, has been by you tacitly approved, nay applauded. Adultery, de|bauchery, and divorces, are more frequent now than in the corrupt and profligate days of Charles the Second; the&s;e, Sir, prove inconte&s;tibly your
<PB N="67" REF="013968_0003_0F925B46029919A0">religious principles, and &s;how how far you have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed vice and immorality.</P>
<P>It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, how far you have encouraged trade and commerce, was it by illegally impo&s;ing a &s;tamp duty on the Americans, and taxing tho&s;e commodities which we &s;upplied them with from this country, which has &s;topped for near &s;ix years a great traffic between this king|dom and the colonies? Was it by &s;uffering, with the mo&s;t &s;hameful impunity, the Portugue&s;e to infringe upon the privileges of the Engli&s;h mer|chants at Li&s;bon, by which many were not only injured, but almo&s;t totally ruined? Was it by blocking up the port, and de&s;troying the trade of the town of Bo&s;ton, thereby reducing to a &s;tate of mi&s;erable dependance more than thirty thou&s;and people, and giving a vital &s;tab to the whole com|merce of America?</P>
<P>We will now examine, Sir, how far you have pre&s;erved peace and harmony among your people; was it by providing for all the beggarly relations, and mi&s;erable dependents, of your Scotch minion, in preference to your Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were the chief in&s;truments of placing your family upon the throne? Was it by ordering the late Lord Hallifax to i&s;&s;ue an illegal warrant for apprehending Mr. Wilkes? Was it by reward|ing that delinquent after he had been found guilty of a breach of the Engli&s;h laws? Was it by &s;creening your mini&s;ter behind the throne, who violated the rights of the freeholders of England? Was it by rejecting the petitions of your injured &s;ubjects, and laughing at the remon&s;trance pre|&s;ented to you from the fir&s;t city in the world, the great capital of the Briti&s;h empire? Was it by not granting the &s;upplications of your people, and
<PB N="68" REF="013968_0004_0F925B4639F0E6A8">meanly referring tho&s;e petitions and remon&s;trances to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e very men, who&s;e con|duct they arraigned, and who were only the &s;lavi&s;h tools of your abandoned mini&s;ters? Was it by &s;ending troops to Bo&s;ton, depriving the people of their con&s;titutional rights; and, contrary to all the laws of this free country, enforcing the tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive acts of your abandoned Parliament with the &s;word, and laying America under a mi|litary government? Was it by rewarding the pro|fligate, the corrupt, and the plunderers of their country, with titles and honors? Was it by a tame da&s;tardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the in&s;ults of the Spaniards, and a &s;acrifice of the honor of the Bri|ti&s;h nation? The&s;e, Sir, are the means you have made u&s;e of for pre&s;erving peace and harmony among your people. But, Sir, the greate&s;t piece of mini&s;terial villany, and diabolical cruelty, is &s;till behind, it is now going through the Hou&s;e of Lords, and you, Sir, will &s;oon be called upon to &s;ign it; it is a bill for re&s;training the American fi&s;hery, and &s;tarving to death, or driving to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, more than 300,000 people; con|&s;ider, Sir, the fatal tendency of this bill, deter|mine no longer to be the dupe of an abandoned &s;et of men, act from your&s;elf, and refu&s;e to &s;ign an act of parliament, which mu&s;t involve one part of the empire in a civil war, and reduce thou|&s;ands of your &s;ubjects to poverty and want. Let no con&s;ideration prevail with you to execute a deed, at the idea of which humanity revolts; con&s;ider, Sir, how much this will rai&s;e the indignation of your people here, when they find you are de&s;titute of the common feelings of humanity, and that you can be &s;o ea&s;ily prevailed upon to &s;acrifice your &s;ubjects to the cruel de&s;igns of your mini&s;ters
<PB N="69" REF="013968_0005_0F925B46F714E038">and favourites. Give &s;ome proof of a determined re&s;olution no longer to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures which mu&s;t end in the de&s;truction of your kingdoms, and perhaps in the ruin of your family.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Sir, how de&s;pi&s;able you appear in the eyes of the world; who, in&s;tead of governing, &s;uffer your&s;elf to be governed; who, in&s;tead of being a leader, are lead; who, in&s;tead of being a King, are nothing but a mere cypher of &s;tate, while your favourite and mini&s;ters wear all the appendages to &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>It has long &s;urprized the kingdom, to think how you could bear &s;uch wretches to prey upon you, to think how you could &s;uffer them to aggran|dize them&s;elves and creatures, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the grea|te&s;t wealth, and to hold the fir&s;t offices in the kingdom; and all this by impo&s;ing upon you, by making you break your coronation oath; by mak|ing you violate every promi&s;e you made with your people, and by filling your ears with lies, in&s;tead of truth; how is it po&s;&s;ible you can bear &s;uch u&s;age, which no &s;en&s;ible man in a private capacity can bear? And be the dupe of the vile&s;t of the creation, is &s;o much beneath the dignity of a man who pretends to govern, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uch fiends &s;hould prevail as they do; indeed they ne|ver could unle&s;s you, Sir, like them, was in|clined to e&s;tabli&s;h an arbitrary &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, and to &s;et up your own will in oppo&s;ition to the laws of the land.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e you, Sir, as you regard your own pro&s;perity, and the welfare of your kingdom, let me conjure you, as you value your own &s;afety, to con&s;ider well the fatal and ruinous mea&s;ures your mini&s;ters are pur&s;uing, and you &s;anctifying with the royal authority; con&s;ider the mi&s;erable, the
<PB N="70" REF="013968_0006_0F925B47CF251340">unfortunate &s;ituation of this country; think on the dangers which threaten it on every &s;ide; con&s;ider we are now upon the eye of a civil war with our co|lonies; from the pre&s;ent face of things, it is ine|vitable; trade and commerce is at a &s;tand, and all the horrors of wretchedne&s;s and want &s;tare them in the face; con&s;ider, Sir, the feelings of men reduced in the &s;hort &s;pace of a few days, through wanton acts of power, from a &s;tate of ea&s;e and plenty to that of mi&s;ery and famine; I a&s;k, is it po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;et bounds to their re&s;entments; con&s;ider, Sir, the French and Spaniards will not long remain idle &s;pectators, when once they &s;ee us deeply engaged in a war with the colonies. Throw off then your &s;upine indolence; awake from your lethargic &s;tate; and if you will not be excited by the de&s;ire of doing good, awake at lea&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of your own danger; think when the general ca|lamity comes on, who will be the objects of pub|lic hatred. Will not the advi&s;ers of the&s;e de&s;truc|tive mea&s;ures be the fir&s;t &s;acrifices to the popular re&s;entment. When the merchants, traders, and manufactures are &s;tarving, when the whole body of the people are in mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, what &s;e|curity, Sir, can you expect to find? Where will your mini&s;ters conceal them&s;elves? They will not be &s;afe even within the walls of your palace!</P>
<P>Let the&s;e things, Sir, be well weighed, and no longer per&s;uade your&s;elf the people was made for you, and not you for them; no longer believe that you do not govern for them but for your&s;elf; that the people live only to increa&s;e your glory, or to furni&s;h matter for plea&s;ure: For once, Sir, con&s;i|der what you may do for them, and not what you may draw from them.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="013968_0007_0F925B4C634F9CA0">
The people, Sir, think it to be a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude to convert that power to their hurt, which was intended for their good; and to obey a King, while he acts in this manner, and tramples under foot all laws, divine and human, argues not only a want of &s;en&s;e in the highe&s;t degree, but a want of love for our country, and a di&s;regard for our&s;elves and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Your &s;ubjects, Sir, are under no obligations to you, nor do they owe you any allegiance any lon|ger than you continue to protect them, and make their good the chief end of your government. When a Prince a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf an extravagant, or an unlawful power, then all re&s;pect cea&s;es, and he cea&s;es to be a King; whil&s;t he protects and pre&s;erves his people in their ju&s;t right, and governs them by the laws of the land, all good men will love and e&s;teem him, and ri&s;k their lives and for|tunes in his &s;ervice; but when he begins to invade their liberties, to &s;et up an arbitrary power, to im|po&s;e unlawful taxes, rai&s;e forces, and make war upon his people, and &s;uffer foreign &s;tates to in&s;ult and injure them, then all virtuous and good men will dete&s;t and abhor him, and endeavour to re|move him from a throne he unworthily fills.</P>
<P>In &s;uch ca&s;es re&s;i&s;tance is a virtue, and to &s;ay that &s;ome &s;hould pa&s;&s;ively &s;uffer, le&s;t by re&s;i&s;ting they &s;hould cau&s;e the ruin of many, is not a ju&s;t rea&s;on; becau&s;e, in all probability, they will be the cau&s;e that millions unborn &s;hall live happy and free, and what can be a more noble, glorious, and pious motive for &s;uffering than to tran&s;mit li|berty to po&s;terity: For this our fathers bravely fought, and many of them gloriou&s;ly fell, to pre|&s;erve them&s;elves and their de&s;cendants free, and to de&s;troy the tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m of the Stuarts;
<PB N="72" REF="013968_0008_0F925B4E3841FA40">and, Sir, let me beg you will remember with gratitude, to place your family upon the throne of the Briti&s;h Empire.</P>
<P>The author of this paper is far from advi&s;ing violent mea&s;ures upon every error, or mi&s;con|duct of a Prince, but re&s;i&s;tance becomes a duty, when they attempt the ruin of the &s;tate, the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of liberty, or overturning the con&s;titution of the kingdom. It is notorious to the world, Sir, that your mini&s;ters are guilty of all the&s;e black, and deadly crimes, and yet you &s;creen and protect them; the conclu&s;ions to be drawn from thence are obvious, and you, like CHARLES, may live to &s;ee your FAVORITES FALL.</P>
