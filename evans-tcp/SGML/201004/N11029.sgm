<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>SATURDAY, April</HI> 22, 1775.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary defen&s;ive war, on the part of America, ju&s;tified by the laws of God, nature, rea|&s;on, &s;tate and nations; and there|fore no trea&s;on or rebellion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT mu&s;t be apparent to every Engli&s;hman, not blinded by malice or ignorance, that the Americans, by rai&s;ing forces, and tak|ing up arms, have no intention to offer vio|lence to his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, crown or dig|nity, nor to draw any Engli&s;h blood; but only to defend them&s;elves, their rights and liberties, again&s;t encroaching violence and lawle&s;s power, to re&s;cue his Maje&s;ty out of the hands of his pre&s;ent evil malignant ad|vi&s;ers, to bring him back to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his duty, and tho&s;e delinquents to condign puni&s;hment, who are now engaged in a de&s;|perate con&s;piracy again&s;t the natural rights of mankind. The Americans have endeavoured, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to accommodate the
<PB N="114" REF="013979_0002_0F92596D02093D80">pre&s;ent unhappy di&s;pute with the King and his infernal minions, upon ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and honorable terms, but hitherto in vain. His Maje&s;ty having, contrary to his oath, his duty, and the fundamental laws of God and the realm, &s;ent an army of mercenary &s;oldiers to America again&s;t his &s;ubjects, for the avowed and open purpo&s;e of robbing them of their peace, their rights, their liberties, their properties, or their lives, and to impo&s;e un|lawful taxes by force of arms; the Ameri|cans may lawfully and ju&s;tly, by the great principles of the con&s;titution, without any trea&s;on or rebellion, take up arms in defence of their privileges, laws, lives, liberties and properties; even if the King were pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t and encourage his &s;oldiers in this un|natural, bloody, and de&s;tructive civil war.</P>
<P>When a King throws off all re&s;traint of law, and is bound by no principles of ju&s;tice or humanity, when he invades with open force the liberties and per&s;ons of his &s;ubjects in a ho&s;|tile manner, only to an&s;wer the mo&s;t diabolical, arbitrary, and infamous purpo&s;es, the people of England, and every part of the Briti&s;h empire, will be ju&s;tified in taking up arms, and re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch inva&s;ions and violence; otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t fall a prey to his in&s;atiable rapine, and become the ab&s;olute &s;laves of ar|bitrary power, by way of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal in&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of this country, and in many ages, of the peo|ple
<PB N="115" REF="013979_0003_0F92596DD5013280">of England re&s;i&s;ting, by force of arms, the oppre&s;&s;ions, rapines, unju&s;t violence, and armies of their Princes rai&s;ed again&s;t them; and they have even encountered their Kings in open battle, and taken them pri&s;oners; &s;ometimes expelled, and at other times depo|&s;ed them from their royal authority, when they became incorrigible, open and profe&s;&s;ed enemies to the kingdom, and &s;ought the ruin and de&s;olation of their &s;ubjects; when by office, duty, oath, and common ju&s;tice, they were bound inviolably to protect them in li|berty and peace. Among many other exam|ples of &s;uch proceedings, and the bravery and virtue of our ance&s;tors, are the following, <HI>viz.</HI> the ca&s;e of King John, Henry the Third, Ed|ward the Fir&s;t, Richard the Third, and Henry the Sixth; nor are the&s;e examples &s;ingular, all kingdoms, and in all ages, have done the &s;ame, when their Kings (like the pre&s;ent So|vereign on the throne of England) degene|rated into tyrants, of which there are infinite precedents in hi&s;tory; and &s;uch actions in every age and nation have always been deem|ed lawful and ju&s;t, as warranted by the laws of God, nature, rea&s;on, &s;tate and nations, all which in&s;truct not only particular per&s;ons, but whole cities and kingdoms, for their own nece&s;&s;ary defence and pre&s;ervation, the &s;up|port of human &s;ociety and liberty, to protect them&s;elves again&s;t all unlawful violence and tyranny, even in the per&s;on of their Kings,
<PB N="116" REF="013979_0004_0F92596E81AA6828">their mini&s;ters, or minions, to whom the laws of God, nature, man, nor any civil nation, ever yet gave the lea&s;t authority to murder, &s;poil, oppre&s;s, or en&s;lave their &s;ubjects, or deprive them of their liberties or e&s;tates; re&s;i&s;tance were it unlawful or unju&s;t (as the pimps and pari&s;ites of a court would in&s;inuate) a few ambitious, bloody minded, tyrannizing Kings might, without mole&s;tation, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, ruin, murder, or en&s;lave the whole race of men; overturn the &s;ettled forms of civil government, extirpate the chri&s;tain religion, and de&s;troy human &s;ociety at their plea&s;ure; this, and wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;i|ble, had been effected; nay, every &s;tate and kingdom, had been totally &s;ubverted long ago by the wor&s;t of mon&s;ters, lawle&s;s Prin|ces, had not this ju&s;t, natural, hereditary power of re&s;i&s;ting and oppo&s;ing their illegal violence (inherent in the people) re&s;trained and prevented &s;uch bloody and de&s;tructive de&s;igns from being carried into execution.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;ary and defen&s;ive oppo&s;ition, and re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t regal violence, which has ever been held lawful, and often practi&s;|ed in almo&s;t every kingdom, will ju&s;tify the Americans, in taking up arms and re&s;i&s;ting the pre&s;ent arbitrary, cruel, and bloody mea|&s;ures, now carrying on again&s;t them, by an infatuated, ob&s;tinate, perver&s;e King, his in|fernal mini&s;ters, and their agents, who&s;e only object in view is the entire ruin of this once
<PB N="117" REF="013979_0005_0F92596F42DED530">great, happy, powerful, and flouri&s;hing king|dom, and the de&s;truction of public liberty.</P>
<P>It is expre&s;sly declared by Ari&s;totle, Xeno|phon, King Edward the Confe&s;&s;or in his e&s;ta|bli&s;hed laws, the Council of Paris in 829, by Bracton, Forte&s;cue, and even King James him&s;elf, that a King governing in a &s;ettled kingdom, cea&s;es to be a King, and degene|rates into a tyrant, &s;o &s;oon as he leaves to rule by law, much more when he begins to in|vade his &s;ubjects per&s;ons, rights, liberties, to &s;et up an arbitrary power, impo&s;e unlawful taxes, rai&s;e forces, and make war upon his &s;ubjects, whom he &s;hould protect, and rule in peace; to pillage, plunder, wa&s;te, and &s;poil his kingdoms; impri&s;on, murder, and de&s;troy his people in an ho&s;tile manner; this they &s;everally declared to be the highe&s;t de|gree of tyranny, condemned and dete&s;ted by God and all good men. The whole &s;tate and kingdom therefore, in &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, for their own nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ervation, may law|fully, with force of arms, when no other means can &s;ecure them, not only pa&s;&s;ively but actively re&s;i&s;t their Prince, in &s;uch his violent and tyrannical proceedings; without re&s;i&s;ting any kingly lawful authority, for that is ve&s;ted in the King's per&s;on, for the pre|&s;ervation and not the de&s;truction of the king|dom; becau&s;e the illegal oppre&s;&s;ion and ty|rannical actions are not warranted, but pro|hibited by the laws of God, and the realm
<PB N="118" REF="013979_0006_0F9259704F555E88">(to whom he is accountable, and by whom he is ju&s;tly cen&s;urable) he is no lawful King, nor magi&s;trate, but an unju&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive ty|rant, a mere private man, who by &s;uch pro|ceedings hath denuded him&s;elf of his ju&s;t regal authority; &s;o that all tho&s;e laws made for the defence of the King's per&s;on and &s;o|vereign power, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of in&s;urrec|tions, trea&s;ons, and con&s;piracies again&s;t him, while he governs his people according to law, as by oath and duty he is bound, will yield on countenance, encouragement, or protection to him in &s;uch tyrannical and cruel oppre&s;|&s;ions, but more e&s;pecially when he turns a public enemy to his people, and proclaims open war again&s;t them; invades their laws, liberties and per&s;ons, and exerci&s;es all man|ner of ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, the &s;ame as the mo&s;t barbarous and foreign enemy would do; it being contrary to common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e that our laws, which &s;trictly inhibit and puni&s;h the very &s;malle&s;t violations of the public peace in all other per&s;ons, &s;hould countenance, ju&s;tify, and pa|tronize them in the King, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter, and &s;upreme fountain of ju&s;tice; and not permit the people, under pain of rebellion and trea&s;on, &s;o much as to defend their lives, li|berties, e&s;tates and religion, from the open violence of the King him&s;elf, or his malig|nant plundering mini&s;ters and favourites. When as Forte&s;cue and Bracton prove, Kings
<PB N="119" REF="013979_0007_0F925970EA896B68">of all others, both by oath and duty, ought to be more ob&s;ervant, and obedient to the laws of God and the land than the very meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>That precept of St. Paul, Romans xiii. 1, 2, 3, <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers,</HI> &amp;c. means no more than this, that as long as Kings legally and ju&s;tly execute the tru&s;t committed to their charge, and conferred on them by God and the peo|ple, they mu&s;t, and ought to be obeyed and &s;ubmitted to, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance pri|vate or public; but if they degenerate into tyrants, and turn profe&s;&s;ed enemies to their people, by murdering, impri&s;oning, or de|&s;troying them by open violence, or endea|vouring by force of arms, to &s;ubvert their laws, liberties or religion, and expo&s;e them as a prey to their mercile&s;s blood thir&s;ty &s;oldi|ers, I dare confidently to affirm, it was never the intention of St. Paul, much le&s;s of our laws, to inhibit &s;ubjects, under pain of dam|nation, high in con&s;cience, trea&s;on or rebel|lion, by defen&s;ive arms, to re&s;i&s;t Kings them|&s;elves or any of their mercenary adherents.</P>
<P>It was certainly never the intention of the Apo&s;tle, to e&s;tabli&s;h in the world any irri&s;i&s;|tible lawle&s;s tyranny, or &s;poil of kingdoms, and butchery of &s;ubjects, execrable to God and man in all ages, and in all per&s;ons who have re&s;i&s;ted them, even unto blood; he meant rather totally to &s;uppre&s;s them. There being &s;carce any more pregnant text again&s;t
<PB N="120" REF="013979_0008_0F925975A9967430">the tyranny, the boundle&s;s prerogative, the illegal proceedings of Kings, and the higher powers in all the &s;cripture, than that of Ro|mans xiii. 1&s;t to 7th ver&s;e, if properly under|&s;tood, and rightly interperted, as Pareus and others prove; therefore the re&s;i&s;tance of the Americans, again&s;t our pre&s;ent &s;educed, ma|lignant <HI>Popi&s;h King,</HI> is no violation of any law of God or the land, but a ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary war, which they have by every means, to the utmo&s;t of their power, endeavoured to prevent, and therefore no trea&s;on or rebel|lion within the meaning of any law or &s;tatute; they are only arming them&s;elves, for their own nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ervation, and to prevent their inevitable ruin, they mean not openly to a&s;&s;ault the royal army of butchers; and I believe there is no divine among the whole bench of Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, no ca&s;ui&s;t among the whole tribe of venal lawyers, except a few pro&s;tituted court &s;laves, villainous enough to affirm that it is damnation in con&s;cience, or trea&s;on and rebellion in point of law, for our injured and &s;uffering fellow &s;ubjects in America, to take up arms for the pre&s;ervation of their lives, their liberties, and their property, but would rather deem it ju&s;t and honorable, nay a duty for every Engli&s;hman to venture his life, and his fortune in their defence; in defence of the dear bought rights of his country, and rather than live a &s;lave, to die gloriou&s;ly in the cau&s;e of public liberty.</P>
