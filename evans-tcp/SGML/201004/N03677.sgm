<Q><BIBL><HI>ROMANS, VIII. 29, 30.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For whom he did fore-know, he al&s;o did pre|de&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the fir&s;t-born among many brethren.</P>
<P>Moreover, whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called; and whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified; and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE apo&s;tle having in the foregoing chapters of this epi&s;tle, explain'd the doct|rine of ju&s;tification, and pre&s;s'd the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;anctification, applies him|&s;elf in this to the con&s;olati|on of the Lord's people. For the holy
<PB N="2" REF="004497_0007_100D58DA19A5FAA0">&s;criptures are not only <HI>profitable for doctrine for reproof, for correction, and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but <HI>are written that we, thro' patience and comfort of them, might have hope:</HI> And the mini&s;ters of the word are appoint|ed to be <HI>helpers of the joy of them who thro' grace have believed.</HI> And, as a worthy Ex|po&s;itor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays of this chapter, many of the people of God have found it a well &s;pring of comfort to their &s;ouls, living and dying, and have &s;uck'd and been &s;atisfied from the&s;e brea&s;ts of con&s;olation, and <HI>with joy drawn water out of the&s;e wells of &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Having reckon'd up many particular in|&s;tances of the happine&s;s of true chri&s;tians, &s;uch as a freedom from guilt and condem|nation, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, a relation to God as his children, a title to future glory, and the concurrence of all providences to promote their &s;piritual and everla&s;ting good, he repre&s;ents the ground of all the&s;e as laid in God's eternal decree of Election, or Prede&s;tination unto life, in the words that I have read. <HI>For whom he did fore-know, them he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate,</HI> &amp;c. Here the order of the cau&s;es of our &s;alvation is plainly &s;et before us The&s;e words have been commonly call'd the golden chain of
<PB N="3" REF="004497_0008_100D58DBA14AE748">&s;alvation; and &s;uch a chain it is as cannot be broken. There are four links in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Whom he did fore-know, he al&s;o did pre|de&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.</HI> Whom he did <HI>fore-know.</HI> This is the foun|dation upon which the whole frame of the &s;urpri&s;ing work of man's redemption &s;tands; the fir&s;t thing to be con&s;ider'd in the &s;cheme of &s;alvation, upon which all the other parts follow, and with which they are in&s;epera|bly connected. It is here &s;aid of a num|ber of the children of men, as di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t, that God has fore-known them. And this fore-knowledge implies choice; his having pitch'd upon them to be the objects on whom his redeeming grace &s;hall be glorified. It is the &s;ame with that <HI>ever|la&s;ting love,</HI> wherewith he is &s;aid to have loved his people, Jer. 31.3. And means nothing le&s;s than his having <HI>&s;et them apart for him&s;elf,</HI> P&s;al. 4.3. Words of knowledge in &s;cripture often &s;ignifie affection and choice. So God &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Exod. 33.17 <HI>Thou ha&s;t found grace in my &s;ight, and I know thee by name.</HI> Where one expre&s;&s;ion explains the other. So the apo&s;tle tells us, 1 Cor. 8.3. That <HI>if any man love God, the &s;ame is known of him.</HI> A knowledge of &s;a|vour and good-will mu&s;t needs be here in|tended; and this previous and preparatory to any thing recommending and lovely in
<PB N="4" REF="004497_0009_100D58DEC8CB3C68">the objects of it; as is plain from the man|ner in which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks to the <HI>Ga|latians,</HI> ch 4. v. 9. <HI>Ye have known God, or rather are known of God</HI> On the other hand, we are told <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 7.23.</NOTE> our Saviour will &s;ay to &s;ome in the great day, <HI>I never knew you,</HI> i e. I never approv'd and own'd you; for both their per&s;ons and characters were well known to him. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Duplex Dei decretum ver&s;atur circa electos, quorum alterum appellat Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;telus <GAP DESC="foreign">; alterum <GAP DESC="foreign">, prede&s;tinationem, &s;ive electionem&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> autem <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ive proenotio, non e&s;t nudoe et &s;implicis not it oe, &s;ed approba|tionis, juxta u&s;itati&s;&s;imam &s;cripturae phra&s;io|logiam.</HI> Si quis diligit Deum, hic cognitus e&s;t ab eo. <HI>Ecquid cognitione nuda, &s;eclu&s;a appro|batione Dei?

Chri&s;t) <HI>was verily</HI> fore ordained <HI>before the foundation of the world, but was manife&s;t in the&s;e la&s;t times for you.</HI> God's fore-knowing his people means nothing le&s;s than his eternal purpo&s;e to make them his friends and favourites. It mu&s;t &s;ignifie his deter|mining
<PB N="5" REF="004497_0010_100D58E1837E8418">mining to do them good, to call, ju&s;tifie, and &s;anctifie them now, and glorifie them hereafter.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e whom God thus fore-knew, he did <HI>prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his &s;on;</HI> to be like to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the temper of their minds, and actions of their lives. This takes in the whole work of &s;anctification, of which Chri&s;t is the great pattern and &s;amplar. Ob&s;erve; It is not &s;aid God fore-knew they <HI>would</HI> be con|form'd to the image of his &s;on, and &s;o pre|de&s;tinated them, as &s;ome turn the &s;ence of the words. This cannot be the meaning of them; for this conformity to Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be the thing they are prede&s;tinated <HI>to,</HI> and is made the re&s;ult of this fore-knowledge; the effect of it, and not the cau&s;e. <HI>Whom he did foreknow, them he did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his &s;on.</HI> Being de&s;ign'd for glory and happine&s;s as the end, they are decreed to grace and holine&s;s as the way. For if there is a dif|ference between fore-knowledge and pre|de&s;tination, it &s;eems to be this, the former is the appointment of the end, the other of the means unto it. And they are pre|de&s;tinated to this conformity to the image of the &s;on of God, for the honour of Chri&s;t, who&s;e glory is de&s;ign'd by the Father in the whole work of redemption. <HI>That he might
<PB N="6" REF="004497_0011_100D58E3A6B4A548">be the fir&s;t born among many brethren;</HI> might have the honour of being the great pattern of holine&s;s, as well as the meritorious cau&s;e of our &s;alvation and &s;o in all things might have the preheminence.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o <HI>called.</HI> Not only with the external call; &s;o many are called, that were not cho&s;en <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> 12.16</NOTE>; but with the internal and effec|tual call; which is the work of the Spirit of God, whereby he convinces the con&s;ci|ence of guilt and wrath, enlightens the un|der&s;tanding in the knowledge of Chri&s;t; bows the will, and inclines the heart, to embrace him as a &s;aviour, and obey him as a king and lord. 'Tis, &s;ays one, an effec|tual call from &s;elf and earth, to God, and Chri&s;t, and heaven, as the end; from &s;in and vanity, to grace and holine&s;s, and &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, as the way." This is the fir&s;t open work of grace upon an elect per&s;on. And all whom God has from eternity pre|de&s;tinated to grace and glory, he does in his own way and time, thus effectually call.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whom he called, them he al&s;o <HI>ju&s;tified.</HI> Being in their effectual calling per&s;waded and enabled to embrace the Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="7" REF="004497_0012_100D58E5CFBC0BB0">Chri&s;t as he is offered in the go&s;pel, they are thro' him ab&s;olved from guilt, and ac|cepted as righteous; are no longer look'd upon and dealt with as criminals, but own'd and lov'd as friends and favourites.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o <HI>glorified.</HI> The other privileges the elect of God are made partakers of in time, this of glorification, when time &s;hall be with them no more; in the &s;oul fir&s;t at death, in &s;oul and body united after the re&s;urrection, through a ble&s;&s;ed never-ending eternity. To this they were de&s;ign'd in their electi|on; for this they are prepared by their effectual calling, and the &s;anctification of the &s;pirit; that which hindreth is taken out of the way in their ju&s;tification; and now, what can come between &s;uch a &s;oul and glory? <HI>As for God his work is perfect</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 18.30</NOTE>; and in the glorification of all the elect, his de&s;ign of love to them will have its full accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to &s;peak of all the&s;e privileges in the order in which they &s;tand connected in our text; and I have but lately di&s;cours'd concerning two of them, <HI>effectual calling</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tification.</HI> My pre&s;ent purpo&s;e therefore is, to treat only
<PB N="8" REF="004497_0013_100D58E7F0E0D910">of that which is the ground of them all, and from which the re&s;t re&s;ult, namely, <HI>Election,</HI> or <HI>Prede&s;tination unto life.</HI></P>
<P>This is an illu&s;trious and very precious doctrine of chri&s;tianity; &s;o plainly reveal'd in the holy &s;criptures, that 'tis really &s;trange that any who profe&s;s to regulate their faith by the <HI>bible</HI> can deny it. Yet 'tis not only deny'd by many, but decried and reproach'd as unworthy of God, and prejudicial to religion; while others who don't care to deny it, yet &s;peak of it as among&s;t tho&s;e my&s;terious, controver&s;ial, and &s;peculative points, which it is be&s;t not to meddle with; and &s;o they would have it &s;mother'd in the church, and &s;hut out of our &s;ermons.</P>
<P>True indeed this doctrine has its my&s;te|ries, and ab&s;tru&s;e difficulties, when our minds try to enter far into it; &s;o has other doctrines of the go&s;pel which yet we mu&s;t <HI>affirm con&s;tantly,</HI> and endeavour to explain. Nor is it a doctrine purely &s;peculative; no, it has a powerful influence upon vital re|ligion, and practical godline&s;s &mdash; It has a direct tendency to advance the glory of God's grace in our &s;alvation, to humble the pride of man, to engage the love, excite the prai&s;es, and con&s;train the obedience of God's children.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004497_0014_100D58EAF1CF8A88">
Our &s;aviour preach'd this doctrine; &s;o did his apo&s;tles after him; and the epi&s;tles to the churches are full of it; which plain|ly &s;hews God would not have it lock'd up from his people. Should we therefore, who now preach the go&s;pel to you, pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence, we &s;hould not be able to &s;ay we have <HI>declar'd</HI> to you <HI>the whole coun&s;el of God.</HI> I humbly apprehend &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion would be in effect to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles preach'd, and the &s;criptures reveal a doctrine, which is found to be u&s;ele&s;s if not hurtful, and therefore may not now be in&s;i&s;ted on. And would not this be to reproach the Holy Spirit who has indited the &s;criptures, and to do an un&s;peakable injury to revelation it &s;elf?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we are verily per&s;waded the edification and con&s;olation of the people of God, are not a little concern'd in the opening and applying of this truth; and that many other doctrines of the go&s;pel cannot be righly under&s;tood without it &mdash; I have therefore cho&s;en this for my &s;ubject, out of the chapter that has been read in cour&s;e this afternoon; &s;en&s;ible, I hope, that 'tis an awful and tremendous &s;ubject; and with an humble dependence on the Holy Spirit &s;o to enlighten and a&s;&s;i&s;t me, as that the truth may not &s;uffer, nor any &s;oul be hurt, thro' an unskilful management.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004497_0015_100D58EC77766CE0">
Indeed, let the &s;ubject be managed never &s;o cautiou&s;ly &amp; &s;cripturally, it can hardly be expected but it will be treated as the di&s;cour&s;es of the apo&s;tle him&s;elf were, of whom we read, Acts 19.8, 9. That when <HI>he went into the &s;ynagogue, and &s;pake boldly for the &s;pace of three months, di&s;puting and per&s;wa|ding the things concerning the kingdom of God, divers were hardned, and believed not, but &s;pake evil of that way before the multitude.</HI> But duty is ours, and the event God's. We mu&s;t always leave the &s;ucce&s;s of our preach|ing with him; and we are a&s;&s;ured his word will <HI>not return void,</HI> but <HI>will accompli&s;h the thing whereunto it is &s;ent</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a, 55.11.</NOTE> If any &s;hould be enrag'd and hardn'd by the things that are &s;poken, and <HI>wre&s;t</HI> them to their own de|&s;truction, (which God forbid!) &s;ome, I tru&s;t, may be confirm'd, edified, and com|forted. Yea, po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es on election, may be ble&s;s'd for the conver&s;ion of &s;ome of the elect of God, who may be awakned hereby to <HI>give diligence to make their calling and election &s;ure:</HI> And if &s;o, free grace will have the glory.</P>
<P>Tho' I &s;hall &s;tudy as much brevity as is con&s;i&s;tent with clearne&s;s, yet I can't pro|&s;ecute my de&s;ign within the compa&s;s of a
<PB N="11" REF="004497_0016_100D58EE01CD9FC8">&s;ingle &s;ermon; three or four di&s;cour&s;es, if God give us the opportunity for them, will be little eno' for my purpo&s;e And now, my Hearers, let me crave, and, as I &s;peak in the name of Chri&s;t, I may demand your reverend and &s;erious attention. Let me entreat you to lay a&s;ide prejudices, if you have entertain'd any, again&s;t this doctrine, and to <HI>receive with meekne&s;s the engrafted word which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls.</HI> Let me de|&s;ire you to &s;top all cen&s;ures till I have fi|ni&s;h'd the &s;ubject, if, thro' the good hand of our God upon us, I may be allowed to do &s;o. And let me further ask you, before I proceed, to lift up your heart to God, in &s;ome &s;uch &s;ecret petition as this, "Lord! If this doctrine be according to thy mind and will, &s;uffer not my mind to be preju|diced again&s;t it; but help me to receive it in the love of it, and to improve it to all tho&s;e holy &s;aving purpo&s;es for which thou ha&s;t reveal'd it in thy word!" If any will not do thus, let me tell them, their minds are not rightly di&s;pos'd to hear, nor can they be look'd upon to be &s;incere enquirers after truth.</P>
<P>And now the method in which, thro' divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I would pur&s;ue the &s;ub|ject is this,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="004497_0017_100D58F036E665C8">
I. I would repre&s;ent and &s;tate the truth, to &s;hew you what we intend by the doctrine of Election, or Prede&s;tination unto life.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will endeavour to prove it, and &s;hew that the doctrine &s;o repre&s;ented and &s;tated, is really the doctrine of the go&s;pel.</P>

<P>_THERE is an excellent and mo&s;t wi&s;e order and con|nection in all that God brings to pa&s;s; and this order &s;o &s;ettled and join'd together, that it can never be broken. The &s;alvation of any of the children of fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> takes its ri&s;e in the eternal coun&s;el, free purpo&s;e, and electing love of God. Whom
<PB N="29" REF="004497_0034_100D591A11B07140">he did <HI>fore-know,</HI> and per&s;onally chu&s;e to &s;alvation, them he did <HI>prede&s;tinate</HI> to all the means which lead to that &s;alva|tion. That which fir&s;t follows prede&s;ti|nation is <HI>effectual calling:</HI> Whom he did prede&s;tinate, &s;ays the text, <HI>them he al&s;o called.</HI> In his appointed time, by his word and &s;pirit, he powerfully draws the&s;e to a thankful acceptance of, and firm reliance on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as their &s;aviour, and an obedient <HI>walking in him</HI> as the way to eternal life. Upon this en&s;ues their <HI>ju&s;tification:</HI> Whom he called, <HI>them he al&s;o ju&s;tified.</HI> Being united to Chri&s;t in their effectual calling, they are thro' him ab&s;olv'd from guilt, and accepted as righteous.

<P>It was not my de&s;ign, when I began up|on the&s;e words the la&s;t Lords-day, to &s;peak of all the&s;e privileges in the order in which
<PB N="30" REF="004497_0035_100D591B97A00CC8">the text pre&s;ents them; but only of that which is the ground of them all, and from which the re&s;t re&s;ult, namely, <HI>Election,</HI> or <HI>Prede&s;tination unto life;</HI> a plain and precious, but di&s;reli&s;h'd and oppos'd truth of the go&s;|pel. That I have taken this in hand, I'm &s;ure is not from a love to controver&s;y, or fondne&s;s to oppo&s;e the &s;chemes of others, but, I hope, from a &s;incere de&s;ire to <HI>fulfill the mini&s;try of the Lord Je&s;us</HI> which I have receiv'd among you, by te&s;tifying <HI>the go&s;pel of the grace of God</HI> in all the parts of it. We tru&s;t, my Brethren, that we aim to &s;peak, <HI>not as plea&s;ing men, but God;</HI> and there|fore we dare not baulk any truth, in its proper place and &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e 'tis un|fa&s;hionable, oppos'd by <HI>the wi&s;dom of the world,</HI> or run down by popular outcry. Nor am I determin'd to this opinion by the prejudice of education, but becau&s;e after careful &s;earches and re&s;earches, I am convinc'd of the truth of it, upon what appears to me to be the &s;tronge&s;t evidence; and the more I enquire into it, the more I &s;ee it to agree with the holy &s;criptures, and the divine perfections.</P>
<P>It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the former di&s;cour&s;e to explain and &s;tate the truth under con|&s;ideration. That which we are next to proceed to is to <HI>prove</HI> and <HI>confirm</HI> it. The point then to be now e&s;tabli&s;h'd is this,
<PB N="31" REF="004497_0036_100D591D415CB1A0">"That a certain, great and glorious num|ber, were elected by God, in his eternal coun&s;el and purpo&s;e, from the re&s;t of fallen mankind, to be in time effectually called and ju&s;tified, in order to their being finally bro't to eternal life and glory; and this out of his meer good plea&s;ure, and for the prai&s;e of his glorious grace." And if the truth of this is once evinced to the con|viction of a &s;ober, hone&s;t, and &s;erious mind, it may be hop'd all di&s;gu&s;t at it will cea&s;e, and every thought that <HI>exalts it &s;elf</HI> again&s;t it will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>Let me prepare the way to the more direct and po&s;itive proof I &s;hall fetch from the <HI>bible,</HI> by fir&s;t of all pre&s;enting you with &s;ome &s;cripture in&s;tances of a <HI>lower election,</HI> of God's chu&s;ing and prede&s;tinating certain per&s;ons by name, and &s;ome of them long before they were born, to &s;ome &s;pecial privileges, high honours, and &s;ignal &s;ervi|ces

And if the&s;e may'nt be taken for po&s;itive proof of that election we are treating of, yet they will &s;erve greatly to illu&s;trate it, and they are by very judicious Divines look'd upon as ex|amples and patterns of it, ina&s;much as they plainly &s;hew that the glorious God does act with re&s;pect to the children of men, with a &s;overeign liberty, and in a way of di&s;criminating favour; yea, many of them were in&s;tances of the <HI>very election</HI> we are now to exhibit the proof of, ina&s;much as it plainly appears by the account the &s;cripture gives of them, that at the &s;ame time they were called to tho&s;e external privileges and temporal honours to which they were cho&s;en, they were al&s;o called to the &s;piritual and &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace.</P>

For, if every creature derives its being from God, as the fir&s;t cau&s;e, then no creature can po&s;&s;ibly be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any excellency, but what mu&s;t, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;o|lute &s;en&s;e, belong to God &mdash; Now, no one can deny that it is an excellency in any creature to be wi&s;e and powerful; wi&s;e to lay a &s;cheme of what he intends to do and powerful to perform and ac|compli&s;h what he de&s;igns. For a rational being to &s;et about a work, without fir&s;t forming in his mind a <HI>model</HI> of what he intends to pur&s;ue, is to di&s;cover a defect of wi&s;dom; as not to be able to accompli&s;h the plan he hath laid down, bewrays a want of power. &mdash; The&s;e premi&s;es being granted which indeed cannot be denied, it mu&s;t follow, that whatever the great God does he de&s;ign'd to do; and whatever he de&s;ign'd to do he does.

And how &s;hall they hear without a preacher?</HI> Now, the go&s;|pel of &s;alvation is &s;ent to &s;ome places, and not to others; and this by a <HI>&s;pecial provi|dence.</HI> Not only the doctrine, but the <HI>journeys</HI> and <HI>travels</HI> of the apo&s;tles, were under the direction of the &s;pirit of God. Acts 16.6, 7 <HI>Now when they were gone throughout</HI> Phrygia, <HI>and the region of</HI> Galatia, <HI>and were forbidden of the Holy Gho&s;t to preach the word in</HI> A&s;ia, <HI>after they were come to</HI> My&s;ia, <HI>they a&s;&s;ayed to go into</HI> Bithynia: <HI>but the &s;pirit &s;uffered them not.</HI> Agreably when the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was preaching the go&s;pel at <HI>Antioch,</HI> he told the people of that place (Acts, 13.26.) <HI>Men and brethren, to you is the word of

And this di&s;po&s;ition of providence cannot be accounted for but by an election of grace to be gather'd in from among &s;uch a people. This was given as the rea&s;on why <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;ent to preach the go&s;pel at <HI>Corinth,</HI> Acts 18.9, 10. <HI>Then &s;pake the Lord to</HI> Paul <HI>in the night by a vi&s;ion, &s;aying, Be not afraid, but &s;peak, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man &s;hall hurt thee; for I</HI> HAVE MUCH PEOPLE <HI>in this city.</HI> And &s;o the preaching of the go&s;pel in other <HI>Gentile</HI> places is accounted for, Acts 15.14.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">IV.

This could no ways be <HI>a&s;certain'd</HI> but by a di|vine fore-ordination; for otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t be left to turn upon the corrupt fallacious will of man.

<P>_THESE words have been the foundation of two di&s;|cour&s;es already, upon this illu&s;trious Doctrine of chri&s;|tianity, That a certain num|ber were &s;elected by God, in his eternal coun&s;el and purpo&s;e, from the re&s;t of fallen mankind, to be in time effectually called, &s;anctified and ju&s;tified, in order to their being finally bro't to eternal life and glory; and this out of his meer good plea&s;ure, and for the prai&s;e of his glorious grace.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="004497_0080_100D597F65E98548">
This truth has been explained &amp; &s;tated in &s;everal propo&s;itions. It has al&s;o been confirmed &amp; e&s;tabli&s;hed by po&s;itive &s;crip|ture proof, and by &s;ome arguments drawn from the &s;criptures. That which we are to proceed to at this time is,</P>
<P N="3">III. To attempt to clear this truth of &s;ome <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entations</HI> made of it; and to give an an&s;wer to the <HI>objections</HI> commonly bro't again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Here I would fir&s;t of all ob&s;erve to you, We &s;hou'd not di&s;own or relinqui&s;h a doc|trine we have been taught, becau&s;e of &s;ome objections rais'd again&s;t it, or difficulties attending it. For there is no one truth in all the <HI>bible,</HI> tho' never &s;o plainly laid down, but the corrupt, proud, and a&s;piring mind of man, has formed &s;ome objections again&s;t it, and &s;tarted &s;ome difficulties a|bout it. And if we can't quite ma&s;ter all the difficulties, and reconcile every thing that &s;eems contradictory, we mu&s;t not therefore withold our a&s;&s;ent, if the thing it &s;elf is expre&s;ly reveal'd in &s;cripture, or nece&s;tarily in&s;er'd from it. We are indi&s;|pen&s;ably obliged to believe whatever God has reveal'd, whether it is obvious to our rea&s;on, and agrees with our preconceiv'd opinions, or not. If we can but &s;atisfie
<PB N="76" REF="004497_0081_100D5980ED1BA350">our &s;elves the &s;cripture a&s;&s;erts &s;uch a doc|trine, the ob&s;curity, difficulty, and har&s;h|ne&s;s, which &s;eem to attend it, mu&s;t not &s;tumble or offend us. For the&s;e are things which are to be receiv'd upon the credit of him that reveals them; and we don't yield that <HI>obedience of faith</HI> which the go&s;|pel requires, unle&s;s our <HI>under&s;tandings</HI> &s;ubmit to a revealed truth, as readily as our <HI>wills</HI> are to comply with a commanded duty.</P>
<P>It is &s;cripture and not rea&s;on, that is the rule of faith: For we are incompetent judges of revealed truths, not only on ac|count of the narrowne&s;s of our capacities, but becau&s;e of that <HI>blindne&s;s of mind</HI> which is the con&s;equent of our fallen &s;tate.</P>
<P>Nor yet is the un&s;earchablene&s;s of a doctrine reveal'd in &s;cripture, a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we &s;hould forbear all <HI>inquiry into it,</HI> or <HI>di&s;cour&s;e about it.</HI> What we may not pretend to &s;earch out to perfection, or to explain the <HI>modus</HI> of, we may yet know and &s;peak &s;o much of, as to &s;ub&s;erve the great ends of religion. And if it is not the object of inquiry, nor a &s;it &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, to what end is it reveal'd at all? We are &s;oon lo&s;t in the <HI>perfections of the divine nature,</HI> as well as in the <HI>doctrine of the decrees;</HI> yet <HI>they</HI> mu&s;t not be let alone,
<PB N="77" REF="004497_0082_100D598272EC4528">if we would teach people what they are to believe concerning God.</P>
<P>Tho' there are bounds &s;et about the holy mount, and to <HI>break thro' to gaze,</HI> is danger|ous, and may be fatal; yet, keeping a pro|per di&s;tance, we may allowably take a view of what is pre&s;ented before us; and with|out affecting to be <HI>wi&s;e above what is writ|ten,</HI> we may &s;afely venture to go into a my&s;|terious &s;ubject as far as the &s;cripture leads us, <HI>compareing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual:</HI> And by going <HI>into the &s;anctuary of God,</HI> we may gain &s;ome &s;atisfaction about what is otherwi&s;e <HI>two painful</HI> for us.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this by way of premi&s;e, I come directly to what we propos'd, to vindicate the pre&s;ent truth from &s;ome of the mi&s;repre&s;entations made of it, and to an&s;wer &s;ome objections made again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="1">1. To vindicate it from &s;ome <HI>mi&s;repre|&s;entations</HI> For di&s;tinction is always to be made between the objections to which a truth may be liable, and the mi&s;repre&s;en|tations which are ignorantly or maliciou&s;ly made of it. Some greatly mi&s;repre&s;ent this doctrine, and &s;tate it in &s;uch a manner as we are far from allowing, but utterly di&s;own and reject as well as them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="004497_0083_100D5985DF1561D8">
Thus,</P>
<P N="1">1. Some repre&s;ent the doctrine of elec|tion as God's ordaining to &s;ave &s;ome par|ticular per&s;ons <HI>let them live how they will.</HI></P>
<P>But no &s;uch election as this was ever a&s;&s;erted by <HI>us.</HI> The &s;cripture knows no &s;uch election. and <HI>we</HI> are far from main|taining it. The &s;ame decree that de&s;igns any per&s;ons to &s;alvation, a&s;certains the means for the obtaining that &s;alvation: The&s;e are faith and holine&s;s. God hath cho&s;en us to &s;alvation <HI>thro' &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth.</HI> And the elect of God <HI>are prede&s;tinated to be conformed to the image of his &s;on,</HI> which takes in the whole work of &s;anctification. And there|fore we never &s;aid, that if a per&s;on was elected he might be &s;aved however he or|dered his life; for this wou'd be to &s;eparate what God has indi&s;&s;olubly connected, and to de&s;troy a part of the decree it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another mi&s;repre&s;entation is, when any &s;peak as if the decree of God was <HI>the Rea&s;on why men did continue in &s;in &amp; unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave to reply to this in the words of another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Ridgley,</HI> by way of reply to Dr. <HI>Whitby.</HI> See his body of divinity, Vol. 1&s;t p. 230.</NOTE> <Q>Indeed, the imme|diate
<PB N="79" REF="004497_0084_100D598764F17560">rea&s;on why any repent and believe to eternal life, is becau&s;e the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power is exercis'd to|wards them, whereby he works repent|ance and faith in them; and the rea&s;on of his exerting this power to work the&s;e &s;aving graces in them, is becau&s;e he has determined to do it; and &s;o 'tis the execution of his purpo&s;e. But it does not follow from hence, that the rea&s;on why others do not repent &amp; believe is, be|cau&s;e they were not ordain'd to eternal life. Tis true, their not being ordain'd to eternal life, or God's not having pur|po&s;ed to &s;ave them, is the rea&s;on why he does not exert that power which is nece&s;&s;ary to work repentance and faith in them; and impenitence and unbelief will certainly be the con&s;equent hereof; but the immediate &s;pring and cau&s;e of impenitence and unbelief, is the corrup|tion and perver&s;ene&s;s of human nature, which is chargable on none but man him&s;elf. We mu&s;t certainly di&s;tingui&s;h between impenitence and unbelief their being the <HI>con&s;equent</HI> of God's not work|ing repentance and faith, and its being the <HI>effect</HI> hereof. If God withholds his grace from &s;ome to whom he was not oblig'd to give it, and they continue in &s;in, this is to be a&s;&s;ign'd only to that
<PB N="80" REF="004497_0085_100D5989ED726A28">wicked propen&s;ity of nature, which in|clines us to &s;in, and not to the divine efficiency;</Q> for the decree enforces no man to &s;in, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another &s;uch gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation of this doctrine is, when any &s;peak as if the a&s;&s;ertors of it held, that men are damn'd <HI>by vertus of the decree,</HI> without any con&s;ide|ration of their <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>mi&s;carriages.</HI></P>
<P>But this was never &s;aid by the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;ertors of election and reproba|tion. We do indeed affirm that God of his meer &s;overeignty cho&s;e &s;ome to ever|la&s;ting life, and pa&s;&s;ed by others, without any con&s;ideration had to the good works of the former, or the evil deeds of the lat|ter; but then a di&s;tinction is made be|tween bare <HI>non-electing,</HI> and the <HI>decree of con|demnation. This,</HI> being a thing more po&s;i|tive in the nature of it, mu&s;t be with a view to &s;in committed, and from the fore|&s;ight of it. The objects of the decree of condemnation mu&s;t be &s;ome way or other, obnoxious to ju&s;tice, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God may be intirely clear in the judg|ment of intellectual creatures. For, tho' a favour may be placed on one to whom 'tis not due, while it is withheld from
<PB N="81" REF="004497_0086_100D598C1A3F6FC8">another that has no claim to it, without any &s;hadow of inju&s;tice; yet, puni&s;hment can't righteou&s;ly be inflicted on one that no way de&s;erves it; and eternal puni&s;h|ment cannot be de&s;erved, if no &s;in is to be charged.</P>
<P>Among the Calvini&s;tical Divines of the la&s;t century, Doctor <HI>Twi&s;s</HI> was one of prime note; and, tho' in the <HI>&s;upra-lap&s;arian &s;cheme,</HI> he declares him&s;elf in the words following; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>riches of God's love,</HI> wrote again&s;t Mr. <HI>Hord,</HI> 2d part pag. 50.</NOTE> <Q>That in no moment of time or rea&s;on doth God ordain any man to damnation, before the con|&s;ideration of &s;in. Every one that is dam|ned is damned for his &s;in, and that will|fully committed, and contumaciou&s;ly continued, by them that come to ripe years.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Edwards,</HI> another &s;trenuous and learned defender of prede&s;tination, &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>Veritas Redux,</HI> p 163, 164.</NOTE> <Q>It is a true propo&s;ition, that God never decreed to make any creature everla&s;t|ingly mi&s;erable, who by his voluntary
<PB N="82" REF="004497_0087_100D598F74A39DD0">tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the divine laws, did not de&s;erve it. To damn, being an act of punitive ju&s;tice, &s;uppo&s;es a fault, implies &s;ome demerit. <HI>Tribulation and angui&s;h to every &s;oul of man that worketh evil,</HI> Rom. 2.9. <HI>All are under &s;in,</HI> Rom. 3.9. <HI>That every month may be &s;topped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</HI> v. 19. There|fore the penal decree hath re&s;pect to this.</Q></P>
<P>And our venerable <HI>Willard</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>Expo&s;itory Lectures,</HI> p. 270.</NOTE> &s;peaks the &s;ame language, when he &s;ays, <Q>God in|tended to damn none but for &s;in. Dam|nation is not an act of meer &s;overeignty, but of relative ju&s;tice. God damns none meerly becau&s;e he will damn them, but becau&s;e they have bro't it upon them|&s;elves. As in Jer. 2.17. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not procured this unto thy &s;elf, in that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God?</HI> Sin therefore is the only cau&s;e of men's de&s;truction. It is true, there is an infallibility of con|&s;equence upon reprobation, that all who are under that decree will die; but they do not die becau&s;e they were reprobated, but becau&s;e they &s;inned. And were it not &s;o, revenging ju&s;tice would not be manife&s;ted in this. For, ju&s;tice appears
<PB N="83" REF="004497_0088_100D59919E335E78">in rewarding men according to their doings, judging by the law which they are under. That ju&s;tice then may take place, it mu&s;t appear that the man really de&s;erves the penalty in|flicted on him Now this de&s;ert ari&s;eth from the nature and merit of &s;in: the man then mu&s;t be a &s;inner before he can be ju&s;tly damned; and if he be &s;o, he then rightly de&s;erves it. So we read, Rom. 6.23. <HI>The wages of &s;in is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> So that notwith&s;tanding the decree, no one falls under this &s;en|tence, till by his &s;in he hath brought it upon him&s;elf. No man is doom'd to hell and de&s;truction, becau&s;e he was re|probated, but becau&s;e he was a &s;inner and de&s;erv'd it</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;o far clear'd the doctrine of the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations that are made of it,</P>
<P>We come,</P>
<P N="2">II To return &s;ome an&s;wer to the <HI>ob|jections</HI> that are commonly offer'd again&s;t it.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="1">1. Some object again&s;t the doctrine of election, or God's free choice of &s;ome of fallen mankind, to make them the &s;ub|jects of his grace now, and heirs of glory hereafter, while he pa&s;&s;ed by the re&s;t, and left them in the ruins of their apo&s;tacy; &s;ome
<PB N="84" REF="004497_0089_100D599409F2FF40">object again&s;t this, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of God. Why, &s;ay they, &s;hou'd he chu&s;e &s;ome and not others, to make them the objects of his redeeming love and grace, when all were alike mi&s;er|able, and equally unde&s;erving? Does not this make him a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons? Whenas we are told, Acts 10.34. <HI>Of a truth God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons;</HI> and he has &s;trictly forbidden this in <HI>earthly judges.</HI></P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wer'd, That re&s;pect of per&s;ons which is blam'd among&s;t men, is when one is prefer'd before another, in a matter of <HI>right,</HI> for &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter and &s;elf|i&s;h ends; as when a judge <HI>favours the rich in his cau&s;e:</HI> but this is not chargeable where a per&s;on is under no obligation by any law or rule, but is at perfect liberty. Thus tho' a man that is a judge, mu&s;t do alike by all, when he di&s;pen&s;es ju&s;tice; yet a man is at liberty to take into his hou&s;e and family whom he plea&s;es, or to be&s;tow his e&s;tate on whom he will. If that place in Acts 10.34.35. where the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Of a truth I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him,</HI> is duly con&s;ider'd, it will appear that it does not intend but that God does &s;hew favour to &s;ome above
<PB N="85" REF="004497_0090_100D599653786BB8">others; but all that it means is this, that God re&s;pects no man's per&s;on, either le&s;s or more, for his <HI>outward condition &amp; carnal priviledges.</HI></P>
<P>Now, it is certain that God's election had no regard to any thing in the creature, to any de&s;ervings found in the objects of it; for all lay in one corrupt ma&s;s when the decree was exercis'd about them, and what|ever they have excellent above others is the fruit of their election, and &s;o not the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The glorious God was at perfect liberty, being a debtor to none He is &s;overeign Lord of his own grace, and may certainly be&s;tow it where he will. None could lay claim to it, and therefore none are wrong'd if it is not be&s;towed on them; tho' all are highly favour'd who are the partakers of it.</P>
<P>Shall it be reckon'd an act of inju&s;tice in God to &s;ave &s;ome of mankind only, when he might have left ALL to peri&s;h, as well as the fallen angels, and not recover'd &s;o much as ONE of our apo&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ace?

<P N="2">2. This truth is further objected again&s;t as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> of God. They &s;ay, <HI>God's tender mer|cies are over all his works;</HI> that he is repre|&s;ented in &s;cripture as a great lover of man|kind, and as having <HI>no plea&s;ure in the death of a &s;inner</HI> but a de&s;ire that he &s;hould <HI>live.</HI> How then can it be that his &s;aving de&s;ign is re&s;train'd to any determinate number, while the re&s;t are left to peri&s;h everla&s;ting|ly? And &s;ome are ready to think and &s;ay, what is even horrible to repeat, that it taxes a merciful God with the cruelty of making man to damn him.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>However great the goodne&s;s and mercy of God are, yet all his creatures in mi&s;ery do not equally partake in them. This is plain from the di&s;tinction that is made be|tween the fallen angels and fallen mankind. The fallen angels are wholly pa&s;s'd by, and not one of them &s;aved; and this to be &s;ure, without any derogation to the mercy of God. Yet there is as much rea&s;on to charge God with want of goodne&s;s and
<PB N="87" REF="004497_0092_100D5999F2B8A650">mercy, in leaving all the fallen angels to peri&s;h, as in pa&s;&s;ing by &s;ome of fallen mankind. Or will any pre&s;ume to affirm that God is unmerciful, becau&s;e he choo&s;es the objects of his mercy, or <HI>has mercy on whom he will have mercy?</HI> The <HI>power</HI> of God is limited and determin'd in the exer|ci&s;e of it, by his divine wi&s;dom and &s;over|eign plea&s;ure; and why &s;hould not his <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> be &s;o too?</P>
<P>Nor does this give occa&s;ion for that in|jurious and bla&s;phemous reflection, that God made &s;ome men to DAMN them. For God's purpo&s;e to condemn men, does not con&s;ider them as <HI>creatures,</HI> but as <HI>&s;inners;</HI> as we have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve already. That God did not create man on purpo&s;e that he might &s;in, is evident from man's primitive &s;tate, that of innocence, in which he might have continued. For tho' his creator made him <HI>mutable,</HI> he yet made him <HI>upright</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle. 7.29.</NOTE>, without the lea&s;t tincture of &s;in in his nature, or any di&s;po&s;ition, or inclination to it; but all the powers and faculties of the &s;oul were di&s;pos'd to an|&s;wer the ends of its creation, and thereby to glorifie God. Now, as God did not
<PB N="88" REF="004497_0093_100D599B78836070">create man that he might &s;in, he cannot be &s;aid to create him that he might con|demn him: <Q>Several other ideas inter|vene between God's purpo&s;e to create and to condemn.</Q></P>
<P>And tho' the merciful God does not take plea&s;ure in the death of a &s;inner, as 'tis the mi&s;ery of his creatures, yet he has, <HI>and from the perfection of his nature cannot but have,</HI> a high &s;atisfaction in the di&s;play of his own ju&s;tice towards &s;ome, who&s;e &s;in has render'd them the proper objects for that terrible attribute to be glorified upon. Be&s;ides, the&s;e &s;ame objections taken from the good|ne&s;s and mercy of God, lie as much again&s;t God's not eventually &s;aving all, as his de|termination not to &s;ave all. None &s;ay that all men will be <HI>finally</HI> &s;aved; for the &s;cripture declares the contrary in many places. Yet 'tis certain, God cou'd &s;ave all men if he &s;o plea&s;ed. He cou'd change the heart of every &s;inner in the world, prepare him for &s;alvation, and then be&s;tow it on him. Is it any derogation to his goodne&s;s and mercy that he don't do thus? Why then do any charge the opinion of God's determining to &s;ave but a part of mankind, with &s;uch unmercifulne&s;s, when the objection lies full as &s;trong again&s;t their own opinion, that God will <HI>actually &s;ave but a part</HI> of our &s;pecies?</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="004497_0094_100D599DEAD39F80">
Nor do we by this opinion make &s;alva|tion narrower, or more confin'd, than tho&s;e who oppo&s;e it; but, in fact, make it as ex|ten&s;ive in its &s;ubjects as they do. As one has well ob&s;erv'd upon this argument, <Q>The difference between them and us, is not about the number that are &s;av'd; we both agree in this, that none &s;hall be &s;av'd but &s;uch as repent and believe, and obey the go&s;pel, and that all &s;uch &s;hall certainly be &s;aved; but what we differ about is, the manner of their obtaining &s;alvation. We &s;ay, they are &s;av'd by virtue of the electing love of God; they &s;ay they are &s;av'd becau&s;e they rightly improve their own free will. We affirm them to be &s;av'd in &s;uch a way as a&s;cribes all to the glory of God; the way of &s;al|vation which they hold is &s;uch, as leaves great room for man to glory. Thus far then our doctrine appears every whit as merciful to mankind as theirs, ina&s;much as the difference is not about the num|ber of the &s;av'd, but the way and man|ner of their coming to this &s;alvation. Nay, our doctrine appears much <HI>more merciful</HI> than theirs who oppo&s;e it. For ours makes the &s;alvation of millions of the fallen children of men <HI>ab&s;olutely cer|tain,</HI> while theirs makes the &s;alvation of any man, but <HI>barely po&s;&s;ible</HI> And let any
<PB N="90" REF="004497_0095_100D59A14C2BAD48">unprejudic'd per&s;on judge, whether a doctrine that &s;ecures the &s;alvation of an innumerable multitude, is not more worthy of a compa&s;&s;ionate and merciful God, than a notion that only puts the &s;alvation of every one upon a bare po&s;|&s;ibility, whence it may happen, that even according to their own tenets, no one may be &s;av'd at la&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Nay the author we here refer to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sladen.</HI></NOTE> car|ries the matter &s;till higher, and with good rea&s;on a&s;&s;erts, <Q>That the doctrine of our <HI>opponents is an unmerciful doctrine,</HI> becau&s;e it is &s;o far from a&s;certaining the &s;alvati|on of any, that it makes the &s;alvation of each man <HI>a moral impo&s;&s;ibility.</HI> They &s;uppo&s;e the election the &s;cripture &s;peaks of to be only a conditional one, i. e. provided men will repent and believe, and per&s;evere in holine&s;s; but they will not allow that God has prede&s;tinated any <HI>to</HI> faith, repentance, and per&s;everance to the end; but that the performance of the&s;e conditions depends upon their own will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if this is the ca&s;e, the que&s;tion which was once put to our Lord, may
<PB N="91" REF="004497_0096_100D59A2D23DDC60">very properly be ask'd here, <HI>Who then can be &s;aved?</HI> For, if the &s;cripture has rightly repre&s;ented men as by nature in a &s;tate of <HI>death,</HI> to <HI>every good work repro|bate; not &s;ufficient as of them&s;elves</HI> to &s;peak a good <HI>word,</HI> or think a good <HI>tho't,</HI> how is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hou'd by their own innate power ever perform the&s;e great and weighty conditions?</Q></P>
<P>Thus our doctrine appears to be not only con&s;i&s;tent with the mercy of God, but to give it a brighter di&s;play. And I would only add upon this; It is the <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> which I &s;ee &s;hining forth in this doc|trine, that makes me embrace it, and prize it, and contend for it. And however others may judge, I declare with all &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, I wou'd not for ten thou&s;and worlds but my own &s;alvation &s;hou'd &s;tand more &s;ecure, than any will or power of my own is able to make it.</P>
<P>To go on.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is objected again&s;t the truth we are maintaining, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>human liberty,</HI> and tends to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>fatal nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of things. Some will &s;ay, if men are prede&s;tinated to faith and holine&s;s, a force is then put upon their inclinations, and a free choice taken away: As on the other hand they &s;ay, this brings men under
<PB N="92" REF="004497_0097_100D59CC8E2477D8">a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;mning; and why are they to be blam'd or puni&s;h'd for what they cannot help? Nay, &s;ome will venture &s;o far as to &s;ay, that upon this principle God him&s;elf mu&s;t be the author of &s;in, or the blameable cau&s;e of evil.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, To reconcile the divine fore-ordination with human liberty, is a thing too hard for us; nor may any one pretend to do it. Yet <HI>the matter of fact is certain,</HI> that men do act with liberty and freedom in things that are fore-ordained. And tho' <HI>we</HI> can't reconcile them, there is certainly an agreement between the&s;e two. Nor is it more difficult to reconcile this, than &s;ome other things which yet are ge|nerally own'd. As for in&s;tance, the duty and &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>prayer</HI> with the doctrine of God's <HI>unchangeablene&s;s.</HI> Such is the per|fection of God's nature that he is unchange|able in his mind and purpo&s;es. When he is &s;aid in &s;cripture to repent or change his mind, 'tis only &s;poken after the manner of men; and can by no means be under&s;tood as if he had alter'd his purpo&s;e upon any <HI>new pro&s;pect,</HI> or was bro't to do otherwi&s;e than he before de&s;ign'd; for this wou'd plainly be to derogate from the perfection of his nature. Yet <HI>prayer</HI> is the appointed means of receiving mercy and ble&s;&s;ings
<PB N="93" REF="004497_0098_100D30F563E8CB78">from God, and he does many things for his people in an&s;wer to their prayers, and has <HI>never &s;aid to the &s;eed of</HI> Jacob, <HI>&s;eek ye me in vain.</HI> Now I &s;ay, 'tis no more difficult to reconcile the divine fore ordination with human liberty, than it is the doctrine of the divine unchangeablene&s;s with the efficacy of prayer. And &s;o there is no more rea&s;on to reject the doctrine of the <HI>divine decrees,</HI> than there is the doctrine of the <HI>divine unchangablene&s;s,</HI> which even rea|&s;on teaches.</P>
<P>Tho' the elect of God are prede&s;tinated to faith and holine&s;s, no violence is offer'd to their wills when they come to believe in Chri&s;t, and chu&s;e the way of holine&s;s. Tho' all that the father hath given him, &s;hall come to Chri&s;t, yet they come freely, not by a <HI>force upon</HI> their wills, but <HI>a change</HI> in them. Surely God may incline the wills of men, without de&s;troying the na|ture and freedom of them. So we road, <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power,</HI> P&s;al. 110 3. And God tells his people, <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting love; therefore with loving kindne&s;s have I drawn thee.</HI> And the church prays, <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee,</HI> Cant. 1 4. On the other hand, Tho' the decree of God leaves &s;ome unto the &s;infulne&s;s of their own hearts and lives, out of which he is
<PB N="94" REF="004497_0099_100D59A5D1508E60">under no obligation to recover them, yet this enforces no man to &s;in; but men's &s;in is always voluntary and cho&s;en. So 'tis &s;aid of God's &s;inful people of old, I&s;ai. 66.3. <HI>They have cho&s;en their own ways, and their &s;oul delighteth in their abominations.</HI></P>
<P>To illu&s;trate and confirm this, let me refer you to the &s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> which pre|&s;ents us with a notable draught &amp; &s;cheme of providence. God had a purpo&s;e to ad|vance <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and al&s;o a de&s;ign to &s;ave his fathers hou&s;e alive in a time of famine, by &s;ending him there before them to make provi&s;ion for them; and as a <HI>means</HI> to this <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;old to the <HI>I&s;hma|lites,</HI> and by them to an officer in <HI>Pharaohs</HI> court. But will any one &s;ay that his brethren did not act freely in their &s;elling of him, and gratifie their own envy and malice by that wicked deed?</P>
<P>So our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was <HI>the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world,</HI> in the divine coun&s;el and purpo&s;es; yet 'tis &s;aid of the <HI>Jews</HI> that <HI>for envy they delivered him to</HI> Pilate, Mat. 7.18. And the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> thus charges them, Acts 2.23. <HI>Him, being delivered by the determinate coun&s;el and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and &s;lain.</HI> The crime is expre&s;ly &s;aid to be their own, tho' done in pur&s;uance of the divine determi|nation.</P>

This may &s;eem a plau&s;ible objection at the fir&s;t &s;ound, but upon due con&s;ide|ration will not be found to overthrow what we a&s;&s;ert.

They can't po&s;&s;ibly mean that he wills the repentance and &s;alvation of all as he does of &s;ome; that he wills it as a thing which he will engage his power to accompli&s;h; for then it would immedi|ately come to pa&s;s. &mdash; The <HI>expo&s;tulations</HI> we meet with in &s;cripture, are forms of &s;peech well &s;uted to awaken men's con&s;ideration, bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, and excite them to return to God; and are of this u&s;e in the hand of the Spirit, in the effectual calling and conver&s;ion of God's elect. &mdash; The <HI>lamentations</HI> that are made over &s;inners, repre&s;ent the deplorablene&s;s of their condition, and that God has no plea&s;ure in their mi&s;ery con&s;ider'd as his creatures.

<P>And how can this doctrine have a peculi|ar tendency to drive per&s;ons to <HI>de&s;pair,</HI> when it a&s;certains &s;alvation to a <HI>very great number,</HI> an <HI>innumerable multitude;</HI> and no one knows but <HI>he</HI> is of that number? For it is a very great &s;in for any one to conclude him&s;elf a reprobate. The <HI>greate&s;t</HI> and the <HI>olde&s;t</HI> &s;inner may not do &s;o. For many of the elect of God have been left unto great &s;ins, and &s;uffer'd to lie long in &s;in too; but been after all bro't <HI>to the faith of God's elect,</HI> been <HI>wa&s;hed, &s;anctified</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="004497_0106_100D59B643570AA0">and <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> in this world, and <HI>glorified</HI> in the next. And if the &s;inner <HI>is</HI> awakned, and bro't into di&s;tre&s;s and agony, there is <HI>the more hope</HI> that he will be found of this number, and that a purpo&s;e of mercy con|cerning him is <HI>beginning</HI> to be executed. How in the world does this doctrine tend to de&s;pair any more than tho&s;e places of &s;cripture that &s;peak of the difficulty of &s;al|vation, and tells us that few comparitively will be &s;aved? Such pa&s;&s;ages as that in our &s;aviours &s;ermon on the mount, Mat. 7.13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be which go in there|at: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis ea&s;y to load any truth with mi&s;|repre&s;entations and abu&s;es if men will &s;et them&s;elves to do &s;o: and &s;uch is the per|ver&s;ene&s;s of &s;ome, that they will give a wrong turn to a thing that is never &s;o well explain'd and guarded. When we &s;et forth the <HI>mercy</HI> of God, his readine&s;s to pardon, and willingne&s;s to receive &s;inners that re|turn to him by repentance and faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;ome will abu&s;e it to <HI>pre&s;ump|tion,</HI> and from thence encourage them&s;elves to go on in &s;in becau&s;e grace abounds, and to defer their repentance to the la&s;t of their
<PB N="102" REF="004497_0107_100D59B7F2146F40">time. This, &s;o far as we can make a judg|ment, is a more <HI>common</HI> ca&s;e than the o|ther; and 'tis full as <HI>dangerous</HI> to the &s;ouls of men: Yet none would have us forbear it; and &s;ome think it can't be too often treated of, nor eno' enlarg'd upon.</P>
<P>Indeed it is a u&s;ual thing for per&s;ons under their fir&s;t awakenings, to have their minds exercis'd about the doctrine of elec|tion; but &s;o far as I have been able to ob|&s;erve, it has been a <HI>help,</HI> rather than an hindrance, to them in the work of a tho|rough conver&s;ion, and &s;aving clo&s;ure with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and has been us'd by the Holy Spirit as a means to excite them to give <HI>more diligence</HI> to make their calling &s;ure, and to lay <HI>the &s;tronger hold</HI> on the hope &s;et before them, in a glorious Chri&s;t to whom the go&s;pel invites them to flee for refuge.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems to me that upon a fair and ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, it will appear to every con&s;iderate and un|prejudic'd per&s;on, that a mini&s;ter in treat|ing with troubled awakned con&s;iences, can do it with much greater advantage upon the foot of <HI>particular election,</HI> and tho&s;e o|ther doctrines of grace that are connected with it, than on the foot of <HI>univer&s;al re|demption,</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="004497_0108_100D59BA2D535520">and the opinions that follow that. For, &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on in deep concern a|bout his everla&s;ting &s;alvation, &s;hou'd come to a mini&s;ter for his help and direction, and the mini&s;ter &s;hould tell him; God was a kind and merciful being, who delighted in the happine&s;s of his creatures, and made none of them mi&s;erable that did not make them&s;elves &s;o; and Chri&s;t was the &s;aviour of the world, who died for all men, and con&s;equently for him as much as for any one; and if he did but repent of his &s;ins, and tru&s;t in the merits of Chri&s;t, and lead a good life, and continue to do &s;o to the end, he need nor fear, for the go&s;pel pro|mis'd &s;alvation to him. Might he not re|ply? And if his concern was deep and tho|rough, he would reply to this effect; Tho' God <HI>is a kind and merciful being,</HI> 'tis as true that he is &s;o holy as to hate &s;in, and &s;o ju&s;t as to puni&s;h the &s;inner; and how much &s;o|ever he <HI>delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures,</HI> we know it will be the portion of a great many of them to be everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable: True, <HI>he makes none of them mi&s;erable that don't make them&s;elves &s;o;</HI> but this is my un|happy ca&s;e: I &s;ee I am a &s;inner, tho' I was not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it as I am now; I have revolted from him and rebelled again&s;t him; and I fear he will make me as mi&s;erable, as I have made my &s;elf &s;inful.

I find my heart to be hard and unbelieving, aver&s;e to the way of holine&s;s, and only bent to &s;in. And there are &s;o many evil inclinations to be denied, temptations to be re&s;i&s;ted, and ene|mies to be overcome, that <HI>I</HI> fear <HI>I</HI> &s;hall not hold out in the way to heaven; and with|out <HI>I</HI> endure to the end, <HI>I</HI> can't expect to be &s;aved.

On the other hand; When a mini&s;ter tells an inquiring, &s;olicitous, anxious &s;oul, not only that the death of Chri&s;t is of value &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e &s;alvation for all men, if God had been pleas'd to de&s;ign the &s;al|vation of all; but that he died to render the &s;alvation of a very great number of them infallibly certain; and therefore has purchas'd for every one of the&s;e that faith &amp; repentance which the go&s;pel makes nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;alvation, which are mo&s;t commonly wro't in them by the HolySpirit in the u&s;e of the appointed means; and that their final per&s;everance in grace, and compleat victory over &s;in, the world, and &s;atan, are &s;ecured in a well order'd covenant, of which the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the head and &s;urety: and if when the in|quiring per&s;on expre&s;les a doubt &amp; fear that he is not one of the happy number, &amp; &s;eems ready to be di&s;courag'd on this account, the mini&s;ter further lets him know, there is no real ground for any &s;uch fear, ina&s;|much as none can tell who are included in this number, and who are not; and many are included in it who have greatly fear'd the contrary; that the pre&s;ent concern of mind he is under renders it very hopeful that he will be found of this number at la&s;t, ina&s;much as this is the way of the Spirit with the elect of God, when he is about

<P>_WE have had three di&s;cour&s;es from the&s;e words concern|ing the doctrine of <HI>prede&s;ti|nation unto life.</HI> The truth has been explain'd &amp; &s;tated in &s;everal propo&s;itions. It has been confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by plain &s;cripture proof, and &s;olid argument agreeable to &s;cripture. Some mi&s;repre&s;entations made of it have been rectified; and &s;everal objections obvi|ated.
<PB N="110" REF="004497_0115_100D59CA68F8CCD0"><HI>I</HI> hope now to fini&s;h the &s;ubject as God &s;hall vouch&s;afe to help. And the next thing we are to proceed to according to the method we at fir&s;t propos'd is,</P>
<P N="4">IV. To &s;et before you &s;ome of the <HI>ab|&s;urd con&s;equences</HI> which follow upon the denial of this doctrine, and the <HI>difficulties</HI> of which the contrary &s;cheme labours, and with which they are embarra&s;s d who are on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. This, <HI>I</HI> apprehend, will ca&s;t &s;ome more light into the &s;ubject, and further confirm the truth we are maintaining; and it may help to undeceive &s;ome who have been ready to think all the difficulty lies on our part, and there is little or nothing for our opponents to reconcile, or to clear away, before this notion can be embrac'd.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="1">1. If &s;uch an election as we have been &s;peaking of is not granted, it follows, That <HI>the will of God,</HI> even in an affair wherein his own glory is &s;o greatly concern'd as the &s;alvation of men, is <HI>dependent on the will of the creature.</HI></P>
<P>I think the more general &s;cheme of tho&s;e who cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to the doctrine of election is, That God has not infallibly will'd the &s;alvation of any particular per|&s;ons,
<PB N="111" REF="004497_0116_100D30F3CD4B61A0">but conditionally will'd the &s;alvation of all men; that is, provided they will re|pent, and believe: but has not determin'd to give this repentance and faith to any in particular; at lea&s;t not till he &s;ees how they improve the common grace and ad|vantages they are under. This is evidently to make the will of God in this matter, &s;ubject to, and directed by the will of man, which is very di&s;honourable to him. This notion repre&s;ents God, as &s;aying, "I will that all men &s;hould be &s;aved; neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t finally be, not as <HI>I</HI> will, but as they will." This is in effect to take away the will of God; for, to be &s;ure he can have no ab&s;olute will of his own, who&s;e will mu&s;t be directed by the will of another, and is liable to be fru&s;trated by it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Without &s;uch an election as we are maintaining, God <HI>might</HI> be wholly di&s;|appointed in his &s;aving de&s;ign re&s;pecting the children of men, and the precious blood of Chri&s;t <HI>might</HI> have been &s;hed in vain. The o ne could not be &s;ecur'd, nor the other prevented, without an election of individuals, to whom the redemption pur|chas'd by Chri&s;t &s;hou'd be infallibly applied.</P>
<P>They will not get clear of this ab&s;urd con&s;equence, by having recour&s;e to the
<PB N="112" REF="004497_0117_100D59D031F619A0">fore-knowledge of God, and &s;aying, he cer|tainly fore-knew that &s;ome, and a great number wou'd repent and believe, and &s;o was a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;hou'd not be di&s;appointed in his de&s;ign, and that his &s;on would not die in vain; becau&s;e, as we have &s;hown already, the fore-knowledge of God ne|ce&s;&s;arily infers his fore-ordination: for it is certain, that when all things <HI>future</HI> were no where but in the mind of God, in the days of eternity, he cou'd know nothing of them but what was his determinate will and coun&s;el concerning them.</P>
<P>Or if they will &s;ay, that to prevent this di&s;appointment, God will &s;o order it that &s;ome &s;hall be inclin'd and di&s;pos'd to com|ply with the terms of &s;alvation; this is in effect to give up the point, and grant what we a&s;&s;ert: for this will be to allow <HI>di&s;crimi|nating grace exercis'd in time,</HI> which can't well be defended without allowing a <HI>di&s;|crimination in God's purpo&s;e</HI> relating thereto; becau&s;e they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e there are new determinations in the divine will, which wou'd be to argue him imperfect in wi&s;dom and knowledge.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another of the gro&s;s ab&s;urdities which I apprehend follows upon the denial of this doctrine is, That man's &s;alvation is
<PB N="113" REF="004497_0118_100D59D1B760B648">left at the &s;ame uncertainty under the <HI>new covenant,</HI> that it was in under the <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> nay, that the &s;tate of mankind <HI>now,</HI> is much more difficult and dangerous than it was then.</P>
<P>Man's happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, turned upon the exerci&s;e of his own free will under the fir&s;t covenant; and &s;o it does &s;till if the &s;al|vation of a number is not &s;ecur'd by elec|ting love and grace. And can we &s;uppo&s;e it con&s;i&s;tent with the love and kindne&s;s of God, to leave &s;alvation again to depend upon the will of man, which had ruin'd him once before? If free-will ruin'd man in his <HI>fir&s;t &s;tate,</HI> while he was <HI>upright;</HI> is it not much more likely to ruin him in his <HI>wor&s;t &s;tate,</HI> now that he is <HI>fallen</HI> and <HI>corrupt?</HI> How can we imagine the wi&s;e God to ex|pect his de&s;ign of man's &s;alvation &s;hou'd be an&s;wer'd in the &s;ame way, when it was ren|dered much more unlikely; I may &s;ay impo&s;|&s;ible now, tho' it was not &s;o before? Agre|ably we read, Job 15.15. <HI>Behold, he putteth no tru&s;t in his &s;aints.</HI> He does not tru&s;t the concerns of his glory in their &s;alvation, in their own hands; for he well knew his &s;aving de&s;ign wou'd then never take effect. And therefore their &s;alvation is infallibly &s;ecur'd by the new covenant, which is call'd a <HI>better covenant, e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon better
<PB N="114" REF="004497_0119_100D59D34745E0A0">promi&s;es;</HI> promi&s;es of reconciling, renewing and per&s;evering grace, po&s;itive and ab&s;o|lute, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.6. A tran&s;cript of which co|venant follows, in the 10, 11, &amp; 12. v. and it runs in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute unconditi|onal &s;train that can be; <HI>This is the covenant that I will make with them, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people. And they &s;hall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, Know the Lord: for all &s;hall know me, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t. For I will be merciful to their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and their &s;ins and their iniqui|ties will I remember no more.</HI></P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Another of the con&s;equences, which, as I conceive, follows upon the denial of this doctrine is, That the &s;alvati|on of every <HI>particular man</HI> does <HI>originate</HI> with him&s;elf; or at lea&s;t is to be <HI>divided</HI> between God and the creature.</P>
<P>They that are in the other way of think|ing, &s;uppo&s;e that by the death of Chri&s;t mankind are put into a &s;alvable &s;tate; but that the &s;ucce&s;s <HI>as to particular per&s;ons</HI> de|pends upon their acceptance of the offer'd &s;alvation, and compliance with the terms of it; which acceptance and compliance
<PB N="116" REF="004497_0120_100D59D56EA77758">(according to them) are not the re&s;ult and fruit of God's purpo&s;e of grace, but rather of mens own rea&s;on and con|&s;ideration, will and choice excited by tho&s;e rational arguments that have been &s;et before them, and that moral &s;ua&s;ion which has been u&s;ed with them. Some of the&s;e will indeed &s;peak of the <HI>grace of God,</HI> and acknowledge we can do nothing without <HI>that;</HI> but all they &s;eem to mean is a <HI>common general grace</HI> which goes along with the go&s;pel, and one may improve to equal advantage as another. &mdash; And if it be thus, the &s;inner that is &s;av'd, is furni&s;h'd with an ea&s;y an&s;wer to that que&s;tion, 1 Cor. 4.7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ from another?</HI> The happy difference in&s;tead of being a&s;crib'd to the free and powerful grace of God, mu&s;t upon this principle, be a&s;crib'd to the man him&s;elf, his own rea&s;on and choice, good conduct and endeavours. There is no <HI>medium</HI> here; for according to the apo&s;tles arguing, every mans &s;alvation takes ri&s;e from the free grace of God in election, or from his own works. Rom. 11.5, 6. <HI>Even &s;o at this time al&s;o there is a remnant according to the election of grace. And if by grace,</HI> (&s;uch as I mention'd ju&s;t now, vi z. electing grace; <HI>if by grace,</HI> I &s;ay) <HI>then it is no more of works; otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is
<PB N="116" REF="004497_0121_100D59D7902FB128">no more grace; otherwi&s;e work is no more work.</HI> But that doctrine which gives the creature &s;o much room to boa&s;t, and put in for &s;o great a &s;hare in the honour of his own &s;al|vation, cannot be of God; for he will not have any thing of his <HI>glory given to another.</HI> And nothing can be more contrary to the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, which is to &s;tain the pride of all fle&s;h, to take away all occa|&s;ions of glorying from the creature, and to &s;ecure to divine grace its full honours. The prophet &s;hews the glory and tendency of the go&s;pel &s;tate, when he &s;ays, as in I&s;a. 2.17. <HI>The loftine&s;s of man &s;hall be bowed down, and the haughtine&s;s of men &s;hall be made low, and the Lord alone &s;hall be exalted in that day.</HI></P>
<P>The exaltation of FREE GRACE is evi|dently what the glorious God aims at in the contrivance of fallen man's redemption. To this the whole frame is admirably fitted, from the fir&s;t corner &s;tone, to the bringing forth the top &s;tone thereof. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31. <HI>That no fle&s;h &s;hou'd glory in his pre|&s;ence. But of him are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</HI> Eph. 2.7, 8, 9. <HI>That in the ages to come he might &s;hew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us,
<PB N="117" REF="004497_0122_100D59D9AD2D52A8">through Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For by grace are ye &s;aved, through faith; and that not of your &s;elves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lea&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI></P>

But here I mu&s;t be content with hinting at things, without enlargment, or I &s;hall much exceed my limits.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure; The <HI>go&s;pel</HI> can't be fully preach'd if this article is dropt; for it is evidently a great part of the &s;ubject matter of the &s;acred pages.</P>
<P>We can't rightly conceive of the <HI>attri|butes</HI> of God, if we are unacquainted with this doctrine. &mdash; It is in this decree of election, that &s;everal of the glories and ex|cellencies of the divine nature, appear in their brighte&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light. As to the <HI>Jovereignty</HI> of the great God, his ab&s;o|lute &s;upremacy over all creatures, and right to di&s;po&s;e of them for his own glory; <HI>this</HI> is left out of the notion men frame of God, and he quite loo&s;es the glory of this
<PB N="118" REF="004497_0123_100D59DB6F144EA0">high prerogative, when this truth is not under&s;tood and acknowledg'd &mdash;. And as to the divine <HI>goodne&s;s, mercy</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> no|thing di&s;plays the&s;e &s;o much, as the ever|la&s;ting purpo&s;e of God to deliver &s;o many of the children of <HI>Adam,</HI> from the mi&s;ery they had involv'd them&s;elves in, and the puni&s;hment they had de&s;erv'd. To deliver &s;ome, and not all, renders the divine good|ne&s;s towards the &s;ubjects of this deliver|ance, more per&s;picuous and glorious. The &s;alvation of men wou'd not &s;o fully appear to be from <HI>free mercy</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> if no differ|ence was made between per&s;ons. To this purpo&s;e the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, Rom. 11.23. <HI>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, whom he had afore prepared unto glory.</HI> His making choice of <HI>&s;ome,</HI> while he pa&s;&s;es by others, commends his favour to <HI>them,</HI> renders it more glori|ous in their eyes, con&s;trains their admira|tion now, and will rai&s;e their highe&s;t notes of prai&s;e hereafter. The eternal melody they will make, is that, Rev. 5.9. <HI>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the &s;eals thereof: for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeem'd us to God by thy blood</HI> OUT OF <HI>every tongue, and kindred, and nation.</HI></P>

What will become of that <HI>covenant of redemption</HI> between the father and the &s;on from the days of eternity, of which we read in the 89th <HI>P&s;alm;</HI> 53d ch. of <HI>I&s;aiah;</HI> 10th and 17th ch. of <HI>John,</HI> and other places; if a di&s;tingui&s;h'd number were not given to Chri&s;t, as his charge, and as his reward? &mdash; The <HI>&s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t</HI> is rendred a very loo&s;e uncertain and un&s;afe thing, if there are not a certain number for whom it was made and accept|ed; and the value of it is le&s;&s;en'd exceed|ingly, if it did not purcha&s;e faith, repent|ance, and holine&s;s, for them on whom they are be&s;towed. &mdash; That <HI>free will</HI> which &s;tands in competition with, and oppo&s;ition to the grace of God in our &s;alvation, can never without this be thrown to the ground as it ought to be. &mdash; The doctrine of <HI>effica|tious grace</HI> which does &s;o much honour to the Holy Spirit; and the doctrine of the <HI>&s;aints per&s;everance in grace,</HI> which is &s;o com|fortable to them; depend very much on this doctrine of <HI>election.</HI>&mdash; This is the <HI>foundation</HI> of all tho&s;e <HI>great and precious promi&s;es</HI> con|tain'd in the new covenant; the <HI>ground|work</HI> of our redemption; the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;pring</HI> of all tho&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings we are made the partakers of, to which the &s;aints &s;hou'd look back in their joyful prai&s;es, and
<PB N="120" REF="004497_0125_100D59E14CD29BA8">without the con&s;ideration of which, they cannot <HI>comprehend what is the height and depth, the length and breadth of the love of God in Chri&s;t</HI> It is therefore taken into that thanksgiving of the apo&s;tle, Eph. 1.3.4. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly things,</HI> ACCORDING AS HE HAS CHOSEN US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUN|DATION OF THE WORLD.</P>
<P>In a word; As this doctrine is a &s;pring of <HI>con&s;olation</HI> to believers, &s;o 'tis a mo&s;t powerful argument to holine&s;s &amp; <HI>obedience;</HI> and this not only that they mayn't be without the tokens of election, but out of gratitude, and by way of acknowledgment to God for his di&s;tingui&s;hing and eternal love to them. Accordingly it is matter of ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e who have embrac'd this doctrine, have been among the mo&s;t exemplary, cautious, diligent and fruitful chri&s;tians. But this has almo&s;t enter'd me into the</P>
<P>VIth and la&s;t thing propo&s;'d, namely, The <HI>improvement of the &s;ubject</HI> to the ends of &s;erious religion, and practical godline&s;s. For had I taken it to be only an ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculation, and not <HI>a doctrine according to godline&s;s,</HI> I had &s;par'd my &s;elf the pains of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="004497_0126_100D59E2D2C60F90">
The &s;ubject may be improv'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. To let us into the meaning of &s;everal of the acts of God's <HI>providence.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we are from hence furni&s;h'd with a rea&s;on, why <HI>the human race was not ca&s;t off by God, upon the apo&s;tacy,</HI> as were the angels that &s;inned. It was becau&s;e there was an election of grace among&s;t them. This gave birth to the early promi&s;e of the &s;eed of the woman to break the &s;erpents head. To this it was owing that there was an arre&s;t of judgment, after the &s;entence was pro|nounc'd on our apo&s;tate parents; and that mankind was allow'd to partake &s;o largely of the divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>We al&s;o learn from hence the rea&s;on of God's patience with the <HI>pre&s;ent world,</HI> that is grown &s;o &s;inful. It is becau&s;e of a di&s;tingui&s;h'd remnant of mankind that are in it now, and are to be born into it here|after. So tho&s;e words are to be expounded, I&s;a. 65.8, 9. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, as the new wine is found in the clu&s;ter, and one &s;aith, de&s;troy it not, for a ble&s;&s;ing is in it: &s;o will I do for my &s;ervants &s;ake, that I may not de&s;troy them all. And I will bring forth a &s;eed out of</HI> Jacob, <HI>and out of</HI> Judah <HI>an inheritor of my mountains: and mine cloot &s;hall inherit it, and my &s;ervants &s;hall
<PB N="122" REF="004497_0127_100D59E500CA3988">dwell there.</HI> So our &s;aviour &s;aid that <HI>for the elects &s;ake,</HI> the days of the de&s;truction of the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;hortned, and a &s;top put to that de&s;olation, which otherwi&s;e wou'd have proceeded to that degree, that no fle&s;h &s;hould be &s;aved, <HI>Mat</HI> 24.22. When the elect of God are all born into the world, and ripened for heaven, then judgment will commence, the patience of God with our &s;inful &s;pecies will be at an end, and that de&s;truction by fire unto which the world is re&s;erv'd will come on.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>Here's a rea&s;on of the divine forbearance and long &s;uffering towards <HI>particular &s;inners.</HI> If they are not among the elect them&s;elves, who are to be effectually called in due time, it may be &s;ome of the elect are to <HI>&s;pring from them,</HI> and for this rea&s;on they are &s;par'd notwith&s;tanding all their provocations. If God &s;hould make quick work, and <HI>early de&s;troy</HI> all the wicked of the earth, whence &s;hou'd his elect ari&s;e in the world? <HI>Jero|boam</HI> and <HI>Abrz</HI> were not cut off in their fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e good <HI>Abijah</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah</HI> were to &s;pring from them. Many that will heartily embrace Chri&s;t, mu&s;t ri&s;e from &s;uch as reject him. The Lord &s;uffers many a wicked per&s;on to &s;tand for a time under his patience, &s;ays holy Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> becau&s;e children are to &s;pring from them,
<PB N="123" REF="004497_0128_100D59E71BD7EA18">who will obey and embrace that Chri&s;t whom their wicked parents rejected." The world then has no need to murmur at, and quarrel with this doctrine of election as they do. It is well for the re&s;t of the world that there is an election of grace out of it. Others fare the better for this: Since for the &s;ake of the&s;e the wicked world is &s;par'd from age to age, and the execution of di|vine ju&s;tice towards particular &s;inners de|layed.</P>
<P N="2">2. This doctrine affords much <HI>comfort</HI> and <HI>encouragement</HI> to &s;erious and thoughtful minds, in times of great <HI>defection</HI> and <HI>cor|ruption.</HI></P>
<P>When there is a wide &s;pread of error, and a mighty torrent of profanene&s;s; when evil men and &s;educers wax wor&s;e &amp; wor&s;e, as they will do in the la&s;t days; when many are turned from the faith, and num|bers loo&s;e their fir&s;t love; let the pious and faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us remember for their encouragement, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|ceive the elect, in things that are e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation; and <HI>the foundation of God &s;tands &s;ure; having this &s;eal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</HI> And it may be the number of the&s;e is much larger than we are &s;ome|times ready to &s;ear.

<PB N="124" REF="004497_0129_100D59E8A03F8610">and &s;ervice of God was &s;o general, that the good prophet tho't there was no one be&s;ide him&s;elf who pre&s;erv'd his integrity, he was told for h s comfort, there were thou&s;ands more. The apo&s;tle mentions this in&s;tance, and applies it to the times of the preach|ing of the go&s;pel, Rom. 11.2, 3, 4, 5. <HI>God hath not ca&s;t away his people which he fore|knew. Wot ye not what the &s;cripture &s;aith of</HI> Elias? <HI>how he maketh interce&s;&s;ion to God again&s;t</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>&s;aying, Lord, they have killed thy pro|phets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they &s;eek my life.

<P N="3">3. Since &s;ome of the children of men are cho&s;en unto &s;alvation, prede&s;tinated unto life, let us inquire, Whether we have, at pre&s;ent, any good ground to hope that we are of the di&s;tingui&s;h'd number.</P>
<P>This may be known, or the apo&s;tle would not have exhorted us to <HI>give dili|gence to make our election &s;ure;</HI> as he does in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. And he writes to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> as if their election, (or the election of the <HI>body</HI> of that church) was
<PB N="125" REF="004497_0130_100D59EC25DECF18">no longer a matter of doubt, but of cer|tainty. The 1&s;t ep. 1 ch. 4. v. <HI>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</HI></P>

<P>The apo&s;tle in the place ju&s;t mentioned, tells the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> what was the proof of their election. <HI>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God: For our go&s;pel came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance.</HI> Inquire then, what effect the word of the go&s;pel has had upon you Has it come to you <HI>with power?</HI> Has it had a convincing, enlightning, hum|bling, converting efficacy upon you?

<P>The apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o &s;hews us in what way and order to make our election &s;ure.

<P>We are told, Acts 13.48. <HI>As many as were ordained unto eternal life, believed.</HI> Ex|amine then, whether <HI>the faith of God's elect</HI> is wro't in you.

<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>Your <HI>love to God,</HI> as well as your faith in Chri&s;t, evidences your election: for &s;o we read, 1 John 4.19. <HI>We love him, becau&s;e be fir&s;t loved us.</HI> Let it then be inquir'd, Do I <HI>love the Lord our God with all the heart, and &s;oul, and mind, and &s;trongth?</HI> Do I make choice of him before all other things, and delight in him &s;upreamly?

He has proclaim'd his name, <HI>The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, long &s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth.</HI> He has actually pardon'd thou&s;ands and millions in the like condition; and his reconciling work is not yet at an end. A gracious mediator is provided to intro|duce you into his pre&s;ence, and to make interce&s;&s;ion for you: If you will not then apply and &s;eek, &s;urely you de&s;erve to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>O man, woman, whoever thou art, I mu&s;t tell you before I leave you, Your election of God need not lie long at &s;uch uncer|tainty with you. Yea, I may venture to
<PB N="132" REF="004497_0137_100D59FB5A7A7140">tell you, it may po&s;&s;ibly be bro't to a happy conclu&s;ion at this very time, that you are of this number I mu&s;t repeat tho&s;e words of our &s;aviour, John 6.37. <HI>All that the fa|ther giveth me, &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Com|ing to Chri&s;t then is the fruit and evidence of election; and &s;o this important matter may be decided by it. Now the call of Chri&s;t to you in the go&s;pel this day is; <HI>In|cline your ear, and come unto me; bear and your &s;oul &s;hall live: and I will make an everla&s;ting covenant with you, even the &s;ure mercies of</HI> David. Come to me, O &s;inner, for &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as I have to be&s;tow on the people of God. Put your &s;oul over into my hands, to be wa&s;h'd in my blood, ju&s;t fied by my righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctified by my &s;pirit, and pre&s;erv'd by my power. Let me henceforth be your prophet to teach and enlighten you, your prie&s;t to atone and interceed for you, and your king to rule you for my &s;elf &mdash;. If any &s;oul of you do now comply with this call: If you can make this an&s;wer, <HI>Lord, I am willing to come to thee, for the&s;e ends and pur|po&s;es. Thou ha&s;t made me willing. I con&s;ent to be thine</HI> now <HI>if I never did before, and take thee for my &s;aviour leader, owner, and ruler for ever</HI> &mdash; The matter is then at this time bro't to an i&s;&s;ue. The &s;ecret decree of
<PB N="133" REF="004497_0138_100D59FE1B0BD7E8">election <HI>this day opens</HI> upon you. You may now know you were fir&s;t given to Chri&s;t by the father, or you wou'd never have been inclined and enabled thus to come to him; and henceforth you may read your <HI>name written in the lamb's book of life.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t u&s;e may be to put tho&s;e who have any good <HI>ground to hope that they are of this number,</HI> upon &s;ome &s;pecial duties agreeable to their &s;tate and privileges.</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;hou'd thankfully <HI>acknowledge and adore the riches of di&s;tingui&s;hing grace,</HI> eminently illu&s;trated in your election. The di&s;ciple was &s;o affected with the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing favour of heaven, to him&s;elf and others, as in a rapture to cry out, John 14.22. <HI>Lord, bow is it, that thou wilt manife&s;t thy &s;elf to us, and not unto the world!</HI> A be|liever may &s;ay, How is it Lord, that thou &s;hou'd chu&s;e <HI>me!</HI> That thou &s;hou'd &s;et thine everla&s;ting love upon <HI>me,</HI> when &s;o many others, fallen men as well as fallen angels, are pa&s;s'd by! And &s;o many of the learned, rich, and honourable of the world! And this before I had any thing good in me; upon no fore-&s;een merit; nay, not|with&s;tanding thou &s;awe&s;t how I &s;hou'd di&s;|honour and provoke thee by my &s;ins! O glorious, &s;overeign, &amp; di&s;tingui&s;hing grace!
<PB N="134" REF="004497_0139_100D59FFC6FD65F0">I can never eno' admire it! Eternity will not be too long to prai&s;e thee for it! &mdash; Peculiar favour calls for &s;pecial thankful|ne&s;s. <HI>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes: Even &s;o, father, for &s;o it &s;eemeth good in thy &s;ight!</HI> Here, here, &s;ays one, are <Q>thanksgivings of the mo&s;t elevated &s;train in chri&s;tianity They are words, to <HI>lift up the born.</HI> They &s;ound high in our devotions. A thankful Chri&s;tian rai|&s;es his thanksgivings to the highe&s;t notes, when he comes hereabouts. 'Tis a melody peculiarly acceptable to hea|ven; 'tis the very beginning of heaven.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Love him who has fir&s;t loved you,</HI> in &s;uch a manner as may &s;omething an&s;wer his love to you. He lov'd you <HI>before you bad a being;</HI> and you &s;hould love him <HI>while you have any being.</HI> He lov'd you <HI>above many others;</HI> &amp; you mu&s;t love him <HI>above all creatures,</HI> more than <HI>hou&s;es and lands, brother or &s;i&s;ter, father or mother, husband, wi&s;e, or children;</HI> or you are not worthy of him, or of that love which he has plac'd upon you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Always remember you are under <HI>the highe&s;t obligations to holine&s;s and obedience.</HI> For <HI>ye are a cho&s;en generation, a royal prie&s;thood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye &s;hou'd

<P N="4">4. Cheerfully <HI>acquie&s;ce in all the dealings of God with you.</HI> For all his providences are the effect of his purpo&s;es, and are be&s;t &s;uted to carry on his de&s;ign of grace con|cerning you. <HI>We know,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, in the ver&s;e before our text, <HI>That all things
<PB N="136" REF="004497_0141_100D5A054CEA6968">&s;hall work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpo&s;e.</HI> You are <HI>prede&s;tinated,</HI> &s;ays our text, <HI>to be conformed to the image of his &s;on;</HI> and your very afflictions and &s;orrows are appointed to bring you to this confor|mity to Chri&s;t, who was him&s;elf <HI>a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief.</HI> You may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that nothing you meet with can hinder the purpo&s;e of God concerning you from taking effect, but rather all things &s;hall be &s;ub&s;ervient the reunto. Therefore you may not only take the comfort of your mercies, but get above your afflictions, and <HI>rejoice in tribulation.</HI> Read the believers &s;ecurity and triumph, in the ver&s;es follow|ing our text; <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died, yea rather, that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right band of God, who al&s;o maketh in|terce&s;&s;ion for us. Who &s;hall &s;eparate us from the love of Chri&s;t? &s;hall tribulation, or di&s;tre&s;s, or per&s;ecution, or famine, or nakedne&s;s, or peril, or &s;word? (As it is written, For thy &s;ake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter) Nay in all the&s;e things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am per&s;waded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come,
<PB N="137" REF="004497_0142_100D5A06D0C993B0">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Forget not to <HI>pray for all that belong to the election of grace</HI> For tho&s;e that are not yet gather'd. <HI>Other &s;heep</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>has, which are</HI> not yet bro't into <HI>the fold;</HI> pray that the&s;e may <HI>hear his voice,</HI> and <HI>follow him.</HI> Some of the elect are not only <HI>uncalled,</HI> but <HI>unborn:</HI> It is therefore a &s;utable petition in the publick liturgy of the <HI>church of England,</HI> which we can join in, <HI>That it may plea&s;e God of his gracious goodne&s;s &s;hortly to accompli&s;h the number of his elect"</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> in the Common Prayer Book.</NOTE></P>
<P>And pray for them that are gather'd and added to the church, <HI>That they may be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation, as he who has called them is holy:</HI> May <HI>walk in the fear of the Lord, and in the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and be pre&s;&s;ing on towards perfection: May be guarded and &s;afely carried thro' this evil world, till they joyfully enter upon the rewards of the next.

6. Let the <HI>&s;econd coming and appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> be the matter of your earne&s;t <HI>prayer,</HI> and object of your joyful <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>expectation.</HI> For in this day the Lord will <HI>make up his jewels.</HI> Now Chri&s;t will rai&s;e up all that were given him by the father, without letting any be lo&s;t or want|ing; &s;aying to his father, <HI>Here I am, and the children which thou ha&s;t given me.</HI> I pre&s;ent them all together, <HI>a glorious church, not having &s;pot, or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing.</HI> This will be done <HI>with exceeding joy,</HI> both on the part of the Father who cho&s;e them, the Son who redeem'd them, the Holy Spirit who &s;anctified them, mini&s;ters who were in&s;trumental to gather them in, and on the part of the cho&s;en and redeemed them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>We have a plea&s;ant vi&s;ion of Chri&s;t at the head of a happy remnant, pre&s;erv'd from the corruptions and carried thro' the per&s;ecutions of <HI>antichri&s;t:</HI> Read it; and then think what a glorious &s;ight it will be to &s;ee him at the head of the whole church of the elect in the great day. Rev. 14.1, to 5. <HI>And I looked, and lo, a Lamb &s;tood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thou&s;and, having his Fathers name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as
<PB N="139" REF="004497_0144_100D5A0A5B12F820">the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they &s;ung as it were a new &s;ong before the throne, and before the four bea&s;ts, and the elders: and no man could learn that &s;ong, but the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which were redee|med from the earth. The&s;e are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins: the&s;e are they which follow the Lamb whither|&s;oever he goeth: the&s;e were redeemed from a|mong men, being the fir&s;t fruits unto God, and the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have been carried thro' what I propos'd on this &s;ubject. Many things which belong to it have been omitted; and others but touch'd, which I could with plea&s;ure have enlarg'd upon: but I have &s;tudied brevity.</P>
<P>And now, I de&s;ire to <HI>bow the knee in thanksgiving to the God and father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who has given me this oppor|tunity to bear a &s;mall te&s;timony to the&s;e important truths. I tru&s;t I have had a &s;ingle aim at his glory in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es; and &s;o I look to Him, in his &s;on JESUS, for his gracious acceptance of what has been his own, and his merciful forgivene&s;s of
<PB N="140" REF="004497_0145_100D5A0EB8BF5800">what has been otherwi&s;e; and on him I humbly depend to &s;ucceed them.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e all with the apo&s;tles prayer and benediction, in 2 The&s;s. 2.16, 17. <HI>Now our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>him&s;elf, and</HI> GOD <HI>even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everla&s;ting con&s;olation, and good hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and &s;tabli&s;h you in every good word and work.</HI></P>
