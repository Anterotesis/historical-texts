<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the in&s;titution, maintenance and ad|mini&s;tration of government, is to &s;ecure the exi&s;t|ence of the body-politic; to protect it; and to furni&s;h the individuals who compo&s;e it, with the power of enjoying, in &s;afety and tranquility, their natural rights, and the ble&s;&s;ings of life: And whenever the&s;e great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the govern|ment, and to take mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety, pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE body-politic is formed by a voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of individuals: It is a &s;ocial compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all &s;hall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, there|fore, in framing a Con&s;titution of Government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his &s;ecurity in them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016845_0004_0F9EBEC5B8BFB5C0">WE, therefore, the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, acknow|ledging, with grateful hearts, the goodne&s;s of the Great Legi&s;lator of the Univer&s;e, in affording us, in the cour&s;e of His Providence, an opportunity, deliberately and peace|ably, without fraud, violence or &s;urprize, of entering into an original, explicit, and &s;olemn compact with each other; and of forming a new Con&s;titution of Civil Government, for our&s;elves and po&s;terity; and devoutly imploring His direction in &s;o intere&s;ting a de&s;ign, DO agree upon, or|dain and e&s;tabli&s;h, the following <HI>Declaration of Rights, and Frame of Government,</HI> as the CONSTITUTION of the COMMONWEALTH of MASSACHUSETTS.</P>

<HEAD>PART THE FIRST. A DECLARATION of the RIGHTS of the Inhabitants of the Common|wealth of MASSACHUSETTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. I.</NOTE>ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural e&s;&s;ential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, and protecting property; in fine, that of &s;eeking and obtaining their &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is the right as well as the duty of all men in &s;o|ciety, publicly, and at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, to wor&s;hip the SU|PREME BEING, the great creator and pre&s;erver of the univer&s;e. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re|&s;trained, in his per&s;on, liberty, or e&s;tate, for wor&s;hiping GOD in the manner and &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to the dic|tates of his own con&s;cience; or for his religious profe&s;&s;ion or &s;entiments; provided he doth not di&s;turb the public peace, or ob&s;truct others in their religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happine&s;s of a people, and the good order and pre&s;ervation of civil government, e&s;&s;entially depend upon piety, religion and morality; and as the&s;e cannot be generally diffu&s;ed through a community, but by the in&s;ti|tution of the public wor&s;hip of GOD, and of public in|&s;tructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happine&s;s, and to &s;ecure the good order and pre&s;ervation of their government, the people of this Com|monwealth have a right to inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with power to authorize and require, and the legi&s;lature &s;hall, from time to time, authorize and require, the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, precincts and other bodies politic, or reli|gious &s;ocieties, to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own ex|pence, for the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of GOD,
<PB N="8" REF="016845_0006_0F9EBEC78E1D1D08">
and for the &s;upport and maintenance of public prote&s;tant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all ca&s;es where &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>AND the people of this Commonwealth have al&s;o a right to, and do, inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with authority to enjoin upon all the &s;ubjects an attendance upon the in&s;truc|tions of the public teachers afore&s;aid, at &s;tated times and &s;ea&s;ons, if there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions they can con|&s;cienciou&s;ly and conveniently attend.</P>
<P>PROVIDED notwith&s;tanding, that the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious &s;ocieties, &s;hall, at all times, have the exclu&s;ive right of elec|ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their &s;upport and maintenance</P>
<P>AND all monies paid by the &s;ubject to the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip, and of the public teachers afore&s;aid, &s;hall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the &s;upport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious &s;ect or de|nomination, provided there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions he attends; otherwi&s;e it may be paid towards the &s;up|port of the teacher or teachers of the pari&s;h or precinct in which the &s;aid monies are rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>AND every denomination of chri&s;tians, demeaning them&s;elves peaceably, and as good &s;ubjects of the Com|monwealth, &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law: And no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomina|tion to another &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE people of this Commonwealth have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of governing them&s;elves as a free, &s;o|vereign, and independent &s;tate; and do, and forever here|after &s;hall, exerci&s;e and enjoy every power, juri&s;diction, and right which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expre&s;ly delegated to the United States of America in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P N="5">V. ALL power re&s;iding originally in the people, and being derived from them, the &s;everal magi&s;trates and offi|cers
<PB N="9" REF="016845_0007_0F9EBEC7FB14B9B0">
of government, ve&s;ted with authority, whether legi&s;|lative, executive, or judicial, are their &s;ub&s;titutes and a|gents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. NO man, nor corporation, or a&s;&s;ociation of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclu&s;ive privileges, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the com|munity, than what ari&s;es from the con&s;ideration of &s;ervices rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei|ther hereditary, nor tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible to children, or de&s;cendents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a magi&s;trate, lawgiver, or judge, is ab&s;urd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. GOVERNMENT is in&s;tituted for the common good; for the protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private intere&s;t of any one man, family or cla&s;s of men: Therefore the people alone have an inconte&s;tible, unalienable, and inde|fea&s;ible tight to in&s;titute government; and to reform, alter, or totally charge the &s;ame, when their protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. IN order to prevent tho&s;e, who are ve&s;ted with authority, from becoming oppre&s;&s;ors, the people have a right, at &s;uch periods and in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall e&s;ta|bli&s;h by their frame of government, to cau&s;e the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant pla|ces by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. ALL elections ought to be free and all the inhabi|tants of this Commonwealth, having &s;uch qualifications as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X EACH individual of the &s;ociety has a right to be pro|tected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and proper|ty, according to &s;tanding laws. He is obliged, con&s;equent|ly, to contribute his &s;hare to the expence of this protecti|on; to give his per&s;onal &s;ervice, or an equivalent, when nece&s;&s;ary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with ju&s;tice, be taken from him, or applied to public
<PB N="10" REF="016845_0008_0F9EBEC9758176C8">
u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of the repre&s;entative body of the people: In fine, the people of this Common|wealth are not controulable by any other laws, than tho&s;e to which their con&s;titutional repre&s;entative body have given their con&s;ent. And whenever the public exigencies require, that the property of any individual &s;hould be appropriated to public u&s;es, he &s;hall receive a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation therefor.</P>
<P N="11">XI. EVERY &s;ubject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recour&s;e to the laws for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his per&s;on, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and ju&s;|tice freely, and without being obliged to purcha&s;e it; com|pleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. NO &s;ubject &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for any crime or offence, until the &s;ame is fully and plainly, &s;ub&s;tantially and formally, de&s;cribed to him; or be compelled to accu&s;e, or furni&s;h evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. And every &s;ubject &s;hall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa|vourable to him; to meet the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by him&s;elf, or his council, at his election. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be arre&s;t|ed, impri&s;oned, de&s;poiled, or deprived of his property, im|munities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or e&s;tate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>AND the legi&s;lature &s;hall not make any law, that &s;hall &s;ubject any per&s;on to a capital or infamous puni&s;hment, ex|cepting for the government of the army and navy, without trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. IN criminal pro&s;ecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greate&s;t &s;ecurities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. EVERY &s;ubject has a right to be &s;ecure from all unrea&s;onable &s;earches, and &s;eizures, of his per&s;on, his hou|&s;es, his papers, and all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. All warrants, there|fore,
<PB N="11" REF="016845_0009_0F9EBECCADDE85F0">
are contrary to this right, if the cau&s;e or foundation of them be not previou&s;ly &s;upported by oath or affirmati|on; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make &s;earch in &s;u&s;pected places, or to arre&s;t one or more &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or to &s;eize their property, be not accom|panied with a &s;pecial de&s;ignation of the per&s;ons or objects of &s;earch, arre&s;t, or &s;eizure: and no warrant ought to be i&s;|&s;ued but in ca&s;es, and with the formalities, pre&s;cribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. IN all controver&s;ies concerning property, and in all &s;uits between two or more per&s;ons, except in ca&s;es in which it has heretofore been otherways u&s;ed and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this me|thod of procedure &s;hall be held &s;acred, unle&s;s, in cau&s;es ari|&s;ing on the high-&s;eas, and &s;uch as relate to mariners wagers, the legi&s;lature &s;hall hereafter find it nece&s;&s;ary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THE liberty of the pre&s;s is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of freedom in a &s;tate: it ought not, therefore, to be re|&s;trained in this Commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. THE people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be main|tained without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature; and the mi|litary power &s;hall always be held in an exact &s;ubordination to the civil authority and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A FREQUENT recurrence to the fundamental principles of the con&s;titution, and a con&s;tant adherence to tho&s;e of piety, ju&s;tice, moderation, temperance, indu&s;try, and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the ad|vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government: The people ought, con&s;equently, to have a particular at|tention to all tho&s;e principles, in the choice of their officers and repre&s;entatives: And they have a right to require of their law-givers and magi&s;trates, an exact and con&s;tant ob|&s;ervance of them, in the formation and execution of the laws nece&s;&s;ary for the good admini&s;tration of the Common|wealth.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="12" REF="016845_0010_0F9EBECD86F2EE40">XIX. THE people have a right, in an orderly and peace|able manner, to a&s;&s;emble to con&s;ult upon the common good: give in&s;tructions to their repre&s;entatives; and to reque&s;t of the legi&s;lative body, by the way of addre&s;&s;es, petitions, or remon&s;trances, redre&s;s of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they &s;uffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. THE power of &s;u&s;pending the laws, or the execu|tion of the laws, ought never to be exerci&s;ed but by the le|gi&s;lature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerci&s;ed in &s;uch particular ca&s;es only as the legi&s;lature &s;hall expre&s;ly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. THE freedom of deliberation, &s;peech and debate, in either hou&s;e of the legi&s;lature, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any ac|cu&s;ation or pro&s;ecution, action or complaint, in any other court or place what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. THE legi&s;lature ought frequently to a&s;&s;emble for the redre&s;s of grievances, for correcting, &s;trengthening, and confirming the laws and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. NO &s;ub&s;idy, charge, tax, impo&s;t, or duties, ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, fixed, laid, or levied under any pretext what&s;oever, without the con&s;ent of the people, or their re|pre&s;entatives in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. LAWS made to puni&s;h for actions done before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by proceding laws, are unju&s;t, expre&s;&s;ive, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental principles of a free go|vernment.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. NO &s;ubject ought, in any ca&s;e, or in any time to be declared guilty of trea&s;on or felony by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. NO magi&s;trate or court of law, &s;hall demand ex|ce&s;&s;ive bail or &s;ureties, impo&s;e exce&s;&s;ive fines, or inflict cruel or unu&s;ual puni&s;hments.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. IN time of peace no &s;oldier ought to be quar|tered in any hou&s;e without the con&s;ent of the owner; and in time of war &s;uch quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magi&s;trate, in a manner ordeined by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="13" REF="016845_0011_0F9EBECE3B7DF718">XXVIII. NO per&s;on can in any ca&s;e be &s;ubjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except tho&s;e employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual &s;ervice, but by authority of the legi|&s;lature.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. IT is e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit. It is therefore not only the be&s;t policy, but for the &s;ecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the &s;upreme judi|cial court &s;hould hold their offices as long as they behave them&s;elves well; and that they &s;hould have honorable &s;a|laries a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;tanding laws.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. IN the government of this Commonwealth, the legi&s;lative department &s;hall never exerci&s;e the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive &s;hall never exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative and judicial powers, or ei|ther of them: The judicial &s;hall never exerci&s;e the legi&s;|lative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.</P>

<P>THE people inhabiting the territory formerly called the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, do hereby &s;o|lemnly and mutually agree with each other, to form them|&s;elves into a free, &s;overeign, and independent body-politic or &s;tate, by the name of THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.</P>
