<P>AT a juncture like the pre&s;ent; when the na|tional reputation of Britain, as well as her ab&s;olute &s;afety, &s;tands tottering on the brink of de&s;truction; when liberty and freedom, the great pillars of the con&s;titution, are, by force and fraud undermined, and tumbling into ruins; when the bloody &s;word of tyranny is drawn again&s;t America, and &s;oon to be plunged into the bowels of her innocent inhabitants; when the pre&s;ent So|vereign, aided by a de&s;picable junto, the rebel, outca&s;t, and refu&s;e of Scotland, and a parliament not returned by the free &s;uffrages of the people, are rioting with impunity in the &s;poils of an in&s;ult|ed powerful kingdom; when they, by cruel op|pre&s;&s;ion, have &s;pread terror and civil war in every part of the Briti&s;h empire; when they have de|&s;troyed or &s;u&s;pended her trade, and &s;apped the credit of public &s;ecurity; when the mo&s;t iniquitous and unju&s;t laws are daily pa&s;&s;ed to curb the &s;pirit, and bind in chains, the hands of a brave and free
<PB N="34" REF="013936_0002_0F925DBACB7CC3F0">people; when St. James's is made the SLAUGH|TER HOUSE of AMERICA; when the Sover|eign is become a national executioner, and for a &s;ceptre carries a bloody knife; when by a mo&s;t &s;candalous and &s;hameful profu&s;ion of the public money, we are hourly robbed and plundered, to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of King-craft and villany; when new taxes are daily impo&s;ed upon the peo|ple in time of peace, to the almo&s;t entire ruin of the &s;tate; when the minions of de&s;poti&s;m a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> in|crea&s;ing the land forces, for the open and avowed purpo&s;e of wading knee deep in blood, through the liberties of Britain; when the Prote&s;tant religion is openly &s;ubverted, and the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in Canada deprived of tho&s;e great &s;ecurities of their per&s;onal liberty and property, the habeas corpus act, and trial by juries; when a &s;u&s;pending and di&s;pen&s;ing power is a&s;&s;umed by the crown; when oppo&s;ition, to the mo&s;t cruel and wanton acts of lawle&s;s power, is deemed rebellion; when the Senators, de&s;igned the protectors of the people, are become their de&s;troyers; when the appointed guardians of public freedom are become ba&s;e apo&s;tates, and con&s;pirators again&s;t the liberties of mankind; when neither oaths, nor con&s;cience, can bind the Sovereign or his Mini&s;ters; when both public and private ju&s;tice is denied to a &s;ubject, nay to the whole body of the people at large; when our lives are expo&s;ed to fal&s;e accu&s;a|tions, and our per&s;ons to arbitrary impri&s;onment, and heavy fines; when the judges before whom we are to &s;tand upon life and death, and before whom all ca&s;es, concerning liberty and property, mu&s;t be brought, too much devoted to the will and plea&s;ure of the crown, and enemies to the na|tural
<PB N="35" REF="013936_0003_0F925DBB79FEB5D0">rights of mankind; when juries, who are to decide our fate, packed, bribed, or modelled to the pernicious de&s;igns of a wicked and dete&s;table mini&s;try; when every po&s;t, civil, naval, and mi|litary, is filled by northern flatterers and their ad|herents, by men of no principles, by para&s;ites, pimps, catamites, and the advocates for arbitrary power; when the people can &s;ee nothing but mi&s;e|ry and &s;lavery before their eyes; when this va&s;t and mighty empire, the admiration and envy of the world, is, through corruption and villany, fallen into ruins.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a juncture as this, and under the&s;e dreadful and alarming circum&s;tances of experi|enced and impending danger, it becomes the duty of every Engli&s;hman to &s;tand forth to defend his life, his liberty, and his property from lawle&s;s vio|lence, and to &s;ave his country from perdition.</P>
<P>So highly did our brave and virtuous ance&s;tors value and e&s;teem their rights, liberties and privi|leges, that they &s;pared neither blood nor trea&s;ure in their defence, when invaded, as they too often were, by &s;ome of our Kings, who, in the pur|&s;uit of lawle&s;s power, pulled down all the fences of liberty, and broke in, like the pre&s;ent Sover|eign, upon the con&s;titution, &s;o far that the lives, liberties, and properties of the &s;ubjects of this realm were hourly in danger, and many fell &s;a|crifices to royal or mini&s;terial vengeance.</P>
<P>Then it was that our generous forefathers nobly a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves in defence of their in|herents and legal rights, and made an offering of the be&s;t and choice&s;t blood in the kingdom to the &s;hrine of Liberty, that we, their po&s;terity, might be free and happy. To them, and the glorious
<PB N="36" REF="013936_0004_0F925DBC5E230AC8">&s;truggles they made with power, we owe all the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, and the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, our greate&s;t boa&s;t, and their greate&s;t glory.</P>
<P>It was in &s;uch times as the&s;e, when our brave progenitors behaved like Britons, with a true pa|triot zeal, with which almo&s;t every brea&s;t was fired, they &s;purned the yoke, and broke the chains that were prepared for them, letting their king and his minions know, they would not &s;uf|fer him nor them to de&s;troy their birthrights, and di&s;pen&s;e with the known laws of the land, by which they were re&s;olved to be governed, and not by his will, or any other lawle&s;s power upon earth.</P>
<P>Let us at this time, in this hour of imminent danger, follow &s;o bright and glorious an example, by a well timed noble re&s;i&s;tance to the pre&s;ent royal and mini&s;terial plan, for &s;ubverting the laws and religion, and overturning the con&s;titu|tion of the Briti&s;h empire, in England and Ame|rica; a re&s;i&s;tance that will &s;ecure freedom to po&s;te|rity, and immortal honor to our&s;elves; the field of glory is open before us; let us rou&s;e from a &s;tate of apathy, and exert our&s;elves in a manner becoming of Engli&s;hmen, worthy of men who love liberty, and de&s;erve to be free. Let us &s;hew to the world, we are not to be en&s;laved by one, nor by five thou&s;and tyrants, for the &s;ons of cru|elty, corruption, and de&s;poti&s;m will pur&s;ue their bloody de&s;igns, with greater vigour, and with all the unrelenting malice of barbarians, again&s;t our fellow &s;ubjects in America, in proportion as we are tame and acquie&s;cing; and if once they can &s;ucceed, through our ba&s;ene&s;s and cowardice, the &s;word will be immediately turned again&s;t us, the
<PB N="37" REF="013936_0005_0F925DBD12406CA0">&s;acred con&s;titution of our empire di&s;&s;olved, and we &s;hall fall de&s;pi&s;ed, unlamented, and dete&s;ted, into the &s;ame horrible gulph of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>Let us take advantage of the pre&s;ent opportuni|ty, while our re&s;entments boil high, while every Engli&s;h brea&s;t is fired with indignation again&s;t tho&s;e who are the authors of all our pa&s;t and pre&s;ent cala|mities, which now convul&s;e the &s;tate to its centre; let us by all proper, ju&s;t, and legal means, exem|plary puni&s;h the paricides, and avowed enemies of mankind; let neither private acquaintance, nor per&s;onal alliance, &s;tand between us and our duty to our country; let all, who have an intere&s;t in the public &s;afety, join in common mea&s;ures to defend the publc &s;afety; let us pur&s;ue to di&s;grace, de&s;truc|tion, and even death, all tho&s;e who have brought this ruin upon us, let them be ever &s;o great or ever &s;o many; let us &s;tamp, and deep engrave in cha|racters legible to all Europe at pre&s;ent, and to all po&s;terity hereafter, what vengeance is due to crimes, which have no le&s;s objects in view than the ruin of nations, and the de&s;truction of millions; let us fru&s;trate their pre&s;ent de&s;perate and wicked attempt to de&s;troy America, by joining with our injured fellow &s;ubjects, and bravely &s;triking one hone&s;t and bold &s;troke to de&s;troy them; nay, although the de&s;igns of the con&s;pirators &s;hould be laid deep as the centre, although they &s;hould rai&s;e hell it&s;elf, and &s;hould fetch legions of votaries from thence to avow their proceedings, yet let us not leave the pur|&s;uit till we have their heads and their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>Hear part of the addre&s;s of your injured and oppre&s;&s;ed fellow &s;ubjects in America, to you upon this melancholy occa&s;ion, upon the dreadful pro&s;|pect of impending ruin; then let every Engli&s;h|man lay his hand upon his heart, and declare whe|ther
<PB N="38" REF="013936_0006_0F925DBDBB8A2060">he does not think they have been mo&s;t cruelly treated, and whether he can in ju&s;tice, con&s;cience, and humanity draw the &s;word again&s;t them; or whether he would not rather join with them, and endeavour to obtain a deci&s;ive victory over ty|ranny, or fall gloriou&s;ly with the liberties of his country. The&s;e are their words.</P>
<P>"When a nation, led to greatne&s;s by the hand of liberty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the glory that he|roi&s;m, munificence, and humanity can be&s;tow, de|&s;cends to the ungrateful ta&s;k of forging chains for her friends and children, and in&s;tead of giving &s;up|port to freedom, turns advocate for &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;he has either cea&s;ed to be virtuous, or been extremely negligent in the appointment of her rulers.</P>
<P>"In almo&s;t every age, in repeated conflicts, in long and bloody wars, as well civil as foreign, again&s;t the many powerful nations, again&s;t the open a&s;&s;aults of enemies, and the more dangerous trea|chery of friends, have the inhabitants of your i&s;land, your great and glorious ance&s;tors, maintained their independence, and tran&s;mitted the rights of men, and the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, to you their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>"Be not &s;urpri&s;ed, therefore, that we who are de&s;cendents from the &s;ame common ance&s;tors; that we, who&s;e forefathers participated in all the rights, the liberties, and the con&s;titution, you &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t, and who have carefully conveyed the &s;ame fair inheritance to us, guarantied by the plighted faith of government, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn compacts with Briti&s;h &s;overeigns, &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;urrender them to men, who found their claims on no prin|ciples of rea&s;on, and who pro&s;ecute them with a de&s;ign, that by having our lives and property in
<PB N="39" REF="013936_0007_0F925DBF2532FAD0">their power, they may, with the greater facility, en&s;lave you.</P>
<P>"The cau&s;e of America is now the object of uni|ver&s;al attention; it has at length become very &s;e|rious. This unhappy country has not only been oppre&s;&s;ed, but abu&s;ed and mi&s;repre&s;ented; and the duty we owe to our&s;elves and po&s;terity, to your intere&s;t, and the general welfare of the Briti&s;h empire, leads us to addre&s;s you on this very impor|tant &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"We call upon you your&s;elves, to witne&s;s our loyalty and attachment to the common intere&s;t of the whole empire; did we not, in the la&s;t war, add all the &s;trength of this va&s;t continent to the force which repelled our common enemy? Did we not leave our native &s;hores, and meet di&s;ea&s;e and death, to pro|mote the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in foreign cli|mates? Did you not thank us for our zeal, and even reimbur&s;e us large &s;ums of money, which, you con|fe&s;&s;ed, we had advanced beyond our proportion, and far beyond our abilities? You did.</P>
<P>"To what cau&s;es, then, are we to attribute the &s;udden change of treatment, and that &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery which was prepared for us at the re&s;tora|tion of peace.</P>
<P>"Let ju&s;tice and humanity cea&s;e to be the boa&s;t of your nation, con&s;ult your hi&s;tory, examine your hi&s;tory, examine your records of former tran&s;actions, nay turn to the annals of the many arbitrary &s;tates and kingdoms that &s;urround you, and &s;hew us a &s;ingle in&s;tance of men being condemned to &s;uffer for imputed crimes, unheard, unque&s;tioned, and without even the &s;pecious formality of a trial; and that too by laws made expre&s;ly for the purpo&s;e, and which had no exi&s;tence at the time of the fact committed. If it be difficult to reconcile the&s;e proceedings to
<PB N="40" REF="013936_0008_0F925DBF5AAF38F8">the genius and temper of your laws and con&s;titu|tion, the ta&s;k will become more arduous when we call upon our mini&s;terial enemies to ju&s;tify, not only condemning men untried, and by hear&s;ay; but involving the innocent in one common puni&s;h|ment with the guilty, and for the act of thirty or forty, to bring poverty, di&s;tre&s;s and calamity on 30,000 &s;ouls, and tho&s;e not your enemies, but your friends, brethren, and fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>"Admit that the mini&s;try, by the power of Britain, and the aid of our Roman Catholic neigh|bours, &s;hould be able to carry the point of taxa|tion, and reduce us to a &s;tate of perfect humilia|tion and &s;lavery. Such an enterprize would doubt|le&s;s make &s;ome addition to your national debt, which already pre&s;&s;es down your liberties, and fills you with pen&s;ioners and placemen, We pre|&s;ume al&s;o that your commerce will &s;omewhat be dimini&s;hed. However, &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould prove victorious&mdash;in what condition will you then be? What advantages or what laurels will you reap from &s;uch a conque&s;t?</P>
<P>May not a mini&s;try with the &s;ame armies en&s;lave you&mdash;it may be &s;aid, you will cea&s;e to pay them&mdash; but remember the taxes from America, the wealth, and we may add the men particularly the Roman Catholics of this va&s;t continent, will then be in the power of your enemies&mdash;nor will you have any rea&s;on to expect, that after making &s;laves of us, many among us &s;hould refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re|ducing you to the &s;ame abject &s;tate,"</P>
