<P>_THE Books of the <HI>Chronicles</HI> are (as Expo&s;itors ob&s;erve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool, Henry.</NOTE>) &s;uppo&s;ed on good grounds, to have been penn'd by <HI>Ezra,</HI> that ready Scribe in the law of the LORD: And the time when he wrote them, to have been after the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity. This Second Book begins with the reign of <HI>Solomon,</HI> who &s;ucceeded his Father <HI>David,</HI> and gives us the Hi&s;tory of the reigns of the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> from him to the Captivity. This and the preceeding Chapter give us an account, of the reign of a very good and gracious King, viz. <HI>Jo&s;iah.</HI> They in|form
<PB N="2" REF="002847_0003_0FE64561907DBDA0">us, at what age he came to the Throne, what great and good things he did, after his advancement thereto, how &s;uddenly he died, where he was interr'd, and how univer&s;ally lamented by his Subjects at his Death. This good King came to the Throne, when he was young: See <HI>ver.</HI> 1. of the preceeding Chapter. <HI>Jo&s;iah was eight years old when he began to reign &amp;c.</HI> And he was advanced thereto, after two very wicked Kings, <HI>viz.</HI> his Grand-father <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> and his Father <HI>Amon:</HI> but yet he did not tread in their &s;teps; for we read, <HI>that he did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left:</HI> And that <HI>in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to &s;eek after the God of David his father.</HI> See <HI>ver.</HI> 2, 3. of that Chapter. This young King then went on to purge <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> from the high Places, and the groves, the carved Images, and the molten Images; he al&s;o cau&s;ed the altars of <HI>Baalim</HI> to be broke down in his pre&s;ence, and the Images that were above them to be cut down; and al&s;o gave order, and took effectual care, for the repairing the Tem|ple &amp;c. as we may &s;ee by reading that Chapter. And then in this Chapter, in which is the text, we read of a <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> which this godly King kept in the eighteenth Year of his reign; how he encouraged, &amp; directed the Prie&s;ts &amp; Levites in it; gave very liberally him&s;elf towards the charge of it; and in a word, how very &s;olemnly and exactly the whole of it was performed: See <HI>ver.</HI> 1,&mdash;19.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002847_0004_0FE6760EE494A790">
AND now, how happy might it have been for his Subjects, could he have reigned longer over them, and have been &s;par'd, to perfect the glo|rious things he had begun? But it mu&s;t be o|therwi&s;e; and behold, as great and good as he is, yet he is not &s;uffer'd to continue, but is cut off in the mid&s;t of his days and u&s;efulne&s;s, and his Subjects &s;urprized with the &s;udden and un|expected News of it. His Death indeed was brought upon him, partly through his own ra&s;h|ne&s;s and pre&s;umption; for when <HI>Necho</HI> King of Egypt, came up to fight with <HI>Carchemi&s;h</HI> by Euphrates, <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> would then go out again&s;t him; and though the King of Egypt &s;ent to warn him again&s;t the Enterprize, yet engage he would, and in per&s;on fight the Egyptian Army, and in the engagement receives tho&s;e wounds of which he died: See <HI>ver.</HI> 20,&mdash;23. <Q>But yet it was not in wrath to him, (as one ob&s;erves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Henry.</NOTE>) for his heart was upright before God, but in wrath to a &s;inful, and hypocritical Nation, that God &s;uffered their King to act thus.</Q> The King they had was a good one, and one they did not prize eno', and God would let them no longer enjoy him, but in anger takes him away from them. Now in the text we read, that <HI>he was buried in one of the &s;epulchres of his fathers; and all Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for him.</HI> And ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning had they under &s;uch a frown of Providence on them.

<P>TO make a reflection or two, before we pro|ceed, &mdash;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. INFER we from hence, how fading and &s;hort liv'd the greate&s;t Worldly Honours are. Honour is what Men are fond of, and pur&s;ue; and who have more and greater Honours con|ferred upon them, than the Kings of the Earth? But now, mu&s;t they die as well as others, how &s;hort liv'd then are the greate&s;t Honours here below? Of the&s;e may it be &s;aid they al&s;o are vanity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. SEE what little rea&s;on, the greate&s;t Men have, to boa&s;t or be proud on the account of their worldly grandeur. How apt is worldly grandeur to make men giddy? and what danger, of being too much elevated, are per&s;ons often in, when perhaps they have but tho&s;e honours paid them, that are ju&s;tly due to them? But now, what a mortifying con&s;ideration &s;hould this be to the greate&s;t of Men, to remember that notwith&s;tanding all their worldly gran|deur, yet er'e long they mu&s;t die like meaner men, and be laid with others in the &s;ilent Grave?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. WHAT we have heard &s;hould teach us, not to put too much tru&s;t in, nor expect too much from, the greate&s;t of Men what&s;oever.
<PB N="10" REF="002847_0011_0FE675F04FB3BAC8">Are they all mortal? mu&s;t they die as well as others, and even Kings not e&s;cape? then &s;ure, we &s;hould <HI>cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils;</HI> and <HI>not put our trust in Kings, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom their is no help,</HI> &s;ince <HI>his breath will in a little while go forth, and he return to his earth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. WHAT we have heard, might afford a loud call to all &s;uch as rule over men, to dili|gence and fidelity in their work. The work of Civil Rulers is great and weighty: and what can be a greater excitation to them, to an&s;wer the Character they bear, and faithfully, and diligently improve all they have for the honour of God, and good of them, over whom they rule, than this con&s;ideration, <HI>viz.</HI> That they mu&s;t die as well as others? This &s;hould make them <HI>just, ruling in the fear of God.</HI></ITEM>

<P>I come now to</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>THAT Kings &amp; Princes are &s;ome|times removed by Death, in the mid&s;t of their Ser|vice &amp; U&s;efulne&s;s.</HI> God, who &s;ets up Kings, and who has appointed rule and government among men, has done this, for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of his people. Such are to &s;erve the People, over whom they are placed; and therein do they &s;erve God, who has &s;o dignified, and advanced them. And this God, who has &s;et them up, can when he plea&s;es, put them down again<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Dan. 2.21.</NOTE>. <HI>He changeth the times and &s;ea&s;ons; he remov|eth Kings, and he &s;etteth up Kings.</HI> Now Death &s;ometimes calls the&s;e off, in the mid&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="002847_0012_0FE676191B75D4B8">of their Service, and U&s;efulne&s;s; and when the greate&s;t things are expected from them. They may &s;eek the real welfare of their Subjects, and be exerting them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, for their peace and &s;ecurity; and in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e, Death may put an end to their purpo&s;es and de&s;igns. So have &s;ome of the Kings of God's ancient People been taken away, and e&s;pecially that good one, of whom our text &s;peaks; his Predece&s;&s;or was his father <HI>Amon,</HI> and he did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, as his father <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> before him had done, he &s;acri|ficed to all the carved Images, which <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> his father had &s;et up; But when this King <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> came to the throne, he quickly began a Refor|mation; he repaired the Hou&s;e of the Lord, which had lain wa&s;te, and many other things: but yet in the mid&s;t of all this, is he &s;natch'd away. And thus have &s;ome of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> been taken away. Thus was King WILLIAM the Third removed by Death, in a critical juncture, when the Nations hopes and expectations from him were greatly rais'd. But not to go back &s;o far; how was our late KING, of ble&s;&s;ed Memory, taken from us in the mid&s;t of his Service and U&s;efulne&s;s; he Died indeed in an advanced Age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the 68th Year of his Age.</NOTE>; but yet in the mid&s;t of his Serviceablene&s;s; and when his Dominions, who for near. Thirteen Years had been happy under him, hopd to have been &s;o &s;till; and had their expectations in and from him greatly rais'd: How was he pur&s;uing the Peace and Tranquility of <HI>Europe,</HI> when to our inexpre&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="12" REF="002847_0013_0FE675F180A8DA90">grief, the tydings of his decea&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which was on the Lord's-Day <HI>June</HI> 11th. about Three in the Morning at His Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Palace at <HI>O&s;nabrug</HI></NOTE> are brought to us? We &s;ee then that Kings and Princes may die in the mid&s;t of their Service and U&s;efulne&s;s? Which was the Third <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>THAT whenever &s;uch are thus re|moved by Death, it is God that in his holy, and all|wi&s;e Providence orders and appoints it.</HI> That the World is governed by God, is as true as that He made it; and nothing is there comes to pa&s;s in it, but what is of his ordering. Chance and Fortune are but fancies and delu&s;ions, and nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than to &s;uppo&s;e or imagine the World to be governed by them. And this God, who thus governs the World, is holy, ju&s;t and wi&s;e, in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence. Now, whatever Changes there are in Nations Kingdoms or Countries, they are all ordered by him. Indeed GOD generally makes u&s;e of In&s;truments and &s;econd Cau&s;es, in bring|ing about his purpo&s;es and de&s;igns; but then, he is him&s;elf the prime Efficient of all, and he don't reckon it beneath him, to concern him&s;elf even with the &s;malle&s;t matters: For our Savi|our has a&s;&s;ur'd us<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 10.29, 30.</NOTE> that not &s;o much <HI>as a &s;parrow falls to the ground without him,</HI> and that the very <HI>hairs of our head are all numbred.</HI> God orders the time both of every ones birth, and al&s;o death. The times of all, of Princes and Subjects are in his hands. Kings mu&s;t and &s;hall die, but not before God's time. They
<PB N="13" REF="002847_0014_0FE6761A44B32FA0">may die &s;uddenly, in the mid&s;t of their days, before their own, and their People's time, but not before God's. He orders their Death, whi|ther it be more lingeringly, or &s;uddenly, at home, or abroad, in their bed, or in the field; he or|ders the &s;ickne&s;s, accident, or the like, by which a period is put to their lives. He &s;ent pining &s;ickne&s;s on <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> and he directed the arrow which wounded <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> &s;o that he died. But this for the Fourth <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, is it thus, with what &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion doth it become both our Nation, and Land, to bear the rebuke of God's Providence, in the Death of our late rightful and lawful King? His removal is certainly an awful re|buke both on them and us, and will as &s;uch be re&s;ented by every true Prote&s;tant, &mdash; but what &s;hall we &s;ay&mdash; Lord! thou who ha&s;t given ha&s;t al&s;o taken away; and we would be dumb, and not open our mouths to complain.</P>
<P>I come now to</P>
<P>PROP. V. <HI>THAT the removal by Death of &s;uch Kings from a Nation or People, is what they ought duly to re&s;ent and mourn for.</HI> Such a di&s;pen&s;a|tion calls for &s;orrow and lamentation, for weep|ing, and girding on of &s;ackcloth.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider here briefly,</P>
<P>GOOD Kings are great Ble&s;&s;ings to their Sub|jects; and therefore their Death to be lament|ed. They &s;eek the good of the People they
<PB N="14" REF="002847_0015_0FE675F1A6D786F8">are &s;et over, and are indeed Benefactors to them. Such Kings, as they expect love, honour and loyalty from their Subjects, &s;o they endeavour to be them&s;elves <HI>nur&s;ing fathers</HI> unto them, which was the great ble&s;&s;ing God promi&s;ed his People of old, that they &s;hould have in their Kings. <HI>Kings &s;halt be thy nur&s;ing fathers, and Queens thy nur&s;ing mothers &amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 49.23.</NOTE> They are their Subjects Patrons and Protectors, always tender of their intere&s;ts and liberties, and ready to defend them from all inva&s;ions. And what great ble&s;&s;ings are &s;uch Kings to a People, and their Death of con&s;equence to be lamented by them?</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Death of a good King is cer|tainly a frown of Heaven on a People, and to be lamented by them. When God frowns on a People they ought to mourn: and he doth &s;o in the removal of &s;uch a King from their Head. At &s;uch a time it is a day of darkne&s;s and of gloomine&s;s, a day of clouds and thick darkne&s;s with a People: and &s;ure not to re&s;ent &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;ation would be &s;tupidity in them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Death of a good King, and in the mid&s;t of his U&s;efulne&s;s, is &s;ometimes a fore|runner of &s;ore Judgments coming upon a Peo|ple. GOD, when about to bring his Judgments upon a &s;inful People, u&s;ually gives warning, and makes to appear the evident Progno&s;ticks of them; and &s;ometimes the Death of a good King may be the forerunner of dreadful Judg|ments coming upon a People. The Prophet &s;aith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 57.1.</NOTE> <HI>that the Righteous one is taken away from the
<PB N="15" REF="002847_0016_0FE6761A6C180E30">evil to come.</HI> So may a good King be taken a|way, and we find GOD promi&s;ing to defer bringing on <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> tho&s;e Judg|ments which they de&s;erved. 'till that Godly King <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> was gathered to his Fathers. 2 Kin. 22.15. to the end of the Chap. <HI>And &s;he &s;aid un|to them, thus &s;aith the GOD of I&s;rael, tell the man that &s;ent you to me, thus &s;aith the Lord, behold. I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the in|habitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the King of</HI> Judah <HI>hath read. Becau&s;e they have for&s;aken me and have burnt incen&s;e unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands: therefore my wroth &s;hall be kindled against this place, and &s;hall not be quenched. But to the King of Judah, which &s;ent you to inquire of the Lord, thus &s;hall ye &s;ay to him, thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael as touching the words which thou ha&s;t heard; becau&s;e thine heart was tender, and thou ha&s;t humbled thy &s;elf before the Lord, when thou hearde&s;t what I &s;pake against this place, and again&s;t the inhabitants thereof, that they &s;hould become a de&s;olation and a cau&s;e and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me: I al&s;o have heard thee &s;aith the Lord. Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou &s;halt be gathered into thy grave in peace, and thine eyes &s;hall not &s;ee all the evil that I will bring upon this place.</HI> And one great rea&s;on why the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> &s;o lamented the Death of <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> as we &s;ee he did, in the ver&s;e following our text, was becau&s;e he was &s;en&s;ible of the evil which was apace ha&s;t|ning upon God's &s;inful People. And it was not a great while after King <HI>Jo&s;iah's</HI> Death, before we find Judah and Jeru&s;alem in ruins. There
<PB N="16" REF="002847_0017_0FE675F6EE744DB0">were but four Kings reigned, and two of them but three months each, before Judah and Jeru|&s;alem were de&s;troyed by the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> the Hou&s;e of God burnt with fire, and all the Ve&s;|&s;els of it carried into Babylon; as we may &s;ee by reading the 36th. Chapter of this 2d. Book of <HI>Chronicles.</HI> Thus is the Death of a good King &s;ometimes the pre&s;age and forerunner of approaching Judgments and Calamities, and therefore to be Lamented.</P>
<P>AGAIN, To mourn for and lament the Death of a good King is one mark of the Subjects love and loyalty to him. As good Kings are a great ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven to a People, &s;o it is no le&s;s a favour to a godly Prince when the Subjects un|der his Dominion are ready on all occa&s;ions to expre&s;s their love and loyalty to him; when under him they <HI>lend quiet and peaccable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty,</HI> are careful to main|tain his honour and dignity, and ready to venture both their e&s;tates and fives, if call'd thereto in his defence. Now one mark of the Subjects love and loyalty to their Prince, is to mourn heartily at his Death.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Thus to mourn at the Death of a good King is a piece of honour ju&s;tly due to him. Honour is due to Kings; and we are bid to honour them in God's word. See 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Honour the King.</HI> And e&s;pecially is this honour due to &s;uch as are <HI>nur&s;ing fathers</HI> to their People. And this honour is due to them both while living, and at their death. The memory of &s;uch &s;hould be had in an honourable and la&s;ting
<PB N="17" REF="002847_0018_0FE67623088AB8C8">remembrance. When <HI>Hezekiah</HI> died, we read how his Subjects did him honour at his Death. See 2 Chron. 32.33. <HI>And Hezekiah &s;lept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem did him honour at his death.</HI> Doubtle&s;s (&s;aith one on the text) <Q>part of the honour which they did him then was to mourn for him.</Q> Subjects honour their decea&s;ed King at his Death, when they mourn and lament his removal from them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, To lament and mourn at the Death of a good King has been the practice of God's People both in former and latter ages. So have the People of God done in former times: and what an inftance of this have we in our text, and the foregoing ver&s;e.&mdash; <HI>All Judah and Jeru|&s;alem lamented for Jo&s;iah; and all the &s;inging men and &s;inging women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah in their lamen|tations.</HI> And we find that when <HI>Abijah</HI> died, who was <HI>Jereboam's</HI> Son, and in whom there was found &s;ome good thing toward the Lord of I&s;rael; and who was al&s;o heir apparent to the Crown, all I&s;rael mourned for him. See 1 Kin. 14.18. <HI>And they buried him</HI> (i.e. Abijah) <HI>and all I&s;rael mourned for him according to the word of the Lord &amp;c.</HI> Thus has it been the practice of God's People in ancient times. &mdash; And thus it has been in latter ages al&s;o. So hath the Death of a good King &s;ometimes put our whole Na|tion into Mourning, witne&s;s the decea&s;e of that glorious King, WILLIAM the Third, of glori|ous Memory; the lamentations made at who&s;e Funeral are not forgot to this day.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002847_0019_0FE675F7173018A0">
I might go on and &s;ay,</P>
<P>THAT the Death of a good King oftentimes gives &s;uch as are enemies to the State great advantages again&s;t them; and is therefore to be lamented. But I need not in&s;i&s;t here, the&s;e things con&s;idered, may &s;erve to &s;how that it is the duty of a People to re&s;ent and lay to heart the Death of a good King: and &s;o for clearing the Fifth and la&s;t <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>HERE then for the U&s;e and Improvement of it I &s;hall only &s;ay,</P>
<P>USE. IS it as we have heard? <HI>THEN &s;ure GOD is this Day calling both our Nations at Home, and our&s;elves in this Land, to lay to heart and be &s;uitably affected with the Death of our late Good and Gracious</HI> KING.</P>
<P>WE have had brought us the la&s;t Week, the heavy tydings of the Death of one of the be&s;t of Princes; our late rightful and lawful King GEORGE. News, very melancholy and &s;ur|prizing to us, and becau&s;e of which we mourn this Day.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, how vain it would be in me to imagine my &s;elf capable of giving the ju&s;t Character of &s;o great a Prince, nor &s;hall I attempt it; but yet I think Duty to GOD by whom he reigned, and Loyalty to my King oblige me to &s;ay &mdash; That doubtle&s;s he was a KING richly furni&s;hed with Princely gifts and qualifications, a true Prote&s;tant, and indeed a Defender of the Faith; &mdash; a KING
<PB N="19" REF="002847_0020_0FE676232B91A020">meek and mild, wi&s;e and prudent, &s;teddy and unwearied, of quick di&s;patch in all publick Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and who &s;corned to do any thing mean, and unbecoming the high Character that he bare &mdash; a KING, who had the good and wel|fare of his Subjects always near his heart, and who has many a time from the Throne (and not only in word but deed al&s;o) expre&s;s'd the &s;ame. &mdash; a KING, under who&s;e ju&s;t &amp; mild admini|&s;trations his Subjects were all ea&s;y, unle&s;s a few unrea&s;onable men, whom nothing would con|tent, but &s;uch things as would de&s;troy the Con|&s;titution, Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and bury the Nation in Popery, blood and ruin. &mdash; And &s;ure then the Death of &s;uch a Prince is an awful frown of Heaven both on our Nation and Land; and God is this Day calling both us and them to weeping and to mourning. It is but a few Years, &s;ince our hearts were fill'd with gladne&s;s, at the joyful News of his Ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne. And how did we then hope to &s;it under his &s;hadow for a long &s;ea&s;on? But alas! our hopes are da&s;h'd and gone; the breath of our no&s;trils is &s;topt; the anointed of the Lord taken, and conquered by Death that cruel enemy. And is he gone? Is that royal Head which once &s;hin'd &s;o glori|ou&s;ly under <HI>England's</HI> Crown, now laid in the Du&s;t? Can tho&s;e Hands and Feet which once were &s;o ready to &s;erve us, be no more employ'd for our welfare and good? Is that royal Body now become a lifele&s;s Corp&s;e, and nothing but a lump of cold clay? Mu&s;t it be laid in the Du&s;t, and we &s;ee that face no more? &mdash; Lament then and weep all ye his dutiful and loyal Sub|jects,

Yea let every one be &s;uitably affected with this lo&s;s, and hearken to the voice of God in this Providence which loudly utters it &s;elf to us in that language, P&s;al. 146.3, 4. <HI>Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man in whom there is no help: his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> And that, I&s;ai. 2.22. <HI>Cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, for wherein is he to be accounted of.</HI> God is now &s;hewing his People how vain it is to put too much confidence in the be&s;t of Princes, which perhaps is what we have &s;ometimes been ready to do. And now to &s;tir up our grief, let us but con&s;ider, what a critical Juncture of Affairs he is &s;narch'd away in. There have been of late Months great Commotions in <HI>Europe,</HI> Wars and rumours of Wars among the Nations, and dark Clouds hanging over them. This (with other things) called his Maje&s;ty abroad; and behold, while he is in pur&s;uit of the Peace and Tranquility of his People, is he taken away from them; and tho' he or they little thought that their parting a few days before would be a final farewel; yet &s;o it proved, and well may they now &s;orrow, becau&s;e <HI>they mu&s;t &s;ee his face no more.</HI></P>

<ITEM>1. LET us ble&s;s GOD for him, and the great things he has done for his People in and by him.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Taken from the <HI>London Journal, June</HI> 17. 1727.]</HEAD>
<P>THE Mortality of Princes is a Subject that demands &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s from the lighte&s;t Minds: Who is vain and carele&s;s enough, to be able to expel &s;adne&s;s from his Heart, when the &s;acred Head of Maje&s;ty is laid low in Du&s;t? The ordinary Con&s;olations of Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy are ineffectual to cha&s;ti&s;e the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of Grief in a pious People, mourning for their King and Father. All that we can think, and &s;peak, and write, is too little to expre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion in the Soul; and Extravagance it &s;elf does not mean half enough. Tho&s;e Con&s;iderations only that are taken from the Nece&s;&s;ity of Submi&s;&s;ion to the Divine Will, which is eternally mov'd by infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, are of Force to re&s;train the Rage and Intemperance of the Mind, when it finds it &s;elf wounded in its ten|dere&s;t Part, and throbs in the fir&s;t Agonies of de&s;perate Sorrow. What &s;trange, what &s;ecret Charms are there in hopele&s;s Grief, when the Heart is grown wilful to its own Affiction, and refu&s;es Comfort? Will the Reader therefore indulge the Pa&s;&s;ion of an hone&s;t Mind, which delights to linger on the melancholy Scene, and mingle his Affliction with that of a whole People.</P>
<P>A Thou&s;and unwelcome <HI>Expre&s;&s;es</HI> have e'er this publi&s;h'd through all <HI>Europe,</HI> that <HI>GEORGE</HI>
<PB REF="002847_0026_0FE676275D4A7190">THE GOOD AND JUST, is now no more a King; in who&s;e Lo&s;s <HI>Britain</HI> bewails her common Parent, and every Good Man a Friend and Patron. He is fallen from the mo&s;t exalted Heighth of human Greatne&s;s; from the Power of redre&s;&s;ing Wrongs, of protecting Innocence, and rai&s;ing fallen Virtue; and is gone to the Tribunal of the Almighty KING, to be him&s;elf judg'd, and to render an exact Account of his Vicegerency on Earth: his &s;acred Per&s;on is al|ready beginning to re&s;olve it &s;elf to common Clay, its fir&s;t Original: Who now &s;hall re|joice in his Smiles, or &s;tand &s;ilent in his Anger? Where is that maje&s;tick Face, which has ever aw'd his Foes, and chear'd his willing faithful Servants? That Scepter'd Hand, which Crowds of kneeling Subjects lately ki&s;s'd, how remi&s;s is it now in Death! How &s;udden, how awful is this Change! Scarce had we pa&s;s'd the Solem|nities for the Anniver&s;ary of his au&s;picious Birth, but we are call'd to pay our filial Sorrows o'er his Tomb. Who that had beheld the Splendor that fill'd the Court and this whole Metropolis on that happy Night, could have imagin'd &s;o &s;peedy, &s;o &s;evere a rever&s;al of our Joys? We then beheld our King in a &s;eeming firm Health, in full Vigour, and &s;o &s;anguine and florid a Complexion, as promis'd many more Years than he had yet attain'd. But we &s;hall behold him now no more for ever! <HI>Vanity</HI> is the ju&s;t In&s;cription on all humane Happine&s;s; and the reflection of the in&s;pir'd Writer on the natural frailty of Princes, ought for ever to correct tho&s;e tow'ring and &s;plendid Expectati|ons, which we form from their Virtue and Wi&s;|dom;
<PB REF="002847_0027_0FE6760075CC7218"><HI>I have &s;aid ye are Gods, and all of ye are children of the mo&s;t high, but ye &s;hall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</HI></P>
<P>REST for ever Royal Spirit, and po&s;&s;e&s;s what thou art no longer &s;en&s;ible of, the Prai&s;es and Ble&s;&s;ings of a grateful People, who &s;hall tran&s;mit the Story of thy gentle clement Reign, for the Example and In&s;truction of future Kings, and the Admiration of all Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>FAR be it from our pre&s;ent De&s;ign to draw at large the amiable Character of his late Maje&s;ty. Ala&s;s! as <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> &s;aid, <HI>We come to bury</HI> Cae&s;ar, <HI>not to prai&s;e him.</HI> But that Writer who &s;hall be honour'd with &s;o great a Task hereafter, will run no hazard of offending Truth, when he &s;hall enumerate the great Qualities that have di&s;tingui&s;hed the be&s;t &amp; happie&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Princes, &amp; unite them in the Per&s;on of <HI>GEORGE</HI> the Fir&s;t: Yet even this &s;hall fall &s;hort of his real Merit, and the publick Prai&s;e &s;hall make the Panegyrick little.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eem to be four Particulars in the Cha|racter of the late King, which di&s;tingui&s;h him from all the Princes his Predece&s;&s;ors, and &s;hall for ever endear his Memory to this Nation. The fir&s;t was the ab&s;olute want of all Ambition which might po&s;&s;ibly endanger the Liberties of his Subjects: A Rock on which the greate&s;t Kings have frequently mi&s;carried; but which was always &s;o carefully avoided by him, that in an Admini&s;tration of Thirteen Years, the mo&s;t jealous Patriots have not been able to form one
<PB REF="002847_0028_0FE6762786E526E8">rea&s;onable Fear concerning it. The &s;econd was his inflexible Con&s;tancy and Re&s;olution in tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, which upon mature Deliberation he had embrac'd: This added extreamly to the Importance of his Councils, by creating and &s;trengthning the Dependance and Confidence of his Allies abroad, as well as his Friends and Servants at home; and &s;eems to have been, next to the di&s;tingui&s;hing favour of Heaven, the prin|cipal Cau&s;e of all that Succe&s;s that ever attend|ed his Affairs. The third Particular in his Cha|racter was the indelible Remembrance he pre|&s;erv'd of the Services &amp; Fidelity of his Friends: He was a Ma&s;ter, that no Time, no Accidents, not &s;carce even Injuries could di&s;oblige; &s;o that it was no wonder that he was happy in Servants, whom no Advantages, no Intere&s;ts, no future Pro&s;pects could &s;educe from him. The la&s;t that I &s;hall now mention, for I ha&s;ten over &s;o painful and unea&s;y a Subject, was his mo&s;t graceful and obliging Conde&s;cen&s;ion to all: The King was every where to be known by his Goodne&s;s. Who can recollect his affable Deportment, his gracious bending to Di&s;tre&s;s, without being overwhelm'd &amp; lo&s;t in Sorrow! &mdash; I add no more.</P>
<P>LET us now with one Heart transfer our whole Faith and Loyalty to the Per&s;on of our pre&s;ent Sovereign; and paying him all that Fealty and Allegiance which is due to his un|doubted Title, we may with the firme&s;t Confi|dence expect that Favour and Protection which good and gracious Princes extend to a loyal and obedient People.</P>
