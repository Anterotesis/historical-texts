<HEAD>A brief and &s;orrowful Account of the pre&s;ent State of the Churches in NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Beauty and Strength of a Community (e&s;pecially Eccle&s;ia&s;tical) con&s;i&s;ts in nothing more, than in the Harmony of it's Members. This has been the di&s;|tingui&s;hing Glory of the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches in general, from the Days of our Fore-fathers, who, under GOD, planted the Go&s;pel at the Peril of their Lives, in this <HI>American</HI> Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But now, alas too &s;oon! Strife and Contention is come upon us like a Flood, which threatens the overthrow of all Order, and the utter &s;ubver|&s;ion of our Go&s;pel Con&s;titution. This gives us Occa&s;ion to take up the Lamen|tation as of old and &s;ay, <HI>How is the Gold become dim, and the fine Gold changed? How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of Zion with a Cloud in his Anger, and ca&s;t down from Heaven to the Earth the Beauty of I&s;rael? The Crown is fallen from our Head, wo to us that we have &s;inned!</HI> But is our Con|dition now indeed &s;uch, that there are none of the Sons which we have brought up, found worthy to lead us by the Hand and give Conduct to the&s;e Churches in this gloomy Day? Or &s;hall we re&s;ign them up to Stran|gers, and &s;et <HI>them</HI> at the Head of the Mini&s;try and our religious Affairs? Shall we imitate the Jewi&s;h Church in her Times of Degeneracy, and abundantly repleni&s;h our &s;elves from the Ea&s;t and other Quarters (tho' not with profe&s;s'd Sooth&s;ayers, yet) with enthu&s;ia&s;tick and erroneous Itinerant Preachers, and Tribes of publick Exhorters? It is an Error ea&s;ily imbib'd and practis'd upon, for Per&s;ons to value them&s;elves and others on Account of &s;udden Impre&s;&s;ions and Impul&s;es on the Mind, placing the&s;e in the room of the immediate Dictates and Influences of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> tho' they have no Foundation in the Word of God to &s;upport them; but are the Effect of their own over-heated Imaginations, and vain Conceit of their &s;uperiour
<PB N="4" REF="005667_0003_1026B9B1DD844A28">Attainments in Knowledge and Experience of the Spirit's Operation. And this &s;elf exalting Opinion leads Men to cen&s;ure and condemn tho&s;e as carnal and unconverted, who don't gratify their Ambition, and give them the Pre eminence above all that are not in their Way of thinking, how|ever otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Station, Piety and Accompli&s;hments. How applicable to &s;uch Men is the Parable, which our Saviour &s;pake <HI>concerning tho&s;e who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were Righteous, and de&s;pis'd others?</HI></P>
<P>And how lamentable are the Wounds and bitter Effects which this Spirit has already produc'd among Us! And what a formidable Appearance of &s;till greater Mi&s;ery! Whil&s;t Party is engag'd again&s;t Party, Mini&s;ters again&s;t Mini&s;ters, Churches again&s;t Churches; open Violations of &s;olemn Church-Covenants are become common, and , with &s;ome, commendable; Church-Members cen&s;uring, judging and walking with Slanders again&s;t one another; Party Councils are call'd to oppo&s;e each other, according to the different Denominations and Sentiments of the Parties inviting them: There have been &s;ome In&s;tances in the&s;e Times of Husbands who have for&s;aken their own lawful Wives, with whom they have liv'd in Love and Peace, alledging that &s;uch indeed are their carnal Wives, but as they think them unconverted, they reject them, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be warrantable and expedient to frequent the Company of other Women of the like pretended extraordinary Illumination.</P>
<P>Thus Communion of Churches is in a great degree lo&s;t, the beautiful Harmony of Mini&s;ters, as Fellow-helpers in their Work, turn'd too much into party Views and Strangene&s;s one towards another; the religious Order of Families turn'd out of Doors, the Honour and Duty of Children to Parents, Servants to Ma&s;ters is neglected, and Reverence due to the Aged and Honourable is ca&s;t behind our Backs. <HI>For the&s;e Things fearful|ne&s;s and trembling is come upon us; the Ways of Zion do mourn, her Prie&s;ts &s;igh, her Virgins are afflicted and &s;he is in bitterne&s;s, for her Beauty is de|parted, and Shame hath covered her Face.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis ea&s;y to point out the Troublers of our Peace and former happy Union. Every Man that will judge impartially and free from de&s;ign, knows that the Rev. Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>Whitefield, Tennant, Davenport,</HI> and other Itinerants, with the many Exhorters under their Influence, have thrown us into this Convul&s;ion and heat of Contention. Which plainly appears, in the fir&s;t Place, from Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this Gentleman mounted the Stage here, he liberally threw out his Cen&s;ures upon the Mini&s;ters, Colleges and Churches. The gene|rality <HI>of the Mini&s;ters preaching an unknown, unfelt Chri&s;t; that they were dead Men, which was the Rea&s;on of the deadne&s;s of their Congregations in
<PB N="5" REF="005667_0004_1026B9B460078620">Matters of Religion.</HI> vid. <HI>N. E.</HI> Journ. p. 70, 71. Thus a&s;&s;uming to him|&s;elf GOD's Prerogative, who claims it as his peculiar to know the Heart. The Di&s;ciples of CHRIST, tho' conver&s;ant with <HI>Judas</HI> the whole Term of our Saviour's publick Mini&s;try on Earth, did not know <HI>Judas</HI> to be an un|converted Man and a Traytor, 'till he di&s;covered it; but were all ready to &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves rather than him: They received <HI>Simon Magus</HI> into their Number as a true Believer, till he offer'd Money to purcha&s;e the Gifts of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Now can it be &s;uppos'd on any rational Grounds that Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or any others of like Pretences at this Day, are en|dowed with greater Gifts of the Spirit, &s;o as to be able to know what others feel of the Spirit of <HI>CHRIST</HI> in their Souls, and venture to publi&s;h it to the World, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has done? This is the Man that brought this Spirit of pretended Penetration into this Land. And with what an amazing Spread has it gained Pro&s;elytes in every Quarter? Some of whom pretend to determine the State of every Per&s;on they meet at fir&s;t Sight: Others more cautious judge by comparing Experiences, &s;till making their own Experiences the Standard by which others mu&s;t be tried. This Officiou&s;ne&s;s of Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> we have paid dear for, but what it may yet co&s;t us none can fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>What can we think this Gentleman means? Would he have us be|lieve that in this he acted the Part of a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, or a Chri&s;tian? Was it from the Dictates and Direction of the Spirit of GOD he &s;pake thus? <HI>That</HI> could not be, for the Spirit of Truth can't contradict it &s;elf; and the Spirit expre&s;ly tells us that <HI>him that &s;oweth Di&s;cord among Brethren, God hates,</HI> Prov. 6.19. And we are &s;trictly forbidden <HI>to receive an Accu&s;ation, again&s;t an Elder, but before two or three Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> 1 Tim 5.19. If we are <HI>not to take up</HI> an Accu&s;ation again&s;t a Mini&s;ter, but with a Provi&s;o, much le&s;s may we <HI>publi&s;h</HI> it. Was it po&s;&s;ible for Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> to produce authentick Vouchers to &s;upport his Charges again&s;t our Mini&s;ters, Colleges and Churches? No, verily. Nay, if all the invidious and di&s;affected Per|&s;ons in the Land, had come from all Parts with their united Complaints again&s;t their Mini&s;ters, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible for him (a perfect Stranger in the Country, and but a little while with us) to form an adequate Judge|ment on the State of Per&s;ons and Things, &s;o as to ju&s;tify the Accu&s;ations he has brought again&s;t them. Will Scripture, Rea&s;on or civil Ju&s;tice countenance &s;uch Conduct in <HI>any Man</HI> however otherwi&s;e fam'd? Does not this Gentleman arrogate to him&s;elf a &s;uper-intendancy, the Authority of Dictator-general, and a Power &s;o ab&s;olute that <HI>whom he will be &s;ets up, and whom he will be pulls down.</HI> What an unbecoming Slight does he
<PB N="6" REF="005667_0005_1026B9B5E88FC618">put on the Mini&s;ters in general, however de&s;erving, except &s;ome few who are in a &s;ort canonized in his Journal? But his Authority in this and his Itinerancy (as by him manag'd) we deny, becau&s;e not commanded: For what is not appointed in the Word of GOD, in Matter, of Religion and Order, is a Degree of Idolatry, and forbidden in the &s;econd Com|mandment.</P>
<P>Did Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> intend thus to <HI>&s;mite the Shepherds, that the Sheep might be &s;cattered?</HI> If &s;o, he may behold with Satisfaction (if any can be had in it) that his De&s;igns are wonderfully &s;ucceeded in the pre&s;ent &s;cattered State of our Churches, from the Prejudices which he has in&s;tilled into the Minds of many again&s;t their own Pa&s;tors and Brethren.</P>
<P>Moreover, This Gentleman's Conduct is the more exceptionable, for that many of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters whom he has &s;o liberally loaded with Infamy and Contempt, are Gentlemen who&s;e Characters have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Con&s;ciences of all that knew them, for their Soundne&s;s in the Faith, and good Example of Life, and that for more Years than he has liv'd in the World, their Enemies them&s;elves being Judges, 'till he had prejudic'd their Minds by his evil In&s;inuations. Yet the&s;e good Men are now loaded with manifold Calumny, under which they go heavily and hardly be&s;tead, in an advanced Age, <HI>becau&s;e Reproach has broken their Bones;</HI> the Re|proaches not of Strangers only, but their Brethren in the Mini&s;try, and in their Communion al&s;o: And now they have but little pro&s;pect of healing, and expect to live in a great Mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s, and then go to their Graves with the bleeding Wounds of this Gentleman's cen&s;orious Pen, and the Reproaches of Exhorters and others which have fallen upon them.</P>
<P>What an a&s;&s;uming Temper does Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> al&s;o &s;hew in condemning our College? vid. Journ. p. 96. When he &s;ays, <HI>"their Light is become Darkne&s;s, Darkne&s;s that may be felt."</HI> This is a &s;ad Reproach upon a Society which GOD has remarkably &s;mil'd on, and made a rich Ble&s;&s;ing; from whence has i&s;&s;ued a Succe&s;&s;ion of able and faithful Mini&s;ters, for the Sup|ply of the&s;e Churches for a Century of Years, without Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But we tru&s;t GOD will appear in the Behalf of our Colleges, and wipe off the A&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon them, and &s;till continue them rich Seminaries of Piety and Learning. What can be the De&s;ign of this Gentleman in publi&s;hing &s;uch Repre&s;entations of our Colleges, unle&s;s it be to induce us to content our&s;elves with illiterate and enthu&s;ia&s;tick Exhor|ters, whom he or his Friends have &s;et up, 'till we can be &s;upplied from <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, the Orphan-Hou&s;e in Georgia,</HI> or <HI>the Shepherd's Tent?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005667_0006_1026B9B7B75B91E0">
But as pre&s;&s;ing Repre&s;entations and ju&s;t Complaints have been publi&s;hed on the&s;e Heads, by the Governours of our Colleges, united A&s;&s;ociations of Mini&s;ters, and &s;everal of our Rev. and aged Fathers &s;eparately: I &s;hall only Remark at pre&s;ent, that it is the Opinion of many, that &s;ince Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> has not manife&s;ted his Repentance for the Offences he &s;tands charged with, tho' call'd to it from all Quarters, he therefore &s;tands indited, <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ro Eccle&s;iae,</HI> and in the Memory and ju&s;t Re&s;entment of all that act up to the Rules of Go&s;pel-Di&s;cipline, for ra&s;h Judging and Slander. They think he has been guilty of a Breach of the ninth Commandment, or in other Words, <HI>has born fal&s;e Witne&s;s</HI> (as is &s;ometimes &s;aid) <HI>with a witne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And then as tho' Mr. <HI>W.</HI> had not &s;ufficiently broken our Churches, we were &s;oon vi&s;ited by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent;</HI> who was &s;ent by him, and redoubled his A&s;per&s;ions on the Mini&s;try; yet not with &s;o much Opene&s;s in the&s;e Parts, as he has done in his <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, wherein he declares <HI>the Body of the Clergy of this Generation to be un|converted.</HI> And that he might the more effectually promote Divi&s;ions among us, did, in his publick Exerci&s;es at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> thank GOD for the Divi&s;ions which began to appear there, and pray'd they might be increas'd as an hopeful Omen of an happy Reformation. As if the People were <HI>Barbarians</HI> or <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and needed now by him to be taught the fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of GOD. That he was of &s;uch a divi&s;ive Tem|per, his Sermon on unconverted Mini&s;ters is a &s;ufficient Proof. His Words are the&s;e, <HI>Pag.</HI> 12, 13, <Q>GOD's People have a Right to all GOD's Mini&s;ters; why mayn't they u&s;e them as they have Opportu|nity? And if they &s;hould go a few Miles further than ordinary to enjoy tho&s;e they Profit mo&s;t by, whom do they wrong?</Q> This was a Le&s;&s;on of Indulgence &s;o plea&s;ing to the Di&s;affected, that they &s;oon put it in Practice, and thereupon &s;eparated them&s;elves from their Pa&s;tors and Brethren in greater Numbers than before, per&s;i&s;ting in it as laudable and a Duty from this Act of Toleration and Advice.</P>
<P>He then draws a Compari&s;on from the le&s;s to the greater, <HI>viz.</HI> From the irrational Creatures, the Bea&s;ts, Birds and Fi&s;hes, which are led by an in&s;tinct in Nature, to &s;eek the Food which they like be&s;t&punc; A weak Way of arguing indeed! (however plau&s;ible it may appear to &s;ome) to make Men as di&s;orderly and voracious as the wild Bea&s;ts of the Earth and Fi&s;hes of the Sea, who bite and prey upon one another. This indeed is too much our Manner at pre&s;ent, and is encouraged by many who take Sanctuary under the Sentiments of tho&s;e Gentlemen I have mention'd and others of the like divi&s;ive Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005667_0007_1026B9BAC593B048">
The Rev Mr. <HI>James Davenport,</HI> in Succe&s;&s;ion, made a Vi&s;it al&s;o to the&s;e Parts of the Country, deem'd to be a Man full of the Spirit, as indeed he was of the like cen&s;orious, judging and uncharitable Spirit: But he did not care to take Things meerly upon tru&s;t and evil Su&s;picion, as others had done before him; and therefore proceeded to a formal Examination into the Experiences of Mini&s;ters, in order to form a right Judgment of their State, and whether they preach'd an unknown unfelt CHRIST, or not. But becau&s;e of this and other &s;uch like Steps, and being apprehended to be under a deep Tincture of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, he had not Admi&s;&s;ion into the Gentlemen's Pulpits at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which 'tis probable he and others expected. And 'tis thought by many that if there had been the like Caution with Re&s;pect to the former Gentlemen, the Pro&s;pect of Peace in our Churches would have been more hopeful than now it is like to be. When Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> fir&s;t came among us the Expectations of many were rais'd to an high Degree; but by rea&s;on of his enthu&s;ia&s;tick Conduct here, and his burning the Books at <HI>New-London,</HI> and his partial Retractations, mo&s;t of his Admirers have chang'd their Minds, and call him delirious, or an Apo&s;tate, or both.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Gentlemen had &s;upported their Conduct by divine Revelation, it would not have been wonder'd at, that they had &s;o many Admirers: But as they bring no &s;tronger Te&s;timony than their own bare Word, and the Mea&s;ures which they have taken are &s;o contrary to the known Rules of the Go&s;pel,&mdash;we &s;ay, &mdash; <HI>Let God be true, but every Man a Liar. To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI></P>
<P>But as the&s;e two Gentlemen Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>Tennent</HI> and <HI>Davenport</HI> have pub|li&s;hed &s;ome Retractations on the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall leave them at pre&s;ent, more &s;eriou&s;ly and penitently to reflect on the Hurt they have done to Religion, the Mini&s;try and the Order of our Churches, wi&s;hing that they and all other Itinerants and publick Exhorters which they have dextrou&s;ly promoted may be prevailed with to be equally &s;ollicitous, to re&s;tore our Peace as they have been in&s;trumental to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o had the the Rev. Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>Cro&s;swell, Wheelock, Par&s;ons, Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, Moorehead,</HI> &amp;c. in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Excur&s;ions, not as Healers of our Hurt, but Augmentors of Strife in our Societies.</P>
<P>To return to Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI> He is now making a &s;econd Vi&s;it to us, in pompous Progre&s;s from Town to Town follow'd with the loud Accla|mations of many People, while &s;ome, from whom more manly Things
<PB N="9" REF="005667_0008_1026B9BF1CD79B20">might be expected, &s;eem to lay their Necks at his Feet to trample on at Plea&s;ure, as if his Word was not only <HI>his own</HI> but <HI>their</HI> Law al&s;o,&mdash;accor|ding to that&mdash;<HI>Stat pro ratione Voluntas.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e this Gentleman would be thought to act in the Capacity of an <HI>Evangeli&s;t;</HI> but I think his Methods no ways an&s;wer this Character; for according to the generally receiv'd Notion, he mu&s;t then Preach chiefly where Mini&s;ters are not &s;ettled, and the pure Go&s;pel and the Ordinances thereof e&s;tabli&s;h'd, which is the unhappy Ca&s;e of &s;ome Towns in this and the neighbouring Government: Whereas he &s;huns the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Writing of this Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has taken a Tour into &s;ome of the Towns which are without &s;ettled Mini&s;ters, and the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel.</NOTE>, and preaches chiefly in our great Towns where there are &s;ettled Mini&s;ters, as able and perhaps more &s;o than him&s;elf; and &s;o in&s;tead of healing our Divi&s;ions, in|crea&s;es them, as is the evident Effect in mo&s;t of the Towns where he has preach'd both now and when he was here before.&mdash;What Con&s;tructions can be put on the&s;e Things, but either that he acts too much on Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> The more we are divided, &s;o much the more hopeful Pro|&s;pect of the revival of Religion; or el&s;e that he retains his declar'd Opini|on of the Mini&s;ters in general, that they are dead Men, &amp;c. &mdash;And agree|ing with Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> that it is as dangerous to the Souls of Men to hear &s;uch Mini&s;ters preach as a Potion of Ratsbane would be to their Bodies; perhaps Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> tarries among us to deliver our People from this mortal Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the De&s;igns of this Gentlemen, I think the melan|choly Condition of our Churches calls upon all <HI>that love Zion and pray for her Peace and Pro&s;perity, to con&s;ider, take Advice, and &s;peak their Minds.</HI> I am thus free to offer my Opinion, under affecting Apprehen&s;ions of the Evils come and coming on our Con&s;titution. And as I have no De&s;ign to offend any Per&s;on, but only de&s;ire that Things may be <HI>weigh'd in the Bal|lance of the Sanctuary,</HI> and that our lo&s;t Love and Unity and Order may be re&s;tor'd, therefore crave Leave, to offer the following Queries to the Publick, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e Reverend Mini&s;ters who have given Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;uch free Admi&s;&s;ion into their Pulpits.</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 1. Whether there is not at lea&s;t an Appearance of Incon&s;i&s;tency in tho&s;e Gentlemen's Conduct who had &s;ub&s;crib'd in their publick Te&s;timo|ny again&s;t Itinerant Preachers? Unle&s;s the Provi&s;o of <HI>Sub&s;tance, Scope and End,</HI> annex'd to &s;ome of their Names was de&s;ign'd to pre&s;erve a Liberty in that Ca&s;e to act as Occa&s;ion might call for: Or mu&s;t the Sub&s;cription be
<PB N="10" REF="005667_0009_1026B9C0A488B4F8">under&s;tood to mean all Itinerant Preachers <HI>except</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield?</HI> Or was in then thought that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> would not come among us again? Or mu&s;t we &s;ay that it is allowable after Vows to make Enquiry?&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 2. Whether the&s;e Gentlemen have exerci&s;ed due Love and af|fectionate Regard to their Brethren in the Mini&s;try, in inviting Mr <HI>White|field</HI> to preach when they might at the fir&s;t Glance fore&s;ee, that it had a direct Tendency to revive Su&s;picions in the Minds of their di&s;affected Bre|thren, and to open the Wound which was then under hopeful Symptoms of Healing?&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 3. Whether the&s;e Gentlemen have di&s;cover'd a ju&s;t Regard to our Colleges, which have &s;o long been the Glory and Strength of our Ci|vil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity? Have they been fir'd with a becoming Re|&s;entment at the&s;e A&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon the&s;e Societies, by that Gentleman whom they &s;o much care&s;s? Where is the Honour and Gratitude due to their venerable Mother in who&s;e Bo&s;om, the&s;e very Gentlemen have been nouri&s;hed and tenderly brought up, and to whom under GOD they owe their Academical Acquirements and publick u&s;eful Improvements?</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 4.

<P>&mdash;But to return,&mdash;</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had, at this his &s;econd coming, &s;een Cau&s;e publickly to declare, that on better Light receiv'd he thought proper to recede from his &s;olemn Oaths and Sub&s;criptions to practice according to the Rites and Forms of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and had al&s;o evidenc'd his &s;incere Repentance by retracting his ra&s;h and groundle&s;s Charges thrown on the Mini&s;try in general, Colleges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; And had at the &s;ame Time us'd his Endeavours to &s;weeten the Tempers of tho&s;e whom he had di&s;affected to|wards their Pa&s;tors and Brethren, and to recover from their un&s;criptural Separations, and to return them to their Duty, as one under &s;uperiour Advantages for that Purpo&s;e above all Mankind, con&s;idering his Influence on them; and had he likewi&s;e put him&s;elf under the Quality of a Candi|date for the Mini&s;try in order to a &s;ettled Improvement in any of the&s;e Churches, or el&s;e had better an&s;wer'd the Character of an <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> by preaching in un go&s;peliz'd Places: I &s;ay had he done thus, then his Con|duct in general would not have lain open to the &s;ame Cen&s;ure in the&s;e Churches as now it does. But it is the Opinion of many (and as they think founded on Scripture and Rea&s;on) that unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had come into &s;uch Steps as the&s;e, he ought not to have Admi&s;&s;ion, much le&s;s Invitation, to any Gentleman's Desk in the Country, but to be rejected as a <HI>di&s;orderly walker.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o Matter of Grief and Surprize to many in the Country to hear that a Reverend Father, (who&s;e Prai&s;e has been in all the&s;e Churches, and who&s;e Character has been bright in this and remote Countries) &s;hould now be the fir&s;t of his Order in the&s;e Parts, to introduce Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to preach in his Pulpit, and to admini&s;ter the Sacrament of the LORD'S-Supper in his Church: But 'tis hop'd that for the future, this In&s;tance will be improv'd as a Caution rather than an Encouragement to others, in this Day of mighty Expectation, when Example goes beyond Precept. How|ever, Honour and Re&s;pect command us to form a Con&s;truction in this Ca&s;e according to con&s;tant Experience; <HI>viz. That the mo&s;t pious, wi&s;e and &s;ingularly accompli&s;h'd Men are but Men, and evidence them&s;elves &s;uch in more or le&s;s obvious In&s;tances.</HI> Many are as much and &s;ome more &s;tumbled at Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct in this Matter, and think him chargeable with Arrogance and U&s;urpation as well Breach of &s;olemn Vows and Promi&s;es. Let that be as it will. &mdash; It was certainly a very &s;trange thing
<PB N="14" REF="005667_0013_1026B9CB72B4AEB0">that a Gentleman under his Circum&s;tances, and doubtle&s;s acquainted with the Order of the&s;e Churches, &s;hould make &s;uch a Pu&s;h at our Con&s;titution, unle&s;s it was with a De&s;ign to overthrow it, and with this View, &mdash; The &s;ooner the better.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to enquire here, whether the Brethren of that Communi|on were led into this &s;tep of Innovation, as free Agents, or thro' &s;urprize? We charitably hope they have &s;een their Error and are feelingly qualifyed to become Monitors to them&s;elves and others for the future.</P>
<P>Who can Account for the like Mea&s;ures come into, in &s;ome other Churches? Unle&s;s the high E&s;teem of this Gentleman has led them &s;uper|&s;titiou&s;ly to imagine, that the Elements in that Holy Ordinance are &s;o much the more &s;acred and efficacious, when receiv'd from his Hands. Have they forgotten their Catechi&s;m which tells them, that <HI>The Sacraments be|come effectual Means of Salvation, not from any Virtue in them, or in him that doth admini&s;ter them; but only be the Ble&s;&s;ing of CHRIST, and the working of his SPIRIT in them, that by Faith receive them.</HI></P>
<P>What a criminal &s;ilence would it be, after all the formentioned Evils which are come upon us, <HI>when our Breach is great as the Sea,</HI> if the Mi|ni&s;ters of CHRIST (who are <HI>&s;it as Watchmen on the Walls of Jeru&s;alem</HI>) don't open their Mouths like a Trumpet and warn the People whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.

<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible for our <HI>venerable Fathers,</HI> who&s;e renown'd Heads are laid in the Du&s;t, to behold &s;uch Multitudes, and perhaps not a few of their own dear Offspring, following and applauding enthu&s;ia&s;tick Strangers and ignorant Exhorters, whil&s;t their dear and beloved Brethren &s;tand neglect|ed and de&s;pi&s;ed, wounded not only by Enemies, but in the Hou&s;e and by the Hands of their Friends, as not worthy to be compar'd with tho&s;e of the new make; (I &s;ay could our Fathers &s;ee this) with what Indignation would they reprove the early Apo&s;tacy of their Children, who are turned out of the Way &s;o quickly after their Fathers have fallen a&s;leep? As a Confirmation of this we may con&s;ult many of the Di&s;cour&s;es of the&s;e excellent Worthies, wherein they gave their dying Te&s;timonies to the Order of the&s;e Churches, and charge their Po&s;terity to endeavour to pre&s;erve it.</P>

Nay even a Stranger that had been kindly receiv'd, and liv'd and died among us in the Work of the Mini&s;try, has left us the&s;e Words as his dying Advice. <Q>It was one of the Glories of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they had &s;hewn &s;o much Re&s;pect to Mini&s;ters educated abroad;</Q> but then re|flecting on &s;ome late Occurences, he added,&mdash;<Q>That for the future it was advi&s;eable for us to make a more due Enquiry into the Principles of Strangers that come among us, le&s;t in&s;tead of moderate Presbyterians, which the Churches honour &amp; embrace without any di&s;agreement or diffi|culty; they &s;hould commit them&s;elves into the Hands of <HI>ra&s;h Incendiaries.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole. If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Mea&s;ures have the mo&s;t direct Tendency to &s;trengthen the Di&s;cipline of the&s;e Churches, to promote Love and good Agreement among Mini&s;ters and Brethren, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Reputation of our Colleges, and are the only hopeful Means to bring about a thorough Reformation,&mdash;Then let this Gentleman and his Friends rejoice in the Fire which he has kindled, tho' it has already burnt many ex|cellent <HI>Cedars in</HI> our <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and yet continues to flame in the&s;e Churches with Rage and Violence: But if not,&mdash;Then let us all come to a &s;tand and con&s;ider, whether the Good &s;uppos'd to be done in &s;ome Places, <HI>can coun|tervail the King's Damage, who is the Head of his Church, and the Glory of it where he walks.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to proceed in the next Place,</P>
<P>To offer &s;ome <HI>Healing Mea&s;ures</HI> in order to recover us out of our broken State, and to re&s;tore Peace and Love.</P>
<P>They will greatly mi&s;take my De&s;ign, who &s;uppo&s;e it to be any other than this, in all that I have offer'd in the former Part of my Letter. It exceedingly grieves me for the Occa&s;ion of it, and I hope it may affect the Hearts of &s;ome in <HI>reading,</HI> as it does mine in <HI>writing.</HI></P>
<P>We find by &s;orrowful Experience that wi&s;e and good Men have fallen into very different Ways of thinking, &s;peaking and acting in Matters of Religion. In pur&s;uing my Purpo&s;e therefore it may be proper to enquire into the Grounds of our pre&s;ent Difference. If I have a true Idea of Things, our pre&s;ent Controver&s;y is not about the fundamental Points of Religion. All agree in the Doctrine of Original Sin, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion or the New-Birth, of Ju&s;tification by Faith in the Merits of CHRIST&punc; the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteou&s;ne&s;s received by Faith, and good Works or an holy Obedience as a Fruit and Evidence of true Faith. All my Brethren in the Mini&s;try, that I am acquainted with, a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e Doctrines, and preach them to their Hearers. They can't there|fore
<PB N="16" REF="005667_0015_1026B9D0E0FC84E0">on this Account with any Propriety be term'd Oppo&s;ers of the Work of GOD. Moreover, if at any Time it has been prov'd again&s;t any Mini|ni&s;ter, that his Doctrine or Life is not according to the Go&s;pel, he has by our Con&s;titution been removed from his Mini&s;try. For what is it then that &s;o many of the well-principl'd Servants of CHRIST are at this Day call'd Oppo&s;ers of the Work of GOD? Certainly they have not de&s;erv'd this odious Character: And it will appear unrea&s;onable that their &s;eparating Brethren have branded them with this Name, if we con&s;ider, What it is they oppo&s;e&punc;</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, they oppo&s;e the &s;o much applauded Method of Itine|rant Preaching; becau&s;e they don't know of any Scripture Warrant to &s;upport it: Nor can the Itinerants prove their Mi&s;&s;ion by their miraculous Healing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Evangeli&s;ts of old did,&mdash;and it breaks in upon Order which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of Religion: For tho' &s;ome|times there may be external Order without true Religion, yet true Reli|gion can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in a Country without Order.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>They oppo&s;e publick Exhorters; becau&s;e they are neither that Order of Men to whom CHRIST has promi&s;ed his Pre&s;ence to the End of the World, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. <HI>ult.</HI> Nor are they of the Number of the <HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets, Evangeli&s;ts, Pa&s;ors or Teachers, which Chri&s;t has given for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying the Body of Chri&s;t,</HI> Eph. 4 11. Nor are they of the Elder&s;hip &s;poken of, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. Nor tho&s;e mentioned, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. They are therefore to be oppo&s;ed as a &s;purious Offspring, not legitimated in Scripture, but of the Number of fal&s;e Teachers whom the Apo&s;tle mentions, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.17. which &s;eems to be exemplified in the Itinerants and publick Exhorters of this Day, <HI>They zealou&s;ly affect you, but not well; yea they would exclude us</HI> (as 'tis render'd in the Margin the true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t) <HI>that you may affect them</HI> In|a&s;much therefore as the&s;e Men take this Honour to them&s;elves, when they are neither called of GOD, nor can they produce any Te&s;timony or Example from Scripture to &s;upport their Pretences, Duty and Intere&s;t calls upon both Mini&s;ters and Churches to oppo&s;e them, and the Errors and Di&s;orders they have introduced. It is good to be zealou&s;ly affected in a good Thing, for which &s;ome are to be commended at this Day: But when Zeal for Reformation is beclouded with uncharitable Judgings of Fellow-Chri&s;tians, it is not according to Knowledge, and therefore &s;hould be watch'd with Caution. One &s;ays, <Q>Take heed that when Zeal for Refor|mation knocks at the Door, &s;ome new Error &s;teps not in with it, which will as much need an after-Reformation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005667_0016_1026B9D42C9E4D60">
Moreover, They oppo&s;e (not the regular Conduct of tho&s;e who have appear'd to be wrought on in a genuine evangelical Manner, but) that unlimited Liberty which many have given them&s;elves, to judge and con|demn the State of others; even tho&s;e who are of known Orthodox Prin|ciples and unblemi&s;hed Lives. This is not warranted, but &s;trictly forbid|den in Scripture, as might be abundantly prov'd.</P>
<P>They oppo&s;e Dreams, Vi&s;ions, Revelations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and bodily Appearances of CHRIST to the natural Sight of the Eye, which many have lately pre|tended to: As tho' the holy Scriptures were not a compleat Sy&s;tem of Divine Revelation, and &s;ufficient Rule of Life, but that we &s;till &s;tood in need of &s;omething farther to direct us in point of our Faith and Practice: Which mu&s;t be denied, and con&s;equently oppo&s;ed, as that which leads into manifold dangerous Errors and Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Out-cries and bodily Agitations in Time of divine Wor&s;hip, &s;o common in A&s;&s;emblies, and applauded by many as Signs of the Spirit's powerful Operation, is objected again&s;t, as no ways profitable to Souls, but an hindrance of the true Ends of Wor&s;hip. Preaching is a rational as well as a religious Act, both in the Preacher and Hearer of the Word; but the&s;e Out-cries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> de&s;troy both. It would be &s;trange to conceive, that there were cryings-out in the Congregation when <HI>Samuel</HI> rea&s;oned with the People to convince them of their Sin, in asking a King; and what can he mean when he &s;aith, <HI>Now therefore &s;tand &s;till that I may rea&s;on with you before the Lord,&mdash;1 Sam.</HI> 12.7. But that they &s;hould give their united Attention to his Rea&s;onings with them? Or how was it po&s;&s;ible their Rea&s;on &s;hould be duely exerci&s;ed, or the true Ends of his Preaching an&s;wered, which as I &s;aid was for their Conviction? And it prov'd effectual as we may &s;ee in the following part of the Chapter; and why did it &s;o? becau&s;e they &s;tood &s;till, i. e. they were not noi&s;y and tumultuous.&mdash;The like In&s;tance we have in <HI>Paul,</HI> when he rea&s;oned of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Tem|perance, and Judgment to come,</HI> Acts 24.25. it is &s;aid, <HI>Felix trembled.</HI> He rea&s;oned,&mdash;but what Effect could his Rea&s;oning have had on <HI>Felix</HI> if it were ob&s;tructed by Out cries? Or on <HI>Agrippa,</HI> when he was <HI>almo&s;t per|&s;uaded to be a Chri&s;tian,</HI> Acts 26.28.</P>
<P>Furthermore, That quick and in&s;tantaneous A&s;&s;urance many now boa&s;t of, is ju&s;tly objected again&s;t. As they pretend, it follows immedi|ately upon their recovery out of &s;trong Convictions for Sin, and when the Mind is calm'd, and Terrors of the Law worn off, they pre&s;ently arrive at A&s;&s;urance, which is dangerous to the Souls of Men; for &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance Hypocrites them&s;elves re&s;t upon. That A&s;&s;urance, in its true meaning, is attainable in this Life, none of the Orthodox deny; but hold
<PB N="18" REF="005667_0017_1026B9D6E8857D48">that according to the ordinary Method of Grace, GOD leads true Believers to re&s;t in a well-grounded &s;criptural Hope of Ju&s;tification thro' the Merits of CHRIST, evidenc'd by the Mortification of Sin in them, and lively Actings of Grace, in a Life of &s;weet and holy Communion with GOD: Such an A&s;&s;urance is to be depended upon; and not &s;uch an one as ri&s;es like a Mu&s;hroom, or as <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, that grows in a Night and peri&s;hes as in a Night.</P>
<P>That prevailing Opinion al&s;o, That all true Converts mu&s;t know the Time and Circum&s;tances of their Conver&s;ion, is ju&s;tly to be objected to; for as CHRIST is Lord of his own Grace, he be&s;tows when, to whom, in what Manner and Mea&s;ure he plea&s;es. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was &s;anctified in the Womb; and <HI>Samuel</HI> we may conceive was &s;anctified then, or &s;oon after in his Childhood: <HI>Timothy</HI> knew the Scriptures from a Child. Some GOD reveals him&s;elf to in a gradual Way, under the Means of Grace and the Spirit's Operation, that are made effectual by his Ble&s;&s;ing for their Conver|&s;ion; and others in a more apparent, &s;en&s;ible Manner, as he did to <HI>Paul:</HI> Which different Method of Grace CHRIST &s;hews by the Compari&s;on he u&s;es, <HI>John</HI> 3.8. CHRIST as much prov'd the Sovereignty of his Grace in opening the Eyes of the blind Man by weak and gradual Means, <HI>John</HI> 9.6.7. as he did by un&s;toping the deaf Man's Ears with a Word &s;peaking <HI>Mark</HI> 7.34.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing I &s;hall offer here by way of Objection in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, is that prevailing Practice of having &s;ome Mini&s;ters Per&s;ons in &s;uch high Admiration, as in a &s;ort to Deify them. GOD has given different Gifts to Mini&s;ters as well as others; and as tho&s;e of &s;uperiour Qualifications are not to be overvalued, neither &s;hould tho&s;e of lower Gifts and Attain|ments be de&s;pi&s;ed: In the&s;e Ca&s;es its often that People are acted more by Fancy than Judgment, which &s;eems too much our pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. This was what the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> faulted the Churches of <HI>Corinth</HI> for, as they li&s;ted them&s;elves, &s;ome under one Mini&s;ter, and &s;ome under another, and tells them they were carnal and walk'd as Men, not as Chri&s;tians, and he gives the Rea&s;ons, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3, 4. This too high E&s;teem of one Mini&s;ter, and too low E&s;timation of another, led them into Envying, Strife, and Divi&s;i|ons, as the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Conduct&punc; He had before re|proved this Practice of theirs, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 11, 12, 13. And complains of their Contentions, <HI>One &s;aith, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>another I am of</HI> Apollos, <HI>ano|ther I am of</HI> Cephas, <HI>or</HI> Peter, <HI>another I am of</HI> Chri&s;t. Then <HI>v.</HI> 13. he proceeds farther to detect this Corruption by <HI>&s;aying, is Chri&s;t divided? was</HI> Paul <HI>crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the Name of</HI> Paul? Now as this Ca&s;e is become &s;o remarkably ours at this Day, I &s;uppo&s;e it not ami&s;s to glo&s;s a little on the Text above cited and &s;ay.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="19" REF="005667_0018_1026B9D882B20C58">
1. That nothing (ordinarily) has a more direct Tendency to break the Peace of fellow-Chri&s;tians and Churches, and throw them into Envyings, Strife, Divi&s;ions and Contentions, than when they fall into Parties, from a different and too high e&s;teem of one Mini&s;ter above all others.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Mini&s;ters of CHRIST will aim more at the Glory of GOD the Peace, Unity and good Order of his Church and Churches, than at the highe&s;t popular Applau&s;e and parti&s;an Acclamations of Prai&s;e. This we find in <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' fir&s;t in order, and perhaps the Number of his Ad|mirers and Followers exceeded the re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters, yet, his faithful|ne&s;s to CHRIST, and his Zeal to re&s;tore Peace in this Church, led him in &s;o &s;harp a Manner to reprove their Sin and &s;eparating Di&s;po&s;itions. Which is left as an Example for all CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, and for the warn|ing and In&s;truction of his Churches and People in every after-Age and Generation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Thing I &s;hall note from the Apo&s;tle's Words above, is, that when Churches, or the profe&s;&s;ed Followers of JESUS CHRIST fall in|to Parties from their different E&s;teem of Mini&s;ters, it is then mo&s;t probable CHRIST will have the &s;malle&s;t Numbers of &s;incere Followers on his Side&mdash;For we find &s;ome were for <HI>Paul</HI> others for <HI>Apollos,</HI> others were for <HI>Cephas,</HI> here were three Parts of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> &s;ome for one, and others for another Mini&s;ter, CHRIST could therefore have but a very &s;mall Part among them: It is therefore ob&s;ervable, he &s;aith, is CHRIST divided, or do you expect to find CHTIST dividing him&s;elf into the&s;e Mini&s;ters; and to prove the contrary, he &s;aith, was <HI>Paul,</HI> or any of the&s;e Mini&s;ters you &s;o much admire, crucified for you? Or were you baptized in his or any other of their Names? As the Words and Sen&s;e of the Thing Import.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much then as the&s;e &s;everal Heads of Particulars, mentioned above, are what make and foment our Divi&s;ions, and are not &s;upported either by Scripture or Rea&s;on, Can the Conduct of tho&s;e be ju&s;tified who brand the Characters of their Pa&s;tors and Brethren as Oppo&s;ers of the Work of GOD, and under that received Notion, unwarrantably &s;eparate from them?&mdash;It was with great Satisfaction indeed, that the pious and well-meaning People in general, in the &s;everal Governments here, at fir&s;t receiv'd the Tydings of tho&s;e remarkable Awakenings that many, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the younger Sort, &s;eem'd to be brought under; and it is Matter of great Thankfulne&s;s to GOD, that their Hopes have been &s;o far an&s;wer'd, as that there are Evidences of &s;ome Per&s;ons who have been &s;avingly wrought on, and brought home to CHRIST in the&s;e Times of Commotion, in one Place and another, as in Charity we are oblig'd to believe: Yet nothing is more evident than that the State of Religion is in a more langui&s;hing Condition
<PB N="20" REF="005667_0019_1026B9DC324333E8">in our Churches in general, than ever before has been known in the Memory of Man. Where is the Reformation, &s;o much talk'd of, to be found, except in a few Places? Nor can it in Rea&s;on be &s;uppos'd that a noble Structure can be built without a &s;olid and proper Foundation; nor when the principal Artificers pull down with one Hand what they build up with the other; which appears too much our unhappine&s;s, and is Mat|ter of Lamentation, and &s;hall be for a Lamentation; and the more &s;o, if after all the Means of Conviction and Healing that can be offered, the Language and Re&s;olutions of the Times remain as of old, &s;aying, there <HI>is no hope, no, for we have cho&s;en Strangers, and after them we will go;</HI> which GOD forbid: For without a wonderful Interpo&s;ition of Providence to re&s;tore our lo&s;t and long bani&s;hed Peace, what can be expected, as an Event of the prevailing Contentions and Separations, but the utter Demolition of the&s;e Churches, and the Con&s;titution on which they are &s;o happily found|ed: The prudent Man fore&s;eeth the Evil and hideth him&s;elf; it highly behoves us to hide our &s;elves in this evil Day under the Covert of CHRIST'S Wing, and pray for that Wi&s;dom which is from above, and is profitable to direct us in this critical Juncture, to throw off the different Denomina|tions, and disband the contending Parties, Uniting in Love as CHRIST'S my&s;tical Body and Members in particular, and as &s;uch conforming our|&s;elves as much as in us lies to Go&s;pel Commands, which in no Part of it that (I know of) will ju&s;tify, but contrary-wi&s;e condemn our &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Heats and Animo&s;ities and Methods, in which they are carried on in the general, on the one &s;ide, and on the other. I therefore humbly recommend that Text of many others that might be offered, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>If there be therefore any Con&s;olation in Chri&s;t, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellow&s;hip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fullfil ye my Joy. &mdash; That ye be like-minded, having the &s;ame Love, being of one Accord, of one Mind; let no|thing be done through Strife, or vain Glory; but in lowline&s;s of Mind, let each E&s;teem other better than them&s;elves.</HI> Now then as the <HI>End of the Com|mandment is Charity,</HI> out of a pure Heart, &mdash; which we are commanded above all Things to put on, and as Chr&s;tians to arm our &s;elves with, as by it we are led to hope and believe the be&s;t Things one of another, and to cover a Multitude of Faults and Imperfections we &s;ee one in another; and as vital Piety and practical Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much in the right Exerci&s;e of this Grace of Charity, and by the want of it &s;o much the more in Proportion, will Contentions be &s;trengthned and abound among Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors, as our pre&s;ent and very &s;orrowful Experience does Evidence, let us all throw off an uncharitable cen&s;orious judging, divi&s;ive Di&s;po&s;ition, and be deeply humbled before GOD has who &s;uffered Satan that Accu&s;er of the Brethren to &s;ow the Seeds of Di&s;cord among us, and
<PB N="21" REF="005667_0020_1026B9DFB97D8F50">animated them, thro' his &s;ubtle In&s;inuations, to become Accu&s;ers one of another in this Day of Temptation, too much whereof is to be found on one Side, and the other.</P>
<P>It was once a wi&s;e and very &s;ea&s;onable Enquiry made by a Captain and Leader in <HI>I&s;rael, &mdash; Shall the Sword devour for ever?</HI> An Enquiry highly applicable, and with great Propriety to be impre&s;&s;ed on the Minds of all, in the&s;e Times, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that appear foremo&s;t in promoting the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y: Then it follows, <HI>Knowe&s;t thou not that it will be bitterne&s;s in the latter end?</HI> An Admonition, truly worthy to be writ in Capital Letters of the large&s;t Size, and fixt in all Places of publick Re&s;ort, that <HI>they who run may read and learn to leave off Contention, before it be further meddled with.</HI></P>
<P>As I am free from an Attachment to a Party, but if I know my own Heart &s;incerely de&s;irous, that <HI>that</HI> Peace and <HI>that</HI> Charity, without which our Religion is vain, and that Truth and Holine&s;s may be re&s;tored, &s;trength|ened, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and more and more abound among us, I &s;hall addre&s;s my Brethren, tho&s;e Churches, and my Country, in the Words of a late<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Flavel.</NOTE> excellent and approved Writer in a like Time of growing Di&s;|&s;ention. &mdash; <Q>For my own Part, It is my fixed Re&s;olution to provoke no good Man, if I can help it; but if their own inveterate Zeal &s;hall pro|voke them in pur&s;uit of their Errors or Mi&s;conduct, &mdash; I will ear|ne&s;tly contend in the Cau&s;e of Truth: &mdash; I have &s;incerely aimed at the Purity and Peace of the Church of GOD; and he greatly mi&s;takes that takes me for a Man of Contention, &mdash; But an hearty De&s;ire and &s;eri|ous Motion for Peace among all the profe&s;s'd Members of CHRIST.&mdash;Let all Letigations of this Nature (at lea&s;t in this critical Juncture) be &s;u&s;pended by common Con&s;ent, &s;ince they wa&s;te our Time, hinder our Communion, imbitter our Spirits, impoveri&s;h practical Godline&s;s, grieve the Spirit of GOD and good Men, make Sport for our common Enemies, who warm their own Fingers at the Fire of our Contentions, and place more Tru&s;t in our dividing Lu&s;ts, than they do in their own feeble Ar|guments.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>To conclude, My Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God, is, that all who love the&s;e Churches of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that pray for their Peace &amp; Pro&s;|perity, would labour to their utmo&s;t to allay Animo&s;ities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and eminently the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST thro' the Land; by their Doctrine, Example, and Influence, endeavouring to turn the Hearts of this People to CHRIST, and one towards another, in the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Charity and united Go&s;pel-Or|der. Then, and not till then, may we hope to <HI>&s;ee Jeru&s;alem a quiet Ha|bitation and a Prai&s;e in the Earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER impartially con&s;ults the Antiquities of <HI>New-England,</HI> will find that many of the&s;e Churches in their infant State, were infe&s;ted with <HI>Antinomian, Enthu&s;ia&s;tick</HI> and many other Errors, which gave them and the People of GOD here much trouble: As a direct and nece&s;&s;ary Effect of &s;uch Errors, nothing le&s;s can be expected but Factions and Parties, evil Surmi&s;ings and open Reflections, on &s;uch e&s;pecially as adhere to the Truth, and labour to &s;tem the Torrent of Corruption flowing in upon them: Thus it was in that Day, and thus it is with us in this Day of our <HI>Zion</HI>'s Trouble, as &s;orrowful Experience teaches us.</P>
<P>The faithful Mini&s;ters of CHRIST were then loaded with Obloquy and open Contempt, termed, <Q>No better than legal Preachers, <HI>Baal</HI>'s Prie&s;ts, Popi&s;h Factors, Scribes, Phari&s;ees, and oppo&s;ers of CHRIST him&s;elf &mdash; Such a Church-Officer is an ignorant Man, and knows not CHRIST: Such an one is under a <HI>Covenant of Works:</HI> Such a Pa&s;tor is a proud Man, and would make a good <HI>Per&s;ecutor:</HI> Such a Teacher is gro&s;ly Popi&s;h.&mdash;That they did not preach the <HI>Covenant of free Grace,</HI> and that they them&s;elves had not the Seal of the Spirit, <HI>&amp;c</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in the&s;e Times (as the &s;ame Author ob&s;erves) <Q>You might &s;ee many of the Opinioni&s;ts ri&s;ing up and contemptuou&s;ly turning their Backs upon the <HI>faithful Pa&s;tor</HI> of that <HI>Church,</HI> and going forth from the A&s;&s;embly when he began to Pray or Preach.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Then al&s;o, <Q>You might have &s;een open Contempt ca&s;t upon the Face of the whole General-Court in &s;ubtle Words, to this very Effect, that the Magi&s;trates were <HI>Ahab</HI>'s, <HI>Amaziab</HI>'s, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Enemies to CHRIST, led by Satan, that old Enemy of free Grace; and that it were <HI>better that a Mill-&s;tone were hung about their Necks,</HI> and they <HI>were drowned in the Sea,</HI> than they &s;hould cen&s;ure one of their Judge|ment.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The worthy Author proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>By a little ta&s;te of a few Pa&s;&s;ages (in&s;tead of Multitudes) here pre&s;ented, you may &s;ee what a Height they were grown to in a &s;hort Time; and what a Spirit of Pride, In&s;olency,
<PB N="2" REF="005667_0022_1026B9E400566D00">Contempt of Authority, Divi&s;ion, Sedition, they were acted by. It was a wonder of Mercy that they had not &s;et our Common wealth and Churches on fire, and con&s;umed us all therein.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few Hints taken from the Rev. Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Preface to his Book, entitled, &mdash; <HI>Sea&s;onable Thoughts on the State of Religion in</HI> NEW-ENGLAND. &mdash; A Performance aptly calculated to obviate the Objections of the pre&s;ent Day, rai&s;ed in our Churches again&s;t Mini&s;ters and others, by Per&s;ons of the like cen&s;orious corrupt Di&s;po&s;itions, with tho&s;e refer'd to above. Would to GOD, there were more found among us of the like Zeal and Concern for the&s;e Churches of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, with the renowned Patriots of the fir&s;t Times, who have endeared their Memory to after-Po&s;terities, by bearing down tho&s;e Errors than then did &s;o &s;adly a&s;&s;ault them, like the&s;e which we now feel the mi&s;erable Effects of.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o &s;erve for our Caution to take a &s;hort View of &s;ome later Occurences of the like kind, which fall within the Compa&s;s of the Memo|ries of many of us, as we find them tran&s;mitted from a Number of our venerable Fathers (two of whom are yet &s;urviving<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The venerable Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Walter</HI> and Dr. <HI>Colman.</HI></NOTE>) bearing the Title of <HI>A faithful Advice from &s;everal Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in and near</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>unto the Churches of</HI> New England; <HI>Relating to the Dangers that may ari&s;e from Impo&s;tors, pretending to be Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The manife&s;t Rea&s;ons leading to the Publication of this faithful Advice was partly from a Number of illiterate and unqualified Per&s;ons in Succe&s;&s;ion, who appeared <HI>in their Day,</HI> to &s;et up for Preachers; who were of the like make with the numerous Exhorters of the&s;e Times, and partly from the over-fondne&s;s of the People (e&s;pecially the weaker &s;ort) to hear them, which is al&s;o remarkably exemplified among us in this our Day&mdash;As a Proof whereof we have the Te&s;timony of the Rev. Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of &s;ome Impo&s;ters,</HI> &mdash; annexed to the above Advice, and written to maintain it, as he there <HI>tells us.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor gives a Relation in that &s;hort Hi&s;tory of &s;everal of the&s;e Impo|&s;ters appearing on the Stage; and al&s;o the Manner of their Exit, within the Compa&s;s of Time, between 1624 and 1699.

The won|derful Succe&s;s of <HI>Mahomet</HI> upon a World where Chri&s;tianity was to another Degree lo&s;t, than it is yet in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was no longer a wonder to us, when we &s;aw the Succe&s;s of <HI>May,</HI> in a Place of &s;o Chri&s;tian a Cha|racter as <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI>&mdash;It was all over pure <HI>Enchantment.</HI> &mdash; So &s;illy and &s;hallow a Per&s;on he was, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any but <HI>&s;uch,</HI> to be many Minutes in his Company without being &s;en&s;ible of it. The fir&s;t Thing that made &s;ome to &s;u&s;pect him was, his u&s;ing to lift up his Eyes and Hands, with Strains of Devotion, u&s;ed by none others in the A&s;&s;embly. He was able to imitate a plau&s;ible Utterance and Action, and &s;eem'd &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;et upon <HI>inviting Men to CHRIST,</HI> that after Sermon was over he would make another Speech to put them in Mind on't. Abundance of the People became &s;o fiercely &s;et for him, that they pour'd out a Thou&s;and Expre&s;&s;ions of Rage, upon the Faithful Pa&s;tors of the Town.</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>The Di&s;ciples of this <HI>Money-Catcher,</HI> became &s;o exceeding fierce many of them, that &s;ome &s;ober Men, became afraid of <HI>pa&s;&s;ing by that Way,</HI> where one mu&s;t encounter them; tho' he were detected in &s;everal Crimes, &mdash; yet his Followers would go on, making <HI>Ridi|culous Apologies</HI> for him, and <HI>malicious Invectives</HI> again&s;t any that would not believe him an <HI>Eminent Saint.</HI> Yea, they began to throw Libels into the Hou&s;es of the Mini&s;ters, the mo&s;t In&s;olent that ever I &s;aw.</P></Q>
<P>He proceeds to &s;hew the <HI>Reflections</HI> the Mini&s;ters made on the Car|riage of the People, that were <HI>May</HI>'s Admirers, which was to this pur|po&s;e, &mdash; That however long and indefatigably, they had endeavour'd to &s;erve them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>yet if any <HI>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</HI> do come with a few good Words among them; the &s;imple Souls of many, will not only follow the Wolf, but on his Account bark at the Shepherds.</Q>&mdash; Applicable to what we now &s;ee and feel tragically acted among us.</P>
<P>The Inva&s;ions the&s;e Impo&s;tors made on the Churches, as has been noted, moved our Fathers (above hinted at) to offer their Opinions on the&s;e Things, apprehen&s;ive of Danger in Time to come, and have left this their <HI>Faithful Advice</HI> as a la&s;ting Te&s;timony and Caution to the&s;e Churches for the future.
