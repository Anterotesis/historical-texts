<P>Our Text is a Rea&s;on for the Di&s;&s;ua&s;ion, taken from the Incon&s;i&s;tency of the Love of the World with the Love of GOD. <HI>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</HI> The Words intend much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of our Saviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 24.</NOTE>, <HI>No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other; ye cannot &s;erve GOD and Mammon.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For the Explanation of the Words. <HI>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</HI> By the <HI>World</HI> is here doubtle&s;s intended tho&s;e Enjoyments of the World which tend to &s;educe us, which are &s;o &s;uited to the Corruptions of Men, as that they prove a Temptation and Share to them: The&s;e are well &s;um'd up by the Apo&s;tle in the Ver&s;e following our Text under the&s;e three Heads, <HI>The Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</HI> By the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h,</HI> as it here &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;h'd, I ap|prehend, is intended tho&s;e Things which tend to pro|voke our &s;en&s;ual Appetites, and inflame our De&s;ires after fle&s;hly Delights. By <HI>the Lu&s;t of the Eyes,</HI> is to be under&s;tood tho&s;e Things which tend to feed our Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, when we earne&s;tly de&s;ire and eagerly pur&s;ue tho&s;e Things which our Eyes have &s;een. By <HI>the Pride of Life,</HI> is intended tho&s;e Things which tend to rai&s;e or cheri&s;h our Pride; &s;uch as the Honours and Dignities of the World, or whatever el&s;e tends to gratify our am|bitious Views, to exalt us in our own E&s;teem, or we are di&s;po&s;ed to take a Pride in.</P>
<P><HI>If any Man love the World.</HI> By loving the World, cannot, I think, be under&s;tood every Kind of Love to any of the Enjoyments of it; this would be to prohi|bit the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e natural Principles which are implanted in us by the God of Nature, and which are nece&s;&s;ary for us in our pre&s;ent State. Some Regard to the World and the Things of it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the
<PB N="7" REF="005386_0005_1017B54C93AF5E20">World in good Order, and for our comfortable Sub&s;i&s;|tence here; yea, for the Di&s;charge of many Duties which God requires of us. GOD commands that <HI>Hu&s;|bands</HI> love their <HI>Wives,</HI> and <HI>Parents</HI> would never do their Duty to their <HI>Children,</HI> if they had not a real Af|fection for them; Diligence in our particular Calling is our Duty, but how apt would Mankind be to indulge them&s;elves in Lazine&s;s, were it not that they have a Love to the World, and &s;ome De&s;ire to have a larger Portion of the Things of it? Nor can I &s;ee any Evil in &s;uch De&s;ires, &s;o long as our Love to the&s;e &s;ublunary Enjoyments is &s;ubordinate to our Love to GOD, and we &s;eek them with an humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the divine Will, and po&s;&s;e&s;s them with a Di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;ign them whenever GOD in his Providence calls for them; A Love to the World which is accompanied with &s;uch a Frame and Temper is, I think, lawful and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with our Love to GOD&mdash;'Tis then an <HI>inor|dinate Love</HI> to the World which the Apo&s;tle here con|demns, &s;uch a Love as influences us to be immoderate in our Pur&s;uit after it, and unwilling to part with it.

<P>If any Man love the World, <HI>the Love of the Father is not in him,</HI> i. e. he has not that &s;upreme Love to GOD, which is the Characteri&s;tick of the true Chri&s;tian, he remains in his natural Enmity to GOD, and has ne|ver experienced that Change in his Soul by which he may be denominated a Chri&s;tian.&mdash; This I take to be the plain Sen&s;e of the Words, and without troubling you with any critical Remarks upon them, I proceed</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To open and illu&s;trate the Truth contain|ed in them, or to &s;how that an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the <HI>World</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Love of GOD,</HI> Here I &s;hall &s;how</P>

I. When our <HI>Love to the World</HI> may be called an <HI>in|ordinate Love.</HI></P>
<P>For An&s;wer</P>
<P N="1">1. When the <HI>World</HI> &s;o takes up our <HI>Thoughts</HI> as to exclude the <HI>Thought of GOD and Religion,</HI> then our Love to the World may be &s;aid to be <HI>inordinate.</HI> To contemplate on GOD and Divine Things is mo&s;t wor|thy our rea&s;onable Natures, mo&s;t delightful and mo&s;t profitable to the renewed Soul: It is a Con&s;ideration which demands our clo&s;e&s;t Attention, how we may ob|tain the Favour of GOD, and how we may glorify and honour him; and it argues too great a Regard to the World, when we are &s;o attach'd to it, as that we can|not pre&s;ently call off our Thoughts from it to tho&s;e Things which are of infinitely greater Importance to us. While we are in the World, we are nece&s;&s;arily en|gaged in worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, and it mu&s;t take up much of our Thoughts; but &s;urely it ought not to have all, there ought to be &s;ome Time allotted for the Care of our Souls, which is by Way of Eminence <HI>the one Thing needful;</HI> and though the World, or the Care of tho&s;e committed to us may employ the greater Part of our Time; yet, if our Hearts are not too much &s;et upon it, our Thoughts will frequently run upon &s;piritual and divine Subjects: Yea, when we are engaged in world|ly Bu&s;ine&s;s, the&s;e will be ea&s;y and natural to us. Our Love to the World mu&s;t be an inordinate Love, if we allow our Minds to dwell wholly upon it, and never think of Divine Things, or if religious Thoughts are burden&s;ome, and we find more Delight in contemplat|ing upon the World and the Things of it: When we put by religious Con&s;iderations as <HI>Felix</HI> did <HI>Paul</HI> to a more convenient Sea&s;on, have our Minds engaged up|on our temporal Affairs all the Day long, contriving how we may buy and &s;ell and get gain, and imagine it enough if we contemplate of &s;piritual Things at the Times of our &s;tated Devotions: Nor will it be &s;o ea&s;y
<PB N="9" REF="005386_0007_1017B550024B2498">a Thing, as many think it is, to bring our&s;elves &s;utably to attend to the&s;e Subjects, and to fix our Thoughts upon them; when our Minds have been for a long Time otherwi&s;e engag'd; e&s;pecially, when they have been employed upon Subjects &s;o much more agreeable to our Corruptions: In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, you'l find it ex|tremely difficult to get your Heart di&s;engag'd from the World; it will &s;teal upon you in your Retirements, when you go a&s;ide profe&s;&s;edly to meditate on Things of a &s;piritual Nature; it will intrude it&s;elf into your De|votions, and take off your Thoughts when you would engage them el&s;ewhere. Our Care about the World is <HI>then</HI> immoderate, and our Love to it inordinate, when we put a&s;ide religious Thoughts when they come into our Minds, and will give them no Place, but on tho&s;e Times which we have expre&s;ly &s;et apart for them; &s;ure|ly then it is, if &s;uch Thoughts never come into our Minds; if the Cares of the World take up all our Time; if the&s;e lie down with us, and are fir&s;t with us when we awake; Such a Frame of Mind is a certain Indication that our Souls are &s;et upon them, and that we have a greater Regard to them than to any Thing el&s;e&mdash; <HI>As a Man thinketh in his Heart, &s;o is he.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 23.7.</NOTE> If then, any one thinketh of the World with mo&s;t Fre|quency and Delight, he is a worldly Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Love</HI> to the World is <HI>then inordinate,</HI> when we are <HI>di&s;contented</HI> becau&s;e we have not more of it. Though their ought to be a prudent Care about the Things of the World, and it is in our Nature to have &s;ome Love to it, and we may lawfully pur&s;ue after it; yet our Care and our Pur&s;uits are to be re&s;trained with|in the Bounds of Rea&s;on and Religion, and we &s;hould &s;ubmit to the Allotments of Divine Providence without murmuring or repining. It argues a very unbecoming Temper, and too great a Love to the Things of this
<PB N="10" REF="005386_0008_1017B559136C9478">pre&s;ent World; when we are fretful becau&s;e we have not more, and envious towards tho&s;e that have. Some, when they look upon others, who abound in temporal Ble&s;&s;ings and &s;eem to have all Things comfortable and plea&s;ant about them, are ready to &s;ay within them&s;elves; <Q>why, I have taken as much Pains and have had as fair Opportunities as my Neighbours, but I an't thus pro&s;per'd: This Man has Honour and Re&s;pect &s;hown him, I am &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed; another has ama&s;s'd great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions I am &s;till low in the World.</Q> Well, and what then I pray? so GOD is plea&s;ed in his Pro|vidence to order, and its all right and ju&s;t as it &s;hould be. You love the World <HI>too well,</HI> if you an't willing GOD &s;hould govern it as plea&s;es him, but are unea&s;y and di&s;&s;a|tisfied becau&s;e he does not give you as much as he does others, or as you de&s;ire. GOD has a &s;overeign Right to di&s;po&s;e of all Things here, and 'tis our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to &s;ubmit to his Will what&s;oever it is concerning us. If then you are in a contrary Frame, and can't be ea&s;y with what GOD be&s;tows upon you becau&s;e you have not more, it argues a too great Regard for the Things of the World, and that your De&s;ires after it are not kept within due Bounds, &s;ince the mere Want of it puts you into an undutiful Frame towards the ble&s;&s;ed GOD. We are ready to think there's no Danger of our loving the World too well, when we have not a great Share of it: But a covetous Temper may be as evident and prevail as much in tho&s;e, who are denied an Abundance of the good Things of this Life, as in tho&s;e who abound; though they have them not, yet they <HI>crave</HI> them, and an't <HI>contented</HI> without them: What can this proceed from but an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to them? They di&s;cover their Regard to them by their <HI>Cravings</HI> after them, as the others do by their <HI>Attachment</HI> to them when they have them: Was our Love to the World under due Regulations, though we &s;hould take a <HI>prudent</HI> Care about it, yet if our Endeavours were not crown'd
<PB N="11" REF="005386_0009_1017B55A9C3FCFC0">with Succe&s;s, it would not di&s;turb us; much le&s;s &s;hould we di&s;cover a di&s;contented murmuring Frame of Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>Love to the World</HI> is then <HI>inordinate,</HI> when we take <HI>indirect Methods to gain it.</HI> Under this Head I rank not only tho&s;e who <HI>&s;teal</HI> and are guilty of the more notorious Acts of <HI>Fraud</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> but tho&s;e al&s;o, who involve them&s;elves in <HI>Debts</HI> which they have no rea&s;onable Pro&s;pect of hone&s;tly di&s;charging, or im|prove what is due to another without his Knowledge or Con&s;ent; &s;uch as are di&s;pos'd to take every Advantage they can of their Neighbours, and embrace every Op|portunity to gripe and oppre&s;s them; &s;uch as engage in more Bu&s;ine&s;s than they can accompli&s;h and attend the Duties of Religion, or engage in unlawful Bu&s;ine&s;s: The&s;e all take <HI>indirect Methods</HI> to gain the World. I know many &s;uch pa&s;s for hone&s;t Men, and maintain a good Character; but their Character is better than they de&s;erve. There are fair open Ways enough of gaining a Sub&s;i&s;tence and Livelihood in the World, Men need not make U&s;e of &s;uch mean Methods and &s;o contrary to the Genius of the Go&s;pel; &s;uch a Behaviour <HI>can</HI> pro|ceed from nothing but <HI>an unlawful De&s;ire of Gain,</HI> they are eagerly &s;et upon growing rich, and have a Pro&s;pect of gaining more in this Way, than in any other. They may indeed per&s;uade them&s;elves that there is nothing ami&s;s in their Conduct, becau&s;e they are not guilty of o|pen palpable Acts of Inju&s;tice: but 'tis their Love to the World that deceives them; did they impartially ex|amine, many &s;uch Acts as now they think ju&s;t and hon|e&s;t would appear as <HI>really evil</HI> as open <HI>Robbery</HI> or <HI>Theft.</HI> That my Meaning may be quite plain, I &s;hall in&s;tance in two or three Ca&s;es too common among us wherein I think Men take <HI>indirect Methods</HI> to gain the World, a|greeable to the Hints I ju&s;t now gave&mdash;Such then pur|&s;ue the World in an <HI>unlawful Way,</HI> who involve them|&s;elves &s;o deeply in <HI>Debt,</HI> that they can have no Pro&s;pect
<PB N="12" REF="005386_0010_1017B55C9CA0B088">of di&s;charging their Obligations with the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure of Punctuality, and &s;o are nece&s;&s;itated to <HI>break their Word,</HI> if they have made any Promi&s;es; or at be&s;t to <HI>cheat</HI> and <HI>defraud</HI> their <HI>Creditors:</HI> Who keep that Mo|ney to <HI>trade upon,</HI> or to lay out to their Advantage, which they know to be ju&s;tly due to another, without his Knowledge or Con&s;ent, yea, when they know he wants it him&s;elf; Who never will pay their ju&s;t Debts, till they are obliged to it; but for the Sake of a &s;mall Advantage, which they hope to reap to them&s;elves, keep the hone&s;t Creditor out of his ju&s;t Due as long as they can. Call this what you plea&s;e, it is no better than <HI>Knavery</HI> and <HI>Cheating:</HI> The Money is not their own, nor have they any Right to u&s;e it; and it appears to me very little wor&s;e to take their Neighbour's Intere&s;t out of his Che&s;t, than to keep him out of what is due to him, when there is any Po&s;&s;ibility off di&s;charging the Debt; I &s;ay, when there is any Po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;charg|ing the Debt, becau&s;e an unfore&s;een Series of Accidents may put it beyond their Power to do as they ought and really de&s;ire to do: I &s;peak of tho&s;e, who will not pay their Debts when they are able, or involve them|&s;elves more deeply in Debt, then they have any Rea&s;on to hope, by a common Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Endeavours, they &s;hall be able to pay according to their Contract with and the con&s;equent Expectation of their <HI>Creditors.</HI> &mdash;Another in&s;tance, wherein Men take <HI>indirect Methods</HI> to gain the World, is this; a Man &s;ees his Neighbour in <HI>ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for a Sum of Money or &s;omething el&s;e, which he can ea&s;ily help him to, and which he knows or thinks he cannot procure el&s;ewhere; upon this he demands very large Intere&s;t, or an extravagant Price, much more than he would pretend to a&s;k, if his Neighbour was not in &s;uch extreme Nece&s;&s;ity that he could not do without it: If this is not <HI>Extortion,</HI> I confe&s;s I am ignorant what is. It is equally <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> when one Man impo&s;es upon the Ignorance of another,
<PB N="13" REF="005386_0011_1017B560824B76A0">puts off that <HI>Commodity</HI> for <HI>cheap,</HI> which he knows in his own Con&s;cience is <HI>dear,</HI> or that for <HI>good,</HI> which he knows to be <HI>bad;</HI> when he knows that the <HI>Buyer</HI> is ig|norant and depends upon him for Direction: This is a complicated Crime, there's <HI>Breach of Tru&s;t</HI> as well as <HI>Fraud</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI> And yet, in the&s;e Ways how many are pur&s;uing after E&s;tates? In &s;hort, with many the Role of Trading &s;eems to be only this; every one to get what he can, and, if he don't actually &s;teal, in what Way he can: The Worth of the Thing, the Value of their Labour or what would be a rea&s;onable Profit &s;carce come into Con&s;ideration. Others there are, who take &s;uch a Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s into their Hands, that they cannot accompli&s;h it without a Neg|lect of the more important Concerns; they are for driv|ing the World before them and &s;cruple no Methods, that won't ab&s;olutely de&s;troy their Character, to gain the Things of it; They are always in a Hurry and can &s;pare no Time to attend the Duties of Religion: Now what can &s;uch a mean ba&s;e &s;inful Temper as this pro|ceed from but an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> of the World? Would Men be thus eager after it, would they for the Sake of it &s;o abu&s;e and oppre&s;s their Neighbours, if they had a ju&s;t Contempt of it? Would they neg|lect what is plainly their Duty for the Sake of it, if they did not love it too well? I allow there may be &s;ome Ca&s;es, when we may defer or omit what would otherwi&s;e be our Duty for the Sake of taking Care of our <HI>temporal E&s;tate:</HI> As it may be a Man's Duty to omit <HI>praying in his Family</HI> at the &s;tated Sea&s;on, when he has a large Intere&s;t at Stake, or great Sums in im|minent Hazzard. But &s;uch Allowances in extraordina|ry Ca&s;es will by no Means excu&s;e an <HI>habitual Neglect</HI> of the&s;e or &s;uch like Duties: It will not be any &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for &s;uch a Conduct to &s;ay, that your proper Bu&s;ine&s;s obliges you to omit your Duty; for the Ca&s;e is plain; If it is &s;o, your Bu&s;ine&s;s is unlawful, and you
<PB N="14" REF="005386_0012_1017B56673F3B2A8">ought to lay it a&s;ide and look out for another Calling; But I believe &s;uch Pretences of want of Time for the Duties of Religion are u&s;ually fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, Men may attend them if they will, and find Time e|nough for their worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s. Ob&s;erve here, I &s;peak only of tho&s;e with Re&s;pect to <HI>Family Duties,</HI> who are at home with their Families; and not tho&s;e who are nece&s;&s;arily called at a Di&s;tance from them, as are our <HI>Seafaring Brethren</HI> and others. I &s;peak of tho&s;e who make a Practice of going out from their Families &s;o early in the Morning and returning &s;o late at Night under Pretence or really for the Sake of following their Calling, as that they have no Time to offer up their <HI>Morning and Evening Sacrifices of Prayer and Prai&s;e.</HI>&mdash; Such Men are certainly actuated by an <HI>inordinate Love to the World.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Our <HI>Love to the World</HI> is <HI>inordinate</HI> when our <HI>Anxiety</HI> about it leads us to <HI>di&s;tru&s;t the good Providence of GOD.</HI> This is the Temper of many: As others are di&s;contented becau&s;e they have not an Abundance of the good Things of this Life; &s;o the&s;e, altho' they have them, are perpetually re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, through a &s;lavi&s;h Fear of lo&s;ing them. <HI>The ambitious Man</HI> can't &s;leep, nor take any Comfort in his exalted Station, le&s;t &s;ome Change of Affairs &s;hould happen, and he &s;hould be deprived of his Honours. <HI>The rich Man</HI> is harra&s;s'd with continual Fears le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e his Sub&s;tance; when he is awake he imagines it will be &s;tole when he is a&s;leep; and the &s;ame di&s;quieting Fears di&s;turb his Re&s;t, he dreams of Thieves and Robbers and a thou&s;and Dangers when none is near him. They forget that the Mo&s;t High governs the World, and orders all Things in it with con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom, and watches over it with infinite Vigilance; and that he is able to pre&s;erve to them the Ble&s;&s;ings which he has be&s;towed upon them; the&s;e Con&s;iderations would Influence them to put their Tru&s;t in him, and to depend upon the Care of his Providence;
<PB N="15" REF="005386_0013_1017B569DCB61518">which would &s;till their Fears and quiet their Minds about Futurity.&mdash;<HI>Anxiety</HI> about the Things of the World, al|ways argues a <HI>Di&s;tru&s;t of GOD</HI> and his Providence; and &s;o it evidences <HI>too great a Love to the World;</HI> for if we loved it in Mea&s;ure, we &s;hould be re&s;igned to the di|vine Will about it, and leave our &s;elves and ours at the Di&s;po&s;al of our heavenly Father. I tell you again, I &s;peak not again&s;t a prudent Care of the&s;e Things; &s;o far as this con&s;i&s;ts with a humble Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will, and a Dependance on the good Providence of GOD, it is our incumbent Duty. I &s;peak of &s;uch an <HI>anxious Concern</HI> about worldly Enjoyments as unfits us for Duty, for Conver&s;ation, and deprives us of all Com|fort in Life. Such is the Care of <HI>Parents</HI> for their <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> when they can't bear them out of their Sight, and if at any Time they are ab&s;ent from them, are fill'd with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Fears le&s;t &s;ome Accident &s;hould befal them, altho' the &s;ame careful Providence watches over them then as at other Times.

Such a Temper of Mind is a certain Indication that our Hearts are <HI>too much &s;et on the World.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Our <HI>Love to the World is inordinate,</HI> if we are <HI>loth to part with it,</HI> when there is <HI>proper Occa&s;ion</HI> for it, or are <HI>angry when GOD in his Providence takes it from us.</HI> It is an evident Truth; that, as GOD has given us all we enjoy, &s;o, he has a Right to command us how we &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it, or, if he plea&s;e, to take it from us: It argues therefore, that we have a greater Love to the World than we ought to have, if we are unwilling to improve what he gives us according to his Will and Command, or murmur and fret, when he &s;ees fit to de|prive us of it: If we can &s;ee <HI>Objects of Charity</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="005386_0014_1017B56B64C9FFD0">not relieve them; or if it troubles us when we meet with them; if we put them off with good Words, in|&s;tead of generous Actions; or if we give grudgingly and and with Reluctance: If its a Burthen to us to &s;upport the Go&s;pel, or to be&s;tow of our Sub&s;tance for other pious U&s;es; one who has only a religious Regard to the&s;e Things would give as freely as he receives, he con&s;iders his E&s;tate as a Talent given him to improve, for the Improvement of which he mu&s;t be accountable to GOD; under the Influence of this Con&s;ideration, his chief Care is, how he &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of the&s;e Things &s;o, as will be&s;t an&s;wer the Ends for which they were given him; he rejoices therefore, when he has an Opportu|nity of &s;erving GOD or relieving his Brethren, and is willing to part with all for the Sake of CHRIST: I mean not, that, in ordinary Ca&s;es, any one is obliged to give <HI>all he has</HI> in Charity; the State of the World or of the Church of CHRIST is not &s;uch as to require it; but a good Proportion of our Income ought to be re|&s;erved for this Purpo&s;e; and a greater as there &s;hall be a Call in Providence for more. How va&s;tly <HI>too great</HI> then is their Love to the World, who can't bear to &s;pend a Penny either to promote the Kingdom of CHRIST or to relieve the Nece&s;&s;itous, and had rather their Money &s;hould ru&s;t in their Che&s;t, than take it out to keep a <HI>Brother</HI> from &s;tarving?</P>
<P>It proves the &s;ame <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the World, if we find a Di&s;po&s;ition to repine at the Providence of GOD, when he takes away any wordly Enjoyment; if we can't chearfully, at lea&s;t without murm'ring, give up our Character, E&s;tate and every Thing el&s;e, when GOD calls for them, or acquie&s;ce in the Providence which deprives us of them; if we are apt to think hardly of GOD and behave undutifully towards him when he is plea&s;ed to remove <HI>Relatives</HI> near and dear to us. We ought never to &s;et our Affections upon any Creature to &s;uch a Degree, as that the Lo&s;s of it &s;hould over|bear

<P N="6">6. When Men <HI>pur&s;ue</HI> the World with <HI>greater Ea|gerne&s;s</HI> than they do the <HI>Favour of GOD</HI> and the <HI>Trea|&s;ures and Joys of Heaven,</HI> then is their <HI>Love to the World</HI> an <HI>inordinate Love.</HI> When they are warm, eager and diligent to &s;ecure any worldly Advantage, and are cool, lazy and indolent about obtaining an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and &s;ecuring the Trea&s;ures of Heaven: When they make the World, the main Object of their Pur&s;uit, and Religion a Thing by the by: When they neg|lect the Care of their Souls rather than the Care of the World: When they are very &s;ollicitous to &s;ecure the Honours, Riches and Plea&s;ures of this World, and are under no Concern to be found unto Prai&s;e, Honour and Glory in the other World: Such a Temper evident|ly di&s;covers a <HI>too great Love</HI> to the World; becau&s;e the mo&s;t valuable Objects ought always to be pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t Diligence; as then the Things of the World are no Way to be compared with the Advanta|ges which accrue from the Love and Favour of God; &s;o our Love to them mu&s;t be inordinate if we prefer them &s;o as more earne&s;tly to follow after them.</P>
<P N="7">7. Our <HI>Love to the World</HI> is <HI>too great,</HI> if the <HI>Enjoy|ments</HI> of it afford us <HI>greater Delight</HI> than the <HI>Service</HI> of GOD and <HI>Communion</HI> with him. We always delight mo&s;t in tho&s;e Things which we love be&s;t; the Service and Company of others is plea&s;ant and agreeable in Proportion to the Love we bear to them; according to this Rule we may determine which has the highe&s;t Place in our Affections GOD or the World: If we delight in the Service of GOD and prize the Enjoy|ment of him above every Thing here, then he has the
<PB N="18" REF="005386_0016_1017B5746325FC60">&s;upreme Place; but if we take more Delight in the Things of the World, it is becau&s;e we love it be&s;t; and we certainly love the World too well, if we love it better than GOD who is the <HI>&s;upreme Good.</HI> Their <HI>Love to the World</HI> is therefore <HI>inordinate</HI> who &s;erve God with an unwilling Mind; who think it hard to be ta|ken off from their worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s to attend the Du|ties of Religion, and account the Sabbath and other Times which they &s;pend in religious Exerci&s;es, to be lo&s;t Time, and long to get into the World again; who can't keep their Hearts engaged, when they draw near to GOD with their Bodies; but &s;uffer their Tho'ts to wander with the <HI>Eyes of the Fool</HI> unto <HI>the Ends of the Earth</HI>&mdash;Such Men have no Ta&s;te for the Plea&s;ures of Religion, nor do they prize the Manife&s;tations of Divine Love: The utmo&s;t De&s;ire of their Souls and the plain Language of their Practice is <HI>who will &s;hew us any</HI> worldly <HI>Good.</HI> If they lo&s;e any Part of their earthly Sub&s;tance, they can grieve and mourn, nor can they take Satisfaction and Comfort from the Con&s;ide|ration of the infinite Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the hea|venly Trea&s;ures which are promi&s;ed in the Word of GOD: But they can bear the Ab&s;ence of GOD and the Light of his Countenance without any Concern of Mind or Emotion of Spirit, and have no Unea&s;ine&s;s at the Want of Communion with him. If the World &s;miles upon them, they di&s;cover no Sollicitude about &s;piritual Plea&s;ures, or the Evidences of the Divine Fa|vour. Such a Temper is a <HI>clear Evidence</HI> that we love the World <HI>too well:</HI> Every Thing ought to plea&s;e us according to its real Value and the Degree of &s;olid Plea&s;ure it is capable of affording: If then the Plea|&s;ures of Religion, which re&s;ult from Communion with and the Enjoyment of GOD are &s;uperior to any which the World can afford us, as I take it for granted they are, it argues that we have too great a Value for the
<PB N="19" REF="005386_0017_1017B577D947F450">Enjoyments of the World, if we prefer them to the other. There can't be a clearer Evidence of an <HI>inor|dinate Love</HI> to the World, than when we pur&s;ue after the Plea&s;ures of it with greater Eagerne&s;s than we do &s;piritual Enjoyments, when we prize them more in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and mourn more for the Ab&s;ence of them.</P>
<P N="8">8. When Mon <HI>pride</HI> them&s;elves in the Things of this World, it proves that they have an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to them. This is extremely natural to Man; to value them&s;elves upon &s;uch Things as di&s;tingui&s;h them from others, and to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who in the&s;e Re&s;pects are inferior to them; hence they expect great Deference and Re&s;pect, are offended if they are not con&s;ulted in every Thing, are touchy and wa&s;pi&s;h, won't bear Con|tradiction or endure Controul: Thus, its &s;trange to &s;ee, how &s;ome empty Wretches expect a Deference to their Judgment becau&s;e they are rich; as if Riches procured them Brains and they were Men of Sen&s;e be|cau&s;e they had large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: So likewi&s;e as to Honour and other Things, they oftentimes put Men above them&s;elves, &s;o that they are in a Rage at the lea&s;t Slight, yea, if they are not preferred before others. Now what can &s;uch a proud haughty Spirit proceed from, but an Over-valuation of tho&s;e Qualifications they are endowed with, or tho&s;e Enjoyments they po&s;|&s;e&s;s? They think more highly of them than they ought to think: This mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e when we pride our&s;elves in any worldly Enjoyment, becau&s;e they are none of them &s;o valuable, as that we can have any Rea&s;on to be proud of them; and this high Opinion of them mu&s;t proceed from an undue Affection to them: Tho&s;e Objects which we love, we are always apt to think better of and to imagine them more va|luable than they really are: Our Love to them cau&s;es us to look upon them with Prejudice, it blinds our Eyes,
<PB N="20" REF="005386_0018_1017B579CC5FC538">&s;o that we don't &s;ee the Imperfections of the Object we love, and fancy a Thou&s;and Excellencies which are only imaginary. This is the Foundation of Pride, this is therefore an Evidence of an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the World.</P>
<P N="9">9. and la&s;tly, Our <HI>Love</HI> to the World is then <HI>inor|dinate,</HI> when we de&s;ire only to keep within the Bounds of <HI>Duty,</HI> and allowedly proceed to the very <HI>Limits of what is lawful.</HI> A Chri&s;tian ought never to be con|tented without Growth in Grace, it &s;hould be his con|tinual Care to get at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from Sin and to pre&s;s towards Perfection. But how contrary to this is the Conduct of a great Part of the Chri&s;tian World, of tho&s;e who make a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion? They would be Chri&s;tians and that is all; they de&s;ire ju&s;t to e&s;cape Hell and get to Heaven and no more; they re|tain their Reli&s;h for &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, as did the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> for the <HI>Leeks</HI> and <HI>Onions</HI> of <HI>Egypt;</HI> they have not &s;uch a Love to Holine&s;s as that they de&s;ire to be more holy; they'll readily gratify their Lu&s;ts and pur|&s;ue the World, as far as they imagine they may venture to do it without forfeiting their Title to Heaven: As for &s;uch as behave with more Strictne&s;s, and endeavour to be Examples of Holine&s;s, they &s;tigmatize them as <HI>Preci&s;ians, Phari&s;ees</HI> and what not, while they them|&s;elves behave with &s;uch Levity, and approach at lea&s;t &s;o near the Borders of Vice, as is a Scandal to Religion and a Di&s;grace to their holy Profe&s;&s;ion. Now what can &s;uch a Behaviour as this proceed from but an <HI>inor|dinate Love</HI> to the World? The&s;e Men have not lo&s;t their Affection to it, though they may have re&s;trained them&s;elves from the more gro&s;s Acts of Sin; they flatter them&s;elves that they have renounced the World, whereas they have only reformed their Lives after a Sort, but their Hearts are the &s;ame, and they retain the &s;ame Affection to the World. Why el&s;e have they &s;uch
<PB N="21" REF="005386_0019_1017B57E4C219B28">an Inclination towards it and the Things of it? Why do they give them&s;elves &s;uch a Licence, to go to the <HI>utmo&s;t Bounds</HI> of what is lawful, and allow them&s;elves in the Gratification of their &s;en&s;ual Appetites, &s;o far as is not plainly &s;inful; When they ought to endeavour to get at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from the Ways of Sin, and as near to Perfection as they po&s;&s;ibly can? This is a <HI>certain Evidence</HI> that they have an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to this World and the Things of it. Thus I have &s;hown, by &s;uch Hints as came to my Mind, what it is to have an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the World.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;ay Secondly.</P>
<P N="2">II. That an <HI>inordinate Love of the World</HI> is <HI>incon&s;i&s;|tent</HI> with the <HI>Love of GOD.</HI> But here I would pre|mi&s;e, that no <HI>particular Act of inordinate Love</HI> to the World is enough to determine that we have not Love to GOD: Alas! We are all too worldly carnal and &s;en&s;ual: The World &s;teals upon the be&s;t and too often interrupts their Communion with GOD and draws away their Hearts from him. But I &s;peak of the <HI>habitual</HI> Frame and Temper of the Mind; when an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> of the World is the <HI>prevailing reign|ing Di&s;po&s;ition of the Soul,</HI> the Love of GOD is not there.&mdash;For fir&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. Where there is <HI>true Love to GOD</HI> he has the <HI>&s;u|preme Place</HI> in the <HI>Affections:</HI> That Di&s;covery of him which attracts our Love to him at all, will influence us to love him above every Thing el&s;e. &mdash; There is natu|rally in our Souls a Principle of Enmity to the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, which re&s;ults from this Con&s;ideration, that he is holy, ju&s;t and true, and that we are odious to his Holine&s;s, obnoxious to his Ju&s;tice and expos'd to the Execution of his Threatnings: This Enmity there|fore can never be removed, 'till the Cau&s;e is taken
<PB N="22" REF="005386_0020_1017B585192E9C08">away; which mu&s;t be by a Change both of our State and our Nature: Which Change is effected when GOD is pleas'd effectually to call us by his Grace: Our <HI>State</HI> is then changed by GOD's <HI>free ju&s;tifying Act</HI> on Account of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST im|puted to us on our receiving him by Faith; our Nature is changed by the <HI>Operation of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> work|ing all his Graces within us. When this Change is effected, GOD is no longer an Object of Hatred; the Cau&s;e of our Enmity is removed, we are not the Objects of his Anger or Di&s;plea&s;ure; he is reconciled to us and engaged for us; and his Goodne&s;s in &s;hewing Mercy to &s;uch guilty Rebels, as we all are in our natu|ral State, now recommends him to our Love, as much as his other Attributes render'd him hateful to us be|fore: Yea, tho&s;e &s;everer Attributes of the Deity are now amiable and lovely: his Holine&s;s e&s;pecially, when we are &s;anctified our&s;elves, excites our E&s;teem and Love; and all his Excellencies, which now &s;hine upon the Soul with peculiar Lu&s;tre, e&s;pecially as they are mani|fe&s;ted in the Face of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> have this attractive Influence. And the &s;ame Con&s;ideration which induces us to love him at all will con&s;train us to love him a|bove every Thing el&s;e: We love every Object ac|cording to the Goodne&s;s or Excellency there <HI>appeares</HI> to us be in it; as then after we are changed and re|newed by the Holy Spirit, GOD evidently appears to the Soul the be&s;t and mo&s;t excellent Being; &s;o he will love him be&s;t: He will then &s;ee the Emptine&s;s and Vanity of the Creature, when compared with GOD, and therefore will de&s;pi&s;e it. That which induces a|ny to love the World, is the Good which they think there is in it, it's Suitablene&s;s to their De&s;ires, Appe|tites and Inclinations and the Pro&s;pect of Happine&s;s they have from it: But the renewed Soul has his In|clinations &s;o changed that he no longer De&s;ires the &s;in|ful
<PB N="23" REF="005386_0021_1017B5888D543F28">Plea&s;ures of the World, nor any Portion of it any further than is needful for his Sub&s;i&s;tence, or than he can improve to the Glory of his Maker. He is con|vinced that the World cannot yield him Happine&s;s; that there is that and infinitely more in GOD, than he can expect from the World; and he looks for Happine&s;s from him and not from &s;ublunary Enjoyments.&mdash; As then GOD, by the Di&s;coveries which he makes of him&s;elf to the true Chri&s;tian, appears to him not of him&s;elf to the true Chri&s;tian, appears to him not only the greate&s;t but the be&s;t of Beings; as all he hopes for is from him; and he &s;ees evident|ly, that no Creature is of any Service, or can yield any Plea&s;ure, or be of any Value, but by his Appointment; &s;o he loves him with a &s;upreme Affection; yea, he de&s;pi&s;es every Thing in Compari&s;on with him. 'Tis true, he &s;till loves the World, but with a &s;ubordinate Love, according to its real U&s;e, and in its proper Place. Where there is not &s;uch a &s;upreme Love to God, there is no Love to him; this is the natural nece&s;&s;ary Effect of that Change, which the Spirit of GOD makes in the Soul of a Sinner, when he renews and &s;anctifies it.&mdash;</P>
<P>But to go on Secondly,</P>
<P N="2">2. This <HI>inordinate Love</HI> of the World is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Love of GOD becau&s;e it naturally leads to <HI>Acts directly contrary to the Will of GOD:</HI> Or other|wi&s;e, becau&s;e the Service of GOD and the World are incon&s;i&s;tent. The ble&s;&s;ed GOD requires us to devote our&s;elves to him, and to u&s;e the World &s;o as &s;hall mo&s;t glorify him: But an <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the World leads us to devote our&s;elves to that, and to improve it in the Gratification or our Lu&s;ts. GOD commands us to mortify our Members and curb our Lu&s;ts: The World pre&s;ents us with Objects which tend to inflame our De&s;ires and provoke our Lu&s;ts. GOD commands us to &s;et our Affections on Things above and not on
<PB N="24" REF="005386_0022_1017B58A4BF4AB40">Things below: The World would engage our Affections upon earthly Enjoyments and repre&s;ents the other as no Way &s;uitable for us, and therefore not to be valued. GOD commands us to <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the King|dom of GOD and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> the World would entice us to neglect the&s;e Things till the la&s;t. GOD tells us that he is the alone Fountain of Happine&s;s: The World would have us to &s;eek it in the Enjoyments of Sen&s;e. GOD commands us to give him our whole Heart, to love him with <HI>all our Heart;</HI> but this is ab|&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with an inordinate Love of the World. <Q>GOD, &s;aith, (to allude to the Words of another,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Henry. Expo&s;ition upon Mat 6.24.</NOTE> <HI>My Son give me thy Heart:</HI> The World &s;aith, no, give it me. GOD &s;aith, <HI>Be con|tent with &s;uch Things as you have:</HI> The World &s;aith, gra&s;p at all that ever thou can&s;t. GOD &s;aith, defraud not, never tell a Lie, be hone&s;t and ju&s;t in all thy Dealings: The World &s;aith, cheat thy own Father, if thou can&s;t get by it. GOD &s;aith, be charitable: The World &s;aith, hold thy own, this giving undoes us all. GOD &s;aith, <HI>Be careful for no|thing:</HI> The World &s;aith, be careful for every Thing. GOD &s;aith, <HI>Keep holy the Sabbath Day:</HI> The World &s;aith, make U&s;e of that Day, as well as any other for the World. Thus incon&s;i&s;tent are the Commands of GOD and the World, &s;o that we cannot &s;erve both.</Q> Agreeably our Saviour tells us in forecited Matth. 6.24. <HI>No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, for either he will hate the one and love the other. Or el&s;e he will hold to the one and de&s;pi&s;e the other. Ye cannot &s;erve GOD and Mammon.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the APPLICATION of what has been &s;aid; and,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="25" REF="005386_0023_1017B58DE57FC310">
1. I &s;hall apply what has been &s;aid for the <HI>Convic|tion</HI> and <HI>Awakening</HI> of tho&s;e who <HI>have</HI> that <HI>inordinate Love of the World,</HI> which has been de&s;cribed. Many &s;uch there are, 'tis to be fear'd, who yet think them|&s;elves good Chri&s;tians. They mi&s;take their Greedine&s;s after the World for Prudence, and their Covetou&s;ne&s;s for Frugality: And upon this Principle, they blame others of a more generous charitable Di&s;po&s;ition, charge them with Extravagance, would have them think whe|ther they can afford what they give in this Way, whe|ther they &s;ha'n't hurt them&s;elves and Families. In|deed, my Brethren, there is but little Need in our Day for &s;uch Cautions as the&s;e: Few, very few are in Danger of hurting them&s;elves or their Families by what they give in pious and charitable U&s;es; the mo&s;t give but a Trifle in this Way. But, (&s;uffer me to &s;peak my Fears) if I mi&s;take not, the mo&s;t of you are in much greater Danger of loving the World too well. Look into your own Hearts then (for GOD calls you to apply the&s;e Truths to your&s;elves rather than to others.) What are your Thoughts employ'd about? Is it not, how &s;hall I buy and &s;ell and get Gain? How &s;hall I advance my E&s;tate? How &s;hall I lay out my Money to the be&s;t Advantage? I &s;ay not, that all &s;uch Tho'ts are &s;inful; but don't they take up &s;o much of your Time, that you &s;hut out the Care of your Soul and neglect to &s;ecure the <HI>one Thing need|ful?</HI> I verily believe that many think more how they &s;hall get or &s;ave a Penny, than how they &s;hall &s;ave their Souls from Hell. Is not their Love to the World then inordinate? Is it not too great to have any Room for GOD in the Heart?</P>
<P>Again, What meaneth this Bleating in our Ears? What is all this Murmuring and Fretting that you have not more of the World? That you mu&s;t toil and labour and yet be poor, while others get E&s;tates
<PB N="26" REF="005386_0024_1017B591CFCB8888">without half the Pains you take? Is not your Mur|muring again&s;t the Lord? Is it not he that allots out every one's Circum&s;tances?

I &s;peak not only to Thieves and open Robbers, but to many who would think it hard if their Goodne&s;s was to be &s;u&s;pected: Such as op|pre&s;s the Poor and lie in wait to take Advantage of the Nece&s;&s;ities of their Brethren: Such as have no Rule in Dealing, but to get as much as they can, and take extravagant Intere&s;t, when their Neigh|bours, through Nece&s;&s;ity, are obliged to borrow of them: Such as will commend their Goods when they know them to be bad; and will take the Bread out of their Brethren's Mouths, to lay up Money in their Che&s;ts: who are growing rich upon the Spoils of others, and defraud others to rai&s;e them&s;elves.&mdash;Is this your Way to get E&s;tates? poor Souls! You'l peri&s;h with your Money unle&s;s you repent.</P>
<P>Again, What Occa&s;ion for that Anxiety and Di&s;tre&s;s which many di&s;cover le&s;t they &s;hould not have enough to carry them thro' the World? Is there not a GOD in Heaven who&s;e Care has been extended towards you, ever &s;ince you have been in the World? How un|becoming a Chri&s;tian is it, when he &s;hould be com|mitting
<PB N="27" REF="005386_0025_1017B5975C6C4A78">his Ca&s;e to GOD, to unfit him&s;elf for Duty, through a re&s;tle&s;s Anxiety about Futurity.</P>
<P>Again, You have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect your State; who are as &s;tingy when you have got Money, as you was avaricious in getting it.&mdash; How hard is it to get any Thing out of &s;ome Men, when the Honour of GOD plainly calls for it! How many Excu&s;es do they make; its hard Times, I've a large Family. I allow there's &s;omething in the&s;e Things, but will this excu&s;e you from doing any Thing for the Service of GOD? Or if &s;ome Men give, yet with what ap|parent Reluctance is it? It &s;eems as if they had al|mo&s;t as willingly give a Piece of their Fle&s;h, it &s;o evi|dently hurts them; and I'm &s;ure, it hurts me, when I &s;ee &s;uch Men give.&mdash; GOD loves a <HI>chearful Giver,</HI> but he hates &s;uch mean, &s;ordid, &s;tingy Souls.</P>
<P>Again, How melancholly is your Ca&s;e, who can take Delight in the World, and the Things of it, but none in the Service of GOD: Who take great Plea|&s;ure in getting the good Things of Life, but none in conver&s;ing with GOD: Who are ea&s;y if you can but procure large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to your&s;elves, though you have no Communion with GOD, no Manife&s;tations of the Divine Love.&mdash;Or who can labour and toil to get earthly Riches, but can find no Time to &s;care to &s;ecure the infinitely preferable Trea&s;ures of Heaven. This World's Goods you may po&s;&s;ibly get, but, if you carry this Temper with you to the Grave, the other you &s;hall never have, the&s;e Things will be &s;uch a heavy Weight upon you as will &s;ink you deep in the bottom|le&s;s Pit.&mdash;Need I &s;ay any Thing to &s;et forth the Dan|ger of tho&s;e who are puff'd up with Pride, on Account of what they enjoy here? Your Folly is inexcu&s;able and your Danger is great, that &s;ince you &s;o abomina|bly mi&s;improve the Bounty of Heaven towards you, he will at Length take an effectual Way to humble
<PB N="28" REF="005386_0026_1017B598E18471C0">you, even by leaving you to contemplate on your Vanity with Shame and Grief to all Eternity. As for &s;uch as are for being religious and worldly too, who are for getting a little Grace, ju&s;t enough to <HI>&s;queeze</HI> in at the &s;trait Gate; who de&s;ire no more than ju&s;t to get over the Line between a converted and uncon|verted State; I fear you'll be &s;o cautious of going too far, that you won't go far enough.&mdash;In plain Words, &s;uch a Temper di&s;covers you are a Stranger to Con|ver&s;ion and know nothing of the Power of Godline&s;s. Oh be awaken'd and convinced then, all the&s;e Kinds of Per&s;ons, I have been de&s;cribing love the World too well, too well to have any Love to GOD, too well to be Chri&s;tians. &mdash; But Secondly,</P>
<P N="2">2. What has been &s;aid may &s;erve to reprove the Children of GOD. Alas do not the be&s;t of us find that we love the World too well: Though tho&s;e Tempers I have mentioned, are not the habitual Frame of our Minds; yet are they not too often prevailing, within us? Have we not had Rea&s;on to judge and condemn our&s;elves more than once while we have heard an inordinate Love to the World de&s;crib|ed? But how is this, my Brethren! have we not cho&s;en GOD as the Object of our Hope and Tru&s;t? Does he not de&s;erve that Affection we have placed upon him? Yea, have we not found more Plea&s;ure in the little Communion we have had with him, and the little Time we have been &s;erving him than in all that the World has afforded? Have we not found the World empty and vain; and that 'tis GOD only can &s;atisfy our De&s;ires? Why then do we return a|gain to the World, or expect that from it which we know by Experience it cannot yield us? Shall we who have partook of the <HI>Fountain of living Waters,</HI> go back again to tho&s;e <HI>broken Ci&s;terns that can hold no
<PB N="29" REF="005386_0027_1017B59A7639DDD0">Water?</HI> Shall we halt <HI>between two Opinions,</HI> who have determined upon &s;o good Grounds for the Lord, and have cho&s;en his Service? Oh rou&s;e up, contem|plate on the Excellencies of the Divine Nature, and you'll &s;ee &s;o much to attract your Love, that you'll de&s;pi&s;e every Thing which the World pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>There are two Rea&s;ons e&s;pecially, which &s;hould in|fluence the Children of GOD not to di&s;cover too great an Affection to the Things of the World. The one is the bad Influence it is like to have upon others; they are ready to think they are within due Bounds, becau&s;e they &s;ee &s;uch a good Man as eager and anxious about the World as they&mdash;the bad Example of good Men has a great Influence upon others: they &s;hould therefore endeavour to di&s;cover their Contempt of the World and to &s;how the little Value they put upon it that others may follow them, may examine the real Value of it, and be brought to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e it. The other Rea&s;on is that it will cloud their Evidences for Heaven if they &s;uffer their Hearts to go out after the World. The Way to have our Title to the hea|venly Inheritance clear'd up, is to get weaned from the World and more conformed to the heavenly World. The more worldly we are, &s;o much the more Darkne&s;s are we like to have about our State, the more we are like the Men of this World, the more difficult it will be to determine that we are not of it our&s;elves. And this may di&s;cover to many of us the Rea&s;on, why we have not had more of the Light of GOD's Coun|tenance: We have been too worldly, too eager in our Pur&s;uits after it, too anxious about the Things of it, when we ought to have con&s;ider'd our&s;elves as Pil|grims and Strangers here, and lived as &s;uch.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. But I would ju&s;t &s;ay one Word for the Encou|ragement of &s;ome poor di&s;con&s;olate Souls, who are
<PB N="30" REF="005386_0028_1017B59FEBE5AFA8">ready to conclude every Thought about the World unlawful, and to give all over for lo&s;t, becau&s;e they are not &s;o weaned from it as they think they &s;hould be. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e: You can't expect to be free entirely from the Cares of the World; while you are here, you mu&s;t and you ought to think about it, and to take Care for your comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence here. As to the other, I am inclin'd to think it's true, that you are not &s;o weaned from the World as you ought to be: But is not this your Grief, your Burden? Don't you long to get more wean'd? Don't you mourn before GOD that you are &s;o much attach'd to the World? And pray that you may have Grace to with&s;tand the Temptations of it? Don't you watch again&s;t it, and &s;trive again&s;t it, and don't you long to be free from the Snares of it? This is not the Temper of tho&s;e, who have an habitual inordinate Love to the World, but are the genuine Marks of a Child of GOD.</P>
<P>In fine, Let us all be exhorted to <HI>moderate our Affec|tions</HI> to the Things of this World, and to place them on GOD and CHRIST and Things that are heavenly and Divine. Your own Experience will teach you, that all Things here are empty, vain, and un&s;atisfactory; whatever we promi&s;e our&s;elves from the Enjoyment of them, we find our&s;elves di&s;appointed, and &s;till a great Way off from that Ea&s;e and Contentment which we expected from them. It is not in their Nature to &s;a|tisfy the boundle&s;s De&s;ires of our rational Souls.&mdash;Be|&s;ides, all &s;ublunary Enjoyments are fading and peri&s;hing; they <HI>make to them&s;elves Wings and flee away;</HI> they will &s;oon leave us, or if not, we mu&s;t &s;oon leave them; and if we choo&s;e our Portion here, we mu&s;t go with|out it hereafter, if the World engro&s;&s;es our Affections while we are in this State, we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable fore|ver.&mdash;Shall we &s;uffer the&s;e Things then to engage our
<PB N="31" REF="005386_0029_1017B5A3E17C5F58">Attention, our Affections, our De&s;ires, and Pur&s;uits, which are &s;o mean in them&s;elves and &s;o fatal in their Con&s;equences? E&s;pecially, when they come in Com|petition with the <HI>Trea&s;ures of Heaven,</HI> which are infi|nitely valuable in them&s;elves, and eternal in their Durati|on? The&s;e, my Brethren, are worthy your clo&s;e&s;t At|tention; you can't be too earne&s;t in your De&s;ires, or too eager in your Pur&s;uit after them. Oh then, <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Labour to make &s;ure of an Intere&s;t in CHRIST, he is the <HI>Pearl of, great Price;</HI> and if you can but make him your's, tho' it be at the Expence of all you have in this World, you'll gain infinitely by the Bargain, you'll find that Happine&s;s in Communion with and in the Enjoyment of him, which you vainly expect from the Things of this World, and infinitely more: in him there are <HI>un|&s;earchable Riches, it has plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all Fulne&s;s dwell,</HI> he can &s;atisfy your mo&s;t enlarg|ed De&s;ires, and make you as happy, as without him you mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. &mdash; If you are intere&s;ted in his Merits, you &s;hall have Grace and Glory, nor will GOD withhold any good Thing from you. If GOD &s;ees it to be for your Good, he will be&s;tow the Enjoyments of this Life upon you, for &s;o far <HI>Godline&s;s has the Pro|mi&s;e of this Life</HI> as well as <HI>of that which is to come.</HI> And what rea&s;onable Man would de&s;ire the Promi&s;e of it any further? But however GOD may &s;ee fit to deal with you here, you &s;hall be admitted to the riche&s;t Happine&s;s in the Glory of the heavenly World. I conclude with Col. iii. 2, 5. <HI>Set your Affections on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth. Mortify your Members which are upon the Earth&mdash;inordinate Af|fection, evil Concupi&s;cence, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is Idolatry.</HI></P>
