<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little E&s;&s;ays, were drawn up many years ago, partly as helps to moral and divine conference, in a religious &s;ociety, and partly as the re&s;ult of &s;uch conferences. They are generally the re&s;ult of free, and pretty enlarged and comprehen&s;ive meditations on the &s;ubjects they treat of, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch thoughts as occurred fir&s;t and mo&s;t obviou&s;ly to the open mind, in its free and unfettered di&s;|cur&s;ions on &s;aid &s;ubjects;&mdash;and they were meant meerly as hints to &s;tart the conver|&s;ation, and to keep it alive, and to the bu|&s;ine&s;s in hand, that it might not deviate in|to wild and impertinent digre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIS will account for the Nature and Form of the E&s;&s;ays, which are very &s;ingu|lar and uncommon. They con&s;i&s;t of a num|ber of loo&s;e, general, and often, unconnect|ed Aphori&s;ms, or general Maxims, com|monly clo&s;ed by &s;ome practical corollaries or inferences of the greate&s;t moment.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="014137_0003_0F97D456095F0C40">
THE primitive de&s;ign of them, was to convey the mo&s;t ample, general in&s;truction to the mind on every &s;ubject treated of; yet &s;o, as that in&s;truction might exhau&s;t the &s;ubject in Miniature, as it were, or, in the narrowe&s;t compa&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with per|&s;picuity, &mdash;and that the method of explain|ing the &s;ubjects, &s;hould be calculated, as much as po&s;&s;ible, for affecting the heart by proper motives, and &s;tirring up men to the diligent practice of the virtues and duties explained. And I hope the judicious and intelligent Chri&s;tian reader will find, up|on an attentive peru&s;al of the E&s;&s;ays them&s;elves, that they are not ill adapted to this purpo&s;e; excepting, perhaps, a few, which are more &s;uperficial than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IT had been ea&s;y to have filled up the&s;e Skeletons of Doctrine, and lengthened them out to the ordinary &s;ize of pulpit di&s;cour&s;es. In this form they would have had, doubt|le&s;s, many advantages which they are now nece&s;&s;arily deprived of: In this form, they would have admitted of Connexion, Argu|mentation, Illu&s;tration, Per&s;ua&s;ion, Pathos,
<PB N="v" REF="014137_0004_0F97D45674DD14C0">and all the Graces and Beauties of fine Com|po&s;ition; whereas, their pre&s;ent form nece&s;|&s;arily precludes the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, in &s;uch a form, they would have been very volumnious and expen&s;ive: Few would have purcha&s;ed them, and perhaps, fewer read them. The pre&s;ent volatile, irreligious ta&s;te, nau&s;eates e|very thing prolix in divinity. Five or &s;ix pages of a religious book is as much as we can, in con&s;cience expect, that a modern fine Gen|tleman or Lady &s;hould read at one &s;itting. The ta&s;te of the times is, therefore, purpo&s;e|ly con&s;ulted in the &s;hortne&s;s of the&s;e E&s;&s;ay</P>
<P>A PERSON of this &s;queami&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, may here read, in eight or ten minutes, &s;ome of the mo&s;t important things which can be &s;aid on each of the&s;e &s;ubjects, without break|ing off abruptly, in the mid&s;t of the &s;en&s;e, and lo&s;ing the whole chain of connexion.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if the E&s;&s;ays are tolerably exe|cuted on this plan, the doctrinal aphori&s;ms contained in them, &s;hould be &s;o plain and &s;elf-evident, as to &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of arguments and illu&s;trations; the prac|tical
<PB N="vi" REF="014137_0005_0F97D459EFB9D988">corollaries &s;hould flow &s;pontaneou&s;ly and con&s;equentially from the&s;e aphori&s;ms, and the whole &s;hould be demon&s;tratively built upon the &s;criptures referred to in the margin.</P>
<P>AFTER having humbly recommended the&s;e imperfect E&s;&s;ays to the public candour and indulgence, and implored the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon them, for the general good; if I might pre&s;ume to offer my advice to my fellow-creatures concerning the be&s;t way of u&s;ing them,&mdash;it would be as fol|lows: That they would read them, in their private and devout retirements, as Hints for Meditation on the&s;e important &s;ubjects, lay|ing their minds open, without prejudice, to the influence of divine truth, and earne&s;tly imploring the Father of lights to write the&s;e truths and virtues with &s;un-beams upon their under&s;tandings; convey them warm to their hearts, and make them powerfully opera|tive and influential on all the active powers and faculties of their nature.</P>
<P>I HAVE added the Sermons as &s;ome com|pen&s;ation to tho&s;e who may di&s;reli&s;h the dryne&s;s of many of the E&s;&s;ay</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>of</HI> CONVERSION, <HI>or</HI> REGENERATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. RELIGION being a <HI>character,</HI> mu&s;t have a <HI>principle;</HI> and this principle mu&s;t &s;upreme|ly govern and predominate in the life. We do not call a man <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>friendly,</HI> unle&s;s genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip prevail in him above churli&s;hne&s;s and un|friendline&s;s, and are fixed principles in his nature.&mdash;So it would be equally ab&s;urd to call a man <HI>religious,</HI> only becau&s;e of the performance of a few outward religious duties, while the main of his temper and character is irreligious and immoral. <HI>He</HI> only de&s;erves the charac|ter of being <HI>religious,</HI> who is &s;uch uniformly and predo|minantly, and in whom morality and religion is a pre|vailing and di&s;criminating character!</P>
<P N="2">2. TRUE religion, where it is, mu&s;t govern the man; and nothing can do this but an <HI>inward principle.</HI> Grace, which is this principle, mu&s;t oppo&s;e corruption, and fi|nally prevail over it.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE word of GOD, and indeed the nature and rea|&s;on of things, place religion primarily and radically in the <HI>heart,</HI> and repre&s;ent it as flowing thence into the life and conver&s;ation. The heart, as it is the &s;ource and fountain of all external corruption, &s;o it mu&s;t be of all true religion. The tree mu&s;t fir&s;t be made good before
<PB N="10" REF="014137_0009_0F97D45C7671D208">its fruit can be good. A bitter or polluted fountain, can|not &s;end forth pure or &s;weet water. Men gather not grapes of thorns, nor figs of thi&s;tles. Good principles are nece&s;&s;arily prerequi&s;ite to <HI>morally</HI> or <HI>formally</HI> good ac|tions. Accordingly, the whole &s;tre&s;s is laid, in &s;cripture, upon <HI>heart-religion;</HI> or that which is &s;eated and radicated in the heart, and proceeds from pure and right principles and motives there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26. Ezek. xxxvi. 26.&mdash;xviii. 31. Joel ii. 12, 13. P&s;al. li. and cxxxix. 1 Sam. xvi. 7. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Deut. xiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it has been the general opinion of mankind, as well as the voice of &s;cripture, that men are born into this world in a <HI>depraved, corrupt</HI> and <HI>irreligious</HI> &s;tate, with &s;trong propen&s;ities to vice, and a di&s;inclination to that which appears to be virtuous and good, by the very law of their nature, written on their con&s;cience, and mani|fe&s;ted to them by their moral in&s;tinctive feelings; &s;o it has been generally thought the peculiar work of the Dei|ty, the GOD and <HI>Father</HI> of men, to help them, by his grace and Spirit, to ri&s;e out of this &s;tate of depravity and corruption, and to return to his obedience, favour and enjoyment, in the &s;teep and narrow path of virtue and piety. This has ever been thought a care and work wor|thy of GOD the Father of &s;pirits, towards his human off|&s;pring; and even a heathen could &s;ay, <HI>Nullus vir magnus unquam fuit, &s;ine Divino afflatu.</HI></P>

<P N="6">6. OUR Lord &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es both the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of this change in &s;inners, by telling them, <HI>That unle&s;s they are born again of water, and of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>are converted,</HI> they not only <HI>&s;hall not,</HI> but even <HI>cannot, enter in|to the kingdom of heaven</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3, 5.

That the change of a &s;inner by conver&s;ion or regeneration, mu&s;t be <HI>exceeding great,</HI> bearing &s;ome analogy to the difference between the circum&s;tances of a child before and after its birth;&mdash;or between a being in a &s;tate of non-entity, and after the commencement of its exi&s;tence, in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential re&s;pects at lea&s;t.&mdash;(2.) That it is not a <HI>partial,</HI> but an <HI>univer&s;al</HI> change; a change of the whole bent of the heart and drift and direction of the affections.&mdash;(3.) That it is not a meer <HI>outward, imperfect</HI> change, but one that is <HI>in|ward, e&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>complete.</HI>&mdash;(4.) That it is a change not produced by the &s;inner's own natural powers and endea|vours, but <HI>wholly &s;upernatural,</HI> the product of a <HI>divine a|gency,</HI> effected and produced by the Spirit of God: And (5.) That it is a change ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every &s;on and daughter of Adam, in order to their entering in|to the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P N="8">8. EITHER the&s;e inferences are plainly and clearly de|ducible from the&s;e metaphors; or, otherwi&s;e, the me|taphors mu&s;t not only be &s;uppo&s;ed highly <HI>improper,</HI> but even <HI>pernicious;</HI> tending to mi&s;lead the judgments of men, and ob&s;curing a doctrine of great importance to men's &s;alvation, otherwi&s;e plain and obvious in it&s;elf,
<PB N="12" REF="014137_0011_0F97D45DF68978B8">which would be a high imputation on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, and an unan&s;werable objection again&s;t the revelation of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. SELF-LOVE, a <HI>de&s;ire of reputation</HI> and <HI>fame,</HI> and a prin|ciple of <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>&s;lavi&s;h fear,</HI> often produce a kind of re|ligious character, which is merely outward and greatly imperfect.</P>

<P N="1">1. THE &s;cripture evidence of the wretched &s;tate of man <HI>by nature,</HI> is very exten&s;ive. Among a va&s;t multitude of &s;criptures, the following may be con&s;ult|ed; P&s;al. li. 5. Eph. ii. 1, 3. Job xiv. 4. P&s;al. xiv. 1&mdash;3. Jer. xvii. 9. I&s;a. lxiv. 6. Rom. vii. 14, to the end.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST is &s;aid to have come as a phy&s;ician to the <HI>&s;ick,</HI> and to &s;eek that which was <HI>lo&s;t.</HI> The prodigal is re|pre&s;ented as <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> and his conver&s;ion is termed a <HI>coming to him&s;elf,</HI> a <HI>being found,</HI> and a <HI>coming again to life.</HI> Conver&s;ion is termed a <HI>new birth,</HI> a <HI>new creation;</HI> and &s;in|ners, before conver&s;ion, are &s;aid to be <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> The unconverted man is &s;aid, <HI>not to receive the things of the Spirit of</HI> GOD; <HI>they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him,</HI> neither <HI>can he know them.</HI> Conver&s;ion is repre&s;ented as a work of great power; &s;uch as GOD exerted in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him up from the dead.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM all the&s;e &s;cripture repre&s;entations we may infer the exceeding <HI>helple&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> of &s;inners, in an uncon|verted &s;tate. A dead per&s;on hath no power to ri&s;e. We cannot come to Chri&s;t unle&s;s the Father draw us. We cannot think a good thought. All our &s;ufficiency is of GOD, who mu&s;t work in us both to will and to do; and without Chri&s;t we can do nothing. We cannot be con|verted
<PB N="14" REF="014137_0013_0F97D45F773F2C58">without the Spirit: But the Spirit is the Father's free gift in Chri&s;t. He mu&s;t open our eyes before we can <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and create us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before we can <HI>&s;piritually live</HI> and <HI>act.</HI> Faith is the fir&s;t grace acted by a converted Chri&s;tian; and yet this faith we cannot act of our&s;elves, <HI>it is the gift of</HI> GOD. We are naturally cor|rupt and di&s;inclined to good before our conver&s;ion, and <HI>here</HI> lies our helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, until God by his quickening Spirit gives life to our &s;ouls, and enables us to will and to do, and creates us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us to good works.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM <HI>rea&s;on, ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> we have the following evidences of this truth: (1.) We know good and evil by our natural con&s;cience; yet we find in our|&s;elves a &s;trong di&s;inclination to the good which we ap|prove, and a prevailing inclination to the evil which we di&s;approve.&mdash;(2.) We know that we are very unlike GOD, and that we do not cordially love and chu&s;e him and his laws: But GOD could not form creatures with &s;uch a temper: This therefore proves, that we are now degenerated from our fir&s;t &s;tate, and become corrupt creatures.&mdash;(3.) If children come into the world &s;uch as we may &s;uppo&s;e that God fir&s;t created man, <HI>i. e. holy,</HI> and with a <HI>propen&s;ity to good,</HI> or even in a &s;tate of indif|ference to good and evil; &s;ome would &s;urely be virtu|ous from the womb upwards; &s;ome would &s;urely follow the good principle of their nature, e&s;pecially as <HI>prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> lie on that &s;ide; but univer&s;al ob&s;ervation and experience prove the contrary, as well as the word of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. liii. 1,&mdash;3. Rom iii. 10, &amp;c.</NOTE>.&mdash;(4.) If men were not born corrupt and impo|tent, a virtuous and religious education would bring all who are ble&s;&s;ed with it over to the &s;ide of virtue, in &s;pite of evil example: But do we not plainly &s;ee that chil|dren are backward to imitate good examples, and prone to follow bad ones? They greedily &s;uck in evil advice and the knowledge of wicked things; but it requires
<PB N="15" REF="014137_0014_0F97D4603433B948">much labour to bring them to learn good; they al&s;o quickly forget it, and we plainly &s;ee that their heart is &s;till corrupt and &s;trongly inclined to vice, in &s;pite of all the antidotes we can in&s;til into their minds again&s;t it.&mdash; (5.) If we attentively examine our own hearts, lives and experiences but for <HI>one day,</HI> we &s;hall have an overpower|ing conviction of our dreadful corruption. How readi|ly do we forget GOD? How aver&s;e are our minds to the contemplation of him and his perfections? How little do we think of the love of Chri&s;t? We read or hear with unconcern, the amazing &s;tory of his love, and feel little or no gratitude for it. Our memories, our thoughts, our meditations, the general bent and tenour of our affecti|ons and pa&s;&s;ions, even our religious duties, and our very be&s;t works, may convince us of the wretchedne&s;s of our &s;tate by nature.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE &s;ee that a virtuous and Chri&s;tian education cannot, of it&s;elf, recover our natures, or remove their corruption.&mdash;We &s;ee that the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy and the knowledge of the &s;criptures, cannot accompli&s;h this. &mdash;We &s;ee that the mo&s;t powerful preaching, and be&s;t adapted means of grace, cannot effect this great change. &mdash;We &s;ee men making many vows and re&s;olutions, and labouring hard in the way of outward means, to ri&s;e from their corruptions, and yet all prove ineffectual.&mdash; We have often, in an unconverted &s;tate, been convinced of our guiltine&s;s and danger; we have often re&s;olved to do better, and we have bound <HI>our re&s;olutions</HI> with <HI>&s;olemn vows:</HI> &mdash;We have even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a time to begin a better life; but before that time came, our re&s;olutions have proved as the morning cloud. And even when we have at|tempted to mend our life and conduct, have we not found our&s;elves &s;o exceeding feeble, as to be unable to effect any thing to purpo&s;e? Have we not felt, as it were, a dead weight pulling us backwards, and &s;inking us down into the bed of &s;loth, carnal &s;ecurity and inaction?

<P N="1">1. THOUGH GOD hath re&s;erved in his own hands the great work of Conver&s;ion, as his <HI>own proper work,</HI> and we cannot therefore convert our&s;elves; yet we ought not to &s;ay that we can do nothing. GOD hath given to unconverted &s;inners a great deal of important work to do, and put it in their power to do it;&mdash;hath obliged them by commands, per&s;uaded them by exhor|tations, awed them by threatenings, engaged them by motives, encouraged them by promi&s;es, and given them rea&s;on to expect that he will meet with them and con|vert them in the performance of this work. He hath al|&s;o laid their help on one who is mighty to &s;ave.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALTHOUGH unconverted &s;inners are <HI>&s;piritually dead,</HI> yet they are not <HI>naturally &s;o.</HI> They have an under&s;tand|ing, a will and a memory: They may know &s;omething of their guilt and danger: They may under&s;tand &s;ome|thing of Chri&s;t and his &s;aving de&s;ign: They may read and hear, think and meditate on GOD'S word; frequent his hou&s;e, and attend his ordinances. But if &s;inners will not do the&s;e things, they will not do what they <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>are able</HI> to do, and therefore are inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P N="3">3. A DISPENSATION of GOD'S Spirit attends his go&s;|pel, and he hath promi&s;ed to give his Spirit to them
<PB N="17" REF="014137_0016_0F97D461B68C9598">that a&s;k him; to <HI>all</HI> that a&s;k him, without limitation or re&s;erve. He hath even made it the duty of &s;inners to a&s;k this Spirit, and to attend diligently on divine ordi|nances, which are the walks of the Spirit. Now, if &s;in|ners know that they cannot be converted without this Spirit, and that they cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven, unle&s;s they are converted; and if, notwith&s;tand|ing they know this, they do not diligently a&s;k it of GOD, nor attend on tho&s;e in&s;trumental duties and means of grace, in the u&s;e of which this Spirit is di&s;pen&s;ed, then they are wholly to blame for continuing uncon|verted.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD is following &s;inners with the common influ|ences and operations of his Spirit; &s;triving with them, and &s;eeking admittance into their hearts. Now, if &s;in|ners would obey and cheri&s;h this common operation, and a&s;k the &s;pecial and converting influences of the Spirit, he has obliged him&s;elf by promi&s;e to give it them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 9,&mdash;13.

<P N="4">4. THE unconverted are enemies to GOD by wicked works; full of natural antipathy and enmity again&s;t his being, nature, will and laws. The principle which prevails in their hearts, would naturally lead them to

<P N="5">5. SUCH continue under the guilt of all the &s;ins they ever have committed. Every law and threatning in the Bible is again&s;t them: They are condemned already; &s;entence is already pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them in numberle&s;s places; &s;o that nothing but the &s;lender and precarious thread of pre&s;ent life &s;u&s;pends the execution.</P>
<P N="6">6. THEY are on the very brink of perdition, moment|ly in danger of dropping into a place and &s;tate of end|le&s;s mi&s;ery.

<P N="8">8. IF they were perfectly known, their ca&s;e would be pitied, and their nature hated, by every good per&s;on on earth. And the angels and other holy &s;pirits, &s;o far as they know them, do thus regard them.</P>
<P N="9">9. IF &s;uch did thoroughly know their own wretched and perilous condition, they could not po&s;&s;ibly enjoy one moment's peace, tranquility or happine&s;s in this life.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The &s;ame Subject continued. <HI>Mi&s;takes about Conver&s;ion rectified.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT has been already ob&s;erved, that conver&s;ion is a <HI>thorough</HI> and <HI>remarkable</HI> change; and therefore, that tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t be deceived, who imagine them|&s;elves to have been truly converted, merely becau&s;e of &s;ome <HI>outward, partial,</HI> and <HI>incomplete</HI> change which they may have undergone, either from difference in age and circum&s;tances in life; alterations in their health, con&s;ti|tution, or intere&s;ts and connexions; the principles of &s;elf-love, honour and reputation; legal pannies and ter|rors, or from fal&s;e and incomplete views of religion. It may now be ob&s;erved <HI>negatively,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT <HI>chri&s;tian bapti&s;m</HI> cannot be that conver&s;ion or regeneration, to which the promi&s;e of heaven is an|nexed: For we are expre&s;ly told, that unle&s;s a man is born again of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as of <HI>water,</HI> he <HI>cannot</HI> en|ter into the kingdom of GOD. Be&s;ides, many baptized per&s;ons, are among&s;t the wickede&s;t of men, and have evident and ab&s;olute need of &s;piritual regeneration.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="014137_0025_0F97D469F479BF10">
(2.) THE <HI>bare profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> even of a <HI>true religion,</HI> how|ever &s;pecious, is not conver&s;ion: El&s;e all the profe&s;&s;ors of a true religion would be <HI>true converts;</HI> which we know is far from being the ca&s;e in fact. Much le&s;s,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) CAN it con&s;i&s;t in a man's changing his religious profe&s;&s;ion: For this may be, and often is done from <HI>worldly, intere&s;ted, luerative</HI> motives, and <HI>fal&s;e, erroneous</HI> principles, and not from convictions of truth and duty.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) STRONG convictions of &s;in, and great fear of GOD'S wrath, cannot, of them&s;elves, prove a &s;inner to be truly converted. If &s;o, we mu&s;t conclude, that <HI>Cain, Herod, Pilate, Simon Magus</HI> and <HI>Judas I&s;cariot,</HI> were true converts, which is not true in fact; becau&s;e the terrors of the&s;e unhappy men did not i&s;&s;ue in true repentance.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) AN <HI>external &s;ober, moral conduct,</HI> a life free from the gro&s;s outward acts of &s;in, and a regular attendance on the ordinances of religion, are no certain evidences of conver&s;ion, though they may ju&s;tly command the re&s;pect and e&s;teem of our fellow-men. This was the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Phari&s;ees:</HI> It is al&s;o the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of mo&s;t hypocrites and formali&s;ts: And yet our Saviour, who knew and detected the real characters of the&s;e men, has a&s;&s;ured us, that unle&s;s <HI>our righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hall <HI>exceed theirs,</HI> we &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the king|dom of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) A MAN'S really renouncing and abandoning &s;ome &s;in or &s;ins, to which he has been addicted, cannot prove him a true convert, while he continues in the love and practice of other &s;ins. <HI>Herod</HI> heard <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> gladly, and did many things in obedience to his mini&s;|try, which were not much again&s;t his natural inclina|tion; but would by no means part with his beloved lu&s;t, his darling <HI>Herodias</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark vi. 20, 23.</NOTE>. Men do many things of this kind from meer prudential motives, and becau&s;e the&s;e &s;ins are de&s;tructive of their health, intere&s;t and re|putation:
<PB N="27" REF="014137_0026_0F97D46AB4476470">But he who offends <HI>wilfully, allowedly</HI> and <HI>per|&s;everingly</HI> in one point, is guilty of the whole law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James ii. 10.</NOTE>; and plainly &s;hews that he de&s;pi&s;es the authority by which it is enjoined, and obedience to it enforced.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) A MAN'S &s;hewing remarkable zeal in religion, is no certain proof that he is a true convert, or a real Chri&s;tian. Zeal is either <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> according to the <HI>objects</HI> about which it is employed, the <HI>motives</HI> from which it originates, and the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> with which it is exerci&s;ed. If zeal be <HI>according to knowledge,</HI> it can hardly exceed in the mea&s;ure of it; for it is always good to be zealou&s;ly affected in a good thing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 18.</NOTE>: But a <HI>blind, ignorant</HI> and <HI>mi&s;guided</HI> zeal, is the mo&s;t furious, mi&s;chiev|ous and de&s;tructive of all the pa&s;&s;ions. The apo&s;tles knew not what manner of &s;pirit they were of, when in a paroxi&s;m of their frantic zeal, they called for fire from heaven to de&s;troy the <HI>Samaritans</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 25.</NOTE>. As touching zeal, <HI>St. Paul,</HI> when <HI>Saul,</HI> per&s;ecuted the church of Chri&s;t, and de&s;troyed that which he &s;hould have built up<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Read Acts ix. Gal. i. 13, &amp;c. Phil. iii. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT has been already &s;aid, <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> and I here re|peat it, That conver&s;ion is a <HI>great, univer&s;al, radical</HI> change of the &s;oul, by the regenerating influences of the Spirit of GOD,&mdash;not of the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of the &s;oul; but of its <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>principles;</HI>&mdash;not &s;uch as to preclude all &s;in and corruption in this life; but &s;uch as cau&s;es pie|ty and virtue to predominate in the character, and as it lays a foundation for <HI>progre&s;s in holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>final perfection.</HI> It is, in &s;hort, a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>divine nature</HI> and <HI>principle,</HI> gene|rating a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>divine life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>foreruaners</HI> and <HI>concomitant attendants</HI> of this change, are generally, as follows: (1.) This change is preceded by &s;uch a conviction of guilt and pollution, as deeply humbles the &s;oul before GOD, and makes it
<PB N="28" REF="014137_0027_0F97D46B7541DD88">feel it&s;elf expo&s;ed to eternal mi&s;ery; that it is <HI>helple&s;s</HI> and <HI>lying at unde&s;erved mercy,</HI> and that it <HI>mu&s;t peri&s;h,</HI> if it re|ceives not <HI>this mercy.</HI>&mdash;(2.) By &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in, as cau&s;es the &s;oul to abhor it, and to wi&s;h above all things to be freed from its dominion and pollution.&mdash; (3.) By &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the depravity and badne&s;s of the &s;inner's heart, as makes him &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of its being changed by divine grace, and makes him wi&s;h, above all things to be truly regenerated.&mdash;(4.) By &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the &s;inner's inability to change his own heart and af|fections, as makes him feel that it never can be done, unle&s;s GOD is plea&s;ed to take the work wholly into his own hands.&mdash;(5.) By &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the &s;inner's <HI>need of Chri&s;t,</HI> as makes him &s;ee his help in him alone, &s;o as earne&s;tly to de&s;ire to embrace him; to be united to him, and found in him:&mdash;And <HI>finally,</HI> by &s;uch a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of the power and grace of Chri&s;t, his all-&s;ufficien|cy to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t, and his fulne&s;s and &s;uit|ablene&s;s to all the &s;inner's wants and de&s;ires, as engages the &s;inner, as a <HI>lo&s;t, &s;in-&s;ick, peri&s;hing</HI> creature, to ca&s;t him|&s;elf chearfully into the hands of this glorious, compa&s;&s;i|onate Redeemer, with a full and un&s;haken confidence, that he will work the great &s;alvation <HI>in him</HI> and <HI>for him,</HI> and give him a complete victory over every enemy.</P>

<P N="2">2. THE converted &s;oul knows and &s;ees GOD in quite a different manner from what was u&s;ual. A <HI>new</HI> and <HI>glo|rious</HI> light &s;hines now on all his <HI>perfections, providences, laws</HI> and <HI>works.</HI> In its unrenewed &s;tate, it had indeed a &s;peculative knowledge of GOD, which &s;truck it at times, with wonder and admiration: But now GOD appears in|comparably glorious and amiable; a fit object of the &s;oul's love and choice, and its de&s;irable portion. For|merly, it could ob&s;erve his wondrous works and adorable providences, without con&s;idering GOD in them: But now the whole world &s;eems full of GOD; GOD appears more or le&s;s to the &s;oul in every work, in every provi|dence, in every mercy, and in every affliction: and the &s;oul &s;ees and approves his <HI>glory</HI> and <HI>beauty,</HI> his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> his <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> in all; is charmed with the&s;e manife&s;tations of him, and follows hard after him as its <HI>only</HI> and <HI>all-&s;ufficient portion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE converted &s;oul has quite a new kind of know|ledge and apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to what it formerly had.

2. As far as it is known, it rejoiceth the heart of every good per&s;on upon earth. The whole church mi|litant rejoice in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. To bring &s;inners to <HI>repentance</HI> and <HI>final happine&s;s,</HI> is the chief de&s;ign of all the manife&s;tations of GOD to men, and of all his great and memorable tran&s;actions on earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. To effect this was the grand de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's <HI>in|carnation, mini&s;try, miracles, labours, &s;ufferings,</HI> a&s;cen&s;ion to glory, and pouring down the gifts and graces of the Holy Gho&s;t, on his apo&s;tles and on the church.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. GOD'S merciful nature invites, allures, and en|courages &s;inners to repentance and conver&s;ion. He hath no plea&s;ure in the final mi&s;ery of &s;inners, but that they &s;hould turn from their way and live.&mdash;<HI>This</HI> he <HI>&s;o|lemnly &s;wears</HI> by his &s;acred life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</NOTE>.

<P N="9">9. WE are apt to think the de&s;criptions given in &s;crip|ture of hell and everla&s;ting mi&s;ery and torment, very di&s;gu&s;ting; but the &s;ole de&s;ign of <HI>the&s;e repre&s;entations</HI> is to alarm the fears of &s;inners by the pro&s;pect of this mi&s;ery, that &s;o they may be brought to a &s;peedy and effectual conver&s;ion. <HI>Hell</HI> would never have been re|vealed to &s;inners, had it not been, that knowing the&s;e ter|rors of the Lord, they might be per&s;uaded to repentance.</P>
<P N="10">10.

<P N="11">11. GOD'S having brought down the terms of his great &s;alvation &s;o low, and made it &s;uch a po&s;&s;ible, fea|&s;ible and practicable thing for &s;inners to be &s;aved, will render them wholly inexcu&s;able, if they continue un|converted, and &s;o come &s;hort of &s;alvation.

3. JUSTIFICATION is a foren&s;ic or law-term, oppo&s;ed to <HI>condemnation.</HI> Now condemnation never &s;ignifies the <HI>making of men guilty,</HI> but only <HI>pronouncing them &s;o;</HI> in like manner, ju&s;tification never &s;ignifies making men holy, but only declaring them to be &s;uch in the eye of the law.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s: Now, to <HI>impute,</HI> is to e&s;teem any character or quality to belong to a per&s;on as his.</P>
<P N="5">5. A THING may be imputed to a per&s;on, which was always his own: So <HI>&s;in</HI> is imputed to a &s;inner, when he is treated as an offender; in like manner, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is ju&s;tly imputed to a per&s;on, who has always obeyed the law.</P>
<P N="6">6. A THING, <HI>quality</HI> or <HI>character</HI> may al&s;o be imputed to a per&s;on, which was not <HI>always</HI> or <HI>originally</HI> his own, but is only e&s;teemed to belong to him, in the eye of the law: Thus, a debt is imputed to the <HI>&s;urety,</HI> and his payment of it is imputed to the <HI>debtor,</HI> and reckoned <HI>his act</HI> and <HI>deed.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THIS &s;eems to be the proper notion of <HI>imputation</HI> in the pre&s;ent doctrine. Chri&s;t as our &s;urety, has under|taken to <HI>pay our debts,</HI> i. e. <HI>to atone for our &s;ins.</HI> Our &s;ins are, therefore, imputed to him, and accordingly he &s;uf|fers for them, as though they had been his own: And his righteou&s;ne&s;s is freely and graciou&s;ly imputed to us, if we are indeed believers, &s;o that we may plead it be|fore GOD as <HI>our ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And <HI>therefore</HI> it is that GOD ju&s;tifies and acquits us as righteous, even for the &s;ake of his dear Son's righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we accept and plead by faith.</P>
<P N="8">8. As <HI>&s;inners</HI> we may be &s;aid to owe a <HI>double</HI> or <HI>twofold debt</HI> to GOD, which mu&s;t be paid before we can be ju&s;ti|fied. We owe him <HI>perfect obedience</HI> to the law, through the whole of our lives; and <HI>this</HI> would indeed ju&s;tify us, if we were innocent creatures, and did perfectly fulfil
<PB N="38" REF="014137_0037_0F97D4746F072B58">this condition of the fir&s;t covenant: But being now <HI>&s;in|ners,</HI> we owe the debt of <HI>eternal puni&s;hment,</HI> and the debt of <HI>perfect obedience</HI> al&s;o, (our obligations to which, as the creatures and &s;ubjects of GOD, can never be cancelled:) Now, we are equally unable to pay <HI>either</HI> of the&s;e debts. As the puni&s;hment which we owe is <HI>eternal,</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>ever</HI> paying it, and never &s;hall have paid off the &s;core.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>The Doctrine of Ju&s;tification, through the imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the doctrine of ju&s;tification, by the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, we are not to apprehend GOD as mi&s;taking our real characters, and e&s;teeming us perfect|ly righteous, when indeed we are not: On the contrary, he con&s;iders us as being ju&s;t what we are, <HI>poor, &s;inful men,</HI> who have fulfilled the demands of his law, only by the obedience of our &s;urety.</P>
<P N="2">2. NOR ought we to e&s;teem our&s;elves the <HI>more righte|ous</HI> or <HI>worthy,</HI> on account of our being thus ju&s;tified, but as unworthy and hell-de&s;erving as ever: Con&s;equently, this doctrine is &s;o far from mini&s;tring to &s;piritual pride, that, when rightly under&s;tood, it mu&s;t tend greatly to humble the ju&s;tified believer; &s;eeing tho&s;e who are <HI>thus ju&s;tified,</HI> are &s;till <HI>ungodly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is imputed to none but <HI>true believers; i. e.</HI> &s;uch as have truly received Chri&s;t, and are united to him by faith: For, in thus receiving him, we receive his <HI>per&s;on, offices</HI> and <HI>benefits,</HI> and con&s;e|quently, <HI>his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is one of tho&s;e benefits, <HI>freely</HI> offered in the go&s;pel to all who will accept it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS righteou&s;ne&s;s is not imputed to a &s;inner be|fore he has faith, nor is the imputation of it delayed till the fruits of faith appear; but the moment a &s;inner be|lieves, it is imputed to him, and he is ju&s;tified<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 24, 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. BUT that this doctrine may appear in a &s;till more <HI>clear, convictive</HI> and <HI>unexceptionable</HI> point of light: (1.) It
<PB N="40" REF="014137_0039_0F97D47580C65D40">is evident, that man is naturally and nece&s;&s;arily under law to GOD; and this is equally true of all created be|ings. (2.) Some kind of righteou&s;ne&s;s is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to man's ju&s;tification. (3.) That righteou&s;ne&s;s which ju&s;tifies man, mu&s;t be &s;uch as an&s;wers to the per|fection of that law under which man is. (4.) The law was at fir&s;t given to man for <HI>two di&s;tinct</HI> ends; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> To &s;ignify GOD'S will, enjoined by his authority for the rule of man's duty; and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> As a covenant between GOD and man, according to which, man was to expect life or death eternal, as he <HI>&s;hould</HI> or <HI>&s;hould not</HI> fulfil the terms of it. Now, this law, in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e of it, is abrogated by the bringing in of a <HI>better covenant;</HI> but in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e, the law, as a <HI>rule of duty, obliging to obedience,</HI> is of perpetual obligation. In <HI>this &s;en&s;e,</HI> Chri&s;t came to <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;h the law,</HI> and has incorporated it into his go&s;pel, in its utmo&s;t purity, as the <HI>law of his kingdom,</HI> and the <HI>rule of his &s;ubjects.</HI> It is therefore a righteou&s;ne&s;s an&s;werable to the demands of <HI>this law,</HI> which alone can ju&s;tify us.

<P N="5">(5.)

<P N="1">1. FAITH is properly an a&s;&s;ent of the under|&s;tanding to the truth of &s;ome te&s;timony: It ought always to re&s;t on <HI>&s;ufficient evidence,</HI> and is either <HI>hu|man</HI> or <HI>divine,</HI> according to the te&s;timony which it re|&s;pects.</P>
<P N="2">2. HUMAN faith is an a&s;&s;ent to the te&s;timony of <HI>men,</HI> and admits of various degrees, from ab&s;olute di&s;belief, to a firm per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="014137_0045_0F97D478F58A2D40">
3. THE firme&s;t foundation of human faith, is, when a number of men, of good character and competent judges of the matter which they te&s;tify, perfectly agree in their te&s;timony;&mdash;when they lay down their lives in confir|mation of it, without any view of intere&s;t in propagat|ing a fal&s;ehood;&mdash;and when numbers, who are declared enemies to their te&s;timony, yet confe&s;s the principal matters of it. On this foundation &s;tands our belief of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o far as it is a <HI>matter of fact,</HI> which recommends it&s;elf to our under&s;tandings by <HI>ex|ternal evidence.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="7">7. IF it be true, that we ought to <HI>have rea&s;on</HI> to be|lieve what we do believe; or, that we ought to believe <HI>only upon &s;ufficient evidence,</HI> it will follow, that every be|liever of Chri&s;tianity &s;hould endeavour to be well ac|quainted with the evidences of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, both <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of entering into</HI> COVENANT <HI>with</HI> GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A COVENANT is a <HI>&s;tipulation</HI> or <HI>agreement</HI> between <HI>two</HI> or <HI>more</HI> parties, wherein certain terms and condi|tions are to be fulfilled, and certain benefits received upon their performance. But if any of the parties fail to perform their &s;tipulations they become <HI>covenant-break|ers;</HI> the other party is ab&s;olved from its obligation, and the covenant becomes <HI>void.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="49" REF="014137_0048_0F97D47B366F3DE0">
2. IN all covenants between men, there is a <HI>parity</HI> or &s;ome kind of <HI>equality</HI> between the parties contracting; and by rea&s;on of that natural liberty, which is the inviolable, unalienable privilege of every human creature, with re|gard to his fellow-men, the <HI>contract, &s;tipulation,</HI> or <HI>agree|ment</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>free</HI> and with <HI>full con&s;ent,</HI> and the terms and conditions of the covenant, &s;uch as both parties &s;hall mutually con&s;ent to. So that the mo&s;t dig|nified or powerful mortal, can have no right to force any conditions upon his fellow-men, or bind them to any duties, which they do not freely and voluntarily con|&s;ent to; only upon this provi&s;o, that they have by &s;ome crime, <HI>forfeited their natural liberty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing act of conde&s;cen&s;ion, that ever GOD vouch&s;afed, to enter into covenant with man, as <HI>his creature,</HI> and much more, as his <HI>&s;inful, obnoxious creature.</HI> As his <HI>creature</HI> and <HI>natural &s;ubject,</HI> it was &s;ufficient that GOD gave to man <HI>a law,</HI> with <HI>a penalty:</HI> As a <HI>&s;inful creature,</HI> and <HI>rebellious &s;ubject,</HI> man had no right to expect any thing el&s;e but puni&s;hment, without any covenant-privileges or mercies.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD, when he created man a moral agent, did, in the &s;tate of his innocence, enter into a covenant with him, the equitable terms of which were, <Q><HI>Do,</HI> and <HI>live;</HI>&mdash; <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>die.</HI></Q> Man had power to keep this co|venant of life; but if he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it, there was no provi&s;ion made in the covenant of <HI>pardon</HI> for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, or of <HI>new &s;trength to obey.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. WHEN man had broke the fir&s;t covenant, and for|feited all title, not only to GOD'S <HI>covenant goodne&s;s,</HI> but even to mercy,&mdash;(wonderful <HI>grace!</HI>) GOD was plea&s;ed to enter again into covenant with man. And this la&s;t co|venant is well termed a <HI>covenant of grace;</HI> becau&s;e it is founded on the <HI>free, unde&s;erved</HI> grace of GOD, and the merits of the Redeemer;&mdash;and becau&s;e GOD'S grace and Spirit are &s;tipulated in it, to enable man to ri&s;e from his fallen
<PB N="50" REF="014137_0049_0F97D47BF414E6A8">&s;tate, and to give him &s;trength to fulfil the conditions of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. GOD being not only the <HI>Maker</HI> and rightful Lord of man, and infinitely <HI>holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good;</HI> but fallen man having al&s;o forfeited his life,&mdash;GOD, I &s;ay, has a right to propo&s;e the covenant to man, and to fix the terms and conditions of it; and it is infinitely right that man enter|ing into covenant with his Maker and Redeemer, &s;hould be willing to &s;ign a <HI>charte blanche.</HI> Yet does not GOD force the will of man to con&s;ent to his gracious cove|nant, but only propo&s;es it to him; &s;hews him the equi|ty and advantage of his complying with it, and <HI>gently moves</HI> him to his duty and intere&s;t, by the motives of his go&s;pel and attractions of his holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="7">7. GOD'S freely tendering this covenant to &s;inners of mankind, is a &s;ufficient warrant and encouragement for our taking hold of it, and entering into covenant with him; which, without this warrant, would &s;eem dreadful pre&s;umption in &s;uch <HI>creatures</HI> as we are.</P>
<P N="8">8. GOD'S part of the covenant is all a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>gracious promi&s;e</HI> of &s;omething which we <HI>do not,</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> proper|ly <HI>de&s;erve</HI> or <HI>merit</HI> by any thing we can do;&mdash;and our part of it is <HI>all duty,</HI> which we were bound to perform antecedently to any covenant promi&s;e:&mdash;And even our <HI>ability</HI> to do this duty, and perform the&s;e conditions, on which we are entitled to covenant ble&s;&s;ings, is promi&s;ed and offered in the covenant it&s;elf. <Q>I will be their GOD, and they &s;hall be my people.&mdash;I will give grace and glory, and no good thing will I withhold from them that walk uprightly.&mdash;I will take away the hard and &s;tony heart, and will give them an heart of fle&s;h.&mdash;I will write my law on their heart, and put my fear in their inward part&mdash;and I will be their GOD, and they &s;hall be my people.</Q></P>

<PB N="51" REF="014137_0050_0F97D47CB423DEB0">all covenants between men, the parties fulfil their own conditions, independently on each other. But GOD not only <HI>propo&s;es the covenant,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>gives &s;trength</HI> and <HI>ability</HI> to fulfil the conditions on their part;&mdash;puts his Spirit into their hearts; writes his law in their inward part,&mdash; and often makes them a <HI>willing people in the day of his pow|er.</HI> The very covenant it&s;elf <HI>offers</HI> and <HI>conveys grace</HI> and <HI>&s;trength</HI> to fulfil it.</P>
<P N="10">10. ALTHOUGH we are not properly at liberty whether we &s;hall chu&s;e GOD as our covenant GOD, or enter into covenant with him, or not;&mdash;but are obliged both by <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to do it, and to do it without he&s;itation or delay; yet our chu&s;ing him, and entering into covenant with him, mu&s;t be a matter of <HI>cordial</HI> and <HI>deliberate choice.</HI> <Q>Chu&s;e ye this day whom ye will &s;erve. I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of GOD, that you pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable to GOD, which is your rea&s;onable &s;er|vice.</Q> &mdash;GOD will have <HI>our heart;</HI> the approbation of our rea&s;on and the free and chearful con&s;ent of our mind in this matter,&mdash;that it may not be a <HI>con&s;trained,</HI> but a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> &s;ervice.

<P N="11">11.

<HEAD>ESSAY VI. <HI>The</HI> NATURE, DESIGN, <HI>and</HI> USE <HI>of the</HI> LORD'S SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SACRAMENTS are &s;olemn ordinances in&s;ti|tuted by Chri&s;t, <HI>repre&s;enting, &s;ealing</HI> and <HI>applying</HI> Chri&s;t, and his purcha&s;ed benefits to the &s;ouls of belie|vers.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE are <HI>two</HI> &s;uch in the New Te&s;tament, <HI>viz. bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's &s;upper,</HI> an&s;wering to <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;cal lamb</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. THESE &s;acraments are in&s;titutions of a po&s;itive, and not of a moral nature; deriving all their worth from the authority which enjoins them, and as binding upon us as any moral duties whatever.</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE go&s;pel &s;acraments are not burthen&s;ome, expen&s;ive and laborious; but cheap and ea&s;y, and yet of u&s;eful &s;ignificancy.</P>
<P N="5">5. BAPTISM fitly repre&s;ents our need of being <HI>wa&s;hed by the blood,</HI> and <HI>&s;anctified by the Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t, which are both emblematically &s;et forth by the clean&s;ing, purify|ing nature of the element of water made u&s;e of in that ordinance; and it is to be <HI>but once</HI> admini&s;tred as an <HI>ini|tiatory ordinance,</HI> on our fir&s;t entering into the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. AS, in bapti&s;m, we take upon us the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;ubmit to the whole religion of Chri&s;t, we do virtually oblige our&s;elves in this ordinance, to re|ceive the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE Lord's &s;upper obliges us to the &s;ame duties as bapti&s;m, and no more, nor any other: Both are <HI>&s;igns</HI> and <HI>&s;eals</HI> of <HI>the &s;ame covenant.</HI> The &s;pecific difference &s;eems to lie here: Bapti&s;m is but <HI>once</HI> admini&s;tred as an
<PB N="67" REF="014137_0066_0F97D489823DE210">initiatory ordinance;&mdash;the Lord's &s;upper often, as a &s;trengthening and nouri&s;hing ordinance: Bapti&s;m has a more &s;pecial reference to the <HI>religion of Chri&s;t:</HI>&mdash;The Lord's &s;upper, to CHRIST, the author and founder of it. How fal&s;ely then do many baptized Chri&s;tians imagine them&s;elves under <HI>fewer obligations</HI> to holine&s;s, than <HI>com|municants?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <Q>THE Lord's &s;upper is a &s;acrament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine, according to Chri&s;t's appointment, his death is &s;hewed forth; and the worthy receivers are (not after a corporal and car|nal manner, but by faith) made partakers of his body and blood, with all his benefits, to their &s;piritual nouri&s;hment and growth in grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the A&s;&s;embly's &s;horter Catechi&s;m.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. THIS &s;acrament is enjoined on all Chri&s;tians, as a pledge of their duty, obedience and allegiance to Chri&s;t, the glorious captain of &s;alvation; and to keep up in their hearts a grateful remembrance of his dying love.</P>
<P N="10">10. IT was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, ju&s;t before his death, after he had eat his la&s;t pa&s;&s;over; is enjoined upon his followers by his dying command, and is to be continu|ed by them to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE <HI>&s;pecific nature</HI> and <HI>proper notion</HI> of this ordi|nance, is, <Q>A memorial of Chri&s;t's &s;acrifice; or a keep|ing up the fre&s;h remembrance of his death in the church, together with the cau&s;e, de&s;ign and benefits of it; all which benefits are &s;ealed and applied to be|lievers in receiving it:</Q> <HI>This do in</HI> REMEMBRANCE <HI>of me, and as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do</HI> SHEW FORTH <HI>the Lord's death,</HI> 'TILL HE COME<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23,&mdash;29.

<P N="13">13.

It naturally re|minds us of the evil and accur&s;ed nature of &s;in, which needed &s;uch an expen&s;ive &s;acrifice.&mdash;(2.) Of the incom|prehen&s;ible love of GOD, who furni&s;hed &s;uch a &s;acrifice for the expiation of human guilt.&mdash;(3.) As tho&s;e who <HI>fea&s;ted upon a &s;acrifice,</HI> were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a &s;tate of fa|vour with the Deity to whom the &s;acrifice had been of|fered, and to be in perfect friend&s;hip one with another; &s;o thus fea&s;ting on the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, denotes our fel|low&s;hip and communion with the Father and the Son, and that we are united together in the &s;tricte&s;t bonds of Chri&s;tian charity and love.&mdash;(4.) This &s;acrament being a <HI>fea&s;t upon a &s;acrifice,</HI> we ought to con&s;ider it as a proper form of renewing covenant with GOD, and a &s;ign and means of our participating in the ble&s;&s;ings of this cove|nant. &mdash;(5.) This &s;acrament repre&s;ents the death of Chri&s;t as that of a conqueror, who conquered in dying, and who, by his re&s;urrection, has &s;ecured victory for all his followers.&mdash;(6.) His death, as repre&s;ented in this &s;acrament, &s;hould be con&s;idered as the ground of his ex|altation, and of that exten&s;ive dominion and power which he now holds in the heavenly world, for the good of his church:&mdash;And, (7.) While we here contemplate
<PB N="69" REF="014137_0068_0F97D48AF4A2B370">his death, our thoughts &s;hould &s;pring upward to his glo|rified &s;tate, and forward, to his &s;econd, triumphant ap|pearance, when we &s;hall have rea&s;on to glory in a once crucified ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE chief <HI>u&s;e</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of this &s;acrament, is to <HI>perpetuate,</HI> and, as it were, to <HI>eternize</HI> the memory of the love of GOD and of Chri&s;t to us; to actuate, enkindle and enflame our love and gratitude to them; to bring frequently into our remembrance the mo&s;t powerful motives to univer&s;al holine&s;s, and to unite the hearts of Chri&s;tians in the firme&s;t and mo&s;t endearing bonds of love.</P>
<P N="15">15. NONE &s;eem to have a right to this ordinance, in the &s;ight of GOD, but the <HI>true di&s;ciples of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. NONE have a right to it, in the &s;ight of men, but &s;uch as appear, in a judgment of charity, to be <HI>real Chri|&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. NONE therefore &s;hould be admitted to it, with|out a due, previous examination of their Chri&s;tian know|ledge, and &s;ome evidence of their &s;incerity in religion.</P>
<P N="18">18. THOSE who have been admitted upon mi&s;taken notions of their &s;incerity, may be again excluded, when the church receives proof of &s;uch mi&s;takes.</P>

<P N="4">4.

<P N="15">15.

<P N="16">16.

<P N="5">5. IT becomes us immediately after this ordinance, to renew our holy re&s;olutions, and to call up all our vi|gilance, for the two following rea&s;ons: (1.) <HI>Satan</HI> is pecu|liarly bu&s;y, after &s;ealing ordinances, in endeavouring to rob us of the comforts of religion; to undo what was done at the ordinance; and either to cajole us into <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> or to drive us into <HI>de&s;pair;</HI> and, generally &s;peaking, the greater &s;en&s;ible comfort we have had in the ordinance, the greater danger &s;hall we be in of falling into <HI>&s;piritual pride</HI> or <HI>fatal &s;ecurity</HI> after it. It has been al&s;o ob&s;erved, that men are liable to fall into the heavie&s;t temptations immediately after &s;acraments. <HI>Satan's</HI> mo&s;t violent a&s;|&s;aults upon our Saviour, happened immediately after his bapti&s;m, the vi&s;ible de&s;cent of the holy Gho&s;t upon him, and that &s;ignal honour done him, by a voice <HI>from the excellent glory</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 21, 22.&mdash;iv. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and it was on the back of his fir&s;t &s;acrament, and after the mo&s;t confident and &s;anguine re&s;olutions of <HI>Peter,</HI> that he was tempted to deny his Lord and Ma&s;ter, and &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly yielded to the temptation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 29,&mdash;71.</NOTE>. (2.) It becomes us to renew and &s;trengthen our re&s;olutions, that our Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="77" REF="014137_0076_0F97D491B71C98C8">may be adorned, and that Chri&s;tianity may not &s;uffer by our follies and indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P N="6">6. THESE good re&s;olutions &s;hould be formed <HI>wholly</HI> and <HI>only</HI> in the &s;trength of Chri&s;t; and indeed, <HI>this it&s;elf</HI> ought to be one of our mo&s;t &s;olemn re&s;olutions, that we will <HI>live wholly by faith on the Son of</HI> GOD. This is that all-important doctrine of humility and &s;elf-denial which is inculcated upon us, throughout the whole go&s;pel, and which is indeed the very <HI>&s;pirit and genius</HI> of the go&s;pel it|&s;elf, that, renouncing all &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;elf-de|pendance, we are to rely wholly on the righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength of the Redeemer; going forth to perform all duty, and to encounter all temptation, only in his &s;trength and in the power of his might; ca&s;ting all our cares upon him who careth for us, and de&s;iring to be found only in him, clothed with his righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P N="5">5. THIS is a <HI>&s;piritual union.</HI> <Q>They that are joined to the Lord, are one &s;pirit;</Q> and this is true in two important &s;en&s;es: (1.) They partake of the &s;ame di|vine Spirit with their Lord and Ma&s;ter. To <HI>him</HI> indeed GOD gives not the Spirit by mea&s;ure. In him it hath plea&s;ed the Father that all fullne&s;s of the Spirit and his graces &s;hould dwell; and, through this union, believers derive from him &s;uch &s;upplies of this Spirit, and his graces, as they &s;tand in need of. It is the very &s;ame Spirit which dwelleth in Chri&s;t, as the head, which is di&s;pen&s;ed by him to the living members of his my&s;tical body. All the&s;e members, whether in heaven or on earth, drink in the &s;ame Spirit, from the &s;ame never|failing fountain or repo&s;itory, and are all united together in love by the &s;ame Spirit. (2.) They have al&s;o the <HI>&s;ame temper</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> the <HI>&s;ame mind</HI> in them which is al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. His intere&s;t is their intere&s;t; and his will is their will. They have the &s;ame aims, de&s;ires, aver&s;ions, delights; the &s;ame love of GOD, zeal for his glory, and charity and affection for his creatures and children. And hereby they know that Chri&s;t abideth in them, by the Spirit which he hath given them: But tho&s;e who have not <HI>thus</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>temper of Chri&s;t,</HI> may be a&s;&s;ured that they are none of his.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS union of the &s;oul to Chri&s;t is formed <HI>by faith.</HI> The holy Spirit works this faith in the &s;oul, and draws it to Chri&s;t; and faith receives Chri&s;t into the &s;oul, and forms the bond of &s;piritual union between them; &s;o that thenceforth the &s;oul <HI>lives in Chri&s;t,</HI> by <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>love,</HI>

<P N="7">7. THE effects of this union are many and exceeding precious: For, (1.) The moment our &s;ouls are thus united to Chri&s;t, we are in a <HI>ju&s;tified &s;tate,</HI> in a &s;tate of acceptance and reconciliation with GOD, and con&s;e|quently can never come into condemnation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE>. (2.) The moment of this union, is the moment of <HI>our &s;piri|tual regeneration:</HI> We then begin to be <HI>partakers of a di|vine nature,</HI> which, by virtue of this union, we receive from Chri&s;t the head of divine influences. (3.) With the fir&s;t moment of this union begins our <HI>eternal,</HI> as well as our <HI>&s;piritual life:</HI> It is our <HI>birth to glory.</HI> (4.) Our progre&s;s in holine&s;s depends entirely on this union; for &s;evered from Chri&s;t, we can do nothing. (5.) Fellow|&s;hip and communion with GOD is entirely the fruit and effect of this union: For, we can have no fellow&s;hip with GOD, but <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Chri&s;t. (6.) Fellow&s;hip and communion among Chri&s;tians is begun and carried on by this union: For, they are all united unto one ano|ther <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>to</HI> GOD <HI>through Chri&s;t;</HI> and this com|munion is formed by their all partaking the &s;ame Spirit from Chri&s;t the head, by which as members, they are united together into one body.</P>
<P N="8">8. LET us never re&s;t &s;atisfied, until this ble&s;&s;ed uni|on is formed in our own &s;ouls; and until we know that it is, by the ble&s;&s;ed effects of it, purifying our hearts by faith, and enabling us to bring forth much fruit of ho|line&s;s.&mdash;I had almo&s;t forgot to add, under the forego|ing particular, That the per&s;everance of the &s;aints in grace, is the ble&s;&s;ed effect of this union; and that this union, is the &s;tronge&s;t argument to prove it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIV. <HI>Of the</HI> FINAL PERSEVERANCE <HI>of the</HI> SAINTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS every ble&s;&s;ing is valuable in proportion to its <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>duration,</HI> &s;o the final per&s;eve|rance of the &s;aints in holine&s;s, if it be true, mu&s;t be a ve|ry comfortable doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS doctrine is nece&s;&s;arily denied by all tho&s;e who imagine they can put them&s;elves into a &s;tate of grace, and put them&s;elves out of it, at plea&s;ure; and in|deed by many who acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;u|pernatural and efficacious influences of the Spirit in con|ver&s;ion, and yet &s;uppo&s;e this grace <HI>ami&s;&s;ible</HI> by the con|verted &s;inner, who, by his abu&s;e of his natural liberty, may <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>finally fall from grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN we &s;peak of a &s;inner's <HI>per&s;evering in grace,</HI> or <HI>falling from grace,</HI> we mean <HI>true grace,</HI> or a real work of regenerating grace in the &s;oul: For, we make no doubt, that many who have &s;eemed to have had grace, in a judgment of charity, have fallen from that grace which they <HI>only &s;eemed to have,</HI> but <HI>had not</HI> in reality. We have ob&s;erved before, that a very &s;pecious religious cha|racter is often formed on the principles of <HI>&s;elf-love, ho|nour, fame, reputation</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> or the terrors of con&s;ci|ence, from a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of guilt and demerit, which, although it is exceeding <HI>hollow, defective</HI> and <HI>imperfect,</HI> yet often impo&s;es not only on a credulous world, but al&s;o upon the per&s;ons who &s;u&s;tain it. None but GOD certainly and infallibly knows whether per&s;ons have true grace or not. Hypocrites often make as fair a profe&s;|&s;ion as real Chri&s;tians; and when &s;uch fall into a cour&s;e of gro&s;s &s;ins, we are not ra&s;hly to conclude that <HI>men may
<PB N="96" REF="014137_0095_0F97D4E7F3900AF0">fall from grace,</HI> as it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to know whether &s;uch were ever <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>really</HI> gracious.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is no objection again&s;t this doctrine, that &s;ome truly gracious per&s;ons have fallen into very gro&s;s &s;ins; yea, into cour&s;es of &s;in, and thereby di&s;honoured Chri&s;t, and their profe&s;&s;ion of his religion. The que&s;tion is, Whether truly gracious per&s;ons can ever <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>final|ly</HI> lo&s;e the principle of grace; <HI>wholly</HI> apo&s;tatize from GOD, and fall into reprobacy and condemnation?</P>
<P N="5">5. SOME have imagined, that the &s;aints may fall <HI>total|ly</HI> from grace, but not <HI>finally;</HI> as in the in&s;tances of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon:</HI> But, though this would &s;olve many diffi|culties, yet it does not &s;eem to be the &s;cripture doc|trine.</P>
<P N="6">6. IF what we have &s;aid of <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> be true, it &s;eems by no means probable, that GOD &s;hould regenerate men, and give them his Spirit, and wholly change their na|tures, and put his image on their &s;ouls, and yet, that ei|ther <HI>they them&s;elves,</HI> or the <HI>devil,</HI> &s;hould be allowed to de|&s;troy and undo this glorious work, and wholly raze and blot out that image of his, which was engraven by his Spirit on their hearts!</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P N="8">8. IF the doctrine of our <HI>my&s;tical union with Chri&s;t,</HI> through faith and the indwelling influences of the Spi|rit,
<PB N="97" REF="014137_0096_0F97D4E8B39A9628">be true; the per&s;everance of the &s;aints in holine&s;s, mu&s;t follow of con&s;equence: For, can we &s;uppo&s;e that the my&s;tical body of Chri&s;t can be mangled or di&s;mem|bered? That his members may be cut off and made members of the devil? Or that our bodies may be one day <HI>temples of the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and the next <HI>&s;ynagogues of &s;atan?</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Is it not &s;omething very &s;hocking and ab&s;urd to rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;tates of men GOD-ward &s;hould be liable to hourly change; one hour ju&s;tified per&s;ons, the next under &s;entence of condemnation; one hour holy &s;aints, the next profane reprobates; one hour favourites of heaven, the next confederates with hell: The hour before death in a &s;tate of &s;alvation, angels ready to guard and convey them to bli&s;s; an hour hence, the prey of devils, and conveyed by them to ever|la&s;ting torments!</P>
<P N="10">10. WE do not &s;ay that the &s;aints are infallible by any power of &s;tanding in them&s;elves; or that divine grace is a thing, which, in its own nature cannot be lo&s;t. We believe, that if believers were left to them&s;elves, they would fall from grace every hour. But we found this doctrine wholly on the power and promi&s;e of GOD; firmly believing, on the authority of his infallible word, <Q>That his gifts and calling are without repentance; and that all who are begotten again to a lively hope, through the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the dead, to an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in the heavens for them, SHALL BE KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD, THROUGH FAITH, UNTO SALVATION, ready to be re|vealed in the la&s;t times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 3,&mdash;6.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P N="12">12. THE &s;cripture in&s;tances or examples alledged again&s;t this doctrine, are either, (1.) Of <HI>hypocritical pro|fe&s;&s;ors,</HI> or <HI>mere temporary believers,</HI> falling from an out|ward profe&s;&s;ion of religion, which we believe to be a ve|ry po&s;&s;ible and common ca&s;e. Or, (2.) Of the <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> and <HI>temporary</HI> defections and falls of true &s;aints, which we readily grant to be too frequent a ca&s;e. Or, (3.) Of <HI>conditional threatenings</HI> made to true &s;aints, as a means of, and excitement to their per&s;everance. And all the&s;e &s;cripture in&s;tances which are commonly objected to this doctrine, may, without &s;training them, be reduced to one or other of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE principal objections alledged again&s;t this doctrine, from the nature and tendency of it, is, (1.) That it mini&s;ters to carnal confidence and &s;ecurity, and tends to hinder that watchfulne&s;s and circum&s;pection, that holy fear and trembling with which it becomes &s;uch guilty, imperfect creatures as we are, to work out our &s;alvation: But, the very be&s;t of men, can have no ground of confidence, &s;ave in the &s;trength and promi&s;e of GOD. We know al&s;o, that if we live not holily, watchfully and circum&s;pectly, we have no true grace. The&s;e are the only certain and infallible &s;igns and marks of true grace, and where the&s;e are wanting, it would be the mo&s;t irrational and ab&s;urd pre&s;umption, to be confi|dent of per&s;evering in a grace which we have not. (2.) It is objected, that this doctrine renders admonitions and reproofs, vain and needle&s;s. But the&s;e are the very appointed means of our &s;tanding, and to prevent our
<PB N="99" REF="014137_0098_0F97D4EA3366E7B0">apo&s;tacy and ruin. We can have no certainty of per|&s;everance, but what ari&s;es from our certainty of the truth of grace, and this can be only a&s;certained by a rea|dy and chearful compliance with every go&s;pel motive to univer&s;al holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="14">14. FEW Chri&s;tians <HI>can</HI> or <HI>ought</HI> to take any comfort from the application of this doctrine to them&s;elves. None have any right to do &s;o, but &s;uch as have the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfying evidences of the truth of grace in them&s;elves. And how few real Chri&s;tians, comparative|ly &s;peaking, have actually attained to this &s;atisfying evi|dence of the truth of grace, from which they may take the comfort of the doctrine of per&s;everance?</P>
<P N="15">15. LET it therefore be our fir&s;t and principal care, to have true grace; let it be our next to know that we have it, to make our calling and election &s;ure and cer|tain to our&s;elves; and then let us freely rejoice in the immutability of the divine love;&mdash;that his gifts and calling are without repentance; that where he has once begun a good work, he will carry it on to the day of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and that neither earth nor hell, &s;hall be able to pluck us out of his hand, or out of his Father's hand.

<HEAD>ESSAY XV. <HI>Of</HI> PEACE <HI>of</HI> CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONSCIENCE is a comparing of our moral actions with their rule, and a practical judg|ing of them by this rule; the re&s;ult of which is, that we either <HI>acquit</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI> our&s;elves, according to this

<P N="3">3. IN order to true peace of con&s;cience, it is not enough that the matter of our actions be conformable to the law of GOD: We mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;cious that they are done from <HI>right motives</HI> and for <HI>right ends;</HI> in obedi|ence to the authority of GOD, with a view to his glory and the good of our fellow creatures, or for our own &s;pi|ritual benefit.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XVIII. <HI>The</HI> IMMORTALITY <HI>of the</HI> SOUL.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE doctrine of the &s;oul's immortality is of great importance in religion: For, if the &s;oul peri&s;hed with the body, <HI>&s;elf-denial, mortification,</HI> and <HI>ex|treme &s;ufferings</HI> in the cau&s;e of virtue, would be <HI>ab&s;urd;</HI>&mdash; and the be&s;t Chri&s;tians would, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ugge&s;ts, be of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY the &s;oul's being <HI>immortal,</HI> we do not mean that it is impo&s;&s;ible for him who made it to de&s;troy it; or that it is, in its own nature, immortal, independently on GOD; but that it does not peri&s;h or die with, or like the
<PB N="109" REF="014137_0108_0F97D4F273BF3528">body, nor can be de&s;troyed by any creature; but is ap|pointed by GOD for an endle&s;s exi&s;tence, and fitted and qualified for this deathle&s;s exi&s;tence in its own nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. REASON does not a&s;&s;ure us, that <HI>thought</HI> and <HI>con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> are <HI>in&s;eparable</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> properties of human &s;ouls: For ought we know, they may be and exi&s;t with|out continued thought, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and reflection, though the contrary opinion is highly probable, and &s;eems to be countenanced by &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE know of but two kinds of &s;ub&s;tances in the univer&s;e, <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> And the&s;e we conceive of as entirely different and di&s;tinct from one another. GOD, we are &s;ure, is a <HI>pure &s;pirit; immaterial, without body</HI> or <HI>bo|dily parts:</HI> But we are not equally certain that created &s;pirits, either <HI>angels</HI> or <HI>human &s;ouls,</HI> are &s;pirits of the &s;ame nature with GOD, or <HI>wholly immaterial.</HI> Though their being called <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> and being &s;aid to be made after the image of GOD, and to be <HI>his off-&s;pring,</HI> is a <HI>&s;trong pre|&s;umption</HI> that they are <HI>immaterial.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IF it could be certainly proved that our &s;ouls are wholly immaterial, as GOD is, it would be a &s;trong ar|gument in favour of their immortality: Becau&s;e, it would hence follow, that they are <HI>incapable of di&s;&s;olution;</HI> that they could not peri&s;h with the body, and that none but GOD could de&s;troy them.

In other words; it appears, that they are <HI>moral agents, accountable creatures,</HI> under law to GOD; and that they know they are re&s;pon&s;ible to him for their moral actions.

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIII. <HI>Of</HI> HELL, <HI>or the</HI> PLACE <HI>and</HI> STATE <HI>of the</HI> WICKED.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ALTHOUGH the wicked carry hell in their con&s;ciences from the moment of their death, and are probably doomed to herd among the devils, and to &s;hare in their pre&s;ent puni&s;hments; yet their ri&s;ing from their graves in <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>deformity;</HI> their ranking them&s;elves on the left hand of the judge, and more e&s;pe|cially their receiving that awful &s;entence; <Q>Depart from me ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</Q> may be reckoned the begin|ning of their <HI>hell,</HI> or <HI>eternal torments</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 41. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HELL is both a <HI>place</HI> and a <HI>&s;tate.</HI> The <HI>place</HI> or <HI>locality</HI> of hell cannot be doubted after the re&s;urrection, as the bodies of the wicked mu&s;t needs be in &s;ome place. Be|&s;ides, the &s;criptures repre&s;ent it as <Q>a lake of fire and brim&s;tone; a fire prepared for the devil and his an|gels,</Q> and the like;&mdash;and <HI>Dives</HI> is repre&s;ented as lift|ing up his eyes, being in torments; and an <HI>impa&s;&s;able gulph</HI> is &s;aid to be fixed between him and <HI>Lazarus.</HI> But whether the &s;ouls of the wicked are now, in their inter|mediate &s;tate, confined to any &s;uch place, is a que&s;tion not ea&s;y or needful to be an&s;wered. Some think, that they and the devils are &s;uffered to roam at large through the univer&s;e. Let it &s;uffice us to know, that wherever they are, it is hell with them. They are under a pain|ful &s;en&s;e of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and have a dreadful expectation of the judgment, and of greater mi&s;eries yet to come.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE have been many vain &s;peculations about the <HI>place</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of hell's torments. Some have
<PB N="126" REF="014137_0125_0F97D4FF335E11F8">thought it ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the po&s;itive torments of damned &s;pirits, of the devil and his angels, &s;hould be excited <HI>by material fire.</HI> But if we con&s;ider, that it is our <HI>&s;pirits</HI> which feel the pain of burning through our bodies, we &s;hall not think it incredible, that GOD &s;hould excite the &s;ame idea of pain from &s;ire in <HI>pure &s;pirits,</HI> without the intervention of bodies. However, fire may be only <HI>figuratively</HI> u&s;ed, to &s;ignify the mo&s;t inten&s;e pain and torments. And as for the <HI>place</HI> of the damned, it bet|ter becomes us to endeavour to &s;hun it, than curiou&s;ly to enquire <HI>where</HI> or <HI>what</HI> it is.</P>
<P N="4">4. AT the re&s;urrection of the wicked, their &s;ouls be|ing united to their bodies, they &s;hall be judged; and that awful &s;entence being pa&s;&s;ed upon them, <Q>Depart from me ye cur&s;ed, &amp;c.</Q> they &s;hall be dragged away by devils, and with them, &s;hut up in the pri&s;on of hell; thus &s;haring in the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e with whom they apo&s;tatized.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT appears from &s;cripture, that the mi&s;ery of the damned will be <HI>properly eternal, everla&s;ting fire;</HI> a <HI>worm that dieth not,</HI> and <HI>a fire that is</HI> not <HI>quenched.</HI> It appears agreeable to rea&s;on al&s;o, that creatures who have de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected <HI>an everla&s;ting heaven of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> &s;hould have <HI>an everla&s;ting hell of mi&s;ery;</HI> and that tho&s;e who have &s;lighted the glorious hope &s;et before them, &s;hould inhe|rit endle&s;s de&s;pair, which, indeed, upon the whole, was <HI>their own choice</HI> and <HI>preference.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AS to the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of <HI>hell,</HI> or rather of <HI>the damned,</HI> it a|ri&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from their own wicked and helli&s;h di&s;po&s;itions, which cannot admit of happine&s;s, but are naturally productive of mi&s;ery. A wicked man is, and mu&s;t be <HI>a hell to him&s;elf.</HI> He is <HI>&s;elf-fitted</HI> and <HI>prepared to this de&s;truction;</HI> and he needs only to be out of the body, and out of a capacity of ta&s;ting GOD'S goodne&s;s, to be in <HI>hell,</HI> and to be equally a <HI>devil.</HI> So that repentance of &s;in, and
<PB N="127" REF="014137_0126_0F97D5010E2C0D40">holine&s;s, are in their own nature, nece&s;&s;ary to deliver men from hell, and to qualify them for happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE chief ingredients in the mi&s;eries of the dam|ned, are, (1.) Their being bani&s;hed from the pre&s;ence and enjoyment of GOD, the fountain of happine&s;s:&mdash; (2.) The &s;ociety of <HI>devils</HI> and other damned &s;pirits, who will be continually upbraiding them, and exciting their helli&s;h pa&s;&s;ions:&mdash;(3.) A remembrance of the good things of this life which they have lo&s;t, and a &s;en&s;e of their de&s;perate madne&s;s in rejecting that eternal ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s which they might have enjoyed, for the meere&s;t trifles:&mdash;(4.) Envy at the happine&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed:&mdash; (5.) A painful &s;en&s;e of GOD'S wrath, and the infliction of po&s;itive torments from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power;&mdash;and <HI>finally,</HI> de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing an end of their mi&s;ery&mdash;with, perhaps&mdash;a conti|nual increa&s;e and aggravation of it, from their increa&s;ing wickedne&s;s and guilt.</P>

The following may &s;erve as a few illu&s;trations of this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="1">1. OTHERS, even <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>&s;inners may</HI> and <HI>do</HI> love tho&s;e that love them: But we mu&s;t love and wi&s;h well to our enemies; pray for them and do them good.</P>

<P N="3">3. OTHERS will <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> mind religion when they have nothing el&s;e to do, either for their worldly plea|&s;ure or profit: But we mu&s;t make religion the <HI>principal leading</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives, to which all things mu&s;t give way.</P>
<P N="4">4. OTHERS perform the duties of religion, as a <HI>di&s;agreeable ta&s;k,</HI> either to &s;tand fair in the opini|on of men, or to &s;atisfy the importunate demands of con&s;cience: But we mu&s;t <HI>delight</HI> and <HI>rejoice</HI> in them, as our mo&s;t &s;weet and plea&s;urable enjoyments.</P>

<P N="3">3. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS will principally &s;hew it|&s;elf in the following in&s;tances:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IN a &s;upreme regard to GOD above the crea|ture. The heavenly-minded man loves GOD and the Saviour, although un&s;een, above all things in this world, by means of that faith which is the evidence of things not &s;een, and the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for. No object of &s;ight or &s;en&s;e &s;o &s;trongly moves the noble&s;t affections of his &s;oul, or &s;o powerfully elicites and draws forth his defires, as an invi&s;ible GOD, and an exalted Redeemer, whom having not &s;een, he loves, and in whom, although now he &s;ees them not, he yet rejoices with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 8.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">(2.) THE heavenly-minded man &s;ees and enjoys GOD in his <HI>works</HI> and <HI>providences.</HI> His mind is turned to a contemplation of GOD in his va&s;t and wonderful works. In the&s;e he has a deep and affecting conviction of the power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of him who made them all. He ta&s;tes the goodne&s;s of GOD in every en|joyment of &s;en&s;e; in every plea&s;ure and refre&s;hment. He eyes and enjoys GOD in every di&s;pen&s;ation of pro|vidence. He receives every mercy as the gift of GOD, and a fre&s;h obligation to gratitude, love and prai&s;e; and hears the voice of GOD in every affliction, reprov|ing, cha&s;tening and calling him home from &s;in, or quickening him to the performance of &s;ome long-ne|glected duty.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE heavenly-minded man, conver&s;es with, and enjoys GOD, in his <HI>word</HI> and <HI>ordinances.</HI> He reads the &s;criptures diligently, with corre&s;pondent holy affections; with gratitude and &s;piritual de&s;ire and appetite. He hears GOD &s;peaking to his &s;oul in them; trembles at his word; delights in the purity of his laws, humbly &s;ubmits to their authority, and feeds plea&s;urably upon his promi&s;es and offers of mercy. He frequents ordi|nances, with no other view than to <HI>glorify</HI> and <HI>enjoy</HI> GOD in them. In <HI>prayer,</HI> he really, humbly and delightfully conver&s;es with GOD. In <HI>prai&s;e</HI> his &s;oul exalts and mag|nifies the Almighty. He hears &s;ermons that he may
<PB N="133" REF="014137_0132_0F97D5053363C300">the better know GOD, and his duty, and love them; and that he may, by this means, clean&s;e his way, re|form his life, and get &s;trength for both.

<PB N="134" REF="014137_0133_0F97D505F36A1818">if he &s;uffers a little in his journey, he cares not much for it.

And indeed, the more eager|ly that the eye of his faith and hope is fixed upon the heavenly prize, <HI>i. e.</HI> the more heavenly-minded he is, the le&s;s will he regard or mind the things that are around him, or the cro&s;s accidents that happen to him on his journey thither. Hence it follows; that he walks by <HI>faith,</HI> not by <HI>&s;ight;</HI> looketh not on the things that are &s;een and temporal, but at the things which are un&s;een and eternal;&mdash;&s;etteth his affection on things above, and not on things below.

2. GOSPEL &s;incerity &s;uppo&s;es a &s;ingle aim and inten|tion of plea&s;ing GOD, in the whole of our cour&s;e.

<P N="2">2. EVEN religious zeal is not &s;o much a Chri&s;tian grace or virtue, as a qualification which &s;hould attend the exerci&s;e of every Chri&s;tian grace and virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;criptures give as many in&s;tances of a <HI>bad</HI> zeal as of a <HI>good</HI> one: We cannot therefore be too cautious about what objects our zeal is employed, and in what degree, le&s;t, while we imagine we are plea&s;ing and ho|nouring GOD, we may in fact be di&s;honouring and of|fending him, and increa&s;ing our own guilt.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Chri&s;tian zeal is, however, a very important and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, and as we are expre&s;sly com|manded to <HI>be zealous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 10.</NOTE>, it may be right to enquire into the properties of a true Chri&s;tian zeal; to con&s;ider its &s;pecious and impo&s;ing counterfeits, to &s;peak of the obli|gations we are under to be zealous, and of that temper which is contrary to it; and by doing this we &s;hall ex|hau&s;t the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) EVEN a religious zeal is no farther good and commendable, than when it is on the &s;ide of truth and virtue. The <HI>cau&s;e</HI> therefore mu&s;t be <HI>good</HI> about which our zeal is concerned, or it will have the mo&s;t mi&s;chiev|ous con&s;equences. To be zealous, that is, to have a
<PB N="141" REF="014137_0140_0F97D50BF3A9A988">&s;trong and ardent concern, for fal&s;ehood, and again&s;t truth; or for vice and again&s;t virtue, and to act vigo|rou&s;ly in con&s;equence of this zeal, is to do the very greate&s;t mi&s;chief in our power, and to act the <HI>devil,</HI> as much as our capacities and influence will admit. Such was the zeal of the Jews again&s;t Chri&s;t, his Apo&s;tles, and the primitive Chri&s;tians. Such, particularly, was the zeal of <HI>Saul,</HI> afterwards <HI>Paul,</HI> when he <HI>madly,</HI> and with uncommon ardor and activity per&s;ecuted the church of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 17, 18.&mdash;xiii. 45.&mdash;xvii. 5. Rom. x. 2. Gal. i. 14. Phil. iii. 6.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">(2.) IGNORANCE of truth and duty, where there is a po&s;&s;ibility and opportunity of coming to the knowledge of them, will not excu&s;e in this matter, otherwi&s;e it would have excu&s;ed St. <HI>Paul</HI> and mo&s;t of the <HI>Jews</HI> in their mi&s;guided and mi&s;chievous zeal. Therefore, our zeal, e&s;pecially our religious zeal, &s;hould always be preceded by a careful, &s;erious enquiry into the truth, and accompanied with knowledge. The rea&s;on of this is plain; for, of all zeal, religious zeal where it is blind and mi&s;guided is the mo&s;t furious and mi&s;chievous. It is increa&s;ed by the importance of its object; and when it is blind and mi&s;guided, it rages again&s;t the cau&s;e and glory of GOD, and the highe&s;t concerns of men, which are truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. We may &s;ee its dreadful effects in the primitive <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>heathen</HI> per&s;ecutions, and in the &s;eas of Prote&s;tant blood &s;pilt by the church of Rome. If the <HI>Jews</HI> had known Chri&s;t, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; yet &s;ince they <HI>might</HI> have known him, their ignorance was no excu&s;e for their zeal again&s;t him.

<P N="3">(3.) RIGHT and good zeal, mu&s;t be proportioned to the value and importance of the objects about which it is employed. As there is diver&s;ity in the importance even of the&s;e things which are of divine duty and obli|gation, &s;o we &s;hould be mo&s;t zealous about the mo&s;t im|portant things and duties of religion, and proportionably le&s;s zealous about tho&s;e things and duties which are of le&s;s importance. It is the way of hypocrites to be mighty zealous about tri&s;les; about &s;mall matters, and ceremonial ob&s;ervances, while they are very luke|warm and indifferent, about the greater duties of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI> They tithe <HI>mint, ani&s;e</HI> and <HI>cummin;</HI> while they neglect the weightier matters of the law, <HI>mercy, judgment</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiii. 23, 24.</NOTE>. How prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd is it to &s;ee a man break charity with his Chri&s;tian bro|ther, for the neglect of <HI>modes, ceremonies,</HI> and <HI>human in|ventions,</HI> while he would care&s;s him, though a drunkard, an adulterer, or a profane &s;wearer, if he ob&s;erved the&s;e? Rea&s;on will teach us, that duties of the highe&s;t impor|tance, &s;hould be the mo&s;t ardently cared for, and the mo&s;t diligently performed. We would deem him a fool, who would be more concerned about the &s;ecurity and welfare of his finger or toe, than of his heart or brain. Every thing appertaining to true religion merits our regard and ob&s;ervance; but the vitals of religion merit our warme&s;t zeal. <Q>GOD loveth mercy more than &s;acrifice, and righteou&s;ne&s;s more than all burnt offer|ings.</Q></P>

<P N="8">8. IMPATIENCE under afflictions, or in the delay of expected good, can be of no manner of &s;ervice to us, but mu&s;t do us a great deal of hurt. Our fretting and murmuring under afflictions, di&s;compo&s;e us, and make their weight <HI>double.</HI> It &s;hews a rebellious temper, and renders us unworthy of the relief which we de&s;ire; while, at the &s;ame time, it cannot procure us any relief, but mu&s;t needs make our ca&s;e wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9. WE de&s;erve no good thing at the hand of GOD, but all evil, even <HI>eternal mi&s;ery;</HI> and therefore, if we <HI>think right,</HI> a living man has no right to complain, a man for the puni&s;hment of his &s;ins; but it is his evident duty to bear the indignation of the Lord, becau&s;e he hath &s;inned again&s;t him.

<P N="10">10.

<P N="5">5. MEEKNESS, as it is a right temper of mind and &s;pirit towards our neighbour, con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;weet and ea|&s;y, courteous and obliging, peaceable and compo&s;ed temper and behaviour, and is oppo&s;ed to a boi&s;terous, unruly, moro&s;e, revengeful, and more e&s;pecially to a &s;urly and angry temper and conduct towards others.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE meek per&s;on is calm under provocations, and, having a command over his own &s;pirit, is not hur|ried on to cur&s;ing, railing, reproachful language, or to ha&s;ty re&s;entment and revenge, which always drives peo|ple of furious, ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;inful, and often to very unju&s;t and injurious extremes. The meek man will never be angry without a cau&s;e, or above mea|&s;ure; will never take an affront where none is meant, nor re&s;ent a real affront above what it de&s;erves. He is &s;low to wrath; not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no evil; &s;peaketh not unadvi&s;edly with his lips; rendereth not railing for railing; but, by &s;oft and rea&s;onable an&s;wers, turneth away wrath, and overcometh evil with good. Anger re&s;teth in the bo&s;om of fools: But it is not &s;o

If his brother &s;in again&s;t him <HI>&s;eventy-&s;even</HI> times in a day, and &s;ay, <HI>I repent,</HI> he forgiveth him, and ea&s;ily maketh up any breach, upon proper acknow|ledgment and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Peace</HI> is his <HI>element,</HI> and wrath the aver&s;ion of his nature.</P>
<P N="7">7. MEEKNESS di&s;covers it&s;elf, in a great cautiou&s;ne&s;s of giving offence to others. Proud, angry, wrathful and turbulent men, are not cautious of this: They are perpetually giving offence, and &s;eem to delight and glo|ry in it, as a &s;ign of courage. But the go&s;pel teacheth us to &s;peak evil, (unnece&s;&s;arily) of no man; not to be brawlers, but gentle, kind, tender-hearted, thus &s;hew|ing all meekne&s;s to all men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 2.</NOTE>. The meek man is ever a civil, affable, courteous man; and a good heart teaches him that which is the grand precept in <HI>politene&s;s</HI> and <HI>true good breeding;</HI> namely, to give no oftence or unea&s;ine&s;s to any in company; but to endeavour to give plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction to all, &s;o far as that may be done with a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="8">8. MEEKNESS will &s;hew it&s;elf in a mode&s;t and be|coming deportment in every different rank, &s;tation and relation of life. It will make <HI>&s;ervants, children,</HI> and all <HI>inferiors</HI> contented and plea&s;ed with their low and in|ferior &s;tations; the poor with their poverty, and the afflicted with their afflictions. And it will make &s;u|periors humble in their exalted &s;tations, affable, and courteous, ju&s;t and merciful, mild and gentle to tho&s;e that are under them, in inferior &s;tates.</P>
<P N="6">6. ABOVE all, a meek temper will &s;hew it&s;elf in things that relate to religion. Surely the wrath of man worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD.

<P N="12">12. MEEKNESS is a grace exceedingly ornamental to the Chri&s;tian character.

CHARITY is but another word for <HI>love;</HI> and when it is u&s;ed as a term in divinity, in its large&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, it &s;ignifies the whole of our duty to GOD and man, both in its principle and proper fruits and effects. In a word, charity is the ful|filling of the whole law, and includes the two great commandments laid down by our Saviour as the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the law and the prophets. <Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, with all thy &s;oul, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</Q> Charity, therefore, in this large&s;t &s;en&s;e, implies a right temper of mind, both to GOD and our <HI>neighbour,</HI> and all its genuine fruits and effects, and therefore, is the whole of true religion and morality.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS grace or virtue, as it re&s;pects GOD, (1.) pre&s;uppo&s;es a right knowledge of GOD; that we know him, or have worthy and ju&s;t conceptions of him in his adorable and amiable perfections (for there is not a more certain maxim, than that we can have no love for an unknown object;) and this knowledge, though it may be obtained in part, and in &s;ome degree, from his works and providences, yet it is mo&s;t perfectly obtained from his revealed word, illu&s;trated and &s;et home upon the &s;oul by the influences of his Spirit. (2.) It implies that we love him <HI>&s;upremely,</HI> and above all other beings; for if we do not love him <HI>thus,</HI> we do not love him as GOD; or the affection does not corre&s;pond with the
<PB N="155" REF="014137_0154_0F97D5178D18C498">object of it. (3.) It implies that we are cheerfully and cordially devoted to his &s;ervice and obedience: <Q>for this is the love of GOD, that we keep his command|ments.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3 THE vices oppo&s;ite to this branch of charity&mdash; are, (1.) A wilful and carele&s;s ignorance of GOD; a neglecting the means of knowing him and acquainting our&s;elves with him, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould love him as we ought. (2.) An exce&s;&s;ive <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> or love of any creature, or creature enjoyment, by which the &s;upreme love and affection of the &s;oul is &s;tolen away from GOD, and placed on the creature; which is <HI>&s;piri|tual idolatry.</HI> (3.) All &s;in and vice is a violation of this branch of charity; but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ins, which &s;trike mo&s;t directly at the <HI>glory of</HI> GOD, &s;uch as <HI>bla&s;phemy, pro|fane &s;wearing, athei&s;tical</HI> thoughts and &s;peeches, &s;peaking irreverently and &s;lighting of GOD, his works, word, or|dinances, laws, and people. Indeed, the natural mind is enmity again&s;t GOD, and none but &s;uch as are born of him, can truly love him.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;econd grand branch of charity, and as e&s;&s;en|tial as the former, is <HI>love to our neighbour.</HI> And this may be divided into two branches, <HI>humanity</HI> and Chri&s;|tian <HI>charity.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. EVERY man, in &s;cripture account, is <HI>our neigh|bour,</HI> be of what <HI>nation,</HI> or <HI>religion</HI> he will, and we owe <HI>love</HI> or <HI>charity</HI> to every man as &s;uch; as our fellow-crea|tures; a partaker with us in the &s;ame common nature; as &s;prung from the &s;ame original &s;tock, a creature of the &s;ame GOD, an inhabitant with us of the &s;ame world; &s;ubject to the &s;ame feelings, pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, wants, nece&s;&s;ities, mi&s;eries with our&s;elves, and bound with us to the &s;ame eternal world. From which relations naturally flow the duties of ju&s;tice, &s;ympathy, mercy, compa&s;&s;ion, all &s;pringing from the root of charity or love to our neighbour. Hence we are to <HI>owe no man
<PB N="156" REF="014137_0155_0F97D517F33B72B0">any thing but love;</HI> and <HI>this love</HI> is the <HI>fulfilling of the whole law,</HI> as far as it re&s;pects our neighbour; becau&s;e it will naturally and powerfully di&s;po&s;e us to treat our neigh|bour in all re&s;pects <HI>as we ought,</HI> wherever it truly takes place, and prevails in the heart.</P>
<P N="6">6. CONTRARY to this branch of <HI>charity</HI> or <HI>humanity,</HI> is all inju&s;tice, evil-&s;peaking, evil-thinking, or ra&s;h and cen&s;orious judging of our neighbour; all narrow, nati|onal prejudices again&s;t men; all local, contracted affec|tions which &s;hut out a party of mankind from our hu|manity, on account of their being of a different nation or religion from our&s;elves; all envy, malice, and cruel|ty towards our fellow-creatures, and all partiality in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="7">7. CHRISTIAN <HI>charity</HI> or <HI>love,</HI> properly &s;o called, con|&s;i&s;ts in a peculiar affection for our fellow Chri&s;tians, under the notion of their being <HI>our brethren;</HI> di&s;ciples of the &s;ame LORD and Ma&s;ter; &s;piritual children of the &s;ame GOD by adoption and regeneration; heirs of the &s;ame precious hope, and incorruptible inheritance; fel|low-pilgrims in the &s;ame &s;trange country, and fellow-travellers together to the &s;ame land of promi&s;e. This is &s;till an advance upon humanity, and unites Chri&s;tians together in the mo&s;t peculiar bonds; &s;o that whatever is a violation of the laws and bonds of common <HI>humani|ty,</HI> is much more &s;o of the laws of <HI>Chri&s;tian charity.</HI> In|deed, charity, or Chri&s;tian love, is the peculiar genius of chri&s;tianity, and is that grace which Chri&s;t has honour|ed, by making it the peculiar and di&s;tinctive badge of his di&s;ciples. <Q>By this, &s;ays Chri&s;t, &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if you have love one for another.</Q> Nor is the exerci&s;e of any grace &s;o warm|ly urged upon Chri&s;tians, as this.</P>
<P N="8">8. A PECULIAR fruit of charity is <HI>alms-giving,</HI> or re|lieving the nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>poor,</HI> the <HI>needy,</HI> the <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> and the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed;</HI> and indeed, this is what commonly
<PB N="157" REF="014137_0156_0F97D518B4D69898">pa&s;&s;es in the world by the name of <HI>charity,</HI> though very unju&s;tly: For, the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that a man may <HI>give</HI> even <HI>all his goods to feed the poor,</HI> and yet <HI>have no cha|rity.</HI> An alms, if it proceeds not from <HI>charity,</HI> that is, from a true Chri&s;tian love to GOD and our neighbour, and from a principle of dutiful obedience to GOD, is no grace at all.</P>
<P N="9">9. WE have an excellent character and de&s;cription of charity given, 1 Cor. xiii. 4, &amp;c. <Q>Charity &s;uffer|eth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; &s;eeketh not her own; is not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniqui|ty, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things; believeth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things: Charity never faileth. And now abideth faith, hope and charity, the&s;e three; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is charity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXI. CONTENTMENT, <HI>and the oppo&s;ite</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONTENTMENT is a grace which re|&s;pects only our <HI>outward condition in this world,</HI> and not our &s;piritual condition here, or our lot and ap|pointment in the world to come; and it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a moderate value for, and attachment to the things and enjoyments of the body and of this mortal life, that whether we have or want them; whether we have little or much of them, we are &s;o well &s;atisfied, and &s;o little di&s;turbed, that we are thankful to GOD for what we
<PB N="158" REF="014137_0157_0F97D5197345BF68">have, and are at <HI>lei&s;ure</HI> to enjoy both GOD and <HI>our&s;elves.</HI> In &s;hort, it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to GOD, and &s;a|tisfiedne&s;s with the allotments of his providence, with regard to our worldly circum&s;tances, that we may be able to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <Q>I have learned in what|&s;oever &s;tate I am, therewith to be contented; both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound, and be aba&s;ed and &s;uffer need<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. CONTENTMENT cannot reach to a man's &s;piritual condition or future &s;tate; for, although a &s;inner may have rea&s;on to thank GOD that he is out of <HI>hell;</HI> yet, it would ill become him to &s;ay, <Q>Whatever &s;tate my &s;oul is in, whether in a &s;tate of grace or &s;in, converted or unconverted, I am therewith contented.</Q> The de&s;ign of GOD'S word is, that &s;inners &s;hould have no peace or contentment in their &s;inful and peri&s;hing condition, and that they &s;hould never re&s;t contented, till their peace is made with GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. NOR would it become a gracious man to be con|tented with low attainments in grace and holine&s;s, and an imperfect mea&s;ure of conformity to GOD. Saints &s;hould be re&s;tle&s;s in their endeavours to <HI>perfect holine&s;s in the fear of</HI> GOD; and forgetting things behind, to reach forward, and pre&s;s on to the mark for the prize of their high calling. Phil. iii. 13, 14, and many other &s;crip|tures.</P>
<P N="4">4. NOR is it at all to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any human creature <HI>could,</HI> or <HI>&s;hould</HI> be contented to be demned, and thru&s;t out for ever from the beatific pre&s;ence of GOD. All &s;inners, indeed, ought to acknowledge damnation their ju&s;t portion, and approve the law and &s;entence which condemns them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. li. 4. Rom. iii. 4.</NOTE>: But it is again&s;t the <HI>law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation;</HI> yea, again&s;t our duty to GOD, to con|&s;ent to be damned, or to be contented with this allot|ment.
<PB N="159" REF="014137_0158_0F97D51A356BC418">That &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion, therefore, of St. Paul, Rom. ix. 3. and that of Mo&s;es, Exod. xxxii. 32, mu&s;t have &s;ome other meaning.</P>
<P N="5">5. NOR ought we to be <HI>&s;o contented</HI> with our condi|tion and circum&s;tances in this life, as to be willing to take up our lot, portion and everla&s;ting abode here. Chri&s;tian contentment is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;hes and de&s;ires to be in a better country, even an heavenly; to be <HI>ab&s;ent from the body,</HI> and the things and enjoyments of it, and <HI>pre&s;ent with the Lord;</HI> and only &s;uppo&s;es, that as wi&s;e and prudent travellers, we are contented with &s;uch lodgings and fare as we meet with in our journey to our Father's hou&s;e, and our heavenly inheritance.</P>
<P N="6">6. NOR does contentment, even with our worldly cir|cum&s;tances, imply an in&s;en&s;ibility of our difficulties and afflictions, or forbid lawful de&s;ires and endeavours to get rid of them by bettering our condition. Such de|&s;ires are the foundation of diligence, indu&s;try, and the u&s;e of means, and therefore cannot be di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD. But, contentment &s;uppo&s;es, that if we are di&s;|appointed in the u&s;e of means, we acquie&s;ce and are &s;a|tisfied, without murmuring, convinced that &s;uch is the will of heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. CONTENTMENT is oppo&s;ed to <HI>covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>worldly-mindedne&s;s,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;es that our de&s;ires of the good things of this world are low, mode&s;t and chri&s;ti|an; that we &s;eek not eagerly great things for our&s;elves, but bound our wi&s;hes and views to a moderate compe|tency; re&s;olving, that having food and raiment we will be therewith contented; &s;eeing that a man's life con&s;i&s;t|eth not in the abundance of the things he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 15. Gen. xxviii. 20. Heb. xiii. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IMMODERATE worldly cares and anxieties about what <HI>may</HI> happen to us in time to come, are incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian contentment, as they render men unea&s;y
<PB N="160" REF="014137_0159_0F97D51AF3047490">for the pre&s;ent, unfit them for the duties of religion, and &s;peak a di&s;tru&s;t of the providential goodne&s;s of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 34. Matth. vi. 34. Phil. iv. 6.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, the&s;e cares and anxieties, although they de&s;troy our peace, yet they cannot better our circum&s;tances; for, <HI>taking thought,</HI> cannot add one cubit to our &s;tature, or alter the cour&s;e or allotments of divine providence.</P>
<P N="9">9. ALL murmurings and repinings again&s;t the provi|dence of GOD, as though GOD had dealt more &s;everely with us than he ought or might have done, are in|con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian contentment. To remedy this, we &s;hould con&s;ider GOD'S univer&s;al providence, and the equity and perfect rectitude of his ways, 1 Sam. iii. 18.</P>
<P N="10">10. ENVY again&s;t others, who are in more pro&s;perous and honourable circum&s;tances than we, is incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian contentment. There can be no content|ment in the envious brea&s;t. Why &s;hould my eye be evil again&s;t my neighbour, becau&s;e GOD is good to him? If my neighbour is a wicked man, his pro&s;perity will de&s;troy him: If a good man, why &s;hould I envy his pro&s;perity, and not rather rejoice in it; &s;eeing GOD made him pro&s;perous for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es? In|deed, my envying my neighbour his pro&s;perity or hap|pine&s;s, is a plain and convincing proof, that I my&s;elf do not de&s;erve the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings at the hand of GOD; and that if I had them, I would make a very bad u&s;e of them.</P>
<P N="11">11. A TRULY contented man, however he may wi&s;h his condition better, yet never will u&s;e <HI>unlawful means</HI> to better it. This is to make ha&s;te the wrong way, to be rich, ea&s;y or happy; and &s;hews great di&s;content. The danger of this is well painted, in one in&s;tance of it, 1 Tim. vi. 8,&mdash;10. See a good advice al&s;o again&s;t this kind of di&s;content, Luke iii. 14.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="161" REF="014137_0160_0F97D51BB3241638">
12 CONTENTMENT will engage us to make the be&s;t of our condition whatever it be. The contented man will &s;urvey his remaining comforts with gratitude to GOD, and comfort him&s;elf by con&s;idering how &s;ew and tolerable his di&s;tre&s;&s;es and misfortunes are, compar|ed with tho&s;e of many others. He will al&s;o endeavour to extract &s;ome &s;piritual advantage out of every afflic|tion.</P>
<P>To engage us to contentment with our pre&s;ent lots and conditions, let us con&s;ider, (1.) That they are ap|pointed by a GOD of infinite ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom and mercy. (2.) That let them be as bad as they will, we de&s;erve &s;till wor&s;e. (3.) That it is generally <HI>our own fault,</HI> that they are not better. (4.) That if we are indeed GOD'S children, all will work together for good to us; and that our wants and afflictions are ordered <HI>in mercy,</HI> and becau&s;e <HI>need &s;o is:</HI> And if we are not GOD'S chil|dren, we are puni&s;hed <HI>le&s;s,</HI> much le&s;s, than our iniquities de&s;erve. (5.) That however <HI>grievous</HI> or <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>un|comfortable</HI> our lots are, our wants and mi&s;eries cannot be of long continuance, but mu&s;t &s;oon be terminated by death. (6.) That the be&s;t of men, even the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD him&s;elf, have been in wor&s;e pre&s;ent circum&s;tances than we are; and yet were perfectly contented; from who&s;e examples we &s;hould learn this grace.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXII. CHASTITY <HI>and the contrary</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOD hath implanted in the &s;exes &s;uch appe|tites and affections towards each other as are nece&s;&s;ary for the propagation of our kind, and without which, probably the fir&s;t command, <Q>Multiply and re|pleni&s;h the earth,</Q> would not have been readily obeyed. And it is here worth ob&s;erving, as a proof of the divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, that a natural plea&s;ure is annexed to tho&s;e actions by which our kind is propa|gated, and life &s;upported and &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHASTITY con&s;i&s;ts in the regulation of the&s;e appe|tites and de&s;ires between the &s;exes.</P>
<P N="3">3. As GOD hath implanted no natural appetites in his creatures, for which he hath not provided lawful gratifications; &s;o the appetites between the &s;exes, may be gratified in a lawful manner. Wherefore, cha&s;tity con&s;i&s;ts not in <HI>eradicating</HI> the&s;e natural appetites, but in <HI>regulating</HI> them; re&s;training them within the bounds of moderation, and directing them to right objects. Hence appears the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>celebacy</HI> and a <HI>mona&s;tic life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. ALTHOUGH brutes, generally &s;peaking, are re|markably moderate in the gratification of the&s;e appe|tites, yet they cannot be called <HI>cha&s;te,</HI> having no con&s;ci|ence, and being under no moral or divine law. <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> therefore is a <HI>human</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> virtue, ari&s;ing from rea&s;on, reflection, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the authority of a divine law.</P>
<P N="5">5. REASON and <HI>reflection</HI> will quickly convince us that the loo&s;e and unbounded gratification of the ap|petites
<PB N="163" REF="014137_0162_0F97D51D33EDEA30">between the &s;exes, would be productive of the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs in human &s;ociety; and therefore <HI>marriage,</HI> (the only remedy again&s;t this mi&s;chief) has been held &s;acred and venerable among almo&s;t all nations, who have had little el&s;e than the dictates of natural rea&s;on for their guide. Indeed, other gratifications of the&s;e appetites have been tolerated among &s;ome of them. And the more bruti&s;h the&s;e nations have been, the more unbounded and unre&s;trained have they been in the gratifications of the&s;e appetites, (witne&s;s the ancient Britons.)</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Chri&s;tian revelation has limitted the gratifi|cation of the&s;e appetites to <HI>one woman</HI> and <HI>one man,</HI> in a &s;tate of marriage, during the life of either of the par|ties; and has &s;trictly, and upon the &s;evere&s;t penalties, forbid the gratification of them in any other way: The rea&s;ons of which limitation and prohibition, are very wi&s;e, and &s;ufficiently obvious: Hence we may learn what is <HI>uncha&s;tity,</HI> in <HI>deed, word,</HI> and <HI>thought.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. UNCHASTITY in <HI>deed,</HI> is when &s;ingle and unmar|ried per&s;ons do at all actually gratify the&s;e appetites; or when married per&s;ons at all actually gratify them, with any other per&s;ons than their own hu&s;bands or wives; and is di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;ins of <HI>fornication, adultery, ince&s;t, poligamy, &s;odomy</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-pollution.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. UNCHASTITY in thought or de&s;ire, is when one of either &s;ex, looketh upon one of the contrary &s;ex, which is a forbidden object, &s;o as to lu&s;t after them, or de&s;ire criminal conver&s;e with them. And how much more criminally uncha&s;te mu&s;t it be, &s;o to in|flame the heart with an ab&s;ent, forbidden object, as to act over the guilty &s;cene in imagination?</P>
<P N="9">9. UNCHASTITY in word, is when we u&s;e &s;uch fil|thy ob&s;cene language, as has a tendency to excite un|cha&s;te thoughts and de&s;ires, either in our&s;elves, or others. In order to maintain and pre&s;erve our cha&s;tity,
<PB N="164" REF="014137_0163_0F97D51DF3D0FBF0">the following things &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful:&mdash;(1.) To pray for, and endeavour after <HI>true conver&s;ion,</HI> or a <HI>new, clean,</HI> and <HI>pure</HI> heart; for while we have a corrupt na|ture, our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites will ever be inordinate and ungovernable.&mdash;(2.) To &s;hun all unnece&s;&s;ary inti|macy and familiarity with forbidden objects of the dif|ferent &s;ex, by which we may in&s;en&s;ibly contract unlaw|ful de&s;ires, which may in time lead to criminal actions; or, where a friend&s;hip is cultivated between the &s;exes, to improve it to the promoting of purity and virtue.&mdash;(3.) To chu&s;e and con&s;ort with &s;uch companions of our own &s;ex, as are mo&s;t cha&s;te and mode&s;t in their language and deportment; and on the contrary, to &s;hun all lewd, immode&s;t, profligate companions, who will &s;oon vitiate our ta&s;te, and corrupt our manners.&mdash;(4.) To be much in reading the &s;criptures, and &s;uch other books, as tend to purify the mind, and in&s;pire cha&s;te and holy thoughts; and cautiou&s;ly to &s;hun the peru&s;al of loo&s;e plays, &s;ongs, romances, and &s;uch tra&s;h as corrupt and debauch the mind.&mdash;(5.) Often to examine our own hearts, and meditate on the extreme evil and danger of uncha&s;tity; how unlike it renders us to the pure and holy GOD; how unfit for his enjoyment, and how obnoxious to his vengeance; that burning lu&s;ts, are fuel to kindle un|quenchable flames, in the place of torment.&mdash;(6.) Fa&s;ting and prayer, have been found excellent and effec|tual remedies for uncha&s;tity; and indeed, all the in|&s;trumental duties of religion &s;hould be u&s;ed in this view.&mdash;(7.) Cha&s;tity agrees well with diligence and &s;o|briety, and often dwells under the &s;ame roof with them. &mdash;(8.) Marriage is to many, the only remedy for un|cha&s;tity; and it is a lawful and honourable one.&mdash;(9.) But, in &s;hort, without a new and divine nature, and grace in exerci&s;e, nothing will effectually &s;ecure either married or &s;ingle from <HI>uncha&s;tity,</HI> either in <HI>thought, word,</HI> or <HI>action.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. CHRISTIAN courage or fortitude, is a being <HI>bold, fearle&s;s</HI> and <HI>intrepid</HI> in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and in our du|ty and allegiance to him.

But the re&s;olute and courageous Chri&s;tian, dares to be &s;ingularly good; he dares to &s;tem the torrent of popular depravity and chr|ruption; &mdash;he dares to be pious and upright, again&s;t the example of <HI>the multitude who do iniquity.</HI>&mdash;He can

<P N="1">1. THE noble&s;t u&s;e that can be made of the tongue, is to <HI>glorify</HI> GOD; which is done by this little in&s;trument, (1.) By praying to him. Thus we acknowledge our entire dependance on him for all that is needful to our happine&s;s. (2.) By prai&s;ing him. Thus we make known his loving kindne&s;s to his needy unde&s;erving creatures. (3.) By expre&s;&s;ing our admiration of his infinite perfections: Thus exalting his great name. (4.) By confe&s;&s;ing our iniquities: Thus magnifying his grace, which continues with us, notwith&s;tanding our &s;o great unworthine&s;s. (5.) By

By vindicating his providential go|vernment, and di&s;playing the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and equity of his ways. The&s;e are, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome of the principal ends for which the tongue is given to man.</P>
<P N="2">2. A VERY good and noble u&s;e of the tongue is, to promote by it the good of our neighbour; which we may do, (1.) By labouring to in&s;truct the ignorant in what may relate to the concerns of his body; but more e&s;pecially in what re&s;pects his &s;oul. (2.) By commen|dation, in &s;uch manner as may be an encouragement to him to proceed in the way of godline&s;s and virtue, &s;o as to advance his good name, and extend the &s;phere of his u&s;efulne&s;s: But in this good office, we &s;hould guard in a particular manner again&s;t flattery, or imprudent com|mendation, which is deadly poi&s;on to mo&s;t men. (4.) By <HI>peace-making:</HI> There being nothing more de&s;truc|tive to religion and virtue than malicious &s;trife; nor any thing more un&s;eemly in a Chri&s;tian. Tho&s;e there|fore who are the happy in&s;truments of removing this helli&s;h evil from between men, are, in a peculiar man|ner, con&s;idered by the GOD of peace as <HI>his children:</HI> And, (5.) By vindicating injured characters and per&s;ons. This is doing very great &s;ervice to men; di&s;covers a no|ble &s;pirit, and is an office that procures the e&s;teem of men, and GOD doubtle&s;s regards the di&s;charge of it with complacence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 35,&mdash;37.</NOTE>. (6.) One of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent u&s;es of the tongue, towards our fellow-crea|tures, after in&s;tructing them in the principles of religion, and animating them to the practice of it; is to pour the balm of con&s;olation into the wounded &s;pirit.

<P>THE unchri&s;tian abu&s;es of the tongue, form a &s;trong contra&s;t to the former &s;ubject.</P>

This is &s;triking at the glory of GOD with a witne&s;s, and erazing the very foundations of all religion among men. Equal|ly pernicious are tho&s;e &s;peeches and arguments, which, while they &s;eem to admit the being of a GOD, in&s;inuate, that he did not create, and does not rule and govern the world:&mdash;Or, allowing his univer&s;al providence, in giving general laws to nature, while they deny his par|ticular providence, or his ordering and over-ruling all the particular actions of his creatures.&mdash;Nor is it a whit better to deny GOD'S moral government of his ra|tional creatures; that he is the <HI>ob&s;erver of men;</HI> the wit|ne&s;s and judge, the rewarder and puni&s;her of their mo|ral conduct. To this may be added the vile guilt of robbing GOD of any of his per&s;ections, of his omni&s;ci|ence, omnipre&s;ence, his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, mercy or
<PB N="181" REF="014137_0180_0F97D52B731E6D00">truth;&mdash;or of extolling any of the&s;e perfections, to the prejudice of the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) BLASPHEMY: Either cur&s;ing GOD, as <HI>Job</HI>'s wife would have per&s;uaded him to do; or challenging GOD to come forth, and do his wor&s;t; or boldly and in&s;olently defying his vengeance; or charging him fooli&s;hly, as cruel and unju&s;t, and laying more on us than we de&s;erve; or boldly calling down his vengeance upon our&s;elves or others; or &s;porting with his judg|ments, undervaluing his mercies, and ridiculing his works, or word, or providences. This is to do all that we can to deba&s;e and vili&s;y the Almighty, by &s;peaking of him in a manner that we dared not to do of a digni|fied fellow-worm.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) PROFANITY, nearly bordering on the former. Speaking &s;lightly and di&s;re&s;pectfully of holy things and ordinances, and that holine&s;s which is the image of GOD on his people;&mdash;mimicking and mocking holy ac|tions, &s;uch as prayer, preaching, the &s;acraments, and the like;&mdash;making a je&s;t of the &s;criptures, and u&s;ing them proverbially to pro&s;ane purpo&s;es;&mdash;&s;peaking &s;lightingly of the laws of GOD and the rules of holine&s;s, as not worth our notice;&mdash;making a mock at &s;in as a meer trifle, and talking of the mo&s;t awful and &s;erious matters, &s;uch as death, judgment, heaven and hell, in &s;uch a &s;light, vain, and &s;portive manner, as plainly &s;hews that we have no practical belief of them.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) SOLEMN perjury; or calling GOD to witne&s;s a known lie, and praying down his vengeance upon us, in ca&s;e our declaration be not true, when we know that it is not.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) COMMON &s;wearing; which by the frequent and familiar abu&s;e of GOD'S holy name, le&s;&s;ens our own re|verence and that of others for an oath; turns the vene|rable name of JEHOVAH, into a meer <HI>&s;carecrow,</HI> or an <HI>empty &s;ound,</HI> to convey our helli&s;h pa&s;&s;ions to others, and
<PB N="182" REF="014137_0181_0F97D52C33442158">paves the way to <HI>cu&s;tomary, horrid perjury.</HI> This is an abu&s;e of the tongue, which, be&s;ides its being forbidden by the word of GOD, on the penalty of his &s;evere&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure, is attended with neither plea&s;ure, profit nor ho|nour; &mdash;is rude, barbarous, uncivil, and unmeaning, and fit only for <HI>devils</HI> and <HI>damned &s;pirits.</HI></P>
<P N="6">(6.) THE common and profane u&s;e of GOD'S name, even where neither cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, nor damning is annexed to it: Such as, O GOD! O LORD! O CHRIST! <HI>E Gad! O Je!</HI> and GOD ble&s;s us! CHRIST ble&s;s us! and the like, when they are &s;poken in a <HI>light, unmeaning, cu&s;tomary</HI> manner: For, as GOD'S name is &s;a|cred and glorious, &s;o every <HI>common u&s;e</HI> of it, is an <HI>irreve|rent abu&s;e</HI> of it, and is expre&s;sly forbidden in the third commandment, <Q>Thou &s;halt not take the name of the LORD thy GOD in vain, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. As the next important u&s;e of the tongue, is to pro|mote the good of our fellow-creatures; &s;o, whatever tends directly, or indirectly to hurt or injure our neigh|bour, in any of his intere&s;ts, is a <HI>vile, unchri&s;tian, diaboli|cal</HI> abu&s;e of it. Indeed, all the above-mentioned abu&s;es of it, are again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian charity:</HI> For, though they di|rectly and immediately tend to di&s;honour GOD, yet they mediately and indirectly tend to corrupt and ruin our neighbour. Indeed, whatever &s;in comes the length of the tongue, <HI>is,</HI> and nece&s;&s;arily <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> de&s;iling to all around us, who are di&s;po&s;ed to receive infection. But the abu&s;es of the tongue, which are mo&s;t immediately repugnant to Chri&s;tian charity, are the following: (1.) <HI>Direct lying,</HI> or <HI>untruth:</HI> For, as the tongue and &s;peech were given to be a true and regular <HI>index</HI> and <HI>interpreter</HI> of the mind; &s;o a man who &s;peaks not truth, is like a <HI>clock</HI> who&s;e hand points to the wrong hour, or like a <HI>com|pa&s;s</HI> who&s;e needle deviates from the true pole, <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> and <HI>worth nothing.</HI> Be&s;ides, as truth is the foundation of all right intercour&s;e between men, &s;o there could be no liv|ing

Indeed, truth is &s;o <HI>&s;acred, valuable</HI> and <HI>important</HI> a branch of Chri|&s;tian morality, and &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the well|being of human &s;ociety, that it &s;hould never be violated, even in je&s;t, or upon the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t trivial occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) DISSIMULATION: Either by willfully conceal|ing nece&s;&s;ary truth, or &s;peaking in a doubtful, ambigu|ous, enigmatical manner, with a de&s;ign to deceive or mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lead our neighbour.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) DOUBLE-DEALING; being fair to our neigh|bour's face, and otherwi&s;e behind his back.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) MISREPRESENTING a <HI>&s;tory</HI> or <HI>fact,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous kinds of lying and back-biting; for, by omitting <HI>one &s;ingle word</HI> or <HI>circum&s;tance</HI> of a &s;tory or fact, it may be quite altered to the un&s;peakable pre|judice of our neighbour and of the truth.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) DECEITFUL-PROMISING: Cau&s;ing our neigh|bour to rely on a promi&s;e, which we either do not in|tend to per&s;orm at all, or which we have no hope of being able to perform punctually, at the time and in the manner propo&s;ed: This makes un&s;peakable confu&s;ion in the <HI>trading world,</HI> and in every other department of life, and tends effectually to ruin our character, and ve|ry often our neighbour's too, who is led to deceive others on the &s;trength of our promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) BEARING FALSE WITNESS again&s;t our neigh|bour; either by telling known and malicious lies to the prejudice of our neighbour, in the way of calumny, &s;lander and back-biting; or by unnece&s;&s;arily abetting, propagating and &s;preading the &s;landers of others, whom we have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect of malice again&s;t him: Much more, by taking away his life, intere&s;t, or good name, by perjury.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) SPEAKING the very wor&s;t that we can of our

<P N="8">(8.) DIVULGING and <HI>blabbing</HI> out &s;uch &s;ecrets as our neighbour may have, in confidence entru&s;ted us with, either with a malicious de&s;ign to hurt him, or through meer imprudence, and a tatling di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) ALL &s;uch abu&s;ive, ignominious names and in|&s;ulting language, either <HI>of</HI> or <HI>to</HI> our neighbour, as tends to break Chri&s;tian charity, &s;tir up anger, and occa&s;ion quarrels and law-&s;uits; which be&s;ides their provoking nature and unhappy con&s;equences, prove the want of charity, meekne&s;s, humility and patience, and are a &s;candal and di&s;grace to our common Chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 21,&mdash;26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) ALL &s;porting with, and mocking at the <HI>&s;ins</HI> and <HI>natural infirmities</HI> of our neighbour, and &s;peaking, le&s;&s;en|ing degrading things of him, on account of the latter.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) VAIN, <HI>idle, unedifying</HI> conver&s;ation, which neither tends to <HI>comfort</HI> or <HI>improve</HI> either our&s;elves or others, e&s;pecially if it is continued long, to the de&s;truction of our own, or our neighbour's precious time: For, we are told, we &s;hall <Q>give an account of every idle word we &s;peak at the day of judgment.</Q></P>
<P N="12">(12.) PROPAGATING evil, pernicious principles and doctrines, which tend to poi&s;on our neighbour's mind, and to pave the way for a vicious practice.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) FLATTERING our neighbour in his follies and vices, and thereby feeding his pride and &s;trengthening his hands in folly and wickedne&s;s; more e&s;pecially, with the dete&s;table view of getting &s;ome &s;avour from him, or advantage over him, as the reward of this iniquity.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="185" REF="014137_0184_0F97D52F351AF498">
(14.) ABUSING our neighbour's confidence in us, by giving him bad or ruinous advice, when we hope to benefit by his complying with it.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) CORRUPTING our neighbour, and &s;educing <HI>him</HI> or <HI>her</HI> to &s;in, and thereby committing the very wor&s;t kind of murder, both upon the &s;oul and body of our neighbour.</P>

<P N="6">(6.) CRUELLY and unmercifully making the very wor&s;t of our neighbour's conduct, without making proper allowances for the temptations he lay under, and the di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances in which the&s;e temptation might attack him.

<HEAD>ESSAY XLI. <HI>Of a</HI> MERCIFUL TEMPER, <HI>and its oppo&s;ites.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. MERCY, is a <HI>kind, compa&s;&s;ionate, &s;ympathi&s;ing</HI> concern for the <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> which prompts to a readine&s;s to help, relieve, or at lea&s;t alleviate their mi|&s;eries, when it is <HI>in the power</HI> of the merciful, and <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right</HI> to be done.</P>
<P N="2">2. AS there could have been no place for the exer|ci&s;e of the divine mercy, unle&s;s mi&s;ery had made its en|trance among creatures; &s;o, nor could there have been place for the exerci&s;e of mercy between man and man, if mankind were not mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="3">3. MERCY, as it is a Chri&s;tian virtue, mu&s;t have its &s;eat in the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>temper;</HI> therefore, we are command|ed to "put on bowels of mercies." It is al&s;o like all other Chri&s;tian graces, a <HI>fruit of the Spirit;</HI> a part of that image of GOD rein&s;tampt upon the fallen &s;oul, in con|ver&s;ion.

<P N="6">6. MERCY, as a Chri&s;tian grace, has its fir&s;t and <HI>chief</HI> re&s;pect to <HI>men's &s;ouls;</HI> the troubles and mi&s;eries which they &s;uffer, and the dangers to which they are expo&s;ed by &s;in: And indeed, this concern for the mi|&s;ery of men's &s;ouls, is the chief character which di&s;|tingui&s;hes <HI>Chri&s;tian mercy,</HI> from <HI>mere humanity.</HI> How many good natured men in the world, who&s;e hearts bleed to &s;ee a fellow-creature in bodily pain or mi&s;ery, and who would go almo&s;t any lengths to relieve him; yet have no mercy on their own &s;ouls, or the &s;ouls of their

<P N="7">7. MERCY is not confined to the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> but reaches to the <HI>whole man.</HI> Here it &s;trikes in with <HI>humanity,</HI> and improves it; weeping with them that weep, and look|ing not only at its <HI>own things,</HI> but al&s;o on the <HI>things of others.</HI> It pities and &s;ympathizes with the pains and di&s;ea&s;es of others bodies; the troubles and perplexities of their minds; their wants and nece&s;&s;ities; their di&s;|a&s;ters and di&s;appointments; their oppre&s;&s;ions and afflic|tions. And when in its power, it labours to mitigate all the&s;e afflictions, by drawing out its &s;oul to the hungry; by clothing the naked; by helping the &s;ick; by pleading the cau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ed; by admini&s;tring coun&s;el to the perplexed, and comfort to the &s;orrowing and afflicted. And whereas, <HI>mere humanity</HI> only does the&s;e things from <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> and to ea&s;e the anxiety of the mind on the &s;ight of di&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;the merciful Chri&s;tian does them from love to his neighbour, from a con&s;ide|ration of duty, and from obedience to the authority of GOD.</P>
<P N="8">8. BUT a merciful di&s;po&s;ition is &s;een in its greate&s;t lu&s;tre and advantage, when it pities and forgives per|&s;ons who, by injurious treatment to our&s;elves, are wholly at our mercy, and upon whom we have it fully
<PB N="203" REF="014137_0202_0F97D49CF4031040">in our power to glut our revenge; yea, when we may do &s;o under the colour of ju&s;tice. This is <HI>God-like</HI> mercy indeed! But.</P>
<P N="9">9. IT belongs to Chri&s;tian <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> to judge, <HI>to whom,</HI> and <HI>how far,</HI> &s;uch acts of mercy &s;hould extend. That lenity which would prompt us to give up our rights upon all occa&s;ions to lawle&s;s men, might often be of mi&s;chievous con&s;equence:&mdash;It might often tend to harden &s;inners in their vices, and embolden them to treat others as they have done us, with hopes of impunity. By forgiving a man who attempts my life, I may procure the murder of other innocent per|&s;ons. By pardoning and giving liberty to a robber, whom I have caught breaking open my hou&s;e, and pillaging my goods, I embolden this villain to rob my neighbour's. Nor is it in all ca&s;es proper or prudent for a man to forgive per&s;onal injuries, without legal &s;a|tisfaction and examplary puni&s;hment. Acts of lenity and mercy to offenders, &s;hould always con&s;i&s;t with a proper concern for the public good, and our own per|&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P N="10">10. CHRISTIAN mercy, however, is always &s;orry for the authors of injuries, and heartily wi&s;hes their <HI>repen|tance</HI> and <HI>eternal welfare.</HI> It will never admit of cruelty or revenge again&s;t an offender. If his crime will ad|mit of it, it is willing to forgive him, upon proper marks of repentance. If puni&s;hment is nece&s;&s;ary, it would have it to be of the milde&s;t and gentle&s;t nature, that the offence will admit of; and it pities the per&s;on of the guilty &s;ufferer, and would rejoice if the puni&s;h|ment might be wholly remitted;&mdash;having nothing at heart but the intere&s;t of human &s;ociety, virtue and ju&s;|tice; and, like GOD, taking no plea&s;ure in the mi&s;ery of &s;inners.</P>
<P N="11">11. THERE is al&s;o ample room for the di&s;play of mercy, in the exaction of debts. If the debtor is
<PB N="204" REF="014137_0203_0F97D49DB52944A8">fallen into poverty by accidents or misfortunes, it will bear with him, if able; or if able, and circum&s;tances allow, will remit <HI>part</HI> or <HI>whole</HI> of the debt: Or, if he is even bankrupt by his own fault, and therefore, ju&s;tly de&s;erves to &s;uffer as a criminal, yet it will con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances of his innocent family and connexions, and will remit what it can on their be|half.</P>
<P N="12">12. THOUGH mercy &s;hould extend to <HI>all</HI> in <HI>the&s;e in|&s;tances;</HI> yet it will be &s;hown in the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> and in the <HI>highe&s;t degree,</HI> to tho&s;e whom GOD and nature hath con|nected mo&s;t intimately with us; &s;uch as our families, relations and friends: For, it would be a prepo&s;terous di&s;po&s;ition, and not Chri&s;tian mercy, to pity and help &s;trangers, while our own hou&s;ehold, kindred and friends were di&s;regarded by us, in their mi&s;ery.&mdash;Above all,</P>
<P N="13">13. OUR <HI>Chri&s;tian brethren</HI> claim a <HI>peculiar part</HI> in our bowels of mercies. If one member &s;uffers, all the members &s;hould &s;uffer with it. <Q>We are to bear one another's burdens, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="14">14. OUR <HI>heathen &s;laves</HI> are proper objects and excel|lent te&s;ts of a merciful di&s;po&s;ition. Their <HI>ca&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;tate</HI> is allowed to be very <HI>pitiable</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> upon al|mo&s;t all accounts. They often provoke us, and needs mu&s;t. They are, in a manner, entirely at our mercy, and their very lives in our hands. They are <HI>our fellow creatures,</HI> and <HI>might</HI> and <HI>&s;hould</HI> be our <HI>Chri&s;tian brethren.</HI> They are GOD'S <HI>creatures,</HI> and <HI>our neighbours,</HI> whom we &s;hould <HI>love as our&s;elves.</HI> And &s;urely, if a merciful man, will be merciful even to his bea&s;t, much more ought he to be &s;o to his <HI>human &s;lave!</HI>&mdash;It may therefore be de|pended on, that tho&s;e who have no pity for their &s;laves, but are of an <HI>unfeeling, cruel, mercile&s;s</HI> temper towards them, are &s;trangers to this grace.</P>
<P N="15">15. THIS is one of the mo&s;t amiable and GOD-like of all the Chri&s;tian virtues, being that temper by which we
<PB N="205" REF="014137_0204_0F97D49E766D0F48">do, in a mo&s;t eminent manner, re&s;emble and bear the image of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and his Son <HI>Je&s;us</HI> CHRIST; who forgive us <HI>ten thou&s;and talents,</HI> and are merciful to the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>unthankful.</HI></P>

<P N="11">11. AS to the <HI>excellency</HI> of this rule, and <HI>our obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ons</HI> to conform to it, they are both &s;elf-evident. It is founded on the <HI>&s;amene&s;s of nature</HI> in men, and their <HI>natu|ral equality.</HI> The relative and accidental differences be|tween men, are &s;mall in their own nature, and very

<P N="12">12. THIS is a rule of ju&s;tice which has obtained among all nations, it being a clear dictate of rea&s;on, and of the law of nature,&mdash;<Q>Not to do to others what we would not bear from them; and to do to others, in all ca&s;es, what we would rea&s;onably expect from them.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLIII. CHRISTIAN HOPE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Chri&s;tian hope</HI> is a firm expectation of that future and eternal happine&s;s, which GOD hath promi&s;ed to his faithful obedient people, upon a rational and well-grounded per&s;ua&s;ion, that they have complied with the terms of his gracious covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE object of Chri&s;tian hope is the <HI>divine promi&s;es,</HI> contained in GOD'S word; for, it is upon his word that he cau&s;eth his &s;ervants to hope: And it ever pre|&s;uppo&s;es, a firm faith in the&s;e promi&s;es.&mdash;Chri&s;tian hope, therefore, is ever built upon <HI>faith,</HI> and can reach no farther than its foundation: For, we cannot rationally <HI>hope for,</HI> or <HI>expect</HI> that which we do not believe that we &s;hall receive.</P>
<P N="3">3. I HAVE &s;aid, the object of Chri&s;tian hope is the divine promi&s;es; though it may be rather &s;aid to be the ble&s;&s;ings contained in the divine promi&s;es, the chief and mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive of which is, GOD him&s;elf, as the <HI>chief good of our natures,</HI> the comprehen&s;ive &s;um total of all our happine&s;s; and therefore it is &s;aid, by way of eminence, "That our hope may be in GOD," as the ultimate object of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 31.</NOTE>. For, if we pur&s;ue every pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="212" REF="014137_0211_0F97D4A489011978">ble&s;&s;ing or happine&s;s to the &s;ource of it, we will find it centered in GOD, and flowing from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST is al&s;o &s;ometimes called <HI>our hope,</HI> as the channel of all divine ble&s;&s;ings to us, and the great <HI>pro|mulgator</HI> and <HI>revealer</HI> of the divine promi&s;es. And we are &s;aid to abound in hope, through the power of the <HI>holy Gho&s;t;</HI> becau&s;e, as he is the worker of <HI>faith,</HI> &s;o of <HI>hope,</HI> in the hearts of Chri&s;tians; bearing witne&s;s with their &s;pirits, that they are children and heirs of GOD; confirming their rational inferences as to the goodne&s;s and &s;afety of their &s;tate; per&s;uading them of the power and faithfulne&s;s of GOD, and the certain accompli&s;h|ment of his promi&s;es, and &s;weetly a&s;&s;uring their hearts, &s;o as to rai&s;e them above tormenting fear, anxious doubtings, and di&s;tracting de&s;pair.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE primary foundations of Chri&s;tian hope, as well as of Chri&s;tian faith, are the <HI>unchangeable truth</HI> and <HI>almighty power</HI> of GOD.&mdash;He <HI>cannot lie,</HI> and he can do all things which are the objects of power; con&s;equent|ly, he can neither <HI>deceive our faith</HI> nor <HI>di&s;appoint our hopes.</HI> What&s;oever therefore GOD hath <HI>&s;aid</HI> or <HI>promi&s;ed,</HI> we can never confidently enough expect and hope for, nor firmly enough believe.</P>
<P N="6">6. MEN may be &s;trong in the Chri&s;tian hope, giving glory to GOD; that is, they may firmly believe the truth of his word, and the &s;ure accompli&s;hment of his promi&s;es to his people, while they may be very doubtful of their own &s;tate, and &s;o be deprived of the <HI>joy of hope:</HI> For, as hope &s;uppo&s;es faith, and faith re&s;ts upon a divine promi&s;e; while we cannot clearly and rationally apply this promi&s;e to our&s;elves, we cannot yet hope for the accompli&s;hment of it to our&s;elves.&mdash; Yet we may clearly &s;ee our title to the promi&s;ed ble&s;|&s;ing on condition we did but truly believe and apply the promi&s;e. Hence it clearly follows, that our hope
<PB N="213" REF="014137_0212_0F97D4A53672E760">mu&s;t ever keep pace with the evidence of our title to the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing. Where we have no rational evidence of this, we can have no rational hope; and according to the <HI>&s;trength of our evidence,</HI> &s;uch will be the <HI>&s;trength of our hope.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. HENCE it is al&s;o clear, that all the hopes of wick|ed men, and even of men (however &s;ober, moral, and orderly in their lives) who are yet without any rational evidence of their being truly religious, are mere <HI>wicked, groundle&s;s pre&s;umptions,</HI> which only &s;erve to keep up their fatal &s;ecurity, and to render their damnation the more certain and the more dreadful: For, how dreadful mu&s;t it be for tho&s;e men to find all their <HI>towering airy</HI> hopes, piercing them like broken reeds, and breading under them like a &s;pider's web, only to render their fall into endle&s;s mi&s;ery and de&s;pair the deeper and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P N="8">8. HENCE it appears, that <HI>de&s;pair,</HI> is a more pro|mi&s;ing &s;ymptom in wicked men, than the mo&s;t <HI>con|fident hopes.</HI> And that the foundation of a true Chri&s;tian hope in all &s;uch, mu&s;t be laid deep in an utter de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing the face of GOD in mercy, while they continue void of true religion, and under the pow|er of wicked habits.</P>
<P N="9">9. CHRISTIAN hope is di&s;tingui&s;hed from worldly hopes, by the <HI>excellency of its objects,</HI> and the <HI>&s;tability of its foundation.</HI> Its principal object, as we ob&s;erved, is GOD, and an eternal &s;tate of glory and happine&s;s; in his pre|&s;ence, wherein we &s;hall be conformed to the image of his Son; and its foundation is the <HI>divine power</HI> and <HI>faith|fulne&s;s;</HI> &s;o that it is a <HI>&s;ure, glorious</HI> and <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> hope. But <HI>all, all</HI> &s;ublunary hopes are mean in their nature, uncer|tain in their attainment, and deceitful and un&s;atisfying in their fruition and enjoyment.</P>
<P N="10">10. TO hope for the perfection of our nature, and the full enjoyment of GOD, is a <HI>glorious hope,</HI> which by
<PB N="214" REF="014137_0213_0F97D4A5F4265B68">its very nature, tends to rai&s;e, purify and refine our &s;ouls, and which when enjoyed, will leave us not a &s;ingle wi&s;h or de&s;ire ungratified: But earthly hopes; the hopes of honours, wealth, power, or &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, are of a low, mean nature, and naturally tend to depre&s;s and &s;en|&s;ualize the mind: And, even when they come to be at|tained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> do they di&s;appoint us?

This is the rea&s;on why <HI>young men</HI> are generally more &s;anguine in their hopes and expectations from the world, than <HI>old men,</HI> who, by a woful experience, have &s;o often found all their hopes from it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;trated, and that all its mo&s;t gay and promi&s;ing appearances, are extremely flattering and deceitful. But it is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tick of the Chri&s;tian hope, that it is a &s;ure and certain hope; and tho&s;e who enjoy it know it to be &s;o. Al|though the objects of the Chri&s;tian's hopes, are fu|ture and un&s;een, yet his hope gives them a pre&s;ence and reality, and therefore the patient waiting for this hope, is attended with joy and comfort. The interval of a thou&s;and years did not weaken <HI>Abraham's</HI> hope of the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> but he <HI>rejoiced to &s;ee his day,</HI> be|cau&s;e he knew that GOD <HI>was faithful who promi&s;ed.</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="014137_0214_0F97D4A6B46D43C0">Such al&s;o is the Chri&s;tian's hope of future glory; though he has not yet &s;een it, yet believing, he re|joices in a&s;&s;ured expectation of it, with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P N="12">12. HOPE is exceeding &s;uitable to our <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate.</HI>&mdash; In heaven it is excluded by full enjoyment, and in hell, by utter de&s;pair: But, as we are here in a <HI>middle &s;tate,</HI> between the two worlds;&mdash;as we are now in a &s;tate of trial and expectance, it is perfectly fit that we &s;hould be governed and influenced by the hope of a future re|ward, which tends, on the one hand, to quicken our diligence in our proper work, and on the other, to pre|&s;erve us from &s;lothful de&s;pondency.</P>
<P N="13">13. HOPE is highly nece&s;&s;ary to the Chri&s;tian in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. Surrounded with temptations both terrifying and alluring, to draw us away from our duty, the hope of &s;alvation is our <HI>helmet</HI> and <HI>brea&s;tplate;</HI> to&s;|&s;ed with the &s;torms of doubts, perplexities, worldly cares and per&s;ecutions, hope is the <HI>anchor of the &s;oul,</HI> &s;ure and &s;teadfa&s;t, that enters within the vail, and, be|ing fixed on the immortal &s;hore, gives the &s;oul &s;ecurity and re&s;t; harra&s;&s;ed with &s;ore afflictions, and pa&s;&s;ing through the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death, what could &s;upport us but the Chri&s;tian hope? This was the boa&s;t of the afflicted Apo&s;tles: They gloried even in tribulations, rejoicing in the hope of the glory of GOD; they reckoned their greate&s;t &s;ufferings not wor|thy to be compared with the glory to be revealed; looking at things invi&s;ible and eternal, they knew their <HI>light</HI> and <HI>momentary</HI> afflictions wrought out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. This was the &s;upport of the <HI>martyrs</HI> under all their &s;ufferings in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when all men per&s;ecute you: Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your rew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE>.</Q> in &s;hort, hope

<P N="14">14. TRUE Chri&s;tian hope, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>carnal confidence</HI> and <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> chiefly by its <HI>quickening</HI> and <HI>purifying</HI> effects. <Q>He who hath this hope in him, purifyeth him&s;elf as GOD is pure.</Q> If we be|lieve the many great and precious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, and are cau&s;ed to hope for their accompli&s;h|ment, <Q>We &s;hall clean&s;e our&s;elves from all filthine&s;s both of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and perfect holine&s;s in the fear of GOD.</Q> When a man's hopes do not purify his &s;oul, nor make him diligent in his Chri&s;tian duty, but leave him wicked, carele&s;s and &s;lothful, it may be depended on, that they are mere groundle&s;s pre|&s;umptions; tho&s;e hopes of the hypocrite which pe|ri&s;h. The Chri&s;tian hope is a <HI>lively hope;</HI> the inward &s;pring of fervent de&s;ires, reviving joys and zealous en|deavours. The man who has got a believing view of the high prize of glory, pre&s;&s;es on towards it, with un|remitting diligence, and purifies <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> becau&s;e he knows none but the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> will receive it, or can enjoy it.</P>
<P N="15">15. THE Chri&s;tian hope tends to <HI>purify, clean&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;anctify</HI> all who have it, in various ways; as, (1.) By the objects of it, which are the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> GOD, and a &s;tate of <HI>pure</HI> and holy <HI>ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI> Indeed, none but &s;uch as are in &s;ome mea&s;ure purified from their lu&s;ts and &s;ins, can entertain or plea&s;e them&s;elves with &s;uch a hope at all: Whence it follows, that no wicked per&s;ons ever <HI>had,</HI> or <HI>can</HI> have a <HI>true Chri&s;tian hope.</HI>&mdash;(2.) Tho&s;e who have this hope are purified by the frequent and &s;erious thoughts of GOD, and heavenly glory. As the object of their hope is &s;piritual and divine; &s;o the
<PB N="217" REF="014137_0216_0F97D4A833D31AE8">frequent contemplation of it purifies and rai&s;es their af|fections from the earth, and transforms them into the &s;ame likene&s;s: As the Chri&s;tian's hope, trea&s;ure and heart are in heaven, &s;o it is likely his conver&s;ation will be there al&s;o.</P>
<P N="16">16.

<P N="17">17. HOW great will their fall be, who fall from a conceited and imaginary heaven into a real hell? Hope, of all the pa&s;&s;ions, is the mo&s;t calm and quiet; but when di&s;appointed, the rage, impatience, &s;orrow and de&s;pair of hell mu&s;t follow.

To foretel, with certainty, future events, relative to the church of GOD, or the members of it, or others, which &s;eemed to depend, for their ex|i&s;tence, on uncertain contingencies and events. This was the twofold bu&s;ine&s;s of both the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> prophets; and in the Jewi&s;h church, there were certain e&s;tabli&s;hed marks of trial, whereby the <HI>true</HI> prophets, were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> Now, in both the&s;e re&s;pects, Chri&s;t is the <HI>prime</HI> and <HI>chief</HI> prophet of the church; nay, he may be &s;aid, by way of eminence, to be the <HI>only true</HI> Prophet of GOD; becau&s;e all other true

<P N="4">4.

Other prophets can only declare GOD'S will to men, from the revelati|on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and after this have no more that they can do, not being able to di&s;pen&s;e the quickening Spirit, without which the outward declaration of GOD'S will, is ineffectual to the &s;alvation of &s;inners: But this divine Prophet is not only the original <HI>revealer</HI> and <HI>declarer</HI> of GOD'S <HI>will,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>di&s;pen&s;er of the Spirit,</HI> by which he can, when he plea&s;es, reveal GOD'S will inwardly to the hearts and con&s;ciences of &s;inners, and make it ope|rative and effectual there for their &s;alvation.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLVI. <HI>The</HI> PRIESTLY OFFICE <HI>of</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Aaronical prie&s;thood, was a type of the prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, though the prie&s;thood of <HI>Melchi&s;edec,</HI> was a more perfect one: Con&s;equently, the Jewi&s;h high-prie&s;ts, and <HI>Melchi&s;edec,</HI> were types of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. TWO qualifications were nece&s;&s;ary to the Jewi&s;h high-prie&s;ts: (1.) That they &s;hould be of the &s;ame nature with their brethren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 1. 2.&mdash;iv. 15.</NOTE>.&mdash;(2.) That they &s;hould be &s;olemnly &s;eparated and &s;et apart to their office, by the appointment of GOD, and by con&s;ecretion or inve&s;|titure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 1, 4.</NOTE>. Now Chri&s;t, the great high-prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion, had both the&s;e qualifications<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 14, 17.&mdash;v. 5. 6, 9, 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS the prie&s;t's office, is founded on the fallen &s;tate of human nature, and appointed in relief of the guilty, it con&s;i&s;ts of two parts or branches: (1.) To offer &s;acrifice: And, (2.) To make interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. SACRIFICES were of two kinds under the law: Either <HI>euchari&s;tical,</HI> as acknowledgments of mercies; and the&s;e were commonly called <HI>gifts,</HI> and were <HI>unbloody,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the fruits of the earth, &amp;c. Or, they were <HI>expiatory,</HI> or <HI>atonements</HI> for &s;in, and the&s;e were called <HI>&s;a|crifices,</HI> and were always <HI>bloody;</HI> for, without &s;hedding of blood, there was no remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</P>
<P N="5">5. CHRIST, in this &s;en&s;e, was a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real &s;acrifice.</HI> His &s;oul was made <HI>an offering for &s;in.</HI> Thus he is called, <Q>The Lamb of GOD which taketh away the &s;ins of

<P N="6">6. THE entire human nature of Chri&s;t was the &s;acri|fice which he offered up for the &s;ins of the world.&mdash;He not only gave his <HI>&s;oul</HI> or <HI>life</HI> and offering for &s;in, but bore our &s;ins in his own body on the tree:&mdash;And this &s;acrifice received its dignity and value from his <HI>divine nature,</HI> which offered the human: For he, through the eternal Spirit, offered him&s;elf up without &s;pot unto GOD<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. BY this &s;acrifice has Chri&s;t made an atonement for &s;in; &s;atisfied the demands of divine ju&s;tice; con|firmed and illu&s;trated the truth, holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of GOD, and made his law exceeding honourable; pur|cha&s;ed our forfeited ble&s;&s;ings and lo&s;t happine&s;s; open|ed a way for the mercy of GOD to all the &s;inful race of <HI>Adam;</HI> and procured the pardon of &s;in, the divine fa|vour, the gift of the Spirit, and eternal life for every &s;oul of man who will fall in with his &s;aving de&s;ign, and take him as their <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>King</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 7. 1 Tim. ii. 5.

<P N="8">8. THE interce&s;&s;ory part of the Prie&s;t's office, was to offer up the prayers of the people and to intercede for them. The high-prie&s;t entered into the holie&s;t of all on the great day of atonement or expiation, and ble&s;&s;ed the people in the name of the Lord; &s;prinkling the blood of their &s;acrifices before the mercy-&s;eat. Chri&s;t, in like manner, having offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice of atonement for our &s;ins, hath entered into heaven, in the virtue of his mo&s;t precious blood, to offer up the pray|ers of his people, and make interce&s;&s;ion for them<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 12, 24.

9. AS Chri&s;t was of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> not of <HI>Levi,</HI> from whom the Aaronical prie&s;thood de&s;cended, &s;o he is &s;aid to be a <Q>prie&s;t for ever after the order of Mel|chi&s;edec.</Q> The re&s;emblance between the prie&s;t|hood of Chri&s;t and that of <HI>Melchi&s;edec</HI> is remarkable in &s;everal ca&s;es: (1.) In the ancientne&s;s of that order, and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s paying tithes to <HI>Melchi&s;edec,</HI> and being ble&s;&s;ed by him, although the father of the Aaronical prie&s;thood. (2.) <HI>Melchi&s;edec</HI> was a <HI>prie&s;t upon a throne,</HI> or a <HI>king</HI> as well as a <HI>prie&s;t;</HI> &s;o was Chri&s;t. (3.) The original and de&s;cent of <HI>Melchi&s;edec</HI> was peculiar<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 3.</NOTE>; &s;o was Chri&s;t's: For, who can declare his generation? (4.) The prie&s;thood of <HI>Melchi&s;edec</HI> was not encumbered with &s;uch a <HI>ritual,</HI> and &s;o many ceremonies and carnal commandments and ordinances, as that of <HI>Aaron;</HI> but was more &s;imple and catholic: So is Chri&s;t's.</P>
<P N="10">10. THERE are &s;everal things in the prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t peculiar to it&s;elf; as, (1.) He was perfectly &s;in|le&s;s, although he tran&s;acted with GOD for &s;inners. (2.) Other prie&s;ts offered <HI>brutal &s;acrifices,</HI> but Chri&s;t offered <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> He was both the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> and the <HI>&s;acrifice.</HI> His divine nature was the altar on which he offered up the humanity. (3.) Other prie&s;ts offered <HI>many &s;acrifices,</HI> even <HI>daily;</HI> whereas he offered but <HI>one &s;acrifice</HI> of infinite value and virtue. (4.) Other prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices, were ineffectual for expiating or taking away <HI>moral guilt:</HI> They made not him who did the &s;ervice, or for whom it was done, <HI>perfect</HI> as pertaining to the <HI>con&s;cience:</HI> They only took away the guilt of ceremonial pollutions or omi&s;&s;ions: But the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t takes away the guilt of all &s;in. This is <Q>the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the &s;in of the world.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. THE prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, and his mo&s;t expen|&s;ive &s;acrifice, &s;hould put us in mind of our guilty &s;tate,
<PB N="233" REF="014137_0232_0F97D4B4F4AF1B38">and of the malignant nature of &s;in; &s;eeing there could have been no remi&s;&s;ion of the very &s;malle&s;t &s;in, without the &s;heding of the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12.

<P N="13">13. HOW <HI>freely, cheerfully,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;uredly</HI> &s;hould we de|pend on the merit of &s;uch a &s;acrifice as this?

<HEAD>ESSAY XLVIII. <HI>The due</HI> IMPROVEMENT <HI>of</HI> TIME.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we &s;hall have con&s;idered the &s;hortne&s;s of time; its va&s;t importance, and pointed out the be&s;t methods of redeeming and improving it, we &s;hall have exhau&s;ted this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;hortne&s;s of time, both <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> and <HI>relative|ly</HI> con&s;idered, is &s;o very obvious to per&s;ons who are the lea&s;t capable of reflection and ob&s;ervation, that little need be &s;aid of it: For, (1.) How &s;mall a thing is the aggregate of time, making one total &s;um of all its di&s;|tinctive periods, from the fir&s;t birth of created things, to the final di&s;&s;olution of this world and the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and till time &s;hall be computed no more? A few thou&s;ands of fleeting years will &s;um it all. Yet a little while, and the mighty angel &s;hall lift up his hand to heaven, and &s;wear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that <HI>time &s;hall be no more.</HI> (2.) If we con&s;ider time as <HI>relative to us,</HI> or the <HI>mea&s;ure of our duration;</HI> what a <HI>&s;pan,</HI> what an <HI>hand-breadth,</HI> what a <HI>cvpher</HI> is it? How quickly are our years gone, as a tale that is told? A <HI>day,</HI> how quickly is it gone; and yet how few are the days of the years of our lives? That mighty thing a <HI>year,</HI> which looks &s;o large and exten&s;ive before us, how &s;wiftly does it pa&s;s, and how &s;hort and trifling does it look in retro&s;pect? Yet how few are the years of mo&s;t lives?&mdash;How quickly does a clock tell a <HI>&s;econd?</HI> While we pronounce the word, it is expired? Yet a &s;hort row of figures in <HI>&s;econds,</HI> makes the &s;um of a long life. When we &s;ee the heap of &s;and in the upper lobe of an
<PB N="238" REF="014137_0237_0F97D4B8B46C5578"><HI>hour-gla&s;s,</HI> and mark how &s;low it wa&s;tes, by running into the lower; we are apt to &s;ay, &s;urely this will be long in expending; yet within the &s;hort compa&s;s of an hour, all is fallen! Ju&s;t &s;uch is the life of man. Look for|ward upon fifty or &s;ixty years, it &s;eems an immen&s;e heap of time; but the fleeting tran&s;ient minutes quick|ly run it out, and bring it to a period. (3.) How com|paratively &s;mall is the period of mo&s;t human lives? It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that not every tenth per&s;on reaches the age of thirty years. The two thirds of our &s;pecies die in infancy, and the&s;e are happy? But from that age up, in which all are moral agents, and accountable for their actions, how many graves do we find of every length? How many die of every age? The thread of time (&s;hort at the very longe&s;t) is <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> and alas! <HI>unex|pectedly</HI> cut off, and they drop into their graves, like unripe fruit.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE nece&s;&s;ity of improving time, will appear not only from the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s of its duration,</HI> but from its <HI>va&s;t im|portance.</HI> (1.) Time is our <HI>only opportunity</HI> both for <HI>do|ing</HI> and <HI>receiving good,</HI> as <HI>accountable creatures. Opportunity</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of every great and good de&s;ign. If we had all the <HI>will</HI> and all the <HI>power</HI> in the world, to do good for our&s;elves or others; yet without opportunity, we can do nothing. The being that never exi&s;ted, (if &s;uch an <HI>ideal being</HI> is fairly &s;uppo&s;able) could never have any capacity or opportunity, either of enjoying or communicating good. The being which exi&s;ts but a &s;hort time, though it may have the noble&s;t capacities for doing and receiving good, yet <HI>its opportunity</HI> is only <HI>as its time.</HI> It is owing to the infinite goodne&s;s of GOD, that he ever created any be|ing at all, or gave unto them capacities and opportuni|ty of giving and enjoying good. The &s;imple exi&s;tence of every living creature which GOD hath made, is an
<PB N="239" REF="014137_0238_0F97D4BAA05DBC70">intentional favour and mercy to that creature; for, to <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> is to be in a capacity for happine&s;s. It is better even for <HI>ants</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>trifling in&s;ects to be,</HI> than <HI>not to be;</HI> for, even their &s;hort and in&s;ignificant duration, is filled with a happine&s;s &s;uitable to their nature. But, where <HI>&s;en&s;e, rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>immortality</HI> are &s;upperadded, to &s;uch beings, the intentional goodne&s;s of GOD is even infinitely greater; becau&s;e, to &s;uch beings, GOD hath not only given nobler capacities of communicating and receiving a higher and more &s;ublime happine&s;s, but hath al&s;o given them an opportunity of enjoying this happine&s;s eternally! O, then, under what high obliga|tions are <HI>men,</HI> are <HI>human creatures,</HI> to GOD, even for his creating goodne&s;s, who hath taught them more than the bea&s;ts of the field, made them wi&s;er than the fowls of heaven, &s;tampt upon their nature the image of his own immortality, and made them capable of eternally enjoying the <HI>chief good?</HI> But, (2.) We mu&s;t con&s;ider that the <HI>only opportunity</HI> which we have of en&s;uring the eternal enjoyment of the chief good of our natures, is our <HI>pre&s;ent, &s;canty, uncertain &s;pan of time.</HI> When the cur|tain of time falls, all opportunity cea&s;es of either <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>receiving</HI> that good, which will be eternal in its fruits, con&s;equences and rewards: For, when the night of death cometh, no man can work the rewardable works of GOD; there is no knowledge, device or repentance in the grave. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e we are probation|ary creatures, and our pre&s;ent precarious exi&s;tence, is the only time of our trial. Hence it appears, how <HI>all-important</HI> time is to us, as our <HI>eternal all</HI> depends on the manner in which we improve our &s;hort allotment of it. It is our &s;eed time for eternity. It is our work|ing, labouring day, wherein we are to lay up in &s;tore a good foundation for the time to come. It is our only opportunity of providing for, and en&s;uring a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. (3.) Hence it will follow, that
<PB N="240" REF="014137_0239_0F97D4BAF4984B60">as this is the talent which gives worth to all other ta|lents, every day or hour of it abu&s;ed, or not u&s;ed in &s;ub&s;erviency to our eternal intere&s;ts, though it may not totally deprive us of <HI>eternal happine&s;s it&s;elf,</HI> yet it will certainly le&s;&s;en the <HI>degree of that happine&s;s.</HI> He who, with <HI>one pound,</HI> gained <HI>ten,</HI> was made ruler over <HI>ten cities;</HI> and he who gained but <HI>two,</HI> was made ruler only over <HI>two</HI> cities. A plain proof, that a vigorous improve|ment of <HI>this,</HI> and every other talent, will be proporti|onably rewarded; and that the more &s;lothful and idle &s;ervant (though he may not be altogether unfaithful) will fall &s;hort of the reward which he might have ob|tained by diligence and circum&s;pection.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLIX. <HI>The</HI> CONSIDERATION <HI>of</HI> ETERNITY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ETERNITY, what a <HI>va&s;t, amazing, unfa|thomable, incomprehen&s;ible</HI> &s;ubject! It is the <HI>exi&s;|tence</HI> and <HI>duration</HI> of him, who is incomprehen&s;ible to all but him&s;elf!&mdash;As we quickly lo&s;e all our ideas in con&s;i|dering <HI>immen&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>infinite &s;pace;</HI>&mdash;&s;o we are equally lo&s;t in con&s;idering <HI>eternity,</HI> or <HI>infinite duration;</HI> and no wonder, &s;ince they are in &s;ome &s;ort attributes of the <HI>incomprehen|&s;ible</HI> JEHOVAH, which none by &s;earching can find out unto perfection!</P>
<P N="2">2. THE word <HI>aion,</HI> which we Engli&s;h <HI>eternity,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>perpetual exi&s;tence;</HI> and &s;ince we are finite creatures, it is little wonder, that we &s;hould be incapable of forming any adequate conception of it: For, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, that a being who has <HI>begun to exi&s;t,</HI> &s;hould be able to conceive the nature of a being who is <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent,</HI> and never had a beginning of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">3. ETERNITY is generally di&s;tingui&s;hed into two periods (if one many be allowed &s;o to expre&s;s it;) the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> is the eternity of duration which <HI>is pa&s;t,</HI> and which can be attributed only to GOD, who alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it all: The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> is that eternity of duration which flows on endle&s;sly from any given period of time. This la&s;t eter|nity is not peculiar to GOD, but is attributed al&s;o to all immortal creatures, &s;uch as <HI>angels, men</HI> and <HI>devils;</HI> who, though they have begun to exi&s;t, yet never &s;hall cea&s;e to be.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS la&s;t eternity, I mean the eternity of creatures, is not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> like the duration of GOD'S exi&s;tence; but wholly depending on the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>will of</HI> GOD, who
<PB N="243" REF="014137_0242_0F97D4BD364ECD30">has been plea&s;ed to form &s;ome of his creatures, for an exi&s;tence co-eval with him&s;elf; <HI>i.e.</HI> to <HI>will</HI> and <HI>cau&s;e</HI> their duration to be <HI>eternal.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. HOW wonderful a being is <HI>that</HI> GOD, who is eter|nal in his duration, and immen&s;ely unlimited in his ex|i&s;tence! his <HI>duration</HI> and his <HI>being</HI> admit of no limits, and therefore admit of no kind of compari&s;on with the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> or <HI>duration</HI> of any created being.</P>
<P N="6">6. HOW entirely are we dependent on GOD, from who&s;e <HI>nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence,</HI> we have borrowed our <HI>limited exi&s;tence;</HI> and by the very power of who&s;e will, we con|tinue to exi&s;t every moment?</P>
<P N="7">7. THOUGH <HI>ab&s;olute eternity</HI> belongs only to GOD, yet as we &s;hare in all that eternity which is before us, and mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable through this endle&s;s dura|tion, according as we &s;pend our pre&s;ent time; it follows that we &s;hould live here below, with a con&s;tant habitu|al view and regard to our eternal exi&s;tence and dura|tion.</P>
<P N="8">8. THIS will enable us upon all occa&s;ions to form a proper e&s;timate of things. For, if any <HI>temporary</HI> or <HI>momentary</HI> plea&s;ures, honours or gains, which would rob us of eternal happine&s;s, &s;hould &s;olicit our attention or pur&s;uit, they ought, at all events, to be forborne and rejected.&mdash;And if any <HI>temporary</HI> &s;ufferings or &s;elf-denials, which are nece&s;&s;ary to our eternal happine&s;s, &s;hould fall in our way, they &s;hould at all adventures, be endured rather than we &s;hould run the ri&s;k of &s;uffering eternal tor|ments: For, whatever of joy or pain is <HI>temporary,</HI> bears proportion to that which is <HI>eternal.</HI> And it is a maxim of eternal rea&s;on, that le&s;&s;er inconveniences ought al|ways to be preferred to greater; and that to <HI>&s;ell eternal happine&s;s</HI> for the plea&s;ures of a <HI>moment,</HI> yea, of <HI>ten mil|lions of years,</HI> argues de&s;perate folly.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY L. <HI>The</HI> DUTY <HI>of</HI> MASTERS <HI>of</HI> FAMILIES.</HEAD>
<P>MASTERS of families are pretty univer&s;ally al|lowed to &s;u&s;tain the offices of <HI>prophets, prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>kings</HI> in their own families, and if we borrow our ideas of the number and importance of the duties they owe to their families, from the &s;u&s;taining <HI>the&s;e three offices,</HI> their duty, in this relation, will appear very weighty and important indeed.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>prophet</HI> to <HI>in&s;truct;</HI> it is there|fore the bu&s;ine&s;s of ma&s;ters of families, to in&s;truct their families, not only in the maxims of prudential wi&s;dom, but more e&s;pecially in the doctrines and duties of reli|gion.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT will not excu&s;e parents in the neglect of this duty, that they are <HI>ignorant</HI> them&s;elves. They ought to <HI>learn</HI> and get knowledge for this very purpo&s;e. And there are few, but if they take due pains, may acquire knowledge enough, to give <HI>good, whole&s;ome</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in&s;tructions to their hou&s;holds.</P>
<P N="3">3. IGNORANT and unlearned parents &s;hould be the more con&s;cientious in providing proper in&s;tructors for their families.</P>
<P N="4">4. PARENTS may in&s;truct their families very u&s;efully and effectually by &s;etting before them blamele&s;s, virtuous and religious examples; and the be&s;t in&s;tructions without this, will be very <HI>ineffectual,</HI> if not perni|cious.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF it is the duty of <HI>kings</HI> to give good laws, and to pre&s;erve good order among their &s;ubjects; ma&s;ters of families are obliged to do this in their families.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="245" REF="014137_0244_0F97D4BEB4C8D140">
6. THE orders and regulations of ma&s;ters of families, in their families, &s;hould not be more numerous than is nece&s;&s;ary, le&s;t they be neglected or forgotten through the multiplicity of them; and their nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be <HI>made apparent,</HI> that they may be enforced with firmne&s;s and re&s;olution.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the government of a family (a &s;ociety often made up of per&s;ons of very different tempers and di&s;po|&s;itions) great prudence, &s;kill and attention are needful, and above all, the divine coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT appears to be of ill con&s;equence for the ruler of a family, to give way to the petulency or unrea&s;onable humours of a capricious dome&s;tic; as this would be implicitly giving up his prerogative, and fo&s;tering ill humours, and rebellious, lawle&s;s di&s;po&s;itions in the &s;ub|ject. It belongs to Chri&s;tian prudence to determine when this rule ought to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, in order to prevent greater evils.</P>
<P N="9">9. LENITY, <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> &s;hould be tempered with <HI>firmne&s;s, &s;teadine&s;s</HI> and <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> in him, who would govern a family well. Tyranny in little dome&s;tic &s;o|cieties, is odious; and too much lenity may produce great evils.</P>
<P N="10">10. BODILY <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> &s;hould be the la&s;t expedient u&s;ed to reform or correct a dome&s;tic offender; and pru|dence alone can point out the proper time and place for this.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE good example of a king is equally binding with his laws, and far more encouraging and alluring; &s;o it is in the ma&s;ter of a family.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE chief duties of a <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> are <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> and <HI>in|terce&s;&s;ion.</HI> This points out the obligation of <HI>praver,</HI> as a duty incumbent on all ma&s;ters of families, in their own families.</P>

<P N="1">1. AS we are, by nature, and by the prevailing in|fluence of evil example, exceeding prone to &s;in; and as temptations to it are &s;cattered thick in our way, &s;o to re&s;i&s;t temptations to evil, is certainly the mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> part of our Chri&s;tian duty and warfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE difficulty of our re&s;i&s;ting a temptation, is in proportion to our natural or habitual pronene&s;s to the particular &s;in to which we are tempted, and the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of our virtue or grace, taken together.</P>
<P N="3">3. A PERSON who has been, by <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> and may &s;till be by <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> exceeding prone to &s;ome particular &s;in; yet, by improvement in virtue and &s;trength of grace, may much more ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;t a temp|tation to that particular &s;in, than another per&s;on of weaker grace and feebler virtue, who is, and has been naturally and con&s;titutionally le&s;s inclined to that &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOME very vicious and wicked per&s;ons, have little inclination to &s;ome certain &s;ins, and therefore are in le&s;s danger of being tempted to commit them than others of much better di&s;po&s;itions upon the whole; yet who&s;e unhappine&s;s it is, to be naturally prone to tho&s;e &s;ins, and ea&s;ily drawn into them.</P>
<P N="5">5. WORLDLY-MINDED, <HI>covetous</HI> per&s;ons, are not ea|&s;ily tempted to the &s;ins of idlene&s;s, gaming, &s;quander|ing or luxury, and but &s;eldom have any &s;trong propen|&s;ity
<PB N="248" REF="014137_0247_0F97D4C0F53A5BA8">to carnal, &s;en&s;ual indulgences, or the &s;ins of the fle&s;h; becau&s;e, all the&s;e oppo&s;e and tend to de&s;troy their ruling pa&s;&s;ion, which is the love and pur&s;uit of gain. But they are prone to the &s;ins of lying for gain, of cheating, over-reaching, inju&s;tice, u&s;ury, cruelty, op|pre&s;&s;ion, and immoderate worldly cares, hazards and toils; and again&s;t the&s;e their &s;tronge&s;t watch and guard &s;hould be placed: For, it is but a vain and emp|ty boa&s;t, for a covetous man to &s;ay, <Q>I am no game|&s;ter, prodigal, or &s;pendthrift; no carele&s;s, &s;lothful man.</Q> The world knows he is not, cannot be &s;uch, in con&s;i&s;tence with his ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and that care, diligence and frugality in him, are only mini&s;ters and hand-maids of his capital vice.</P>
<P N="6">6. ANGRY, <HI>envious, malicious, revengeful</HI> per&s;ons; as al&s;o, <HI>vain, boa&s;ting, ambitious</HI> men, are &s;eldom prone to the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, or the &s;oft, &s;ocial, effeminate vices. This is not the complexion of their nature, or the ca&s;t of their corruption. Their ruling pa&s;&s;ion leads them to other objects, and renders them an ea&s;y prey to a dif|ferent &s;et of temptations. Therefore it is little virtue in them, to be free from a &s;et of &s;ins, to which they have naturally &s;o little propen&s;ity.</P>
<P N="7">7. THOSE who are extremely addicted to the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, are often free from the &s;ins of <HI>pride, vanity, ambition, malice, covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>revenge;</HI>&mdash;not becau&s;e they are <HI>virtuous,</HI> but becau&s;e they have no &s;trong bia&s;s towards the&s;e &s;ins, and becau&s;e the current of their cor|ruptions hurries them another way, and leads them to different objects. It would therefore be an empty boa&s;t in <HI>&s;uch a per&s;on,</HI> to &s;ay, <Q>I am ju&s;t in my commercial dealings, ea&s;y in my temper, affable in my deport|ment, kind, charitable, and good natured to all,</Q>&mdash;be|cau&s;e the oppo&s;ite &s;ins do not cla&s;h or interfere with his <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> rule is, to &s;et the &s;tronge&s;t guard upon the weake&s;t avenue of our &s;oul, and again&s;t our mo&s;t powerful enemy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> rule is, to hold no deliber&aacute;te parley with this prevailing lu&s;t, nor ever to &s;pare or give it quarter, when it makes its a&s;&s;aults however artfully.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fourth</HI> rule is, to &s;hun tho&s;e thoughts, compa|nies and amu&s;ements, which we have found by experi|ence, to prove fuel to the &s;ins which mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fifth</HI> rule is, to pray and &s;trive in a &s;pecial man|ner again&s;t the&s;e particular &s;ins.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;ixth</HI> rule is, to con&s;ider the danger of falling under the power of the&s;e enemies, and the difficulty of recovering. To all the&s;e may be added, a</P>
<P>SEVENTH prudential maxim, namely, to keep our|&s;elves diligently employed in &s;ome hone&s;t calling or bu|&s;ine&s;s, which is a very powerful pre&s;ervative again&s;t temptation, as it cuts off tho&s;e occa&s;ions and opportu|nities which mini&s;ter to it.</P>
<P N="9">9. TEMPTATIONS may turn to the advantage of tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t them many ways:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As conque&s;t over them is a proof of grace, and ground of joy.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) As every conque&s;t of this kind &s;trengthens the habit of virtue; gives courage and magnanimity to the
<PB N="250" REF="014137_0249_0F97D4C273BDBE28">&s;oul, and renders future victories over the &s;ame enemy more ea&s;y.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) As it renders tho&s;e who have thus conquered, the better qualified to advi&s;e and &s;uccour tho&s;e that are tempted, and gives them a better right to do &s;o.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) As it &s;hews us experimentally the power put into our hands to conquer other temptations, and tends to humble and give us remor&s;e for not having availed our&s;elves of this power upon former occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) As it tends to beget gratitude in us towards that Being, by who&s;e grace alone we are enabled to conquer any temptation; and teaches us <HI>on whom</HI> to rely, and <HI>whence</HI> to draw our &s;uccours, in future trials. And,</P>
<P N="6">(6.) As it is beating the devil in the field of battle, depriving him of a triumph, and di&s;couraging him from farther attempts upon us.</P>
<P N="10">10. WE may make the re&s;i&s;ting of temptations u&s;e|ful to others, in various ways: As, (1.)

On &s;ome occa&s;ions it may be lawful and u&s;eful to encourage and &s;upport the tottering virtue of others, by informing them of our &s;ucce&s;s; or by relating it under the fictiti|ous name of &s;ome third per&s;on: As, <Q>I have known a per&s;on, who was thus tempted, and thus re&s;i&s;ted.</Q> (3.) If the temptation is of <HI>a public kind,</HI> he who re&s;i&s;ts it, preaches a loud &s;ermon again&s;t vice; and it is much if &s;ome one or more, in company, are not benefited by it. (4.)

<HEAD>ESSAY LIV. TEMPTATIONS <HI>ari&s;ing from</HI> COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is generally allowed, that we take in mo&s;t temptations by the ear, or by the &s;en&s;e of hear|ing; and if &s;o, we are expo&s;ed to numberle&s;s temptati|ons in company: E&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider, that the eye comes in, in aid of the ear, and often helps on the&s;e temptations.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS is occa&s;ioned by the univer&s;al corruption and degeneracy of human nature, and by the con&s;equent carnal, earthly, impure nature of the pa&s;&s;ions and affec|tions, and the ungovernable licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the tongue which is actuated by tho&s;e inward, irregular and im|pure movements of the &s;oul. Human &s;ociety, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, may be compared to a <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> where all are weak and di&s;ea&s;ed, and where, by a &s;preading con|tagion, every one more or le&s;s infects another, and in|crea&s;es his weakne&s;s and di&s;order: So, that every mem|ber of it, is more or le&s;s infected and contaminated by others. No two can a&s;&s;ociate together, who are in a &s;tate of perfect health and &s;oundne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. UPON the whole, the <HI>wi&s;er</HI> and <HI>more virtuous</HI> our company is, the le&s;s will we be expo&s;ed to tempations of any kind;&mdash;and it may happen, that in many occa|&s;ional interviews with wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;ons, all may, upon the whole, be made better.&mdash;This effect might be expected from religious &s;ocieties and conferences, were they rightly conducted.&mdash;But we now chiefly mean, the <HI>common</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> interviews of mankind with each other, at <HI>entertainments, complimental vi&s;its, parties of

<P N="4">4. ONE of the fir&s;t temptations ari&s;ing from com|pany, which we &s;hall mention, is to <HI>error.</HI> It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;pend an hour in any company where <HI>religion, morality,</HI> or matters of <HI>human prudence</HI> are the topics, but &s;ome pernicious <HI>error</HI> is broached and maintained by &s;ome, and imbibed and embraced by others. <HI>Fal&s;e maxims</HI> are &s;o exceeding common in the world, and &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;pou&s;ed, and adhered to by the multi|tude, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;teer clear of them in any company; and many of them &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;o plau&s;ible, as well as recommended by ge|neral practice, that the weak and inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;iderate readi|ly &s;wallow them, and he mu&s;t be a re&s;olute per&s;on in|deed, who will dare to controvert them:&mdash;For in|&s;tance,&mdash;<Q>That it is lawful to hate and per&s;ecute our enemy, and take private revenge.

<P N="5">5. COMPANY tempts to <HI>levity.</HI> In the gaiety of conver&s;ation we are often led in&s;en&s;ibly away from that &s;obriety and temperance of mind (if we may &s;o &s;peak) which always becomes creatures in our circum|&s;tances. <HI>Puns, fla&s;hes of wit, humour,</HI> and a thou&s;and hints &s;tarted in almo&s;t every mixed company, <HI>intoxi|cate</HI> and <HI>inebriate</HI> the mind, and render it <HI>volatile</HI> and <HI>un|guarded.</HI> And this is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e, where <HI>good nature</HI> prevails, and <HI>good cheer</HI> abounds; where the minds of all are opened by mutual love and good cheer, and under no re&s;traint or re&s;erve. Per&s;ons
<PB N="259" REF="014137_0258_0F97D4C9F5F73368">in this &s;ituation are often &s;o far hurried off their guard, as to violate the laws of good morals, either by bear|ing too hard upon the weakne&s;s or good nature of &s;ome per&s;on in company;&mdash;by expo&s;ing or ridiculing &s;ome ab&s;ent per&s;on, or by &s;mutty je&s;ts and double <HI>entendres,</HI> offen&s;ive to the mode&s;t ear, and prejudicial to all.&mdash; And when the&s;e come al&s;o to be aided by <HI>immode&s;t looks,</HI> or <HI>ge&s;tures,</HI> and &s;o, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;on the <HI>eye,</HI> as well as the <HI>ear,</HI>&mdash;morality mu&s;t receive a dangerous would, and corruption be propagated.</P>

Scripture is often quoted with a <HI>levity</HI> and <HI>indi&s;|cretion,</HI> which betrays a great irreverence for it. The great doctrines of religion are di&s;puted and controverted, with an angry warmth, or a flippant lightne&s;s, which tends to di&s;credit them both in our own minds, and in the minds of others. The names of GOD and CHRIST, <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>hell, &s;alvation</HI> and <HI>damnation,</HI> are bandied about as the meere&s;t trifles. Di&s;re&s;pectful and unbe|lieving hints are often uttered, in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;content, again&s;t doctrines or duties, which we do not like, and which cro&s;s the grain of our corrupt nature: All which tend to de&s;troy our reverence for holy things, an eraze the very foundations of practi|cal &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and piety.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE do not now &s;peak of tho&s;e companies and &s;o|cieties where <HI>profanity,</HI> and <HI>irreligion</HI> are the profe&s;&s;ed topics of conver&s;ation; nor of tho&s;e &s;chools of debau|chery and &s;en&s;uality, where per&s;ons meet for the pur|po&s;es of <HI>drunkenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>lewdne&s;s.</HI> At &s;uch places per|&s;ons &s;eek temptations, and not temptations per&s;ons.

<P N="8">8. COMPANY tempts to a &s;inful mi&s;pen&s;e of time, in idle and unprofitable di&s;cour&s;e. The danger of com|pany would be &s;till le&s;s than it is, if the conver&s;ation could be confined to &s;omething <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>profitable</HI> of any kind, though it did not turn much on matters of morality or religion;&mdash;&s;uch as <HI>hi&s;tory, geography,</HI> the <HI>laws and cu&s;toms of nations,</HI> the <HI>improvement of trade, hu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an|dry, navigation,</HI> and the other <HI>arts and &s;ciences:</HI> But to the &s;candal of mo&s;t companies, the conver&s;ation generally turns upon <HI>mere non&s;en&s;ical bagatelles;</HI> degenerates into <HI>empty chit chat</HI> upon the verie&s;t trifles, where the hearers have a chance to learn nothing but the mo&s;t imperti|nent non&s;en&s;e, and where the &s;peakers mu&s;t run into the &s;ame in&s;ipid non&s;en&s;e, if they would be heard. <HI>Thus,</HI> much precious time is often thrown away in <HI>tho&s;e idle words,</HI> for which men mu&s;t give a &s;erious account at the la&s;t day;&mdash;that fooli&s;h talking and je&s;ting which is not convenient, by which guilt is contracted, and a habit of trifling acquired.</P>
<P N="9">9. BACKBITING, <HI>calumny</HI> and <HI>detraction,</HI> are other temptations frequently met with in company.

And while appeals are every moment made to you for the

<P N="10">10. THE be&s;t methods of &s;hunning the temptations ari&s;ing from company, are, (1.) For ordinary to fre|quent and a&s;&s;ociate with the be&s;t companies: For, man being a &s;ocial creature, cannot well be wholly without company.&mdash;(2.) When we accidentally or on bu&s;ine&s;s fall into company of a wor&s;e kind, to endeavour as far as our influence will reach, to give the conver&s;a|tion a profitable, or, at lea&s;t, an innocent turn and di|rection.&mdash;(3.) Where we cannot do this, to be on our guard again&s;t unworthy compliances, and to di&s;counte|nance, as far as we can, trifling, profanity and immora|lity.&mdash;(4.) If we find our&s;elves unable to do this, and that we are in danger of &s;inful compliances, to make our &s;tay as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;(5.) To make reflections after retiring, on the temptations we have met with, and to fortify our minds again&s;t future dangers of the &s;ame kind.&mdash;(6.) To &s;hun, if po&s;&s;ible, for the future, tho&s;e companies, or kinds of company, in which we have met with temptations too &s;trong for our virtue and re&s;olution: And, (7.) which ought to have been mentioned <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> To aim our prayers and endeavours again&s;t the temptations of &s;ociety, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e companies, which, by the nature of our &s;ituation or bu|&s;ine&s;s in lie, we are obliged mo&s;t commonly to fre|quent.</P>

IT has been ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t <HI>hermits</HI> and <HI>re|clu&s;es,</HI> did greatly corrupt Chri&s;tianity; and that the monks and nuns of later ages, have been, generally &s;peaking, a very wicked kind of people, infamous for many great vices: For, by binding them&s;elves up un|der &s;olemn vows, to au&s;terities which GOD never en|joined, their corruptions have been the more outrageous, and they have been &s;uffered to fall into the vile&s;t abo|minations.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is remarkable, that the <HI>devil</HI> pur&s;ued our Savi|our to a wilderne&s;s, where he thought he could more ef|fectually ply his temptations again&s;t him, than in the &s;ociety of men. And the evil &s;pirit, in the parable, who left the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed man, is &s;aid to have wandered in <HI>&s;olitary</HI> and <HI>dry places,</HI> where he con&s;orted with many other &s;pirits. Nor is it unworthy of a remark here, that if there is any truth in <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ra&s;t,</HI> and the pranks and illu&s;ions of evil &s;pirits, they have generally prevailed in places <HI>little frequented</HI> and <HI>thinly peopled,</HI> and have fled places of concour&s;e in the &s;ociety of then.</P>
<P N="7">7. SOLITUDE often tempts men to &s;ins, through the advantage of &s;ecrecy, which they would be a&s;hamed to practi&s;e in human &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="8">8. SOLITUDE naturally generates melancholy, and clouds the mind with gloomy thoughts; thereby dark|ening and &s;poiling the judgment.</P>
<P N="9">9. RECLUSES, as they have little &s;ociety with the world, and know little of the force of the&s;e temptations
<PB N="264" REF="014137_0263_0F97D4CDB399E278">which accompany a &s;ocial life, &s;o they are naturally prone to an over-rigid, uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition of mind, and cen&s;orious reflections on the actions and conduct of tho&s;e who are engaged in active, &s;ocial life.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE <HI>devil,</HI> ever vigilant and active to &s;educe rati|onal creatures, when he cannot get the advantage over them, by the temptations which ari&s;e from &s;ociety, of|ten drives them into &s;ullen &s;olitude; puts them out of temper with the world, and the proper duties of life, and there pur&s;ues them with <HI>bla&s;phemous &s;ugge&s;tions, un|clean thoughts,</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate re&s;olutions.</HI> And it has been generally ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e whom he drives to <HI>&s;elf-murder,</HI> have been long haters of &s;ociety, and lovers of &s;olitude and retirement.</P>
<P N="11">11. UPON the whole. To &s;hun &s;ociety le&s;t we fall into temptation, is not only rank cowardice, but al&s;o very ab&s;urd. There are proper times and occa&s;ions when we &s;hould &s;eek &s;olitude, and when retirement is both nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful; but we &s;hould con&s;ider the proper duties of our &s;tations as <HI>men</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and never fly &s;ociety when we have a chance of either doing or getting good by it.</P>

<P N="8">8.

<P N="1">1. THE be&s;t morali&s;ts have condemned &s;ome fa|&s;hionable diver&s;ions, as unlawful in them|&s;elves. Such are games of <HI>hazard,</HI> and &s;ucce&s;s in which depends in a great mea&s;ure on <HI>lottery,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>cards, dice,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF there are any other diver&s;ions which are either directly &s;inful in them&s;elves, or lead unavoidably to the corruption of manners, the&s;e are wholly out of the que|&s;tion at pre&s;ent, as being in them&s;elves unlawful, and therefore forbidden to Chri&s;tians; &s;uch as rioting and drunkenne&s;s, chambering and wantonne&s;s, impure dalli|ances, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, effeminacy, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3.

Others are calculated to recreate and unbend the mind, &s;uch are <HI>che&s;s,</HI> and a number of others; and the&s;e &s;eem be&s;t adapted for tho&s;e who live an active, laborious, fatiguing life.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="271" REF="014137_0270_0F97D4D33848E7B0">
4. THE very words, <HI>diver&s;ions</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ements,</HI> point out the u&s;e and de&s;ign of the&s;e pa&s;times. They are only intended to unbend the mind, and refre&s;h the bo|dy and animal &s;pirits, that tho&s;e who u&s;e them may be the better fitted and qualified to di&s;charge the &s;erious, nece&s;&s;ary and important bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life; the care of the &s;oul and of the body.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM this notion of <HI>diver&s;ions, amu&s;ements</HI> or <HI>recrea|tions,</HI> we may learn many important le&s;&s;ons about the right choice, u&s;e and regulation of them. As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT is evident, that a life &s;pent in a continual, or almo&s;t perpetual round of diver&s;ions, mu&s;t be a <HI>wicked, ill &s;pent</HI> life. This is wholly to mi&s;employ life, and ne|glect the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of it; and that too, under the wicked notion, that it is innocent, proper and beneficial to do &s;o.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IF diver&s;ion or amu&s;ement may be properly con&s;idered as the <HI>phy&s;ic of life,</HI> by which the di&s;orders of the body and mind, contracted by an inten&s;e application to the &s;erious and proper bu&s;ine&s;s of it, are relieved and cured, and their vigour, &s;prightline&s;s and activity re&s;tor|ed, for a fre&s;h application: Then, to &s;pend one's life in a perpetual round of diver&s;ions, is as ab&s;urd and prepo|&s;terous, as though a per&s;on, neglecting all food, &s;hould live wholly upon phy&s;ic, under a pretence of pre&s;erving his health and vigour.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) IF habits are contracted by repeated act; then a life &s;pent in giddy diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements, mu&s;t in cour&s;e of time &s;o relax and effeminate both the body and mind, as to render them wholly unfit for any ap|plication to the &s;erious and important bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life; mu&s;t beget an inveterate habit of the wor&s;t kind of idlene&s;s; and, in &s;ine, mu&s;t turn per&s;ons, thus devoted to diver&s;ions, into meer <HI>whirligigs</HI> and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s drones,</HI> bur|dens and nui&s;ances to &s;ociety. A life of perpetual di|ver&s;ion,
<PB N="272" REF="014137_0271_0F97D4D50E4A5B10">ver&s;ion, is a life of perpetual intoxication; and per&s;ons devoted to it, are generally the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and mi&s;chie|vous members of &s;ociety. Witne&s;s perpetual dancers and game&s;ters.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) WHEN diver&s;ions are turned into the con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s of life, they wholly change their nature, and lo&s;e their good effects; they are &s;o far from unbending the mind, that they become its only burden; they are &s;o far from recreating and refre&s;hing the body, that they fatigue it, and exhau&s;t the animal &s;pirits; they are &s;o far from rendering the body vigorous, and the mind chearful, that they injure the health and &s;ink the &s;pirits. This is, with a witne&s;s, to make a toil of a plea&s;ure; and to turn that cordial drop, which makes life's bitter draught go glibly down, into a <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>deleterious poi|&s;on.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) IF the proper de&s;ign of diver&s;ions is, by refre&s;h|ing the body and recreating the mind, to render both more lively and vigorous, and thereby fit them for a more vigorous application to the proper, nece&s;&s;ary and important duties of life; then all &s;uch diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements as evidently tend to hurt the body or the mind, and ob&s;truct the proper end of diver&s;ions, mu&s;t needs be unlawful and &s;inful: And the &s;ame will hold true of lawful and innocent diver&s;ions continued too long at a time. Although <HI>gaming</HI> were innocent in it|&s;elf, yet it were extremely unlawful to &s;pend whole weeks, night and day, in that diver&s;ion, to the breaking of natural re&s;t, and thereby hurting both the body and mind, and to the neglect of all duties, civil, &s;ocial and religious. Although <HI>dancing</HI> may be innocent in it&s;elf, yet to &s;pend whole nights in that exerci&s;e, to the fa|tiguing of the body, neglecting all the duties of the fa|mily and clo&s;et, and unfitting per&s;ons for the proper bu|&s;ine&s;s of the next day, is certainly criminal and unlaw|ful.&mdash;For

<P N="6">6.

<P N="1">1. IMMORTALITY has &s;tamped an amazing value on man.

All the beau|ties, all the riches, all the &s;tupendous wonders of ma|terial nature are, in compari&s;on with it, le&s;s than no|thing, and vanity! If man con&s;idered this, would it not be more his endeavour to act up to the dignity of his nature?

<P N="2">2. THE moment in which a rational, immortal &s;pirit animates a human <HI>foetus,</HI> a &s;park is kindled which &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed.

<P N="3">3. THE birth of a child we deem to be but a trifling event, and look with <HI>indifference,</HI> perhaps with <HI>contempt,</HI> on the little, helple&s;s &s;tranger. But if we viewed it with the penetrating eye of rea&s;on; if we con&s;idered it as emerging from eternal night into life immortal;&mdash;as an heir of worlds unknown, and a candidate for an ever|la&s;ting &s;tate;&mdash;as a glimmering &s;park of being, ju&s;t &s;truck from nothing by the all-creating rock, which mu&s;t burn and flame on to eternity, when &s;uns and &s;tars have returned to their native darkne&s;s or non-entity;&mdash; which mu&s;t &s;urvive the funeral of nature, and live through the rounds of endle&s;s ages; which mu&s;t either ri&s;e from glory to glory, a&s;cending perfection's &s;cale by endle&s;s gradations, or &s;ink deeper and deeper into the bottom le&s;s aby&s;s of mi&s;ery, and to which its immortali|ty mu&s;t either prove an <HI>un&s;ufferable cur&s;e,</HI>&mdash;or a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing in|conceivable,</HI> according to the manner in which it &s;hall have acquitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;elf in its pre&s;ent probationary &s;tate&mdash; we &s;hall clearly di&s;cern, that the value and importance of a human infant can &s;carcely be computed.</P>

<P N="7">7. PARENTS, more e&s;pecially, are obliged to this duty by a number of the weightie&s;t motives and con&s;i|derations. (1.) They have been the immediate in&s;tru|ments of bringing their children into a tempting, in|&s;naring world, and have tran&s;mitted to them an heredi|tary taint of corruption, the &s;eed of guilt and of mi|&s;ery. (2.) Providence has &s;o ordered it, that children are long continued in a helple&s;s &s;tate under the care of their parents, that they may have a &s;ufficient time and opportunity to form them for u&s;efulne&s;s in this life, and glory in that which is to come; and has implanted a &s;trong <HI>&s;torge</HI> or <HI>natural affection</HI> in their hearts towards their children, which &s;hould powerfully prompt them to this duty. (3.)

<P N="8">8. THREE things &s;eem of prime importance in the education of children, <HI>in&s;truction, government</HI> and <HI>ex|ample.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) INSTRUCTION &s;hould be begun as &s;oon as chil|dren are capable of receiving it, which is generally very early in life. The plaine&s;t and mo&s;t practical truths &s;hould fir&s;t be in&s;tilled into the tender minds of children, and that in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t familiar manner, with
<PB N="281" REF="014137_0280_0F97D4DC4B1FAFD0">&s;uch a <HI>&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;olemnity</HI> as is not forbidding and di&s;|gu&s;ting, but which may rather convey <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>amu&s;e|ment</HI> to the mind. And parents ought to improve their own under&s;tandings, that they may be better qua|lified properly to in&s;truct their children; which is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to the wi&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IN the article of government, parents &s;hould at|tentively &s;tudy the tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of their children; as upon &s;ome ingenious tempers, gentle re|proofs will have a better effect than &s;tripes, and with others it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e <HI>&s;evere reproof,</HI> and the <HI>rod of correction.</HI> In government, it is be&s;t to begin with mildne&s;s in all children, as correction is a duty which is managed well with great difficulty: When correction is found nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould not be inflicted <HI>ra&s;hly,</HI> without duly weighing the <HI>nature</HI> of the crime and its true <HI>demerit.</HI> The greate&s;t &s;everity in puni&s;hing &s;hould be for <HI>immoralities; indi&s;cretions</HI> &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over with a light correction. A child &s;hould never be puni&s;hed for <HI>dullne&s;s</HI> or other <HI>natural infirmities.</HI> In cor|recting no &s;igns of <HI>revenge</HI> or <HI>violent pa&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;hould ever appear, but the child who is corrected &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible, that it is done with reluctance, and purely for its own good; and much care &s;hould be taken, to give it a deep conviction of the evil of the crime, for which it is cha&s;ti&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ALL the in&s;tructions and corrections of parents will avail nothing, but rather make matters wor&s;e, if their <HI>examples</HI> are <HI>vicious</HI> and <HI>immoral.</HI></P>

<P>IT &s;eems evident by the whole tenor of this epi&s;tle, that the holy and zealous Apo&s;tle had not a few enemies in the church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and tho&s;e too &s;uch as he might lea&s;t of all have expected&mdash;his fellow profe&s;|&s;ors and fellow-teachers of chri&s;tianity.

They repre&s;ented him to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> as mean and contemptible, as light and incon&s;tant, as proud, over|bearing and imperious, as a &s;ubverter of the law, yea, as a downright <HI>mad-men.</HI> They put a bad con&s;truction on all his words and actions, preferred them&s;elves be|fore

<P>SUCH treatment as this could not but greatly affect the good Apo&s;tle. not only as it tended to cool and weaken the affections of his beloved Corinthian con|verts towards him; but more e&s;pecially, as it was like|ly to prejudice their minds again&s;t the important doc|trines of the go&s;pel which he had, with great labour, zeal and &s;incerity, preached among&s;t them. And hence it is, that we find &s;o great a part of this epi&s;tle employ|ed in <HI>St. Paul's</HI> vindication of his own character and conduct, as an Apo&s;tle of CHRIST;&mdash;in reclaiming the <HI>Corinthian</HI> church from an undue attachment to the&s;e Judaizing teachers,&mdash;and in rekindling proper regards to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing and unadulterated doctrines of the go&s;pel, which he had, in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, propagated among&s;t them.</P>
<P>As that peculiar <HI>fervency</HI> and <HI>ardour</HI> with which this elo|quent Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles pro&s;ecuted the go&s;pel mi|ni&s;try, &s;eems to be one of the great quarrels which his enemies had again&s;t him, he makes a noble and &s;pirit|ed apology to the Corinthians for his conduct in this re&s;pect, from the 10th ver&s;e to the end of the chapter; alledging the <HI>grandeur</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> of the doctrines which the go&s;pel reveals, as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible zeal and importunity of addre&s;s.</P>
<P>AT the <HI>tenth ver&s;e</HI> he had laid down the certainty of a future judgment, in which all men mu&s;t appear be|fore the tribunal of CHRIST, to receive, every one, ac|cording to the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. And this he alledges as one powerful rea&s;on and motive of zeal and fervor in the go&s;pel mini&s;try: <HI>Know|ing therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the terrors of the</HI> LORD, <HI>we per&s;uade men;</HI> that is, being firmly a&s;&s;ured of a &s;trict and im|partial

<P N="1">I. I AM to &s;hew you the peculiar and &s;pecific nature of this love of CHRIST, and by what properties it is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and exalted above the love of mortals. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE will find, on the &s;malle&s;t reflection, that <HI>love</HI> is a certain mode or affection of the mind, drawing it forth with de&s;ire and complacency towards &s;ome ob|ject; and, including in it (according to the &s;cripture no|tion of it, and as it is exerci&s;ed from GOD to man) <HI>compa&s;&s;ion, benevolence</HI> and <HI>bounty.</HI></P>
<P>LOVE, as it exi&s;ts in us, be&s;ides its imperfection, has generally a great mixture of <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</HI> <Q>We are &s;en&s;i|ble of a penury and want in our own beings.</Q> We feel a dependance not only upon GOD, but al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure on our <HI>fellow-creatures,</HI> both for <HI>being</HI> and <HI>well-being.</HI> Our happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, is neither complete, nor independent, and therefore we <Q>&s;eek &s;ome augmentation of it, and &s;ome addition to it, by union with the objects we love.</Q> If we clo&s;ely and impartially examine the frame of our own nature, and the motives of our actions, we will find, that perhaps the mo&s;t pure and di&s;intere&s;ted acts of our love, bene|volence and charity, are mixed with &s;ome degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;Let even a wicked per&s;on, who has any re|mains of natural tenderne&s;s and humanity left in his brea&s;t, &s;ee a man who is an object of great pity and compa&s;&s;ion, his heart will melt towards him,&mdash;he will <HI>feel</HI> for his di&s;tre&s;s, and, if po&s;&s;ible, give him &s;ome &s;uccour or relief;&mdash;not perhaps from any hope of reward in this
<PB N="288" REF="014137_0287_0F97D4E13470A6F0">life, nor merely out of o&s;tentation, <HI>that he may be &s;een and prai&s;ed of men;</HI>&mdash;not out of any love to GOD, or obedi|ence to his command, nor from any pro&s;pect of a future reward&mdash;(the &s;uppo&s;ition excludes all &s;uch motives); but <HI>purely</HI> to relieve the anxious and &s;ympathetic feelings of his own brea&s;t. He relieves the mi&s;erable, that he him&s;elf may be le&s;s mi&s;erable. He endeavours to mi|tigate the pain of his &s;uffering and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow-crea|ture, that he him&s;elf may be le&s;s pained and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. And although good and truly virtuous and gracious men may have <HI>nobler</HI> and <HI>purer</HI> motives of their charity, yet it is much to be que&s;tioned, whether &s;omething of &s;elf-intere&s;t may not mix it&s;elf with their mo&s;t di&s;inte|re&s;ted actions.</P>
<P>I AM far, indeed, from condemning this natural &s;ym|pathy and compa&s;&s;ion, &s;o deeply implanted in the hu|man heart, by the GOD <HI>of nature,</HI> for the &s;uccour and relief of our fellow-men. I only mention this in proof of what I have advanced, namely, <Q>That human love or charity, in the pure&s;t in&s;tances of it, is not perhaps wholly di&s;intere&s;ted: Either <HI>glory,</HI> or <HI>fame,</HI> or <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> or <HI>profit,</HI> or <HI>commodity,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>intere&s;ted &s;elfi&s;h</HI> motive or obligation &s;o mix them&s;elves with the mo&s;t <HI>generous heroic</HI> acts of our love and charity, as to bla&s;t their preten&s;ions to <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s,</HI> and greatly to impair their merit.</Q></P>
<P>BUT now <Q>the love of CHRIST is not this way excit|ed.

<P>AGREEABLE to all this;&mdash;when &s;inners are <HI>converted,</HI> or turned from <HI>error</HI> and <HI>vice,</HI> to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> they are &s;aid to have <HI>their eyes opened;</HI> their <HI>under&s;tandings en|lightened,</HI> and to be <HI>brought from darkne&s;s to light,</HI> and from the power of &s;atan to GOD: And GOD is &s;aid to <HI>bring them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light.</HI> <Q>Ye were &s;ometime darkne&s;s, (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) but now are ye light in the Lord.</Q></P>

<P>ST. PAUL had founded a church in <HI>Philippi,</HI> which wor&s;hipped the true GOD, and received the LORD JE|SUS CHRIST, while many of their brethren and fellow-citizens, &s;till continued in their idolatry and infidelity. It was, therefore, the de&s;ire and ambition of the good Apo&s;tle, that the converted <HI>Philippians</HI> &s;hould labour for the conver&s;ion of their heathen brethren. He de&s;ired, that the unbelieving and idolatrous <HI>Philippians,</HI> (who were attentive and malicious ob&s;ervers of their Chri&s;tian brethren, becau&s;e of the new religion they had embra|ced, and the new kind of life they had devoted them|&s;elves to) &s;hould &s;ee nothing in them, but what was <HI>wi&s;e, reputable,</HI> and of <HI>good report;</HI> and <HI>&s;uch as becometh the go&s;pel of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>THIS, however, it &s;eems had not been the ca&s;e, &s;o much as the good Apo&s;tle wi&s;hed. The&s;e <HI>young converts</HI> although they had broke off from the idolatry and infi|delity of their neighbours, yet were &s;till of very imper|fect characters, in point of morality:&mdash;Although they had embraced the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity; yet they had not fully imbib'd its &s;pirit and temper. However &s;ound they might be in <HI>faith,</HI> yet they lacked that <HI>charity,</HI> which is the bond of <HI>perfectne&s;s,</HI> and without which true Chri&s;tianity, cannot either <HI>live</HI> or <HI>move</HI> or have <HI>its being.</HI> No &s;ooner had they broke off from their unbelieving and idolatrous brethren, than they began to quarrel among them&s;elves. This &s;eems to have been the true ground and motive, of the Apo&s;tle's noble and excellent exhor|tation, in our text; which will ever be equally u&s;eful, and equally applicable, while Chri&s;tianity has a being in a corrupt, imperfect, world and &s;tate.</P>
<P><Q>Do all things, (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) without mur|murings and di&s;putings: That ye may be blamele&s;s and harmle&s;s, the &s;ons of GOD, without, &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P>ARE there any among&s;t us, <HI>my brethren,</HI> who have the noble ambition, not only of obtaining this heavenly feli|city our&s;elves, but al&s;o of leading others in the &s;ame road?

<P>THIS &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle might be ea&s;ily <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trated,</HI> by con&s;idering the <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>morals</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> among&s;t which the primitive Chri&s;tians lived, to whom he here writes. The character which our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles have left us on record, both of the Jews and Gentiles of that age, (and which is abundantly confirmed by contempo|rary writers) makes it appear, that they were, indeed, "a crooked and perver&s;e generation."</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;carcely the very &s;hadow of religion left among&s;t them in that abandoned age. The mea|&s;ure of their iniquity &s;eems then to have been <HI>filled,</HI> and they were <HI>ripe for de&s;truction.</HI> To the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> the 'mo&s;t <HI>numerous</HI> and re&s;pectable &s;ect among&s;t them, our Saviour thus addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf&mdash;<Q>Ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnati|on of hell?</Q> And, as to the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> they were men of <HI>athei&s;tical principles,</HI> and dete&s;table morals.</P>

<P>IT were ea&s;y, <HI>my brethren,</HI> to multiply quotations to this purpo&s;e; but &s;urely evidence enough has been pro|duced to prove, that the world, in which Chri&s;tians live; or, that that company of men with which the church is contra&s;ted, and from which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed every where in &s;cripture, is <Q>a crooked and perver&s;e genera|tion.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LXI. THE AGGRAVATED GUILT OF MURDER: A SERMON FROM EXODUS XX. 13.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Thou &s;halt not kill.</HEAD>
<P>IT may perhaps be deemed a little un&s;ea&s;onable and impolite to handle a &s;ubject of this kind, before a civilized and chri&s;tianized a&s;&s;embly. Methinks, I hear &s;ome of my hearers object, and &s;ay, <Q>You pay us but a rude and unwelcome compliment, by even &s;uppo&s;ing us capable of committing &s;uch an atrocious and un|natural crime as this. Murder! The &s;hedding of in|nocent blood! Our blood runs chill, and freezes at the very thought of it. No; GOD forbid! Our hearts are too tender and humane ever to harbour &s;uch a de&s;ign, or li&s;ten to &s;uch a temptation!</Q></P>
<P>THERE was a time, <HI>my hearers,</HI> when mo&s;t murderers could doubtle&s;s have &s;aid all this, with as much <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>&s;incerity</HI> as any of us now can, and when their very
<PB N="329" REF="014137_0328_0F97D3F5B4FE7F70">&s;ouls would have &s;huddered at the thoughts of com|mitting &s;o great a wickedne&s;s. But there was al&s;o a time when the increa&s;ed &s;trength of their corruptions hurried them on to commit it with greedine&s;s, and un|der the mo&s;t aggravated circum&s;tances of guilt.</P>
<P>ALAS! we little know the <HI>deceitfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate wickedne&s;s</HI> of our own hearts, or the <HI>depth</HI> and <HI>inveteracy</HI> of our corruptions, when we imagine our&s;elves above the danger or po&s;&s;ibility of committing the greate&s;t and mo&s;t atrocious crimes. <Q>The heart (&s;ays the pro|phet) is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked; who can know it? It &s;tarts a&s;ide like a broken bow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>WE look upon murder, (and ju&s;tly) as the mo&s;t atrocious crime which can be committed by man&mdash;we have no compa&s;&s;ion for the per&s;ons of murderers, but regard them as <HI>mon&s;ters of iniquity,</HI> who have even no claim to <HI>human pity:</HI>&mdash;But I am per&s;uaded, <HI>my friends,</HI> that nothing but the re&s;training grace of GOD, prevents multitudes, who are thus <HI>mercile&s;s</HI> in their judgment of others, from committing the very &s;ame crime. <Q><HI>Cruel man!</HI>&mdash;Thou ha&s;t no mercy on thy fellow-&s;inner!&mdash; Thou thinke&s;t him unworthy the pity either of GOD or man!&mdash;Thou deeme&s;t it impo&s;&s;ible for thee to fall into the &s;ame wickedne&s;s!&mdash;Yet thou art <HI>proud, imperi|ous, intolerant</HI> and <HI>unforgiving!</HI> Yet thy &s;oul often <HI>boils, ferments,</HI> and <HI>rankles</HI> with the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>anger, fury, re|venge, envy,</HI> and <HI>malice prepen&s;e</HI> again&s;t thy neighbour! Yet thou praye&s;t for his damnation, and devi&s;e&s;t evil again&s;t him, and wi&s;he&s;t him dead, becau&s;e he &s;tands in the way of &s;ome gratification, or has wounded thy imaginary honour, or hurt thy pride! Be it known unto thee, <HI>O blind</HI> and <HI>mercile&s;s man,</HI> that <HI>thou art the very murderer</HI> whom thou condemne&s;t without pity;
<PB N="330" REF="014137_0329_0F97D3F675392EE0">and that nothing but &s;ome <HI>prudential motive,</HI> or rather, the <HI>re&s;training grace of</HI> GOD, bridling thine outrageous pa&s;&s;ions, for the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of human &s;ociety, prevents thee from perpetrating the very fact thy&s;elf, which thou thinke&s;t <HI>unpardonable</HI> in <HI>another.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thou &s;halt not kill, <HI>&s;ays GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be paying a bad compliment to the under|&s;tandings of my hearers, to take up much of your time in &s;hewing you&mdash;That there are many circum&s;tances, wherein the taking away of human life, is not to be deemed <HI>&s;inful</HI> or <HI>criminal;</HI>&mdash;&s;uch as <HI>chance-medly,</HI> when one man takes away the life of another, by <HI>mere acci|dent,</HI> without any <HI>knowledge</HI> or <HI>de&s;ign</HI> in the action;&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>man-&s;laughter, on one's own defence,</HI> when a man from a principle of <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> is, as it were, compelled to take away the life of another who a&s;&s;aults him unpro|voked, in order to &s;ave his own. The &s;ame al&s;o hap|pens in <HI>a lawful, defen&s;ive war,</HI> when men are forced to de&s;troy an invading enemy, in defence of their own lives, liberties and properties;&mdash;or, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> when men have for|feited their lives, by &s;uch crimes as e&s;&s;entially affect the public good and &s;afety, and which are adjudged worthy of death, by laws <HI>human and divine.</HI> In all the&s;e ca&s;es, and perhaps in &s;ome others, the taking away of human life, is &s;o far from being criminal, that it may be a duty which we owe to GOD, <HI>our neighbour</HI> and <HI>our&s;elves!</HI></P>
<P>THE crime therefore <HI>here</HI> forbidden by GOD, and which is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed in the Engli&s;h lan|guage by the word murder, is the <HI>&s;hedding of innocent blood;</HI> &mdash;or <Q>wilfully and feloniou&s;ly killing of another, upon prepen&s;ed malice; whether &s;ecretly or openly; whether our&s;elves, or by others.</Q> And this prepen&s;ed malice, is either, (1.) Expre&s;s, when it may be evidently proved, that there was ill-will;&mdash;or, (2.) Implied; when one kills another &s;uddenly, having nothing to de|fend
<PB N="331" REF="014137_0330_0F97D3F7347C3BC8">him&s;elf: For, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the law ju&s;tly pre|&s;umes, that there mu&s;t have been <HI>malice.&mdash;To this</HI> may al&s;o be added, the atrocious crime of <HI>&s;uicide,</HI> or a man's laying violent hands upon him&s;elf;&mdash;as al&s;o, <HI>duelling,</HI> which contains in it the e&s;&s;ence and guilt of both the above crimes.</P>
<P>IN farther improving this &s;ubject, I &s;hall, I. <HI>A little</HI> expo&s;e the heinous and and aggravated guilt of murder. &mdash;II. Shew you that it is a crime ju&s;tly puni&s;hable by death.&mdash;III. Endeavour to expo&s;e tho&s;e <HI>pa&s;&s;ions, tempers</HI> and <HI>practices</HI> which lead to it. I am,</P>
<P N="1">I. A LITTLE to open and <HI>expo&s;e</HI> the <HI>heinous</HI> and <HI>aggravated guilt</HI> of murder. And this may be &s;hown 1&s;t, From the very <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>con&s;equences</HI> of the crime it&s;elf; and, 2dly, From the light in which both the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, and the <HI>con&s;ciences of men</HI> repre&s;ent it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the very nature and con&s;equences of the crime it&s;elf. (1.) Man is fearfully and wonderfully made; <HI>made,</HI> we are told, in the <HI>image</HI> and <HI>likene&s;s</HI> of GOD. Man is GOD'S offspring and <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> on this earth. His body is, perhaps, the noble&s;t piece of divine workman&s;hip; and GOD, when he had made it, breathed into it the breath of life, and made it <HI>a living</HI> and <HI>intelligent image</HI> of <HI>him&s;elf!</HI> Now to break to pieces this <HI>living temple;</HI>&mdash;to <HI>deface, undo,</HI> and, as much as in us is, <HI>wantonly to de&s;troy</HI> this workman&s;hip of GOD;&mdash; to &s;eparate this &s;oul and body whom GOD hath joined together;&mdash;to di&s;unite and take down this tabernacle, which GOD hath built and &s;et up, by a miracle of his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s;&mdash;what a <HI>daring</HI> crime? What an <HI>audacious</HI> wickedne&s;s? All our power, wi&s;dom and contrivance cannot give <HI>form, exi&s;tence</HI> or <HI>life</HI> to a
<PB N="332" REF="014137_0331_0F97D3F7F6274BE8">worm; and &s;hall we dare to de&s;troy a fellow-man? Shall we perfume to take away, in the wantonne&s;s of our pride and pa&s;&s;ion, that which all the powers on earth, and all the angels in haven cannot give?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT GOD <HI>makes nothing in vain,</HI> is a maxim not to be di&s;puted. Who knows the de&s;tiny of a human creature, or for what purpo&s;es Providence may have de&s;igned him? Pre&s;umptuous, &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals that we are, we are apt to pronounce a being worthle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s, on whom his Maker may &s;et much value, and by whom he may do great things! When we &s;ee <HI>Saul per&s;ecuting the church,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the &s;toning of <HI>Stephen,</HI> we may adjudge him worthy of death, and think the world would be well rid of &s;uch a mon&s;ter; yet this very <HI>Saul</HI> was <HI>a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el,</HI> who was to pro&s;e|lyte half the Roman empire to JESUS! How many wicked and worthle&s;s men, have become benefactors to the world and ornaments to humanity!</P>
<P>How many pe&s;ts to human &s;ociety have become fa|thers of children, who have done honour to human na|ture, and become the &s;aviours of their country?&mdash;This &s;hould reach us not to de&s;pi&s;e the meane&s;t of the crea|tures of GOD, or the wickede&s;t of men, who are &s;till in a place of repentance. But the murderer does what in him lies to defeat the de&s;igns of GOD'S providence, and cut off the purpo&s;es of his will. True, he can ne|ver effect this: <Q>GOD'S coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations: For there is neither wi&s;dom or device, or coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord!</Q>&mdash;Yet no thanks to the murderer for this&mdash; who, in the rage or wantonne&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ions, cuts off a human creature, who, for all he knew or con&s;idered, might have been appointed by GOD to an&s;wer the no|ble&s;t purpo&s;es, and to bring about the noble&s;t de&s;igns in the world!</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="014137_0332_0F97D3F8B4A74368">
<Q>CRUEL and inhuman mother!&mdash;Knowe&s;t thou how u&s;eful, how worthy, how ornamental a member of &s;ociety, that child might have proved, whom thou art now about to <HI>&s;trangle</HI> or <HI>abandon</HI> to certain death;&mdash;to what honours, to what happine&s;s, to what u&s;efulne&s;s, to what degrees of future glory it might have been advanced!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Vile and <HI>&s;avage barbarian,</HI> who, for the &s;lighte&s;t provocation, or to gratify the mo&s;t diaboli|cal revenge, art ju&s;t about to plunge the murderous &s;teel into thy neighbour's bowels, or to level him to the earth by a leaden death!&mdash;Stop thy hand, till thou ha&s;t con&s;idered, That thou art now about to rob helple&s;s children, of a father&mdash;a helple&s;s wife, of her provider&mdash;the poor and needy, of a helper&mdash;his friends, of a friend, and the world, perhaps, of a more u&s;eful member of &s;ociety than thy worthle&s;s &s;elf!</Q></P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE chief end and de&s;ign of this world and &s;tate is, that men &s;hould prepare and provide for a bet|ter, and an eternal world. Human life was given chiefly for this purpo&s;e, and would be worth nothing on any other &s;uppo&s;ition. I may even affirm it, with confidence, that it would be unworthy of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD to create &s;uch a being as man, and to expo&s;e him to the many calamities and afflictions of this life, <HI>merely</HI> for the &s;mall portion of plea&s;ure and happine&s;s which he enjoys in it.</P>
<P>LIFE, <HI>human life,</HI> is a <HI>time</HI> and <HI>&s;pace</HI> of <HI>trial</HI> and <HI>proba|tion</HI> for eternity. In this view of it, human life is an <HI>invaluable trea&s;ure,</HI> and every moment of it is of the <HI>ut|mo&s;t importance!</HI> For this purpo&s;e the P&s;almi&s;t importu|nately prays; <Q>LORD, cut me not off in the mid&s;t of my days; thy years are throughout all generations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cii. 24.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="334" REF="014137_0333_0F97D3F974730080">For this purpo&s;e we pray again&s;t <HI>&s;udden deaths;</HI> le&s;t we &s;hould be hurried into eternity, and before the judg|ment &s;eat, with our &s;ins upon us, and in an unprepar|ed &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT, now, the murderer robs us of all our precious time,&mdash;&s;ends us &s;uddenly and unexpectedly before the tribunal of GOD, without the po&s;&s;ibility of a GOD <HI>have mercy;</HI> and, perhaps, plunges us, impenitent, into an everla&s;ting hell of mi&s;ery and de&s;pair!&mdash;O! <HI>what re&s;titu|tion</HI> can be made in this ca&s;e! What reparation for this injury! If any guilt can look too big for divine mercy, it mu&s;t be &s;uch guilt as this!</P>
<P>WHAT can <HI>our &s;orrow,</HI> what can <HI>our tears, what</HI> can <HI>even our blood</HI> do towards atoning &s;uch aggravated guilt as this? Can we redeem this &s;oul from hell? Can we again give it a new &s;tate of trial and probation; or one hour wherein to work out its own &s;alvation?</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THIS is a crime again&s;t <HI>humanity;</HI> a crime again&s;t all the &s;oft, tender and &s;ympathetic feelings of the heart! It &s;peaks an infatuated under&s;tanding, a hard heart, a &s;eared con&s;cience!&mdash;A man mu&s;t fir&s;t kill him|&s;elf as it were; do violence to all his feelings, as a man; have totally dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his humanity before he could imbrue his hands in the blood of his fellow-crea|ture, his neighbour, his friend, his brother of the hu|man race.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) IT is a crime truly <HI>diabolical.</HI> The <HI>devil</HI> was a murderer from the beginning; and hence he is called <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> the <HI>de&s;troyer. Envy, malice</HI> and <HI>re|venge,</HI> from which murder &s;prings, as from its proper &s;ource, are pa&s;&s;ions <HI>truly diabolical;</HI> and a man mu&s;t in|deed be a <HI>devil incarnate,</HI> before he can coolly premedi|tate murder, and take plea&s;ure, or enjoy gratification, in &s;pilling innocent blood. And this is the infamous glo|ry of tho&s;e, who &s;cruple not to declare, that <HI>revenge is
<PB N="335" REF="014137_0334_0F97D3FA34683E98">&s;weet!</HI> If there be, indeed, a plea&s;ure in this kind of revenge, it is truly the plea&s;ure of a devil, and perhaps the only &s;pecies of plea&s;ure of which a devil is ca|pable!</P>
<P N="6">(6.) GREAT and <HI>horrible</HI> as the crime of murder is <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> yet there are many circum&s;tances which may ex|ceedingly aggravate and increa&s;e its guilt; from the time when, and place where it is committed; from the per&s;ons upon whom, and deliberate manner in which it is perpetrated. Perhaps it was a poor innocent, a help|le&s;s infant! Perhaps it was an aged, indulgent father, or the child of our bowels! Perhaps it was a brother, or a friend who &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother, and whom we ought to have protected at the hazard of life! Perhaps it was done deliberately, in cold blood, after long premeditation, and for &s;ome &s;light provocation, or upon &s;ome mere punctilio of honour! Perhaps it was the father of a family, who&s;e helple&s;s children depended wholly upon his life for their &s;upport! The&s;e, and a num|ber of other circum&s;tances, render this crime exceedingly heinous.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE aggravated guilt of murder farther appears from the light in which both the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, and the con&s;ciences of men, repre&s;ent it. When <HI>Cain</HI> &s;lew his brother <HI>Abel</HI>&mdash;<Q>The LORD &s;aid, what ha&s;t thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me from the ground.

<P>&rindx; The Author begs leave to return thanks to all his Sub&s;cribers, for the genteel encouragement they have given him; but more e&s;pecially, to the inhabitants of St. Croix, of all denominations, who have &s;ub&s;cribed for not le&s;s than 450 books; which is, indeed, but one among many in&s;tances of re&s;pect and civility he has received from them &s;ince his re&s;idence among them. He heartily wi&s;hes the work was more wor|thy of their acceptance, and hopes, that his di&s;tance from the pre&s;s will apologize for any little errors or inaccuracies which may appear in the work.</P>
