<HEAD>TO The Members of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> SEPARATION in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I am obliged to you all by the Laws of <HI>Humanity</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> &s;o I look on my &s;elf as &s;tanding in a <HI>Pa&s;toral Relation</HI> to &s;ome of you; &s;uch of you, I mean, as have &s;eparated from the particular Church of which <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t hath made me Over&s;eer:</HI> For I can|not think your for&s;aking our Commu|nion, without ever giving me an Op|portunity to an&s;wer and remove tho&s;e Doubts and Difficul|ties you laboured under, can di&s;&s;olve the <HI>&s;acred</HI> Relation which before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us. I therefore e&s;teem it my Duty to promote, as far as I am able, the be&s;t Good of
<PB N="6" REF="006158_0005_1027F8959BD86330">you all; and that particularly by endeavouring to reclaim you from the Error of your pre&s;ent dangerous Ways. This Duty would be much more plea&s;ant to me, if I could di&s;|charge it in a Way agreable to you. I take no Plea&s;ure in <HI>noi&s;y Debate,</HI> much le&s;s in <HI>angry Controver&s;y.</HI> And I don't know any Thing but a Sen&s;e of Duty, a De&s;ire to promote the Intere&s;t of Religion, and your Advantage, that would in|duce me to expo&s;e my &s;elf to that <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Reproach</HI> which are too commonly the Con&s;equence of appearing in this Cau&s;e; and which I expected when I engaged in it. Some of you can te&s;tify for me, that I once &s;tood as high in the E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip of your Party as mo&s;t of my Bre|thren in the Mini&s;try in the&s;e Parts; and I would gladly u&s;e all lawful Means for continuing &s;o: But if encouraging you in dangerous Errors, or neglecting to defend important Truths, be the Price of your Friend&s;hip, I mu&s;t &s;ay you hold it too dear; and how greatly &s;oever I value it, I can|not purcha&s;e it at this Rate. I had rather be the Object of your Ill-Will for di&s;charging my Duty to you, than be ap|plauded by you for neglecting it.</P>
<P>But why, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> &s;hould I be looked on as <HI>your E|nemy, becau&s;e I tell you the Truth?</HI> Or what can ju&s;tify tho&s;e &s;evere and unchri&s;tian Re&s;entments that have been expre&s;&s;ed on my publi&s;hing the SERMON I delivered at the Ordination at <HI>Stanford?</HI> Is it not highly rea&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;ary, nay, do not you your &s;elves expect, and &s;ometimes even <HI>demand</HI> it of us, that we &s;hould ju&s;tify the Principles we act upon? And is any Time more proper and &s;ea&s;onable to in|&s;i&s;t upon and defend <HI>Pre&s;byterian Ordination,</HI> than when it is to be practi&s;ed? Would not you &s;ay we were &s;elf-condem|ned, if we did not <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon this Subject on &s;uch Occa&s;ions? Suppo&s;e a Sermon preached at the Ordination of one of your Mini&s;ters, on the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Epi&s;copal Or|dination,</HI> would you not think it very unrea&s;onable in any of us to di&s;turb the A&s;&s;embly by leaving it in Re&s;entment, in the Time of divine Wor&s;hip; and to fill the Country after|wards with Noi&s;e and Clamour again&s;t the Preacher? Would
<PB N="7" REF="006158_0006_1027F89770C7F5F8">you not &s;ay, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, That we might rea&s;onably have expected &s;uch a Sermon on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; and therefore ought either not to have attended at all, or el&s;e to have &s;taid and heard it out? And if &s;uch a Sermon was afterwards publi&s;hed, would you not &s;ay, that it became us rather fairly to an&s;wer the Argument offered in it, than to threaten, in|&s;ult and defame the Author of it? Now this is exactly what I have to &s;ay in my Ca&s;e. I had a ju&s;t <HI>Right</HI> to offer my Sentiments in the Controver&s;y between us and you, I cho&s;e a &s;uitable <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> to do it. And as I am fully per&s;waded, on long and impartial Con&s;ideration, that your &s;eparating from us is wrong in it&s;elf, and prejudicial to your &s;elves, your Po&s;terity, and your Country, in it's Con&s;equences; e&s;pecially as it tends to the De&s;truction of <HI>practical Religion,</HI> and the Introduction of Immorality and Prophanene&s;s, I e&s;teemed my &s;elf under &s;trong Obligations to tell you this in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t publick Manner; and to endeavour to convince you of it, and impre&s;s a Sen&s;e thereof on your Con&s;ciences. And what is there in all this to rai&s;e or ju&s;tify the Re&s;entment that has been di&s;covered in the Ca&s;e? Why mu&s;t Arguments again&s;t the Church of <HI>England,</HI> even tho' they are unan&s;werable, be &s;tiled <HI>Invectives</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s Vindication, Title Page.</NOTE>, and <HI>Rebuke for his In&s;olence,</HI> be propo&s;ed as <HI>the mo&s;t proper An&s;wer to be given</HI> the Author<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 25.</NOTE>? Why mu&s;t he be treated with &s;o much Contempt, as to be &s;tiled, <HI>His humble Saint&s;hip</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 42.</NOTE>? But above all, Why mu&s;t he be <HI>boldly charged with gro&s;s Preva|rication and Fal&s;hood, done with a wicked Intent,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 22.</NOTE>, when all that is pretended in ju&s;tification of this <HI>bold Charge,</HI> amounts to no more than this, That he was led into a Mi&s;take by tran&s;cribing from an Author whom he named, and whom he might take to be worthy of Credit? This, I &s;ay, is all that is <HI>pretended</HI> to &s;upport this <HI>bold Charge,</HI> and 'tis a great deal more than is true; as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter. But in the
<PB N="8" REF="006158_0007_1027F89B9757EFD8">mean Time, is this the Way to convince me, if I were in an Error? Does your <HI>Vindicator</HI> think it the be&s;t Method to recommend him&s;elf or his Cau&s;e to the World? Or will he pretend to reconcile &s;uch Treatment to his own Declaration, That <HI>if any Objections are thought weighty and forceable again&s;t conforming</HI> [to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>] he and you <HI>&s;hould all be plea&s;ed to &s;ee them offered in their full Strength, that</HI> you <HI>may thereby be reclaimed from de&s;tructive Errors, if</HI> you <HI>have embraced them, or have Oppoptunity, by refuting &s;uch in</HI> THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS, <HI>to repre&s;ent Truth in it's native Lu&s;tre</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 6.</NOTE>? Such Reflections as I have mentioned, prove no|thing, unle&s;s it be, that the Author of them is very <HI>angry</HI> and very <HI>impotent;</HI> and &s;o long as there remains any Sen&s;e of good Nature and Politene&s;s, Mankind will be apt to judge, that no Man who was able to defend his Cau&s;e in a fair, can|did and generous Manner, would treat an Antagoni&s;t in &s;uch a Way as this; and therefore conclude, either that your Cau&s;e is bad, or that your Advocate is ill cho&s;en. For my own Part, I can patiently bear &s;uch Abu&s;es, knowing I have not de&s;erved them, and expecting to convince you and the World that they are injurious, when I come to con&s;ider the Paragraphs which contain them. And in the mean Time, in&s;tead of <HI>rendring Evil for Evil, and Railing for Railing,</HI> I chu&s;e to imitate him, <HI>who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he &s;uffered, threatened not; but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly.</HI> I proceed therefore to what more immediately concerns the Controver&s;y between us.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has given us your Opinion in this Contro|ver&s;y, in the&s;e Words, <Q>We a&s;&s;ert the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in all the Territories belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> to be <HI>&s;afe</HI> and <HI>lawful,</HI> in Re&s;pect of the Laws of God and Man: We a&s;&s;ert it to be not only <HI>expedient</HI> but <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> too, in order to di&s;charge the <HI>Duty</HI> we owe to God, and the Peace and Order of So|ciety,
<PB N="9" REF="006158_0008_1027F89D1FC7A690">that every Man that has Opportunity, &s;hould ac|tually embrace this Communion. Men not only con&s;i&s;|tently with their Duty <HI>may,</HI> but to di&s;charge their Duty <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if they are Members of the Nation of <HI>England.</HI></Q> Page 6. This Way of expre&s;&s;ing the Point in di&s;pute is <HI>inaccurate,</HI> and may be apt to lead you into a Mi&s;take; I &s;hall therefore &s;tate the Matter more exactly. And would ob&s;erve, that &s;trictly &s;peaking, there is no &s;uch Thing as the "<HI>the King|dom of</HI> England". The I&s;land of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was for|merly divided into a great Number of petty Sovereignties, the <HI>South</HI> Part of it (commonly called <HI>England</HI>) was in the Days of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors, divided into <HI>&s;even</HI> di&s;tinct Kingdoms, and continued &s;o for &s;everal Ages. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> all the&s;e were united and incorporated in one Monarchy by the Name of the <HI>Kingdom of England,</HI> the <HI>northern</HI> Part of the I&s;land remained for many Ages a di&s;tinct Monarchy, under the Name of <HI>the Kingdom of Scotland.</HI> But about <HI>for|ty</HI> Years ago the&s;e two Kingdoms were united in one entire and grand Monarchy, to be forever after called and known by the Name of the <HI>Kingdom of</HI> GREAT-BRITAIN. So that it is now as really improper to &s;peak of <HI>"the King|dom of England"</HI> as it is to &s;peak of the <HI>Kingdom of Kent;</HI> for as <HI>Kent,</HI> which was an independent Kingdom during the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy,</HI> upon it's being &s;ubdued by EGBERT King of <HI>We&s;&s;ex, Anno</HI> 824, cea&s;ed to be a di&s;tinct Kingdom, and became a Part of that into which it was incorporated; So the <HI>Kingdom of England</HI> being incorporated with the <HI>Kingdom of Scotland,</HI> by the ACT OF UNION, <HI>Anno</HI> 1707, cea&s;ed to be a di&s;tinct Kingdom, and has ever &s;ince been con&s;idered as a Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> On this Occa&s;ion the <HI>Royal Style</HI> was changed from <HI>King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,</HI> into <HI>King of Great Britain, France and Ireland.</HI> And from this Time, when there is Occa&s;ion to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Phra&s;eology in Acts of Parliament, Orders of Council, and the like, is not the <HI>Kingdom of England</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of Scotland,</HI> but
<PB N="10" REF="006158_0009_1027F89FDE8E53A0"><HI>that Part of the Kingdom of Great Britain called England,</HI> &amp;c. Thus it is in the Order for ob&s;erving the <HI>Fifth of November,</HI> which &s;tands in your Common-Prayer Books immediately before the Office for that Day. 'Tis therefore at be&s;t an inaccurate Way of &s;peaking, for Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> to tell us here of "<HI>Territories belonging to the Kingdom of</HI> England", and of being "<HI>Members of the Nation of</HI> England", and to mention <HI>Page</HI> 34, 35. "<HI>The Colonies depending on the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>and to be e&s;teemed as Part of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation.</HI>" For tho' &s;uch a Way of &s;peaking may do well enough in or|dinary Conver&s;ation, yet it mu&s;t not be u&s;ed in &s;trict Di&s;|puting, e&s;pecially when any of the Arguments turn upon this Point, as &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s plainly do.</P>
<P>All within this Kingdom, which thus comprehends both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> who profe&s;s Faith in CHRIST and Subjection to him, however they may differ in Things not e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity, are Members of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Church, or Subjects of JESUS CHRIST within the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> But there are two different eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titutions which have obtained very full and ample legal E|&s;tabli&s;hments in different Parts of this Kingdom. <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> or the <HI>Prelatic</HI> Con&s;titution is by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>South Part</HI> of the Kingdom, and the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Con&s;ti|tution is as fully and legally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>North</HI> Part of it. <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Con&s;titution, or the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> mu&s;t be maintained as an e&s;&s;ential Part of the civil Con&s;titu|tion of the Kingdom. The ACT OF UNION may be con|&s;idered as the CHARTER of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> 'Tis what con&s;titutes one entire Kingdom to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by that Name, as the <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> incorpo|rates the two ancient <HI>Colonies</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> into one entire and new <HI>Province.</HI> Now the <HI>Act of Union</HI> not only <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hes</HI> the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but declares it <HI>unalterable.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>England</HI> continued a di&s;tinct Kingdom, the&s;e <HI>A|merican</HI> Plantation were ju&s;tly con&s;idered as Colonies de|pendant
<PB N="11" REF="006158_0010_1027F8A16D92BF80">on the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> And there are tho&s;e yet living who remember when the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> were by Royal Proclamation forbid trading with the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were then attempting a Settlement on the I&s;tmas of <HI>Darian.</HI> But &s;ince the <HI>Union</HI> the&s;e Colonies are <HI>Briti&s;h Plantations.</HI> They have an equal Relation to every Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and an equal Freedom of Trade in the &s;everal Ports of it; and <HI>Gla&s;cow</HI> Goods are enter'd in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es in the Plantations by the Name of <HI>Briti&s;h Manufactures</HI> as <HI>London</HI> Goods are, and with the &s;ame-Free|dom from Cu&s;toms and Duties.</P>
<P>The true State of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and of the <HI>American</HI> Colonies dependent on it, being thus explained and &s;et in it's ju&s;t Light, I am now ready to con&s;ider the&s;e <HI>Three Que&s;tions,</HI> which comprehend the Controver&s;y between you and us, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Whether the Inhabitants of the&s;e dependent Colonies, tho&s;e of <HI>New-England</HI> in particular, are OBLIGED in Point of DUTY, by the Laws of God or Man, to conform to the <HI>Prelatic</HI> Church e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in the <HI>South Part</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Whether it be EXPEDIENT, or <HI>proper in Point of</HI> PRUDENCE, for tho&s;e who are already &s;ettled in &s;uch Churches as have &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in <HI>New-England,</HI> to for|&s;ake them and embrace <HI>that Communion?</HI> And,</P>
<P N="3">III. Whether it be LAWFUL for particular Members of <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Churches to &s;eparate from them, and join in Communion with the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> A&s;&s;emblies in the Country?</P>
<P>The&s;e three Que&s;tions compri&s;e the Whole of the Con|trover&s;y between Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> and me. They are, tho' under &s;omething different Expre&s;&s;ions, and in the inverted Order, the very Heads under which he ranges and propo&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="006158_0011_1027F8A42A3A5550">to con&s;ider the Objections again&s;t you contained in my <HI>Ser|mon.</HI> See his <HI>Vindication, p.</HI> 6. How well he has &s;ucceeded in an&s;wering my Objections, and ju&s;tifying your Conduct, and his own, in &s;eparating from us, I am heartily willing you your&s;elves &s;hould judge, when you have heard my Re|ply. And I de&s;ire no other Favour of you in the Ca&s;e, but that you will lay a&s;ide Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice, impartially con&s;ider the Merits of the Cau&s;e, judge as tho&s;e that expect finally to be judged; and upon the whole, act as becomes tho&s;e who value the Glory of God, the Honour of the RE|DEEMER, and the Advancement of <HI>practical Religion,</HI> above the Intere&s;t of any Party, or the Gratification of any Re|&s;entment whatever. I &s;hall therefore go on to con&s;ider the&s;e Que&s;tions particularly and di&s;tinctly; and if I di&s;cour&s;e &s;omething largely upon them, it will proceed from my be|ing &s;omething de&s;irous, not only to reply to all Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI> has offered in your Vindication, but to obviate or an|&s;wer &s;uch other Objections as you your&s;elves &s;ometimes make to us. And as the Controver&s;y, at lea&s;t in this Form of it, is &s;omething new, I hope on this Account, the Length of my Book will be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The FIRST QUESTION is, <HI>Whether the Inhabitants of the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Plantations in</HI> America, <HI>tho&s;e of</HI> New-England <HI>in particular, are obliged in</HI> DUTY, <HI>by the Laws of God or Man, to conform to the</HI> Prelatic <HI>Church by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the</HI> South Part <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has plainly enough told us which Side of this Que&s;tion he holds; he a&s;&s;erts, that "<HI>Men not only</HI> MAY <HI>but</HI> MUST <HI>be of the Communion of the Church of</HI> England". <HI>p.</HI> 6. And he <HI>"believes it the</HI> DUTY <HI>of all to become Pro|&s;elites to it." p.</HI> 34. And <HI>"the&s;e</HI> (he &s;ays) <HI>mu&s;t be &s;uppo|&s;ed to be the Sentiments of all tho&s;e, who endeavour to pro&s;elite Men from every Sect to the Communion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church."
<PB N="13" REF="006158_0012_1027F8A953D11308">p.</HI> 6. And he &s;peaks of the &s;ame Per&s;ons and the &s;ame Things, as are mention'd in the Que&s;tion, tho' he don't u&s;e exactly the &s;ame Terms. He calls the&s;e Plantations "<HI>Ter|ritories belonging to the Kingdom of</HI> England." <HI>p.</HI> 6. And <HI>"Colonies depending on the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>and to be e&s;teem|ed Part of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation." p.</HI> 35. I chu&s;e to &s;peak more exactly, and therefore call them <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations. He calls the Communion you have embraced, the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;peaks of it as the <HI>National Church,</HI> and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Communion, and that in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as excludes all other Forms of Church Government and Wor&s;hip from being <HI>national</HI> or <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> For he argues the Nece&s;&s;ity of conforming to this Church, from it's being the <HI>National E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> and infers, <HI>our</HI> Obligations hereto, from <HI>our</HI> being Members of that Nation in which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Which Arguments &s;uppo&s;e, that it is the <HI>only</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Nation.

Now <HI>England,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>Scotland,</HI> is not a Kingdom, or a Nation, in Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s Sen&s;e, for it is not a civil Society, having a Right to make Laws and govern it&s;elf: But is a Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation. And if <HI>England</HI> be not an entire and di&s;tinct Kingdom or
<PB N="14" REF="006158_0013_1027F8ADA355BB08">Nation, it will follow that the Church of <HI>England</HI> cannot be the <HI>National E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as to exclude all other Churches from being &s;o. I acknowledge it to be a <HI>National Church,</HI> that is, a Church e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;upreme Authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, for a certain Part, tho' not for the Whole of that Nation. And this, as I have already &s;hewn, is equally true of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And therefore, that I may repre&s;ent Things as they <HI>truly are,</HI> and not lead you into any Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions concerning them. I choo&s;e, in &s;tating the Que&s;tion, to &s;ay, <HI>The Church by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;outh Part of</HI> Great-Britain. I go on to en|quire what Obligations the Inhabitants of the <HI>Colonies</HI> are under, by Virtue of the Laws of God or Man, to &s;ubmit or conform to this eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;tituton. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis plain that we can't be <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> obliged to this, <HI>merely</HI> from it's being <HI>an E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in that Nation of which we are a Part.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> repeatedly u&s;es this Argument, and in&s;i&s;ts on it as a Proof of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of our conforming to the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Thus he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 6. <Q>Men&mdash;<HI>to di&s;|charge their Duty</HI> MUST be of the Communion of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> if they are <HI>Members of the Nation of England".</HI> And again, <HI>p.</HI> 37. "It may &s;urely be urged upon <HI>every Man that is Engli&s;h,</HI> that belongs to this Nation, and is properly a Part of it, in whatever Corner he may live, that <HI>his</HI> DUTY <HI>obliges him</HI> to be of the Com|munion of the <HI>Church of England.</HI></Q> And he informs us that the&s;e are the <HI>real Sentiments</HI> of all the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;io|naries, p.</HI> 6. I confe&s;s he ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t ac|quainted with the Sentiments of his Brethren, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have tho't, that at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ome of them,</HI> had known bet|ter than to act upon &s;o weak a Principle, or u&s;e &s;o fallacious an Argument as this. An eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment may be made for but a Part of a Nation; and it, at mo&s;t, obli|ges tho&s;e only for whom it is made. A Man may therefore be a Member of a certain Nation, which has an eccle&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="15" REF="006158_0014_1027F8AFDEED8AA0">Con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;overeign Authority, and yet be under no Obligation to conform to that Con&s;titution; for he may not be of that <HI>Part of the Nation</HI> for which it was made, and to which only it is, in any Sen&s;e, obligatory. I can hardly think Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> him&s;elf will a&s;&s;ert, that the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> are obliged to conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on the Account of it's being a national E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, tho' it be undeniably true, that they are Subjects in the &s;ame Kingdom with the People of <HI>England,</HI> and Members of the &s;ame Nation, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the &s;ame civil Society, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an independent Right of Legi&s;lation and Government, which is his own De&s;cription of a Nation, <HI>p.</HI> 36. Much le&s;s will he allow that the Inhabitants of that Part of the Kingdom called <HI>England,</HI> are obliged to conform to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' I have proved <HI>that</HI> to be a national E&s;tabli&s;h|ment equally with the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is truly this, There are <HI>two</HI> different eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hments within the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they are, each of them, <HI>National Churches,</HI> that is, Churches <HI>ap|proved, ratified</HI> and <HI>confirmed</HI> by the &s;upreme Legi&s;lature of our Nation. If therefore the <HI>one</HI> of them may claim our Subjection, <HI>merely</HI> on the Account of it's being <HI>a National E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> the <HI>other</HI> has an <HI>equal Claim</HI> to it. And to be <HI>equally obliged</HI> to conform to both, is, in Reality, to be <HI>not obliged</HI> to conform to either; for contrary Obligations of e|qual Force nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troy each other. This Argument therefore drawn from the Notion of a <HI>national E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> can't po&s;&s;ibly oblige the Inhabitants of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations to conform to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> for it is ju&s;t as &s;trong to oblige their Conformity to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is likewi&s;e a <HI>national E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in that Kingdom of which we are dependent Colonies. Let us try whether Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI>'s Argument will not run as &s;mooth, &s;ound as well, and conclude as &s;trong, changing the Terms according to this State of the Que&s;tion thus, Men mu&s;t be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> if they are Members of the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation,</HI> and it may &s;urely be urged upon every Man
<PB N="16" REF="006158_0015_1027F8B405F25E90">that is <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> that belongs to this Nation, and is properly a Part of it, in whatever Corner he may live, that his Duty obliges him to be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> If Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> allows that the Argument con|cludes in this Form, I demand what it proves, for it hap|pens that there are two different <HI>Briti&s;h National Churches.</HI></P>
<P>If this is not &s;ufficient to cure Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> of his Fond|ne&s;s of this <HI>National Argument,</HI> I would a&s;k him, Whether tho&s;e in the Plantations that came from <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> de|&s;cended from <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Ance&s;tors are in Duty obliged to be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> His Argument if there be any Force in it, would conclude this; for 'tis but changing the Terms, and it runs thus; Men mu&s;t be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if they are Members of the <HI>Scotti&s;h Nation,</HI> &amp;c. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>England</HI> may be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the <HI>Union,</HI> &s;o may <HI>Scotland</HI> too. And if this be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, I hope Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> will be &s;o good as to let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, in his next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Communion tho&s;e are obliged to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, who are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> one of their Parents of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and by the other of <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> De|&s;cent.</P>
<P>By this Time, I believe, you are &s;en&s;ible that there is no Strength at all, in the Argument your Advocate thus u&s;es, to vindicate your Conduct; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> he has nothing better to offer in your Defence, your Cau&s;e mu&s;t be given up. And if there be no arguing our Obligation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from it's being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, he that would convince us that it is our <HI>Duty</HI> to confo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to it, ought to be able to &s;hew that the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h this Church <HI>extend to us,</HI> and plainly require <HI>our</HI> Conformi|ty to it. In Oppo&s;ition to which, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h the epi&s;copal Church in the South Part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> do not oblige the Inha|bitants of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>America</HI> to conform to it. I dont remember that any of your Writers have <HI>attempted</HI> to prove, or &s;o much as <HI>plainly a&s;&s;erted</HI> that the Laws of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="006158_0016_1027F8B58D42FD30">made for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and Support of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Church there, do extend to, or are in Force in the Plantations. I believe they have been better advi&s;ed. Their u&s;ual Prac|tice is to take this for granted, and argue upon it as if it were not di&s;puted. Thus Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;tiles the People of <HI>Strat|ford</HI> that don't come to Church, his <HI>di&s;&s;enting Pari&s;hioners,</HI> which &s;uppo&s;es <HI>his Church</HI> to be <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> THERE, and yet he is &s;o kind as to tell us, and he quoted the <HI>Lords Ju&s;tices of Great-Britain</HI> for it, <HI>"That there is no regular E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of any national or provincial Church in the&s;e Plantation"</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Second Letter to <HI>di&s;&s;. Pari&s;h. p.</HI> 8.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays many Things likewi&s;e, which &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e Laws extend to us. Thus he repre&s;ents his Fellow-Mi&s;&s;ionaries as endeavouring "<HI>to pro&s;elite Men from every Sect to the Communion of the</HI> ESTABLISHED CHURCH". <HI>p.</HI> 6. He mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean the Church e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>tho&s;e Places</HI> in which tho&s;e Gentlemen endeavour to make Pro&s;e|lites; for if he means no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e than that this Church is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in <HI>&s;ome other</HI> Parts of the World, a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary, in any one of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, might u&s;e the <HI>pompous Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> with the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Propriety.</P>
<P>But though your Writers are <HI>cautious</HI> on this Head, yet &s;ome of you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> who perhaps are not &s;o well aware of the Con&s;equences of it, are ready enough in Conver&s;ation, to declare that the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> do extend hither. I have heard &s;ome of you declare, that you were under an higher Obligation to ob&s;erve <HI>Chri&s;t|ma&s;s,</HI> than one of our Days of Thank&s;giving; and give this Rea&s;on for it, That there was an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> for the Ob&s;ervation of the one, and only an <HI>Act of the General A&s;&s;em|bly</HI> of <HI>Connecticut</HI> for ob&s;erving the other. And it is common with you to repre&s;ent your &s;elves as yielding Obedience to the KING and the <HI>Laws of the Nation,</HI> in conforming to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> To convince you of your Mi&s;take in
<PB N="18" REF="006158_0017_1027F8B767842278">this Matter, and &s;hew you how much you are impo&s;ed on by tho&s;e who argue on this Suppo&s;ition, I would enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether ALL THE LAWS of <HI>England</HI> made for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and Support of the Epi&s;copal Church, do ex|tend to the Plantations in <HI>America?</HI> Tho&s;e of you who are in any Mea&s;ure acquainted with the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in this Re&s;pect, will not, I am confident, be fond of an&s;wering this Que&s;tion in the affirmative; for there are &s;ome Laws of this Kind, which, I believe, you would not care to be under. By the Law of <HI>England</HI> the Clergy are entitled to <HI>Tithes,</HI> and their Pari&s;hioners are obliged to pay them. The&s;e are <HI>by Law</HI> due to the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Church.</HI> Now if the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h this Church extend to the Plantations, you are o|bliged to pay your Mini&s;ter, a <HI>tenth Part</HI> of all the Produce of your Lands, and of all the Increa&s;e of your Cattle of every Kind. And if the Laws you live under have made this his Due, you are guilty of <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> in withholding it from him; and Inju&s;tice of the highe&s;t Kind; for it is, upon your own Principle, a <HI>Robbing</HI> GOD. But now &s;ince your Clergy dont claim nor you pay Tithes, I mu&s;t conclude you don't think this Law extends to the Plantations. Well then, let us look upon it as a Point &s;ettled between us, that <HI>all the Laws</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> made for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and Support of the Church do <HI>not</HI> oblige us. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. I demand a Rea&s;on for di&s;tingui&s;hing in the Ca&s;e, or &s;aying, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of tho&s;e Laws <HI>do,</HI> when <HI>others</HI> of them con|fe&s;&s;edly <HI>do not</HI> extend to us. If the Laws of <HI>England, as &s;uch,</HI> extend to the Plantations, <HI>all</HI> of them mu&s;t be allowed to do &s;o. And if they do not as <HI>&s;uch,</HI> or meerly by Virtue of their being the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> oblige us; it will concern him, who pretends that any particular Law of <HI>England</HI> is obliga|tory <HI>here,</HI> to give &s;ome Rea&s;on for this, by &s;hewing &s;ome|thing that di&s;tingui&s;hes that particular Law from the others. Thus, for In&s;tance, If any Man tells me, that the <HI>Act of U|niformity</HI> extends to the&s;e Plantations, tho' the Law for <HI>pay|ing
<PB N="19" REF="006158_0018_1027F8B903D74AA8">Tythes</HI> does not; I demand a Rea&s;on for this Difference between the&s;e two Laws, and if none can be given, &s;hall conclude, that I am as free from any Obligation to the one as the other of them.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes been &s;aid that the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>Eng|land</HI> extends to the Plantations, but the <HI>Statutes</HI> do not, un|le&s;s the Plantations are named <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them. But this Di&s;tinction, if it were to be allowed, wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I apprehend) rather hurt than help your Cau&s;e, in the In&s;tance ju&s;t now mentioned; for the Law for <HI>Uniformity</HI> in meerly <HI>a Statute,</HI> whereas, I &s;uppo&s;e, Tithes are due to the Clergy by <HI>Common Law,</HI> tho' many Statutes may have been made, for the more ea&s;y Re|covery of them. I may perhaps be mi&s;taken in this Point, for I don't pretend to any great Skill in the Law. And if the Obligation to pay Tithes ari&s;es <HI>originally</HI> from <HI>Statute</HI> Law, tho&s;e <HI>two Laws</HI> are in this Re&s;pect <HI>equal,</HI> and neither of them obliges us in this Country, unle&s;s the <HI>Acts them&s;elves</HI> expre&s;ly mention and are extended to the Plantations in <HI>A|merica.</HI> Whether there be any Statute requiring the Pay|ment of Tythes to the Clergy, which mentions the&s;e Plan|tations, I am not <HI>Lawyer</HI> enough to determine: But I am &s;ure the Acts of Uuniformity do not. There are <HI>two</HI> Acts of this Kind now in Force in <HI>England,</HI> except &s;uch Clau&s;es in them as are contrary to the <HI>Act of</HI> TOLERATION. The&s;e are u&s;ually printed with the Common-Prayer Book: The former of them was enacted in the fir&s;t Year of Queen ELIZABETH, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1559, the latter in the four|teenth Year of King CHARLES II. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1662. There is nothing in either of the&s;e Statutes, that &s;o much as looks like a De&s;ign of extending the E&s;tabli&s;hment to the&s;e <HI>Ameri|can</HI> Plantations, except tho&s;e Words in the former of them, <HI>"Or other the Queen's Dominions."</HI> And the&s;e are far from being &s;ufficient to to extend it hither.

<P N="1">(1.) This Statute, when it was in it's fulle&s;t and mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive Force, was never de&s;ign'd or under&s;tood to extend hither. This general Expre&s;&s;ion did not, either in it's own Nature, or in the Intention of the Legi&s;lators, extend to the

The <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Ordinal</HI> which were e&s;tabli&s;hed by Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>'s Statutes, were revived, and had Additions and Altera|tions made in them by the fir&s;t Convocation that &s;at in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II, and the&s;e were &s;uch as rendred them, in the Sen&s;e of the Law, <HI>other Books;</HI> &s;o different from the for|mer, that there was need of a <HI>new</HI> Statute to e&s;tabli&s;h and enforce the U&s;e of them. Upon which the la&s;t Act of Uni|formity was made, which provides, That the Book of Com|mon-Prayer, and the Book of Ordination, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, &s;hall be u&s;ed and ob&s;erved until the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> 1662; and enacts, That a Book of Common-Prayer and Ordination, agreed upon by the Convocation then &s;itting, and annexed to this Act, &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed and u&s;ed from that Time forward. 'Tis evi|dent therefore, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Ordinal</HI> are repealed; and that no Man has been obliged to u&s;e them &s;ince St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Day, 1662. Now the Repeal of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> was really and properly a Repeal of her <HI>Uniformity-Act,</HI> which had no other View or De&s;ign but to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>that</HI> Liturgy, nor a &s;ingle Clau&s;e that related to any thing el&s;e. So that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Act of Uniformity would have been ab&s;olutely repealed, to all In|tents and Purpo&s;es, by King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Act of Uniformity,

All the Force therefore which the fir&s;t Act of Uniformity <HI>now</HI> has, is entirely owing to the &s;aving Clau&s;e in the latter Act; and con&s;equently Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Act, tho' it has tho&s;e Words in it (<HI>other the Queen's Dominions</HI>) can't be more exten&s;ive than King <HI>Charles</HI>'s, to which it owes all the Life it has. Now nothing can be more certain than that King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Statute is limited to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> the Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed;</HI> which are likewi&s;e the very Limitations u&s;ed in the Statute (7th of <HI>William</HI> III.

Having thus (I hope &s;ufficiently) prov'd that the Laws of Man do not oblige us to conform to the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> it remains to enquire, Whether the Laws of God do &s;o? I go on therefore to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. There is no <HI>Divine Law</HI> that requires our Conformi|ty to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays on this Head, <Q>If it be every Man's indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to be a Chri&s;tian, the &s;ame Duty will oblige him to be and con|tinue a Member of the Church of Chri&s;t, which is his Body, to pre&s;erve and maintain the Peace, Order and Unity of the Body, and e&s;pecially of that Part to which he particularly belongs; which will infer the Duty of reve|rencing and &s;ubmitting to the Officers regularly pre&s;iding and governing in &s;uch Church; which being the Bi&s;hops of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in chief; every one that makes a Part of this Nation owe Reverence and Submi&s;&s;ion to them, under Chri&s;t, and may e&s;teem our Saviour's Words to his Apo&s;tles, applicable to &s;uch Prelates; <HI>He that de|&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me.</HI></Q> <HI>p.</HI> 37, 38. I can ea&s;ily allow that the &s;ame Duty which obliges a Man to be a Chri&s;tian, obliges him to be a Member of the Church of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and a <HI>Member of the Church of Chri&s;t,</HI> are preci&s;ely the &s;ame Thing. But that a Man is under as &s;trong Obliga|tion to be a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or of any other particular Church whatever, as to be a Chri&s;tian, is what mu&s;t not be allowed. To be a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Salvation, at lea&s;t to all who have Op|portunity and Ability to judge of the Evidences of the Go&s;|pel; for of all &s;uch 'tis undoubtedly true, That <HI>He that be|lieveth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> But this cannot be &s;aid of every one that is not a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or any one particular Church in the World. 'Tis very po&s;&s;ible that any Church may wrongfully exclude a Per&s;on from her Com|munion, or excommunicate him, <HI>Clave errante.</HI> The Church or <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' &s;he claims <HI>Infallibility</HI> in her <HI>doctrinal Deci&s;ions,</HI> yet acknowledges &s;he may be mi&s;taken in judging Matters
<PB N="25" REF="006158_0024_1027F8CE4D47E318">of <HI>Fact,</HI> becau&s;e in the&s;e the Church depends on human Te&s;timony, which may be fal&s;e, and &s;he has no Way to di&s;cover the Fal&s;ity. And &s;ure no Man, in his Sen&s;es, will &s;ay, that an unju&s;t Excommunication cuts a Per&s;on off from Chri&s;t, and nece&s;&s;arily infers eternal Condemnation.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange Tho't of Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s, that the Law of God requires us to &s;ubmit to the Bi&s;hops of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e we make a Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, as he <HI>will</HI> call it. By this Rule an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> mu&s;t be an <HI>E|pi&s;copalian,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> a <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> a <HI>Cal|vini&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Sweede,</HI> a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and all this by Virtue of the Law of God. Whereas the divine Law, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, does not at all con&s;ider the&s;e petty Di&s;tinctions between Nations, for in Chri&s;t there is neither <HI>Jew</HI> nor <HI>Greek, Barbarian</HI> nor <HI>Scythian.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI> quotes that Text, Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have have the Rule over you, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves; for they watch for your Souls, as they that mu&s;t give Account;</HI> and ob&s;erves upon it. <Q>The <HI>Greek</HI> Word here rendred, <HI>them that have the Rule over you,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Governors,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Prelates</HI> are in the Church.</Q> If Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> means that the Word <HI>always</HI> means Governors, he is mi&s;taken, as he mu&s;t own, if he will but turn to Acts 14.12. <Q>And they called <HI>Barnabas, Ju|piter;</HI> and <HI>Paul, Mercurius;</HI> becau&s;e he was the <HI>chief Speaker</HI>:</Q> In the Original, <HI>Egoumenos Logou.</HI> Here the Word <HI>Egoumenos,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays, &s;ignifies <HI>Gover|nor,</HI> is u&s;ed of the Per&s;on who was thought to be <HI>inferior;</HI> for <HI>Mercury</HI> is in the <HI>Grecian Mythology</HI> much beneath <HI>Jupi|ter.</HI> Or if Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> thinks that whenever it is u&s;ed for a Ruler or Governor, it means an <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> one, he is again mi&s;taken; for the &s;ame Word is u&s;ed of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Acts</HI> 7.10. And yet <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was no Bi&s;hop. But if we al|low all he &s;ays upon this Text, it will not &s;erve his Turn; for if the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> may claim my Obedience, by Vir|tue of this Text, &s;o may the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> The di|vine Law has no where determined which of the&s;e is our <HI>Di|oce&s;an;</HI> and therefore, if this is ever done, it mu&s;t be by hu|man
<PB N="26" REF="006158_0025_1027F8CFEADFF3C0">Laws: and the Laws of the Nation not having e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the prelatic Church in the Plantations, do not oblige me to &s;ubmit to either of them.</P>
<P>It follows <HI>p.</HI> 38. <Q><HI>There are many Texts in the New-Te&s;ta|ment, forbidding Divi&s;ions, requiring the Pre&s;ervation of U|nity, Peace, and Order.</HI></Q> I heartily wi&s;h he and you had &s;hewn more Regard to them, and not broken the Unity, and di&s;turbed the Peace and Order of our Churches, by your <HI>un|nec&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>&s;inful Separation</HI> from them. And when he adds, Texts requiring, <HI>"Submi&s;&s;ion to Government,"</HI> this will not at all excu&s;e you; for neither God nor Man required this of you. One of tho&s;e Texts requiring Submi&s;&s;ion to Go|vernment, which I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> had his Eye upon, which is commonly, tho' very improperly u&s;ed in this Con|trover&s;y, and which (I know) many of you depend much upon, tho' it really makes nothing for your Cau&s;e, is, 1 Pet. 2.13. <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI> This Epi&s;tle was probably written about the &s;ixth Year of NERO the Roman Emperor. The Laws of the Empire at this Time in Force, e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Pagani&s;m</HI> as the national Religion, and it was but four Years after that this Emperor order'd the Chri&s;tians to be per&s;ecuted, for not conforming to the National Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of the Empire. And in this Per&s;ecution, according to the be&s;t Accounts we have, St. <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf &s;uffered <HI>Martyr|dom.</HI> Now I appeal to your own Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> Whether in the&s;e Circum&s;tances, the Apo&s;tle, by <HI>every Ordinance of Man,</HI> ought not to be under&s;tood, as meaning only &s;uch Laws as were of a mere <HI>civil</HI> Nature. Can you po&s;&s;ibly believe, that he directed Chri&s;tians to &s;ubmit to the imperial Laws of a <HI>religious</HI> Nature, which were all <HI>Heatheni&s;h,</HI> and which he him&s;elf cho&s;e rather to die than conform to? And I &s;ubmit to the Learned, whether <HI>Kti&s;is anthropine,</HI> the Expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in the Original, don't rather &s;ignify a Law relating to human <HI>Affairs,</HI> than one re&s;pecting <HI>divine Wor&s;hip.</HI> Where any Man therefore u&s;es this and &s;uch like Texts to enforce Conformity to the Church of

<P>If Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> therefore would have us believe the Law of God requires our Conformity to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he mu&s;t produce &s;ome other Texts of Scripture; very different from tho&s;e he has hitherto referred us to. But if this is not to be <HI>directly</HI> proved from any expre&s;s Text in the <HI>Bible,</HI> perhaps it may be <HI>con&s;equentially</HI> inferred by Arguments well formed on Scripture. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has attempted &s;ome|thing of this Nature, in what he &s;ays concerning the <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> he charges on our Forefathers. I therefore proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Inhabitants of <HI>New-England</HI> are not obliged to conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on Account of any <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> made by their Forefathers in leaving that Communion. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> u&s;es this as one of his be&s;t Arguments, and writes with an <HI>Air of Triumph</HI> whenever he is upon this Subject. Thus, <HI>p.</HI> 29. He repre&s;ents our <HI>"Congregations"</HI> (for he will not call them Churches) as <Q>founded in Schi&s;m, and unju&s;tifiable Separation from the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> or &s;uch as u&s;e their pre&s;ent Con&s;titu|tion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;teemed Abettors and Approvers of Schi&s;m, Di&s;orders, U&s;urpation, Contempt of the chief Au|thority Chri&s;t has left in his Church, and &s;uch like Crimes.</Q> And he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 40. <Q>The awful Guilt of Schi&s;m &mdash; was contracted by tho&s;e who began the Separation in <HI>England,</HI> renounced the Authority of their Governors, and invited di&s;contented People to join their Di&s;obedience; to de|&s;pi&s;e their lawful and faithful Guides, and &s;et up Parties again&s;t them, in Defiance of the Laws of Church and State, and after the Guilt contracted by &s;uch Di&s;obedience and &s;chi&s;matical Separations, what Influence could cro&s;&s;ing the Waters have to purge &s;uch Crimes? or ju&s;tify the &s;ame di&s;obedient Tempers, and unlawful Practices, in a new

The fir&s;t Min&s;ters of <HI>New-England</HI> have a &s;till <HI>blacker</HI> Character given of them, they are &s;tiled PERFIDIOUS <HI>Pre&s;byters of the Church, p.</HI> 22. and RENEGADO <HI>Pre&s;byters, who threw off their Subjection to their Bi&s;hops, and invaded the &s;acred Office, contrary to their Ordination Vow and Promi&s;e, p.</HI> 19. This is the <HI>odious</HI> Character he gives of the fir&s;t Settlers of this Country, and we know who they are in particular to whom he &s;uppo&s;es this Character belongs; for in the <HI>Po&s;t|&s;cript</HI> Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> tells us who he means by "<HI>the Forefathers and Founders of</HI> New-England", even tho&s;e that came from <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1630. He names <HI>John Winthorp</HI> Governor, <HI>Richard Salton&s;tal, I&s;aac John&s;on, Thomas Dudley</HI> and <HI>William Coddington.</HI> He means the Governor and Company of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony, of which the&s;e Gentlemen really were the Leaders. The&s;e were truly, as he &s;tiles them, <HI>our Fore|fathers,</HI> and <HI>the Founders of New-England,</HI> and by &s;ome of them the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> was &s;ettled.</P>
<P>It is &s;urprizing to me, that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;hould thus load with <HI>Infamy</HI> the Memory of tho&s;e from whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, he him&s;elf is de&s;cended, tho&s;e whom he &s;tiles <HI>"our Forefathers."</HI> If <HI>Truth</HI> had been on his Side, <HI>filial Piety</HI> &s;hould have check'd his Pen. Had <HI>his Forefathers</HI> de&s;erved this Character, yet it was not <HI>decent</HI> for <HI>him</HI> to give it. Why mu&s;t he u&s;e &s;o <HI>foul-mouth'd</HI> a Term as that of <HI>Renegado?</HI> A Term of Infamy pe|culiar to tho&s;e mo&s;t <HI>abandon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Wretches,</HI> who renounce the Chri&s;tian Religion and turn <HI>Mahomitans;</HI> and of whom it is commonly remarked, that they di&s;cover va&s;tly greater <HI>Rancour</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> again&s;t Chri&s;tianity than the native <HI>Turks</HI> do. Would Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> think him&s;elf hand&s;omely treated, if I
<PB N="29" REF="006158_0028_1027F8D9A98983B0">&s;hould &s;tile him a <HI>Renegado Pre&s;byter,</HI> on the Account of his renouncing his Pre&s;byterian Ordination, and taking epi&s;co|pal Orders? And yet I could give In&s;tances of his di&s;cover|ing a Temper very much like that of the <HI>Renegado</HI>'s in his Conduct toward tho&s;e who&s;e Communion he has for&s;aken. I dare even leave it to his own Con&s;cience, whether he did not appear very much in the <HI>Renegado Character,</HI> when he declared before many Witne&s;&s;es (&s;ome of which will appear when he calls for them) that he had rather join in Wor&s;hip with a <HI>Jewi&s;h Synagogue</HI> than with a <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church.</HI></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is capable of taking <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in treating the Founders of <HI>New-England</HI> in this Manner, yet I hope you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> can't join with him in it. Can you take Plea&s;ure in reading &s;uch Reflections on tho&s;e from whom you derive your Being, and the Fruit of who&s;e Labours and Sufferings you now enjoy, in the Plenty and Liberty with which this Country is ble&s;s'd? Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> wou'd repre|&s;ent me (in his <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI>) as one of the <HI>"degenerate Chil|dren of our good Forefathers";</HI> and yet I have that Regard for their Memories, that his Treatment of them rai&s;es my Re&s;entment, more than all the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Abu&s;es he has of|fered me.</P>
<P>But is this <HI>infamous Character</HI> he gives of the Fathers of this Country, <HI>true,</HI> or &s;upported by proper Evidence, or does he him&s;elf believe it? Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> (if my Memory don't deceive me) in a Piece publi&s;hed &s;ome Years ago, mentions the <HI>hone&s;t old Puritans</HI> as Enemies to the <HI>Separati&s;ts.</HI> And I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he believes the Founders of <HI>New-England</HI> were generally &s;incere good Men, and are now with God. And for my own Part, I make no Doubt that <HI>when Chri&s;t &s;hall appear, they al&s;o &s;hall appear with him in Glory,</HI> and that their Crowns of Glory will be the more bright and &s;hining, on the Account of their Sufferings for Chri&s;t in their Lives, and the <HI>Reproach</HI> with which Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has loaded their Memories, &s;o long after their Death.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="006158_0030_1027F8DE2B67FFE0">I was therefore ready to &s;urmi&s;e, that &s;ome Per&s;on who met with the Manu&s;cript, after it went from the Author, might have tacked the <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI> to it.

I have &s;ince been credibly inform'd that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has di&s;own'd the <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript;</HI> and therefore &s;hould have been doubtful of quoting it as his, had he not been &s;o kind as to &s;end me one of his Books corrected with his own Pen: But as this has the <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI> annexed to it, I have &s;ufficient Authority for con|&s;idering and treating it as <HI>his.</HI> But to return.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion we are now upon, is, Whether our Fore|fathers contracted "the awful Guilt of Schi&s;m" by leaving the Church of <HI>England?</HI> And con&s;equently, Whether the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> are, in their pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, Schi&s;matical? This is plainly Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s Opinion, or at lea&s;t he would have you think &s;o. And if it be really the Ca&s;e, I readily allow, that you are ju&s;tifiable in for&s;aking our Communion, and returning to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But what Evidence does he produce to &s;upport this Charge? 'Tis a Rule founded in Rea&s;on, That the Evidence ought to be proportion'd to the Nature of the Crime charged: It will therefore require plain and full Evidence to convict us of &s;o <HI>heinous</HI> a Crime as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> allows Schi&s;m to be.

But this, he was &s;en&s;ible, would have proved "a very hard Ta&s;k", and therefore evaded it. However, I will venture to tell him, in his own Words, "He mu&s;t go thro' it before his Charge will lie again&s;t" us. And 'till he does this, he

<P>The next Pa&s;&s;age in which this Matter is mentioned, is in <HI>p.</HI> 40. <Q><HI>The awful Guilt of Schi&s;m&mdash;was contracted by tho&s;e who began the Separation in</HI> England <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Here, if I un|der&s;tand him, he would repre&s;ent the Matter, that the Foun|ders of our Churches &s;et up <HI>&s;chi&s;matical Separations in England,</HI> and afterward cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Atlantic</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h and perpetuate their Schi&s;m. This I utterly deny, and he has not offered the lea&s;t Shadow of Proof of it, unle&s;s his Word mu&s;t be ta|ken for Proof; which he mu&s;t not expect, &s;ince he has not only contradicted it, but even given us &s;ome Evidence that the Fact was really otherwi&s;e. In his <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> he repre|&s;ents the&s;e Per&s;ons as dutiful Sons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and as a Proof of it, gives us an Extract of a <HI>Letter to the Bi&s;hops and Clergy and People of the Church of</HI> England, writ|ten, or at lea&s;t &s;igned, on board the Ship <HI>Arrabella,,</HI> which brought them to <HI>New-England.</HI> This <HI>Letter,</HI> the whole of which, Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays, de&s;erves to be written in Letters of Gold, was, as Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> informs us, "&s;aid to be drawn up by that learned, holy, reverend and famous Mr. <HI>White</HI> of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New-England <HI>Chron.</HI> p. <HI>205.</HI></NOTE>" one of Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s <HI>perfidious renegado Pre&s;|byters,</HI> and &s;igned by another of them, the Rev.

<P>It is well known to all who are acquainted with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> that the <HI>old Puritans,</HI> tho' they greatly di&s;liked many Things in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and endeavoured, by all lawful Means, to procure a further and more perfect Reformation (which Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> elegant|ly calls <HI>"opening their refining Shops in the Kingdom"</HI>) were yet Enemies to Separation. They had a great Dread of contracting the awful Guilt of Schi&s;m. No Men in the Na|tion preach'd or wrote more warmly again&s;t the <HI>Separati&s;ts</HI> than the <HI>Puritans</HI> did. Of this I could produce a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, were it needful.

But from the Beginning it was not &s;o.</Q> And after mentioning St. <HI>Paul, Ignatius, &amp;c.</HI> as te&s;tifying a|gain&s;t Separations, he adds, <Q>So did the old <HI>Puritans,</HI>&mdash;and indeed no body did it more, if &s;o much as they<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>White</HI>'s Defence of his three Letters, <HI>p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>.</Q> This Witne&s;s is true,</P>
<P>There were two Sorts of Men who con&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;crupled, and therefore refu&s;ed to approve of, or u&s;e &s;ome of the Ceremo|nies of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e were all, on this Account, &s;ometimes call'd by the general Name of NONCONFORMISTS: But they did not all go the &s;ame Lengths. Some of them openly and wholly &s;eparated from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; and
<PB N="34" REF="006158_0033_1027F8E6B7985878">were from thence called SEPARATISTS. The re&s;t continu|ed in the Church, and u&s;ed as much of the public Liturgy as they could with a good Con&s;cience, omitting &s;uch Parts as they dare not u&s;e. The&s;e were then called PURITANS, for their profe&s;&s;ing a De&s;ire of a greater <HI>Purity</HI> in the Wor|&s;hip and Ordinances of God. This Sort of Men were &s;ome|times for a while connived at, and at other Times &s;everely puni&s;hed, according as the governing Bi&s;hops happened to be mild or &s;evere in their Temper or Principles.

And the&s;e Things grew &s;o fa&s;t upon them, that in a few Years they tran&s;ported them&s;elves and Families into this Country<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>New-Eng.</HI> Chron. <HI>p.</HI> 238, 239.</NOTE> Thus we have brought our Forefathers &s;afe to <HI>New-England,</HI> and that, free from the Guilt of Schi&s;m; for as yet they had not &s;eparated from, but were Mini&s;ters and Members of, the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I conclude the Account of the Conduct of the&s;e Men, antecedent to their forming them&s;elves into a Church State in this Land, by wi&s;hing (in my turn) that Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI> and his Brethren the epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, with all others who have run into either the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> or the <HI>New Light</HI> Se|paration in this Country, had di&s;covered the &s;ame <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Tem|per,</HI> and acted upon the &s;ame <HI>peaceable Principles</HI> as the&s;e their excellent Forefathers did. This would have prevented the ra&s;h, uncharitable and &s;chi&s;matical Separations they have run
<PB N="35" REF="006158_0034_1027F8E9DC844718">into, to the Di&s;honour and Danger of Religion. For then, if they had tho't any thing greatly ami&s;s in our Con&s;titution, they would have endeavoured to have had it amended, before they had renounced Communion with us. And if the&s;e En|deavours had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and they had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to erect Churches of another Form, they would at lea&s;t have retired into &s;ome other Part of the World, where they might have enjoyed what they &s;o highly valued, without di&s;turbing others, &s;etting up Altar again&s;t Altar, and con|tracting, what Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> agrees with me in &s;tiling, the awful Guilt of Schi&s;m.</P>
<P>Some of you, <HI>my Brethen,</HI> may perhaps think, that though our Forefathers brought no Guilt of Schi&s;m into the Country with them, they might contract &s;ome after their Arrival, by erecting Churches upon a Model &s;o different from that of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> To this I reply, That a <HI>national Church</HI> is in the Nature of it a <HI>local</HI> Thing. It nece&s;&s;arily has it's Bounds and Limits, beyond which it does not extend; and the&s;e are determined by the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h it, or make it a <HI>national</HI> Church. Now I have already proved that the Laws which e&s;tabli&s;h the Church of <HI>England</HI> do not extend to the <HI>American</HI> Plantations. Our Forefathers, therefore, when they arrived in this Country, were entirely without the Pale of the national Church of <HI>England,</HI> and ab&s;olutely at Liberty to form them&s;elves into &s;uch Churches, as they, ac|cording to the be&s;t Light they could obtain, judged mo&s;t a|greable to the <HI>Go&s;pel Model.</HI> Their doing &s;o did, in no De|gree, infringe the Rights or di&s;turb the Peace of any Church under Heaven: And therefore no other Church had any Right to controul them, or Rea&s;on to complain of them. So far as they were per&s;waded in their Con&s;ciences, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was, in it's Con&s;titution and Practices, agreable to the Go&s;pel, they were to imitate it. And this is ju&s;t as true of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or any other Church on Earth. But con&s;ider it merely as a <HI>national</HI> Church, or <HI>legal</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment, they were under no &s;ort of Obligation to it. <HI>Human</HI> Laws did not oblige them in the Ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="006158_0035_1027F8EF206941A8">they did not extend to this Country: And the <HI>Divine</HI> Law did not oblige them in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e (be&s;ides what has been &s;aid before) the Go&s;pel knows no &s;uch Thing as a <HI>National Church.</HI> There is therefore no more Schi&s;m in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> on the Account of their being formed upon a Plan different from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than there is in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church on Account of it's not conforming it&s;elf to the Church of <HI>Geneva,</HI> or to the Prote&s;|tant Churches of <HI>Germany,</HI> which were reformed before it. In one Thing we certainly have the Advantage of you, for the Reformers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' they looked on the Scripture as the proper Rule of Faith, did not think them the <HI>only</HI> Rule in Matters of Government and Wor&s;hip. They never &s;o much as <HI>pretended</HI> to conform the <HI>Polity</HI> and <HI>Ceremo|nies</HI> of the Church to the Scripture Standard; But admitted and retained Things, which they <HI>knew</HI> and <HI>owned</HI> were ne|ver heard of, 'till &s;ome con&s;iderable Time after the Canon of Scripture was fini&s;hed. Whereas the Founders of our Churches always profe&s;&s;ed to make the &s;acred Scriptures the <HI>only</HI> Rule in Matters of Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip, as well as in Articles of Faith. And tho' you may think they mi&s;took the Sen&s;e of Scripture, in &s;ome In&s;tances, and we don't pre|tend they were infallible; yet I believe you think they acted hone&s;tly. Now, if while they &s;incerely endeavoured to con|form the Church State, in every Part of it, to the Rules of God's Word, they were in &s;ome Things mi&s;taken, yet on the Whole, in&s;tead of contracting the formal Guilt of Schi&s;m, they were no doubt approved and accepted of that God, who judges Men by the Sincerity of their Hearts, and not by the Perfection of their Knowledge.</P>
<P>Thus, I hope tho&s;e worthy and excellent Men, the Fa|thers of this Country, are fully cleared from the Crimes, Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has accu&s;ed them of. I have been the larger in vindicating their Reputation, becau&s;e I hope a Veneration for them may be a Means of inducing the pre&s;ent Generation, not only to e&s;teem and hold fa&s;t tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical Privileges they purcha&s;ed for us at &s;o dear a Rate; but al&s;o of exciting
<PB N="37" REF="006158_0036_1027F8F0AA30F2F8">their Po&s;terity to imitate that <HI>&s;erious Religion</HI> and <HI>practical Godline&s;s,</HI> for which they were &s;o remarkable.</P>
<P>And if any of you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> have for&s;aken the Com|munion of the Churches in which you were educated, on the Suppo&s;ition that you ought to do &s;o, becau&s;e your Fathers were guilty of Schi&s;m in erecting them, you were really mi&s;taken, and ought, on your Conviction of this, to return to us.</P>
<P>But if Mr. <HI>Wetmors</HI> can't prove the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> guilty of <HI>formal Schi&s;m,</HI> perhaps he thinks he can prove them <HI>Favourers of Schi&s;m.</HI> He &s;eems to imagine this will infer, the Nece&s;&s;ity of for&s;aking them; and if he can but de&s;troy them, he is not very much concerned about the Means of doing it. Hear how admirably he talks upon this Head, <HI>p.</HI> 29, 30. <Q><HI>If the Congregations, for&s;aking which is called Schi&s;m, are them&s;elves founded in Schi&s;m,&mdash;or in their pre&s;ent Con&s;titution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;teemed Abbettors and Approvers of Schi&s;m, Di&s;orders, U&s;urpation, Contempt of the chief Authority Chri&s;t has left in his Church, or any &s;uch like Crimes: Then &s;uch Congregations &mdash;ought to be e&s;teemed, in Re&s;pect of the my&s;tical Body of Chri&s;t, only as</HI> Excre&s;cencies <HI>or</HI> Tumors <HI>in the Body natural, or perhaps as</HI> Fungo&s;ities <HI>in</HI> an ulcerated Tumor, <HI>the eating away of which, by</HI> what|ever Means, <HI>tends not to the Hurt, but to the Soundne&s;s and Health of the Body.</HI></Q> I can't forbear remarking here, that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> carries the Matter farther than I expected, even from him. I took him indeed for one of tho&s;e <HI>Sur|geons</HI> that would pre&s;cribe <HI>Corro&s;ives,</HI> as the only Means of healing the Wounds of the Church; but I &s;uppo&s;ed he would have been contented with &s;uch Penal Laws as our Fathers &s;uffered under, in the Days of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud.</HI> But to propo&s;e the eating away &s;uch <HI>Fungo&s;ities</HI> as he e&s;teems us, by WHATEVER MEANS, as making for the Health of the Body, is going a great Way indeed. Does he mean to ju&s;|tify &s;uch <HI>Military Executions</HI> as were u&s;ed again&s;t the Pre&s;by|terians in <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Reign of King CHARLES II. or the <HI>Dragooning</HI> the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> in the Time of

The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;&s;enters have always had &s;uch among them&s;elves as have &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified their Conduct to the World.

<P N="1">I. Tho&s;e who have conformed to the Church of <HI>England</HI> in this Country, are not to expect that either GOD or the KING will con&s;ider their Conformity as an <HI>Act of Obedience,</HI> or e&s;teem them as the <HI>better Subjects</HI> on the Account of it.

<P>Our gracious SOVEREIGN, as he makes the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Government, &s;o he always recommends it to his Subjects to make them Standard of their Obedi|ence; and neither de&s;ires nor expects any more from them than the Laws require. You deceive your &s;elves therefore, if you expect your Conformity to Epi&s;copacy &s;hould be ac|cepted as an Act of Obdedience, either of GOD or the KING. You may plea&s;e your &s;elves with the Tho't that you are, on this Account, <HI>better Subjects</HI> or <HI>better Chri&s;tians:</HI> But 'tis all Delu&s;ion and a meer Dream; you proper Judges in both the&s;e Characters, will reject it as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="2">II. It hence follows; that the Communion of our Churches is <HI>mo&s;t &s;afe.</HI> There has been a long Di&s;pute between the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> The Di&s;&s;enters have great and (I think) <HI>unan&s;werable</HI> Objections again&s;t the Go|vernment and Wor&s;hip of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church. The <HI>be&s;t Advocates</HI> the Church has ever had, don't pretend to ju&s;tify many of the Things objected again&s;t, as being <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> or indeed <HI>good in them&s;elves;</HI> but only as Things that may be &s;ubmitted to, and u&s;ed, without Sin, when e&s;tabli&s;hed by lawful Authority. And &s;ome of them plainly own, that they wi&s;h they were changed or quite taken away. Now there is not a &s;ingle Objection made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;&s;enters a|gain&s;t the Con&s;titution or Ceremonies of the <HI>Church,</HI> but what has the &s;ame <HI>full Force</HI> and <HI>undimini&s;hed Weight</HI> in this Country as in <HI>England.</HI> If therefore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;&s;enters are in the <HI>Right,</HI> we are certainly ju&s;tified in not conforming to the <HI>Church.</HI> But if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters in the <HI>Wrong,</HI> if we &s;hould think they ought, from a Regard to the Laws of their Country, to &s;ubmit to the&s;e Things; yet

<P>In a Word, All Arguments again&s;t the Church of <HI>England</HI> conclude <HI>fully</HI> in our Favour, and the better Half of the Arguments that have ever been offered in favour of that <HI>Church,</HI> don't <HI>in the lea&s;t</HI> operate again&s;t us.

In this View of Things, I have often wondred at your <HI>Clergy</HI>'s recommending <HI>&s;uch Books of Controver&s;y</HI> to you, as they often do.

I am &s;ure their Principles directly lead to this. But I proceed to</P>
<P>The SECOND QUESTION.</P>
<P><HI>Whether it be</HI> EXPEDIENT, <HI>or proper in Point of</HI> PRU|DENCE, <HI>for tho&s;e who are already &s;ettled in &s;uch Churches as have &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in</HI> New-England, <HI>to for&s;ake them and embrace that Communion?</HI></P>
<P>Though I hope you are convinced, by what has been al|ready &s;aid, that you were not &s;trictly obliged in Duty, either to God or Man, to for&s;ake our Communion, and embrace the Epi&s;copal; yet, it may be, &s;ome of you may &s;till think, you have acted a rea&s;onable Part, &s;uch an one as became rea|&s;onable Creatures in your Circum&s;tances, and con&s;equently, what you can well account for, <HI>in Point of Prudence,</HI> to your own Minds and to the World. And, I &s;uppo&s;e, many of indeed the mo&s;t that have for&s;aken us, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, have acted upon this Principle, and gone off to the Church, rather from the Notion of it's being a good <HI>Pruden|tial,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="006158_0044_1027F909068D8550">than from any Thought of it's being nece&s;&s;ary in Point of ab&s;olute Duty. You have acted upon Opinion that the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> and <HI>Practices</HI> of the Epi&s;copal Church are well calculated to promote the temporal and eternal Intere&s;ts of Mankind; and even better &s;uited to an&s;wer the&s;e great In|tentions, than the Con&s;titution and Practices of the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> Now I apprehend that this is a <HI>great</HI> and a <HI>dangerous</HI> Mi&s;take; and if I can convince you of this, I tru&s;t, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you will retract what you have acted on this Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of Things. And with an earne&s;t De|&s;ire, and &s;ome Hope of this, I now invite you to a <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>impartial Con&s;ideration</HI> of the Matter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> thinks him&s;elf able to ju&s;tify your Conduct, in this View of it. <HI>p.</HI> 34. <Q><HI>Tho&s;e that propagate the Church of</HI> England <HI>in</HI> Connecticut, <HI>would not put them&s;elves to</HI> &s;o many Difficulties, <HI>and take</HI> &s;o much Pains, <HI>if they did not believe the Glory of God and the Welfare of many Souls, were to be promoted thereby; nor &s;hould we endeavour to pro&s;elite &s;ome, if we did not believe it the Duty and</HI> INTEREST <HI>of all to become Pro&s;elites. and that it would be every Way for the</HI> Benefit and Advantage of the Country; <HI>for the pre&s;ent Age, and for Po&s;terity, to have all Parties and Sects laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ide, and the national Con&s;titution &s;ubmitted to.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is one Thing in this Paragraph, I could wi&s;h Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> had omitted, becau&s;e Reply to it may &s;eem <HI>invidi|ous;</HI> but as he has thrown it in my Way, I think, I ought not to let it pa&s;s without a Remark.&mdash;I mean his repre&s;ent|ing tho&s;e who propagate the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> as encountering "&s;o MANY DIFFICULTIES, and taking SO MUCH PAINS." A Stranger to this Colony might from this think, that our <HI>epi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> tho' they were Men of the mo&s;t <HI>unwearied Application</HI> to the Duties of the Of|fice, were <HI>&s;tarving</HI> for want of Support; or <HI>&s;uffered Per&s;ecu|tion</HI> from the Government they live under, and were <HI>remar|kable</HI> for the <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> with which they encoun|tred their <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing Difficulties.</HI> And I am &s;orry to &s;ay

<P>But the Thing principally to be regarded, in the Pa&s;&s;age under Con&s;ideration, is Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s repre&s;enting it as <Q><HI>every Way for the Benefit and Advantage of the Country, for the pre&s;ent Age, and for Po&s;terity,</HI></Q> that we &s;hould become Pro&s;elites to the Church of <HI>England</HI> Now if he be able to prove this, I mu&s;t own that it would be <HI>prudent</HI> for us all to

Would it not have been much more prudent for you to have remained in our Communion, which would have &s;ecured you in your ju&s;t and very valuable Right of chu&s;ing your own Mini&s;ters?</P>
<P>You will, it may be, tell me, That you do now choo&s;e your Mini&s;ters as well as we. And I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Society</HI> have <HI>generally</HI> appointed the Per&s;on you a&s;ked for. But what &s;ort of Security can you have that they will always do &s;o? It is per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> for them to do otherwi&s;e; and &s;end you what Mini&s;ters they plea&s;e, without at all regarding your Petitions or <HI>Re|commendations:</HI> Tho' it may not be quite &s;o <HI>politic</HI> for them to exert this Authority over you, 'till you are a little fa&s;ter fixed in the Principles you have but newly embraced. And if there were Occa&s;ion for it, I could produce In&s;tances of the <HI>Society</HI>'s appointing Mini&s;ters for particular Places, with|out the People's recommending the Per&s;ons, or &s;o much as knowing them before they were &s;ent; and &s;uch Per&s;ons too, in &s;ome In&s;tances, as no religious Man would have recom|mended, or could &s;it ea&s;y under.</P>
<P>But if it happen that you have a Mini&s;ter worthy of his Office, how much &s;oever you may like the Man, whatever Expence you may have been at, in &s;ending him for Orders, and &s;ettling him among you, How little Security have you of
<PB N="59" REF="006158_0058_1027F932D9250AD0">his Continuance with you, or even of your being allowed to &s;hew your Rea&s;ons why he &s;hould not be removed from you? This I mentioned in the marginal Note annexed to my SERMON, <HI>p.</HI> 24. <Q>This Want of Di&s;cipline is &s;ome|times &s;een and complained of by the Laity of that Church; as for In&s;tance, when their Mini&s;ters are removed from them without any &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, nay, when the Peo|ple think they have &s;uch Objections as would effectually prevent a Removal, if they could find any Body to judge between them and their Mini&s;ters.</Q> When I wrote this I had <HI>particular In&s;tances</HI> in my Mind; and &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Hint</HI> was plain enough to lead your Thoughts to the &s;ame In|&s;tances; e&s;pecially as one of them had then newly happened, and was the Subject of much Conver&s;ation, and a great deal of Complaint among &s;ome of you at that Time. I expected therefore that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> would have attempted a Vindi|cation of it. But he judged it <HI>&s;afe&s;t</HI> for him to &s;ay nothing at all upon the Head; and, I own, it was prudent in him &s;o endeavour to <HI>hu&s;h</HI> &s;uch Matters; for they are what no wi&s;e Man will ever undertake to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Omitting the In&s;tances of this Kind at <HI>New-London, Nor|walk, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall mention only that at <HI>Fairfield.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hen|ry Caner</HI> was &s;ettled, by the <HI>Society</HI> Mini&s;ter to a &s;mall Epi&s;|copal Congregation in this Town about twenty Years ago. He, from Time to Time, wrote the Society Accounts of his <HI>great Succe&s;s.</HI> The Congregation increa&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree that they were obliged, he &s;aid, to build Galleries in the Church, &s;ufficient to contain <HI>an hundred</HI> People. The Ac|count, as printed in the <HI>Ab&s;tract of the Society's Proceedings,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>two hundred:</HI> But as I am informed that Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> corrected the printed Account with his Pen, in the Copy he lent; and as I have no De&s;ire to <HI>aggravate</HI> the Matter, I mention the Number as he corrected it. Some Time after he mentioned to the Society the building of a new Church at <HI>Fairfield,</HI> and gave this as the Rea&s;on of it, <HI>"The old one being much too little for the Congregation".</HI> At the &s;ame Time he de&s;cribed his Pari&s;hioners as <HI>"a very good-natur'd indu&s;|trious
<PB N="60" REF="006158_0059_1027F936CC41AA30">People,</HI> that <HI>well de&s;erv'd the Society's Favour",</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>"the Number of his Communicants is</HI> Eighty two"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Ab&s;t. of the Bp. of <HI>Gloce&s;ters</HI> Ser. <HI>p.</HI> 51.</NOTE>. If he means he had <HI>this Number</HI> of Communicants in <HI>Fairfield,</HI> as I conclude the Society, and the World under&s;tood him, for he gives a di&s;tinct Account of the Church at <HI>Norwalk</HI> afterwards, in the &s;ame Letter: If, I &s;ay, he is thus to be under&s;tood, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that he admitted Infants to the <HI>Communion,</HI> for he never had, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that Number of adult Per&s;ons for his &s;tated Hearers. His People here are &s;o far from allowing that Want of Room in the old Church was the Occa&s;ion of building the New; that &s;ome of them of good Credit have declared that the old Hou&s;e, even without Galleries, was more than &s;ufficient for the Congregation. And that except <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch extraordinary Sea|&s;on, they were not at all crouded on the Ground Floor. They &s;ay, they built the new Church at a great Expence, to accommodate Mr. <HI>Caner,</HI> by having it near his Habitation; and &s;ome of them, that in Con&s;ideration of their doing this, and to enduce them to it, he promi&s;ed, that he would never remove from them. But this notwith&s;tanding, on his receiving an Invitation to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> he immediately determined to leave them, and without waiting for Orders from the Bi&s;hop or So|ciety removed to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and was formally inducted there. I don't pretend to a <HI>certain</HI> Knowledge of all the&s;e Facts, but have recited them as People of that Church, whom I take to be worthy of Credit, have repre&s;ented them. And whether they are true or fal&s;e, the People who believe them, and look upon them&s;elves injured by them, ought in all Rea&s;on and <HI>Equity,</HI> to have had an Opportunity of producing what Evi|dence they had to &s;upport them, before &s;ome proper and competent Judge. And that eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution which does not allow of, and make Provi&s;ion for this, can never recommend it&s;elf to any rea&s;onable Man. What, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> can you think it <HI>prudent</HI> to &s;ubmit to a Con&s;titution, on which your Mini&s;ters, when you have been at ever &s;o
<PB N="61" REF="006158_0060_1027F93852EAD5A0">much Charge in obtaining and &s;ettling them, may leave you when they plea&s;e, without having any Per&s;on to judge be|tween you and them!</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>State of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline</HI> in the Epi&s;copal Churches in <HI>America,</HI> renders it <HI>inexpedient</HI> for us to go over to their Communion.</P>
<P>Di&s;cipline is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of the Church, as any other In&s;titution of the Go&s;pel. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> allows the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, <HI>p.</HI> 27. and he labours pretty hard to prove that you have and exerci&s;e it in your Churches. And rather than own this your great and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Defect, he has contrived a Di&s;cipline for you, which has no Foundation in the Go&s;pel, and is really a great wor&s;e than none. I in|tend under my la&s;t general Head to &s;hew, That there is hard|ly a Shadow of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline in the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> at Home, and &s;till le&s;s (if le&s;s can be) in the epi&s;copal Congregations in <HI>America,</HI> and to urge this as an Argument again&s;t the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of our embracing that Communion. But as I now con&s;ider the Matter in a <HI>merely prudential</HI> View, I will, for once &s;uppo&s;e that you have &s;ome Di&s;cipline among you, I will take Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s own Account of the Nature of it; and &s;ee what Rea&s;on you have to value it, and how far you recommend your <HI>Prudence</HI> to the World in &s;ubmitting to it.</P>
<P>He tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 26. of <Q>a Commi&s;&s;ion large enough, gi|ven to &s;uch Mini&s;ters as have the Care of <HI>American</HI> Con|gregations, to enable them, in GOD'S Name, and in Be|half of CHRIST, to do every Thing that Men's comfor|table Hopes and Happine&s;s require to be done; altho' they act in Subordination, and are obliged to pay a proper Deference to their Superiours the Bi&s;hops.</Q> He goes on, after allowing what he calls a <HI>Chiefty</HI> to the Bi&s;hops, (which un|u&s;ual and ambiguous Word, by the Way, means every thing, or nothing, as Occa&s;ion requires) to &s;ay, <HI>p.</HI> 27. <Q>The Pre&s;|byters &s;ubordinate to them, have as much Power in the Go|vernment of their &s;everal Flocks, as Wi&s;dom and Pru|dence
<PB N="62" REF="006158_0061_1027F939F363EDF8">can think proper to entru&s;t them with.</Q> Hitherto he is extremely cautious, and talks wholly in general Terms. I wi&s;h he had been a little more particular, and told us plainly, Whether a Pre&s;byter in <HI>England</HI> be liable to be pu|ni&s;hed as Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> (mentioned in my <HI>Sermon</HI>) was for pretending to exerci&s;e Di&s;cipline on a &s;candalous Pari&s;hioner; and if &s;o, whether their Pre&s;byters in <HI>America</HI> have a larger Commi&s;&s;ion than tho&s;e in <HI>England.</HI> For if the&s;e Things be as I &s;uppo&s;e they are, this &s;ame <HI>Chiefty</HI> in the Bi&s;hops is (what the Word may well enough &s;ignify) a real <HI>Sov'reignty.</HI> And then Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> mu&s;t mean, that as much Power of this Kind <HI>"as Wi&s;dom and Prudence can think proper to entru&s;t"</HI> the Pre&s;byters of the Church of <HI>England</HI> with, is, in reallity, none at all. Thus I &s;hould have been apt to under&s;tand him, were it not for what follows, <Q>Nay we can &s;ay, even as <HI>Jerom</HI> to <HI>Evagrius, Quid facit Epi&s;copus, quod Pre&s;byter, non faciat, excepta Ordinatione.</HI></Q> This &s;ets the Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter <HI>upon a Par,</HI> in every Thing except Ordination; and con&s;equently reduces the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Chiefty</HI> in Government and Di&s;cipline to what I believe it ought to be reduced to, ju&s;t nothing at all.</P>
<P>Having thus, to &s;erve the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, exalted the Pre&s;byter's Authority to &s;o high a Pitch, as to make him <HI>equal to the Bi&s;hop, in the Affair of Di&s;cipline,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 28. <Q><HI>That &s;uch Affairs</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> all di&s;ciplinary Affairs) <HI>are left with the Mini&s;ter to determine, according to his be&s;t Prudence, with the Authority belonging to his Office.</HI></Q> But then, tho' it is not quite con&s;i&s;tent with his adopting <HI>Jerom</HI>'s Saying, he would re&s;erve &s;ome Superiory, to the Bi&s;hop in this Ca&s;e; But &s;uch an one as will be of no Service to you. He don't allow of an <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Bi&s;hop, but on|ly a <HI>Complaint</HI> again&s;t the injurious Prie&s;t. His Words are, That the Prie&s;t <Q>has only to expect, that his Doings may be referred to his Bi&s;hop; unto who&s;e Judgment he mu&s;t &s;ubmit, as well as the <HI>Party complaining,</HI> when Time will give Leave to obtain it.</Q> Thus then the Matter &s;tands according to him, every Mini&s;ter of the Church of
<PB N="63" REF="006158_0062_1027F93CBB45E3A0"><HI>England</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> has the <HI>full and &s;ole Authority</HI> of Di&s;ci|pline, over all his Pari&s;hioners. The Per&s;on he cen&s;ures can't <HI>appeal</HI> from his Judgment, but may <HI>refer</HI> the Matter to the Bi&s;hop, <HI>by Way of Complaint</HI> again&s;t his Mini&s;ter; and &s;o be releived when Time will give Leave to obtain his Lord|&s;hip's Judgment.</P>
<P>But if this be really the Ca&s;e, you mu&s;t give me Leave to think, you are under the mo&s;t <HI>arbitrary</HI> Government that e|ver obtained in the chri&s;tian World; and excu&s;e me, if I can't po&s;&s;ibly entertain any <HI>high Opinion</HI> of your <HI>Prudence</HI> in &s;ubmitting to it. This is really, what Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> injuri|ou&s;ly objects to us, "to have Judges of <HI>A&s;&s;ize</HI> and <HI>Oyer and Terminer</HI> in every Pari&s;h"; and which I fully agree with him, in &s;aying, "I believe few People will be fond of". <HI>p.</HI> 27. This <HI>ill contrived</HI> and <HI>unhappy</HI> Scheme of his, will undoubtedly &s;ubject People's chri&s;tian Rights and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Priviledges to the arbitrary Di&s;po&s;al of a Set of <Q><HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical chief Judges, many of whom have not Capacity to decide a Contro|ver&s;y of thirteen pence half-penny</HI></Q> And this is an Event not more likely to happen in any Church in the World, than among you: For you have no Voice in choo&s;ing your own Mini&s;ters, and the Society, as &s;ome of the Sermons they pub|li&s;h inform us, appoint not &s;uch Mini&s;ters as they could wi&s;h, but &s;uch as they can procure to go abroad, on the &s;mall En|couragement they are able to give. It may not be improper on this Occa&s;ion, to put you in Mind of the known Story of of the Clergyman in <HI>England,</HI> who accepted a Mi&s;&s;ion in one of the Plantations. And being advi&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop to pro|vide him&s;elf well with Cloathing, &s;ince he was going into a Country where it was dear, and particularly to carry two or three Dozen Shirts; reply'd, <HI>Two or three Dozen Shirts!</HI> Alas, my Lord, had I known how to procure half a Dozen, I &s;hould never have thought of going as a Mi&s;&s;ionary into <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>This Scheme of Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s, I &s;ay, &s;ubjects you to the arbitrary Judgment of your Mini&s;ters; for he &s;ays the Mi|ni&s;ter is left <HI>"to determine according to his be&s;t Prudence".</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="006158_0063_1027F940D3803000">And the Right of complaining to the Bi&s;hop, will with Re|gard to <HI>nine in ten</HI> of you, &s;ignify nothing, or afford no Relief. The Bi&s;hop is a <HI>thou&s;and Leagues</HI> di&s;tant; and if you &s;end o|ver your Complaint, his Lord&s;hip has not Lei&s;ure to examine the Complaint and Evidences him&s;elf; it mu&s;t go therefore to the &s;piritual Court: And who of you would be at the Trouble or Expence of pro&s;ecuting your Mini&s;ter in &s;uch a Court, or could expect any Succe&s;s in &s;uch a Suit? Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> therefore well enough expre&s;&s;es it, when he &s;ays, the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t in this Ca&s;e, &s;ubmit to the Judgment of his Bi&s;hop, <HI>"when Time will give Leave to obtain it".</HI> And this, if you put the Matter to the Trial, will be found to mean <HI>never.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> can you con&s;ent that a Stranger, one that perhaps left <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> for want of Bread, &s;hould be intru&s;ted with the <HI>&s;ole Right</HI> of admitting to and excluding from the &s;acred Privileges of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible King|dom? Are you willing to be looked upon and treated either as Chri&s;tians, or as <HI>Heathen Men and Publicans,</HI> according to the <HI>arbitrary</HI> Judgment of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Per&s;on?</P>
<P>This Tyranny, for &s;uch it truly is, we have the be&s;t Se|curity again&s;t in our Communion; in which the Mini&s;ter can cen&s;ure no one Per&s;on, without the <HI>Con&s;ent of the Bre|thren</HI> in the &s;ame Church. Thus the Man is treated like an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> and a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> he is always <HI>tried by his Peers,</HI> and if he has Wrong done him, may &s;peedily and ea&s;ily obtain a Re-hearing of his Cau&s;e before an <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council.</HI> And certainly he will never recommend his <HI>Prudence</HI> to the impar|tial World, who, under the Notion of Expediency, for&s;akes a Church wherein he enjoyed &s;uch <HI>invaluable</HI> Privileges, and embraces a Communion which &s;ubjects him to &s;o arbitrary and <HI>intolerable a Di&s;cipline</HI> as this.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Conforming to the Church of <HI>England</HI> tends to bring the Plantations into an <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary and hurtful State of De|pendance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="006158_0064_1027F943B1018070">
The&s;e Plantations are, and of Right ought to be, dependent on the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in all their <HI>civil</HI> Concerns. And whatever the Enemies of the Plantations may report at Home, of the Danger of their ca&s;ting off their Dependence, I believe it may with Truth be affirmed, that there is not a Man of Sen&s;e in them all, but what is willing, nay, would chu&s;e to continue in this State.

<P>There are many di&s;advantagious Con&s;equences ju&s;tly to be apprehended in this Ca&s;e.

And by <HI>prac|tical Religion,</HI> I mean Conformity of Heart to the moral Per|fections of God, evidenced by a &s;trict and con&s;ciencious Ob|&s;ervation of the divine Laws. This is truly an important Que&s;tion, and de&s;erves your &s;erious Con&s;ideration. Religion is de&s;igned to recover Men from the &s;ad Effects of their A|po&s;tacy from God, to make them holy, humble, meek and loving in the Temper of their Minds, devout Wor&s;hippers of God, and really good Men; exactly ju&s;t, and exten&s;ively charitable in their Dealings with all Men; and &s;ober, cha&s;te and temperate in their whole Conduct; u&s;eful Members of human Society at pre&s;ent, and meet for angelic and divine Society in the World to come. So far as it produces the&s;e Effects it is plainly advantagious to Men&punc; But, on the con|trary, <HI>if the Light that is in</HI> them <HI>be Darkne&s;s, How great is that Darkne&s;s?</HI> If that which they call Religion makes them wor&s;e, more vicious in their Temper and Conduct; what|ever
<PB N="68" REF="006158_0067_1027F94DF51ADD28"><HI>lofty Epithets</HI> they may be&s;tow upon the Religion they profe&s;s, 'tis plain that it had, on the Whole, been better for them to have been without it.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian Religion is wi&s;ely and excellently &s;uited to an&s;wer it's great Intentions in the Hearts and Lives of Men. And when it does not produce the&s;e Effects, and e&s;pecially when it produces the contrary, there is Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that it is very much corrupted. The famous <HI>Apologi&s;ts</HI> for Chri&s;|tianity in it's early Days, in&s;i&s;t much on this Argument in it's Favour, that it reformed Men; that tho&s;e who were <HI>vicious</HI> before they embraced it, became <HI>virtuous</HI> afterward; and that Chri&s;tians were really <HI>better Men</HI> that tho&s;e of any other Religion. And I don't remember that <HI>Cel&s;us, Porphyry</HI> or even <HI>Julian</HI> ever told them in Reply, that their &s;aying &s;o proceeded from <Q><HI>that Bigotry and Self-Admiration, which the Zealots among every Sort of enthu&s;ia&s;tic Sectaries, are re|markably ting'd with</HI>;</Q> or that it was the Effect of a <HI>"ra&s;h cen&s;orious Temper again&s;t tho&s;e whom they di&s;approved"</HI> nor accu&s;ed them of <Q><HI>Phari&s;ee-like plea&s;ing them&s;elves with Compari&s;ons between their own Sect and all others; overlook|ing their own Hypocri&s;y and dete&s;table Vices, and pa&s;&s;ing &s;e|vere Cen&s;ures upon other's Faults.</HI></Q> Or if any of them did make &s;uch Replies, there was ju&s;t as much <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Argu|ment</HI> in them, as there is in Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s &s;aying all this to me. <HI>p.</HI> 31.</P>
<P>We have no <HI>infallible</HI> Rule whereby to judge of &s;uch fu|ture Things, as do not depend on a certain and known Con|nection between Cau&s;es and Effects; which is perhaps the Ca&s;e in every thing of a moral Nature. There are, however, Ways of forming a <HI>rational Judgment</HI> in the&s;e Ca&s;es; and this may be &s;o well founded as to be a proper and ju&s;tifiable Rule of Action, to a rea&s;onable Creature accountable for his Conduct. It may amount to a <HI>moral Certainty,</HI> and we &s;hall be inexcu&s;able, in the Sight of God and Man, if we do not act upon it; much more, if we act in Oppo&s;ition to it. The <HI>be&s;t Way</HI> of judging with Regard to future Events, is to look back and enquire what Effects &s;uch and &s;uch Cau&s;es
<PB N="69" REF="006158_0068_1027F94F8241F508">have already produced. And if we find <HI>&s;uch Events</HI> have commonly appeared upon <HI>&s;uch Things</HI> being done, we con|clude there is the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect betwen them, tho' we can't always &s;ee the Connection. And hence we <HI>rationally</HI> judge, that if &s;uch Actions be now or hereafter done, &s;uch Effects will follow; unle&s;s we can di&s;cern &s;ome|thing <HI>&s;pecial</HI> in the Ca&s;e, that probably will prevent it.</P>
<P>This is the Way of judging I u&s;e, and would per&s;wade you to u&s;e in deciding the Que&s;tion now before us. Would you you form a rational Judgment, what Effect adhering to the Doctrines, Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip of our Churches will have on practical Religion, look back and &s;ee what the Effect has formerly been; or would you judge what will be the Con&s;e|quence of a general Conformity to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> look abroad in the World, and con&s;ider the State of practical Religion in tho&s;e Places that have for a long Time been wholly, or chiefly of that Profe&s;&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;eems very much at a Lo&s;s what Reply to make on this Head, and attempts rather to <HI>evade</HI> than to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> the Argument. At <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> he endeavours to <HI>di&s;grace</HI> it, by repre&s;enting it as a Piece of <HI>Phari&s;aical O&s;tentation. Then,</HI> he would <HI>prejudice</HI> his Readers again&s;t it, by &s;aying, that it has been the common Pretence of every new Sect, from the Days of the <HI>Browni&s;ts</HI> down to the late&s;t <HI>New-Light Exhorters.</HI> In the <HI>next</HI> Place, he propo&s;es &s;ome <HI>Difficulties</HI> in the Way, and would repre|&s;ent it <HI>impracticable</HI> to make a fair Compari&s;on in the Ca&s;e; he a&s;ks <HI>"Who &s;hall hold the Ballance"?</HI> and &s;ays, of making a Compari&s;on, <HI>"if it could well be done".</HI> And yet, <HI>after all,</HI> he pretends the Argument is really in his Favour. But why all this <HI>Shuffling</HI> and <HI>Eva&s;ion?</HI> If there be nothing at all in the Argument, why did not he plainly tell you, that it was a Matter of Indifference whether you chu&s;e a Religion that would make you better, or one that would make you wor&s;e? Why &s;hould any Per&s;on be prejudiced again&s;t an Argument, becau&s;e Men have pretended to ju&s;tify them&s;elves by it, who had no Right to it, and again&s;t whom it concluded with it's full Force? But who will believe that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> thought
<PB N="70" REF="006158_0069_1027F95163E218A0">this Argument really in his Favour, when he has taken &s;o much Pains to di&s;grace it, and prejudice his Readers again&s;t it? This affords the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t Pre&s;umption</HI> that he was con&s;cious, that, on a fair Compari&s;on, the Advantage would be clearly on our Side.</P>
<P>I am at no Difficulty in an&s;wering that Que&s;tion, <HI>"Who &s;hall hold the Ballance"?</HI> Were I actuated by a <HI>Party Spirit,</HI> di&s;puting merely for Victory, or re&s;olving to maintain my Cau&s;e right or wrong, I &s;hould, no Doubt, chu&s;e to refer it to &s;uch Judges as I thought favourable to it; be &s;ure I &s;hould not be &s;o impolitic, as to chu&s;e the known Adver&s;aries of my Cau&s;e to decide it. But as this is not the Ca&s;e with me, I willingly and <HI>of Choice</HI> refer the Matter to your own Con|&s;ciences. You, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> &s;hall be Judges in this whole Controver&s;y between us. And 'tis for this Rea&s;on that I chu&s;e to write in the Form of an <HI>Addre&s;s to you.</HI> Con&s;ider the Matter impartially, exerci&s;e a proper Concern for the temporal and eternal Intere&s;ts of your&s;elves and your Po&s;te|rity, and then &s;eriou&s;ly put this Que&s;tion to your&s;elves, are you really willing that NEW-ENGLAND &s;hould become, in Point of Religion, a BARBADOS or a JAMAICA, and let Con&s;cience give the deci&s;ive An&s;wer.</P>
<P>This Compari&s;on is ea&s;ily made, for there are few of our Towns but what have &s;ome Per&s;ons worthy of Credit, who have been in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, of whom you may en|quire concerning the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of Religion that are to be found there. And the Compari&s;on is unexceptio|nably fair. The&s;e <HI>I&s;lands</HI> have for a long Time had the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;ettled in them. <HI>Barbados</HI> in particular, is wholly laid out into Pari&s;hes; has Churches built, and Mi|ni&s;ters officiating in them. And they are both, I think wholly (to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ure chiefly) Epi&s;copal. This Country, on the contrary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as been wholly <HI>Antiepi&s;copal,</HI> and at this Day the <HI>Epi&s;coparians</HI> bear an incon&s;iderable Proportion to the Body of the People.

His propo&s;ing &s;uch an <HI>impracticable Compari&s;on</HI> as this, could have no other De&s;ign than to divert you from that ju&s;t and ea&s;y one I had &s;tated.

Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> may flout as much as he plea&s;es, at "<HI>the &s;elf-admiring Saints of</HI> New-England", and gently touch the <HI>abominable Vices</HI> that abound in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and if the&s;e Things afford him any Satisfaction in his &s;ober and retired Hours, I &s;hall not endeavour to deprive him of it.

<P>As to what he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 34. of <Q><HI>the late &s;candalous Efforts of &s;atanic Zeal",</HI> and "<HI>the Ob&s;tructions and Checks they met with from the Church of</HI> England <HI>Congregations</HI>;</Q> I reply, that Errors and Di&s;orders he refers to, did very much ari&s;e from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and were an <HI>unhap|py Imitation</HI> of the Conduct of it's Clergy. The <HI>Arminian|i&s;m</HI> which they had &s;pread in the Country did as naturally beget the late <HI>Antinomian</HI> Errors, as one Extreme produces a|nother. The fir&s;t <HI>Itinerants</HI> I ever knew were <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> from the <HI>Society for propagating the Go&s;pel.</HI> The Doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t our Mini&s;ters and Churches are neither Mini&s;ters nor Churches of Chri&s;t, and that therefore it was lawful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Chri&s;tians to renounce and &s;eparate from them, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> preached by the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and from them the late and pre&s;ent <HI>Seducers</HI> learnt the Art of <HI>fi&s;hing in troubled Waters,</HI> vi&s;iting &s;uch Places as were in Con|tention, and heading every Party that &s;at them&s;elves up in Oppo&s;ition to the Mini&s;ter or Church they belonged to. I wi&s;h the&s;e Gentlemen had oppo&s;ed the late Errors as &s;ome o|thers did, not by in&s;i&s;ting on the contrary Errors, but by du|ly explaining the great Truths of the Go&s;pel, which the&s;e ir|regular Per&s;ons either mi&s;took or abu&s;ed. But as <HI>they</HI> have managed the Matter, I fear Religion is thrown into a <HI>chroni|cal Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> by their Method of curing it of an <HI>accute one;</HI> as an un&s;kilful Phy&s;ician, to cure his Patient of a <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> &s;ome|times takes away &s;o much of his Blood and Spirits, as brings
<PB N="73" REF="006158_0072_1027F95AF9867C78">on an <HI>incurable Con&s;umption.</HI> Upon the Whole, I am of the Opinion, that had there been no <HI>Epi&s;copal Congregations</HI> a|mong us, the late Di&s;orders would either never have ari&s;en, or been carried off in a much better Manner.</P>
<P>There is but one Thing more to be con&s;idered under this Head. Mr. <HI>Wetmore,</HI> tho' he can't deny the Fact, that <HI>practical Religion</HI> decays among us &s;ince the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> has been introduced; will have it that I mi&s;take the Cau&s;e. <HI>p.</HI> 33. <Q><HI>If Mr.</HI> Hobart <HI>(&s;ays he) had well under|&s;tood the true Cau&s;e and Springs from which the Immorality, Athei&s;m and Profanene&s;s of the pre&s;ent Age is derived, he could never have imputed it to any Defects in the Con&s;titution of the Church of</HI> England.</Q> In An&s;wer to this I will not in&s;i&s;t on the <HI>Want of Di&s;cipline</HI> in that Church, tho' I look upon it as one of the principal Cau&s;es of the&s;e Things, be|cau&s;e I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider this more at large, under the la&s;t general Head. I will therefore at pre&s;ent on|ly ob&s;erve, That the not altering the publick Forms in the Liturgy, according to the Changes that happen in the Circum|&s;tances and Cu&s;toms of Mankind, appears to me as one great Cau&s;e of the <HI>Irreligion</HI> that prevails in the Nation. I &s;hall il|lu&s;trate this Remark by giving an In&s;tance or two of it.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Church Catechi&s;m</HI> was compo&s;ed, all Children had <HI>God-Fathers</HI> and <HI>God-Mothers;</HI> private Bapti&s;ms were not practi&s;ed unle&s;s in Ca&s;es of apparent Danger, and if the Child recovered, he was brought forth afterwards, and had <HI>Spon&s;ors</HI> to an&s;wer for him. But the Ca&s;e is now very dif|ferent, and e&s;pecially in this Country. Many of the Chil|dren catechized at Church, were baptized among us; many more were <HI>privately</HI> baptized, the Parents chu&s;ing this from a Scruple concerning the Sign of the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m. It has been a common Practice among you, to teach <HI>&s;uch</HI> Children the Church Catechi&s;m; and you have no other Form of In|&s;truction for them. To u&s;e this Form is to teach &s;uch Children direct Fal&s;ities in plain Matters of Fact, as a Part of religious Education. And &s;urely that mu&s;t be the direct Way to make them profane and irreligious. This I mentioned in
<PB N="74" REF="006158_0073_1027F95DDB26CA58">my <HI>Sermon,</HI> in An&s;wer to which Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is &s;o far from vindicating your Conduct, that he does not pretend either to <HI>deny</HI> or <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the Fact: But implicitly gives up the Cau&s;e; for he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 41. <Q><HI>It might be more proper to begin with the Creed,</HI> or el&s;e to a&s;k,&mdash;<HI>What An&s;wer do the Children of the Church give, when a&s;ked who gave you that Name</HI>?</Q> Who would have tho't that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;hould be the Man to <HI>"open a refining Shop"</HI> to melt down and new Coin the public Formula's of the Church?

<P>The Church of <HI>England,</HI> by her 59th CANON, requires all her Mini&s;ters, <Q><HI>on every Sunday and Holiday before Even|ing Prayer, for Half an Hoar or more, to examine and in|&s;truct the Youth and ignorant Per&s;ons of his Pari&s;h, in the ten Commandments, the Articles of the Belief, and the Lord's Prayer; and diligently to hear, in&s;truct and teach them in the</HI> Catechi&s;m &s;et forth in the Book of Common Prayer.</Q> I don't &s;ee but the Mini&s;ter is obliged to keep to the <HI>Form</HI> in <HI>Catechi&s;ing</HI> as much as in <HI>Praying:</HI> And <HI>changing</HI> or <HI>omitting</HI> any Part &s;eems as little allowed in one Ca&s;e as in the other. The Penalty for the Mini&s;ter's neglecting <HI>thus to catechize,</HI> on the third Conviction, is <HI>Excommunication.</HI> And <HI>"Fathers, Mothers, Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es neglecting their Duties"</HI> in not &s;ending <HI>"their Children, Servants or Apprentices"</HI> to be thus catechized, are to be &s;u&s;pended, and if they per&s;i&s;t herein by the Space of a Month, to be excommunicated. Notwith|&s;tanding therefore the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been &s;o often boa&s;ted of as the <HI>mo&s;t perfect</HI> and <HI>be&s;t con&s;tituted Church;</HI> I think it plain, that if her Con&s;titution be received by us, without con&s;iderable Amendments, we &s;hall find our&s;elves o|bliged, under Pain of Excommunication, to &s;uch Things as are <HI>unlawful</HI> in them&s;elves, and in their Con&s;equences <HI>de|&s;tructive to the Morals</HI> of our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> could produce Authority for mending the Form of catechi&s;ing, which, as appears from the <HI>Canon</HI> cited, is a <HI>Part of the publick Service of the Church,</HI> to be u&s;ed upon all Sundays and Holidays; yet the <HI>Amendments</HI> he propo&s;es

To change the Que&s;tion, and a&s;k, <HI>"What An&s;wer do the Chil|dren of the Church give, when a&s;ked, who gave you that Name"?</HI> would be very improper in the Ca&s;e of &s;uch Children as have received the Bapti&s;m of the Church in Private; for &s;ince the Church declares the&s;e <HI>lawfully and &s;ufficiently baptized",</HI> I hope Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> would not have them look upon them|&s;elves <HI>"but in the Order of Catechumens".</HI> And indeed this Way of propo&s;ing the Que&s;tions to any Children is ridi|culous.

<P>The other In&s;tance I &s;hall produce to &s;hew, that the not altering public Forms, &s;o as to accommodate them to the Circum&s;tances and prevailing Cu&s;toms of the World, tends to introduce Irreligion and Prophanene&s;s; &s;hall be taken from the Office of <HI>Matrimony.</HI> When this Office was com|po&s;ed, it was the general (I &s;uppo&s;e the univer&s;al) Practice of the Nation, to marry upon the Foot of the common Law of <HI>England,</HI> which gives the Wife a Right of <HI>Dower</HI> in her Hu&s;band's E&s;tate. It was therefore well enough for the Man to &s;ay, <HI>"with all my Worldly Goods I thee endow",</HI> for he really meant as he &s;aid. The Cu&s;toms of the Nation are &s;o very much alter'd &s;ince that Time, that perhaps there is not now one Marriage in ten, among People of Fa&s;hion and E&s;tate, without a <HI>Jointure,</HI> that is, &s;ome Certainty &s;ettled up|on the Woman in&s;tead of the <HI>Right of Dower.</HI> Thus a Man and Woman agree before Marriage, that in Ca&s;e &s;he outlives him, &s;he &s;hall have a certain Sum of Money, or the Rents of &s;uch an E&s;tate during her natural Life, <HI>in Con&s;ideration of which &s;he quits the Right of Dower,</HI> which the Law would otherwi&s;e give her. But tho' the Practice is thus changed, the Form of Matrimony is not changed. And therefore when a Man and Woman have &s;olemnly agreed under Hand and Seal, that &s;he &s;hall <HI>not be endowed,</HI> or have any Right of Dower in
<PB N="77" REF="006158_0076_1027F96683F4FC38">his E&s;tate, they go into the Church, and the Man, taught by the Prie&s;t, &s;ays to the Woman,&mdash;<Q><HI>With all my worldly Goods I thee endow, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></Q> Thus is the <HI>&s;acred Name</HI> of God taken in vain in a great Part of the Marriages in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e in many In&s;tances in this Country, where there are frequently Marriages contracted between <HI>Slaves.</HI> I have been informed that &s;ome of your Mini&s;ters u&s;e this Form in <HI>&s;uch</HI> Marriages, and the Laws of the <HI>Church of Eng|land</HI> do, I think, evidently oblige them to it; CAN. 62. <Q>No Mini&s;ter upon Pain of Su&s;pen&s;ion, <HI>per Triennium ip&s;o Facto,</HI> &s;hall celebrate Matrimony between any Per&s;ons without a Faculty or Licen&s;e&mdash;except the Banns of Matrimony have been fir&s;t publi&s;hed three &s;everal Sundays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nei|ther &s;hall any Mini&s;ter, upon the like Pain, under any Pretence what&s;oever, join any Per&s;ons&mdash;in Marriage&mdash;but only between the Hours of Eight and Twelve in the Forenoon, nor in any private Place, but either in the Church or Chapel where one of them dwelleth, and like|wi&s;e in Time of divine Service.</Q> Thus Marriage is, ac|cording to the <HI>Canon,</HI> to be celebrated in the Church, in Time of divine Service; and I think it is allowed on all Hands, that the <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> required by the 36th CANON, obliges to the U&s;e of the Forms in the Common Prayer Book, <HI>in all public Admini&s;trations in the Church.</HI> But now if one of your Mini&s;ters, joining a couple of <HI>Negro Slaves</HI> in Marriage, &s;hall teach the Man to &s;ay to the Woman, <Q><HI>With all my worldly Goods I thee endow, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>;</Q> when he and all pre&s;ent know, that neither of them have, or are capable of having Pro|perty in any thing whatever; the <HI>loo&s;er Part</HI> of the Auditory would probably look upon it as a <HI>&s;olemn Farc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and be hardened in Impiety and Prophanene&s;s by it; while all who have a pro|per <HI>Reverence</HI> for that &s;acred Name in which they were bap|tized, mu&s;t find <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Horror</HI> ari&s;ing in their Minds on hearing it thus <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> in the Time and Place of divine

<P>THE THIRD QUESTION.</P>
<P>Whether it be LAWFUL for particular Members of <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Churches, to &s;eparate from them, and join in Communion with the Epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies in the Coun|try?</P>
<P>By <HI>Members of the New-Engli&s;h Churches,</HI> I mean, not only actual Communicants, but all that have been born and bred, baptized and educated in them. The&s;e all are in &s;ome Sen&s;e, tho' not in the highe&s;t Sen&s;e, Members of the&s;e Churches. And concerning all the&s;e I make no Scruple to a&s;&s;ert, that it is <HI>unlawful,</HI> or really &s;inful for them to &s;eparate from the Churches of which they are thus Members, and join in Com|munion with the <HI>Epi&s;copal Congregations</HI> in the Country. And the higher Profe&s;&s;ion any particular Per&s;on has made, or the more expre&s;s and particular his Engagements to our Churches have been, the more aggravated is his Sin in for|&s;aking them. The Rea&s;ons which convince me, and which I think ought to convince you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> of this, are &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P>I. The <HI>State of the mini&s;terial Office,</HI> in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and particularly the <HI>&s;inful Subjection</HI> of the Epi&s;co|pal Mini&s;ters in <HI>America,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prelates, renders it unlawful for us to go over to that Communion.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is a Matter of no &s;mall Con&s;equence to the <HI>chri&s;tian Church,</HI> that the mini&s;terial Office in it, be kept in the &s;ame State, and on the &s;ame Footing as Chri&s;t left it; and all Changes and Innovations in it mu&s;t be of dangerous Tenden|cy. He that has ju&s;t Sentiments of the Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s of God our Saviour, will &s;uppo&s;e that his In&s;titutions don't need our Amendments: And he that has a proper Sen&s;e
<PB N="80" REF="006158_0079_1027F96FAF5E9E10">of the entire Dependence of Go&s;pel Admini&s;trations on the Ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t, will think he acts the &s;afe&s;t Part, and is mo&s;t likely to obtain Succe&s;s, when he &s;trictly adheres to Chri&s;t's own Orders and Appointments.</P>
<P>I endeavour'd in my late <HI>Sermon,</HI> briefly to repre&s;ent the State of the Mini&s;try as de&s;cribed in the <HI>New-Te&s;tament,</HI> and to &s;hew the Oppo&s;ition between this and the State of it in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and among you at this Day. Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI> has undertaken your Defence, and taken a pretty deal of Pains to prove me mi&s;taken in my Notions of this Matter. There are <HI>three</HI> Things he objects again&s;t in this Affair, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Equality</HI> of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters,&mdash;My Account of the <HI>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</HI>&mdash;and my repre&s;enting the Prie&s;ts of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as <HI>preaching</HI> not by Virtue of their Ordination, but <HI>by Virtue of the Bi&s;hop's Licen&s;e.</HI> 'Tis there|fore my Bu&s;ine&s;s to defend what I have offered on the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Que&s;tion between us under this Head is, Whe|ther Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles in&s;tituted a proper and <HI>&s;tanding Prelacy</HI> in the Church; or appointed <HI>different Orders</HI> in the Mini&s;try, ve&s;ted with <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different Powers and Authori|ties, to be continued in the Go&s;pel Church? Now after all the Labour Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has been at to convince me of this, I can by no Means a&s;&s;ent to it, and that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">(1) It appears plain to me, that all Chri&s;t left in Commi&s;|&s;ion as Officers in the Go&s;pel Church, at the Time of his A&s;|cention into Heaven, were equal in Office and Power. The Di&s;putants on your Side u&s;e &s;ometimes to in&s;i&s;t, that the <HI>&s;e|venty</HI> Di&s;ciples were left in Commi&s;&s;ion by Chri&s;t as Officers in the Go&s;pel Church. And Mr. <HI>Wetmore,</HI> in &s;ome of his former Writings, appears to have been of this Opinion. But I find he is grown older and wi&s;er; for as I referred him to the <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> for a full a &s;olid Confutation of this, and he now makes no Mention of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> I look upon him as giving up the Argument drawn from them. There
<PB N="81" REF="006158_0080_1027F9713678AFD8">was therefore but ONE COMMISSION, that recorded <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 19, 20. left by Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel Church, when he a&s;cended into Heaven. And therefore there were only the <HI>eleven Apo&s;tles,</HI> to whom this Commi&s;&s;ion was immediately given, that could at that Time be looked upon as Officers in the Go&s;pel Church. And the&s;e were equal in every In|&s;tance of Office, Power or Authority. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> don't care to allow, that Equality of Power can be argued from the Identity of the Commi&s;&s;ion; and I have no Occa&s;ion to di&s;|pute this with him, &s;ince he grants all I now in&s;i&s;t on; <HI>viz.</HI> That it did in Fact make the <HI>eleven Apo&s;tles</HI> equal. His Words are the&s;e, (<HI>p.</HI> 13.) <Q>With Re&s;pect to the Apo&s;tles who were immediately authorized to gather and govern the Church by this Commi&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems to <HI>make them E|quals in that Power: Certainly it does not &s;ubject &s;ome unto any one their Number.</HI></Q> Now if Chri&s;t left only this Commi&s;&s;ion in his Church when he a&s;cended into Heaven, and this Commi&s;&s;ion was of &s;uch a Nature as to make all to whom it was immediately given, that is, all who then were Officers in the Church, equal in Power, and not &s;ome &s;ubject to others; it mu&s;t, I think, undeniably follow, that at this remarkable Period of Chri&s;t's A&s;cention, there was the mo&s;t exact Parity among Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, and no Subordination of one to another. And con&s;equently, Prelacy was not in&s;ti|tuted by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. I go on to a&s;&s;ert,</P>
<P N="2">(2). The Apo&s;tles did not in&s;titute any other &s;tanding Or|der in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, properly &s;o called, either &s;uperi|or or inferior, to tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t him&s;elf had thus left in Commi&s;&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> here attempts to prove, That the Apo&s;tles <HI>might,</HI> con&s;i&s;tently with the Commi&s;&s;ion they received from Chri&s;t, appoint a <HI>Di&s;parity</HI> in the Go&s;pel Mi|ni&s;try, and that <HI>in Fact</HI> they <HI>did &s;o.</HI> Let us examine his Rea&s;onings on the&s;e Points.</P>
<P>He will have it, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, that tho' Chri&s;t's Com|mi&s;&s;ion did not make an Inequality among the Apo&s;tles, yet it was large enough to authorize them to make one among
<PB N="82" REF="006158_0081_1027F9758F61B2C8">them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t, that it was no Way incon&s;i&s;tent with their Commi&s;&s;ion for them to do this. This he argues largely, <HI>p.</HI> 13, 14, 15. To all which I reply,</P>
<P>If by Power to make an Inequality among them&s;elves, he meant no more than that they might, for Order &s;ake, choo&s;e a Prolocutor, or Moderator, or (if he like the Term better) a Pre&s;ident, any Thing con&s;i&s;tent with his being only <HI>Pri|mus inter Pares,</HI> or the fir&s;t Man among Equals; I know no Body that di&s;putes it, and he knows we allow and practi&s;e it. But if he means a proper <HI>Difference of Order,</HI> if he would have this Pre&s;ident an Officer of an Order di&s;tinct from and &s;uperior to tho&s;e among whom he pre&s;ides, and ve&s;ted with Powers and Authorities e&s;&s;entially different from their's; which mu&s;t be his Meaning, if he would &s;ay anything to his Purpo&s;e, or lay any Foundation for the Prelacy e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> In this Ca&s;e I would enquire, Whether the&s;e Powers which thus dignify and di&s;tingui&s;h this Pre&s;ident, are contained in the <HI>original Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> given to the whole Number, or not. I &s;uppo&s;e it will be &s;aid that they are contained in it: Becau&s;e otherwi&s;e the Pre&s;ident will have his Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;eek, and it will be found that they who &s;et him up have pretended to give him an Authority which they them&s;elves never had. And if this dignified Pre|&s;ident has no Kind or Degree of Authority but what is con|tained in the Commi&s;&s;ion, how comes he by Powers which the Re&s;t have not; &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ion it &s;elf, which con|tains all his Powers was given equally to them all? There is but <HI>one Way</HI> in which this can be effected, and that is, by &s;uppo&s;ing each of the others to have <HI>le&s;s Authority</HI> than they had before the Pre&s;ident was cho&s;en; for if he can't have more Power than the Commi&s;&s;ion gives, they mu&s;t have le&s;s, or el&s;e they will &s;till remain in their <HI>primitive State of Equa|lity.</HI> But this latter Suppo&s;ition is as ab&s;urd as the former; for the Powers granted to any Per&s;on, or to any Number of Per&s;ons by Commi&s;&s;ion, are their's to u&s;e, and not go give a|way. And had the <HI>eleven</HI> Apo&s;tles acted in this Form, and &s;et up <HI>Peter,</HI> for In&s;tance, as their Pre&s;ident, with Powers e&s;|&s;entially
<PB N="83" REF="006158_0082_1027F979070E80D8">different from the Re&s;t; 'tis very plain that the o|ther <HI>ten</HI> had degraded them&s;elves from the Office in which Chri&s;t placed them, and con&s;equently had incapacitated them &s;elves for the Service he required and expected from them. And I hope Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> can &s;ee that this would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with their Duty to him.</P>
<P>Our Author goes on to con&s;ider the Matter <Q><HI>with Re&s;pect to other Officers or Mini&s;ters in the Church, to whom this Commi&s;&s;ion was not immediately given by Chri&s;t,</HI></Q> as he expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>p.</HI> 15. And he a&s;ks, <Q><HI>Can Equality among &s;uch with any Propriety be argued from this Commi&s;&s;ion</HI>?</Q> Now if by <Q><HI>Officers to whom this Commi&s;&s;ion was not immedi|diately given,</HI></Q> he intends only <HI>different Per&s;ons</HI> admitted into the <HI>&s;ame Office</HI> as <HI>Colleagues</HI> or <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> to the&s;e fir&s;t Officers (which by his U&s;e of the Word <HI>immediately</HI> here and in <HI>p.</HI> 13. &s;eems to be his Meaning) I an&s;wer, No Doubt Equality among &s;uch may, with the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t Propriety,</HI> be ar|gued from the Commi&s;&s;ion. It would be &s;trange indeed, if the Commi&s;&s;ion made tho&s;e to whom it was <HI>immediately given</HI> equal, as he owns it did, and tho&s;e to whom it was <HI>mediately given</HI> not equal. But perhaps by <HI>"other Officers or Mini&s;|ters of the Church",</HI> the Gentleman means Officers of a <HI>dif|ferent Order</HI> from tho&s;e to whom this Commi&s;&s;ion was imme|diately given; and if &s;o, it would have been exceeding pro|per for him to have proved that there were any &s;uch in the Apo&s;tles Days, before he enquired whether they were equal or unequal to one another. This he well knew I utterly de|nied, and therefore all his Di&s;cour&s;e of <Q><HI>every Order and Degree of Mini&s;try&mdash;how different &s;oever in Power&mdash;being</HI> virtuated <HI>by this Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI></Q> <HI>p.</HI> 15, 16. is merely <HI>beg|ging the Que&s;tion,</HI> for the very Thing in Debate is taken for granted and argued from.</P>
<P>Nothing is, or can be <HI>virtuated,</HI> by the Commi&s;&s;ion any Per&s;on acts under, but what that Commi&s;&s;ion authorizes him to act. And I believe Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is the fir&s;t Man that e|ver &s;uppo&s;ed a Commi&s;&s;ion authori&s;ed a Man to do every thing it does not expre&s;ly forbid; or, which amounts to the
<PB N="84" REF="006158_0083_1027F97D160B3FE0">&s;ame Thing, argued that a Man, acting by Virtue of a Com|mi&s;&s;ion, might do a certain Act becau&s;e <HI>"no Clau&s;e in the Commi&s;&s;ion would have been contravened thereby",</HI> or becau&s;e he could <HI>"&s;ee no Clau&s;e forbidding"</HI> it. <HI>p.</HI> 13. There is no Clau&s;e in the Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Peace,</HI> expre&s;ly forbidding him to try and execute a Man for High Trea&s;on, and yet it would be Murder in him to do it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> perhaps will think this In&s;tance not parallel, becau&s;e he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 13. <Q><HI>Much was left to their [the Apo&s;|tles] Wi&s;dom and Prudence,</HI> e&s;pecially under the Guidance of In&s;piration.</Q> The latter Clau&s;e in this Sentence, whatever might be intended by it, can I think &s;erve no other Purpo&s;e but to embarra&s;s the Matter, and mi&s;lead the inat|tentive Reader. For it plainly confounds two entirely di&s;|tinct Capacities, in which the Apo&s;tles acted; and which mu&s;t carefully be di&s;tingui&s;hed by all that would form clear Apprehen&s;ions of their Characters and of the Grounds on which they acted. 'Tis one Que&s;tion, What the Apo&s;tles might do, as per&s;ons acting under the ordinary and &s;tanding Commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t has given to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; and another, and a quite different Que&s;tion, what they might do, as Per&s;ons extraordinarily directed and in&s;pired by the Holy Spirit. In the former Capacity they could act nothing but what a Per&s;on ve&s;ted with the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, may at this Day act, at lea&s;t in like Circum&s;tances: But in the latter Capacity they might regularly do any Thing the Holy Spirit excited and directed them to.</P>
<P>This Di&s;tinction is very plain and obvious, and 'tis what Chri&s;t him&s;elf pointed out to his Apo&s;tles. For after he had given them the <HI>&s;tanding Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> which made them properly Officers in his Kingdom, and in which only they were to have Succe&s;&s;ors; he &s;aid to them, (Luke xxiv. 49.) <HI>And behold I &s;end the Promi&s;e of my Father upon you: But tarry ye in the City of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>until ye be endued with Power from on High.</HI> This <HI>Power from on High</HI> thus di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Power of Office</HI> which they already had by Virtue of their Commi&s;|&s;ion, evidently means the immediate In&s;piration and miracu|lous
<PB N="85" REF="006158_0084_1027F97E9D45C258">Influences of the Holy Gho&s;t. The Writers on this Controver&s;y commonly make this Di&s;tinction in the Terms of the <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers of the Apo&s;tles; meaning by the <HI>former</HI> what are contained in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o are common to all to whom the Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf be|longs; that is, to the Apo&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try: And by the <HI>latter,</HI> tho&s;e that aro&s;e from immediate In&s;piration, and &s;o were peculiar to the Apo&s;tles, or &s;uch wherein they had no Succe&s;&s;ors. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is too well acquainted with the Controver&s;y to be thought ig|norant of this Di&s;tinction &s;o commonly made, not could he be in&s;en&s;ible that in my <HI>Sermon</HI> I &s;teadily con&s;idered the A|po&s;tles in their <HI>ordinary Character,</HI> or as acting merely by virtue of that Commi&s;&s;ion, which Chri&s;t gave with an expre&s;s De&s;ign that it &s;hould remain in Force, and be executed to the End of the World.

<PB N="86" REF="006158_0085_1027F9805DDFCFD8">Mind, the Argument for Equality among Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, drawn from the Commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave them, remains in it's full Force, and is not in any Degree weakened by all Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has offered again&s;t it. His having Recour&s;e in this Ca&s;e to what the Apo&s;tles might do, <HI>"under the Guidance of In&s;piration",</HI> is a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion, that they could not erect the Prelacy he pleads for, <HI>merely by Virtue of their Commi&s;&s;ion;</HI> and the Rea&s;on of this mu&s;t be, becau&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion did not give them Authority to do it. Thus far then I think we may go on &s;ure Ground, There was at fir&s;t a <HI>perfect Parity</HI> or Equality among Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters; and no one of them was of an higher Order, or ve&s;ted with greater Authority than the Re&s;t. For Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> allows, that the Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf <HI>"&s;eems to make them Equals";</HI> and I have proved that it did not give them Authority to introduce an Inequality of Order among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We are <HI>next</HI> to enquire, Whether the Apo&s;tles, <HI>under the In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> did in Fact in&s;titute any other or different Order in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, properly &s;o called. For tho' they could not do this, con&s;idered as <HI>acting under the Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> we have been di&s;puting about, becau&s;e that gave them no Authority to do it, and con&s;equently of they had done it, we mu&s;t not &s;ay that the Order of Mini&s;ty thus in|&s;tituted was <HI>virtuated by this Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> but by <HI>their extraor|dinary Authority as in&s;pired Per&s;ons;</HI> yet if they did it under the Influence and Direction of Holy Spirit, we are doubtle&s;s obliged to ob&s;erve &s;uch their Appointment. I argued in my <HI>Ser|mon</HI> again&s;t their having done this, from the Silence of the &s;a|cred Writers on this Head, in this Manner, <Q><HI>We never read in the New-Te&s;tament of any other</HI> Orders <HI>being erec|ted in the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try; and doubtl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> we &s;hould have had a particular and plain Account of it, if any other had been af|terwards appointed; and not have been left to collect it from &s;ome</HI> few &s;cattered Sentences <HI>and</HI> ob&s;cure Hints <HI>of doubtful Interpretation.</HI></Q> And I illu&s;trated the Remark, by ob|&s;erving, how very <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>circum&s;tantial</HI> an Account the in&s;pired Hi&s;torian has given us of the Appointment of

Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> I hope don't take their Writings for Part of the New-Te&s;tament. Again, if the whole Di&s;pute may be <HI>ea&s;ily decided,</HI> and that from <HI>very plain Records,</HI> I hope we &s;hall have no Occa&s;ion to debate &s;uch Texts as are con|fe&s;&s;edly <HI>Ob&s;cure,</HI> and which, after all the learned Labour which has been expended upon them, remain <HI>doubtful</HI> and of <HI>uncertain Interpretation.</HI> And as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is on the af|firmative Side, it plainly belongs to him to produce the&s;e <HI>very plain</HI> Records of the New-Te&s;tament, which will &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> decide this whole Debate.</P>
<P>He begins thus, <HI>p.</HI> 16 <Q><HI>That the Deacons were an Order inferior, not only to the Apo&s;tles, but to other Mini&s;ters then in the Church, Mr.</HI> Hobart <HI>allows.</HI></Q> There is &s;omething in this Sentence I can't account for. By <HI>"other Mini&s;ters then in the Church",</HI> he mu&s;t mean, <HI>Mini&s;ters of an Order in|ferior to the Apo&s;tles,</HI> otherwi&s;e I can't make Sen&s;e of what he &s;ays. And yet he knows that if the Apo&s;tles are con&s;ide|red in their ordinary Capacity, I deny that there was any Order in the Mini&s;try inferior to them; and he even repre|&s;ents me as making all other Mini&s;ters equal to them in all Re&s;pects. And there is not a Word in the Page of my <HI>Sermon</HI> he quotes to ju&s;tify him in this. I there &s;ay, that the Deacons <HI>"are an Order inferior to the Ministry, properly &s;o called",</HI> and by <HI>the Mini&s;try properly &s;o called,</HI> I mean the Office Chri&s;t in&s;tituted when he &s;aid, <HI>Go ye there|fore teach all Nations, baptizing them,</HI> &amp;c. which Office I al|ways &s;uppo&s;e common to the Apo&s;tles and all other Mini&s;|ters of the Go&s;pel. But this is not the only Time Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="006158_0087_1027F984E8B98598">has quoted that from my Sermon which was never in it; his very fir&s;t Quotation, <HI>p.</HI> 7. is a flagrant In&s;tance of this Kind. Had I taken &s;uch Liberties in quoting from him, or any other Author, I make no Doubt he would have replied, <HI>"I boldly charge him with gro&s;s Prevarication and Fal&s;hood, done with a wicked Intent".</HI> But &s;ince Recriminations, how|ever ju&s;t, do nothing toward determining the Controver&s;y, I chu&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>I can by no Means allow that the Apo&s;tles appointing the Of|fice of Deacons, proves their in&s;tituting different Orders in the Mini&s;try <HI>properly &s;o called;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Deacons</HI> are not, properly &s;peaking, an Order <HI>in</HI> the Mini&s;try, but (as I &s;aid before) an Order <HI>inferior to it.</HI> Their Office is not &s;o much as <HI>"vir|tuated"</HI> by the only Commi&s;&s;ion, given to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;|try; for the Apo&s;tles in appointing this Office did not act by <HI>virtue of this Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> but as Per&s;ons under the immediate Direction of the Holy Spirit. The <HI>Serving of Tables,</HI> which was the only Thing Deacons were originally appointed for, was no Part of the Office of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, nor is there a Word relating to it in his Commi&s;&s;ion. Nay the Scripture oppo&s;es the Office to which <HI>Deacons</HI> were appointed, to the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the Word, Acts vi. 2, 3, 4. <HI>Then the Twelve called the Multitude of the Di&s;ciples unto them, and &s;aid, it is not Rea&s;on that we &s;hould</HI> leave the Word of God, <HI>and</HI> &s;erve Tables. <HI>Wherefore, Brethren, look ye out among you &s;even Man &mdash;whom we may appoint over</HI> this Bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>But we will give our&s;elves continually to Prayer and to</HI> the Mini&s;try of the Word. Here the <HI>Word of God</HI> is oppo&s;ed to <HI>the Service of Tables,</HI> and <HI>this Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> that is, the <HI>Serving of Tables</HI> is oppo&s;ed to the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Word.</HI> The proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of Deacons, and the only De&s;ign of their In&s;titution, is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>&s;er|ving Tables,</HI> and the peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Apo&s;tles is called the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Word.</HI> And if Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> remembers that <HI>teaching</HI> or preaching the Go&s;pel is the fri&s;t and great Thing mentioned in the Commi&s;&s;ion he and I &s;o often refer to, I hope he will allow that the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Word</HI> men|tioned here, is the Mini&s;try properly &s;o called, and what the
<PB N="89" REF="006158_0088_1027F98A25258198">Deacons as &s;uch were not appointed to. Notwith&s;tanding therefore the In&s;tances he has produced (&s;ome of which will not bear examining) of Per&s;ons preaching and baptizing, who had <HI>formerly been</HI> Deacons, but now were Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; he mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if in&s;tead of admitting this as a Proof of Inequality in the Mini&s;try, I look upon the <HI>preaching Deacon</HI> in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as a mere <HI>Lay-Exhortor.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> mentions <Q><HI>two Texts in the Writings of St.</HI> Paul, <HI>to put the Matter out of all Doubt, that in the fir&s;t Planting of Chri&s;tianity, God him&s;elf e&s;ta|bli&s;hed</HI> Imparity <HI>among the Mini&s;ters whom he &s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel of his Son.</HI></Q> <HI>p.</HI> 18. The two Texts are, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 28, 29. and <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 11. The latter of the&s;e Texts &s;ays not a Word about <HI>Parity</HI> or <HI>Imparity,</HI> which is the only Thing now under Con&s;ideration; and therefore I &s;hall only &s;ay of it as he does, <HI>"I will leave this without a Comment".</HI> And the former Text does rather expre&s;s a <HI>Di|ver&s;ity</HI> than an <HI>Inequality</HI> between the Per&s;ons it refers to; and the Que&s;tions is, who the&s;e Per&s;ons are. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Are all Apo&s;tles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers?</HI> &amp;c. I enquire, <HI>All who?</HI> Does he mean all Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, or all Members of the Chri&s;tian Church? Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>all Mini&s;ters:</HI> But this I can't believe, becau&s;e he denies their being <HI>Teachers,</HI> as &s;trongly as he does their being <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and I apprehend that an <HI>unpreaching Mi|ni&s;try,</HI> tho' allow'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> did not obtain in the Apo&s;tles Time. And as the Apo&s;tle is, in the Context, drawing a Compari&s;on between the Church of Chri&s;t, and a natural Body, con&s;i&s;ting of many Members, de&s;igned for and &s;uited to different U&s;es and Services, all of them nece&s;&s;ary to the Good of the whole Body; it &s;eems mo&s;t agreable to his De&s;ign, to under&s;tand him, as I do, as &s;peaking of the <HI>Mem|bers of the Church</HI> in general, and not of the <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel</HI> in particular. And thus This Text proves no Sort of <HI>Inequality</HI> among Go&s;pel <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="006158_0089_1027F98BAF4CC3C0">
I find nothing more in Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s <HI>Vindication,</HI> to prove a <HI>Di&s;parity</HI> among Mini&s;ters, that requires any An&s;wer, un|le&s;s perhaps what he &s;ays <HI>p.</HI> 9. about the Word <HI>Synergoi</HI> or <HI>Fellow-Labourers.</HI> This I u&s;ed in my <HI>Sermon,</HI> rather as an Introduction to the Argument, than as a Part of it. But &s;ince he has been plea&s;ed to make &s;ome Remarks upon it, and, with his u&s;ual <HI>Accuracy</HI> and <HI>Condour,</HI> has carried the Mat|ter &s;o far as to make the Argument imply Bla&s;phemy, or a making Men equal with God; I think my&s;elf obliged to make &s;ome Reply. And &s;hall therefore &s;ay, The In&s;tances he gives of the U&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words <HI>Fellow-Men, Fel|low-Chri&s;tians, &amp;c.</HI> make nothing again&s;t me, for the greate&s;t <HI>Prince</HI> and the meane&s;t <HI>Beggar,</HI> con&s;idered merely <HI>as Men,</HI> or <HI>as Chri&s;tians,</HI> are equal. But what I am principally con|cerned in is the U&s;e of the <HI>Greek</HI> Word <HI>Synergoi</HI> in that Text 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 9. which is the only In&s;tance Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> pre|tends to, in which this Word can't be taken in the Sen&s;e of Equality. The Words in the <HI>Original</HI> &s;tand thus, <HI>Theou gar e&s;men Synergoi,</HI> the mo&s;t literal Tran&s;lation of which is, <HI>For we are God's Fellow Labourers;</HI> for the genitive Ca&s;e <HI>Theou</HI> ought not to be rendred, as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> tran&s;lates it, <HI>with</HI> God; but <HI>God's,</HI> or <HI>of God.</HI> Should I &s;ay of my&s;elf and my Brethren in the Mini&s;try, we are <HI>Theou Syndouloi, God's Fel|low-Servants;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> <Q><HI>would have tho't the Man very weak in his Intelectuals, who &s;hould have char|ged m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Bla&s;phemy, for making my&s;elf equal with God.</HI></Q> And indeed <HI>this Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in&s;tead of repre&s;enting God as one of the <HI>Fellow-Servants,</HI> really repre&s;ents him as the <HI>com|mon Lord</HI> and Ma&s;ter of them all. And thus when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Apollos</HI> are &s;tiled <HI>God's Fellow-Labourers,</HI> the <HI>Equality</HI> &s;ug|ge&s;ted in the Expre&s;&s;ion is <HI>wholly</HI> and <HI>only</HI> between <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Apollos;</HI> and not at all between the ble&s;&s;ed God and either of them, which would be Bla&s;phemy indeed. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Apollos</HI> are <HI>Fellow-Labourers,</HI> the Relation between them is that of <HI>Equality:</HI> But God is their great LORD, their Owner and Employer. And all this the <HI>original</HI> Words plainly &s;ugge&s;t. The Word <HI>Theou</HI> is three Times u&s;ed in that one Ver&s;e, and
<PB N="91" REF="006158_0090_1027F98D77594408">is every Time what <HI>Grammarians</HI> call the <HI>genitive Ca&s;e po&s;itive,</HI> and denotes God's &s;overeign and ab&s;olute Property in the Thing &s;poken of.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e my &s;elf to have fully an&s;wered all Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has &s;aid to prove an Inequality in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and therefore to have now a Right to conclude, that neither our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor his Apo&s;tles, appointed different Orders in the &s;tanding Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel; and con&s;equently that the <HI>Prelacy</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church of <HI>England</HI> is repugnant to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, and renders the mini&s;terial Character and Offices quite a different Thing from what it was in the Days of the Apo&s;tles. And if there be but one Order in the Mini&s;try, Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> will, I &s;uppo&s;e, allow, that the <HI>Pow|er of Ordination</HI> belongs to that Order; for I have no Su&s;pi|cion that he will turn Advocate for the Power of the <HI>Laity</HI> in that Ca&s;e. And therefore I think it wholly needle&s;s now to di&s;pute which Order has the Power of Ordination.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be con&s;idered is the <HI>Oath of canonical Obedience,</HI> by which the Prie&s;ts of the Church of <HI>England</HI> o|blige them&s;elves to obey their Bi&s;hops <HI>in all Things lawful and hone&s;t.</HI> This I repre&s;ented as <HI>calling the Bi&s;hop Ma&s;ter,</HI> con|trary to the Command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiii. 8, 9, 10. and argued upon it thus, <Q><HI>The taking an</HI> Oath of Allegiance <HI>to a Prince, is the highe&s;t Acknowledgment of his Sovereignty, the mo&s;t &s;olemn Profe&s;&s;ion of Subjection to him; or, in Chri&s;t's Language,</HI> 'tis calling him Ma&s;ter, <HI>and this, altho' no Per|&s;on is obliged by his Alligiance to obey his Prince in any Thing but what is</HI> lawful and hone&s;t. <HI>Now who can give a Rea|&s;on why taking the Oath of Allegiance to a Prince, &s;hould be e&s;teemed calling him Ma&s;ter in a</HI> civil <HI>Sen&s;e, and yet taking an Oath of canonical Obedience to a Bi&s;hop not be look'd upon as calling him Ma&s;ter in an</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>or</HI> religious <HI>Sen&s;e? Or who will pretend that being called Ma&s;ter in a</HI> religious Sen&s;e, <HI>is not expre&s;ly forbidden to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters by their great</HI> MASTER?</Q> Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>-don't deny your Mini&s;ter's taking &s;uch an Oath as I have mentioned; and he &s;eems ra|ther
<PB N="92" REF="006158_0091_1027F9936DD2C238">di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>quarrel</HI> at the Argument than to an&s;wer it. He enquires, <HI>Who authorized me to be &s;o dogmatical in putting my Con&s;truction upon tho&s;e Words of our Saviour?</HI> I an&s;wer, the Text it&s;elf. He further &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 25. <Q><HI>A Rebuke for his In&s;olence is the propere&s;t An&s;wer to be given him.</HI></Q> This Way of arguing is &s;ometimes admitted among <HI>Parters,</HI> who, when they can't otherwi&s;e an&s;wer their Antagoni&s;t, tell him, <HI>he de&s;erves to have his Head broke for his Impudence;</HI> but it ought never to be admitted into the Di&s;putes of <HI>Gentlemen</HI> or <HI>Schollars,</HI> much le&s;s into tho&s;e of <HI>Divines;</HI> and I can't but think Mr. <HI>Wetmore,</HI> on cool Reflection, will be a&s;ham'd of his having u&s;ed it.</P>
<P>He goes on to &s;ay, <Q><HI>If there be any Power and Authority in any Order what&s;oever in the Church, to which Men ought to be &s;ubject and pay Obedience, it can be no Fault to own that Authority, and promi&s;e and engage mo&s;t &s;olemnly and faithfully to be &s;ubject to it.</HI></Q> I am glad to meet with anything un|der this Head, that has &s;o much Appearance of Argument; and feel a Di&s;po&s;ition in my own Mind to treat it with Tenderne&s;s, on that Account. But however, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> undertook the Province of replying to my <HI>Sermon,</HI> he ought to have an&s;wered my Arguments, which he here has not &s;o much as attempted. He does not deny that taking the Oath of Allegiance to a Prince is an Acknowledgment of his Sovereignty, or <HI>calling him Ma&s;ter;</HI> he does not pretend that the&s;e two Ca&s;es are not parallel, nor dare he &s;ay, that <HI>calling a Man Ma&s;ter</HI> in the <HI>religious</HI> Sen&s;e, is not directly contrary to Chri&s;t's expre&s;s Inhibition to his Di&s;ciples. 'Tis &s;trange that a Man &s;hould not have a Word to &s;ay again&s;t either of the&s;e Things, and yet &s;hould pretend to ju&s;tify this Practice.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that where any Kind of Obedience is due, the Per|formance of it may properly be &s;ecured by the Solemnity of an Oath, is (1) Nothing to the Purpo&s;e; for I have proved that all Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are, by divine In&s;titution, e|qual; and therefore no one of them owes Obedience to ano|ther. It is (2) contrary to the Sen&s;e of Mankind. There
<PB N="93" REF="006158_0092_1027F99646006080">are a Variety of Ca&s;es in which one Per&s;on is obliged to obey the lawful Commands of another; wherein yet no Man ever tho't it proper or rea&s;onable to oblige him&s;elf by the So|lemnity of an Oath, For In&s;tance, the <HI>Con&s;table</HI> of <HI>Rye</HI> has a lawful Authority in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to command Mr. <HI>Wetmore,</HI> and he is obliged by the Laws of his Country to obey him: Yet &s;hould the Con&s;table require him to take a &s;olemn Oath to obey his lawful Commands, I fancy Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> would think, <HI>"a Rebuke for his In&s;olence the pro|pere&s;t An&s;wer to be given him"?</HI></P>
<P>I called this Submi&s;&s;ion of Pre&s;byters to Bi&s;hops in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> a <HI>&s;ervile</HI> one. And tho' I take no Plea&s;ure in the U&s;e of <HI>har&s;h Epithets,</HI> I yet think it ought to be &s;o &s;tiled. No <HI>Servant</HI> is, or can be under a <HI>&s;tronger</HI> or more &s;olemn Obligation to his <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> than what ari&s;es from his <HI>having Sworn</HI> to obey him: No Obligation to Obedience can po&s;&s;ibly be more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> than that which reaches to <HI>all</HI> Things lawful and hone&s;t; nor can any Servitude be more <HI>du|rable</HI> than to be obliged to obey a Man and his Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing to be debated under this Head, is <HI>the Pre&s;|byters Preaching by Virtue of the Bi&s;hop's Licence,</HI> and not merely by Virtue of Chri&s;t's Commi&s;&s;ion, which he is ve&s;ted with in Ordination.

<P N="2">2. The <HI>having a Licence</HI> is what gives the former Sort of Mini&s;ters a Right or <HI>legal Authority</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel; and the <HI>not being licen&s;ed</HI> is the Rea&s;on why the latter <HI>may not preach.</HI> Thus the Matter is expre&s;s'd in the <HI>Canons</HI> already cited; <HI>If he be allowed to be a Preacher, he &s;hall preach, and if he be not allowed to be a Preacher, he &s;hall procure Sermons to be preached by &s;uch as are lawfully licen&s;ed Preachers;</HI> and <HI>if he be not licen&s;ed for a Preacher, he &s;hall not expound in his own Cure</HI> or Pari&s;h, but <HI>only read the Homilies,</HI> ju&s;t as they are printed.

And &s;hould Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> be pro&s;ecuted in a &s;piritual Court for preaching, the be&s;t Certificate of his having been epi&s;copally or|dained would &s;ignify Nothing towards ju&s;tifying him, if he could not produce a <HI>Licence for Preaching.</HI> If there be anything further nece&s;&s;ary to prove that it is <HI>the Licence,</HI> and not <HI>Ordi|nation,</HI> the gives the proper <HI>legal</HI> Authority to preach as Mi|ni&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> I would refer you to CA|NON 54. the Title of which is, <Q><HI>The Licences of Preachers refu&s;ing Conformity to be void;</HI></Q> and which concludes in the&s;e Terms, <Q><HI>We determine and decree, that the Licence of every &s;uch Preacher &s;hall thereupon be utterly void and of none Effect.</HI></Q> And will only a&s;k Mr. <HI>Wetmore,</HI> Whether a

<P N="3">3. The Rea&s;on why &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are not licenced to preach, is, <HI>becau&s;e they have not the proper Qualifications of Preachers,</HI> or Ability to preach. If the Church licences &s;ome Mini&s;ters for Preachers, and re|quires them to preach; and refu&s;es a Licence to others, and requires them to confine them&s;elves to the bare reading of the printed Homilies; it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he does this becau&s;e &s;he is &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome of her Min&s;ters are not fit to be allowed Preaches. And the <HI>Convocation</HI> &s;ay plainly e|nough that this was the Rea&s;on they acted upon, CAN. 57. <Q>Whereas divers Per&s;ons&mdash;do refu&s;e to have their Children baptized by <HI>a Mini&s;ter that is no Preacher,</HI> and to receive the holy Communion at his Hands&mdash; <HI>as tho' the Virtue of tho&s;e Sacraments did depend on his</HI> ABILITY TO PREACH &mdash;We require and charge every &s;uch Per&s;on&mdash;to reform, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;both the &s;aid Sacraments being equally effectual, whether mini&s;tred by <HI>a Mini&s;ter that is no Preacher,</HI> or by <HI>one that is a Preacher.</HI></Q> The <HI>Canon</HI> finds no Fault with the&s;e Per&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e <HI>unpreaching Mini&s;ters</HI> were really de&s;titute of Ability to preach, but only for thinking their Want of this Ability rendred the Sacraments they ad|mini&s;tred ineffectual; and accordingly refu&s;ing to receive them; which is in Effect allowing that the&s;e Mini&s;ters <HI>really had not Ability to preach,</HI> and that <HI>on this Account</HI> they were not licen&s;ed to it. Now from hence it follows,</P>
<P N="4">4. That an <HI>Ability to teach</HI> or preach the Go&s;pel is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Ordination in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> If the Church allows an <HI>upreaching Mini&s;try;</HI> if &s;he de&s;igns Men &s;hould be admitted into the Mini&s;try, and allowed as Mini&s;|ters to read Prayers and Homilies, and admini&s;ter Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, but not be permitted to preach, and that becau&s;e they have not Ability to preach; it would be
<PB N="97" REF="006158_0096_1027F9A226A829F8">a &s;trange Contradiction indeed, if after all, an Ability to preach were required as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification, in all that are admitted into the Mini&s;try by Ordination. To what Purpo&s;e &s;hould an <HI>Ability to teach</HI> be in&s;i&s;ted upon, or enqui|red after, in a Man that is not de&s;igned to the a Preacher, but only an <HI>Homily-Reader?</HI> Or rather, if none were ordain|ed but &s;uch as were capable of Preaching, why &s;hould not all ordained Mini&s;ters be allowed to preach without any &s;ub&s;e|quent Licence? Either therefore the Church of <HI>England</HI> e|gregiou&s;ly contradicts her&s;elf, or el&s;e Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> mi&s;takes her Sen&s;e, when he repre&s;ents the Book of Ordination and the 34th <HI>Canon</HI> as contradicting what I had a&s;&s;erted. The <HI>Ca|non</HI> he quotes, does as he &s;ays, require that the Per&s;on to be ordained <Q><HI>be able to yield an Account of his Faith in</HI> Latin, <HI>according to the Articles&mdash;and to confirm the &s;ame by &s;uffici|ent Te&s;timonies out of the Holy Scriptures.</HI></Q> And this, rightly under&s;tood, does not contradict what I before &s;aid from Mr. <HI>Pierce.</HI> To <HI>give an Account of their Faith according to the Articles,</HI> means no more than <HI>to repeat the Articles,</HI> with a Profe&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;enting to them. The 61&s;t <HI>Canon</HI> requires Mini&s;ters to take e&s;pecial Care that no Children be pre&s;ented to the Bi&s;hop for <HI>Confirmation,</HI> <Q>but &s;uch as can <HI>render an Account of their Faith according to the Catechi&s;m.</HI></Q> Now 'tis evident, from the <HI>Office for Confirmation,</HI> that this means no more than an <HI>Ability to repeat the Catechi&s;m,</HI> or an&s;wer the Que&s;tions in it. The Per&s;on to be ordained mu&s;t be able to yield this Account of his Faith <HI>in Latin;</HI> that is, he mu&s;t be able to tran&s;late the Articles into that Language, which every one can do who <HI>under&s;tands Latin.</HI> The <HI>Canon</HI> further re|quires, that he be able to <HI>confirm the &s;ame, by &s;ufficient Te&s;ti|monies out of the holy Scriptures.</HI> Had this Expre&s;&s;ion been u&s;ed likewi&s;e of the Child to be confirmed, every Body would have under&s;tood it as intending the &s;ame Thing as we com|monly expre&s;s by a Child's having learnt his <HI>Proof-Catechi&s;m.</HI> And as the Words in the 34th <HI>Canon</HI> are capable of this Sea&s;e &s;o they ought to be taken in it; for they are no other Way reconcilable to the other Canons. It may be proper enough
<PB N="98" REF="006158_0097_1027F9A3D5682210">to require that the Per&s;on to be ordained, tho' he is not de|&s;igned to be a Preacher, &s;hould be able to name &s;uch Texts of Scripture as are generally tho't to prove &s;uch and &s;uch Articles of the Church; and this he may ea&s;ily attain to, &s;ince there are Editions of the Articles with &s;uch Scriptures annexed. But to require proper <HI>Skill in Divinity,</HI> or an A|bility to explain and defend the Articles of the chri&s;tian Faith, as nece&s;&s;ary to the Ordination of a Man, who after he is or|dained is not to be allowed, even in his own Cure, to expound any Scripture or Matter of Doctrine, but only to read the Homilies, without glo&s;&s;ing or adding; would be extremely ab&s;urd. I can't find therefore that the <HI>Canons</HI> require any thing more in Point of <HI>Learning</HI> or <HI>Scholar&s;hip,</HI> in the Per&s;on to be ordained, than that the <HI>under&s;tand Latin,</HI> which is what Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> is &s;o angry with Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> for &s;aying, and with me for repeating from him.</P>
<P>It is Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not mine, to reconcile the Forms u&s;ed in Ordination to the&s;e <HI>Canons.</HI> If they con|tradict one another, I can't help it; and I am not, on that Account, to be charged with Fal&s;hood; for I never &s;aid they were not contradictory. I allow that the Bi&s;hop in ordain|ing a Pre&s;byter, u&s;es &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as are &s;ufficiently de|&s;criptive of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, the Office which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted in his Church; and in which, I have before proved, there is but one Order. This <HI>"high Dignity",</HI> this <HI>"weighty Office and Charge"</HI> into which the Per&s;on is called, is the very &s;ame in which the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf &s;tands, and the Per&s;on thus ordained, is, by Chri&s;t's In&s;titu|tion, equal to him that ordained him. But now I can't t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">k it con&s;i&s;tent with his Duty to Chri&s;t or his Church, or with his own &s;olemn Vows and Engagements, the Charge he has received, or the Account he mu&s;t give at la&s;t, for the Per&s;on thus ordained, to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Bi&s;hop, &s;o far as to take an Oath of canonical Obedience to him, and a Li|cence to preach the Go&s;pel from him, making him&s;elf thus entirely dependent on him, and rather the <HI>Bi&s;hop's Servant</HI> than <HI>Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ter.</HI> 'Tis really &s;urprizing to me, to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="99" REF="006158_0098_1027F9A7325F8DB8">to what a prodigious Degree the <HI>Imparity</HI> between Mini&s;ters is carried in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Pre&s;byters, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>lofty Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> u&s;ed in ordaining them, are con&s;idered but as a Kind of <HI>Deputies</HI> or <HI>Journeymen</HI> to the Bi&s;hops. In the Morning Prayer to be &s;aid daily throughout the Year, you pray for the Clergy under the Name of <HI>Bi&s;hops and Curates,</HI> and the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions you u&s;e in the Even|ing Prayer, and &s;o in the Prayer for the whole State of Chri&s;t's Church militant on Earth, in the Communion Office.

<P>This Subjection of &s;ome Mini&s;ters to others, evidently ap|pears to me <HI>Servile</HI> in it's Nature, and directly contrary to an expre&s;s Command of Chri&s;t. And I cannot &s;ee how tho&s;e who thus degrade them&s;elves from the Office in which Chri&s;t has placed them, and incapacitate them&s;elves for the Services he requires of them, can expect his Ble&s;&s;ing on their Labours at pre&s;ent, or to give a good Account to him at la&s;t, of the Powers he gave them, and they, by a &s;inful Submi&s;&s;ion to o|thers, rendred them&s;elves incapable of exerci&s;ing. This I think proves the <HI>Unlawfulne&s;s</HI> to for&s;aking our Churches and joining in that Communion; for it is (with Regard to this Country) to embrace a Communion in which the Mini&s;ters have, or at lea&s;t can exerci&s;e but one half the Powers, Chri&s;t has given his Mini&s;ters, and arrive at the Right of exerci&s;ing that Half by &s;uch a mean and &s;ervile Submi&s;&s;ion to others as Chri&s;t has plainly forbid.</P>
<P>Thus I have fini&s;hed this Part of the Controver&s;y, without being at all convinced by Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI>'s Arguments, or inti|midated by the Expre&s;&s;ions of his angry Re&s;entments; and I hope, without being ruffled by his abu&s;ive Treatment. And

<P>I have already con&s;idered how <HI>arbitrary</HI> and <HI>tyrannical</HI> the Di&s;cipline he pleads for is; and am now to &s;hew, that you
<PB N="103" REF="006158_0102_1027F9B30F440908">cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> exerci&s;e any Di&s;cipline at all in your A&s;&s;emblies. The Advocates for the Church of <HI>England</HI> commonly make Ordination and Government peculiar to Bi&s;hops; and accor|dingly I find the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> in his <HI>Sermon before the So|ciety, p.</HI> 32. thus reckoning up the Advantages that would follow upon &s;ending Bi&s;hops into <HI>America,</HI> <Q><HI>Had they Bi|&s;hops there, Per&s;ons might be</HI> ordained <HI>without the Inconveni|encies of a long Voyage.&mdash;The primitive and mo&s;t u&s;eful Ap|pointment of</HI> Confirmation <HI>might be re&s;tored; and an</HI> order|ly Di&s;cipline <HI>exerci&s;ed in the Churches.</HI></Q> His Lord&s;hip, it &s;eems, thinks you as really de&s;titute of an <HI>orderly Di&s;cipline,</HI> as you are of <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>Ordination</HI> in your Churches; and that there is no Way to remedy this, but by &s;ending o|ver Bi&s;hops. Tho' for my Part, I can't &s;ee that the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf has, according to the Practice of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> anything to do with the Di&s;cipline of the Church; this is managed in the &s;piritual Court, by a <HI>Lay-Chancellor,</HI> ap|pointed indeed by the Bi&s;hop, and acting in his Name, but not under his Direction, nor liable to be controled by him. The Pre&s;byters, in&s;tead of having any proper Power of Di&s;|ciplines, are by Law obliged to receive and publi&s;h the Cen|&s;ures pronounced by this <HI>Lay-Chancellor.</HI> And when the old Puritan Mini&s;ters in the Church attempted to exerci&s;e Di&s;ci|pline upon their &s;candalous Pari&s;hioners, they were &s;everely puni&s;hed for it, by the &s;piritual Courts. This was the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> mentioned in my <HI>Sermon.</HI></P>
<P>In Oppo&s;ition to this, Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> tells of a Commi&s;&s;ion to be found in the <HI>Form for ordaining</HI> Prie&s;ts, authorizing them to exerci&s;e Di&s;cipline. And if this were Fact, the Con&s;equence would be, that the Church gives them Authori|ty and forbids them to exerci&s;e it, nay, and puni&s;hes them if they pre&s;ume to u&s;e it, in the Ca&s;e of Di&s;cipline as well as in that of Preaching. And why &s;hould Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> be &s;o very fond of taking all Opportunities of repre&s;enting the Church of <HI>England</HI> as acting &s;o ab&s;urd and ridiculous a Part as this? I find <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> but once mentioned in the Pa&s;&s;ages
<PB N="104" REF="006158_0103_1027F9B4D0533AD0">he has given us from the Form of Ordination; and then the Exerci&s;e of it is re&s;trained by the&s;e Words, <HI>"as this Church and Realm hath received the &s;ame":</HI> Now for a Prie&s;t to ex|erci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline, as the Church and Realm of <HI>England</HI> has received-it, as to publi&s;h and execute the Con|&s;ures or the &s;piritual Court; or at mo&s;t, it can mean no more than that he &s;u&s;pend a &s;candalous Per&s;on for <HI>fourteen Days,</HI> and certify the Cau&s;e into the &s;piritual Court within that Term; for neither the Canons nor Rubricks allow him to proceed farther than this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays that the Prie&s;t in this Country can't be obliged to notify the Ordinary in fourteen Days, becau&s;e it is impracticable, <HI>p.</HI> 28. And thus far he is undoubtedly in the Right, for no Man is obliged to Impo&s;&s;ibilities. But he is greatly mi&s;taken if he thinks he may therefore &s;u&s;pend for a <HI>longer Term,</HI> or &s;u&s;pend and <HI>not notify</HI> the Ordinary; nay, or that he may refu&s;e to admit a Per&s;on to the Communion when the Ca&s;e is &s;uch that he cannot certify the Ordinary within that Term. The Rubrick to the Communion Office, after giving the Mini&s;ter Authority to refu&s;e the Sacrament to Per&s;ons in the Ca&s;es there named, adds the&s;e Words, <Q><HI>Provided that every Mini&s;ter &s;o repelling any&mdash;&s;hall be obli|ged to give an Account of the &s;ame to the Ordinary, within fourteen Days after at the farthe&s;t. And the Ordinary &s;hall proceed again&s;t the offending Party according to the Canons.</HI></Q> The <HI>Rubrick</HI> does not de&s;ign the Mini&s;ter &s;hall inflict any <HI>proper Cen&s;ure</HI> upon the Per&s;on; <HI>this</HI> is re&s;erved to the <HI>Ordi|nary,</HI> and in Order to it, the Man mu&s;t have a <HI>legal Tryal;</HI> the Judge mu&s;t proceed again&s;t him <HI>according to the Canon.</HI> The Mini&s;ter is only to <HI>prepare the Way</HI> to this, by &s;u&s;pen|ding the Per&s;on, and informing the Ordinary. And that the Prie&s;t may not abu&s;e this Power to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Lai|ty, he &s;hall always be obliged to inform the Ordinary in four|teen Days <HI>at farthe&s;t.</HI> But now an <HI>unlimited Su&s;pen&s;ion</HI> is a <HI>proper Cen&s;ure,</HI> and differs very littie, or rather nothing at all, from the <HI>le&s;&s;er Excommunication;</HI> which is not to be inflicted without a legal Trial, nor by any Per&s;on but the Judge in
<PB N="105" REF="006158_0104_1027F9BA54A64140">the &s;piritual Court. Now how ab&s;urd is it for Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> to argue, that becau&s;e <Q><HI>the limited Time</HI> is <HI>impracticable to to be complied with, and the De&s;ign of referring the Cau&s;e to the Hearing of the Judges appointed not taking Place,&mdash;&s;uch Affairs are left with the Mini&s;ter to determine according to his be&s;t Prudence,</HI></Q> <HI>p.</HI> 28. when the Rubrick gives him <HI>no Authority</HI> to <HI>try</HI> or <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> the Per&s;on? This is ju&s;t as if a Man &s;hould argue, that becau&s;e a <HI>Ju&s;tice of Peace</HI> may impri|&s;on a Murderer in order to his having a legal Trial, therefore he may him&s;elf try and execute him.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, is Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> really &s;o ignorant of the Na|ture and De&s;ign of PROVISOS, annexed to Laws, as not to know that if the Law cannot be executed and the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> ob|&s;erved, it can't be executed at all? If a Law were made for inflicting a certain Penalty for Drunkenne&s;s, provided the Per&s;on were convicted within <HI>three Days</HI> after the Crime was committed; Would Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ay that a <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> might inflict the Penalty on a Man who was not bro't before him 'till the <HI>fourth Day,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> was impracticable; for the Man kept concealed 'till the <HI>three Days</HI> were elap&s;ed? If &s;o, Why mayn't he go one Step further, and if a Man a|greed to &s;ell him a Farm, <HI>provided</HI> &s;uch a Gentleman would be bound with him for the Payment of the Price agreed on, in&s;i&s;t on it that the Man was obliged by the Bargain to let him have the Farm and take his own Bond for the Money; becau&s;e the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> was become impracticable by the Gen|tleman's utterly refu&s;ing to become his Surety.</P>
<P>In a Word, The <HI>Ordination-Office</HI> limit the Prie&s;t to exerci&s;e the Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t <HI>"as this Church and Realm hath received the &s;ame",</HI> the <HI>Rubricks</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI> are the Laws of the Church, according to which the Clergy are &s;worn to yield Obedience. Now the&s;e give the Mini&s;ter no Autho|rity to <HI>try and cen&s;ure</HI> Per&s;on; nor do they authori&s;e him to <HI>&s;u&s;pend in order to Trial,</HI> unle&s;s he inform the proper
<PB N="106" REF="006158_0105_1027F9BBDD7EC800">Judge within fourteen Days, that the Per&s;on may not con|tinue in this State of Su&s;pen&s;ion, but be &s;peedily acquitted or condemned. The Scheme of Di&s;cipline therefore which Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> propo&s;es, as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>religious Liberties</HI> of Mankind, and contrary to the Go&s;pel, &s;o it is repug|nant to the Con&s;titution and Laws of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and con&s;equently if any of your Mini&s;ters act in this arbi|trary Manner, you are under no Obligation as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> or <HI>as Churchmen</HI> to &s;ubmit to their Cen&s;ures. And on the Whole, there is not, according to the Principles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o much as <HI>the Shadow</HI> of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline in the epi&s;copal Churches in <HI>America.</HI> And this renders in <HI>unlawful</HI> to for&s;ake our Churches and go over to that Communion, in which 'tis impracticable to exerci&s;e that Di&s;cipline which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted in his Church, and which is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being of it. But I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. For particular Members of the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Churches to &s;eparate from them, and join in Communion with the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Congregations, is properly <HI>Schi&s;matical.</HI></P>
<P>Every particular Church is a Society formed for promoting the Redeemer's Glory in the Salvation of Sinners, in &s;uch Methods and by &s;uch Means as he has appointed for that End. All the Members of &s;uch a Society are under very &s;acred Obligations to endeavour, according to their &s;everal Places and Capacitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to promote this End; and that <HI>in Con|junction</HI> with one another. The Church, con&s;idered as a Body, has a Right to the Service of every Member, for car|rying on the De&s;igns for which it was formed, by the Means Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted. I limit the Church's Authority, and con&s;equently the particular Members Obligation to the <HI>End</HI> Chri&s;t has appointed and the <HI>Means</HI> he has pre&s;cribed for at|taining it; becau&s;e I believe him to be the only <HI>Law giver</HI> in the Go&s;pel Church; and therefore can't acknowledge any
<PB N="107" REF="006158_0106_1027F9BDAE0E38E0">Man or Body of Men, as ve&s;ted with a <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Authority in the Church, or having a Right to enact <HI>new Ends</HI> of Church Communion, or pre&s;cribe <HI>new Means</HI> for obtaining the End Chri&s;t has appointed.</P>
<P>The Body of a Man is perfect when it has all it's Parts in their due Proportion &amp; Activity, and every Organ or Member di&s;charge it's proper Function for the Good of the Whole: But when any particular Members &s;eparate them&s;elves from the Re&s;t, and refu&s;e to act agreably to their &s;everal Places in the Body and their mutual Relation to one another; as (for In|&s;tance) <HI>If the Foot &s;hall &s;ay, becau&s;e I am not the Head, I am not of the Body,</HI> and &s;hall thereupon refu&s;e to act as a Mem|ber of the Body; or if <HI>the Head</HI> &s;hall <HI>&s;ay to the Feet, I have no need of you,</HI> and &s;hall reject and ca&s;t them off as not being Members of the Body, in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Unity of the Body is di&s;&s;olved. The Apo&s;tle u&s;es this very Compari|&s;on to illu&s;trate this Ca&s;e, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 12,&mdash;27. And this Divi&s;ion of the Members of the &s;ame Body, he expre&s;ly calls a SCHISM, <HI>Ver.</HI> 25. On this Authority many learned Men, and among others, the celebrated Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> define Schi&s;m by <HI>an unnece&s;&s;ary Separation from that Part of the vi&s;i|ble Church of which we once were Members</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>White</HI>'s Defence, <HI>p.</HI> 29.</NOTE> Others make Schi&s;m to be an <HI>uncharitable Separation.</HI> This &s;eems like|wi&s;e to be &s;ugge&s;ted by the Apo&s;tle, when he mentions the <HI>Eye's &s;aying to the Hand, I have no need of thee;</HI> and the <HI>Head to the Feet, I have no need of you, Ver.</HI> 21. which Words as ap|plied to the Members of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical Body, are expre&s;|&s;ive of an haughty, contemptuous and uncharitable Conduct of one towards another. This then &s;eems a plain and fir&s;t Account of the Matter. Every Divi&s;ion or Separation in the Church is <HI>material Schi&s;m;</HI> that is, it is a Di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">niting of tho&s;e Members which once have been, and &s;till ought to be, united in the &s;ame Body. And a Separation which is <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="006158_0107_1027F9C4B99F82B8">and attended with <HI>uncharitable</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions and Conduct to|wards tho&s;e Men divide from, is <HI>formal Schi&s;m;</HI> and by this Men contract, what Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> and I agree to call, the <HI>awful Guilt of Schi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>I am not aware of anything in this De&s;cription of Schi&s;m Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> will be likely to except again&s;t, unle&s;s it be my following Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> in making it con&s;i&s;t in <HI>for&s;aking</HI> a Church, which &s;uppo&s;es a Per&s;on's having been <HI>actually</HI> in Commu|nion with it. This Mr. <HI>White</HI> faults in it, and will have it that it is Schi&s;m to live in a State of Separation from that Church which a Man ought to be in Communion with, tho' he never actually was &s;o. And tho' I apprehend Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s Difinition may be ju&s;tified from the Apo&s;tle's Di&s;cour&s;e on this Head; yet &s;ince a good Cau&s;e allows of a generous Con|duct, and mine in particular will bear the large&s;t Conce&s;&s;ions that can rea&s;onably be de&s;ired, I will not conte&s;t this Point; but allow that it is the &s;ame Thing in this Ca&s;e, whether a Per|&s;on were actually a Member of a Church and &s;eparated from it, or under evident Obligations to become a Member of it, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed the Communion of it.</P>
<P>There is hardly anything more contrary to the Nature of true Religion, or more de&s;tructive to the vi&s;ible Kingdom of the Redeemer, than a <HI>&s;chi&s;matical</HI> Temper, or a Di&s;po&s;ition uncharitably to cen&s;ure and unnece&s;&s;arily to &s;eparate from tho&s;e with whom we ought to maintain Love and Commu|nion. By this, whenever it prevails, the &s;eamle&s;s Coat of Chri&s;t is rent in Pieces; nay his Body is di&s;-jointed and bro|ken; the vi&s;ible Church, which ought to appear and behave like the Spou&s;e of the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> is rendred a meer Scene of Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion; and profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, in&s;tead of wearing the Livery of Chri&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts of Love and Meekne&s;s, Humility and Peaceablene&s;s, are cloa|thed with Hatred and Revenge, Pride and Malice, the very Temper of the infernal Spirits. By the&s;e Means the holy
<PB N="109" REF="006158_0108_1027F9C784CC60D8">and dove-like Spirit is grieved, and &s;o withdraws his &s;pecial Influences from Go&s;pel Admini&s;trations; the awful Event of which is, that the Means of Grace prove <HI>a Savour of Death unto Death,</HI> in&s;tead of being, as they were originally de&s;igned, the <HI>Savour of Life unto Life.</HI> The <HI>Guilt</HI> contracted by Schi&s;m is great in Proportion to the evil and de&s;tructive Con|&s;equences which flow from it. Mr <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;ays, <Q><HI>If it be every Man's indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to be a Chri&s;tian, the &s;ame Duty will oblige him to be and continue a Member of the Church which is his Body, to pre&s;erve and maintain the Peace, Order and Unity of the Body, and e&s;pecially of that Part to which he particularly belongs.</HI></Q> <HI>p.</HI> 37. And I hope this <HI>"will be attended to more &s;eriou&s;ly as coming from him".</HI> Nay he profe&s;&s;es &s;uch a Dread of this Guilt, that if he could think it contracted by Per&s;ons for&s;aking our Churches and embra|cing the epi&s;copal Communion in this Country, he would per&s;wade all again&s;t doing it. <HI>p.</HI> 28. I am glad he has this Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience in the Ca&s;e, and as I make no Doubt of proving this Guilt upon you, great and awful as it is, &s;hall rejoice in his joining with me in endeavouring your Recovery out of &s;o dangerous an E&s;tate. And as a Means of this, &s;hould be glad he would go on with the De&s;ign he men|tions, in the Clo&s;e of his <HI>Defence</HI> of Dr. <HI>Waterland,</HI> of pub|li&s;hing a Tran&s;lation of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Church Unity.</P>
<P>That your Conduct in &s;eparating from us di&s;turbs the Peace of the Churches you thus for&s;ake, Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> owns, <HI>p.</HI> 29. <Q><HI>I will allow that Divi&s;ions may be in fact made, in &s;uch Com|munities which Men leave, when they go into the Communion of the Church of</HI> England <HI>in</HI> Connecticut. <HI>The&s;e Societies which they call Churches, may be rent and divided by the withdrawing of &s;ome of their Members.</HI></Q> Another Con|ce&s;&s;ion he makes in the&s;e Words, <HI>p.</HI> 28. <Q><HI>I will allow that making Divi&s;ions in, and Separations from regular Chri&s;tian Societies, with which we are obliged to join in Chri&s;tian Fel|low&s;hip
<PB N="110" REF="006158_0109_1027F9C90D857CA0">and Communion, is Schi&s;m, and very criminal in the Sight of God, and never to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;tified or excu&s;ed before Man.</HI></Q> The&s;e two Conce&s;&s;ions are &s;ufficient to fix this Guilt upon you; and I hope will be effectual for convincing your Con&s;ciences of it. For here you &s;ee your own Advo|cate allows, that you were once in Communion with us, and have now withdraw from us, and that in &s;uch a Manner as in Fact to make Rents and Divi&s;ions in the Societies you &s;e|parated from; and that to do this in regular Chri&s;tian Socie|ties &mdash;is Schi&s;m. The&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions of his leave you no po&s;|&s;ible Way to prevent this Guilt's falling with all it's dreadful Weight upon your Heads; unle&s;s you will directly a&s;&s;ert that the Societies you &s;eparated from were not <HI>true</HI> Churches of Chri&s;t. And I am per&s;waded that many of you, <HI>my Bre|thren,</HI> are not &s;o far gone in a Party Spirit, and &s;o eaten up with Bigottry as ab&s;olutely to unchurch us and almo&s;t the whole Prote&s;tant World, and declare all our Admini&s;trations null and invalid. Surely you will not be fond of making &s;uch a Declaration as this, when you remember that the Bapti&s;m by which you believe you were, <Q><HI>made Members of Chri&s;t, Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven</HI></Q> was received in our Churches; for if our's are not Chri&s;tian Churches, your's was not Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m; and con&s;equently, notwith&s;tanding your having conformed to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> you are not Members of the Church of Chri&s;t. But if, notwith&s;tanding the Con&s;equences of it on your own vi&s;ible Chri&s;tianity, any of you are determined, at all Adventures, to deny our being true Churches of Chri&s;t, I hope, at lea&s;t, you will not for the future pretend, that your Separation from us has been attended with no Uncha|ritablene&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wetmors</HI> &s;ays, <Q><HI>It will lay upon Mr.</HI> Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt <HI>to prove their Societies to be regularly con&s;tituted Churches of Chri&s;t, before the Guilt of rending the Body of Chri&s;t can be fixed up|on Separators from them. This will prove a very hard Ta&s;k,
<PB N="111" REF="006158_0110_1027F9CAAEDF8AD0">he mu&s;t go through it, before his Charge of Schi&s;m will lay again&s;t</HI> ANY SORT OF SEPARATORS FROM THEM.</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 29. By <HI>"any Sort of Separators",</HI> I conclude he means <HI>you,</HI> and &s;uch as have run into what is commonly called the <HI>New-Light</HI> Separation in the Country. You may thank him (if you think he de&s;erves your Thanks) for appearing in De|fence of the <HI>New Light</HI> Separati&s;ts, and &s;etting your Cau&s;e and their's on a Level. His doing &s;o gave me the Hint of treat|ing <HI>you</HI> and <HI>them</HI> as &s;tanding on the &s;ame Foot; and I had Thoughts of drawing at large <HI>a Parallel between the New-Light and Epi&s;copal Separati&s;ts,</HI> in Regard to the <HI>Principles</HI> they act upon, the <HI>End</HI> they have in view, the <HI>Means</HI> they make U&s;e of, and the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> they are actuated by. A Thing of this Nature, I apprehend, would have a Ten|dency to open the Eyes of many deluded People on both Sides; but I have not Room for it at pre&s;ent. If Mr. <HI>Wet|more</HI> would have you and the <HI>other Separators</HI> think that you need not fear having the Guilt of Schi&s;m charged upon you, until I prove our Churches regularly con&s;tituted; he impo&s;es upon you, and you are in Danger of being led into a fatal Mi&s;take. There are many Things by which you may con|tract great Guilt, and for which you may be condemned for|ever, which I have never proved to be &s;inful; and if I am as unable to prove the Sinfulne&s;s of them, as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> &s;up|po&s;es I am to prove the Regularity of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con|&s;titution, my Weakne&s;s does not alter the Nature of Things, nor will it excu&s;e you from Guilt and Condemnation. But if he means no more, by the Pa&s;&s;age la&s;t quoted, than that <HI>I</HI> can't properly bring &s;uch a Charge again&s;t you 'till I have pro|ved this; he di&s;covers a Want of Acquaintance with the Laws of Argumentation. For it is allowed in all Di&s;putes, that when a Per&s;on is charged with any Crime, if he confe&s;&s;es the Fact, and pleads anything &s;pecial in Ju&s;tification of it, <HI>it</HI> lies upon him to prove the &s;pecial Matter thus pleaded. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> therefore, when he had a&s;&s;umed the Province of vindicating your Conduct, and pleaded in your Behalf, that
<PB N="112" REF="006158_0111_1027F9CE2A3D27F8">the Societies you for&s;ook, were &s;uch as you had a Right to for&s;ake, or &s;uch, the &s;eparating from which, was not Schi&s;m; ought to have looked on him&s;elf obliged to make this Plea good, and 'till he does this, the Charge of Schi&s;m lies well a|gain&s;t you. But he is &s;o far from doing this, that he dare not directly and openly a&s;&s;ert the Fact, that our Churches are &s;uch as a Man may &s;eparate from without Danger of incurring this Guilt.

1. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> has not repre&s;ented the Fact, in the&s;e In|&s;tances, exactly as it was. It is difficult gaining a certain In|formation concerning Facts of &s;o ancient a Date, and of which, &s;o far as I can learn, there are no Records remaining. The be&s;t Account I have been able to get, is, Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> was ordained by Mr. <HI>Whiting</HI> of <HI>Hartford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the Elder of the Church of <HI>Guilford</HI> laying on Hands in Conjunction with the&s;e Mini&s;ters. This Ac|count I have from a Gentleman of Note in <HI>Guilford,</HI> who &s;ays it was what he had often heard from the mo&s;t aged Peo|ple he has conver&s;ed with there; and as he is a Man in Years, he mu&s;t have been conver&s;ant with &s;uch as well remembred the Fact. In Confirmation of this, I am a&s;&s;ured by a Mi|ni&s;ter now living, that Major <HI>Fitch</HI> of <HI>Norwich,</HI> who has been dead many Years, a&s;&s;ured him, he was him&s;elf pre&s;ent at Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI>'s Ordination, and &s;aw it performed by a Num|ber of Mini&s;ters, and one of the Members of that Church. Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> of <HI>Milford</HI> has often told a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, that Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Ordination was performed by Mini&s;ters and the Elder of the Church of <HI>Stratford.</HI> I have conver&s;ed with an aged Man at <HI>Stratford,</HI> who remem|bers Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Ordination, but cannot, at this Di&s;tance of Time, recollect who the Per&s;ons were that laid on Hands. He tells me, that he well remembers Mr. <HI>Blackman</HI>'s being living, and his baptizing a Child when Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> preach'd at <HI>Stratford,</HI> and he thinks Mr. <HI>Blackman</HI> lived &s;ome Time after Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Ordination. This Circum&s;tance &s;trongly argues again&s;t a Lay-Ordination, for the Clau&s;e in the <HI>Cam|bridge Platform</HI> which &s;peaks mo&s;t favourably of the Power of the Laity in this Ca&s;e, allows it only <Q><HI>in &s;uch Churches where there are no Elders.</HI></Q> I confe&s;s I am not &s;o certain that any Mini&s;ter actually laid Hands on Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> at his Ordination. I am informed, from tho&s;e that have had Oppor|tunity of conver&s;ing with &s;uch as remembred the Fact, that there was an <HI>Ordination Council</HI> called. They have been told by the aged People at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> and Mr.
<PB N="114" REF="006158_0113_1027F9D508DF3D80"><HI>Fitch</HI> were two of the Mini&s;ters that compo&s;ed the Council. I am farther informed by one of the mo&s;t aged Mini&s;ters in the Country, that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> was likewi&s;e a Member of the Council, and informed him, that there was a Motion made in the Council to act upon the Clau&s;e in the <HI>Platform</HI> above referred to; but he does not remember whe|ther Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> told him the Motion was complied with or rejected, he rather thinks it was rejected. Upon the Whole, the wor&s;t that can be &s;uppo&s;ed in the Ca&s;e, is that &s;ome of the Brethren of <HI>Saybrook</HI> Church did, under the In&s;pection and by the Order of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, lay Hands on Mr. <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and that thereupon the Mini&s;ters pre&s;ent gave him the <HI>Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip,</HI> acknowledging him as a lawfully authorized Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, Now &s;up|po&s;ing the Facts to be thus, tho' I believe each of the Ordi|nations to have been, in &s;ome Degree, irregular; yet I can't think the mo&s;t exceptionable of them to be ab&s;olutely invalid. I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> thinks <HI>Impo&s;ition of commi&s;&s;ionated Hands</HI> &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in the Ca&s;e, that a Bi&s;hop who, by Di&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or Accident, was entirely de|prived of the U&s;e of his Hands, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily loo&s;e the Power of ordaining. Nobody, I &s;uppo&s;e, looks upon mi|ni&s;terial Authority as &s;uch a <HI>phy&s;ical Quality</HI> as is communi|cable only by <HI>Contact.</HI> The Impo&s;ition of Hands in Ordi|nation, and of <HI>"commi&s;&s;ionated Hands",</HI> as it is authorized by the In&s;tances recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, I believe ought to be retained in the Church of Chri&s;t; nor would I my &s;elf be ordained without it: But if any Per&s;on who has Authority to ordain be incapable of performing it, or thinks it not nece&s;&s;ary and therefore omits it; or if he thinks it may be performed by <HI>Delegation,</HI> and &s;o orders others to do it in his Pre&s;ence, I dare not &s;ay that his Incapacity or his Mi&s;take nullifies the Action, or renders the Ordination in|valid.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e In&s;tances, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be as bad as Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> would have them, can in no Mea&s;ure ju&s;tify you in
<PB N="115" REF="006158_0114_1027F9D6932156C0">&s;eparating from us. I will, for once, &s;uppo&s;e that each of the&s;e was a <HI>merely Lay-Ordination;</HI> and that the Per&s;ons thus ordained had no Sort of mini&s;terial Authority, no more Bu|&s;ine&s;s to preach the Go&s;pel or admini&s;ter the Sacraments than any other <HI>Layman</HI> whom&s;oever. This is all you can de&s;ire in the Ca&s;e, and this, for Argument &s;ake, I will &s;uppo&s;e. Now what will this do towards ju&s;tifying your Separation? The&s;e Gentlemen were dead before mo&s;t of you wer born; I &s;up|po&s;e long before any one of you for&s;ook our Communion. It was not the Mini&s;try of the&s;e Gentlemen that you for&s;ook, but of others, who were ordained by Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Mini&s;ters. Mr. <HI>Wetmore</HI> does indeed pretend that our pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t many of them, derive their Ordi|nation from tho&s;e Gentlemen, but of this he produces not the lea&s;t Shadow of Evidence; nor is there any Probability that &s;o much as one Mini&s;ter in the Country derives his Ordi|nation from the&s;e Gentlemen <HI>only.</HI> You all know that Or|dinations with us are performed by a con&s;iderable Number of Mini&s;ters. There is no Probability that the&s;e three Men ever joined in the Ordination of the &s;ame Per&s;on; tho' they might, and no Doubt did, each of them join with other Mi|ni&s;ters in Ordinations. In a Word, make this Ca&s;e as bad as you will, the Argument drawn from it can't excu&s;e any particular Per&s;on among you from the Guilt of Schi&s;m, un|le&s;s, before he &s;eparated from us, he had <HI>full and convincing Proof,</HI> that the Mini&s;ter he was about to for&s;ake, derived his Ordination <HI>wholly and only</HI> from the&s;e Men; and this, I am confident, there is not a &s;ingle Man among you will pre|tend to. So far were you from this, that I dare confidently appeal to your own Con&s;ciences, whether you did not act upon <HI>other Rea&s;ons</HI> in for&s;aking us; and when you found tho&s;e other Rea&s;ons were not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify you, trump up this Pretence to excu&s;e your continuing in a Separation, which you could not defend on the Principles you acted upon in making the Separation. It was thus with a Number that &s;eparated from the Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Norwalk,</HI> they
<PB N="116" REF="006158_0115_1027F9D9DB05EC48">pretended to be greatly grieved and offended at Mr. <HI>Dickin|&s;on</HI>'s reading the Scriptures in publick Wor&s;hip; this they call'd <HI>Popery,</HI> and for this they exhibited their Complaints a|gain&s;t him; and when they could not have him cen&s;ured for this Crime, they &s;eparated from him, and declared them&s;elves of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Communion.</HI> The Mem who acted upon this Principle were care&s;&s;ed by the Party they turn'd to, and the <HI>Society</HI> had pompous Accounts &s;ent them of the Growth of the Church. The&s;e Per&s;ons evidently di&s;covered their Want of Sincerity. The publick Reading of the Scriptures did not offend their Con&s;ciences, for they could immediately join the epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies, in which this is always practi&s;ed. And when the&s;e Per&s;ons come to be &s;en&s;ible that the Rea&s;ons they profe&s;&s;ed to act upon will not ju&s;tify them, they have Recour&s;e to this, That Somebody has told them, that he has heard, that there were, almo&s;t an hundred Years ago, two or three <HI>di&s;putable</HI> Ordinations in this Country. When in Truth, if the&s;e Men could have had their Wills, by procuring a Cen&s;ure again&s;t their Mini&s;ter for reading the <HI>Bible,</HI> they would no more have been influenced in their Conduct by tho&s;e old Stories of <HI>Lay-Ordinations,</HI> than they would have been by the Di&s;putes between the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Avig|non;</HI> as indeed they were really no more concerned with the one than the other. So dreadfully do Men prevaricate with that God <HI>who cannot be deceived, and will not be mocked.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="3">3. This can't po&s;&s;ibly excu&s;e your for&s;aking us, and join|ing with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;try in that Church is full as di&s;putable as you can pretend to make it with us.</HI> There would be &s;ome Con&s;i&s;tency in your Pretence of for&s;aking us for want of a <HI>regular Succe&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try,</HI> if you could have found and had embraced a Communion in which the Succe&s;&s;ion was <HI>clear and undi&s;puted.</HI> But you mu&s;t give me Leave to que&s;tion your Acquaintance with <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory,</HI> if you &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;uch a Com|munion
<PB N="117" REF="006158_0116_1027F9DDE389ABE8">on Earth. I am &s;ure the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Church of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>very much di&s;puted.</HI> The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;ay it was broken at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> that it was &s;o at the <HI>Revolution.</HI> And 'tis pa&s;t all Doubt with me, that, on the Principles you generally embrace, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give a fair An&s;wer to either of them. You have been taught, and in your Di&s;putes with us on this Head you profe&s;s to be|lieve, That it is <HI>e&s;&s;ential to a lawful Mini&s;ter</HI> of Chri&s;t, that he derive his Commi&s;&s;ion in an <HI>uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> from the Apo&s;tles; that is, that every Man in the direct Line of Succe&s;&s;ion between any pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter and &s;ome one of the Apo&s;tles, was regularly and lawfully ordained. And it is a|nother of your Principles, That when the mini&s;terial Com|mi&s;&s;ion is thus regularly given, it cannot be taken away by any other Authority than that which gave it.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Principles it will be not only <HI>"a very hard Ta&s;k",</HI> but ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent Mi|ni&s;try in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reformers had very different Notions of the&s;e Things, and acted in a Manner not to be ju&s;tified on the&s;e Principles. And indeed, however fond a Sett of hot Men, who have been di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of <HI>High-Flyers,</HI> and who have always been &s;u&s;pec|ted of having a &s;trong Inclination to return to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Communion, may have been of the&s;e Notions; yet the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as a Body, has on many Occa&s;ions acted in Defiance of them; &s;o often that there is no &s;uch Thing as ju&s;tifying the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try in that Church, without giving up the&s;e Principles.</P>
<P>If we look back to the glorious and happy REVOLUTION, which &s;ecured you and us in the Enjoyment of all our Liber|ties civil and &s;acred, we find Dr. <HI>Sancroft,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Primate and Metropolitan of all <HI>England;</HI> Dr. <HI>Kenn,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells;</HI> Dr. <HI>Turner,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely;</HI> Dr. <HI>Frampton,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter;</HI> Dr. <HI>White,</HI> Bi&s;hop of

in one Day, by Virtue of AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT. Their <HI>Deprivation</HI> bears Date <HI>February</HI> 1. 1690<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Salmons</HI> Chronlogy.</NOTE>. The&s;e Bi&s;hops were not turned out for Here&s;y, or any other <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Crime;</HI> but for refu&s;ing to take the Oaths to King WILLIAM and Queen MARY. And their Places in the Church were &s;oon &s;upplied with others, as though they had been dead. Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> being made Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury, May</HI> 31. and &s;oon after, Dr. <HI>Kidder</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> Dr. <HI>Fowler</HI> or <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cumberland</HI> of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Norwich.</HI> This occa&s;ioned a Divi&s;ion in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which continues to this Day, and is likely to remain; for tho' the deprived Bi&s;hops are all dead, yet they and their Adherents took Care to perpetuate the Schi&s;m they had made, by conti|nuing a Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops in this Line. The <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> or tho&s;e who adhere to the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Line of the <HI>de|prived Bi&s;hops,</HI> look upon the <HI>Revolution Church,</HI> as they call you, as being in a State of Schi&s;m for joining in Communion with, and &s;ubmitting to the pre&s;ent Sett of Bi&s;hops, whom they e&s;teem as U&s;urpers; becau&s;e they took the Places of &s;uch Bi&s;hops as they &s;uppo&s;e were unlawfully deprived; or rather not deprived at all, for they will by no Means allow that an Act of Parliament can deprive a Bi&s;hop, who is a &s;piritual Officer. This Argument has been warmly urged again&s;t you by the <HI>Nonjurors;</HI> and tho' I make no Doubt the Schi&s;m lies wholly on their Side, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I &s;ee no Po&s;&s;ibility of an&s;wering their Arguments, without giving up the Principles you e&s;pou&s;e when you are di&s;puting with us. And &s;hould God, for the Sins of the Nation, ever &s;uffer the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> to be &s;et a&s;ide, you are to expect that the Succe&s;&s;ors of the deprived Bi&s;hops, would be declared the <HI>true Pa&s;tors</HI> of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> you, and the Bi&s;hops
<PB N="119" REF="006158_0118_1027F9E37976DC78">you &s;ubmit to, would be look'd upon as Schi&s;matick, and your Ordinations declared invalid; &s;o that your Clergy wou'd have a Chance for taking another Voyage for Orders.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>Nonjurors</HI> them&s;elves would get little by &s;uch a Change; for it is but going one Step farther, and we &s;hall find that they and you both are cut off from this Line of Suc|ce&s;&s;ion you are both &s;o unrea&s;onably fond of. 'Tis a Fact known to all who are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Reformation, that when Queen ELIZABETH came to the Crown, the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church were, to a Man, bigotted <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI> There was not a &s;ingle Man of them ac|tive in the Reformation, and only <HI>Kitchin</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> that would &s;ubmit to it, when it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Queen and Parliament. All the other Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> were de|prived or turned out of their Offices by Act of Parliament, for refu&s;ing the <HI>Oath of Supremacy.</HI> This was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Heath</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York, Bonner</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London, Ton&s;tal</HI> of <HI>Durham, Thur&s;by</HI> of <HI>Ely, Bourn</HI> of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Chri&s;|topher&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chiche&s;ter, White</HI> of <HI>Winche&s;ter, Wat&s;on</HI> of <HI>Lin|coln, Bayne</HI> of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield, Oglethorp</HI> of <HI>Carli&s;le, Turnbervile</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and <HI>Poole</HI> of <HI>Peterborough;</HI> all the other Bi&s;hopricks being at that Time vacant, except <HI>Landoff,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of which complied and kept his Office<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle <HI>p.</HI> 331.</NOTE>.

<P>Thus you &s;ee that, at the Revolution, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with five other Bi&s;hops, and at the Reformation the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> with all the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="006158_0119_1027F9E63A9B8A40">Church, one only excepted, were turned out of their Offices by Act of Parliament. The&s;e are &s;o many In&s;tances of <HI>Lay-Deprivation,</HI> which is as directly contrary to your darling Principles, and as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Notion of an <HI>uninter|rupted</HI> Line of Succe&s;&s;ion as <HI>Lay-Ordination;</HI> for <HI>Laymewn</HI> have as much Authority to <HI>make Bi&s;hops</HI> as to <HI>unmake</HI> them. That the <HI>Line of Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> was broken, in the&s;e In&s;tances, is very clear; for it Dr. <HI>Sancroft</HI> continued Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his being deprived by Act of Par|liament, which all who deny the Validity of <HI>Lay-Deprivations</HI> mu&s;t &s;ay; all the Con&s;ecrations in the World could not make Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> lawful Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> while <HI>Sancroft</HI> lived. So that if the <HI>Con&s;ecrations,</HI> in the&s;e In&s;tances, were ever &s;o <HI>canonical</HI> and undi&s;puted, yet the Succe&s;&s;ion would be broken by the&s;e Bi&s;hops being put in the Places of &s;uch as were deprived by tho&s;e who according to your Principles, had not Authority to deprive them.</P>
<P>But further, it is a lea&s;t very que&s;tionable, whether the the Bi&s;hops who &s;ucceeded tho&s;e deprived at the Reformation were regularly ordained. The famous Story of the <HI>Nag's-Head Con&s;ecration</HI> is a full Match for what you &s;o often tell us of the <HI>Leather-Mitten Ordination;</HI> with this Advantage on our Side, that there is no Probability that any one of our Mini&s;ters derives his Ordination from Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> of <HI>Strat|ford;</HI> but it is certain that all your's derive from Dr. <HI>Parker</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But to take the mo&s;t favourable Account of this Matter, Archbi&s;hop <HI>Parker,</HI> who con&s;ecrated all the Re&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops, was him&s;elf con&s;ecrated by <HI>Barlow, Scory, Coverdale</HI> and <HI>Hodgkins,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> tells us from the Life of <HI>Parker</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Puritans</HI> Vol. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 142.</NOTE> The&s;e Men had been Bi&s;hops in the Reign of EDWARD VI, but were legally deprived in Queen MARY'S Reign, and had never been re&s;tored; and it is, at

To go on, How many are there of you, who refu&s;e to hold occa&s;ional Communion with us in the Word of God and Prayer, who, when you have not Op|portunity to attend the Church-Service, chu&s;e rather wholly to omit the publick Wor&s;hip of God than to join with us in it?

Upon the Whole, It appears evident to me, that Men, by &s;eparating from our Churches, and joining in Communion with the epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies in this Country, do really con|tract the awful Guilt of Schi&s;m, as their Separation is unne|ce&s;&s;ary and uncharitable. It will, I hope, tend to convince you of this, if I conclude this Head with the Sentiments of one of our Mini&s;ters, for whom, tho&s;e of you who know him, profe&s;s a great Regard, who has been thought to have &s;tudied this Controver&s;y with a Mind &s;omething inclined to your Side of the Que&s;tion, and whom you have more than once boa&s;ted of as one that was on the Point of declaring in your Favour. This Gentleman was plea&s;ed, not long &s;ince, to favour me with the <HI>Re&s;ult of his Enquiries</HI> into this Subject, and the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> that obliged him to continue in our Com|munion. Among other Things, he &s;ays, <Q><HI>I &s;hould be guilty of</HI> SCHISM <HI>in the proper Sen&s;e of the Word, &s;hould I break off from our Con&s;titution and join with them. And I wi&s;h this Matter was laid home to them that have done &s;o. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to me, to hear one of our</HI> New-England <HI>Gentleman, who was baptized by a</HI> Pre&s;byterian Teacher <HI>(as they affect to call us) vapouring and &s;waggering of</HI> un|interupted Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>and</HI> be&s;t con&s;tituted Church in the World, <HI>and pronouncing</HI> NULITY <HI>upon all our Admini&s;tra|tions. This is, with me, perfect</HI> Farce <HI>and</HI> Comedy. <HI>The mo&s;t</HI> raving Enthu&s;ia&s;t <HI>does not appear in a more contempti|ble Figure,</HI>&mdash;BIGOTTRY <HI>is too &s;oft a Term to expre&s;s it by.

<P>I will add but one argument more to prove the <HI>Unlawful|ne&s;s</HI> of &s;eparating from our Churches, and joining the epi&s;co|pal Communion, and &s;o conclude my Di&s;cour&s;e, which has already run to a greater Length and I de&s;igned.</P>

Indeed I can't learn, that there are above two or three Mi|ni&s;ters within the Confines of that Government</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sea&s;onable Thoughts, <HI>p.</HI> 414.</NOTE>.</Q> In the Year 1744, <HI>Clement Hall,</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; one of the Magi&s;trates of that Province, went to <HI>England,</HI> repre&s;ented to the Society the Nece&s;&s;ity of a further Supply of Mini&s;ters in that Govern|ment, and offered him&s;elf to take Orders and accept a Mi&s;|&s;ion there. This Offer the Society complied with, tho' they allowed Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> but <HI>thirty</HI> Pounds a Year<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tr. for the Year 1744. <HI>p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> while the Mi&s;&s;ionaries in <HI>New-England</HI> generally have <HI>&s;ixty</HI> or upward. This is all I can find the Society have done for this <HI>peri&s;hing People.</HI> The la&s;t Account I have &s;een of them is in the&s;e Words, <Q><HI>The Society are very &s;en&s;ible, that were there more Clergymen and Schoolma&s;ters of the Church of</HI> England <HI>&s;ettled in this Province, they would be very fully, and to very good Purpo&s;e employed; and the Governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Province hath been made acquainted, that if proper Provi&s;ion &s;hall be mads there towards their Support, the Society are ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them therein</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tr. for the Year 1746. <HI>p.</HI> 55.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The Society, whatever the Rea&s;ons of it are, do not treat all the <HI>Briti&s;h Plantations</HI> in this Manner. The Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> has about <HI>an hundred and fifty</HI> Pre&s;byterian or Con|gregational Mini&s;ters in it, the large&s;t Number of Mini&s;ters
<PB N="132" REF="006158_0131_1027FA0AE666BFE0">in Proportion to the Number of People, I &s;uppo&s;e, of any <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colony in <HI>America,</HI> yet the Society have been &s;o kind as to erect <HI>eight Mi&s;&s;ions</HI> in it, be&s;ides paying <HI>two Schoolma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>one Catechi&s;t,</HI> and I can't learn that they ever wrote to the Governour of this Colony, that they would &s;end no more unle&s;s the A&s;&s;embly would make Provi&s;ion for their Support.</P>
<P>The true Rea&s;on why there is &s;o little done for tho&s;e Places that &s;o greatly need the Society's Help, is becau&s;e &s;o much is thrown away where it is not at all needed, and indeed, where it does rather Hurt than Good. The Rea&s;on why <HI>North-Carolina</HI> is left to &s;ink into Athei&s;m, <HI>Maryland</HI> to become a Prey to Popery, and the va&s;t <HI>Indian Nations</HI> to peri&s;h in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Heatheni&s;m, is becau&s;e the large Sums of Money in|tru&s;ted to the Management of the Society, in&s;tead of being employed to propagate the Go&s;pel, are applied to &s;upport the epi&s;copal Separation in <HI>New-England,</HI> and other Places, where Chri&s;tian Churches are already erected, tho' not in the epi&s;|copal Form. The Society do in Effect acknowledge this. <Q><HI>In</HI> New-England <HI>the Number of the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> (&s;ays their pre&s;ent Secretary) <HI>have been continually in|crea&s;ing from their fir&s;t In&s;titution, and at this Time</HI> nine|teen Mi&s;&s;ionaries <HI>are &s;upported by them therein, and could the Society, in</HI> PRUDENCE AND JUSTICE <HI>to the pre&s;&s;ing De&s;ires of the other Colonies, an&s;wer the importunate De|mands of this very populous Province for new Mi&s;&s;ionaries, they mu&s;t at lea&s;t double the Number</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Bancroft<HI>'s Sermon</HI> (printed by Order of the Society) p. <HI>9.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I rejoice to find the Society at length convinced, that JUSTICE to the other Colonies will not permit them to in|crea&s;e the Number of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries in <HI>New-England.</HI> And I hope God will put it into their Hearts &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider
<PB N="133" REF="006158_0132_1027D9A695EBE0A0">whether it be not really <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> and an evident Mi&s;ap|plication of the Charity of the Nation, to apply any Part of the Money given for the <HI>Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> to the Support of a Party in <HI>New-England,</HI> while &s;o many of the Plantations are really abandoned to Athei&s;m and Infidelity, or le&s;t as a Prey to <HI>Romi&s;h Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Je&s;uites;</HI> and while large Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> bordering upon us, are wholly igno|rant of the only true GOD, and have never heard of the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST. And I heartily wi&s;h the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i|onaries</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and tho&s;e young Gentlemen who are de&s;igning to take Mi&s;&s;ions in this Country, or any other, where the Go&s;pel is already fully preached, would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what an Appearance they will make at la&s;t, and what a Reception they are to expect, when it &s;hall be found that they were &s;upported in Ea&s;e and Plenty, by Money de|voted to the Propagation of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;pent their Lives (at be&s;t) in converting Men from one Profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity to another, and perhaps from a better to a wor&s;e; and that to encrea&s;e the Number of their Pro&s;elites they carried Party Principles to an uncharitable Length, countenanced unea&s;y and di&s;affected Per&s;ons, and admitted to the &s;pecial Privileges of the Go&s;pel tho&s;e immoral Per&s;ons who fled to them to &s;helter them&s;elves from tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Cen&s;ures they ju&s;tly de&s;erved&mdash;.</P>
<P>But I return</P>
<P>This is, I think, &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Increa&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Separation in <HI>New-England,</HI> in&s;tead of being an Enlargement of the Redeemer's Kingdom in the World, is really a very great Hindrance to the Growth of it. Had not the Society been diverted from their original De&s;ign by your <HI>"important Demands for Mi&s;&s;ionaries",</HI> what great Advances might have been made toward recovering to a Sen&s;e of Re|ligion, tho&s;e Colonies where there are hardly any Foot&s;teps of it to be found? And how much might have been done towards converting the neighbouring heatheni&s;h Nations to
<PB N="134" REF="006158_0133_1027FA0F97A8CEF8">the Belief and Practice of the Chri&s;tian Religion? Sure I am, that the Money the Society have expended in &s;upport|ing Mi&s;&s;ionaries in <HI>New-England,</HI> is &s;ufficient (with that Ble&s;&s;ing which might rea&s;onably have been expected in &s;o pious a De&s;ign) to have accompli&s;hed great Things of this Nature. Had it not then been much better on the Whole, much more for the Advantage of the common Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, that you had contentedly remained in our Com|munion, even &s;uppo&s;ing our Con&s;titution more imperfect than that of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> What Advantages have you derived from the <HI>Separation</HI> that can countervail the Damage it has done by hindring the Enlargement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and preventing the Salvation of &s;o many precious and immortal Souls? Is <HI>New-England</HI> become a more religious Country by Means of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ions</HI> that have been erected in it? Fix upon any one Place, and make the Trial. <HI>Stratford</HI> is the olde&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the Society have maintained a Mini&s;ter there for almo&s;t <HI>thirty</HI> Years, and have now a Catechi&s;t and Schoolma&s;ter in their Pay. They have in the whole expended in <HI>Stratford</HI> better than <HI>twenty thou&s;and Pounds</HI> this Currency, a Sum which, if properly applied, might have been the Means of converting an whole Nation of Heathen. But what good Effects has it produced in <HI>Stratford?</HI> Will it be pretended that the People in general are by this Means become more &s;ober and &s;eriou&s;ly religious? Are there fewer <HI>prayerle&s;s Families,</HI> in Proportion to the Number of People, than there were <HI>thirty</HI> Years ago? Is the <HI>Lord's Day more &s;trictly ob&s;erved,</HI> or the <HI>publick Wor&s;hip more generally attended?</HI> Is there le&s;s <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Extravagance?</HI> Are <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Quarreling, Drunkenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Uncleanne&s;s</HI> grown more out of Fa&s;hion? If all the&s;e Que&s;tions mu&s;t be an&s;wered in the negative, and the People of <HI>Stratford</HI> are no better in Point of practical Religion than they were before they had a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> &s;ettled among them, or than in all Probability they would have been if the Society had done nothing for them, it mu&s;t, I think, unavoidably follow, that
<PB N="135" REF="006158_0134_1027FA13E10DDE48">there has been no Equivalent produced for the Lo&s;s to the general Intere&s;t of Religion, occa&s;ioned by the Mi&s;applica|tion of this <HI>twenty thou&s;and Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>I have now gone through what I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed. The Arguments I have offered under each Head, are &s;uch as ap|peared to me <HI>plain</HI> and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood: And I have endeavoured to &s;et them in &s;uch a Light as I thought mo&s;t likely to <HI>inform</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> you. My own Con&s;cience, on a calm Review, acquits me of having <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> mi&s;repre&s;en|ted any Fact, or impo&s;ed on you by any fallacious Ways of arguing. The&s;e Arguments appear to me fully &s;uffici|ent to prove that it was neither NECESSARY in Point of Duty, nor PROPER in Point of Prudence, nor indeed &s;o much as LAWFUL for you to &s;eparate from us, as you have done; and con&s;equently that you are <HI>in Duty bound</HI> to return to our Communion, which you have &s;infully for&s;aken. And the Arguments offered do, at lea&s;t, de&s;erve your <HI>calm</HI> and <HI>&s;erious</HI> Con&s;ideration. To which if you add &s;uch earne&s;t and fervent Prayers to the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> and <HI>Fountain of Truth,</HI> as the Importance of the Affair plainly requires, I &s;hall entertain great Hope of your Condition and Recovery.</P>
<P>You deceive your&s;elves, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> if you think this a Matter of <HI>very &s;mall</HI> Con&s;equence. For be&s;ides the great Guilt you have contracted by &s;uch an <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>uncha|ritable Separation;</HI> I can't help thinking you mu&s;t <HI>now</HI> be in &s;ome Degree &s;en&s;ible that your Conduct has had an unhappy Influence on practical Religion in this Country; as well as on the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity abroad in the World; or at lea&s;t that you mu&s;t have &s;ome Fears that this has been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Look round you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> and count the In&s;tances (if indeed you can find any) of Per&s;ons who were loo&s;e, pro|fain and immoral in their Lives when they for&s;ook us, and
<PB N="136" REF="006158_0135_1027FA15A075F790">are become practically religious, or &s;ober vertuous Men by joining the epi&s;copal Separation. Or, if you chu&s;e it, take a View of &s;uch as appeared to be religious Per&s;ons when they left our Communion, and &s;ee if they appear to grow more holy, humble, and circum&s;pect in their Behaviour. Exa|mine your &s;elves, and &s;ee what you have gained by this Change. Do you find a quicker and more <HI>affecting Sen&s;e</HI> of your Mi&s;ery and Danger while under the Guilt and Domini|on of Sin? Are your <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of Deliverance more <HI>earne&s;t,</HI> your <HI>Prayers</HI> more <HI>importunate</HI> and your <HI>Endeavours</HI> more <HI>animated?</HI> Do you really appear to your &s;elves more like <HI>Men in Earne&s;t</HI> in this great and important Concern? Or, if you &s;uppo&s;e your &s;elves delivered from the Guilt and Power of Sin; Do you find your&s;elves growing in an habitual Con|formity to the moral Perfections of GOD? Do you find that in&s;tead of being <HI>conformed to this World,</HI> you are <HI>transformed by the Removing of your Minds,</HI> &s;o as to <HI>approve</HI> and obey <HI>the good and acceptable and perfect Will of God?</HI> Do you really think that your Souls are more mortified to Sin, more ab|&s;tracted from the World, and the Vanities and Follies of it, and more attemper'd to the Services and Enjoyments of Heaven?</P>
<P>It requires <HI>evident</HI> and very <HI>great Effects</HI> of this Kind in your &s;elves, and in the Country in general, to excu&s;e your Conduct; for if you and your Families and Neighbours are <HI>no better,</HI> or <HI>but a little better</HI> than you and they might have been, if there had been no <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> Separation in the Coun|try; there is nothing to ballance the bad Effects of that Se|paration. You mu&s;t, I think, he now &s;en&s;ible that your &s;eparating from us, has been the <HI>great Means</HI> of preventing the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, and the Enlargement of the vi&s;ible Kingdom of the Redeemer; as it is the <HI>very Thing</HI> which has diverted to another U&s;e the Money given with that De&s;ign. And can you, without the mo&s;t punged Grief and Sorrow, reflect upon it, That you have been the Means
<PB N="137" REF="006158_0136_1027FA18757D9698">of preventing that <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> which was promi&s;ed the REDEEMER, in Con&s;ideration of his &s;hedding his precious Blood for Sinners&mdash;; That you have <HI>prevented,</HI> as much as in you lay, the <HI>beneficent De&s;igns of divine Grace</HI> toward the Heathen World&mdash;And that probably there are many immortal Souls now in Hell, who (had you contented|ly remained in our Communion) might have &s;pent an hap|py Eternity in Heaven! If neither the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Glory of</HI> GOD and <HI>Honour of the</HI> REDEEMER, nor of the <HI>eternal Intere&s;ts</HI> of your Fellow-men will influence you; you mu&s;t not only be Strangers to that exalted and <HI>Godlike Temper</HI> the Go&s;pel is de&s;igned to produce in human Minds, but mu&s;t have ca&s;t off all the <HI>tender Principles</HI> of Humanity it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But, <HI>my Brethren, I hope better Things of you.</HI> The&s;e Ar|guments were never, that I know of, &s;et in their <HI>proper Light</HI> before your Eyes. And I charitably believe, that many of you would never, <HI>on any Con&s;ideration,</HI> have acted as you have done, if you had con&s;idered Matters <HI>in this View,</HI> or had the Con&s;equences of your Conduct &s;et in &s;uch a Light before you. Surely you would not have di&s;&s;olved the Union and broken the Peace of our Churches, if you had been &s;en&s;ible that you thereby contracted the dreadful Guilt of Schi&s;m. You would not have gone into the <HI>epi&s;copal Separation,</HI> had you been aware of the many <HI>hurtful Con&s;equences</HI> of it with Regard to the <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> Intere&s;ts of your Country, and to the Cau&s;e of <HI>practical Religion</HI> in it. I cannot believe, with Regard to many of you, that you would ever have join|ed in <HI>Petitioning</HI> the Society for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or in recei|ving A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, if you had known that e|very Penny they applied to your U&s;e, was &s;o much lo&s;t to the common Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, and prevented the Propagation of the Go&s;pel of GOD YOUR SAVI|OUR.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="006158_0137_1027FA1A11956F30">
But as the&s;e Things have been now &s;et in a plain and (I think) convincing Manner before you; it may ju&s;tly be expected of you, that you approve your &s;elves <HI>Lovers of the Glory of the</HI> REDEEMER, and of the Souls of Men, by for&s;aking the criminal Separation you have run into, and returning to the Communion you have unju&s;tly for&s;aken. Thus will an End be put to the Schi&s;m you have made in this Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, and the unhappy Effects of it on practical Religion be prevented. <HI>New-England</HI> will hopefully remain a Country remarka|ble for &s;erious and practical Religion.

By this Means tho&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> which are &s;unk or &s;inking into <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>Infidelity,</HI> may be recovered to a &s;erious Sen&s;e of Reli|gion, and to &s;uch a Behaviour as &s;hall be ornamental to the Profe&s;&s;ion of it.

<P>The&s;e are Events &s;o excellent and de&s;ireable, that we ought to be ready even to lay down our Lives to for|ward and advance them.
