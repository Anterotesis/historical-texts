<HEAD>A Plea for Literature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has generally been received that republics cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t but upon the ba&s;is of virtue. If by this it is meant that &s;uch governments cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a certain portion of virtue it is true with re&s;pect to tho&s;e and all others too, and all &s;ocieties of men: when virtue &s;hall expire on earth then mu&s;t &s;ucceed that &s;cene of horrors pre&s;ented by the dramatic poet;
<Q><L>"Let order die,</L>
<L>"And let this world no longer be a &s;tage</L>
<L>"To feed contention in a ling'ring act,</L>
<L>"But let one &s;pirit of the fir&s;t-born Cain</L>
<L>"Reign in all bo&s;oms, that each heart being &s;et</L>
<L>"On bloody cour&s;es the rude &s;cene may end,</L>
<L>"And darkne&s;s be the burier of the dead!"</L></Q>
<PB N="2" REF="025162_0004_0FCE8C06E43EBF60">But if the purport of the po&s;ition be this, that of the pillars which &s;upport the fabric of government virtue is the chief, it &s;eems to be far di&s;tant from the truth. The &s;ecurity of a form of government will be found in it&s;elf or no where. So powerfully is the heart of man di&s;po&s;ed to its own gratifications, that though little virtue is to be found it would not have been &s;urpri&s;ing if pa&s;&s;ion had made that little le&s;s: and it happens fortunately that a moderate portion of virtue in the citizens is &s;ufficient to the exi&s;tence of a free government: but it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation to render this portion of virtue as active as po&s;&s;ible and as much as may be to place the common weal out of the gra&s;p of vice by removing temptations to ill, and con|verting duty into intere&s;t. The pro&s;perity of every &s;tate will doubtle&s;s ever be, caeteris paribus, proportionate to the &s;tock of virtue within it&s;elf; it is therefore al&s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation to increa&s;e the &s;tock of virtue. To this object a well con&s;tructed republic is favourable in the extreme. The vices of &s;ome men and the mi&s;cries of others come u&s;ually from the wants of all: but freedom encourages indu&s;try and plenty, more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e happy regions wherein the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life are obtained with ea&s;e: and the&s;e cau&s;es put a check upon the devices of fraud and rapine: nor do partial in&s;tances to the contrary invalidate the principle, for were the wants greater &s;o would be the crimes. The influence of one private virtue in generating another is well known to men of ob&s;ervation; the habit of doing well is formed, and in this, as in all other in&s;tances, habit induces faci|lity.
<PB N="3" REF="025162_0005_0FCE8C0855033DF0">The private character being well e&s;tabli&s;hed the public, where there is no contagion of example, a&s;&s;imi|lates without an effort. Such governments too prepare honors or rewards for faithful &s;ervants, and neglect if not infamy for the faithle&s;s. In republics men are linked together for their mutual &s;upport, for the advancement of the common intere&s;t, and not, as in monarchies and ari&s;|tocracies, &s;ervilely employed in exalting haughty thankle&s;s de&s;pots upon their pro&s;trate dignities. They are &s;ome|times the framers, &s;ometimes the admini&s;trators, &s;ome|times the &s;ervants, but always the &s;ource of law. This intimate connexion with the government endears it to the people; all love what ble&s;&s;es all; and, as the hi&s;to|ries of &s;uch &s;tates relate, they become willing, and &s;ome|times eager, to exhau&s;t property, health and life, in defence of what they love. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive deputations of the favourites of the people for the tran&s;action of pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s, train up in the &s;tate, in a cour&s;e of di&s;cipline generous and divine, a body of men devoted to the &s;er|vice and protection of the human race. The&s;e effects, &s;o far as they regard the public, have already di&s;covered them&s;elves in the regenerate government of France, in unanimity, firmne&s;s and magnanimity, entirely without example. The changes in the private character, being una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the fervour which in&s;pires a public cau&s;e, mu&s;t await a later hour; yet even the&s;e changes may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be at no great di&s;tance, &s;ince we have &s;een the thoughtle&s;s, frivolous, Pari&s;ian trifler, whom de&s;po|ti&s;m had degraded, &s;uddenly re&s;tored, as by Ithuriel's
<PB N="4" REF="025162_0006_0FCE8C0CACAB8C00">&s;pear, to the nobler character of his nature, the manly, &s;teady, prudent, citizen of France. The manners of this reformed nation may indeed be expected to lo&s;e &s;omething of that &s;oftne&s;s which is impo&s;ed on &s;laves; they will be le&s;s pliant and in&s;inuating, but their new found independence will make them more hone&s;t and &s;incere. No longer can man trample on man with im|punity: unrea&s;onable, arrogant preten&s;ions on the one part, ba&s;e compliances and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions on the other, will be bani&s;hed for ever from among them. Fearle&s;s of the hand of power the men will become noble and the wo|men cha&s;te. They will feel a dignity in their plea&s;ures and in their &s;ufferings. Maecenas, at the right hand of a tyrant who might at plea&s;ure lay him pro&s;trate in the du&s;t, felt not that noble pride of heart which is the glory of a French freeman who&s;e joys no man pre&s;umes to interrupt, who&s;e &s;orrows no man dares to in&s;ult. It was ob&s;erved above that one virtue is the offspring of another; between vices there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts the &s;ame relation; let a man be degraded in one particular, (and can ought degrade him more than lo&s;s of freedom?) from that hour his characteri&s;tics &s;hall &s;ink together. While a free govern|ment gives licence to the mind to range unfettered through the field of truth, to enjoy at will the fea&s;t of rea&s;on and of virtue, &s;he will gra&s;p eagerly at objects worthy of her nature, &s;he will a&s;&s;ert her divine original. But the head which bows beneath a ma&s;ter's yoke &s;trives even to forget the purpo&s;es of its creation, and &s;eeks in fictitious honor, tawdry gewgaws, unmanly occupations,
<PB N="5" REF="025162_0007_0FCE8C0D96ACEE80">or guilty joys, the poor &s;ub&s;titutes for unta&s;ted happine&s;s; the moral faculty of man thus &s;uffers a temporary &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion, a curele&s;s &s;hock, or utter extinction. With what horror do the patriot freedmen of France look back upon tho&s;e acts of valor which &s;uch gallant &s;pirits, mi&s;guided by the demon of de&s;poti&s;m, were ever ready to achieve again&s;t an unoffending people? How do the&s;e heroes, enoble as they are in the &s;ervice of their country and humanity, &s;hudder at the melancholy retro&s;pect of youth, beauty, gaiety and innocence, immured in a loath&s;ome cloi&s;ter to furni&s;h the trappings of ari&s;tocratic in&s;olence? How many fathers re&s;tored as they are to the charities of nature, weep now with angui&s;h over the a&s;hes of daughters doomed in an evil hour, like the wor&s;t of criminals, to perpetual impri&s;onment? How willingly would they pay the wealth of worlds to recall them from their dreary graves, whither, perhaps, they had been untimely &s;ent by moping melancholy, could they but purcha&s;e an opportunity to expiate the crime by a life of love and beneficence? Surely no government is to be approved which corrupts the morals of its citizens, even though it &s;hould promote their happine&s;s, (which, however, can|not be its effect;) the government &s;hould be &s;o formed as to render the citizens virtuous, or they do not de&s;erve to be happy. The flattering encouragement given to loyalty, as the darling virtue of monarchies, induces the neglect, often the de&s;truction, of many others, and an alacrity in obedience, indi&s;criminate, mean, flagitious. The immediate &s;ervants of the monarch are perpetually
<PB N="6" REF="025162_0008_0FCE8C12917FD7D8">employed in rivetting fa&s;ter the galling chain upon the hands of their fellow va&s;&s;als; in tearing their &s;canty covering from their backs, and &s;natching the hard|earned mor&s;el from their mouths: And it &s;urely is not matter of &s;urpri&s;e, if the&s;e plundered de&s;perate wretches prepare to make them&s;elves amends by every artifice which want and fraud can &s;ugge&s;t. Indeed &s;uch govern|ments cannot act but by the mo&s;t infamous principles and in&s;truments; and let us not wonder when the body of the people is found to be influenced by the example of &s;uperiors. Republics, on the contrary, cannot tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s with vigor without the agency of hone&s;t men; and the citizens cannot choo&s;e but love, in the per&s;ons of rulers appointed by them&s;elves, that virtue which is their be&s;t &s;ecurity. The&s;e legi&s;lators in their turn will naturally applaud virtue as the mo&s;t effectual mean by which to accompli&s;h with facility the be&s;t de|&s;igns. Thus does the very form of a good government place virtue under the immediate protection of the peo|ple, whether in command or in obedience. Even in England, the be&s;t contrived e&s;tabli&s;hment on earth, ex|cepting tho&s;e of America and France, the power in the hands of the monarch and his means of &s;eduction are &s;o exorbitant, that the &s;tate machine is kept in motion entirely by corruption: And by no other means can it be made to move, until a revolution &s;hall take place or a patriot king &s;hall fill the throne and employ his influ|ence over the other branches of the legi&s;lature, not to oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects but to reform the repre&s;entation:
<PB N="7" REF="025162_0009_0FCE8C146BE486C8">for while a majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hall continue to be appointed by five thou&s;and men, it will be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to bribe the electors; and this will be done by political pro&s;titutes, who purcha&s;e &s;eats in Par|liament, to form the oppo&s;ition which clogs the wheels of government, until they in their turn &s;hall be bribed to acquie&s;cence. How dete&s;table a &s;y&s;tem of policy mu&s;t that be which &s;tands in need of corruption for its &s;upport! and how dangerous to the morals of the peo|ple to whom it is admini&s;tered! what then mu&s;t be the character and influence of other &s;tates which &s;tand even far below this in the &s;cale of de&s;poti&s;m? Yet has the one enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers, and &s;ome of the re&s;t, as the republic of Venice and the late French monarchy, at lea&s;t warm advocates. <HI>(a)</HI></P>
<P>IT has been a matter of enquiry among &s;ome eminent and curious men, whether democracies or other govern|ments have been found mo&s;t favorable to the intere&s;ts of literature; but it is not to my purpo&s;e to dwell upon the que&s;tion of &s;uperiority in what has gone before, whether as it regards happine&s;s, virtue or literature; be|cau&s;e all governments upon record, prior to tho&s;e of America and France, have been defective in e&s;&s;entials: even the boa&s;ted con&s;titution of England, as finally e&s;|tabli&s;hed by the boa&s;ted revolution of 1689, contained in it&s;elf the principles of a rapid di&s;&s;olution; or rather inada|quate repre&s;entation was the curele&s;s di&s;temper, the can|cer, which, though it &s;hould not di&s;&s;olve the frame,
<PB N="8" REF="025162_0010_0FCE8C15E1BD19A8">could not fail to deprive it, as it has done, of the vital &s;pirit; and it now remains the lifele&s;s mummy of a government. <HI>(b)</HI> The&s;e pages will be read, if they be read at all, by men who feel that the con&s;titution of their country is good becau&s;e they are happy under it; be|cau&s;e they have too much generous pride to be happy under any in&s;titution, the officers of which could oppre&s;s and plunder them with impunity; becau&s;e the form of their's is favorable to virtue, the be&s;t pre&s;erver of the peace of &s;ociety; and becau&s;e they find them&s;elves at liberty at all times to correct errors, to redre&s;s grievances, and to improve advantages. With all the&s;e benefits in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it would little affect &s;uch a people to tell them that le&s;s happy and le&s;s virtuous nations have been wi&s;er; this would little di&s;turb them in the enjoyment of ble&s;&s;ings which are ine&s;timable, and incline them not at all to barter them for qualities which have little compara|tive value without. But let them be per&s;uaded that their government may ea&s;ily be rendered e&s;&s;entially conducive to the pro&s;perity of literature, a new attainment not only innocent but friendly to the re&s;t; that thereby they &s;hall become wi&s;er, more virtuous, and more happy, and we cannot doubt that they will e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of wi&s;dom, virtue, happine&s;s&mdash;in &s;hort, their own.</P>
<P>AMERICA has long been an object of curio&s;ity and wonder, to the enlightened characters of Europe, on ac|count of the mighty work &s;he boldly attempted, firmly labored, and ably accompli&s;hed. The great council of
<PB N="9" REF="025162_0011_0FCE8C175BC9A9A8">the greate&s;t nation of the world, with a magnanimity which &s;hewed them to be qualified for the noble&s;t achieve|ments, have acknowledged the legi&s;lators of this infant empire as their ma&s;ters in the high bu&s;ine&s;s of civil policy. Even 'mid&s;t the clamors of civil commotion, 'mid&s;t the din of war, the voice of eloquence was heard, and the pen was employed as &s;kilfully as the &s;word. It mu&s;t therefore occa&s;ion &s;urpri&s;e in &s;uch parts of the learned world as are unacquainted with the peculiar cir|cum&s;tances of this continent, that &s;o few productions of merit, and indeed &s;o few of any de&s;cription, have i&s;&s;u|ed from the American pre&s;s &s;ince the time when the di&s;appointment of the Briti&s;h arms &s;eemed to leave the citizens at lei&s;ure for literary occupations. The &s;ervice of the mu&s;es is in all countries, at this day, extremely uprofitable, and when a competency has been obtain|ed therein, it was &s;poken of as an in&s;tance of extraor|dinary felicity. Yet where, as in the old countries, the departments of government are filled with men of family, tho&s;e of law, phy&s;ic and divinity crouded with profe&s;&s;ors, and the monopoly of property in mo&s;t in|&s;tances forbids any advancement by means of agricul|ture or commerce, literature mu&s;t often become the la&s;t re&s;ort of indigent genius. But in America, the offices of government are open to merit; and proper|ty being more equally divided and much more ea&s;ily obtained, tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, apply them&s;elves to its improvement, tho&s;e who do not, to the attainment thereof; &s;o that the whole community is too active to
<PB N="10" REF="025162_0012_0FCE8C1AB78E9090">&s;peculate, except it be immediately in aid of action: tho&s;e who &s;tand in need of gain can obtain little by writing books, and tho&s;e who do not, are u&s;ually ei|ther engaged in the &s;ervice of government, or &s;ome too indolent, others too ignorant to write. Moreover, the number of per&s;ons in America who can afford to pay the price of books, is not yet &s;ufficiently large to re|ward the labors of writers who might prove eminently in&s;tructive and u&s;eful: for even if their object be re|putation or the good of human nature, and they &s;hould be content to find the bulk of their readers in Europe, there are many &s;ubjects to which a man might wi&s;h to apply his &s;tudies, which local circum&s;tances would render little intere&s;ting to foreigners; be&s;ides, that few writers can afford to &s;light the emoluments of literature, of which, if his book were printed in Ame|rica he would be deprived by foreign book&s;ellers who would re-print, or by American if printed abroad. Private patronage too, which has &s;ometimes produced &s;alutary effects, cannot at pre&s;ent be expected on this continent: this will rather be found, when found at all, in countries the governments and habits of which (contrarily to ours) encourage the monopoly of large e&s;tates, which occa&s;ionally prove fountains of liberality, and &s;treams of Helicon too, to the learned. Be&s;ides, when a &s;tate by its arbitrary character forbids even its foremo&s;t citizens to &s;truggle for authority, they are left at full lei&s;ure to admire and fo&s;ter men of talents.&mdash; Under the old e&s;tabli&s;hment of France, more patron|age
<PB N="11" REF="025162_0013_0FCE8C1D570AA6B0">was enjoyed than in the free kingdom of Great-Britain. Even in Great-Britain, good writers have of|ten found favor with the great and been promoted to important and lucrative employments, in con&s;ideration of their literary talents, as in the in&s;tances of Newton, Locke, Addi&s;on, Prior, Congreve, and others; and this too without any regard to the peculiar characters of their minds, an example which is not likely, and evidently ought not, to be imitated here. The rich ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical benefices of Europe too, though u&s;ually be|&s;towed upon illu&s;trious dunces, have &s;ometimes excited, and rewarded, the ambition of eminent genius; and in like manner &s;inecures and pen&s;ions. Perhaps too, the characteri&s;tic mode&s;ty of the American nation, &s;o often to be found in its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, forms another impediment to the efforts of the learned; and tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to the in&s;olence of European greatne&s;s, mu&s;t ob&s;erve with wonder, that the mo&s;t dignified is the mo&s;t mode&s;t citizen of the United States. Add to all this, that our government has not yet been twenty years in exi&s;tence; for I pa&s;s over the time when in its colonial capacity it felt the controlling hand of Britain, like a wayward child; knowing neither the occa&s;ions, nor the motives, nor the &s;pirit of great de&s;igns. Since then all things
<Q>"Creep in a &s;tealing pace"</Q>
toward perfection, little even of that which has been effected where attempts were made, in war and legi&s;la|tion, could in &s;o &s;hort a time have been rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="025162_0014_0FCE8C1E557B9688">
THESE are &s;ome of the cau&s;es, peculiar to America, which operate as di&s;couragements from literary achieve|ments; by the&s;e is &s;he depre&s;&s;ed in addition to the weight of others common to other countries, which will incidentally come under ob&s;ervation as we proceed.</P>
<P>GREAT as the impediments in the way of genius appear, the mo&s;t zealous friend to literature need not be di&s;mayed at the pro&s;pect, when he reflects that the power to remove them and to put allurements in their place, is lodged in the hands of tho&s;e, who&s;e honor and intere&s;ts mu&s;t prompt them to their duty. <HI>(c)</HI> To the re&s;pect and &s;upport rendered to learned men in the courts of Augu&s;tus and queen Ann, may per|haps be a&s;cribed the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e literary con&s;tella|tions which throw a glory round them; and it is remarkable that the prizes offered to dramatic writers by the Athenians, were contended for by Oe&s;chylus, So|phocles, and Euripides at the &s;ame time. A con&s;tella|tion is more admired and gazed at than a &s;ingle &s;tar; the general blaze graces the peculiar &s;plendor. This is known to men of uncommon talents, and they are tempted forth to &s;hare the honors confered by the fa&s;hi|on of the time. Rewards, as well lucrative as hono|rary cannot &s;urely be too &s;oon, nor more worthily, be|&s;towed than upon di&s;tingui&s;hed genius, employed in the in&s;truction and embelli&s;hment of the human mind; in the &s;ervice of human nature. Even in this early &s;tage of her advancement, America po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es re&s;ources capa|ble
<PB N="13" REF="025162_0015_0FCE8C1F970EADF0">of furni&s;hing, without empoveri&s;hment, no contempt|ible emolument to the learned; more e&s;pecially as her ad|vancement will be accelerated by the expence. But as &s;oon as the debt of the nation &s;hall have been di&s;charged, then will the &s;imple frugal plan of polity which &s;ecures its intere&s;ts at home, and its di&s;tance from every formidable power which &s;upercedes the nece&s;&s;ity of expen&s;ive milita|ry e&s;tabli&s;hments for the repul&s;ion of an invader, concur to ama&s;s trea&s;ures inexhau&s;tible. So &s;mall a number as forty-eight eccle&s;ia&s;tical drones in England and Ireland, an|nually con&s;ume no le&s;s than one hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling, in fea&s;ting for the good of the &s;ouls of the laity, a &s;um which bears a con&s;iderable propor|tion to the whole of the American civil li&s;t: and the public debt of America amounts not in its principal to &s;o much as the intere&s;t of that of Great Britain; even this may perhaps be extingui&s;hed in a moderate &s;pace of time by the &s;ale of vacant lands. From abroad no dangers &s;eem to threaten; a rupture with the Spaniards would but involve them in difficulties; de&s;pots have learnt to trem|ble at the frown of liberty, and the &s;pirit of di&s;obedience has animated even the blood-hounds which were wont at their command to bathe them&s;elves in human gore. The re&s;entment of a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the materials of naval armaments, being once incurred, the interception of the trea&s;ures of South America, the &s;inews of the Spani&s;h power, might probably en&s;ue; which lo&s;&s;es would more-debilitate the parent &s;tate than the di&s;memberment of the colonies did Great Britain. Spain, with her mines,
<PB N="14" REF="025162_0016_0FCE8C225A8565F0">is feeble; without her mines and without indu&s;try, &s;he mu&s;t peri&s;h. It appears then, that we, le&s;s than any other nation &s;tand in need of armies, which are at all times expen&s;ive, and &s;ometimes dangerous to the &s;tate; in which particular we &s;hall perhaps prove more fortunate than the gallant French, &s;urrounded as they are by mar|tial neighbours, the rival&s;hip among whom has brought into the field in modern times, under the command of a king of France, a &s;tronger force than was employed by a Roman emperor to keep the &s;ubject world in awe; yet was this France but a Province of the empire. A|merica can better do without an army even than Great-Britain, notwith&s;tanding her in&s;ular &s;ituation and her powerful navy.

<P>THE plan of propo&s;ing &s;pecific the&s;es to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the learned, which has been adopted by &s;ome private &s;ocieties, would certainly, as a national concern, and under proper modifications as &s;uch, be rendered produc|tive of the mo&s;t important benefits to the community. Many excellent and u&s;eful works would come directly from the in&s;titution; and the cau&s;e of truth would in|directly pro&s;per by the general principle of literary e|mulation, which would animate the wi&s;dom of the na|tion; all could not be &s;ucce&s;sful, but immediate efforts, or preparatory &s;tudies in tho&s;e who &s;hould not &s;ucceed or who &s;hould ultimately decline &s;uch conte&s;ts, would doubt|le&s;s, in many in&s;tances, light genius into a flame which otherwi&s;e, like &s;parks in flint, had lain for ever dormant.

So flouri&s;hed Rome under the admini&s;tration of Augu&s;tus and the Antonines, and France under the admini&s;tration of Lewis XIVth, the pa|tron, though but the ape, of wi&s;dom. But monarchs while they gave countenance to literary men, have ever &s;triven to point their attention as wide as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e objects which mo&s;t immediately concerned the felicity of the people; to them has been u&s;ually allowed ju&s;t, light enough to di&s;cern the means of exalting the empire and the tyrant, but &s;eldom &s;o much as might be &s;ufficient to exalt the empire and the nation. It has ever been the purpo&s;e of princes to keep their &s;ubjects below the digni|ty of human nature; wi&s;e they might e&s;teem, noble they might a&s;pire at, freedom: &s;o that kings and kingdoms were made illu&s;trious by the labour and valour of tho&s;e hands which &s;till remained in chains.

Legi&s;lation becomes in this in&s;tance the tender office of a parent providing for the welfare of his children; when in&s;truction has been given, the in&s;tructor feels him&s;elf exalted by the honors which his pupil gains; the &s;hines with reflected light; and the legi&s;lator, when he &s;hall re|turn into the cla&s;s of ordinary citizens, will glow with hone&s;t pride in contemplating in his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the faculties improved, the wi&s;dom created, by him&s;elf, which &s;hall then have become nece&s;&s;ary to his own &s;ecurity and con|tentment in his humbler &s;phere. In &s;uch a government, the greatne&s;s of the &s;tate, the glory of the rulers, and the happine&s;s of the people, are all in&s;eparably blended.

The re&s;traints which the lu&s;t of dominion does u&s;ually throw upon the efforts of the learned, have accordingly often benumbed or &s;o|phi&s;ticated, the intellects of man in a manner unknown in the hi&s;tories of free civilized governments, though defective in their form; and, when the intellects e&s;cape this influence, the moral faculty, as ob&s;erved above, &s;uf|fers the rude&s;t &s;hocks.

<P>As nothing but learning can en&s;ure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of li|berty, &s;o al&s;o can liberty be defended from the mischiefs of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as a pretended friend the mo&s;t dange|rous of enemies, by nothing but learning. The true enlightened republican or lover of the public weal, is equally friendly to liberty and abhorrent to licentiou&s;|ne&s;s: in an ignorant multitude, the feeling differs; the evils which come from the intemperate u&s;e of the great|e&s;t good, are overlooked by the&s;e, or when fore&s;een, are too often di&s;regarded. In arbitrary governments, the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;tance of licentiou&s;ne&s;s incurs infamy or puni&s;hment, and the&s;e are u&s;ually proportionate to the barbari&s;m of the people; but in free &s;tates it is treated with indulgence, as "an excre&s;cence on the eye of li|berty, which &s;hould be touched with a gentle, with a trembling hand, le&s;t we injure the eye, le&s;t we injure the body upon which it is apt to appear." The envy which follows wealth, is in &s;ome in&s;tances an incitement to jealou&s;y, hate, and di&s;order; in others, it is a &s;lavi&s;h

Wealth, on the contrary, mere unqualified wealth, but helps to &s;ap the ba&s;is of government by promoting luxury, and, where it is practicable, by inviting inva&s;ion. In the re|volution war, the Briti&s;h arms &s;uffered the mo&s;t formida|ble cheecks from the citizens of the &s;tates which were lea&s;t wealthy, and, perhaps, be&s;t informed: they were accord|ingly di&s;tingui&s;hed in England, as <HI>the ne&s;t of hornets;</HI> &s;he learnt indeed to rue their &s;tings, and to her did Bo&s;ton become a term of di&s;may, as Carthage formerly to Rome.

By means of literature and virtue, will the ble&s;&s;ings of order and good government, among others, be be&s;t under&s;tood, va|lued, and pre&s;erved. In de&s;potic &s;tates, the &s;ame power which bends the neck to the yoke, can, by its dependent

But in free &s;ocieties, wherein each man is the carver of his own fortunes and needs &s;mall aid from others, the citizens are much in danger of pa&s;&s;ing from independence to ferocity in public concerns, and from &s;incerity to rudene&s;s in private.

In the Engli&s;h government, there is oppre&s;&s;ion enough to excite indignation, and liberty enough to ad|mit of complaint and other con&s;equences of ill humour; two cau&s;es, which may very well be &s;uppo&s;ed to forbid &s;oftne&s;s and &s;uavity of deportment, and to mar the quali|ty of literary accompli&s;hments which they po&s;&s;e&s;s.

In defect of this attainment, the Turki&s;h grandee is con&s;trained to fill the &s;ad vacuity of ignorance with opium, coffee, and tobac|co; the American &s;avage with intoxicating liquors.

<P>IN the encouragement of learning, the preference, beyond que&s;tion, is due to tho&s;e branches thereof, which mini&s;ter mo&s;t immediately to the public good; but &s;o precious is human wit, that no &s;pecies is without its va|lue; and of tho&s;e which are in lea&s;t e&s;teem for utility, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;peak.

Such is the affinity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the various departments of &s;cience, that no one can be pro|nounced incapable of &s;uccouring another. Many modern improvements in anatomy have been derived from the optician; by him al&s;o, has the a&s;tronomer been furni&s;hed with in&s;truments; and the a&s;tronomer, in his turn, gives help to navigators. It may be in the power of a chymi&s;t to throw &s;uch lights upon the art of hu&s;bandry, as may double the revenues of a &s;tate. Botany may afford aids to the practice of phy&s;ic, which may re&s;cue millions from the grave, the &s;alvation of only one of whom would have won the Roman civic crown: the ble&s;&s;ings which have been &s;howered upon the human race by the di&s;covery of the Peruvian bark alone do indeed &s;tand beyond the reach of calculation. To the &s;tudy of bota|ny will many ingenious men be incited by the magic of poetic numbers in <HI>the Botanic Garden,</HI> and the poem it&s;elf is the offspring of the botanic art. A general pa&s;|&s;ion for literature, perhaps, formed in Dr. Franklin that habit of enquiry which led him to the &s;tudy of politics; and his literary powers may have procured him that favor among the great in France which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree, and may have qualified him for the negociation which freed his country. <HI>(e)</HI> Polite literature, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no direct powers which can devi&s;e a &s;cheme of &s;tate, yet can pro&s;per what has been devi&s;ed, and &s;ave a &s;inking land. The late lord Chatham was

Virtue mu&s;t not only be known, but recom|mended; and the di&s;tinction between the charms of truth, attired in homely ve&s;tments, or graced in all the ornaments of rhetoric and poetry, fails not to &s;trike the eye of an ordinary beholder; but to a man of ta&s;te, is intere&s;ting in the extreme. In the performances of the black&s;mith and the &s;teel worker, the hou&s;e painter and the hi&s;tory painter, the metal and the paint are the mate|rials in either ca&s;e; but the &s;kill with which they are handled, determines the character of the labourer or the arti&s;t.

It is ea&s;y to convince a man that certain modes of con|duct are commendable, but to go further and per&s;uade him to adopt them, this is the achievement of a ma&s;ter. The Athenians needed no in&s;tructor to acquaint them it was their duty, in&s;tead of wa&s;ting their time at public &s;hews, to ru&s;h forth in defence of the liberty of their country, again&s;t the encroachments of Philip; this they had known before; but it demanded the powers of Demo&s;thenes to impel them to the field. This in&s;tance
<PB N="26" REF="025162_0028_0FCE8C3A99324D58">of the u&s;e of elocution, is the more remarkable, as the orator incited others to acts of valor, to which he was proved him&s;elf unequal: the Athenian army obtained the honors of the field, while the man of eloquence pre|cipitately fled. In the art of per&s;ua&s;ion there is this ad|vantage too, that while it can extingui&s;h vice and confirm virtue, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no injurious influence over the actions of the good. When human nature is found in a &s;tate of innocence and felicity, as in the in&s;tance of the ami|able inhabitants of Pelew, and if, in a &s;tate of igno|rance, any &s;ecurity in the&s;e advantages could be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it might perhaps afflict the warme&s;t friend of learning to &s;ee arts intruded upon peace, creating wants fa&s;ter than they can be gratified, and kindling pa&s;&s;ions which will need new arts to mitigate their rage. But in an ad|vanced &s;tage of &s;ociety, when the objects of pride, ava|rice, envy, jealou&s;y, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, have been al|ready introduced, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to admini&s;ter &s;uit|able remedies to the&s;e inveterate maladies. The polite e&s;&s;ays of Addi&s;on and Steele, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been happily in&s;trumental in meliorating, at lea&s;t the manners, or what are called by the French, <HI>la petit morale,</HI> of the people of England: and when we reflect on the &s;alutary influences of gentle amiable demeanor in &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e, this will be admitted as no incon&s;iderable in&s;tance of the benefit of fine writing. If to that nation, as has been hinted above, the aids of literary accompli&s;hments be peculiarly requi&s;ite on account of the per&s;onal free|dom it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and if there be al&s;o an indi&s;pen&s;ible ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="27" REF="025162_0029_0FCE8C3D2B3C40A8">for the&s;e aids in our freer and more popular go|vernment, wherein the citizens are &s;o much at liberty to indulge tho&s;e licentious a&s;perities which mar their mu|tual peace; &s;o al&s;o will the &s;ucce&s;s of the application bear a proportion to the character of the literature ad|mini&s;tered. Philo&s;ophy will &s;trengthen, but wit, elo|quence, poetry, mu&s;t refine; as the highe&s;t poli&s;h comes from the &s;moothe&s;t or the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ub&s;tances. Even the philo&s;opher or politician, therefore, if he be the father of the people and make provi&s;ion for the &s;ecurity of their happine&s;s, will not he&s;itate to become the patron of the fine arts.

The efficacy of &s;uch magic in pre&s;erving a manly national character &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of freedom, was &s;o well known to a king of England, the invader of the gallant Wel&s;h, that the royal &s;avage ordered all their bards to be put to death, to facilitate the conque&s;t of the country. Among the ancient Germans too, the influ|ence of poetic tran&s;ports, in generating a martial &s;pi|rit, was often employed; and there are &s;pecific victo|ries on record, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been won by poe|try. A modern politican has a&s;cribed very power|ful effects to the popular &s;ongs of later times: Perhaps the Engli&s;h have been indebted to the military &s;ong of <HI>Hearts of Oak,</HI> for &s;ome of their naval victories, and we know the &ccedil;a ira of the French to be their Io Poean. The national &s;ongs of North-Britain thrill through the veins of every Scot; and &s;ome martial Caledonian &s;train will &s;hortly pierce a Brun&s;wick's ear like witching incan|tations. <HI>(g)</HI> A correct ta&s;te a&s;ks poems in "an higher mood."

The morals of the two great epic poems of antiquity, are bad in e&s;&s;entials, and took their com|plexions from the licentious manners of the ages in which they were compo&s;ed. In Homer's time, predatory expe|ditions, or what we &s;hould term piracies, &s;eem (and they are &s;poken of by him without blame,) to have been re|garded as a reputable occupation. It is no wonder then that the carrying fire and &s;word into the country of an un|offending people to recover a royal &s;trumpet &s;hould, in compari&s;on with an ordinary robbery, be applauded as an heroic exploit; more e&s;pecially as &s;he was the wife of one of tho&s;e confederating monarchs, who came into the world for no other purpo&s;e than to tread upon the necks of &s;uch dutiful warriors. It is well known too that, among the Romans, the conquerors and butchers of innocent nations were held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem as the mo&s;t virtuous characters alive; and that too in ca&s;es wherein not even their tyrant had given offence (who&s;e guilt however &s;hould in no ca&s;e have been avenged in the per&s;ons of his &s;ubjects;) it was very natural there|fore that Latinus's breach of promi&s;e when he had be|trothed his daughter &s;hould be made a &s;ufficient pretext whereby the pious Aeneas took occa&s;ion to involve a harm|le&s;s race of men in all the horrors of de&s;olation and &s;laughter. No material alteration had taken place in political philo&s;ophy when in an evil hour Alexander of Macedon came like a pe&s;tilence into the world to plague mankind. By Ari&s;totle he was taught to delight in
<PB N="30" REF="025162_0032_0FCE8C42B3237228" MS="y">Homer: unfortunately in his Achilles he delighted more and learnt from him to bathe the face of earth in human gore. It was the boa&s;t of Virgil that this was the princi|ple of his country,
<Q>Parcere &s;ubjectis &amp; debellare &s;uperbos;</Q>
which may certainly be fairly tran&s;lated thus; "to &s;pare the abject unre&s;i&s;ting wretch and put the brave to death;" or thus, "to degrade the noble mind to &s;lavery but not murder the man en&s;laved." The wor&s;t part of this hal|lowed maxim, but not always the be&s;t, ruled the wa&s;te|ful life of Alexander. Sometimes indeed he would &s;ur|pa&s;s him&s;elf and, as in the ca&s;e of Porus, he would &s;eize upon a kingdom like a robber and re&s;tore it like a hero. We on the contrary are &s;o happy as to live in an age of the world when the human mind has a&s;&s;umed in politics and morals, &s;ome moderate portion of the light of rea&s;on; enough at lea&s;t to di&s;cern that a great rogue is much more dete&s;table than a &s;mall one, as the trea&s;ures of a world exceed the value of a pur&s;e of gold, and a million of lives out number the life of an individual. No longer are the Iliad and Aeneid peru&s;ed as exemplars in moral, but in poetic, excellence;

<P>THE moral and political u&s;es of fine writing have been mentioned fir&s;t as they de&s;erve; but as a certain portion of plea&s;ure is nece&s;&s;ary to man, and that too even as an en|couragement in the di&s;charge of his duty, and as in de|fect of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which are innocent he is apt to in|dulge in the guilty, the mo&s;t rigid politician, philo&s;opher, or morali&s;t, will &s;carcely object to the propagation of po|lite &s;tudies even as &s;ources of delight. When the patriot &s;hall have done his utmo&s;t in the mo&s;t momentous de|partments of legi&s;lation, much will &s;till remain to be done
<PB N="32" REF="025162_0034_0FCE8C45E2484690">to &s;often the condition of human nature. Nor can the labour of philo&s;ophic exerci&s;es be &s;u&s;tained perpetually; the mind mu&s;t &s;eek occa&s;ional recreation in gentle elegant amu&s;ement. Rough is the path of life, tender the feet of man; it is not &s;ufficient that &s;harp flints and craggy protuberances &s;hall be broken away; but, that man may walk cheerily on his journey, &s;oft herbage mu&s;t &s;ometimes comfort his foot-&s;teps, and ro&s;es blow amid&s;t innumerable thorns. He is often compelled to &s;teal from &s;ad reality to &s;cenes of fancied bli&s;s, there to lay down awhile his load of cares, and &s;natch a &s;hort repo&s;e which like night|ly &s;leep fits him to bear a weight otherwi&s;e above his &s;trength. The &s;ad con&s;equences of melancholy appear often in debility both corporal and mental; and nothing conduces more to the &s;anity of the whole human &s;y&s;tem, the Mens &s;ana in corpore &s;ano, than cheerfulne&s;s and mirth. The productions of comic writers are therefore happily fitted for the comfort and relief of tho&s;e who&s;e need is greate&s;t. A traveller ob&s;erving a man at a di&s;tance reading a book and u&s;ing very extravagant ge&s;tures pointed him out to his companion, who replied that the book mu&s;t be Don Quixote or the man mu&s;t be mad; the former proved to be the truth. It is evident then that not only the &s;trength, but the beauty of literature al|&s;o, merits the patronage of the public even when it &s;tands alone and is viewed merely as an object of delight. Rhet|oric and poetry however we have &s;een may be employed in a direct manner for the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es; and even wit, too often deemed a plea&s;ing trifler, can &s;ome|times
<PB N="33" REF="025162_0035_0FCE8C492376A4D0">advance the be&s;t de&s;igns of virtue, policy, or phi|lo&s;ophy. Mirth, cheerfulne&s;s, and health, are followed u&s;ually by benevolence; and actions become plea&s;ures which were duties before. A joyous character is general|ly too happy in the plea&s;ing habit of his &s;oul to attempt an augmentation of his bli&s;s by a wilful injury of others; and &s;eldom but in gloomy tempers have we detected atrocious guilt. Nothing but the black horrors of flagitious bigo|try could &s;o naturally have incited Philip II. of Spain to the ma&s;&s;acre of a nation and the murder of his &s;on. The &s;ucce&s;s with which Cervantes combated the mad &s;pirit of chivalry is well known; and it is certain that to wilful pertinacious error the &s;ubtilties of philo&s;phy and the thunders of eloquence are le&s;s terrible than the &s;hafts of ridicule. As much good may be done by well directed wit, &s;o al&s;o may much mi&s;chief be prevented as the con|&s;equence of tho&s;e baleful productions which, being re|commended by all the graces of fine writing and tho&s;e flat|teries in which voluptuous pa&s;&s;ions delight, have long been, and &s;till continue, in very improper hands. In the be&s;t e&s;teemed novels publi&s;hed in &s;tates who&s;e habits and manners differ materially from ours, not unfrequently does an incon&s;tant wife &s;o pathetically bewail the guilt in which &s;he has been involved by the neglect of an hu&s;|band, probably too neither young nor hand&s;ome, that the heart becomes too much engaged in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the lovely mourner to be at lei&s;ure to condemn her crimes; and to a peice of this de&s;cription has the author prefixed this notable motto, Quibus pretium faceret ip&s;a fragilitas.

A combination of the gayer and graver faculties of the mind is moreover found not unfrequently in the &s;ame genius. In Homer were united judgment, fancy, and humour. In Shake&s;peare and Horace, judgment, fancy, wit, and humour. Every intellectual excellence de&s;erves to be rated high. The ruby is not the le&s;s a jewel becau&s;e it is not a diamond.

<P>I HAVE &s;poken above of the nece&s;&s;ity of giving per&s;onal dignity to literary characters as &s;uch, the advantage whereof appeared in a very &s;triking manner in France, before the revolution; where a Voltaire, a Rou&s;&s;eau, a Marmontel, might always a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, though not always of pecuniary advantages, at lea&s;t of &s;uch a portion of con&s;olatary re&s;pect in the capacity of literati, as would certainly have been denied to the mo&s;t opulent ob&s;cure ignorant. But I have &s;aid that in free governments the leading citizens are u&s;ually too much occupied by politi|cal engagements to devote much time to the &s;ociety of the learned; and the di&s;tribution of property through all branches of every family leaves no re&s;ources for very ef|fectual patronage. Nay even in one of tho&s;e countries which from the difference of circum&s;tances might be

In free &s;tates too the oppor|tunities of accumulating wealth and the pageantry of &s;uc|ce&s;sful men operate with great power in withdrawing the attention of the community from literature and literary men. Be&s;ides, let us &s;uppo&s;e that intellectual accompli&s;h|ments &s;hall obtain a mea&s;ure of re&s;pect as ample as is con|&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of indigence, yet will property be ever found nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>full</HI> attainment of their de&s;erts. Though wealth as &s;uch may in &s;ome ca&s;es be e&s;timated at no very high rate by a man of ab&s;tract views, yet if he be a man of the world he cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the value of that which is the only mean whereby ju&s;tice can be ex|acted in favor of qualities really re&s;pectable. Relative advantages only can give effect to the highe&s;t of tho&s;e which are per&s;onal.

This mea&s;ure has been admitted to have been cau&s;ed in a great degree by Mr. Paine's pam|phlet entitled <HI>Common Sen&s;e;</HI> yet has this indu&s;trious and di&s;intere&s;ted writer emerged from the per&s;onal ob&s;curity to which he was condemned by his fellow citizens into the favor and protection of a foreign nation. The produc|tions of genius even when they prove lucrative do not al|ways enrich the author but frequently either a book&s;eller, or at &s;ome di&s;tant period, a commentator. Milton's pro|fits from the noble&s;t poetical production in the Engli&s;h, or perhaps in any other, language, amounted to no more than thirty pounds: the time employed in the compo&s;ition of
<PB N="43" REF="025162_0045_0FCE8C5EC9F0AD80">the piece was ten years: three pounds a year then was the compen&s;ation of the labours of the greate&s;t poet upon earth, who was believed to have been employed in the &s;ervice of God and man. Sometime after this a commentary not equal in value to the ten be&s;t lines of the work, was &s;old for &s;e|veral thou&s;and pounds. But, gain who may by litera|ture, (more e&s;pecially that which is mo&s;t u&s;eful) the pub|lic are &s;ure to obtain by far the ample&s;t &s;hare either in the form of plea&s;ure or of profit. The profits of the inven|tors of the mariner's compa&s;s and quadrant would not weigh with tho&s;e of the commercial world &s;o much as a fea|ther with a mountain. Since then the &s;tate mu&s;t ever be the heir of learning it will do wi&s;ely to improve its funds. Patents for the con&s;truction of u&s;eful machines have fre|quently drawn &s;howers of gold upon their inventors; but the principles upon which they were con&s;tructed, whence were the&s;e derived? From books written by tattered, hou&s;ele&s;s, &s;tarving &s;ervants of mankind. Is it not a&s;ton|i&s;hing that the profe&s;&s;ion of literature, the only one which mini&s;ters directly to the good of the &s;tate, &s;hould by any good government be &s;uffered to remain without a recom|pence? The gates of glory admit as readily the votaries of law and phy&s;ic as the votaries of the mu&s;es: but how great the di&s;parity in pecuniary advantages?

By this too would another learned profe&s;&s;ion be pre&s;ented to the election of di&s;criminated genius.

Until the lucrative departments of bu&s;ine&s;s and genius &s;hall have been filled up can it be doubted that the niggard &s;oil of literature &s;hall be left uncultured? While men of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed talents are thus profitably employed can any hope &s;urvive that they may be removed without a lure? But in a country of &s;uch va&s;t extent and with an increa&s;ing population who &s;hall declare the time when agriculture, commerce, phy&s;ic, and law, &s;hall want employment. That &s;uch is the extent and &s;uch the population of our country is matter for animating reflection, but upon lite|rature mu&s;t it depend at la&s;t whether the character of an immen&s;e empire &s;hall be Attick or Boeotian. Nor can any apprehen&s;ion be rea&s;onably entertained le&s;t the pa|tronage of learning &s;hould crowd this department with profe&s;&s;ors.

In a government like the late French monarchy where lucrative vocations crowned not the able&s;t or the wealthie&s;t man with honor, while the learned were held in reverence, a genius found &s;ome temptation to forego ignoble gain and enter into a &s;tate of &s;plendid poverty: but in free &s;tates &s;uch pur&s;uits en|rich, promote, and dignify, the citizen; and he mu&s;t be an enthu&s;ia&s;t indeed who &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to embrace a &s;cience not highly portioned when rich and noble rivals are within his reach. Circum&s;tanced as the profe&s;&s;ion of literature is at pre&s;ent every "fool to fame" is in emi|nent danger of di&s;appointed ambition, in neglected, cheer|le&s;s, hople&s;s, poverty. Had fortune &s;miled upon the la|bors and graced the conditions of the authors of Para|di&s;e Lo&s;t, and Comus, Lear, Hamlet, Othello, and Mac|beth, is it to be imagined that the&s;e wonderful poets would have remained for a long time unnoticed by the world, and that &s;uch precious performances would have &s;tood in need of the commentaries of Addi&s;on, or the repre&s;en|tations of Garrick to proclaim their worth? How many men of di&s;tinction in the learned and the fa&s;hionable world are there to be found who would quit the &s;umptu|ous &s;cenes of luxury and pride, to &s;eek the &s;ad retreat wherein a needy un&s;ucce&s;sful humbled party man was con|&s;oling him&s;elf in the &s;tudy of poetry?

By cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;onings upon important points, &s;uch writers might often help to prepare the public mind for a final di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deci&s;ion; allaying by &s;uch means much of that di&s;putatious animo&s;ity which fir&s;t invades the peace of &s;ocial life, and, after, impedes mo&s;t perilou&s;ly the advancement of public bu&s;ine&s;s. The power of virtuous wi&s;dom in filling a &s;tate with felicity has never yet been completely di&s;played: and in free unanimous governments no dangers are to be apprehend|ed from the productions of flagitious genius; for where men are accu&s;tomed to think for them&s;elves it is as diffi|cult to per&s;uade them from their true intere&s;ts as it is to per&s;uade them thereto where others have been allowed to think for them: and this difficulty grows with the growth of di&s;&s;eminated wi&s;dom. Men of experience and ob&s;ervation will recollect in&s;tances of u&s;eful projects, which have been &s;lighted by the public becau&s;e the au|thors were ob&s;cure; and very ju&s;t complaints of this &s;ore evil are to be found in the performances of very able writers.

<PB N="49" REF="025162_0051_0FCE8C6C2AE287E8">any man takes upon him their unprofitable thankle&s;s em|ployment. But what has hitherto been the effect of chance may by &s;uitable incitements be made to proceed in future from de&s;ign; and the danger of being deprived of the contributions of the learned be proportionately dimini&s;hed. The American revolution was an accident by which the nece&s;&s;ity of the time drew forth into the &s;ervice of mankind powers which had otherwi&s;e remain|ed unknown not only to the world, but to the generals and &s;tate&s;men who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them: but &s;teady encourage|ment to literary exertions would reveal exalted charac|ters as much &s;uperior in number to tho&s;e which have been found without, as the extent of politics and war is exceeded by the ample round of &s;cience.

<P>As the public do in no other in&s;tance expect the &s;er|vices of a man of genius without a compen&s;ation, &s;o like|wi&s;e mu&s;t it be concluded that in the in&s;tance of an emi|nent writer they will not often be &s;o cheaply obtained. But this will happen not only as a natural con&s;equence of di&s;couragement, but as a con&s;equence in many ca&s;es in|evitable and utterly beyond the control of the writer him|&s;elf. Without a competency at lea&s;t it is impo&s;&s;ible for a liberal man to po&s;&s;e&s;s that peace of mind and con&s;e|quent health, that integrity of the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="50" REF="025162_0052_0FCE8C6D95C48280">to the full accompli&s;hment of literary de&s;igns. Every man is con&s;cious in his own ca&s;e and a multitude of others, that the powers of the mind &s;ink under the pre&s;&s;ure of afflictive pa&s;&s;ions or corporal &s;ufferance. De|bility is but premature old age, and the alterations in the faculties induced by the influence of time are too well known. The a&s;toni&s;hing intellect of Newton became &s;o enfeebled in the decline of life, that he was unable &s;im|ply to comprehend the my&s;teries of nature which in the vigour of his rea&s;on he had revealed: that luminary which had beamed upon the world effulgence which none but eagle's eyes could bear, lo&s;t the mild lu&s;tre of the &s;etting &s;un. Such con&s;equences of ruffled &s;pirits or debility &s;hould not &s;urpri&s;e us, &s;ince when the&s;e cau&s;es act with uncommon violence madne&s;s it&s;elf en&s;ues. We find too that the activity of the &s;oul even in youth and habitual health is often materially impaired by cau&s;es which but &s;lightly di&s;turb the body, &s;uch as a late in|&s;tance of ebriety, a hearty meal, fatigue, or exhau&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion. Nay it is not uncommon for per&s;ons who feel not even a tran&s;ient ailment to demand the aids of &s;ome external agent. Some minds obtain their utmo&s;t power, others are bereft of it, by the application of a &s;timu|lus. Horace has &s;aid

Churchill who di&s;covered &s;atiric talents worthy of the mo&s;t &s;edulous improvement, is &s;aid to have been armed by Bacchus when he a&s;&s;aulted the profligate velut en&s;e &s;tricto.

The &s;tronge&s;t and bolde&s;t conceptions of mo&s;t men per|haps have been the &s;ugge&s;tions of a powerful &s;timulus, which could augment the tone of the &s;y&s;tem to the ex|treme and exalt the man above his natural character. Of Dryden it is recorded, that he employed the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of medicine in fitting him for his literary labors. If then the mental energy admit not of the &s;lighte&s;t impedi|ments, and, where even the&s;e are not, it be found expe|dient to rai&s;e it by promoting a rapid circulation of the blood and bri&s;ker flow of &s;pirits, who &s;hall not fore&s;ee that a dejected pining child of poverty, tottering under

Beautiful as are the writings of Pope, &s;ublime as are tho&s;e of Milton, and though to improve <HI>The Rape of the Lock,</HI> or the prime beauties of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> would be to poli&s;h the &s;mooth|ne&s;s of ice, and to brighten the &s;plendor of the &s;un, yet who &s;hall &s;et bounds to their probable achievements had not the di&s;tempers of frail mortality &s;o lamentably en|cumbered the divinae particulam aurae. Even to the po|ets, who&s;e effu&s;ions &s;hould flow &s;pontaneous as from a prie&s;te&s;s on the &s;acred tripod, and demand not the &s;teady inten&s;e attention of philo&s;ophic &s;tudies, retirement, for the peace it gives, has ever been mo&s;t precious: but can any thing be more di&s;tant from peace than the condition of a man of a liberal mind who hourly finds him&s;elf in want of the decent ordinary comforts and conveniencies of life? His retirement indeed is likely from the temper of the fa&s;hionable world to be very complete if he can enjoy or employ it. Every man who knows the value of learning mu&s;t re&s;pect the learned and will feel a blu&s;h of indignation on his cheek when he remembers that they are often thus mi&s;erably degraded: different men will feel for them on different accounts, as opinion and &s;ympa|thy may prompt; but all I hope will feel for them as fel|low citizens and &s;ervants of the public. Let it be kept in mind for our own &s;akes that the notions of a man di&s;|tracted by cares which perpetually interrupt his &s;pecula|tions, or even by bu&s;ine&s;s which he mu&s;t attend to or &s;tarve, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come forth often in an imperfect

Truth demands full complete examination: upon a &s;ingle &s;tep in an inve&s;ti|gation may depend the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole proce&s;s in|cluding moral, political, or philo&s;ophical, principles, important in the la&s;t degree to the precious felicity of man. In the rays of unclouded genius the minute&s;t par|ticles of error are di&s;coverable like motes, in a &s;unbeam. But a man who writes under the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion, whe|ther goaded on by indigence or the dread of interruption, will &s;urely communicate to his performance the di&s;advan|tages he feels and they will appear in defective materials, perplexed arrangement, or impure diction. To the eternal regret of literary men immaturity in the works of poets &s;hew the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of competence and ea&s;e even to the accompli&s;hment of their lighter labors. One of the few perfect pieces of Dryden and that by which we form the be&s;t e&s;timate of his capacity, is the ode for St. Coecilia's day; and this was the only one, or with a few exceptions, upon which his wants allowed him to be&s;tow the requi&s;ite attention. The Aeneid, one of the few eminent poetic productions of length, was the fruit of &s;even years culture under the beams of royal munificence. The enormities of the greate&s;t dramatic genius of the world, whether &s;uffered to remain through the hurry of indigence or introduced to gratify a barba|rous ta&s;te in the public, abundantly prove the propriety of placing genius, more e&s;pecially that which conduces mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially to the common weal, above all vile con|trol.

Tho&s;e who know how little friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ts even among profe&s;&s;ed friends, and that a good hor&s;e u&s;ually renders his ma&s;ter more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervice than any friend he has, will not wonder that a friendle&s;s man of literature &s;hould not meet with much &s;upport from &s;trangers. How very &s;mall a part of every man's income is &s;pared from his plea&s;ures and employed for literary purpo&s;es, for his own improvement, or the advancement of &s;uch as might be induced to delight or in&s;truct mankind?

Men of di&s;tingui&s;hed fa|culties are u&s;ually agitated by more eager ardent pa&s;&s;ions than ordinary men, and "keen edged &s;words will cut their &s;cabbards." Tho&s;e who have mo&s;t wants will &s;urely in this world of grief feel mo&s;t the pangs of di&s;appoint|ment. Be&s;ides, the very exerci&s;e of fine talents will often weary them and di&s;order the body in which they act: to tho&s;e who embrace literature as an amu&s;ement it is a pre|&s;erver of health as a check to the mi&s;chiefs of debauch|ery; but intemperate &s;tudy brought on by the ardor of pur&s;uit impairs the con&s;titution; and there is always danger le&s;t the fire of genius &s;hould con&s;ume in its own blaze.

How great too is the &s;olici|tude of a writer who dreads to mi&s;s his end yet feels at every &s;tep the peril of deviation.

So true is it that men are not content with &s;tarving genius but &s;trive fir&s;t to degrade and drive it to de&s;pair: and though both the&s;e propen&s;ities di&s;play in odious colors &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, ingratitude or dullne&s;s wherever they appear, yet has the world &s;eldom afforded an in&s;tance wherein one or both of them might not commonly be ob&s;erved. Can any thing be better fitted to wound the feelings and depre&s;s the ardor of a real genius than the frivolous,
<PB N="62" REF="025162_0064_0FCE8C861A32C980">affected, and malevolent, remarks of &s;uch a writer as Warburton? a fa&s;tidious critic without ta&s;te; a charac|ter as in&s;ufferable as a proud man without integrity. The want of judgment in particular departments of literature which is ob&s;ervable in &s;ome men of fine talents and per|fect candor acts as another check to literary attempts; and the erroneous cen&s;ures of &s;uch men mi&s;guide the multitude and mar the writer's hopes more effectually than the mo&s;t &s;tudied devices of dulne&s;s or malevo|lence. The mind of Locke, exalted as it was, was ne|verthele&s;s not above the admiration of the poems of Blackmore, and might therefore not improbably have been without the di&s;criminating &s;en&s;e of Pope's or Mil|ton's beauties. On the other part, men of the brighte&s;t fancies are &s;ometimes unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that portion of the faculty of judgment which qualifies to decide upon the merits of a philo&s;ophic di&s;&s;ertation. Dr. John&s;on, though in many in&s;tances a di&s;cerning critic, &s;ays of certain pa&s;|torals, "it is &s;ufficient blame to mention that they are pa&s;|torals," yet would tho&s;e of Virgil, though he had writ|ten nothing el&s;e, have brought down his name with ho|nor to our time; and Pope's, though he has borrowed freely from the other, would have convinced us he was capable of the graces of the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> though he had never written it. But men of the be&s;t ta&s;te and genius do not always judge accurately even in their own departments, as they do not deny. A good critic in flowing &s;pirits may ea&s;ily di&s;regard the tender meltings of an elegy; and another overwhelmed with grief is
<PB N="63" REF="025162_0065_0FCE8C890E8B53E0">blind to all the charms of wit. Men of melancholy or &s;aturnine con&s;titutions &s;hould be careful how they pro|nounce upon the quality of a gay production, unle&s;s fe&s;|tivity or &s;ome other occa&s;ional cau&s;e &s;hall have made a temporary alteration in their characters; otherwi&s;e they will want the entertainment which &s;uch pieces are in|tended to afford, and the ill-fated author may have rea|&s;on to rue their un&s;ea&s;onable gravity. Fal&s;taff &s;ays of Prince John, "Good faith, this &s;ame young &s;ober-blood|ed boy doth not love me: nor a man cannot make him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine." If from various cau&s;es genius err thus in its decrees, what &s;hall be expected from folly? and how intolerable mu&s;t it be to a fine writer to &s;ee blockheads prefered to him|&s;elf, or, if he be a generous man, to behold the neglect of great talents in another. All the&s;e intended wound|ings of the critic &s;courge whether inflicted by virtue or vice, &s;en&s;e or non&s;en&s;e, are felt too at a time when it is become extremely difficult to employ with &s;ucce&s;s after &s;o many others, old modes of writing, or, after &s;o many others, to invent new.</P>
<P>BUT though the labors of accompli&s;hed writing are very great and the &s;ucce&s;s extremely uncertain, yet let us &s;uppo&s;e what will never happen, that literature &s;hall be fa&s;hionable without being made re&s;pectable, &s;econdly that the public &s;hall be content to feed to &s;atiety every eminent writer with the only food he can ever obtain from them in their individual capacity, I mean with
<PB N="64" REF="025162_0066_0FCE8C8A25499BC8">prai&s;e. As a di&s;tingui&s;hed wit has &s;aid of &s;ome of the critics above &s;poken of,
<Q><L>"Rules for good writing they with care indite</L>
<L>And &s;hew us what is bad by what they write."</L></Q>
So a very fine poet has given this precept&mdash;
<Q><L>"Let &s;uch teach others who them&s;elves excel,</L>
<L>And cen&s;ure freely who have written well."</L></Q>
It is ea&s;y for a good writer to adopt this rule in his prac|tices to other men as directed; but there are al&s;o tho&s;e who&s;e candor and accuracy of ta&s;te are &s;uch that they do not he&s;itate to adopt &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;uch rigid di&s;cipline in the correction of their own performances: wanting other cen&s;ure the fine&s;t writers, being them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of their ta&s;k, have often ri&s;en above the little weakne&s;&s;es of vanity and pa&s;&s;ed, like Brutus, a rigid &s;entence upon their offspring; ever find|ing them below &s;ome fancied model of perfection. Good writers like good morali&s;ts, are ever more indulgent to the errors of others than their own. Pope &s;peaking of &s;ome of the ancients, &s;ays,
<Q><L>"The gen'rous critic fann'd the poet's fire</L>
<L>And taught the world with rea&s;on to admire."</L></Q>
And can we ever &s;ufficiently applaud the &s;ublime friend|&s;hip of Virgil which could with-hold him from becoming the rival of Horace in the province of lyric poetry, or the unequalled candor and exqui&s;ite refinement of ta&s;te which could lead him to di&s;cover in a poem of his own, one of the mo&s;t noble and perfect in the world, faults which could induce a re&s;olution to con&s;ign it to that

Nay &s;uch is the perver&s;e fate of fine writers that they have not only the ta&s;k of producing a work which &s;hall be deemed admirable as a whole, but they are often driven to the hazardous nece&s;&s;ity of weakening particular parts to give additional force and effect to the re&s;t, as mu&s;i|cians introduce forced modulations and di&s;cords to rai&s;e the character of the melody and harmony which are to &s;ucceed. To this practice perhaps may be referred many inequalities in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t;</HI> and perhaps Homer was unju&s;tly cen&s;ured when it was &s;aid of him,
<Q>Indignor quando&abque; bonus dormitat Homerus:</Q>
Pope perhaps was of this opinion when he &s;aid
<Q>It is not Homer nods but we that dream.</Q></P>
<P>LET us now proceed to take notice of &s;ome further rea&s;ons why a &s;uitable encouragement only can render completely efficient to the public &s;ervice the talents of the citizens even when they &s;hall have been cultured in tho&s;e numerous &s;eminaries of learning which have with &s;o much propriety been e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout this coun|try, and daily are increa&s;ing; and to ob&s;erve that it mat|ters little to the community how much any man may ex|cel his fellows in wi&s;dom and learning while he wants opportunity, or, which in many ca&s;es is the &s;ame thing, encouragement, to make them known. We will &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="025162_0068_0FCE8C8E8FB14DB0">in the fir&s;t in&s;tance that in addition to wi&s;dom and learn|ing a man &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s as much activity of character as di&s;po&s;es and qualities him for &s;cenes of public bu&s;ine&s;s: but we may &s;uppo&s;e as ea&s;ily that &s;uch a man by peculiar circum&s;tances in his ca&s;e &s;hall be buried in ob&s;curity: he may be either the neglected offspring of an unfortu|nate gentleman, or the hope of a virtuous &s;en&s;ible parent who&s;e hou&s;e fortune never yet has &s;miled upon,
<Q><L>Sed fulgente trahit con&s;trictos gloria curru</L>
<L>Non minus ignoros genero&s;is.</L></Q>
Here then is a luminary hidden in a cloud; and who &s;hall bring forth its &s;plendors? Great talents are not within the &s;phere of common comprehen&s;ion; and patronage in &s;uch a ca&s;e would probably be indi&s;pen&s;ible; (in a free country ought this to be &s;o?) That in this &s;tate of con|cealment a genius &s;hould be di&s;covered, is at lea&s;t a matter of uncertainty.

Newton and Pope, were both ab&s;orpt in their different meditations; and the one would probably have been an inferior mathema|tician, the other an inferior poet, had each received double natural gifts and divided his efforts: not that a competency of general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arning is a bar, but rather, as in fine writing more e&s;pecially, a furtherance to par|ticular excellence: Milton was an univer&s;al &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

Cicero has made virtue an e&s;&s;ential qualification of an orator; and it is certain that the mo&s;t intere&s;ting themes of declama|tion and tho&s;e which are fitted to kindle the enthu&s;ia&s;m of con&s;ummate art, have a near affinity with virtue and the happine&s;s of men. In the in&s;tance mentioned on a for|mer occa&s;ion it was the purpo&s;e of Demo&s;thenes to rou&s;e the Athenians to a proper &s;en&s;e of the dangers which threatened their country when public &s;hews and other means of di&s;&s;ipation had enervated and vitiated their cha|racters; but how could this be effected by any but a man who was him&s;elf free from this general corrup|tion? Without the feelings of a patriot, without his griefs, his fears, his indignation, his magnanimity, how might he hope to animate, to &s;ublimate, his di&s;cour&s;e, till it &s;hould touch a pal&s;ied heart? how but in con&s;cious purity and dignity could he pre&s;ume to hold the mirror up to vice, or hope to lure her from her joys? To &s;uch a

In any &s;tate which has parted with its freedom if a combination of circum&s;tances &s;hall at any time have exalted rhetoric and given it a manly &s;pirit, very &s;oon will luxury, prodigal|ity, avarice, and political profligacy, ema&s;culate its powers: affectation and theatric rant will be &s;ub&s;tituted for feeling, meretricious ornaments and fal&s;e refinement for &s;trong &s;en&s;e and &s;imple &s;ublimity. Or tho&s;e in whom the nerve, the hardihood, of virtue and genius are not yet extinct, &s;hall fly from the unhallowed haunts of men in mute de&s;pair. Compare the powerful effu&s;ions of Mr. Burke in the proud day of his integrity with the imbe|cility of his later efforts, &s;unk and degraded as he is in his apo&s;tacy from the faith of liberty! The fir&s;t are as the lofty &s;trains of Tully the &s;aviour of his country, the terror of evil-doers, of traitors, and u&s;urpers, in the commonwealth of Rome; the la&s;t but the &s;oft warb|lings of the mutilated &s;ons of Italy in her degenerate days. Long did this unhappy man re&s;i&s;t the ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> influence of courts; but he yielded at length to the per|nicious contagion; his head and heart became &s;ophi&s;ti|cate, and he a&s;&s;umed the general di&s;po&s;ition in bad go|vernments to &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reat and overlook or cru&s;h the helple&s;s; he turned to folly and became a &s;lave.

<PB N="72" REF="025162_0074_0FCE8C998A9BF528">that he is bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me too vicious to endeavor good, too fee|ble to accompli&s;h evil; and di&s;covers the black malignity without the potency of demons. He has bla&s;ted the brighter glories of his life and the venerable graces of declining age; he has a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with a party the mo&s;t ba&s;e, cruel, and abandoned, that ever exi&s;ted in any nation or generation of human kind; an unna|tural confederacy again&s;t virtue, again&s;t wi&s;dom, again&s;t liberty, and the reviving happine&s;s of man. Such are the evil con&s;equences of evil governments, and the ap|pointment of flagitious rulers. In a &s;tate where every power of the mind and body, every doctrine, every e&s;|tabli&s;hment, every hope and every fear, are employed to mi&s;lead and degrade the people a hero's firmne&s;s mu&s;t uphold a man in the dignity of human nature; but un|der an e&s;tabli&s;hment wherein freedom, education, litera|ture, and eloquence, concur to &s;trengthen and &s;upport, he mu&s;t indeed be meaner than the meane&s;t &s;lave who gives his mind to weakne&s;s and his heart to &s;in. Happy Americans who while all other nations through the va&s;t expan&s;e of nature bow down in &s;orrow to a tyrant or brave his uplifted &s;word to break his rod, have gained al|ready ble&s;&s;ings above all price, and may &s;till hope for others through every &s;tage of time, wi&s;dom, and expe|rience. If when au&s;picious ages fun their round, your liberty, your felicity, mu&s;t be no more, our eyes reach not the di&s;tant dreary pro&s;pect, or are dazzled by the blaze of intervening glories. But the advantages in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or in expectation, can be &s;ecured &s;o well by nothing as
<PB N="73" REF="025162_0075_0FCE8C9A26AB6DE8">by the aids of literature. The progre&s;s of America in arts may be made rapid even to our wi&s;hes. The intel|lectual powers of other nations have u&s;ually expanded &s;lowly under the imbecility induced by oppre&s;&s;ion: cher|i&s;hed as &s;he is by freedom America may be made to &s;tep from childhood to maturity; &s;he is a lu&s;ty infant and has already &s;trangled a &s;erpent in the cradle.

<P>THE full licen&s;e which the form of our government allows for inve&s;tigation is at pre&s;ent the only incite|ment to literary indu&s;try; but were &s;uitable encourage|ment &s;uper-added thereto an extreme eagerne&s;s peculiar to a good cau&s;e and very favorable to its &s;ucce&s;s, would quickly animate the powers of the learned; and the emoluments they might receive from any in&s;titutions in their favor would be repaid an hundred fold by their &s;ervices. The condition in which America does now, and for &s;ometime to come, will &s;tand, both as a tree, and a new, country, demands in a very particular manner the united efforts of all vigorous minds whereby &s;he may be enabled to apply, improve, and obtain, advantages: and, whether through the form of the government, or the genius of the people, a di&s;po&s;ition to u&s;eful &s;pecula|tion is more frequent here than any other literary pro|pen&s;ity, and might be rendered infinitely beneficial. In all the &s;tates of Europe, France excepted, few men can
<PB N="74" REF="025162_0076_0FCE8C9B67BCBAC0">enjoy the luxury of writing a di&s;qui&s;ition with any hope of its being acted upon; a wi&s;e and virtuous man at|tempting to do good in a bad government rolls the &s;tone of Si&s;yphus, or labors like Enceladus with a mountain on his brea&s;t. The ma&s;culine, original, and candid manner of thinking, in matters which regard the happi|ne&s;s of human kind, and which the new and intere&s;ting &s;tate of things in America has generated, is almo&s;t un|known in old e&s;tabli&s;hments long accu&s;tomed and recon|ciled to abu&s;es. In &s;uch &s;ituations the mind is circum|&s;cribed and it is as much impo&s;&s;ible to range at large the paths of truth as to travel in the walls of a pri&s;on. It is no wonder then that under the&s;e circum&s;tances litera|ture has u&s;ually been confined to &s;ubjects of mere theory or curio&s;ity, to the neglect of the mo&s;t u&s;eful practical &s;peculations. In America we do not amu&s;e our&s;elves with &s;triving to prove what we all know very well with|out it, the exi&s;tence of matter or time, or di&s;puting about what it is of no con&s;equence to determine, whether matter be infinitely devi&s;ible, or whether a &s;imple unit in matter occupies no &s;pace at all. It is of much greater importance to us to know and upon all occa&s;ions to bear in mind &s;uch things as the&s;e (which &s;eem but very lately to have attracted the notice of European nations) that man is compo&s;ed of certain parts, be they what they may whether either of them be admitted to be material or not, one of which cannot be lacerated by the bayonet or the rack of a tyrant without &s;uffering much pain; that the other part which is called &s;pirit or mind, cannot be in|&s;ulted
<PB N="75" REF="025162_0077_0FCE8AF832BD1ED8" MS="y">or unlawfully re&s;trained without angui&s;h of ano|ther kind: and that both the matter and the &s;pirit being thrown together into a dungeon, allied as they are in one &s;y&s;tem, will both grieve mi&s;erably together; and this di&s;tre&s;s will be afflicting in proportion to the number of weeks, months or years they may be confined, whether weeks, months &amp; years be parts of time or not. So much has the human mind been hitherto deprived by tyrants of exerci&s;e and food that its bulk and &s;trength are probably yet but infantine. If France and England have done &s;o much under the controling hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, what may not be expected from the powers of intellect acting as they do in America without check or hindrance, if to the mo&s;t perfect freedom and a &s;en&s;e of duty be added the motives which &s;pring from intere&s;t and con|venience? Even in England, the ea&s;ie&s;t of en&s;laved &s;tates, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is declared to be mi&s;chievous; and tho&s;e who &s;tarve while they labor to pamper their oppre&s;&s;ors un|der an old e&s;tabli&s;hment, are taught to believe that in|novation is an evil. Chivalry is exalted above patrioti&s;m, and the be&s;t chivalry, not that which is employed again&s;t a giant or enchanter in favor of an individual, but again&s;t a de&s;pot for the relief of a wretched degraded nation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he chivalry of Na&s;&s;au and Wa&s;hington is branded with terms of infamy and reproach. What then of improvement is to be expected in a country wherein the people are in|&s;tructed to think no more? Wherein this doctrine is ap|plauded by the &s;eminaries of learning, the reputed &s;ources of the wi&s;dom and religion of the nation, while royal
<PB N="76" REF="025162_0078_0FCE8C9FDA462A70" MS="y">fulminations come in aid to drive them from their wits? Accordingly the Briti&s;h nation has hitherto made very little u&s;e of political wi&s;dom. Their applauded con&s;titu|tion is but a fortuitous combination of parts a&s;&s;embled together by the intere&s;t of parties; as, when the com|mons by an intrigue were introduced into parliament as a check upon another branch of the legi&s;tature; and when the barons, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the neglected ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics, obtaind from king John &s;everal conce&s;&s;ions in favor of them&s;elves and the people. What had origi|nated in a party was ever conducted in conformity to the views thereof as &s;uch, whether of York or Lanca&s;ter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or pre&s;byterian, whig or tory: in all the&s;e tran&s;actions not only the pro&s;perity of the people at large, but even of tho&s;e of the prevailing party, has been po&s;t|poned to the favorite object of a king or leader: the&s;e ill-fated men have ever been neglected by haughty de&s;|pots, or mi&s;led by hot brained zealots, or in&s;idious de|magogues. What el&s;e than this do we di&s;cover in their hi&s;tory, whether amid&s;t the din of arms, the clamors of the &s;enate, the cry of patrioti&s;m, or the cant of &s;uper|&s;tition?

If the &s;ervice and in&s;truction of a free nation were worthily requited, the improvement would be without example. Common &s;en&s;e, the faculty by which truth is di&s;tinctly di&s;cerned through the veil of which cu&s;tom, prejudice, laws, con|&s;titutions, or lawle&s;s power, had drawn over it, has at length regained a portion of long lo&s;t dominion over the minds of men. By this faculty could Paine bind one nation in an unanimous re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the encroach|ments

When u&s;eful writers are drawn out in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion each in his turn gives double power to him who goes before, and him who follows after; and they form together an im|penetrable, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, phalanx to brave the a&s;&s;ault of in|&s;olence, ambition and wickedne&s;s, and to bear down the firme&s;t champions of prejudice and error. Minds which may be ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uch objects as are mo&s;t imme|diately conducive to the great end of human felicity, are perhaps, as has been hinted above, more frequent in America than in all Europe taken together before the French revolution. How delightful is it to contemplate in the character of Dr. Franklin, that &s;imple and &s;ublime wi&s;dom and benevolence which could de&s;cend to the humble employment of preparing rules for the accom|modation of &s;uch of his fellow-creatures as might be ex|po&s;ed to the inconveniences of a tedious voyage; or on &s;hore might be di&s;po&s;ed to amu&s;e them&s;elves with a pack of cards; and afterwards could ri&s;e to the momentous bu&s;ine&s;s of founding a mighty empire, or di&s;arming the lightning of its terrors! The re&s;tle&s;s gloom of an idle Engli&s;hman, and the ennui which the mo&s;t animated na|tion of the world could once feel in its low e&s;tate, may be utterly extermined from a &s;cene wherein objects per|petually pre&s;ent them&s;elves which intere&s;t the mind through the medium of delightful pa&s;&s;ions, admiration,
<PB N="79" REF="025162_0081_0FCE8CA5312A97F8">joy, emulation and benevolence. Even now, frivolity is &s;carcely known, except in the characters of a few giddy boys who&s;e birth &s;ets them above labor, and who&s;e talents do not rai&s;e them to any re&s;pectable occupation; who are too young or too ignorant to be right, and too old to be whipt for being wrong. When di&s;&s;ipation &s;hall have become more fa&s;hionable than at pre&s;ent throughout the&s;e &s;tates encouragement will become more indi&s;pen&s;i|ble to literary efforts and they will be le&s;s efficient: in the interim it would check di&s;&s;ipation in its progre&s;s. In|du&s;try in literature might be made the means of benefits which no &s;agacity or fore&s;ight can anticipate. The ha|bits of indu&s;try induced in the &s;tudy and practice of the learned profe&s;&s;ions do u&s;ually, notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;|&s;ary avocations, advance the character in the various walks of &s;cience much more than that of a private man of education. Exten&s;ive cities which co-operate with other cau&s;es in di&s;tracting and enervating the mind and withdrawing it from literary pur&s;uits, are not yet to be found among us; but even this circum&s;tance, while the public neglects literature, will operate again&s;t it al&s;o. In the &s;ocial intercour&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch places only, the learned may accidentally obtain that per&s;onal defer|ence which may help to con&s;ole them under pecuniary di&s;advantages: there too might connexions with men of influence accidentally be formed which only could be ex|pected to pu&s;h their fortunes.

<P>LITERATURE de&s;erves the &s;upport of government not le&s;s for its moral than its intellectual influences. The object of legi&s;lation &s;hould be to promote among the citi|zens a &s;pecies of happine&s;s worthy of the dignity of hu|man nature; which can be done by no other means than the union of virtue and wi&s;dom. Where &s;ucce&s;s is pro|bable, as in free &s;tates, ought any thing to be left unat|tempted? How far the very form of a government may operate in amending the character of man, we &s;ee already in a variety of in&s;tances among our&s;elves. In the &s;hort &s;pace of twenty years many prejudices and errors, &s;ome of them of the mo&s;t pernicious nature, which have been rooted in the mind perhaps ever &s;ince the creation of the world, have been totally extirpated. The enlightened and liberal principles which originated from the political advantages of the&s;e &s;tates when colonies, generated the American revolution; this revolution fir&s;t taught her citizens, next the citizens of France, and &s;oon perhaps will teach all the nations of Europe, that tho&s;e wars with which the ferocious ambition of monarchs has &s;o long di&s;turbed the earth are wicked and murderous; that as they have had no object &s;o far as concerned the people but a change of tyrants, any man employed in them was a &s;lave and ruffian, though the favorite of an empe|ror and the leader of millions.

In a bad government even the diver&s;ions of the citizens partake of its character.

<P>HAVING lent my feeble aid to the unfriended cau&s;e of learning, unfriended probably through the pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ities of a new-born government, the foregoing ob&s;er|vations are humbly &s;ubmitted to the active minds of my countrymen as hints which may &s;erve to recall pa&s;t no|tions and to &s;ugge&s;t others.

<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON, at a point of time the mo&s;t awful and momentous his country had ever known, or could ever know, was appointed to the &s;upreme com|mand of her armies. This elevated employment, which to every proud and ambitious man in the nation was an object of the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire, became to him, through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mode&s;ty and heroic moderation, an honorable burden. He re&s;igned the tranquility of retirement and con&s;cious integrity, and &s;et at hazard a happy life and ample fortune, for greatne&s;s without exultation, and of|fice without emolument. In the execution of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s which was committed to his charge he di&s;played the firmne&s;s of a hero, the prudence of a general, the in|tegrity of a patriot, and the honor of a gentleman. His virtue was not the phrenzy of Ari&s;tides or Brutus building their country's greatne&s;s upon the &s;poil of na|tions; it was the virtue of rea&s;on combating for the op|pre&s;&s;ed not becau&s;e they were fellow-citizens, but becau&s;e they were fellow-men; founding, but not &s;ubverting, a mighty empire; not to in&s;ult, but to redre&s;s; not to en|&s;lave, but free the world. He obtained the confidence of his country during her &s;truggle for happine&s;s without the &s;malle&s;t mixture of &s;u&s;picion. He was not only in every department of his office unblamed, but cover|ed with applau&s;e and glory; the homage of the people was love, veneration, gratitude; and they di&s;covered

Jealou&s;y, envy, and calumny, if they wi&s;hed to &s;trike, dared not to aim the blow in the pre&s;ence of an American citizen. Nor among American citizens only was his name inviolate; amid&s;t the rancour of civil broils, the mo&s;t injurious, ignoble, and murderous &s;lave, &s;till &s;pared his virtues; and tho&s;e who &s;ought his life denied that he de&s;erved to die.

Like Augu&s;tus he was a de&s;pot, but knew not the refinements which could &s;ooth the rage of injured va&s;&s;als. His occupations like Nero's when they were not wicked were frivolous. But even Nero at an early &s;ea&s;on put forth the buds of virtue which peri&s;hed by the pe&s;tilent breath of flattery: George on the contrary ru&s;hed with &s;udden eagerne&s;s into the corruption, the black atrocity of policy: he did not indeed like Nero di&s;appoint the hopes of his &s;ubjects

The offices of government he ba&s;ely put to &s;ale, receiving in payment the liberties of his &s;ubjects. He plunged the kingdom into a debt of an hundred millions for the lo&s;s of thirteen flouri&s;hing colonies. This enormous debt, contracted by a war which involv|ed the Briti&s;h nation in difficulties and di&s;graces which never may have end, was accumulated on a former &s;till greater; but the fir&s;t had been incur'd by his prede|ce&s;&s;or in a war which had exalted Britain to greater heights of glory than &s;he had ever reached before. He mingled together crimes and errors gro&s;s and mounta|nous; he heaped O&s;&s;a upon Pelion and Olympus upon O&s;&s;a.

Whether the per&s;onal agency of &s;uch a king attempting to triumph over &s;uch &s;ubjects would have been effectual, &s;eems to have been a que&s;|tion which never engaged his attention; the only law of his country which he was not di&s;po&s;ed to violate was

<P>IT is aftoni&s;hing and &s;hocking to hear even in America the mild de&s;poti&s;m, as it is &s;ometimes called, of the old French govern|ment &s;poken of with commendation or indulgence: and, &s;ince we know the chain of tyranny which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a &s;tate, and the influence of power in corrupting the heart, it is a &s;oleci&s;m to call any de&s;poti&s;m mild. The people of France it is &s;aid have always been gayer and therefore happier than their freer neighbours, it is therefore contended that the form of their government was &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;es. Let it be remembered however that tranquility, not gayety, is the te&s;t of happine&s;s. Tranquility is the habit of a contented mind; it is the repo&s;e of the &s;oul; gayety is an occa&s;ional gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion di&s;tinct from and often encouraged, as the &s;ub&s;titute of happine&s;s. This tranquility, or this gayety, I conceive, is not &s;up|po&s;ed to have been known in tho&s;e dungeons whence multitudes who had &s;urvived their griefs were re&s;cued by the reformed government be|reft of their &s;en&s;es by de&s;pair. We know that the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e wretches who were de&s;tined to be the &s;port of a graduated &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion were great enough to appal the imagination of a di&s;tant &s;tranger; how much then mu&s;t tho&s;e have trembled who could hear the groans of an ill-&s;tar'd fellow creature and fellow &s;ubject, and knew not but their hour of angui&s;h was at hand? Too well they &s;aw, and terrible in&s;tances have tran&s;pired &s;ince the revolution, that even the neare&s;t relatives have not always &s;pared each other. But admitting that with &s;o many cau&s;es of di&s;quiet as exi&s;t in every unlimited mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">man could be capable of a competent portion of hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="108" REF="025162_0109_0FCE8CD5DA5DE890">yet can it not be doubted that the portion of happine&s;s would have increa&s;ed by the extinction of the&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;quiet, and a a freeman di&s;contented with every rea&s;on to be happy, would &s;urely be more di&s;contented with none at all. Providence has evidently in|tended that no human being &s;hould ta&s;te happine&s;s or mi&s;ery in the extreme through the cour&s;e of his exi&s;tence. Under no concurrence or combination of circum&s;tances, numerous as the human race has been; and with the chance of good fortune though expo&s;ed to the ha|zard of bad, has any one in&s;tance of a happy man appeared upon re|cord; the purpo&s;e of which perhaps has been to reconcile the unfor|tunate to their fate, no man being exempt from trouble; and to pre|vent the pro&s;perous from &s;inking into a &s;elfi&s;h &s;tate of voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, and being unmindful of tho&s;e duties which may procure their pa&s;&s;port into &s;ome &s;tate of perfect felicity; and though, for the purpo&s;e la&s;t mentioned, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the human race u&s;ually pre|ponderate; yet does the mercy of heaven appear in all in&s;tances however calamitous, and often in the mid&s;t of &s;evere&s;t trials. A|greeably to the&s;e de&s;igns man has been framed to be forcibly acted upon by long e&s;tabli&s;hed habits: the habits of plea&s;ure and pain dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;e of either. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing therefore that the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t nations &s;hould find &s;omething to wi&s;h for, and the mo&s;t en|&s;laved &s;omething to enjoy, but this does not de&s;troy the di&s;tinction be|tween freedom and &s;lavery, nor their influence upon the happine&s;s of man: nay, free brutes if furni&s;hed with the means of life are happier than tho&s;e which are detained in a &s;tate of re&s;traint.</P>

<P>THE boroughs upon this occa&s;ion were repre&s;ented in what was called a convention of the people, principally by the pre&s;byterians; and Walpole's execrable &s;y&s;tem of liberty not having been at that time introduced, this body of men acted with a becoming di&s;regard to the claim founded on hereditary rights; yet does the reform in the repre|&s;entation &s;eem never to have come under their contemplation as an ex|pedient
<PB N="109" REF="025162_0110_0FCE8CD8204D8BE8" MS="y">mea&s;ure. This however is not be wondered at as this re|form would have extingui&s;hed the influence of their own con&s;tituents; and u&s;eful as it would be at this hour it might perhaps then have been dearly purcha&s;ed by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Stuarts and the introduc|tion of popery: this however appears doubtful &s;ince the revolution in France. One thing is clear; that the acts of the body of men then a&s;&s;embled to tran&s;act the national bu&s;ine&s;s were not the acts of a convention of the people; fir&s;t, becau&s;e the repre&s;entation of the commons was very unequal; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e the lords maintained as u&s;ual their parliamentary authority; nor were the&s;e acts the acts of parliament, becau&s;e no king &s;at upon the throne; no rational doubt then can remain whether the acts were illegal.</P>

<P>SINCE this tract was &s;ketched out, the following pa&s;&s;age from the notes to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Hayley's fourth epi&s;tle upon epic poetry, has come under the ob&s;ervation of the writer. "It has lately been lamented by an elegant and accompli&s;hed writer who had too much rea&s;on for the complaint, that <HI>the profe&s;&s;ion of litera|ture, by far the mo&s;t laborious of any, leads to no real benefit.</HI> Ex|perience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to im|poveri&s;h its votaries; and the legi&s;lators would act perhaps a wi&s;e, at all events an honorable part, if they corrected this tendency, by e&s;tabli&s;hing public emoluments for &s;uch as eminently di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves in the various branches of &s;cience. It is &s;urely po&s;&s;ible to form &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment which, without proving a national bur|den, might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation by pre&s;erv|ing her men of letters from the evil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o frequently connected with their pur&s;uits, by &s;ecuring to tho&s;e who de&s;erve it the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ca&s;e and honour, without damping their emulation or de&s;troying their independence."</P>
<P>PUBLIC rewards only can in any country rai&s;e literature to the eminence of which it is capable; but the pre&s;s it&s;elf might in
<PB N="110" REF="025162_0111_0FCE8CD99665A868">&s;ome ea&s;es be rendered the mean of advantages not at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It has been ob&s;erved above that as literary property is now circum&s;tanced a writer who publi&s;hed at home may be rob|bed of a portion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> profits by a foreign book&s;eller who &s;hall reprint, or by a dome&s;tic one if he &s;hould publi&s;h abroad. There &s;eems indeed no good rea&s;on why a man may not print a book for his own benefit in &s;everal countries at the &s;ame time and in each retain the copy right. But it might often happen that the author or the printer to whom the copy &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old, would find it inconvenient to print a book in a di&s;tant country as well as his own: wherefore an agreement between two &s;tates who &s;peak the &s;ame language to prohibit the practice of re-printing from each other &s;uch books as may be publi&s;hed in future, would operate as a &s;uperior encouragement. A propo&s;al for &s;uch an a|greement would probably be acceptable to Great-Britain; for the number of books annually publi&s;hed in that country does now very far exceed tho&s;e publi&s;hed in the &s;ame time in the United States; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e with which property is obtained by means of agri|culture, commerce, law, and phy&s;ic, together with the va&s;t field pre&s;ented to the view of each department in our exten&s;ive territory as population gradually extends, will for a long time to come keep up the &s;uperiority of numbers in Briti&s;h writers. Something indeed might be lo&s;t to America in the printing line if re-printed books are &s;old cheaper than tho&s;e imported; but the Engli&s;h books already in circulation afford ample materials for this bu&s;ine&s;s; nor &s;hould a narrow piece of political economy be &s;uffered to &s;u|per&s;ede the great concerns of literature: the direct application of written wi&s;dom to political purpo&s;es will quickly overbalance any trifling di&s;advantages induced. How far too the exten&s;ion of the term of copy right may be beneficial is worthy of con&s;ideration: and in all regulations or e&s;tabli&s;hments for the propagation of learning it &s;eems to be advi&s;able that every new attainment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a writer &s;hould come to him as the reward of &s;ome &s;pecific perform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce, that his pro|fits

<P>THE impre&s;&s;ion made upon the Briti&s;h arms by the capture of Burgoyne and the &s;pirit di&s;played upon that occa&s;ion by the militia of New-England are well known: at the battle of Bennington eight hundred of the&s;e militia without bayonets or artillery, forced the en|trenchments of five hundred regular troops armed in the be&s;t manner and furni&s;hed with two pieces of artillery, killing or making pri|&s;oners the greater part and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field pieces.

<P>IT was once intended to introduce into parliament, the late lite+rary idol of the Briti&s;h nation, Dr. John&s;on. He would doubt.

It would have been intere&s;ting and curious to ob&s;erve, what fine &s;peculative &s;en&s;e, keen &s;arca&s;m, tory rancour, bigotry, &s;piritual pride, and matchle&s;s effrontry could do again&s;t intuitive wi&s;dom, the rage of oratory, the integrity of a patriot, and the dignity of a gentleman. A greater in&s;tance of the ty|ranny of fa&s;hion cannot be produced than the boundle&s;s reputa|tion of Dr. John&s;on. It appears evidently, even from the partial records of his particular friend, that he had the prejudices of a clown, the &s;uper&s;tition of a go&s;&s;ip, the weakne&s;s of an infant, the arro|gance of a tyrant, and the manners of a &s;avage; yet has he been placed foremo&s;t in the tribes of Engli&s;h &s;aints and philo&s;ophers. He was di&s;covered to be an eminent poet too, becau&s;e he imitated two &s;atires of Juvenal, and wrote a tragedy which is neither acted nor read, and which in the latter of his life, when his ta&s;te had got the better of his vanity, he him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;ed. Anacreon's dove has indeed all the force and elegance of an original, and, had it been &s;uch, would have done him more honor than all his other poems. The encomiums lavi&s;hed upon his imitations, tran&s;lations, and famous prologue, &s;hew how little el&s;e has been found in his ver&s;es worthy of admiration: and the compo&s;itions of Pope in the&s;e kinds added to the merit of his greater pieces place him in &s;uch a &s;tate of exaltation, that it is not to be conceived how any man, who &s;tands &s;o far beneath him as John&s;on, can be a poet. In one of his poems of gallantry (mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abile dictu) he learnedly complains to the lady of "arthritic pains."

<P>WE have &s;poken above of the diver&s;ity of talents, and among other in&s;tances, of the di&s;parity which appears in the faculty of memory. Though memory &s;tanding alone obtains but little re&s;pect, yet when united with nobler faculties it ri&s;es in value exceedingly. It does lit|tle of it&s;elf which we can admire, but enables the judgment, wit, or fancy, to effect wonders. Memory by recovering at will lo&s;t notions of our own or others, or facts, forms combinations, elicits truth, and creates poetry, eloquence, wit, or humour. By this faculty, as the hand-maid to others, was Dr. John&s;on empowered with &s;o much facility on a &s;udden to di&s;cu&s;s a variety of points in writing or con|ver&s;ation. To the advantages obtained by memory in advancing life may &s;ometimes be a&s;cribed the great &s;uperiority in many ca&s;es ob&s;er|vable in the proportionate powers of the boy and man. However, the power of effecting a purpo&s;e &s;o far as it comes from memory is not genius; learning is not genius though mo&s;t &s;kilfully employed thereby.</P>
<P>Remarkable in&s;tances of nice di&s;crimination in genius appear in the characteri&s;tic walk. Very di&s;tinct talents are exerted in the delinea|tion of characters in a drama, an epi&s;tolary, and a narrative, work. How admirable, yet how different are the powers di&s;covered by Shake|&s;peare, Richard&s;on, and Fielding? Yet their object was the &s;ame,
<PB N="115" REF="025162_0116_0FCE8CE1D8036660">though perhaps neither could have attained it by the means adopted by the re&s;t. Shake&s;peare though &s;o well able in words to repre&s;ent the whole race of men exactly as they are, found it impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;onate them upon the &s;tage. He who acquitted him&s;elf to the a&s;|toni&s;hment of the world in the lofty &s;phere of dramatic writing, could yet fall &s;hort of excellence in the analagous, and humbler capacity, of a player. It is intere&s;ting to enquire what might be the effect of propagating the &s;pecies through a long &s;eries of generations by the union of tran&s;cendent and congenial minds: the improvements made by culture in the &s;train of hor&s;es might warrant the experiment. Strength and &s;wiftne&s;s are the faculties mo&s;t e&s;teemed in hor&s;es; in men, the intellectual powers: why then might not the con&s;equent melioration in either ca&s;e be proportionate? why might not a being ultimately be produced as far &s;uperior to the fir&s;t of human creatures, as the fir&s;t cour&s;er now at New-Market to the be&s;t known in Europe before the introduction of the breed of Arabia? Who can &s;ay that man is not capable of ri&s;ing as far above Newton, Locke and Mil|ton, as they &s;tand above ordinary characters? As we find in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things that &s;ome men can on a &s;udden accompli&s;h more in the exerci&s;es of the mind than others with the mo&s;t laborious &s;tudy, why might not a brood of genius be obtained which &s;hould &s;urpa&s;s as much every fortuitous production? Philo&s;ophers and mathe|maticians who when called upon &s;hould on the in&s;tant vie with the re|&s;earches of Locke, or the &s;chemes of Newton? Orators who &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the vigor of Demo&s;thenes and the grace of Tully? Poets like the bard of Paradi&s;e,

<P>SO much is the bulk of the Engli&s;h nation under the influence of &s;illy prejudices with regard to the form of their government, that they were extremely enraged with the Americans becau&s;e they too would not adopt erroneous principles. Having been long accu&s;tomed to be taxed and oppre&s;&s;ed by a parliament in which the repre&s;enta|tives of the fourteen hundredth part of the citizens had the greate&s;t number of votes, and to be amu&s;ed with the notion of a virtual re|pre&s;entation &s;aid to be enjoyed by the re&s;t, they wi&s;hed to propa|gate this doctrine in the colonies. The&s;e however had been long ble&s;&s;ed in the advantages of a real and &s;ub&s;tantial repre&s;entation and di&s;regarded the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gared fallacy. It is &s;trange indeed, that a repre&s;en|tation &s;hould in either ca&s;e be termed virtual which in England had at be&s;t only virtue enough to cru&s;h the people equally in every cla&s;s, and in America not &s;o much as this, becau&s;e the modes of taxation would nece&s;&s;arily have been di&s;criminated by local circum&s;tances, and the parliament were to have determined where and how heavily the weight &s;hould fall. The haughtine&s;s which has prevailed in England with re&s;pect to &s;urrounding nations is well known and has ari&s;en from the &s;uperiority of their government (bad as it is) over all tho&s;e which heretofore exi&s;ted among them, and from their con&s;equent opulence and naval vigor. It is not therefore to be wondered at that America, in her colonial &s;tate, &s;hould have been con&s;idered merely as an ap|pendage; as a tail to a mighty comet; and that &s;he &s;hould have been deemed by every drunken boor, or boori&s;h &s;quire, no more than pro|perty which belonged to England. Well might &s;o vain an imagina|tion

Both in England and America this in&s;idious virtual repre&s;entation could do no otherwi&s;e than throw the whole direction of a profli|gate parliament into the hands of an atrocious monarch. The truth is that the citizens of that country po&s;&s;e&s;s no powers of legi&s;la|tion; the whole of their vaunted freedom re&s;ides in their judicial &s;y&s;tem; how long that citadel &s;hall be maintained it mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e to determine who are &s;o deeply, &s;o awfully concerned: and they will do well to enquire whether lord chief ju&s;tice Mansfield not|with&s;tanding his highly extolled judicial integrity, did not decide in favor of the king, in all cau&s;es between him and his &s;ubjects, as ob|&s;equiou&s;ly as the dete&s;ted Jefferies in the reign of the Stuarts, who had the infamous effrontry to boa&s;t that he was the fir&s;t judge who had ever been able to put the life of an innocent Engli&s;hman into the hands of his prince. Slavery can be&s;t make her approaches under the ma&s;k of liberty: This knew Julius Cae&s;ar when he refu&s;ed the proffer|ed crown; and Augu&s;tus when he &s;tood for the con&s;ul&s;hip. The Eng|li&s;h have ju&s;t liberty enough at pre&s;ent to con&s;ole and re&s;train them from outrage under the le&s;s of the re&s;t; other nations of Europe having enjoyed none, &s;eem at length re&s;olved to obtain it complete; and the Engli&s;h without a revolution, will po&s;&s;ibly be le&s;s free than any. It is notorious that the Briti&s;h king, like queen Ann, encour|ages tho&s;e doctrines by the di&s;grace of which he reached the throne;
<PB N="118" REF="025162_0119_0FCE8CE6801218D0" MS="y">and that the nation has no means of redre&s;s but a revolution, or a con|vention of the people for the purpo&s;e of equali&s;ing the repre&s;entation, a reform which would it&s;elf be a revolution incomparably the be&s;t that kingdom ever knew. Many <HI>independent</HI> enlightened Engli&s;hmen (and no other, &s;uch is the dreadful influence of the crown) believe the&s;e things; and the wi&s;dom and virtue of the people, even in the in&s;tan|ces wherein they are found united, will form a formidable power whenever they &s;hall be brought into full operation; great &s;pirits &s;till abound among them; and great indeed are tho&s;e which re&s;i&s;t the raging pe&s;tilence of royalty.</P>
