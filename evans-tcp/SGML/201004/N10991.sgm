<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER III.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Thy name, O Chatham, with &s;ome few more, is made, rare in&s;tance, immortal by defeat; and to thee NEW HONOURS ri&s;e from the ruins of thy country. While you live, never fading laurels, the ju&s;t reward of thy virtue, conduct, and fidelity, &s;hall crown thy hoary head, and &s;hade thy venera|ble brow.&mdash;And may thine and Britain's ravi&s;hed eyes behold thy foes and hers, for their treachery and villainy, dragged to execution, dre&s;&s;ed and di&s;|honoured in funeral ROSEMARY and the baneful YEW.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO follow you regularly through every &s;tep of a fourteen years &s;hameful and inglori|ous reign, would be a ta&s;k as painful as di&s;agreeable, and far exceed the bounds of this paper; but we are called upon by the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, the mea&s;ures you are pur&s;uing, by every principle of ju&s;tice and &s;elf pre&s;ervation, and by the duty we owe to God and our country, to de|clare our &s;entiments (with a freedom becoming Engli&s;hmen) on &s;ome of tho&s;e dreadful tran&s;actions and oppre&s;&s;ions which this kingdom has laboured under &s;ince the glory and lu&s;tre of England's
<PB N="18" REF="013918_0002_0F925799DDE70B68">crown was doomed to fade upon your brow; and to point out to you, Sir, your own critical and dangerous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Sir, it is not your rotten troop in the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons; it is not your venal, beg|garly, pen&s;ioned Lords; it is not your polluted, canting, pro&s;tituted bench of Bi&s;hops; it is not your whole &s;et of abandoned Mini&s;ters; nor all your army of Scotch cut-throats, that can protect you from the people's rage, when drove, by your oppre&s;&s;ions, and till now unheard of cruelties, to a &s;tate of de&s;peration.</P>
<P>The day, we fear, is not far di&s;tant, when you will have rea&s;on, too much rea&s;on, to wi&s;h you had acted like a father, and not like a tyrant; when you will be bound to cur&s;e tho&s;e traitors, tho&s;e exalted villains, whom now in the face of day, without a blu&s;h, you can be ba&s;e enough to call your friends; be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, your danger is great amid&s;t all this fancied &s;ecurity, and it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve you from the ju&s;t re|&s;entment of an enraged, long abu&s;ed, and much injured nation: Should that day ever come, but Heaven avert the &s;troke, where can you hide your|&s;elf from the tenfold vengeance of a brave and mighty people, with law, ju&s;tice, heaven, and all its &s;acred truths on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>Then, like the wounds that bleed afre&s;h, will be brought to their minds your barbarous and un|provoked ma&s;&s;acre in St. George's Fields; when men and women were indi&s;criminately and inhu|manly &s;laughtered, to gratify what would have di&s;graced even your footman; a pitiful revenge. Then, Sir, they will remember, with horror and indignation, the letter of thanks &s;ent from the Secretary of war, by your order, to the officer on
<PB N="19" REF="013918_0003_0F92579A810C8A18">duty the 10th of May, 1768 (the day of carnage) and likewi&s;e your pen&s;ioning, and &s;creening the murderers from the puni&s;hment of the law. Then, Sir, they will remember the horrid plan laid at Brentford, for de&s;troying the right of election; or in the mo&s;t &s;avage manner to take away the lives of the freeholders of Middle&s;ex, which was (to make u&s;e of a word from your merciful royal dictionary) effectually carried into execution, and &s;everal people killed; to this plan, Sir, formed by Proctor and your minions, you mu&s;t have been privy, as the event afterwards &s;ufficiently proved.&mdash; Then, Sir, they will remember the mean, low, and criminal &s;ubterfuge, you had recour&s;e to, to di&s;pen&s;e with the laws, and &s;et a&s;ide the ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">erdict of an hone&s;t jury to pardon tho&s;e hired ruffians, Balf and M'Quirk, convicted upon the cleare&s;t evidence of premeditated murder. Then, Sir, they will remember the in&s;ults they received, and the ignoble an&s;wers you gave, to the remon|&s;trances and petitions, delivered by them to the throne, praying a di&s;&s;olution of parliament. Nor will they forget, Sir, the infernal plan for &s;mug|gling the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons, and de|&s;troying all the rights of this free country. In a word, Sir, the&s;e and every other de&s;potic and bloody tran&s;action of your reign, will ri&s;e fre&s;h in their minds, if they &s;hould be drove by your en|couragement of popery, your per&s;ecutions, your oppre&s;&s;ions, your violations of all ju&s;tice, your treachery, and your weakne&s;s, into a fatal and un|natural civil war in America; I &s;ay, they will ri&s;e fre&s;h in their minds, and &s;timulate them to deeds of glory, nay, they may pur&s;ue with implacable revenge the author of all their mi&s;eries.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="013918_0004_0F92579B8DC05AF0">
The people, Sir, with a candour and indulgence peculiar to Engli&s;hmen, pa&s;&s;ed over the injuries and in&s;ults in the fir&s;t part of your reign, or kindly laid the blame at the door of your mini&s;ters; but it is now evident to the whole world, that there was a plan formed by Lord Bute and your&s;elf, either before, or immediately after you came to the crown, for &s;ubverting the Briti&s;h con&s;titution in church and &s;tate; which to our grief, with in|defatigable pains and too much &s;ucce&s;s, Lord Bute's tools and your infernal minions have carried into execution; therefore it no longer remains to deter|mine who is now the greate&s;t criminal in England.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Sir, if through the late and pre&s;ent iniquitous mea&s;ures, and an ob&s;tinate re&s;olution in your Maje&s;ty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> SWORD is forced to be drawn in America, it cannot remain long un&s;heathed in England; we hope there is &s;ome virtue here; and we entertain a better opinion of our countrymen, than to believe they are &s;o far degenerated as to TAMELY &s;ee a mercenary army of &s;oldiers, who are at all times a terror to the peaceable inhabitants of every free &s;tate BUT|CHER their BRETHREN and FELLOW SUB|JECTS in America, becau&s;e they are determined to defend their own rights and the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution; I &s;ay they never will TAMELY &s;ee that, without putting out a helping hand, and &s;haring with them the glory of a deci&s;ive victory over tyranny, and all the agents of the infernal monarch of the dark regions of hell, who would en&s;lave the world.</P>
<P>Should you, Sir, &s;till pur&s;ue the &s;ame tyrannical mea&s;ures, only to gratify a mean vindictive &s;pirit, and be the author of &s;uch dreadful mi&s;chiefs; O, we &s;hudder at the thought! The people will then per|haps
<PB N="21" REF="013918_0005_0F9257A0A7490D78">treat you, Sir, with as little ceremony, as little re&s;pect, and as little mercy, as you and your minions have treated them; for, Sir, whenever the &s;tate is convul&s;ed by civil commotions, and the con&s;titution totters to its centre, the throne of England mu&s;t &s;hake with it; a crown will then be no &s;ecurity, and at one &s;troke all the gaudy trap|pings of royalty may be laid in the du&s;t; at &s;uch a time of dreadful confu&s;ion and &s;laughter, when the &s;on's weapon drinks the father's blood, and we &s;ee a ruffian's blade reeking from a brother's heart, when rage is burning in the brea&s;ts of Engli&s;h|men, provoked by wrongs not to be borne by men, all di&s;tinctions mu&s;t cea&s;e; the common &s;afety and the rights of mankind, will be the only objects in view, while the King and the pea&s;ant mu&s;t &s;hare one and the &s;ame fate, and perhaps fall undi&s;tingui&s;hed together.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e things, Sir, be well weighed; tremble for the event; drive tho&s;e traitors from your brea&s;t, who now &s;urround you; let the ju&s;t and hone&s;t have your confidence, and once more make your people happy, great and free; be not the in&s;tru|ment of their de&s;truction; con&s;ider the &s;olemn and &s;acred oath you made at your coronation, to pro|tect your &s;ubjects in all their rights and liberties, and the Prote&s;tant religion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; con&s;ider, Sir, what a perver&s;ion of all right and ju&s;tice that mu&s;t be (be&s;ides the heinous crime of perjury) when in&s;tead of being their PRO|TECTOR, you become their DESTROY|ER.</P>
<P>Your plan, Sir, for bringing the colonies by force of arms into a &s;tate of &s;ubjection to your will, is cruel, bloody, and, I hope, impracticable. It is repugnant to every principle of humanity, ju&s;tice,
<PB N="22" REF="013918_0006_0F9257A287F72388">&s;ound policy, and the natural rights of mankind; it is the foule&s;t di&s;grace to you, and will reflect eternal infamy on your reign and memory, as the Sovereign and father of a free people; it is &s;uch a plan of encroaching violence and lawle&s;s power, as the Americans never can, never ought, nor ever will &s;ubmit to; it is &s;uch a &s;cheme for en&s;laving, or de&s;troying the human race, as every man ought to execrate and condemn, and to oppo&s;e even till he peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Men, Sir, at three thou&s;and miles di&s;tance mu&s;t think it extremely hard to work, toil, and run hazards, only to &s;upport the infamous luxury of high pampered Lords, a rotten court, and your tribe of venal &s;enators, minions, pimps, and pa|ra&s;ites, the pe&s;t of &s;ociety; and to be taxed and mulct by them at their plea&s;ure. All nature, Sir, revolts even at the idea of &s;uch a &s;tate of human mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Force, Sir, can never be u&s;ed effectually to an|&s;wer the end, without de&s;troying the colonies them|&s;elves. Liberty and encouragement are nece&s;&s;ary to keep them together, and violence will hinder both. Any body of troops con&s;iderable enough to awe them, keep them in &s;ubjection, and under the direction of a needy Scotch Governor, &s;ent only to be an in&s;trument of &s;laughter, and to make his for|tune, would &s;oon put an end to planting, and leave the country to you, Sir, and your mercile&s;s plun|derers only; and if it did not, they would &s;tarve the inhabitants, and eat up all the profit of the co|lonies. On the contrary, a few prudent laws, Sir, (but you &s;eem to be a &s;tranger to prudence as well as to ju&s;tice and humanity) and a little prudent conduct (that too has been long de&s;paired of by the kingdom) would &s;oon give us far the greate&s;t &s;hare of the riches of all America; perhaps drive
<PB N="23" REF="013918_0007_0F9257A45036B220">other nations out of it, or into our colonies for &s;helter.</P>
<P>If violent methods be not u&s;ed, at this time, to prevent it, your Northern Colonies, Sir, mu&s;t con&s;tantly increa&s;e in people, wealth, and power; their inhabitants are con&s;iderably more than dou|bled &s;ince the Revolution; and in le&s;s than a cen|tury mu&s;t become powerful &s;tates; and the more powerful, the more people will flock thither. And there are &s;o many exigencies in all &s;tates, &s;o many foreign wars, and dome&s;tic di&s;turbances, that the&s;e Colonies can &s;eldom want opportunities, if they watch for them, to do, what you, Sir, might be extremely &s;orry for; throw off their dependence on the mother country. Therefore, Sir, it &s;hould be your fir&s;t and greate&s;t care, that it &s;hall never be their intere&s;t to act again&s;t that of their native country; an evil that can no otherwi&s;e be averted, than by keeping them fully employed in &s;uch trades as will increa&s;e their own, as well as our wealth; for, Sir, there is too much rea&s;on to fear, if you don't find employment for them, they may find &s;ome for you. Withdraw then, Sir, from America your armed ruffians, and make a full re&s;toration of the people's rights; let them tax them&s;elves, and enjoy their property unviolated by the hand of tyranny; thus, Sir, the &s;ub&s;equent part of your reign may yet be happy and glorious. May the compact between you and the people be no more invaded; may you be &s;peedily reconciled to the ju&s;t demands of the Colonies; may Lord Bute, Lord Mansfield, Lord North, and all your Maje&s;ty's infamous minions, who would precipi|tate you and the kingdom into ruin, an&s;wer with their heads (and &s;oon) for their horrid crimes; and may the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in your Maje&s;ty's Royal Hou&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="013918_0008_0F9257A518847D40">and the religion, laws, rights, and liberties of the &s;ubject go hand in hand down to all po&s;terity, un|til this globe &s;hall be reduced to its original chaos, and time be &s;wallowed up in eternity.</P>
