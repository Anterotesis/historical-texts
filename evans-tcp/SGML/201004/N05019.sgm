<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AGAIN a &s;econd time, my dear Country|men, a &s;incere well-wi&s;her to you and all your intere&s;ts pre&s;umes, on your experienced pati|ence and good-nature, to addre&s;s you. The hour of terror and di&s;tre&s;s was hardly over, and the cloud, which had for &s;ome time hung black and gloomy over this Nation, threatning to bur&s;t upon it in a tempe&s;t of general de&s;truction, was but ju&s;t be|ginning to break, when a former weak but well meant Repre&s;entation was laid before you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t edition of <HI>Britain's Remembrancer,</HI> the Piece here under|&s;tood, was publi&s;hed in the month of <HI>January,</HI> 1745-6, when the Rebel-army was flying before the Duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> by whom they were totally defeated at the battle of <HI>Culloden</HI> the 16th day of <HI>April</HI> following. The chief de&s;ign of the Piece was to point out the nati|onal vices and follies we were called upon by that vi&s;itation to reform.</NOTE> In a &s;torm at &s;ea it is common not only for profe&s;&s;ed mariners and pilots to exert them&s;elves for the &s;afety of the &s;hip, but likewi&s;e, in ca&s;e of need, every private pa&s;&s;enger thinks him&s;elf obliged to lend what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he can for the benefit of the whole. In the &s;ame manner, in a time of national danger, whoever has the deliverance of his country &s;incerely and earne&s;tly at heart, will not &s;o much con&s;ider his own Qualifications for doing any thing to avert or mitigate the judgments of Heaven, as the Need there is that &s;omething be done; and will accordingly contribute his
<PB N="6" REF="006294_0004_10285436316BCB60">mite, and exert his abilities, &s;uch as they are. To &s;lip an opportunity of acknowledging the candid reception given by you to what was offered on that occa&s;ion, would be both uncivil and unju&s;t: though at the &s;ame time, To gain the <HI>Attention</HI> or even the mo&s;t univer&s;al <HI>Approbation</HI> of Readers, will by no means give full &s;atis|faction to a writer, who&s;e aim is at &s;omething differ|ent from both, and who had rather &s;ee one per&s;on <HI>fol|low</HI> his advice than a thou&s;and approve and yet <HI>neglect</HI> it. However, they, who give a friendly monitor a fair <HI>hearing,</HI> are more likely in time to think of taking his coun&s;el than they who will not &s;o much as <HI>hear</HI> him. That the face of affairs in this nation is altered very much for the better &s;ince the above-mentioned period, is certain. That in place of the immediate pro&s;pect of a general confu&s;ion, likely to end in the &s;ubver&s;ion of our civil and religious liberties, or in a la&s;ting and bloody civil war, we now &s;ee Rebellion mortally wounded, and breathing its la&s;t; the &s;word of ju&s;tice drunk with its blood, and her &s;elf tired and &s;atiated with vengeance; the liberties of our country and the prote&s;tant religion the more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed for their having been &s;haken by the late commotions. And have we then no more to think of or to fear, or do we imagine Heaven has but <HI>one</HI> Judgment to puni&s;h national Wickedne&s;s or Indolence? Surely, if ever it be the duty or intere&s;t of a nation to endeavour, by a &s;uitable conduct, to gain or keep the favour and pro|tection of Omnipotence, it is more peculiarly &s;o of a people favoured by &s;o many and &s;o &s;ignal interpo&s;itions as we have been. But alas! the happy effect, which might have been expected from our deliverance, to wit, the correcting of our follies and vices, has not yet appeared clearly enough, to &s;hew that the late vi&s;ita|tion has done its work, &s;o as to render a more &s;evere and effectual one unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But, to proceed to the Subject of the following pages:
<PB N="7" REF="006294_0005_10285437C2189F00">In the former E&s;&s;ay, among other particulars, one is mentioned, as well worthy the attention of the nation, and likely to contribute greatly to its advantage, both by its <HI>natural</HI> con&s;equences, and by the probability of its drawing down a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> upon us, to wit, <HI>The vir|tuous and religious Education of the Youth.</HI> The &s;ubject could not be there fully treated on, and therefore your &s;erious attention is de&s;ired to the following additional thoughts on a matter, which is not only in it &s;elf of the utmo&s;t importance, but which likewi&s;e &s;eems in a peculiar manner to want a hearty recommendation to the regard of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Age.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary that any Parent or In&s;tructor of youth, who believes the Chri&s;|tian religion, be told, That a &s;trict account will certainly be required, at the hands of all per&s;ons, of whatever the divine providence has committed to them; and that, as no <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> that can be committed to any per&s;on, is of equal importance with that of <HI>immortal Souls,</HI> it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, no neglect whatever will be &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed in another world as the neglect of the &s;ouls committed to the care of Parents and In&s;tructors of youth, e&s;pecially con&s;idering, That the &s;ouls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of their Parents and In&s;tructors than even tho&s;e of a People are to their Pa&s;tor; as per&s;ons arrived at years of di&s;cre|tion may be &s;uppo&s;ed (if they have had a proper edu|cation) in a great mea&s;ure capable of conducting them|&s;elves; whereas the utter <HI>incapacity</HI> of Youth lays them almo&s;t wholly at the mercy of their Parents or In&s;truc|tors for a &s;et of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life, upon which their happine&s;s through eter|nity depends. And can tho&s;e Parents or In&s;tructors of youth, the number of which, it is to be feared, is not &s;mall, be &s;aid to di&s;charge faithfully and thoroughly this awful tru&s;t, who are &s;o far from endeavouring to form the minds of the youth under their care, and to
<PB N="8" REF="006294_0006_1028543D8956D2C8">e&s;tabli&s;h them on &s;olid and rational principles of Virtue and Religion, that many of them do not &s;eem to think any &s;uch thing nece&s;&s;ary to be attempted, and that a youth educated either to an <HI>employment</HI> by which he may gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, or accompli&s;h'd in the polite <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences</HI> (if his birth be &s;uitable) has had full ju&s;tice done him by tho&s;e to whom the charge of him was committed by providence. One would think no parent or in&s;tructor of youth, who believes that a day of accounts will come at la&s;t, &s;hould be able to think without trembling, of the terrors of it, le&s;t the Judge &s;hould then &s;ay to &s;uch as have been negligent of the &s;ouls committed to their care, <Q>Thou wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> xxv. 26.</NOTE> oughte&s;t thou not to have improved to the utmo&s;t the opportunity put in thy hands, of being u&s;eful to thy fellow-creatures, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e immediately entru&s;ted to thy care? How ha&s;t thou &s;hamefully <HI>neglected</HI> what thou might'&s;t have faith|fully and worthily <HI>performed?</HI> How ha&s;t thou, in&s;tead of being of the greate&s;t &s;ervice in thy &s;tation and a ble&s;&s;ing to numbers, proved unworthy of thy place in &s;ociety, and the cau&s;e why numbers have come &s;hort of happine&s;s. In&s;tead, therefore, of the <HI>reward,</HI> that might have crowned thy labours, receive the <HI>doom</HI> due to thy wickedne&s;s and negligence.</Q> Nor will it be agreeable to any parent or in&s;tructor of youth in that day, to hear any unhappy per&s;on, formerly under his care, reproach him in the following manner. <Q>Had you faithfully and &s;trictly di&s;charged your duty to me, I had not probably been mi&s;erable this day. Had you warned me of the dangers of vice and irre|gularity, I might have e&s;caped them. Had you laid before me the rewards of virtue and religion, I might perhaps have a&s;pired at them. Why did you, in my days of youthful weakne&s;s and inexperience,
<PB N="9" REF="006294_0007_10285441DCEC3878">keep me in the dark, and &s;uffer me to mi&s;take my way to happine&s;s for want of a guide? How could you be &s;o cruel to one incapable of injuring you? How could you neglect a work &s;o agreeable? How could you trifle with what was of &s;o much con&s;equence to one you pretended to love? Had you no ambition to lay the foundation of a &s;tructure, which might have ri&s;en higher and higher through eternity? Had you no zeal to be found faithful in the tru&s;t committed to you? Henceforth nothing remains but the cruel reflection on the lo&s;s of all the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy we might have given to one another, had you &s;een me arrive at that happi|ne&s;s you had endeavoured with &s;ucce&s;s to lead me to, and had I had rea&s;on to thank you for your care in pointing me the way; in&s;tead of which &mdash;</Q> But this is a &s;ubject too &s;hocking to enlarge any farther upon. Let it &s;uffice to add, at pre&s;ent, That as, on the one hand, the forming of a rational mind to virtue, religion, and happine&s;s is the mo&s;t glorious work an angel, an arch|angel, or any created Being can be employed in, &s;o, in all probability, it will meet with the highe&s;t reward<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>They that <HI>bring</HI> many to righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;tars for ever and ever." <HI>Dan,</HI> xii. 3. "Who&s;oever &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commandments, and &s;hall <HI>teach</HI> men &s;o, &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven,</Q> (that is, &s;hall have no part in the Chri&s;tian &s;alvation) <Q>but who&s;oever &s;hall do and <HI>teach</HI> them, the &s;ame &s;hall be; called <HI>great</HI> in the kingdom of heaven.</Q></NOTE>; on the other, as the neglect of an immortal &s;oul is a breach of the mo&s;t important tru&s;t that can be committed to any per&s;on, it is likely to meet with the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Man being a creature de&s;igned not only for a &s;hort and uncertain duration in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, but al&s;o for an everla&s;ting one after this is at an end, from the hour of his entrance into the world, an exi&s;tence commences, which is to go on through eternity, and therefore from that time a con&s;tant regard ought to be had, fir&s;t by tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="006294_0008_1028544516513DD8">to whom the care of him during his minority is com|mitted, and afterwards by him&s;elf, to each &s;everal <HI>Pe|riod</HI> of his exi&s;tence, and likewi&s;e to the unmea&s;urable and endle&s;s <HI>Whole.</HI> If the opinion of the mo&s;t judicious be true, <HI>viz.</HI> That the very milk an infant &s;ucks may have &s;uch an influence upon his pa&s;&s;ions and appetites as may affect his whole conduct through life, upon which every one knows how much his happine&s;s through eternity depends; I &s;ay, if this opinion be ju&s;t, it is plain, That nothing is indifferent or of &s;mall con&s;equence in the education of youth, even from the earlie&s;t infancy: but that, on the contrary, things, which at fir&s;t view may &s;eem trivial, may be followed by con&s;equences of a nature very far from trivial. I mention this particu|lar only by the By, it being my de&s;ign to in&s;i&s;t chiefly on the care of youth between the age of &s;ix and eigh|teen, before which la&s;t period if the mind of a per&s;on be not formed to virtue and religion, it is not to be expected it ever &s;hould afterwards.</P>
<P>Previous to every other &s;tep, that is to be taken in the education of a young per&s;on, is the forming and breaking his temper; by cheri&s;hing and encouraging the good qualities of it, as Emulation, or a laudable de&s;ire of excelling, Curio&s;ity, or thir&s;t after knowledge, Humility, Tractablene&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Fearfulne&s;s of of|fending, and the re&s;t; and by cru&s;hing and nipping in the bud the luxuriant or pernicious ones, as Anger, Pride, Re&s;entment, Ob&s;tinacy, Sloth, Fal&s;hood, and &s;o forth. If this work be neglected by parents till the age of Six be pa&s;t, it need hardly be attempted at all: for the mind &s;oon acquires a &s;turdine&s;s and ob&s;tinacy that is not to be conquered, and bad <HI>Habits</HI> become quickly, as it were, a part of the very &s;oul, and as hard to be eradicated as it would be to &s;eparate the faculties of the &s;oul from one another. A particular that mu&s;t make every wi&s;e and con&s;iderate per&s;on tremble at the thought of the con&s;equences of &s;uffering any other than good
<PB N="11" REF="006294_0009_10285446A46590E0">and virtuous <HI>Habits</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, and &s;hould make every Parent or Guardian of youth to the la&s;t degree &s;olicitous what <HI>Habits</HI> fir&s;t take root in the minds of tho&s;e he has the charge of.</P>
<P>The whole of education &s;eems to me to con&s;i&s;t of two parts, or to come under two general heads; the fir&s;t is, The accompli&s;hing a per&s;on in &s;uch parts of knowledge as may be u&s;eful for qualifying him to pa&s;s decently and comfortably through the <HI>pre&s;ent life;</HI> the &s;econd is, The right directing him how to prepare him|&s;elf for the <HI>everla&s;ting duration</HI> after this life is at an end, teaching him how to improve and ennoble his nature, and putting him in the way of attaining the <HI>favour of his Maker,</HI> which is only another phra&s;e for <HI>perfect hap|pine&s;s.</HI> And by how much an everla&s;ting duration ex|ceeds the fleeting dream of the pre&s;ent life, and by how much it is more fatal to be unprepared to enter upon eternity than upon the &s;tage of this world, by &s;o much undoubtedly it is of more con&s;equence that Parents and In&s;tructors of youth have a regard to the <HI>Morals</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of tho&s;e committed to their charge, than that their whole care be confined to their accompli&s;hments and attainments in <HI>&s;cholar&s;hip,</HI> and by &s;o much the more fatal a mi&s;carriage in the former than in the latter. I would not here be thought to in&s;inuate, That human literature is of &s;mall con&s;equence in education; on the contrary, I do not know one branch of knowledge, which any man (of a middling &s;tation, at lea&s;t, and who is endued with a tolerable mea&s;ure of natural &s;en&s;e,) had better be wholly ignorant of: for I am convinced, That giving the mind an early turn to <HI>Knowledge</HI> of any innocent kind is doing it a very eminent &s;ervice: be|cau&s;e, being an active and re&s;tle&s;s principle, it will, in its &s;earch after happine&s;s, run out in pur&s;uit after ei|ther the objects of <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> to wit, Plea&s;ure, Power, or Riches; or after tho&s;e of the <HI>Mind,</HI> to wit, Knowledge, Virtue, or Religion: and every one knows, how much
<PB N="12" REF="006294_0010_1028544B981B10F8">it were to be de&s;ired, that mankind would cultivate their <HI>rational</HI> rather than their <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> faculties, and place their happine&s;s in the acqui&s;ition of the objects of the former than the latter.</P>
<P>Were I to put together a sketch of what I think every youth ought to be in&s;tructed in, before the time of life that is proper for going to bu&s;ine&s;s or an univer|&s;ity, it would be much in the following manner.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the knowledge of <HI>Grammar</HI> &s;eems to be a thing of that univer&s;al u&s;efulne&s;s for leading people into a method of &s;peaking or writing their thoughts correctly and intelligibly, and of rightly apprehending tho&s;e of others, that I think no man (however low his &s;tation may be) ought to be without it, and that children, who&s;e parents either do not choo&s;e, or cannot afford them a cla&s;&s;ical education, ought to be taught Grammar in their mother tongue, the &s;cience being the &s;ame through all languages. Along with Grammar, <HI>Orthography</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI> ought to be taught; as nothing more betrays a mean and &s;ordid education than fal&s;e &s;pelling, nor is there any thing more apt to occa&s;ion mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of a per&s;on's meaning, which, in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ometimes prove fatal, than the want of proper points and &s;tops in his letters or other writings, and the running of one &s;en|tence into another.</P>
<P>The knowledge of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> (e&s;pecially the fir&s;t) &s;eems rather valuable on account of their being the foundation of mo&s;t modern languages, than for their own &s;ake. If it be true, which is commonly a&s;&s;erted, that there is &s;carce a radical word in any of the modern tongues of above two &s;yllables long, that is not derived from one or other of them, it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed a per&s;on, who is a perfect &s;tranger to the&s;e languages, can thoroughly enter into the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of his own mother-tongue. In in&s;tructing youth in the <HI>Latin</HI> language, I &s;hould think it advi&s;able to make them familiar with the <HI>Hi&s;torians,</HI> rather than the <HI>Poets,</HI> as
<PB N="13" REF="006294_0011_1028544E5B8AFAC8">the writings of the fir&s;t are truly u&s;eful and in&s;tructing, whereas tho&s;e of the la&s;t generally tend to hurt the morals of youth, or at lea&s;t to fill their brains with fal&s;e and romantic ideas, and to le&s;&s;en their value for truth. There are innumerable pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Ovid, Horace,</HI> and &s;ome others of the Heathen poets commonly in the hands of young people, that ought not to be in print, or any way expo&s;ed to public view in a Chri&s;tian country. And indeed the peru&s;al of the be&s;t of them is only tra|velling through fairy-land, and treading on inchanted ground. It is at lea&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that youth be guarded from the bad effects of too great an admi|ration for heathen poetry, by giving them early a ju&s;t contempt for its childi&s;h fables, and by &s;hewing them the advantages of our rational and &s;ublime religion when &s;et in contra&s;t with the ab&s;urd and wretched my|thology of the antients, which has nothing in it really valuable, except that a little knowledge of it &s;erves to illu&s;trate &s;ome ob&s;cure parts of hi&s;tory, as it has greatly clouded and darkened many more. The knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> language is worth the pains of any young per&s;on, who has lei&s;ure to attain it; for the &s;ake of reading the Septuagint tran&s;lation of the Bible, the New Te&s;tament, and the writings of the earlie&s;t Fathers of the Chri&s;tian church, in the original.</P>
<P>The <HI>French language</HI> is &s;o ea&s;ily acquired, that, though not one per&s;on in an hundred ever has any great oc|ca&s;ion for it in life, I think it is worth while for youth to employ &s;ome of their lei&s;ure hours in reading it.</P>
<P>The art of <HI>Writing,</HI> being a mechanical thing, may be acquired by a youth of any &s;ort of genius, bright or dull, through dint of practice and application.</P>
<P><HI>Drawing</HI> is an art both elegant and u&s;eful; but ought by no means to be forced upon every youth: for none but &s;uch as are born with a genius for it, will &s;ucceed at it.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> as it is not to be acquired without a natural
<PB N="14" REF="006294_0012_1028544FE09D8490">ta&s;te, &s;o it ought to be very &s;paringly indulged, where there is a genius for it. It is a bewitching art, and one way or others is hurtful to mo&s;t people, who delight in and practice it. If <HI>Dancing</HI> is to be learned at all, it ought to be di&s;patched in early youth, for various rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Knowledge of <HI>Numbers</HI> is wanted by almo&s;t every per&s;on, every day of his life: nor can the time be&s;towed in &s;tudying the elements of <HI>Mathematics</HI> be grudged by any one who knows their univer&s;al u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The art of <HI>Keeping accounts</HI> di&s;tinct and regular, after the <HI>Italian</HI> method, is &s;o beautiful, and at the &s;ame time u&s;eful, le&s;s or more, to people almo&s;t in all &s;tations in life, that I think no man ought to be without it, and the rather becau&s;e it is in it&s;elf &s;o &s;imple and ea&s;ily acquired.</P>
<P><HI>Geography</HI> is a &s;cience not le&s;s u&s;eful than &s;imple; for a per&s;on can hardly enter into any conver&s;ation, read any piece of hi&s;tory, or rightly under&s;tand an ar|ticle in a News-paper, without &s;ome knowledge of the &s;ituations of places: nor does it require any acutene&s;s of genius or inten&s;e application, being almo&s;t wholly a work of Memory.</P>
<P>I do not think it difficult to give mo&s;t young people, who have reached the age of twelve, tho' they be not intended for an academical education, a tolerable notion of theoretical <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> &s;o as to enable them to form &s;ome idea of the va&s;tne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and the general laws, by which its motions and revolutions are carried on. I think the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the &s;cience of <HI>Anatomy,</HI> or the knowledge of the &s;tructure of animal bodies, e&s;pecially the human. By communicating a little of the&s;e two la&s;t mentioned parts of knowledge to youth, they cannot mi&s;s being led to entertain high and elevated notions of the Maker and Governor of the world, and mu&s;t thereby be en|gaged to fear and obey him from rational and worthy
<PB N="15" REF="006294_0013_1028545448D78108">motives. There is indeed no part of the works of nature, the contemplation of which will not delight and improve a young and innocent mind, and al&s;o en|large and rai&s;e it above every thing that is mean or un|worthy of its attention; and the advantage of giving young people an early turn to <HI>Knowledge</HI> is not to be imagined, as it pre-engages them, before the dangerous and mi&s;chievous objects of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> get hold of them, and &s;erves for food to the mind, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t run after gratifications of a far inferior and more unworthy kind.

<P>To create in young people a contempt of the er|roneous and ill-judged applau&s;e of men, &s;uch in&s;tances as the following &s;hould be often laid before them, and the mi&s;takes of <HI>common opinion</HI> expo&s;ed to their ob&s;erva|tion. That we &s;ee the mo&s;t laborious, indu&s;trious, and u&s;eful part of mankind generally treated with neglect and contempt, and at the &s;ame time the idle, the inac|tive and mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s part of the &s;pecies, I mean, the rich, who feed and riot, and fatten on the labours of their fellow-creatures, adored as gods upon earth. That we &s;ee mankind admire learning, wit and courage in men, and out&s;ide beauty in the other &s;ex, and all the while neglect the le&s;s o&s;tentatious, but infinitely more va|luable virtues of humility, meekne&s;s, prudence, bene|volence, patience, and mortification. That the &s;uper|ficial multitude have di&s;graced the hone&s;t husbandman, who employs him&s;elf in rai&s;ing out of the earth what
<PB N="18" REF="006294_0016_10285461062987A8">is the &s;upport of the life of his fellow-creatures, with the contemptuous name of <HI>Clown,</HI> and have at the &s;ame time dignified tho&s;e wild-bea&s;ts called warriors, who &s;pend their lives in butchering their fellow-creatures, with the title of <HI>Heroes</HI> or <HI>Great-men.</HI> That according to the common opinion of mankind, it is no &s;hame to get wealth by grinding the face of the poor, by craft, by &s;craping, and all the mean arts that can be practi&s;ed with &s;afety from the laws of the land; but it is a great &s;hame to be poor for want of impudence to elbow mankind, or through too much narrowne&s;s of con&s;cience, or too much largene&s;s of heart. That, according to the opinion of mankind, affliction is of all things the mo&s;t to be dreaded, and pro&s;perity the mo&s;t to be de&s;ired; whereas the truth is quite the con|trary way: for that pro&s;perity generally hurts mens virtue, whereas adver&s;ity for the mo&s;t part &s;trengthens the mind, and makes the heart better; &s;o that the bulk of mankind being by divine providence &s;ubjected in the pre&s;ent &s;tate to various hard&s;hips and mi&s;eries, is a mark of the tenderne&s;s of the Governor of the world to his creatures. That according to common opinion, it is a greater happine&s;s to get and hoard up, than to deal out liberally and generou&s;ly; whereas in truth, to be&s;tow with prudence on the de&s;erving and indigent is like a God, and to &s;crape together riches, like an earth-worm. That according to common opinion, it is a crime in a man of fortune not to live extravagantly, that is, according to the vulgar notion, &s;uitably to his fortune. Whereas the truth is, that for a man of great wealth to &s;pend his whole income without be&s;towing a rea&s;onable proportion of it upon the truly indigent, is embezzling what was only <HI>intru&s;led</HI> to him, not <HI>given</HI> him; a great e&s;tate being properly a <HI>&s;teward&s;hip</HI> com|mitted to a particular per&s;on for trial of his charity, and his ab&s;tinence, as powerty is a trial of another &s;et of virtues, and not the effect of any partiality of divine

<P>A youth, early and frequently led to ob&s;erve in the&s;e and innumerable other in&s;tances the fal&s;e and errone|ous ways the multitude have of judging of men and things, mu&s;t &s;ee the folly of placing one's happine&s;s in their applau&s;e, and will thereby learn to de&s;pi&s;e the al|lurement of Ambition. And indeed it is the fault of his parents or in&s;tructors, if he be not made to under|&s;tand, that he who never knew to di&s;tribute un&s;een and unthanked, to &s;teal opportunities of doing worthy actions, never to be known publickly, till read out of the records, by which we are to be judged at the la&s;t day; who never could conde&s;cend to what the errone|ous world calls <HI>Meanne&s;s,</HI> for the &s;ake of doing good; that who never could do the&s;e things, and do them without &s;o much as a wi&s;h for any other approbation than that of his con&s;cience and his judge, and who has no reli&s;h for this fea&s;t of the mind in his private retirement, knows nothing of the di&s;intere&s;ted love of God and of goodne&s;s for their own &s;akes.</P>
<P>And, to prevent a young per&s;on's being in&s;nared by degrees, as he advances in life, into the love of money, and at length into covetou&s;ne&s;s, he ought to be made to under&s;tand, that the only real value of riches is, their being capable of being applied to the purcha&s;e of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, and to the relief of the indigent. That the contents of all the mines of <HI>Peru</HI> are not in reality &s;o valuable, as one acre of ground covered with wheat; and that a fre&s;h egg is of of more real worth than the diamond lately brought from the <HI>Brazils,</HI> of much the &s;ame bulk, which was valued at four hundred Millions; becau&s;e the fir&s;t will &s;ave the life of a human creature from famine; but the latter is not capable of being applied to any &s;ort of u&s;e, be&s;ides plea&s;ing the eye. That all above the con|veniencies of life is ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, and indeed trou|ble&s;ome. That after a per&s;on has acquired &s;uch a
<PB N="20" REF="006294_0018_1028546964A07AE8">competency as will keep him and his family above dependence, and in ea&s;y circum&s;tances according to his &s;tation in the world, it is not worth his while to go a &s;tep out of his way for the &s;ake of gain|ing ten thou&s;and pounds more, becau&s;e he can but live conveniently at la&s;t, and has no occa&s;ion to bring upon him&s;elf more cares and embara&s;&s;ments. That a few years will put an end to the life of the younge&s;t man alive, and that it will give him no more &s;atisfaction on his death-bed to reflect, that he has fifty thou&s;and pounds in the funds, than that there are fifty thou&s;and &s;hells at the bottom of the &s;ea. That, &s;uppo&s;ing every man in|fallibly certain of gaining an e&s;tate, who will take the pains for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which is very far from being the ca&s;e, ex|orbitant wealth and happine&s;s have nothing to do with one another, &s;ince we commonly &s;ee di&s;contented faces in gilded chariots, and day labourers making merry in &s;pite of toil and poverty. That the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great wealth expo&s;es men to a thou&s;and inconveniencies and temptations, &s;uch as, The incumbrance of a croud of &s;ervants and attendants, The continual buz of &s;lavi&s;h flatterers and hangers-on, The fatigue of over&s;eeing great affairs, or the vexation of lo&s;&s;es by entru&s;ting them to others, and, which is wor&s;e than all the re&s;t, The ri&s;que of one's virtue, through the &s;nares of the world, and the deceit of riches, which are &s;o hard to re&s;i&s;t, that we find in fact the rich are, generally &s;peaking, per&s;ons of the lea&s;t amiable or perfect characters. That the honours &s;aid to attend on riches are a mere cheat; &s;ince the ful&s;ome re&s;pect, that is paid to a rich man at his levee, is only a public proof given by the per&s;on, who pays it, of his own want of &s;en&s;e, in being &s;truck with what is of no real worth in it&s;elf; and being paid to the wealth, and not to the per&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, is by no means worth envying.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, as to Plea&s;ure, young people ought to be guarded as &s;trongly as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t its allurements by
<PB N="21" REF="006294_0019_1028546C8BC92E70">being forewarned of its bewitching nature, and dan|gerous con&s;equences, of its un&s;atisfactorine&s;s, and the natural and con&s;tant tendency it has to rai&s;e unquiet and re&s;tle&s;s imaginations and de&s;ires in the mind; but e&s;|pecially by being led into a ta&s;te of the <HI>innocent</HI> in&s;tead of the criminal plea&s;ures, and the <HI>mental,</HI> in&s;tead of tho&s;e of the <HI>&s;en&s;es.</HI> A ta&s;te for knowledge, and retirement, if young people can be drawn into it, and of the con|ver&s;ation of the few old people who are chearful, know|ing, communicative, and lovers of the conver&s;ation of youth, may do great &s;ervice toward pre&s;erving them from this mo&s;t dangerous and fatal &s;nare. They ought to be told, That there are no true plea&s;ures but what are lawful, and that tho&s;e &s;orts of enjoyments, which leave a &s;ting behind them, ought not to be called <HI>plea&s;ures,</HI> but <HI>troubles,</HI> and <HI>torments.</HI> They ought to be frequently put in mind, that it is only the good and vir|tuous who have any right to the plea&s;ures of life, or who indeed can truly enjoy them; for that it is a con|tradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that a per&s;on, who&s;e con&s;cience is wounded by guilt, and who&s;e mind (if he is not pa&s;t thinking, which is &s;till a wor&s;e &s;tate) mu&s;t be in con|tinual pain through remor&s;e for what is pa&s;t, and hor|ror at the thought of what is to come, &s;hould be capable of reli&s;hing any &s;ort of joy or comfort: but that a good man, who&s;e mind is calm and undi&s;turbed, has both the advantage of freedom from pain or fear, and a proper di&s;po&s;ition for reli&s;hing the natural and innocent plea&s;ures of life, and is like to receive infi|nitely more happine&s;s from them than a wicked man, becau&s;e he may ju&s;tly con&s;ider them as the gifts of a tender and bountiful father, who&s;e favour he has rea&s;on to hope for, which mu&s;t give them an additional reli&s;h, and becau&s;e he expects nothing from them, but what they will really afford, and has &s;till in re&s;erve a higher happine&s;s, after the gratifications of &s;en&s;e have done their part. Young people ought al&s;o to be led to con|&s;ider
<PB N="22" REF="006294_0020_10285472AEEFBF40">plea&s;ure as naturally and nece&s;&s;arily oppo&s;ite to every thing that is manly or great, as it tends to &s;often and enervate the mind, and to render it unfit for en|countering any difficulty, or applying to any labour. They ought to be told, That, whatever men may &s;ay, in the hours of mirth and jollity, in defence of a volup|tuous life, there needs no better confutation of the fal|&s;hood of their rea&s;oning, than what they them&s;elves furni&s;h: for, though mo&s;t people in the gay time of life are continually crying out, that they have not had half their &s;hare of the plea&s;ures of the world; in their old age, and on their death-beds they are generally found to lament, that they have enjoyed and indulged them a great deal too much. A youth ought to be told, that there is a great deal of danger, when he comes to die, of his having many neglects and omi&s;&s;ions to repent of; but that there is no fear of his repenting on his death-bed, that he had omitted to &s;ee a parti|cular, new play on the fir&s;t night, or &s;lipt an opportu|nity of getting drunk, or of debauching a virgin; &s;o that at lea&s;t a life of &s;obriety and ab&s;tinence is on the <HI>&s;afe</HI> &s;ide. Young people &s;hould al&s;o be prepared for oppo&s;ing and confuting the frivolous and fallacious ar|guments commonly advanced by their thoughtle&s;s com|panions of their own age, in defence of a life of plea|&s;ure; of which the mo&s;t formidable one I can at pre|&s;ent remember, is the following, <HI>viz.</HI> Since God has given us de&s;ires and appetites, why &s;hould we not gra|tify them at all events? Which thundering piece of artillery may at once be &s;ilenced by only retorting the following que&s;tion. Since God has &s;o formed me, that when I am extremely heated with exerci&s;e, I have a great de&s;ire to cool my&s;elf as quickly as po&s;&s;ible, why &s;hould I not throw off my cloaths, and expo&s;e my&s;elf to the air, though it &s;hould occa&s;ion my death? and &s;ince I have a great thir&s;t, why &s;hould I not drink a plentiful draught of cold water, though it &s;hould give
<PB N="23" REF="006294_0021_1028547436628410">me a &s;urfeit? and, in &s;hort, &s;ince God has given me a variety of appetites and inclinations, why &s;hould I not &s;atisfy them all at random, without the lea&s;t thought of the con&s;equences? They &s;hould be taught, that there is no de&s;ire or appetite natural to the human &s;pecies, but what may be <HI>innocently gratified,</HI> and may al&s;o be <HI>abu&s;ed;</HI> and that the rule to be ob&s;erved with regard to all the natural inclinations and appetites, is, To gratify them only in &s;uch a manner, and within &s;uch bounds of moderation, as will be&s;t &s;erve to gain the ends for which they were implanted in the human con&s;titution, and that whoever breaks through this rule is guilty of a crime. They &s;hould be forewarned, that taking a full &s;wing of lawle&s;s plea&s;ure in youth is only trea&s;uring up for all the following years of life an inexhau&s;tible fund of pain and torment, and this upon the mo&s;t fa|vourable &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That they afterwards repent of the follies of youth, which if it &s;hould not happen, the con&s;equences are &s;till infinitely wor&s;e. They &s;hould likewi&s;e be &s;hewn the ab&s;urdity of re&s;olving (as is too commonly done) to indulge them&s;elves in all the va|rious madne&s;s of youth, and to go on in a cour&s;e of guilty plea&s;ure, with hopes of repenting of it after|wards. That for a per&s;on to do &s;o, is to hope that he &s;hall be heartily a&s;hamed and confounded at what he has done; to hope that he &s;hall a thou&s;and and a thou|&s;and times wi&s;h it undone; to hope that he &s;hall hate and loath him&s;elf for what he has been guilty of; to hope that he &s;hall &s;uffer ten thou&s;and times more pain from &s;hame and remor&s;e than ever he enjoyed plea&s;ure in the pur&s;uit of criminal delights; to hope that he &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of knowing him&s;elf to have been a fool and a madman; to hope that he &s;hall have the happine&s;s of knowing, that he has done what may ju&s;tly expo&s;e him to the divine vengeance; to hope, that he &s;hall be obliged to undertake the di&s;agreeable and al|mo&s;t in&s;uperable task of rooting out confirmed habits,
<PB N="24" REF="006294_0022_1028547731862960">and planting oppo&s;ite ones in their place, of parting with vices as dear to him as a right-hand or a right-eye<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 8, 9.</NOTE>, and of wholly new modelling his mind; in &s;hort, it is to hope, that he &s;hall have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing him|&s;elf in great danger of final de&s;truction. Ble&s;&s;ed hopes! glorious pro&s;pects! worthy for which to give up one's innocence and peace of mind in the pre&s;ent life, and the pro&s;pect of happine&s;s in that which is to come.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure being the mo&s;t alluring and mo&s;t dangerous of the three principal baits that draw in mankind to the ways of perdition, and being more peculiarly pre|valent in the time of youth, I have been the more copious upon this head: but after all, I mu&s;t repeat, that I know of no method, that will have any chance of being effectual for &s;aving young people from its &s;nares, without giving their minds a turn another way, and leading them into a ta&s;te and love for objects and entertainments of a different nature.</P>
<P>By treating young people in this manner as <HI>rational creatures,</HI> and teaching them to exert their rea&s;on, and to judge rightly of men and things, as they are in them&s;elves, and as they were originally con&s;tituted by the Supreme Being, and not according to outward ap|pearance, they would come out into the world, not as the mo&s;t part of youth do from &s;chools and colleges, with heads full of unwieldy knowledge, the greate&s;t part of which they can apply to no u&s;e in life, but with judgments in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ettled and matured for action, and prepared for the difficulties of life by a &s;ort of anticipated experience.</P>
<P>But to come at length to the main intention of this E&s;&s;ay, I mu&s;t own, it is to me very &s;urprizing that many truly learned and ingenious men have been at &s;o much pains in contriving plans for education, and have all the while mi&s;&s;ed or overlooked the mo&s;t excellent and
<PB N="25" REF="006294_0023_10285479DCE2E1D8">mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive one that ever was or will be in|vented for forming and perfecting the mind, and rai&s;ing it to the nature almo&s;t of angels, and this &s;tate almo&s;t to that of Heaven, I mean the CHRISTIAN RELIGION. One author on the &s;ubject propo&s;es, that youth be taught principles of &s;trict honour, and a &s;trong aver&s;ion at fal&s;hood; another, that they be very early taught to con&s;ider them&s;elves as members of &s;ociety, and to love their country; and a third, that the examples of the great men of antiquity be &s;et before them, and that they be often put in mind of their conduct, and direc|ted to imitate it. All which &s;chemes are &s;o far ex|tremely good. But, if it be certain, that there are no <HI>Truths</HI> of equal importance to mankind, with tho&s;e that are di&s;covered by the Chri&s;tian revelation, that there are no &s;uch &s;ublime or &s;uch worthy <HI>notions</HI> of the <HI>&s;u|preme Being,</HI> no &s;uch ju&s;t notions of the nature of <HI>Man,</HI> no &s;uch clear views of his <HI>Duty</HI> and way to <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> to be found any where el&s;e as in the Chri&s;tian revela|tion, nor &s;uch a perfect and &s;ublime &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Morality,</HI> nor &s;uch a &s;et of illu&s;trious <HI>Examples</HI> of true greatne&s;s and heroi&s;m to copy after, nor &s;uch views of the direful <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of vice, nor &s;uch full and well e&s;tabli&s;hed Pro&s;pects of a final <HI>Reward</HI> to virtue communicated to mankind by any other means; why &s;hould Parents or In&s;tructors of youth &s;top &s;hort, and not rather re&s;olve at once to take the only effectual and complete method of forming and e&s;tabli&s;hing the minds of tho&s;e under their care by making them thoroughly acquainted with the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion?</HI></P>
<P>That the implanting in the minds of youth a &s;et of principles of virtue and religion upon the Chri&s;tian plan would be of the greate&s;t advantage to mankind con&s;i|dered either as individuals, or as members of &s;ociety, one would think, &s;hould not need much rea&s;oning or argu|mentation to prove.

<PB N="26" REF="006294_0024_1028547DACF5FAB0">affect to repre&s;ent it as either <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to be done with any con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, or as of <HI>inferior</HI> con&s;equence; which only &s;hews how men can blind or pro&s;titute their rea&s;on to &s;erve indirect ends. In&s;tead of going about to e&s;tabli&s;h the importance of a virtuous and re|ligious education upon a long deduction of arguments, or upon authorities from the writings of the greate&s;t men of antient or modern times, I &s;hall only take the liberty to leave with tho&s;e gentlemen the few follow|ing Queries, and then proceed without taking up a great deal of the lei&s;ure of other readers, to whom the importance of the &s;ubject appears evident and unque&s;|tionable.</P>

<P N="4">4.

<P>And far le&s;s would I advi&s;e, that youth be taught to place the whole of religion in violent Zeal for any party or for any particular opinions. On the contrary, they ought to be from their earlie&s;t years prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t all manner of narrowne&s;s or har&s;hne&s;s in judging of others, &s;ince the Great, the Wi&s;e, and the Pious have in all ages

And in|deed the wrath of man will never work the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God. Per&s;ecution or ill u&s;age on account of matters of opinion are not the ways to &s;upport Truth; but have been invented and practi&s;ed merely to aggran|dize and &s;upport Parties and worldly intere&s;ts. To &s;ay, that the truths of religion are not able to &s;upport them|&s;elves upon a fair and candid examination, without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from &s;ecular power, is &s;aying, That they are not agreeable to rea&s;on, or that their evidence is not &s;ufficient, or that the author of our religion committed a mi&s;take in prohibiting his apo&s;tles and followers, as he every where does, ever to make u&s;e of force, or to apply to the &s;ecular arm. Upon the whole, it is my judgment, that young people ought to be taught, That there is no <HI>Here&s;y</HI> &s;o <HI>bad,</HI> nor &s;o <HI>contrary</HI> to the &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> as, to believe it to be proper or lawful to <HI>bate</HI> or <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> a fellow-creature and a brother, for an <HI>Opinion,</HI> which he declares, in the &s;implicity and &s;in|cerity of his heart, he had impartially <HI>examined,</HI> and thinks he finds to be <HI>agreeable</HI> to the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, taking it for granted, that the youth, to be in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian religion, has had his mind from the earlie&s;t dawnings of rea&s;on formed to the love of <HI>Truth</HI> for its own &s;ake, and to the <HI>gentle</HI> and <HI>tractable</HI> temper, which is nece&s;&s;ary for one, who would &s;ubmit to the obedience of good and &s;alutary <HI>Laws;</HI> taking it for granted, I &s;ay, that this has been done before the age of <HI>&s;ix,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;tep to be taken, is, in my opinion, to make him acquainted with the <HI>Chri&s;|tian Morality.</HI> The beauties of the Chri&s;tian di&s;po&s;itions of Humility, Meekne&s;s, Temperance, Benevolence, and the re&s;t, are obvious to the apprehen&s;ion of a <HI>Child:</HI> for a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, and of the excellencies of virtue and the deformities of vice, is what appears

He ought to be taught, that his everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s, and that of all men to whom Chri&s;tianity is known, depends upon his <HI>forming</HI> his mind and practice upon that perfect model.

<P>A per&s;on had better be uninformed, or un&s;ettled in his notions of any, or all other matters of &s;cience, than of <HI>Morality:</HI> for we are properly <HI>moral</HI> agents, and our everla&s;ting &s;tate is to be determined according to the eternal rules of moral Right and Wrong, as they &s;tand in the Divine mind.

<P>There is no young per&s;on, of a tolerable capacity, of the age of ten, or upwards, but may be led on gradually through a &s;cheme or view of natural and revealed religion from the fir&s;t principles of common &s;en&s;e in the following manner. Fir&s;t, No youth of that age is ignorant that God made him and all the world. Next, in order to give him &s;ome notion of the Supreme Being and his perfections, he may be ea&s;ily led to judge, that a Being who could make the va&s;t &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, the earth, which is &s;o great that there are many regions of it yet unknown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed natural for an In&s;tructor of youth to turn to a book of Geography, or put the youth in mind of what he has taught him of the greatne&s;s of the terraqueous globe.</NOTE>, and the &s;un, the planets, and fixed &s;tars, &s;o amazing di&s;tant from us and from one another<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">And here it would be proper to &s;hew him a general view of the magnitudes and di&s;tances of the heavenly bodies in any of the mo&s;t &s;imple and familiar Books of a&s;tronomy.</NOTE>, and all from nothing, mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e power. That he who has created &s;uch an endle&s;s variety of animate and inanimate creatures, all &s;o nicely fitted for their &s;everal u&s;es, that the more we examine, the more &s;kill, contrivance, and de&s;ign we find<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Decham's Phy&s;ice-theology, Nature di&s;play'd,</HI> &amp;c. will be proper to con&s;ult here.</NOTE>, mu&s;t be a Being of inconceivable wi&s;dom.

<PB N="34" REF="006294_0032_10285496277D5C18">Thus a youth may be convinced of three of the divine attributes, <HI>viz.</HI> infinite power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, almo&s;t by his bodily &s;en&s;es. The others he may by degrees be led to conceive of, as well as his years and capacity will admit. After this, it is natural to a&s;k him, whether he does not think, that he and all rea&s;onable creatures are obliged to &s;ome kind of &s;ervice and duty to the Creator and Governor of all things, upon whom all depend, and to whom all creatures are indebted for what|ever they enjoy or hope, and to whom they mu&s;t be ac|countable at la&s;t. Then he may be made to under&s;tand, that if he ought to love, honour, and obey his earthly parents, he ought much more to love, honour, and obey the great Father and Creator of both his parents and him|&s;elf, and of all mankind. That, if he ought to behave in the &s;ame manner to his in&s;tructors and teachers, he is much more &s;trongly bound to tho&s;e duties towards the God of wi&s;dom, to whom his in&s;tructors owe their capa|city to teach him, and to whom he him&s;elf owes his ca|pacity for improvement. That, if it is ba&s;e and wicked to the la&s;t degree to be forgetful of kindne&s;&s;es done him by men, who have it not in their power to do him any very great favours, it mu&s;t be infinitely more &s;o to be unthank|ful to him, to whom he owes his very being and all he enjoys. And la&s;tly, that, if it be extremely fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd for any one to di&s;obey or treat in a contemptuous manner a per&s;on in a &s;uperior &s;tation, who has it in his power to puni&s;h him, and who at the &s;ame time requires no obedience of him but what is ju&s;t and proper, and is more for his own than his &s;uperior's advantage, it is be|yond conception impious and ridiculous to refu&s;e obedi|ence to the &s;upreme Lord and Ruler of all things, who can cru&s;h or de&s;troy a world with a word, e&s;pecially &s;eeing the obedience he requires is in it&s;elf highly rea&s;onable, and tends to the advantage and improvement of his creatures, and is not required of them from mere arbitrary

<P>After this, it is proper to inform a youth, that God has communicated to us his will by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ent him into the world to give us a more perfect Rule and Direc|tory for our obedience than was ever known to mankind before, as well as to revive what moral knowledge through barbarity and vice was lo&s;t, and that therefore higher de|grees of &s;trictne&s;s and purity of life and manners will be required and expected of us, than of the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>To hear the Chri&s;tian religion recommended, to &s;ee the beauty and propriety of mo&s;t of its laws, and to let it pa&s;s without oppo&s;ing it, but at the &s;ame time without being in a rational manner convinced of its being truly of <HI>divine original,</HI> &s;uch a reception as this will never effectually en|gage any one to it, nor &s;ecure him from explaining away many very important parts both of a &s;ound belief and of a &s;trictly regular practice. But he, who receives and em|braces it, becau&s;e he has upon a thorough examination found it to bear the marks and characters of an appoint|ment of God, will not venture to trifle with any of either its doctrines or precepts, but will be &s;tedfa&s;t and unmove|able to the la&s;t, in the belief of the one and the practice of the other, in &s;pite of all the trivial objections and cavils of Dei&s;ts again&s;t its doctrines, or Libertines again&s;t its precepts. And he, who on rational grounds receives and embraces the Chri&s;tian religion, and in the &s;incerity and hone&s;ty of his heart de&s;ires to believe and under&s;tand it as it is in &s;cripture, without partiality for or again&s;t any par|ticular doctrines or opinions pretended to be revealed in it, and who earne&s;tly &s;trives to his utmo&s;t power to form his mind and regulate his practice according to its laws; &s;uch a per&s;on, without doubt, is not far from the kingdom of God. It is therefore my opinion, that neither mini&s;ters from their pulpits, nor tho&s;e who have the care of youth, can labour this point too much, nor employ too much
<PB N="36" REF="006294_0034_1028549AD3800120">time and pains in e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e committed to their charge in the rational and well-grounded <HI>belief</HI> of Chri&s;ti|anity, e&s;pecially in an age in which a &s;et of vain and &s;hal|low pretenders to wit or rea&s;oning are on all occa&s;ions endeavouring (unluckily enough indeed for them&s;elves) to &s;ap the foundations of it. We find in Scripture, that <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Belief</HI> is generally put for the whole of religion; and very ju&s;tly: for it is the foundation upon which the whole mu&s;t re&s;t, and wherever it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind of a per&s;on in its full &s;trength and evidence, it will influence and over-rule his whole conduct, and affect his whole character. And that the firm Belief of genuine Chri&s;tianity is the mo&s;t effectual means that can be imagined for ennobling and perfecting the human nature, is undeniably plain from comparing the character of the <HI>bulk</HI> of mankind in Heatheni&s;h countries, where the light of Chri&s;tianity has not &s;hone, and in popi&s;h, where it has been extingui&s;hed by error and &s;uper&s;tition, with the character of the bulk of the Chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t ages, who enjoyed it in its original purity, as they all &s;tand in hi&s;tory. And that the lives and characters of pretended Chri&s;tians in &s;ucceeding ages have come &s;hort of tho&s;e of the primitive times, is owing <HI>alone</HI> to the want of that &s;trong and &s;teddy <HI>belief</HI> of it in its <HI>original purity,</HI> which they had. For its natural effect and tendency has ever been and ever will be the &s;ame, and wherever it is un|der&s;tood and embraced as it was at fir&s;t delivered by its divine Author, it will produce its effect. And wherever it is fairly propo&s;ed, undi&s;gui&s;ed and uninjured by the <HI>inventions</HI> of men, with all its <HI>evidences</HI> and all its <HI>excel|lencies</HI> &s;et in a &s;trong and proper light, it will not fail to produce conviction in any teachable and unprejudiced mind. Whoever therefore has it in his power to do ju&s;|tice to the Chri&s;tian religion, and has opportunities of pro|moting the reception of it among mankind, which I am &s;ure, Parents and In&s;tructors of youth have, whoever has

<P>It does not appear to me, that there is any thing in all this above the capacity of mo&s;t youths of ten or twelve years of age and upwards; or that a youth of that age
<PB N="41" REF="006294_0039_102854A8C5993A40">is not as capable of &s;eeing the force of the&s;e arguments in &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity, when laid before him in a manner &s;uitable to his age, as a man of Forty. And the lea&s;t &s;mattering of any &s;ort of knowledge received in youthful years, while the mind is free and unprejudiced, the imagi|nation warm and lively, and the memory unburdened with a variety of &s;ubjects, is hardly to be conceived. Therefore, if any thing be worth learning, or under&s;tand|ing clearly and perfectly, it is of infinite advantage to begin the &s;tudy of it in the time of youth, rather than to put it off till riper years come on, with all their various cares, avocations and di&s;tractions.</P>
<P>What is wanting in this &s;hort and imperfect &s;ketch of a few of the evidences of Chri&s;tianity may abundantly be &s;upplied by the judgment of the parent or in&s;tructor with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few of the be&s;t books on the &s;ubject, as Grotius <HI>On the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> Locke'<HI>s Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, Dr.</HI> Clarke'<HI>s Evidences of revealed religion,</HI> in his book <HI>On the Being and Attri|butes of God,</HI> &amp;c. In which la&s;t mentioned ma&s;terly work there is a brief view of prophecy and its completions, which I would recommend to all, who have the care of youth, to give them &s;ome in&s;ight into, as it will prove an extremely delightful and in&s;tructing entertainment to them, and will confirm them mo&s;t powerfully in the belief of revelation. For who can entertain the lea&s;t doubt of the truth of a revelation, which &s;hews, by the exact com|pletion of its almo&s;t innumerable predictions, that it was given by One, who &s;oreknew what was to happen in the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages to come, of which completion every im|partial enquirer may be &s;atisfied, who will take the pains to compare the predictions with the events as they &s;tand recorded in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I will here add, for the u&s;e of Parents and In&s;tructors of youth, the following brief, but comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity, the ground work of which was
<PB N="42" REF="006294_0040_102854ADDDA65500">formed (for private u&s;e) by a gentleman, who&s;e writings on Divine &s;ubjects have given great plea&s;ure and improve|ment to many; but who&s;e primitive and exemplary piety and purity of life is his be&s;t and mo&s;t prevailing.

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible this view of the Chri&s;tian &s;cheme is rather proper for young people, who are arrived at &s;ome ripene&s;s of judgment, than for &s;uch who&s;e tender years render them unfit for rea&s;oming or judging of ab&s;tracted &s;ubjects. But I am convinced any parent or in&s;tructor of youth, endued with a tolerable gift of communicating, might, with a little explaining here and there, cau&s;e any youth of about
<PB N="46" REF="006294_0044_102854B84DF26F40">fifteen years of age to enter fully into all the parts of it. The advantages ari&s;ing from explaining and enlarging on the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture above quoted, and from warmly recommending and in&s;i&s;ting on the duties and di&s;po&s;itions above mentioned, are not to be conceived. Such me|thods frequently and diligently practi&s;ed can hardly fail (through the ble&s;&s;ing of God) to work the Chri&s;tian graces and virtues into the very &s;oul, and to mould and form the young and tender mind to that model of per|fection.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed work! Delightful ta&s;k! Heavenly employ|ment! Who would not rather de&s;ire to improve and en|noble a rational, immortal mind, which from the fir&s;t lay|ing of a foundation of virtae and religion in it, will be ever growing more and more perfect, advancing farther and farther in all that is truly great and worthy, and approach|ing more and more near to a re&s;emblance of its Creator, than to build a tower or a city, which from the day it is fini&s;hed, is every hour ha&s;tening to decay, and mu&s;t at la&s;t be involved and lo&s;t in the general and univer&s;al ruin of this world and all things upon it? Who would not rather de&s;ire to have the plea&s;ure to reflect on his death-bed, That he had had a con&s;iderable hand in directing one fellow creature to the way that leads to happine&s;s, and in prevailing on him to enter upon it, and keep &s;teddily to it, than, That he had for the &s;ake of his own glory or that of his king, involved thou&s;ands in mi&s;ery, &s;trew'd the fields with carnage, and laid wa&s;te the fair face of God's creation?</P>
<P>To fini&s;h what I intend to &s;ay upon a Method of in|&s;tructing, youth in the knowledge of revealed religion, I will &s;ubjoin the following general view of the whole body of Revelation, which, if explained and enlarged upon pro|perly, may &s;erve to lead young people, come to the years of fifteen or upwards, to form worthy and &s;ublime cor|ceptions of it and of its divine Author, and excite their

<P>It being obvious, that all young people ought to be taught to pray, there need be the le&s;s &s;aid on that head. They ought to be made to con&s;ider addre&s;&s;ing the &s;upreme Being as a duty nece&s;&s;arily incumbent on all finite rational ones, &s;eeing they all depend ab&s;olutely upon him. They ought to be taught to think of prayer as the mo&s;t awful and &s;erious duty of religion, and as an addre&s;s to the greate&s;t of Beings, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the very angels and arch|angels of heaven, compared with whom the kings of the earth are but worms, are &s;aid in &s;cripture to veil their faces, and to pro&s;trate them&s;elves before him. They ought by no means to be &s;uffered to u&s;e any words in prayer, which they do not under&s;tand, nor to &s;ay over con&s;tantly the &s;ame form by rote, which creates in them a contempt of that important exerci&s;e of religion, and makes it tedious and irk&s;ome to them; but &s;hould be furni&s;hed with variety of matter &s;uitable to their age and under|&s;tandings. And the prayers they u&s;e ought by no means to be of an immoderate length, a fault which the mo&s;t pious people are apt to deviate into; though one would wonder how they come to do &s;o, &s;ince there are in &s;crip|ture &s;o many expre&s;s cautions again&s;t it, and &s;ince the pat|tern &s;et by our Saviour him&s;elf is &s;o remarkably &s;hort, and all the others in &s;cripture are of a very moderate length.</P>
<P>They ought al&s;o to be properly prepared for partaking of the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, and taught to
<PB N="53" REF="006294_0051_102854CA8F0DCE38">con&s;ider it in its ju&s;t light, <HI>viz.</HI> As a Memorial of the Author of our religion, e&s;pecially of his death, as a public atte&s;tation of our being his di&s;ciples and followers, and as an evidence of our perfect love and benevolence for our fellow-Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected that on this occa&s;ion &s;ome|thing &s;hould be &s;aid on the &s;ubject of the female Educa|tion. But being unwilling to &s;well this little Tract a great deal beyond the &s;ize I originally intended it, I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s upon the head.</P>
<P>If the female part of our &s;pecies are as truly rational and accountable creatures as the male &s;ex, one would think, their being taught to &s;peak French, to write, or rather to &s;crawl, to work with a needle, to come into a room gen|teelly, to dre&s;s neatly, to &s;ing or touch a &s;pinnet &s;killfully, and to dance gracefully, &s;hould hardly be looked upon as and education &s;ufficient to qualify them for u&s;efulne&s;s in their proper &s;phere in this world, and for happine&s;s in the world to come. Nay, I &s;hould think it no difficult ta&s;k to prove, That every one of the above accompli&s;hments (as they are called) except that of writing, if it were done to the purpo&s;e, and handling their needle, may do them incomparably more prejudice than real &s;ervice, if they are not con&s;tantly kept in mind, That they are all trifling and contemptible in them&s;elves, &s;erving only as orna|ments or trappings, which may a little (and but a little) &s;et off the le&s;s con&s;picuous but infinitely more valuable beauties of the mind, to wit, Good-nature, Prudence, Virtue, and Religion: and that, where the&s;e internal beauties are wanting, the out&s;ide ornaments of the per&s;on &s;erve only to make the defect of real inward worth the more con&s;picuous. That young Ladies may in fact be with &s;ucce&s;s in&s;tructed in principles of virtue and maxims of prudence, and that they may be made to form very clear and rational conceptions of the doctrines of the Chri&s;tian religion, and to &s;ee the beauty of its precepts, is
<PB N="54" REF="006294_0052_102854CFE5DDC960">what I know to be practicable, becau&s;e I have &s;een the happy effects of &s;uch pious and worthy labours of both parents and teachers: and I hope there are many in|&s;tances of parents and teachers of young Ladies, who &s;ee their &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch methods, and re&s;olve to continue them.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, That it is of great con&s;equence to the youth of both &s;exes, that they be early led into a ju&s;t and rational way of thinking of things, and taught to be extremely cautious of judging according to outward appearances, or the &s;uperficial opinion of the multitude. Thus, for example, young ladies ought to be informed, That (contrary to the vulgar error) it is a woman's <HI>con|duct</HI> and <HI>behaviour,</HI> not her &s;hape and complexion, that determine her character and value. That it is the part of a woman of prudence and di&s;cretion to be&s;tow but very little thought on the ornaments of her body, and rather to endeavour after tho&s;e accompli&s;hments of the mind, which will hold out, and pre&s;erve the e&s;teem of her friends and the affection of her hu&s;band after the fading charms of her per&s;on are gone. That the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite beauty is odious, where the per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it &s;hews by her affected behaviour, that &s;he is con&s;cious of her own charms. That when a hand&s;om young woman views her&s;elf in a gla&s;s, or hears her beauty commended, pru|dence &s;hould direct her, in&s;tead of being puffed up with pride and &s;elf admiration, to reflect, that it is her bu&s;ine&s;s to take care that her mind be as well adorned with the Chri&s;tian graces and virtues as her face is by the exqui&s;ite hand of Nature with a ju&s;t mixture of the lily and the ro&s;e; to con&s;ider the &s;uperficial beauty &s;he and others ad|mire is every day drawing nearer to old age, wrinkles, and corruption; but that the beauties of her mind will &s;till be improving to all eternity; to remember, that how|ever amiable and delicate any human form may appear to the eye, there is nothing more mortifying than the con|&s;ideration
<PB N="55" REF="006294_0053_102854D2F6793C78">of the gro&s;s &s;ub&s;tances our bodies con&s;i&s;t of, and the many nau&s;eous and di&s;agreeable properties of them; and that if beauty is really in any degree valuable, it ought to fill the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it with gratitude to Him, who be&s;towed it, and in&s;pire her with the ambition of improving her mind &s;uitably, and &s;o become an object the mo&s;t compleatly amiable that the eye of man can be|hold, which I believe every one will own is, A woman who&s;e per&s;on is adorned with unaffected beauty, and her mind with Good-nature, Prudence, Virtue, and Religion. That a nice ta&s;te in dre&s;s is a <HI>blemi&s;h</HI> in&s;tead of an <HI>accomp|li&s;hment,</HI> becau&s;e it is a mark of &s;uperior &s;en&s;e to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> all trifling matters, and to be anxious only about things of con&s;equence. That a woman's having beauty enough to &s;trike as many coxcombs dead at a glance as could be contained in both Vauxhall and Ranelagh, could be no real advantage to her: but the having her mind endued with &s;uch amiable qualifications as will gain and &s;ecure the affection and e&s;teem of <HI>one</HI> man of &s;en&s;e for life, would be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; and that the de&s;ire of gaining a multitude of admirers, or of making conque&s;ts, is the very madne&s;s of folly. That flattering a woman for her beauty, and pretending to gain her favcur by that means, is more properly an <HI>affront</HI> than a compliment be|cau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es her &s;o extremely weak, as to be taken with <HI>flattery,</HI> which is the very food of fools, and with the prai&s;es of what &s;he does not owe to her&s;elf, but to na|ture, and with the prai&s;es too of the very meane&s;t ac|compli&s;hment a valuable woman is endued with, which is not worth commending in a per&s;on, who has any one other qualification to be taken notice of for. That the temptations and dangers, beauty expo&s;es a woman to, are more than all the advantages accruing to her from it, can make up for; and that it requires an uncommon mea&s;ure of prudence and caution in the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, to prevent one bad effect or other from it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="006294_0054_10282DCF36B21340">
Whenever a young lady arrives at the age of Twelve or Fourteen, it is high time to begin to in&s;truct her how to conduct her&s;elf with regard to the other &s;ex. I don't mean, To teach her how to &s;et off her affected and arti|ficial charms to the be&s;t advantage, and to practi&s;e a thou&s;and &s;tudied arts and api&s;h tricks to draw a &s;et of &s;u|perficial fops about her: it is both fooli&s;h and ba&s;e in a woman to put her&s;elf off for any thing el&s;e than what every woman, and every man is, <HI>viz.</HI> A creature full of infirmity and weakne&s;s, and who mu&s;t in many ca&s;es be forgiven and borne with. It is on this account, and by this means, that &s;o many marriages are unfortunate, which had not been &s;o, if the parties had been wi&s;e enough or hone&s;t enough to behave to one another like rational creatures before they came together.</P>
<P>It is therefore my opinion, that the youth of both &s;exes &s;hould be taught, That every thing in love-matters, ex|cept a rational, mode&s;t and cool inclination towards the mo&s;t happy and perfect &s;tate known on earth, I mean, of marriage, on account of its various advantages and, com|forts beyond a &s;ingle life, is contrary to the de&s;ign of Heaven in creating the &s;pecies in two &s;exes, and incon&s;i|&s;tent with the nature and pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind; and that all tho&s;e loo&s;e images, or romantic notions we have in plays, novels, and poems, which &s;erve either to inflame bea&s;tly de&s;ires, or at be&s;t to fill the imagination with rap|tures and exta&s;ies, which are altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the calm dignity of a decent behaviour in the marriage &s;tate, are to the la&s;t degree pernicious and mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>It is highly nece&s;&s;ary that young women be early in|&s;tructed both how to behave with regard to the hon|ourable lover and the crafty &s;educer. With the fir&s;t plainne&s;s and &s;incerity are all that is nece&s;&s;ary, and with the latter di&s;tance and &s;everity of behaviour; or, which is &s;till the more &s;ure way to be &s;afe, downright flight: for the true&s;t courage in temptation is &s;hewn by running
<PB N="57" REF="006294_0055_102854D92E220F00">away. They &s;hould be taught, That for a young woman to believe the flattering prote&s;tations of de&s;igning men, is to venture her <HI>all</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e, who have nothing to lo&s;e. They ought above all things to be every day and every hour cautioned again&s;t <HI>Flattery,</HI> which is always one prin|cipal art that is u&s;ed in the undoing of every young woman, that is undone. They ought to be forwarned, that every man, who per&s;i&s;ts in a &s;lavi&s;h attendance on a young woman, without making honourable propo&s;als to her, has certainly either a de&s;ign upon her virtue, or is a fool and incapable of any de&s;ign at all. And they ought to be led to con&s;ider every man, who pretends to love and admire them, and is all the while endeavouring to &s;educe them, in the &s;ame light as a wolf, who (if he had the gift of &s;peech) &s;hould earne&s;tly beg the favour of a lamb to come within the reach of his claws: for that he greatly admired his beauty and plumpne&s;s, and wi&s;hed to have the plea&s;ure of devouring him.</P>
<P>But there is no end of the u&s;eful and important le&s;&s;ons of prudence that might be taught young ladies, nor of the advantages they might gain by them. They &s;hould like|wife, as a powerful pre&s;ervative again&s;t the inordinate love of gaiety and plea&s;ure, be drawn, if po&s;&s;ible, to a love of reading, I don't mean plays, romances, or love poetry, which all tend to give their minds a wrong ca&s;t, and which they &s;hould be taught to de&s;pi&s;e for the fal&s;e, bomba&s;tic, and unnatural conceits they are generally &s;tuf|fed with: The reading that is mo&s;t proper for them (ab|&s;tracting from books on moral and divine &s;ubjects) is Hi&s;tory, and Biography, or the Lives of eminent men. Nor &s;hould they be &s;uffered to be ignorant of Geography. What has been already &s;aid on in&s;tructing the youth of the other &s;ex in the Chri&s;tian religion may, with a very little variation be applicable on this head.</P>
<P>If, after what has been recommended to Parents and In&s;tructors of youth for e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e under their care
<PB N="58" REF="006294_0056_102854DC10E19C08">in Morality and Chri&s;tianity, any thing were to be added with a view of rendering the pains they have be&s;towed the more effectual, I &s;hould think the following might be likely to an&s;wer very important ends, and properly crown the whole work. That before a youth removes from under the eye of his Parent or In&s;tructor, a Paper by way of letter be drawn up for his u&s;e by &s;uch parent or teacher, con&s;i&s;ting of,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An abridgment of the Maxims and le&s;|&s;ons of Prudence and Virtue that have been taught him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A brief view of the Doctrines and Precepts of Chri&s;|tianity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An ab&s;tract of the mo&s;t forcible and con|vincing Arguments for the truth of Chri&s;tianity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Some warm and pathetic Exhortations to endeavour after a &s;teddy and univer&s;al conformity to the laws of the Chri&s;|tian religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Cautions again&s;t the dangers incident to youth from the prevalence of Dei&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The danger to be &s;ure is not great, le&s;t tho&s;e profound philo&s;o|phers the modern Deifts &s;hould gain many pro&s;elytes, except among people of their own pitch of under&s;tanding. But youth, who have not had their belief of Chri&s;tianity eftabli&s;hed in a convincing manner upon a thorough knowledge of its evidences, are liable to be drawn a&s;ide by the mo&s;t wretched &s;ophi&s;try. They ought therefore to be forewarned and prepared for the cavils (poor and feeble as they are) of that un|happy &s;et of men, who rea&s;on as a per&s;on might be expected to do, who was born with the wrong &s;ide of his brain upwards; and may be &s;afely told, That the following are two or three of their mo&s;t formidable arguments again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion. <Q>That it can never &s;ignify much, whether mankind believe or reject the Chri&s;tian faith, if their practice be right.</Q> Which is much about as good &s;en&s;e as to &s;ay, It is no great matter, whether the mo&s;t effectual method that can be imagined, for compa&s;&s;ing a de&s;ign, be taken, &s;o the de&s;ign be com|pa&s;&s;ed, or That it does not much &s;ignify, in rai&s;ing a &s;tructure, whether a good foundation be laid or not, &s;o the &s;tructure be rai&s;ed. Again, That the light of Rea&s;on is "&s;ufficient for mankind, and that Revela|tion is of no manner of u&s;e, and therefore ought to be rejected." Which, &s;etting a&s;ide its being found by experience. That the light of Rea&s;on and Revelation both are not too much, is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as to &s;ay, The naked eye is &s;ufficient to &s;hew us, that there are planets in the &s;ky, and therefore Tele&s;copes are of no manner of u&s;e in a&s;tro|nomy, though they may &s;hew us many &s;urprizing phenomena in each of them, that never were thought of before the invention of that noble in&s;trument. <Q>That Morality is all, and therefore the rejection of a particular revelation can never be di&s;plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God.</Q> As if it was not as much an Immorality and as criminal in the &s;ight of God to oppo&s;e, or even to neglect what comes with all the characters, internal and external, of a revelation from Him, as to injure one's neighbour. <Q>That Chri&s;tianity cannot be a revelation from God, el&s;e it had been communicated with equal advantage to all mankind.</Q> Which is as good left-handed arguing, as to &s;ay, That Rea&s;on cannot be the gift of God, el&s;e it had been communicated with equal advan|tages to every Idiot as to Sir I&s;aac Newton.</NOTE>, from the &s;nares
<PB N="59" REF="006294_0057_102854DD969F9488">of plea&s;ure, honour, or riches, and from the infection of bad company.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Directions, in ca&s;e of a fatal defection from virtue and religion, how to recover and return again to the way of truth; and cautions again&s;t the too com|mon and de&s;tructive practice of putting off repentance till old age and a death-bed; and what other particulars may &s;eem to the di&s;cretion of every Parent or In&s;tructor of youth likely to be beneficial. This Letter, if I might advi&s;e, &s;hould be written with the hand of the parent, or per&s;on, who has had the care of the youth, and a promi&s;e de&s;ired of him, as a la&s;t and parting favour, That he would con&s;tantly, while he lived, continue to give it a fair read|ing a certain number of times every year; once a quar|ter or the like. I am per&s;uaded, that any thing written and given to a youth by a per&s;on, whom he formerly knew intimately, and was u&s;ed to think of with e&s;teem and love, mu&s;t to the la&s;t day of his life have a more powerful effect in keeping him &s;teddy to his duty, or in calling him back to it, in ca&s;e of a defection from it, than a much more elaborate compo&s;ition of a per&s;on, who was a &s;tranger to him, or who had written &s;uch a piece not immediately for his particular u&s;e. And, as to tho&s;e parents, who may not have the proper lei&s;ure or abilities they can but apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to any judicious per&s;on either of the clergy or laity, or which it is to be hoped there are every where numbers, who would gladly be em|ployed in &s;uch work.</ITEM>

Thus have I (my dear Countrymen) in the &s;incerity and hone&s;ty of a heart that de&s;ires no greater happine&s;s than an opportunity of doing you &s;ervice, laid before you a few incorrect and unpoli&s;hed, but, I hope, not improper or unnece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations on a &s;ubject, which truly &s;eems to me worthy, in this pre&s;ent age, of a much more &s;uf|ficient hand. If what is here publi&s;hed &s;hould give the hint to &s;uch an one, to do complete ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, it will give me a peculiar plea&s;ure. And if any per&s;on di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et the public right in any particular point I may have mi&s;led them in, will do it in the &s;ame &s;pirit of candour as the above was written in, he is &s;ure before|hand at lea&s;t of <HI>my</HI> thanks.</P>
<P>Methinks to Parents there &s;hould be no great occa&s;ion for any pathetic intreaties, to move them to diligence in endeavouring to promote the happine&s;s of their own offspring both here and hereafter; if the ties of natural affection do not engage them to their own fle&s;h and blood, it is not any thing I can &s;ay, that will be of any influence with them. Nor indeed will any arguments be of weight with tho&s;e In&s;tructors of youth, whom the terrors of a day of account will not move to endeavour to acquit them&s;elves faithfully. Some Parents there are, who, ei|ther from want of lei&s;ure, of a faculty of expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves, and communicating what they know, or of a pro|per education, are not in a capacity to be very u&s;eful to their children in the ways I have been recommending; but (as is already &s;aid) we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s the Divine providence that there are not many places in Britain where any parent, who is de&s;irous to have his children in&s;tructed in principles of Virtue and Religion, can be wholly at a lo&s;s for proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And, as it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, any per&s;on &s;hould take upon him the charge of in&s;tructing youth, who is not him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure a judge both of mo&s;t of the branches of human literature they ought to be in&s;tructed in, and likewi&s;e more e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="61" REF="006294_0059_102854E2D8397A20">of moral and divine matters, or, if there are, little do they think what a charge they undertake; if, I &s;ay, any &s;uch per&s;on neglects the in&s;truction of tho&s;e, who are under his care, in principles of Morality and Chri&s;tianity, or commits it to any other who, for ought he knows, may neglect it too, he will, I am afraid, be found one day without excu&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, having &s;aid what I thought would be pro|per on this occa&s;ion, to give me an opportunity of doing my be&s;t for your &s;ervice and advantage; what remains, I mean the &s;ucce&s;s of this weak attempt, mu&s;t be left to the grace of God, and to your willingne&s;s to li&s;ten to well-meant advice.</P>
