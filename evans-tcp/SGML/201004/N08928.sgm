<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS On &s;everal Acts of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE repre&s;entative body of this people having very fully and repeatedly remon&s;trated again&s;t the&s;e acts as uncon&s;titutional and as infringing the rights and privileges of the &s;ubject, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to add any thing upon that head; but we &s;hall confine our Remarks to &s;uch parts of the&s;e acts as affect the trading intere&s;t.</P>
<P>By the&s;e acts certain rates and duties are impo&s;ed on mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugars, wine, tea, gla&s;s, paper and many other articles, commonly imported into the Briti&s;h colonies in America, and &s;everal leading articles which procured remittances to Great-Britain are now either brought into the cla&s;s of enumerated articles, or &s;ubjected to the duty, ri&s;que and ex|pence of being landed in Great-Britain; which em|barra&s;sments on the trade of the colonies mu&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="011392_0003_0F86F267ED9F5240">
greatly dimini&s;h if not wholly de&s;troy &s;everal branches of it, and &s;o far le&s;&s;en the demand for Briti&s;h manufactures, great quantities of which are annually imported into this province, (more than the amount of our exports to Great-Britain) for the payment of which we depend not only upon what is produced among our&s;elves, but al&s;o upon what is caught out of the &s;ea, or is obtained by a circuity of commerce abroad. To collect this re|venue, the government is at a very great expence, equal at lea&s;t (and including the charge of men of war and cutters to guard the coa&s;t, va&s;tly &s;uperior) to all the revenue that could be collected, had our trade been as exten&s;ive as it was before tho&s;e Acts were made, which is not the ca&s;e now, and never will be, while they remain in force.</P>
<P>One principal branch of the trade of this province is the fi&s;hery, carried on to the banks, in which there are upwards of three hundred ve&s;&s;els employ'd, be&s;ides a great number of boats in the bay, and about ninety &s;ail in the mackrel fi&s;hery, the amount the fi&s;h the&s;e ve&s;&s;els cure, with the pickled fi&s;h and liver oil is upwards of <HI>one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds</HI> &s;terling per annum, about two fiths of the bank fi&s;h turns out merchantable, and is &s;ent to Spain, Portugal and Italy, and the nett Proceeds remitted to Great-Britain; the other three fifths being unfit for any market in Europe, is &s;ent with the pickled fi&s;h and mackrel to the i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies: And as the Engli&s;h i&s;lands do not con&s;ume more than is
<PB N="3" REF="011392_0004_0F86F268150633C0">
made by the boats in the bay, being about one fifth and one fourth of the mackrel and pickled fi&s;h, the remaining two fifths made by the bankers, together with three quarters of the mackrel and pickled fi&s;h is carried to the French and other foreign i&s;lands, in return for which we receive mola&s;&s;es, and &s;ome ordinary &s;ugars.&mdash;This valuable branch of our trade the fi&s;hery, almo&s;t, if not wholly depends on our trade to the foreign i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies&mdash;As we cannot cure fi&s;h for the European markets &s;epe|rate from the other &s;ort &s;ent there, and as we have no other market for what is made by the bankers, it will be lo&s;t if not &s;ent to the foreign i&s;lands, and this lo&s;s mu&s;t intirely de&s;troy the whole bank fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable branch of the trade of this province is lumber of all kinds, al&s;o provi&s;ions, hor&s;es and many other articles &s;uitable for the We&s;t-India markets, in which trade there are upwards of an hundred &amp; eighty ve&s;&s;els annually employed, mo&s;t of which make two voyages in a year; the&s;e ve&s;&s;els call fir&s;t at the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, and when they are &s;upplied, the remainder is carried to the foreign i&s;lands&mdash;A quantity of oak timber, &s;taves, and other lumber is &s;ent to Ireland, &s;ome to Madera and the We&s;tern I&s;lands, to purcha&s;e wines, and &s;ome few cargoes are &s;ent to Spain, Portugal and England, but none to any foreign port to the northward of Cape Fini&s;ter&mdash;The fir&s;t co&s;t of the&s;e cargoes of lumber being very &s;mall, the whole profits are not more than a bare freight for the ve&s;&s;els, but this
<PB N="4" REF="011392_0005_0F86F268E1F9F7B0">
freight is a great encouragement to &s;hip-building, which is another very con&s;iderable branch of trade in this province, wherein there have been upwards of three hundred &s;ail built in a year, before the late embarra&s;sments were laid on the trade, &s;ince which this number has been reduced at lea&s;t two thirds, and the trade&s;men formerly employ'd in this branch of bu&s;ine&s;s are now obliged to procure a livelihood in &s;ome manufacture, or &s;tarve&mdash;Some of the&s;e &s;hips went direct to Europe with fi&s;h, oil, pot and pearl a&s;h, naval &s;tores and lumber, but the greate&s;t part went to the We&s;t-Indies with lumber, fi&s;h and other articles of our produce, the proceeds of which, with the freights from thence to England, together with the ve&s;&s;els, were remitted to Great-Britain, to pay for the goods we received from thence&mdash;and by having timber plenty and building &s;o many ve&s;&s;els, we became carriers for other parts of America; be&s;ides the trade to the We&s;t-Indies many of our &s;hips formerly went to Virginia, North and South-Carolina, where they carried large quantities of rum to purcha&s;e rice, tobacco and naval &s;tores, and took in freight for Great-Britain, where the proceeds of the whole, (and indeed of all our trade) centers.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable branch of our trade is that carried on to Africa, where we &s;end large quantities of New-England rum, not only for our own trade, but to &s;upply the traders in &s;hips from Great-Britain, with whom we exchange this commodity for other European articles brought out by them &s;uitable for that trade, by means of which they are enabled to
<PB N="5" REF="011392_0006_0F86F26996A0BD68">
carry on their trade to greater advantage than they would otherwi&s;e do without this nece&s;&s;ary article&mdash; And as the &s;laves purcha&s;ed there, are chiefly &s;old in the We&s;t-Indies for bills on London, the proceeds of this trade con&s;equently are remitted to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;everal branches of trade are greatly ob&s;tructed by the duties impo&s;ed, and the re&s;tricti|ons to which they are &s;ubjected by the aforemen|tioned acts.&mdash;The duty on mola&s;&s;es, tho' reduced to one penny per gallon, which at fir&s;t &s;ight may ap|pear but &s;mall, yet as it is one tenth part of the va|lue (when brought to market) is really large, and will be a di&s;couragement to a trade which has in&s;i|nuated it&s;elf into, and is a great &s;pring to every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s among us. &mdash; The fi&s;hery, the lumber trade and &s;hip-building, are greatly promot|ed by the importation of mola&s;&s;es, and di&s;tilling it into rum, and the trade to Africa wholly depends on this article; &s;o that any act which hath a tendency to ob&s;truct the importation of mola&s;&s;es, mu&s;t be pre|judicial to Great-Britain.&mdash;The former acts impo&s;ing duties on mola&s;&s;es, were intended only as a regula|tion of trade, and to encourage our own i&s;lands; and the duty was only on foreign mola&s;&s;es: But by the&s;e acts, it is impo&s;ed on all mola&s;&s;es, and expre&s;ly for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue.</P>
<P>The duty of five &s;hillings per hundred on brown, and twenty-two &s;hillings on white &s;ugars, is a great burden on our trade to the foreign i&s;lands; if we
<PB N="6" REF="011392_0007_0F86F26A6D11BC28">
confine our&s;elves to mola&s;&s;es, a &s;ufficient return'd cargo cannot always be obtain'd; and the afore&s;aid duties upon &s;ugars are &s;o heavy as to render the im|port of them &s;o unprofitable, that we cannot pur&s;ue a trade by which we di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;uperfluous pro|duce of our country.</P>
<P>By the&s;e acts we are re&s;trained from exporting &s;ugars to a foreign market, without fir&s;t landing them in Great-Britain, or obtaining a licence from thence to carry them direct to a foreign market.&mdash;If we go fir&s;t to Great Britain and land them there, it will prove &s;o expen&s;ive by the delay and charges of un|loading &amp; re&s;hipping, &amp; al&s;o of a double freight and in&s;urance, that the trade cannot be carried on to any advantage, e&s;pecially in a time of war.&mdash;If we carry the&s;e &s;ugars direct to a foreign market by licence from Great-Britain, the difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments are &s;till greater, as the ve&s;&s;el in which any &s;ugars are to be &s;hipt, mu&s;t fir&s;t go to Great-Britain, and the ma&s;ter enter into bonds there, before a licence can be pro|cured, during which the &s;ugars are to remain in the King's &s;tores here, and after they are delivered in a foreign port, the ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t return to Great Britain to cancel the bonds, before &s;he can proceed on any other voyage&mdash;tho' the liberty granted to carry the&s;e &s;ugars directly to foreign ports by licence, might be intended as an encouragement to the trade, the re|gulations and re&s;trictions are &s;uch as will effectually defeat this very de&s;ign; whereas if we were allowed to export the&s;e &s;ugars (after being &s;tored here under the care of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers) to foreign markets
<PB N="7" REF="011392_0008_0F86F26B29C3C9A8">
in our own ve&s;&s;els, free of duty, it would encourage the bringing them here, and in time might become a very con&s;iderable branch of trade; and in particu|lar would enable us to employ our fi&s;h-&s;hips to bet|ter advantage, as they carry no fi&s;h between decks, and con&s;equently might be partly laden with &s;ugars. But under the pre&s;ent regulations, none will ever be bro't here in order to be exported to a foreign market in Europe, either in our own ve&s;&s;els or any other.</P>
<P>Here it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that &s;hould we be allowed the free importation of foreign &s;ugars even for our own con&s;umption, the trade of G. Britain would not be injured, but greatly benefitted; for in this ca&s;e, more of the &s;ugars made in the Engli&s;h i&s;lands might be carried to Great-Britain, and what they did not con&s;ume, would be exported from thence to foreign markets, which would employ a greater number of &s;hips, and thereby increa&s;e the commerce of Great-Britain, without le&s;&s;ening that of the Colonies&mdash;and all the &s;ugars we procured from the French i&s;lands, and carried to foreign mar|kets in Europe, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily le&s;&s;en their navigati|on, and increa&s;e that of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Formerly we made con&s;iderable remittances to Great-Britain with &s;ugars the produce of the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, which we received in return for our own pro|duce &s;old there: But by the Act of the 6th of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, we find &s;uch a di&s;tinction made in favor of ourfellow &s;ubjects in the i&s;lands, that while they may import Briti&s;h plantation &s;ugars into Great
<PB N="8" REF="011392_0009_0F86F26BEC26B430">
Britain <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> that which is imported from North-America mu&s;t be deemed <HI>French,</HI> by which means we are cut off from an article of export which hath been heretofore con&s;iderable, and might be &s;o &s;till, were it not for this regulation.</P>
<P>Logwood and mohogany have been by a circuity of trade the means of large remittances to Great-Britain&mdash;the&s;e we have obtained by &s;mall cargoes of provi&s;ions produced among our&s;elves, together with &s;ome Briti&s;h manufactures, by which many of our ve&s;&s;els have been employ'd; but now by being obliged to carry them fir&s;t to England, &s;uch heavy expences will be incurred by rea&s;on of their bulk, and the &s;mallne&s;s of their value, as mu&s;t put an end to this branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;equently the trade mu&s;t fall into the hands of foreigners.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons given for the&s;e regulations as men|tion'd in the act of the 6th of George the Third, were <Q>the more effectually to prevent enumerated goods being privately carried from the Briti&s;h co|lonies into foreign parts of Europe in ve&s;&s;els that clear'd out with non-enumerated goods; and al&s;o to prevent the clande&s;tine importation of foreign European goods into &s;aid Briti&s;h colonies.</Q> Upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e rea&s;ons we would ob&s;erve, that the great care and vigilance of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers here might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, and effectually pre|vent any &s;uch enumerated goods from being export|ed to foreign parts&mdash;With re&s;pect to the &s;econd, it is difficult to conceive how the obliging a ve&s;&s;el to
<PB N="9" REF="011392_0010_0F86F26CC5258528">
&s;top at England upon an outward-bound voyage, can have any influence in preventing the importation of illicit Goods upon her return, e&s;pecially when &s;uffi|cient care was before taken to prevent &s;uch illicit importation, by obliging all ve&s;&s;els that have any foreign goods on board to &s;top at Great-Britain on their return.</P>
<P>Another great embarra&s;sment to the trade of the colonies, is the multiplicity of bonds required by the afore&s;aid acts of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, in addition to the bond for enumerated goods, required by an act made in the 12th year of the reign of Charles the &s;econd, the condition of which bond is, that &s;uch enumerated goods &s;hall be landed either in G. Britain or &s;ome part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions; and by an act of the 4th of George the 3d, Coffee, Piemento, Cocoa, Hides, Skins, Pot and Pearl A&s;h, and &s;everal other articles are added to the li&s;t of enumerated goods&mdash;be&s;ides which, no ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el is allowed to take in any non-enumerated goods without fir&s;t giving another bond with one &s;urety; the condition of which is, that none of &s;aid non-enumerated goods &s;hall be landed in any port of Europe to the northward of Cape-Fini&s;tere, ex|cept in Great-Britain; by which we are excluded from carrying even non-enumerated goods to Ire|land, without fir&s;t calling at &s;ome port in G. Britain. If any iron, or lumber are laden on board any ve&s;&s;el, the ma&s;ter mu&s;t give a third bond, on the &s;ame con|dition as that required for non-enumerated goods; and in ca&s;e any rum is laden on board, a fourth
<PB N="10" REF="011392_0011_0F86F26D4BA37248">
bond is required, the condition of which is, that &s;uch rum &s;hall not be landed in the I&s;le of Man.</P>
<P>The&s;e bonds the officers of the cu&s;toms in this port require for all ve&s;&s;els loading any of the&s;e arti|cles, not only for &s;uch as are going to Europe, the We&s;t-Indies, and other colonies on the continent, but even for coa&s;ters going from one town to another in the &s;ame province, and &s;ometimes for ve&s;&s;els un|der twenty tons going to another town within the di&s;|trict of the &s;ame cu&s;tom-hou&s;e where the bonds are given; &s;o that no lumber can be brought from the place of its growth in the ea&s;tern parts of this pro|vince, to this or any other market for exportation, until &s;uch bond is given, though no cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer re&s;ide within 40 or 50 and &s;ometimes 100 miles of the place where the coa&s;ter takes in his lumber: This is a very great embarra&s;sment to the trade of this province, in which there are a great number of ve&s;&s;els employ'd in the coa&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s, and upwards of one thou&s;and &s;ail are annually en|ter'd and cleared at the &s;everal offices: This re&s;tric|tion appears the more unaccountable, as it is not known that one &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el ever carried a cargo of lumber to any foreign port to the northward of Cape-Fini|&s;tere; had &s;uch a trade formerly been carried on, the coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els are not capable of pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a voyage, and the charge of the&s;e bonds and certificates to cancel them, amount annually to a very large &s;um.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;everal bonds, every ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, even a coa&s;ter, is obliged to take out a &s;ufferance and cocket for every article
<PB N="11" REF="011392_0012_0F86F26E132A1120">
laden on board; and in ca&s;e he takes in any goods for which bond is required, he mu&s;t have a certifi|cate from the collector of his having given bond for tho&s;e articles; and in ca&s;e he neglects taking &s;uch certificate, not only the goods for which bonds are required, but even the ve&s;&s;el and the re&s;t of the cargo are forfeited; this has been &s;everely felt by &s;ome traders here, who have lo&s;t both ve&s;&s;el and cargo to a very con&s;iderable value, only for want of &s;uch certificate, tho' the cocket for tho&s;e goods mentioned that bonds were taken, but the certificate was either mi&s;laid or never delivered by the Collec|tor.&mdash;The &s;ureties in the&s;e bonds are likewi&s;e greatly expo&s;ed, &s;hould the ma&s;ter neglect to &s;end a certificate of the landing the goods for which he has given bonds, or &s;hould the collector refu&s;e or di&s;approve of the certificate he may &s;end, as being improper, (tho' there &s;hould be no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the goods were carried to any port they were exclud|ed from,) the &s;ureties may be pro&s;ecuted in the court of admiralty, and obliged to pay con&s;iderable co&s;ts at lea&s;t, if not the whole penalty, as has heretofore been experienced in that court, and is &s;uch an in|&s;upportable burden on trade, as will prevent many from engaging in it.</P>
<P>Before a cocket can be taken out for any goods, and &s;ome even of Briti&s;h manufacture, oath mu&s;t be made when, by whom, and in what ve&s;&s;el the article intended to be exported, was imported, this in many ca&s;es is impo&s;&s;ible, and will prevent &s;ome towns from being &s;upply'd with &s;uch goods as they want,
<PB N="12" REF="011392_0013_0F86F26EE6E60DB8">
and induce others to &s;et up manufactures of their own, and thereby le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of Briti&s;h manufactures in the colonies, which mu&s;t be &s;everely felt by the manufacturers in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Another great di&s;couragement to the trade of America is the unlimited power given to officers of the cu&s;toms&mdash;The act pa&s;&s;ed in the 4th year of George the 3d ordains, That in ca&s;e any informa|tion &s;hall be commenced and brought to tryal in America, on account of the &s;eizure of any &s;hip or goods as forfeited, wherein a verdict &s;hall be given for the claimer, the defendant if the judge certi|fies that there was a probable cau&s;e of &s;eizure, &s;hall not be intitled to any co&s;ts of &s;uit what&s;oever&mdash; and further in ca&s;e an action &s;hall be brought again&s;t any officer for &s;eizing any &s;hip or goods, where no information &s;hall be commenced, or brought to tryal to condemn the &s;ame, and a verdict &s;hall be given again&s;t the defendant, the plaintiff, be&s;ides his &s;hip or goods &s;o &s;eized, or the value thereof, &s;hall not be entitled to above two pence damages, nor to any co&s;t of &s;uit. But if the plaintiff &s;hall be non-&s;uited or di&s;continue his action, or if judg|ment &s;hall be given upon any verdict or demurrer again&s;t the plaintiff, the defendant &s;hall recover triple co&s;ts. By the&s;e clau&s;es in this act, and the power and extention of the courts of <HI>vice-admiralty,</HI> the whole trade of America lies at the mercy of the officers of the cu&s;toms and judge of &s;aid court, the former being impower'd to &s;eize the &s;hips or goods of the American merchants at their plea&s;ure;
<PB N="13" REF="011392_0014_0F86F26F99A83108">
and tho' they never pro&s;ecute the &s;ame, or act ever &s;o arbitrarily or unju&s;tly, the merchant has no re|medy, the officer not being &s;ubject to any damage, or even to co&s;t of &s;uit, while the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed claimant, tho' ever &s;o much injured, if he &s;hou'd be non-&s;uited or di&s;continue his action, mu&s;t pay triple co&s;ts. And as the Governor, as well as the officers of the cu&s;toms and judge of the admiralty, are intere&s;ted in tho&s;e &s;eizures, it is natural to conclude they will always encourage and promote the &s;ame; and many in&s;tances may be produced, where both ve&s;&s;el and goods have been condemned as forfeited, only for a &s;mall mi&s;take or neglect of the ma&s;ter, and the indu&s;trious trader thereby ruined, which &s;everities are not exerci&s;ed towards our fellow &s;ubjects in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Since the appointment of a board of commi&s;&s;io|ners to re&s;ide in America, the re&s;trictions and em|barra&s;sments on the trade have been greatly in|crea&s;ed by the attendance and delay in entering and clearing of ve&s;&s;els at the collector's office, where &s;ome ma&s;ters have been obliged to wait two or three days before they could obtain an entry or permit to unload; the many oaths and certificates required before any ve&s;&s;el can be cleared out have occa&s;ion'd the &s;ame delay to our outward-bound ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Another difficulty attending the entry of ve&s;&s;els, particularly from the We&s;t-Indies, is the ma&s;ter's being required to make an exact report of their car|goes on their fir&s;t arrival (even at any out-ports <PB N="14" REF="011392_0015_0F86F2704FCB4DF0">

<P>The merchants and traders in the northern colo|nies, and more particularly in this province, have been greatly abu&s;ed by the repre&s;entations that have been made to Great-Britain, of their importing large quantities of the manufactures of France, Holland,
<PB N="20" REF="011392_0021_0F86F274E7DC48E0">
Hambro' and other parts of Europe, in a clande&s;tine manner, which are fal&s;e and malicious; the mer|chants in this province carry on no trade with any part of France, except to their i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies; and no in&s;tance can be produced of any quantity of manufactures being bro't from thence. The goods imported from Holland and Hambro' are all enter'd in England, and the duties to a con&s;i|derable amount, annually are paid there&mdash;When the duty upon mola&s;&s;es was 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;terling a gallon, as there was no appropriation made of that duty, it was well known in England the officers of the cu&s;toms connived at the importation, and their conduct was not di&s;approved: How far this will ju&s;tify &s;uch re|pre&s;entations, is &s;ubmitted to the impartial public&mdash; but &s;ince the duty on mola&s;&s;es has been reduced, the whole, tho' grievous, has been regularly paid.</P>
<P>The merchants do not de&s;ire liberty to import any kind of goods that are prejudicial to the manufac|tures of Great-Britain, nor have they ever yet com|plain'd of their trade being confin'd to Great-Britain for &s;uch goods as are manufactured there, &s;o long as they might be imported duty free.</P>
<P>What the Coloni&s;ts have a right to expect and hope for, is a repeal of all the acts impo&s;ing duties on any kind of goods imported into the Briti&s;h colonies for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in America, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with their rights as free &s;ubjects&mdash;the removal of every unnece&s;&s;ary burden upon trade, and that it be re&s;tor'd to the &s;ame footing it was upon before the act of the 6th of George the 2d, commonly call'd the &s;ugar-act &mdash;particularly,</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="011392_0022_0F86F2758E5835F0" MS="y">That mela&s;&s;es &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to promote every branch of trade, and likewi&s;e &s;ugars, be admitted free of duty.</P>
<P>That the importation of wines from Madera and the Azores may be permitted agreable to the act of the 15th of Charles the 2d.</P>
<P>And as the free importation of fruit, wine and oil direct from Spain and Portugal would be a great encouragement of the fi&s;hery, and will no ways in|terfere with the manufactures of Great-Britain, and the obliging all ve&s;&s;els with tho&s;e articles on board to call at &s;ome port in Great-Britain, being attended with great expence and delay; and as the acid of of lemmons and oranges is become almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the health and comfort of the inhabitants of North-America, and the&s;e fruits not being able to endure repeated tran&s;portation, it is hoped the direct importation of wine, oil and fruit of all kinds may al&s;o be permitted.</P>
<P>The taking off the duties on paper, gla&s;s and colours, will relieve the trade of the burdens it labours under&mdash;But &s;hould all the revenue acts be repealed, and the trade reliev'd from all unne|ce&s;&s;ary re&s;trictions, and re&s;tor'd to the footing it was upon before the act of the 6th George 2d, and the indulgences now mentioned be granted, it would have a happy tendency to unite Great-Britain and her colonies on a la&s;ting foundation&mdash;all clan|de&s;tine trade would then cea&s;e&mdash;the great expence of men of war, cutters of the commi&s;&s;ioners and other cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers lately appointed, to &s;ecure the revenue, might be &s;aved&mdash;The trade, navigation and fi&s;hery would not only be revived, but greatly
<PB N="22" REF="011392_0023_0F86F2773745A498">
extended; and in that ca&s;e the growth of the&s;e colonies would be very rapid, and con&s;equently the demand for Briti&s;h manufactures proportionably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The foregoing Ob&s;ervations relate wholly to the revenue acts, and the conduct of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers; but we cannot conclude without mention|ing the great expence and needle&s;s trouble accruing to the trade by means of the <HI>Naval-Office.</HI></P>
<P>Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es, and the appointment of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, this office is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, and an&s;wers no valuable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this head it is proper to ob&s;erve, that &s;oon after the &s;ettlement of the&s;e colonies, the parliament thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome mea&s;ures for the regulation of the plantation trade. The act of the 12th of Charles the 2d for encouraging and increa|&s;ing &s;hipping and navigation, ordains what qualifi|cations &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for ve&s;&s;els trading to the colonies; and enjoins <HI>the Governor, or per&s;ons by him appointed,</HI> to in&s;pect and take care that the &s;ame be ob&s;erved, and to take bonds for all ve&s;&s;els lading any of the commodities in &s;aid act enumerated.</P>
<P>Three years after, by the act of the 15th of the &s;ame reign, further regulations and re&s;trictions were made, and every per&s;on or per&s;ons importing goods into the colonies obliged to deliver to <HI>the Governor of &s;uch colony, or to &s;uch per&s;on or officer as &s;hall be by him thereunto authorized or appointed,</HI> a true in|ventory of all &s;uch goods, &amp;c. At this time and until ten years after, no duties were laid by act of
<PB N="23" REF="011392_0024_0F86F277E6859E38">
parliament upon any commodities in the plantations, and of con&s;equence no cu&s;tom-hou&s;es had been erected, or collectors or other cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers appointed or thought of in the colonies, but the whole care and in&s;pection of trade remained with <HI>the Governor, or the per&s;on he appointed naval-officer</HI> &mdash;Afterwards by the act of the 25th of the &s;ame reign, chap. the 7th, &s;ect. 3. duties being laid on &s;ugars and &s;undry other articles, to be paid in the plantations, when carried from one plantation to another, the &s;everal duties &s;o impo&s;ed were to be levied and paid to &s;uch collector or other officer in &s;aid plantations as &s;hould thereafter be appointed by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms in England; who did accordingly appoint collectors and &s;uch other officers as occa&s;ion required, for that purpo&s;e, who ever &s;ince their appointment, it is well known, have had the chief care and in&s;pection of the trade.</P>
<P>From this account of the matter, it appears that as formerly there were no cu&s;tom-hou&s;es or cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers in America, the government thought proper to devolve the care and in&s;pection of the trade upon the <HI>Governor of each colony, or &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hould appoint under them for that purpo&s;e, who have been called naval-officers;</HI> that upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of cu&s;tom-hou&s;es and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a naval-office, or the appointment of naval officers was rendered altoge|ther needle&s;s. The original de&s;ign of government in the e&s;tabli&s;hment or appointment of either, was, that the trade might be duly taken care of and in|&s;pected,
<PB N="24" REF="011392_0025_0F86F27930B3F0F8">
that frauds might be prevented, and that abu&s;es in trade might be regulated: All the&s;e pur|po&s;es may be and are effectually an&s;wered by the appointment of collectors and other officers of the cu&s;toms; therefore the naval office is altogether u&s;ele&s;s. As it is a grievous burthen, and tends greatly to retard bu&s;ine&s;s, and is a needle&s;s expence, without any benefit to the government, or an&s;wering any one valuable purpo&s;e, we have ju&s;t grounds of complaint, and cannot but hope this office will be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the trade of America is really the trade of Great-Britain her&s;elf: The profits there|of center there. It is one grand &s;ource from whence money &s;o plentifully flows into the hands of the &s;everal manufacturers, and from thence into the coffers of landholders throughout the whole king|dom. It is in &s;hort the &s;tronge&s;t chain of con|nection between Britain and the Colonies, and the principal means whereby tho&s;e &s;ources of wealth and power have been and are &s;o u&s;e|ful and advantageous to her. The embarra&s;s|ments, difficulties and in&s;upportable burdens under which <HI>this trade</HI> has laboured, have already made us prudent, frugal and indu&s;trious, and &s;uch a &s;pirit in the Coloni&s;ts mu&s;t &s;oon, very &s;oon, enable them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the manufactures of Great-Britain, the trade of which, as well as its naval power, has been greatly promoted and &s;trengthened by the luxury of the colonies; con&s;equently any mea&s;ures that have a tendency to injure, ob&s;truct and dimini&s;h the American trade and navigation, mu&s;t have the &s;ame effect upon that of Great-Britain, and in all probability PROVE HER RUIN.</P>
