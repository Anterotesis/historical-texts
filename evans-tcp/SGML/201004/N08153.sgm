<HEAD>THE NECESSITY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the tax which has lately been laid on our American colonies is like to come under the review of parliament &s;ome time this &s;e&s;&s;ion, and as I lately arrived from North America, where I re&s;ided &s;everal years; I beg leave, with all dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to give you my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject. If I am &s;o happy as to ca&s;t any light upon a que&s;tion of &s;o much im|portance, I am certain of your approbation, and &s;hall have rendered the greate&s;t &s;ervice in my power to the public.</P>
<P>From the a&s;&s;iduous care of our pre&s;ent mini&s;try to re&s;tore commerce and &s;atisfaction to every branch of His Maje&s;ty's dominions, there is great rea&s;on to believe they will recommend a <HI>repeal,</HI> or at lea&s;t &s;ome con&s;iderable <HI>alterations</HI> of the American Stamp-Act; and as &s;ome weighty arguments now offer again&s;t that Act, which could not have been fore&s;een when it was made, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe the parliament in general will come into one or other of the&s;e mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010402_0003_0F7F74FC45CA6818">It is a pity that any who treat of American af|fairs, &s;hould ever handle them as if they had no de&s;ire to find out truth, nor any thing el&s;e in view, than to irritate or &s;tir up one part of His Maje&s;ty's dominions again&s;t another, by affecting to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of one, while they load the other with the mo&s;t opprobious language; as if it were po&s;&s;i|ble, that the intere&s;t of Great-Britain and her co|lonies could be &s;eparated, much le&s;s oppo&s;ite to one other: I have ever con&s;idered their connexion like that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the natural body and its members; if the members &s;uffer, the body mu&s;t &s;uffer al&s;o. For this rea&s;on, we &s;hould not barely con&s;ider how the Stamp-Act may affect our American colonies, but how it mu&s;t affect the fu|ture &s;trength and pro&s;perity of His Maje&s;ty's do|minions: And, pur&s;uing this plan, I hope to prove even to a demon&s;tration, That</P>
<P><HI>It is for the Intere&s;t of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>that the Stamp-Act &s;hould be repealed.</HI></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this proof, it is hardly nece&s;&s;a|ry for me to enquire what <HI>Right</HI> the parliament of Great Britain may have to tax our American colonies; e&s;pecially as the parliament has, at any time, the <HI>Power</HI> of re&s;olving that que&s;tion. Yet, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of our coloni&s;ts towards the Stamp-Act, it may not be improper to &s;hew, That they have at lea&s;t the <HI>Appearance</HI> of rea&s;on for their com|plaints.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="010402_0004_0F7F74FCF3106728">I. It is &s;aid, The colonies are under great obli|gations to Britain for the expence &s;he has been at, in planting and &s;upporting them; in particular, the blood and trea&s;ure we &s;pent, during the late war, on <HI>their account,</HI> has brought them greatly in our debt. Hence it is proper they &s;hould be taxed, to refund &s;ome part of tho&s;e expences.</P>
<P N="2">II. That a &s;tanding army is nece&s;&s;ary in the co|lonies, and it is proper they &s;hould be taxed for its &s;upport.</P>
<P N="3">III. That Great-Britain being involved in debt, and loaded with taxes, it is proper her colonies &s;hould &s;upport &s;ome &s;hare of the burthen. I &s;up|po&s;e one or other of the&s;e rea&s;ons, (for I have not read the Preamble to the Stamp-Act) induced the parliament to tax our colonies. They &s;hall be con&s;idered in order.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is a general opinion, that our North American colonies are greatly indebted to Britain for the ex|pence of planting them, and for the blood and trea&s;ure we have &s;pent, during the late war, <HI>on their account.</HI></P>
<P>Our coloni&s;ts are certainly indebted to the mo&s;t righteous prince that ever &s;wayed a &s;cepter, toge|ther with his royal ance&s;tors, for their enjoyment of every liberty, civil and religious, that might conduce to the pro&s;perity of any people.&mdash;And, in return, they have paid the mo&s;t affectionate loyalty, and have ever appeared ready to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of their blood, whenever His Maje&s;ty's ho|nor,
<PB N="6" REF="010402_0005_0F7F74FD6366AAF8">
or the &s;afety of his dominions, required their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: But as to pecuniary obligations between them and Great-Britain, I humbly pre&s;ume, the Ballance is in their favour.</P>
<P>There was a time when their fore-fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this ca&s;e, as well as when I &s;peak of the virtue, indu&s;try, or tem|perance of our coloni&s;ts; of the blood they have &s;pent during the late war; of their country producing all the nece&s;&s;aries of life; of the annual &s;um they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to pay by a Stamp Act, &amp;c. in general, when I &s;peak of our coloni&s;ts I mean tho&s;e on the con|tinent of America and not tho&s;e in our We&s;t Indian I&s;lands, as the latter are a perfect contra&s;t to the former.</NOTE> in Britain, being neither allowed to enjoy civil or re|ligious liberty, rather than re&s;i&s;t the powers that were, reque&s;ted that they might retreat into the wilderne&s;s of America, and were graciou&s;ly allow|ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a tract of land, which co&s;t Great-Britain nothing, and which was really the property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its native &s;avages: Thither they went, and at the expence of their own money and their own blood, &s;ubdued the natives, and convert|ed a wilderne&s;s into a fruitful country, which is now a valuable part of the Briti&s;h empire. Our parliament ever &s;ince &s;o conducted matters, by pro|hibitions and re&s;trictions on their trade, that the&s;e infant colonies alone have &s;erved the purpo&s;e of <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> our &s;ubjects, <HI>maintaining</HI> our poor, <HI>&s;trengthening</HI> our navy, <HI>con&s;uming our manufactures,</HI> and returning us the annual profit of immen&s;e &s;ums. Does it hence appear that they have con|tracted any debt with Great-Britain? While &s;ome of us were rolling in affluence and ea&s;e, others
<PB N="7" REF="010402_0006_0F7F750461D7F890">
wearing them&s;elves out with di&s;&s;ipation and vice, and thou&s;ands making a prey of one another; if their fathers, by a &s;ingular fortitude and virtue, bra|ved the fury of the &s;eas, and danger or death in every form, from famine and the &s;word, among wild bea&s;ts and &s;avages; if they have, by the mo&s;t arduous labour, changed that wilderne&s;s into a &s;ource of endle&s;s wealth to Great Britain, does it from thence follow, that they are under great obligati|ons to us? I &s;hould think the contrary. But the colonies are &s;aid to be greatly in our debt, for the blood and trea&s;ure we have &s;pent <HI>on their account,</HI> during the late war. Perhaps even this account is pretty well &s;ettled; but that we may form a pro|per judgment on this &s;ubject, which is &s;o often mentioned, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to review the cau&s;e and event of that war: The facts are the&s;e;&mdash; our Briti&s;h North American colonies are extended along the &s;hore near 2000 miles, and backwards not 200 miles, upon an average: The limits of the&s;e colonies are fixed by charter, and &s;everal of them are already full, though not very thick &s;et|tled. An immea&s;urable territory lies behind the&s;e colonies, which is not theirs, nor did they ever claim it; their charter gave them no preten&s;ions to &s;uch a claim: It is the territory of Great-Bri|tain, never yet located, nor granted to any parti|cular &s;ubject. It was natural to &s;uppo&s;e and ex|pect, that &s;oon as the bounds of her pre&s;ent colo|nies were all peopled, &s;he would al&s;o divide this
<PB N="8" REF="010402_0007_0F7F7504FB45F728">
wilderne&s;s into other colonies, which might be|come a new &s;ource of riches and power. But the French had perfidiou&s;ly &s;urrounded our pre&s;ent colonies by a chain of forts, and thereby mu&s;t have cut off all hopes of future increa&s;e to our domini|ons: in this ca&s;e it was the intere&s;t of Great-Bri|tain, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to remove the French; and removed they were, by a glori|ous and &s;ucce&s;sful conflict; but did the Britons a|lone bleed during that war, or did they alone bear the expence? No Sir, brave and generous as the Britons were, the Coloni&s;ts have not been a whit behind them.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle colony which was planted about 90 years ago, paid near half a million towards the ge|neral expence: the four New-England colonies a|lone rai&s;ed and &s;upported 20000 men <HI>per annum,</HI> and it appears from good evidence, that they lo&s;t near 30000 men during the &s;ervice. In general, this war has made &s;uch havock from one end to the other of our infant colonies, that the flower of their youth are de&s;troyed, and the &s;urvivors loaded with taxes, to pay the debts which were then contracted. In return for this profu&s;ion of blood, our coloni&s;ts have obtained the &s;ecurity of their pre&s;ent e&s;tates; they have al&s;o acquired per|petual honor to the Briti&s;h arms, and a va&s;t additi|on of empire to the kingdom, who&s;e &s;ubjects they are. But all the&s;e acqui&s;itions being chiefly imagi|nary, can never help them to pay greater taxes
<PB N="9" REF="010402_0008_0F7F7506B4DCB700">
than formerly; and I confe&s;s, it does not appear that they have made any other acqui&s;itions. It is true, that &s;everal French and Spani&s;h colonies are added to our dominions upon the continent, to|gether with a va&s;t extent of wilderne&s;s, but that is nothing to the pre&s;ent coloni&s;ts: their land is <HI>de|crea&s;ed,</HI> and not increa&s;ed in value by the&s;e additi|ons, and their trade is <HI>wor&s;e</HI> in&s;tead of better; for the more land is to be purcha&s;ed on the continent, &s;o much the le&s;s will any purcha&s;er give for what is now occupied, the greater po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions we have on the continent of North America, and the grea|ter quantity of indigo, rice, tobacco, hemp, flax, furr, and timber that are thence imported, &s;o much le&s;s mu&s;t each colony gain by her trade in the&s;e arti|cles, and the&s;e are the commodities with which they pay their taxes. Who then have been gainers by our late war in America? The an&s;wer is plain, Great Britain has gained exceedingly.</P>
<P>It is long &s;ince the neat balance of trade with our colonies was <HI>half a million</HI> per annum in fa|vour of Great Britain, and by our late acqui&s;itions in America, it mu&s;t &s;oon become <HI>a million,</HI> I ap|prehend this is more than we gain by our trade in every other part of the world. Thus it appears that &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure was &s;pent during the late war, on the account, almo&s;t <HI>the &s;ole ac|count of Great Britain,</HI> and not of the colonies. And whoever con&s;iders the coloni&s;ts in a ju&s;t point of view, will confe&s;s they have done more than
<PB N="10" REF="010402_0009_0F7F750754BDE408">
could have been expected, as they really have done more than was ever required towards the &s;up|port of the late war.</P>
<P>Every new acqui&s;ition on the continent, mu&s;t be entirely &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of Great Britain, as our American coloni&s;ts always have been. The&s;e people are in general hardy, temperate and indu&s;trious, hence they have already opened an immen&s;e trade, the Profits of which, every &s;hil|ling, centers in this I&s;land. As their country pro|duces every thing in abundance that is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of life, they might carry on a profitable trade at any foreign market. But this is not proper, nor is it permitted; our parliaments have &s;o hedged them in with laws, re&s;trictions, and prohibitions, that by their utmo&s;t indu&s;try, they can hardly pay their debts; furr is a valuable article, and a trade in hats would have been highly profitable for them; to prevent this, we have pro|hibited their &s;ending hats even from one colony to another. This is the ca&s;e of wool, and other ar|ticles of like con&s;equence. Copper mines they have in abundance, but we have taken care, by proper regulations, to reap the chief profits ari&s;ing from them; their hou&s;es are univer&s;ally covered with wood, almo&s;t in the &s;hape of flat tiles, hence they have an extraordinary con&s;umption of nails, but we do not indulge them in the u&s;e of &s;litting mills, le&s;t they &s;hould make nails for them&s;elves, and thereby hurt our manufacture. I need
<PB N="11" REF="010402_0010_0F7F7507EF3910C8">
hardly mention that they are not allowed to u&s;e any foreign manufacture, but as it comes thro' our hands, encrea&s;ed in price by public duties, and the private gain of our merchants, by which means they pay us a pretty heavy tax. Nor need I men|tion that there are numberle&s;s articles, the produce of their country, which they are not allowed to &s;end even to Great Britain, on any account, le&s;t they &s;hould hurt the price of like commodities in this i&s;land. It would be tedious to mention the &s;e|veral re&s;trictions we have laid on their trade, re|&s;trictions neverthele&s;s, which the Americans can ea&s;ily bear, as they are only negative, yet the trade of this i&s;land could not have flouri&s;hed if they had been neglected. Thus we have always been able to convert the indu&s;try and trade of our coloni&s;ts into the riches and &s;trength of their mother coun|try. Now, Sir, as it is plain that our colonies in North America have hitherto &s;erved us, or rather they have been taxed by us, to the value of half a million per annum, that they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted us at the expence of much blood and trea&s;ure to acquire new colonies, by which <HI>we alone</HI> are to be profited, it &s;eems cruel to make them &s;uffer again for our advantage, by compelling them to refund our ex|pences in the war.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is further &s;aid, that <HI>a &s;tanding army &s;hould be &s;tationed in our colonies, and they &s;hould be taxed for its &s;upport.</HI> But I confe&s;s it does not appear to me why we &s;hould tax our Engli&s;h colonies in
<PB N="12" REF="010402_0011_0F7F7508A3B5C110">
North America, for the &s;upport of a &s;tanding army; for this army is to be &s;tationed there either on ac|count of the Engli&s;h colonies, or on account of the French and Spani&s;h ones, which we have late|ly conquered; it is evidently improper that our Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts &s;hould be taxed for the &s;upport of an army which is de&s;igned to keep other co|lonies in &s;ubjection. I have heard an old maxim which &s;eems founded on ju&s;tice, viz. <HI>He that reaps the profit &s;hould al&s;o bear the expence,</HI> or to this purpo&s;e, and certainly this maxim may very pro|perly be applied to the ca&s;e in hand. Why &s;hould the Engli&s;h North Americans &s;upport an army to be &s;tationed in Canada, or Pen&s;acola and Mobille, any more than an army which is &s;tationed in our other new conque&s;ts on the coa&s;ts of Guinea? for by the latter they gain more than by the former, and &s;urely their having &s;pent much blood and trea|&s;ure in conquering tho&s;e colonies, and adding them to the Briti&s;h dominion, can never be urged as a rea&s;on for their &s;pending all the trea&s;ure they have, or rather all they ever &s;hall have, in pre&s;erving them. It appears equally improper for us to tax our Engli&s;h North American colonies for the &s;up|port of an army to be &s;tationed among them&s;elves; becau&s;e &s;uch an army is no way nece&s;&s;ary there, but, on the contrary, mu&s;t prove very injurious. If a &s;tanding force be nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e colonies, it mu&s;t be for the purpo&s;es of the civil magi&s;trate, <HI>viz.</HI> pre&s;erving peace, and executing ju&s;tice. But
<PB N="13" REF="010402_0012_0F7F750991A3CAF8">
as our &s;everal colonies have a compleat legi&s;lature, &s;ubordinate to that of Great-Britain, which has a power of forming militias, rai&s;ing troops, &amp;c. and as they ought to be the be&s;t judges of their own wants, it would &s;eem natural to leave the affair of regular troops to their own option, to be rai&s;ed and paid as they &s;hall find mo&s;t convenient, or not to be rai&s;ed at all, unle&s;s it be requi&s;ite.&mdash;A few there have been, &s;o little acquainted with the true &s;tate of our American colonies, as to &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;tanding army is nece&s;&s;ary there, even to pre&s;erve the obedience of our Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to the crown of Great-Britain; but nothing can argue greater ignorance, as our coloni&s;ts have hitherto appeared the mo&s;t loyal of all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and no man can be &s;o wicked as to &s;uppo&s;e that our mi|ni&s;try will ever premeditate &s;uch &s;chemes of op|pre&s;&s;ion as may &s;hake that loyalty, and enable him to fore&s;ee that troops may be nece&s;&s;ary. Whoever recollects that our colonies were in general planted by people who fled from England and Scotland, to e&s;cape the civil and religious per&s;ecution of a for|mer family, which God in mercy to this nation has bani&s;hed, may &s;ee an obvious rea&s;on why the&s;e coloni&s;ts &s;hould continue inviolably and regularly attached to His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and his illu&s;trious family.&mdash;But we need not inquire into cau&s;es, while modern facts give ample te&s;timony to this truth po&s;terity will hardly believe, concerning our coloni&s;ts, that when danger was far enough from
<PB N="14" REF="010402_0013_0F7F750A2E8D1D40">
their borders, and &s;o many of their youth de&s;troy|ed in battle, that volunteers were not to be rai&s;ed by any means; rather than the progre&s;s of His Maje&s;ty's arms &s;hould be retarded, they made laws to impre&s;s their &s;ons and brethren by thou&s;ands in|to the &s;ervice. This was always done upon the fir&s;t notice of His Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, &s;ignified by &s;ome mini&s;ter of State: and if this people's loyalty may yet be &s;u&s;pected, there never can any confi|dence be placed in &s;ubjects; &s;ince hitherto every appearance of loyalty has certainly been in favour of the coloni&s;ts. If a &s;tanding army &s;hould un|fortunately be quartered among our Engli&s;h colo|nies in North America, it will prove the cau&s;e of a double tax, the mo&s;t grievous of which has been little attended to.</P>
<P>Our coloni&s;ts can only flouri&s;h by indu&s;try, tem|perance, and frugality, the moment they for&s;ake the&s;e virtues, they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be profitable ei|ther to them&s;elves or Great Britain; an ancient kingdom that has an e&s;tabli&s;hed commerce may &s;u&s;tain a little vanity, yet the mo&s;t opulent king|doms have at length been cru&s;hed under this weight, and Britain her&s;elf is &s;en&s;ibly injured by her di&s;&s;ipated &s;ons; what mu&s;t become of an in|fant colony that has no trade but with Great-Britain, and is obliged to pay the balance, which is always again&s;t her, by an extraordinary &s;hare of diligence. If the inhabitants of this colony &s;hould be corrupted in their morals, if they &s;hould learn
<PB N="15" REF="010402_0014_0F7F750B09242A08">
di&s;&s;ipation and idlene&s;s from an army that has no|thing to do, if their &s;ons and daughters &s;hould be|come le&s;s frugal or le&s;s cha&s;te by the conver&s;ation of men born to affluence, accu&s;tomed to the vices of an old country and trained up in the army, I fear, if &s;uch things &s;hould happen to an infant co|lony, mu&s;t not population be retarded, and the in|habitants &s;oon become unable to pay their debts, and thence u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubjects to Great Britain?</P>
<P>The third rea&s;on that I have heard given for the Stamp-act, &s;hall now be con&s;idered, viz. <HI>Great Britain being involved in debt, and loaded with taxes, it is proper her colonies &s;hould &s;upport &s;ome &s;hare of the Burthen.</HI> As this rea&s;on has the greate&s;t air of propriety, and doubtle&s;s had &s;ome influence on our late mini&s;try, I &s;hall take the more notice of it, e&s;pecially as an an&s;wer to it brings me to the chief purpo&s;e of this letter, and what I pro|po&s;ed at the fir&s;t to demon&s;trate, which was this. <HI>It is for the intere&s;t of Great-Britain that the Stamp-act in North America be repealed.</HI> If I &s;hould be able to prove this, every other ar|gument would be immediately an&s;wered, for there might chance to be a ca&s;e in which it would be cruel and unju&s;t for us to tax a colony, even tho' we could be profited thereby, yet certainly, if that very tax were <HI>injurious</HI> to our&s;elves, it would be on every account wrong to e&s;tabli&s;h it. And howe|ver our nation may be loaded with debt, if the Stamp-act &s;hould prove injurious to Great Britain,
<PB N="16" REF="010402_0015_0F7F750BAC7FA5B8">
<HI>it mu&s;t increa&s;e and not dimini&s;h the burden.</HI> With|out looking forward to a great di&s;tance, and men|tioning every probable con&s;equence of the Ameri|can Stamp-act, it mu&s;t immediately injure Great Britain, by hurting her trade with the colonies: the extent of this injury we &s;hall pre&s;ently con&s;ider. There are two ways by which our trade with the colonies may be affected. The coloni&s;ts may prove <HI>unwilling</HI> or <HI>unable</HI> to &s;upport this trade; in either ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be ruined; and <HI>both</HI> are like to be the con&s;equence of a Stamp-act. It has never been counted either for the honor or intere&s;t of any legi&s;lature to grieve the &s;ubject, it is gene|rally hurtful, and &s;ometimes dangerous to grieve them univer&s;ally, and probably no act ever created &s;uch univer&s;al di&s;quiet as the Stamp-act does in America. It is vain to &s;ay that any danger can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e at pre&s;ent from our coloni&s;ts endea|vouring to re&s;i&s;t the Stamp-act by force, they are neither able nor de&s;irous to contend with their mother-country, they know that we have troops enough on the continent to vex them, and could &s;oon vi&s;it them with a fleet that might blow them to atoms, nor does it appear that one per&s;on of note in the colonies ever thought of re&s;i&s;tance, tho' &s;ome people, ever plea&s;ed with calumnly and mi&s;|chief, would fondly con&s;true &s;ome rude efforts of the common people into premeditated rebellion, in order to exa&s;perate our government again&s;t the unfortunate coloni&s;ts, with the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect
<PB N="17" REF="010402_0016_0F7F750C635C46D0">
of &s;eeing our hands imbrued in the blood of our children.

with the &s;word, and the re&s;t worn out with hard&s;hips are gone to &s;leep; that if their chil|dren &s;hould now be deprived of tho&s;e privileges, po&s;terity will be cautious how they encounter dan|gers to aggrandize the Briti&s;h nation.&mdash;Unhappy coloni&s;ts! de&s;tined to misfortunes at all events: if they are not vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful, they mu&s;t peri&s;h by famine or the &s;word; if they are &s;uc|ce&s;sful and pro&s;perous, they mu&s;t be taxed beyond the utmo&s;t farthing, by men in a di&s;tant part of the world. It may be replied, that the colonies did not all obtain by charter the exclu&s;ive privi|lege of taxing them&s;elves: but they &s;ay, it would not follow that the parliament of Great-Britain had a right to tax them; on the contrary, though their charters did not &s;ecure this privilege to them, it would be improper for the parliament to take that advantage.

<P>Doubtle&s;s, any attempts appearing from any American charter to deprive the &s;ubject of con&s;ti|tutional privileges, will ever be deemed unju&s;t by a Briti&s;h parliament: perhaps no &s;uch attempts have been made. I am not perfectly acquainted with all the charters; but it was proper to mention the circum&s;tance, as &s;ome of the&s;e charters were grant|ed by a family that was apt to de&s;pi&s;e the privi|leges of the &s;ubject. I believe that a Briti&s;h King may di&s;pen&s;e with &s;ome obligations in the &s;ubjects, but cannot enjoin any that are repugnant to our <HI>Magna Charta</HI>&mdash;however that be, the coloni&s;ts &s;ay, they de&s;ire no di&s;pen&s;ations, nor any liberties greater than their fellow &s;ubjects in Great Britain, to be taxed by their own repre&s;entatives, <HI>and only by them,</HI> a privilege which nature, or rather God and nature has granted them, though they had no Charter; that depriving them of this privilege would be a cruel precedent; and by the way, it may have trouble&s;ome con&s;equences. To eluci|date this matter, let us &s;uppo&s;e it a &s;ettled rule, that the Briti&s;h parliament is ever to tax our Ame|rican plantations, let us carry this rule forward a few years, and &s;ee how it mu&s;t apply.</P>

Let us &s;uppo&s;e them only to double in twenty years, then in &s;o &s;hort a time as forty years they mu&s;t be eight millions, and twenty years more, perhaps twenty five years will make them &s;ixteen millions. The inhabitants of Great Britain are hardly &s;even millions, and we don't increa&s;e, except that our commerce with North America has lately encrea&s;ed our numbers. Now I &s;hould be plea&s;ed to hear by what face of ju&s;tice the &s;maller part of the Briti&s;h empire &s;hall tax the greater; how the re|pre&s;entatives of &s;even millions &s;hall undertake to tax &s;ixteen millions, whom they do not repre&s;ent.

The maxim in Great Britain, that a &s;ub|ject &s;hould only be taxed by his own repre&s;enta|tives, is evidently founded on ju&s;tice, for when we are taxed by our repre&s;entatives, in other words, when we are taxed by our&s;elves, we can have no temptation to go beyond what is rea&s;onable or nece&s;&s;ary, we know our own wants, and feel our own Burthen, and the&s;e mu&s;t ever be the rule of taxation; but a Briti&s;h parliament will hardly be allowed to feel for the Inhabitants of North Ame|rica, we are ignorant of their abilities, or the &s;mall knowledge we have, is founded on very &s;uperfi|cial accounts, often fal&s;e ones.

hope to prove this impo&s;&s;ible, but if it &s;hould hap|pen, the temptation would be dangerous.

<P>Did not the brave inhabitants of this i&s;land complain with a voice that &s;hook the ba&s;is of our government, when they where taxed at the &s;ole plea&s;ure of their &s;overeign, and can the thing be right in America, which was wrong in Great-Britain? Or can that be right on one &s;ide the Atlantic which was wrong on the other? The Americans indeed are not taxed by the royal pre|rogative, but they are taxed by a p&mdash;t which they have not cho&s;en, nor have they con&s;ented to be taxed by them; and if they are taxed without and again&s;t their own con&s;ent, they do not &s;ee where the difference is, whether that tax be laid by the K&mdash; or by the p&mdash;t.</P>
<P>Whether the coloni&s;ts rea&s;on well or ill upon this &s;ubject, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to determine; I have only to mention facts.

think we oppre&s;s them; they will never treat us with the re&s;pect due to a parent, while they think we treat them as &s;laves; nor will they carry on a friendly and profitable trade with us, while they think we treat them as aliens, and load them with chains. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I think it is our intere&s;t to repeal the Stamp-Act, rather that grieve &s;o many good &s;ubjects, and cut off the &s;ource of our own wealth. But if any per&s;on &s;hould think the foregoing rea&s;ons are not conclu&s;ive, or that the bad effects of this act upon trade will be trifling and pre&s;ently forgotten, there is another rea&s;on, which I hope will appear demon&s;trable: though the Americans &s;hould be willing, they will not be able to &s;upport their trade as formerly with Great-Britain, while the Stamp-Act continues in force. Various are the accounts of how much the act may produce yearly from our Engli&s;h colonies on the continent of America; perhaps it may bring us 200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum;</HI> but it does not by any means follow, that Great-Britain &s;hall reap the neat profit of 200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum</HI> more than &s;he formerly gained by her colonies; on the contrary, I apprehend &s;he may be a lo&s;er of pretty near that &s;um. To a&s;certain this matter, it is proper to ex|amine all the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the Stamp-Act, and we find the weight of the act con&s;piring with the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to injure our trade. The weight of the tax gives it a &s;troke which the Americans them&s;elves cannot prevent.

It is expre&s;ly provided, that the money to be rai&s;ed by the Stamp-Act, &s;hall be all remitted to Great-Britain in Gold or Silver only: now as the &s;um to be rai&s;ed yearly is more than all the money now in the colonies; and as it will be difficult for them to find money enough the next year even to pay their taxes; it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be able, at the &s;ame time, to &s;end over large &s;ums to our merchants for Engli&s;h goods.</P>

for many ages. The colonies produce all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, and would produce all its luxuries with a little care, the inhabitants have hitherto neglected all &s;orts of manufacture, turning their chief Attention to hu&s;bandry. Thus, with wheat, rice, indigo, tobacco, hemp, timber, &amp;c. they paid mo&s;t of their debts. While they con&s;umed our manufactures, their way of living was perfectly &s;uited to our intere&s;t, who live by trade and ma|nufactures, it was al&s;o &s;uited to their convenience, hence they would have continued in this tract, for as they are accu&s;tomed to Hu&s;bandry, and from our New acqui&s;itions may &s;u&s;tain land enough for that purpo&s;e, and as hu&s;bandry is the natural em|ployment of all infant countries, nothing but the pre&s;ent violent nece&s;&s;ity, could have turned their attention to manufactures, thus in a few years they would have required more Engli&s;h Goods than all we make at pre&s;ent in this i&s;land. The dream is plea&s;ing, but it is like to be more than a dream, for the Stamp-act with the addition of a few Cutters, have done more in one year to promote American manufactures, than the natural progre&s;s of arts with all the additional arguments of frugality would have produced in an hundred years; not that our coloni&s;ts have already felt the iron hand of nece&s;&s;ity, but they &s;ee a Stamp-Act coming from a quarter whence they thought it could not come, perhaps another act may come clo&s;e at its heels, at this rate it is time for them to <HI>make</HI> tho&s;e articles

<P>The balance of trade, as was already ob&s;erved, between us and our American colonies (excluding our conque&s;ts) is computed to be more than half a milion <HI>per ann.</HI> in our favour; by this means a|lone we us'd to get <HI>all the money</HI> that our coloni&s;ts had, and if they &s;hould ever get more money, we were &s;ure to get that al&s;o; for proof of this I ap|peal to facts. The Americans always ow'd our merchants greater &s;ums than all the current money in their country would pay; and tho', during the late war, &s;everal millions were &s;ent thither to pay the expences of our troops, the coloni&s;ts did not retain that money, for as money increa&s;ed their commi&s;&s;ions increa&s;ed, &s;o that towards the end of the war they con&s;umed eight or nine hundred thou|&s;and pounds worth of Engli&s;h goods more than at the beginning, and at the peace they were three times as much in our debt as they had been ten years before that, nor had they money enough

then to pay the third part of that debt. As it is evident that the profits of our trade alone mu&s;t have continued to bring us <HI>all the money</HI> our co|loni&s;ts &s;hould ever po&s;&s;e&s;s, I don't &s;ee how the Stamp Act can po&s;&s;ibly bring us <HI>more,</HI> &s;ince the Americans are not able to coin money as our de|mands increa&s;e, nor are they like a certain tree which is &s;aid to grow &s;tronger by heavy burthens; the con&s;equence is plain, the more we receive for &s;tamps, the le&s;s we &s;hall receive for other manu|factures. Let us now examine whether it be more profitable for Great Britain to receive two hundred and even three hundred thou&s;and pounds annually by way of tax, or to receive it as the neat profit of trade with a di&s;tant country.
