<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the earne&s;t reque&s;t of many enquiring minds, I have undertaken to pre&s;ent to the publick, the mat|ter, form and manner of a new and &s;trange religion, that has lately taken place among many people in the States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and of New-York; and in pur&s;uing my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take the following method.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I will pre&s;ent to view, the leaders and teachers of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will &s;hew their manner of addre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. I will &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evi|dence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I will &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="5">V. I &s;hall &s;hew the directions which they give to tho&s;e that come to them, to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I will &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructi|ons on their adherents.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I &s;hall &s;hew what this new religion is, us pointed out by &s;cripture te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. I &s;hall give &s;ome rea&s;ons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere &s;peculation, but by &s;orrow|ful experience.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I &s;hall clo&s;e the whole by a word of advice to mi|ni&s;ters and people.</P>
<P>To return therefore according to my promi&s;e, in the fir&s;t place to pre&s;ent to publick view, the leaders and teachers of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P>The whole number con&s;i&s;ts of five males and &s;even fe|males; three of the males, and two females, profe&s;s to be perfect, or to have attained a &s;tate of perfection; the other
<PB N="4" REF="017681_0003_0FA21E2ECFFD5688">&s;even not perfect yet, but very far advanced. This peo|ple are Europeans, a part of which came from England to New-York in the year 1774, and lived at New-York and Albany, and places adjacent, two years&mdash;and in the year 1776, the re&s;t came to Philadelphia, and travelled through Penn&s;ylvania to New-York, where the whole twelve came together, and directly went and made a purcha&s;e of land, in a place called Ni&s;queunia, about nine or ten miles north|we&s;t from Albany, where they immediately &s;ettled, and went to clearing their land, and following their occupati|ons of black&s;mithing, weaving and &s;hoe-making and were unknown and unnoticed, unle&s;s by a few of their neigh|bours, until the 17th day of April 1780; at which time one Talmage Bi&s;hop brought tidings into New-Lebanon of a number of &s;trange and wonderful Chri&s;tians; the people, like the Athenians of old, were filled with define to &s;ee new things, and ran to &s;ee them. This brings me to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. Their manner of addre&s;s.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on goes to &s;ee them, they all meet him with many &s;miles, and &s;eeming great gladne&s;s; they bid him welcome, and directly tell him they knew of his com|ing ye&s;terday. This &s;ets the per&s;on to wondering at their knowledge, and pre&s;ently they get the per&s;on &s;ome victu|als; then they &s;it down and have a &s;pell of &s;inging; they &s;ing odd tunes, and Briti&s;h marches, &s;ometimes without words, and &s;ometimes with a minute of words known and unknown. After &s;inging they fall to &s;haking their hands in a very extraordinary manner, with their eyes &s;hut and face up; then a woman about forty years old &s;its and makes a &s;ort of a prayer, chiefly in an unknown tongue (if I may &s;o call it) then one of the men comes to the per|&s;on, and pretends to interpret the woman's prayer; after which they tell the per&s;on the has come to the right place to be in&s;tructed; they enquire the per&s;on's name, and ever after call him by his Chri&s;tian name: They u&s;e no com|pliments, but their language is, <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>nay.</HI> If the per|&s;on have long hair, or a club, they bring the bible, and read to him 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. chap. and 14th ver&s;e, then telling him if he intends to be in&s;tructed, he mu&s;t fir&s;t have his hair out &s;hort; telling of his that he wears the mark of the bea&s;t.
<PB N="5" REF="017681_0004_0FA21E2FD8AEA250">If he con&s;ents to have his hair cut, after it is done, they come round him, and touch him with their fingers here and there, and give him a fly cro&s;s, and in a very loving way, put their hands on his head, and then begin to preach their doctrine to him. But this leads me to enter on the third thing propo&s;ed, viz.</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evidence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P>They introduce their doctrine with a multitude of good words; &s;aying, we mu&s;t hate &s;in, love GOD, take up our cro&s;s, &amp;c. Then proceed to &s;ay, in the fir&s;t place, that there is a new di&s;pen&s;ation taking place, in which the &s;aints &s;hall reign a thou&s;and years with Chri&s;t, and that in that &s;tate the &s;aints &s;hall be perfect, and that they have enter|ed into it, and that they are the only church in the world; telling the per&s;on or hearer, that they have all the Apo|&s;tolic gifts that were ever given; they tell the per&s;on that he has come to the right place for in&s;truction, for they only are able to teach; then they pau&s;e a while to &s;ee how the per&s;on receives it, if they find he li&s;tens, and &s;eems to be coming, they proceed and &s;ay, all the churches now in the world are antichri&s;t, and fal&s;e churches, and that there is not one per&s;on born again among them all, and that there has not one gone to Heaven for the&s;e twelve hundred years, no, not &s;ince the Apo&s;tolick age. If the per&s;on makes any objections, they tell him he mu&s;t not di&s;pute, his bu&s;ine&s;s is to hear and receive in&s;truction, and all hands will fall to confirming the truth of what is declared: This puts the per&s;on to &s;ilence, and then they proceed, with a great laugh, and tell him they have many things to &s;ay to him, which he is not yet able to bear; this is to engage to per|&s;on to hear. Then, &s;econdly, they proceed to &s;ay, that all external ordinances, e&s;pecially bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, cea&s;ed in the Apo&s;tolick age; and that God had never &s;ent one man to preach, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles days, un|til they entered into the new di&s;pen&s;ation, and were &s;ent by God, from Great-Britain, to call in God's elect; and to confirm the truth of what the teacher has &s;aid, he (the teacher) falls a trembling, and will &s;ay he feels the blood of Chri&s;t now running down his thigh and leg. Then they
<PB N="6" REF="017681_0005_0FA21E307482CF60">tell the per&s;on the cannot bear any more now, but he mu&s;t come again very &s;oon and they will tell him more; and thus they with many fawning embraces, part with him for that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. When he comes again they meet him with great joy, cla&s;p him in their arms, and tell him they have the great love of God; and after things are a little &s;ettled, they be|gin with him again, telling him that he mu&s;t confe&s;s his &s;ins to them, from his childhood, that they may take his ca&s;e and travail for him, that he may be born again. If he be a profe&s;&s;or of godline&s;s, and pleads that he hopes his &s;ins are forgiven, and wa&s;hed away by the blood of Chri&s;t; they tell him nay, they are not forgiven. They tell him what&s;oever is done in &s;ecret mu&s;t be revealed on the hou&s;e-top; and that they being the church, are the hou&s;e-top. Then one takes him alone, and if he confe&s;&s;es his &s;ins to him, then he tells it to the re&s;t: But if it be &s;u&s;|pected he keeps back part of his &s;in, he mu&s;t confe&s;s the whole all being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. They tell him they &s;ee angels, and conver&s;e with them, and hear them &s;ing, and &s;ing with them; and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, they al&s;o freely conver&s;e with. They further tell him, the &s;ong that they &s;ing, is the &s;ong of the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which no man can learn, but only tho&s;e that are redeemed from the earth. Then tell him, they have got a mother point|ing to a woman, one of their company: And that &s;he &s;peaks &s;eventy-two tongues, and that when &s;he &s;peaks in unknown tongues, the living people cannot under&s;tand her; yet the dead under&s;tand her, for &s;he talks to them.</P>
<P N="5">5. They proceed and &s;ay, the judgment is &s;et, the books are opened, and the dead are now ri&s;ing, and coming to judgment, and they are &s;et to judge the world: Quoting 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. chap. 2 ver&s;e. They tell the per&s;on, that the great tribunal is that church, and that the dead are com|ing before them every day, to be judged. They go on to &s;ay, all that have died in an imperfect &s;tate, have gone to hell, or to a pri&s;on &s;tate; and there to pay the debt to divine ju&s;tice by &s;uffering; and that there are degrees of
<PB N="7" REF="017681_0006_0FA21E31358D9458">puni&s;hment, which they are to pa&s;s through; great &s;ins, a great degree of hell, &s;mall &s;ins, a &s;mall hell: And after pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;everal degrees of puni&s;hment, and paying the whole debt, out they come, and &s;tand before us (&s;ay they) and are acquitted, and go home to Heaven; they quote for proof, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xvi. 10. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxviii. 18. <HI>Eze|kiel</HI> xvi. 44&mdash;61. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iii. 18, 19, 20. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iv. 6.</P>
<P>They comment on tho&s;e texts thus: Did Chri&s;t go to hell? Yes. When? Why when he was crucified. What did he go there for? Why to preach to the &s;pirits in pri|&s;on. What did he preach to them? Why the go&s;pel. Why did he preach the go&s;pel to the old world, or to the dead? Why that they might be judged, as unconverted &s;inners, but finally live, according to God, in the &s;pirit, af|ter they have paid the debt in &s;uffering.</P>
<P N="6">6. They &s;ay, that the forecited woman, about forty years of age, is the woman &s;poken of in the xiith chapter of the Revelations of John, who was cloathed with the &s;un, having the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve &s;tars; and that &s;he has travailed and brought forth the man child. Further, that &s;he is the mother of all the elect; and that &s;he travail, for the whole world; and that no ble&s;&s;ing can come to any per&s;on, but only by and through her; and that in the way of her be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;ins, by their confe&s;&s;ing of them, and repenting of the &s;ame, one by one, according to her di|rection.</P>
<P N="7">7. They hold them&s;elves &s;o far immortal, that they &s;hall never die, but &s;hall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and go from this to the upper regions; and that now they are above all temptations and &s;ufferings, and can nei|ther be lifted up or ca&s;t down; only as they &s;uffer in tra|vail for the elect. I might &s;till proceed much further on this head; but as it will nece&s;&s;arily fall into their in&s;tructi|ons to their adherents, I pa&s;s by it for the pre&s;ent, and &s;hall proceed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. To &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip (if it may be &s;o called.)</P>
<P>The manner and form of their wor&s;hip is entirely new
<PB N="8" REF="017681_0007_0FA21E3206B719D8">and different from all others: It differs but little on the Sa|bath, from any other day: They begin by &s;itting down and &s;haking their heads in a violent manner, turning their heads half round, &s;o that their face looks over each &s;houl|der, their eyes being &s;hut; while they are thus &s;haking, one will begin to &s;ing &s;ome odd tune, without words or rule; after a while another will &s;trike in; and then ano|ther; and after a while they all fail in, and make a &s;trange charm:&mdash;Some &s;inging without words, and &s;ome with an unknown tongue, or mutter, and &s;ome with a mixture of Engli&s;h: The mother, &s;o called minds to &s;trike &s;uch notes as makes a concord, and &s;o form the charm. When they leave off &s;inging, they drop off, one by one, as oddly as they come on; in the be&s;t part of their wor&s;hip, every one acts for him&s;elf, and almo&s;t every one different from the other; one will &s;tand with his arms extended, acting over odd po&s;tures, which they call &s;igns; another will be danc|ing, and &s;ometimes hopping on one leg about the floor; another will fall to turning round, &s;o &s;wift, that if it be a woman, her cloaths will be &s;o filled with the wind as though they were kept out by a hoop; another will be pro&s;|trate on the floor; another will be talking with &s;omebody; and &s;ome &s;itting by &s;moaking their pipes; &s;ome groaning mo&s;t di&s;mally; &s;ome trembling extremely; others acting as though all their nerves were convul&s;ed; others &s;winging their arms, with all vigour, as though they were turning a wheel, &amp;c. Then all break off and have a &s;pell of &s;moak|ing, and &s;ometimes great fits of laughter.&mdash;They have &s;e|veral &s;uch exerci&s;es in a day, e&s;pecially on the Sabbath. When they go to eat, they &s;it down, and have a &s;pell of &s;inging and &s;haking the head at the table, before they eat, &s;ome times they kneel down, &s;hake their heads and groan, &s;ay nothing, and then fall to eating, and will be very mer|ry and airy. If one has done eating before the re&s;t, he kneels down, &s;hakes his head a &s;pell, and off he goes and leaves the re&s;t eating; &s;o each one di&s;mi&s;&s;es the table for him&s;elf: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to point out any exact form; for they vary and differ, and &s;eldom act the &s;ame form exactly over again. They chu&s;e &s;o to do, to be &s;ingular,
<PB N="9" REF="017681_0008_0FA21E32C4175D00">left, as they &s;ay, they &s;hould be connected with Babylon Every day their wor&s;hip is &s;imilar to what has been ob&s;erv|ed. They have no publick prayer, no preaching, and but little reading. Their actions in wor&s;hip is according to the dictates of the &s;pirit that governs them; then they profe&s;s &s;aying, they are in a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn as far as may be, their manner of wor&s;hip, I proceed fifthly, to &s;hew the directions which they give to tho&s;e that come to them to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P N="5">V. When any per&s;on goes to them to be in&s;tructed, they enquire of him, whether he has given his vote and money for the defence of the country, and pre&s;ently tell him, it is contrary to the Go&s;pel to bear arms, &s;aying Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world; they labour to convince him that it is a great error to have any thing to do with war and fighting: They directly tell him, he is not born again, and that he mu&s;t ob&s;erve their in&s;tructions, in order that he may attain to the new birth.&mdash;Then they tell him, he mu&s;t confe&s;s his &s;in to them; for if he hides his &s;in they can do nothing for him: They further tell him, if he refu&s;es, they can tell him all his &s;in that he ever committed; and pretend that he can keep nothing hid from them; and when they have frightened him to a confe&s;&s;ion, then they further tell him, he mu&s;t renounce and ab&s;tain from all the works of the fle&s;h; telling him, that the fir&s;t fall of our fir&s;t parents, was carnal copulation, and that this ruined the world; and that every one that has any thing to do with man or woman, in the work of generation, is acting <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI>'s &s;in over again: They tell the man to ob&s;tain from his wife, the woman from her hu&s;|band, and that if the wife doth not agree to it, the hu&s;band mu&s;t put her away; and if the hu&s;band will not agree to it, the wife mu&s;t leave her hu&s;band; and for an example, the mother, &s;o called, will tell how &s;he left her hu&s;band, in New-York, and one of the men, how he left his wife in England. They tell young men and young women, if they marry, and have any thing to do with the works of lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, they can never be born again: They
<PB N="10" REF="017681_0009_0FA21E338A80B0B0">&s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving this in&s;truction by quot|ing <HI>Rev.</HI> iii 3, 4, 5. They dwell more on this part of their in&s;tructions than all the re&s;t. They tell their adherents, if they conform to their in&s;tructions in this point, there is no fear of their being born again; but if they di&s;obey, they certainly will be damned. While they are thus in&s;truct|ing their adherents, they &s;ometimes u&s;e great &s;everity, and &s;ometimes great flattery, to frighten on the one hand and allure on the other; and while they are thus at work with a per&s;on, they come round him, touch him with their fin|gers in different places, cro&s;s him here and there, get their hands on his head, and prophecy, that great ble&s;&s;ings are laid up for him: They pre&s;ently make him believe them, and as &s;oon as they &s;ee the &s;pirit begin to operate on him, then they tell him, that now he has received the Holy Gho&s;t, and now if he di&s;obeys, it is a gone ca&s;e with him: They tell him, if he had never come to &s;ee them, and had died in his ignorance without receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, he would have gone to hell or a pri&s;on &s;tate, and &s;uffered a while, and then come out and gone to Heaven; but now, if he turns back, there is no forgivene&s;s, neither in this world, nor that which is to come: They quote for proof, <HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 32. This is to terrify the per&s;on, and bring him into an ab&s;olute dependence on them: Then they tell him, he mu&s;t come often to them to be in&s;tructed, or he will be in danger of being taken by evil &s;pirits and led wrong; and that he mu&s;t not think he can under&s;tand the Bible, or know in any re&s;pect how to act, but only as he receives in&s;truction from them: They tell him they have many things for him, which he is not yet able to bear; but as fa&s;t as he is able to receive it, they will in&s;truct him: Thus the per&s;on is kept in con&s;tant expectation of &s;ome|thing new. If the per&s;on &s;eems to be &s;ober, then one takes him by the hand, and round the floor with him, and make him run and &s;kip about, and laugh heartily at him, and will tell him he mu&s;t not be melancholy; and when they get him merry with them then let him go: Then they tell the per&s;on for his admiration, that &s;ince he has been
<PB N="11" REF="017681_0010_0FA21E34478AA230">pre&s;ent, they have had many of the dead come before them to be judged; and make him believe they know his thoughts, and know future events, and nothing can be hid from them; telling how people are together, and talking about them, and what they &s;ay, &amp;c. Then they tell the per&s;on that they &s;hall never die, and al&s;o all tho&s;e that o|bey them, and get to be perfect, &s;hall never die, but be chang|ed in a moment, and go home body and &s;oul: But all the bodies of tho&s;e that die in their &s;in, &s;hall never ri&s;e.&mdash;They further tell him, that the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which were &s;ealed; twelve thou&s;and out of each tribe, is a work yet to be done; and that they are of the tribe of Benjamin, though the younge&s;t tribe, and la&s;t in the account, yet fir&s;t in the order, of being &s;ealed; and that they are the fir&s;t fruits of that tribe; and that all that are to be brought in, in America, will belong to that tribe: And thus, the la&s;t is to be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t la&s;t.</P>
<P>I might &s;till proceed, on this head; but it would be end|le&s;s to repeat all their in&s;tructions to their adherents, as they are ever &s;tudying new things to keep up the dependence and admiration of their di&s;ciples. I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s on.</P>
<P N="6">VI. To &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructions, on their adherents.</P>
<P>There is a very extraordinary and uncommon power attends their in&s;tructions; in the fir&s;t place, a total blind|ne&s;s, as to all their former views of religion and the Bi|ble, on the in&s;tructed, takes place; and then a &s;trange infatuation of the mind, to believe all their teachers &s;ay. Pre&s;ently a &s;trange power begins to come on, and takes place in the body, or human frame; which &s;ets the per&s;on to gaping and &s;tretching; and &s;oon &s;ets him to twitching, as though his nerves were all in a convul&s;ion. I can com|pare it to nothing nearer in its feelings, than the operati|ons of an electeri&s;ing machine; the per&s;on believes it is the power of God, and therefore dare not re&s;i&s;t, but wholly gives way to it.&mdash;Thus the power comes on, more and more; and as the power increa&s;es, &s;o their faith in|crea&s;es,
<PB N="12" REF="017681_0011_0FA21E34F4B63F58">in their teachers. If any body oppo&s;es them, it brings on the power, quick, &s;trong and violent; and they cry out, on the oppo&s;er, that he will be damn'd, for op|po&s;ing the power of God; and fall to twitching and trembling, as though they had an extreme fit of the ague. This power as it increa&s;es, it brings on, many times, ex|treme weakne&s;s of body, &s;o that their limbs fail them, and they fall to the floor, or on the ground, and lie helple&s;s: At other times, it brings on great &s;hakings&mdash;and &s;hrugging of the &s;houlders&mdash;and tramping about with the feet&mdash;di&s;mal groans and out-cries&mdash;and perhaps, may i&s;&s;ue, for that time, in great laughter and lightne&s;s. And at the time of intervals, they grow very dumb, and &s;ay but little; and as the power has its fits on them, &s;o it grows more power|ful, until it leads on to what they call &s;igns. The power will take their hand, &s;tretch it up, pull the other down, they interpret it&mdash;the hand up, is a &s;ign of mercy, the hand down, of judgment: Sometimes their hand is &s;tretched out forward, then away they run after it; if it leads to &s;ome per&s;on, they lay their hand on his head&mdash;then cro&s;s their arms, one acro&s;s the other&mdash;then &s;ay he mu&s;t take up his cro&s;s, and renounce the works of the fle&s;h&mdash;then they &s;tretch both hands behind them, and &s;ay he mu&s;t leave the world behind him: Sometimes their hands will be cramped up, one finger &s;tretched out &s;trait, another down into their hand, and their hand all out of common &s;hape: Sometimes their hand will &s;tretch out, and after it they run,&mdash;through woods&mdash;cro&s;s lots&mdash;over fences, &s;wamps, or whatever, until they come to a hou&s;e; perhaps they will be &s;topt &s;e|veral times in their cour&s;e, and their head turn them round, as though they had lo&s;t their way; then take a new &s;et off, and run again; perhaps, when they get to the hou&s;e, they will lie down on the ground&mdash;make a round ring with their finger among the dirt&mdash;puther about in it&mdash;then &s;tart up&mdash;double their fi&s;t at it&mdash;run away from it&mdash;come at it again&mdash;&s;how the looks of vengeance at it&mdash;threaten it with po&s;tures&mdash;then run and jump into it, and &s;tamp it all to pieces&mdash;This &s;ign they interpret to be the old Heavens,
<PB N="13" REF="017681_0012_0FA21E3643BC5450">which are to pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e.&mdash;When he goes into the hou&s;e, he flutters round with his hands flying, and hi&s;&s;ing as if he intended to drive all the flies out of the room&mdash;But this, he &s;ays, is to haunt the evil &s;pirits out, which the hou&s;e is full of.</P>
<P>After he has done his errand, he follows his hand off, without a&s;king how they do, or bidding them farewell.&mdash;When they meet together for their wor&s;hip, they fall to groaning and trembling, and every one acts alone for him|&s;elf; one will fall pro&s;trate on the floor, another on his knees, and his head in his hands, on the floor; another will be muttering over articulate &s;ounds, which neither they or any body el&s;e under&s;tand. Some will be &s;inging, each one his own tune; &s;ome without words, in an Indian tone, &s;ome &s;ing jig tunes, &s;ome tunes of their own making in an un|known mutter, which they call new tongues; &s;ome will be dancing, and others &s;tand laughing heartily and loudly; others will be drumming on the floor with their feet, as though a pair of drum-&s;ticks were beating a ruff on a drum|head; others will be agonizing, as though they were in great pain; others jumping up and down; others fluttering over &s;ome body, and talking to them; others will be &s;hoo|ing and hi&s;&s;ing evil &s;pirits out of the hou&s;e, until the diffe|rent tunes, groaning, jumping, dancing, drumming, laugh|ing, talking and fluttering, &s;hooing and hi&s;&s;ing, makes a perfect Bedlam; this they call the wor&s;hip of God. They &s;peak highly of their teachers, and &s;ay tho&s;e men at Ni&s;|queunia are the angels of God, &s;ent forth to gather in God's elect. Some of them &s;ay, that the woman called the mo|ther, has the fullne&s;s of the God-Head, bodily dwelling in her, and that &s;he is the queen of Heaven, Chri&s;t's wife; and that all God's elect mu&s;t be born through her; yea, that Chri&s;t through her is born the &s;econd time. They &s;ay, that that church (as they call it) has power to &s;hut Heaven, that it rain not, and to bring on all manner of plagues, as often as they will. They prophecy that this go&s;pel (as they call it) mu&s;t be preached to all the world, and all tho&s;e that do not fall in with it will be damned. If
<PB N="14" REF="017681_0013_0FA21E369F91F090">any body oppo&s;es them, they get round him, threaten him with damnation, &s;torm and &s;tamp at him, &s;tare open their eyes, pucker up their mouths, and cry oh! oh! oh! at him, and act all the po&s;tures of vengeance, which is enough to frighten a Hercules out of his wits.</P>
<P>Every one, as &s;oon as they fall in with this new religion, immediately throw down their arms, and cry out again&s;t the means of defence made u&s;e of again&s;t the common e|nemy, and appear the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate again&s;t all the pro|ceedings of the country. I have heard &s;ome of them &s;ay, that all our authority, civil and military, is from hell, and would go there again. The effect of this &s;cheme is &s;uch, that men and their wives have parted, children run away from their parents, and &s;ociety entirely broke up in neigh|bourhoods; it makes children deny and di&s;own their pa|rents, and &s;ay they are full of devils. They are conti|nually throwing out their cur&s;es on all that do not fall in with them; prophe&s;ying the de&s;truction of the country; declaring they belong to the kingdom of God, and at the &s;ame time, if they are a&s;ked whether they are born again they will &s;ay nay. If any per&s;on goes to rea&s;on with them, they immediately put their &s;ingers in their ears, or run off out of hearing, or el&s;e drown him with clamour, noi&s;e and cur&s;es: And as their teachers advi&s;e and order children to run away from parents, and men to &s;hut their doors again&s;t their own brethren, by blood, and refu&s;e them any admi&s;&s;ion into their hou&s;es; all their orders are punctually obeyed.</P>
<P>They make great dependence on their &s;igns, and &s;ay it is the power of God, and God has taken that way to preach by them: One of them had a &s;ign, that a certain man had committed murder, and charged him with it, which the man denied; he again had a &s;ign, that a certain man in|tended to kill two children and their mother, on a certain night; then he had a &s;ign for two of his a&s;&s;ociates to go and lie all night behind the hou&s;e, and watch for him, and when they heard the children cry, to ru&s;h in, take the man and bind him, and bring the man to him; the two men o|beyed
<PB N="15" REF="017681_0014_0FA21E3927A55290">his orders, believing in his &s;ign: About break of day he had a &s;ign, that they catched the man and bound him; however, in the morning, the two men returned having not &s;een the man. Thus their &s;igns in general prove fal&s;e; however they get out this way, that the &s;ign is true, but that they made a fal&s;e interpretation. I knew another, who under the operation of the &s;pirit prophe&s;ied, that at the end of two weeks, New-London would be de|&s;troyed, and at the end of four weeks, Albany would be burnt, and the next day the world would be at an end; all which proved fal&s;e. Another had a &s;ign, that a certain man, on &s;uch a day, would kill him, and on the third day he &s;hould ri&s;e again into life and action; which likewi&s;e proved fal&s;e. One of their po&s;tures which increa&s;e a|mong them, is turning round very &s;wift for an hour, and &s;ometimes for two hours at a time, until then are all wet with &s;weat; this they &s;ay is to &s;hew the great power of God.</P>
<P>They meet together in the night, and have been heard two miles by the people, in the dead of the night; &s;ome|times a company of them will run away to &s;ome hou&s;e, get into it, rai&s;e a bedlam, wake up all in the hou&s;e, and the neighbours round about for a mile: They run about in the woods and el&s;ewhere, hooting and tooting like owls; &s;ome of them have &s;tripped naked in the woods, and thought they were angels, and invi&s;ible, and could go about among men and not be &s;een, and have lo&s;t their clothes, and ne|ver found them again. Sometimes while eating at the ta|ble, they &s;ay their dead parents and brethren come on the table and &s;et on a pye, and they &s;ee them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At one of their meetings they hung a woman by the neck, but took her down before &s;he was dead, to &s;hew as a &s;ign, how they were to be per&s;ecuted; and now while I am writing, I am informed by good authority, that two men in the &s;cheme have murdered them&s;elves, one cut his throat, the other &s;tabbed him&s;elf, after he had tried twice to kill his wife, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might proceed much further, but it is as impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="16" REF="017681_0015_0FA21E3974F02F60">fully &s;et forth the power and effect of this new religion, as to trace the airy road of the meteor; I therefore proceed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To &s;hew what this new religion is, as pointed out by &s;cripture te&s;timony.</P>
<P>In opening this propo&s;ition it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, on the great purpo&s;es of God, which will terminate in two grand events; fir&s;t, the deliverance of his people, and fulfilling his promi&s;es to them: Secondly, the de&s;truc|tion of the man of &s;in. The&s;e events will conclude and fini&s;h the reign of Antichri&s;t: And the work of God in ge|neral, has a &s;pecial re&s;pect, both in his providence and grace, to the grand conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every age of the church have had their trials and com|bats, with the great enemy of God and his people; and as God's work and de&s;igns have advanced forward, &s;o the power of the enemy has increa&s;ed; and it is very evident, that the la&s;t &s;truggles of the enemy will be the mo&s;t pow|erful and dangerous; this God &s;aw, and in his great good|ne&s;s has adverti&s;ed his people of the delu&s;ions and errors that would take place in the la&s;t days; knowing that the crafty &s;erpent would act over again, his &s;ubtil wiles, in the highe&s;t preten&s;ions of the greate&s;t good. We are inform|ed by our Lord, in Matt. xxiv. 24. that fal&s;e Chri&s;ts and fal&s;e prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders in &s;o much that if it were po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould deceive the very elect.</P>
<P>This matter is more fully opened and illu&s;trated by the great apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, ii. 3&mdash;12. he gives advice, not to be deceived; for the day of Chri&s;t &s;hall not come, before there come fir&s;t a falling away; and that the man of &s;in be revealed, whom he calls the &s;on of perdition, who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped: So that he as God &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing that he is God;&mdash;he &s;hews in the 7th ver&s;e, that it is the great my&s;tery of iniquity, who&s;e coming &s;hall be after the working of &s;atan, with all power, and &s;igns and lying wonders, with all de|ceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. As this great delu&s;ion
<PB N="17" REF="017681_0016_0FA21E3B50DA8788">is to take place in the la&s;t days, before the coming of Chri&s;t, we are charged by our Lord to watch, we are therefore to watch the &s;igns of his coming, and to watch the motions of the my&s;tery of iniquity, which if well attended to, it will appear mo&s;t evident, that this is the day in which we may expect to &s;ee &s;atan, in the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t delu&s;ive ma|chinations, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a &s;hort time. Rev. xii. 12. And while men are looking for the great revolution, or change of times to take place, when Chri&s;t &s;hall reign in and with his church a thou&s;and years;&mdash;&s;atan finds it the mo&s;t fit &s;ea&s;on to pre&s;ent a coun|terfeit, dre&s;t in the highe&s;t colours of &s;anctity and holi|ne&s;s; and as many expect to &s;ee new things take place in the Millenium &s;tate; &s;o &s;atan improves his advantage on &s;uch, by pre&s;enting new religion, new laws, new modes and forms, new churches, new preaching, new doctrine, new views, new di&s;coveries, new &s;pirit, new bibles, or &s;een in a new light, new Heaven and new glory.&mdash;And that all old things are to pa&s;s away, no more old religion, no more old modes and forms, old churches, old preach|ing and doctrine are to cea&s;e; old views, old experiences, and old conver&s;ion to be rejected; old friend&s;hip, old re|lations, and old love to be known no more. And while the plea&s;ing picture by the arch enemy is pre&s;ented to view, it finds many admirers.</P>
<P>It is very evident, that this is the very day in which this work of Satan is on the wheel: And notwith&s;tanding, it may appear unaccountable to every rational mind, that any of the human &s;pecie &s;hould fall in with &s;o diabolical a &s;cheme; yet when we con&s;ider its fine dre&s;s of perfecti|on, and the &s;pirit of infatuation and witchcraft, that at|tends it, it may form our minds into a belief, that it can be and really is &s;o.</P>
<P>It is further evident that Antichri&s;t cannot appear in any other light or path, but only that which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles has marked out for it.&mdash;I will therefore com|pare the works and character of Antichri&s;t with this new and &s;trange religion, as it is delineated and &s;et forth.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="017681_0017_0FA21E3C63A16DF0">
The Apo&s;tle Paul, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, iii. 1&mdash;9, points out this very people, in this new religion, and &s;hews they were to appear in the la&s;t day, bearing the character of God's enemies. Again, in 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. The Holy Gho&s;t points out the doctrines of this new religion, and calls them the doctrines of devils, which are taught them by &s;educing &s;pirits. Again, 2 Peter, ii. 1, 2, 3. Their here&s;ies are &s;poken of, and of their denying the Lord that bought them. Nothing is more evident than that the Apo&s;tle points out this very people, for they throw away their conver&s;ion and begin to repent of their &s;in which they committed in their childhood; and thus to attone and make &s;atisfaction, and &s;tep up the ladder of their own works, into a &s;tate of perfection; but if death &s;hould overtake them before they get to be perfect, then down to hell they mu&s;t go, to pay the remainder in &s;uffer|ing, and when they have paid the debt and are born again in hell, then to come out and go to Heaven; will they thank Chri&s;t, as the great mediator, and adore him, for his attoning blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s? No, not at all; Oh, dreadful &s;cheme, that &s;tands oppo&s;ed to the glorious plan of redemption by Chri&s;t! Well might Peter and Jude &s;ay of them, wells without water, clouds without rain, twice dead, pluckt up by the roots, wandering &s;tars; for whom is re&s;erved the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever. Again,</P>
<P>I find this new religion differs from the true religion of the go&s;pel, re&s;pecting &s;aith.</P>
<P>I find go&s;pel religion &s;ays, being ju&s;tified by faith, Rom. v. 1. but this new religion &s;ays by works.&mdash;To decide this matter, I &s;hall attend to the Apo&s;tle, in Rom. iv. 4, 5. where he &s;ays, <HI>To him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;&mdash;but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The true Chri&s;tian &s;ees by saith, lives by faith, walks by faith, fights the good fight of faith, and gets the victory by faith: But the people in this new religion, do not &s;o much as talk about faith in Chri&s;t, but they place their whole knowledge in their religion, on their pretended vi&s;ions, prophe&s;ies and
<PB N="19" REF="017681_0018_0FA21E3EEC90F750">&s;igns.&mdash;Another thing which proves this new religion to be fal&s;e, is what follows.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle James, in his epi&s;|tle i. 5, &s;ays, <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God who giveth liberally.</HI> But this people go to Ni&s;queunia, to a&s;k of a number of Europeans, what they &s;hall do &mdash; who tell them, agreeable to what I find 2 Peter, ii. 18, 19. They &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity, and allure through their much wantonne&s;s, tho&s;e that were clean e&s;caped, from them who live in error; and while they promi&s;ed them liberty, they them&s;elves are the &s;ervants of corrup|tion.&mdash;And further, in&s;tead of attending to the worthy in|&s;tructions of our Godly teachers, they are burning all the books of divinity, and learning, they come at.&mdash;In this new religion is the whole magazine of error, trea&s;ured up in the great my&s;tery of iniquity, in which is found all the power of delu&s;ive witchcraft, to blindfold &s;ouls, and lead them to hell. I might cite a multitude of &s;cripture in proof of this point, but &s;hall only &s;ay, the whole canon of God's word is levelled again&s;t this new religion, and doth and will eternally conderin it, and all its propaga|tors &s;hall not be able to &s;tand the trial; with which I clo&s;e this head and proceed,</P>
<P N="8">VIII. To give &s;ome rea&s;ons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere &s;peculation, but &s;orrowful ex|perience.</P>
<P>On the 13th day of May la&s;t, I received a reque&s;t from a church at Stillwater, above Albany, to attend on a con|ference, the 25th day of the &s;ame month; and being di&s;|po&s;ed to go, two of my brethren offered to bear me com|pany, provided I would return back by the way of Ni&s;|queunia with them, to &s;ee a new and &s;trange people living there. I con&s;ented to their propo&s;ition, in con&s;equence of their company in my journey, and on the 26th day of May la&s;t we arrived at Ni&s;queunia: The Europeans, though &s;trangers, received us very kindly, and pre&s;ently told us they knew of our coming the day before; this &s;et me to wondering at their knowledge. After they had got us &s;ome victuals, one of them came and &s;at down by me,
<PB N="20" REF="017681_0019_0FA21E3FA3A0BE28">and began to &s;peak many good words, &s;aying, I mu&s;t hate &s;in, love God, and take up my cro&s;s, &amp;c. then went on to tell about a new di&s;pen&s;ation, and that they had got into it; his words &s;eemed &s;o well placed, that I heard them with attention: Mean while a man, one of their com|pany, &s;tands up before me, and began to &s;tretch and bend, and extend his arms up and down, and to act all manner of po&s;tures, and turn his eyes almo&s;t in&s;ide out; I had ne|ver &s;een or heard of &s;uch actions before, and it &s;et me a wondering what he meant. By this time my mind was much engaged, attending to one that &s;poke good words, and to the other that acted &s;o oddly. Mean while he that &s;poke drew near to me, and every little while would touch me with his finger; but I thought it was that I might mind well what he &s;aid; he likewi&s;e would give me a &s;ly cro&s;s, and put his hand on my head or about me, which I took not much notice of. The mother, &s;o called, looked very &s;miling, came and &s;at down, and began to &s;ing a &s;trange tune, with a my&s;tical voice, in a mixture of words, known and unknown, which &s;eemed to be a perfect charm.</P>
<P>After they had been the object of attention for &s;ome time, I turned my thoughts on my former views of religi|on, and found, to my admiration, my mind was turned wholly up-&s;ide down; and began to think I had been all my life in a dream about religion.&mdash;After a further di&s;co|very of their wor&s;hip, I felt greatly &s;hocked and confound|ed; yet a &s;ecret belief kept prevailing, that they were the people of God. I tarried all night, but &s;at up, hearing and &s;eeing tho&s;e &s;trange things until the break of day, in which time they gave me a hint of their purgatory &s;cheme, which greatly &s;hocked my mind: In this tumult of thought I left them in the morning, about eight o'clock, and re|turned home.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time I found a power come on me, dif|ferent from what I had ever felt before, and made me feel very weak and maugre, and in a little time it &s;o affected my nerves that they gave a twich, as &s;udden as a fla&s;h of lightning; at fir&s;t I thought what can that be? But imme|diately
<PB N="21" REF="017681_0020_0FA21E408E4B4D40">the an&s;wer was ready, It is the power of God: This made me give way to it, daring not to re&s;i&s;t it, and immediately it gave me another twitch; it had this effect on me, to make me attend to the power, and in &s;o doing I thought I attended on God: It never brought me to what they call &s;igns, and to &s;o great &s;haking as &s;ome have; however, I fully believed it was the work of God, and yet I found great difficulties to get along; to give up my old experience, appeared a great thing, and to hold them was contrary to the &s;cheme. However, I reconciled my difficulties as well as I could, by concluding, that in the new di&s;pen&s;ation, new things would appear, and greater light would &s;hine, and whatever was wanting in my old experience would now appear; yet &s;o far as they went they might be good; yet many told me, I would ever be weak in the new, until I threw away all the old.</P>
<P>I went again to Nu&s;queunia and received further in&s;truc|tions from the Europeans, and &s;eemed to be more confirm|ed. Having given them a relation of my life, they made me many large promi&s;es of very great ble&s;&s;ings and &s;till I remained under the operation of the &s;pirit.&mdash;But in a little time the effect of this new work in many, appeared &s;o wild that it troubled me much, and I thought it my duty to &s;ever between the precious and the vile; which when I began to do, they ro&s;e upon me with a di&s;mal hi&s;s, and had a &s;ign to &s;top me; however, I went through again&s;t their &s;igns; and as the work went on, more incon&s;i&s;ten|cies and fal&s;hoods appeared, which made me repeat a re|jection of &s;uch things, and made mention of &s;ome imper|fections I have &s;een in their teachers; this made them ri&s;e in &s;uch a clamour, hi&s;s and uproar, as though the infernal den had broke loo&s;e: This gave me &s;uch a &s;hock, that I could go no further until I had examined the &s;cheme over again. For this purpo&s;e I attended to my Bible more carefully, and my eyes began to be opened, and the power on me began to decrea&s;e; but had great threatnings &s;ent to me from the teachers and others; telling me if I turn|ed back, damnation was my portion.&mdash;Their prophe&s;ies
<PB N="22" REF="017681_0021_0FA21E40F80A38D0">and their &s;igns appeared more and fal&s;e fal&s;e, which &s;till opened my eyes, and gave me great jealou&s;y, that this new religion was led by a fal&s;e &s;pirit, and in a little time the operation wholly left me; my eyes were wide open, and I was as though I had come out of a dark cellar, into the brighte&s;t beams of the noon day &s;un.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;pirit which leads on this new &s;cheme, is the &s;pirit of witchcraft, and is the mo&s;t powerful of any delu&s;ion I ever heard or read of except what I find in Acts viii. 9, 10, 11. It I have been in any mea&s;ure a means of leading any per&s;on into this wicked and dreadful delu&s;ion, I am very &s;orry, and as I heartily repent of my folly, I a&s;k the forgivene&s;s of all, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, that like my&s;elf, have been attending to creatures in&s;tead of lookin to God.</P>
<P>Having thus given a &s;hort, but true relation, of this new religion, in its &s;everal parts, together with my real and ab&s;olute knowledge of the &s;ame, by &s;orrowful experience, I pa&s;s on to the 9th, and la&s;t propo&s;ition, viz. To clo&s;e the whole by a word of advice to mini&s;ters and people.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="017681_0022_0FA21E41ED2C21F8">your duty to u&s;e your utmo&s;t exertions to prevent their calamitous &s;hipwreck, by the overflowing deluge of an infinite brood of evils.</P>
<P>The great and glorious doctrines of the go&s;pel are in|tended as a &s;acred barrier again&s;t bewitching error: O then endeavour to inculcate in the minds of your hearers, the great mediator&s;hip of Chri&s;t&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of rege|nerating grace, and a divine faith in God through the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and to maintain practical Godline&s;s, by carefully and clo&s;ely at|tending and adhering to every divine requirement.</P>
<P>DEAR SIRS,</P>
<P>THERE never was a day that more loudly called for faithful watchmen, than the pre&s;ent time; while we &s;ee Satan transforming him&s;elf into an angel of light, and bringing forward his deep laid &s;cheme, to undermine the glorious plan of Redemption by Chri&s;t: And as he at fir&s;t deceived the woman, and made u&s;e of her to delude the man; &s;o he is playing his old prank over again, &s;ending one woman from the State of New-York, and ano|ther from the State of Rhode-I&s;land, who vie with each other, and are as dangerous to the heedle&s;s pa&s;&s;enger as Scilla and Charibdes are to the un&s;kilful mariner. O then! what need is there of &s;kilful pilots and experienced helm&s;men, to &s;teer the &s;hip of Zion, and keep her in the true channel of faith and love to God.</P>
<P>The battle is now begun, Michael and his angels, and the dragon and his angels are now formed one again&s;t the other, for the grand deci&s;ion. Now, we may expect the whole artillery of the infernal den, charged with error, delu&s;ion and bla&s;phemy, attending with all the power of helli&s;h fury, in the la&s;t &s;truggle of the enemy.</P>
<P>Now therefore, you are to fight again&s;t all the powers of darkne&s;s, and with&s;tand Satan not only in his malig|nant rage and envy, but al&s;o in his deceitful flatteries and counterfeit friend&s;hip. For the old enemy of God and his people, like a grand politician, will try every method, by power, fraud and lies, to carry his diabolical de&s;igns
<PB N="24" REF="017681_0023_0FA21E4286C110A0">into execution.&mdash;You need therefore the whole armour of God, that you may be able to with&s;tand, and having done all to &s;tand; but there is no fear to them that put their tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, who will again come up from the fields of Edom, glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength, and will trample his enemies in his fury, and &s;prinkle his garments with the blood of his enemies. You know your leader and where your &s;trength lies; it is your duty to attend clo&s;ely to his directions, that you may be powerful in your warfare, to pull down the &s;trong holds of &s;in and Satan, and in &s;o doing &s;ave your&s;elves and them who hear you, and at la&s;t receive a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give at that day.</P>
<P>Dear Fathers in Chri&s;t, I clo&s;e my addre&s;s to you, by wi&s;hing you the ble&s;&s;ings of God in your pious labours to promote religion and virtue, and the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom. I commend you to God, and the power of his grace, who is able to make you &s;ucce&s;sful in building up your churches in the mo&s;t holy faith, and at la&s;t to give you all an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>I now turn my&s;elf to the people in general. My dear countrymen, I am deeply affected at the fearful omens of impending de&s;truction that &s;o loudly threaten our bleeding land. Surely God is angry, and the tokens of his di&s;|plea&s;ure are plainly di&s;covered. It is a day that calls for lamentation and mourning, repentence and reformation; it is for our &s;in that God has permitted the &s;word to be un&s;heathed upon us; and tyranny to clank its chains and threaten us with &s;lavery. Notwith&s;tanding it was our duty to look to God for help, and in an humble depen|dence on him to &s;tand forth in our defence, again&s;t a cru|el enemy; yet how has our armies degenerated into nur|&s;eries of impiety, and the contagious di&s;temper that we have been oppo&s;ing, &s;pread it&s;elf in our land? Vice and immorality abounds; &s;tupidity and profanne&s;s prevails; ambition and di&s;cord has been a growing evil; and how
<PB N="25" REF="017681_0024_0FA21E43666A0BA0">many of our countrymen, lo&s;t to the tender feelings of the human heart, been found more cruel than the O&s;trich. How many traiterous plans have been formed for our blood and trea&s;ure, by a banditti of infernal mi&s;creants? And notwith&s;tanding God has prevented, and his good providence bla&s;ted the de&s;igns of tho&s;e Cains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, that have combined again&s;t us, yet how have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> forgot the danger, without being found in &s;uitable returns to God.</P>
<P>The great enemy of God that has filled the world with uproar, war and death, has ever envied the recovery of man, by a glorious mediator; and has ever been trying to circumvent the merciful de&s;igns of God, through Chri&s;t, for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. And in addition to all his &s;ub|tile wiles, he takes the advantage of the great decay of religion and virtue, and makes it his opportunity to play his magic games, attended with the doctrine of purgato|ry, the wor&s;hip of the creature in&s;tead of the creator, and an earthly and creature tribunal, to bring the whole creation of men to trial. The &s;cheme is &s;o naked and balled, with all its &s;plendid &s;hew of perfection, that every rational mind would recoil at the thought of falling in with &s;uch a diabolical plan, was it not for a bewitching power that attends it, which turns every thing up&s;ide down, and puts darkne&s;s for light, error for truth, bitter for &s;weet, and hell for Heaven.</P>
<P>Multitudes have fallen in with this dreadful &s;cheme, and are &s;o infatuated in their &s;en&s;es, that they are depriv|ed of their rea&s;on, and pa&s;t recovery, unle&s;s God interpo&s;e for them. While the leaders of this dreadful cata&s;trophe, like the bowels of Aetna, are ever vomiting up their &s;ul|phur; like wild-fire it flies, and catches at a di&s;tance, and &s;preads like a plague. For &s;uch a delu&s;ion to take place in the land, loudly proclaims the judgment of God. For a people to be carried away with the power of error, be|&s;peaks their great darkne&s;s and ignorance of the truth.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, &s;uffer me to addre&s;s you with a word of advice. One great end and de&s;ign of this piece is to timely adverti&s;e you of the growing evils that
<PB N="26" REF="017681_0025_0FA21E43F47C2458">are prevailing in our land, e&s;pecially the fatal delu&s;ion &s;et forth in this narrative. Con&s;ider the great and noble end of your creation. You were not made to be the meer play-things of time, nor to furni&s;h Satan with materials to carry on his dark de&s;igns and horrid intrigues again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, but to honour and glorify God. Therefore, for this great end and purpo&s;e break off from &s;in of every kind, encourage religion and virtue in each other; carefully attend to the doctrine and advice of your godly teachers; lift up your hearts in your de&s;ires to God, for his holy &s;pi|rit to enlighten and lead you into the truth; clo&s;ely at|tend to the word of God; make it the man of your coun|&s;el. Let all your conduct &s;peak forth your belief of the Deity, and judgment to come; and by becoming holy we &s;hall be a happy people, and &s;hall &s;ee the return of God's ble&s;&s;ings, Satan di&s;appointed and bla&s;ted, and the glorious kingdom of Chri&s;t advancing. I clo&s;e my addre&s;s to you, by heartily recommending to your &s;erious con&s;ideration the great duty of guarding again&s;t tho&s;e dangerous errors, and de&s;tructive delu&s;ions, which lead the mi&s;guided &s;oul into the endle&s;s mazes and winding labyrinths of trouble and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>And may God pre&s;erve you and lead you to him&s;elf, through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with which I clo&s;e, and &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf the publick's real friend, and humble &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the people on this I&s;land began &s;ome time ago to enter into A&s;&s;ociations, in order to defeat the &s;chemes of wicked and corrupt rulers, the King and his Mini&s;ters were much alarmed. A Cabinet Council was held at Whitehall in con&s;equence thereof. There were pre&s;ent among others his Maje&s;ty, Lord Bute (<HI>under the ro&s;e</HI>) Lord North, Lord Germaine, Lord Mansfield, and a well known toryi&s;tical Bi&s;hop. After the debates on this important bu&s;ine&s;s were over; the following conver&s;ati|on or Dialogue took place, which laid that &s;cene of di&s;|turbance and confu&s;ion, which lately took place in this Metropolis, and by which &s;o many innocent per&s;ons un|fortunately lo&s;t their lives: By this conference we are al|&s;o led to the di&s;covery of a low and contemptible &s;cheme for rai&s;ing commotions and di&s;turbing the peace of our brethren in America, by introducing a new, &s;trange and fooli&s;h religion, which, unaccountable as it may &s;eem, it is &s;aid has already created much mi&s;chief in that quarter. The conver&s;ation was began by his Maje&s;ty, and was neaily as follows, viz.</P>

<P>The&s;e A&s;&s;ociations and Committees of
<PB N="29" REF="017681_0028_0FA21E46370B5EA0">corre&s;pondence, now forming with &s;uch rapid progre&s;s in England, appear to be &s;imilar to tho&s;e by which the Ameri|cans fir&s;t dared openly to oppo&s;e our government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mansfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, may it plea&s;e your Ma|je&s;ty, and you cannot be too &s;en&s;ible of the great danger of &s;uch unlawful combinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bute.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I look upon the&s;e mea&s;ures to be worthy of our mo&s;t &s;eri|ous attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty to allow me to expre&s;s my &s;entiments relative to the alarming oppo&s;i|tion now making in this realm to the mea&s;ures we have a|dopted for the &s;ecurity of your Maje&s;ty's government&mdash;For the people in a cool and determined manner to a&s;&s;o|ciate and enter into covenants, and chu&s;e men of proper|ty and influence to pre&s;ide over and direct them in the means of oppo&s;ition to government, appears to me to be big with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are the very mea&s;ures which were taken by the Americans in the beginning of their rebellion. Your Maje&s;ty may recollect their regular ad|vances in this way. Ten thou&s;and mobs could not have done half &s;o much injury to this Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mansfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a ju&s;t maxim, That de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate remedies. Mobs, may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, often produce the be&s;t effects; they tend to &s;trengthen government, and in their con&s;equences to weak|en the oppo&s;ition of the people, as they introduce anar|chy and confu&s;ion, whereby the more &s;erious and &s;en&s;ible part of the community are plundered and ill-treated, which will make them rather &s;ubmit to &s;ome &s;mall infringement of their liberties, than to be harra&s;&s;ed by a mob rai&s;ed out of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t abandoned of the people; and even acknowledge that ab&s;olute government is better than none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t then take the hint, and rai&s;e a mob that will effectually an&s;wer our purpo&s;e at this day.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lords, I look to you for advice in
<PB N="30" REF="017681_0029_0FA21E471BF99B18">this important matter&mdash;if you think it worthy of atten|tion you will plea&s;e to point out the means of redre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bute.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, your faithful &s;ervants now pre&s;ent have devi&s;ed ways and means to counteract tho&s;e dangerous mea&s;ures adopted by the peo|ple; we only want your royal approbation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plea&s;e to make them known to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, we really think it expedient to rai&s;e a mob chiefly out of the lower &s;ort of the people, to be headed by a per&s;on of &s;ome con|&s;equence. This riotous a&s;&s;embly when rai&s;ed may ea&s;ily be led to commit &s;uch outrages as will alarm all the &s;ober and more &s;en&s;ible part of the nation, who will then wi&s;h for and reque&s;t the interpo&s;ition of government. Let mi|litary power be exerted in a proper moment&mdash;a few of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s be taken, and after trial executed, and at the &s;ame time extend mercy to a few who are the lea&s;t attrocious. The riot will then &s;ub&s;ide&mdash;a new face will appear upon our political affairs&mdash;the different pa&s;&s;ions of the people will be wrought upon&mdash;the moderate men will have more influence upon tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition&mdash;the digni|ty of government will acquire new lu&s;tre&mdash;tho&s;e in oppo|&s;ition will loo&s;e ground&mdash;and finally all their plea&s;ing ex|pectations from A&s;&s;ociations, &amp;c. will vani&s;h like the dew upon the ri&s;ing of the morning &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;cheme appears &s;omething plau&s;i|ble&mdash;But how can the matter be properly conducted? For it appears to me to be an exceeding delicate affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, &s;ome tru&s;ty per&s;on or per&s;ons mu&s;t be employed who are favourites of the people;&mdash;your Maje&s;ty's faithful mini&s;ters have al|ready had a conference with Lord Gordon&mdash;he has the petition of the prote&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation in tru&s;t, to pre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty and Parliament again&s;t the bill of Tole|ration, &amp;c. His character an&s;wers to a hair.&mdash;He has agreed if your Maje&s;ty approves the mea&s;ure, to i&s;&s;ue an adverti&s;ement, inviting the people to attend him in pre&s;ent|ing the petition; and we have agreed with a number of
<PB N="31" REF="017681_0030_0FA21E47D77182B8">cunning, artful fellows to influence the mob &s;o a&s;&s;embled to burn a few buildings, &amp;c. at which time we can &s;et on our dogs of war, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bute.</SPEAKER>
<P>And one thing more mu&s;t be done, the leading magi&s;trates in the city mu&s;t be brought into the &s;ecret, otherwi&s;e they will blow up our whole &s;cheme by rai&s;ing the <HI>po&s;&s;e comitatus</HI> on the fir&s;t appearance of Lord Gordon's adverti&s;ement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, a better plan could not be devi&s;ed.&mdash;I thank you my good friends. As for Lord Gordon I will make him &s;hine in due time; he is young and may live to enjoy his earnings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mansfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a&s;&s;ured Lord Gordon that his popularity will be equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions&mdash;and he appears to be well &s;atisfied with the idea of being the darling of the people. Something, however, mu&s;t be done to bring him off from that puni&s;hment, which in the eye of the law he will ju&s;tly merit. It will be proper that he undergo confinement, and &s;tand a trial for his life; but matters being properly managed, there will be no danger of his &s;uffering a greater evil than a confinement for a &s;hort time, and we make no doubt but he will receive full compen&s;ation for that inconvenience by your Maje&s;ty's royal bounty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may rely on my a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;and I think the &s;ooner this plan is put in execution the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is now an excellent time, as we have cau&s;ed &s;uch a clamour to be rai&s;ed again&s;t popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wi&s;h we had as good a plan to &s;ettle our affairs in America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>The people in Great-Britain are plea&s;|ed with the notion of our having a right to tax America; they think it will help to relieve them of their burthens; be&s;ides an Engli&s;h chimney-&s;weeper plumes him&s;elf on his Engli&s;h blood, and thinks he has a right to govern and make laws for America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bute.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty that all our money, blood and trea&s;ure expended there is lo&s;t, and
<PB N="32" REF="017681_0031_0FA21E4883DE7E68">America al&s;o. The money we have expended in bribe|ry &s;eems to have had but little good effect, but few of tho&s;e we have retained appear to act conformable to our wi&s;hes; they &s;eem to have but little courage to &s;tand forth in the defence of our intere&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t make &s;ome allowance for that, our affairs are &s;o ruinous there, that they &s;ee they &s;tand a great chance to be hanged or be obliged to leave their country forever, and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation is one of the fir&s;t laws of nature we all know: But we mu&s;t make u&s;e of every &s;tratagem; we find they an&s;wer when nothing el&s;e will. My Lord <HI>Germaine</HI> has lately had intelligence from &s;ome agents we have lately &s;ent to America, to work upon the &s;uper&s;tition of the people there. They have had tolerable &s;ucce&s;s. My Lord will inform your Maje&s;ty concerning them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord <HI>Germaine</HI> I am all attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, our ac|counts from the per&s;ons who were &s;ent to propagate a new religions &s;cheme in America are very flattering. They make converts daily, and it is merry to hear of the weakne&s;s and folly of their tenets, and how aptly adapt|ed to work on the fooli&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious pa&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t ignorant of the Americans. You mu&s;t note, Sir, they have ever been taught to believe in miracles and &s;uper|natural operations. Their leaders, our agents, who &s;tile them&s;elves elders, profe&s;s to have all the&s;e powers, viz. To heal the &s;ick, lame, wounded, &amp;c. to have the gift of prophe&s;y, divine revelations, and of conver&s;ing in un|known tongues, &amp;c. and to be perfect and infallible; the &s;pirit, as they term it, works upon and agitates their whole bodies; they have holy dances, turnings, &s;hakings of the head and limbs, fall down and have terrible agitati|ons; and many excel &s;o much in the&s;e things, e&s;pecially their converts, that they appear meagre, pale, and their vi&s;ages gha&s;tly; they are taught that they mu&s;t confe&s;s their &s;ins to their elders, and at &s;uch times are inquired of, Whether they have been guilty of taking up arms, which
<PB N="33" REF="017681_0032_0FA21E493367A718">is repre&s;ented as the greate&s;t &s;in; whether they have been guilty of carnal knowledge with brutes; whether they have been guilty of whoredom, and with how many wo|men; whether they have had carnal knowledge of a wo|man in her pregnancy, &amp;c. and at the confe&s;&s;ion of each &s;in kneel and put up ejaculations to Heaven for pardon: The wretched converts to this religion, flock after their teachers, and at certain places are entertained on free co&s;t, and are led to believe that the means of their &s;upport is furni&s;hed in a miraculous manner: This religion, con|temptible as it may appear, is calculated to infatuate weak minds; and tho&s;e who are but little acquainted with the con&s;truction of the human body, really think the teachers of this &s;cheme have power from Heaven to work mira|cles, and never con&s;ider that the violent agitations of their bodies in the execi&s;e of their ab&s;urd &s;hakings, will in par|ticular ca&s;es give a fre&s;h &s;pring to the blood, and cau&s;e a circulation in parts which were before ob&s;tructed; and by means of which people who were before lame, may chance by the violent frenzy they have worked them&s;elves into, cau&s;e a circulation to take place in a lame limb, and and thereby recover the u&s;e of it; this is held up as a real miracle, and does not fail to bring over fre&s;h converts, particularly of tho&s;e who&s;e nerves are weak. They are taught to believe that the time draws near when the whole of the &s;aints &s;hall be &s;ealed, and when the remaining wick|ed, among whom are tho&s;e who have taken arms again&s;t us, &s;hall be de&s;troyed, to make room for the &s;aints to reign with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years. They are great adepts in the u&s;e of the &s;criptures, and never fail to interpret it directly to their purpo&s;e. The&s;e people, if properly increa&s;ed, might be worked up to any thing, and to any purpo&s;e by their leaders, on whom they &s;olely depend for direction, only let them have a divine revelation to take arms and de&s;troy rebels to God, and rebels to man; but I fear we are al|mo&s;t too late in this affair&mdash;we &s;hould have began &s;ooner&mdash;but it may be that we may yet u&s;e the&s;e Shaking
<PB N="34" REF="017681_0033_0FA21E49F3864AD8">Quakers, as they are called, to good advantage&mdash;I look upon them at lea&s;t <HI>late</HI> recruits for Britain.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often been told that the people in &s;ome of the colonies were great bigots in their religion; e&s;peci|ally the di&s;&s;enters&mdash;I am &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed that the&s;e Shaking Quakers &s;hould have any influence on them, e&s;|pecially as they are reputed to be foremo&s;t in the rebelli|on, and great oppo&s;ers to any religious &s;cheme that bears any re&s;emblance to popery.&mdash;Now, if I am rightly in|formed, this new &s;cheme bears a &s;trong re&s;emblance in many particulars to the catholick church&mdash;for in&s;tance, their profe&s;&s;ion of being perfect, infallible, confe&s;&s;ions of &s;in, bodily agitations, out-&s;ide &s;hews, &amp;c. this an&s;wers di|rectly to the mother papal church, together with their power of working miracles, &amp;c. However, if we can but get this &s;cheme to go down, it will have, I believe, a good tendency to cut the &s;inews of their rebellion, as the numerous converts will refu&s;e to bear arms again&s;t the forces &s;ent to &s;ubdue the Americans by your Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>I could wi&s;h the plan might &s;ucceed&mdash;but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not without my doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, our a|gents, the teachers of this &s;trange religion, are very cun|ning, and cover their de&s;igns thick with art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certain from the intelligence we have received&mdash;that the&s;e people have made great progre&s;s in carrying on their plan&mdash;And it is well known that when a people are deluded by an appearance of &s;upernatural power, that great things have and may &s;till be done to|wards bringing them under a proper &s;ubjection to govern|ment, when the force of arms have failed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>All governments that are worth any thing are &s;upported by the influence of the clergy&mdash;no Bi&s;hops, no King, is the old true maxim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bute.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a great friend to the clergy, and am &s;en&s;ible of their importance in the pillars of our &s;tate, no gentlemen have &s;o unanimou&s;ly &s;upported our mea&s;ures
<PB N="35" REF="017681_0034_0FA21E4ACFDA8860">for the recovery of America, as the Lords Spiritual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, we may &s;ee by the ea&s;y manner in which the Americans are taken and duped by tho&s;e &s;hakers, that the bulk of the people there were never fited by wi&s;dom and virtue for freemen; &s;uch ignorant and &s;tupid wretches ought never to be free&mdash;they never acted from any principle of knowledge, founded in their under&s;tandings, in their rebellion and oppo&s;ition to our government; they were dictated by only a few &s;pe|culative men who fore&s;aw the evil of our claims of making laws for them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Germaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you mu&s;t acknowledge that &s;ome of our laws; by which their charters were almo&s;t an|nihilated, and they &s;ubjected to be brought to England for trial, &amp;c. might be &s;een through by weak minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord North.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sir, and were intended to be &s;een by the commonality, you know, Sir, we had our aims by drawing them into rebellion, but con&s;equences have turned out contrary to our expectations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>His Maje&s;ty.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, gentlemen&mdash;I have been waiting for the joyful news of the conque&s;t of the rebels in Ame|rica, and expecting it as a con&s;equence of your councils and mea&s;ures, but have been continually di&s;appointed; it is a&s;&s;urance, gentlemen, that I want, that the work will be &s;oon compleated, and for the want of &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, my &s;oul is almo&s;t &s;tarved. Shall it be &s;aid, that in the reign of George the Third, a native born King of Britain, that America was torn from his Crown! Forbid it Heaven! Forbid it Earth, and all the powers of darkne&s;s: Rather than &s;uch an event &s;hould take place, I would wi&s;h that the whole continent of America might be &s;unk into the bottom of the ocean, or con&s;umed like Sodom with fire and brim&s;tone, and every cur&s;ed rebel in it.</P>
