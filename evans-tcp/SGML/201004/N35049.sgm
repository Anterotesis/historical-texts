<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little book is a part taken from SEVEN PIECES written on the <HI>Mil|lennium,</HI> an&s;wering to the SEVEN <HI>Lamps of Fire burning before the</HI> THRONE OF GOD. Rev. 4.5.&mdash;And to the SEVEN <HI>Trumpets</HI> or <HI>Thunders.</HI> Rev. 10.3.&mdash;As likewi&s;e unto the SEVEN <HI>Spirits of God.</HI> Rev. 1.4.&mdash;The former SEVENS denoting the highe&s;t perfecti|on, or outgoing of JUSTICE. with a double force unto mankind&mdash;the latter SEVEN de|noting the greate&s;t depth of divine MER|CY and GRACE to all who yield to this pre|&s;ent call; as opening a new &s;cene to them within the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, where JUS|TICE and MERCY di&s;play a renewal of ope|ration, each acting &s;o far, or as high, as hu|man beings may bear, without being borne down, or carried away therewith, beyond that balance of per&s;onal freedom which man is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> have in him&s;elf&mdash;in either yielding to the&s;e
<PB N="iv" REF="045865_0004_10207397962576D0">re|newed truths, or in oppo&s;ing them. At this <HI>cri&s;is,</HI> (which is a momentous period,) each intelligent being, whether in the vi&s;ible or in|vi&s;ible worlds, mu&s;t &s;hew to be on one &s;ide or the other, JUSTICE or MERCY then mea|&s;uring accordingly&mdash;not only meeting him as upon his own grounds, <HI>i. e.</HI> on that which he in his own freedom gives, but as carrying him forward, in which ever of the&s;e lines (for or again&s;t this cau&s;e) that he willingly runs.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of this book is in it&s;elf a twofold di&s;play of TRUTH, in the way of JUSTICE and MERCY&mdash;and as belonging to the &s;aid SEVEN PIECES, which take their date from <HI>anno domini</HI> 1783, opens the mo&s;t awful and glorious REVOLUTIONS to the world&mdash;turning round now as it were upon their own centre, viz. the power of God, who confines him&s;elf to his foreknown periodical times, never deviating therefrom in any of his important de&s;igns or fir&s;t eternal plan.</P>

<P>As there were to be two <HI>covenants</HI> for the full completion of the whole de&s;igns of the GOD-HEAD, re&s;pecting man in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;tate of probation in this creation, &s;o

<HEAD>A Divine Call, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS there is natural light, as well as darkne&s;s, two &s;tand|ing oppo&s;ites&mdash;&s;o is there &s;piritual light and &s;piritual darkne&s;s, truth and error, which are ever oppo&s;ing each other; the one flowing from God, as the fountain of light and truth, the other &s;preading out from the devil, as the centre of dark wickedne&s;s, being the father of all &s;ophi&s;m and lies.</P>
<P>GOD has witne&s;&s;es of truth in all circles of the creation.&mdash; each according to order or appointment, bearing te&s;timony to his outgoing and incoming, re&s;pecting the various di&s;|pen&s;ations or di&s;playings of his truth, or true &s;pirit, as well as providence. So &s;atan al&s;o has in&s;truments of error or fal&s;ehood, who, in the &s;pirit of darkne&s;s, run in direct oppo|&s;ition to God's holy light, let the outgoing of its power and te&s;timony be what it will.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t intelligent witne&s;s of God's pure&s;t truth and power placed on this earth, was Adam, who in his per&s;onal office was a prophet, a prie&s;t, and a king, as the true figure of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was afterwards to come in the&s;e charac|ters to redeem the world&mdash;who, upon his coming, &s;hould of nece&s;&s;ity open out a new di&s;pen&s;ation, or change of wor|&s;hip, by his go&s;pel, an&s;werable to the &s;econd <HI>covenant</HI>&mdash;the
<PB N="2" REF="045865_0010_102073A0136C9860">conditions of which, in the mo&s;t true or perfect &s;en&s;e, as well as benefits, were re&s;erved for this go&s;pel's promulgation&mdash;as &s;tanding upon, or ri&s;ing out from, its true head, viz. the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> born into the world&mdash;for before he appeared in per|&s;on, the fulne&s;s of the &s;econd covenant, as belonging to him, and in which he encircled human nature, never could be manife&s;ted&mdash;which covenant was to be revealed to men, and from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hing of that covenant, at the time of Adam's fall or promi&s;e being made, up to the very centre of time that he was to come, in every renewal or the opening out of each new circle of divine light and truth, &s;till pointed unto him, as al&s;o to the manner of his coming, as well as to the period of time, giving the very &s;igns and marks that &s;hould go before, attend and follow.&mdash;All the prophets, as one continued chain of living witne&s;&s;es linked after each other&mdash;as in a twofold row, giving from the &s;pirit of God's own mouth a double te&s;timony, (every eminent prophet having a cotemporary;) the angels of heaven bore witne&s;s al&s;o, upon every occa&s;ion, giving a di&s;tinct and yet joint te&s;timony with all the prophets and wi&s;e men, infolding their double te&s;ti|mony into theirs, making the whole then as a <HI>threefold cord that could not be broken</HI>&mdash;and thus it ran from Adam to the birth of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> at which point of time a ho&s;t from Heaven appeared to &s;everal living witne&s;&s;es, te&s;tifying his birth into this world&mdash;the&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;eeing <HI>him</HI> al&s;o with their eyes.&mdash;</P>
<P>NOR was it at hand, but al&s;o afar off, that his birth was known&mdash;for God's &s;pirit clearly revealed the very time of it to the ea&s;tern philo&s;ophers; and his &s;tar in the elements bore witne&s;s thereto, which they followed, travelling to the place to which his providence led them, till they both beheld and handled him.</P>
<P>SIMEON the prophet, and <HI>Anne</HI> the prophete&s;s, bore wit|ne&s;s to him in the temple, and when an infant, embraced him as the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>&mdash;his divine wi&s;dom (when he was but twelve years old) bore witne&s;s of him before all the learned doctors
<PB N="3" REF="045865_0011_102073DC056948D0">&mdash;His &s;potle&s;s life, before he began his mini&s;try, witne&s;&s;ed him to be the Son of God, becau&s;e no man lived free from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion but he.&mdash;The Me&s;&s;iah was to have a forerun|ner or herald, to prepare his was&mdash;and his <HI>be</HI> had, viz. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, who was in honour greater than all the forerunning prophets, becau&s;e he could point with his finger to the only begotten &s;on of God, in per&s;on then on the &s;pot, who was come to take away the &s;ins of the world by the &s;a|crifice of him&s;elf.&mdash;John was commi&s;&s;ioned to attend up|on his initiation into public office, which was an honour pe|culiarly re&s;erved for him.&mdash;Now this John was acknow|ledged to be a true prophet, and revered as &s;uch by all that nation at fir&s;t, but &s;ome were a little after hardened in wick|edne&s;s to maliciou&s;ly bate that truth and divine purity in him that they could not deny&mdash;for if John was not true in his te&s;timony of the Me&s;&s;iah, all the prophets from the begin|ning mu&s;t be fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;God the father bore witne&s;s to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by an audible voice from Heaven, &s;aying, <HI>"This is my beloved &s;on,"</HI> and God the Holy Gho&s;t bore witne&s;s al&s;o, openly de&s;cending on him&mdash;And here the ble&s;&s;ed TRINITY vi&s;ibly meets on or in his per&s;on, in one point of unity, what could not be &s;een in any &s;uch &s;en&s;e ever before, that mani|fe&s;tation being re&s;erved for that period of opening the new di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;for the&s;e extraordinary openings could not be to the world, until that the only begotten &s;on of God came to dwell as a creature in it&mdash;then the <HI>father</HI> could no longer conceal him&s;elf in the&s;e glorious manife&s;tations from the world&mdash;becau&s;e where the &s;on of his love was, there he &s;hould be, as in his fulle&s;t pre&s;ence, and where that is, it cannot but be known&mdash;and the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive demon&s;tra|tion &s;hould be given on his dedication to the go&s;pel mini&s;try, that being his &s;ealing into office.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible for John to be a &s;al&s;e witne&s;s herein, becau&s;e if &s;o, all the prophets mu&s;t be liars, who exactly agree with him in pointing out the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to the world; and if the&s;e could not be liars, how much le&s;s could God the father&mdash;and when he &s;aid Je&s;us was his <HI>only</HI> begotten &s;on,
<PB N="4" REF="045865_0012_102073A414F81A60">would not he be a liar if that he was not his &s;on&mdash;and this of Je&s;us being the true &s;on of God, was declared in the hearing of other witne&s;&s;es, upon another occa&s;ion, by the audible voice of God him&s;elf, &s;peaking from Heaven, who &s;aw with their bodily eyes his divine glory &s;hining through the vail of his fle&s;h, even too glorious to be looked upon, how much le&s;s then to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>IF Je&s;us of Nazareth was not the true Me&s;&s;iah, the Holy Gho&s;t mu&s;t be a deceiver&mdash;not only at his birth, bapti&s;m and transfiguration, but during the whole cour&s;e of his life, par|ticularly that of his public mini&s;try, and that not only through the means of his words, (truth it&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>no man ever &s;pake like him,</HI>) but al&s;o through the works which he did, for no man ever before did the like&mdash;no, nor &s;ince, even in any &s;ort of compari&s;on, &s;ave by his power or divine appointment to peculiar per&s;ons cho&s;en to work wonderou&s;ly in his name&mdash;and the many glorious works his &s;ervants have wrought by his power with them, yet never equal to his, in intrin&s;ic value.&mdash;Devils became not only &s;ubject to his power, but trembled and fled at the very found of his name when expre&s;&s;ed by others&mdash;acknowledging him to be the true Me&s;|&s;iah, and holy one of God; and men who deny him to be that per&s;on, and re&s;i&s;t &s;elf conviction, act even wor&s;e than does Satan, which &s;ully proves that there are many embodied &s;pirits on earth, more di&s;ingenuous than &s;ome di&s;embodied fiends in bell.</P>
<P>TO the JEWS were committed, not only the revealed law, and divine ordinances, but the living prophets of God, as the mo&s;t lively images of his &s;on, rai&s;ed up in regular cour&s;e from time to time among&s;t them&mdash;and though often di&s;approving of their te&s;timony, yet they were never in point of truth able to contradict them.&mdash;All the&s;e prophets in ge|neral, one after the other, were mo&s;t inhumanly murdered for te&s;tifying again&s;t the vice of the&s;e people. So the very heads of this nation, or in other words the reigning &s;pirit of that whole body, ro&s;e &s;till from one generation to another to
<PB N="5" REF="045865_0013_102073E03B5C1350">be as wicked comparatively as the powers of the infernal re|gion. The JEWS do not deny but they put the holy pro|phets to death, and yet cannot &s;ay that they &s;lew them for their wickedne&s;s; and as the la&s;t of the ancient Prophets, or <HI>head</HI> of all, the Father of Heaven, <HI>&s;ent them down his only begotten Son</HI> to turn them from the error of dark wickedne&s;s unto the true&s;t light or holy knowledge of him&s;elf. His di|vine precepts, both in their deep purity and power, fully proved him to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> his miraculous works on others, as well as the miraculous events that &s;till attended him, proved him altogether &s;o &s;upernatural, that they had no way under heaven to deny him, but by alleging all this &s;u|perabundant goodne&s;s, or &s;upernatural power, as coming wholly from Belzebub within him.&mdash;O! deluded nation, when did the Devil become &s;uch a benefactor to men? It is well known that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> di&s;covered his power of giving life unto tho&s;e who were totally dead, and brought the &s;ouls of &s;ome, back again, into their bodies, after being long in the invi&s;ible world; of this there were different in&s;tances, viz. rai&s;ing a dead per&s;on to life, who&s;e corp&s;e was &s;tretched and laid out&mdash;a &s;econd, who was carried on a bier, to be buried&mdash; and a third, who lay four days in the grave. Often he open|ed the eyes of grown per&s;ons who were born blind; made tho&s;e who were always before dumb and deaf, to hear and &s;peak; the lame or dead limbed, at his word, would leap up and walk with all natural liveline&s;s, the bowed down or paralytic he delivered from all &s;uch infirmity, the incurable lepers clean&s;ed at his word&mdash;in &s;hort, be gave in&s;tances of his almighty power in repeatedly curing di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds, on the bodies and &s;ouls of men, without any medicine whatever, by his touch, (nay by the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on even touching his garment,) by his word, on tho&s;e who heard, or by his intention to tho&s;e who were afar off. The&s;e are notorious facts, &s;een, heard and witne&s;&s;ed, by an innu|merable number of &s;pectators. He fed at different times, &s;e|veral thou&s;ands, in the barren wilderne&s;s, having only a few &s;mall loaves and two or three little fi&s;hes&mdash;his Di&s;ciples taking the bread from his hands and &s;tretching it unto the heads of
<PB N="6" REF="045865_0014_102073A5B37D32B8">the ranks, as they &s;at around, who found it to increa&s;e as they brake it then one to the other; nor was it le&s;&s;ened even after they had eat of it to their full &s;atisfaction, for the remaining fragments were more than was the whole bread, before be miraculou&s;ly increa&s;ed it to them; and while he could feed hundreds and thou&s;ands to their full &s;atisfaction, upon ever &s;o trifling a mor&s;el, yet he him&s;elf could live without any na|tural food; an in&s;tance of which is given in his fa&s;ting, in a wilderne&s;s forty days and forty nights together. Nor was it only in his own natural body he did this, but al&s;o enabled others, viz. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elijah,</HI> by his &s;upernatural power upon them, even hundreds of years before his coming in the fle&s;h, to fa&s;t the &s;ame length of time, as two di&s;tinct types, figuring or referring to what him&s;elf &s;hould do, when he would come. The&s;e being appointed, each one in his day, a &s;triking &s;ign of him, as forerunning &s;ervants unto him who is <HI>Lord of all.</HI> It was his divine power that rai&s;ed up and pre&s;erved the holy fathers, who all lived according to ap|pointment <HI>with a &s;ingle eye to him;</HI> it was <HI>he</HI> who brought all I&s;rael, with a high hand, up out of Egypt; (yet afterwards murdered him as touching his human per&s;on,) led them on dry ground, through the red Sea; overthrew their enemies; bore with their di&s;obedience, in the wilderne&s;s, forty years; fed and nouri&s;hed them all that time in a &s;upernatural man|ner, bringing them into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a land flowing with milk and honey.</P>
<P>BEING the &s;econd in the divine plurality, and in point of unity&mdash;God of the whole creation.

All truths that in anywi&s;e related hereto, as well as vi&s;ible demon&s;tration, meeting in the one point, or per&s;on of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> evidenced him to be the &s;on of God: Nor was it po&s;&s;i|ble that any one inferior to that <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> could lay down his life for the&s;e his bitter enemies, purcha&s;ing the love of God for his murderers, by the pouring out of that blood which they were &s;pilling, and the free pardon of Heaven for every &s;in|ner, who would believe in his goodne&s;s, and yield to the in|fluence of his grace, which &s;trove then with his murderers, and continues to &s;trive for a certain period, to reclaim all, men, even the mo&s;t abandoned &s;inners; and if laying down his very life for his enemies, evidenced him to be that per|&s;on, how much more does his ri&s;ing from the dead, in which be takes that life into him again. The angels who attended his coming forth from the tomb, in the very order of their waiting upon him, evidence him to be the Son of God; the

When he was ri&s;en from the dead, they could not &s;ay he was then in the tomb, and yet by &s;hutting it up and keeping it &s;o, they could better pa&s;s the cheat upon the world, than by &s;uch an ill framed lie, that had not even the &s;malle&s;t probability: They were broad awake, and yet they could not hinder him from ri&s;ing!

His &s;ending down the Holy Gho&s;t, even vi&s;ibly on his Di&s;ciples, evidences him to be the living God, <HI>one with the Father,</HI> and the &s;upernatural power that was publicly known to remain with them, proved to a de|mon&s;tration, that through him they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Holy Gho&s;t &mdash;enabling them in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to &s;peak all kinds of lan|guages&mdash;cure all manner of di&s;ea&s;es without any fort of me|dicine, by their word, or by their &s;hadow, and even by handkerchiefs or aprons only touching one of the&s;e per&s;ons, and carried ever &s;o far to the &s;ick, were then recovered in laying the &s;ame upon them&mdash;al&s;o their rai&s;ing the dead to like again by his name, their ca&s;ting out Devils; converting

<P>THE Prophet Micah, 5 chap. 2. ver. in the old te&s;ta|ment, foretold him to be born at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and Saint Mat|thew and Saint Luke's go&s;pel, of the new te&s;tament, &s;hews he was born there, and the inhuman ma&s;&s;acre of the young infants gave cau&s;e for a public remembrance of that to be the very place of his birth, as al&s;o the time of it. The Pro|phet Malachi, &s;peaking the language of Chri&s;t's &s;pirit, &s;ays, "<HI>behold I &s;end my me&s;&s;enger,</HI> (John the bapti&s;t) <HI>and he &s;hall prepare the way before me;</HI>" and &s;o he did, for John came before him into this world, and al&s;o began his mini&s;try be|fore, as the go&s;pel evidences, and the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> de|&s;cribes John in that public office, <HI>"crying in the wilderne&s;s, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make &s;traight a high way for our God."</HI> Now if Chri&s;t was not the Lord or true God, this Prophet mu&s;t be all along a liar. And the go&s;pel &s;hews how exactly all this was fulfilled&mdash;And the public alarm that was given by John's preaching, was well known to all the countries about Judea, for it was of him the Prophet Mala|chi &s;peaks, where he &s;ays in the word of God, <HI>behold I will

It was &s;aid of Elijah, <HI>that he &s;tood up as a fire, and that his word burned like a lamp</HI>&mdash;Eccle&s;. 48, 1. And the &s;on of God &s;aid of John <HI>that he was a burning and a &s;hining light.</HI> The one did not fear to reprove king <HI>Ahab,</HI> nor the other to reprove king Herod&mdash;the one forced to fly from Ahab's wi&s;e, who would have put him to death&mdash;the other put to death by the in&s;tigation of the wi&s;e of Herod.&mdash; And as Elijah was the true figure of John, &s;o was John a true figure of the &s;on of God, and the very nighe&s;t to Chri&s;t in preparing men for the kingdom of heaven. John baptized with water, as &s;etting men cleanly apart for-God's kingdom, and Chri&s;t, as the only true God, baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, taking them into it. John's circle of action therein was his la&s;t three and a half years, and the cour&s;e of Chri&s;t's public mini&s;try in his body of fle&s;h, was his la&s;t three and a half years al&s;o.

<P>THE go&s;pel of the new te&s;tament &s;hews he was cruci|fied between two thieves, and the &s;pirit of the Prophet, hun|dreds of years before that, in the old te&s;tament, eyed him in that &s;ituation.

By the go&s;pel of the new te&s;tament, his re&s;urrec|tion in every circum&s;tance is plainly &s;hewed, to which the&s;e very guards of wicked men gave affirmation, as eye-win ne&s;les of it, and their framing a lie afterwards to the contra|ry remains &s;till only a negative te&s;timony to the &s;ame&mdash;and did not the Holy Gho&s;t fore&s;hew his re&s;urrection, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> is &s;aid by the prophet, in the old te&s;tament, <HI>thou wilt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> leave my &s;oul in Hell,</HI> (Hades, or the place of &s;eparate &s;pi|rits,) <HI>i. e.</HI> to remain long &s;eparate from the body, <HI>neither wilt thou &s;uffer the body,</HI> though &s;eparated from the &s;oul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> thy holy one, <HI>to &s;ee corruption.</HI> P&s;a. 16, 10.</P>

THE very truth of the new te&s;tament manife&s;ts his a&s;|cen&s;ion into Heaven, there being a va&s;t number of living witne&s;&s;es beholding him with their eyes, going up, <HI>till the clouds received him out of their &s;ight,</HI> and this was only ful|filling what the holy &s;pirit declared in the old, when, by the mouth of David, it cries, <HI>lift up your heads, O! ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everla&s;ting doors, and the king of glary &s;hall come in</HI>&mdash;P&s;a. 24, 9. This text fully &s;hews that the Prophet was by no means &s;peaking of him&s;elf, but of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the everla&s;ting King of glory, who thus a&s;cended up to the eternal Heavens. And if God had not come down in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, dwelling bodily in him, he could not, in the language of truth, be &s;aid to a&s;cend up, to take his glory above. The &s;ame Prophet Tpeaks of him as having actually gone up in triumph, where he &s;ays, "<HI>thou art gone up on high, thou ha&s;t led captivity captive, and received gifts for men,</HI> not for him&s;elf; and to this the new te&s;tament bears witne&s;s by the miraculous power of the&s;e &s;piritual gifts, which men received, as do al&s;o the doctrines of grace and purity, in or upon tho&s;e who truly obey the go&s;pel of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and all being thus, as in the la&s;t &s;entence, brought home to a point, into the very centre of man's in|ward feeling, he mu&s;t know the&s;e things to be true, and before ever his con&s;cience can be brought to di&s;credit any of the&s;e fundamental truths, re&s;pecting the incarnation of the Son of God, and full redemption of mankind through him, he mu&s;t be fir&s;t per&s;uaded that he has no lively feeling nor exi&s;tence, and that never could be, becau&s;e while he is ca|pable of knowledge he has both life and feeling. So &s;trong, conclu&s;ive, and &s;elf evident, has God made the clear light of his go&s;pel truth upon the &s;ouls of all men, that no man can peri&s;h, but in wilfully per&s;i&s;ting in &s;in, ever again&s;t the true light of the go&s;pel &s;pirit that &s;hines unto him, and appears within him, knowing him&s;elf to be oppo&s;ing God's &s;aving truth, and al&s;o perverting his own under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE harmony that is between the old and the new te&s;taments is worthy the admiration of angels; how much

<P>ALL the &s;criptures of the old te&s;tament that related to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> were in the only full or true&s;t &s;en&s;e accompli&s;h|ed in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> at the very head of the go&s;pel, as failing all within the circle of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, into which the&s;e prophecies &s;hould launch, and by no other per&s;on, nor at any other point of time, could the&s;e &s;criptures be accom|pli&s;hed, el&s;e all prophecy is fal&s;e. And not barely through the words of a Prophet, but from the very mouth of an <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> of the fir&s;t Heavenly order, was conveyed to <HI>Daniel,</HI> and through him to all men, the very <HI>time</HI> that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould come, and be al&s;o cut off for his people; and where all this has been fulfilled, even to the la&s;t exactne&s;s, taking in all the&s;e prophecies within that point of time, and in that very per&s;on, agreeable to the report of that <HI>Angel,</HI> it does not leave even the &s;malle&s;t room for people to conceit any thing to the contrary.</P>
<P>That <HI>Angel</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Daniel, "&s;eventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, and to make an end of &s;ins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eal up the vi&s;ion and prophecy, and to anoint the mo&s;t holy,"</HI> even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the mo&s;t holy God; or that Angel is a liar. Here this Angel delivers the whole circle or cour&s;e of the time, counting a day for a year, in which all the&s;e things in their full or true&s;t heads were to be accompli&s;hed. He then divides that circle of &s;eventy weeks (or 490 years) into three di&s;tinct periods, viz. <HI>&s;even weeks&mdash;&s;ixty-two weeks&mdash;and one week,</HI> and fully explains what &s;hould be accompli&s;hed in each of the&s;e di&s;tinctly, one after the other, to the fulfilment of the whole 490 years, counting from the &s;eventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in which a commandment was to go forth from God, through the mouth of that King, unto
<PB N="19" REF="045865_0027_102073F335C3CF28"><HI>Ezra,</HI> to re&s;tore and build again the walls and city of Jeru|&s;alem, which was completed by Nehemiah in the fir&s;t &s;even weeks period of forty-nine years, reckoning from the date of that command. Ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of <HI>three &s;core and two weeks,</HI> or 434 years after, which was the &s;econd period, making in all 483 years, <HI>John</HI> came preaching in the wil|derne&s;s, the 26th year of Chri&s;t; then there remained but the third period, viz. <HI>one week,</HI> or &s;even years of the whole 490; and this one week was particularly &s;ingled out, and chiefly pointed at by the Angel as the crowning of all; for the Me&s;|&s;iah could not be cut off, within the &s;econd period, nor until the clo&s;e of the third, for he &s;aid, "<HI>and after</HI> (not before) <HI>three &s;core and two weeks,</HI> from the fini&s;hing of Jeru&s;alem, <HI>&s;hall Me&s;&s;iah be cut off,</HI>" viz. at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t week, and then a particular account follows of what was to be ac|compli&s;hed by the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his forerunner the&s;e &s;even years, allowing three and a half years to each, to wit: "<HI>He &s;hall confirm the covenant</HI> (of the go&s;pel light) <HI>with many for one week,</HI> (even as many as did receive it,) <HI>and in the mid&s;t of the week,</HI> (namely, when Chri&s;t began to preach)&mdash;<HI>he &s;hall cau&s;e the &s;acrifice and oblation to cea&s;e,</HI> (Jewi&s;h ceremonies never more to be accounted the true wor&s;hip of God,) <HI>and for the over&s;preading of abominations, he &s;hall make it de&s;olate, even until the con&s;ummation of the whole; and that determined &s;hall be poured upon the de&s;olate</HI>"&mdash;And has not all this been known to be exactly and fully accompli&s;hed, before the face of the world?</P>
<P>THE prophetic accounts of the Me&s;&s;iah's actions, &s;uffer|ings and death, are &s;o wonderfully minute and exact, that they look altogether more like a hi&s;tory than prophecies, re|&s;embling more a copy drawn from the events, than a predic|tion of them; and yet the&s;e prophecies were written &s;everal hundred years before his coming; and as an additional evi|dence in &s;avour of the&s;e &s;criptures, they were in the keeping of the enemies of the go&s;pel, who hated and de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and at that foreknown point of time crucified him&mdash;being at once both the pre&s;ervers and accompli&s;hers of the very
<PB N="20" REF="045865_0028_102073B9177F4628">prophecies, which their own wilful blindne&s;s would not let them &s;ee fulfilled, and God ju&s;tly gave them up thereto.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t grand and extended view, this <HI>Angel</HI> (who conver&s;ed with <HI>Daniel</HI>) gathers up all as into one head, in which he &s;hews the full atonement to be made for the &s;ins of the whole world, viz. <HI>"to fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make an end of &s;ins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to &s;eal up the vi&s;ion"</HI> of all the prophecies of the old te&s;tament concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, being all directed to this as their central point. He then, as within this one great head, or upon the grounds of it, parti|cularizes every thing nece&s;&s;ary, whereby the fulfilment there|of might be clearly known, from his foregoing de&s;cription, including al&s;o within the&s;e &s;eventy weeks the removal of the &s;ceptre from Judah, and after the end of that &s;pace of time how the Romans were to de&s;troy Jeru&s;alem, as al&s;o the de&s;o|lating mi&s;ery, or long &s;cene of misfortunes, that were to fol|low that nation for wickedly rejecting their <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI></P>
<P>IN this one revelation to Daniel, was determined fir&s;t, the very point of time, that Chri&s;t was to be born into this world, &s;econdly, the exact time, he was to enter into his mini&s;try, and thirdly, the in&s;tant of time, he was to be cut off for the &s;ins or his people, and may be well termed one of the noble&s;t prophe|cies in all the old te&s;tament, this intelligence not being con|veyed to the Prophet in the ordinary line, but the mo&s;t extra|ordinary, and in that &s;en&s;e ri&s;es to the highe&s;t head of cleare&s;t knowledge, receiving it all from the very mouth of the <HI>Arch|angel,</HI> whom he beheld face to face, and with whom he freely conver&s;ed; and that great <HI>Angel</HI> always addre&s;&s;ed Daniel as a man mightily beloved of God for his great piety and truth, which love to him was made manife&s;t, where God changed the very nature of the lions, &s;o that, in&s;tead of de&s;troying him, as was de&s;igned, they fawned upon him, when he was ca&s;t down into their <HI>den;</HI> and that his light far exceeded all the Prophets in di&s;cerning particular periods in which the mo&s;t extraordinary events were to happen, and giving an account
<PB N="21" REF="045865_0029_102073F4D80830F0">of the number of years that <HI>reached</HI> to each, is <HI>very</HI> evident as al&s;o the amazing extent of his views, and &s;o far as things have had time to come about, or follow in cour&s;e, his pro|phecies have been &s;o far fulfilled to the nice&s;t exactne&s;s; and in point of freedom with the Almighty he &s;tands not a whit below any man, but was, in this re&s;pect, a &s;triking figure or type of Chri&s;t; he conver&s;ed freely with God him&s;elf in the per&s;on of the <HI>Angel of the covenant,</HI> afterwards manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h as the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and that <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> has named him <HI>Daniel the Prophet,</HI> and the Holy Gho&s;t has &s;ignified him, in Zek. 14, 20, to be one of the greate&s;t worth in the &s;ight of God. If Daniel was liable to err in his judgment, yet the <HI>Arch Angel</HI> could not err in his commi&s;&s;ion; and how much le&s;s could the <HI>Angel of the covenant,</HI> or God him&s;elf, who confirmed the&s;e truths unto him, and when all the Prophets bear witne&s;s hereto, in the mo&s;t exact harmony, and that the fulfilment of all has been truly accompli&s;hed before the face of the world, there cannot then be the lea&s;t room left for any error in all the&s;e accounts of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his go&s;pel kingdom, neither can the truth of tho&s;e which have been long &s;ince fulfilled be now di&s;puted, for tho&s;e prophe&s;ies which are now fulfilling evidences the truth of tho&s;e which have been already fulfilled. Daniel's prophecies are this ve|ry moment fulfilling, and &s;o are all the extended prophecies of the old te&s;tament which reached into this go&s;pel era, where men now &s;tand, for the go&s;pel <HI>time</HI> now &s;urrounds all, being come to its middle <HI>point,</HI> in which there mu&s;t be a ge|neral change or turning round, and unto which the whole old te&s;tament does lend its &s;trength to a&s;&s;i&s;t that change&mdash; &s;tanding no longer, as it were, upon its own legs or old grounds, but as uniting with that is entirely new, and &s;hall bring forth a new &s;cene in its pre&s;ent revolution throughout the world, turning about as it were upon its own centre, yet this &s;trength, or &s;trong revolve of the go&s;|pel, is not upon any thing old, but upon that which is now, in its pre&s;ent motion. Though the old te&s;tament was written long before the new, to which is bears a forerun|ning witne&s;s, yet the new te&s;tament fully proves it&s;elf to
<PB N="22" REF="045865_0030_102073BADC7B0BD0">be diving, without a dependence on the old for that proof. The old te&s;tament, con&s;idered altogether in it&s;elf, is but one witne&s;s&mdash;and in the nature of things there could not but be a &s;econd in that order&mdash;for God would not leave him&s;elf without a &s;econd witne&s;s therein. And that the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation has &s;ufficiently proved it&s;elf, may be now fully known from all the true grounds already opened in the circular cour&s;es of its twofold order, exactly corre&s;pondent to that foreknowledge, which at its fir&s;t head was di&s;played by nu|merous predictions&mdash;and the full completion of the&s;e pre|dictions not only prove the go&s;pel true, but al&s;o manife&s;ts its divine independence to any thing el&s;e for that proof. The prophecies of the new te&s;tament, corre&s;ponding exactly with the occurrencies of the&s;e &s;eventeen or eighteen hundred years pa&s;t, plainly di&s;covers that this go&s;pel of the new te&s;tament is divine, and totally independent to the old te&s;tament for any &s;upport, which proves its head <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> to be GOD, and al&s;o &s;hews, that all the revolutions on the whole face of this creation &s;ince the commencement of the go&s;pel <HI>era,</HI> de|pended upon it, as lying in, and proceeding from, the womb of God, who&s;e providential power over-ruleth all things; and through the <HI>wi&s;dom, mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tlce,</HI> of the go&s;pel, is his pre&s;ence di&s;played, the true picture of which in matter and miniature, was his veil of fle&s;h; nor is there any know|ing or huding him out, but as in the truth of that go&s;pel, for through this alone be di&s;plays his attributes; fir&s;t, in the light of his <HI>&s;pirit;</HI> &s;econdly, through the doctrines and pre|cepts of the &s;cripture <HI>word;</HI> and thirdly, the revolving and wondrous occurrences of <HI>Providence;</HI> and it is through the&s;e that men can &s;ee him, and through which, in all the depths of divine wi&s;dom, he mini&s;ters both <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to all pations, as well as individuals. Not even a devil in hell can with any face, &s;ay, but there have many things occurred in this world the&s;e eighteen hundred years pa&s;t, and that all the&s;e momentous things have been con&s;i&s;tent with the pro|phecies of the new te&s;tament, is what the powers of darkne&s;s cannot deny&mdash;Therefore all that has occurred throughout the whole world the&s;e eighteen hundred years, is one conti|nued
