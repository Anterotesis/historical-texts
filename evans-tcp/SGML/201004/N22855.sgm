<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE bolde&s;t adventurers in reform|ing efforts, were never fortified with &s;ufficient temerity to adopt a &s;y&s;tem of religion truly rational or &s;ublime. In all ages of the world, the mind of man has been pre&s;cribed to certain rules; a deviation from which would incur the &s;evere&s;t penalties of per&s;ecution, and pro&s;cription. It is true however, that new religions have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; fre&s;h ideas brought forward; rights, ri|tuals, and ceremonies altered; but the&s;e were trifling improvements upon the ge|neral principles of common error; no|thing having yet appeared truly ration|al, in the production of our mo&s;t cele|brated reformers.</P>
<P>Sect has generated &s;ect, error produ|cing error, till at length Chri&s;tians are divided into as many parties as the In|dian tribes, and carry their &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="iv" REF="030192_0004_0FE50975280D5F48">
&s;cruples to &s;uch a length, as to exclude rea&s;on, as being incompatible with re|ligion. But tho&s;e who wor&s;hip the De|ity, contrary to the dictates of rea&s;on, mu&s;t do it conformable to the rude cu&s;|tom of irrational, and &s;avage barbarity, and may be compared to the men of Li&s;tra, to whom, Paul &s;aid "Him therefore ye ignorantly wor&s;hip declare I unto you."</P>
<P>Were our modern &s;ectaries, who pre|tend to a &s;uperior refinement in the knowledge of &s;criptural &s;cience, permit|ted to controul opinion, how dark and gloomy, how dull and unintere&s;ting to a rational and intelligent being, would all religious treati&s;es appear? And the author of the following &s;heets would &s;uffer a per&s;ecution, no le&s;s rigorous than tho&s;e in&s;tituted under the influence of the Popes; and receive as dreadful a &s;entence of pro&s;cription as tho&s;e pro|nounced by the pious directors of the
<PB N="v" REF="030192_0005_0FE50976B2657D40">
Inqui&s;ition. To &s;uch a length would chri&s;tian charity be extended by tho&s;e who are intoxicated with the pernicious draughts admini&s;tered by a my&s;terious religion to its blind votaries. But &s;ince opinion is in &s;ome mea&s;ure free, no|thing &s;hould deter us from propagating &s;entiments intere&s;ting to the human race.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the chains of monk|i&s;h policy broken, and the mind of man permitted to explore the wide empire of rea&s;on, than an important truth was di&s;covered, that an e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, is an e&s;tabli&s;hed tyranny; and if phi|lo&s;ophers would pur&s;ue their &s;pecula|tions, they would find that all po&s;itive in&s;titutions of religion, are but a &s;anc|tified policy, which with propriety may be con&s;idered a holy deception, or a pious fraud. There is no religion ex|tant de&s;titute of able advocates; an In|dian
<PB N="vi" REF="030192_0006_0FE50979C1337AD8">
Fakier, or a Turki&s;h Mufty, will defend his faith, with equal confidence, as an Engli&s;h bi&s;hop will &s;upport the trinity, or the divinity of Chri&s;t. Nor do I know any religion that would fall, for want of &s;upporters, were they re|warded equal to a Briti&s;h prelate.</P>
<P>How mu&s;t every human heart &s;ym|pathize at the recollection of tho&s;e e|normities perpetrated under the &s;peci|ous name of religion&mdash;under the mild banner of a human God: tho&s;e plots and con&s;piracies formed to propagate a divine &s;y&s;tem; the&s;e holy ma&s;&s;acres in&s;tituted to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief in holy writ, and tho&s;e rewards given to catho|lic murderers to de&s;troy unbelieving heretics. But St. Dominic's flaming faggots are finally con&s;umed; the fires of Smithfield are extingui&s;hed; the dazzling &s;word of fanataci&s;m is blunted; tho&s;e gibbets exhibiting the carca&s;&s;es of &s;laughtered heretics, to adorn the
<PB N="vii" REF="030192_0007_0FE509839982CAD0">
mother of Chri&s;tianity, and of Rome, are mouldered into du&s;t, the &s;ublime wor&s;hip of &s;aints, and the pious ado|ration of Idols, is left to our own di&s;|cretion. Religious liberty, and the freedom of con&s;cience, is e&s;tabli&s;hed among us upon a pure and rational ba&s;is.</P>
<P>Let us then, in the name of GOD, remedy prevailing error, and remove &s;tale prejudices, by contemplating boundle&s;s creation, which perpetually exhibits its captivating wonders around us, let us give free operation to the ex|erci&s;e of rea&s;on, and improve tho&s;e mo|ral faculties conferred on us from a &s;ource unknown; and finally, let us confide in a beneficient DEITY, to crown our labours with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHRISTIANITY CONTRASTED WITH DEISM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man feels him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of new ideas, or embraces &s;entiments on cele&s;tial or ter|re&s;tial objects, uncommon among the great ma&s;s of vulgar, he al&s;o feels, by natural in&s;tinct a pro|pen&s;ity to lay them before the public, for the in&s;pection of a regenerated people, recently e|merged from the &s;hackles impo&s;ed on them by knaves and impo&s;tors. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, I embark in the ardous ta&s;k of being the public oppo&s;er of popular errors; tru&s;ting at the &s;ame time, that in expo&s;ing tho&s;e religious foibles, to which deluded mankind are too fondly addicted, I &s;hall not in&s;ult the good under&s;tanding of the well informed, nor abu&s;e that &s;cope of rea&s;on which kind nature has conferred upon me.</P>
<P>Could we but glance at futurity with equal fa|cility as we view the actions of pa&s;t generations, how would our &s;ouls be exalted on contemplating po&s;terity, at &s;o great a remove from rude barbarity, advancing by gradual &s;teps to a more natural
<PB N="10" REF="030192_0009_0FE50985E5BE1FE8">
image of that perfection, which brightens the features of humanity, and exalts man to tho&s;e high &s;tations in human life, allotted him by his divine Creator.</P>
<P>Situated as we are in the middle pa&s;&s;age be|tween the future and the pa&s;t, we cannot but look forward with con&s;oling avidity on the rapid progre&s;s of human perfection, for, however re|tarded in its progre&s;s, by a combination of kings and prie&s;ts, it has neverthele&s;s &s;ucceeded in ar|re&s;ting &s;ceptres from the one, and mitres from the other.</P>
<P>The almighty ho&s;t of rea&s;on and of truth &s;trikes deep at the root of evil, while ambiguous prie&s;ts and their armies of &s;piritual &s;laves, grope in the ob&s;cure cells of fable and of mi&s;tery.</P>
<P>When we take a pro&s;pect of the pa&s;t ages of the world, and recount the numberle&s;s enormities committed under the high-&s;ounding &s;anction of a revealed religion, human nature recoils, and our &s;ouls revolt again&s;t &s;o unnatural a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>A liberal education, aided by rational liberty, and the light of rea&s;on, emboldens men to ha|zard opinions, at the pre&s;ent day, for which, in times of yore, the inqui&s;itorial decrees of a vicious prie&s;thood would con&s;ign him to the dungeon,
<PB N="11" REF="030192_0010_0FE50988E283FFA0">
and his works to the flames. But as the&s;e ob|&s;tacles to human improvements are &s;urmounted, and the &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip paid to crowns and mitres, nearly aboli&s;hed; let us, while we reflect on pa&s;t folly, endeavour to improve on modern wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>It would be the work of a voluminous hi&s;tory to deliniate the errors of former ages, the wars and ma&s;&s;acrees, fomented by one faction of prie&s;t|hood again&s;t another, each profe&s;&s;ing divine theological in&s;piration; the &s;tretch of princely power, the cruelties exerci&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h reli|gious tenets, the &s;hifts and &s;tratagems re&s;orted to, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;eal with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">vine impre&s;&s;ion, the doctrine of the victorious party; and the unnatural edicts of kings and national governors, to bind men down to the&s;e tenets, under pain of confi&s;cation and excommunication, &amp;c. All the&s;e being foreign to my pre&s;ent plan, I &s;hall proceed briefly to &s;tate &s;ome ge|neral objections to prevailing error, and leave this age of philo&s;ophy to draw its own conclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our deluded ance&s;tors were, for the mo&s;t part, incapable of di&s;criminating between &s;ound rea&s;on and ambiguous &s;ophi&s;try, nor was holy
<PB N="12" REF="030192_0011_0FE5098CEEF34980">
writ more revered by them, than doubtful tra|dition, or human invention. Stories the mo&s;t idle, and doctrines the mo&s;t repugnant to na|ture and rea&s;on, never wanted legions of advo|cates; and cold &s;teel, or flaming faggots, were applied as the cure of unbelief; hence &s;prung fa|nati&s;m and phren&s;y, the offspring of a &s;y&s;tema|tic ignorance e&s;tabli&s;hed duplicity, art and im|po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The infatuated men of old, who idolized and adored the prophetic hi&s;tory, firmly believed it to be the hand writing of an unerring God, and yielding an implicit obedience to the inter|pretation of their Prie&s;ts, conceived it too bold and pre&s;umptuous to rea&s;on for them&s;elves, till at length they in&s;en&s;ibly &s;unk into a blind tho' tyrannic &s;y&s;tem of orthodoxy; which kept the world in chains of ignorance for many centuries. No &s;ooner did a bold adventurer rou&s;e from the bed of theology and &s;tart objections to the cor|rupt doctrines of the times, but he was &s;ilenced by an imperious, &s;elf interre&s;ted, and monopo|lizing clergy, who had no bounds to their u&s;ur|pations, and &s;corned to live under any rational controul.&mdash;All reforming efforts prove abortive, while the clergy rule the roa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030192_0012_0FE5099B57135D28">At length &s;ome di&s;appointed Monks, or out|voted Cardinals, fired with revenge again&s;t the &s;eer of Rome, publickly expo&s;ed the ab&s;urdities of current orthodoxy. They &s;et up a new traf|fic for them&s;elves: and as the &s;ucce&s;s of one impo&s;ture proves a &s;timulus to various others, we find the chri&s;tian religion divided, and &s;ub|divided, into a variety of branches. Per&s;eve|rance and artifice e&s;tabli&s;hed every &s;ect into a kind of licen&s;ed Order. All are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of divine grace; none are exempt from the pro|mi&s;es of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Kings chu&s;e &s;ome favourite &s;y&s;tem, as the religion of the land; not for their own good, but for that of their loving &s;ubjects. The pious clergy reforming with the times, found it their intere&s;t to crouch to the foot of monarchy; royal letters patent, by the Lord's annointed, &s;ealed their dogma's with a divine mi&s;&s;ion. Se|parate e&s;tabli&s;hments en&s;ued; one church vied with another, &s;ect accu&s;ed &s;ect of fal&s;e doctrine, here&s;y, and &s;chi&s;m: the Bible was re&s;orted to as the rallying point of all controver&s;ies: divines of all de&s;criptions trea&s;uring it up, as the grand ma|gazine, which heaven re&s;erves for their mutual purpo&s;es. Like a free port for all nations, the Bible harbours all, and &s;upplies the contending
<PB N="14" REF="030192_0013_0FE5099D50B16C18">
parties with the implements of war and contro|ver&s;y. This Bible will confute in one pa&s;&s;age the doctrine it approves in another. Tenets however doubtful can be proved by &s;cripture, and fancy. From hence orginated theological broils, and national calamities: with a variety of evils heaped on man, by the blind leaders in religious ceremonies, which we hope modern wi&s;dom has finally put an end to.</P>
<P>We have now no further need of holy wars to fight the Lord's battle, nor religious per&s;ecutions to e&s;tabli&s;h the word of God; fagots need not be lighted, nor racks, nor gibbets erected, to propa|gate a divine theology, which has nothing for its object, but &s;lavery to the laity, and revenue to the clergy.</P>
<P>Can a rational being &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that a religion de&s;cended from heaven, &s;hould &s;pread &s;uch terror and de&s;olation wherever it makes its appearance: or that a gracious God, would &s;peak to his peculiar people, in a language not to be under&s;tood: or tran&s;mit to po&s;terity, a hi&s;tory &s;o ob&s;cure and unintelligible, as to leave us in eternal doubts and uncertainties: a hi&s;tory no le&s;s difficult to reconcile in all its parts, than to bring the two polar &s;tars into one point: no|thing can be a more glaring contra&s;t, than the different con&s;tructions each &s;ect puts upon the
<PB N="15" REF="030192_0014_0FE5099F01E25C60">
words of the Bible. To believe what they all &s;ay, is impo&s;&s;ible, and how to di&s;criminate we know not. Shall we then renounce the fabric, with all its fiction, rap&s;odies and concomitant ab&s;urdi|ties: or &s;hall we &s;till keep growling in the dark and never find our way, &s;hall we nod approba|tion to a &s;y&s;tem of blind my&s;teries, and refu&s;e to embrace tho&s;e truths conveyed to us by the light of nature and of rea&s;on? we &s;ee the chri&s;|tian world convul&s;ed and agitated, and it only requires the virtuous exertions of enlightened men to re&s;tore tho&s;e captive &s;laves, under the bondage of Prie&s;ts, to the family of freemen.</P>
<P>The few remaining fanatics will not fail to brand us with their u&s;ual epithets of <HI>changlings, &s;hifted about by every wind of doctrine, a natural man, carnally minded,</HI> with other cant phra&s;es. But may we not with equal ju&s;tice retort, and accu&s;e them of &s;hifting their ground, changing from primitive in&s;titutions, and borrowing their maxims from the mo&s;t notorious errors. What are the whole chain of reformers, but the off|&s;pring of popery, the illegitimates of &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry? If fortunately for the good of man, we could di&s;&s;ipate the clouds that cover &s;o many my&s;teries, and remove the errors of human in|vention, we &s;hould be better able to confute the proud pre&s;umption of tho&s;e who threaten with
<PB N="16" REF="030192_0015_0FE509A1E5CCB648">
the vengeance of heaven, all who attempt to al|ter one tittle of their ritual. <Q>Liberty of thought &s;ays the philo&s;opher, is the fir&s;t of rights, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectable domain, is that of con&s;cience: the&s;e being the gifts of nature conferred on man," <HI>who &s;hall &s;ay we have not the right to examine.</HI></Q></P>
<P>May we not then under the hopes of impunity examine the precepts of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ee whether its boa&s;ted morality exce&s;s tho&s;e of other nations, &s;o much reprobated by Chri&s;|tians. We &s;hall</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the clergy of all na|tions, examine the holy order of tho&s;e mi&s;&s;iona|ries &s;ent by chri&s;tian kings, and Roman Pontiffs, to convert infidel nations to chri&s;tianity:</P>
<P>Secondly, we &s;hall notice the exemplary vir|tues of tho&s;e patriots who graced the golden age: the&s;e we &s;hall do by a reference to their re&s;pective hi&s;tories, after which we &s;hall pro|ceed,</P>
<P>Thirdly, to analize the venerable &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The&s;e three things being promi&s;ed, we pro|ceed, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to examine the conduct of the&s;e chri&s;|tian mi&s;&s;ionaries who have travelled into foreign countries to &s;pread the light of the go&s;pel. The&s;e, in&s;tead of convincing the natives, that they
<PB N="17" REF="030192_0016_0FE509A996796EE8">
excelled in the practice of moral virtues, have given the loo&s;e to every kind of vice, and out done in every &s;pecies of plunder and debauchery, tho&s;e who have lived without religion, and without laws. They had committed every enor|mity that could make human nature appear mon|&s;trous. Few can be ignorant of the cruelties committed by the Spani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries at Mexico and Peru, where they built churches at the ex|pence of the inhabitants, and endeavouring to explain the my&s;teries of their religion to the natives, in a language of which they were totally ignorant, and afterwards piou&s;ly &s;laughtered them as heretics, for not believing what had been &s;o clearly demon&s;trated to them. When the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries had conquered the I&s;land of Hi&s;pa|niola, they made peace with the natives upon conditions that they would cultivate all their lands for the u&s;e of the &s;ervants of Je&s;us, and al&s;o to furni&s;h them with a certain quantity of Gold every month. The poor wretches finding the ta&s;k un&s;upportable, as well as impo&s;&s;ible, took &s;helter in the mountains to &s;creen them|&s;elves from their cruel oppre&s;&s;ors, but the Spa|niards in ju&s;tice (as they &s;aid) to the injuries offered by the natives to God's people, trained their dogs to hunt them, and fired with &s;uper|&s;tition,
<PB N="18" REF="030192_0017_0FE509ACB068F990">
made a vow that each of them would de&s;troy twelve Indians every day, in honour of the twelve apo&s;tles; to this might be added a brilliant hi&s;tory of the plunders and ravages committed by our much re&s;pected mother coun|try, upon the plains of Hindo&s;tan, but, humanity recoils at the di&s;mal recital.</P>
<P>From a view of &s;uch &s;cenes of cruelties com|mitted under the banner of a meek and &s;uffer|ing God, and by the real profe&s;&s;ors of his holy religion, what inference can we draw, but that they look upon their religion to be a mere farce, and the Bible upon which it is founded, to be all a lie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am purpo&s;ely &s;hort in this fir&s;t propo&s;ition the &s;econd and third being rather lengthy.</NOTE></P>
<P>We now proceed to notice in the &s;econd place the exemplary virtues of our primitive patriots. Men are &s;o infatuated even to this day, that they affect to look back with a reverential awe, and devoutly honour the pa&s;t periods of the world, with the &s;plended title of the <HI>golden age,</HI> admiring what is pa&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;ing what is pre&s;ent, with the hardened epithet of the <HI>age of iron.</HI> They indeed affirm, without much authority, that in the patriarchial ages, the earth brought forth her abundance &s;pontaneou&s;ly, that
<PB N="19" REF="030192_0018_0FE509AFAC4AA750">
the Lion, and the Tyger were harmle&s;s as the Lamb, and that mankind free from tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, lived in the utmo&s;t &s;implicity and &s;e|curity: but if the Bible did not confute &s;uch accounts, I &s;hould not be able to do it, under the authority of that confu&s;ed and barbarous hi&s;tory, of which the following is a brief abridg|ment. In&s;tead of all virtue then exi&s;ting upon earth, the fate of the abandoned cities which were con&s;umed wirh fire, &s;aid to be from hea|ven, is a proof to the contrary, and gives us an example of the total corruption of ancient times. The diffidence that every man entertained of his neighbour, is no weak argument in fa|vour of their di&s;hone&s;ty. Abraham and I&s;aac both apprehended that they would be &s;lain for the &s;ake of their wives, and it was no uncom|mon thing for a man to require an oath of his neighbour that he would do him no harm.</P>
<P>The &s;tories of Judah and Tamer, his daugh|ter in law, and the rape of Dinah, gives us a ju&s;t idea of the debauchery and inju&s;tice of God's cho&s;en people&mdash;Judah condemned Ta|mer for the crime he had committed with her; &mdash;The perfidious &s;ons of Jacob &s;lew the Sheche|mites after they had ratified a treaty of peace with them, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner;&mdash; Jacob bargained with his uncle to &s;erve &s;even
<PB N="20" REF="030192_0019_0FE509B8458F7640">
years for his daughter Rachel: when the time expired, Laban &s;hamefully impo&s;ed upon him Leah, and had the effrontery to ju&s;tify what he had done, and exacted another &s;even years for Rachel;&mdash;Jacob deceived his brother E&s;au;&mdash; the &s;ons of Jacob &s;old their brother Jo&s;eph as a &s;lave to the Egyptians;&mdash;Mo&s;es committed murder; David contrived to have Uriah &s;lain, that he might enjoy his wife Rebecca;&mdash;Solomon committed boundle&s;s fornications;&mdash;and Ab&s;o|lon in the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s manner, cohabited with a multitude of women, before a numerous people.</P>
<P>Such, pious Chri&s;tians, are the accounts of the peculiar favourites of the <HI>Deity,</HI> recorded in the divine volume, &s;o much admired by ig|norance and credulity. But, when Chri&s;tianity took effect, were crimes le&s;s u&s;ual? Does hi&s;|tory paint mankind as meliorated at &s;o great an event? alas! the rever&s;e is the fact. Gloomy &s;uper&s;tition &s;tarted up accompanied with per|&s;ecution, which drenched the world in blood. Rome erected a &s;piritual authority, and indi&s;|criminately trampled on the rights of God and Man; Chri&s;tian Saints &s;ucceeded heathen Gods: witchcraft and miracles were oppo&s;ed to the e|ternal unerring laws of nature. On looking over a va&s;t de&s;ert of eighteen centuries, we find
<PB N="21" REF="030192_0020_0FE509B9D279A128">
that Chri&s;tianity has been the parent of ignor|ance, and the hand-maid of oppre&s;&s;ion, cru|elty and &s;uper&s;tition. Blind my&s;teries and fa|bulous tales, are the &s;piritual food dre&s;&s;ed up for the faithful in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When Rome, the proud mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uper&s;ti|tion, a&s;&s;umed a &s;piritual and temporal authority over all Europe, &s;he not only fettered men's minds to &s;lavi&s;h doctrines, but pre&s;umptuou&s;ly laid an embargo on heaven. No more angels &s;hall de&s;cend from thence to mini&s;ter unto men; no more prophets &s;hall predict the will of God; no more miracle to confound the ob&s;tinate, but &s;uch as are wrought by her own members; and tho&s;e, like the miracles of Je&s;us, are done in &s;ecret, and &s;een only by the credulous ignorant. Yet the&s;e imaginary phenomenons have been trumpeted a far off by the oracles of deceit, and were the grand in&s;truments in duping the Chri&s;|tian world into a &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uper&s;ti|tious formalities and idle ceremonies. When a few Chri&s;tian States reformed from the errors of popery, and &s;hook off the pope's &s;upremacy, the clergy piou&s;ly pre&s;erved to them&s;elves the means of power and monopoly. They changed indeed the name of their religion, but they firmly maintain the aggrandizing benefices. They are continually di&s;claiming again&s;t the damnable doc|trine
<PB N="22" REF="030192_0021_0FE509BB5B55F878">
of the Roman church, who in her turn accu&s;es them of here&s;y. Thus an irreconciliable difference pervades the whole ma&s;s of Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors. The Chri&s;tian &s;aints are con&s;idered as the tutular deities, who pre&s;ide over the churches dedicated to them. The Catholicks have a day which they con&s;ecrate to the memory of &s;even thou&s;and holy virgins, who &s;lept three years and thought it but one night. The En|gli&s;h have their St. George; the Scotch their St. Andrew; the Welch their St. Taffy; the Iri&s;h their St. Patrick, &amp;c. Churches are dedi|cated to the&s;e imaginary &s;aints, and days reli|giou&s;ly ob&s;erved to commemorate their virtues.</P>
<P>In this country we &s;mell too &s;trong of the old leaven, our churches are dedicated to we know not who, and though we profe&s;s to be the mo&s;t liberal in our religious principles, we have not one church in this great continent dedicated to the <HI>&s;upreme Being.</HI> Rea&s;on dictates, that when we enter a temple, con&s;ecrated to religious wor|&s;hip, it ought to be dedicated to the being there|in wor&s;hipped. The God of nature being the grand object of all rational adoration, every hou&s;e of wor&s;hip &s;hould be dedicated to him alone. But the great trait in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is its pre-eminence in the &s;cience of contradiction;
<PB N="23" REF="030192_0022_0FE509BE2B006858">
Chri&s;tians contemn <HI>a dei&s;t</HI> for unbelief, but they cannot accu&s;e him of idolatry.</P>
<P>A <HI>dei&s;t</HI> believes in <HI>a &s;upreme being</HI> without an equal, or a troop of infernal deities, called devils or damned &s;pirits. <HI>A dei&s;t</HI> contemplates the glory of omnipotence, in the minute&s;t of his works, and wor&s;hips God in every particle of his crea|tion; <HI>a dei&s;t</HI> pre&s;umes not to dictate to the al|mighty, what ble&s;&s;ings he &s;hall give, or what evils to withhold; <HI>a dei&s;t</HI> is convinced by rea&s;on and experience that human petitions will never alter the will of providence; <HI>a dei&s;t</HI> endeavours to make him&s;elf happy in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, con|temns no man for opinions; is liberal, candid, and communicative to all men. But a Chri&s;tian wor&s;hips three Gods in the per&s;on of one God: and in defiance to the &s;cience of numbers con|tends that, <HI>three times one is one,</HI> and that, <HI>once one is three;</HI> he petitions the <HI>deity</HI> in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and dictatorial manner; he is di&s;&s;atisfied with what he has, and is continually coveting more; contemns tho&s;e who differ from him in opinion, and is ready to per&s;ecute his brother to do his God a &s;ervice. In &s;hort, a Chri&s;tian, is illiberal, narrow minded, and uncharitable in the extreme. They tell us that their God is his own &s;on; that this &s;on is his own father, and that he was born unbegotten, being <HI>four thou|&s;and

years older than his mother.</HI> Three Gods are but one God; three eternals are but one eternal, three Almighties are but one Almighty; in &s;hort, almo&s;t every tenet in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, is a complete negative to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now contra&s;t a few pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ublime medley, called the Bible, by comparing its former with its latter parts, and &s;hewing the difference between the old and new word of God. In the former part we are informed that Elijah never ta&s;ted death, but that he was hoi&s;t|ed off alive to heaven in a chariot of fire; in the latter part we are informed that <HI>it is appoint|ed to all men once to die:</HI> and that <HI>fle&s;h and blood cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Whether Elijah was a man or a compo&s;ition of fle&s;h and blood, I leave the Chri&s;tian doctors to determine. Mo|&s;es tells us to re&s;i&s;t evil and &s;eek re&s;titution for injuries done unto us, even to &s;o nice a fraction, as <HI>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth &amp;c.</HI> But Chri&s;t in direct oppo&s;ition to him, tells us to <HI>re&s;i&s;t not evil,</HI> and if any one &s;hall &s;mite us on the one cheek, turn unto him the other al&s;o. As the&s;e two divine legi&s;lators differ &s;o materially in their preceptorial functions, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to adhere to them both: and tho&s;e pious Chri&s;tians who believe all the Bible to be the revealed will of God, mu&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="030192_0024_0FE509C92827DC88">
plainly &s;ee that in the&s;e oppo&s;ite precepts, God contradicts him&s;elf: which totally de&s;troys the idea of his being <HI>an unchangeable God, the &s;ame to day, to morrow, and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>How chimerical are tho&s;e notions which &s;up|po&s;e that an infinite God, in the per&s;on of man, or angel, &s;hould in his flight thro' immen&s;ity, perch upon this earth, and relate tho&s;e con|temptible &s;tories, about <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> and his <HI>foxes: Balaam</HI> and his <HI>a&s;s: Jonah</HI> and his <HI>whale: Bell</HI> and his <HI>dragons,</HI> or <HI>Tobit</HI> and his <HI>dog. Two is better than one, that which is crooked cannot be made &s;traight; that which is wanted can never be numbered:</HI> with a variety of &s;uch frivolities, as are too in&s;ignificant to amu&s;e the feeble ge|nius of a child. Such never can be the lan|guage of a God infinite in wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Fellow citizens, in&s;ult not the deity by at|tributing to him a work &s;o barbarou&s;ly written, as that book called the Bible. Let the follow|ing pa&s;&s;ages &s;erve as a &s;ample of the ba&s;e pro|duction. "<HI>Now go and &s;mite Amelak and utterly de&s;troy all that they have, and &s;pare them not: but &s;lay both man and woman, infant and &s;uck|ling, ox and &s;heep, camel and a&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> Again &mdash;<HI>Let his children be fatherle&s;s and his wife a wi|dow, let his children be continually vagabonds and

The only apology, for this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age, is, that it is the compo&s;ition of a royal prophet. As for the P&s;alms of <HI>David,</HI> the Songs of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of <HI>De|borah</HI> and <HI>Baruk,</HI> they were &s;ung in the camps of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> and in the <HI>cities</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as <HI>Homer's</HI> works were &s;ung in the <HI>cities</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Athens.</HI> Our Bible makers, however, took infinite pains to collect together tho&s;e &s;cattered remnants of oriental poetry, cal|ling them the word of God: and metamorpho&s;ed David into a pious Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>On clo&s;ely examining this holy Bible I find it to be the dregs of ancient folly and pre&s;ump|tion. Some parts of it pretend to give an hi&s;tory of the antediluvian and the fir&s;t ages of the pa&s;t diluvian world: other parts de&s;cribe God's deal|ings
<PB N="27" REF="030192_0026_0FE509CD304D72B0">
with man, under the Jewi&s;h oeconomy, where all nature is &s;aid to be inverted to con|vince tho&s;e blind people of their errors: yet it appears that God's government over them was ineffectual, and void of energy. The up|holder of worlds could not keep the&s;e people in proper &s;ubjection; he was therefore, accord|ing to this Bible, obliged to re&s;ign his command, and &s;uffer a people, for whom he had &s;o paren|tal an affection, to become the common vagrants of the earth. Other parts of this holy book predicts what God will do in time to come: but as no &s;pecific time is affixed to any particular event, our zealous partizans are making daily di&s;coveries of the fulfilments of the prophecies.</P>
<P>There is I think one pa&s;&s;age of the Bible which bids fair never to be accompli&s;hed, while a Chri&s;tian king is in exi&s;tence, and which might be truly verified, if tho&s;e devouring mon&s;ters were finally extirpated, viz. <HI>"they &s;hall turn their &s;words into plough &s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks."</HI> When <HI>Saul</HI> was a pea&s;ant, he enquired of a prophet con|cerning his fathers a&s;&s;es, but when he mounted a throne, his maje&s;ty con&s;ulted a <HI>witch</HI> on the &s;ucce&s;s of a battle; &s;uch is the univer&s;al piety of kings.</P>
<P>A wretch more infernal than either <HI>witch</HI> or

<HI>Devil,</HI> would be con&s;ulted by a king with avidi|ty, while in pur&s;uit of conque&s;t, fame, and ambition.</P>
<P>I now proceed to examine tho&s;e events called miracles, recorded in the &s;acred hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The famous miracle of the red &s;ea dividing, and affording a dry pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and his fol|lowers claims the fir&s;t rank. If the hi&s;tory of Egypt deceives me not, I find the &s;ame &s;ea afforded a &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> and his whole army, when they were pur&s;uing victory, to the de&s;truction of the Per&s;ian em|pire. We are as well a&s;&s;ured that the red &s;ea divides once a year in that particular &s;pot, as we are of the hurricanes in the We&s;t Indies, or the mon&s;oon in the Ea&s;t Indies. The &s;econd grand miracle, is that of the &s;un's &s;tanding &s;till at the command of <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> As this mighty miracle is fully confuted by the Newtonian &s;y&s;|tem of a&s;tronomy, I &s;hall pa&s;s it by without a &s;ingle comment. If then, the two greate&s;t mi|racles upon record are either accounted for, or confuted by the laws of nature, what credit ought to be given to tho&s;e little tricks played off in the dark by magicians and &s;ooth&s;ayers. That Mo&s;es was a crafty and arbitrary legi&s;lator appears evident from his own account. He took the advantage of thick hazy weather to go up
<PB N="29" REF="030192_0028_0FE509DB3505C2D0">
to the mountain, where he affected to con&s;ult the deity, and then returned with his head full of proclamations, &s;aying, <HI>"thus &s;aith the Lord."</HI> The deluded people, being duped, paid the mo&s;t religious regard to all his precepts which for the mo&s;t part were exceedingly &s;tupid.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps of all the high fini&s;hed villains that ever degraded the page of hi&s;tory, or the &s;hape of humane, none ever eqalled the mon&s;ter Mo&s;es in &s;cenes of &s;y&s;tematic plunder, murder, and de|bauchery. To a&s;&s;ert that &s;o vile a character could have acce&s;s to the deity, and con&s;ult him face to face, is to a&s;&s;ert that the deity is acce&s;&s;ary to his crimes, crimes &s;o complicated as to &s;tagger all rational belief; Nay, charity obliges me to hope they are not done.</NOTE> His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors pur&s;ued the &s;ame maxims. Nothing could pa&s;s into a law, until it was &s;anctioned by divine approbation: this once obtained, it was proclaimed with another, <HI>"Thus &s;aith the Lord."</HI> Who can ju&s;tify the bauld-headed prophet, in calling from the woods two &s;he bears to devour forty and two little children: or can we &s;uppo&s;e that the wi&s;e&s;t man that ever lived &s;hould be the chief of adulterers and fornicators: though at a period when incapable of further exce&s;&s;es,
<PB N="30" REF="030192_0029_0FE509DCC100BAA8">
he made a fortunate di&s;covery, <HI>"that all was vanity."</HI> But, pa&s;&s;ing over tho&s;e wi&s;e men, murderers and miracle makers, I &s;hall proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the New Te&s;ta|ment: and here I tru&s;t that every rational Chri&s;tian, who &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders this &s;ubject, will look back with horror upon his former folly, and reflect upon him&s;elf, for being &s;o long the dupe of faction, the &s;port of impo&s;|tures and the victim of deceit.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is prefaced with one of the mo&s;t extravagant fables ever recorded, a fable &s;o much dwelt upon as the &s;ource of all human mi&s;eries, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s it over without &s;ome animadver&s;ions. I allude to the wars in heaven, which, by the by, are only a prelude to the fall of man.</P>
<P>I know not the time, in which this rebellion is &s;aid to have happened, but the hi&s;tory of this memorable event is as follows: <HI>Satan,</HI> once the highe&s;t angel in heaven, and next in power to the Deity, &s;timulated by ambition, a&s;pired to the throne, and with a va&s;t number of his confederates con&s;pired again&s;t the &s;upreme power. The deity appri&s;ed of the evil imagi|nations of the in&s;urgents, who&s;e intentions were to dethrone him, immediately &s;ummoned a nu|merous army, at the head of which he placed
<PB N="31" REF="030192_0030_0FE509E0E2FB94E8">
<HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> then <HI>angel Gabriel,</HI> and conferred upon him the high office of commander in chief of the heavenly ho&s;t. The progre&s;s of the proud con&s;pirator was impeded, after a mo&s;t de&s;perate battle, in which the &s;uperior ge|neral&s;hip of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the valiant pow|ers of his royal army, proved victorious. Satan's troop of infernals, being &s;o completely routed, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to rally his forces, or take the field a &s;econd time. <HI>Genearl Je&s;us</HI> pur&s;ued his victory, and kept clo&s;e to the rear of <HI>Satan's</HI> retreating army, until he had finally driven the rebels beyond the boun|daries of heaven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here blind Milton takes his poetic flight, and &s;ets the heavens in an uproar; he pur&s;ues with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s the lofty &s;tile of genius, and humours with va&s;t &s;ublimity, the fabulous dreams of theological facts; O that &s;uch talents &s;hould be lo&s;t in fable.</NOTE></P>
<P>So wonderful was this war conducted that not one &s;oldier was killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oner on either &s;ide, during the whole cam|paign.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t further ob&s;erve that the conduct of the Deity was widely different from that of the pre&s;ent rulers of the world: who immediately
<PB N="32" REF="030192_0031_0FE509ECF0F98190">
execute tho&s;e that re&s;i&s;t their government. The Deity pur&s;ued a different plan; he added ano|ther limb to creation by forming a place called Hell; he put a crown upon the head of Satan, and gave him the &s;overeign dominion over that va&s;t empire, with full power and authority, to commit all manner of depredations upon the inhabitants of this earth, as if we had been a party concerned in the rebellion. The fir&s;t &s;hock we &s;u&s;tained, by this infernal Mon&s;ter, was at a time when he had taking a country airing in the garden of Eden, where he a&s;&s;umed the form of a &s;erpent, and by the charms of his eloquence, and the ratling of his tail, he prevailed on mother Eve to eat an apple, by which all mankind would have been eternally damned if the Deity had not ratified a treaty of amity and commerce between Satan and the clergy about 1796 years ago.</P>
<P>The conditions of this treaty, for inhumanity cruelty, and inju&s;tice, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all rational be|lief. The preamble is briefly this: a virgin was over&s;hadowed by the holy Gho&s;t: this ho|ly Gho&s;t was God: the virgin conceived, and brought forth a &s;on: this &s;on was God al&s;o. There is &s;omething very puzzling to make it appear, that Chri&s;t is the &s;econd per&s;on in the trinity. If the holy Gho&s;t over&s;hadowed the
<PB N="33" REF="030192_0032_0FE509EE814F4038">
virgin Mary and that &s;he conceived by him; then the fruits of that conception mu&s;t be the &s;on of the holy Gho&s;t: of cour&s;e he is the grand&s;on of God, the third per&s;on in the trinity, and not the &s;econd. But my bu&s;ine&s;s is not to prove doctrinal points, I &s;hall therefore leave the doctors of my&s;teries to manage this part of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After this God, or, &s;on of God, had lived for thirty years in the mo&s;t perfect poverty and wretchedne&s;s, he commenced the profe&s;&s;ion of an itinerant preacher; and, in con&s;equence of his &s;editious tenets, he was accu&s;ed before the chief judge, who &s;entenced him to death, which he accordingly &s;uffered. It is &s;aid that Chri&s;t predicted all this him&s;elf, and that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary he &s;hould die for the &s;ins of the world. Yet it is remarkable, that the people who ex|ecuted &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a work, &s;hould of all others be &s;o much reprobated by Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t was expiring upon the cro&s;s he &s;aid to one of his fellow &s;ufferers, <Q>this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.</Q> This was the la&s;t &s;peech of a poor unfortunate God. But the creed makers a&s;&s;ert that he de&s;cended into hell. Whether then to beleive Chri&s;t, or creed mongers, is at the option of the reader, for my part, I believe neither. After Chri&s;t was
<PB N="34" REF="030192_0033_0FE509F049A43B30">
taken down from the cro&s;s, he was packed up in a &s;tone &s;epulchre, and a centinel placed at the mouth of the cave to prevent the corps from being &s;tolen away. Chri&s;t however, found means, without breaking the &s;eal, or alarming the &s;entinel, to creep out of the &s;epulchre, and take a journey all the way to hell: and was &s;o expeditious, as to return in le&s;s than three days, and took his po&s;ition as before. Fortu|nately for the Chri&s;tians, but quite the rever&s;e for the Jews, the &s;entinal fell fa&s;t a&s;leep, and afforded a mo&s;t &s;pecial opportunity for an angel to de&s;cend from heaven,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this cele&s;tial me&s;&s;enger had not arrived ju&s;t at the nick of time, it is a thou&s;and to one: but he would have been &s;hot dead by the &s;entinal.</NOTE> who rolled the &s;tone from the mouth of the &s;epulchre, and let out Je&s;us, alive and well, &s;afe and &s;ound. After this, Je&s;us appeared to a few of his former di&s;ciples and gave them &s;ome directions concern|ing their future mini&s;try, when, lo! he took wings and flew up to heaven.</P>
<P>Thus ends the whim&s;ical hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's birth, death, and re&s;urrection: on which I &s;hall make a few remarks, by way of illu&s;tration. I have not knowledge enough in my&s;teries to know what Chri&s;t's bu&s;ine&s;s could be in hell,
<PB N="35" REF="030192_0034_0FE50A011866EED8">
unle&s;s it was to pay his court to the royal fami|ly, and, by his per&s;onal appearance, convince Prince Satan that the treaty was ratified on his part, by which we were purcha&s;ed of the Devil, who&s;e property we were previous to the cru|cifiction. A papi&s;t will inform us, the better to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of purgatory, that Chri&s;t did not de&s;cend into the hell of the damned, having no &s;in to an&s;wer for. A pro|te&s;tant will retort, that he did not de&s;cend into purgatory, becau&s;e, having no &s;in, he need not go there for purification: but mo&s;t Chri&s;tians agree, that he de&s;cended into hell to preach the go&s;pel to the damned, and this clenches the argument at once. I mu&s;t give it as my opinion that Chri&s;t's &s;tay was too &s;hort in hell to deliver many &s;ermons, and that if he was accu&s;tomed to preach from notes, as mo&s;t of our modern divines are, they were in danger of being &s;corched by the flames; or, perhaps the climate was too hot to agree with his con&s;titution, and this obliged him to make &s;o &s;peedy a return to the more temperate regions of A&s;ia. The vulgar are led to believe that hell is &s;omewhat below us, or in the bowels of the earth, which notion is chimerical, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to know what part of the creation this tremendous aby&s;s occupies. If we may judge from the ge&s;tures
<PB N="36" REF="030192_0035_0FE50A064EB797E8">
of divines, in their pulpit harangues, heaven appears to be above us and hell below us, for when they mention heaven they look up, and when they mention hell they look down, it is like looking up for the &s;un, and down for the moon.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t did really leave the &s;epulchre, and de&s;cend into hell, could he not with equal fa|cility, have ri&s;en from the dead, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an angel: and made a public ap|pearance before that tribunal which condemned him to death. If he predicted that he would ri&s;e the third day after his crucifixion, would not tho&s;e who pronounced his &s;entence have anxiou&s;ly awaited the fulfilment of &s;uch pre|dictions, or, if he actually did ri&s;e from the dead, &s;hould he not have made his re&s;urrection of equal publicity, as his crucifixion; this he &s;hould have done unle&s;s he was afraid of being crucified a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>If darkne&s;s ob&s;cured the air,&mdash;if the earth &s;hook with a convul&s;ive pang,&mdash;if the vale of the temple was rent at Chri&s;t's crucifiction, he &s;hould, at his re&s;urrection, have da&s;hed to atoms the &s;epulchre wherein he was laid,&mdash;the proud temple &s;hould have been &s;hattered into du&s;t.&mdash; The palace of Caiphus,&mdash;and the hall of Pilot, &s;hould vani&s;h like &s;moak, &mdash; and a thou&s;and
<PB N="37" REF="030192_0036_0FE509F380B8DC38">
phenomenons &s;hould have taken place, to con|vince the Jews, that the great Being, whom they crucified, was now ri&s;en from the dead, agreeable to his own prediction. But alas! Nothing like this had happened, every thing was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>In the name of common &s;en&s;e, what great and mighty works did Chri&s;t perform, what godlike acts, or monuments of fame did he leave behind to e&s;tabli&s;h his divinity? His greate&s;t miracles are equalled, if not exceeded in the Old Te&s;tament. We grant that he de&s;troyed a whole herd of &s;wine, and a troop of devils, at one &s;troke,&mdash;he cur&s;ed the barren fig-tree, &mdash;and made a triumphant entry into the city of Jeru&s;alem, mounted upon an a&s;s &s;aid to be &s;to|len; with a variety of other feats, which taken in the aggregate, make rather again&s;t than for his divinity.</P>
<P>Had Chri&s;t left any thing wonderful, for the world to behold, we would &s;u&s;pend all doubts re&s;pecting his mi&s;&s;ion. But doing &s;o little we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the whole &s;y&s;tem to be a fraud piou&s;ly contrived by a few early impo&s;tors. Had he cau&s;ed a fountain to &s;pring from the dry land and rai&s;ed its &s;ummit to the utmo&s;t ken of human &s;ight; had he cau&s;ed the

<P>Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>"Lo I am with you even unto the end of the world."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I read the new word of God, com|monly called the go&s;pel, and &s;ee how often Chri&s;t appears and di&s;appears. <HI>A little while and you &s;hall &s;ee me, and a little while and you &s;hall not &s;ee me,</HI> and the indefatigable Mary meeting him on all occa&s;ions, it reminds me of Harlequin and Columbine; and the con&s;picuous, part the devil acts in the farce, is characteri&s;tic of old Pantaleon in the Pantomime.</NOTE> If &s;o, why &s;uch di&s;traction among Chri&s;tians; or why not make another vi&s;ible appearance, and &s;et matters right; and not give the poor clergy &s;o much room to com|plain for want of faith; nor exclaim that Chri&s;|tianity is lo&s;ing ground, and that <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> is gain|ing hard upon them. Do they in&s;inuate that Satan has violated the treaty, or that he is more

powerful than the Almighty; &s;urely not. That there is a want of faith among Chri&s;tians is evident, el&s;e mountains would be rolled about like pebble &s;tones.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, under the mo&s;t favourable circum+&s;tance in which we can view the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;|tem, it has all the marks of fraud and impo&s;ition; its &s;ole ba&s;is is founded upon fable, and its rubric more irrational than the heathen wor|&s;hip.</P>
<P>After the&s;e bold declarations, me thinks, I hear &s;ome Chri&s;tian exclaim, what, are we to have but one God; Are we to have no Je&s;us Chri&s;t to redeem us; Are we to have no holy Gho&s;t to &s;anctify us; Are we to have no in|fernal Demons to inflict torments? Why this would be to unhinge the whole order of our &s;y&s;tem, and place at once the righteous and the ungodly upon an equal footing. Surely Sirs, little need be &s;aid to prove that one true God, is better than a thou&s;and fal&s;e ones: as for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he never redeemed you; neither has the holy Gho&s;t &s;anctified you; the&s;e are but the catch words of prie&s;t-craft. Men are as independent of the&s;e &s;tep ladders, by which to climb up to heaven, as they were ten thou&s;and years ago. If Je&s;us Chri&s;t has redeemed you, why terrify the vulgar with the fears of hell?
<PB N="40" REF="030192_0039_0FE50A11B95DE1F0">
(as for the learned of all nations they have no fear about it.) If the holy Gho&s;t has &s;anctified you, in what manner does the &s;anctification ap|pear? Are Chri&s;tians more honourable or ho|ne&s;t in their way of dealing? are they freer from debauchery and vices of every kind than other men? With &s;orrow I repeat it, the rever&s;e is the melancholy truth. A little Turk|i&s;h morality, annexed to the pure&s;t precepts of the Chri&s;tian go&s;pel, would con&s;titute a better religion than any now in vogue.</P>
<P>It requires a round faith indeed to credit the exi&s;tence of a mon&s;trous devil, or that there is &s;uch a place as hell, I di&s;believe both: yet I am far from the opinion that the righteous and the ungodly will be upon an equal footing; for the &s;ame God who re&s;erves to him&s;elf the power to reward virtue, will al&s;o puni&s;h vice, independent to agents, demy gods, or infernal demons. As for unhinging the whole order of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, that can never be effected while the duplicity of the clergy, and the blind credulity of the laity are proof again&s;t rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, for, truly, &s;uch is the &s;y&s;tem of piety pre&s;erved by Chri&s;tians, that if a man, con&s;cious of the duty he owes his maker, undertakes to vindicate the moral cha|racter of the deity, in oppo&s;ition to the corrupt

<P>The Bible on which the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is founded, exhibits doctrines repugnant to each other, and inculcates principles highly injurious to the moral happine&s;s of man, it delivers pre|cepts of doubtful meanings, and are therefore liable to be di&s;puted, neither do the trumpet|ors of the Bible's prai&s;e, think proper to be governed by it, but follow their own cour&s;e of life as heedle&s;s as if they had no &s;uch thing as a Bible to be governed by. This book is written in &s;uch figurative and ambiguous lan|guage, hyperboles, and metaphorical phra&s;es, that it appears only calculated to puzzle creed-makers, miracle men, and &s;oul-&s;aviours.</P>
<P>When the church of Rome had the Bible un|der lock and key clo&s;ely concealed from the peo|ple, mankind were anxious to know the contents of the &s;acred depo&s;it, but the moment it were divulged its frivolty appeared, and the more this book is read, the le&s;s it is regarded. I firm|ly believe that if this Bible could be generally
<PB N="42" REF="030192_0041_0FE50A1517A4EEC8">
read without prejudice, there would not be a Chri&s;tian in exi&s;tence fifty years hence; it lays down no &s;y&s;tem of religion whatever, but is equally calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h Athei&s;m as Chri&s;|tianity, and is but a wanton burle&s;que upon God and his providence.

<Q>Think not that I am come to bring peace upon earth,</Q> no, but to &s;et families and friends at variance: the true character of a Chri&s;tian then, is to live in a continual &s;tate of warfare. And behold one of the mo&s;t gracious kings in Europe, in ju&s;tice to his profe&s;&s;ion, proclaims to the world that he is called upon by his religion, to pro&s;ecute with vigour the mo&s;t infamous war, that ever degraded the page of hi&s;tory. If then the Chri&s;tian religion is of a cele&s;tial origin, as its profe&s;&s;ors proudly boa&s;t it to be, would it, or could it, po&s;&s;ibly admit of &s;o many enormities. In &s;hort, view it in every direction and it ap|pears a mon&s;ter in full perfection.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented to us as <HI>the Prince of peace,</HI> though he &s;ays him&s;elf, that <HI>he is not come to bring peace upon earth.</HI> O &s;ublime contradic|tion, peace in one hand, and war in the other, welcome mo&s;t noble prince to this world below.</P>
<P>It is not, I am per&s;uaded the &s;ublimity of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem that invites &s;o many to its com|munion, when children, our parents lead us to their re&s;pective churches, and train us up to their different ceremonies; but when we begin to think for our&s;elves, di&s;covering errors not ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, we renounce our fir&s;t rituals, and embrace another doctrine, in order, if po&s;|&s;ible to arrive at &s;ome rational certainty; in&s;tead,
<PB N="44" REF="030192_0043_0FE50A2089FF6708">
however, of improving here, we find other tenets equally di&s;gu&s;ting, from this we change perhaps to a third, where &s;imilar errors &s;till exi&s;t, at length, fatigued by making fruitle&s;s re&s;earches after rational and comprehen&s;ive doc|trines, we abjure our rea&s;on, and join the com|mon cry that <HI>"all is my&s;tery."</HI> This was ab&s;olutely the ca&s;e with me for near forty years, till finding with all my endeavours to &s;ift out &s;ome con&s;i&s;tent mode of wor&s;hip, I was only changing from one ab&s;urdity to another, at length I &s;olemnly renounced them all. Is it not the &s;ame with the people of this continent, as it is with tho&s;e of other countries, who take their religion by chance, not by choice.</P>
<P>If the grand Turk of Con&s;tantinople had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a colony in America, in&s;tead of the king of Britain, we &s;hould be all Mahometans, we &s;hould then &s;ay of Chri&s;tians, as the Chri&s;|tians now &s;ay of the Mahometans. The rea&s;on why a child is brought to the &s;ynagogue to be circumci&s;ed is becau&s;e his father was a Jew, and he becomes a Jew him&s;elf for the &s;ame rea&s;on that his father was a Jew before him.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e we were in a mere &s;tate of nature, de&s;titute of any religion what&s;oever; and that all the religious extant were laid before us to cho&s;e from among them one; it is a query which

we &s;hould prefer; probably that which appear|ed the mo&s;t rational.

<P>As for the Chri&s;tian religion I know not what it is; Chri&s;t never in&s;tituted any, he only taught a few &s;craps of moral philo&s;ophy; the whole hi&s;tory of his life, and doctrines might be compri&s;ed in a &s;ix penny pamphlet, who taught us then that this man was God? Did he ever &s;ay &s;o him&s;elf? No. Did any of his di&s;ciples &s;ay &s;o? certainly not. Chri&s;t has not left a &s;ingle paragraph on record by which we may know his real &s;entiments; he had no learning in con&s;equence of his poverty, of which he made great merit, and wi&s;hed none to follow him, but tho&s;e who are equally poor as him&s;elf. But we di&s;cover a &s;triking contra&s;t in the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of his doctrines. He was illeterate, they are learned; he was poor, they are rich; he was humble, they are arrogant. In &s;hort, he was de&s;titute, but they have abundance.</P>
<P>Having &s;tretched this &s;econd propo&s;ition to &s;ome length I now proceed in the third place to analize the venerable &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="46" REF="030192_0045_0FE50A24260A7AC8">
and here I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate three propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the Chri&s;tian religion is impracti|cable.</P>
<P>Second, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, and</P>
<P>Thirdly, that it is unnatural.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then; that the Chri&s;tian religion is im|practicable, appears from the following precepts, which enjoins us <HI>to pray without cea&s;ing, to &s;ell all and follow Chri&s;t, to cut off our hands and pull out our eyes, in ca&s;e they &s;hould offend us, to love our enemies; ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, and pray for them that per&s;ecute and de&s;pitefully u&s;e us, &amp;c.</HI> Great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e pre|cepts, but we are a&s;&s;ured from long experience, that our prayers are ineffectual, and perhaps the rea&s;on is be&s;t a&s;&s;igned by the apo&s;tle, who tells us, that <HI>we receive not, becau&s;e we a&s;k in vain:</HI> What then is the u&s;e of a&s;king? have we not innumerable in&s;tances that human petitions never altered the divine will? David was three days and nights in prayer for the recovery of his child; the an&s;wer was, <HI>thy child &s;hall die.</HI> Are not all the kings of Europe, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their clergy, almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly &s;upplicating the deity in the name of Je&s;us, for the &s;ucce&s;s of their re&s;pective armies. But the God of battle hears them not; neither is it po&s;&s;ible to pray without
<PB N="47" REF="030192_0046_0FE50A27D119AB98">
cea&s;ing, becau&s;e the time required to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life, is about two thirds, and the remaining time is &s;carce &s;ufficient for re&s;t and refre&s;hment; therefore to &s;uppo&s;e a man can be in prayer continually, is to &s;uppo&s;e an impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>"To &s;ell all and follow Chri&s;t, is a precept delivered to the laity only, it does not effect the clergy, as appears by their love of riches, and in general this doctrine has had a contrary tendency, for the more pious and religious the Chri&s;tian, the more greedy after gain; point out to me a devout Chri&s;tian, and I will point out to you in the &s;ame per&s;on, a mi&s;erable world|ly muck-worm.</P>
<P>"To cut off our hands, or pull out our eyes," may be a kind of hyperbole, or figurative &s;peech, it is therefore the province of &s;ome learned doc|tor of divinity to explain how far the&s;e precepts can be compiled with.</P>
<P><Q>To love our enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us and pray for them that per&s;ecute and de&s;|pitefully u&s;e us,</Q> are precepts that look well on paper, though it is not the weake&s;t part of Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy that can &s;trengthen our re&s;olution, or re&s;train our re&s;entment of inju|ries done unto us; nor is it common among Chri&s;tians to kneel down and pray for the being
<PB N="48" REF="030192_0047_0FE50A30CC7164F0">
who is at the &s;ame moment cur&s;ing them. "To love our enemies," is a precept &s;trongly urged by the pleaders of the pulpit, but the pleaders of the bar preach a different doctrine; and if the greater number of adherants amounts to a proof in favour of any precept, we mu&s;t evi|dently declare for the latter; con&s;equently the preachers of the bar not tho&s;e of the pulpit, are in&s;pired by the holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the Chri&s;tian religion is in|con&s;i&s;tent to rea&s;on, will appear by the follow|ing. <HI>"If a man &s;mite you on one cheek turn unto him the other: he who &s;teals your coat, give him your cloak al&s;o: take no thought of to-morrow, neither &s;eek what ye &s;hall eat, drink, or wherewith ye &s;hall be cloathed."</HI> All the&s;e precepts are truly Chri&s;tian, and how far they can be com|piled with, common experience plainly demon|&s;trates. That they are incon&s;i&s;tent with moral happine&s;s, is beyond all doubt. As for encou|raging a thief, or tamely &s;ubmitting to a&s;&s;ault and battery, as applied by the two fir&s;t articles, it is contrary to the principles of moral ju&s;tice, or public order. The law of retaliation, as thought by Mo&s;es, is far more rational, and, I need not &s;ay, more univer&s;al. He who takes no "thought for to-morrow, nor &s;eeks what he &s;hall eat, drink, or wherewith he &s;hall be cloth|ed,"
<PB N="49" REF="030192_0048_0FE50A326BC68EE8">
would be con&s;idered as an idle vagabond; he would be de&s;titute of credit or re&s;pect; he would be covered with rags and poverty, and di&s;carded from all &s;ociety. Nay, where is the Chri&s;tian, be he ever &s;o pious, that is not anx|ious to day, for the bread he hopes to con&s;ume to-morrow. Even the clergy, the mo&s;t righte|ous of all men, are particularly nice in their table furniture; re&s;embling the rich man talked of in the go&s;pel, <HI>"They are cloathed in purple and fine linen, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed thirdly, to &s;hew that the Chri&s;tian religion is unnatural. "<HI>When thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call not thy friends, nor thy bre|thren, nor thy kin&s;man, nor thy rich neighbours</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But when thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the halt, and the blind. Except ye eat the fle&s;h of the &s;on of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Except ye are born again, and become as little children, ye can never enter the kingdom of heaven</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are the expre&s;s words of Chri&s;t, con&s;e|quently they are po&s;itive rules, proper to be obeyed by every profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e precepts denies a Chri&s;tian the &s;ocial enjoyment, which naturally re&s;ults from friendly vi&s;its, and rational entertainments;
<PB N="50" REF="030192_0049_0FE50A33F5665960">
it confines a Chri&s;tian to the company of poor, lame, and blind beggars. This precept is &s;o unnatural, that tho&s;e who have voluntarily cho|&s;en Chri&s;t for their head, never obey it. Even tho&s;e who pretend to have obtained patents from heaven, for being u&s;hers in Chri&s;t's &s;chool, pay no regard to it, but run through life with as little remor&s;e, or &s;hame at a breach of it, as the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate unbelievers. Can we &s;uppo&s;e that a right reverend father in God, by divine provi|dence, a true di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hould pro|vide a &s;umptuous entertainment, and &s;it down to glut and gormandize with his rich neighbours, to the total exclu&s;ion of the poor, the lame, the maim|ed, the halt, and the blind, when con&s;cious that he is thereby violating an expre&s;s command of his lord and ma&s;ter. Or &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e right reverends are concealed infidels who believe nothing of the matter? The words of Chri&s;t are plain and expre&s;s, they are not in a lofty &s;tile of language, neither are they hyperboles, or figurative &s;peeches, that mean more than is expre&s;&s;ed; they are plain words that do not admit of double deal|ing. If then the&s;e rules of life, laid down by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, are improper, as well as unnatural, and profe&s;&s;ors indulge them&s;elves in a total neglect of them, is it not the duty then of our fir&s;t rate divines to unfold this riddle?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="030192_0050_0FE50A359FE85D90">"Except ye eat the fle&s;h of the &s;on of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." It is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate the volumes of contraver|&s;y this text has given ri&s;e to, the contentions it has created, or the tuns of human blood it has &s;hed. To &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t offered his di&s;ciples real human fle&s;h to eat, and natural human blood to drink, is in it&s;elf &s;o barbarous and inhuman as to &s;hock our gro&s;&s;e&s;t feelings. This is one of the chri&s;tian my&s;teries never to be under&s;tood, and becau&s;e of its &s;ublimity it is con&s;trued into a &s;acra|ment, wherein bread is, by the conjuration of a prie&s;t, <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiated</HI> into fle&s;h, and wine <HI>eu|cra&s;ti&s;ed</HI> into blood, and this bread and wine is taken and received by the faithful "as the real body and blood of Chri&s;t." Thus a &s;y&s;tem of ca|nabali&s;m &s;piritualized, is the mo&s;t fundamental tenet in the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>"Except ye are born again, and become as little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven." If by being born again, &s;ignifies changing from one rule of faith to another, there are few Chri&s;|tians who have not been born and reborn over and over again. Whether Chri&s;t means this kind of re-generation, I know not, it is however unna|tural in the extreme, to &s;uppo&s;e we can grow downwards, &s;hrink into children, become as lit|tle infants, re-enter our mother's womb, and put
<PB N="52" REF="030192_0051_0FE50A4105BBD5A0">
her to the painful operation of giving us a &s;econd birth. This is &s;o repugnant to the cour&s;e of na|ture, and &s;o great an in&s;ult to rea&s;on, that I &s;hould think it a wa&s;te of time and paper to &s;ay more up|on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>There are a variety of other pa&s;&s;ages equally im|practicable, incon&s;i&s;tent, and unnatural as tho&s;e already quoted, but it would require a book as large as the Bible, to do them ju&s;tice. I &s;hall there|fore wave all further animadver&s;ion, and proceed to &s;ome cur&s;ary ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>There are a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, commonly called Quakers, who profe&s;s the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervance to the chri&s;tian precepts, particularly the&s;e; <HI>re&s;i&s;t not evil, &s;wear not at all, let your charity be in &s;ecret, place no dependance in long prayer, &amp;c.</HI>" but &s;urely he who pre&s;cribed the&s;e rules al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>"lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ure upon earth."</HI> The friends probably think they may &s;afely indulge them&s;elves in the breach of this latter precept, upon condition that they attend to the former rules. Chri&s;t, if I mi&s;take not, cautions his di&s;ciples, again&s;t making an outward &s;how of their profe&s;&s;ion, by any ex|ternal form, or dre&s;s, yet the moment we behold a man in a drab coloured coat, or an horizontal hat, we immediately think of a Quaker.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Paine a&s;&s;erts that the&s;e people are <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> but I hope he will excu&s;e me, when I &s;ay that this is paying them too high a compliment, they are be|tween the <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> which denote noth|ing but a Buckram pride, as rediculous, as it is &s;in|gular.</NOTE> The

<P>After the mon&s;trous heap of ab&s;urdities, thus briefly &s;tated, it is to be hoped that, in future, Chri&s;tians will not take the liberty to contemn Dei&s;ts, in the manner they have u&s;ually done.</P>
<P>Were I di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;pute doctrinal points, my e&s;&s;ay would be extended to an enormous &s;ize in|deed, yet I would wi&s;h to know what benefit ari&s;es from the frivolous ceremony of infant bap|ti&s;m, or &s;aying a few prayers over a dead per&s;on? For my part, I know of none, except good eating and drinking, in the former, and the par&s;on's fees in the latter, be con&s;idered as &s;uch. If &s;prinkling a little water upon the face of an infant, or &s;ay|ing a few prayers over a corps, could operate by way of a charm, the&s;e ceremonies would be of

infinite utility; but as they appear to be founded in prie&s;t-craft, no good can be expected to re&s;ult from them.</P>

<P>Divines, you call the&s;e enormities, only an abu&s;e of power, flowing from the corruption of Chri&s;tianity; but it is not your bountiful &s;tock of divine grace, nor all your rhetoric, nor pulpit admonitions, that can prevent the evils, nor wipe away the odium: know you not, that you are the time &s;ervers of every nation: the engines of de&s;poti&s;m: the tools of &s;tate&s;men, and of &s;o|vereigns: even to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate where occa&s;ion requires, whatever is the will of your prince, you chearfully obey, and thus you piou&s;ly &s;erve God and Mammon. You profe&s;s a dependance upon the mercies of your God, a reliance upon his providence, and a chearful re&s;ignation to his will; but the moment an epidemic appears you abandon all your profe&s;&s;ions, de&s;ert your church, and mi&s;tru&s;t the goodne&s;s of your God, who&s;e mercy and providence is no longer to be depended upon. I had an opportunity of making the&s;e ob&s;ervations in the ca&s;e of the Philadelphi|ans in the year 1793, and of the New-Yorkers in 1795, when the mo&s;t religious were the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive of danger, and the fir&s;t who fled from the contagion. Family attachment had no

check upon their fears, humanity yielded to &s;elf|i&s;h brutality, they no longer tru&s;ted to the mer|cies of a divine providence, and the God of Chri&s;tians was no longer the God of hope, at that awful cri&s;is. Chri&s;tian piety di&s;covered that the rural Gods were more propitious than the great ruler of populous cities.</P>
<P>Let us now li&s;ten to the language of your di|vine ma&s;ter, <HI>"what&s;oever ye a&s;k the father in my name, he will give it."</HI> Needs there any more to confute this vague a&s;&s;ertion, than a reference to long experience, and well known di&s;appointments. It is fre&s;h in the recollection of every man, that all churches and chapels of every &s;ect through the Briti&s;h dominions, were for &s;even &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years importuning the Almighty, to turn the hearts of the <HI>rebellious &s;ubjects in America.</HI> Why where not their prayers immediately an&s;wered, after heaven and earth were &s;o piou&s;ly moved to that effect, or why are not all Chri&s;tian petitions complied with, after being echoed from one nation to another, e&s;pecially &s;ince they are fer|vently offered up in the name, and for the &s;ake of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Lord and Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>He again tells us that, <HI>"his yoke is ea&s;y, and his burthen is light,"</HI> and invites "tho&s;e who are <HI>weary and heavy laden to come unto him, and he

will give them re&s;t.</HI>" Now, though it is the lan|guage of an humble God, to his poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples, I challenge the a&s;&s;ertions. His yoke, if &s;uch may be con&s;idered the obligation of per|forming his precepts, is &s;lavi&s;h beyond compa|ri&s;on, impo&s;&s;ible to be complied with, being repugnant to human nature, and his burthen, if &s;uch may be con&s;idered the expence of &s;up|porting his religion, is arbitrary, oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical, e&s;pecially in countries, where e&s;ta|bli&s;hed churches, have the exclu&s;ive right to expound the word of God, and where every individual is obliged to contribute to the religion which is mo&s;t fa&s;hionable at court; in &s;uch coun|tries, the clergy re&s;emble the imps of infernal deities, rather than the meek di&s;ciples of an <HI>humble, penitent, and &s;uffering Saviour.</HI> What re&s;t can the weary and heavy laden find, by &s;ub&s;cribing to a religion, bearing no proportion to it&s;elf, &mdash;a religion that confounds both &s;en&s;e and nature, and petrifies all human under&s;tanding,&mdash;a religion that humbles a God to a man, and proudly exalts man to a God,&mdash;a religion that makes the crea|ture a creator, and the creator a mere creature.</P>
<P>Is it to promote the knowledge of &s;uch a &s;y&s;|tem that &s;ocieties are formed. Yes, you will &s;ay, it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a &s;y&s;tem of religion. Granted; but is it nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a &s;y&s;tem

What benefit ari&s;es to man by con|founding <HI>divinity</HI> with <HI>humanity,</HI> or wor&s;hipping a feeble man, who di&s;claimed the title of a God. Are you afraid to offend the <HI>deity;</HI> by di&s;continu|ing to honour him.

<P>Strange indeed that a man who had all power in heaven and upon earth, the &s;aviour of a whole world, could not &s;ave him&s;elf, and prolong a ter|re&s;trial exi&s;tence, to the more &s;olid &s;atisfaction of future generations.

That the all powerful God of nature could perform more in eighteen &s;econds, than Chri&s;t had done during his earthly re&s;idence, all rea&s;on|able men will allow, yet this man is repre&s;ented to us as a <HI>God of wor&s;hip and adoration,</HI> and though he was mi&s;erably wretched, we are taught to believe he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>all power in heaven and upon earth.</HI></P>
<P>Were not his di&s;tre&s;&s;es in&s;upportable; did he not labour for a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence like many others; was he not as de&s;titute as the itinerant mendicant:&mdash;and did he not &s;uffer a degrading and ignominious death: but, you will &s;ay, all this was to &s;et an example to the world, and his death was to ran&s;om &s;inners from the wrath to come. Yes, he &s;et an example which his mo&s;t pious and zealous admirers &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid, and his death was evidently, becau&s;e he could not help it.&mdash;He preached up &s;edition, and oppo&s;ed the law of Mo&s;es, he in&s;ulted the Jewi&s;h Rabies, and ob&s;tructed their tranquility, for which they accu&s;ed him, and by legal pro&s;ecution &s;entenced him to death agreeable to the cu&s;toms of their country.

<P>Upon a clear examination, I find this &s;aviour of the world is but a partial redeemer, his atoning merits extending but to a few of the human race. The number of people inhabiting Chri&s;tian na|tions, does not exceed 136 millions; one fourth of them are <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> con&s;equently they di&s;claim all participation in the meritorious &s;ufferings of a &s;aviour.

The whole globe has about 400 millions of inhabitants, &s;ubtract 102 millions of Chri&s;|tians, and there remains 366 millions of people; who know not Chri&s;t, nor chu&s;e him for their head; mu&s;t all the&s;e peri&s;h eternally, mu&s;t they linger in never ending torments, and wallow for|ever in fire,&mdash;brim&s;tone,&mdash;melted lead,&mdash;brandy and gun-powder,&mdash;with all the combu&s;tibles a vicious prie&s;thood can invent, becau&s;e they do not believe what is not true.

<P>The mo&s;t potent evidence in favour of the Chri&s;tian &s;cheme, are tho&s;e of Mary and Thomas, though it is a little remarkable that Thomas &s;aid
<PB N="80" REF="030192_0078_0FE50AC780F792E8">
nothing about the matter him&s;elf; other people tell the &s;tory for him. As for Mary, &s;he gains greater credit, than would be given to a lady of more honour and veracity in tho&s;e days: it is rather &s;trange, that Mary and Thomas never fa|voured the world with either an epi&s;tle or a go&s;|pel upon the &s;ubject. They, it &s;eems, told the &s;tory to others; others told it again to others, till at length the tradition, like that which Mo|&s;es gives us of the creation, becomes the prevail|ing belief. Were an old Methodi&s;t woman to a&s;&s;ert that &s;he &s;aw John We&s;tly, a certain time after his burial, that he was &s;een by many others of his mo&s;t intimate friends, that he wrought many miracles before them, and then went up to heaven, would any one believe her; if &s;he had gone before a magi&s;trate and taken her oath that it was a fact; would &s;he gain the more credit, cer|tainly not: neither do I cho&s;e to believe Mary, nor Thomas, nor . . . . .</P>
<P>The primitive councils, who fir&s;t founded the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, took infinite pains to blend the virgin Mary with the God-head, and &s;o make it con&s;i&s;t of four per&s;ons in&s;tead of three; &s;he was however, rejected by a &s;mall majority. Notwith|&s;tanding &s;he lo&s;t her election, there are a nume|rous &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, who, to this day honour

All this proves to a demon&s;tration, that the world is governed by fraud, and not in|fluenced by rea&s;on. The four following remarks will bring us to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Lords prayer is confe&s;&s;ed by all Chri&s;|tians to be of divine &s;ublimity, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any thing of human compo&s;ition, but this is far below the te&s;t of critici&s;m. In the former part you direct the Deity to do his own will, the next &s;entence demands bread for the day, what mo&s;t people are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Then proceeds a reque&s;t, that your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es might be forgiven, as you for|give tho&s;e who tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t you: But I &s;ay unto all Chri&s;tians, woe be unto them, if heaven &s;hews no more benignity on them, than they &s;hew mercy on their offenders.</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>If Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;poke by divine authority, it is blowing hot and cold with the &s;ame breath, every propo&s;ition of one being palpably contradicted by the other; however, the laws of Mo&s;es, take the lead of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's who&s;e pre|cepts

Whether then, your Chri&s;tian religion is of divine revela|tion or a trick played off in the dark ages of igno|rance, it is an untoward &s;y&s;tem, and de&s;erves to be admired only for its deformity.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The Chri&s;tian religion was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the terror of authority: the in&s;inuating arts of mi&s;&s;ionaries, per&s;ecution and pro&s;cription, &amp;c.
