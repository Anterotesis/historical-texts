<P>_THE corruption and folly of man appears not more remarkable in any thing, than in preferring the empty enjoyments of this world, to glory, honour and immorta|lity in the world to come. The mo&s;t careful diligence and pains are thought well be&s;towed, in making provi&s;ion for the &s;up|port and delight of the body; but in the con|cerns of our eternal peace, the colde&s;t wi&s;hes and feeble&s;t endeavours commonly &s;uffice; notwith&s;tanding our future intere&s;ts are as much more important than our pre&s;ent, as the hea|vens are higher than the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010643_0003_0F81BDA8C8FDE528">AND becau&s;e this is a very common as well as dangerous error, we find many reproofs and cautions pointed again&s;t it in the word of God; but in no part of the&s;e &s;acred writings more, than in the di&s;cour&s;es of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who came into the world to redeem us from our iniquities, deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world, and teach us the words of eternal life.&mdash;He it is who &s;peaketh in the words which have now been read, which, whether we con&s;ider the authority with which they are enforced, or the importance of the in&s;truction therein contained, de&s;erve our &s;erious and particular attention.</P>
<P>THAT we may under&s;tand the true meaning and purport of our text, &s;o as to receive that in&s;truction which it is de&s;igned, and adapted to convey to us, it is proper that we take notice,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, to whom the&s;e words were addre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;And our context informs us, that the&s;e were Jews, who followed Chri&s;t in multi|tudes with great profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect; but their notions of his character were quite wrong, and their views or expectations mean and un|worthy. They were no true believers in him, but were influenced in their whole conduct to|wards him by carnal motives. In this view Chri&s;t regards them, in this character he ad|dre&s;&s;es them in our text. The primary inten|tion of the&s;e words, we are &s;ure then, was not to in&s;truct his di&s;ciples, but the carnal Jews, who followed him for the loaves. This appears from the ver&s;e immediately foregoing; where|in our Lord, like a faithful teacher, who &s;ought
<PB N="5" REF="010643_0004_0F81BDA98CD7EEF0">
to be &s;erviceable to them in their be&s;t intere&s;ts, rather than ingratiate him&s;elf with them by po|pular artifices, charges their hypocri&s;y upon them freely and plainly&mdash;"Ye &s;eek me not," &s;ays he, <Q>becau&s;e ye &s;aw the miracles, but be|cau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</Q> Ver. 26. q. d &mdash;Though you pretend to honour me as a teacher come from God, becau&s;e you have &s;een the miracles I have wrought before you, yet I know this is not the true &s;pring of your zeal to find me, and re&s;ort to me; but it is becau&s;e you have been fed with my provi&s;i|ons, without any co&s;t or expence of yours. Your view is not to be in&s;tructed by me, but that you may again eat your fill of bread.</P>
<P>WE may note in the &s;econd place, the &s;ub|&s;tance and matter of the in&s;truction, which our Lord here gives them. He pre&s;cribes duty, expre&s;&s;ed both negatively and po&s;itively&mdash;<HI>La|bour not for the meat that peri&s;heth, but for that which endureth to everla&s;ting life.</HI> The phra&s;e implies a &s;erious concern, and diligent endea|vour, as has been remarked by critics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leigh's critica &s;acra.</NOTE> It de|notes an active exertment of our&s;elves, in order to obtain the end, or good propo&s;ed. The de|&s;ign of this command, is not only to declare to the Jews, to whom it was given, what was their duty, but al&s;o to encourage and per&s;uade them to a practical attendance thereunto. There is an en|couraging motive or inducement couched in the command, and plainly intimated in the manner in which it was delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010643_0005_0F81BDAA576BBE28">IT will be proper to remark once more, the object of tho&s;e endeavours here enjoyned, or what it was that the per&s;ons addre&s;&s;ed in the text were required to labour for&mdash;<HI>Not for the meat that peri&s;heth.</HI> There is a Hebrai&s;m in this phra&s;e. The negative particle is to be un|der&s;tood not ab&s;olutely, but comparatively.&mdash;The &s;en&s;e is, <HI>Labour not SO MUCH BY FAR for the meat that peri&s;heth.</HI> Meat here is to be taken by a Synecdoche, for all kind of provi&s;i|ons, for the &s;upport, and refre&s;hment of the body. The&s;e things &s;hould not be &s;ought after, in compari&s;on with the <HI>meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life.</HI> What is intended by this me|taphorical expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life,</HI> we may learn from the following context, ver. 32. and onward. <Q>Mo&s;es gave you not that bread from heaven, but my fa|ther giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. I am the bread of life: He that cometh unto me &s;hall never hunger, and he that believeth on me &s;hall never thir&s;t.</Q> The meaning of which is, that the doctrine concerning Chri&s;t, received by faith, is thro' the influence of the Holy Spirit, the &s;upport of the divine life; the &s;piritual food, whereby our &s;ouls are nouri&s;hed unto life eternal. The immediate object of faith is Chri&s;t, as exhibited in the divine te&s;ti|mony concerning him. In receiving this doct|rine into our hearts we receive Chri&s;t, and as it were feed upon him, to our &s;piritual nou|ri&s;hment; or as it is expre&s;&s;ed in ver. 53. we
<PB N="7" REF="010643_0006_0F81BDAE375D9580">
eat his fle&s;h, and drink his blood: That is, we fea&s;t our &s;ouls with the doctrine of his atone|ment. That this is the true meaning of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, appears from ver. 35. where after a&s;&s;erting that he was the bread of life, he quits the metaphor he had been pur&s;uing, and &s;ays, "he that cometh unto me &s;hall never hunger, and he that believeth on me &s;hall never thir&s;t." Believing on Chri&s;t, and coming to him, and eating the bread of life, are expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame import, mutually illu&s;trating each other. The plain &s;en&s;e of which is, receiving him as propo&s;ed to us, in the go&s;pel-doctrine concern|ing him. This &s;piritual food then, which our text exhorts to labour for, is Chri&s;t with his benefits, exhibited in the go&s;pel as the object of faith, or, which comes to the &s;ame thing, it is the divine te&s;timony, admitted into the mind and heart, or it is faith objectively con&s;idered. To labour for this meat then, is to labour that the &s;aving truth concerning Chri&s;t, may have acce&s;s to the heart; or, in other words, to la|bour for that faith by which the ju&s;t live, and which is, as it were, the food of their &s;ouls; that faith whereby the divine life is ingenerated, and whereby it is &s;upported. For this bread of life not only pre&s;erves, but gives life to the world. Tis the &s;ame thing that Peter calls the incorruptible &s;eed of the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever, whereby, when re|ceived into the heart by faith, we are born again. It may be added, that as man's natural life &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts not by bread alone, but by God's word of ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o the benedictive influence of the
<PB N="8" REF="010643_0007_0F81BDAF7AB44260">
Holy Spirit mu&s;t accompany the bread of life, that our &s;ouls may be in health and thrive and pro&s;per.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of our text then may be given in the following paraphra&s;e, q. d. <Q>This meat for which you take &s;o much pains will peri&s;h, as well as the life that is &s;upported by it: It ought not therefore to be the chief object or end of your cares and labours. Spend not your thoughts and &s;trength for the empty &s;hort-liv'd enjoyments of this world, which will never &s;atisfy, and &s;oon will fail you. But as you have an eternal intere&s;t at &s;take, let that be minded in &s;ome proportion to its im|portance. Let it be your principal concern and endeavour, to obtain that &s;piritual under|&s;tanding and belief of the truth, which I have declared unto you (wherein I the bread of life have been exhibited, as the object of faith) and tho&s;e influences of the Holy Spirit in and with the &s;ame, by which that divine life may be ingenerated, and &s;upported, which faileth not, but endureth forever.</Q></P>
<P>THE text thus opened will naturally &s;ugge&s;t to us the&s;e two doctrinal truths, viz.</P>
<P>FIRST. That the &s;oul is to be preferred to the body, or the intere&s;ts of the world to come, are va&s;tly more important than all the intere&s;ts and enjoyments of this life.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. That it ought to be the chief concern and endeavour of tho&s;e who hear the
<PB N="9" REF="010643_0008_0F81BDAF88B8E900">
call of the go&s;pel, to &s;ecure their eternal inte|re&s;t, and in order thereunto, obtain that faith in Chri&s;t, and that grace or influence of the Holy Spirit, which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e points, tho' it might pro|fitably be enlarged upon, I &s;hall wholly pa&s;s o|ver; as I think it mu&s;t be readily owned by all, who have any &s;erious regard for the plaine&s;t dictates of rea&s;on or &s;cripture.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They who would &s;ee this con&s;idered at large may read what Dr. Evans has written on this text, in his very u&s;eful di&s;cour&s;es on the Chri&s;tian Temper.</NOTE> The &s;econd will al&s;o, I think, be allowed, at lea&s;t as to the &s;ub&s;tance of it, &s;o far as it re&s;pects true believers. But whether the go&s;pel has any commands or encouragements, for &s;inners to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life, previous to regeneration, and &s;aving faith, is a point in which profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians have not been &s;o uni|ver&s;ally agreed. And they who have profe&s;&s;ed an agreement in the &s;imple affirmation of it, have yet differed con&s;iderably in their manner of explaining and defending it. I have there|fore thought, that it might be of good u&s;e, for the direction and &s;atisfaction of &s;erious minds, that this matter be carefully enquired into, and the &s;criptures diligently &s;earched upon it. And this is what I have propo&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, to attend unto, in this and &s;ome following di&s;cour&s;es. I shall therefore endeavour to ex|plain and confirm this propo&s;ition, which I think appears plainly to be implied in, and grounded upon our text; viz. That the hearers of the
<PB N="10" REF="010643_0009_0F81BDB0672A3308">
go&s;pel, antecedent to their believing in Chri&s;t &s;avingly, are commanded and encouraged, to make it their chief concern and endeavour, to obtain that faith and grace of the Holy Spirit, which is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tification, and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>IT would not be foreign to my text, to en|quire what is the nature of &s;aving faith, con&s;i|dered objectively, as the meat it&s;elf which gives and &s;upports that life of which believers are par|taker; and &s;ubjectively, as it denotes our re|ception of this &s;piritual food; as al&s;o how faith under both the&s;e con&s;iderations is the means of our obtaining and enjoying life, judicially, in our ju&s;tification, and adoption; &s;piritually, in regeneration and &s;anctification: But it is not my de&s;ign, at pre&s;ent, to pro&s;ecute the &s;ubject in this extent.&mdash;What I propo&s;e is to con&s;ider the obligation, and encouragement of the un|converted, to labour, or u&s;e endeavours, to ob|tain &s;alvation; and in order thereunto, to &s;eek for converting grace, and &s;aving faith.&mdash;And the method in which, I &s;hall pro&s;ecute this de&s;ign, is as follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. I WOULD &s;hew what tho&s;e endeavours are,
which are here intended.</P>
<P N="2">II. ENQUIRE whether men, without regene|rating grace and &s;aving faith, have any power or capacity for &s;uch endeavours.</P>
<P N="3">III. CONSIDER why the&s;e endeavours are &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;cribed, or what good ends they may &s;ub&s;erve.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="010643_0010_0F81BDB10B952238">IV. PROVE that unconverted &s;inners are bound, and encouraged, thus to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P N="5">V. ANSWER objections.</P>
<P N="1">I. OUR fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to declare what are tho&s;e endeavours or duties which are here in|tended. And as it is not my de&s;ign under this head to vindicate the obligation of the&s;e duties, or inculcate an attendance to them, but only &s;hew what I would be under&s;tood to mean by tho&s;e performances, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be required of men unregenerate, I &s;hall aim at brevity.</P>
<P>THE duties or endeavours, which are now to be enquired into, are manife&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to be antecedent to a man's fir&s;t conver&s;ion;, and to have &s;ome &s;ub&s;erviency to his obtaining the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life: They are &s;ome way conducive to his obtaining a &s;aving under&s;tanding and belief of the go&s;pel. And therefore, the&s;e duties mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;up|po&s;ed to be of &s;uch a kind, as men are capable of performing before they are converted. To &s;peak of duties required in order to conver&s;ion, which none are capable of performing till they are converted, is gro&s;ly ab&s;urd. If any endea|vours are required of men as in any re&s;pect con|ducive to their obtaining ju&s;tifying faith, the&s;e mu&s;t be understood to be of &s;uch a kind, as they are by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance capable of, before they are in a ju&s;tified &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010643_0011_0F81BDB1CCFEB4B8">BUT to give &s;ome further opening to our &s;ub|ject, let it be ob&s;erved, that as the duties or en|deavours we are now con&s;idering are not of the nature of true holine&s;s, &s;o they do not infer any moral fitne&s;s for, or worthine&s;s of the &s;aving or effectual grace of God. Their &s;ub&s;erviency to our conver&s;ion is in a quite different way; that is, by "removing tho&s;e impediments in us which would otherwi&s;e unavoidably hinder our receiv|ing this grace," as one expre&s;&s;es it;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Willard.</NOTE> by pre|paring the &s;oul for the reception, and exerci&s;e of the &s;piritual life; and by bringing and keep|ing us in the way of God's ble&s;&s;ing; that is, in an attendance to tho&s;e means, by which it is or|dinarily conveyed to the children of men, as &s;hall, by God's help, be hereafter more fully ex|plained and proved. In the mean time, a few hints may throw &s;ome light upon our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>THERE are three things e&s;pecially which have a manife&s;t tendency to hinder a man's turning to God, thro' faith in Chri&s;t; namely, gro&s;s igno|rance and error&mdash;&s;tupid incon&s;ideratene&s;s&mdash;and wilful oppo&s;ition to the dictates of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>AS it is the truth revealed in the word of God that is the object of faith, and means or in&s;tru|ment of conver&s;ion, &s;o it is plain that he who is gro&s;ly ignorant of, or mi&s;taken about the great doctrines or precepts of divine revelation, is in|capable, &s;o long as he remains in this &s;tate, of perceiving the &s;piritual glory of the go&s;pel, which is that peculiar evidence of its truth and
<PB N="13" REF="010643_0012_0F81BDB359332048">
divinity which &s;aving faith is grounded upon. And it is equally plain that &s;uch a one is inca|pable of being begotten again, in the ordinary manner of the Spirit's operation, even by the incorruptible &s;eed of the word of God, till the truth there revealed is admitted into his mind.</P>
<P>MOREOVER a &s;tupid and incon&s;iderate di&s;re|gard of the great concerns of religion, is a fatal ob&s;tacle in the way of a &s;inner's conver&s;ion, not only as it naturally tends to &s;ettle him down in ignorance and error, but al&s;o becau&s;e it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that his attention and &s;erious concern be awakened, in order to his perceiving the evi|dence, and feeling the influence of the go&s;pel. No adult per&s;on is brought into a &s;tate of &s;alva|tion till he is fir&s;t rou&s;ed, from his carele&s;s &s;ecu|rity, and becomes &s;eriou&s;ly &s;olicitous about the concerns of eternity.</P>
<P>FINALLY, wilful oppo&s;ition to the light and dictates of con&s;cience, e&s;pecially when long per|&s;i&s;ted in, leads on, in its natural tendency, and by the righteous judgment of God, to hardne&s;s of heart, and a reprobate mind. The con&s;ci|ence, in con&s;equence of &s;uch outrageous violence and oppo&s;ition to its dictates, becomes feared as with an hot iron. The apo&s;tle &s;peaking of per|&s;ons of this character, &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. 2.11.</NOTE> "For this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ions, that they may believe a lie; that they all might be damn|ed that believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." And &s;peaking of him&s;elf, tho' he magnifies exceedingly the grace mani|fe&s;ted
<PB N="14" REF="010643_0013_0F81BDB407E414A0">
in his conver&s;ion, and intimates that hence|forth the chief of &s;inners need not de&s;pair, yet in the bo&s;om of this declaration, he gives a very alarming hint to tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to &s;in wil|fully, in oppo&s;ition to the conviction of their own minds, when he &s;ays, "I was a bla&s;phemer, &amp;c. but I obtained mercy, becau&s;e I did it ignorant|ly in unbelief."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.13, compare Luke 23.34.</NOTE></P>
<P>To prepare the &s;oul for the introduction and exerci&s;e of a new and &s;piritual principle, tis pre|viou&s;ly requi&s;ite that there be &s;ome competent doctrinal acquaintance with the main articles of the chri&s;tian religion, together with a conviction of our own character and condition: There mu&s;t be a &s;erious concern to be delivered from the mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of &s;in and guilt, and obtain eternal life: And a diligent care to comply with the dictates of con&s;cience, and improve that grace and influence of the Holy Spirit, which is ordinarily granted to tho&s;e who have the out|ward means of chri&s;tian knowledge. Of this a &s;inner is capable before he is renewed by the &s;pecial operation of the Holy Spirit; and accord|ing to the order which God is plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve in di&s;pen&s;ing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, this preparatory work of grace, with tho&s;e duties or exerci&s;es which are connected with, and prompted by it, are ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary, to make way for tho&s;e &s;pecial and &s;aving influences of the Spirit, where|by we are effectually renewed in the &s;pirit of our minds, and &s;o enabled to believe in Chri&s;t to the &s;aving of our &s;ouls, and turn to God thro' him.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010643_0014_0F81BDB71CFCAF50">BUT the&s;e things mu&s;t be called over again, and examined more di&s;tinctly in another place; &s;o I do but hint briefly, &s;o far as may &s;erve to give &s;ome light to the point now under con&s;ide|ration. For it is in the u&s;e of in&s;tituted means, or in the way of attendance to pre&s;cribed duties, that ignorant and &s;ecure &s;inners are awakened, convinced and humbled, and then &s;avingly en|lightened, and converted to God, thro' &s;anctifi|cation of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.&mdash;And hence we may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure directed in our pre&s;ent enquiry, what are tho&s;e means and endeavours for obtaining the meat that en|dureth to everla&s;ting life, which are primarily intended, and pre&s;cribed to &s;inners in our text.</P>
<P>IN general then, whatever tends to confirm them in their ignorance and errors, in their &s;tu|pidity and incon&s;ideratene&s;s, and in their cour&s;es of pre&s;umptuous &s;inning, mu&s;t be carefully a|voided; and whatever conduces to enlighten their minds, to enlarge, clear and rectify their apprehen&s;ions of divine things, to impre&s;s &s;eri|ous &s;entiments or convictions upon their hearts, to call them off from their &s;inful cour&s;es, and produce a reformation of their lives, mu&s;t be di|ligently attended to and improved for this end. More particularly, they mu&s;t guard again&s;t &s;en|&s;uality, or an exce&s;&s;ive indulgence to the plea|&s;ures and delights of the body. The&s;e will na|turally &s;ink them into &s;loth and &s;ecurity, draw off the thoughts and attention from the concerns of another life, and beget an in&s;en&s;ibility of the mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of &s;in and guilt, and the happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="010643_0015_0F81BDB832800638">
of being at peace and favour with God, and in a word, confirm an habitual inattention to, and unmindfulne&s;s of, the important motives which the go&s;pel propo&s;es, to awaken a concern about their &s;ouls &s;alvation. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, an immoderate carefulne&s;s about, and eager pur&s;uit after any worldly or temporal in|tere&s;t, mu&s;t al&s;o be avoided. This will &s;oon &s;tifle convictions, quench the Spirit, and ob&s;truct the good effect of the means of grace: It will choke the good &s;eed &s;own in their hearts, and lead on to many fooli&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition. Evil company is another dangerous &s;nare they ought carefully to &s;hun. Experience abundantly proves that this has a mighty tendency to abate our earne&s;tne&s;s, and diligence in &s;eeking the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s; and leads on to the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and heart-har|dening cour&s;es. In fine, all &s;inful diver&s;ions or amu&s;ements do &s;tupify the con&s;cience, and un|fit the &s;oul for &s;erious exerci&s;es: The&s;e mu&s;t therefore be renounced, as of mo&s;t dangerous tendency.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, there are outward means and duties to be attended to, together with pro|per exerci&s;es of the mind in and upon them, in order to remove our ignorance, correct our er|rors, excite and cheri&s;h conviction and religious concern, produce a reformation in our lives, and lead us to that faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and repen|tance towards God, to which the &s;pecial promi&s;e of the go&s;pel are annexed. We mu&s;t particu|larly
<PB N="17" REF="010643_0016_0F81BDB90122A640">
read and hear the word of God, which is the great ordinance or in&s;trument, whereby the knowledge of the truth, and &s;aving belief of it is conveyed to our minds: We mu&s;t al&s;o me|ditate on what we read and hear agreable to the&s;e holy oracles, and con&s;ider the evidences of their divine authority. We mu&s;t examine our &s;piri|tual &s;tate by this rule, and reflect upon our &s;ins in their &s;everal aggravations, together with the dreadful wages annexed to them. And that this may be done in the mo&s;t &s;erious and affect|ing manner, we mu&s;t pray to God for that grace and mercy we need, with humble confe&s;&s;ions of our &s;ins, and ju&s;t condemnation. This is a mo&s;t &s;olemn way of meditation, excellently adapted to impre&s;s the great truths of religion deeply on our &s;ouls, and &s;o affect our hearts with a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible conviction of their infinite importance, and render them powerfully influential on the temper and practice. The&s;e duties are e&s;peci|ally to be ob&s;erved at tho&s;e times and &s;ea&s;ons, which are peculiarly appropriated to religious exerci&s;es. In particular the Lord's day mu&s;t be remembred and kept holy, agreable to the de|&s;ign of its in&s;titution. I might al&s;o mention re|ligious fa&s;ting and humiliation, as an ordinance recommended by &s;cripture, and the practice of holy men in all ages. But I need not enlarge any fur|ther on the&s;e things. What is ordinarily meant by the means of grace, is well enough under&s;tood. A diligent attendance on the&s;e, with a proper exerci&s;e of mind therein, comprehends the &s;um of tho&s;e endeavours which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be primarily required of &s;inners in the text, and of which this di&s;cour&s;e is chiefly to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010643_0017_0F81BDB94C8EC090">BUT it may be enquired, has a man any power or capacity to perform the&s;e duties or exerci&s;es, till he be endowed with the grace of regenera|tion, and that faith which is the principle of all acceptable obedience, as well as the means or condition of ju&s;tification?&mdash;Are not unrenewed &s;inners in a &s;tate of &s;piritual death, utterly de&s;ti|tute of any power or will unto any thing that is good, without any &s;incere de&s;ires of the go&s;pel-&s;alvation, and therefore morally incapable of &s;eeking for it?</P>
<P>THIS is an enquiry of great importance. A right re&s;olution of it will go far towards deciding the di&s;pute concerning the obligation, and en|couragement of the unregenerate, to a diligent u&s;e of the means of grace, in order to obtain &s;alvation. Our &s;econd head will be chiefly oc|cupied in examining, and &s;tating this point: And accordingly I &s;hall now proceed to it.</P>
<P N="2">II. I AM to con&s;ider what power, or principle of action, there is in a natural or unregenerate man, whereby he may be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of tho&s;e endeavours, which have been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>AND that we may have a more clear and di&s;tinct view of this point, I &s;hall endeavour, in the fir&s;t place, to explain and fix the &s;en&s;e, in which this enquiry, concerning the power of men unregenerate, is to be under&s;tood.&mdash;Then I &s;hall con&s;ider briefly, what is the &s;tate of fallen man, previous to regeneration and conver&s;ion.&mdash;After that we may be able to determine whether man, in his lap&s;ed and depraved &s;tate, before he is born again, has any power to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life, in the manner that has been declared.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010643_0018_0F81BDBA2AB2D8E0">THE meaning of this enquiry, concerning the power of fallen man to labour, endeavour, &amp;c. mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place be explained; becau&s;e it is more than po&s;&s;ible, that the conceptions of &s;ome concerning the true &s;tate of this que&s;tion, are not &s;ufficiently determinate. We are to ob|&s;erve then, that the que&s;tion is not, whether we have an independant power of our own, to do any thing that may be available to our obtaining e|ternal life. For not only fallen man, but all other creatures, are every moment dependant upon God intirely for their being and all their powers. Nor are we to under&s;tand the enquiry to be about what is commonly called the natural power or capacity of fallen man, for tho&s;e performances, or endea|vours, before mentioned. For in this re&s;pect, there is no e&s;&s;ential difference, between the unre|generate and the regenerate. The &s;ame faculties of under&s;tanding and will, and executive power, phy&s;ically con&s;idered, belong to both. No one I think can or will pretend, that the&s;e duties are beyond the natural ability of a &s;inner, provided he has a di&s;po&s;ition or will to ob&s;erve them. He is undoubtedly as able to read and hear the word of God, as he is to read and hear di&s;cour&s;es upon different &s;ubjects: To think or meditate upon the concerns of his &s;alvation, as to be mu&s;ing on things of no con&s;equence: To con&s;ider and enquire how he may be &s;aved, as to put the mo&s;t trifling and impertinent que&s;tions: To implore the mercy of God upon him, as to petition for a favour from any of his fellow men: To attend diligently to the religious duties of the Lord's day, as to pro|fane it by idlene&s;s, by worldly conver&s;ation, or un|lawful diver&s;ions. The point then to be deter|mined
<PB N="20" REF="010643_0019_0F81BDBAC7DA6FE0">
by us, I think is this, <HI>Whether man, in his fallen and depraved &s;tate, has any moral power to perform the&s;e duties?</HI>&mdash;Or to &s;peak in more plain and determinate language, <HI>Whether there be in men unregenerate any principle, which may be a foun|dation of their having a will to endeavour and &s;trive to be delivered from a &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery, and obtain eternal life and &s;alvation, and accordingly u&s;e means for this purpo&s;e?</HI> Or to vary the expre&s;&s;ion yet again, <HI>Is it con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of &s;in, that a man &s;hould de&s;ire to be &s;aved, and &s;o become di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek &s;alvation by attending the&s;e in&s;trumental du|ties pre&s;cribed for this end?</HI></P>
<P>AND that we may be able to give a just and plain re&s;olution of this important enquiry, it will be needful that we con&s;ider, what is the &s;tate of fallen man unregenerate?</P>
<P>THIS is what I propo&s;ed in the next place to enquire into, and declare. I cannot now under|take to di&s;cu&s;s this point fully and minutely, but mu&s;t only hint a few things, &s;o far as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AND here it is readily granted that unregene|rate &s;inners are &s;piritually dead, or in other words dead in &s;in. What this expre&s;&s;ion imports, will be con&s;idered immediately:&mdash;But that this cha|racter belongs to all men, except tho&s;e who are born again, and &s;o endowed with a vital princple by the Holy Gho&s;t, I think cannot be denyed, un|le&s;s &s;ome medium can be found between life and death. In regeneration there is communicated to the &s;oul that &s;piritual life and power, whereby we are prompted and enabled &s;incerely to repent of, and turn from &s;in unto God, and live to him in
<PB N="21" REF="010643_0020_0F81BDBB9E981F70">
the exerci&s;e or practice of evangelical holine&s;s. All who are the &s;ubjects of this &s;piritual life and power, are born of the Spirit, and according to the &s;cripture phra&s;e, are quickned, or made alive to God: And of con&s;equence all who are de&s;ti|tute hereof, are in that re&s;pect dead. There is then no rea&s;on for confining this character to hea|thens and the mo&s;t abandoned &s;inners, unle&s;s we will &s;ay, that all be&s;ides &s;uch are rai&s;ed from the death of &s;in, and have the &s;piritual or divine life begun in their &s;ouls; that is, unle&s;s all be&s;ides heathen Idolaters are born of God. For I think it mu&s;t be allowed, that the&s;e are expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame import, at lea&s;t that they nece&s;&s;arily im|ply each other.</P>
<P>SINCE then every man before regeneration is in a &s;tate of &s;piritual death, it mu&s;t now be enquired, what is the true notion of &s;uch a &s;tate, and how are we to conceive of the impotency and indi&s;po|&s;ition of fallen man to that which is good?</P>
<P>SPIRITUAL death then con&s;i&s;ts primarily and formally in the want of that holy rectitude or in|tegrity of nature, that habitual conformity of &s;oul to the will of God, which is the principle, or foun|dation of tho&s;e views, affections and exerci&s;es, which have the &s;pecific nature of true holine&s;s. There is a divine beauty and excellency in true holine&s;s, and in contra&s;t hereunto a corre&s;pondent evil and turpitude in &s;in, which they who are &s;pi|ritually dead are in&s;en&s;ible of. There is &s;uch a change wrought in the &s;oul of a &s;inner in regene|ration, that he has apprehen&s;ions, affections, pur|po&s;es, and acts, which are new, and of a different kind from what he had before. The proof of
<PB N="22" REF="010643_0021_0F81BDBC6B31F008">
this cannot now be entred upon. It will not how|ever I &s;uppo&s;e be denyed by any, who allow that true holine&s;s differs in its nature from all other endowments, or affections, or exerci&s;es of a rati|onal being. This, all who are &s;piritually dead, or under the power of &s;in, are, while in &s;uch a &s;tate, morally indi&s;po&s;ed unto and incapable of.</P>
<P>BUT though the &s;trict or preci&s;e notion of &s;pi|ritual death be the lo&s;s of this uprightne&s;s of na|ture, yet it mu&s;t be added, that it implies more than a bare privation of &s;piritual life and power. A po&s;itive depravity of nature, or a prevailing in|clination to that which is evil, will of cour&s;e en&s;ue upon the lo&s;s of habitual integrity. There is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing that any vicious taint is infu&s;ed, or any principles &s;imply and po&s;itively evil im|planted, in order to account for the corruption of human nature. As &s;oon as that union of the &s;oul to God, whereby the divine life &s;ub&s;i&s;ts is broken, the vital principle with all its acts or exerci&s;es will cea&s;e:&mdash;Of con&s;equence, the &s;inner will be go|verned in his conduct by &s;elf-love, with the na|tural appetites and affections. And hence he will not favour the things of God, but become alie|nated from the divine life, prone to, and full of vanity, folly and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT cannot then be &s;uppo&s;ed, that while a man is dead in &s;in, blind to the beauties of holine&s;s, in|di&s;po&s;ed and di&s;inclined to that which is &s;piritu|ally good, he &s;hould have any direct de&s;ire to be freed from the power of &s;in, and renewed after the image of God, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holi|ne&s;s; or &s;hould u&s;e any means or endeavours with a direct intention to obtain that of which he has
<PB N="23" REF="010643_0022_0F81BDBD0C49ACF8">
no ju&s;t idea, and which he does not truly and pro|perly de&s;ire, or delight in. It would be manife&s;t|ly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that any one &s;hould de&s;ire and endeavour after any thing, which is not ap|prehended or con&s;idered as good or agreable, in that re&s;pect in which it is de&s;ired and endeavoured after. While a man is ignorant and in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;piritual excellency of the new creature, and of the dignity and happine&s;s of the divine life in the &s;oul, but on the contrary is di&s;inclined to, and alienated from it, this will not be regarded by him as a proper object of his de&s;ires and endea|vours. To de&s;ire grace <HI>&s;incerely,</HI> is the effect and exerci&s;e of a gracious principle; even as it is a &s;ign and effect of a vital principle, to de&s;ire and &s;truggle for life.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS mankind, however depraved in all their faculties, are capable of feeling the force of moral obligation. A &s;inner may have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the, rea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e duties which are required of him, the authority of God over him, and the duty and wi&s;dom of &s;ubmitting to it, as that he may really de&s;ire, and endeavour to obey the divine commands, as to matter and &s;ub&s;tance of them. It cannot be denyed, that the wor&s;t of men have &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s and fitne&s;s of virtue, and the moral evil or turpitude of vice. For it is plain they have a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert: Their con&s;ciences te&s;tify that piety and benevolence, with all proper practical expre&s;&s;ions thereof, are right and good; and that when they &s;in wilfully, they are worthy of puni&s;h|ment. They who have no holy love to God and his laws, are yet &s;en&s;ible, from the dictates of con|&s;cience, that it is their duty to be obedient to the great creator and lawgiver, who is able to &s;ave
<PB N="24" REF="010643_0023_0F81BDBDE4222328">
and de&s;troy; and that his commands are ju&s;t and righteous: Otherwi&s;e they would not feel remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation when they tran&s;gre&s;s them. They have &s;ome natural notions of moral good and evil; and tho' the&s;e natural principles, and that obedience which flows merely from them are not &s;piritually good, as wanting what is e&s;&s;ential to evangelical holine&s;s, they are yet good and u&s;e|ful in &s;everal re&s;pects; as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew more fully hereafter. To this purpo&s;e &s;peaks a learned and eminent author,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Owen.</NOTE> <Q>Under the a&s;hes of our collap&s;ed nature there are yet remaining certain &s;parks of cele&s;tial fire, con|&s;i&s;ting in inbred notices of good and evil, of re|wards and puni&s;hments, of the pre&s;ence and all-&s;eeing eye of God, of help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be had from him, with a dread of his excellency where any thing is apprehended unworthy of him or provoking to him.</Q> They who are incapable of perceiving the mo&s;t divine excellency of true holine&s;s, who are not &s;truck with tho&s;e motives and rea&s;ons of duty which are of the &s;ublime&s;t kind, and fitted to produce the mo&s;t noble and divine movements of the heart, are yet capable of perceiving &s;o much of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and e|quity of God's commands, as that their temper and conduct may be much influenced thereby. There is in human nature a &s;en&s;e of duty or moral obligation, a con&s;cience which directs us what we ought to do, and warns us what we are to expect: And the&s;e natural principles may be &s;o wrought upon by motives, as that men may really de&s;ire and endeavour, in &s;ome &s;ort, to obey the divine com|mands, previous to regeneration. Moreover,</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="010643_0024_0F81BDBE8CD66C38">AS there is in human nature a de&s;ire of happi|ne&s;s and dread of mi&s;ery, mankind are capable of being moved by the promi&s;es and threatenings of the go&s;pel, to de&s;ire deliverance from the guilt and puni&s;hment of &s;in, and be happy hereafter in the favour of God; and hence they may be per|&s;uaded to u&s;e means and endeavours for this pur|po&s;e. Many without que&s;tion are excited from this principle to do much in religion, and &s;trive very earne&s;tly for &s;alvation. There is no com|mand which a man may not be per&s;uaded to ob|&s;erve, as to the matter of it, merely from &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation: And tho' what is done merely from this principle is not true holine&s;s, yet the principle is good, u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in it&s;elf, and may law|fully enough have its influence in all our obedi|ence to the divine commands.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, that the&s;e natural principles we have mentioned, which are all good and u&s;e|ful in them&s;elves, may be much improved and &s;trengthned by in&s;truction, exerci&s;e, and the com|mon influence of the Holy Spirit. Mankind are capable of a doctrinal or theoretic knowledge of the truths and duties of the go&s;pel. By a &s;edu|lous exerci&s;e of their minds in attending to the outward means of knowledge, they may obtain daily a clearer, and more exten&s;ive view of the doctrines and precepts of revelation. And there is a common influence of the Spirit, in a work of illumination, conviction, &amp;c. which men may experience while in an unconverted &s;tate, as &s;hall be proved in the &s;equel. By the&s;e means, the con&s;cience or moral &s;en&s;e, the de&s;ire of happi|ne&s;s, and dread of mi&s;ery, implanted in human na|ture, may become more quick, and have a &s;trong|er influence on the heart and life.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="010643_0025_0F81BDBF5618AD60">THE &s;ub&s;tance of what has been offered on this point is, that mankind by the fall have lo&s;t that holy rectitude or uprightne&s;s of nature, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the moral image of God; and are be|come &s;o corrupted and dead in &s;in, that until they are born again of the Spirit, they are indi&s;po&s;ed to, and morally incapable of any affections or ex|erci&s;es, which are &s;piritually good and holy. Nor have they &s;trictly &s;peaking any &s;incere de&s;ires to be delivered from this &s;tate of &s;piritual death, and have a principle of divine life communicated to them. But yet there are other principles or &s;prings of action in human nature, whereby they may be moved and excited to perform many du|ties required by God, though not in a holy man|ner, nor for holy ends. They may from a &s;en&s;e of the equity of God's commands, and the obli|gations they are under to be &s;ubject to his autho|rity, and from a natural de&s;ire of happine&s;s, be induced to endeavour carefully to frame their lives according to the rules of religion, and that not in mere pretence and gro&s;s hypocri&s;y, but with &s;erious engagedne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>AND hence we may ea&s;ily re&s;olve our <HI>third en|quiry,</HI> viz. whether man in his lap&s;ed and deprav|ed &s;tate, before he is born again, and has a &s;aving and &s;piritual under&s;tanding and belief of the go&s;|pel, has any power or capacity to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life. That mankind have a natural power, by the ordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, to perform the&s;e duties, if they are &s;o inclined, I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t be readily allowed; that men unregenerate are morally incapable of doing any thing in religion in a holy manner, mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, if the principle we have laid
<PB N="27" REF="010643_0026_0F81BDC01A76A498">
down be true, that that &s;upernatural life, power and grace, which is communicated to the &s;oul in regeneration, is nece&s;&s;ary unto all acts of holy e|vangelical obedience. But I think no one who under&s;tands him&s;elf, can deny that the natural prin|ciples of rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, when improved and excited by in&s;truction, exer|ci&s;e, and the common influences of the Holy Spi|rit, are a &s;ufficient foundation for tho&s;e de&s;ires and endeavours to obtain &s;alvation, which have been de&s;cribed under the foregoing head: And there|fore unregenerate men have a moral power in this manner, to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life. In plainer words, they may be|come inclined and willing &s;o to do.</P>
<P>THIS appears not only from what has been ar|gued from the nature of man, but al&s;o from un|deniable fact. Is it not certain that many while unregenerate, have &s;ought to enter in at the &s;trait gate? Common ob&s;ervation, as well as our Sa|viour's expre&s;s words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 13.24.</NOTE> will warrant us to a&s;&s;ert this. Yea perhaps it may appear in the &s;equel, that it is in the way of diligent &s;eeking, in attend|ance to the duties before &s;pecified, that the grace of regeneration, and the &s;aving knowledge of the truth are ordinarily obtained. Though man in a &s;tate of &s;in is not in a pre&s;ent moral capacity to perform religious duties in a holy manner, yet the performance it&s;elf is plainly within his power, by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Our natural principles of rea&s;on, con&s;cience and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, when informed with &s;uch knowledge of religion as men unregenerate are capable of, and excited by the common influence of the Spirit, are a &s;ufficient
<PB N="28" REF="010643_0027_0F81BDC1D041E168">
foundation for &s;uch a compliance with the &s;ub|&s;tance and matter of pre&s;cribed duties, as is here intended. If men have not a will to attend the common means of conver&s;ion, it is not becau&s;e an unregenerate &s;tate is incapable of it, but becau&s;e the voice of rea&s;on and con&s;cience is not hearkned to, becau&s;e tho&s;e notices of truth and duty which they have received are not regarded, and becau&s;e they will not pur&s;ue their own intere&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> is only an addition to your former being.

<P>BUT it will here be objected, that &s;alvation con|&s;i&s;ts in freedom from &s;in, and perfection in holi|ne&s;s, as well as exemption from the cur&s;e: But this is what no one in a &s;tate of &s;in de&s;ires.

<P>I ANSWER, how ab&s;urd &s;oever &s;ome may ima|gine it is to &s;peak of &s;inners &s;eeking &s;alvation, this is the expre&s;s language of &s;cripture, which ought to have &s;creened the expre&s;&s;ion from that cen&s;ure, which &s;ome cricical refiners have pre&s;umed to pa&s;s upon it.

it will not be allowed, I think, that a &s;corner has a direct &s;incere de&s;ire of true wi&s;dom; or that they who&s;e hearts were not right with God, &s;ought him in truth; or that &s;uch as fail of entring in at the &s;trait gate, do &s;eek for an entrance with that &s;in|cerity of de&s;ire and endeavour, which ari&s;es from a &s;piritual renovation of heart.

The prompting motive with &s;uch a one to u&s;e the&s;e means, is not indeed their &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ub&s;erviency to an end which he has not in view, nor wi&s;hes to obtain: But he may do it from a regard to other ends, which he may really de|&s;ire &amp; aim at. Yea he may act from &s;uch ends as are lawful and good in &s;ome re&s;pects, and in their proper place, as may be &s;hewn hereafter. And his endeavours may, by the will and appointment of God, land him happily at a point which at fir&s;t he thought not of arriving at. We may illu&s;trate this matter in &s;ome mea&s;ure perhaps by the fol|lowing &s;imile, however it may halt in &s;ome of its members. A man who is &s;ick and delirious, and who has conceived an aver&s;ion to his father, may be per&s;uaded for fear of his anger, and in hopes

of an inheritance, to follow &s;uch directions as are de&s;igned and &s;uited to re&s;tore him to his health, his rea&s;on, and dutiful affections: And accord|ingly by this means may find him&s;elf at length happily recovered from all his indi&s;po&s;itions, tho' in his di&s;ordered &s;tate he was neither &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;erable condition, nor had tho&s;e benefits in view, which he has found. So though men in a &s;tate of &s;in or &s;piritual death have not a &s;piritual apprehen&s;ion of the nature and excellency of &s;al|vation in its full extent, as revealed in the go&s;pel, and &s;o cannot have a direct aim at obtaining what they have no reli&s;h for, yet it is very &s;uppo&s;able, that they may, in obedience to the dictates of con&s;cience, and the natural principle of &s;elf-love, be induced to a diligent u&s;e of tho&s;e outward and ordinary means whereby the benefits of redemp|tion are ordinarily applied; and in this way may come to the &s;aving knowledge of the truth, and be born again of this incorrupible &s;eed. Moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. AN unregenerate man may attend to the or|dinary pre&s;cribed means of grace, with &s;ome de|&s;ires that he may obtain the end which they are ordained to &s;ub&s;erve: He may, in &s;ome &s;ort, re|ally de&s;ire and hope that, in the u&s;e of the&s;e means, he &s;hall receive further light and influence from the Holy Spirit, that &s;o his feet may be guided in the way of peace, and he may find re&s;t to his &s;oul. Tis true indeed, &s;uch a one has no direct and &s;incere will and purpo&s;e to obtain that faith and repentance which the go&s;pel requires, &s;o long as he is in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;piritual glory of the go&s;|pel, and does not acquie&s;ce in the method of di|vine grace therein revealed. But he may have real de&s;ires to obtain further degrees of that com|mon

light and grace, which is ordinarily prepa|ratory to conver&s;ion: Yea, he may have real de|&s;ires of &s;alvation, not indeed in its full extent, nor on account of the &s;piritual excellency of the ble&s;&s;ings propo&s;ed in the go&s;pel, but becau&s;e of their natural &s;uitablene&s;s to his wants, as a con|demned &s;inful creature.</P>
<P>I TAKE it for granted, that a man who is not &s;avingly enlightned and renewed, may be con|vinced that he is a &s;inner, that the wages of &s;in is death, and that the go&s;pel contains a revelation of mercy to the ungodly. Now the&s;e &s;parks of light, if I may &s;o &s;peak, which are in the under|&s;tanding, the&s;e notices of truth, which by the com|mon influence of the divine Spirit, are conveyed to the mind, either from the works or word of God, may excite the attention to further mani|fe&s;tations of divine truth. An imperfect view of the go&s;pel doctrine, however indi&s;tinct and erro|neous, may awaken an enquiry after a fuller and clearer knowledge; and that not to amu&s;e a vain curio&s;ity, but from a &s;erious concern to e&s;cape the wrath to come. And though no one will take pains to find him&s;elf guilty and mi&s;erable, &s;ince it is contrary to nature to &s;eek mi&s;ery, yet a general apprehen&s;ion and partial conviction of guilt, may put a man upon a &s;erious enquiry into his &s;piritual &s;tate: It may fully convince him, than he ought not to &s;hake off tho&s;e di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions which have begun to ari&s;e in his mind: That it would be mo&s;t dangerous pre&s;umption to indulge him&s;elf in &s;ecurity and incon&s;ideratene&s;s, while he has &s;o much rea&s;on to fear that he is in a bad ca&s;e. And hence he may be prompted to &s;eek a more thorough acquaintance with him&s;elf, and with the
<PB N="32" REF="010643_0031_0F81BDC6E77A8588">
word of God, the rule by which he is to judge of his own ca&s;e, and which opens the only way of &s;al|vation to the guilty. Thus, as Solomon &s;peaks, "he may cry for knowledge, and lift up his voice for under&s;tanding, &s;eek for it as &s;ilver, and &s;earch for it as for hid trea&s;ure;" and &s;o obtain further degrees of knowledge, conviction, humiliation, and be in a nearer capacity for &s;aving illumination, faith and conver&s;ion; as will be more fully explained and proved hereafter. And accordingly it is certain from fact, that when &s;inners begin to be awakened, they &s;ometimes cheri&s;h &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s, and lay to heart their mi&s;erable ca&s;e: They are atten|tive to the revelation of grace and truth in the di|vine word: And &s;o a religious concern is more deeply impre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;en&s;ibility of their heart increa&s;es. And &s;ometimes when they are made to tremble, as Felix did at the preaching of Paul, they practically &s;ay with him, "go thy way for this time, and at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on I will call for thee." They take pains to wear off the un|ea&s;y impre&s;&s;ion among vain companions, worldly cares, or carnal plea&s;ures, &s;o quench the Spirit, and become more hardned and &s;ecure than ever.</P>
<P>NOW though it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the agency of the good Spirit, that a &s;ecure &s;inner is fir&s;t a|wakened, and then directed and inclined to think upon his ways, to attend the common means of in|&s;truction, and &s;o &s;eek further light and aids from God, yet it cannot be &s;aid that the rever&s;e conduct of other &s;inners is owing to any natural or moral in|capacity in&s;eperably connected with an unregene|rate &s;tate. Tis voluntary wickedne&s;s and folly, which indeed flows from the corruption of unre|newed nature, but is an accidental, not a nece&s;&s;ary or univer&s;al effect.</P>

And tho' this be not what is commonly meant by converting grace,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I u&s;e the word grace here, and in many places in this di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;ignify a divine influence upon the &s;oul, of a &s;alutary tendency.

<HEAD>SERMON II. The Ends for which Duties are requir|ed of the Unregenerate, and to be performed by them.</HEAD>
<P>THE nature of the duties &s;uppo&s;ed to be re|quired of men in order to conver&s;ion, and their power for the performance of them have been con&s;idered. It will be ob&s;erved, that I have not hitherto offered any direct proof, that the&s;e duties are pre&s;cribed to the unregenerate, for &s;uch an end. Concerning this I &s;hall only &s;ay at pre&s;ent, that I think this &s;uppo&s;ition is at lea&s;t countenanced by our text. But be this as it may, it is not my intention to pa&s;s a naked &s;uppo&s;ition upon any one in the place of a proof. The truth of this point &s;hall in its proper place be particu|larly examined. And in the mean time begging the patience of tho&s;e who are di&s;&s;atisfied (if there, be any &s;uch) I &s;hall proceed to explain the &s;ubject a little further, and endeavour to relieve &s;ome
<PB N="38" REF="010643_0037_0F81BDCB4E4F96E8">
further doubts and difficulties, that &s;o the way may be better prepared for a more direct confirmation of our capital point.</P>
<P>AND a very material enquiry will now ari&s;e, which I mu&s;t endeavour to an&s;wer as well as I can, viz. Is it rea&s;onable to think that a man's eternal intere&s;t can be &s;erved by tho&s;e performances which have not the nature of holy obedience? Can the &s;inful doings of the unregenerate be of any avail, except to in|hance their guilt?</P>
<P>TO this I &s;cruple not to &s;ay, that mens ob&s;erving the duties required of them in the go&s;pel from na|tural principles, is much better than a total neglect and contempt of them; and may be conducive to very valuable purpo&s;e, no le&s;s than the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls; as I hope to make appear under the</P>
<P N="3">III. GENERAL head, which was to con&s;ider why &s;inners are to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life, and what good end it can be &s;uppo&s;ed to an&s;wer. It is of no &s;mall importance that we have right conceptions of this matter: And yet it is more than probable that &s;ome have wrong notions concerning the ends of mens endeavours in &s;eeking &s;alvation. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider this point both negatively and po&s;itively. And</P>
<P N="1">1. I SHALL mention &s;ome wrong ends which men often propo&s;e in religious duties. There are many, who will do much in religion, and take great pains to frame their lives according to the rules of God's word, while their de&s;igns herein are &s;uch as the go&s;pel &s;trongly militates again&s;t. This is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who perform duties for &s;elf-righteous purpo&s;es. And though I deny not but that &s;elf-righteous endeavours may be a means of good to
<PB N="39" REF="010643_0038_0F81BDCC10183188">
men, by giving them an experimental conviction of the in&s;ufficiency of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength, yet no one mu&s;t be encouraged to per|form duties for &s;uch ends as ought not to be pro|po&s;ed, or cannot be obtained. On the contrary it &s;hould be the care of every one who would &s;peak as it becomes the oracles of God, while exhorting men to the ob&s;ervance of duties, to caution again&s;t all dangerous mi&s;takes as to the place and u&s;e of human endeavours. But to be more particular.</P>
<P>NO one is required to do any thing to atone or &s;atisfy for his pa&s;t offences. The go&s;pel utterly di&s;allows our attempting the performance of any duty for &s;uch an intention. And yet it is natural to mankind, when pre&s;&s;ed with a conviction of guilt, to endeavour the expiation of their pa&s;t crimes, by their future obedience. This has given ri&s;e to a world of &s;uper&s;tition, not only among Pagans, but nominal Chri&s;tians. Witne&s;s the au&s;terities and &s;a|tisfactory penances impo&s;ed and practi&s;ed in the church of Rome. Nor have Prote&s;tants been al|ways free from this error. Many no doubt have thought that their charitable di&s;tributions to the poor would cover a multitude of &s;ins. Hence alm&s;|hou&s;es and ho&s;pitals have been erected and endow|ed, and large &s;ums given away to the indigent by people in the la&s;t moments of life, in hopes that this would compen&s;ate for their former mi&s;carriages. Others have had the &s;ame intention in their fa&s;tings, prayers and devotional exerci&s;es. But this is a vain thought. God requires nothing of &s;inners as an atonement for &s;in. The be&s;t &s;ervices of the holie&s;t man upon earth, yea of the holie&s;t angel in heaven, will not expiate the guilt of one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="40" REF="010643_0039_0F81BDCD232BEBE8">
Surely then unholy performances will not be ac|cepted as a fit &s;atisfaction for multiplied and heinous offences. Our be&s;t and our wor&s;t actions are alike unavailable in this ca&s;e. Tis the peculiar honour of Chri&s;t's obedience and &s;acrifice to take away the guilt of &s;in. His work is fully &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e; none of ours are required, or may be added as coefficient with it.</P>
<P>NOR are the&s;e duties required, or to be perform|ed, as meritorious of the favour and kindne&s;s of God, or as rendring us worthy objects of his mercy. This is the end that &s;ome have in their religious &s;ervices. They may indeed own, that it is only the blood of Chri&s;t the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world: Yet they have a notion of rendring them&s;elves worthy to have the benefits purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, applied or be&s;towed upon them. They have a &s;ecret thought (tho' they may di&s;claim the pretence of merit) that by their reading, hearing, praying, attending ordinances, and endea|vouring to reform their manners, there will be &s;uch a change in them for the better, &s;uch a difference from the profane, that they will hereby become worthy of a favourable regard: And that after they have &s;hewn &s;o good a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o much re&s;pect to God's commands, they may be warrant|ed to advance &s;ome peculiar claim upon the divine mercy, as &s;ubjects morally qualified for it, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e worthy of it.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;criptures will ju&s;tify no &s;uch conclu&s;ions. There we are taught, "that by grace we are &s;aved, thro' &s;aith, not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t." The meritorious procurement of &s;alvation is the work of Chri&s;t, and was fini&s;hed when he ro&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="010643_0040_0F81BDCDA33FAA98">
from the dead. The gracious purpo&s;es of God to|wards fallen man, had their ri&s;e from his infinite &s;o|vereign mercy, and not from any worthine&s;s beheld in the &s;ubject. And after God had decreed to glo|rify the riches of his grace in &s;aving &s;ome of the lap&s;ed race of men, the atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and not any ab&s;olute or comparative wor|thine&s;s of ours, is the moral ground or con&s;ideration of the be&s;towment of &s;alvation upon the ve&s;&s;els of mercy. It &s;eemed meet to infinite wi&s;dom, that eternal life &s;hould be purcha&s;ed for men by a price of &s;ufficient value, that his holine&s;s as well as mercy might be glorified, in his be&s;towing the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings upon the ungodly. But no obedience of ours is of any value to purcha&s;e eternal life. If we had done all that is required of us, we &s;hould &s;till have rea&s;on to &s;ay that we were unprofitable &s;er|vants, and de&s;erved no thanks. For the mo&s;t per|fect obedience which our natural faculties are capa|ble of attaining to, is no more than our pre&s;ent duty requires. Mu&s;t it not then be great vanity and pre&s;umption in a &s;inner, to think him&s;elf at all worthy of eternal life, on account of &s;uch corrupt and &s;inful &s;ervices as his be&s;t actions are? Tis not from re&s;pect to any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s that we have done, but according to God's mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we are delivered from a &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery, and brought into a &s;tate of &s;alvation. And when men apply them&s;elves to the practice of re|ligious duties, that they may thereby recommend them&s;elves to God, as worthy objects of his &s;aving mercy, they, as much as in them lies, fru&s;trate the divine grace, and &s;ub&s;titute their own righteou&s;ne&s;s in that place which the go&s;pel a&s;&s;igns &s;olely to the work and atonement of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="010643_0041_0F81BDCE52864F40">IT mu&s;t be further added, that the&s;e duties, of which we are now treating, are not required of men unregenerate as a covenant term or condition of ac|ceptance with God; &s;o as that upon their perform|ance of them, they &s;hould become intitled, by virtue of God's promi&s;e, to ju&s;tification and eternal life. We have no covenant-right to eternal life and &s;alvation, unle&s;s we &s;tand right according to that rule, by which we are directed to examine our&s;elves, whether we are in a &s;tate of peace with God, and heirs of &s;alvation; and by which mankind will be judged, and their &s;tate determined by Chri&s;t, at the la&s;t day: That is the go&s;pel. But no actions or exerci&s;es of the unconverted an&s;wer the requirements of the go&s;pel. All who are in &s;uch a &s;tate, far from having a promi&s;e of eternal life, are expre&s;ly de|clared to be under condemnation and the wrath of God. Nothing that is wrought in; or done by an impenitent unconverted &s;inner, antecedent to faith and conver&s;ion, will give him an intere&s;t in the pro|mi&s;e of &s;alvation, according to the go&s;pel which is (more properly than faith) the in&s;trument of ju&s;ti|fication, or the rule, according to which the benefits of redemption are applied to, and be&s;towed upon men. How diligent and con&s;cientious &s;oever a man may be in &s;eeking and &s;triving to obtain &s;alvation, till he is truly and effectually converted, he is under condemnation; and then &s;urely the promi&s;es of &s;alvation, which are con&s;tantly limited to believers and penitents, cannot po&s;&s;ibly belong to him.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the&s;e duties are not enjoined on the un|converted, nor to be performed by them, as having a promi&s;e of faith, or the grace of regeneration an|nexed to them. We cannot &s;ay, that God has a&s;&s;ured impenitent &s;inners by any promi&s;e, that if

they attend to the pre&s;cribed means of grace, they &s;hall certainly be born again of the Spirit, and &s;o enter into his heavenly kingdom. I know there have been great controver&s;ies, and of long &s;tanding, concerning promi&s;es to the endeavours of the un|converted. It is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute this point: Others have done it &s;ufficiently already. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that though there is abundant en|couragement for awakened &s;inners to attend the common means of conver&s;ion, as &s;hall hereafter be proved, yet I mu&s;t acknowledge that I know of no promi&s;es of regeneration, or effectual grace, that are claimable by any unconverted man. Nor can I ap|prehend, that if there were indeed &s;uch promi&s;es as &s;ome plead for, they would give any &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who are thoroughly pained with a conviction of their &s;in and guilt. It will not I think be pre|tended by any, that there is a promi&s;e of a &s;inner's finding mercy, if his endeavours are cold and &s;lack; or if he long delays the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;eeking &s;alvati|on, after having been earne&s;tly called and urged thereunto. But how will a man be able to deter|mine to the &s;atisfaction of an awakened con&s;cience, with what degree of earne&s;tne&s;s a &s;inner mu&s;t &s;trive, in order to fulfil the condition of the promi&s;e; and how &s;oon he mu&s;t begin to mind in earne&s;t the con|cerns of eternity; and whether he may not already have de&s;erved the matter &s;o long, that the promi&s;ed grace may be forfeited irrecoverably. Such en|quiries have, I think, never been an&s;wered clearly and pertinently; and therefore the &s;uppo&s;ition up|on which they are founded &s;eems to have a tendency rather to perplex and di&s;courage the mo&s;t &s;erious minds, than to give any relief or excitement to duty. For what man who&s;e con&s;cience is not greatly &s;eared,
<PB N="44" REF="010643_0043_0F81BDD205986F20">
but mu&s;t own, that he has given God high provo|cation to ca&s;t him off, and &s;hew him no mercy, becau&s;e he has &s;o long neglected the great &s;alvation that has been propo&s;ed to him, and &s;till continues not to regard it in any proportion to its importance? I think it will be very pre&s;umptuous for a &s;inner to conclude, that God has bound him&s;elf by promi&s;e, to extend his &s;aving mercy to one who has been &s;o dilatory and &s;lack, in labouring for the meat which endureth to eternal life, as every unregenerate man, who is thoroughly awakened, mu&s;t be convinced that him&s;elf has been.</P>
<P>TO proceed, the&s;e duties and endeavours of which we now treat, are not pre&s;cribed to us as the means and way to move the divine mercy and pity towards us. No one ought to be encouraged to &s;trive for eternal life, from an expectation that he &s;hall hereby excite God's compa&s;&s;ion towards him. God's mercy is infinite. The communications and exer|ci&s;es of his goodne&s;s and grace, are free. Divine mercy does not wait for any good di&s;po&s;itions in us to draw it forth into exerci&s;e. When God de|creed to manife&s;t the glory of his mercy and grace in &s;aving &s;ome of mankind from &s;in and death, and accordingly provided and appointed a redeemer for them, he regarded them as mi&s;erable creatures, and at the &s;ame time mo&s;t unworthy. And in carrying his gracious decree into execution, by applying the benefits of redemption to the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, his grace prevents all amiable qualifications in them. And if any one is made &s;en&s;ible of the danger and mi&s;ery of a &s;inful &s;tate, &s;o as that he &s;eeks earne&s;tly to God for deliverance, this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an effect of divine mercy, in opening his eyes to &s;ee his peri&s;hing condition while there is a po&s;&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="45" REF="010643_0044_0F81BDD2AEE6ED70">
and hope of his being happily &s;aved from it. For, as has been already noted, it is owing to pre|venting grace that &s;inners are prompted, and en|abled to do any thing, that has any tendency to their &s;piritual advantage.</P>
<P>I MUST only add, that the duties or endeavours which God has pre&s;cribed to the unregenerate, are not pre&s;cribed becau&s;e there is any &s;piritual goodne&s;s in the performances of &s;uch per&s;ons. We ought not to think, that actions flowing merely from na|tural principles are go&s;pel holine&s;s, or will be ap|proved accepted and rewarded by God as &s;uch. Men cannot rightly take encouragement to attend the means of conver&s;ion, by imagining that &s;uch an attendance as they while unconverted are capable of giving, will be regarded by God, as having the na|ture of holy obedience. On the contrary they &s;hould be humbly &s;en&s;ible, that till their natures are &s;avingly renewed, their mo&s;t &s;erious and earne&s;t en|deavours are &s;inful, thro' a defect in the principle and end. Indeed the be&s;t actions of men unrege|nerate are good in &s;ome re&s;pects, and in their proper place; and from this con&s;ideration, among others, they may with propriety be exhorted to duties; as &s;hall be &s;hewn pre&s;ently. But nothing done by men antecedent to conver&s;ion, is in the e&s;timation of God evangelical holine&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS far I have endeavoured to &s;hew for what purpo&s;es the duties we are now treating of are not required, and am willing to acknowledge we ought not to think that any endeavours of the unregene|rate will avail to expiate their pa&s;t &s;ins, or recom|mend them to God as worthy objects of his favour, or give them a covenant title to &s;alvation, or the
<PB N="46" REF="010643_0045_0F81BDD386406EF0">
grace of regeneration, or move the divine pity and mercy towards them, nor are they of the nature of go&s;pel holine&s;s. And whoever con&s;iders the &s;ub|ject in a practical view, will I hope indulge my en|larging a little on the negative part, &s;ince tis likely that many are in danger of acting from &s;uch mi&s;taken ends and views as have here been mentioned. And hence in&s;tead of being guided to Chri&s;t, and having their eyes directed to him, as the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world, they are turned and fixed on a delu&s;ion; and &s;o are in danger of &s;pending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which will not &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>BUT the enquiry &s;till remains, why then are &s;in|ners commanded to labour for the meat which en|dureth to everla&s;ting life? Of what benefit can their endeavours be to them with regard to their eternal intere&s;t? I mu&s;t therefore attempt a more direct and po&s;itive an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>AND in general, our ob&s;ervance of the&s;e duties is required as the ordinary method and means, where|by God is plea&s;ed to prepare a &s;inner for, and then communicate to him that &s;aving grace, light and life, whereby he becomes a new creature, and is enabled and di&s;po&s;ed unto the&s;e exerci&s;es and acts which are &s;piritually good, and with which, accord|ing to the go&s;pel promi&s;es, eternal life is connected. And accordingly a &s;inner ought to attend to them as the way or means in which God has required and encouraged him to &s;eek an intere&s;t in the&s;e benefits and ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>BUT it will be proper to examine this matter more clo&s;ely and particularly. I &s;hall therefore con|&s;ider fir&s;t, why God requires &s;inners to labour for
<PB N="47" REF="010643_0046_0F81BDD44B015E18">
the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life. Second|ly, why &s;inners are to ob&s;erve and do what is thus required of them. The&s;e are quite different con&s;ide|rations, &amp; mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed accordingly. The former re&s;pects God's end in commanding, the lat|ter our end in obeying. The one will lead us to enquire into the rea&s;ons and de&s;igns of infinite wi&s;|dom in giving the&s;e precepts to men; the other will give us occa&s;ion to examine the motives and views upon which men are per&s;uaded and influenced to practi&s;e the duties therein pre&s;cribed. God's ends in commanding are mo&s;t wi&s;e, holy and good; but unregenerate &s;inners are morally incapable of obey|ing for holy ends, till they are endowed with new and &s;upernatural principles. By following out and carrying in mind this di&s;tinction between God's end in requiring, and our end in performing the duties, we are treating of, we may be able to an&s;wer our pre&s;ent enquiry di&s;tinctly. Whence it will appear, that as it is agreable to the divine perfections to re|quire the&s;e duties of &s;inners, &s;o the ob&s;ervance of them may and ought to be inculcated upon all the hearers of the go&s;pel, and that from &s;uch motives as are &s;uited to reach their con&s;ciences, and influence their practice.</P>
<P>FIRST, What are tho&s;e ends for which God has required &s;inners to labour, in a diligent u&s;e of pre|&s;cribed means, for the meat which endureth to ever|la&s;ting life? I an&s;wer, that in &s;ubordination to his own glory, God has a twofold end in pre&s;cribing the&s;e duties to men. His primary de&s;ign herein is that he may glorify the riches of his goodne&s;s and mercy, in calling and recovering &s;inners from the corruption and mi&s;ery of their fallen &s;tate, to a par|ticipation of tho&s;e benefits, which Chri&s;t has pur|cha&s;ed
<PB N="48" REF="010643_0047_0F81BDD522C8FBC8">
for the ve&s;&s;els of mercy. Or in the Apo&s;tle's words, "that they may be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth." And in ca&s;e men neglect or refu&s;e to attend to the&s;e pre&s;cribed means, and &s;o fail of obtaining that grace and &s;alvation which is propo&s;ed to them, to be by them &s;ought in this way, then it is God's de&s;ign, that they being left without excu&s;e, having no cloak for their &s;in, his ju&s;tice may be glorified in their condemnation.</P>
<P>AS human endeavours are the appointed means by which God gives and we obtain the meat that peri&s;heth, &s;o human endeavours are al&s;o the appoint|ed means in and by which God be&s;tows and we re|ceive the gift of eternal life. And he has com|manded &s;inners to read and hear, and meditate on his word, to implore his mercy, to avoid wilful &s;ins, and temptations thereunto, becau&s;e it is his will that they &s;hould be awakened to con&s;ideration, convinced of their mi&s;erable &s;tate by &s;in, taken off from fal&s;e confidences, and, de&s;pairing of help in them&s;elves, attend to, believe, and acquie&s;ce joyfully in, the re|velation or propo&s;al of mercy in the go&s;pel, thro' the obedience and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and be &s;ancti|fied thro' the truth and Holy Spirit. And it is God's will to awaken and humble them, to work faith and holine&s;s in them, in the way of their at|tendance to the&s;e pre&s;cribed duties. The&s;e are, by the appointment and ble&s;&s;ing of God, means where|by the work of conver&s;ion is effected. They are accordingly made u&s;e of by him in fulfilling the good plea&s;ure of his goodne&s;s. And he has commanded and encouraged men to u&s;e the&s;e means, becau&s;e he has de&s;igned that his commands &amp; encouragements &s;hould influence and per&s;uade them &s;o to do, that they may hereby receive that benefit, and his grace
<PB N="49" REF="010643_0048_0F81BDD5C9E4DE10">
that glory, which is ultimately aimed at in and by them. And if &s;inners &s;et at nought the&s;e coun&s;els and commands, &s;till his word &s;hall accompli&s;h his plea&s;ure, and not return to him void. The mouth of the impenitent &s;hall hereby be &s;topped; they &s;hall be left without excu&s;e; and God &s;hall be ju&s;ti|fied when he &s;peaketh, and clear when he judgeth.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be further enquired, why God is plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe and u&s;e the&s;e means in effectu|ating his holy and gracious purpo&s;es? It may be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, becau&s;e thus it has &s;eemed good in his &s;ight. If it &s;hall appear (as I tru&s;t it will in its proper place) that this is in fact God's or|dinary method in the di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings, we ought to be &s;atisfied, tho' we &s;hould not be able to enter into the rea&s;ons of the divine appointment herein. But be&s;ides, there are &s;everal con&s;iderations which may lead us to conclude, that it was wi&s;e and fit that God &s;hould have an e&s;tabli&s;hed method of working in the kingdom of grace, as well as nature: That he &s;hould make u&s;e of means in the conver&s;ion, as well as pre&s;ervation of men: And that this method which he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the&s;e means which he makes u&s;e of are wi&s;ely cho&s;en, being well adapted to &s;ub&s;erve the de&s;igns of his mercy. As there is a beauty and wi&s;dom apparent in that regular &s;ubordination of cau&s;es and effects which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the natural world, &s;o the &s;ame appears in a higher degree in that connection and dependance of antecedents and con&s;equents, means and ends, which is con&s;tituted in the government of the intelligent and moral world. And this me|thod of dealing with and working upon mankind; which we plead for, appears to be well &s;uited to the
<PB N="50" REF="010643_0049_0F81BDD6941791E8">
nature of rational and active beings; and will &s;erve to di&s;play abundantly not only the grace of God in the &s;alvation of his elect, but al&s;o his ju&s;tice in the condemnation of impenitent &s;inners, &s;ug|ge&s;ting an ea&s;y account of that increa&s;e of guilt and puni&s;hment, which they will in the coming world be the &s;ubjects of, who reject the offers of &s;alvation in the go&s;pel. But to enquire into the&s;e things is be&s;ide our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. If it &s;hall appear that this is the method in which the bene|fits of redemption are applied or conveyed to man|kind, we ought to be &s;atisfied, without di&s;puting the fitne&s;s of God's appointments.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now, in the &s;econd place, con&s;ider for what ends &s;inners are to attend to the&s;e pre|&s;cribed means.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is granted that men ought always to act for holy ends, from that love which is the prime effect of a &s;piritual view of divine glory di&s;|played in the go&s;pel; ina&s;much as the want here|of is owing to a criminal blindne&s;s; yet tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that this an&s;wer does not &s;atisfy our pre|&s;ent enquiry. For &s;ince the unregenerate are un|der the power of this blindne&s;s, they are plainly in a moral incapacity of acting for holy ends, till the eyes of their under&s;tanding are &s;avingly enlight|ned. If then no kind or manner of acting be re|quired or encouraged at all in the word of God, but what nece&s;&s;arily includes or pre&s;uppo&s;es faith and regeneration, then all enquiries about com|mands and encouragements to duty, as means of obtaining faith, or the grace of regeneration, are plainly at an end. A &s;uppo&s;ition which the &s;crip|tures will not allow. Wherefore, that I may
<PB N="51" REF="010643_0050_0F81BDD80EEF5958">
give as clear an an&s;wer to this enquiry as I can, I would ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) No man may do any acts of religious obe|dience, for &s;uch ends as are &s;imply and ab&s;olute|ly unlawful. Such &s;acrifices are in a peculiar &s;en&s;e an abomination to the Lord; and will high|ly provoke his wrath and jealou&s;y again&s;t &s;uch as pre&s;ume to offer them. This was what rendred the long prayers of the Phari&s;ees &s;o odious in God's &s;ight, that they u&s;ed and de&s;igned them as a cloak to their unmerciful and unrighteous practices, <HI>in devouring widows hou&s;es,</HI> and <HI>neglecting the weightier points of the law.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) THOUGH men unregenerate are morally incapable of obeying any divine precept for holy ends, they are yet capable of acting from a re|gard to &s;uch ends as, however deficient, are not &s;imply unlawful, but in their place and kind are good and worthy to be regarded. They may have &s;o much knowledge of God, and his will, and their obligations to obedience, as to be influ|enced hereby to do many things good in them|&s;elves, and commanded by God. They may for in&s;tance be per&s;uaded that an attendance to the pre&s;cribed means of grace is their wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e, in order to obtain further light and in&s;truction, that &s;o they may e&s;cape the wrath and cur&s;e of God, and obtain that happine&s;s which nature prompts all men to &s;eek for. A regard to their own future and eternal intere&s;t, may influence them to an ob&s;ervance of the&s;e duties, and &s;o keep them waiting upon God in the appointed ways, in which he is plea&s;ed to grant his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="010643_0051_0F81BDD8C66E5108">NOW though there be an e&s;&s;ential defect in the obedience of the unregenerate, with re&s;pect to the ends of their actions, &s;o that they cannot be de|nominated holy, yet we cannot &s;ay, that it is &s;im|ply unlawful for men to have a regard to their own happine&s;s, and endeavour to e&s;cape tho&s;e e|vils with which they are threatned. It is not un|lawful for men to act agreable to the pre&s;ent light and conviction of their mind concerning their duty and intere&s;t, though their minds be not &s;av|ingly enlightned; yea it is undoubtedly the duty of every one to do &s;o. The natural con&s;cience of man bears witne&s;s to the obligation he is under to obey the commands of God. When therefore the mind of a &s;inner is &s;o far enlightned, as that he is per&s;uaded, and convinced that God has command|ed him to attend to the ordinary means of in|&s;truction and conver&s;ion, though he may not have a ju&s;t conception of the nature, and divine excel|lency of that change of heart, which the&s;e means are de&s;igned to effect, thro' the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and influence of the good Spirit, certainly it is lawful, yea it is his duty, to act from a regard to &s;uch a conviction and per&s;ua&s;ion. When the di|vine call in the word has reached his ears, and the truth therein revealed has found acce&s;s to his con|&s;cience, &s;o far as to produce a conviction that the go&s;pel is a divine revelation of mercy to mankind, tis certainly lawful, yea an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, that he attend to it; though he may have no &s;piritual apprehen&s;ion of the nature of the ble&s;&s;ings there|in propo&s;ed, or the way in which men come to the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>TRUE holine&s;s implies a regard to higher and nobler ends, than any which an unregenerate man
<PB N="53" REF="010643_0052_0F81BDDDACC66700">
aims at; but it does not exclude a regard to in|ferior ends in a due &s;ubordination: Which &s;hews, clearly that it is not &s;imply unlawful to have re|&s;pect to inferior ends in our actions. Such ends are in their place right and good. To in&s;tance in &s;elf-love. Tis not &s;imply unlawful for a man to &s;eek his own happine&s;s: Yea tis fit and right that he should do &s;o. But if he aims at nothing more than to &s;ecure his own private intere&s;t, tho' he may u&s;e no unlawful means, there is nothing of holine&s;s or true virtue in his conduct; yea it is &s;infully deficient in re&s;pect of the end. But the fault does not con&s;i&s;t in his acting for an un|lawful end, but in neglecting tho&s;e ends which ought to have been regarded. The go&s;pel pro|po&s;es rewards and puni&s;hments as motives to o|bedience, which are directly &s;uited and de&s;igned by God, to work upon the natural principle of &s;elf-love; whence tis evident that our own hap|pine&s;s may and ought to be regarded by us, in the highe&s;t acts of holy obedience. Yea God has enforced his precepts by much lower motives, e|ven temporal promi&s;es and threatnings; and that not only to Jew, but Chri&s;tians. Says the Apo|&s;tle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.6.</NOTE> <HI>Godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the life that now is.</HI> And again,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 6.2.3.</NOTE> <HI>Honour thy father and mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou maye&s;t live long upon the earth.</HI> Says another,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 3.10&mdash;13.</NOTE> <HI>For he that will love life, and &s;ee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they &s;peak no guile; let him e&s;chew evil and do good; let him &s;eek peace and en&s;ue it. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers, but the face of the Lord is again&s;t them that

do evil. And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?</HI> If there be any pertinency and force in the&s;e arguments and mo|tives to chri&s;tian duties, then it is not un&s;uitable for chri&s;tians to have re&s;pect to temporal ble&s;&s;ings, in their obedience to the laws of Chri&s;t. Indeed the&s;e things are not the highe&s;t end we are to act for; but this is doubtle&s;s a lawful end, yea a good end in its place. In &s;hort, if what men aim at be lawful &amp; good in it&s;elf, whether of a higher or lower kind, they then act for a lawful and good end, though through a &s;inful defect, their actions may be unholy. To proceed&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">(3.) DUTIES performed in &s;uch a manner, and for &s;uch ends as the unregenerate are capable of, are preferable to a total omi&s;&s;ion and wilful neg|lect of them. That men ob&s;erve the matter of God's commands from natural principles, from common light, grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for infe|rior ends, is better than not to do it at all. Such actions are as to their matter and &s;ub&s;tance (as Divines &s;peak) agreable to the command of God, therefore good; but the neglect is contrary to the divine precept, therefore &s;imply evil, every way wrong, having no goodne&s;s belonging to it. And as to the end which &s;inners have regard to in the performance of commanded duties, from which actions take their form, this is indeed de|fective, and &s;o unholy. Yet the end of &s;uch actions is not &s;o oppo&s;ite to true holine&s;s, as the end of neglecting &amp; de&s;pi&s;ing the matter of God's commands. It di&s;covers extreme malignity and contempt of God, when men wilfully act in op|po&s;ition to the pre&s;ent light of their minds, and convictions of con&s;cience. Moreover, actions
<PB N="55" REF="010643_0054_0F81BDDED44A0010">
good in them&s;elves, tho' defective in their end, are better in their tendency &amp; effects, than tho&s;e acti|ons which are every way evil. God and his laws are not thereby &s;o much di&s;honoured. There is le&s;s abu&s;e, and outrageous violence done to our rational and moral faculties, our rea&s;on and con|&s;cience. The Holy Spirit is not &s;o de&s;pitefully re&s;i&s;ted. There is not &s;o much mi&s;chief done to our fellow creatures.

<P>IT appears then, that although the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate are not holy, yet there is in them &s;omething really good, right and commen|dable in its kind and place,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>As there are good actions which have &s;in adhering to them, &s;o there are &s;ins which have good in them.

be owned that one thing is wanting, yet we mu&s;t &s;ay al&s;o, that there is in them le&s;s evil and more good, than in a total, wilful and malicious neglect of them.</P>
<P>IT is the duty of the unregenerate to ob&s;erve and practice the duties, which God has in his word enjoined on them, from &s;uch principles, and for &s;uch ends as have been mentioned, rather than not at all. This is a plain inference from what has been before ob&s;erved. The divine command binds upon us both the matter and end of the duties it pre&s;cribes. However then the end and manner of action in the unregenerate be defect|ive, they are undoubtedly bound to perform the matter of the duty required of them. The per|formance of commanded duties is good in it&s;elf, and as &s;uch is bound upon all men, con&s;idered ab|&s;tractly from the manner and end of the perfor|mance. We ought indeed to act for holy ends, but we ought to do what God has commanded for inferior and defective ends, provided they are not in their own nature &s;imply unlawful, rather than not do it at all. To neglect doing any thing that God has commanded, or to do what he has forbidden, is in it&s;elf evil. Whoever then does
<PB N="58" REF="010643_0057_0F81BDE108958A50">
what is materially good, and commanded by God, therein does as he ought to do: That is, he does his duty &s;o far, he avoids &s;in; for if he had done contrary, he had done what is directly forbidden, and &s;inful. Nor does this imply that it is a man's duty of two &s;ins to chu&s;e the lea&s;t. He ought in &s;uch a ca&s;e to chu&s;e neither. But he ought to do what is good, tho' in a defective unholy manner, rather than do what is every way &s;inful.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, we may give a di&s;tinct an&s;wer to our pre&s;ent enquiry, viz. why, or for what rea&s;ons or ends are &s;inners to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life, in a dili|gent attendance to the pre&s;cribed means of grace before declared. They ought to repent and be|lieve the go&s;pel, and obey all the precepts there|in contained, from a true faith in God, and in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t the redeemer, from a holy reve|rence, love &amp; gratitude, for the maje&s;ty and grace di&s;played in the work of redemption. But they are morally incapable of acting from &s;uch views and ends as the&s;e, till they have a &s;piritual know|ledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; yet they are capable of performing the matter of the duties required, from lower views, from natural principles, and a different kind of light and influence from the Holy Spirit. And it is their duty, and they have encouragement to do what God has required of them, in &s;uch a manner and for &s;uch ends as the&s;e, however defect|ive, rather than not at all. Till their hearts are divinely renewed, and their minds &s;avingly en|lightned, they are to attend upon the in&s;tituted means of grace, from a conviction of conscience that God has commanded them to do &s;o, and it
<PB N="59" REF="010643_0058_0F81BDE2124E4780">
is their duty to obey. They are to do it from a de&s;ire of further light and in&s;truction, which God has directed them to &s;eek for in this way. They are to do it from a &s;erious concern, if it may be, to find re&s;t to their weary &s;ouls, to flee from the wrath to come, &amp; obtain reconciliation with God.</P>
<P>AND if the foregoing conclu&s;ions are ju&s;t, we may infer, that &s;inners, however incapable of act|ing in a holy manner, are to be exhorted to the duties pre&s;cribed to them in the word of God. The&s;e things are to be inforced upon their con|&s;ciences by the authority of God; by the terrors of his wrath again&s;t pre&s;umptuous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; the riches of his grace, and the excellency of the ble&s;&s;ings revealed in the go&s;pel. All the encou|ragements which the &s;cripture holds forth to tho&s;e who wait upon God in his appointed ways, and the danger of re&s;i&s;ting the Holy Gho&s;t, and hard|ning the heart again&s;t conviction mu&s;t be declar|ed. We mu&s;t bear witne&s;s to the truth revealed in the go&s;pel, concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his cha|racter and work, his power, merits and grace, appearing in what he has done, and &s;aid, and in his name be&s;eech you to be reconciled to God. In brief, we mu&s;t addre&s;s their rea&s;on and con|&s;cience, their hopes and fears, with all tho&s;e po|werful motives, whereby the precepts of the go&s;pel come recommended and enforced.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked, to what purpo&s;e it is to exhort and pre&s;s men to acts of religious obedience, while they are incapable of complying in a holy manner? I an&s;wer, that if God has required the&s;e things, for &s;uch ends as have been declared, then chri&s;tians mu&s;t inculcate the practice of the&s;e du|ties on all who hear the call of the go&s;pel, notwith|&s;tanding their moral impotency to do any thing
<PB N="60" REF="010643_0059_0F81BDE295A14310">
that is &s;piritually good. For it is the will and command of God that his precepts be inculcated on tho&s;e to whom they are given, whether they have a pre&s;ent power to obey in a right manner or not. If he has required and encouraged his &s;inful crea|tures thus to wait upon him for his mercy, they ought certainly to be exhorted &s;o to do. I &s;ay not that they are to be exhorted to perform duties in a &s;in|ful manner, but however they ought to do them in &s;uch a manner as they can; and not indulge them|&s;elves in a neglect of what God has commanded, tho' they are morally unable to obey as they ought. There is encouragement (as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter) for &s;inners to &s;eek &s;alvation by attending tho&s;e means which God has pre&s;cribed. And this is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why preachers &s;hould direct and exhort them to &s;uch a conduct, and lay before them all the encouraging and quickning motives that their ca&s;e admits of.</P>
<P>NOR have they any rea&s;on to conclude that their labour will be in vain. Such exhortations may have a happy effect, nothwith&s;tanding the moral im|potency of tho&s;e to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed. For, Fir&s;t, it will not be denyed, that &s;inners may hereby be per&s;uaded to ob&s;erve the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of God's commands, from tho&s;e principles before &s;poken of. So much as this may be effected in men unregenerate by moral &s;ua&s;ion alone. And &s;uch a performance of duties as this is much better than a total neglect and contempt of them. Here|by men are re&s;trained from &s;uch cour&s;es of pre|&s;umptuous wickedne&s;s, as not only inhance their guilt, but induce and &s;trengthen vicious habits, &s;ear the con&s;cience, quench the Spirit, and &s;o render their conver&s;ion in a manner hopele&s;s. And by

attending the&s;e duties, &s;inners are kept in the ordi|nary way of God's ble&s;&s;ing; but by neglecting them, they put far away the ordinary means of conver&s;ion, But be&s;ides the&s;e advantages which were mentioned before, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that in and by tho&s;e calls and exhortations to duty, which are addre&s;&s;ed to men in the mini&s;try of the word, God is plea&s;ed to communicate that grace and in|fluence of his good Spirit, whereby &s;inners are en|abled and per&s;uaded to believe and repent, and turn to God through Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>There is a double end in pre&s;&s;ing on men the ob|&s;ervance of duties with the &s;uppo&s;ition of the &s;tate of impotency.

By attendance to them, they are pre&s;erved from many &s;ins. (2.) In an e&s;pecial manner from the great &s;in of de&s;pi&s;ing God, which ends commonly in that which is un|pardonable. (3.)

However un|able men may be to perform aright the duties to
<PB N="62" REF="010643_0061_0F81BDE406401518">
which they are exhorted, chri&s;tians have yet en|couragement to inculcate the&s;e duties on all the hearers of the go&s;pel; and the&s;e have al&s;o great encouragement to attend &s;eriou&s;ly, and endeavour to obey &s;uch calls and exhortations to duty, &s;ince the &s;alutary influences of the good Spirit of grace and truth are ordinarily communicated by this medium.</P>
<P>NOW of the things which have been &s;poken, this is the &s;um. God has holy and gracious ends in commanding and encouraging unregenerate per&s;ons, as well as others, to attend diligently the outward means, wherein the &s;aving know|ledge of the truth is conveyed, and the benefits of redemption applied to the &s;ouls of his people. The&s;e commands and encouragements are given to &s;inners, that they might hereby be per&s;uaded to wait upon him for his mercy, in this way which infinite wi&s;dom has appointed; that &s;o God may glorify the riches of his free grace, in their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>AND though it mu&s;t be owned, that &s;inners are incapable of acting for holy ends, yet they are capable of acting from a regard to &s;uch ends as are &s;o far right and good, that they may and ought to be exhorted and encouraged to perform duties in &s;uch a manner, rather than not at all. Such performances are preferable to a total neg|lect of God's commands. Notwith&s;tanding what is ami&s;s or defective, they may be, and ordinarily are a means of good to men, both in this world, and the world to come. It is not becau&s;e men perform the&s;e duties in a right manner, and with a holy intention, that they have &s;o de&s;irable an i&s;&s;ue, but becau&s;e this is the way in which God
<PB N="63" REF="010643_0062_0F81BDE79F789C30">
has thought fit to fulfil the good plea&s;ure of his goodne&s;s, and carry into execution the purpo&s;es of his grace towards the &s;ons of men. God's de&s;igns in giving the&s;e commands are indeed different from theirs in obeying them. They are by a &s;ecret influence led in a way that they know not, and find them&s;elves at la&s;t conducted whither at their fir&s;t &s;etting out they thought not of arriving. In the progre&s;s of their endea|vours they find their apprehen&s;ions and views much altered from what they were in the begin|ning. When the light of the glorious go&s;pel &s;hines with a transforming power into their hearts, it di&s;covers to them their former darkne&s;s and mi&s;takes. The charm is now di&s;&s;olved (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) whereby &s;atan held them under his dominion. Tho&s;e fal&s;e appear|ances with which they were deluded, vani&s;h a|way: And they &s;ee that they have been walking upon inchanted ground. They are then ready to acknowledge, that however this ble&s;&s;ed change may have been effected in the way of means, it is God who worketh all in all: Who hath called them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, and tran&s;lated them from the kingdom of &s;atan, into the kingdom of his dear &s;on.</P>
<P>HAVING thus largely explained the &s;ubject, and &s;tated &s;everal preliminary points, which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to be enquired into in order to prepare the way for what is propo&s;ed to be mainly in&s;i&s;ted on, I &s;hall in the next place enter upon the direct proof and vindication of our doctrine, which &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome following di&s;cour&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON III. That the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of &s;ome Sinners, is more probable than of others.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now time that we proceed to the fourth general head, which was to prove that unrege|nerate men are bound and encouraged to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life. As this is the main point I undertook to defend, and the pertinency and practical u&s;e of what has hitherto been offered depends upon the truth of it, I pro|po&s;e to examine this matter &s;omething largely.</P>
<P>I JOIN obligation and encouragement together; for I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon no arguments, but &s;uch as in|clude and carry encouragement, as well as obliga|tion to obedience. To pre&s;s duties upon &s;inners only with legal rea&s;ons, and for legal ends, that they may hereby work out a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s by which they may be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God, will have no tendency to excite their endeavours to comply with them, but only fill them with tor|menting
<PB N="65" REF="010643_0064_0F81BDE885FA9038">
di&s;quietments. Such rea&s;ons will only prove rea&s;ons of de&s;pair, to him who knows that he has already &s;inned, and that it is ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;o comply with the com|mand, as to obtain ju&s;tification and eternal life by the deeds of the law. Tis not &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to &s;hew that men ought to per|form the&s;e duties, unle&s;s we can propo&s;e &s;ome de|&s;irable end which may be attained by &s;uch a per|formance of them as they are capable of; that &s;o they may be induced thereunto by the hope and pro&s;pect of obtaining it.</P>
<P>THIS being premi&s;ed, in order to a right under|&s;tanding of the true &s;tate of the que&s;tion, I &s;hall proceed to the proof of the doctrine propo&s;ed to be defended.</P>
<P>AND the fir&s;t argument &s;hall be taken from the probability and hope there is that they who &s;eek &s;alvation in the way of attendance to the duties before &s;poken of &s;hall obtain it, and the danger that they will peri&s;h in their &s;in who neglect them. If they are mo&s;t likely to obtain eternal life who thus &s;trive for it, and they are in greate&s;t: danger of everla&s;ting perdition who will not in this way endeavour to e&s;cape it, then it is the duty and wi&s;|dom of all, to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life, and &s;trive earne&s;tly to flee from the wrath to come. Every one who apprehends that there is any hope or po&s;&s;ibility that he may be &s;aved, and that any thing which he is able to do will tend either to promote or hinder his &s;alvation, is bound and encouraged to &s;uch a conduct as will have the mo&s;t hopeful a&s;pect on his final happine&s;s. This I think no man will or can deny. All there|fore that is nece&s;&s;ary to be proved in this place is,
<PB N="66" REF="010643_0065_0F81BDE962D5E090">
that &s;uch as attend the common means of grace and &s;alvation, have a probability of obtaining it; and they who refu&s;e &s;o to do, are in peculiar hazard of peri&s;hing in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to the proof of this pro|po&s;ition, I would offer one word by way of expla|nation. That when we &s;peak of probability in any ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood only in reference to the judgment which men make concerning things; or the view in which things are pre&s;ented to, and ap|prehended by the human mind. There is no pro|bability with God. He beholds every thing as it is, with a certain and intuitive view. He knows per|fectly all things that ever have been, are, or will be through the immea&s;urable ages of an endle&s;s dura|tion. Tis not at all uncertain with him who will have everla&s;ting life. But we can judge of things only from &s;uch degrees of evidence as our limited and feeble faculties can di&s;cern, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es is too &s;mall to &s;upport a certain and infallible con|clu&s;ion. This lower degree of evidence is called probability. When therefore we &s;ay there is a pro|bability that &s;uch as diligently &s;eek &s;alvation in the u&s;e of pre&s;cribed means &s;hall obtain it, and that they who do not &s;hall fail of it, the meaning is, that the&s;e things commonly go together; that God oftener extends his &s;aving mercy to tho&s;e who thus wait upon him, than to tho&s;e who neglect &s;o to do. And therefore that there is more ground to hope com|fortably in one ca&s;e, than in the other. What the degree of probability is, is another que&s;tion, which we may perhaps be better able to judge of when we come to the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument. The propo&s;ition before us will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be &s;ufficiently proved, if it &s;hall be made to appear&mdash;</P>

<P N="1">I. SOME who are not in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, are more likely to arrive at it than others.

<P>WE are expre&s;ly taught by our Saviour's words to the Scribe,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 12.34.</NOTE> that a man who is not yet a &s;ubject of his &s;piritual kingdom, may be not far from it. "When Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly, he &s;aid to him, thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Which words mo&s;t naturally carry this meaning, that he had ju&s;ter notions of religion; and the &s;tate of his mind was &s;uch, that it was more
<PB N="68" REF="010643_0067_0F81BDEAD3D0F7B0">
likely according to human rules of probability, that he &s;hould attain to a true under&s;tanding and belief of the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and &s;o become his di&s;ciple, than the other Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who&s;e religious &s;entiments were &s;o corrupt, their prejudi|ces again&s;t Chri&s;t: and his doctrine &s;o &s;trong and rooted, and who oppo&s;ed the cleare&s;t evidences of his divine mi&s;&s;ion with mo&s;t unrea&s;onable perver&s;e|ne&s;s, and bla&s;phemous malice. I think that nothing but a &s;trong attachment to prejudicate notions would incline any one to accommodate an oppo&s;ite inter|pretation to &s;o plain an expre&s;&s;ion. But yet our Saviour's words carry a &s;trong intimation that this &s;cribe was not at that time a true believer in him. We have here then an example of one who, by the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t, was comparatively near to the kingdom of God; one who though not &s;avingly converted to the faith of Chri&s;t, had made an ad|vance towards it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Some may be in a greater forwardne&s;s and prepara|tion for the work it&s;elf [of regeneration] and there|by in a greater nearne&s;s to the &s;tate of it than o|thers.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Owen,</HI> ibid. pag. 179.</BIBL></P>

who are left in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death. If the Jew had the advantage of the Gentile much every way, becau&s;e they were favoured with peculiar religious privileges, and chiefly becau&s;e un|to them were committed the oracles of God; cer|tainly the advantage of having the divine oracles is greater now, ina&s;much as the light and in&s;truction they are fitted to diffu&s;e, is much clearer than the Jews enjoyed. But why is this to be accounted a privi|lege? Is it not plainly becau&s;e they who enjoy the&s;e outward means are more likely than others to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth? Where God is plea&s;ed in his providence to &s;end and &s;et up the light of the go&s;pel, we have good grounds to conclude, that he has de&s;igned that it &s;hall be effectual to the conver&s;ion &amp; &s;alvation of &s;ome who hear it. Accordingly the apo&s;tle Paul was encou|raged to preach the go&s;pel at Corinth boldly, be|cau&s;e he was a&s;&s;ured by the Lord, that he had much people in that city. Can any one, who con&s;iders the matter with attention, really believe, that the mo&s;t ignorant pagan is as near the kingdom of God, and as likely to under&s;tand &amp; believe the truth &s;avingly, as that &s;inner to whom God has &s;ent the word of &s;alvation, and who&s;e attention to it is &s;o much a|wakened, that he &s;tudies it diligently, and with a great concern about his &s;oul's &s;alvation, though he is not yet a true believer?

<P N="2">2. I PROCEED now in the next place, to con&s;ider, as was propo&s;ed, what it is that renders, or mani|fe&s;ts the condition of one &s;inner more hopeful than that of another. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we examine this matter carefully, and have clear and determi|nate conceptions of it, in order to judge whether human endeavours have here any place and u&s;e, and if they have, in what re&s;pect, and how far they are u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IN general, whatever it be that renders the ca&s;e of mankind more or le&s;s hopeful, 'tis &s;omething that lies open to human ob&s;ervation, either immediately, or by means of its effects or concomitants. For it is to be remembred, that probability re&s;pects the views and judgments of men, and not the know|ledge or decrees of God. When therefore the &s;crip|tures &s;peak of events as more or le&s;s probable, it is nece&s;&s;arily implied, that there is in the ca&s;e &s;uch evi|dence pre&s;ented to the human mind, as a &s;ufficient ground of a probable judgment. There is then in the ca&s;e and condition of &s;ome who are not yet in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, that which may pro|perly be regarded as a favourable &s;ymptom, indi|cating that there is more probability that they will attain to a &s;aving conver&s;ion, than many others. There is a vi&s;ible ground for a comfortable hope con|cerning them. If it be now enquired what that is, I an&s;wer, it is a work of the Holy Spirit preparatory
<PB N="76" REF="010643_0075_0F81BDF259A02670">
to conver&s;ion. This therefore is now, by the light of &s;cripture, to be enquired into. Accordingly I &s;hall endeavour&mdash;Fir&s;t, <HI>To declare and open the nature and properties of it.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Prove the truth and reality of it.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the nature of this preparatory work which is now to be treated of, it may be noted, that taken in its full extent, it comprehends whatever is done for us, wrought in us, or performed by us, that has any kind or degree of &s;ub&s;erviency to our conver|&s;ion or regeneration. But that we may have a more di&s;tinct view of it, I &s;hall con&s;ider it, fir&s;t, as it is more general; &s;econdly, as it is more &s;pecial.</P>
<P>FIRST, <HI>There is a general work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to conver&s;ion.</HI> Indeed the eternal love of God the Father, the purpo&s;es of his grace towards man, his providing a mediator, and commi&s;&s;ionating him to his part of the work of redemption, as al&s;o the whole work of Chri&s;t, in obeying the precepts, and bearing the cur&s;e of the law, may properly e|nough be &s;aid to be preparatory to the work of re|generation or conver&s;ion. But I &s;hall here con&s;ider that work which is e&s;pecially a&s;cribed to the Holy Spirit, and which belongs to the application of the redemption, ordained by God the Father, and pur|cha&s;ed by the Son. This general preparatory work of the Holy Spirit con&s;i&s;ts in giving a revelation of God's gracious and merciful de&s;igns towards fallen man, and the way in which he has purpo&s;ed to carry the&s;e de&s;igns into execution, through the mediation of Chri&s;t; that the Mediator by his obedience and &s;ufferings has wrought out a righteou&s;ne&s;s, and made an atonement for &s;in, in which God is well plea&s;ed; and in con&s;ideration of which, who&s;oever believeth &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. This re|velation
<PB N="77" REF="010643_0076_0F81BDF3105F5478">
is contained in the go&s;pel, which was given by in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, and confirmed by miracles wrought by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t, thro' the in&s;trumentality of tho&s;e who were fir&s;t cho&s;en to bear witne&s;s to the truth. And ever &s;ince there have been witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame rai&s;ed up from time to time, who have been furni&s;hed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to publi&s;h the glad tidings of &s;alvation to men, and proclaim the&s;e general pro|po&s;als of mercy and grace to all and upon all that believe, without di&s;tinction, &amp; &s;o call &s;inners to faith and repentance. Now this is in its natural tendency, and by the appointment of God, preparatory, and &s;ub&s;ervient to the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of men, and carries an encouraging a&s;pect towards every one.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this, there is, &s;econdly, <HI>a more &s;pecial preparation for faith and conver&s;ion, which &s;ome are the &s;ubjects of in di&s;tinction from others;</HI> in re&s;pect of which the ca&s;e of &s;ome is more hopeful, and their &s;alvation more probable in various degrees. This is what our pre&s;ent de&s;ign requires to be carefully explained. And that may be able to take a di&s;tinct and orderly view hereof, I &s;hall endeavour to repre&s;ent this preparatory work of the Holy Spirit in its gradual progre&s;s, according as the connection and &s;ubordination of cau&s;es and effects, means and ends, will most naturally direct. In the first place, <HI>the &s;ending of the Go&s;pel-call to &s;ome in di&s;tinction from others, belongs to this work of the Holy Spirit, which is preparatory to conver&s;ion.</HI> Notwith&s;tand|ing the general declarations of grace to &s;inners thro' Chri&s;t, there are many who hear not the report of the go&s;pel. Such are not in &s;o near a capacity of obtaining faith, as they who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the outward call of the go&s;pel, nor is it &s;o likely
<PB N="78" REF="010643_0077_0F81BDF3D795D398">
that they will come to the knowledge of the truth. When God in his providence favours a per&s;on or people with the outward means of chri&s;tian know|ledge, there is more rea&s;on to hope that they will believe and be &s;aved, than that others will, who have not the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, <HI>It is al&s;o the work of the Holy Spirit to awaken the attention of men to the outward call of the go&s;pel.</HI> There are many who hear words of eternal life, as though they heard them not. They are &s;o carele&s;s and thoughtle&s;s, their minds are &s;o filled with vanity, with worldly pro&s;pects or con|trivances, that they do not mind nor attend to the import and weight of the words that are &s;ounding in their ears. But the good Spirit &s;o awakens the attention of &s;ome, that they li&s;ten greedily to what they hear. The truths which are declared &s;ink into their ears. This is a further degree of that prepa|ratory work of the Holy Spirit, which we are now enquiring into. And they who are enabled and influenced to give attention to the revelation of grace and truth in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the word, are more likely to under&s;tand and believe it, than they, who, while the call of the go&s;pel is &s;ounding in their ears, have their minds and thoughts occupied with cares or amu&s;ements foreign to the &s;erious import of what they hear.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, <HI>Another effect of the Spirit's agency preparatory to conver&s;ion is, the illumination of the mind by a common doctrinal under&s;tanding and belief of the truth.</HI> This is what men are capable of pre|vious to regeneration. They may in &s;ome mea&s;ure apprehend the import, and perceive the evidence of the chri&s;tian doctrine. I grant that the&s;e things appear in a new light, to tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tanding
<PB N="79" REF="010643_0078_0F81BDF487EDF3F8">
is &s;o enlightned, as to di&s;cern &s;piritual things in a &s;piritual manner. But it is certain that men un|regenerate may &amp; often do under&s;tand the mean|ing and are convinced of the truth, of many of the doctrines of the go&s;pel. And therefore &s;uch are in &s;cripture &s;aid to be enlightned, to believe, to receive the knowledge of the truth, and to know the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Holy Spirit not only makes them attentive to the outward call of the go&s;pel, but al&s;o conveys into their mind by means hereof &s;ome knowledge of divine things. They are enabled to take in a true idea of what is objectively revealed, and are al&s;o per&s;uaded on good grounds that it is true. This common il|lumination admits of very different degrees, both in re&s;pect of the objects or truths hereby di&s;cover|ed to the mind, and al&s;o in re&s;pect of the clear|ne&s;s of evidence by which they are di&s;covered. And hence &s;ome have a much more exten&s;ive un|der&s;tanding of the great doctrines of revelation than others have, &amp; their a&s;&s;ent is &s;tronger. Some have only a weak and wavering per&s;ua&s;ion that the go&s;pel may perhaps be true: Others are fully &s;atisfied of it. The minds of men may be much enlightned, without any &s;aving renovation of the heart: Yet this common illumination is ordinarily &s;ubordinate to, and preparative for that &s;pecial and effectual work, whereby we are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For by this means &s;inners are kept in the ordinary way of God's ble&s;&s;ing, pre|&s;erved from many dangerous &s;nares, and their at|tention is kept up to tho&s;e outward means, where|by the &s;aving knowledge of the truth is convey|ed to the minds and hearts of the children of men.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="010643_0079_0F81BDF56767EFB8">FOURTHLY, By means of this light and know|ledge, which by the word and &s;pirit of God enters into the mind, <HI>a di&s;quieting &s;en&s;e of the guilt of &s;in is excited, with fear of puni&s;hment, and &s;ome kind of &s;orrow and compunction, accompanied with anxious thoughts and contrivances how to obtain pardon and deliverance.</HI> This al&s;o belongs to that prepara|tory work we are now con&s;idering. The Holy Spirit impre&s;&s;es upon the &s;oul &s;uch a conviction of its &s;in, guilt and danger, as excites &s;ome pain|ful &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery of &s;uch &s;tate, with earnest de&s;ires to be delivered from it. The degrees of this preparatory trouble and &s;orrow, are indeed very different in different per&s;ons, in whom it has a happy i&s;&s;ue. And therefore we ought not to pre&s;cribe certain mea&s;ures and degrees of the&s;e fears and di&s;quietudes, either as matter of duty, or nece&s;&s;ary to conver&s;ion. But conviction of &s;in is a duty, &amp; a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite to our believing in Chri&s;t. And &s;o is humiliation, that is a de|&s;pair of deliverance and &s;alvation in tho&s;e fal&s;e ways, which God has not appointed. And this conviction will unavoidably produce trouble of mind in &s;ome degree, which will never be re|moved effectually, while the conviction which ex|cited it remains, till the revelation of divine mercy in the go&s;pel is fully believed, and the way of &s;al|vation therein propo&s;ed is embraced with hearty acquie&s;cence. When therefore any appear to be convinced of their &s;in and guilt, and humbled out of their fal&s;e confidences, though we cannot cer|tainly determine where the&s;e convictions will land them at la&s;t, yet we mu&s;t &s;ay that they are a fa|vourable &s;ymptom, and have in their place a good &s;ub&s;erviency to &s;aving conver&s;ion.</P>

And that &s;ome are influenced to attend to it by him, "who has the hearts of all men in his hands, and turn|eth them as the rivers of water whither &s;oever he plea&s;eth." Thus far I &s;uppo&s;e a work of the Holy Spirit, preparatory to conver&s;ion, will be acknow|ledged by all profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians; therefore I &s;hall not &s;pend time to prove it.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="010643_0081_0F81BDF92445C058">BUT be&s;ides, previous to conver&s;ion there are further degrees of preparation, wrought in the &s;oul by the word and &s;pirit of God, con&s;i&s;ting in &s;ome knowledge of God's revealed will, conviction of &s;in, concern about e&s;caping the puni&s;hment of it, hopes of pardon, together with a care to attend to tho&s;e pre&s;cribed means, whereby the Holy Spi|rit applies to men the redemption propo&s;ed to them in the covenant of grace.

All who are dead are it is true equally void of life: But every portion of lifele&s;s matter is not alike fitted and di&s;po&s;ed for the reception of a vital principle, and to be a proper in&s;trument or organ for perception &amp; action, according to tho&s;e laws of nature which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed. So though we acknowledge that every unregenerate man is equally de&s;titute of &s;piritual life, yet &s;ome are better prepared than others for the reception, and exerci&s;e of &s;upernatural principles and abili|ties. "Some," &s;ays Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> <Q>may be in a greater forwardne&s;s and preparation for the work it&s;elf, of regeneration, and thereby in a greater nearne&s;s to the &s;tate of it than others.</Q> Of this we have a very lively emblem in the 37th chap. of Ezekiel: Where the Prophet de&s;cribes the vi&s;ion he had of a multitude of dry bones &s;cattered abroad in a valley. Upon his prophe|&s;ying to them there was fir&s;t a great &s;haking a|mong them, and they came together each bone in its proper place, then the &s;inews came upon them, after that they were covered with fle&s;h and &s;kin: But till the breath of life entred into the bodies, they were as incapable of perception and action as the rocks, yet they were better prepar|ed to be receptacles of living &s;ouls. Nor was life communicated, till the body which was to be ani|mated was thus prepared, and made a proper &s;ub|ject and organ, in and by which the &s;oul might receive ideas, and exert it&s;elf in actions agreable to its nature.</P>
<P>THUS though nothing that is wrought in or done by a &s;inner before regeneration, either ren|ders or manife&s;ts him to be more worthy of this grace than another, yet by the&s;e effects of the
<PB N="85" REF="010643_0084_0F81BDFB4BBB20C8">
word and &s;pirit upon him, which have been de|&s;cribed, he is more prepared for that new &s;tate, to which in regeneration he is introduced, and &s;o becomes a more meet &s;ubject of this grace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That vital principle which is communicated in rege|neration is to the &s;oul, as the &s;oul is to the body; its dignity, its quickning and governing principle, where|by it becomes capable of an&s;wering the end for which it was made. The body may &s;ub&s;i&s;t with all its na|tural and e&s;&s;ential properties, without the &s;oul; &s;o may the &s;oul, without this divine principle. But in this ca&s;e the body is naturally, and the &s;oul &s;piritually dead; the one tending to a &s;tate of natural corruption, the other to a &s;tate of moral depravity. Keeping the&s;e things in mind, we may illu&s;trate in &s;ome mea&s;ure, how and in what re&s;pect the &s;oul is &s;aid to be prepar|ed for regeneration and conver&s;ion, by a previous work of the &s;pirit. For it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this preparation may be con&s;idered is being either <HI>external,</HI> or <HI>internal.</HI> There is an <HI>external preparation</HI> for the union of a &s;oul to a body, which con&s;i&s;ts in providing &s;uitable objects for the &s;oul to conver&s;e with by means of the body, and placing them &s;o near, as that the organs of &s;en|&s;ation may be impre&s;&s;ed by them, and the nerves or animal &s;pirits put in motion. The eye would be u&s;e|le&s;s to the &s;oul without vi&s;ible objects, or light; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the other &s;en&s;es. So we read that the heavens and earth were created, before God made living creatures. Thus in the new creation, God has made preparation for the work of regenera|tion, by providing (if I may so &s;peak) and revealing outwardly in the go&s;pel, tho&s;e great and divine objects which are &s;uited to the new nature. The revelation of grace and truth by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, pre&s;ents to view tho&s;e glorious objects, in the knowledge, choice, pur|&s;uit and enjoyment of which, con&s;i&s;ts the proper ex|erci&s;e of the divine life. And the&s;e things are bro't near to men, in the report of the go&s;pel. Again, there is al&s;o an <HI>internal preparation,</HI> or a work of the Holy Spirit in and upon the &s;oul, whereby it is fitted and di&s;po&s;ed for the reception and exerci&s;e of the divine life. A body that is frozen and &s;tiff, who&s;e nerves and fluids are motionle&s;s and not ea&s;ily moved, is not in its pre|&s;ent condition &s;o fit a receptacle of a living &s;oul, as one that is warm and &s;upple, and e&s;pecially if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the blood actually circulating in the veins, and the other organs performing their &s;everal offices. And we might truly &s;ay that the one has a nearer capacity of vital action than the other. For according to the laws of nature which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed, the&s;e in|ternal motions of the fluids and nerves, are nece&s;&s;ary to all acts of the natural life. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a living &s;oul to be united to a &s;tiff and motionle&s;s body, it would be impri&s;oned, as it were, in a &s;tate of in&s;en|&s;ibility and inactivity. Thus the internal effects of the word and &s;pirit upon the mind and heart previous to conver&s;ion, prepare the &s;oul to receive and exerci&s;e the principle of &s;piritual life. They are to the &s;oul, as internal motion and warmth to the body. Tho' they be not life, yet they include a nearer capacity of vital exerci&s;es. For &s;uppo&s;e a man were endowed, by an immediate phy&s;ical operation of divine power, with that &s;upernatural <HI>&s;en&s;e or in&s;tinct</HI> which is communica|ted in regeneration, yet if he had no knowledge of the will of God, no conviction or &s;en&s;e of &s;in, &amp;c. how could he di&s;cern the &s;piritual glory of the go&s;pel, &s;o as to believe it becau&s;e of this lively evidence of divinity in &s;tamped upon it? How could he acquie&s;ce in the way of &s;alvation therein revealed? How could he repent of &s;in, and obey the commands of Chri&s;t?&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;peculative ideas of the truth revealed in the go&s;pel, and conveyed to the under&s;tanding, are the immediate objects about which the new creature is occupied. As therefore there can be no exerci&s;e of &s;en&s;itive life, without a previous impre&s;&s;ion upon the organs of &s;en&s;ation; &s;o there can be no exerci&s;e of &s;piritual life, without a previous perception of divine truth by the natural faculty of the understanding;&mdash;which is (if I may &s;o &s;peak) the organ of the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> calls this internal preparation for the work of regeneration a material di&s;po&s;ition for or unto it; which he thus explains: <Q>A material di&s;po&s;ition is that which di&s;po&s;eth, and &s;ome way maketh a &s;ub|ject fit for the reception of that which &s;hall be com|municated, added, or infu&s;ed into it as its form. So wood by dryne&s;s and a due compo&s;ure is made fit and ready to admit of firing, or continual fire. A formal di&s;po&s;ition is where one degree of the &s;ame kind, di&s;po&s;eth the &s;ubject unto farther degrees of it. The former we allow here, not the latter.</Q><BIBL>&mdash;<HI>Treati&s;e of the Holy Spirit,</HI> pag. 191, 192.</BIBL></NOTE></P>

and kept up, till through the influence of the &s;pirit it has accompli&s;hed its end and effect in their conver&s;ion. Now the attention of &s;inners to the call of the go&s;pel is awakened, and they are kept in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means, whereby the &s;aving knowledge of the truth is obtained, by this preparatory work which is here contended for. To excite and keep up mens attention to tho&s;e outward means, whereby God is ordinarily plea&s;ed to effectuate his gracious purpo&s;es towards mankind, the Holy Spirit makes u&s;e of com|mands and exhortations, together with tho&s;e ex|ternal evidences of the truth and divine authority of the go&s;pel, which are propo&s;ed to all the hear|ers thereof in the mini&s;try of the word. So that before men are enabled to believe &s;avingly in Chri&s;t, and turn to God through him, there is a &s;ubordinate work of the Holy Spirit by the word, in and upon the &s;oul, which has a tendency and &s;ub&s;erviency to this happy change.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD <HI>ordinarily gives the new heart only to tho&s;e who are prepared for it in the manner before mentioned.</HI> It is his u&s;ual way in the conver&s;ion, of &s;inners, to make them fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea&s;ure of their mi&s;erable helple&s;s &s;tate in them|&s;elves, and their dependance upon his &s;overeign favour for deliverance, and then comfort them wih a &s;piritual view of the glorious foundation of hope and joy which the go&s;pel pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>IN proof of this we may bring an argument by no means contemptible from analogy. I own &s;uch kind of rea&s;oning are oftentimes very &s;lip|pery and uncertain: But in &s;ome ca&s;es they ap|pear to have great weight. In particular our pre&s;ent point I think will receive illu&s;tration and
<PB N="89" REF="010643_0088_0F81BDFE48E6B3A8">
evidence, by our con&s;idering in what manner God has been wont to work, in carrying his purpo&s;es into execution.</P>
<P>IT has been God's u&s;ual method, when about to accompli&s;h any &s;ignal work for the manife&s;ta|tion of his glory, to proceed gradually, and make way for the completion thereof by previous ope|rations. Thus in the fir&s;t creation, we may ob|&s;erve an orderly progre&s;&s;ion in God's working. Every thing effected in its proper order. What|ever is done, makes way for what is to follow. The heavens and earth, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, the trees and herbs were fir&s;t made, and then liv|ing creatures to move upon the face of the earth, or fly in the heavens. And la&s;t of all man who was to have dominion over the other creatures, and for who&s;e u&s;e this world was e&s;pecially cre|ated. And in the creation of man, fir&s;t his body was formed of the du&s;t of the earth, and then the breath of life was breathed into his no&s;trils, and man became a living &s;oul. The crowning act of creating efficiency which gave the material world its chief importance was not introduced, till the Creator by &s;ix days working had made prepara|tion for it. Almighty power could have begun and con&s;ummated his work in a moment. But divine wi&s;dom &s;aw meet to proceed in a gradual and regular order, every &s;tep of the whole pro|ce&s;s making way for the next, till the whole was fini&s;hed. And herein he has given us a view of his ordinary method of working. In particular the creation of man may properly be looked upon as in this re&s;pect analogous to his regeneration, and therefore this is called the new creation. Yea the word regeneration alludes plainly to natural
<PB N="90" REF="010643_0089_0F81BDFF88338490">
generation, in which are previous di&s;po&s;itions of matter before the vital principle is infu&s;ed. And there is rea&s;on to think that an analogy in this re&s;pect is intended hereby to be intimated to us.</P>
<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e is the deliverance of I&s;rael's po&s;terity from their Egyptian bondage, and &s;ettlement in the land of promi&s;e. We have good rea&s;on to look upon this deliverance as typical of the deliverance of particular per&s;ons from the &s;lavery of &s;atan, and their introduction to the privileges and happine&s;s of God's &s;piritual kingdom. The Apo&s;tle plain|ly con&s;iders it in this view in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. And accordingly tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which had a primary reference to the I&s;raelites, and their &s;ettlement in that re&s;t which was promi&s;ed to them in the land of Canaan, are applied and addre&s;&s;ed to chri&s;tians for their ad|monition and in&s;truction, in pur&s;uit of that re&s;t in heaven which remains for the people of God. Such an application of the&s;e texts is proper and pertinent, &s;uppo&s;ing the events immediately point|ed at in them had a typical reference to the re|demption and &s;alvation of men by Chri&s;t: And I &s;ee not how the Apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning from them can appear &s;olid upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition. We may therefore expect to find in the manner of I&s;|rael's deliverance from the hou&s;e of bondage, a repre&s;entation of the method of divine grace, in tran&s;lating &s;inners from the kingdom of &s;atan, in|to the kingdom of the dear Son of God.</P>
<P>IF now we turn our eyes to the hi&s;tory of this memorable tran&s;action, we &s;hall find that they were fir&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of their evil ca&s;e under
<PB N="91" REF="010643_0090_0F81BE0009D17D20">
the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and cryed unto God by rea&s;on of their hard bondage, before he delivered them from it. Hereby they were prepared to hearken with joy to the procla|mation of liberty. So at the Red &s;ea, they were fir&s;t convinced that unle&s;s God would &s;ave them they mu&s;t peri&s;h: The impa&s;&s;ible mountains be|ing on each &s;ide, the &s;ea before them, and the Egyptian army in their rear, and then God open|ed before them a wonderful way of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>AND if we look thro' the &s;criptures, we &s;hall I think find, that it has been God's ordinary method to prepare his people for the reception of remarka|ble favours, by making them &s;en&s;ible of their need of them, and thereby exciting them to look to him for them. And as a late writer of our own has ob&s;erved, <Q>there is an analogy ob&s;ervable in God's di&s;pen&s;ations and deliverances which he works for his people, and the manife&s;tations which he makes of him&s;elf to them, both or|dinary and extraordinary.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Edwards</HI> on religious affections, pag. 52,&mdash;56.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND perhaps &s;omething may be argued by way of analogy in favour of a work of conviction and humiliation preparatory to &s;aving faith, from God's conduct towards his church, con&s;idered as a collective body. Says the author la&s;t quoted; <Q>There is all rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that God deals with particular believers as he dealt with his church, which he fir&s;t made to hear his voice in the law with terrible thunders and lightnings, and kept her under that &s;chool-ma&s;ter to prepare her for Chri&s;t; and then comforted her with the joy|ful &s;ound of the go&s;pel from mount Sion.</Q> In a way &s;omewhat &s;imilar, the law is &s;till to in|dividual

per&s;ons, as it was formerly to the church, a &s;chool ma&s;ter to bring them to Chri&s;t, that they may be ju&s;tified by faith.</P>
<P>BUT the account we have in the evangelical hi&s;tory, of the manner in which the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation was introduced, is I think more plainly to our purpo&s;e. When the Lord Je&s;us was about to open the kind commi&s;&s;ion upon which he was &s;ent into the world, <HI>to preach the go&s;pel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliver|ance to the captives, and recovering of &s;ight to the blind, and to &s;et at liberty them that are brui&s;ed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 4.18.</NOTE> John the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent before him, to prepare the minds of the people for tho&s;e gracious words. And this he did by a very awakening manner of preaching, charging their &s;ins home upon their con&s;ciences, and warning them of their danger of the wrath to come, and of being cut down and ca&s;t into the fire, by the ax which even then lay at the root of the tree. He was a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent before his face in the &s;pirit and power of Elias, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, by awakening their con&s;ciences, convincing them of &s;in, that &s;o they might be in a fit di&s;po&s;ition of mind, to attend unto, and receive the revelation of grace &amp; truth by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That &s;inners may hearken to this word of &s;alvation, they mu&s;t know that they have de&s;troyed them&s;elves. And becau&s;e they do not ea&s;ily entertain &s;uch a tho't of them&s;elves, and &s;o &s;light the glad news of &s;alvation, they are awakened to hear them by the voice of the law, and its work upon their consciences, the Lord Chri&s;t by his Spirit making the law &s;ub&s;ervient to the go&s;pel, by this means &s;hutting up &s;inners to the faith, and &s;topping their mouths, that they may be &s;ubject to the judgment of God, and &s;o hearken to the glad tidings of &s;alvation." <HI>Glas's Te&s;timony of the King of Martyrs,</HI> chap. 5. &s;ect. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="010643_0092_0F81BE0146204878">AND that this is the general method and order in which the work of conver&s;ion is accompli&s;hed, may be more directly argued from &s;everal of our Saviour's parables. It may be ob&s;erved in the parable of the prodigal &s;on, which is commonly thought to exhibit the method of divine grace in calling &s;inners into his go&s;pel kingdom, that be|fore he was received and fea&s;ted by his father, he came to him&s;elf, &s;o far as to be &s;en&s;ible of, and affected with his indigent &s;tarving condition, and own him&s;elf to be an undutiful &s;inner, unworthy to be called his &s;on. And in the parable of the &s;ervant who owed his king ten thou&s;and talents, we are told that his lord called him to a reckoning, charged him with the debt, demanded payment, and in default hereof commanded him to be &s;old, and his wife, &amp; children, &amp; all that he had. By this means he is made to humble him&s;elf, ac|knowledging him&s;elf bound to him in the whole &s;um, and then receives a full acquittance of the free mercy and bounty of his Lord.</P>
<P>AND are there not particular calls and invitati|ons in the go&s;pel, directed to awakened &s;inners?

and burdened with guilt, &s;o that their hearts are &s;inking within them, the&s;e are invited to come to Chri&s;t for re&s;t. Nothing can give them effectual relief, but the grace of the go&s;pel; and &s;uch is the &s;tate of their mind that the news of a Saviour will be welcome and refre&s;hing to them, as cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul. And therefore they are called and invited, as tho&s;e who&s;e immediate con|cern it is to come to Chris;t, and ca&s;t their burden upon him.

And when they are thus prepared to hear and receive the report of the go&s;pel, then they are called and directed to behold the "Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world." No righteou&s;ne&s;s or qualifications of ours are re|quired as recommendations to the mercy of God, but a conviction of &s;in and mi&s;ery is needful to awaken our attention to the revelation of God's grace, to keep us in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means by which the Holy Spirit ordinarily works &s;aving faith in the &s;oul, and to render the go&s;pel, agrea|ble to the proper import of the word, "glad ti|dings to us."</P>

yet, for any thing we know, he might after that be gradually prepared for the new birth, by a work of conviction &amp; humiliation.

So far from truth is what has lately been hinted by &s;ome, that, in re&s;pect of the manner of his conver&s;ion, he was de&s;igned for a pattern to all that &s;hould hereafter believe. If the merciful truth (as &s;ome chu&s;e to &s;peak) &s;urprized him upon the road, then the knowledge of it was con|veyed to him by a miraculous objective revela|tion of it, and not by means of the ordinary di&s;|pen&s;ation of God's word.

<P>I MIGHT further confirm the point in hand, from the common experience and acknowledg|ment of tho&s;e who have given the be&s;t evidences of &s;incerity in their profe&s;&s;ions of faith, and obe|dience to Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>SERMON IV. That tho&s;e who attend to the Means of Grace, are more likely to ob|tain Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;till upon the fir&s;t argument to prove the obligation and encouragement of mankind in general, who hear the call of the go&s;pel to la|bour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life. The argument is briefly this: That they who at|tend to the common means of grace are more like|ly to obtain &s;alvation, than they who neglect them. In confirmation of this I have proved, that &s;ome who are not in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, are more likely to attain to it than others. Wherein this probability appears, has been al&s;o declared and vindicated. I am therefore now ready to proceed to the SECOND POINT propo&s;ed to confirmation, which compleats our pre&s;ent argument, <HI>That what manife&s;ts the &s;tate of &s;ome to be more hopeful than that of others, either con&s;i&s;ts in, or depends upon, and is obtained by, their endeavours in attending the or|dinary means of grace.</HI> Our attending to the&s;e du|ties
<PB N="99" REF="010643_0098_0F81BE080CAB6498">
has a tendency, by the appointment and ble&s;&s;ing of God, to promote that work of illumination, con|viction and reformation, which is ordinarily prepa|ratory to conver&s;ion. Yea it is in the way of at|tending to the&s;e duties that the work it&s;elf, of con|ver&s;ion, is accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>AS this contains the &s;ub&s;tance of what is to be pleaded for in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, it may be pro|per in the fir&s;t place to &s;tate the matter a little more exactly, to prevent exception or mi&s;take. Let it then be ob&s;erved, <HI>that I acknowledge there is a pre|paratory work of divine grace which prevents or is before-hand of all human endeavours.</HI> Thus it is in no degree owing to any thing in us, or done by us, that we are born in a part of the world that is enlightned by the go&s;pel&mdash;that we have in our early days had wi&s;e and faithful in&s;tructors, and an ac|quaintance with &s;uch who&s;e conver&s;ation and ex|ample were adapted to direct and quicken us in our duty&mdash;and that we were taught and required to read the &s;criptures. It is al&s;o to be a&s;cribed, many times at lea&s;t, to a directing providence, without any de&s;ign or intention of ours, that we read, or hear &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es as are in a &s;pecial manner cal|culated to in&s;truct and awaken us, and that we are &s;ometimes vi&s;ited with remarkable afflictions or de|liverances, which tend to rou&s;e men to &s;erious con|&s;ideration, and often prove the occa&s;ion of &s;aving good to them. Be&s;ides it has been allowed that the fir&s;t motions of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, are before any de&s;ires and endeavours after &s;alvation in us, ina&s;much as all our &s;eeking is prompted by a previous influence of grace. In the&s;e re&s;pects &s;ome are brought nearer than others to the kingdom of God, without any concurring endeavours of theirs&punc;
<PB N="100" REF="010643_0099_0F81BCEB089259E8">
All this belongs to what may be called the prevent|ing grace of God.</P>
<P>BUT though the work of divine grace in prepar|ing a &s;oul for regeneration is begun without any act|ive concurrence of ours, yet our active compliance, and endeavours in a way of attendance to pre&s;cribed duties, is ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s and completion of it. The fir&s;t kindly impre&s;&s;ions are indeed from preventing grace; but the continuance and increa&s;e of the Spirit's influence, with the effects thereof in illumination, conviction and conver&s;ion, are u&s;ually found only in tho&s;e who are previou&s;ly moved and excited to an&s;werable exertments of their active faculties. Herein it is true God worketh in us to will and to do, as well as in the work of &s;anctification. But our will and endeavour is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in both ca&s;es, in order to our attaining the end, which the operations of God's grace have a tendency unto. God's fir&s;t end in u&s;ing means with &s;inners, and communicating the influences of his Spirit in and with them, is to awaken their at|tention, and put them upon diligent ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e duties which he has appointed to be means of their obtaining further communications of light and grace, whereby they may be thoroughly awakened, convinced of their &s;in and guilt, and led to true re|pentance and conver&s;ion. If then men re&s;i&s;t the Spirit in his fir&s;t &s;triving with them, and will not awake to con&s;ideration, nor attend to the means of further light and grace, they then receive the grace of God in vain.</P>
<P>BUT that we may under&s;tand more clearly and di&s;tinctly, how far, and in what re&s;pects a man is brought nearer the kingdom of God, and his ca&s;e rendred more hopeful, by means of his endeavours
<PB N="101" REF="010643_0100_0F81BCEBCE2C3838">
in a way of attendance to pre&s;cribed duties, we mu&s;t call over briefly &s;ome things that were offered in the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hewing in what re&s;pects &s;ome are &s;aid to be more likely than others to obtain &s;alva|tion. Now whatever may be thought to have a favourable a&s;pect and tendency may, &s;o far as the point in hand is concerned, be reduced to the&s;e three heads, viz. Outward means and privileges,&mdash;the agency and influence of the Holy Spirit in and by the&s;e means&mdash;And the effects produced hereby, in the mind, heart and life. If then human endea|vours are of any u&s;e or advantage in all, or any of the&s;e re&s;pects, then the&s;e endeavours have a good u&s;e and tendency, and &s;inners ought to be pre&s;&s;ed and encouraged thereunto, as conducive to their obtaining eternal life. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider, each of the&s;e points di&s;tinctly, And</P>
<P N="1">I. HAVE <HI>any doings or endeavours of the unre|generate a tendency to render their outward circum|&s;tances either better or wor&s;e in re&s;pect of &s;piritual privileges?</HI>&mdash;A ca&s;e &s;o plain as this appears to be, will, I think, be ea&s;ily re&s;olved. Is it not mo&s;t manife&s;t that our outward condition depends very much, under God, upon our own choice? Some it is true are by the kindne&s;s of providence more hap|pily &s;ituated than others in re&s;pect of outward means of grace, antecedently to any choice of their own. Some are born in places that are peculiarly favoured in this re&s;pect: Others are conducted to &s;uch places by a &s;ecret influence, not knowing whither they go: And others have the means &s;ent to them without their de&s;ire or procurement, as has been ob&s;erved:&mdash;And herein the &s;overeignty of God is manife&s;ted. But it is as evidently true that people are very much at liberty to chu&s;e, whether they will put them&s;elves,
<PB N="102" REF="010643_0101_0F81BCECA3E506A0">
or continue in the way of chri&s;tian in&s;truction or not. Our Saviour's maxim holds true in this ca&s;e, "who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given; but who|&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken away." The Jews might have all along enjoyed the out|ward means of divine knowledge, if they had not refu&s;ed them and as far as they were able put the word of God far from them, &s;o judged them&s;elves unworthy of eternal life. Is it not owing to men's hating and rejecting in&s;truction, that the go&s;pel is not at this day preached among all the nations of the world?&mdash;Their oppo&s;ing the means of grace at a di&s;tance, is the great cau&s;e and occa&s;ion why they are not brought near to them. And where God &s;ends the word of &s;alvation, and &s;ets up the light of the go&s;pel, is it not plain, that &s;ome by their wilful refu&s;al of it keep out of the way of being &s;avingly benefited by it, and on the contrary ru&s;h greedily into the way of all kind of &s;in, error and temptation, whereby their &s;tate is rendred deplorable, and in a manner de&s;perate? But when men are willing, and take pains to have and attend to the outward means of grace, they are ordinarily continued and increa&s;ed to them. If it be the care and endeavour of any one to avoid the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who have no regard for religion, and to &s;hun tho&s;e places where nothing is to be learned but impiety and wickedne&s;s, this will tend to pre&s;erve him from the&s;e dangers and temptations. If he de&s;ire to be in&s;tructed in the doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel, and accor|dingly &s;eeks for, and attends upon the be&s;t means he can have acce&s;s to, he will be likely to have his pre&s;ent advantages continued, yea, and have further helps, and greater opportunities than he at pre&s;ent enjoys. We who live where the chri&s;tian religion is profe&s;&s;ed, have peculiar outward a&s;&s;i&s;tances offer|ed
<PB N="103" REF="010643_0102_0F81BCED5289D980">
to us, whereby we may come to the knowledge of the truth, and experience its renewing and &s;ancti|fying influence upon our hearts. But if we refu&s;e, and endeavour to &s;hun them, we may effectually deprive our&s;elves of them in a great mea&s;ure; and on the contrary if we improve them, we &s;hall hereby find our&s;elves led and conducted into the way of further helps and advantages of this kind. We have the &s;criptures in our hands; but how can they be a means of making us wi&s;e to &s;alvation, if we will not read them? The go&s;pel is preached among us; but this cannot be a means of converting us, unle&s;s we will hear it. This then appears to be the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e: The fir&s;t outward means which God u&s;es for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, pre|vents all their endeavours; but then there are fur|ther outward privileges which God ordinarily vouch|&s;afes to tho&s;e who de&s;ire and endeavour to obtain, and hold them; from which they who de&s;pi&s;e and reject them, are excluded. The Jews at Antioch, to whom Paul preached the go&s;pel, might have had the privilege of further in&s;truction, if they had de|&s;ired it, and been willing to receive it; but when they were filled with envy, and &s;pake again&s;t tho&s;e things which they had heard, contradicting and bla&s;|pheming, yea proceeded &s;o far in their oppo&s;ition, as to rai&s;e a per&s;ecution again&s;t the apo&s;tles, and expel them from their coa&s;ts, they were ju&s;tly de|prived afterwards, of tho&s;e advantages which they wilfully refu&s;ed. Upon the whole, if men are wil|ling and de&s;irous to attend the means of grace, they are u&s;ually favoured with the continuance and en|largement of their &s;piritual privileges; but if they refu&s;e in&s;truction, and reject the coun&s;el of God a|gain&s;t them&s;elves, they are ju&s;tly left to remain un|der the power of that darkne&s;s which they love ra|ther
<PB N="104" REF="010643_0103_0F81BCEE17E48420">
than light. It is true we ought to a&s;cribe it to the grace of God, that any are influenced and en|abled &s;o to improve their outward advantages, as to receive further helps of this kind. And on the o|ther hand, it is owing to men's wickedne&s;s that they hate the light, and oppo&s;e the outward means of grace, as we have formerly had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve. But whatever be the occa&s;ion of this difference of conduct, the con&s;equences are of great importance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The&s;e things (that is an outward attendance unto the di&s;pen&s;ation of the word of God, with tho&s;e other external means of grace which accompany it, or are appointed therein, and a diligent intention of mind in attendance on the&s;e means, to under&s;tand and receive the things revealed and declared as the mind and will of God) are required of us in order to regeneration, and it is in the power of our own wills to comply with them, and we may ob&s;erve concerning them, that the omi&s;&s;ion of them, the neglect of men in them, is the principal occa&s;ion and cau&s;e of the eternal ruin of the &s;ouls of the ge|nerality of them to whom or among&s;t whom the go&s;pel is preached. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil, John 3.19. The generality of men know full well, that they do in this matter no more what they are able, than what they &s;hould. All plead&mdash;able pretences of inability and weakne&s;s are far from them. They cannot but know here, and they &s;hall be forced to confe&s;s hereafter, that it was merely from their own cur&s;ed &s;loth, with love of the world and &s;in, that they were diverted from a diligent attendance on the means of conver&s;ion, and the &s;e|dulous exerci&s;e of their minds about them.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Owen on the Holy Sprit,</HI> pag. 193.</BIBL></NOTE> For by a due improvement of our outward advan|tages, we &s;hall be likely to have them increa&s;ed and prolonged, and &s;o in this re&s;pect be brought near

to the kingdom of God: But by neglecting and refu&s;ing them, we for&s;ake our own mercies, and as far as in us lies, keep our&s;elves out of the reach of that grace, which God is wont to convey in and by the&s;e means to the children of men.</P>
<P>LET us now, in the 2d place, con&s;ider, <HI>whether men's conduct has any kind or degree of conducivene&s;s to further or hinder their receiving inward influences, and a&s;&s;i&s;tances from the Holy spirit?</HI>&mdash;Whether the continuance and increa&s;e of tho&s;e common influen|ces of grace, which are communicated to men un|regenerate, with and by the outward means before &s;poken of, depends at all upon the improvement they make of the&s;e means? And whether the withdraw of this grace, and the with-holding of further &s;up|plies of it, be occa&s;ioned by, and owing to, their neglecting, and re&s;i&s;ting what they have received? Now this, I think, both &s;cripture and experience will warrant us to affirm. It is always in con&s;e|quence of men's grieving and quenching the Spirit, that he withdraws his kindly influences from them. This is an awful, but ju&s;t puni&s;hment, for their wil|ful neglect of, and oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e gracious mo|tions and &s;olicitations which they have experienced. To this purpo&s;e the Divines at Dort argue and con|clude&mdash;<Q>God for&s;akes not tho&s;e whom he thus works upon (by his word and Spirit) nor cea&s;es to further them in the true way to conver&s;ion, till he is for&s;aken by them, by a voluntary neglect or repul&s;e of this fir&s;t grace. The talent of grace, once given by God, is taken away from no one, except him who by his own fault fir&s;t buried it. Mat. 25.28. Hence it is that we are often ad|moni&s;hed in &s;cripture, that we re&s;i&s;t not the Spi|rit, that we quench not the Spirit, that we receive
<PB N="106" REF="010643_0105_0F81BCEFB68FD988">
not the grace of God in vain, that we depart not from God, Heb. 27. Yea this is mo&s;t manife&s;tly pointed out as the rea&s;on of God's for&s;aking men, that God is fir&s;t for&s;aken by men. Prov. 1.24. Becau&s;e I have called and ye refu&s;ed, I al&s;o will laugh at your de&s;truction. 2 Chron. 24.20. Be|cau&s;e ye have for&s;aken the Lord, he hath for&s;aken you. But there is not the lea&s;t hint in &s;cripture, that God is wont, or hath a will ever without the previous fault of man, to take away from any one the help of his exciting grace, or any a&s;&s;i&s;tance ordained for the conver&s;ion of man, which he hath once conferred.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. Synodi Dordract. part 2. pag. 167. quarto.</NOTE></P>
<P>OUR conduct, in improving or re&s;i&s;ting the in|fluences of the Holy Spirit, is therefore of great importance in its tendency and effects. If men do not quench the Spirit of grace, but comply with his motions, he will continue &s;triving, moving and breathing upon their &s;ouls. Yea by improving di|ligently the grace they have received, they &s;hall ob|tain further degrees. Though I do not plead for a promi&s;e of regeneration to the endeavours of the unconverted, yet we have, I think, rea&s;on to con|clude, that they who comply with the motions of God's Spirit, in that preparatory work which has been di&s;cour&s;ed of, &s;hall receive further influences and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, whereby they may become more and more prepared for the reception, and exerci&s;e of the divine life, and &s;o advance gra|dually towards the kingdom of God. Hereby they may attain to more divine knowledge, and con|viction of &s;in, and be taken off more and more from &s;elf dependance, and fal&s;e confidences. Yea they may at length be &s;o convinced of the in&s;ufficiency

of tho&s;e fal&s;e refuges, to which they u&s;ed to betake them&s;elves when pre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, as to abandon them all. For this belongs to that work of humiliation, which is antecedent to &s;aving conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>NOW I apprehend that it is not ob&s;curely &s;ug|ge&s;ted in the holy &s;criptures, that &s;inners &s;hall receive further degrees of grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Spirit of God, if they do not wilfully re|&s;i&s;t his gracious operations, and thereby quench his kindly influences upon their hearts. Tho&s;e words of our Lord, which we find &s;everal times repeated, &s;eem to imply as much. "Who&s;oever hath" (that is who&s;oever holds, or improves what he hath, for &s;o the word is &s;ometimes under&s;tood, &s;ee Heb. 12.28.) "to him &s;hall be given: And who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken a|way." This is delivered as a univer&s;al rule or maxim, applicable to every kind of gifts and ta|lents conferred upon mankind: And it imports, that the way to have them increa&s;ed is to improve them. That this is the true intent of the words, will I think plainly appear, to every one that will examine the &s;everal occa&s;ions on which they were &s;poken. And I &s;ee no rea&s;on why that pa&s;&s;age, in Mat. 7.7&mdash;10. may not properly be expound|ed in the &s;ame manner. "A&s;k and it &s;hall be given you, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find, knock and it &s;hall be opened unto you: For every one that a&s;keth receiveth, and he that &s;eeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it &s;hall be opened. If ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &s;hall your Father in hea|ven give good things (that is, as Luke expre&s;&s;es it, give the Holy Spirit) to them that a&s;k him."

The&s;e words undoubtedly contain a promi&s;e of an increa&s;e of grace to believers, upon their &s;eek|ing for it.

And there &s;eems to be the more rea&s;on to receive this inter|pretation, becau&s;e it appears from the two la&s;t ver&s;es of this chapter, that Chri&s;t's &s;ermon on the mount was addre&s;&s;ed to the multitude, as well as to his di&s;ciples. Now as it is the duty of all to a&s;k of God the gift of the Holy Spirit, &s;o it is rea|&s;onable to conclude, that it was our Saviour's de|&s;ign in the&s;e words to propo&s;e unto his hearers in general an encouraging motive unto this duty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many of the conditional promi&s;es in &s;cripture are, I ap|prehend, to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame manner.

It will not be ea&s;y to &s;hew how the&s;e promi&s;es can give any encouragement to the endeavours of men unregenerate, if this expo|&s;ition be not allowed.

I &s;hall only recite one pa&s;&s;age from a noted writer of our own. It is the late Pre&s;i|dent Edwards, in his &s;ermon on pre&s;&s;ing into the king|dom of God. It is plain from many pa&s;&s;ages in this di&s;cour&s;e, that by pre&s;&s;ing into the kingdom of God, he means the &s;triving of an unconverted &s;inner to ob|tain an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t.

<P>BUT here ari&s;es a que&s;tion or two of &s;ome mo|ment, which we mu&s;t con&s;ider briefly before we proceed any further. It will be a&s;ked, may one who is not &s;avingly united to Chri&s;t by faith, take encouragement from any promi&s;e to hope for favours and ble&s;&s;ings of any kind from God?</P>
<P>I ANSWER fir&s;t, It is a certain and undeniable fact, that &s;inners do receive favours and ble&s;&s;ings from God, before they are in a &s;tate of accept|ance with him, by a &s;pecial and &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. The common gifts of providence of which mankind in general are partakers, are evi|dently favours and in&s;tances of the goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s of God. Many are further favoured with the outward call of the go&s;pel. They have means and advantages for attaining to the know|ledge of the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t. They
<PB N="111" REF="010643_0110_0F81BCF4C70A9108">
have a perfect revelation of the whole matter of their faith and duty, and enjoy tho&s;e ordinances, and outward means of grace, whereby the bene|fits of redemption are communicated and applied to man. And there are &s;ome, who be&s;ides the&s;e outward privileges are the &s;ubjects of the influ|ences of the Holy Spirit, whereby they are awa|kened and enlightned in various degrees, though they are not true believers in Chri&s;t, nor &s;o united to him as to be in a &s;tate of &s;alvation, in the mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e. Now all the&s;e things are exer|ci&s;es of the goodne&s;s and mercy of God to &s;inners. The &s;criptures will warrant us to con&s;ider and &s;peak of them in this view, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome by abu&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ings of God turn them into cur&s;es, and make them the occa&s;ions of inhancing their guilt, and future puni&s;hment. This has, I think, never been denyed by any. Moreover,</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o generally acknowledged that the&s;e common favours were purcha&s;ed for men by Chri&s;t. To him the world in general is beholden for all the good they enjoy. To this purpo&s;e are the words of Mr. Charnock&mdash;"Had not Chri&s;t," &s;ays he, <Q>interpo&s;ed to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God, man upon his &s;in would have actually been bound over to puni&s;hment as well as the fallen angels were upon their's, and been fettered in chains as &s;trong as tho&s;e &s;pirits feel. The rea|&s;on why man was not hurled to the &s;ame de|plorable condition upon his &s;in, as they were, is Chri&s;t's promi&s;e of taking our nature, and not their's. In regard of tho&s;e fruits of this patience, Chri&s;t is &s;aid to buy the wickede&s;t a|po&s;tates from him. 2 Pet. 2.1. Denying the Lord that bought them. Such were bought

This patience mu&s;t be either upon the account of the law, or the go&s;pel; for there are no other rules where|by God governs the world. A fruit of the law it was not; that &s;pake nothing but cur&s;es after di&s;obedience. It mu&s;t be therefore upon the account of the go&s;pel, and a fruit of the cove|nant of grace.</Q>&mdash;Thus far this learned author. [Vol. 1. pag. 478.]</P>
<P>HENCE it will follow, that by the death of Chri&s;t, ble&s;&s;ings have been purcha&s;ed for mankind in general. Common ble&s;&s;ings are be&s;towed on the world for his &s;ake. There is therefore, a common relation, or union of men to Chri&s;t, which is the ground of their receiving the&s;e benefits which he purcha&s;ed for them. All are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t, who receive any benefits for his &s;ake. We may then without any incon|veniency allow that the&s;e benefits are founded upon the merits of Chri&s;t, and purcha&s;ed by him, and that they who partake of them are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e related to Chri&s;t, and intere&s;ted in him.&mdash;Yea this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, unle&s;s the&s;e benefits are conferred on &s;inners without any regard to the redemption of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND if any &s;hould in&s;i&s;t that the&s;e are not the fruits of Chri&s;t's merits, and that no one is in any re&s;pects intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t, until he &s;avingly be|lieves on him, then they mu&s;t acknowledge that God may and does confer his favours and grace on tho&s;e who are not in any &s;en&s;e united to Chri&s;t.
<PB N="113" REF="010643_0112_0F81BCF8355C5EB0">
So that upon either &s;uppo&s;ition the difficulty will come to nothing. God does in fact be&s;tow the&s;e favours, in what manner &s;oever it is done. And if he may without any di&s;honour to his perfecti|ons be&s;tow them, then there is no difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing that he may (if, he thinks fit) declare unto &s;inners for their encouragement, that they &s;hall not &s;eek for them in vain. If it be thought un&s;uitable that God &s;hould <HI>promi&s;e</HI> any kind of favours to tho&s;e who are not &s;o in Chri&s;t as to be in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification, then it is un&s;uitable for him to <HI>confer</HI> any kind of favours on &s;uch per&s;ons. For it is to be ob&s;erved, that the weight of the objection, as it is commonly urged, does not lie &s;o much again&s;t the promi&s;e of ble&s;&s;ings to &s;in|ners, as again&s;t the be&s;towment. No con&s;iderate per&s;on will find any difficulty in allowing that what is fit to be done by God, may if he thinks proper be the matter of promi&s;e. A &s;pecial and &s;aving union to Chri&s;t is not nece&s;&s;ary as an ante|cedent ground of God's be&s;towing upon us the common bounties of his providence, and the com|mon grace of his &s;pirit, or even that grace where|by we are enabled to believe unto &s;alvation. For it is by faith that we are fir&s;t &s;avingly united to Chri&s;t. Our &s;pecial intere&s;t in him is therefore the con&s;equence, and not the ground of our fir&s;t believing on him. In other words, our fir&s;t in|grafting into Chri&s;t, is a favour in&s;eparably con|nected with ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, and yet it would be a contradiction to &s;ay that the be&s;tow|ment of this favour was founded on our being an|tecedently in Chri&s;t by a &s;pecial and &s;aving union.</P>
<P>THERE is then, I apprehend, as good as a pro|mi&s;e tho' not of &s;alvation, or converting grace,
<PB N="114" REF="010643_0113_0F81BCF887ACC860">
to the endeavours of the unconverted, yet of fur|ther grace and influence of the Holy Spirit to tho&s;e who improve what they have received.&mdash;Only this mu&s;t be under&s;tood with one limitation, viz. that it holds true only during the continu|ance of mens probationary &s;tate in this life, which depends intirely upon the &s;overeign plea&s;ure of God, to determine. Nor is it any objection that the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, "all the promi&s;es are in Chri&s;t." This is readily granted in the utmo&s;t extent, to which the univer&s;al term, can with any appear|ance of truth be under&s;tood. All the promi&s;es, or encouragements which God has ever given to fallen man, yea I will add, all the unpromi&s;ed mercy that he has ever vi&s;ited mankind with, mu&s;t be considered as the fruit of Chri&s;t's redemption, and therefore the Redeemer &s;tands in a common relation to and connection with the race of Adam. But I conceive however that the Apo&s;tle in the words above quoted, means the &s;pecial promi&s;es of the covenant of grace, which pre&s;uppo&s;e a &s;pe|cial relation to Chri&s;t, as the ground and condi|tion of our partaking of them; and then nothing can be argued from them again&s;t promi&s;es of a different kind, to per&s;ons in a different &s;tate. But the&s;e things may come under con&s;ideration again in another place.</P>
<P>IT may be further enquired&mdash;Do not men always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t in this common operation, till they are overcome by that grace which is irre&s;i&s;tably efficacious? I an&s;wer, it is true, that the natural tendency of this grace is re&s;i&s;ted by every one who &s;till remains uncon|verted. For the tendency of it is to influence men to repent &s;incerely of their &s;ins, and turn to God. But &s;o far as any good effects are wrought
<PB N="115" REF="010643_0114_0F81BCF94B57E670">
in and upon us by the Holy Spirit, his agency is not re&s;i&s;ted. There is no compul&s;ion or violence offered to the liberty of the will, either in con|ver&s;ion, or that conviction, and humiliation, and reformation which is ordinarily antecedent and preparatory thereunto. To enquire then whether a &s;inner does always and univer&s;ally re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t until he is regenerated, is the &s;ame as to a&s;k, whether the agency of the Spirit, previous to regeneration, be ever productive of any good effect. Or, (which comes to the &s;ame thing) whe|ther there be any duties performed by, or inward effects wrought in a &s;inner, by the common grace of the Spirit, preparatory to conver&s;ion. But this has been already, con&s;idered, and the reality of this preparatory work, I tru&s;t, has been &s;ufficient|ly proved from &s;cripture and experience. How|ever oppo&s;ite the corrupted nature of man is to that which is good, our actual re&s;i&s;tance to the work of the Holy Spirit cea&s;es, and without any force upon our natural liberty is overcome, &s;o far forth as the Spirit's agency proves effectual to the production of any good effect in and upon our &s;ouls. He then who receives the light and con|viction which is objectively propo&s;ed in the word, and is thereupon affected with a &s;en&s;e of his &s;inful and wretched e&s;tate, and cheri&s;hes a religious con|cern about the &s;alvation of his &s;oul, and guards again&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins and temptations which tend to harden him in &s;ecurity and impenitence, &s;uch an one does &s;o far comply with the motions of the Holy Spirit. Whereas he who oppo&s;es convicti|ons, who counteracts the dictates of con&s;cience, who ca&s;ts off fear, and will walk in the way of his heart, and the &s;ight of his own eyes, he who
<PB N="116" REF="010643_0115_0F81BCFA1E0CCB78">
does thus, re&s;i&s;teth the grace of God, and as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, receives it in vain.</P>
<P>AND however the unregenerate do oppo&s;e the tendency of tho&s;e means whereby the Spirit &s;trives with them, ina&s;much as the&s;e are in their own na|ture fitted to lead them to a &s;aving conver&s;ion, it will not follow, that a &s;inner may not &s;o comply with, and improve that grace which he has re|ceived, as that there may be rea&s;on to hope, from the word of God, that he will receive further &s;up|plies. The regenerate do always in this world re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;o that the means which are u&s;ed with them for their &s;anctification, have not that effect, which in their own nature they tend unto. Were it not for this, they would be perfectly holy in heart and life. But it will not be denyed, that they may &s;o improve that grace which is given to them, as that they may take encouragement from the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, to hope and tru&s;t that he who has begun a good work, will carry it to perfection; and that in the way of waiting upon God, they &s;hall renew their &s;trength, through continued &s;upplies of the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be remembred, that it is the ordi|nary method of the Spirit to work upon the &s;ouls of men, with and by the outward means of grace. It is by the word of truth, as the in&s;trument, that &s;inners are awakened, enlightned, humbled and converted. They therefore who diligently attend thereto, are in this re&s;pect in the way of receiving divine aids and influences, and of having them continued and increa&s;ed; and on the contrary, they who neglect the outward means, do thereby
<PB N="117" REF="010643_0116_0F81BCFAD1ED7658">
keep them&s;elves, as it were, out of the way of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. The heathen are more unlikely to enjoy the &s;alutary beams of the &s;un of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, than we on whom it is ri&s;en. And be|cau&s;e they have not the outward means of divine knowledge, they are in &s;cripture &s;poken of as far off from God. And with equal truth it may be &s;aid, that where the chri&s;tian religion is profe&s;&s;ed, and its ordinances admini&s;tred, they who through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s will not improve their &s;piritual privi|leges, and &s;o continue in gro&s;s ignorance and wickedne&s;s, are farther from the kingdom of God, than they who &s;eriou&s;ly and diligently improve them. As the Spirit is wont to enlighten, hum|ble and convert men only by and with the word, &s;o they only to whom the word is &s;ent, and who attend unto it, are in any probability of knowing the truth, and turning from darkne&s;s to light. How clearly &s;oever the light &s;hines round a man, if he keeps him&s;elf always &s;hut up in the dark, he will not enjoy the benefit of its influence, any more than if the &s;un were not ri&s;en upon the earth. Nor will any other means, with which the Spirit u&s;eth to work, be of any better effect, any farther than they are attended to by us. Upon the whole, our conduct in this ca&s;e is of mo&s;t impor|tant con&s;equence, and according as we improve the grace we have received, there is rea&s;on to con|clude that it will either be continued &amp; increa&s;ed, or &s;u&s;pended and withdrawn. But it is time to proceed to the third enquiry, viz.</P>
<P N="3">3. ARE any endeavours or exertments of a &s;inner conducive to his being in a more de&s;irable and hopeful &s;tate, in regard of his inward di&s;po|&s;itions and qualifications?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="010643_0117_0F81BCFB8FE17DA0">I ANSWER, this point is already in effect de|termined, if the rea&s;oning above be ju&s;t. For it has been proved at large, that &s;ome who have not yet attained to the &s;tate of regeneration and con|ver&s;ion, may be nearer thereto than others, in the di&s;po&s;ition of their minds, and are therefore more likely to obtain that faith and repentance with which &s;alvation is connected. It has al&s;o been proved, that the&s;e preparatory di&s;po&s;itions are wrought in us by the power of the word and Spi|rit. And that our conduct is of important con|&s;ideration with re&s;pect to our having the outward means of grace, and inward influences of the Spirit&mdash;It follows then plainly from the&s;e prin|ciples, that tho&s;e inward effects of the word and Spirit which are now under con&s;ideration, have a like connection with, and dependance upon our conduct. Without &s;ome exerci&s;e of our active faculties, we &s;hall never, under&s;tand the doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel, nor be duly convinced that we have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God, nor have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the danger and mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of guilt and condemnation, nor ca&s;t about in our minds whether there be any way, of &s;alvation, and what ground of hope there is for one in &s;uch a ca&s;e, nor &s;hall we look to heaven for that help which none but God can give us. Such a work of conviction is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the &s;oul for the grace revealed in the go&s;pel; and it is not effected without our active concurrence, in at|tending to the ordinary means whereby the Holy Spirit worketh in the minds of men.</P>
<P>IT may be added, that our own experience and ob&s;ervation further confirms the truth of what has been above argued. By complying carefully
<PB N="119" REF="010643_0118_0F81BCFC4C4B3B68">
with the dictates of con&s;cience, it will become more tender and perceptive.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Earne&s;tne&s;s of mind and diligence of endeavour, tend to promote each other.

<P>THE effects of the Spirit's agency in and upon our hearts will be more &s;en&s;ibly perceived, in &s;ome proportion to our care to improve that grace, and tho&s;e means of grace which we are favoured with. Every one who has attended with care to the &s;tate and frame of his own mind mu&s;t, I believe, acknow|ledge, that if he has at any time attended with &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and diligence on the means of grace, and cheri&s;hed the motions, of God's Spirit in and with them, it has commonly been followed with &s;ome &s;en&s;ible effect on his mind and conver&s;ation. He has found &s;ome check given to his vain and &s;inful pur&s;uits, and a conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of mind|ing his &s;oul's concerns, and &s;ecuring the things of his eternal peace, has been more deeply imprinted on his mind and heart. And they who have worn off tho&s;e &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions which they have &s;ome|times had, I doubt not, have a witne&s;s in their con|&s;cience again&s;t them&s;elves, that they have often re|&s;i&s;ted and quenched the Spirit &s;triving with them, by indulging to &s;loth, wilful &s;in, love of the world, and vain amu&s;ements. As believers by improving the grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded to them, receive fre&s;h &s;upplies, whereby they make progre&s;s in the work of &s;anctification, &s;o the awakened &s;inner, who improves the &s;trength and influence communicated to him by God in and with his ordinances, &s;hall

<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed to offer in confirmation of the &s;econd part of this argument, that what renders the &s;tate of one man more hope|ful than that of another, is ordinarily connected with human endeavours, in a diligent u&s;e of the outward means of grace. And hence the conclu&s;ion is plain and undeniable, that &s;inners are encouraged, as well as bound in duty, to labour for the meat which en|dureth unto everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>IF no more could be offered for the encourage|ment of &s;inners in &s;eeking &s;alvation than what has been in&s;i&s;ted on, this ought in all rea&s;on to de|termine their re&s;olution, and animate their endea|vours. But we may go further and &s;ay, that it is in the way of attending the in&s;tituted means of grace that faith, and all the benefits of redemption there|with connected are obtained. I have been &s;hewing that it is by the Spirit's concurrence with our active endeavours, that we acquire &s;uch degrees of doctri|nal knowledge, conviction of &s;in, concern about de|liverance, &amp;c. as are requi&s;ite to prepare us to give a due entertainment to the grace of God revealed in the go&s;pel. And that none but they who are thus previou&s;ly enlightned, awakened and humbled, do receive and acquie&s;ce in the me&s;&s;age of life and peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And of con&s;equence, &s;uch are more likely than others to partake of this grace and &s;alvation. But it is to be added for the further encouragement of human endeavours, that it is in the way of attending the pre&s;cribed means of grace that the &s;aving benefits of redemption are ordinarily

obtained by &amp; applied to us. It is by our attending the preaching of the word, in particular, that we obtain faith, according to the expre&s;s words of the Apo&s;tle. "It is of the incorruptible &s;eed of the word of God, that we are born again."</P>
<P>SHOULD it be objected, that however the word may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be the means of faith and con|ver&s;ion, yet there is no room for any endeavours of ours in order to obtain it. For a &s;inner is wholly pa&s;&s;ive in hearing under&s;tanding and believing the report of the go&s;pel. I would an&s;wer.&mdash;That it is a commanded duty that &s;inners &s;hould attend to the preaching of the word, as &s;hall be proved in its pro|per place. That they are capable of obeying this and &s;uch-like commands in &s;ome manner, even from a regard to the authority of God.&mdash;That the&s;e commands were given as a motive to obedience.&mdash;And that whatever is done in obedience to a com|mand, ever implies &s;ome active exerci&s;e of the fa|culties. So that however pa&s;&s;ive the mind may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the very in&s;tance of believing, yet we may be and are active in hearing, which is a nece&s;&s;ary prerequi&s;ite and condition of faith. I might further &s;ay, that the &s;cripture notion of ju&s;ti|fying faith, con&s;idered &s;ubjectively, is more than a pa&s;&s;ive perception. But to propo&s;e and vindicate the evidence of this truth, would require more room than can here be allowed for an incidental point: Nor does our argument require us to di&s;pute this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that we have plain &s;cripture to a&s;&s;ure us, that in the times of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, human endeavours were the way in which men obtained faith, and entred into the kingdom of God. We have to this pur|po&s;e

They denote a &s;trong de&s;ire, and earne&s;t endeavour. In this manner &s;in|ners then entred into the kingdom of God; into a &s;tate of grace and acceptance with him. They &s;truggled and contended re&s;olutely for &s;alvation, and like &s;oldiers &s;torming a city, or forcing an entrench|ment, they &s;trove as it were who &s;hould be the fir&s;t to ru&s;h in. And the account which the in&s;pired hi&s;torian gives of the &s;ucce&s;s of Paul's preaching a|mong the Bereans, is worthy of &s;pecial remark.&mdash;<HI>The&s;e were more noble than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica, in that they received the word with all readine&s;s of mind, and &s;earched the &s;criptures daily whether tho&s;e things were &s;o: Therefore many of them believed.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. 17.11.</NOTE> They u&s;ed the appointed means to under&s;tand the nature and evidences of the chri&s;tian doctrine: This is recorded with a particular commendation; and it was owing to this, as the hi&s;torian informs us, that &s;o many believed.</P>
<P>IN this manner men were converted to the faith and obedience of the go&s;pel, under the preaching of John Bapti&s;t, Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles. And if it be enquired concerning tho&s;e, who have in every &s;ucceeding age given the be&s;t evidences of &s;incerity in their profe&s;&s;ions of faith in, and obedience to Chri&s;t, how they were called out of darkne&s;s into God's marvellous light, and tran&s;lated from the

Thus they have been led into all that know|ledge of, and &s;atisfaction in the go&s;pel, and the way of &s;alvation therein delineated, to which they have attained. If we con&s;ider the accounts, which the mo&s;t exemplary profe&s;&s;ors of the chri&s;tian religion have given of the manner of their conver&s;ion, we &s;hall find them thus far agreed, how much &s;oever they may differ in other circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>FROM the whole that has been offered under this argument, may I not venture to &s;ay, it is evident, that they who labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life, in the manner which has been declared, are much more likely to obtain it, than they who wilfully de&s;pi&s;e it, and put far from their thoughts the things of their eternal peace. To deny this will, I think, unavoidably run us into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>IF the diligent improvement of the means of grace (as we commonly &s;peak) has no &s;ort of con|ducivene&s;s to mens obtaining of &s;alvation, it is then no priviledge to be in the way of the&s;e means, and they who are brought up and live all their days a|mong the &s;avages of Africa, have as de&s;irable a lot, as we who are born in a chri&s;tian land, educated in the profe&s;&s;ion of the true religion, having the &s;crip|tures in our hands, with liberty and capacity to read them, and the go&s;pel faithfully preached to us.&mdash;For the outward means will be of no advantage to

any one who will not attend to and improve them. How plainly &s;oever the truth with its evidences may be declared, no man will be the wi&s;er or better or happier for it, unle&s;s he can be &s;ome way per|&s;uaded to exerci&s;e his active faculties, in con&s;idering and judging of the&s;e things, and applying them to him&s;elf, that he may &s;ee his own per&s;onal concern in them. To per&s;uade and enable a &s;inner to at|tend unto and u&s;e the outward means of faith and conver&s;ion, is the fir&s;t work of the Holy Spirit; and is the foundation of every con&s;equent effect wrought in the &s;oul by the influence of the word and Spirit of God.

For though it does not directly militate a|gain&s;t our rea&s;oning under this head, yet it tends to weaken its per&s;ua&s;ive force, and damp the zeal of mens endeavours.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, That &s;ince there are no promi&s;es of &s;alvation or effectual grace, to any thing wrought in or done by a &s;inner before he &s;avingly believes in Chri&s;t, he may notwith&s;tanding all his endea|vours, and all that light and conviction, and refor|mation, to which an unregenerate man may attain, peri&s;h at la&s;t with hypocrites and unbelievers: And then not only all his pains will be lo&s;t, but his guilt and puni&s;hment will thereby be greatly inhanced. That grace which was in&s;ufficient for his conver&s;ion, will &s;ubject him to a more fearful doom than he would have been liable to, if he had always lived in ignorance, and a carele&s;s neglect of religion.&mdash;There &s;eems therefore to be but &s;mall encourage|ment for an unregenerate man to &s;trive for &s;alvation, upon &s;uch uncertainty of &s;ucce&s;s, when there is &s;o much danger that his ca&s;e will hereby be rendred more deplorable.&mdash;I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>

For as long as a &s;inner lives, he is trea&s;uring up to him&s;elf wrath a|gain&s;t the day of wrath, unle&s;s the goodne&s;s of God leads him to repentance. But who except a mad man would think it prudent, to involve him&s;elf in certain and immediate guilt, to avoid that which is only po&s;&s;ible, and chu&s;e certain perdition, rather than a probable hope of &s;alvation.

How do we know that mens refu&s;ing the knowledge of God's ways is not as offen&s;ive to him, or will not receive as many and heavy &s;tripes, as if they had known his will and not done it?

Says Chri&s;t to the unbelieving Jews, of whom he te&s;tifies, <HI>that they would not come to him that they might have life; &s;earch the &s;criptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they that te&s;tify of me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 5.39.</NOTE> It was not certainly the primary de&s;ign of the&s;e words to in&s;truct believers in the duties of the cbri&s;tian life, but to recommend to unbelievers the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, as means of obtaining faith in Chri&s;t. For to him all the prophets gave wit|ne&s;s, and if they would receive their te&s;timony, they could not rea&s;onably reject him.</P>
<P>GOD has al&s;o commanded men in a &s;tate of &s;in to remember, and con&s;ider tho&s;e things which he declares and &s;peaks to them. <HI>Remember now and &s;hew your&s;elves men, bring it again to mind O ye tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 46.8.</NOTE> And the P&s;almi&s;t having declared the awful doom of the wicked, the judgment which God will pronounce and execute upon them, con|cludes with a &s;olemn admonition to &s;uch, that they attend to it, and lay it to heart. <HI>Con&s;ider this ye

that forget God, le&s;t I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</HI> Here is a plain command to &s;inners to reflect and meditate &s;eriou&s;ly upon the &s;olemn truths revealed in the word of God, and &s;uffer them to &s;ink deep into their heart, and inti|mation that this is a means of their e&s;caping the de&s;truction, with which they are threatned.</P>
<P>THAT prayer is a duty enjoined on the uncon|verted, appears from the words of Peter to Simon the magician. That he was a wicked man, in the judgment of the apo&s;tle, no one can doubt, who attends to the apo&s;tle's words. <HI>Thou ha&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right with God. I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and bond of iniquity.</HI> Yet he ex|horts him to <HI>pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him.</HI> Should it be pre|tended that he was not directed to pray unle&s;s he fir&s;t repented &s;incerely, &s;o was converted: I an&s;wer, though it was doubtle&s;s his duty to repent of his &s;in with godly &s;orrow, and pray in true faith, yet we cannot conclude from the order of the words, that he was not bound and encouraged to pray, unle&s;s he fir&s;t was a true penitent and believer. Yea the apo&s;tle's words obviou&s;ly intimate the contrary.&mdash;For there is a &s;ure promi&s;e of pardon to all that re|pent in godly &s;incerity, and pray in faith. Such &s;hall <HI>without peradventure</HI> be forgiven: Whereas the apo&s;tle's words, "pray to God IF PERHAPS the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee," im|ply that it was his duty and wi&s;dom to pray for pardon, though he &s;hould not do it with that repentance and faith which has a certain connection with forgivene&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. 8.21.22, 23.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="010643_0134_0F81BD0D9BCE6498">AND our text &s;o expre&s;ly requires &s;inners to u&s;e endeavours for obtaining &s;alvation, that with it I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e &s;cripture te&s;timonies. <HI>Labour not for the meat that peri&s;heth, but for that which en|dureth to everla&s;ting life.</HI> But the&s;e words have al|ready been &s;ufficiently opened, and their pertinency to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, &s;hewn at large in the intro|duction, which I &s;hall not here repeat. To the&s;e direct proofs, I will add two or three con&s;equential arguments, and &s;o fini&s;h this head.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures teach us, that they who will not improve their &s;piritual privileges, &s;hall be &s;everely puni&s;hed for &s;uch neglect. When Je&s;us &s;ent his apo&s;tles to preach the go&s;pel,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 10:14, 15.</NOTE> he &s;aid to them, <HI>Who&s;oever will not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that hou&s;e or city, &s;hake off the du&s;t of your feet: Verily I &s;ay unto you, it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</HI> If any to whom the call of the go&s;pel is &s;ent will not hear it, nor attend to it, their refu&s;al will be charged to them as their great &s;in, and will procure them a mo&s;t intolerable puni&s;hment. It is then a plain and cer|tain con&s;equence, that it is the duty of &s;inners to attend to the means of grace. No one &s;urely would be threatned, and puni&s;hed, for not doing what he was not required to do.</P>
<P>THIS may be al&s;o inferred from God's giving mankind a revelation of his will, and appointing out|ward means for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners. When God &s;peaks to men, it is certainly their duty to be attentive. His in&s;tituting the ordinance of preach|ing, infers the duty of hearing. There is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary connection between them. Now it is cer|tain,
<PB N="136" REF="010643_0135_0F81BD0D023CCCB8">
that the coun&s;els and in&s;tructions of God's word are addre&s;&s;ed to unrenewed &s;inners, as well as &s;aints. The preaching of the go&s;pel is, by the appointment of God, a converting, as well as edifying ordinance. It is therefore the duty of the unconverted to attend thereto; otherwi&s;e they turn away from God, who in his word is calling and &s;peaking to them from heaven, &s;o oppo&s;e his will, and condemn his au|thority.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the obligation of &s;inners to attend to the ordinary means of grace, may be inferred from God's commanding them to believe, and repent. <HI>This is the work of God,</HI> "that is the work which he requires of us," (&s;o Dr. Owen paraphra&s;es the words) <HI>that we &s;hould believe on him whom he hath &s;ent.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.29.</NOTE> This is his commandment, that we &s;hould be|lieve on the name of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 3.23.</NOTE> Je&s;us preached the go&s;pel, &s;aying, the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand, repent ye and believe the go&s;pel.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mark 1.14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>God hath now commanded all men every where to repent.</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Acts 17.31.</NOTE> <HI>Repent and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Acts 3.19.</NOTE> But the &s;criptures teach us that faith, repentance, and conver&s;ion, are ordinarily no otherwi&s;e obtained, than by attending to the pre&s;cribed means of grace. <HI>Faith cometh by hearing,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.17.</NOTE> So does repentance. <HI>If they hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets,</HI> (&s;ays Abraham in the para|ble) <HI>neither will they be per&s;uaded</HI> (to repent) <HI>though one aro&s;e from the dead</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Luk. 16.31.</NOTE> Con&s;ideration is al&s;o a means of conver&s;ion. <HI>I thought on my ways</HI> (&s;ays David) <HI>and turned my feet into thy te&s;timonies</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 119.59.</NOTE>&mdash;When therefore we are commanded to believe, re|pent, and turn to God, we are virtually, and by

nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, commanded to u&s;e tho&s;e means, or ob&s;erve tho&s;e in&s;trumental duties, where|by faith and repentance are obtained. God in re|quiring any duty, does thereby require whatever is nece&s;&s;ary on our part, in order to the performance of it.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has been &s;aid to make it appear, that the duties are in the word of God enjoined on the unregenerate; which was the fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed. So I pa&s;s to the&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. TO &s;hew at follows from hence, that they are bound, and encouraged to a practical attendance un|to the&s;e duties. It will not be denyed that it is the duty of all to obey the commands of God, and ob|&s;erve all the ordinances he has pre&s;cribed to them. Nor will it be denyed that believers have encourage|ments, as well as obligation to obedience. I &s;up|po&s;e it will al&s;o be acknowledged on all hands, that &s;inners are bound and encouraged, to believe in the &s;on of God, and then yield the obedience of faith, to the&s;e and all other precepts of the go&s;pel. So I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon the proof of the&s;e things. But the great point which is here to be enquired into is, Whether the&s;e commands oblige and encourage men to obedience, while they are de&s;titute of &s;av|ing faith and the grace of regeneration?</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer, that &s;uch obedience to the&s;e commands, as &s;inners are capable of antecedent to faith and regeneration, is required and encouraged in the&s;e precepts. It is required, becau&s;e as to the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of the performance it is good, and agreable to the divine precept. Though it be not the whole requirement of the command, yet it is part of what is required; con&s;equently carries an obligation of obedience with it. It is required, becau&s;e the neglect and omi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub&s;tance of
<PB N="138" REF="010643_0137_0F81BD10B33475A0">
commanded duties, as well as the want of right principles is &s;in, and as &s;uch is &s;everely threatned and puni&s;hed by God. Every one is commanded to depart from evil as well as do good: And &s;uch actions as are materially as well as formally contrary to God's commands, are every way evil. And finally it is required, becau&s;e it is the way &amp; means, in attendance to which faith and a new heart are ordinarily obtained. When therefore &s;inners are commanded to believe, and repent, they are by nece&s;&s;ary implication commanded to attend the means of faith and repentance.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uch obedience to the&s;e commands as men are capable of before regeneration and &s;aving faith, <HI>is also encouraged.</HI> All the precepts which God has given to mankind in his word, were de|&s;igned not only to make them know their duty, but al&s;o influence them to practi&s;e it. The end of God's giving commands to men, has always been to encourage, as well as bind them to obedience. They are founded upon a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace; &s;o are de&s;igned and adapted to &s;ub&s;erve this won|derful plan of divine mercy. And this is encou|ragement enough to &s;inful men to endeavour a compliance with them. It is al&s;o a great encou|ragement to a diligent improvement of the privile|ges and gracious influences which God vouch&s;afes to &s;inners, that this is the way to have them con|tinued and encrea&s;ed: For who&s;oever improves what he hath, to him &s;hall be given. Acts of re|ligious obedience performed by the unregenerate; though defective and unholy, tend to and often i&s;&s;ue in their everla&s;ting good Hereby they are with-held from many &s;ins, kept in the way of God's ble&s;&s;ing, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means by which faith is
<PB N="139" REF="010643_0138_0F81BD120DA685A8">
obtained. But in order to clear up and vindicate the evidence of this propo&s;ition, <HI>that &s;inners are bound and encouraged, by the commands of God in his word, to &s;eek &s;alvation, in the way of attendance to the pre&s;cribed means of grace, even while they are de&s;titute of that faith and repentance which is unto life,</HI> it will be proper that we con&s;ider the &s;everal ways in which &s;ome have endeavoured to evade this conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be &s;aid, all unbelievers are under the covenant of works. And therefore all the obliga|tions of duty which they are under, are only the obligations of a covenant requiring perfect obedi|ence as the condition of life. Though it be their duty to read and hear and pray, &s;ince God has commanded the&s;e things, yet till they are &s;et free from the law by being married to Chri&s;t by faith, there is no other obligation or encouragement to endeavour obedience in the&s;e in&s;tances, than there is to keep all the commandments with &s;inle&s;s per|fection, in order to ju&s;tification. Tis vain to urge duties on men, while under the law, as a covenant of life, unle&s;s we will inculcate perfect obedience to the law of works. But &s;ince no man is able to ob|tain ju&s;tification and eternal life in this way, though obedience is the duty of unbelievers, yet there is no encouragement to any attempts in this way. In oppo&s;ition to this I undertake to prove,</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e duties, which in the word of God are required of fallen man, are not required upon the foundation of a covenant of works; or as in|cluded in the condition of a covenant of life, de|manding perfect obedience to the law of works, in order to ju&s;tification. I grant that the law of God obliges all mankind to ob&s;erve every command
<PB N="140" REF="010643_0139_0F81BD12CDA2E010">
which God is ever plea&s;ed to give them. Our di&s;obeying any divine precept, even the po&s;itive precepts of the go&s;pel, is truly a breach of the law, and puni&s;hable as &s;uch. But what is here a&s;&s;erted is, that the END of God's giving the&s;e commands to &s;inners, is not that any one &s;hould be ju&s;tified by his obedience to them; they do not belong to a covenant of works, requiring per|fect obedience to the law, as the condition of life: But they are given upon quite a different foun|dation, and for quite a different purpo&s;e. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT does not appear from &s;cripture, that perfect obedience to the moral law, or law of na|ture, ever was made the covenant condition of life to man. The word of God does not inform us, that Adam was put upon trial for life, under a covenant requiring perfect obedience to the whole moral law, as the condition of immortality: But the whole account we have of that primitive con&s;titution has quite a contrary appearance. I know many have &s;uppo&s;ed, that Adam was under &s;uch a covenant of works; but upon what grounds I know not. There is nothing in &s;crip|ture to build &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition upon that ever I could find; and we can know nothing about this matter beyond what we are taught by revelation. The condition of life was ab&s;taining from the for|bidden fruit. No other is mentioned, or inti|mated. Had our fir&s;t parents been obedient in this in&s;tance, they and their po&s;terity had been hereby ju&s;tified, and inherited immortal life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>By the account we have of this matter in &s;cripture, the death or life of our fir&s;t parents, and their off|&s;pring, was wholly put upon their eating or for|bearing to eat the forbidden fruit. The law of nature is not, that I know of, any where mention|ed as a part of this covenant tran&s;action. The tenor of this covenant in its fir&s;t exhibition was, <HI>in the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> And accordingly after the fall, God only demands of Adam, who told thee that thou wa&s;t naked? Ha&s;t thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou &s;hould&s;t not eat? Agreable to this we find the &s;entence was inflicted on Adam for this cau&s;e, without mention of any other, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t eaten of the tree,</Q> &amp;c. <BIBL><HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> on Original Sin, &s;ee pag. 93-96.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="010643_0140_0F81BD13947CA4E8">BUT it may be a&s;ked, would they not have fal|len under condemnation, if they had committed any other &s;in? I an&s;wer, if they had believed God, and not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed that po&s;itive prohibi|tion, which was the condition of life to them, we have no rea&s;on to think that they would have &s;in|ned in any other in&s;tance; but by the providence and grace of God, they would have been pre|&s;erved from the prevailing power of every other temptation. In other words, they would have been confirmed in a &s;tate of &s;inle&s;s rectitude, as a reward of their obedience in that in&s;tance, upon which the promi&s;e of life was &s;u&s;pended; in like manner as the &s;aints in heaven will be confirmed in holine&s;s, through the favour of God, in con&s;e|quence of their being ju&s;tified, and intitled to e|ternal life, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;econd Adam Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) WHATEVER covenant man was under before his fall, it laid no obligations of obedi|ence, <HI>as a covenant,</HI> after it was broken. And that for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e a covenant is at an end as &s;oon as it is broken, unle&s;s it be renewed. Mankind are indeed bound to &s;uffer the penalty their breach of covenant was threatned with. But it would be gro&s;ly ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="142" REF="010643_0141_0F81BD1468C4AD10">
that after a covenant was effectually broken, and its promi&s;e irrecoverably forfeited, man &s;hould yet be bound by virtue of it to fulfil the duty therein required, in order thereby to obtain ju&s;ti|fication &amp; eternal life. The covenant with Adam, as Mr. Stoddard has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, was at an end, upon his eating the forbidden fruit. After this it had no further commands upon him. The obligation he was now under, by virtue of this con&s;titution, was not to do, but to &s;uffer. So that if Adam were &s;uppo&s;ed to be a probationer for immortality under a covenant of works, or upon condition of perfect obedience to the law of nature, yet I think it cannot and will not be pre|tended, that after he had &s;inned, broken covenant, and he with his po&s;terity were condemned to die, he was &s;till a probationer for life on the terms of &s;inle&s;s obedience, by virtue of this primitive con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it will now be enquired, are not &s;in|ners then bound to keep the law? Does their fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;et them at liberty ever after from all obligations of duty or active obedience? I an&s;wer, every man is doubtle&s;s eternally oblig|ed to keep the law of God. For the law is a perfect unchangeable rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, en|joined by the authority of God our maker and &s;overeign. Tho' &s;in expo&s;es us to puni&s;hment, it does not loo&s;e our obligations to obey for time to come. But we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the divine law as a rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a cove|nant of life. This &s;eems not to have been at|tended to by &s;ome, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ought. We are always bound to obey the law; but we are no longer bound to keep a covenant that while it is in
<PB N="143" REF="010643_0142_0F81BD1507425E30">
force: And it is no longer in force after it is broken. We may illu&s;trate this di&s;tinction by the following &s;imile. Suppo&s;e a man &s;hould co|venant with his &s;ervant, that if he would &s;erve him faithfully for a limited rime, &s;ay a year, he would then give him his liberty, and a &s;ettlement for life: But if he was unfaithful, he &s;hould not only forfeit and lo&s;e the&s;e privileges, but be cha|&s;ti&s;ed according to his de&s;erts. It is plain he is now put upon probation for liberty by virtue of this covenant, and con&s;equently is bound to faith|fulne&s;s by the promi&s;e and threatning. But &s;up|po&s;e he &s;hould be unfaithful, and &s;teal from his ma&s;ter what he was forbidden to take, the cove|nant would now be broken, the promi&s;e utterly void, and he would be expo&s;ed to de&s;erved pu|ni&s;hment. In this ca&s;e, every one &s;ees that he is no longer upon probation, nor is he any longer bound to faithfulne&s;s under the notion of fulfill|ing the condition of a covenant. That is plainly impo&s;&s;ible. Yet he will &s;till be bound to obedi|ence and faithfulne&s;s, becau&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under obligations to his ma&s;ter, di&s;tinct from, and antecedent to this particular agreement.&mdash;The&s;e therefore remain upon him in full force. Thus the divine law binds man to obedience, ab&s;tract from the con&s;ideration of any covenant tran&s;action. Had there never been any &s;uch tran&s;action, man would have been obliged in duty to love and obey God. And after he had broken the covenant which God had made with him, &s;o the promi&s;e was forfeited, &s;till it was his duty to love and obey God. Yet 'tis plainly ab&s;urd to imagine, that duties are &s;till required of him up|on the foundation of a covenant which is broken effectually, and &s;o is at an end. If we do not
<PB N="144" REF="010643_0143_0F81BD1609228810">
duly attend to the di&s;tinction between a duty re|quired by law, and a condition annexed to a co|venant, we cannot rightly apprehend the nature and ground of obligations to duty.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) MANKIND have never &s;ince the original lap&s;e been put upon probation for life under a covenant of works. They have never been re|quired to obey the law perfectly, as the covenant condition of life. The whole account we have in the &s;criptures, of God's dealings with fallen man, is plainly contrary to this notion. Immediately after the fall of man, a promi&s;e of the Saviour was given, and another con&s;titution, incon&s;i&s;tent with the impleaded &s;uppo&s;ition, was e&s;tabli&s;hed and revealed, even before &s;entence was pa&s;t upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. The covenant with Noah con|tains no intimations of &s;uch a covenant of works. The Abrahamic covenant was a covenant of pro|mi&s;e or grace, by the expre&s;s te&s;timony of the a|po&s;tle. The Sinai covenant was I grant in &s;ome re&s;pects a covenant of works. And by the way it was this covenant, that in the new te&s;tament is called the fir&s;t or old covenant, in oppo&s;ition to that new covenant of which Chri&s;t is the medi|ator; and not any covenant of works with Adam, or with mankind in general. Every one who will be at the pains to examine the &s;everal places where the word occurs, will I think be immediately &s;en|&s;ible of this. But tis certain that God never in|tended, in this national covenant with the children of I&s;rael, to propo&s;e to them a way of obtaining ju&s;tification, and eternal life by their own works of righteou&s;ne&s;s The rewards of obedience were temporal ble&s;&s;ings, which however were &s;ub|&s;ervient to their obtaining ble&s;&s;ings &s;piritual and
<PB N="145" REF="010643_0144_0F81BD16B9519580">
eternal. For by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the land of promi&s;e, they had not only a fruitful country to live in, but al&s;o lived in the valley of vi&s;ion, where were much greater advantages and privileges of a &s;piritual na|ture, than any others enjoyed. While this cove|nant was in force, they were indeed ju&s;tified before God as their political king, by their own works.&mdash;See Deut. 6.24, 25. But with regard to a title to eternal life, no one was ever ju&s;tified by his obed|ience to the precepts of this national covenant. For if eternal life had been to be obtained in this way, the covenant of grace which had been revealed to Abra|ham (and I may &s;ay to Adam) long before, mu&s;t of con&s;equence have been annulled; the contrary to which is &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted and proved by Paul, in di&s;puting again&s;t the judaizing chri&s;tians.&mdash;(See Gal. 3.15, 17.) &s;ays he, <HI>Brethren, I &s;peak after the manner of men, though it be a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man di&s;annulleth or addeth thereto. And this I &s;ay, that the covenant of God in Chri&s;t, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot di&s;annul, that it &s;hould make the promi&s;e of none effect.</HI> Be&s;ides, the Sinai covenant was given only to one nation. The Gentiles were never re|quired to ob&s;erve it. Did Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles then propo&s;e a covenant of works, requiring per|fect obedience to the law as the condition of ju&s;ti|fication and life? This will hardly be pretended. Upon the whole, the &s;criptures no where inform us, that mankind have &s;ince the original lap&s;e been put upon probation for life under a covenant, requiring perfect per&s;onal obedience, as its condition, what|ever were the &s;tate of man before the fall: Yea I think the &s;uppo&s;ition of God's putting man under &s;uch a covenant, in his pre&s;ent depraved &s;tate, is &s;carce reconcileable with divine wi&s;dom. It is then

certain that the commands and exhortations to duty, which we find in the &s;criptures, are none of them on the foundation of a covenant of works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.12. Lev. 18.5. "The man that doth the&s;e things &s;hall live in them." The&s;e words are evidently to be referred to the Sinai law, which was a covenant of works, but contained no promi&s;es of eternal life to obedience. The error of the Jews and judaizers, which the Apo&s;tle di&s;putes again&s;t, was, that ju&s;tification, and a title to eternal life, were to be obtained by obedience to the Sinai covenant. The Apo&s;tle's argument imports, that this could not be, becau&s;e the Sinai covenant was a law or covenant of works, whereas the &s;criptures teach plainly that man|kind have from the beginning been ju&s;tified and &s;aved by faith. The covenant of promi&s;e was before the covenant of Sinai; &s;o could not be annulled by it. The law was given for other ends, Mat. 19.17. Je&s;us &s;aid to the young ruler, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." And to the lawyer, Luk. 10.28. "This do and thou &s;halt live." Obedience to the commands of God, has in the go&s;pel a promi&s;e of eternal life. "Without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." And "ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his command|ments, that they may have a right to the tree of life." But this does not imply that our obedience may be our ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s. The promi&s;e of life is on the foundation of the covenant of grace: Nor is there any holy obedience: without faith in Chri&s;t, the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;See Henry's expo&s;ition. The law requires duty, the go&s;pel promi&s;es eternal re|ward to the works of faith and love, and declares that without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. If we love God and our neighbour, we &s;hall have eternal life, not by the law, which contains no promi&s;e of eternal life upon any condition whatever, but by that faith which has wrought by love. And without faith we have no holy love to God or our neighbour. Indeed the young ruler and lawyer, it &s;eems, were under the &s;ame mi&s;take, &s;o common among the Jews at that time, viz. that upon the foundation of the Sinai covenant, which was a covenant of works, eternal life was obtainable by obedience to the law, &s;o they might be ju&s;tified by their own righteou&s;ne&s;s. And nothing could be bet|ter &s;uited to give an effectual wound to the very root of this &s;elf-righteous fancy, than to lead them to a ju&s;t view of the breadth of the divine law, in the &s;pirit and not in the letter. And this appears plainly to be the &s;cope and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's an&s;wers to them. They could not but be con&s;cious that their obedience had been defective: Yea that they had not obeyed one command in the true &s;pirit and extent of it, upon their having ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the divine law; con&s;equently mu&s;t fall under its cur&s;e. But to &s;et the&s;e things in a ju&s;t light, a full di&s;&s;ertation would be nece&s;&s;ary, in&s;tead of a &s;hort incidental note.&mdash;Upon the whole, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on to infer from the&s;e texts, or any other, that mankind are, previous to their believing in Chri&s;t, under &s;uch a covenant of works as &s;ome have pretended; much le&s;s that they are under a con&s;titution promi&s;ing pardon and eternal life to peni|tent unbelievers, without their being indebted to Chri&s;t, or the grace of the go&s;pel. And it is an ea&s;y, but I think a needle&s;s ta&s;k, to &s;hew that all tho&s;e texts of &s;cripture, which have been quoted in confirmation of this notion, have been quite mi&s;under&s;tood. Be&s;ides, that &s;uch a con&s;titution would be contrary to the co|venant of grace, it would be repugnant I conceive to the divine perfections. For, as Mr. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">kine &s;ays, in his di&s;&s;ertation on the Sinai covenant, <Q>To &s;uppo&s;e God formally entring into a covenant, the condition of which he knew could not po&s;&s;ibly be performed, is a &s;hocking ab&s;urdity.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="147" REF="010643_0146_0F81BD1B123B7EE8">(4.) SUPPOSING perfect per&s;onal obedience would intitle a man to eternal life, yet God's end and de|&s;ign in pre&s;cribing duty to men in his word, was not to direct and require them to work out a legal righteou&s;ne&s;s, whereby they might be ju&s;tified. The divine commands in &s;cripture, we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> are not upon the foundation of a covenant of works,
<PB N="148" REF="010643_0147_0F81BD1BDA7A6970">
for this obvious rea&s;on, that men are con&s;idered and addre&s;&s;ed all along as &s;inners, actually &amp; practically &s;o. It is then as impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of things for &s;uch a one to be ju&s;tified by a perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s of his own, as it is for him to recall pa&s;t time, and cau&s;e that never to have been, which has been. "Con&s;ider this ye that forget God, le&s;t I tear you in pieces." Many other texts there are of the &s;ame import. They who forget God are by the law condemned already, &s;o cannot obtain eternal life by a covenant of works. It is too late to call upon condemned criminals to con&s;ider and beware of ca|pital crimes le&s;t they die, if perfect obedience be the only condition upon which they can live: And a covenant of works gives life upon no other condi|tion. The commands and coun&s;els of God to &s;in|ners, cannot without &s;hocking ab&s;urdity be referred to any &s;uch covenant. Be&s;ides, &s;uch commands as God has given to &s;inners, cannot po&s;&s;ibly belong to a covenant of works. It has no place or room for &s;uch duties as God calls men to, &s;uch as repentance, prayer for pardon, turning from &s;in to God, be|lieving on Chri&s;t and tru&s;ting in him for &s;alvation, attending the means of grace, &amp;c. The&s;e duties imply or pre&s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ubjects are &s;inners. Therefore the requirement of the&s;e things mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be upon the foundation or foot of &s;ome o|ther con&s;titution than a covenant of works, and for &s;ome other end than to obtain ju&s;tification and a title to eternal life by &s;inle&s;s obedience.</P>
<P N="2">2. I SHALL now proceed to con&s;ider another e|va&s;ion of the conclu&s;ion, pleaded for. It may be &s;aid, allowing that the&s;e commands to &s;inners do not &s;tand upon the foundation of a covenant of works, yet they are all comprehended in the divine law,
<PB N="149" REF="010643_0148_0F81BD1C8A5F4DD0">
who&s;e obligation lies upon every &s;oul. The law of nature obliges to obey every command of God, as &s;oon as it is made known to us: And therefore no man can tran&s;gre&s;s a po&s;itive precept, or an occa|&s;ional command, without breaking the law of na|ture, which requires godline&s;s and humanity to per|fection. But till &s;inners are ju&s;tified by faith, they are under the cur&s;e of the law; nor will their at|tempting to obey any divine command (however it be their duty) have the lea&s;t tendency to loo&s;e them from their obligation to puni&s;hment; much le&s;s will a meer &s;hadow of obedience which is abo|minable in the &s;ight of God. Therefore as all men who are not united to Chri&s;t by faith, are at the &s;ame time bound by the precept and the cur&s;e of the law, though it be their duty to keep all God's command, yet they have no other encouragement to hope to obtain eternal ble&s;&s;ings in this way, than the law will give: That is none at at all.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer. It is granted the obligation of the divine law is unchangeable: That &s;inners are bound to obey every command; Yet till ju&s;tified by faith they are obnoxious to the cur&s;e: And that the law though it requires duty, yet gives no hope of life to a &s;inner. Whatever encouragement then any one may have, to hope that his endeavours in a way of obedience to the divine commands may i&s;&s;ue in his eternal advantage, it mu&s;t be drawn from &s;ome other con&s;ideration, than barely his legal ob|ligation to duty. But yet it may be maintained, that every precept contained in God's word, was de&s;igned by God to be not only a declaration of duty to tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to it, but al&s;o to convey an encouraging motive to endeavours of obedience. If then there are any commands, exhortations and
<PB N="150" REF="010643_0149_0F81BD1D4E694520">
coun&s;els to men unregenerate in &s;cripture (as we have &s;een there are) then we may a&s;&s;uredly con|clude, not only that it is their duty to obey, but that there is encouragement thereunto; and that for this rea&s;on that all the&s;e commands, coun&s;els and exhortations, &s;tand upon the foundation of a gracious con&s;titution, which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;alvation of fallen man.&mdash;This important point I will fir&s;t prove, and then &s;hew that this con&s;ide|ration infers an encouraging motive to endeavours of obedience.</P>
<P>FIRST. The commands and exhortations to duty directed to the unregenerate in the holy &s;cripture, are founded upon a divine con&s;titution of grace, for the recovery and &s;alvation of fallen man. The re|velation of God's will to man, &s;tands intirely upon this ba&s;is, and is fitted and de&s;igned in every part to &s;ub&s;erve this wonderful &s;cheme of mercy. After the original apo&s;tacy God would have had no fur|ther commands on &s;inners, he would have pre&s;cri|bed no more duties to them by &s;upernatural reve|lation, had he not determined to treat with them on the foundation of a new and gracious covenant. The obvious &s;cope and tenor of the &s;criptures will clearly evidence, that God had a merciful de&s;ign in revealing therein his will to mankind. The fir&s;t revelation made to man after the fall contained a de|claration of grace, and in effect &s;et every thing which followed upon a new bottom. The media|torial di&s;pen&s;ation was hereby e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. Adam with all his po&s;terity became &s;o far the &s;ubjects of the mediatorial kingdom, that all the commands which they afterwards received from God, directing them in the great concerns of eternal life, were given through Chri&s;t, and upon the foun|dation
<PB N="151" REF="010643_0150_0F81BD1EB41F3360">
of his mediatorial undertaking: In other words, they were properly laws of the mediator&mdash;They were all founded upon that famous promi&s;e, (in Gen. 3.15.) <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall break the &s;erpent's head.</HI> All the &s;ub&s;equent revelations of God's will, which mankind were favoured with from time to time, always &s;uppo&s;ed that God had de&s;igns of mercy towards the human race. The divine oracles held forth this important truth, as it were in the fronti&s;piece, as the grand CAPITAL POINT to which the other parts referred, that the Son of God was to de&s;troy the work of the devil. This is the key of the bible, that opens to us the de&s;ign of the in&s;tructions, coun&s;els and commands, which God has given to man. They all belong to, and are founded upon that gracious con&s;titution which is here revealed; and are adapted and intended to &s;ub&s;erve this &s;cheme of divine mercy. And that this is true in particular of the duties pre&s;cribed to the unregenerate will appear, if we con&s;ider what the &s;criptures teach concerning the nature, and end of the&s;e requirements.</P>
<P>AS to the nature or matter of the duties required of &s;inners, it is in brief, that they attend to the call of the go&s;pel: con&s;ider the import and evidence of its doctrines and precepts; receive that conviction of &s;in and mi&s;ery which is there laid before them; look to heaven for mercy; behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world; believe on him; tru&s;t in him; love him; repent of &s;in, and &s;hew their faith, hope, love and repentance, by obedience to all his commands. I do not &s;ay that men are to do all the&s;e things while unregenerate: That would be plainly ab&s;urd. But &s;inners are re|quired to hear, and attend, and con&s;ider, and pray,
<PB N="152" REF="010643_0151_0F81BD1F2A2C3808">
and &s;trive, that they may believe, repent, and obey the go&s;pel. Now we may ob&s;erve, that all the&s;e things belong in due &s;ubordination to the means of &s;alvation, according to that gracious di&s;pen&s;ation which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. Since then God has pre&s;cribed to men, as matter of duty, the u&s;e of tho&s;e means, by which the benefits of redemp|tion are applied, and conveyed to the ve&s;&s;els of mercy; the requirement of the&s;e duties is doubtle&s;s upon the foundation of that gracious plan, which the performance of them is evidently fitted to &s;ub&s;erve.</P>
<P>AND this will be yet more manife&s;t, if we con&s;ider the end for which the&s;e duties are enjoined. If we can collect from &s;cripture what end they have rela|tion to, this will clearly determine the point. If the ends, to which the&s;e duties are &s;ubordinated, can have no place except upon the gracious con&s;titution beforementioned, then the requirement of duties for &s;uch ends &s;tands upon that foundation. Now it is certain, that &s;inners are commanded and exhorted to hear, and con&s;ider, and believe, and repent, &amp;c. in order to &s;alvation. And it is certain that &s;alva|tion is obtainable by &s;inners only upon the plan of grace.</P>
<P>WHEN Je&s;us in the text exhorts the Jews to la|bour for the meat which endureth to <HI>everla&s;ting life,</HI> it is obvious what end he directs their views to, and what their endeavours were required for, even ob|taining everla&s;ting life. When Peter directs the Sorcerer <HI>to pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven,</HI> the end for which he is di|rected to pray, was that he might obtain pardon. When God calls &s;ecure &s;inners to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> the doom of the wicked, <HI>le&s;t he tear them in pieces,</HI> the end why they are called to con&s;ideration, is plainly that
<PB N="153" REF="010643_0152_0F81BD1FE26FE330">
they may e&s;cape de&s;truction. When Abraham in the parable &s;ays to the rich man concerning his five brethren, <HI>they have Mo&s;es and the prophets let them hear them,</HI> the end why they were required to hear them, was that they might <HI>repent,</HI> &s;o <HI>not come to the place of torment.</HI> When Chri&s;t bids the unbe|lieving Jews <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures,</HI> which contain the words of <HI>eternal life becau&s;e they te&s;tify of him,</HI> it is not to be doubted that the end of this direction was, that they might be per&s;uaded by the te&s;timony of the &s;criptures to believe on him. Finally, when Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He that hath ears let him hear,</HI> we mu&s;t conclude that men are therefore commanded to hear the call of the go&s;pel, that they may <HI>under&s;tand and believe,</HI> &s;o <HI>be converted and healed.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears then, that the&s;e things are pre&s;cribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;inners, as means, in the u&s;e of which they are to &s;eek, and may obtain eternal life &amp; &s;alvation. God would not direct men to u&s;e means in order to an end, which they had no &s;ort of connection with, and were no way fitted to ob&s;erve. His pre&s;cribing duties to men in order to their obtaining &s;alvation, plainly implies or &s;uppo&s;es that &s;alvation is obtain|able. Con&s;equently the&s;e precepts are all upon the foundation of that gracious con&s;titution, according to which &s;inners may be pardoned and &s;aved. It is then an obvious inference, that the&s;e things are not required as the condition of a covenant of works, requiring perfect obedience to the law, in order to ju&s;tification: Nor are the&s;e commands mere decla|rations of law and duty, becau&s;e a &s;inner's future o|bedience to a law of works will not conduce at all to intitle him to eternal life in this way, however perfect we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e his obedience to be; be|cau&s;e his pa&s;t; guilt, which he can never expiate,
<PB N="154" REF="010643_0153_0F81BD20483C9CB0">
binds the cur&s;e upon him. And it is yet more e|vident, that defective and unholy performances will avail nothing to this end. God's requiring duties of &s;inners, in order to their e&s;caping his wrath and cur&s;e, and having everla&s;ting life, is a virtual decla|ration of grace and mercy:&mdash;Unle&s;s we will be &s;o profane as to charge God fooli&s;hly; and &s;ay that he pre&s;cribes means in order to an end, which they have no connection with, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uitablene&s;s for.&mdash;I proceed now to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If the&s;e commands which God has given to &s;inners belong to the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, or in other words are precepts of the go&s;pel, then they carry with them not only obligation, but en|couragement to endeavours of obedience.&mdash;For we may hence conclude, that God has de&s;igns of mer|cy towards fallen man; and it is in order to exe|cute and accompli&s;h his gracious purpo&s;es, that he &s;ends the call of his go&s;pel to tho&s;e who are peri&s;h|ing in their &s;ins, and requires them to hear and at|tend to it, to con&s;ider the import of his me&s;&s;age to them, and the evidence that is propo&s;ed to them, that it is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all accep|tation. There is encouragement to pray for par|don to that God who is gracious and merciful, with whom there is forgivene&s;s. There is encourage|ment to &s;eek the Lord while he may be found, to call upon him while he is near. To cry for know|ledge, and lift up our voice for under&s;tanding, to &s;eek for it as &s;ilver, and &s;earch for it as for hid trea|&s;ure: To wait, upon him for further light and in|fluence, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means by which he is ordinarily wont to convey his ble&s;&s;ings, and com|municate the benefits of redemption to the children of men. Every ju&s;t di&s;couragement is removed.
<PB N="155" REF="010643_0154_0F81BD2439280CB0">
Should the &s;inner object, the&s;e endeavours will not expiate my guilt, or ju&s;tify me in the &s;ight of a holy God: It may be replied, they are not required for any &s;uch end, but as the way and means of ob|taining the knowledge of, and faith in an atone|ment that taketh away the &s;in of the world. Should he object further, I am dead in &s;in, unable to do any duty in a holy manner; it may be an&s;wered, that God may and often does make the unholy endea|vours of the unregenerate to &s;ub&s;erve his gracious de&s;igns towards them. For the efficacy of the means does not depend at all upon the holine&s;s of a &s;inner's attending upon them, but upon the appoint|ment and ble&s;&s;ing of God. He ble&s;&s;es his own means, though there be no &s;piritual goodne&s;s in our performances to recommend us to his favour. He has not directed &s;inners to wait upon him in his or|dinances, that they might hereby make them&s;elves worthy of a favourable regard, but that they might hereby be brought and kept in the way of his ble&s;|&s;ing. Many have been regenerated and converted in the u&s;e of the appointed means of grace, but no &s;inner was ever regenerated and converted by at|tending to the&s;e means in a holy manner.&mdash;But I pa&s;s to con&s;ider a third eva&s;ion, which may be thus expre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ALLOWING that the commands which God has in his word given to &s;inners are precepts of the go&s;pel, &s;o carry encouragement as well as obligation to obedience, yet &s;ince all encouraging motives to obedience are derived from the go&s;pel, or revelation of mercy to the ungodly, through Chri&s;t, they can have no acce&s;s to the minds of tho&s;e who do not believe the go&s;pel, which is the ca&s;e of every unre|generate man. For whoever believes the go&s;pel,
<PB N="156" REF="010643_0155_0F81BD250834F3C0">
is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that faith which ju&s;tifies the guilty, purifies the heart, works by love, and is the princi|ple of evangelical obedience. When therefore &s;in|ners are commanded to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life, this implies and &s;up|po&s;es faith, as the principle of obedience. They are fir&s;t to believe unto ju&s;tification, and then obey all the commands of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, The que&s;tion we are now con&s;ider|ing, is not whether &s;inners ought to obey the pre|cepts of the go&s;pel from faith? That is readily owned: But the whole di&s;pute here, &s;o far as I un|der&s;tand it, may be reduced to two points.</P>
<P>WHETHER the commands to duty, which are directed to &s;inners in the go&s;pel, bind them to obey in &s;uch a manner as they are capable of before they believe to ju&s;tification. And,</P>
<P>WHETHER the word of God does or can con|vey any encouraging motive to &s;uch obedience, to the con&s;cience of one who does not believe to ju&s;ti|fication.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t enquiry has been an&s;wered already.&mdash;For it has been &s;hewn, that as the unregenerate are capable of ob&s;erving the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of tho&s;e duties we are now &s;peaking of, &s;o the divine command binds this upon them. And though &s;uch obedience be defective in principle and end, yet tis good in its proper place and kind, and has a happy tendency in divers re&s;pects.</P>
<P>THESE things have been particularly con&s;idered, and need not be repeated. There is certainly more good, and le&s;s evil, in attending the means of grace from natural principle, than neglecting them utter|ly. And this infers an obligation on the con&s;cience,
<PB N="157" REF="010643_0156_0F81BD25C6BD72D8">
to chu&s;e the good, and avoid the evil. But if any are not &s;atisfied, I would further a&s;k, Is it not a &s;in to reject and refu&s;e the means of grace?&mdash;If &s;o, does it not plainly follow, that it is a duty to attend to them? Is it not the duty of tho&s;e (for in&s;tance) to whom the outward call of the go&s;pel is &s;ent, to hear and attend to it, and not oppo&s;e the means of grace at a di&s;tance, &s;o put the word of God far a|way? Did not the deputy Sergius Paulus do as he ought to do, when he called the Apo&s;tles Barnabas and Saul, and de&s;ired to hear the word? And did not Elymas the Sorcerer &s;in in oppo&s;ing it? And was not the conduct of the Bereans commendable in attending chearfully and candidly to the preach|ing of Paul, and &s;earching the &s;criptures daily to &s;ee whether tho&s;e things were &s;o? Yet it was the con|&s;equence, and not the principle and cau&s;e of their doing &s;o, that many believed. Be&s;ides, are not &s;in|ners exhorted to duties, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FAITH? Was it not for this end that Chri&s;t directs the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures, which te&s;tified of him? And calls every one who has ears to hear? Is not the &s;aving knowledge and belief of the truth concerning Chri&s;t, the meat which endureth to e|verla&s;ting life, the food by which the ju&s;t live? And does not Chri&s;t exhort the Jews to labour for this? It is then the duty of men to attend to the&s;e precepts, before they have &s;aving faith. For I think it mu&s;t appear ab&s;urd to the common &s;en&s;e of man|kind, to &s;ay that when men are exhorted and com|manded to u&s;e means in order to a certain end, they mu&s;t fir&s;t obtain the end, before they are bound or warranted to u&s;e the means. I a&s;k further, Is not unbelief a &s;in? If &s;o, is it not the duty of tho&s;e to whom the go&s;pel is preached to believe in Chri&s;t? And does not this infer an obligation to the u&s;e of
<PB N="158" REF="010643_0157_0F81BD264D6BA370">
tho&s;e means by which faith comes antecedent to their obtaining it? Moreover, it will not be denyed that the word of &s;alvation is to be declared to un|believers (as well as others) as a means of faith and regeneration. The &s;criptures were written at fir&s;t, and have been by a particular providence pre&s;erved to this day, as a means of ingenerating, as well as confirming and increa&s;ing faith and holine&s;s. Faith cometh by hearing, &s;ays one Apo&s;tle: And the&s;e things are written that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, &s;ays another. Whether men are to u&s;e means in order to obtain faith, or not, I think it has never been di&s;puted by any profe&s;t chri&s;tians, that God may and does u&s;e outward means, as &s;ub|&s;ervient to his working faith in the elect. Now I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, whether the&s;e means by which God worketh faith, do not imply and &s;uppo&s;e an active attendance in us. Will the written word in&s;truct us if we will not read it, or hear it read, or be attentive, and take notice of the import and evi|dence of the truth there revealed? Or will the preached word have any &s;aving effect, if we will not hear it with attention? That the word may accom|pli&s;h the end for which it is &s;ent, it mu&s; be heard, that is, the &s;ound mu&s;t not only &s;trike our ears, but awake our attention, and put us upon con&s;idering the meaning, importance and proof of what is declared. And I am &s;ure that attention and con&s;ide|ration imply active exertment. If faith comes by hearing, or by report (as &s;ome incline to tran&s;late the word) I &s;hould conclude, that before I receive this report, it behoves me to con&s;ider, who is the reporter? Whether he is to be confided in? Whe|ther the te&s;timony be genuine or &s;purious? What does it import? And is it of any concernment to me? In this manner unbelievers are commanded to

hear, and it is by hearing in this manner that faith is obtained, whereby we call upon the Lord unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>BESIDES it mu&s;t be added, that before men believe to ju&s;tification, they may be, and ordina|rily at lea&s;t are &s;o far enlightned, by the divine word and &s;pirit, as to be convinced, in &s;ome man|ner, of the truth and authority of revelation.&mdash;There are &s;uch evidences of the chri&s;tian religion, obvious to attentive minds, as are &s;ufficient to convince tho&s;e who are not &s;piritually enlightned, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were divinely authorized: Since no man could do &s;uch mira|cles as they did, except God were with them.&mdash;And therefore a conviction of their obligation, to ob&s;erve the precepts of the go&s;pel to &s;inners, may have &s;uch acce&s;s to their con&s;ciences, as to bind them to obedience. Now &s;urely it is their duty, in this ca&s;e, to ob&s;erve the divine coun&s;els and precepts, from <HI>&s;uch</HI> faith, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> principles (tho' not in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e &s;upernatural and &s;piritual) rather than by pre&s;umptuous di&s;obedience to op|po&s;e the convictions of their own con&s;cience, and de&s;pitefully re&s;i&s;t the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>LET us now proceed to the other point pro|po&s;ed to con&s;ideration, viz. Whether any ju&s;t or well grounded encouragement to obey the divine precepts directed to the unregenerate in the &s;crip|tures, can have acce&s;s to the mind and con&s;cience, &s;o as to influence the conduct of one who does not &s;avingly believe in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>I ANSWER.&mdash;There may be a well grounded per&s;ua&s;ion that God deals with men in this world in a way of mercy, and not according to the rigor of ju&s;tice. The ordinary di&s;pen&s;ations of provi|dence
<PB N="160" REF="010643_0159_0F81BD27CC2A1AF0">
give &s;ome intimations that God is reconci|lable to &s;inners, though not clear and di&s;tinct, and full enough to &s;atisfy an awakened con&s;cience. God has not left him&s;elf without witne&s;s of his merciful de&s;igns, in that he has &s;o kindly pro|vided for us in this world, &s;upplying our wants, and filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s, as the Apo&s;tle has ob&s;erved. He has al&s;o furni&s;hed us with a great variety of remedies, under tho&s;e calamities and di&s;ea&s;es, to which &s;in has made us liable. The fallen angels are not dealt with in this manner. All this kindne&s;s and mercy which is exerci&s;ed towards men, gives &s;ome comfortable intimation. And therefore the Apo&s;tle urges this as an argument, to per&s;uade the Ly&s;trians to the chri&s;tian faith.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 14.17.</NOTE> The&s;e were an evidence that the &s;tate of fallen man was not ab&s;olutely de&s;perate. Upon the&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle, Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> has this reflection: <Q>To imagine that God had no other de&s;ign in his long-&s;uffering, but that of vengeance, had been a notion un&s;uitable to the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of God. He would not have pretended him&s;elf to be a friend, if he had harboured nothing but enmity in his heart again&s;t them.</Q> It is true death is the end of all men, and of all the&s;e mercies of providence: Yet this hinders not but that, they intimate the merciful di&s;po&s;itions of God towards &s;inful man: Otherwi&s;e how can we under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle's words, the goodne&s;s of God leadeth, that is en|courageth or allureth to repentance, if all the goodne&s;s of God to &s;inful man, in the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of providence, give no comfortable hint, not the lea&s;t relief again&s;t that terror and de&s;pair which a conviction of guilt tends to produce.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="010643_0160_0F81BD2898AB52A8">MOREOVER, a per&s;on who does not believe to ju&s;tification, may be per&s;uaded from the te&s;timony of &s;cripture, that God now commands every man to repent, and be converted, that their &s;ins may be blotted out; to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t that they may be &s;aved: And con&s;equently that &s;inners are on probation for eternal life, under a con&s;titution of grace. Many favours and privileges are granted to unbelievers, by virtue of that act of grace which has pa&s;&s;ed, through the mediation of the Son of God. A reprieve is granted to them, that they may be treated with, and called to repentance, up|on the foundation of a covenant of grace. It is true, while they are unbelievers and impenitent, the condemning &s;entence of the law &s;tands in force a|gain&s;t them; and will be executed upon all who are not when they die united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o inte|re&s;ted in the &s;aving benefits he has purcha&s;ed, ac|cording to the new and gracious covenant. Yet this is not incon&s;i&s;tent with their being upon pro|bation, under the gracious di&s;pen&s;ation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Mediator of the new covenant. While God's forbearance, and their day of gracious vi&s;ita|tion la&s;ts, the door of mercy is open to them:&mdash;They are not excluded from hope. The &s;entence of the law will not be executed upon them, unle&s;s they reject the grace of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>NOW this being the ca&s;e, here is great encourage|ment to the unregenerate to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, by a diligent attendance to pre&s;cribed means. For however they are not at pre&s;ent inte|re&s;ted in the &s;pecial benefits of the go&s;pel-covenant, there is gound to hope that they may obtain an in|tere&s;t therein. God does not require them to &s;eek for that good which he cannot honourably be&s;tow,
<PB N="162" REF="010643_0161_0F81BD299DEBBE88">
or they are incapable of enjoying. The means God has required us to u&s;e for this end are wi&s;ely a|dapted to it: And men are able to attend to the&s;e means by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as has been be|fore largely proved. There is, as has been &s;hewn, a work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to our be|lieving to ju&s;tification. And herein &s;o much know|ledge of the go&s;pel is conveyed to the mind, as not only convinces the &s;inner that it is his duty to attend to the pre&s;cribed means of grace, but al&s;o encoura|ges him in this way to wait upon God. And I doubt not but that in the work of conver&s;ion, the knowledge of the truth revealed in the go&s;pel, to|gether with the comfort and encouragement which it brings with it, does, many times at lea&s;t, if not commonly, enter the mind by &s;uch gradual advan|ces, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine with any cer|tainty, how far the&s;e illuminations and encourage|ments were preparatory to conver&s;ion, and at what point of time the principle of &s;piritual life was fir&s;t infu&s;ed; or when we were fir&s;t enabled to di&s;cern the things of the Spirit of God in a &s;piritual man|ner, and beholding his glory exhibited in the go&s;pel, were thereby changed into his image.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of what has been offered under this head of argument, is: The &s;criptures expre&s;ly re|quire and direct the unregenerate to attend to the outward means, whereby men are ordinarily bro't to the &s;aving knowledge of the truth. The&s;e com|mands are not founded upon a covenant of works, requiring perfcect obedience to the law of nature, in order to eternal life. Nor are they mere decla|rations of law or duty, without any encouragements to obedience; but are con&s;equent upon, and be|long to that gracious con&s;titution, which took place
<PB N="163" REF="010643_0162_0F81BD2AD42E4E38">
in the world upon the promi&s;e of a Saviour. The&s;e duties are enjoined, as means of accompli&s;hing God's gracious purpo&s;es, in the &s;alvation of &s;inners, ac|cording to that new and gracious covenant, accord|ing to which, to him that worketh not, but believ|eth in him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed for righteou&s;ne&s;s. The divine command then, con&s;idered in the relation it bears to the re|velation of mercy, and the end for which it is given, not only lays an obligation of obedience upon the con&s;cience, of every one who hears the call of the go&s;|pel, but al&s;o carries an encouraging motive to endea|vours of obedience, antecedent to that faith in Chri&s;t, with which ju&s;tification is connected by the divine promi&s;e. And there is therefore encouragement to the unregenerate to labour for the meat which en|dureth to everla&s;ting life, in &s;uch a manner as they can, though they are morally unable to do &s;o, in the manner they ought. Their endeavours in a way of attendance to pre&s;cribed duties, however de|fective and unholy, have, by the appointment of God, a good tendency, and are well adapted to &s;ub&s;erve tho&s;e ends and purpo&s;es, for which they are de&s;igned and required by God. Indeed were it nece&s;&s;ary, that they who obtain eternal life &s;hould all work their way to it by perfect per&s;onal obedi|ence to the law, or were any holy qualifications re|qui&s;ite, to render us worthy objects of divine mer|cy, no endeavours of the unregenerate would avail to any &s;uch purpo&s;es. But God's mercy is rich and free. It waits not for amiable qualifications in &s;inners to draw it forth. God often ble&s;&s;es his own ordinances for &s;aving good, to tho&s;e who do not at|tend upon them in a worthy manner. Sinners are ordinarily regenerated in the u&s;e of appointed

<HEAD>SERMON VI. Objections con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>MY propo&s;ed method now leads me to con&s;ider &s;ome of the principal objections to the doct|rine which has thus far been contended for. Though a well e&s;tabli&s;hed truth is not to be parted with, becau&s;e it may &s;eem to be pre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome difficulties not ea&s;ily removed (for there may be very puzling que&s;tions &s;tarted about the mo&s;t in|di&s;putable truths both in nature and religion) yet it is a good &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of true religion, to <HI>take up the &s;tumbling block out of the way.</HI> And this is what will now be attempted. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT has been objected, that the duty which God requires of man, is either the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, or go&s;pel holine&s;s: But the pretended du|ties to which unbelievers are exhorted, are neither of the&s;e. They are not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law: For that requires perfect obedience, and denounces death again&s;t the &s;oul that &s;ins. They are not go&s;|pel holine&s;s: For that always flows from faith.&mdash;The&s;e duties are then of an ambiguous kind, which have no encouragement or warrant in &s;cripture.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="010643_0165_0F81BD2F6108AE28">HOWEVER plau&s;ible this may appear, if it is clo&s;ely examined, it will be found of no weight.&mdash;And that we may judge of the pertinency of this plea, we mu&s;t endeavour to fix the meaning of the terms in which it is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF <HI>by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law</HI> is meant <HI>a righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to be wrought by man as the matter of his ju&s;tification, and ground of his title to eternal life;</HI> then it is denyed that this is any duty required of man. God has not commanded or encouraged any one to &s;eek ju&s;tification and eternal life by his own works, as the meritorious ground or condition there|of. Chri&s;t indeed exhorts his di&s;ciples to <HI>be perfect:</HI> So does Paul exhort the Corinthians to <HI>perfect ho|line&s;s in the fear of God.</HI> Yet neither of them ex|hort to &s;elf-ju&s;tifying duties. Chri&s;t &s;ays al&s;o to the young ruler, <HI>if thou wilt enter into life, keep he commandments:</HI> And to the lawyer, <HI>love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy &s;elf, and thou &s;halt live.</HI> But whatever was his de&s;ign herein, it was not to enjoin or countenance an impo&s;&s;ible, I may &s;ay, a criminal attempt, to merit eternal life by their own works. The Apo&s;tles teach us, that keeping the commands of God from faith in Chri&s;t, is the way to enter into the kingdom of God. But they never teach us to &s;eek ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God by our own righteou&s;ne&s;s. I allow then, yea I contend, that neither unbelievers nor believers are warranted by the holy &s;criptures to attempt any thing in a way of duty for the purpo&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>IF <HI>by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law is</HI> meant <HI>obedi|ence to the commands of God, from a regard to the authority of God;</HI> then I imagine that it is the duty of all, to whom the&s;e commands are made known,
<PB N="167" REF="010643_0166_0F81BD3010782408">
to obey them, whether they are believers or unbe|lievers. And they are warranted and encouraged by the word of God to endeavour to obey them.&mdash;Go&s;pel holine&s;s is defined by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>keeping the commands of God,</HI> And when men unregene|rate attend to tho&s;e in&s;trumental duties which are enjoined upon them, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that God has commanded them to do &s;o; then they &s;o far obey the divine command, they do as they ought to do, and as they are encouraged to do, as has been proved at large.</P>
<P>FINALLY, <HI>if we under&s;tand by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law a perfect compliance with the perceptive will of God;</HI> then it mu&s;t be &s;aid that this is the duty of all, and that all are warranted and encouraged to aim at perfection, though it is certain that none will ever attain to it in this world.</P>
<P>TO plead then in oppo&s;ition to the arguments which have been offered in the preceeding di&s;cour|&s;es, that no endeavours of obedience, which fall &s;hort of legal perfection, are required or warranted in &s;cripture to be performed by men, antecedently to their believing to ju&s;tification, is plainly begging the que&s;tion. The contrary has been proved, viz. that &s;uch endeavours of obedience as men are capa|ble of before they are born again, though far &s;hort of perfection, are by the divine command enjoined upon &s;inners: And that there are encouraging in|ducements to &s;uch endeavours in the word of God: And that the&s;e encouragements may be &s;o far ap|prehended and believed by one who has not &s;aving faith, that he &s;hall be influenced thereby in his con|duct. There is &s;omething required of men in a way of duty, which they are warranted and encou|raged to attend unto, previous to regeneration, and
<PB N="168" REF="010643_0167_0F81BD30CD548190">
which they have a power by the common influence of the Holy Spirit &s;o to perform, as that tho&s;e gra|cious ends, for the &s;ake of which it is required, may by this means be an&s;wered. And if any incline to expre&s;s their contempt of this a&s;&s;ertion, by calling &s;uch endeavours <HI>dubious or ambiguous, neither legal nor evangelical righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> it need not move us. We are &s;ufficiently kept in countenance by the &s;crip|ture commands and exhortations to the unregene|rate, and by the commendation which the in&s;pired hi&s;torian has given to the conduct of the <HI>prudent Deputy,</HI> and <HI>noble B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">reans,</HI> which had a &s;ub&s;erviency to their obtaining faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is further objected, that to direct men to duties, as the way to obtain faith and regeneration, is to a&s;&s;ert the expediency and nece&s;&s;ity of a preli|minary righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, to qualify us for the divine mercy: Which will, in its nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence, &s;hut out tho&s;e who are utterly unworthy, from all comfort or benefit in and by the revelation of divine mercy by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, de&s;igned for the relief and encouragement of the vile&s;t and guiltie&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, If it were pretended that mens at|tendance to the means of grace qualified them mo|rally for the divine mercy, or rendred them worthy of a favourable regard, &s;o that it was expedient or nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;inner &s;hould be con&s;cious of &s;ome change in him&s;elf for the better, as a recommenda|tion to the mercy of God, before he has any en|couragement or warrant to hope in the mercy of God, and come to Chri&s;t for life, then I own there would be ground for this exception. But this pre|tence has been often rejected. Our a&s;&s;erting the obligation and advantage of attending the means of
<PB N="169" REF="010643_0168_0F81BD3189C5FFB8">
grace, does not in the lea&s;t clog the divine procla|mation of mercy in the go&s;pel, or forbid the guiltie&s;t of mankind to take that comfort and encourage|ment which the &s;aving truth is de&s;igned to convey to them, whenever it finds acce&s;s to their con&s;ci|ence. Still it mu&s;t and may be maintained, that <HI>who&s;oever will may come and take of the waters of life freely.</HI> But no one will have an ear for this revelation of mercy, &s;o long as he is &s;tupidly in&s;en|&s;ible of the mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of &s;in and guilt, eager|ly engaged in a cour&s;e of wilful rebellion again&s;t the light of his own con&s;cience, and in pur&s;uit of the vanities of this pre&s;ent world. The &s;aving truth will not be received into the mind and heart of tho&s;e, who never attend to tho&s;e means, whereby the knowledge of it is conveyed. And therefore God has commanded &s;inners to u&s;e the&s;e outward means; and by the influence of his Spirit the&s;e commands are in&s;trumental to bring and keep them in the way of his ble&s;&s;ing. It is indeed the duty of the unregenerate, <HI>to labour for the meat which en|dureth to everla&s;ting life,</HI> for they are commanded &s;o to do. Yet it does not follow from hence, that God accompanies their endeavours with a ble&s;&s;ing, from a regard to their performances, con&s;idered as their duties, or as inferring a worthine&s;s of his fa|vour; but becau&s;e they are means of his appoint|ment. To a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of human endeavours in this view, in order to conver&s;ion, is not &s;urely to hold the nece&s;&s;ity or expediency of a preliminary human righteou&s;ne&s;s, to render us worthy of, or give us a right to the divine mercy thro' Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if the guiltie&s;t and vile&s;t part of man|kind are &s;hut out from hope or comfort by our a&s;&s;erting the obligation and encouragement of mens
<PB N="170" REF="010643_0169_0F81BD325699B0B8">
u&s;ing the means of conver&s;ion, in order to their ob|taining converting grace. Methinks that doctrine is equally obnoxious to this objection, which teaches that the &s;elf-righteous devotee is twofold more the child of hell, and in greater danger of damnation than the profane. If the go&s;pel doctrine mu&s;t be &s;et in &s;uch a light as to carry a comfortable a&s;pect towards the &s;ecure and hardned &s;inner, why not al&s;o towards the &s;elf-righteous? But I forbear. The plain truth is, without &s;ubverting the go&s;pel procla|mation, or holding the nece&s;&s;ity of a preliminary human righteou&s;ne&s;s to recommend us to the divine mercy, we may maintain that the &s;elf-righteous mu&s;t be humbled, and the carele&s;s awakened, and both as peri&s;hing &s;inners, equally de&s;titute of a claim up|on God's ju&s;tice, wait upon him in the u&s;e of ap|pointed means, for that free mercy, which is ex|tended <HI>to all, and upon all that believe without diffe|rence;</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t will profit them nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT is objected, that the be&s;t actions of the un|regenerate, are &s;inful; &s;o are an abomination in the &s;ight of God: He neither approves nor will accept them. Is it not then ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that God &s;hould command and encourage &s;uch actions as he hates, and will not accept?&mdash;I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THOUGH the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate are &s;infully defective, yet there is in them &s;omething good and right in its proper place and kind. This has been explained and proved under a former head; which I &s;hall not repeat.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOUGH God does not command and en|courage &s;in, yet he may and does command and encourage men to &s;uch actions, which he knows that if they are done at all will be done in a &s;inful
<PB N="171" REF="010643_0170_0F81BD3313E44900">
manner. The be&s;t actions of believers have &s;in ad|hering to them: Yet I think it will not be denyed, that they are bound and encouraged to &s;uch duties. If God's commands are in them&s;elves good, and he has good de&s;igns in giving them, there is nothing unworthy of the divine perfections in &s;uppo&s;ing that our obedience to them is required and encouraged, however defective it may be. This does not imply his countenancing evil. So far as our actions are conformable to his commands, they are good, tho' much evil may be mixed with them. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. THESE actions which are materially good, and done according to the dictates of con&s;cience, are in &s;ome re&s;pects approved by God. Thus he did ap|prove of what Jehu did in cutting off the family of Ahab, and de&s;troying Baal out of I&s;rael. And he accepted the repentance and reformation of the Ninevites &s;o far, that <HI>he repented of the evil</HI> with which he had threatned them, tho' it is not thought that their repentance was to eternal life. No acti|ons of the unregenerate are accepted as go&s;pel holi|ne&s;s, or <HI>as &s;acrifices of a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour,</HI> re|wardable with eternal ble&s;&s;ings. But God u&s;ually connects a ble&s;&s;ing with their endeavours in a way of obedience to his commands, yea &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as are &s;ub&s;ervient to their eternal well-being. What|ever becomes of our rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions con|cerning what is agreable or di&s;agreable to the divine perfections, facts will and mu&s;t &s;tand. The plow|ing of the wicked however &s;inful, is commonly fol|lowed with the ble&s;&s;ing of God's providence. And the reading, hearing, praying, &amp;c. of the unrege|nerate, however unholy, is u&s;ually followed with further knowledge, outward privileges, and inward influences of the Holy Spirit. We may be &s;ure
<PB N="172" REF="010643_0171_0F81BD34408335D8">
that there is &s;ame mi&s;take in &s;uch rea&s;onings, as lead us to conclude, that it is repugnant to God's per|fections to do that, which is evidently and undeni|ably done by him.</P>
<P>I WOULD not however intimate, that God con|nects his ble&s;&s;ings with the actions of men unrege|nerate, out of regard to any goodne&s;s or worthine&s;s in what they do, or as a reward of their obedience. This mu&s;t be re&s;olved into his &s;overeign plea&s;ure. When the man who was born blind, in obedience to the command of Chri&s;t, went and wa&s;hed in the pool of Siloam, he did &s;urely as he ought to do: And his conduct was approved. Yet his cure was not the reward of his obedience, though he had ju&s;tly remained blind, had he refu&s;ed to u&s;e the means pre&s;cribed. It was &s;overeign unmerited goodne&s;s that ordained both the end and means. So it is free grace that connects a ble&s;&s;ing with our attending the means of conver&s;ion, and not the worthine&s;s of our performances. We do well to u&s;e the means of God's appointment: Yet the di|vine ble&s;&s;ing is not the reward of our well doing, but flows from the meer favour and mercy of God. The ca&s;e is plain enough, if we would not puzzle our&s;elves with fooli&s;h &s;ubtilties. If our u&s;ing the means of faith and conver&s;ion were as certainly and con&s;tantly connected with our under&s;tanding and believing the &s;aving truth, as faith is with ju&s;tifica|tion and &s;alvation, yea if &s;uch a connection was as plainly declared by a divine promi&s;e, there would be no more ground to infer, that God gives us faith as the reward of our u&s;ing the means, than that we are ju&s;tified by the merit or as the reward of our believing. The divine ble&s;&s;ing however conveyed to us, whether mediately or immediately, flows from
<PB N="173" REF="010643_0172_0F81BD3487B89000">
God's free grace, and not from a regard to any thing either done by us, or wrought in us. The idea of merit may as well be &s;eperated from our actions, as from our pa&s;&s;ive perception.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is further objected, that if God prompts and a&s;&s;i&s;ts and ble&s;&s;es our endeavours, then our friendly corre&s;pondence with God is begun. But before men are united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o ju&s;tified by faith, there is no friendly corre&s;pondence, between them and God:&mdash;They are the objects of his wrath and cur&s;e. All the exerci&s;es of &s;aving mercy to &s;inners are thro' Chri&s;t, in con&s;ideration of his me|rits, and con&s;equently pre&s;uppo&s;e our union to and intere&s;t in him.</P>
<P>THE weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity of this objection, will appear from the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF all exerci&s;es of &s;aving mercy towards &s;in|ners pre&s;uppo&s;e their union to and intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, then mankind were intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t before a Mediator was provided. For I think it will not be denyed that the appointment of Chri&s;t to the office and work of Mediator, was an exerci&s;e of &s;aving mercy towards men. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. THEN &s;inners are united to Chri&s;t before they believe on him. For certainly it is an exerci&s;e of divine mercy to &s;end the call of the go&s;pel to men, and make them attentive to it, and thereby work faith in them. Yet I think it is granted on all hands, that it is by faith that we become united to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEN we are united to Chri&s;t before we are united to Chri&s;t. For when &s;oever, and however we are united to him, it cannot be refu&s;ed, that our fir&s;t ingrafting into him, is an exerci&s;e of &s;aving mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="010643_0173_0F81BD359A9AC698">THE truth is, the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel cove|nant, viz. of pardon, &s;anctification, and &s;alvation, are made only to tho&s;e who are in Chri&s;t by a &s;pecial and &s;aving union: Which union takes place in and upon our believing. Till then we are under con|demnation, and children of wrath. Yet God does in various ways exerci&s;e his mercy towards &s;inners, before they are ju&s;tified by faith in Chri&s;t. He gives them the good things of this life. He &s;ends the go&s;pel to them. He grants them &s;piritual pri|vileges. He &s;trives with them by his Spirit, to ex|cite and a&s;&s;i&s;t their attendance to the means of grace. And &s;ome he regenerates, and works faith in, &s;o they are united to Chri&s;t federally and vitally, and inherit the promi&s;es of ju&s;tification, and &s;anctifying grace. In a word, God takes various methods, as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight, with &s;inners, to draw them to Chri&s;t, that they may be &s;aved. If this be what is meant by a friendly corre&s;pondence between God and man, it is certain that this is begun before men are &s;avingly united to Chri&s;t, and ju&s;tified by faith in him. I deny not that the&s;e things are the fruits of Chri&s;t's mediation; or that &s;o far as men are partakers of the&s;e favours, they are intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t. But I maintain that the&s;e things do not pre&s;uppo&s;e a &s;aving union to, and intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. So the objection mu&s;t unavoidably fall, as being pointed again&s;t undeniable fact.</P>
<P>OBJ. 5. BUT till &s;inners are born again and believe in Chri&s;t, they are in a &s;tate of condemnation. Is it not then a glaring ab&s;urdity, to &s;ay that the &s;crip|ture which expre&s;ly excludes all &s;uch from the kingdom of God, &s;hould contain encouragements to them to hope for &s;alvation? A &s;entence of con|demnation cuts off all encouragements, as well as promi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="010643_0174_0F81BD36138BD860">I ANSWER.&mdash;It is granted that there is neither promi&s;e nor encouragement to an unregenerate unbelieving &s;inner, that he may be &s;aved, while he continues unregenerate and unbelieving. But it does not follow, becau&s;e a man is in a &s;tate of condemnation, that there is no rea&s;on to hope that he may believe unto ju&s;tification, and &s;o pa&s;s out of a &s;tate of condemnation into a &s;tate of &s;alvati|on. For then the condition of every unbeliever would be ab&s;olutely de&s;perate. The clo&s;e&s;t con|nection that ever any one &s;uppo&s;ed there was, bet|ween a &s;inner's attending the means of conver|&s;ion and obtaining converting grace, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel declaration, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, and he that believeth not is condemned already." The&s;e words only im|port, that faith is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, or that there are no promi&s;es of &s;alvation to unbelievers; which I think was never denyed by any profe&s;t chri&s;tian; and concludes nothing again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance (even by a divine promi&s;e) of converting grace to the unregenerate, upon their &s;eeking for it in the u&s;e of appointed means, which is however more than is here pleaded for. A promi&s;e of converting grace is not a promi&s;e of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, nor is it incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of condemnation: E&s;pecially if (as we have been told) there are no promi&s;es of &s;al|vation to the grace of regeneration, (though in|&s;eperably therewith connected) but to the exer|ci&s;es of the new nature in faith and repentance.&mdash;God promi&s;ed his people, when under correction for their &s;ins, that he would give them a new heart: Yet I think no one will pretend that they were pardoned, or delivered from a &s;tate of con|demnation, till they repented.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="010643_0175_0F81BD36C6E98BE8">OBJ. 6. Unbelievers do with their whole heart reject &s;alvation by Chri&s;t; all their endeavours are acts of oppo&s;ition to the way of life by him. Is it not then mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch endeavours &s;hould conduce to their obtaining faith, or a new heart?</P>
<P>ANSWER I. This is not true without re&s;tricti|on. In &s;ome &s;en&s;e per&s;ons unregenerate may &s;eek regenerating grace and &s;alvation, as has been explained and proved at large formally. And they may al&s;o in &s;ome re&s;pects chu&s;e the way, or u&s;e the means in which the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are ob|tained. This they do when they attend to tho&s;e in&s;trumental duties of reading, hearing, con&s;ide|ration, prayer, which are the way and means, in and by which God is plea&s;ed to enlighten, hum|ble, and convert &s;inners, and &s;o bring them into a &s;tate of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>ANSW. 2. Such endeavours as imply a reject|ion of &s;alvation, and the way of &s;alvation, in &s;ome re&s;pects, may be a means of obtaining that divine light and influence, which &s;hall effectually over|come all our oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel, and cau&s;e us to embrace it with all our hearts, <HI>as a faithful &s;aying and worthy of all acceptation.</HI> This is not hard to conceive of. Many by examining the evidences of the truth in order to oppo&s;e and con|fute them, have by this means been happily con|vinced. Yea it is no ab&s;urdity in the nature of things, to &s;uppo&s;e that there may be the mo&s;t certain and con&s;tant connection between the&s;e things. Though men may have no &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of the glory of the go&s;pel, or &s;piritual de&s;ire to experience its transforming power, yet their attending the means of grace and in&s;truction,
<PB N="177" REF="010643_0176_0F81BD3A6806AC70">
may have a connection with, and conducivene&s;s to this happy effect.</P>
<P>OBJ. 7. IF God has encouraged all tho&s;e to hope in his mercy who heartily de&s;ire it, and a&s;k for it, the encouragement is as great as can be. Mercy is offered on the lowe&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ANS. If a man mu&s;t be con&s;cious of <HI>&s;aving de&s;ires,</HI> or in other words that his de&s;ires of mercy are <HI>&s;incere, holy and &s;piritual,</HI> before he can warrantably take any encouragement, or hope for any benefit in at|tending to the means of grace, then we mu&s;t &s;ay, woe to that man who&s;e confidence in the heartine&s;s and &s;incerity of his de&s;ires fails him.&mdash;If a <HI>&s;aving de&s;ire</HI> of mercy is nece&s;&s;ary as a condition or qua|lification, for a man's obtaining any &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings from God, they &s;urely are in a &s;ad ca&s;e, who want this requi&s;ite, and are unable to produce or create it in them&s;elves. Deplorable is the &s;tate of the un|converted, if they mu&s;t fir&s;t have &s;incere, that is, holy &s;piritual de&s;ires of converting grace, before there is any ground to hope for their conver&s;ion, or any warrant or encouragement for their attend|ing the means, in order to the effecting this ble&s;&s;ed change.</P>
<P>THERE is encouragement to the endeavours of the unregenerate on waiting upon God for his &s;av|ing mercy, yea &s;uch encouragement as may reach, their minds, and influence their conduct, antecedent to their believing to ju&s;tification, as has been for|merly &s;hewn. What the connection is between attending the means of conver&s;ion, and obtaining converting grace, depends merely upon the will of God: Its nature and degree are as God has &s;een, fit to ordain. And all rea&s;onings concerning this
<PB N="178" REF="010643_0177_0F81BD3B623CB5A0">
matter from the character or &s;tate of the unrege|nerate, or the quality of their actions, are nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT may be objected, that all the encourage|ments as well as promi&s;es of God to &s;inners are in Chri&s;t. But they who with their whole heart re|ject Chri&s;t, as all unregenerate men do, are not in Chri&s;t. And it will overthrow the go&s;pel to &s;ay that there are any encouragements for &s;uch.</P>
<P>THIS has been in effect an&s;wered already. If it concludes any thing in oppo&s;ition to the doctrine we are pleading for, it concludes again&s;t the po&s;&s;i|bility of a &s;inner's conver&s;ion or &s;alvation. For I reckon it is a &s;ettled point, that a &s;inner is not &s;av|ingly in Chri&s;t previous to faith and conver&s;ion. And when any one will tell me, how it is con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, for God to be&s;tow faith or conver|ting grace upon one who is not in Chri&s;t, I will tell him, how it is con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, for God to connect the be&s;towment of this favour with the u&s;e of means, yea and declare this connection too, for the encouragement of &s;inners in waiting upon him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the author &s;hould be thought to need an apology, for taking notice of &s;uch trifling ab&s;urd objections, as &s;everal of tho&s;e above mentioned &s;eem to be; he has this to &s;ay, that when &s;uch kind of arguments are gravely offered to the public, though men of better abilities may find better employments, yet it may not be ami&s;s for writers of a lower cla&s;s, to &s;hew, if they can, that &s;omething may be &s;aid in an&s;wer to them.</NOTE></P>
<P N="9">9. IT may be objected that the unregenerate are <HI>dead in &s;in.</HI> They have no de&s;ires of &s;piritual life. And to &s;ay that they may concur, or work with God

in introducing a vital principle, or preparing them|&s;elves for it, is as ab&s;urd as it would be to &s;ay, that dead Lazarus did &s;omething towards his re&s;ur|rection.</P>
<P>ANSWER. The nature and con&s;equences of &s;piri|tual death have in a former di&s;cour&s;e been enquired into. [To which the reader is referred for a parti|cular an&s;wer to this objection.] And therefore 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay at pre&s;ent, that though an unrege|nerate man is morally unable to do any acts of re|ligious obedience in a holy manner, yet he is able to attend the common means of conver&s;ion in &s;uch a manner, that by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, they may be effectual for tho&s;e good ends, for the &s;ake of which they are appointed and pre&s;cribed.&mdash;</P>
<P>OBJ. 10. To &s;uppo&s;e that the unregenerate are commanded and encouraged to &s;eek &s;alvation in at|tendance to religious duties, and that the grace of regeneration is ordinarily obtained in this way, &s;eems not con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel doctrine of &s;overeign free grace. For then, we mu&s;t conclude, that the divine favour is turned toward the &s;inner, becau&s;e of &s;ome comparative worthine&s;s beheld in him; and &s;o he has whereof to glory.</P>
<P>ANSWER. It is granted that God is &s;overeign in the exerci&s;es of his mercy. His grace is freely be|&s;towed. He owes his favour to none, but has a right to do what he will with his own. But with|out the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tence with the &s;cripture doctrine of &s;overeign free grace, it may be maintained, that men are required to &s;eek &s;alvation in attendance to appointed means, and that there is &s;uch a connection between &s;eeking and obtaining, that they who u&s;e
<PB N="180" REF="010643_0179_0F81BD3CCEA8E630">
the means &s;hould ordinarily attain to the end to which they are &s;ubordained. Yea if God be &s;overeign in the exerci&s;es of his mercy, he may then certainly glorify his grace in &s;uch a way, if he plea&s;e, as well as in another. That doctrine rather detracts from the divine &s;overeignty, which pretends from cer|tain rea&s;onings about antecedent fitne&s;s, to determine, that it is un&s;uitable for the great God, to extend his unmerited mercy to &s;inful creatures, in &s;uch a way as has here been pleaded for. This I think may properly be called limiting the Holy One. Not that we are to &s;uppo&s;e that the exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom and holine&s;s has no place in God's &s;overeign ap|pointments. But we mu&s;t not object our precon|ceived notions of what is wi&s;e and fit, again&s;t the ways and di&s;pen&s;ations of God.</P>
<P>DIVINE &s;overeignty is manife&s;ted in appointing the way and manner in which, as well as the objects upon whom, the riches of free grace are to be di&s;|played. God's favours are not the le&s;s free, becau&s;e di&s;pen&s;ed in a certain e&s;tabli&s;hed order or method, and in the way of means, rather than in any other manner. It is &s;overeign goodne&s;s that confers on men common, as well as &s;piritual and &s;aving ble&s;|&s;ings: Yet we &s;ee, that in the common di&s;pen&s;ati|ons of providence, there is a connection between means and ends. It is &s;overeign goodne&s;s that gives us the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, with every other temporal mercy: Yet human endeavours are u&s;ually requi&s;ite, as means of acquiring the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t then &s;ay, that &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings are the free gifts of God, notwith&s;tanding they are be&s;towed by God and received by us in a &s;imilar way; or
<PB N="181" REF="010643_0180_0F81BD3E092297B0">
el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ay, that the good things of providence are not free gifts. There is as much rea&s;on for our neglecting all care about providing for a comforta|ble and hone&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in this world, le&s;t we &s;hould intrench upon the &s;overeign freene&s;s of God's mer|cies, as to neglect the care of our &s;ouls, upon any &s;uch plea, or pretence.&mdash; The common &s;en&s;e of mankind would condemn his folly, who &s;hould re|fu&s;e to labour for the meat that peri&s;heth, or even eat or drink, or take any care of him&s;elf, le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;own the free goodne&s;s of God in all his enjoyments. Why is it not then as ab&s;urd, to re|fu&s;e to labour for the meat which endureth to ever|la&s;ting life, in the u&s;e of God's appointed means, le&s;t it &s;hould imply a denial of the &s;overeign freene&s;s of divine grace?</P>
<P>WHATEVER connection there may be between our attending the means of grace, and receiving ef|fectual influences from the divine Spirit, the &s;ove|reignty of God in the exerci&s;es of mercy may be maintained to be fully con&s;i&s;tent therewith: And the glory of our &s;alvation from fir&s;t to la&s;t will be due to free grace. It was of God's free grace, that any of the children of men were cho&s;en in Chri&s;t to &s;alvation, before the foundation of the world. It was of grace that the mediator was provided, and his obedience and &s;ufferings accepted as the price of our redemption, and the way of reconciliation thro' him propo&s;ed to us. It was by preventing grace that we have been prompted to attend to the out|ward means, whereby the benefits of redemption are applied to the ve&s;&s;els of mercy. And it is by the &s;pecial grace and influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, that they become effectual to conver&s;ion and &s;al|vation.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="010643_0181_0F81BD3E7A63C100">OBJ. II. To direct men to &s;eek &s;alvatlon by at|tending the means of grace, (as they are called) will encourage them to depend upon their own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and vainly attempt to recommend them|&s;elves to God by their duties: which will lead them away from Chri&s;t, and the grace of God revealed in the go&s;pel, to tru&s;t in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ANSWER. Though it be true that &s;elf dependence is very natural to fallen man, and though &s;inners are perhaps always influenced in &s;ome degree by a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit, in their acts of religious obedience, yet it is not true, that a diligent attendance to the means of grace has a tendency to confirm and en|courage an undue dependance upon their own righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength. It has indeed a tendency to the very rever&s;e, to lead them to a right view of them&s;elves, which is the only effectual cure of a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit. Many people &s;eem to think, that &s;inners which take mo&s;t pains in religious duties, and &s;trive more earne&s;tly to enter into the kingdom of God, are the mo&s;t &s;elf-righteous, &amp; di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t in their own performances. But this is a mi&s;take. They who are mo&s;t &s;erious and engaged in &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate are u&s;ually more &s;en&s;i|ble of their manifold defects, than &s;uch as live in a &s;tupid neglect of religious duties, or a carele&s;s at|tendance to them. They who are awakened, and earne&s;tly engaged in the concerns of their eternal &s;tate, are more likely to be convinced of the breadth and &s;pirituality of the divine law, the &s;infulne&s;s of their own hearts and lives, and that they have no righteou&s;ne&s;s by which they can be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of the holy God. I grant that an awakened &s;inner may be very much influenced by a &s;elf-righ|teous &s;pirit, in his religious endeavours; but he is
<PB N="183" REF="010643_0182_0F81BD3F14B9B1D0">
not u&s;ually &s;o much under it, as they are, who are carele&s;s, and take little pains about the things of their eternal peace. And if he per&s;everes with &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and earne&s;tne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing into, or towards the kingdom of God, there is a probability that he will at length be &s;en&s;ibly convinced of the in&s;uffici|ency of his fal&s;e confidences, in which he u&s;ed to &s;eek &s;helter when pre&s;&s;ed with conviction of &s;in, as to abandon them all, and fly for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et before us in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>FOR it is to be remembered, that the ordinances of Chri&s;t on which &s;inners are called to attend, are de|&s;igned and adapted, to convey that light and in|&s;truction to their mind, whereby their mi&s;takes may be di&s;covered and corrected. The reading and preaching of the word are means of divine appoint|ment, to turn men from darkne&s;s to light. The go&s;pel revelation is &s;trongly pointed again&s;t the error of tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;h and tru&s;t in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, rejecting the righteou&s;ne&s;s and grace of God. Now an attentive reading, hearing and meditating on the great doctrines of the go&s;pel, has a tendency, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to lead them into ju&s;t views of things, and detect tho&s;e errors which lay the bottom of their &s;elf-righteous con|fidence.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, we ought to con&s;ider well what we mean, when we &s;peak of regarding or renounc|ing our own doing. For it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that our endeavours in attendance to duties are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, and in their proper place, u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, and ought &s;o to be con&s;idered by us. In other re&s;pects our performances are of no account at all. We mu&s;t not think that any thing which a
<PB N="184" REF="010643_0183_0F81BD3FD023B6C0">
&s;inner can do will avail in the lea&s;t degree to atone for his &s;in, or merit &s;alvation, or move God's pity, &amp;c. But we mu&s;t not &s;ay that human endeavours are u&s;ele&s;s in every re&s;pect. They have a &s;ub&s;erviency to the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of mankind, and are therefore required and encouraged by God. And we may warrantably hope for the divine ble&s;&s;ing, when we are excited and enabled to u&s;e the means by which it is u&s;ually obtained. I frankly own, that I cannot under&s;tand the con&s;i&s;tency of exhorting men to duties, and yet at the &s;ame time requiring them to di&s;regard and overlook them, as wholly u&s;e|le&s;s in every re&s;pect, ab&s;olutely good for nothing. And however people may e&s;&s;ay to do &s;o, they will always find it an impo&s;&s;ible attempt. They may be regarded in their proper place, of &s;ub&s;erviency to our eternal intere&s;t, without a &s;elf-righteous depen|dance on them. If any one is at a lo&s;s how to con|ceive of this, let him con&s;ider, that the faith, repen|tance, and good works of true chri&s;tians, are in their place u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, and may properly be attended to; and regarded by them in this view. Yet a &s;elf-righteous attention and regard to our own character is always &s;inful, and contrary to the go&s;pel: Which &s;hows, that there may be a re&s;pect to our own works, which is not &s;elf-righteous. Hence we find Paul <HI>rejoicing in the te&s;timony of his con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, he had his conver&s;ation in the world;</HI> and exhorting profe&s;&s;ed believers <HI>to prove their own work, that they might have rejoicing in them&s;elves, and not in another.</HI> It is not a &s;elf-righteous dependance upon their own works, for men to hope for a ble&s;&s;ing in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which God has pre&s;cribed and encou|raged them to, if their hope does not &s;pring from

the &s;uppo&s;ed worthine&s;s or merit of their own per|formances, but from the will and gracious appoint|ment of him, who worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the words of the Prophet I&s;aiah may be objected, <HI>I am found of them that &s;ought me not.</HI></P>
<P>ANSWER I. The Prophet in the&s;e words fore|tells the conver&s;ion of the Gentiles, this is the mo&s;t obvious meaning they exhibit; and they are accord|ingly under&s;tood and applied by the Apo&s;tle. <HI>I am &s;ought of them,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>that a&s;ked not for me,</HI> that is by the heathen who once a&s;ked not for me, nor knew me. <HI>I am found of them, that formerly &s;ought me not,</HI> but paid all their wor&s;hip to idols and fal&s;e gods. But the&s;e words do not imply that God ma|nife&s;ts him&s;elf &s;avingly to men, before they &s;eek him, by an attendance to tho&s;e means whereby he makes him&s;elf known: No more than the fir&s;t clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, <HI>I am &s;ought of them that a&s;ked not for me,</HI> imply that God is &s;ought before he is a&s;ked for.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is granted that God vi&s;its men with the call of the go&s;pel, and influence of his Spirit, previ|ous to their &s;eeking him. That is, divine grace pre|vents or is before hand of human endeavours. But this is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine I have here been defending. For there is a work of the divine word and Spirit preparatory to regeneration &amp; con|ver&s;ion; whereby &s;inners are influenced &amp; enabled to wait upon God in the u&s;e of means, and hear his voice &s;peaking peace to their con&s;ciences in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="186" REF="010643_0185_0F81BD4148681980">3. THOUGH it be granted, that God may and does &s;ometimes work faith in the hearts of men with|out any u&s;e of the common means of grace, as in the in&s;tance of Paul's conver&s;ion, yet this is plainly extraordinary; and is to be reckoned among his miraculous operations, as much as revealing his will by an audible voice from heaven. The &s;ame Saul, who was &s;urprized on the road to Dama&s;cus, de|clares expre&s;ly, that this is not the ordinary way in which God calls &s;inners to the faith and grace of the go&s;pel. Nothing can be concluded again&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of attending God's common pre&s;cribed means, from &s;uch extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>THESE appear to me to be the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble objections that we are at pre&s;ent concerned with. Whether they are of &s;ufficient weight to invalidate the foregoing arguments, let every one judge for him&s;elf in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity. And &s;o I have in &s;ome manner con&s;idered and &s;poken to the &s;everal particulars propo&s;ed, for the illu&s;tration and proof of the doctrine. The next di&s;cour&s;e will fini&s;h our pre&s;ent undertaking, with pointing out &s;ome of the u&s;es to which the truth thus far in|&s;i&s;ted on is to be applied.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VII. The U&s;es of the Doctrine.</HEAD>
<P>AS every truth of divine revelation is profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and in&s;tructi|on in righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o we may conclude, that tho&s;e truths are e&s;pecially u&s;eful, which are plainly declared, and frequently inculcated. Such I ap|prehend is the doctrine, which has thus far been treated of. To direct you to a right improvement and application of what has been delivered, &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, with which I &s;hall &s;hut up the whole argument. And as I have dwelt longer upon it than was intended, or expected, what remains mu&s;t be di&s;patched, with all po&s;&s;ible brevity. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may hence learn, in what manner &s;inners are to be addre&s;&s;ed, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the word. In general, the doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel mu&s;t be opened, vindicated and applied. But then the &s;pecial ca&s;es of different per&s;ons require particu|lar applications &s;uited to them. And it mu&s;t be the concern of <HI>the faithful and wi&s;e &s;teward, to give
<PB N="188" REF="010643_0187_0F81BD4315466170">
to every one his portion in due &s;ea&s;on. He mu&s;t &s;tu|dy to &s;hew him&s;elf approved of God, a workman that neeaeth not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of truth</HI> He mu&s;t endeavour to the be&s;t of his &s;kill, that each one may receive that in&s;truction, and attend to tho&s;e admonitions from the word of God, which are mo&s;t &s;uitable to his particular ca&s;e. The hearers of the go&s;pel are very apt to make a wrong application of divine truths. Particularly im|penitent &s;inners often comfort them&s;elves with pro|mi&s;es, which belong only to true believers. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that men be urged unto, and di|rected in the work of &s;elf-examination; cautioned again&s;t fal&s;e marks of grace, and the mi&s;application of true ones: And then per&s;ons are to he accu&s;&s;ed according to their different characters, with &s;uch in|&s;tructions and exhortations, as are be&s;t adapted to their ca&s;e and circum&s;tances. If we attend to the di&s;cour&s;es of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, (not to mention the prophets under the old te&s;tament) we may per|ceive a plain difference in their addre&s;s, when &s;peak|ing to &s;inners, and &s;aints. And we may and ought &s;urely to aim at the imitation of &s;uch unexeption|able patterns.</P>
<P>AS the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of &s;in and guilt, is greatly different from the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who <HI>being ju&s;tified by faith have peace with God;</HI> &s;o there is a manife&s;t difference between the &s;ecure, and the awakened &s;inner; which ought to be regarded in addre&s;&s;ing the coun&s;els of heaven to them. The fir&s;t thing to be attempted with the carele&s;s &s;inner, is to put him upon con&s;ideration, and convince him of his &s;in and danger. For 'till this is effected, the revelation of divine grace in the go&s;pel, de&s;igned for the comfort and relief of the guilty, will not be
<PB N="189" REF="010643_0188_0F81BD44239FEF20">
attended to, and cordially embraced. But when by the influence of the divine Spirit, a conviction of &s;in is fa&s;tened upon the con&s;cience, then the &s;inner mu&s;t be &s;olemnly reminded of the danger of relap&s;ing in|to his former carnal &s;ecurity; and accordingly he is to be cautioned again&s;t whatever has a tendency to harden the heart, &s;ear the con&s;cience, and quench the Spirit. The go&s;pel way of &s;alvation mu&s;t be plainly declared, the evidence and excellency of the &s;aving truth di&s;played, an hearty acquie&s;cence in the go&s;pel covenant urged, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upernatural influence in order to regeneration and conver&s;ion, mu&s;t be a&s;&s;erted. In fine, a diligent attendance on the means of grace mu&s;t be &s;o incul|cated and encouraged, as is be&s;t adapted to the de|&s;ign of God in pre&s;cribing them viz. that conviction and humiliation may be promoted, and the &s;inner led to Chri&s;t: Not that a &s;elf-righteous peace and &s;ecurity of con&s;cience be encouraged, or divine mercy expected as a congruous reward of human endeavours.</P>
<P>SOME it is likely will pervert &s;uch coun&s;els and directions to the encouragement of phari&s;aical pride, how cautious &s;oever we may be to guard again&s;t &s;uch an abu&s;e. But we ought notwithstanding <HI>to declare the whole coun&s;el of God, and keep back no|thing that may be profitable</HI> to the &s;ouls of men. The doctrine of free grace has al&s;o been abu&s;ed into an encouragement to &s;in; yet every chri&s;tian ought to a&s;&s;ert it, and contend for it. Whoever &s;o per|verts the go&s;pel, as to encourage him&s;elf either in a proud dependance upon his own righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength, or a carele&s;s neglect of duty, does it as his peril, and mu&s;t bear his iniquity.</P>

FROM what has been offered in the preceed|ing di&s;cour&s;es, it appears that they are to be reprov|ed, who indulge them&s;elves in a carele&s;s neglect of the means of grace, or labour for the meat which endureth to eternal life in other ways, or for other ends, than God has required; or who encourage others in &s;uch neglects and mi&s;takes.

<P>I NEED not, I ought not to make any apology, for addre&s;&s;ing you with all the boldne&s;s and plain|ne&s;s of reproof for your inexcu&s;able neglect of duty and intere&s;t. At the &s;ame time a poor &s;inner, who mu&s;t own, that the point and edge of the &s;evere things he has to &s;ay to others falls deeply upon him|&s;elf, ought not to glory over the mo&s;t obnoxious, or bring railing accu&s;ations again&s;t them; but re|member to pay all men that honour and re&s;pect which is due to them; <HI>In meekne&s;s in&s;tructing them that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if peradventure God will give them repentance; and that they may recover them|&s;elves out of the &s;nare of the evil, who are led cap|tive by him at his will.</HI></P>

thing required of them in a right manner: That it were as well to attempt nothing in a way of religious obedience, as not to act from gracious principles: That the prayers of the wicked are an abomination; and that <HI>God is found of them that &s;eek him not,</HI> &amp;c. And I wi&s;h there were no rea&s;on to complain of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, for teaching un&s;ound doctrines upon this head. The mo&s;t colourable pleas, whereby &s;inners may be tempted to quiet them&s;elves in a carele&s;s ne|glect of their &s;ouls &s;alvation, have been in &s;ome manner con&s;idered and confu&s;ed.

<P N="2">(2) WHAT has been offered on our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, may be applied for the reproof and cor|rection of tho&s;e, who though they take pains in &s;eeking &s;alvation, yet do not &s;eek in the way that God has pre&s;cribed. They make u&s;e of means of human invention, and not of divine in&s;titution. Of this error the church of Rome is to a great degree guilty, who&s;e religious &s;ervice is quite o|ver-run with &s;uper&s;tition &amp; will-wor&s;hip, yea with idolatry, and abominable wickedne&s;s. And ma|ny othrrs are to be reproved, for leaving the or|dinances and commands of God, and betaking them&s;elves to human inventions. We have no rea&s;on to hope, that God will accompany with

<P>THEY al&s;o are to be reproved, as not &s;eeking in the way of God's appointment, who allow them&s;elves in the neglect of &s;ome means which they are commanded to attend to, though they do not wholly neglect all. Our attending pub|lic ordinances, will not &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s of the more private duties of reading, meditation, and prayer. Nor will our ob&s;ervance of the&s;e, excu&s;e our for&s;aking the a&s;&s;emblies for publick wor&s;hip. And the mo&s;t punctual and exact attendance to devotional exerci&s;es public and private, does not di&s;pen&s;e with our obligation to watch and guard again&s;t temptations, &amp;c. Surely it is pre&s;umption for any to declare practi|cally a contempt of any divine ordinance, as u&s;e|le&s;s, or unnece&s;&s;ary. God will honour all his in|&s;titutions. And perhaps this is one great occa&s;i|on why <HI>many who &s;eek to enter in at the &s;trait gate are not able,</HI> viz. that they are not careful to avoid every thing which may be an impediment to their entrance, and u&s;e all tho&s;e means which God has pre&s;cribed, in order to their conver&s;ion and &s;al|vation.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THEIR error is al&s;o to be reproved, who propo&s;e wrong ends in their religious perfor|mances. This is a common mi&s;take, and of bad tendency. I grant that no unregenerate man acts
<PB N="194" REF="010643_0193_0F81BD4BCD49B3F0">
for holy ends: Yet it mu&s;t be maintained, that they are capable of acting for &s;uch ends as are in them&s;elves lawful and good, in their proper place, though corrupted by a &s;inful defect. And tho' this defect mu&s;t not in any mea&s;ure be counte|nanced, yet men may properly be exhorted and encouraged to do what is materially good from a defective end, rather than not do it at all; as has been formerly declared and vindicated.</P>
<P>WHILE we inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of human en|deavours, we mu&s;t take care not to countenance or abet the abu&s;e of them. This mu&s;t be te&s;ti|fied again&s;t and reproved with all confidence. And it &s;hould be the concern of every one, as he tenders his &s;oul's &s;alvation to guard again&s;t &s;o common and dangerous an error. In particular, they who by attending the means of grace are <HI>&s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or acquire a peculiar claim to the divine mercy, as &s;ubjects morally qualified for it, or worthy of it, may find matter of reproof and correction in the preceed|ing di&s;cour&s;es. While you act with &s;uch views as the&s;e, you do but <HI>&s;pend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which &s;atisfieth not.</HI> As the ca&s;e is with you at pre&s;ent, God does not require you to endeavour after, or even de|&s;ire any per&s;onal worthine&s;s, as a recommenda|tion to his favour, or meritorious ground of ju&s;ti|fication. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t &s;o fully and effectually an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of an atone|ment, and ran&s;om, and ground of acceptance, that all de&s;ires of contributing any thing hereto by our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, as co-efficient with
<PB N="195" REF="010643_0194_0F81BD4C98AD5260">
his merits, is now become not only vain, but criminal and pernicious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps it will be &s;aid, that if men unregenerate at|tempt any thing in a way of religious obedience, they will certainly and unavoidably act for &s;elf-righteous purpo&s;es. For they can propo&s;e no other ends. And it is in vain to exhort men to act while we take away the end of action. I an&s;wer this is not the place to di&s;pute the&s;e matters, and indeed it is unhappy that a &s;ubject &s;o important and practical has been &s;o em|barra&s;&s;ed with di&s;putes. But however let it be con|&s;idered, Fir&s;t. Suppo&s;ing that &s;inners do always act for &s;elf-righteous ends, their error is neverthele&s;s to be reproved. This is the fault, and not merely the un|happine&s;s of depraved nature. They are to be called to diligent endeavours, and at the &s;ame time every corruption or defect therein mu&s;t be duly te&s;tified a|gain&s;t. Perhaps believers are never quite free from the influence of a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit, in any acts of religious obedience. And it is certain that they are &s;infully deficient in their be&s;t duties. Yet they are to be pre&s;&s;ed to duties, notwith&s;tanding this corrupt alloy, which is however to be reproved, and they to be called upon to purge it out more and more. Secondly. Unregenerate men may, in attending the means of grace, act for other ends than to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God; even for &s;uch ends as however de|fective, are not in them&s;elves &s;imply unlawful. There are other motives to duty, be&s;ides the hope of work|ing out a ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s, which an un|regenerate man is capable of being influenced by. Thirdly. The work of conviction and humiliation u&s;ually proceeds gradually, as well as the work of &s;anctification. It is by degrees that men are brought off from their fal&s;e confidences. In &s;ome a &s;elf-righ|teous &s;pirit reigns without controul; in others it is much checked and di&s;turbed by conviction, and even wounded to death. A ju&s;t view of the divine law will do this, without a &s;aving belief of the go&s;pel. And when men begin to be convinced of the vanity of their fal&s;e confidences, they are capable of receiving reproof for their pa&s;t error, and of being upon their guard again&s;t deception for the time to come. And if they do &s;o, and continue attentive to the means of further light and conviction, there is rea&s;on to hope that they will at length come out of the darkne&s;s and delu&s;ion of a &s;tate of &s;in, into the light of a new and divine life. In fine, if the unregenerate are not to be directed to attend the appointed means of grace, le&s;t they &s;hould act from a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit, then neither ought they to neglect them, le&s;t their neglect &s;pring from the &s;ame principle. Some men may take as much pride in &s;itting &s;till, as others do in working. They may glory over phari&s;ees with the &s;ame &s;pirit, as phari&s;ees did over publicans.</NOTE></P>

Be attentive to the end of your actions, as well as to your actions them&s;elves. Guard again&s;t &s;uch an abu&s;e of the means of grace, as tends to fru&s;trate the grace of God, and the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, which is, <HI>that the loftine&s;s of man way be humbled, and the haughtine&s;s of men bowed down, and the Lord alone may be exalted.</HI><NOTE N="(b.)"

<P>CONSIDER, that if through a &s;lothful neglect of the means of conver&s;ion you &s;hould peri&s;h in your &s;ins, you will be peculiarly inexcu&s;able. You will have no pretence of inability, or want of en|couragement, to plead in extenuation of your guilt.<NOTE N="(c.)"

<P>HOWEVER men may at pre&s;ent quiet their con&s;cience, and ward off a conviction of their &s;in and folly, in neglecting to wait upon God for his mercy in the way he has appointed, you have no rea&s;on to expect that God &s;hould regenerate you,

while you will not attend to the outward and or|dinary means, whereby he is wont to effect this happy change.

And if any will do this, without in&s;ulting the a&s;hes of tho&s;e great and good men who have been of the contrary opinion, (&s;uch as the Briti&s;h Divines at the Synod of Dort, before quoted, Dr. Owen, Mr. Shep|ard, Mr. Edwards, &amp;c.) they &s;hall be attended to. But 'till this is done, it does not appear that the&s;e words in Ezekiel have been mi&s;under&s;tood at all, in being applied to the unregenerate, in the manner they commonly have been.

God may work miracles indeed in feeding a Prophet, or calling an Apo&s;tle, but the ordinary di&s;pen&s;ation of the ble&s;&s;ings of God's providence and grace is in another manner.</P>
<P>THE other part of the exhortation belongs e|&s;pecially to tho&s;e who have &s;ome &s;pecial oppor|tunities

and advantages of being &s;erviceable to others, in their &s;piritual intere&s;ts. Let &s;uch be per&s;waded to endeavour the conver&s;ion and &s;alva|tion of &s;ouls, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means and or|dinances which God has pre&s;cribed. It is no doubt <HI>the hearts de&s;ire and prayer of every</HI> true chri&s;tian for others, <HI>that they may be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> But con&s;ider, my brethren, that inoperative wi&s;hes do not di&s;|charge our obligation; no nor the mo&s;t fervent prayers to God, for the pouring out of his Spirit upon mankind for their conver&s;ion. There are means to be u&s;ed by every one of us for this pur|po&s;e. We mu&s;t labour that others, as well as our &s;elves, may obtain the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life. I know we cannot create a new heart in others; no more can we in our&s;elves. It belongs to God to make converts; but it belongs to us to u&s;e the means. May God im|print upon the hearts of all the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, a lively &s;en&s;e of their obligation <HI>to watch for &s;ouls, as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give account; that they way &s;ave them&s;elves and tho&s;e that hear them.</HI> And let parents and hou&s;holders &s;uffer the word of exhortation, to labour for the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e, who by the providence of God are e&s;pecially committed to their care. <HI>Bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: Train them in the way wherein they &s;hould go; and tra|vail in birth for them, 'till Christ be formed in their &s;ouls.

to the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> Re&s;train them from &s;in and temptation. Do what in you lies to engage them to an early acquaintance with God; and that they may <HI>remember their Creator,</HI> and Redeemer, <HI>in the days of their youth.</HI></P>
<P>IF you, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;hould be in&s;trumental to per&s;wade them to <HI>chu&s;e that bet|ter part which never &s;hall be taken away,</HI> how much better will they be provided for, than if you could give them all the world for their portion.

<P>BUT though your charity may properly begin at home, it &s;hould not end there. Can we take a view of the &s;ad &s;tate of the world, and not feel a tender compa&s;&s;ion towards &s;o many immortal creatures, in danger of peri&s;hing mi&s;erably. Let all chri&s;tians then contribute, in &s;uch ways as they are capable, to the propagation of the go&s;|pel among infidels. And let them <HI>exhort one another daily, le&s;t any be hardned through the de|ceitfulne&s;s of &s;in; let them cau&s;e their light to &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee their good works, and glorify God.</HI> But in what ways we are to labour for the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of our fellow men, cannot here be particularly declared.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="010643_0203_0F81BE93DB6A5750">GREAT and manifold are the motives, where|by the&s;e duties might be inculcated upon the con&s;cience of a chri&s;tian.
