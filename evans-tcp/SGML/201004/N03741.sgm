We ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> repre&s;ented in the Scripture as Pilgrims and Travellers a better Country; and as a <HI>wrong Choice of the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> may ruin us eternally, we ought to <HI>examine</HI> every Step we tread, and take Notice that our Guides be not blind nor <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> le&s;t they lead us a&s;tray. None can blame us when our Souls are in Danger of eternal Ruin, to look to our&s;elves, and to &s;ecure the one Thing needful; nor dare we allow our&s;elves to follow the Multitude, if we fear they go a&s;tray; nor regard any Man further than he fol|lows Chri&s;t: And we hope this will ju&s;tify us in what we have done in the following Pages; for, if all our Chri&s;ti|an Brethren, who may think worth while to read our Remarks, have &s;uch &s;uperior Attainments as to <HI>&s;ee clear|ly,</HI> that all that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has printed, is &s;ound and agreeable to the holy Scriptures; yet we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope that their chri&s;tian Charity is &s;o great, that they will not con|demn us for applying as we have done to our Teachers, and by their Advice, to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> him&s;elf, to remove &s;ome unhappy Stumbling-Blocks out of our Way. We can|not help thinking for our&s;elves, and judging of Things ac|cording to the Light they appear in; and we promi&s;e, that when that Gentleman &s;atisfies us in the&s;e Things, we will be|lieve him; and we <HI>cannot</HI> do it &s;ooner.

their Souls, and will look on it as the mo&s;t eminent Service can be done them, if by our Means they receive a Kindne&s;s that will turn to their Account, through a boundle&s;s Eternity.</P>
<P>We confe&s;s, that we are at a Lo&s;s to know what to make of &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions; if they have <HI>any Mean|ing at all,</HI> we fear that it is a bad one; and will rejoice to find our&s;elves di&s;appointed, if he &s;hews us that they are &s;ound and good. But if he pretends Hurry or Want of Time, and <HI>does not either ju&s;tify</HI> or <HI>condemn them,</HI> or give us <HI>&s;ome Satisfaction,</HI> he will <HI>con&s;train</HI> us to think, that he has his own <HI>Glory</HI> in View more than the <HI>Glory</HI> of God or the <HI>Good</HI> of his Church. He has &s;uch <HI>high</HI> Conceptions of Man, or &s;uch <HI>low</HI> Conceptions of God, that we fear he has <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Conceptions of neither; to &s;ay, "That Man was adorned <HI>with all</HI> the Perfections of the Deity, that he was the Perfection of the <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>material</HI> World," as he does, <HI>Page 17, Vol. 2d. of Sermons,</HI> is what we can <HI>neither believe,</HI> nor find ground from Rea|&s;on nor Revelation to &s;upport it. When our Divines prove the Divinity of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, they &s;ometimes do it <HI>(we think to good Purpo&s;e)</HI> by proving, that the Scriptures attribute to him <HI>all the Perfections of the Deity,</HI> and of Con&s;equence, that he is the eternal God, equal with the Father and Holy Spirit; but if a <HI>meer Man</HI> may be adorned with <HI>all the&s;e Perfections,</HI> we know not what to make of this Argument, 'till he give us better Light. &mdash; Again, if Men be baptized <HI>into the Nature</HI> of the Fa|ther, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, as he &s;eems to a&s;&s;ert, <HI>p. 128, vol. 2.</HI> is not this to make them, on their Conver&s;ion, Partakers of the Godhead, or &s;omeway equal to the &s;u|pream Being? What &s;hall we think of the Doctrine, that one while <HI>&s;inks us</HI> into <HI>Brutes and Devils,</HI> and again <HI>ex|alts</HI> us to be equal to <HI>God?</HI> This puts us in Mind of &s;ome <HI>Antinomian</HI> Reveries, of being goded with God, and chri&s;ted with Chri&s;t: And we hope the Readers will par|don us, tho' we de&s;ire to get Light in the&s;e Things, &s;eeing it is our great Concern to have <HI>right Notions</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and to <HI>act</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="004586_0004_100D6AB7186BF7E8">When we hear him tell us, "That the Regenerate wa&s;hes away the Guilt of Sin <HI>by the Tears</HI> of a &s;incere Repentance, <HI>joined with</HI> Faith in the Blood of Chri&s;t," <HI>p. 22, 23, vol. 2.</HI> we think that it &s;avours of <HI>Popery and Arminiani&s;m,</HI> to join any Thing with the Blood of Chri&s;t to wa&s;h away Sin; and hope it will offend none, that we cannot believe this on his <HI>bare Word</HI> contrary to many Scripture Texts, for we abhor an implicite Faith. Is not that Expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame <HI>Stamp? Vol. 1, p. 79,</HI> Where he &s;ays, "That a &s;ingle Aim at God's Glory,&mdash; <HI>alone</HI> can render our Actions <HI>acceptable</HI> in God's Sight:" If a &s;ingle Aim at God's Glory <HI>alone</HI> can render our Acti|ons acceptable in his Sight, what need is there for the Blood of Chri&s;t? We hope none of our Brethren will be of|fended, that we cannot believe this <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Doctrine, till he explain or prove it from Scripture. &mdash; He further tells us, <HI>p. 128, vol. 2.</HI> (if we mi&s;take him not) "That our Lord commanded his Di&s;ciples to baptize Men <HI>into</HI> the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t," which is either to convert them, or rather to make them equal with God: And if he has given Men <HI>Ability</HI> to do either the one or the other, by repeating the Words of the In&s;titution; Why <HI>may</HI> they not as ca&s;tly change a Wafer into his Body and Blood? And this <HI>&s;mells of Popery,</HI> and will <HI>&s;upport</HI> the Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. &mdash; When he tells us, "That we mu&s;t be ju&s;tified by the inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t," if by this he intends our Sanctification, or good Habits, and good Works performed by the Aid of the Spirit, does not he here again give another <HI>fair Invitation</HI> to bring us to <HI>Rome?</HI> And we hope we will be excu&s;ed from <HI>&s;etting</HI> our Face <HI>that Way,</HI> till we be once convin|ced, that it is the <HI>&s;ure Road</HI> to eternal Happine&s;s.

<P>_THE venerable and &s;acred Character the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> bears, as an incomparable Reformer; and the high Commendations given to his publick Performances and Writings, both from the Pulpit and Pre&s;s, as well as in pri|vate Conference, and that, by &s;ome Mini&s;ters and People of our own Denomination, having rai&s;ed our Expectations very high, we were induced to attend his Sermons, and to read and peru&s;e his Books, hoping to receive much Light and Benefit thereby: But, upon the be&s;t Peru&s;al we could make of them, albeit, we find that a great Part of his Writings do an&s;wer the Cha|racter given them, as being &s;ound, yet, to our great Sur|prize, we every now and then &s;tumble upon &s;omething that &s;eems to jar with tho&s;e &s;ounder Parts, as well as with o|ther good Books; and, if we be not much mi&s;taken, with Scripture and &s;ound Rea&s;on.&mdash;Our Jealou&s;ies hereanent, whether Right or Wrong, giving us &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, we were much perplexed what to do: If we &s;hould think of going to &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s warm Ad|herents, we were afrai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by rea&s;on of the Treatment that others (and it may be &s;ome of our&s;elves) met with, that nothing could be expected thereby, but incen&s;ing

It is true, God the Father did enter into a Second Covenant (and that from all Eternity) with the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> the God-Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in our &s;tead: But it can|not be proved, that he made any Second Covenant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf, or any of his Po&s;terity.</Q></P>
<P>Before we come to propo&s;e Queries on this Head, it may not be ami&s;s to premi&s;e a Word or two, to prevent Mi&s;takes, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. We freely grant that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is our Second <HI>Adam,</HI> our common Head and Surety in the Second Co|venant, and that the Fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was only a private Belie|ver or Per&s;on, and &s;o mu&s;t come in, or enter into Cove|nant with God by or thro' a Mediator, and at a Second Hand (if we may &s;o &s;peak) as well as we his Po&s;terity. And when we read the 16th Paragraph of the Preface of that 'fore cited Book, we cannot but judge that the Author thereof doth fully own this, when he &s;aith, <Q>For tho' by that Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> all Mankind were under the Sentence of eternal Condemnation, yet it plea&s;ed God &s;o far to pity our Mi&s;ery, as to give us his Son, and in him to make a new Covenant with us, after we had broken the Fir&s;t.</Q> Thus far the Author &s;eems &s;ound enough.</P>
<P>Whether the next Paragraph that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> condemns may bear a favourable Con&s;truction, we leave you to judge; but we cannot but heartily join with him in &s;hewing our Di&s;like to what&s;oever in <HI>any Author</HI> may <HI>mi&s;lead</HI> the <HI>Weak</HI> or <HI>Ignorant,</HI> or <HI>countenance</HI> the <HI>Erroneous:</HI>

Yet, whether this may lay a Foundation for &s;uch a <HI>hard Cen&s;ure</HI> as that he was not a <HI>Real Chri&s;tian</HI> at <HI>Heart,</HI> or had not &s;o much as a <HI>Head Knowledge</HI> of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> a&s;&s;erts, is what we are at a Lo&s;s to determine? How would Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or &s;ome of his warm Adherents, like it, if another would take the &s;ame Liberty to cen&s;ure his Writings, and him for them, to the &s;ame Degree? Upon the like Ground, we mu&s;t, and do condemn the Author of <HI>The Whole Duty Duty of Man,</HI> for A&s;&s;erting that the Second Covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, if thereby is meant, his being our Publick Head and Surety in the Second Covenant. And may not we al&s;o condemn Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> for running into another Extreme and an Error, that &s;eems as dangerous as this, in A&s;&s;erting that God never made any Second Covenant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf, or any of his Po&s;terity?
