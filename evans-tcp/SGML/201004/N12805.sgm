<HEAD>A Vindication &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE very extraordinary demand which the go|vernment of the State of <HI>New-York</HI> make on the grand Congre&s;s of the United States, to forthwith to de|cide in their favor, (and as they would have it <HI>ex-part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that long and &s;pirited controver&s;y which has &s;ub&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> between them and the inhabitants of the territory no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> known by the name of <HI>Vermont,</HI> together with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|repre&s;entations of facts, has induced the government o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Vermont,</HI> to publi&s;h to the impartial world, a further vindication of the conduct of tho&s;e inhabitants than hath been already done, and exhibit to all wi&s;e and under|&s;tanding Beings whom it may concern, the intrin&s;ic cau&s;es, motives and rea&s;ons, of their a&s;&s;uming govern|ment.</P>
<P>IT is well known that this conte&s;t was not occa&s;ioned by the late revolution, but exi&s;ted many years before that the contending parties were greatly exa&s;perated to|wards each other; and that tho&s;e inhabitants had ap|pealed from the deci&s;ion of the courts, as by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the then province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to arms, and had anounced to the public their rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>A SHORT &s;tate of the proceedings of both parties (be|ing nece&s;&s;ary to communicate to the public, in order to their rightly determining the merits of &s;uch an important di&s;pute) is herewith given. And 1&s;t. The government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtained the juri&s;diction of the conte&s;ted
<PB N="4" REF="016183_0004_0F9BCC145662C620">territory in 1764, ex-parte and contrary to the minds of the original Grantees and Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and therefore ought to be con&s;idered as null and void from the beginning. And &s;econdly, The undue u&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e which they have ever &s;ince made of the power of juri&s;diction towards tho&s;e inhabitants, al|tho' their legal claim of juri&s;diction was ever &s;o well grounded, would fully ju&s;tify tho&s;e inhabitants in their oppo&s;ition to that government, and in their a&s;&s;uming independence.</P>
<P>NO SOONER had the government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtain|ed the juri&s;diction of the&s;e lands, but they pre&s;umed to re-grant &s;undry large patents, interfering with prior grants from the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> at a time when the Grantees under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> were in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the very lands re-granted.</P>
<P>THIS reprehen&s;ible procedure of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid tho&s;e inhabitants under the nece&s;&s;ity of remon&s;trating again&s;t that government. They therefore impowered <HI>Samuel Robin&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (then of <HI>Bennington</HI>) their Agent, to lay the &s;ame before the King and privy Council, together with a humble Petition from tho&s;e in|habitants, that the juri&s;diction of tho&s;e lands might be re&s;tored to <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> again. The con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures were favorable to the Grantees under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and were the means of obtaining the King's expre&s;s prohibition to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to make no grants of lands in the di&s;puted pre|mi&s;es, on pain of his <HI>highe&s;t</HI> di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE government of <HI>New-York</HI> did, neverthele&s;s pre|&s;ume in direct violation of the &s;aid prohibition, to grant mo&s;t of the prohibitted premi&s;es: and further proceeded to oppo&s;e the authority of the king, by erecting and
<PB N="5" REF="016183_0005_0F9BCC1510ABEDD8">e&s;tabli&s;hing the counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> which are contained in the territory in di&s;pute, though the king had &s;ignified to the &s;aid government, his utter di&s;approbation of the e&s;tabli&s;hment thereof. And all this when the now Independent States were &s;ubject to the royal authority.</P>
<P>IN the year 1769, the claimants under the &s;ub&s;equent grants from <HI>New-York,</HI> and not re&s;iding on the contro|verted premi&s;es, brought action of Ejectment in their &s;upreme Court held at <HI>Albany,</HI> again&s;t &s;undry actual &s;et|tlers who claimed the &s;oil by virtue of prior grants from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> But mo&s;t if not all the judges and at|torn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es (particularly Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Duane</HI> and <HI>Kemp</HI>) which attended the court, were patentees under <HI>New-York;</HI> and &s;ome of them intru&s;ted in the very patents, then on trial.</P>
<P>The plantiffs appearing in great &s;tate and magnifi|cence, which together with their junto of land thieves, made a brilliant appearance; but the defendants ap|pearing in but ordinary fa&s;hion, having been greatly fatigued by hard labour wrought on the di&s;puted pre|mi&s;es, and their ca&s;h much exhau&s;ted, made a very di&s;|proportionable figure at court. In fine, intere&s;t, con|nection and grandeur, being all on one &s;ide, ea&s;ily turn|ed the &s;cale again&s;t the hone&s;t defendants, and judgment without mercy in favor of the claimants under <HI>New-York</HI> was given again&s;t them. In the cour&s;e of the tri|al, a grant of the town&s;hip from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> under which the defendants claimed being produced in court, and al&s;o a certificate from the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> and his Secretary, that the &s;aid grant was legally executed to the grantees who&s;e names were mentioned on the back of the charter, it was neverthele&s;s ruled that the &s;ame &s;hould not be read in court.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016183_0006_0F9BCC15CF36D238">
SOON after, writs of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were i&s;&s;ued in form of law again&s;t the vanqui&s;hed defendants, and new actions of ejectment were commenced again&s;t other of the in|habitants; but their &s;pirit was too great to bear &s;uch in&s;ults any longer; they therefore re&s;i&s;ted and defeated the officers in their attempts to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>DIRECTLY after the&s;e tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the legi&s;lature of <HI>New-York</HI> pa&s;&s;ed a law annexing a penalty of thirty pounds fine and &s;ix Months impri&s;onment, on any of their &s;ubjects who &s;hould refute to a&s;&s;i&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;heriff when legal|ly reque&s;ted, to carry into execution tho&s;e writs of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS law had no &s;ooner been promulgated, but Go|vernor <HI>Tryon</HI> who then p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed over the government, gave orders to the militia of <HI>Albany</HI> county, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;heriff in executing the writs afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants being thus drove to the extremity of either quitting their po&s;i&s;&s;ions or re&s;i&s;ting the &s;heriff and his po&s;&s;e. In this &s;tate of de&s;paracy they put on forti|tude and cho&s;e the latter expedient, and managed with that bravery that they defended their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the &s;heriff with his po&s;&s;e returned to their own land without any blood&s;hed on the occa&s;ion. But it &s;hould be confe&s;&s;ed that this event was not altogether owing to the valour of the <HI>green mountain boys,</HI> for the militia were mo&s;t generally per&s;uaded that the cau&s;e of tho&s;e inhabi|tants was ju&s;t; and that the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees were oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t, and therefore they would not hazard their lives to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch u&s;urpation of the rights of their fellow men, and in the event were &s;ure to be no gainers turn which way it would.</P>
<P>AFTER this ineffectual mu&s;ter of the militia, the land &s;chemers adopted different mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h their
<PB N="7" REF="016183_0007_0F9BCC1692049C20">de&s;igns, perceiving that the militia would not fight for their &s;ub&s;equent and exorbitant claims; and as to them|&s;elves, they were a je&s;uitical and cowardly junto of &s;chemers, not inured to danger, hard&s;hips, or the hor|rors of war, dur&s;t not fight for their own claim; their accu&s;tomed way to carry points being to deceive, cheat, and over reach the commonality of their &s;pecies under pretext of law, ju&s;tice, and good government. The&s;e are their horns of iron, and with them they do pu&s;h. They were therefore obliged to follow their old and beaten road of politics; and by their influence cau&s;ed a number of the leading men among tho&s;e inhabitants, to be indicted as rioters, de&s;igning to have made &s;uch an example of them, as to fright the inhabitants in general to a tame compliance with the deci&s;ions of their courts of law, or which is the &s;ame thing, to yield up their property to them, and become their tenants and &s;laves.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants in general were appri&s;ed that this was their de&s;ign, and guarded again&s;t it; were very ac|tive and vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent in defending their friends and neigh|bours indicted as afore&s;aid; being fully per&s;uaded that the &s;aid junto of patentees had in tho&s;e very indictments for their object, the very lands which they the afore&s;aid inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>SUNDRY proclamations under the &s;ignature of gover|nor <HI>Tryon</HI> were i&s;&s;ued, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of appre|hending tho&s;e inhabitants which he was plea&s;ed to deno|minate riotous, licentious, di&s;orderly, &amp;c. and large re|wards therein were offered for that purpo&s;e; but the governor and whole catalogue of patentees, had the mortification to be baffled in their attempts to take ri|oters (as they phra&s;ed it) during the cour&s;e of three years; and the green mountain boys prevailed again&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="016183_0008_0F9BCC17617BE258">them, &s;eized their magi&s;trates and emi&s;aries; and in fine, all tho&s;e their abettors which dared to venture upon the conte&s;ted lands, and cha&s;ti&s;ed them with the whips of the wilderne&s;s, the growth of the land which they co|veted.</P>
<P>AND on the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, the legi&s;lative authority of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did pa&s;s twelve acts of outlawry, again&s;t tho&s;e inhabitants, and they on their part publi&s;hed a declaration of a defen&s;ive war, a|gain&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the 26th day of <HI>April</HI> following; and extended their &s;ettlements and emigrants from <HI>New-England,</HI> increa&s;ed their power, and they built fortifications in their frontier &s;ettlements, again&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and garri&s;oned them, and pro&s;pered until the late <HI>glorious revolution.</HI></P>
<P>A PARTICULAR hi&s;tory of this controver&s;y from the commencement of it down to this aera, having been written by the writer of this vindication, and publi&s;hed in 1774. Intitled <HI>A brief Narrative of the proceedings of the government of</HI> New-York <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will be therefore needle&s;s, as al&s;o too prolix, to give the contents a place in this; and for this rea&s;on &s;ome memorable parts of it only are &s;ubjoined: and to the whole is added as an ap|pendix, nine &s;ections of the &s;ame; holding forth a clear confutation of a <HI>New-Yorki&s;h</HI> doctrine, recently propa|gated, of an antient right or theirs to the juri&s;diction of the territory in di&s;pute, with a chain of arguments cal|culated on an exten&s;ive &s;cale, and predicated on unde|niable facts; evincing that the right of &s;oil to the lands contained in the limits of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire Grants</HI> was conveyed to the grantees, by virtue of the re&s;pective grants; that their right to the lands therein contained is indefea&s;ible; and that the royal adjudication of the
<PB N="9" REF="016183_0009_0F9BCC1A122A2968">boundary line between the governments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;hould have operated as a line of juri&s;diction only, and not in any mea&s;ure to effect the property of the &s;ubject. Without the con&s;ideration of the&s;e arguments on the right of ti|tle of tho&s;e lands, a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion on the contro|ver&s;y cannot be drawn; for if tho&s;e &s;ettlements were an intru&s;ion on the right of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it would in a great mea&s;ure extenuate their conduct towards them; but if on the grounds of ju&s;tice and &s;olid argument the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants are good and valid, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity invalidate the <HI>New-York</HI> interfering grants, and leave that go|vernment no excu&s;e for their abu&s;e to tho&s;e inhabi|tants. This we refer to the public and proceed to the later &s;tages of the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THE approaching rupture between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>Colonies</HI> was matter of &s;erious reflection to the inhabitants of this frontier; their controver&s;y with <HI>New-York,</HI> having (at a great expence) been previou&s;ly &s;ubmitted to the king and privy council, by the negociation of &s;pecial agents at two different times, and was in a high probability of being de|termined in their favor; which influenced &s;ome of the inhabitants to take a part with <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> the more &s;o, as this part of the country was a fron|tier, and of con&s;equence would be greatly under the enemy's power, who was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ticon|deroga, Crown-Point</HI> and St. <HI>Johns,</HI> and commanded the lake with a ve&s;&s;el of force be&s;ides. At the &s;ame time their &s;ettlements were extended on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake almo&s;t to the province of <HI>Quebec.</HI> This
<PB N="10" REF="016183_0010_0F9BCC1A4FEB12C0">was their &s;ituation when on the very eve of a war with <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE battle of <HI>Lexington</HI> almo&s;t di&s;tracted them, for intere&s;t inclined them to favor the royal &s;ide of the di&s;pute, but the &s;tronger impul&s;es of affection to their country, excited them to re&s;ent its wrongs, and obtain &s;atisfaction for the blood of their ma&s;&s;a|cre'd countrymen. Their condition was truly per|plexed and critical: their hopes were placed on the royal authority for their deliverance from the in|croachments and oppre&s;&s;ions of the government of <HI>New-York;</HI> but the ties of con&s;anguinity, per&s;onal acquaintance and friend&s;hip, &s;imilarity of religion and manners to the <HI>New-England</HI> governments from whom the&s;e inhabitants had mo&s;t generally emigra|ted, weighed very heavy in their deliberations; be|&s;ides, the cau&s;e of the country was generally believed to be ju&s;t; and that re&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had become the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of a free people. But there was one very knotty query, which exerci&s;ed the minds of their be&s;t politicians, viz. Provided they &s;hould take an active part with their country. And furthermore. Provided an accommodation &s;hould take place, and the colonies return to their former allegiance, what would then become of them or their remon&s;trances again&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> lodged at the court of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> but this danger &s;eems to have been luckily pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>SOON after the news of the <HI>Lexington</HI> battle, the principal officers of the green montain boys, and o|ther principal inhabitants were convened at <HI>Benning|ton,</HI> and attempted to explore futurity, but it was found to be unfathomable; and the &s;cences which
<PB N="11" REF="016183_0011_0F9BCC1B1210E890">have &s;ince taken place, then appeared to be precari|ous and uncertain. However, it was imagined that provided tho&s;e inhabitants were loyal to their coun|try, and the event of the war &s;hould prove favora|ble to <HI>America,</HI> and their &s;truggles for liberty &s;hould bring about a revolution in &s;tead of a rebellion; that in this ca&s;e they &s;hould rid them&s;elves of the grievous u&s;urpation of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and be entitled and readily admitted to any privileges which could rea&s;onably be expected on revolution principles, which undoubtedly will be the con&s;equence; (for it can hardly be doubted, that provided the &s;aid inhabitants had exerci&s;ed the &s;ame degree of loyalty to the king that they have to the country, they might have &s;hared as great privileges from the royal favor, as they now reque&s;t of Con|gre&s;s, viz. Provided the event of the war had prov|ed as &s;ucce&s;sful to <HI>Britain</HI> as it has to <HI>America.</HI>) And as every of the colonies and plantations were then taking arms for the mutual &s;ecurity of their li|berty; and it was equally ju&s;t and incumbant on the inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, to do the &s;ame. It was therefore re&s;erved to take an ac|tive part with the country, and thereby annihilate the old quarrel with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> by &s;wallowing it up in the general conflict for liber|ty; at that time not apprehending the lea&s;t danger (on the provi&s;o of a revolution's taking place) that congre&s;s would re&s;olve them to belong to the go|vernment of <HI>New-York;</HI> or in any manner counte|nance their being deprived of their liberty by &s;ub|jecting them under the power of a government which they dete&s;t more than that of the Briti&s;h,
<PB N="12" REF="016183_0012_0F9BCC1BD13DC9B0">which they have manfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted the United States to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT the enemy having the command of lake <HI>Champlain</HI> and the garri&s;ons contiguous to it, was ground of great unea&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e inhabitants who had extended their &s;ettlements on the rivers <HI>Otter|creek,</HI> and <HI>Onion</HI>-river, and along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake afore&s;aid, who, in con&s;equence of a war, would be under the power of the enemy. It was therefore projected to &s;urpri&s;e the garri&s;ons of <HI>Ticonderoga</HI> and <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> with the armed ve&s;&s;el in the lake, and gain the command of that important pa&s;s; in as much as &s;uch an event would in a great mea&s;ure &s;e|cure tho&s;e inhabitants from the enemy, obliging them to take po&s;t in <HI>Canada:</HI> but whether &s;uch a mea&s;ure would be agreeable to congre&s;s or not they could not for certain determine. But it was appre|hended that if tho&s;e po&s;ts were not &s;oon taken they would be &s;trongly reinforced, and become impreg|nable to any attack &s;hort of a regular &s;iege, for which, at that time, the country were very deficient in the articles of artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e matters were deliberating, a com|mittee from the council of <HI>Connecticut</HI> arrived at <HI>Bennington,</HI> with advice and directions to carry into execution the &s;urpri&s;e of tho&s;e garri&s;ons; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain the command of the lake. Which was done without lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>DURING near two years in the fir&s;t of the war with <HI>Britain,</HI> the inhabitants of the&s;e conte&s;ted lands go|verned them&s;elves, and managed their internal po|lice under the direction of committees and conventi|ons, as they had done from the commencement of their
<PB N="13" REF="016183_0013_0F9BCC1C93A18728">controver&s;y with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> a &s;mall number of the inhabitants excepted, who are &s;ituate in the &s;outhea&s;t corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> county, who adhere to the government la&s;t mentioned, and are part of them tories.</P>
<P>ON the 15th day of <HI>January</HI> 1777, the inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants to the we&s;tward of <HI>Con|necticut</HI>-river, at a general convention, abrogated their former modes of government, <HI>viz.</HI> by com|mittees and conventions, and declared them&s;elves A FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATE, and have formed their con&s;titution and mode of government, elected their officers both civil and military; and made and e&s;tabli&s;hed a code of laws for the future government of the State.</P>

A PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the Senate and A&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate, <NOTE PLACE="marg">L.

<P>THAT the &s;aid conte&s;t was occa&s;ioned partly by the i&s;&s;uing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the re&s;pective governments of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the one part, and tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> on the other, antecedent to the late e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the ea&s;tern boundary of this &s;tate; part|ly by an higher quit-rent re&s;erved on the &s;aid lands, when re-granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> than were re&s;erv|ed in the original grants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> and the exorbitant fees of office accruing thereon; and partly by a number of grants made by the late government of <HI>New-York</HI> after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;aid ea&s;tern boundary, for lands which had been before granted by the governments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> re&s;pective|ly, or one of them; in which la&s;t mentioned grants by the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the intere&s;t of the &s;ervants of the crown, and of new adventurers, was, in many in&s;tances, contrary to ju&s;tice and po|licy,

<P>THIS proclamation, after mentioning a di&s;af|fection of many per&s;ons inhabiting the northea&s;t parts of the county of <HI>Albany,</HI> and certain parts of the counties of <HI>Charlotte, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="016183_0020_0F9BCC23D35A0678">proceeds to affirm that the&s;e tracts of country were clearly included within the ancient, original, true and lately e&s;tabli&s;hed bounds of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>THAT many, nay, almo&s;t the whole of the inha|bitants in tho&s;e counties, <HI>alias,</HI> the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> are di&s;affected to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> will not be di&s;puted. This is a fact: But it is not a fact, that the ancient, original and true bounds of <HI>New-York</HI> included tho&s;e lands. The fir&s;t intimation that ever &s;aluted the ears of the public, a&s;&s;erting this doctrine, was, from a proclamation of governor <HI>Tryon</HI>'s, dated the 11th day of <HI>December,</HI> 1771, which begins thus: <Q>Whereas, it is the ancient and incon|te&s;tible right of this colony, to extend to <HI>Connec|ticut</HI>-river as its ea&s;tern boundary.</Q> This a&s;&s;er|tion hath been an&s;wered at large in my Treati&s;e on the Conduct of this Government towards the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers, to which I refer the reader, and at pre&s;ent ob&s;erve, that as the quoted a&s;&s;ertions in the&s;e proclamations, are wholly without foundation, they need only to be as po&s;itively denied as they are a&s;&s;erted. The fact is, that the tract of land which now comprehends the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> was univer&s;ally known to be in the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> Thus it was placed by all Geographers in their maps, 'till the year 1764, when the now <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King, for certain polical rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall mention, extended the juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York</HI> over the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni&s;es, by his &s;pecial royal authority. At the time of the alteration of this juri&s;diction, jea|lou&s;ies had fir'd the minds of king and parliament again&s;t the growth and ri&s;ing power of <HI>America,</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="016183_0021_0F9BCC2410A26858">at this time they began to advance men and govern|ments into power, with a political de&s;ign to cru&s;h the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>America. New York</HI> had ever been their favorite government: They could almo&s;t vie with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the art of va&s;&s;alaging common people, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ing every idea of liberty from the human mind, by making and keeping them poor and &s;ervile. This <HI>Great Britain</HI> well knew, and therefore &s;heed a large territory from <HI>New-Hamp|shire,</HI> and a&s;ided it to <HI>New-York,</HI> to depre&s;s the pow|er of the one, and enlarge and extend the other. A well concerted plan: But the <HI>green mountain boys</HI> di&s;concerted it, by throwing their weight in to the &s;cale of congre&s;s, which, thank GOD, has fairly ponderated. Thus may be &s;een the de&s;ign, as well as date, of the original, ancient and true bounds of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI>'s being extended over the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont;</HI> and for the &s;ame rea&s;on it was thus extended by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it will undoubtedly be curtailed by congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the acts of outlawry, mentioned in the proclamation, they died a natural death the fir&s;t day of <HI>January</HI> 1776, as may be &s;een from the act it&s;elf, here quoted: <Q>And be it further enacted by the authority afore&s;aid, that this act &s;hall remain and continue in full force and effect, from the pa&s;&s;ing thereof, until the fir&s;t day of <HI>January,</HI> which will be in the year of our Lord, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> were under no apprehen&s;ions from the&s;e old lifele&s;s acts: Nor do I conceive, that the pre&s;ent legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI> have laid them under any obliga|tion,

<P>THE &s;econd article is as follows: <Q>That all per|&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and improving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, &s;hall be con|firmed in their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, together with &s;uch additional quantity of vacant land, ly|ing contiguous to each re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as may be nece&s;&s;ary to form the &s;ame into a conveni|ent farm, &s;o as the quantity of land to be confirm|ed to each re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hall not exceed three hundred acres.</Q></P>

<P>THESE Overtures have hitherto been con&s;idered only in a grammatical and logical &s;en&s;e, allowing
<PB N="25" REF="016183_0025_0F9BCC27189CE740">them their own con&s;truction; I now proceed to con|&s;ider them in a law &s;en&s;e. A legi&s;lative authority, within its own juri&s;diction, may confirm a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on vacant land, by making a grant of the &s;ame to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: But, for the legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> to pretend as they do in their proclamation, to vacate any grants, made by their own authority, in favor of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to confirm &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by nullifying and defearing their own grants, is the height of folly and &s;tupidi|ty: For, the lands being once granted, the proper|ty pa&s;&s;eth to the grantee, who is become the &s;ole proprietor of the &s;ame; and he is as independent of that legi&s;lative authority which granted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as any per&s;on may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, who purcha&s;eth a farm of land of me by deed of conveyance; and it is as much out of the power of that legi&s;lature to vacate a grant made by them, or the &s;ame authori|ty, in favor of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as it is out of my power to vacate my deed of conveyance in favor of &s;ome &s;econd per&s;on. It is contrary to common &s;en&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, that the property of the &s;ubject is at the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of the legi&s;lature: If it was, they might give a grant to day, and vacate it to morrow, and &s;o on, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> This would de|&s;troy the very nature and exi&s;tance of per&s;onal pro|perty, as the whole would depend on the &s;overeign will and la&s;t act of the legi&s;lature: But the train of the matter is, the fir&s;t conveyance will, and ought to hold good; and this defeats all &s;ub&s;equent con|veyances.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it ap|pears, that the overtures in the proclamation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="26" REF="016183_0026_0F9BCC27D1441AE0">forth, are either romantic, or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general, may not be &s;uppo&s;|ed to under&s;tand law, or the power of a legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>I HAVE further to evince my arguments on this &s;ubject, by the concurring opinion of the Lords of the Board of Trade, on complaint made to them from tho&s;e very per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the land we are &s;peaking of. That clau&s;e of their report which is &s;imilar to what I have argued, is in the&s;e words: <Q>Such &s;ub&s;equent grants made by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> however unwarrantable, cannot be &s;et a&s;ide by any authority from his maje&s;ty, in ca&s;e the grantees &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on their title.</Q></P>
<P>THUS it appears, in a trial (of the &s;ame ca&s;e we are treating of) before the board of trade, that the king, under who&s;e authority the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had, in an oppre&s;&s;ive manner granted tho&s;e very lands, could not, by his royal authority, vacate or &s;et a&s;ide the grants; yet the pre&s;ent legi&s;|lative authority of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> proclaim to the world, and pledge the faith of government, that they will do it. But enough has been &s;aid on the impo&s;&s;ibility of it, as well as on the ungenerou&s;|ne&s;s of the propo&s;al: And as to the quit-rents, the General A&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> will de|termine their expediency, and probably relea&s;e them all.</P>
<P>WHAT has been ob&s;erved, an&s;wers every part of the proclamation worth notice, as the five la&s;t arti|cles had an entire reference to the three fir&s;t; though it may be worth ob&s;erving, that the time of compli|ance with tho&s;e overtures are run out, and it is my
<PB N="27" REF="016183_0027_0F9BCC289460F310">opinion, that but few of the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> have clo&s;ed with them. The main induce|ment I had in an&s;wering them was, to draw a full and convincing proof from the &s;ame, that the &s;hort|e&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t eligible, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the only po&s;&s;ible way of vacating tho&s;e <HI>New-York</HI> inter|fering grants, is, to maintain inviolable the &s;upre|macy of the legi&s;lative authority of the independent &s;tate of <HI>Vermont.</HI> This, at one &s;troke, overturns every <HI>New-York</HI> &s;cheme which may be calculated for our ruin, makes us free men, confirms our pro|perty, "and puts it fairly in our power to help our|&s;elves" to the enjoyment of the great ble&s;&s;ings of a free, uncorrupted and virtuous civil government.</P>

IT is apprehended that what has been already an|imadverted on the fir&s;t of the&s;e proclamations, a|mounts to a clear refutation of the e&s;&s;ential parts of both; e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the granting and &s;ettling tho&s;e lands, but to the public in general, who are not. The an&s;wer is not &s;ufficiently explanatory: we have therefore thought it expedient, to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me addi|tional ob&s;ervations on the fir&s;t of them, with a full an&s;wer to the latter. Ina&s;much as the leading gen|tlemen of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in both public and private company, when di&s;cu&s;&s;ing on the controver&s;y, do not he&s;itate, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner, to affirm, and &s;take their honor, that their government have really offered (tho&s;e deluded peo|ple) the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> a full and authentic confirmation of their lands granted by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay;</HI> but that they are, ne|verthele&s;s, "refractory and licentiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed." The truth of this matter mu&s;t be learnt from &s;uch part of the afore&s;aid proclamations called overtures, which is all that ever have been pretended to be made from that government to tho&s;e inhabitants.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Clinton</HI>'s fir&s;t proclamation begins with an air of penitence, pointing out a number of grievances, which he admits tho&s;e inhabitants "have laboured under, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, extenuate their offence, and which ought to be redre&s;&s;ed." This then is the point at i&s;&s;ue, whether tho&s;e over|tures are calculated for that purpo&s;e, or are adiquate to it, or not: or whether they were not rather cal|culated to deceive and in&s;nare the people to whom they were made.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="016183_0032_0F9BCC2C4FD2CBE8">
"THAT the &s;aid conte&s;t was occa&s;ioned, partly by the i&s;&s;uing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the re&s;pective government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the one part, and tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> on the other, antecedent to the late e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the ea&s;tern boundary of this &s;tate."</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this e&s;tabli&s;hment, which was in 1764, the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had granted but two &s;mall parcels of land in the new territory of <HI>Vermont,</HI> namely, the patent of <HI>Hoo&s;ick,</HI> in 1765, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to extend into the town&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> and to include five or &s;ix thou&s;and acres of land in &s;aid town, which is &s;ituate in the &s;outhwe&s;t corner of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont:</HI> and al&s;o the patent of <HI>Wallum&s;cock,</HI> in 1739, is &s;aid to interfere with the town&s;hips of <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Bennington;</HI> includ|ing about five thou&s;and acres of land: the&s;e are all the <HI>New-York</HI> patents which interfered with the li|mits of <HI>Vermont,</HI> at the time of the &s;ettlement of their ea&s;tern boundary,; "and partly by a num|ber of grants made under the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;aid ea&s;tern boundary, which had been granted by the govern|ments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> re|&s;pectively, or one of them; in which the la&s;t men|tioned grants by the late government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the intere&s;t of the &s;ervants of the crown, and of new adventures, was, in many in&s;tances, contrary to ju&s;|tice and policy, preferred to the equitable claims for confirmation of tho&s;e who had patented the lands under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI>"</P>
<P>THIS confe&s;&s;ion comes very near the truth, tho' in the &s;entence <Q>was, in many in&s;tances, contrary

<P>THE government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> previous to the &s;ettlement of the &s;aid boundary line, (and when tho&s;e lands were univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed to be in that government) had granted one hundred and thirty-&s;ix town&s;hips, &s;ix miles &s;quare, in the territory of the now &s;tate of <HI>Vermont.</HI> Previous to the&s;e grants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> the government of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> had granted &s;undry tracts of land in the territory afore&s;aid, which in the &s;ettlement of the boundary line between them and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, fell within the juri&s;diction of the latter, and was by them mo&s;tly confirmed to the original grantees under <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI> No &s;ooner had the government of <HI>New-York</HI> obtained juri&s;diction of the &s;aid territory, but they proceeded to re-grant the lands afore&s;aid to new adventurers, in prejudice to the grantees and actual &s;ettlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay:</HI> But remon&s;trances from them again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> as mentioned afore&s;aid, procured the king's prohibition, which is as follows.</P>

New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had for&s;aken and whol|ly neglected them, and <HI>New-York</HI> tyrannized over them as much as they po&s;&s;ibly could, (or dare) and they were a people between the heavens and the earth, as free as is po&s;&s;ible to conceive any people to be; and in this condition they formed government upon the true principles of liberty and natural right; nor can the government of <HI>NewYork</HI> acquire any right of juri&s;diction over them in con&s;equence of confederating with the other free &s;tates of <HI>Ame|rica;</HI> ina&s;much as the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> was at that time not only independent of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> but of any and every of the nuited &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE royal adjudication of the boundary line afore-mentioned, was temporary in its nature, and arbitrary in its extention and conveyed nothing of the nature of a charter, grant, or permanent juri&s;|diction
<PB N="48" REF="016183_0048_0F9BCC3B5803B868">to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but receiv|ed its life and &s;pirit by a mi&s;tical communication which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have every moment from the &s;overeign will of the royal adjudicator; from that &s;ource only this line crew all its &s;upport, as the branch does from the vine from whence it &s;prings; and the declaration of independence cut|ing the vital union, occa&s;ioned this line like a lamp to go out which exhau&s;ted of oil and leave no tra|ces of its exi&s;tence; from which moment the ima|ginary claim of the <HI>New-Yorki&s;h</HI> juri&s;diction over the territory of <HI>Vermont</HI> expired, and the inhabitants thereof reverted to a &s;tate of nature. Thus it ap|pears, that the government <HI>New-York</HI> 1&s;tly forfeit|ed their claim of juri&s;diction by the illegal mea&s;ures made u&s;e of in acquiring it. And 2dly, by the il|legal and oppre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e of it. And 3dly and la&s;t|ly, they have lo&s;t it by the annihilation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> king's authority in con&s;equence of the late revo|lution, by which means the &s;aid adjudicated op|pre&s;&s;ive juri&s;dictional line became null and void to all parties, and is as though it had not been.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, this frontier country was under the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity of forming government; the inhabitants were obliged to exerci&s;e not only an in|ternal policy among them&s;elves, but an external po|licy again&s;t foreign inva&s;ions; this they dare not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ru&s;t to the management of the government of <HI>New-York;</HI> who, we have but very little rea&s;on to doubt, would rejoice to have had the inhabitants cut off, that their lands might fall into their hands; an ob|ject which they have been un&s;ucce&s;&s;fully pur&s;uing for many years.</P>

THE government of the infant &s;tate was, as it were, in <HI>embryo,</HI> when the haughty general <HI>Eurgoyne</HI> was penetrating the country; his &s;pacious procla|mation filled the air with a tyrants awe; intimidated the weak, the &s;ervile and ba&s;e, but inraged the &s;trong, the generous and the brave. Mean while the coun|cil of the new &s;tate was very indefatigable in form|ing de&s;igns again&s;t him; not only by forming their own militia into regular battalions under brave of|ficers in order to oppo&s;e him, but by exciting the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: while the&s;e matters were tran&s;ecting, general <HI>Schuyler</HI> or|dered the militia of this &s;tate to march to <HI>Saratoga,</HI> but government would not permit it, ina&s;much as they apprehended that <HI>Bennington</HI> and its vicinity was an object of de&s;truction by the enemy. How|ever the brave general STARK with his detachment arrived at a lucky moment, and being chearfully joined by the green mountain boys, fell on the ene|my with relentle&s;s fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, which terminated in the two memorable and glorious battles of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and was the fir&s;t check to the progre&s;s of a formi|dable enemy; which proved the &s;alvation of the new &s;tate, and had its &s;alutary influence on the pending cau&s;e of the independent &s;tates of <HI>America</HI> at large, and is a &s;triking proof of the good policy of a&s;&s;uming government.</P>
<P>ANY one who is acquainted with mankind, and things, mu&s;t know that it would be impracticable to manage the political matters of this country without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of civil government. A large body of people de&s;titute of it, is like a &s;hip in the &s;ea without a helm or mariner, to&s;&s;ed with impetuous
<PB N="50" REF="016183_0050_0F9BCC3CD35CF478">waves. They could not enjoy dome&s;tic peace and &s;ecurity, con&s;idered ab&s;tractly, from a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> war and <HI>Yorki&s;h</HI> u&s;urpation, without civil regulations; the two la&s;t con&s;iderations do in the mo&s;t urgent manner excite them to &s;trengthen and confirm the government &s;et up by the con&s;ent, approbation and authority of the people, which is the fountain of all temporal power, and from which the citizens of <HI>Ver|mont</HI> have already experienced &s;uch &s;ignal advanta|ges. This puts them on an equal footing with their <HI>NewYork</HI> adver&s;aries, and will finally enable them to baffle all their machinations and devices which nothing el&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly do.</P>
<P>USURPATION and inju&s;tice was the primary cau&s;e of the &s;eparation and revolt of the <HI>Engli&s;h American</HI> colonies from <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and this was al&s;o their grand rea&s;on and ju&s;tification for &s;o doing; and con|&s;equently the ground of their right to independency. The&s;e rea&s;ons are abundently conclu&s;ive and &s;atis|factory, as exhibitted by congre&s;s at large; and there appears to be a great degree of &s;imilarity in this controver&s;y with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government with that of <HI>Vermont</HI> again&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> except in this re&s;pect, that the territory of <HI>Vermont</HI> was never under the juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York;</HI> although by fraud, inju&s;tice, and the conniv|ing of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> court, they procured a royal order, purporting &s;uch a claim; which, in reality, origi|nated from a complication of intere&s;ted and tyran|nical views, between them and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> court; the latter promoted and extended the power and influence of the former in <HI>America,</HI> to promote and aid in the &s;ubjugation of it; (for at that time the
<PB N="51" REF="016183_0051_0F9BCC3D906F65C0">projection was forming) and it is well known that <HI>New-York</HI> was their favorite government; and it hardly admits a di&s;pute but that the intrin&s;ic cau&s;e of the royal exten&s;ion of the juri&s;diction was to cor|roborate the de&s;igns which have &s;ince been attempt|ed again&s;t <HI>America;</HI> this and the <HI>Quebec</HI> bill was of a piece, and the motive of their extention the &s;ame, to more effectually bribe them governments to their intere&s;t, as &s;ub&s;equent and reciprocal tran&s;actions may more fully evince.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed with the parallel. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government claimed an exclu&s;ive right of taxing the colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; &s;uch a prerogative would unavoidably have terminated finally in abject &s;lavery, as has been fully illu&s;trated by many inge|nious writers, and verified by the univer&s;al experi|ence of mankind; but the government of <HI>New-York</HI> took a more direct and immediate method, for at one blow they &s;truck at the landed property of eve|ry of the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> by &s;tretching their &s;ub&s;equent interfering patents over them; this was more like a combination of land thieves, than a go|vernment who covering the lands and lobors of the inhabitans, which, but a little before by iniquitous concerted mea&s;ures at the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> court (in &s;tead of &s;laves) they proved to be denominated their &s;ub|jects. The mutilating the charter of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay</HI> by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, was a high hand|ed &s;tride of arbitrary power, and &s;truck the very nerves of liberty, but not &s;o fatal as though they had appropriated the &s;od of the colony to new ad|venturers, as in the in&s;tance of the interfering pa|tents before mentioned; for nothing which can be
<PB N="52" REF="016183_0052_0F9BCC3E50A09F50">done to any people is capable of &s;o effectually in|&s;laving them, as the monopoly of their lands; when this is the ca&s;e with a people, it is idle for them to di&s;pute any more about liberty; for a &s;overeign nod of their landlord, cannot fail to over awe them, and by degrees era&s;e the natural images of liberty from the mind, and make them grovel out a conteptable and mi&s;erable life.</P>
<P>THE dete&s;table acts of outlawry pa&s;&s;ed the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, by the legi&s;lative authority of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> particularly again&s;t the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont</HI> was, in &s;ub&s;tance, a po&s;itive declaration of war again&s;t them: by the&s;e acts they declared tho&s;e inhabitants out of their protection; and abdicated the government, provided they may be &s;uppo&s;ed at that time to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any right thereto. The fact is, they appealed to arms; in this ca&s;e they mu&s;t effect the conque&s;t of <HI>Vermont,</HI> or give up their pretentions to the government there|of. The inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> on the 26th day of <HI>April</HI> following, publi&s;hed a declaration of a de|fen&s;ive war again&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> as afore&s;aid, and warlike preparations were making on both &s;ides; but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> inva&s;ion has procra&s;|tinated the determination of the matter till this time; and when this great and a&s;toni&s;hing revolution &s;hall be fully &s;ettled, ratified, and confirmed, it will be early enough for <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Vermont</HI> to proceed to the &s;ettlement of their controver&s;y.</P>
<P>BUT to continue the parallel. Tho&s;e acts of out|lawry according to the expre&s;s tenor thereof, im|powered their courts of judicature, to award &s;en|tence of death again&s;t any of tho&s;e inhabitants as
<PB N="53" REF="016183_0053_0F9BCC3F11DB3A60">&s;hould be capitally indicted, although they were not per&s;onally before &s;uch court; and in like manner, any other &s;entence of puni&s;hment &s;hort of death, a|gain&s;t any of the &s;aid inhabitants which &s;hould be criminally indicted without any hearing, mearly on indictment it&s;elf; and al&s;o gave a full indemnifica|tion to any and every of their &s;ubjects, for killing, maiming or wounding, tho&s;e inhabitants which op|po&s;ed &s;uch execution of law: in fine, the real de|&s;igns of the&s;e laws were to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farms of tho&s;e inhabitants, or to make tho&s;e who had the magnanimity to oppo&s;e them outlaws, and kill them where ever they could be found, that they might po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy the country; for &s;uch as they could not kill on the &s;pot they only had to in|dict capitally, and procure a &s;entence of death a|gain&s;t them, from their court of judicature, (which was ea&s;ily done) and then every of their &s;ubjects or ruffians, became legal executioners; and from mo|tives of public or private rewards, were at liberty, nay, under obligations to kill and exterpate them from the lands coveted, in any manner, and by any &s;tratagem which might be&s;t &s;erve &s;uch inhumane purpo&s;&s;es; for all which &s;avage cruelties, the par|petrators had governmental indemnification; and thus the inhabitants (which they would fain have to be their &s;ubjects) were obliged either to give up their inheritance, or, in the <HI>Yorki&s;h</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word become outlaws, fellons, rioters, &amp;c. and be &s;ub|jected to the dangers and hazards of the &s;hocking evils before mentioned, which nothing but the dar|ing &s;pirit and unconquerable fortitude of the green mountain boys prevented taking place.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="016183_0054_0F9BCC3FD00EFE10">
MUCH more might be &s;aid as to the inju&s;tice, tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion, and malevolence of the&s;e laws, but it is needle&s;s to animadvert any further on them, ina&s;much as they carry their own refutation along with them; they are therefore &s;ubjoined verbatim to this vindication; with the original an&s;wer to the &s;ame, publi&s;hed &s;oon after they made their public appearance, and &s;ubmitted to the public con&s;idera|tion; with this ob&s;ervation, that among the arbi|trary edicts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government towards the colonies, none were equally oppre&s;&s;ive to this, ex|cept their declaration of war. Their act for tran&s;|porting the &s;ubjects of the colonies acro&s;s the &s;ea for trial for crimes committed or &s;aid to be com|mitted in this country, was a daring &s;troke again&s;t the liberties of a free people; for though they were permitted a per&s;onal hearing, yet it was attended with great embarra&s;&s;ments, and in&s;urmountable e|vils and di&s;advantages, to be forced to a trial in a &s;trange country, de&s;titute of acquaintance, friends, or evidence, to make a defence; and probably with|out money or credit; this would be a &s;hocking con|dition to be reduced to, e&s;pecially by law, the ori|ginal de&s;ign of which, was to protect and promote the liberty and happine&s;s of mankind. This bears a near re&s;emblance to tho&s;e acts of outlawry, tho' it is hardly &s;o replete with malicious turpitude; and therefore a more certain de&s;truction would have been the fate of the inhabitants of <HI>Vermont,</HI> had tho&s;e laws taken place; who, on a landjobbers indictment, and a landjobbing courts judgment, without hearing, to &s;uffer death, or other puni&s;hment, by virtue of the laws of an infamous landjobbing legi&s;lature.</P>

While we view the &s;pirit of the general a&s;|&s;embly in their re&s;olves, we cannot but reflect with &s;ome regret, on what may of con&s;equence prove the re&s;ult (without an alteration) of their pre&s;ent opini|on; but there are &s;carce any circum&s;tances that en|tirely exclude hope; therefore we are not yet in total de&s;pair; for this moment we happily call to mind, that the general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;ame pro|vince, about two years ago, did annex all that part of the <HI>Bay</HI> province we&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, to that UNLIMITED county of <HI>Albany;</HI> but their ava|ricious grappling not being of a &s;ufficient &s;trength for &s;uch an unrea&s;onable burthen, it failed, by which they lo&s;t their ideal booty.</P>
<P>THE reader will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, that in the re&s;olves of the a&s;&s;embly afore&s;aid, there is not a &s;in|gle word mentioned in regard to the title of the land conte&s;ted for, but that they level all their
<PB N="61" REF="016183_0061_0F9BCCD4569A7020">&s;pleen, and point all their malice at notorious riot|ers, as they call them, and make a pretended &s;hew and figure, as though they were great &s;ticklers for good order and government; although at the &s;ame time every per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e, who has had any acquaintance and knowledge of the controversy, ab&s;olutely knows, that out goodly and, with the la|bour thereon, is the only &s;ubject matter and grand object of the whole controver&s;y; and give the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> but that, and the matter would be accom|pli&s;hed to their eternal &s;atisfaction; and it is pre|&s;umed the words riotous di&s;orderly, licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grantees and pre&s;ent occupants, for the whole cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding century.</P>
<P>FOR the truth of the ca&s;e is, the executors of the law, are mo&s;t (if not all) of them the pretended claimants to the lands whereon the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grantees and occupants dwell; and their judgments on writs of ejectment, brought by the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, have not hitherto failed to corre&s;pond with their imaginary intere&s;ts; but were they hone&s;t men they would not undertake to be judges in their own ca&s;e, or in any other wherein the re&s;olution thereof would make a pre&s;ident for their own, e&s;pe|cially in title of land wherein judge and plaintiff are connected in one common intere&s;t: &s;uch a di&s;|tribution of law is contrary to the law of rea&s;on and nations.</P>
<P>THEREFORE our ca&s;e &s;tands thus, if we &s;ubmit to their execution of law, and become obedient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of their de&s;igning government, we mu&s;t &s;oon yield to be their tenants and &s;laves;

<P>HIS excellency governor <HI>Tryon</HI> in conformity to the addre&s;&s;es of the general a&s;&s;embly of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> having on the 9th day of <HI>March</HI> 1774, with the advice of his council, i&s;&s;ued his proclama|tion, offering therein large &s;ums of money for the purpo&s;e of apprehending and impri&s;oning the fol|lowing per&s;ons, viz. <HI>Ethan Allen, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Cochrain, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Breakenridge,</HI> and <HI>James Smith.</HI></P>
<P>ANA whereas his excellency the governor, by the &s;ame proclamation, hath &s;trictly enjoined and com|manded all magi&s;trates, ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;heriffs, and other civil officers of the counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> to be active and vigilent in apprehending and impri&s;oning the per&s;ons above-named; and we the afore&s;aid per&s;ons, who have hereunto &s;ub&s;crib|ed, being con&s;cious that our cau&s;e is good and equi|table in the &s;ight of GOD, and all unprejudiced and hone&s;t men, are determined at all events, to main|tain and defend the &s;ame 'till his maje&s;t's plea&s;ure &s;hall be known concerning the validity of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants.&mdash;And we now proclaim to the

It is well known by all wi&s;e and &s;en&s;i|ble per&s;ons in the neighbouring governments, (that have animadverted on the controver&s;y) that their pretended zeal for good order and government, is fallacious, and that they aim at the lands and la|bours of the grantees and &s;ettlers afore&s;aid; and
<PB N="81" REF="016183_0081_0F9BCCE4CEED22F0">that they &s;ubvert the good and whole&s;ome laws of the realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>AND, ina&s;much as the malignity of their di&s;po&s;i|tion towards us, hath flamed to an immea&s;urable and murtherous degree, they have in their new|fangled laws, calculated for the meridian of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants, pa&s;&s;ed the 9th of <HI>March,</HI> 1774; &s;o calculated them, as to corre&s;pond with the depra|vedne&s;s of their minds and morals; in them laws, they have exhibited their genuine pictures. The emblems of their in&s;atiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barbarous, and blood-guiltine&s;s of di&s;po|&s;ition and intention is therein portraited in that tran&s;parent image of them&s;elves, which cannot fail to be a blot and an infamous reproach to them, to po&s;terity.&mdash;We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that every of his maje&s;ty's council, or that all the mem|bers of the general a&s;&s;embly were active in pa&s;&s;ing &s;o bloody and uncon&s;titutional a &s;et of laws; undoubt|edly, &s;ome of them di&s;approved thereof; and it is altogether po&s;&s;ible, that many that were active in making the law, were impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e repre|&s;entations, and acted under mi&s;taken views of doing honor to government; but be this as it will, it ap|pears that there was a majority. and it has been too much the ca&s;e with the government, for a num|ber of de&s;igning &s;chemers, and land-jockeys, to rule the &s;ame. Let us take a view of their former nar|row and circumb&s;cribed boundaries, and how, that by legerdemain, bribery and deceptions of one &s;ort or other, they have extended their domain far and wide; they have wrangled with and encroached on
<PB N="82" REF="016183_0082_0F9BCCE74A7EAD10">their neighbouring governments, and have u&s;ed all manner of deceit and fraud to accompli&s;h their de|&s;igns: their tenants groan under their u&s;ury and oppre&s;&s;ion; and they have gained, as well as merit|ed di&s;approbation and abhorrence of their neigh|bours, and the innocent blood they have already &s;hed, calls for heaven's vengeance on their guilty heads; and if they &s;hould come forth in arms again&s;t us thou&s;ands of their injured and di&s;&s;atisfied neighbours in the &s;everal governments, will join with us, to cut off, and extirpated &s;uch an execrable race from the face of the earth!</P>
<P>THIS piece is not &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a full an|&s;wer to the new con&s;tructed laws afore&s;aid; for &s;uch a large <HI>two year old,</HI> hath never before been &s;een in <HI>America,</HI> it being of an enormous and mon&s;trous birth; nor is it &s;uppo&s;ed to give the legi&s;lators their full characters: but &s;o much may &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent. To quote the laws, and make remarks thereon, would be matter &s;ufficient for a volume: However, we will yet make &s;ome &s;hort ab&s;ervations,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, NEGATIVELY, it is not a law for the pro|vince of <HI>New-York</HI> in general, but,</P>
<P N="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a law but for part of the counties of <HI>Charlotte</HI> and <HI>Albany;</HI> viz. Such parts thereof as are covered with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> char|ters; and it is well known tho&s;e grants compo&s;e but a minor part of the inhabitants of the &s;aid province; and we have not pre&s;entative in that a&s;&s;embly. The fir&s;t knowledge we had of &s;aid laws, was the com|pletion of them; which informed us, that if we a&s;|&s;embled, three or more of us together, to oppo&s;e (that which they all legal) authority, we &s;hall be
<PB N="83" REF="016183_0083_0F9BCCE7D807B008">adjudged felons, and &s;uffer the pains of death; and that &s;ame fraternity of plotters knew, as well as we, and the generally of the people in the adjacent co|lonies, that they have for a number of years la&s;t pa&s;t, endeavored to exerci&s;e &s;uch a cour&s;e of what they call law, that had they not been oppo&s;ed by the peo|ple of the&s;e grants (called the MOB) in the executing the &s;ame, they would, before this time, have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that territory, for which the laws a|fore&s;aid are calculated. Therefore the ca&s;e &s;tands thus: If we oppo&s;e civil officers in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our farms, we are, by the&s;e laws, denominated fe|lons; or if we defend our neighbours who have been indicted rioters, only for defending our property; we are likewi&s;e adjudged felons. In fine, every op|po&s;ition to their monarchial government is deemed felony, and at the end of every &s;uch &s;entence, there is the word DEATH!

<P>AS the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> rely on their charters from that government as the pre|dicate and ground of their title to the property of the land in conte&s;t; &s;o, on the other hand, the claimants under
<PB N="91" REF="016183_0091_0F9BCCEDD817A9E0"><HI>New-York,</HI> predicate and ground their title to the &s;ame land on the validity of their patents from <HI>New-York:</HI> This brings the point in i&s;&s;ue between the re&s;pective claimants to this &s;ingle que&s;tion, namely, <HI>Which of the &s;aid governments conveyed the fee of the land in conte&s;t?</HI> For it is &s;elf-evident both could not. And up in exploring the controver&s;y, and ani|madverting on the merits of the different claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to &s;tand the te&s;t, and adjudged valid, it will of nece&s;&s;ity invali|date the other. In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject, and &s;earching into the merit of the re&s;pective claims, it is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pect into the validity of the grant from king CHARLES to the duke of YORK, from which foundation only, the government of <HI>New-York</HI> deduce their right of patenting the lands in conte&s;t; yet the matter of fact is, that neither the government of <HI>New-York</HI> as &s;uch, or any indi|vidual therein, has ever had any conveyance of any land from the duke of <HI>York,</HI> nor doth any landlord or per&s;on whatever, in the government hold the fee or property of their land, by virtue of any convey|ance from the duke of <HI>York;</HI> but they hold the fee of their lands on a very different footing, viz. by conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that king <HI>Charles</HI> gave to his brother <HI>James</HI> duke of <HI>York,</HI> the fee of the lands we&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the head of <HI>Delaware-Bay;</HI> and allowing the fee to be &s;till ve&s;ted in him, his heirs or a&s;&s;igns, upon this hypothe&s;is no per&s;on in the province of <HI>New-York</HI> hath the fee or property of the land they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, the fee remaining the property of the duke of <HI>York,</HI> his heirs or a&s;&s;igns. And further, upon the &s;ame
<PB N="92" REF="016183_0092_0F9BCCEE9064F5E0">principle, tho&s;e identical patents under the &s;eal of <HI>New-York,</HI> which were laid on the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants, are in their own nature, equally null and void, with all other conveyances of land in the &s;aid province which have been given by the crown, the fee thereof being ve&s;ted in the duke of <HI>York,</HI> &amp;c. So that the grantees under <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are both, upon this &s;tating of the ca&s;e, equally de&s;titute of the fee of the land conte&s;ted for: But, upon this &s;tating, the grantees under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> have the argument of &s;ettlement, and oc|cupation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, on their &s;ide; which is abundantly &s;ufficient to give the priority, and pre|ference of title to them; &s;o that neither the govern|ment of <HI>New-York</HI> or their patentees, gain any thing by building their title on the &s;aid grants to the duke of <HI>York;</HI> for if there be any thing in it, it de|feats their own title as well as that of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> proving too much for their purpo&s;e, or no|thing at all. But, if the lands contained in the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant reverted back to the crown, then the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s patent became extinct, null, and ab&s;olutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the &s;aid rever&s;ion happened in con&s;equence of the &s;aid duke's abdicating the throne&mdash;turning papi&s;t, or by any formal &s;urrendery, or by any means whatever, provided the fee became reve&s;ted in the crown, then the &s;aid charter became extinct, as afore&s;aid; &s;o that whether the fee of the land in di&s;pute &s;till remains in the &s;aid duke of <HI>York,</HI> his heirs or a&s;&s;igns, or reverted, or was &s;urrendered to the crown, none of all this will in the lea&s;t ju&s;tify the government of <HI>New-York</HI> or its patentees, in
<PB N="93" REF="016183_0093_0F9BCCF0EED63FE8">founding their preten&s;ions of title to the lands afore|&s;aid, by virtue of the afore&s;aid grant from king <HI>Charles</HI> to the duke of <HI>York.</HI> For, take the argu|ment one way, and it overturns both the title of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> al&s;o, leaving the latter in occupation and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the di&s;puted premi&s;es, and that only, being intirely de&s;titute of the fee; and the <HI>New-York</HI> claimants de&s;titute of the lea&s;t colour of title what&s;oever. But, take the argument the other way, viz. Provided the fee of the lands afore&s;aid reverted and been reve&s;ted in the crown, then the &s;aid lands at the time of fir&s;t granting were crown lands the &s;ame as though the duke of <HI>York</HI> had never exi&s;ted. But the truth of the matter un|doubtedly is this, the under proprietors all except <HI>William Penn,</HI> who had the &s;everal countries par|celled out to them by the duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was contained in his grant; &s;urrendered their charters to the crown, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> became royal governments: This then being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the lands in di&s;pute became crown lands, and the governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as well as <HI>New-York</HI> crown officers, or king's agents, and it is of no con&s;equence to the king which of his governors grants his land, if &s;o be they be granted to and &s;ettled by loyal and indu&s;trious &s;ubjects, thereby adding to the revenue of the crown and en|larging and &s;trengthening the kingdom. This be|ing pre&s;uppo&s;ed, and admit for &s;uppo&s;ition only, that the governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> exceeded his proper limits in granting crown lands, mu&s;t the grantees who have &s;ettled tho&s;e lands, paid one of the crown officers for granting the &s;ame, and ex|pended their ALL, in &s;ettling and cultivating his
<PB N="94" REF="016183_0094_0F9BCCF18F58F480">maje&s;ty's wilderne&s;s land, and who are truly loyal &s;ubjects, be turned off the &s;aid land by thou&s;ands, and reduced to &s;tarving poverty, together with their numerous families, becau&s;e one of the crown officers either ignorantly or de&s;igningly impo&s;ed upon the people by granting crown lands over his bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more &s;o as it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ubjects are capable judges of the juri&s;diction of governments, and con&s;equent|ly there &s;hould be the greate&s;t care taken to guard the &s;ubject from injury in all ca&s;es of this nature; the truth of which will more fully appear by the following con&s;iderations, viz. That notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;uppo&s;ed error in granting the &s;aid lands, yet the great end of the crown in granting of it is compleatly an&s;wered; and provided the &s;ubjects i. e. the &s;ettlers are quieted in the fee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid lands, they will not be injured, &s;o that upon this hypothe&s;is, neither king nor &s;ubject would &s;u&s;tain damage: Indeed no per&s;on in the realm could have ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. True, the re|&s;pective governors of <HI>New-York</HI> may in&s;inuate, that upon this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> has cheated them out of their fees for granting the &s;aid lands&mdash;though it is evident, if crown officers are faithful to the king and &s;ubjects, they could take no more money for granting crown lands, than a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for their trou|ble, and the other governor's being &s;uppo&s;ed to grant the lands, &s;aves the &s;aid governor of <HI>New-York</HI> the trouble; &s;o that the argument is brought to this &s;ingle point only at la&s;t, that upon &s;uppo&s;ition the governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> exceeded his proper
<PB N="95" REF="016183_0095_0F9BCCF26234D9E8">limits in granting tho&s;e lands, yet neither king nor &s;ubjects are injured, (provided the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> hold the fee of the &s;aid land as a|bove) except the governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> and if they be &s;uppo&s;ed to be hone&s;t men, the trouble of grant|ing the land would be equal to their fees had they granted it; &s;o that they have not been injured a whit more in this ca&s;e, than they be &s;uppo&s;ed to have injured the &s;ubjects by taking exorbitant fees for granting the &s;ame lands; which to them is no injury at all, but a providential check to the exer|ci&s;e of their avarice. So that the re&s;pective gover|nors of <HI>New-York,</HI> in an equitable &s;en&s;e, are no loo&s;|ers in this affair; or at mo&s;t the privileges would be &s;o very incon&s;iderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, e&s;pecially when &s;et in competition with the &s;hocking and univer&s;al de&s;truction that would over&s;pread a large country of his maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects, provided they be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lands afore&s;aid.

<PB N="98" REF="016183_0098_0F9BCCF49650EFB8">extending their claim to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river.&mdash;There is another glaring and indi&s;putable evidence of the former we&s;tern extent of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> viz. Re|lative to &s;ort <HI>Dummer</HI> which was built by the <HI>Bay</HI> province in 1724, and garri&s;oned at their expence a great number of years; but upon its being excluded from their juri&s;diction by the &s;ettlement of the juri&s;|dictional line, between them and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, the <HI>Bay</HI> province repre&s;ented to the govern|ment at home, that the &s;aid di&s;trict of land and fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> having been determined to be the property of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> they were no longer obliged to garri&s;on and maintain it, and praying, that as it was nece&s;&s;ary to the defence of the country, that <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> might be directed to &s;upport it. In con|&s;equence of which, an order pa&s;&s;ed the king and council in 1744, that the governor and commander in chief of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;hould forthwith move the a&s;&s;embly, in his maje&s;ty's name, to make a pro|per provi&s;ion for that &s;ervice; and at the &s;ame time informing them that in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to comply with &s;o rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary a propo&s;al, his ma|je&s;ty would find him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;tor|ing that fort, with a proper di&s;trict of land contigu|ous thereto, to the province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> who cannot with ju&s;tice be required to main|tain a fort no longer within their boundary. In con&s;equence of this, <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> did maintain this fort, and paid a demand of arrears for its main|tainance, to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI> In the mean time <HI>New-York</HI> was never a competitor for the bur|then, willing as &s;he is to enjoy the advantage of granting and engro&s;&s;ing the &s;aid lands.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="016183_0099_0F9BCCF551AB77D0">
THIS being the ca&s;e, the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> by the royal decree, was obliged to main|tain fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> and it being on the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and on this very identical di&s;trict of land now in di&s;pute, can that government be ju&s;tly charged with granting lands in the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> when but a little before his maje&s;ty in council had adjudged the &s;ame lands to be in the &s;aid govern|ment of <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> and ordered them to de|fend it, as by maintaining fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> &amp;c. Sure|ly at that time <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> did extend its juri&s;|diction we&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; otherwi&s;e the king had ordered the government of <HI>New-York</HI> to have maintained fort <HI>Dummer.</HI> Nothing can be more flagrantly evident than, that the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had a right to grant crown lands where the crown compelled them to defend. From hence it appears, that the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had a legal right to grant the lands now in di&s;pute, and that, that government and his ma|je&s;ty's good &s;ubjects, the grantees of and &s;ettlers on the &s;aid lands, acted upon hone&s;t and honorable principles, in granting, purcha&s;ing &amp; &s;ettling the &s;ame, and on the other hand it appears, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> in re-granting the &s;ame land, acted quite the rever&s;e; and the more unpardonably &s;o, as they granted great part of it in open defiance to his ma|je&s;ty's authority manife&s;ted unto them by his ex|pre&s;s prohibition, dated the 24th day of <HI>July</HI> 1767.</P>
<P>FROM what has been already elucidated it appears, that the admini&s;tration of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had adjudg|ed in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the govern|ment of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> extended we&s;tward of <HI>Con|necticut</HI>-river,
<PB N="100" REF="016183_0100_0F9BCC5A427DB9D0">and that this was the general &s;en&s;e of the nation (till a&s;certained as afore&s;aid) is real mat|ter of fact.&mdash;True no determination of his maje&s;ty or reports of the lords of trade had before particu|larized how far the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;hould extend we&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river: but &s;uch determinations of their's mightily &s;trengthened the common opinion, nay, fully confirmed it, that that government extended we&s;tward to a twenty miles di&s;tance ea&s;t from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river. This was the o|pinion both of king and &s;ubjects at the time the go|vernment of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> granted tho&s;e lands; and adventurers could not conceive of any interme|diate boundary in one place more than another, be|tween <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river and the twenty mile limit a|fore&s;aid; nor had they any apprehen&s;ion that the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> would extend to the we&s;tward of that limit. This twenty mile line took univer&s;al and deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of geo|graphers, and was the under&s;tanding of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, and was thus portrayed in all former maps. The certainty of this general opinion may be fur|ther illu&s;trated from the con&s;ideration that none of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects applied to the government of <HI>New-York</HI> for grants of tho&s;e lands, till after the alteration of juri&s;diction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <HI>New-York</HI> &s;criblers, that their government extended patents from within the &s;aid twenty mile line acro&s;s the &s;ame, and on &s;ome part of the premi&s;|es in di&s;pute, many years before the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> granted tho&s;e lands&mdash;which will be hereafter con&s;idered: But, would further add, it is matter of di&s;pute whether the admini&s;tration at home
<PB N="101" REF="016183_0101_0F9BCC4509C3E890">would recognize tho&s;e patents granted by the go|vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the premi&s;es afore&s;aid; though antecedent to tho&s;e granted by <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> ina&s;much as the royal adjudication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the government of <HI>York York</HI> to grant them lands, which by royal ad|judication of the line of juri&s;diction between <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> fell within the go|vernment of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, as afore&s;aid. However, for argument only, we will &s;uppo&s;e the governments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>New York</HI> had each of them equal authority to grant tho&s;e lands&mdash;then on this &s;tating the ca&s;e, prior granting would of con&s;equence be priority of title. The fir&s;t con|veyance, upon this hypothe&s;is, being good and va|lid both in law and equity, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily defeat any &s;ub&s;equent grant from the crown or its repre&s;en|tatives, being as authentic, to all intents and pur|po&s;es, as any conveyance of the fee of land from the crown can po&s;&s;ibly be.&mdash;Thus it appears upon this mo&s;t favorable conce&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the argument preponderates in favor of the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as their grants are prior to tho&s;e of <HI>New-York,</HI> (except in the in&s;tances of the old parents, yet to be con&s;ider|ed.)</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the expre&s;s words of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants, that the grantees were not only entitled to the fee of the lands therein di&s;|cribed, but al&s;o to all the enfranchi&s;ements, and each and every of the privileges and immunities that by law his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in the province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> enjoy; &s;o that at the &s;ame time the gran|tees
<PB N="102" REF="016183_0102_0F9BCC451AA384E0">were ve&s;ted with the fee of the land, they were enfranchi&s;ed with, and entitled to all the privileges and immunities contained in their charters; as the holding of fairs, choo&s;ing town officers, and making and mending their own roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it &s;hould be the future plea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty, to continue the &s;aid lands in the juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> (which by the &s;ettlers afore&s;aid is hoped will not be the ca&s;e) that the claimants and &s;ettlers under the &s;aid grants, will neverthele&s;s have his maje&s;ty's gracious appro|bation to enjoy without let or mole&s;tation, the pri|vileges of incorporation therein contained; the gran|tees having ever con&s;idered tho&s;e privileges as in&s;e|perably connected with the grant of the fee-&s;imple.</P>

<P>FROM the facts and rea&s;ons that have been ad|vanced in the foregoing &s;ections, it manife&s;tly appears, that the title of the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> to the lands in que&s;tion is indefea&s;ible; yet &s;till there are &s;undry con&s;iderations that may &s;erve more abundantly to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h this title beyond he&s;itation. As,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, The far grea&s;t part of the extent of juri&s;diction of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and great part of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> depended entirely on his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, being wholly in the arbitration of the crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real grant on which the original circumference of the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> founded, ex|tended but &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea into the country,
<PB N="103" REF="016183_0103_0F9BCC45DACED6B8">to the we&s;tward, terminating about twenty miles ca&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river. This government was af|terwards enlarged by his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Benning Wentworth,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> governor of that province, directing it to extend to the we&s;tward until it &s;hould meet with his maje&s;ty's other governments. Which clau&s;e of we&s;tern extention in the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, as well as the royal adjudication of the boundary line between this government and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> in 1739, and report of the lords of trade in 1755, and many other arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing &s;ections, all on the part of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> amount to &s;ufficient evidence, that their go|vernment extended &s;o far we&s;t as twenty miles ea&s;t of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er. And with re&s;pect to the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> its original northen circumference ter|minated &s;outh of the city of <HI>Albany,</HI> and afterwards, as plantations are extended northerly, either on pa|tents procured immediately from the crown or go|vernment, or meer &s;ettlements on extra-provincial lands, commi&s;&s;ions from the king, to the re&s;pective governors were enlarged, as in the example follow|ing, viz. A. M. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> captain general, governor and commander in chief in and over the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> (then follows the enlargement,) and the terri|tories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e terri|tories are that exten&s;ion of juri&s;diction beyond their fir&s;t circum&s;cribed limits, terminating &s;outh of <HI>Alba|ny,</HI> called the province. This territorial exten&s;ion of juri&s;diction is altogether in the arbitration of the crown to curtail or extend as before repre&s;ented. This being the ca&s;e, the re&s;pective governors can no other way be judges of the extent of their juri&s;dicti|on,
<PB N="104" REF="016183_0104_0F9BCC469973B388">but by directions given them in their commi&s;|&s;ions, together with his maje&s;ty's expre&s;s proclama|tions, and public determinations relative thereto, as in the in&s;tance of the royal adjudication in 1764; a publication of which, by his maje&s;ty's order, gave his &s;ubjects to under&s;tand, that it was his plea&s;ure that the territorial juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;hould extend to the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which includes the di&s;puted premi&s;es within that govern|ment; before this it was impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ubjects to know it; if they could have under&s;tood it with|out his maje&s;ty's proclamation certifying the &s;ame, &s;uch proclamation would have been needle&s;s and impertinent. The truth of the matter is, his maje&s;ty in 1739, determined <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> government &s;hould cover the pre&s;ent di&s;puted premi&s;es; he alter|ed his determination in 1764, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> extended its territories over the &s;ame land. And the king has an undoubted right to alter and regulate the juri&s;diction of royal governments as may &s;eem to him mete, &s;o long as his royal power exi&s;ts; and for the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> to amu&s;e people of common &s;en&s;e, pretending that it is the ancient and indi&s;pu|table right of the colony of <HI>New-York</HI> to extend to the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, as its ea&s;tern boundary, is the very height of folly. It was in the nature of things ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible his ma|je&s;ty him&s;elf &s;hould have known that to have been the ca&s;e the moment before he determined it, and equally incon&s;i&s;tent that the &s;ubjects &s;hould know it before his maje&s;ty proclaimed it.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the repre&s;entation which was laid before his maje&s;ty by Lieutenant go|vernor
<PB N="105" REF="016183_0105_0F9BCC47638886F0"><HI>Colden,</HI> as an inducement to prefix the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, the ea&s;tern boundary of the province of <HI>New-York</HI>&mdash;That they were argu|ments of conveniency, holding up to view that it would be greatly to the advantage of the inhabitants on the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants, to be under the juri&s;|diction of <HI>New-York;</HI> which arguments are incom|patible with the idea of antecedent right of juri&s;dic|tion. Likewi&s;e, from hence we may &s;ee the incon|&s;i&s;tency of that government or its patentees, in founding their right in fee to the lands in conte&s;t, by virtue of the &s;aid royal adjudication of the boundary line on the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; ina&s;|much as it cannot operate to their advantage ante|cedent to the date of that adjudication, and after|ward cannot be con&s;idered any thing more than a mere line of juri&s;diction between the re&s;pective go|vernments.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be furthermore con&s;idered, that neither governments were ve&s;ted with the fee of tho&s;e lands; their ca&s;e in this re&s;pect, is quite the rever&s;e of that of proprietary governments, who have a right to appropriate the &s;oil. In royal governments, it is true, the governors have a delegated authority from his maje&s;ty to grant crown lands; and in &s;uch go|vernments it is a prerogative of the crown to alter the limits of juri&s;diction; his maje&s;ty hath a right to re-annex the di&s;puted premi&s;es to his province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> (in which it formerly was, and on the faith of which the claimants under that govern|ment purcha&s;ed and &s;ettled the &s;ame lands) or in|corporate it into a new government, or continue it under the pre&s;ent juri&s;diction, as his royal wi&s;dom
<PB N="106" REF="016183_0106_0F9BCC48107F2CD0">may di&s;cern to be be&s;t for the governed: But, upon &s;uch alterations of juri&s;diction, private pro|perty is never changed or &s;ubverted. For, if the property of the &s;ubject be in the arbitration of the crown, and liable to the &s;ame vici&s;&s;itudes and chan|ges with juri&s;diction, this would de&s;troy the very nature of property, and would render a king ab&s;o|lute, and de&s;potic, which is perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of the kingdom.&mdash;Therefore, to convey or alienate property, is the &s;acred prero|gative of the rightful OWNER.&mdash;Kings and gover|nors (in the kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) cannot in|termeddle therewith. There is indeed as much dif|ference betwen the change of juri&s;diction, and tran&s;|fering of the property of the &s;ubject, as there is be|tween light and darkne&s;s, although &s;ince the &s;aid royal adjudication in 1764, the <HI>New-Yorkers,</HI> have endeavored to blend them together to an&s;wer &s;ini&s;ter and lucrative purpo&s;es.&mdash;They were &s;en&s;ible, un|doubtedly, that &s;uch the afore&s;aid arguments were conclu&s;ive again&s;t their monopolizing the fee-&s;imple of &s;aid lands; and as it is very common for people, who are upon a de&s;ign of engro&s;&s;ing the property of their neighbour, to &s;et up &s;ome &s;pecious pretence of right, to vindicate them&s;elves from the imputation of di&s;honor and reproach; &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the <HI>New Yorkers</HI> endeavored to draw the curtain of the duke of <HI>York</HI> over their knavery, and under the feigned character of heirs, to that apo&s;tate duke, claim the lands afore&s;aid, and fancy them&s;elves the owners of towns, (fields) and hou&s;es that they build|ed not.</P>

<P>It appears from the &s;equel of the repre&s;entations, narratives and arguments contained in the <HI>New-York</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="016183_0109_0F9BCC4A500DE4D0">pamphlet, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> do not pretend to any conveyance of the fee of the lands in conte&s;t from the duke of <HI>York.</HI> But their grand hypothe&s;is is, that the juri&s;diction of their go|vernment from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, was predica|ted on, and bounded by the de&s;criptive limits of the &s;aid grant; and con&s;equently, that the di&s;puted Pre|mi&s;es was never in the government of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire;</HI> and, that that government never was ve&s;ted with authority to grant tho&s;e lands, and al&s;o con&s;e|quently, that the grants by them made, are in their own nature void. This is the &s;um of the <HI>New-York</HI> arguments relative to their title to tho&s;e lands. Here</P>
<P>FIRST, it is nece&s;&s;ary the de&s;criptive Limits of the above rehear&s;ed Charter be brought under Con&s;ider|ation; which includes the countries of <HI>St. Croix,</HI> adjoining <HI>New-Scotland, Pemaquid,</HI> the river <HI>Kene|beque,</HI> and the i&s;lands known by the names of <HI>Mar|tin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</HI> &amp;c. All the&s;e countries lying ea&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and within the actual juri&s;diction of the provinces of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. and at pre&s;ent not contended for on the Part of <HI>New-York.</HI> Their general a&s;&s;em|bly, in the "&s;tate of the right." &amp;c. had done well to have informed the public, whether their "anci|ent and indi&s;putable right" of juri&s;diction extended to every part of the de&s;criptive limits of the grants afore&s;aid, and if not, to which part it was circum|&s;cribed; and when done, and by what authority; whether their governors commi&s;&s;ions, at any time, particularized and determined to what part of the limits of the &s;aid duke's grant their juri&s;diction &s;hould extend, more than another, or to the whole;
<PB N="110" REF="016183_0110_0F9BCC4B10567AD8">or, whether any royal edict or proclamation, had ever thus given them &s;uch predicated limits of juri&s;|diction: this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them to do, in &s;upport of their title to the lands in que&s;tion. And furthermore, it is requi&s;ite for them to demon|&s;trate that tho&s;e lands were actually contained in &s;uch their former limits of juri&s;diction: but, if the government of <HI>New-York</HI> from royal determination, cannot extend juri&s;diction to any
one part of the de&s;criptive limits of the grant afore&s;aid, more than to another; then, on this hypothe&s;is, their juri&s;dicti|on includes the whole limits contained in the grant, or none at all; that it includes the whole, will not be pretended, and that any party, as predicated on them limits, cannot be made to appear: but on the contrary, it appears his maje&s;ty and council had no reference to any part of the limits of this grant, in determining the boundaries of the juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York</HI> in 1764, as may appear from the royal order it&s;elf, an extract of which is as follows: <Q>His maje&s;ty with the advice of his privy council, doth order and declare, That the we&s;t banks of the ri|ver <HI>Connecticut,</HI> from whence it enters the pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> as far north as the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary between the &s;aid two provinces</Q>&mdash;that parrallel of latitude is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed it's north boun|dary. The &s;ource of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omething to the northward of latitude forty-five, and comes much from the north-ea&s;t, a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance after it pa&s;&s;es that latitude; but it is notorious, that the &s;ource of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river is far &s;outh of it; &s;o that by comparing the de&s;criptive li|mits
<PB N="111" REF="016183_0111_0F9BCC4BCF535AE8">of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant, with tho&s;e expre&s;&s;|ed in the royal order, they will be found to be ma|terially different. The limit of that part of the duke's grant which re&s;pects the pre&s;ent arguments, is in the words following: <Q>Together al&s;o with the &s;aid river called <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river, and all the lands from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay;</Q> which limit in any po&s;&s;i|ble con&s;truction of it, can include but part of the di&s;puted premi&s;es, (which &s;aid premi&s;es extend and are bounded on the forty-fifth degree of north lati|tude,) as will more fully appear in a further di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of that line. But,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is manife&s;t that the king and privy council, in determining the extent of the juri&s;diction of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did not proceed upon the idea of that government's having any antecedent right of juri&s;diction to tho&s;e lands. Had that been the ca&s;e, the royal order had been predicated on the boundary lines of the duke's grant afare&s;aid, and could not have comprehended any more land than <Q>from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay;</Q> and the&s;e bounds are &s;o loo&s;e, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to found a line of juri&s;diction thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following ob|&s;ervations on the de&s;criptive limits thereof, which may be &s;een at large in the fore part of this &s;ection. Therefore, &s;uch part only as is nece&s;&s;ary for the con|&s;ideration of the indeterminate bounds before &s;poken of, is here quoted; which, after de&s;cribing the &s;itu|ation of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and that it abuts upon the main land <Q>between the two rivers there called or
<PB N="112" REF="016183_0112_0F9BCC4C96605908">known by the &s;everal names of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river,</Q> begins the de&s;cription under con|&s;ideration, <Q>together with the &s;aid river called <HI>Hud|&s;on</HI>'s river.</Q> Ob&s;erve, that as the de&s;cription of this river is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following di&s;criptions in &s;aid grant; nothing more can po&s;&s;ibly be included in it, but a di&s;cription of the river only, exclu&s;ive of one foot of land on either &s;ide. The &s;econd di&s;cription <Q>and all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay.</Q> The be&s;t ma|thematition on earth cannot a&s;certain the&s;e limits, except upon arbitrary principles, as there can be no prefixed place on <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river where to erect the fir&s;t bounds; and as to any particular place on the "ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay," where to erect a &s;e|cond, is altogether undetermined in this di&s;cription: But, ina&s;much as it includes all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, &amp;c. there is a little better foundation to e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t bounds than the &s;econd. It &s;eems in order to include all as afore|&s;aid, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to extend either to the head of the river, or to the mo&s;t northerly extention of the whole &s;tream, to make the fir&s;t bounds; and provided this imaginary bounds &s;hould extend north of the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, it would &s;o far exceed the &s;ettlement of the line in 1764. Be this as it will, the mo&s;t northerly part of the river, which would mo&s;t likely be the head, would be the mo&s;t favourable on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> for to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a fir&s;t bounds, and from thence to extend a &s;traight line to &s;ome place on the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Dela|ware</HI>-bay; this is &s;omething of a natural con&s;tructi|on,
<PB N="113" REF="016183_0113_0F9BCC4D596DA8A8">on the indeterminate de&s;criptive limits afore&s;aid, without exploring <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which in this ca&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary. And, fir&s;t, in tracing &s;aid river to its &s;ource, it is found towards it's extremity, to come much out of the north-ea&s;t. This being the ca&s;e, a &s;traight line from its head to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, would cro&s;s &s;aid river and include a large tract of land on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and perhaps cro&s;s the river &s;undry times; the con&s;equences may be drawn thus, that where the line may be &s;uppo&s;ed to cro&s;s the la&s;t time ought to be the fir&s;t real north boundary, of the "ancient and indi&s;putable" limit of juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York.</HI> For, if the bounds at the head of the river before &s;poken of, be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would include con&s;iderable land on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the ri|ver, within the old boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> which is contrary to any idea to be gained from the di&s;crip|tive limit afore&s;aid, viz. <Q>and all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, &amp;c.</Q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another pro|po&s;ed fir&s;t boundary better purporting with the de|&s;cription of <Q>and all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay,</Q> between the head of the river, and the place where the imaginary line was &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s? To this it may be an&s;wered, that a place between the&s;e two, &s;o far up the river as in tracing a &s;traight line from thence, to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, would not cro&s;s the river, may better agree with the above de&s;cription: Still, from none of the&s;e imagined lines, from the differ|ent imagined bounds, or from any other projected, po&s;&s;ible, fir&s;t bounds, can &s;uch a &s;traight line be a&s;|certained, till the place for the &s;outh-we&s;tern boun|dary
<PB N="114" REF="016183_0114_0F9BCC4E109BA1F8">on the "ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay" be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed? And the vaguene&s;s of the de&s;criptive limit is &s;o great, that it cannot be determined whether that bounds &s;hall be at the northern extremity of the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay, or at the &s;outhern, where it communicates with the main ocean, or at any other intermediate place between the&s;e two: &s;o, that from the uncertainty of the &s;econd bounds, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t, &s;o as exactly to include "all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of &s;aid bay," and no more. And,</P>
<P>THUS it is demon&s;trated from the vaguene&s;s, un|certainty and ob&s;oletene&s;s of the di&s;criptive limits of the grant to the duke of <HI>York,</HI> before quoted at large; that it is in the nature of things ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain it. From hence follows a &s;econd nece&s;&s;ary inference, viz. That it is equally impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory, that governmental ju|ri&s;diction &s;hould be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain juri&s;diction, in its own nature incapable to be determined, is in reali|ty none at all. And from hence follows a third inference which deter|mines the &s;equel of the argument on the &s;ubject of property, concerning the lands in que&s;tion, to be in favour of the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire:</HI> For, it is in the la&s;t place equally contradictory and im|po&s;&s;ible, as in the ca&s;e of the ab&s;urdity of a&s;certain|ing the limits of the pretended "ancient" juri&s;dic|tion of <HI>New-York,</HI> predicating it on vague and un|determinate boundaries, that, that government &s;hould predicate their right to the fee of lands, by them thus una&s;certainable; for as uncertainty and natural im|po&s;&s;ibility of a juri&s;diction's being rendered determi|nate
<PB N="115" REF="016183_0115_0F9BCC505B0DA8C0">makes it in reality to be none at all; &s;o the idea of property, predicated thereon is equally imperti|nent. True it is, by the royal determination in 1764, the ea&s;t line of <HI>New-York</HI> extended to the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river. Which may be foundation for conjecture, that that limit might have reference to a de&s;cription in the duke's grant afore&s;aid, "and all the lands from the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river," &amp;c. Yet when the repre&s;entation made by lieut. governor <HI>Colden,</HI> to his maje&s;ty in council, as men|tioned in this pamphlet, under the head of the nar|rative, &amp;c. comes to be con&s;idered, it will reflect light on this point. The arguments made u&s;e of in the &s;aid repre&s;entation were tho&s;e of conveniency and advantage to the &s;ettlers on tho&s;e lands to be in the government of <HI>New-York:</HI> and, that the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river was a good and certain boundary," &amp;c. The&s;e were undoubtedly the pre|ponderating motives of determining the we&s;t banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to be the ea&s;t boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> and &s;uch arguments are utterly incon&s;i&s;tant with the notion of an "ancient indi&s;putable right" of juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till another con&s;ideration which may be of moment in the ob&s;ervation of this, &s;o trumpt up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to the lands in conte&s;t: If it be admitted a line &s;hould be drawn from the mo&s;t northerly part of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to the mo&s;t north|ern extremity of <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay; &s;till, it is by no means probable &s;uch line would include more than one half (if &s;o much) of the lands in di&s;pute &s;o far as may be judged from the latitude and longitude of
<PB N="116" REF="016183_0116_0F9BCC511165B470">the re&s;pective objects: for con&s;idering the cour&s;e of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, which is nearly from north to &s;outh, except towards its extremity; and the &s;ea coa&s;t, from the river's mouth, together with <HI>Dela|ware</HI>-bay, forming al&s;o an indened line, to the &s;outh of we&s;t; the land included in the&s;e limits, by a line drawn from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay as a|fore&s;aid, would (excepting the &s;mall promontory formed by the mouth of the bay and the ocean) lye in the figure of an obtu&s;e angled triangle; and the cour&s;e of the &s;aid line from the river to the bay, ac|cording to occular &s;urvey, would be from the north|ea&s;t a &s;outhwe&s;terly direction: which very badly comports with the pre&s;ent north and we&s;terly exer|ci&s;e of juri&s;diction of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> at <HI>Crown-Point, Detroit,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;It may here well be ob&s;erved, the &s;ettlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;eem to be in a critical &s;ituation; every arbitrary mea&s;ure under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> is excerci&s;ed again&s;t them; and provided they flee to the ea&s;tward to procure inheritances, there they are fore-clo&s;ed, the de&s;criptive limits of the &s;aid ancient juri&s;diction covers them, (to wit) the coun|tries of <HI>St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Yet there is another large un|known country to the we&s;t and northwe&s;t, which has been but partly explored; and provided the&s;e people, in&s;tead of fleeing, to the ea&s;tward, &s;hould turn their cour&s;e to tho&s;e countries; there, it is in|di&s;putable but that <HI>New-York</HI> would encircle them with another odd de&s;cription of domain contained in their governor's commi&s;&s;ions, i. e. <Q><HI>A.

<P>FROM the foregoing de&s;criptions of the govern|ment of <HI>New-York,</HI> it appears they lay claim to &s;o exten&s;ive a domain three different ways, or have three different modes or modifications in comprehending and engro&s;&s;ing their progre&s;&s;ive limits. As,</P>

<P N="3">3dly. The limits of the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant, and ina&s;much as the grantees and &s;ettlers on the lands in di&s;pute, hold their title under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and that government had for &s;everal years exerci&s;ed their juri&s;diction over tho&s;e lands, even till 1764.&mdash;Therefore in this ca&s;e the government of <HI>New-York</HI> could not extend their territorial &s;ort of juri&s;diction over the premi&s;es; for &s;uch &s;ort of juri&s;diction might be challenged on the part of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> (if it &s;hould be admited at that time &s;aid premi&s;es were extra-provincial lands) and that with far the mo&s;t propriety. Ina&s;much as that government had grant|ed the land and began &s;ettlements thereon. Add to this the following clau&s;e in governor <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion, which they viewed to be of great weight in this ca&s;e, which, after de&s;cribing the former li|mits
<PB N="118" REF="016183_0118_0F9BCC528FB8E700">of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> <Q>and from thence extend|ing we&s;t till it meets with his maje&s;ty's other go|vernments.</Q> Add to this al&s;o, the rea&s;ons held forth in the chain of arguments, contained in the three fir&s;t &s;ections; all which were too potent for the <HI>New-York</HI> territorial &s;ort of dominion to fru&s;|trate. At that juncture, therefore, the lawyers, land-jobbers, politicians, &amp;c. planed out the afore|&s;aid three modes of juri&s;diction predicating it on the de&s;criptive limits of the grant to the duke of <HI>York.</HI> And on this new modled plan breathed an air of "ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT OF" juri&s;dic|tion, and con&s;equently to the fee of the lands in conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t intimation that ever &s;aluted the ears of the publick, a&s;&s;erting it to be the ancient right of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> to extend to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river as its ea&s;tern boundary, was di&s;coverd from a pro|clamation given under the hand of <HI>William Tryon,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> governor of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> &amp;c. and dated the 11th day of <HI>December,</HI> 1771. His proclamation begins after the following manner: <Q>Whereas it is the ancient and inconte&s;tble right of this colony to extend to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, as its ea&s;tern boundary.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was drawing a po&s;itive conclu&s;ion from fictitious, and till that time, unheard of premi&s;es; and rather influenced people in the &s;everal govern|ments, to purcha&s;e and &s;ettle under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> than di&s;wade therefrom; for common fame and com|mon &s;en&s;e, were a barrier again&s;t the belief of this <HI>New-York</HI> doctrine, which from the time of the roy|al adjudication in 1764, was by the proclamation
<PB N="119" REF="016183_0119_0F9BCC535157BA50">afore&s;aid, antidated to "ancient." That this doc|trine till then, was inconte&s;ted, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public con&s;ideration, and has ever &s;ince been conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>SHOULD this their new hypothe&s;is be admitted; yet, as hath been before ob&s;erved, the&s;e limits could include but part of &s;aid lands, according to the be&s;t judgment that can be formed without an actual and accurate &s;urvey of the de&s;criptive limits of &s;aid grant; which if the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can do and fairly demon&s;trate, to any able mathematicians, and com|petant and impartial judges, that they have rightly a&s;certained tho&s;e limits, it is engaged on the part of the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> that they &s;hall yield up to the land-jobbers of <HI>New-York,</HI> their lands and labours: an object which undoubtedly would be grateful and plea&s;ing to them; and which they have many years been in pur&s;uit of, and have hi|therto had the mortification to be baffled. It is ve|rily incumbant on the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in order to found title to tho&s;e land on this new &s;cheme.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, to a&s;certain the limits of their imagina|ry bounds. This the claimants under <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> will expect compleated, or hear no more of tho&s;e "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" boundaries of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>

<P>IN the next place it may be ob&s;erved, that in 1691 the privileges of incorporation were re&s;tored; tho' our authors, in their &s;tate &amp;c. endeavor to curtail the colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> by con&s;truing their la&s;t charter to extend no further we&s;t than the ea&s;t limit of the colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Their words are the&s;e, "the&s;e words <HI>(as far as)</HI> being in the ca&s;e of the grant of the crown on the &s;uit of the party, in legal con&s;truction, carry the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay colo|ny no farther we&s;tward than till it meets the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and much le&s;s to the we&s;tward of it."

<P>IT is to be further ob&s;erved, that however our authors may critici&s;e upon the gramatical or legal con&s;truction of &s;elected words or phra&s;es; yet, a lit|tle attention to the following real facts, will clearly point out the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch &s;ophi&s;ms.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, <HI>Connecticut</HI> charter, granted by king CHARLES the &s;econd, the 23d day of <HI>April</HI> 1662, was bounded and extended in length, by and with the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> fir&s;t charter, granted by king CHARLES the fir&s;t, the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1629, which inconte&s;tibly extended agreeable with the a|fore&s;aid di&s;criptive limits of the deed of &s;ale from the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to &s;ir <HI>Henry Ro&s;well,</HI> &s;ir <HI>John Young,</HI> &amp;c. and extended through the main land in longitude to the &s;outh &s;ea on the we&s;t part.</P>

This is the natural and legal &s;en&s;e of the pre|&s;ent charter of the colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay, predicated on undeniable facts.</P>

The de&s;crip|tive words, and the intention of the grant, will in legal con&s;truction be &s;atisfied by giving the colony the &s;ame length as the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay; and it is plain both from the recital and the &s;aving clau&s;e in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> patent, on which the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s title was founded, that the latter cou'd not in any &s;en&s;e, extend to the we&s;tward of <HI>Con|necticut</HI>-river.</Q> As this their a&s;&s;ertion is founded on the hipothe&s;is of <HI>Connecticut</HI> charter's being pre|dicated on that of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s, and therefore the arguments before exhibited on that head, are e|qually conclu&s;ive for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the we&s;tern ex|tent of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, but a recital of the di&s;criptive words of their charter, granted &s;ub&s;equent to their purcha&s;e from the council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> by king CHARLES the &s;econd, the 23d day of <HI>April,</HI> 1662, <Q>bounded on the ea&s;t by <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI>-river, commonly called <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI>-bay, where the &s;aid river falleth into the &s;ea; and on the north by the line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI> plantation; and on the &s;ea, and in longi|tude as the line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony, run|ning from ea&s;t to we&s;t: that is to &s;ay, from the &s;aid <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI>-bay on the ea&s;t, to the South &s;ea on the we&s;t part.</Q> Thus it appears and only by the demon&s;trations afore&s;aid, but from the expre&s;s words of the de&s;criptive limits of the charter it&s;elf,
<PB N="125" REF="016183_0125_0F9BCC57D53415D8">which cannot admit of a double meaning, (curious as our authors be in the art of playing with words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal mean|ing,) that it is the unque&s;tionable right of the colo|ny of <HI>Connecticut</HI> to extend its we&s;tern boundary to the South &s;ea on the "we&s;t part;" and in this that colony agree, who are now challenging their right in fee to tho&s;e limits, and actually making plantati|on, as at <HI>Su&s;quebannah,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

The following intelligence from our authors will intro|duce an an&s;wer to this query; who, after de&s;cribing &s;aid grant further inform, in page 3d of the &s;tate, &amp;c. That <Q>a fleet and land forces were &s;ent to re|move the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and put the duke in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q> Accordingly, on the 27th day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1664, the <HI>Dutch</HI> governor <HI>Stuyve&s;ant,</HI> &s;urrendered by capitula|tion, all the countries the <HI>Dutch</HI> then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to king CHARLES the &s;econd; when among other terms it was &s;tipulated, <Q>that all the people &s;hall remain free denizens, and &s;hall enjoy their lands, hou&s;es, and goods, where&s;oever they are within this country, and di&s;po&s;e of them as they plea&s;e.</Q> Thus, by conque&s;t, the king became reve&s;ted with his right to the lands conquer|ed: for, as the king had antecedently di&s;po&s;ed of the e&s;tate the crown was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the&s;e countries, to the colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay; therefore, his right now could not extend any further than the actual conque&s;t, which, in legal con&s;truction, mu&s;t

A further information is in page 4th, <Q>To remove any doubt of the validity of the dukes title, either from the want of &s;ei&s;in in the crown when it originated, or on account of the interme|diate conque&s;t by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was confirmed to his royal highne&s;s by further letters patent, dated the 29th day of <HI>June,</HI> 1674.</Q> That there was want of &s;ei&s;in in the crown at the time of fir&s;t grant|ing, is inconte&s;tible; for, as above &s;aid, the king by antecedent grants had dive&s;ted the crown of its right, and by this conque&s;t became reve&s;ted: So that from this, occa&s;ion will be taken to &s;ay, that in fact the province of <HI>New-York</HI> was originally &s;ounded on conque&s;t, and the limits of it, as before mentioned, circum&s;cribed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions pointed out in the terms of capitulation. Howe|ver unfavorable this conclu&s;ion may be thought on the part of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet, as the crown had prior to either of the duke's grants, di&s;po&s;ed of its right to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> colonies&mdash;if it was not thus founded on conque&s;t, it hath no foun|dation at all; and its having any place for exi&s;tence, is but an "intru&s;ion on the rights" of tho&s;e other colonies. Furthermore, it is my&s;terious and con|tradictory, admitting that that government was thus founded, to &s;uppo&s;e the duke could be lord pro|prietor; ina&s;much as by the conditions of capitula|tion, the fee then acquired to the crown, pa&s;&s;ed to the <HI>Dutch</HI> inhabitants, who then became <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects.</P>

THOUGH this tract of land now in conte&s;t, was contained in the original grant to the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yet as they never made any conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the crown on the &s;urren|der of that grant, the 7th day of <HI>June,</HI> 1635.

<P>THE government of <HI>New-York</HI> make the greate&s;t outcry again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter colonies, taxing them with intru&s;ion, violence and encroachment; and at the &s;ame time, are flagrantly more guilty of the &s;ame avaricious, unju&s;t, and ho&s;tile wickedne&s;s than all the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h America.</HI> Their capricious land jobbers have a &s;urpri&s;ing faculty in carrying their points; at the &s;ame time they are encroaching upon their neighbours, provided they meet with op|po&s;ition, they will cry out in the mo&s;t exagerating exclamations, violence, riot, trea&s;on, &amp;c. and at the &s;ame time, not he&s;itate to trample upon his maje&s;ty's authority, (the particulars of which may be &s;een in the proceeding narrative.) They are great advocates

Was it only that natural pre&s;umption being &s;o much in favor of tho&s;e inhabitants, it is humbly conceived, that all wi&s;e and unprejudiced per&s;ons will, at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend their judgments concerning them, till the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can clearly evince, that the&s;e people are in reality, without cau&s;e, tumultuous, di&s;orderly, &amp;c. And, ina&s;much as the facts of this controver&s;y is &s;o fully &s;et forth in this treati&s;e, the reader is thereto refer|red for a clearer exhibition.</P>
<P>OUR authors' in order to maintain their claim to the lands in conte&s;t, and if po&s;&s;ible, to include it within one of the de&s;criptive limits of the grant to duke of <HI>York,</HI> tell us many &s;trange things about the colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts:</HI> that <HI>Connecticut</HI> "in legal con&s;truction" &s;hould not have extended to the we&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river; and that their &s;ettlements we&s;t of that river were an in|tru&s;ion on the right of the colony of <HI>New-York;</HI> yet, neverthele&s;s for peace &s;ake, and rather than conte&s;t with "a powerful neighbour," they &s;ettled with

<P>THEY further inform, that <Q>the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> claim &s;tands by no means in &s;o re&s;pectable a light as that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI></Q> and in legal con&s;truction, &s;hould extend <Q>no further we&s;tward than till it meets the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Con|necticut</HI>-river, and much le&s;s to the we&s;tward of it.</Q> Our authors being men of great learning and &s;aga|city, &s;oon extended their ancient right of juri&s;diction over &s;uch part of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony as lay to the we&s;tward from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, and this their &s;cheme in &s;topping the we&s;tern exten&s;ion of that colony where it meets <HI>Connecticut,</HI> may be reckoned as one among the greate&s;t of their political atchieve|ments. "And it is worthy a remark," that had the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony extended we&s;t to the South &s;ea, it could not have met <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but mu&s;t have extended parallel with it, in the &s;ame direc|tion.</P>
<P>To give this plea&s;ing &s;cheme &s;ome kind of co|lour, they argue the nullity of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> fir&s;t charter, and introduce the duke of <HI>York</HI>'s grant as the olde&s;t title, page 5th, <Q>the <HI>Ma&s;&s;acht&s;etts</HI> char|ter was vacated, and the title of that colony now &s;olely depends on their charter of 1691.</Q></P>
<P>YET they allow, that that colony obtained the right of &s;oil from the council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that the charter of king <HI>Charles</HI> dated the 4th day of <HI>March</HI> 1628-9, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the charter &s;poken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of in 1684.</NOTE> ve&s;ted them with powers of go|vernment, (it's needle&s;s to animadvert on the&s;e
<PB N="135" REF="016183_0135_0F9BCC61916581A8">&s;trange accounts) however, after they have charmed their imaginations with the fruitle&s;s idea of extend|ing their ancient tight to all that part of the <HI>Bay</HI> province we&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, they complain bitterly of the encroachments of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> page 8th. <Q>Under circum&s;tances &s;o favorable to the rights of this colony, we have great rea&s;on to complain of the unwarrantable encroachments under the authority of the government of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay, by which a valuable tract extend|ing from <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river, within twenty miles of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river, has been wre&s;ted from us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEIR conduct &s;eems the more inexcu&s;able, as they mu&s;t have known that &s;uch encroachments were not only di&s;re&s;pectful to his maje&s;ty's autho|rity, and big with great mi&s;chiefs and di&s;orders, but were highly injurious to private property, great part of the&s;e lands having anciently been granted to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects under the great &s;eal of this colony.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to recite their old grants, which they tell us <Q>cover the country the whole breadth of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s claim:</Q> The manor of <HI>Ren|&s;elacrwyck,</HI> granted in 1685, and extending twenty-four miles each &s;ide from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river; and <HI>We&s;t|onhook,</HI> in 1705, which extends about thirty miles from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river; and <HI>Hoo&s;ick,</HI> in 1685, which extends about thirty miles from the river. It &s;eems to have been a political and univer&s;al principle with the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to begin their patents within the twenty mile line, and extend them ea&s;t|ward of it, that by this means they might have op|portunity to encroach on, and jockey their neigh|bouring
<PB N="136" REF="016183_0136_0F9BCC624FF12D40">colonies more or le&s;s, out of their lands, as &s;ub&s;equent policy, intriegue and power, would ren|practicable.</P>
<P>THAT government, thus extended their patent into <HI>Connecticut,</HI> one in particular, into the town&s;hip of <HI>Sali&s;bury;</HI> and it has ever been their practice to wrangle till they find by experience, that neither by &s;ophi&s;try, law, or ho&s;tility, they can maintain their exorbitant claims, and then capitulate on as good terms as they can; and conclude with branding their competitors with di&s;hone&s;ty, encroachment and many hard names, and don't &s;cruple to impeach their governmental authority, (as in the ca&s;e ju&s;t re|cited of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay) with being di&s;re&s;pect|ful to his maje&s;ty's authority, and guilty of great mi&s;chiefs and di&s;orders; although the authority of their own government, by their unju&s;t, avaricious encroachments on the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> even to <HI>Conuec|ticut</HI>-river, laid the foundation of tho&s;e di&s;orders, and they might have added blood-&s;hed; yet their a&s;&s;embly have the impudence to palm it all upon the authority of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI></P>
<P>THE claimants under <HI>NewHamp&s;hire</HI> are &s;o happy as to be almo&s;t exempted from any <HI>New-York</HI> claims, by patents from that government prior to their's; the afore&s;aid <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> patents being the only ones of this nature, the former includes a|bout one quarter of the town&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> on which part were about four &s;ettlers, when it was granted by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> This town&s;hip is bounded &s;oucherly by the north line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI>-bay, and extends we&s;t as far as the <HI>Connecti|cut</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colonies; the latter, i. e. <HI>Wal|lum&s;cock</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="016183_0137_0F9BCC646A2FED40">patent, was granted under the common &s;eal of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 15th day of <HI>June</HI> 1739. This patent is &s;aid to interfere with the town&s;hip of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and it is matter of di&s;pute, whether in its fir&s;t location, it included more than about thirty or forty acres within that town, tho' it &s;eems the patent by its de&s;criptive limits, extends further into the town, and the patentees produce a map corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e limits. This monu|ment is well known by the <HI>Bennington</HI> people, and is on the we&s;tern edge of the town; and there has never been a di&s;covery of any lines of the &s;urvey of that location to the ea&s;tward of this monument. The many circum&s;tances of this nature, amount to almo&s;t a certainty, that the patentees never made any actual location further interfering with <HI>Bennington,</HI> than as afore&s;aid; notwith&s;tanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one eighth part of the town; which lands are exceeding good in nature, and are &s;ettled wholly underthe <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> title, by indu&s;trious farmers, who form a wilderne&s;s &s;tate, have cultivated and brought the mo&s;t of it under good improvements, with many valuable hou&s;es, barns and orchards; &s;ome of them annually mowing at lea&s;t eighty tons of hay, and rai&s;e other produce of the country in proportion. Not the lea&s;t improvements of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions were ever made in that town, except by the&s;e inhabitants; neither had they the lea&s;t knowledge of a pretence of any <HI>New-York</HI> patents extending there till &s;everal years after they had &s;ettled the land. As has been before ob&s;erved, there were about four &s;ettlers on that part of <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> patent, included in
<PB N="138" REF="016183_0138_0F9BCC64922C5030">the town&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> when it was granted; and if the author has a right information, there has not been any more &s;ettlements made under the <HI>New-York</HI> title &s;ince, though there had &s;undry families &s;ettled on the premi&s;es included as afore&s;aid, under the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> title.</P>
<P>As the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of &s;uch part of the town&s;hips afore&s;aid as are included in the old patents, are materially different in many re&s;pects, from the circum&s;tances of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants in general; it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary that this matter have a particular con&s;ideration; and that none of the afore&s;aid arguments be con&s;idered in this ca&s;e but what are truely applicable; and in this review of the ca&s;e, it will be admitted, that the old <HI>Wal|lum&s;cock</HI> patent includes &s;uch part of <HI>Bennington</HI> as the plan the patentees exhibit doth contain.</P>
<P>IT is taken for granted that the royal determina|tion of the boundary line in 1764 could not extend the government of <HI>New-York</HI> antecedent to the date of that order, which was a manife&s;tation of royal power, and which was the &s;ole cau&s;e of that extenti|on; therefore, at the time the government of <HI>New-York</HI> granted the forementioned old patents, they could have no greater authority for &s;o doing than what they were then in fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: It remains therefore to be con&s;idered, whether the patents from the government of <HI>New-York</HI> are valid or not, &s;o far as they interfere with the town&s;hips of <HI>Benning|ton</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And fir&s;tly, it has been proved that the province of <HI>New-York</HI> as de&s;cribed in their governor's commi&s;&s;ions, doth not extend &s;o far north as the city of <HI>Albany;</HI> therefore the northern
<PB N="139" REF="016183_0139_0F9BCC65504709B8">tracts of country which the&s;e patents of <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> cover, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as belonging to their &s;econd &s;ort of domain, (to wit) the territo|ries. It has al&s;o been &s;hewn, that the&s;e territories are not circum&s;cribed to any particular limity, but that they were originally meant to include &s;ome an|cient grants that were independent of the province and adjoining &s;ettlements, on extra-provincial lands: probably that government may have authority to grant land to the we&s;t and north-we&s;t, where it is indi&s;putably unappropriated, and where the claim of none other government could interfere: but it will be in&s;i&s;ted upon, on the part of the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> &s;ettlers, which are included in the afore&s;aid old patents, that the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had no right to extend any of their patents to the ca&s;tward of a line equivalent to that which con&s;ticutes the bounds between <HI>New-York</HI> and the colony of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> This limit was ever thought by the people in general of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> as well as tho&s;e of the adjacent colonies, to be the ea&s;tern boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> until the aera of the late determination, which extended it to the river <HI>Connecticut:</HI> and labouring men that &s;up|port the world of mankind, are obliged to form their judgments of the juri&s;diction of governments by the common received opinions of mankind they are conver&s;ant with; and even admitting they make an erroneous judgment, yet, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as the lands were of but little value, exclu&s;ive of their toil and cultivation; and as the farmers in reality uphold the &s;tate, it is therefore not only incumbent on the laws, but on the policy of the &s;tate to defend them
<PB N="140" REF="016183_0140_0F9BCC661F567218">in ca&s;es of this nature&mdash;it mu&s;t be admitted that where the limits of governments are clearly a&s;cer|tained and notoriou&s;ly known, that a farmer tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ing in this manner on another's property, mu&s;t bear the lo&s;s. But, provided a country of people be generally under a deception as to matters of ju|ri&s;diction, and purcha&s;e land and make great im|provements, and all on a mi&s;taken footing; men in &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;hould be con&s;idered in the mo&s;t favorable light. For, as not only individuals, but the country about them were in the &s;ame manner deceived, and therefore, at the time of purcha&s;ing and &s;ettlement, they were utterly de&s;titute of the means of knowledge; yet, however, it is not con|ceded to, that tho&s;e farmers on who&s;e account the pre&s;ent arguments are exhibitted, are under a de|ception about this matter; for of all &s;orts of govern|mental juri&s;diction, the <HI>New-York</HI> territorial was the weake&s;t, loo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t vague; it was rather oc|ca&s;ional and political, than po&s;itive; and in its own nature almo&s;t or quite incapable of being extended fa&s;ter than &s;ettlements were actually carried on, or at mo&s;t the lands expo&s;ed to this territorial juri&s;dic|tion, &s;hould not be patented fa&s;ter than his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects are di&s;po&s;ed forthwith to &s;ettle. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity of granting &s;o fa&s;t may be pleaded on account of order&mdash;the policy of government may demand it; otherwi&s;e an occa&s;ional juri&s;diction would be al|together unable to abilitate the government to make conveyance of the right in fee; although it is indi&s;|putable that &s;uch a jurisdiction in matters of meer government, is to all intents and purpo&s;es, equal to po&s;itive juri&s;diction; but with re&s;pect to having a
<PB N="141" REF="016183_0141_0F9BCC66CECF2340">power to convey the fee of lands, is matter of doubt: But thus much with propriety may be inferred, that a title &s;o weak and impotent &s;hould not claim &s;u|periority over the lea&s;t conception of title whate|ver; a meer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is of it&s;elf abundantly &s;uffi|cient to maintain the right in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and on a judicious trial at common law, (could &s;uch an one be had) would be adjudged paramount to it.</P>
<P>THERE is another con&s;ideration that mu&s;t totally extingui&s;h and obliterate all po&s;&s;ible remaining idea of right, that the patentees of <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;aid tract of land included in the limits of the town&s;hip of <HI>Bennington.</HI> Only ad|vert to the date of that patent, which is on the 51th day of <HI>June</HI> 1739, and compare it with the time of the commencement of the &s;ettlement of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which was in the &s;pring of the year 1760, and there will be found to be twenty-one years from the date of this patent, to the beginning of the &s;ettlement under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI>&mdash;in all this time there was not the lea&s;t &s;ettlement or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion made in the pre|mi&s;es; although the expre&s;s condition of the patent was, that it &s;hould be &s;ettled in three years from the time of granting. Po&s;&s;ibly in all that time the pa|tentees might have got &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> tenants on &s;ome we&s;tern part of the patent, which, with the govern|ment of <HI>New-York,</HI> may be denominated a fulfil|ment of the condition of &s;ettlement; many large tracts having been patented, &s;ome &s;ince and others longer ago than <HI>Wallum&s;cock,</HI> which are yet mo&s;tly a howling wilderne&s;s. This practice of the govern|ment of <HI>New-York</HI> in extending their patents to the ea&s;tward of a twenty mile line from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river,
<PB N="142" REF="016183_0142_0F9BCC6793396300">hath ever been con&s;idered as a di&s;ingenious and de|signing policy in that government; thereby to lay a foundation for intruding on the rights of their neighbouring colonies; and has been attended with many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, as has been before ob&s;erved. And as that government have given up their exorbitant claims where they interfered with the right of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> it would undoubtedly be their wi&s;e&s;t way to do the &s;ame with re&s;pect to &s;uch claims as interfere with the right granted un|der the great &s;eal of the province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> and in&s;tead of treating the people that have &s;ettled tho&s;e lands under that title, as rioters and felons; to exerci&s;e that ju&s;tice and humanity towards them, which becometh governors to the governed.</P>
<P>IT remains &s;till, that there be a &s;ummary view exhibitted, relative to the rule of right which &s;hould take place with re&s;pect to the &s;ettlers under each government, that are &s;ettled on &s;uch part of the fore|mentioned patents as are included in the town&s;hips of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And although &s;uperio|rity of title is in favor of tho&s;e under <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire;</HI> neverthele&s;s, as the line of juri&s;diction in tho&s;e times of granting and &s;ettlement, was not expres&s;ly a&s;certained or known. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it would not only be bad &s;tate-policy, but great in|humanity and inju&s;tice to the &s;ubject; for either the government of <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s them, ina&s;much as both challenge a legal right; therefore, either title &s;ealed and confirmed with the &s;weat and toil of the farmer is abundantly paramount to the other.</P>

<P>As this repre&s;entation in all and every part is en|tirely groundle&s;s, and no pretence of proof to &s;up|port it, but is the meer calumnious a&s;per&s;ion of tho&s;e who have an implacable haired to the <HI>Bennington</HI> people, a po&s;itive denial of the facts alledged would be &s;ufficient refutation of tho&s;e facts. Neverthele&s;s as the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> have made a principal engine of this infamous &s;tory of their own creation, to de&s;troy the good character of the people afore|&s;aid, by repre&s;enting them to the government at home as the vile&s;t of in&s;urgents and out-laws&mdash;and ina&s;much as the facts alledged are capable of di&s;|proof by mathematical certainly, and &s;undry demon|&s;trations
<PB N="145" REF="016183_0145_0F9BCCB95350A038">of this &s;ort having been actually made, (though not with a view of di&s;proving this calum|ny, as it had not then been publi&s;hed,) by admen|&s;urations of the di&s;tance from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river, to the we&s;terly line of <HI>Bennington,</HI> all which agree that it is at lea&s;t twenty miles. Mr. <HI>Samuel Robin&s;on</HI> for once made an actual men&s;uration of that di&s;tance, and found it to be twenty miles and thirty-five chains; his affidavit and Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Wood</HI>'s toge|ther with an atte&s;ted copy of the &s;urvey of that town by Mr. <HI>Matthew Cle&s;&s;on,</HI> the &s;urveyor, is thought expedient to tran&s;cribe in its following order, which will abundantly &s;erve to exculpate the people of <HI>Bennington</HI> from that odium wherewith they have been branded. The author is furthermore e&s;peci|ally directed by the inhabitants of that town, to <Q>re|que&s;t the government of <HI>New-York</HI> to vindicate what their a&s;&s;embly have before alledged, by an|other accurate men&s;uration of the di&s;tance from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river, to the we&s;terly line of <HI>Bennington;</HI> and further notify that a&s;&s;embly, that as omnipo|tent as they may conceive them&s;elves to be, they mu&s;t neverthele&s;s recede from the calumny where|with they have abu&s;ed the inhabitants of that town, or continue under the relentment of tho&s;e inhabitants:</Q> Which take an additional affront at the ill u&s;age, ina&s;much as our opponents tell us page 3d, it is to <Q>be tran&s;mitted for the informa|tion of the government at home;</Q> and further in|form that it was to guard again&s;t the impo&s;itions which from the want of candor, they were appre|hen&s;ive the &s;aid &s;ettlers, who "&s;pared no art or act of violence," would by their agents deceive the go|vernment

They &s;till proceed upon this their favorite topic, and draw particular inferences from it to their advantage, <Q>for by chang|ing the &s;ituation</Q> of <HI>Bennington,</HI> <Q>it is made to comprehend a large part of <HI>Wallum&s;cock,</HI> which was granted under the &s;eal of this province &s;o
<PB N="147" REF="016183_0147_0F9BCCBAD87CAD40">early as the year 1739.</Q> This their &s;candalous a&s;&s;ertion is twice repeated in page 8th. One of the pa&s;&s;ages is as follows: <Q>Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll,</HI> one of the mo&s;t eminent coun&s;el of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Syl|ve&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Albany,</HI> were concerned for the defend|ants.</Q> When the&s;e gentlemen found <HI>Breakenridge</HI>'s farm to be within &s;eventeen miles of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river, and greatly to the we&s;tward of what the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had admitted to be the juri&s;dicti|on of <HI>New-York</HI>&mdash;they told him that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;et up any principle for his defence.

<P>THIS is far from being the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR authors in the twenty-&s;eventh and fini&s;hing page of their narrative, di&s;cover great invention and &s;ubtilty, who after giving an account of the unfortu|nate circum&s;tances of the town of <HI>Hin&s;dale</HI> which has, &s;ay they, "been taken up by a royal mandamus." This town&s;hip had fir&s;t been granted by the govern|ment of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay, and upon the &s;ettle|ment of the boundary line between the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in 1739, it fell within the lat|ter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the inhabitants and proprietors, who in addition to their title, had al&s;o the <HI>Indian</HI> right. This town&s;hip, by the determination of the boundary line between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> fell within the ju|ri&s;diction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <HI>Howard,</HI> after it had been &s;ettled about &s;e|venty years. The a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> in order to &s;creen their government from the imputation of the blame ju&s;tly due to &s;o reprehen&s;ible a conduct, endeavor to palm it on the government at home, &s;ee page &s;ixth, with re&s;pect to <Q><HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> a town&s;hip in the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> county. Even this is not to be a&s;cribed to our government, it proceeded from a much greater, and the highe&s;t authority. A mandamus was produced from the crown, on the report of the board of trade, and
<PB N="153" REF="016183_0153_0F9BCCC0DF51D668">by the advice of the privy council, which ve&s;ted the grantee with a right of election, an act deci|&s;ive in it&s;elf, and &s;uperceding the agency of the governor and council here, and the u&s;ual forms.</Q> A very extraordinary repre&s;entation! The nature of a royal mandamus is diametrically oppo&s;ite to this interpretation. The right of election in the grantees, is re&s;tricted entirely to crown lands which are unappropriated; in &s;uch lands, the grantee has a right of election, and common &s;en&s;e may teach, that neither a mandamus or any other crown grant can&s;ubvert the property which the &s;ubject holds un|der the crown by prior grants; and though there be ever &s;o many alterations in the juri&s;diction, &s;undry of which have perplexed the town of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> yet this &s;hould have no effect on the property of the &s;ubjects.&mdash;The&s;e grantees are likewi&s;e withheld from interfering on the right of the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ubjects.&mdash;Yet, it &s;eems Col. <HI>Howard</HI> had the vanity to locate his mandamus on the old plantation of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> which was fir&s;tly appropriated by a purcha&s;e from the <HI>Indians;</HI> &s;econdly, by a grant from the govern|ment of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-bay, and thirdly, by the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and fourthly, by an uninterupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and occupancy about &s;even|ty years.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubterfuge the gentlemen make u&s;e of to rid their government from di&s;honor, in making this la&s;t grant of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> is very extraordinary; it &s;eems not well calculated "to be tran&s;mitted for the in|formation of the government at home!" who are undoubtedly competent judges of their own man|damus's, and no doubt will ea&s;ily di&s;cern their la&s;t
<PB N="154" REF="016183_0154_0F9BCCC19B89AAD8">error to be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. Such prepo&s;terous granting of lands, is criminally injurious to the &s;ubject, as it never fails to embarra&s;s the different claimants with many concomitant difficulties. Yet, &s;till to ca&s;t the blame due to their government, on the king's mandamus, is more daringly injurious to the highe&s;t authority in the nation.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the maner of redre&s;s pre&s;crided for the &s;ufferers, viz. the old proprietors of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;hocking piece of contrivance, page 27, <Q><HI>Hin&s;|dale,</HI> a &s;mall town&s;hip which has lately been taken up by virtue of a royal mandamus, is alone un|fortunate&mdash;but even here the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors may be relieved, by a &s;uitable compen&s;ation, equal to the value of their improvements in crown lands, free from the expence of fees.</Q> The&s;e gentlemen in their great clemency have al&s;o conceded that the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;ettlers in general may be thus con&s;ider|ed, <Q>on the &s;ame terms, may be a&s;&s;igned to each of tho&s;e who are &s;eated on the &s;oil, actually appro|priated to others by the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of which cannot for that rea&s;on be confirmed; &s;uch a proportion of crown lands as the governor and council &s;hall judge to be ade|quate to their re&s;pective improvements.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to de&s;cribe the tract, <Q>a fer|tile and exten&s;ive country, in the northern part of the county of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and between <HI>Connecticut</HI>-river and lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> &s;till remains unpatented by their government, and might be planted and cultivated by the&s;e people:</Q>&mdash;What a &s;urpri&s;ing conde&s;cention this! the po&s;terity of the original proprietors of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> e&s;pecially, to be allowed the
<PB N="155" REF="016183_0155_0F9BCCC253EBEE08">privilege to pull up &s;takes, quit their farms and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, hou&s;es, orchards, &amp;c. and join company with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;ettlers in general, and trudge off to the north-ea&s;t part of the wilderne&s;s of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and there commence another &s;ettlement, leaving their plea&s;ant habitations, fields, tenements, and country, in exchange for a howling wilderne&s;s; a pretty exchange!&mdash;and this to gratify a number of <HI>New-York</HI> cormorants. But, let's &s;top a little and con&s;ider&mdash;whether it would not be more righ|teous to change the &s;cene, and &s;o the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees remove their patents, that interfere with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> grants, and lay them in &s;he wil|derne&s;s of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> as neither government have ap|propriated it.</P>
<P>A &s;ufficient rea&s;on to be offered in &s;avor of the latter of the&s;e projects, is, that the &s;ettlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are in deed, and in truth the lawful owners and proprietors of the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demon&s;trated in the preceding &s;ections. Although the&s;e gentlemen have in the cour&s;e of their narration, flung out very ex|traordinary hims of rewarding his maje&s;ty's &s;oldiery, by the di&s;tribution of tho&s;e lands, yet they may here again be reminded, (which may further &s;erve as the above rea&s;on) that his maje&s;ty's proclama|tion directed the &s;oldiery to make their pitches on unappropriated and vacant lands, this therefore they mu&s;t do, at the hazard of lo&s;ing their grants or re|pitching. For tho&s;e lands which being antecedent|ly granted by the crown, by the agency of the go|vernor and council of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> mu&s;t forever exclude the &s;oldiery from pitching thereon; and

<P>OUR authors have given a tedious hi&s;tory of the &s;uits at law, which have been commenced by the <HI>New-York</HI> patentees, again&s;t the claimants and oc|cupants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and have exhibited many &s;pecious appearances of fairne&s;s, equity, and impartiality in their trials.

This narrative is in it&s;elf incredible, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that men who were convinced, they had had an impartial trial at law, and of the in&s;uf|ficiency of their own title, and the authenticity of that of their opponants, would raily to arm, in defi|ance of legal authority, and in defence of their own invalid title; e&s;pecially, after they had publicly de|clared

And the <HI>New-York</HI> attor|nies who compiled the <HI>New-York</HI> &s;tatings, and are al&s;o patented under that government, well knew that every action brought again&s;t the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> claimants has been de&s;ignedly laid below that &s;um.

<P>WITH regard to tho&s;e town&s;hips which fall within the la&s;t mentioned de&s;cription, we &s;ubmit to your lord&s;hips our opinion, that provided &s;uch town&s;hips do not include lands within the limits of &s;ome antecedent grant, upon which actual improvement has at any time been made, it would be advi&s;eable they &s;hould be confirmed as town|&s;hips, according to the limits expre&s;&s;ed in the grants there|of; and that all per&s;ons having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any &s;hares in the &s;aid town&s;hips, either as original grantees, or by pur|cha&s;e or conveyance, and upon which &s;hares any actual improvement or &s;ettlement has been made, ought not in ju&s;tice to have been, or to be in future, di&s;turbed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch &s;hares; nor ought they to be bound to any other conditions, whether of quit rent or otherwi&s;e, than what is contained in the grant.</P>

<P>THESE inducements are indi&s;putably authoritative, and need no commentation: Yet notwith&s;tanding the priority and preferance of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> title to that of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the &s;o many corroberating and concomitant in|ducements to the claimants under the former, to &s;ettle and cultivate tho&s;e lands; yet the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York,</HI> in &s;un|dry parts of their &s;tate of the right, &amp;c. and more particular|ly through the appendix, treat tho&s;e inhabitants, merely on account of &s;uch &s;ettlement, with the mo&s;t extreme injury; who, in&s;tead of arguing, only declaim again&s;t them, and go on in a gradation of con&s;equences drawn from fal&s;e premi&s;es, till they have dragged them from their true character of ho|ne&s;t men, to that of u&s;urpers, rioters, and felons. Although the quotations from our authors have already been lengthy, yet that a precedent of their inju&s;tice may not here be want|ed, the following, from the third page of their appendix is in&s;erted.</P>
<P><Q>BUT though the &s;ame principles have been explained, and enforced in &s;everal acts and proclamations of govern|ment, as well as on repeated trials in our courts of judica|tory,
<PB N="169" REF="016183_0169_0F9BCCCD92D8BCD0">they have left no &s;uitable impre&s;&s;ion on the conten|tious claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> On the contrary, in contempt of the dictates of ju&s;tice, the deci&s;ions of law, and the civil authority, have their encroachments, which were few in number at the time of the royal determinati|on, been increa&s;ed and extended in a tenfold proportion; and that in general by men, who cannot plead that they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim, which it appears, were too notorious to have e&s;|caped their ob&s;ervation, but who in &s;pite of every warn|ing and remon&s;trance to deter them, which human pru|dence could devi&s;e, engaged as volunteers on the &s;ide of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and wilfully plunged them&s;elves into the controver&s;y. To extenuate their own indi&s;cretion and mi&s;conduct, calumny and mi&s;repre&s;entation are their only re&s;ource; and accordingly without the lea&s;t rea&s;on, they charge the government of <HI>New-York</HI> with partiality, and every land holder under it, upon whom they have tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ed, with inju&s;tice and and oppre&s;&s;ion; a&s;&s;erting, that becau&s;e they have &s;anctified their claim by a wrongful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they ought peacebly to enjoy the fruits of their u&s;urpation. To mortify their pretentions they have &s;par|ed no art or act of violence, however criminal; and after all, as if they were really injured, and the objects of regard, they do not he&s;itate to carry their complaints to the throne, and by &s;pecial agents to &s;olicit &s;ome extraordinary act of favour, by which their offences may be pa&s;&s;ed over with impunity, and their encroachments perpetuated in prejudice to tho&s;e who enjoy a clear title from the crown, under the great &s;eal of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As this clamorous quotation is already mo&s;tly an&s;wered, &s;hall only remark, as to tho&s;e &s;ettlers extending their en|croachments in a ten fold proportion, &s;ince the royal deter|mination. It hath been fully evinced that this determina|tion re&s;pected juri&s;diction only, and the before recited royal order and report of the board of trade, were accounted &s;uffi|cient to exclude all manner of doubts in the minds of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> claimants of the validity of their title. They
<PB N="170" REF="016183_0170_0F9BCCCE547E8560">truly cannot plead that <Q>they were deceived or ignorant of the nature or merit of their claim.</Q> This matter was elucidated by the highe&s;t wi&s;dom and authority in the nati|on; they rejoice in the clemency of their &s;overeign, and in the wi&s;dom and impartial ju&s;tice of the honourable board of trade, exhibited as afore&s;aid, upon which encouragement tho&s;e claimants have greatly extended &s;ettlements on tho&s;e lands, in a more &s;pecial manner on <HI>Onion</HI> river and lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> between the town&s;hip of <HI>Panton,</HI> which abuts on the lake oppo&s;ite <HI>Crown Point,</HI> and the &s;aid river, and north of it almo&s;t to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and preparations are vigorou&s;ly making to extend the&s;e &s;ettle|ments to the very bounds of the province of <HI>Quebec</HI> It is &s;eldom any new country &s;ettles with &s;uch rapidity, notwith|&s;tanding the oppo&s;itions they meet with from the govern|ment of <HI>New York:</HI> The expence of clearing roads, building mills, moving to and &s;ettling in that wilderne&s;s country only for two years la&s;t pa&s;t, would amount to no very incon&s;ide|rable &s;um. And tho&s;e &s;ettlers from the foregoing rea&s;ons, do not in the lea&s;t he&s;itate, but that they in &s;o fulfilling the conditions of their charters, have and are acting agreeable to his maje&s;ty's will and plea&s;ure; and that tho&s;e labours will not only be for their own emolument, but for the enlarge|ment of the Briti&s;h empire, and addition of the crown reve|nue.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> have been very particular in their hi&s;tory of the tumults and ri|ots made by tho&s;e &s;ettlers, in oppo&s;ition to that government, (many of which facts mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be true) though they have carefully o|mitted their manyfold provocations, yet, with all their par|ticularity have given but a very imperfect idea of tho&s;e tran&s;actions. I &s;hall here, therefore, waving particulars, give a general review of the oeconomy of tho&s;e &s;ettlers in their op|po&s;itions to that government. For defending their proper|ties, they were indicted rioters, the next thing was to defend rioters; then they had two objects of protection, viz. their per&s;ons, as well as property: They were at fir&s;t greatly in|timidated at the empty appearance of law, that their oppo|nents
<PB N="171" REF="016183_0171_0F9BCCCF11434FC0">were &s;o conver&s;ant with, &s;ometimes de&s;pairing of maintaining their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; yet upon extremity, rather than quit their &s;ub&s;tance to the in&s;atiable ravi&s;hers, would rally and fru&s;trate their de&s;igns: Thus, when the &s;heriff of the county of <HI>Albany</HI> with his po&s;&s;e came to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of them, they mo&s;t generally, boldly took up arms and ap|pointed leaders. Matters having come to this, not long af|ter, the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled and appointed committees of &s;afety in the &s;everal towns throughout their &s;ettlement; this general committee have the conducting of the public affairs of the country for its &s;ecurity, till his maje&s;ty &s;ettles the controver&s;y. They have erected &s;everal companies, which by the votes of the &s;oldiers are furni&s;hed with officers, the&s;e companies form a regiment which are known by the &s;ignifi|cant character of <HI>green mountain boys,</HI> who are generally in the prime of life, well ver&s;ed in the u&s;e of fire arms, and of robu&s;t con&s;titutions; probably no American regiment in an interior defence could excel them, or that would willingly contribute to the &s;upport of the crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch &s;ubjects that will not fight for their property, will never fight for their king. And, the ge|neral in&s;tructions from the committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing again&s;t the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but on the defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>IT is in the nature of things impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a right judgment on the conduct of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;ettlers, without taking into view the treatment of the government of <HI>New-York</HI> towards them. All ca&s;es mu&s;t be determined upon the peculiar circum&s;tances attending; no act can &s;carcely be conceived of, which, under certain attending circum&s;tances might not be lawful. It will be readily ad|mitted on the part of tho&s;e &s;ettlers, that, provided the go|vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> and its patentees have a clear and in|conte&s;tible right to tho&s;e lands; and that they are intruders, and by force and violence have maintained &s;uch encroach|ments, then, they are truly guilty, in manner as the a&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>New-York</HI> have alledged: But on the contrary, if tho&s;e &s;ettlers have a legal and inconte&s;tible right to tho&s;e
<PB N="172" REF="016183_0172_0F9BCCCFD125BD70">lands, that they pro&s;ecute &s;ettlement on the good faith of that title, and the &s;undry approbations of both their title and &s;ettlement from the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, then, they are not guilty in manner as tho&s;e gentlemen have declared; and the impartial public, in&s;tead of viewing them as u&s;urp|ers, rioters and felons, will ju&s;tify them in their conduct, and e&s;teem them as good members of &s;ociety, leige &s;ubjects to the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and good &s;oldiers for defending their per&s;ons and properties.</P>
<P>THUS, is humbly &s;ubmitted the &s;tate of the controver&s;y, which has for many years &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the government of <HI>New-York</HI> and the &s;ettlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> by im|partial ju&s;tice mu&s;t every act &s;tand or fall; if tho&s;e &s;ettlers are in the wrong, they are criminally &s;o, but if not, then the allegations of their opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</P>
