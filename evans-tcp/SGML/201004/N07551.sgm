<P>Take! Aye Man, by my Faith, three Parts of the City &s;eem to approve of it, if their Minds don't change with the next Wind that blows.&mdash;Why, Bro|ther Zealot, there are Hundreds in Philadelphia tap|ping their Neighbours on the Shoulder, and &s;aying, It is a prodigious &s;harp Thing: Yes it is a very &s;mart thing, &s;ays the other;&mdash; Poor Fellows! I didn't once think the Paxton-Boys had &s;uch Provocation and Grievances to provoke them to do as they did, but now I don't wonder at them.&mdash; I a&s;&s;ure you our Remon|&s;trance has gain'd us many Pro&s;elytes, and many of the Philadelphians to our Party. Aye, aye, and it is my Opinion, that if the Governor and A&s;&s;embly will not grant all and each of our rea&s;onable Requirements, and redre&s;s our many Grievances; I &s;ay, 'tis my humble Opinion we, by our excellent little Book, &s;hall have more than half the Country, as well as three Parts of Phi|ladelphia, to back us when we give them the next Vi&s;it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Zeal.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, I mean this, I am not, on &s;econd Thoughts, &s;o much prejudiced in favour of our little Book as you are, nor perhaps as many of our carele&s;s giddy Readers; for tho not One in Fifty under&s;tands what he reads, or &s;eeks for Proofs for Propo&s;itions laid down, neither has Capacity to enter into the Spirit of the Au|thor: Yet there are Men quick-&s;ighted, both in City and Country, who, I'm afraid, will ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Fallacy of our Arguments, and the lightne&s;s of our Matter; and give me leave, Brother Scrivner, as I am a Party, as well as you, in writing this excellent Piece, and expect to be paid as well for it; I &s;ay give me leave to tell you, that I am not &s;o &s;anguine as you are, re&s;pecting it's Succe&s;s, notwith&s;tanding our &s;eeming rea&s;onable Remon&s;trances, cover'd over with a few tender Expre&s;|&s;ions, and thin, very thin Glo&s;&s;es; together with Pro|po&s;itions and A&s;&s;ertions without Proof, expre&s;s'd in bad Engli&s;h, and here and there in contradictory Terms; and many other Faults, which before they came out of the Pre&s;s, I was not aware of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Po&s;it.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lud! Oh Lud! Pray good reform'd Sir, have you no more than the&s;e few Faults to find with your own &s;weet Works and my witty Inventions? Oh my Heart! I believe the Man is going Mad! Why Zealot, do&s;t thou deny thy own Works?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zeal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr Po&s;itive, I don't deny my own Works; but I am afraid, as the Traytor Syphax once &s;aid to Sempronies his chief Captain, in a Ca&s;e paralel with this, <HI>Cato has piercing Eyes, and will di&s;cern our Frauds, unle&s;s they're cover'd thick with Art.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Zeal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon Sir, but perhaps this may not be &s;o great a Digre&s;&s;ion as &s;hallow Politicians may imagine, and as it &s;eems to offend you, I will drop it, and come to the Point at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Po&s;it.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, come to the Point at once; but I &s;wear you &s;hall never bring me into your Opinion, to
<PB N="4" REF="009638_0004_0F776C3B6BF65948">think that our Declaration and Remon&s;trance is either fal&s;e, fooli&s;h, or impertinent, or that it borders on Re|bellion. No, no, Mr. Zealot, &s;o far from Rebellion, that I wonder that all the witty Politicians and great Geniu&s;es in the Province, have not employed their Pens in applauding our never-to-be-forgotten Action at Lan|ca&s;ter; where we bravely conquer'd, our Eye not pity|ing, nor our Hand &s;paring either Age or Sex; exulting, as one of our modern Poets &s;ays, in the Widow's Wail, the Virgin's Shriek, and Infant's trembling Cry.&mdash; Oh Zealot! tell me not of Ca&s;&s;ius, Brutus, Cae&s;ar, Pompey, or even Alexander the Great! We! we Pax|ton Boys have done more than all, or any of them! We have, and it gives me Plea&s;ure to think on't, Slaugh|ter'd, kill'd and cut off a whole Tribe! a Nation at once!</P>

<SP>

<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it is not much Learning has made him mad, for &s;etting a&s;ide the common People of the Town, and tho&s;e many Readers, who judge of Books and Things like old Wives, for the &s;ake of pretty Glo&s;&s;es, and fabulous Stories; I &s;ay &s;etting a&s;ide the&s;e two Cla&s;|&s;es of People, there are three to one who &s;ay 'tis a weak and wicked Thing, and only &s;erves to make your very bad Cau&s;e &s;till wor&s;e.</P>

<P>Hey day! Hey day! Why this is wor&s;e and wor&s;e: I thought you would have been of my Side the Que&s;tion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I am a Man that loves the Truth; and I humbly think, that it is always the be&s;t Side of the Que&s;tion; and tho' it &s;hould be again&s;t my Intere&s;t with Man, yet if requir'd, I &s;hall, and mu&s;t, always
<PB N="5" REF="009638_0005_0F776C3BF12F4B18">declare my hone&s;t real Sentiments: And &s;o, Gentle|men, upon the Liberty you have ju&s;t now granted me, I &s;hall proceed in as brief a Manner as I po&s;&s;ibly can. Fir&s;t then, I &s;hall take Notice of the Title Page of your REMONSTRANCE.&mdash;After your courtly Compliments to the Honourable the Governor and A&s;&s;embly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash; Shewing the Cau&s;es of your late Di&s;content and Unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and which you <HI>humbly pray to have redre&s;s'd!</HI>&mdash; What Man in his Sen&s;es can help &s;miling at &s;uch a flag|rant Piece of Contradiction? Pray when was it ever known, that after a Herd, or Number of Rebels and Violent Men, had, contrary to Rea&s;on, Religion, and the Laws of Nations, as well as in Defiance of the good Laws of Government where they liv'd, had mur|der'd, kill'd, and cruelly ma&s;&s;acred a Number of Men, Women and Children, who for &s;o many Years had proved them&s;elves to be peaceful Subjects of the Go|vernment, and good Neighbours among&s;t tho&s;e where they re&s;ided; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e was ever &s;uch Audacity known, for People who have, and mu&s;t be con&s;cious they have &s;o heinou&s;ly offended, to pray to have Griev|ances redre&s;s'd, when they them&s;elves are the known Agre&s;&s;ors? Add to this their clamorous Threats again&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t worthy, u&s;eful and publick-&s;pirited Men in the City and Country, is &s;omething very dar|ing and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Po&s;it.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Interrupting.</HI> Why, Mr. <HI>Lovell,</HI> you talk &s;trangely! You mu&s;t certainly know that a great many of our Friends and Neighbours have been cruelly ma&s;|&s;acred, and others carried into barbarous Captivity a|mong&s;t the <HI>Indians.</HI> You know Revenge is &s;weet; and 'tis a common Saying, BLOOD REQUIRES BLOOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Po&s;itive, you've had it, and in your own Way too, and yet you are not &s;atisfied.&mdash; Now had your Vengeance fell on the Guilty, it would have much alter'd the Ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e a Brother of mine had kill'd a Relation of yours, would it be ju&s;t in you to kill me? That is as the Proverb is, not putting the Saddle on the right Hor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Po&s;it.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not our little Book ju&s;tify us? where|in
<PB N="6" REF="009638_0006_0F776C3CB97215D0">we have &s;o fully declar'd that nothing but Nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf, could induce us to do as we did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I &s;hall &s;peak to that bye and bye, when I have done with your Title Page; in which, &s;ay you, <HI>We humbly pray to have Redre&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Very humbly indeed! How? With Sword in Hand, Rifles, Toma|hawks, and other Implements of War? In Truth, if one don't mind what one &s;ays, a mighty humble Way of praying. I rather think the&s;e unhappy People &s;hould have come with Ropes about their forfeited Necks to &s;ue, as they call it, for Redre&s;s of Grievances; or rather, for Pardon of pa&s;t Guilt of &s;o black a Nature. For this kind of Conduct we have an extraordinary Precedent in the Fir&s;t Book of <HI>Kings,</HI> Chapter 20th, in which &s;ome of the Servants or Officers of King <HI>Benhadad</HI> wi&s;ely coun&s;el'd him to act in this Manner, (&s;ee <HI>Ver.</HI> 32.) <HI>So they girded Sackcloth on their Loins, and put Ropes on their Heads, and came to the King of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> &amp;c. For the re&s;t I refer you to the whole Pa&s;&s;age. Now, tho' I confe&s;s my Warmth, yet I cannot help feeling in my Heart a Tenderne&s;s and Pity for the&s;e my deluded Countrymen; and I can truly &s;ay, I could wi&s;h to God that they had followed the laudable Example of the&s;e wi&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, the <HI>Syrians</HI> of Old, in&s;tead of the ra&s;h, incon&s;iderate Method they &s;o violently pur&s;ued: For &s;ee <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 31, where it is &s;aid, <HI>Behold, &amp;c.</HI> I beg, without further Addition, to refer you to the whole Chapter, as nothing in Language can be better adapt|ed to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, by your Leave, for a Remark or two on your Declaration.&mdash; <HI>In a&s;much</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>as the killing the Indians at Conne&s;togo-Manor and Lan|ca&s;ter, has been, and may be the Subject of much Conver|&s;ation,</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o Wonder) <HI>and by invidious Repre&s;entations of it, which &s;ome, we doubt not, will indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, many unacquainted with the true State of Affairs, may be led to pa&s;s a &s;everer Cen&s;ure on the Authors of tho&s;e Facts, and any others of tho&s;e of like nature, which may hereafter happen, than we are per&s;uaded they would, if Matters were duly under&s;tood and deliberated!</HI>&mdash;How is it po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="7" REF="009638_0007_0F776C3DC5BAEF28">to pa&s;s a Con&s;ure &s;evere enough upon Rioters and Murderers in cool Blood? Let the Provocations be what they will, every humane tender Heart mu&s;t &s;hud|der at, and dete&s;t both the Facts and the Authors of them: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any, even their neare&s;t Re|lations, to offer one &s;ingle Argument of Weight in their Favour. But further; by your own Words, you &s;eem to have a De&s;ign of yet trampling on the Laws of Go|vernment, and committing the &s;ame Thing over again, when a convenient Opportunity offers; el&s;e what is the Meaning of the Words before mentioned, <HI>on the Au|thors of tho&s;e Facts, and others of the like nature, which may hereafter happen?</HI> Now, what becomes of this humble Praying? In &s;hort, it amounts to this, and ought to be read thus, "We the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI>" or rather, angry <HI>"bleeding,"</HI> or rather "<HI>bloody-minded, revenge|ful Inhabitants of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, <HI>do reque&s;t;</HI>" or ra|ther, <Q><HI>in&s;i&s;t, to have as many of the now pre&s;ent Laws and Acts of A&s;&s;embly aboli&s;hed, as &s;uit not our Inte|re&s;t, or is not agreeable to our Wills; and we will, when, and as &s;oon as it &s;uits our other Purpo&s;es, let the Honourable Governor and A&s;&s;embly know our further Plea&s;ure.</HI></Q>&mdash;You farther &s;ay, in Page 3, <HI>We think it proper, thus openly to declare our&s;elves.</HI> And what is this Declaration? Why, that we are not &s;orry that we have knowingly and deliberately violated the Laws of Government, <HI>for we do frankly confe&s;s, that nothing but Nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf could induce us to it.</HI> To what? To down|right Rebellion and Murder:&mdash;Audacious and horrid Confe&s;&s;ion indeed! And then call it a <HI>&s;eeming,</HI> or <HI>bear|ing an Appearance of flying in the Face of Government and Authority!</HI>&mdash; But how ea&s;y is it for any one that is not prejudiced in your Favour, to &s;ee through &s;uch thin Glo&s;&s;es and mean Sophi&s;try? In Line 18, you &s;ay, <HI>And is attended with much Labour, Fatigue and Expence.</HI> O dear! This is neither new nor &s;trange! &mdash; When was it ever known that an angry, giddy, violent and revengeful People, fir&s;t &s;at down and counted the Co&s;t, or would be per&s;uaded to &s;top their mad Career, till their Folly had run them aground, and brought them
<PB N="8" REF="009638_0008_0F776C3E6F98B910">to a too late Repentance? But as I can only touch up|on Things, I &s;hall conclude this Head with telling you, that if &s;uch an Affair had happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> it would have brought your Leaders to the common Gal|lows, or to have had the Honour of a new one erected on Pupo&s;e for them; and your poor deluded Followers, to Tran&s;portation for Life.&mdash;Now, Gentlemen, I will for Brevity's Sake, omit taking Notice of tho&s;e ri|diculous uncertain Stories of a certain injured Society in this City, as they appear to be without any Proof, Weight or Signification.&mdash; If even they could be proved, this could be no Excu&s;e for Rebellion, Sedi|tion and Murder, putting a whole City in a Panic, and the Country in an Uproar and Surprize.&mdash;But what can you po&s;&s;ibly mean by your notable Harangue, in Page 9? <HI>And can it be thought &s;trange</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>that a Scene of &s;uch Treatment at this Time, and now adding at this critical Juncture to all our former Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the di&s;agreeable Burden of &s;upporting in the very Heart of the Province, at &s;o great an Expence, between one and two Hundred Savages, to the great Di&s;quietude of the Majority of the good Inhabitants of this Province,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And mu&s;t not</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>all well-di&s;po&s;ed People entertain a charitable Sentiment of tho&s;e, who, at their own great Expence and Trouble, have attempted, or &s;hall yet attempt, to re&s;cue a labouring Land from a Weight &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t? It is this we de&s;ign, it is this we are re|&s;olved to pro&s;ecute; tho' it is with great Reluctance, we are obliged to adapt a Mea&s;ure not &s;o agreable as could be de&s;ired and to which Extremity alone compels.</HI>&mdash; Pray, Gentlemen, what do you mean by <HI>&s;upporting at a great Expence, between one and two Hundred Savages, to your great Di&s;quietude,</HI> &amp;c.?</P>

<P>Alas, Sir! how &s;trangely mi&s;taken are you, as well as many Hundreds more, whom I've heard ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves in this random Way; either not know|ing, or not di&s;tingui&s;hing, between Savage Indians, Heathen Indians, and Chri&s;tian Indians. &mdash; Now, Gentlemen, through the tender Mercy of their and
<PB N="9" REF="009638_0009_0F776C404B52D590">your Creator, who is one God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever|more; I &s;ay, through him, who&s;e tender Mercies are over all his Works, and before who&s;e Eye the Colour of the Skin is nothing, hath been plea&s;ed in his bound|le&s;s Compa&s;&s;ion, to &s;end Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters among&s;t them, and the&s;e few, out of the many Thou&s;ands in <HI>America,</HI> have embraced and receiv'd the joyful Report of the Go&s;pel: And further, they have, after believing in JESUS, been baptized in his Name, and into his Death, who is both their Lord and ours. And again, many of the&s;e Savages, as they are called, have, and do yet, partake of the Lord's Supper, or Holy Communion; and 'tis not only a Plea&s;ure, but A&s;toni&s;hing, when one conver&s;es with them, to find how well grounded they are in the Principles and Doctrines of the Old and New Te&s;taments, and our reform'd Religion.&mdash;One Thing more I would ob&s;erve, which to me, is a &s;tronger Proof yet, of their being rooted and grounded in the Living Power and Faith of the Go&s;pel; and that is, at the Time of the late Tumult, when mo&s;t of the People be|lieved that the Rioters from the Frontiers had their Eye chiefly again&s;t them, to cut them off from the Land of the Living, both Root and Branch; yet through the Time of this deep Calamity, their &s;erene Looks and quiet Deportment, plainly indicated an upright Heart, and a Mind at ea&s;e; and this even in the View of an approaching and untimely Death, by wicked and cruel Hands, already &s;tain'd with Human Blood. I my&s;elf have vi&s;ited them two or three Times in their pre&s;ent Exile, and have always found them to be free, plea|&s;ant, calm and unruffled, <HI>Like a Summer's Sea, when not a Breath of Wind flies o'er its Surface.</HI></P>

<P>Well Mr. Po&s;itive, &s;ince it offends you &s;o much, I will drop this Subject of our Di&s;cour&s;e, and come to a Conclu&s;ion, as you harden your Mind again&s;t Conviction, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e Reproof. Therefore, a few Remarks more, and I have done; as to the great Expence you complain of, are not you your&s;elves the ab&s;olute Cau&s;e of it? Is it not to the Horror of the Go|vernment? And did not you oblige them to take tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People under their fatherly Protection, to &s;ave a con&s;iderable Number from De&s;truction? And where could they be &s;afer than here, from the Fury and Rage of an incen&s;ed, riotous and lawle&s;s Mob? You are the la&s;t that &s;hould complain of this Expence, as you your|&s;elves are the Occa&s;ion of it. And further, the Nece&s;|&s;ity of keeping them here, evidently appears from your in&s;olent and daring Confe&s;&s;ion in the four la&s;t Lines of your Declaration: <HI>It is this</HI> (you &s;ay) <HI>we de&s;ign, it is this we are re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash; Yes, yes, if we may judge of your future, by your late trea&s;onable Conduct, we may take your Word for it, without &s;wearing to it: And, to make U&s;e of your own Words above, <HI>Will not the good Inhabitants of this Province, and all well-di&s;po&s;ed People, awaken to Re&s;entment, and put them&s;elves in Readine&s;s to repel, if fair Argument won't do; I &s;ay, repel Force to Force, and &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;e &s;uch lawle&s;s Rioters;</HI> who, in the Conclu&s;ion of their Threatenings and Demands pretend to &s;ay, though in Contradiction to their Actions, GOD SAVE THE KING. &mdash;What unprejudiced impartial Man, after a delibe|rate Reflection on all they have done and &s;aid, will view their <HI>Declaration</HI> in any other Light than a &s;ophi&s;tical Piece of Irony, artfully in&s;inuating into the Minds of the Ignorant and Vulgar, that they are, as they &s;ay in ano|ther Place, <HI>attach'd to the Per&s;on and Reign of our dear Sovereign King George the Third?</HI>&mdash; Is not their Con|duct too much like that notorious wicked Traytor who at the Head of a tumultuous Mob, came up to his Lord with a <HI>Hail Ma&s;ter,</HI> and ki&s;&s;ed him?</P>

<P>Why pray what Harm did we do in coming down to <HI>Philadelphia?</HI> We neither killed nor hurt any Body; and every one that &s;aw us, mu&s;t &s;ay we were very civil.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, you were &s;o, and &s;o are common Highwaymen, if you do not re&s;i&s;t them; there are &s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who when they &s;top a Coach, and make their Demands&mdash;Gentlemen and Ladies, pray don't be frightened, we won't hurt you, only give us our Demand&mdash;<HI>your Pur&s;e Madam&mdash;If you plea&s;e, that Gold Watch Sir</HI>&mdash;Oh pray don't be angry with us, who are hone&s;t Gentlemen, and Men of Honour, and love our King and Country; but Nece&s;&s;ity, Nece&s;&s;ity obliges us to do this, therefore you mu&s;t excu&s;e us.&mdash;<HI>Gentle|men, your mo&s;t humble Servant</HI>&mdash; GOD SAVE THE KING.&mdash; Rides off.</P>

<P>I think, Sir, you bear a little too hard upon us here.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; Tumult, Sedition and Rebellion, [and more &s;o when they are attended with cruel Mur|ders] are more inexcu&s;able than the Wretches I allude to, who have &s;ometimes a better Right to plead Nece&s;|&s;ity, than many of the Abettors of our lawle&s;s Frontier Inhabitants.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zeal.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir, I am credibly inform'd that there are Gentlemen of Learning and Judgment, who &s;ay our Book is a well wrote Thing; particularly &mdash; &mdash;, and a few more very knowing and topping Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, Sir; I know who you mean: But are not the&s;e Party-men; warm Bigots, attach'd only to them of their own Community? which Community is well known to be an a&s;piring People, who, when
<PB N="12" REF="009638_0012_0F776C42C77F3850">they have attain'd their Aim, or gotten the Reins of Government in their Fi&s;ts, have gra&s;p'd it hard, and drove on Jehu-like; or which is more to the Purpo&s;e, like that conceited giddy-headed Fellow who thought him&s;elf &s;ufficient to guide the Chariot of the Sun, &s;oon, very &s;oon, &s;et the World on Fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zeal</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, good Sir, when was it ever known that we Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters di&s;cover'd an angry per&s;ecut|ing Spirit? We are indeed a very zealous People, and we think it our Duty to be &s;o; be&s;ides, if I remember right, I have either read or heard that our Fore-fathers have &s;uffer'd and been per&s;ecuted for this &s;ame good Cau&s;e, namely, for being <HI>Pre&s;byterians.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, I will allow the latter Part of your Argument, it is true: At the Time when a Paper War was carried on, and libelling between <HI>Conformi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Non-conformi&s;t</HI> prevailed, your Predece&s;|&s;ors and Fore-fathers did &s;uffer a good many Things, and &s;tood it out bravely: I believe al&s;o, that there was many great and good Men who became of that Sect, and were an Honour to the Religion they profe&s;s'd.&mdash; But alas how is the Scene changed? The Crown is fallen from your Heads; or, as one of your own Poets elegantly expre&s;&s;es it,&mdash; <HI>Happy the Times; but ah! tho&s;e Times are gone, when wond'rous Power and radiant Grace round the tall Arches of the Temple &s;hone,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Indeed in the&s;e Times when <HI>Non-conformi&s;ts</HI> were but comparitively few in Number, and were a Laughing-Stock to others, then, and for many Years after, true Religion, Zeal, and a Spirit of Love, prevailed glo|riou&s;ly: But when they became more numerous, and the Mini&s;ters and People more rich, they began to a&s;|pire after worldly Power and Greatne&s;s, their Godly Zeal abated, and in its Stead grew up Bigotry, Super|&s;tition and Party-Zeal; and by Degrees, the &s;ame bitter per&s;ecuting Spirit by which their Fore-fathers were per|&s;ecuted took Place in them, and continues more or le&s;s unto this Day: From hence it is, they are divided and &s;ub-divided into &s;o many Sects and Parties, every one
<PB N="13" REF="009638_0013_0F776C4430DFC7A0">thinking them&s;elves mo&s;t Orthodox, and condemning and charging their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren with Error Here&s;y and Schi&s;m, who don't jump into each of their Opinions. &mdash; For the Proof of this we need not go beyond the Seas; even in this City it is too glaringly manife&s;t, by the inte&s;tine Broils and Schi&s;ms that have lately happen|ed; &s;o that not the meek and peaceful Spirit of the great Founder of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> prevails, but unhappily a Spi|rit of a very contrary Nature; though we are expre&s;sly told in &s;acred Writ, that where Contention is, there is every evil Work. 'Tis grievous to &s;ee what Heat and Bitterne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the Brea&s;ts of many PRESBYTERI|ANS in this Town, as well as in the Country, again&s;t the People called QUAKERS.&mdash; It truely &s;eems as if &s;ome make it their Study, as well as Boa&s;t, to a&s;per&s;e, vilify and blacken the fair Character they have generally maintained for &s;o many Years in all Places throughout the Chri&s;tian World, where there are any of that Socie|ty living.&mdash;And let me further ob&s;erve here, the ex|treme &s;evere and cruel Treatment the&s;e People met with in <HI>New England,</HI> where they not only endured cruel Mockings and Scourgings, but Impri&s;onment, and even Death, for CHRIST's Sake.&mdash; Let us not recount the Cruelty of PAPISTS, when even DISSEN|TERS have been guilty of per&s;ecuting <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> break|ing up their Meetings for publick Wor&s;hip, plundering their Hou&s;es, hauling Men and Women to Pri&s;on, &s;trip|ping, whipping and cutting off their Ears, bani&s;hing, and at la&s;t, hanging them, <HI>till they,</HI> as their cruel Judges u&s;ed often to expre&s;s it, <HI>till they were dead.</HI></P>

<P>One Minute's Patience more, and I have done. If I &s;hould recount but even the hundredth Part of tho&s;e cruel Wrongs and Indignities practi&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e innocent and u&s;eful Body of People on account of their Religion, the Time would fail me: I &s;hall there|fore only refer you to <HI>Sewell</HI>'s and <HI>Be&s;s</HI>'s Hi&s;tories of the Sufferings of that People, from tho&s;e who call

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Countrymen and Brethren in Community,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have been a Member of one of your Congregati|ons for more than twenty Years, and am yet &s;o in a good Sen&s;e, tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot &s;o readily fall in with your new-fangled Doctrines and Manners, ne|verthele&s;s I mu&s;t love and wi&s;h you well.&mdash; I do mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech and intreat you to fit down and &s;eriou&s;|ly con&s;ider what Spirit you are actuated by: Why are the Quakers, your good Neighbours, &s;o fal&s;ely and &s;lan|derou&s;ly abus'd by you? Why do you endeavour to vin|dicate or le&s;&s;en the Crimes of tho&s;e lawle&s;s Rioters, more fatal to a Commonwealth than Thieves and Rob|bers? Why do you abet their tottering trea&s;onable Cau&s;e, while you fling Dirt and Mire on Government and your worthy peaceable Neighbours? Why do you &s;hake your Heads and grin with your Teeth, as tho', if it were in your Power, you would bite and devour them up, even as a Mor&s;el of Bread?</P>
<P>But as a Word to the Wi&s;e is enough, let me intreat you, my dear Brethren, to lay a&s;ide all Malice, Revenge and Evil-&s;peaking, and to cultivate that &s;weet, amiable and happy Temper of loving one another for Chri&s;t's Sake, that we may prove our&s;elves to be the Children of the Day (and not of the Night) by all Acts of faithful tender Love and brotherly Kindne&s;s, &s;peaking the Truth every one to his Neighbour.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009638_0015_0F776C4556842900">
One Word more, Gentlemen, and to come clo&s;e to you, I appeal to your &s;elves:&mdash;Have not you, with your Mini&s;ters, often join'd in Prayer to GOD, that he would be pleas'd to &s;end his Go&s;pel among the <HI>Hea|then?</HI> And do you not continue &s;till to do &s;o in your public A&s;&s;emblie? And I think you cannot be ignorant that the Government at Home, as well as the Religi|ous Societies there, have at much Pains and Expence, &s;ent many of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries into the&s;e Parts for this laudable and Chri&s;tian Purpo&s;e <HI>viz.</HI> To direct their Feet in the right Way, and to bring them to the Know|ledge of the Truth as it is in <HI>JESUS;</HI> and that their Labours have not been in vain, or altogether fruitle&s;s, is exceedingly evident from this Circum&s;tance; it is well known that there are five or &s;ix Societies of con|verted, once <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>Savage Indians:</HI> And how mu&s;t it hurt and retard their Progre&s;s in the Chri&s;tian Life, to find them&s;elves &s;o grievou&s;ly u&s;ed and per&s;e|cuted by their profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;tian Friends?</HI> And how do you think our SAVIOUR and common LORD mu&s;t look upon this your evil and unkind Treatment of your Fellow Servants? Do you not make your&s;elves ob|noxious to that &s;harp Reprehen&s;ion in the 12th Chapter of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> Ver. xlv? For Shame, &s;uffer your Eyes to be open'd, and your Hearts to become affected to|wards the&s;e poor &s;uffering Exiles, and begrudge them not that &s;canty Pittance allow'd them by our good Go|vernor and A&s;&s;embly for their pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tance.&mdash; I mention this, becau&s;e I have heard many with ill tim|ed Heat, Zeal and Ill-nature, expre&s;s great Di&s;&s;atis|faction again&s;t the Government for this very kind and benevolant Act of Charity, at this Juncture become &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable, and which, I doubt not, our gracious and bountiful LORD takes No|tice of, and will reward an hundred Fold, &s;ince a Cup of Water given in his Name, &s;hall not go unnoticed by him, tho' be&s;tow'd on the lea&s;t or poore&s;t of his Fol|lowers.</P>

Let me conclude, my dear Fellow Mortals, with this excellent Advice from Scripture, <HI>Be careful le&s;t you be found Fighters again&s;t GOD, calling Light Darkne&s;s and Darkne&s;s Light, putting Good for Evil and Evil for Good.</HI></P>
