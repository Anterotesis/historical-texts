<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following &s;heets by the author will inform you, that in the&s;e la&s;t ages of the world, the my&s;tery of iniquity has advanced near to its perfection. It may be a que&s;tion with &s;ome, whether the following piece is a true relation of tho&s;e facts declared, and there|fore it may loo&s;e its weight and authority in &s;uch minds. Under this view of the matter, I think it my duty to endeavour to enforce the truth of &s;aid piece, by &s;hewing fir&s;t my acquaintance with the &s;everal matters in&s;ert|ed. 2dly. By acquainting the reader with the character of the author through the general cour&s;e of his life. 3dly. By &s;hewing the mo|tives that induced the author to write the following piece, letterwi&s;e to <HI>James Whittacor.</HI> 4thly. To alarm, awaken, and quicken all to watchfulne&s;s in this day of dangers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then&mdash;Re&s;pecting my knowledge and acquaintance with the &s;everal matters in&s;ert|ed in the author's piece. Ever &s;ince the fir&s;t appearance of the European &s;cheme, I have had a careful and watchful eye on it; and conclude I have kept pace with it in my ob|&s;ervations,
<PB N="iv" REF="019212_0003_0FAA6747ED30C578">and am fully &s;en&s;ible of the truth of &s;aid piece in a general view; tho' there may be &s;ome particular things in &s;aid piece which I have not &s;een with my eyes and heard with my ears; yet I have no doubt of the truth of them, if I may judge of the product from the principle. I fully know their doc|trines in general&mdash;particularly as to their doc|trine of perfection; the doctrine of one &s;u|preme earthly head; the doctrine of an earth|ly tribunal, to judge the whole world; the doctrine of the re&s;urrection day being now come; the doctrine of the dead daily ri&s;ing by thou&s;ands; the doctrine of making &s;atis|faction for &s;in committed by &s;uffering here or in hell, and after payment is made, then to receive redemption and go to heaven; the doctrine of celibacy; the doctrine of a new di&s;pen&s;ation, in which they are beyond the bible; the doctrine of miracles done among them, and many other doctrines, too tedious to mention in a preface. I am fully &s;en&s;ible, that their doctrines in general exactly agree with the doctrines of the church of Rome, hav|ing not only been acquainted with the Romi&s;h religion by hi&s;tory; but having been in the Romi&s;h dominions, and &s;een and heard for my&s;elf; but I really think that in the church of Rome, the mi&s;tery of iniquity never aro&s;e to &s;o high a key as it has in the&s;e people call|ed
<PB N="v" REF="019212_0004_0FAA6748B8131270">Shakers; and if it be po&s;&s;ible in tho&s;e Shakers, the devil has outdone him&s;elf. As to the practice and conduct of tho&s;e people called Shakers, I really think the author of the following piece in&s;tead of exaggerating, and carrying things beyond the truth, has fell almo&s;t infinitely &s;hort of what might be &s;aid with truth. I think it not nece&s;&s;ary in this &s;hort information to enter the li&s;t of par|ticulars in their conduct; for it would be as impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;ent the whole to view, as to found the ocean where there is no bottom, or to count all the &s;tars in the heavens.</P>
<P>2dly. I come to acquaint the reader with the character of the author to the following piece. As to his general character through the world, I am under peculiar advantages to know it&mdash;he being brought up with me, and for a &s;eries of about fifty years, my connection and acquaintance has been continued, and I mu&s;t own; acknowledge and declare, that I never knew of any blot, blemi&s;h, or &s;candal ever cleaving to him, or his character, any more than what is common in the be&s;t of men, who are all &s;ubject to the common infirmities of human nature. I ever found him a &s;trictly hone&s;t man in all his dealings; and for many years he has been a profe&s;&s;or of religion, and a member of a church. And as I was conver|&s;ant with him often, while he was writing the
<PB N="vi" REF="019212_0005_0FAA67496D0D7280">following piece, I ever found him exceeding careful in his writing not to go beyond his knowledge in things, and to u&s;e as &s;oft terms as po&s;&s;ibly would do, to give any idea of the matter. And I have ever found him remark|ably free from prejudice again&s;t the Shakers, which is a thing rarely to be found among tho&s;e that have &s;uffered le&s;s than he has by them. It is therefore my opinion, that the publick may freely receive his piece as the real truth. There is one thing that may per|haps &s;tumble &s;ome minds, which is, that &s;uch a man &s;hould be taken in by &s;o diabolical a &s;cheme; but in an&s;wer to this, it may be re|membered what we read in the prophet Dan|iel, 11 chap.&mdash;35 ver&s;e, and &s;ome of them of under&s;tanding &s;hall fall to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; and again, when we con&s;ider the power of Anti-Chri&s;t, that if it were po&s;&s;i|ble the elect &s;hould be deceived by it, while it appears in the deceivable dre&s;s of high &s;anc|tity and holine&s;s in this day of declen&s;ion, in which many errors abound. The con&s;idera|tion of which may remove tho&s;e doubts and open the way for charity to be exerci&s;ed. But if any are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to wonder, then there is a greater wonder, then why the author of the following piece was taken in by the Shak|ers, which is, how our father Adam came to
<PB N="vii" REF="019212_0006_0FAA674A38536348">fall into &s;in, who was perfect, and without any &s;inful propen&s;ities in his nature, as he came out of the hands of God? When this que&s;tion is an&s;wered, the other may be re&s;olved more ea&s;ily. The author's hope was of greater good in which he fell, and &s;o was Adam's, for which he fell.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the third thing propo&s;ed, by &s;hewing the motives that induced the author to write letterwi&s;e to <HI>James Whittacor.</HI> Fir&s;t. As James Whittacor is the chief Elder, and has the whole controul of his church and all its di&s;ciples, the author has therefore wrote to him, and laid in his objections again&s;t him and his &s;cheme, in order thereby to convince him if po&s;&s;ible of his ill policy and wicked craft in his grand deception impo&s;ed on man|kind&mdash;and that it might check his wild career for the future.&mdash;2dly. Another motive that induced the author to write letterwi&s;e was, that the di&s;ciples of &s;aid Whittacor might be convicted by it, e&s;pecially re&s;pecting them, as well as their leaders, that &s;o they might be recovered from the &s;nares of death before it be too late, and brought to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. 3dly. A third motive that induced the author to write letterwi&s;e was, that as his greate&s;t difficulty was with &s;aid Whittacor, and not being al|lowed to &s;tate his objections, and tell him his
<PB N="viii" REF="019212_0007_0FAA674AEB70FCA8">faults face to face, the author therefore tho't it his duty to keep as near the rule of the go&s;|pel as might be in writing to him in particu|lar, that &s;aid Whittacor might take it to him|&s;elf, and have fair opportunity to make an&s;|wer in his own vindication; or to confe&s;s his faults and make &s;atisfaction. Or finally at la&s;t, to be left without excu&s;e in the day of trial. 4thly. A fourth motive that induced the author to write letterwi&s;e was this, The author was not in&s;en&s;ible that in every &s;ubject that belongs to the &s;y&s;tem of truth, the mo&s;t eligible method would be to divide the &s;ub|ject into as many propo&s;itions as naturally a|ri&s;e, and con&s;ider each one in its &s;everal parts&mdash;all which will coincide one with another.</P>
<P>But in the &s;ubject he has undertaken to pre&s;ent to publick view there is nothing but confu&s;ion, incon&s;i&s;tency, and oppo&s;ition, even to it&s;elf. He has therefore cho&s;en &s;uch a me|thod as would give him the large&s;t latitude to follow it in all its cramp corners&mdash;&s;kulking holes, and winding paths, where it hides it&s;elf from the vulgar eye&mdash;for in the way of letter writing there is full liberty to catch the &s;everal parts where they may be found; to reach forward to that which is before, and bring up that which is behind&mdash;make refer|ences and inferences at every turn. The&s;e are &s;ome of the rea&s;ons no doubt which moved the author to write letterwi&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="019212_0008_0FAA674BAE7DFE28">
I now proceed 4thly to the alarming con|&s;ideration of what we find contained in the following piece; together with other frauds that lead to de&s;truction, that it might awaken and quicken all to a careful watchfulne&s;s, in this day of dangers.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the privileges both civil &amp; &s;acred that we as a people are indulged with, and what might ju&s;tly be expected by God from us as a people in general in humble thankfulne&s;s, and a wi&s;e improvement of all his mercies&mdash;I &s;ay the ble&s;&s;ings of God, both in his providence and grace, lays us under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to be a reformed, re|ligious, holy people; ever being found in &s;uitable returns to GOD for all his benefits. But in&s;tead of this, or &s;uch a line of conduct, how &s;ad is the &s;tate of religion, and how much more deplorable is the &s;tate of the world in general. A great part of the people irre|ligious and profane. Many others that do not &s;o much as make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and &s;till many others that make a profe&s;&s;ion are under the power and dominion of Anti-Chri&s;t, and counterfeit religion&mdash;pa&s;&s;ing for true coin, and none or very few laying of it to heart. Now many, lo here, and lo there, are &s;ounding in our world, and many powerful in&s;truments &s;ent out by the arch enemy,to &s;educe and lead mankind a&s;tray, and the na|tural product is errour, here&s;y, idolatry,
<PB N="x" REF="019212_0009_0FAA674C86AACD68">novelty, and abominable impieties, which are introduced for religion. But a few out of the great whole of the people in our land that are true fearers of God, and &s;tand cloathed with his word. The deceivers and deceived have formed and maintained a perfect religious bedlam in our world, while dei&s;m and athei&s;m in con&s;equence prevail. This indeed is a day of dangers, if I now advert to the corrupt &s;cheme di&s;covered by the following piece.&mdash;There we may find many hundreds of poor deluded people carried captive, who are made perfect &s;laves to their leaders. Many have gone down to the grave thro' labour and hard fatigue, under the orders of their teachers. Many others have broke and de&s;troyed their con&s;titutions. Many in a decaying and dying &s;tate, and yet drove on with &s;everity and ri|gour by their hard hearted Pharoah-like ma&s;|ters, while their leaders live on the &s;poils of their di&s;ciples, and wallow in wealth and ca&s;e, and regale them&s;elves in rioting and drunken|ne&s;s, in chambering and wantonne&s;s. The&s;e things are truly alarming, and ought to wake us up to attention and watchfulne&s;s; e&s;pecial|ly while we con&s;ider, that while we are e&s;cap|ing one &s;nare, another is ready to take us. It is evidently the la&s;t days of the world, in which every method is taken by the arch ene|my to &s;educe mankind and de&s;troy their &s;ouls. Every thing is drawing to a clo&s;e, and ripen|ing
<PB N="xi" REF="019212_0010_0FAA674E9346B140">for the final event. The &s;tate of mankind by the fall is &s;uch, they are oppo&s;ed to noth|ing &s;o much as to their own &s;alvation, in the way God has propo&s;ed, by his Son in the Go&s;|pel; and therefore every fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of reli|gion is more readily embraced by a blind and ignorant world. What an awful &s;urpri&s;e will all fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors meet with in the final con|clu&s;ion, when it is too late to recover them|&s;elves. Under this view of the matter, let us all watch and pray, le&s;t we enter into temp|tations: and let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c. TO ELDER JAMES WHITTACOR,</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;o long a connection with you, it appears to me but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould let you know the cau&s;e and rea|&s;ons of my declen&s;ion from you&mdash;&s;ome of which I have made known to you in the cour&s;e of our travels together; but never having my mind an&s;wered, and that you might have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, I have now undertook to &s;tate my objections in writing, and &s;upport them by the be&s;t authority I can, or lay my|&s;elf open to be refuted.</P>
<P>It is true I &s;et out with you in the &s;implicity of my &s;oul, not knowing who you was or whe|ther bound; but you &s;aid Mount Zion&mdash;and I was for that; and &s;o we went on, and the fir&s;t thing that ever really &s;tumbled me was, what I &s;aw in the mother at Elijah Wile's, &s;he
<PB N="14" REF="019212_0013_0FAA675035D23A90">look'd very red, and acted to my acceptation, as tho' &s;he had drink'd too hard. This in|deed bro't great di&s;tre&s;s and trouble upon me, and how could it be otherwi&s;e, when I had put my&s;elf into her hands as an infallible guide, tru&s;ting &s;he was perfect; and if &s;o, I thought &s;he could not have any licentious ap|petites. This gave me &s;ome confu&s;ion, but after much trouble and rea&s;oning about it, I endeavoured to put it out of my mind, and hope the be&s;t; but 'ere long I was troubled a|gain with &s;eeing the &s;ame thing in her, and in others of the lead; and about the &s;ame time, many of the brethren being troubled on the &s;ame account, were cha&s;ti&s;ed by the church for fal&s;e judging; and reports of this &s;ort were current about in the world. This indeed gave me &s;ome doubt of your infallibility; and e&s;pecially as I knew the&s;e things were not meer|ly accidental, but common, or at lea&s;t in time grew very common. Yet I did not mean to &s;eperate from you without &s;ufficient light and &s;trength in my own &s;oul, to come off without danger and lo&s;s. It was therefore that I did not, but endured with great trouble and an|gui&s;h of &s;oul what I cannot expre&s;s, for above two years &s;ince I fir&s;t began to complain and open my troubles to you on this account as I had opportunity; but not being convinced that my complaints were cau&s;ele&s;s, nor you that the things I complained off were warrant|able,
<PB N="15" REF="019212_0014_0FAA6750EE00E2D0">and &s;eeing no reformation; but rather an increa&s;e, I felt a gradual decline from you, and it could not be otherwi&s;e, except I could be made &s;en&s;ible that vice was no &s;in; and if &s;o in one thing, why not in all? And though to the pure all things are pure, as you often would plead; yet it is in the temperate u&s;e of them; for temperance is one of the fruits of the &s;pirit, &s;ee Gal. 5 chap. 23 ver&s;e; there|fore, who&s;oever goes into exce&s;&s;ive drinking, is not pure; for nothing more incapacitates or renders them more incapable to &s;erve ei|ther God or man. And if all things were pure to you, why &s;hould &s;uch liberties be ta|ken in &s;ome things even to exce&s;s and &s;ome ab&s;tinence in others even to di&s;tre&s;s. I think God has given me &s;ome under&s;tanding of what is right and what is wrong; therefore if I &s;hould &s;ee any per&s;on that you or I could name intoxicated with liquor repeatedly and from time to time, &s;o that they would &s;tumble in their walk and fumble in their &s;peech with an inflamed countenance, and irregular be|haviour, and you &s;hould tell me that &s;uch an one was the only lead of God &s;et up in the world, to whom all &s;ouls mu&s;t come, and by whom all mu&s;t be &s;aved that are &s;aved, or made perfect of Adam's race, fir&s;t and la&s;t, I could not believe it. I &s;ay I could not believe it; it would be violence upon my&s;elf to attempt to believe it; nor do I think any can believe
<PB N="16" REF="019212_0015_0FAA6751A7D03708">it but only &s;uch as mu&s;t con&s;equently believe that the commands of God are annulled, the bible out of date, and a new mini&s;tration ne|ver before heard of taking place; where all things is in&s;erted, vice is become virtue, and virtue vice. But more particularly at a cer|tain time I went with the church from Har|wood to Wooburn and when we arrived at Nathan Kindale's in that place, the mother and elder William took a private chamber and I &s;uppo&s;e lay down to &s;leep, for they were there I believe &s;ome hours before I could &s;ee them; and at length I went into the chamber and elder William was got up, but he appear|ed to me as if he had been drinking very hard, both by his words and actions. I think the Mother was not got up. But the whole &s;cene was &s;uch as gave me great trouble, and I had afterwards to confe&s;s my jealou&s;y. I know that my troubles were very great on this ac|count at that time. At another time I &s;aw you &s;o much ami&s;s with liquor at William Mories in the town of Norton, you fumbled in your &s;peech and acted very oddly, &s;o that I was exceedingly afraid it would be ob&s;erved by the &s;pectators that were pre&s;ent. Afterward when the church came to A&s;hfield, I think you cannot but remember how many crying &s;pells I had about their hard drinking; and how many times I have been cha&s;ti&s;ed on this ac|count for my fal&s;e-juding the church as they
<PB N="17" REF="019212_0016_0FAA67529A0A4668">called it. At another time I having heard that the mother was drunk at landlord Will|cox's in New-Wind&s;or, on their way from Enfield to New-Providence, my troubles were &s;o hard upon me that I roar'd and cry'd great part of one whole day together, that I was al|mo&s;t down &s;ick; but afterwards, when the church came through the town of Richmond, on their way to Ni&s;queunia, they made &s;ome &s;tay among us, at which time I &s;aw more of it, and that very apparently at Sam. Fitch's, and the widow Goodrich's; but more abun|dantly after they went over into New-Leban|on: e&s;pecially on the day that the mother was carried by authority before <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Grant, there I &s;aw &s;uch a flagrant proof of what I had in part &s;een and &s;o long &s;u&s;pected, that I was now &s;a|tisfied as to this matter. But &s;till &s;ome how or other I did not leave you till I had &s;een much more of it. At Ni&s;queunia one time for &s;e|veral days together I believe the mother was the mo&s;t of the time ami&s;s with liquor; that &s;he would act I thought ridiculou&s;ly odd, and one time when I was there at Ni&s;queunia the mother went over to John Partington's, and &s;he was well for what I knew when &s;he went off; but I heard directly that &s;he was under great &s;ufferings there; and when &s;he return|ed I thought &s;he was quite drunk, and I had a fair ob&s;ervation of her. Now elder James, I appeal to your own con&s;cience&mdash;deny it
<PB N="18" REF="019212_0017_0FAA67535AC82BB0">if you can, and face God in it. And now to clo&s;e this point, I refer you to certain pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, I. Cor. 5&mdash;11, but now I have written to you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, an idolater, a railer, or a drunkard, &amp;c, with &s;uch an one no not to eat. Again, I. Cor. 6&mdash;10, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunk|ards, &amp;c, &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God. And again, Romans 13&mdash;13 let us walk hone&s;t|ly as in the day time; not in rioting and drunkenne&s;s, in chambering and wantonne&s;s, &amp;c. and after this the command of God to me by the Apo&s;tle Paul, II. The&s;&s;. 3 chap. and 6 ver&s;e, now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly, and not after the tradition which ye received of us, ver&s;e 7, for your&s;elves know how ye ought to follow us, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus having made my fir&s;t objection again&s;t your intemperance, which practice is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with both rea&s;on and &s;cripture, and con|&s;equently with the happine&s;s of man both here and hereafter, which is one great and grand cau&s;e of my &s;eparating from you.</P>
<P>I come now to make my &s;econd objection, which is again&s;t your new di&s;pen&s;ation and new mini&s;tration, at the head of which the mother is exalted, and prefered above Chri&s;t, and her apo&s;tles above the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t;
<PB N="19" REF="019212_0018_0FAA6753EABAA110">in which you go contrary to the mini&s;tration of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; and in effect re|nounce the bible, if I can &s;ee the con&s;i&s;tency of things. For I believe you will not deny but that the mother did go by her immediate gifts of vi&s;ions, revelations, and prophe&s;y, as you call them, without any regard to the bible, which I think does produce a mini&s;tration quite different from either that of Mo&s;es or Chri&s;t, as appears by &s;ome &s;hocking in&s;tances, particularly children that were of your com|munity, cur&s;ing their parents that were un|believers, calling them wolves and devils, &amp;c. Again children cha&s;ti&s;ing their parents in very opprobious language that were believers. A|gain men and women, parents and children, dancing &s;tark naked together; as al&s;o, men and women, parents and children going into the creek and &s;wimming together; and again the mother's pounding and beating the private parts of both men and women in her di&s;ci|pline&mdash;the&s;e things have I &s;een and many o|thers that will come in, in their proper places. Now were the&s;e and &s;uch like things are mini|&s;tred, and are e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary parts of the mini&s;tration, I and every body el&s;e that &s;ees and hears &s;uch things, mu&s;t agree that it is &s;ure enough a new mini&s;tration, and whe|ther you would own it or not, it is &s;o, becau&s;e I find no &s;uch things mini&s;tred or commanded in the bible. And now I &s;hall in&s;tance a few
<PB N="20" REF="019212_0019_0FAA6755D7C290B8">of your doctrinal points which you make u&s;e of in &s;upport of your new di&s;pen&s;ation, new apo&s;tles and mini&s;try. Fir&s;t&mdash;It has been of|ten urged among you that the pre&s;ent day is &s;even times greater than that of Chri&s;t's fir&s;t appearance, and con&s;equently the pre&s;ent mini&s;tration is &s;even times greater than that of the apo&s;tles. It was in this view, as I &s;up|po&s;e, that Samuel Fitch &s;aid in my hearing, if I under&s;tood him right, that the mother was &s;even times greater than Chri&s;t. And again, he &s;aid if I remember right, that Chri&s;t had been and gather'd his company, and now mother was gathering her company; and that when Chri&s;t &s;hould hereafter appear with his company, mother would al&s;o appear with her company, making the mother the head of this di&s;pen&s;ation, as Chri&s;t was of that, with the addition of &s;even times greater. Elder Part|ington al&s;o &s;aid in my hearing at the time when the people returned from the mother's funer|al to the hou&s;e that either the mother was, or he believed &s;he was gone to prepare a place for them, and that he believed &s;he was then pre&s;ent and heard every word that was &s;aid. I will al&s;o tran&s;cribe a certain clau&s;e in Wil|liam Scale's letter to me in his own words, wherein he &s;ays, "two of the leading per&s;ons have &s;ealed their te&s;timony with their blood, whereby it is of force." The&s;e are his own words. Now elder James was ever any thing
<PB N="21" REF="019212_0020_0FAA675696DF9740">more ab&s;urd. At another time Jo&s;eph Meech|em told me in an&s;wer to my que&s;tion, that you (viz.) mother and elders were got beyond all that was written; if he denies this article as he &s;eemed to do when I was at church la&s;t, it would de&s;troy all my charity for him. I think the &s;ame has apparently tran&s;pired in your general doctrine in &s;uch like expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, the &s;criptures were good in their day, but nothing to us in this new di&s;pen&s;ation; and would often cha&s;ti&s;e me for believing and holding to what was written in the bible&mdash;calling it letter, and old heavens, and a back di&s;pen&s;ation. Now to &s;peak plain, I think for you who preach &s;uch doctrine and yet often read and expound, and apply &s;cripture, is an incon&s;i&s;tent impo&s;ition upon your&s;elves and others; for what have you to do with letter and old heavens, and a back di&s;pen&s;ation, who are in the new? Now ob&s;erve, where e|ver you are incon&s;i&s;tent you mu&s;t be al&s;o ig|norant and ought to be willing to be taught; for where there is ignorance and incon&s;i&s;ten|cy there is no &s;afety. If you make any u&s;e of the &s;cripture, and they are any thing to your purpo&s;e, how have you got beyond them? And if you are included by them, how is it a new mini&s;tration? For the very gifts you pretend to, as vi&s;ions, revelations, tongues and prophe|&s;y, you quote from &s;cripture to prove your mi&s;&s;ion and mini&s;try by. Pray how then are
<PB N="22" REF="019212_0021_0FAA6756F92A2BA8">you in a new one beyond it? Why will you be here and there both, or &s;omebody no where? Either own the bible and go according to it, or prove its invaldity, and have nothing to do with it; for how can you be in a new &s;even|fold greater day with the &s;ame old apo&s;tolick gifts in a &s;even fold le&s;&s;er degree. Elder James pray look, for I mu&s;t think that if you are con|&s;i&s;tent, I am not a rational creature. But to return, I &s;hall fir&s;t prove by &s;cripture, whether it be any thing to you or not, that there is two, and but two days of di&s;pen&s;ation, which is that of Mo&s;es and Chri&s;t, the law and the go&s;pel which include the two &s;tates of man, (viz.) law and grace, the fir&s;t Adam and the &s;econd Adam &s;tates, and that the&s;e are to be continued to the end of the world, and all mankind are and will be included in the old covenant and the new to the end of time, which two covenants were in the two te&s;timonies or mini&s;trations of Mo&s;es and Chri&s;t; and there is no other, nor ever will be, as I will &s;hew you by &s;cripture, if that proves any thing,&mdash;Fir&s;t with re&s;pect to the perpetuity, if not the eternity of the law, &s;ee Mal. 4&mdash;4, remember ye the law of Mo&s;es my &s;ervant which I com|manded him in Horeb for all I&s;rael, with the &s;tatutes and judgments&mdash;and Chri&s;t in refer|rence to this &s;ame law &s;ays, Matt. 5&mdash;18, for verily I &s;ay unto you, till heaven and earth pa&s;s one jot or one tittle, &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="019212_0022_0FAA6757B1B41348">from the law till all be fulfilled. And St. Paul having treated particularly of ju&s;tificati|on by faith without the deeds of the law, fin|ally concludes, Rom. 3.31, do we then make void the law by faith? God forbid, yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the law. By what I have already quoted it appears that the prophet Malachi, confirms the law, at lea&s;t throughout the Jew|i&s;h oeconomy, and Paul confirms it through|out the apo&s;tolick day; and Chri&s;t confirms it till the heavens and earth be no more. And now with re&s;pect to the go&s;pel, according to the te&s;timony already given by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles: as to its duration and continuance, Chri&s;t &s;ays, Matt. 24&mdash;14 and this (not ano|ther) go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached for a witne&s;s unto all nations, and then &s;hall the end come. Again, Matt. 28&mdash;20 teach|ing them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you (mark I have command|ed you) and lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world, Amen. And Paul I think allows of no other mini&s;tration but the law and go&s;pel to the end of time. See Rom. 2&mdash;16, in the day when God &s;hall judge the &s;ecrets of men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to my go&s;pel. Read a few ver&s;es foregoing in this pa&s;&s;age la&s;t quoted, wherein you may &s;ee that the law as well as go&s;pel is that by which men will be judged in the great day. And al&s;o with re&s;pect to the continuance of
<PB N="24" REF="019212_0023_0FAA67586FA284E0">the apo&s;tolick mini&s;tration, you may &s;ee I: Peter 1&mdash;25, but the word of the Lord endur|eth forever; and this is the word which by the go&s;pel is preached unto you. And that you may al&s;o &s;ee that there is no allowance for any other mini&s;tration but that of the apo&s;tolick according to their te&s;timony in that day, &s;ee Gal. 1&mdash;8, but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other go&s;pel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accurs'd. And in the 9th ver&s;e he &s;ays, if any man preach any other go&s;pel, &amp;c. I think what I have already laid down is &s;ufficient to prove that there is but two te&s;timonies, and two mini&s;trations, that of Mo&s;es and Chri&s;t, which are the two witne&s;&s;es, or the two te&s;ta|tors, who have dedicated their te&s;timony with blood, as you may find in the 9th of He|brews, and indeed in that whole epi&s;tle at large. What then could William Scales mean when he &s;aid that two of the leading per&s;ons had &s;ealed their te&s;timony with their blood, whereby it is of force? which if it be &s;o, yours mu&s;t be a third te&s;tament and mini&s;tration, and con&s;equently a third covenant, which annuls the &s;econd or new covenant &s;poken of in 8th of Hebrew. Now elder James, dare you or any of you &s;ay, that there is or ever will be more than the&s;e two covenants? But if you have got a te&s;tament or a mini&s;tration that is not contained in that new covenant mini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="25" REF="019212_0024_0FAA67592F2C1C60">&s;poken of in the 8th chap. of Hebrews, it mu&s;t be another, whatever it be, then what will you call it, and where will you place it? and it is evident that you do think you are in a new day and di&s;pensation; becau&s;e you call all that is written a back di&s;pen&s;ation and old heavens; and even if it were as you &s;uppo&s;e that you were in the new heavens, that al&s;o is contained in what you call a back di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;ee I&s;aiah 65&mdash;17 and on, compared with Re|velations 21&s;t chap. &amp;c, wherein the particu|lar &s;tate and circum&s;tance of the new heavens and earth, with tho&s;e that dwell in them is mi|ni&s;tred and given by the prophet I&s;aiah and John the revelator both, for it is what they te&s;tified and yet is contained in what you call a back di&s;pen&s;ation and old heavens; but if you &s;hould &s;ay that you have entered into what they &s;aid &s;hould take place, it would at once de&s;troy the very idea of your new di&s;pen&s;ati|on and mini&s;try, where the mother is the head gathering her company according to Samuel Fitch's doctrine, as recited above and you the apo&s;tles; and on the other hand, if it be as elder Partington &s;aid, that the mother was gone to prepare a place for them, that al&s;o as effectually de&s;troys the very idea of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion and mini&s;try for that end according to what is written in the bible; e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to us in this day, then &s;urely we have done with the bible, and mu&s;t depend wholly
<PB N="26" REF="019212_0025_0FAA675A2565AB60">upon the mother, who&s;e mini&s;tration does produce what is not contained in the bible. Now I de&s;ire you to ob&s;erve that if it be as you &s;ay, that this is a new day and di&s;pen&s;ati|on, of which the mother is the fir&s;t born, and con&s;equently the head or lead; then &s;he &s;tands in this day and di&s;pen&s;ation to us, ju&s;t as Chri&s;t did in that day and di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, according to what is written, where Chri&s;t was the fir&s;t born, among many brethren, and con|&s;equently the head and lead to them; and as he was Chri&s;t and a Saviour to them, &s;o is the Mother Chri&s;t, and a Saviour to us, for Sam. Fitch told me that he had no Chri&s;t to look to but the mother, and as Chri&s;t had a new te&s;tament and died for them in that day, &s;o the mother has a new te&s;tament, and died for us in this day&mdash;for this is what you pretend, and as Chri&s;t &s;ealed his te&s;timony with his blood whereby it is of force, &s;o has the mother &s;ealed her te&s;timony with her blood, whereby it is of force, according to William Scale's. And as Chri&s;t's death and &s;ufferings was mer|ritorious for their &s;alvation in that day, &s;o is the mother's death and &s;ufferings merritorious for our &s;alvation in this day; and as they in that day were to obey Chri&s;t's mini&s;try, &s;o we mu&s;t obey the mother's mini&s;try in this day; and as it is &s;aid in Zachariah 12th chap. they &s;hall look upon Chri&s;t whom they have pierced and mourn, and be in bitterne&s;s, &amp;c.
<PB N="27" REF="019212_0026_0FAA675C19F79928">even &s;o we in this day &s;hall look upon the mother whom we have pierced and mourn, and be in bitterne&s;s; as I once heard Samuel Fitch hold forth in his doctrine; and as it was expedient for Chri&s;t to go away&mdash;and he was gone to prepare a place for his followers, even &s;o it was expedient for the mother to go away, and &s;he was gone to prepare a place for her followers, according to what elder Part|ington &s;aid; and as Chri&s;t was pre&s;ent with his followers by his &s;pirit in that day, &s;o is the mother pre&s;ent with her followers by her &s;pir|it in this day, mini&s;tring gifts to them. Now elder James is not this another Chri&s;t in imi|tation of that we read of; and is not what &s;he mini&s;ters quite another go&s;pel&mdash;if you call it go&s;pel? and does not this entirely &s;et a&s;ide the bible as a thing out of date? and put your te&s;timony in its place? and does not this &s;et Chri&s;t a&s;ide, and put the mother in his place, with the appellation of &s;even fold greater? and do you not take great pains to era&s;e every idea of God and Chri&s;t out of the minds of your people, but only what dwells in the mo|ther and the elders? and to deface and era&s;e the very remembrance of that old letter, call|ed &s;cripture, &s;aying you have got the &s;pirit. And are you not therefore incon&s;i&s;tent to med|dle at all with the bible, except you could prove by it, its own invalidity and di&s;&s;olution? for elder James you mu&s;t know, it would be ab|&s;urd
<PB N="28" REF="019212_0027_0FAA675C3B807BA0">to &s;uppo&s;e, that a new day and di&s;pen&s;ati|on could take place but at the end and expira|tion of the former; therefore if you do really believe that you are entered into a new day and di&s;pen&s;ation, as you &s;ay you have, you mu&s;t know of con&s;equence that whatever im|provements you have made from the bible was a grand impo&s;ition; and if you make any u&s;e of &s;cripture you bring it into force, and will overthrow the mother, e&s;pecially if her mini&s;try and that of her apo&s;tles differ from that of Chri&s;t's and his apo&s;tles&mdash;which is the next thing to be attended to.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t's go&s;pel &s;ays, I. Timothy, 2&mdash;12, but I &s;uffer not a woman to teach nor to u&s;urp authority over the man; but to be in &s;ilence: but the mother's te&s;ti|mony &s;ays the contrary, and takes unlimited authority upon her&s;elf; even to ordering, dic|tating, &s;tripping and whipping both men and women. Now can any creature &s;uppo&s;e that God will be with and own any one in the breach of his commands? What have you elder James to vindicate this point but the di&s;annuling of the commandment? and that cannot be done without breaking with the whole book, and the author of it too. This proves your new di&s;pen&s;ation: but if the commands of God &s;tand, it will overthrow your whole &s;y&s;tem, and you with it. I think it is entirely needle&s;s to undertake to prove, that the woman
<PB N="29" REF="019212_0028_0FAA675D4ED27AB8">&s;poken of in the 12th chap. of Rev. and al&s;o that in Jeremiah 31&mdash;22, and that again in the 45th P&s;alm, from the 10th ver&s;e and on. May none of them be applied to the mother, as you pretend, becau&s;e &s;he is at the head of the great and la&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation, far enough be|yond all them, they being in the former, and this pretence &s;aves me the labour, and proves &s;he is not. And be&s;ides that in the Rev. and in the P&s;alms was undoubtedly a figurative de&s;cription of the church, and that in Jere|miah, a prophe&s;y of Chri&s;t's nativity, with a hint at the manner of it. But to proceed to another particular, Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel &s;ays, Mat|thew 15&mdash;4, for God commanded &s;aying, ho|nor thy father and mother; and he that cur&s;|eth father or mother, let him die the death&mdash;the&s;e are Chri&s;t's own words, and every awa|kened and enlightened con&s;cience mu&s;t know and feel that there is a moral rectitude in them and his obligations to obey them as the com|mand of God, both in his law and go&s;pel too; but it is certain that under the mother's mi|ni&s;try I have heard children cur&s;e their par|ents&mdash;and it was appointed in the church, and I take it to be a criterion in your &s;y&s;tem to cut off all natural affection by the highe&s;t provocation; and al&s;o under the mother's mini&s;try, children do di&s;honor their parents I know, for I &s;aw a young man of your com|pany order his father to &s;trip in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="30" REF="019212_0029_0FAA675E272F43E8">a large room full of people both men and wo|men, then &s;eizing him by his private mem|bers, hauling him this way and that by them, cha&s;tizing him aloud for his old heavens and lu&s;t, and then taking him up and &s;etting him upon his head and &s;houlders, heels upwards, then by force wrenching his naked thighs a|part and taking him again by his members, and handling them in the view of all pre&s;ent, every way expo&s;ing his father to the utmo&s;t &s;hame. Was not this di&s;honoring his parent, elder James, and breaking the command of God? the mother being pre&s;ent and the mov|er of it: when Chri&s;t expre&s;sly &s;ays, Matt. 5&mdash;19, who&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commands, and teach men &s;o, &s;hall be called lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven. But who&s;oever &s;hall do, and teach them, &s;hall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Is not here a material difference in the two mi|ni&s;trations, and the one tending directly to the de&s;truction of the other? but you will &s;ay that Chri&s;t is come in the mother, and it is he that does it; but will Chri&s;t contradict or counteract his own word? or will he tell the mother to do what he forbids? for when God commanded children to honour their father and mother, would Chri&s;t in the mother &s;et this young man to di&s;honor his father, as relat|ed above? Does not &s;uch a doctrine tend to the aboli&s;hing of the &s;criptures, and opening
<PB N="31" REF="019212_0030_0FAA675E6F487248">an uninterrupted way to the mother's mini|&s;try? but here ob&s;erve, that although Chri&s;t &s;ays, Matt. 10&mdash;35, for I am come to &s;et a man at variance again&s;t his father, and the daugh|ter again&s;t her mother, and the daughter-in law again&s;t her mother-in-law, &amp;c. and this being the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence or effect of the go&s;pel, to &s;et at variance and &s;eparate them that believe from them that believe not; yet &s;o far is the believer from cur&s;ing his father or mother, or any body el&s;e, that he will ble&s;s and cur&s;e not: yea he will ble&s;s them that cur&s;e him, and do good to them that hate him, and per&s;ecute him according to the commands of Chri&s;t, &s;ee Matt. &mdash;44; and &s;o far is he from di&s;honouring his parents by any abu&s;ive language or behaviour, that he honours and obeys them, according to go&s;pel command. In Col. 3&mdash;20, children obey your parents in all things, for this is well plea&s;ing to the Lord; but wherever the &s;on di&s;honours the father the character is bad, as you may &s;ee, Micah 7&mdash;6 and wherever children di&s;obey their parents, their character is bad, as you may &s;ee, Rom. 1&mdash;30, and II. Tim. 3&mdash;2, this is what we read in the &s;criptures; but under the mother's mini&s;try I have &s;een and known the greate&s;t of what men would call abu&s;ive treatment of children to their parents, I think that ever I heard of, and all under a pretence of religion
<PB N="32" REF="019212_0031_0FAA675F2BA9F2B0">and freeing their &s;ouls. Di&s;honouring and di&s;obeying parents is a plain and open breach of the commands of God, according to what is written; and if your mini&s;try leads into the&s;e things it mu&s;t be ANTE, or again&s;t, let the pretence be what it will; except it be as you &s;ay a new di&s;pen&s;ation, where there is no God, nor Chri&s;t, nor bible, but what is in the mother, that can do us any good; then I &s;ay you have no bu&s;ine&s;s with the bible, and ought not to impo&s;e upon people with it, nor do I think you would if they were able to bear it; but where as I am in full belief of the &s;criptures&mdash;thanks to God for it. I mean to contend earne&s;tly for the faith which was once delivered to the &s;aints. Again we read I. Cor. 6&mdash;10, nor revilers &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God. Again I. Cor. 5&mdash;11, nor a railer with &s;uch an one no not to eat. And again James 4&mdash;11 &s;peak not evil one of ano|ther brethren, for he that &s;peaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, &s;peaketh e|vil of the law, and judgeth the law, &amp;c. I could quote many texts of &s;cripture, from the old and new te&s;tament to the &s;ame effect, whereby it appears that railing, reviling, and evil &s;peaking is contrary to the nature and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which te&s;tifies that &s;uch &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore, whoever allows them&s;elves in the&s;e things, pretend what they will, they are di&s;|owned
<PB N="33" REF="019212_0032_0FAA675FE779E948">of God; and what can tend more to de&s;troy people's morals; and is it not the re|ver&s;e of a meek and quiet &s;pirit; and does it not belong to another kingdom? For Chri&s;t when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he was per&s;ecuted, he threatened not, but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth right. And Paul &s;ays, being reviled we ble&s;s; being defamed we entreat; being per&s;ecuted we &s;uffer it: but it is not to be marvelled at if another mini&s;tration produces other things for &s;uch as is the tree, &s;uch the fruit will be. And James &s;ays, out of the &s;ame mouth proceed|eth ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing, (and &s;o it is with you) my brethren the&s;e things ought not to be &s;o. Again, Paul to Timothy &s;ays, the &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle towards all men? apt to teach, patient, in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing them that oppo&s;e them&s;elves &amp;c. but you do &s;trive. Again, Paul to the Ephe|&s;ians &s;ays, let all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil &s;peaking be put away from you, with all malice, and be kind one to another&mdash;tender hearted, forgiving one another even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven you. Now Elder James this &s;eems to be the nature and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel;&mdash;therefore I am bold to &s;ay, that there can be no drunkard, no cur&s;er of parents, no di&s;hor|orer of parents, no di&s;obedient to parents, and &s;uch like can be found in Chri&s;t's go&s;pel; and
<PB N="34" REF="019212_0033_0FAA67619E419718">if you have any &s;uch in yours, then it mu&s;t be another. Elder James I hone&s;tly tell you, that I have &s;pared you in relation to railing, fearing you was not able to bear a true decla|ration of facts without offence: I have kept back the words and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the ideas that offered them&s;elves to give it its own complec|tion, and lea&s;t I &s;hould be a railer too. But if an hone&s;t recital of facts &s;hould offend you, I &s;hould think that you was not good; or that the things acted were not good, and you were a&s;hamed of them, and ought to confe&s;s and &s;uppre&s;s them; for if you knew how &s;ome of your people treats my character, if you had any &s;en&s;e of humanity, you would be a&s;hamed of them, and if you had any &s;en&s;e of chri&s;|tianity you would be &s;orry for them, and take unwearied pains to teach them better; which I think you mu&s;t do, except you as well as they are &s;o lo&s;t from God as to act that out, that may in time convince every body, and prove the ab&s;urdity of your new mini&s;try. I &s;peak this not that it annoys me; but that by plain facts and fair rea&s;on and &s;cripture, you might be convicted; and be&s;ides this, to my own ma&s;ter I &s;tand or fall: or even allowing that I was in fault, I think you ought to have taken the go&s;pel rule, Gal. 6&mdash;1, brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are &s;piritual, re&s;tore &s;uch an one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con&s;idering your&s;elf le&s;t you al&s;o

I am &s;en&s;ible, that it is a received opinion among you, that to come out with great wrath and anger in te&s;timony again&s;t what you call &s;in is right; but is not wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil &s;peaking &s;in it&s;elf? el&s;e why is it for|bidden? &s;ee Eph. 4&mdash;31&mdash;again, Titus 3&mdash;2 to &s;peak evil of no man; to be no brawlers, but gentle, &s;hewing all meekne&s;s unto all men: then to rail and exclaim, and fal&s;ely accu&s;e &amp; that in anger too, is again&s;t the commands of God and therefore &s;in; from which I &s;ee no e&s;cape but by repentance and faith in Chri&s;t, except by taking refuge in a new di&s;pen&s;ation would do. I know that part of Paul's charge to Timothy and Titus, was to reprove and re|buke; but that was by preaching the word, which carries reproof and rebuke in it to tho&s;e that &s;in; but I am far from believing that either of them, in obeying Paul's charge, ever conducted as many of you do, for it mu&s;t be done in meekne&s;s, without bitterne&s;s, anger, wrath, clamour, or evil &s;peaking, &amp;c. Is go|ing into &s;in the way out of it?</P>
<P>Another point to be examined is, whether your mother's character agrees with that giv|en by St. Paul, Titus 1&s;t chap. wherein he &s;ays, if any man be blamele&s;s, the hu&s;band of one wi&s;e, having faithful children, not accu&s;ed of riot, or unruly. For a bi&s;hop mu&s;t be
<PB N="36" REF="019212_0035_0FAA6762ECD7E390">blamele&s;s as the &s;teward of God, not &s;elf-will|ed, not &s;oon angry, not given to wine, no &s;triker, not given to filthy lucre, &amp;c. Mark, he &s;ays, if any be blamele&s;s, which he could not be if he were found in the breach of any one rule given in this character&mdash;the hu&s;band of one wife; but your mother was no hu&s;band nor did &s;he allow of any hu&s;band, or wife at all, and them that were &s;uch &s;he would part them forever, if they would be of her com|munity; and certainly they were accu&s;ed of riot, and of being very unruly, for they will many of them drink hard, &s;ing and dance all night, &s;trip naked and &s;pank one anothers ar&s;|es, and make as much noi&s;e as they can among them&s;elves, and to tho&s;e that are oppo&s;ed to them, they will judge and condemn, and &s;en|tence to hell with the mo&s;t dreadful oaths &amp; cur&s;es; calling them boogers, devils and Sod|omites; be&s;ides pu&s;hing, hunching, pulling hair, &s;triking, biting, and &s;pitting in their faces&mdash;&s;ee the widow Goodrich in particu|lar, and the others almo&s;t as bad, in the mo&s;t angry, venemous manner I think that ever I &s;ee any where in any ca&s;e. Mark I don't mean that this is the ca&s;e at all times; for there is at &s;ometimes the greate&s;t appearance of love and meekne&s;s. And as to the mother's be|ing &s;elf-willed, I would mention one in&s;tance and let that &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent: as you will likely remember when the church as you
<PB N="37" REF="019212_0036_0FAA6763C9BA3048">call them was at Elijah Slo&s;on's, a great num|ber of people being gathered, you began your doctrine and the people being inqui&s;itive and de&s;irous to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions, you would not allow of it, but &s;aid to them that when you &amp; your brethren, viz. the &s;peakers had done, they &s;hould have their opportunity and be fairly heard and an&s;wered; at which they gave audience and kept good order 'till you had all got through. Then your mother &s;lipped into the hou&s;e (for this was out of doors) and &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger immediately to call you in, but you lingering a little, &s;he &s;ent another ex|pre&s;s for you and the re&s;t of the elders, at which you went in; then &s;he took you up &s;tairs in|to a chamber and cha&s;ti&s;ed you for di&s;obedi|ence&mdash;I being pre&s;ent and an eye and ear wit|ne&s;s to the whole. The people were offended at their di&s;appointment, and William Baker, a young man partly believing in that way fell off for this thing. In this &s;he would have her way, and force you to break your agreement. Again, &s;he was very often very angry, and much given to wine and &s;trong drink, and certainly &s;he was a &s;triker, both of me and many others. And as to her being given to, or greedy of filthy lucre, let her pretence be what it would, this is certain, &s;he did require that we &s;hould re&s;ign up all we had to her di&s;|po&s;al. Now elder James I leave to you judge, whether your mother's character agrees with
<PB N="38" REF="019212_0037_0FAA676468DFAB38">that given by St. Paul. But perhaps you will &s;ay, that your mother was not a bi&s;hop, but the fir&s;t and great apo&s;tle of a new di&s;pen&s;ation, and you the bi&s;hop. Well, will that help the matter as to character. Will a drunkard, a railer, a &s;elf-willed angry &s;triker, and one that demands all I have, and will ever prepare war again&s;t us, if their be any he&s;itation about it? I &s;ay, will &s;uch an one do, being a woman too, for the great apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop, or the Chri&s;t of your new di&s;pen&s;ation? for you do &s;ay, or at lea&s;t you have &s;aid, that there is no God, nor Chri&s;t but what was in your mother, and you her elders; nor no &s;alvation but by her; and this pretence of a new day and di&s;|pen&s;ation is a hand&s;ome covering for all, and well accounts for the many unaccountable things produced by her mini&s;try, and for the mother's appearing in &s;o different a character from that given by St. Paul. Now elder James if you would but rationally attend to what has been already &s;aid, you mu&s;t be convinced that you have not the characters of chri&s;tians ac|cording to any thing we find in &s;cripture.&mdash;Therefore, if you make a pretence of being the people of God, you had better tell every one hone&s;tly, as you do the &s;trong believers among you, that you are got clear beyond all that is written in the bible, and let people know who and what you be before you take them and put out their eyes, and &s;et them a

To be &s;ure &s;he does much at &s;triking with &s;ticks, and biting, and &s;pitting in the face I believe, for I have &s;een the wounds that was &s;aid &s;he gave: and is &s;he not therefore according to your own doctrine the &s;eed of Cain that killed his brother with a &s;tick? Be&s;ides many others I could name, that by the accounts are not much if any thing behind her in acts of out|rage
<PB N="41" REF="019212_0040_0FAA6766AB4CEE30">and violence; and yet I have no doubt but the poor creatures verily think they do God &s;ervice. O! how much blood has been &s;hed by this religious anger &s;ince the founda|tion of the world; and this is certainly the effect of your new mini&s;tration; and be&s;ides all this Elder James, I have been many times burdened at your hypocri&s;y and deceit, deny|ing at one time what you &s;aid at another: par|ticularly once at Elias Brown's, in Pre&s;ton, when we left Stonington on our way to Wind|lsam, they que&s;tioned you of things that I knew was among you, and you would not own it. I thought then if I remember right, they would likely &s;oon be certified of the mat|ter, and report, that you had lied about it. I have many times ob&s;erved &s;uch things in you that has given me great trouble. Al&s;o, your mother &s;aid one time in my hearing, that Ames Rathbun had never brought any thing and given to the church, when I knew the con|trary. At another time when &s;ome of tho&s;e you call the world &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect and ac|cuse her of taking money of her people, &s;he plumply denied it, when I ab&s;olutely knew that &s;he had taken of me both &s;ilver and gold, and I knew that &s;he knew it, for &s;he would &s;peak of it at other times in commendation of me, I &s;uppo&s;ed for an example to others. At another time at A&s;hfield, in the ca&s;e between I&s;aac Chancy and Talmage Bi&s;hop, and &s;ome
<PB N="42" REF="019212_0041_0FAA67676C495760">others that were entangled in the &s;ame affair, it came before her for deci&s;ion, and after &s;he had been &s;ome time upon the matter, &s;he came out with reproofs again&s;t them, and then made an appeal to me, meaning as I &s;uppo&s;ed, that I &s;hould join with her, and come out &s;harp again&s;t them al&s;o; I knowing her mind and my own ignorance of the matter, was &s;treight|ened in my&s;elf what to do, at length come out in &s;uch terms as I thought I might with a good con&s;cience; but it not an&s;wering her mind &s;he came right upon me with cha&s;ti&s;ement, I thought becau&s;e I would not tell a lie. And many times in her appeals to me&mdash;in her di&s;|cipline upon others, I have been &s;o afraid, I think I may &s;ay, that I &s;hould bring her upon me like a lion, if Ii did not even wrong my con&s;cience in joining with her, as would bring me to great &s;treights in my mind; and this I &s;uppo&s;e from my ob&s;ervation of others, that they think it to be perfectly agreeable to God's will to &s;ay as you do at a venture, you being their God or guide, if they can plea&s;e you they feel well enough; but I ws afraid to tru&s;t it, for I did believe, and do &s;till, that there was another God beyond you that I was an&s;|werable to. One time elder John Partington cha&s;ti&s;ed me, thumping upon me becau&s;e when the world, as you call them, told me of your mother's getting drunk, I did not deny it, and came out again&s;t them with a &s;harp &s;word for
<PB N="43" REF="019212_0042_0FAA67692F30D368">fal&s;ely accu&s;ing the people of God. Elder William has al&s;o cha&s;ti&s;ed me for the &s;ame thing, &s;aying I lo&s;t my faith and confidence for not being more bold and zealous to de|fend the people of God, when indeed I knew that what they &s;aid, and much more was true, and I could not deny it without lying again&s;t my own con&s;cience. Elder William has of|ten forced me, and others to &s;ay I will or I will not do this and that, when I fear'd to do it le&s;t I &s;hould not be able to perform. Now elder James was not this making us liars; and great pains has been taken al&s;o, to make us railers. Children often called up to tell the wor&s;t things they could about their parents and friends in open a&s;&s;emblies, and to berate them to the la&s;t degree, rendering them as ridiculous and odious as devils, even calling them &s;uch; and tho&s;e that &s;ignalized them|&s;elves mo&s;t in this manner, were highe&s;t e&s;teem|ed in the church. I my&s;elf have been reprov|ed, and I thought de&s;pi&s;ed for not doing more in this line than my con&s;cience would allow of. Many have gone &s;o far in raillery as fal&s;e|ly to accu&s;e, and when convicted of their mi&s;|take, they would twi&s;t out, &s;aying, it was in a &s;inful nature to do all the&s;e things, and there|fore guilty of the nature if not the actions. I have al&s;o &s;een &s;uch a lead given to exce&s;&s;ive drinking, that I could not go with it without &s;acrificing or violating my con&s;cience; and
<PB N="44" REF="019212_0043_0FAA6769F3970FD0">therefore it was that I complained to you &s;o much about it. I think it is very evident that your people in general are become great drink|ers&mdash;and that from your examples; for if you did not do it your&s;elves, they would not dare to do it. I have certainly &s;een and, heard com|plaints from others, of your often-being, be|&s;ide your&s;elves; e&s;pecially when you rode a|broad. One time you and elder William, and George Darrow, came in to John Spires, I being there, and George &s;melt and acted as if he was full of rum up to his gullet, and the re&s;t of you not much behind him. I remem|ber this &s;ame George was cha&s;ti&s;ed &s;harply at A&s;hfield for covetou&s;ne&s;s by the church when they were there; but afterwards becoming very liberal and free with liquor to your mo|ther and the elders, and partaking of it with you him&s;elf, he &s;oon became a great favorite of the church, while I &s;unk into contempt for my unea&s;ine&s;s and complaints again&s;t &s;uch practi&s;es. You may likely remember a cer|tain time when you and elder William came to my hou&s;e from Barrington, in Court time, elder William fumbled in his &s;peech and tum|bled about, and &s;pewed on the floor, and was hurried away to bed under a pretence of great &s;ufferings. I did not &s;ee this at this time, be|ing from home; but was informed of it by my wife, who &s;ays &s;he &s;aw it. I &s;aw Knap's wife come to the church in a &s;leigh, I being
<PB N="45" REF="019212_0044_0FAA676A6B03B418">there, that &s;he could &s;carce get into the hou&s;e, being apparently to my exception almo&s;t drunk; and elder William received her with great joy, comforting and &s;trengthening her, without the lea&s;t reproof that I know of, either then or afterwards for it. She appeared to me to be then as full of what you call the power of God, as ever, and would keep for &s;ome time hallowing out aloud, as her u&s;ual manner was, and elder Williams laughing and rejoicing, as it &s;eem'd, to &s;ee her keep &s;o alive in religion, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, he would have us all think, when I knew and could not but think that every one that &s;aw her mu&s;t know that &s;he had more rum religion than any other at that time, except &s;uch as had a great &s;hare of the &s;ame them&s;elves. Now elder James the&s;e and &s;uch like things were certainly the cau&s;e and rea&s;on of my &s;eparating from you, ac|cording to the command of God in II. Cor. 6&mdash;17, wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye &s;eperate faith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. And it is evident to me that your lead was unclean, and out from all bible rules and commands, into &s;uch a diver&s;ity of enormities which I have &s;een and heard, and know to be among you; and I &s;olemnly declare that I do believe accoding to my ob&s;ervations of things among&s;t you, that tho&s;e that are the deepe&s;t in tho&s;e what I call vices and abominations as
<PB N="46" REF="019212_0045_0FAA676B2FBA71E0">related above are the highe&s;t in the e&s;teem and favour of you and your church. I have more to &s;ay, but &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e objections by a re|ferrence to the 28th of I&s;aiah, at the beginning, wo to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, who&s;e glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat val|lies of them that are overcome with wine. Be|hold the Lord hath a mighty and &s;trong one, which as a tempe&s;t of hail and a de&s;troying &s;torns, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing &s;hall ca&s;t down to the earth with the hand, the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim &s;hall be troden under feet. Wherefore I advi&s;e you to tell your poor infatuated company, that you have been deceiving them; and while you have been promi&s;ing them liberty, you your&s;elf have been a &s;ervant of corruption lea&s;t this woe be upon you, all which incon|&s;i&s;tencies and ab&s;urdities &s;eems to be the real and nece&s;&s;ary production of your new di&s;pen|&s;ation and mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Now elder James, omiting many things that might ju&s;tly come under con&s;ideration for a further demon&s;tration of the fal&s;ehood of your pretences, I proceed to make a compari&s;on, between you and the Papi&s;t.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they hold that the Pope is the &s;upreme head of the church, and you hold that the mother was, while living, and now you are &s;upreme head of your church, for you &s;ay
<PB N="47" REF="019212_0046_0FAA676BEBA62220">Chri&s;t came in you, and Chri&s;t and his people are one; and this is the idea you give us, that when you &s;peak to us Chri&s;t &s;peaks to us, for their is no other Chri&s;t. Again, you are as ab&s;olute and de&s;potick as the Pope, and are as arbitrary in your di&s;cipline, and hold your|&s;elf as infallible as he. Herein you agree only being two different communions; one or both is mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting, that no body can be &s;aved out of your communion. He &s;ays this of his, and you of yours. However I think this to be very ridiculous for either, except your characters were better. The Pa|pi&s;ts hold to Purgatory, and &s;o do you, and in the &s;ame manner, both with re&s;pect to their going in and coming out; and for what end? they wor&s;hip their dead &s;aint, and &s;o do you, and pray to them, &s;ing ver&s;es, &s;erenade, and celebrate your mother and father William as you call them. This I have &s;een and heard, among &s;uch as were of your communion, and you your&s;elf bid me confe&s;s to your mother, after &s;he was dead, the la&s;t time I vi&s;ited you at Ni&s;queuniah. Now is not praying and con|fe&s;&s;ing to the dead an un&s;criptural as well as an irrational thing? and what warrant have we for it but your hold a&s;&s;ertions? except it be that &s;cripture in the 8th of I&s;aiah, 19th ver&s;e, and when they &s;hall &s;ay unto you, &s;eek unto them that have familiar &s;pirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, &s;hould not
<PB N="48" REF="019212_0047_0FAA676CAEF98EF8">a people &s;eek unto their God? for the living to the dead; to which I &s;hall &s;peak more particularly in its proper place. Now the Papi&s;ts pretend to prove the doctrine of pur|gatory by their apoaritions and revelations, &s;o do you. The Papi&s;ts make confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins to the Pope and a great number of father confe&s;&s;ors under him, and &s;o do you in your order; and the Pope and father confe&s;|&s;ors pretend a power to ab&s;olve or forgive &s;ins, and &s;o do you; they make the penitents kneel in confe&s;&s;ion before the fathers, and &s;o do you; they admini&s;ter corporal puni&s;hment in their di&s;cipline, and enjoy repentance, and &s;o do you; the penitent after confe&s;&s;ion, ki&s;s|es the fathers hand, or &s;leeve if there is favor, and &s;o it is among you. They have their convents and nunneries for men and women, who are exempted from marriage, and &s;o it is among you, only not in &s;o popular a manner for want of ability. They have their inqui&s;i|tion, and &s;o have you in every idea of it, I think &s;o far as you can go, without the civil authority; and again&s;t tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from them, their excommunications, cur&s;es, invec|tives, and imprecations are the &s;ame of yours, for what I can &s;ee, and their hatred and aver|&s;ion again&s;t all but their own &s;ect, is the &s;ame of yours; they pretend to the gifts of healing and ca&s;ting out devils: of apparitions, reve|velations and prophe&s;y&mdash;if the accounts be
<PB N="49" REF="019212_0048_0FAA676D6A371548">true, in a greater degree perhaps than ever yet you pretended. The Papi&s;t will &s;end a father confe&s;&s;or into a family to take the lead and government of it, who becomes ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and has the controul of the whole family, both parents and children and &s;he ordering and di&s;po&s;ition of them, as we are informed by the author of the book entiled the ma&s;ter key to Popery, and I think the &s;ame is in practice among you. See Aa|ron Williams at Nathan Kindal's, in Woobon, Rufus Cog&s;well at Jo&s;hua Burtch's in Ston|ington, Benjamin Ellis at Jo&s;eph Bennets at New-Providence, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the many fa|ther confe&s;&s;ors that make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to travel about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e to take the confe&s;&s;ions and give their in&s;tructions and orders to families: Such as Ebenezer Cooley, I&s;rael Chancey, Jo&s;eph Meechem, Jo&s;hua Cog&s;well, and many others, for all which &s;er|vices the Papi&s;ts make great demands upon their people; but I think you go clear beyond them, for you require all that they have, even their whole e&s;tates, and their per&s;ons and fa|milies too, to be entirely at your di&s;po&s;al, tell|ing them that &s;hort of this, they will leave their &s;ouls and &s;oterrifying the poor infatuates to a compliance rather than go to holl. The Papi&s;ts and you too as I under&s;tand hold, that every &s;oul has to &s;uffer either here or hereaf|ter for all their &s;in, and yet you have power
<PB N="50" REF="019212_0049_0FAA676E2B0F50C0">to remit them. How incon&s;i&s;tent that is: but of this more hereafter. It is &s;aid that a|mong the Papi&s;ts many of the prie&s;ts of pure lives a&s;&s;ert, that they have &s;een the little boy Je&s;us in the con&s;ecrated ho&s;t, ju&s;t as I have heard Amos Rathbun a&s;&s;ert, that he has &s;een Je&s;us Chri&s;t like a little boy in James Whit|tacor. I under&s;tand by vi&s;ion or apparition, both they and you pretend to the power of miracles; but very few if any are manife&s;t, or believed; but among your&s;elves, which if it were true, is no more than what we read of the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet in three pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in the Revelations. I read of one among the Papi&s;ts that a&s;&s;erted &s;he had &s;ever|al times &s;een Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that he had talked with her. At another time &s;he &s;aw the Holy Trinity. And Jo&s;eph Meechem among you told me that John Partington, one of your elders, had often &s;een Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and al&s;o the prophet Daniel, and I think talked with them. Another article is, that the Papi&s;ts have their &s;econdary mediators, &s;uch as the virgin Mary, St. Peter, St. Paul, and a great number of their eminent &s;aints be&s;ides, who are dead, whom they wor&s;hip and pray to, de&s;iring them to pray and intercede with Chri&s;t for them; and this is a known profe&s;&s;ed principle among you. Even Jo&s;eph Meechem told me, and I have often heard it talkt among you, that God would not hear us but by &s;econdary mediators
<PB N="51" REF="019212_0050_0FAA676EF45EC0E8">under Chri&s;t; and that we could not be &s;aved, but by the mother's interce&s;&s;ion. And in|deed I have heard her pray'd to many times &s;ince &s;he was dead: this is therefore another Popi&s;h tenet. Again both their and your puni&s;hing the particular part that &s;in'd in your di&s;cipline, &amp;c. Again, the Pope and Prie&s;ts among the Papi&s;ts do not allow the common people the liberty of reading the bible; and hold forth that the people ought to obey them blindly in every thing without he&s;itation; and I know this to be the ca&s;e among you, for great efforts have been made to beat me and others off from reading the bible. I remem|ber Samuel Fitch one time came forth with this doctrine, that we ought to believe and obey whatever came from the mother, if we did not &s;ee the rea&s;on and propriety of it; and that we had no right to que&s;tion or doubt of the truth of what the mother &s;aid or did&mdash;this is as nearly his words as I can repeat them, and exactly the &s;en&s;e as I receive it: to which I then took an exception, and ventured to &s;ay to Jo&s;eph Meechem, that Fitch's doc|trine deprived me of &s;eeing and knowing for my&s;elf. The news of my objection was &s;oon carried, and &s;oon followed with cha&s;ti&s;ement for my gain&s;aying Samuel Fitch. Now elder James from this compari&s;on of things, I think you have no rea&s;on to blame me or any others for believing and calling you Papi&s;ts, which I
<PB N="52" REF="019212_0051_0FAA676FB26C37E8">really do, and as &s;uch enounce you, and de|clare my&s;elf a Prote&s;tant. Prote&s;ting again&s;t your Romi&s;h idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, as Luther did in his time, expecting the Popi&s;h bull full of invectives, which, however, I have as little faith in, as I have in your un&s;criptural doctrine and di&s;cipline. But once more by way of compari&s;on: it is evident from &s;crip|ture te&s;timony, that the man of &s;in, or my&s;tery of iniquity before its de&s;truction, &s;hall ari&s;e, full in the character given of it by St. Paul, II. The&s;&s;. 2 chap. and it has been gradually increa&s;ing ever &s;ince the fir&s;t degeneracy of the chri&s;tian religion and the ri&s;e of Popery; and the many accounts that have been given by the writers of almo&s;t every age &s;ince, even down to this day, &s;hew us, that according to Chri&s;t's words, Matt. 24&mdash;24, for there &s;hall ari&s;e fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e prophets, and &s;hall &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders, in&s;omuch that if it were po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hall deceive the very elect, has been abundantly verified by the impo&s;tures of the&s;e times, who&s;e preten&s;ions to perfection and the power of miracles, &s;uch as ca&s;ting out devils, unknown tongues vi|&s;ions, revelations and prophe&s;y; and even to be Chri&s;t him&s;elf, have turned out to be a meer cheat, and them&s;elves per&s;ons of the mo&s;t immoral and debauched lives, of all whom it would be endle&s;s to write particular|ly; yet I think, it nece&s;&s;ary to quote a few
<PB N="53" REF="019212_0052_0FAA6770683B6870">pa&s;&s;ages from a book called the French pro|phets, written in the year 1707&mdash;8. Fir&s;t, John Lacy, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in his preface to that book, gives this account of his operations in that day like yours in this, page 4th. They began by a preternatural cour&s;e of breathing, then my head come to be &s;haken violently and for|cibly, and with a very quick motion horizon|tally, or from &s;ide to &s;ide; then my &s;tomach had twitches, not much unlike an hyccup; af|terward my hands and arms were violently &s;haken, and &s;ometimes a catching or twitches all over my body. After which he &s;ays, he had the gift of tongues and prophe&s;y, and to denounce the judgments of God immediate|ly coming down on the city of London, and kingdom of England. And to make it as pub|lick as po&s;&s;ible that men might have timely warning, concerning which, as I under&s;tand, Sir Edmund Calamy, in his remark upon it &s;ays, page 34: "'Tis well known to many that it was prophetically declared by one of them, and afterward reported by many, that a di&s;mal judgment would fall on this city, in three weeks time; but ble&s;&s;ed be God, tho' many weeks have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed or elap&s;ed, this noble city, the ruin of which would be the greate&s;t joy to hell and Rome that could be, continues &s;afe." This John Lacy goes on prophe&s;ying for &s;everal days together, now and then making a &s;top or pau&s;e and whi&s;tling
<PB N="54" REF="019212_0053_0FAA677270967A00">a &s;pell, &s;ee page 71 and 72; "he whi&s;tles, he whi&s;tles, he whi&s;tles." In his prophetical de|claration he &s;ays, page 78, "with many pla|gues will I &s;trike them," he &s;triking on his knee at the &s;ame time, giving the &s;ign, page 80, "hear he rolled about on his &s;eat, work|ing with his body, and moving his head and hands like a man &s;ick at heart, page 95, he &s;hakes much his hand, and &s;eems to threaten; here he &s;trikes &s;everal times, pointing his fingers ends to his heart, crying out, O! rot|tenne&s;s, rottenne&s;s, I &s;ee it, I &s;ee it." Goes on to &s;ay, "have you not read, out of his belly &s;hall flow a &s;pring of living water: what was the meaning of that to him, who believe in Chri&s;t? and if you do not believe in my Chri&s;t, now, now, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his throne, your ci&s;tern &s;hall be empty of that lit|tle knowledge you have &s;oon." Now elder James here is the &s;ame craft that you have u&s;ed with us to terrify us along, pretending that Chri&s;t was come in you, and that if we did not believe Chri&s;t in you, viz. believe you, we &s;hould &s;oon be left de&s;titute of the know|ledge of God. See your picture in the&s;e de|ceivers and read the fact. The following words were written by one who believed in the French Prophets, in a letter to his friend, wherein he &s;ays, page 9, "but that which fully determined me in this point was their predicting things miraculous to be wrought
<PB N="55" REF="019212_0054_0FAA67734F7C4390">within a determined time by them, and that time very &s;hort, and declaring to the world, that if the power of God does not before the 29th of April next atte&s;t to the work, they will own them&s;elves deluded." Here I would ob|&s;erve, that this man was gain'd to the belief of them by their bold a&s;&s;ertions, who was un|doubtedly convinced after the 29th of April; except they could make as good a &s;hift, as I quoted by Edmund Calamy, in one of his re|marks, page 34: "in a warning which is &s;aid to have been dictated by the &s;pirit, on the 26th of July la&s;t, are the&s;e words: the tower guns will roar in a few days, by this day &s;en night; but a week and a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed, and no man could hear the &s;ound of them; by that time it &s;hould &s;eem their &s;pirit was convinced it might be charged with a fal&s;ity: upon Aug. 12th, therefore, that is 17 days after the predic|tion out came a &s;alvo; and 'tis declared that the tower guns were the guns from the tower of heaven, with which this city was to be bat|tered, and that the key of time was not yet given, by which to explain the &s;even night expre&s;&s;ed; but that a few months &s;hould pro|duce the key. Is not this a meer bantering the world, under a pretence of revelation." Now elder James is not this ju&s;t like &s;ome of your &s;hifts among you: fir&s;t to declare that the mo|ther and elders would never die, and &s;ome would &s;ay not a natural death; and when they
<PB N="56" REF="019212_0055_0FAA6773703DCAE0">did die, they either denied that they ever &s;aid &s;o, of they would &s;ay that they were not dead. I have been credibly informed, that the mother delivered it as prophe&s;y, that &s;he her&s;elf, and elder William and you, and John Partington and &s;everal more of the elders would die by per&s;ecution; and when Thaddius Noble, &s;ince the mother and elder William's death, told this prediction to John Partington, he &s;aid "why I will tell thee brother William &s;uffered to death, he bleed out of every hole in his body&mdash;I think the&s;e were the very words. Now why was he not hone&s;t enough to own the mi&s;take; but becau&s;e that would be to give up your perfection and infallibility, and convince the people. I could mention many other things that are now on my mind; but would only a&s;k you whether you think that the cau&s;e of God is upheld by fal&s;ehood and fraud? But to return, in page 24 we have an account that the French Prophets of that time declared, that a new di&s;pen&s;ation had taken place; and the millennium was ju&s;t then com|mencing, and that the new di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hall be publi&s;hed in all parts, in three years time; and the great work which &s;hould be effected was compleat re&s;toration; the whole creati|on appear in its primitive beauty, and man re|gain the perfections of Adam, and his imme|diate communion with God: and the wicked cut off by the judgments of God from the
<PB N="57" REF="019212_0056_0FAA67742FB0FFE8">earth, and &s;o &s;ay you within your time limit|ed. This was what they &s;o confidently a&s;|&s;erted, and yet an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood in every part of it, altho' attended with what they them|&s;elves, and likely thou&s;ands of others, verily thought was a miraculous power, or the pow|er of God&mdash;&s;ee Sir Richard Buckley's re|mark, page 35th, "among much more than a thou&s;and extacies that I have &s;een, I have &s;een many &s;o very much agitated and moved, that no part of their body could be &s;aid to be in repo&s;e, as if they had been &s;tomach &s;ick, heart &s;ick, fainting, rack'd with cholicks, &s;tone and gout;" and I have &s;een the &s;ame among you, even to &s;pilling blood. See another pa&s;|&s;age quoted from this &s;ame author, page 89, "and tho&s;e evidences do ari&s;e from the oper|ations and effects wrought by it, which are either of the graces of the holy &s;pirit wrought powerfully in the hearts of tho&s;e whom he has called into this di&s;pen&s;ation, or of his gifts, to wit. tho&s;e that follow the gift of prayer and &s;upplication&mdash;the gift of exhortation&mdash;of pre|diction&mdash;of languages&mdash;of di&s;cerning the &s;e|crets of the heart&mdash;the gift of mini&s;tration&mdash;of the &s;ame &s;pirit to others, by laying on of hands, and the gift of healing, of every one of which I &s;hall give clear and manife&s;t in|&s;tances." All the&s;e I know you pretend to. Much more I could quote from this author in favor of tho&s;e pretenders (he being one of
<PB N="58" REF="019212_0057_0FAA6774E9604900">their pro&s;elytes) to the new di&s;pen&s;ation, Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming&mdash;the millennium be|gan, and the gifts attending, and the great work of re&s;titution of all things to be accom|pli&s;hed in three years time. This is exactly what you pretend, only yours is to be eleven years; of which they are &s;o bold and confi|dent, that Sir Edmund Calamy &s;ays in trea|ti&s;e page 38, "they talk much of their hu|mility, but do but que&s;tion their being in&s;pir|ed and you will &s;ee di&s;dain in their looks: this is certainly true concerning you. Again he &s;ays, they openly and &s;currilou&s;ly traduce the office of the mini&s;try, and villify all that are in it without di&s;tinction, in mo&s;t opprobri|ous language: I believe there is hundreds, if not thou&s;ands that can &s;ay they have heard the &s;ame from you. Again, he &s;ays page 39, "they that &s;et up for prophets, freely pour out their cur&s;es on all that oppo&s;e them, and &s;eem to delight in nothing more than in threat|ning viols of wrath and fire from heaven on all &s;uch as refu&s;e to own them the peculiar heritage of the Lord, and his &s;pecial me&s;&s;en|gers; and &s;o do you it is well known, and for which you have had &s;ome trouble. Judg|ments on oppo&s;ers is their common theme, on which they are warme&s;t and free&s;t, and they are required not to pity tho&s;e that fall under tho&s;e judgments: nay, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of their near approach, they often &s;cornfully
<PB N="59" REF="019212_0058_0FAA6775AEA75C00">in&s;ult," and &s;o again I &s;ay do you. Now elder James this is a picture to the life in every in|&s;tance, and was I a Shaker I &s;hould know it to be mine. Fir&s;t, they then &s;aid Chri&s;t was come, and the millennium begun, and in three years time the great and grand revolution was to be accompli&s;hed, &amp;c. and they had all the gifts and operations by the accounts that you pretend to, to evince the truth of their decla|ration; and they were as bold and confident as you, and after all they got defeated in Bun|nilfieds, at the grave of Doctor Ames, and thence became a blot in the annals of England, and will remain &s;o to all future po&s;terity no doubt. Notwith&s;tanding all which, a little number of you, a woman at the head, who I have no doubt were Papi&s;ts, have rallied again with a raft of Popi&s;h tenets, and have made another &s;ally, declaring that Chri&s;t is come in you, for the &s;ame end and purpo&s;e that the others pretended, fixing the time at eleven years from the beginning of your mini&s;try at Ni&s;queuniah for the accompli&s;hment of the con&s;ummation of all things, at which time al&s;o your millennium began, or in other words u&s;urpation began&mdash;five of which years are already pa&s;&s;ed. But again, &s;ee F. C's remark, page 38, "and &s;o when they whi&s;tle and hi&s;s, and drum, and trumpet in their extacies, and take the&s;e things with many other childi&s;h and fanta&s;tick motions for evident marks of
<PB N="60" REF="019212_0059_0FAA677668A48698">a gracious vi&s;itation, and when the &s;pirit em|ploys them to beat and thump, and cuff, and trample upon one another, and to play tricks like merry Andrews upon a &s;tage. Can this be the &s;pirit of God,"&mdash;the&s;e are exactly his words of what was among them, and certainly the &s;ame is among you; except the words drum and trumpet. Again this author &s;ays con|cerning the church of Rome, page 42, "the hi&s;tories of the lives of their &s;aints are full of vi&s;ions, extraordinary revelations and exta|cies." And again he &s;ays, page 43, "the Romi&s;h church has he-&s;ains and &s;he-&s;aints, famous for vi&s;ions and revelations, from one age to another." Here I would ob&s;erve, that the church of Rome, that mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, have had tho&s;e what you call gifts of vi&s;ions, revelations, and prophe&s;y for many ages; the French prophets the &s;ame, and you the &s;ame&mdash;all pretending perfection, and yet are known to have lived at the &s;ame time in the mo&s;t &s;candalous vices, both they and you. I have read of the ma|licious zeal of the Papi&s;ts, be&s;ides the bloody inqui&s;ition, that thought it a virtue, and have committed many murders upon tho&s;e of a different per&s;ua&s;ion; and al&s;o among the French prophets and their adherents in Eng|land, of whom I have been treating. We have this account page 51, "another of them that has been charged with killing &s;everal
<PB N="61" REF="019212_0060_0FAA67782D231978">per&s;ons in cold blood, from which charge he has never yet cleared him&s;elf as I can hear of, has declared in the hearing of many, that he would murder his own father if he was com|manded to do it by in&s;piration," And from what I have &s;een of the violences committed among you, I have many times feared that murder would be done, even among your|&s;elves in your di&s;cipline; be&s;ides the rage and threatnings of &s;ome of your people again&s;t their oppo&s;ers, and all as they pretend in the gifts of God. But once more, with which I &s;hall conclude this head: &s;ee Edmund Cala|my's treati&s;e, page 47, "the late &s;tory of Mr. Ma&s;on, in Buckingham&s;hire, ought not to be forgotten, he firmly expected the appearance of Chri&s;t in a little village in that county, call|ed Water-Stratford, to conduct his people from thence to Jeru&s;alem, and begin the mil|iennium. But about the very time that was fixed for Chri&s;t's appearance, Mr. Ma&s;on died and left a company of poor deluded people behind him, who continued together praying and dancing and &s;inging night and day in hopes of Chri&s;t's &s;udden appearance among them. But after long waiting to no purpo&s;e they at la&s;t de&s;paired." Now elder James it is evident by the events that all the&s;e referred to, and many others that might be mentioned were deceived, and their poor deluded follow|ers &s;adly di&s;appointed, who&s;e credentials I
<PB N="62" REF="019212_0061_0FAA67790A4ADB70">think were exactly the &s;ame of yours; and what greater likelihood is there of your &s;uc|ceeding than they. Perhaps you will &s;ay that you have taken up a greater cro&s;s than they, in refraining or forbidding marriage, and that you mortify the fle&s;h with more bodily exer|ci&s;e than any of them ever did. Well that is true, which yet gives me but greater doubt of your &s;ucce&s;s</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in relation to &s;ome of your doctrines and character.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then: You &s;ay, as I under&s;tand, that the fir&s;t &s;in, that our fir&s;t parents committed in the garden of Eden, was the act of copula|tion, that being the forbidden fruit, which I desire you to reconcile with the command of God to them: to be fruitful and multiply, and repleni&s;h the earth, Gen. 1&mdash;28. You &s;ay, If I under&s;tand you, that Eve was the forbid|den tree, that Adam was forbid to touch on pain of death, which however agrees not with &s;cripture, for the tree of knowledge of good and evil was in the garden before the woman exi&s;ted, and Adam forbid to cat of it, &s;ee Gen. 2&mdash;9 and 17 ver&s;e. Now ob&s;erve, the act of copulation could not be the forbidden fruit, becau&s;e that could not be pertaken but toge|ther and at once; but Eve pertook of it &s;e|perately from her hu&s;band, as you may &s;ee Gen. 3&mdash;6, as al&s;o I. Tim. 2&mdash;14, therefore
<PB N="63" REF="019212_0062_0FAA677981C42DD0">what ever el&s;e it might be, the woman was not the tree, nor the act of copulation the fruit here &s;poken of; con&s;equently the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture mu&s;t be wrong, if you be right.&mdash;Ob&s;erve again, Adam was &s;orbid to touch the forbidden tree, Gen. 3&mdash;3; but concerning his wife it is &s;aid, Gen. 2&mdash;24, therefore &s;hall a man leave his father and mother and &s;hall cleave unto his wife, and they &s;hall be one fle&s;h, which could not be but by a touch of copulation, which was it that made them one fle&s;h. This de&s;troys the idea of the woman's being the tree that Adam was forbid to touch. This therefore proves your hypothe&s;is to be fal&s;e, which is the grand fundamental pillar of your whole &s;y&s;tem, which mu&s;t go head|long for want of a better foundation. Again, you &s;ay, that all marriages were and are of the devil, fir&s;t and la&s;t. Here again you are too fa&s;t, for marriage was in&s;tituted and performed in the garden before the fall, as appears Gen. 2d chap. 22d 23d 24th ver&s;es, and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman, and brought her unto the man, and Adam &s;aid, this is now bone of my bone and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h: &s;he &s;hall be called woman becau&s;e &s;he was taken out of man: therefore &s;hall a man leave his father and mo|ther, and &s;hall cleave unto his wife, and they &s;hall be one fle&s;h. This is marriage in every &s;en&s;e of it: for its proper definition is agree|ing
<PB N="64" REF="019212_0063_0FAA677A29170718">and joining together. Is it not therefore pre&s;umptuous to contradict &s;cripture? And call this of the devil? Again Gen. 24th chap. wherein you may &s;ee the godline&s;s, the &s;olem|nity and in&s;piration of I&s;aac and Rebeckah's marriage, of the angels attending, ver&s;e 7, the ble&s;&s;ing and prediction of Rebecka's being the mother of thou&s;ands and millions, and that her &s;eed &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the gate of tho&s;e that hate them, as in ver&s;e 60, and preceeding this in the 50th ver&s;e, then Laban and Bethuel an&s;wered and &s;aid, the thing proceedeth from Lord&mdash;but you &s;ay from the devil. Therefore I de&s;ire you to con&s;ider whether you be able to di&s;pute this point with God. Again, &s;ee Matt. 19&mdash;4&mdash;5&mdash;6, and he an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and &s;aid for this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave father and mother and &s;hall cleave to his wife, and they twain &s;hall be one fle&s;h. And what follows in the 6th ver&s;e is the ad|dition of Chri&s;t's own words: wherefore they are no more twain, but one fle&s;h: what there|fore God has joined together let no man put a&s;under. Here ob&s;erve, Chri&s;t acknowledges that God joined them together, and forbids man to put them a&s;under; but you &s;ay the devil joined them together, and go about to put them a&s;under, in which you both contra|dict Chri&s;t and break his command. And a|gain
<PB N="65" REF="019212_0064_0FAA677B07B943B0">Paul in his go&s;pel &s;ays, Eph. 5&mdash;22 wives &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto your own hu&s;bands as unto the Lord: ver&s;e 23, for the hu&s;band is the head of the wife, even as Chri&s;t is the head of the church, &amp;c. therefore as the church is &s;ubject unto Chri&s;t, &s;o let the wives be to their own hu&s;bands in every thing; ver&s;e 25, hu&s;bands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the church, &amp;c. ver&s;e 28, &s;o ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife loveth him&s;elf: ver&s;e 29, for no man ever yet hated his own fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it, even as the Lord the church. Then in reference to the &s;acred in&s;titution of marriage, in the &s;ame words before quoted &s;ays, ver&s;e 31, for this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave his father and mother, and &s;hall be joined unto his wife, and they two &s;hall be one fle&s;h. Mark, &s;everal things may be noted from this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture: fir&s;t, that the Apo&s;tle makes u&s;e of the marriage &s;tate and union between the hu&s;band &amp; wife to repre&s;ent the marriage &s;tate and union between Chri&s;t and the church; by which he acknow|ledgeth the marriages that you di&s;own, and gives &s;pecial rules for them to go by. Second|ly, that the&s;e rules and commands were given to hu&s;bands and wives as &s;uch, who were at the &s;ame time al&s;o married to Chri&s;t, &s;ee Rom. 7, hence learn, that being married to a wo|man doth not hinder us from being married

<P>Fourthly, if marriages were all of the devil, I wonder the Apo&s;tle &s;hould make u&s;e of that for a compari&s;on of the &s;piritual &s;tate and un|ion between Chri&s;t and his church. Again, St. Paul &s;ays, Heb. 13&mdash;4, marriage is honor|able in all, and the bed undefiled; but whore|mongers and adulterers God will judge&mdash;which being given out in po&s;itive terms, in the new covenant mini&s;tration, I think is &s;uf|ficient to decide all controver&s;ies, and &s;till the clamours that may ari&s;e on this head. But to return, with reference to the forbidden fruit, you &s;ay as I &s;aid before that it was the act of copulation between Adam and Eve, and is &s;till forbidden fruit to every man and his wife, therefore it is incumbent on you to &s;hew where it is forbidden and by whom, that I &amp; others may believe it upon better authority than your bare a&s;&s;ertion. I de&s;ire you would an&s;wer this que&s;tion if you are able, or own that I was right in &s;aying you had renounced or at lea&s;t did not go by the bible, for if you cannot prove that act to be forbidden by God, then certainly you are mi&s;taken in calling that the forbidden fruit, which was not nor is not forbidden. I know that for me o copulate with another man's wife, or to &s;teal another man's goods would be forbidden fruit, becau&s;e God hath commanded &s;aying, thou &s;halt not
<PB N="67" REF="019212_0066_0FAA677C72825410">commit adultery&mdash;thou &s;halt not &s;teal; but I am far from believing that Adam's copu|lating with his wife, when he was implicitly bid to do it, was the occa&s;ion of his fall, for it was certainly and in&s;eparably connected with multiplying, and his &s;in con&s;i&s;ted only in breaking the command of God: for where no law is, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, Rom. 4, 15. Again, &s;in is not imputed when there is no law, Rom. 5&mdash;13. And again, nay I had not known &s;in, but by the law, for I had not known la&s;t, except the law had &s;aid, thou &s;halt not covet, Rom. 7&mdash;7, therefore except you can produce the law of God that forbids copulation between man and wife, you cannot make it a &s;in, and con&s;equently that could not be the cau&s;e of Adam's fall. And again, except you can produce the law of God that forbids marriage, you cannot make it a &s;in, and therefore not of the devil, as you pretend. And St. Paul &s;ays, I. Cor. 7&mdash;28, but and if thou marry, thou ha&s;t not &s;inned, and if a vir|gin marry &s;he hath not &s;inned. Now elder James by what has been &s;aid it is evident, that you deny and contradict the &s;cripture, both of the old and new te&s;tament, and there|by have departed from the faith of tho&s;e holy men, that wrote the &s;criptures, and con&s;equent|ly mu&s;t fall into that character given by St. Paul, I.

<P>Fir&s;t, The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, viz. the Apo&s;tle's faith and go&s;pel, then certainly tho&s;e that renounce it, calling all that is written in the bible letter, old heavens, and a back di&s;|pen&s;ation, and that Chri&s;t therein te&s;tified of that we believe in, and depend on for &s;alvati|on, to be anti-chri&s;t, the devil, old belzebub, high king of hell, which are Samuel Fitch's words and terms for it, and to which you al&s;o agree. I &s;ay I think &s;uch have to all intents departed from the faith, in the &s;en&s;e of the text, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits and doctrines of devils, as if he &s;hould &s;ay, giving heed to them &s;pirits that deceive, mi&s;lead, and debauch people: &s;ee the definition agreeable with that Rev. 2&mdash;20, notwith&s;tanding I have a few things again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou &s;uffere&s;t that woman Jezebel, which calleth her&s;elf a pro|phete&s;s,

For e|very creature of God is good, and nothing to be refu&s;ed, if it be received with thank&s;giving: ver&s;e 5th. For it is &s;anctified by the word of God and prayer. Here it is plain, the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of forbidding to marry, as a grand ma|terial article in the doctrines of devils, which is given as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of tho&s;e de|ceivers here &s;poken of. And now that you might &s;ee, that you have departed from the A|po&s;tles go&s;pel, and con&s;equently from the faith; I refer you to 1 Tim. 3d chap. where the &s;ame Apo&s;tle gives the character of Bi&s;hops and Deacons, each having a wife and children, and yet chief officers in the church of Chri&s;t: that it might be &s;een and known, in tho&s;e lat|ter times &s;poken of by the &s;pirit, that there was no &s;uch thing, as forbidding to marry, in the church of Chri&s;t: and that thereby tho&s;e deceivers &s;poken of in the latter times, that &s;hould ari&s;e, forbidding to marry, might be
<PB N="72" REF="019212_0071_0FAA6781571F1CF8">more ea&s;ily known and detected. Now elder James, by this you ought to be convinced of your error, in forbidding to marry: and that you do forbid to marry, is certainly true, I have often heard you deny it, and as often heard you forbid it, at lea&s;t implicitly, I can in&s;tance particulars, wherein you have forbid, and even prevented marriages, to wit. Han|nah Kindale has often told in publick that &s;he was ju&s;t going to be married to the man &s;he loved before &s;he fell in with you. Jonathan Sho&s;&s;on was going to be married to Hannah Goodrich; Job Bi&s;hop was going to have De&s;ier Sanford; William Miles and Mary Clerk as I have heard&mdash;many more I could mention that are now on my mind, that were likely agreed to marry, but were broken off and terrified out of it by you: nor do you allow any in your community, but &s;uch as wholly renounce marriages: and tho&s;e that were married before, you part them forever or di&s;own them; and for a further conformation of this I can &s;ay I was pre&s;ent with the mother one time at A&s;hfield, when &s;he undertook to break the marriage of Pitman Cook and his wife, and I a&s;&s;i&s;ted therein, and dar'd not do otherwi&s;e, for fear of falling under her di&s;|plea&s;ure. The manner was this, &s;he having prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of her people, that &s;he her&s;elf was that battle-ax and weapon of war, &s;poken of in Jeremiah 51&mdash;20 that was to
<PB N="73" REF="019212_0072_0FAA6781CE591498">break in pieces the nations and de&s;troy king|doms: &s;he was to break in pieces the hor&s;e and his rider: the chariot and his rider: &s;he was to break in pieces man and woman, old and young: the young man and the maid, &amp;c. She &s;aid it was their lu&s;t brought them together, and that he that married them was not a man of God, and therefore what he did was not of God, but of the devil, and there|fore void, not regarding what is &s;poken by Malachi, 2d chap. 14&mdash;15&mdash;16 ver&s;e, the whole paragraph to which I refer you, and de|&s;ire you to read: and I &s;uppo&s;e they hold their marriage to be void, and them&s;elves acquit from each other ever &s;ince, for they call their marriage covenant a covenant of death and hell, and &s;o do many if not all the re&s;t. At another time at Harwood, I being pre&s;ent, Samuel Fitch, I &s;uppo&s;e by the mother's di|rection brought in his wife and &s;on, and I think daughter too, that being all his family, ordered them to kneel down, then kneeled down with them him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of an a&s;&s;embly of their own sort of people, then in the audience of the whole, in a &s;olemn man|ner, renounced his wife and children, as be|ing his wife and children ever any more, and forbid his wife ever e&s;teeming him her hu&s;band again, declaring &s;he was no more his wife, nor he her hu&s;band&mdash;this I &s;aw and heard, which was de&s;igned as I &s;uppo&s;ed to give a lead to
<PB N="74" REF="019212_0073_0FAA6782681012B0">others. Be&s;ides the &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ements and many methods taken by you to &s;et men and women, hu&s;bands and wives at the greate&s;t di&s;tance in affection from each other. now elder James are not the&s;e things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to marry in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e? and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> not this with what el&s;e has been &s;aid, which I defy you to deny, bring you full into the character here given by St. Paul, of tho&s;e that depart from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits and doctrines of devils, &s;peaking lies in hypocrify having their con&s;cience &s;eared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry &amp;c. what follows in the 4th and 5th ver&s;e being a declaration, of Gods approbation to the marriage rights; I &s;hall pa&s;s to another ob&s;ervation in the &s;ame chap. Ver&s;e 7th. But refu&s;e prophane and old wife's fables; and exerci&s;e thy&s;elf rather unto Godline&s;s: ver&s;e 8th, for bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little, &amp;c. ver&s;e 9th, this is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation. Here ob&s;erve, it is evident to me at lea&s;t, that the mother was a very profane old wife, and that her doctrines were meer fables, being I think altogether un&s;criptural, and her religion con|&s;i&s;ted much in bodily exerci&s;e, and therefore of little profit: this is another characteri&s;tick given by the Apo&s;tle in the &s;ame chapter with the above, and then concludes emphatically in the following words, this is a faithful &s;aying and worthy of all acceptation, which is a clear
<PB N="75" REF="019212_0074_0FAA6784EC668038">manife&s;tation of the Apo&s;tle's di&s;approbation of what you make &s;o much account of you laying the whole &s;tre&s;s of our &s;alyation upon our faith in and obedience to an old wife's &s;ables and great bodily exerci&s;es, which the Apo&s;tle &s;ets nothing at all by. Herein there|fore appears a great difference between you and the Apo&s;tles, which you account for by the introduction of a new di&s;pen&s;ation, which however I think brings you into a mo&s;t dole|ful character according to &s;cripture predic|tion. Now elder James by what has been &s;aid it is evident, that however wrong all others may be, you cannot be right, if the &s;criptures be true: and tho' you may pretend to be be|yond them, and hence take liberty to go con|trary to them, I de&s;ire you to read this adver|ti&s;ement of a runaway, departed from the faith: take warning and return, left you be taken up by it and puni&s;hed according to the rule which the &s;criptures gives in &s;uch ca&s;es. Again, II.

<P>And indeed herein lies the power of decep|tion; all which great and wonderful things, is yet no evidence of their being the people of God; But the contrary; e&s;pecially if they oppo&s;e and exalt them&s;elves, pretending to be Chri&s;t, and at the &s;ame time, having ba&s;e mo|rale; working as in ver&s;e 10th with all de|ceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s &amp;c. which ju&s;t completes the character of tho&s;e deceiv|ers here &s;poken of, ver&s;e 11th, and for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ions, that they &s;hould believe a lie; ver&s;e 12, that they all might be demned who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.

But &s;econdly, with re&s;pect to the my&s;tery of iniquity among you, I can &s;ay that I have been confounded many times, not knowing how to account for &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies, or re|concile &s;uch high appearances of religion and &s;incerity, with &s;uch wickedne&s;s and abomina|tions at the &s;ame time, in the &s;ame per&s;ons; nothing was more common among you, than to u&s;e the mo&s;t prophane language, e&s;pecially when cha&s;tizing others&mdash;yet in the highe&s;t zeal of religion; and to u&s;e equivocations and deceit under a pretence of defending the cau&s;e of God, and even when in liquor much more re&s;olute for God again&s;t &s;in than at other times. Your per&s;uading of us that liquor o|perated right the contrary in you that were
<PB N="82" REF="019212_0081_0FAA6676AE28A680">perfect to what it did in them that were not: that whereas it influenced them to &s;erve the devil; it animated you to &s;erve God: and even in the times of your intoxications, there would be an appearance of the mighty power and gifts of God in you, as you call it: I al|&s;o have took notice that by the greate&s;t fits of anger, rage and execrations again&s;t &s;omebody or other, you would find the greate&s;t relea&s;e|ment, as if your &s;ouls were &s;olaced in heaven. One thing a man told me that he &s;aw of a quar|rel between the mother and elder William, that was very &s;harp and bloody, with many hard blows, and dreadful cur&s;ing and outrage, till they were both maul'd and brui&s;ed by each other, and directly after the people were cha&s;|tized for fal&s;e judging, and this &s;alvo put up|on it, that Paul and Barnabas contended and parted: and Paul with&s;tood Peter to the face, keeping up a &s;hew of religion in it; and when any of you come out again&s;t others, in the greate&s;t railleries and accu&s;ations, many of which I have no doubt were fal&s;e, you would turn it into a pretence of love and faithfulne&s;s to them; and &s;o you find ways to turn every vice into a virtue, giving way to your pa&s;&s;ions, foul language, equivocations to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, and hard drinking, which are all con|demned by the &s;criptures, and yet all in com|mon practice among you in the highe&s;t pre|ten&s;ions of religion, and attended with the
<PB N="83" REF="019212_0082_0FAA66776D54A510">mighty power and gifts of God to all appear|ance. This looks I think like a my&s;tery of iniquity, where the greate&s;t abominations are committed: children abu&s;ing their parents in the mo&s;t &s;hocking manner that ever was heard of, being &s;et on by the mother and you, and ruling over their parents: and wives rul|ing over their hu&s;bands, all which is again&s;t the laws of God and nature: yet all under the highe&s;t appearance of divine approbation, be|ing attended at the &s;ame time with an increa&s;e of tho&s;e &s;upernatural gifts. This I &s;ay looks like the my&s;tery of iniquity &s;poken of, and a|grees with that Rev. 17&mdash;5, and upon her fore|head was a name written my&s;tery&mdash;Babylon the great&mdash;the mother of harlots&mdash;and abom|inations of the earth. But again, thirdly, it is &s;aid that the coming of Chri&s;t is after the working of Satan, with all power and &s;igns &amp; lying wonders: and this is the ca&s;e with you, for you a&s;&s;ume the prerogative of all power under heaven, and without di&s;tinction or re|&s;erve, villify and condemn it, as what mu&s;t &s;all before you, and acknowledge your mini|&s;tration fir&s;t and la&s;t: and be&s;ides you pretend to the power of miracles, which if it were &s;o, is no more than what the fal&s;e prophet and unclean &s;pirits could do, as before quoted: to be &s;ure you have power to &s;care and terrify your own people e&s;pecially, and make them believe ju&s;t what you plea&s;e: and indeed &s;o
<PB N="84" REF="019212_0083_0FAA66782B81B9D0">far as I my&s;elf believe you to be tho&s;e deceivers here &s;poken of, I believe you to have the pow|er of fal&s;e miracles, for I have &s;een one that was of you, cau&s;e fire to come down from heaven, as I then thought, he being in a great rage, gave a violent &s;creech and &s;tamp with his foot, at which in&s;tant I &s;aw a fla&s;h of fire or lightning all at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant. Another per&s;on told me that he &s;aw the &s;ame thing at another time. One time when I was at the church, as elder William came out of his room, he &s;aid he heard a clap of thunder among the dead, and &s;aw the lightning. Here ob&s;erve, we read that the&s;e things &s;hall be done by the bea&s;t, which includes the fal&s;e prophet and unclean &s;pirits; but not a word of any &s;uch thing is ever &s;aid &s;hall be &s;een or done among the people of God. I would ju&s;t fur|ther &s;ay, you have the power of deception, to &s;hift and turn your&s;elves into every &s;hape to deceive. 4thly, Signs and lying wonders every body that knows you, knows that you are full of &s;igns: &s;igns with the hand, polling, point|ing, reaching, &s;winging, touching, &s;troking, &s;triking, &s;haking, and the like: as al&s;o on the floor falling down, rolling, tumbling, wallow|ing, kicking, thumping, pitching over, roaring, crying, &s;creaming, hollowing <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o be|ing led about by &s;igns, following the band this way and that: moreover hi&s;&s;ing, mouthing, lolling out the tongue, grinning, biting, glar|ing,
<PB N="85" REF="019212_0084_0FAA6679098A7D58">with many &s;trange po&s;tures of the body and limbs: be&s;ides great trembling, &s;haking, turning, twitching, &s;tamping with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> voice, now and then hollowing out &s;harp and &s;udden. Now whether you call the&s;e &s;igns good or bad, they are among you, and exact|ly agree with this prediction, and where do you &s;ee it el&s;e? 5thly, Lying wonders and &s;igns without meaning or &s;ignification, are the &s;ame thing: yet there are other things that may more properly be con&s;idered as what is meant by lying wonders, to wit. vi&s;ions, which are very frequent and wonderful, yet little or no truth in them, and nothing to be known by them as I can &s;ee.</P>
<P>Even the mother's vi&s;ions were no better, for I have often heard of a vi&s;ion that &s;he had of you, in which &s;he &s;aw you in the very act of copulation with a woman; which you mu&s;t own was a lying wonder, or betray your guilt; either of which dethrones you. Again Eleazer Goodrich's revelation at Amos Rath|bun's, where he charged a man with mur|dering a per&s;on in times pa&s;t, and of hav|ing a de&s;ign then of murdering a woman, and her two children, and to prevent which, &s;ent two men privately to watch the hou&s;e the night it was to be done, which turned out to be a lying wonder. I did not &s;ee this my&s;elf; but often heard the &s;tory and believed it, even altho' I was then in that faith;
<PB N="86" REF="019212_0085_0FAA6679B2C2B0A0">but I &s;aw him a day or two after at Ezekiel Goodrich's, where as though he was Chri&s;t, took the judgment &s;eat, cut off anumber of &s;ouls, and &s;entenced them to hell; baptized &s;everal per&s;ons in the name of the Trinity; and &s;aying he that betrayed him was at hand: then putting one hand to his forehead, pu&s;h|ing it back and with the other hand, with his forefinger, would &s;aw acro&s;s his throat, re|peating the &s;ign &s;everal times over, and &s;aying again, that he that betrayed him was at hand; and that in three days, he &s;hould be perfect|ed; at which I, and I believe all the re&s;t pre|&s;ent, thought that the man, whom he had ac|cu&s;ed of murder at Amos Rathbun's, had a de&s;ign again&s;t his life; for I found by his expre&s;&s;ions, that it was he that &s;hould betray him; I tarried till late at night before I went home, and afterward enquired, and found that nobody came neither then, nor afterward to give him any di&s;turbance; which though attended with &s;uch a mighty power, and &s;igns, as would &s;care people into the belief of it; yet was but a lying wonder. I could menti|on the names of a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons that have been cut off, and received the &s;entence of damnation from tho&s;e that have a&s;&s;umed the judgment &s;eat, one of which was confirmed by the mother; who has &s;ince been re&s;tored, and is now in good &s;tanding among you: and I was knowing that his &s;en|tence
<PB N="87" REF="019212_0086_0FAA667C2FE91B30">was everla&s;ting woe; and never to find repentance: I have been often &s;cared and ter|rified almo&s;t out of my wits by &s;uch things, till I found that great part if not all, was but lying wonders: I have had to run to the relief of your people in Tyringham, with all &s;peed while I was in that way, who were in the ut|mo&s;t confu&s;ion, almo&s;t in di&s;traction and de&s;|pair, by the havock which William Allen and his wife, and &s;ome others made in that place, by their lying wonders; yea one of them that was a believer in your way told me, that in one of his wives high religious turns, he never &s;aw any creature &s;o full of lying won|ders as &s;he was. I &s;aw the mother one time, in a great rage with one of Elijah Wiles's &s;i&s;|ters, for &s;omething &s;he had &s;aid about the church, &s;he cut her off, and gave her wholly to the devil as I took it, and &s;aid, that within a fortnight &s;he would hang her&s;elf, as there was a God. The&s;e I think were exactly her words, which terrified me very much, believing then as I had been taught, that not one of her words could fail; but no &s;uch thing happen|ed, for I have long &s;ince &s;een the girl alive and well. At another time, I heard the mo|ther tell a vi&s;ion to Nathan Goodrich, how &s;he &s;aw the great angel of God going forth, blowing his trumpet, and his brother Ezeki|el that was dead was with him, and that &s;he had a particular command from them, or
<PB N="88" REF="019212_0087_0FAA667D5951AC98">from God, to come to his hou&s;e, and warn him of approaching death; and admoni&s;h him to &s;et his hou&s;e in order. This is now a|bove a year and half age, and the man is yet alive and well I believe, for I live not far from him. There was al&s;o a prophe&s;y, uttered by one of the brethren, that Albany &s;hould be de&s;troyed within one year from that time, which is I think about three years ago; but I heard but lately it &s;tands &s;afe yet; and all with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urances, and yet ab&s;olute|ly lying wonders; and what makes them &s;uch, is becau&s;e they are not true, for the events prove it; and yet you have the confidence to threaten people with the judgments of God, damnation and the bottomle&s;s pit, if they do not believe, and &s;ubject to your lead and go|vernment; by which many are terrified into it; others being won by flatteries are taken in and lod away byit. But 6thly, deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, making u&s;e of &s;cripture, &s;uch as &s;uits your turn, to catch and entangle them that hear you, when at the &s;ame time it is a declared principle among tho&s;e of you that are &s;trong, that you are in a new day and di&s;pen&s;ation, beyond the bible and do not mean to go by it, nor make any rule of it; at the &s;ame time you will hold forth certain per|fect rules in &s;cripture, to convict people of their imperfection and &s;hort coming, and thereby de&s;troy all the faith, in what they had
<PB N="89" REF="019212_0088_0FAA667E425843F8">received, and by telling them that you are perfect draw them away after you: is not this deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, fir&s;t to make u&s;e of &s;cripture to decoy and catch o|thers, which you will not own nor go by your|&s;elves? &s;econdly, to de&s;troy all their former faith by the &s;cripture, and build them up in a|nother without the &s;cripture, often quoting your vi&s;ions, revelations, unknown tongues and prophe&s;y, as the infallible evidence of your being the only people of God in the world: which however I think, upon a proper di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of matters, is no more nor le&s;s, then what is given in this and the like character, as the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks, of the greate&s;t deceivers &s;poken of in the whole bible. I have been much burdened latterly, with almo&s;t all your expo&s;itions of &s;cripture; believing that you corrupted the word, and perverted the people; whether ignorantly or de&s;ignedly I leave; but you would certainly read wrong, and put a wrong con&s;truction upon it; which whether it were ignorance or craft in you, it certainly di&s;qualifies you for the high &s;tation you a&s;&s;ume, and proves there is no &s;uch thing as perfecti|on and infallibillity in you, as you pretend. I &s;hall give but only one in&s;tance, Rom. 11, 22. Behold therefore the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God, on them which fell, &s;everity; which was &s;peaking of the fall of the Jews through unbelief. But you would read it thus, on
<PB N="90" REF="019212_0089_0FAA667EF1DCB5A0">them which feel &s;everity, per&s;uading the peo|ple from the words, that it was the goodne&s;s of God to them for to feel &s;everity, and take the liberty to be more &s;evere, and cruel to them as I thought. This you would often menti|on, and whether you know better yet, or not, I cannot tell; for I was &s;o kept under I dared not tell you of it. Now elder James, upon the whole, if you &s;hould deny this character here given by St. Paul to be yours, I beg you would tell me who&s;e it is, and make out the compari&s;on to demon&s;tration as I have done, in reference to you, by comparing what I have found among&s;t you in fact; with tho&s;e parti|cular pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture herein referred to. For nothing is certainly known to be right or wrong, but by the &s;acred record of truth, which is given as a rule to try the &s;pirits by; which is the next thing to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I John 4, 1, Beloved, believe not every &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they are of God: Becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets are gone out into the world. As if he had &s;aid prove them, compare and try them, by the rules that I give you, and by the written word of God, But elder James, you will not allow of it; But you &s;ay, we mu&s;t believe and obey what you &s;ay at a venture, or go to hell: here|in therefore is a trial of the &s;pirits at once, ver&s;e 2; hereby know ye the &s;pirit of God; every &s;pirit that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is
<PB N="91" REF="019212_0090_0FAA667FE73D16F8">come in the fle&s;h is of God: here is an infal|lible rule given, to try the &s;pirits by; and no man can &s;ay, that Je&s;us is the Lord; but by the Holy Gho&s;t; neither can any man confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, but they that have received him; viz. his &s;pirit, his words and go&s;pel; neither can any man confe&s;s Chri&s;t, that does not know Chri&s;t; and he that &s;aith he knows him, and keepeth not his commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. I John 2, 4, But again, it was a thing well under&s;tood in the days of the Apo&s;tles, that Chri&s;t was come in the fle&s;h, for the de&s;|truction of the fle&s;h; therefore to confe&s;s Chri&s;t come in the fle&s;h, is to confe&s;s the bo|dy of &s;in de&s;troyed, to wit; the carnal mind which is a fle&s;hly mind, vicious habits, appe|tites and inclinations of the fle&s;h de&s;troyed; as appears Colo&s;. 2, 11, in whom al&s;o you are circumci&s;ed with the circumci&s;ion made with|out hands, in putting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, by the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t; as if he &s;hould &s;ay, in whom al&s;o ye are cut off, with the cutting off made without hands, in the putting of the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, by the cutting off of Chri&s;t; mark, circum|ci&s;ion under the law, was a figure of the cut|ting off of Chri&s;t, or the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, which body of &s;ins, Chri&s;t takes up|on him&s;elf, in behalf of all his elect, in a &s;pe|cial manner, and was cut off for them. There|fore
<PB N="92" REF="019212_0091_0FAA6680696DB298">as it is &s;aid, that Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;over was &s;lain for us, even &s;o Chri&s;t our body of &s;ins was cut off for us; in whom we have redemp|tion through his blood; even the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins: again, I Peter 4, 1, fora&s;much then, as Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered for us in the fle&s;h, arm your&s;elves with the &s;ame mind; for he that hath &s;uffered in the fle&s;h, hath cea&s;ed from &s;in. Rom. 6, 6, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of &s;in might be de&s;troyed, that henceforth we &s;hould not &s;erve &s;in; ver&s;e 7th for he that is dead, is freed from &s;in, as if he had &s;aid, by Chri&s;t's dying for us, we are dead to &s;in:ver&s;e 8th now if we be dead with Chri&s;t, we believe that we &s;hall al&s;o live with him; which death to &s;in, and life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, we obtain or come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, through faith in him; and not for any thing that we have done, or can do. Therefore who&s;oever confe&s;&s;eth, that Je|&s;u&s; Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, is of God, and feels his &s;oul delivered from the fle&s;h, by Chri&s;t's coming in the fle&s;h, and if he cannot expre&s;s it experimentally for him&s;elf, it is no confe&s;&s;ion at all; he is antichri&s;t or of antichri&s;t. Now elder James, I do not remember of ever hearing any &s;uch things as the&s;e among you, the whole four years and half that I was with you, nor have I the lea&s;t idea, that you have any expectation of &s;alvation by him that died on calvary, according to the
<PB N="93" REF="019212_0092_0FAA66813116F0B8">mini&s;tration given by him and his apo&s;tles in that day. But it was mothers mini&s;try, and mothers &s;ufferings while &s;he lived, and now it is yours.</P>
<P>But I de&s;ire your further attention, Rom. 8&mdash;8, &s;o then they that are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God, to wit, they that are not delivered from the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h through faith in Chri&s;t, cannot plea&s;e God, for &s;uch are in the fle&s;h in the &s;en&s;e of the text, and may be known by their fruit, as we find Gal. 5&mdash;19, now the works of the fle&s;h are mani|fe&s;t, which are the&s;e, adultery, fornication, un|cleanne&s;s, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s: ver&s;e 20, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, &s;trifes, &s;editions, here&s;ies: ver&s;e 21, envying, murders, drukenne&s;s, reveling, and &s;uch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have al&s;o told you in time pa&s;t, that they that do &s;uch things &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. Now elder James, fir&s;t, I cannot &s;ay that you in particular are guilty of adultery or forni|cation in a natural &s;en&s;e, tho' you may be in the highe&s;t degree, in a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e; but it is evident there is many that are of you, who are guilty in the natural way. 2dly, I &s;uppo&s;e that filthy dreams defiles the fle&s;h, and is uncleanne&s;s, Jude 8 ver&s;e, of which there is more among you I believe, than any where el&s;e, as I am greatly knowing, having been a father confe&s;&s;ion among you. 3dly, And I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="019212_0093_0FAA6681E9207910">that for you to order men and women to &s;trip naked and dance, and go &s;wim together, is laciviou&s;ne&s;s. 4thly, And I &s;uppo&s;e there was never more abominable idolatry commit|ed than there is among you, by their making a God of you, and you of your&s;elf. 5thly, And I &s;uppo&s;e that all &s;educers are witches and wizzards, and all fal&s;e doctrines here&s;ies, and delu&s;ions are witchcraft. The Galatians were bewitched in that way, which is no doubt the apo&s;tles meaning here. 6thly, And ha|tred here &s;poken of evidently abounds among you, e&s;pecially again&s;t tho&s;e that are in oppo|&s;ition. It is a common thing to hear one and another of you expre&s;s your hatred again&s;t &s;uch and &s;uch ones when you are commanded to hate no man, and to love your enemies. 7thly, Again, variance, I have &s;een and heard much of even among you that call your&s;elves the church, and el&s;ewhere among you. 8thly, Emulation is envy and di&s;dain, &s;triving to go beyond others. And do you not &s;et your|&s;elves up above all others, and even envy and di&s;dain them; but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are not of you. I have heard elder John Part|ington tell a man that was a believer among you, that he felt as if his &s;oul di&s;dained the o|ther man's &s;oul. 9thly, Again, wrath is &s;o apparent, their needs no particular inferences given: you call it the wrath of God, which I doubt of; but if it were &s;o, where is any go&s;|pel
<PB N="95" REF="019212_0094_0FAA668445F187B8">rule for you to act it out in the manner you do? It is put into this catalogue as the works of the fle&s;h. 10thly, And again, &s;trife is among you in a high degree, far beyond what I ever &s;aw it in any other people, profe&s;&s;or or prophane I think. 11th, Al&s;o &s;edition, break|ing up families, &s;etting &s;ome again&s;t the others and bringing the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, trouble and di&s;tre&s;s upon them, if they would not all come into your way. It would be too tedious to mention the number of families that are broken by what I &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;edition, one &s;et again&s;t another: and where there is any of your &s;ort of people in a family, they mu&s;t have the rules, if it be but a child, or quit the family, tho' again&s;t the parents will and com|mands. 12th, Again, Here&s;ies, I &s;uppo&s;e, that all that is held to or preached up contra|ry to the bible, is here&s;y; at lea&s;t I take that to be the apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e of it: and I do not &s;ee wherein you go by it, or according to it at all. 13th, And again envyings, I leave it to you elder James whether you do not envy me, if not, &s;ee if there is none el&s;e of you that do, for I &s;u&s;pect them. 14th, Again, murders. I do not think that you have de&s;ignedly mur|dered any body; but I believe you have been the cau&s;e of many deaths by driving people beyond their &s;trength: I would only give my opinion in this and leave it to God. 15th, Again, drunkenne&s;s, this is al&s;o among you,
<PB N="96" REF="019212_0095_0FAA6685F4DABF18">and is what I &s;o often complained of, as you will likely remember, and what fir&s;t began to open my eyes to &s;ee other mi&s;demeanours. La&s;tly, revelings, are high carou&s;ing dances, this or &s;omething very much like it I think is al&s;o among you in the highe&s;t degree, all which the apo&s;tle &s;ays are the works of the fle&s;h: and as he had told them before, he tells them a|gain, that they that do &s;uch things &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. Now then I would make this inference, that whoever does the&s;e works of the fle&s;h, has not the body of &s;in de&s;troyed in him, and therefore Chri&s;t is not come in him, pretend what he will: nor does he, nor can he confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, and therefore not of God: he is anti-chri&s;t, as &s;aith the apo&s;tle. But once more ver&s;e 6th, we are of God: he that know|eth God heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us, hereby know we the &s;pirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of error. Here the apo&s;tle peremptorily declares, that they in that day were of God, and they that know God would hear them; But you &s;ay you know God, and yet will not hear them, nor go by them. Here you contradict the apo&s;tle, and fleeing again to the horns of your old alter for refuge, by pretending that you are in a new di&s;pen&s;ation beyond them, which is a covering for every variation from them. What right then have you to take this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture from them
<PB N="97" REF="019212_0096_0FAA668674AC2180">as you do, and apply it to your&s;elves? and now call upon others in their words to come to your terms, &s;aying, they that know God hear|eth you, and they that are not of God heareth not you. Is not this impo&s;ing upon people with craft and deception? But the apo&s;tle has determined it, that if you or any other will not hear them, you are not of God: and tells us that hereby we &s;hall know the &s;pirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of error. But now having tried the &s;pirit by the help of God thus far, I &s;hall clo&s;e this head in the words of St. Paul, Eph. 4&mdash;14, that we henceforth be no more children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the &s;light of men and cunning craftine&s;s whereby they lie in weight to deceive. But again for a further trial of the &s;pirits by the word, in a more general &s;en&s;e, in which I pray God give me animpartial mind, and under&s;tanding; I&s;aiah 8, 19. And when they &s;hall &s;ay unto you, &s;eek unto them that have familiar &s;pirits, and unto wiz|ards that peep, and that mutter; &s;hould not a people &s;eek unto their God? For the living to the dead? It is certain elder James, that you have a number of per&s;ons out abroad in the world, great part of the time, if not all, who are per&s;uading people to &s;eek unto you, and it is as certain, that &s;pirits do attend you, and &s;peak to you and you to them: I do not &s;ay you are wizards; but I think I may &s;ay that
<PB N="98" REF="019212_0097_0FAA6687392ADB70">you are con&s;tantly peeping in every dark hole and corner, to &s;py out &s;omething ami&s;s in peo|ple. And the definition of muttering, is &s;peaking confu&s;edly; and it appears to me, that you did all make a God of the mother; and though &s;he is dead, you &s;eek to her for the living that is, them that are alive. I do now really think, I have not &s;trained any one point; but have given a &s;hort and true account of things as they be. Here the prophet as much as &s;ays, when any &s;hall &s;ay unto you, to &s;eek to &s;uch a people as this, then he &s;ay ver&s;e 20th, To the law and to the te&s;timony; if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them: which he refers to, as a rule to try them by; which appears to me, as an infallible proof again&s;t you; &s;eeing you have renounced the law and te&s;timony. And where, or whenever, we find a people who&s;e marks and character exactly agree with this prediction, let it be in what day or age of the world it will, they are the people intend|ed; and it may be expected, that when men leave the &s;criptures, and follow their own feel|ings and conceptions, they are not only in danger of being impo&s;ed upon; but often run into the highe&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m therefore to the law and te&s;timony. Now I leave you to make what reflections you plea&s;e upon it: while I proceed to another pa&s;&s;age of &s;criptue. Jude 3d ver&s;e. Beloved, when I gave all diligence
<PB N="99" REF="019212_0098_0FAA6687F21A1878">to write unto you, of the common &s;alvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you, that you &s;hould earne&s;tly contend for the faith, that was once delivered to the Saints, to wit, the &s;ame faith that the Apo&s;|tles had in the atoning blood and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to their doctrine and te&s;timony, which agrees with the prophet I&s;aiah, as recited above; to the law and to the te&s;timony &amp;c. And therefore there is no other law nor te&s;timony, nor faith, nor ever will be that God will own; till the final, and la&s;t appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; as you may &s;ee, II Thes. 1, 10, When he &s;hall come, to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; Becau&s;e our te&s;timony among you, was be|lieved in that day. Again, Jude 4th ver&s;e, But there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This agrees with II Peter 2, 1, Wherein they are called fal&s;e teachers, who &s;hould privily bring in damnable heri&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them|&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction. I believe, that turn|ing the grace of God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, is turning religion into baudy and balderda&s;h language and behaviour, which I have &s;een
<PB N="100" REF="019212_0099_0FAA6688AAB9BA98">and heard to an exce&s;&s;ive degree among you, enough to aba&s;h and da&s;h the countenances, of all mode&s;t people. Here ob&s;erve, the A|po&s;tle &s;ays, it was tho&s;e fal&s;e teachers, that turned the grace of God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s; and you &s;et up for teachers, and are found in the&s;e things. He &s;ays tho&s;e ungodly men crept in unawares, and it is true we were not aware of &s;uch things among you, when we fir&s;t join|ed you, nor had we then any idea, of &s;uch doctrines as you now hold forth, nor of &s;uch di&s;cipline, nor of &s;uch practices and behaviour &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and &s;cripture. And Peter &s;ays, tho&s;e fal&s;e teachers. &s;hould privily bring in damnable here&s;ies, to wit, doctrines contrary to &s;cripture, even denying the Lord that bought them. And I think, I have a|bundantly &s;hewn already, wherein you deny both God and Chri&s;t; but what is in you, as head or chief &s;ince the mother's death; why now elder James, I cannot &s;ee, but that you fall into this character, which if it be &s;o, you are in danger of &s;wift de&s;truction. For he that is able to characteri&s;e from ancient times, was able to tell the fate. Jude 8 ver&s;e, Likewi&s;e al&s;o the&s;e filthy dreamers defile the fle&s;h, de&s;|pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities; now whoever does the&s;e things, are the per|&s;ons or people intended: and by your for|bidding to marry, your people are become fil|thy dreamers, I certainly know, by my own
<PB N="101" REF="019212_0100_0FAA6689917AA3D0">experience, and by the frequent confe&s;&s;ions of others, for when nature is every other way re|&s;trained, it takes its cour&s;e that way, and be|comes habitual.</P>
<P>And again, it is natural for tho&s;e that &s;et them&s;elves up above all others, in power and dignity, to de&s;pi&s;e and &s;peak evil of them: which is beyond what Michael the Archan|gel, dared to do to the devil; ver&s;e 10. But the&s;e &s;peak evil of tho&s;e things which they know not; but what they know naturally as brute bea&s;ts; in tho&s;e things they corrupt them&s;elves. Peter &s;ays, and &s;hall utterly pe|ri&s;h in their own corruption; ver&s;e 11th. He pronounces a woe again&s;t them, and compares them with Cain, and Balaam and Core. Now elder James, I de&s;ire not to magnify, nor to mi&s;apply things, but certainly, Cain was a murderer, Balaam was after a reward, and Core was a gain&s;ayer: here the apo&s;tle Jude was pointing out a people, that are like them; but fir&s;t I would ob&s;erve, that love and hatred, are the greate&s;t marks of di&s;tinction between the children of God, and the children of the devil, as you may &s;ee I. John 3&mdash;15, who&s;o|ever hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him; but on the other hand I. John, 4&mdash;7, beloved let us love one another, for love is of God: and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. Now to
<PB N="102" REF="019212_0101_0FAA668A682BC870">take you as a people you are full of violent expre&s;&s;ions of hatred again&s;t all others, but your own &s;ect; and all &s;uch I think are of Cain's denomination; for their is no &s;uch thing as hating a brother or fellow creature in the kingdom of Chri&s;t: and he that hates feels like a murderer, and is &s;uch, and there|fore of Cain. But again, when you fir&s;t be|gan to call upon us to give up our e&s;tates to you, it was with this pretence, that the poor and the rich &s;hould all fare alike; but in&s;tead of that, the poor are neglected and much poorer than they were before, and you are living away upon what the rich bring in, and building a large ve&s;&s;el with it, and likely in|tend to carry off what you can get, and leave the poor to &s;hurk for them&s;elves. This I take to be running greedily after the error of Ba|laam for reward&mdash;concerning whom we read, II. Peter, 2&mdash;14, an heart they have, exer|ci&s;ed with covetous practices, cur&s;ed children, ver&s;e 15, which have for&s;aken the right way, and are gone a&s;tray, following the way of Balaam, the &s;on of Bo&s;er, who loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. But again, with re&s;pect to the gain&s;aying of Core, he ro&s;e up with his company, and &s;aid the congregation of the Lord was all holy; and it &s;eems did not in|cline to obey Mo&s;es and Aaron, but gain&s;ay|ed them. And now you are ri&s;en up with a company, &s;aying the congregation of the Lord
<PB N="103" REF="019212_0102_0FAA668AF2D67720">are all holy&mdash;meaning your own company, and are gain&s;aying Mo&s;es and Aaron, yea Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles too, and will not obey them, nor follow their lead; but are &s;et out for your|&s;elves another way. Again, ver&s;e 17, the&s;e are wells without water&mdash;clouds that are car|ried with a tempe&s;t, to whom the mi&s;t of dark|ne&s;s is re&s;erved forever: compared with Jude 13th ver&s;e, raging waves of the &s;ea foaming out their own &s;hame: wandering &s;tars, to whom is re&s;erved the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever. I think the&s;e wells without water, may be apt|ly applied to teachers without knowledge: and clouds carried with a tempe&s;t, to people driven on with the rapid &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m: and raging waves of the &s;ea foaming out their own &s;hame, to tho&s;e who&s;e religion con&s;i&s;ts much in anger and violence, and &s;hameful indecen&s;ies: and wandering &s;tars to tho&s;e who have departed from the law and te&s;timony of God&mdash;all which &s;o exactly re&s;embles what may abundantly be &s;een among you, that I can make no di&s;tinction: ver&s;e 14th, and E|noch al&s;o, the &s;eventh from Adam, prophe&s;ied of the&s;e, &amp;c. Again ver&s;e 16th, the&s;e are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lu&s;ts, and their mouth &s;peaketh great &s;welling words, having mens per&s;ons in ad|miration becau&s;e of advantage. Fir&s;t then, I &s;uppo&s;e that finding a great deal of fault and being often di&s;plea&s;ed, is to murmur and com|plain:
<PB N="104" REF="019212_0103_0FAA668D655933F8">and to eat and drink to exce&s;s, if that were all, is walking after their own lu&s;t: and great &s;welling words are bold, confident, pre|&s;umptuous expre&s;&s;ions: and to &s;hew more re&s;pect to the rich and honorable than to the poor and de&s;pi&s;ed, is an evidence of having their per&s;ons in admiration for &s;ome advan|tage thereby. Now elder James, I leave it to you, whether you do not &s;how more re&s;pect and take more pains to keep <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Jo&s;eph Ben|net, David Meechem, Jo&s;eph Merkum, Jere|miah Williard, David Hammon, and &s;uch like per&s;ons, than you have done to David Mudge, Thadius Hoburt, Ebenezer Davis, and Mo&s;es Crane&mdash;but you have lo&s;t the&s;e people, and they are gone off&mdash;this is as you &s;ay, beyond the bible, II. Tim. 3&mdash;1, this know al&s;o, that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come, that is, times of great danger&mdash;of people's being led away by de&s;igning men, under a pretence of religion, into what is expre&s;t, ver&s;e 2d, for men &s;hall be lovers of their own&s;elves, cove|tous, boa&s;ters, proud bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy. Now elder James, there is indeed a great appearance of love among your&s;elves, and of as much hatred to all others: and as to covetou&s;ne&s;s God will be your judge, but this is certain, that you do take away men's e&s;tates, and do not give to the poor neither; but con&s;ume it a|mong your&s;elves. And as to your being
<PB N="105" REF="019212_0104_0FAA668EDB3C03F0">proud, I really think there is the greate&s;t ap|pearance of pride, haughtine&s;s, &s;cornfulne&s;s, and di&s;dain, both in words and behaviour a|mong you, that I ever &s;aw in any profe&s;&s;ing people: and I think you are great boa&s;ters of your extraordinary gifts, of your pure and &s;en&s;ele&s;s lives, of your denial and cro&s;s, in all which you go not beyond others, as I can &s;ee, except it be in refraining women, which is but an error: in all other things, I think you take more liberty than people generally do, and in this view of your&s;elves, you look down up|on others with anger and di&s;dain, becau&s;e they do not do as you do, and be as good as you be. He next mentions bla&s;phemers, and I think for you to &s;et up the mother above Chri&s;t, as you really did, and &s;ince &s;he is dead, for you and your people, to &s;et your&s;elf up above Chri&s;t, as I take it you do, is bla&s;phe|my: and I think for you or any of you, to call every other God, and Chri&s;t, but what is in you the devil, old Belzebub, which you do, is al&s;o bla&s;phemy: and I think for you to cur&s;e the God that I wor&s;hipped, in plain and bold terms, as you have done, was al&s;o bla&s;|phemy. Then he &s;ays, di&s;obedient to parents: in your order the children of believing par|ents, mu&s;t obey their parents &s;o long as they can keep before them; but if the child out travels his parents, in your Judgment of the matter, the child takes the lead and govern|ment
<PB N="106" REF="019212_0105_0FAA668F6A0E0D60">of his parents, and that with great &s;eve|rity; But the children of unbelieving parents, mu&s;t win them over to the faith, or quit them, though they be under age, and again&s;t their parents will and commands, and ever after, treat them very villainou&s;ly in words e&s;peci|ally: and it may be ob&s;erved and known, that &s;uch children, are very unthankful to their parents, for any thing they ever received from them, and &s;uch I believe to be unholy as is &s;aid above. But again, ver&s;e 3d: Without natural affection, truce brakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, Incon&s;i&s;tent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good. Fir&s;t, it is an e&s;&s;ential article in your &s;y&s;tem of religion, to wholly de&s;troy and root out all natural affection: nor are they proper members of your community, till they are without natural affection; and then they be|come implacable, unmerciful, as you may &s;ee in the &s;ame words: Rom. 1, 31. Secondly, truce breakers, this is called Rom. 1, 21, co|venant breakers, and it is true you do break the mo&s;t &s;olemn covenants, between hu&s;bands and wives, which is apparent: and without doubt many between young men and maids, that lies hid, and it is a wonder, if many co|venants have not been broken by you, that Souls has made to &s;erve God, in a different way from this: and I think you do all in your power, to break the covenant of grace, and &s;et people to work, a one &s;ide of both law and
<PB N="107" REF="019212_0106_0FAA66902D5EF5B0">go&s;pel: and to depend upon you for &s;alvation. Thirdly, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, this is a general com|plaint again&s;t you, and what has &s;o univer&s;al|ly incenc&s;ed people again&s;t you, and when a|ny of you would get buffeted for it, you would call it per&s;ecution; when perhaps it was only for your faults. 4thly, Incon&s;i&s;tent, this is lu&s;ting, and take you as a people, I believe there is a con&s;tant raging, of lu&s;t among you, being prohibited all acce&s;s to women. And 5thly, fierce de&s;pi&s;ers, of tho&s;e that are good, now I think you cannot deny, but that you effect to be fierce, and if you di&s;cover any a|mong you, that are languid and low, you fall upon them and bounce them about, till you wake them up, and make them as fierce, as &s;o many red hot heaters; till you habituate them to it, and in this frame they become &s;uch fierce de&s;pi&s;ers of all others that are not of them, and like them; nor will you &s;uffer them to come &s;hort of this: and this you call your te&s;timony again&s;t the wicked and &s;in. But again 4th ver&s;e, Traitors, heady, high mind|ed, lovers of plea&s;ure, more than lovers of God. Fir&s;t then I remember, that when we come fir&s;t among you, &s;ome were &s;crupulous of confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins, for fear it would be known, you told them they need not fear for that, for you kept all clo&s;e, and never let the world know any thing of &s;uch matters; but &s;ince that you betray all tho&s;e &s;ecrets in ge|neral,
<PB N="108" REF="019212_0107_0FAA6690F56EB218">if not the particular per&s;ons: and it is very common for one brother or &s;i&s;ter to be|tray another to the church, and get them &s;e|verely cha&s;ti&s;ed, and they are encouraged in it, yea children are &s;crutinized by the church, and made to betray every thing they know a|gain&s;t their parents, which I have &s;een, and it looks to me like treachery. Again, 2dly, heady, high minded, viz. will have your way, being above, and knowing better than all o|thers, and this is true: for if you found out at any time, that any of us only thought by way of que&s;tion, in our own minds, whether you was right or not, in &s;uch or &s;uch a ca&s;e, you would be upon us like &s;o many lions, with cha&s;ti&s;ement: and this looks to me like being heady, and high minded. And again 3dly. Lovers of plea&s;ure more than lovers of God: agree all with this is that, Rom 1, 32, Who knowing the judgments of God, that they that commit &s;uch things, are worthy of death, not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them. From which it appears, that they took plea&s;ure in tho&s;e things, and in them that did them; and loved that more than they did God.</P>
<P>Therefore, whoever does the&s;e things them|&s;elves that are here &s;poken of by the apo&s;tle, and takes plea&s;ure in others that do the &s;ame, they are the per&s;ons intended, ver&s;e 5, having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power
<PB N="109" REF="019212_0108_0FAA6691AE4D16A0">thereof&mdash;from &s;uch al&s;o turn away, as if he &s;hould &s;ay, having an appearance of godline&s;s transformed into the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, pre|tending godline&s;s, and at the &s;ame time deny|ing the power and efficacy of Chri&s;t's go&s;pel for our &s;alvation: or that there is any power that can &s;ave &s;ouls, but what is in them&s;elves, from &s;uch turn away: ver&s;e 6th, for of this fort are they that creep into hou&s;es and lead captive &s;illy women, laden with &s;ins, and led away with divers lu&s;ts. Such women as the&s;e are ea&s;ily convicted of their dangerous &s;itua|tion, and are liable to be taken captive, and led away by tho&s;e that pretend to be perfect, able to bare their burdens and unlaid them of their &s;ins; and this is the craft of deceiv|ers, to creep into hou&s;es, working fir&s;t with the women, to get the man, and then the whole hou&s;e or family: as the Phili&s;tines fir&s;t wrought with Delilah to get Samp&s;on: and &s;o Titus 1&mdash;11, &s;ubvert whole hou&s;es, teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres &s;ake, or for their e&s;tates: ver&s;e 7th, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. This is the ca&s;e with your poor peo|ple, continually going for in&s;truction, and growing more ignorant, which differs entire|ly from what St. Paul tells us &s;hall be in the new covenant &s;tate: Hebrews 8&mdash;11, and they &s;hall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, know the
<PB N="110" REF="019212_0109_0FAA669269276A68">Lord, for all &s;hall know me, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t. Again, I. John, 2&mdash;27, but the anointing which ye have received of him a|bideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the fame anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it (mind as it) hath taught you, ye &s;hall abide in him. Again, Chri&s;t &s;ays, John 16&mdash;13, how be it, when the &s;pirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth&mdash;not you elder James. But to proceed, ver&s;e 8th, now as Jannes and Jambres with&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. Ob&s;erve here, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, that as they with&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o does the&s;e re&s;i&s;t the truth, which truth is what the prophets and apo&s;tles have wrote, and when the &s;pirit of truth comes in any one, it leads into all truth, that is into the volume of the &s;criptures, and gives him to &s;ee and feel the truth and reality of them, for when Chri&s;t comes, he comes ac|cording to &s;criptures, not to de&s;troy the law and prophets, and when he comes again, either by his &s;pirit to gather his elect, or per&s;onally to judgment, he will not de&s;troy his own go&s;|pel or mini&s;tration already given&mdash;and this you &s;ay is what we cannot be &s;aved by it, nei|ther yet by Chri&s;t, in a once crucified Chri&s;t; but you &s;ay we mu&s;t be &s;aved by faith in a Chri&s;t that is come in the mother. Hereby
<PB N="111" REF="019212_0110_0FAA6693714AF908">I &s;uppo&s;e you re&s;i&s;t the truth, for why could we not be &s;aved by a Chri&s;t come in any body el&s;e as well? the&s;e, the apo&s;tle &s;ays are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, which faith is that the apo&s;tle had, in a once crucified Chri&s;t. But to conclude:&mdash;with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t being come in you, there is nothing appears to make it evident; but to the contrary: and indeed there is no &s;uch thing as Chri&s;t's coming in the manner you pretend, &s;o long as there is any exalting them|&s;elves above God in his temple, for his com|ing will be their de&s;truction, as the ri&s;ing &s;un di&s;pels darkne&s;s. Another rea&s;on I would offer, and that is what the apo&s;tle Peter &s;peak|ing of Chri&s;t &s;ays, Acts 3&mdash;21, whom the heavens mu&s;t receive, until the times of re&s;|titution of all things. Again, I. Cor. 15&mdash;28, and when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Fir&s;t, we &s;ee not yet the re&s;titution of all things to their primitive rec|titude, until which time the heaven is to re|tain him. Again 2dly, all things are not yet &s;ubdued unto him, &s;eeing there are &s;o many u&s;urpers yet extant.</P>

I having been a profe&s;&s;or in the bap|ti&s;t order, for a number of years: at length, hearing of a &s;trange people at Ni&s;queuniah, about nine miles north we&s;t from Albany, and being previou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an opinion from certain pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, that about this time, Chri&s;t was to make his &s;econd appear|ance &s;ome where or other, and hoping it might be among them, I went to &s;ee them, and found a very &s;en&s;ible, religious people to appearance. They received and treated me very kindly, and after a while began &s;ome conver&s;ation, intimating they had attained the great and wonderful things, even the apo&s;tolic gifts. They &s;ang together after &s;haking awhile, and then the mother &s;pake in her unknown tongue: afterward came together and began to que&s;ti|on me, whether I thought I was born again or not? I &s;aid that I had a hope: they a&s;ked me if I did not commit &s;in&mdash;I did not deny it, then they took the bible and turned to that in John, he that is born of God, doth not com|mit &s;in: he that &s;inneth is of the devil: he that &s;ineth hath not &s;een him, neither knows him, &amp;c. and all with &s;uch a grace and &s;olem|nity, and I being ignorant, brought me to a pau&s;e: they pretended they were perfect, and &s;tood with Chri&s;t in full redemption: and that
<PB N="113" REF="019212_0112_0FAA66970442CE18">Chri&s;t had made his &s;econd appearance in them: and that they had the word of God, for all &s;uch as would believe in his &s;econd ap|pearing: had much talk this evening: the next day I took a kind leave of them, and re|turned home full of thoughts, and wondering at the &s;trange things that I had heard and &s;een. Soon after I made them another vi&s;it, when they taught me the nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, &s;hewing &s;cripture warrant for it, and ur|ged it upon me, as what they had all come into, in order to obtain repentance and &s;alva|tion from &s;in&mdash;in&s;inuating that if I would o|bey the word of God through them, I might &s;oon attain to the &s;ame great and glorious things. This being for what I knew what I was looking for, I complied, thinking it would do me no hurt if it did me no good, at the &s;ame time many others ran to &s;ee as I did, &amp; fell in, they pretended as I &s;aid, to have the &s;ame apo&s;tolic gifts, and there was &s;o much of a re&s;emblance, I knew not but that it might be &s;o, and there was the mo&s;t extraordinary appearance of love and union among them, that I ever &s;aw. I began to think I had found the people I was looking for, and the millen|nium was begun. We had now &s;et out for perfection, and began to forget our old reli|gion, and attend to the new lead: we had confe&s;&s;ed our &s;ins, and began to think our&s;elves better then others: felt very joyfull, inviting
<PB N="114" REF="019212_0113_0FAA66972EB3BBF8">everybody to come and go with us to Mount Zion. They &s;trictly enjoined it upon us to &s;earch our hearts, and make full confe&s;&s;ion of all former &s;ins, and to practice confe&s;&s;ions to them of all future &s;ins, of thought, word, and deed: and after a while, they began to teach us the nece&s;&s;ity of for&s;aking all for Chri&s;t, and to refrain from our wives, &s;aying, if ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die; but if ye through the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live. They &s;aid moreover, that the act of copulation was the forbidden fruit in the garden, which being taken, procured our fall and lo&s;s: this we al&s;o complied with, &s;till thinking that as we did more we grew better. All was yet calm and mild. After a while a-again, they taught us the nece&s;&s;ity of laying all at the apo&s;tle's feet&mdash;&s;hewing &s;cripture for it, and give up all to their di&s;po&s;al for the relief of the poor, &s;aying, let the brother of low de|gree rejoice in that he is exalted; and let the brother of high degree rejoice in that he is made low, refering to &s;cripture, which we could more ea&s;ily do, having given up our wives, we cared not much what became of all the re&s;t. By and by they began to dance: this &s;hocked me very much; but they read Jeremiah 31&mdash;13, then &s;hall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old toge|ther: &s;aying, this was that day. In a little time they carried tho&s;e dances into great fa|tigue
<PB N="115" REF="019212_0114_0FAA669862C72ED8">and labour, for the mortification of the fle&s;h. I began now to think I mu&s;tobey every command of God, in order to obtain perfecti|on; but they taught me to look wholly to them, who were the only lead of God for my &s;oul, as Mo&s;es was to the children of I&s;rael: they were for a time for what I could &s;ee, &s;trict in their morals, &s;evere in their di&s;cipline, and con&s;tant in their devotions. This looked to me to be right: I began to think we were the only people of God, and that the whole world lay in wickedne&s;s: we thought we obey|ed God, and therefore could not fail of find|ing acceptance with him: and that all others that did not do as we did, would certainly be lo&s;t. We were taught to believe in the mo|ther, and be obedient to our in&s;truction, and thereby we &s;hould believe in Chri&s;t, and obey him in his &s;econd appearing; they often quot|ing the&s;e words, that Chri&s;t was the author of eternal &s;alvation to all them that obey him, which was to obey the Mother, Chri&s;t being come in her, and by whom he &s;peaks to us, as the children of I&s;rael obeyed God in obeying Mo&s;es, by whom God &s;peaks to them, and her mini&s;tration being attended with vi&s;ions, revelations, unknown tongues, and prophe&s;y to all appearance as we accepted, we dared not but believe what they &s;aid, and that they were what they pretended to be: they often threat|nining or us with damnation, and the lo&s;s of
<PB N="116" REF="019212_0115_0FAA66988ACF6CF0">our &s;ouls, if we di&s;believed and di&s;obeyed them. This drew our attention to them in neglect of the bible, or any other God or Chri&s;t but what was in them, which was what they often &s;aid, and would in&s;i&s;t upon it, that there was no &s;aviour but what was in them: thus was I caught and carried away, believing it mu&s;t be right, and yet &s;ome how or other at length found it all gendered to bondage, and knew not how, for I had done my utmo&s;t, and meant to do it &s;till in obeying God; yet &s;uch trouble and di&s;tre&s;s would often come upon me, I knew not how, nor for what; but it felt like the bands of death: it would fir&s;t &s;et me a groaning, and as my di&s;tre&s;s increa&s;ed to hollowing, like a man void of rea&s;on; and after long enduring &s;uch things, I have gone to the church and told the mother how it was with me. She would &s;peak comfortably to me, and &s;end me into the dance, and hurry us round, and make us as jovial as po&s;&s;ible, and labour it off, and then re&s;ume great cheerful|ne&s;s again&mdash;and this became a general prac|tice to get rid of our burdens. I might not follow any teachings of God in my own &s;oul a one &s;ide of the mother's in&s;tructions, and I was taught by the elders, that God would not hear me no more than he would a devil: I mu&s;t go to the mother and elders, and they mu&s;t pray for me, and teach me; this had a tendency to cut me off from &s;eeking any where
<PB N="117" REF="019212_0116_0FAA66992D3C4E98">el&s;e but to them. I began now to be in great trouble at times, fearing all was not right; but I had got in, and could not get out: felt de|&s;olate and lo&s;t, and all I had now to build any hopes of &s;alvation upon, was my obedience to their in&s;tructions and orders; and the further I went the more I felt involved. Oh! what a bondman I have been in Egypt, and &s;hut up in Babylon, and could not get out: I began now to &s;u&s;pect I had mi&s;&s;ed my way to mount Zion, and come to Sinai, for I could hear lit|tle el&s;e but thunder and tempe&s;t: the &s;ound of a trumpet in the nature of it, and the voice of words: a fiery law and dreadful cur&s;es: old Pharoah &s;aying ye are idle, ye are idle, or in their own words, ye are &s;lothful, ye are &s;lothful, and if you are not a thou&s;and times more faithful then ever you have been, you will loo&s;e your &s;ouls: the whole tale of brick required, and no &s;traw given: perfection re|quired without grace: and we were beaten by &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, and my &s;oul groaned un|der cruel bondage, and the&s;e dreadful thun|derings from the church, and cha&s;ti&s;ements within it they &s;aid was God's roaring out of Zion, and I think uttering his voice from Je|ru&s;alem; and I did not know but that it was &s;o, till about two years after I fir&s;t joined them, when things that had lain hid began to ri&s;e and come to view, which I knew could not be good, and that gave me great doubts and
<PB N="118" REF="019212_0117_0FAA6699F9820FA8">fears concerning the whole of that religion, and then my troubles increa&s;ed: I was afraid to go forward or backward, for I had lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing I dared tru&s;t to, yea I was afraid to read the bible, or believe any thing of it. To follow a corrupt lead would be fatal, and to join with any &s;ect, looked to me like going back into Sodom. Here I &s;topped, like I&s;rael at the red &s;ea, and cried to God, nor could I help it then: yea my &s;oul cried to God day and night: many times in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, almo&s;t in di&s;traction &amp; de&s;pair, and dared not &s;tir one &s;tep, this way or that, by any detriment of mind, tho' I went &s;everal times after this to the church, which would but increa&s;e my trouble, for &s;eeing and hearing &s;uch things as I could not join with; I had been in great honour and re&s;pect among them, but was now fallen into contempt, my children ruled over me, and was &s;et on by the mother to cha&s;ti&s;e me: one e&s;pecially was made u&s;e of to reprove and cha&s;ti&s;e me open|ly and publickly for my coveteou&s;ne&s;s, in not giving up all I had to the church, and &s;ubmit|ing my&s;elf to their di&s;po&s;ition. Elder John Partington was &s;o hard upon me once in this matter, in a publick a&s;&s;embly, that he really &s;cared and terrified me, with &s;uch great and terrible words and threatnings; and &s;everal others I &s;uppo&s;ed were &s;et on by the mother to keep &s;louting and galling of me, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="119" REF="019212_0118_0FAA669AB3FE2288">to force me to a compliance. This indeed brought great trials upon me: I dared not go and &s;ell what I had and give it to them, ex|cept what came in victuals and cloathing, in which I &s;uppo&s;e I was not behind any. They were al&s;o as hard upon me to make me re|nounce all other religion but theirs, and every idea of any God or Chri&s;t, but what was in them; and al&s;o to renounce all that ever I experienced, as &s;omething in the old heavens. They di&s;approved of my reading the bible, driving things to a great extremity with great words and dreadful threatnings, which would make me like Job, almo&s;t, if not quite long for death. After &s;uch trials I have gone out into the woods and fell on my knees, and on my face, roaring and crying and telling God they were trying to force me to renounce him and deny Chri&s;t, which I dared not do, tho' I &s;hould die for it. They told me abundantly, that God would not hear my cries and prayers no more than he would a devil: to their terms I mu&s;t come, or go to hell.</P>
<P>Here I was held a long time in Babylon at the red &s;ea, and under Sinai's dreadful thun|ders, in the my&s;tery all at once, and felt my|&s;elf under Job's affliction: my friends that came to &s;ee me and labour with me being of this profe&s;&s;ion, who no doubt felt friendly to me, would read me off and condemn me, as Job's friends did him, and try to terrify and
<PB N="120" REF="019212_0119_0FAA669B6A07C7E8">per&s;uade me to renounce my old religion, ideas and notions of any other God or Chri&s;t than what was in the church; but my &s;oul held its integrity, and often cried out in the language of Job, though he &s;lay me yet will I tru&s;t in him. My breath, to wit, my words was &s;trange to my wife; my children were all as it were dead to me, being all in that religion and a|gain&s;t me: my worldly &s;ub&s;tance all gone from me as to any &s;atisfaction in it, or enjoyment of it as heretofore, &amp; tho' I had &s;een many things erroneous and ab&s;urd among them, yet I da|red not leave them in a profligate manner, nor re&s;ent any of their conduct; for I knew, be it as it might with others, it was God's hand upon me, every de&s;piteful word, and all the hard treatment I received from any, was God's hand upon me, and correction from God by them, he &s;uffering them &s;o to do, and all this was ju&s;t upon me: for I like the Galatians had left the faith of the go&s;pel, and was &s;eek|ing ju&s;tification by the works of the law. But this I did not then yet &s;ee, but was determin|ed to wait upon God, and die in Babylon or at the red &s;ea, in the &s;ituation I was then in, for I could go no further till God delivered me, which I had a mea&s;ure of faith to believe he would, in his own time and way: but after having through fear refrained reading the bible &s;ome time, and my troubles increa&s;ing, one day being in my hou&s;e, and looking towards
<PB N="121" REF="019212_0120_0FAA669C2A0003A0">the bible, thought with my&s;elf, O! how I u&s;ed to love that book; but now I am afraid of it, and afraid of every thing, all is lo&s;t, and I am lo&s;t, and know not where to go; but thought again, I will go and take the bible and read, let come of it what will: and as God would have it, when I come to open the book and read, I found it &s;pake to me, and into me, de&s;cribing the &s;tate of my &s;oul, and &s;peaking the language of my heart, my &s;oul had fel|low&s;hip with it, and I knew that I was in the &s;ame travel that they had been in that wrote; I &s;en&s;ibly felt virtue and life from their words: now I again knew the bible was true; and my &s;oul felt &s;uch a deliverance, that I could not read for crying, with love and joy and thankfulne&s;s to God, for his mercy to &s;uch a poor lo&s;t &s;oul. I could &s;carce read any where, but it &s;eemed to be new to me, and life in it; and I could &s;carce read a &s;entence, before I &s;hould bur&s;t out a crying again, with joy and thankfulne&s;s and love to God: it would &s;peak &s;o right into my &s;oul, and my &s;oul in the word, becoming one with it as Chri&s;t &s;ays, I in you, and you in me, that is his word abid|ing in us, and we abiding in his word, having fellow&s;hip with him, in and by his word. Here I found joy and peace in believing: I began now to try to recover my family again, to an adherance to the bible, which at length &s;uc|ceeded&mdash;who all came off with me, except my elde&s;t daughter, who was &s;ent away at a great
<PB N="122" REF="019212_0121_0FAA669EA08875F0">di&s;tance from the church, perhaps to keep her out of the way. Now I &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of believing and obeying the &s;crip|tures: particularly the words of Chri&s;t, con|cerning fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e prophets, that &s;hould ari&s;e and &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders, and if it were po&s;&s;ible, deceive the very elect: and al&s;o of tho&s;e that &s;hould cry lo here is Chri&s;t, and lo there: he &s;ays believe them not: go not after them; but thro' incon&s;i|deration and di&s;obedience to the command of Chri&s;t, I went after them, and believed them, that Chri&s;t was come in them, and that the kingdom of God was come in them, when I ought to have looked for it, and found it in my own heart. Here I believe God gave me &s;orrow and repentance for departing from God, and putting confidence in creatures that could neither &s;ave them&s;elves, nor them that tru&s;ted in them. Here God was plea&s;ed to divide the red &s;ea of Chri&s;t's blood, and open a way of redemption for my &s;oul through faith in his blood, giving me to &s;ee the line of grace in di&s;tinction from the line of works, that I had been led along in under the old covenant and a broken law, where there was no po&s;&s;ible &s;alvation, till we were &s;lain by it: Rom. 7&mdash;11, and become dead to it: Gal. 2&mdash;19, and wholly divorced from it: Rom. 7&mdash;3, and made alive through faith, in that all atoning blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who became the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to all them that believe: nor is the be&s;t doings
<PB N="123" REF="019212_0122_0FAA669FCC8D45A8">that ever man did or can do, &s;ince the go&s;pel day, in order thereby to attain life and ju&s;ti|fication before God, any better, than if he had cut off a dog's neck, or offered &s;wines blood: I&s;aiah 66&mdash;3, and it is an infallible evidence, that he that is at work for life, has not got it, nor can he obtain it in that way, for this wholly &s;ets Chri&s;t a&s;ide, and invali|dates the go&s;pel: and this was the ca&s;e: Rom. 9&mdash;31, but I&s;rael which followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s hath not attained to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Ver&s;e 32d. Wherefore? becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for they &s;tum|bled at that &s;tumbling &s;tone. Again, Rom. 10&mdash;3, for they being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is become ours by imputation, through our faith in him, and this is certainly the ca&s;e of the&s;e people called Shakers: they are en|deavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;|ne&s;s by their own works, and yet come &s;o &s;hort of it, as to fall into great abominations. Their whole dependance is upon their own doings for &s;alvation: not &s;o much as one word &s;aid about what Chri&s;t has done and &s;uf|fered for us, among them; but it is what they them&s;elves do, and the mother and elders &s;uffer for them: and &s;ince her death, they ex|pect
<PB N="124" REF="019212_0123_0FAA669FF141FC40">to &s;uffer for their own &s;ins, till they have paid the la&s;t nite: and the more they &s;uffer here, the le&s;s they &s;hall &s;uffer in hell or purga|tory, before they come out again: and if any attain to perfection here in this life, it mu&s;t be by &s;o much greater degrees of &s;ufferings, and in this belief, they put them&s;elves to all the hard&s;hips, fatigues and &s;ufferings, they are po&s;&s;ibly able to endure&mdash;and all this in order to obtain &s;alvation, not expecting of it in any other way: and this is their new heaven's &s;tate, which is wholly under the law of works, and entirely excludes Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, &s;ee Gal. 5&mdash;4, Chri&s;t is become of no effect unto you, who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the law, ye are fallen from grace. Again, Gal. 2&mdash;16, knowing that a man is not ju&s;ti|fied by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we may be ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t, and not by the works of the law, for by the works of the law &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified. Again, for as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e. Here I &s;ay God &s;hewed me the legal line, where there was no &s;alvation; for the law made nothing perfect, Heb. 7, 19. Again, Gal. 3, 21, for if there had been a law given, that could have given life, verily righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hould have been by the law. Again, Gal, 2, 21, for if righteou&s;ne&s;s came by the law, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain. By all which
<PB N="125" REF="019212_0124_0FAA66A0AFFB0908">it is evident, that all they that are at work, in what way or manner &s;oever, expecting &s;alva|tion by it, are under the law, and under the cur&s;e. Here I &s;aw therefore there was no righteou&s;ne&s;s or perfection to be attained by the law, or by our own works; and all that I had done &s;ince I joined the&s;e people, or could po&s;&s;ibly do, was no better then dro&s;s and dung, and that if ever any &s;oul was &s;av'd, it would be by free grace, and not for works of right|eou&s;ne&s;s that we have done; but of his own mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regener|ation, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;be|ing ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The old covenant was a covenant of works, which all mankind are under by nature, and condemned to death; but the new covenant was a covenant of grace&mdash;grace is the joyful &s;ound to every new condemned criminal, and ble&s;&s;ed are the people that know it. Grace is the e&s;&s;ence of the go&s;pel, its nature is to ran|&s;om and redeem, breaks every yoke and &s;ets the pri&s;oners free&mdash;it be&s;tows freely wine and milk, without money and without price&mdash;&amp; it is by grace we are &s;aved through faith, and that not of our&s;elves, it is gift of God&mdash;not of works, lea&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t, Eph. 2&mdash;8&mdash;9. Grace is free mercy and love of God to a lo&s;t world, in giving his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. Grace pro|cures

Grace makes us feel our dependence, and to value Chri&s;ts blood; grace is the whole theme of them that are &s;aved; by grace, in all their thank offerings and prai&s;es, they bring forth Chri&s;t the head &s;tone with &s;houting, crying grace, grace unto it, Zach. 4, 7, not that the new covenant doctrines of grace and faith, de&s;troys the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience to the com|mands of God, for Chri&s;t &s;ays, I come not to de&s;troy the law and the prophets, but to ful|fill; and St. Paul &s;ays, do we then make void the law through faith, God forbid, ye we e&s;ta|bli&s;h the law; but here is the defect among all the unregenerate, they do not love God, and therefore do not obey him, all that they do in the outward form of obedience, is from &s;elf and to &s;elf, and not to God, and what he he does is that he might find favour and ac|ceptance of God by it; and to obtain life; but the renewed &s;oul obeys from the heart, becau&s;e he loves God, and loves his commands;
<PB N="127" REF="019212_0126_0FAA66A22A67C238">for no more does any one love God, then he loves his commands; hence David &s;ays, O! how love I thy law; and St. Paul &s;ays, I de|light in the law of God after the inward man; and this they do, becau&s;e they have obtained life; and from life, and the nature of God in them; which only is obedience, in the &s;en&s;e of the commands; again, here is another blun|der men make, they think becau&s;e God com|mands, they mu&s;t obey; and &s;o they mu&s;t or be lo&s;t, except Chri&s;t obeys for them, and when they think they have obeyed, they think they &s;hall be excepted; But alas! they have broke the law already, and the &s;entence is pa&s;t a|gain&s;t them, and die they mu&s;t do what they can now, except through faith in Chri&s;t's dy|ing for them, they be acquitted: for this is true, he died for all, and has fulfilled and an|&s;wered the demands of the law, both in it's preceptive, and penal part, by his active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, for all his elect: and they are thereby acquitted; nor has the law any demands upon them for they are dead to it; agreeable to Rom. 7, 4, Therefore my brethren ye are become dead to the law by the body of Chri&s;t. This was a wonderful deliverance to my &s;oul, when God was plea&s;ed to open it unto me, and make it mine; I &s;aw and felt too, that I was become dead to the law, by that crucified bo|dy of Chri&s;t; that it had its whole demand of him for me, that he had kept it for me, and &s;uffered the penalty due to me, and I had no|thing to do, but to believe and tru&s;t in him,
<PB N="128" REF="019212_0127_0FAA66A314451258">and love and obey him forever. Again, Rom. 5, 10, for if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his &s;on, much more being reconciled, we &s;hall be &s;av|ed by his life; here I &s;aw, that it was the death of Chri&s;t, that reconciled us to God, and no|thing of our own doings; and that our whole &s;alvation depends upon the life of Chri&s;t; and becau&s;e he lives we &s;hall live al&s;o; John 4, 19, here I can &s;ay ble&s;&s;ed be God, I knew what it was to cat the fle&s;h of the Son of Man, and drink his blood by faith, as really and &s;en&s;ibly, as e|ver my body fed on temporal food, and &s;ound strength and nouri&s;hment thereby: his fle&s;h was meat indeed, and his blood was drink indeed, which my &s;oul fed on by faith: for this fle&s;h and blood of Chri&s;t was the &s;acri|fice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> that made peace, and reconciled God and man again, and is the bread of life to the &s;oul of the believer, as appears John 6&mdash;51, I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he &s;hall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my fle&s;h, which I will give for the life of the world. Here is therefore full and free redemption, and who&s;oever does really believe the&s;e things does feel his &s;oul &s;aved. As Chri&s;t &s;ays, he that believes &s;hall be &s;aved. Thus when God was plea&s;ed to recover me again to the faith of the go&s;pel, I felt my &s;oul enter in|to re&s;t, and cea&s;ed from its own works, as we read Heb. 4, 3, For we which have believed, do enter into re&s;ts as he &s;aid &amp;c. Again, ver&s;e 10th. For he that is en|tered into his re&s;t, he al&s;o hath cea&s;ed from his own works, as God did from his. And this was the coming of Chri&s;t the kingdom of God, and the millennium be|gan in my &s;oul, which I had been trying to find; but could not by ob&s;ervation, or the works of the law. And now to conclude, in the words of King Je&s;us, Rev. 2, 2, I know thy works and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou can&s;t not bear them which are evil, and thou ha&s;t tried them, which &s;ay they are Apo&s;tles and are not, and ha&s;t found them liars.&mdash;</P>
