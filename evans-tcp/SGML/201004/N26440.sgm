<HEAD>&sect;. 1.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ten pages of the following FRAGMENTS will, probably, be thought the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of this little work. They exhibit a rude and imperfect &s;ketch of the <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory-Picture</HI> in the neighbourhood of Phi|ladelphia: a picture which, if it were drawn by an able hand, could not fail to prove intere&s;ting to the lovers of &s;cience, in every part of the world. Each of the&s;e pages is divided into five columns. The fir&s;t re&s;pects the day of the month when the birds mentioned in the &s;econd column arrived, or were <HI>fir&s;t &s;een,</HI> in the vicinity of Philadel|phia. In the &s;econd column, I have given what may be called the &s;cientific Latin name of each bird. In this part of my &s;ubject, I have always preferred the name of Linnaeus, when I could di&s;cover that the bird had been de&s;cribed by this great naturali&s;t. But &s;everal of the birds, which are here mentioned, were not known to Linnaeus: at lea&s;t, I do not find that they have a place in any of the editions of his immortal work, the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI> I have, therefore, been obliged to adopt other names, and, in a few in&s;tances, to impo&s;e them my&s;elf. I have often adopted the names of Profe&s;&s;or Gmelin, the laborious, and often &s;ucce&s;sful, editor of the new edition of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed at Leip&s;ie, in 1788.</NOTE> When this is the ca&s;e, I have affixed to the &s;cientific name, the letter G, thus (G.) I have in this co|lumn, &s;ometimes made u&s;e of the &s;cientific names of my ingenious and good friend, Mr. William Bartram, a gentleman who has contributed much to our knowledge of the natural productions of North-America. To the names which I my&s;elf have impo&s;ed, I have affixed the word (mihi.) But I by no means pretend to a&s;&s;ert, that all the birds thus marked are new, or have not been de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. II.</HEAD>
<P>In the third column, I have given the Engli&s;h &s;cientific and the Engli&s;h provincial names. The former are chiefly taken from the <HI>Arctic Zoology</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;econd edition. London: 1792.</NOTE> of my excellent friend Mr. Pennant, becau&s;e this is a work of &s;uch exten&s;ive merit, that I pre&s;ume it is in the hands of almo&s;t every naturali&s;t; and becau&s;e the names impo&s;ed by this gentleman are, with a very few exceptions, ju&s;t and &s;ignificant. By the Engli&s;h provincial names, I mean the names by which the&s;e birds are be&s;t known in Penn&s;ylvania, and in various other parts of the United-States. The&s;e provincial names are always enclo&s;ed within a parenthe&s;is, as in the in&s;tances (Pewe), (Turtle-Dove), &amp;c. They are de&s;ignated in the &s;ame manner in the li&s;t of Re&s;ident Birds, &amp;c. in Section III. The greater number of the&s;e names are u&s;ed in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. III.</HEAD>
<P>The fourth column relates to the "Progre&s;s Vegetation." The greater number of the vegetables which I have here enumerated are natives of Penn&s;ylvania. Some, which are not natives of this &s;tate, are natives of other parts of the United-States; whil&s;t others have not, hitherto, been found to grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in any part of America. In general, the plants are de&s;ignated by their Linnaean names. In a few in&s;tances, I have adopted the names of the late Mr. Aiton, in his <HI>Hortus Kewen&s;is;</HI> tho&s;e of Mar&s;hall, and other botani&s;ts. All the plants which I have men|tioned are found, either wild, or growing in gardens, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, where the remarks on the time of their flowering and lea&s;ing have been made.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t column contains "Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations." In this part of my Sketches, I have done but very little. Want of time has prevented me from throwing into this column, many intere&s;ting facts, &s;ome of which will be pre&s;ented, perhaps to greater advantage, to the public, in my future publications. The few Ther|mometrical
<PB N="vi" REF="035159_0005_10012A6899289CE0">and Barometrical ob&s;ervations, which occur under this head, are given on the authority of my ever|venerated maternal uncle, the late David Rittenhou&s;e, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> The&s;e ob&s;ervations were made in Philadelphia.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. V.</HEAD>
<P>It mu&s;t not be imagined, that I communicate the&s;e &s;ketches to the public as exhibiting even the names of <HI>all</HI> the migratory birds of Penn&s;ylvania. I am per&s;uaded, that <HI>many</HI> of the&s;e birds have e&s;caped my notice. This is, per|haps, e&s;pecially the ca&s;e with the birds of the genera Anas, Tringa, and of the exten&s;ive order of Pa&s;&s;eres, &amp;c. which I &s;u&s;pect are con&s;tant in their migrations from the north to the &s;outh, and from the &s;outh to the north. A good many of the birds which are mentioned by Mr. Pennant as natives of New-York have not hitherto, to my knowledge, been ob&s;erved in Penn&s;ylvania: but it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e &s;pecies which are <HI>common</HI> in New-York (if we except &s;uch as delight in the vicinity of the &s;ea-coa&s;t) are <HI>uncommon,</HI> or never &s;een, in Penn&s;yl|vania. Here, however, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I cannot but &s;u&s;pect, that Mr. Pennant, Mr. Latham, and other able ornithologi&s;ts, have &s;ometimes de&s;cribed as di&s;tinct &s;pecies, birds which merely differ in &s;ex, or in age, and in their colouring, for which the&s;e animals, at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, are &s;o remarkable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the con&s;tant migratory birds, there are others, which may be denominated <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> migratory, or vi&s;it|ant, birds of Penn&s;ylvania. Such, not to mention &s;everal others, are the Columba pa&s;&s;erina, or Ground-Pigeon, the Fringilla bicolor, or Bahama-Finch, and a &s;pecies of P&s;ittacus, or Parrot.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. VII.</HEAD>
<P>The two fir&s;t of the&s;e birds were &s;een in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, between thirty and forty years ago. The P&s;ittacus, mo&s;t probably the P&s;ittacus pertinax, Illinois Parrot, or the P&s;ittacus carolinen&s;is, Carolina Parrot, has been occa&s;ionally ob&s;erved in Shareman's Valley, on Shareman's Creek, a branch of the river Su&s;quehanna, within twenty miles of the town of Carli&s;le.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of mine has informed me, that the Parakeet &s;een in this valley is the &s;ame &s;pecies which is frequently met with in the neighbourhood of the river Ohio. This La&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to be P&s;ittacus pertina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> This la&s;t fact &s;eems to contradict the ob&s;ervation of Mr. William Bartram, who &s;ays, "The parakeet (P&s;ittacus carolinen&s;is) never reach &s;o far north as Penn&s;ylvania, which to me is unaccountable, con&s;idering they are a bird of &s;uch &s;ingular rapid flight, they could ea&s;ily perform the jour|ney in ten or twelve hours from North-Carolina, where they are very numerous, and we abound with all the fruits which they delight in."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida, &amp;c.

Vol. 1. P. 285.</NOTE> My ob&s;ervation is an additional objection to the hypothe&s;is. I may add, that a very large flight of parakeets, which came from the we&s;tward, was &s;een, a few years ago, about twenty-five miles to the north-we&s;t of Albany, in the &s;tate of New-York. The arrival of the&s;e birds in the depth of winter<NOTE N="&verbar;" PLACE="foot">In January, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> was, indeed, a very remarkable circum&s;tance. The more ignorant Dutch &s;ettlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful con&s;ternation, that it portended nothing le&s;s calamitous than the de&s;truction of the world.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">This fact was communicated to me by Egbert Ben&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the State of New-York.</NOTE></P>

<P>I &s;u&s;pect it will be found, that, in general, our &s;outhern birds migrate farther north in the tract of country we&s;t than in that ea&s;t of the great ranges of our mountains. With re&s;pect to the birds, I hazard this merely as a con|jecture:
<PB N="vii" REF="035159_0006_10012A6A39FE09F0">but it is a conjecture which derives &s;upport from many intere&s;ting facts which I have collected, and which will be mentioned and explained in my <HI>Geographical View of the Trees and Shrubs of North-America.</HI> In that work, I &s;hall &s;how, that the &s;outhern trees and &s;hrubs (that is, tho&s;e vegetables which attain to their greate&s;t perfection in the &s;outhern climates of our continent, particularly of the United-States) are, in general, found much farther north in the we&s;tern than they are in the ea&s;tern parts of our country. This fact &s;eems to &s;how, and the point is put beyond any manner of doubt, by thermometrical ob&s;ervations, that the we&s;tern climate, in the &s;ame lati|tudes, is more temperate than the ea&s;tern. Of cour&s;e, it were natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;outhern birds, to whom heat is &s;o genial, would often be &s;olicited farther north in the we&s;tern than in the ea&s;tern di&s;trict. This, with re&s;pect to &s;ome birds, is actually the ca&s;e. Mr. Jeffer&s;on has ob&s;erved, that "Perroquets even winter on the Sioto, in the 39th degree of latitude."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the State of Virginia. Page 139. The original edition.</NOTE> I have certain information, that the&s;e birds winter &s;till farther north than is here mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. IX.</HEAD>
<P>Birds, in migrating, are fond of following the cour&s;es of rivers, and other large &s;treams of water. This circum|&s;tance, in my opinion, partly explains the rea&s;on, why &s;ome of the birds of the &s;outhern parts of the United-States, and al&s;o &s;ome of the South-American birds, which have never, or very rarely, been di&s;covered in the Atlantic coun|tries of North-America, are not uncommon in the countries we&s;t of the Alleghaney-Mountains. The&s;e &s;outhern birds, following the cour&s;es of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and its branches (the Ohio, the Illinois, &amp;c.) are &s;pread or di&s;per&s;ed through the rich and exten&s;ive territories that are wa&s;hed by the&s;e waters. Whether or not this explanation be admitted, the fact is certainly as I have &s;tated; and to the naturali&s;t it cannot but appear intere&s;ting. The P&s;ittacus pertinax is one of the birds of Bra&s;il; and the Mu&s;cicapa Tyrannus, which is held in &s;o much e&s;teem by the Nau|dowe&s;&s;ies, and other we&s;tern Indian tribes, is a native of Surinam, and of the country bordering on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> river Plata.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. X.</HEAD>
<P>It is, I think, in general, a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that our Spring and Summer birds of pa&s;&s;age continue with us about &s;ix months, and are ab&s;ent for the &s;ame length of time. Accordingly, tho&s;e birds which arrive early in the &s;pring di&s;appear early in the autumn, and tho&s;e which arrive late in the &s;pring do not di&s;appear until late in the au|tumn. Our late &s;prings are commonly &s;ucceeded by late and warm autumns, which, by keeping alive the numerous &s;pecies of in&s;ects, which are the favourite food of almo&s;t all our &s;ummer birds of pa&s;&s;age, detain the&s;e birds for a con&s;iderable time among us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XI.</HEAD>
<P>The greater number of the Spring and Summer birds of pa&s;&s;age, which I have mentioned, build and breed in Penn&s;ylvania.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. where I have de&s;ignated with an a&s;teri&s;k (*) tho&s;e birds which <HI>are known</HI> to breed in Penn&s;ylvania. The greater number of them thus marked breed within a few miles of Philadelphia.</NOTE> Perhaps, they all breed in &s;ome part of this exten&s;ive &s;tate, with the exception of the Vultur Aura (Turkey-Buzzard), and a few others, which do not vi&s;it us until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ummer. It has lately been a&s;certained, that the Ampelis Garrulus, or Prib-Chatterer (Cedar-Bird) does breed in Penn&s;ylvania; and I doubt not, that the &s;ame will, in time, be di&s;covered to be the ca&s;e with the Emberiza Oryzivora (Rice-Bird, Reed-Bird), and others who&s;e ne&s;ts have not hitherto been &s;een in Penn&s;ylvania. It is not unlikely, however, that &s;ome of the&s;e birds of pa&s;&s;age continue their migration farther northward, to New-York, New-England, Vermont, &amp;c. and there breed and rai&s;e their young, returning &s;outhward, through Penn&s;ylvania, in the fall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XII.</HEAD>
<P>It is an intere&s;ting fact, for which we are indebted to Mr. William Bartram, that very few of our birds of pa&s;&s;age from the &s;outh "build or rear their young in the &s;outh or maritime parts of Virginia and Carolina, Georgia and
<PB N="viii" REF="035159_0007_10012A6FD88C1E60">Florida."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, &amp;c. Page 287.</NOTE> This circum&s;tance leads to a &s;u&s;picion, that the principal cau&s;e (I will not, out of complai&s;ance to any one, call it a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tinct) which leads or impels the&s;e birds to migrate to the northward, is that they may make choice of a proper climate, abounding in their favourite food, to perform their amours, to build their ne&s;ts, and to rear their young. Much light might be thrown upon this curious &s;ubject, if natural hi&s;tory were cultivated in the United-States, with a portion of that innocent and u&s;eful zeal with which it is cultivated in Europe: with only a &s;mall portion of that ardent zeal which &s;o &s;trongly characterizes the Americans in their pur&s;uit of gain. But, as yet, little attention is paid to the &s;tudy of nature in the United-States. In our colleges, it is not taught as an indi&s;pen|&s;able branch of polite or u&s;eful knowledge, but is obliged to yield its laurels to languages which are withered or dead, and to &s;tudies which are u&s;ele&s;s or ignoble.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I ever have been a friend to the &s;tudy of the two ancient languages, the Greek and the Latin, which are taught in our &s;chools. They are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the complete attainment of &s;ome &s;ciences, &s;uch as natural hi&s;tory (including botany), and medicine; and I think with Era&s;mus, that a phy&s;ician &s;hould he a&s;hamed not to know them. But too much time is di&s;&s;ipated in the acqui&s;ition of the&s;e languages. If I do not greatly mi&s;take, this truth begins to be acknowledged among us. <HI>Video mediora.</HI> If only one-&s;ixth part of the time which is con&s;umed in acquiring the Greek and Latin languages (particularly the former), were appropriated to the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory, in le&s;s than twenty years, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral productions of the United-States would be pretty well inve&s;tigated. But what, in the cultivation of a &s;cience &s;o exten&s;ive, and &s;o difficult, can be expected from the labours of two or three individuals, unaided by the public, and tra|melled by profe&s;&s;ional engagements and pur&s;uits?</NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that many of the birds which I have enumerated, pa&s;s, on their return to the &s;outh, during the autumnal months, through the countries which are &s;ituated to the we&s;t of the great ranges of our mountains. That this is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, I do not doubt: but it is not the general order of the migration of our birds. My opinion, indeed, is oppo&s;ed by the authority of &s;ome very re&s;pectable naturali&s;ts, who&s;e &s;entiments de&s;erve to be mentioned in this place. "The birds (&s;ays the late Mr. George Edwards), which pa&s;s through the country north|ward in the &s;pring, being never ob&s;erved to return the &s;ame way, Mr. Bartram &s;uppo&s;es that they go to the &s;outhward in autumn by &s;ome other pa&s;&s;age beyond their inland mountains."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gleanings of Natural Hi&s;tory, Part II. P. 202.</NOTE> This notion is likewi&s;e adopted by Mr. Pennant-Speaking of the Motacilla vermivora, or Worm-eater, this able zoologi&s;t &s;ays, "It does not appear in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> till <HI>July,</HI> in its pa&s;&s;age northward. Does not return the &s;ame way; but is &s;uppo&s;ed to go beyond the mountains which lie to the we&s;t. This &s;eems to be the ca&s;e with all the tran&s;ient vernal vi&s;itants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI>"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tic Zoology VOL. II. P. 100, 101.</NOTE> In the above quotation, Mr. Edwards &s;ays, the birds are "never" ob&s;erved to return the &s;ame way that they went. This is, certainly, a mi&s;take. Our &s;wallows, which are migratory birds, as I think I have rendered very probable in the Appendix,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Page 16.</NOTE> are generally &s;een on their return &s;outhward, in the autumn, far to the ea&s;t of the fir&s;t ranges of our mountains. But independently of the &s;wallows, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of many other &s;pecies of birds. Indeed, I believe it may confidently be &s;aid, that mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;enger-birds, which pa&s;s by us, in the &s;pring, return, in the autumn, &s;outhward, the &s;ame way they went. This ob&s;ervation certainly applies to the Anas canaden&s;is (Wild-Goo&s;e), the Columba migratoria (Wild-Pigeon), the Fringilla tri&s;tis (Yellow-Bird), Motacilla Sialis (Blue-Bird), Loxia Curviro&s;tra (Cro&s;sbill), Fringilla &mdash; (Hemp-Bird), and at lea&s;t fifty others, which are <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> ob&s;erved on their migrations &s;outhward, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. The&s;e autumnal flocks &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of many thou&s;ands of individuals together; and it has been ob&s;erved, that birds of different &s;pecies &s;ometimes mi|grate in the &s;ame bodies.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t not be imagined, that the birds which I have enumerated arrive uniformly, every year, at the times which are prefixed to their names, in the fir&s;t column. I have long been per&s;uaded, that the uniformity of the ar|rival of the migratory birds, in any given country, is not &s;o great as many naturali&s;ts have imagined. The atten|tion which I have paid to this curious &s;ubject in Penn&s;ylvania, has convinced me, that my &s;u&s;picion was well founded. The migration of birds is not a "determinate in&s;tinct,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Adam Fergu&s;on.</NOTE> but an act of volition, or will. Hence, the &s;ea&s;ons and
<PB N="ix" REF="035159_0008_10012A73E3E98AE0">other circum&s;tances will greatly regulate the arrival of birds in, and their flight or removal from, a particular country. Sometimes, there is a difference of three weeks or a month between the arrival, or appearance, of the &s;ame &s;pecies, in two different years. This will appear from the following in&s;tances, which are &s;elected from many others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XV.</HEAD>
<P>From an in&s;pection of the&s;e Tables, it will appear, that the Alauda alpe&s;tris, or Shore-Lark, the Alauda rubra, or Red-Lark, the Fringilla tri&s;tis, or Golden Finch, and &s;ome others, were not ob&s;erved, in the vicinity of Phila|delphia, earlier than the twelfth of March, 1791: whereas the &s;ame birds were &s;een, in the &s;ame neighbourhood, as early as the twenty-eighth of February, the following year, on their pa&s;&s;age northward.</P>
<P>I have placed the Anas canaden&s;is (Wild-Goo&s;e) between the 15th and the 18th of April, 1791, but in the year 1794, the&s;e birds were ob&s;erved, on their migration from the &s;outh, as early as the 3d of March. In the fir&s;t men|tioned year the Ardea Herodias, or Great Heron, was not ob&s;erved before the 15th or 16th of April; but in the latter year, numbers of the&s;e birds were &s;een as early as the 1&s;t of April. Many other in&s;tances might be mentioned.</P>

<P>How much the movements of birds from one country to another depend upon the &s;tate of the &s;ea&s;ons, will ap|pear from different parts of this little work; particularly from the Third Section. Here we find, that during our mild winters, &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;pecies of birds which, in general, are undoubtedly migratory, continue the winter through in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. Such, which I have denominated the OCCASIONAL, or ACCI|DENTAL, RESIDENT BIRDS, are the Ardea Herodias, or Great Heron, Columba carolinen&s;is, or Turtle-Dove, the Fringilla melodia, and &s;everal others: I doubt not many more than I have mentioned. The Columba migratoria, Pa&s;&s;enger-Pigeon, commonly returns from the northward late in the fall, and continues with us a few days, or weeks, feeding in our fields upon the &s;eed of the buckwheat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polygum F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pyrum.</NOTE> or in the woods upon acorns. But if the &s;ea&s;on be a very mild one, they continue with us for a much longer time. This was the ca&s;e in the winter of 1792&mdash;1793, when immen&s;e flocks of the&s;e birds continued about the city, and did not migrate farther &s;outhward, until the weather became more &s;evere in the month of January. The winter of 1792&mdash;1793, was one of the milde&s;t that had ever been remembered in Penn&s;ylvania. It is a common ob&s;ervation in &s;ome parts of this &s;tate, that when the Pi|geons continue with us all the winter, we &s;hall have a &s;ickly &s;ummer and autumn. There is, perhaps, &s;ome foun|dation for this notion. Large bodies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay "large bodies," for I believe individuals of tho&s;e birds continue with us almo&s;t every winter.</NOTE> of the&s;e birds &s;eldom do winter among us unle&s;s the winter be very mild; and the experience of &s;ome years has taught us, that &s;uch winters are often followed by malignant epidemics. The mild winter of 1792&mdash;1793, was &s;ucceeded by a dreadful malignant fever, which de&s;troyed between four and five thou&s;and people in Philadelphia; and I am a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;ame fever in 1762 was preceded by an extremely open winter, during which the pigeons remained about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the &s;tate. In the hands of a poet, a Lucretius, or a Virgil, this coincidence between the accidental hiemation of the pigeons and the appearance of the yellow-fever might be wrought up into a &s;y&s;tem of beautiful extravagance.</P>

<P>If birds, in their migration from one country to another, were impelled by a "determinate," or nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tinct, the periods of their arrival and departure would be more uniform and fixed. But we have &s;een, that there is a con&s;iderable difference in the&s;e re&s;pects, even in two years immediately in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Such great regularity in the migrations of the&s;e animals by no means accords with tho&s;e accommodating habits, which the naturali&s;t di&s;covers in his inve&s;tigation of the manners of all animals; tho&s;e habits which have been given to them, as to us, by a Cre|ator

<P>It is highly probable, that the periods of the migrations of birds will be found to be more or le&s;s uniform in pro|portion as the climates of the countries to which they migrate are more or le&s;s variable in their temperature. It is perhaps, upon this principle, that we are to explain the difference of the times of the arrival and departure of the birds of Penn&s;ylvania, and other parts of North-America. The climates of the&s;e countries are extremely variable; I &s;uppo&s;e more &s;o that mo&s;t other countries that are known to us. If, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed by many writers, the hand of man, by clearing and by cultivating the &s;urface of the earth, contributes e&s;&s;entially to the greater uniformity in the temperature of climates, it is rea&s;onable to conjecture, that the time will come, when the periods of the migrations of our birds will be more con&s;tant and fixed. For in North-America, e&s;pecially the United-States, the progre&s;s of population, and of clearing and cultivating the earth, is more rapid and immen&s;e than in any other portion of the world.</P>

<P>It would be a very curious &s;ubject of inquiry,&mdash;What changes have taken place in the periods of the arrival and di&s;appearance of the pa&s;&s;enger-birds, in tho&s;e countries in which ob&s;ervations have long been made by the ancient poets, and by naturali&s;ts? Perhaps, an inve&s;tigation of this que&s;tion would, in &s;ome degree, illu&s;trate the changes which climates are &s;aid to have undergone. Thus, the time of the Swallow's coming into Italy, is particularly mentioned both by Columella and by Pliny,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columella &s;ays, the Swallow vi&s;its Italy about the twentieth or twenty-third of February.

<P>The fourth column of the tables will enable the curious naturali&s;t to form &s;ome idea of the temperature of our climate (by &s;howing the time of lea&s;ing, flowering, planting, &amp;c. of a con&s;iderable number of vegetables, both native and foreign); at the &s;ame time, that it will point out, in a number of in&s;tances, the coincidence between this progre&s;s in vegetation and the arrival and di&s;appearance of the migratory birds.

<P>It is well known, that the ancients were of opinion, that the arrival of certain birds of pa&s;&s;age afforded one of the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t directions for the planting of different kinds of vegetables, and for other agricultural purpo&s;es. Thus Virgil, who was at once a naturali&s;t and poet, tells us, that the be&s;t time for planting vineyards (in Italy) is when the White bird, or Storck, appears:
<Q><L>Optima vinetis &s;atio, cum vere rubenti</L>
<L>Candida venit avis longis invi&s;a colubrit.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Georgic. Lib. II. 319&mdash;320.</HI></BIBL></Q>
I could point out, in the happy compo&s;itions of this great poet, other in&s;tances of a &s;imilar kind. The following is too beautiful to be omitted. The poet of Mantua is here de&s;cribing the method and the time for killing a &s;teer for the purpo&s;e of obtaining from its putrid gore a &s;tock of bees, as was practi&s;ed by the ancient Egyptians.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It appears to have been a very general opinion among the ancients, that Bees were produced from the putrid bodies of animals. A very curious pa&s;&s;age in the 14th chapter of the book of Judges &s;hows the high antiquity of this notion. After Samp&s;on had killed the young Lion, "he turned a&s;ide to &s;ee the carca&s;e of the lion: and behold there was a &s;warm of Bees and honey in the carca&s;e of the lion." The Greeks believed, that the&s;e in&s;ects aro&s;e from putrid bullocks, and hence they gave them a name expre&s;&s;ive of this &s;uppo&s;ed origin. According to Archelaus, bees proceed from bullocks, and wa&s;ps from hor&s;es. So rude were the opinions of the ancients re&s;pecting the origin of the&s;e in&s;ects. It is certain, however, that putrid carca&s;es are often vi&s;ited by bees, and it is not unlikely that from the&s;e carca&s;es, they may be able to procure honey. It was, doubtle&s;s, from ob&s;erving, that &s;warms of bees frequent the dead bodies of animals, that the ancient Egyptians had re|cour&s;e to &s;uch bodies for the purpo&s;e of repairing the total lo&s;s of their honey-making in&s;ects. The manner of doing this is beautifully related by Virgil, who traces back the practice to its fir&s;t &s;ource. <HI>See Georgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Lib. IV. beginning at line</HI> 281.</NOTE> He tells us this mu&s;t be done early in the &s;pring, before the meadows are painted with the colours of flowers, and be|fore the Swallow builds its ne&s;t upon the rafters.</P>

<P>Although in Penn&s;ylvania, and many other parts of the United-States, the arrival of our birds does not appear to be as uniform as it is in many of the countries of the old world; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Page 10.</NOTE> the arrival of &s;everal &s;pecies is, neverthele&s;s, &s;o regular, that it may be con&s;idered as the &s;ignal for commencing certain agricultural operations. Thus, the Mu&s;cicapa fu&s;ca, which we call Pewe, is one of the earlie&s;t Spring birds of pa&s;&s;age, vi&s;iting the neighbourhood of Philadel|phia about the middle of March. We have &s;eldom hard fro&s;ts after the arrival of this bird, which &s;eems to give a pretty confident a&s;&s;urance to the farmer, that he may very &s;oon begin to open the ground and plant. It is an old ob|&s;ervation in Penn&s;ylvania, that when the Whip-poor-will (Caprimulgus virginianus) arrives, it is time to go bare|footed; that is, the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on is pretty far advanced, and &s;ufficiently warm to admit of laying a&s;ide the u&s;e of &s;hoes, without much inconvenience. This adage originated in the days of greater &s;implicity than the pre&s;ent. Some of our Indians believe, that this bird is a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent to call their attention to the planting of the ground. Accordingly upon the arrival of the Whip-poor-will, they &s;ay to one another, "the <HI>Weecolis</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This is the Delaware.

<P>I am of opinion, that all the birds which are mentioned in the tables, with the exception of the Alauda magna (Meadow-Lark), Tetrao virginianus (Partridge), and a very few others, are migratory birds, or birds of pa&s;&s;age. But I do not expect that this opinion will be univer&s;ally received by naturali&s;ts.

<P>Some ingenious gentlemen, with whom I have conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, are even of opinion, that but a very few of our birds are, &s;trictly &s;peaking, birds of pa&s;&s;age. They imagine, that &s;ome of the&s;e birds, at the coming on of cold weather, pa&s;s into a torpid &s;tate, whil&s;t others merely take &s;helter from the inclemency of the wea|ther, in clo&s;e thickets, in the hollows of trees, rocks, &amp;c. without becoming torpid. This opinion may be &s;up|ported by plau&s;ible arguments. Some &s;pecies of Swallows have occa&s;ionally been found in a torpid &s;tate. In mild winters, &s;everal of tho&s;e birds which are thought to be commonly migratory, are &s;een among us; and even after the di&s;appearance of &s;ome &s;pecies, &s;uch as the Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, one or two warm days in the winter time will bring them back again. This notion is likewi&s;e favoured by the torpid &s;tate into which &s;o many of our ani|mals pa&s;s, and continue, during the winter &s;ea&s;on; &s;uch as different &s;pecies of Lizards, Tortoi&s;es, Frogs, Serpents, and In&s;ects. Nor is it merely the animals with cold blood <HI>(Sanguis frigidus)</HI> that become torpid. Some of our quadrupeds fall into a &s;imilar &s;tate. Such are the Arctomys Monax, or Maryland Marmot (be&s;t known in the United-States by the names of Ground-Hog, and Wood-chuck), and &s;ome of the &s;maller animals of the order <HI>Glires,</HI> par|ticularly &s;ome &s;pecies of Dipus, or Jerboa. Other &s;pecies, again, that do not become torpid, keep them&s;elves con|fined in clo&s;e quarters, during the greater part of the winter-&s;ea&s;on. Such are &s;ome of the &s;pecies of Squirrel, the Didelphis Opo&s;&s;um (Opo&s;&s;um), and others.</P>

<P>The&s;e various facts, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;eem to give &s;ome degree of plau&s;ibility to the notion, that our birds <HI>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mate,</HI> &Dagger; or take up their winter-quarters among us, and that they do not migrate to a di&s;tance. Still, however, I cannot but adopt the latter notion. The complete di&s;clo&s;ure of the fact, that the &s;erpents, frogs, &s;ome quadrupeds, &amp;c. become torpid, is rather an argument again&s;t the torpid &s;tate of our birds. Why &s;hould it be &s;o much more difficult to di&s;cover the <HI>latter</HI> than the former in a torpid &s;tate, if <HI>they</HI> actually went into this &s;tate? Ten thou&s;and &s;erpents may be found in the torpid &s;tate as readily as a &s;ingle Swallow, or Humming. Bird.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix P. 18.</NOTE> It is recorded in &s;ome part of Mr. Bo&s;|well's ponderous <HI>Life</HI> of the late Dr. Samuel John&s;on, that in a conver&s;ation which took place on the &s;ubject of the an|nual di&s;appearance of Woodcocks, in England, the doctor ob&s;erved, that the di&s;covery of a few of the&s;e birds, in the &s;ummer time, only proved that the &s;pecies does, in general, emigrate from the country. <HI>"Exceptia probat regulam,"</HI> &s;aid the literary Hercules.

<PB N="xiii" REF="035159_0012_10012A84186EE9D0">or other &s;tate, during the winter-&s;ea&s;on, &s;eems rather to &s;trengthen, than to weaken, the argument, that the&s;e birds are, in general, migratory birds. If all the&s;e birds continued among us, <HI>many</HI> of them would be found. The labours of one century, or more, in cutting down the timber of the fore&s;t, in blowing rocks, in draining mill|ponds, and mar&s;hes, would furni&s;h more than five or &s;ix in&s;tances (and they not always quite &s;o well authenti|cated as we could wi&s;h) of Swallows, &amp;c. being found during the winter-&s;ea&s;on, in a benumbed &s;tate.</P>

<P>The argument derived from the torpid &s;tate into which &s;o many of our animals are ob&s;erved to fall upon the ap|proach of winter, is of le&s;s weight than may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, be imagined. The&s;e animals are much le&s;s capable of migrating than the birds. If they were capable of making long journies to more favourable climates, I do not doubt they would make them. For I am per&s;uaded, by a variety of experiments and ob&s;ervations which I have made, and may, perhaps, be induced to communicate to the public at &s;ome future period, that mo&s;t of our hybernating ani|mals go with reluctance into this &s;tate. I am even of opinion, that the &s;tate of torpidity of <HI>many</HI> animals is a &s;tate of pain and &s;ufferance. This ob&s;ervation, at lea&s;t, &s;eems to hold good with re&s;pect to tho&s;e animals (and I believe they con&s;titute the greater number of the hybernating animals) which divide the winter between &s;leeping and wak|ing: which, in other words, under the influence of cold and other cau&s;es, fall into a kind of profound &s;leep, during which the functions of the heart and the lungs are con&s;tantly performed; and even that of the &s;tomach and inte&s;|tines, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, goes on: and during all which time, &s;uch animals are &s;en&s;ible to the influence of mecha|nical and other &s;timuli. This cla&s;s of hybernating quadrupeds often, during the cour&s;e of the winter, &s;pontaneou&s;ly awake from their &s;lumber, take food, and fall into &s;lumber, again. I do not, however, imagine, that animals, which are &s;o torpid as to be incapable of being rou&s;ed by the application of the mo&s;t powerful &s;timuli, can be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of pain and &s;ufferance. But I believe, that the number of the&s;e <HI>continual</HI> &s;leepers is very &s;mall, even in the colde&s;t climates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>We are certain, that the torpid &s;tate of many animals is altogether an accidental circum&s;tance: that is, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;pecies. I will not a&s;&s;ert, with my learned and ingenious friend, Mr. Fabricius, that it is not natural to, nor coeval with, the &s;pecies. It would be difficult to prove this po&s;ition: but the po&s;ition which I have advanced may be maintained. Animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies have often a very exten&s;ive range over the world. Thus, the Ur&s;us Lotor, or Raccoon, extends from Lake-Superior to the We&s;t-India-I&s;lands, and the warm parts of South-America. The Opo&s;&s;um has a range not much le&s;s exten&s;ive. I trace the Rattle-Snake (Crotalus horridus) as far north as the Bay of Saguena, on Lake-Huron, and it is known in the country of Bra&s;il. In &s;uch exten&s;ive tracts of country, the&s;e animals are expo&s;ed to very different degrees of temperature: on the one hand, to a great alternation of heat and cold; on the other hand, to a perpetual &s;pring and &s;ummer. We ought not, therefore, to expect to find any of them torpid in the whole of this exten&s;ive range. In fact, &s;everal of tho&s;e animals which become torpid in the northern parts of our country do not fall into this &s;tate in the &s;outhern and warmer climates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my account of the Dipus Americanus, or American Jerbos, in the 4th volume of the Tran&s;actions of the American Philo&s;ophical Society.</NOTE> As cold, however, is not the only cau&s;e of the torpidity of animals, we mu&s;t not be &s;urprized to find in&s;tances of animals becom|ing torpid in climates that are warm. Extreme heat, like extreme cold, &s;eems to predi&s;po&s;e the animal &s;y&s;tem to this &s;tate, particularly, perhaps, when there is a deficiency of food.</P>

<P>Nothing &s;eems more improbable than that a cla&s;s of animals, &s;uch as the greater number of birds, which are ca|pable of rapid and immen&s;e flights, &s;hould continue in a country in which the winter's cold is generally very inten&s;e, and in which, at the &s;ame time, the principal articles of their food are not to be procured. But I am far from deny|ing, that &s;ome birds do pa&s;s their winters with us, either in a torpid &s;tate, or otherwi&s;e. Some &s;pecies continue with us pretty regularly: and individuals of many &s;pecies do occa&s;ionally continue with us. I have already ob&s;erved, that "during our mild winters, &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;pecies of birds which, in general, are undoubtedly migratory, continue the winter through in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page ix. &sect; XVI.</NOTE> It mu&s;t be evident, therefore, that extreme cold is the great cau&s;e which compels the&s;e animals to retire &s;outh. But it is not the only cau&s;e. A deficiency of their proper food is another, not much le&s;s exten&s;ive. The greater number of our birds of the order of pa&s;&s;eres feed upon in&s;ects, and the &s;eeds and berries of vegetables. The&s;e, particularly the former, are not to be procured in the winter-&s;ea&s;on, in quantity &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of the immen&s;e number of birds which vi&s;it us at other &s;ea&s;ons of the year. If our climate were more moderate than it is, and if an abundance of food were at all times to be procured, the number of our Re&s;ident Birds would, doubtle&s;s, be much greater than it is. It is evident, that a failure of their food is one of the great cau&s;es of the migrations of birds. Thus no &s;ooner has the Zizania aquatica (Reed), which is one of the principal foods of the Rice-Birds, &s;hed its &s;eed, than the&s;e birds di&s;ap|pear, returning &s;outhwards.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Tables.

<P>Independent on the mildne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, and the continuance of an abundance of their favourite kinds of food, individuals (and in &s;ome in&s;tances large flocks) of many different kinds of migratory birds pa&s;s their winters with us. Dr. Darwin ob&s;erves, that "tho&s;e &s;wallows that have been hatched too late in the year to acquire their full &s;trength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident or di&s;ea&s;e, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and even under water in" a "torpid &s;tate, from which they have been revived by the warmth of a fire."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zoonomia, VOL. I Sect. XVI.</NOTE> I &s;uppo&s;e the learned doctor has not completely a&s;certained the fact, that &s;uch &s;wallows were actually hatched later than others, or that they had been maimed by accident or di&s;ea&s;e. But it is highly probable, that the circum&s;tances which he mentions are &s;ome of the cau&s;e which compel the&s;e and many other kinds of birds to pa&s;s their winters in climates, and in &s;ituations, very different from tho&s;e in which the &s;pecies at large, are, at &s;uch times, found.</P>

<P>Birds, in migrating, often lo&s;e them&s;elves, particularly, perhaps, when they get into the currents of &s;trong winds, to which they mu&s;t &s;ometimes be obedient. The large flight of Parakeets,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Page vi. &sect;. VII.</NOTE> which vi&s;ited the neighbourhood of Al|bany, in the winter of 1780, was no doubt carried thither by a &s;trong we&s;terly wind. Such wanderers, it is pro|bable, often go into a torpid &s;tate. It is &s;aid, that great numbers of Parakeets (I &s;uppo&s;e the P&s;ittacus carolinen&s;is) are &s;ometimes, in the winter-&s;ea&s;on, found torpid in the hollows of trees, in North-Carolina. Admitting the fact, is it not likely, that the&s;e birds have been wanderers, like the New-York flock ju&s;t mentioned? Accidents of this kind are more frequent than is perhaps imagined. And I do not doubt that to &s;uch accidents we mu&s;t a&s;cribe <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the in&s;tances of &s;wallows and other birds being found, in the winter-&s;ea&s;on, in a &s;tate of hybernation. It will be &s;aid, that this idea favours the notion, that birds are capable of entering into this &s;tate according to their &s;ituation. I do really &s;uppo&s;e &s;o. Perhaps all birds, all quadrupeds, in &s;hort all animals, are capable of this &s;tate. Nor are vegetables exempted from it. Tho&s;e aquatic plants which, at the approach of winter, withdraw them&s;elves to the bottom of the water, and, on the opening of the &s;pring, emerge from their watery bed, may be denominated HYBER|NATING
<PB N="xv" REF="035159_0014_10012A90A759E5F8">VEGETABLES. Perhaps this name might likewi&s;e be applied to tho&s;e vegetables, which are natives of warm, &s;outhern countries, but gradually accommodate them&s;elves to the rigorous winters of northern climates. I think, it was the late Mr. John Hunter who fir&s;t ventured to conjecture, that man him&s;elf is not incapable of be|coming torpid. Profe&s;&s;or Fabricius is of the &s;ame opinion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am &s;orry, that I have not now an opportunity of examining Mr. Fabricius's memoir.

<P>It it important for our purpo&s;e, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion of the di&s;appearance of birds, that many of tho&s;e &s;pecies which are believed to be migratory are annually &s;een on their pa&s;&s;age; in the &s;pring from the &s;outh to the north, and in the autumn from the north to the &s;outh. Some of the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers migrate in immen&s;e flocks, whil&s;t others go and return more individually. Mr. Bartram has &s;een, in the autumn, large flocks of all our four &s;pecies of Swallows, on their return &s;outhward from Penn&s;ylvania, through Carolina, Florida, &amp;c. and in the &s;pring on their return to the northward again.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. P. 16.</NOTE> The immen&s;e migrations of the Pa&s;&s;enger-Pigeons are well known to every body in this country. I have already hinted at the great flights of Fringilla tri&s;tis, Motacilla Sialis, Loxia Cur|viro&s;tra, Fringilla &mdash; (Hemp-Bird), and Anas canaden&s;is, which are annually ob&s;erved on their pa&s;&s;age to the &s;outh.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Page viii. &sect;.

This &s;pecies is found in Mexico. It is de&s;cribed by Hernandez, who calls it, <HI>Toquilcoyotl.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Pag 44. Cap. cxlviii.</NOTE> They arrive in Florida and Carolina, from the &s;outh, in the months of Hebruary and March. The flocks, which are immen&s;e, are heard and &s;een very high in the air. Their phalanx is in the form of the letter V. They pa&s;s over Penn&s;ylvania, the Jer&s;ies, New-York, &amp;c. and continue their rout as far north as Hud&s;on's Bay, where they breed, and in the autumn retire to the &s;outh again. It is curious, however, that in their return, they do not move in the &s;ame form in which they came. They now form two or three circles inter&s;ecting each other, often changing the figure of the body, and forming again, as they are joined by other &s;quadrons.

<P>I fear, I &s;hall be thought to have taken up too much time in endeavouring to prove, that the greater number of our birds which di&s;appear on the approach of winter, retire to &s;outhern and milder climates. Indeed, I am of opinion, that the migration of our birds is a fact &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the natural hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals, that it will not, in general, be doubted, except by tho&s;e per&s;ons who are propen&s;e to doubt on every &s;ubject. In A&s;ia, in Africa, and in Europe, where ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject have long been made, the migration of many &s;pecies has been com|pletely e&s;tabli&s;hed. In our own times, it has been particularly ob&s;erved that many &s;pecies vi&s;it different countries of Europe in the &s;pring, and leave them in the autumn, in the &s;ame manner as other &s;pecies vi&s;it and leave us at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;ons of the year.</P>

<P>But it is &s;aid, we are unable to determine to what particular country the&s;e American birds of pa&s;&s;age emigrate. This, which re&s;pect to many &s;pecies, is &s;trictly true. The ob&s;ervation, however, does not apply to all the migratory birds which I have mentioned.</P>

<P>It is pretty certain, that &s;ome of our migratory birds do not remove to a very great di&s;tance. Of this number are tho&s;e &s;pecies which even in the depth of winter make their appearance among us when we have a few days of warm and open weather. The Blue-Bird is one of the&s;e birds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Section III. Page 12.</NOTE> It is probable that it does not often re|move far. Perhaps, it goes to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, where the temperature is more equable. Perhaps, however, the&s;e birds might, with more propriety, be con&s;idered as Re&s;idents. They, certainly, &s;ometimes continue with us the whole winter. They may ea&s;ily find a &s;ecure retreat from the winter's cold in the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, and in clo&s;e thickets of wood. Po&s;&s;ibly, tho&s;e &s;pecies which are &s;een among us in mild winters, do not commonly re|tire as far &s;outh as the others. But this is only conjecture. We are certain that the Turdus Polyglottos, the Ardea Herodias, and &s;everal others, which <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> winter in Penn&s;ylvania, do not <HI>always</HI> winter in the &s;outhern &s;tates.</P>

<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The greater number of our migratory birds &s;eem to remove to a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from us. It is proba|ble, that they pa&s;s their winters in the Carolinas, Georgia, the Floridas, Mexico, Surinam, Bra&s;il, and all the warm parts of South-America, and the We&s;t-India-I&s;lands. That, in general, they remove farther &s;outh than the &s;outh|ern parts of the United-States may &s;afely be inferred from the very &s;mall number of our birds that is known to hiemate in this part of the country. Thus, the Swallows are no more ob&s;erved to winter in the &s;outhern &s;tates than they are in Penn&s;ylvania. And my friend Mr. Bartram a&s;&s;ures me, that he does not know more than three of the Spring Birds of Pa&s;&s;age that regularly winter in that part of the Union. The&s;e are the Mu&s;cicapa carolinen&s;is (Cat-Bird), Columba carolinen&s;is (Turtle-Dove), and the Turdus minor, or Little Thru&s;h. They winter as far north as Cape-Fear, in North-Carolina. I do not &s;uppo&s;e, however, that this is the whole li&s;t of the pa&s;&s;enger-birds of Penn&s;ylvania that continue the winter through in the &s;outhern &s;tates. Some have, probably, e&s;caped Mr. Bartram's ob&s;ervation. At any rate, it will not be doubted, that during very mild winters many &s;pecies con|tinue in the&s;e &s;tates, &s;ince, during &s;uch winters, &s;everal &s;pecies remain in Penn&s;ylvania. I am a&s;&s;ured, that the Rice-Birds often pa&s;s the whole winter in South-Carolina; and &s;ome gentlemen, with whom I have conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, are even of opinion, that the &s;pecies regularly hiemate in that &s;tate. This, however, I pre&s;ume is a mi&s;|take. Mr. Cate&s;by &s;ays the Mocking Bird hiemates in Carolina. That it does &s;o occa&s;ionally, there can be little doubt: but it is pretty certain, that, in general, it is a migratory bird.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL. II. page 16. It is a curious fact, that previous to the cold winter of 1779&mdash;1780, or 1783&mdash;1784 (I am not po&s;itive which), the Mocking-Bird more commonly remained in the vicinity of Philadelphia and other parts of Penn&s;ylvania, during the winter-&s;ea&s;on, than it has done &s;ince that time. I am inclined to think, that the extreme &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on I allude to has frightened the&s;e birds away. I am &s;en&s;ible, however, that this mode of explaining the fact will not appear &s;atisfactory to tho&s;e naturali&s;ts who believe, that the in&s;tinct of animals is a <HI>vis impellent,</HI> a "determinate" &s;omething; and that they never acquire any knowledge by experience. Very different is my opinion, as I &s;hall fully &s;how in a work on the In&s;tinct of animals, in which I have been, for &s;ome time, engaged.</NOTE> I &s;u&s;pect that, be&s;ides the three &s;pecies men|tioned by Mr. Bartram, the following birds pretty regularly hiemate in &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates, particularly South-Carolina, and Georgia, and in the country of Florida: Oriolus phoeniceus, Gracula Qui&s;cula, Picus auratus, Picus erythrocephalus, Fringilla pecoris, Alauda alpe&s;tris, Charadrius vociferus, Rallus virginianus, Scolopax Gal|linago, and a good many of the <HI>An&s;eres.</HI></P>

<P>My learned and candid friend Mr. Pennant (who&s;e name I never mention but with plea&s;ure and with gratitude; who&s;e works have contributed much to my information, and who&s;e example has &s;timulated me to the &s;tudy of na|tural hi&s;tory) thinks there is the "greate&s;t probability," that numbers of the birds of Kamt&s;chatka are common to North-America, "and that they pa&s;s there the &s;ea&s;ons of migration."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology.

I think (for I write from memory) that it is Profe&s;&s;or Bi&s;eke who has lately &s;hown, that &s;everal of the North-American birds annually vi&s;it the neighbourhood of Mittau, in Courland.

I certainly do not carry my birds as far, in &s;earch of food, of re&s;ting places, and of better climes, as did Cotton Mather, of New-England, who fancied that the Wild-Pigeons, on leaving us, repaired "to &s;ome undi&s;covered Satellite, accompanying the Earth at a near Di&s;tance."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">See the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, Abridg'd, &amp;c.

<HEAD>SECTION III. OF THE RESIDENT BIRDS OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>RESIDENT BIRDS,</HI> I mean tho&s;e birds which, in general, continue in Penn&s;ylvania the whole year; which build their ne&s;ts, rear their young, and are commonly thought to continue, near the di&s;trict in which they them&s;elves were reared. I &s;hall enumerate the&s;e birds in the order of the Linnaean arrangement.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="list of birds">
<HEAD>ACCIPITRES. RAPACIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>Falco Leucocephalus. White-Headed Eagle. (Bald-Eagle.) This, in the opinion of &s;ome per&s;ons, is the &s;ame bird as the next &s;pecies. But I cannot adopt this notion.</P>
<P>Falco regalis of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Great Grey Eagle. This is our large&s;t Eagle.</P>
<P>Falco aquilinus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Great Red-Tailed Hawk. This is the large&s;t &s;pecies of Hawk hitherto di&s;|covered in Penn&s;ylvania. The tail is of a red brick colour.</P>
<P>Falco columbarius. Pigeon-Hawk.</P>
<P>Falce glaucus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Blui&s;h Hawk. A beautiful &s;pecies. Colour a pale &s;ky-blue. Tips of the wings black. Feeds upon its prey, as it flies along with it.</P>
<P>Strix virginiana. Great Horned Owl.</P>
<P>Strix A&s;lo. Red Owl, Little Owl. (Screech-Owl.)</P>
<P>Strix varius of Bartram. MS. Hen Owl. This is a large &s;pecies without ears. It is next in &s;ize to the Strix virginiana, or Great Horned Owl. Of a clay or dirt colour, &s;potted with darker brown.</P>
<P>Lanius Excubitor. Great Shrike. (Gu&s;t Bird? Nine-Killer.) For &s;ome intere&s;ting information concerning this bird, &s;ee <HI>Tran&s;actions of the American Philo&s;ophical Society.</HI> VOL. IV.</P>
<P>Lanius Collurio? Red-Backed Shrike. This &s;pecies comes to us from the northward, in October or November. In very mild winters, &s;tays in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Is always with us in the &s;pring, on its return to the north. Does not breed with us: does not &s;ing in the autumn, but does in the &s;pring.</P>

<P>Corvus Corone. Carrion Crow. (Crow.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is another &s;pecies of Corvus which differs from both the &s;pecies here mentioned.

<P>Corvus cri&s;tatus. Blue-Crow. (Blue-Jay, Jay-Bird.)</P>
<P>Picus pileatus. Pileated Woodpecker. (Wood-Cock).</P>
<P>* Picus erythrocephalus. Red-Headed-Woodpecker. Continues about Philadelphia, in mild winters. In very cold winters, it goes farther &s;outhward.</P>
<P>* Picus auratus. Golden-Wing-Woodpecker. Some few of the&s;e birds are &s;een among us, in the warmer or milder winters. In general, they migrate farther &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Picus villo&s;us. Hairy Woodpecker. <HI>Se-&s;e-ah</HI> of the Wyandot-Indians.</P>
<P>Picus pube&s;cens. Downy Woodpecker. <HI>Sho-ah</HI> of the Wyandot-Indians.</P>
<P>Sitta. Black-Headed Nuthatch. (Sap-Sucker.)</P>
<P>Certhia fu&s;ca of Bartram. MS. Brown-Creeper. I believe this &s;pecies is not de&s;cribed. The general colour is a nut|brown: &s;peckled with black or deep du&s;ky: &s;ome white &s;pots on the fir&s;t coverts. Edwards (<HI>Nat. Hi&s;t.</HI> vol. I. 26.) has a bird a good deal like this.

But I do not, in the lea&s;t, doubt that the dome&s;ticated kind was fir&s;t brought from America into Europe. Indeed, I believe with Mr. Pennant, that America is exclu|&s;ively its native country.

<HEAD>NOTE.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;trict language, there are very few of our birds entitled to the name of RESIDENTS. Penn&s;ylvania, like every other portion of the United-States, is &s;ubject to great extremes of heat and cold; and the&s;e extremes are known to have a decided in&s;luence upon the di&s;po&s;itions of animals. During our colde&s;t winters, therefore, many of tho&s;e birds, which I have con&s;idered as re&s;idents, migrate to the &s;outh. This was the ca&s;e in the ever-memorable winter of 1779 and 1780, when very few of the u&s;ually re&s;ident birds continued with us: and many of tho&s;e, which did continue, peri&s;hed with the &s;everity of the cold.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="035159_0030_10012AD66673AC78">
<HEAD>OCCASIONAL, OR ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS.</HEAD>
<P>There is a propriety in the divi&s;ion of the Re&s;ident Birds, into &s;uch as commonly continue in the country the whole year through, and &s;uch as only occa&s;ionally continue. The latter may be called OCCASIONAL, or ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS. They &s;eldom continue with us except in open, mild winters. The&s;e, in the preceding li&s;t, are marked with an a&s;teri&s;k.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I have had the le&s;s he&s;itation in blending them together, becau&s;e it is highly probable, that in a tract of country &s;o exten&s;ive and various as the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ome of the birds, which about Philadelphia are only occa&s;ionally re&s;ident, may be more generally &s;o in other parts of the country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of birds">
<HEAD>OCCASIONAL VISITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>Some of the birds which are ob&s;erved in Penn&s;ylvania may, with propriety, be thrown into a &s;ection called OCCA|SIONAL VISITANTS. Of the&s;e I have already made mention in the Introduction to the&s;e Fragments. The&s;e Occa&s;ional Vi&s;itants are &s;uch birds as occa&s;ionally come to Penn&s;ylvania, either from the more northern or from the more &s;outhern parts of North-America. With <HI>all</HI> the cau&s;es which induce them to vi&s;it us, I am not &s;uffici|ently acquainted to &s;peak on the &s;ubject, with confidence. The following, however, are certainly &s;ome of the&s;e cau&s;es, viz. &s;everity of cold, &s;carcity of food, and inten&s;ity of heat.</P>
<P N="1">I. The birds which are driven by the &s;everity of cold all come to us from the northward. The&s;e occa&s;ional vi&s;it|ants are pretty numerous, during our very &s;evere winters, when &s;ome of the birds of Canada and Labrador are &s;een among us. The two following &s;pecies of Strix de&s;erve to be mentioned under this head, viz. the Great White Owl (Strix Nyctea?). This &s;pecies is never &s;een in the vicinity of Philadelphia, except in tho&s;e winters which are very &s;evere, long, and clo&s;e. This and the following &s;pecies (See the Tables) were &s;een about Phila|delphia, at the clo&s;e of the winter of 1791-92, which was one of our &s;evere&s;t winters. The Tawney-Faced Owl (Strix &s;tridula?) is a very beautiful &s;pecies. It makes its appearance, in the day-time, near hou&s;es and barns, watching for mice, or for tho&s;e weakly birds which have been compelled by the &s;everity of the cold to take &s;helter there.</P>
<P N="2">II. It may readily be imagined, that a &s;carcity of food, particularly of their favourite food, is one of the cau&s;es which induce birds to make occa&s;ional vi&s;its to other countries than their own. I am even of opinion, that this has been the original cau&s;e of &s;ome of tho&s;e migrations which are now regular and exten&s;ive.</P>
<P N="3">III. I have mentioned inten&s;ity of heat, or very warm weather, as one of the cau&s;es which &s;ometimes impel or induce birds to migrate to us. It is probable, however, that this cau&s;e more frequently operates in a &s;econdary manner; that is, by producing a &s;carcity of food. All the Occa&s;ional Vi&s;itants that fall under this &s;ection come from the &s;outhward. See the Introduction, where I have mentioned &s;ome of the&s;e vi&s;itants.</P>

<P N="11">11. Fringilla&mdash;. (Hemp-Bird.) This is one of our migratory birds. It is not the Fringilla cannabina of Linnaeus; but, like it, feeds on the ripe hemp-feed. Is often &s;een about Philadelphia. On the authority of Mr. William Bartram, who thinks it an unde&s;cribed &s;pecies.</P>

Perhaps, it pa&s;&s;es from the north to the &s;outh, and returns to the north, through the country we&s;t of the great ranges of our mountains, which is certainly the rout pur&s;ued by &s;ome of the migra|to birds that are &s;eldom, or never, &s;een in the Atlantic parts of the United-States.

<P>* ORIOLUS phoeniceus. I cannot altogether admit of the propriety of placing this bird among the <HI>Picae,</HI> as Linnaeus and other naturali&s;ts have done. The female appears to be an Emberiza, or Fringilla. This bird is the Sturnus predatorius of Mr. William Bartram. See his <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Mu&s;cicapa fu&s;ca. This is the Mu&s;cicapa nunciola of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Alauda rubra. The Alauda migratoria of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Alauda fu&s;ca of the &s;ame gentleman. The &s;pe|cific name rubra is an improper one: for the bird has no red feathers.</P>
<P>* Alauda alp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iris. This is the Alauda campe&s;tris of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Fringilla dome&s;tica (mihi). Motacilla dome&s;tica, or Regulus rufus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> In very mild winters, this &s;ocial dome&s;tic little bird continues with us. It is the earlie&s;t of our &s;pring &s;inging, birds. Its note is tre|mulous and agreeable. Cate&s;by has &s;igured it, VOL. I. P. 35.</P>
<P>* Fringilla ferruginea. I &s;u&s;pect this is the Hedge-Sparrow of Law&s;on, P. 144. It is the Fringilla rufa of Bar|tram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Edwards calls it Little Sparrow. Pl. 354. In New-York it is called the Shepherd.</P>
<P>* Fringilla albicollis. Fringilla fu&s;ca of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Fringilla melodia. In mild winters, this bird continues in Penn&s;ylvania, a&s;&s;ociating with the Snow-Birds. Does not appear to be de&s;eribed.</P>
<P>* Pa&s;&s;er palu&s;tris of Bartram. This appears to be a &s;pecies of Fringilla. I do not find that it is de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Fringilla exilis. This a good deal re&s;embles the Motacilla Regulus, or Golden-cre&s;ted Warbler. Perh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps, they are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>* Fringilla tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is. In different parts of the United-States, this bird is known by a variety of names, &s;uch as Gold-Finch, Yellow-Bird, Lettuce-Bird, Sallad-Bird, Flax-Seed-Bird.</P>
<P>Sitta canaden&s;is. I have been mi&s;taken in calling this the Sitta canaden&s;is. It is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies: perhaps Le Tor|chepot de Canada of Bri&s;&s;on. Tom. 3. P. 592, 593, 594. Pl. 29. Fig. 4. Sitta peregrina of Bartram. MS. Sitta varia, ventre rubro of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> I think Mr. Pennant, to whom I &s;ent a drawing and de&s;cription of it, con&s;idered it as a new &s;pecies.</P>
<P>* Picus auratus. I am informed, that this bird is known, in Maryland, by the name of Di&s;h-Wa&s;her. Linnaeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ays this &s;pecies does not climb trees; but this is a mi&s;take: and it builds its ne&s;t, like the other &s;pecies, in the holes of trees.</P>
<P>* Gracula Qui&s;cula? Several re&s;pectable authors, and among others Mr. Pennant,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. Vol. 1. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">08, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">09.</NOTE> have confounded the bird thus noted in the Tables with the Gracula Qui&s;cula of Linnaeus. But they are certainly di&s;tinct &s;pecies. I do not
<PB N="16" REF="035159_0033_10012AE0291209C0">know that the Gracula Qui&s;cula has ever been &s;een immediately about Philadelphia. It is commonly &s;een on or near the fea-coa&s;t, and not often twenty miles di&s;tant from it. It loves the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, and of bracki&s;h water. The Gracula which I mention, in the Tables, is very common about Philadelphia, where it a&s;&s;ociates with the Red-Wing Oriole, or Oriolus phoeniceus, and with Crows (Corvus Corone), committing great depredations on the mays in the fields; and in the Southern States, on the rice that is &s;tacked in the barn yards. Builds on trees, pretty high up, and &s;eems, for this purpo&s;e, to give a preference to the evergreens, &s;uch as tall Pine-trees, &amp;c. Our Gracula is either the Gracula Barrita, Boat-Tail-Grakle, or very nearly allied to it.</P>
<P>* Fringilla pecoris. This bird certainly belongs to the &s;ame genus as the Oriolus phoeniceus, whether that be Emberiza or Fringilla. It follows cows and hor&s;es, pulling a&s;under their excrements, in order to get at the feeds. It alights on their backs, eating flies and other in&s;ects from them. In &s;ome parts of Penn&s;ylvania, it is be&s;t known by the name of Cow-Bird. It is the Sturnus &s;tercorarius of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla Sialis. This is one of our earlie&s;t &s;inging birds. Its note is highly agreeable. It is the <HI>T&s;chi-boa-pe-ke-lis</HI> of the Delawares. See P. 12. Sect. III.</P>
<P>* Scolopax Gallinago. Scolopax americana rufa of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is the <HI>Me-me-u</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>

<P>* Hirundo purpurea. <HI>Pons-pau-cloo-moo&s;c,</HI> or "the bird that never re&s;ts," of the Mohegan-Indians. I am of opi|nion, that this and the three other &s;pecies of Swallow, which I have mentioned, are migratory birds. I am not ignorant, that an oppo&s;ite opinion is gaining ground among us. See Dr. Belknap's <HI>Hi&s;tory of New Hamp&s;hire,</HI> Vol. III. p. 174. My friend, Mr. William Bartram, a&s;&s;ures me, "that he has &s;een, in the &s;pring, large flocks of all our Swallows, upon their pa&s;&s;age from the &s;outh, and in the autumn, on their return &s;outhward from Penn|&s;ylvania, through Carolina, to Florida, where, however, neither of them winter; but continue farther on &s;outh|ward" <HI>MS. penes me.</HI> I cannot but con&s;ider the te&s;timony of this gentleman, in matters of this kind, as of high value. Indeed, all my enquiries convince me, that our &s;wallows are migratory birds. I am, however, far from denying, that &s;wallows have <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> been found in the hollows of decayed trees, in different parts of our country, during that very &s;ea&s;on, when it &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e birds are in a more &s;outhern climate. I will not even deny, that they have been found under the mud of rivers, &amp;c. The&s;e, however, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as <HI>extraordinary</HI> in&s;tances, which very rarely occur. They only &s;erve to &s;how the accommodating powers of birds, which &s;ome|times continue in a country the whole year through, and in other times migrate from the&s;e countries. It is not difficult to account for &s;ome of the in&s;tances of Swallows being found in trees, &amp;c. In the&s;e in&s;tances, I pre&s;ume, the birds have been compelled to take up their habitations here, after their return from the &s;outh, having been &s;urprized by very cold weather. The Swallows are, certainly, very impatient of cold.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My very re&s;pectable and learned friend Dr. John Walker, Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, u&s;ed to inform his cla&s;s, that he "Once knew a cold night (in Scotland) to overtake the Martin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (Hirundo urbica), the Swifts (Hirundo Apu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">), and the Swallows (Hirundo ru&s;tica), which benumbed them to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;eemed dead, but when they were brought into a warm room, they recovered, and after the &s;un ro&s;e, they all took to the wing. Not one of them was de&s;troyed by the cold."</NOTE> No wonder, therefore, that in a climate &s;o variable as that of Penn&s;ylvania, the&s;e birds &s;hould &s;ometimes retire into trees, &amp;c. to &s;eek &s;helter. I have ob&s;erved, that &s;everal weeks after the fir&s;t appearance of the Swallows in the &s;pring, the coming on of a cold day, has occa&s;ioned in them great di&s;tre&s;s. The following fact will &s;trikingly illu&s;trate what I am &s;aying. The beginning of the month of April, 1773, was unu&s;ually warm. In the vicinity of Philadelphia, the clover, in &s;ome of the fields, was five or &s;ix inches high. The Martins (Hirundo purpurea) were &s;een about the city: at this time, there came on &s;uddenly a very &s;evere &s;pell of cold weather. It de&s;troyed many of the&s;e birds, &s;everal of which were &s;een to drop down, benumbed or dead, among the clover.</P>
<P>If any &s;pecies of our &s;wallows continues with us the whole year, I think it mo&s;t likely to be the Hirundo&mdash;, or Little Bank-Martin. I have been informed, that in &s;everal in&s;tances, this &s;pecies has been found in a torpid
<PB N="17" REF="035159_0034_10012AE402EF3C68">&s;tate, in the holes of banks. I am al&s;o told, that above thirty years ago, a number of the&s;e birds were found in a Gum-tree (Ny&s;&s;a &s;ylvatica<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of Mar&s;hall: Ny&s;&s;a integri&s;olia of Aiton.</NOTE>), about four miles from the town of Lanca&s;ter. This was in the depth of winter. They were all torpid, but &s;ome of them, upon the application of heat, recovered.</P>
<P>Of the four &s;pecies of Penn&s;ylvania &s;wallows, (viz. Hirundo purpurea, the Hirundo ru&s;tica? the Hirundo&mdash;, and the Hirundo pela&s;gia) the fir&s;t, or Purple Martin, is the one which commonly vi&s;its us the earlie&s;t, viz. at the end of March, or beginning of April. The Hou&s;e-Swallow and the Little Bank-Martin come next, and the Chimney-Bird la&s;t of all. This, at lea&s;t, is the general order of the appearance of the four &s;pecies.</P>
<P>* Hirundo ru&s;tica? This is not the Hirundo ru&s;tica of Europe. It wants a name. It may be called Hirundo hor|reorum, from its &s;o generally frequenting our barns to build its ne&s;t. But this name is liable to objections. I do not know any of our <HI>Indian</HI> names for this &s;pecies. One of <HI>the&s;e</HI> (if not too long) would be the be&s;t &s;pecific name we could give to it.</P>
<P>* Hirundo&mdash;. Little Bank-Martin. This is not the Hirundo riparia of Linnaeus. It has, however, very much the manners or habits of that bird. I have never &s;een the Hirundo riparia in any part of America. Kalm, Pennant, Gmelin, and other writers a&s;&s;ert that it is a native of this continent. Dr. Belknap (P. 173) mentions the Hirundo riparia in his li&s;t of the birds of New-Hamp&s;hire: but I do not doubt that he means our Little Bank-Martin. I know (without any particular allu&s;ion to my excellent decea&s;ed friend) how the nomenclature of natural hi&s;tory has been conducted in America.</P>
<P>* Falco pi&s;catorius. This is Cate&s;by's and Bartram's name. It is the <HI>Ni-me-nees</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Certhia Pinus.</P>
<P>* Fringilla graminea. This is the Pa&s;&s;er campe&s;tris of Bartram. MS.</P>
<P>* Motacilla caerulea. Perhaps, this bird is more properly a &s;pecies of the genus Parus. It forms a very curious ne&s;t of the mo&s;s which grows upon rocks, trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>* Ardea Herodias. See Section III. p. 12.</P>
<P>* Alcedo Alcyon. <HI>Tis-ke-man-nis?</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Colymbus &s;eptentrionalis. Flocks of the&s;e birds frequent our large rivers, diving for fi&s;h. Their voice is mu&s;ical, e&s;pecially when a &s;outherly wind blows &s;trong. This is the Colymbus mu&s;icus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is as large as a goo&s;e.</P>
<P>* Colymbus migratorius of Bartram. This is near the &s;ize of a goo&s;e. Colour black. Bill red. Their principal food is eels and other fi&s;h. They vi&s;it the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, when the fro&s;ts are pa&s;&s;ed. They ge|nerally fly in companies of two, three, or four together, and but a little above the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P>* Colymbus Podiceps. This is &s;ometimes called the Water-Witch.</P>
<P>* Anas &s;pon&s;a. This beautiful &s;pecies is the <HI>Gi-gi-t&s;chi-mu-is</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. It builds its ne&s;t in the holes of trees. Attempts have been made to dome&s;ticate it. but hitherto, they have not, I believe, been &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>* Columba carolinen&s;is. See Section III. P. 12. It is the <HI>Me-med-ba-cke-mo</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Columba migratoria. The&s;e birds commonly pa&s;s the winter-&s;ea&s;on in the fore&s;ts of Carolina, Georgia, and the two Floridas; and pa&s;s over the Gulph of Mexico to the Bahama-I&s;lands. Upon their return &s;outhward in the autumn, they &s;ometimes &s;tay with us a con&s;iderable time, and they have been known, during our mild winters, to continue with us, as I have already ob&s;erved. See Section III. P. 12. and Introduction. P. ix. &sect; XVI.</P>

* Turdus rufus. Builds its ne&s;t of loo&s;e &s;ticks, u&s;ing no cement. In this re&s;pect, it agrees with the Turdus Poly|glottos, or Mocking-Bird, but differs from the Turdus migratorius, or Robin. This la&s;t u&s;es a kind of mud or mortar, in making its ne&s;t.</P>
<P>* Ardea Nycticorax. The Ardea clamator of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla Troglodytes?

The materials which it makes u&s;e of are dry gra&s;s, among the living gra&s;s of meadows. The Motacilla Troglodytes? of which I am &s;peaking, is a &s;pecies of Certhia, or Creeper. It certainly belongs to the &s;ame genus as the Certhia familiaris mentioned below, and the Certhia floridana, afterwards taken notice of.</P>
<P>* Ardea vire&s;cens. Commonly called S&mdash;e-Poke.</P>
<P>* Certhia familiaris (mihi). I now &s;u&s;pect, that this is no other than the Certhia familiaris of Linnaeus, the Euro|pean Creeper of Pennant; Le Grimpereau of Buffon. Mr. Pennant mentions this as an inhabitant of North-America, and tells us, that it is found in Sweden, "and never quits the country."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL. I.

But many facts like this will be di&s;covered in the progre&s;s of natural &s;cience.</P>
<P>* Hirundo pela&s;gia. This is the Hirundo cerdo of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Caprimulgus virginianus. This is the <HI>We-coo-lis</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. Although it feeds entirely upon in&s;ects, its fle&s;h is &s;aid to be delicious. I have been informed, that &s;ome of the&s;e birds have been found in a torpid &s;tate, in hollow trees, in Jer&s;ey. But I cannot entirely depend upon the fact; and I have little he&s;itation in &s;aying, that this bird, as well as the Swallows, to which it is allied, is a bird of pa&s;&s;age. For &s;ome notices concerning the &s;uper&s;titious opinions of our Indians re&s;pecting this bird, &s;ee my letter to Dr. Prie&s;tley, in the <HI>Tran&s;actions of the American Philo&s;ophical Society.</HI> VOL.

<P>* Oriolus Baltimore. As far as I know, this is the only Penn&s;ylvania bird that builds a pen&s;ile or hanging ne&s;t. Mr. Pennant is mi&s;taken in &s;aying that the Oriolus phoeniceus, or Red-Wing Oriole, which I have already men|tioned, builds &s;uch a ne&s;t.

<P>* Turdus Trichas. This bird is mo&s;t improperly arranged by Linnaeus under his genus of Turdus.</P>
<P>* Picus erythrocephalus. This is the <HI>Me-ma-koch-cus</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. See Section III. P. 11.</P>
<P>* Motacilla aurocapilla. This is very properly con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of Turdus, or Thru&s;h, both by Edwards and by Pennant. It is the Turdus minimus, vertice aurio, of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Tanagra rubra. This and the Summer-Red-Bird of Cate&s;by (VOL. I. P. 56.) both belong to the &s;ame genus. Their note and their manners are the &s;ame. They both eat the &s;ame food, viz. fruit and in&s;ects.</P>
<P>* Mu&s;cicapa olivacea. I do not think, with Mr. Pennant,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. V. II. P. 79.</NOTE> that this is the &s;ame bird as the Whip-Tom-Kelly of the We&s;t-Indies. Our bird has no &s;uch note; but a great variety of &s;oft, tender, and agreeable notes. It inhabits fore&s;ts, and does not, like the We&s;t-India bird, build a "pendulous ne&s;t."</P>
<P>* Mu&s;cicapa Ruticilla. Ruticilla americana of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Turdus minor. Turdus melodes of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This is, perhaps, the mo&s;t mu&s;ical of all the birds of the United-States, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;ertions of Cate&s;by and other writers to the contrary.</P>
<P>* Mu&s;cicapa viridis. This is a bird of very &s;ingular form, manners, and language. I am not &s;atisfied as to its ge|nus. It &s;eems to be allied to the Manakin of Edwards and Bri&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>* Falco &s;parverius. In the month of March, it builds its ne&s;t in hollow trees, and feeds its young with mice, frogs, and &s;mall birds.</P>
<P>* Tanagra cyanea. This is &s;ometimes called in Penn&s;ylvania, Indigo-Bird. It is the Linaria cyanea of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>

<P>* Motacilla petechia. Mr. Pennant is mi&s;taken in &s;aying that this pretty &s;pecies does not breed in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>* Mu&s;cicapa rapax of Bartram. I take this to be the Le&s;&s;er Cre&s;ted Fly-Catcher of Mr. Pennant: the Mu&s;cicapa acadica of Gmelin. It is a very u&s;eful little bird, de&s;troying numbers of the common hou&s;e-fly and other trou|ble&s;ome in&s;ects. It continues with us until late in September, when it retires &s;outherly to pa&s;s the winter.</P>
<P>* Ardea cinerea.</P>
<P>* Rallus virginianus. This is the bird which is &s;o well known in Penn&s;ylvania by the name of Rail. It is a que&s;|tion much di&s;puted among our &s;port&s;men, whether this be a bird of pa&s;&s;age, or whether it continues among us. I have no doubt, that it is a bird of pa&s;&s;age. It is well known in Carolina and Florida, where it commonly con|tinues late, devouring the &s;eed of the Zizania, Rice, and other aquatic plants. Whether it hiemates in the&s;e countries, or goes &s;till farther to the &s;outh, I do not know.</P>
<P>* Ardea parva of Bartram. I cannot find that this &s;pecies is de&s;cribed. It builds its ne&s;t in the gra&s;s of meadows. It is the &s;malle&s;t &s;pecies of the genus that is known to me.</P>
<P>* Alauda Calandra. This is the Calandra praten&s;is of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> The Calandra floralia of the &s;ame gentleman.</P>

<P>Certhia floridana (mihi). This bird I do not find figured or de&s;cribed. It is mentioned by Mr. Bartram <HI>(Travels),</HI> under the name of Motacilla coroliniana, or Regulus magnus. It is nearly twice the &s;ize of the Hou&s;e-Wren, or Certhia familiaris? Like it, its voice is loud and mu&s;ical. The upper &s;ide of the Certhia floridana is of a nut|brown colour, delicately marked with tran&s;ver&s;e waved lines, of a darker colour. The throat, brea&s;t, and belly are of a yellowi&s;h clay colour. A line of the &s;ame colour pa&s;&s;es, in form of an arch, over each eye. The bill is long, and a little bent downwards. This is a common bird in Carolina and Florida. It only occa&s;ionally vi&s;its Penn&s;ylvania, viz. in long and warm &s;ummers. Is much more common in the Jer&s;eys.</P>
<P>Vultur Aura. This bird rears its young in the &s;outhern &s;tates, before its arrival among us. I cannot learn, that it ever breeds in Penn&s;ylvania. I have been informed, that the&s;e birds have occa&s;ionally been found, in the winter|&s;ea&s;on, in the hollows of trees, and in the crevices of rocks, in different parts of the United-States, even to the north of Philadelphia. It is the <HI>Wi-nan-go-u</HI> and <HI>A-ma-t&s;chi-pu-is</HI> of the Delawares, <HI>Sot-&s;eh-tah</HI> of the Wyandots, and <HI>Gu&s;-&s;oo</HI> of the Mohegans.</P>
<P>* Ardea alba. Ardea immaculata of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>Ardea aequinoctialis. Ardea alba minor of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is Pennant's Red-Billed Egret.</P>
<P>Emberiza oryzivora. If I do not mi&s;take, this bird in Connecticut is called the Strawberry-bird. On the autho|rity of Mr. Cate&s;by, it has been believed by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable naturali&s;ts (Pennant and others), that the male and female Rice-Birds migrate &s;eparately, at different &s;ea&s;ons. Thus, it is imagined, that the males make their appearance in the vicinity of Philadelphia in the &s;pring, and the females in the autumn, or the clo&s;e of &s;ummer. Some facts which have come under my notice induce me to &s;u&s;pect, that this is a vulgar error: one of the many mi&s;takes with which natural hi&s;tory is crouded and deformed. But, at pre&s;ent, I can only throw out the &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>* Parus bicolor. This is the Parus cri&s;tatus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This &s;pecies feeds both upon in&s;ects and upon &s;eeds, picking the kernel out of the hu&s;k. In Penn&s;ylvania, it is called Tom-tit.</P>
<P>* Parus virginianus. Parus cedrus of Bartram. This bird feeds upon feeds and berries, particularly upon the re|&s;inous berries of the Juniperus virginiana, or Red-Cedar. Commonly comes to us, from the northward, about the time the&s;e berries are ripe,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Tables. P. 7.</NOTE> and &s;eems peculiarly fond of harbouring it&s;elf among the&s;e trees. Generally continues with us as long as the berries and in&s;ects (upon which al&s;o it feeds) la&s;t, and then goes northerly. Sometimes, however, it continues with us all winter.</P>
<P>* Ampelis Garrulus. In &s;ome parts of New-England, this &s;pecies is called Cherry-Bird. Like the Parus virginia|nus, it is very fond of the ripe berries of the Red-cedar. It is al&s;o very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of the ripe fruit of the Dio&s;pyros virginiana, or Per&s;immon. Builds its ne&s;t in trees of a moderate &s;ize, about the end of May, or the beginning of June.</P>
<P>Fringilla cannabina? I am not quite certain whether this be the Fringilla cannabina of Linnaeus. It is certainly very nearly allied to this &s;pecies. Large flocks of the&s;e birds vi&s;it us towards the end of the fall, or the begin|ning of the winter. They often fly at very great heights in the air: &s;o high that they cannot readily be &s;een, though their noi&s;e is di&s;tinctly heard. Either this &s;pecies or one very nearly allied to it is found as far &s;outh as the country of the Cheerake-Indians, who call it <HI>O-na-clo-nei-ta.</HI> If this be the Fringilla cannabina, it has an ex|ten&s;ive range in North-America, for it is found in the northern parts of this continent. It is one of the &s;pecies which is common to the old and new world. It is not improbable, that it performs regular migrations from the one continent to the other.</P>
<P>* Scolopax Gallinago. I have already mentioned this &s;pecies,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. P 16.</NOTE> and have taken notice of the regularity of its arrival among us.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Introduction. P. xi.</NOTE> It is, certainly, a bird of pa&s;&s;age. This &s;eems to be the &s;ame &s;pecies which is &s;o common in En|gland,
<PB N="21" REF="035159_0038_100129EF694FD610">and in other parts of Europe, and concerning who&s;e di&s;appearance the learned have &s;o much di&s;puted. There are pretty good rea&s;ons for believing, that the&s;e birds perform regular migrations between Europe and America. It is remarkable, that they are more numerous on the we&s;tern than on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Britain. They are &s;till more numerous in the we&s;t of Ireland than in the we&s;t of Scotland. "For one Wood-Cock on the ea&s;t-coa&s;t of Scotland there are twelve in the we&s;t, and for one in the we&s;t of Scotland there are twelve in Ireland."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reverend Dr Walker, of Edinburgh.</NOTE> Lord Kenmor, about the la&s;t of September, &s;ailed from Li&s;bon to Falmouth, in England, and for ten or twelve days was becalmed on the coa&s;t of France. Every day, he &s;aw from ten to twenty Wood-cocks pa&s;|&s;ing from the we&s;t towards the land. The&s;e it was imagined, came from the continent of America. But I do not &s;uppo&s;e that all our Wood-cocks thus migrate to Europe. It is pretty certain, that the&s;e birds when they vi&s;it us in the &s;pring come from the &s;outh, and in the autumn they return to the &s;outh again. How far &s;outh they proceed, I am unable to determine. They are known in Florida, where it is not improbable, that many of them pa&s;s the winter-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Fringilla pinus (mihi). This is one of our &s;pring birds of pa&s;&s;age, and I think is not de&s;cribed. It commonly continues with us until the middle or the end of April, at which time the Apple and the Pear trees are in bloom. The&s;e blo&s;|&s;oms, during &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons, are remarkably infe&s;ted by a &s;pecies of Chermes, which proves very de&s;truc|tive to the fruit. By feeding on the&s;e devouring in&s;ects, the Fringilla pinus is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of our birds. This bird, the Fringilla tri&s;tis, my Fringilla exilis, and the Fringilla cannabina? together with the Fringilla Car|duelis of the old world, all belong to the &s;ame natural genus, or family. They &s;eem, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to con|&s;titute a genus di&s;tinct from the Fringilla.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e FRAGMENTS profe&s;s to contain &s;ome <HI>u&s;eful</HI> ob&s;ervations,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the motto, in the Title-Page.</NOTE> I think this a proper place to ob&s;erve, that many of the birds of Penn&s;ylvania, and other parts of the United-States, are &s;o extremely u&s;eful to man, by de&s;troying in&s;ects and reptiles of various kinds, that they ought &s;tudiou&s;ly to be pre&s;erved, if not by the LAWS, at lea&s;t by the GOOD-SENSE, of the country. It would require many ob&s;ervations to give a complete li&s;t and hi&s;tory of the&s;e USEFUL BIRDS. I am not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ufficient quantity of facts for this purpo&s;e: but &s;ome ob&s;ervations I can offer, as materials for future inquirers.</P>
<P>It may, in the fir&s;t place, be ob&s;erved, that in&s;ects appear to be the fir&s;t food of almo&s;t all the birds of our country. The more I have inquired, the more I have been convinced, that almo&s;t all birds live, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon in&s;ects. Even tho&s;e &s;pecies which con&s;ume con&s;iderable quantities of feeds, berries, and fruit, al&s;o con&s;ume large quantities of in&s;ects: and there are rea&s;ons to believe, that others who&s;e principal food is the nectar of plants al&s;o live partly upon the&s;e in&s;ects. Thus Mr. Brandis<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the article Trochilus in Ginelin's edition of the Sy&s;tema Natr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae. TOM. I. P. 485.</NOTE> found the ve&s;tiges of in&s;ects in the &s;tomach of the Trochilus, or Hum|ming-Bird, one of the la&s;t birds one would have &s;u&s;pected of feeding on animal food.</P>
<P>The greater number of our &s;maller birds of the order of <HI>Pa&s;&s;eres,</HI> &s;eem to demand our attention and protection. Some of them feed pretty entirely upon in&s;ects, and others upon a mixed food, that is, in&s;ects and the vegetable feeds, &amp;c. Many of them contribute much to our plea&s;ure by the melody of their notes. I believe the injury they do us is but &s;mall compared to the good they render us. I &s;hall mention, under &s;ix different heads, a few of the u&s;e|ful birds of this and &s;ome other orders.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mu&s;cicapa acadica of Gmelin? This is the Le&s;&s;er Cre&s;ted Flycatcher of Pennant. It is called in Penn&s;ylvania the Le&s;&s;er or Wood-Pewe. This little bird builds in woods and in fore&s;ts. After the young have left the ne&s;ts, the parents conduct them to the gardens and habitations of men. Here the whole brood dwells in trees near the hou&s;es, where they are fed with the common hou&s;e-fly, and other in&s;ects, that are caught by the old birds. The young ones are &s;oon capable of obtaining their food in the &s;ame way. This &s;pecies of Mu&s;cicapa vi&s;its us in the &s;pring, and commonly continues with us until late in September, when it retires &s;outherly to winter.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, feeds principally, if not entirely, upon in&s;ects, both &s;uch as are flying and and &s;uch as are reptile. It is &s;aid they eat currants.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="035159_0039_100129F34D8E3700">
III. Mo&s;t of our &s;pecies of Picus, or Woodpecker, appear to me to be very u&s;eful in de&s;troying in&s;ects, particularly tho&s;e which injure our fore&s;t and orchard-trees. It is true, the&s;e birds are &s;ometimes injurious to us, by eating &s;ome of our fine&s;t fruits, particularly our cherries, and therefore pains are taken to expell them from our gardens. But they devour va&s;t numbers of in&s;ects, particularly &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;pecies which prove &s;o de&s;tructive to the trunk of the trees, &s;uch as the coleopterous in&s;ects, which, perhaps, do as much mi&s;chief as the caterpillars.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As a devourer of pernicious in&s;ects, one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful birds with which I am acquainted, is the Hou&s;e-Wren, or Certhia familiaris?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Tables, it is called Certhia familiaris <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> This little bird &s;eems peculiarly fond of the &s;ociety of man, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that it is often protected by his intere&s;ted care. From ob&s;erving the u&s;efulne&s;s of this bird in de&s;troying in|&s;ects, it has long been a cu&s;tom, in many parts of our country, to &s;ix a &s;mall box at the end of a long pole in gardens, about hou&s;es, &amp;c. as a place for it to build in. In the&s;e boxes they build and hatch their young. When the young are hatched, the parent birds feed them with a variety of different in&s;ects, particularly &s;uch as are in|jurious in gardens. One of my friends<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kewelder, of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, in Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE> was at the trouble to ob&s;erve the number of times that a pair of the&s;e birds came from their box, and returned with in&s;ects for their young. He found that they did this from forty to &s;ixty times in an hour; and in one particular hour the birds carried food to their young, &s;eventy-one times. In this bu&s;ine&s;s, they were engaged the greater part of the day; &s;ay twelve hours. Taking the medium, therefore, of fifty times an hour, it appeared that a &s;ingle pair of the&s;e birds took from the cabbage, &s;allad, beans, peas, and other vegetables in the garden, at lea&s;t &s;ix hundred in&s;ects in the cour&s;e of one day. This calculation proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the two birds took each only a &s;ingle in&s;ect each time. But it is highly probable they often took &s;everal at a time.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of Certhia of which I am &s;peaking generally hatches twice during the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer. They are very numerous about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the United-States.</P>
<P>The fact ju&s;t related is well calculated to &s;how the importance of attending to the pre&s;ervation of &s;ome of our native birds. The e&s;culent vegetables of a whole garden may, perhaps, be pre&s;erved from the depredations of differ|ent &s;pecies of in&s;ects by ten or fifteen pair of the&s;e &s;mall birds: and independently of this e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, they are an extremely agreeable companion to man: for their note is plea&s;ing. A gentleman, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, thinks he has already reaped much advantage from the &s;ervices of the&s;e Wrens. About his fruit-trees, he has placed a number of boxes for their ne&s;ts. In the&s;e boxes, they very readily breed, and feed them&s;elves and their young with the in&s;ects, which are &s;o de&s;tructive to the various kinds of fruit-trees, and other vegetables.</P>
<P N="5">V. The &s;ervices of the Ibis in devouring the reptiles of Egypt are well known. They procured to this bird a venera|tion and regard which form an intere&s;ting fact in its hi&s;tory, and in the hi&s;tory of human &s;uper&s;titions. The Storks are, perhaps, not le&s;s u&s;eful. Pliny tells us, that the&s;e birds were &s;o much regarded for de&s;troying &s;er|pents, that in The&s;&s;aly, in his age, it was a capital crime to kill them, and that the puni&s;hment was the &s;ame as that for murder. Virgil hints at the u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;tork when he de&s;cribes it as "longis invi&s;a colubris." In Holland, even in our times, they go wild, protected by the government, from a &s;en&s;e of their u&s;efulne&s;s in the way I have mentioned.</P>
<P>In Britain, if it were not for the Herons, and &s;ome other birds of this tribe, the frogs, the toads, and other rep|tiles, would increa&s;e to &s;o great a degree, as to prove a real nui&s;ance. North-America abounds with birds of this order; and we even have &s;ome &s;pecies of Ibis, very nearly allied to the Ibis of Egypt, &s;uch as the Tantalus Loculator, or Wood-Pelecan;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wood Ibis of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnant.</NOTE> the Tantalus ruber, or Scarlet Ibis,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Red Curlew of Cate&s;by.</NOTE> the Tantalus fu&s;cus or Brown Ibis,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Brown Curlew of Cate&s;by.</NOTE> and the Tantalus albus, or White Ibis.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">White Curlew of Cate&s;by.</NOTE> Mr. Bartram informs us, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e birds feeds "on &s;erpents, young alligators, frogs, and other reptiles."<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Travels, &amp;c.

In the mid&s;t of all their &s;uper&s;titions, I do not find, however, that the native Americans have ever paid any par|ticular regard to this bird. I cannot learn that any of the&s;e &s;pecies of Tantalus have ever been &s;een in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>

VI. Some of the birds of the Vultur-kind are extremely u&s;eful to man, by de&s;troying immen&s;e quantities of car|rion, which &s;erve to vitiate the air, and perhaps in &s;ome in&s;tances to give ri&s;e to malignant epidemics. The Vultur Aura, or Turkey-Buzzard of our country, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of the&s;e birds. In Virginia it is protected by a law of that &s;tate. The Abb&eacute; Clavigero &s;peaks of the u&s;efulne&s;s of the <HI>Cozcaquauhtli,</HI> or King of the Zopi|lots, the Vultur Papa of Linnaeus. "The Zopilot, &s;ays this writer, is a mo&s;t u&s;eful bird to that country (Mexico), for they not only clear the fields, but attend the crocodiles and de&s;troy the eggs which the females of tho&s;e dread|ful amphibious animals leave in the &s;and to be hatched by the heat of the &s;un. The de&s;truction of &s;uch a bird ought to be prohibited under &s;evere penalties."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hi&s;tory of Mexico. Vol. 1. P 48.</NOTE></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e few facts, which are thrown together without any regard to order, can be of little u&s;e except in as far as they may turn the attention of other per&s;ons, who po&s;&s;e&s;s more lei&s;ure and information than my&s;elf, to the &s;ubject, which is at once curious and important. It appears to to me be a &s;ubject peculiarly intere&s;ting to my coun|trymen. Perhaps, few parts of the world are more infe&s;ted with noxious in&s;ects than the United-States. The greater number of the&s;e in&s;ects are, I believe, natives of the country, though our partiality to the &s;oil which gave us birth has not always allowed us to acknowledge this truth. Thus we give to the He&s;&s;ians the honour of in|troducing among us that mo&s;t pernicious in&s;ect, the He&s;&s;ian-Fly, which, for &s;everal years, has committed, and &s;till commits, &s;uch alarming ravages on &s;ome of our mo&s;t valuable grains, particularly the Wheat and the Rye. But this in&s;ect is, undoubtedly, a native of America. How it came to be, for &s;o long a time, overlooked, will probably be mentioned in a memoir, concerning this and other noxious in&s;ects, which I hope to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>Many of the pernicious in&s;ects of the United-States &s;eem to be increa&s;ing, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing. Some of the&s;e in&s;ects which originally confined their ravages to the native or wild vegetables, have &s;ince begun their depredations upon the foreign vegetables, which are often more agreeable to their palates. Thus the Bruchus Pi&s;i, or Pea-Fly, is a native, and &s;eems originally to have fed, in a great mea&s;ure unnoticed, upon the indigenous vegetables which are allied to the Pea: but &s;ince the introduction of this la&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;um &s;ativum.</NOTE> among us, it is the principal, if not the only, vege|table which &s;uffers from the ravages of this in&s;ect. The He&s;&s;ian-Fly could not originally have inhabited the Wheat, the Rye, and other &s;imilar gramina of this kind, for the&s;e vegetables are not natives of America. It is now more formidable to us than would be an army of twenty thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, or of any other twenty thou&s;and hirelings, &s;upplied with all the implements of war. The caterpillar, which has begun its ravages upon the leaves of the Lombardy Poplar,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Populus dilat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton.</NOTE> that contributes &s;o much to beautify our city, is mo&s;t probably a native of our woods. It prefers this fine foreigner to the le&s;s palatable leaves upon which it has been formerly accu&s;tomed to feed. Other in&s;tances of this kind might be mentioned. They &s;how how very nece&s;&s;ary it is to watch the migrations of in&s;ects from the native to the introduced vegetables; and they teach us a truth, not I think &s;uffi|ciently attended to by naturali&s;ts, that different kinds of in&s;ects are much le&s;s confined to vegetables of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or to &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus, than has been commonly imagined. It is certain, that the &s;ame &s;pecies of in&s;ects, in America, often feeds indi&s;criminately, and in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, upon plants of very oppo&s;ite genera, and even of very different natural orders.</P>
<P>Hitherto, too little progre&s;s has been made among us in the di&s;covery of remedies for the great mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by in&s;ects. The &s;ubject has not been examined with &s;ufficient attention. It has given place to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions and inquiries of very inferior utility; and I fear it will not claim all that indu&s;trious attention which it &s;o well merits, until the evil &s;hall have &s;pread &s;till farther. It is, doubtle&s;s, difficult, but it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible, to prevent the ravages of noxious in&s;ects. In this important bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;omething has already been done in our country. We have di&s;covered a method of dimini&s;hing the depredations of the little bug, called Cucumber-Fly, which proves &s;o de&s;tructive to the cucurbitaceous vines, particularly tho&s;e of the Cucumber, and Mu&s;k-melon.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the Tables. Page 4.</NOTE> By manuring our wheat-lands, and thereby increa&s;ing the &s;trength and vigour of the wheat, we have le&s;&s;ened the evil of the He&s;&s;ian-Fly. By &s;u&s;pending to our young apple and other trees pieces of tow, impregnated with a mixture of brim&s;tone and train-oil, we have learned how to frighten away the periodical Locu&s;ts (Cicada
<PB N="24" REF="035159_0041_100129FCA9E28CA8">&s;eptem|decim of Linnaeus), which often do &s;o much injury to our orchards.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is only the female Cicada &s;eptemdecim that does mi&s;chief to our orchards, &amp;c.

This may be done without much difficulty, and the operation does not in|jure the tree. Do not the peach-trees &s;uffer more from our late night-fro&s;ts than from in&s;ects? The&s;e night-fro&s;ts, e&s;pecially after rainy whether, in the months of February and March, when the &s;ap is a&s;cending, are certainly very pernicious. They occa&s;ion the bark to crack &s;o that the &s;ap is permitted to run out. I &s;u&s;pect that this is one of the principal cau&s;es of the decay of our peach-trees.</NOTE> We have made &s;ome progre&s;s in preventing the mi&s;chief of the Bruchus Pi&s;i, or Pea-Fly, which proves &s;o de&s;tructive to one of the fine&s;t e&s;culent vegetables. But all that has yet been done is very little compared to that which re|mains to be done. The &s;ubject is as new as it is important.</P>
<P>I am very far from imagining, that the pre&s;ervation of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;pecies of birds which I have mentioned would be the <HI>only</HI> means of guarding again&s;t, or of limiting, the depredations of <HI>any</HI> of our noxious in&s;ects. In a &s;y&s;tem &s;o complex, and &s;o difficult, as this, many agents mu&s;t be employed. Mo&s;t of them have a nece&s;&s;ary connection with the indu&s;try of man, which is an implement that gives him an immen&s;e, an almo&s;t unlimited, command over all the living objects of this earth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is in his power to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the number of animals and vege|tables about him; and even to de&s;troy <HI>whole &s;pecies.</HI> Some of the&s;e means mu&s;t be &s;ugge&s;ted, if they cannot be put into immediate practice, by the ingenuity of philo&s;ophers, or ob&s;ervers. Their &s;peculations will &s;ometimes, per|haps, be trivial, and u&s;ele&s;s. Now and then, their "wild blunders and ri&s;ible ab&s;urdities" (to u&s;e the words of Dr. John&s;on,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to his Dictionary of the Engli&s;h Language.

<P>The few facts which I have mentioned will be &s;ufficient to &s;how, that &s;ome good in the prevention of mi&s;chievous in&s;ects, may be expected from different &s;pecies of birds. Every American farmer's experience will furni&s;h him with &s;ome additional fact in &s;upport of this notion. If careful ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject are made, we &s;hall &s;oon know which are our friends, and which are our enemies: which de&s;erve to be cheri&s;hed and pre&s;erved, and which it will be our intere&s;t to bani&s;h or de&s;troy.</P>

<P>THE preceding "fragmentary rubbi&s;h" (to u&s;e the words of Donne) is thrown upon the public with &s;ome degree of confidence: &mdash;with confidence, merely becau&s;e it regards a country, the natural hi&s;tory of which has hitherto been &s;o little attended to. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, though perhaps the reader will not believe me, that I could render the&s;e pages more worthy of his notice. But I want lei&s;ure. It is this want of lei&s;ure that has prevented me from publi&s;hing a number of tracts, relative to the natural hi&s;tory of North-America, which have long lain in my clo&s;et, in a &s;tate nearly as imperfect as the&s;e very imperfect FRAGMENTS. Whether they will ever be publi&s;hed, will depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon the reception given to the pre&s;ent work.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, I look for, no &s;lattering reception. All I a&s;k, all I require, is to be informed, by tho&s;e who love and &s;tudy nature, that my pre&s;ent labours are not altogether u&s;ele&s;s, and unentertaining.
