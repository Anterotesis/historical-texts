<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF it be true, fellow citizens, that liberty is worth pre&s;erving: that po&s;terity de&s;erves our care; and that abu&s;es in government, are more ea&s;ily &s;ubdued in their infancy, than when time has matured their &s;trength and con&s;ecrated their exi&s;tence; then the &s;ubjects to which we now call your attention, will &s;peak their own propriety, and &s;ufficiently di&s;play their own importance.</P>
<P>We addre&s;s you in the name, and by the order of a &s;ociety, who&s;e members have been &s;elected from your bo&s;oms, and in the various walks of private and public life, have hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and, it is hoped, &s;till continue to de&s;erve your confi|dence: to whom you have committed the impor|tant duties of watching over your intere&s;ts, and repre&s;enting your per&s;ons, in the legi&s;lature of your country; and who would, therefore, be equally ungrateful for your favors, and faithle&s;s to their tru&s;t, were they to remain in &s;ilence, when they conceive your rights to be enfringed, and your liberties in danger.</P>
<P>Actuated by con&s;iderations like the&s;e, and &s;u&s;|pecting, from &s;ome facts within their knowledge, the repre&s;entation in this &s;tate to be unequal and unju&s;t, the individuals who compo&s;e this &s;ociety, applied them&s;elves with attention and care, to ex|amine the &s;ubject. They were &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with its importance. They viewed repre&s;entation
<PB N="ii" REF="027092_0003_0FD33A49EE6C56A0">
as the key &s;tone of liberty. They &s;ought with di+ligence, every &s;ource of information; took pains to a&s;certain facts and inve&s;tigate principles; and found, to their a&s;toni&s;hment, that in this &s;tate, which calls it&s;elf free; in this &s;tate, which even glories in the name of liberty, four fifths of the people are governed by one fifth. They found that the three lower di&s;tricts, which contain only 28,694 white inhabitants, have a much greater number of repre&s;entatives, in both branches of the legi&s;lature, than the &s;ix upper ones, who&s;e numbers amount to 120 902. That Charle&s;ton di&s;trict alone, who&s;e number of white inhabitants is only 15,452, le&s;s than one ninth of the free peo|ple in the &s;tate, elects more than one third of the whole legi&s;lature. That Beaufort di&s;trict, the free inhabitants of which are but 4,364, &s;ends as many members as Ninety-&s;ix, which contains 33 674 white per&s;ons. That Saint Stephen's pa|ri&s;h, with 226 white inhabitants, of all ages and &s;exes, has as many repre&s;entatives as Edgefield county, which can &s;end 2,000 freemen into the field for the defence of their country. That the three upper di&s;tricts of Ninety-&s;ix, Wa&s;hington, and Pinckney, who&s;e whole number of free peo|ple is 74,163, nearly two thirds of the &s;tate, elect only thirty five members for both hou&s;es; but one fourth of the legi&s;lature, which con&s;i&s;ts of 161 per&s;ons, and not as many, by one half, as Charle&s;|ton di&s;trict &s;ends, who&s;e members amount to 61 though its number of white inhabitants is only 15 452. That, con&s;equently, the di&s;trict of Charle&s;ton has twice as much power in all legi&s;la|tive acts, as the three back country di&s;tricts put to|gether, though they contain more than four times its number of free inhabitants. In fine, that the &s;ix upper di&s;tricts, which, by their numbers, are
<PB N="iii" REF="027092_0004_0FD33A4CE8ED0148">
entitled to four fifths of the whole repre&s;entation, po&s;&s;e&s;s, in fact, con&s;iderably le&s;s than one half, and are completely under the dominion of the people below.</P>
<P>Having a&s;certained the&s;e intere&s;ting facts, they next turned their attention to the principles of free government, and enquired whether property ought to influence repre&s;entation. They were &s;peedily led to the following conclu&s;ions, which they regard as fundamental and &s;elf-evident truths, fit to be engraven on the heart, and implicitly o|beyed in the conduct, of every freeman. That equality is the natural condition of man; the ba&s;is of his moral excellence, and political happine&s;s. That although <HI>"equality of conditions"</HI> cannot be pre&s;erved in &s;ociety, <HI>"equality of rights"</HI> is not only con&s;i&s;tent with good government, but forms its only firm and la&s;ting foundation. That to &s;uffer property to be directly repre&s;ented, would de&s;troy this equality, by giving rich men different and more numerous political rights than their neighbours, who&s;e ma&s;ters they would thus be|come. That in the origin of &s;ociety, when that mutual contract, on which all lawful government re&s;ts, was formed, all the contracting parties, that is all the people, were equal, and &s;tipulated to continue &s;o: each individual having, in order to obtain the protection of the re&s;t, agreed to &s;ubject him&s;elf, not to any other individual or &s;et of in|dividuals, but to the whole community. That all &s;uperiority of rights, which &s;ome individuals in &s;ociety have &s;ince obtained over others, are there|fore to be con&s;idered as unju&s;t u&s;urpations, &s;ub|ver&s;ive of liberty and fit to be aboli&s;hed. And, finally, that wealth need not be repre&s;ented for its own protection, &s;ince it will always have power enough, by the influence which it be&s;tows, to
<PB N="iv" REF="027092_0005_0FD33A4E5E2197B0">
protect it&s;elf; and &s;ince the repre&s;entatives, how|ever cho&s;en, will always be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more or le&s;s property, and therefore &s;ufficiently attentive to its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But having often heard attempts made to ju&s;tify the inequality of our repre&s;entation by the &s;uperi|or riches of the lower country, they &s;et them&s;elves next to enquire, whether, even admitting that wealth ought to be con&s;idered in repre&s;entation, the &s;uperiority is &s;o great as to ju&s;tify the exi&s;ting inequality. They found that it is not: that the lower country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only three times the mo&s;t wealth; while the upper country has five times the mo&s;t inhabitants; con&s;equently, that on a joint proportion of wealth and numbers, the principle contended for below, the upper country ought to have the mo&s;t repre&s;entatives, in proportion of five to three; in&s;tead of which it has much the fewe&s;t: only 54 repre&s;entatives and 17 &s;enators; while the lower country has 70 repre&s;entatives and 20 &s;enators.</P>
<P>They &s;aw this inequality, already &s;o enormous, becoming daily greater and more formidable, by the rapid increa&s;e of population and wealth in the upper di&s;tricts; and fore&s;eeing the period, not a very remote one, when this &s;tate, &s;hould the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem remain, mu&s;t be governed by one twentieth of its inhabitants, they could no longer remain in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to explain, prove, and il|lu&s;trate all the&s;e important points, in a &s;eries of let|ters, addre&s;&s;ed to the citizens of this &s;tate, a copy of which is &s;ubjoined to this paper, and the care|ful and attentive peru&s;al whereof they earne&s;tly recommend. In the&s;e letters it was their aim to compri&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary information on the &s;ubject, in the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible compa&s;s; and to treat it in
<PB N="v" REF="027092_0006_0FD33A4FEAF1F908">
a manner the mo&s;t clear and conci&s;e. They ad|dre&s;s them&s;elves to your under&s;tandings, not your pa&s;&s;ions; and wi&s;h to inform and convince, not to inflame. When made acquainted with your rights and your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, it will be with you to decide, whether you will remain as you are, or take &s;teps for a reform: whether you will &s;uffer this evil to &s;trike deeper and deeper into your government, and de&s;troy the liberties of your po&s;terity, perhaps your own, or root it out im|mediately, before it &s;hall become, by age, too &s;trong for your efforts. Should the latter be your determination, this &s;ociety offers you its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There were two objects in its in&s;titution; fir&s;t, to give you the requi&s;ite information on the&s;e &s;ubjects &s;o intere&s;ting to your welfare; &s;econdly, to coun|cil and aid you in any mea&s;ures which you may think proper to adopt for promoting a reform. To the&s;e ends, it has appointed a general commit|tee of corre&s;pondence, the &s;ame that now addre&s;&s;|es you, and a &s;pecial committee in each county, compo&s;ed of per&s;ons whom you know and con|fide in. The&s;e &s;pecial committees are furni&s;hed with the rules, regulations, and proceedings of the &s;ociety, which are to be held open for your in|&s;pection, and will fully explain the objects and nature of the a&s;&s;ociation, and the principles of its members. We invite you to join it; for which nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to &s;ign the rules and re&s;olves. We would al&s;o &s;ubmit to you the propriety of forming &s;imular a&s;&s;ociations in your re&s;pective counties, which may form branches of the general a&s;&s;ociation at Columbia. Should you think this a proper mea&s;ure, our committees will give their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Thus a communication of &s;entiment will be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed throughout the &s;tate; and whatever mea&s;ures you may think proper to adopt, will have all the weight of pub|lic opinion unanimou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="027092_0007_0FD33A516484CCF8">What the&s;e mea&s;ures ought to be, fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> a matter of &s;erious and important con&s;ideration. Weigh them well; and however decidedly you may adopt them, with whatever firmne&s;s they may be &s;upported; they ought to be moderate and regular; &s;uch as the laws will fully ju&s;|tify, and good citizens need never blu&s;h to have pur&s;ued. The power of redre&s;&s;ing the wrongs of which you complain, has been placed by the con&s;titution in the hands of the le|gi&s;lature. To the legi&s;lature therefore you ought to apply for redre&s;s. Approach that re&s;pectable body with a def|ference due to its &s;tation and an unanimity becoming your cau&s;e, and you will be heard. Rely on the ju&s;tice of your fellow citizens below; numbers of whom are probably ig|norant of your claims, and want only to hear them &s;tated, in order to accede to them. Petition; and let your petiti|ons &s;peak a manly, frank, and firm, but a moderate and re&s;pectful language. Repre&s;ent your grievances; but re|pre&s;ent them with clearne&s;s and candour: urge your wi&s;h|es with dutiful mode&s;ty; and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that you will not urge them in vain. Our committees have it in charge to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in drawing up and circulating petitions; and we, on our part, promi&s;e our exertions in bringing them before the legi&s;lature, and &s;upporting them in &s;uch a manner is, we tru&s;t, will not be unworthy of the cau&s;e. Attempts we know have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully made to obtain from the legi&s;lature a partial redre&s;s of the&s;e abu&s;es; but this ill-&s;uc|ce&s;s, we are per&s;uaded, was occa&s;ioned by an opinion in that body that the people in general did not wi&s;h for a change. Refute this opinion by the unanimity of your mea&s;ures. Convince the repre&s;entatives of the people, that the people de&s;ire a reform; and a reform will take place. For we have too much reliance on the ju&s;tice, the patrioti&s;m, and the prudence of tho&s;e who compo&s;e the legi&s;lature of this country, to believe that they will, on any occa&s;ion, much le&s;s on one of &s;uch importance as this, &s;hut their care to the well founded and general complaints of their con|&s;tituents and fellow citizens, when properly expre&s;&s;ed and made known to them.</P>

<P>IT is a truth my fellow citizens, not &s;o obvious as important, that a government may &s;ome|times po&s;&s;e&s;s the form of freedom, without the &s;ub&s;tance. The people often &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves free, becau&s;e they have aimed at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty. They forget, that its principles, unle&s;s &s;kilfully applied, can never produce their proper effect.</P>
<P>Examples of the&s;e truths mo&s;t frequently occur in repre&s;entative governments, which being of a ve|ry complicated &s;tructure, require the mo&s;t exact pro|portion of parts, and are thrown into di&s;order by the &s;malle&s;t derangement. We are &s;truck by the beauty of the machine; we admire the variety and apparent aptne&s;s of its parts; but we overlook, or di&s;regard &s;ome &s;eemingly minute defects, which frequently, but &s;ometimes too late, command our attention, by their de&s;tructive con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Repre&s;entation is a &s;ub&s;titute for popular go|vernment.
<PB N="4" REF="027092_0009_0FD33A559829AF28">
It is now univer&s;ally admitted, that the &s;upreme power re&s;ides in the whole people. In the exerci&s;e of this power, all are equal. For when men enter into &s;ociety, they enter with equal rights; and the portion of independence which each gives up, is relinqui&s;hed to the whole community, not to any of its &s;eperate members. No indivi|dual can be bound, except by the will of all. This will mu&s;t be declared by a majority; in form|ing which; every individual has a right to give his vote; otherwi&s;e he would be a &s;ubject of the go|vernment, not one of its members. When his vote is given, it has as much weight as that of any other member of the &s;ociety. Hence, in the ancient republics, when the &s;pirit of liberty was &s;trong, but the &s;cience of government not far advanced be|yond its fir&s;t principles, all the citizens had a right to a&s;&s;emble, and deliberate in common, on public mea&s;ures. This was called popular government.</P>
<P>But in large &s;ocieties, it is impo&s;&s;ible to convene all the members: even in &s;mall ones, it cannot be done without great inconvenience: and &s;uch a&s;|&s;emblies have ever been found an unfailing &s;ource of public calamities. A method was therefore contrived, of a&s;&s;embling the people by repre&s;enta|tion. The territory which belong to a &s;tate, was divided into di&s;tricts, or the inhabitants into cla&s;&s;es; and a number of repre&s;entatives were cho&s;en, pro|portionate to one or the other, and &s;ometimes, to both of the&s;e divi&s;ions. The &s;upreme power, or certain portions of it, was delegated to tho&s;e repre&s;entatives, who, in the name of their con|&s;tituents, carried on the government. Thus re|pre&s;entative governments were founded.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident that a repre&s;entative govern|ment cannot be free, unle&s;s it be &s;o con&s;tituted,
<PB N="5" REF="027092_0010_0FD33A56C00514C8">
that each member of the community may po&s;&s;e&s;s, by his repre&s;entative, the &s;ame portion of power, in public affairs, that he would have been entitled to him&s;elf, had the government been admini&s;tered by all the people in per&s;on. In the latter ca&s;e, all would be equal; becau&s;e each member would have a right to vote; and one man's vote would count as much as another's. All, therefore, &s;hould be equal by repre&s;entation. Liberty is de&s;troyed, if each individual has not as much power, by the laws, over any other, as that other has over him. If the &s;tate be divided into di&s;tricts, equal in po|pulation, and &s;ome &s;end more repre&s;entatives than others, the government is not free; for the indi|viduals of tho&s;e di&s;tricts, which &s;end the fewe&s;t repre&s;entatives, have le&s;s power than their fellow citizens, and are in a greater or le&s;s degree govern|ed by them. Still farther will liberty be bani&s;hed, if &s;ome di&s;tricts have fewer inhabitants than others, and yet choo&s;e a greater number of repre&s;entatives. But if a ca&s;e &s;hould occur, in which a few &s;mall di&s;tricts, thinly populated, &s;end more repre&s;enta|tives than all the others of which the &s;tate is com|po&s;ed, though much more exten&s;ive, and fuller of inhabitants, then the government, whatever may be its appearance and external form, is a perfect ari&s;tocracy. The very definition of ari&s;tocracy, is a community, where a &s;mall part of the people have the power of making laws to bind the re&s;t. This &s;mall part may exerci&s;e its power in per&s;on or by repre&s;entatives; but the government is &s;till the &s;ame. A &s;tate in which one fifth of the peo|ple can make laws to bind the other four fifths, cannot be free. It may be a mild ari&s;tocracy; from particular circum&s;tances it may long conti|nue &s;o: but it is an ari&s;tocracy &s;till; and &s;ooner or
<PB N="6" REF="027092_0011_0FD33A5934EB7858">
later, will produce all the bitter fruits of that hateful and pernicious weed.</P>
<P>Since then my fellow citizens, a repre&s;entative government requires &s;uch nicety in its con&s;tructi|on, and may be &s;o ea&s;ily perverted; &s;ince liberty may be de&s;troyed by &s;uch &s;mall deviations from principle; &s;urely it is an object de&s;erving the at|tention of enlightened patrioti&s;m, to enquire, whether &s;ome abu&s;e has not crept into our &s;y&s;|tem.&mdash;Such an enquiry I propo&s;e to undertake; it will be carried on through a &s;eries of letters, in which the following points will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: 1. Whether on the principle of numbers, the citi|zens of South-Carolina are equally repre&s;ented in the &s;tate government? 2. Whether property ought to influence repre&s;entation? 3. Whether our repre&s;entation is equal on the principle of pro|perty rightly under&s;tood? 4. If an inequality &s;hould be found to exi&s;t, how it was introduced? 5. What is the peculiar nature of this inequality? And la&s;tly, what are its effects on liberty?</P>
<P>Let not this enquiry be con&s;idered as u&s;ele&s;s. I know, that under our pre&s;ent form of govern|ment whatever may be its effects, we enjoy a great portion of liberty and equality. But pre&s;ent health is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;eeds of di&s;|ea&s;e. Preventive medicines are be&s;t. And the &s;ure&s;t method of perpetuating the ble&s;&s;ings of a &s;y&s;tem, is to find out and remove its imperfecti|on.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t object propo&s;ed for enquiry, is, whether the citizens of this &s;tate enjoy, in
<PB N="7" REF="027092_0012_0FD33A5B1E8F6CE0">
the &s;tate government, an equal repre&s;entation, on the principle of numbers? Here our &s;ure&s;t guide will be the cen&s;us, and the li&s;t of repre&s;entatives, as &s;ettled by the con&s;titution. By comparing them, the que&s;tion may be decided with ea&s;e and cer|tainty.</P>
<P>The &s;tate may be con&s;idered under a threefold divi&s;ion: fir&s;t, into upper and lower country; &s;econdly into di&s;tricts; and thirdly into counties and pari&s;hes. The lower country extends along the coa&s;t, from Georgia to North-Carolina, and about fifty or &s;ixty miles back from the &s;ea. It includes the di&s;tricts of Georgetown, Beaufort and Charle&s;ton, and is divided into pari&s;hes. The upper country takes in the re&s;t of the &s;tate, to the borders of North-Carolina, and the Indian boun|dary. It contains the di&s;tricts of Orangeburgh, Camden, Cheraw, Ninety-&s;ix, Pinckney, and Wa&s;hington, which are &s;ubdivided into counties.</P>
<P>Charle&s;ton di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of the following pa|ri&s;hes: Saint Michael's and Saint Phillip's, inclu|ding Charle&s;ton, and containing 8,089 white inha|bitants; Saint Bartholomew 2,133; Saint John's, Berkley 692; Saint George's, Dorche&s;ter 1,252; Saint Stephen's 226, Saint James' Santee 437; Saint Thomas' 397; Chri&s;t Church 566; Saint James's, Goo&s;e creek 439; Saint John's, Colle|ton 585; Saint Andrew's 370; and Saint Paul's 276. This gives Charle&s;ton di&s;trict 15,452 white inhabitants. That di&s;trict &s;ends 48 repre&s;entatives, 15 from Saint Michael's and Saint Phillip's, and three from each of its other pari&s;hes: it has al&s;o 13 &s;enators.</P>
<P>Beaufort di&s;trict includes 4 pari&s;hes; Saint Hele|na, Saint Lukes, Prince William, and Saint Peter's. Its number of white inhabitants is 4,364; and it
<PB N="8" REF="027092_0013_0FD33A5D1290BB38">
&s;ends 12 repre&s;entatives; 3 from each pari&s;h: it has four &s;enators.</P>
<P>Georgetown di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of 3 pari&s;hes; Prince Georges, All-Saints, and Prince Frederics; containing together, 8,878 white inhabitants; It &s;ends ten repre&s;entatives and three &s;enators.</P>
<P>The white inhabitants of the lower country, therefore, amount to 28,694; its number of re|pre&s;entatives is &s;eventy; and it has twenty &s;ena|tors.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Ninety-&s;ix has four counties; Edgefield, containing 9,785 white inhabitants, Abbeville 7,495, Laurens 8,210, and Newberry 8,186; Ninety-&s;ix di&s;trict then has 33,674 white inhabitants; and its number of repre&s;entatives is twelve, three for each county; it has four &s;ena|tors. The &s;ame number of both, with Beaufort di&s;trict, which contains only 4,364 white inhabit|ants; le&s;s than one &s;eventh of the number in Ninety-&s;ix. Hence it is plain that one free man in Beaufort di&s;trict, has as much power in our go|vernment, as &s;even free men in Ninety-&s;ix.</P>
<P>Charle&s;ton di&s;trict contains 15,452 white inha|bitants; Ninety-&s;ix, 33,674; more than double; yet Ninety-&s;ix di&s;trict &s;ends twelve members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and Charle&s;ton forty-eight, exactly four times as many. A free man, in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, therefore, has eight times as much influence in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, as a free man in Ninety-&s;ix. In the &s;enate, the di&s;|proportion is not quite &s;o great. Ninety-&s;ix has four members, and Charle&s;ton di&s;trict thirteen; &s;omething more than three times the number; &s;o that, in the &s;enate, a free man of Charle&s;ton has only &s;ix times as much power as one of Ninety-&s;ix.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="027092_0014_0FD33A5E13FB2C60">
Pendleton and Greenville; the former con|tains 8,731 white inhabitants; the latter 5,888; in all 14 619; within le&s;s than a thou&s;and of the numbers in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, which are 15,452; yet Wa&s;hington &s;ends five members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and two &s;enators. Charle&s;ton &s;ends forty eight to the former, and thirteen to the latter; more than eight times the number &s;ent by Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>Pinckney di&s;trict contains four counties: Union, which has 6,430 white inhabitants; Spartanburgh 7,907; York 5,652; and Che&s;ter 5881; amount|ing, in the whole, to 25,870. Each of tho&s;e counties &s;ends two members to the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives, except York, which has three; this makes 9 in all. 25,870 inhabitants in Pinckney, &s;end 9 members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. Four thou&s;and three hundred and &s;ixty four in Beaufort, &s;end twelve; and in Charle&s;ton fifteen thou&s;and four hundred and fifty-two, &s;end forty-eight; &s;o that a free man in Charle&s;ton or Beaufort di&s;tricts, has at the lea&s;t &s;even times as much pow|er in the government, as a free man in Pinckney. This di&s;trict &s;ends three &s;enators, Charle&s;ton thir|teen, and Beaufort four.</P>
<P>In Camden di&s;trict there were five counties, at the time of the cen&s;us: Fairfield, Richland, Cla|rendon, Claremont, and Lanca&s;ter. A new one, Ker&s;haw, has lately been erected. Fairfield has five thou&s;and one hundred and thirty-eight white inhabitants; Richland two thou&s;and four hundred and &s;eventy-nine; Clarendon one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety; Claremont two thou&s;and four hundred and thirty-eight; and Lanca&s;ter four thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;ixty-four. This is the enumeration by the cen&s;us; but it is thought to
<PB N="10" REF="027092_0015_0FD33A6094E457C8">
be much too low. It gives Camden, however, &s;ix|teen thou&s;and &s;even hundred and nine white inha|bitants; above one thou&s;and more than Charle&s;ton di&s;trict contains; yet Camden di&s;trict &s;ends but twelve members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; two for each of the above-mentioned five counties, and two for Ker&s;haw; whereas, Charle&s;ton &s;ends forty-eight; ju&s;t four times the number. The di&s;|proportion in &s;enators is &s;till greater; Camden &s;ends but three, and Charle&s;ton thirteen.</P>
<P>Orangeburgh di&s;trict, contains 12,412 white in|habitants; and it &s;ends ten members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and three &s;enators. Beaufort has 4,364 inhabitants, &s;omething more than one third of the numbers of Orangeburgh, and it elects twelve repre&s;entatives and four &s;enators. Charle&s;|ton has 15,452 white inhabitants; about 3000 more than Orangeburgh, and yet it elects very near|ly five times as many repre&s;entatives, and more than four times the number of &s;enators.</P>
<P>In the di&s;trict of Cheraw there are 7,618 white inhabitants; it &s;ends &s;ix members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and two &s;enators.</P>
<P>Throwing the di&s;tricts of Ninety-&s;ix, Wa&s;h|ington, Pinckney, Camden, Orangeburgh, and Cheraw, into the upper country divi&s;ion, it is found to contain 120,902 white inhabitants; it &s;ends 54 members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and 17 &s;enators. The lower country, including the three di&s;tricts of Charle&s;ton, Beaufort and Georgetown, contains 28,694 white inhabitants, and it elects 70 repre&s;entatives and twenty &s;ena|tors. Divide 149,596, the whole number in the &s;tate by 28,694, tho&s;e of the lower country, and the re&s;ult will be more that five, from whence it appears, that a large majority of both branches of
<PB N="11" REF="027092_0016_0FD33A62AC457348">
the legi&s;lature, is elected by le&s;s than one fifth of the people. This one fifth therefore governs the other four fifths, and the &s;tate is an ari&s;tocracy. 28,000 citizens by their repre&s;entatives, can make laws to bind 120,000, without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>If you take away Georgetown di&s;trict from the lower country, &s;till the two remaining ones, Charle&s;ton and Beaufort will have &s;ixty repre&s;enta|tives and 17 &s;enators, a greater number of repre|&s;entatives and as many &s;enators as the whole upper country together, which has only fifty-four of the fir&s;t and &s;eventeen of the latter: and if you add Georgetown di&s;trict to the upper country divi&s;ion, the latter will even then have but a very &s;mall ma|jority; &s;ixty-four repre&s;entatives to &s;ixty, and twenty &s;enators to &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>Thus the two di&s;tricts of Charle&s;ton and Beau|fort, which contain but 19,866 white inhabitants, not more than one &s;ixth of our whole numbers, can neverthele&s;s, with the addition of three repre|&s;entatives and two &s;enators from the other di&s;tricts, govern the whole &s;tate&mdash;can make laws, rai&s;e tax|es, appoint officers of government, and exerci&s;e all other functions of &s;upreme power over the other five &s;ixths, how much &s;oever they may be oppre&s;&s;|ed by the mea&s;ures adopted, or how firmly &s;oever oppo&s;ed to them. Such a government may be a|mu&s;ed with the form of freedom, but it would be difficult to prove that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The whole &s;tate contains 149,596 white inha|bitants. Of this number 15,452 not quite one ninth, re&s;ide in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives con&s;i&s;ts of 124 members, and the &s;e|nate of thirty-&s;even; of the&s;e Charle&s;ton di&s;trict elects forty-eight repre&s;entatives and thirteen &s;e|nators. Con&s;equently Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, with
<PB N="12" REF="027092_0017_0FD33A64CFE14AD8">
le&s;s than one ninth of the inhabitants in the &s;tate, elects more than a third of the legi&s;lature. It &s;ends very nearly as many members to both hou&s;es, as all the upper country together, though it has not one &s;ixth of the numbers. Charle&s;ton di&s;trict has 15,452 white inhabitants, forty-eight repre&s;enta|tives, and thirteen &s;enators. The &s;ix upper coun|try di&s;tricts have 120,902 white inhabitants, fifty-four repre&s;entatives, and &s;eventeen &s;enators. So that in all legi&s;lative que&s;tions 15,452 citizens, who happen to re&s;ide in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, have, with|in a very little, as much power in the government as 120,902 who inhabit other parts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Here the greater number is evidently &s;ubjected to the power of the &s;maller, and a much &s;maller too; which is the mo&s;t exact definition that can be given of an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>If we compare particular pari&s;hes in the lower with particular counties in the upper country, the inequality of repre&s;entation will &s;trike us &s;till more forcibly. Thus, for in&s;tance, Saint Paul's pari&s;h, in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, contains two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix white inhabitants, and this pari&s;h &s;ends three repre&s;entatives and one &s;enator. Edgefield county, in Ninety-&s;ix di&s;trict, has 9,785 white in|habitants. It al&s;o &s;ends three repre&s;entatives and one &s;enator. The county has above thirty-nine times as many white inhabitants as the pari&s;h. Yet they &s;end an equal number of members to the le|gi&s;lature. Con&s;equently, one freeman in Saint Paul's pari&s;h, has more influence in the government than thirty-nine freemen in Edgefield county.</P>
<P>Pendleton county, in Wa&s;hington di&s;trict, con|tains 8,731 white inhabitants. The pari&s;h of St. Stephen's, in Charle&s;ton di&s;trict, 226; Saint Ste|phen's pari&s;h &s;ends three repre&s;entatives and one
<PB N="13" REF="027092_0018_0FD33A69F660E600">
&s;enator. Pendleton county the &s;ame number of each. It follows that one freeman in this pari&s;h, has as much power in the goverment, as thirty-eight freemen in Pendleton county.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t populous counties in the up|per country. And Saint Stephen's and Saint Paul's are the lea&s;t populous pari&s;hes below; they were cho&s;en to make the contra&s;t more &s;triking. But in many other in&s;tances, the di&s;proportion be|tween numbers and repre&s;entation, is nearly as great; in all it is very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>From all this, it appears, that the citizens of South-Carolina, are very far from being equally repre&s;ented in the &s;tate government on the princi|ple of numbers. On the contrary, it is evident, that a con&s;iderable majority of the legi&s;lature is elected by le&s;s than one fifth of the people; which one fifth con&s;equently governs the other four fifths. In the next number I &s;hall proceed to enquire, whether any other principle, than that of num|bers, ought to be admitted in the apportionment of repre&s;entation.</P>

<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE order of my &s;ubject leads me next to enquire, whether repre&s;entation ought to be affected by wealth?</P>
<P>It is admitted by all, that the lower country contains far more wealth, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, than the upper coun|try. Should it appear that property ought to be regarded in apportioning the repre&s;entation, a great part of the inequality, which exi&s;ts in our government, might be ju&s;tified on that principle.
<PB N="14" REF="027092_0019_0FD33A6BE3E06708">
But I apprehend that a very little con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject will be &s;ufficient to convince us, that no principle can be more void of foundation, or lead to more de&s;tructive con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Society is prior to property. In a &s;tate of na|ture each individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es what he can enjoy at the time, and no more. When he goes out of his cave another comes into it with as good a right as his predece&s;&s;or, and in his turn is &s;ucceeded by a third occupant, who holds by the &s;ame title as the former. If he &s;hould find a fruit tree, he claims a right to as much fruit as he can pluck and carry away. The re&s;t remains &s;o the next comer. In a &s;tate like this no property can be accumulated. The &s;ingle efforts of one individual can do nothing more than &s;upply his own immediate wants: and when a number of &s;uch individuals a&s;&s;emble for mutual defence, or from any other motives, no one brings into the community more than his per|&s;onal &s;trength and labour. All are equal in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and rights; and for a con&s;iderable time whatever they acquire continues to be in com|mon. At length, however, as &s;ociety advances, and the under&s;tandings of men are improved by longer experience, it is di&s;covered, that in order to encourage indu&s;try and enterprize, each indivi|dual mu&s;t be &s;ecured, in the &s;eparate enjoyment of what he can procure, by his labour or inge|nuity. Hence rules are made for the &s;ecurity of property. Wealth encrea&s;es by the united efforts of a &s;ociety, who&s;e members mutually aid each other, while each is pur&s;uing his own advantage; and &s;ome being more indu&s;trious, more &s;kilful, or more fortunate than others, accumulate to them&s;elves a greater portion, of what the labour of all is employed in producing.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="027092_0020_0FD33A6D132682F8">Property then being a more creature of govern|ment and laws, can have no influence in their original formation. To deny this would be to contend that an effect might be in&s;trumental in producing its cau&s;e, or that a plant had produced the very &s;eed from which it &s;prung.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we find, that in all the&s;e early go|vernments, which were formed on the principles of freedom, all the members, however different in property, talents or influence, were equal in political rights. In an a&s;&s;embly of the people at Athens, the lowe&s;t mechanic, or labourer, had a vote. Themi&s;tocles, Cimon, or Pericles, had no more. And in the democratic a&s;&s;emblies at Rome, the poore&s;t citizen was equal to Scipio, or Julius Cae&s;ar in the right of &s;uffrage.</P>
<P>But repre&s;entative governments are &s;ub&s;titutes for the&s;e popular a&s;&s;emblies, where all the citizens are convened, and each has a right to vote. As wealth gives no preference in one, it ought not to give it in the other.</P>
<P>It is a never failing property of wealth to accu|mulate in particular hands. In all well regulated &s;ocieties, &s;ome few will be very rich, a con&s;ider|able number in moderate circum&s;tances, and far the greater part comparatively poor. Suppo&s;e that the government remains in the hands of all the people, who a&s;&s;emble, in per&s;on, to delibe|rate and decide upon public mea&s;ures. If you &s;ay that a citizen, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es twice as much as ano|ther, &s;hall have twice as many votes, the govern|ment cannot be free, becau&s;e a much &s;maller number, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing two votes each, can govern a much greater, each of whom has but one. If you pur&s;ue the principle, a citizen who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ten times as much as another, mu&s;t have ten times
<PB N="16" REF="027092_0021_0FD325E2B03C7708">
as many votes. Suppo&s;e the community to con|&s;i&s;t of 10,000 members; it may well happen that 1,000 of the&s;e will collectively po&s;&s;e&s;s as much wealth as the other 9,000, perhaps more. In that ca&s;e this 1,000 will govern the community; and the &s;tate will be an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>If the government be repre&s;entative, this prin|ciple will &s;till produce the &s;ame effect. In the in|&s;tance mentioned above, &s;uppo&s;e that the people, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;embling to vote in per&s;on, &s;hould choo&s;e repre&s;entatives. If the 1,000 rich citizens choo&s;e ten times as many repre&s;entatives, in pro|portion to their numbers, as the 9000 poor ones, the former will have the greate&s;t number of repre|&s;entatives, and will continue to govern the whole &s;tate. The only difference is, that in&s;tead of ru|ling in per&s;on, they do it by their repre&s;entatives. Con&s;equently, if wealth has any influence on re|pre&s;entation, the government cannot be free. It is further removed from liberty, in proportion as this influence becomes greater. Whenever it be|comes &s;o great, that a &s;mall number of citizens, on account of their wealth, have more votes, ei|ther in per&s;on or by repre&s;entatives, than all the others, the government is an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>But it is &s;ometimes &s;aid, that property ought to have the power of protecting it&s;elf&mdash;That the poor being the mo&s;t numerous in all &s;ocieties, would, if they had equal power in the govern|ment with the rich, &s;acrifice the&s;e latter to their envy or their avarice.&mdash;And that to guard again&s;t this evil, property ought to be repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This amounts to &s;aying, in the fir&s;t place, that every government ought to be ari&s;tocratic; for no community can be free, when a &s;mall number of its members po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, no matter for what rea|&s;on,
<PB N="17" REF="027092_0022_0FD33A719A7233E0">
more power in the government than all the re&s;t together. This is evident from the principles already e&s;tabli&s;hed. If wealth mu&s;t be repre&s;ent|ed, a free government cannot exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, wealth will always acquire influence enough in every government to protect it&s;elf. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it commonly have a better education, more exten&s;ive means of acquiring knowledge, and improving their talents, more lei&s;ure for attending to public affairs, better opportunities of making friends, e&s;tabli&s;hing connections and forming parties. A rich citizen, without having more votes, or choo&s;ing more repre&s;entatives than his poor neighbours, will very &s;peedily obtain ten times as much influence in the government. In|&s;tead of giving him more votes, you &s;hould give him fewer, in order to ballance and check that ten|dency to inequality, which exi&s;ts in every &s;ociety, and is its mo&s;t dangerous ingredient. You can|not prevent one man from acquiring more wealth than others. You cannot prevent this wealth from uniting it&s;elf with talents, and obtaining influ|ence. But you ought to counteract this di&s;po&s;ition as much as po&s;&s;ible. Strip wealth of as many ad|vantages as you can, &s;till it will have enough, and more than enough. But if in addition to its natural and inevitable influence, you give it con|&s;titutional power in the government; then in&s;tead of checking, you favor and promote the tendency of &s;ociety to its mo&s;t dangerous di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thirdly, no &s;ociety is, or can be divided into very rich and very poor members. There will be a great variety of intermediate cla&s;&s;es, ri&s;ing in regular gradation, from the lowe&s;t to the mo&s;t opulent. The&s;e middle cla&s;&s;es indeed form the bulk of every community. As they are all po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="027092_0023_0FD33A75F31C4A20">
of more or le&s;s property, they are all inter|e&s;ted in its pre&s;ervation; and while they enact ju&s;t laws, for the &s;ecurity of their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they equally protect tho&s;e of the riche&s;t members.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, the repre&s;entatives, what|ever may be the &s;ituation of their con&s;tituents, will always be men of more or le&s;s property: on &s;uch the people naturally fix their choice; they will carry with them into the government, not only the feelings and views of their con&s;tituents, but their own al&s;o&mdash;this will en&s;ure a &s;ufficient re|gard to the rights of property. Repre&s;entatives who po&s;&s;e&s;s wealth them&s;elves, whatever their con&s;tituents might do were they a&s;&s;embled in per|&s;on, will never make laws for &s;ubjecting property to unju&s;t burdens. There is more danger of their con&s;ulting their own intere&s;ts at the expence of their con&s;tituents. Thus it appears, that repre&s;en|tation, however equal on the principle of numbers, is, in its very nature, nece&s;&s;arily conducive to the pre&s;ervation of property.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if the rights of property could not be protected, without giving it a &s;hare in repre&s;enta|tion, there could be no occa&s;ion for its having that &s;hare in more than one branch of the legi&s;lature. The u&s;e of two hou&s;es, or &s;eperate branches, is that one may operate as a check upon the other; &s;o as to prevent improper mea&s;ures from being adop|ted through ha&s;te or ra&s;hne&s;s. If property be re|pre&s;ented in the &s;enate, it will be &s;ecure: for no legi&s;lative act can be done without the &s;enates con|currence. Be&s;ides, if property be repre&s;ented in one branch, the per&s;onal rights of the people &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the other. Of con&s;e|quence, one man's per&s;onal rights being as great as another's, the repre&s;entation, in one branch at
<PB N="19" REF="027092_0024_0FD33A7792CCE590">
lea&s;t, ought to be equal on the principle of num|bers. The truth is, that it ought to be &s;o in both branches; for property will always be &s;ecure and formidable, though you give it no con&s;titutional advantages; and to allow it any is contrary to eve|ry ju&s;t principle of free government.</P>
<P>It is further alledged, that as wealthy men con|tribute mo&s;t to the &s;upport of government, they ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t number of its ad|vantages.</P>
<P>And they do po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t number. Why does a rich man pay more to government than a poor one? Becau&s;e he has more to pay with. Is it not from government and laws that he derives his wealth? Do they not protect him in the exclu|&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? What but their influence and authority prevents his riches from being &s;eized by men &s;tronger than he is, and who want perhaps for the &s;upply of their nece&s;&s;ities, what he di&s;&s;i|pates in gratifying the mo&s;t idle, perhaps the mo&s;t vicious appetites? Will any one affirm, that a wealthy man enjoys no greater portion of the ad|vantages of &s;ociety than a poor one? What is the re&s;pect and influence which riches be&s;tow? What are the plea&s;ures of affluence and ea&s;e? What is the power of conferring obligations, rendering &s;ervices, and relieving di&s;tre&s;s? Are not the&s;e advantages? Do not rich men enjoy them in a much higher degree than tho&s;e in more narrow circum&s;tances? and is it not perfectly rea&s;onable, that as they have more to pay with, and more to be protected, they &s;hould pay a greater portion of the price of protection?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it is not true, that the rich contribute more than the poor. All contribute equally, be|cau&s;e all pay in proportion to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that
<PB N="20" REF="027092_0025_0FD33A79118F9718">
is to their means of payment. If I po&s;&s;e&s;s 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and another per&s;on ten thou&s;and, he pays 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and I pay ten. The &s;um which he pays is the large&s;t, but my ten pounds is as much for me, and as difficult for me to pay as his hundred, and as I pay le&s;s, &s;o I have fewer advantages, and le&s;s property to be protected than he has.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that becau&s;e one citizen is richer than another, and in a general and equal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of property, pays a larger &s;um towards the expence of government, he ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s greater po|litical privileges, and more power in the enacting of laws, which are to bind both equally; amounts to &s;aying, that becau&s;e a man is poor he ought to be a &s;lave; that there ought to be no &s;uch thing as a free con&s;titution; in fine, that every govern|ment ought to be an ari&s;tocracy, in which the rich might domineer at plea&s;ure over their fellow citi|zens. Pre&s;ent the idea in this form, which is its true one, and it becomes too horrid to be dwelt upon; yet when di&s;gui&s;ed by a little &s;ophi&s;try, it is made one of the chief arguments to &s;upport an unequal repre&s;entation. From all this it is evident, that property ought to have no influence on the number of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>We are next to enquire, whether, even on the &s;cale of property, the citizens of this &s;tate are equally repre&s;ented.&mdash;This will be the &s;ubject of the following number.</P>

<P>IN the la&s;t number, my fellow citizens, we con|tended, that property ought to have no influ|ence on repre&s;entation. We will now admit, for a moment, the contrary po&s;ition, and enquire whe|ther on the principle of property, rightly under|&s;tood,
<PB N="21" REF="027092_0026_0FD33A7B12667300">
the citizens of this &s;tate are equally repre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>Here, in&s;tead of the cen&s;us, we will take the tax returns. By comparing them with the li&s;t of repre&s;entatives and &s;enators, we may quickly &s;olve the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that from various cau&s;es, the&s;e returns are very inaccurate. It frequently happens, that people re&s;iding in one county or pari&s;h, po&s;&s;e&s;s property in others; and yet make all their returns where they live. Hence one pa|ri&s;h or county often appears to be much more rich, and another much poorer, than it is in reali|ty.

<P>No body contends, that wealth alone ought to be con&s;idered in apportioning the repre&s;entation. Such a principle is too mon&s;trous to be endured for a moment. The mo&s;t violent &s;tickler for ari&s;|tocracy and the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, have never ven|tured upon that ground. To contend for it would be to attempt the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a pure ari&s;tocra|cy
<PB N="23" REF="027092_0028_0FD33A82D33CAEC0">
of the rich; a de&s;ire of which, nobody has hi|therto been found &s;o &s;hamele&s;s as to avow. The &s;up|porters of our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, contend, that repre|&s;entation ought to be in a joint ratio of wealth and numbers&mdash;each di&s;trict, &s;ay they, &s;hould have a number of repre&s;entatives, in proportion, not to numbers alone, or to wealth alone, but to a joint proportion of wealth and numbers. That is, if one di&s;trict or county has three times as many in|habitants as the other, and that other is three times the riche&s;t, they ought to have an equal number of repre&s;entatives; becau&s;e, the advantage of &s;u|perior numbers on one &s;ide, is counter-ballanced by the advantages of &s;uperior wealth on the other. Let us for a moment admit, though the contrary has been clearly proved, that this is a ju&s;t principle. Let us apply it to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and &s;ee what will be the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The lower country, as we have already &s;een, contains 28,694 white inhabitants, and pays &pound;. 28,081 5<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>d.</ABBR> tax. The upper country con|tains 120,902 white inhabitants, and pays &pound;.8,390 13<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3<ABBR>d.</ABBR> tax. The former pays three times as much tax; the latter has five times as many free|men. If the lower country exceeded the upper as much in amount of taxes, as the upper country ex|ceeds it in number of inhabitants, the proportion would be equal, and they &s;hould have an equal num|ber of repre&s;entatives. The &s;uperiority of numbers on one &s;ide, being compen&s;ated, in that ca&s;e, by the advantage of wealth on the other. But the &s;upe|riority of numbers in the upper country, five to one, greatly out-weighs the &s;uperiority of tax below; which is only three to one. Con&s;equently, on the principle contended for, a joint proportion of wealth and numbers, the upper country ought to

exceed the lower in number of repre&s;entatives, in the proportion of five to three; and &s;hould have at lea&s;t one fourth the mo&s;t members in both hou|&s;es: In&s;tead of which it has nearly one third the fewe&s;t.</P>
<P>On the principle of property therefore, in the only &s;en&s;e in which it is or can be contended for, as well as on that of numbers, the only true one, our repre&s;entation, is exceedingly unequal. We are next to enquire into the origin of this inequality.</P>

<P>IN the preceeding numbers, my fellow citizens, it has been proved, that you are not equally repre&s;ented in the &s;tate government. The &s;ix up|per di&s;tricts are entitled, by their &s;uperior populati|on, to four fifths of the whole repre&s;entation, in|&s;tead of which they have le&s;s than one half. Even the principle of property, combined with numbers, gives them a right to one third more repre&s;enta|tives than they now elect. We are next to con|&s;ider the origin of this inequality.</P>
<P>The &s;ea coa&s;t of South-Carolina was &s;ettled many years before the interior country had been explored. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were Europeans, who would naturally form their e&s;tabli&s;hments near the &s;ea. The tide flows but a very &s;hort di&s;tance up the rivers. There are few, if any, in&s;tances in which it exceeds 30 miles. Con&s;equently naviga|on and commerce would at fir&s;t be confined entirely to the &s;ea coa&s;t. The country, for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance above the tides-way, is low, wet, and barren; affording no inducements to early &s;ettlers, and even now very thinly inhabited. For many
<PB N="25" REF="027092_0030_0FD33A867007B338">
years after the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments were formed, &s;ome ho&s;tile tribes of Indians maintained their ground in the neighbuorhood of the coa&s;t, and prevented the new &s;ettlements from extending far into the interior country. All that is now called the back country, and even the middle di&s;tricts, were for a long time held by the &s;avages; early in the &s;ettlements, the culture of rice was introduced, and &s;oon became the great object of enterpri&s;e and indu&s;try. The only lands proper for the production of this grain, are &s;ituated near the &s;ea&mdash;wealth and population rapidly encrea&s;ed; and all the&s;e circum&s;tances united to confine them to a few leagues along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;tate of the colony that its fir&s;t government was formed. The lower country flouri&s;hing and wealthy; the middle either wholly un&s;ettled, or containing a few indigent and &s;cat|tered inhabitants; and the more remote interior parts, now called the back country, entirely un|known, or occupied by &s;avages. This government con&s;i&s;ted, in part, of an a&s;&s;embly elected by the people. The elections was made by pari&s;hes, into a number of which the colony was divided. In this divi&s;ion the middle country was little regard|ed; the back country being almo&s;t or quite un|known, was wholly over looked: in&s;omuch that &s;ome of the pari&s;hes extended from the &s;ea to the mountains, while the place of election was at the pari&s;h church, within a few miles from the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The few &s;cattered back &s;ettlers, as the inhabi|tants at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea were then called might come down and vote if they thought pro|per: but it never was expected, and &s;eldom done.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="027092_0031_0FD33A88113B06A8">In proce&s;s of time, the back country began to be peopled by emigrations from the interior parts of North-Carolina, Virginia, and Pen&s;ylvania. Some numerous &s;ettlements were gradually form|ed; but the rich and refined inhabitants below, either knew nothing of them, or con&s;idered them as hordes of rude hunters, little &s;uperior to &s;avages. They were of no importance in the goverment; no change was on their account made in the repre&s;en|tation. The members of the legi&s;lature were elected by the pari&s;hes, and a&s;&s;embled in Charle&s;|ton. At the &s;ame place the courts of ju&s;tice were held; and if a man of Long Canes, or Paco|let, was &s;ued, brought an action, or was indicted for an offence, he and his witne&s;&s;es were forced to attend in Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>The people of the back country becoming daily more and more numerous, began to be &s;en&s;ible of their &s;trength, and loudly complained of this une|qual di&s;tribution of the advantages of government. At length in the year 1769, more than 100 years after the colony was planted, they, with much diffi|culty, obtained an act for e&s;tabli&s;hing courts in vari|ous parts of the country. Still they were little re|garded in elections. A few of the mo&s;t popular men among them &s;ometimes obtained &s;eats, but the number was &s;mall and precarious. Almo&s;t the whole hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives was cho&s;en by the people below. The elections were &s;till made by pari&s;hes; and a leading man from the back coun|try, had no method of getting him&s;elf elected, but to bring down a &s;ufficient number of his neighbours, to give him a majority of votes. The fir&s;t in&s;tance of this happened about 30 years ago. The peo|ple of Long Canes, who were included in the pa|ri&s;h of Saint Bartholomews, came down in a body
<PB N="27" REF="027092_0032_0FD33A8C07F69AD0">
to an election, and put in one of their neighbours. This gentleman, the fir&s;t inhabitant of the upper country, that ever obtained a &s;eat in the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, is &s;till alive. So long was it before the rights of the upper country began to be re|garded.</P>
<P>This inequality of repre&s;entation continued to exi&s;t at the revolution. The popular a&s;&s;emblies, which made the fir&s;t regular oppo&s;ition to the Bri|ti&s;h government, were elected by the pari&s;hes in the u&s;ual manner. A few of the principal men in the upper country obtained &s;eats; but their number was &s;mall, and their influence incon&s;iderable. When the province at length completely threw off its dependence, and began to form a government of its own, no convention of the people was called for that purpo&s;e; but the a&s;&s;embly, which, till then had exerci&s;ed the legi&s;la|tive powers, pa&s;&s;ed an act containing a form of government. This in&s;trument apportioned the number of repre&s;entatives in &s;uch a manner, as to give the back country a &s;hare greater than it had before; but &s;till very inadequate to its population. As it had however but a very &s;mall number of re|pre&s;entatives, and of cour&s;e, very little power in the a&s;&s;embly which formed the &s;y&s;tem. It was forced to &s;ubmit to the conditions impo&s;ed on it, and glad to accept &s;uch advantages, however &s;mall, as it could obtain. Be&s;ides it was, probably un|acquainted with its own &s;trength; nor was the in|equality of numbers as great then as it has &s;ince become. Thus was a &s;y&s;tem formed and acqui|e&s;ced in, which gave the three di&s;tricts of Charle&s;|ton, Beaufort and Georgetown, more repre&s;enta|tives than were allotted to all the re&s;t of the &s;tate. In the year 1789, the legi&s;lature re&s;olved to call a
<PB N="28" REF="027092_0033_0FD33A8ED1762378">
convention of the people. To revi&s;e and amend the con&s;titution was the object of this a&s;&s;embly. When the motion for calling it was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the legi&s;lature, &s;ome contended, that a conven|tion brings back the people to the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety; according to which all are equal. That con&s;equently all ought to be equally repre|&s;ented in this convention, for which purpo&s;e eve|ry pari&s;h and county &s;hould be invited to choo&s;e a number of delegates, in exact proportion to its number of free inhabitants. The&s;e principles are undeniable; but the lower country members per|ceived that &s;hould they be adopted, the upper country, by its &s;uperior population, would rule the convention. They, therefore, oppo&s;ed this &s;y&s;tem with all their might, and their &s;uperiority of numbers in the legi&s;lature, en&s;ured their &s;uc|ce&s;s. It was re&s;olved, that each pari&s;h and coun|ty &s;hould &s;end the &s;ame number of delegates to the convention, that it &s;ent of members to the le|gi&s;lature: and thus the lower country pre&s;erved the &s;ame &s;uperiority of numbers, the &s;ame power over the votes, in one a&s;&s;embly, which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the other.</P>
<P>The effects of this plan became vi&s;ible as &s;oon as the convention commenced its deliberations. In every vote the lower country was found to po&s;|&s;e&s;s a deci&s;ive majority. Con&s;equently no reform, however de&s;irable to four fifths of the people, could be made without the lower country's con&s;ent. Some of its members joined the upper country in its attempt to remove the &s;eat of government; which was effected by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But on the &s;ubject of repre&s;entation they were inflexible. An attempt was made to apportion it according to numbers, or to a joint ratio of numbers and
<PB N="29" REF="027092_0034_0FD33A8ED5561CC8">
wealth. The lower country firmly oppo&s;ed both propo&s;itions. A violent conte&s;t en&s;ued, in which, as u&s;ual, the upper country was defeated. The will of four-fifths of the people, expre&s;&s;ed by their repre&s;entatives, was prevented from taking effect, by the oppo&s;ition of one fifth. The num|ber of repre&s;entatives was reduced by one-half, but the proportion remained the &s;ame. To a county, or pari&s;h, which before elected &s;ix repre|&s;entatives, three were allowed. The lower coun|try maintained its former &s;uperiority, and one-fifth of the citizens impo&s;ed a government on the other four-fifths.</P>
<P>This view of the origin of our inequality in re|pre&s;entation, leads us to con&s;ider, next, its pecu|liar nature. This enquiry will make the &s;ubject of the following number.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>APPIUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>No. VI.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the preceeding number, explain|ed the origin of our inequality in repre&s;en|tation, we come now, my fellow-citizens, to con|&s;ider its nature and properties. I fear we &s;hall find them of a very alarming kind.</P>
<P>In North-Carolina and Virginia, &s;ome counties are much larger than others, and yet all choo&s;e an equal number of repre&s;entatives; but there, large and &s;mall counties are equally di&s;tributed through every part of the &s;tate: and if you throw it into two grand divi&s;ions, you cannot &s;ay that one has a greater portion of repre&s;entatives than the other, Thus the repre&s;entation is equal with re&s;pect to the whole &s;tate; though unequal if e&s;timated by &s;ingle counties or di&s;tricts. The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tions will apply to England, where about one twen|tieth
<PB N="30" REF="027092_0035_0FD33A9057115D70">
of the people elects the hou&s;e of commons. But that twentieth is equally di&s;tributed through every part of the kingdom. The mi&s;chief there, is, not that &s;ome parts of the country are une|qually repre&s;ented; but that all are in&s;ufficiently and improperly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>But in this &s;tate the inequality is confined to particular parts of the country, lying contiguous to each other. Not only a pari&s;h containing 300 inhabitants, elects as many repre&s;entatives as a country with 8,000, but a di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch pari&s;hes, and who&s;e aggregate numbers a|mount to only 15,452, elects four times as many repre&s;entatives, as another di&s;trict, who&s;e num|bers are 33,674; and three di&s;tricts on the &s;ea coa&s;t, containing 28,694 white inhabitants, &s;end more repre&s;entatives, than &s;ix other di&s;tricts in the interior country, who&s;e numbers amount to 120,902. Hence it is evident, that one part of the &s;tate, much inferior in extent, and far more &s;o in population, can govern all the other di&s;tricts; which con&s;equently, in&s;tead of being parts of a free government, are reduced to the condition of provinces, &s;ubject to a foreign power.</P>
<P>In the next place, the&s;e different parts of the country differ widely from each other, in &s;ituation and character. In the upper country a great equa|lity of property prevails. Below, &s;ome are very rich, others extremely poor; and from the &s;itua|tion of the country, and mode of cultivation, carried on by &s;laves, and confined, as it is, to &s;ome &s;mall &s;pots of land, this inequality is likely to encrea&s;e with the encrea&s;e of wealth. Inequa|lity of fortune leads to inequality of condition; and inequality of condition is the parent and nur&s;e of ari&s;tocracy. Superior wealth, not only,
<PB N="31" REF="027092_0036_0FD33A91DF058F10">
is apt to beget and cheri&s;h a love of power and privileges, but has a &s;trong tendency to be&s;tow them Hence there is danger that an ari&s;tocrati|cal &s;pirit may ari&s;e in the low country, if it do not already exi&s;t there: and this is a powerful rea&s;on again&s;t &s;uffering that part of the &s;tate to po&s;&s;e&s;s an undue influence in the government. For where ari&s;tocracy once gains admittance, it never cea&s;es to make new encroachments, 'till it has to|tally rooted out the principles of liberty, of which it is the natural and implacable enemy.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the upper and lower counties have oppo&s;ite habits and views in almo&s;t every parti|cular. One is accu&s;tomed to expence, the other to frugality. One will be inclined to numerous offices, large &s;alaries, and an expen&s;ive govern|ment. The other, from the moderate fortunes of the inhabitants, and their &s;imple way of life, will prefer low taxes, &s;mall &s;alaries, and a very fru|gal, civil e&s;tabli&s;hment. One imports almo&s;t every article of con&s;umption, and pays for it in produce: The other is far removed from naviga|tion, has very little to export, and mu&s;t there|fore &s;upply its own wants. Con&s;equently one will favor commerce; the other manufactures. One wi&s;hes for &s;laves; the other will be better without them. Where two cla&s;&s;es of people, in the &s;ame community, have &s;uch oppo&s;ite inclina|tions and cu&s;toms, it is fit that the mo&s;t nume|rous &s;hould govern. For the intere&s;ts and feel|ings of the greate&s;t number ought to be con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>Fourthly, this inequality is much greater in re|ality than appearance From the cen&s;us it ap|pears that 28,000 citizens out of 149,000, govern the whole &s;tate. But we mu&s;t recollect, that in the lower country, where the&s;e 28,000 re&s;ide, the
<PB N="32" REF="027092_0037_0FD33A9421E15AE8">
greate&s;t inequality of property prevails&mdash;This has a tendency to throw all political power and privileges into the hands of the rich; who&s;e num|bers are comparatively &s;mall. The power there|fore which the lower country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by its &s;upe|riority in repre&s;entation, is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all the people of the lower country, but by a &s;mall part of them. A certain great man in Athens, u&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert that his little &s;on governed all Greece: for, &s;aid he, Athens governs Greece, I govern Athens, my wife governs me, and my young &s;on governs my wife. In like manner, a few hun|dred per&s;ons below, govern South Carolina; for they govern the lower country, and the lower country governs the re&s;t of the &s;tate. Of all the properties of our inequality in repre&s;entation, this is the mo&s;t alarming.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, this inequality, already &s;o enormous, is every moment becoming greater. The &s;tate is now governed, we will &s;ay, by one-fifth of its inhabitants, re&s;iding in a particular part of the country. In twenty years, &s;hould the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem remain, it will be governed by one-tenth; in forty years by one-twentieth; and &s;o on as the exce&s;s of numbers becomes greater and greater. The encrea&s;e of population below is very &s;low and incon&s;iderable. The &s;wamps are engro&s;&s;ed by a few families. Be&s;ides, they require immen&s;e labour, and perhaps the labour of Africans to reduce them to cultivation. The high lands are exceedingly barren. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances will continually drive labouring people, of a di&s;po&s;ition, in any degree enterprizing, into the upper country. They will never &s;tay and exhau&s;t their &s;trength in a barren &s;oil, and &s;ickly climate, when they know that lands can ea&s;ily be
<PB N="33" REF="027092_0038_0FD33A9749D4A1D0">
procured in a fertile and healthy country. From the expen&s;ive manner of living below, a family might be independent, and even opulent in the upper country, with what would hardly enable them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t decently near Charle&s;ton. This, with the changes of property, which mu&s;t fre|quently take place, will probably occa&s;ion many families to retire from the lower country with the remains of their fortune, and &s;ettle above. The &s;ickline&s;s of the climate below, which de&s;troys life, perhaps fa&s;ter than it is produced, will pre|vent tho&s;e from multiplying who do not emigrate. It is que&s;tionable, whether Charle&s;ton di&s;trict con|tains, out of Charle&s;ton, more inhabitants now, than it did fifty years ago. The encrea&s;e, if any, has certainly been very incon&s;iderable. A great number of families which were among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, have become wholly extinct; and many, formerly numerous, are now reduced to one or two individuals in each. In the upper country, on the contrary, population advances with an a&s;|toni&s;hing rapidity. A mild and healthy climate, a fertile &s;oil, almo&s;t every where capable of ad|vantageous cultivation&mdash;the &s;imple and active life of the inhabitants, the abundant means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance which moderate labour procures&mdash;the ex|tent of the country, which give the &s;pecies full room to expand it&s;elf; all contribute to multiply it in a manner almo&s;t incredible, and this natural encrea&s;e is aided by con&s;tant migrations, from le&s;s fortunate climes. Thirty years ago, Abbeville and Edgefield counties were &s;o incon&s;iderable as to remain a part of Saint Bartholemews pari&s;h. They now contain 17,280 white inhabitants. The numbers of Pendleton county, which about eight years ago was entirely a de&s;ert, now amount to
<PB N="34" REF="027092_0039_0FD33A9A9E4A12F8">
8731, with this rapid progre&s;s in population, wealth mu&s;t greatly encrea&s;e. A fertile country encrea&s;ing in number of inhabitants, and im|proving in agriculture and arts; where the fruits of his indu&s;try are &s;ecured to every individual, mu&s;t &s;oon become rich. There is no doubt that wealth encrea&s;es much fa&s;ter in the upper country than below. Exports by no means afford a cer|tain criterion of riches. The mo&s;t wealthy coun|tries often export the lea&s;t, becau&s;e the people have enough within them&s;elves, without purcha|&s;ing from abroad, and con&s;ume their own pro|ductions, in&s;tead of exchanging them for tho&s;e of their neighbours. This is very much the ca&s;e with the upper country. On the contrary, al|mo&s;t the whole labour of the lower country, is employed in cultivating &s;taples for exportation. The people import a great part even of their pro|vi&s;ions: and almo&s;t the whole product of their labour is exported. Yet the exports of the upper country have doubled within the la&s;t &s;even or eight years; while tho&s;e from below have encrea|&s;ed very little during that period. Hence it is plain, that the &s;uperiority which the lower coun|try country enjoys in point of wealth, will per|petually dimini&s;h; while its inferiority in num|bers, mu&s;t every day become more con&s;ider|able. Should the pre&s;ent apportionment of repre|&s;entation continue, the time mu&s;t &s;oon arrive, when the upper country, equal to the lower in wealth, and containing ten times as many free inhabitants, will have one third le&s;s power in the government. The lea&s;t opulent, the &s;malle&s;t, and the wor&s;t peopled part of the &s;tate, will rule all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the inequality of our re|pre&s;entation,
<PB N="35" REF="027092_0040_0FD33A9BA7AE0908">
is of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, al|ready enormous, con&s;tantly encrea&s;ing, and throwing the whole power of government into the hands of a &s;mall part of the citizens, who&s;e habits of life, &s;ituation, and political &s;entiments, mu&s;t be for ever different from tho&s;e of the great body of the community. We mu&s;t next con&s;i|der the effects of this inequality.</P>

<P>IT now remains for us my fellow citizens, in this &s;eventh and la&s;t number, to con&s;ider what ef|fects the inequality of which we have been &s;peak|ing, may now, or hereafter, produce on our liber|ties</P>
<P>It is extremely evident, that the &s;ix upper di&s;|tricts are ab&s;olutely under the dominion of the three lower ones, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a deci&s;ive majority in both branches of the legi&s;lature. If any one &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to deny this, let us a&s;k him, whether the whole upper country, &s;hould it unite to a man, can carry any mea&s;ure in the legi&s;lature, however important to its intere&s;ts, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the lower members? Surely it cannot. There hardly can be a que&s;tion which will more deeply intere&s;t the upper country, than the remo|val of the &s;eat of government. But how was it carried; by their own &s;trength? No, all their &s;truggles for that purpo&s;e were ineffectual till they were joined by &s;ome members from below. Though the upper country, to a man, was de&s;i|rous of county courts, though four fifths of the people con&s;idered that e&s;tabli&s;hment as of the ut|mo&s;t importance to their welfare, it was not ob|tained without the greate&s;t difficulty; and never could have taken place, had not &s;ome lower mem|bers
<PB N="36" REF="027092_0041_0FD33A9DD3322B58">
lent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Yet this was a mea&s;ure which the lower country had no intere&s;t to pre|vent. They, therefore, after a long &s;truggle, granted it as a matter of favour. But is it con&s;i&s;|tant with the character of freemen to hold their rights by courte&s;y, at the will of an handful of their fellow citizens? No, this is the condition of &s;ervants, who&s;e ma&s;ters may &s;ometimes be mild, ju&s;t, and even generous; but are ma&s;ters &s;till.</P>
<P>Provinces will be well governed, whenever their intere&s;ts happen to coincide with the views and intere&s;ts of the power to which they are &s;ubject. This power may &s;ometimes even make a &s;mall &s;acrifice of its own intere&s;ts to their wi&s;hes. But will it always be in that di&s;po&s;ition? Let our own hi&s;tory witne&s;s. In &s;ome points where the lower country was not very materially intere&s;ted, it has yielded to the wi&s;hes and intere&s;ts of its &s;ubjects in the upper country. This was the ca&s;e with the county court act. Even the removal of the &s;eat of government, though highly intere&s;ting to tho&s;e lower members, who re&s;ide in Charle&s;ton, and therefore oppo&s;ed by them with all their might, was a matter of indifference to the lower country gentlemen in general, who, when they were for|ced to leave home, cared very little, whether they went to Columbia or Charle&s;ton. Some of them, therefore, gratified the upper country by voting for the removal, and &s;ome, no doubt, voted for it be|cau&s;e they thought it right and conducive to the ge|neral good of the &s;tate. After all, this removal was more properly a divi&s;ion of the government, for all the principal officers continue to re&s;ide in Charle&s;ton. The governor is never obliged to be at Columbia, but while the legi&s;lature is &s;itting. The &s;upreme courts are held there but a few days in the year; the &s;ecretary's, trea&s;urer's, and &s;ur|veyor
<PB N="37" REF="027092_0042_0FD33A9F97094B08">
general's offices, at a great expence, and with much inconvenience to the &s;tate, are divided between Charle&s;ton and Columbia. The lower country was by no means generally intere&s;ted, to prevent this partial removal; and yet through the oppo&s;ition of a few powerful individuals, it did not take place without con&s;iderable difficulty. A complete removal, though much de&s;ired by the whole upper country, by four-fifths of the peo|ple, could not po&s;&s;ibly be obtained. And when a que&s;tion aro&s;e, in which the lower country was univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed in intere&s;t to the upper, the que&s;tion of repre&s;entation, we all know the event. The upper country, with four fifths of the people, and every principle of ju&s;tice and good govern|ment clearly on its &s;ide, was out voted and over ruled. It was not then the intere&s;t of the ruling power to gratify the wi&s;hes, or con&s;ult the inter|e&s;ts of its provinces; and accordingly they were treated with the utmo&s;t neglect, and a &s;y&s;tem of government impo&s;ed upon them, replete with inequality, inju&s;tice and &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>This is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the lower coun|try, which is the governing power, will &s;eldom be di&s;po&s;ed to favor its dependant provinces, the other di&s;tricts, where its own intere&s;ts or conve|nience, or tho&s;e of &s;ome powerful individuals in it, can be in any con&s;iderable degree affected. On how many, and what important points, the&s;e intere&s;ts may differ, will &s;oon appear.</P>
<P>In the election of officers they mu&s;t frequently differ. The lower country will wi&s;h to have go|vernors, &s;enators for congre&s;s, and electors of the pre&s;ident, cho&s;en from among men of their own party and way of thinking. The upper country, on the contrary, will be de&s;irous to fill tho&s;e high and important &s;tations with men whom they know,
<PB N="38" REF="027092_0043_0FD3DFF06EA53920">
and on who&s;e love of true republicani&s;m they can rely. But have they the power of doing it? No. Should the lower country combine in &s;upport of a candidate, the mo&s;t odious to the &s;ix upper di&s;|tricts, that is to four fifths of the citizens, it can give him 90 votes. The upper country has only 73 to oppo&s;e him with. Con&s;equently every pub|lic office of this &s;tate, from the governor and &s;ena|tors of the United States, down to the &s;heriffs of the various di&s;tricts, may be filled, by the lower country in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> with characters the mo&s;t obnoxi|ous to four-fifths of the people.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the upper country &s;hould fix its choice on a candidate univer&s;ally beloved by them, for the office of governor, for in&s;tance, or &s;enator; can they elect him? Not if the lower country thinks proper to &s;upport another. They can give him 73 votes The&s;e 73 votes will repre&s;ent the will of four-fifths of the people. Con&s;equently this candidate will be the choice of four out of five of his fellow citizens. But if the other one-fifth think proper to oppo&s;e him, they can give his antagoni&s;t 90 votes, and prevent his election.</P>
<P>It is not only in elections, but in pa&s;&s;ing laws, laying taxes, and indeed in every legi&s;lative act, that this tyranny may be exerci&s;ed. The cultiva|ted lands in the lower country are of ten or twen|ty times the productive value of tho&s;e above. At pre&s;ent they are taxed according to their re&s;pective value, which is ju&s;t: but &s;uppo&s;e the lower coun|try &s;hould think fit to alter the mode, and to tax all lands equally: could the upper country pre|vent it? No. Suppo&s;e the people below &s;hould choo&s;e to take off the tax on negroes, and lay it upon cattle, tobacco, hemp, and wheat; &s;o as to remove the whole burden of public contribution from their own &s;houlders, and lay it on tho&s;e of
<PB N="39" REF="027092_0044_0FD33AA378855470">
the upper country: could the latter prevent this unju&s;t impo&s;ition? No. The lower country has a decided majority in the legi&s;lature, and can make what laws, and lay what taxes, it may think pro|per. Suppo&s;e it &s;hould think proper to lay a poll tax; by which a man in the lower country po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of 10,000 pounds would pay no more for the &s;upport of government, than one in Ninety-&s;ix or Pinckney, who has only ten pounds: it has the power of doing it. It may al&s;o take off the tax on coaches and lay it on waggons: if it &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o, the upper country has no power to hinder it.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enumerate all the in&s;tan|ces, in which the lower country, by its &s;uperiority in repre&s;entation, may &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of four-fifths of the people who are governed, to the intere&s;ts or convenience of one-fifth which governs.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, will all the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions be exerci&s;ed? I do not &s;ay that all of them will; per|haps it may be a con&s;iderable time before we &s;hall feel any of them. I contend that they may be exerci&s;ed, that the lower country has the power of exerci&s;ing them: a power which it has in ma|ny in&s;tances exerted: and I &s;ay that it is incon&s;i&s;t|ant with every ju&s;t idea of freedom for the great body of the people to be in the power of a &s;mall part, and to hold its rights dependant on their ju&s;|tice or favor. Why did we quarrel with Great Britain? Not for the evils which &s;he inflicted up|on us, but to guard again&s;t tho&s;e which &s;he might inflict. Not becau&s;e &s;he taxed us in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever, without our con&s;ent; but becau&s;e &s;he claimed a right of doing &s;o. This right the lower country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over the upper, and may exerci&s;e whenever prompted to do &s;o by its intere&s;ts or inclination.</P>
<P>And now my fellow citizens, I conclude with a
<PB N="40" REF="027092_0045_0FD33AA732C1BA88">
warning which requires your mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion. Beware of &s;uppo&s;ing, that becau&s;e the evil which I have pointed out, does not at pre&s;ent pre&s;s with its whole weight upon you, it is therefore unworthy of immediate attention. Great abu&s;es in government, like great rivers, ari&s;e from &s;mall beginings. They are ea&s;ily checked at fir&s;t, but encrea&s;ing imperceptibly in their progre&s;s, they at length become too powerful for oppo&s;ition. Thus corruption crept into the Briti&s;h government; and thus your liberties will be gradually undermi|ned, unle&s;s you &s;peedily apply a remedy to the dangerous malady under which our con&s;titution labours.</P>
