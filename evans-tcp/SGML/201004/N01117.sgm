<HEAD>A MEMORIAL Of the Pre&s;ent Deplorable STATE of New-England.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>New-England</HI> had for many Years before the Late Happy <HI>Revolution,</HI> Enjoy'd the Liberty and Property of as Free and Ea&s;y a <HI>Charter</HI> as a People could De&s;ire; and this too, with as much Satisfaction and Loyalty on their part, as Malice and Envy on that of their Ene|mies; who, from a Per&s;ecuting Spirit, looking upon this their <HI>Charter</HI> with an evil Eye, took up an Implacable Re&s;olution of Robbing them of it. They had no &s;ooner Effected this, but a va&s;t Scene of Mi&s;ery appear'd; and they found among the Principal In&s;truments of this Mi&s;chief, <HI>One,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The pre&s;ent Gover|nour, J. Dodley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is a Native of New En|gland, Born at or near a place call'd Roxbury, 2 Miles from Bo&s;ton.</NOTE> <HI>whom their own Womb had brought forth, and who&s;e Brea&s;ts had Nouri&s;h'd!</HI> But the Unhappy (or rather Hap|py) Reign of the Late K. <HI>J.</HI> running Precipi|tantly upon its own Ruin, made well for the Deliverance of <HI>New-England;</HI> without which, doubtle&s;s the People had fell a Sacrifice to <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h Slavery:</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001331_0007_0FB27CAC11C15190">We &s;hall not Recriminate here the Mi&s;managements of the then Governour Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s,</HI> &s;ince that Gentleman is now in a Future State; but by the way, we think it highly Nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;ome Matters of Fact, of the pre&s;ent Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> who, (un|der the &s;aid Sir <HI>E. Andro&s;s</HI>) acted as Pre&s;ident of the Council, and One of the <HI>Quorum</HI> in all his Affairs.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of this Man, &s;o &s;oon as he arriv'd, &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the fir&s;t Opportunity to di&s;cover him of a Mercenary Intere&s;t. In|deed, the People were &s;omething Surpris'd to &s;ee the publick Offices and Places of Tru&s;t &s;natch'd from them, and Conferr'd on Strangers on one hand, and the Avarice and Beggary of a Crew of Mercenary Fellows, Supported by Extortion on t'other. But, when the Pre&s;i|dent was plea&s;ed, out of an Active and Pa&s;&s;ive Principle, to tell our Countreymen, in open Council, <HI>That the People in</HI> New-En|gland <HI>were all Slaves; and that the</HI> only <HI>Difference between Them and Slaves, was their not being</HI> Bought <HI>and</HI> Sold: <HI>And that they mu&s;t not think the Priviledges of</HI> Engli&s;hmen <HI>would follow them to the end of the World.</HI> I &s;ay, when the People heard this, they lookt upon them&s;elves in a manner Lo&s;t. On one Hand they &s;aw their Enemies inve&s;ted with a full Power in the Government; on t'other they &s;aw them&s;elves not only turn'd out of the Publick Mini&s;try, but under a Nece&s;&s;itous Fear of being Quiet, le&s;t their E&s;tates &s;hould be Siezed, and them&s;elves Impri&s;oned. On this &s;ide they &s;aw their Wives and Children, their Fathers, Mothers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Butchered daily by a Handful of Barbarous Indians; on t'other &s;ide, little or no Re&s;i&s;tance made by their Armies, which were Commanded by tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion; in&s;omuch that it &s;eem'd rather an intended Ma&s;&s;acre, than a De&s;ire of putting an End to a Diabolick and Bloody War. They &s;aw then, that they had to their Co&s;t, brought forth a <HI>Prophet,</HI> who told them they were Slaves; and they then &s;aw his Prophecy fulfilling; In fine, they &s;aw all this, but per|ceiv'd no way to E&s;cape; till throwing up their Cryes to Heaven, they were animated by Divine Power, to Re&s;cue them&s;elves and Children from the approaching Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001331_0008_0FB27CAEDA27ADC0">Under the Pre&s;&s;ure of all the&s;e Grievances, they Unanimou&s;ly aro&s;e, upon the coming in of the late King <HI>William,</HI> of Ble&s;&s;ed Me|mory, Siezed the Government for His Maje&s;ty's U&s;e; and, among&s;t the re&s;t of the Authors of their Mi&s;eries, not unju&s;tly Impri&s;on'd this their pre&s;ent Governour.</P>
<P>From that time <HI>New-England</HI> took Heart, and concluded that Heaven was removing from them all the Plagues in their Land. They indeed Thankfully Rejoyced to &s;ee them&s;elves Re&s;tored to their Ancient Liberty, as afterwards in a great Mea&s;ure they were by another Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And thus much for the former Actions of the Author of the following Matters of Fact, which has rendred His Love to his Na|tive Country, His Veneration for the Liberty and Property of a Free People, His Fidelity, Ju&s;tice, and Loyalty, in delivering the Oppre&s;&s;ed, and detecting the Queen's profe&s;s'd Enemies, but the Rever&s;e of Good Mens Actions, and ought to be Remembred only as &s;o many Monuments of Infamy.</P>
<P>But to come down to our Memorial, and inform the World of the modern Mi&s;managements of this unhappy Gentleman, we hum|bly Declare, That</P>
<P>THE Trade with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> being &s;o countenanced by the Governour, that without &s;peedy Remedy, the Coun|try is in great Danger of being Ruined, which will plainly Ap|pear as follows:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In the Year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">5. The Governour &s;ent his Son, <HI>William Dudley</HI> with Captain <HI>Vetch,</HI> to <HI>Canada,</HI> under a pretence of Redee|ming Captives; but brought very few back to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> of tho&s;e that were there, and them of the Meane&s;t &s;ort, leaving the Principal of the &s;aid Captives behind, to give them occa&s;ion of going again, that they might have a Pretence to Colour their Treacherous De|&s;ign of Trading, as Appears by the &s;aid <HI>Vetch</HI>'s Acknowledgment, of going to Settle a Corre&s;pondency with the Enemy, and carrying a Cargo out with him of 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which, according to their Di&s;po&s;al,
<PB N="4" REF="001331_0009_0FB27CAFC90A7FB8">
might amount to near 3000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as particularly Shot, which was Sold at 13 <HI>Sous per</HI> Pound; whereof they carried a con&s;iderable Quantity, al&s;o Rigging, Pitch, Iron, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, fit for &s;upplying the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> and this done under a Colour, of the &s;aid <HI>Vetch</HI>'s going to get in a Debt due to him, from the <HI>French,</HI> of 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> with the Governour's Approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For Settling a Corre&s;pondency with the <HI>French</HI> Gover|nour at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> for Exchange of Pri&s;oners; Whereas, it was indeed, only a Cover for an Illegal Trade; when, at the &s;ame time, the <HI>French</HI> there, were drove to &s;uch extream Hard&s;hips, for want of Ammunition, Provi&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that mo&s;t of their Principal People were forced to go out a Privateering on our Coa&s;ts, who were afterwards taken and brought into <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> particularly one <HI>Battis,</HI> a Man of great Note and Service among the Enemy, who had been a Barbarous, Murdering Fellow, to the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> He, with all the other <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners, were &s;ent to <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and Di&s;charged; but great part of our People that were Pri&s;oners, were left behind at the &s;ame time, and that, becau&s;e our Governour had been fal&s;e in his Promi&s;e, to the <HI>French</HI> Governour, who had re&s;trained the <HI>Indians</HI> from di&s;turbing our Fi&s;hery, and indeed would not allow them any Ammunition for a con&s;iderable time, till our Governour taking that Opportunity of the <HI>Indians,</HI> great Want countenanced a Trade with them, and &s;upply'd them by the Ve&s;&s;els that were &s;ent as Tran&s;ports (as afore&s;aid) to fetch Pri&s;oners; when at the &s;ame time they were made Ve&s;&s;els of Mer|chandize, as appears by the <HI>Indian</HI> Traders on their Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Country are at a va&s;t Charge, in maintaining an Army Yearly, to March &s;everal Hundred Miles up into the Coun|try, to De&s;troy the <HI>Indians</HI> Corn, the better to di&s;inable them to Sub&s;i&s;t; for they have been &s;o Reduced (as by Information of the Captives) that a great part of them would Peri&s;h for Want, were it not for the Supply they had from the &s;aid <HI>Indian</HI> Traders; who par|ticularly, Sold about Eight Quarts of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn for one large <HI>Beaver</HI> Skin; which Trade has been all along countenanced by the Gover|nour, which &s;ufficiently Appears, by his being always Unwilling
<PB N="5" REF="001331_0010_0FB27CB5D93BAFB0">
the Pri&s;oners taken in that Trade &s;hould be Fined, or Puni&s;hed, even owned by <HI>Vetch,</HI> as in his Petition more at large, is &s;et forth.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Country was at a great Expence, in Erecting a For|tification at <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> and maintaining a number of Soldiers for &s;ecuring the &s;ame, thereby to &s;uppre&s;s the Enemy, and keep &s;ure Footting in that part of the Country; and the Governour, through &s;ome De&s;ign or Neglect, did &s;uffer tho&s;e Soldiers to remain there without any Commi&s;&s;ion Officer, to the great Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Dread to the Soldiers; in&s;omuch, that they Declared to Captain <HI>Cally,</HI> (a Member of the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) that when the Enemy came upon them, they would Surrender the Fort, and dare not Re&s;i&s;t for want of a Commi&s;&s;ion. Then Captain <HI>Cally</HI> made Ap|plication to the A&s;&s;embly, which he found Sitting when he came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and they repre&s;ented to the Governour, that &s;peedy care might be taken, that &s;ome Per&s;on might be Commi&s;&s;ionated to Command that Fort, which, with a great deal of Difficulty, was at la&s;t Obtained.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> And further, as to the Governour's countenancing this Private and Illegal Trade, the Country has been at va&s;t Expence, occa&s;ioned thereby; in&s;omuch, that at one Se&s;&s;ions the la&s;t Summer, the A&s;&s;embly were forc'd to rai&s;e 33000 Pounds, for Supporting and Maintaining the Charge they were put to, by the Enemies In|va&s;ions, after they had a Supply; that whereas, if things were rightly Managed, and the Enemy kept back for want of tho&s;e Supplies, one Third Part of the &s;aid Sum might have an&s;wer'd the End. The <HI>Indians</HI> that were Supply'd by tho&s;e Traders, are the on|ly People that De&s;troyed our <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts, the Fi&s;hery, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Accady;</HI> and al&s;o the very &s;ame that were at De&s;troying of <HI>New-found land;</HI> particularly one <HI>E&s;combu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> a Principal Comman|der among them, who is generally one that Heads the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they come to De&s;troy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> The Governour, with his Son <HI>Paul,</HI> not being Content with what Money they come fairly by, and over greedy of Gain, are very Screwing and Exacting upon the People, particularly up|on &s;undry Inhabitants, taking away their Priviledge in catching
<PB N="6" REF="001331_0011_0FB27CB821168138">
of Whales, a Priviledge they have Enjoyed many Years before; that is, (under Pretence of Drift Fi&s;h) what Whales are taken by Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, he takes from them by Force, not giving them the Liberty of a Tryal at <HI>Common-Law,</HI> but for his own Ends, decides the Matter in the Admiralty, where his Son <HI>Paul</HI> is the Queen's Attourny and Advocate, thereby Encroaching the whole to them|&s;elves, a thing never heard of before, and very much to the Preju|dice of Her Maje&s;ty's good Subjects there, and that without Re|medy.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> As to the Addre&s;s the Governour Obtained, pretended to come over from the General A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in his favour, for his Continuance, it was no more than what he Clande&s;tinely pro|cured, by &s;ending to his particular Friends; &s;uch, who being ei|ther Related to him, or bore Commi&s;&s;ions under him, dare not deny his Reque&s;t, and was never approved nor allowed of by the A&s;&s;em|bly; but on the Contrary, had not the Majority of the Country, waited in Expectation of Her Maje&s;ty's Favour, in &s;ending another Governour, they would largely have &s;ignified their Re&s;entments and Di&s;&s;atisfaction, in the Admini&s;tration of <HI>Dudly</HI>'s Government.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> While the Great and General A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> were Sitting, there arrived a Flagg of Truce from <HI>Canada,</HI> with a haugh|ty Demand of the Governour, for all the <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners, charg|ing of him with breach of Promi&s;e, which was the occa&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> Governour's not &s;ending &s;everal of the Pri&s;oners, particularly a Mini&s;ter that was taken Captive at <HI>Derefield,</HI> detained by the <HI>French,</HI> who might have been Di&s;charged with &s;undry others.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> The Lower Hou&s;e, mi&s;tru&s;ting the <HI>French</HI> Flagg of Truce coming upon a Trading De&s;ign, as well as for Pri&s;oners, ordered the Flagg of Truce to be diligently Searched, who found on Board their Ve&s;&s;el &s;undry new Arms and Ammunition, hid in Private Places, particularly new Bullets, hid among Pea&s;e, and yet denied by the Commander, who was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renagado, which Ammunition being brought before the A&s;&s;embly, were generally concluded to be Bought in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> whereupon, the Governour in|terpo&s;ing
<PB N="7" REF="001331_0012_0FB27CBB10385030">
the Matter was hu&s;hed up and Conniv'd at, to the great Di&s;&s;atisfaction of the A&s;&s;embly, and Country in general.</P>
<P>This being realy the State of <HI>New-England,</HI> and its Pro|vinces, it may very well be called Deplorable, when it is render'd the very Scene of Arbitrary Power, with all that's Mi&s;erable: But to proceed, before I come down to the &s;e|veral Affidavits upon the&s;e Heads, it is Convenient to Recite &s;ome Letters from the Inhabitants of that Place, who, under a deep Sen&s;e of their Approaching Ruin, have breath'd forth their Complaints in the following Words.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INa&s;much, as you have Expected from me, a true and brief Repre|&s;entation of &s;everal Matters, relating to this Province, I &s;hall, with all po&s;&s;ible Faithfulne&s;s, endeavour it. Our pre&s;ent Governour is not without a number of tho&s;e, whom he has by Promotions and Flatteries made his Friends; but this hinders not a much more con|&s;iderable number, from wi&s;hing, that we had a Governour, who would put an end unto the horrid Reign of Bribery, in our Admini&s;tration, and who would not infinitely Incommode Her Maje&s;ty's Service, by keeping the People in continual Jealou&s;ies of his Plots, upon their mo&s;t Valuable Interests.</P>
<P>What the di&s;po&s;ition of the People towards him is, you may gue&s;s by this: There was lately prepared an Addre&s;s from hence, to the <HI>Queen,</HI> upon many important Articles; but by certain Arts there was got into it a Clau&s;e, to de&s;ire of the <HI>Queen,</HI> that this Govern|our might be continued, the Repre&s;entatives Voted all the re&s;t of the Addre&s;s, but this Clau&s;e they ab&s;olutely Rejected; they could not get above Five or Six Votes for it, &s;o the whole Addre&s;s, (which was contrived by a Party for nothing but that Clau&s;e) fell to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001331_0013_0FB27CBC9C8DC8B0">There happened lately a number of Per&s;ons, namely, <HI>Boreland Vetch, Rou&s;e, Law&s;on, Philips</HI> and <HI>Cauplin</HI> to be taken manag|ing an unlawful Trade with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> the Commodi|ties wherein they Traded, were &s;uch, that the late Act of Parliament made their Crime to be <HI>High-Trea&s;on,</HI> and we had no <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI> relating to that Matter, but was defectively Expre&s;&s;ed: Our merciful A&s;&s;embly was mighty loathe to proceed unto &s;o &s;evere a Judgment as that of Death, upon the&s;e Offenders. The Offenders Pe|titioning for it, the General A&s;&s;embly were (very much by the Go|vernours influence) drawn into it, to take the Tryal of them into their own Hands; and as only Guilty of an High Mi&s;demeanour, the Vote for it was obtained in a Thin Hou&s;e, upon an hurry at breaking up; and &s;ome Clau&s;es in the Charter were &s;o Con&s;trued, as to Counte|nance it. &V;pon their coming together again, they would fain have revoked their Votes, as fearing, that the very Per&s;ons who had been their Tempters into it, would turn their Accu&s;ers, and improve it by way of Complaint, for the Enemies of our Charter to work upon; but the Governour would by no means permit the Revocation of that wrong Step, (if it were one) &s;o the Tryal proceeded, and the Offenders were Fined in &s;everal Sums, by an <HI>Act</HI> of the Governour and A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>It is now &s;aid, that the ingrateful Men who were &s;aved from the Gallows, by the Tenderne&s;s of the Government, are now cutting our Throats, and Petition home against the Government, for Fining them in&s;tead of Hanging them; yea, it is al&s;o &s;aid, that the very Per&s;on who was the chief Cau&s;e of drawing the A&s;&s;embly into this ex|traordinary Proceeding, intends to make an ill u&s;e of it, against the Country; if you are &s;en&s;ible of any thing of this nature carrying on, we pray you to add unto the re&s;t of your Offices, that of an In|terce&s;&s;ion, that an harmle&s;s People, &s;urpriz'd into any Error, may not be Puni&s;hed any otherwi&s;e, than by the removal of &s;uch as have been the Cau&s;es of it; and &s;o much for that.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001331_0014_0FB27CC244827EC8"><HI>Sir,</HI> You would do a vast Service to the Crown, if you would &s;et forward the de&s;igns of reducing <HI>Canada,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> a much le&s;s Fleet than what annually goes into the <HI>Indies,</HI> coming early enough in the Spring, may ea&s;ily do the former, even in the way thither; and a <HI>Scotch Colony</HI> might be of good Con&s;equence to do the latter; but if any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould be ex|pected in this matter, it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that the Country have a Governour whom the People may &s;omewhat Rely upon.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> You are Born to do the <HI>Queen</HI> and the Nation Service; you are &s;pirited for great undertakings; you are highly beloved and e&s;tee|med among our People in this Land, and where-ever you have come, 'tis wi&s;hed that you may do &s;ome con&s;iderable Action in this Affair.</P>
<P>I have been earne&s;tly Sollicited to Addre&s;s one of the most Illu&s;trious Patriots of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, my Lord High Trea&s;urer, with &s;ome of the&s;e Intimations: That Noble Per&s;on is known to be &s;uch a Patron to all good Men, and &s;uch a defence of Oppre&s;&s;ed Innocence and Liberties, that we all fly to him as our unque&s;tionable Refuge. I am well &s;atisfied there would need nothing (to &s;peak Humanely) to make this Country Ea&s;y and Happy, but for that excellent <HI>Per&s;on</HI> to have an exact Repre&s;entation of our Circum&s;tances; nothing hinders me from attempting it, but the hazard of doing what may be thought a pre&s;umption in one &s;o much a &s;tranger to him, neverthele&s;s, I am de&s;ired by &s;ome con&s;iderable <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to move you, that you would wait upon his Lord&s;hip, and fully acquaint him with the Matters now laid before you,</P>

the extream Di&s;tre&s;s whereto the <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion had brought St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> and <HI>Nevis,</HI> the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> in a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian manner expre&s;&s;ed their Charity towards tho&s;e, who perhaps would have hardly done the like for them, on a like Occa&s;ion. We made a Collection for the Relief of their Nece&s;&s;ities, the Collection was, as I am told, between 7 and 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in this Collection, there were two Churches in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the <HI>South</HI> and the <HI>North,</HI> one gave &s;omewhat above a 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the other gave a little under it.

<P>The foregoing Letter carrying with it &s;o many undeniable Truths, the World mu&s;t of con&s;equence concede with the gene|ral Exclamations of the now Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>New-Englanders.</HI> Indeed the Publick had not been allarm'd with the&s;e Di&s;tant Calamities, had the inexorable Authors of them adhered to reitterated Grie|vances, from tho&s;e who too &s;everely &s;uffer'd under their Pro|tection. The Author of this Letter, who is a Per&s;on of a Cha|racter beyond the reach of Envy, and one who is a great Ble&s;&s;ing to his Native Country, had not invoked the Protection and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of others, without a due &s;en&s;e of the Danger his innocent Neighbours and Country-men were expos'd to. To Report all the Letters of Complaint from the&s;e Provinces, would be too Voluminous and tire&s;ome to the Reader; we will only mention one more, which, tho' &s;hort and plain, carries nothing but Ve|racity with it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the foregoing Letters we find &s;everal things Worthy our Remark; but I &s;hall only mention the Three following:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>That without Money, there is no Ju&s;tice to be had in</HI> New-England; So that the meaner &s;ort, doubtle&s;s, is in a Deplorable Condition; the faces of their Poor being ground to Du&s;t; their Widows Hou&s;es laid Wa&s;te, and the hopes of their Offspring cut off. From whence we may infer, that <HI>New-England</HI> having a Go|vernour, who&s;e God is the Mammon of this World; who&s;e Prin|ciples act Counter to the De&s;ign of his Power; and who&s;e Drift is the Ruin of his own Country; the Inhabitants thereof have nothing but Ju&s;tice on their part to Petition Her Maje&s;ty to throw him a&s;ide.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>A general unea&s;ine&s;s under, and oppo&s;ition to this Governour, thro' the whole Country.</HI> And this, methinks, might &s;top the Mouths of &s;ome People here, (who, not knowing the Nature of this affair, no otherwi&s;e than as their Intere&s;t leads them to &s;ide with the Governour, or by Virtue of a bare Friend&s;hip Contracted with him whil&s;t he Re&s;ided in <HI>England</HI>) and put a Period to all their Objections in his Behalf; e&s;pecially One, unhappily let &s;lip from the Mouth of a Gentleman too well known for his great Lear|ning and Parts, to be thought &s;o over-&s;ighted, and that is to this Effect. <HI>If a Governour must be removed for every trivial Complaint, there wou'd be no End of &s;uch Removals; and Her Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;try would be wholly taken up with turning out, and putting in.</HI> I will not pretend to affirm the Rea&s;on that produc'd this ha&s;ty Plea for our Criminal Governour; but &s;ure I am, the Author of it knows too much Law, than to extenuate the like Crimes in others. And a weak Argument I take it to indeavour the influencing our Su|periors in Redre&s;&s;ing Grievances of the Subject, when the &s;everal matters of Fact Sworn to, are laid down before them: But,
<PB N="12" REF="001331_0017_0FB27CCCD7F0AD68">
to &s;ay no more, this Gentleman has not been the fir&s;t that has over-&s;hot him&s;elf in Defending things of this Nature. And,</P>
<P N="3">(3dly,) <HI>A fervent De&s;ire to be eas'd of Oppre&s;&s;ion, i: e.</HI> That they might be capable of acknowledging with Re&s;pect and Gratitude, the mighty advantages of &s;uch a Deliverance to the <HI>Queen</HI> of Great Brittain; to a <HI>Queen</HI> who is all Ju&s;tice and Piety, Peace and Union; and a Queen who will not only hear the Petitions of her Subjects, but maintain them in their Rights and Priviledges. Let not <HI>New-England</HI> doubt then of finding Redre&s;s, from &s;o Great and Gra|cious a Mi&s;tre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubtle De&s;igns and Eva&s;ions of Evil-minded Men. And &s;o we come to pre&s;ent the Reader with a further Account of the &s;aid Mi&s;managements, by another Hand.</P>
<P>SOmetime in the Spring of the Year, 1706. Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> the pre|&s;ent Governour of the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay,</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> writ a Letter from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Directed to Mr. <HI>Richard Waldron,</HI> and my &s;elf, to u&s;e our Intere&s;t to prevail with the Coun|cil at an A&s;&s;embly, to Draw up an Addre&s;s to the <HI>Queen,</HI> That Her Maje&s;ty would plea&s;e to continue the &s;aid <HI>Dudley</HI> in the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire:</HI> Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Wal|dron</HI> (after he had Communicated the Letter to me) drew up an Addre&s;s, and &s;hew'd it to the A&s;&s;embly, and prevailed with them to pa&s;s it in Both Hou&s;es, with little Alteration. And this is the Addre&s;s that is now come over from the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly was much again&s;t it, but we thought it would be be&s;t for us to do any thing that would plea&s;e the Governour at that time; con&s;idering, that we were always in danger of the Enemy, and concluded, it was much in his Power, under God, to pre&s;erve us, having often heard him &s;ay, that he would &s;top the Courier of the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> (when he pleas'd) in a Month or Six Weeks time; and I did then, and do &s;till be|lieve, that he could prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> from coming upon us, and Killing us as they did; for I know that he had Corre&s;pondence with a <HI>Fryer</HI> or <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> or one &s;o called, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> that Lives among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and hath great influence over them, who Writes him&s;elf <HI>Galen Eme&s;ary.</HI> The Governour, to my certain Knowledge, did order &s;undry things that were &s;ent him;
<PB N="13" REF="001331_0018_0FB27CCDCA8275D0">
and, con&s;idering the great Corre&s;pondence (he told me) he had with the Governour of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> it cau&s;ed a firm belief in me, that he could do what he would with the Enemy: The&s;e, with other Motives, pre&s;s'd us forwards to get the Addre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed, concluding all the&s;e things would add to our Peace, if rightly improved; and the <HI>Indians,</HI> about that time, and for many Months before, had done little or no Mi&s;chief, and for my part, I did really be|lieve, that it was the Governour's Intere&s;t that cau&s;ed our quiet, but &s;oon found we were Mi&s;taken, finding out, that much about the &s;ame time that <HI>Waldren</HI> and my &s;elf were forwarding the Ad|dre&s;s to Her Maje&s;ty, to continue Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> Governour, he was countenancing a private Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> our Enemies, as we found by woful Experience: For &s;oon after tho&s;e Traders went to the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> came &s;harply down upon us about the latter end of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, Killed Six People, Wounded two, and carried away two from the Town of <HI>Almsbury,</HI> and a little before they Killed Lieutenant <HI>John Shapleigh,</HI> at the Town of <HI>Kittery,</HI> and a whole Family, as a Man, Wife and Children, all Killed and Scalped out of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Dover;</HI> and one Man Killed with Swan-&s;hot out of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Hampton;</HI> and Nine Killed, one Wounded, and one carried out of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Exeter.</HI> All the&s;e Barbarities were committed before I came from thence, which was about the beginning of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t; God knows how many have been thus Barbarou&s;ly Murther'd &s;ince. Captain <HI>Vetch,</HI> and Captain <HI>Law&s;on,</HI> oftentimes told me, that they had oftentimes acquainted the Governour with their de|&s;ign of going to the <HI>Eastward</HI> upon Trade, and had the con&s;ent of him, and did &s;olemnly prote&s;t they would not have gone without it: And I do believe, and it is generally believed in <HI>New-England,</HI> that the Governour did know of this Trade, and no doubt but he was to have a &s;hare of the Profit. When the&s;e Tra|ders came from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> one of their Ve&s;&s;els &s;top|ped at the I&s;le of <HI>Shoals,</HI> near the Province of New <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> the Ma&s;ter's Name was <HI>Rou&s;e,</HI> who brought to that place from <HI>Port Royal</HI> Seven Pri&s;oners; and Capt. <HI>Jethro Furbur</HI> being at the &s;aid I&s;les of <HI>Shoales,</HI> at the &s;aid time when the <HI>Ve&s;&s;el</HI> came in, heard the &s;aid Pri|&s;oners affirm, That the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Indians had no Shot, nor Bullets, nor Lead to make any, and it was very &s;carce with the <HI>French,</HI> in|&s;omuch that they could not &s;upply them, &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI> were
<PB N="16" REF="001331_0019_0FB27CD1FA3B5558">
like to Starve for want of Ammunition; for great part of their Livelihood depends on their Guns to Kill wild Bea&s;ts and Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby we find it was not the Governour's Intere&s;t he had with the Enemy, to prevent their coming upon us, but it was for want of Ammunition: And tho&s;e Pri&s;oners that were brought from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which Capt. <HI>Furber</HI> &s;poke with at the I&s;les of <HI>Shoals,</HI> did fur|ther affirm, That they heard the Governour of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> &s;ay, That he had given his Letter to the Governour of <HI>Boston,</HI> that he would not &s;upply the Indians with Powder nor Shot, but that he would do all he could to prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> coming upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and had been as good as his Word; but that the &s;aid Governour of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> or his People, had &s;upplied the <HI>Indians</HI> with more Ammunition than he was able to do; for the Traders from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> brought it by Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">; and that if this Trade had not been incouraged by the Governour, we &s;hould have had no Men Killed, nor indeed any Di&s;turbance among&s;t us. It is my Belief, and it &s;eems very plain to me, that the Governour intends to forward the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy to De|&s;troy all they can, and keep the Country allarm'd, thereby to put them to &s;uch va&s;t Charges, as will Ruin the whole Government, by Killing &s;ome and Impoveri&s;hing the re&s;t. There was never &s;uch Taxes on the Poor People as now; 33000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> being rai&s;ed a little be|fore I came away, and many great Sums not long before that. I was credibly Informed that &s;ome Per&s;ons were forced to cut open their Beds, and Sell the Feathers to Pay their Taxes. I do'nt remember that ever there was any of the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy Kill'd or Taken &s;ince Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> came over Governour, except an Old Woman, and two others I took to be Girls by their Scalps; and &s;ome few taken near <HI>Port Royal</HI> taken by Major <HI>Church.</HI> So that in&s;tead of being De|&s;troyed, I wi&s;h they be not pre&s;erv'd: For, Six Months before it came to pa&s;s, the Governour Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> told me, what Methods the <HI>Indians</HI> would take when they came again, and it proved accordingly. He told me, That the <HI>Indians</HI> would not come in any great Body as they u&s;ed to do, but they would come in &s;mall Numbers, no Number above Thirty, and &s;o Line the Woods from <HI>Dearfield,</HI> which is the South-We&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Government, and all along the Woods, ju&s;t without the Towns to <HI>Casko</HI> Bay, which is the North-Ea&s;t Part of Inhabitants at this time. And this Method I am afraid will be continued till the Country is for a great part De&s;troyed, if Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> be continued Governour. As for the Addre&s;s he ob|tained
<PB N="15" REF="001331_0020_0FB27CD646052B10">
of the Militia of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI>'s Bay, it was a forc'd thing; for the Officers are beholden to him for their Commi&s;&s;ions, and if any Refus'd to Sign what the Governour got drawn, he could put them out, and put in others as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus having given the Publick an Exact Relation of the pre&s;ent State of <HI>New-England,</HI> it remains only that we Produce a Confir|mation of all that hath been &s;aid. To which end we will begin with the &s;everal Affidavits and Depo&s;itions already made, and which are as follows.</P>

The <HI>Athenians,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Liberty they gave to &s;ome of their Rulers, yet they appointed a Reckoning Day among them; &s;o that tho&s;e that thought them&s;elves not accountable whil&s;t in Authority, found at la&s;t a very &s;trict Account to be given to certain Auditors, and a wor&s;er Puni&s;h|ment inflicted on them if Criminal, than the abu&s;ed Clemency of this Age can produce: To do Ju&s;tice and Right is the mo&s;t in|valuable Jewel in <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and a Ble&s;&s;ing which no People in the World can boa&s;t of, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Nation. The <HI>New-Englanders</HI> are of the &s;ame Tribe; have the &s;ame Liberty to, and the &s;ame Property in the Enjoyment of the many Legal Priviledges in that Charter contained: They are <HI>not Slaves,</HI> as their conceited Governour once told them; but have &s;till a right Le|gally to oppo&s;e his Pride and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; have &s;till a Right to Petition for a Better, that will not be Brib'd to do Evil; they have a Right to tell the World, and that loudly, That for a Gover|nour to furni&s;h the Enemy with Powder and Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to de&s;troy his own Country-men, is a Wretch not only fit to be Di&s;carded, but to be for ever forgotten among Mankind.</P>
<P>The Cryes &s;ent up to Heaven, by the many poor Souls lately mo&s;t inhumanely Butchered by the Mercile&s;s <HI>Indians,</HI> with our own In&s;truments, have reached the Ears of the Almighty, and will certainly draw down Redre&s;s from him, who is not only <HI>Rex Magnus &amp; Rex Solus,</HI> but <HI>Judex Supremus,</HI> who hath <HI>Im|perium fine fine,</HI> as well as <HI>fine Limite,</HI> to whom we commit all that hath been already &s;aid.</P>
<P>And now to Conclude all, (that our Readers may have a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the unaccountable Cruelties acted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> upon our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) we &s;hall pre&s;ent them with the following Particulars, lately &s;ent over to us by a very great and good Man.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of &s;everal Barbarities lately committed by the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> Intermix'd with &s;ome Memorable Providences.</HEAD>
<P>AStoni&s;hing Deliverances have been &s;ent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the Point of De&s;truction; but, <HI>The&s;e poor ones have Cryed unto the Lord,</HI> and He has Remarkably delivered them.</P>
<P>'Tis a Wonderful Re&s;traint from God upon the Bruiti&s;h Sal|vages, that no <HI>Engli&s;h Woman</HI> was ever known to have any Violence offered unto her <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> by any of them.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the Captives have been Murde|red by them, neither when they were Drunk, nor when the Capri|chio's, and the Cruelties of their Diabolical Natures were to be Gratified.</P>
<P>'Tis Wonderful, that when many of the Captives have been ju&s;t going to be Sacrificed, &s;ome &s;trange Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Providence has put a &s;top to the Execution, and prevent|ed their being made a Sacrifice. The Stories are numberle&s;s. Take a few of them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="001331_0037_0FB27D0A13AEC1E0">A C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">e of Indians had been three Days without any manner of Su&s;tenance. They took an Engli&s;h Child, and hung it before the Fire to Roa&s;t it for their Supper; but that the&s;e Canibals might Satiate their&mdash; I want a Name for it,&mdash;as well as their Hun|ger, they would Roa&s;t it Alive. The Child began to Swell. A Cannow arrived at that In&s;tant, with a Dog in it. The le&s;&s;er Devils of the Crue, propo&s;ed their taking the Dog in&s;tead of the Child; they did &s;o, and the Child is yet Living! Her Name is <HI>Hannah Par&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>A Man had Valiantly Killed an Indian or two before the Sal|vages took him. He was next Morning to undergo in horrible Death, whereof the Manner and the Torture was to be a&s;&s;igned by the Widow <HI>Squa</HI> of the Dead Indian. The French Prie&s;ts told him, they had indeavoured to divert the Tygres from their bloody Intention, but could not prevail with them; he mu&s;t prepare for the terrible Execution, His cries to God were hard, and heard; when the Sentence of the <HI>Squa</HI> was demanded, quite contrary to every ones Expectation, and the Revengeful Inclination &s;o u&s;ual and well-known among the&s;e Creatures, &s;he only &s;aid, <HI>His Death won't fetch my Husband to Life; Do nothing to him!</HI> So nothing was done to him.</P>
<P>A Woman was carried a&s;ide, by her Mon&s;ter of a Ma&s;ter; he fa&s;tned a Rope about her Neck; it was in vain for her to con|tend, the Hatchet mu&s;t pre&s;ently have di&s;patched her, if the Halter had failed; &s;he had no Remedy but to Cry unto God: Her Ma|&s;ter throws up the end of the Rope over a Limb of a Tree; he a&s;|cends to hale her and tye her up; and then a fine Exploit for the Wretch! a <HI>memorable Name!</HI> However the Limb happily breaks down he falls; full of madne&s;s he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian Commander ju&s;t in the Nick of Time comes in upon him; Reproaches him very bitterly; Takes her away from him; and &s;ends her to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>But we ought not to pa&s;s over the marvellous Di&s;play of the Power of God, in &s;upporting and pre&s;erving the poor Captives when they Travelled thro' the horrid Wilderne&s;s, oftentimes much more than a &s;core of Miles in a day, and thro' very deep Snows;
<PB N="33" REF="001331_0038_0FB27D0B52AFDBF8">
and with va&s;t Loads on their Backs, and grievou&s;ly pinched with Hunger, having &s;carce one bit of any Refre&s;hment, for whole days together. Poor, Weak, &s;ick Women have done &s;o!</P>
<P>One cannot well imagine any other than Supernatural and Angelical a&s;&s;i&s;tances, in &s;ome of the in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Indians came upon the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Adams</HI> at <HI>Wells,</HI> and Captivated the Man and his Wife, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the Children; whereof one, who had an Hatchet &s;truck into his Skull, and was left for dead, was &s;trangely recovered. The Woman had Lain in about Eight Days. Thay drag'd her out, and tied her to a Po&s;t, until the Hou&s;e was rifled. They then loo&s;ed her, and bid her walk. She could not &s;tir. By the help of a Stick &s;he got half a &s;tep forward. She look'd up to God. On the &s;udden a new &s;trength entred into her. She travelled that very Day Twenty Miles a Foot: She was up to the Neck in Water &s;ix times that very Day in pa&s;&s;ing of Rivers. At night &s;he fell over head and ears, into a Slough in a Swamp, and was hardly got out alive. She got not the lea&s;t Cough nor Cold by all this: She is come home alive unto us.</P>
<P>Many more &s;uch In&s;tances might be mentioned. We will &s;uper|fede them all, with a Relation of what befel Mrs. <HI>Bradley</HI> of <HI>Ha|verly. Ab una Di&s;ce omnes.</HI></P>
<P>This Vertuous Woman had been formerly for Two Years together a Captive in the Hands of the Barbarous Indians; a &s;ubject of wondrous Afflctions, of wondrous Deliverances. Her Husband at length found her out, and fetch'd her home, and their Family went on happily for &s;ix years together after it. But, <HI>the Clouds return after the Rain.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>February</HI> 6, 1703-4. She with her Si&s;ter, and a Maid or two, and &s;ome Children, (a Man being al&s;o in the Room,) were talking about the Indians, and behold, one of the fierce <HI>Tawnies</HI> looked in, with a Gun ready to fire upon them. The <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> pull'd him in, and got him down, and Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> took the opportunity to pour a good quantity of &s;calding Soap, (which was then boyling over the Fire) upon him, whereby he was kill'd im|mediately, Another of the Tawnies follow'd at the Heels of his
<PB N="34" REF="001331_0039_0FB27D0CC6719110">
Brother, who &s;tabb'd the Engli&s;hman to the Heart. Unto him &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed al&s;o a quantity of her Sope, which not killing him, &s;he with the other Women and Children ran into the Chamber. The Hou&s;e was fired by the Indians, and Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> with her Com|panions found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire behind the Hou&s;e. One of the Women fell into the Hands of the Indians; and they that remai|ned were Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> and her Si&s;ter; each of them having a Child of Mrs. <HI>Bradlies</HI> with her. The Si&s;ter was di&s;cerned by the Indians, who commanded her to come out unto them, and threatned that they would el&s;e cut her to pieces. Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> very generou&s;ly bid her &s;it &s;till, and wait for a better time to e&s;cape; and offered her, that ina&s;much as the Indians knew of but one there, &s;he would be that one, and go out in her &s;tead. She did &s;o, and thereby her obliged Si&s;ter and the Child with her were pre&s;erved; but Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> was no &s;ooner come to the Salvages, but they employ'd a Head-breaker on the Child that &s;he brought unto them.</P>
<P>She was not entred into a Second Captivity; but &s;he had the great Encumbrance of being Big with Child, and within Six Weeks of her Time! After about an Hours Re&s;t, wherein they made her put on Snow Shoes, which to manage, requires more than ordinary agility, &s;he travelled with her Tawny Guardians all that night, and the next day until Ten a Clock, a&s;&s;ociated with one Woman more who had been brought to Bed but ju&s;t one Week be|fore&punc; Here they Refre&s;hed them&s;elves a little, and then travelled on till Night; when they had no Refre&s;hment given them, nor had they any, till after their having Travelled all the Forenoon of the day En&s;uing; and then too, whatever &s;he took, &s;he did thro' Sickne&s;s throw it up again.</P>
<P>She underwent incredible Hard&s;hips and Famine: A <HI>Moo&s;es</HI> Hide, as tough as you may Suppo&s;e it, was the be&s;t and mo&s;t of her Diet. In one and twenty days they came to their Head-Quarters, were they &s;tayed a Fortnight, But then her Snow-&s;hoes were taken from her; and yet &s;he mu&s;t go every &s;tep above the Knee in Snow, with &s;uch wearine&s;s, that her Soul often Pray'd, <HI>That the Lord would put an end unto her weary Life!</HI> until they came to another Place, where they &s;tay'd for three Weeks together,</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001331_0040_0FB27D10A12D7C08">Here in the Night &s;he found her &s;elf ill, and having the help of only one Woman, who got a little Hemlock to lay about her, and with a few &s;ticks made &s;hift to blow up a little Fire, &s;he was in half an Hour Delivered of the Infant, that &s;he had hitherto gone withal. There &s;he lay till the next Night, with none but the Snow under her, and the Heaven over her; in a mi&s;ty and rainy Sea&s;on. She &s;ent then unto a French Prie&s;t, that he would &s;peak unto her <HI>Squa Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> who then, without Conde&s;cending to look upon her, allow'd her a little Birch-Rind, to cover her Head from the Injuries of the Weather, and a little bit of dried Moo&s;e, which be|ing boiled, &s;he drunk the Broth, and gave it unto the Child.</P>
<P>In a Fortnight &s;he was called upon to Travel again, with her Child in her Arms; every now and then, a whole day to|gether, without the lea&s;t Mor&s;el of any Food, and when &s;he had any, &s;he fed only on Ground-nuts and Wild-onions, and Lilly-roots. By the la&s;t of <HI>May</HI> they arrived at <HI>Cowe&s;ick,</HI> where they Planted their Corn; wherein &s;he was put unto a hard Task, &s;o that the Child extreamly Suffered. The Salvages would &s;ome times al&s;o plea&s;e them&s;elves, with ca&s;ting <HI>hot Embers</HI> into the Mouth of the Child, which would render the Mouth &s;o &s;ore, that it could not Suck for a long while together. So that it Starv'd and Dy'd.</P>
<P>There they &s;taid until they Wed their Corn, but then &s;ome of our Friend-Indians coming on them, kill'd Seven of them, whereat away they fled for <HI>Canada,</HI> and never &s;aw their Corn-field any more. But they made a Forty-days Ramble of it, before they reach'd thither, in which, if at any time, her Heart began to faint, her Mi|&s;tre&s;s would be ready to &s;trike the Mortal Hatchet into her Head,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="001331_0041_0FB27D13C0FAC350">The <HI>French</HI> being thought more Civil to the Engli&s;h than to the Indians, her Mi&s;tre&s;s thereat Provoked, re&s;olved, that &s;he would never Sell her to the <HI>French.</HI> Accordingly &s;he kept her a Twelve-month with her, in her Squalid <HI>Wigwam:</HI> Where, in the follow|ing Winter, &s;he fell &s;ick of a Feavour; but in the very heighth and heat of her Paroxy&s;ms, her Mi&s;tre&s;s would compel her &s;ome|times to Spend a Winters-night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter Fro&s;t and Snow of the Climate. She reco|vered; but Four Indians died of the Feavour, and at length her Mi|&s;tre&s;s al&s;o. Another Squa then pretended an Heir&s;hip unto her, with whom &s;he lived, and &s;aw many more &s;trange Deliverances. They had the Small-Pox in the Family; but &s;he never had it. She was made to pa&s;s the River on the Ice, when every &s;tep &s;he took, &s;he might have &s;truck through it if &s;he plea&s;ed Many more &s;uch Pre&s;ervations might come into her Story.</P>
<P>At La&s;t, there came to the &s;ight of her a Prie&s;t from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> who had known her in her former Captivity at <HI>Naridgewock.</HI> He was very Civil to Her, and made the <HI>Indians</HI> Sell her to a French Family, for Four&s;core Livers, where tho' &s;he wrought hard, &s;he Lived more comfortably and contentedly.</P>
<P>She poured out her continoal Supplications to Heaven; Some|times Two or Three of her own Sex, would by Stealth, come to joyn with her in Supplicating to the Glorious LORD.

<HEAD>A Letter from a Captive at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 18. 1703.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of my now Writing to you is becau&s;e I lye under a Vow and Promi&s;e to the Great and Almighty God, to declare and make Known his wonderful Goodne&s;s and Mercy to me, and livewi&s;e to have His Name Ble&s;&s;ed and Prai&s;ed in your Congregation on my Behalf. I &s;hall briefly Inform you.</P>
<P>Being taken a Pri&s;oner &s;ome time la&s;t <HI>January</HI> by the <HI>French:</HI> in going to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> we met with very Tempe&s;tuous Weather, and were fa&s;t in an Harbour near Cape <HI>Sables.</HI> And here two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> had Or|ders from their Captain to take me with them, and go to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> by Land. They took with them but little Bread; and we Travelled one Night in the Woods in a mi&s;erable Condition. I had my &s;elf no Shoes nor Stockings, but a piece of Skin wrapt about about my Feet; and the Snow being very deep, we could not Travel, being Weak for want of Provi&s;ion, and lo&s;t in the Woods, not knowing which way to go.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="001331_0044_0FB27D201D513FC0">One of the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> Loaded his Gun, and Pre&s;ent|ed it at me, telling me, <HI>That it was impo&s;&s;ible to find</HI> Port-Royal, <HI>I mu&s;t Dye, and they mu&s;t Eat me.</HI> Then I begged leave to Pray unto God, before he Kill'd me, and he Granted it. As I was at Prayer, it &s;truck in|to my Mind, That I had formerly heard your &s;elf declare in your Pulpit, what Great and Wonderful Things hath been done by Prayer; particularly, <HI>That it had &s;topped the Mouths of Lions, and that it had Quen|ched the Violence of the Fire.</HI> So I earne&s;ty begged of God, that he would manife&s;t his great Power to me, by turning the Hearts of tho&s;e that were about to take away my Life.</P>
<P>The Words were no &s;ooner out of my Mouth, but the <HI>Frenchman</HI> &s;eeming to have Tears in his Eyes, bid me ri&s;e up; he would try one Day longer. And he bid me go and get Wood for a Fire. It pre&s;ently grew Dark; and then I made an E&s;cape from them, and hid my &s;elf in the Woods, until the next Day that they were gone; and then I found the way out of the Woods, unto the Water-&s;ide, where I got <HI>Clams.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>French-men</HI> found the way to <HI>Port-royal,</HI> and there told what they had done. The Governour put them in Pri&s;on, and &s;ent out Two Men, and Charg|ed them not to return, until they had found me, Dead or Alive. In Four Days after the&s;e <HI>Frenchmen</HI> left me, they found me Alive, and brought me Provi&s;ion, and a Pair of Shoes, and carried me to <HI>Port-royal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001331_0045_0FB37DC9512C31C8">The&s;e and many other Favours have I received from my Good God in the time of my Impri|&s;onment; Ble&s;&s;ed and for ever Prai&s;ed be his Holy Name for it. Pray, Sir, give me Directions what I &s;hall do for the Great and Good GOD.</P>

<P>OUr Ea&s;tern Indians had no &s;ooner, with all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;urance renewed their League of Peace with us, but being moved by the In&s;tigation of the <HI>French,</HI> they Perfidiou&s;ly and Barbarou&s;ly Sur|prized Seven more of our naked and &s;ecure Plantations; and co|ming at once into the &s;cattered Families, they did, on <HI>August</HI> 10, 11. 1703: Reward the Ho&s;pitable Civilities that were &s;hown them, with the Murder of above Seventy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People, and the Captivity of near an Hundred.

<P>About half a year after the&s;e Calamities thus begun on the <HI>Ea&s;t|ern</HI> Parts of the Country, the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had a ta&s;te of the &s;ame Cup given to them.

<P>They Surpri&s;ed the Place about an Hour or Two before Break of Day, and in a little time, not without Lo&s;s to them&s;elves, Butch|ered and Captivated above 150 of the People.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> the Worthy Mini&s;ter of that Pious and Holy Flock, was carried into Captivity, with Five of his Children; two of which were Slain; and his De&s;irable Con&s;ort beginning to Faint at about a Dozen Miles of the doleful Journey, they there, like them|&s;elves, cruelly Murdered her, and left her for the Funeral which her Friends afterwards be&s;tow'd on her. Before they reach'd unto <HI>Mont Real,</HI> a Journey di&s;patch'd by the Parcels now divided in Twenty Days, more or le&s;s, near Twenty more of the Captives lo&s;t their Lives; for the manner was, that if any found them&s;elves not able to Travel thro' the Deep Snows now on the Ground, the Salvages would &s;trike their Hatchets into their Heads, and there leave them weltring in their Blood.</P>
