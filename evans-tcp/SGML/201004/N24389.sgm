<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TOGETHER with the&s;e Letters, I beg leave to lay before my Readers &s;ome account of the &s;teps by which I was induced to write them, and to &s;olicit the exerci&s;e of candor and indulgence to their Author.</P>
<P>I had gone to Sierra Leone with the hope of doing &s;omething towards the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a Mi&s;&s;ion to the natives; and, after a re&s;idence of fourteen months, I returned to England, from a conviction that I could not effect my purpo&s;e. I am fully of opi|nion that Mi&s;&s;ions would &s;ucceed in tho&s;e parts, if they were taken up with proper &s;pirit, and conducted in a proper manner. The natives are friendly and tractable, and appear de&s;irous of information in religion as well as in letters. The lives and proper|ties of Mi&s;&s;ioners would be &s;afe&punc; The <HI>nece&s;+&s;aries</HI> of life would be found plentiful and cheap; and European accomodations (as far as it is compatible with &s;uch an under|taking) might be procured at Free-Town, Bence I&s;land, or from the &s;hips which trade in that river. Independent of other un|plea&s;ant things, which apply pretty gene|rally to all Mi&s;&s;ions, I know nothing pecul|iar as objectionable to African Mi&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="iv" REF="032281_0003_0FF1B199CFD223F0">but the matter of health. The in&s;alubrity of the climate has indeed been much exag|gerated, but it will ever remain an incon|te&s;tible truth, that the children of the North do not generally enjoy health and longevity under the line. Perhaps the heat of Bengal may be greater than that of Sierra Leone; but until the la&s;t place be brought into the &s;ame &s;tate of cultivation as the fir&s;t, it will not be found &s;o healthy. Great improve|ments are daily making at Free Town, and the benefits, which re&s;ult from them, in re&s;|pect of health, are already felt in the Colo|ny. But African Mi&s;&s;ionaries cannot enjoy the advantages of Free Town. They mu&s;t, I conceive, become inhabitants of the na|tive villages, and as tho&s;e villages &s;eldom contain more than &s;ixty or eighty adults, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that, to effect the conver|&s;ion of the natives, Mi&s;&s;ionaries mu&s;t be|come itinerant, as well as &s;tationary: &s;o that they will be obliged to take the country as it is. Whether any Gentleman will come forward to countenance Mi&s;&s;ions there, or whether Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters of any deno|mination will embark in the undertaking, time mu&s;t determine.</P>
<P>I &s;aid I returned to England from a con|viction that I could not effect my purpo&s;e&mdash;this requires explanation. I could not per|&s;uade my&s;elf to take a &s;ickly, delicate wo|man and young children, and place them
<PB N="v" REF="032281_0004_0FF1B19CD40624F8">in an African wood, where I mu&s;t leave them for one half of my time, while I was engaged in rambling from village to village. Acquainted as I am with their health and habits, I could hardly indulge a rational hope of their being able to &s;upport the hard|&s;hips of &s;uch a life for many months. Had I con&s;idered this point well, I had never gone to Sierra Leone; but, mi&s;led by my partial attachments, I hoped what I wi&s;hed rather than what I had rea&s;on to expect. I hoped I might unite the Chaplain&s;hip of Free Town with my mi&s;&s;ionary pur&s;uits, and by that means reconcile the duty I owed to my family, by providing them needful accomodations, with that duty I owed to God, in propagating his truth&punc; But I had &s;oon rea&s;on to &s;ee that my hopes, in that re&s;pect were unfounded and chimerical.&mdash;Whether this rea&s;on for my return will be thought &s;atisfactory by others I don't know; but it is &s;o to my own con&s;cience. This, as far as I know my&s;elf, was my <HI>principal</HI> rea&s;on for relinqui&s;hing the undertaking; for though I had other rea&s;ons of con&s;i|derable weight which concurred to influence my conduct, yet I believe &s;uch is my predi|liction for the &s;ervice, that had I been a &s;in|gle man, I &s;hould have per&s;i&s;ted in my pur|po&s;e notwith&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances of my judgment. The rea&s;ons I refer to are the following. The more I con&s;idered the na|ture
<PB N="vi" REF="032281_0005_0FF1B19E841AD7A0">of a Mi&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially in a country like Africa wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the tribes are thinly &s;cat|tered, the more I was convinced that very little was to be done by one man, or even by three or four men. As a mini&s;ter of the e&s;tabli&s;hment I did not dare hope to find mini&s;ters to act with me. If in this I have wronged the Church to which I belong I am ready to a&s;k pardon; and &s;hall rejoice to find facts to di&s;prove my judgment, and to &s;hame my temerity. Whether other Mi&s;|&s;ionaries would be &s;ent there, with whom I could act in uni&s;on was very problematical. From the &s;mall &s;ample I had of the hard|&s;hips and &s;ufferings of &s;uch an undertaking, I had room to entertain a very &s;erious doubt whether I had piety and &s;trength of mind for a Mi&s;&s;ion. The united force of all the&s;e rea&s;ons determined my judgment, and, per|haps, ever will determine it, to decline all per&s;onal engagement in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>If my readers are curious to know, whe|ther I did nothing in Africa as a Mi&s;&s;ionary, I am &s;orry that a regard for truth obliges me to an&s;wer, <HI>nothing</HI> but preach one &s;ingle &s;er|mon, by means of an interpreter. If they &s;till enquire but could you do no more? I confe&s;s ingenuou&s;ly, I might have done more than I did; but nothing like what tho&s;e who are unacquainted with my &s;itua|tion there may expect I ought to have done. I had gone out with a full determination to
<PB N="vii" REF="032281_0006_0FF1B1A01A64AB08">&s;pend &s;ome months at King Nambanna's town, which is on a &s;mall i&s;land about ten miles from Free Town, and I had every rea&s;on to promi&s;e my&s;elf all kindne&s;s and encouragement from that worthy old man. But it was four months before my Colleague joined me, and &s;et me at liberty from the re|&s;traints of the colonial chaplain&s;hip. At this critical time, when I was preparing to go to Robanna, the king was &s;inking under a malady which in a few weeks carried him off. His town then became the &s;eat of bac|chanal riot for two or three months, while the King's Cry, or funeral rites were cele|brated; and, not many weeks after, my Colleague was called to the We&s;t Indies, when my duty in the Colony, finally exclud|ed the po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;iding any time among the natives. I might have preached a dozen or twenty &s;ermons in the &s;ame way I preached the fir&s;t, and my rea&s;on for not doing &s;o, is not much to my honor. The truth is, I &s;aw I could not carry my point&mdash;I felt I had acted precipitately&mdash;I charged my&s;elf with folly and vanity&mdash;I lamented having left my Pari&s;h in England&mdash;and having placed my&s;elf in a &s;ituation to which I began to think divine providence had never called me&mdash;I had &s;truggled through much oppo&s;ition&mdash;&s;uffered &s;ome reproach&mdash;and had &s;taked all I had to &s;take, on an engagement of which I could make little or nothing&mdash;and
<PB N="viii" REF="032281_0007_0FF1B1A7A6BFDC60">I anticipated every reproach and cen&s;ure I was to &s;uffer when I return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to England. My &s;pirits were broken, &s;leep and appetite for&s;ook me, and my health &s;uffered infinite|ly more from the exerci&s;es of my mind, than in did from the influence of climate, and from di&s;ea&s;e. Not being able to do what I wi&s;hed rendered me incapable of do|ing what was really in my power. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved that preaching four or five time a week in the Colony, was &s;ome labor; and that as in the la&s;t few months the rains and a &s;mart fever impeded my ac|tivity, &s;o for the fir&s;t four months after my arrival, I could find no place to lay my head a&s;hore, and my confinement on &s;hip board was not favorable to my mi&s;&s;ionary pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P>Un&s;ucce&s;sful in my own attempts, I could not dive&s;t my&s;elf of the intere&s;t I took in Mi&s;&s;ions; nor could I conceive that the failure of a hundred attempts of the kind ought to di&s;courage Chri&s;tians from obeying the plain commands of Chri&s;t, and di&s;charg|ing a duty which would be obligatory &s;o long as there were Heathens in the world. The &s;ubject appeared to me to &s;leep in ob|&s;curity. I perceived there were rea&s;ons why Mini&s;ters declined calling general at|tention to it. One of the fir&s;t things a man would here, who &s;hould write to engage others in Mi&s;&s;ions is. Why do you not engage
<PB N="ix" REF="032281_0008_0FF1B1A9315D9E78">in Mi&s;&s;ions your&s;elf? He would find much to cen&s;ure, and little to commend; and we all know the inevitable con&s;equence&mdash;<HI>retati|ation.</HI> If he mean reproof &s;hould be effec|tual, he mu&s;t pre&s;s it home; and when that reproof came addre&s;&s;ed to the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, he could not avoid &s;ome appearance of arrogance and &s;elf-opinion. Neverthele&s;s, I thought it ought to be done by &s;ome body; and as I had gone &s;o far, I was willing to go a little farther. I had &s;uffered &s;ome|thing, and I determined whatever the con|&s;equences might be of laying the &s;ubject be|fore the world, I would meet them, rather than leave any thing undone which I could do to &s;erve the Heathens. I therefore wrote the&s;e letters before I left Africa, and after much he&s;itation, and being often ready to throw them in the fire, they are now print|ed. Since they came from the pre&s;s, I have had an opportunity of collecting the opinions of &s;everal friends, &s;ome of which were of a nature &s;o far from flattering and plea&s;ant to my feelings, that I immediately &s;topped the &s;ale of them, and have delibe|rated earne&s;tly whether I &s;hould not con|&s;ign them to oblivion. But after continu|ing &s;ome days in a &s;tate of painful &s;u&s;pence, I determined to venture them into the world, only cancelling the fir&s;t preface and &s;ub&s;tituting another, in which I would en|deavor to &s;upport my claim to be treated
<PB N="x" REF="032281_0009_0FF1B1ADB03245A8">with candor, ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s what I conceive to be the faul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of my book, and promi&s;e if I lived to make a &s;econd edition, to &s;trike out, or correct every pa&s;&s;age which I can deem as really objectionable.</P>
<P>That I have failed, in &s;ome re&s;pects, in writing the&s;e Letters I can ea&s;ily believe. I ventured on no ea&s;y ta&s;k; and it might well have exerci&s;ed the humility, meekne&s;s, courage, and wi&s;dom of the mo&s;t aged and experienced Mini&s;ter, to have delivered the truths I have done, in &s;uch a manner as not to expo&s;e him&s;elf to reproach on one or other quarter. What I thought truth in my &s;ecret &s;oul, I have avowed openly on the hou&s;e top, without re&s;erve, and without palliation. But accu&s;tomed to receive the mo&s;t mortifying truth my&s;elf, I have not been &s;ufficiently careful to reeommend it to my readers by &s;oftening the &s;everity of her a&s;pect. Occupied wholly with the import|ance and dignity of the &s;ubject, I have neg|lected to conciliate that e&s;teem for the wri|ter, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to gain attention to the &s;ubject it&s;elf. The &s;ubject unhappi|ly called for &s;evere cen&s;ure, and I was more warmly intere&s;ted in it than on any other which could have employed my pen. I feared lenient applications would defeat my purpo&s;e in writing, and in bending all my &s;trength to enforce what I had to ad|vance, and to be felt as well as read, I may
<PB N="xi" REF="032281_0010_0FF1B1AF3A55F1D8">have been betrayed into a degree of a&s;peri|ty, which carries in it an air of &s;elf-import|ance, and of di&s;re&s;pect to my Brethern in the mini&s;try. On a favorite &s;ubject I may have played the egoti&s;t. Having never be|fore u&s;ed my pen in this way, I have deri|ved no aid from tho&s;e decencies of addre&s;s, to which he is accu&s;tomed, who is practi&s;ed in the habit of writing. That I have been in any degree actuated by malice I am un|con&s;cious; and, for a moment, to degrade and vilify the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, was as far from my intention as to bla&s;pheme Him they &s;erve. If I have pained any worthy mind, but e&s;pecially if I have injured reli|gion and her Mini&s;ters, I &s;hall not only la|ment it as my misfortune, but in the pre|&s;ence of God confe&s;s it as my <HI>Sin,</HI> with &s;hame and &s;orrow. Having meant well, &s;hall never ju&s;tify me to my&s;elf for having expre&s;&s;ed my good intentions with impro|per language, and in an improper &s;pirit.&mdash;I wi&s;h the raph&s;odical addre&s;s to Europe in the Eighth Letter had been exchanged for a few &s;trong facts and plain arguments. I wi&s;h the la&s;t few &s;entences of my cen&s;ures on the Ea&s;t India Company had been ex|punged from my Seventh Letter, as petu|lent and irritating&mdash; I wi&s;h the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eer of the Infidel in the la&s;t Letter, and the manner of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Mini&s;ters on the 142 page had been wholly expunged, or &s;o cor|rected
<PB N="xii" REF="032281_0011_0FF1B1B3A93E4DC8">as not to expo&s;e my&s;elf to be mi&s;ta|ken. I wi&s;h I had &s;oftened &s;everal other &s;trong touches of my pen, and that the whole book breathed more affection, and had le&s;s &s;pirit. But were I to write the whole over again, I fear while I corrected one fault I &s;hould commit another. In|deed&punc; if the heavie&s;t cen&s;ure that has been pa&s;&s;ed on my Letters be ju&s;t, they ought to be de&s;troyed; for &s;hould I write them ten times over, they will always have &s;tamped upon them the characters of my own mind. If vanity be their prominent feature, I &s;hall not ea&s;ily learn to be meek and lowly in heart; and until I can regenerate my&s;elf entirely, whatever I write will have one or other di&s;gu&s;ting feature of the man of &s;in. But whatever the &s;entiments of good men may be of me and my poor performance. I promi&s;e to labor to conform to them; for it will be &s;afer to &s;tand by their opinion than by my own.</P>
<P>I hope the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of this preface m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y claim &s;ome indulgence; but, if to the trifling &s;orrows I have already experienced in a fruitle&s;s attempt to &s;erve poor heathens, this la&s;t effort on their behalf, in&s;tead of producing active commi&s;eration for them, &s;hall only draw upon my&s;elf cen&s;ure and contempt. I will &s;ee the hand of heaven, and if I cannot add to the zeal of my Bre|thren, I will endeavor to avail my&s;elf of
<PB N="xiii" REF="032281_0012_0FF1B1B532EAA330">every help they afford me to cultivate my own humility. But before I take my leave may I not &s;ubmit to &s;uch of my readers as fear God the following queries? Can a fleet|ing more&punc; like me, ob&s;cure the &s;un? Shall my faults call more &s;trongly for your cen&s;ure than the mi&s;eries of millions call for your pity and relief? Should the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t be implicated with the defects of a character like mine? Will gold become dro&s;s in the hand of a &s;hoe-black, or one truth in this book be fal&s;ified becau&s;e it is written by my pen?</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave to pre&s;ent my tribute of the general approbation due to the Rev. Mr. Carey, a Mini&s;ter of the Particular Bapti&s;ts, for publi&s;hing two years ago, "An Enquiry into the Obliga|tion of Chri&s;tians to u&s;e means for the Con|ver&s;ion of the Heathens." I recommend the peru&s;al of this treati&s;e to my Readers; and, if it may operate as an inducement with them to comply with my reque&s;t, I have the plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;ure them, that Gen|tleman has given to his precepts the force of example, by actually embarking in a Mi&s;&s;ion to India.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethren in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the pulpit, and from the pre&s;s, we fre|quently hear loud calls on Chri&s;tians to re&s;|pect the intere&s;ts of their &s;everal Churches. One while, we of the E&s;tabli&s;hment turn the attention of our brethern to the alarming progre&s;s of Di&s;|&s;enters, and exhort each other to a &s;kilful oppo&s;i|tion again&s;t Sectaries. Another while, Di&s;&s;enters rou&s;e the languid zeal of their people, de&s;canting on the excellence of their own modes of faith and wor&s;hip, and indulging vehement invective again&s;t the avarice, the &s;loth, and the lordline&s;s of Epi&s;|copalians. We talk of the <HI>Intere&s;ts of the E&s;tab|li&s;hment, the Di&s;&s;enting Cau&s;e, the Bapti&s;t and In|dependent Intere&s;t, the Methodi&s;t Cau&s;e,</HI> and the
<PB N="2" REF="032281_0014_0FF1B1BB8E3D7E18">like, until we lo&s;e &s;ight of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, the Common Intere&s;ts</HI> of mankind, and the diligent, peaceable &s;ervice of our Ma&s;ter. Thus do we for&s;ake the &s;ublime of religion, &s;ink into the mean|ne&s;s of partizans, and in&s;pire our flocks with a fierce, &s;ectarian zeal. We fir&s;t baptize our &s;ecular intere&s;ts and evil tempers into the name of the di&s;|intere&s;ted and lowly Je&s;us; and, then, contend for them, with as much warmth and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nacity, as tho' they involved our &s;alvation. Is not this to fight for Barabbas, and to crucify Je&s;us?</P>
<P>While we are engaged after this goodly &s;ort, in|fidelity increa&s;es, immoralities are multiplied, the &s;pirit of the world domineers in the Church; and its pomps and vanities in&s;ult the &s;tandard of the cro&s;s. While the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;leep, and indulge their ea&s;e; while they &s;acrifice to the gra|ces and mu&s;es; while they a&s;pire to the reputation of polite learning, or profound &s;cience; while they toil in philo&s;ophical re&s;earch, or in planting and watering the tree of civil liberty, our Adver&s;ary &s;leeps not. With unwearied vigilance, he makes head again&s;t the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and, not con|tent with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his own dominions in peace, he wars on the little territory of Je&s;us, makes bold inroads into the heart of Chri&s;tendom, and &s;trives to di&s;po&s;e&s;s us of what we have won from his em|pire, by the labor of ages, and with the blood of an army of martyrs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent &s;tate of France &s;trongly proves the a&s;&s;ertion.</NOTE></P>
<P>But a few years have elap&s;ed, &s;ince a learned Engli&s;hman entered upon a calculation to &s;hew, that were the habitable world divided into thirty parts, nineteen would be claimed by the Heathen, &s;ix would fall to the Mahometan, and five only would remain to be apportioned among the divided
<PB N="3" REF="032281_0015_0FF1B1C00BFB3320">followers of the catholic Je&s;us. Whether this calculation be &s;trictly accurate is of trivial con&s;e|quence; but we mu&s;t all be deeply affected by the lamentable view of human nature which it affords us. Alas! if every &s;incere Chri&s;tian may &s;ay, with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>My heart teacheth me the wick|edne&s;s of the ungodly;</HI> and, if to this, he may add, as we all allow he may, My own hou&s;e, my own favorite &s;ect, my own privileged country, and the Chri&s;tian Church, give &s;ad te&s;timony to the exten&s;ive &s;overeignty exerci&s;ed by the God of this world, To what conclu&s;ion are we led with re&s;pect to the religious &s;tate of the Heathen and Mahometan nations?</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion is obvious: if the nature of man be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, in every age and climate; and, if the Chri&s;tian religion be true, the people, who have not our advantages, mu&s;t greatly &s;uffer from the want of them; and bad as Chri&s;tendom is, the Heathen world mu&s;t be much wor&s;e, being &s;unk more deeply than our&s;elves in <HI>po&s;itive</HI> igno|rance and vice. If this mode of rea&s;oning be thought exceptionable, I appeal to matter of fact, as far as we are acquainted with it, by tho&s;e who have vi&s;ited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> is a can|did acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">s. Should a more elaborate proof be required, it can|not be called for by any man to whom the&s;e letters are addre&s;&s;ed. Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters are too well acquainted with the grand, exclu&s;ive privileges of Chri&s;tianity, to admit a doubt of what I a&s;&s;ert. Whatever &s;entiments, Reverend Brethern, may be entertained by others on this &s;ubject, you cannot be ungrateful for the ble&s;&s;ings of revelation; and, whil&s;t you rejoice in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, you mu&s;t have a benevolent de&s;ire to communicate them to a peo|ple, <HI>who know not the only true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent.</HI></P>

When we con&s;ider this deep &s;piritual poverty of a major part of our fellow-men, we are admoni&s;h|ed, that it becomes us to do &s;omething for their re|lief. On this we &s;eem agreed; but, I am &s;orry to remark, that we agree, more generally, to neglect our duty, than to acknowlege its obliga|tion. Satisfied with the cold approbation of a du|ty, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for us not to feel, we di&s;|mi&s;s pro&s;pects of wretchedne&s;s too oppre&s;&s;ive for our faith and love; and con&s;ole our&s;elves with the unintel|ligible hope, that the Almighty will execute, &s;ome|how, and at &s;ome time, by worthier hands, a work too great, and too dangerous, for us little men.</P>
<P>Fathers, Brethren, Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in the pre&s;ence of God, I charge you&mdash;I charge my&s;elf, with betraying the grand intere&s;ts of our Ma&s;ter, by refu&s;ing to propagate his go&s;pel. I charge you with the habitual, open violation of Chri&s;t's com|mand, <HI>Go, preach the Go&s;pel to every creature.</HI> I charge you with the un&s;peakable guilt of burying in a napkin, tho&s;e un&s;earchable riches, which the Apo&s;tle St. Paul thought it the honor of his life to preach to the Gentiles. La&s;tly, I charge you with doing this without &s;hame, without remor&s;e, and, almo&s;t without an effort to do the contrary. The&s;e, Reverend Brethren, are heavy charges; but I &s;hall not find it difficult to avoid the puni&s;hment of a calumniator, by &s;ub&s;tantiating them in the progre&s;s of the&s;e letters, which have for their ob|ject the &s;pread of the Go&s;pel, and the &s;alvation of the Heathen.</P>
<P>To this object, therefore, I &s;olicit your attention. And, by the mercies of God, I be&s;eech you&mdash;by the blood of Je&s;us, and by our common hope, grant me a patient hearing. Suffer not my ob&s;curity to operate as a prejudice again&s;t the cau&s;e I plead. I neither deprecate your cen&s;ure, nor dare I de&s;pi&s;e it. But permit me to hope, that no infelicities of
<PB N="5" REF="032281_0017_0FF1B1C6294DA778">&s;tyle, nor defect of genius, nor of judgment, with which the &s;ubject is propo&s;ed, may be allowed to ob&s;cure its &s;plendor, or detract from its worth. Would to God that &s;ome one among you, who&s;e name is venerable among the Churches, had &s;tep|ped forward to &s;ave me from the odium of this ad|dre&s;s! But &s;ince You, who have characters to lo&s;e, do not care to hazard them by becoming reprovers in the mid&s;t of your brethren, allow me, who am without a name, to a&s;pire to the honor of incur|ring cen&s;ure for telling truths, which none of us like to hear, or wi&s;h to believe; and for telling them, with that plainne&s;s which they require.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider, on the one hand, the promi&s;e and faithfulne&s;s of God, who cannot lie, and, on the other, the noble cau&s;e I e&s;pou&s;e, I am animated with &s;trong confidence and hope. I come forward, not as a &s;ectary, nor as the leader of a &s;ect. I am not encumbered with polemic armour, nor heated with polemic zeal. It is not a que&s;tion in &s;cience, politics, or morals, which I lay before you. The &s;ubject I a&s;&s;ert involves the honor of our Religion, the &s;incerity of her Mini&s;ters, the glory of Chri&s;t, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of men. The delegation I pretend to is authoritative; and I am ju&s;tified in &s;peaking, with all boldne&s;s, the truths of the God I &s;erve, in the go&s;pel of his Son. Di&s;pen&s;e then, I be&s;eech you, with all com|plimentary forms; and allow me to addre&s;s you, with mini&s;terial freedom, and to plead the cau&s;e I have undertaken, with that undi&s;gui&s;ed and gene|rous warmth, which it is calculated to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>He that fears men, when he &s;hould &s;peak boldly for God; and timidly di&s;&s;embles truths, which, if felt aright, &s;hould be told with the &s;tronge&s;t tones of abhorrence, indignation, and contempt, will hardly &s;ucceed in writing upon Mi&s;&s;ions. The &s;ubject calls for enthu&s;ia&s;m. It requires vehe|mence
<PB N="6" REF="032281_0018_0FF1B1C8A837B720">Tho&s;e feelings which carried me acro&s;s the water, I &s;till cheri&s;h in my brea&s;t. They will never for&s;ake me. I rejoice in them. I with to impart them to every Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and to every child of God. This I cannot hope to do, if I di&s;gui&s;e or palliate them. It would concern me much to incur the cen&s;ure of treating my Brethren in the mini&s;try with indecent freedom; but I can|not think that truth, however &s;evere, will offend the &s;ervants of truth: or that any of my Brethren &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves entitled to u&s;e freedoms with the laity, which they will not bear from the meane&s;t of their own body. No, Brethren. While you critici&s;e my letters, you will applaud my de&s;ign. The e&s;teem you entertain for integrity will give mildne&s;s to your cen&s;ures; and, whatever faults your better judgment may di&s;cover in this perfor|mance, your good wi&s;hes will accompany it into the world, and your prayer of faith draw down the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon it.</P>
<P>From the mercenaries of the Chri&s;tian Church, my &s;oul turns with loathing. Though I could move mountains, they would remain immoveable. Though I could in&s;pire every real Chri&s;tian with all the &s;en&s;ations of my own heart, the unprincipled wretch; who &s;ees nothing in the go&s;pel mini&s;try but an affluent and genteel profe&s;&s;ion, is vulnera|ble to no &s;entiment contained in the&s;e letters. Like Simon Magus, he, has neither part nor lot in this matter&mdash;Nor have I any thing to do with <HI>mere</HI> mo|rali&s;ts. The waters flow no higher than their &s;prings. The &s;pirit of the&s;e letters is. I flatter my&s;elf, the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t&mdash;a &s;pirit which they have not re|ceived, and, with the things of which, they are unacquainted. In their good opinion, I &s;hall, therefore, think my&s;elf to &s;tand high, if I may pa&s;s for a well-meaning enthu&s;ia&s;t. Under God, Reverend Brethren, my hopes re&s;t on You, who
<PB N="7" REF="032281_0019_0FF131089D4BF060">are what you are called, <HI>Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters</HI>&mdash;on you who were indeed <HI>moved</HI> to engage in the Mini&s;|try <HI>by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and are animated by a &s;in|cere love of the Savior who &s;o greatly loved you, and by a real regard for the lo&s;t &s;heep, for whom our great Shepherd died. You feel your charac|ter. You have bowels and mercies. You are the di&s;intere&s;ted benefactors of mankind, and whatever concerns the kingdom of your Lord you call your own. For you the&s;e letters are written, and to you they belong. But, in them your pious flocks will, al&s;o, claim a part, as large as that intere&s;t, which they have in the Son of David.</P>
<P>As the elect of God, holy and beloved, let us, then, mind the things of Chri&s;t, to whom we are &s;et apart as a peculiar people; and revolve all po&s;|&s;ible means of advancing that glorious kingdom, for the coming of which we daily pray. Such me|ditations will di&s;po&s;e our hearts to peace. They will beat down many controverted &s;ubjects, of ap|parent magnitude, to the humble level of their real importance. As we mu&s;e the fire will kindle; and our Churches and public Meetings, our fa|milies and clo&s;ets &s;hall atte&s;t the animated devotion, with which one Spirit &s;hall teach us to cry, <HI>Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God, yea, let all the people prai&s;e thee!</HI> On a &s;ubject like this, we cannot think long without feeling its attractions. It will teach us to make our reque&s;ts to the In&s;pirer of every great de&s;ign; and, then, to re&s;t on his grace, his power, and his faithfulne&s;s, to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of our hearts. As we advance, di&s;cou|ragements will vani&s;h. Ob&s;tacles will be over|come, when we learn to think them &s;urmountable. Difficulties will be &s;ubdued, as we acquire courage to cope with them. And, when the honor, glory, and immortality of our ine&s;timable reward, are &s;et full in our view, no forms of death and &s;uffering
<PB N="8" REF="032281_0020_0FF1B1CF01189FD8">will affright us. In&s;tead of that de&s;pondency, which has long frozen our benevolent wi&s;hes, hope, like the returning &s;un, will bring an early &s;pring and fruitful &s;ummer on our &s;ouls. The &s;pirit of our religion, lulled to lethargic &s;lumbers, will re|vive with the energies of the apo&s;tolic age; and the Church will again become illu&s;trious, by her victories over the kingdoms of this world.</P>
<P>And Thou, Lord Je&s;us, afflicted Father of the Chri&s;tian Name, ble&s;&s;ed Martyr of Humanity, blamele&s;s Pattern, univer&s;al Prie&s;t, unerring Teacher, omnipotent King of Truth, of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and of peace, deign from thy glorious throne to &s;mile on this weak attempt, and to ac|cept this poor offering! It is a tribute I pre&s;ent, for the life thou ha&s;t given, for the blood thou ha&s;t &s;hed, and for the joyous hopes thou ha&s;t in&s;pired, to cheer, and to direct my mortal pilgrimage. Meek Spring of heavenly Wi&s;dom, boundle&s;s Ocean of univer&s;al, ardent, unprovoked, and un|di&s;couraged Charity, pour thy Spirit into my brea&s;t, and into the brea&s;ts of all thy &s;ervants whom I here addre&s;s. Teach me and them to intere&s;t our&s;elves in this ble&s;&s;ed work, as becomes men, who are di&s;|tingui&s;hed by thy venerable name, and honored by the mini&s;tration of thy glorious go&s;pel! Baptize us with the fire of that love which is &s;tronger than death! Delightfully oppre&s;s our gratitude with the everla&s;ting mountains of thy benefits, until every &s;entiment of frail mortality be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;until faith give us the victory over the world&mdash;over life and death, until love compel us to exclaim, <HI>Yea, doubtle&s;s, and I count all things but dro&s;s that I may win Chri&s;t; and I am willing not only to &s;uffer bonds, but to die for the &s;ake of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom I am crucified unto the world and the world to me.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>SECOND LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE genius and &s;pirit of our religion, the cha|racters a&s;cribed to our Lord of the Second Adam, of the High Prie&s;t after the order of Mel|chizedeck, and of a Savior to all people, with ma|ny others of &s;imilar &s;ignificance; the various &s;crip|tures, which &s;peak of the benefits of his death and interce&s;&s;ion, of his kingdom and reign; the pro|phecies and promi&s;es, loudly declare the intention of God, that this la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect di&s;pen&s;ation of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel &s;hould be the religion of every tribe, and kindred, and tongue. Nay, we are repeatedly a&s;&s;ured, in the mo&s;t explicit lan|guage, that it &s;hall be &s;o&mdash;that the truth and mercy, the peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Me&s;&s;iah's king|dom, whatever temporary checks they may &s;uffer, &s;hall, in the end, overcome all oppo&s;ition; and that altho' the river of God may, for a time, be di&s;co|lored and polluted, by the pernicious &s;oil over
<PB N="10" REF="032281_0022_0FF1B1D5216C4640">which it has rolled it's tide, yet it &s;hall, at la&s;t, free it&s;elf from every foreign mixture, and &s;end forth it's ten thou&s;and pure &s;treams, to gladden all the nations of the globe.</P>
<P>How ought our minds to be affected by the&s;e pro&s;pects? May we not infer from each article of this enumeration, and, much more, from the ag|gregate force of them all, that it is our obvious, bounden duty, as &s;ervants of God, as &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, and as friends of &s;uffering humanity, to exert all our &s;trength in di&s;&s;eminating the go&s;pel? Is it not in our power to do, or, at lea&s;t, to attempt &s;omething <HI>worthy</HI> of the cau&s;e? Have we not &s;hips, which vi&s;it every part of the world? Have we not money&mdash;money in abundance, if we were &s;atisfied to live with Chri&s;tian &s;implicity, and could be pre|vailed upon to part with it, as men &s;hould do, who have a better trea&s;ure in heaven? Have we not mini&s;ters who prefer this line of &s;ervice, and would gladly embark for the mo&s;t barbarous clime, if they were a&s;&s;ured of <HI>&s;pirited</HI> &s;upport, and had rea|&s;on to hope, that the fruits of their labor would not die with them&s;elves? And, if we really have it in our power thus to &s;erve mankind, and to &s;pread our Redeemer's glory, Is it not <HI>criminal, ba&s;e, infamous</HI> to neglect it? Is not this infatu|ated negligence an open violation of the precepts of both tables of the law? Do we love God, revere his maje&s;ty, approve his precepts, and con|ceive our&s;elves bound, by every tie, to &s;erve him, with all our talents, and with all our &s;trength? How does this love, this reverence, this approba|tion, this conviction, accord with the a&s;toni&s;hing coldne&s;s, with which we look upon a world, full of cruel habitations; where virtue and piety &s;kulk in corners; where &s;in is univer&s;al, uncontrolled and almo&s;t unchecked; where the Eternal Maje&s;ty is affronted by the abominable idols of the Hea|then,
<PB N="11" REF="032281_0023_0FF1B1D6A8CE3290">and the bea&s;tly image of a corrupt Chri&s;ti|anity.</P>
<P>We &s;ay, that to love our neighbor as our&s;elves, and to do unto all men as we would they &s;hould do unto us, is the con&s;entaneous voice of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, of the law and go&s;pel. We &s;ay well; but do we do as we &s;ay, and practice as we believe? Do we love in word and in tongue only, or in deed and in truth? Speak ye de&s;olate &s;hores of Africa; declare ye bloody fields of Indo&s;tan; bear your impartial te&s;timony, ye numerous i&s;lands of the We&s;tern and Pacific oceans! Alas! my Brethern, we dare not abide the i&s;&s;ue of the appeal. We have not done unto them, as we would, were circum&s;tances changed, that they &s;hould have done unto us. The riche&s;t fruit of our philanthropy has been a cold, ineffective pity. We have &s;aid, Be ye free, be ye civilized, be ye converted; but we have eaten as heartily, &s;lept as &s;oundly, dre&s;|&s;ed as expen&s;ively, and enjoyed every good thing within our gra&s;p as freely, as though they had been as happy as our&s;elves. We have had no fellow&s;hip with the Savior in his agony and bloody &s;weat, in his prayers and tears for the &s;alvation of mankind. Provided we may live in peace and comfort, do a little good in England, accumulate fortunes, marry wives, take care of our children, and <HI>creep</HI> into hea|ven at la&s;t, we appear &s;atisfied to leave our Ma&s;|&s;ter to propagate his own go&s;pel in the world.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;iderations, which mu&s;t have weight on ingenuous minds, permit me to remind you of the &s;olemn &s;anction of divine command. The fol|lowing are &s;ome of the la&s;t emphatic words of Je|&s;us, as they &s;tand recorded by St. Mark &amp; St Mat-thew:&mdash;<HI>Go into all the world, and preach the go&s;|pel to every creature; and teach all nations, bapti|zing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="12" REF="032281_0024_0FF1B1D9C89DCF80">all things, which I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Shall we &s;ay, the&s;e injunctions were laid on the Apo&s;tles only? Impo&s;&s;ible! The genius of Chri&s;|tianity, and the &s;pirit of the precept, forbid, &s;uch an interpretation. Let it be ob&s;erved, 1&s;t. The Apo&s;tles did not preach the go&s;pel in many coun|tries beyond the limits of the Roman empire; and it was, in the nature of things, impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould preach it to all nations. 2. Had our Lord meant the command to oblige the Apo&s;tles only, it would have been &s;ufficient to promi&s;e his protection and ble&s;&s;ing to the end of their lives and mini&s;try, without adding that grand amplification, <HI>Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</HI> 3. The &s;ame rea&s;ons, why the Apo&s;|tles &s;hould preach the go&s;pel to every creature, ex|i&s;t in all their force at this day; and &s;o far from being antiquated and ob&s;olete, gain new &s;trength with the lap&s;e of ages. 4. Whatever exclu&s;ive privileges the Apo&s;tles enjoyed, as the fir&s;t pro|mulgators of Chri&s;tianity, yet the office and duty of every mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel is, in &s;pirit and &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame as theirs. From all the&s;e con|&s;iderations, it appears, that when our Lord &s;poke the&s;e authoritative words, he had in contemplation all his mini&s;ters of every age and nation, as well as his immediate di&s;ciples; and that we cannot re|fu&s;e engaging in mi&s;&s;ions, without contempt of his authority, and a &s;hameful derilection of our duty to God and men.</P>
<P>I made bold to charge you, Honorable Brethern, (implicating my&s;elf in the &s;ame charge) with be|traying the grand intere&s;ts of our Ma&s;ter, with the habitual, open violation of his commands, and with burying in a napkin the &s;acred depo&s;itum of the go&s;pel. I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into a
<PB N="13" REF="032281_0025_0FF1B1DB6A0AA648">formal proof of criminations, which the whole tenor of the&s;e letters is intended to &s;ub&s;tantiate. But, after adducing, from the Scriptures, the com|mi&s;&s;ion under which we act, and ju&s;tify our mini&s;|try in Britain, am I not authorized to appeal to your con&s;ciences, and a&s;k you, Whether you are not guilty of what I lay to your charge? What monies have we &s;ub&s;cribed, what a&s;&s;ociations have we formed, what prayers have we offered up, what animated exhortations have we given to our &s;tocks and to one another on the &s;ubject of mi&s;&s;ions? How &s;hall we exonerate our&s;elves from the enor|mous crime of which we are guilty? Shall we &s;ay, we were ignorant of our duty? The world will reclaim, How dare you teach us our duty as Chri&s;tians, while you continue &s;o gro&s;ly ignorant of your own duty as Mini&s;ters? If we plead, that we had not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered our duty, is not every man ju&s;tified in retorting, And why did you not con&s;ider it, before you entered upon the go&s;pel mini&s;try? In truth, we have no excu&s;e; and it will be&s;t become us, to blu&s;h and weep in &s;ecret pla|ces, to abhor our&s;elves, and to repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Were I ever &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed, it would hardly be in my power to exaggerate our fin and &s;hame. You know, better than I can tell you, that the ul|timate rea&s;on of any, and of all the commandments, is the will and precept of God; and that we evince the &s;ame contempt of his authority, by the wilful neglect of one clear, po&s;itive duty, as though we neglected them all. According to the &s;pirituality of the commandment we are chargeable with the perdition of all the poor Heathens whom our dili|gence might have &s;aved: and a&s;&s;uredly, their &s;ouls will the Lord require at our hands. Contra&s;t the infamy of our conduct with the grandeur of our
<PB N="14" REF="032281_0026_0FF1B1E02323AE88">calling, and the powers of language fail to give ju&s;t coloring to our &s;in!</P>
<P>Had the Apo&s;tles of our Lord, conducted them|&s;elves towards us, as we conduct our&s;elves to the Heathen world, not all the refinements of the eigh|teenth century, would have emancipated us from the wor&s;hip of Thor and Woden. But ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their religion was of a different temper. Having re|ceived the commi&s;&s;ion of their Sovereign, they declined not to engage in this warfare. Having counted the co&s;t, they entered into the combat, like men determined to conquer or to die. Confident of the &s;uperlative excellence of the cau&s;e, for which they had drawn the &s;word, they threw away the &s;cabbard, and di&s;dained capitulation with the world. The love of Chri&s;t, which we coldly talk of, they warmly felt. They had beheld his glory, were witne&s;&s;es of his holy life and ble&s;&s;ed death, his vic|tory over the grave, and his a&s;cen&s;ion to heaven. Their faith was a commanding evidence of things un&s;een, and gave a pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to things hop|ed for, they knew, emphatically, by the witne&s;s of that Spirit in their hearts, which was at once tho &s;eal of their adoption, and the earne&s;t of their inheritance, the <HI>immen&s;e grace</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. His poverty had made them rich&mdash;rich in grace, rich in faith, rich in the promi&s;e and vera|city of God who cannot lie; nor would they have bartered the&s;e riches for all the kingdoms of the world, and all their glory. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a lively hope, they purified them&s;elves as God is pure; and, enriched by the liberality of Chri&s;t, they &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and gave them to the poor, &s;eeking for them&s;elves better riches. As &s;trangers and pil|grims they expected to be hated by the world; and determining faithfully to di&s;charge the mini&s;try they had received, they knew they mu&s;t &s;uffer
<PB N="15" REF="032281_0027_0FF1B1E32DF332E8">per&s;ecution; and that men, who hated to be re|formed, would pur&s;ue to the death tho&s;e bold re|formers, who obtruded the holy light of truth, and forcibly di&s;pelled the darkne&s;s congenial to their crimes. To &s;uffer for Chri&s;t was their glory and their joy. Stripes, chains, and death were con&s;i|dered as the highe&s;t honors of the kingdom of that Je&s;us who expired on a cro&s;s; be&s;towed as the prize of valor, and the reward of exten&s;ive &s;ervices and of the mo&s;t approved integrity. Unawed by tho&s;e terrors which &s;hake our brea&s;ts, as far as rea&s;on would permit, they a&s;pired after the&s;e ho|nors; lived in hope of the crown of martyrdom; and envied the felicity of their fellows, who re|ceived it before them. The cro&s;s of Chri&s;t had crucified them to the world and the world to them. In the &s;trong light which flowed from it, they be|held poverty and riches, ea&s;e and torture, honor and infamy, life and death, with a placid mind; and the great world, and all that it contained, was contracted to a point of vanity, before the faded lu&s;tre of that eye, which wept over its &s;ins and mi&s;eries. Before that object of endle&s;s a&s;toni&s;h|ment, adoration and love, they died to them&s;elves and revived again to live to him. They were not their own but his. His blood had bought them, and his love <HI>con&s;trained</HI> them to do and &s;uffer all things for his &s;ake. They had no re&s;erves, no drawbacks on their faith; but, having given in their names to Chri&s;t, they would have judged them&s;elves worthy of the fate of Annanias and Saphira, if they defrauded him of their lives and fortunes. With them, all was &s;acred. It was their meat and drink to do the will of God, and to fini&s;h the work he had given them. The Apo&s;tles led the way and other Mini&s;ters followed, from province to province, and from kingdom to king|dom. Their King was in the mid&s;t of them, and
<PB N="16" REF="032281_0028_0FF1B1E806DAB708">they &s;aw, by faith, that &s;tandard, with that in&s;crip|tion, which was afterwards feigned to have been &s;een by the politie Con&s;tantine. The world fell before &s;uch combatants; and its pomps and vani|ties, its riches and honors, its &s;cience and learning, its arts and arms, its potentates and gods, were &s;ub|dued by the doctrine of the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>In this manner did the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians propagate their religion, being mighty, in deed and word; and, living rather than &s;peaking great things, they put to flight all the armies of the aliens. Their conque&s;ts were marked, not with the blood of their enemies, but with their own. Truth and right|eou&s;ne&s;s where their arms; and patient &s;uffering, and the doctrine of a crucified Savior, above all miraculous gifts, were the true grounds of the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s which attended their preaching. But the tide of conque&s;t was checked too &s;oon; and although, for a few centuries, &s;ome illu&s;trious names &s;upported the honor of the Chri&s;tian arms, yet the my&s;tery of iniquity, which began to work in the days of the Apo&s;tles, quickly &s;pread, with|ering the ro&s;e of the Church, &s;ubverting its faith, and corrupting its morals, until it begat a race of men more de&s;perately wicked than Heatheni&s;m ever bred, and &s;uch alone as could be produced by the <HI>Corruptions of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren, I will not now demand your attention to the melancholy de&s;olations of the Church: nor is it my intention to &s;oil, with a detail of the tran&s;|actions of a corrupt Chri&s;tianity, this letter in which I have endeavored to rou&s;e you from your &s;lumbers, by enforcing the command of Chri&s;t; and, to provoke you to emulation, by exhibiting the labors and triumphs of the fir&s;t believers. They have done greatly; and, though dead, they &s;till live and &s;peak to the followers of their faith. It is our part to record their actions, and to give
<PB N="17" REF="032281_0029_0FF1B1EB18CF93E8">them the applau&s;e they have earned &s;o well. But we mu&s;t do more. We mu&s;t tread in their &s;teps, and derive encouragement from their example. We mu&s;t <HI>prove</HI> our&s;elves their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by occu|pying the exten&s;ive field they cultivated. If we re|fu&s;e to do this, the prai&s;es we lavi&s;h on them, will be, as were the &s;epulchres built for the old pro|phets by the phari&s;aic Jews, the monuments of our hypocri&s;y and guilt. Surely, our Lord, his Apo&s;tles, his Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors, lived and di|ed not for the benefit of England nor of Chri&s;ten|dom alone.&mdash;O my God incline us to call a fa&s;t, to proclaim a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, to bathe our altars with our tears, to confe&s;s our &s;ins and treachery, to &s;ound an alarm in God's holy mountain, and to animate each other to the glorious warfare to which we are pledged!</P>
<P>The night is far &s;pent, and the day is at hand. The latter ends of the world are fallen upon us, and we have many con&s;iderations to excite us, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to more than apo&s;tolic labors. The Ea&s;t, from which the day &s;prings from on high fir&s;t v&s;ited us, has long been lo&s;t to Chri&s;t; and the cre&s;cent of Mahomet &s;till u&s;urps the places where the cro&s;s once triumphed. In the We&s;t, the Ro|man Antichri&s;t, accur&s;ed of God and man, is &s;inking under the reiterated &s;trokes of divine ven|geance. The God of the Chri&s;tians is baring his arm, and expo&s;ing the nakedne&s;s of the Scarlet Whore with whom the nations of the earth have committed &s;piritual fornication. The prayers of the &s;pirits under the altar are heard; and a righte|ous God is avenging the blood of his &s;aints, by gi|ving her to drink of the blood of her children. Yet a little while, and we &s;hall hear the cry, <HI>Babylon the Great is fallen;</HI> and &s;ee the Almighty burning her, as with fire from heaven, by the very hands which erected and &s;upported her hierarchy.
<PB N="18" REF="032281_0030_0FF1B1ECB1850468">The &s;houts of triumphant athei&s;m, and the &s;coffs of a vain philo&s;ophy invade our ears. Unheard of prodigies meet our eyes, and &s;u&s;pend our &s;ouls with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror. The &s;ame &s;pirit and principles, which have regenerated one Chri&s;tian nation to athei&s;m, are working in others, and will, probably, produce the &s;ame effect. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee kindling upon Spain, Portugal and Italy, that conflagration, which nothing but the pure &s;treams of the Reformation can extingui&s;h. Even in this ble&s;&s;ed land of civil and religious liberty, where religion has reared her mo&s;t augu&s;t temple, we have much to fear; and no human wi&s;dom can deter|mine, whether the Almighty may not purge our tin and dro&s;s, with the &s;ame fire, which con&s;umes the wood, the hay and the &s;tubble of Churches more corrupted than our own. Vain are all the admonitions of our Ma&s;ter, if we do not under|&s;tand the &s;igns of the day, and put forth tho&s;e ex|ertions to which they call us.</P>
<P>It is not for the Potentates of Europe to guaran|tee the welfare of Religion. She di&s;dains all &s;o|reign aids. She calls not for the &s;uccor, but com|mands the obedience of earthly Kings. We, the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are called upon to give the on|ly aids of which &s;he can admit; and &s;he demands our talents, our labors, our fortunes, our influ|ence, and our lives. Let us fly to the &s;uccor of our be&s;t mother, the afflicted Church of Chri&s;t. O let us no more fall out by the way. Let liberal Churchmen and con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;enters, pious Calvini&s;ts &amp; pious Arminians, embrace with frater|nal arms. Let the pre&s;s groan no longer with our controver&s;ies; and let the remembrance of the petty intere&s;ts we have contended for be buried in ever|la&s;ting oblivion. Let us vote that Mini&s;ter, who turns one &s;inner from the error of his life, a wi&s;er man than he, who demon&s;trates the being of a God;
<PB N="19" REF="032281_0031_0FF1B1EE7251D9E8">and &s;tudy to live and preach like St. Paul, rather than to &s;peak and write with Cicero.

<P>But let not our zeal, piety, and benevolence &s;top here. Let us ca&s;t our eyes upon the Continent. Let us extend our views to the ends of the earth. Let us, henceforth, con&s;ider it as our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to do all that lies in our power, to preach the go&s;pel to <HI>every creature.</HI> Let Mi&s;&s;ions be treated no more with cold neglect, or be vilified with charges of enthu&s;ia&s;m.

<HEAD>THIRD LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter, I made free to put the que&s;tion. <HI>What monies have to &s;ub&s;cribed, what a&s;&s;ocia|tions have we formed, what prayers have we offer|ed up, what animated exhortations have we given to our &s;tocks, and to one another, on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;&s;ions?</HI> In reply, I &s;hall be told, that the Church of England has long e&s;tabli&s;hed a Society for foreign Mi&s;&s;ions; that the Unitas Fratrum have done worthily in the cau&s;e; that the We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lean Methodi&s;ts have had, of late years, great &s;ucce&s;s in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; that the Particular Bap|ti&s;ts have taken up the matter with &s;pirit; that Elliott, Brainard and others have acquired immor|tality by their labors among the North American Indians; that the Danes and Hollanders have their Mi&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t; and, that the Je&s;uits, and other religious Orders of the Roman Communion, have &s;hed much blood for Chri&s;t, in South Ameri|ca, China, and Japan.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e tran&s;actions I am not altogether igno|rant. God forbid I &s;hould depreciate their worth! The benevolent promoters of Mi&s;&s;ions merit my warme&s;t prai&s;e; and the mi&s;&s;ionaries, who have acted up to the &s;pirit of their engagements, are &s;uperior to all human approbation. Their record is on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh, and they will &s;hine, as the &s;un in the firmament, for ever and ever. Con&s;idered in the ab&s;tract, what has been done de&s;erves the highe&s;t commendation. But whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we reflect on the &s;ub|ject, in all its extent, we mu&s;t &s;ee our labors in a very diminutive point of view. Were our Pro|phet the bloody Mahomet, were our religion a
<PB N="22" REF="032281_0034_0FF1B1F9A3A98FF8">mere moral &s;y&s;tem, were its &s;anctions of le&s;s con&s;i|deration than they are, were our own &s;incerity and the welfare of the world not connected &s;o intimate|ly as they are, in the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, I would celebrate our good deeds in the mo&s;t jubi|lant &s;trains. But, when I look on the myriads of men who <HI>lie in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death;</HI> when heaven and hell open on my &s;oul, and ca&s;t their light upon our labors; or when I &s;tand by the &s;ide of the &s;uffering Savior of the Heathen, and my bible tells me, that He whom I &s;ee expiring in agony, is GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, &s;hame, grief, and indignation oppre&s;s my feelings. I ca&s;t up the &s;um of our labors, and, amid&s;t &s;uch objects, mark it with a cypher. Alas! it is evident, we are &s;till in the infancy of things; and that the mi&s;&s;ionary &s;pirit has not yet warmed the bo&s;om of the Church. Contemplate the&s;e objects, Reverend Brethern, which I have &s;et before you; and &s;ay, Whether I can with truth and mode&s;ty compliment you on our atchievements? Or can merit cen&s;ure, for repeating the que&s;tion, What monies have we &s;ub&s;cribed, what a&s;&s;ociations have we formed, what prayers have we offered up, what animated exhor|tations have we given to our flocks and to one ano|ther on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;&s;ions? Greenland is, per|haps the only Heathen Country, in which the ge|nuine religion of Chri&s;t has gained a <HI>firm</HI> footing for &s;everal centuries.</P>
<P>Neither a hi&s;tory of Mi&s;&s;ions, nor even a re|view of them, can have place in the narrow limits of my plan. A few ob&s;ervations on the views, with which they have been &s;et on foot; the man|ner, in which they have been conducted; and the &s;ucce&s;s, which has attended them, is all that I &s;hall offer to your attention in this letter.</P>
<P>Mi&s;&s;ions have &s;ometimes been &s;et on foot with very improper views. Such were the Mi&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="23" REF="032281_0035_0FF1B1FF94BB9630">the Je&s;uits in Paraguay, California, and other parts of Spani&s;h America. Their end was the &s;ubjuga|tion of the poor &s;avages to the dominion of Spain; and Chri&s;tianity was a mere &s;tate engine, by which it was hoped the minds of freemen might with more facility, be bowed to the yoke of &s;lavery. Whether tho&s;e good Fathers were more hone&s;t than their employers, and were really de&s;irous to con&s;ult the happine&s;s of their converts, or were &s;timulated only by ambitious and lucrative motives, as they &s;tand charged by their enemies, I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay. But we know well what was the end of tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ions. In one day, all the Je&s;uits in South America were &s;eized, their Order aboli&s;hed, and the ultima ratio regum&mdash;cannon and mu&s;kets, ap|plied with &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s to the mi&s;erable Gua|ranis, that, if they were not made good Chri&s;ti|ans, they were, at lea&s;t, converted into what the Court of Spain had much more at heart&mdash;pa&s;&s;ive, &s;piritle&s;s &s;laves. The Mi&s;&s;ions among the Canadi|an Indians, while that country made a part of the French dominions, appear to have originated in &s;i|milar motives. Happily, their cata&s;trophe was le&s;s bloody. The mi&s;&s;ionaries, indeed, fell by the hands of the untractable &s;avages they would have converted to &s;lavery and chri&s;tianized &s;uper&s;tition. They them&s;elves &s;till remain to be exterminated, as tribes of their brethern have been, by the Eng|li&s;h bayonet and American riflemen. The Mi&s;&s;ions of the Portugue&s;e in Angola, Aby&s;&s;inia, and India, had very different things in view than the &s;alvation of men's &s;ouls. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, I fear, of many other Catholic Mi&s;&s;ions. In this re&s;pect, Prote&s;tants are not &s;o blameable: neverthele&s;s, we are not, altogether, without having been actuated by unworthy views. Prote&s;tant powers have not made religion the pretext for conque&s;t; for they have, in general, valued it &s;o little, that provided
<PB N="24" REF="032281_0036_0FF1B2011D86BF10">they might carry on their commerce in peace, and cut the throats of the Heathens, whenever they re|&s;i&s;ted their encroachments, they have left them to take care of their own &s;ouls; as if it was thought Chri&s;tianity could do them no good, and the injuri|es they &s;uffered from us merited no compen&s;ation. But, to quicken the &s;low movements of piety, even among Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants, &s;ome patrons of Mi&s;&s;ions have not di&s;dained to apply the &s;timulus of intere&s;t. Mi&s;&s;ions would civilize the &s;avage&mdash;He would &s;oon be taught to value European luxuries &mdash;Furs would purcha&s;e our coar&s;e goods. Thus were Mi&s;&s;ions connected with manufactures and commerce, and gain became a pede&s;tal for godline&s;s to &s;tand upon. If this mode of rea&s;oning be thought allowable with tho&s;e, who are not to be influenced by more appropriate motives, I affirm, from certain knowlege, that it brings a &s;lur on all undertakings of the kind. I add, that if &s;uch an argument &s;hould engage men of improper cha|racters to act in a&s;&s;ociations for Mi&s;&s;ions, and to have any weight in the conduct of them, Mi&s;&s;ions will &s;uffer more injury from their coun&s;els, than they can derive benefit from their liberality. The giving <HI>glory to God in the highe&s;t,</HI> and the &s;pread|ing of <HI>peace and good will among men upon earth</HI> are the only motives, which &s;hould influence the&s;e attempts; and, if we think to promote the cau&s;e of God, by arguments addre&s;&s;ed to the corrupt princi|ples of man, we &s;hall cut off our legs, before we &s;et out in the race.</P>
<P>The manner, in which Mi&s;&s;ions have been con|ducted, has been as different, as the views i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which they originated, and the characters of tho&s;e who acted in them.</P>
<P>In South America, the ambition and avarice of the Je&s;uits, or their piety (God knows which) were &s;ub&s;ervient to the politics of the Court of
<PB N="25" REF="032281_0037_0FF1B202C55E0600">Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id; and this co-operation, &s;o long as it conti|nued, gave an a&s;toni&s;hing momentum to their la|bors. The Pope, the King of Spain, and zealous Catholics enriched their funds; and, that the im|moral lives of the Spaniards might not perjudice the Indians again&s;t the faith of Chri&s;t, they were prohibited from any intercour&s;e with the Nations, who were to be converted. The Je&s;uits, on their part, embarked in the undertaking in great num|bers. They conducted the enterprize with wi&s;dom, courage, and per&s;everance, Many of them were the victims of their zeal; falling by the hands of the Indians, or in con&s;equence of the hard&s;hips they endured. The members of that learned Order were metamorphi&s;ed into ma&s;ons, carpenters, and &s;miths, and at once, in&s;tructed their converts in the arts of life and in the truths of religion, They prevailed; and collected the wandering tribes into villages, where they appear to have lived happy under their lenient government. But the que&s;tion was, Whom the&s;e poor creatures &s;hould acknow|lege for their ma&s;ter, the Je&s;uits, or the King of Spain? Hence tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, which termina|ted in the ruin of the Mi&s;&s;ions, and the abolition of the Order of Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>In Japan and China, we have memorable docu|ments of the prowe&s;s of that celebrated Order. Francis Xavier was him&s;elf a ho&s;t. His labors were wonderful; and through every unhappy me|dium that we are to contemplate his character, he appears a man of the fir&s;t magnitude. An eulo|gium, &s;uperior to the que&s;tionable miracles, with which his biographers adorn his life, may be col|lected from the reverence in which he was held by the Japane&s;e, and the hatred with which he was per&s;ecu|ted by his companions from Portugal. He &s;eems to have been too good for their purpo&s;es. The men, who have &s;ince borne witne&s;s to his worth, were
<PB N="26" REF="032281_0038_0FF1B20768D87B60">tho&s;e on whom his death is chargeable. It is well known, that this Apo&s;tle of the Indies expired in the I&s;land of Sanchian, de&s;erted by all his country|men, at the time he was endeavoring to penetrate into China.&mdash;But the indefatigable Sons of Loyala &s;oon trod in the &s;teps of this famous leader. After &s;urmounting innumerable ob&s;tacles, which were thrown in their way from the policy of the Chi|ne&s;e, and the contempt and jealou&s;y in which they held Europeans, they &s;ound means to recommend them&s;elves to the Emperor and the Mandarins of his Court; and obtained many privileges and in|dulgencies for their Order. Their &s;kill in the Ma|thematics, A&s;tronomy, and other &s;ciences, and their elegant and expen&s;ive pre&s;ents of curious pie|ces of mechani&s;m, gave them great influence in a kingdom, who&s;e Monarchs have given the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed patronage to men of letters and &s;ci|ence. Their converts in Japan and China &s;oon amounted to &s;everal hundred thou&s;ands; numerous churches were built; books of religion were tran&s;|lated into the native languages; and their affair wore an a&s;pect, &s;o favorable, as to promi&s;e a per|manent and exten&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Roman religion, in both tho&s;e empires. But the Mi&s;&s;ionaries them&s;elves &s;apped the foundations of the fab|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie they had erected. Intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s, they affected too much notoriety. Laying a&s;ide that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y which had at fir&s;t recommended them to notice, they betrayed a lofty and imperious &s;pirit. They &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;avor of the Sovereign the be&s;t &s;ecurity for their labors; and &s;oon became accom|pli&s;hed courtiers. The nobility, offended at the intere&s;t which a few ob&s;cure &s;trangers had acquired with the Prince, united to de&s;troy them. The Dominicans, who had been a&s;&s;ociated in their la|bors, quarrelled with the Je&s;uits; and their mutu|al ill offices rendered the Emperor &s;u&s;picious of
<PB N="27" REF="032281_0039_0FF1B20A74A21730">the con&s;equences of introducing the papal power over the con&s;ciences of his &s;ubjects. Per&s;ecution l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wered. Bani&s;hment, impri&s;onment, and death &s;oon followed. Great numbers of the Je&s;uits and of their converts &s;uffered with invincible fortitude; and, in their la&s;t moments, approved a hope full of immortality. Chri&s;tianity may be con&s;idered as exterminated in both tho&s;e great Empires; ex|cept, that in the la&s;t, a few di&s;gui&s;ed prie&s;ts &s;till find means to conceal them&s;elves in Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, to keep alive the dying embers of the mighty flame they had kindled. The Je&s;uits &s;tand convicted of grant|ing to their pro&s;elytes large indulgence of hea|theni&s;h &s;uper&s;tition; but I &s;ee not why Prote&s;tants &s;hould be <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI> at their conduct, and much le&s;s, why Papi&s;ts &s;hould <HI>criminate</HI> it. Men, who offer|ed &s;aint wor&s;hip to that Moloch, Dominick, and other illu&s;trious villains of the papal calendar, could not deal rigorou&s;ly with the Chine&s;e, for &s;i|milar honors they paid to the benevolent Confuci|us and the &s;pirits of their progenitors. Nor do I &s;ee, why we &s;hould think &s;o meanly of their con|verts. Thou&s;ands of them died for their religion and if, amid&s;t all the trumpery of antichri&s;tian &s;u|per&s;tition, we can di&s;cover &s;pirits &s;o pure and ele|vated as tho&s;e of a Fenelon and Pa&s;chal, I think there is great rea&s;on to believe, that the command|ing features of revealed religion, rendered doubly impre&s;&s;ive from their novelty, might produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects on the converts of China and Japan.</P>
<P>Of the attempts which have been made by the Society for Foreign Mi&s;&s;ions, I wi&s;h to &s;peak in hand&s;ome terms. But, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that there is nothing on the face of the accounts of their proceedings, which have been laid, from time to time, before the Public, upon which I can ground a compliment. Their money and their labors have
<PB N="28" REF="032281_0040_0FF1B20C40386968">been extremely unproductive; and, I fear very lit|tle is to be expected from that quarter, until a con|&s;iderable alteration takes place in the &s;pirit of the Church of England, and in the manner in which her mi&s;&s;ions are conducted. We &s;eem almo&s;t de&s;|titute of the zeal and courage required for the&s;e en|gagements. I believe the Society are frequently at a lo&s;s to find mi&s;&s;ionaries; and, under this di&s;|couragement, are often obliged to take up with improper characters. We have no di&s;cipline. We have no common habits to unite our mi&s;&s;ionaries. They are thinly &s;cattered in Mi&s;&s;ions, and not en|joying the advantages of numbers equal to their at|tempts, nor acting with united &s;trength and coun|&s;els, they cannot have great &s;ucce&s;s. Let cau&s;e and effect be compared together, and it will appear that the&s;e attempts have been as fruitful, as was to be expected from the manner in which they were conducted. The Society in Scotland for propagat|ing Chri&s;tian Knowlege have de&s;erved well of their country; and have made many attempts to convert and civilize the North-American Savages. Some of their mi&s;&s;ionaries have been apo&s;tolic men, and God has ble&s;&s;ed their labors with con&s;iderable &s;uc|ce&s;s. They have evinced a true &s;pirit of Mi&s;&s;ions, by expo&s;ing their per&s;ons to all the dangers and hard&s;hips of living among &s;avages. If this Society has erred in any thing, it is in expo&s;ing the&s;e ex|cellent men &s;ingly and alone, to contend with all the di&s;couragements of &s;uch undertakings. This mu&s;t have thrown a great damp on their activity, depre&s;|&s;ing their &s;pirits, injuring their health, and accele|rating their death. No human mind can at all times &s;upport it&s;elf under diver&s;ified &s;uffering and di&s;appointment. If any man on earth needs the &s;upport of a few kindred &s;pirits to cheer his heart, invigorate his zeal and &s;upport his patience and for|titude, it is a mi&s;&s;ionary to Heathens. David Brai|nerd,
<PB N="29" REF="032281_0041_0FF1B20F58D14968">and a few &s;uperior minds, may have walked through life, without the con&s;olation of a friend and comforter. But the conver&s;ion of Heathens will never be effected by a few &s;uch characters. Com|mon men mu&s;t be employed, and Mi&s;&s;ions, to be &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t be rendered, as much as po&s;&s;ible, common things. Perhaps, we are hardly ju&s;tifia|ble in expo&s;ing in&s;ulated individuals in &s;uch circum|&s;tances of trial; and let them an&s;wer our expecta|tions ever &s;o well, their &s;ucce&s;s will always be in|adequate to the object of Mi&s;&s;ions, which is an ex|ten&s;ive &s;pread of Chri&s;t's religion. I know not that the Dutch have merited commendation by their mi&s;&s;ionary labors. I am equally ignorant of what has been done by the Swedes. The Danes are entitled to the approbation of their fellow Chri&s;tians for their labors of love in Greenland and in the Ea&s;t; but as I can &s;peak of them only in general terms, and my principal intention is to confine my ob&s;ervations to what has been done among our&s;elves, I dare form no e&s;timate of their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The Moravian Brethren, have been among us, what the Je&s;uits were in the Roman Church. They have labored, and &s;uffered, and effected <HI>more than all of us.</HI> Their motives have been pure; their mi&s;&s;ionaries unblameable; their &s;elf denial, courage, hardihood and per&s;everance admirable; and their &s;ucce&s;s &s;uch as to give general encouragement. They have never provoked per&s;ecution among the Heathens, nor incurred reproach among Europe|ans, by a &s;ecular, &s;ordid, turbulent &s;pirit. Their &s;ucce&s;s cannot be referred to the learning of their Mini&s;ters, the richne&s;s of their funds, or the names and influence of great patrons. The ca&s;e was for otherwi&s;e: in all the&s;e re&s;pects they have lain under heavy di&s;couragements. We mu&s;t then account for their &s;ucce&s;s upon other principles;
<PB N="30" REF="032281_0042_0FF1B2125FDD3618">and they are, I think, very obvious. Their mi&s;|&s;ionaries have been men of ardent piety. The Brethren had it in their power to hold out no im|proper inducements to them. They are all of them volunteers; for it is an inviolable maxim, with the Moravians, to <HI>per&s;uade</HI> no man to engage in mi&s;&s;i|ons. They &s;eldom make an attempt where there are not half a dozen of them in the Mi&s;&s;ion. They live together in one family, and, where they find it nece&s;&s;ary, labor with their own hands. Hence their Mi&s;&s;ions are le&s;s expen&s;ive, than tho&s;e of any other people; they can engage in more Mi&s;&s;ions, than they would otherwi&s;e be able to &s;upport; and their mi&s;&s;ionaries are enabled to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, where tho&s;e of other denominations would &s;tarve. Their mi&s;&s;i|onaries are entirely of one mind, as to the doc|trines they teach, their mode of inculcating them, and the di&s;cipline they exerci&s;e over their flocks. Their habits are congenial; and, accu&s;tomed for a cour&s;e of years to give &s;crupulous attention to every rule of their Church, few ca&s;es can occur to produce diver&s;ity of judgments among them. They live together with the regularity of a mona&s;tic in&s;titu|tion; and the frequent &s;tated returns of devotional exerci&s;es keep up the &s;pirit of piety. They have each of them their proper department in the family, and occupied as they are, with &s;tudy, private and public devotion, preaching, and the various exerci|&s;es of the pa&s;toral care, they have no time to be idle. If any of their mi&s;&s;ionaries are carried off by &s;ick|ne&s;s or ca&s;uality, men of the &s;ame &s;tamp are ready to &s;upply their place; and the office of a mi&s;&s;ionary does not go about knocking at a hundred door; doomed to be rejected by them all, as too often hap|pens in the Church of England Mi&s;&s;ions. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> mutually &s;upporting and in&s;piring one another, they are &s;heltered from tho&s;e tempe&s;ts, which di&s;charge their fury on a few &s;olitary beings, badly united
<PB N="31" REF="032281_0043_0FF1B2184D9A6430">together, and placed in circum&s;tances, where the zeal and abilities of an individual, however great, can effect little.</P>
<P>The Methodi&s;ts have lately entered upon this ca|reer, and bid fair to run it with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. The character of their mini&s;ters, the nature of their di&s;cipline, and the integrity of their views, are &s;i|milar, in many re&s;pects, to tho&s;e of the Moravi|ans. But there are al&s;o &s;ome features, in which they are &s;trongly contra&s;ted; and they will, pro|bably, produce a con&s;iderable difference in the na|ture and &s;ucce&s;s of their mi&s;&s;ionary warfare, both of a favorable and unfavorable kind. The zeal o the Moravian is calm, &s;teady, per&s;evering. He would reform the world, but is careful how he quarrels with it. He carries his point by addre&s;s, and the in&s;inuations of mode&s;ty and mildne&s;s, which commend them&s;elves to all men, and give offence to none. The habits of &s;ilence, quietne&s;s, and de|cent re&s;erve, mark his character. The zeal of the Methodi&s;t blazes, and burns every thing before it. He is open, active, bold, and ardent. He &s;ees him&s;elf in a pu&s;hing world, and pu&s;hes with the foremo&s;t. He cannot brook the general coldne&s;s; and, fearle&s;s of con&s;eque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces, cen&s;ures with &s;eve|rity what he deems cen&s;urable. He mixes in the world; makes a hundred different attempts to ef|fect his purpo&s;e; and, if ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in them all, di|rects his labors to &s;ome other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt, which affords full &s;cope to his activity. He lives in action; and is dejected and uncomfortable, if he wants active employment. The Methodi&s;ts are know chiefly for what they have done at home; the Moravians for what they have done abroad. The Moravian di&s;cipline is more &s;evere and complicate, and re|quires a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and docility in their people, again which the high idea of per&s;onal liberty that prevails in Europe, &s;trongly militates. The
<PB N="32" REF="032281_0044_0FF1B219D6AB8338">Methodi&s;t di&s;cipline is more lax and liberal: and while it is &s;ufficiently &s;trict, in guarding men's, morals, it carries nothing in it to repel pro&s;elytes. Itinerancy is the Palladium of Methodi&s;m. Fix|ing on &s;ome favorable po&s;t, they revolve in a circle round it, perpetually making incur&s;ions in the neighboring country, and multiplying their cir|cuits and their preachers in proportion to their &s;uc|ce&s;s. If they do not &s;plit of them&s;elves, their is hardly any thing in the mi&s;&s;ionary line, which they may not attempt and &s;ucceed in. But they will not. I fear, be able to &s;teer clear of per&s;ecution, as the Moravians have done; nor do I conceive, that they have patience and per&s;everence for a Greenland Mi&s;&s;ion. A Methodi&s;t preacher would think his life thrown away, in &s;pending twenty or thirty years upon a few converts. And, I &s;tarter my&s;elf, the Methodi&s;ts are too well acquainted with them|&s;elves, to engage in &s;uch undertakings, while &s;o many large and populous kingdoms are acce&s;&s;ible to their labors.</P>
<P>When we come to make a general e&s;timate of the &s;ucce&s;s of Mi&s;&s;ions, both in the Roman and Prote&s;tant Communions, I fear, I &s;hould be too li|beral were I to &s;ay, that there are in the whole Hea|then world, one hundred thou&s;and <HI>genuine</HI> converts to Chri&s;tianity. And, if this be all we can &s;hew for our labor, from the Reformation of Luther to the pre&s;ent day, I think it invincible demon&s;tration, that we have not taken up the matter with a proper &s;pirit, nor conducted it in a proper manner.</P>
<P>From the foregoing ob&s;ervations, I come to the following conclu&s;ions. Fir&s;t, that if we continue to go on with Mi&s;&s;ions as we have done, we can hope for no better &s;ucce&s;s; and the day of judg|ment will &s;urprize us quarrelling with each other in Europe, where we have earthly intere&s;ts to en|gage our pa&s;&s;ions, and doing nothing in the re&s;t of the
<PB N="33" REF="032281_0045_0FF1B21B5F86DCA0">world, where all the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t are neglect|ed. Secondly, it will be more manly and ingenu|ous to renounce all our Mi&s;&s;ions, to deny the obli|gation of acting in them, and to acknowledge that we are mercenaries, who mu&s;t be paid for our pa|ter no&s;ter, than thus to go on &s;hamefully deceiving our&s;elves, and endeavoring to impo&s;e on God and men, by a &s;hew of zeal for religion, which has no real place in our hearts and conduct. Thirdly, mi&s;&s;ionaries mu&s;t be united perfectly, in common principles and habits, and act with that energy which re&s;ults from u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ited coun&s;els and actions; and, it is with the view of &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of it, that I have expatiated &s;o freely on the Je&s;uits, Moravians, and Methodi&s;ts. Fourthly, mi&s;&s;iona|ries mu&s;t be &s;ound in larger numbers, and &s;uitable funds mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the work. An en|quiry into the be&s;t way of conducting Mi&s;&s;ions, and the con&s;ideration of what &s;teps it is incumbent on us to take in this bu&s;ine&s;s, will furni&s;h matter for my next Letter.</P>

<HEAD>FOURTH LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN writing upon Mi&s;&s;ions, I propo&s;ed only to call general attention to the &s;ubject, and to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with a few hints on the manner of conduct|ing them. But, at the reque&s;t of &s;ome friends, whom I have con&s;ulted, and to who&s;e judgment I owe much deference. I am now prevailed upon to &s;ay, <HI>&s;pecifically,</HI> what is it I expect from my Bre|thren in the mini&s;try re&s;pecting Mi&s;&s;ions; and to obtrude my own particular views of the mo&s;t eligi|ble way of carrying them into effect.</P>
<P>Of you, Reverend Brethren, I require, that you will &s;et to heart the &s;alvation of the Heathen, me|ditate on the &s;ubject with the mo&s;t &s;olemn and affec|tionate feelings, and cultivate your zeal and phi|lanthropy by earne&s;t prayer to God, that he would give you towards them bowels and mercies. I would have you &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that it may be your duty to take a more active part in Mi&s;&s;ions than you have imagined; and con&s;equently, I with you to dive&s;t your&s;elves of every prejudice which might bias your judgment, and preclude the convictions of duty. I expect, that you will not treat the &s;ubject with levity, and, much le&s;s with contempt; but &s;peak of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with re&s;pect and appro|bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n. I think, you &s;hould take opportunities of &s;etting the importance of the&s;e undertaking, before your flocks from the pulpit; and, by your exhor|tations and liberality, give them examples of zeal and benevolence. I add, that if your convictions of duty lead that way, you &s;hould come forward with all boldne&s;s, and take your p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="35" REF="032281_0047_0FF1B2203B12D168">and take your part in the bu&s;ine&s;s, whatever it may be, in &s;erving Mi&s;&s;ions, by your pen, your influence, your advice, or your per&s;onal labors, ei|ther at home or abroad.</P>
<P>From Mini&s;ters, as connected with each other, I expect, that they mutually communicate their views as to the mo&s;t effectual methods of &s;preading the go&s;pel, and exhort each other to a generous and noble exertion of mini&s;terial zeal. I require them to form A&s;&s;ociations, for collecting money, obtain|ing information, procuring mi&s;&s;ionaries, and tran&s;|acting the variety of concerns, which fall under the con&s;ideration of Mi&s;&s;ions. In the&s;e A&s;&s;ocia|tions, I wi&s;h tho&s;e Mini&s;ters to come forward, who&s;e character and &s;ervices give them mo&s;t re&s;pec|tability, and will enable them to promote effectual|ly the cau&s;e they undertake. La&s;t of all, having once engaged, I would have the A&s;&s;ociation to be actuated by <HI>a true &s;pirit</HI> of Mi&s;&s;ions. They &s;hould be zealous, active, indefatigable. Any Mini&s;ter who is not warmly affected to Mi&s;&s;ions, &s;hould be excluded from the acting Committee. What the&s;e Gentlemen are, their mi&s;&s;ions will be. Having in their power the choice of mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the management of the Mi&s;&s;ion, they will not fail to give to the whole undertaking the features and complexion of their own characters.&mdash;This is the &s;um of my requi&s;itions; and I &s;latter my&s;elf that there is in it, nothing irrational, nothing, to the performance of which our calling does not oblige us.</P>
<P>The &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s which has attended Mi&s;&s;ions &s;hould incline us to &s;u&s;pect, that they have not been conducted in the mo&s;t eligible way; and di&s;po&s;e us to examine with candor any new method, which may be propo&s;ed. I will, therefore, &s;hew my opi|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. But as I do not pre&s;ume to dictate to any man on the &s;ubject; &s;o I am aware that no one
<PB N="36" REF="032281_0048_0FF1B2264A95B398">plan can be formed, which will equally apply to Nations, who differ in their degree of civilivation, their police, their religion, and the face of their country. Whoever, therefore, are intru&s;ted with the execution of our plans, &s;hould have the di&s;cre|tionary power, of deviating in their application, as the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e &s;hall demand. This ob|&s;ervation premi&s;ed, a general view of the nature of Mi&s;&s;ions, and of the &s;tate of the Heathen Nations, may enable us to infer &s;omething as to the line of conduct mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Before we can ju&s;tify &s;anguine hopes, a con&s;ide|rable alteration in favor of religion mu&s;t take place among our&s;elves. We cannot give to others, what we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s; and before our zeal will acquire &s;ufficient momentum to effect great things for the &s;alvation of the Heathens, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a more general and &s;erious care &s;hould prevail about the &s;alvation of our own &s;ouls. While we look for this de&s;irable change, we cannot do better than re|new our mi&s;&s;ionary engagements; which will have the mo&s;t favorable operation in bringing it about. Great de&s;igns and great undertakings form great men. They call forth the talents, of which we never &s;uppo&s;ed our&s;elves to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and give an exhibition of &s;plendid virtues, which do not fre|quent the common paths of life. Courage pro|vokes c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rage, and zeal enkindles zeal. Con&s;ide|rable &s;ucce&s;s, in any one mi&s;&s;ion, would encourage many undertakings; and the activity exerted in fa|vor of the Heathens, would naturally call atten|tion to the ways and means of doing good among our own countrymen.</P>
<P>Want of &s;ucce&s;s is the mo&s;t fatal objection which lies again&s;t Mi&s;&s;ions. We have not taken proper &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. We have hardly dared to <HI>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> for it. A few hundred converts have been con&s;idered, as a great thing; and a &s;ew thou&s;and
<PB N="37" REF="032281_0049_0FF1B229565B34A0">have been the he plus ultra of our hope. A revo|lution mu&s;t take place in our id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as on the &s;ubject. We mu&s;t hope for great things. We mu&s;t attempt great things. Until this is done, <HI>tolerable &s;ucce&s;s</HI> is not to be expected. There is a proportion be|tween the object we embrace, and the zeal and ex|ertion we &s;how in accompli&s;hing it. Such limited views as the&s;e preclude exertion. Whereas, where great advantages are propo&s;ed, men are forward to incur great expences, and to run great ri&s;ks. Let us, then, determine to give a fair trial to Mi&s;&s;ions, and undertake &s;omething which will help us to form a rea&s;onable judgment of what is, or is not to be expected from them. Let our object be to evan|gelize the I&s;lands of the South Sea, or to obtain for Chri&s;tianity <HI>a firm footing</HI> and <HI>exten&s;ive &s;pread</HI> in India, China, Tibet, Borneo, Per&s;ia, Tartary, and other great kingdoms.</P>
<P>The preparations we make mu&s;t be an&s;werable to the views we adopt. Men and money are the nerves of war. A few &s;cattered mi&s;&s;ionaries, and paltry funds, are inadequate to &s;uch conque&s;ts. But, as our &s;trength is &s;mall, and our forces new levies, unpracti&s;ed to the&s;e perilous encounters, I would recommend to no Denomination of Chri&s;tians to engage in a &s;econd Mi&s;&s;ion, until experience has convinced them that they are more than equal to the fir&s;t. We mu&s;t al&s;o be re&s;olved to take the field in the very bolde&s;t line of &s;ervice. A Mi&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially &s;uch a Mi&s;&s;ion as I propo&s;e, is one of tho&s;e enterprizes where the mea&s;ures which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear the mo&s;t hazardous and de&s;pe|rate, are the mo&s;t deliberate and &s;ucce&s;sful. Men, who are not di&s;po&s;ed to run all chances, and to undergo &s;ufferings, which on the relation might freeze the blood of tho&s;e who hear them quietly by their fire &s;ides, have no bu&s;ine&s;s in Mi&s;&s;ions. And, if mi&s;&s;ionaries of this ca&s;t are not to be bad, we
<PB N="38" REF="032281_0050_0FF1B22B2424F5D0">may, without any great detriment to the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, wait with patience until &s;uch characters ap|pear in the world. Men of other di&s;po&s;itions will do, as little as has been done: and if a few indivi|duals of a peculiar turn of mind are willing to re|linqui&s;h a large &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s in Europe for the hope of converting a handful of people in In|dia, they will not have many followers: But they will furni&s;h for us, at home, a pretext for talking about greater things, than we have godline&s;s or courage to perform.</P>
<P>I give my advice that no Mi&s;&s;ion, of the de&s;|cription I have pointed out, be undertaken with a &s;maller number than ten or twelve mi&s;&s;ionaries; and that number &s;hould be increa&s;ed in a treble or quadru|ple proportion, as the &s;ucce&s;s attending the Mi&s;&s;ion may require. To procure a large &s;upply of mi&s;&s;i|onaries, I propo&s;e that an equal number of pious lay brethren &s;hould be employed in every Mi&s;&s;ion, as &s;choolma&s;ters, tran&s;cribers, exhorters, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in all the emergencies of the Mi&s;&s;ion, to which mi&s;&s;ionaries may not be able to give attention. Young men of twenty, or one and twenty years of age would ea&s;ily be found among every Chri&s;tian people, who have good natural talents and zeal for God, which would make them rejoice to be a&s;&s;ocia|ted in our labors. Their youth and inexperience would derive in&s;truction and &s;upport from their el|der Brethren, and, after a few years trial, they might be promoted to the honorable &s;tation of mi&s;|&s;ionaries. Such an e&s;tabli&s;hment would be the be&s;t &s;eminary of education for mi&s;&s;ions, and, with oc|ca&s;ional helps from Europe, be &s;ufficient for all de|mands. Nor is this idea, altogether novel: the Unitas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ratum, in their Mi&s;&s;ions, have availed them&s;elves greatly of the piety of their lay bre|thren.</P>
<P>As the expence of &s;upporting &s;o large a number
<PB N="39" REF="032281_0051_0FF1B22FC68FB000">of mi&s;&s;ionaries would be very great, and far be|yond the &s;trength of any funds, which can, at this time, be &s;et on foot, I propo&s;e that no mi&s;&s;ionary be received until he has acquainted him|&s;elf with one or other art, by which he may do &s;omething towards his own maintenance. This is, I think, a matter of indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity. The Apo&s;tles of our Lord, the Je&s;uits, and the Mora|vians, have experienced the advantage of practi|&s;ing the&s;e hone&s;t arts. I have el&s;ewhere given my rea&s;ons for di&s;charging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arried mini&s;ters from this warfare; neverthele&s;s, if &s;uch are to be found, as are de&s;irous of engaging under all the di&s;courage|ments of their &s;ituation, let them go. With God's ble&s;&s;ing, both they and their wives may be very u&s;eful in a mi&s;&s;ionary family.</P>
<P>With &s;uch difficulties and dangers before them, it would be ungenerous and unfeeling not to give to mi&s;&s;ionaries every comfort and accommodation we can afford; but a &s;tated &s;alary is, in my idea of it, unnece&s;&s;ary and improper. A few books, and clothes, with the proper implements of their re&s;pective arts, is all they can need, and all they could retain with &s;afety in an uncivilized country.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e twenty mi&s;&s;ionaries and lay-brethren &s;afely landed in Otaheite, they mu&s;t recommend them&s;elves by liberality, and purcha&s;e a few acres of land for cultivation, as well as a competent &s;tock of the nece&s;&s;aries of the country. They will build a large hou&s;e for their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and erect a church for divine wor&s;hip. After they begin to be acquainted with the people and country, they may, if it be thought advi&s;able, make two or three more e&s;tabli&s;hments in different parts of the I&s;land. They will form vocabularies, and reduce the lan|guage to rule; make ob&s;ervation on all they &s;ee and hear, write it down, and commit it to memo|ry; they will acquaint them&s;elves with the religi|on,

During this time they may al&s;o give the natives &s;ome hi&s;torical accounts of Chri&s;tianity, and the leading principles of our morals. But their grand labor will be the acquisition of the language, and the improvement of their piety, as well as the gi|ving of an example to the i&s;landers, by the regular and frequent returns of all the exerci&s;es of piety and benevolence. In two years time I &s;uppo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tolerably well acquainted with the language, and tho&s;e who &s;peak it, their affairs in good train, and the plan of operation laid down with mutual con|&s;ent. They may now proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, and open their commi&s;&s;ion with due &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>If they did not before multiply their e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, it will now be nece&s;&s;ary to do it. In each department, they will open a &s;chool for <HI>youth,</HI> ra|ther than children; and others of them may be employed in travelling through the country in a re|gular itinerancy, preaching every night and morn|ing; and after a circuit of a fortnight, return to the e&s;tabli&s;hment. And in this manner mu&s;t they continue to act, increa&s;ing their labor in pro|portion to their &s;ucce&s;s, and to their numbers. If, in&s;tead of Otaheite, they make their attempt in India, they may conduct them&s;elves in much the &s;ame way. It may be needful to &s;ay that they &s;hould form their e&s;tabli&s;hments in all the great cities of the empire, after the example of the Apo&s;tles, who &s;oon formed Churches in Alexandria, Anti|och, and Rome.</P>
<P>In mi&s;&s;ionary e&s;tabli&s;hments, the greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken in giving to every man his proper department, and in pre&s;erving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> general co-operation in all their efforts. If ab&s;olute ruin be not the

If there be any conclu&s;ivene&s;s in this rea&s;on|ing, it will &s;hew the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of each mi&s;&s;ionary's guarding again&s;t pertinacity of opinion, and the encouraging of tho&s;e habits of fa&s;tidious delicacy which grow upon men who are accu&s;tom|ed in all things to con&s;ult only their private feel|ings.&mdash;Unle&s;s we can re&s;olve on this &s;acrifice, we are not qualified to act in Mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Under the con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t eligible way of conducting Mi&s;&s;ions, it may not be improper to add a few ob&s;ervations on the manner of preaching, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d the behavior with re&s;pect to &s;ome important points which will be mo&s;t likely to give &s;ucce&s;s to mi&s;&s;ionaries. His doctrine and the way of propo|&s;ing it are the fir&s;t things I &s;hall notice. He &s;hould remember, that he is a preacher of the go&s;pel, and that it is not &s;o much moral truths, as go&s;pel prin|ciples and motives that he is to in&s;til into his audi|tors. The morality of Chri&s;t is the mo&s;t perfect and admirable &s;y&s;tem which ever appeared, or can be conceived of, as applicable to the &s;tate and &s;itua|tion of mankind. Con&s;idered in its due extent, it embraces our whole duty to God and men; it re|gulates not only every action of our external con|duct, but al&s;o forms every di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, controls every faculty of the &s;oul, and exerci&s;es a &s;overeign authority over every &s;ecret of the heart. It is always beautiful, and harmonizes with it&s;elf in all its parts. In no ca&s;e, and to no man does it grant indulgence of unrightcou&s;ne&s;s. But to preach this moral rule in all its extent is not to preach the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> So far from it, that they, who have in&s;i&s;ted upon it, &s;o, as to obtain the name of <HI>Moral preachers,</HI> have in fact &s;ubverted the go&s;pel, and broken the moral law into a thou&s;and pieces, a
<PB N="42" REF="032281_0054_0FF1B235F3D94CD8">few of which are gathered up, by tho&s;e who mean to go to heaven by the merit of their works, and they con&s;ider them&s;elves as enriched by their par|tial acqui&s;itions. Archimedes, exulting in the &s;uc|ce&s;s of an experiment in mechanics, exclaimed, <HI>Find me a place to &s;tand upon, and I will move the earth!</HI> The&s;e Moral Preachers, are in the very dilemma of the Philo&s;opher.&mdash;Could their engine move the earth, they want a &s;olid &s;pot to fix it up|on. Unle&s;s they &s;upply this defect, their boa&s;ted morals are good for nothing; and their zeal to do good a mere beating the air. The Go&s;pel Preach|er &s;upplies their defect, and both magnifies and e&s;|tabli&s;hes the law in all its extent, and &s;pirituality, by placing it on the glorious, everla&s;ting founda+tion, of Chri&s;t crucified. Ju&s;tice, mercy, truth, however we may differ in the application of the terms, are things, in which Heathens will think them&s;elves as well informed as ourfelves: But the original rectitude and &s;ub&s;equent depravity of man, the incarnation and death of the Son of God for our redemption, a free ju&s;tification by the grace of God, a regeneration of the whole man, con&s;i&s;t|ent univer&s;al holine&s;s, enforced on the ground that we are not our own, but Chri&s;t's, the &s;upernatural &s;uccors of the Divine Spirit, and the commanding doctrines of eternal judgment, are things of which they have no conception. The&s;e grand, forcible truths, with the varied apparatus which belong to them, are tho&s;e on which mi&s;&s;ionaries are called to in&s;i&s;t; and the crucified Je&s;us is the central point from which all the lines of our divinity mu&s;t be drawn. In a word our mi&s;&s;ionaries mu&s;t be go&s;pel mini&s;ters, and not merely moral ones.</P>
<P><HI>He that believeth and is bapti&s;ed &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> &s;aid the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, <HI>and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> This &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on with becom|ing firmne&s;s; but I incline to think, that we &s;hould
<PB N="43" REF="032281_0055_0FF1B23ABA91BE70">not abroad, and e&s;pecially in the early &s;tages of our Mi&s;&s;ion, deal &s;o freely in the figure anathema, as we do at home. In England every man profe&s;&s;es Chri&s;tianity, and is &s;ufficiently acquainted with the leading principles of our faith to criminate his di&s;|obedience. We may argue with him from his own data, and a&s;&s;ume with him a tone of authority, which will not be ju&s;tifiable with poor Heathens. The progre&s;s of the human mind in the inve&s;tiga|tion of truth is not rapid, e&s;pecially when it is clouded with inveterate prejudices. We &s;hould, therefore, be careful how we bring in our damna|tory clau&s;es prematurely, again&s;t a people, who are not acquainted with our principles, and can form no e&s;timate of the con&s;equences of rejecting them. This ob&s;ervation might, perhaps, have been &s;par|ed; although I hope to meet with indulgence for in&s;erting it.</P>
<P>I have before &s;aid, that in another place I &s;hould give my rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to di&s;charge married men, and fathers of families, from this warfare. Single men will be expo&s;ed from the infirmity of their nature to think of entering into the conjugal &s;tate. This is a propen&s;ity which it would be well to di&s;courage as much as po&s;&s;ible, without advanc|ing &s;o far as to criminate men for complying with the imperious will of heaven. But much attention &s;hould be paid to the manner in which mi&s;&s;ionaries ally them&s;elves. Upon this head no certain rules can be given. Among politer nations fewer oppor|tunities will occur of marrying into noble families, and among more &s;avage tribes I fear it is hardly to be wi&s;hed. A <HI>heathen</HI> woman would be a very de|grading companion for a Chri&s;tian Mi&s;&s;ionary; and the example would have a fatal tendency on our converts.</P>
<P>The preaching of the go&s;pel, with fidelity and boldne&s;s, implies a con&s;iderable &s;hare of publicity;
<PB N="44" REF="032281_0056_0FF1B23F61B09E58">but nothing &s;hould be guarded again&s;t with more attention than an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of Chri&s;tiani|ty. While our converts are few, per&s;ecution is not to be feared; but as truth prevails the enemy of our &s;alvation will &s;tir up his emi&s;&s;aries. While, therefore, we &s;hun no di&s;covery of our&s;elves, as far as the pro&s;perity of the go&s;pel is concerned, we &s;hould be careful how we give a handle to the De|vil and his Children, by counting numbers and boa&s;ting of noble converts. In all things, it becomes Chri&s;tians to carry their faculties with meekne&s;s; but in nothing &s;hould we give &s;tronger demon&s;trations of humility, gentlene&s;s, and una&s;&s;uming mode&s;ty, than in the introduction of our religion among a foreign people.</P>
<P>There are two ranks of men whom our mi&s;&s;iona|ries &s;hould manage with peculiar caution and addre&s;s &mdash;I mean the Prie&s;ts and Chiefs of a Heathen peo|ple, e&s;pecially the King, if their labors &s;hould fall within the &s;phere of royalty. Let them remember, that, in every country, Prie&s;ts have a &s;trong hold on the &s;entiments of mankind. If they are not &s;incere, humble, pious and benevolent, the oppo|&s;ite qualities may be expected to predominate in them, more &s;trongly than in other men. In mo&s;t, perhaps all &s;y&s;tems of Heatheni&s;m, there is not on|ly much &s;uper&s;tition, but al&s;o a large &s;hare of <HI>im|po&s;ture.</HI> As public deceivers, Heathen Prie&s;ts <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be bad men. Prie&s;ts live by their religion; hence they are the bloodie&s;t, and mo&s;t malignant per&s;ecutors. The per&s;ecutions of the laity are affairs of policy and fanatici&s;m, and are not in|flamed with per&s;onal rancor. The Prie&s;t con|tends, at once, for his honors, his gains, and his Gods. Here we have to cope with three of the &s;tronge&s;t principles of human corruption, fanati|ci&s;m, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and pride; all which are dri|ven to madne&s;s by the &s;ecret guilt of unprincipled
<PB N="45" REF="032281_0057_0FF1B241044A7AF0">fal&s;hood. It is equally the intere&s;t of the&s;e men to with&s;tand our words, as it is in their power to do &s;o. Their friend&s;hip will, therefore, be &s;u&s;pici|ous; their a&s;&s;ociation unde&s;irable. An ob&s;equi|ous, but di&s;tant, and guarded re&s;pect will be all they merit at our hands. Fair appearances and ha&s;ty overtures &s;hould not be credited from men of their character. Nor will the mind, inclining to conver&s;ion, and characterized by humility and earne&s;tne&s;s, be di&s;couraged by a prudent re&s;erve in his in&s;tructor. Religious conviction is a principle too forcibly operative to be long concealed; and until it developes it&s;elf by unque&s;tionable te&s;timony, we &s;hould not commit our&s;elves to the dangers of an ea&s;y faith. If God &s;hould indeed touch their hearts, they will be the mo&s;t potent auxilliaries, and worth a hundred of their countrymen.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Chiefs, we know that power, affluence and honor deprave the heart. They are an order of men, who do not, in general affect re|ligion. As wicked men, they de&s;pi&s;e and hate it; and, as wordly politicians, they fear it. Accu&s;tom|ed to command in civil matters, which they under|&s;tand, and in which they have a natural claim to take the lead, they are forward to u&s;urp authority in things &s;acred, over which, as God has given them no juri&s;diction, &s;o it is in the power of man to give them none. Did not truth compel the con|fe&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould wi&s;h not to &s;ay, that even Chri&s;ti|an Prie&s;ts, by bold inroads on the &s;ecular power, have &s;trengthened this propen&s;ity in the great, who cannot now think them&s;elves in &s;afety, while reli|gion is free. Hence the bold attempts to bind this cele&s;tial &s;tranger with the fetters of human laws. Without expatiating farther on this topic, it may &s;uffice to &s;ay, that, on a &s;maller &s;cale, religion and her mini&s;ters mu&s;t expect to meet, in Otaheite, ob|&s;tructions &s;imilar to tho&s;e under which &s;he labors
<PB N="46" REF="032281_0058_0FF1B242A26A16D0">in Europe. To a&s;&s;ert the freedom of religion and her mini&s;ters calls for <HI>actions</HI> and not for words. The mi&s;&s;ionary mu&s;t prove by his conduct, and mi|ni&s;try, that his religion is a <HI>heavenly thing,</HI> and him&s;elf a <HI>heavenly man.</HI> He mu&s;t &s;hew that go|vernment has every thing to hope, and nothing to fear from religion. He mu&s;t inviolably ad|here to his principles; for the moment he de&s;erts them, and treads on unhallowed ground; that mo|ment he &s;tretches out his hand to receive the chain, and betrays religion to the &s;ecular power. By af|fecting the favor of the great we degrade our mi|ni&s;try, endanger our own &s;alvation, and render the men we flatter and fawn upon wor&s;e than they were before. Any extraordinary zeal to make noble pro|&s;elytes indicates mercenary and ambitious views. The rich are no le&s;s &s;agacious than the poor in di&s;|covering the motive of our conduct. They accept our adulation, and de&s;pi&s;e us for it. Had the Ro|man Mi&s;&s;ionaries kept at an awful di&s;tance from the imperial thrones of China and Japan, they and their converts might, perhaps, have lived in peace to this day. And the imitation of their conduct, even in Otaheite, might overwhelm Prote&s;tant Mi&s;&s;ionaries in &s;imilar ruin. Piety and benevolence will command e&s;teem, and give us all the influence we can want. Let Chri&s;tian Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and their converts, &s;hew them&s;elves the mo&s;t peaceable, loyal, and affectionate of &s;ubjects, and this not from policy, but for con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing I &s;hall guard mi&s;&s;ionaries again&s;t, is the u&s;urpation of dominion over their flocks, and particularly dominions of a &s;ecular kind. Such a conduct will merit the abhorrence of God and men: and mu&s;t draw per&s;ecution on them&s;elves. The &s;tate of tho&s;e I&s;lands might induce men of en|terpri&s;e, under the &s;pecious pretext of civilization, to advance farther than they intended without be|ing
<PB N="47" REF="032281_0059_0FF1B245D93F4990">aware of the con&s;equences; and the ignorance, confidence, and docility of their converts may be expected to throw into their hands a degree of power and influence, which are liable to the vile&s;t abu&s;e. Let them, therefore, meditate on the hi&s;|tory of the Church, reflect on their own weakne&s;s, and remember, that they, who &s;ucceed to their la|bors, will have a greater love of command, as they may not have their piety, and at the &s;ame time will be in circum&s;tances more favorable to the u&s;urpa|tion of dominion, than they them&s;elves now are.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;tianity is no better &s;erved by our Mi&s;|&s;ions, than &s;he has been for centuries pa&s;t, all the&s;e admonitions may be &s;pared; for they will have no occa&s;ion to be applied; but if Mi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be taken up in the way I propo&s;e, and meet with the &s;ucce&s;s, which I am &s;anguine enough to flatter my|&s;elf they would do from that way of conducting them, e&s;pecially in the South Sea I&s;lands, they are nece&s;&s;ary, and merit all attention.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE qualifications of the mi&s;&s;ionary enter &s;o deeply into my &s;ubject, that I cannot pa&s;s them by, without offering you my opinion. But on this point, as well as on many others, which I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I certainly do not mean to &s;peak as ex cathedr&acirc;. Different opinions will prevail on what I have to offer; and they, who are above others intere&s;ted in it, as being willing them&s;elves to en|gage in Mi&s;&s;ions, will certainly do well to abide by their own.</P>
<P>Piety is the only ba&s;is of the mi&s;&s;ionary charac|ter. Every attempt to convert others, while we our&s;elves are unconverted, is ab&s;urd and nugatory, On this it is unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t. They, who are de&s;titute of the faith and hope of the go&s;pel, are never likely to volunteer in this &s;ervice. Gold, which has transformed &s;o many Apo&s;tles of the Devil into the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, might al&s;o make them mi&s;&s;ionaries; but it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to pre|clude the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch inducement. Let god|line&s;s, and not gain, be the only object propo&s;ed to their choice, and we &s;hall effectually &s;hut the door again&s;t all mercenaries.</P>
<P>But in the qualification of the mi&s;&s;ionary, we mu&s;t enquire not only into the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of his pie|ty, but al&s;o into the <HI>power</HI> of it. We &s;hould in|jure many by que&s;tioning their piety, who are yet not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that vigorous and &s;teadfa&s;t faith, that joyous hope, and that &s;ervent love, which are ab&s;olutery nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a man under all the
<PB N="49" REF="032281_0061_0FF1B24D82C584B8">&s;acrifices, dangers, hard&s;hips, and di&s;couragements of a mi&s;&s;ionary warfare. The tree, that is green, flouri&s;hing, and fruitful, while it &s;tands in a rich &s;oil, and is theltered by a &s;urrounding wood, might wither and die, or be torn up by its roots, if re|moved to a heath, where it enjoys-none of the &s;ame advantages. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, that a man, who&s;e piety would have &s;aved him&s;elf and his neighbor, in England, might, in India or Otaheite, lo&s;e his own &s;oul, and become a &s;tumbling block to others. This is an awful con&s;ideration; and, if at|tended to, would prevent all ra&s;hne&s;s, either in en|gaging our&s;elves, or in per&s;uading others to engage, in Mi&s;&s;ions. A tolerable &s;trength and maturity of religion, will, therefore, be as needful as the &s;in|cerity of it.</P>
<P>Zeal is a qualification for Mi&s;&s;ions of a nature inferior only to piety. It is in a con&s;iderable de|gree its in&s;eperable concomitant; and that man will hardly be defective in it, who enters upon Mi&s;&s;ions &s;u&acirc; &s;ponte, and in compliance with the bent of his own inclination. The great matter will be to determine, whether this zeal be the pure flame of piety, and has heavenly oil to feed its fire, or is the re&s;ult of an ardent temperament and a &s;plendid imagination. When there is evidently a mixture, which I &s;u&s;pect is generally the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t di&s;cover, by a moral analy&s;is, what may be referred to nature, and what to grace; and deter|mine on a man's qualification in this re&s;pect, as there is the larger &s;hare of valuable bullion, or of ba&s;e alloy.</P>
<P>Here I cannot but indulge an ob&s;ervation, which &s;trikes me as being of con&s;iderable weight. A Mi&s;&s;ion is an undertaking &s;o extremely remote from the common concerns of life, and carries in it &s;o much to revolt the heart, that when men of re|puted piety, freely offer them&s;elves for it, there is
<PB N="50" REF="032281_0062_0FF1B24F2416E828">a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that, in following the bent of their own inclinations, they do not altogether mi&s;take their proper object. We &s;hould be ex|tremely fearful in counteracting the Holy Gho&s;t, who, if we would &s;ubmit to his wi&s;dom, would not fail to &s;et apart proper in&s;truments for the work. Should, therefore, one or other mi&s;&s;ionary qualification, not exi&s;t &s;o eminently as we could wi&s;h, in the man who offers him&s;elf; yet this no|ble volunteering, in a cau&s;e, where every princi|ple of nature mu&s;t be laid on the cro&s;s, &s;eems to imply &s;o very much, that our objections mu&s;t be palpable indeed, before we are ju&s;tifiable in reject|ing him. God &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth; and, if David's youth and unwarlike appearance had been more regarded, than the hone&s;t indignation and noble confidence, with which he came forward to a&s;&s;ert the honor of the Lord of ho&s;ts, I&s;rael had wanted the only champion capable of upholding his glory.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that the mi&s;&s;ionary's zeal &s;hould not have been lately kindled, but &s;uch as hav|ing burned for years promi&s;es to continue in its beat. But his zeal may be too hot, as well as too cold. His fire &s;hould be moderated, by &s;ome expe|rience in the mini&s;try. Zeal and conrage will be likely to precipitate an unexperienced young man into ra&s;h mea&s;ures and intemperance of mind; and he may fall the victim of impatience and di&s;ap|pointment. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould have been taught to exerci&s;e a good degree of gentlene&s;s, patience, and long &s;ufferance; by being accu&s;tomed to wre&s;tle with the unruly will of men, by &s;eeing many of his well meant efforts fru&s;trated through invincible depravity, and by ob&s;erving the failure of &s;ome of his mo&s;t &s;anguine and rea&s;onable expectations. Add to this, there is an art in managing men's minds, which nothing
<PB N="51" REF="032281_0063_0FF1B252276DCFA0">but experience can teach him, and that man will have little &s;kill in ruling the tempe&s;t of the human pa&s;&s;ions, who has not learned to moderate the ardor of his own feelings; and who does not know when to pre&s;s his point and when to decline it, when to command and when to entreat; and how to avail him&s;elf of all the molla tempora fandi.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome worthy,&mdash;&s;ome pious men, who are capable of every thing, and yet do very little in life. They are di&s;orderly in all their habits and ver&s;atile in all their pur&s;uits. Superior to fear, they are, unhappily, ductile, and receive the im|pre&s;&s;ion of minds inferior to their own. Capable of va&s;t exertions, they are naturally indolent. With a vivacity, which often &s;parkles and charms, they unite a morbid melancholy which preys upon the heart. They are amiable, but not venerable. Such men may engage in Mi&s;&s;ions, but will hardly &s;ucceed in them. The mi&s;&s;ionary &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s much &s;elf denial, and be regular in all his habits. He needs not have the raizor's edge; but he mu&s;t be as the blade of a well tempered knife. He mu&s;t be a man of di&s;cipline and &s;elf command.</P>
<P>His character &s;hould be dive&s;ted of &s;loth, effemi|nacy and indulgence. Perhaps, he &s;hould rather be capable of becoming a man of letters, than ac|tually be &s;o. All his habits &s;hould be active rather than &s;edentary. A di&s;po&s;ition favorable to the feel|ings of ardent and &s;ublime devotion, and a delight in the exerci&s;es of the pulpit and the pa&s;toral care, &s;uperior to what he receives from the &s;tudies of elo|quence, languages, and all things &s;ab&s;idiary to his mini&s;try, &s;hould preponderate in his character. In a word, he &s;hould be more the active man, than the contemplative one. A &s;ound con&s;titution, har|dened to the vici&s;&s;itude of the &s;ea&s;ons, and capable of &s;upporting the extremes of &s;ufferance is greatly to be de&s;ired: but a mind &s;uperior to &s;uffering is a
<PB N="52" REF="032281_0064_0FF1B258734A2468">con&s;ideration of far more importance, than that corporeal vigor and hardine&s;s which is invulnerable to fatigue and want.</P>
<P>We require in our mi&s;&s;ionary a di&s;intere&s;ted, ge|nerous way of thinking and acting, above low cun|ning, &s;ervile compliance, and a pre&s;umptuous in|va&s;ion of powers to which his character does not entitle him. We would have him &s;incere, open, and affectionate. In&s;tead of authoritative commands we would arm him with prayers, entreaties, and tears. We expect that he &s;hould have learned to bear and forbear. We think that ignorance &s;hould excite his pity, and not rou&s;e his contempt. We would not have him &s;hun the a&s;&s;ociation of the poor &s;avages he would convert; but we &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee him &s;ink into indolent familiarity, and indi&s;|criminating communicativene&s;s, which betray a re|laxed mind that has no guard over it&s;elf. Silence he &s;hould have learned to e&s;teem as a grand partof mini&s;terial prudence. He <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> an extempore preacher, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a facility of conveying to the mind his ideas clear and &s;trong, independent of tho&s;e modes of &s;peech which originate in the laws and manners of Europe. He mu&s;t be far remov|ed from narrow bigotry, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pirit truly catholic. It is not Calvini&s;m, it is not Armin|iani&s;m, but Chri&s;tianity, that he is to teach. It is not the hierarchy of the Church of England; it is not the prinicples of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, that he has in view to propagate. His object is to &s;erve the Church Univer&s;al. It is not latitudinariani&s;m of principles, but largene&s;s of affection, which I recommend to the mi&s;&s;ionary. I would not have him indifferent to his own peculiarities, whether they re&s;pect the doctrines he receives as truth, or the points of eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity he con&s;iders as mo&s;t friendly to religion; but I would have him thoroughly &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;ucce&s;s of his mini&s;|try
<PB N="53" REF="032281_0065_0FF1B25A06952E40">re&s;ts not on the points of &s;eparation, but on tho&s;e wherein all godly men are united. He &s;hould know to what place in the grand &s;cale of truth he is to refer cach article of his creed; and be infinite|ly more concerned to make men Chri&s;tians than to make them Church of England men, Di&s;&s;enters, or Methodi&s;ts. Would to God this were more at|tended to among us! and then, in&s;tead of ob&s;erv|ing with jealou&s;y the pro&s;perity of any other Deno|mination of Chri&s;tians, and con&s;idering it as an ob&s;truction to the &s;ucce&s;s of our own party, we &s;hall rejoice in hearing that Chri&s;t is preached, and &s;ouls are &s;aved.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid on the qualifications of the mi&s;&s;ionary; but I &s;hall fini&s;h this &s;ubject by ob&s;erving, that his character cannot be too perfect, nor his talents too great, nor too highly cultivated for this calling. But in addition to what is includ|ed in the idea of a godly man, there is a va&s;t pro|gre&s;&s;ion of ability, between the extremes of talents, &s;o limited as to exclude a man from Mi&s;&s;ions or &s;o great as to give him a lead in them. We may err by requiring too much, and by being &s;atisfied with too little. What a mi&s;&s;ionary is expected to do and to &s;uffer &s;hould always enter into the e&s;timate we make of his qualifications.</P>
<P>The man who reads the Engli&s;h language and has good &s;en&s;e enough to make u&s;e of Henry's commentary on the Scriptures, may be of ine&s;tima|ble benefit to the lower orders of people in Eng|land, though he be unfit to in&s;truct the intelligent, and &s;hould torture the ears of the polite. Such a man may be a very proper mi&s;&s;ionary to the Negro Slaves in our We&s;t India I&s;lands. No compa&s;s of talents is required for &s;uch a &s;ituation; nor do I conceive that &s;uch an engagement, will require one jot more piety, or bind him over to &s;uffer more hard&s;hip, than he will have occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e in

<P>Where a language is to be learned, European comforts to be relinqui&s;hed, and a Mi&s;&s;ion is to be taken up under all the di&s;couragements which u&s;u|ally attend the undertaking, we require more ex|perienced piety, warmer zeal, and better talents. The mi&s;&s;ionary &s;hould at lea&s;t, be furni&s;hed with the rudiments of grammar, and &s;ome general knowlege of men and things&punc; as well as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an under&s;tanding capable of improvement, and a &s;pi|rit of application to improve it.

But, even in China, the bulk of the people are on the &s;ame par of information with the common people in our own land, and many mi&s;&s;ionaries of inferior talents might very well be a&s;&s;ociated with a few of greater ability.</P>
<P>In the e&s;tabli&s;hment, I believe the &s;entiment has prevailed pretty generally, that mi&s;&s;ionares &s;hould be men of learning; and under the influence of this idea &s;ome worthy candidates for Mi&s;&s;ions have been rejected for in&s;ufficiency. The Methodi&s;ts and &s;ome Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, I am apprehen&s;ive, incline too much to the oppo&s;ite extreme. For I have heard it &s;ugge&s;ted among them, that their <HI>weake&s;t mini&s;ters,</HI> who can be of little &s;ervice in Europe, are very proper for mi&s;&s;ionaries. In this &s;entiment there is <HI>&s;ome</HI> truth; but we form very erroneous ideas of Mi&s;&s;ions, if we &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch men <HI>only</HI> are wanting for the &s;ervice. We mu&s;t have men to lead as well as to follow; and even in the We&s;t India I&s;lands, where I have &s;uppo&s;ed pi|ous mi&s;&s;ionaries of the &s;malle&s;t gifts to be &s;uffici|ent

In every place, but the We&s;t-Indies, a Mi&s;&s;ionary will require good talents, as well as the mo&s;t exemplary piety. Under &s;helter of the opi|nion that men of the be&s;t talents mu&s;t be kept at home, we &s;hall give too much encouragement to that &s;elf complacency which cleaves to men of ta|lents, and grant them a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the &s;ervice, which they will be glad to avail them&s;elves of. But I cannot believe tho&s;e Gentlemen think &s;oberly of them&s;elves, as they ought to do, who &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves too great and too con&s;iderable to engage in Mi&s;&s;ions. One would think that con&s;idering the nature of the work, and the di&s;advantages we lie under from the want of Apo&s;tolic credentials, we &s;hould wi&s;h as much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;upply their place by talents and learning. Piety is better than learning, and learning with piety has great advan|age over piety alone. Every thing el&s;e being equal in our Mi&s;&s;ions, that Mi&s;&s;ion will certainly be mo&s;t productive which claims the mo&s;t learned mi&s;&s;iona|ries. As a man of no learning my&s;elf I cannot but feel it a little contemptuous for me and my poor Brethren, who are like my&s;elf illeterate men, to be &s;hoved with &s;o much good will into the hotte&s;t front of the battle, by men who are fitter for the work, but who claim that very fitne&s;s, as the apo|logy for their &s;itting &s;till. On the other hand could I boa&s;t of talents and of letters, and con&s;ider my&s;elf as a leading man in the Church, I &s;hould blu&s;h to &s;ee a few &s;ubalterns generou&s;ly expo&s;ing them&s;elves in a warfare which I &s;hunned.</P>
<P>Let us then endeavor to pre&s;erve a mean between the&s;e dangerous extremes. Let no worthy volun|teer be rejected for incompetence of learning; nor
<PB N="56" REF="032281_0068_0FF1B2621D9CF690">let us allow of any man's pleading his literature and popular elocution as a di&s;charge from the war. As bringing our gifts to the Lord's trea&s;ury, let us give largely and freely, and, after all, learn to know that we are <HI>unprofitable</HI> &s;ervants. But though we could ca&s;t in our ten thou&s;and talents, let us be|ware of treating with contempt our poor brother, who after the example of the widow, who was ble&s;&s;ed in her deed, &s;hall offer his two mites for the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary. He may, for ought we know, have pre&s;ented a richer offering than us all.

<P>Somewhat &s;imilar to the que&s;tion between learn|ed and unlearned mi&s;&s;ionaries, is another between married and &s;ingle men, which of them we &s;hould con&s;ider mo&s;t eligible for Mi&s;&s;ions. But the&s;e que&s;ti|ons &s;eem to proceed, both of them, on a fal&s;e ground. They &s;uppo&s;e that Mini&s;ters learned and unlearned, married and &s;ingle, are &s;o very zealous of prefer|ment in this way, that our choice is puzzled, and we need great deliberation on whom we &s;hall con|fer the ob&s;olete honors of hunger, thir&s;t, heat, cold, nakedne&s;s, &s;ickne&s;s, poverty, contempt, per|&s;ecutions, and death. But the ca&s;e is altogether different. We <HI>wi&s;h</HI> for &s;ome learning in our mi&s;&s;i|onaries;
<PB N="57" REF="032281_0069_0FF1B266D29625F0">but we mu&s;t be content, for one man of letters, to receive twenty, who have no preten&s;ion to learning. It will be the &s;ame with men, who have wives and families, &s;hould we prefer them. They will not generally be prevailed upon to look Mi&s;&s;ions in the face. And as I am more di&s;po&s;ed to rea&s;on from facts, than from preconceived theories, and much inclined to believe that men's minds, like waters, finds their own level, I conceive that, from the invincible aver&s;ion which men of learning and fathers of families &s;hew to this bu&s;ine&s;s, we may arrive at the conclu&s;ion, that they are not, <HI>general|ly</HI> &s;peaking, proper per&s;ons for Mi&s;&s;ions. A few great leaders appear ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and if learned men were equally willing to become mi&s;&s;i|onaries, they would claim a preference; but as they are not equally willing, and as they will probably never be &s;o, we not only may, but mu&s;t give them the di&s;charge they require. We mu&s;t do the &s;ame with married men. I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that the relations of hu&s;band and father con&s;idered &s;im|ply in them&s;elves, ab&s;olutely prohibit the engage|ment; but I am fully of opinion that there is a wide difference between the ca&s;e of learned and married men inli&s;ting for this war. If there be equal piety in the learned, learning mu&s;t give them great advantage over the unlearned. With re&s;pect to the married, as they mu&s;t be greater &s;ufferers in Mi&s;&s;ions than the &s;ingle, they &s;hould have more zeal and piety than &s;ingle men to engage them to &s;uffer; and, even with this advantage, the incum|brances of a wife and family mu&s;t lay in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles in the way of their acting, with that en|ergy and deci&s;ion we may expect from &s;ingle men. As I find public opinion leaning much in favor of the claims of married men, it may be worth our while to &s;tate the rea&s;ons urged on both &s;ides, and to examine on which they are the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="032281_0070_0FF1B2686945DB60">
In favor of the married, it is urged, that their wives would be extremely &s;erviceable in a mi&s;&s;i|onary e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;that they would be very u&s;e|ful among their own &s;ex, e&s;pecially in the Ea&s;t where women are &s;ecluded and the &s;anctity of the Haram would be polluted by the pre&s;ence of any but female mi&s;&s;ionaries; and that they would be a &s;afeguard to the characters of their hu&s;bands, which might otherwi&s;e &s;uffer from a mini&s;terial in|tercour&s;e with female converts. To enforce the&s;e arguments, is adduced the example of the Unitas Fratrum, who in their Mi&s;&s;ions generally make u&s;e of married men.</P>
<P>It is granted a pious, active, healthy woman, might be &s;erviceable in a mi&s;&s;ionary in&s;titution: but it &s;hould be remembered that the &s;ex in gene|ral are not calculated to &s;upport hard&s;hip; that young women, who are bearing children, more frequently require to be waited upon, than are able to wait on others; and that the care of a young fa|mily will leave them little time to aid their hu&s;bands mi&s;&s;ionary labors. And if it be con&s;idered that the men who will engage in Mi&s;&s;ions are generally &s;uch as are in the prime of their years, our mi&s;&s;i|onary e&s;tabli&s;hments may &s;oon be expected to be very populous. With re&s;pect to the &s;ervice hop|ed from them of introducing Chri&s;tianity into A&s;i|atic Harams, I fear they will not effect much. Hu&s;bands have, in general, more influence in forming the religious principles of their wives, than wives have on tho&s;e of their hu&s;bands. If the men are converted, they will carry their reli|gion home to their wives; and if they can once be prevailed on to embrace our religion, it is not unrea&s;onable to think, that they will &s;oon adopt our manners, and give us as free an intercour&s;e in their families as is to be wi&s;hed. The protection they may afford to their hu&s;bands morals, as well
<PB N="59" REF="032281_0071_0FF1B26A32BE72B0">as their characters, I &s;hall not affect to de&s;pi&s;e; but it cannot be weighed again&s;t the di&s;advantages they would lay them under in their work. Nor is the example of the Moravians to the point. They are in this, and many other re&s;pects, a &s;ingular people. And, if it might not give offence to the wives of mini&s;ters of other Denominations, I &s;hould &s;ay that their women are educated in a way which render them fitter companions for mi&s;&s;ionaries than any other women in the world. But, in addition to what I have here advanced, much more is to be &s;aid. I have recommended Mi&s;&s;ions to be taken up on a larger &s;cale, and with a bolder &s;pirit of enter|prize, than that in which they have been hitherto conducted. If, therefore, a &s;ew women and their families might be &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;ituations, were accommodations are to be had for them, neverthe|le&s;s they will be unfit companions for the lar|ger part of mi&s;&s;ionaries, who will be engaged in perpetual travels and labors among a Heathen Na|tion, where they mu&s;t undergo all po&s;&s;ible hard&s;hips. I propo&s;e to &s;end forth mi&s;&s;ionaries in large num|bers, and I &s;uppo&s;e that the fruit of their labors, the humanity of the natives, and the large&s;t &s;up|plies which can be &s;ent from Europe, will altoge|ther form a fund very inadequate to the &s;upport of women and children. I expect, if they have the &s;ouls of mi&s;&s;ionaries in them, that they will often, between their charity and their zeal, be placed in circum&s;tance; &s;imilar to tho&s;e of St. Paul, in na|kedne&s;s, in want, in perils by land, in perils by &s;ea, and in all the varieties of &s;uffering. And are the&s;e men to have wives and children? Will men of a &s;pirit like this be likely to pine for the indul|gence of a lady's lap?</P>
<P>If I am thought to have lo&s;t my&s;elf in the regions of romance and to be conjuring up inchanted ca&s;|tles which never did exi&s;t, for the ideal plea&s;ure
<PB N="60" REF="032281_0072_0FF1B271F1B95EC0">of killing giants, chaining lions, di&s;&s;olving &s;pells, and freeing captive dames, I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t, like the Knight of La Mancha, to vindicate the &s;anity of my intellect, and to affirm that the things I talk of have exi&s;ted, and will exi&s;t again, and that until they are made to do &s;o, I am a &s;ober man, and read my book accurately. The &s;oundne&s;s of their in|tellect may rather be &s;u&s;pected, who think of &s;end|ing half a dozen married mi&s;&s;ionaries and their fa|milies to India, to give them &s;nug births and good &s;alaries at Calcutta, or other European Settlements, where they are to &s;uperintend a &s;chool, and preach to a few luxurious Europeans, and &s;uch Natives as care to come into their Churches. And for what purpo&s;e all this a&s;toni&s;hing apparatus? To con|vert the Natives of Indo&s;tan to Chri&s;tianity! And by what year of our Lord may we expect that the Go&s;pel will be &s;pread through that Empire? As &s;oon might one hope to empty the &s;ea by lading it out with buckets, or think of giving light to the world by the glimmering rays of half a dozen wax tapers! Surely gentlemen who will only pa|tronize Mi&s;&s;ions conducted on this &s;cale, and grave|ly talk to the would of their wi&s;h to &s;pread the go&s;pel, cannot reproach me for credulity and en|thu&s;ia&s;m. I am not weak enough to &s;uppo&s;e an Apo&s;tolic work, &s;uch as the conver&s;ion of the Hea|then Nations is, can be effected in any but an Apo&s;|tolic way. Had the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves &s;et down in India to teach Schools, and to act as parochial Mini&s;ters, not all their miraculous credentials would have &s;pread the go&s;pel there. The Reve|rend Mr. Swartz, a Dani&s;h Mi&s;&s;ionary, and one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and &s;ucce&s;sful men, who has appeared under that character in Indo&s;tan, has &s;o and it nece&s;&s;ary to travel a good deal about in preaching the go&s;pel; and a few others, po&s;&s;ibly imitate his example&mdash;I do not mean to repre&s;ent

He therefore preaches out of doors, and lays hold of every opportunity of going among them. But, I fear his example meets not with general imitation; and, if it did, as married men cannot do what ought to be done in that way, &s;o the number of mi&s;&s;ionaries employed there is ina|dequate to the work. Whatever difficulties, there|fore, there may be in finding a &s;ufficient number of mi&s;&s;ionaries for &s;uch an attempt, it mu&s;t be done, or nothing will be done worthy of our religion&mdash;worthy of God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h. And, if this is to be done, I believe few people will think it advi&s;e|able to carry wives and children into &s;o hot a war. For whatever mi&s;&s;ionaries are willing to fu&s;&s;er in their own per&s;ons, they will expect, and will have a right to expect, &s;uch a &s;upport for their wives and families, as an undertaking &s;o circum&s;tanced could not afford them.</P>
<P>Single men are then the proper per&s;ons for this work. They have no ties. Private charities will not counteract public ones. They can live cheap, fare hard, and are ready for every &s;ervice.

They will be the propere&s;t wives for them who are born in the country, &s;peak its language, are inured to the climate, and accu&s;|tomed to the manners of the inhabitants. Such women may be able to take a &s;hare in the hard&s;hips of a mi&s;&s;ionary life, and by their labor, as well as their connections, do &s;omething for the &s;upport
<PB N="62" REF="032281_0074_0FF1B276034858E8">of their Hu&s;bands. None of the&s;e advantages can be hoped from an European woman. If they are true converts, they will be animated by the zeal which attends &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a change; and that patriot love and warm attachment to our native land, which glows, more or le&s;s, in every human brea&s;t, will co-operate with it, to make them zealous auxilia|ries in converting their countrymen. They will attach their hu&s;bands to the country, and keep them &s;teady to the work. Their children educated in Chri&s;tianity, and endeared to the country in which they are born, and have many relatives, will &s;ome of them tread in the &s;teps of their fa|thers; and, though they &s;hould not, they will, in other re&s;pects, countenance and &s;upport the religi|on in which they were brought up&mdash;a religion which though they &s;hould not chu&s;e to practice, they will hardly for&s;ake for the deformed &s;y&s;tems of Heathen Super&s;tition. Whereas, the men who carry out with them European women and their children, will always have it in contemplation one day to return to England; they will be looking out with anxiety for ways and means to accompli&s;h that end; and if they &s;ee no hope of effecting it, their lives and their deaths will be embittered by the idea of leaving the women and little ones, whom they love dearer than life, de&s;titute and friendle&s;s in a foreign land. To &s;ay, they ought to put their tru&s;t in God, is nothing to the purpo&s;e: for we are not enquiring what men ought to do, but what con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of nature they will be mo&s;t expo&s;ed to do.

In this re&s;|pect, our Lord and his hou&s;ehold may be compared to the family of an opulent, indulgent Ma&s;ter of many &s;ervants, who commanding &s;ome unplea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s to be performed, but intimating his plea|&s;ure in general terms, not addre&s;&s;ed to any particu|lar dome&s;tic, his &s;ervants in&s;tead of readily obey|ing his commands, are all of them di&s;puting from his Lord&s;hip's Chaplain to the &s;kullion in his kitch|en, which of them is obliged to perform his will. The Chaplain is a gentleman, and is above &s;uch menial offices. His Lord certainly under&s;tands too well the dignity of his character to addre&s;s &s;uch orders to him. The Steward declares his engage|ments bind him no farther than to u&s;e his pen, and to overlook his Ma&s;ter's rents and di&s;bur&s;ements with fidelity. The Butler prote&s;ts he was not hir|ed to be a footman; and the underlings of the hou&s;e with many profe&s;&s;ions of good will, plead they are not qualified for doing their Lord's will. In a word, the bu&s;ine&s;s is either left undone, or a few poor hone&s;t fellows, who love their Ma&s;ter and are jealous for his honor, go forth and do their be&s;t; but not receiving from their fellow &s;ervants that a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which each ought to have afforded them, the bu&s;ine&s;s is done in a bungling way at la&s;t; and
<PB N="65" REF="032281_0077_0FF1B280A1E454A0">my Lord's Chaplain, Steward, Butler, and other &s;ervants, in&s;tead of feeling that it has mi&s;carried principally through their fault&mdash;in&s;tead of being a&s;hamed into exertion, &s;ay &s;ome of them, that their Lord "never gave &s;uch a command." others, "that the time for obeying it is not come," others, "that the bad &s;ucce&s;s of their fellows di&s;courages farther attempts," and while &s;ome are provoked that the menials of the hou&s;e &s;hould pre&s;ume to en|gage in the bu&s;ine&s;s, others, "declare it is vile dir|ty work and fit only for &s;kullions and &s;hoe-boys." This has been preci&s;ely our conduct in Mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But how may an individual know that this ge|neral duty determines on him? This enquiry will be made with views as different, as are the cha|racters of the men who make it: &s;ome to find a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for declining their duty; and oth|ers from a &s;incere de&s;ire to know and to do it. To the fir&s;t &s;ort, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to give &s;atisfac|tion. Their fir&s;t principle, <HI>I will not be a mi&s;&s;ion|ary,</HI> precludes all conviction.

They demand their call to be demon&s;trated with intuitive evidence; and while there remains a po&s;&s;ibility of their de|ceiving them&s;elves, prudently determine to run no hazards. Be it &s;o gentlemen. We di&s;mi&s;s you from the &s;ervice until you have acquired more in|genuous minds. Your &s;words may remain quietly in their &s;cabbards, for this is not a war in which lath will &s;upply the place of &s;teel. You are your own demon&s;trations that God does not call you to mi&s;&s;ions; and whatever &s;ins you may &s;tand accoun|table for in the day of Chri&s;t, I think you will hardly be criminated under that &s;tatute of his king|dom, <HI>Go preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</HI></P>

Sincere I&s;raelites, who, like Nathaniel, have ingenuous minds, and wor&s;hip God in truth, may on this &s;ubject be &s;atisfied, as clearly as on any oth|er, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is involved in the truth of the Go&s;pel. In the &s;criptures, in rea&s;on, in providence, in ex|perience of our own hearts and characters; and in our relations in private and in public life, there are to be di&s;covered data, from which we may come by a &s;imple proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, to a very tolerable conclu&s;ion of what is our duty in this in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>This call is certainly not of man, nor of the will of man. A &s;en&s;e of the worthine&s;s of the under|taking, and a general de&s;ire to do the will of God, with the &s;olicitations of friends who think highly of us, and who are of opinion, that there is a pro|vidential opening for us to go to the Heathen, do not con&s;titute a &s;ufficient warrant for engaging. Much, very much more than all this is required. The Moravian maxim, "Never to per&s;uade, much le&s;s to urge a man to engage in mi&s;&s;ions," has been ju&s;tified to them by experience; and it will appear perfectly rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the levers and pullies of human per&s;ua&s;ion, by which a man in|different to mi&s;&s;ions may, &s;ometimes, be excited to act in them, give no &s;ufficient momentum to the &s;oul to &s;upport it again&s;t the immen&s;e counterpoi&s;e of fle&s;h and blood. He, who appears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t lively zeal for mi&s;&s;ions, may deceive him|&s;elf by fal&s;e &s;ire, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic feelings; but the man who wants &s;ire, who is merely prompted by his friends, and &s;uppo&s;es a mi&s;&s;ion a matter to be ma|naged like a pari&s;h in England, equally deceives him&s;elf, though he declaims again&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m, and would have its under&s;tand, that he is following the le&s;s fallacious light of rea&s;on. But I exhort every one, who&s;e whole &s;oul is not in the bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;tand firm again&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ion of all men. He
<PB N="67" REF="032281_0079_0FF1B286A515E198">may be a&s;&s;ured that mi&s;&s;ionary work is too rough for his ductile nature. If he cannot &s;ay no to his friends, how &s;hall he &s;ay no to tho&s;e manifold temp|tations which will &s;olicit him to return? And I be|&s;eech all who have claims to rea&s;on, to religion, or to humanity, never to attempt to per&s;uade any one, directly or indirectly, to do any thing more in mi&s;&s;ions than he can do with plea&s;ure and unfeign|ed good will. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that our per&s;ua&s;ives can operate to change the character and in a moment to give a man &s;entiments and feel|ings he never had before. It is not agreeable to the oeconomy of religion, for God to leave the in|&s;truments of his will, without inclination, as well as ability for doing it. La&s;t of all, it is a mo&s;t inhuman per&s;ecution to in&s;i&s;t on its being the will of God that any individual &s;hould engage in Mi&s;&s;i|ons, or in any degree to a&s;&s;ume the province of heaven in pretending to &s;earch the heart, and di|rect the con&s;cience. This conduct is the more odi|ous, as it is an in&s;trument of torture, applied to none but worthy and pious minds, where we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to believe it unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Nor will providences which appear <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> and a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> willingne&s;s to engage, prove our call. Providence is a my&s;terious book, not ea&s;ily legible, and be&s;t under&s;tood when read backward; and I &s;hall much &s;u&s;pect that man's call is &s;hewn him by &s;udden and unexpected openings of Providence, who has never before made a di&s;covery of it in his Bi|ble, or in his own heart. From a general analogy of grace as well as nature, we are led to expect, that what is born and attains maturity in a day, will fade and die in as &s;hort a term. In a mi&s;&s;iona|ry we look for &s;trong, permanent, habits, &s;uch as are formed by reiterated acts. We do not mean to limit the Holy One of I&s;rael; but to re&s;pect Him as the God of order, means and ordinances.

We mu&s;t require the hor&s;e to be broken in for the battle. We mu&s;t ex|pect that the man called to Mi&s;&s;ions will experi|ence, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, all the vici&s;&s;itudes of hope, fear, de&s;ire, aver&s;ion, confidence and de&s;pondency, before he dips his foot in the water, or will be able to contem|plate with &s;teady courage the dangers of the&s;e depths.

<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations premi&s;ed, the fir&s;t thing to|wards con&s;tituting a call to Mi&s;&s;ions is ability to comply with it. Let the candidate, therefore, ex|amine him&s;elf, whether he be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a rea&s;on|able degree, of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for that &s;tation. From what he has done in the mini&s;try in England, he may form &s;ome gue&s;s of what he is likely to do abroad. It may al&s;o be proper to take the candid opinion of his mini&s;terial friends, who&s;e favorable &s;entiments will &s;upport his diffidence, or who&s;e hone&s;t cen&s;ure may check his temerity. On this &s;ubject, if on any, we &s;hall be &s;afe to un|der rate our qualifications; and, if we are humble, we &s;hall naturally be led to do &s;o. This, if it one way operates as a di&s;couragement, will in another produce different effects. God giveth grace to the humble, and mon will give them honor. An ham|ble opinion of our&s;elves will neither damp our zeal for God, nor our benevolence to men. It will not pervert our under&s;tandings, nor make us di&s;|honor God by di&s;claiming whatever degree of hum|ble
<PB N="69" REF="032281_0081_0FF1B28CE2C98868">fitne&s;s He may give us for the work. The greater the natural and acquired talents of any man be the better; but all this is not the great thing, the one thing, the living &s;pirit, the eye, the ear, the &s;trength and arms of the mi&s;&s;ionary, CHRISTIAN GODLINESS, THE MIND OF CHRIST, THE IMAGE OF GOD,&mdash;this is the qualification which a mi&s;&s;ionary cannot do without; which he cannot have in too great a degree; and which if he po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;trength and vigor, his other qualifications, however &s;mall, cannot be deemed defective. Up|on this &s;ubject, then, he cannot put to him&s;elf too many, or too clo&s;e que&s;tions. His &s;elf denial, activity, fortitude, per&s;everance, habitual dili|gence, and con&s;cientious adherence to order and re|gularity, throughout his whole conduct, will each of them merit minute inve&s;tigation. If the re|&s;ult of this enquiry be &s;atisfactory to him&s;elf, he may be a&s;&s;ured that he has, at lea&s;t, a &s;olid foun|dation to build upon.</P>
<P>The &s;econd head of enquiry is his <HI>willingne&s;s</HI> to engage in mi&s;&s;ions. Here &s;omething more is re|quired than cold approbation, or that general di&s;|po&s;ition to do the will of God, which influences every pious man. We look for a &s;trong, decided prediliction&mdash;<HI>a pa&s;&s;ion</HI> for mi&s;&s;ions, if I may be al|lowed the term; that &s;pecies of commendable en|thu&s;ia&s;m, which enables profe&s;&s;ional men to mag|nify the dignity and importance of their re&s;pective arts, and to pur&s;ue their object, under every di&s;|couragement, until they have carried their art to a perfection, which men of colder minds could never have &s;uppo&s;ed it capable of receiving. I would have him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;&s;|ons which Columbus had for di&s;covery, and which &s;upported him for a long cour&s;e of years again&s;t the ridicule of the whole world, again&s;t the di&s;|couragement of having his &s;ervices rejected by dif|ferent

I would have him &s;o enamoured of his object, as to con&s;ider the hard&s;hip and danger of the pur&s;uit a plea&s;ure rather than a pain; and to find in him&s;elf a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ucceed, or to peri&s;h in the attempt. If he cannot engage without a with to return to Europe, and with a full determination, God be|ing his helper, to die in the harne&s;s, that man has not the &s;oul of a genuine mi&s;&s;ionary.</P>
<P>Some of my readers will think I draw a glow|ing picture, and that my colorings betray the glare of enthu&s;ia&s;m. They would have their mi&s;&s;ionary, what they call, a prudent man, a man of rea&s;on and coolne&s;s. They will &s;ay that he who engages with &s;o much warmth will &s;oon have his fire damp|ed, and betray as much cowardice in the conflict, as he &s;hewed courage before the battle. I will en|treat &s;uch Geatlemen to give a candid interpreta|tion to my terms, and to eater into the &s;pirit of the writer, as well as into the force of his expre&s;|&s;ions. Human language is defective. They who u&s;e it are &s;till more imperfect. I may not have the felicity of expre&s;&s;ing the idea I would convey, exactly &s;uch as it is in my own mind; and though I could &s;tamp my ideas on language as clearly and forcibly, as new coin di&s;plays the impre&s;&s;ion of the die, yet except my thoughts had the &s;ame curren|cy as the Kings coin, my reader may ea&s;ily mi&s;take my meaning, where I have made none in expre&s;|&s;ing it; and in this manner every man who writes &s;u&s;tains &s;ome cen&s;ures which are due to the preci|pitancy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of his reader. In the light of this ob&s;ervation, I beg leave to remark, that Columbus, Cortez, Cae&s;ar, St. Paul, and all tho&s;e who have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne great things in the world, have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fire, and energy very uncommon; and
<PB N="71" REF="032281_0083_0FF1B2953B24A3E8">that this fire, this energy, was ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to what they undertook and what they performed; but certainly this remark does not &s;uppo&s;e that this fire alone effected every thing. They were men of knowlege, of prudence, and of that coolne&s;s which tempered their fire, and gave it a proper di|rection. Had they not been &s;upported by the&s;e &s;o|lid qualities Cae&s;ar might have peri&s;hed like Cata|line, and St. Paul would never have been God's in&s;trument for building the Church. If my mi&s;|&s;ionary therefore, has more zeal than good &s;en&s;e, more fire than wi&s;dom to command it, he will &s;oon find that in&s;tead of walking in the foot&s;teps of an Apo&s;tle, he is flying on the waxen wings of Icarus, or driving the de&s;tructive car of the juvenile and pre&s;umptuous Phaeton. Fal&s;e fire will not di&s;&s;olve real cold, nor fal&s;e courage &s;upport the bur&s;t of cannon.</P>
<P>But this conce&s;&s;ion made, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, the mi&s;&s;ionary mu&s;t not only have true fire, but a large proportion of it; and I in&s;i&s;t upon it &s;o much the more, as I &s;ee very little attention paid to it; as I cannot but think, that too many good men are forcing Zeno's coat upon the affectionate Je&s;us; and appear more afraid of offending men by being too hot, than of di&s;plea&s;ing God by being too cold. In&s;tead of bringing the world over to Chri&s;t by the godlike irre&s;i&s;tible charms of truth propo&s;ed with|out fal&s;e ornaments, we endeavor to accommedate it to corrupt minds, by propo&s;ing it under the garb of rea&s;on, and with the affected &s;ickly air and fee|ble tottering &s;teps of morality. In this manner we betray our Ma&s;ter, and lo&s;e our own labor. And, however digre&s;&s;ive this ob&s;ervation may ap|pear, I affirm it has much to do with my &s;ubject; for until we learn to di&s;mi&s;s our moral dialect, and high &s;ounding talk of rea&s;on, there will be little right rea&s;on or good morals in the Church; until
<PB N="72" REF="032281_0084_0FF1B298456009A0">we boldly take up the Cro&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and tell mankind that, in religion, there is no other rea&s;on, no other morals, than that godlike rea&s;on, tho&s;e divine morals which He brought down to us from his Father's bo&s;om and trea&s;ured up for us in his holy go&s;pel, we &s;hall never be able to carry on a war of mi&s;&s;ions, nor have apo&s;tolic men to act in it. A mi&s;&s;ion, contemplated in its true &s;pirit, and in all its compa&s;s of &s;acrifice and &s;uffering, is not a common thing, and men who&s;e minds are of a com|mon ca&s;t are unfit for it. If, therefore, their en|gagement is &s;o remote from the common cour&s;e of things, why &s;hould mi&s;&s;ionaries be expected to feel and think in the beaten track? If they are to live in fire, where is the ab&s;urdity of wi&s;hing them to be endowed with the properties of the Salamander? If their work is apo&s;tolic, how is rea&s;on violated by expecting they &s;hould claim alliance with the blood of St. Paul? &mdash; Thanks be to God, his ble&s;|&s;ed Son does not treat the &s;oldiers of the cro&s;s with that contempt they &s;uffer from their fellow Chri&s;tians!

St. Paul indeed was at once made a Chri&s;tian and the chief of the Apo&s;tles. Such power belongeth unto God, and &s;uch honor to the man whom He will exalt. But, in &s;pite of the example and exhortations of the great St. Paul, Mark fled from the work of the apo&s;tolic mi&s;&s;ion; neverthele&s;s, between the whole&s;ome cen&s;ures of Paul, and the con&s;olatory af|fection of Barnabas, his &s;pirit was, through divine grace, again excited to the fight of faith, and he redeemed his character, and obtained a good re|port among the Apo&s;tles. Let the candidate for mi&s;&s;ions be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what degree of zeal and courage he may, no doubt the day will come, when with fears from within and fightings from without, he will be pre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, and feel that nothing but abounding grace and almighty power can con&s;ole and &s;upport him. But, if we mu&s;t make &s;ome abatement for his courage when engag|ed in actual &s;ervice, and jeopardying his life on the high places of the field, &s;urely we &s;hould require &s;ome tolerable degree of ardour before the &s;word is drawn and blood is &s;pilt. For if the man, who volunteers, and is borne on the &s;trong wing of hope, mu&s;t expect &s;uch rude &s;hocks in the evil day, what are we to expect from him who enters into Mi&s;&s;ions without zeal or e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rgy, and who is, in fact, little better than a pre&s;&s;ed man?</P>
<P>The third con&s;ideration which I &s;hall notice as e&s;&s;ential to a call to Mi&s;&s;ions is a freedom from &s;uch ties as exclude the engagement; and they will be either of a dome&s;tic or a mini&s;terial nature. I have more than once expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the propriety of married men and fathers of families engaging in Mi&s;&s;ions. Generally &s;peak|ing I do not think it advi&s;eable; but I dare not &s;ay
<PB N="74" REF="032281_0086_0FF1B29B9C3FA0E0">it is improper. I will not di&s;approve the man &s;o &s;ituated, who &s;hall engage; and, if he and his fa|mily conduct them&s;elves in a mi&s;&s;ion as the Reve|rend Mr. Egede and his hou&s;ehold did in Greenland, they &s;hall have my warme&s;t commendation. Nay, &s;hould they through human weakne&s;s fail in forti|tude and per&s;everance, the piety of the attempt will, with me, cover the weakne&s;s of the execu|tion. But the propriety of &s;uch an attempt will in my idea depend on circum&s;tances. The health, &s;trength, and habits of a mother and her children are to be con&s;idered, as well as the degree of ac|commodation which can be afforded them in a Mi&s;|&s;ion. Much will depend on the willingne&s;s of a mini&s;ter's wife to &s;hare his toils and perils, and very much will depend on his own &s;trength of &s;oul to &s;ee his wife and family, langui&s;hing and dying, if God &s;hould appoint it &s;o, in con&s;equence of his engaging them in difficulties which they cannot &s;upport. If a mini&s;ter be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this forti|tude, if his wife breathes the &s;ame &s;pirit with him&s;elf; and if they both think the venture ju&s;ti|fiable, let them go, and give an example to Chri&s;|tendom which we &s;o greatly want. But if he can|not in&s;pire his wife with his own &s;entiments, I am clearly of opinion he has no call to Mi&s;&s;ions. I rea&s;on thus. If it be &s;aid, that the wife of that mini&s;ter has not piety to engage of her own free will, I an&s;wer Chri&s;tianity will not ju&s;tify a divorce by leaving her behind him, and good &s;en&s;e will not ju&s;tify him to take her abroad into circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s and danger, where all her pa&s;&s;ions will be armed to war again&s;t his peace and to di&s;credit him&s;elf in his mini&s;try. If it be &s;aid, that his wife is a woman of piety, the ca&s;e &s;tands &s;till more &s;trongly again&s;t him, and a dreadful &s;u&s;picion will lie again&s;t his piety. For if a woman of piety, his wife, the mother of his children cannot be made to

The man who does this will find, at la&s;t, that he rolls the &s;tone of Sy&s;iphus, and when he thinks he has got it to the top of the hill, it will return with a double force, acquired by the velocity of its de&s;cent, and cru&s;h him to pieces. If a married man wi&s;hes to engage in mi&s;&s;ions, his fir&s;t care is to in&s;pire his wife with a portion of his own zeal; if he can do &s;o, well; if not I advi&s;e him to &s;lay at home. It is a ba&s;e unmanly thing to complain of our wives; and wo|men were never generally vicious, ba&s;e and cow|ardly, when men did not make them &s;o. Godli|ne&s;s is the mo&s;t commanding thing on earth, and women who have the be&s;t opportunities of know|ing their hu&s;bands piety, and are per&s;onally attach|ed to them, will not be the la&s;t to revere it. The man who charges his wife, in nine ca&s;es out of ten, will reproach him&s;elf; and I affirm when we dare imitate the Apo&s;tles, there is little fear of our wives lagging in the race of virtue.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter's flock &s;hould be as dear to him, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, dearer than his wife and children; and if we are in po&s;ts of uncommon honor and u&s;e|fulne&s;s, it may well admit an enquiry, How far we are ju&s;tifiable in relinqui&s;hing them? We are giving up a certainty for an uncertainty. The good we &s;hall do abroad may bear &s;mall proportion with that we leave at home. We may mi&s;take our call, or we may be called to die, while the ho|nor of conque&s;t is re&s;erved for others. We may, for ought we know, groan for years under the con|&s;equences
<PB N="76" REF="032281_0088_0FF1B2A4D64AE0F0">of a precipitate conduct, and reproach our&s;elves for not having better under&s;tood our Shepherd's voice. What the charity of others may, and &s;hould, lead them to excu&s;e as the error of an hone&s;t zeal, we &s;hall probably charge on our|&s;elves as the proud volatile mi&s;take of an un&s;ancti|fied heart. We may expo&s;e our&s;elves to be the butt of tho&s;e cold &s;pirits who never had religion enough to a&s;pire to excellence; to be admoni&s;hed with ig|norant, but wounding good nature, "I always told you you, "mi&s;took your call, and would &s;oon be glad to come home;" and to be held up as a di&s;|couragement to tho&s;e who would do well&mdash;"Look on that man; he began to build, and "was not able to fini&s;h." We may actually grieve God's &s;pirit; and never recover a po&s;t as u&s;eful in the mini&s;try as that we relinqui&s;hed. And all this may be a very righteous and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline to humble the man, who having only the qualification of a &s;er|jeant in militia, &s;hall a&s;pire to the rank of colonel in a regiment for foreign &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to di&s;courage any man; but I mu&s;t hold out no fal&s;e colors. To have a real call to mi&s;&s;ions is a great honor and a great felicity; but to mi&s;take our call is a &s;ad thing both to our|&s;elves and to others. Nor is there any great dan|ger of my di&s;couraging the man whom God prompts by his &s;pirit to embrace this calling. But &s;ome who are really called may be too ha&s;ty; they may mi&s;take their line of march, or engage before the &s;ignal for engaging be given.

<P>Suppo&s;ing the mi&s;&s;ionary candidate has gone over
<PB N="77" REF="032281_0089_0FF1B2A661BEBF88">all this ground to his &s;atisfaction, the only thing remaining to compleat his call will be a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. To have this rea&s;onable pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s, his mea&s;ures mu&s;t be well con&s;ult|ed, and he mu&s;t be provided with every help, which the nature of the undertaking can require. Let him then a&s;k him&s;elf, Have I funds equal to my undertaking, and are the patrons and conductors of the mi&s;&s;ion in England men of zeal and &s;pirit, &s;uch as I can make perfectly free with, who enter into all my views, and in whom I can perfectly confide, for every encouragement and &s;upport? Do they leave me perfectly at liberty to act abroad as I &s;ee occa&s;ion, not fettering me with cold theoretical councils, and pre&s;cribing with deci&s;ion a line of conduct to me, which amu&s;es them by their fire &s;ide to chat over with a friend? Unle&s;s he can an|&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in a &s;atisfactory manner, his mea&s;ures are not well taken; and if he is zealous in his pur&s;uit he may leave every thing and &s;uffer every thing, to go to India or Japan to &s;ind his hands tied behind his back when he gets there, and to pine away in vexation and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Let him a&s;k farther, Have I fellow &s;oldiers like minded with my&s;elf, and is my mi&s;&s;ion &s;o connect|ed and conducted, that I can have a &s;upply of as ma|ny of them as my work &s;hall require? Have I &s;uch an acquaintance with the country where I am going, of its climate, geography, police and man|ners, as I can rea&s;onably expect to an&s;wer upon a trial with tho&s;e views which have engaged me to go there? If he goes alone be &s;hould be a man of no little &s;tatute. Though he &s;hould live and die like David Brainerd, he will in that ca&s;e only relinqui&s;h a greater good in England to do a &s;maller one abroad. Where a tolerable number of Mi&s;&s;iona|ries are wanting a few individuals may be converted; but the go&s;pel will not be &s;pread&mdash;nothing will be
<PB N="78" REF="032281_0090_0FF1B2A99BBA3888">done an&s;werable to the idea of a mi&s;&s;ion. And I confe&s;s I can &s;ee no rea&s;on for marching through fire and water to convert a Bramin in India, when with half the labor ten of our own countrymen might be converted at home; except it be to keep up the dying flame of mi&s;&s;ionary zeal, until Chri&s;|tendom be &s;hamed out of the folly of conducting Mi&s;&s;ions in this lazy, ab&s;urd way. On the other hand, &s;hould our information of the place we are going to be defective, we &s;hall proceed on fal&s;e principles, and when practice is di&s;covered to be &s;o oppo&s;ite to our theory, we &s;hall be liable to turn on the heel, and &s;ay, this is not the place to which I am called.</P>
<P>When a mini&s;ter has patiently examined the&s;e four topics, his ability, his willingne&s;s, his free|dom from tho&s;e ties which prohibit the engagement, and the rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding, and finds them all concurring to countenance the pur&s;uit, he will I think be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing which ought to be de&s;ired, or can be obtained to make his call clear. He has nothing then to do, but to obey the dictates of his con&s;cience, and, ca&s;ting his care upon the Lord, to make trial of his apo&s;tle&s;hip. If he is ble&s;&s;ed in his deed, he &s;hall &s;ee of the tra|vail of his Redeemer's &s;oul, and of his own, and be &s;atisfied. His example will provoke his breth|ren to jealou&s;y, and his &s;ucce&s;s encourage our ex|ertions. If he &s;ails, he will di&s;courage no man who does not with to be di&s;couraged. He may come home, and tell his Brethren ingenuou&s;ly. <Q>I have made the attempt and find my&s;elf inade|quate to it. Neverthele&s;s, the foundation abi|deth firm, the obligation of the duty is the &s;ame, and do you who have more wi&s;dom and piety &s;tand forward as the Champions of Chri&s;t and his religion. Let no man's heart fail on my ac|count; nor &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e I have done nothing,
<PB N="79" REF="032281_0091_0FF1B2AFE7DD23A0">that nothing is to be done by the many veterans who fight under the cro&s;s. You cen&s;ure my ra&s;hne&s;s, you chide my pu&s;illanimity, and it is of little matter that my character &s;ink under a weight of reproach which in many re&s;pects I have de&s;erved: but do you ari&s;e and be jealous for your God.

Go, and redeem the honor I have lo&s;t. Wipe away this vile di&s;grace, this unutterable &s;hame, which re&s;ts upon the Chri&s;tian name. Let it not be &s;aid that in the eighteenth century, in Britain, among the thou&s;ands of mini&s;ters of various de|nominations who are the glory of the Churches, that men are not to be found who feel for man, Chri&s;tians who are not jealous for Chri&s;t's glory, mini&s;ters who cheri&s;h the noble emulation of fol|lowing the apo&s;tles.

<P>Next to the ine&s;timable and irreparable lo&s;s of his own &s;oul in attempting to &s;ave the &s;ouls of others, perhaps the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;hock a mi&s;&s;ionary can have to &s;upport, far wor&s;e than death, is that of total di&s;appointment, together with a di&s;covery of having mi&s;taken his object. Yet to this total di&s;appointment, to this dreadful di&s;covery, is every man liable who engages in Mi&s;&s;ions. This reflec|tion &s;hould guard us again&s;t precipitate determina|tion; and teach us to meet di&s;appointments half way. When we are &s;oaring in the clouds, we &s;hould often bring our&s;elves to the ground, by &s;aying to our&s;elves," Perhaps I "may be mi&s;taken in my call&mdash;perhaps the mo&s;t cruel "di&s;appointments await me." Such thoughts are the more needful as men of fire, and &s;uch mi&s;&s;ionaries will be, par|ticularly need them. Too often we deceive our|&s;elves by &s;uppo&s;ing con&s;titutional vivacity is Chri&s;|tian zeal; and, though we indulge the&s;e humbling con&s;iderations to con&s;olidate our &s;pirits, as much as po&s;&s;ible, if di&s;appointment be at la&s;t our por|tion, we &s;hall find it hard enough to &s;upport the dreadful concu&s;&s;ion when it comes. Few men of candid minds are wholly blind to con&s;titutional fail|ings; and if the mi&s;&s;ionary be &s;en&s;ible that his de|fect leans to the &s;ide of fal&s;e fire, it will be doubly nece&s;&s;ary for him to labor after the &s;tronger quali|ties of gravity, firmne&s;s, and &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to go forth in utramque paratus to win trophies, or to &s;upport the di&s;grace inevitably con&s;equent on an
<PB N="81" REF="032281_0093_0FF1B2B302B1C9F0">un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt. Should a mi&s;&s;ionary &s;pirit be generally excited, many, who mean well, will be induced to venture, who, upon the trial, will find their &s;trength in&s;ufficient for an apo&s;tolic warfare. They mu&s;t, then, either relinqui&s;h the war, or per&s;i&s;t in it to their own ruin. In this dilemma, the man of feeling, honor, &s;pirit, may find &s;uch a quantum of pride, &s;elf confidence, and impatience, in his compo&s;ition, as he never before &s;u&s;pected. His feeling, his &s;en&s;e of honor, his &s;pirit, which, with a &s;hare of godline&s;s, were perhaps the &s;ecret &s;prings of his engagement, will now turn their &s;trength upon him&s;elf, excruciate him beyond imagination, and, if God's infinite compa&s;&s;ions do not prevent him, and enable him to &s;ink quietly into his own nothingne&s;s at the feet of Je&s;us, he will become the prey of that proud &s;orrow, which, in &s;cripture language, is &s;aid <HI>to work death;</HI> or, in the phra&s;eology of this world, <HI>be will break his heart.</HI> The man who is <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> to engage in mi&s;&s;ions is free from this danger; but he who, with the &s;emblance of apo&s;tolic zeal, without deep humility, meekne&s;s and patience, falls into this circum&s;tance, will experience a hurricane of pa&s;&s;i|ons, which beggars all de&s;cription. Much of this I have known too well; and I make this confe&s;&s;ion, that my readers may learn, that I make a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and important di&s;tinction, between a well tempered zeal, and that &s;pecies of fire which betrays levity and incon&s;tancy of mind.</P>
<P>One more ob&s;ervation I &s;hall make on this &s;ub|ject. if we would not di&s;courage Mi&s;&s;ions, we mu&s;t beware how we indulge the a&s;perity of cen|&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e who fail in their attempts. They have paid the penalty of their ra&s;hne&s;s, as fully as any man of humanity could wi&s;h. We &s;hould remember, it is ea&s;ier to attempt great things than to accompli&s;h them; and if to the proud humilia|tions
<PB N="82" REF="032281_0094_0FF1B2B562C13398">of a man's own mind, and tho&s;e kindlier one's of God's good &s;pirit, this poor dejected mortal is to be reprehended, ridiculed, or, under the pretence of pity, to be the object of the vile contempt of ba&s;e minds, who will engage in great and perilous undertakings? Let Chri&s;tians, then, imitate the dignity of a Roman Senate, and, in&s;tead of cen|&s;uring what thou&s;ands can cen&s;ure, and few da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e imitate, treat &s;uch a one with a generous conde|&s;cen&s;ion which may &s;u&s;tain his mind under affliction, and encourage others to bold attempts to &s;erve a grateful people.</P>
<P>After all, as real Chri&s;tians are few and fal&s;e ones many, he who becomes a mi&s;&s;ionary mu&s;t ex|pect what he will certainly find&mdash;contempt and op|po&s;ition all the way through; and though it be our duty to treat him in the way I recommend, it is evidently his duty to &s;trive after that lowline&s;s of &s;oul, which &s;etting it&s;elf under the eye of God, is neither elated with the prai&s;e, nor dejected by the cen&s;ure of men. In learning of Je&s;us to be meek and lowly in heart, we &s;hall find &s;olid and permanent re&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF we would &s;ee a general &s;pread of the go&s;pel and multitudes of ignorant Heathen gathered into the &s;old of Chri&s;t, we &s;hould endeavor to mend the mi&s;&s;ionary road and to remove from it all unnece&s;&s;ary turnpikes: we &s;hould con&s;ider the ob|jections, which are made to Mi&s;&s;ions, and, by giv|ing them &s;atisfactory an&s;wers, &s;hake off tho&s;e fatal di&s;couragements, which counteract our exertions. I beg leave to lay before you &s;uch of them as have fallen under my notice, together with &s;uch an&s;wers as I have made to my &s;everal objectors.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t trite objection thrown in the teeth of the man, who &s;peaks in favor of Mi&s;&s;ions, is, <HI>We have Heathens enough in England, without cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea to find them. Convert tho&s;e we have at home fir&s;t and then look to tho&s;e abroad.</HI>&mdash;This objec|tion reminds me of the language of our Lord, when a&s;&s;uming the cold, &s;evere air of the Phari&s;ee, he made a trial of the faith of the Syro-phoeni|cean woman, who reque&s;ted a cure for her daugh|ter.&mdash;<HI>It is not meet to take the children's brean, and give it to dogs.</HI> And I think it may be well an|&s;wered by the words of the afflicted mother, <HI>Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the children's table.</HI> If our Lord may decide the point, there was rea&s;on, as well as faith, in her plea. That there are Heathens in England is a melancholy truth; and it will be equally true, when Chri&s;t &s;hall come to judge the world, as it is at this day. So that, if we wait their conver&s;ion,
<PB N="84" REF="032281_0096_0FF1B2BE70F4A760">the Heathens abroad will never be the better for our love. But, it &s;hould be remembered, that our European Heathens peri&s;h by the abu&s;e of that knowlege, for the lack of which other Heathens are undone. I add, that the Mini&s;ters who go abroad, &s;o far from being felt as a lo&s;s at home, will be the means of doing more good among us, than if they had continued in England. For foreign Mi&s;&s;ions will have the &s;ame influence on religion, as foreign commerce has upon agriculture and ma|nufactures. As Chri&s;tianity prevails abroad, &s;o it will flouri&s;h at home. Thus, what is alledged again&s;t Mi&s;&s;ions is a &s;ub&s;tantial argument for engag|in them.</P>
<P>Others object, <HI>I know not that God's time for the conver&s;ion of the Heathens be yet come. When St. Paul would have gone into A&s;ia, he was inhi|bited by the &s;pirit; and if St. Paul was mi&s;taken in &s;uch a point, well may we be &s;o al&s;o.</HI>&mdash;I an&s;wer if my objector means to prove any thing, he &s;hould advance a &s;tep farther, and &s;ay <HI>I know that God's time is not come; and becau&s;e St. Paul was forbidden in the cour&s;e of his journey to preach the go&s;pel in A&s;ia before he had vi&s;ited Macedonia and Greece, (which were riper for receiving the go&s;pel,) therefore, Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not follow the Apo&s;tle's example, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, peradventure, they &s;hould act under the inhibitions of the &s;pirit</HI>&mdash;But is <HI>I don't know,</HI> in the lips of any man, to be oppo&s;ed to the authoritative command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Go, preach the go&s;pel to every creature?</HI> And is it come to this, that eighteen hundred years after the death of Chri&s;t, and notwith&s;tanding the general opinion of the Church evinced, by her engaging, more or le&s;s, in Mi&s;&s;ions, from that time to this, that we are in doubt about our Ma&s;ter's will on a &s;ubject, which involves the &s;alvation of &s;o large a part of mankind? If this be the ca&s;e, how are we
<PB N="85" REF="032281_0097_0FF1B2C000CAC240">to know God's will? What mu&s;t the Maje&s;ty of Heaven do to &s;atisfy our unrea&s;onable &s;pirits? <HI>An evil and adulterous generation &s;eek for &s;igns.</HI> Our &s;cruples &s;tamp our character&mdash;St. Paul's inhibition proves the very point I contend for&mdash;that we &s;hould act under the warrant of a general commi&s;&s;ion. St. Paul did &s;o. As a man of &s;en&s;e he made u&s;e of his rea&s;on. He had undoubtedly &s;pecious rea|&s;ons for thinking of going fir&s;t into A&s;ia; but God, who &s;aw farther than he did, ordered him to take another route, and after he had fulfilled that mini&s;try, he re&s;umed his de&s;ign to go into A&s;ia and &s;pent a con&s;iderable time there, his labors be|ing accompanied with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s which attend|ed him in other parts. We read of none of the Apo&s;tles looking for <HI>particular</HI> intimations of the divine will to direct their labors. Sometimes they had extraordinary intimations, and they obeyed them; but, in their general cour&s;e, after prayer and &s;erious deliberation, they did what appeared to them the mo&s;t advi&s;eable. La&s;tly, I a&s;k why are we, in religion, to contravene every principle of common &s;en&s;e, upon which we act in all other things? Let us do our duty, and cea&s;e to move the councils of Heaven for the knowlege of what the Almighty is determined to conceal. Were St. Paul on earth, and an angel from heaven were to preach the doctrine contained in the objection, I am confident, the Apo&s;tle would &s;trip him of his luminous apparel, and lay his doctrine under an anathema, in all the Churches.</P>
<P>An objection, &s;imilar to the one I have ju&s;t an|&s;wered, is urged in the following form&mdash;<HI>It appears that the order of events we are taught to expect from the Prophecies, is fir&s;t the de&s;truction of the Roman Antichri&s;t, then the conver&s;ion of the Jews, and, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of all, the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles; in which work, the converted Jews, it is thought,
<PB N="86" REF="032281_0098_0FF1B2FD25BB4958">will be the principal in&s;truments. The conclu&s;ion is, that the time is not yet come for the conver&s;ion of the Heathens, and that all our labor to effect it will be lo&s;t.</HI> To this rea&s;oning, I an&s;wer fir&s;t, that pro|phecies comparatively ob&s;cure &s;hould not be put in competition with the obligation of clear and expli|cit precepts. Secondly, if all be granted which this objection a&s;&s;umes, it will not follow that we &s;hould look for the grand events we hope to &s;ee accompli&s;hed, in indolence and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. If none but Jewi&s;h Chri&s;tians dare &s;ignalize their zeal for truth in the apo&s;tolic way, nor are to be ho|nored with apo&s;tolic &s;ucce&s;s, much, very much may yet be done by us, long before we &s;hall &s;ee righteou&s;ne&s;s covering the earth, as the waters do the face of the deep. How does my object or know, whether the Lord may not make u&s;e of the zeal of &s;incere Chri&s;tians in &s;preading his Go&s;pel, as one principal means of converting the Jews? And how many Millions may there not be brought to God, before the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles &s;hall come in? We are told that our religion &s;hall have a general &s;pread, an univer&s;al prevalence in the world, and we are commanded to preach the Go&s;|pel to every creature: but in&s;tead of occupying our talent with faithfulne&s;s, we fairly bury it be|cau&s;e it is not ten. Becau&s;e the time may not yet be come for the grand conver&s;ion of mankind, we take it for granted, that the day is not come for the conver&s;ion of any of them; and becau&s;e we do not hope for apo&s;tolic &s;ucce&s;s, we determine ab&s;olutely to do nothing at all. But &s;hall tho&s;e &s;ervants be pronounced ble&s;&s;ed, whom the Lord &s;hall find &s;o do|ing?</P>
<P>A third objection ari&s;es from the difficulty of the undertaking. <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries at this day,</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>have difficulties to &s;truggle with, which are altoge|ther in&s;uperable; nor can men and money be rai&s;ed equal to &s;uch exten&s;ive undertakings.</HI> I grant, if we
<PB N="87" REF="032281_0099_0FF1B2C313098130">put Omnipotence out of the que&s;tion, we have little encouragement to engage in this war. But, I al&s;o in&s;i&s;t, that the in&s;uperable difficulties &s;poken of exi&s;t only in our own cowardice. The Je&s;uits &s;urmounted them all. The Moravians have done the &s;ame. And other men, who will imitate their intrepidity, will be equally &s;ucce&s;sful. Nor are the &s;ums of money nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e undertakings &s;o great as may be imagined.</P>
<P>When we have proper mi&s;&s;ionaries and have learned to conduct our Mi&s;&s;ions aright, the expence attending them will be greatly dimini&s;hed. Were as large a &s;um as fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum expended in Mi&s;&s;ions, what a trifle would a &s;ingle million of money be in the cour&s;e of twenty years, to be rai&s;ed among the Chri&s;tians of England? And while we pay fourteen or fifteen millions an|nually for the advantage of civil government, what a &s;mall offering is fifty thou&s;and pounds to our Immortal Sovereign for all the ble&s;&s;ings of his divine religion? Say thet the &s;um of thirty five thou&s;and pounds bounded our benevolence to our Heathen brethren, this would be one million in thirty years. Certainly this money would be in|comparably better &s;pent than the millions con&s;umed in one year's war! In the la&s;t year a &s;ub&s;cription of more than twenty thou&s;and pounds was given to the emigrant mini&s;ters of the Gallican Church; and immen&s;e &s;ums are laid out on the &s;upport of our poor, every year. I heartily approve of this way of &s;pending our money; but may I not a&s;k, Is the &s;pread of Chri&s;t's religion a matter of common cha|rity, that we &s;hould part with money for Mi&s;&s;ions with as much reluctance as we would part with our blood; and think forty or fifty thou&s;and pounds, which a &s;ew Gentlemen of fortune cane afford to throw away on their plea&s;ures every year, too large a &s;um to be applied to the fir&s;t, the greate&s;t, and
<PB N="88" REF="032281_0100_0FF1B2C6122ED4B8">mo&s;t obligatory charity under heaven? And yet by the expenditure of the &s;um I have mentioned might thou&s;ands of Heathen, every year, be brought from darkne&s;s into light, and turned from the power of Satan to the &s;ervice of God.</P>
<P>The want of men is the la&s;t thing to be feared. There exi&s;ts, at this day, in England, a greater number of men who wi&s;h for this employment, than can well be imagined. They are to be found among all Denominations. Let us but enquire after them and they will appear. But &s;o long as Mi&s;&s;ions are di&s;couraged and vilified, few of them will brand them&s;elves for enthu&s;ia&s;ts, by expre&s;|&s;ing great forwardne&s;s, and becoming <HI>candidates</HI> for them.</P>
<P>It will &s;till be objected that, <HI>Facts do not ju&s;tify the&s;e &s;anguine hopes; for no fruit has yet been de|rived from Mi&s;&s;ions, worth the money, and toil, and valuable lives, which have been expended on them; and which might have been applied to better purpo&s;e in Europe.</HI> I an&s;wer, the facts alluded to, prove nothing but that Mi&s;&s;ions have been very improperly conducted; and, that if they are not taken up with more &s;pirit, they are by no means likely to an&s;wer their end. But, I in&s;i&s;t, that the fruit with which they have been attended, proves undeniably what <HI>may be done,</HI> when we exert our|&s;elves as we ought to do. I in&s;i&s;t, farther, that tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ions though unproductive, are very ju&s;ti|fiable, and have an&s;wered valuable purpo&s;es. They are ju&s;ti&s;iable; for the men who have acted in them have done their duty, re&s;pected their con&s;cien|ces, felt for humanity, proved their faith, a&s;&s;erted the honor of their religion, and glorified the vera|city, faithfulne&s;s and power of God. It &s;hall not avail that the world brands their-lives with madne&s;s, and e&s;teems their deaths without honor. Wi&s;dom will ju&s;tify her children. They have been
<PB N="89" REF="032281_0101_0FF1B2C92D62BA88"><HI>wi&s;e,</HI> ina&s;much as they have been <HI>faithful;</HI> for there is no man, who hath left father or mother, or hou&s;e or lands, or friends or country, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, who &s;hall not receive an hundred fold in the kingdom of God. They have al&s;o an|&s;wered valuable ends. They will ju&s;tify the ways of God to men, in the day of final account, and &s;erve to illu&s;trate his my&s;terious providence. They will condemn the Chri&s;tian world of unbelief. They will have given a great example to us, as hav|ing cho&s;en affliction, not with the people of God, but with poor Heathens, in preference to all the riches and honors of Egypt. When Chri&s;tendom lay a&s;leep, they alone heard the &s;ound of arms, and joined the ble&s;&s;ed Captain of their &s;alvation on the plains of Indo&s;tan, and in the fro&s;ts and &s;nows of Greenland and Labrador. Like Abraham they went forth to a far country; and though the ac|compli&s;hment of the promi&s;e has not been unto them, yet, like that venerable Patriarch they have &s;een Chri&s;t's day and rejoiced. In the veracity of the promi&s;es, they have &s;een his &s;eed numerous as the &s;ands on the &s;ea &s;hore, and re&s;plendent as the &s;tars of heaven. They have obtained a good re|port through faith, and their bones, like tho&s;e of Jacob and Jo&s;eph, have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land of our inheritance. They re&s;t in glorious hope; and though no proud Mau&s;oleum of theirs attracts the eye of man, prone to gaze with fal&s;e wonder on earthly pageants, yet Angels in amicable con|ver&s;e will point out each hallowed &s;pot, and read the general epitaph&mdash;<HI>The&s;e were men of whom the world was not worthy!</HI> They plead the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t with us, nor &s;hall they <HI>always</HI> plead in vain. Their voices &s;hall be heard, and all Europe &s;hall obey their call. They are the forerunners of the armies of Emanuel, and their labors the welcome drops which promi&s;e plenteous rain. Until this is
<PB N="90" REF="032281_0102_0FF1B2CC5D312CD0">brought to pa&s;s, they have the honor to keep alive the &s;pirit of Mi&s;&s;ions; and will claim a large &s;hare in the victories of tho&s;e, who &s;hall come after them.</P>
<P>Some pious men can indulge no hope of &s;ucce&s;s in Mi&s;&s;ions, <HI>while the wickedne&s;s of Europeans ope|rates to prejudice the Heathen again&s;t the go&s;pel.</HI> We lament the fatal operation of prejudices which ari&s;e from that quarter, but think they are pre&s;&s;ed beyond all bounds of truth. No people were more prejudiced again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, nor had more dread|ful cau&s;e to be &s;o, than the poor Indians of Califor|nia and Paraguay; but their prejudices yielded to the force of rea&s;on, and the per&s;evering benevo|lence of the Je&s;uits. Truth is great and will pre|vail. No men are &s;o bruti&s;h as not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between a friend and an enemy; and fierce lions have been &s;ubdued by the blandi&s;hments of gentle, human kindne&s;s. Beyond all this we mu&s;t look to the ble&s;&s;ing of the God we &s;erve, and the almighty grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. To hope the be&s;t is pious and wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Many Morali&s;ts, who, though bred up in the common forms and principles of Chri&s;tianity, know not how to value their religion, object, <HI>The death of Chri&s;t was a common &s;acrifice; his good &s;pirit is given to all men; and if the Heathens obey the ad|monitions of the Spirit; they will be accepted through the merits of the Redeemer's death. Why not, then, leave them to their equitable Judge, who having given them but one talent, will not require from them the improvement of ten.</HI>&mdash;God will certainly judge them equitably, and will not ex|pect to reap what he has not &s;own. We grant al&s;o, that a Heathen may be &s;aved without an explicit revelation of the go&s;pel, though not without &s;anc|tification of the &s;pirit and the &s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us. But this does not prove, that the
<PB N="91" REF="032281_0103_0FF1B2CED8667D90">go&s;pel is not an ine&s;timable gift; or that it is not out duty to carry it to them. Farther, I an&s;wer que&s;tion with que&s;tion; and a&s;k, if a man in Eng|land may be &s;aved, though he cannot read his bi|ble, what need is there of his being able to read it? If &s;imple reading be &s;ufficient, what need is there of liberal education? If man may live on bread and water, what need of a profu&s;ion of meats and drinks? If the blind may travel from one part of the kingdom to another, by the humble helps of his dog and &s;taff, what can there be de&s;irable in vi|&s;ion, and all the accomodations of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, carriages, and good roads? Not to pre&s;s my objector with a hundred more &s;uch que&s;tions, I affirm, that Chri&s;|tianity gives a perfection to man which &s;ets him al|mo&s;t on a level with angels; and, that the &s;piritual knowlege and piety of a Confucius or a Socrates, is no more to be compared with the attainments of the meane&s;t child of God under the di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t, than the knowlege of a Hottentot is to be weighed again&s;t the cultivated rea&s;on of a Newton.</P>
<P>The la&s;t objection, I &s;hall notice, is of a more unequivocal nature than all the re&s;t. <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries are a di&s;grace to any nation. Their attempts are highly dangerous; for &s;hould they &s;ucceed in intro|ducing Chri&s;tianity into the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, it would produce revolt in our Colonies, and &s;ubvert the Briti&s;h empire in Indo&s;tan.</HI> This objection has in &s;ub&s;tance been urged in a Briti&s;h Parliament, in the We&s;t India I&s;lands, and in the debates of the India Directors. I confe&s;s, I know not how to meet it in the way of argument. The men who make it are as un&s;it judges of Chri&s;tianity as the blind are of colors; and are as much di&s;po&s;ed to re|ceive conviction from rea&s;oning, as rocks are di&s;|po&s;ed to weep over human mi&s;eries. As the &s;er|vant of the Lord however I &s;hall be told I mu&s;t be meek. Be it &s;o. The objection is either true or
<PB N="92" REF="032281_0104_0FF1B2D3822F4F98">fal&s;e. If it be true,&mdash;if the Doctrine of Chri&s;t does really tend to produce revolt, and to &s;ubvert empires, let us open our arms to French Athei&s;m. Let us renounce this religion of blood, which cur&s;|es the world with everla&s;ting di&s;orders and conten|tions; and rejoice that we have lived to a day, when the endle&s;s whirl of elements and atoms has produced &s;uch noble di&s;coveries. Let us deify the fieud Marat; and let us tell all our worthy coun|trymen, who pick pockets, cut throats, and delight in &s;uch ingenuous arts, that they may di&s;mi&s;s all fears of vengeance from the crucified man of Na|zareth.&mdash; But Chri&s;tianity never did produce re|volt and &s;ubver&s;ion of empires. It has <HI>no tendency</HI> to produce the&s;e dreadful con&s;equences. If indeed it were propo&s;ed to &s;end forth booted Apo&s;tles, to convert the nations by fire and &s;word, the objec|tion would a&s;&s;ume the color of truth, <HI>and only the color of truth;</HI> for no unprejudiced man, who ever read the go&s;pel would dignify &s;uch mi&s;&s;ionaries with the epithet of <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI> If on the other hand the objection be fal&s;e, it can merit no an&s;wer but that of indignant &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid the&s;e apprehen&s;ions do not ori|ginate in any tendency which the religion of Chri&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to have to operate the&s;e effects, but in the accidental abu&s;e to which it is liable from the ig|norant zeal of mi&s;&s;ionaries, the implacable re&s;ent|ments of Slaves, and the bigotted &s;uper&s;tition of the inhabitants of India, which would render them jealous of innovations in their religion, a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer may be given on all the&s;e heads. Mi&s;&s;iona|ries can promi&s;e them&s;elves no advantage from ex|citing revolt from the Government which protects them. None but good men will engage in Mi&s;&s;i|ons, and they mu&s;t abhor every doctrine which di&s;turbs the peace of &s;ociety. But a &s;mall &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e, and of acquaintance with their bi|bles,
<PB N="93" REF="032281_0105_0FF1B2D69DCA4FF0">will teach them the nece&s;&s;ity of enforcing on their converts, that &s;alutary doctrine, which St. Paul taught to the numerous &s;laves of the Roman empire&mdash;<HI>Let as many &s;ervants, as are under the yoke, count their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;|phemed.</HI> Had the Apo&s;tle preached other doctrine, he would have armed one half of the world again&s;t the other, and excited in&s;urrections and ma&s;&s;acres throughout the empire, in which the &s;laves were nearly as numerous as the freemen. But, if any mi&s;&s;ionary be blind to this whole&s;ome doctrine of the Scripture, and if he be deaf to the con&s;equen|ces of preaching otherwi&s;e, which he will not fail to hear from every quarter, let the laws claim the penalty of his ra&s;hne&s;s. We will not exclaim that religion is violated by his puni&s;hment; and, we expect in return, that the doctrine of God be not bla&s;phemed, and &s;ober minded mi&s;&s;ionaries vilified, for the dangerous folly of a few hot headed men.</P>
<P>I have not heard that any bad con&s;equences have ari&s;en in our Colonies from the labors of the Mora|vian and Methodi&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries; and I am in hopes that the fears of my We&s;t Indian countrymen are now pretty well calmed on that head. They now begin to feel the advantage of their mini&s;try, and invite them to labor among their &s;laves. When once tho&s;e poor creatures are made real Chri&s;tians, they almo&s;t forget that they are &s;laves. They ble&s;s God for that afflictive providence, which tore them from their native land, and all the cha|rities of life, &s;ince it has placed them in circum|&s;tances favorable to the knowlege of Chri&s;t, and the &s;alvation of their immortal &s;ouls. The awful prohibitions of Chri&s;tianity not only wre&s;t the dagger from their hands, but deprive them of the inclination to u&s;e it. In&s;tead of execrating their enemies, the love of Chri&s;t compels them to ble&s;s
<PB N="94" REF="032281_0106_0FF1B2D82F156BC8">and pray for them. Such are the effects, with many others highly beneficial, which &s;low, natur|ally and nece&s;&s;arily, from the introduction of gen|uine Chri&s;tianity into our colonies.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid of the influence of religion in the We&s;t Indies, will equally apply to the Bri|ti&s;h Empire in India. We grant jealou&s;ies may po&s;&s;ibly be excited among the Natives by the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, e&s;pecially among the Mahomedans, who&s;e religion con&s;iders it as meri|torious to make war on all mi&s;believers. But, when I reflect on the general character of the na|tives of Indo&s;tan, I cannot believe any in&s;urrections on that account very probable. If the Briti&s;h power there &s;hould &s;uffer &s;omething in the attempt, the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt mu&s;t give it a &s;tability which it has not yet felt. And if the ambition and avarice of the India Company do not one day ruin their affairs, there is no rea&s;on to fear that the God, at who&s;e command empires ri&s;e and fall, will overturn their empire for the damnable crimes of countenancing truth, piety, and benevolence. If India Directors are too far gone in earthly policy to attend to the&s;e rea&s;onings, we need not their &s;ervices. In Calcutta we dare a&s;&s;ert the liberties of Englishmen, and the right of Chri&s;t's &s;ervants to preach the go&s;pel to every creature. If tho&s;e li|berties are refu&s;ed, and that right is laughed at, I hope the Ea&s;t will &s;oon be filled with mi&s;&s;ionaries, who dare &s;uffer any thing which the Governors of India dare inflict, and who, under the fierce&s;t fire of per&s;ecution, &s;hall &s;pread, on every &s;ide, the light of the Glory of God, in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Having run over this &s;tring of objections, and, as I hope, given them a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, I beg leave for a moment to call your attention to a con&s;i|deration not irrelevant to the &s;ubject of Mi&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Is nothing to be done for the millions who groan
<PB N="95" REF="032281_0107_0FF1B2DB4BF04258">under the iron rod of Antichri&s;t? Will it be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters to give to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for not declaring the truth of the go&s;pel in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, that there are inqui&s;itions in tho&s;e countries, and that our lives mu&s;t be the forfeiture of doing our duty? Would not the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in the early ages, have blu&s;hed at &s;uch a plea? What is become of the zeal which actuated our forefathers at the Reformation? Italy abounds with Materi|ali&s;ts and Athei&s;ts. Even in Spain and Portugal, the gloomie&s;t regions of hateful &s;uper&s;tition, there is rea&s;on to believe that many thou&s;ands would give a hearty reception to the Prote&s;tant doctrine. Rome is now defended by Briti&s;h valor. Her Mini&s;ters, who in their turn, fall under the edge of that &s;word, which they once wielded until it was drunk with Prote&s;tant blood, may have learn|ed moderation from their &s;ufferings. Fo&s;tered in the benevolent bo&s;oms of Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants, wit|ne&s;&s;ing a &s;erious regard to religion in this country, which they could hardly believe exi&s;ted among us, and ob&s;erving the fraternal love which unites us, and is the happy con&s;equence of mutual toleration, may we not hope that this is a favorable time for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, with candor and benevolence, the grand truths in di&s;pute between the Roman and Prote&s;|tant Communions? Chri&s;tendom is now weary of the Papal yoke. It has been too long mi&s;taken by many for the ea&s;y yoke of Je&s;us; and while they revolt from Rome, they at the &s;ame time renounce allegiance to God, and his Chri&s;t. Are no means, then, to be u&s;ed to remedy the&s;e dreadful evils, but that of the exterminating &s;word? Surely much may be expected from rational controver&s;y. Our books may be circulated through Europe, and they will convey the be&s;t antidote to tho&s;e poi&s;onous publications, whereby French Athei&s;ts are over|turning
<PB N="96" REF="032281_0108_0FF1B2DFC4D4C160">religion, morals, and government in the world. The rea&s;ons, which vindicate the proprie|ty of exhorting you to undertake Mi&s;&s;ions among Heathens, will evince the nece&s;&s;ity of doing the &s;ame among the catholics and the followers of Mahomet. And may we not believe, that God will take it well at our hands, before his judgments wholly overwhelm Babylon, if we give a loud and affectionate call to all who fear God, in any degree, among her &s;ons, to flee from the evil to come, and to relinqui&s;h her Communion, before &s;he &s;inks in avenging fire?</P>
<P>Earne&s;tly be&s;eeching the God of all mercy, to give us in all the&s;e re&s;pects, and in every thing el&s;e which involves our duty and faithfulne&s;s, as Stew|ards of the my&s;teries of Chri&s;t, an hone&s;t and en|lightened judgment.</P>

<HEAD>EIGHTH LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a former letter, I endeavored to excite your zeal by &s;etting before you the example of the Apo&s;tles. In the pre&s;ent letter, I &s;hall attempt to call forth the &s;entiments of &s;hame, indignation, and &s;elf contempt, by reminding you of the conduct of the children of this world, whom our Lord pronounces wi&s;er in their generation than the chil|dren of light.</P>
<P>Their &s;uperior wi&s;dom is &s;een in the agreement of their principles and practices; in the fitne&s;s of the means they employ to the ends they would ac|compli&s;h; in the boldne&s;s and comprehen&s;ion of their plans; and in the policy, energy, and per&s;e|verance, with which they effect their purpo&s;es. Nor is this to be wondered at. They are <HI>children of the world.</HI> They live in their own element; and breathe a congenial air. Familiarly conver|&s;ant with the objects around them, they tread a beaten path, and animate each other by their num|bers and their &s;houts. Their principles originate in their nature, are &s;trengthened by early habits, &s;harpened by education, and receive their perfec|tion from that grand &s;cience the knowlege of life, in which they find the major part of all ranks ap|proving, avowing, vindicating, applauding, and acting upon principles &s;imilar to their own. They di&s;cover their leading intere&s;t with in&s;tinctive &s;aga|city, and hunt down their prey with the fiercene&s;s of the lion, or the crafty doublings of the fox.</P>
<P>With the children of light, who dwell in the
<PB N="98" REF="032281_0110_0FF1B2E481AE5028">mid&s;t of darkne&s;s, it is far otherwi&s;e. Their prin|ciples, &s;pirit, and manners, have little affinity with tho&s;e of the world; and they are naturally de&s;pi&s;|ed, hated, and ridiculed by her children. As &s;trangers, they traver&s;e an unknown country; as pilgrims, they enjoy few accommodations; and as &s;oldiers, they tread on ho&s;tile ground, and fight their way with difficulty. Too often, di&s;couraged by the &s;everity of their warfare, and the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of their exile, they wi&s;h for the wings of the dove, that they might flee away, and be at re&s;t. With implacable re&s;entments the God of this world and his armies pur&s;ue them, as the fugitives of his kingdom; and, what is wor&s;t of all, they carry in their own brea&s;ts traitors, who would per&s;uade them to return from the fatigues of the wilderne&s;s to the fle&s;h pots of Egypt. Their old man &s;trug|gles again&s;t the new one, inveterate habits recur, and the &s;tubborn principles of earthly policy, at one time, re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;dom which cometh from above, and, at another, modify and accommodate it to the intere&s;ts of the fle&s;h. Hence religion &s;its aukwardly upon us. Hence our purpo&s;es are bro|ken off, po&s;tponed, or executed with a timidity and &s;upinene&s;s, which deprive them of half their ef|fect, and indicate that they po&s;&s;e&s;s but half our hearts.</P>
<P>But, if the children of this world often &s;educe us to evil, they al&s;o afford us many admirable le&s;|&s;ons how to do well. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we may learn much from them; and from the monarch to the pea&s;ant their conduct in their re&s;pective &s;ta|tions, will &s;hame the cowardice and inactivity of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t ca&s;t our eyes on the ma&s;s of men, &s;oldiers, &s;ailors, laborers, and low mechanics, who are called plebeians, the vulgar, the rabble, the herd. The&s;e poor men toil to extreme la&s;&s;i|tude,
<PB N="99" REF="032281_0111_0FF1B2E8F9C8A5F8">allay the cravings of hunger with coar&s;e and &s;canty diet, &s;hun neither hard&s;hip nor danger in their occupations, accelerate the approach of age and decrepitude, and have their feelings tortured with the in&s;olence of command, and the varied &s;cenes of dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;s attendant on poverty. Thou&s;ands of them are continually cru&s;hed in mines, burnt in furnaces, immerged in waters, poi&s;oned, &s;laughtered, wracked to death with rheu|mati&s;m, or pine away in con&s;umption. Ten thou|&s;and fatal ca&s;ualties are daily hurrying them into eternity. Yet they do not complain, but are con|tent and cheerful. With manly firmne&s;s, they &s;up|port the load of life, and calmly tread the path which conducts them to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd. For &s;ix pence a day, the &s;oldier expo&s;es his life, and when the ball penetrates his che&s;t, or his vitals palpitate on the bayonet, beguiles his angui&s;h with the thought that he falls on the bed of honor, and dies in the defence of his country. For a trifling &s;tipend, the mariner encounters all the dangers of the deep, and braves a war of elements. Amid thick darkne&s;s, loud thunder, livid lightening, and deluging rains, he mans the rocking yards, climbs the reeling ma&s;t, or toils at the laborious pump. Faithful to his &s;hipmates, and obedient to the ma&s;ter, he declines no &s;ervice but courageou&s;ly keeps death at bay un|til he &s;inks beneath a mountain of waters. All this do the&s;e poor men ri&s;k and &s;uffer, &s;trange to tell, without one Chri&s;tian principle to &s;upport the &s;oul: While we, under all the &s;anctions of re|ligion, boa&s;ting patrician minds, enlarged with &s;ci|ence, and &s;uperior to vulgar flights, <HI>dare not</HI> imi|tate their hardihood. A mor&s;el of bread which is all they &s;eek, and all they gain, weighs heavier on the balance than the love of Chri&s;t, the glory of God, the &s;alvation of men, the authority of &s;crip|ture, the &s;en&s;e of right, the principle of honor, and
<PB N="100" REF="032281_0112_0FF1B2ED70E24840">all the prai&s;e and glory of an immortal crown!! Well might our Lord exhort us to <HI>labor</HI> for the bread that peri&s;heth not, and to <HI>agonize</HI> to enter in at the &s;traight gate!</P>
<P>Con&s;ider next the officers of the army and navy. They are born as well, educated as delicately, and have as large &s;hare of the good things of this world as the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. They are re&s;ined in their ideas, often effeminate in their manners, and in their per&s;ons, not more robu&s;t than our&s;elves. But when their country calls for their &s;words, they come forth with a commendable gallantry; and, without the hardy habits of the private, go through the &s;ame fatigues, and confront the &s;ame perils. Not content with meeting dangers they cannot &s;hun, the principle of honor, and the hope of preferment, pu&s;h them on to &s;eek occa&s;ions of di&s;tinction by atchievements of heroi&s;m. Never|thele&s;s, they have parents, wives, and children, as we have, who depend for a maintenance on the lives of which they are &s;o prodigal.</P>
<P>But how do the officers of the armies of Chri&s;t conduct them&s;elves? Little better, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, than an undi&s;ciplined militia, who have covenanted to fight only pro aris et focis; and who are encouraged to put on a red coat and parade in military pomp, becau&s;e they flatter them&s;elves they &s;hall never be brought to pu&s;h a bayonet. To &s;ee us exerci&s;e at home might give a high idea of our courage and prowe&s;s, if it were not too well under&s;tood that we had an invincible di&s;like to hard blows and long marches. Good God! what flowing eloquence, what &s;trength of rea&s;oning, what animated declamation, do we hear from our pulpits! What potent demon&s;trations of the truths of Chri&s;tianity, what confutations of infidelity, what accurate inve&s;tigation of moral duties, what vehement recommendation of Chri&s;tian graces,

And who would not think, that among the many who write and &s;peak &s;uch things, a tolerable number might be found to pro|pagate in foreign parts a religion of which we are &s;o proud at home? Alas! while we have &s;oft pulpits and well dre&s;&s;ed congregations, &s;nug livings and quiet cures, good food and decent clothes, and may relieve the dry &s;tudy of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, by wantoning in the circle of ancient and modern &s;cience, we manoeuvre to admiration. But to abjure all &s;cience except that of the go&s;pel, to compa&s;s &s;ea and land for the love of Chri&s;t, to pro&s;titute our eloquence by &s;tammering in a barba|rous tongue, to exchange our poli&s;hed friends for &s;avage a&s;&s;ociates, to break our con&s;titution with hard&s;hips in a &s;ickly clime, and to put off the fine Gentleman, that we may put on the rough garb of Chri&s;t's &s;oldiers, are things hardly mentioned, and never taught in our colleges and univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>What a pity it is, Reverend Brethren, that men like us &s;o gentle and pacific, &s;o aver&s;e to the alarms of war, &s;o unambitious of martyrdom, and &s;o enamoured of the &s;ciences, &s;hould have en|li&s;ted under the banners of a Prince who affected to be neither philo&s;opher, grammarian, nor rhe|torician: who &s;uffered &s;o much in his own per&s;on as to be willing to allow &s;mall intervals of repo&s;e to his followers; who, in&s;tead of putting pens in our hands, lays cro&s;&s;es on our backs; and who in|&s;tead of deceiving us with fair &s;peeches, and allu|ring hopes of &s;ecular emoluments, declares unce|remoniou&s;ly, that if any man will not deny him|&s;elf and follow him, although it be to certain death, he is unworthy of him!&mdash;Would to God this were a &s;ubject in which there was no place for the&s;e biting ironies. But I am &s;ick at heart. I blu&s;h for my&s;elf and the honor of my corps, and mu&s;t write what I feel.

By the&s;e undertakings the names of Cooke, Wallis, Banks, Ledyard, Haughton, Maupertius, and others, have been re&s;cued from oblivion, and will be handed down to po&s;terity, together with the names of the great Kings, who&s;e commands they executed, as long as the records of &s;cience &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING traced the general outline of what I have to offer on Mi&s;&s;ions, I leave it to be filled up by your private meditations, or by &s;ome abler arti&s;t, who may be excited to pre&s;ent you with a fini&s;hed piece on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. But I can|not per&s;uade my&s;elf to lay a&s;ide my pen, without again addre&s;&s;ing to you the word of exhortation, and when &s;o many are forward in calling you into the field of political, or polemic, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, certainly I may be bold in provoking you to love of the mo&s;t di&s;inter|e&s;ted kind, and to tho&s;e good works which are the mo&s;t acceptable to God, as they originate in the pure&s;t principles.</P>
<P>In the Reverend Mr. Carey's Publication on this &s;ubject, I was &s;truck with the following pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;hall reque&s;t permi&s;&s;ion to lay before you. <Q>A Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter is a per&s;on who in a peculi|ar &s;en&s;e is <HI>not his own;</HI> he is the &s;ervant of God, and therefore ought to be wholly devoted to him.
<PB N="107" REF="032281_0119_0FF1B2FF6508D9A8">entering on that &s;acred office, he &s;olemnly under|takes to be always engaged, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in the Lord's work, and not to chu&s;e his own plea&s;ure or employment, or pur&s;ue the mini&s;try as a thing which is to &s;erve his own ends, or in|tere&s;ts, or as a kind of <HI>bye work.</HI> He engages to go where God plea&s;es, and to do, or endure what He &s;ees fit to command, in the exerci&s;e of his function, He virtually bids farewell to friends, plea&s;ures, and comforts, and &s;tands in readine&s;s to endure the greate&s;t &s;ufferings in the work of his Lord and Ma&s;ter.&mdash;It is incon&s;i&s;tent with mini&s;ters to plea&s;e them&s;elves with the thoughts of a numerous auditory, cordial friends, a civilized country, legal protection, affluence, &s;plendor, or even a competency. The &s;lights and hatred of men, fal&s;e friends, gloomy pri&s;ons and tortures, the &s;ociety of barbarians of un|couth &s;peech, mi&s;erable accommodations in wretched wilderne&s;&s;es, hunger &amp; thir&s;t, naked|ne&s;s, wearine&s;s, and painfulne&s;s, hard work, and lit|tle worldly encouragement, &s;hould rather be the objects of their expectation. Thus the Apo&s;tles acted in the primitive times, and endured hard|ine&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and though we, who live in a civilized country, where Chri&s;tianity is protected by law, are not called to &s;uffer the&s;e things while we continue here, yet, I que&s;tion, whether all are ju&s;tified in &s;taying here, while &s;o many are pe|ri&s;hing without the means of grace in other lands. Sure I am that it is entirely contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, for its mini&s;ters to be actuated by intere&s;ted motives. On the contra|ry their commi&s;&s;ion is a &s;ufficient call for them to venture all, and, like the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, go every where preaching the go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, Reverend Brethren, are &s;entiments wor|thy
<PB N="108" REF="032281_0120_0FF1B305976DAE40">of our character as the <HI>Servants of God.</HI> Re|jected by mercenary e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts and fa&s;hionable de|claimers they find acceptance with you, and are cheri&s;hed in your brea&s;ts: but, alas! how negli|gent are we in giving the&s;e principles their proper culture! <HI>Principles</HI> did I call them?&mdash;To what a dilemma am I reduced? Shall I wound you, or wrong the truth? Better far, if it be &s;o, to offend men than God. No, Brethren, I dare not call them <HI>principles,</HI> otherwi&s;e than as they are princi|ples of a &s;peculative &s;ublime theory, which few of us care to practi&s;e. In the clo&s;et we &s;ometimes meditate upon them with delight; in the pulpit we enforce them with energy; but how &s;oon, how very &s;oon, do we go away, and forget what man|ner of men we are?</P>
<P>"Who is he," &s;aid the beloved di&s;ciple, <Q>that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Je&s;us is the Son of God?</Q> Alas! of the thou|&s;ands of our I&s;rael, whether mini&s;ters or their flocks, how few are they who&s;e religion will bear this te&s;t? Where are the holy, happy &s;pirits who have <HI>overcome</HI> the world, and by a truly glorious victory ca&s;t contempt on Macedon and Rome? Where are the men who&s;e conver&s;ation is &s;o in heaven, who &s;o behold the glory of God, as to be rai&s;ed above the intere&s;ts, the hopes, the fears, the pomps and vanities of our petty &s;y&s;tem? O how very few there are to whom we can point with our &s;in|ger and &s;ay, that man is truly apo&s;tolic! The great majority of &s;uch as, in the judgment of charity, may be deemed <HI>&s;incere</HI> Chri&s;tians, are, neverthe|le&s;s, in a feeble, infantile, un&s;ettled &s;tate, halting often, &s;ometimes &s;tumbling, grieving their friends and affording triumph to their enemies. Notwith|&s;tanding the revival of religion which has taken place in England, in the la&s;t fifty years, what little|ne&s;s of faith, what coldne&s;s of love is there among
<PB N="109" REF="032281_0121_0FF1B3089B7CC610">us? While we compare our&s;elves among our&s;elves we are all di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume prai&s;e; but when we place our&s;elves in the light of God's countenance, with what difficulty do we endure the divine &s;plen|dor? What doubts, what fears, too often repel our confidence, confound our &s;pirits, &s;top our mouths and prevent the delightful accents of Abba Father, which can alone gladden our hearts?</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the &s;tate of things among us, I wonder that infidels have not thought it worth their while to follow, more generally, in the track of Mandeville, and relinqui&s;hing the attacks upon the doctrine and evidences of Chri&s;tianity, directed their malice to a more vulnerable art, and &s;tabbed our Savior through the per&s;ons of his followers. Where truth and brotherly kindne&s;s find &s;o much to cen&s;ure and lament, what havoc might we not ex|pect from ignorance, fal&s;hood, and malignity? This indeed appears to have been the mode of at|tack adopted by Voltaire and other pe&s;tiferous &s;pi|rits on the Continent. They have prevailed. The religion of Je&s;us is pro&s;cribed, his &s;abbaths are changed, his cro&s;s trampled upon, and his mediation de&s;pi&s;ed. But could Voltaire and his nefarious colleagues work &s;uch wonders? God forbid! The Prie&s;ts, the Prie&s;ts betrayed their God and their religion. Their bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition, &s;ecular and &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es, have made their flocks infi|dels and athei&s;ts, and a holy, righteous God has deli|vered them over to be de&s;troyed and plundered, by the mi&s;erable men whom they have provoked to madne&s;s, and cau&s;ed to bla&s;pheme that venerable name by which they were called. May we &s;ee the rod, and learn in&s;truction from their fall! May we be jealous of our mini&s;try, and compel men to re|&s;pect it, by &s;o making the light of our holy con|ver&s;ation to &s;hine before them, that they may &s;ee our good works and glorify our Father who is in
<PB N="110" REF="032281_0122_0FF1B30A28880D88">heaven. The mini&s;try has long fallen under great contempt among us, and the laity too generally con&s;ider us as mere &s;ecular men, who declaim for pay and with vile grimace, one day out of &s;even, hold forth a language, which if true, condemns our&s;elves as much as tho&s;e who hear us. In&s;tead of blaming them, let us reform our&s;elves, In&s;tead of talking of the dignity of our character, let us learn to feel and to &s;upport it. Let us &s;hew them that we de&s;pi&s;e money, are &s;uperior to popularity, and have renounced all meddling with what is for|eign to our calling. Let us mark the example of St. Paul, "Giving," as he &s;ays, <Q>no offence in any thing that the mini&s;try be not blamed; but in all things approving our&s;elves as the mini&s;ters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in nece&s;|&s;ities, in di&s;tre&s;&s;e&s;s, in &s;tripes, in impri&s;onments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fa&s;&s;ings, by purene&s;s, by knowlege, by long &s;uffering, by kindne&s;s, by the Holy Gho&s;t, by love unfeign|ed, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteou&s;ne&s;s on the right hand and on the left, by honor and di&s;honor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dy|ing and behold we live; as cha&s;tened, and not killed; as &s;orrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things.</Q></P>
<P>Let us do this, and the mini&s;try will hold up its head. And &s;hould it be thought, that the circum|&s;tances of our living in a Chri&s;tian country and en|joying the protection of equal laws, di&s;pen&s;e with our exhibiting &s;ome of tho&s;e atte&s;tations of our mini&s;try which the Apo&s;tle enumerates, I beg leave to ob&s;erve that as a mere nominal Chri&s;tianity in our countrymen will never &s;hield us from contempt, hatred, reproach, and per&s;ecution, as far as the
<PB N="111" REF="032281_0123_0FF1B30CA1AA0EA8">laws of the land will permit, in the faithful di&s;|charge of our mini&s;try, &s;o the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and exer|ci&s;e of fervent and expan&s;ive charity, both to the evil and the good, would nece&s;&s;arily make us &s;ym|bolize with the Apo&s;tles in labors, watchings, fa&s;t|ings, affliction, nece&s;&s;ities, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of various kinds. An attempt to do much good is the &s;ure way to &s;uffer much evil. Provided we will let the world go on as it plea&s;es, and &s;ee our fellow creatures po&s;t|ing to perdition without any, or with only feeble at|tempts to &s;ave them, they will leave us alone, and perhaps &s;peak well of us; but let us throw our|&s;elves in their way, let us attempt to &s;tem the tor|rent, and we &s;hall find religion will receive little better treatment at this day, than it did eighteen hundred years ago. Our meeting with &s;o little per|&s;ecution for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, is one demon&s;tra|tion, that our religion does not over much gall the Devil and his children. For he and they will cer|tainly fight for their kingdom.

<P>Churchmen, Di&s;&s;enters, Methodi&s;ts, what will you reply to this reproach? Shall we make a book to confute him? It will be found, I fear on the trial, that it is ea&s;ier to make a hundred books, than to engage one man to prove the &s;incerity of his love to peri&s;hing &s;inners, by &s;acrificing him&s;elf and his family to their welfare. Here we are dif|fering from each other in various points, and con|tending hard to &s;hew that our own Sect, whatever it is, is lodged in the in the penetralia of the Tem|ple of Truth, and is the foremo&s;t in the race for leaven; but when the que&s;tion is put, Which of you will for&s;ake all, deny him&s;elf, take up his cro&s;s, and, if God plea&s;es, die, for his religion? It pre&s;ently appears that Churchmen, Di&s;&s;enters, and Methodi&s;ts, are more clo&s;ely united in princi|ple and practice than they are aware of. We all &s;traightway, with one con&s;ent, begin to make apo|logies and to &s;ay, I pray have me excu&s;ed, while &s;ome openly ca&s;t contempt on the undertaking, and throw out evangelical jokes upon the few who con|&s;ider mi&s;&s;ions in a &s;erious light. Shall Churchmen, Di&s;&s;enters, Methodi&s;ts, deny the&s;e facts, becau&s;e there are among each of them a few men who&s;e conduct may be urged as an exception again&s;t them? Surely this is di&s;ingenuous.</P>
<P>Many of us complain of an antichri&s;tian union between Church and State, and that religion is
<PB N="115" REF="032281_0127_0FF1B31C21583970">fettered, and made, like a child, to walk in lead|ing &s;trings. We &s;ay that religion flouri&s;hed mo&s;t when &s;he had to contend with the State, and had no other &s;upport than what &s;he derived from her own native &s;trength. Let this be granted. It was &s;o once, but it is a little problematical, whether it would be &s;o now. "Tempora mutautur et nos matamur "in illis." Are we <HI>apo&s;tolic Chri&s;tians?</HI> Can <HI>we</HI> contend with hunger, thir&s;t, cold, naked|ne&s;s, perils, and the &s;word? Can <HI>we</HI> walk with|out tho&s;e leading &s;trings? If we can, and if we feel them &s;o gulling, &s;o degrading, why do we not do &s;o? Are there not two thirds of the world, where we &s;hall not be in&s;ulted by legal protection, or be paid, like &s;ecular men, for our labor? Have we not full opportunity of &s;hewing the politicians and great men of Europe, that Chri&s;t, his mini&s;|ters, and people, are able to uphold their religion in the world, without their &s;upport, and that we can multiply now, as in the primitive times, like the polypus, when he is cut in pieces? And yet the preci&s;e rea&s;on why we do not engage in Mi&s;&s;ions is becau&s;e we cannot enjoy that <HI>&s;ecular</HI> protection, and tho&s;e <HI>&s;ecular</HI> comforts, which we have in Eng|land. To follow the Son of God where he has no place to lay his head, and no other recompence to of|fer us, than the cup he drank of and the bapti&s;m with which he was baptized, is more I fear than we are able to do: and until we can do &s;o, it will re|main very que&s;tionable, whether we can walk with|out our leadings &s;trings.</P>
<P>This appears to be the ca&s;e &s;o evidently, that tho&s;e who patronize Mi&s;&s;ions feel it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;e|cularize them, and to put them, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, on the &s;ame footing as a parochial Cure in Eu|rope. They are afraid of alarming us by &s;hewing the dark &s;ide of things, and hardly conceive that there exi&s;ts among us men, who&s;e &s;pirits dare a&s;pire
<PB N="116" REF="032281_0128_0FF1B31F21628A10">to an <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> warfare. Hence it is, that neither they nor we have faith to think of &s;ubduing king|doms; nor are they to be &s;ubdued by a few fair weather &s;oldiers, accompanied by delicate women and children, educated in fa&s;hionable accompli&s;h|ments, and accu&s;tomed to all the delicacies of life; who are ab&s;olutely incapable of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;un, or wind, or rain, or of exerci&s;ing tho&s;e charities which were once the ornament and prai&s;e of Chri&s;tian matrons. I fear, I fear greatly, that I write to the winds, and that neither Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, nor their wives, have platy enough for this engagement; and that the Mi&s;&s;iona|ries we are able to &s;end out with the equipage they require for their camp, will do no more towards &s;ubduing India to the faith of Chri&s;t, than a few effeminate A&s;iatics, with their Harams and dancing girls, would do in an attempt to bring Great Britain under the yoke of the Mogul.</P>
<P>If there were ab&s;olutely none to encourage the attempt, and nothing exi&s;ting at this day in the form of a mi&s;&s;ion, the conduct of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t would be more excu&s;able; but it &s;eems, as if the Providence of God had kept alive &s;ome &s;en&s;e of duty, and &s;ome examples of zeal, both among laity and clergy, to be a te&s;timony again&s;t us, and to hold us up to infamy to future generations. What is done, indicates, that we know our duty; and what is left undone evinces, that we have no inclination to do it. We mini&s;ters have no rea&s;on to complain of the laity. They are willing to give us all encouragement; nay, they <HI>invite</HI> and <HI>&s;o|licit</HI> us to engage; and freely offer to do all in their power to make us comfortable; and yet we refu&s;e to &s;tir. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that this reproach falls more immediately on my&s;elf and other <HI>go&s;pel</HI> mini&s;|ters, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Sierra Leone Chap|lain&s;hip went a begging pretty far before it fell into
<PB N="117" REF="032281_0129_0FF1B322352020D0">the hands of my Colleague and my&s;elf; and now that we have declined it, it lies neglected, as no man thinks it worth his while to pick it up. For &s;ome years great enquiries were made to procure an A&s;&s;i&s;tant mini&s;ter for the Reverend Mr. John&s;on, at Port Jack&s;on, and with infinite difficulty, that po&s;t is, at la&s;t, &s;illed: but all the enquiries made among <HI>go&s;pel</HI> mini&s;ters, for three years pa&s;t, and, which are &s;till making, after an a&s;&s;i&s;tant for the Reverend Mr. Brown, at Calcutta, have hitherto been with|out effect. Whether this does us honor, I leave the world to judge. I &s;hall however contra&s;t the&s;e facts with one from Mr. Spangenberg, a Moravian Bi|&s;hop, who informs us, that when, at Bethlehem in North America, letters were read in the Brethren's congregation, &s;tating, that &s;everal of their mi&s;&s;ion|aries had been carried off by &s;ickne&s;s in the I&s;land of St. Thomas, in the We&s;t Indies, <HI>that very day</HI> &s;even Brethren offered to go and replace them.&mdash; This is ju&s;t what things ought to be, and any Church which can produce &s;uch men may engage in Mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>That our Brethren of the various denominations of Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters have any cau&s;e to rejoice over us in this re&s;pect is more than I know. Except the Reverend Mr. Carey and a friend who accom|panies him, I am not informed of any of their mi|ni&s;ters who are engaged in Mi&s;&s;ions. Would to God they would undertake &s;omething in this way for Chri&s;t, which might provoke us to jealou&s;y!&mdash; The Reverend Dr. Coke has of late years done &s;omething in this way in our We&s;t India I&s;lands; and might have done much more, had the Metho|di&s;t Preachers, <HI>as a body,</HI> given him that unequi|vocal &s;upport, to which his zeal in &s;uch a cau&s;e &s;hould entitle him.&mdash;Hitherto tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ions may be con&s;idered as <HI>his</HI> mi&s;&s;ions, rather than tho&s;e of the Methodi&s;ts. I am, however, happy to be in|formed
<PB N="118" REF="032281_0130_0FF1B323C80EF148">that his Brethren, begin to enter more heart|ily into the &s;pirit of Mi&s;tions, and I flatter my&s;elf they will now embark in them, with all their &s;oul, and all their &s;trength. But, whether they do it or not, it is infinitely to be de&s;ired that it &s;hould be done by &s;ome of us; for however we may &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves entitled to reprove each other about mode; of faith and forms of wor&s;hip, upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, I know not who may throw the fir&s;t &s;tone. And if I take the liberty of &s;peaking &s;o freely, I ap|peal to God, it is not becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf en|titled to reprove others from any merit of my own; but becau&s;e I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s my &s;in, and am willing to come in for a full &s;hare of our common &s;hame.</P>
<P>Our conduct in re&s;pect of Mi&s;&s;ions, evinces be|yond every thing the low degraded &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and the ideas which too gene|rally prevail about it threaten to degrade it &s;till lower. An improper attachment to &s;ecular inte|re&s;ts and honors, exerts too much of its baleful influence over tho&s;e who&s;e principles teach them better things; but what con&s;equences may not be expected to flow from the lave of money, and the love of prai&s;e, when men of the fir&s;t character and influence in the church avow them, as <HI>allowable motives of mini&s;terial conduct.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, we have lived to hear them &s;o avowed, and to the &s;hame of human nature, but to the exemplifica|tion of the &s;cripture declaration, that by wi&s;dom man knew not God, to hear them avowed from the admirable pen of ARCHDEACON PAIEY. After ad|ducing other rea&s;ons to &s;hew that a di&s;tinction of orders in the mini&s;try, is mo&s;t conducive to the general ends of its in&s;titution, he concludes as fol|lows &mdash; <Q>And la&s;tly, that the &s;ame fund pro|duces more effect, both as an allurement to men of talents to enter into the Church, and as a &s;ti|mulus
<PB N="119" REF="032281_0131_0FF1B32777B39138">to the indu&s;try of tho&s;e who are already in it, when di&s;tributed into prizes of different value, than when divided into equal &s;hares.</Q>&mdash;Paley's Moral Philo&s;ophy, vol. 2, p. 323.</P>
<P>God of heaven and earth, what a &s;tab is this to the vitals of thy religion! I appeal to every god|ly man in England, Whether all the talents, all the learning, and all the virtues of a Paley, can &s;hield the man who avows the&s;e &s;entiments from his contempt? And yet this is the man who teach|es us <HI>morals</HI>&mdash;who in&s;tructs our young mini&s;ters&mdash; who&s;e book is honored and applanded in our Uni|ver&s;ities! But who that adopts the&s;e &s;entiments will engage in mi&s;&s;ions? Alas, the <HI>allurement, the &s;timulus, the prizes,</HI> Mr. Paley talks of, may in|duce men to cultivate their talents with as much care as he has done, and to write as well as he has written; and they may, perhaps, draw from our eccle&s;ia&s;tical lottery, as rich a prize as he has drawn; but as &s;oon may the carrion crow beget a dove, as they will induce him to conduct him&s;elf in a mini&s;try as becometh the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus it is that we are not a&s;hamed to drive in|&s;olent bargains with the Son of God, and tell him we will &s;toop to a&s;&s;ume the contemptible character of his amba&s;&s;adors, if he will hold out to us rich and honorable prizes to allure men of our talents into the Church, and to &s;timulate our indu&s;try when we are in it. Truth, virtue, religion, God and heavenly glory, are no allurements, no &s;timu|lus, to our a&s;piring minds, until they receive the currency of this world, by being attached to the fools cap of human honor, or to that pernicious metal, which can transform the Apo&s;tles of Satan into the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. Others of us appear a&s;hamed of the&s;e &s;imonical practices, and &s;ay, <Q>Lord I will follow thee wither&s;oever thou goe&s;t; only &s;hew me a little more indulgence than thou

I will take up my cro&s;s; I only deprecate the be|ing crucified upon it. I am willing to for&s;ake much; but compa&s;&s;ionate my weakne&s;s, and do not command me to &s;ell all. I will follow thee any where on land; but O &s;pare me the horrors of a voyage by &s;ea. I will preach for thee among&s;t the poore&s;t of my own nation; but do not &s;end me to a &s;trange country. I acknowlege I am a mi&s;erable &s;inner, unworthy to be a door keeper in thy hou&s;e, neverthele&s;s, my elocution is po|pular, I am much followed and applauded: Will it not be more for thy glory for me to &s;tay at home, while any man of inferior talents may go and preach to the Heathens? I have heard that they offer human &s;acrifices in Otaheite, eat men in New-Zealand, are ab&s;olutely bruti&s;h at Port Jack&s;on, and that the &s;corching &s;un and hea|vy rains in Africa are inevitably fatal. O let the life of thy &s;ervant be precious in thy &s;ight! Send me not to untameable barbarians, or to a clime where I cannot be certain of my life for a day. Be&s;ides the difficulties of the&s;e undertak|ings are in&s;uperable. It is probable I mu&s;t cul|tivate the ground for my maintenance, and I have been brought up delicately from a child. Thy Apo&s;tles who were poor fi&s;hermen, and ne|ver po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my exten&s;ive learning, elegant man|ners, and genteel notions, were well &s;uited to this rough work; yet even they preached to a civilized people, and being furni&s;hed with miraculous powers, their labors were the more productive; but what &s;hall I do who have not their advantages, and have my mind &s;o vitiated by fal&s;e learning, that I cannot &s;toop to the &s;impli|city of the go&s;pel? Certainly to engage in mi&s;|&s;ions is to plough on a rock, or to build on the
<PB N="121" REF="032281_0133_0FF1B33087B849B0">wave. O let me be any thing but a mi&s;&s;ionary, for my &s;oul &s;inks within me at the mention of it, nor can I derive any con&s;iderations from earth, heaven, or hell to make me willing to die for thy &s;ake. I am not &s;ingular in my opinion of mi&s;&s;ions, for we are all agreed clergy and laity, churchmen and di&s;&s;enters, Indian directors and parliament men, with few exceptions, that they are impracti|cable; and that if they were not, yet "mi&s;&s;i|onaries would be a di&s;grace to any nation;" that we have no right to interfere in the chang|ing the religion of a foreign country.' They would certainly de&s;troy the Slave Trade in Afri|ca; and &s;ome well informed, re&s;pectable Direc|tors of the India Company, are of opinion that they would "&s;ubvert the Briti&s;h Empire in In|do&s;tan," which, they think, of far greater con|&s;equence than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of thy de&s;pi&s;ed kingdom. A few wretched Pariars might in|deed be converted, or rather made hypocrites by Chri&s;tian charity; but there is nothing in Thee, or thy go&s;pel, to influence Chiefs of the noble Ca&s;ts (who&s;e &s;ouls are certainly more valuable than tho&s;e of the vile Pariars as is a thou&s;and to one) to for&s;ake the religion of their ance&s;tors. Good Lord, what is to be done where every thing thus makes again&s;t us? O de&s;i&s;t from thy purpo&s;e! Thou art the Savior of all men, and God is a merciful Father to them all; if it plea&s;e thee, thou can'&s;t &s;ave the Heathens without the go&s;pel; and, if not, <HI>thy will be done.</HI> Never|thele&s;s Lord, if thou wilt force us to cultivate this unpromi&s;ing field, do not think of &s;ending mi&s;&s;ionaries out immediately, but let lay &s;chool|ma&s;ters go to receive the fir&s;t &s;ire, and teach the the little children reading and writing; and then will we go, and enter into their labors: for the experience of ages has taught us, that where the
<PB N="122" REF="032281_0134_0FF1B33213C756D8">preaching of the go&s;pel makes one Chri&s;tian, education makes ten. Hence in&s;tead of preach|ing fir&s;t to the parents, and then e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;chools, for the education of the children, as the Apo&s;tles did (who knew that the &s;word of the &s;pirit was of heavenly temper&mdash;an in&s;trument into which the God of Glory had wrought all his attributes, we, having lo&s;t the art of u&s;ing it, and that vigorous arm which gives it the demon|&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power) we go to work another way, by educating children fir&s;t; and many are of opinion, that the be&s;t way of enlightening the Heathens is by putting the moon in the &s;un's &s;phere, and having children to in|&s;truct their parents, rather than parents to teach their children.&mdash;If Lord thou wilt &s;eriou&s;ly weigh all the&s;e things, we flatter our&s;elves thou wilt be of our way of thinking.</Q></P>
<P>Wild, ludicrous, and even bla&s;phemous, as this &s;oliloquy may be, I am per&s;uaded, it does not con|tain a &s;entiment, which is not the genuine effu&s;ion of the human heart. I have traced &s;ome of them in my own heart, and I have detected others, in the language which has been frequently held to me on mi&s;&s;ions. I have only thrown them together, given them a tongue and utterance, and expo&s;ed them without di&s;gui&s;e as they walk before God, who &s;earches the heart. If mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tians will not recognize what exi&s;ts in their hearts, and lives in their lives, I have at lea&s;t done my duty in &s;et|ting it before them.

<P>Ought not we to have compa&s;&s;ion on our breth|ren, even as God hath compa&s;&s;ion on us? Have we looked into the heart of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and is it thus we read it?

By the &s;ongs of angels, who proclaimed peace and love at our Redeemer's birth; by the &s;olemn injunction of Him who &s;aid, "Ye are my friends, if ye keep my commandments;" by the glorious Penteco&s;t, when every language prai&s;ed God; by the multitudes who have wa&s;hed their robes in the blood of the Lamb; by the acts of the Apo&s;tles and the &s;ufferings of the martyrs; by the expiring pangs of Je&s;us, and by tho&s;e &s;ins of of ours which brui&s;ed him, and put him to grief; by their remi&s;&s;ion, if we have indeed ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious; by the fearful end of that &s;ervant who buried his Lord's talent; by the cur|&s;es and execrations which re&s;t upon the Chri&s;tian name; by the rivers of Heathen blood which Chri&s;|tians have &s;hed, and which call for expiation at our hands; "if there be any con&s;olation in Chri&s;t, if any comfort of love, if any fellow&s;hip of the &s;pi|rit, if any bowels and mercies," I be&s;eech you ho|nored and beloved Brethren, have mercy on the Heathens, and &s;o fulfil the joy of your Lord.</P>
<P>And now, Brethren, I throw my&s;elf at your feet; and a&s;k pardon for every ra&s;h and wounding expre&s;&s;ion which may have fallen from my pen. Con&s;cious inferiority bows me down, and nothing but a &s;en&s;e of duty and the love of truth could have erected my mind to write with the freedom I
<PB N="124" REF="032281_0136_0FF1B339D54799F0">have done, and to admoni&s;h thus loudly the mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t, the lea&s;t of whom I con&s;ider as my &s;uperior. If I have offended, I be&s;eech you to forgive me, even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake forgive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you. If I have, in any re&s;pect, over&s;teped the &s;oberne&s;s of trath, or violated the meekne&s;s of wi&s;|dom, I tru&s;t I &s;hall find mercy of the Lord, as hav|ing done it ignorantly, from a &s;incere de&s;ire to pro|mote his glory, the intere&s;ts of his religion, the hap|pine&s;s of his people, the &s;alvation of the Heathens, and the honor and dignity of his mini&s;tering &s;er|vants. I once more &s;ubmit to your candid atten|tion, as well as to your judicious correction, the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents of the&s;e pages. I promi&s;e &s;eriou&s;ly to re|view my own obligations to act in the way I recom|mend to you; and I flatter my&s;elf, that &s;ome one will take up the &s;ubject where I have laid it down, and do it that ju&s;tice, which it cannot receive from my hands.</P>
<P>I have the honor to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, with cor|dial e&s;teem,</P>
