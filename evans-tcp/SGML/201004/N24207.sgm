<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN pre&s;enting the following work of <HI>COUSTOS'S</HI> Sufferings to the public, it may be remarked that few publications have received &s;o exten&s;ive a patron|age from the fraternity as the pre&s;ent, and none held in more e&s;timation, as is fully evinced by the re&s;pectable li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers annexed to the Engli&s;h copy, prefaced with a dedication to his Royal High|ne&s;s the duke of Cumberland, the then Grand Ma&s;|ter. This proving the character and merit of the narrative, has induced the publi&s;her to pre&s;ume it will be equally acceptable to the craft on this &s;ide the Atlantic, particularly as ma&s;onry flouri&s;hes in this country in a manner hitherto unequalled in the hi&s;tory of cur noble order. A work of this na|ture well authenticated mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a va|luable tract&mdash;which for the honour of humanity it is firmly hoped, the like &s;cenes will again be never repeated.</P>
<P>An original attempt to arrange in order the different dome&s;tic lodges, will appear obviou&s;ly dif|ficult to effect with accuracy; but &s;o far as the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="ii" REF="031999_0004_0FF09B5FF8BCA0B0">has admitted, no attention has been withheld.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The editor here begs leave to pre&s;ent his ac|knowledgments to John Abrams <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Grand &s;ecretary for New-York, for his very polite a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in the accompli&s;hment of this part of the work.</NOTE> Foreign lodges are enumerated from the late&s;t ma|&s;ons calender that could be procured.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I CAN ju&s;tly affirm, that it was not vanity that induced me to publi&s;h the following accurate and faithful relation of my &s;ufferings in the Inqui&s;ition of Li&s;bon. A &s;trong de&s;ire to ju&s;tify my&s;elf with regard to the fal&s;e accu&s;ations brought by that tri|bunal again&s;t me; as well as again&s;t the brother|hood of Free-Ma&s;ons, of which I have the honour to be a member, were the chief motives for my ta|king up the pen. To this I will add, that I was very willing the whole world &s;hould receive all the lights and informations I was capable of giving it, concerning the &s;hocking inju&s;tice, and the horrid cruelties exerci&s;ed in the pretended holy office. Per|&s;ons who live in countries where this tribunal is had in abomination, will, from the peru&s;al of the fol|lowing &s;heets, have fre&s;h cau&s;e to ble&s;s providence, for not fixing their abode among the Spaniards, the Portugueze, or the Italians.</P>
<P>Such of my readers as may happen to go and re|&s;ide in countries where this barbarous tribunal is e&s;tabli&s;hed, will here find very &s;alutary in&s;tructions for their conduct; and, con&s;equently, be le&s;s liable to fall into the hands of the unrelenting Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, &s;pite of all the precautions taken by
<PB N="ii" REF="031999_0006_0FF09B0D70D47148">them, may yet have the &s;ad misfortune to become their innocent victims, will here be taught to avoid the &s;nares laid, in order to aggravate the charge brought again&s;t them. The&s;e &s;nares ought the more to be guarded again&s;t, as they are but too often &s;pread by the Inqui&s;itors, merely to give a &s;pecious air of ju&s;tice and equity to their iniquitous pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, I &s;hall fir&s;t give an impartial relation of my own pro&s;ecution and &s;ufferings, on account of my being a Free-Ma&s;on. I &s;hall add, for the &s;atisfaction of the curious, a &s;uccinct hi&s;|tory of the pretended holy office; its origin; its e&s;tabli&s;hment in France, Italy, Spain and Por|tugal; the manner how it gra&s;ped, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, the &s;upreme authority now exerci&s;ed by it, not only again&s;t tho&s;e con&s;idered by it as he|retics, but even again&s;t Roman Catholics; how pri&s;oners are proceeded again&s;t; the tortures inflicted on them, in order to extort a confe&s;&s;ion: the execution of per&s;ons &s;entenced to die; with an accurate de&s;cription of the <HI>Auto da F&eacute;,</HI> or gaol delivery, as we may term it; together with the &s;ufferings of many per&s;ons who fell victims to this tribunal. I likewi&s;e will add a plan of the hou&s;e of the Inqui&s;ition at Li&s;bon, in which I was con|fined &s;ixteen months, and whence I was removed to the galley, as it is called, in that city. I will
<PB N="iii" REF="031999_0007_0FF09AEB2BA07500">de&s;cribe this Portugueze galley; and the manner how pri&s;oners are lodged and treated in both tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a compari&s;on between the methods employed by the primitive church, in order to &s;uppre&s;s here&s;y, and convert heretics; and tho&s;e now made u&s;e of by the Inqui&s;itors (under the cloak of religion) indi&s;criminately towards all mankind, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as they pretend. I &s;hall relate what I my&s;elf was eye-witne&s;s of; and will annex the remarks of many ill-fated Roman Catholics, who, as well as my&s;elf, were the innocent victims to this dreadful tribunal.</P>
<P>I &s;hall think it a happine&s;s,&mdash;if the relation which I now offer &s;hould be found of u&s;e to the public; and &s;hall con&s;ider it as a &s;till greater, in ca&s;e it may help to open the eyes of tho&s;e, who, hur|ried on by an indi&s;creet, or rather blind zeal, think it a meritorious work, in the &s;ight of hea|ven, to per&s;ecute all per&s;ons who&s;e religious prin|ciples differ from theirs.</P>
<P>In order to give the reader all the proof po&s;&s;i|ble, in the nature of the thing, that I have really undergone the tortures mentioned in the following account of my &s;ufferings, I &s;hewed the marks &s;till remaining on my arms and legs, to Dr. Hoad|ly, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Cary, &s;urgeons:
<PB N="iv" REF="031999_0008_0FF09B63D2020BE0">and I think my&s;elf particularly obliged to the&s;e gentlemen, for the leave they have given me to a&s;&s;ure the public, they were quite &s;atisfied that the marks mu&s;t have been the effect of very great vio|lence; and that, in their &s;ituation, they corre&s;|pond exactly to the de&s;cription of the torture.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE SUFFERINGS OF JOHN COUSTOS, IN THE INQUISITION AT LISBON.</HEAD>
<P>I AM a native of Berne in Switzerland, and a lapidary by profe&s;&s;ion. In 1716, my father came, with his whole family, to London; and as he propo&s;ed to &s;et|tle in England, he got him&s;elf naturalized there.</P>
<P>After living twenty-two years in that city, I went, at the &s;olicitation of a friend, to Paris, in order to work in the galleries of the Louvre. Five years after I left this capital, and removed to Li&s;bon, in hopes of finding an opportunity of going to Bra|&s;il, where I flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould
<PB N="2" REF="031999_0010_0FF09B0F91C95070">make my fortune. But the king of Por|tugal, whom I addre&s;&s;ed in order to ob|tain permi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e, being in|formed of my profe&s;&s;ion, and the &s;kill I might have in diamonds, &amp;c. his maje&s;ty, by the advice of his council, refu&s;ed my petition, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that it would be no way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proper to &s;end a foreigner, who was a lapidary, into a country aboun|ding with immen&s;e trea&s;ures, who&s;e value the government endeavours, by all means po&s;&s;ible, to conceal, even from the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was waiting for an an&s;wer from court, to my petition, I got acquainted with &s;everal &s;ub&s;tantial jewellers, and other per&s;ons of credit, in Li&s;bon; who made me the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t generous offers, in ca&s;e I would re&s;ide among them, which I accepted, after having lo&s;t all hopes of going to Bra&s;il. I now was &s;et|tled in the above mentioned city, equally to the &s;atisfaction of my friends, my em|ployers, and my&s;elf; having a pro&s;pect of gaining wherewithal, not only to &s;upport my family with decency, but al&s;o to lay up a competency for old age, could I but have e&s;caped the cruel hands of the In|qui&s;itors.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="031999_0011_0FF09B3377E1F438">
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, by the way, that the In|qui&s;itor have u&s;urped &s;o formidable a pow|er in Spain and Portugal, that the monarchs of tho&s;e kingdoms are no more, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, than as their chief &s;ubjects. Tho&s;e tyrants do not &s;cruple to encroach &s;o far on the privilege of kings, as to &s;top, by their own authority at the po&s;t-office, the letters of all whom they take it into their heads to &s;u&s;pect. In this manner I my&s;elf was &s;erved, a year before the In|qui&s;itors had ordered me to be &s;eized; the de&s;ign of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was to &s;ee, whether among the letters of my corre&s;pon|dents, &s;ome mention would not be made of Free-Ma&s;onry; I pa&s;&s;ing for one of the mo&s;t zealous members of that art, which they re&s;olved to per&s;ecute, upon pretence that enormous crimes were committed by its profe&s;&s;ors. However, though the Inqui&s;i|tors did not find, by one of my intercepted letters, that Free-Ma&s;onry either &s;truck at the Romi&s;h religion, or tended to di&s;turb the government; &s;till they were not &s;atis|fied, but re&s;olved to &s;et every engine at work, in order to di&s;cover the my&s;teries and &s;ecrets of Ma&s;onry. For this purpo&s;e, they concluded that it would be proper to
<PB N="4" REF="031999_0012_0FF09AC5AF31D920">&s;eize one of the chief Free-Ma&s;ons in Li&s;|bon; and accordingly I was pitched upon, as being the ma&s;ter of a lodge; they like|wi&s;e-ca&s;t their eye on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> warden, an inti|mate friend of mine, Mr. Alexander James Mouton, a diamond cutter, born in Paris, and a Romani&s;t. He had been &s;ettled &s;ix years, before his &s;eizure, at Li&s;bon, in which city he was a hou&s;e-keeper; and where his integrity, &s;kill, and behaviour were &s;uch, as gained him the approbation of all to whom he was known.</P>
<P>The reader is to be informed, that our lodges, in Li&s;bon, were not kept at taverns, &amp;c. but alternately at the private hou&s;es of cho&s;en friends. In the&s;e we u&s;ed to dine together, and practi&s;e the &s;ecrets of Free-Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>As we did not know that our art was forbid in Portugal, we were &s;oon di&s;cover|ed by the barbarous zeal of a lady, who declared, at confe&s;&s;ion, that we were Free-Ma&s;ons; that is, in her opinion, mon&s;ters in nature, who perpetrated the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing crimes. This di&s;covery immediately put the vigilant officers of the Inqui&s;ition upon the &s;cent after us: on which occa&s;ion my friend Mr. Mouton fell the fir&s;t victim, he being &s;eized in manner following.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="031999_0013_0FF09AFE0596FFF0">
A jeweller and gold&s;mith, who was a fa|miliar of the holy office, &s;ent a friend, (a Free-Ma&s;on al&s;o) to Mr. Mouton; upon pretence that he wanted to &s;peak with him, about mending a diamond weighing four carrats. They agreed upon the price; but as this was merely an artifice, in order for our familiar to know the per&s;on of the &s;aid Mouton, he put him off for two days; upon pretence that he mu&s;t fir&s;t enquire of the owner of the diamond, whether he approved of the price &s;ettled between them.</P>
<P>I happened to be at that time with Mr. Mouton; a circum&s;tance which gave the highe&s;t joy to the jeweller; finding that he had got a &s;ight, at one and the &s;ame time, of the very two Free-Ma&s;ons whom the In|qui&s;itors were determined to &s;eize.</P>
<P>At our taking leave, he de&s;ired us to come together, at the time appointed, to which we both agreed. The jeweller then made his report to the Inqui&s;itors, who ordered him to &s;eize us, when we &s;hould return about the diamond in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Two days being elap&s;ed, and my bu&s;ine&s;s not permitting me to accompany Mr. Mou|ton, he went alone to the jeweller, to fetch the diamond, which was computed to be worth an hundred moidores. The fir&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="031999_0014_0FF09AC7943BA830">que&s;tion the jeweller a&s;ked, after the u&s;ual compliments, was, "Where is your friend Cou&s;tos?"&mdash;As this jeweller had before &s;hown me &s;ome precious &s;tones, which he pretended I &s;hould go to work upon, Mr. Mouton, imagining he was de&s;irous of put|ting them in&s;tantly into my hands, replied: <Q>That I was upon 'Change; and that, if he thought proper, he would go and fetch me.</Q> However, as this familiar, and five &s;ubaltern officers of the Inqui&s;ition, who were along with him, were afraid of lo&s;ing half their prey; they inveigled Mr. Mou|ton into the back &s;hop, upon pretence of a&s;king his opinion concerning certain rough diamonds. After &s;everal &s;igns and words had pa&s;&s;ed between them, the olde&s;t of the company ri&s;ing up, &s;aid, he had &s;omething particular to communicate to Mr. Mouton; upon which he took him behind the curtain; when, enquiring his name and &s;irname, he told him that he was his pri&s;oner, in the king's name.</P>
<P>Being &s;en&s;ible that he had not committed any crime for which he could incur his Por|tugueze maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure, he gave up his &s;word the moment it was demanded of him. Immediately &s;everal tru&s;ty officers of the Inqui&s;ition, called familiars, fell upon
<PB N="7" REF="031999_0015_0FF09B19E64FEC20">him to prevent his e&s;caping; they then com|manded him not to make the lea&s;t noi&s;e, and began to &s;earch him. This being done, and finding he had no weapons, they a&s;ked whether he was de&s;irous of knowing in who&s;e name he had been &s;eized? Mr. Mouton an&s;wered in the affirmative: <Q>We &s;eize you (&s;aid they) in the name of the Inqui&s;ition; and, in its name, we forbid you to &s;peak, or murmur ever &s;o little.</Q> Saying the&s;e words, a door at the bottom of the jeweller's &s;hop, and which looked into a narrow bye|lane, being opened; the pri&s;oner, accompa|nied by a commi&s;&s;ary of the holy office, was thrown into a &s;mall chai&s;e, where he was &s;o clo&s;ely &s;hut up, (it being noon day,) that no one could &s;ee him. This precaution was u&s;ed to prevent his friends from getting the lea&s;t information concerning his impri&s;on|ment; and con&s;equently from u&s;ing their en|deavours to procure his liberty.</P>
<P>Being come to the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;i|tion, they threw him into a dungeon, and there left him alone; without indulging him the &s;atisfaction they had promi&s;ed, which was, to let him &s;peak, immediately upon his arrival, to the pre&s;ident of the holy office; to know from him, the rea&s;on of his detainer. On the contrary, they were &s;o cruel to Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="031999_0016_0FF09AC9AF157780">Mouton's reputation, as to &s;pread a report he was gone off with the diamond above-mentioned. But how greatly were every one of his friends &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked at this &s;lander! As we all entertained the high|e&s;t idea of his probity, none of us would give credit to this vile report; whence we unanimou&s;ly agreed, after duly weighing this matter, to go in a body to the jeweller, who was the owner of the diamond, and offer him the full payment of it; firmly per&s;uaded, that nothing but the mo&s;t fatal and unex|pected accident could have made him di&s;|appear thus &s;uddenly, without giving &s;ome of his friends notice of it. However, the jeweller refu&s;ed our offer in the polite&s;t manner; a&s;&s;uring us at the &s;ame time, that the owner of the diamond was &s;o wealthy a man, that the lo&s;s of it would be but a tri&s;le to him.</P>
<P>But as truth frequently breaks through all the veils with which fal&s;ehood endeavours to cloud her; this genero&s;ity in per&s;ons to whom we were, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;trangers, made us &s;u&s;pect &s;ome iniquitous, dark act. Our conjecture appeared but too well grounded, from the &s;evere per&s;ecution that was imme|diately rai&s;ed again&s;t the Free-Ma&s;ons; I my&s;elf being &s;eized four days after.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="031999_0017_0FF09B4C0846D9C8">
I perhaps &s;hould have e&s;caped their mer|cile&s;s paws, had I not been betrayed, in the mo&s;t barbarous manner, by a Portugueze friend of mine, as I fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed him to be; and whom the holy office had ordered to watch me narrowly. This man &s;eeing me in a coffee-hou&s;e, the 5th of March, 1742-3, between nine and ten at night; went and gave notice thereof to nine officers of the Inqui&s;ition, who were lying in wait for me, with a chai&s;e, near that place.</P>
<P>I was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, when, at my going out of the coffee-hou&s;e with two friends, the above officers &s;eized me only. Their pretence for this was, that I had pa&s;|&s;ed my word for the diamond which Mr. Mouton had run away with: that I mu&s;t certainly be his accomplice, &s;ince I had en|gaged my friends to offer to pay for the diamond; all which (added they) I mu&s;t have done in no other view than to conceal my villany. It was to no purpo&s;e that I alledged a thou&s;and things in my own ju&s;|tification. Immediately the wretches took away my &s;word; hand-cuffed me; forced me into a chai&s;e drawn by two mules; and in this condition I was hurried away to the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>But, &s;pite of the&s;e &s;everities, and their
<PB N="10" REF="031999_0018_0FF09AB386D48130">commanding me not to open my lips, I yet called aloud to one of my friends (Mr. Richard) who had been at the coffee-hou&s;e with me, and was a Free-Ma&s;on; conjuring him to give notice to all the re&s;t of our bre|thren and friends, of my being &s;eized by command of the holy office, in order that they might avoid the misfortune which had befallen me, by going voluntarily to the Inqui&s;itors, and accu&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take notice, that the Inqui&s;itors very &s;eldom cau&s;e a per&s;on to be &s;eized in broad day light, except they are almo&s;t &s;ure that he will make no noi&s;e nor re&s;i&s;tance. This is a circum&s;tance they ob&s;erve very &s;trictly, as is evident from the manner in which they took Mr. Mouton. Farther, they frequently make u&s;e of the king's name and authority on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to &s;eize and di&s;arm the pretended criminal, who is afraid to di&s;obey the orders he hears pro|nounced. But as darkne&s;s befriends deeds of villany, the Inqui&s;itors, for this rea&s;on, u&s;ually cau&s;e their victims to be &s;ecured in the night.</P>
<P>The Portugueze, and many foreigners, are &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ini&s;ter accidents which often happen at Li&s;bon in the night-time, e&s;pecially to a per&s;on who ventures
<PB N="11" REF="031999_0019_0FF09ADE0FCBDE78">out alone, that few are found in the &s;treets of this city at a late hour.</P>
<P>I imagined my&s;elf &s;o &s;ecure in the com|pany of my friends, that I &s;hould not have been afraid of re&s;i&s;ting the officers in que&s;|tion, had the former lent me their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But unhappily for me, they were &s;truck with &s;uch a &s;udden panic, that every one of them fled; leaving me to the mercy of nine wretches, who fell upon me in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>They then forced me to the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition, where I was delivered up to one of the officers of this pretended holy place. This officer pre&s;ently calling four &s;ubalterns, or guards, the&s;e took me to an apartment, till &s;uch time as notice &s;hould be given to the pre&s;ident of my being catched in their &s;nare.</P>
<P>A little after, the above-mentioned officer coming again, bid the guards &s;earch me; and take away all the gold, &s;ilver, papers, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ors, buckles, &amp;c. I might have about me. They then led me to a lonely dun|geon, expre&s;sly forbidding me to &s;peak loud, or knock at the walls; but that, in ca&s;e I wanted any thing, to beat again&s;t the door, with a padlock, that hung on the outward door; and which I could reach, by thru&s;t|ing my arm through the iron grates. It
<PB N="12" REF="031999_0020_0FF09AABD32E4B28">was then that, &s;truck with all the horrors of a place of which I had heard and read &s;uch baleful de&s;criptions, I plunged at once into the blacke&s;t melancholy; e&s;pecially when I reflected on the dire con&s;equences with which my confinement might very po&s;&s;ibly be attended.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed a whole day and two nights in the&s;e terrors, which are the more difficult to de&s;cribe, as they were heightened at every little interval, by the complaints, the di&s;mal cries, and hollow groans (echoing through this dreadful man&s;ion) of &s;everal other pri|&s;oners, my neighbours; and which the &s;o|lemn &s;ilence of the night made infinitely more &s;hocking. It was now that time &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all motion, and the&s;e three&s;core hours appeared to me like &s;o many years.</P>

<P>The&s;e apprehen&s;ions, together with the reflections which rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted to me, viz. that it would be highly incumbent on me to calm the tumult of my &s;pirits, in or|der, to prevent my falling into the &s;nares which my judges would not fail to &s;pread round me; either by giving them an op|portunity of pronouncing me guilty, or by forcing me to apo&s;tatize from the re|ligion in which I was born; the&s;e things,

<P><Q>That it appeared from other traditions, that the kings of Scotland had frequently been grand ma&s;ters of the Free-Ma&s;ons; and that, when the kings were not &s;uch, the &s;ociety were impowered to elect, as grand ma&s;ter, one of the nobles of the country, who had a pen&s;ion from the &s;o|vereign; and received, at his election, a gift from every Free-Ma&s;on in Scotland.</Q></P>
<P>I likewi&s;e told them; <Q>That queen Eli|zabeth, a&s;cending the throne of England, at a time that the kingdom was greatly divided by factions and cla&s;hing intere&s;ts; and taking umbrage at the various a&s;&s;em|blies of great numbers of her &s;ubjects, as not knowing the de&s;igns of tho&s;e meet|ings; &s;he re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s the a&s;&s;em|blies
<PB N="20" REF="031999_0028_0FF09ABA755E4EC8">of the Free-Ma&s;ons; however, that, before her Maje&s;ty proceeded to this ex|tremity, &s;he commanded &s;ome of her &s;ub|jects to enter into this &s;ociety, among whom was the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, primate of her kingdom: that the&s;e, obey|ing the queen's orders, gave her &s;o very advantageous a character, of the fidelity of the Free-Ma&s;ons, as removed, at once, all her maje&s;ty's &s;u&s;picions and political fears: &s;o that the &s;ociety have, ever &s;ince that time, enjoyed in Great-Britain, and the places &s;ubject to it, all the liberty they could wi&s;h for, and which they have never once abu&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>They afterwards enquired, <Q>What was the tendency of this &s;ociety?&mdash;I replied: Every Free-Ma&s;on is obliged, at his ad|mi&s;&s;ion, to take an oath, on the holy go&s;|pel, that he will be faithful to the king; and never enter into any plot or con|&s;piracy again&s;t his &s;acred per&s;on, or again&s;t the country where he re&s;ides: and that he will pay obedience to the magi&s;trates appointed by the monarch.</Q></P>
<P>I next declared, <Q>That charity was the foundation, and the &s;oul, as it were, of the &s;ociety; as it linked together the &s;e|veral individuals of it, by the tye of fra|ternal
<PB N="21" REF="031999_0029_0FF09B0497A9ADA0">love; and made it an indi&s;pen&s;able duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t, in the mo&s;t charitable man|ner, without di&s;tinction of religion, all &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous per&s;ons as were found true objects of compa&s;&s;ion.</Q>&mdash;It was then they called me liar; declaring, <Q>that it was impo&s;&s;ible this &s;ociety &s;hould profe&s;s the practice of &s;uch good maxims, and yet be &s;o very jealous of its &s;ecrets as to exclude women from it.</Q> The judicious reader will perceive, at once, the weakne&s;s of this inference, which perhaps would be found but too true, were it applied to the inviola|ble &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved by this pretended holy office, in all its actions.</P>
<P>They pre&s;ently gave orders for my be|ing conveyed into another deep dungeon; the de&s;ign of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was to ter|rify me completely; and here I continued &s;even weeks. It will be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that I now was overwhelmed with grief. I will confe&s;s, that I then gave my&s;elf up entirely for lo&s;t; and had no re&s;ource left but in the Almighty, who&s;e aid I implored continually with the utmo&s;t fervency.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay in this mi&s;erable dun|geon, I was taken three times before the Inqui&s;itors. The fir&s;t thing they made me do was, to &s;wear on the bible, that I would
<PB N="22" REF="031999_0030_0FF09AE4C1DA26D0">not reveal the &s;ecrets of the Inqui&s;ition; but declare the truth with regard to all &s;uch que&s;tions as they &s;hould put to me: they added, <Q>That it was their firm opinion that Ma&s;onry could not be founded on &s;uch good principles as I, in my former inter|rogatories, had affirmed; and that, if this &s;ociety of Free-Ma&s;ons was &s;o virtuous as I pretended, there was no occa&s;ion of their concealing, &s;o very indu&s;triou&s;ly, the &s;ecrets of it.</Q></P>
<P>I told them, <Q>That as &s;ecrecy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the principal parts that makes a man be deemed wife, is his intelligent &s;trength and ability to cover and conceal &s;uch hone&s;t &s;ecrets as are committed to him, as well as his own &s;erious affairs. And whoever will peru&s;e &s;acred and pro|fane hi&s;tory, &s;hall find a great number of virtuous attempts (in peace and war) that never reached their de&s;igned ends, through defect of &s;ecret conceal|ment; and yet, be&s;ides &s;uch unhappy prevention, infinite evils have thereby en&s;ued. But before all other examples, let us con&s;ider that which excels all the re&s;t derived even from God him&s;elf. Who &s;o e&s;pecially pre&s;erves his own &s;ecrets to him&s;elf, never letting any man know what &s;hould happen on the morrow; nor could the wi&s;e men in ages pa&s;t, divine what &s;hould befall us in this age: whereby we may readily di&s;cern that God him&s;elf is well plea&s;ed with &s;ecrecy. And although (for man's good) the Lord has been plea&s;ed to reveal &s;ome things, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible at any time to change or alter his determination, in regard whereof the re|verend wi&s;e men of ancient times, evermore affected to perform their intentions &s;ecretly.
<P>The Athenians had a &s;tatue of bra&s;s, which they bowed to; the figure was made without a tongue, to declare &s;ecrecy thereby.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants of Plancus are much commended, becau&s;e no torment could make them confe&s;s the &s;ecret which their ma&s;ter entru&s;ted them with.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the &s;ervant of Cato the orator was cru|elly tormented, but nothing could make him reveal the &s;ecrets of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tothe was demanded what thing appeared mo&s;t difficult to him; he an&s;wered, to be &s;ecret and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e St. Ambro&s;e, in his offices, pla|ced among the principal foundations of virtue, the patient gift of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e king Solomon &s;ays in his proverbs, that a king ought not to drink wine, becau&s;e drunken|ne&s;s is an enemy to &s;ecrecy; and, in his opinion, he is not worthy to reign that cannot keep his own &s;ecrets; he furthermore &s;ays, that he which di&s;co|vers &s;ecrets is a traitor, and he which conceals them is a faithful brother: he likewi&s;e &s;ays, that he that refraineth his tongue, keeps his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Therefore I am of opinion, that if &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence be duly con&s;idered, they will be found mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a man for any bu&s;ine&s;s of impor|tance: if this be granted, I am confident that no man will dare to di&s;pute that Free-Ma&s;ons are &s;upe|rior to all other men, in concealing their &s;ecrets, from time immemorial; which the power of gold, that of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en has betrayed kings and princes, and &s;ometimes overturned whole empires, nor the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments could never extort the &s;ecret (even) from the weake&s;t member of the whole fraternity.</P></NOTE> naturally

<P>A phy&s;ician was then &s;ent, who finding me exceedingly ill, made a report thereof to the Inqui&s;itors. The&s;e, upon their be|ing informed of it, immediately gave orders for my being removed from this frightful dungeon, into another, which admitted

I added, <Q>that the convent of the Franci&s;cans having been burnt down, the fathers made a gathering; and I gave them, upon the exchange, three quarters of a moidore.</Q> I declared farther, <Q>that a poor Roman Catholic, who had a large family, and could get no work; being in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, had been recommen|ded to me, by &s;ome Free-Ma&s;ons; with a reque&s;t that we would make a pur&s;e, among our&s;elves, in order to &s;et him up again, and thereby enable him to &s;upport his family: that accordingly we rai&s;ed

I naturally concluded, from the beha|viour of the Inqui&s;itors, at my being brought before them four days after, that they had enquired into the truth of the &s;everal particulars related before. They now did not &s;ay a word concerning Ma|&s;onry, but began to work with different engines.</P>
<P>They then employed all the powers of their rhetoric to prove, <Q>that it became me to con&s;ider my impri&s;onment, by order of the holy office, as an effect of the goodne&s;s of God; who (added they) in|tended to bring me to a &s;erious way of thinking; and, by this means, lead me into the paths of truth, in order that I might labour efficaciou&s;ly at the &s;alvation of my &s;oul.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the repeated declara|tions made by me, that I would never change my religion, the Inqui&s;itors were as urgent as ever. Encouraged by the apo&s;tacy of one of my Brother-Ma&s;ons, they flattered them&s;elves with the hopes of prevailing on me to imitate him; and, for this purpo&s;e, offered to &s;end &s;ome Engli&s;h friars to me, who (they &s;aid) would in&s;truct me; and &s;o fully open my eyes, that I &s;hould have a di&s;tinct view of my wretched condition, which (they declared) was the more deplorable, as I was now wholly in|&s;en&s;ible of its danger.</P>
<P>Finding me &s;till immoveable, and that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of their making the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on me; the indulgence which they &s;eemed to &s;how at the beginning of my examination, was &s;uddenly changed

<P>One thing I can a&s;&s;ure my reader is, that the Inqui&s;itors were not able to alter, in any manner, the firm re&s;olution I had taken, to live and die a prote&s;tant: on the contrary, I can affirm, that their remon|&s;trances,

<P>I acknowledge, that I owe this wholly to the divine goodne&s;s, which graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to &s;upport me under the&s;e violent trials, and enabled me to per&s;evere to the end; for this I return unfeigned thanks to the Almighty; and hope to give, during the remainder of my life, convin|cing te&s;timonies of the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion which tho&s;e trials made on my mind, by devoting my&s;elf &s;incerely to the duties of religion.</P>
<P>I was ordered back, by the Inqui&s;itors, to my di&s;mal abode; after they had decla|red to me, <Q>that if I turned Roman Ca|tholic, it would be of great advantage to my cau&s;e; otherwi&s;e that I perhaps might repent of my ob&s;tinacy when it was too late.</Q> I replied, in a re&s;pectful manner, that I could not accept of their offers.</P>
<P>A few days after, I was again brought before the pre&s;ident of the holy office, who &s;aid, <Q>that the proctor would read, in pre&s;ence of the court, the heads of the indictment or charge brought again&s;t me.</Q> The Inqui&s;itors now offered me a coun|&s;ellor,

<P>Being &s;en&s;ible that the per&s;on whom they would &s;end me for this purpo&s;e, was him|&s;elf an Inqui&s;itor, I cho&s;e rather to make my own defence, in the be&s;t manner I could. <Q>I therefore de&s;ired that leave might be granted me to deliver my de|fence in writing;</Q> but this they refu&s;ed, &s;aying, <Q>that the holy office did not allow  pri&s;oners the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper.</Q> I then begged they would permit me to dictate my ju&s;tification, in their pre&s;ence, to any per&s;on whom they &s;hould appoint; which favour was granted to me.</P>
<P>The heads of the charge or indictment brought again&s;t me, were; '<HI>That I had infringed the pope's orders, by my belonging to the &s;ect of the Free-Ma&s;ons; this &s;ect be|ing a horrid compound of &s;acrilege, &s;odomy, and many other abominable crimes: of which the inviolable &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved therein, and the exclu&s;ion of women, were but too manife&s;t indications: a circum&s;tance that gave the highe&s;t offence to the whole kingdom: and the &s;aid Cou&s;tos having refu&s;ed to di&s;cover, to the Inqui&s;itors, the true tendency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d de|&s;ign of the meetings of Free-Ma&s;ons: and per&s;i&s;ting, on the contrary, in a&s;&s;erting, that

<P>The Inqui&s;itors then gave me the above heads, ordering me to &s;ign them, which I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. They thereupon com|manded me to be taken back to my dun|geon, without permitting me to &s;ay a &s;ingle word in my ju&s;tification.</P>

<P>Six weeks after, I appeared in pre&s;ence of two Inqui&s;itors, and the per&s;on whom they had appointed to take down my de|fence; which was little more than a reca|pitulation of what I before had a&s;&s;erted with regard to Ma&s;onry.</P>

<P>The reader will believe that my pains mu&s;t be intolerable, when I &s;olemnly de|clare, that the&s;e ropes, which were of the &s;ize of one's little finger, pierced through my fle&s;h quite to the bone; making the blood gu&s;h out at the eight different places that were thus bound. As I per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to di&s;cover any more than what has been &s;een in the interrogatories above; the ropes were thus drawn together four different times. At my &s;ide &s;tood a phy|&s;ician and a &s;urgeon, who often felt my temples, to judge of the danger I might be in; by which means my tortures were &s;u&s;pended, at intervals, that I might have an opportunity of recovering my&s;elf a lit|tle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was thus &s;uffering they were &s;o barbarou&s;ly unju&s;t as to declare, that, were I to die under the torture, I &s;hould be guilty, by my ob&s;tinacy, of &s;elf-murder.

<P>The&s;e barbarians finding that the tortures above de&s;cribed could not extort any far|ther di&s;covery from me; but that, the more they made me &s;uffer, the more fervently I addre&s;&s;ed my &s;upplications, for patience, to heaven; they were &s;o inhuman, &s;ix weeks after, as to expo&s;e me to another kind of torture, more grievous, if po&s;&s;ible, than the former. They made me &s;tretch my arms in &s;uch a manner, that the palms of my hands were turned outward; when, by the help of a rope that fa&s;tened them toge|ther at the wri&s;t, and which they turned by an engine; they drew them gently nearer to one another behind, in &s;uch a manner that the back of each hand touched, and &s;tood exactly parallel one to the other; whereby both my &s;houlders were di&s;located, and a con&s;iderable quantity of blood i&s;&s;ued from my mouth. This torture was re|peated thrice; after which I was again taken to my dungeon, and put into the hands of phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons, who, in &s;etting my bones, put me to exqui&s;ite pain.</P>

<P>As I had &s;uffered greatly in my body, by the tortures inflicted on me in the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition, of which the reader has &s;een a very imperfect, though faithful nar|rative, in the foregoing &s;heets; I was quite unfit to go about the painful labour that was immediately allotted me, viz. the carrying water (an hundred pounds weight) to the pri&s;ons of the city. But the fears I was under, of being expo&s;ed to the in|humanity of the guards or over&s;eers who accompany the galley &s;laves, cau&s;ed me to exert my&s;elf &s;o far beyond my &s;trength, that, twelve days after, I fell grievou&s;ly &s;ick. I then was &s;ent to the Infirmary, where I continued two months. During my abode in this place, I was often vi&s;ited by the Iri&s;h friars belonging to the convent of Corpo Santo, who offered to get my
<PB N="52" REF="031999_0063_0FF09B00A4A1D2A8">relea&s;e, provided I would turn Roman Catholic. I a&s;&s;ured them, that all their endeavours would be fruitle&s;s; I expecting my enlargement from the Almighty alone, who, if He, in his profound wi&s;dom thought proper, would point out other expedients for my obtaining it, than my becoming an apo&s;tate.</P>
<P>Being unable, after this, to go through the toils to which I had been &s;entenced, I was excu&s;ed, by my amply rewarding the over&s;eers. It was now that I had full lei&s;ure, to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the means of obtaining my liberty; and, for this purpo&s;e, de&s;ired a friend to write to my brother-in-law, Mr. Barbu, to inform him of my deplorable &s;tate; and to intreat him, humbly to addre&s;s the Earl of Har|rington, in my favour; my brother-in-law having the honour to live in his lord&s;hip's family. This nobleman, who&s;e humanity and genero&s;ity have been the theme of infinitely abler pens than mine, was &s;o good as to declare, that he would endea|vour to procure my freedom. According|ly, his lord&s;hip &s;poke to his grace the duke of Newca&s;tle, one of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; in order to &s;upplicate 'for leave, from our Sovereign, that his
<PB N="53" REF="031999_0064_0FF09B3F9BB16E88">mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon might demand me, as a &s;ubject of Great Britain.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, ever attentive to the fe|licity of his &s;ubjects, and de&s;irous of relieving them in all their misfortunes, was &s;o gracious as to interpo&s;e in my favour. Accordingly his commands being di&s;patch|ed to Mr. Compton, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon, that gentleman demanded my liberty of the king of Portugal, in his Britannic maje&s;ty's name; which accord|ingly I obtained the latter end of Octo|ber, 1744. The per&s;on who came and freed me from the galley, by order of the Inqui&s;itors, took me before them. The pre&s;ident then told me, that Cardinal da Cunha had given orders for my being relea&s;ed. At the &s;ame time, he bid me return to the holy office in three or four days.</P>
<P>I could perceive, during this interval, that I was followed by the &s;pies of the Inqui&s;ition, who kept a watchful eye over my behaviour, and the places I frequented I waited upon our envoy, as likewi&s;e upon our con&s;ul, whom I informed of the com|mands which had been laid upon me at the Inqui&s;ition; and tho&s;e gentlemen ad|vi&s;ed me to obey them. They cautioned
<PB N="54" REF="031999_0065_0FF097D368B11958">me, however, to take a friend with me, in order to give them notice in ca&s;e I &s;hould be &s;eized again. I accordingly returned to the Inqui&s;itors five days after, when the pre&s;ident declared; <Q>that the tribunal would not permit me to continue any longer in Portugal; and therefore that I mu&s;t name the city and kingdom whi|ther I intended to retire.'&mdash;' As my family, (replied I) is now in Lon|don, I de&s;ign to go thither as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</Q> They then bid me embark in the fir&s;t &s;hip that &s;hould &s;ail for En|gland; adding, that the in&s;tant I had found one, I mu&s;t inform them of the day and hour I intended to go on board, together with the captain's name, and that of his &s;hip.</P>
<P>A report prevailed &s;ome days after, that one of the per&s;ons &s;eized by the In|qui&s;ition for Free-Ma&s;onry, and who ob|tained his liberty by turning Roman Catho|lic, had been &s;o indi&s;creet as to divulge the cruelties exerci&s;ed in this tribunal.</P>
<P>I now imagined that prudence required me to &s;ecure my&s;elf from a &s;econd per&s;e|cution. As there was, at this time, no Engli&s;h &s;hip in the port of Li&s;bon, I wait|ed upon Mr. Vantil, the re&s;ident of Her
<PB N="55" REF="031999_0066_0FF09AF8CB083FD0">and be&s;ought him to &s;peak to the Dutch admiral to admit me on board his fleet. The re&s;ident, touched with my ca|lamities, hinted my reque&s;t to the admiral, who generou&s;ly complied with it. I then went, together with a friend, and informed the Inqui&s;itor, that I de&s;igned to embark for England, in the Damietta, commanded by vice admiral Cornelius Sereiver, who was to &s;ail in a few days. Upon the In|qui&s;itor's enquiring the exact time when I intended to go on board; I replied, at nine o'clock the next morning. He then bid me come to him preci&s;ely at that hour; adding, that he would &s;end &s;ome officers of the Inqui&s;ition to &s;ee me on &s;hip|board.</P>
<P>The&s;e orders giving me great unea&s;ine&s;s, I waited upon the &s;everal gentlemen above mentioned; when telling them the injunc|tions laid upon me, they advi&s;ed me to act very cautiou&s;ly on this occa&s;ion. I there|fore thought it would be &s;afe&s;t for me to go on board immediately, without giving any notice of it to the Inqui&s;itors. We lay at anchor, after this, near three weeks before Li&s;bon.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="031999_0067_0FF09ACC379B65B8">
The Inqui&s;itor no &s;ooner found that I failed coming to him at the time appointed, in order to be conducted to the &s;hip, than he &s;ent out about thirty &s;pies.

But their endeavours to find me being fruitle&s;s, &s;ome officers of the Inqui&s;ition getting into a boat, rowed &s;everal times round the three Dutch men of war lying at anchor: The&s;e officers imagined, that if I was on board, and con&s;equently in a place of &s;ecurity, I &s;hould not be afraid of &s;howing my&s;elf; a circum&s;tance that would have put an end to their &s;earch, which co&s;t them &s;ome pains and expence.

<P>Their &s;earch was &s;o open, both at the hou&s;e where I lodged, as well as at other places, that I was &s;oon informed of it; at which I &s;hould have been delighted, had not my joy been damped by the apprehen|&s;ions I was under, left my dear friend, Mr. Mouton, the companion of my &s;ufferings and tortures, merely on account of Free-Ma&s;onry,

He coming accordingly next day, was received, with great &s;atisfaction, by the whole &s;hip's company, e&s;pecially by my&s;elf, I having a peculiar e&s;teem for him, which I &s;hall ever entertain.</P>
<P>We &s;et &s;ail two days after.

This was par|ticularly con&s;picuous in the admiral, he ordering the utmo&s;t care to be taken of us, all the time we were on board his &s;hip; he &s;ometimes conde&s;cending to admit us to his table, when he would talk to us with the utmo&s;t familiarity. This di&s;tinction won us the civility of every per&s;on in the &s;hip, which continued till our arrival at Port&s;mouth, where we landed; without ha|ving been put to a farthing expence during the whole voyage.</P>
<P>All the&s;e favours, &s;o generou&s;ly be&s;towed by the admiral, call aloud for the &s;tronge&s;t acknowledgments of gratitude.</P>

To conclude, I arrived in London the 15th of December 1744, after a long and dangerous voyage.</P>

<HEAD>ORIGIN OF THE INQUISITION, AND <HI>Its</HI> ESTABLISHMENT <HI>in various Countries.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Roman pontiffs employed every expedient, and &s;et every engine at work (among which none has &s;erved their pur|po&s;e better than religion) in order to in|crea&s;e their authority. Pretending to be the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of St. Peter, they a&s;cribed to them&s;elves characteri&s;tics of holine&s;s &s;uperior even to that of the apo&s;tles; and were &s;o extravagant as even to boa&s;t their being infallible. Monarchs, infatuated with this pretended &s;anctity of the popes, whom they con&s;idered as deities upon earth, and di&s;pen&s;ers of cele&s;tial ble&s;&s;ings; &s;trove to rival one another in be&s;towing territories, &amp;c. upon the&s;e pontiffs, in
<PB N="60" REF="031999_0071_0FF09B128ED1EE18">hopes of obtaining their favour; adding &s;uch exten&s;ive privileges, that the&s;e pon|tiffs became, at la&s;t, the arbiters of crown|ed heads, who did not di&s;cover, till it was too late, that they them&s;elves were become &s;laves to the papal authority.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e princes being oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of their chains, and de&s;i|rous of throwing them off, re&s;i&s;ted the will of the holy father, and thereupon were declared heretics, and excommunica|ted. Nor did the&s;e popes &s;top here; for, if the&s;e kings per&s;i&s;ted in their ob&s;tinacy, they were dethroned, and their domini|ons given to others, who readily offered to pay the obedience claimed by the &s;ee of Rome.</P>
<P>The emperors, jealous to &s;ee the Roman pontiffs, and their adherents, extend their authority &s;o far beyond its ju&s;t limits; did all that lay in their power to re&s;train and reduce it within narrower bounds. About the middle of the XIth. century, there broke out violent conte&s;ts between them, which raged above fifty years.</P>
<P>The emperors and popes being thus exa&s;perated again&s;t each other, no longer acted in concert, in order to &s;uppre&s;s here&s;y; &s;o that the&s;e commotions gave
<PB N="61" REF="031999_0072_0FF09AB0101E6378">occa&s;ion to the &s;tarting up of &s;everal new here&s;iarchs. Hitherto the latter had op|po&s;ed only the my&s;teries; but now, lea|ving the my&s;teries, they attacked morality and di&s;cipline, and e&s;pecially the papal authority. This was more than &s;ufficient to open the eyes of the court of Rome, with regard to the danger which threat|ened it, in ca&s;e a &s;peedy remedy &s;hould not be found, in order to check the&s;e heretics, before the contagion was be|come general; under favour of the di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the emperor and the pope.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e heretics, or rather enemies of the pontifical authority of Rome, were exceedingly numerous; not to mention their being &s;upported, clande&s;tinely, by kings; the popes were forced, at fir&s;t, to wink at, and even tolerate tho&s;e heretics, till &s;uch time as an opportunity might offer, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, or rather rooting them out. For this rea&s;on, the Roman pontiffs now contented them&s;elves with writing often to the princes, magi&s;trates and bi&s;hops; exhorting them to exert their utmo&s;t endeavours, in order to extirpate the enemies of the &s;ee of Rome. How|ever, princes and magi&s;trates took little
<PB N="62" REF="031999_0073_0FF09A9E7A2CEDD8">pains to check them; whether it were that they did not care to &s;acrifice a &s;et of people who were of &s;o much u&s;e to them, in order for re&s;training the papal authority, and increa&s;ing their own; or, whether they did not think them &s;o criminal as the popes pretended; or whether politics, which often vary according to times and intere&s;ts, cau&s;ed them to con&s;ider the&s;e heretics as per&s;ons whom it was incumbent on them to tolerate, for their own advan|tage.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops, either through indolence, or becau&s;e they were not &s;trong enough to oppo&s;e the &s;tream, were equally un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful, whereby heretics became &s;o powerful, that, at length, they were able to make head again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome.</P>

This here&s;iarch, after exciting many troubles in Bre&s;cia and Rome, was hanged in the latter city, anno 1155, and his a&s;hes thrown into the Tiber. The followers of Anthony Arnauld (the Jan&s;eni&s;ts) were al&s;o named Arnaldi&s;ts.</NOTE> who were among the&s;e, reduced the popes to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es;

<P>The Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, (people of France) ri&s;ing up after them, were no le&s;s enemies to the authority u&s;urped by the Roman pontiff, nor le&s;s zealous in attack|ing it: and the protection indulged tho&s;e people by Raymond Count de Toulou&s;e, and by Counts de Foix and de Comminges, cau&s;ed them to be &s;till more enterpri&s;ing and more formidable.</P>
<P>Pope Innocent III. a man of great &s;pi|rit, and fortunate in his enterprizes, form|ed a de&s;ign of promulgating a cru&s;ade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cru&s;ades were military expeditions, e&s;tab|li&s;hed again&s;t the infidels, and fir&s;t preached by Peter the hermit.

<P>The origin of the Inqui&s;ition is thus re|lated, by Fleury, in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;|tory. <Q>In 1198, Innocent III. &s;ent into the &s;outhern provinces of France, two Ci&s;tercian monks, Reinier and Gui, to convert the Manichees, with which tho&s;e parts &s;warmed; to excommunicate the ob&s;tinate; and to command the lords to con&s;i&s;cate the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the excom|municated; to bani&s;h them, and puni&s;h them with &s;everity: impowering, at the &s;ame time, Reinier to force the lords likewi&s;e; to excommunicate them, and put their lands under &s;eque&s;tration.&mdash;

<HEAD>Dawn of the <HI>INQUISITION</HI> in <HI>FRANCE,</HI> with the farther conte&s;ts between the Em|peror and Popes.</HEAD>
<P>THIS open war again&s;t the Albigen&s;es and Walden&s;es, was followed by the e&s;|tabli&s;hment of the Inqui&s;ition, which com|pleted the de&s;truction of the unhappy people in que&s;tion. It had been founded, a little before, by pope Innocent III. under the direction of Dominic, upon whom the title of &s;aint was be&s;towed.</P>
<P>This pope, reflecting that, what open force &s;oever might be exerted again&s;t them, &s;till va&s;t numbers would carry on their wor&s;hip in private, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;tanding and perpetual re|medy; that is, a tribunal compo&s;ed of men, who&s;e &s;ole occupation &s;hould be the &s;earching after, and puni&s;hing heretics.
<PB N="68" REF="031999_0079_0FF09B16459F3D50">This tribunal was named, 'The Inqui|&s;ition,' and Dominic was the fir&s;t Inqui|&s;itor.</P>
<P>Dominic having been &s;ent, as was ob|&s;erved, to Toulou&s;e, to convert the here|tics, took up his re&s;idence at the hou&s;e of a nobleman of this city, infected with here&s;y. However, our mi&s;&s;ionary found means to bring him back to the church; after which the nobleman devoted his hou&s;e, with his family, to St. Dominic and his order. The tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;hed in this place, which is &s;till called, 'The hou&s;e of the Inqui&s;i|tion.'</P>
<P>It may hence be concluded, that Domi|nic was the fir&s;t Inqui&s;itor, and Toulou&s;e the fir&s;t city where the Inqui&s;ition was &s;et|tled. Some &s;ay that this was in 1208, and others in 1212, or 1215; but which&s;oever may be the true aera, is of no great con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The&s;e Inqui&s;itors had, at fir&s;t no par|ticular tribunal, their function being only to enquire or &s;earch after heretics (whence the former received their name;) to ex|amine into their number, &s;trength and riches; which being done, they made a report thereof to the bi&s;hops, who, as yet,
<PB N="69" REF="031999_0080_0FF09AE89CE3A910">were the only per&s;ons authorized to take cognizance of &s;piritual matters. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the Inqui&s;itors u&s;ed to urge the prelates to excommunicate and pu|ni&s;h all heretics who &s;hould be impea|ched.</P>
<P>Pope Innocent being wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with the indolence of the bi&s;hops, and their officials (judges) who&s;e zeal he thought much too lukewarm again&s;t heretics; ima|gined that he perceived, in the Dominican and Franci&s;can friars, who&s;e orders were but lately founded, all the qualities requi&s;ite for directing this new e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. The monks of tho&s;e orders were fired with an implicit and boundle&s;s zeal for the court of Rome, and wholly devo|ted to its intere&s;ts. They had full lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue that glorious work, as this would be their only bu&s;ine&s;s. They were de|&s;cended from the dregs of the people; and had no kindred, as it were, or any other tie which might check the rigours of this tribunal; they were &s;evere and inflexible; the &s;olitude and au&s;tere life profe&s;&s;ed by them, and of which they &s;eemed already tired; the meanne&s;s of their dre&s;s and mona&s;teries, &s;o widely different from their pre&s;ent &s;tate; and e&s;pecially the humility
<PB N="70" REF="031999_0081_0FF09B24730D7928">and mendicant life to which they, perhaps, had too heedle&s;sly devoted them&s;elves; the&s;e things, I &s;ay, rendered them exceed|ingly fit for the office in que&s;tion, which, (in the opinion of the pontiffs) would &s;of|ten the a&s;perity of their vows, and &s;ooth their ambition, &s;ome &s;eeds whereof were &s;till left in their minds. The Roman pope having thus made &s;ure of a &s;et of people, &s;o firmly devoted to his &s;ervice, and &s;o admirably well qualified to exerci&s;e an employment, who&s;e chief characteri&s;tics are extreme &s;everity and cruelty; &s;ought for every opportunity to encrea&s;e their authority, by appointing them a particular tribunal, where they were to &s;it, hear, and pronounce &s;entence again&s;t here&s;ies and he|retics, as judges delegated by him, and re|pre&s;enting his per&s;on.</P>
<P>This pope fir&s;t enlarged their authority, by empowering them to be&s;tow indul|gences, to publi&s;h cru&s;ades, and to excite nations and princes to join the cru&s;aders, and march forth in order to extirpate here&s;y.</P>
<P>In 1244, the emperor Frederic II. increa&s;ed their power much more, by publi&s;hing four edicts in Pavia. He therein declared him&s;elf protector of the
<PB N="71" REF="031999_0082_0FF09AF70F376E78">Inqui&s;itors; decreed, that the clergy &s;hould take cognizance of here&s;y, and the lay judges pro&s;ecute heretics, after that the former had heard them. He likewi&s;e enacted, that all ob&s;tinate here|tics &s;hould be burnt; and &s;uch as repented, impri&s;oned for life. The rea&s;on why Fre|deric te&s;tified &s;o much zeal for the Chri&s;|tian religion was, in order to de&s;troy the report which the popes, with whom he had been engaged in violent conte&s;ts, &s;pread, throughout all the courts of Chri&s;|tendom, viz. that he intended to renounce the Chri&s;tian religion, and turn Mahome|dan. This, very probably, induced him to exert him&s;elf with greater &s;everity again&s;t the heretics, than any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors; he being the fir&s;t emperor who &s;entenced to death all heretics without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Here follows what other authors &s;ay, concerning the ri&s;e of the Inqui&s;ition in France. Du Cange tells us, that the Inqui&s;itors were e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country about the year 1229, again&s;t the Walden|&s;es, by the council of Toulou&s;e; which Inqui&s;itors were cho&s;en from among the Dominicans; and &s;ome were appointed under Francis I. again&s;t the Lutherans;
<PB N="72" REF="031999_0083_0FF09B1852814630">and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a bull of pope Clement VII. in 1225. Though the tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition was never &s;ettled in France, after the &s;ame manner as in Spain and Italy, yet Inqui&s;itors were delegated to France, during many years, by the pope; to pre&s;erve the purity of doctrine, and keep the people obedient to the church. Twelve years after the death of St. Do|minic, pope Gregory IX. named two friars of the &s;ame order, anno 1233, to exerci&s;e the like functions; and this apo&s;|tolical commi&s;&s;ion was perpetuated, not only in the convent of Toulou&s;e, but extended to &s;everal other convents in the kingdom. One of the commi&s;&s;ioners, nominated in the cau&s;e of the Templars, was the Inqui&s;itor general in France. We find by <HI>l'hi&s;toire de la Pucelle d'Orleans</HI> [the maid of Orleans] that, anno 1430, John Magi&s;tri, vicegerent [&s;ub&s;titute] of John Goverant, Inqui&s;itor of the faith, was one of her judges; that 35 years after, John Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hal (who was an Inqui&s;itor) and &s;ome prelates, deputed by pope Ca|lixtus, declared her innocent. It does not appear that there were, from this time till the reign of Francis I. any In|qui&s;itors (of this &s;ort) in France; whether
<PB N="73" REF="031999_0084_0FF09ACEB82FB678">it were that the popes did not think them nece&s;&s;ary, in an age when errors were in a great mea&s;ure rooted up; or that the then reigning princes, being more jealous of the regal authority than their predece&s;&s;ors, would not &s;uffer any in|fringement (as this &s;eemed to be) of the liberties of the Gallican church. See father Bouhours' life of St. Ignatius, Book II. This author ob&s;erves farther, that, under Francis I. Matthew Ori, was rai|&s;ed, by pope Clement VII. to the em|ployment of Inqui&s;itor, on occa&s;ion of the here&s;ies of Germany.&mdash;There are now no foot&s;teps of the Inqui&s;ition left in France, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cept in Toulou&s;e, where there is an Inqui&s;itor, a Dominican; but then his authority relates only to the examining of books concerning doctrine.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;ition would have been in|troduced into this kingdom under Francis II. had not the excellent Mighel de l'Ho&s;pital, chancellor of France, &s;trongly oppo&s;ed that de&s;ign. <Q>When the pa&s;&s;ing the edict of the Inqui&s;ition of Spain came before Chancellor de l'Ho&s;pital; as he knew that the members of the privy council and the parliaments had con&s;ented to it, he drew up another

<HEAD>INQUISITION <HI>of</HI> ROME.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inqui&s;ition of Rome is compo|&s;ed of twelve cardinals, and &s;ome other officers. The pope pre&s;ides per&s;onally in this a&s;&s;embly. The Inqui&s;ition is the chief tribunal of Rome. The congre|gation of the Inqui&s;ition was fir&s;t e&s;tab|li&s;hed in 1545. The above cardinals a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the title of Inqui&s;itors general throughout the Chri&s;tian world;
<PB N="75" REF="031999_0086_0FF09AA6AD43BCF0">but they have no juri&s;diction in France, and &s;ome other Romi&s;h countries. They are empowered to deprive or remove all inferior Inqui&s;itors, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of Italy.</P>
<P>Popes, Innocent, Alexander, Urban, Clement, and the &s;even pontiffs their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, exerted their utmo&s;t endea|vours, but to no purpo&s;e, to prevail with the Venetians to follow the example of the other &s;tates of Italy in this parti|cular.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Inqui&s;itors, were circum&s;tances which &s;trongly induced the republic of Venice to refu&s;e admi&s;&s;ion to that tribunal in its territories. The only topic of di&s;cour&s;e, in all places, was the di&s;orders and &s;editions cau&s;ed by the &s;er|mons, as well as the imprudent beha|viour of the Inqui&s;itors: for the&s;e zeal|ots would, upon any caprice, publi&s;h cru&s;ades again&s;t the heretics; when the cru&s;aders in que&s;tion, who had been drawn together on a &s;udden, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the cau&s;e of religion, only revenged them|&s;elves of their enemies; and &s;eized the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a numberle&s;s multitude of innocent per&s;ons, upon the fal&s;e pretence
<PB N="76" REF="031999_0087_0FF09B799E18D580">of their being heretics. Milan and Parma were very near ruined by the &s;editions rai&s;ed in them on the&s;e occa&s;ions; and nothing was heard, all over Italy, but bitter complaints again&s;t the Inqui&s;ition and the Inqui&s;itors. The &s;enate of Ve|nice, who under&s;tood their intere&s;t as well as any body of men in the world, took advantage of the di&s;orders above-mention|ed, to ju&s;tify their con&s;tant refu&s;al of this tribunal.</P>
<P>However, pope Nicholas IV. being no ways di&s;heartened at all the fruitle&s;s at|tempts made by his predece&s;&s;ors, renewed them; when the &s;enate perceiving that they, in ca&s;e they per&s;i&s;ted in their refu&s;al, would, at la&s;t, be forced to admit an In|qui&s;ition dependant on that of Rome: they e&s;tabli&s;hed one by their own authority, compo&s;ed of both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and lay judges. This Inqui&s;ition has its own laws, which differ from tho&s;e of the tribunals of this kind &s;ettled in Italy, and is far le&s;s rigorous. The utmo&s;t precautions were taken by tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;hed this Inqui|&s;ition, to prevent &s;uch di&s;orders as had broke out in all other places where it had been admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031999_0088_0FF09AC0C8E3C990">
The &s;enate having thus taken the re&s;olu|tion to admit the Inqui&s;ition, an act or in&s;trument for that purpo&s;e, was drawn up the 4th of Aug. 1289, in the mo&s;t authen|tic manner, and &s;ent to the pope. Though the pontiff was not plea&s;ed with the modi|fications introduced by the &s;enate, he ne|verthele&s;s expre&s;&s;ed, in outward &s;how, his approbation of the in&s;trument pre&s;ented to him; and ratified it by a bull dated the 28th of Augu&s;t above-mentioned; in hopes that the Venetians might afterwards be prevailed upon to comply with the de|&s;ires of the court of Rome, which, how|ever, they have not yet done. On the contrary, this &s;age republic, &s;o far from repealing the old laws, e&s;tabli&s;hes new ones, whenever it is apprehen&s;ive that the court of Rome intends to le&s;&s;en its au|thority, by enlarging that of the Inqui&s;i|tion. How glorious it is for this republic, to &s;ee, in its territories, the tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition, &s;ubject to the ordinances and laws which the &s;enate formerly pre|&s;cribed, and &s;till pre&s;cribe to it; at a time that this tribunal governs and commands; in the mo&s;t de&s;potic manner, in all the other &s;tates where it was received without re&s;triction; and is now become the mo&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="031999_0089_0FF09AA5045494E0">formidable, the mo&s;t dreadful, and mo&s;t cruel tribunal in the univer&s;e; in&s;omuch that even kings them&s;elves are not &s;ecure from its pro&s;ecutions, at lea&s;t from its re&s;entment!</P>
<P>With regard to the kingdom of Naples, the Inqui&s;ition has never been received there. This was owing, at fir&s;t, to the almo&s;t perpetual di&s;&s;entions which reigned between the Neapolitan kings and the Roman pontiffs. From the time that the Spani&s;h monarchs have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that kingdom, how great a harmony &s;oever might &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them and the court of Rome, yet things have always conti|nued on the &s;ame foot, and this from a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, viz. that the popes them&s;elves oppo&s;ed it; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e the kings of Spain in&s;i&s;ted per|petually, that the Neapolitan Inqui&s;itors ought to be dependant on the Inqui&s;itor General of Spain, and not on the general Inqui&s;ition of Rome, as the popes a&s;&s;erted. This the latter would never con&s;ent to; and from this argument, that as the king|dom of Naples held, of the &s;ee of Rome. and not of Spain; the Inqui&s;ition &s;hould con&s;equently hold likewi&s;e of the pope. But as the&s;e two courts were never able
<PB N="79" REF="031999_0090_0FF09B7C044DFD60">to agree about this matter, the Neapolitan bi&s;hops have always enjoyed the privilege of judging heretics. However the pope may, in certain ca&s;es, depute commi&s;&s;aries to Naples, to judge of heretical matters; but this happens &s;eldom or never. In 1544, Don Pedro, of. Toledo, viceroy of Naples under the emperor Charles V. endeavoured to &s;ettle the Inqui&s;ition in that kingdom; but the people mutinying his de&s;ign was defeated.</P>

<P>THOUGH the Inqui&s;ition had been &s;trongly oppo&s;ed in France and Germany, it yet gained footing in Spain; the kings of Arragon admitting it into the &s;everal &s;tates dependant on their crown. Endea|vours were u&s;ed, but to no purpo&s;e, to force it into the we&s;tern parts of Europe; the people oppo&s;ing it with the utmo&s;t vigour, whereby it lo&s;t a con&s;iderable part of its power in the kingdom of Ar|ragon; till Ferdinand, king of that coun|try,
<PB N="80" REF="031999_0091_0FF09A9BEB01A8A8">and I&s;abella of Ca&s;tile, uniting under one monarchy, by their marriage, almo&s;t all the Spani&s;h dominions; re&s;tored the tribunal in que&s;tion to its pri&s;tine authority in Arragon, and afterwards in all Spain, which was not properly brought under the yoke of the Inqui&s;ition, till about the year 1484.</P>
<P>The court of Rome was indebted for this to John de Torquemada, a Domini|can. This friar, who was confe&s;&s;or to I&s;abella, had made her promi&s;e, before &s;he came to the throne, that, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be rai&s;ed to it, &s;he would u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible methods to extirpate heretics and infidels. As &s;he afterwards was queen, and brought the kingdom of Ca&s;tile, by way of dower, to Ferdinand; they finding them&s;elves exceedingly powerful, re&s;olved to conquer the kingdom of Granada, and to drive back the Moors into Barbary. The Moors were accordingly &s;ubdued; and all the territories po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them in Spain &s;eized, &s;o that prodigious multi|tudes of them were forced to return into Africa. Neverthele&s;s, great numbers &s;till continued in Spain; a circum&s;tance owing to their having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or wives in this
<PB N="81" REF="031999_0092_0FF09B7EB9CF1A50">country, or their being &s;ettled in traffic there.</P>
<P>As Ferdinand and I&s;abella con&s;idered that, in ca&s;e they &s;hould bani&s;h the&s;e Moors from Spain, they thereby would depopulate the countries conquered by them; their maje&s;ties con&s;ented that they, as well as the Jews, &s;hould continue in it, provided they would turn Chri&s;tians; upon which tho&s;e people, finding that all re&s;i&s;tance would be vain, embraced the Chri&s;tian religion, in outward appear|ance.</P>
<P>But now Torquemada a&s;&s;uring the queen, that this di&s;&s;imulation would be of infinite prejudice both to the church and &s;tate, was urgent with her to perform the promi&s;e &s;he had made him, viz. of pro&s;ecuting the infidels and heretics as &s;oon as &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be &s;eated on the throne. He enforced his entreaties with all the arguments which fal&s;e politics and fal&s;e religion could &s;ugge&s;t; concluding, that the be&s;t expedient would be, to introduce and &s;ettle the Inqui&s;ition under the au|thority of their maje&s;ties. In a word, the queen, after many &s;olicitations, pro|mi&s;ed to u&s;e her utmo&s;t endeavours to get the kings con&s;ent; which &s;he after|wards
<PB N="82" REF="031999_0093_0FF09AA94E791400">obtaining, their maje&s;ties demanded and procured, from pope Sixtus IV. anno 1478, bulls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bulls are properly letters, with a leaden &s;eal, i&s;&s;ued out of the chancery of Rome; and an&s;wer to the letters patent, edicts, &amp;c. publi&s;hed by order of temporal princes.

<P>Torquemada had been of &s;uch impor|tant &s;ervice to the &s;ee of Rome, that it was natural he &s;hould be rewarded by it; the pope rai&s;ing him to the purple. He afterwards was appointed by Ferdinand and I&s;abella, Inqui&s;itor General of the whole monarchy of Spain; and he di&s;|charged the functions of his employment, &s;o much to their expectation, that he pro|&s;ecuted, in 14 years, above 100,000 per|&s;ons, 6000 of whom were &s;entenced to the flames.</P>
<P>Matters were afterwards carried to &s;uch a height, by the barbarous zeal of princes, that Philip II. king of Spain, e&s;tabli&s;hed the Inqui&s;ition even on board of &s;hips of war. This bigotted monarch, would,

<P>This tribunal is &s;aid to have been intro|duced by the artifice of John Peres de Saavedra, a native of Corduba, or Jaen, in Spain. We are told that he, having found the &s;ecret to counterfeit apo&s;tolical letters, ama&s;&s;ed, by that means, about thirty thou&s;and ducats, which were em|ployed by him in order to bring the In|qui&s;ition into Portugal, and that in manner following. He a&s;&s;umed the character of Cardinal Legate from the &s;ee of Rome; when forming his hou&s;hold, of one hundred and fifty dome&s;tics, he was received, in the above-mentioned quality, at Seville, and very homo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eably lodged in the archiepi&s;co|pal palace. Advancing after this, towards the frontiers of Portugal, he di&s;patched one of his &s;ecretaries to the king, to ac|quaint him with his arrival; and to pre&s;ent him with fictitious letters from the emperor, the king of Spain, the pope, and &s;everal
<PB N="85" REF="031999_0096_0FF09B9F86FCCD98">other princes both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular; who all intreated his maje&s;ty to &s;avour the legate's pious de&s;igns. The king, overjoy|ed at this legation, &s;ent a lord of his court to compliment him, and attend him to the royal palace, where he re&s;ided about three months. The mock legate having &s;ucceed|ed in his de&s;igns, by laying the foundation of the Inqui&s;ition, took leave of his maje&s;|ty; and departed, greatly &s;atisfied with his atchievement: but, unluckily for him&s;elf, he was di&s;covered on the confines of Ca&s;|tile, and known to have been formerly a dome&s;tic of a Portugueze nobleman. He was then &s;eized, and &s;entenced ten years to the gallies, where he continued a very long time, till, at la&s;t, he was relea&s;ed from thence anno 1556, by a brief from pope Paul IV. This pontiff, who u&s;ed to call the Inqui&s;ition, the grand &s;pring of the papacy, wanted to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>We are told, that the Inqui&s;ition of Por|tugal, was copied from that of Spain, and introduced in the former, anno 1535. But Mr. de la Neuville, in his hi&s;tory of Portu|gal, tom. I. page 59, declares, that the In|qui&s;ition was introduced there anno 1557, under John III. and &s;ettled in the cities of Li&s;bon, Coimbra and Evora.</P>

The Inqui&s;ition has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince in Portugal, and is the mo&s;t &s;evere, the mo&s;t rigid, and cruel of any in the world.</P>

<HEAD>Attempts made to introduce the Inqui&s;ition into England.</HEAD>
<P>ENDEAVOURS were u&s;ed to intro|duce the Inqui&s;ition here, under the reign of queen Mary, &s;i&s;ter to queen Elizabeth. <Q>The ju&s;tices of peace (&s;ays bi&s;hop Burnet) were now every where &s;o &s;lack in the pro|&s;ecution of heretics, that it &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to find out other tools. So the courts of Inqui&s;ition were thought on. The&s;e were &s;et up fir&s;t in France again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, and afterwards in Spain,
<PB N="87" REF="031999_0098_0FF09C118BCB68C0">for di&s;covering the. Moors; and were now turned upon the heretics. Their power was uncontroulable; they &s;eized on any thing they plea&s;ed, upon &s;uch in|formations, or pre&s;umptions as lay be|fore them. They managed their pro|ce&s;&s;es in &s;ecret, and put their pri&s;oners to &s;uch &s;orts of torture, as they thought fit for extorting confe&s;&s;ions or di&s;coveries from them. At this time [in 1557] both the pope and king Philip, tho' they dif|fered in other things, agreed in this, that they were the only &s;ure means for extir|pating here&s;y. So, as a &s;tep to the &s;et|ting them up, a commi&s;&s;ion was given to Bonner, and twenty more, the greate&s;t part lay men, to &s;earch all over England for all &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y, that did not hear ma&s;s, go in proce&s;&s;ions, or take holy bread or holy water: they were authori|zed, three being a quorum, to proceed either by pre&s;entments, or other politic ways: they were to deliver all they di&s;|covered to their ordinaries; and were to u&s;e all &s;uch means as they could invent; which was left to their di&s;cretions and con&s;ciences, for executing their commi&s;|&s;ion. Many other commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ubaltern
<PB N="88" REF="031999_0099_0FF09C56C6D8E248">to theirs, were i&s;&s;ued out for &s;everal counties and dioce&s;es. This was looked on as &s;uch an advance towards an Inqui|&s;ition, that all concluded it would follow ere long.

<P>We find (by bi&s;hop Burnet) that previ|ous to the per&s;ecution under queen Mary, hinted at above, there were con&s;ultations concerning the methods to proceed again&s;t heretics. Cardinal Pool had been &s;u&s;pect|ed to bear &s;ome favour to them formerly, but he took great care to avoid all occa|&s;ions of being any more blamed for this: and indeed he lived in that di&s;tru&s;t of all the Engli&s;h, that he opened his thoughts to very few, for his chief confidents were two Italians who came over with him, Priuli and Ormaneto. Secretary Cecil,
<PB N="90" REF="031999_0101_0FF09C3CB0326CB8">who in matters of religion complied with the pre&s;ent time, was ob&s;erved to have more of his favour than any Engli&s;hman had. Pool was an enemy to all &s;evere pro|ceedings; he thought churchmen &s;hould have the tenderne&s;s of a father, and the care of a &s;hepherd; and ought to reduce, but not devour the &s;tray &s;heep. He had ob|&s;erved, that cruelty rather in&s;lamed than cured that di&s;temper. He thought the bet|ter and &s;urer way, was to begin with an effectual reformation of the manners of the clergy, &s;ince it was the &s;candal given by their ill conduct and ignorance, that was the chief cau&s;e of the growth of here&s;y; &s;o he concluded, that if a primitive di&s;cipline &s;hould be revived, the nation would, by degrees, lay down their prejudices, and might, in time, be gained by gentle methods. Gardiner, on the other hand, being of an abject and cruel temper him&s;elf, thought the &s;trict execution of the laws again&s;t the Lollards, was that to which they ought chiefly to tru&s;t. If the preachers were made public examples, he concluded the people would be ea&s;ily reclaimed; for he pretend|ed, that it was vi&s;ible, if king Henry had executed the act of the &s;ix articles vigorou&s;|ly, all would have &s;ubmitted. He confe&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="91" REF="031999_0102_0FF09BFAE244FAD0">a reformation of the clergy was a good thing, but all times would not bear it.&mdash;If they &s;hould proceed &s;everely again&s;t &s;candalous churchmen, the heretics would take advantage from that, to defame the church the more, and rai&s;e a clamoun again&s;t all clergymen. The queen was for joining both the&s;e councils together; and intended to proceed, at the &s;ame time, both again&s;t &s;candalous churchmen and heretics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, ubi &s;upra, 269, 270, 271.</NOTE> In the cour&s;e of the per&s;ecu|tions, endeavours were u&s;ed, by the diffe|rent parties, to urge the queen to continue them, and to di&s;&s;uade her from the&s;e bar|barities. <Q>At this time (&s;ays bi&s;hop Bur|net) a petition was printed beyond &s;ea, by which the reformers addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to the queen; they &s;et before her the danger of her being carried by a blind zeal, to de&s;troy the members of Chri&s;t, as St. Paul had done before his conver&s;ion. They remembered her of Cranmer's interpo&s;ing to pre&s;erve her life in her father's time. They cited many pa&s;&s;ages out of the books of Gar|diner, Bonner and Ton&s;tall, by which
<PB N="92" REF="031999_0103_0FF09C5BD2DC3770">&s;he might &s;ee that they were not acted [actuated] by true principles of con|&s;cience, but were turned as their fears or intere&s;t led them. They &s;howed her how contrary per&s;ecution was to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel; that Chri&s;tians tolerated Jews; and that the Turks, notwith&s;tanding the barbarity of their tempers, and the cruelty of their reli|gion, yet tolerated Chri&s;tians. They remembered her, that the fir&s;t law for burning in England, was made by Hen|ry IV. as a reward to the bi&s;hops, who had helped him to depo&s;e Richard II. and &s;o to mount the throne. They repre&s;ented to her, that God had tru&s;ted her with the &s;word, which &s;he ought to employ for the protection of her people, and was not to abandon them to the cruelty of &s;uch wolves. The petition al&s;o turned to the nobility, and the re&s;t of the nation; and the danger of a Spa|ni&s;h yoke, and a bloody Inqui&s;ition were &s;et before them.&mdash;Upon this the popi&s;h authors writ &s;everal books in ju&s;tification of the&s;e proceedings. They ob&s;erved, that the Jews were commanded to put bla&s;phemers to death; and &s;aid the heretics bla&s;phemed the body of

<HEAD>A DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF THE INQUISITION, AND <HI>Of the &s;everal things appertaining to it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are, in the dominions of the king of Portugal, four Inqui&s;itions, viz. at Li&s;bon, Coimbra, Evora and Goa, in the Ea&s;t Indies. The juri&s;diction of the la&s;t mentioned extends over all the coun|tries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his Portugueze maje&s;ty on the other &s;ide of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e four Inqui&s;itions, there is a &s;upreme council held in Li&s;bon, to which all the other Portugueze Inqui&s;iti|ons are &s;ubordinate. This tribunal con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="98" REF="031999_0108_0FF09C629F8A4F70">of an Inqui&s;itor General, who is appointed by the king, and confirmed by the pope. He is empowered to nominate the Inqui|&s;itors in all the countries dependant on the crown of Portugal. Under him are five coun&s;ellors, a fi&s;cal proctor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proctor is well known to be much the &s;ame, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, as an attorney is in lay ones. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;ee that the church di&s;cipline be maintained: and to bring to puni&s;hment the di&s;obe|dient. Fi&s;cal &s;ignifies properly what belongs to the exchequer, or king's trea&s;ury; here it is &s;aid to employ a proctor, who, for the &s;ake of, and in the name of the public, is to pro&s;ecute delinquents with regard to matters eccle&s;ia&s;tical.
<P>The author of the Relation of the Inqui&s;ition of Goa, p. 89, &amp; &s;eq. Paris, 1688, 12mo. writes as follows concerning the officers of the Inqui&s;i|tion.</P>
<P><Q>There are at Goa two Inqui&s;itors: the fir&s;t called Inqui&s;itor mor [I &s;uppo&s;e this &s;hould be mayor] or the great Inqui&s;itor, is always a &s;ecular prie&s;t; and the &s;econd a Dominican friar. There likewi&s;e are officers called depudatos. The&s;e are numerous, and of all religious orders. They a&s;&s;i&s;t at the judgment of pri&s;oners, and the draw|ing up of their pro&s;ecutions; but never come to the tribunal, unle&s;s &s;ent for by the Inqui&s;itors. There are other officers &s;tiled Calificadores, who examine &s;uch propo&s;itions as are looked upon to be contrary to the purity of doctrine. The&s;e do not a&s;&s;i&s;t at the judgments, they only making their report with regard to actions committed. There al&s;o is a proctor, an attorney, and advo|cates or coun&s;ellors for &s;uch pri&s;oners as may de&s;ire them. However, the&s;e coun&s;ellors are rather their betrayers than defenders; their chief endeavours being only to draw their &s;ecrets out of them. Be&s;ides, though there were no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their fidelity, yet their favour would be of little benefit to the pri&s;oners; the&s;e coun&s;ellors being never allowed to &s;peak to them, except before the judges, or &s;ome per&s;ons depu|ted by the latter, in order to be pre&s;ent at the&s;e conferences.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There are other officers of the Inqui&s;ition, called familiars, who are, as it were, the &s;erjeants or bailiffs of this tribunal. Per&s;ons of all con|ditions, not excepting dukes and princes, glory in being familiars. The&s;e are employed in &s;eiz|ing per&s;ons impeached; and the u&s;ual rule is, to &s;end a familiar of the &s;ame rank or condition with the per&s;on who is to be &s;eized. The&s;e officers have no &s;alary, they thinking it honour &s;ufficient to &s;erve &s;o holy a tribunal. They wear a medal, on which the arms of the Inqui&s;ition is engraved. They go alone to &s;eize a pri&s;oner; and, when &s;uch a one is told that the Inqui&s;itors have &s;ent for him, he is obliged to follow the familiar in&s;tantly; for, were he to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, every one would a&s;&s;i&s;t the above officer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There likewi&s;e are &s;ecretaries, apparitors call|ed meirinhos, an alcayde or goaler; and guards or attendants to look after the pri&s;oners, carry them food and other things nece&s;&s;ary</Q></P></NOTE> a &s;ecretary
<PB N="99" REF="031999_0109_0FF09BF373E3AD18">of the king's bed chamber, two &s;ecretaries of the council, an alcayde or goaler, a receiver, two reporters, two qualificators, and a great number of &s;ubaltern officers.</P>

This &s;upreme council has an unlimited authority over all the Inqui&s;itors of Por|tugal; they not being permitted to &s;o|lemnize an Auto da F&eacute; without its per|mi&s;&s;ion.

There are, in the Romi&s;h church, two &s;orts of judges in matters of faith. The fir&s;t are &s;o by virtue of the employment with which they are inve&s;ted; &s;uch is the pope and the bi&s;hops, who, immediately after their con&s;ecration, are &s;uppo&s;ed to receive, from heaven, a right and an ab|&s;olute juri&s;diction over heretics.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of judges, are tho&s;e delegated by the pope, who &s;ets him&s;elf up as &s;upreme judge in matters of faith; and gives the judges in que&s;tion an entire juri&s;diction over all heretics and apo&s;tates. The&s;e are called apo&s;tolical Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>This employment is of &s;uch eminence, that tho&s;e who are rai&s;ed to it have the fame title with bi&s;hops: and Clement IV. to do them the greater honour, and en|large their power, freed them from the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hops where they re|&s;ide; making them dependant only on the General Inqui&s;itor of the kingdom. They likewi&s;e may publi&s;h edicts again&s;t here|tics; heighten their puni&s;hment; excom|municate, or take off the excommunica|tion from &s;uch as have incurred it, ex|cept the&s;e are dying.</P>

<P>No prelate, or legate from the &s;ee of Rome, can pronounce &s;entence of excom|munication, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or interdict, again&s;t the Inqui&s;itors and their &s;ecretaries, with|out an expre&s;s order from the pope; to prevent, as is pretended, the affairs of reli|gion from being injured, and heretics from going unpuni&s;hed.</P>

<P>The &s;econd officer of the Inqui&s;ition is the fi&s;cal proctor.

<P>The familiars are the bailiffs or catch|poles of the Inqui&s;ition. Though this is a mo&s;t ignominious employment in all other criminal courts, it yet is looked upon as &s;o honourable in the Inqui&s;ition, that every nobleman in Portugal is a fami|liar of this tribunal. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that per&s;ons of the highe&s;t quality &s;hould be &s;olicitous for this po&s;t, &s;ince the pope has granted, to the&s;e familiars, the like plenary indulgencies as the council of La|teran gave to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould go to the &s;uccour of the holy land again&s;t the in|fidels. They are the &s;atellites of the In|qui&s;itors; they attending on them and de|fending them if nece&s;&s;ary, again&s;t the in&s;ults of heretics. They accompany the execu|to, whenever he goes to &s;eize criminals; and mu&s;t obey all orders given them by the chief officers of the Inqui&s;ition.

<P>A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and coun&s;ellors are per&s;ons &s;killed in the canon and civil law. The Inqui&s;itors con&s;ult them in all difficult points, but follow their opinions no farther

<P>The vi&s;itor is a per&s;on appointed by the Inqui&s;itor General, to in&s;pect all the towns, cities and provinces where commi&s;&s;aries are e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;everal officers of the In|qui&s;ition, the popes have likewi&s;e com|manded, by their bulls, magi&s;trates in ge|neral, to give all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, not only to the Inqui&s;itors; but likewi&s;e to their various &s;ubaltern officers, who may &s;tand in need thereof, in the ex|erci&s;e of their employments, upon pain of their being &s;ubject to eccle&s;ia&s;tical puni&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itors being, as was ob&s;erved, judges delegated by the pope, for enqui|ring into matters of faith, and for extirpa|ting here&s;y; they, upon this &s;pecious pre|tence, are impowered to pro&s;ecute all &s;orts of friars, of what rank or condition &s;oever, either in their own names, by the &s;upreme council of the kingdom, or by the pope.

In &s;ine, they may pro&s;ecute indi&s;crimi|nately, any layman infected with here&s;y, not excepting princes or kings.

<P>A &s;u&s;picion of here&s;y, which is the &s;e|cond ca&s;e, is &s;till more exten&s;ive; for to incur &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, it is enough that a per&s;on only &s;tarts &s;ome propo&s;ition which may offend the hearers; or does not im|peach tho&s;e who advance any &s;uch.

<P>Bla&s;phemy, (the fifth ca&s;e) though very common, and one of the greate&s;t crimes, yet the Inqui&s;itors do not take cognizance of it, except it contains &s;ome here&s;y.

<P>Though neither Jews, Mahomedans, or &s;uch like, are &s;ubject to the Inqui&s;ition, in many things, they yet are obnoxious to it, in all the ca&s;es above-mentioned; tho&s;e crimes not being tolerated in Jews and Mahomedans, &amp;c. more than in Chri&s;tian.

<P>Jews are not allowed to vend, publi&s;h, or even keep the Talmud; or any book, which &s;peaks contemptuou&s;ly of the Chri&s;|tian religion, or is prohibited by the In|qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>In fine; Jews are not permitted to have Chri&s;tian nur&s;es, or to do any thing in contempt of the Romi&s;h religion. The Inqui&s;itors take cognizance of all &s;uch ca&s;es; and puni&s;hes offenders in them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity; &s;o that the dread of this obliges tho&s;e unhappy people to be|come converts to popery. However, &s;uch a conver&s;ion does not make them better men. The&s;e are always di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of new Chri&s;tians, a name which is &s;o much dete&s;ted, that the old Chri&s;|tians can &s;eldom be prevailed upon to
<PB N="117" REF="031999_0127_0FF09C2EB7F2DC58">marry among the new, though the families of the latter had been Chri&s;tians from their great grandfathers. The utter abhorrence in which the&s;e new converts are held, makes them unite more clo&s;ely one with the other, in order to perform mutual &s;ervices, which they could not expect from the old Chri&s;tians: but this very union is commonly the &s;ource of their misfortunes. To illu&s;trate this, I need but ob&s;erve that, if a new Chri&s;tian, who is &s;incerely &s;uch, happens to contract a very &s;trict intimacy with other new Chri&s;|tians, this alone would be &s;ufficient to make him &s;u&s;pected of practi&s;ing Jewi&s;h ceremonies with them, in &s;ecret. In con|&s;equence of this &s;u&s;picion, &s;uch per&s;on is &s;eized by order of the holy office; and accu&s;ed, by the depo&s;ition of &s;ome per&s;on, of being a Jew. Being con&s;cious of his innocence, he &s;latters him&s;elf that nothing will be ea&s;ier for him than to prove it pub|licly; whence he makes no difficulty to comply with the cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Inqui&s;itors, viz. of giving in immediately a complete inventory of all his effects, &amp;c. upon the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that they will be re&s;tored to him, the in&s;tant he &s;hall have ju&s;tified him&s;elf. But he is mi&s;taken; for,
<PB N="118" REF="031999_0128_0FF09C3A30091E80">pre&s;ently after he has given in &s;uch inven|tory, the Inqui&s;itors &s;eize his effects, and &s;ell them publicly by auction. The bare accu&s;ation pronounces him guilty; and he has no other way to e&s;cape the flames, than by making a confe&s;&s;ion, conformably to the articles of the indictment. As his ac|cu&s;er, the witne&s;&s;es, and him&s;elf, are not brought face to face, his innocence is of no &s;ervice. His riches prove his ruin, tho&s;e being certainly &s;eized; and his life would inevitably fall a &s;acrifice, &s;hould he not ac|knowledge him&s;elf a relap&s;ed Jew, though he had always been a zealous Romani&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t ca&s;e &s;ubject to the judgment of the Inqui&s;ition, is of tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t its officers, or any way oppo&s;e its juri&s;diction. As one of the chief max|ims of this tribunal is to &s;trike terror, and to awe &s;uch as are &s;ubject to it; it puni&s;hes with the utmo&s;t &s;everity all who offend its agents and officers. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the &s;lighte&s;t fault is con&s;idered as a heinous crime. Neither birth, employment, dig|nity or rank, can protect.

<PB N="120" REF="031999_0130_0FF09BE514B642E8">of the Inqui&s;itors, though he &s;hould really be innocent. To di&s;obey the command of the Inqui&s;itors, is ever con&s;idered by them as a crime. They always look upon delays to be certain indications of guilt, as &s;howing a dread to appear before the judges. When, therefore, a per&s;on is re|duced to this &s;ad extremity, nothing can &s;ecure him from the mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;h|ment, but a voluntary and perpetual exile: nothing is forgot by the Inqui&s;itors; time cannot obliterate any crime; and pre&s;crip|tion is a thing unknown to them.</P>
<P>It frequently happens, that the Inqui&s;i|tors, either from their con&s;idering the crime of which a per&s;on &s;tands impeached, as enormous, and that they have &s;ufficient evidence again&s;t him: or from their ap|prehending that he may e&s;cape; immedi|ately i&s;&s;ue their orders, without fir&s;t &s;end|ing a &s;ummons, for his being &s;eized, in any place what&s;oever. When this is the ca&s;e, no a&s;ylum or privilege can &s;top, a &s;ingle moment, the pro&s;ecution, nor abate its rigours. The Inqui&s;itors give an order, under their own hands, to the executor, who takes a &s;ufficient number of familiars along with him, to prevent a re&s;cue.</P>

Words could &s;carce de&s;cribe the calami|ty of a man under the&s;e circum&s;tances.

<P>Hence the reader may judge, of the continual apprehen&s;ions with which per|&s;ons, inhabiting countries where the In|qui&s;ition is e&s;tabli&s;hed, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be filled; &s;ince, in order to &s;ecure them|&s;elves from it, one friend is obliged to &s;acrifice another; &s;ons their parents; pa|rents their children; hu&s;bands their wives, and wives their hu&s;bands, by accu&s;ing them to the pretended holy office. How horrid a &s;ource have we here of perfidy and inhumanity! What kind of commu|nity mu&s;t that be, whence gratitude, love, and a mutual forbearance with regard to human frailties, are bani&s;hed!

<P>What idea ought we to form to our&s;elves of a tribunal, which obliges children, not only to &s;tifle every &s;oft impul&s;e of grati|tude, love and re&s;pect due to tho&s;e who gave them birth; but even forces them, upon the mo&s;t rigorous penalties, to be &s;pies over their parents; and to di&s;cover to the mercile&s;s Inqui&s;itors, the crimes, the errors, and even the little lap&s;es to which human frailty &s;o often urges: in a word, a tribunal which will not permit re|lations, when impri&s;oned in its horrid dun|geons, to give each other the &s;uccours, or to perform the duties which religion enjoins.

<P>When a per&s;on is once impri&s;oned by the Inqui&s;itors, his treatment is &s;till more cruel.

<P>Being come to pri&s;on, the Inqui&s;itor, attended by the officers of this mock holy tribunal, goes to the pri&s;oner's abode; and there cau&s;es an exact inventory to be taken of all his papers, effects, and of every thing found in his hou&s;e.

<P>The hou&s;e of the Inqui&s;ition in Li&s;hon.
<PB N="126" REF="031999_0136_0FF09BC6AC617340">is a very &s;pacious edifice. There are four courts, each about forty foot &s;quare, round which are galleries (in the dormi|tory form) two &s;tories high. In the&s;e galleries are the cells or pri&s;ons, being about three hundred. Tho&s;e on the ground-floor are alloted for the vile&s;t of criminals (as they are termed;) and are &s;o many frightful dungeons, all of free|&s;tone, arched over, and very gloomy.

<P>The apartments of the chief Inqui&s;itor, which likewi&s;e are very large, make part of this hou&s;e.

<P>The furniture of the&s;e mi&s;erable dun|geons is, a &s;traw bed, a blanket, &s;heets, and &s;ometimes a mattre&s;s. The pri&s;oner has likewi&s;e a frame of wood about &s;ix feet
<PB N="128" REF="031999_0138_0FF09BBD8AA3BD58">long, and three or four wide. This he lays on the ground, and &s;preads his bed upon it.

He is not, however, allowed any books, not even tho&s;e of devotion.</P>
<P>With regard to provi&s;ions, the Inqui|&s;itors allow every pri&s;oner a te&s;toon, [&s;e|ven pence half-penny Engli&s;h money] per day for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The gaoler, ac|companied by two other officers, vi&s;its, at the end of every month, all the pri&s;on|ers, to enquire of them how they would have their monthly allowance laid out. The pri&s;oner u&s;ually expends nine te&s;toons for part of his provi&s;ions; that is, for a porringer of broth, and half a pound of boiled beef daily; eight te&s;toons for bread, four for chee&s;e, two for fruit, four for brandy, and the re&s;t for oranges, lemons, &s;ugar and wa&s;hing. The gaoler's &s;ecretary, who accompanies him, takes an exact account of what particulars every pri&s;oner reque&s;ts to be provided with during the month; which orders are punc|tually ob&s;erved; the per&s;on who is ap|pointed
<PB N="129" REF="031999_0139_0FF09B92C7086E28">to furni&s;h the pri&s;oners on the&s;e occa&s;ions being puni&s;hed in ca&s;e he in|fringes them.

I my&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed the Inqui|&s;itors for this purpo&s;e, and my reque&s;t was granted.</P>
<P>It is only on &s;uch occa&s;ions, or in &s;ick|ne&s;s, that the Inqui&s;itors &s;how &s;ome little humanity. The&s;e excepted, nothing is found in them, but &s;everity and barbarity. They are quite inflexible; for when once a per&s;on has the misfortune to be their pri&s;oner, he is not only forbid all corre&s;|pondence with his family and friends, (as was ob&s;erved before) but even to make the lea&s;t noi&s;e, to complain, &s;igh, addre&s;s hea|ven aloud, to &s;ings p&s;alms or hymns.&mdash; The&s;e are capital crimes, for which the guards or attendants of the Inqui&s;ition, who are ever walking up and down the pa&s;&s;ages, fir&s;t reprove him &s;everely; but if he happens to make any noi&s;e a &s;econd time, they open his cell, beat him &s;everely; and this, not only to puni&s;h the pri&s;oner
<PB N="130" REF="031999_0140_0FF09C02624A4A30">him&s;elf, but likewi&s;e to intimidate others, who, by rea&s;on of the horrid &s;ilence which reigns, and the proximity of the cells, hear the blows and cries of the wretched victim. I &s;hall here give an in&s;tance of this barbarity, atte&s;ted by &s;everal per&s;ons. A pri&s;oner having a violent cough, one of the guards came and ordered him not to make a noi&s;e; he replied, that it was not in his power to forbear; when his cough increa&s;ing, he was commanded, a &s;econd time, to be &s;ilent; but this being impo&s;&s;i|ble, they &s;tripped the poor creature naked, and beat him &s;o unmercifully, that his cough grew wor&s;e; and the blows being again repeated, he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>By this &s;ilence which the guards or keepers force pri&s;oners to keep, they not only deny them every little con&s;olation, but prevent &s;uch as are neighbours from making the lea&s;t acquaintance; for, the in&s;tant this &s;hould be found, they would be removed to other cells.</P>
<P>They never lodge two pri&s;oners in the &s;ame cell; to prevent, (as the Inqui&s;itors pretend) their con&s;ulting together, in or|der to &s;uppre&s;s or conceal the truth, or to baffle the interrogatories; but the chief
<PB N="131" REF="031999_0141_0FF09B945B97BC68">motive for keeping tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons apart, is to extort from them, by the dread &s;olitude of their confinement, a confe&s;&s;ion of whatever the Inqui&s;itors may require from them.</P>
<P>However, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, two pri|&s;oners are l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dged together in the &s;ame cell; as, for in&s;tance, when a hu&s;band and wife are impri&s;oned for the like crime; and that there is no room to &s;u&s;pect, that one of them will prevent the other from freely confe&s;&s;ing the &s;everal articles of which he or &s;he may &s;tand indicted. When a pri|&s;oner is &s;ick, a companion is given him, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t him as he is told. Like|wi&s;e, when the Inqui&s;itors have not been able to prevail with a pri&s;oner to plead guilty, and that there are no, proofs &s;uf|ficient to convict him; they then &s;end him a companion, who has been taught his le&s;&s;on beforehand, by the officers of the Inqui&s;ition; and this companion art|fully glides into the confidence of the pri|&s;oner; wins his friend&s;hip; and inveighs &s;trongly again&s;t the Inqui&s;itors; accu&s;es them of inju&s;tice, cruelty and barbarity; and, in&s;en&s;ibly, cau&s;es the unhappy victim to join his reproaches, again&s;t the Inqui|&s;itors and the Inqui&s;ition. This is a black
<PB N="132" REF="031999_0142_0FF09BCA0642CC68">and unpardonable crime; and &s;hould the pri&s;oner fall inadvertently into this trap, he would be inevitably undone; for then his companion immediately de&s;ires to be ad|mitted to audience; appears as a witne&s;s again&s;t him; and is no longer his fellow pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>A day or two after a pri&s;oner is brought into his cell, his hair is cut off, and his bead &s;haved. On the&s;e occa&s;ions no di&s;|tinction is made in age, &s;ex, or birth. He then is ordered to tell his name, his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and to make a di&s;covery of what|ever he is worth in the world. To induce him to do this the more readily, the Inqui&s;itor promi&s;es, that, if he be really innocent, the &s;everal things di&s;clo&s;ed by him will be carefully re&s;tored; but that, &s;hould any effects, &amp;c. concealed by him, be afterwards found, they all will be con&s;i&s;cated, though he may be cleared. As mo&s;t of the Portugueze are &s;o weak, as to be firmly per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d of the &s;anctity and integrity of this tribunal. they do not &s;cruple to di&s;cover even &s;uch things as they might mo&s;t ea&s;ily conceal; from a firm belief that every particular will be re&s;tored to them, the moment their inno|cence &s;hall be proved.

In ca&s;e they plead their in|nocence with regard to the crimes of which they &s;tand accu&s;ed, and yet &s;hould be convicted by the witne&s;&s;es who &s;wore again&s;t them, they then would be &s;enten|ced as guilty, and their whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions confi&s;cated. If pri&s;oners, in order to e&s;cape the torture, and in hopes of being &s;ooner &s;et at liberty, own the crime or crimes of which they are impeached, they then are pronounced guilty by their own confe&s;&s;ion; and the public, in gene|ral, think their effects, &amp;c. ju&s;tly con|fi&s;cated. If &s;uch pri&s;oners come forth as repentant criminals, who had accu&s;ed them|&s;elves voluntarily, they yet dare not plead their innocence; &s;ince they thereby would run the hazard of being impri&s;oned again, and &s;entenced, not only as hypocritical pe|nitents; but likewi&s;e as wretches who ac|cu&s;e the Inqui&s;itors of inju&s;tice; &s;o that, what cour&s;e &s;oever the&s;e per&s;ons might take, they would certainly lo&s;e all &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons belonging to them, as the Inqui&s;itors had &s;eized.</P>

Sometimes a pri&s;oner pa&s;&s;es &s;everal months in his cell, without hearing a &s;ingle word of his being brought to trial; without his knowing the crime of which he &s;tands impeached, or a &s;ingle witne&s;s who &s;wore again&s;t him. At la&s;t the gaoler tells him, as of his own accord, that it will be proper for him to &s;ue to be ad|mitted to audience. He then is conducted, for the fir&s;t time, bare-headed to the judges; an under gaoler walking fir&s;t, him&s;elf next, and la&s;tly the gaoler. Being come to one of the doors of the Inqui&s;ition, the fir&s;t mentioned knocks thrice; upon which the door is opened by one of the attendants on, or porter of the Inqui&s;ition. The pri&s;oner, &amp;c. are then commanded to &s;tay in this anti-chamber, until the porter has knocked three times at the door of the great hall of the Inqui&s;ition. This is done in order to give the Inqui&s;itors time to pre|pare for, and to receive the pri&s;oner; that is, for him to di&s;mi&s;s all per&s;ons to whom he may be giving audience; thereby to prevent the pri&s;oners from &s;eeing, or being &s;een, by them.</P>

<P>Then the pre&s;ident bids the pri&s;oner kneel; ordering him at the &s;ame time, to lay his right hand on a book, which is &s;hut. He then addre&s;&s;es the&s;e words to him: <Q>will you promi&s;e to conceal the &s;ecrets of the holy office, and to &s;peak the truth?</Q>&mdash;The pri&s;oner an&s;wering in the affirmative, the pre&s;ident commands him to &s;it down; and afterwards a&s;ks him a great variety of que&s;tions with regard to all &s;uch crimes, as may be committed, cognizable by the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary writes down very accu|rately, the &s;everal interrogatories and an&s;wers; which being done, he rings the little bell, when the pri&s;oner is convey|ed back to his cell, in the &s;ame manner as he had been brought from it; but not till after he has been exhorted, to recollect all the &s;ins he may have committed, ever

When no one would undertake their defence, they were condemned for contumacy; [ridiculous cruelty!] and on the &s;ame day &s;entence was pronounced before the whole univer&s;ity; by which their bodies were ordered to be dug up, and delivered to the queen's officers. An order was afterwards &s;ent, from her maje&s;ty, for inflicting the puni&s;hment. In fine, Feb. 6, the bodies were dug up; when a large &s;take being fixed in the ground, in the market-place, the bodies were tied to it.

<P>HERE follows a &s;uccinct de&s;cription of one &s;olemnized at Madrid, in 1682.</P>
<P>The officers of the Inqui&s;ition, prece|ded by trumpets, kettle-drums, and their banner, marched. May 30, 1682, in cavalcade to the palace of the great &s;quare; where they declared, by proclamation, that on the 30th of June, the &s;entences of the pri&s;oners condemned to the flames, and to other puni&s;hments, would be put in execution. There had not been a &s;pectacle of this kind, in Madrid, during forty years before, for which rea&s;on it was expected, by the inhabitants, with as much impatience as though it had been the merrie&s;t holiday. The 30th of June being come, numberle&s;s multitudes of people appeared, as &s;plendidly dre&s;&s;ed as for a royal wedding. In the great &s;quare was rai&s;ed a high &s;caffold: into this &s;quare, from &s;even in the morning, till nine at night, came criminals of both &s;exes; all the Inqui&s;itions in the kingdom having
<PB N="140" REF="031999_0150_0FF09BBF9E583428">&s;ent their pri&s;oners to Madrid. The pro|&s;ecutions and &s;entences were read aloud. There were twenty Jews, men and wo|men, and one Renegado Mahommedan, who were all burnt. Fifty Jews and Jew|e&s;&s;es having never been impri&s;oned before, and repenting of their crimes, were &s;en|tenced to a long impri&s;onment, and to wear a yellow &s;capulary. Ten more, indicted for bigamy, witchcraft, and other crimes, were &s;entenced to be whipt, and afterwards &s;ent to the gallies; the&s;e wore large pa&s;te-board caps on their heads, with in&s;criptions on them; having halters about their necks and torches in their hands.</P>
<P>The whole court was pre&s;ent: the king, the queen, the emba&s;&s;adors, courtiers, and numberle&s;s multitudes of people.&mdash; The Inqui&s;itor's chair was placed in a &s;ort of tribunal, far above that of the king. The unhappy victims were exe|cuted &s;o near to the place where the king &s;tood, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he could hear their groans; the &s;caffold on which they &s;tood, touching his balcony. The nobles of Spain, acted here the &s;ame part as the &s;heriffs officers in England. Tho&s;e noblemen led &s;uch criminals as were to be burnt; and held
<PB N="141" REF="031999_0151_0FF09C24D51A9680">them when they were fa&s;t bound with thick cords; the re&s;t of the criminals being conducted by the familiars, or common &s;ervants of the Inqui&s;ition. Several friars, both learned and ignorant, argued with great vehemence, to convince the&s;e un|happy creatures of the truth of the Chri&s;|tian religion. Some of tho&s;e criminals (Jews) were perfectly well &s;killed in their religion: and made the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing replies, and that without the lea&s;t emotion. Among them was a maiden of exqui&s;ite beauty, and but &s;eventeen years of age; who being on the &s;ame &s;ide with the queen, addre&s;&s;ed her, in hopes of obtaining her par|don, as follows; <Q>Great queen! will not your royal pre&s;ence be of &s;ome &s;ervice to me in my mi&s;erable condition? have re|gard to my youth; and con&s;ider that I profe&s;s a religion which I imbibed from my infancy.</Q> The queen turned away her eyes, and though &s;he &s;eemed greatly to pity her di&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;he did not dare to &s;peak a word in her behalf.</P>
<P>Now ma&s;s began, in the mid&s;t of which the prie&s;t came from the altar, and &s;eated him&s;elf in a chair prepared for that pur|po&s;e. The chief Inqui&s;itor de&s;cended from the amphitheatre, dre&s;&s;ed in his
<PB N="142" REF="031999_0152_0FF09BAD361CCC68">cope, and having a mitre on his head; when, after bowing to the altar, he ad|vanced towards the king's balcony; went up to it by the &s;tairs, at the end of the &s;caffold; attended by &s;ome officers of the Inqui&s;ition, carrying the cro&s;s and the go&s;pels; with a book containing the oath by which the kings of Spain oblige them|&s;elves to protect the catholic faith; to extirpate heretics; and to &s;upport, with all their power, the pro&s;ecutions of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The king &s;tanding up, bareheaded, ha|ving, on one &s;ide, the con&s;table of Ca&s;tile, who held the royal &s;word lifted, &s;wore to maintain the oath, which was read by a coun&s;ellor of the royal council. His ma|je&s;ty continued his po&s;ture till the In|qui&s;itor returned to his place; when a &s;ecretary of the Inqui&s;ition mounted a &s;ort of pulpit, and read the like oath, admi|ni&s;tering it to the coun&s;ellors and the whole a&s;&s;embly. Ma&s;s began about twelve, and did not end till nine at night, becau&s;e of the &s;entences of the &s;everal criminals: they being all read, aloud, one after another. The intrepidity with which tho&s;e haple&s;s pri&s;oners &s;uffered death was very a&s;toni&s;hing. Some threw them&s;elves into
<PB N="143" REF="031999_0153_0FF09BE7B6B0CF08">the fire; others burnt their hands, and afterwards their feet, thru&s;ting them into the flames, and holding them therein with &s;o much re&s;olution, that many were &s;orry &s;uch heroic &s;ouls were not enlightened by the go&s;pel.

<P>The learned Doctor Geddes, vol. I. page 447, and &s;eq. of his tracts, thus de&s;cribes an Auto da F&eacute; in Li&s;bon, of which he him&s;elf was a &s;pectator.&mdash;The pri&s;oners are no &s;ooner in the hands of the civil magi&s;trate, than they are loaded with chains, before the eyes of the In|qui&s;itors; and being carried fir&s;t to the &s;ecular gaol, are, within an hour or two, brought from thence before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, who, without knowing any thing of their particular crimes, or of the evi|dence that was given in again&s;t them, a&s;ks them, one by one, in what religion they intend to die? If they an&s;wer that they will die in the communion of the church of Rome, they are condemned by him, to be carried forthwith to the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and there to be fir&s;t &s;tran|gled and afterwards burnt to a&s;hes:&mdash;But if they &s;ay, they will die in the prote&s;tant, or in any other faith that is contrary to

<P>At the place of execution, which at Li&s;bon is the Ribera, there are &s;o many &s;takes &s;et up, as there are pri&s;oners to be burnt, with a good quantity of dry furze about them. The &s;takes of the pro|fe&s;&s;ed, as the Inqui&s;itors call them, may be about four yards high; and have a &s;mall board, whereon the pri&s;oner is to be &s;eated, within half a yard of the top. The negative and relap&s;ed being fir&s;t &s;tran|gled and burnt; the profe&s;&s;ed go up a ladder, betwixt the two Je&s;uits, who at|tended them all day: and, when they are come even with the forementioned board, they turn about to the people, and the Je&s;uits &s;pend near a quarter of an hour, in exhorting the profe&s;&s;ed to be reconci|led to the church of Rome; which, if they refu&s;e to be, the Je&s;uits come down, and the executioner a&s;cends; and having turned the profe&s;&s;ed off the ladder upon the &s;eat, and chained their bodies clo&s;e to the &s;take, he leaves them; and the Je&s;uits go up to them a &s;econd time, to renew their exhortation to them; and at parting tell
<PB N="146" REF="031999_0156_0FF09BD89B253800">them, that they leave them to the devil, who is &s;tanding at their elbow to receive their &s;ouls, and carry them with him into the flames of hell-&s;ire, &s;o &s;oon as they are out of their bodies. Upon this a great &s;hout is rai&s;ed; and as &s;oon as the Je&s;uits are got off the ladder, the cry is; let the dogs beards be made; which is done by thru&s;ting flam|ing furzes fa&s;tened to a long pole, again&s;t their faces. And this inhumanity is com|monly continued until their faces are burnt to a coal; and is always accompanied with &s;uch loud acclamations of joy, as are not to be heard upon any other occa&s;ion; a bull fea&s;t, or a farce, being dull entertainments, to the u&s;ing a profe&s;&s;ed heretic thus inhu|manely.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ed beards being thus made, or trimmed, as they call it in jollity; fire is &s;et to the furze, which is at the bottom of the &s;take, and above which the pro|fe&s;&s;ed are chained &s;o high, that the top of the &s;lame &s;eldom reaches higher than the &s;eat they &s;it on; and if there happens to be a wind, to which that place is much expo&s;ed, it &s;eldom reaches &s;o high as their knees. So that if there is a calm, the profe&s;&s;ed are commonly dead in about half an hour after the furze is &s;et on &s;ire; but
<PB N="147" REF="031999_0157_0FF097DBAA428EC8">if the weather is windy, they are not, after that, dead in an hour and half, or two hours; and &s;o are really roa&s;ted and not burnt to death. But though, out of hell, there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a more lamentable &s;pectacle than this, being joined with the &s;ufferers (&s;o long as they are able to &s;peak) cries, viz. Mi&s;erecordia por amor de Di|os, "Mercy for the love of God;" yet it is beheld by people of both &s;exes, and all ages, with &s;uch tran&s;ports of joy and &s;atisfaction, as are not, on any other oc|ca&s;ion to be met with.&mdash;Thus far Doctor Geddes, who ob&s;erves, p. 450, (a very remarkable circum&s;tance,) <Q>That this in|human joy is not the effect of natural cruelty, but ari&s;es from the &s;pirit of their religion; a proof of which is, that all public malefactors, except heretics, are no where more tenderly lamented than by the Portugueze; and even when there is nothing in the manner of their deaths that appear inhuman or cruel.</Q></P>

<HEAD>The Solemnization of the <HI>Auto da F&eacute;</HI> in which <HI>JOHN COUSTOS</HI> had the ill fate to walk.</HEAD>
<P>A FORTNIGHT before the &s;olem|nization of this Auto da F&eacute;, notice was given in all the churches, that it would be celebrated on Sunday the 21&s;t June 1744. At the &s;ame time, all who intended to be &s;pectators thereof, were exhorted not to ridicule the pri&s;oners, but rather pray to God for their conver&s;ion. On Saturday the 20th of the month above-mentioned, we were all ordered to get ready by next morning; and, at the &s;ame time, a band was given to each of us, and old black cloathes to &s;uch as had none.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e accu&s;ed of Judai&s;m, and who, through fear of the torture, confe&s;&s;ed their being &s;uch, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by large &s;capularies called &s;an benidos. This is a piece of yellow &s;tuff, about two ells long; and in the middle of which a hole is made, to put the head through: on it were &s;owed &s;tripes of red &s;tuff, and this falls behind and before, in form of a St. Andrew's cro&s;s. Tho&s;e who are condemned for

They are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by wearing a pa&s;teboard cap, about a foot and half high, on which devils and flames are painted; and, at the bottom, the word WIZARD is writ in large characters.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that all &s;uch per&s;ons as are not &s;entenced to die, carry a lighted yellow wax taper in their hands. I was the only per&s;on to whom one was not given, on account of my being an ob&s;ti|nate prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>The relap&s;ed Jews, and &s;uch heretical Roman Catholies, as are &s;entenced to die for refu&s;ing to confe&s;s the crimes whereof they are accu&s;ed, are dre&s;&s;ed in grey &s;amaras, much &s;horter than the fan benidos above-mentioned. The face of the per&s;on who wears it, is copied (before and behind) from the life, &s;tanding on &s;ire|brands; with flames curling upwards, and devils round it, at the bottom of the &s;a|mara, their names and &s;urnames are writ.</P>

<PB N="150" REF="031999_0160_0FF09BB413E2E1A0">Friars, preceded by the banner of their order. Afterwards came the banner and crucifix of the Inqui&s;ition, which was fol|lowed by the criminals, each whereof walk|ed between two familiars, who were to be an&s;werable, for them, and bring back to pri&s;on, &s;uch as were not to be executed, after the proce&s;&s;ion was ended.</P>
<P>The accompanying pri&s;oners on the&s;e di&s;mal occa&s;ions is thought &s;o great an ho|nour, that &s;uch as attend, to execution, the&s;e unhappy victims, and even lean up|on them, are always the fir&s;t noblemen in the kingdom; who are &s;o proud of acting in this character, that they would not re|&s;ign that honour for any other that &s;hould be offered them, &s;o cruelly blind is their zeal.</P>
<P>Next came the jewi&s;h converts, followed by &s;uch as were indicted for witchcraft and magic, and had confe&s;&s;ed their crimes.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed with the unhappy wretches who were &s;entenced to the flames.</P>
<P>The march then began, when the whole proce&s;&s;ion walked round the court of the chief Inqui&s;itor's palace, in pre&s;ence of the king, the royal family, and the whole court, who were come thither for this purpo&s;e. The pri&s;oners being all gone through the
<PB N="151" REF="031999_0161_0FF09BDB6A788B18">court ju&s;t mentioned, proceeded along one of the &s;ides of Rocio Square; and went down Odreyros-Street; when, returning by E&s;cudeyros-Street, and up another &s;ide of Rocio-Square, they came, at la&s;t, to St. Dominick's church, which was hung, from top to bottom, with red and yellow tape&s;try.</P>
<P>Before the high altar was built an am|phitheatre, with a pretty con&s;iderable num|ber of &s;teps, in order to &s;eat all the pri|&s;oners and their attendant familiars. Op|po&s;ite was rai&s;ed another greater altar, af|ter the romi&s;h fa&s;hion, on which was placed a crucifix &s;urrounded with &s;everal lighted tapers, and ma&s;s books. To the right of this was a pulpit, and to the left, a galle|ry, magnificently adorned, for the king, the royal family, the great men of the kingdom, and the foreign mini&s;ters, to &s;it in. To the right of this gallery was, a long one, for the Inqui&s;itors; and between the&s;e two galleries, a room, whither the Inqui&s;itors retire to hear the confe&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who, terrified at the horrors of im|pending death, may be prompted to con|fe&s;s what they had before per&s;i&s;ted in deny|ing; they &s;ometimes gladly &s;natching this
<PB N="152" REF="031999_0162_0FF09BBA11F98448">la&s;t moment allowed them to e&s;cape a cruel exit.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on being thus &s;eated in the church, the preacher a&s;cended the pul|pit, whence he made a panegyric on the Inqui&s;ition; exhorted &s;uch pri&s;oners as were not &s;entenced to die, to make good u&s;e of the clemency indulged them, by &s;incerely renouncing that in&s;tant, the he|re&s;ies, and crimes of which they &s;tood con|victed. Then directing him&s;elf to the pri|&s;oners who were to be burnt, he exhorted them to make a good u&s;e of the little time left them by making a &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion of their crimes, and thereby avoiding a cruel death.</P>
<P>During the &s;ermon, the pri&s;oners have &s;ome refre&s;hments; the open air having a very &s;trong effect on mo&s;t, and the length of the march fatiguing them great|ly. On this occa&s;ion dry fruits are gi|ven them, and as much water as they can drink.</P>
<P>The preacher being come from the pulpit, &s;ome prie&s;ts belonging to the In|qui&s;ition a&s;cend it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to read the trial of each pri&s;oner, who was &s;tand|ing all the time holding a lighted taper.
<PB N="153" REF="031999_0163_0FF09C1D9820FC98">Each pri&s;oner, after hearing it returned to his place. This la&s;ted till ten at night.</P>
<P>The trials of all the pri&s;oners not &s;en|tenced to die, being read, the pre&s;ident of the Inqui&s;ition, dre&s;t in his &s;acerdotal ve&s;t|ments, appeared with a book in his hand; after which five or &s;ix prie&s;ts, in &s;urplices, tapped, with a &s;ort of wands, the heads and &s;houlders of the pri&s;oners in que&s;tion: &s;aying certain prayers u&s;ed in the Romi&s;h church, when the excommunication is ta|ken off.</P>
<P>Then another prie&s;t went up into the pulpit, to read the trials of the ill-fated per&s;ons &s;entenced to the flames; after which the&s;e &s;ad victims were delivered up to the &s;ecular power, who&s;e officers take them to the Relacaon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;enate-hou&s;e, or court of judicature.</NOTE> whither the king comes.

Afterwards the king appeared, in a &s;orry coach, at which were ropes in&s;tead of harne&s;&s;es. He then ordered the friars to exhort each of the victims in que&s;tion, to die in the Romi&s;h faith, upon pain of being burnt alive; but to declare, that &s;uch as complied with the ex|hortation of the prie&s;t, &s;hould be &s;trangled before they were committed to the flames.

<P>The in&s;tant the &s;ad victims above-men|tioned were delivered up to the &s;ecular arm, all the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners wereded back, with the like ceremony, about ten at night, from St. Dominick's church to the Inqui&s;ition. Being arrived there, we were carried through &s;everal galleries, till
<PB N="156" REF="031999_0166_0FF09BF8906A6868">we came to the abode allotted us. Here were &s;everal chambers, the doors of which were open; when each of us cho&s;e that which he liked be&s;t. There then were given to each a &s;traw bed, a blanket, and &s;heets which had been laid in. Mo&s;t of the&s;e things were far from clean, there not having been an Auto da F&eacute; for two years before. The women were lodged a &s;tory above us.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ettled, to the be&s;t of our power, we thought our&s;elves the happie&s;t per&s;ons upon the earth, though we had little to boa&s;t of.

The alcayde or gaoler, and his brother-keeeper brought each of us a loaf, a cake, and water &s;ufficient for the whole company; permitting us, at the &s;ame time, to divert our&s;elves, provided we did not make a noi&s;e.

<P>I am to ob&s;erve that, from the time of our returning from the proce&s;&s;ion, we were &s;upported at the expence of the Cardinal-Inqui&s;itor, and not at that of the mock holy office. We were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of this change of ma&s;ters, not only by the advantages de&s;cribed above; but al&s;o by the permi&s;&s;ion allowed us, of &s;ending to our relations and friends, for &s;uch provi|&s;ions as we might want, if we did not like tho&s;e given us; or had not enough to &s;a|tisfy our appetites. It would be the high|e&s;t ingratitude in me not to mention the very e&s;&s;ential favours which I my&s;elf, as well as the three brethren, my fellow pri|&s;oners, received from the Free-Ma&s;ons at Li&s;bon. The&s;e could not be ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> till they had obtained leave to vi&s;it us, which gave us inexpre&s;&s;ible joy; and their bounty proved of the mo&s;t &s;ignal advan|tage to us.

How|ever,
<PB N="158" REF="031999_0168_0FF09C3EC3774C70">the true cau&s;e of it was, that each of us might be the more ea&s;ily conveyed to the place to which he was doomed by his &s;entence; to put into our hands a bill of the expences the Inqui&s;itors had been at; and to give the various officers the in|&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary, for conveying us after|wards to the &s;everal places appointed by the Inqui&s;itors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> GALLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Portugueze Galley is a pri&s;on &s;tan|ding by the river &s;ide, and con&s;i&s;ts of two very &s;pacious rooms built one over the other. That on the ground floor is the apartment of the &s;laves, and the other is for the &s;ick, and the officers of this pri&s;on; it being the receptacle, not only of &s;uch as are condemned by the Inqui&s;itors, but like|wi&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="031999_0169_0FF09C32B29E4C38">by the lay judges. Among the&s;e pri|&s;oners are Turks and Moors, taken on board the cor&s;air ve&s;&s;els; together with fu|gitive &s;laves, and bad or villainous &s;ervants, whom their ma&s;ters &s;end to this galley, as a cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal pri&s;oners, of what qua|lity &s;oever, are employed in tolls equally low and grievous. Some work in the dock yards; they carrying timber to the carpenters, unloading the &s;hips, and providing water and provi&s;ions for victualling &s;uch as are outward bound.&mdash; They likewi&s;e carry water to the pri|&s;ons in Li&s;bon; and to the king's gar|dens, in order for refre&s;hing them; in a word, they are obliged to &s;ubmit to any labours, how ignominious and pain|ful &s;oever, for the &s;ervice of his Portugueze maje&s;ty, or of the officers who command over them. The&s;e &s;laves are treated with the greate&s;t &s;everity and cruelty, except they find means to bribe their over&s;eers to gentlene&s;s, by giving them, at intervals, a little money.</P>
<P>In this Galley, all the &s;laves are fa&s;ten|ed two and two, by one foot only, with a chain eight foot long. At their girdle
<PB N="160" REF="031999_0170_0FF09C09688ADC48">is an iron hook, by which they &s;horten or lengthen their chain, to make the weight of it le&s;s trouble&s;ome. Their heads and beards are &s;haved once a month. They wear coar&s;e blue cloaths, caps and coats; and have a great coat, made of coar&s;e &s;erge of the &s;ame colour, which &s;erves them as a cloak in the day time, and a coverlet at night. They lie in a &s;ort of frame of boards rai&s;ed a little from the ground over which a mat is &s;pread.</P>
<P>To every Galley &s;lave is given, each day, a pound and a half of very dry, black bi&s;cuit; with &s;ix pounds of &s;alt meat every month, and a bu&s;hel of pea&s;e, lentils or beans, which they are allowed to &s;ell; in order to purcha&s;e better provi&s;ions, if they can afford it.</P>
<P>They are led early every morning, a &s;ew fe&s;tivals excepted, whither&s;oever their drudgery may be wanted. They then toil ince&s;&s;antly till eleven, when they leave work, in order to eat and re&s;t them&s;elves till one; after which they again renew their mi&s;erable labours, and the&s;e they carry on till night, when they are conducted back to the Galley.

<HEAD>EXAMPLES OF THE INJUSTICE <HI>and</HI> CRUELTY OF THE INQUISITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE pretended zeal of the Inqui&s;itors, for pre&s;erving religion in all its purity, is merely a cloak to hide their boundle&s;s am|bition, their in&s;atiable thir&s;t of riches, and their vindictive &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The emperor Frederic, mentioned in the foregoing pages, who fir&s;t inve&s;ted the Inqui&s;itors with great privileges, was the fir&s;t who made the mo&s;t cruel abu&s;e of them. All who oppo&s;ed his will were deemed heretics, and judged and burnt as &s;uch. He committed to the flames, upon the fal&s;e pretence of here&s;y, &s;o great a
<PB N="164" REF="031999_0174_0FF097D9C89F0800">number of Romani&s;ts, that pope Gregory could not forbear repre&s;enting to him in the mo&s;t &s;erious terms; that it became him to extirpate heretics only, and not the true &s;ons of the church.</P>
<P>The monarch in que&s;tion did not fore|&s;ee that the court of Rome might turn tho&s;e very weapons again&s;t him which he had employed &s;o unju&s;tly again&s;t a mul|titude of Chri&s;tians. This emperor was afterwards &s;en&s;ible of his error, but too late; for he him&s;elf was in 1239 impeach|ed as a heretic; and being judged, was excommunicated as &s;uch; and his &s;ub|jects freed from the allegiance they had &s;worn to him; though his here&s;y was no more, than his having oppo&s;ed the un|limited power which the popes pretended to exerci&s;e over all Chri&s;tians, not except|ing even crowned heads.</P>
<P>Elezine, lord of Padua, who&s;e here&s;y was only too great attachment to the emperor Frederic, was likewi&s;e excom|municated, and Inqui&s;itors appointed to pro&s;ecute him for this pretended crime. Accordingly he was &s;ummoned to appear in Rome, whither he &s;ent per&s;ons of reputation to declare his innocence.&mdash; However, the&s;e were not allowed to be
<PB N="165" REF="031999_0175_0FF09C46594EF930">heard, the pope in&s;i&s;ting that he &s;hould appear in per&s;on; and, upon his refu&s;ing to obey this order, the Roman pontiff &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Trevi&s;o to inform Elezine, that he would render him&s;elf obnoxious to all the puni&s;hments inflicted on heretics, in ca&s;e he refu&s;ed to appear per&s;onally in Rome, &s;ometime in Augu&s;t 1251; and further, that if he did not &s;ubmit to all the pope's injunctions, he would be declared infamous and a he|retic; him&s;elf and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;eized, and a cru&s;ade &s;ent again&s;t him and his ad|herents. In fine, &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t this lord in 1254, whereby he was pronounced a heretic, and all his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions confi&s;cated in favour of his brother Albert.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, Count de Tou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e fell a victim to the cruel power of the Roman pontiffs and their wicked agents. His dominions were &s;acked by cru&s;aders, whom the pope had &s;ent out again&s;t him. In fine, this Count, though a zealous Romani&s;t, could find no other way to extricate him&s;elf, than by making a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, too mean and &s;evere for a prince, who&s;e only crime was his &s;trong attachment to Frederic,
<PB N="166" REF="031999_0176_0FF097ECEC924B28">then at variance with the court of Rome; and his not per&s;ecuting his own &s;ubjects, who were accu&s;ed, by that court, of he|re&s;y.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Inqui&s;itors cited Jane, daughter of the emperor Charles V. to appear before their tribunal; in order to be examined concerning another per&s;on, with regard to &s;ome articles of faith, which the Inqui&s;itors declared were here|tical. The emperor him&s;elf &s;tood in &s;uch awe of the Inqui&s;ition, that he command|ed his daughter, in ca&s;e &s;he thought the per&s;on accu&s;ed ever &s;o little guilty, not to delay her information, in order to avoid the &s;entence of excommunication, levelled not only again&s;t other per&s;ons, but even again&s;t him&s;elf. The prince&s;s, in compliance with this command, imme|diately gave in her depo&s;ition to Valdes, archbi&s;hop of Seville, then Inqui&s;itor-General.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;ition of Arragon proceeded to &s;till greater lengths; it having the in&s;o|lence to pro&s;ecute Don Carlos, elde&s;t &s;on to Don John II. king of Arragon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cabrera hi&s;t, de Don Juan.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="031999_0177_0FF09C530AA78A00">
The Inqui&s;ition of Ca&s;tile di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf in a manner equally daring and hor|rid; this tribunal attempted to pro&s;ecute the memory of the emperor Charles V. and to &s;entence his will to the flames, as here|tical; together with all tho&s;e per&s;ons who had had the greate&s;t &s;hare in this monarch's friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Here follows a &s;uccinct account of this incident, as related by Thaunus, d'Aubig|n&eacute;, and le Laboureur.</P>
<P>This emperor's retreat had given ri&s;e to various reports. One of the&s;e was, that he had contracted, by his almo&s;t continual corre&s;pondence with the pro|te&s;tants of Germany, an inclination for their opinions; and yet the &s;ole motive of his withdrawing to a &s;olitude, was, that he might have an opportunity of ending his days in exerci&s;es of piety conformable to his &s;ecret di&s;po&s;ition. It was likewi&s;e affirmed, that his ill treatment of &s;everal of tho&s;e brave prote&s;tant princes, whom he had &s;ubdued by force of arms, extorted from him &s;uch an admiration of their con|&s;tancy in ill fortune, as made him almo&s;t blu&s;h for his conque&s;ts: and rai&s;ed in him, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, an e&s;teem for their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="031999_0178_0FF09C26924ACCE0">
A circum&s;tance which added to the probability of the&s;e reports, was, his making choice of per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y to be the companions of his retreat, and the directors of his con&s;cience. Doc|tor Caculla was his preacher; and his confe&s;&s;ors-were the archbi&s;hop of Toledo, and e&s;pecially Con&s;tantine Pontius, bi&s;hop of Dro&s;&s;in. This report was &s;trengthened by the great number of pa&s;&s;ages, writ with the emperor's own hand, on the walls of his cell at St. Ju&s;tus' where he died; the&s;e agreeing pretty nearly with the tenets of the prote&s;tants, on ju&s;tification and grace.</P>
<P>But a circum&s;tance which confirmed this opinion &s;till more, was, his will not being drawn up after the manner of the Roman Catholics; I mean that no pious le|gacies were read therein, nor any monies bequeathed for &s;aying ma&s;&s;es, which gave offence to the Inqui&s;itors. However, they did not dare to &s;peak openly on this occa&s;ion, till they &s;hould fir&s;t know the &s;entiments of Philip II. and whether he would not be offended at the pro&s;ecu|tion in que&s;tion; but this prince, on his a&s;cending the throne, &s;igualized him&s;elf by per&s;ecuting all tho&s;e who had &s;hook off
<PB N="169" REF="031999_0179_0FF09BDE05689138">the papal yoke; &s;o that the Inqui&s;itors, in imitation of him, fir&s;t pro&s;ecuted the arch|bi&s;hop of Toledo, primate of Spain, after|wards Caculla, and la&s;t of all Con&s;tantine Pontius.</P>
<P>As the king permitted them to be impri|&s;oned, this was con&s;idered as an undoubted proof of his zeal for the Romi&s;h religion: but the mo&s;t judicious were &s;truck with horror, when they &s;aw the emperor's con|fe&s;&s;or, in who&s;e arms he died, delivered up, by his own &s;on, to a mo&s;t ignominious and cruel puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itors could not forbear &s;howing, that they were prompted to this horrid act, by no other views than tho&s;e of intere&s;t; &s;ince, in the trials of the three per&s;ons above-mentioned, they charged them with being concern|ed in drawing up the emperor's will; and &s;entenced both it, and them, to the flames.</P>
<P>Philip, who hitherto had beheld with the utmo&s;t indifference, the conduct of the Inqui&s;itors, now rou&s;ed as from a lethargy; when reflecting on the bad things the world would &s;ay of him, in ca&s;e he did not &s;top a pro&s;ecution &s;o injurious to the memory of his royal
<PB N="170" REF="031999_0180_0FF09B8E30E43088">father, and which might likewi&s;e be at|tended with fatal con&s;equences, he en|deavoured, &s;ecretly, to &s;top the pro&s;ecu|tion; but employed, at the &s;ame time, gentle expedients, for fear of angering the Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>Don Carlos, only &s;on to king Philip, being a prince of great vivacity; and en|tertaining the utmo&s;t veneration for his grandfather's memory, was highly offended at this in&s;ult put upon it. Not knowing all the extent of the power of this horrid tribunal, he inveighed again&s;t it; and, after blarning his father's weakne&s;s, &s;poke publicly of this de&s;ign of the Inqui&s;itors, as a &s;hocking and unheard of attempt.&mdash; He even went &s;o far, as to threaten to extirpate, one day or other, the Inqui|&s;ition, and all its agents, for this abomi|nable outrage. But this generous prince paid dear for the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions; the Inqui&s;itors being determined to &s;acri|fice him to their vengeance, and ha&s;ten his end.</P>
<P>However, this di&s;pute between the king and the Inqui&s;ition was afterwards adju&s;|ted. Caculla was burnt alive, with the effigy of Con&s;tantine Pontius, who died in pri&s;on &s;ome days before. The arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="171" REF="031999_0181_0FF09C1F35727308">of Toledo appealed to Rome; and extricated him&s;elf by money and friends. After this, no farther mention was made of the emperor's will.</P>
<P>Though this reconciliation might pacify the prince of Spain, the Inqui&s;itors were far from being appea&s;ed; it being one of their chief maxims, never to forgive. In this view, they rai&s;ed &s;o great a &s;pirit of di&s;content among the common people, that the king was forced to remove Don Carlos from court; together with Don John his brother, and the prince of Par|ma, his nephew, who had &s;hared in Don Carlos's ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the In|qui&s;itors.</P>
<P>This cruel tribunal had not yet &s;atiated its revenge. Some years after it imputed to this young prince, as a crime, the com|pa&s;&s;ion he had extended to the inhabitants of the Netherlands, who were treated bar|barou&s;ly. They declared, that as all the people in que&s;tion were heretics, the prince mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be one, &s;ince he &s;et up for their defender. In fine, they gained &s;o &s;trange an a&s;cendant over the king's mind, that he, in&s;pired by a mo&s;t unnatural &s;pirit of bigotry, and being
<PB N="172" REF="031999_0182_0FF09BE0622030D8">afraid of quarrelling with the Inqui&s;itors: &s;entenced his &s;on to die. The only in|dulgence the latter met with on this occa|&s;ion, was to have the &s;pecies of death left to his choice. The ill-fated prince, Ro|man-like, had recour&s;e to the hot bath; when opening the veins of his arms and legs, he died gradually. Thus did this excellent young prince fall a martyr to the mercile&s;s Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>The year 1580 furni&s;hes us with ano|ther very remarkable in&s;tance, of the a&s;&s;uming &s;pirit of this pretended holy tribunal.</P>
<P>Cardinal Charles Borromeo, archbi&s;hop of Milan, who afterwards was canonized, going his vi&s;itation of certain places, in his dioce&s;e, &s;ubordinate to him as to &s;pi|rituals, and to the Swi&s;s cantons as to temporals; thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome regulations for the good of the&s;e churches.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s took umbrage at this con|duct; when, without addre&s;&s;ing the arch|bi&s;hop, they &s;ent an emba&s;&s;ador to the governor of Milan, intreating him not to let the prelate continue his vi&s;itation in the places &s;ubject to them; and to a&s;&s;ure him, that in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, they would employ
<PB N="173" REF="031999_0183_0FF09C34C0A83298">force; which mu&s;t break the harmony it &s;o highly concerned his &s;overeign, the king of Spain to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>The emba&s;&s;ador being arrived in Milan, lodged at a rich merchant's hou&s;e of his acquaintance. The Inqui&s;itor was no &s;ooner informed of this, than, di&s;regard|ing the law of nations, and the fatal con|&s;equences with which &s;o great an outrage might be attended; he went, with all his officers, to the emba&s;&s;ador's abode; when cau&s;ing him to be &s;hackled in his pre&s;ence, he hurried him away to the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition. Though all per&s;ons were &s;truck with horror, at &s;uch an in&s;ult of|fered to a &s;tate in the per&s;on of its emba&s;|&s;ador, yet no one dared to make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. The merchant was the only per&s;on who intere&s;ted him&s;elf in his fa|vour; for he, waiting upon the governor of Milan, told him the cruel u&s;age the emba&s;&s;ador had met with. The governor &s;ent for the Inqui&s;itor, and obliged him to relea&s;e the emba&s;&s;ador that in&s;tant; which being done, he paid him all imagin|able honours, and complied with his &s;eve|ral demands.

The governor afterwards in|formed the archbi&s;hop, by a letter, that the intere&s;t of his catholic maje&s;ty requi|red ab&s;olutely, that he &s;hould di&s;continue his vi&s;itations; which being done, things were quiet.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances here given, prove &s;uffi|ciently, that if the Inqui&s;itors had kept within the bound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which the popes pre|tended to &s;et to them, in e&s;tabli&s;hing their tribunal; (I mean the rooting up of here|&s;y,) and had not concerned them&s;elves with politics; they would not have beha|ved &s;o in&s;olently towards monarchs, &amp;c. Let us now &s;ee &s;ome other examples of their treatment of per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by their birth and employments.</P>
<P>Mark Antonio de Dominis was of a mo&s;t illu&s;trious Venetian family. He fir&s;t entered among the Je&s;uits; was after|wards bi&s;hop of Segni, and at la&s;t arch|bi&s;hop of Spalatro and primate of Dalma|tia. He was thought the be&s;t &s;killed of any man of the age, in every branch of literature; e&s;pecially in divinity and hi&s;|tory, both &s;acred and prophane. This
<PB N="175" REF="031999_0185_0FF09C5FC6F255E8">prelate was con&s;ulted as an oracle, on every &s;ubject, and gave the highe&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction to all queri&s;ts. Imbibing prote&s;|tant principles, he defended them with the utmo&s;t vigour, in his Republica Eccle|&s;ia&s;tica; and at the &s;ame time, wrote with greater vehemence again&s;t the pope and the court of Rome than its mo&s;t inveterate enemies had ever done.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire the prelate had to print this work in his life-time, and the little probability there was of his being able to &s;tay in Italy after its publication, made him retire to Germany; whence he after|wards went to England, whither he was invited by James I. king of Great Britain. Mark Antonio met with a gracious recep|tion from this theological monarch; he giving him an honourable &s;upport; and do|ing all that lay in his power, to engage him to renounce the errors of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>On the other hand the pope, whether he was unwilling to leave a man of &s;o exalted a character, in the hands of the enemies to the Romi&s;h church; or rather, as it afterwards appeared, had re&s;olved to be revenged of, and make a public exam|ple
<PB N="176" REF="031999_0186_0FF09BC230EE0810">of him; &s;et every engine at work, to induce him to return to his native country. At la&s;t, Don Diego Sarmiento da Cunna, the Spani&s;h emba&s;&s;ador at the Briti&s;h court, made Mark Antonio &s;uch &s;plendid offers, that he was prevailed upon to return to Italy.</P>
<P>This unhappy prelate then forgot the maxims he had &s;o frequently inculcated in his works, viz. That no per&s;on can offend the court of Rome with impunity, and that it never pardons an injury: for Mark Antonio, &s;pite of the &s;trong exhor|tations of his friends in England, who were for ever repre&s;enting to him the dangers to which he would inevitably expo&s;e him&s;elf, &s;et out for Rome, where he was no &s;ooner arrived than he found his mi&s;take too late. The pontiff did not keep one of the promi&s;es made to Mark Antonio, but obliged him to abjure publicly the pretended here&s;ies advanced in his books. He was now left, &s;eem|ingly, at liberty; but was ever follow|ed by &s;pies, who, at la&s;t, fal&s;ely &s;wore that he carried on a &s;ecret corre&s;pond|ence with England. Immediately the Inqui&s;itors &s;eized this great man; but carrying on his pro&s;ecution with their u&s;ual
<PB N="177" REF="031999_0187_0FF09BCCA8C35550">dilatorine&s;s, he died in pri&s;on, either thro' grief for the wrong &s;teps taken by him; or through fear of the &s;hameful and cruel puni&s;hment which he was &s;en&s;ible awaited him.</P>
<P>Alph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;o Nobre, born in Vilia Vizi|o&s;a, and de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t ancient and illu&s;trious families of that city, many of whom had filled tho&s;e po&s;ts, which, in Portugal, are be&s;towed on none but noble per&s;ons; and all who&s;e ance&s;tors could not be reproached with the lea&s;t tincture of judai&s;m; was &s;eized and carried to the pri&s;ons of the Inqui|&s;ition of Coimbra, upon the informatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of per&s;ons who &s;wore that he was not a Chri&s;tian. Some time after, his only &s;on and daughter were &s;eized and confined in the &s;ame pri&s;on. The&s;e children, who were very young, impeached their father; whether excited thereto by evil coun&s;el|lors, or that the tortures had extorted the impeachment from them. At la&s;t the unhappy father was &s;entenced to be burnt alive, on the depo&s;itions of his children. The day of the Auto da F&eacute; being come, the &s;on drew near to his parent, to crave forgivene&s;s and his ble&s;&s;ing, but the ill-fated father replied; <Q>I pardon you

<P>In the &s;ame Auto da F&eacute; were likewi&s;e burnt Donna Beatrix Carvalho, of a noble family of Elvas, and wife to Jacomo de Mello; &s;he being &s;entenced to die for judai&s;m, on the oaths of her children. There is no doubt but that, had the In|qui&s;itors acted with &s;incerity and equity, and with a real intention to find out the truth, they might have di&s;covered the innocence of the lady in que&s;tion; as well as that of the above Signior Nobre, by comparing the confe&s;&s;ions which each of
<PB N="179" REF="031999_0189_0FF09B909A94BBB8">their children had made &s;eparately, with the depo&s;itions of the witne&s;&s;es. A wide difference would certainly have been found, on this occa&s;ion, in the facts and circum&s;tances. Truth admits of no variation; and is ever the &s;ame, in the mouths of tho&s;e who follow its dictates. Thus, by confronting them, new lights mu&s;t have been &s;truck out; but then the doing this would not have brought on the confi&s;cation of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the two victims in que&s;tion, the &s;wallowing up of which was the &s;ole view of the Inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>Here follows another in&s;tance of the brutal inju&s;tice of the Inqui&s;itors: Jo&s;eph Pereira Mene&s;es, captain general of his Portugueze maje&s;ty's &s;leets in India, was ordered by the governor of Goa to &s;ail, with his fleet, to the &s;uccour of the city of Diu, then be&s;ieged by the Arabs. Pro|ceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his voyage, he was detained hy contrary winds, at Bacaim; whereby the Arabs had an opportunity of plun|dering Diu, and of coming back laden with rich &s;poils, before the arrival of the &s;uccours brought by Pereira Mene&s;es. This commander being returned to Goa, was immediately &s;eized by order of An|tonio
<PB N="180" REF="031999_0190_0FF09B8811D80610">de Mello de Ca&s;tro, governor of that place, and a &s;worn enemy to Pereira. His pro&s;ecution was then ordered, when he was accu&s;ed of loitering at Bacaim, purpo&s;ely to avoid engaging the enemy; and thus to have cau&s;ed, by his neglect and cowardice, the ruin and plunder of Diu. However, as governors are not permitted to put commanders to death, without fir&s;t obtaining an expre&s;s order from the court of Portugal; Antonio de Mello could not take away his enemy's life; for which rea&s;on he pronounced &s;uch a &s;entence upon him, as was more intole|rable than death it&s;elf to a man of honour. Pereira, pur&s;uant to the judgment pa&s;&s;ed upon him, was led by the common exe|cutioner through the &s;treets, with a halter about his neck, and a di&s;taff at his &s;ide. A herald walking before, cried aloud, That this puni&s;hment was inflicted on him by the king, for being a coward and trai|tor. Pereira was then carried back to pri&s;on, where a familiar of the Inqui&s;ition came and demanded him. This fre&s;h &s;tep &s;urpri&s;ed every one, who knew that he could not ju&s;tly be accu&s;ed of judai&s;m, as he was of an ancient Chri&s;tian family, and had always behaved with honour.&mdash;
<PB N="181" REF="031999_0191_0FF09BF0C132C728">The day of the Auto da F&eacute; was therefore expected with impatience by the people, in order that his crime might be made known to them: but how great was their &s;urpri&s;e, when the pri&s;oner did not come forth in the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Pereira had long been engaged in a quarrel with a gentleman, once his inti|mate friend, and who was &s;eemingly re|conciled to him before this misfortune. This fal&s;e friend, harbouring a &s;ecret re|&s;olution to revenge him&s;elf whenever an opportunity &s;hould offer, thought this im|pri&s;onment of Pereira the mo&s;t favourable for his purpo&s;e, that could have happened. He now &s;uborned five of Pereira's dome&s;|tics, who accu&s;ed their ma&s;ter to the In|qui&s;itors, of &s;odomy; making oath that they had &s;een him perpetrate that abomi|nable crime with one of his pages, who thereupon was &s;eized. The latter, having le&s;s courage than his ma&s;ter; and dreading a cruel death, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not do all he was commanded; and finding no other way to &s;ave his life than by pleading guilty, charged him&s;elf with a crime of which he was entirely innocent; and thus became, pur&s;uant to the practice of the Inqui&s;itors, a fre&s;h witne&s;s again&s;t his ma&s;ter. The
<PB N="182" REF="031999_0192_0FF09B99F85032E0">&s;ervant, by this confe&s;&s;ion, &s;aved his own life, and was bani&s;hed to Mozambique in Africa.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as Pereira per&s;i&s;ted in declaring him&s;elf innocent, he was con|demned to be burnt alive; and would have been committed to the flames, had not his continual prote&s;tations of his in|nocence; or rather a &s;ecret e&s;teem which the Inqui&s;itors ever entertained for him, made them &s;u&s;pend his execution; in or|der to try whether they might not, in time, prevail with him to make a confe&s;&s;ion; or find opportunities to clear up the affair. For this rea&s;on he was ordered to remain in pri&s;on till next Auto da F&eacute;.</P>
<P>During this interval, the Inqui&s;itors ex|amined the pri&s;oner and his witne&s;&s;es &s;eve|ral times; when interrogating the latter &s;eparately, whether the moon &s;hone the night in which, pur&s;uant to their oath, their ma&s;ter committed the dete&s;table crime in que&s;tion, they varied in their an&s;wers. Being now put to the torture, they denied all they before had &s;wore again&s;t their ma&s;|ter. The accu&s;ers were then &s;eized, and Jo&s;eph Pereira being declared innocent, came out of pri&s;on next Auto da F&eacute;, &s;tripped of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and quite
<PB N="183" REF="031999_0193_0FF09BCEA57D9478">ruined. His chief accu&s;er was bani&s;hed during nine years to Africa, and the wit|ne&s;&s;es were &s;entenced to the Galley for five years.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned example &s;hows, that the Inqui&s;itors make here&s;y a pretence, merely to &s;eize upon the wealth of the in|nocent; and that this tribunal gives a wicked man the &s;ine&s;t opportunity po&s;&s;i|ble, to &s;atiate his vengeance.&mdash;The &s;pirit which animates the Inqui&s;itors e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Ea&s;t Indies, mu&s;t really be horrid, &s;ince even the Je&s;uits them&s;elves, thus &s;peak of them, in their univer&s;al Latin and French Dictionary, printed at Tre|voux. <Q>The Inqui&s;ition (&s;ay the&s;e mo&s;t righteous fathers) is va&s;tly &s;evere in India.

The pri|&s;oner mu&s;t accu&s;e him&s;elf, and he never &s;ees, nor is confronted, with tho&s;e who &s;wear again&s;t him. A per|&s;on who happens to let drop the lea&s;t word again&s;t the church; or does not &s;peak, with &s;ufficient reverence of the

<P>The following in&s;tance proves, that the Inqui&s;itors will condemn an innocent per|&s;on rather than permit any of their accu|&s;ations to be di&s;proved.</P>
<P>A major in a Portugueze regiment was charged with profe&s;&s;ing judai&s;m privately, and hurried away to the pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition in Li&s;bon. Being de&s;cended of a family di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of new Chri&s;tians, this proved a great pre|judice again&s;t him. He then was a&s;ked, &s;everal times, the cau&s;e of his &s;eizure, though he him&s;elf was an utter &s;tranger to it. After he was kept in pri&s;on two years, the Inqui&s;itors told him, that he was
<PB N="185" REF="031999_0195_0FF09CA0C3E08208">accu&s;ed and duly convicted, of being a relap&s;ed Jew, which he utterly denied; prote&s;ting that he had been always a true and faithful Chri&s;tian. In a word, they could not prevail with him, either by threats or promi&s;es, to plead guilty to any one article of which he &s;tood impeach|ed: he declaring re&s;olutely to his judg|es, that he would die with innocence, rather than pre&s;erve his life by an action, which mu&s;t cover him with eternal infa|my.</P>
<P>Duke d'Aveyro, then Inqui&s;itor-Gene|ral, who was de&s;irous of &s;aving this officer, being one day upon his vi&s;itation, &s;trongly exhorted him to embrace the opportu|nity he had of extricating him&s;elf; but the pri&s;oner continuing inflexible, the Inqui&s;itor was fired, and &s;poke thus to him: "Do&s;t thou imagine that we'll have "the lie on this occa&s;ion?" The Inqui|&s;itor then withdrew, leaving the pri&s;oner to his reflections on what he had heard. Surely the&s;e words employed a meaning incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of an upright judge, and &s;trongly &s;poke the iniquitous &s;pirit of this tribunal.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Auto da F&eacute; approach|ing, our victim was condemned to the
<PB N="186" REF="031999_0196_0FF09CDAEE7DA450">flames, and a confe&s;&s;or &s;ent to him. Ter|rified at this horrid death, he, though en|tirely innocent, declared him&s;elf guilty of the crime laid to his charge. His po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were then con&s;i&s;cated; after which he was made to walk in the pro|ce&s;&s;ion, in the habit of one relap&s;ed; and la&s;tly, was &s;entenced to the Gallies for five years.</P>
<P>William Lithgow, a Scotchman, had ever retained a &s;trong inclination for tra|vel. To gratify it, he fir&s;t went to Ma|laga, and there agreed with the captain of a French &s;hip, to carry him to Alexandria. Before this &s;hip &s;et &s;ail, an Engli&s;h fleet, fitted out again&s;t the Algerines, came and ca&s;t anchor before Malaga, the 7th of October, 1620; which threw the whole city into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation; the&s;e &s;hips being &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to Mahom|medans. However, next morning, they found their mi&s;take; when the governor &s;eeing the Briti&s;h cro&s;s in the flags, went on board the &s;hip of the Admiral, Sir Robert Man&s;el, who received him with the greate&s;t politene&s;s; &s;o that at his return, he removed the fears of the in|habitants, and made them lay down their arms. On the morrow, &s;everal of the
<PB N="187" REF="031999_0197_0FF09C8A39E34E30">crew came on &s;hore; and being Lithgow's particular friends, &s;pent &s;ome days in viewing the curio&s;ities of the city, and in otherwi&s;e diverting them&s;elves; and then inviting him on board, they pre&s;ented him to the admiral, from whom he met with all imaginable civility. They kept Lithgow on board next day after which he returned to Malaga, and the fleet &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>As Lithgow was returning to his quar|ters through bye &s;treets, in order to carry all his things on board the French &s;hip, which was to &s;ail that night for Alexandria; he was &s;eized by nine catchpoles, or offi|cers, who took him before the governor, to whom he complained of the violence which had been done him. The governor an&s;wered only by a nod; and bid certain per&s;ons, with the town &s;ecretary, to go and examine him. This was to be tran&s;|acted with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy, to prevent the Engli&s;h merchants, re&s;iding in Malaga, from bearing of his arre&s;t.</P>
<P>The council a&s;&s;embling, he was exami|ned, and being &s;u&s;pected to be an Engli&s;h &s;py, they did all that lay in their power to make &s;ome di&s;covery to that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="188" REF="031999_0198_0FF09C7A24B990C8">but in vain. They afterwards a&s;ked the names of the captains of the fleet; whether Lithgow, before his leaving England, did not know of the fitting out of this fleet? Why he refu&s;ed the offer which the Engli&s;h admiral made of taking him on board his &s;hip? In a word, they affirm|ed that he was a &s;py; and that he had been nine months in Malaga, in no other view than to give intelligence, to the Engli&s;h court, of the time when the Spani&s;h fleet was expected from India. They then ob&s;erved, that his inti|macy with the officers, and a great many more of his countrymen on board this fleet, who had &s;hewed him the highe&s;t civilities, were &s;trong indications of his guilt.</P>
<P>As Lithgow found it impo&s;&s;ible to era&s;e the&s;e bad impre&s;&s;ions, he intreated them to &s;end for a bag, containing his letters and other papers; the peru&s;al of which, he declared, would prove his innocence. The bag being accordingly brought, and the contents of it examined, they were found to con&s;i&s;t chiefly of pa&s;&s;ports, and te&s;timonials from &s;everal per&s;ons of qua|lity; a circum&s;tance which, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening their &s;u&s;picions, &s;erved only to
<PB N="189" REF="031999_0199_0FF09CA2A030FB68">heighten them. Pre&s;ently a &s;ubaltern officer came into the room to &s;earch him, and took eleven ducats out of his pocket. Stripping him afterwards to his &s;hirt, they found in the wai&s;tband of his bree|ches, the value of 548 ducats, in gold. Lithgow putting on his cloaths again, was conducted to a &s;ecure place, and from thence removed to an horrid dun|geon, where he was allowed neither bed nor bedding; and only an ounce and half of mu&s;ty bread, and a pint of water daily.</P>
<P>As he would confe&s;s nothing, he was put to the torture three days after. The wretches had the inhumanity to make him undergo, in the &s;pace of five hours, fifty different &s;orts of torture; after which he was remanded back to pri&s;on, where two eggs were given him, and a little hot wine, ju&s;t to keep him alive.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion he received from a Turk, favours which he could not have hoped from per&s;ons who &s;tile them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. This Turk admini&s;tered to him all the con&s;olation po&s;&s;ible, and wept to &s;ee the cruelties exerci&s;ed on Lithgow. He then informed him, that certain En|gli&s;h prie&s;ts belonging to a &s;eminary, toge|ther
<PB N="190" REF="031999_0200_0FF09C7C8A181B40">with a Scotch cooper, had been &s;ome|time employed by the governor's order, in tran&s;lating into Spani&s;h, all his books, and the ob&s;ervations made by him in his travels. The Turk added, that it was publicly reported, that he was a mo&s;t notorious heretic. It was then, Lithgow naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that every engine would be &s;et at work, in order to ruin him.</P>
<P>Two days after, the governor, with the Inqui&s;itor and two Je&s;uits, came to Lith|gow in pri&s;on; when after a&s;king him &s;everal que&s;tions, and &s;trongly urging him to change his religion, they declared, that, having fir&s;t &s;eized him as a &s;py, they had di&s;covered, by the tran&s;lation of his papers, that he ridiculed the ble&s;&s;ed lady of Loretto; and &s;pake very irreverently of his holine&s;s, Chri&s;t's vicegerent upon earth: that informations had been lodged again&s;t him before the Inqui&s;itors; that he &s;hould be allowed eight days to return to the pale of the church; during which the Inqui&s;itor him&s;elf, and other prie&s;ts, would give him all the in&s;tructions nece&s;|&s;ary, to extricate him from his mi&s;erable &s;tate. They vi&s;ited him again &s;everal times, but without &s;ucce&s;s. In fine, the
<PB N="191" REF="031999_0201_0FF09C9785410FF0">eighth day being come, he was &s;entenced to undergo eleven different tortures; when, in ca&s;e he &s;urvived them, he was to be carried to Granada, and burnt there, after ea&s;ter holidays. The &s;ame evening he was put to the torture, and bore it with great re&s;olution, though the utmo&s;t cruelty was practi&s;ed on this occa&s;ion. He then was remanded to his dungeon, where &s;ome Turki&s;h &s;laves brought him, &s;ecretly, refre&s;hments, which he was too weak to take. One of the&s;e &s;laves, though educated in the Mahommedan religion from his infancy, was &s;o &s;trongly affected with the deplorable condition to which Lithgow was reduced, that he fell &s;ick for &s;everal days. However, a Moori&s;h female &s;lave amply compen&s;ated for the kind Turk's ab&s;ence; &s;he being allowed more liberty in the pri&s;on. This female &s;lave brought Lithgow, daily, provi&s;ions, with a little wine; and this courte&s;y con|tinued &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>To conclude, at the time that Lithgow expected, every in&s;tant, to die in the mo&s;t cruel torments, he was relea&s;ed by a very unexpected accident. A Spaniard of di&s;tinction being at &s;upper with the go|vernor, the latter informed him of every
<PB N="192" REF="031999_0202_0FF09C72636A1210">thing that had happened to Lithgow, &s;ince his impri&s;onment.

<P>Gon&s;alvius gives us an example, which &s;hows that vice is not the object of the Inqui&s;itors hatred.&mdash;A poor inhabitant of Seville, who &s;upported his family by his daily labour, had the mortification to have his wife kept forcibly from him by a prie&s;t, which yet was winked at by the Inqui&s;ition, and every other tribunal. As this man was one day di&s;cour&s;ing concern|ing purgatory, with &s;ome of his acquain|tance, he &s;poke in &s;uch terms, as though he intended only to di&s;burden his mind: As to my&s;elf, (&s;ays he) I have my pur|gatory in this world, by my wife's being thus with-held from me by the prie&s;t. The&s;e words being told to the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, he impeached the hu&s;band to the Inqui|&s;ition, as having advanced &s;ome errors relating to the doctrine of purgatory. Hereupon the Inqui&s;itors, without once reproaching the prie&s;t for his crime, &s;ei|zed the hu&s;band. The latter then was impri&s;oned two years; and, after walking

The&s;e carried their cruelties to &s;uch lengths, as to confi&s;cate, to the u&s;e of their tribunal, the little that this unhappy creature had in the world, and permitted the prie&s;t to &s;till enjoy his wife; the holy lecher being pa&s;&s;ionately fond of her.</P>

<P>PLACED (unworthy as we are) by the di&s;po&s;al of the Divine clemeney, in the eminent watch-tower of the apo&s;tle&s;hip, we are ever &s;olicitou&s;ly intent, agreeable to the tru&s;t of the pa&s;toral providence repo&s;ed in us, by ob&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;ages of error and vice, to pre&s;erve more e&s;pecially the inte|grity of orthodox religion, and to repel, in the&s;e difficult times, all dangers of trouble from the whole catholic world.</P>
<P>It has come to our knowledge, even from public report, that certain &s;ocieties, companies, meetings, a&s;&s;emblies, clubs, or conventicles, commonly called De Liberi Muratori, or Free-Ma&s;ons, or by what&s;o|ever other name the &s;ame in different lan|guages are di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;pread far and wide, and are every day increa&s;ing; in which per&s;ons, of whatever religion or &s;ect, contented with a kind of an affected &s;hew of natural hone&s;ty, confederate together in a clo&s;e and in&s;crutable bond, according to laws and orders agreed upon between them;
