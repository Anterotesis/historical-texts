<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AUSPICIOUS to the be&s;t hopes of Americans, for the univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s of Republican liberty, the re|volving year, 1800, pre&s;ents you with the periodical right of &s;uffrage in the election of a Pre&s;ident of the U. States.</P>
<P>The magnitude of this right, and the deep intere&s;ts it involves for the fate and happine&s;s of our common country, demand your immediate, vigilant, uncea&s;ing and deliberate attention. Impartial, firm and indepen|dent, it remains with you to vindicate the rights of Re|publican liberty, and to crown with &s;ucce&s;s the noble&s;t and faire&s;t experiment the world has ever yet &s;een, attempted by freemen, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;elf-government.</P>
<P>The probationary period of ten years, &s;ince the in&s;titution of a foederal government, affords much ground to hope and fear, amid&s;t that continued con|cu&s;&s;ion of nations which &s;till agitates the European world, and threatens to involve our we&s;tern hemi&s;|phere in its ruinous vortex. Your &s;acrifices for peace and the virtuous efforts of your republican &s;ons, have, hitherto pre&s;erved you from the fatal cur&s;e and ca|lamity of war.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing, with mi&s;led confidence, the mea&s;ures of men, who&s;e ho&s;tility to the fundamental principles of your government, conceived the only hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="036917_0003_100B324A4FD0F728">amid&s;t &s;cenes of war and confu&s;ion, you have been placed, more than once, on the precipice of de&s;truction. Seceding from the principles avowed to the world as the ba&s;is of your republican in&s;titutions, the pillars of ari&s;tocracy have ari&s;en, and in the dire|lection of American truths, the world has been a&s;to|ni&s;hed at your <HI>retrograde</HI> turn and rapid advance to monarchy.</P>
<P>A review of pa&s;t events will but pre&s;ent the painful &s;pectacle of political apo&s;tacy, amid&s;t the wreck of principle: and the creation of &s;y&s;tems equally &s;ub|ver&s;ive of liberty, peace and happine&s;s&mdash; Suffice it to &s;ay, that new and unheard of doctrines have been advanced, precedents e&s;tabli&s;hed, and laws enacted, which go to &s;ap the very foundations of public liberty &mdash;Hence have we &s;een, in the abandonment of con|&s;titutional truth and principle, con&s;tructive trea&s;on avowed, and the right of trial by jury of the vicinage exploded in our courts of ju&s;tice, whil&s;t our legi&s;lative acts have begotten new and arbitrary principles of alieni&s;m and &s;edition, with an extended and boundle&s;s &s;y&s;tem of common law, adopted by a foreign nation, and never yet incorporated into any American code. And our executive functionaries have not been &s;lothful in pur&s;uing, under colour of law, per&s;ecutions and pro&s;criptions of per&s;onal di&s;qualifications for political opinions, and re&s;traints on the liberty of the pre&s;s&mdash; Or in promoting, by every faculty they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;y&s;|tems of extended influence and wa&s;teful expenditure, to the creation of heavy and oppre&s;&s;ive public burdens, in numerous and unnece&s;&s;ary appointments to office, a &s;tanding army, a permanent navy, augmentation of public debt, loans at exce&s;&s;ive and exorbitant intere&s;t, and finally, additional and aggravated impo&s;t duties, ex|ci&s;es, &s;alt tax and land tax.</P>
<P>But, fellow-citizens, if in addition to this dark ca|talogue of public evils, you are told from he mouth of the now Pre&s;ident of the U. S. that "REPUBLI|CAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN ANY THING;" that "THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION IS, IN THE STRICTEST SENSE, A REPUBLIC;" that "AN
<PB N="5" REF="036917_0004_100B324C489BCBE0">HEREDITARY PRESIDENT AND SENATE FOR LIFE, CAN ALONE SECURE YOU HAPPINESS;" and that in the con|flict of political opinions which prevail in our country, "IT IS ADMISSIBLE FOR ONE FACTION TO SEIZE THE PERSONS OF THEIR OPPONENTS AND TRANSFER THEM WITHIN THE LINES OF AN INVADING ENEMY;" &mdash;<HI>When</HI> and <HI>where</HI> will you look for relief?</P>
<P>Heaven has wi&s;ely ordered, that on your own vir|tuous efforts alone, &s;hall it depend, to di&s;avow the prin|ciples, revoke the mea&s;ures, and di&s;card the men, that have thus afflicted you. Happy, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a citizen, to whom, under God, America is principally indebted for that &s;hare of political well-being &s;he now enjoys&mdash;JEFFERSON, mild, amiable, and philanthropic, refined in manners as enlightened in mind, the philo|&s;opher of the world, who&s;e name adds lu&s;tre to our national character, and as a legi&s;lator and &s;tate&s;man, &s;tands &s;econd to no man's&mdash;<HI>Jeffer&s;on, yet lives.</HI> On him then concentre your pre&s;ent views and your future hopes.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious by an active life, of great and con&s;i&s;tent efforts to promote the univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hment of re|publican liberty, and the permanent happine&s;s of the great family of mankind, he will neither di&s;ap|point your hopes nor defeat your wi&s;hes. Look into his pa&s;t life, examine all his conduct, and if you can di&s;cover one in&s;tance of political apo&s;tacy, or the di|relection of a republican principle, then withhold from him your confidence and your &s;uffrages.</P>
<P>Neither &s;uffer your&s;elves to be deceived by the calumnious efforts of electioneering partizans, the real enemies of America, to depreciate the moral and political character of the man who&s;e name &s;hould be dear to every republican heart. It is through the turpitude of tho&s;e enemies, that the pure virtues and pre-eminent talents of Jeffer&s;on &s;tand reflected, with undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre, and pre&s;ent him to the world as the friend and benefactor of the human race. See the te&s;timony of the venerable judge Pendleton, pre&s;ident of the Virginia convention, as recorded in the debates of that convention, pages 100 and 101, on the que&s;tion
<PB N="6" REF="036917_0005_100B324E782F9350">for adopting the foederal con&s;titution, who &s;peaks in the following emphatic words: <Q>I know and highly re&s;pect the great abilities of Mr. Jeffer&s;on&mdash;Providence has, for the happine&s;s of mankind, accompanied tho&s;e abilities with a di&s;po&s;ition to make u&s;e of them for the good of his fellow-beings.</Q> Honourable te&s;ti|monial of an aged and veteran &s;tate&s;man, who could contemplate with plea&s;ure the &s;upport and patronage he had yeilded to the youthful virtues and ri&s;ing talents of Jeffer&s;on, in early life&mdash;a te&s;timonial as honourable to him that gave, as to him that received it.</P>
<P>But re&s;ting on the &s;ame high and re&s;pected authority of judge Pendleton, &s;ee what he further &s;ays in the &s;ame debate, in reply to the artful in&s;inuation then made, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who was at that time ab&s;ent as mini&s;ter of the United States in France, had written &s;entiments ho&s;tile to the adoption of the foederal con&s;titution, and advi&s;ing its rejection.&mdash; <Q>I have &s;een, &s;ays Mr. Pendle|ton, the letter in which Mr. Jeffer&s;on has written his opinion upon this &s;ubject&mdash;It appears that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that con&s;titution, and has in his mind the idea of amending it&mdash;He has in his mind the very que&s;tion of &s;ub&s;equent or previous amendments, which is now under con&s;ideration. His &s;entiments on this &s;ubject are as follow: 'I wi&s;h with all my &s;oul that the fir&s;t nine conventions may accept the new con&s;titution, becau&s;e it will &s;ecure to us the good it contains, which I think great and important. I wi&s;h the four late&s;t, whichever they be, may refu&s;e to accede to it, 'till amendments are &s;ecured.'&mdash;He then enumerates the amendments which he wi&s;hes to be &s;ecured, and adds&mdash;'We mu&s;t take care however that neither this, nor any other objection to the form, produce a &s;chi&s;m in our union. That would be an incurable evil; becau&s;e friends falling out never cordially reunite.' Are the&s;e &s;entiments, (a&s;ks Mr. Pendleton) in favour of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to prevent its adoption by previous amendment? He wi&s;hes the fir&s;t nine &s;tates to adopt it&mdash;What are his rea&s;ons? Becau&s;e it will &s;ecure to us the good it contains, which he thinks great and important, and he wi&s;hes
<PB N="7" REF="036917_0006_100B324FF9F6F570">the other four may refu&s;e it, becau&s;e he thinks it will tend to obtain nece&s;&s;ary amendments&mdash;But he would not wi&s;h that a &s;chi&s;m &s;hould take place in the union <HI>on any con&s;ideration.</HI> If then we are to be influenced by his opinion at all, we will ratify it, and &s;ecure thereby the good it contains.</Q></P>
<P>Republican citizens of America, will you believe it, and &s;hall the groundle&s;s calumny yet find currency in our land, that Jeffer&s;on is an antifederali&s;t and enemy to the con&s;titution of the U. States? Reflect, and a&s;k your&s;elves, whether, if in the prophetic &s;pirit that dictated his remarks on the con&s;titution, as before quoted, the convention of four &s;tates had refu&s;ed to accede to it, until amendments were obtained, you would probably now have cau&s;e to regret the exi&s;tence in your country of an alien and &s;edition law, of the lately adopted doctrine of con&s;tructive trea&s;on, and above all, of the ruinous and di&s;graceful treaty with Great-Britain?</P>
<P>Equally repul&s;ive to the malign &s;ugge&s;tion that Mr. Jeffer&s;on is an enemy to religion, the public records of his native &s;tate, pre&s;ent to the world in the &s;tatute book of their laws, the celebrated act "for e&s;tabli&s;hing re|ligious freedom"&mdash;drawn by the pen, and offered to the a&s;&s;embly of Virginia, by the hand of their enlight|ened and illu&s;trious fellow-citizen: Read, ye fanatics, bigots, and religious hypocrites, of what&s;oever clime or country ye be&mdash;and you, ba&s;e calumniators, who&s;e efforts to traduce are the involuntary tribute of envy to a character more pure and perfect than your own, read, learn, and practi&s;e the RELIGION OF JEFFERSON, as di&s;played in the &s;ublime truths and in&s;pired language of HIS ever memorable "Act for e&s;tabli&s;hing religious freedom," thus:&mdash;</P>
<P>"WELL aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal puni&s;hments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocri&s;y and meanne&s;s, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet cho&s;e not to propagate it by coercions on
<PB N="8" REF="036917_0007_100B3251907D5FE0">either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious pre&s;umption of legi&s;lators and rulers, civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical, who, being them&s;elves but fallible and unin&s;pired men, have a&s;&s;umed dominion over the faith of others, &s;etting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as &s;uch endeavouring to impo&s;e them on others, hath e&s;tabli&s;hed and maintained fal&s;e religions over the greate&s;t part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furni&s;h contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he di&s;believes, is &s;inful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to &s;upport this or that teacher of his own religious per|&s;ua&s;ion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pa&s;tor, who&s;e morals he would make his pattern, and who&s;e powers he feels mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is with|drawing from the mini&s;try tho&s;e temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their per|&s;onal conduct, are an additional incitement to earne&s;t and unremitting labours for the in&s;truction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our reli|gious opinions, more than our opinions in phy&s;ics or geometry; that therefore the pro&s;cribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence, by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of tru&s;t and emolument, unle&s;s he profe&s;s or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriou&s;ly of tho&s;e privileges and advantages, to which, in common with his fellow-citizens, he has a natural right; that it tends al&s;o to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, tho&s;e who will externally profe&s;s and conform to it; that though indeed the&s;e are criminal who do not with&s;tand &s;uch temptation, yet neither are tho&s;e innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to &s;uffer the civil magi&s;trate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to re&s;train the profe&s;&s;ion or propagation of principles on &s;uppo&s;ition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once de&s;troys all religious liberty, becau&s;e he being of
<PB N="9" REF="036917_0008_100B32541B5A7CB8">cour&s;e judge of that tendency, will make his opinions. the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the &s;en|timents of others only as they &s;hall &s;quare with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purpo&s;es of civil government, for its officers to inter|fere when principles break out into overt acts again&s;t, peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great, and will prevail if left to her&s;elf: that &s;he is the proper and &s;ufficient antagoni&s;t to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unle&s;s by human interpo&s;ition di&s;armed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors cea&s;ing to be dangerous when it is per|mitted freely to contradict them:</P>
<P>"<HI>Be it therefore enacted by the General A&s;&s;embly</HI>&mdash;That no man &s;hall be compelled to frequent or &s;upport any reli|gious wor&s;hip, place, or mini&s;try what&s;oever, nor &s;hall be enforced, re&s;trained, mole&s;ted or burdened in his body or goods, nor &s;hall otherwi&s;e &s;uffer on account of his reli|gions opinions or belief; but that all men &s;hall be free to profe&s;s, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the &s;ame &s;hall in no wi&s;e dimini&s;h, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</P>
<P>"And though we well know that this a&s;&s;embly, elected by the people for the ordinary purpo&s;es of le|gi&s;lation only, have no power to re&s;train the acts of &s;uc|ceeding a&s;&s;emblies, con&s;tituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable, would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby a&s;&s;erted, are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act &s;hall be hereafter pa&s;&s;ed to repeal the pre&s;ent, or to narrow its operation, &s;uch act will be an infringe|ment of natural right."</P>
<P>Further, if the opponents of Mr. Jeffer&s;on require additional proof of the <HI>ardent piety</HI> and <HI>religious fervour</HI> of his mind, let them read in his "Notes on Virginia," page 237, his reflections on the &s;ubject of &s;lavery, expre&s;|&s;ive of his wi&s;hes for a <HI>gradual</HI> emancipation, which are concluded by the following pious apo&s;trophe. <Q>Can the liberties of a nation be thought &s;ecure when we have removed their only firm ba&s;is, a conviction in
<PB N="10" REF="036917_0009_100B325733674958">the minds of the people <HI>that the&s;e liberties are of the gift of God?</HI> That they are not to be violated but with <HI>his</HI> wrath? <HI>Indeed I tremble for my country</HI> when I reflect <HI>that God is ju&s;t: that his ju&s;tice cannot &s;leep forever:</HI> that con&s;idering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of &s;ituation is among po&s;&s;ible events: that it may become probable by &s;upernatural interference! <HI>The Almighty</HI> has no attribute which can take &s;ide with us in &s;uch a conte&s;t.&mdash;But it is impo&s;&s;ible to be temperate and to pur&s;ue this &s;ubject through the various con&s;iderations of policy, of mo|rals, of hi&s;tory, natural and civil. We mu&s;t be con|tented to hope they will force their way into every one's mind. I think a change already perceptible &s;ince the origin of the <HI>pre&s;ent [American]</HI> revolution. The &s;pirit of the ma&s;ter is abating, that of the &s;lave ri&s;ing from the du&s;t; his condition mollifying, <HI>the way I hope preparing, under the au&s;pices of heaven,</HI> for a total emancipation, and that this is di&s;po&s;ed <HI>in the order of events,</HI> to be with <HI>the con&s;ent of the ma&s;ters, rather</HI> than by their <HI>extirpation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Again, in the &s;ame Notes, page 240, evincing his anx|iety to cultivate a &s;pirit of genuine virtue in the public mind, as the &s;ure pre&s;ervative of republican liberty, he expre&s;&s;es a no le&s;s exalted &s;entiment of the cultivators of the &s;oil, the yeomanry of our country, than a ju&s;t confidence in the order of providence to perpetuate, through them, the &s;acred flame of moral and religious virtue.</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e, &s;ays Jeffer&s;on, who labour in the earth are the cho&s;en people of God; if ever he had a cho&s;en people, who&s;e brea&s;ts he has made his peculiar depo&s;it for &s;ub&s;tantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in which he keeps alive that &s;acred fire, which other|wi&s;e might e&s;cape from the face of the earth. Cor|ruption of morals in the ma&s;s of cultivators is a phe|nomenon of which no age nor nation has furni&s;hed an example. It is the mark &s;et on tho&s;e, who <HI>not looking up to heaven,</HI> to their own &s;oil and indu&s;try <HI>as does the hu&s;bandman,</HI> for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, depend
<PB N="11" REF="036917_0010_100B3258B48F2788">for it on the ca&s;ualties and caprice of cu&s;tomers. Dependance begets &s;ub&s;ervience and venality, &s;uf|focates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools for the de&s;igns of ambition.&mdash;It is the manners and &s;pirit of a people which pre&s;erve a republic in vigour. A degeneracy in the&s;e is a canker which &s;oon eats to the heart of its laws and con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>But is there not yet another accu&s;ation produced by the <HI>calumniators</HI> of this good man, which the recorded te&s;timonial of his country's approbation, al&s;o refutes? Namely, that while he was governor of Virginia, in the year 1781, during Arnold's inva&s;ion of that &s;tate, he &s;hamefully fled before a handful of light hor&s;e, and left the capital of the &s;tate, Richmond, to be pillaged and plundered by the enemy. If indeed it were true that Mr. Jeffer&s;on had been thus timid and faithle&s;s to his public tru&s;t. no man will believe that the Legi&s;lature of Virginia were ignorant of the circum&s;tances, or un|mindful of his conduct.&mdash;Accordingly it will be found in the proceedings of the Virginia Legi&s;lature of the 12th of December, 1781, that that a&s;&s;embly, having all the circum&s;tances of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's conduct before them and within their knowledge, re&s;pecting that inva|&s;ion, <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> re&s;olved, <Q>That the thanks of the General A&s;&s;embly be given to Thomas Jeffer&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for his <HI>attentive admini&s;tration</HI> of the powers of the Executive, whil&s;t in office.</Q></P>
<P>In addition, if the <HI>unanimous</HI> te&s;timony of the Legi&s;|lature be not, in the opinion of his calumniators, mo&s;t conclu&s;ive, it will be &s;een in the Gazette of the United States, publi&s;hed at Philadelphia, by John Fenno, that on the 26th of October, 1796, when the &s;ame ground|le&s;s calumny was brought forward in that gazette, again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;ed, a gentleman, who then gave his name to the printer, and who had been an officer in the army and an eye witne&s;s of all Mr. Jeffer&s;on's conduct during the in|va&s;ion of Virginia, in the year 1781, publi&s;hed in that gazette the following te&s;timonial of that conduct, which was never either an&s;wered or controverted; to wit,</P>

<PB N="12" REF="036917_0011_100B325AC2EC5E08">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. FENNO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;hameful mi&s;tatements of the writer in your Gazette under the &s;ignature of Phocion, re&s;|pecting the conduct of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, while governor of Virginia, in the year 1781, and having been per&s;onally pre&s;ent, in actual &s;ervice, through all the active &s;cenes of that year, from its commencement and before, until after the termination of the &s;iege of York, I can &s;tate what that conduct really was, with more truth and cer|tainty than either Phocion or his friend Charles Simms, neither of whom appear to know much about what they have written, and were, to my knowledge, neither of them in Virginia at the period referred to. Fir&s;t, then it is not true that "Mr. Jeffer&s;on <HI>abandoned his tru&s;t at the moment of inva&s;ion.</HI>"&mdash;Arnold's inva&s;ion took place in January, 1781: Mr. Jeffer&s;on remained in his &s;tation through the whole period of that inva&s;ion. Cornwallis's inva&s;ion took place in April, 1781, and he continued to advance into the country until the beginning of June, when he commenced his retreat before the mar|quis Fayette, into the lower country, on the &s;eaboard; the marquis having taken the command about two months before. Mr. Jeffer&s;on did not re&s;ign at all, or abandon his &s;tation; he remained in office until after Cornwallis's retreat, and until the time for which he was con&s;titutionally elected had expired; to wit, the 12th of June, 1781. Before he left this office, howe|ver, Mr. Jeffer&s;on demanded of the Legi&s;lature, a full enquiry into the conduct of the Executive for the la&s;t twelve months; which was accordingly granted by their re&s;olution of the 12th of June, 1781; and the 26th of November following appointed for the enquiry&mdash;being a period of near &s;ix months allowed to bring forward any charges or proofs again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on.&mdash;On the 26th of December, 1781, the A&s;&s;embly pro|ceeded to take up the enquiry at large, on the report of a committee of their own body; and having fir&s;t voted that no charge or accu&s;ation whatever appeared again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and that there never was any cau&s;e for the enquiry but &s;ome vague and groundle&s;s rumours, they pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;olution of the 12th De|cember,
<PB N="13" REF="036917_0012_100B325C6EFB2150">1781, already publi&s;hed in your paper (Mr. Fenno), and which if Phocion's candour will per|mit him again to read, he will find not merely an acknowledgment of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's ability and inte|grity, and <HI>altogether &s;ilent on the want of firmne&s;s,</HI> but containing an unanimous and expre&s;s vote of thanks for <HI>his attentive admini&s;tration of the powers of the Exe|cutive, whil&s;t in office.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Mr. Fenno, it is not true that Mr. Jeffer|&s;on at any time fled before a few light hor&s;emen, and &s;hamefully abandoned his tru&s;t, or, as &s;ugge&s;ted by Charles Simms, contributed by his conduct to the lo&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s which accrued to the &s;tate, in the de|&s;truction of public records and vouchers for general ex|penditure.&mdash;Let facts &s;peak: In four days from the ar|rival of Arnold's fleet, he proceeded 150 miles up James river, and landed his troops within 24 miles of Rich|mond, the night before his march to that place: all the militia of the &s;tate, which could be armed, being then out under the command of general Nel&s;on, in the neighbourhood of William&s;burg, and no defence at hand for the &s;ecurity of Richmond but about 200 half-armed militia, under the command of baron Steuben, who could do nothing more than cover the removal of the records and military &s;tores acro&s;s James river, from Richmond to Manche&s;ter, and &s;ecure the boats and batteaus on the Manche&s;ter &s;ide, to prevent the ene|my's pa&s;&s;ing. The writer of this remained in Rich|mond with the la&s;t detachment of militia that pa&s;&s;ed the river with records and &s;tores, and until the enemy, about 9 o'clock in the morning, had entered the lower part of the town and began to flank it with their light hor&s;e, he &s;aw Mr. Jeffer&s;on as active as man could be, as well the night before as that morning, i&s;&s;uing his or|ders and u&s;ing every exertion to remove the records and &s;tores. He afterwards &s;aw him at We&s;tham, five miles above Richmond, where Arnold pu&s;hed a detachment to de&s;troy the &s;tores at that place, and which, through Mr. Jeffer&s;on's exertions, were almo&s;t entirely &s;aved. The next day, when the enemy evacuated Richmond, the fir&s;t man the writer of this &s;aw, as he entered the
<PB N="14" REF="036917_0013_100B325EEA7E2C80">town, was Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Let a candid public then determine whether conduct like this, to which the writer hereof was an eye witne&s;s, manife&s;ted want of firmne&s;s or an abandonment of tru&s;t. The &s;ituation of the &s;tate was at that time peculiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; the whole quota of its continental troops were then acting in South-Carolina; many thou&s;and &s;tand of arms had been &s;upplied for the defence of North-Carolina, and Arnold's inva&s;ion found the &s;tate almo&s;t totally defence|le&s;s. The &s;tate of things was little better a few months afterwards, when Cornwallis's inva&s;ion happened, and the marquis Fayette took the command; &s;ince it is well known that through the whole of that campaign the marquis could never mu&s;ter more than three or four thou&s;and militia, badly armed, in aid of the few conti|nental troops that were detached from the northern army, to Virginia. Such was the deplorable &s;ituation both of the &s;tate and continent, for want of arms. In re&s;pect to Tarleton's &s;udden march to Charlotteville, during that campaign, in order to &s;urpri&s;e the gover|nor and a&s;&s;embly, it will be remembered, that the marquis's army was inferior to Cornwallis's, and had few or no cavalry attached to it; that at Charlotteville there was not even a &s;ingle company of militia, and that Tarlton made a rapid march, of about 60 miles through the country, at the head of about 500 cavalry. The writer of this was al&s;o pre&s;ent at Charlotteville at the time, and &s;aw Mr. Jeffer&s;on and his Executive Council attending their duty at that place, with the A&s;&s;embly: it will not be pretended then, under the circum&s;tances &s;tated, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on <Q><HI>fled before a few light hor&s;emen, and &s;hamefully abandoned his tru&s;t,</HI></Q> as <HI>&s;hamefully</HI> a&s;&s;erted by Phocion.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Fenno, why do the enemies of Mr. Jeffer|&s;on cavil <HI>alone</HI> at his honourable acquittal by the A&s;|&s;embly of Virginia, from groundle&s;s and unfounded charges? they well know that at the end of that very year, his brave and gallant &s;ucce&s;&s;or in office, general Nel&s;on, was &s;ubjected to public accu&s;ation and im|peachment before the A&s;&s;embly, for &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;con|duct in office, and honourably acquitted by the &s;ame
<PB N="15" REF="036917_0014_100B3260E3E1C698">body, in the &s;ame preci&s;e manner, and with an unani|mous vote of thanks, as in the ca&s;e of Mr. Jeffer&s;on. No proof appeared again&s;t either; the accu&s;ation in each was declared to be groundle&s;s, and the honour|able reputation of both &s;tand or fall by the verdict of the &s;ame body. I leave it with a candid public to form their own reflections.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>There yet remain two other calumnies again&s;t the much-abu&s;ed character of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, which require notice. They were both &s;ugge&s;ted in the year 1792, on the eve of a pre&s;idential election, and again in the year 1796, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, and are now revived; to wit,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t, That when mini&s;ter of the United States to France, in the year 1787, he made a di&s;honourable pro|po&s;ition to Congre&s;s, re&s;pecting a transfer of the debt due by the United States to France, to a Dutch com|pany.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly, That he was a debtor to Briti&s;h merchants before the revolutionary war, and pur&s;ued mea&s;ures to defraud his creditors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Unhappily for his calumniators, both the&s;e charges have been proved to be perfectly groundle&s;s, and to have originated only in the wickedne&s;s and malice of his enemies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge was publi&s;hed in the year 1792, in Fenno's Gazette, and given, as believed, from the trea&s;ury department of the United States, on who&s;e books Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the French debt, was recorded. The then head of that department was roundly accu&s;ed, in the public prints of that year, with mi&s;repre&s;entation and the breach of an official duty, in cau&s;ing or permitting to be publi&s;hed from the trea&s;ury books, for the purpo&s;e of aiding the calumny again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on, a mutilated copy of his letter to Congre&s;s, leaving out two entire paragraphs of it, and chang|ing the &s;en&s;e of the part publi&s;hed, by &s;ub&s;tituting words not in the original. This accu&s;ation was evaded, but never di&s;proved before the public, and it remains a &s;o|lemn
<PB N="16" REF="036917_0015_100B32626D445930">and incontrovertible truth, that the letter was publi&s;hed, &s;o mutilated.</P>
<P>The facts in relation to that letter are briefly the&s;e: Mr Jeffer&s;on informs congre&s;s, that an offer had been made by a &s;peculating Dutch company to the French court, to purcha&s;e the American debt due to that na|tion, at a di&s;count of &s;ix or eight million of livres; to which offer, when communicated by the French mini&s;|ter, to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, for his approbation, he replied that he had no power to approve or di&s;approve; to the agent of the Dutch company, who made the &s;ame appli|cation, he returned a &s;imilar an&s;wer; and in his letter to congre&s;s, pre&s;uming that the Dutch agent would make application to that body, he &s;tates the reflection, <Q>how far, if congre&s;s apprehend any future danger of the punctuality of payment, it might be advi&s;eable to transfer the di&s;contents ari&s;ing from that &s;ource, from the French court, who&s;e friend&s;hip we ought to cultivate, to the brea&s;ts of a <HI>private company</HI> of <HI>adventuring &s;peculators,</HI> who fore&s;eeing the po&s;&s;ible delays of payment, had calculated the probable lo&s;s, and were willing to encounter the hazard.</Q></P>
<P>Two other paragraphs follow; to wit, "That in his (Mr. Jeffer&s;on's) opinion, however, the honour and cre|dit <Q>of the United States may be pre&s;erved inviolate: that the French debt may be di&s;charged <HI>without di&s;|count</HI> or <HI>lo&s;s</HI> to that nation, and the &s;tipulations of the United States be complied with, to all its cre|ditors.</Q> And he then &s;ugge&s;ts to congre&s;s the mode of doing it.</P>
<P>The enemies of Mr. Jeffer&s;on publi&s;hed this letter, leaving out the two la&s;t paragraphs, and changing the &s;en&s;e of the fir&s;t in the manner that has been &s;tated.</P>
<P>On the whole letter a &s;ingle reflection is &s;ubmitted, Whether in any in&s;tance of public conduct Mr. Jeffer&s;on could have more ju&s;tly appreciated the duty of a public mini&s;ter, or more happily combined it with the con&s;ci|entious and moral &s;en&s;e of public and private integrity?</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge, "That Mr. Jeffer&s;on was a debtor to Briti&s;h merchants, before the revolutionary war, and pur&s;ued mea&s;ures to defraud his creditors," is refuted
<PB N="17" REF="036917_0016_100B3265143F9418">and di&s;proved, in a manner highly honourable to Mr. Jeffer&s;on's reputation, by a publication of the 5th of April la&s;t, made in Philadelphia, by a gentleman who took particular pains to inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject; and is as followeth:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF MR. JEFFERSON'S <HI>BRITISH DEBTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is the fate of every man who&s;e virtue and talents have elevated him in &s;ociety, to excite the envy and hatred of many; among per&s;ons thus di&s;po&s;ed, &s;ome are imperceptibly carried into error, others are de&s;ign|edly criminal.&mdash;The &s;teady indu&s;try di&s;played by the a&s;&s;ailants of virtue exceeds infinitely that of its de|fenders; and unfortunately, the meditated injury has its full effect before the per&s;on accu&s;ed is aware of it, and in&s;tead of parrying the blow he has the wound to heal. In this &s;ituation of things, &s;o rare is benevolence to be found among&s;t us, &s;o little intere&s;t do we generally take in the welfare of our fellow-men, that we are apt to imagine we have di&s;charged our duty when we de|clare our belief of the innocence of the accu&s;ed, and content our&s;elves under the &s;elf-approbation, that we have done nothing to injure the feelings of the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>The evils to &s;ociety which we permit to remain, without our utmo&s;t exertions to remove, may an&s;wer well enough with people who are <HI>negatively good,</HI> or who believe that virtue con&s;i&s;ts in ab&s;taining from evil: I think differently: and thinking as I do, will never permit the people to be duped by fal&s;e accu&s;ations le|velled again&s;t their mo&s;t meritorious and de&s;erving &s;er|vants. If in the charges, which, from my be&s;t judg|ment, I am obliged to make again&s;t public characters, I pa&s;s into error, the principle which governs me, ought al&s;o to draw forth an advocate for truth and virtue, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time pa&s;t, a great clamour has been made through the United States, re&s;pecting debts due from Mr. Jeffer&s;on, to Briti&s;h merchants: I have taken &s;ome trouble to inform my&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, and I confe&s;s, that although I did not believe the charge to be correct, as to the idea which it was intended to convey of that
<PB N="18" REF="036917_0017_100B32678FFFB400">gentleman's honour; I had no conception, that his enemies would be driven to attack him upon a &s;ubject, which, if fairly examined, would add &s;o con&s;iderably to the lu&s;tre of his character.</P>
<P>In the year 1774, before a &s;hilling of paper money had been i&s;&s;ued, Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;old about five thou&s;and acres of land in Cumberland and Bedford counties, to pay his proportion of a debt due from the e&s;tate of Mr. Wayles to Farrel and Jones. He of|fered the bonds to their agent immediately, who refu&s;ed to take them. The money was paid to Mr. Jeffer&s;on in 1779 and 1780, and he carried it to the trea&s;ury of Virginia, as the laws pre&s;&s;ed on all to do, who owed money to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; declaring that the public would pay it over, dollar for dollar. This delu&s;ion &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed away, and it became evident, that the public neither could nor ought to pay according to the nominal value. The reader will perceive the lo&s;s which Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;u&s;tained, and that if he had been di&s;po&s;ed to quibble, no event could have af|forded him a more plau&s;ible pretext: But it appears that this gen|tleman con&s;idered him&s;elf &s;till an&s;werable to Farrel and Jones, and therefore &s;ettled with their agent otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The next debt in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was one due to Kippen and com|pany, for whom Mr. Lyle, of Manche&s;ter, was agent. I called upon that gentleman for information re&s;pecting Mr. Jeffer&s;on's conduct in the &s;ettlement of this claim, who a&s;&s;ured me that it was &s;trictly honourable. Mr. Lyle told me that as &s;oon as the Vice Pre&s;ident returned from his mi&s;&s;ion to France, he waited upon him, and made immediate arrangements for payment, de|ducting the 8 years war intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Concerning the war intere&s;t, I think the annexed letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on, will be quite &s;atisfactory. But exclu&s;ive of his particular &s;ituation, and the lo&s;&s;es which he &s;u&s;tained, probably from his con&s;picuous &s;ervices during the revolutionary conte&s;t; I know of not a &s;olitary in&s;tance in which the eight years intere&s;t has been paid, if objected to by the defendant's coun&s;el; and I fancy it was the opinion of the federal judges a&s;&s;embled in Phila|delphia, that the war intere&s;t ought to be deducted, if a &s;pecial rea&s;on for avoiding it could be a&s;&s;igned&mdash;and &s;urely no rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned with more forcible propriety, than that the Bri|ti&s;h them&s;elves had de&s;troyed the means. But, to my mind, there is the be&s;t evidence of the equity of withholding the eight years intere&s;t; the juries have uniformly deducted it, although the coun&s;el for the plaintiff has often a&s;&s;igned peculiar and &s;trong rea|&s;ons, &s;pringing from the manner in which the debt originated, why it &s;hould be allowed.</P>
<P>The following letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on, while in Paris, is now &s;ubmitted to the public. It was not procured from him, but having been produced in court by Jones's agent, in another
<PB N="19" REF="036917_0018_100B32698C391EB0">ca&s;e, was by the coun&s;el of that agent candidly and honourably read in court as an act of ju&s;tice to Mr. Jeffer&s;on; get thus into the pre&s;s, and has &s;ince been u&s;ed by the advocates for the pay|ment of Briti&s;h debts, and by them, very much complimented.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We add, from unque&s;tionable authority, that &s;oon after Mr. Jeffer&s;on's return from France, arrangements were made with the agent of Farrel and Jones, and a depo&s;it placed in his hands, to the amount of the claim again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on.</NOTE></P>

<SALUTE>Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you in London, I mentioned to you that the affairs of Mr. Wayles's e&s;tate, were left to be ul|timately &s;ettled by Mr. Eppes, the only acting executor; that I have left in his hands al&s;o, and in tho&s;e of a Mr. Lewis, the part of Mr. Wayles's e&s;tate which came to me, together with my own: that they were fir&s;t to clear off &s;ome debts which had been nece&s;|&s;arily contracted during the war, and would after that apply the whole profits to the payment of my part of Mr. Wayles's debt to you, and to a debt of mine to Kippen and company of Gla&s;gow.&mdash;Being anxious to begin the payment of the&s;e two debts, and finding that it would be too long po&s;tponed if the re&s;iduary ones were to be paid merely from the annual profits of the e&s;tate; a number of &s;laves have been &s;old, and I have lately received infor|mation from Me&s;&s;rs. Eppes and Lewis, that the proceeds of that &s;ale, with the profits of the e&s;tate to the end of 1781. would pay off the whole of the re&s;iduary debts.&mdash;As we are now, therefore, clear of embarra&s;&s;ment to pur&s;ue our principal object; I am de|&s;irous of arranging with you, &s;uch ju&s;t and practicable conditions, as will a&s;certain to you, the terms at which you will receive my part of your debt, and give me the &s;atisfaction of knowing that you are contented.&mdash;What the laws of Virginia are, or may be, will in no wi&s;e influence my conduct.&mdash;Sub&s;tantial ju&s;tice is my object, as decided by rea&s;on, and not by authority or compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion which ari&s;es, is, as to the article of intere&s;t. For all the time preceding the war and all &s;ub&s;equent to it, I think it rea&s;onable that intere&s;t &s;hould be paid; but equally un|rea&s;onable during the war. Intere&s;t is a compen&s;ation for the u&s;e of money.&mdash;Your money in my hands, is in the form of lands and negroes. From the&s;e during the war, no u&s;e, no profits, could be derived. Tobacco is the article they produce; that only can be turned into money at a foreign market. But the moment it went out of our ports for that purpo&s;e, it was captured either by the king's &s;hips, or by tho&s;e of individuals. The con&s;equence was, that tobacco worth from twenty to thirty &s;hillings the hundred,
<PB N="20" REF="036917_0019_100B326B2F7385A0">&s;old generally in Virginia, during the war, for five &s;hillings&mdash;this price it is known will not maintain the labourer and pay his taxes. There was no &s;urplus of profit then to pay an intere&s;t. In the mean while we &s;tood in&s;urers of the lives of the labourers, and of the ultimate i&s;&s;ue of the war. He who attempted during the war to remit either his principal or intere&s;t, mu&s;t have expected to remit three times, to make one payment; becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that two out of three parts of the &s;hipments were taken. It was not po&s;&s;ible then for the debtor, to derive any profit from the mo|ney which might enable him to pay an intere&s;t, nor yet to get rid of the principal by remitting it to his creditor. With re&s;pect to creditors in Great Britain, they turned their attention to priva|teering, and arming the ve&s;&s;els they had before employed in trad|ing with us; they captured on the &s;eas, not only the produce of the farms of their debtors, but of tho&s;e of the whole &s;tate. They thus paid them&s;elves by capture more than their annual intere&s;t; and we lo&s;t more. Some merchants indeed did not engage in privateering; the&s;e lo&s;t their intere&s;t, but <HI>we</HI> did not gain it; it fell into the hands of their countrymen. It cannot therefore be demanded of us. As between the&s;e merchants and their debtors, it is the ca&s;e where, a lo&s;s being incurred, each party may ju&s;tifi|cably endeavour to &s;hift it from him&s;elf; each has an equal right to avoid it; one party can never expect the other to yield a thing, to which he has as good a right as the demander: we even think, he has a better right than the demander in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. This lo&s;s has been occa&s;ioned by the fault of the nation which was creditor. Our right to avoid it then &s;tands on le&s;s excep|tionable ground than theirs. But it will be &s;aid, that each party thought the other the aggre&s;&s;or&mdash;in the&s;e di&s;putes, there is but one umpire, and that has decided the que&s;tion, where the world in general thought the right lay.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons in favour of the general ma&s;s of debtors, I have &s;ome peculiar to my own ca&s;e. In the year 1776, before a &s;hilling of paper money was i&s;&s;ued I &s;old lands to the amount of &pound;. 4,200, in order to pay the&s;e two debts. I offered the bonds of the purcha&s;ers to your agent, Mr. Evans, if he would acquit me, and accept of the purcha&s;ers as debtors, in my place. They were as &s;ure as my&s;elf; had he done it, the&s;e debts being turned over to you, would have been &s;aved to you by the treaty of peace. But he declined it. Great &s;ums of paper money were afterwards i&s;&s;ued; this depreciated, and payment was made me in this money, when it was but a &s;hadow. Our laws do not entitle their own fellow citizens to require re-payment in the&s;e ca&s;es, though the treaty authori&s;es the Briti&s;h creditor to do it. Here then I lo&s;t the principal and intere&s;t once.&mdash;Again, Lord Cornwallis en|camped ten days on an e&s;tate of mine at Elk I&s;land, having his
<PB N="21" REF="036917_0020_100B326DC2695328">head-quarters in my hou&s;e. He burned all the tobacco hou&s;es and barns on the farm, with the produce of the former year in them; he burnt all the enclo&s;ures, and wa&s;ted the fields in which the crop of that year was growing (it was in the month of June): he killed or carried off every living animal, cutting the throats of tho&s;e which were too young for &s;ervice. Of the &s;laves, he car|ried away thirty. The u&s;ele&s;s and barbarous injury he did me in that in&s;tance, was more than would have paid your debt, principal and intere&s;t: Thus I lo&s;t it a &s;econd time. Still I will lay my &s;houlders a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the payment of it a third time; in doing this, however, I think your&s;elf will be of opinion, I am authori&s;ed, in ju&s;tice, to clear it of every article not demandable in &s;trict right: of this nature I con&s;ider intere&s;t during the war.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion is, as to the paper money I depo&s;ited in the trea&s;ury of Virginia, towards the di&s;charge of this debt. I before ob&s;erved, that I had &s;old lands to the amount of &pound;. 4,200 before a &s;hilling of paper money was emitted, with a view to pay this debt. I received this money in depreciated paper. The &s;tate was then calling on tho&s;e who owed money to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to bring it into the trea&s;ury, engaging to pay a like &s;um to the cre|ditor at the end of the war. I carried the identical money there|fore to the trea&s;ury, where it was applied, as all the money of the &s;ame de&s;cription was, to the &s;upport of the war. Sub&s;equent events have been &s;uch, that the &s;tate cannot, and ought not to pay the &s;ame nominal &s;um in gold or &s;ilver, which they received in paper: nor is it certain what they will do. My intention be|ing, and having always been, that whatever the &s;tate decides, you &s;hall receive my part of your debt fully. I am ready to remove all difficulty ari&s;ing from this depo&s;it, to take back to my&s;elf the demand again&s;t the &s;tate, and to con&s;ider the depo&s;it as originally made for my&s;elf, and not for you.</P>
<P>The&s;e two articles of intere&s;t and paper money, being thus &s;et|tled, I would propo&s;e to divide the clear proceeds of the e&s;tate (in which there are from eighty to one hundred labouring &s;laves) between your&s;elf and Kippen and Co. two-thirds to you, and one-third to them; and that the crop of this pre&s;ent year, 1787, &s;hall con&s;titute the fir&s;t payment. That crop, you know, cannot be got to the warehou&s;e completely till May, of the next year; and I &s;uppo&s;e that three months more will be little enough to &s;end it to Europe, or to &s;ell it in Virginia, and remit the money&mdash;&s;o that I could not &s;afely an&s;wer for placing the proceeds in your hands, till the month of Augu&s;t; and annually every Augu&s;t af|terwards, till the debt &s;hall be paid. It will always be my intere&s;t, and my wi&s;h, to get it to you as much &s;ooner as po&s;&s;ible, and pro|bably a part of it may always be paid &s;ome months &s;ooner. If the a&s;&s;igning the profits, in general terms, may &s;eem to you too vague,
<PB N="22" REF="036917_0021_100B327102695328">I am willing to &s;ix the annual payment at a certain &s;um. But that I may not fall &s;hort of my engagement, I &s;hall name it &s;ome|what le&s;s than I &s;uppo&s;e may be counted on. I &s;hall &s;ix your part at four hundred pounds &s;terling annually; and as you know our crops of tobacco to be uncertain, I &s;hould re&s;erve a right, if they fell &s;hort one year, to make it up the en&s;uing one, without being &s;uppo&s;ed to have failed in my engagements&mdash;but every other year, at lea&s;t, all arrearages &s;hall be fully paid up.</P>
<P>My part of this debt of Mr. Wayles's e&s;tate being one-third.

It will be ob&s;erved, that the preceding letter is dated at Paris, in 1787: Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, awaited Mr. Jef|fer&s;on's return to America, and authori&s;ed his agent to &s;ettle with him there. Immediately after his arrival in Virginia, in the fall of 1789, he procured a meeting with the agent and the gentlemen intere&s;ted, and an amicable &s;ettlement was made in writing, on the principles of the letter.&mdash;Mr. Jeffer&s;on immediatdly &s;old property again to the <HI>whole amount of the debt,</HI> and in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t and &s;econd years delivered over the obligations received for it to the agent, who took on him&s;elf the collection of the mo|ney; &s;o that now it is &s;even or eight years &s;ince he has paid up this debt. From the foregoing facts it appears that Mr. Jeffer&s;on, before the pre&s;ent government exi&s;ted, before he could have known that it was thought of, and at a time when there was no power to compel him to payment on account of Mr. Wayles's debts to Briti&s;h merchants, made a <HI>voluntary</HI> offer of &s;ettlement, on the mo&s;t favourable terms which they have obtained under the judicial &s;y&s;tem of the United States. The claim under the pay|ment into the trea&s;ury of Virginia, was &s;o well founded, that it received the &s;anction of a circuit court there, although that deci|&s;ion was afterwards rever&s;ed by the &s;upreme court.&mdash;Every body who attended on the court, will recollect the impre&s;&s;ive argument of Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> (now in Congre&s;s), in &s;upport of the deci&s;ion of the circuit court, and it will ever remain a doubt whether it ought not to have been affirmed. It is highly honourable to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, to have waved a legal defence, which was complete at the time (as the courts of Virginia were &s;overeign), &s;o &s;pecious in its general me|rits, and, as it re&s;pected him&s;elf, rendered perfectly ju&s;t, by the &s;acrifice of as much property as was &s;ufficient to pay the debt. It is enough to &s;ay, that no Briti&s;h creditor, even where payment could not be alleged, has ever obtained more from the federal courts than Mr. Jeffer&s;on voluntarily paid.&mdash;There was another claim made by the agent of the &s;ame hou&s;e, of <HI>Farrell &amp; Jones,</HI> again&s;t the executors of Mr. Wayles and another, for a cargo of about <ABBR>&pound;.</ABBR> 4,000 value, to be &s;old on commi&s;&s;ion, on account of the con&s;ignees: Mr. Wayles a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ale, but died &s;oon after; and the whole collection &s;urvived to the other con&s;ignee; who re|ceived it, wa&s;ted it, and died a bankrupt: the agent thought he would try the chance of recovering the money from the executors of Mr. Wayles, though they had not received it: but on the hear|ing, eleven of the jury determined at once again&s;t their liability, but the twelfth di&s;&s;enting, the ca&s;e was laid over to the next fe|deral court; when a &s;econd jury concurred unanimou&s;ly with the eleven of the fir&s;t, gave a verdict for the executors, and agreea|bly to the opinions of judge <HI>Iredell,</HI> who had pre&s;ided at one hear|ing, and of judge <HI>Patter&s;on,</HI> at the other. General <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="036917_0023_100B32740DA2CC88">judge <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> then of the bar, were the council for the executors. Palpably unfounded as this claim was, the trumpet of calumny, &s;welled it, when it &s;uited a particular purpo&s;e, from one-third of <ABBR>&pound;.</ABBR> 4,000 to <ABBR>&pound;.</ABBR> 40,000; and from a groundle&s;s claim, to an unque&s;|tionable debt, which was to &s;wallow up Mr. Jeffer&s;on's fortune!</P>
<P>HAVING NOW, fellow citizens, reviewed in their or|der, the whole of the combined calumnies which the po|litical enemies of Mr. Jeffer&s;on have produced again&s;t him, and expo&s;ed their fal&s;ehood and malice, it would be doing equal inju&s;tice to you, and to the honourable reputation of this di&s;tingui&s;hed native citizen of Ame|rica, not to pre&s;ent to your view, an Epitome of his public life and &s;ervices, and thereby po&s;&s;e&s;s you with a fuller knowledge of the laborious efforts and eminent u&s;efulne&s;s, by which he has &s;o greatly contributed to pro|mote the be&s;t good of our common country and the gene|ral happine&s;s of man: It will moreover afford the mo&s;t effectual antidote to all the poi&s;onous effu&s;ions of &s;lander, and enable you to judge for your&s;elves, uninfluenced by party con&s;iderations, whether a life hitherto &s;o zea|lou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully devoted to the pur&s;uit and ac|compli&s;hment of &s;o many great and good principles for the common benefit of mankind, &s;hall by your &s;uffrages to him, be rendered more eminently u&s;eful to America, in the all important office and character of <HI>Chief Magi&s;|trate</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ident of the United States.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="biography">
<HEAD>THOMAS JEFFERSON</HEAD>
<P>Was born in the year 1743, in the County of Albe|marle in Virginia, where he now re&s;ides. His father was a reputable landholder of that County, and gave <HI>this,</HI> his elde&s;t &s;on, a college education at the univer&s;ity of William and Mary, in the city of William&s;burg. After pa&s;&s;ing his degrees, being de&s;igned for the bar, Mr. Jeffer&s;on commenced a &s;tudent at law, under the
<PB N="25" REF="036917_0024_100B327651CD5F80">guidance of George Wythe, now the venerable judge and &s;ole chancellor of Virginia.</P>
<P>In 1766, Mr. Jeffer&s;on came to the bar of the &s;upreme court of his native &s;tate, and continued to practi&s;e therein with great &s;ucce&s;s and reputation, until the commencement of the American revolution in 1775, and the con&s;equent occlu&s;ion of the courts of ju&s;tice: during this period of active practice, the indu&s;trious mind of Jeffer&s;on found time to dige&s;t the fir&s;t volume of Reports of Adjudged Ca&s;es in the Supreme Courts of Virginia, which were ever exhibited in that &s;tate, and, to this day, are admitted authority in tho&s;e courts, remain|ing a monument of his early labours and u&s;eful talents.</P>
<P>In 1774, when all America were rou&s;ed into ac|tion by the aggravated wrongs of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;tepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and publi&s;hed his much admired pamphlet, "A Summary View of the Rights of Briti&s;h America," <HI>addre&s;&s;ed to the King,</HI> which brought forward again&s;t the author, threats of pro&s;ecution for trea&s;on, by lord Dunmore, then governor of Virginia; threats which produced no other effect on the indepen|dent mind of Jeffer&s;on, than publicly to avow him&s;elf the author, prepared to meet all con&s;equences.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Jeffer&s;on married the daughter of Mr. Wayles an eminent coun&s;ellor at law, and con|tinued to enjoy uninterrupted dome&s;tic felicity in the &s;ociety of one of the mo&s;t amiable of women, until the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues, and the guardian of their two daughters and &s;urviving i&s;&s;ue, to who&s;e education and &s;ettlement in life, and the &s;ervice of his country, he has ever &s;ince faithfully devoted him&s;elf, &s;till remaining a widower.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was elected a member of the Virginia Convention, and on the 4th of Augu&s;t, in the &s;ame year, one of the members to repre&s;ent the &s;tate, then colony, of Virginia, in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In that memorable year 1776, the natal year of Ame|rican emancipation from Briti&s;h tyranny, and of the independence and &s;overeignty of the United States, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was one of a committee of five, to wit, Thomas Jeffer&s;on, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
<PB N="26" REF="036917_0025_100B32787440D8A8">Roger Sherman and R. R. Living&s;ton; appointed by Congre&s;s to draught the Declaration of Independence, and it was from the pen and enlightened mind of Jeffer&s;on, fir&s;t named of the committee, that that glo|rious in&s;trument proceeded, which was reported by the committee, and unanimou&s;ly adopted by Congre&s;s, en|titled, <HI>"The Declaration of Independence, &amp;c."</HI> An in&s;trument which, &s;o long as the records of time &s;hall endure, will perpetuate the fame of its author, and pre&s;erve, in the American mind, <HI>forever</HI> and <HI>in&s;eparable,</HI> the names of <HI>Independence</HI> and <HI>Jeffer&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1776, the ardent mind of Jeffer&s;on, eagerly pur&s;uing the glorious principles of the revolu|tion, and fore&s;eeing that &s;o long as the corruptions of Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tems exi&s;ted, we were independent in name not in fact, produced for the adoption of the legi&s;lature of his native &s;tate, the four following important acts, to wit;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. An act for e&s;tabli&s;hing religious freedom, pub|li&s;hed in this e&s;&s;ay.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An act to regulate de&s;cents, to prevent e&s;tates en|tail and the rights of primogeniture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An act for the apportionment of crimes and pu|ni&s;hments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. An act to e&s;tabli&s;h public &s;chools.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The influence of the&s;e acts upon the relative princi|ples they embrace will be univer&s;ally &s;een and felt by tho&s;e who prize civil liberty as a primary ble&s;&s;ing, and regard the pre&s;ervation of it as among the fir&s;t behe&s;ts of God to man&mdash;whil&s;t &s;y&s;tems of univer&s;al toleration in matters of religion; for an equal di&s;tribution of pro|perty, and in &s;ubver&s;ion of the ari&s;tocratic and unnatural principle of entail and primogeniture right; for ame|liorating the &s;anguinary code of criminal law; and for extending to the poore&s;t cla&s;s of our citizens, the bene|fits of education at public expen&s;e, will be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealou&s;ly endea|vouring to promote the happine&s;s and improve the con|dition of his fellow beings.</P>
<P>Equally evincive of watchful regard to the rights of his countrymen, was the &s;cheme and &s;ugge&s;tion made by Mr. Jeffer&s;on for the formation and adoption of the Con&s;titu|tion of Virginia, in the &s;ame year, for prefixing thereto
<PB N="27" REF="036917_0026_100B327ADB5A3280">A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalien|able rights of man," which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being then a member of the Virginia Legi&s;lature, pre&s;ented to that body the act "to prevent the importation of &s;laves," which was enacted into a law in the month of October in the &s;ame year, and was &s;hortly after followed by another act "to authori&s;e manumi&s;&s;ions," being the commencement of a &s;y&s;tem of gradual emancipation, al&s;o propo&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>In the year 1779, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, at the age of 36, was cho&s;en governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781&mdash;during which the &s;tate ex|perienced three inva&s;ions, and was al&s;o brought into a critical &s;tate of colli&s;ion re&s;pecting its boundary lines with two neighbouring &s;tates, North-Carolina and Penn|&s;ylvania. His conduct in that &s;tation amid&s;t the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of foreign inva&s;ion and do|me&s;tic di&s;quietude, was &s;uch, as &s;ecured to him, 6 months after he left the office, and upon the fulle&s;t public enqui|ry, the <HI>unanimous</HI> vote of thanks of the Legi&s;lature, con&s;i&s;ting of 180 members, "for his attentive admini&s;|tration of the powers of the executive whil&s;t in office."</P>
<P>It was during the &s;ame year, 1781, amid&s;t the cares of government and &s;cenes of private affliction, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on prepared his celebrated work, afterwards pub|li&s;hed in France, and which he mode&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>"Notes on Virginia."</HI> In this work, &s;o ju&s;tly admired by all the learned world, for its philo&s;ophical re&s;earch, in|genious theory, and able di&s;qui&s;ition, equally evidenc|ing an enlarged, liberal and pious mind, the author, in a &s;uperior &s;tyle of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of Mr. Buffon and the Abbe Kaynal, which tend to di&s;parage the animal and its &s;pecies, both man and bea&s;t, of the American world, and reduce them to a &s;cale &s;maller than tho&s;e of Eu|rope; vindicating with truth and intelligence the equal di&s;tribution of nature's ble&s;&s;ings to America.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was again appointed to a &s;eat in Congre&s;s from his native &s;tate, and in the follow|ing year, on the 7th of May, was nominated by that honourable body mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of the United States to the Court of France, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of our illu&s;trious Franklin, whither he embarked early in the
<PB N="28" REF="036917_0027_100B327CEEDAEF20">&s;ame year, and remained ab&s;ent from the United States, in the execution of the duties of that important tru&s;t, until the month of October, 1789, when he returned home by permi&s;&s;ion of the then pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, who, upon being elected to the chief magi&s;tracy of the foederal government, immediately de&s;tined Mr. Jeffer&s;on to fill the next mo&s;t honourable and confidential &s;tation in the executive government, near his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>During his mi&s;&s;ion to France, Mr. Jeffer&s;on with that peculiar addre&s;s, intelligence and attention to promote the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the United States, which directs all his conduct, obtained from the French king, an ar|rette, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admi&s;&s;ion, exempt from the cu&s;tomary foreign duties, of oil, fi&s;h and whalebone, the product of the Ame|rican fi&s;heries, into certain ports, and for the &s;ale of Ame|rican built &s;hips in all the ports of France&mdash;benefits, which our Ea&s;tern brethren continued to reap the pecu|liar advantage of, until the commencement of the revo|lutionary convul&s;ions which have agitated that nation.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame period al&s;o, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in con|junction with our immortal Franklin, negociated with a mini&s;ter from the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, then at the Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of <HI>"The Pru&s;&s;ian treaty,"</HI> in which an a&s;toni&s;hed world has, for the fir&s;t time, &s;een a public avowal and po&s;itive provi&s;ion by treaty, between two &s;overeign and inde|pendent nations, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e two great and glorious principles, promotive of univer&s;al peace and happine&s;s, to wit, 1&s;t. <HI>"That free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods:"</HI> and 2d. <HI>"That privateering in time of war be aboli&s;hed;"</HI> principles which it were to be wi&s;hed could be rendered univer&s;al and eternal. Mr. Adams, now pre&s;ident of the United States, was one of the com|mi&s;&s;ion for negociating this treaty, and on its comple|tion, it was &s;ent over to London, where Mr. Adams then re&s;ided as mini&s;ter of the United States, for his &s;igna|ture. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to him&s;elf a &s;hare of the glory which reflects on the authors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, &s;ince he be|came pre&s;ident of the United States, we have &s;een
<PB N="29" REF="036917_0028_100B327E8AA66508">him nominate his &s;on John Quincy Adams, as mini&s;ter to the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, as de|clared, of renewing the treaty with that nation, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly another treaty has been made by his &s;on with Pru&s;&s;ia, which has been ap|proved by a majority of the Senate and ratified by the pre&s;ident, but which, in&s;tead of renewing and continu|ing the old treaty, is in it&s;elf a new one, expre&s;sly abandoning and renouncing the two ine&s;timable prin|ciples, 1&s;t. <HI>"That free &s;hips make free goods;"</HI> and 2d. <HI>"That privateering in time of war be aboli&s;hed;"</HI> prin|ciples which, it appears, from the corre&s;pondence ac|companying the negociation, laid before the &s;enate of the United States by the pre&s;ident, the wi&s;e and en|lightened mini&s;ters of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, were brought, with great difficulty and reluctance, to aban|don, on the earne&s;t &s;olicitation and reiterated demand of the American negociator, under the &s;ugge&s;tion that the maritime powers, <HI>particularly Great-Britain,</HI> would never &s;anction or permit them.</P>
<P>In the year 1789, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being returned to the United States, and appointed by pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, &s;ecretary to the department of &s;tate, immediately en|tered on the arduous duties of that important &s;tation, having previou&s;ly &s;tipulated with the pre&s;ident, that in con&s;ideration of the many years ab&s;ence from his family and e&s;tate, he might be permitted, at the expiration of the con&s;titutional term for which the pre&s;ident was elected, to retire from the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;ult of the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on in the department of &s;tate, were exhibited to Congre&s;s in the following reports, to wit;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. A report, on the the fi&s;heries of the United States.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. A report, on coins, weights and mea&s;ures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. A report, on the wa&s;te and unappropriated lands of the United States.</ITEM>

<P>Each of the&s;e reports di&s;played the u&s;ual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</P>
<P>But it was re&s;erved for a more critical and delicate
<PB N="30" REF="036917_0029_100B32819CA8F1D0">period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre|eminent talents of the American &s;ecretary &s;hould be|come mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and intere&s;tingly u&s;eful to his country: The non-execution of the treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great-Britain, her detention of our We&s;tern po&s;ts, and the attendant &s;po|liations on our commerce, both by Great-Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the in|trigues of the mini&s;ter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a &s;ituation difficult and perplexing. Be&s;ides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to all We&s;tern America. In this &s;tate of things, the ju&s;t confidence, which, the di&s;criminating mind of Wa&s;hington, had repo&s;ed in Mr. Jeffer&s;on, was amply repaid, by that promptne&s;s, zeal and ability, with which the American &s;ecretary, contri|buted by his labours, to relieve the executive from em|barra&s;&s;ment. Through a &s;eries of ma&s;terly and une|qualled diplomatique corre&s;pondence, which he main|tained, at the &s;ame time, with the re&s;pective mini&s;ters of Great-Britain and France, namely Hammond and Genet, he traver&s;ed and rebutted their re&s;pective cau&s;es of charge and complaint again&s;t the United States, and having fully proved the various aggre&s;&s;ions and infrac|tions of treaty on the part of their re&s;pective govern|ments, pointed to the means for pre&s;erving the honour and maintaining the rights of his own country, whil&s;t alike &s;uperior to the intrigues of Great-Britain or of France, he fully manife&s;ted that he held no particular attachment to any foreign nation, but was equally pre|pared, with the deci&s;ion, firmne&s;s and intelligence of a true American, to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of all. The recal of Genet, and appointment of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings between the United States and France, the appointment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great-Britain and the recal of Mr. Ham|mond, appointment of Mr. Li&s;ton, and &s;ub&s;equent pro|ceedings with Great-Britain, are all well known. In re&s;pect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, were more immediately effective and complete. Having po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States then at Madrid, negociating a treaty with the court of Spain,
<PB N="31" REF="036917_0030_100B32839EDB8D28">with the mo&s;t ample and pointed in&s;tructions, and al&s;o of the form and provi&s;ions of a treaty, predicated on the ba&s;is of the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, it re|mained only for Mr. Thomas Pinckney, then mini&s;ter from the United States at London, under &s;pecial in&s;truc|tion from the pre&s;ident, and appointed envoy for that purpo&s;e, to repair to Madrid, and &s;eizing the favourable moment for effecting it, to accompli&s;h this de&s;irable work. This was accordingly done, with equal prompt|ne&s;s and deci&s;ion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American &s;ecretary in the cabinet, are the United States indebted for the mo&s;t liberal, ho|nourable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet en|tered into with a foreign nation.&mdash;Here the review of the public life and labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on cea&s;es.</P>
<P>About this time, having, at the pre&s;&s;ing entreaty of the then pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, remained one year longer at the head of the department of &s;tate, than he had before &s;tipulated to do, he re&s;igned his office, and retired with the warme&s;t thanks and re|gret of the pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, to his e&s;tate at Mon|ticello, in Albemarle County, Virginia, where he con|tinued for upwards of two years uninterruptedly to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic ea&s;e, and a re&s;pite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favourite pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophical re&s;earch and agri|cultural improvement, until the voice of his country again &s;ummoned him to the more active &s;cenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the pre&s;idential chair, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Wa&s;hington. The i&s;&s;ue of that election is well known, and but for a fal&s;e return in one &s;tate, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a return in another, Mr. Jeffer&s;on would have been declared pre&s;ident, as the returns however &s;tood before Congre&s;s, it appeared that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, con&s;equently the latter was declared pre&s;ident, and the former vice-pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>In the month of January, 1797, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was elected pre&s;ident of the American Philo&s;ophical Society, held at Philadelphia, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the great and vir|tuous Rittenhou&s;e, who was the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of our immortal Franklin, the founder of that &s;ociety.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens of the United States;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In the foregoing addre&s;s you are pre&s;ented with two very oppo&s;ite characters of Mr. Jeffer&s;on:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, written by the pen of his enemies, conceived in malignity and malevolence, under the powerful in|fluence of party feeling and political re&s;entment, exhi|bits him to you as the wor&s;t of men, an enemy to his God, an enemy to his country, an enemy to the human race. It derives a momentary &s;upport from the ba&s;e&s;t fabrications and wickede&s;t fal&s;ehoods. It cannot long deceive, &s;ince it fully betrays the jealou&s;y, fear and anger of its authors; jealou&s;y, of his unrivalled talents; fear, that on his elevation to the pre&s;idency, every germ of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy in our country will di&s;&s;i|pate at the electrical touch of his republican virtues; and anger, that notwith&s;tanding all their detractious ef|forts, he continues to po&s;&s;e&s;s the un&s;haken and undimi|ni&s;hed confidence of the great body of the American people.</P>
<P>The latter character of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, is drawn not by the partial hand of a friend, nor under the influence of political or party prejudices: there is no need of fa|brication, fal&s;ehood or deception. You &s;ee it in the faithful and unerring record of his many great and virtuous deeds; in the public u&s;efulne&s;s and eminent &s;ervices of a well &s;pent life; in the numerous te&s;ti|monials of his country's approbation, and, by the uni|ver&s;al &s;uffrage of the foreign world, in their acknow|ledged tributes of re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the talents of his head and the virtues of his heart. Its leading fea|tures pre&s;ent to you a man of pure, ardent and unaffected piety; of &s;incere and genuine virtue; of an enlightened mind and &s;uperior wi&s;dom; the adorer of our God; the patriot of his country; and the friend and bene|factor of the whole human race.</P>
<P>And &s;uch fellow citizens, is the TRUE and REAL cha|racter of THOMAS JEFFERSON, unaided by artificial co|lourings or the fal&s;e varni&s;h of deceptive flattery.</P>
