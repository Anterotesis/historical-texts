<P>THE motto of this paper gives a &s;pecimen of Roman, the proceedings again&s;t America, of Engli&s;h policy.&mdash;There is, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, a compact, either expre&s;s, or im|plyed, between every &s;overeign and &s;ubject. Pro|tection and obedience are the mutual &s;tipulations, if the one is withdrawn, the other cea&s;es. Now, protection is certainly withdrawn, when &s;ubjects, guilty of no ho&s;tile or rebellious act, (I defy the mini&s;try to prove one again&s;t them) are neverthe|le&s;s treated (like the Americans) as enemies and rebels. Admini&s;tration, mo&s;t fal&s;ely and auda|ciou&s;ly, &s;tigmatize them with the name of rebels, merely to colour their own ba&s;e de&s;igns, and un|ju&s;tifiable
<PB N="130" REF="013982_0002_0F925989A5B5ABD8">ho&s;tilities again&s;t their fellow-&s;ubjects; in whom they di&s;cern an odious &s;pirit of liberty, which &s;ets (for them) a dangerous example to the mother country. The noble flame is dying here, and it would be fatal to mini&s;terial de&s;igns, that it &s;hould be cheri&s;hed in any part of our dominions.</P>
<P>The &s;pirited Americans feel this truth, they fore|&s;ee, and wi&s;ely guard again&s;t the danger. They have convened, and con&s;ulted for the public &s;afety, like true Britons. What then? Is &s;uch a national, political congre&s;s, a traiterous a&s;&s;ociation? At &s;uch a time too, and in &s;uch a cau&s;e? Is the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of America (a nation in point of territory and numbers) to be compared to that of Truro (a rotten borough) in Cornwall? Buffoonery in &s;erious ca&s;es, Doctor John&s;on, di&s;honours human nature, and degrades human under&s;tanding. Not even the example of your ma&s;ter, Doctor, who played Fal&s;taff, after he had deluded a late unhap|py Lord Chancellor of England into &s;uicide, can &s;anctify dramatic plea&s;antry, at the expence of life, liberty, property, and a whole country.</P>
<P>"Kill the next Piercy your&s;elf," my lord, is a &s;pecies of drollery, in a ca&s;e of blood, unworthy even of a hackney writer; as to you, Doctor John|&s;on,&mdash;I do not expect you will write hone&s;tly, but write &s;en&s;ibly. Treat &s;ubjects, (which might even affect the humanity of a Scotchman) no more lu|dicrou&s;ly, indecently, unfeelingly, and abandonly. With your leave, Doctor, I once more call Ame|rica a nation, and a great nation; too far di&s;tant from her mother country, to receive from her either
<PB N="135" REF="013982_0003_0F92598A3ABFF678">colonies, Thus, (&s;ays Dr. John&s;on) they have defrauded their creditors here, and condemned our merchants to bankruptcy. If creditors and mer|chants &s;uffer, if manufacturers complain, they mu&s;t recur to the fir&s;t cau&s;e. The&s;e are the pernicious effects of the wi&s;e &s;teps, taken fir&s;t by the mini&s;te|rial aggre&s;&s;ors in this country. Nor is it to be won|dered at, if the con&s;equence of the&s;e ra&s;h and un|ju&s;t proceedings by the harpies of power, &s;hould produce (in ca&s;e of an approaching war with France and Spain) a general bankruptcy of this nation.&mdash; A thought by no means chimerical, but truly me|lancholy; a thought, which can neither be baffled by the buffoonery of hackney &s;cribblers, the grave &s;arca&s;ms of &s;tate&s;men, or the cruel plea&s;antry of thoughtle&s;s Maje&s;ty it&s;elf.</P>
