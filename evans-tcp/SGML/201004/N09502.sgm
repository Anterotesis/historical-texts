<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN, FELLOW-STUDENTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS being the Day, on which their Maje&s;ties, King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant their Royal Charter for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of an Academy in this infant Colony; you will accept, it is hoped, a &s;hort Tribute to the Memory of our illu&s;trious Founders.</P>
<P>The In&s;titution of this Seat of Science is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to win them the Heart of every grateful <HI>Virginian;</HI> but the other Actions of their Lives are &s;uch as mu&s;t render their Names, forever, &s;acred. If there be any Period in the Annals of Hi&s;tory, which de&s;erves the Attention of Po&s;terity, and which may hold forth to future Ages, a Le&s;&s;on, we may confidently affirm it to be the glorious Revolution. During a long Cour&s;e of Years, which preceded this Event, the Scepter of <HI>England</HI> had been &s;wayed by arbitrary Hands. The Con&s;titution was wrenched from its natural Frame; the Rights of the Subject were invaded by the Sovereign; and Nothing was heard but the Groans of the Oppre&s;&s;ed. Learning drooped, Trade &s;tagnated, and Liberty was exiled. Parliaments, once, the Security of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects, were now &s;tript of all their Authority. Through the whole Kingdom not a Patriot was found, who dur&s;t &s;tand forth in Defence of his Country. Though every Member of the Community had been repeatedly in|&s;ulted by the Pride of foreign Enemies; though Dangers threatened from every Quarter; though the Blood of Millions called for Ven|geance; the Prince, di&s;&s;olved in Luxury, and intoxicated with Plea|&s;ure, &s;tudied Nothing but to protract an inglorious Peace. To com|pleat the whole, Popery was introduced, Prote&s;tants per&s;ecuted, Mo|rality reviled, and Virtue driven from the Realm. At this Juncture, <HI>William</HI> &s;tept in, a&s;cended the Throne, and <HI>England</HI> no longer lament|ed her bani&s;hed Freedom. Parliaments were re&s;tored to their former Influence, the Pride of her Enemies was humbled, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of her Subjects &s;ecured.</P>
<P>To all the amiable Qualities which throw a Radiance round a private Station, <HI>William</HI> added tho&s;e which reflect a Splendor on the Throne. Unlike the preceding Monarchs, he &s;acrificed Ea&s;e, Plea&s;ure,
<PB N="6" REF="012095_0005_0F89C447F6D83CC8">and every &s;elfi&s;h Con&s;ideration to the Welfare of the State. As a Soldier, he was prudent, active, and undaunted; as a Sovereign, gracious, intelligent, and penetrating. See him in the Field, and he appears a Being of a &s;uperior Order! Behold him in the Cabinet, and you are &s;urprized at a Genius, &s;o fertile in Re&s;ources! His Hand was always uplifted again&s;t the Enemies of <HI>England;</HI> and the Subject of his Meditations was the Good of Mankind. Flattery and Fear fled from his Pre&s;ence, and none but the hone&s;t and the brave were admitted to his Councils. His own Happine&s;s, he con&s;idered as interwoven with the Happine&s;s of his People. He was &s;en&s;ible that an In&s;ult to the Subject, was an In&s;ult to the Sovereign, and that the Poverty of the Nation mu&s;t end in his own Di&s;grace. Allegiance and Protection were, with him, reciprocal Ties. Nor did his Care extend only to the civil Intere&s;ts of his Subjects; he was al&s;o the watchful Guardian of their religious Rights. He knew that, in Things of a &s;piritual Nature, Man is not amenable to Man; that the Determina|tions of Rea&s;on are the &s;ole Rules of his Conduct, and the Dictates of Con&s;cience, the Sanctions of his Maker. He &s;aw how ab&s;urd it was to pre&s;cribe to others, a Religion; how unju&s;t to puni&s;h them for not embracing his own. To the Members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church he gave peculiar Marks of his Friend&s;hip; while the hone&s;t Di&s;&s;enter partook of his Favors. To a&s;cribe to Merit its Due, his Virtues as a Man, and his Actions as a Prince, were &s;uch as made an a&s;toni&s;hed World gaze on him with Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>His Royal Con&s;ort joined him, in all his Efforts, to &s;ave and to &s;erve the Kingdom. While he was at the Head of an Army abroad, &s;he held the Reins of Government at Home: And &s;uch was her Conduct, that under her Admini&s;tration, all Ranks of People thought them|&s;elves happy. She was open to Conviction, ruffled by no Pa&s;&s;ion, and free from the lea&s;t Taint of Vice. Her Sentiments were the Sentiments of a chri&s;tian Prince&s;s; of a pious Sovereign, who wept, in &s;ecret, at the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her Subjects, and beheld them, in public, with maternal Affection.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the many Virtues of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary;</HI> not|with&s;tanding the many Ble&s;&s;ings, from them, derived to the Nation;
<PB N="7" REF="012095_0006_0F89C448F05B7888">their Characters were wounded by the invenomed Shafts of Detraction and their Per&s;ons expo&s;ed to the cruel Daggers of Con&s;piracy. Ingra+titude &s;oon forgot the Hand which re&s;cued her from De&s;truction and that Hero, who had fought &s;o many Battles, retrieved the Glory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms and delivered <HI>Britain</HI> her&s;elf from Chains, was cen&s;ured for too warm an Attachment to the Country of his Birth. His Memory hath been reviled, by his Enemies, for having embroiled his Kingdom in foreign Connections. But is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he thought the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the Con+tinent one? It is certain that Nothing but the united Efforts of the allied Armies, could have reduced <HI>France</HI> from the Zenith of her Ambition to a State of Mi&s;ery and De&s;pair. So that from this, as well as from all the other Actions of his Life, it appears that he had mo&s;t at Heart the Good of <HI>England:</HI> And not to have made the Pro&s;perity of his native Land, the &s;econd Object of his Attention, would have argued him highly ungrateful. He is charged with the Crime al&s;o of depo&s;ing his Uncle and Father-in-Law. But it would have been his Duty to have torn the Tyrant from the Throne, had <HI>James</HI> been his Brother or his Father. The Name of <HI>Timoleon</HI> illumines the Page of <HI>Grecian</HI> Hi&s;tory. The remote&s;t Corners of the World re&s;ound with the Fame of <HI>Brutus:</HI> And &s;hall Envy ob&s;cure the Glory of <HI>William?</HI> Forbid it Heaven! The la&s;t Accu&s;ation is, that he was a &s;ullen, and imperious Sovereign. Read the Annals of his Reign, and let Ju&s;tice decide. With how much Equity, with how much Lenity did he govern that Kingdom, before di&s;tracted with civil Commotions? With what Humanity did he treat tho&s;e whom he knew to be Foes both of his Government, and his Per&s;on? Even the Rebels of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and the Papi&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> felt the kindly Influence of his &s;ym|pathizing Heart.</P>
<P>To return to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of this College: Does this look like the offspring of a &s;ullen Di&s;po&s;ition? No; it "bears the more im|mediate Stamp of Heaven." And &s;o long as Time &s;hall endure Here, &s;hall "grateful Science &s;till adore her <HI>William</HI>'s holy Shade." Before this Period, our intellectual World was "without Form and void,
<PB N="8" REF="012095_0007_0F89C449758BA058">and Darkne&s;s was upon the Face of the Deep." But his Voice &s;pake the Chaos into Order: He &s;aid, "let there be Light! And there was Light." Education aro&s;e, its Beams broke forth, di&s;pelled the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Error, and gilded the Clouds of Opinion. A thou&s;and hidden Qualities &s;prung up, which without its genial Influence had never been di&s;interred. The unrelenting was &s;oftened into Pity, and the Barbarian wondered by what Means he became broken into Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">. Happy, my Fellow-Students, are we, who&s;e good Fortune it was to be born in the golden Age of our Country. We have Advantages which to our Progenitors were not known. Their Knowledge was circum&s;cribed by the gloomy Woods, which &s;urrounded the narrow Spots they had cleared. Ours is unconfined; the Cu&s;toms, the Man|ners, the Laws of every Nation are open to our View. We can un|lock the &s;acred Fountains of Antiquity, in&s;pect the Policy of Ages pa&s;t, and, from thence, gather the In&s;tructions of Wi&s;dom to guide our future Conduct. It is in our Power, if we be not wanting to our&s;elves, to &s;upport with Dignity the Cau&s;e of Religion, to &s;u&s;tain with Firmne&s;s the Rights of Society, and to interpret with Preci&s;ion the Laws of our Country. But let each of us remember that upon his own Indu&s;try depends all that can make him an Honor to this Temple of Science, a Ble&s;&s;ing to the State, and an Ornament to Hu|manity. Nor does a good Education qualify us for public Stations alone. By its Help we are capacitated for di&s;charging every Duty, and for reli&s;hing all the Sweets of private Life. Under its Au&s;pices we may meet Adver&s;ity, in all her gorgon Terrors, without Di&s;may.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s on your Patience no longer than to conclude with the following Lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>Forever, as the circling Years return,</L>
<L>Grateful VIRGINIANS! crown the Hero's Urn;</L>
<L>To his ju&s;t Care you every Ble&s;&s;ing owe,</L>
<L>Which, or his own, or following Reigns be&s;tow.</L>
<L>Tho' his hard Fate a Father's Name deny'd,</L>
<L>To you a Father, he that Lo&s;s &s;upply'd.</L>
