It may not be improper in di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e Words, to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Cau&s;es of Men's being given unto change.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place, I &s;hall repre&s;ent the Danger of engaging with Men that are addicted to change.</P>
<P>And &s;hall in the la&s;t Place, make &s;uch Improvements as Time and the De&s;ign I have in View will admit of.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Cau&s;es why Men are given to change.

Men mea&s;uring them&s;elves by their own fond Conceit and fanta&s;tical Imaginations, are led on to think that the World &s;hould pay them the &s;ame Re&s;pect and Adoration that they vainl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imagine is due to them, and conclude them&s;elves neglected, overlook|ed, nay, affronted, if their Expectations are baulk'd, and they hap|pen to be con&s;ider'd as &s;econd to any. Now, when this is the Ca&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Government upon Earth to gratify &s;uch Pre|tenders: For as there may be many Competitors, and only one Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be di&s;po&s;ed of, upon being di&s;appointed, <HI>&s;uch unea&s;y Spirits w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> naturally form Parties, and fall into Faction. We are they that oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;peak, who is Lord over us?</HI> P&s;al. the 12.4. v.&mdash;</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e which contributes greatly to Factions and Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|orders in Civil Societies, is the Fury, the Violence of Men's Pa&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>Another Cau&s;e I &s;hall ju&s;t mention, which may contribute to pro|mote Factions and Di&s;orders in regular, well con&s;tituted Bodies, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ragmatical, bu&s;y, intermedling Temper.

<P>I might a&s;&s;ign many more Cau&s;es for Men's being addicted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hange; but as the&s;e &s;eem to be the principal, on which all others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave a natural Dependance, I &s;hall pro&s;ecute this Point no fur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her; but,</P>
<P>Proceed to my &s;econd Head, to lay before you the great Danger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Folly of engaging with tho&s;e who are given to change.</P>
<P>I need not make u&s;e of Arguments, I believe, to convince you, that Men upon their enli&s;ting into Parties and Factions, may de&s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one&s;tly and innocently; they may be told, their Religion, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iberties, their Properties are in Danger; and the&s;e we are all &s;atis|fied may prove very engaging Motives to hone&s;t well de&s;igning Men, to join with &s;uch Per&s;ons as they e&s;teem zealous A&s;&s;erters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Defenders of &s;uch invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings and Privileges.

An undoubted In&s;tance of this fir&s;t we have in the Ca&s;e of the Royal Martyr.

<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Hazael</HI> &s;eems very a propos to the Subject I am no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon.

Surely &s;uch Wretches mu&s;t have been addicted to change with a Vengeance, who could prevail upon them&s;elves to join the Inhabitants of <HI>Babylon,</HI> to ra&s;e the Walls of their own <HI>Sion,</HI> to con&s;pire and rebel again&s;t a Prince, who is a Defender of the Faith they profe&s;s, and to join with one who by the Principles of his Re|ligion, is under the mo&s;t &s;olemn Obligations to de&s;troy it. But this requires a more particular Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Now, what can be more a&s;toni&s;hing? How could &s;uch a Relation ever obtain Credit, were it not verified in Fact, that any of our Fellow Subjects &s;hould be given over to &s;uch Infatuation; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> &s;hould have &s;o little Regard either to his Religion or the Welfare of his native Country, as upon any Account what&s;oever, to favour and encourage the Introduction of <HI>Popery,</HI> and the bringing over a <HI>French Army</HI> to &s;ubdue and en&s;lave it? Oh! <HI>tell it not in Goth, publi&s;h it not in the Streets of A&s;kalon!</HI></P>
<P>But however, &s;uch it &s;eems there are Many; Many who have dared to lift up their treacherous Hands again&s;t that very <HI>Crown</HI> they had &s;worn to &s;upport upon his Maje&s;ty's Head, and to &s;et up the <HI>Standard</HI> of that <HI>Pretender</HI> whom they had frequently and &s;olemnly abjured: Many who have been audacious enough to proclaim the Title of their <HI>&s;ham Prince,</HI> with tho&s;e very Tongues with which they had often &s;worn, that he had no Right or Title what&s;oever to the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and with which they had imprecated the Divine Vengeance upon their own Heads, if they did not act &s;incerely. Can &s;uch Mon&s;ters as the&s;e hope for Succe&s;s? What do they take the Almighty to be? Think they that he can be impo&s;ed upon with broken Vows and Perjury? Can &s;uch be delivered? Oh, no! God has declared him&s;elf a jealous God, a God that will not hold them Guiltle&s;s that take his Name in vain.&mdash;But let us pau&s;e and con&s;ider, what Arguments can be framed, what Excu&s;es or Pretences made for this unnatural Rebellion, this turning our Mother Country into a Scene of Confu&s;ion and Blood. Can his Maje&s;ty's Right and Title be di&s;puted? Is not his Claim as good a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any Prince's in Europe? Has not the Crown been &s;ettled on him by the concurring Votes of Lords and Common, under the au&s;piciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

And has not this Title been recognized in mo&s;t &s;olemn Prayers and Thank&s;givings to Almighty God, when Men could not prevaricate without the vile&s;t Hypocri&s;y? I know there has a Noi&s;e been made about indefea&s;ible hereditary Right, and the like; but the Advocates for that Scheme have not duly con&s;idered, that <HI>that</HI> Doctrine will invalidate the Right of any Prince upon Earth; for upon their Hy|pothe&s;is, there can be but one Per&s;on in the Univer&s;e, that has any Right to be a King, and he mu&s;t prove him&s;elf de&s;cended in a right Line from the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> the Con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be Di&s;order, Anarchy, Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, this Hypothe&s;is will appear altogether whim&s;ical, whether we con&s;ult the Laws of God, or the Laws and Cu&s;toms of our own Country.

If we con&s;ult the Laws and Cu&s;toms of our own Country, we &s;hall find, that from <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, (in which Time we have a Succe&s;&s;ion of thirty and one Kings and Queens) we have not had above four, who have &s;ucceeded one another in (what is called) <HI>the right Line;</HI> and we &s;hall there likewi&s;e find, that in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> it was enacted High Trea&s;on to que&s;tion the Power of Queen and Parliament to limit and bind the Crown, and the De&s;cent and Inheritance thereof. The&s;e Authorities &s;hew (beyond all Contradiction) that his Maje&s;ty's Title to the Crown of his Realms is con&s;i&s;tent with, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd both by the Laws of God, and the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Land.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;econdly.</HI> May not his Maje&s;ty have exerci&s;ed &s;ome Acts of Tyranny and arbitrary Power? May he not have made his Will the Mea&s;ure of his Actions, and govern'd by Lu&s;t, Prejudice or Fancy? How the Subject is to &s;eek for Relief in &s;uch difficult Circum&s;tances as the&s;e, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to determine: But this we are certain of, that nothing of this Sort can be objected again&s;t our Sovereign, by the mo&s;t audacious and in&s;olent of tho&s;e Rebels that are, or have been in Arms again&s;t him.
