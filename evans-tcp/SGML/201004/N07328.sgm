<HEAD>A Candid Examination of Dr. MAYHEW'S Ob&s;ervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in Foreign Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a long time &s;ince Dr. MAYHEW publi&s;hed his <HI>mode&s;t</HI> ob&s;ervations, on the charter and con|duct of the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts; and as no per&s;on hitherto has thought it worth his while to enter into a &s;pe|cial examination of his principal argument, he pro|bably concluded that his performance would not have met with a full reply. And in truth if he had drawn this conclu&s;ion from the nature and manner of his writing, as being too intemperately manag'd to de&s;erve the notice of either a Gentleman or a Scholar, he had thought as other men do; for this, it has been &s;aid is the true rea&s;on, why he has been &s;uffer'd to triumph thus long in his performance, and to boa&s;t of it as unan&s;werable. Every gentle|man who has had a liberal and polite education, thinks it beneath his character to enter the li&s;ts with one who ob&s;erves no mea&s;ures of decency or good manners, nay who does not &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the meek and gentle &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel to the gratifi|cation of a licentious and ungovernd temper. Nor does the author of the pre&s;ent remarks pretend to rival him in this unbecoming talent; herein he is al|low'd
<PB N="2" REF="009360_0005_103211B378EADCA0">to reign without a competitor. But &s;ince he is liable to "think more highly of him&s;elf than he ought to think," and is already unhappily "wi&s;er in his own conceit," than in any ones el&s;e; it may be e&s;teem'd an act of charity to give him ju&s;ter notions both of him&s;elf, and of his writings in general, but e&s;pecially of his late performance, than he &s;eems to have entertain'd.</P>
<P>THE method which will be u&s;ed in di&s;charging this charitable office, will be to repre&s;ent the Doctor &s;ometimes in the meek and benevolent light in which he affects to be con&s;idered; at other times, and by way of contra&s;t to this, he will be produced in the light in which he has really exhibited him&s;elf: For altho' the&s;e are toto coelo different, yet without a ju&s;t and impartial repre&s;entation of him in both the&s;e re&s;pects, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to give him a true knowledge of him&s;elf, which is a point the author is very &s;olicitous of; and is not without rea&s;onable hopes of accompli&s;hing.</P>
<P>TO this purpo&s;e the author propo&s;es to con&s;ult the Doctor's writings in general, which, as they are &s;ufficiently voluminous, will afford abundant matter for &s;uch a repre&s;entation, and being all of them corrected with his own hand, and &s;ent abroad by his own appointment, may fairly be conceived to be a genuine picture of the man.</P>
<P>IT will be proper to begin with his la&s;t and high|ly boa&s;ted piece, entitled <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the charter and conduct of the Society,</HI> &amp;c. The Introduction to which begins with the&s;e remarkable words, <Q>There are &s;ome men who write&mdash;controver&s;y merely from a wrangling di&s;po&s;ition, without any regard to truth, right, or the importance of the matters conte&s;ted.</Q> Now one may defy any
<PB N="3" REF="009360_0006_103211B55D352088">man who &s;hall read this pa&s;&s;age, and e&s;pecially if he has read two or three volumes of &s;ermons publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton &s;ince the year 1754, and &s;ome occa&s;ional thank&s;giving di&s;cour&s;es, in almo&s;t every one of which matters of controver&s;y have been dragg'd in, tho' for the mo&s;t part as it were by head and &s;houlders; I &s;ay, I defy any &s;uch man, not to think of <HI>one</HI> who &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>pa&s;tor of the we&s;t church in Bo&s;ton.</HI> And no doubt every one will be ready to join with the Dr. in the words immediately following, "that this is a turn of mind unbecoming a chri&s;tian." And had he not been too unhappily inattentive to his own maxim as before cited, doubtle&s;s he would here have dropp'd his pen. <Q>But &s;ome of his friends</Q> too "partial" indeed "in his favor" inju|diciou&s;ly prevented him from profiting by his own admonition, having it &s;eems "expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that" notwith&s;tanding <HI>"his" great</HI> <Q><HI>aver&s;ion to controver&s;y</HI> &mdash;he would&mdash;communicate <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his thoughts to the public, on the point in que&s;tion. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations p. 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>IN the 8th page of his ob&s;ervations, the Doctor affects to be very candid and ingenuous. <Q>He is &s;en&s;ible" he &s;ays, "that the Society are a very re|&s;pectable Body, and to be treated with all the regard that is con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice&mdash; he declares it is by no means his intention to charge that venerable Body with any <HI>wilful</HI> known mi&s;conduct, or improper application of monies.</Q> This is very commendable, if he had but kept it in mind through the whole of his polite inquiry; but as though he was &s;en&s;ible he &s;hould very &s;oon break through the afore&s;aid equitable rule, <Q>he reque&s;ts the candor of his readers, that no advantage may be taken of any <HI>incautious expre&s;&s;ion</HI> that may <HI>e&s;cape</HI> him in the pur&s;uit of his argument, even
<PB N="4" REF="009360_0007_103211B761047038">tho' it &s;hould at <HI>fir&s;t view,</HI> have the <HI>appearance</HI> of &s;uch an accu&s;ation. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations P. 8.</NOTE></Q> This however is a rea&s;on|able po&s;tulatum, and therefore it is not propo&s;ed, nay, the author hereby promi&s;es the gentleman that he will not take advantage of <HI>one</HI> or even of <HI>two</HI> incautious expre&s;&s;ions, that appear unde&s;ignedly to have e&s;caped him, if at <HI>fir&s;t view only</HI> they have the <HI>bare appearance</HI> of &s;uch an accu&s;ation; but then he cannot extend the &s;ame indulgence to <HI>very many</HI> expre&s;&s;ions importing a charge of wilful known mi&s;|conduct, and improper application of monies; e&s;pecially, if not only at the <HI>fir&s;t view,</HI> but on a &s;econd and third view, they do not appear to have merely e&s;caped him, but were manife&s;tly intended to &s;upport &s;uch an accu&s;ation. Much le&s;s will he be intitled to this indulgence, if it &s;hall appear that the Society are directly charged by him with mi&s;ap|plication of the monies committed to their tru&s;t, in numerous pa&s;&s;ages of his book, but moreover, that the general de&s;ign of it was, an attempt to prove this very point.</P>
<P>THE Dr.'s book is entitled <Q>Ob&s;ervations on the charter and conduct of the Society, &amp;c. <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to &s;hew their non-conformity to each other.</Q> In &s;upport of this title, after &s;ometimes contracting, then &s;tretching and wire-drawing the &s;en&s;e of the charter, &s;eal, &amp;c. of the Society, he concludes that the <HI>&s;ole</HI> de&s;ign of their in&s;titution was to propagate the go&s;pel among the heathen, or in tho&s;e colonies who&s;e religious &s;tate was, and according to him, now is, little better than heatheni&s;m. But this which he a&s;&s;erts to be the laudable and only de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, they have, he &s;ays, gro&s;sly perverted and abu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009360_0008_103211B940454660">
THUS in page 55, he &s;ays <Q>the Society have ma|nife&s;ted a &s;ufficient forwardne&s;s to encourage and increa&s;e &s;mall di&s;affected parties in our towns, upon an application to them.</Q> And in the 57th page he repre&s;ents the Society as hoping that the&s;e &s;mall parties will by their influence gradually bring on a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an epi&s;copal &s;overeign; and <Q>affirms that this has long been the formal de&s;ign of the Society, and is the true plan and grand my&s;tery of their operations in New-England.</Q></P>
<P>IN his 106th page he tells us that the <Q>affair of Bi&s;hops in America, has been a favourite object with the Society," and in the next page, that the Society &s;pare neither endeavours, applications, nor expence, in order to effect their <HI>grand de&s;ign</HI> of <HI>epi&s;copizing</HI> all New-England,</Q> and a few lines further, <Q>The Society have long had a <HI>formal de&s;ign</HI> to di&s;&s;olve and root out all our New-England churches.&mdash;This (he &s;ays) fully and clearly ac|counts for their being &s;o ready to encourage &s;mall epi&s;copal parties all over New-England, by &s;end|ing them mi&s;&s;ionaries.</Q> In page 110 he affirms that <Q>the Society have been expending large &s;ums every year in New-England, <HI>quite beyond the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution,</HI> to &s;upport and increa&s;e the epi&s;|copal party as &s;uch.</Q> In the &s;ame page he charges the Society with robbing the heathen to ea&s;e and gratify the epi&s;copalians here, and forms this conclu|&s;ion upon his foregoing repre&s;entations, that <Q>the Society are guilty of a flagrant abu&s;e of a noble in&s;titution.</Q> And in the 112th page, that they have <Q>alienated their revenues from a truly noble to a comparatively mean, narrow, party de&s;ign.</Q> After the&s;e &s;everal direct and plain accu&s;ations of the Society as abu&s;ing their tru&s;t, and mi&s;applying the
<PB N="6" REF="009360_0009_103211BB21971348">money put into their hands, he wipes his mouth again, and ab&s;urdly enough a&s;&s;ures his reader, that <Q>he would by no means be under&s;tood as charging &s;o re&s;pectable a Body with any wilful criminal abu&s;e of power, or mi&s;application of monies.</Q> i. e. he would not have the reader believe him; for that is the &s;en&s;e of his words, as they &s;tand connected with what went before, if indeed they have any &s;en&s;e at all in them.</P>
<P>WILL he now have the <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> to a&s;&s;ert, that all the <HI>expre&s;&s;ions</HI> and pa&s;&s;ages which have been here quoted (and five times as many more might have been added) are only <HI>incautions expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> that inadvertently <HI>e&s;caped him,</HI> that they are not de|&s;igned as matter of <HI>accu&s;ation,</HI> and that if po&s;&s;ibly they have &s;uch an <HI>appearance,</HI> it is only <HI>at fir&s;t view?</HI> If he &s;hould a&s;&s;ert this. I am per&s;uaded his friends at lea&s;t mu&s;t blu&s;h for him. Is the &s;upporting &s;mall parties in New-England, in order to facilitate the affair of <HI>epi&s;copizing</HI> the colonies, <HI>the formal de&s;ign</HI> of the Society, to which they give their chief atten|tion, and to which the large&s;t part of their fund is applied? Can he a&s;&s;ert all this, and yet &s;ay that he does not charge that venerable Body <Q>with any wilful known mi&s;conduct, or improper application of monies?</Q></P>
<P>PERHAPS this <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> rea&s;oner will chu&s;e to &s;ay that the Society are mi&s;led, and form their plan upon the mi&s;repre&s;entations of their <HI>wicked</HI> mi&s;&s;io|naries. Something like this is a&s;&s;erted in a note upon a than&s;giving &s;ermon on the reduction of Canada, preached and publi&s;hed by him in the year 1760. <Q>It is probable that they [the Society] have been gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the &s;tate of religion in the&s;e parts, which has
<PB N="7" REF="009360_0010_103211BDA5CDCF88">been the occa&s;ion of their employing &s;o much of their charitable care about tho&s;e who &s;o little need|ed it, to the neglect of tho&s;e who were peri&s;hing for want of it: For which impo&s;itions, abu&s;es and mi&s;applications, their deceivers are an&s;werable; if not to them, yet certainly to an HIGHER AU|THORITY.</Q> But &s;urely whatever repre&s;entations the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries have made, the Society mu&s;t judge whether the complying with &s;uch repre&s;enta|tions was, or was not con&s;i&s;tent with their charter; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding his &s;triving to palliate his accu&s;ation of the Society, by ca&s;ting the odium of a pretended mi&s;application of their charity on the mi&s;&s;ionaries, the &s;lander will &s;till remain where he at fir&s;t placed it, on the Society them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, the members of the Society are not all of them utterly unacquainted with the plantations; &s;ome of them have heretofore, and others do even now re&s;ide in mo&s;t of the governments upon the continent, (New-England not excepted) many of them not incon&s;i|derable for their &s;tation, wi&s;dom and integrity. The&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t therefore be al&s;o in a combi|nation with the mi&s;&s;ionaries to abu&s;e the world, and mi&s;apply the monies entru&s;ted with them. This &s;eems to be the con&s;equence of his general accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>IF the Dr. would &s;ay any thing further to &s;often the odium of this accu&s;ation which he has ca&s;t upon the Society, it mu&s;t be by a&s;&s;erting that they did not under&s;tand their own charter; this, if true, may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to take off the charge of wilful abu&s;e and mi&s;application; and that he &s;uppo&s;es it true is clear from hence, that he has &s;pent many pages and employed his great learning and penetration in explaining this intricate charter, that the Society may no longer mi&s;apply their cha|rity
<PB N="8" REF="009360_0011_103211BF5289BA40">for want of under&s;tanding the real de&s;ign of their in&s;titution. It may be que&s;tioned however, whether his refin'd critici&s;m and curious explanation will merit the thanks of the venerable board. That untoward word <HI>orthodox,</HI> which &s;o much rai&s;es his indignation wherever he meets with it, will not per|haps after all his learned pains, &s;airly comprehend the di&s;&s;enters from a national e&s;tabli&s;hment. How|ever that be, there is certainly no method of recon|ciling his candid profe&s;&s;ions of ju&s;tice, decency and re&s;pect towards the Society, or his &s;olemn declara|tion that it is not his intention to charge that venerable Body with <HI>wilful known</HI> mi&s;conduct: I &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the&s;e things, with the numerous abu&s;es, accu&s;ations and indecencies which have been already produced, and with which he has treated that re&s;pectable Body directly or im|plicitly, in almo&s;t every page of his book.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Society either have, or have not acted contrary to the meaning and de&s;ign of their charter; that they have not, is at lea&s;t highly pro|bable from the character of wi&s;dom, honor and piety, which the world will generally allow to tho&s;e of them at lea&s;t, who are chiefly active and intere&s;t|ed in managing their affairs. If they have acted contrary to the de&s;ign of it, as the Dr. affirms (and pretends to think he has prov'd) they have either done &s;o <HI>wilfully,</HI> or thro' ignorance. That they have not done it wilfully, the Dr. him&s;elf allows; it remains then, according to him, that their mi&s;|conduct is owing to ignorance: Either they have mi&s;under&s;tood the true and real de&s;ign of their charter, or have not a competent knowledge of the &s;tate of religion in the plantations, or how their affairs are conducted there, being impo&s;ed on by the
<PB N="9" REF="009360_0012_103211C12D9B4718">repre&s;entation of their mi&s;&s;ionaries, or that both the&s;e things concur to mi&s;lead them, into an abu&s;e of their in&s;titution. The latter &s;eems to be his &s;en&s;e of the thing, viz. that they are ignorant both of the true meaning of their charter, and al&s;o of the &s;tate of religion in the plantations; for he &s;ays in the clo&s;e of his introduction, that <Q>the profe&s;s'd de|&s;ign of his ob&s;ervations is to &s;hew, that they (the Society) have in &s;ome re&s;pects counteracted and defeated the truly noble ends of their INSTITU|TION, however <HI>contrary to their intention.</HI></Q> Whe|ther they have done &s;o or not, will fall under exa|mination hereafter. In the mean time I &s;hall take leave of his introduction with this &s;ingle remark, that from the pa&s;&s;ages already quoted, as well as from many others that might have been produced from this curious book of ob&s;ervations, it appears that the profe&s;&s;ions of candor and ingenuity which the Dr. &s;et out with, and his declaration of re&s;pect for &s;o venerable a body as the Society, are mere affectation and grimace, and tend only to prove that he "knows not what manner of &s;pirit he is of."</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved before, that according to the Dr's repre&s;entation the Society are ignorant of the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of their charter, and al&s;o of the &s;tate of religion in the plantations; for the a&s;&s;erts that they have greatly perverted the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, and yet will not allow their mi&s;conduct to be wilful; it remains therefore that their mi&s;ap|plication of the tru&s;t they have undertaken, is owing to ignorance.</P>
<P>It will be proper therefore to inquire fir&s;t, Whether the Society mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a competent knowledge of the &s;tate of religion in the plantati|ons, &s;o far at lea&s;t as relates to the de&s;ign of their in|corporation. And,</P>

2. Whether they may not al&s;o rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed to under&s;tand the true &s;en&s;e, meaning and de|&s;ign of their charter; for it the&s;e two things can be proved to the &s;atisfaction of di&s;intere&s;ted and unprejudiced people, it will follow, either that the Society are not chargeable with mi&s;conduct and mi&s;|application of their charity, or if they are &s;o, that &s;uch mi&s;conduct is known, wilful and intended, which the Dr. does not allow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be examined is, Whether the Society have not a competent knowledge of the &s;tate of religion in the plantations. Dr. Humphries in his hi&s;tory of the Society page 22d, acquaints us, that <Q>upon their fir&s;t engaging in this work the Society pre&s;ently perceived it con&s;i&s;ted of three great branches, the care and in&s;truction of our own people, &s;ettled in the colonies; the conver|&s;ion of the Indian Savages, and the conver&s;ion of the Negroes. The Engli&s;h planters had a title to their fir&s;t care" &amp;c.&mdash; "The Society began therefore with the Engli&s;h, and &s;oon found there was more to be done among them, than they had as yet any views of effecting.</Q> He then proceeds to give <Q>a &s;mall &s;ketch of the &s;tate and condition of each colony, formed from accounts, the Go|vernors, and per&s;ons of the be&s;t note, &s;ent over to the corporation.</Q> I &s;hall omit what is &s;aid of the &s;outhern <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> colonies as Dr. Mayhew <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> calls them, becau&s;e the&s;e he allows to be proper objects of the Society's charity, and proceed to the &s;tate of religion in New-England as repre&s;ent|ed in the hi&s;tory before mentioned. After &s;peaking of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, and the &s;tate of religion in the early days of it, Dr. Humphries proceeds to &s;ay,&mdash; <Q>Since that time great numbers
<PB N="11" REF="009360_0014_103211C4F3224560">of people, members of the church of England, have at different times &s;ettled there, who thought them&s;elves &s;urely entituled, by the very New-England charter to a liberty of con&s;cience in the wor&s;hipping of God after their own way. Yet the Independents (it &s;eems) were not of this &s;en|timent, but acted as an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI>" "The members of the church of England in Bo&s;ton met with &s;o much ob&s;truction in attempting to &s;et up that form of wor&s;hip, that they were obliged to petition the King for protection. Their peti|tion was granted, and a Church thereupon erect|ed, which occa&s;ioned the members of the church of England in many other towns in New-England to declare their de&s;ire of the like advantage, and accordingly wrote very zealous letters to bi&s;hop Compton, for mini&s;ters; and now it appeared they were a very con&s;iderable body of people. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hemph. Hi&s;t p. 39.</NOTE></Q> From the&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, it appears that the Society did not proceed ha&s;tily and without due caution and information of the &s;tate of religion in the colonies which they propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t. Dr. Humphries goes on and &s;ums up the religious &s;tate of the colonies in a brief repre&s;entation of it, from the memorials of Governor Dudley, Col. Morris, and Col. Heath|cote. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the &s;outhern colonies for the rea&s;on before mentioned, and come to New-England.&mdash;<Q>In Connecticut colony in New-England there are about 30000 &s;ouls, of which when they have a mini&s;ter among them. about 150 frequent the church; and there are 35 commu|nicants. In Rhode-I&s;land and Narragan&s;et, which is one government, there are about 10000 &s;ouls, of which about 150 frequent the church, and there are 30 communicants. In Bo&s;ton and Pi&s;|cataway

<P>After &s;uch particular information from the me|morials of the&s;e honorable per&s;ons, perhaps no man except Dr. Mayhew and his voucher, will &s;uppo&s;e the Society could be ignorant of the &s;tate of religion in this part of the world, nor con&s;equently where it was mo&s;t proper to employ their charity. Agree|ably Dr. Humphreys acquaints us that <Q>the Gover|nors of &s;everal colonies, and other Gentlemen of character abroad, and merchants here in London, having given &s;uch a particular de&s;cription of the religious &s;tate of the plantations; the Society found it was high time to enter upon the good work"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humph.

<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding this particular information, &s;upported by many carne&s;t petitions from the plan|tations for mini&s;ters of the church of England, <Q>the Society thro' the whole management of the tru&s;t, have been &s;o far from obtruding the church of England wor&s;hip upon any &s;ort of people abroad&mdash;that they have not been able to give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to great numbers of people, who have in very moving terms, with a true chri&s;tian &s;pirit

I &s;hall give the reader (&s;ays he) a few petitions which &s;hew plainly the Society did not concern them&s;elves here, till they were loudly called upon; and that the inhabitants in many places, did not only fend petitions for mini&s;ters, but al&s;o built churches before they had any mi|ni&s;ters, which is an uncontroulable evidence&mdash; that the people them&s;elves de&s;ired to have the church of England wor&s;hip, with a hearty zeal and true &s;incerity.</Q> The Dr. then proceeds to &s;pecify as petitioners &s;everal inhabitants of Rhode-I&s;land, Narragan&s;et, Newbury, Marblehead, New-Hamp&s;hire, Little Compton and Tiverton, Braintree near Bo&s;ton, and Stratford in Connecticut.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humph.

Robert Hunter, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Go|vernor of New-York, in the year 1711, writes
<PB N="15" REF="009360_0018_103211CCB1826870">thus to the Society, concerning the people at Stratford: When I was at Connecticut, tho&s;e of our communion at the church at Stratford, came to me in a body; and then, as they have &s;ince by letter, begged my interce&s;&s;ion with the vene|rable Society, and the right reverend the Lord bi&s;hop of London, for a mi&s;&s;ionary; they ap|peared very much in earne&s;t, and are the be&s;t &s;et of men I met with in that country.</Q></P>
<P>How the&s;e &s;everal te&s;timonies which have been produc'd will operate upon Dr. Mayhew, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay; but to the &s;ober, judicious and unpreju|diced, the following conclu&s;ions may perhaps be thought fairly drawn, viz. That the Society have omitted no proper means of information concern|ing the &s;tate of religion in the colonies&mdash;That their religious &s;tate mu&s;t therefore be competently known to that venerable board&mdash;And that if they have been guilty of any notorious mi&s;conduct or mi&s;ap|plication of their charity, it could not be owing to ignorance of the true condition of things abroad, but mu&s;t be attributed to &s;ome other cau&s;e: For allowing what the Dr. has mo&s;t uncharitably inti|mated, that the mi&s;&s;ionaries have mi&s;repre&s;ented the condition of things among us, and by that means endeavoured to mi&s;lead the Society to an improper application of the monies lodged in their hands; yet can any mode&s;t per&s;on &s;uppo&s;e that Governors of colonies, merchants, and other gentlemen of character, have all along combined with the &s;aid <HI>wicked</HI> mi&s;&s;ionaries, to abu&s;e and mi&s;lead the Society into a wrong di&s;po&s;ition of their charity? Or is it probable that their own members, &s;everal of whom do re&s;ide in the colonies, &s;hould con&s;pire with the worthy per&s;ons before mentioned to carry on the
<PB N="16" REF="009360_0019_103211CED41CA6B0">deceit? It is hoped the Dr. him&s;elf is not &s;o far in|volved in a party &s;pirit as to affirm the probability of this, if he is, without doubt he is alone in &s;uch an uncharitable cen&s;ure. And therefore this point may be left without any further remarks, to the public opinion.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Inquiry is; Whether the Society may not rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the true &s;en&s;e, meaning and de&s;ign of their Charter.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who examine the li&s;t of members of which the Society is compo&s;ed, as it is exhibited in the yearly ab&s;tract of their proceedings, the pre&s;ent inquiry will appear very extraordinary. That a Sett of Gentlemen, many of them highly di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the world for their great parts, and exten&s;ive know|lege, &s;hould mi&s;take, or be at a lo&s;s about the true meaning of a charter, which has nothing at all in it that is intricate or ob&s;cure, is what no rea&s;onable per&s;on will admit. And notwith&s;tanding the Dr's <HI>refined critici&s;m,</HI> &s;ome may perhaps imagine that it mu&s;t ar|gue no &s;mall mea&s;ure of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency in any per|&s;on to oppo&s;e his &s;ingle &s;entiment, to that of &s;o learn|ed and re&s;pectable a body. Few be&s;ides the Dr. him&s;elf, will really believe that they needed his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance for acquiring a right under&s;tanding of their charter. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e very learn|ed divines, who from the beginning have compo&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of that body, &s;hould be le&s;s ac|quainted with the phra&s;e and purport of an in&s;tru|ment in &s;ome mea&s;ure foreign to their profe&s;&s;ion; yet doubtle&s;s the Lord Chancellor, the chief Ju&s;tices of the King's Bench and common pleas, who&s;e pe|culiar profe&s;&s;ion it is, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the nature of in&s;truments of this kind. And as the Society are obliged to exhibit an annual account of
<PB N="17" REF="009360_0020_103211D0AFE20A98">their proceedings to the&s;e very learned and worthy per&s;ons, it is &s;urprizing that they &s;hould &s;uffer them to proceed above 60 years, without once acquaint|ing them that their conduct was not agreeable to the <HI>Letter and Spirit</HI> of their charter. That the Society &s;hould at la&s;t be obliged to a <HI>profound critic</HI> in New-England for an ellucidation of this kind, after hav|ing &s;o many years &s;tood the te&s;t of an annual exa|mination, by tho&s;e whom the royal wi&s;dom thought proper to appoint as their &s;upervi&s;ors&mdash;Believe it they that can&mdash;</P>
<P>Some friend of the Dr's may po&s;&s;ibly here cry our, what would this remarker be at? The Dr. has plainly prov'd that the Society have been guilty of great mi&s;conduct, have acted quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the intent and de&s;ign of their charter, and from a principle of charity is willing to impute it to mi&s;information, or ignorance; while this writer who affects to be the friend of the Society is la|bouring to defeat the Dr's benevolent purpo&s;e, and &s;eems as tho' he de&s;igned to prove their mi&s;conduct to be wilful.</P>
<P>After thanking the candid Dr. for his good in|tention, the author confe&s;&s;es it is his opinion, and he thinks it has in &s;ome mea&s;ure been prov'd; either that the Society have not acted incon&s;i&s;tent with their charter, or if they have done &s;o, that it was knowingly, wilfully and de&s;ignedly done. The au|thor thinks, as all rea&s;onable men mu&s;t think, that the Society do very well under&s;tand the de&s;ign and meaning of their charter&mdash;And al&s;o that they have a competent knowledge of the &s;tate of religion in the plantations.</P>
<P>If the&s;e two things are allowed, the conclu&s;ion will unavoidably be what was mentioned before, viz.
<PB N="18" REF="009360_0021_103211D290166498">either that the Society have <HI>wilfully</HI> mi&s;conducted, of el&s;e, that there has been no mi&s;conduct in the ca&s;e&mdash;That they have <HI>wilfally</HI> mi&s;conducted the Dr. difallows, therefore, there has been no mi&s;econduct at all.&mdash;Here then the argument and imputation which the Dr. has ca&s;t upon the Society, drop of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>However, tho' the Dr. has been candid enough to clear the Society from any intentional abu&s;e of their charter, po&s;&s;ibly others may not be &s;o ingenu|ous. Be&s;ides it may be e&s;teemed unfair to take this advantage of the Dr's conce&s;&s;ion, to the neglect of tho&s;e many curious arguments he has brought to prove what he had before given up; for notwith|&s;tanding the incon&s;i&s;tency of it, he has throughout his book laboured to prove (that which he gave up in the beginning;) that the Society have really been guilty of wilful and de&s;igned abu&s;e of their tru&s;t. And therefore the author hopes the Dr. will forgive it, if upon a general view of the ob&s;ervations, he is led to que&s;tion the &s;incerity of that declaration be|fore mentioned, viz. <Q>That it is not his intention to charge that venerable body (the Society) with any wilful known mi&s;conduct or improper appli|cation of monies.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Noah Hobart (whom by the way the Dr. has dubb'd a <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> for his heroic exploits in this con|trover&s;y) has plainly &s;poke out, and directly charg|ed the Society with a de&s;igned abu&s;e and perver&s;ion of their tru&s;t, at lea&s;t &s;ince the fir&s;t ten years after their incorporation,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hobart's 2d Addre&s;s, p. 126. compar'd with following pages.</NOTE> though indeed like the Dr. he afterwards &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to retract the charge, and chu&s;es rather to impute it to their ignorance of the &s;tate of religion in New-England,
<PB N="19" REF="009360_0022_103211D4F7484860">and to the impo&s;ition and mi&s;repre&s;entation of their <HI>wicked</HI> mi&s;&s;ionaries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hob. 2d Addre&s;s, p. 145.</NOTE> But the author conceives it has already been proved that their conduct cannot be imputed to a want of knowledge, and whatever the di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Hobart or his copier may be, it is pre&s;umed that an accu&s;ation of the Society as wilfully betraying their tru&s;t, will be received by the impartial world, with the re&s;entment it de&s;erves. It is not the Society alone, who are thus unju&s;tly ar|raigned by the&s;e licentious pens, but the integrity and honor of their in&s;pectors al&s;o, the Lord chan|cellor and the chief ju&s;tices of the King's bench, who yearly examine and approve their tran&s;actions, do of con&s;equence &s;uffer impeachment by their ca|lumny; nay the exten&s;ive abu&s;e reaches to every benefactor to that Society, who, as an annual ac|count of their proceedings is publi&s;hed and put into their hands, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to approve them, &s;ince otherwi&s;e it is more than probable they would have withdrawn their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>As for the learned and ingenious Dr. Mayhew, he certainly de&s;cended very low, when he vouch&s;afed to become the tran&s;criber of Mr. Hobart's addre&s;s, for (excepting &s;ome per&s;onal reflections upon his antagoni&s;t) there appears little el&s;e throughout his ob&s;ervations, be&s;ides a &s;ervile copying of that curious peice <HI>of defamation.</HI> The method indeed he may claim to him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes the phra&s;e and man|ner of expre&s;&s;ion. The Dr. owns "the book has been of &s;ervice to him," and promi&s;ed to "make proper acknowledgments wherever he &s;hould make u&s;e of it" yet has not perhaps always been &s;o good as his word; nor will the empty honor of a <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> which he arbitrarily confers on him, be allow'd a
<PB N="20" REF="009360_0023_103211D680D64778">&s;ufficient compen&s;ation for the liberties of this kind which he has taken. He a&s;&s;erts that "Mr. Hobart wrote &s;o &s;olidly, and judiciou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject, that it was hardly needful for him to &s;ay any thing," this is granted, unle&s;s he could have advanced &s;ome|thing new, which the other had not offer'd before; e&s;pecially as Mr. Hobart's peice received as &s;olid and judicious an an&s;wer, which the Dr. thought proper wholly to neglect. In truth, had the Dr. but care|fully read the Rev. Mr. Beach's di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate but ma&s;terly reply to Mr. Hobart's &s;econd addre&s;s, he might have &s;een a full and compleat an&s;wer to all he has written (except what is merely per&s;onal) without breaking in upon that peaceable di&s;po&s;ition which gives him &s;uch "an <HI>aver&s;ion to controver&s;y.</HI>"</P>
<P>The Dr. affirms p. 18. That <Q>nothing is to be &s;uppo&s;ed the object, or any part of the object of this charitable and royal in&s;titution, but what plainly appears to be really &s;o, from the very words of the charter"&mdash; and a little after "the words of the charter it&s;elf mu&s;t determine and limit the &s;en&s;e of the royal Grantor, and con&s;e|quently the legal power conferred on the &mdash; Grantees.</Q> We &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently how far the Dr. adheres to his own invariable rule of interpre|tation. He confe&s;&s;es <Q>that the Briti&s;h plantations or the King's &s;ubjects were really the primary, more immediate object of this in&s;titution.</Q> And pray why not the &s;ole and entire object of it? There is certainly no other object "particularly ex|pre&s;&s;ed" in the charter, be&s;ides that of the King's &s;ubjects. Has he forgot what he had a&s;&s;erted but a few lines before, that <Q>nothing is to be &s;uppo&s;ed any part of the object of this in&s;titution, but what plainly appears to be &s;o from the very words of
<PB N="21" REF="009360_0024_103211D85B40D268">the charter.</Q> Why then are the King's &s;ubjects &s;aid to be the <HI>primary, more immediate,</HI> and not the <HI>&s;ole</HI> object of their in&s;titution? &s;ince they are the only object expre&s;ly mentioned in the <HI>very words of the charter.</HI> It was a &s;trange over&s;ight in this great critic, to depart &s;o &s;uddenly from his invariable rule; or perhaps there was a de&s;ign to be &s;erved in interpreting the charter by way of implication, tho' expre&s;ly contrary to his own rule of a literal inter|pretation; and that was to per&s;wade the world, that this &s;ociety was erected chiefly for propagating the Go&s;pel among the Indians. To this purpo&s;e he has conveniently contrived two objects of this in&s;titu|tion, the one <Q>primary and immediate (the Kings &s;ubjects) the other the grand ultimate object which is the Indians bordering on the colonies.</Q> But becau&s;e the expre&s;s words of the charter, which he had repre&s;ented as the &s;ole rule of their conduct, unluckily make no mention of "this grand ulti|mate de&s;ign", therefore he found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of departing from the rule him&s;elf had contrived, in order to adapt one of greater latitude. Indeed the Dr. a&s;&s;ures us that this phra&s;e <HI>"the pro|pagation of the go&s;pel in tho&s;e parts,"</HI> nece&s;&s;arily "includes the grand ultimate de&s;ign" before men|tioned "of chri&s;tianizing the Indians." But pray Dr. why &s;o? Is not the de&s;ign of that phra&s;e <HI>the propagation of the go&s;pel</HI> fully an&s;wer'd, by preach|ing it to tho&s;e of the King's &s;ubjects who &s;eem to be abandon'd to athei&s;m and infidelity, and to tho&s;e other "inferior &s;ubjects the &s;laves"? many of whom even in New-England are yet in a &s;tate of Heathe|ni&s;m. Does not the royal Grantor &s;ay expre&s;ly, "we think it our duty to promote the glory of God, by the in&s;truction of <HI>our people</HI> in the chri&s;tian
<PB N="22" REF="009360_0025_103211DA94D36FA8">religion?" Is there a &s;ingle word about the heathen bordering on our colonies? Why will he then force upon us a de&s;ign which the charter does not mention?</P>
<P>What is here &s;aid is not intended to prove that the Society have not a power by their charter to propagate the Go&s;pel among the heathen, for they really have &s;uch a power, and have accordingly made u&s;e of it, whenever opportunity has offer'd to do it with &s;ucce&s;s; and will continue to do &s;o notwith|&s;tanding his endeavours to mi&s;repre&s;ent, and le&s;&s;en the merit of their pious labours. But the author's intention is to &s;how the Dr. the &s;ophi&s;try of his argument, and that the rule he lays down for inter|preting the charter, would, if admitted, exclude the Society from this good work, and con&s;equently that his argument by proving too much, proves nothing at all.</P>
<P>The truth is, the Society have by their charter, not only a legal power of propagating the Go&s;pel among &s;uch of the King's &s;ubjects as are in danger of lo&s;ing their chri&s;tianity thro' athei&s;m or infidelity, and among the heathen who have not &s;o much as heard of the name of Chri&s;t: But (as mini&s;tring greatly to the&s;e purpo&s;es) of &s;upporting the means of religion among tho&s;e who have already, or who incline to receive it according to the legal e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and provi&s;ion of the church of England. In &s;hort whatever legal means are found nece&s;&s;ary or conducive to &s;ecure or propagate the profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tian religion as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, and all other his Maje&s;ty's dominions (Scotland excepted) and made a part of the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h <HI>nation;</HI> the Society have a right by their charter to make u&s;e of, under&s;tood in that generous view, ori|ginally de&s;igned and intended by the Grantor.</P>

But to this the Dr. further objects, that the Grantor <Q>King William him&s;elf was bred up in the calvini&s;tic principles and di&s;cipline, quite oppo|&s;ite in &s;ome re&s;pects to the epi&s;copal, and is gene|rally &s;uppos'd to have retain'd a regard for the principles of his education all along; tho' as King of England and head of that church, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of his <HI>externally conforming</HI> to its rites and di&s;cipline</Q>&mdash;The reader is de&s;ired to &s;top here for a moment, and indulge his a&s;toni&s;hment. Was this glorious deliverer then a fini&s;h'd hypocrite? Was he under a nece&s;&s;ity of acting contrary to his con&s;cience? of conforming externally to the church of England while his heart was not in all this? What blacker picture could he have drawn of tho&s;e whom he calls "the infamous race of the Stewarts"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Than. Serm. 1758 p. 48.</NOTE> than he has here given of this excellent prince? A Prince for whom he pretends a re&s;pect, at lea&s;t as much re&s;pect as he is capable of paying to any crowned head: For he a&s;&s;ures us in a very &s;olemn manner, that <Q>the greate&s;t part of mankind now are, and almo&s;t always have been oppre&s;&s;ed by wicked tyrants, called civil rulers, Kings and Emperors <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

And this &s;uppo&s;itious reflection upon King William was introduced it &s;eems to prove that he could not look upon the mini&s;try in the church of England as orthodox, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hment. But he might have &s;ound a better argument to prove that he could and did look upon it in that light; for certainly better evidence could not be given of his regard for the church of England, and his de&s;ire to &s;ee it take
<PB N="24" REF="009360_0027_103211DE219CA510">place and flouri&s;h in New-England, than his giving a hundred pounds &s;terling per annum out of the privy pur&s;e for &s;upporting a mini&s;ter of the church of England in Bo&s;ton, and his be&s;towing a valuable library of books on King's chapel in that town; to which (tho' not immediately relative to N. Eng|land) gratitude will oblige all true &s;ons of the church of England in America to add, his royal foundation of a college at William&s;burg in Virginia for the &s;ame noble purpo&s;e. If the King him&s;elf could &s;o liberally part with his own money to &s;up|port what the Dr. calls the <HI>peculiarities of epi&s;copacy;</HI> it can hardly be doubted but that he would readily encourage the charity of others in doing the like. So that it is not quite &s;o "unnatural" as the Dr. ima|gines <Q>to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>that</HI> noble &s;pirited Prince had &s;uch an intention.</Q> Indeed it would be unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, viz. that in making a grant in favor of a corporation of the church of England, he &s;hould make u&s;e of a word in &s;ome peculiar &s;en&s;e of his own, and different form that in which he knew they had been accu&s;tom'd to under&s;tand it. It may therefore very rea&s;onably be admitted that by ortho|dox mini&s;ters in this charter, the Grantor did <Q>intend tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h church, <HI>not</HI> in di&s;tinction from all other churches in the world,</Q> but in di&s;tinction from all tho&s;e churches in the Engli&s;h dominions, (Scotland excepted) who di&s;&s;ent from the legal con|&s;titutional e&s;tabli&s;hment of England.</P>
<P>As pertinent to what has been here &s;aid, the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age is in&s;erted, with which Dr. Humphries worthily concludes his hi&s;tory of the Society. <Q>In gratitude to the memory of the founder of this Society King William the third, it may not be improper to conclude this treati&s;e with remarking
<PB N="25" REF="009360_0028_103211DFA4AA4AA0">to the reader, the erecting of this corporation, was among the la&s;t public actions of his heroic life. After having re&s;cued the prote&s;tant religion in Europe, and &s;aved the church of England here, he did by this la&s;t act, as it were bequeath it to his American &s;ubjects, as the mo&s;t valuable legacy, and greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</Q> But the Dr. adds&mdash; <Q>to &s;ay that the Grantees under&s;tood the term orthodox in this narrow exclu&s;ive &s;en&s;e, is to reflect upon their under&s;tandings.</Q> As to their under&s;tandings, it would become him to &s;peak with reverence of them, as what he is not qualified to take the mea&s;ure of: Nor is it any reflection upon them, that they &s;hould under&s;tand the term <HI>orthodox</HI> in &s;uch a limited &s;en&s;e. For as the words orthodox and heterodox do in their literal &s;ignification import, the one a right, and the other a wrong or different opinion, in mat|ters relative to religion, &s;o, they who adhere to the legal e&s;tabli&s;hed provi&s;ion, are u&s;ually termed orthodox, or per&s;ons who hold a right opinion, and they who di&s;&s;ent from &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment are &s;aid to be heterodox, that is, per&s;ons who hold a wrong or different opinion, whether their di&s;&s;ent ari&s;es from doctrinal points, or ritual injuctions. Nor had the Dr. any occa&s;ion to wonder that his antagoni&s;t &s;hould under&s;tand the word <HI>orthodox</HI> as well capable of the &s;en&s;e he had put upon it, &s;ince it is u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in the hi&s;torical account of the So|ciety as quoted by him&s;elf.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">. 104.</NOTE> With as little rea&s;on does he charge that gentleman with not di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between <HI>here&s;y</HI> and <HI>&s;chi&s;m,</HI> for he was not talk|ing of here&s;y, but of heterodoxy, between which it &s;eems this learned critic knows no difference.</P>

AND this &s;eems to be a proper place to take notice of another mi&s;take that both the Dr. and his voucher have gone into, relative to e&s;tabli&s;hments. The Dr. does not indeed &s;eem quite &s;o clear as his voucher, that congregationali&s;m or independency are e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in New-England; yet he has &s;aid enough to &s;hew his inclination that the reader &s;hould believe it. Thus in his 16th page he calls the mini&s;ters and churches of New-England, the "e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ters and churches;" and a notable proof of their e&s;tabli&s;hment he gives us at the 42d page, where he &s;ays, that the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay made a law for the &s;upport of a learned and orthodox mini&s;try, and this the Dr. calls a "civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of reli|gion." I &s;uppo&s;e the government will &s;carcely thank Him for this interpretation of that law, which really is charging them with invading the King's pre|rogative and e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves: No &s;ays the Dr. in the next page, for the <Q>acts which relate to the &s;ettlement and &s;upport of the go&s;pel mini&s;try here, received the royal &s;anction, and therefore our churches <HI>&s;eem</HI> to have a proper legal e&s;tabli&s;hment.</Q> I believe if the Dr. held an e&s;tate upon a title &s;o pre|carious, as that of its being merely overlook'd, he would be &s;olicitous of obtaining a better confirma|tion of it. Indeed he is &s;o mode&s;t as only to a&s;&s;ert that "they <HI>&s;eem</HI> to have a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment;" but &s;ince he knew that this was no e&s;tabli&s;hment at all; it was perhaps not quite ingenuous to tell his rea|ders that it <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to be one.</P>
<P>IN his 72d page he a&s;&s;erts, that the Church of England "is not e&s;tabli&s;hed here," which appears to be introduced as another rea&s;on why the New-Eng|land churches are e&s;tabli&s;hed. But now if it &s;hould appear, that the church of England really is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lords Ju&s;tices being informed from &s;uch good hands, as make the truth of this advice not to be doubted, that at a general convention of mini|&s;ters, from &s;everal parts of his Maje&s;ty's province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, at Bo&s;ton, on the 27th of May la&s;t, a memorial and addre&s;s was framed, di|rected to you as Lieut. Governor and commander in chief, and to the council and hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives then &s;etting, de&s;iring that the general a&s;&s;em|bly would call the &s;everal churches in this province to meet by their pa&s;tors, and me&s;&s;engers, in a &s;ynod, which memorial and addre&s;s, being accordingly pre&s;ented by &s;ome of the &s;aid mini&s;ters, in the name, and at the de&s;ire of the &s;aid convention, was con|&s;idered in council, the 3d of June following; and there approved, but the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives put off the con&s;ideration of it to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, in which the council afterwards concurred.</P>
<P>Their Excellencies were extremely &s;urprized, that no account of &s;o extraordinary and important tran&s;action &s;hould have been tran&s;mitted by you, pur&s;uant to an article in your in&s;tructions, by which you are directed upon all occa&s;ions, to &s;end unto his Maje&s;ty, and to the commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations, a particular account of all your pro|ceedings, and the condition of affairs within your
<PB N="29" REF="009360_0032_103211E7A6A0EE68">government. <HI>As this matter doth highly concern his Maje&s;ty's royal prerogative,</HI> their Excellencies referr'd the con&s;ideration of it, to Mr. Attorney and Solicitor General, who after mature delibera|tion, and making all proper enquiries, reported, <HI>That from the charter and laws of your colony, they cannot collect that there is any regular e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a</HI> NATIONAL <HI>or provincial church there,</HI> &s;o as to warrant the holding of convocations or &s;ynods of the clergy, but if &s;uch &s;ynods might be holden, yet they take it to be clear in point of law, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;upremacy in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, being a branch of his prerogative, does take place in the plantations, and that &s;ynods cannot be held, nor is it lawful for the clergy to a&s;&s;emble as in &s;ynods, without authority from his Maje&s;ty." They conceive the above mentioned application of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters, not to you alone, as repre&s;ent|ing the King's per&s;on, <HI>but to you, and the council and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, to be a contempt of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative, as it is a public acknow|ledgment, that the power of granting what they de&s;ire, re&s;ides in the legi&s;lative body of the province, which by law is ve&s;ted only in his Maje&s;ty.</HI> And the Lieut. Governor, council and a&s;&s;embly inter|meddling therein, was an inva&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's royal authority, which it was your duty as Lieut. Governor, to have with&s;tood and rejected, and that the con&s;ent of the Lieut. Governor, the council and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, will not be &s;ufficient au|thority for the holding of &s;uch a &s;ynod.</P>
<P>Their Excellencies, upon con&s;ideration of this opinion, of the attorney and &s;olicitor general, which they have been plea&s;ed to approve, have commanded me to acquaint you with, and to ex|pre&s;s

<P>And I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that the precedent quoted in the above mentioned memorial of &s;uch a &s;ynod being held 45 years ago, falls in with the year 1680, and that the former charter, upon which the government of your province depended, was repealed by &s;cire facias in the year 1684, and the new charter was granted in the year 1691, from whence it appears, that if &s;uch &s;ynod was holden as is alledged, it happened a &s;hort time before the repealing of the old charter, but none has been &s;ince the granting the new one.</P>

<P>IT is really &s;urprizing, that after &s;uch a letter as this (of which it is &s;uppo&s;ed the Dr. could not be ignorant) he &s;hould notwith&s;tanding a&s;&s;ert that the New-England churches are e&s;tabli&s;hed.

Whether the Dr. will incline to di&s;pute this point with the Lords Ju&s;tices, and prove that the Attorney and Solicitor General did not un|der&s;tand the colony charter, as he has attempted to prove that the Society do not under&s;tand theirs, I am not able to &s;ay.

BUT perhaps the Dr. may be better &s;atisfied by an argument in his own way.&mdash;He lays it down as a rule for interpreting the charter of the Society, that <Q>nothing can be &s;uppo&s;ed the object or any part of the object of that in&s;titution, but what plainly appears to be &s;o, from the very words of the charter, even tho' it were certain that tho&s;e per|&s;ons to whom it was granted, had at the very time, &s;ome farther views and ends in obtaining it, be|&s;ides tho&s;e which are expre&s;&s;ed, or plainly implied; yet the words of the charter it&s;elf mu&s;t determine and limit the &s;en&s;e of the royal Grantor, and con&s;e|quently the legal power conferred&mdash;It was <HI>only</HI> for tho&s;e purpo&s;es that are particularly expre&s;&s;ed, not any private or &s;ecret ones, which they might po&s;&s;i|bly have had in their own minds, that they were incorporated.</Q> Let us now apply this rule to the charter granted to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. Nothing can be &s;uppo&s;ed the object or any part of the object of this con&s;titution, but what plainly appears to be &s;o from the very words of their charter, which very words mu&s;t determine and limit the &s;en&s;e of the Grantor. It was only for tho&s;e purpo&s;es that are particularly ex|pre&s;&s;ed &mdash;Let the Dr. now read and examine the pre&s;ent colony charter, bearing date 1691, and point out to us the pa&s;&s;age or pa&s;&s;ages where in expre&s;s words a power is granted of in&s;tituting an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, or to u&s;e his own words, a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion; but if nothing of this kind is to be found in it; if &s;uch a power be neither the object, nor any part of the object of the colony charter, it is more than probable that there is no &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment as the Dr. contends for exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>IF any thing further &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary to confute the pretence of the New-England

Sammary, vol. 1. p. 440, 441.</NOTE></Q> The &s;ame author ob&s;erves in ano|ther place, that <Q>by the articles of union of the two nations of Great-Britain, May 1707, the church of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed in perpetuity, in all the territories at that time to England belonging.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Do. p. 443.</NOTE></Q> I am a lo&s;s how the Dr. &s;hould overlook &s;o plain a ca&s;e as this, &s;o as to deny the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England in the&s;e colonites, and to affirm that of the New-England churches.

<P>BUT tho' it is undeniably manife&s;t that the church of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the Engli&s;h colonies by the act of union before-mentioned; yet it may not be &s;o clear, that this e&s;tabli&s;hment actually took place before that time; and altho' it is &s;ufficient to

Mr. Thomas Foxcroft, printed in the year 1745.</P>
<P><Q>THE chri&s;tian religion (&s;ays this ingenious author) as by its evidence and intrin&s;ic excellency it recommended it&s;elf to the Engli&s;h government, &s;o it became by law the religion of the Engli&s;h nation; and the church of England likewi&s;e be|came by law their national church; and when any part of the Engli&s;h nation &s;pread abroad into colonies, as they continued part of the nation, the law obliged them equally to the Church of England and to the chri&s;tian religion. And the &s;tatutes for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ervice ordi|nation and articles of this church, made and con|firm'd before and at the union of the two king|doms, &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h it alike in <HI>the dominions</HI> of England, and in the realm it &s;elf.</Q></P>
<Q><P>IN the reign of Edward VI. certain bi&s;hops and learned men by the appointment of the King, com|pos'd an order and rite of common prayer, and ad|mini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, in a book entitled, the book of common prayer, and admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, and other rites and ceremonies, after the u&s;e of the church of England. In the 3d year of his reign, an act of parliament was made (2d and 3d of Edward VI. c. 1.) entitled the penalty for not u&s;ing uniformity of &s;ervice and admini&s;tration of &s;acraments, whereby it was enact|ed&mdash;That all mini&s;ters in any pari&s;h church, or

<P>IN the &s;ixth year of his reign, this book of com|mon prayer, was by order of parliament (5th and 6th of Edward VI. c. 1.) explained and perfected, and a form of making and con&s;ecrating, Arch|bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons was added to it; and by an act of parliament (entitled, uni|formity of prayer, and admini&s;tration of &s;acraments &s;hall be u&s;ed in the church) it was enacted, that the former act &s;hould &s;tand in full force and &s;trength, for e&s;tabli&s;hing this book of common prayer, &amp;c. as it was for the former book, and that if any manner of per&s;on inhabiting within <HI>his Maje&s;ty's dominions,</HI> &s;hould willingly and witting|ly hear and be pre&s;ent at any other manner or form of common prayer, &amp;c. he &s;hould &s;uffer impri&s;onment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t year of the reign of Queen Eliza|beth a few alterations and additions were made in this book of common prayer, and by an act of parliament (1 Eliz. c. 2.) entitled there &s;hall be uniformity of prayer and admini&s;tation of &s;acra|ments, it was enacted, that all mini&s;ters in any pari&s;h church, or other place within the <HI>Queen's dominions,</HI> &s;hould be bound to &s;ay and u&s;e the cele|bration of the Lord's Supper, and admini&s;tration of each of the &s;acraments, and all the common and open prayer, in &s;uch order and form, as is men|tioned in the 5th and 6th of Edward the &s;ixth, with the&s;e alterations and additions, &amp;c. and that every per&s;on inhabiting within the <HI>Queen's Maje&s;|ty's

<P>IN the 13th year of Elizabeth, by an act of par|liament, entitled reformation of di&s;orders in the mini&s;ters of the church: The preamble of which is, that the churches of the <HI>Queen's Maje&s;ty's do|minions,</HI> may be &s;erved with pa&s;tors of &s;ound re|ligion, it was enacted that no per&s;on be admitted to any benefice with cure, except he &s;hall fir&s;t have &s;ub&s;cribed the 39 article.</P>
<P>IN the 14th year of Charles the IId the book of common prayer, &amp;c. was by the appointment of the King reviewed, and in convocation altered and added to, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and being approved and recommended by him to the parliament, was &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of that ap|pointed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and the parliament by an act (entitled an act for the uni|formity of public prayer, &amp;c.) reciting that where|as the 36th of the 39 articles, is in the&s;e words, viz. That the book of con&s;ecration of Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, and ordaining of prie&s;ts and deacons, lately &s;et forth in the time of King Edward the &s;ixth, and confirm'd at the &s;ame time by authority of parliament, doth contain all things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch con&s;ecration and ordaining, &amp;c. and there|fore who&s;oever are con&s;ecrated, or ordered accord|ing to the rites of that book, &s;ince the 2d year of the aforenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter &s;hall be con&s;ecrated, or ordered accord|ing to the &s;ame rites, we decree all &s;uch to be right|ly, orderly and lawfully con&s;ecrated and ordered, enacted that all &s;ub&s;criptions hereafter to be made

And by another paragraph in &s;aid act, it is enacted, that the before-mentioned &s;tatutes, for the uniformity of prayer and admini|&s;tration of &s;acraments, &s;hould &s;tand in full force and &s;trength to all intents and purpo&s;qdes what&s;o|ever, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing and confirming this book.</P>
<P>IN the 5th year of the reign of Queen Anne, by an act of parliament (5. A. c. 5.) intitled, an act for &s;ecuring the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was enacted that all acts of parliament then in force, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;ervation of the church of England, and the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and government thereof, &s;hould remain and be in full force for ever; and that every King and Queen &s;ucceeding to the royal government of the kingdom of Great Britain, at his or her coronation &s;hould take and &s;ub&s;cribe an oath to maintain, and pre&s;erve inviola|bly, the &s;aid &s;ettlement of the church of England, and the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and govern|ment thereof, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed within the kingdoms of England and Ireland, the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the <HI>territories thereunto belonging.</HI> And by the act of union of England and Scotland (5. A. c. 8.) this act was made an <HI>e&s;&s;ential and fundamental</HI> part of the union.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="38" REF="009360_0041_103211F90AE4F0C0">
<Q>I have now cited &s;even &s;tatutes for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the Church of England in the domi|nions.&mdash;The&s;e &s;tatutes are all now in force, and do equally e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm the Church of England, her wor&s;hip, articles and ordination, in the plantations and in England it &s;elf.</Q> The force of the argument which has been drawn from them will doubtle&s;s prove &s;atisfactory and convincing to every one who ob&s;erves, that every &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatute that has been cited refers to and confirms tho&s;e that preceeded, and by that means throw their united &s;trength upon the point here affirm'd; &s;o that if plain direct po&s;itive acts of parliament have any force in framing and confirming an e&s;tabli&s;hment, the Church of England is beyond controver&s;y e&s;tab|li&s;hed in all his Maje&s;ty's colonies and plantations, and therefore in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay and Connecticut.</P>
<P>THE author does not recollect any thing that can rea&s;onably be alledged again&s;t this conclu&s;ion, unle&s;s the pa&s;&s;age which was quoted before from the Lords Ju&s;tices letter, viz. <Q>that from the charter and laws of this colony it does not appear that there is any regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national or provincial church here,</Q> &s;hould be thought an objection. If this pa&s;&s;age &s;hould &s;eem to any one, to exclude the plantations from any e&s;tabli&s;hment at all, whether of the church or congregational denomination: It may be an&s;wered; It is not the intention of the &s;aid let|ter to a&s;&s;ert that there is no e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion at all in the plantations; but that <HI>&s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment is not to be collected from any powers granted in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter, nor con&s;equently in the laws founded upon that charter.</HI> And &s;ince no &s;pe|cial power or privilege of this kind was conferr'd by the charter, it is evident that the &s;tate of religion
<PB N="39" REF="009360_0042_103211FB6DD8D100">in re&s;pect to e&s;tabli&s;hments mu&s;t and does in fact re&s;t upon tho&s;e acts of parliament which relate to this &s;ubject, and e&s;pecially as they directly include all his Maje&s;ty's dominions; it being moreover an al|low'd maxim not only that all laws made in the plantations contrary to the laws of England are ip&s;o facto void, but al&s;o that where a ca&s;e occurs for which the laws of any colony have made no provi|&s;ion, &s;uch ca&s;e &s;hall be determin'd by the laws at home. It appears then from all the acts of parlia|ment that ever were made relative to e&s;tabli&s;hments, that there is an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of Eng|land in the plantations, and that authority allow'd and ratify'd by the reigning prince, was the proper authority to make an e&s;tabli&s;hment. <Q>The King (under God) is the &s;upreme head of the church of England, and if he had not appointed an ordinary over New-England, it would have re|mained under his own immediate eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction as &s;upreme head. But it is well known that his late Maje&s;ty, in the fir&s;t year of his reign, did impower the Bi&s;hop of London, under the great &s;eal, to exerci&s;e juri&s;diction over the clergy in the plantations, which were not in any Dioce&s;s, but remained under the immediate juri&s;diction of the King. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Letter above-mentioned, 1745.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>WE may now quit the &s;ubject of e&s;tabli&s;hments, and proceed to con&s;ider the Dr.'s fourth &s;ection, which contains &s;undry "other things tending" (as he imagines) <Q>to explain and confirm the &s;en&s;e of the charter.</Q> The fir&s;t is, <Q>the name by which this corporation is di&s;tingui&s;hed,</Q> viz. <HI>The Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel.</HI> This has been &s;po|ken to before; it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to add here,
<PB N="40" REF="009360_0043_103211FCF1D6E558">that the Society have in their conduct acted agree|ble to the import of this title, by &s;ending mi&s;&s;ion|aries into tho&s;e colonies which the Dr. allows to be proper objects of their in&s;titution, by &s;ending others to the Indian natives, and by appointing catechi&s;ts to the Negroes. In &s;hort, they have &s;o far comply'd with the import of this name or title, and with the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, that the Dr. him&s;elf is forced to confe&s;s, however unwillingly, <Q>that the Society have <HI>chiefly</HI> &s;ent their mi&s;&s;ionaries into tho&s;e Briti&s;h plantations where they were much needed, according to the true de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, and that they have thereby &s;erved the intere&s;t of religion. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. p. 51.</NOTE></Q> But then he &s;ays, <Q>they have deviated from the plan of their charter in &s;ome other re&s;pects,</Q> that is to &s;ay, they have &s;ometimes endeavoured to pre&s;erve men from falling into infidelity by providing for them the means of religion,&mdash;forgive them this wrong&mdash;Doubtle&s;s eve|ry candid per&s;on will allow that their in&s;titution admits of the pre&s;ervation as well as the exten&s;ion of the go&s;pel, and whether the one or the other be done, it mu&s;t be done agreeable to the particular profe&s;&s;ion and &s;entiments of tho&s;e who are the un|dertakers of this work. The Dr. adds, <Q>for &s;everal years, he thinks about eight or nine, after the Society was founded, they &s;ent no mi&s;&s;ionary into New-England, which may naturally be looked on <HI>(he &s;ays)</HI> as one argument that it was not origi|nally con&s;idered among tho&s;e plantations which were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand in need of their charity.</Q> But it is imagined that a better rea&s;on may be given why few or no mi&s;&s;ionaries were early &s;ent into New-England, and that is, that few or no &s;ocieties
<PB N="41" REF="009360_0044_103211FF300361C0">or congregations, appeared at that time to a&s;k their charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But afterwards frequent acce&s;&s;i|ons of people of that communion from abroad, toge|ther with the effect of reading and enquiry at home, joined with the enthu&s;ia&s;m which at times prevailed, e&s;pecially after Mr. Whitefields appearing among us, and which drove many of the more &s;erious and con|&s;iderate people into the bo&s;om of the church; the&s;e things occa&s;ioned &s;uch an increa&s;e of the church of England, that the Society found it nece&s;&s;ary, to al|low a greater proportion of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it was now earne&s;tly called for, and more apparently needed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next thing which the Dr. advances as li|miting the de&s;ign of the charter, is <Q><HI>the common &s;eal of the Society,</HI> which be&s;ides a &s;un in the up|per part of the circle, has a &s;hip within the circle under full &s;ail; on the prow of which &s;tands a clergyman with a bible in his hand which he ex|tends to a company of naked &s;avages on the &s;hore, thronging to receive the ble&s;&s;ing, ju&s;t over whom is a &s;croll implying the&s;e words <HI>come over and help us.</HI></Q> It is not ea&s;y to imagine what this proof was alledged for, &s;ince it either proves too much, or el&s;e nothing at all to his purpo&s;e. If it was de&s;ign|ed to prove that the <HI>&s;ole</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s of the Society ac|cording to their charter, was to carry the go&s;pel to the &s;avages, this would directly contradict the char|ter, which declares the <HI>primary object of their in&s;ti|tution to be the King's &s;ubjects,</HI> but if it was brought to prove that the conver&s;ion of the natives was one part of the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, this is no more than what we allow, and is agreeable to the conduct of the Society as well as their charter. Taking therefore the de&s;ign of the charter in that &s;en&s;e, in which the &s;ociety have all along under&s;tood it, and
<PB N="42" REF="009360_0045_10321200B4A1E850">agreeable to which they have practi&s;ed, applying them&s;elves both to the King's &s;ubjects and the natives, and it very well agrees with the &s;eal under con&s;ide|ration, but if applyed wholly to the natives which is the u&s;e the Dr. &s;eems to have bro't it for, in&s;read of agreeing, as he &s;ays it very well does, with the char|ter, it really is a flat contradiction to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next thing alledg'd by the Dr. in &s;ixing the &s;en&s;e of the charter, is certain anniver&s;ary &s;er|mons preached before the venerable Society, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of which he has quoted, in &s;upport of his opinion; but this like the former in&s;tance produc'd by him, either ju&s;tifies the Society, or el&s;e is nothing at all to the purpo&s;e. For does not the Dr. him|&s;elf repre&s;ent the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution to be that of pre&s;erving and propagating chri&s;tianity among the King's &s;ubjects, and extending it al&s;o to the Hea|then? And has not this been the very practice of the Society from the beginning? And what do the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons imply but certain exhortations to pur&s;ue the &s;everal objects of their in&s;titution; tho&s;e which the Dr. has quoted in&s;i&s;t chiefly upon one topic, while other &s;ermons preached upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion enlarge on &s;ome other branch of the general de&s;ign? As to the particular pa&s;&s;ages cited by the Dr, he him&s;elf allows, that they do <Q>rather coin|cide, with the ultimate, than the more immediate de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, and &s;o harmonize rather more perhaps with the &s;eal and name of the So|ciety, than with the charter.</Q> What now are we to learn from hence, but that the &s;eal and name of the &s;ociety, which a little before he had produced to explain and &s;upport his &s;en&s;e of the charter, do re|ally not harmonize with it at all, but only with the &s;ermons he has quoted. So all he had been offering
<PB N="43" REF="009360_0046_103212029948CB28">before by way of proof, from the name and &s;eal of the Society is now given up again, as being (what indeed it was) nothing to the purpo&s;e. This gentle|man has a very &s;trange method of proving and di&s;|proving, of a&s;&s;erting and giving up again. Sure he could never expect to arrive at any &s;olid conclu&s;ion, by this wanton method of arguing. The truth is, tho&s;e worthy gentlemen, who have preached the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons before the Society, have not all of them con&s;ined them&s;elves to the &s;ame topics, but as the in&s;titution of the Society comprehended &s;eve|ral objects, &s;ome have enlarged more particularly upon one object, and &s;ome upon another, as they &s;everally thought proper, but all within the general intendment and de&s;ign of their charter; and if the Dr. had intended to have drawn an argument from the&s;e annual &s;ermons, in proof of the original de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, he &s;hould have formed an ab|&s;tract from them all, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they have en|larged upon different topics, and have given us the collective &s;en&s;e of the whole. But this indeed would not have &s;erved his turn; for he him&s;elf &s;ays <Q>he is not in&s;en&s;ible, that &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ermons, e&s;|pecially within the la&s;t twenty years, have ex|pre&s;&s;ions in them of a much le&s;s catholic &s;train;</Q> that is to &s;ay, they do not &s;o well &s;uit his purpo&s;e; and in truth he has taken the liberty to treat them accordingly, that is with great indecency, as will appear to any one who con&s;ults his 13th, 14th and 15th &s;ections, as well as many other pa&s;&s;ages of his book.</P>
<P>The author has now gone thro' the Dr's repre|&s;entation of the Society's charter, together with the &s;everal arguments he has advanced, to &s;upport the &s;en&s;e he hath put upon it, and has endeavoured to
<PB N="44" REF="009360_0047_10321204758BF260">prove that they are altogether inconclu&s;ive; whether he has &s;ucceeded or not, mu&s;t be left to the judgment of the candid unprejudiced reader. In the mean time if the account which has now been given of the char|ter and in&s;titution of the Society be ju&s;t; all the Dr's accu&s;ations of that venerable body, his charges of mi&s;conduct, mi&s;application of monies, and perver&s;ion of the tru&s;t which they have taken on them&s;elves, fall to the ground; and he has only to con&s;ider what reparation he ought in con&s;cience to make, or endeavour to make, for the indecent liberties, and various abu&s;e he has been guilty of towards them.</P>
<P>Here therefore the pre&s;ent examination &s;eems to to conclude; but as there are yet many things in the Dr's book, which the author conceives to be ex|tremely exceptionable, he thinks it proper to take notice of at lea&s;t &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>It is a frequent &s;ubject of complaint with him, that the Society have not done enough towards the conver&s;ion of the Indians, tho' by their public ac|counts it appears that they have omitted nothing in their power to promote that good work; nor have they been entirely without &s;ucce&s;s. He is likewi&s;e much di&s;plea&s;ed, that more mi&s;&s;ionaries have not been &s;ent to tho&s;e colonies, who&s;e religious &s;tate he thinks to be but little removed from heatheni&s;m. What colonies he here refers to, we can be at no lo&s;s about, &s;ince he excepts none but tho&s;e of Con|necticut and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. He allows for in&s;tance that the Society might have &s;upported mi&s;|&s;ions in the colony of Rhode-I&s;land with propriety enough; and indeed they have done &s;o, and po&s;&s;i|bly might have done more than they have, if they had not met with too much oppo&s;ition from a party &s;pirit. For in&s;tance, The Society upon a repre&s;entation of the
<PB N="45" REF="009360_0048_1032120656A13E50">great nece&s;&s;ity of a mi&s;&s;ionary in the Narragan&s;et, parti|cularly in South and North King&s;ton, at a time when there was no &s;ettled mini&s;ter of any denomination; &s;ent thither Mr. Guy, Mr. Bridge, and afterwards Dr. Mac&s;parran to officiate among them. To give a check to the&s;e gentlemens &s;ucce&s;s, and le&s;t the in|habitants &s;hould receive religion, as it is taught in the church of England; one Mr. Torrey was di&s;|patched thither, who had &s;o little preten&s;ions, and &s;o few adherents, that he could not find five per&s;ons to give him a call (which I think the platform requires) and yet is officiou&s;ly continued there to this day, tho' his congregation, as I am informed by tho&s;e who live in the neighbourhood, u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ts of &s;carce twenty people.</P>
<P>Again, The Society open'd a mi&s;&s;ion at Provi|dence about the year 1722 or 1723, where at that time there was no &s;ettled mini&s;ter of the congre|gational per&s;ua&s;ion. But for fear tho&s;e people &s;hould receive the benefit of religion agreeable to the church of England, a congregational mini&s;ter was &s;oon &s;ent thither, and as it is &s;aid, even forc'd upon the people, who refu&s;ed to pay any thing towards his &s;upport.</P>
<P>Once more at Charle&s;town in the Narragan&s;et, an attempt was made by &s;everal church families in that town, to e&s;tabli&s;h a mi&s;&s;ion for the benefit of them&s;elves, and the tribe of Indians in that neigh|bourhood (at that time about 400) to which attempt the Indians were &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, by the labours of Dr. Mac&s;parran a neighbouring mi&s;&s;ionary, that the Sachem gave a piece of ground to erect a church upon, and a con&s;iderable quantity of land be&s;ides, as a glebe for a mi&s;&s;ionary.

<P>The Dr's fifth &s;ection contains his account of the &s;tate of religion in N. England, before and &s;ince the the incorporation of the Society. But this account in many things, can by no means be approved.</P>

Yet becau&s;e this &s;tale pretence concerning the de&s;ign of the fir&s;t adventurers as to religious matters is artfully and in|du&s;triou&s;ly propagated among the common people who have not &s;ufficient opportunities of examining this matter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give it a more particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Dr. Dougla&s;s acquaints us that <Q>Robert Brown, a hot-headed young enthu&s;ia&s;tical clergyman, began anno 1580, to preach again&s;t the ceremonies and di&s;cipline of the church of England; he was per|&s;eacuted or baited and teazed by the bi&s;hops courts, he with &s;ome di&s;ciples left England, and formed a church at Middleborough of Zealand in the Dutch low countries; after &s;ome time this effer|ve&s;cence or cbulition of youth &s;ub&s;ided, he re|turned to England, recanted, and had a church of England cure be&s;towed upon him, and died in that communion, anno 1630.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A congregation of the&s;e Browni&s;ts was form|in Yarmouth 1602, being harra&s;s'd by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church of England, with their pa&s;tor they tran&s;ported them&s;elves to Leyden in Holland; here they became more moderate under the di|rection of their pa&s;tor Mr. Robin&s;on; and from Browni&s;ts changed their denomination to that of Independents: Being of un&s;teady temper, they re&s;olved to remove from among&s;t &s;trangers after
<PB N="49" REF="009360_0052_1032120DE3C764B0">ten years re&s;idence, to &s;ome remote country in &s;ome wilderne&s;s, where without mole&s;tation they might wor&s;hip God in their own devotional way. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sum.

<P>Thus the fir&s;t effectual &s;ettlement in N. England was clearly made upon a religious account: But as to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, under&s;tood as po&s;terior to, and di&s;tinct from that of Plymouth, they plainly acted as other men u&s;ually do upon like occa&s;ions, from hopes of in|crea&s;ing their e&s;tates, and providing an ample inhe|ritance for their children. Having for the&s;e pur|po&s;es negotiated a &s;ettlement for &s;ome time, by a Governor and Company re&s;iding in England, they at length thought it mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of the pro|priety, that the &s;eat of government &s;hould be re|moved to the country they were &s;ettling. Accord|ingly Mr. Winthrop was cho&s;en Governor, and he with his a&s;&s;ociates embark'd on board &s;undry &s;hips, of which the Arabella was admiral, with a de&s;ign to proceed to America.</P>
<P>As it was now pretty generally known, that the Plymouth adventurers had &s;et up a way of wor&s;hip different from the public e&s;tabli&s;hment of the nation, it began to be &s;u&s;pected and reported, that this new

This came to the cars of Governor Winthrop and his a&s;&s;ociates, while they lay wind-bound at Yarmouth, and it gave them great unea&s;ine&s;s, as well it might, to lie under the odium of this &s;lander, and occa&s;ioned their writing the following letter for their own exculpation be|fore they put to &s;ea, viz.</P>

<P>Previous to any application of the foregoing let|ter it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Prince in his chronology gives te&s;timony that the&s;e <HI>pious peo|ple were profe&s;&s;ed members of the church of England.</HI> <Q>For the information (&s;ays he) of the pre&s;ent age as well as po&s;terity, they (this colony of pious people) were of a denomination &s;omewhat diffe|rent in tho&s;e early times from them of Plymouth&mdash;they were 'till now,</Q> (that is, after their arrival in N. England) <Q>profe&s;&s;ed members of the church of England. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince's chronol. p. 313.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>From the foregoing letter and te&s;timony it is evi|dent, that whatever the ca&s;e was at other places, and with regard to other adventurers, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay at lea&s;t, tho&s;e pious good men, who left <Q>the fair cities, villages, and delightful fields of Britain, for the then inho&s;pitable &s;hores,
<PB N="52" REF="009360_0055_10321213B2A36100">and de&s;arts of America</Q> did not do it from any di&s;gu&s;t they had taken at the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of their country; but from quite other motives.&mdash;They po&s;itively declare their veneration for the e&s;tab|li&s;hed church, that they <HI>e&s;teem it their honour to call her their dear mother,</HI> that they <HI>cannot part from the place of her &s;pecial re&s;idence without much &s;adne&s;s of heart, and many tears in their eyes,</HI> they acknowledge that <HI>the hope they have obtained in the common &s;alva|tion, they received in her bo&s;om, and &s;uck'd from her brea&s;ts.</HI> They declare <HI>they do not loath the milk with which they have been</HI> thus <HI>nouri&s;hed, but ble&s;s God for this their parentage and education,</HI> that <HI>their in|tentions have been mi&s;reported;</HI> that <HI>while they have breath, they will</HI> SINCERELY <HI>endeavour the conti|nuance and abundance of her welfare, with</HI> THE ENLARGEMENT OF HER BOUNDS, <HI>in the kingdom of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;uch an explicit declaration as this, written and &s;igned with their own hands, how can the Dr. pretend that the&s;e men were aggrieved at home, that they <Q>came hither chiefly on account of their &s;uf|ferings for non-conformity,</Q> that <Q>they fled hi|hither as to an a&s;&s;ylum from epi&s;copal per&s;ecuti|on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obs. p. 39.</NOTE>?</Q> Is the foregoing the language of the per|&s;eacuted, of men &s;uffering for con&s;cience &s;ake? In an hone&s;t and &s;erious view, what foundation had he for calling upon people to <Q>reflect on what their fore-fathers &s;uffered from the mitred lordly &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of the fi&s;hermen of Galilee?</Q> What truth in &s;aying that this <Q>occa&s;ioned their flight into this we&s;tern world"? Did our pious fore-fathers throw them&s;elves into the arms of Savages and Barbarians, to be delivered from the unholy zeal
<PB N="53" REF="009360_0056_10321215922FBF18">and oppre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e lordly men, countenanc'd by &s;cepter'd tyrants?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obs. p. 155.</NOTE></Q> And would they at the &s;ame time earne&s;tly a&s;k the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and prayers of the&s;e lordly oppre&s;&s;ors, and openly acknowledge the &s;piritual benefits they had received from them? Read my dear countrymen, read the words of our pious fore-fathers, in the above letter, and compare them, with this author's licentious harangue, and pretended vindication of them, and &s;ee with your own eyes whether the &s;pirit of the one and the other have the lea&s;t &s;imilitude. In &s;hort either the&s;e pious good men, were hone&s;tly attach'd to the church of Eng|land, and &s;erious members of her communion, or they were not; the Dr. affirms they were di&s;&s;en|ters, they them&s;elves declare, that they were faithful &s;ons and children of the church, <HI>educated in her bo|&s;om, nouri&s;h'd at her brea&s;ts, ble&s;&s;ing God for this their education, promi&s;ing to &s;eek her welfare, with the enlargement of her bounds:</HI> From hence then one of the&s;e two things mu&s;t unavoidably follow; either that they were dreadful prevaricators with God and man, or el&s;e that they are &s;adly abu&s;ed and &s;lan|dered, when contrary to their own expre&s;s declara|tion they are &s;aid to have been di&s;&s;enters, driven hi|ther by the oppre&s;&s;ions and per&s;ecution of the church of England. If the former was the ca&s;e, let us no more boa&s;t of them as pious good men; If the lat|ter, let the Dr. con&s;ider, what recompence he can make to the memory of the&s;e men, for abu&s;ing them with the opprobious charge of &s;ectari&s;m and hypo|cri&s;y.</P>
<P>And this &s;eems to be a proper place to take no|tice of a reflection which the Dr. very liberally be|&s;tows upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England, which
<PB N="54" REF="009360_0057_10320CE1602493A0">he calls "a cruel per&s;ecuting church"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obs. p 40</NOTE> and &s;ays <Q>the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the country were per&s;eacuted out of England by the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">p 46.</NOTE></Q> And again, <Q>is it not enough (&s;ays he) that they per&s;eacuted us out of the old world? will they pur|&s;ue us into the new?<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p 156.</NOTE></Q> And a few lines after he &s;peaks of the danger of being <Q>con&s;umed by the flames, or deluged in a flood of epi&s;copacy.</Q> A &s;tranger would perhaps be led by this manner of expre&s;&s;ion to conceive, that not only fire and faggot were plentifully employed in England for extirpating di&s;&s;enters, but al&s;o that the Dutch method of knuting was u&s;ed towards them for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. The&s;e that have been mentioned are but a few, out of ma|ny, very many bitter terms he has thought proper to be&s;tow upon a prote&s;tant church, univer&s;ally ve|nerated abroad, and generally e&s;teemed the bulwark and glory of the reformation; a church remarkable for its tenderne&s;s, and kind reception of foreign pro|te&s;tants, when the&s;e have been obliged to fly from their native countries on account of real per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry the Dr. has made it nece&s;&s;ary to enter upon a &s;ubject &s;o invidious as this, and which lies &s;o open to abundant recrimination. The author is unwilling to renew the memory of tho&s;e &s;everities, that were too commonly practiced by all parties in the la&s;t century, and which &s;eem rather owing to the temper of the age, and the mi&s;taken maxims of policy then prevailing, than to have been the con|&s;equence of religious principles. The church of England, con&s;idered as &s;uch, has nothing in its con|&s;titution, that either nece&s;&s;icates or warrants a per|&s;ecuting temper; and if any improper &s;everities have at any time been u&s;ed by the government, in &s;up|porting

<P>WHATEVER may be the temper of particular men, it is pretty certain that at this time of day, all parties di&s;claim tho&s;e &s;everities which have formerly been too much indulged; the people of New-Eng|land in particular, have &s;pecial rea&s;on to be careful how they countenance tho&s;e who would promote &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition (to which &s;ome may think the Dr's manner of writing upon this occa&s;ion has no &s;mall tendency) le&s;t the &s;ame effect &s;hould re&s;ult from it, which has once been the con&s;equence of &s;uch a conduct in the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; per&s;ecution of their fellow chri&s;tians having been one principal article which occa&s;ioned the va|cating their former charter.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sum. hi&s;t. &amp; pol. vol.

<P>Dr. Dougla&s;s tells us in his Summary, that <Q>by an ancient law of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts province, none were allowed to be freemen but tho&s;e who were church members, that is (&s;ays he) of the indepen|dent or congregational religious mode; and that only freemen were capable of voting in civil a&s;|&s;emblies.</Q> Upon which he remarks. <Q>This was

<P>THE Dr. could not be ignorant that epi&s;copal go|vernment generally obtained thro' all ages of the chri&s;tian church; that it takes place at this day in al|mo&s;t all the chri&s;tian world; that the prote&s;tant churches abroad, who are not &s;o happy as to live un|der this form of church government, do yet expre&s;s the highe&s;t reverence and e&s;teem of it; it would therefore doubtle&s;s have been more becoming to have expre&s;s'd his di&s;like in terms of greater mode&s;ty than he has u&s;ually done in this and many other of his writings, of an order &s;o generally held in vene|ration. Even the admired Calvin and Beza have highly applauded the epi&s;copal hierarchy of England, as appears by their letter to Queen Elizabeth, the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and others. They pray heartily to God for the continuance and pre&s;ervation of it, bewail their own unhappine&s;s in the want of it, and mention it as their unavoidable misfortune to be without it. As to Calvin, altho' he ju&s;tly ob|jects to that univer&s;al &s;upremacy claimed by the &s;ee of Rome, as u&s;urping the prerogative of Chri&s;t, he would not believe that any man could oppo&s;e the epi&s;copal hierarchy; but (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of the Romi&s;h church) <Q>If they would &s;hew us &s;uch an hierarchy, in which the Bi&s;hops might &s;o pre&s;ide, as not to refu&s;e &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, but depend upon him as their only head, and refer them&s;elves to him, then truly I will confe&s;s that they de|&s;erve to be anathematized, if any &s;uch men &s;hall be, who refu&s;e to reverence it, and &s;ubmit to it

<P>NOR is it the venerable order of Bi&s;hops only, which this writer has treated with &s;uch unbecoming freedom.

THIS, &s;o far as it is an argument has been urged by him, oftentimes before, and implies that he thinks the Society, have no right by their charter to &s;up|port a public religion in New-England, e&s;pecially to the neglect of the Indians and the &s;outhern <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> governments; for if they have a right to &s;upport re|ligion in New-England at all, he allows it is natural to expect they &s;hould do it in their own way, and according to their own &s;entiments.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erva. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> To this it has already been replied, that New-England containing a great many negro &s;laves that are &s;till heathen, a great many freethinkers and other mi&s;believers, be|&s;ides a great number of people from Europe educated in, and &s;eriou&s;ly attach'd to the Church of England, is directly in the mo&s;t literal &s;en&s;e, one object of the Society's charity agreeable to their charter.

THE author has now gone thro' every thing in the Dr's book which he looks upon to be material, i. e. which relates to the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, or prin|cipal argument of it. If any thing has inadvertently e&s;caped him, which the Dr. thinks to be of con&s;e|quence to his main argument, upon proper notice of it, he will readily wait upon him agin. There are indeed &s;undry incidental reflections to be met with, but as they are foreign to the general argu|ment, and e&s;pecially as they have been honour'd with &s;ome proper remarks in a pamphlet lately pub|li&s;hed at Port&s;mouth in New-Hamp&s;hire, the author does not at pre&s;ent think it worth his while to take notice of them.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the argument on both &s;ides&mdash;The Dr's book is entitled <Q>Ob&s;ervations on the charter and conduct of the Society, &amp;c. de&s;igned to &s;hew their nonconformity to each other.</Q> In pro&s;ecut|ing this de&s;ign the Dr. has given us his, or rather Mr. Hobart's &s;en&s;e of the charter; this &s;en&s;e he has endeavoured to &s;upport, by adducing the title and &s;eal, and &s;undry &s;ermons of the Society in con&s;ima|tion of it. After which, comparing the conduct of the Society with the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, as he has plann'd it, he &s;inds them to be incon&s;i&s;tent, or to di&s;agree with with each other. This is a &s;hort (and it is &s;uppo&s;ed) a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the Dr's management of the pre&s;ent argument, which if he had pur&s;ued in a mode&s;t manner, without &s;currility or abu&s;e, no body would have blamed him? he would have been intitled to a mode&s;t and genteel reply. Whether he has ob&s;erved this method, let the unprejudiced reader judge.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent reply is intended to &s;hew that the conduct of the Society is not incon&s;i&s;tent with their charter, nor yet with the title or &s;eal, or the anni|ver&s;ary
<PB N="65" REF="009360_0068_1032122AFB142D10">&s;ermons preached before them. To prove this the author has endeavoured to &s;hew, Fir&s;t, That the Society have always had &s;uch means of infor|mation, both in re&s;pect to the true meaning of their charter, and al&s;o in regard to the &s;tate of religion in the plantations, that it is morally certain they could not have been deceived in regard to the&s;e points. 2dly. The members of which that Society is compo&s;ed, are in general per&s;ons of &s;o re&s;pectable a character, that it is utterly improbable they would act contrary to their in&s;titution with de&s;ign; and further that if they were inclined to do &s;o, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;ucceeded in &s;o iniqui|tous a purpo&s;e, becau&s;e their charter obliges them annually to &s;ubmit their whole tran&s;actions, to the examination of the Lord chancellor and chief ju&s;tices of the King's bench and common pleas, who are purpo&s;ely appointed by the Crown to &s;ee that the true intent and meaning of the grant be complied with. 3dly, The author has examined the charter it&s;elf, and compared the &s;ame with the actual con|duct of the Society, and finds that they have pur|&s;ued the &s;everal objects therein recommended, agree|able to their title and &s;eal, and to the general purport of their annual &s;ermons.</P>
<P>In examining the charter he thinks it appears, that the Dr's interpretation of it cannot be ju&s;t, inas|much as it renders it incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; &s;o al&s;o his explanation of the &s;eal and title of the Society militates with his interpretation of the charter, and &s;erves to prove his mi&s;takes as to both. His quo|tations from the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons of the Society, as they relate to one object only of their in&s;titution, mu&s;t be look'd upon as a partial repre&s;entation, how|ever they do not at all interfere with what is allow|ed
<PB N="66" REF="009360_0069_1032122CDF762748">to be the &s;en&s;e of the charter, or with their ge|neral conduct, and con&s;equently are nothing at all to the purpo&s;e for which they were introduced.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the author has made a few ca&s;ual &s;trictures upon &s;ome of the Dr's incidental reflecti|ons, as they happened to fall in the way of the principal argument; and he was the rather inclined to do this, becau&s;e the Dr's quarrel with the So|ciety, &s;eems really to take its ri&s;e, not &s;o much from any thing he &s;aw ami&s;s in their conduct, as from his inveterate hatred, and unrea&s;onable di&s;plea&s;ure towards the church of England, which he &s;latters him&s;elf could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in the country with|out the Society's countenance and &s;upport. And yet in this perhaps he is mi&s;taken, &s;ince the pro|vidence of God has more ways than one of &s;up|porting his own cau&s;e; &s;o that if the Society &s;hould think fit to withdraw their a&s;&s;i&s;tance (which they will hardly do the &s;ooner for &s;uch ob&s;ervations as his) it is not doubted but that God would rai&s;e up other helps, or &s;ome way direct to &s;ufficient means for the pre&s;ervation of his church. It was the ad|vice of a wi&s;er man than perhaps cither of us, to the jewi&s;h council, when they were con&s;ulting how they &s;hould put a &s;top to the preaching of the apo&s;tles, and the early propagation of the go&s;pel; <Q>Refrain from the&s;e men, and let them alone: for if this council, or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye can|not overthrow it; le&s;t haply ye be found even to fight again&s;t God.</Q></P>
<P>If the Society, either through mi&s;repre&s;entation, or by any other means, have been led into any mi&s;take in the management of any part of their tru&s;t, no man will think that the Dr's indecent and
<PB N="67" REF="009360_0070_1032122F24BAADF0">abu&s;ive treatment of them is the way to incline them to amend it. Had it not been better to have improved upon the hint which he has quoted from bi&s;hop Burnet, and by this means have excited their emulation? or as the bi&s;hop expre&s;&s;es it "have pro|voked them to jealou&s;ly"? Mr. Hobart referring to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age mentions &s;ome great things that have been done in regard to the conver&s;ion of the Indians by the Society in Scotland for propagating chri&s;tian knowledge, (it is &s;uppo&s;ed by the care and management of their commi&s;&s;ioners at Bo&s;ton) with a &s;mall expence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hobart's I&s;t Addre&s;s p. 129.</NOTE> Suppo&s;ing the truth of this, (which the author has no inclination to call in que&s;tion) every good chri&s;tian will &s;incerely rejoice at it, and pray God that they may &s;till meet with more abundant &s;ucce&s;s. But then would it not have been infinitely more u&s;eful, and have di&s;covered more of a chri&s;tian &s;pirit, if the Dr. in&s;tead of abu|&s;ing the Society for the propagation of the go&s;pel, had employed him&s;elf in giving a particular account of that other Society which has been thus remarka|bly &s;ucce&s;sful, e. g. What has been their certain fund, what their ca&s;ual benefactions, from whom they receive their money, and how it is expended, what mi&s;&s;ionaries they employ, at what places they are fixt, and what are their re&s;pective &s;alaries, and la&s;tly, what accounts have been received from them as to the fruit of their labours: Had he done this, in &s;ome &s;uch plain open and hone&s;t method as the Society for propa|gating the go&s;pel have done, it might po&s;&s;ibly not only have provoked them to emulation, but have opened to them &s;ome new or more effectual methods for rendring their pious de&s;igns &s;ucce&s;sful.

<HEAD>A &s;hort Vindication of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> again&s;t the Objections, Mi&s;takes and Mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of Dr. MAYHEW, in his Ob&s;erva|tions, on the Conduct of that Society. By one of its Members. In a LETTER to a FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great difficulty I labour under in writing, mu&s;t be my apology for writing very briefly, and attending only to the mo&s;t material things.</P>
<P>It is too evident from the general current of Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s performance, That, it is his aim to beget a pre|judice, and an odium in his readers, again&s;t his antageni&s;t, and again&s;t the church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Society, from con&s;iderations and reflections, either meerly per&s;onal, or lu|dicrous, and often trifling, and few of them, relating to the real merits of the cau&s;e; which is a practice quite unbe|coming a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> writer, either in the critical, or moral &s;en&s;e of that character.</P>
<P>There is one grand impo&s;ition upon his readers, which runs through the whole, and is, as it were, the burthen of his &s;ong, in which, there is not the lea&s;t truth, and for which, there never was the lea&s;t ground, or foundation, as ever I could learn, viz. That the chief view and endeavour of the Society has been to convert presbyterians and congregationa|li&s;ts to the church, to the neglect of Negroes and Indians, and the <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> colonies, as he calls them.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="009360_0085_1032124D0C80FD20">
If they, or their mi&s;&s;ionaries had done this, they would have had infinitely more rea&s;on, and right in what they did, than the di&s;&s;enters from the beginning had, in u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible endeavours, to promote factions, and di&s;affect people, to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of <HI>England,</HI> in all quarters, and make all the pro&s;elytes they could, from her commanion, to their confu&s;ed parties and &s;ects, i&s;&s;uing in downright rebellion: So that this, is alledged with a very ill grace, by one, derived from, and who is a violent abettor of that party.</P>
<P>It is true, every good churchman mu&s;t rejoice, when any of our wandering brethren, who have been drawn away, from the bo&s;om and communion of the church, or educated in prejudice again&s;t it, are reclaimed, and return to the unity of the church, and be glad to be in&s;trumental, as God in his providence gives them opportunity, in recon|ciling any of them: But, as the Society was not incorpo|rated for that purpo&s;e, nor was it ever their principal aim. I believe very few in&s;tances, if any, can be produced, of any mi&s;&s;ionaries beginning with any di&s;&s;enter, with a view at reclaiming him to the church. I have been long know|ing to the affairs of the Society, and know of no &s;uch in&s;tances.</P>
<P>We have indeed been treated bith great obloquy by di&s;|&s;entors repre&s;enting us, as little better than roman catholics, &amp;c. On the&s;e occa&s;ions we have defended our&s;elves, as well as we could: and can any body blame us for it? And can any rea&s;onable per&s;on wonder if this &s;hould &s;ometimes prove the occa&s;ion of the conver&s;ion of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible hone&s;t peo|ple? Or if the meer curio&s;ity of others attending occa&s;io|nally on our beautiful and in&s;tructive &s;ervice, &s;hould be the means of their being reconciled, when they &s;ee, that it does not con&s;i&s;t of extempore human invention, but is a wi&s;e and judicious collection from the holy &s;criptures? &s;o that, their very love to the &s;criptures, has &s;ometimes led them to love the &s;ervice of the church.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, That Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> the father of the Society, reported, that in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> there was no occa&s;ion for the Society to do any thing, as they were provided for, in the di&s;&s;enting way:&mdash;I an&s;wer, I knew Dr. <HI>Bray</HI> very well, he was doubtle&s;s a very good man, and I
<PB N="83" REF="009360_0086_1032124E91112BD0">agree to his report at that time, and &s;hould have made the &s;ame report my&s;elf: There was then (except at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI>) but here and there a member of the church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;catrered about in the&s;e provinces; and according to the con&s;titution of the Society, while there was no congregation of the church in tho&s;e parts, the Society had no occa&s;ion to &s;end any mi&s;&s;ionaries thither: But does it at all follow, that when there came to be &s;uch numbers of con&s;cientious members of the church of <HI>England,</HI> as to make competent congregations for wor&s;hip, being not well able to provide for a mini&s;ter them&s;elves, that the Society had by their charter, no right and bu&s;ine&s;s, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in providing for them, meerly becau&s;e the di&s;&s;enters in tho&s;e provinces were already pro|vided for? Can any rea&s;on be given, why a con&s;cientious body of church people in the&s;e provinces, &s;hould not be provided for, as well as in any other province?&mdash;You will &s;ay, let them go to meeting, I an&s;wer, many of them were &s;o candid, as to go to the meetings, rather than no where, tho' it was very tedious and di&s;agreeable to them, till they grew in numbers, &s;o as to make competent congregations.</P>
<P>Yea, but it is repre&s;ented, That the origin of the church, in the&s;e provinces, has been generally owing to faction, di&s;content with mini&s;ters, and about rates, pews, and the like, and tho' the church is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of our mother country, and in the act of union, is, (as Dr. <HI>Doug|la&s;s,</HI> his favourite author allows) e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the plan|cations; he is pleas'd in his great good manners, to &s;peak of her in the&s;e governments, under no better terms, than tho&s;e of party and faction.</P>
<P>How much truth there may be in Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s ac|count of the origin of the church, at <HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Brain-tree,</HI> I am not able to &s;ay, and that &s;ome individuals have had little better motives in conforming, than tho&s;e men|tioned, I will not deny, and perhaps &s;ome of the mi&s;&s;io|naries have not always acted prudently, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may have been in a few in&s;tances too forward; &s;uch things are common to frail human nature; however, this I know, that the general rule and practice where I am acquainted, have been, to &s;end male-contents, and per&s;ons liable to cen&s;ure, back, to make peace at home, before they came
<PB N="84" REF="009360_0087_103212509298AA78">over to us. But, &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome things a little wrong, is it fit, that &s;o re&s;pectable a body, as the Society or the church, &s;hould be reproached, with the forwardne&s;s, or mi&s;conduct, of a few individuals?</P>
<P>Let me, however, give what I know to be generally a true account, of the origin of the church in the&s;e provinces.</P>
<P>The true cau&s;es, and occa&s;ions, of the being and growth of &s;o many congregations of the church of <HI>England,</HI> in the&s;e provinces, are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As the country continued to increa&s;e, and there were many acce&s;&s;ions from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> there were among others, many of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, who came over to &s;ettle in the&s;e colonies, as well as others, &s;o that there was 50 years ago, &s;carce a town of con&s;iderable &s;tanding, but what had &s;ome &s;cattering among them, and in &s;ome there were &s;everal families: In <HI>Straiford,</HI> for in&s;tance, the fir&s;t in <HI>Connecticut</HI> that applied to the Society; there were at the beginning of this century about fifteen families, and five or &s;ix more in the neare&s;t towns, that joined with them; and in 1722, when the fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ion was e&s;tabli&s;hed, there were about thirty or forty; now, on &s;uppo&s;ition that the fir&s;t who &s;ettled in the&s;e provinces were di&s;&s;enters generally, yet I know no rea&s;on why the&s;e lands &s;hould be thought &s;o &s;acred to them, as to exclude the church, nor, why church people &s;hould not be at liberty, to &s;ettle them|&s;elves in the&s;e colonies, as well as in any others? And if they do, who can deny, that they have as good a right to enjoy their way of wor&s;hip as their neighbours? And if they need, and obtain any charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can any thing but envy and malevolence, make &s;uch a clamour again&s;t it? But,</P>
<P N="2">2. So the ca&s;e has been, ever &s;ince church people &s;et|tled in the&s;e countries, many di&s;&s;enters have treated them with much clamour and contempt, and frequent di&s;putings have ari&s;en, which occa&s;ioned many to procure books, wherewith to defend them&s;elves, &s;uch as arch bi&s;hop <HI>King</HI>'s inventions of men in the wor&s;hip of God, the <HI>London</HI> ca&s;es, <HI>Hoadley</HI> again&s;t <HI>Calamy,</HI> arch bi&s;hop <HI>Potter</HI> on church government, and &s;ome <HI>Hooker</HI>'s eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, and &s;uch like. And their thus defending them&s;elves, occa&s;ioned
<PB N="85" REF="009360_0088_10321252C6D21800">many inqui&s;itive candid di&s;&s;enters to read tho&s;e books, which reconciled them to the church; &s;o that the di&s;&s;enters them|&s;elves by thus cen&s;uring, and di&s;puting, have occa&s;ioned the increa&s;e of the church, and I hope it may be truly &s;aid, in a judgment of charity, many both of the original church people, and of the pro&s;elyted di&s;&s;enters have been &s;incerely con&s;cientious.&mdash;Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> indeed, and &s;ome other di&s;&s;en|ters, however differing in &s;ome things, as much, (if not more) among them&s;elves, as either of them from the church, &s;eem &s;o bigotted to their di&s;&s;enting principles, in one &s;hape or other, and &s;o full of them&s;elves, that they &s;carce know how to imagine, that church people, or any who differ from them, can be con&s;cientious; but &s;urely, any candid and indifferent per&s;ons, that know any thing of &s;uch great and good men, as <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> mu&s;t allow, that it is po&s;&s;ible, for a church man, upon the foot of <HI>Hooker's</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, and <HI>Chillingworth's</HI> demon&s;tration of epi&s;copacy, (to &s;ay nothing of arch bi&s;hop <HI>Potter</HI> and arch bi&s;hop <HI>Sharp,</HI> and the many others) to be at lea&s;t as con|&s;cientious, as any di&s;&s;enters in their way upon the foot of any of their various principles.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another thing and what has of late chiefly occa&s;ioned the acce&s;&s;ion of multitudes to the church, was, the wild en|thu&s;ia&s;m that long obtained among them&s;elves, on which oc|ca&s;ion, their own managements were in many in&s;tances, &s;o extravagant and ridiculous, as tended va&s;tly more, to drive their people into the church, than any thing we ever did to draw them over to it.&mdash; Particularly, that mon&s;trous enthu|&s;ia&s;m that was at fir&s;t mightily encouraged by them&s;elves fifteen or twenty years ago, in con&s;equence of Mr. <HI>White-field's</HI> rambling over the country, once and again, who was followed by a great many &s;trolling teachers, who propagated &s;o many wild and horrid notions of God and the go&s;pel, that a multitude of people, were &s;o bewilder'd that they could find no re&s;t to the &s;ole of their foot, till they took refuge in the church, as their only ark of &s;afety. And many of the&s;e wild notions (to &s;ay nothing now of the oppo&s;ite extreams of ariani&s;m, &s;ociniani&s;m, and independent-whiggi&s;m) continue among great numbers to this day, and have occa&s;ioned much hot contention among them in &s;ettling mini&s;ters, and often
<PB N="86" REF="009360_0089_103212544A32CF30">the pro&s;titution of di&s;cipline upon the meane&s;t trifles, which have occa&s;ioned many people to conclude, that if they mu&s;t &s;eparate from their former brethren, who are in endle&s;s con|tentions and confu&s;ion, their be&s;t way mu&s;t be to retire into the church, which is in peace.&mdash;Now, the&s;e are all known facts: Is not Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> then very di&s;ingenuous to con|ceal them, and a&s;cribe the being and increa&s;e of the church, only to petts and quarrels about pews, rates, and &s;uch tri|fling things, and to a meer &s;pirit of faction?</P>
<P>But, it is pretended, great mi&s;cheifs have befallen the country by means of the church, (of which however, he gives no proof); to this I an&s;wer, certain it is, that great advantages have derived from it, even to the di&s;&s;enters them|&s;elves: it has occa&s;ioned a great increa&s;e of knowledge, by their reading many of our excellent writers, from whom they have gained their be&s;t notion's, and much greater correctne&s;s, than they had, both in writing and &s;peaking; it has provoked them to emulation, and it is certain, that many of them have much better notions of God and the go&s;pel now, than they had before, and have much improved in the knowledge of the &s;criptures and the evidences of chri&s;titanity.&mdash;Certain it is, that they are now, much be|yond what they were, fifty years ago, and as certain that they are greatly beholden to the church, for every thing of this kind, wherein they excel them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides this, in proportion as they have become more acquainted with the church, they have much dropp'd their great prejudices again&s;t us, and malevolence, and unchari|tablene&s;s towards us, and charity, and good neighbourhood have greatly obtained between us; &s;o that, if it was not for now and then, &s;uch abu&s;ive and uncharitable &s;cribblings of a few zealots, full of very injurious mi&s;repre&s;entations, we &s;hould &s;oon coale&s;ce, and come into a friendly, bene|volent and chri&s;tian temper, of mutual forbearance towards one another, and be united in our common weal&mdash;I might add, that in truth the church has been &s;o far from med|ling in the various contentions in which they have been al|mo&s;t continually engaged among them&s;elves, owing to the weakne&s;s of their con&s;titution, and their republican &s;epa|rating and levelling principles, that, to my certain know|ledge,
<PB N="87" REF="009360_0090_10321256A7E8ACC0">it hath in many in&s;tances been a great check upon them, and much rather tended to heal and quiet, than ex|a&s;perate them&mdash;And as to immoralities, I am &s;ure, the church hath born as faithful a te&s;timony again&s;t them, in every kind, as any of the di&s;&s;enters have done; &s;o that, if immoralities have increa&s;ed, it is not owing to the in|crea&s;e of the church, but to the increa&s;e of mankind here, in proportion to which, from the nature of man, immorali|ties will abound; I believe however, it may be &s;aid with truth, that in proportion to her numbers, the church can &s;hew, at lea&s;t as many &s;ober, con&s;cientious chri&s;tians, as the meetings: I know it to be &s;o, in many places where I am acquainted.</P>
<P>Now, whether it was to give a &s;pecimen of the Dr's &s;ine talent at ridicule and declamation, or, from a &s;tudied de&s;ign to fright his readers, with an hideous &s;pectre, that he might create in them all the odium and antipathy he could again&s;t the church of <HI>England,</HI> or, whether it was a little fit of the old di&s;traction, or, whether after all, the true and principal cau&s;e of his bitterne&s;s again&s;t that found branch of the chri&s;tian church may not &s;till be art|fully concealed, I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but in page 155 you have a mo&s;t hideous outcry, about per&s;ecution, hierarchy, tyranny and the like terrible mon&s;ters, that made &s;ad work, it &s;eems, an hundred, or an hundred and fifty years ago, from which, however he allows at la&s;t, we have now nothing to fear &s;ince the revolution, from our pre&s;ent mild princes, and moderate prelates.&mdash;Pray, good &s;ir, what then was the matter with you, when you made this tragical out|cry? Did you de&s;ign to &s;et a mob upon us? or what?</P>
<P>You know very well, that the con&s;titution of the church is ju&s;t the &s;ame now as it was then, and yet &s;he abhors per|&s;ecution, and tyranny now, (at lea&s;t) as much as you do: Why &s;hould &s;he then be charged with the doings of tyran|nous courts, or &s;ome per&s;ecuting individuals, &s;o long ago? or how can &s;he be an&s;werable for tho&s;e things, which for almo&s;t the&s;e hundred years have had no exi&s;tence, nor are ever like to exi&s;t again? or, what &s;en&s;e or hone&s;ty can there be, in rai&s;ing the&s;e old &s;pectres, long &s;ince vani&s;hed and gone, never to revive, meerly to blacken the church,
<PB N="88" REF="009360_0091_103212582A590C98">and render her odious to the pre&s;ent age while in truth the church is no more concerned in them, than your party, who you mu&s;t needs know, have per&s;eacuted and tyranniz'd in their turn, as much, at lea&s;t, as ever the government who then profe&s;&s;ed the church did: You know that per&s;ecution and toleration are merely political things, in which the church, as &s;uch, (being a &s;piritual &s;ociety, a kingdom not of this world,) is in no wife concern'd: The church is the &s;ame; it is the policy of the &s;tate only, that hath altered, and I readily agree with you, that in putting an end to per|&s;ecution, it hath altered much for the better.</P>
<P>But the good Dr. is &s;till terribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, about the hierar|chy, lea&s;t that &s;hould obtain here, a&s;cending (as he &s;ays, in his fine florid way, a-la-mode de independent whig.) <HI>a&s;cending by various gradations from the dirt to the &s;kies!</HI> But pray Dr, be &s;ober a little&mdash;We have no pope! There are with us but three orders, bi&s;hops, presbyters and deacons, accord|ing to the model of the pure primitive church, long be|fore the lea&s;t &s;tep was made towards popery. And we know that we have &s;tronger evidence from the <HI>facts</HI> both of <HI>&s;cripture</HI> and <HI>antiquity,</HI> for the mo&s;t wi&s;e, apo&s;tolical, and con&s;equently divine e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e three orders, than you have for infant bapti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath, of which you are with us &s;o ju&s;tly tenacious.&mdash;Your rea|&s;oning upon the&s;e points, and ours for epi&s;copacy, from the original facts, is exactly the &s;ame, only we have va&s;tly the advantage of you.&mdash;If our rea&s;oning for epi&s;copacy mu&s;t fall, your's on tho&s;e points mu&s;t much more fall with it; as might be abundantly and inconte&s;tably &s;hewn, if it was now before us.&mdash;And we do averr, we are certainly as con&s;cientious in our attachment to our epi&s;copal form of church government, as you can be to your presbyterial, or whatever you call it.&mdash;In God's name, then, what rea&s;on can be given, why we &s;hould not be allowed to enjoy our way, as well as you, your's? We do not envy you, why &s;hould you envy and malign us?&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray tell me &s;ir, why we &s;hould not be allowed in this country, to be as perfect in our kind, as you, in your's? We do not want in the lea&s;t to mole&s;t or oppo&s;e you, in your way, why then &s;hould you &s;o vehemently oppo&s;e
<PB N="89" REF="009360_0092_1032125A98B7CA10">our being provided for in our's? You would think it a terrible thing indeed, (doubtle&s;s a degree of per&s;ecution,) to be obliged to go a thou&s;and leagues for ordination, if it was your ca&s;e: can you then have no feeling for us who&s;e unhappy ca&s;e it is? In truth &s;ir, we do not aim at any thing but to live with you in quiet and charitable neighbourhood: We have not the lea&s;t de&s;ire of an epi&s;copate that &s;hould have any thing to do with you, or at all interfere with any of your proceedings, or, make any alterations among you, in church or &s;tate: We only want bi&s;hops, to ordain, and govern <HI>our own</HI> clergy, to vi&s;it <HI>our</HI> churches, and to in&s;truct and confirm <HI>our</HI> laity: And I de&s;ire to know, what harm, &s;uch an epi&s;copate could do you? Nay; we do not in&s;i&s;t upon a bi&s;hop's re&s;iding in either of your favourite govern|ments: Let him live in one of your heatheni&s;h provinces: We &s;hould be content to wait upon him for orders, two or three hundred miles di&s;tant from you, rather than fail; Why then &s;hould you have &s;uch terrible apprehen&s;ions?</P>
<P>But the Dr. is moreover in a di&s;mal pannic, le&s;t the church's obtaining in this country, &s;hould be of ill con&s;e|quence to it's political affairs.&mdash;But why &s;hould he? Pray &s;ir be calm&mdash;Is not this our country, and the native country of mo&s;t of us, as well as your's? Can it then be, that it &s;hould not be as dear to us, as it is to you? Have we not all one common intere&s;t, as to our country's weal, being embark'd in the &s;ame bottom? It is not po&s;&s;ible for us, each one judging for him&s;elf, to abound in his own &s;en&s;e, as to matters of religion, and yet live in love, and be unit|ed heart and hand, in promoting the publick weal, and our common intere&s;ts, wherein we are all agreed, and equally concern'd? I can &s;ee no manner of rea&s;on to the contrary, or any more danger, le&s;t we &s;hould differ about the&s;e pub|lick affairs, than if we were all of the &s;ame &s;entiments in re|ligion: and have we not been as forward in our country's cau&s;e in the late trying times as any of you? Di&s;putes will &s;ometimes ari&s;e; But I cannot &s;ee, why they &s;hould more in one ca&s;e, than in the other? You need not be in the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive of the churches being any other wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, than it is already, or that any te&s;ts will obtain in &s;uch a
<PB N="90" REF="009360_0093_1032125C8A6FD830">country as this.&mdash;Pray &s;ir be ea&s;y. We mean you no harm&mdash; If you would be only as charitable and peaceable toward us, and among your&s;elves, as we are heartily di&s;po&s;ed to be to|wards you, we might live very quietly and happily together, and there would be no occa&s;ion for another <HI>Columbus,</HI> (as you cry out) to explore any other <HI>country</HI> for you. We are neither French, nor Indians, nor Serpents, nor <HI>Dragons:</HI> Why &s;o dreadfully afraid of being <HI>con&s;umed by the flames,</HI> or deluged <HI>in a flood of epi&s;copacy?</HI> I realy pity you, that you &s;hould &s;uffer your terrors and pa&s;&s;ions &s;o mi&s;erably to run away with you! I tell you again, dear &s;ir, we mean you no harm; we would only provide for our &s;elves&mdash;Pray do not be &s;o terribly frighted!&mdash;But O my country, dear <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you, that you have in|finitely more rea&s;on to be afraid of &s;uch as are no friends to a co-e&s;&s;ential trinity, and the divinity and &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t, (be&s;ides other misbeliever's, and unbelievers, of which there are many.) than of tho&s;e who without cen&s;ur|ing or aiming to interfere with di&s;&s;enters, are only de&s;irous for them&s;elves to enjoy the church of <HI>England,</HI> in its pri|mitive purity!&mdash;</P>
<P>But the Dr. in&s;i&s;ts that <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> come not within the Society's limits by the charter: I an&s;wer, this cannot be maintained, &s;ince they are not ex|cepted by the charter, unle&s;s it can be proved that the con|gregations of the church for which the Society provides in tho&s;e colonies, would not in the &s;en&s;e &amp; words of the charter, <HI>want,</HI> or be de&s;titute of <HI>the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments,</HI> if the Society did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them: But this he does not, nor can he prove. Surely he cannot pre|tend that King <HI>William,</HI> who introduced the toleration of di&s;&s;enters, would leave his loving &s;ubjects of the church un|tolerated, and under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving God's word and &s;acraments contrary to their con&s;ciences, or of having none.&mdash;It mu&s;t therefore be his meaning to provide, that his loving &s;ubjects of the church might enjoy God's word and &s;acraments in the&s;e colonies, when &s;uch there are in competent numbers, for congregations, as well as in other
<PB N="91" REF="009360_0094_1032125EAAB05458">colonies; and &s;o the Society (who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be at lea&s;t as good judges of the meaning of their charter, as Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>) have ever under&s;tood it, and when opportu|nity offered, have practi&s;ed accordingly, not for the purpo&s;e of converting di&s;&s;enters to the church, but of providing for con&s;cientious people of the church, and who without this provi&s;ion would have been in danger of as great errors and ab&s;urdities, as tho&s;e of popery,,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Friendly Expo&s;tulation, ju&s;t publi&s;h'd, page 30, 31, &amp;c.</NOTE> and not without danger even of infidelity it&s;elf, into which I fear many of the di&s;&s;enters have been tempted by the ab&s;urd notions of chri&s;tianity which have been di&s;&s;eminated among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Now <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> the great objection is, that the Society neg|lects the &s;outhern colonies, Negroes and Indians.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, As to the &s;outhern colonies, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Dr. mu&s;t know, that in <HI>Virginia. Maryland</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> the church is well provided for by law, &s;o that they are out of the que&s;tion&mdash;In <HI>South-Carolina</HI> they are withdraw|ing their mi&s;&s;ions, as they become vacant.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the <HI>Babama</HI> I&s;lands, pro|vi&s;ion is made and making for them as fa&s;t as may be, and as their occa&s;ion and application call for. And,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to <HI>North Carolina</HI> (over which he drops a pious tear) as far as I can find, ever &s;ince their application to the Society, they have been providing for them as often as they have been applied to, and as fa&s;t as they could find gentlemen to undertake mi&s;&s;ions, in tho&s;e tedious and un|healthy climates; and it appears from the ab&s;tract of 1761, that a great progre&s;s there is made, and making, and the Society is very much engaged to provide for them, &s;o that I imagine tho&s;e mu&s;t have been di&s;&s;enters for whom he is &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to <HI>Pen&s;ylvania. New-Jer&s;ies</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> I believe no in&s;tance can be produced, where appli|cation
<PB N="92" REF="009360_0095_1032126098D40888">has been made to the Society, that has ever been neglected. Indeed, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, there are &s;ome few places, where no provi&s;ion is made for religion, of any &s;ort, that have contracted &s;uch an indifference to any at all, (two of which I my&s;elf have often urged and engaged my endeavours for them) that they could never be prevail'd upon to embody them&s;elves, to build a church, or take any &s;tep towards applying to the Society for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who would undoubtedly do for them, even to the neglect of <HI>New-England.</HI> Now to &s;uch I could wi&s;h the Society to &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries without being applied to, as they would to <HI>ab origine</HI> heathen, and I tru&s;t they will do &s;o, before long, if tho&s;e people do not apply.</P>
<P>And now, as to <HI>Negroes,</HI> what could the Society do more than it does, and not without &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, as ap|pears by the Ab&s;tracts&mdash;Their mi&s;&s;ionaries every where in|&s;truct as many as their ma&s;ters will &s;end, and do in&s;truct and baptize many, and have &s;ome communicants&mdash;They have &s;everal catechi&s;ts, and Dr. <HI>Bray</HI>'s a&s;&s;ociates, &s;everal &s;chools (be&s;ides that at <HI>Barbadoes</HI>) who con&s;tantly in&s;truct their chil|dren with good &s;ucce&s;s; and they have &s;ent one worthy mi&s;&s;i|onary to <HI>Cape Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle,</HI> who laboured there, 'till his health and con&s;titution were very near ruined.&mdash;And,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the Indians&mdash;Many mi&s;&s;ionaries have to my knowledge endeavoured to convert them, as they have had opportunity; and one in particular placed near a con&s;iderable clan of them, endeavoured to reconcile them to chri&s;tianity, 'till &s;ome di&s;&s;enters &s;o prejudiced them again&s;t him, that he could do them no Good&mdash;And it is well known, that the So|ciety, (always ready to take every opportunity) has &s;ent &s;eve|ral mi&s;&s;ionaries to the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> one after another, from the beginning, and that the Rev. and worthy Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> was very laborious, with good &s;ucce&s;s for ten years, in&s;tructed and baptized many, and had a con&s;iderable number of communi|cants. It is true, he laboured at fir&s;t under &s;ome difficulty, for want of an interpreter; but it was not long before he ac|quired &s;o good &s;kill in their language, as to preach and per|form the &s;ervice to their perfect under&s;tanding, and was go|ing
<PB N="93" REF="009360_0096_10321262D658DB10">on with very good &s;ucce&s;s, till the la&s;t war, about 1745. threw them into &s;uch confu&s;ion, and the influence of popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the wicked in&s;inuations of a certain great man in tho&s;e parts, created &s;uch a di&s;affection in them, that his very life was in much danger; &s;o that he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So partially and injuriou&s;ly, not to &s;ay fal&s;ly, does Mr. Smith in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hi&s;tory of <HI>New York</HI> repre&s;ent this affair.</NOTE>&mdash;However, the Society has &s;till a number there not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and much more will &s;oon be done; one thing they intend in order to it, is, to maintain a number of lads to|gether at <HI>King's College</HI> in <HI>New-York,</HI> to be qualified for mi&s;&s;ionaries among them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, It may be truly &s;aid, what could the So|ciety do more, that it has not done, and all intirely agreeable to the true intention and meaning of their charter. I cannot therefore, imagine but that the candid and &s;erious, even among the di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> has mo&s;t unju&s;tly charged the Society, and that his own friends can &s;carcely be able to withold a blu&s;h for him, at his indecent, as well as injurious treatment of that venerable body, and of the church, which is a part of the national con&s;titution; and al&s;o, at his mean and unworthy per&s;onal invectives again&s;t the mode&s;t and very de&s;erving gentleman, who has been the innocent occa&s;ion of provoking his riotous pen.&mdash;But I mu&s;t have done.&mdash;I would only add, that the worthy Dr. <HI>Wiggle&s;worth's</HI> letter in the 165th page of Dr. <HI>Mayhew's</HI> book, much de&s;erves the attention of the government both here and in England.&mdash;</P>
