<HEAD>ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the peace of &s;eventeen hundred and &s;ixty-three, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try propo&s;ed to rai&s;e a revenue by act of Parliament, from their American colonies. The &s;um, which, in this man|ner, they determined to rai&s;e, was indeed &s;mall, and not equal to the hazard of a revolution, or the expence of a war; but the people of America &s;aw that a violation of principle ought to be re&s;i&s;ted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and at all hazards; and that, if they once yielded to extortion, there would be no end of demands; and if they once abandoned their right of &s;elf-government, there would be no re&s;traint on oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Re&s;i&s;tance, war, and a revolution en&s;ued. Pro|vidence countenanced the American cau&s;e, rai&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="033269_0003_0FF6B2AD2F321B88">up to us allies among the rivals and enemies of Bri|tain, and the colonies were acknowledged free and independent States.</P>
<P>But as waves long agitated by the wind do not &s;ub&s;ide at the moment of the calm, the rancorous pa&s;&s;ions excited by the revolution war were not &s;oothed by the peace of 1783; but reciprocally &s;tirred in the bo&s;om of Britain and America. Con|cealed enmity, a delay of ju&s;tice, and alternate in|jury, were the con&s;equences. The treaty of peace was not executed on either &s;ide. <HI>They</HI> complained that they were not permitted to recover their debts. <HI>We,</HI> that we were not permitted to occupy our po&s;ts. The&s;e, &s;till maintained by Briti&s;h garri&s;ons, pre|vented the &s;ale and &s;ettlement of an exten&s;ive coun|try, and if they did not excite and countenance, at lea&s;t di&s;abled us from &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, a pernicious and expen&s;ive Indian war.</P>
<P>During all this time, America regarded France with a gratitude and affection approaching enthu|&s;ia&s;m. France, next to the courage and per&s;eve|rance of the American people, was regarded as an in&s;trument under God of &s;ecuring American inde|pendence. Yet France her&s;elf never pretended that &s;he engaged in our conte&s;t from any affection for liberty, or for the United States; but from ho&s;|tility to Britain and a de&s;ire to weaken this ancient
<PB N="5" REF="033269_0004_0FF6B2AF8C848F30">enemy, by depriving her of the ample &s;ource of commerce and wealth which the American colonies furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is thus that the Almighty in who&s;e hands are the hearts of kings and of all men, &s;ometimes con|verts their wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; into in&s;truments of u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The lu&s;t of Henry VIII. was made an in&s;trument of the reformation in England; and the enmity of France again&s;t Britain was made an in&s;trument of American independence.</P>
<P>The theories of philo&s;ophy and the practical le&s;|&s;ons of the American revolution kindled a fire of liberty in France which &s;oon blazed into a flame and con&s;umed the fabric of her former govern|ment.</P>
<P>America viewed the commencement of the French revolution with &s;ympathy and hope, and its progre&s;s with exultation and triumph. The cau&s;e of France was con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of li|berty&mdash;as our cau&s;e. We excu&s;ed her outrages, we deplored her defeats, we rejoiced in her victories, as if they were all our own. She needed not, &s;he declared that &s;he did not de&s;ire the aid of our arms. But we made every exertion to &s;upply her and her colonies with provi&s;ions, in the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable and efficacious manner. We received her citizens with
<PB N="6" REF="033269_0005_0FF6B2B138F9A5C8">every mark of ho&s;pitality. Our government in|&s;tantly, and fir&s;t of all the nations of the earth, acknowledged her as a Republic, and defying all chance of counter-revolution and the ri&s;k of Bri|ti&s;h re&s;entment, paid to the agents of this republic, at a time of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and before it was due, every dollar of our debt to the king. France can|not charge the people of America with want of gra|titude, nor the government of America with want of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Yet though the American government went to the utmo&s;t extent of duty, by a punctual and a ge|nerous performance of her treaties and obligations, as France declared it to be her wi&s;h, America knew it to be her intere&s;t, by not over&s;tepping the boun|dary of duty, to pre&s;erve her&s;elf from war. Ame|rica in the European war would have been but as a drop in the bucket, and her entering into it on the &s;ide of France, would have increa&s;ed her debt, ruined her trade, and made her an u&s;ele&s;s ally, and an impoveri&s;hed and burdened nation. She could aid France better by neutrality than by being a party in the war.&mdash;Our government, therefore, and with profe&s;&s;ions of approbation from France, de|termined on a &s;trict and impartial neutrality, and, while con&s;i&s;tently with neutrality, &s;he hone&s;tly and u&s;efully &s;erved France, adhered to this determina|tion with unimpeachable &s;incerity and per&s;everance.
<PB N="7" REF="033269_0006_0FF6B2B369DF6BE0">Ample proof has been made of this by Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, in his letter for the recall of Mr. Genet.</P>
<P>But the profe&s;&s;ions and the purpo&s;es of France did not agree. Mr. Genet, the very mini&s;ter, who on his arrival at Philadelphia, publicly declared, that it was not the wi&s;h nor intere&s;t of France that America &s;hould engage in the war, afterwards pub|li&s;hed in&s;tructions given him by the French govern|ment before his departure from France, enjoining him to endeavour to engage America in the war again&s;t Britain. The inflexible prudence of the Pre&s;ident precluded all hope of Mr. Genet's &s;uc|ceeding with the government, in this &s;ubject of his in&s;tructions. He had recour&s;e, therefore, to other means. He fitted out privateers in our ports, he commi&s;&s;ioned and engaged our citizens to enter on board tho&s;e privateers. Briti&s;h &s;hips were taken within our juri&s;diction, and &s;old in our ports. Clubs or &s;ocieties were, under his &s;ugge&s;tions, formed throughout the continent; to hang on the &s;kirts of government, cen&s;ure all its mea&s;ures and weaken its authority, by rendering it &s;u&s;pected, and to rou&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, and prepare them for a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and even ardent devotion to the will of France. The inevitable tendency of the mea&s;ures of Mr. Genet to embroil us with Bri|tain, engage us in the war, and thus make us de|pendent on France, is clearly expo&s;ed by Mr. Jef|fer&s;on
<PB N="8" REF="033269_0007_0FF6B2B61BEB81B8">in the letter already referred to.&mdash;The mea|&s;ures of Mr. Genet were pur&s;ued though le&s;s openly with not le&s;s per&s;everance by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: and it has been the con&s;tant object of the mini&s;ters of France to give to that government an influence in this country, by dividing the people from our admini&s;tration, and turning the efforts of the peo|ple again&s;t the efforts of the executive to &s;ubject our public coun&s;els to the will of France, to main|tain among the people an ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition to Britain, and, by gradual and indirect means com|pel our government into open war with that nation.</P>
<P>Though the prudent and active &s;pirit of the Pre|&s;ident pre&s;erved us from the full effect of tho&s;e in&s;idious machinations&mdash;an open war with Britain, and a con&s;equent dependence on France; yet tho&s;e machinations and the intemperate partiality and zeal for France manife&s;ted by the people, and by a &s;trong party in Congre&s;s, could not fail to draw on us the &s;u&s;picion of Britain, that we could not long re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e inducements to war, and &s;hould very &s;oon be actually engaged in it. France had, with re&s;pect to our trading &s;hips, very early in the war, ca&s;t off any regard to the treaty of commerce between her and America. Britain had no commercial treaty with us, and was bound to us in this re&s;pect, only by the general law of nations. Even this law both nations &s;oon cea&s;ed to regard.
<PB N="9" REF="033269_0008_0FF6B2B85BD5B3B0">France &s;et, and Britain followed the example, of making unju&s;tifiable &s;poliations of our trade. What will not men do, when they have power with|out immediate controul! The &s;poliations of Bri|tain had amounted to a va&s;t &s;um, and threatened the ruin of our commerce; when mea&s;ures were propo&s;ed by tho&s;e called the friends of France in Congre&s;s to check tho&s;e &s;poliations. An embargo was adopted, and afterwards (at the reque&s;t of the French mini&s;ter, who wanted to &s;end &s;upplies to their We&s;t India i&s;lands) was taken off. Commer|cial regulations, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of commerce with Britain, and a &s;eque&s;tration of Briti&s;h debts were propo&s;ed. Tho&s;e members of Congre&s;s, who had approved the neutral mea&s;ures of the Pre&s;ident, and were de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the United States in peace, con&s;idered tho&s;e mea&s;ures as nece&s;&s;arily tending to war with Britain, and &s;ome as being in fact a cau&s;e of it. The Pre&s;ident &s;eemed to have viewed them in the &s;ame light, and determined fir&s;t to try whether a negociation would not obtain ju&s;|tice. The friends of the mea&s;ures thus prevented declaimed again&s;t a negociation under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, loudly extolled the force and &s;pirit of Ame|rica, reprobated the ba&s;ene&s;s of national &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to inju&s;tice, and declared, that there was no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in negociation un&s;upported by the pro|po&s;ed vigorous mea&s;ures. Tho&s;e of the &s;ame party in the Senate reprobated the appointment of the
<PB N="10" REF="033269_0009_0FF6B2BA33607358">negociator. And pains were taken, that both he and the negociation &s;hould be con&s;idered as odious and un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>All prophets, like Jonah, are angry, if their pro|phecy be not accompli&s;hed; and their endeavours are &s;eldom wanting to promote its accompli&s;hment. The pro&s;pect of a negociation with Britain &s;eemed fatal to the hope of France and her agents here, of involving us in the war. Tho&s;e in Congre&s;s who&s;e propo&s;itions were thereby prevented, felt the chagrin of di&s;appointment. Thus a va&s;t intere&s;t was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States again&s;t any treaty whatever with Britain. Even before the treaty was known, it was attacked by conjecture. No &s;ooner was it known, than town-meetings a&s;|&s;embled in the mo&s;t tumultuous manner, and with|out argument or deliberation condemned it. It was cen&s;ured for faults which had no exi&s;tence, and evils created by imagination. The treaty was op|po&s;ed in every &s;tage, and even after it became a law a &s;trong party in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives en|deavoured to defeat it. But it triumphed over all oppo&s;ition, the po&s;ts were &s;urrendered, our claims for &s;poliations were put in an equitable mode of adju&s;tment. And great progre&s;s has, in con|&s;equence, been made in adju&s;ting and paying them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="033269_0010_0FF6B2BCED2213C0">
For a long time after the treaty was ratified and publi&s;hed, France made little if any objections to it; and if &s;he made any they were &s;ugge&s;ted to her by her partizans among our&s;elves. Had they been &s;ilent, &s;o would France have been. But it was evi|dent, if the prophecies of menace and re&s;entment uttered by the partizans of France here were not fulfilled, they would lo&s;e all credit and con&s;equence; our government would triumph; tho&s;e popular leaders would &s;ink into in&s;ignificance; the influ|ence of France on this country would cea&s;e; our government would be re&s;tored to its confidence and authority; and the United States become really independent.</P>
<P>In&s;tigated therefore by their party here, and to pre&s;erve its hold on the people of this country, and keep them dependent, by weakening the admini&s;tra|tion by a &s;eparation of the people from it, the French government at la&s;t complained that our treaty with Britain was injurious to France; of them&s;elves took upon them to new-model their treaty with us; and proceeded to new and exorbitant &s;poliations on our commerce.</P>
<P>That their objections to the Briti&s;h treaty, and all their objections to the conduct of our government were but pretexts, and that the true motive of their re&s;entment was to maintain their influence in
<PB N="12" REF="033269_0011_0FF6B2BF1D8B89A0">this country to u&s;e the people again&s;t the govern|ment of the United States, and thereby &s;ubject both to the will of France; mu&s;t be evident to every candid and intelligent man, who reads the French objections to the Briti&s;h treaty, and to other parts of the conduct of our admini&s;tration, as &s;tated in Mr. Adet's letter to our &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and compares it with that plain and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to all tho&s;e objections in the letter of the &s;ecretary. It mu&s;t be &s;till more evident from the critical time which Mr. Adet cho&s;e to &s;tate tho&s;e objections, and from his publi&s;hing them to the people ju&s;t before the election of Electors of a Pre&s;ident of the United States, when one of the candidates for that &s;tation was &s;uppo&s;ed to be devoted to the intere&s;ts of France, and was zealou&s;ly &s;upported by all their par|tizans and agents in this country.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who do not read, and to tho&s;e who read without thinking, all argument on this head is vain. But to tho&s;e who have con&s;idered the treaty, the objections, and the an&s;wers, I may &s;afely appeal. And I challenge any man, to point out any part of the Briti&s;h treaty which is injurious to France, or which gives to Britain any advantage, which as an independent and neutral nation, we had not a right to give. If this be the ca&s;e, and that it is the ca&s;e has been often proved, and may be confidently believed, they mu&s;t have a wretched opinion of the
<PB N="13" REF="033269_0012_0FF6B2C15012CAB8">principles, moderation, and integrity of the French government, who can think the Briti&s;h treaty a cau&s;e of war by France again&s;t America. What! are we a &s;overeign and independent nation, and have we not a right to make &s;uch contracts as we plea&s;e, harmle&s;s to other nations? are we yet in a &s;tate of infancy, and our acts to be con&s;idered void, and grounds of cha&s;ti&s;ement, unle&s;s approved by our guardians? Did we emancipate our&s;elves from the dominion of Britain, only to &s;ubject our&s;elves to the dominion of France? Are the United States independent, if they dare not make &s;uch treaties as they plea&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with prior engagements, and the general law of nations? And is the &s;pirit, of 1776 &s;o completely extingui&s;hed in the American brea&s;t, that we &s;hall now tamely &s;ubmit to encroach|ments which then we re&s;i&s;ted and repelled? Tame conce&s;&s;ions to unju&s;t demands, like the beginnings of &s;trife, are, as the letting out of water: the dam once broken, an irre&s;i&s;table flood will ru&s;h in, and overwhelm us.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the making of the Briti&s;h treaty a cau&s;e of war by France again&s;t America, a violation of it, or a refu&s;al to comply with it, would clearly have been a cau&s;e of war by Britain again&s;t Ame|rica. Britain had her complaints as well as we, and having propo&s;ed a rea&s;onable accommodation, if we refu&s;ed to comply with it, had a right to em|ploy
<PB N="14" REF="033269_0013_0FF6B2C381488978">force to compel us. This right would have been the &s;ame, if no treaty had been made, but merely a demand and refu&s;al to pay Briti&s;h debts. We have not to con&s;ider now, only whether the Briti&s;h treaty be the cau&s;e of the re&s;entment and aggre&s;&s;ions of France; but al&s;o, what would have been our condition if that treaty had not been made, or being made, had been broken, or not exe|cuted. We &s;hould then, probably, have had an Indian war on our frontiers, and a war with Bri|tain at &s;ea. It is not hard to determine whether that, or our pre&s;ent &s;tate, with all we can fear from France, be the greater evil. Suppo&s;ing an inva|&s;ion of our country from either, France could in|deed rai&s;e, but probably could not tran&s;port a greater army than Britain. But &s;uppo&s;ing, as perhaps is the ca&s;e, an inva&s;ion not probable, and only a &s;ea war; there is no compari&s;on between the naval power of Britain and that of France, perhaps and that of the world: and our danger would be in proportion to the power of our enemy. If we have incurred therefore a danger, by making the Briti&s;h treaty, we have thereby e&s;caped a far greater danger; an Indian war, and a &s;ea war with the greate&s;t naval power in the world.</P>
<P>But there is another difference between the two ca&s;es, a difference which by all who believe and re|gard a divine Providence will never be lo&s;t &s;ight of.
<PB N="15" REF="033269_0014_0FF6B2C52A684ED8">In our di&s;pute with France we are contending for principle, for ju&s;tice, and for our independent rights, and re&s;i&s;ting oppre&s;&s;ion and unju&s;t domi|nion. In the di&s;pute to have been feared with Bri|tain, if we refu&s;ed a peaceable accommodation, we &s;hould have had to contend for inju&s;tice and iniquity. In our di&s;pute with France, we have a a good cau&s;e; in that with Britain, we &s;hould have had a bad cau&s;e. Courage, and, if we can tru&s;t in Providence, &s;ucce&s;s, is in proportion to con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>But though the Briti&s;h treaty furni&s;hed no ju&s;ti|fication, it was u&s;ed as a pretext, for drawing on us the anger and vengeance of France. This ven|geance was thought nece&s;&s;ary, to give con&s;equence to their party, and maintain their hold on the people again&s;t the government of America. It was the only remaining mean of preventing the com|plete emancipation of the United States from the yoke of foreign influence.</P>
<P>At an important time to influence the election of a Pre&s;ident of the United States, Mr. Adet an|nounced not only to the government, but to the people, the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of his diplomatic powers in this country, accompanied with vehement but &s;illy and groundle&s;s complaints again&s;t the government of the United States. This menace failing to pro|duce
<PB N="16" REF="033269_0015_0FF6B2C80D285110">the intended effect, the election of Mr. Jef|fer&s;on as Pre&s;ident, was &s;oon followed by the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t injuries to our trade, the capture of our ve&s;&s;els, on the mo&s;t frivolous and unju&s;tifiable pretexts; till the damages have amounted, it has been &s;aid, to thirty million of dollars. Payment was al&s;o refu&s;ed of a large debt contracted by the agents of France for provi&s;ions furni&s;hed on the credit of that go|vernment. And it became the avowed object of France to compel the United States to an implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her will, or to ruin them.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e inva&s;ions of our rights, depreda|tions of our property, machinations again&s;t our peace and independence, and intrigues to draw us into the war, the French government had been en|couraged by our mini&s;ter in France, a weak zea|lot, &s;ub&s;ervient to their ambition and in&s;olence. He fo&s;tered their hope that the people of the United States were ready to make a common cau&s;e with France, and would cheerfully &s;ubmit to any in|va&s;ion of their rights or &s;poliations of their com|merce, that would contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of that cau&s;e. He neglected, in &s;pite of the po&s;itive and repeated in&s;tructions of the Pre&s;ident, effectually to remon&s;trate again&s;t the violations of our treaty and neutral rights, committed on our commerce by the French &s;hips of war and privateers. He neglected al&s;o, contrary to expre&s;s in&s;tructions, to give to the
<PB N="17" REF="033269_0016_0FF6B2CA3A41DD38">French government the nece&s;&s;ary explanations of our treaty with Britain, and point out the mi&s;con|ceptions on which the prejudice of France again&s;t it, and the conduct of our government generally were founded. And he not only encouraged but &s;trongly recommended a loan of money, by the United States to France, which would have been a plain breach of neutrality, and an open taking part in the war, and, of cour&s;e, a cau&s;e of war again&s;t us by all the enemies of France. By &s;pe|culations in the French funds, he purcha&s;ed a princely palace in the vicinity of Paris. His hou&s;e was a re&s;ort for all di&s;contented Americans, where they were in&s;tructed by him not in re&s;pect, but di&s;|affection of their own government. At his table he read and mi&s;repre&s;ented our treaty with Britain. In his hou&s;e he entertained the profligate and im|pious Paine, while he wrote his &s;candalous letter to General Wa&s;hington, and had it recited to him as it was compo&s;ed, for his amu&s;ement.&mdash;And, at a public entertainment, he retired, while the health of the Pre&s;ident was drank, and immediately after returned. When &s;uch was the treacherous conduct of our mini&s;ter, no wonder that the French govern|ment broke through all re&s;traints of decency or ju&s;tice to us, no wonder that the Pre&s;ident recalled him, and no wonder that the Directory parted with him with regret.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="033269_0017_0FF6B2CC6FF8BB30">
As the French government were thus &s;educed to a fal&s;e confidence in the ba&s;ene&s;s and depravity of the American &s;pirit; neither need we wonder that the American people were &s;o long deluded by a fal&s;e opinion of the virtue of France, and have only renounced that opinion, when it becomes too plain to be denied, that the French government have abandoned all regard to God, to government, to ju&s;tice, or to decency. Va&s;t and ince&s;&s;ant pains have been taken throughout this country, to mi&s;lead the under&s;tanding and the judgment of the people. Pamphlets and new&s;papers have been continually i&s;&s;uing from the pre&s;s, for the avowed purpo&s;e of de&s;troying all tru&s;t in God, and all confidence in our government. No public character, not even the virtue of a Wa&s;hington, nor religion it&s;elf, has e&s;caped abu&s;e and defamation. Every act of the government has been cen&s;ured and mi&s;repre&s;ented and even the motives and intentions of public offi|cers have been perverted and mi&s;tated. Every thing done by our government has been repre&s;ented as con&s;tantly wrong, every thing done again&s;t us by the French, or any other government under their influence, as con&s;tantly right; till we have &s;eemed more willing to obey a mandate of the French Direc|tory, than a &s;olemn act of our own admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e &s;tatements of public tran&s;|actions have been &s;upported by many who having
<PB N="19" REF="033269_0018_0FF66B96D09D0188">more concern in the admini&s;tration, or being near the &s;ource of information might have known (if in fact they did not know) better. Many of our mem|bers of A&s;&s;embly and members of Congre&s;s not only in conver&s;ations but in letters have taken the utmo&s;t pains to di&s;&s;eminate &s;u&s;picions and ill opi|nions of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable officers and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures of the admini&s;tration; and have rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the citizens to know the truth, or to form a right judgment of men or things. Hence the opinions and duties of the citizens were perverted. And, as the nature of man is prone to believe &s;lander, the authors of tho&s;e mi&s;repre&s;en|tations became popular in proportion to their ma|lignity, and influenced the opinions and elections of the people.</P>
<P>Of all whom I have had an opportunity of ob|&s;erving, the member of Congre&s;s from the adjoin|ing di&s;trict has been the mo&s;t bu&s;y and mi&s;chievous. With a reputation for candour, patrioti&s;m and truth, which gave to all his &s;tatements the confi|dence of authenticity, his letters have filled the country with fal&s;e opinions of the acts and officers of government, and fal&s;e vindications of every thing done again&s;t it. The fal&s;ehood and malig|nity of many of his repre&s;entations have been di&s;|covered, and, if he have any value of reputation, he will now cea&s;e to promote di&s;affection to the re|gular

But hitherto they have had a pernicious influence on the judg|ment and conduct of the people of this country. He has publi&s;hed them in new&s;papers. He has &s;ent under cover to po&s;tma&s;ters, whom he knew di&s;po&s;ed to be organs of the propagation of his opinions, his letters to his corre&s;pondents open, for the purpo&s;e of being read and publi&s;hed by tho&s;e po&s;tma&s;ters. His letters have been very frequent, and his corre&s;pondents often of a &s;ort not &s;uffi|ciently qualified to detect or correct the error and poi&s;on conveyed in them. The late me&s;&s;age of the Pre&s;ident has been a complete confutation of &s;ome of the mo&s;t malignant parts of them. It becomes every man to aid in expo&s;ing them, in order to re|&s;tore the people who have been mi&s;led by them, to a right judgment and conduct, and pre&s;erve the country from the dangerous effects of their delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>While the people of America were thus mi&s;re|pre&s;ented by our mini&s;ter in France, and mi&s;led by the partizans of France here, and while prejudice and fal&s;e opinions of the American government were thus indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted and cultivated, both there and here; we need not recur to the Bri|ti&s;h treaty, nor to any conduct of our admini&s;tra|tion, for the cau&s;es of the French aggre&s;&s;ions on
<PB N="21" REF="033269_0020_0FF6B2D309A1BA90">America, for they may be accounted for from the nature of man and the general principles and con|duct of the French government.</P>
<P>Power without re&s;traint or accountability &s;eldom fails to be abu&s;ed in the hands of men. The French had triumphed over all their enemies and were elat|ed with victory. It was the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the powers of government to keep the na|tion embroiled, in order to maintain their &s;tation and influence. Early in the French revolution they publicly declared that they were ready to unite with a party in any nation to change the form of their government. And this, whatever they might after|wards profe&s;s, they ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ued, wherever they had opportunity. It was indifferent to them whether the government which they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;affected to de&s;troy was a monarchy or a republic, arbitrary or free. The point with them was to ex|cite and &s;upport a party, promote confu&s;ion, and &s;o acquire influence, predominancy, and plunder. Flanders, Holland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Venice, are ample proofs of this &s;pirit. The plunder of the church, the bani&s;hment and murder of their fellow citizens, the perpetual de&s;truction and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parties, and above all the contempt and extinction of all principles of morality, hu|manity, and religion, &s;hew, that we need not look beyond their own character, for cau&s;es of mi&s;chief
<PB N="22" REF="033269_0021_0FF6B2D4C67BF920">from the French government. Can we expect ju&s;|tice from men who deny it to each other? Will tho&s;e re&s;pect the rights of man, who contemn the rights of God? Can we expect any decency or right from men with power in their hands, who de|ny a God and a future &s;tate?</P>
<P>It is not therefore in the Briti&s;h treaty, nor in any part of the conduct of our own government, but in the character of the French government, and in our own divi&s;ions excited by the &s;lander and abu&s;e of our public officers, and mea&s;ures, that we are to look for the cau&s;es of the French aggre&s;&s;ions. A love of plunder and univer&s;al domination is plainly &s;een in all the conduct of the French go|vernment. And the influence they had acquired here, and the fatal divi&s;ion between the people and the government, which they and their partizans had &s;o ince&s;&s;antly and &s;ucce&s;sfully promoted; &s;hew|ed us to be weak, becau&s;e divided, and therefore defencele&s;s, and an ea&s;y prey. An hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand. The French govern|ment might therefore freely indulge their pa&s;&s;ion for plunder and power, unrelentingly per&s;i&s;t in their violation of our rights, and &s;poliation of our com|merce, and &s;et our government at defiance; &s;ince they had a party among our&s;elves of &s;trength and di&s;po&s;ition competent to defeat every purpo&s;e of the government, and render all its mea&s;ures odious.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="033269_0022_0FF6B2D774EA4F78">
Confident therefore in the&s;e means of defeating any exertion for maintaining our national &s;overeign|ty, and determined to reduce us to a &s;tate of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and dependence, when a mini&s;ter was &s;ent to Paris, who really would ob&s;erve the in&s;tructions of the Pre&s;ident, and would not &s;ubmit to be a tool of the Directory; they refu&s;ed to receive him and even threatened him with impri&s;onment, unle&s;s he left their territory. He accordingly retired to Hol|land, and waited for in&s;tructions from the Pre&s;ident, to direct his future conduct.</P>
<P>To have a ju&s;t feeling of this gro&s;s indignity, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the Briti&s;h court had thus rejected Mr. Jay, ob&s;tinately rejected all communication of complaints for the injuries done us, and told him he mu&s;t leave the country or perhaps go to pri&s;on: What would have been the indignation of Ameri|ca! And how would the cry of war have re&s;ound|ed from all the parti&s;ans of France, even from all &s;pirited Americans! And, was not the rejection of Mr. Pinckney by the French, a greater indignity? Is not indignity from a friend whom we have loved, and prai&s;ed, more grievous, than like treatment from a man whom we have hated and abu&s;ed?</P>
<P>Yet the American government did not re&s;ent this indignity, but refrained from ho&s;tility; and the pre&s;ent Pre&s;ident determined to make one effort
<PB N="24" REF="033269_0023_0FF6B2D9A5824B80">more for reconciliation. And, to give it more &s;o|lemnity, appointed three Envoys to the French Di|rectory, to endeavour to obtain ju&s;tice and peace, by &s;tipulating for compen&s;ation for pa&s;t, and &s;ecuri|ty again&s;t future injuries; in a new treaty &s;ettling all the di&s;puted con&s;tructions of the former, and fixing the terms of our future intercour&s;e with France.</P>
<P>It has been admitted by the greate&s;t &s;landerers of the Pre&s;ident, and even contrary to their own pre|vious &s;u&s;picions and reports, that the in&s;tructions gi|ven by the Pre&s;ident to his Envoys have been the mo&s;t liberal and candid, that could have been ju&s;ti|fiable. &mdash;They authorized the Envoys, if this were de&s;ired by the French, to modify the commercial treaty with France, according to the principles of the Briti&s;h treaty; to give up our claim for enemies property captured in ve&s;&s;els of the United States; to &s;tipulate for our accepting &s;ecurities payable at a future time, in&s;tead of money, for our claims for depredations on our commerce; and even not to in&s;i&s;t on &s;atisfaction of our claims as an indi&s;pen&s;a|ble condition of the propo&s;ed treaty.</P>
<P>With full powers and &s;uch liberal in&s;tructions, the envoys arrived in Paris on the 4th of October la&s;t, and the day following announced their arrival and their mi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs.
<PB N="25" REF="033269_0024_0FF6B2DBD8B09E20">His &s;ecretary gave information, that the Directory were exa&s;perated at Parts of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, that the negotiation would be conducted under the direction of this mini&s;ter, and they would have no audience of the Directory till it was fini&s;hed. Two weeks after their arrival, authorized and acknow|ledged agents of this mini&s;ter commenced conver|&s;ations, preparatory to the negotiation. They be|gan by &s;tating the pride of the Directory, their great offence at certain parts of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, and the humiliating apologies, di&s;avowals, repara|tions, and explanations, which would be required from the envoys. The&s;e however, they fairly avow|ed to be only pretexts for the purpo&s;e of obtaining, what was their real object, and without which, the envoys were told, that they could expect no treaty nor even a reception, nor permi&s;&s;ion to remain in Paris; money! that with or without the&s;e apolo|gies, &amp;c. money mu&s;t be given. They mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, give to the mini&s;ter about 223,000 dollars, to be employed by him in gaining the good will of the Directory. They mu&s;t advance to the French government a &s;um equal to all the American claims again&s;t France, and the French government would then pay the claimants, and they lay out the money again in &s;upplies to the French colonies. They mu&s;t purcha&s;e from the French government Dutch debts to the amount of about &s;ix millions of dollars, as &s;ometimes &s;tated, and twelve million of

All this was to be done without any a&s;&s;urance, that a negotiation would be &s;ucce&s;s|ful, without any &s;tatement of terms, and perhaps without even a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities. The&s;e terms the envoys po&s;itively rejected. Argument and menace were exerted in vain, to produce a compliance.&mdash;The wrath and power of the French government was &s;et forth in &s;trong terms. It was &s;tated that the pre&s;ent Directors would probably not be long in power, and a temporary compliance might prevent a war. That we had to treat with men who di&s;regarded the ju&s;tice of our claims, and the rea&s;oning with which we &s;upported them: that they di&s;regarded their own colonies, and con&s;ider|ed them&s;elves as invulnerable with re&s;pect to us; that we would acquire an intere&s;t among them on|ly by a judicious application of money; that nothing was to be obtained there without money; and that all the neighbouring &s;tates had, in like manner, been obliged to purcha&s;e peace. That if we did not, they would confi&s;cate our property, and em|bargo our ve&s;&s;els and ravage our coa&s;ts; that we might look for the fate of Venice, to be parcelled out, and bartered away; or at lea&s;t have the form of our government changed, as that of Hamburgh and Switzerland would &s;oon be; or partake of a like ruin as was hanging over Portugal and England.

All this the Pre&s;ident has announced to Congre&s;s, with a declaration, that no pro&s;pect remains of accommodating our differences with France, without a &s;urrender of the e&s;&s;ential princi|ples of our independence.</P>
<P>The cri&s;is to which the United States are now brought, is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary to be found in the hi&s;tory of nations. A &s;overeign &s;tate con&s;cious of no offence is cau&s;ele&s;sly attacked by a proud and potent nation, and on pretexts as various as they are groundle&s;s, and every day &s;hifting and multiplying, is &s;poiled of property to a va&s;t amount, and threatened with the utter extinction of her trade and her means of defence. De&s;irous to avoid war, and to live on good terms with her &s;poiler, &s;he &s;ends to him me&s;&s;engers of peace, to di&s;cu&s;s the cau&s;es and effects of her &s;ufferings, and even to forgive all that is pa&s;t, on condition that &s;he may live &s;ecurely in future. The&s;e me&s;&s;engers, the &s;poiler fir&s;t refu&s;es to hear, drives from him, and threatens with impri&s;onment.&mdash;They are &s;ent back. They are &s;till not &s;uffered to unfold their complaints, or the powers of their mi&s;&s;ion. Frivo|lous grounds of complaint again&s;t the &s;uffering &s;tate are fabricated. Submi&s;&s;ions are required, on purpo&s;e to mark their degradation, and &s;hew how
<PB N="30" REF="033269_0029_0FF6B2E66D7158B8">far the &s;poiler might proceed in his plunder and demands. Tho&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions are acknowledged to be mere pretexts for exacting further enormous &s;ums of money, as bribes or loans, to men who profe&s;&s;ed no regard to ju&s;tice, and might &s;oon be out of authority. When all the&s;e terms were to be complied with, it was po&s;&s;ible the me&s;&s;engers might be admitted to &s;tate their complaints, and propo&s;e terms of redre&s;s; but in the mean time the &s;poiler would proceed in his acts of violence.</P>
<P>That when the colonies &s;ent petitions for redre&s;s to Britain, they were received contemptuou&s;ly, was not matter of great wonder; for they were held as in a &s;tate of rebellion. But that when one &s;ove|reign &s;tate, having received unexampled and un|provoked injuries from another, has &s;ent amba&s;&s;a|dors to di&s;cu&s;s the grounds of injury, and means of redre&s;s, tho&s;e amba&s;&s;adors are treated contemp|tuou&s;ly, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed unheard; and are moreover told, that if ever they be heard, it &s;hall be after a &s;urrender of national dignity, independence, and &s;elf-government, and a great increa&s;e of their pa&s;t damage, is a degree of in&s;olence, and a contempt of ju&s;tice, rarely experienced in the annals of the world. The nation that can impo&s;e &s;uch terms has no principle to re&s;train it. The nation that can &s;ubmit to them is prepared for all oppre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="31" REF="033269_0030_0FF6B2E8A35735F0">Force only can decide between them; or the one mu&s;t be a tyrant and the other a &s;lave.</P>
<P>The di&s;patches are in the hands of every one, and no hone&s;t American but mu&s;t burn with indig|nation at their in&s;olent demand of conce&s;&s;ions for the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech. Shall they impudently in|terfere in the di&s;cretionary admini&s;tration of our government, not affecting them, and we not &s;peak with re&s;entment! Shall we pave the way to a ne|gociation by a di&s;avowal of truth, and a profe&s;&s;ion of fal&s;ehood! O! if they had found the envoys ba&s;e enough to &s;ubmit to the&s;e terms, there would have been no humiliation &s;o great that would not have been required of them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were but pretexts. The real prelimi|nary was money. Money in bribes and in gifts under the name of loans. For a loan from a weaker to a more powerful government is but ano|ther name for a gift or tribute; e&s;pecially when the government requiring the money is avowed to have no regard to ju&s;tice, is publicly compared to the Indians and Algerines, and declared like them to <HI>&s;ell</HI> peace and forbearance of their cruel aggre&s;|&s;ions. With &s;uch a government having made one conce&s;&s;ion, would there have been any end of de|mand, while we had any thing to give? Indeed, at once they avow, that their expectations are in pro|portion
<PB N="32" REF="033269_0031_0FF6B2EB5A4E7388">to our ability to pay. The fir&s;t conce&s;&s;ion was putting our necks under their feet. And true intere&s;t, as well as true dignity, required that we &s;hould &s;top at the point of right.</P>
<P>But would it not have been better to have made this conce&s;&s;ion? By no means. When a govern|ment di&s;avows any regard to ju&s;tice, declares that nothing is to be obtained from it without money; not pretending any claim of right, like Indians and Algerines, &s;ets out on the principle of general plunder and exaction; and fairly owns that her demands will be mea&s;ured by our means of &s;atis|fying them; we can never hope, by any conce&s;|&s;ions, to &s;top exaction, while we have any thing to give: e&s;pecially when the men whom we &s;hould now glut with our tribute might be out of power in a few weeks, and a new &s;et not le&s;s ravenous and more hungry than they, on new pretences, and with the &s;ame terrors, might demand new &s;upplies. Our envoys had no a&s;&s;urance, if all the demands were complied with, how the money could be di&s;po&s;ed of, or what terms, or whether any terms of accommo|dation would be accorded to them. Nor, if they had received &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, could any confidence be placed in it: for whenever in mutual tran&s;ac|tions, the ba&s;is of right, ju&s;tice, and mutual intere&s;t is departed from, all confidence is gone; the party exacting what is not founded on this ba&s;is, becomes
<PB N="33" REF="033269_0032_0FF6B2ED9BEE92E0">a knave, and if he have power, a tyrant; and the party yielding, lays him&s;elf at his feet, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to whatever, is required of him. Be&s;ides, no conce&s;&s;ion from us can &s;ave us from her aggre&s;|&s;ions, while &s;he is at war with England. For it is the ruin of England that &s;he &s;eeks, and her plun|dering us is one of her means of accompli&s;hing that main object. And if we make the conce&s;&s;ions required, while Britain is at war with France, we &s;hall certainly draw on our&s;elves a war with Bri|tain.</P>
<P>But &s;till would it not be better for us, by not re|&s;i&s;ting, to avoid a war with France?</P>
<P>What tho&s;e men mean who, &s;peaking of our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation with re&s;pect to France, talk of avoid|ing war, or of keeping out of war, I have never been able to comprehend, unle&s;s they mean, that we ought to permit France in peace, to take all our &s;eamen, our &s;hips, and our property by piece meal; unmole&s;ted in peace, to reduce us to a &s;tate of &s;tarving beggars; and then, when we have no means of defence, if &s;he think proper, to come in peace and cut our throats, parcel out our lands among her &s;oldiers, and give up our wives and children to their lu&s;ts. This &s;eems to be the dar|ling peace of tho&s;e men. No re&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s our territory be invaded. Let France go on and
<PB N="34" REF="033269_0033_0FF6B2EF5DD38F20">take our &s;hips, our &s;eamen, and our wealth; it is true, that will deprive us of all means of &s;elf-de|fence, &s;top our agriculture, manufactures, and arts; but then we &s;hall be at peace. If, indeed, France ever invade our country, then we &s;hall go to war; and if then we be incapable of defence, and can procure neither arms, cloathing, nor provi&s;ions, we may con&s;ole our&s;elves with the reflection, that we have &s;acrificed all the&s;e to peace; and in peace &s;ur|render our lives, property, liberty, and indepen|dence to the French, and again &s;it down under the ble&s;&s;ings of a colonial government.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay France is too good for us to fear any &s;uch fate from her. Is not this the fate that all the &s;tates which &s;he has cur&s;ed with her protection or inva&s;ion have experienced? Has &s;he not in all of them &s;tirred up troubles, di&s;contents, commotions, &s;editions, and in&s;urrections, and, under the pretence of aiding, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, or pu|ni&s;hing the in&s;urgents, reduced them to implicit &s;ubjection to her will. What are Spain, Holland, the Italian kingdoms and republics, Switzerland, Rome, Flanders, and great part of Germany, but colonies or dominions of France, plundered of their wealth and reduced to poverty? What is Venice, a neutral nation over-run by the arms of France, re|ceived under her protection, and promi&s;ed a demo|cratic form of government, incited to commotion
<PB N="35" REF="033269_0034_0FF6B2F20FF7FB70">reduced to the condition of a conquered country, plundered of her fleet and wealth, era&s;ed from the li&s;t of nations, and bartered to the Emperor. France was not too good to do all this to Venice: and this is the nation with who&s;e fate we are now threatened by France.</P>
<P>France has long been carrying on war again&s;t us, in the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual way for her, and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to us; a war on her &s;ide, and peace on ours. It is now upwards of five years &s;ince &s;he began it.&mdash;From &s;lender beginnings, &s;he has proceeded to extravagant degrees of &s;polia|tion, extended the extravagance of her pretexts and plunder, according to the degree of our pa|tience. The government remon&s;trated; but the French government knew they dared not re|&s;ent. They had a party among our&s;elves &s;trong enough to defeat all the energy of our govern|ment, and they might &s;afely proceed to any mea&s;ure of oppre&s;&s;ion. In this party they yet confide; and in this confidence threaten us not only with further plunder, but with ruin. And unle&s;s we &s;hew them by an open and unanimous approbation of the pa&s;t, and confidence in the fu|ture conduct of our admini&s;tration; that we are determined to &s;upport our government in a ju&s;t re&s;entment, they will proceed in their &s;poliation, extending the extravagance of their pretences and

<P>This is the only kind of war that France can carry on again&s;t us, with any pro&s;pect of accom|pli&s;hing her object, and &s;ubjecting us to her will. While &s;he continues this war, and we continue our delu&s;ive peace, our ruin is as certain, as will be our &s;ecurity, if we now fix our foot and &s;ay, <HI>We will yield no more.</HI> Here we take our &s;tand, and from this moment we will repel all aggre&s;&s;ions. We will no longer &s;eek &s;helter under the influence of a foreign government, but under the parental guardian&s;hip of our own. And the authority of our own government we will maintain, or peri&s;h with it.</P>
<P>But is there any hope, that we &s;hall &s;ucceed in our re&s;i&s;tance? Whether there be or not, our con|dition can hardly be wor&s;e. For, under the la&s;t decree of France, hardly any of our &s;hips will e&s;|cape condemnation, if they choo&s;e to take them; and their di&s;po&s;ition to take them we cannot doubt. And as their re&s;entment is violent again&s;t Britain, and our de&s;truction would injure that nation, we can hardly doubt that after rendering us defence|le&s;s, they will &s;eek to de&s;troy us.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033269_0036_0FF6B2F695DB7198">
But there is hope that re&s;i&s;tance will be &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and obtain us peace, at lea&s;t, if not ju&s;tice. France has now nothing to fear, while we acquie&s;ce in her violence; but if we re&s;i&s;t we may repel, and even revenge, if not remedy it. While we can maintain a tolerable portion of &s;hipping and com|merce, we can obtain &s;uch &s;upplies, as will enable us to &s;upport our&s;elves again&s;t an inva&s;ion, if it &s;hould be attempted.&mdash;But we are at &s;uch a di&s;|tance from France, and &s;uch is the crippled &s;tate of her navy, that it is not likely that &s;he will attempt an inva&s;ion of us, while &s;he is at war with Britain, or if &s;he do attempt it, it is not likely that it can be &s;ucce&s;sful. If there be a pro&s;pect of an European peace, France mu&s;t depend, for her future great|ne&s;s, on her manufactures, commerce, and &s;hip|ping. The&s;e only can make her a rival to Bri|tain. And, to &s;upport the&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t have a fo|reign market. America is one of the mo&s;t im|portant markets in the world for European manu|factures. If the French government find, that they can no longer maintain their influence here, by a di|vi&s;ion or party among the people again&s;t the go|vernment, and find, that the people unite with the government in ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t them for their cruel and unprovoked aggre&s;&s;ions; they mu&s;t have lo&s;t all prudence, if they do not &s;ee that a continuance of injury will rivet indelible preju|dices again&s;t them in the American mind, and
<PB N="38" REF="033269_0037_0FF6B2F846B4DF88">di&s;appoint all hope of &s;ecuring any tolerable &s;hare of trade with us; and they mu&s;t have lo&s;t all re|gard for the future glory of their nation, and all re&s;entment again&s;t Britain, if they do not change their conduct towards us, and, endeavour to conci|liate our affections.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds, it appears that France has long been carrying on an in&s;idious and de&s;tructive war again&s;t us; that &s;he will continue this kind of war, in proportion to our patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, until &s;he has fir&s;t di&s;abled, and then ruined and &s;ubjected us; that there is no other way of obtain|ing an end to this war, peace, and ju&s;tice, but by re&s;i&s;tance; and that a &s;tate of re&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch war is more advantageous to us, than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and will be effectual to procure us peace, ju&s;tice, and national independence.</P>
<P>It is therefore the duty of the government, hav|ing offered all rea&s;onable terms, and exhau&s;ted all means of reconciliation, to prepare the nation for a &s;tate of &s;elf-defence; and to convince France, that we will no longer &s;ubmit to unju&s;t depredations, and violent inva&s;ions of our rights of property and &s;overeignty. War is a dreadful calamity. But in &s;elf-defence, it becomes a duty both for nations and individuals. And a government, which &s;uffers ano|ther government unju&s;tly and without re&s;i&s;tance, to
<PB N="39" REF="033269_0038_0FF6B2FAF3CFFE08">exhau&s;t it by plunder, and render it defencele&s;s, thereby to ruin and en&s;lave it, is like a man who quietly &s;uffers a robber to tie his hands and bleed him to death, thereby to &s;eize his property.</P>
<P>The people al&s;o have duties to perform. When an independent and free nation has its &s;overeign rights attacked, and violated by another nation; it is a call of Providence to all the citizens to &s;tand forth, and defend the cau&s;e of truth and national liberty. Union in re&s;i&s;tance becomes as much a duty in all the citizens, as it is the duty of all the members of a family to unite in defence of the hou&s;e again&s;t midnight a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins or incendiaries. And in the di&s;charge of this duty, to which Provi|dence calls them, they ought to look up with holy confidence to the protection of that Providence which calls them out to trial, and to the &s;trength of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who calls them to battle. His providence and &s;trength America hath hereto|fore experienced: and the Lord, which delivered us out of the paw of the lion, will deliver us out of the hand of the Phili&s;tine.</P>
<P>To a tru&s;t in God we ought to unite confidence in tho&s;e men whom Providence hath called to rule over us. We &s;ee that the conduct of the Pre&s;ident and his council has been virtuous, liberal and en|lightened; that he has done every thing practicable
<PB N="40" REF="033269_0039_0FF6B2FD2BB83708">to avoid war; and that war is brought and conti|nued on us, by the malice and inju&s;tice of our ene|mies. Tho&s;e &s;landers with which ba&s;e men have ob&s;cured the light, truth, and wi&s;dom of our go|vernment, have been cha&s;ed away like mi&s;ts before the &s;un. Let us return therefore from our error. Let us re&s;tore to our admini&s;tration that confidence which never ought to have been withdrawn. And as our enemies have taken advantage of our jea|lou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions of our government, and made the divi&s;ions ari&s;ing from them, grounds of their pre&s;umptuous hopes of de&s;troying us; let us re|move this cau&s;e of danger, if we would avoid the danger it&s;elf. Let us &s;hew, that the people and the government are of one heart and one mind. United we &s;tand: divided we fall.</P>
<P>As, to remove danger, we mu&s;t remove divi&s;ions, jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions, &s;o to remove the&s;e, we mu&s;t &s;ilence &s;landerers, and &s;et our faces again&s;t them. We have &s;een the &s;ad effects, and the gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of tho&s;e lying new&s;papers, lying pamphlets, lying letters, and lying conver&s;ations, with which the country has been filled. It is no longer a &s;ea|&s;on to trifle with public opinion or popular pa&s;&s;ion; le&s;t God give us up to &s;trong delu&s;ion, and &s;uffer us to fall into de&s;truction. Let us turn a deaf ear to tho&s;e lying prophets. Let us withdraw from them all belief, all aid, and all countenance. They
<PB N="41" REF="033269_0040_0FF6B2FF60DA56E0">are vipers in our bo&s;om, vultures preying on our bowels, and fatal in&s;truments of the malicious pur|po&s;es of our enemies. No good man, with a ju&s;t regard to his own reputation, will any longer &s;up|port or countenance them, for, by doing &s;o, he gives them confidence, and enables them to be mi&s;|chievous. Silence tho&s;e &s;landerers, and we &s;hall be as happy as we are free, as united as we are happy, and as formidable as we are united.</P>
<P>Finally, in order to remove the danger thereby threatened, it is our duty to endeavour to remove that impre&s;&s;ion, which our divi&s;ions have made on the French government. As they re&s;t their hopes of injuring us on the belief that there is a party among our&s;elves devoted to their will; let us &s;hew them that there is no &s;uch party. Let us unite in one band of unity among our&s;elves, and confidence in our admini&s;tration; and, to te&s;tify this union and confidence to the world, let us unanimou&s;ly &s;ign an in&s;trument, expre&s;&s;ing to our government our con|fidence in the rectitude of its mea&s;ures, our firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, for the &s;upport of our independence from a foreign yoke, on this as on a former occa&s;ion; and, for this &s;upport, now as then, pledging to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our &s;acred honour.</P>
