<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS</HI> an unexpected and plea&s;ing circum&s;tance has recently taken place in the annals of the <HI>NEW JERUSALEM CHURCH,</HI> in this city, by the conviction and addition of a few members, amongst whom are the learned, the pious, and reverend. And as this &s;ingu|lar event has promoted a laudible &s;pirit of inquiry amongst different &s;ects and denominations of chri&s;tians, who are earne&s;t inquirers after truth; &s;o that more applications have been made to many members of that Church, here, for the loan of books on their peculiar doctrines, than they were able to grant.&mdash;It was judg|ed a duty, at a meeting of the repre&s;entatives of &s;aid Church, to cau&s;e a number of copies of the following pamphlet to be printed, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who wi&s;h to &s;ee and read a brief but fair &s;tatement of the leading doctrines which are taught in that Church might have an opportunity of being gratified.</P>
<P>We have thought proper, however, to prefix to this little work a brief account of the honorable herald of this new di&s;pen&s;ation, (as <HI>WE</HI> believe it to be) in a letter written by him&s;elf to, and at the &s;pecial reque&s;t of a reverend and learned friend.</P>
<P>A compendious view of the particular doctrines which are maintained through his voluminous writ|ings, are next &s;ubmitted to con&s;ideration: and thirdly, the mo&s;t leading and principal of the&s;e doctrines are attempted to be defended. Should the public look with &s;uitable approbation on this fir&s;t little offering, we &s;hall proceed by a &s;econd and immediate attempt to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, and &s;trew &s;ome &s;cientific and plea&s;ing in|&s;tructions amongst our more &s;erious di&s;qui&s;itions, as a rich &s;upply is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be an allowed maxim, (as, we believe, few will deny,) that <HI>an error in judgment will occa|&s;ion an error in practice,</HI> then it is a duty incumbent on every per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian name, to examine well tho&s;e principles which have been in|&s;tilled into him from infancy, and &s;ee how far they are con&s;i&s;tent, or incon&s;i&s;tent, with the true &s;en&s;e of the holy word, and the dictates of &s;ound rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But when is this inve&s;tigation to commence? and what are the preliminary conditions of &s;etting it on foot? We an&s;wer, Now is the time; <HI>now it is allowable</HI> for every man to exerci&s;e his rational faculties, and no longer &s;uffer him&s;elf to be hood|winked or en&s;laved, either by the prejudice of edu|cation, or the &s;hackles of a blind faith. And we conceive no other preliminary is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ave this, That we admit we <HI>may</HI> heretofore have been educated in fal&s;e principles, and are now re&s;olved to &s;eek truth for the &s;ake of truth.</P>
<P>As to the objection which &s;ome may make again&s;t the doctrines of the New Church, viz. <HI>that they are new,</HI> we have only to remark, that it is a matter of &s;mall moment, whether a thing be <HI>new</HI> or <HI>old:</HI> the great que&s;tion with us is, Whether they be <HI>true</HI> or not? And we tru&s;t, every reader will join with us in opinion, that a thing once di&s;cover|ed
<PB N="vi" REF="033549_0005_0FF78814314A1E48">
to be <HI>true in it&s;elf,</HI> ought never to be rejected merely on account of it's novelty. But what if the&s;e &s;ame doctrines of the New Church &s;hall be proved to be the invariable language both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, when under&s;tood in their true and proper &s;en&s;e? Will tho&s;e, who object to <HI>novelty,</HI> in this ca&s;e &s;ubmit to the authority of <HI>an|tiquity?</HI> If &s;o, our endeavors &s;hall not be wanting to confirm the truths of the New Jeru&s;alem, by a fair appeal to that te&s;timony which every chri&s;tian is &s;uppo&s;ed to admit.</P>

<HEAD>Authentic Copy of a Letter from the <HI>Hon. EMANUEL SWEDENBORG</HI> to the <HI>Rev. THOMAS HARTLEY,</HI> late Rector of Winwick, in Northampton&s;hire.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I TAKE plea&s;ure in the friend&s;hip you expre&s;s for me in your letter, and return you thanks for the &s;ame; but as to the prai&s;es therein, I con|&s;ider them as belonging to the truths contained in my writings, and &s;o refer them to the Lord our Saviour as his due, who is in him&s;elf the fountain of all truth. It is the concluding part of your let|ter that chiefly engages my attention, where you &s;ay as follows: <Q>As, after your departure from England, di&s;putes may ari&s;e on the &s;ubject of your writings, and &s;o give occa&s;ion to defend their author again&s;t &s;uch fal&s;e reports and a&s;per|&s;ions, as they who are no friends to truth may invent to the prejudice of his reputation, may it not be of u&s;e, in order to repel any calumnies of that kind, that you leave behind you &s;ome &s;hort account of your&s;elf, as concerning, for example, your degrees in the univer&s;ity, the offices you have borne, your family, and connections, the honors which I am told have been conferred up|on you, and &s;uch other particulars as may &s;erve to the vindication of your character, if attacked, that &s;o any ill-grounded prejudices may be obvi|ated or removed; for where the honour and in|tere&s;t of truth are concerned, it certainly be|hoves us to employ all lawful methods in its de|fence and &s;upport.</Q> After reflecting on the foregoing pa&s;&s;age, I was induced to comply with
<PB N="viii" REF="033549_0007_0FF78819A0AF33E8">
your friendly advice, by briefly communicating the following circum&s;tances of my life.</P>
<P>I was born at Stockholm in the year of our Lord 1689, January 29. My father's name was Je&s;per Swedberg, who was Bi&s;hop of We&s;t-Go|thia, and of a celebrated character in his time: He was al&s;o a member of the Society for the Pro|pagation of the Go&s;pel, formed on the model of that in England, and appointed Pre&s;ident of the Swedi&s;h Churches in Penn&s;ylvania, and London, by Charles XII. In the year 1710, I began my travels, fir&s;t into England, and afterwards into Holland, France, and Germany, and returned home in 1714. In the year 1716, and afterwards, I frequently conver&s;ed with Charles XII. King of Sweden, who was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on me a large &s;hare of his favour, and in that year appoint|ed me to the office of A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in the Metallic College, in which office I continued from that time till the year 1747, when I quitted the office, but &s;till retain the &s;alary annexed to it as an ap|pointment for life. The rea&s;on of my withdraw|ing from the bu&s;ine&s;s of that employment was, that I might be more at liberty to apply my&s;elf to that new function to which the Lord had called me. About this time a place of higher dignity in the &s;tate was offered me, which I declined to accept, le&s;t it &s;hould prove a &s;nare to me. In 1719, I was ennobled by Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and named Swedenborg, from which time I have taken my &s;eat with the Nobles of the Eque&s;trian order, in the Triennial A&s;&s;emblies of the States. I am a Fellow, by invitation, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, but have never de&s;ired to be of any other community, as I belong to the So|ciety
<PB N="ix" REF="033549_0008_0FF7881B63B167C8">
of Angels, in which things &s;piritual and heavenly are the only &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e and entertainment; whereas in our literary &s;ocieties, the attention is wholly taken up with things relat|ing to the body and this world. In the year 1734, I publi&s;hed the <HI>Regnum Minerale,</HI> at Lep&s;ie, in Three Volumes, Folio; and in 1738, I took a journey into Italy, and &s;taid a year at Venice and Rome.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my family connections: I had four &s;i&s;ters; one of them was married to Eric Benzelius, afterwards made Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al; and thus I became related to the two &s;ucceeding Archbi&s;hops of that &s;ee, both named Benzelius, and younger brothers of the former. Another of my &s;i&s;ters was married to Lars Benzel&s;tierna, who was promoted to a provincial government; but the&s;e are both dead: however, two bi&s;hops who are related to me, are &s;till living; one of them is named Filenius, Bi&s;hop of O&s;trogothia, who now officiates as Pre&s;ident of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or|der in the General A&s;&s;embly at Stockholm, in the room of the Archbi&s;hop who is infirm: he mar|ried the daughter of my &s;i&s;ter: the other, who is called Benzel&s;tierna, Bi&s;hop of We&s;tmannia and Dalecarnia, is the &s;on of my &s;econd &s;i&s;ter; not to mention others of my family who are dignified. I conver&s;e freely, and am in friend&s;hip with all the Bi&s;hops of my country, who are ten in number, and al&s;o with the &s;ixteen Senators, and the re&s;t of the grandees, who love and honor me, as know|ing that I am in fellow&s;hip with Angels. The King and Queen them&s;elves, as al&s;o the three Princes their &s;ons, &s;hew me all kind countenance, and I was once invited to eat with the King and
<PB N="x" REF="033549_0009_0FF7881F35AC0D20">
Queen at their table, (an honor granted only to the Peers of the realm,) and likewi&s;e &s;ince that with the Hereditary Prince.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent King of Sweden.</NOTE> All in my own coun|try wi&s;h for my return home, &s;o far am I from the lea&s;t danger of per&s;ecution there, as you &s;eem to apprehend, and are al&s;o &s;o kindly &s;olicitous to provide again&s;t; and &s;hould any thing of that kind befal me el&s;ewhere, it will give me no concern.</P>
<P>Whatever of worldly honor and advantage may appear to be in the things before-mentioned, I hold them but as matters of low e&s;timation, when compared to the honor of that holy office to which the Lord him&s;elf hath called me, who was graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to manife&s;t him&s;elf to me his unwor|thy &s;ervant, in a per&s;onal appearance, in the year 1743, to open me a &s;ight of the Spiritual World, and to enable me to conver&s;e with Spirits and Angels, and this privilege hath continued with me to this day. From that time I began to print and publi&s;h various unknown Arcana, that have been either &s;een by me or revealed to me, con|cerning Heaven and Hell, the &s;tate of men after death, the true wor&s;hip of God, the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of the Scriptures, and many other important truths tending to &s;alvation and true wi&s;dom: and that mankind might receive benefit from the&s;e communications, was the only motive which has induced me at different times to leave my home to vi&s;it other countries. As to this world's wealth, I have what is &s;ufficient, and more I neither &s;eek nor wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Your letter has drawn the mention of the&s;e things from me, in ca&s;e, as you &s;ay, they may be a means to prevent or remove any fal&s;e judgment or wrong prejudices with regard to my per&s;onal
<PB N="xi" REF="033549_0010_0FF7882226F23ED0">
circum&s;tances. Farewel; and I heartily wi&s;h you pro&s;perity both in things &s;piritual and temporal, of which I make no doubt, if &s;o be you go on to pray to our Lord, and to &s;et him always before you.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee what different judgments will be formed by different per&s;ons concerning the above letter, particularly that part of it, where he opens his &s;piritual commi&s;&s;ion, and declares him&s;elf the Apo&s;tle of a new Di&s;pen&s;ation. The athei&s;t and infidel will regard the things contained in it as im|po&s;&s;ible, and will in&s;tantly reject it under that idea: the wit and the minute philo&s;opher will ri|dicule it as extravagant, and pronounce it the mere effect of a warm and deluded imagination: even the &s;erious and well-di&s;po&s;ed chri&s;tian will have his doubts concerning it's reality, and will &s;u&s;pect the fact, though he will not di&s;pute it's po&s;&s;ibility. Supernatural events, in all ages of the world, have thus divided the &s;entiments of man|kind, nor is it to be expected that in our own age we &s;hall be better agreed touching the truth of a relation &s;o marvellous and miraculous, &s;upported only by the te&s;timony of a &s;ingle witne&s;s. Caution likewi&s;e, on &s;uch occa&s;ions has always been deem|ed expedient by the truly good and enlightened, le&s;t giving too ha&s;ty an a&s;&s;ent to things extraordi|nary, they &s;hould encourage impo&s;ture, and put it in the power of weak or ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons to e&s;tabli&s;h an authority over the minds of others, grounded only in the infirmities or depravities of their own.</P>
<P>But as an indi&s;criminate reception of every &s;u|pernatural
<PB N="xii" REF="033549_0011_0FF78824D023D600">
relation is dangerous, &s;o an indi&s;crimi|nate rejection is no le&s;s &s;o, and is therefore equally to be avoided by all wi&s;e men. Candour to exa|mine, and judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h between truth and error, between realities and appearances, have for this rea&s;on at all times been accounted e&s;tima|ble virtues; whereby the upright and &s;incere might be pre&s;erved from the mi&s;chiefs attending a blind credulity on the one &s;ide, and a perver&s;e incredulity on the other.</P>
<P>We beg leave therefore to &s;ugge&s;t, with all de|ference to the &s;entiments of others, that it is the duty of every candid chri&s;tian &s;o examine well the credibility of the above te&s;timony, and this with|out partiality and without prejudice, ina&s;much as the general intere&s;ts of truth, which ought to be dear to every one, may be greatly affected by &s;uch an examination. And as the tenor of Baron Swe|denborg's life, dated from the above event, to his death, together with his writings and the doctrines therein contained, mu&s;t needs have great and de|&s;erved weight in the determination of an impartial judgment; it appears, farther, to be the duty of every &s;incere inquirer after the truth, not to pro|nounce any &s;entence, till he has faithfully and dili|gently weighed the &s;everal circum&s;tances re&s;pect|ing the latter period of our author's life, as well as the nature and tendency of the books written by him during that period.</P>
<P>It is well known that Baron Swedenborg, after the above extraordinary call to be an in&s;tructor of mankind, dedicated him&s;elf entirely to the great work which was a&s;&s;igned him. The future part of his life was &s;pent, agreeably to the high commi&s;&s;i|on he had received, in &s;tudying diligently the
<PB N="xiii" REF="033549_0012_0FF7882685C376C0">
Word of God, in opening and elucidating the great truths therein contained, and in publi&s;hing them to his fellow-creatures, together with the im|portant information made known to him concern|ing another world. For this purpo&s;e he frequent|ly left his native country to vi&s;it di&s;tant cities, par|ticularly London and Am&s;terdam, where all his Theological works were printed by him at a great expence, and with little pro&s;pect or probability of a reimbur&s;ement. Wherever he re&s;ided on his travels, (according to the te&s;timony of a late writer, who was per&s;onally acquainted with him) he was a mere &s;olitary, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, through in his own country of a free and open behaviour. He affected no honor, but declined it; pur&s;ued no worldly intere&s;t, but &s;pent his time in travelling and printing, in order to communicate in&s;truction and benefit to mankind. He had nothing of the preci&s;ian in his manner, nothing of melancholy in his temper, and nothing in the lea&s;t bordering on enthu&s;ia&s;m in his conver&s;ation or writings. To this may be added, that he affected no &s;ingularities, neither was he elated by rea&s;on of his extraordina|ry gifts, &s;o as to aim at any preheminence in &s;pi|ritual things, or to &s;et him&s;elf up as the head of a party. Far from the &s;pirit of a &s;ectarian, he loved good men wherever he found them, and approved the truth by whom&s;oever it was taught; neverthe|le&s;s he was bold and free to cen&s;ure vice under all it's forms, and among&s;t all its adherents; and to point out errors, how&s;oever re&s;pectable the names which gave them authority. In &s;hort, his whole life, from the date of the above memorable event, appears to have been that of a man called to emi|nent and extraordinary &s;ervices; being orderly,
<PB N="xiv" REF="033549_0013_0FF78829472C9FC8">
prudent, pure, humble, and beneficent, &s;uitable to the heavenly intercour&s;e to which he was ad|mitted.</P>
<P>He died at London, in the year 1772; and, after lying in &s;tate, was interred at the Swedi&s;h Church, near Ratcliff-Highway.</P>

<HEAD>A Compendious <HI>VIEW</HI> of the principal <HI>DOCTRINES</HI> of the <HI>NEW CHURCH,</HI> otherwi&s;e called the <HI>NEW JERUSALEM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT being the avowed purpo&s;e of this Publicati|on to furni&s;h the reader with an ab&s;tract of a new, but rational &s;y&s;tem of divinity, it becomes us to &s;tate, in a fair and candid manner, tho&s;e principles which we conceive to be founded in truth, and which, we tru&s;t, will meet the appro|bation of every intelligent and impartial reader.</P>
<P>The New Church is &s;o called, becau&s;e it is that &s;ignified by the New Jeru&s;alem in the Revelation of John.</P>
<P>Emanuel Swedenborg, the founder of this New Church, who&s;e tenets are peculiarly di&s;tinct from every other &s;y&s;tem of divinity in Chri&s;tendom, draws all his doctrines from the holy &s;criptures, which appear at the &s;ame time to be grounded in true philo&s;ophy. The author points out an intire new and &s;ingular way of reconciling the apparent contradictions in &s;cripture, by having recour&s;e to two kinds of truth, which he di&s;tingui&s;hes into ge|nuine and apparent. He maintains, that the holy &s;cripture, as well as every thing in nature, is re|&s;olvable into one or the other of the&s;e two kinds
<PB N="xv" REF="033549_0014_0FF7882CCA2D7030">
of truth. Thus when it is &s;aid, that the &s;un ri&s;es or &s;ets, this is only an apparent truth, as the genu|ine truth is, that the earth revolves round its own axis, and cau&s;es that appearance: yet there is no impropriety in &s;peaking according to appearances; nay, it would be a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity, in the above in&s;tance, to &s;peak in common conver&s;ation accor|ding to the genuine truth. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with the &s;criptures, which are written in a &s;tyle adapted to the comprehen&s;ion of the &s;imple, and in many parts are not genuine, but apparent truths. Thus when it is &s;aid, that God is angry and revengeful, that he puni&s;hes and ca&s;ts into hell, we are to under|&s;tand, that it is man who is angry with God, and that it is man who brings puni&s;hment upon him|&s;elf, and ca&s;ts him&s;elf into hell. So in numberle&s;s other pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and particu|larly in the New Te&s;tament, where the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, are mentioned apparently as three di&s;tinct per&s;ons, (which by many is con|verted into the idea of three Gods,) whereas the genuine truth is, that there is only one God in one per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and a variety of other points, equally new and intere&s;ting, are treated very copiou&s;ly by the author in his theological works. But as they are voluminous, and many of our readers may not have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting them, we &s;hall here &s;tate the principal doctrines of the New Church, which have been collected with great care from the whole of his writings, and are con|tained in the following &s;ummary.</P>
<P N="1">1. Contrary to Unitarians, who deny, and to Trinitarians, who hold a Trinity of Per&s;ons in the Godhead, they maintain that there is a Divine Tri|nity
<PB N="xvi" REF="033549_0015_0FF7882E67C3B3E8">
in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, ju&s;t like the human Trinity in every individual man, of &s;oul, body, and operation; and that as the latter Trinity con&s;ti|tutes one man, &s;o the former Trinity con&s;titutes one Jehovah God, who is at once the Creator, Re|deemer, and Regenerator.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Jehovah God him&s;elf came down from Heaven, and a&s;&s;umed human nature for the purpo&s;e of removing hell from man, of re&s;toring the heavens to order, and of preparing the way for a new church upon earth; and that herein con&s;i&s;ts the true nature of redemption, which was effected &s;olely by the omnipotence of the Lord's divine hu|manity.</P>
<P N="3">3. They hold the notion of pardon obtained by a vicarious &s;acrifice or atonement, as a funda|mental and fatal error; but that repentance is the foundation of the church in man, that it con&s;i&s;ts in a man's ab&s;taining from all evils, becau&s;e they are &s;ins again&s;t God, &amp;c. that it is productive of regeneration, which is not an in&s;tantaneous, but a gradual work, effected by the Lord alone, through charity and faith, during man's co-operation.</P>
<P N="4">4. That man has free will in &s;piritual things, whereby he may join him&s;elf by reciprocration with the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the imputation of the merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is a thing as ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible, as it would be to impute to any man the work of creation; for the merits and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;t in redemption, which is as much the work of a divine and omnipotent Being, as creation it&s;elf. They maintain, how|ever, that the imputation, which really takes place,

<HEAD>The <HI>DOCTRINE</HI> of the <HI>TRINITY</HI> clearly &s;tated and explained.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been a mortifying reflection, that the doctrines of the Chri&s;tian religion, as they are too generally inculcated, cannot be &s;upported by a fair and candid appeal to &s;ound rationality, and to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, but that in many in&s;tances the mo&s;t orthodox theologians are compelled to &s;ubmit their under&s;tandings to a blind faith, and acquie&s;ce in doctrines that are not only above the comprehen&s;ion of man, but plainly and ab&s;olutely contradictory to &s;ound rea&s;on. Where is the divine, for in&s;tance, who can look the gene|rally received doctrine of the Trinity in the face, without (tacitly at lea&s;t) acknowledging it's ab&s;ur|dity, although he may perhaps have bound him&s;elf down to profe&s;s it as the leading article of his faith? If a Pagan, or Mahometan, gravely repeats the ar|ticles of his belief, we &s;mile at his credulity, and wonder how a rational being can receive, as the ground work of his religion, &s;uch incredible tra|ditions. Yet Chri&s;tians in their turn equally be|come the &s;ubjects of ridicule among Mahometans and Pagans, for their &s;trange and unaccountable acknowledgment of <HI>Three Divine Per&s;ons</HI> in the
<PB N="xxi" REF="033549_0020_0FF78839D42BFC78">
Godhead; which is &s;o plain and palpable a con|fe&s;&s;ion of the exi&s;tence of <HI>Three Gods,</HI> that no &s;ubtlety of rea&s;oning can po&s;&s;ibly elude the charge.</P>
<P>This, however, is not the fault of Chri&s;tianity, but of it's profe&s;&s;ors, who have unfortunately mi&s;|taken it's mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential characters, and repre&s;ent|ed it as a religion that prohibits man the free u&s;e of his under&s;tanding: and in no article is this more con&s;picuous than in that of the Trinity. But that true Chri&s;tianity is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound rea&s;on, that the under&s;tanding of man ought freely to be exerci&s;ed in all matters of faith whatever, and that the Word of God requires no one blind|ly to believe what he cannot in &s;ome mea&s;ure com|prehend, &s;hall, we tru&s;t, be fully demon&s;trated in the cour&s;e of this work. At pre&s;ent we &s;hall con|fine our&s;elves to that great article of the Chri&s;tian faith, viz. the <HI>Divine Trinity,</HI> and &s;hew that it is &s;o far from being an inexplicable, incomprehen&s;i|ble my&s;tery, that it is perhaps the plaine&s;t, &s;imple&s;t, and mo&s;t intelligible doctrine in the whole &s;y&s;tem of theology. But this we cannot do better than in the words of Baron Swedenborg, who in his admirable work, entitled <HI>True Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> treats the &s;ubject in the following manner:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="explanation">
<HEAD><HI>EXPLANATION</HI> of the <HI>TRINITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are general, and al&s;o particular e&s;&s;enti|als of every one thing, which altogether con&s;titute one e&s;&s;ence. The general e&s;&s;entials of every one man are, his &s;oul, body, and operation; and that the&s;e con&s;titute one e&s;&s;ence, is evident from this circum&s;tance, that one exi&s;teth by derivation from the other, and for the &s;ake of the other, in a con|tinued
<PB N="xxii" REF="033549_0021_0FF7883B9BF4B148">
&s;eries; for man hath his beginning from the &s;oul, which is the very e&s;&s;ence of the &s;eed, and which is not only the initiating, but al&s;o the pro|ducing cau&s;e of all the parts of the body in their re&s;pective order, and afterwards of all acts pro|ceeding from the &s;oul and body united, which are called operations; wherefore, from this circum|&s;tance of the production of one from another, and their con&s;equent in&s;ertion and conjunction one with another, it is evident, that the&s;e three are of one e&s;&s;ence, and therefore they are called three e&s;|&s;entials.</P>
<P>That the&s;e three e&s;&s;entials, viz. &s;oul, body and operation, did, and do exi&s;t in the Lord God the Saviour, is univer&s;ally acknowledged. That his &s;oul was from Jehovah the Father, can only be de|nied by Antichri&s;t, for in the Word of both the Old and New Te&s;tament he is called the Son of Jehovah, the Son of the Mo&s;t High God, the On|ly-begotten; wherefore the divinity of the Father, an&s;wering to the &s;oul in man, is his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential. That the Son, who was born of the mother Mary, is the body of that divine &s;oul, is a con&s;equence of that birth, ina&s;much as nothing is provided in the womb of the mother except a body, conceived in her, and derived from the &s;oul; this, therefore, is a &s;econd e&s;&s;ential. That operation con&s;titue a third e&s;&s;ential, is a con&s;equence of their proceed|ing from &s;oul and body together; for the things that proceed are of the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence with the things from whence they proceed. That the three e&s;&s;en|tials, which are Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, are One in the Lord, like &s;oul, body, and operation in man, is evident from the words of the Lord, declaring that He and the Father are One, and
<PB N="xxiii" REF="033549_0022_0FF788407AB69BF0">
that the Father is in Him, and He in the Father; and that in like manner He and the Holy Gho&s;t are One, ina&s;much as the Holy Gho&s;t is the di|vine proceeding out of the Lord from the Father.</P>
<P>When it is &s;aid that Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t are three e&s;&s;entials of one God, it may ap|pear to human rea&s;on as if tho&s;e three e&s;&s;entials were three di&s;tinct per&s;ons, which yet cannot po&s;|&s;ibly be true; but when it is under&s;tood that the divinity of the Father, which con&s;tituteth the &s;oul, and the divinity of the Son, which con&s;tituteth the Body, and the divinity of the Holy Gho&s;t, or the divine-proceeding, which con&s;tituteth Opera|tion, are three e&s;&s;entials of one God, this the un|der&s;tanding can apprehend. For there is a pecu|liar divinity of nature in God the Father, in the Son derived from the Father, and in the Holy Gho&s;t proceeding from both, which being of the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence, and the &s;ame mind, con&s;titute toge|ther one God. But if tho&s;e three divine natures are called per&s;ons, and have each of them their particular attributes allotted them, as when impu|tation is a&s;cribed to the Father, mediation to the Son, and operation to the Holy Gho&s;t, in this ca&s;e the Divine E&s;&s;ence is divided, which yet is One and Individual, and thus none of the Three is God in perfect fullne&s;s, but each in &s;ubtriplicate power, which is a conceit that every &s;ober and &s;en|&s;ible man mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity reject.</P>
<P>How plain therefore is it to di&s;cern a Trinity in the Lord by a Trinity di&s;cernible in every indivi|dual man! For in every individual man there is a &s;oul, a body, and operation; and &s;o it is al&s;o with re&s;pect to the Lord, ina&s;much as in Him, as Paul &s;aith, <HI>"dwelleth all the fullne&s;s of the Godhead bodi|ly,"</HI>

Colo&s;&s;. ii. 9. Wherefore the Trinity in the Lord is divine, but in man it is human.</P>
<P>It is a fundamental doctrine of the pre&s;ent Chri&s;tian Church, on which depends every other in the whole &s;y&s;tem of modern theology, that there is a Trinity of Three Divine Per&s;ons exi&s;ting from eternity; but how plain is it to &s;ee, that in this my&s;tery, repre&s;enting Three Divine Per&s;ons, and yet but One God, and this One God not as One Per&s;on, rea&s;on hath nothing to do, but is lulled to &s;leep, &s;till compelling the mouth to &s;peak like a parrot without meaning! and when rea&s;on is laid a&s;leep, what are the words of the mouth but life|le&s;s and inanimate things? Or when the mouth &s;peaketh what the rea&s;on contradicteth, what are &s;uch words but the offspring of folly and infatua|tion.</P>
<P>That a Trinity of Divine Per&s;ons exi&s;ting from eternity, is a Trinity of Gods, appears evidently from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the Athana&s;ian Creed,&mdash; <HI>"There is one Per&s;on of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Gho&s;t; the Father is God and Lord, the Son is God and Lord, and the Holy Gho&s;t is God and Lord; neverthele&s;s, there are not three Gods, or three Lords, but one God, and one Lord; for as we are compelled by the Chri&s;tian Veri|ty to</HI> ACKNOWLEDGE <HI>every Per&s;on</HI> BY HIMSELF <HI>to be God and Lord, &s;o are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion to</HI> SAY <HI>there be three Gods or three Lords"</HI> This creed is received by the whole chri&s;tian church, and from it is derived all that at this day is known and acknowledged concerning God. Every one who readeth this creed with his eyes open may perceive, that a Trinity of Gods was the only Trinity thought of by tho&s;e who compo&s;ed
<PB N="xxv" REF="033549_0024_0FF78843C29EAF50">
the Council of Nice, whence this creed, as a po&s;t|humous birth, was introduced into the church. That a Trinity of Gods was not only thought of by the members of the Nicene Council, but that the &s;ame Trinity is &s;till received throughout all Chri&s;tendom, is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of mak|ing that creed the &s;tandard of knowledge re&s;pect|ing God, to which every one pays an implicit obe|dience. From the words of this generally receiv|ed doctrine concerning God, it is as clear and tran&s;parent to the &s;ight, as water in a cup of cry&s;tal, that there are three Per&s;ons, each whereof is Lord and God; and al&s;o, that according to Chri&s;tian Verity, men ought to confe&s;s, or acknowledge, each Per&s;on &s;ingly to be God and Lord, but that Religion, or the Catholic or Chri&s;tian Faith for|bids to &s;ay, and make mention of three Gods and three Lords; and thus that verity and religion, or truth and faith, are not one and the &s;ame thing, but two different things in a &s;tate of contrariety to each other. It is a&s;&s;erted indeed, that there are not three Gods, and three Lords, but one God, and one Lord; but this a&s;&s;ertion was plainly add|ed to obviate the cen&s;ures of mankind, and to pre|vent their being expo&s;ed to the deri&s;ion of the whole world; for who can forbear deri&s;ion on hearing of three Gods? And who doth not &s;ee a manife&s;t contradiction in this palliating a&s;&s;ertion, that although there are three Lords and three Gods, yet they are not three but one? Whereas had they &s;aid, that Divine E&s;&s;ence belongeth to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Gho&s;t, and yet there are not three Divine E&s;&s;ences, but only one individual E&s;&s;ence, the my&s;tery in this ca&s;e would have been ea&s;ily explained, whil&s;t by
<PB N="xxvi" REF="033549_0025_0FF78847A9814A38">
the Father men had under&s;tood the all-begetting Divinity, by the Son the Divine Humanity thence originating, and by the Holy Gho&s;t the Divine Proceeding, which three are con&s;tituent of one God; or if the divinity of the Father had been con&s;idered as the &s;oul of man, the Divine Huma|nity as the body of that &s;oul, and the Holy Gho&s;t as the operation proceeding from both; in this ca&s;e three e&s;&s;entials are under&s;tood as belonging to one and the &s;ame Per&s;on, and therefore as con&s;ti|tuting together one &s;ingle individual E&s;&s;ence.</P>

<HEAD>On the <HI>DOCTRINE</HI> of the <HI>ATONEMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE popular opinion re&s;pecting this doctrine is, "That the &s;acrifice and atonement made unto God for the &s;ins of mankind, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion."</P>
<P>This the members of the New Jeru&s;alem Church flatly and po&s;itively deny, and that for the follow|ing rea&s;ons:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the doctrine of Chri&s;t's atone|ment nece&s;&s;arily implies a plurality of per&s;ons in the Godhead, which has already been proved to be an irrational, blind, and ab&s;urd fiction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e it further implies, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not the <HI>only</HI> God, but that there is a Fa|ther di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to him, who breathes out vengeance again&s;t the whole human race, and cannot be reconciled to them without the unmerited &s;ufferings and cruel death of an innocent per&s;on, even of his own Son. This we
<PB N="xxvii" REF="033549_0026_0FF7884A71EB2108">
will be bold to &s;ay is repre&s;enting the God of mercy and compa&s;&s;ion as wor&s;e than Moloch him&s;elf, who was content with the &s;acrifice which his devotees made of their children, without having recource to the offspring of his own loins to gratify his in&s;a|tiate lu&s;t of blood. Yet (horrid thought!) &s;uch is the God that modern Chri&s;tians wor&s;hip, and &s;uch the grand principle of their fal&s;e theology.</P>
<P>A <HI>third</HI> rea&s;on why we deny, that faith in the &s;acrifice and atonement of Chri&s;t is the great prin|ciple of the Chri&s;tian religion, is, becau&s;e it is no where a&s;&s;erted to be &s;o in the Word of God; but on the contrary, it is the plain doctrine of &s;crip|ture, that chri&s;tianity is founded on an acknow|ledgment of one God, on faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t as that one God, and on repentance or a life accord|ing to his commandments. The&s;e are the funda|mental con&s;tituents of the chri&s;tian religion, into which the idea of vicarious &s;acrifice and atone|ment, as generally under&s;tood, cannot po&s;&s;ibly en|ter, and with which it cannot by any means be re|conciled. For if it be once admitted, that re|demption con&s;i&s;ts merely in the &s;acrifice and atonement of Chri&s;t, as a mean whereby the wrath of the Father was appea&s;ed; and if, in order to be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, man needs only to have faith in the merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Son of God; how natural is it to conclude, that actual repentance is a vain, unnece&s;&s;ary, if not a danger|ous work; &s;eeing that redemption is already fin|i&s;hed by the pa&s;&s;ion of the cro&s;s, and man's &s;alva|tion already accompli&s;hed, without the nece&s;&s;ity of his co-operation! The danger that naturally ari&s;es from &s;uch a doctrine as this, is too evident to need pointing out to any per&s;on of &s;ober reflection; for
<PB N="xxviii" REF="033549_0027_0FF7884C2F0C24C8">
thus all the precepts in the Word, relating to love and charity, to newne&s;s of life, repentance, and regeneration, would be of no more real u&s;e to man than &s;o many pages of blank paper.</P>
<P>"But," our objector will &s;ay, <Q>what then is meant by the &s;ufferings and death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If they were not to &s;atisfy the vindic|tive ju&s;tice of the Father, by bearing in his per|&s;on the puni&s;hment due to our offences: what was their end and de&s;ign?</Q> To this we an&s;wer, His &s;ufferings and death were the nece&s;&s;ary means of effecting the work of redemption, which con|&s;i&s;ted, not in any atonement for the offences of others, for it is neither agreeable to the laws of God or man that the innocent &s;hould &s;uffer for the crimes of the guilty: nor in the appea&s;ing of any wrath which God the Father entertained again&s;t the human race, for no &s;uch wrath ever exi&s;ted: but in a real &s;ubjection of the powers of darkne&s;s, tho&s;e evils &s;pirits of hell which began to predomi|nate over the whole univer&s;e. Wherefore it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pre&s;erve all things in their &s;tate of purity and happine&s;s, and to deliver the church on earth from the a&s;|&s;aults of hell, for Jehovah God him&s;elf to come down among men, to clothe him&s;elf with human nature, and in his own divine per&s;on work out re|demption. This he effected by permitting the hu|manity, which he received from the Virgin Mary, to be a&s;&s;aulted with temptations from evil &s;pirits, in which he fought again&s;t them, and by his own power conquered and put them to flight. Every external &s;uffering in his body corre&s;ponded with &s;ome internal temptation from hell, and was in fact a con&s;equence thereof; for all the &s;tripes, buffet|tings,
<PB N="xxix" REF="033549_0028_0FF77BF0DE9204F0">
and contempt he endured, and which were inflicted upon him by the Jews, did not &s;olely ori|ginate with them, but they treated him in that manner in con&s;equence of being in&s;tigated thereto by evil &s;pirits, with whom they were in &s;pirit a&s;&s;o|ciated. Hence we find him &s;ometimes rebuking the devils, and &s;ometimes their a&s;&s;ociates the Jews.</P>
<P>But the manner of fighting in &s;pirit, is different from the mode practi&s;ed by men in the natural world. When our Lord was buffetted, he did not return a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> a&s;&s;ault, and in <HI>that manner</HI> con|quer; but he with patience &s;ubmitted, either holding his peace, or &s;imply &s;aying, "Why &s;mite&s;t thou me?" Yet even this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the exter|nal corre&s;ponded to a complete victory in the in|ternal; and while a &s;ingle Jew apparently trium|phed in the fle&s;h, in the &s;pirit a whole legion of devils was put to flight. So at the time of his crucifixion, in&s;tead of delivering him&s;elf by the weapons of this world, or miraculou&s;ly coming down from the cro&s;s, he only &s;ays, "Father for|give them, for they know not what they do." Yet even then his patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the death of the cro&s;s, corre&s;ponded to his complete victory over all the powers of darkne&s;s; and (what is wonder|ful to contemplate, but incredible to the merely natural man!) the moment in which the Jewi&s;h nation vainly triumphed in the death of our Lord's <HI>material</HI> body, that very moment he glorified his Humanity, vanqui&s;hed all the ho&s;ts of hell, com|pleted his triumph over every &s;piritual enemy, and re&s;tored to the church on earth, as well as to the univer&s;al world of &s;pirits, that liberty of which they had heretofore been deprived.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="033549_0029_0FF788519D04CD70">Such then was the end and de&s;ign of all our Lord's &s;ufferings and death, and &s;uch the nature of redemption, which was effected by Jehovah him|&s;elf, who&s;e e&s;&s;ential Divinity is called the Father, who&s;e Humanity is called the Son, and who&s;e pow|erful operation is the Holy Spirit.</P>

Mediation, in|terce&s;&s;ion, and <HI>advocate&s;hip,</HI> are predicated of the Divine Humanity of the Lord, becau&s;e the Huma|nity is the <HI>medium</HI> of conjunction with the Divini|ty, ju&s;t as the body of a man is the <HI>medium</HI> whereby his &s;oul may be approached.</P>
<P>They who believe that the divine e&s;&s;ence con|&s;i&s;ts of three per&s;ons, which all together make up one God, form to them&s;elves, while reading the li|teral &s;en&s;e of the Word, no other idea of mediati|on and interce&s;&s;ion, than as if the Lord &s;at at the right hand of his Father, and conver&s;ed with him as one man conver&s;es with another; and as if he made &s;upplication to the Father on behalf of men, and thus became their <HI>advocate,</HI> pleading his own merits in &s;uffering the death of the cro&s;s, and pray|ing that he would on the&s;e con&s;iderations have mercy upon them, and pardon them. Such is the idea which every &s;imple per&s;on fir&s;t forms to him|&s;elf
<PB N="xxxi" REF="033549_0030_0FF788548083D218">
from the literal &s;en&s;e of the Word, concerning the Lord's interce&s;&s;ion and mediation. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that the literal &s;en&s;e of the Word is accommodated to the comprehen&s;ion of the &s;imple, in order thereby gradually to introduce them into genuine interior truths; for the &s;imple have no other idea of the heavenly kingdom, than as of an earthly kingdom; nor of the Father, than as of an earthly king; nor of the Lord, than as of the king's &s;on, who is heir to the crown and kingdom. That &s;uch is the idea of the &s;imple, is very evident from the notions which the apo&s;tles them&s;elves entertained of the Lord's kingdom; for they at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, like the re&s;t of the Jews, that the Lord, as being the Me&s;&s;iah, would be the greate&s;t king upon earth, and that he would exalt them above all the nations and kingdoms of the whole world. But when they heard from the Lord him|&s;elf, that his kingdom was not of this world, but in heaven, then they could not but imagine, that his kingdom in heaven was like an earthly king|dom; wherefore two of his di&s;ciples, James and John, reque&s;ted as a favor, that they might be per|mitted to &s;it, the one at his right hand, and the other at his left. On which occa&s;ion the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples, who were al&s;o de&s;irous of being great in that kingdom, began to be di&s;plea&s;ed with their two brethren, and they contended among them|&s;elves which &s;hould be the greate&s;t. Now as this idea of worldly glory was rooted in their minds, and could not be &s;uddenly extirpated, therefore the Lord an&s;wered them according to their &s;tates, and told them that they &s;hould &s;it upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael; but they knew not what the Lord meant by twelve
<PB N="xxxii" REF="033549_0031_0FF788561A269C50">
thrones, nor what by the twelve tribes of I&s;rael. See Mark x. 37, 41. Luke xxii. 24, 30. Matt. xix. 28. From all which it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what idea the di&s;ciples entertained of the Lord's mediation and interce&s;&s;ion with the Father, and whence they re|ceived it. But the man who&s;e &s;piritual eyes are opened to di&s;cern the interior things of the Word, has a very different view of the Lord's mediation and interce&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering it not like that of a Son with his Father the king, but like the Lord of the univer&s;e <HI>accommodating him&s;elf</HI> to the wants and nece&s;&s;ities of his &s;inful creatures; for He and the Father are not two but one, as he him&s;elf teaches in John xiv. 8 to 11. The rea&s;on why he is called a Mediator, Interce&s;&s;or, and <HI>Advocate,</HI> is, becau&s;e by the Son is meant Divine Truth, and by the Fa|ther Divine Good; and Mediation is effected by Divine Truth, as thereby acce&s;s is obtained to Di|vine Good; for Divine Good cannot be immedi|ately approached, being in it's nature like the in|ten&s;e fire of the &s;un: Divine truth, however, may be approached, this being like the light proceeding from the &s;un, which is the medium of communi|cation between it and man. This then is the true meaning of mediation and interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But as this is a &s;ubject of the greate&s;t importance to be clearly under&s;tood, we &s;hall take this oppor|tunity of explaining more fully why the Lord, who is e&s;&s;ential Divine Good, and the real &s;un of heaven, is called a Mediator, Interce&s;&s;or, and <HI>Ad|vocate</HI> with the Father. When the Lord was in the world, previous to his complete glorification, he was Divine Truth; wherefore he was then a Mediator, and interceded with the Father, that is, with the e&s;&s;ential Divine Good; John xiv. 16, 17.
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="033549_0032_0FF788580043C790">
Chap. xvii. 9, 15, 17. But after his Humanity was fully glorified, then he is called a Mediator and Interce&s;&s;or on this account, namely, becau&s;e no one can form an idea of the e&s;&s;ential Divinity, except under the form of a Divine Man; much le&s;s can any one be conjoined to the Divinity, except by &s;uch an idea. Whoever thinks of the Divinity without having the idea of a Divine Man, thinks indeterminately; and an indeterminate idea, or an idea that has no object or form whereon to fall and be terminated, cannot with propriety be called an idea; it is a mere vague notion, that ultimately falls into nature, and becomes like nothing, and con&s;equently has no power of effecting conjuncti|on with the Divinity either by faith or love: for all conjunction nece&s;&s;arily requires an object wherewith to be conjoined; and according to the nature and quality of the object, &s;uch is the con|junction. Hence it is that the Lord, as to his Di|vinity Humanity, is called a Mediator, Interce&s;&s;or, and <HI>Advocate;</HI> but then it is to be under&s;tood, that he mediates, intercedes, and as it were pleads with him&s;elf for mankind, and not with any Father di&s;|tinct from him&s;elf: for he and the Father are one per&s;on, like the &s;oul and body in Man.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>Mediation</HI> &s;ignifies, that the Humani|ty is the medium by which man may come to God the Father, and God the Father to man, and there|by be his teacher and guide unto &s;alvation; where|fore the Son of God, by whom is meant the Huma|nity of God the Father, is called Saviour, and on earth Je&s;us, that is, Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;ignifies perpetual mediation; for true love, whence mercy, clemency, and grace proceed, perpetually intercedeth, that is, mediat|eth
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="033549_0033_0FF78982050A6BA8">
for tho&s;e who do his commandments, and who are thereby the objects of his love.</P>
<P><HI>Expiation</HI> &s;ignifies the removal of &s;ins, into which man would ru&s;h headlong, if he approached the na|ked Jehovah uncloathed with the Humanity.</P>
<P><HI>Propitiation</HI> &s;ignifies the operation of clemency and grace, to prevent man from falling into dam|nation by &s;in, and at the &s;ame time to be a &s;ecurity again&s;t the prophanation of holine&s;s, which was &s;ignified by the propitiatory, or mercy-&s;eat, over the ark in the tabernacle.</P>
<P>It is generally acknowledged, that God &s;pake in his Word according to appearances, as when it is &s;aid that he is angry, that he avengeth, that he tempteth, that he puni&s;heth, that he ca&s;teth into hell, that he condemneth, yea, that he doth evil; when the truth is, that God is never angry with any one, that he never avengeth, tempteth, puni&s;h|eth, ca&s;teth into hell, or condemneth; &s;uch things are as far from God as hell is from heaven, and infinitely farther: wherefore they are exppre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed only to &s;ignify appearances: and &s;o al&s;o are the terms <HI>expiation, propitiation, interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>me|diation</HI> u&s;ed, but yet in a different &s;en&s;e, to expre&s;s the ways of approaching unto God, and of receiv|ing grace from God, by means of his Humanity: which terms being mi&s;under&s;tood, men have divid|ed God into three, and upon that divi&s;ion have grounded all the doctrines of the church, and thereby have fal&s;ified the Word: hence cometh <HI>the abomination of de&s;olation,</HI> foretold by the Lord in Daniel, and again in Matthew, chapter xxiv.</P>
