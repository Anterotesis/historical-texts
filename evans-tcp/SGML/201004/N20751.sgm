<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more various and oppo&s;ite than the opinions of mankind, re&s;pecting the influence and a|gency of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernal &s;pirits. Some continually throw the blame of their vices upon the poor Devil;&mdash;take their word for it, and they are on all occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions the innocent dupes to his &s;ub|tilty and malice: they repre&s;ent him as the prime agent in all their complicated &s;cenes of wickedne&s;s; and would fain per&s;uade us, that &s;o far from being the objects of our ju&s;t a|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ion, they de&s;erve all our commi&s;eration and pity. From &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">repre&s;entations one would be tempted to think, that if malicious and bu&s;y devils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id but &s;tay in their own country, mankind would be as harmle&s;s as lambs, and every &s;pecies of wickedne&s;s be &s;oon bani&s;hed from our then agreeable world.</P>
<P>Others there be who fall into the oppo&s;ite extreme, and with all their power endeavour to clear the Devil of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an|ders thrown upon him; whether he hath retained them as his advocates I pretend not to &s;ay: but they tell you that he has no hand in all the wickedne&s;s committed under the &s;un; that it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have any influence on the minds and manners of men. Nay, &s;ome go farther &s;till, even doubt of his very exi&s;tence, and are confident that all their wick|edne&s;s ari&s;eth from another quarter.</P>
<P>My mind, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, was long agitated between the&s;e widely different opinions: now I verged towards the one, now towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> extreme; and for a long time continued in &s;uch p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inful &s;u&s;pence, that I would have given
<PB N="iv" REF="027249_0003_0FD3CE346E007958">a world to have been &s;atisfied in a matter of &s;uch va&s;t im|portance in human life. But at length I obtained a full and mo&s;t convincing di&s;covery of this very intricate affair; and let who will deny it, I am perfectly &s;atisfied that, however ju&s;tly the guilt of men may be charged on their own cor|ruptions, infernal &s;pirits do exi&s;t, and are fully employed in forwarding their wicked de&s;igns and purpo&s;es. Yea, I have learned &s;o much of the art and addre&s;s of diabolical &s;pirits in this matter, that as I &s;hall, I tru&s;t, avail <HI>my&s;elf</HI> much of the very &s;ingular di&s;covery, &s;o, from a principle of benevolence to mankind, I think my&s;elf fully ju&s;tified without further a|pology, in communicating it to the public.</P>
<P>Know then, that not far from my humble cot, there is a widely extended, mo&s;t tremendous and gloomy VALE, fir&s;t formed, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome dreadful earthquake, or &s;ome other remarkable convul&s;ion in nature. The confines of this valley, on the out&s;ide, are every where nearly level with the &s;urface of the ground, but the precipice within is to the la&s;t degree horrible, in&s;omuch that few have had fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">de enough to approach it. The ancient bards very ju&s;tly called it HORRIDA VALLYS, and we from them, the Vale of Hor|rors. This horrid vale has long been &s;uppo&s;ed, by the cre|dulous vulgar, to be the haunt of infernal &s;pirits; and &s;ome people imagine that it is the only place on earth where they freely conver&s;e about the dark de&s;igns of their mal-admini|&s;iration.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity continually prompting me, at la&s;t conquered my native timidity, and I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to find an en|trance into this unfrequented, unknown, and dreadful place.</P>
<P>But many months, I may &s;ay &s;ome years, were &s;pent in this fruitle&s;s &s;earch, and I de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s. At length, however, having entered a very large and unfrequented wood, one &s;ide of which led to the very edge of the preci|pice; as I walked a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urlongs down a gradual de&s;cent, gloomy beyond whatever I had &s;een before, I came to a huge rock, all overgrown with ivy and mo&s;s. It had the appear|ance
<PB N="v" REF="027249_0004_0FD3CE40F7D20230">of an ancient ruin, &s;omewhat in the form of a pyramid; the bottom occupied a con&s;iderable &s;pace, and the &s;piral top was hardly concealed by the highe&s;t branches of the tall and aged oaks which &s;urrounded it. Near the ground, by chance, I di&s;covered an opening almo&s;t ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aked up with baleful hem|loc and night<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hade. At fir&s;t I thought that this could be no other than the cave of &s;ome ancient Druid; but approaching it, and having with much to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l cleared away the noxious weeds, I found, what I had long &s;ought for, an entrance into the dreadful ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity.</P>
<P>Here my re&s;olution almo&s;t failed me, and I was at the point of relinqui&s;hing the long projected enterprize. At length I recollected my&s;elf a little, and re&s;olved to de&s;cend into the place, though, as I thought, not much le&s;s horrible than hell. The pa&s;&s;age, a little within the entrance, led downwards, almo&s;t in a perpendicular direction; but its &s;traitne&s;s, and the natural unevene&s;s of the rocks that form|ed it, rendered my de&s;cent more practicable and &s;afe than I at fir&s;t expected. Down, however, I went, fathoms I know not how many, ere I found my&s;elf at the bottom, and from an ea&s;y opening entered the <HI>gloomy vale.</HI></P>
<P>Looking up, I &s;aw rocks upon rocks projecting over my timo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous head; and I perceived my&s;elf to be within the mo&s;t hideous inclo&s;ure that &s;ure ever mortal eyes beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld. The vale being &s;olitary and gloomy as death it&s;elf, I &s;aid in my heart, &s;urely if damned &s;pirits are permitted to vi&s;it the earth, this mu&s;t be their rendezvous, and two to one I &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of them. I therefore ob&s;erved carefully my retreat; and by &s;everal marks on the rocks which formed it, I hoped that, on any emergency, I might be directed to the entrance of the cave, by which alone I could return to the &s;ociety of mortals.</P>
<P>I &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound that my precautions were far from being un|nece&s;&s;ary; for I &s;aw, by the feeble light which glimmered in the place, a form mo&s;t frightful making directly towards
<PB N="vi" REF="027249_0005_0FD3CDAC66224C70">me. My heart bounced in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">error, and &s;wift as a hare pre&s;t by &s;anguine hounds, I ran to my little &s;anctu|ary. No &s;ooner had I entered it, but the fiend &s;talked up to the very door of it. The hair of my head &s;tood upright, the blood run down my back as cold as Greenland ice, and I looked upon my&s;elf as a dead man; having often heard of mi&s;erable wretches being torn in pieces by the talons of mercile&s;s infernals. But as the hideous form attempted not to penetrate into the cave nor &s;eemed at all con&s;cious of my being there, I recovered my&s;elf a little, and reviewed it with le&s;s apprehen&s;ion of danger. At length, he e&s;pied another of his clan, to whom he called, and with whom he held the following dialogue, which made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that I afterwards recollected the mo&s;t part of it, and here pre&s;ent it to the worthy reader. The name of this de|vil, as I afterwards under&s;tood, was AVARO, and that of the other, FASTOSUS.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVARO.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO HO! Fa&s;to&s;us, whither &s;o fa&s;t this time of the morn|ing? Be not in &s;uch a hurry, but let a kindred Devil ex|change a few words with you. Pray, how do you do, uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FASTOSUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! my nephew Avaro&mdash;I little thought of finding you in the vale at pre&s;ent. But I am glad to &s;ee you. Pray, how do you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir, I am pretty well, only tired with much exerci&s;e. But pray, where were you going in &s;uch a hurry? When I called to you, you &s;eemed to outfly the wind!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, I &s;hould not be willing to di&s;cover my concerns to every enquirer; but I conde&s;cend to make free with you, on account of our near kindred; and know|ing you to be a true &s;on of Belzebub, I can tru&s;t you with any &s;ecret. As for my pre&s;ent hurry, the occa&s;ion of it is this: The right honorable <HI>Madame de la Cocquette</HI> having an inclination to a &s;uit, of &s;ome fa&s;hion never before invent|ed, was thrown into a violent fever, through the dullne&s;s of the mantua makers, who could devi&s;e no <HI>cut</HI> &s;uitable to the
<PB N="8" REF="027249_0007_0FD3EC018169C548">lady &s;hip's de&s;ire. Finding her life to be in danger unle&s;s &s;he was gratified, I was la&s;t night di&s;patched to Hell to procure a new pattern from the be&s;t arti&s;ts there; and having got it, I was going po&s;t to France, to a&s;&s;i&s;t my lady's mantua-ma|ker in cutting and fini&s;hing it: which done, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall have a trip to London, to accommodate the counte&s;s of <HI>Prude|land</HI> with a &s;uit again&s;t the next court-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! the courtly Fa&s;to&s;us become mantua-ma|ker! I &s;hould never have thought of &s;uch an employment, for my part. You have <HI>now</HI> de&s;cended low indeed, uncle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, your ignorance almo&s;t provokes me to be angry with you. But you need not be &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at my concerns with the mantua-makers; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;|&s;ure you, that I am &s;o much admired for my &s;kill in dre&s;s, by both &s;exes of the human race, that there is &s;carcely a &s;uit of cloaths made either for man or woman, without my direc|tion. Nor &s;hall you find a peruke-maker hardy enough to venture a wig on the block, ere he has had my opinion of it. In &s;hort cou&s;in, there is very little done, and in dre&s;s, there is nothing done, in high life or low, but I have a hand in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have offended, my honoured uncle, I humbly beg your pardon; I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;aid nothing out of di&s;re&s;pect to you: we all know that your &s;pirit is princely, your mo|narchy great, and your dominion very exten&s;ive. But in|deed I never thought of your being conver&s;ant with taylors, barbers and mantua makers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nephew, I am not angry. Neverthele&s;s, you ought to revere me as your elder and better, and not take upon you to call in que&s;tion the truth of what I &s;ay. As for the barbers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are a &s;et of transformi&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed wholly by my dexterity; and but for my &s;overeignty over man, the&s;e transformations had never been introduced. Now the transforming trade goes on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that there is rea|&s;on to hope very many will be at la&s;t transformed into the likene&s;s and nature of our &s;able fraternity.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, uncle, be not angry with me, if I don't &s;peak altogether as you would have me, for you know I never had any inclination to learning or politene&s;s; and I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my wonder at &s;ome things you &s;ay. Be&s;ides, I am amazed to &s;ee you look &s;o thin; why you look like a &s;keleton! What have you been doing, or where have you been? By your looks, you might have travelled bare-footed to the Holy-land, or crept on your hands and feet to Medina, and wept forty days by the tomb of our dear friend Maho|met. You have not been on pilgrimage, &s;ure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, from what I had &s;aid, you might have known that I have not been on pilgrimage very lately; tho' I a&s;&s;ure you, I have often travelled to Jeru&s;alem and to Mec|ca as a guide to tho&s;e holy pilgrims. There is not one of all the bare-legged travellers who will &s;tir their foot from home, till their good friend Fa&s;to&s;us is equipped in palmerian ha|biliments, to pre&s;s forward in the van as their protector. Nor are the&s;e pilgrims my only va&s;&s;als, for the &s;uper&s;titious of all denominations have with one con&s;ent devoted them|&s;elves to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but uncle, I am &s;ure they wor&s;hip me with &s;incere regard, as well as they do you; and I either attend them in per&s;on, or pour my influences upon every one of them, in all their religious journies to Jeru&s;alem, Mecca, or el&s;ewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be &s;o, Avaro; but their pro&s;titution to co|vetou&s;ne&s;s hinders not their devotion to pride: for I have conducted many of this fraternity to the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;epulchre of Je&s;us of Nazareth, who in their own opinion were made &s;o holy thereby, that when they returned to their native country, they thought the earth it&s;elf unworthy to bear the pre&s;&s;ure of a foot, which had trod the thre&s;hold of the ador|ed &s;epulchre. The&s;e religious adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">res (e&s;pecially if they obtain &s;ome precious relicks, of which there are great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tore in Pale&s;tine) generally li&s;t them &s;o far above their fellow-creatures, that thenceforward they can hold no intercour&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="027249_0009_0FD3CD8A5FB2AB78">with the common people, le&s;t their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;potle&s;s gar|ments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be polluted with worldly filthine&s;s. Nor is it uncommon for the&s;e fanta&s;tical devotees to imagine, that by their journies to Judea they have gained con&s;iderably above the price of heaven. So that when they come to die, they have holine&s;s &s;ufficient for them&s;elves, and a hand&s;ome lega|cy to bequeath, as an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-out to &s;ome poor brother who loves home better than the Holy-land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Fa&s;to&s;us, but then you may thank my brother Falax and me for your Jeru&s;alem journies: none of them would have been in&s;tituted but through fal&s;hood, deceit, and covetou&s;ne&s;s. And I really think that we did excellent &s;er|vice to the great Belzebub and the &s;ublime port of Hell, in impe&s;ing that cheat upon mankind. Though by the way, one would wonder that the rea&s;onable mind &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;y deceived, &s;eeing there is nothing in any of the&s;e pilgrimages that has &s;o much as the appearance of religion.</P>
<P>Often have I laughed in my &s;leeve, to &s;ee the fooli&s;h pil|grims, with holy awe and profound reverence, approach a log of rotten wood, fully believing it to be part of the cro&s;s on which Immanuel was crucified. Oh! how have I &s;een them congratulate them&s;elves on their &s;uppo&s;ed happine&s;s, if by any means they had procured a diminutive chip of an old go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t; from the hand of a venerable prie&s;t, with his holy word upon it, that it was part of the cro&s;s! And to &s;peak the truth, which you know I am not very fond of, the&s;e re|verend gentlemen have words and wood equally plenty; for when one log is &s;old off, they immediately replace it with a|nother; &s;o that this market will not &s;top for want of mer|chandi&s;e whil&s;t there is a tree left in the fore&s;t of Lebanon. I would not on any account, that the world &s;hould know that traffic in relicks is all a cheat, by the help whereof my dear children the Jeru&s;alem prie&s;ts get more money for chips of rotten wood, than the greate&s;t merchant in Norway gets for his ma&s;ts, and yards, &amp;c.</P>

<P>By what you &s;ay, and I own it to be right, cou|&s;in, you and I mu&s;t &s;hare the per&s;ons and divide the &s;poil be|twixt us on the day of reckoning. You and cou&s;in Falax have laid the &s;nare very craftily, and I by my haughty influ|ences, drive the fools to it. Good Avaro, your game would not go well without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and while you and I continue to play into each others hand, we can readily bring the two fools to meet each deceiving and being deceived. I mean, we can bring the covetous fool and the credulous fool together. The credulous deceives the covetous fool with his money, and the covetous deceives the credulous with his rotten wood. Dear Avaro, our work goes forward apace, and we &s;hall have them both at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it, Fa&s;to&s;us; for both the covetous and over credulous are ours by common con&s;ent. Our game could not well go better than it doth at pre&s;ent, for all ranks and degrees of people are &s;ubjected to our potent &s;way. No doubt but you have heard of that noble piece of architecture called the Triple-Crown, which I and my brother Falax made for our very worthy friend and &s;tedfa&s;t ally the POPE of ROME.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of it? &s;urely I have; was not I the prin|cipal per&s;on concerned in the work? But Avaro, you have an ugly way of denying people the due honours of their la|bour. But for me, His holine&s;s would never have thought of &s;uch an invention. And as I had the principal hand in it, I ever, that the be&s;t mathematician in hell could not have in|vented a more excellent piece. I have thought, ever &s;ince, that the artful Falax acted his part with as much dexterity in the formation of that capital ornament, as when he and we a&s;|&s;i&s;ted our venerable friend, Mahomet in compo&s;ing the Al|coran, But the chief beauty of it was, to &s;ee our hoaty friend the Pope, with greater confidence than if he had been oue of our&s;elves, exalt his papal chair above all that is cal|led God. So that now, in the &s;en&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">omi&s;h impo&s;t|or, &s;aving and damning depend no longer on the ju&s;tice and
<PB N="12" REF="027249_0011_0FD3CD87AAFEED70">mercy of the Eternal, but upon the will and plea&s;ure of him who fills the infallible chair.</P>
<P>Were we any thing but Devils, who&s;e hatred to Truth is implacable, it would have grieved us to &s;ee how &s;he &s;ighed and &s;obbed, as if her heart would break, when the Impo&s;t|or a&s;&s;umed the character of infallibility. She knocked with violence at the gates of the bi&s;hop's palace; but there was no admi&s;&s;ion for her there.&mdash;She begged and prayed that the inferior ranks of the reverend clergy would receive her; but not one of them would &s;uffer her to come under their roof; &s;o that the poor heaven born lady &s;wooned in the &s;treets, and there was none to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Her eyes became as fountains of briny tears, trickling down her radiant cheeks; her locks were di&s;hevelled, and her apparel hung dangling around her. In this mournful plight &s;he went through all the &s;treets of the my&s;tic Babylon, uttering her lamentation in every public place, and in every concour&s;e of the people. But as in former times &s;he had piped to mens, and none of the wor&s;hippers of the Bea&s;t would dance; &s;o now &s;he mourned to them, but none of them would lament. She &s;tretched forth her hands all the day long, but none of them would attend to to her; the venerable pope, father of the world, having publi&s;hed a decree, that none of them &s;hould &s;uffer her under their roof, nor admini&s;ter the lea&s;t comfort to her in her calamity, under pain of the Rack, the Gibbet, the Wheel, or Fire and Faggot. Yea more,&mdash; when his Holine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the importunity of Divine truth, and perceived that the would be a perpetual thorn in his &s;ide, if not timely and wi&s;ely prevented by forcing her out of the world, clad him&s;elf in Vulcanian armour, &s;ought for her in every corner of Babylon; when he met with her, launch|ed his fatal &s;pear with papal force again&s;t her, that wound|ing her &s;o deeply, &s;he fainted and &s;ell to the ground, and no doubt had died if &s;he had not been immortal. When the mo&s;t holy bi&s;hop had thus depre&s;t her, he cried out in devi|li&s;h triumph, "<HI>I am the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Peter. The Vicar of

<P>It was a noble enterprize; nothing could exceed it. I am per&s;uaded, that the man who was in-dwelt by our brother Legion, and re&s;ided among the tombs, was never capable of coming &s;o near to us Devils in cruelty, deceit, and fal&s;ehood, as that &s;ame venerable man, his infallible ho|line&s;s, hath upon every occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>Well, &s;aid!, mo&s;t reverend father, let not your pious mind be afflicted about the young gentleman's &s;oul. Let you and your worthy brethren ob&s;erve my in&s;tructions, and I &s;hall undertake to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of his e&s;tate; which, as you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, will great|ly redound to the fa&s;ety of his &s;oul.</P>

Then be &s;ure to &s;ay ma&s;s for him to your la|dy, St. Dominic, St. Francis, or to the &s;aint of your con|vent, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. That being done let a &s;kilful me&s;&s;enger from your reverences wait on the &s;on and heir, to tell him that, alas! his poor father is got much dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er into purgatory than was expected, on account of &s;ome &s;ins he had concealed from his confe&s;&s;or: which &s;ins, becau&s;e they are hidden, will take a great deal of burning unle&s;s expiated in time, by frequent ma&s;&s;es&punc; Tell him that you are not certain, but you hope, about two hundred crowns, laid out in ma&s;&s;es to &s;ome favourite, loquacious faint, may go near to procure his deliverance.

<P>Having received the money, you mu&s;t take care not to go any more to the young gentleman, till the time that all the ma&s;&s;es might have been &s;aid; then go to him again, and tell him that by &s;ervent application, you have at la&s;t got his father's &s;oul within a few yards of the &s;urface of the flames, that you cannot po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore him an inch farther till more ma&s;&s;es are &s;aid for him; and that you think an hundred crown's worth more may, in all probability clear him: this being received, take care not to vi&s;it him too &s;oon, but wait till another quantity of ma&s;&s;e might have been &s;aid. At a proper time, go to him again, expatiate much upon the piety of your brethren tell him, that by their endeavours, his father was quite di&s;charged from the court of Purgatory, and was ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> going to be turned out at the heaven-end of the town, when it happened, mo&s;t un|luckily, that there came up the &s;oul of a woman, whom he had debauched in his life-time; that this malicious woman

But, as his unlucky &s;tars would have it, ju&s;t as the porter opened the gate, there came up the &s;oul of a mendicant friar whom the old gentleman had in his life time unhappi|ly beat, and now openly accu&s;ed him of this almo&s;t unpar|donable crime: on which account he was remanded back to more exqui&s;ite torments than ever.

<P>You know very well, reverend father, in what tender and pious &s;train to tell your &s;tory; and to make it penetrate the deeper, you can &s;hed a few crocodile tears over it: if you manage wi&s;ely, you may in this ca&s;e, &s;ell your tears at more than a crown each. Be &s;ure thus always to find out &s;ome impediment or other to the old man's relea&s;e; you may bring him often to the gates, but if once you let him go through, all your hopes are over from this quarter.

<P>So then I find that you are a papi&s;t as well as me. I my&s;elf have large concerns among the clergy, and with none more than his holine&s;s the pope, the great par&s;on at Rome, the par&s;on of the par&s;ons. This univer&s;al par&s;on, though he pretends to be de&s;cended from Peter my enemy, hath conceived &s;uch a good opinion of my abilities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> will not make a decree, nor publi&s;h a bull, till I have put the fini&s;hing hand to it. You know, cou&s;in, that I am none of tho&s;e who are backward in &s;hewing their opinion, but rea|dily dictate to all who refer them&s;elves to my direction. As to his holine&s;s, notwith&s;tanding he is the father of the whole church, he is my humble &s;ervant; and, as I &s;aid before, con&s;ults me upon all occa&s;ions. The advice that I give, in general, is, that by all means he take care to keep up his au|thority over the con&s;ciences and liberties of mankind: and the &s;ame advice I give to the clergy in general; hence eve|ry par&s;on attempts to reign within his own di&s;trict, de&s;potic and &s;upreme over the con&s;ciences of the people, who are o|bliged under pain of damnation to honour him as the pleni|potentiary of heaven, and the arbitrary di&s;tributer of ble&s;|&s;ings and cur&s;es. I advi&s;e his holine&s;s at all events, to &s;up|port his infallibility beyond the &s;criptures of truth, and his &s;upremacy above the laws of God or man. This &s;ame ad|vice I whi&s;per in the ear of my clergy in general, who, to a man, agree that the &s;criptures &s;hall not pa&s;s with toleration, unle&s;s it is dre&s;t in the garb of their interpretations; as &s;uch, and only as &s;uch, it is impo&s;ed on their pari&s;honers.

<P>Aye, &s;ir, that is the heaven of the prie&s;ts: they both &s;eek and have their reward. The fat of the land is in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and they are honored as the directors of con&s;cience.

The loyalty of the arch-bi&s;hops is in&s;ured by the hope of a cardinal's hat, and their right reverences the bi&s;hops, are &s;ure to remain inof|fen&s;ive animals, in hope of attaining, in &s;ome future period, the archi-epi&s;copal dignity.

<P>Employed, do you &s;ay? never fear me. I have not been idle, I a&s;&s;ure you. Do you &s;uppo&s;e that I can pick up no game in Britain in this golden-age? If you do, you are greatly mi&s;taken. It is true that &s;ome of the late kings of England have been my avowed enemies, and as far as in them lay have expelled me the kingdom. But be they as vigilant as they will, I find opportunity of breaking through the fences which they have reared again&s;t me: when you may be &s;ure if I cannot get great, I pick up &s;mall game; of which I can only give you a very &s;mall &s;pecimen at pre&s;ent. In one place I per&s;uaded an ambitious child to poi&s;on, or otherwi&s;e kill, an old cumber&s;ome parent, who will not die without violent mea&s;ures. I prevail with a rogue to di&s;patch his woman, and her brat, to pre&s;erve his own reputation and e&s;tate. In a third, I &s;tir up an ambiti|ous
<PB N="30" REF="027249_0029_0FD3CF41B63DB248">&s;ervant to kill and plunder his ma&s;ter; and frequently I can prevail with one gentleman to kill another in a duel, on &s;ome punctilio of fal&s;e honor. And &s;ometimes, I per&s;uade the de&s;pairing wretch to lay hands on him&s;elf, de&s;troy his own mi&s;erable life, and by doing &s;o enter upon another in|finitely more mi&s;erable. Then I take to my heels, and am followed with a hue and cry all over the nation. But thank you, I am two &s;wift for them all: I never give them time to &s;ay, "Cradelis is here." But they often &s;ay, "the&s;e are the tricks of that horrid devil, Crudelis."</P>

<P>In reality, Avaro, (to make u&s;e of a human phra&s;e) your ignorance is enough to provoke the very devil. Do not you know yet, that if I were not Jack of all trades and religions, I could never maintain my &s;way over men as I do. I have very great concern in religions matters, I a&s;|&s;ure you, and that among more denominations than &s;ome people like to hear of. Sometimes I am among the Pagans wor&s;hipped a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an arch-flamin, and pre&s;ident of all their religious orders. Very frequently I have the honor of filling the papal chair, then I am adored under the venera|ble names of Pious, Innocent, Benedict, &amp;c. accounted the univer&s;al pa&s;tor, head of the church, and father of the whole world. Occa&s;ionally, I &s;it as judge in the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in|qui&s;itive tribunal, where Concupi&s;centia and I are adored as divinities. Now I am an holy mu&s;&s;ulman, and &s;tiled, his reverence mufti Muly Alab. Then, before you are a|ware, I am &s;hut up in a cloi&s;ter with the nuns and friars, whom I make more proud of their pretended cha&s;tity than a thou&s;and &s;aints of their real graces; on &s;uch occa&s;ions, I am known by the name of the venerable matron Humility.
<PB N="32" REF="027249_0031_0FD3CF44AF82EEF0">It happens al&s;o, that I am obliged to metamorpho&s;e my&s;elf into a capuchine, or a Palmerian friar, and in that &s;hew of &s;elf denial I beg my bread from door to door; by the&s;e means I teach the fanta&s;tical devotees to be more proud of their awkard form, and voluntary humility, than a wi&s;e carl would be of all his landgraviate. Anon, I change my &s;tation, and find my&s;elf an abbot of a convent, where my depending prie&s;ts and brethren wor&s;hip me under the name of the holy father. Then, very &s;oon after you'll find me attending the worthy confe&s;&s;or in his vi&s;itation, when to be &s;ure I per&s;uade his &s;elf-conceited reverence that he is well nigh as pure as the mo&s;t holy mother pope Joan, a fortunate lady, who a few centuries ago became head of the church, and mother of the whole world. The hermit, in his cell, on the mountains of Ararat, frequently offers his adorations to me, and for my part, in return for his ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, I am in no wi&s;e &s;paring of my exalting influence.

<P>Ay, Avaro, the hermit believes &s;o, but for my part I believe no &s;uch thing. I know better, though I thus delude him. But to pa&s;s on with my &s;tory, I can tell you, I have a good deal of employment among your di&s;|ciples, cou&s;in, and with them I work wonders of compell|ed genero&s;ity. I meet with many who never had the heart to perform one virtuous, benevolent action whil&s;t health continued; who, when they perceive that they mu&s;t come to a reckoning in the other world, are very a&s;&s;iduous to have their accounts balanced aforehand. I per&s;uade them to leave a ma&s;&s;y &s;um to this ho&s;pital, to the other pari&s;h, or to certain meeting-hou&s;es. When I thus direct the will of devotees, one leaves gold enough to build a chapel for our lady, a &s;econd doth the like for St. Peter, and a third for St. Dominic. But in general they are mo&s;t fond of &s;aints of their own rearing, the greate&s;t part of whom are now made con&s;tellations in the nether &s;ky, and courtiers to the prince Belzebub. A&s;k you me, Avaro, what end the te&s;|tator has in tho&s;e pious legacies? I tell you, by this time he &s;ees the manner in which he got and kept his money, has not the lea&s;t endency to &s;ave him from de&s;truction; and he knows but one way to avert the impending judgment, that is to leave his &s;o and &s;o gotten money for the good of the church, and that, he is told, never fails to &s;anctify e|very mea&s;ure taken to procure it. Some of tho&s;e deluded te&s;tators are not without hope that, in &s;ome future period,
<PB N="34" REF="027249_0033_0FD3CF47B1569998">their names will be enrolled in the pope's bible; and their &s;hrines adored in the Chri&s;tian pantheon, at Rome, where all the gods of the papal hierarchy are en&s;hriued.</P>

<P>Good Fa&s;to&s;us. I really think that if the papi&s;ts would act in character, they would dedicate their temples to St. Judas, St. Demas, St. Demetrins, St. Alexander the copper-&s;mith, &amp;c. for they are the genuine offspring of tho&s;e celebrated heroes.</P>

It was the mo&s;t excellent device imaginable to introduce pagani&s;m under the &s;pecious &s;hew of orthodox and infallible Chri&s;tianity. And I can tell you, there is no e&s;&s;ential difference between the popi&s;h religion and that of &s;ome &s;ects of very &s;taunch prote&s;tants: but tho&s;e things we mu&s;t keep to our&s;elves, for I would not for ever &s;o much our people &s;hould know that the popi&s;h religion is diabolical.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III. INFIDELIS and IMPIATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE way being clear by the departure of Fa&s;to&s;us and Avaro, I came out of my lurking place, in order to make what di&s;coveries I could in the valley, which I now knew to be a rendezvous for tho&s;e evil &s;pirits, who &s;o dread|fully have en&s;laved mankind. I had not gone far, before my alarmed imagination transformed every thing I &s;aw into a devil; the croaking of the raven was as dreadful as the voice of an hobgoblin; and the &s;hrieking of the owl as ter|rible as the roaring of Appollyon. Every di&s;tant bu&s;h &s;eem|ed to bear the a&s;pect of &s;ome devouring fiend; &s;o powerful was the influence of my imagination. Curio&s;ity, however, had &s;till the a&s;cendancy over my fears; and I wandered from place to place, &s;eeking for &s;omething new. At length, I &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance, a tall gigantic form, &s;lowly moving towards me: a form nearly as huge as the &s;teeple of St. Cuthbert's church, at Dulmen&s;is. Every time he contract|ed his exten&s;ive che&s;t, he darkened the air with the breath which i&s;&s;ued from his expanded no&s;trils, as pillars of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oak from the chimney of a fire engine; &s;maller &s;treams of the &s;ame darkening vapour came curling forth from his arm|pits, and every other pore of his &s;kin, &s;o that wherever he came he blackened the air around him.</P>
<P>Now thought I, my life is not worth two-pence, if yon|der demon lay hold on me: therefore I ran with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;peed to the clift of the rock, where I had lurked &s;o &s;ecure before; and having taken &s;anctuary in the &s;ubterraneout cell, I ga|thered &s;o much courage as to peep out, that I might learn what was become of the terrible mon&s;ter, I &s;aw that he was got almo&s;t at the door of my cave. Frightened I was you may be &s;ure, neverthele&s;s I comforted my&s;elf with the thoughts, that &s;uch a tremenduous bulk could not enter my nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w retreat. He &s;aid to him&s;elf (his voice as he &s;poke
<PB N="36" REF="027249_0035_0FD3CE29368922C8">re&s;embling hollow thunder) "I thought I had &s;een the ho|norable Fa&s;to&s;us and the careful Avaro walking here ju&s;t now; but I might be mi&s;taken; or if they have been here, they are gone on our great father's bu&s;ine&s;s, no doubt. Well, &s;eeing it is &s;o, I will take a turn or two in the Vale, and then return to my bu&s;ine&s;s again."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the terror of my mind, I was eager to know what he was, and how he came hither; but dur&s;t not di&s;cover my&s;elf le&s;t he &s;hould prove a devil of the canibal kind, which if he &s;hould, I thought that he would &s;carce make one mouthful of my diminutive carca&s;e. But when he mentioned going to bu&s;ine&s;s again, I queried whe|ther he might not be one of Vulcan's &s;miths, come out of the forge to take a refre&s;hing walk; then I recollected, and a&s;ked my&s;elf, "If he is one of the cyclops, how came he to be acquainted with the devils Fa&s;to&s;us and Avaro!" I continued in this dreadful &s;u&s;pence for &s;ome time, till at la&s;t &s;eeing one of his companions, he entered into di&s;cour&s;e with him. I found that his name was INFIDELIS, and that of the other, IMPIATOR.</P>

<P>What plea&s;ure does it give me, my dear Impiator, to hear that you are &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in en&s;uaring the minds, and corrupting the morals of mankind, throughout every nation of the world. If what I hear of you be true, you approve your&s;elf a right chip of the old block. I rejoice

<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed &s;ir, it mu&s;t not be denied that my king|dom is in a growing condition, all over the world. I think I was hardly ever &s;o much, and never more care&s;&s;ed than I am now. Even in pagan nations heretofore remarkable for uprightne&s;s and temperance, I have introduced the fa&s;hionable vices of the Chri&s;tian world: &s;o that an Indian will drink and &s;wear even with an Engli&s;hman; and lie and cheat as fa&s;t as a Gaul or an Hollander. Greatly am I beholden to a certain company for in&s;tructing the ea&s;t|ern world in the learned arts of violence, rapine and mur|der: not to dwell however on the conver&s;ion of the pagans to the vices of nominal Chri&s;tians; much improvement has been made even in Chri&s;tendom it&s;elf, of which take the following in&s;tances out of many that might be given.</P>
<P>It is not a va&s;t number of years &s;ince your &s;on Impiator was held in perfect di&s;dain in Scotland; but now I have, cho&s;en many legions of the Caledonians for my&s;elf: I think I ought rather to &s;ay, that being quite tired of the &s;er|vice of &s;obriety, a prince of another family, they made choice of me for their ruler. But you know, father, that I am no &s;cholar, therefore improprieties in my &s;peech are not at all to be wondered at. However, I have reduced the Scotch to &s;uch a veneration for my once hated per&s;on, that they have cordially embraced the ornamental vices of the Engli&s;h nation; &s;uch as Sabbath-breaking, whoring, drunkenne&s;s, &s;wearing, gambling, &amp;c. but whether they will be as &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cee&s;sful in obtaining pen&s;ions from the govern|ment after they have gambled away their e&s;tates, is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, fir, I obtained help from a quarter whence there was not the greate&s;t rea&s;on to expect it. I mean from the par&s;ons, the &s;piritual guides of the people. It happen|ed thus: the par&s;ons of the kirk quarrelled among them&s;elves, and divided into two parties. One of which for&s;ook their mother kirk, and very &s;olemnly delivered up the other par|ty to the devil; on the other hand the reverend gentlemen who abode in the kirk, in the like &s;pirit of devotion, de|livered up the &s;chi&s;matics, par&s;on and people to Belzebub. Belzebub, who you know is never backward in receiving a gift of this kind, finding that all the Pre&s;byterians in Scotland were thus in full tale made over to him, laid his hands upon as many of them as he could conveniently reach, and made &s;uch u&s;e of them as greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted my operations. Little was now to be heard in the palpit except railing, &s;colding, calling ill names, and to&s;&s;ing anathemas, from one party to the other: thus while they went on bandying cur&s;es, we went on per&s;uading the people that religion is a farce, and that true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in pre&s;ent gratifica|tion; and this doctrine readily affecting the heart and &s;en&s;es, was eagerly received, and my government e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a favourable juncture indeed; and I have often remarked, that if there was any turn of religi|ous affairs much in our favour, for the mo&s;t part, we have par&s;ons to thank for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it, many in&s;tances of this might be given.

<P>I perceive, child, that you are no great profi|cient in theology: as for me I have dealt again&s;t divine mat|ters all my days. It is your province to counteract moral principles, not interfering much with things divine, and my province to oppo&s;e truth rather than promote immorali|ty; therefore I &s;hall inform you how it comes to pa&s;s. Know then, that what a man is when he dies, &s;uch he is in the eye of the moral law to all eternity; for death ca&s;ts the dye, and the &s;ame po&s;ture in which the tree falls it mu&s;t lie for ever; but with unbelief they never more agree. For in&s;tance, many of them whil&s;t on earth could not be prevailed on to believe that there is a God, but in hell they are feelingly convinced of the truth of this doctrines. Now they believe that there is a terrible God, and that they are fallen into his dreadful hands. Search hell through all its corners; ran&s;act every furnace in the fiery world, and you'll find never an athei&s;t therein.

Other's, whil&s;t health and &s;trength continued with them, &s;uppo&s;ed God was only je&s;ting, when he threatened the &s;inner with the vengeance of eternal fire, but now they are in hell, enduring their vengeance, they verily believe that he was in earne&s;t.

<P>For in&s;tance, when God &s;aid to man, "Thou &s;halt not eat of the fruit of &s;uch and &s;uch a tree." Although then in my infancy, I &s;tepped up to man, and thus interrogated him; hath God indeed &s;aid &s;o? Are you &s;ure of it? Are you not mi&s;taken, think you? You mu&s;t needs have mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|der&s;tood him, for it cannot be con&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of &s;uch a being as God is, to forbid your eating the fruit of &s;uch a divine tree. And as God had &s;aid, "In the day you eat thereof you &s;hall &s;urely die." I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to man after this manner. Die too! nay, you &s;hall not die. That is only an empty threatening, to keep your con&s;cien|ces in awe; for God doth very well know that if you eat of that precious fruit ye &s;hall be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s like him&s;elf; having knowledge of good and evil: for this it is that he hath pro|hibited the u&s;e of this divine tree.

By the&s;e means I brought over man to my obedience; thus I e&s;tabli&s;hed my intere&s;t upon earth, and hitherto I have maintained it, With &s;afety may I &s;ay that my good friends, both par&s;ons and people to this day, love me as their lives, and at any time &s;ooner take the bare word of the adored Infidelis, than the word and oath of the God of Heaven.</P>

Fa&s;to&s;us and I, in|deed, have a di&s;pute between us, concerning the extent of our earthly territories; I can freely allow him the pre-emi|nence with re&s;pect to his angelic dominions; but I can ne|ver be brought to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that his &s;way over mankind is more exten&s;ive than mine, nor yet more &s;overeign. I yield to none in this debate, for all men are concluded under my governments and what makes greatly for my intere&s;t is, the far greater part of them, cannot be per&s;uaded that I have any real exi&s;tence. Thus it is, my dear Impiator, I reign almo&s;t univer&s;ally over mankind, and they perceive it not. Many thou&s;ands of tho&s;e good people who believed nothing of my exi&s;tence, and who, in their own imagina|tion had believed well all their days, have I conducted very &s;afely down to the dark abodes of ever-growing angui&s;h.

<P>Then I proceed. My kingdom doth not con&s;i&s;t of all the land known by the name of Impiety-Real, as &s;ome geographers alledge, &s;everal provinces being made over by treaty, to my uncle Fa&s;to&s;us; &s;uch as the provinces of Ci|vility, Legality, Pre&s;umption, and Formality. I reign o|penly, only, over the land called Impiety-Enormons, and in our country the laws are as black as the bottomle&s;s pit, for there, iniquity is e&s;tabli&s;hed by authority. As to the re&s;t of my kingdom, it was like all the branches of Belzebub's government, accompli&s;hed by &s;ubtilty and guile. For man con&s;idered &s;imply as a creature, could never have been &s;ub|jected to my &s;way; for this rea&s;on I was put to my &s;hifts, to find out &s;ome proper method for introducing my regal power.</P>
<P>So violent was the oppo&s;ition to it, that my brain was put to the utmo&s;t torture, and after all I &s;hould have been oblig|ed to return to my native country, with my finger in my mouth, had it not been for the timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance I received from my worthy friends and relations. My good old moth|er, who you know hath an excellent hand at a dead lift, by means peculiar to her&s;elf, kicked up &s;uch a du&s;t, as almo&s;t put out the eyes of one of the mo&s;t vigilant and formidable of my numerous adver&s;aries; a captain, from who&s;e hand I had much to fear, his name was Intellectus; from that time to this, he hath been incapable of di&s;cerning my deformities, and the danger to which men are expo&s;ed by my dominion.
<PB N="46" REF="027249_0045_0FD3CDAA956CB5F0">And what makes very much for me, the old gentleman can hardly be per&s;uaded, but his eye-&s;ight is now as good as ever it was. I need not tell you the advantages that re&s;ulted to me from thus his deception. At the &s;ame time my worthy un|cle Fa&s;to&s;us, came up to the &s;econd, a &s;turdy chief, who&s;e name was Volens, as tradition &s;ays, and he gave his back a mo&s;t dreadful wrench, in&s;omuch that he has never reco|vered his former po&s;ture.

<P>This triumvirate being thus di&s;abled, I found my con|que&s;t extremely ea&s;y, and without any &s;truggle on the part of the re&s;t, I confined them to ince&s;&s;ant labour and drudgery, in the different parts of my extended territories, where they are as content as po&s;&s;ible with their condition, many of them believing they are &s;till in the garden of paradi&s;e.</P>

<P>Perhaps you have heard that my kingdom is di|vided into &s;everal cantons, according to the di&s;po&s;itions of my &s;ubjects, each canton having its proper employments.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is the canton of drunkards, out of which I &s;e|lect all my courtiers, and officers in general. This canton has &s;everal communications with all the other parts of my dominions, and this we call the royal-canton.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is the &s;wearers canton, a &s;et of people the mo&s;t unaccountably fooli&s;h of all my &s;ubjects; but a people very profitable to our government.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is the canton of thieves, to which all pilferers,
<PB N="47" REF="027249_0046_0FD3CDE417201EC8">robbers, game&s;ters, and deceitful dealers belong. A very populous and &s;plendid canton this is.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is the liars canton: the&s;e are a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two tongues; a people who have very much of the fea|tures of great Belzebub, and a very populous and polite can|ton it is al&s;o.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is the canton of Sabbath-breakers, here there is hardly room enough for the inhabitants, they are &s;o ex|ceedingly numerous.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is the adulterers canton: this is a very dark place; &s;eldom vi&s;ited by the rays of the &s;un. The for|nicators cohabit with them.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is the murderers canton: the darke&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable place in all my dominions, yet for all that, it is very well peopled. For here are ranked not only tho&s;e who cut one another's throats, like the Alexanders, Tamer|lanes, Philips, Loui&s;&s;es, &amp;c. but al&s;o oppre&s;&s;ors of every &s;ort, cruel hu&s;bands and wives, di&s;obedient children, who break their parents hearts: fal&s;e friends, back-biters, and calumniators: indeed all who wanton in the unhappine&s;s of their fellow creatures, like corn-factors and carca&s;e butchers: &s;o that you &s;ee here are many inhabitants, and that too of con&s;iderable figure. 'Tis worthy of ob&s;ervation, that all the cantons have ea&s;y pa&s;&s;ages from one another, &s;o that al|though the employment in each is different from that of the re&s;t, they all hold communication with one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">other, as &s;ub|jects of the &s;ame prince, and heirs of the &s;ame inheritance.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;o numerous are the roads that lead from one to the other, that if a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gets into any one of my cantons, it re|quires no le&s;s than omnipotent power and wi&s;dom, equal to omni&s;cience, to extricate him from a labyrinth &s;o dangerous: and it is well for me that it is &s;o, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of my &s;ubjects are frequently terrified, e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e that work in the deep mines, le&s;t they &s;hould dig <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> through the earth, and tumble into hell.

<PB N="48" REF="027249_0047_0FD3CF58986B6760">for the road by which they e&s;cape from one canton, leads them into another equally dangerous. Many ways there are to throw a man down into my mines, but believe me, if ever any one comes up again, it mu&s;t co&s;t the Almighty an errand from heaven to re&s;cue him. I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, that by the help of the&s;e &s;ubtle pa&s;&s;ages and intricate turnings, I keep my &s;ubjects endaved with as little trouble to my&s;elf, as any ma&s;ter devil that ever a&s;cended out of the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mle&s;s pit.

<P>You promi&s;e fair, cou&s;in. I love your &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, and therefore &s;hall begin. Ob&s;erve then, I am of high parentage, as well as of heroic deeds. I was born in hea|ven, cou&s;in. It was there that Satan the great archangel begat me, upon him&s;elf; and as &s;oon as I was begotten, I

<P>Well if you under&s;tand me not, I &s;hall de&s;cend lower, tho' indeed, I hate to &s;peak of my own affairs in a vulgar &s;tile, &s;o as to be under&s;tood by every petty &s;pirit. But as you, Avaro, are of excellent u&s;e to my operations, I &s;hall &s;tand upon no di&s;tance, but avoid all ceremonies with you. Under&s;tand me then, when God almighty had created all the ho&s;ts of heaven, every angel was perfectly plea&s;ed with his &s;tation; the mo&s;t &s;olid and joyous contentment reigned among, and united the etherial inhabitants, who were, in tho&s;e days very numerous. No one &s;o much as wi&s;hed his &s;tation altered. No one thought him&s;elf capable of higher felicity and perferment than he enjoyed. The adventurous Satan him&s;elf, though he has not been ble&s;t with one mo|ments re&s;t ever &s;ince I was born, before that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the &s;ublime and refined plea&s;ures, his exalted capacity was capable of. And well might he be plea&s;ed with his &s;tation, &s;eeing he was a mighty prince among the angels, next in greatne&s;s to the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God, who was appointed lord lieute|nant of the creation. And a mighty prince in heaven he would have continued, had he not afterwards become a can|didate for omnipotence. As for me I was not born then, but I have heard old Satan my father, with flames of malice and indignation darting from his eyes, tell how the mo&s;t per|fect harmony exi&s;ted among the ho&s;ts of paradi&s;e; till it hap|pened that a declaration was made from the lofty throne, that the Son of God was prede&s;tinated at a time appointed, to a&s;|&s;ume a nature inferior to that of angels; and the mo&s;t high commanded that, in that nature all the angels of God &s;hould wor&s;hip the Son, even as they wor&s;hip the Father, and that
<PB N="55" REF="027249_0054_0FD3CE42E85C5A08">all &s;hould &s;ubmit to the government of the man whom God delighted to honour.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant I was begotten in Satan's alarmed brea&s;t.

<P>Pardon me, great &s;ir, you put me in mind of &s;ome of the modern par&s;ons, for that is the very way that they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t their doctrine to be embraced, implicitly, with|out que&s;tioning its currency.

It is quite laughable to hear the modern clergymen tell their hearers, that they have a right to private judgment, and to know the mind of God for them&s;elves; and at the &s;ame time obliging them implicitly to abide by the confe&s;&s;ion of faith already authenticated.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, cou&s;in, you have fairly laughed me out of my re&s;entment, by the droll conduct of your par&s;ons. How|ever, what I &s;aid, Avaro, I will maintain. It &s;hall never be &s;aid that the devil. Fa&s;to&s;us, did at any time eat his words; but I will conde&s;cend to explain my&s;elf. Without me, Bel|zebub would be none other than an angel; but mixing my&s;elf with his angelic faculties, I render him a perfect devil; the &s;ame I do with all the re&s;t of my infernal &s;ubjects. Belze|bub him&s;elf is but a titular prince; 'tis I who in&s;tigate him, that am the great devil of all. To tell you more, it is I who formed hell it&s;elf, as a place of puni&s;hment. Such is the rec|titude, and equity of his nature, that God never would, nor could, inflict any puni&s;hment without my intervention. He was ever guided in all his works by his own perfections, and therefore could never have puni&s;hed &s;inle&s;s beings: all beings would have remained &s;inle&s;s, but for me; &s;o in making &s;in, I made the puni&s;hment of it. For if once &s;in is introduced, puni&s;hment follows of cour&s;e; it being as natural for &s;in to bring forth puni&s;hment, as it is for the &s;un to &s;end forth light and heat.</P>
<P>No being po&s;&s;ibly can be a devil, but that being who is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed and governed by me, every being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and governed, whether angel or man, is a devil. But for di|&s;tinctions &s;ake, we a&s;cribe only the plain name of fiends, to the angels whom I govern, and to men and women under my
<PB N="59" REF="027249_0058_0FD3CF6C6EF98EF8">dominion, we give the names of devils incarnate, becau&s;e they i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">habit bodies of fle&s;h. The difference in the &s;tature of devils is not, that one is le&s;s devili&s;h than another, but their being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more noble endowments, and more ex|ten&s;ive qualities than others. So you &s;ee the devils of quality among us, are more intelligent, more &s;ubtle, and crafty than devils of a vulgar race. The rea&s;on why Belzebub is head over all the infernal tribes al&s;o, is not becau&s;e he is more depraved than his adherents, but be|cau&s;e he was originally created in a more glorious &s;tation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of endowments more exalted, and ble&s;t with more exten&s;ive natural powers. As &s;uch, being once depraved, he is capable of excelling his fellows, as far in diabolical at|chievements, as at fir&s;t he excelled them in their heavenly &s;tation. The &s;ame rule holds good, through the varicus ranks of my &s;ubjects. Were you to a&s;k me, why it is that devils without a body, are capable of exceeding in &s;weet re|bellion, tho&s;e &s;pirits who are embodied? I would an&s;wer without he&s;itation, "Not becau&s;e the one is le&s;s vicious, or one whit le&s;s depraved than the other, but for the following two very good and &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons;</P>
<P N="1">1. Although I reign and rule in the heart of every one of them, yet whil&s;t they are in the body, they are laid un|der particular re&s;trictions by the Almighty; &s;o that they can|not do all the evil which in their hearts I prompt them to do: and therefore they cannot be &s;o much like Belzebub in their actions as they would be. Fear and &s;hame, very often prevent people from gratifying their impious and unclean in|clinations, when a love of virtue, and the fear of God, are ab&s;olutely out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the natural powers of man are very far in&s;e|rior to the powers of infernal &s;pirits. The more exten&s;ive a man's natural capacity, the nearer he may arrive to the &s;tature of Satan, if unre&s;trained by the grace of God. Hence a crafty and learned pope, is by far more like the devil than
<PB N="60" REF="027249_0059_0FD3CE2338389FB8">an ignorant &s;wag-bellied friar. Yea, Avaro, the more en|larged the capacity of either man or devil may be, as it makes him capable of the higher degrees of wickedne&s;s, even &s;o in proportion to the natural abilities of both &s;hall the pu|ni&s;hment inflicted be. No wicked being is &s;o capable of be|ing wicked as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">afty and under&s;tanding per&s;on, who, if he is not truly virtuous and holy, mu&s;t be truly wicked and devili&s;h. Hence one Hume, one Voltaire, is an hun|dred times more capable of being u&s;eful to us, than fifty H&mdash;w&mdash;ds, or even five times the number of popi&s;h prie&s;ts.

They loved without uncha&s;tity, and enjoyed without un|cleanne&s;s; nor were they in the lea&s;t acquainted with the racking torments of jealou&s;y. No anxious thoughts per|plexing
<PB N="63" REF="027249_0062_0FD3CF70F22C5088">fears, nor di&s;tracting cares, di&s;turbed their peace|ful hearts. Envy, anger, &s;hame, and re&s;entment, were &s;trangers to the new created pair, and never &s;et foot in pa|radi&s;e before my arrival there. Their &s;ole delight was to contemplate the beneficence of their God.</P>
<P>Our eagle-eyed angels when they &s;aw the noble deport|ment of man, &s;oon perceived that he was of the &s;ame nature, which the Son of God was prede&s;tinated to a&s;&s;ume, (for as &s;ome think be might, out of love to the human nature, ap|pear occa&s;ionally to the heavenly ho&s;ts in the form of man

The fir&s;t di&s;covery Belzebub made of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ituation in which man was created, filled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> noble mind with &s;uch violent agitations of rage, envy, ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce and pride, that his fury bur&s;t beyond all bounds.

A coun|cil thus convened, after the prince had a little recovered from the fir&s;t flock of tran&s;porting rage, he related to them what he had di&s;covered concerning the inhabitants of Eden. A&s;ked advice of his &s;enators, who, to a devil vowed &s;peedy de&s;truction to man. Some demar there was re&s;pecting the plan of their operations; for the impolitic part of the a&s;&s;embly finding the &s;mallne&s;s of their number, were for having man a&s;&s;aulted by &s;torm; but the more &s;age politi|cians voted for craft, as the likelie&s;t method to &s;educe them, At la&s;t the augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly came to this unanimous re&s;olution, "That the great Belzebub &s;hould, by certain means, by him to be devi&s;ed, in&s;pire them with my nature, nothing

<P>After he had well weighed every circum&s;tance, the arch-apo&s;tate undertook the enterpri&s;e: but did not judge it pro|per to exerci&s;e force again&s;t them, knowing well, that if their re&s;i&s;tance proved equal to their power, all his de&s;truc|tive mea&s;ures mu&s;t unavoidably be broken, and the enter|pri&s;e mi&s;carry. Therefore like a wi&s;e hero and con&s;ummate politician, he re&s;olved to accompli&s;h by craft and &s;ubtility, what was not to be done by open a&s;&s;ault, nor did he think it advi&s;able to addre&s;s them in his own form, lea&s;t he &s;hould frighten them at his fir&s;t appearance, and by that means render their &s;eduction for ever after impracticable. But ju|diciou&s;ly concluded that the mo&s;t promi&s;ing method was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;ume the body of one of their familiar dome&s;tic anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which were dally under their ob&s;ervation. Accordingly after long con&s;ultation with him&s;elf, and &s;trictly examining the brutal tribes, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a beauteous &s;erpeut, perceiving that it was head of the repule world, and be&s;t fitted for con|ver&s;e with man, with whom al&s;o it was more familiar, than all the bea&s;ts be&s;ide. Thus equipped for executing the deep projected &s;cheme, he &s;till acted with caution becoming the mo&s;t con&s;ummate experience. He cared not to attack them both at once, lo&s;t by any means they &s;hould &s;ee thro' his di&s;gui&s;e, and he &s;hould occa&s;ion his own repul&s;e; there|fore he craftily lurked near them, and overheard their di&s;|cour&s;e, that he might better learn which of them was the weaker v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pirit of great penetration, he &s;oon found that, the woman was not only the weake&s;t but the younge&s;t; and what greatly encouraged his hope, was, that the man loved the woman with the mo&s;t tender affection, a circum&s;tance very painful for him to behold. Peace being now a &s;tran|ger to his own bo&s;om, it was grievous for him to &s;ee the &s;e|licity of the human pair.

<P>Then I begin with the canton of &s;wearers, the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and unaccountable &s;et of people upon the face of the earth. This canton is divided into two provinces, both which are full of people: in the fir&s;t province dwell the fal&s;e &s;wearers; and the profane &s;wearers, in the &s;e|cond.</P>
<P>The province of fal&s;e &s;wearers, is divided into three di&s;|tricts, the fir&s;t of which is inhabited, by knights of the po&s;t, a &s;et of gentry who get their living by giving eviden|ces in cau&s;es to which they are perfect &s;trangers. The&s;e knights commonly make their court to the c&mdash;k of arr-ings, whom they know is be&s;t capable of finding them employ|ment. It is not a great many years &s;ince, a gentleman walking in the &s;e&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, in the Old Baily, was acco&s;t|ed by one of the&s;e knights with, "Pray, &s;ir, do you want a witne&s;s? Sir, I'll &s;erve you as cheap and as well as any man." Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, formerly was a mighty protector of this order of knights: and at this day
<PB N="67" REF="027249_0066_0FD3CF771B414F68">our good friend, the father of the world, his worthy inqui|&s;itors, and not a few right reverend prelates, are head men in the di&s;trict of fal&s;e &s;wearers. Many a good Chri&s;tian, has been brought to the &s;take, or gallows, by their a&s;&s;iduity, both among papi&s;ts and pagans; and more e&s;pecially the former, who are far from being &s;o hone&s;t, as the latter; and not by half &s;o con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>The &s;econd di&s;trict is inhabited by the mercenary &s;wear|ers. This is a race &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cended from the knights of the po&s;t; and to be &s;ure there is a great likene&s;s betwixt the two. The mercenary &s;wearers will buy a piece of goods for five &s;hillings, and as &s;oon as a buyer pre&s;ents him&s;elf, tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that upon his life and &s;oul, it co&s;t him &s;ix &s;hillings. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he meets with another &s;eller of the &s;ame commodity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> order to obtain a good pennyworth he &s;hews him the goods for which he paid five &s;hillings, and tells the &s;tranger, that, "As he hopes to be &s;aved, he gave no more than four and &s;ix|pence for it." The dealers in hor&s;es, drovers, and butchers, are &s;ingulary dextrous at this kind of &s;wearing. In this di|&s;trict, it is a prevalent opinion, that a man is not fit to live in the world, unle&s;s he can &s;wear to a lie.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion is inhabited by the fooli&s;h &s;wearers, a people the mo&s;t remarkably &s;tupid, of any under the government of hell; &s;ome of them are &s;o accu&s;tomed to it from their infancy, that they do not &s;o much as know when they &s;wear, and are as de&s;titute of de&s;ign in the practice, as the parrot when it &s;colds the chamber maid, or as many good people when they &s;ay their prayers at church. Others &s;eem to have &s;uch a low opinion of their own probity, that they imagine no one will believe what they &s;ay, unle&s;s every &s;en|tence is u&s;hered in with an oath in the van, and confirmed by another in the rear. Gentlemen of family, fortune and fa&s;hion, are &s;tationed in this cla&s;s, and are extremely dextrous here. Nor are the officers of the fleet and army le&s;s learn|ed, or devoid of tho&s;e embelli&s;hments. The greate&s;t part of the Engli&s;h officers indeed, marine and military, e&s;teem a

<P>The Briti&s;h army &s;o far excels in this fine art, that they can fairly cur&s;e the French off the field of battle, without ever &s;triking a blow; &s;o terrified are the French at the oaths of the Engli&s;h. Aye, father, I a&s;&s;ure you, that this hero|ic practice, is now &s;o prevalent among the ba&s;e&s;t of the multitude, that I could pick you out a low lifed boat&s;wain, who will vie with an admiral; and a dwarfi&s;h drummer, who will &s;wear with a lieutenant-general, for any money. Yea, I could pick you out a fellow, who cannot procure whole &s;hoes to his feet, that yet will match any noblen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> or e&s;quire in the land at &s;wearing. And, &s;ir, if honor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;i&s;ts in being adepts here, the vile&s;t pedlar may vie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;t of the gentry, and the very footpad may challenge a peer of the realm. The canton of &s;wearers, is a very po|pulous and very honorable place. Here are dukes, knights of all orders, marqui&s;&s;es, and earls. And a very wor&s;hip|ful canton it is too, for numbers of very re&s;pectable corpo|rations, and many ju&s;tices of the peace re&s;ide in it.</P>
<P>I have often laughed, to &s;ee a delinquent brought before a magi&s;trate, and by him be obliged to pay two &s;hillings for every atte&s;ted oath, when the magi&s;trate him&s;elf, had not manhood enough to maintain conver&s;ation for ten mi|nutes, without being guilty of profane &s;wearing.</P>

All of the&s;e, &s;ir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> very fa&s;hionable people.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion is that of holy thieves. That is, men who&s;e theft is in holy things. By holy thieves, I mean un|holy men, &s;u&s;taining holy offices. Such is he, who enters into orders, merely for the &s;ake of a good living. All who climb over the wall, and come not in by the door, are thieves and robbers. Thieves, becau&s;e they &s;teal the por|tion of the prie&s;ts; for having no right to the &s;acerdotal function, their participation of the altar, is &s;acrilegious theft. Robbers, becau&s;e they make havock of the church, and deprive God's children of the food allowed them by their heavenly Father. Here dwell &s;hoals of popi&s;h prie&s;ts, and very con&s;iderable numbers of prote&s;tant clergy, of various denominations, as well as the total &s;um of pagan and maho|metan mu&s;ties. His holine&s;s the pope of Rome, is indeed
<PB N="73" REF="027249_0072_0FD3CF816CAD64A8">pre&s;ident in this divi&s;ion, for he &s;teals the prerogatives of God, and applies them to his own private u&s;e.</P>
<P>The fourth divi&s;ion in the canton of thieves, are tho&s;e whom we call the &s;porting thieves. Such are card-players, cock fighters, hor&s;e-cour&s;ers, and gamblers of all &s;orts. I know of none of my &s;porting &s;ubjects, but what will win if they can, either by upright, or inequitable means. Therefore with us it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that the true gambler is the certain thief. Here too you may find princes, nobles, &s;piritual and temporal, and judges of every rank. Ha! ha! ha! how have I been ready to &s;plit my &s;ides with laughing, to &s;ee an archbi&s;hop lay a&s;ide his mitre, and take up a pack of cards; and the &s;acred judge, after having pa&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;entence on a criminal, lay a&s;ide all his &s;olemnity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t on the &s;prightly &s;port&s;man. Then cried I, oh! the bench! oh! the pulpit! O the gambler.</P>
<P>The fifth divi&s;ion in the canton of thieves, is inhabited by what we call fanta&s;tic thieves. A very contemptible canton this is with &s;en&s;ible people. Yet fooli&s;h as they are with their no&s;trums, they make it appear, that there are people more fooli&s;h than them&s;elves, for they pick the pockets of the neighbouring cantons very cleverly. Here dwell your Da&s;&s;ies, Godfries, Stonghtons, Fluggers, Low|thers, James's, Turlingtons, &amp;c. Here the famous Mr. Mountebank is pre&s;ident, and Mr. Ardrew Arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee is his deputy. In this divi&s;ion nothing is heard of but pills, lozen|ges, troches, baliams, elixirs, drops, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">als, and the ready coin; for the fanta&s;tical thieves can-give no credit.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth divi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of plain hone&s;t high way men. Hone&s;t, when compared with many of the others, for when they are about to rob a man, they very hone&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him their de&s;ign, and &s;take but a few high words, and the mouth of the pi&s;tol again&s;t the pur&s;e and all that is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which, notwith&s;tanding the odds be greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the traveller's fide, the highwayman carries lightly off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the watch

<P>Here too are many venerable prie&s;ts, who, by pretended pardons, di&s;pen&s;ations, &amp;c. play the pick-pocket to great advantage. Much could I &s;ay about this cla&s;s of veterans in the thieving trade, were I not afraid of exciting their re|&s;entment, which would be very detrimental to my de&s;igns, as they lead the con&s;ciences of the laity, ju&s;t which way they plea&s;e.</P>

<P>Ay, &s;ir, a thou&s;and times, and I can tell you that, &s;ome of the greate&s;t of names are enrolled in the annals of this canton of thieves. There are the Grecian and Roman heroes, almo&s;t in general, particularly great Alexander, and Julius Cae&s;ar. There is Tamerlane, there is Kouli Khan, there is Philip of Spain, and there is L&mdash;s of France, who has as good an inclination to thieving as any body. Poor gentleman, it is not half a century &s;ince he put forth his hand, to pick the pocket of George king of Britain, but he got his &s;ingers mo&s;t woefully bitten, before he could pull them in again. But what is bred in the bone will never be out of the fle&s;h; therefore as the Engli&s;h did not take care, effectually to &s;ecure them&s;elves when they had it in their power, they mu&s;t expect further experience of French theft.</P>

<P>One would have thought that, the Engli&s;h have had &s;o many in&s;tances of royal the&s;t, from that quarter, that they would have effectually prevented future danger-from thence.

<PB N="75" REF="027249_0074_0FD3EBF1CC6274B8">kingdoms, which now belong to them in the &s;ame manner, as the pur&s;e of gold belongs, to the highwayman, who took it from the gentleman he murdered.</P>

<P>Ay, &s;ir, great thieves are abundantly more hurt|ful to mankind, than thieves of a dwarfi&s;h &s;ize; tho' fa|mous Tyburn, and the places a-kin to it, &s;eldom have the honor of u&s;hering them into the other world.</P>
<P>The third canton is the liars canton, a people with double tongues, and of the nature of an otter, amphibious; the great Belzebub him&s;elf is grand pre&s;ident here, but is repre|&s;ented by two famous deputies, namely the artful Maho|met, and the good old gentleman at Rome. Of the two the latter is mo&s;t in favour at court, becau&s;e, as Belzebub &s;ays, he is &s;o very much of his own image; although it mu&s;t be owned, Mahomet bears a very great re&s;emblance. All the holy fathers, my lords the inqui&s;itors, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tant familiars. All the venerable patriarchs, and prince|ly cardinals, re&s;ide in the metropolis near the exchange, in the principal &s;treet, which is a &s;traight thoroughfare to hell. The bi&s;hops of both ranks, are &s;tationed next to them, and greatly facilitate the journey of pa&s;&s;engers. The very populous &s;uburbs are inhabited by the &s;ons of St. Ignatius; than whom, none are more excellent at the arts of lying and eva&s;ion; and here too are abundance of friars of every order, who though le&s;s crafty than the je&s;uits, are very diligent in the great work of deceit. In this country, po|litene&s;s and learning have arrived at the greate&s;t perfection, here are abundance of courtiers, and &s;tate&s;man, be&s;ides a|thei&s;ls and dei&s;ts, highly e&s;teemed by our people, for their learning and &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> court liars, are like a dead fi&s;h, they always &s;wim with the &s;tream of power.

When it &s;erves their low and ba&s;e purpo&s;es, you will find them pa|triots, but if the good of the nation cla&s;hes with their &s;ini&s;|ter views, you may find them traitors, either to church or &s;tate, or to both. Of this cla&s;s were Bonner and Gardin|er, zealous Prote&s;tants in the days of Edward the &s;ixth, and bloody papi&s;ts in the reign of his &s;i&s;ter of &s;carlet memo|ry. To this cla&s;s al&s;o belonged Sharp, the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, for it was not conviction but gold, that changed his &s;entiments, from pre&s;btery to prelacy. All the argu|ments which my lords, the bi&s;hops of England had advan|ced, made no more impre&s;&s;ion upon him, than an arrow would have made upon a rock of flint; but when his mo|je&s;ty came in a rhetorical manner, to pre&s;s him home with a heavy pur&s;e of gold, a coach and &s;ix, and a bi&s;hopric, he was quite confounded, and had not a word to &s;ay for mother kirk of Scotland. Such court arguments as this, &s;ir, &s;top the mouths of many a patriot; lord C&mdash;m is a recent proof of this. Such was the force of his elocution, that it could gain battles, &s;ubdue &s;tates, rever&s;e laws, and make placemen tremble, till he was unhappily confounded by a place, a pen&s;ion, and a peerage; and now, poor gen|tleman, he has nothing left to gratify his ambition, but the melancholy reflection of what he once was.</P>
<P>There is another herd of court liars, (excu&s;e the phra&s;e, &s;ir, becau&s;e it is the common opinion, that of all vermin, court liars are the mo&s;t dete&s;table) who fawn like a &s;paniel upon every prince, that a&s;cends the throne, in order to ingratiate them&s;elves into his favour, thereby to make &s;ure of their own emolument. If the manners of the prince are ever &s;o di&s;&s;olute, they care&s;s him as their mo&s;t wi&s;e and a|miable monarch. Tho' he were as much of a da&s;tard as Sardanapalus, they will per&s;uade him that, he may vie with Hector for magnanimity. If he is a drunkard, or glut|ton, they will flatter him with his temperances or repre|&s;ent
<PB N="77" REF="027249_0076_0FD3EBF50AA3E850">his luxury as a princely virtue, very becoming a royal per&s;onage; even if one half of his &s;ubjects be fami&s;hing for want of bread. Some of tho&s;e court liars will tell their prince, that it is no crime at all for him, to enter his neigh|bour's territories, and murder twenty or thirty thou&s;and of his &s;ubjects, tho' there is really no cau&s;e given on their part, for the ho&s;tile inva&s;ion. Some &s;uch villains precipitated Louis of France into a war with Britain, which would infalliably have proved his ruin, had he not been well be|friended by &s;ome people near St. James's.</P>
<P>A truly patriotic courtier is a &s;trong pillar to the throne, but court liars, are the de&s;truction of that prince who&s;e ear they govern.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, that a prince has need either to be a very wi&s;e man him&s;elf, or to have very hone&s;t men about him. Happy is that nation who has a wi&s;e and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dent king, and at the &s;ame time hone&s;t and faithful mini&s;ters. Earthly thrones are &s;o infe&s;ted with fawning flatterers, that if the prince is not very well acquainted with his bible, it is difficult for him to know, whether he is virtuous or vi|cious.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and by tho&s;e means princes are more readily deceived. For a mitred courtier may, perhaps, tell his prince, that it is lawful for a royal per&s;onage, to deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the wife or daughter of one of an inferior rank, but unlawful for a plebian; notwith&s;tanding his &s;piritual lord&s;hip knows very well, that when God &s;aid, "Whoremongers and adulterers I will judge," he exempted not the prince any more than the pea&s;ant, for with him there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, on account of their worldly dignity.</P>
<P>Another right reverend courtier tells his prince, that it is allowable enough in him, on the Sabbath, after the irk&s;ome
<PB N="78" REF="027249_0077_0FD3EBF70B9B4488">&s;ervice is over at church, to divert him&s;elf with a quiet, civil game at che&s;s, quadrille, or whatever his pious inclination leads him to; and that it may be lawful for &s;ome favourite nobility to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;port; but, &s;ays he, it is utterly un|lawful for the hu&s;bandman and low mechanic; though the downy doctor knows well enough, that when the Almighty &s;anctified the Sabbath, it was not a part only, but the whole Sabbath he intended.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Impiator, whatever licence the right rever|ends allow at court, their &s;able brethren in the country are not le&s;s indulgent; for in mo&s;t pari&s;hes in England the people may &s;wear or pray, get drunk or communicate, go to church or or &s;tay at home, get to heaven or hell, ju&s;t as their inclina|tion leads them, for any concern his reverence the par&s;on gives him&s;elf, provided always he is not cheated of his dues.</P>

<P>I know, I am well befriended by many clergymen; but to return to the prince, I a&s;&s;ure you I have often thought that, of all men, it is the greate&s;t difficulty for him to be a good man, and get &s;afe to heaven. He has &s;o many about him, who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ba&s;e enough to commend even his vices, and but very few who love him well enough to correct his errors. But if I become a morali&s;t now, you'll &s;uppo&s;e I act out of character. However, many have exhau&s;ted all their wit and good nature upon the court liars, they are &s;till the &s;ame, they lie as fa&s;t as ever for the &s;ake of money, e&s;tates, high places, &amp;c. therefore &s;ome people call them mercenary liars.</P>
<P>But many of the inhabitants of this canton are le&s;s ambiti|ous, and will very freely tell lies for a penny gain; among&s;t tho&s;e are the travelling trade&s;men, who carry their &s;hops upon their backs. Them we call the petty dealers, and the hum|ble l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs. But we have others more generous &s;till, who will give you a lie fre&s;h from the mint, with no other view but to rai&s;e a laugh: the&s;e we call the merry liars, becau&s;e they go laughing to hell.

Now either my good friend the par&s;on lies to my lord bi&s;hop, or his congregation; but the truth is he lies to both.</P>
<P>The fourth canton is, that of Sabbath-breakers, which is a very populous, polite, and opulent canton indeed. The far greater part of the nobility, and other gentlemen of rank and fortune, re&s;ide here: they are too well bred to wor&s;hip God on Sunday, in public or private. They &s;corn to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves indebted to the Almighty for life, and bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, and all things; or to be accountable to him for the u&s;e they make of their time, e&s;tates and talents. They leave it, to the low-lifed mechanics, to go to church or meeting, or when there, to be devout and take notice of what they are about. Let the par&s;on talk about heaven, or hell, or what he will, they are unconcerned, never once &s;uppo&s;ing them|&s;elves endued with immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>There is my good friend, my lord Time-lagg, a noble|man of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction; he is &s;o taken up through the week with contriving how to provide for him&s;elf, and his creatures, that he is in no condition to go to church on Sun|day, but choo&s;es &s;ome convenient part of it for an airing; either in the coach with my lady, or on hor&s;eback with his con&s;in, '&s;quire Idle.

<P>The London trade&s;men come up as near to his lord&s;hip's example as their circum&s;tances will admit of; their &s;pirits are quite exhau&s;ted with the fatigues of weekly bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore in&s;tead of leading their families duly to church, you may meet &s;quadrons of them every Saturday night and Sunday morning, going to regale them&s;elves with a Sun|day's plea&s;ure, which con&s;i&s;ts in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating, carou&s;ing, and riding.</P>
<P>Then there is your Sabbath-day vi&s;itors; very genteel people. The tea-table go&s;&s;ips are much concerned here, and hear you may find hundreds of tables, the conver&s;ation of which is &s;upported at the expence of the reputation of &s;ome ab&s;ent; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that our go&s;&s;ips are &s;o ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of innate ideas, and are &s;uch perfect &s;trangers to the affairs of civil life, that they cannot &s;upport conver&s;ation five minutes at a &s;itting, but by the help of &s;lander. Hence &s;ome people have faid, that &s;lander is the very &s;oul of conver&s;ation. And &s;ure enough if you will pick out all the &s;landerous expre&s;&s;ions from the conver&s;ation of our go&s;&s;ips, you will have but a very &s;canty fragment re|maining.</P>
<P>There are others &s;o given up to indolence, that they keep great part of the Sabbath in bed, on a couch, or in the ea&s;y chair; the&s;e people are &s;o exceedingly oppre&s;t with the weight of their own bodies that they can attend at neither church nor chapel, although active enough the other parts of the week; and yet they are good Chri&s;tians, and hope to
<PB N="71" REF="027249_0080_0FD3EC00642A0A98">go to heaven when they die; and yet they &s;eldom think of any thing, but living for ever, in order to which they eat, drink, and &s;leep away the Sabbath.

The mercer, draper, and grocer, &s;eem &s;ometimes to be there, but frequently it is an impo&s;ition, for although their bodies may indeed be pre&s;ent, their &s;ouls are gone on a journey, to vi&s;it their cu&s;|tomers, or are left at home in the counting-hou&s;e, balancing their books; examining their trade&s;men's bills, that they may know with whom they can deal to the greate&s;t advan|tage.

<P>As for the indu&s;trious farmer, you may well think, he has &s;omething el&s;e to employ his mind, than either &s;ermon or prayers; for it mu&s;t needs require much thought and foreca&s;t to determine right, where to &s;ow his wheat, where his clover, and what land to &s;et apart for hemp; how to

And he, good man, hath found from long experience, that he can contrive better at church than any where el&s;e; and being willing to thrive in the world, he will let &s;lip no opportunity proper for advantage|ous con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But I can tell you, &s;ir, if the people &s;o frequently put the cheat upon their par&s;on, he in his turn retaliates upon them; and many times when the congregation flatter them|&s;elves that, they &s;ee the par&s;on in and hear his voice from the pulpit, they are mi&s;taken, for it is only his body, his &s;oul being attending the levee of this nobleman, or the o|ther bi&s;hop, making his court for a fatter benefice. The&s;e, &s;ir, are &s;ome of the thinking Sabbath-breakers.</P>
<P>Then there are the mad Sabbath-breakers, a &s;et of the ve|ry dregs of humanity, and yet by &s;ome means or other their impious practices are connived at, notwith&s;tanding interdict|ed by all laws divine and human. Such are our pellet throwers in York&s;hire and Durham, our foot-ball to&s;&s;ers, who are &s;ound all over the nation; our leapers, runners, tavern-hunters, and all of every denomination, who exer|ci&s;e them&s;elves in any &s;port on the Sabbath, are &s;tationed a|long with the mad Sabbath-breakers.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all there are our religious Sabbath-breakers, a di&s;trict that is formed of party zealots, and &s;elf-&s;eekers, both preachers and hearers. As for the former, their doc|trine is various, one man preaches the pope, another, preaches the councils, one preaches St. Dominie, another, St. Francis. One preaches epi&s;copacy, like the great Sacheveral, another preaches pre&s;bytery, as the only way of &s;alvation. One preaches up mankind in general, and another preaches his own per&s;onal endowments in particular, but as for preaching Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that is quite foreign to their purpo&s;e, and is therefore left to be performed by o|thers. Thus, &s;ire, you have had a view of the canton of Sabbath-breakers.</P>

<P>You know, Avaro, when we parted in the morn|ing, I was going to a&s;&s;i&s;t my lady Gaity, to dre&s;s for her vi&s;it to my good lord Frolick. I went accordingly, and hard work I a&s;&s;ure you we had of it. As &s;oon as I appear|ed before the toilet, I received orders to render my&s;elf in|vi&s;ible, and not to depart the room, that I might be in rea|dine&s;s to adju&s;t the head-dre&s;s, and bo&s;om ornaments. Yes, madam, &s;aid I, I will give your lady&s;hip due attendance; with that I rendered my&s;elf invi&s;ible to her, but continued vi&s;ible to all other beholders. So to dre&s;&s;ing we went. Fir&s;t we ornamented the feet, which was attended with very con&s;iderable difficulty; it co&s;t us &s;everal tyings and
<PB N="85" REF="027249_0084_0FD3EC0308B026D0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tyings before her lady&s;hip was plea&s;ed with her own foot. At la&s;t having fini&s;hed the feet, and my lady viewed them &s;everal times in every po&s;ition, we proceeded to other parts of the important work. Fir&s;t, we did and then we undid every part of the finery&punc; But our harde&s;t work about the head and bo&s;om was how to put one as much as po&s;&s;ible out of its native form, and to expo&s;e the other, &s;o as to make &s;ure of attracting the eyes of beholders. Mon&s;ieur Fri&s;&s;ieur, who was our a&s;&s;i&s;tant, gave it as his opinion, that to come up to the very zenith of the mode, it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould bear an head as much as po&s;&s;ible, in re&s;emblance to a ram without horns; and Mrs. Prude, my lady's woman, told us plainly, that Mrs. Pander, who&s;e province it is to e&s;tabli&s;h female cu&s;toms, had expre&s;sly declared, every lady worth above one hundred a-year, ought in a full dre&s;s to wear her bo&s;om quite naked. My lady is adorned with excellent hair, but it will not &s;erve her except it bear a look the mo&s;t unnatural po&s;&s;ible. Her &s;kin, fair as alaba&s;ter, we were o|bliged to daub with patches, the colour of Belzebub's coat, as a token of her loyalty to the black prince of the nether regions. But how to place the&s;e patches was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;tion of no ordinary concern, and hardly re&s;olved at la&s;t&punc; Fir&s;t, we tried one large patch on her chin, but my lady &s;oon per|ceived that it had the beauteous dimple, which nature had there impre&s;t, and therefore it was pre&s;ently removed. Then we tried how the cheek would an&s;wer, but alas! it ob&s;cured the lively ro&s;e, which is a native there, and which my lady takes great delight to view in her gla&s;s; on this account we exempted the cheek from the burthen. At la&s;t, after much anxiety, and very &s;erious con&s;ideration, it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;ix it on the middle of her forehead, re&s;embling the eye of a cyclope, and put a little one on the left &s;ide of her chin, bearing the likene&s;s of a mole.

<P>Ah! Fa&s;to&s;us, if the ladies only knew, how ri|diculous they make them&s;elves look in the eyes of the judi|cious, they would be very loath thus to deform their native beauty. What delicate beauty? What perfect comeline&s;s do we &s;ee rendered di&s;agreeable, and ridiculous by the&s;e transformations. And how can they be but di&s;agreeable and ridiculous, when all the decorations of nature lie concealed, and nothing appears but the manufactory of art, that great &s;upplanter of nature?

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No objection at all, cou&s;in; the &s;oul of a waiting woman will &s;ill a vacancy in hell, as well as that of her lady.

<P>If I remember right, Fa&s;to&s;us, when we parted la&s;t, you were relating the manner in which you made your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rance good among&s;t men; I &s;hould be glad, &s;ir, if you will be &s;o obliging as to fini&s;h that account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I purpo&s;e it. Avaro. You may remember I told you that, great Belzebub, having di&s;covered the woman, to be the weaker ve&s;&s;el, he made no attempts upon the vir|tue of the man, but re&s;olved, by all means to &s;educe the woman, not doubting but &s;he would bring over her hu&s;band to our intere&s;t along with her. It happened one night that Adam had a dream, ominous of our conque&s;t, which made him very fearful, le&s;t any part of his, or his wife's conduct, &s;hould promote the dire event; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erefore he rea&s;oned with her, concerning their duty to their Creator, gave her the &s;tricte&s;t charge, to keep out of the way of temptation, and withal informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that he was not without his fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even upon her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. But &s;he for her part, ju&s;t as the devil would have it, re&s;olved to &s;eparate her&s;elf, from her hu&s;band that day, which &s;he had never done before. Whether &s;he thought to endear her&s;elf more to him, by letting him &s;ee how well &s;he would re&s;i&s;t temptation, if any &s;hould offer, or took it rather ill, to be under his tutorage, I pretend not to &s;ay; but mangre all his intreaties, &s;he would go forth, by her&s;elf, into a di&s;tant walk, to gather &s;ome delicious berries, for an innocent repa&s;t for her and her lord, at noon.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity, ju&s;t to Belzebub's wi&s;h, and he took care to improve it to advantage. I told you before, that previous to this, he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the body of a beautiful &s;nake, in tho&s;e days man's familiar dome&s;tic; and now finding Eve at a di&s;tance from her hu&s;band, the &s;erpent
<PB N="89" REF="027249_0088_0FD3CDE5880135A8">di&s;covered him&s;elf to her, and with more than animal ge&s;|tures attracted her eye. Captivated with its unu&s;ual motion, &s;he &s;tood ravi&s;hed with its beauties, and admiring its agility. As it drew near to her, &s;he put forth her gentle hand, &s;troked its &s;kin, and the &s;ubtile animal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> after its manner, returned the compliment by laying its &s;hining head on her lap. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation was near to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, upon which the forbidden fruit luxuriou&s;ly hung. To this tree the &s;erpent frequently looked with all the langui&s;hment of ardent de&s;ire, till once be made &s;ure that the woman ob&s;erved it.

The woman an&s;wered, "No, we have never &s;o much as once ta&s;ted of it, but invariably ob|&s;erved the command of our great Creator, who hath put us into this garden, and &s;aid unto us, "Of every tree of the garden ye may freely eat, but the fruit of the tree of know|ledge, of good and evil, ye may not eat, for in the day ye eat thereof ye &s;hall &s;urely die." To whom the &s;erpent. "In|deed! Did he really &s;ay &s;o? Are you not mi&s;taken think you? Die too! why am not I dead then, I who have eaten of it &s;o plenteou&s;ly? No, no, you &s;hall not die. That is only an empty threatening to keep you in &s;ubjection to him; for he very well knows, that the moment you eat thereof, you &s;hall be like him&s;elf, knowing good and evil; no lon|ger be man and woman, but become gods."</P>
<P>The woman replied, "Aye, but my pretty creature, how &s;hall I know that I &s;hall be a godde&s;s, if I &s;hould ven|ture to eat of that de&s;irable fruit." "Know! &s;aid the &s;er|pent, you may ea&s;ily know it, if you con&s;ider that, if I, who was created only a brute bea&s;t, am by eating the fruit of this tree, exalted to humanity, you, who are more than half a God already, &s;hall certainly, by &s;o doing, be exalted to real divinity." With the&s;e words he injected into her bo&s;om &s;ome &s;eeds of my nature, which fermented to that de|gree, that nothing would now &s;erve her turn but to be dei|fied. Sagacious Belzebub, perceiving the uproar I had made in her mind, introduced all the train of real vices, which now infect the human &s;pecies; &s;ubjected her wholly to his &s;way, and &s;he as his in&s;trument, could have no re&s;t till &s;he got her hu&s;band's neck al&s;o fa&s;t in Belzebub's yoke.</P>
<P>Thus was pride fir&s;t introduced into the terrene creation, and thus was man &s;ubjected to my powerful &s;way. Being brought forth in the heart of man, I arrived in&s;tantly at full growth, involved them in &s;orrow, enveloped them in blind|ne&s;s

Every body ac|counted him to be a frantic enthu&s;ia&s;t, fanatic, or methodi&s;t; till the divine patience was quite worn out, and their de|&s;truction came upon them by a deluge, which &s;wept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">em all from the face of the earth, except this &s;ame Noah and his family; and for my part I do not remember a time, on which hell had &s;o many vi&s;itants at once as then.</P>

<P>But how could Noah and his family be &s;aved, when the deluge came upon all the earth?</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Avaro, it was by the help of a &s;hip, which he was taught to build. For this &s;ame Noah was the fir&s;t &s;hip-carpenter in the world, and although a prince, he was not above labouring with his hands. But it galls me to think, how the Almighty mixes mercy with judgment, for in this de&s;truction which he brought upon the old world, he taught the new world the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful art of naviga|tion, by means of which, he will &s;pread the knowledge of him&s;elf over all the earth.</P>
<P>After this I &s;et up my lofty &s;tandard on the plains of Shi|nar; multitudes flocked to it, and became my humble &s;er|vants. It was now. I projected the &s;cheme of erecting a tower equal in altitude to Jacob's ladder. Two &s;pecial ad|vantages I alledged to them would acerue from it when fi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hed. The fir&s;t to perpetuate their name to the late&s;t po|&s;terity;
<PB N="93" REF="027249_0092_0FD3EC10F953FAC8">the &s;econd and greate&s;t advantage would be, that thereby they might bid defiance to the Almighty. Such provi&s;ion being made for their &s;afety that, on the fir&s;t ap|pearances of judgment begun, they might retire to the tow|er, where the waters could not follow them. But here you may ob&s;erve, I played the devil with the children of men, for, although I flattered them with &s;uch advantages, I believ|ed in my heart, that &s;uch a pre&s;umptuous, daring undertak|ing, would have provoked the Almighty, utterly to have de&s;troyed them root and branch. And indeed at one time I thought I had gained my po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, for he did come down and confound their language in &s;uch a manner, that the great de&s;ign mi&s;carried. It was diverting to hear the bricklayer call for mortar, and lo, a box of brick was brought him; another calls for bricks, and the &s;erver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s for a board of mortar: one calls out for a level, and he receives a plumb|line; another a&s;ks for a &s;quare, and a level is brought him. The bricklayers, provoked to &s;ee them&s;elves mocked by their &s;ervants, not as yet knowing their language to be con|&s;ounded, began to lay their re&s;entment upon the bones of their labourers; and the labourers con&s;idering them&s;elves as very ill u&s;ed, returned the abu&s;e upon the builders, and thus they quarreiled and bickered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they were fain to leave off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he work, and beta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them&s;elves to other employments.</P>
<P>But alas! cou&s;in, in this affair the devil was outwitted; for we all thought that this haughty attempt would have pro|voked God utterly to de&s;troy them; but he made u&s;e of our project only to &s;end them abroad to people the earth, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> widely to make his glories known.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often, &s;ir, made honourable mention of the dutiful di&s;po&s;ition of my dear children, the French par&s;ons; but I had &s;ome years ago, occa&s;ion to try an experiment, which greatly quickened their devotion, and cloathed the face of all the country with poignant &s;orrow. By their un|wearied pur&s;uit of the intere&s;t of the church, that is to &s;ay, by their coaxing, wheedling, and threatening of people, out of their goods and chattles, for the benefit of the clergy; they were grown &s;o fat and pur&s;e-proud, they were not able to &s;ay half of the ma&s;&s;es they were paid for, nor to attend upon the duties of their pretended devotion; which per&s;i&s;t|ing in, they them&s;elves would have contributed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the open|ing of peoples eyes, to di&s;cover the cheat.</P>
<P>I imagined that nothing could be more &s;uitable, than phy|&s;ic, to purge off &s;ome of their gro&s;&s;ne&s;s. I went &s;traight to Ver&s;ailles, demanded an interview with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Louis, and accordingly was introduced by one of the lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his bed-chamber. As &s;oon as he had done me greeting after the royal manner, proportionable to his very great e&s;teem for me, I opened the conver&s;ation in the following manner: "My royal friend, &s;aid I, perceiving that you have been ran&s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the world lately in que&s;t of gold, to &s;upply your pre&s;&s;ing and growing wants, I am come to inform you where you may meet with &s;tore of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dores, yea, trea&s;ures in a|bundance,
<PB N="95" REF="027249_0094_0FD3EC150638DD70">without travelling out of your own dominions." "Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, I pray thee lovely &s;pirit, where are the golden heaps to be found?" I replied, "the clergy, the clergy, &s;ir, are &s;o overgrown in riches, that they are hardly able to &s;ay an ho&s;pitable ma&s;s for the dead, or even to go a|bout to cheat and defraud people out of their money and &s;ouls as heretofore." "Ungrateful villains, &s;aid he, to hoard up their money to lie by them u&s;ele&s;s, when I, their king, am ju&s;t at the point of becoming bankrupt. I'll ea&s;e them of their burden, I warrant you; I'll let them for once know, that they have another ma&s;ter be&s;ides the pope, and leave it to them to replace their &s;tores the neare&s;t way they can." I was not afraid but my &s;cheme would work to my mind, for I took him at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick of time, when the king of En|gland had emptied his coffers, by de&s;troying his naval force and trade; and poor gentleman he knew not well how to fill them again.</P>
<P>Glad of &s;uch an opportunity, he a&s;&s;embled the heads of the clergy, and demanded of them an exorbitant &s;um, in the way of a free gift; a very genteel way of robbing the church indeed. The holy gown&s;men, like dear children of their good Avaro, &s;howed them&s;elves as tenacious of their gold, as the paw of a lion is of its prey. They u&s;ed every argument which prie&s;tly &s;ubtilty could invent; they lugged in both heaven and earth as protectors of their property; yea, they even told him that to command them to part with their money, was no le&s;s than robbing the Almighty, ju&s;t as if the Almighty and them were partners in the trade of prie&s;tcraft. But clergymen have the advantage of all prin|ces in that, their cau&s;e is always the cau&s;e of God; although God, has in reality, nothing to do with them or it. They held both with teeth and hands, rather than generou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;overeign, though now become almo&s;t in&s;olvent. But you know the proverb, "The weaker goes to the wall;" and &s;o it was with them. He being &s;tronger than they, pre|vailed, and although their money came from their coffers
<PB N="96" REF="027249_0095_0FD3EC1840EA2950">like blood from their hearts, they were obliged to comply. But I can a&s;&s;ure you, the parting with it co&s;t them more real di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul, than ever the &s;elling of their con&s;ciences to obtain it had done. The &s;orrow of the prie&s;ts is for the mo&s;t part a farce, but their &s;orrow on this occa&s;ion, was deep and unfeigned.</P>
<P>It was not a great while after that, moidores failed a &s;e|cond time, and other re&s;ources being drained, he again had recour&s;e to the &s;ons of the clergy; and did by them as they commonly do by the laity. I mean, their money being gone, he was content with &s;tripping them of their plate; &s;o that were you now to &s;ee the cabin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of a French prie&s;t, you would find it as empty of plate as Gland the &s;hepherd's pantry. And I am of opinion, that Louis having found the way to their ne&s;t, he will take care, they be no more overgrown in riches. But to repair their late lo&s;&s;es they can now look out for a prey, with as much penetration as an eagle, and are rapid as a panther in &s;eizing on it.</P>

<P>I will &s;ir, and you may ob&s;erve that the fifth can|ton is that of the adulterers and fornicators. The&s;e are di|vided into literal and my&s;tical. The cla&s;s of literal adulter|ers and fornicators, are &s;o fa&s;hionable and notorious a peo|ple, that a de&s;cription of them &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary; and &s;o very di&s;agreeable, that it would be offen&s;ive to you. I &s;hall therefore do no more than de&s;cribe their dwelling, and a&s;|&s;ure you, &s;ire, that every individual of them is a very humble &s;ervant to your &s;on Impiator. Their dwelling is on the
<PB N="98" REF="027249_0097_0FD3EC1990E45B28">banks of a river, the &s;ource of which is in the court which runs through every part of the king's dominions, carrying the inhabitants along with it; and at la&s;t di&s;embogues it&s;elf in hell, where all adulterers and fornicators &s;hall infallibly be tormented, as a proper counter-balance for their fle&s;hly plea&s;ures; where in&s;tead of women, they &s;hall have devils; in&s;tead of wine, the &s;ulphurous liquid; and in&s;tead of beds of down, the boi&s;terous billows of Phlegethon.</P>
<P>Next to them are the my&s;tical adulterers and fornicators. By whom I mean, all that have any commerce with the whore of Rome, that old bawd with the &s;carlet gown: or in other words, all who have the mark of the bea&s;t, either on their foreheads, or their right hands, and &s;uch who have this mark upon both.</P>
<P>By tho&s;e who have the mark of the bea&s;t upon their fore|heads, I mean the worthy preachers and hearers of the Ar|minian doctrine of the church of Rome; as al&s;o the &s;trait|hooped gentlemen, who believe with the charitable Italians, that there can be no true faith but that which they profe&s;s, nor &s;alvation but in their community. The far greater part of the clergy belong to the former, and the good Sandema|nians, belong to the latter cla&s;s of doctrinal papi&s;ts, or my|&s;tical adulterers.</P>
<P>By the&s;e who have the mark of the bea&s;t upon their right hand, I mean the practical papi&s;ts; the whole bulk of the holy catholic church, and be&s;ides them, all that do the works of the bea&s;t, after the example of that orthodox church. By the works of the bea&s;t, &s;ome under&s;tand every part of religion which is not founded upon &s;cripture in&s;titution.

<P>Yes, &s;ir, they are di&s;tingui&s;hable enough: for the practical profe&s;t papi&s;ts, profe&s;s not the lea&s;t degree of rela|tion to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the head of the Chri&s;tian church, but own them&s;elves to be the adorers of the whore, who &s;its on many waters, are held to be the fornicators; whereas nominal prote&s;tants, profe&s;s them&s;elves married to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the great head of the Chri&s;tian church, and not|with&s;tanding this pretended marriage with him, maintain a doctrinal commerce with the whore of Rome; on which ac|count they are to be held as the adulterers.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth canton is the murderers habitation, which is divided into two grand divi&s;ions. In the fir&s;t are murderers of others, the&s;e are &s;ubdivided into petty cantons.

They are a people, who, without ju&s;t cau&s;e, are angry with their neighbours; this lambent flame they inwardly cheri&s;h, till revenge is begotten along with hatred, envy, and malice; with them, therefore, nothing is wanting but opportunity to de&s;troy the reputation and life of the object of their hatred, with &s;afety to them&s;elves; but very often it happens that their hatred and revenge de&s;troy their &s;ubjects, ere they have an opportunity of avenging them&s;elves. The verbal murderers live next to them, in a very &s;pacious country, becau&s;e they are very numerous. By the verbal murderers I mean, tho&s;e who withhold from the character of others, the good which they do deferve, and &s;peak of them the evil which they do not de&s;erve; or even the evil which they do de&s;erve, in a way, in which they would not wi&s;h others to &s;peak of them&s;elves, in like circum|&s;tances.

<P>I know them very well. A &s;mall body of de&s;pi&s;ed, preci&s;e creatures, hated by all the world&punc; I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, I have done all that lies in my power, to bring them under our dominion. But mortified I am to tell you, that I have never been able to conquer one of them. Immanuel hath publi&s;hed very &s;trict laws in his kingdom, ab&s;olutely pro|hibiting his &s;ubjects from touching, ta&s;ting, or handling any thing that belongs to us, or &s;o much as vi&s;iting our can|tons; and they are &s;o firmly attached to his government, that it is with the greate&s;t difficulty, now and then, we get one of them down into our mines. But when &s;uch a thing does happen, my &s;ubjects have a good day of fea&s;ting and mirth; &s;end gifts to one another, of &s;uch things as they have and the &s;houts of joy, "So we would have it," may be heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ll the cantons of our dominions.</P>
<P>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, it happened once that Noah, who was in the main, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ter enemy to our government, was induced to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the drunkards country, which cau&s;ed much gladne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the land. The triumphal flag was di&s;|played upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of Ham, wherever the news were
<PB N="107" REF="027249_0106_0FD3EC24696AC498">&s;pread, and every man reported to his neighbour, &s;aying, "Behold he is become like one of us." At the &s;ame time, the confederates of Shem, covered them&s;elves with &s;ack|cloth, put a&s;hes on their heads, exchanged their plea&s;ant &s;ongs for lamentations, mourning and woe; till the patriarch was &s;afely returned to his own country again.</P>
<P>It happened al&s;o o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a certain time, that I was happy e|nough to inveigie David the great, within the borders of the adulterers canton; who, to cover the infamy of &s;uch an ex|pedition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hed with violent precipitation into the very heart of the canton of murderers. The monarch's arrival was &s;oon proclaimed among all the murderers and adulter|ers, who made a grand entertainment on the occa&s;ion, and invited the bla&s;pheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to partake with them. Oh! Infide|lis, if you had been there, certainly you would have tired your &s;ides with laughing, to &s;ee how they footed the treble dance, whil&s;t the mu&s;ic played. "The be&s;t of them are as bad as our&s;elves" And all joined together in this chorus,
<Q><L>"What we do in public, they do in private,</L>
<L>"The difference is only in &s;hew."</L></Q> Then they clapped their hands, and &s;houted, "So, ho! brave boys Now we are all on one &s;ide. The man after God's own heart hath joined our communion. The p&s;alm|i&s;t of I&s;rael is now one of our&s;elves. Hypocrites altogether, who pretend to more religion than others. Thus, &s;ire, from the fall of one, our people concluded that all were bad.</P>
<P>The like fell out in the ca&s;e of Peter, the Apo&s;tle, who, on a very dark night, mi&s;&s;ing his way, was fir&s;t trapped in the liars &s;hare, and then in the &s;wearers gin, &s;o that he de|nied the Lord who bought him, and cur&s;ed and &s;wore, that he did not &s;o much as know je&s;us of Nazareth. I can tell you when &s;uch a thing does happen, that we entrap one of the Nazarenes, it greatly encrea&s;eth the indu&s;try of my &s;ub|jects, and bends them more than ever, under my yoke. Indeed, as there is no other way to Zion, but what lies
<PB N="108" REF="027249_0107_0FD3CD8D502B1D48">directly through the very heart of my dominions; there is now and then, one of them tumbles into our mines, e&s;peci|ally in the dark and long nights of winter.</P>

<P>No, &s;ir, I cannot &s;ay &s;o. I'll tell you how the mi&s;take happens. We frequently have companies of tho&s;e who are called Nazarenes, it is true; but then the name and the nature, are two different things, all the world over. In order to bring true Chri&s;tianity into di&s;grace: the great and wi&s;e Belzebub &s;tirs up &s;ome of our country people, to put on the outward habit of the Nazarenes, join their com|pany, and travel with them, almo&s;t to the borders of the kingdom of Profanity, but not one of them can be per&s;uad|ed to &s;et a foot out of their own country. As tho&s;e people pa&s;s along the road, in their own country, it is not much to be wondered at, if they do occa&s;ionally try their hands at their old employments. But as for the real Nazarenes, I a&s;&s;ure you, I very &s;eldom meet with one, who has curio|&s;ity &s;o much as to view our land as he pa&s;&s;es through it. E|ven when our &s;ubtile emi&s;&s;aries do entrap one, let me and my chivalry do what we can, we never detain him beyond a cer|tain time; when &s;ome powerful me&s;&s;enger is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;patched from the &s;kies, to deliver him out of our tenacious hands. But we have the &s;atisfaction of often procuring them an hearty drubbing, &s;o that many of them afterwards go halting to their graves. I my&s;elf, have &s;een Immanuel meet them, in the very mid&s;t of our kingdom, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ize, bind, and cha&s;ti&s;e them, till with blurred faces, they humbly &s;ubmitted to ki&s;s the rod, and heartily ble&s;&s;ed God, that ever the birch-tree was planted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, child, they are made to ki&s;s the rod, that is, the plagne of it; for then they bid farewell to the plea&s;ures of Profant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. Oh! were it but po&s;&s;ible, by any means, to harden them again&s;t the rod, what advantages might we reap from it! Of indeed could we, as I have often &s;trove
<PB N="109" REF="027249_0108_0FD3EC2A8811A898">to do, make them faint under it; it would an&s;wer the &s;ame end: but, beyond all our power to hinder, Immanuel does &s;ome how, along with the &s;troke, convey &s;u&s;taining &s;trength. Yea, &s;ometimes, even makes the rod it&s;elf, in &s;ome re&s;pects, plea&s;ant, and at all times profitable to them. Ah! my &s;on, we &s;hall never be able to rob him of one of his own, for when he cha&s;ti&s;eth them with a vi&s;ible hand, he &s;u&s;taineth, and comforteth them with an hand invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>But let us not be di&s;couraged, nor yield the conte&s;t. Let us de&s;troy whom we can, and let us di&s;turb, and di&s;tract the minds of tho&s;e whom we cannot de&s;troy. Let us think of the great Belzebub, what atchievements he is daily perform|ing, notwith&s;tanding he groans in the yoke of eternal de&s;pair? And for your encouragement, my dear Impiator, let me tell you, &s;uch is your care, to maintain a de&s;potic &s;way over your &s;ubjects, and &s;uch is their attachment to your per&s;on and go|vernment, that both you and they may be a&s;&s;ured of warm lodgings in the palace of great Belzebub, as &s;oon as this world cea&s;eth to be the &s;tage of action.</P>

<P>I am amazed, at the a&s;toni&s;hing powers of this in&s;trument, when it is u&s;ed one way, it magnifies a molehill to a &s;tupendous mountain, and a tennis ball to a world; and when u&s;ed the contrary way, it reduceth an oak of the mo&s;t gigantic &s;tature, into one of the mo&s;t dwarfi&s;h &s;hrubs. I pray you, cou&s;in, what is the name of this in&s;trument? And where was it invented?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the name of this amazing in&s;trument, is PRE|JUDICE, it was invented by Lucifer, the mo&s;t famous ma|thematician in hell; is of excellent u&s;e, in forwarding the delightful works of darkne&s;s, and &s;ecuring the dominion of Belzebub, over mankind upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear cou&s;in, I am quite impatient to have a de&s;|cription of its u&s;es; it cannot fail being of excellent &s;ervice, if &s;kilfully managed, as I doubt not it is, in the hand of Di&s;|cordans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, having already &s;een &s;omething of its amazing effects, you may well believe it is very u&s;eful to me. By this partial gla&s;s, it is, I &s;ow contention, &s;trife, and di&s;cord, wherever I come. It is my cu&s;tom, when I begin my ope|rations, and intend to &s;et people together by the ears, to vi|&s;it
<PB N="117" REF="027249_0116_0FD3EC2B8E06BA90">each of them &s;eparately; apply my gla&s;s to his eye, in the magnifying way, and as you &s;ee, it is &s;o con&s;tructed, that it will turn any way. I turn it towards him&s;elf, by which he obtains a partial view of his own virtue and merit. Then I apply the gla&s;s the contrary way, and direct my dupe to con|&s;ider his vices in the dimini&s;hing medium, by which he al|mo&s;t, if not wholly, loo&s;eth &s;ight of them. Having had &s;uch a partial view of his own virtues and vices, the fool takes the former to be a thou&s;and times greater, and the latter a thou&s;and times le&s;s, than they really are; by the&s;e means he is &s;o prejudiced, in his own favour, &s;o far, that he is rea|dy to quarrel with all who think not as well of him as he does of him&s;elf
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A recent in&s;tance of this effect of &s;elf-e&s;teem, the author met with in his neare&s;t religious connections, which he thinks meet to add to tho&s;e in&s;tances of more ancient date.</NOTE>. Thus, I prejudice almo&s;t every man in his own favour, &s;o far, that each looks upon him&s;elf as mo&s;t worthy of general regard. From this, it is, that you may meet with a drummer who looks upon him&s;elf as more able to command well, than his colonel; or a catchpole, who deems him&s;elf fit for an alderman; and a &s;curvy attorney, who flatters him&s;elf, that he knows more than the lord chan|cellor of the realm.</P>
<P>But for this prejudice in their own favour, you &s;hould never hear of revolutions of &s;tate, de&s;tructive wars, cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and dome&s;tic broils, among&s;t man|kind &s;o grateful to us infernal &s;pirits. 'Tis by this device, you will find one fool wi&s;er in his own conceit, than ten men who can render a rea&s;on. Yea, gentlemen, it is from the good opinion almo&s;t every man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of him&s;elf, originally derived from the u&s;e of my partial tele&s;cope, that all divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities of every kind, and among&s;t ev|ery people in church and &s;tate do flow. Though indeed, the gentlemen concerned in religious contentions, would per|&s;uade the world, that it is the glory of God, and the further|ance of the go&s;pel they have in view, in all their cur&s;es and
<PB N="118" REF="027249_0117_0FD3EC5714D21018">anathemas, which they to&s;s and reto&s;s again&s;t one another; the vulgar take it for granted to be &s;o, and therefore readi|ly join with their reverend leaders.</P>
<P>In the mean while, man being &s;ufficiently prejudiced in his own favor, I betake me to the following operations from whence all jealou&s;ies, back-bitings, murmuring, evil-&s;urmi|&s;ings, &amp;c. &s;pring. I put the dimini&s;hing end of my tele|&s;cope to the eye of my dupe, and direct him thus, to be|hold the virtue of his neighbour. The in&s;tance of the oak, reduced to the mo&s;t diminutive &s;hrub, will convince you that a man's virtue will appear little enough, if at all di&s;|cernable, when viewed with my partial gla&s;s. So when the man with it examines the virtue of his neighbours, he is put to his wits end to find any virtue at all, ju&s;t as you were to find out the oak: but he &s;ees, as he thinks, too much cau&s;e to conclude, that his neighbour is a very bad man. And if &s;uch a thing &s;hould be, that a man's virtue is &s;o &s;trong, that it forceth evidence, even over the belly of prejudice, by its own native lu&s;tre; its appearance is chan|ged from its reality, as the oak to the &s;hrub, in the forego|ing experiment.</P>
<P>Then I direct my di&s;ciple to apply the magnifying end of the tele&s;cope, and to take an ample view of his neigh|bour's vices and deformity; and this he doth to the greate&s;t advantage; the two in&s;tances of a mole-hill transformed to a mountain, and a rolling ball to a revolving world, will convince you, how glaring any man's vices will be, when viewed with the magnifying end of my valuable tele&s;cope, Prejudice.</P>
<P>On obtaining this di&s;covery, &s;ays my dupe, "Ah! how glaring his vices appear! when I &s;ought for virtue, I could not di&s;cern &s;o much as the &s;malle&s;t of her traces in him; but now I &s;eek for his vices, truly there is nothing el&s;e to be &s;een. Can this man be a Chri&s;tian? No, &s;urely! If this be Chri&s;tianity, I will for ever renounce it." Thus, my ve|ry reverend uncle, I frequently per&s;uade people who are
<PB N="119" REF="027249_0118_0FD3EC5887DACDA0">really worthle&s;s, to de&s;pi&s;e, revile, and contemn tho&s;e who are in every re&s;pect much preferable to them&s;elves; to deny the character of virtuous men, even to the mo&s;t virtuous of their day.</P>

<P>This gla&s;s is really more wonderful than the former. What an amazing power of invertion it hath, cou&s;in? Why it transformeth light into darkne&s;s, and darkne&s;s into light; changeth the appearance of devils, into that of angels of

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, &s;ir, I call my inverting mirror; but the proper name of it is FALSE REASONING: An in&s;trument of the true Luciferian con&s;truction, and mo&s;t admirably a|dapted to my dividing purpo&s;es. It is the oracle at which, for the mo&s;t part, mankind enquire after the truth of any matter; but from what you have &s;een you will readily be|lieve, that there is no truth in it; therefore its di&s;coveries, if the truth were known, would be deemed ab&s;olute fal&s;e|hood. But I am very careful to keep up its honour with the people, as I could do but little bu&s;ine&s;s without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, my &s;on; and it proves to be in high e|&s;teem; for the ancients were not more fond of our brother Apollo, who kept his court at Delphos, than the moderns are of the inverting mirror of Fal&s;e Rea&s;oning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good cou&s;in, a word or two, concerning its u&s;es, yea, make an oration of it, if you plea&s;e; for it will be very agreeable, even to Impiator him&s;elf, I dare &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>No danger of me, I a&s;&s;ure you! I begin now to have &s;ome ca&s;te for information, all that I have heard being &s;o very agreeable. Cou&s;in Di&s;cordans, you may freely pro|ceed, without any fear of bearing too hard upon my patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for this inverting mirror, gentlemen, I could do but little again&s;t the children of men; for excellent as my tele&s;cope of Prejudice is, it would be altogether u&s;ele&s;s, but for the mirror: but by the help of this, the tele&s;cope per|formeth mighty deeds in favour of our government.</P>
<P>By this mirror it is, I cau&s;e offence to be taken, when none is offered, nor de&s;igned; yea, even when the good of the party is &s;ought after; and thus I ferment differences, a|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t the mo&s;t fervent &s;olicitations for unity. A certain great man, &s;ome thou&s;and years &s;ince, had &s;uch a proof of this, that he complained bitterly again&s;t our people, &s;aying, "When I am for peace, they are for war."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="027249_0120_0FD3EC5C87FE43C0">
By this mirror it is, that public or private reproof is not only rendered u&s;ele&s;s but even hurtful to the party reproved, and frequently prejudicial to &s;ociety. So very much are people given to examine all matters in our famous mirror, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to point out one man in a whole county who hath wi&s;dom enough to bear reproof with be|coming patience. So that if it is an argument of folly, to turn away the car from reproof, or to harden the heart a|gain&s;t rebuke, the&s;e are brave days for folly.</P>
<P>By this wonderful mirror, I make even the preached word, not only u&s;ele&s;s to many, but offen&s;ive to &s;ome: for in&s;tance, it &s;ometimes happens, that the preacher, as it is his duty, exclaims again&s;t drunkenne&s;s, at that in&s;tant I &s;tep up to the drunkard, hold the mirror before his eyes; immediately he begins to view the par&s;on's conduct in a very uncharitable light, and as a guilty con&s;cience needs no accu&s;er, he con|cludes it is him&s;elf that is aimed at. "Well, &s;ays he, I &s;ee how it is &s;ome &s;piteful per&s;on hath told him that I was drunk the other night, and he is wicked enough to expo&s;e me to all the congregation. Has he no faults of his own, that he can be &s;o free in trumping up other people's failings? Cannot he preach the go&s;pel without railing again&s;t individuals?"</P>

<P>By this time, I clap my tele&s;cope to his eye, and direct him to view the par&s;on with it; which is no &s;ooner done, than he exclaims, "Aye, aye, his vices are as great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mine! and greater too. If he is not a drunkard, he is &s;omething as bad; he is covetous, all know that; and he is uncharitable and &s;piteful." Then I turn the end of my tele&s;cope towards him&s;elf. "Well, &s;aith he, the par&s;on him&s;elf is more wicked by one half than I am, I meddle with no man's character, I am in charity with all men.&mdash; I am ju&s;t and hone&s;t in all my dealings.

<P>With all my heart, &s;ir. The fir&s;t in&s;tance I re|member, was in the ca&s;e of Cain and Abel. As for Abel, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was a rebel again&s;t our government, enli&s;t|ed under the banner of Immanuel, and bore arms again&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="027249_0122_0FD3EC62A9D9AB38">the monarch of darkne&s;s, to whom tru&s;ty Cain was firmly anached. Abel was well acquainted with the acceptable atone|ment, then to be made by Je&s;us of Nazareth, and had re|&s;pect to it, in all the &s;ervices which he offered to deity; his &s;acrifices and &s;ervices were therefore the fruits of faith, and con&s;equently acceptable to God whom he &s;erved. On the other hand, our friend Cain had no re&s;pect to the media|tion of Immanuel, but con&s;idered his &s;ervices as well de|&s;erving acceptance with the Deity, in virtue of their own in|trin&s;ic excellence. Of cour&s;e both him and his &s;ervices were rejected; for you know, whatever is not of faith, is &s;in, and con&s;equently dete&s;table to the Almighty. Abel offered his &s;acrifice, and Cain pre&s;ented his gift; the one in faith, and the other without faith; the re&s;ult was, Abel was accepted and Cain rejected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was aware of this, and &s;aw di&s;content vi&s;ible upon his countenance, I went up to Cain, and began to ply him with my in&s;trument. "Let my lord Cain, &s;aid I, try his brother's conduct in this faithful mirror; accord|ingly he viewed it, and as he viewed, he &s;aid, "Ah! now I &s;ee how it is,&mdash;he knew that a lamb, or kid, would be more acceptable to God than corn; he would not inform me, I &s;uppo&s;e, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ing: Is this acting the part of a brother? I &s;ee now through all his pretended love, his whining advices, and hypocritical cant."</P>
<P>This wrought ju&s;t as I would have had it. Then I de&s;ir|ed him to view him&s;elf with my tele&s;cope, which he did, and thus exclaimed, "Why, I am a thou&s;and times better than my brother Abel! I have as much righteou&s;ne&s;s in my one hand, as he hath in his whole per&s;on." Said I, "Now take a full view of your brother with this gla&s;s." He did, and as he looked, he &s;aid, "My brother is the mo&s;t con|temptible creature I ever beheld. I wonder not now to hear him complain of his unworthine&s;s, as he does in his whining way." "Look again, I &s;aid." Then &s;aid Cain, "Why,
<PB N="124" REF="027249_0123_0FD3EC3DF96AA390">Abel is &s;o &s;welled with pride, that he cannot contain him|&s;elf." "Look farther," &s;aid I: "Aye, replied he, I &s;ee what he aims at. He thinks I &s;hall be his &s;ervant, and no longer his &s;uperior as elder brother."</P>
<P>You know it is u&s;ual for my worthy friends, Envy, Re|venge, and Cruelty, to follow me in mo&s;t of my enterprizes. It &s;o fell out, at this time, that tho&s;e three diabolians were pre&s;ent, but none of them attempted to &s;peak a word, till Cain had viewed his brother Abel with my in&s;truments, in a light the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous to him that could be. But Cain having obtained this view of Abel, up comes Envy and thus addre&s;t him: "Friend Cain, I am heartily &s;orry for your di&s;grace, and am grieved when I ob&s;erve to you, that it is my opinion you will never be able to endure your bro|ther's greatne&s;s and pro&s;perity, now he is accepted, and you are rejected. I am much mi&s;taken, if his ambition cea&s;eth to operate, till he en&s;laves you entirely under his yoke. I much fear that is what he aims at Now, my friend, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you are the elder born, it is but rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould be ruler; but for the elder to be &s;ubject to the younger, is what I would advi&s;e you never to &s;ubmit to." Then &s;aid Revenge, if hone&s;t Cain will be ruled by me, he will make him&s;elf a|mends for all the grief he has &s;u&s;tained. To whom Cain. "I pray thee, thou &s;weet &s;pirit, which way &s;hall I do it? Shall I burn his tents, de&s;troy his flocks? what &s;hall I do, to make my&s;elf amends?" Do, &s;aid Crudelis, what &s;hould you do? Knock him on the head at once: "El&s;e, &s;aid Envy, he will be an eye-fore to you all the days of your life."</P>
<P>Thus the matter was determined, and accordingly Cain took an opportunity one day in the field to murder him. In this in&s;tance, Abel's virtue and faith were con&s;idered as vi|cious craftine&s;s; his &s;incere aiming at the glory of God, and his &s;elf-denial were by my inverting in&s;truments interpreted pride and ambition. Deluded Cain revenged him&s;elf not according to reality, but according to his own jealous &s;u&s;pi|cions, and groundle&s;s &s;urmi&s;es.</P>

<P>I remember I made rude work between Jacob's wives; I think their names were Leab and Rachel, the daughters of your friend Laban, Avaro; and that too, for what neither one, nor the other could po&s;&s;ibly help. Rachel was plump, fair and beautiful, but withal for many years barren.

But to pa&s;s from the di&s;cord of the women. I come to their &s;ons, among&s;t whom I made a pretty &s;ort of an inroad, which for a &s;ea&s;on yielded me ex|qui&s;ite plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know it is always more plea&s;ure to me to &s;tir up di&s;cord among the good and virtuous, than any people what|ever, although by the way, it is much more irrational in them to quarrel with one another, than for tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to equal privileges. Yet &s;uch is my dexterity, that whil&s;t they are in this world. I can make them very often behave to one another, more like enemies than friends and brethren. However, they e&s;cape my tyranny the mo|ment they for&s;ake their clay, and I am forever bani&s;hed from their peaceful man&s;ions in the other world.</P>
<P>To return to my &s;tory. Young Jo&s;eph, &s;on of the decea&s;ed Rachel, was his father's favourite; and the fond patriarch, to evidence his di&s;tingui&s;hing regard to him, clothed him in garments of many colours. This badge of affection &s;at very unea&s;y on the minds of his brethren, who, to a man, re&s;olved to teach future parents the folly of partiality towards their children; yet had conduct enough to bridle their re&s;entment,
<PB N="126" REF="027249_0125_0FD3ECBBB16D59D0">till a favourable opportunity &s;hould offer. It was not many years, before an opportunity offered; for Jo&s;eph had a dream, divinely in&s;pired, of which! made very &s;uitable improve|ment. He dreamed, "that he and his brethren were all reaping together in the field, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o! ere he was aware, his &s;heaf &s;tood upright in the mid&s;t, and all his brethrens &s;heaves, &s;tood round and made obei&s;ance to it."</P>
<P>Young Jo&s;eph, &s;u&s;pecting no harm, in his &s;implicity told his dream to his brethren. Not long after he dreamed, that the &s;un, moon, and eleven &s;tars, made obei&s;ance to him; and in the &s;ame &s;implicity of heart told his brethren this dream al&s;o, never once &s;u&s;pecting that they would comment upon it to his injury.</P>
<P>At this time, I happened to make a vi&s;it to them, and having the matter without re&s;erve laid before me, I reque&s;t|ed them to examine it with my in&s;truments, as you know I am never backward when there is any hope of bu&s;ine&s;s. As they examined it, they were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the hanghty boy was but too &s;en&s;ible of his father's over-e&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eem for him. "Vain youth, &s;aid they, he can think of nothing, but being lord over his brethren: It is evident from his repeated dreams, his mind runs upon it through the day; for what people ruminate in the day, they are apt to dream of at night." Such was the &s;en&s;e my mirror gave of the af|fair. Then &s;aid I, Gentlemen, be plea&s;ed to &s;urvey the mat|ter with this tele&s;cope, meaning Prejudice. They did &s;o, and &s;aid, "Did ever any body &s;ee &s;uch an haughty pre&s;ump|tuous youth, as this &s;tripling of a brother of ours is? It may be the young ambitions wretch feigned his dreams, the more ea&s;ily to introduce his &s;upremacy! He be our lord! Mo&s;t he? His pride is boundle&s;s. It is not enough, that he hopes to lord it over his brethren, but his old father mu&s;t, it &s;eems, make obei&s;ance to his arrogance.</P>
<P>It was now I called on my brother Revenge to appear; to whom I willed them to make their ca&s;e known. This they did, and he, without he&s;itation (as you know he is a rea|dy
<PB N="127" REF="027249_0126_0FD3EC34821B2388">witted &s;pirit) gave them his advice: "Gentlemen, &s;aid he, the fact is evident; but why do you perplex yourlelves?

"By all means, &s;aid Envy, for you &s;ee the old man is &s;o doatingly foud of him, that he is ready to take his dreams to be divinely in|&s;pired; and the more fooli&s;hly the youth can dream the fonder his father is of him; &s;o that it is now, if Jo&s;eph is well, he cares <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle what becomes of the re&s;t of his children."</P>

<P>I am ready to do any thing, that tends to the pro|&s;perity of our common cau&s;e; with a view to this I have already given Impiator &s;ome account of my birth and fir&s;t enterprizes, and now for common in&s;truction &s;hall pro|ceed. Having a&s;cended the throne of Infidelity, the fir&s;t thing I attempted was, to lull men into a per&s;ua&s;ion that I did not at all exi&s;t, and that there is no &s;uch devil as unbe|lief in being. When I could not &s;o univer&s;ally prevail in this as I wi&s;hed, I endeavoured to per&s;uade each of them &s;eparately, that bowever In&s;idelis might reign over others, for their part, he had no dominion over them. For, &s;aid I, you have a good heart, and have believed well all your days. Although, as I &s;aid before, I have conducted many of tho&s;e, who fancied they had believed &s;o well in their life|time, very &s;afely down to the chambers of horrible de&s;pair, where they were very &s;oon convinced, they had never be|lieved at all aright.</P>
<P>Then I endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that the threatnings of God's law again&s;t &s;in, ought to be con&s;i|dered as a fancy, and, to &s;trengthen this doctrine, I thus preached: (for you mu&s;t know, I have been a great preach|er in my time) "Look you, you timerous minded mortals; you may clearly &s;ee, that God hath created you, with all the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites that attend you, and can you be|lieve that he did this, with a de&s;ign to prohibit the gratifi|cation of them? No, &s;urely! Could it be con&s;i&s;tent with the character of that God, who&s;e goodne&s;s is unto all, and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works, to endow you with the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, and then damn you for gratifying them? No, no, tho&s;e threatuings are exhibited only to keep your con&s;ciences in awe; but never de&s;igned to be rigorou&s;ly executed.&mdash;The law will make large allowances for the inclinations, pa&s;&s;ions, and infir|mities of the human nature; never &s;ear it. The &s;oul that

<P>Here, gentlemea, you may &s;ee my falacy, in dealing with mortals, for although all the faculties and pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul were indeed e&s;&s;ential to its creation &s;tate, none of them were then irregular; none acted from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">proper in|fluence, for every pa&s;&s;ion centred in its lawful and proper object Be&s;ides, all &s;inful motions and de&s;ires of the heart are the effects of my dominion over man.</P>
<P>Then I proceeded to per&s;uade them, that God had for&s;ak|en the earth, and took now no notice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of men, &s;o that every man might, with the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, gratify his peculiar inclination.

<P>I per&s;uaded men that this world is the mo&s;t certain good. A bird in the hand, &s;aid I, is worth two in the bu&s;h. Make &s;ure of this world, and never &s;ear for the o|ther. Do you con&s;ider this as your abiding place and build your ne&s;t in its highe&s;t branches if po&s;&s;ible. In this I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that every man by nature, and almo&s;t all by practice, look upon the pre&s;ent world as the chiefe&s;t good. Then it was that Avaro was born in our family, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbitio&s;us was born in the family of a&s;to&s;us.</P>
<P>All this, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, I did in di&s;gui&s;e, or rather in a &s;tate of invi&s;ibility; I dare not tell a man, when I wait upon him, that my name is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfidelis; for although they are fond of my nature, even to di&s;traction, there is not one of them but what hates to be told that he is cou|cerned with me.

<P>It is no manner of difficulty for me to lurk un|perceived by them, in the corners of their dwellings: but I cannot po&s;&s;ibly hide my&s;elf from Mo&s;es the vicegerent of the Highe&s;t. He is a per&s;on of a mo&s;t piercing eye, and can trace all the motions of &s;pirit, therefore it comes to pa&s;s that he and I, have frequent bickerings. Mo&s;es being the perfection of light, and I the mo&s;t con&s;ummate dark|ne&s;s, there is an eternal war proclaimed betwixt us, and we never meet but we are at daggers drawing.</P>
<P>Sometimes he comes knocking with a tremendous ham|mer at the doors and windows of my lodging, as if he would lay the hou&s;e in an heap of ruin, whil&s;t the people within, &s;tart and tremble, at every thunder-clap of his ham|mer. Amid&s;t their con&s;ternation you may hear him from without, call to them within, with a voice louder than ma|ny thunders, in the name of his augu&s;t Ma&s;ter, to bring forth the devil Infidelis, and all his train, to public execution. But I am always well befriended by the people of the hou&s;e, who, for the mo&s;t part, tell him that neither Infidelis, nor any of his train, live with them, and that his excellency mu&s;t needs have mi&s;taken the door. They tell him, he would do better, to enquire at the hou&s;e of Tom Drunkard, or Jack the &s;wearer, where very probably, &s;ay they, that evil &s;pirit may dwell.</P>
<P>This is often the beginning of a rupture betwixt him and them, for he is not to be &s;o ea&s;ily deceived; he &s;hooteth his burning arrows, with deathly vengeance, in at the win|dows again&s;t the people of the hou&s;e, who I exhort, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to re&s;i&s;t to the la&s;t extremity. Never did you &s;ee the warlike Cor&s;icans exert them&s;elves with &s;uch ardour in defence of their liberties, as my &s;ubjects in defence of my government.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="027249_0132_0FD3EC6A9C8306C8">
Sometimes they &s;o be&s;mear his heavenly face, with the filth they throw upon him, calling him &s;evere tyrant covetous ex|tortioner, unju&s;t villain, and the like, that he gives over the a&s;&s;ault, and leaves them to my quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; then I take my &s;eal, and &s;eal them to de&s;truction; for you mu&s;t know, it is but in &s;ome places he exerts his unfru&s;trable influence.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable, that, although my &s;ubjects will give Mo&s;es a good character, while he keeps at a di&s;tance from them, every one, will &s;ight to the knees in blood, when a&s;&s;aulted by him, ere they &s;ubmit; &s;o fond are they of my per&s;on and government, Sometimes it hath happened, that, by irre&s;i&s;table force he hath broke open the doors, &s;eized the people of the hou&s;e by the collar, dragged them to the brink of a pit, called De&s;pondency, into which he tumbled them headlong, and le&s;t them &s;hut up in that drea|ry dungeon.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he is departed, I go to work, and turn &s;ome neighbouring brook into the pit, with a de&s;ign to drown them, or throw down earth, &s;tones, &amp;c. on purpo&s;e to &s;mother them; and &s;o I continue to pe&s;ter, and di&s;turb them, till I am frightened away by the &s;ound of Immanuel's trumpet, as he him&s;elf approaches for their deliverance; for you mu&s;t know, I cannot &s;tand my ground, but take to my heels, when he appears. Many a time, do I hear my|&s;elf cur&s;ed for an helli&s;h brat, even by tho&s;e, who but very lately, would have ri&s;ked life and fortune, and with the greate&s;t bravery fought, in the cau&s;e of prince Infidelis: but as &s;oon as they obtain a glimp&s;e of Immanuel's glory, they have done with my yoke, and I lo&s;e their affection for ever.</P>
<P>However, as I cannot endure that rational &s;cripture light &s;hould &s;hine in the hearts of men, I have often been puz|zled to find out proper methods to re&s;i&s;t the power of Mo&s;es, for he is exce&s;&s;ively turbulent &s;ometimes, and frighteneth my &s;ubjects into a pretended &s;ervice of his
<PB N="134" REF="027249_0133_0FD3EC6C06D999E0">Lord. In order to appea&s;e him, the &s;ons of men agreed to build a temple, and dedicate it to the Mo&s;t High; ra|ther choo&s;ing to wor&s;hip him, than be de&s;troyed by the ar|tillery of Sinai. Accordingly to work they went, and built a &s;umptuous dome for divine wor&s;hip, in order to &s;top the mouth of that never-cea&s;ing accu&s;er. Now, though I. things are likely to take an awkward turn with me; if this wor&s;hip is not interrupted, I &s;hall lo&s;e many of my pre&s;ent &s;laves. So I put my plodding brain to the torture, in order to find out proper methods of prevention; and I can tell you, gentlemen, I went wi&s;ely to work; you re|member that, Avaro, for you were my helper.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e was this. We prepared the image of a woman, fair and beautiful to the eye; the was inwardly made of clay, and outwardly adorned with the appearance of burni&s;h|ed gold; in her right hand was a regal &s;ceptre, titles of &s;tate, and plumes of honour, &amp;c. In her left &s;he carried a heavy pur&s;e of money, and a ca&s;k of oriental jewels; upon her head was an imperial crown, &s;tudded with &s;parkling gems, which dazzled the eye of beholders, whil&s;t they read the following motto, which was written, in all languages, on her forehead; "I am the mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole world." We &s;ecretly conveyed this image into one corner of the tem|ple, and placed it in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;een of all who entered.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived that the bait was &s;uitably dre&s;t, and our idol had charms enough to attract the attention of the people.

<P>No, no, he is none of your ea&s;y tempered people, I a&s;&s;ure you: his eagle-eye &s;oon di&s;covered the cheat, and as &s;oon did he re&s;olve on vengeance, as appeared by the event.

<P>This &s;aid, he hurled his brands among&s;t the people, and terribly di&s;turbed many of them; indeed it was &s;ome|thing alarming to &s;ee them &s;o gha&s;tly, and tremble at his fearful menaces. In their fir&s;t alarm, they were for re|moving the godde&s;s out of the temple, for fear of immedi|ate de&s;truction; but being a little recovered from their fright, the far greater part found &s;uch relenting towards her lady&s;hip, that they could not bear the thoughts of part|ing with her, believing &s;till, in de&s;pite of Mo&s;es, that her comely pre&s;ence, was highly nece&s;&s;ary, to render religion tolerable; and rather than part with her, they re&s;olved to part with the temple of God it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some few of them indeed, were re&s;olute for her removal, deeming the urgent command of the heavenly accu&s;er, not at all unrea&s;onable, but their company was very incon&s;i|derable, and their &s;trength inadequate to the enterprize: when they attempted to remove her, they could not &s;o much as move her feet off from the pede&s;tal; and not|with&s;tanding the command was urgent, the far greater part of the people could not help, even in the mid&s;t of their devotion: looking towards the idol, with an approving

<P>Yes, Avaro, the times are not to be complained of; nor indeed have they been bad, for many hundred of years, if circum&s;tances are duly attended to. But to my &s;tory. In proce&s;s of time, men became &s;en&s;ible, that, unle&s;s the heart was fixed upon God, in acts of religious wor&s;hip, their &s;ervices could not be acceptable; but how to fix them they could not find. Being afraid, the re&s;ult of their en|quiries might prove dangerous to my intere&s;t, if not inter|rupted. I advi&s;ed them to make to them&s;elves repre&s;enta|tions of God, in wood, &s;tone, bra&s;s, or iron, but rather of &s;ilver, or gold; alledging that the more valuable the metal, the more acceptable the &s;acrifice would be.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of men no &s;ooner heard than approved of my &s;cheme, and re&s;olved forthwith to put it into execution. Then ere you were aware every village was furni&s;hed with one or two god-makers, a &s;et of artificers, from whom our pre&s;ent &s;aint-makers in Italy, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. are de&s;cended; for modern times have not changed, but only given a different name to this craft, by which the popi&s;h par&s;ons get their wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="027249_0136_0FD3EC73D72EF3A8">
But, alas! having never &s;een the &s;hape of God, at any time, they were obliged to form their images, in the mould of their own fancies, which being various, it came to pa&s;s, that in one place, the invi&s;ible Deity was likened to an old man, with a venerable long beard, gra&s;ping a bunch of reeds, which they called thunder. In another place he was repre|&s;ented as half man and half bea&s;t; yea, &s;o curious were the fancies of the arti&s;ts that in one place God Almighty was made like a fi&s;h, in another like an eagle or hawk, and in another like a log of wood, and indeed &s;ometimes like a bea&s;t with four feet. So very bri&s;kly was this trade carried on, that all who were able to buy, had in a few years, one or more god-almighties, of man's making, in their own hou&s;es. The very &s;ame as our good friends the papi&s;ts, have got almo&s;t every one, a &s;aviour in his pocket or chamber. In the holy Roman church, you may find in every hou&s;e, a Je&s;us Chri&s;t of one kind or another, for there, there be many &s;orts of Je&s;us Chri&s;ts, as golden Je|&s;us Chri&s;ts, &s;ilver Je&s;us Chri&s;ts, wooden and even paper Je&s;us Chri&s;ts, all made with as much craft as the ancient pagan gods.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That trade of &s;hrine, making among the papi&s;ts, is a good &s;ort of trade, but I can tell you it falls far &s;hort of the craft of &s;aint wor&s;hipping, by which the prie&s;ts get their wealth. Many a wooden &s;aint there is in the holy church, which hath brought into the prie&s;t's trea&s;ury above &s;ix times its weight in gold. And indeed the pagan prie&s;ts reaped equal benefit from their gods, from whence we learn that prie&s;tcraft hath been the &s;ame in all ages.</P>

<P>Some people there were of more refined know|ledge than their neighbours, who advi&s;ed again&s;t the trade of god-making, &s;aying. "We mu&s;t not bow down to graven nor moiten images, nor in any wi&s;e wor&s;hip them." My prie&s;ts, according to my directions, an&s;wered as follows; "It is not the image which you wor&s;hip, nor do you at all
<PB N="138" REF="027249_0137_0FD3EC750C8E4390">bow your knee to it; but being emblematical of the divine pre&s;ence, it greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts you in your devotion." This learn|ed rea&s;oning calmed the con&s;ciences of mo&s;t of the di&s;&s;ent|ers; won them over to the religion by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, and greatly wrought for the good of the church.</P>

<P>Why, &s;ir, that is the very apology which the papi&s;ts make for image-wor&s;hip, relict-adoration, &amp;c. but indeed it is no wonder, &s;eeing their religion is one and the &s;ame with that of the pagans.</P>

<P>Some few there were, rigid non-conformi&s;ts, who in&s;i&s;ted, that God mu&s;t be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and in truth; in&s;i&s;ted that all idolatrous lumber &s;hould be ca&s;t out of the temple; by which the worthy clergymen of that age were &s;o grievou&s;ly galled, that they were forced, in a pious and tender manner, fir&s;t to give up the heretics to the devil, and then put the fle&s;h to death, for the &s;alvation of the &s;oul: in the very &s;ame manner (and for much the &s;ame cau&s;e) as the holy Roman fathers excommunicated and burned the pro|te&s;tants. But the devil knows to his &s;ad experience, that the church has not half the power the pretends to, for out of the va&s;t numbers, which &s;he hath generou&s;ly given to him, it is but a very few he hath been able to receive: notwith|&s;tanding both the pagan, papal, and other churches, have hereby &s;hewn the good-will which all along they have borne to him and his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Having fairly introduced idolatry, I tried, if po&s;&s;ible, to lead men further off from their maker &s;till; and for this end I brought in gods and godde&s;&s;es, a numerous train; for in|&s;tance, if any man was more remarkable than others, for murdering his neighbours, or for giving large gifts to the church, i. e. the clergy, I got him deified as &s;oon as he died, and had wor&s;hip offered to him, in the &s;ame degree with faint-wor&s;hip in the church of Rome; for &s;aint wor&s;hip and hero-wor&s;hip differ only in name.</P>
<P>Indeed it is but doing ju&s;tice to &s;aints, in the Romi&s;h ca|lendar, to ob&s;erve, that the greate&s;t part of them obtained

Well, I went on and pro&s;pered, till I had brought all the world, a few individuals excepted, to wor&s;hip the works of the ma&s;on, carpenter, black&s;mith, or founder. Encourage but any trade, and it is &s;ure to pro|&s;per: the god-making trade being univer&s;ally encouraged, pro&s;pered exceedingly; for in a little time there were na|tional gods, much the &s;ame with the &s;even champious of Chri&s;tendom; provincial gods; county-gods; pari&s;h-gods; and even hou&s;ehold gods, to the great emolument of the clergy.

Oh, it was a &s;ore trial, gentlemen. Im|manuel, a very dear lover of men, having &s;at on the circle of heaven, for near four thou&s;and years, with much relent|ing of mind, and longings for human happine&s;s, from thence beheld the dreadful havock I made in the world, rendering the whole po&s;terity of Adam the children of wrath. Often did he call to the inhabitants of the earth, to take me up and burn me for a witch but they were too much my friends to regard his advice: and indeed had they regarded, it would have been an undertaking &s;uch as they could not execute without auxiliary &s;trength. He &s;at long, and long, he won|dered that there war no friend to help again&s;t &s;o potent an adver&s;ary; when at la&s;t he &s;aw, there was none to help, he
<PB N="140" REF="027249_0139_0FD3EC7811E6CF38">aro&s;e from his ja&s;per &s;eat and, in a tran&s;port of love, declar|ed, that his own arm &s;hould bring &s;alvation. According to the high determination, he di&s;mantled him&s;elf of the robes of manife&s;t glory, laid a&s;ide his imperial diadem, which irra|diates all the cra&s;ts of light, po&s;ted down to this world, on the wings of compa&s;&s;ion re&s;olving to conquer by dying.</P>
<P>Alarmed at &s;uch an unprecedented enterprize, I di&s;patched our &s;wift winged coutier with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to hell, to inform my great father, and the infernal divan, of the a&s;ton|i&s;hing event. As &s;oon as Fame reported her &s;tory, the monarch &s;ummoned his poors to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him in the flaming council chamber, there to deliberate on the matter, and hav|ing majur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly weighed every circum&s;tance of it, it was re|&s;olved, to di&s;patch the devin Malevolus to Fa&s;tofus and me, with directions &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.

Falax, and me, &s;hould take up our re&s;i|dence at Jeru&s;alem, with the &s;cribes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and doctors of the law. We immediately obeyed our in&s;tructions, and &s;ucceeded admirably in our emba&s;&s;y. At the &s;ame time Cru|delis and Concupi&s;centia, were appointed pienipotentiaries to the tetrarchical court of Gallike, where they received infallible te&s;timonies of Herod's e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the time that Immanuel was to be revealed, He|rod admitted but cou&s;in Su&s;picio&s;us to frequent audiences, of which the devil Crudelis to his everla&s;ting honour, greatly availed him&s;elf.

<P>I do not know that uncle; but I am ready to tell you what hand I had in it. You all know the man, and a tru&s;ty friend of ours he was, as any in his day. You know he mo&s;t inordinately loved Herodias, his own brother Philip's wife, and by the direction of our friend Concupi&s;centia, he added ince&s;t to his adultery, by taking her to his bed. It was about this time, that this famous Bapti&s;t, the founder of the &s;ect called by his name, began his public mini&s;try, and, fearle&s;s of man, exclaimed again&s;t all manner of uncleanne&s;s, for he was faithful to his commi&s;&s;ion. Well, this &s;ame au|&s;tere Bapti&s;t took occa&s;ion one day in the following manner to reprove the tetrach for his lewdne&s;s; Herod, &s;aid he, the God who made thee, hath for his own glory exalted thee to the tetrachical dignity, but far from &s;tudying his ho|nour, thou acte&s;t mo&s;t unworthily, and turne&s;t his goodne&s;s to thee into wantonne&s;s. Do&s;t not thou know that the &s;ame God who made thee ruler in Gallilee, hath &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt not commit adultery," put her therefore away from thee; if thou do&s;t not, thou mu&s;t expect that the Mo&s;t High will mingle for thee the cup of his indignation."</P>
<P>I was then at the court of Gallilee, and did not fail to im|prove the Bapti&s;t's admonition to the mo&s;t fatal purpo&s;es; I transformed my&s;elf into the likene&s;s of a grave courtier, a form very familiar to me; went up to the king, and held my inverting mirror before his eyes, bidding him to take a full view of the matter thus: as my humble &s;ervant, he did as I directed, and immediately &s;aid, "I perceive this field-preacher, this &s;ame Bapti&s;t, is an enemy to the Roman go|vernment, and becau&s;e I am a friend to Cae&s;ar he hath taken
<PB N="142" REF="027249_0141_0FD3EC798226B860">this advantage again&s;t me; doubtle&s;s to prejudi&s;e the minds of the people, either to the dive&s;ting me of the tetrarchical power, or to the &s;ubver&s;ion of Cae&s;ar's government.</P>
<P>When I had brought him thus to mi&s;con&s;true the hone&s;t de&s;igns of the Bapti&s;t, I held my partial tele&s;cope to his eye, through which he looked with great attention, and as he looked, &s;aid, "What a pre&s;umptuous wretch is this, to take upon him to reprove me? Me, who am his lord and ma&s;|ter, and can &s;oon de&s;troy both him and his father's hou&s;e. Mu&s;t Herod be reproved by this de&s;picable fellow with the rough garment? Is it now &s;o low with Cae&s;ar's deputy, the tetrach of Galilee, that he mu&s;t mildly bear the in&s;o|lence of every &s;narling pea&s;ant. No, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with our dignity, to let &s;uch daring boldne&s;s pa&s;s with impunity. If a courtier, or nobleman, clothed in &s;oft raiment, had tak|en a little liberty with me it might have been borne. But for this field preacher. This bapti&s;t, hah!"</P>
<P>By this time the great Revenge, that famous devil who&s;e hi&s;tory is &s;o tragical, thought it time for him to appear at court, and as &s;oon as he judged it convenient, thus acco&s;t|ed the offended king. "My lord the king, if your high|ne&s;s &s;uffer &s;uch in&s;olence as this to go unpuni&s;hed, your no|bles will contemn you, every paltry prie&s;t will &s;ay, Yon|der goes the ince&s;tuous Herod; aye, the very publicans and Herodians will alledge, that you are unworthy the dig|nity you &s;u&s;tain, and all will cen&s;ure your pu&s;illanimity, in let|ting &s;uch during in&s;olence pa&s;s with impunity. Remember, my lord, that if wide-mouthed Fame &s;hould, as is very likely, report the matter in Cae&s;ar's ear, it is ten to one, but he will ca&s;hier you, either for your reputed ince&s;t, or your want of magnanimity. Sir, for your honor's &s;ake, ea&s;t John into pri&s;on." Herod was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, and John was committed to jail.</P>

Not at all doubting but Herodian her daughter would captivate the king, &s;o far as to bring about the much de&s;ired death of John Bapti&s;t, &s;he decked her in &s;uperb array, in&s;tructed her what to a&s;k, if he &s;hould be plea&s;ed with her, then led her into the hall, where Herod and his nobles were carou&s;|ing. There &s;he footed the hornpipe with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that the mi&s;taken eye of the tetrach took her for a divinity, and &s;wore that he would offer a great &s;acrifice to her, to the value of one half of his kingdom, if her highne&s;s would on|ly deign to inform him what fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rifices were mo&s;t acceptable to her. She replied. "Human &s;acrifices are my delight. Give me then the Bapti&s;t's bead in a charger."</P>
<P>Now there began a horrid &s;cuffle in the tetrarch's brea&s;t. If he fulfilled not his oath, he thought he lo&s;t his reputation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nobles who &s;at at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with him; and if he did behead John Bapti&s;t, according to his oath, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of the people.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this &s;cufile, in came Revenge, and thus addre&s;&s;ed the king. "I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, John de&s;erves a thou&s;and deaths, for his in&s;olence to your highne&s;s." "Be|files, &s;aid Fa&s;to&s;us, who was then at court, the great tet|rarch

<P>The cumber&s;ome Bapti&s;t, thus di&s;patched, we united all our forces again&s;t Immanuel him&s;elf, who was, by the Jews, called Je&s;us of Nazareth. Many were the confer|ences which we had with the Jewi&s;h rabbins, doctors, prie&s;ts, &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, in which all our debates turned upon that object of our common hatred.

<P>I well remember the&s;e things, and the learned oration, which at that time, I made in the Sauhedrim,
<PB N="145" REF="027249_0144_0FD3EC7E043ACF38">and now we are a&s;&s;ociated in &s;uch a friendly manner, I have a good mind to repeat it to you. You have it in the follow|ing manner. "Hearken to me ye righteous teachers of the law; the virtuous governors of the Lord's inheritance, and I will unfold to you a ju&s;t &s;tate of the matter. You all know that the expected Meniah, &s;hall de&s;cend from a virgin prince&s;s of the lineage of David; but is this the &s;on of a prince&s;s? Is his mother a virgin, being the wife of a carpenter?" Here you'll ob&s;erve how I led them off from the truth, by attend|ing to appearances rather than reality; for Mary the mo|ther of Je&s;us, was actually a prince&s;s of the line of David, though ob&s;cure, and actually a virgin when he was con|ceived, though after that the wife of a carpenter. Every circum&s;tance attending his birth, corre&s;ponded exactly with ancient predictions recorded in the Bible; tho' by the way, it was by no means &s;uited to the expectation of the Jews. But to my very great mortification I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that, although the great men of the earth rejected him, the Angels of heaven de&s;cended to hymn their new born Lord. The con&s;tellations of the firmament, &s;hewed forth the birth of the Me&s;&s;iah. Ea&s;tern &s;ages heard the proclama|tion of the &s;tars, and came to the city of Bethlehem, to offer oblations to the incarnate &s;ource of life.</P>
<P>So very clear indeed are the Old Te&s;tament prophecies, concerning this affair, that the generality of the Jews were, at that time in full expectation of the coming of Me&s;&s;i|ah; therefore it required great addre&s;s &s;ufficiently to blind their eyes that they &s;hould not &s;ee, and know him when he came, to which purpo&s;e my &s;peech was wonderfully adapt|ed. "You know, and all the holy rabbins know, conti|nued I, that Me&s;&s;iah &s;hall come in power and great glory; &s;hall break the iron yoke of Roman &s;ervitude from off your necks, and exalt the throne of David, his illu&s;trious ance&s;|tor, high above the thrones of the kings of the earth, giv|ing to his happy &s;ubjects dominion and great glory, &s;ubject|ing
<PB N="146" REF="027249_0145_0FD3EC8203C170E8">to your government all tho&s;e who wi&s;h your de&s;truction. Worthy a&s;&s;embly, &s;aid I, you have cho&s;en the great Fa&s;to|&s;us, as your pre&s;ident and director; hearken therefore to me, and I will &s;hew you my opinion, concerning your ex|pected Me&s;&s;iah, and his appearance among you. It is mo&s;t probable, that when he comes, he will be born of illu&s;tri|ous parents, in the family of David; and when grown ma|ture in years, you may expect to &s;ee meet in him, a com|bination of all great and good qualities. By his wi&s;dom and prowe&s;s, he will rekindle the martial &s;pirit of the Jewi&s;h warriors, leading the armies of I&s;rael to glory and conque&s;t, and his throne &s;hall be exalted above all the kingdoms of the earth. You may therefore expect that when Me&s;&s;iah &s;hall come to your deliverance, you &s;hall &s;ee an illu&s;trious prince, attended by a warlike retinue, breathing vengeance again&s;t your enemies. But can this be him? Could the Me&s;&s;iah, think you, find no body but poor &s;hepherds, to be the pub|li&s;hers of his birth? More likely, if Je&s;us had indeed been the Me&s;&s;iah, he would have made choice of your reverences for his heralds. Can it ever be &s;uppo&s;ed my venerable rab|bins, that an ob&s;cure per&s;on, attended by a few de&s;picable fi&s;hermen, can have any legal preten&s;ions to the vacant throne of illu&s;trious David? Or can it ever be thought that the &s;on of a Galilean carpenter, attended by a few of the riff-raff of the people, is likely to re&s;tore the kingdom to I&s;rael?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, continued I, let him be what he may, it would bring di&s;honor on the princes of I&s;rael, &s;hould they &s;ubmit to be governed by the &s;on of a mechanie.</P>
<P>Who knows but the coming of Me&s;&s;iah may be yet more glorious, and ye &s;hall &s;ee the heavens open over your heads, he &s;hall appear in the firmament guarded on right and left, by innumerable battalions of armed &s;eraphs, with whom he may de&s;cend and &s;tand upon the mount of Olives, before he &s;hall make his triumphant entry into the holy metropolis of Jewry. Then &s;hall he di&s;patch his flaming &s;oldiers,
<PB N="147" REF="027249_0146_0FD3EC8417B04520">with full commi&s;&s;ion to kill, de&s;troy, and cau&s;e to peri&s;h all &s;uch &s;tubborn Gentiles, who refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the Jew|i&s;h empire, now become univer&s;al. Your enemies all de|&s;troyed, great &s;hall be your felicity and glory, for he &s;hall reign among you in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and glorious pro&s;|perity, unto all generations.</P>
<P>To whom, my worthy rabbins, will he come, but to &s;uch a generation of righteous men as your&s;elves. Ye your|&s;elves are witne&s;&s;es of your own righteou&s;ne&s;s and devo|tion. None &s;ay longer prayers, none give alms more pub|licly than you do. So great is your zeal for religion, that ye rob widows hou&s;es for the good of the church. So pi|ous your example, that my life for it, it will be imitated by the clergy in after ages. Your wicked ance&s;tors fell very far &s;hort of your piety, for they killed the prophets, and &s;toned them who were &s;ent unto them; but your re|verences, &s;o far abominate their murderous deeds, that you build and beautify their &s;epulchr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

<P>At the &s;ame time our infernal nobility were &s;truck with amazement, at the &s;eeming power which man had gained over Immanuel; and great Belzebub, in the mid&s;t of his a&s;toni&s;hment, thus addre&s;t his &s;enators, "Once was the memorable time, that we made &s;uch an attempt, to &s;ubvert the government of God, by re&s;i&s;ting the power of immanu|el; but great was our defeat, and di&s;mal our overthrow.

<P>I cannot deem it po&s;&s;ible that the God of heaven and earth would patiently &s;ubmit to &s;uch indignities, had he not &s;ome ends to an&s;wer by it, to which we at pre&s;ent are &s;tran|gers.

<P>Great Belzebub fini&s;hing here, and his motion being univer&s;ally approved of, all the legions of reprobate angels, a few excepted who were left to look after the affairs of the damned, took wing for earth to a&s;&s;i&s;t at &s;o very amazing an execution.

<P>A pertinent que&s;tion indeed, con&s;idering by whom it is made, my &s;on. But I a&s;&s;ure you, we were never &s;o greatly mi&s;taken in our days as at that time. For when we thought our&s;elves &s;ure of the victory, to our &s;ad experience we learned, that Immanuel was &s;tronge&s;t in death. For even when he was a dying, he laid us all under the mo&s;t perfect arre&s;t; none of us could take one &s;tep, either back|ward or forward, but as he gave permi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that being &s;poiled of all our power, we could not help our&s;elves, much le&s;s the afflicted prince.

<P>This done, once more we thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he day our own; but here, I cannot omit that fearful &s;tagmation of nature which happened then, and the &s;et of new preachers which were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oduced. For when all under our influences, had for|&s;aken Immanuel, who was betrayed by one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ied by ano|ther, and for&s;aken by all his preachers; the indignant &s;un

An invi&s;ible hand rent the vail of the temple, that cloth of extraordinary texture, in twain from the top to the bottom, and a voice was heard to &s;ay, "The glory is departed from I&s;rael, and now the mo&s;t holy place is laid open."</P>
<P>Death having conveyed Immanuel to its lonely man&s;ions, the re&s;olute, though maimed Belz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bub, our great prince, re|covered him&s;elf is much as was po&s;&s;ible, his head being in|curably broken; mu&s;tered his maimed forces, and went to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Death, if po&s;&s;ible, to keep Immanuel fa&s;t pri&s;oner in the &s;ilent tomb. Nothing doubting, but if this could be, we &s;hould render all that he had heretofore don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;uffered, null and void. The better to &s;ucceed in this important enterprize, we &s;ealed the door of the &s;epulchre and &s;et a watch of faithful &s;oldiers, in&s;tructed by the chief of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; and &s;till to make the &s;ecurity &s;trong|er, every fiend did his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tmo&s;t to impo&s;e weights on the buried body of Immanuel, to prevent his re&s;urrection from the &s;olitary grave.</P>
<P>But to our eternal confu&s;ion, on the third day of his invi|&s;ible &s;tate, he aro&s;e &s;hook him&s;elf from the du&s;t, came to the door of the &s;epulchre, bur&s;t it open, and laid hold on Death, who &s;tood as continel next to the door of the tomb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rampled him under his feet, and by main force wrenched from him his poi&s;onous &s;ting, that &s;ad repo&s;itary of all his &s;trength. This done, he &s;aid, "Henceforth, mon&s;ter, na&s;t thou no power over the people for whom I have died." Then he broke impetuou&s;ly through all the lines of martial inferuals, who &s;tood in firm phalanx around the tomb;

<P>Ah, gentlemen, great was the cau&s;e of my di&s;|may, for Immanuel gave &s;uch demon&s;tration of his Me&s;&s;iah|&s;hip, that all which was written in the prophets concerning
<PB N="156" REF="027249_0155_0FD3EC8EDF7A70F0">him, was exactly fulfilled in his life and death: yea, &s;o ve|ry &s;triking was the evidence, that many cried, <Q>Truly this is a ju&s;t man,</Q> and others, <Q>Truly this is the Son of God.</Q> Therefore I greatly feared that all the world would become believers in him, and con&s;equently &s;hake off my yoke. But I was much obliged to my good friends the Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;h clergymen; for their reverences greatly befriended me, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmly e&s;pou&s;ed my intere&s;t; exerted their ut|mo&s;t power to e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of great Infidelis, and to de&s;troy the early &s;eeds of Chri&s;tianity &s;own by Immanuel, and now beginning to grow.</P>
<P>Immanuel having in oppo&s;ition to all the powers of darkne&s;s, fini&s;hed the work for which he came down to the earth; he triumphantly a&s;cended to his native heaven, to the primeval embraces of his eternal Father, and a&s;&s;umed all the en&s;igns of empyrean glory.</P>
<P>Soon after this the high fe&s;tival of Penteco&s;t drew on, and as I formerly attended at Jeru&s;alem, in the mid&s;t of ma|ny thou&s;ands, who, according to the law, came up to wor|&s;hip upon that occa&s;ion, not only from Indea, but from na|tions very remote. I dreaded no harm at the hands of a few ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terate fi&s;hermen, having not been informed that any of the rulers, or of the &s;cribes and phari&s;eas, had believed in Je&s;us, and therefure was at no pains to prevent the multi|tude coming up to the &s;olemnity as u&s;ual. But here was another &s;hock my kingdom &s;u&s;tained; for Peter the fi&s;her|man, who, &s;o very lately like a da&s;tard, impiou&s;ly deni|ed his Lord with profane oaths, now filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;tood up in the mid&s;t and clearly proved that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;us was the very Me&s;&s;iah, and upon this occa&s;ion played off the heavy artillery of Sinia on the con&s;ciences of my people, which was attended with &s;ucce&s;s &s;o fatal to me, that no le&s;s than three thou&s;and were pierced through the heart at once, and fell on the field of action. Now it was that my evil apprehen&s;ions were again alarmed, plainly perceiving that the artillery of the word was levelled again&s;t my per&s;on,
<PB N="157" REF="027249_0156_0FD3EC90D040FAF0">and that the fir&s;t end of the go&s;pel was the &s;ubver&s;ion of my diabolical government. However, I drew up all the forces which I po&s;&s;ibly could, in the hurry of that &s;urprize, and had ju&s;t time to give one general di&s;charge, my &s;oldiers cry|ing out as they gave the volley, "The&s;e men are drunken with new wine." It was but a poor oppo&s;ition to doctrine &s;o powerful, I allow, but it was the be&s;t that could at that time be made, for we were obliged to retreat in much con|fu&s;ion, and leave the Chri&s;tian fi&s;hermen ma&s;ters of the field.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were a little recovered from the di&s;order into which that unexpected misfortune had plunged us, I &s;ummoned a council of war, in which the &s;elf-righteous Jews were the principal, next to our infernal train. I my&s;elf gave &s;pecial orders, that &s;ome method &s;hould be concerted effec|tually to de&s;troy the name of Je&s;us; for, &s;aid I, "If we let them alone all the people will believe in their doctrine." In this council it was re&s;olved, to rai&s;e an army of tho&s;e who were the greate&s;t adver&s;aries to the name of Je&s;us, to whom orders &s;hould be given to kill, de&s;troy, and cau&s;e to peri&s;h all who believed in this way, till the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hould be bani&s;hed from the face of the earth. This army was rai&s;ed, and the command given to Saul of Tar&s;us, at that time a mighty zealot for us, and who, for a &s;ea&s;on, made dreadful havoc of all that believed contrary to the faith of the prie&s;ts; for it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the opinion of the prie&s;ts, has been e&s;teemed true orthodoxy, and the only faith, in all ages or countries.</P>
<P>But here another &s;ad di&s;appointment and lo&s;s be&s;el me, for as this &s;ame captain Saul was on his march to Dama&s;|cus, to fight a pitched battle with the Chri&s;tians, it &s;o fell out that Immanuel him&s;elf was taking a tour in the valley, to &s;ee how the pomegranates budded, and falling in with tru&s;ty Saul on his journey, unveiled his own per&s;onal excellencies to aim, and laid him under an immediate arre&s;t. As &s;oon as
<PB N="158" REF="027249_0157_0FD3EC9282FCCD10">he &s;aw the beauties of Immanuel, he felt the mo&s;t &s;incere e&s;|teem for his per&s;on, and conceived the mo&s;t exalted &s;enti|ments of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> friend&s;hip and love.

<P>Immanuel having the mo&s;t tender regard for Saul, gave him a new name, written upon a white &s;tone, appointed him one of his prime mini&s;ters, and &s;ent him on an emba&s;&s;y to my &s;ubjects, to negociate a revolt from me.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive the a&s;toni&s;hment the Jewi&s;h clergy were in, when &s;wift-winged Fame arrived and blowed it abroad in every &s;treet, that Saul, who was formerly &s;o zealous for our intere&s;t, was now become a ring-leader of the &s;ect of the Nazarenes, and was likely to do us more mi&s;chief than all who had gone before him.</P>
<P>By this time &s;everal of the Jewi&s;h rabbins, rebelled a|gain&s;t me, and joined them&s;elves to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, who now made it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to go from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> place, exhorting my &s;ubjects to revolt, expo&s;ing my deformity and devili&s;hne&s;s, to all they met with.

<P>Trying times indeed. For, notwith&s;tanding the fervent zeal of Malevolus and Crudelis, the many fore cam|paigns they had &s;erved &s;o enervated their arms, that, al|though their principles remained implacable, they were even obliged to &s;it down in de&s;pair of ever being able to ex|tirpate the religion of Je&s;us from the world.</P>
<P>But my fertile brain &s;oon produced fre&s;h devices; &s;eeing many of my temples for&s;aken, and my idols without mercy thrown to the pavement, I began to think of other expedi|ents to impede the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity.

<P>A very important que&s;tion, much canva&s;&s;ed, but never as yet re&s;olved. Had I been a clergyman in&s;tead of a devil, I had certainly been a great ca&s;ui&s;t in this part of &s;chool theology. Never was a point of doctrine more be|laboured certainly than this, and never were people more divided in &s;entiments than about its re&s;olution, even from the great church of Turkey down to the &s;malle&s;t di&s;&s;enting congregation. The divines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in Turkey &s;tands &s;tifly to it, that Mahomed and them&s;elves ought to pre&s;ide over all the believing world. The doctors of France, Spain, and Italy, are as firmly per&s;uaded that pre-eminence is due to none but his holine&s;s and them&s;elves; and that all who are not of the &s;ame opinion, are certainly in a &s;tate of damnation.</P>
<P>As for their reverences in England, though they will de|ny no honour to his pope&s;hip, which really is his due, they will &s;ubmit to none as the leading prie&s;t but his Grace of Canterbury, and con&s;ider that church which they are the pillars of, as the pure&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment that the lower world can boa&s;t of.

<P>Tho&s;e female fiends, the ladies Pro&s;perity and Ea&s;e, as plenipotentiaries for Belzebub, made great propo|&s;als to them, and indeed they &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed kingdoms, principalities and powers, of the Chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>Then were the Chri&s;tians able to maintain them&s;elves again&s;t their Pagan neighbours, my profe&s;t &s;ubjects. This I patiently bore, believing that the martial &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tians, a little indulged for the pre&s;ent, would greatly make for our intere&s;t and the final e&s;tabli&s;hment of my kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="027249_0161_0FD3EC27C320C800">
Tho&s;e revered-ladies, Pro&s;perity and Ea&s;e, had not been long among&s;t them, ere many who bore the Chri&s;tian name were de&s;irous of coming to terms of agreement with me; but upon this expre&s;s condition, "That in the treaty of amity betwixt them and me, it &s;hould be &s;tipulated, that they &s;till be called by the name of Chri&s;t, for it was now become &s;candalous to bear the name of another." This reque&s;t I thought rea&s;onable enough, and that to grant it would be no very great conce&s;&s;ion on my part, therefore I readily agreed, and the treaty was confirmed. It is an invariable rule with me, that it is not very material whether a man is called a Chri&s;tian or not, provided I have but &s;afe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart: for names do not change the nature of things.</P>
<P>This amiable fiend, lady Pro&s;perity, re&s;ted not in her plea&s;ing operations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till &s;he had quite reduced the oriental nations to &s;uch a degree of rea&s;on, that they petitioned my per&s;onal return among them, and as my loving &s;ubjects re|turned to their allegiance. Having now &s;ecured the orient|al, the &s;plendid lady and me, undertook the conque&s;t of the occidental church; and, the better to &s;ucceed in our en|terpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, we fixed our abode at Rome, famous both for an|cient and modern pagani&s;m. As for me, I knew it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould remain incognito, till a fair opportunity &s;hould offer for my emerging out of darkne&s;s: but my lady Pro&s;perity decked her&s;elf in her riche&s;t attire, and openly re&s;ided among the Chri&s;tians, who were &s;o ravi&s;hed with her excellent beauties, that he was deemed the mo&s;t happy man who could prevail with her excellency to take up her lodging in his hou&s;e. Her lady&s;hip, you know, is not to be won by every one who addre&s;&s;es her; here &s;he acted ac|cording to previous in&s;tructions, and made free with the bi&s;hop's hou&s;e, as be&s;t &s;uited to our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Wonderful were the works which &s;he performed there: for at her fir&s;t arrival the bi&s;hop was no more than a plain hone&s;t man, having but one congregation in his dioce&s;e; but fir&s;t the created him, Reverend; then, His Lord&s;hip; then,

Indeed the va&s;t dominion and immen&s;e revenues which &s;he conferred on him, &s;o &s;welled the haughty prelate, that, not contented with the honours then po&s;&s;e&s;t, he claimed dominion over all, as the father of the whole world, Even this was &s;hort of giv|ing content, unle&s;s he &s;hould al&s;o reign over heaven and hell; therefore he hath &s;eized the gates of both, and lets in and out ju&s;t whom he plea&s;es.

The devil him&s;elf never aimed at higher things. In the mean while her lady&s;hip, at her lei&s;ure hours, waited on tho&s;e who were of any account among the Chri&s;tians, who for the mo&s;t part had nothing of Chri&s;tianity but the name. Some indeed were firmly attached to Immanuel, who could not be bribed even by her large&s;t offers; but their number was com|paratively &s;mall. Seeing the progre&s;s which Pro&s;perity made, they went about the &s;treets complaining in &s;ome &s;uch words as the&s;e: "This harlot Pro&s;perity will be the ruin of Chri&s;tianity."</P>

<P>Having maturely dige&s;ted his plan, I replied.

<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon I was conjured up by Squire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roadfield, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the whipping of a poor man, who be|ing ready to peri&s;h with hunger, unluckily begged a mor&s;el of bread at his door. But before I give you an account of the whipping, I &s;hall fir&s;t give your a &s;pecimen of the gen|tleman's character.</P>
<P>Squire Broadfield is a gentleman and ju&s;tice of peace. He is worth five thou&s;and a year, and that is enough to make him a gentleman, even if his father had been a beggar; to make him wi&s;e, though born a fool; learned, although a very dunce. Indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, the principal part of his wor&s;hip's education was had under Dr. Ringwood and Dr. Jowler, the celebrated tutors of his kennel. Their maxims he perfectly under&s;tands, and their virtues he has dopted; but five thou&s;and a year you know, makes the &s;tudy of the kennel truly cla&s;&s;ical.</P>
<P>Talk you of Orpheus to him, his wor&s;hip propo&s;es the vir|tue of Ringwood to your con&s;ideration. Do you admire the
<PB N="170" REF="027249_0168_0FD3CDA8EEFF6710">ardour which flames in the Iliads; his wor&s;hip &s;ays, no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ic like the voice of Jowler. Tell him of the maje&s;ty of Virgil, he'll bid you mind well the gait of his hor&s;e, what a maje&s;tic creature he is. An emperor, &s;ays he, might be proud to ride &s;uch another. Do you recommend the plea|&s;ures of &s;olid learning to him, he is in raptures about the diver|&s;ions of the chace. As yet he hath avoided the yoke of ma|trimony; not that ever he was an admirer of continence, few gentlemen being more conver&s;ant with the fair &s;ex than his wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>He keeps in his hou&s;e a wanton train of overfed &s;ervants, the &s;uperfluities of who&s;e table would comfort the bowels of many indigent: be&s;ides a pack of hounds, which devour more than &s;erves to maintain all the poor in the pari&s;h work|hou&s;e. But this mi&s;erable wretch who cannot work becau&s;e he is lame, and having no pari&s;h to flee to for relief, choo&s;eth to beg rather than &s;teal, for which his wor&s;hip ordered him to be &s;everely whipt by my good &s;on the beedle, till be &s;hall be made willing either to &s;teal for a living or to die of hunger.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not certain that John Ketch, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of fatal character, had any hand in procuring the law for whipping beggars; but certainly it adds greatly to his revenue. Nor am I certain that it was made on purpo&s;e to drive vagrants from begging to &s;tealing, in order more &s;peedily to ea&s;e the nation of &s;uch a burden; but certain I am, it greatly helps to fill up the Tyburn chronicle. But what more, cou&s;in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the poor lame fellow was confronted by the beedle, and was convinced of the reality of his wor&s;hip's be|nevolent intention to have him well flogged; he fell on his knees, and implored mercy for God's &s;ake, and for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, &amp;c. promi&s;ing that, if he might be forgiven this once, he would never return to the&s;e parts any more. He plead|ed his indigence, his hungry belly, his lamene&s;s, his belong|ing to no pari&s;h, and every thing his fear could devi&s;e; but all &s;erved only to harden the ju&s;tice's heart the more. He ordered the beedle to take him away, and do his duty imme|diately.
<PB N="171" REF="027249_0169_0FD3EC384E709C08">The beedle &s;ignified to him as they drew near to the whipping-po&s;t, that he felt &s;ome relentings of heart to|wards him; and that if he could only give him an hand&s;ome fee, he would favour him as much as his reputation would ad|mit of. But, upon enquiry, finding that the old fellow was &s;o wicked as to have no money, his heart became like bra&s;s, and he re&s;olved to ply him throughly to the &s;atisfaction of his wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Accordingly when 'Squire Broadfield and me arrived in company to &s;ee the &s;port, there was the poor ra&s;eal, who&s;e poverty was his principal crime, tied to the po&s;t, and mangled with the cord, which the lu&s;ty beedle plied with nervous arm.</P>
<P>Oh! how his wor&s;hip and me did laugh, to &s;ee the vil|lain, who&s;e poverty was ob&s;tinate, leaping, as his lamene&s;s would let him, and wrything his bloody back, as the whip was lu&s;tily pryed about him by the &s;turdy beedle; who, for his part, would rob, and &s;teal, and do any thing, rather than be whipped by a tru&s;ty brother of the trade; yea, would act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en thou&s;and villainies rather than die of hunger. This fellow mu&s;t be a mo&s;t incorrigible rogue to be &s;ure, if he is not willing by this time either to &s;teal and be hanged, or patiently to die of an empty belly.</P>

<P>What, Crudelis, have they made a law to whip all the beggars that infe&s;t your country?</P>

<SPEAKER>CRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Impiator. I heartily wi&s;h there were &s;uch a law, for then I would even quit my devil&s;hip to be|come king of the beedles. If all beggars were to be puni&s;h|ed at the whipping-po&s;t, (as I know no rea&s;on why they &s;hould not) perhaps his wor&s;hip him&s;elf, and his reverence the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, would not e&s;cape a thorough drub|bing. And yet, Crudelis, as my name is, I think the whip-beggar-law is very partial and unju&s;t, as it lays hold on none but poor petty beggars, who would be content with bread, &s;hins of beef, and table beer; whil&s;t others may with impunity beg, and obtain &s;ome thou&s;ands a year of the nation's money.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="027249_0170_0FD3ECA0848E0BD0">
What are all the ranks of mankind, but &s;o many beg|gars? Does not his reverence, the inferior clergyman, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g a living from my lord bi&s;hop, or &s;ome neighbouring no|bleman? And do not their lord&s;hips beg of the king? Do not the very members of parliament come hat in hand, and meanly beg of the corporation, having no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worth in them&s;elves? Do not the pliant courtiers &s;ue to the favorite for places of tru&s;t for the &s;ake of the profit? Beggars all, be&s;ides the &s;tern patriot, a pelican which does not appear once in a century. But if their lord&s;hips, the noble beggars, and their honours, the gentlemen beggars, are to be con&s;idered as authors of the whipping-law, I &s;hould have wondered indeed, if care had not been taken to exempt them&s;elves from its penalty.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e &s;tands exactly thus. If a gentleman, extrava|gant beyond his revenue, begs for a thou&s;and or two per annum, he &s;hall not only e&s;cape with impanity, but obtain his &s;uit, provided always, he will be the humble pliant crea|ture of the mini&s;ter; but if a poor helple&s;s, low-born wretch, pinched with hunger, happen to beg a piece of bread in an interdicted place, he &s;hall be exerci&s;ed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the whipping-po&s;t.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding I prevailed with the Jews, almo&s;t una|nimou&s;ly to contemn the per&s;on and te&s;timony of Je&s;us of Nazareth, the Chri&s;tian religion gained ground in the world. Yea, the word of God grew mightily, and prevailed over

The famous lady Pro&s;perity and you, bro|ther, had not been a very great while at Rome, before I found &s;ufficient encouragement to erect my office for vending &s;acerdotal titles there; and I mu&s;t own that for many years I had a bri&s;k run of trade, till in fact the church had room for no more, from the great infallible prie&s;t at Rome, down to a Cumberland curate. The fir&s;t introduction of this kind was a very brilliant medal, in&s;cribed with the&s;e five capital letters; P. A. T. E. R. which having fini&s;hed, I pre&s;ent|ed at a general convocation of bi&s;hops, who as yet were not become reverend. They were highly plea&s;ed with the de|vice, having never &s;een &s;uch a thing before. The worthies examined it one after another, and all found that the ven|erable letters, well put together, and properly interpreted,
<PB N="174" REF="027249_0172_0FD3ECA2301C21B0">&s;ignified Father. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rtainly the event has proved, that great is the magical power of this medal.</P>
<P>Every one &s;aid to his fellow: <Q>What can be more agree|able to our function than this venerable title? Are not we the fathers of the people?</Q> They forgot that One is he Father of the people, even God. I was therefore de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, with all &s;peed, to procure a like medal for every member of this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly. Soon after this, I provided medals more highly fini&s;hed, and in&s;cribed; P, A, T, R, I, A, R, C, H, A, one of which I be&s;towed on the holy bi&s;hop of Rome; a &s;econd I gave to the bi&s;hop of Alexandria; a third to that of Con&s;tantinople; a fourth to that of Jeru&s;a|lem, and a fifth to him who pre&s;ided in the church of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tioch. In all which places my medals were more highly valued than the fine&s;t ruby; and he who could by any means obtain one of them, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">levated f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r above the common rank of mortals.</P>
<P>Long and very &s;ucce&s;sfully had I followed this medalian trade, when a famous and worthy pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Rome, who was a great admirer of my productions, came into my of|fice; after doing obei&s;ance to me, and turning over my pretty devices, he a&s;ked me, "If I thought, with all my ingenuity, I could produce a genuine medal with this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;cription, P, A, P, A, S,: S, U, P, R, E, M, U, S.</P>
<P>OR,</P>
<P>EPISCOPUS UNIVERSALIS." I told him, that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the arti&s;ts in hell were to unite their wi&s;dom in one mechanical head, it would be utterly impo&s;&s;ible; for, &s;aid I, the whole creation doth not furni&s;h &s;ufficient materials.

My good friend, plea&s;e you to make me the medal, and I will cau&s;e the world believe that I had it from the Almighty, with letters patent under the broad &s;eal of heaven, for the &s;ole u&s;e of it to me and my &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever. "I well know, returned I, that your holine&s;s means no more, than in a pious manner to impo&s;e the cheat upon the world, the better to fill your coffers, and aggrandize your name; in which laudible undertaking, your adored Fa&s;to&s;us &s;hall be ever ready to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>To work I went, having called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal of our friends, and made a counterfeit medal, in the like|ne&s;s of a treble crown, with certain in&s;criptions of the cab|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;tic kind upon it. They were &s;hort but pithy &s;entences, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s you &s;hall hear. On the one &s;ide of the fir&s;t crown was in&s;cribed,</P>
<P>He that is honoured as the weater of this medal, is po&s;|&s;e&s;t of infallible knowledge.&mdash;Oppo&s;ite to that was carv|ed, in fine Italian, He is &s;upreme over all laws, divine and human.&mdash;On the right &s;ide of the &s;econd crown, were the&s;e words in large capitals, This is the head of the church. &mdash;On the left were the&s;e, This is the viear of Chri&s;t, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Peter.&mdash;On the third and uppermo&s;t crown were the following. The keys of heaven, hell, and purgatory, are in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and u&s;ed only at his plea|&s;ure. Round the edge, was this writing. He reigneth &s;u|preme over all the kings of the earth, put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth down one, and exalteth another at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When fini&s;hed, I pre&s;ented it to the arch-prelate, who received it with all imaginable thankfulne&s;s, viewed it with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight, and oftener than once, prote&s;ted by his infallibility that he had never &s;een any thing contrived with equal art, nor &s;o &s;uitably adapted to his a&s;piring principles. Tran&s;ported with joy, he cried out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thou ingenious &s;pirit? blo&s;s thee for thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance?

As for laymen, the &s;cum of nature, I regard not them. They are a&s;&s;es, upon whom we &s;hall ride with plea&s;ure and profit; and if at any time they ride re&s;tif, we will tame them with the rod of di&s;ci|pline, and &s;o belabour them with the cudgel of excommu|nication, that with gladne&s;s they &s;hall &s;ubmit implicitly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our deci&s;ions. Could not the great Fa&s;to&s;us &s;trike me a variety of medals, of different worth and de&s;igns; and lodge them &s;afely in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that I may have the &s;ole di&s;tribution of them among&s;t my depending clergy; for unle&s;s they cleave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s clo&s;e to me, as the &s;cales to the back of Leviathan, I &s;hall never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> able to &s;upport my preten&s;ions to infallibi|lity and &s;upremacy.</P>
<P>To which I replied, "Great prie&s;t, in order to bind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lergy inviolably to your intere&s;t, let me advi&s;e you to take care that your deci&s;ions be always in their favor; place your own grandeur in the front of all your proceedings, and let theirs immediately follow it;" which advice the good man cordially embraced, and ever &s;ince has invaria|bly followed it with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion,</P>
<P>From henceforth, continued I, I give you full power and authority to pre&s;ide over all tho&s;e medals which I have already i&s;&s;ued forth; and for the future the di&s;po&s;al of them &s;hall be at your holine&s;s's plea&s;ure.

<PB N="177" REF="027249_0175_0FD3ECA68E7F2A98">me alone you can lord it over the e&s;tates and con&s;ciences of men. The great prelate heard with attention, and then rejoined, "Mighty Fa&s;to&s;us, if you will oblige me in this, you may depend upon me and all my &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as faithful &s;ubjects; implicitly obedient &s;ervants to your highne&s;s, and your father Belzebub.

<P>Then &s;ir, by what you &s;ay, it may be conclud|ed, the hoary prelate at Rome is very &s;en&s;ible that he is Belzebub's agent, and that all his preten&s;ions, beyond tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t pa&s;tor, are an impo&s;ition.</P>

<P>Yes, Avaro, he knows it very well, and that makes him more like unto us: indeed the cheat is &s;o palpable, that any one who has read his Bible with attention mu&s;t needs &s;ee through it. But by the&s;e proceedings, I &s;oon found I had cut out a great deal of work for my&s;elf, &s;o that I was o|bliged to be doubly diligent. However, my &s;ole delight be|ing to promote the works of darkne&s;s, I &s;oon &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck off &s;even|ty new medals, in&s;cribed CARDINALIS. The&s;e I pre&s;ented to his holine&s;s, who examined them with great attention, and was highly plea&s;ed with the inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious device.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t noble &s;pirit, &s;aid he to me, the&s;e medals I perceive, will rai&s;e the gentlemen who receive them next in dignity to my&s;elf, and they will be the fir&s;t and mo&s;t able to &s;upport the &s;ee of Rome." You mu&s;t needs know, my friends, that this prediction has been fully accompli&s;hed. For, in all ages, &s;ince the cardinals received their medals they have been tru|ly indefatigable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;hing the power and &s;upremacy of the pope.

The&s;e, &s;aid he, &s;hall fix the cla&s;s next to the former, and I doubt not but every one of them will be &s;ufficiently ob&s;equious in expectation of a cardinal's hat.

<P>Was it I, do you a&s;k? Yes, it was I indeed! Who ever read in the New Te&s;tament, any thing at all about a &s;upreme bi&s;hop, or about cardinals, and lord bi&s;hops?

<P>To my great honour I &s;peak it, Avaro, I cea&s;ed not when I had made their lord&s;hips the dioce&s;ians, but went on with my trade, till I had procured curious medals for a very great number of abbots, &s;warms of monks and friars; je&s;uits, franci&s;can and dominican friars, with a long train of etceteras, who &s;oon appeared in &s;hoals, as numerous as locu&s;ts when they a&s;cend out of the bottomle&s;s pit.

<P>After all this, the &s;ubtile prie&s;t thought that the antichri&s;tian hierarchy of Rome could not &s;tand upon a foundation &s;olid enough, unle&s;s all, or at lea&s;t &s;ome of the

Therefore I told his holine&s;s, that I had three highly fini&s;hed medals by me ready prepared, fitting for royal per&s;onages. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cribed, Rex Catholicus; let it be pre&s;ent|ed to your &s;ervant his maje&s;ty of Spain. This &s;econd medal, in&s;cribed, Rex Chri&s;tiani&s;&s;imus, will be an acceptable pre|&s;ent to your va&s;&s;al the French king; and this third in&s;crib|ed, Rex Fideli&s;&s;imus, I advi&s;e you to be&s;tow upon the little monarch of Portugal. His hoary holine&s;s with raptures replied, "Very good, mo&s;t noble Fa&s;to&s;us, this device will doubtle&s;s &s;ecure all the&s;e three princes, as &s;o many pillars to &s;upport my infallibility. But what of the king of En|gland, &s;ir? I dread tho&s;e i&s;landers. Is there no medalian charm, by which that invincible prince can be &s;ecured to our intere&s;t? I pray you good Fa&s;to&s;us lend me an hand in this.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to &s;erve your holine&s;s, replied I, and then he withdrew. Soon after I pre&s;ented him with a me|dal &s;uited to his wi&s;h. It bore this in&s;cription, De&s;en&s;or Fide, and was given to the monarch of England; but alas! I has not an&s;wered our expectations, for this &s;ame monarch in&s;tead of defending the orthodox faith of Rome, was the fir&s;t crowned head that prote&s;ted again&s;t the &s;upremacy of the Italian bi&s;hop.</P>

<P>It is &s;omewhat droll, that the king of England having &s;haken off the yoke of Rome, &s;hould &s;till keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the medal, which his predece&s;&s;ors received as a pre&s;ent from the pope.

<P>I beg leave to ob&s;erve that, according to modern maxims in my country, he is e&s;teemed a man of honour, who can imitate the popi&s;h prie&s;ts in &s;corning wedlock, and frequenting the company of lewd women. He who is a &s;tranger to every delicate and cha&s;te &s;entiment; who &s;corns religion, di&s;regards morality, and thinks it beneath his dig|nity to keep any of the commands of God; or even for a moment, to reflect that there is an hereafter.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman of true honour, fails not to improve his e&s;tate, be it great or &s;mall, to the be&s;t advantage; for he is neither indolent nor extravagant. His increa&s;ing re|venues are not heaped up for ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ation, nor laid by as u&s;e|le&s;s lumber, but applied to clothe the naked back, and re|fre&s;h the empty belly. His principal care is not how he may aggrandize his family, but how he may be&s;t &s;erve his king and country: for he lives not to him&s;elf, but to the public good. He adheres to &s;trict truth, is an utter &s;tran|ger to impertinent raillery, and perfectly dete&s;ts the voice
<PB N="181" REF="027249_0179_0FD3ECACBB671F70">of &s;lander. In his civil affairs, he does the &s;ame things to &s;uperiors, inferiors, and equals, which he would wi&s;h o|thers in like circum&s;tances to do for him&s;elf. If at any time he is &s;o unhappy as to give his neighbour ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, he is free and open in confe&s;&s;ing his error, and ready to retrieve it to the utmo&s;t of his power. The title of His Honour is well becoming &s;uch a man as this, whe|ther his e&s;tate is great or &s;mall, his birth illu&s;trious or ob|&s;cure. But mercenary &s;tate&s;men, plunderers of the public, ill de&s;erve the titles with which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed. Hap|py might it be for Britain, if &s;he could always procure of|ficers for every department in government, who would pre|fer the welfare of the nation to their own per&s;onal and do|me&s;tic emolument.

<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, Avaro; but bad as the world is, there is &s;till many to be found, who with pro|priety may be called men of honor: but it is well for us, they are mo&s;tly of ob&s;cure character. They cannot act the cringing knave, and vilely flatter their &s;uperiors, in order to gain preferment. Their countenances, adorned with comely mode&s;ty, cannot contend with the impudence of fools and rogues; therefore continue ob&s;cure, even when the mo&s;t worthle&s;s are exalted. But if a truly honorable man, &s;hould by &s;ome miracle a&s;cend to an eminent &s;tation, and be entru&s;ted with public concerns, his country is &s;ure to have a nur&s;ing-father, and not an accur&s;ed &s;tep-dame in him, as is often the ca&s;e with other governors.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, &s;ir, but it is the vulgar opinion that the reverence of the par&s;on does not depend upon his moral con|duct,

<P>I know it, Avaro, but it is a prevailing mi&s;take. Impo&s;ition of the hands, even of an apo&s;tle, could never make any man reverend, who&s;e doctrine is heterodox, or who&s;e conver&s;ation is immoral, otherwi&s;e our friend Simon of Samaria might have been numbered among their rever|ences. Indeed, Avaro, were any man hardy enough to attempt it. I know of no &s;ubject more proper for &s;atyr than the pretended reverence of the par&s;ons. But he mu&s;t be daring indeed, who would &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the ortho|dox prie&s;ts of the day, for that would be thought by many the very &s;ame as to oppo&s;e God Almighty him&s;elf, and eve|ry body would cry athei&s;t at him.</P>

For he is a reverend mini&s;ter, whether he is educated at Oxford or Aberdeen, who makes not gold, but the glory of Immanuel, and the welfare of immortal &s;ouls, the fir&s;t end of his labours.

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little, &s;ir; only that diligence, frugality and good hu&s;bandry, go on as u&s;ual. All heads plodding, and all hands active to get and to &s;ave; for getting and &s;av|ing is all the cry with them. I had a little matter to attend to la&s;t night, at the Swan-tavern, where there was a very re&s;pectable meeting of manufacturers, by whom &s;ome few things tending to promote emolument were con&s;idered. The fir&s;t con&s;ultation was, "How they might conveni|ently le&s;&s;en the quality of their goods, that their profits
<PB N="189" REF="027249_0187_0FD3CD8BAAC40368">might be &s;omewhat advanced:" in order to this a plan was propo&s;ed by Mr. Dolus, a very great trade&s;man, which was unammou&s;ly agreed to by the re&s;t. The &s;econd thing was to &s;ettle the prices, and come into mutual engagements, that no one &s;hould under-&s;ell his brethren, which after &s;ome &s;light altercation was as unanimou&s;ly &s;ettled. You mu&s;t know, mankind are not &s;atisfied with being oppre&s;&s;ed by infernal tyranny; but to add to the devil's work, are got into the happy way of joining in combination to oppre&s;s and devour one another. Nor is this practice peculiar to any one &s;et of men, but is common with dealers of every kind and denomination, from the opulent farmers to the dealers in coals and candles.</P>
<P>When this was done, a que&s;tion was put, How they &s;hould fini&s;h a certain quantity of goods again&s;t a certain day then propo&s;ed? For it &s;eems they have large orders at pre|&s;ent. To which one of them &s;aid, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to advance the journeymens wages in order to encourage their diligence. But this gentleman's motion was unani|mou&s;ly rejected; as an unprofitable way of proceeding, ve|ry ill &s;uited to the growing demands of their &s;everal fami|lies. It was then propo&s;ed, that a &s;mall premium &s;hould be given to every workman who &s;hould fini&s;h a certain quantity of goods in a limited time, then and there to be &s;tipulated. But this was al&s;o objected to, it being alledged, that &s;ome method might be found, that would produce the de&s;ired end, and yet &s;ave all tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary premiums; which if given would introduce a very bad cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>At la&s;t an old gentleman, who&s;e hoary locks &s;hone as &s;ilver from under his weather-beaten wig, aro&s;e, and mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed his brethren in the following manner: "Gentlemen, you all know that &s;uch is the indolent di&s;po|&s;ition of journeymen, that in general let their wages be ever &s;o good, they have no notion of obtaining more than will procure them a bare maintenance through the week, and a few quarts of &s;trong beer on Saturday night and Sunday.
<PB N="190" REF="027249_0188_0FD3ECBD182248A0">Therefore to advance their wages, is the certain way to have them work le&s;s than they do at pre&s;ent. But let us le&s;&s;en their wages in proportion to our extraordinary call for goods; for by how much more we drop the prices of workman&s;hip, by &s;o much the more work &s;hall we have done. A bare living they mu&s;t have, let the prices be ever &s;o low; and but a bare living they will have, if they are ever &s;o high. If we advance the price, they work le&s;s, and if we drop it, they will, they mu&s;t work more. I &s;ay then let us drop the prices."</P>
<P>The old gentleman's advice was cordially embraced by them all, and every one ble&s;&s;ed the &s;agacity of the old fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now grown grey in wi&s;dom. And this day, or to morrow, the journey mens wages are to be le&s;&s;ened accordingly.</P>

<P>I have often heard it remarked by our infernal &s;ages, that if the ambitious mind were to obtain what it is now in pur&s;uit of, true contentment would be as far di&s;tant as ever; and an Alexander, who covets a &s;econd world to ravage, could he get that, would want a third, after that a fourth, and &s;o on till he had plundered the many millions of worlds which God hath made. Even then, were &s;uch a thing po&s;&s;ible, his ambition would be as in&s;atiable as ever, and his la&s;t effort would be the &s;ame as that of father Belze|bub's; I mean, he would attempt to plunder the eternal

After all, I have ob&s;erved that the greater part of people are &s;o far from deeming ambition to be criminal, they think a &s;pice of it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to a man of honour.</P>

<P>Not at the court of London, Avaro, but Ver&s;ailles, therefore it would indicate better &s;en&s;e in your knowing people, to wi&s;h the French ladies the above misfortune.

This policy &s;eems indeed very my|&s;terious, when we con&s;ider that the Briti&s;h heroes can &s;o effectually drub the mon&s;ieurs, as to make them cry <HI>peccavi,</HI> and at the &s;ame time the French ladies &s;hould have the En|gli&s;h in &s;uch ab&s;olute &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, for any per&s;on to conceive the trouble I have, in preparing tho&s;e ladies for the ball or a&s;&s;embly, or pantheon, and what art I am obliged to employ, in hiding their &s;uppo&s;ed defects and redundancies. The lady who fancies her &s;tature to be &s;omewhat too low, obliges me to add to it the whole length of a &s;uper tall pair of wooden heels, and is extremely careful to &s;et off her little body to all advan|tage po&s;&s;ible, &s;o that every beholder mu&s;t be &s;truck with
<PB N="198" REF="027249_0196_0FD3EC1F9B4166D8">the mo&s;t perfect gentility of her appearance. On the other hand her neighbour, who is over-tall, is as careful on her part, to have the flatte&s;t heels that can be wore, and is e|qually indu&s;trious in decking to the be&s;t advantage the whole of her extravagant height.</P>
<P>Nor hath her neighbour, who is affected with a dun or yellow &s;kin, le&s;s trouble and anxiety of mind, be&s;ides her great toil of body. The wa&s;te &s;he makes of wa&s;h-balls, and the be&s;t recommended co&s;metics, together with her own and her &s;ervants labour, in endeavouring to rub off the na|tive tinct, is not to be conceived. But alas! it is labour in vain. All the comfort which remains for her, is derived from a black necklace, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two or three well di&s;po&s;ed patches, which &s;he hopes may in &s;ome mea&s;ure over-cloud the hated yellowne&s;s of the adjacent parts.</P>

But certainly it is deemed to be &s;o, and tho&s;e imperious dames, who have been favour|ed to their liking, do what they can to mortify tho&s;e who are le&s;s happy in their pede&s;tals.

In order to prevent the world having any &s;u&s;picion that &s;he is advanced in years, the co|quet procures a defence again&s;t the appearance of hoary hairs, and thus &s;he keeps her&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the belief that &s;he is growing old, till the dete&s;ted wrinkles on her forehead betray the fatal &s;ecret, and then &s;he de|clines fa&s;ter than other women, becau&s;e her grief gives &s;wiftne&s;s to her decay. Another lady is exceedingly griev|ed every time &s;he looks in her gla&s;s, becau&s;e, as &s;he thinks, her face is too much upon the fire to be deemed lovely; but &s;he comforts her&s;elf with the reflection that &s;he hath good features, and the great arti&s;t, when he fini&s;hed her has left a dimple in her chin.

<P>O yes, cou&s;in Impiator; all are apo&s;tolical, if their own te&s;timony is to be credited; all the Romi&s;h clergy are apo&s;tolical, and give it out that Peter the fi&s;herman was their great-graudfather. The church of Scotland is al&s;o apo&s;tolical, and the power of the twelve apo&s;tles is thought to have been transferred to the Scotch pre&s;bytery. The independants are apo&s;tolical al&s;o, on account of the &s;oundne&s;s of their doctrine and regularity of &s;ome part of their di&s;cipline. But both they and the north country clergymen labour under &s;ome di&s;advantages; for the latter have lo&s;t the deed of transfer, which conveyed the authority of the apo&s;tles unto the pre&s;by|tery, and the former are unhappy enough to be unable to pro|duce either precept or precedent from the apo&s;tles for infant &s;prinkling, which is notwith&s;tanding a foundation doctrine, and by them accounted Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m. The bapti&s;ts; or as the independants and methodi&s;ts re&s;pectfully call them a|nabapti&s;ts, you may be &s;ure are not le&s;s apo&s;tolical than their neighbours, having, be&s;ides all the advantages claimed by the independants, the enjoyment of bapti&s;m according to the primitive in&s;titution. So that no defect whatever, in point of a go&s;pel &s;pirit, can hinder them from being apo&s;tolical.</P>

<P>By your leave, cou&s;in; I have often been puzzled to find out how it is the prelates of the church of England came to be apo&s;tolical and I prote&s;t I cannot after all unrid|dle the my&s;tery.

<P>Certain it is the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops mu&s;t be of a more noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rder than the apo&s;tles.

Among&s;t my di&s;ciples, I have heard amazing accounts of the wi&s;dom of the quakers, and the u&s;e they are of, in teaching even novices wi&s;dom by their provident example. However, I have as much won|dered what the papi&s;ts, epi&s;copalians, and every other &s;ect of profe&s;&s;ors, di&s;cern &s;o amiable and lovely in black, as to induce them to make it a canonical colour; and almo&s;t, if not altogether, e&s;&s;ential to the mini&s;trations of the word. No doubt they have heard that Belzebub is &s;aid to be dre&s;t in raiment of the deepe&s;t black, and one would wonder they &s;hould de&s;ire their mini&s;ters to be cloathed in the &s;ame uni|forms, &s;eeing they profe&s;&s;edly have declared war again&s;t him and all his principalities.

Were you by, when the quaker is examined by the re&s;t of the prote&s;tants, you would almo&s;t &s;plit your &s;ides with laugh|ing at their partiality and unfair repre&s;entation. "Say they, the quakers religion lies all in their dre&s;s, &s;peech and money getting.

<P>By this you may &s;ee, that the quakers are abu&s;ed and be|lied in their turn, as well as they abu&s;e and belie others. The above reflections are ju&s;t enough when applied only to &s;ome, or to a great many of them, but will by no means hold as a general rule: &s;eeing you all know, there is now and then a quaker who breaks away from his &s;ubjection to the god of this world; and de&s;piting all that we and our &s;able clan can do to prevent it, gets &s;afe within the palace of Im|manuel. Moreover there are at tho&s;e public meetings &s;ome, though comparatively few, who have a truly religious de|&s;ign in giving their attendance.

<P>By the in&s;trumentality of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, I got the preachers of &s;alvation by grace traduced as Antinomians and the doctrines of the word of God be&s;pattered, as &s;o many &s;ources of licention&s;ne&s;s. For in&s;tance, the preacher as his duty is, declares, "That &s;alvation is not of works but
<PB N="235" REF="027249_0233_0FD3ED3689DD3CF0">grace," and may thus rea&s;on with the people. "You can do nothing that will recommend you to the favour of God; the Ethiopian may change his hue, and the leopard his &s;pots, as &s;oon as you, who are accu&s;tomed to do evil, can change your own nature, and learn to do well; for it is not of works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which ye have done, or can do, that your &s;al|vation cometh, but merely by the calling of free mercy." I in&s;tantly clap my tele&s;cope to the eye of the legali&s;t, and he exclaims, "What an enemy to good works, is this &s;ame wretched antinomian? According to him, we may as well do nothing, as &s;trive to procure the favour of God; may as well lead lives the mo&s;t vile and profligate, as &s;tudy to live righteou&s;ly and holily; for according to this &s;ame preacher, our wickedne&s;s is as acceptable to God, as our mo&s;t holy and virtuous living. Yea, more acceptable; for he declares, that harlots and publicans &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, &s;ooner than tho&s;e who do what they can to procure eternal life by their holine&s;s and good works."</P>
<P>Such is the language not only of the vulgar and ignorant, but of many who profe&s;s to know much of religion. When|ever the &s;elf-&s;ufficient Arminius is in the humour to try the doctrines of the go&s;pel in cry inverting mirror, and the preachers of them in my partial tele&s;cope, he very candid|ly and with great liberality be&s;tows upon them &s;uch as the following reflections. "The&s;e wretched Calvini&s;ts repre|&s;ent the almighty God, as a partial and unmerciful being, who hides his go&s;pel and withholds his grace from men of virtue, wi&s;dom and prudence, whil&s;t he reveals him&s;elf to the mo&s;t notorious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. They &s;ay, that a man of a regular ino&s;ten&s;ive life may peri&s;h forever, when a mur|derer like Mana&s;&s;eh, a polluted pro&s;titute as Magdalen, and a wicked oppre&s;&s;or like Zaccheus &s;hall be &s;aved. If this is true, then we had better live notoriou&s;ly wicked, than &s;o|ber, righteous and godly lives. What wretched, what dangerous doctrine is this? They make God to be the au|thor of &s;in too; for they &s;ay that nothing comes to pa&s;s,
<PB N="236" REF="027249_0234_0FD3CD958A67ECD8">but by divine appointment or permi&s;&s;ion. They talk al&s;o of &s;ome horrible decree, in which God is &s;aid to have ordain|ed the things which are coming and &s;hall come. No need of holine&s;s, if &s;alvation is not of him that willeth; no need of diligence, if it is not of him that runneth, but to whom the Almighty &s;heweth mercy. If God hath mercy only up|on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, we may live as we plea&s;e; for if to be &s;aved we &s;hall not be damned, what diabolical doctrine is this?

<P>My &s;ire, I am all obedience to him who alone could give me being, and to re&s;ume the thread of my &s;tory would ob&s;erve, that &s;trange as it may &s;eem, I do, by the help of the&s;e amazing gla&s;&s;es make one evangelical mini&s;ter quarrel with another, and that merely becau&s;e they do not under|&s;tand each others manner of expre&s;&s;ion. One man, for in|&s;tance, will have it that Immanuel obtained his per&s;onality by eternal generation; another will have it to be by divine filiation; and another &s;till is content to believe him to be the only begotten of the Father, without attempting to explain how, or in what &s;en&s;e he is begotten or filiated. All of tho&s;e three are firm in the belief of Immanuel's &s;on&s;hip, his deity, and mediatorial capacity, as well as every doctrine of faith. And yet, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, tho&s;e very men &s;hall be &s;o prejudiced again&s;t one another, that they cannot comfortably have fellow&s;hip together; but may even prove injurious to each others u&s;efulne&s;s: and it may perhaps be very difficult to determine which of the three di&s;covers mo&s;t of a go&s;pel &s;pirit. Every one is in the right, and infallibly a&s;&s;ured that the other two ought to come into his opinion.</P>
<P>It is the very &s;ame with re&s;pect to diver&s;ity of gifts. One is led in a peculiar manner into the doctrines of faith, well able to &s;tate, define, and defend them again&s;t oppo&s;ition. Another is widely led about in the wilderne&s;s of temptation and affliction, by which he obtains peculiar talents in com|forting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and pouring oil into the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ding wounds of broken hearts. And a third is kept on the mount of enjoyment; his heart is kept warm by a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t, by which enjoyment he is active and lively in the work, a zealous promoter of practical godline&s;s. All of which gifts &s;eem to be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to a go&s;pel mini&s;try, and are all by the &s;ame &s;pirit. And yet, would you think it, the&s;e very men &s;hall treat one another as unfound in the faith in one &s;en&s;e or other? The fir&s;t is deemed a dead, dull and u&s;ele&s;s preacher, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time he is effectu|ally
<PB N="242" REF="027249_0240_0FD3ED33866538E8">&s;topping the mouths of gain-&s;ayers. The &s;econd, it is feared, loves to be peculiar, and verges a little towards Antinomiani&s;m, notwith&s;tanding many a feeble knee is &s;trengthened by his mini&s;try. And the third is a rambling incon&s;i&s;tent preacher, notwith&s;tanding by his in&s;trumentali|ty many are brought to a &s;eu&s;e of their &s;in and danger.</P>
<P>The&s;e quarrels are of great u&s;e to our government, as they fail not to reproach Chri&s;tianity, &s;tumble the weak believer, and grieve all good men. But this is not all. You know that two men may have the &s;elf &s;ame &s;entiments in religion; and yet one &s;hall choo&s;e to expre&s;s him&s;elf in this manner, and another in that, which difference of expre&s;&s;ion only may be attended with very &s;erion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;equences, if candour is not pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion. This was the ca&s;e with Tre|bonius and Theodorus. Theodorus heard Trebonius preach on a particular occa&s;ion, found him&s;elf offended with &s;ome of his expre&s;&s;ions, and thought it his duty to make the preacher acquainted with it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But as Tre|bonius has too good an opinion of his own attainments ea&s;ily to retract a &s;aying, he vindicated not only the doctrine, but the mode of expre&s;&s;ion. Theodorus was now more that e|ver per&s;uaded, that Trebonius was unfound in the faith, and was not &s;atisfied with verbally defending the truths of the go&s;pel, i. e. his own &s;entiments, but commenced a paper war with Trebonius. His apology for this &s;tep was indeed artful, for he lugged in both Chri&s;t and religion in|to partner&s;hip with him, and under their authority, or pre|tended authority, he did what he could to impeach the or|thodoxy, and mar the u&s;efulne&s;s of Trebonius.</P>
<P>When Trebonius read the performance, he found him|&s;elf aggrieved, and &s;omething within him being deeply wounded he re&s;olved on retaliation. To work he goes: fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hes his per&s;onal orthodoxy, which he al&s;o called the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, then vindicated his own proceedings, which by an happy turn of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ght he al&s;o linked with the honour of religion. Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e truth is, neither the go&s;|pel
<PB N="243" REF="027249_0241_0FD3ED242CAE1C40">of Chri&s;t nor the honour of religion had any concern at all in the &s;quabble. However, having fir&s;t &s;et him&s;elf and his doctrine in a re&s;pectable point of view, he proceeded diligently to &s;earch out and expo&s;e every blemi&s;h in the per|formance, and in the end did as much for his brother as he before had done for him. Thus tho&s;e two champious for the go&s;pel, that is for their own honour, went on expo&s;ing to the public, all they were acquainted with of each others weakne&s;&s;es and folly; never once &s;u&s;pecting that by &s;o do|ing each was expo&s;ing his own want of wi&s;dom, and a true Chri&s;tian &s;pirit. Mean while the friends of both were ex|ceedingly concerned, and in vain &s;tudied a reconciliation between them. But O what plea&s;ure did it afford our &s;oci|ety?

For ex|ample, about a century ago, the accurate Camillus preach|ed an excellent &s;ermon at Potheina, which was heard by &s;everal of the people to whom Junius was pa&s;tor; and they being greatly affected with the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the &s;ubject, and the practical manner in which it was handled, invited Camillus to vi&s;it them, and preach in Junius's pul|pit, not doubting but it would be altogether agreeable to their beloved pa&s;tor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll of the &s;ermon, when they came home they could not help making Junius partaker of their plea&s;ure. They expatiated largely upon the excellency of his method, the fertility of his illu&s;tration, and the propriety of his appli|cation, all of which they did not doubt but Junius would ad|mire as much as them&s;elves.

But the judicious &s;eldom think it prudent to &s;ay much in prai&s;e of any per&s;on to his face, how well &s;oever they may be affected towards him; and that for two very good rea&s;ons. (1.) Such commendation has not a little of the appearance of flattery, however &s;in|cere it may be in the party who be&s;tows it.

<P>People are in all things given to extremes, and either a mini&s;ter is care&s;t and almo&s;t adored as an unparalelled per|&s;on, or he has little or no notice taken of him. I remem|ber a remarkable in&s;tance of this in the la&s;t century. There was an independant church, who having a mini&s;ter of a lively addre&s;s and &s;ound doctrine, one who bid fair for great u&s;efulne&s;s among them; yet a lineal de&s;cendant of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otrephes, who loved to have the pre-eminence; and one who cho&s;e to direct them in all the concerns of life, in their families, in their bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as in the church. To his government they yielded them&s;elves implicitly, and almo&s;t adored the ground upon which he trod. With care&s;&s;es and &s;avours they loaded him, till they had rai&s;ed him to the very height of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and importance; from which they them&s;elves at la&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted to ca&s;t him down; and the contempt then poured upon him, pretty nearly equalled their former care&s;&s;es. After him they had another, of an almo&s;t contrary di&s;po&s;ition. He had but a very mean opinion of his own abilities, either for preaching or governing. He had &s;uch con&s;tant acquaintance with the power of his own corruptions, that he was commonly low and depre&s;t in &s;pirit. He never a&s;&s;umed any &s;uperiority over even the meane&s;t member, firmly believing him&s;elf to be the vile&s;t and mo&s;t unworthy &s;inner of the whole community; he &s;tood in need of all encouragement po&s;&s;ible, in order to hearten him for his work. Yet the &s;ame people who had de&s;troyed the for|mer with un&s;ea&s;onable kindne&s;s &s;uffered the later to drag on heavily all his days that from them he &s;eldom or never heard of his word having been made u&s;eful. And I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t have &s;unk under his di&s;couragements, if &s;trangers who after|wards came into the church had not been more free with him in di&s;covering &s;ome degree of affectionate regard.

<P>Sir, Junius would have his own humour; and ac|cordingly, when the time came that Camillus made his vi|fit any per&s;on attentive to Junius's behaviour, might ea&s;ily find that his friend's room would to him, have been more agreeable than his company; notwith&s;tanding for decency's &s;ake, he forced him&s;elf to carry it to him with &s;ome degree of &s;eeming civility: I &s;ay, &s;eeming, for even Chri&s;tian people have not as yet learned, to be exactly on all occa&s;ions what they &s;eem. But Camillus is a &s;agacious man, &s;oon perceived Junius's coldne&s;s through all his formal civility and &s;eeming deference. He began to que&s;tion with him&s;elf from whence this coldne&s;s might have proceeded? In what he might have given offence? But never dreams that jea|lou&s;y is at the bottom. Is he not offended with my doctrine? &s;aid he to him&s;elf. What can be the meaning of this di&s;tant carriage of his? What have I done or &s;aid that might give him umbrage? So Camillus rea&s;oned, but hit not upon the real cau&s;e. And as Camillus is &s;omewhat fond of his own &s;entiments, though a man inferior to few who are account|ed good and religious, he could not help being in doubt a|bout the orthodoxy of his friend. By the&s;e means, happily invented by me, this well-de&s;igned vi&s;it, in&s;tead of an&s;wer|ing the valuable ends of promoting religious friend&s;hip, ra|ther tended, by my intervention, to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enate their affections from each other.</P>
<P>Junius would &s;till have his own humour, and from that day forward di&s;covered a &s;hyne&s;s to tho&s;e, who &s;eemed mo&s;t delighted with Camill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; and when occa&s;ion offered, he did not &s;pare be&s;towing on them, what is called a dry rub.</P>
<P>This was not all, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could not leave his prejudice behind him when he went to the pulpit, where he adapted his di&s;cour&s;es accordingly. On the other hand his people
<PB N="248" REF="027249_0245_0FD3ED35433C23E8">could ea&s;ily &s;ee he was not in his u&s;ual &s;pirit; and they con|cluded, that they had given him no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence.</P>
<P>Mean while both parties mutually watched each others words and deportment. If Junius happened to &s;peak any thing har&s;h either from the pulpit or in common conver&s;a|tion, it was &s;aid to proceed from a bad &s;pirit.

<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have already heard how agreeable to his holi|ne&s;s my in&s;tructions were, as al&s;o of the laws by which the whole &s;y&s;tem of religion was inverted, and how the pious prie&s;t had inve&s;ted him&s;elf with the perfections of deity. I knew that the introduction of this new Chri&s;tianity might be attended with &s;ome difficulty, therefore advi&s;ed his holine&s;s, the father of the world, to deify &s;ome others as well as him|&s;elf; but at the &s;ame time, le&s;t his &s;upremacy &s;hould be in any wi&s;e infringed, to take care that none &s;hould be deified till after their death, and that only with an inferior rank of god&s;hip. He took my advice, canonized a va&s;t number under the title of &s;aints, and ordained ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid to them out of his own newly compo&s;ed bible: for the old bible in u&s;e among&s;t primitive Chri&s;tians having its laws &s;o con|trary to tho&s;e of the pope, was by his authority made null and void, and Rome once the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, be|came the mother of harlots? once more the &s;eat of pagan|i&s;m. But for di&s;tinction's &s;ake, we call the latter Chri&s;ti|an pagans, becau&s;e they exerci&s;e all their villainy under the &s;pecious &s;hew of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>In order to &s;upport the Chri&s;tian pantheon wor&s;hip, &s;laughter-hou&s;es were built, and called holy inqui&s;itions; where every one who was known to deny the &s;upremacy and in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lity of his holine&s;s the pope, or &s;o much as harbour a &s;u&s;picion concerning the papal faith, was treated with as little mercy as if he had been in hell. By the&s;e means, people were kept in the mo&s;t dreadful awe; &s;o that, if any man happened to be intelligent enough to &s;ee through the cheat, he was obliged to keep his mind to him&s;elf; well knowing that one word &s;poken again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">crative faith of the prie&s;ts, would have en&s;ured his certain death by means
<PB N="252" REF="027249_0250_0FD3ECCDE5D5DE08">the mo&s;t babarous and cruel. By this amazing &s;ubtility of prie&s;tcraft, with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity they cartied on their villainy, under the ma&s;k of &s;anctity for many centuries, and all Europe trembled at the indignation of the prie&s;thood. For by means of my brother's medals, and titles of eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i|a&s;tical dignity, together with my blinding influence, the various orders of reverend fathers, clave as fa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his holi|ne&s;s as &s;cales to one another on the impenetrable back of le|via<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han.</P>
<P>Yet terrible as the prie&s;thood were, they could not totally prevent the light of the go&s;pel &s;hining le&s;s or more, in &s;ome parts of Chri&s;tendom, e&s;pecially in Britain; where Wick|liffe and his di&s;ciples gave their reverences no &s;mall unea&s;i|ne&s;s; for which they poured vengeance upon his bones for|ty years after this demi&s;e. This &s;ame &s;cripture light kind|led in England by Wickli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e's mini&s;try, &s;pread it&s;elf to the continent, where fir&s;t John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s and Jerome of Prague, galled the &s;ides of popi&s;h prelates: for which the very pious council of Con&s;tance, fir&s;t recommended them to the care of the devil by excommunication, and then in the name of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">od of mercy, condemned to be burned to death for believing the bible. It is amazing to think, with what dex|terity they have lugged in the name of the Almighty, to fanctify their murders on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>About a century after this, a very &s;trict enquiry after truth began, by the in&s;trumentality of John Calvin and Martin Luther, two avowed enemies to popi&s;h wickedne&s;s. This revival of religion was very alarming to the prie&s;ts of Rome, and very injurious to my government. His infali|ble Holine&s;s in&s;tigated by the devil Crudelis, voted their immediate de&s;truction by fire and faggot, by poi&s;on, a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination, or any way; for there is nothing dreaded by this &s;ame vicar of Chri&s;t, &s;o much as the &s;preading of go&s;pel knowledge.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures however I with&s;tood, having from pa&s;t experience found, that coer&s;ive mea&s;ures are by no means
<PB N="253" REF="027249_0251_0FD3ECCF0E56B720">the mo&s;t likely to reduce profe&s;&s;ors of religion to the obedi|ence of infidelity; and I thought it better to &s;end the devil Di&s;cordans to vi&s;it them, with in&s;tructions to make them quarrel about the forms of religion, this I took to be the mo&s;t likely method to invalidate the te&s;timony of both, and to baffle and confound their followers. This was done, and they jarred exceedingly about circum&s;tantials; but do what we would, they &s;pake of the doctrines which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, with perfect uniformity, which great|ly fru&s;trated our dark de&s;igns; and this fire of reformation &s;o lately fanned, by degrees &s;pread it&s;elf on the Continent, and in Great-Britain, where it aro&s;e in the days of Wick|liffe.</P>
<P>The pope and me being loth to give up the government, we had always been accu&s;tomed to have in the&s;e nations, did what we could to &s;tifie the reformation: but alas, it went on with rapidity in the days of Edward, and might have made greater advances than it has ever yet done, if luckily for his holine&s;s and me, that prince had not been ta|ken away in early life. Mary being a prince&s;s ju&s;t fitted to our turn, no &s;ooner a&s;cended the throne than I flew to En|gland, accompanied by the devil Crudelis, re&s;olving at all events to cru&s;h with oppre&s;&s;ion, all who rebelled again&s;t me and his holine&s;s. To this &s;alutary purpo&s;e were tran&s;port|ed from the pope's ar&s;enal, abundance of hempen cord and faggots beyond number, that we might oblige the people to renounce Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and wor&s;hip his Romi&s;h infallibility.</P>
<P>There were in tho&s;e days two lu&s;ty bi&s;hops, right rever|end tyrants in the devil, Bonner of London, and Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, who hearing of our arrival, came equipped in their prelatic robes, to do us greeting, and bid us welcome to the Briti&s;h &s;hore. This brace of right reverend prelates, we appointed prime inqui&s;itors in matters of faith, and prin|cipal agents of our intended cruelty: indeed none that ever &s;u&s;tained the office of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie&s;t, ever were more tru&s;ty friends,

But as it happened in former per&s;ecutions, &s;o it fell out in this. The a&s;hes of burned &s;aints proved &s;uch fertilizing manure to the church, that in defiance both of hell and the pope the dete&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Nazarenes became by far more numerous Wherefore, if our friend Mary, of zealous and &s;carlet memory, had not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n &s;ummoned hence to re|ceive her reward, the poor devil Crude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have de&s;i&s;ted merely from ince&s;&s;ant and un&s;ucce&s;sful fatigue, and the Nazarenes would have obtained re&s;t, &s;olely from our de&s;peration.</P>
<P>But when Immanuel beheld &s;uch havock made of his church, and &s;o many places bathed with &s;anctified blood, his wrath took the alarm; in his judgment he cut down the zealous queen and her two tru&s;ty bi&s;hops, and rai&s;ed queen Bet&s;y to the throne of England. Now the &s;word of per&s;e|cution was wre&s;ted from the hands of the papi&s;ts, and the good people of the church of England, did for the puritans what the zealous papi&s;ts had done for them during the reign of queen Mary. This &s;ame queen Elizabeth, was a great zealot for high church, and a vigorous nur&s;e of epi&s;copa|cy; but the Browni&s;ts and other di&s;&s;enters, felt the full weight of her regal vengeance. I happily prevailed unex|pectedly with the divines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, to re|tain the more refined part of the popi&s;h &s;y&s;tem; which tho&s;e men who were for a thorough reformation, both in doctrine and di&s;cipline, could not comply with; and for their non-compliance, we taught them that the arm of e|pi&s;copacy is every whit as heavy as that of popery, when it is exerted for the good of the church. And for my own
<PB N="255" REF="027249_0253_0FD3ECD2D48F5DE0">part I prompted their reverences, to coer&s;ive mea&s;ures, be|ing very apprehen&s;ive, that the reformation might have been carried on farther than it really was.</P>

"Well, gentlemen, &s;aid I, do you intend to come to a thorough reformation then, and reduce Chri&s;tianity to its primitive &s;implicity?

<PB N="256" REF="027249_0254_0FD3ECD4759A3E88">the di&s;tribution of the fore-mentioned medais. I went at|tired in my robes of &s;late, to deliver one of my archiepi&s;co|palian medals to a certain prie&s;t; whom I in&s;tantly created "His grace and mo&s;t reverend." He mumbled over to him&s;elf &s;everal times; "mo&s;t reverend, his grace," view|ing the medal with the clo&s;e&s;t attention.

Yes, my lord, &s;aid I, it is very mu|&s;ical, and what I my&s;elf only am capable of compo&s;ing. A mode of addre&s;s very becoming the dignity of an archbi&s;hop. Humble preachers, &s;uch as Peter, Paul, Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thy, and Titus, might be very well contented, without being their graces and mo&s;t reverend, for they were not as you are, courtiers, clothed in &s;oft raiment. But for a &s;piritual courtier, for the primate of a province, to pro&s;titute his name to vul|gar mouths, would be highly unbecoming, would greatly eclip&s;e the honours of your elevated &s;tation. "But worthy, &s;ir, returned he, you know this is a very cen&s;orious world in which we live, and &s;ome people may be wicked enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a title as, his grace, does not &s;o well become a man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, and I may be cen&s;ured as ambitious." I hope, my lord, replied I, you will not meditate too much on the gloomy &s;ubject of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|lity, or that will make your dignity cumber&s;ome indeed. Honours fade, &s;ir, on the pro&s;pect of the grave. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to your being cen&s;ured as proud and ambitious, I hold the con|trary; it will be deemed e&s;&s;ential to your high e&s;tate, and the u&s;e of the bible being prohibited, the laity will not know but your order is of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution. Be&s;ides, there is my lord duke enjoys the &s;ame title of addre&s;s with your grace; &s;o that in&s;tead of being cen&s;ured as proud and anti|chri&s;tian, all ranks of people will revere you the more for it; e&s;pecially, as it will make you a fit companion for princes. The nobility will con&s;ider you as their &s;uperior, in as much as a &s;piritual duke is &s;uperior to a temporal, &s;o that in the church your &s;eat will be next to the cardinals, and in the

<P>I would farther advi&s;e you, to lay a&s;ide preaching to the vulgar race, and apply your&s;elf wholly to affairs of &s;tate; un|le&s;s called to it, may be once in &s;even years, to preach to the king and his nobles. "Ay, replied the the worthy prelate, but how &s;hall I di&s;pen&s;e with the obligations I am under as a bi&s;hop, to meditate on the&s;e things, to give my&s;elf wholly to the mini&s;try of the word and prayer, yea, to be in&s;tant in preaching the word in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on?" Oh &s;ir, replied I, you need to be under no concern about that. "Surely, &s;ir, that is the duty of a bi&s;hop, replied he." Yes, very true, &s;aid I; the duty of bi&s;hops, &s;uch as were in the apo&s;tles days; &s;uch bi&s;hops as are appointed in the New Te&s;tament. But what has that to do with a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop or an archbi&s;hop, of whom you your&s;elf are the fir&s;t. There were none of them you know in the apo&s;tles days; none ap|pointed in the word of God. And therefore the laws which bind &s;criptural bi&s;hops to obedience, can have no manner of power over you as dioce&s;ans; much le&s;s can a metropolitan, &s;uch a bi&s;hop as the apo&s;tles never thought of, be under any &s;uch injunctions. Surely your grace mu&s;t know that a lord bi&s;hop, or a gracious metropolitan mu&s;t have enough to do without preaching the go&s;pel. Yet if the&s;e things are not &s;ufficient to remove the &s;cruples of your mind; and you &s;hould &s;till have a notion, that preaching is a duty incum|bent on you, I can put you in a way to &s;atisfy your con&s;ci|ence, without abating any thing of your greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Pray, &s;ir, be &s;o kind," &s;aid he May it plea&s;e your grace, replied I, it is neither more nor le&s;s than to preach by proxy, as people plead their cau&s;es in a court of judica|ture.

How far beneath the character of &s;uch a &s;piritual dignitaly, to be down on his knees amid&s;t his &s;ervants, wor&s;hipping his maker? Let me advi&s;e you, either to lay a&s;ide family wor&s;hip altogether, or have it performed by a chaplain. This will have two very great advantages attending it. 1. It will &s;ave your grace a great deal of hard and unplea&s;ant la|bour. And 2. It will make your grace's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ety to be admir|ed by the vulgar. Methinks I hear one &s;ay to another, "What a good man is my lord, the archbi&s;hop? for al|though he is too high for &s;aying prayers him&s;elf; or has got &s;o much that he has no need to pray, he gives a good &s;ala|ry to Mr. Honeylip duly to perform the offices of religion in his &s;tead,"</P>
<P>All this while, the good archbi&s;hop continued ab&s;orbed in thought, and awakening as from a trance, he &s;aid, with a&s;toni&s;hment glowing on his countenance. "Sir, you a|maze me! So pertinent your coun&s;el, &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive your ad|dre&s;s. You have more than half brought me over to your opinion, as my future conduct will te&s;tify."</P>
<P>Having &s;ucceeded even beyond expectation with his grace the archbi&s;hop, I waited immediately on all the dioce&s;ans, within the pomifical juri&s;diction, and took the mo&s;t likely mea&s;ures to bring them over to our intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. I per&s;uaded them, as I had done the archbi&s;hop be|fore them, that the worldly grandeur with which I and his holine&s;s had inve&s;ted them, was certainly too heavy a bur|den for them, to be able to a&s;cend the pulpit &s;tairs, above once or twice a year; and that even then it ought not to be to preach to an ordinary congregation.</P>

<P>The only way in the world, cou&s;in. Had the king of England given a bi&s;hoprick to the noi&s;y Whitefield, as he was advi&s;ed to do by a certain nobleman; it is unknown what mi&s;chief might have been prevented. A bi&s;hoprick would have done him more real injury, than if all the bi|&s;hops in England had written again&s;t him. You remember well, how Dr. D&mdash;d once threatened our ruin, and promi&s;|ed fair for doing a mi&s;chief to our government; till our happy &s;tars fixt him in a prebend's &s;tall, and a r&mdash;l chap|lain&s;hip; &s;ince which time he has been quiet enough, and lets people &s;leep on and take their re&s;t &s;ecurely.</P>

<P>Having &s;ecured both orders of popi&s;h bi&s;hops, I took care to e&s;tabli&s;h deans, abbots, monks, friars, vicars, chaunters, prebendaries, canons, minor canons, &amp;c. &amp;c. From thence I proceeded to per&s;uade the higher orders of clergy, to encourage plurality of livings, well knowing that if a country vicar could but procure a fat and fruitful be|nefice, he would even imitate his betters, and preach as lit|tle as po&s;&s;ible. I have often with great plea&s;ure ob&s;erved, that if a benefice exceed two hundred pounds per annum, the poor vicar who enjoys it, finds him&s;elf very unable to preach, and is therefore obliged to hire a journeyman, to whom he leaves the bulk of his bu&s;ine&s;s. By the&s;e means we got curates introduced into the church; a &s;et of gentle|men &s;old to &s;lavery and inured to poverty, not for want of parts and learning, nor always for want of piety, but for want of what is far more nece&s;&s;ary to preferment, a pa|tron&punc; A journeyman weaver, watch-maker, or cabinet|maker, can afford a better table than many a gentleman, who lacks nothing but a patron, to make him equal to the very fir&s;t of bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="027249_0258_0FD3ECDD596BD7D0">
Happily it ju&s;t an&s;wered our de&s;ire, and was not long before a &s;harp conflict between the vicars and curates en&s;ued; as it is not without a vein of drollery, I &s;hall give you a &s;ketch of it. There was a certain vicar, who having ob|tained a living of about 800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, called his curate to him one day, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "Mr. Curate, I am now in a &s;tation which will admit but of little preaching; I mu&s;t therefore get you to take that part of the &s;ervice principally upon your&s;elf; I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of vi&s;it|ing the neighbouring gentlemen, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in their polite amu&s;ements, as has been the cu&s;tom of my predece&s;|&s;ors for time immemorial; &s;o that little of my time can be devoted to preaching or praying, and le&s;s &s;till to &s;tudy and contemplation." Mr. Curate replied, "Indeed, Sir, I am but a poor bireling, who&s;e &s;canty allowance is no way ade|quate to labours &s;o exten&s;ive. I am re&s;olved, &s;ir, to mea|&s;ure my &s;ervices by my annual &s;alary." The vicar's bene|fice being &s;ufficient to rai&s;e him above preaching, and the curate's allowance &s;o &s;mall, that he could not afford to preach much, it &s;o fell out between vicar and curate, that the pa|ri&s;hioners could not obtain above twenty minutes preaching weekly, in return for their tythes, many dues and offerings. This you know was greatly to our advantage.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of altercation, between the vicar and curate, I well remember, which al&s;o was decided in our fa|vour. "Hark you Mr. Curate, (&s;aid a certain vicar one day to his journeyman) I expect you &s;hall take the care of all the &s;ouls within my pari&s;h, upon your&s;elf; as I have much bu&s;ine&s;s of a very different nature on my hands." "I take the care of them, &s;ir, (replied his curate&s;hip) what have I to do with them? I &s;hall take no care of them, I a&s;|&s;ure you." "Well, but Mr. Curate, &s;aid the vicar, I hired you on purpo&s;e that you &s;hould take the care of them off from me." "Indeed, &s;ir, rejoined the curate, I will not, I am re&s;olved; do you think that for the &s;canty allowance of twelve &s;hillings per week, I will put my own &s;oul in the
<PB N="261" REF="027249_0259_0FD3ECDD5D652D50">place of your pari&s;hioners! No, &s;ir, let him take the care of them, who is be&s;t paid for &s;o doing." "Then, &s;aid the vicar, let my lord bi&s;hop take care of them, for he is better paid than either vicar or curate." By the&s;e means the pari&s;hioners may go to heaven or hell, as mo&s;t &s;uits their inclination, provided always the fees are punctually paid.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, father, I really think tho&s;e curates were in the right; for as they receive but journeyman's wages for doing the drudgery of the bu&s;ine&s;s, it is unrea&s;onable to de|&s;ire more than journey man's labour from them. If they per|form the more &s;ervile parts of the office, for their &s;canty allowance, it &s;eems but meet the vicars, who receive the far greate&s;t part of the profits, &s;hould take the burthen of &s;ouls upon them&s;elves. If I am not greatly mi&s;taken, the far greater part of mankind, the vicars and high-prie&s;ts alone excepted, are of the &s;ame opinion with me and the curate. However, that was all in the days of popery, and the church of England, hath &s;ince been ble&s;&s;ed with a great reformation.</P>

<P>It has &s;o, Impiator, and been deformed again, al|mo&s;t far enough. Some time after the reformation indeed, the go&s;pel was preached almo&s;t every wher: in England, which made me apprehend the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences, and made m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exert my utmo&s;t influence, in order to re|duce the clergy to obedience.</P>
<P>This important point was in a great mea&s;ure carried, by fixing their attention inordinately upon tradition, and kind|ling relentings in the bo&s;om of many a gown&s;man, towards the old &s;carlet lady, who&s;e government had been rejected. So, that by degrees I drew them to take council, as former|ly, from the wife Infidelis; one particular in&s;tance of which I &s;hall give you, if you think it will not too long detain you from nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only a little confabulation I had with my good friend, par&s;on Out-and-in. The ca&s;e was this: I &s;et out one morning for Rome, to remove &s;ome &s;cruples which in|fe&s;ted the mind of his holine&s;s, the father of the world; but pa&s;&s;ing by par&s;on Out-and-in's garden, I beheld the re|verend gentleman in his morning gown and velvet cap, walk|ing &s;low and pen&s;ive, to all appearance in a dejected manner. Charity bid me &s;top and relieve the thoughtful divine. At her command I &s;topped, and called: So&mdash;ho, Mr. Out-and|in; how do you do? The good gentleman awaking as from a trance, erected his body into a perpendicular po&s;ture, pu&s;h|ed up the &s;nout of his cap from over his eyes, and finding it was me who called, in&s;tantly replied. "O my good friend, Ratio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lis! (for that is the name by which I am known by the clergy of all denominations) am I &s;o happy as to meet with you, in this &s;o difficult &s;ea&s;on? I pray you, mo&s;t honourable tutor, be plea&s;ed to &s;top and give me your advice."</P>
<P>I went to him, and thus the old Levite began. "Mo&s;t truly, noble, and intelligent &s;ir, I and my brethren, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nuine children of learning and &s;cience, have long been much grieved at the rapid progre&s;s of fanatici&s;m, which now prevails amazingly over the people; &s;o prevalent is it, &s;ir, that fanatical preachers are more followed, more e&s;teem|ed than we, the votaries of almighty rea&s;on. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> days, &s;ir, there are &s;ome, who in a frantic manner decry the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|ble powers of the human &s;oul, which we e&s;teem to be almo&s;t divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who preach &s;alvation, by what they call the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="263" REF="027249_0261_0FD3ECE043E61BA0">of Chri&s;t, contrary to the in&s;tructions which we re|ceive from that illumitration which thou ha&s;t given us. We have long been &s;tudying how to &s;uppre&s;s this fanatici&s;m, and to promote the more con&s;i&s;tent doctrine of &s;alvation by our own works, and the liberty and freedom of our own will to perform perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is intolerable, &s;ir, to hear men of virtue and piety, placed on a level with vile publicans and &s;inners, who know not the law, and are therefore accur&s;ed. Impious in the highe&s;t degree, to &s;up|po&s;e that the benevolent Deity will not reward our good en|deavours to plea&s;e him, by working out our own &s;alvation, without tru&s;ting in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of another."</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, &s;aid I, to gentlemen of virtue and goodne&s;s, it mu&s;t be very mortifying to &s;ubmit to be levelled with tho&s;e who work not, but believe in him who ju&s;tifieth the ungodly. Very trying, indeed, to own one's &s;elf to be an hell-de&s;erv|ing &s;inner, when your own rea&s;on bears witne&s;s, that you de&s;erve the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of everla&s;ting happine&s;s, for your own per&s;onal goodne&s;s. What man of virtue and moral goodne&s;s, what gentleman of a clear head and good heart, like your&s;elf, can bear to be told, that harlots and publicans &s;hall enter the kingdom of heaven &s;ooner than you? I wonder not, my worthy &s;ir, that the preaching of &s;alvation by the works of another, &s;hould be a &s;tone of perpetual &s;tum|bling, and a rock of invincible offence to you. And this offence will never be removed, till we can &s;o manage it, that this &s;ame book called Scripture, is made to truckle to the more con&s;i&s;tent dictates of human rea&s;on; by which a|lone the authenticity of doctrine ought to be atte&s;ted, inde|pondently of any records whatever, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf have beheld the preaching of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, with a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s; but for &s;eeing the &s;elf-righteous Jews break their bones by &s;tumbling upon it, and the wi&s;e philo&s;ophic Grecians turning merry-andrews, and laughing at it as &s;ooli&s;hne&s;s, I &s;hould certainly have &s;unk into de&s;pair: becau&s;e I was unhappy enough to &s;ee it prove
<PB N="264" REF="027249_0262_0FD3ECE596C63B10">both the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God, to tho&s;e who felt them&s;elves actually in a peri&s;hing condition. But my good Mr. Out-and-in, permit me to tell you, that whatever pain I endure on account of a preached go&s;pel, I can do nothing that will effectually prevent it, without the concurrence of the clergy. By the way, let me not &s;o much as hint any defection of the clergy. No, &s;ir, I thank my au&s;picious &s;tars, by far the greate&s;t part of them are upon the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion. There are but few, very few, who preach tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic doctrines, with which the articles, homilies, and rubric are &s;tuffed; very few who concern them&s;elves about what is, or what is not, the doctrine of the bible.</P>
<P>But, to the matter of your troubles, &s;ir, I apprehend they may be reduced to the&s;e two heads only: To &s;uppre&s;s the growth of fanatici&s;m on the one hand, and &s;ecure to your&s;elves the patrimony of the church on the other. "The&s;e are all, returned he, if we can but accompli&s;h the&s;e, we de&s;ire no more." Then, &s;ir, if no more is aim|ed at, I &s;hall put you in a way by which you may-accom|pli&s;h them.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve me then, my good friend Mr. Out-and-in, the fir&s;t thing to be done, is, to draw as thick a vail as po&s;&s;ible over the per&s;onal excellencies, grace, and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Immanuel; for the&s;e, wherever they are preached, have a tendency to eclip&s;e all human glory, and greatly to dimi|ni&s;h the profits of the altar; which you know are the prin|cipal things that ought to be advanced. The holy trade of prie&s;tcraft can never pro&s;per, but in proportion to your de|parture from the doctrine of the cro&s;s. Yet this mu&s;t be done with caution, le&s;t the eyes of the people &s;hould be open|ed, and the propagation of your rational religion be pre|vented. The important que&s;tion then is, "How you may retain the character and authority of Chri&s;t's amba&s;&s;adors, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time you are labouring to extirpate the doctrine of &s;alvation by his blood, from the rational world;
<PB N="265" REF="027249_0263_0FD3ECE95037E2D0">as you cannot expect to be &s;o much regarded by the people, if ever you lo&s;e your claim to amba&s;&s;ador&s;hip. Of this there|fore you mu&s;t be very cautious, and by no means declare your&s;elves avowed enemies to the go&s;pel in &s;o many expre&s;s words.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir, you mu&s;t find out the mo&s;t glorious names which po&s;&s;ibly can be a&s;cribed to the Son of God, yet &s;uch names as do not imply his per&s;onal divinity; the&s;e would &s;poil your &s;cheme, and therefore mu&s;t be rejected. For in&s;tance, you mu&s;t not call him Immanuel, the mighty God, the ever|la&s;ting Father, God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ye&s;terday, to day and for-ever the &s;ame; Alpha and Omega, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e and &s;uch like names mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be laid a&s;ide, for they make directly again&s;t the rational &s;cheme. On the other hand, you mu&s;t be equally careful not to &s;peak &s;lightly of his per&s;on, name, and authority, by barefacedly calling him, but a man like your&s;elves, as Doctor Prie&s;tley has precipitately done; and by &s;o doing betrayed the cau&s;e of rational religion into the hands of the orthodox, to be mangled and tortured after the manner of that wicked Shaver. In &s;hort you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the people are not all rational alike, and therefore a downright denial of the Godhead of Chri&s;t may be attended with very &s;erious con|&s;equences. Some people are &s;irmly attached to the Athana|&s;ian creed, merely out of deference to the judgment of their ance&s;tors; and others are as firmly attached to the &s;crip|tures, from an inward conviction of their divine propriety; &s;o that without the greate&s;t care you may be baffled in your very fir&s;t attempts to promulgate your rational religion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;ir, notwith&s;tanding you believe him to be but man like your&s;elf, or at mo&s;t but a dignified creature, you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, for fear of the populace, give him a kind of &s;uffragan deity or deputed Godhead, like that of Mars or Mercury, in the pagan theology. Your friend Mr. Whi&s;|ton, a man of deep intelligence, has &s;hewn you what may
<PB N="266" REF="027249_0264_0FD3ECE954333808">be done in this way; do you, my good Mr. Out-and-in, imitate the &s;ame Homer-like mini&s;ter
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Homer-like mini&s;ter. Homer was a wonderful creator of gods and godde&s;&s;es, and &s;o was Mr. Whi&s;ton, from his own account of the Trinity, which he makes to con&s;i&s;t of one uncre|ated, and two created Gods.</NOTE>. To be more par|ticular, you mu&s;t never omit when you &s;peak of him, to u&s;e great and &s;welling words of &s;eeming re&s;pect, as if you had the mo&s;t profound veneration for his per&s;on; call him the only Son of the mo&s;t high God&mdash;the fir&s;t-born, and mo&s;t exalted of creatures&mdash;a being far above men and angels&mdash; under God, the great di&s;pen&s;er of all things, both in earth and heaven. Not a &s;yllable of his mea&s;uring the &s;eas in the hollow of his hand; of his meting out heaven with the &s;pan; of his comprehending the du&s;t of the earth in a mea&s;ure; weighing the mountains in &s;cales, and the hills in a balance; or of his taking up the i&s;les as a very little thing. That is a de&s;cription of Je&s;us, mo&s;t adver&s;e to what you would have thought to be rational religion, which con&s;iders him as no more than a man like your&s;elves; it is good therefore that &s;uch de&s;criptions &s;hould never be quoted. By keeping clo&s;e to tho&s;e appellations which are proper to him, only as man and mediator, you will vail his real per&s;onal dignity, and in time your audience will quite forget all their old orthodox notions, concerning the proper deity of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which at pre&s;ent are &s;o very offen&s;ive to you and your brethren.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you happen to hear of any man, who is a zea|lous and diligent preacher of Chri&s;t crucified, as the only foundation of the &s;inner's hope, you mu&s;t look to it that &s;omething be &s;peedily done, to prevent his &s;ucce&s;s, for &s;uch a man is capable of being very injurious to us and our ra|tional religion. His followers will con&s;ider you as no better than birelings, mercenary prie&s;ts, and enemies to the go&s;|pel of &s;alvation. Therefore you mu&s;t, but always with the greate&s;t art, attack his character. Stigmatize him with
<PB N="267" REF="027249_0265_0FD3ECEBEC64D288">&s;uch names of reproach as you think will be mo&s;t likely to take with the vulgar. However you mu&s;t be aware of touching his moral character, for that will be like the body of Achilles, invulnerable even to malice it&s;elf. His religi|ous character, becau&s;e le&s;s under&s;tood by the common peo|ple, will be more ea&s;ily injured, and therefore the mo&s;t proper object of your attacks.</P>
<P>You may call him an enthu&s;ia&s;t, which is a name under|&s;tood by very few; therefore the greate&s;t part of the people will con&s;ider him as &s;ome outlandi&s;h mon&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and avoid him as they would &s;hun the path of a crocodile. Or you may call him a methodi&s;t; this al&s;o is a name well calculated to excite popular abhorrence, as you know many would rather choo&s;e to be papi&s;ts than methodi&s;ts. Or you may call him an anabapti&s;t, or fanatic. In &s;hort you may dre&s;s him in what names you think will mo&s;t effectually &s;tir up the peo|ple to bait him as they would do a bull or a bear from the fore&s;t; and &s;o far as your influence goes, you may totally prevent his u&s;efulne&s;s; which you know will be a great &s;er|vice done to the devil, and to rational religion.</P>
<P>But my good Mr. Out-and-in, take care that you be not too bare-&s;aced in your &s;landers, as Doctor Prie&s;tely has been in his again&s;t the orthodox di&s;&s;enters. His zeal for rational religion is &s;o furious, that it prompted him to rend the di&s;|gui&s;e, which ought by all means to have concealed his im|placable hatred of the orthodox. This however he has thought proper to di&s;cover in &s;uch a manner, that his word in a way of &s;lander, will now &s;carcely be taken by any bo|dy, &s;o that even the rationals them&s;elves are a&s;hamed of his ra&s;hne&s;s. But you, my friend, may avail your&s;elf of his mi&s;carriage, and avoid the rock upon which he foundered un|der full &s;ail, by con&s;idering that, among&s;t the laity there are always to be found a di&s;cerning few, who&s;e penetration may be too keen for a flim&s;y di&s;gui&s;e. Now, &s;hould your ma|lice be detected, your very reproaches would bring him pro&s;elytes, as in the ca&s;e of Dr. Trapp, of crabbed memory,
<PB N="268" REF="027249_0266_0FD3ED05C54B1270">and the late Mr. Whitefield, Therefore let all your re|proaches &s;eem to flow rather from pity than malice. Do not fail to commend &s;omething of the good that is in him; this will be an excellent cloke, from under which you may with the greater freedom &s;hoot your arrows of calumny. For example, when his name is mentioned in company, you may &s;ay, "He is a good &s;ort of man, I believe; but I am &s;orry for him, poor man, he hath imbibed &s;ad enthu&s;i|a&s;tic principles. The poor weak, well meaning man would do good if he could, I believe, but is &s;adly led away by me|thodi&s;tical notions." Sir, there are a thou&s;and ways of vending &s;candal with &s;eeming pity, which &s;ome people are perfect ma&s;ters of; but your divines are too warm, and therefore their arrows fall to the ground before they inflict any wound at all.</P>

<P>Not enemies to all creeds, cou&s;in; only to tho&s;e creeds which they deem orthodox; tho&s;e which deba&s;e the &s;inner, exalt the Saviour, and thwart the views of human arrogance. But they are very fond of &s;uch creeds as tickle proud nature, eclip&s;e the &s;overeignty of grace, and deba&s;e the Saviour, as in&s;ufficient of him&s;elf to &s;ave to the utter|mo&s;t tho&s;e that come to God by him: as you will &s;ee in the following.</P>
<P>"I believe in the great God, the Father and fountain of Deity, as an ab&s;olute and &s;upreme being, eternal, im|mortal, invi&s;ible, omnipre&s;ent, all-powerful, the Creator, Supporter, and Governor of all worlds. I believe in ano|ther God, who is not eternal in his exi&s;tence, not omni|pre&s;ent in his e&s;&s;ence; not omnipotent, but intirely depend|ent on the great God for his very exi&s;tence; not &s;upreme over all, as Paul the fanatic thought, but &s;ubject in all things to him that made him; not immortal, but actually died about &s;eventeen hundred years ago, for purpo&s;es af|terwards to be mentioned. I farther believe, concerning this &s;econd God, that he was created, as the famous Whil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on &s;ays, by the great God in an ineffable manner, be|fore the foundation of the world, far above all angels, and appointed to be the mini&s;ter of the wrath and mercy of
<PB N="272" REF="027249_0270_0FD3ED0D45646EA0">the Creator. I believe in a third God, called the Holy Gho&s;t, created by the &s;econd God, or &s;uffragan of the &s;u|preme Deity, and that therefore he may properly be cal|led the grand&s;on of the great God."&mdash;</P>
<P>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> beg your pardon, &s;aid Mr. Out-and-in, interrupting me, it would be more rational &s;till, to a&s;cribe no deity whatever to the Son of God."</P>
<P>O &s;ir, replied I, we &s;hall fit you in that in the mo&s;t agreeable manner; then to the article of faith in the great God, add, "I believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a mere man like our&s;elves, yet pious and holy. A man &s;ent of God, as a great teacher, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s in life was to introduce a new mild law, commonly called the go&s;pel; becau&s;e God had altered his mind re&s;pecting the &s;alvation of mankind, &s;ince his giving of the old law, which upon examination, and long experience, was found to be too &s;trict and &s;evere, con&s;equently unju&s;t and fit for abolition. Wherefore he rai&s;ed up this &s;ame Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a man like our&s;elves, and &s;ent him to correct the errors which infinite wi&s;dom had fallen into, in giving what we call the moral law. I be|lieve, that when he obtained a perfect correct copy, he taught it to mankind, and called it the new law, or the go&s;pel. I believe that this good man actually did make &s;uch correc|tions, alterations and amendments in the moral law as he &s;aw meet, notwith&s;tanding he po&s;itively declared, that "although heaven and earth &s;hould both pa&s;s away, not one jot or tittle of the old law &s;hould fail, i. e. be &s;uper|ceded by any other law whatever. I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, this good man like our&s;elves, having rendered the old law a perfect &s;y&s;tem, and having taught it in its puri|fied &s;tate, died to confirm the truth of his doctrine, ju&s;t as Cranmer and other good men have done &s;ince then. I be|lieve farther, that he continued under the power of death for three days, and then was rai&s;ed from the dead, to &s;hew that he was no impo&s;ter, but was actually commi&s;&s;ioned to amend the old law, which, prior to his correction, was
<PB N="273" REF="027249_0271_0FD3ECEE9DA07130">neither holy, ju&s;t, nor good, as the mi&s;taken apo&s;tle thought it to be. Farther &s;till, I believe that in his exalted &s;tate he is, as good Dr. Prie&s;tley ob&s;erves, only a man like our&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding the orthodox ignorantly wor&s;hip him as Immanuel, God with them; God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h; the true God and eternal life; the Alpha and Omega; the fir&s;t and the la&s;t; and I know not what enthu&s;ia&s;tic titles, &s;uch as that book called the bible a&s;cribe to Je&s;us of Naza|reth.</P>
<P>Concerning the original &s;tate of man, I believe, that A|dam did not beget his children in the likene&s;s which he him|&s;elf bore, at the time of their being begotten, but in the likene&s;s which he bore before he had &s;inned; that although the fountain became polluted, the &s;treams continue pure and limpid; and although the root was depraved by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the branches and fruit are holy and innocent. So that there is no &s;uch thing as orginal &s;in in any &s;en&s;e; nor have the po&s;terity of Adam any &s;hare in the guilt of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. And whereas, the death of infants is frequently alledged by fanatics, and orthodox Chri&s;tians as a proof of original &s;in. I do mu&s;t rationally believe concerning tho&s;e that die in in|fancy, that either God in an arbitrary unju&s;t manner mur|ders them without cau&s;e; or that their death is occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;in of their own, committed either whil&s;t they were in the womb, or before they had being; for no man can die for the &s;ins of another, &s;ays your oracle, and yet it is clear that infants do die.</P>
<P>Moreover, I believe that every man is po&s;&s;e&s;t of power, to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by the deeds of the law, and to procure &s;alvation by his own willing and running, contrary to the opinion of Paul, and the re&s;t of the orthodox; that &s;alva|tion is obtained by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own per|forming, and not by the obedience and death of any per&s;on whatever; that the glory of our &s;alvation &s;hall redound to the ab&s;olute mercy of God, and our own good endeavours to obtain it; and not unto Chri&s;t, whom the orthodox en|thu&s;ia&s;tically
<PB N="274" REF="027249_0272_0FD3ED0D48E09540">&s;ay, has loved them, and wa&s;hed them in his blood, by which he has redeemed them to God out of every nation, kindred, people, tongue and language."</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very thing, in which their idolatry con&s;i&s;ts, and is on a level with that of the ancient pagans. It was an inferior kind of adoration, which the antients paid to their heroes and common Deities, in compari&s;on of that, which they offered to Jupiter their great God, the &s;uppo&s;ed king and father of all the re&s;t. Mars and Mercury, for in&s;tance, were never con&s;idered as &s;upreme, but as acting under the direction and delegation of Jupiter; as &s;uch, and &s;uch on|ly they were adored and wor&s;hiped; &s;o that to di&s;tingui&s;h between the wor&s;hip of the Father as &s;upreme, and that of his Son, as inferior and &s;ubordinate, in&s;tead of exculpating them from the charge of idolatry, doth actually enforce it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But to clear them&s;elves from the charge of idola|try they alledge farther, &s;ir, the command of God him&s;elf, for their wor&s;hipping the Son, notwith&s;tanding his inferiori|ty. The great God, &s;ay they, hath given command that all the angels of God &s;hould wor&s;hip him, and that all men &s;hould honour him; &s;hall then our obedience draw upon us the reproach of idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they &s;ay. But if they knew the &s;criptures, only half as well as you and me, who have laboured all our days to cloud their evidence, they would &s;ee that the&s;e com|mands, in&s;tead of exculpating them from, do actually bring home the charge of idolatry upon them. God hath expre&s;s|ly commanded, that, "Mankind &s;hall have no other Gods before him," as objects of religious adoration, either by office or otherwi&s;e: And he would hardly have him&s;elf in|troduced another, of a different nature, and commanded all men to wor&s;hip him; &s;eeing in this ca&s;e, one command would have cla&s;hed with the other. This would have been
<PB N="277" REF="027249_0275_0FD3ECF18218C9F8">the &s;pring of wild confu&s;ion, and everla&s;ting uncertainty; for the two commands being diametrically oppo&s;ite, no man could ever have known which of the two might be obeyed with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Would we but &s;uffer them to reflect upon the divine com|mands, they mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ee, that their wor&s;hipping of the Son of God, as merely delegated, with an inferior kind of wor&s;hip, is ab&s;olute idolatry. When the fir&s;t be|gotten was brought into the world it was &s;aid, "Let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him," which they accordingly did at his birth. When he revealed him&s;elf to I&s;rael, the Father gave command, that "All men &s;hould honour the Son, even as they honoured the Father." That is with the &s;elf-&s;ame honour, as is paid to the Father, on the founda|tion of his being one (in e&s;&s;ence) with the Father. Where|as had the Father ordained divine honours, to be paid to any being of a different e&s;&s;ence from him&s;elf, he would not only have overturned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t commandment, "Thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me," but have given his glory to another, contrary to his own expre&s;s declaration.

The principal difference is this, The popi&s;h Juno, whom they call the mother of God, is far greater in power, and more exalted in glory, than the wife of Jupiter
<PB N="279" REF="027249_0277_0FD3ECF326A737C8">the pagan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> acted in all things &s;u|bordinate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> will of her hu&s;band, the king and father of the gods, who bore ab&s;olute &s;way over the heavenly &s;ynod: but the popi&s;h Jupiter acts in &s;ubordination to the will of his virgin mother. He rules the creation indeed; but then he is &s;till &s;ubject to maternal direction; &s;o that it is not God the &s;aviour of &s;inners, but the virgin Mary, the pop|i&s;h Juno, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ab&s;olute &s;overeignty, and what good they expect at the hand of God, is expected as to be done in obedience to his virgin mother.</P>
<P>In all other things there is little or no di&s;parity between the ancient and modern pantheon wor&s;hip. The pagans wor&s;hipped angels, whom they called gods, the papi&s;ts wor|&s;hip them al&s;o, knowing them to be creatures. The fir&s;t had their heroes and heroines whom they adored under the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">migods; the latter al&s;o have their heroes and heroines, whom they wor&s;hip under the name of &s;aints. The ancients had their ambiguous oracles and lying won|ders, and the moderns have both, in far greater abundance; &s;o that he mu&s;t be blind indeed, who does not &s;ee among&s;t them undi&s;gui&s;ed pagani&s;m.</P>

<P>I have &s;omewhere &s;een a map of that part of your dominions, brother, where the idolaters dwell; if you have got one about you, I &s;hould be glad to have a de&s;cription of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, &s;ir, and am glad it is in my power to gratify my much honoured brother.&mdash;You &s;ee, &s;ir, it is divided into two grand provinces, each inhabited by dif|ferent &s;ects of idol-wor&s;hippers. That province on the left contains the various &s;ects of civil idolaters, and this on the right contains the many denominations of their elder bre|thren, the religions idolaters. And I a&s;&s;ure you, they are two bodies of people very re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>The province which contains the civil idolaters, is di|vided into &s;everal counties, all of which are very populous. In the fir&s;t county live the wor&s;hippers of vain plea&s;ure,
<PB N="281" REF="027249_0279_0FD3ECF6BA8BCEE8">and this county is divided into &s;everal regalities, in which the &s;everal &s;ects or denominations of idolaters dwell, accond|ing to the diver&s;ity of their inclinations. The fir&s;t regality is appointed to the wor&s;hippers of living creatures. This &s;warms with jockies, and gamblers of the turf, both of no|ble and ignoble extraction. Along with them live the wor|&s;hippers of foxes, hares, and hounds, a very jolly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce, I a&s;&s;ure you, well &s;killed in the literature of the kennel. But it is better to be a &s;laye in a Turki&s;h galley, than held as a divinity in this regality, for adoration never fails to pro|cure torture to the idol; as the panting of the hare, and the well ploughed &s;ides of the hor&s;e &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate. A little nook of this regality is by royal mandate made over to &s;terile wives and maiden ladies, who for want of more agreeable objects of adoration, wor&s;hip monkies, parrors, and lap-dogs. The &s;econd regality is the habitation of tho&s;e who wor&s;hip the dramatic poets, and their apes the players. At the &s;hrines of tho&s;e idols, the wor&s;hippers &s;acrifice health and virtue, under pretence of learning wi&s;dom. They are very fa&s;hionable and honoured people, with whom legi&s;lators and guardians of public virtue are not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ociate. Here you may find legi&s;lators patriotically &s;acri|flcing their own virtue, in order to protect that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tion; their own e&s;tates, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">onemy; and faithle&s;sly wa&s;ting their own time, in order to teach indu&s;try to the inferior ranks of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd county, you will find all the wor&s;hippers of fal&s;e honour; a &s;et of gentry extremely divided in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;en|timents relative to the object of their adoration. One holy father falls down pro&s;trate, like Cardinal Wol&s;ey, before the triple crown and pontifical dignity. A &s;econd is equal|ly devout at the &s;hrine of a cardinal's hat; and a third, le&s;s a&s;piring, pays his devotions to a bi&s;hop's mitre or prelatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abes, and the highe&s;t of his pre&s;ent ambition is a bi&s;hopric.
<PB N="282" REF="027249_0280_0FD3ED13A6A48C30">Other reverend gentlemen offer a more humble wor&s;hip to a dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, prebend, or vicarage.</P>
<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that in this county people never wor&s;hip that to which they have already attained; but hav|ing compa&s;&s;ed their purpo&s;e, burn incen&s;e to the idol next in rank, and thus the wor&s;hipper goes on, if death and di&s;ap|pointment do not prevent him, till he has wor&s;hipped every &s;hrine in the pantheon.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, whil&s;t a curate, a vicarage is the idol; the vicarage obtained, it gives place to a prehend or deanry; which once enjoyed, they al&s;o in their turn give place to a hi&s;hopric; that to an archbi&s;hopric, which is the principal idol of the Engli&s;h. But in other countries there are idols of &s;uperior rank, &s;o that the moment an archbi&s;hopric is ob|rained, incen&s;e &s;mokes to a cardinal's hat; which al&s;o ob|tained, lo&s;es its wor&s;hipper, who is now converted to the wor&s;hip of the triple crown, the great god and father of all the other idols.</P>
<P>Nor are the laity le&s;s devout than their reverend brethren, for one man wor&s;hips univer&s;al empire, like Lewis of France and &s;ome others; but it is &s;aid that George of Britain is an apo&s;tate from this religion. Another wor&s;hips a crown and &s;ceptre, like the de&s;cendant of a certain bricklayer; and many adore the place of prime mini&s;ter, chancellor of the kingdom, fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, with every other place of honour and tru&s;t in government. Some you &s;hall &s;ee fall pro&s;trate before a &s;tar and garter, whil&s;t others are all obedience to a coroner. The hu&s;band lies in the du&s;t before "his honour," whil&s;t his wife in raptures adores "her lady&s;hip." His lord&s;hip is bended to by one, and another pays all his devo|tion to his grace.</P>
<P>In this country, you may find &s;ome men religious enough to wor&s;hip a corporal's knot, or a &s;erjeant's halberd. Some wor&s;hip an en&s;ign's fa&s;h, others a lieutenant's commi&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t the captain is ab&s;olutely as much devoted to a regiment, as his colonel is to a near&s;hal's &s;taff.</P>

The third county is the dwelling of tho&s;e who wor&s;hip their own bodies, than which, I pre&s;ume there is not a more ravenous idol in the &s;ynod. Around the &s;hrine of this god, &s;tand the baker, brewer, pa&s;try-cook, confectioner, di&s;tiller, weaver, and male and female taylors. Hard by are a con|&s;tellation of the &s;ofter &s;ex pro&s;trate before an Indian &s;hrub, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ves of which are in great veneration. At no great di&s;tance, are a cloud of wor&s;hippers of Virginia tobacco; they are divided into no le&s;s than four different &s;ects. The fir&s;t of whom wor&s;hips the tobacco in the neat leaf cut &s;mall, or well rolled together. The &s;econd wor&s;hip it, after it is well ground into flour. The third put it through the fire to the dear &s;en&s;ation. And the fourth are of &s;uch a eatholic di&s;po&s;ition, that they wor&s;hip the dearly beloved tobacco in all its forms. Of this &s;ect The LISTNER profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The belly is wor&s;hipped by many, as the principal god, and &s;o profu&s;e are they in their offerings, that its altar is &s;ometimes almo&s;t overturned, and the idol greedy as it is, is unable to bear the fruits of their devotion. The &s;ect of glut|tons, a very devout race, ran&s;ack both earth and &s;ea to bring plenty of offerings to the idol; and that of drunkards, in no le&s;s devotion, pour on the wines in &s;uch profu&s;ion, that all the &s;urrounding trenches are gorged to the brim. This &s;ame idol differs exceedingly from mo&s;t other objects of ido|latrous wor&s;hip; for when it has &s;willed to exce&s;s in the drink offering, it invites the brain to &s;hare in the fea&s;t, to which it pre&s;ents every vapouri&s;h effluvia, whil&s;t it re&s;erves for its own u&s;e only the parts excrementitous. Moreover, this &s;ame belly is apt to re&s;ent the profu&s;ion of its wor&s;hip|pers, and &s;ends forth the blue&s;t plagues, mo&s;t chilling agues, burning, putrid, and malignant fevers, with all manner of acute and chronical di&s;tempers among&s;t the wor&s;hippers, and thus provides employment for gentlemen of the faculty: who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, po&s;itively, would be wor&s;e than that of a co|bler, but for the religion of belly wor&s;hipping.</P>

<P>Had I time, I would give you a more full account of the religious idolaters; but as bu&s;ine&s;s is urgent, I &s;hall only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouch upon &s;ome of their gods.

This god who is exalted above all that is called god, i&s;&s;ueth di&s;pen|&s;ations and pardons, for money and price, contrary to the manner of the God of heaven. The one pardons and gives &s;alvation freely of grace, but the other &s;ells his pardons as dear as he can. Next to his holine&s;s, on the right hand, &s;tands the popi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uno, or virgin Mary, who&s;e powerful command of the God of nature, is greatly adored by every zealous papi&s;t. On the left hand &s;tands a Je&s;us Chri&s;t of wood, whom the papi&s;ts al&s;o highly revere; for they are almo&s;t to di&s;traction, fond of wooden Deities. Some indeed have a Je&s;us Chri&s;t made of gold or &s;ilver, and others more lowly, wor&s;hip a paper Saviour; but the mo&s;t humble devo|tion is paid to the gods which the baker makes. The&s;e are the mo&s;t ravenous idolaters in the whole world, for with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s, and devout veneration they eat the ob|ject of their adoration.

<P>I have &s;ometimes thought, brother, that the po|pi&s;h religion is the religion of Molech inverted. That vo|racious idol was u&s;ed to devour the children of his wor&s;hip|pers; but here the greedy wor&s;hippers devour their god af|ter he is well baked in an oven.</P>

<P>The ancient pagans were even fooli&s;h enough, in giving their children to that greedy devil, Molech; and the papi&s;ts are not much wi&s;er in wor&s;hipping the works of the artificer, or believing that they can eat their maker. Here are likewi&s;e the greate&s;t variety of venerable relicks, &s;uch as St. Peter's beard, the ear of St. Francis, the milk of the virgin, with a thou&s;and fooleries be&s;ides, all of which are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e deified.</P>

<P>That will be very grateful to me, cou&s;in Avaro, as your fordid and griping influences, have the mo&s;t happy effect upon the reign of contention.

Your &s;laves dare not think of dying and entering into another world, there|fore it &s;ometimes happens, that after the muckworm has been by every means, and every kind of rapine, &s;craping wealth together for many years, he drops into eternity with|out leaving behind him any authentic direction how his plun|der is to be di&s;po&s;ed of.

<P>Sometimes the griping mi&s;er, that enemy to him&s;elf and all mankind, is over per&s;uaded to make his will, though &s;e|cretly hoping, he &s;hall not die for a great while yet to come; and then the ca&s;e is very little altered: for when the wretch goes to the place appointed for the covetous, his will is very

I have laid my claim to the popi&s;h clergy in general, but of them all, there are none who exceed the worthy lords the inqui&s;itors in veneration of my golden image.

The merchant is apprehend|ed, his e&s;tate confi&s;cated; he is immured in the pri&s;on cells, till con&s;umed either by famine or vermin, otherwi&s;e he is tortured privately to death, by the hands of their &s;anctified ruffians.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of the many which I might produce, &s;hall &s;erve to exemplify the equity of the inqui&s;itors. When Sy|racu&s;e was in its glory, there was one Bellarius, a foreign merchant, who in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, had ama&s;&s;ed great riches; and who, at the &s;ame time, was &s;o circum&s;pect in all his ways, that even the eye of an emi&s;&s;ary of the office, could find nothing, of which to accu&s;e him to the tribunal. Thus he lived in reputation and affluence for many years, to the great impatience of the holy inqui&s;itors, who could find no plau&s;able pretence, by which they might fang his &s;ub&s;tance with their rapacious talons.</P>
<P>Bellarius had an only child, a lady about &s;eventeen. Her per&s;on was the perfection of &s;ymmetry, and her mind a copy of the pure&s;t virtue. By her they found means to accom|pli&s;h their purpo&s;es, and bring complicated ruin on the un|happy parent. The family retired to peaceful repo&s;e, were one night alarmed about one in the morning, fir&s;t by the ap|proach of a coach, and then by a &s;mart rapping at the gate. Bellarius from within a&s;ked, "Who is there?"

<P>Well, brother, I find then the prie&s;ts of Rome are not &s;o much addicted to eunuchry as they pretend. 'Tis lawful, it &s;eems, to ravi&s;h virgins, however unlawful it may be to have a married wife. I have often heard of the &s;eraglio of princes, but not &s;o often of the &s;eraglio of prie&s;ts, and tho&s;e prie&s;ts too, who of all others are the mo&s;t zealous wonderers after the &s;even headed bea&s;t.</P>

<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and comfortle&s;s Bellarius remained at home; for&s;ook all company, and conver&s;ed only with the various cogitations of his own foreboding mind. At one time he conjectured that his haple&s;s daughter, in &s;ome inadver|tent moment, might have bla&s;phemed other the wooden virgin Mary or the great high prie&s;t of Rome, or the holy inqui&s;itors, in which ca&s;e he gave her up for lo&s;t, and doom|ed her to fall a &s;acrifice. Yet could he &s;carcely forgive the rigour of that religion, which had in &s;uch a mercile&s;s man|ner ravi&s;hed her from his fond embrace.</P>
<P>It was not long after this an Armenian merchant, &s;aid to be newly arrived in Syracu&s;e, called on him, under pretence of buying a large a&s;&s;ortment of goods. Generous and un&s;u&s;|pecting Bellarius, bid him welcome to his hou&s;e during his &s;tay; which he after &s;ome &s;eemingly mode&s;t apologies thank|fully accepted. The pretended Armenian perceiving Bella|rius to eat but little at &s;upper, now and then inadvertently to &s;lip a &s;igh, took occa&s;ion to rally him in a friendly man|ner, as if troubled with the hyp', advi&s;ed him to cheer up and hope for better times.</P>
<P>Bellarius having but little reli&s;h for a je&s;t, &s;eriou&s;ly re|plied, "No, &s;ir, the hyp' is not my pre&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e, neither
<PB N="290" REF="027249_0288_0FD3ED1AE6729B08">have my affairs in trade taken an adver&s;e turn; and yet there is one thing, which gives me great di&s;tre&s;s." The friendly Armenian was now more importunate to know his grievance, that he might at lea&s;t &s;ympathize with him in his affliction. Little &s;u&s;pecting that he was conflicting with prie&s;tly &s;ubtilty, he thought he might &s;afely lodge his cir|cum&s;tances in the generous bo&s;om of a merchant; he repli|ed, &s;ir, I &s;uppo&s;e you are a &s;tranger in Syracu&s;e; as &s;uch let me advi&s;e you, as you value your life and liberty, to be careful of your words, and every part of your deportment during your abode, for this is a place of danger. I have, &s;ir, one only daughter, the perfect image of her lovely mother, whom I had the mi&s;ery to bury but a few months ago. I know not by what temptation, but my poor girl has &s;aid &s;omething di&s;honourable either of the lady of Loretto, his holine&s;s the pope, or their lord&s;hips the Inqui&s;itors, for which &s;he is impri&s;oned in the holy office, and I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t an&s;wer it with her life.</P>
<P>Oh, &s;ir, I hope not, &s;aid the Armenian, the lady's youth will interceed for her, and after &s;ome gentle admonition, your daughter will be returned to the hou&s;e of her father.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;ir! rejoined di&s;con&s;olate Bellarius, I cannot but &s;ear, that her youth and beauty are the greate&s;t enemies and accu&s;ers. The&s;e are qualities capable of impre&s;&s;ing the heart even of an inqui&s;itor. If this is the ca&s;e, my poor daughter is already either dead or debauched. Or &s;hould it happen, that any thing has been alledged again&s;t her religi|ous conduct, there are in&s;truments enow in the Inqui&s;ition, and their lord&s;hips want not &s;kill to u&s;e them; in&s;truments &s;ufficient to make an helple&s;s virgin confe&s;s that, which even never entered her thoughts: &s;o that at all events, her death or di&s;honour is en&s;ured. No, &s;ir, it is not po&s;&s;ible for me to hope for better, &s;eeing the lea&s;t hint thrown out again&s;t the Inqui&s;ition, is condemned as unpardonable bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>It was not long after this di&s;cour&s;e, before the Armeni|an feigned a nece&s;&s;ity of going out; went &s;traight to the In|qui&s;ition
<PB N="291" REF="027249_0289_0FD3ECFD44286078">and made information, being a je&s;uit di&s;gui&s;ed as a merchant, and that very night a coach was &s;ent to con|duct Bellarius to the cells of their dreadful pri&s;on. Next day his effects were &s;eized by order of the holy fathers, who now rejoiced that at la&s;t they had gra&s;ped the long wi&s;hed for prey. Confined in an abominable cell, he was greatly annoyed by vermin; and being divers times examined by torture, he died with grief for his daughter, who, as &s;he could never freely yield to the loath&s;ome embrace of tho&s;e murderers, in a few months tired their patience. Then one of the &s;anctified ruffians, fir&s;t murdered her, and then burned her to a&s;hes in the dry pan.

<P>I did &s;o, &s;ir, and &s;hall be ready farther to oblige you, if to give you a brief view of our corporation which like all other towns corporate, con&s;i&s;ts of divers companies, will do it. The fir&s;t of which is that of</P>
<P>The lawyers. A very wi&s;e &s;et of gentlemen; who ex|ceed the children of light in the art of money-getting, as far as any of the inhabitants of our territories; of cour&s;e they are held in great e&s;timation, as gentlemen of the fir&s;t intelli|gence. In our city of Avarice, there is no knowledge deem|ed of any avail; no conduct accounted virtuous be&s;ides that of money getting. He is always the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t

There was a time you know, when the law was as &s;traight, as clear, as a beam of light, and needed no expounding, &s;o that every man was his own coun&s;ellor. But ever &s;ince the kings of England were kept pri&s;oners under a guard, le&s;t truth &s;hould become familiar to the royal ear, the ca&s;e has been quite altered; now it is &s;o full of pleas and demurrers, doubts and excep|tions, &amp;c. that it is a perfect labyrinth; dangerous for an ho|ne&s;t man to enter. For in the lawyers company it is a &s;tand|ing rule, that, whether the plaintiff or defendent lo&s;e the cau&s;e, the lawyers on both &s;ides are &s;ure to be con&s;iderable gainers. Indeed, it is very &s;eldom, but they manage the matter &s;o, that all parties except them&s;elves are lo&s;ers, and if he who gains the trial, finds him&s;elf in the end to be a lo|&s;er, how do you think it mu&s;t fare with the wretch, again&s;t whom the verdict is given? If an houe&s;t man has a mind to purcha&s;e an e&s;tate ever &s;o fairly, and pay for it ever &s;o ho|ne&s;tly, he will find it a difficult matter, &s;o to &s;ecure his title, but if any &s;ucceeding heir be bred to the law; or heire&s;s be married to a lawyer, he may run a ri&s;k of being jo&s;tled out of his property, by &s;ome knavi&s;h quirk in law, without any al|lowance made either for the e&s;tate or its improvements.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">may be &s;aid of my faithful di&s;ciples, the law|yers, attornies, bailiffs, &amp;c. that they pay as little regard to truth as the greate&s;t of our&s;elves.

<P>Contumelius was a York&s;hire gentleman, of di&s;tingui&s;hed birth and ample fortune, but &s;omewhat akin to the mad Ma|cedonian. His country-&s;eat &s;tood by the &s;ide of a lane, through which neighbouring farmers pa&s;&s;ed with their teams for time immemorial. But &s;o much pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, of the whi&s;tling clowns following their waggous, at la&s;t proved
<PB N="293" REF="027249_0291_0FD3ED0025E98930">very offen&s;ive to the wor&s;hipful 'Squire, &s;o that he re&s;olved to remove the intolerable nui&s;ance by blocking up the way. A gate was accordingly put up, and fa&s;tened with a padlock, effectually to &s;top the clowni&s;h pa&s;&s;engers from pa&s;&s;ing as be|fore, and turn them by a way con&s;iderably more di&s;tant.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the 'Squire's proceedings reached the ear of Mr. Loveright, a neighbouring farmer, he ordered his wag|gon to drive directly to the gate, and finding it lock'd, took an axe, which he had brought with him for that purpo&s;e, and to the great mortification of 'Squire Contumelius hewed it to pieces. His wor&s;hip in a rage po&s;ted to Mr. Deceitful, a ve|ry eminent lawyer in the neighbouring town, for his advice. The worthy lawyer, finding this a proper occa&s;ion of &s;erv|ing his own intere&s;t, advi&s;ed the 'Squire to &s;end for a writ, commence an auction again&s;t the farmer for his intolerable in|&s;olence. In a few days the writ was &s;erved on Loveright, who immediately waited on lawyer Deceitful, in order if po&s;&s;ible to compromi&s;e the matter.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner entered the office, than Mr. Deceitful took him a&s;ide and thus addre&s;&s;ed him, "I am heartily &s;orry, my good Mr. Loveright, that I have been in a manner obliged, by his wor&s;hip Contumelius, to &s;end for a writ again&s;t you. But I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, in my opinion your &s;ide of the que&s;|tion is by much the &s;afe&s;t, and might I advi&s;e you, it would be to &s;tand a trial, and by no means &s;ubmit to a compromi&s;e. Knowing the farmer to be a man of &s;ub&s;tance and re&s;olution, continued he, there is no bearing with &s;uch an in&s;olent treat|ment. For my own part, Mr. Loveright, I would much ra|ther you had been my client, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, than the giddy 'Squire, but he fir&s;t applied to me and in&s;i&s;ted on my doing what I have done. If you plea&s;e you may apply to my brother Fal&s;hood, who is &s;kilful as any man, and as hone&s;t as any lawyer I know. In the mean while, &s;ir, you may depend on me as your real friend, ready to &s;erve you in e|very thing con&s;i&s;tent with my reputation."</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="027249_0292_0FD3ED1E8095E700">
As &s;oon as Loveright was departed, Mr. Deceitful took hor&s;e, and rode directly to the 'Squire's hou&s;e; told him the farmer had been with him, heartily repented of his folly, and was very de&s;irous of coming to terms of agreement. But were the ca&s;e mine, &s;aid he, I would li&s;ten to no terms of ac|commodation, but puni&s;h his in&s;olence to the utmo&s;t rigour of law. The low-life fellow, having got forward in the world, has forgotten him&s;elf; and if &s;uffered now to e&s;cape with impunity, he will be the pe&s;t of the neighbourhood. Thus the worthy lawyer irritated both parties, till he had made &s;ure of an a&s;&s;ize hearing, that, in the debate, he might likewi&s;e in&s;ure to him&s;elf a &s;um very con&s;iderable. For he knew very well, that if ever a difference falls into the infa|tiable maw of the court, it will never be di&s;gorged till all co&s;ts of &s;uit are amply paid off; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for my mercenary &s;cribblers to give any credit. Let them act ju&s;t|ly or unju&s;tly, they make &s;ure of their fees; and as the one party mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;e, both coun&s;ellor and attorney, take care to father the mi&s;carriage of the cau&s;e, on &s;omething which the client has done, which he ought not; or omit|ted, which he ought to have done: and not with&s;tanding all their fraud and deceit, both of them come off good hone&s;t lawyers.

Others, for want of friends, are obliged much again&s;t their inclination to continue underlings all the length of a tedious life.

Many indeed think they &s;hould be quite contented, if they had but one more benefice added to what they now enjoy; but I can tell you, could they come by another, there would &s;till be another wanting. It is much, now &s;o many clergymen find them&s;elves unea&s;y in the trammels, if they do not at la&s;t take it into their heads to per&s;uade the legi&s;lature, that a clergyman cannot preach in three or four churches at one and the &s;ame time.

I hear many clergymen of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, in entering upon the &s;ervice, thus addre&s;s the maje&s;ty of heaven, "Lord clean&s;e thou the thoughts of our hearts, by the in&s;piration of the Holy Spirit;" and in le&s;s than an hour after, telling their pari&s;hioners, that it is mere enthu&s;i|a&s;m in any man to expect in the&s;e days, to be at all influen|ced by the in&s;piration of the Holy Spirit.</P>

<P>It is very diverting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear my par&s;ons boa&s;ting of their &s;uperior knowledge, even when by their mini&s;trations it is plain, that they are acquainted with almo&s;t any writings, better than tho&s;e of in&s;piration; when their auditories dwin|dle away to nothing, and the few people who abide by them are de&s;titute of all religion.

<P>III. The next company in our corporation is that of the &s;training landlords, a very noble and reputable company, indeed; notwith&s;tanding, they are far from being opulent. In the days of yore, when luxary was but little in vogue, the frecholders were attended with fewer wants, and of cour&s;e this company was le&s;s flouri&s;hing; but &s;ince the&s;e happy days commenced, in which people of quality are trained up in ab&s;olute idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation; in which vir|tue
<PB N="301" REF="027249_0299_0FD3CDA6AC0FE458">is of no account, and luxury, pride, and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, are arrrived at their zenith; the people of quality are amaz|ingly poor, and are attended with an unde&s;cribable train of nece&s;&s;ities. What is very remarkable, their pride has grown in a perfect proportion to their poverty, &s;o that now it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed law among&s;t them, to look upon them&s;elves as of a different blood from the re&s;t of mankind. Indeed you can|not affront a per&s;on of quality wor&s;e, than by like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing him to one of tho&s;e, who are called vulgar creatures; notwith|&s;tanding, by the way, it is tho&s;e &s;ame vulgar creatures which enable per&s;ons of rank and fa&s;hion to &s;upport the dignity of their &s;tation; and were there no vulgar creatures, there would al&s;o be no ladies of quality.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction which the quality pay to them&s;elves, is of the utmo&s;t u&s;e in my admini&s;tration, as will appear from the following &s;tory.</P>
<P>I went one day to the hou&s;e of Sir Fop Mortalis, a very famous gentleman in the country, with a de&s;ign to pay my devoirs to madam Mortalis, his lady; a gentlewoman who abhors to have the lea&s;t compari&s;on made, betwixt her and any per&s;on whatever of inferior rank. The chambermaid informed her mi&s;tre&s;s, that good Mr. Prudence waited be|low, de&s;iring to &s;peak with her lady&s;hip, if convenient; the lady &s;oon de&s;cended, and compliments pa&s;&s;ed on either &s;ide, &s;he conducted me into her parlour, where &s;he and I had the following dialogue.</P>

<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Mr. Prudence, you have been a very great &s;tranger! It is now many months &s;ince I &s;aw you at our hou&s;e; but I am glad to &s;ee you now, and I wi&s;h in my heart Sir Fop Mortalis had been at home.</P>

<P>Urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, madam, demands my at|tendance &s;o much el&s;ewhere, that I cannot &s;o frequently as I could wi&s;h, pay my re&s;pects to Sir Fop and my lady Mor|talis. But now, madam, I am come, if po&s;&s;ible to rectify a growing mi&s;take among&s;t mankind; and mu&s;t tell your

Indeed, my lady, it is become a very difficult matter, in a concour&s;e of people, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the farmers and trade&s;mens wives, and ladies of birth and fortune; nor can we more ca&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;h between their &s;everal children. Why, madam, the farmers and trade&s;mens children are all ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es; young gentlemen and ladies now-a-days. I know not, for my part, what the world will come to, if &s;ome mea&s;ures are not &s;peedily taken to prevent the confounding of ba&s;ene&s;s with dignity.</P>
<P>When I was la&s;t at church, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, as I thought, mi&s;s Mortalis, your daughter, there; well know|ing that neither Sir Fop him&s;elf, nor any of his family, go often to any place of public wor&s;hip.

<P>I know it, my lady, I know it, and am mightily plea&s;ed with your determination.

Do you think, &s;ir, that any body has been daring enough to tell her that &s;he real|ly is a mortal?" To which the plain countryman, in his own clowni&s;h way, replied, "Mi&s;s Mortalis at church, quoth-a&mdash; no, no, &s;ir, you are quite mi&s;taken, for Sir Fop's family are people of quality, and therefore meddle none with religion. What &s;hould they do at church, &s;eeing they fear no hell, re|gard not God, and believe not in the devil; as for heaven, Sir Fop is willing to leave that to the poor, and de&s;ires no great|er happine&s;s for him&s;elf and his, than is implied in an earl|dom."</P>

<P>But, &s;aid I to the fellow pray who is that young lady whom I took for Mi&s;s Mortalis? Poh, lady quoth a&mdash;why 'tis John Tillground's daughter, o'the Five Elms. Tillground's daughter! &s;aid I, you &s;urprize me; &s;he is as finely dre&s;t, as I have &s;een Mi&s;s Mortalis, when going to a ball. And pray, continued I, who is yonder lady, with the French head-dre&s;s and furred cardi|nal? I thought you had had no people of quality in this pa|ri&s;h, be&s;ides Sir Fop's family. No, &s;ir, returned he, we have none who are &s;uch by birth, but we have many who are quality by their dre&s;s. The lady, &s;ir, that you enquire after is Mrs. Wat&s;on, the landlady at the Three Tuns.</P>
<P>Well, madam, I followed them out of church, and was amazed to &s;ee the plattings of hair, the tires of ruffles, and the labyrinthian furbeloes with which the women were de|corated.

<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is only one way that I know of, madam, and that is to rai&s;e their rents to the uttermo&s;t. As every lea&s;e expires, it will be an ea&s;y matter for Sir Fop, in the renewal of it, to advance the rent as high as he plea&s;es. The &s;laves dare not go away; and if they &s;hould, there will be others fooli&s;h enough, to agree to any t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rms, rather than mi&s;s of a farm.

This &s;cheme will certainly conquer the ambition of the farmers; but what will it do for the trade&s;men, good Mr. Prudence; they will &s;till continue an eye-&s;ore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, the &s;ame &s;cheme will produce very humbling effects, upon trade&s;men of every kind; though I dare not a&s;&s;ert, that you will ever be able perfectly to &s;ubject to your ambition and avarice, that honourable body of merchants, whom you affectedly call cits. No, madam, I am afraid that nobility it&s;elf mu&s;t give place to the public &s;pirit of the merchant; yet even them you may greatly in|jure, and prevent their being of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to their country, as otherwi&s;e they might be. But as to in|land trade, by racking your tenants in the manner pre|&s;cribed, you may ab&s;olutely de&s;troy it. That you may &s;ee the utility of my &s;cheme, I &s;hall a little explain it to your lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>If the farmers are racked to the utmo&s;t, they will be obliged to &s;ell the produce of their lands at an exhorbitant price, otherwi&s;e it will be altogether out of their power to pay the &s;tipulated rent. And be&s;ides &s;elling their crops, &amp;c. for an advanced price, they will be obliged to abridge the wages of all their labourers, &s;miths, carpenters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the farmer will find it very difficult to live, and of cour&s;e will rarely vi&s;it the mercer's and drap|er's &s;hops; and as for his labourers and workmen, they will find but little money to lay out in cloaths; e&s;pecially if their children be numerous, as the demands of the back mu&s;t always give place to the louder calls of the belly. And
<PB N="306" REF="027249_0304_0FD3EDA42063B3C8">as you know, my lady, &s;terility very rarely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wells in the labourer's cuttage: it is unknown what mi&s;ery you may happily introduce among&s;t them, by the &s;cheme propo&s;ed. The draper's goods, will lie upon his hands, unle&s;s indeed he is plea&s;ed to give credit to the poor; if the former, he will be &s;paring of his orders; and if the latter, we &s;hall &s;oon have him a bankrupt, &s;o that he will be effectually ru|ined.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, madam, that here we affect the manufacturer, equally with the farmer and &s;hopkeeper; for when the re|tail trade is ruined by the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, the mana|facturer will find little call for his goods; the i&s;&s;ue of which will be, the di&s;banding of many of his journeymen, and abridging the wages of the re&s;t. The di&s;banded journey|men being incapable of finding employment, and not hav|ing learned the art of living like the camelion, on the air, will be drove to thieving, by which means America will be peopled, and Tyburn Chronicle rendered re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>As to the manufacturer him&s;elf, his capital being &s;oon converted into manufactured goods, he will be obliged to &s;ell them under their value, that he may keep up his credit with the merchant, and be able to carry on a little trade, vainly hoping that times may alter for the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir, your &s;cheme is very fea&s;ible, and yet there is one thing that will put the manufacturer ab&s;o|lutely out of our power. I mean, &s;ir, the exportation of their manufacture. I don't know how it is, but the&s;e cits of merchants can &s;end goods any where, and they, &s;ir, will &s;upport the manufacturer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, I a&s;&s;ure you, my &s;cheme, if cor|dially adopted, and executed with vigour, will put it ab&s;o|&s;olutely out of the merchant's power. There is nothing can recommend the Engli&s;h manufacture at a foreign mar|ket, but the price being inferior to that of other nations. Now, if an Engli&s;hman mu&s;t pay twice as dear for his pro|vi&s;ion in his own country, as a Frenchman does in his, it
<PB N="307" REF="027249_0305_0FD3ED81837354D0">is ea&s;y to &s;ee that either journeymen's wages mu&s;t in En|gland be double to what they are in France, or the jour|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">men mu&s;t &s;tarve; which few Engli&s;hmen are fond of doing.

Thus, madam, I have pointed out a method by which, you people of fa&s;hion, in order to &s;upport your own grandeur, may &s;uck the blood of all inferior ranks of people, and make the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects ab&s;olutely &s;laves, even in a country which boa&s;ts its free|dom.

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are, what country people call a reading &s;ociety, into which we had formed our&s;elves &s;ome years before the fir&s;t Review made its public appearance. We had not long ta|ken in books, before we found &s;everal articles of our pur|cha&s;e to be &s;tolen from other authors; and but very few of our titular authors, had either honour or hone&s;ty enough, to inform the public from what &s;ources they compiled their volumes. We would advi&s;e all writers to live upon their own proper genius, deeming it pity that pilferers &s;hould be &s;uf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered in the republic of letters. At the la&s;t meeting of our club, this que&s;tion was put and canva&s;&s;ed, "What can induce one writer to &s;teal from another?"</P>
<P>To this important que&s;tion, one replied one thing, and another &s;aid what he could to confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it, as every member was willing to di&s;play his abilities; at la&s;t, Dick Keene, a te&s;ty kind of youth, but of good &s;en&s;e, gave us the following &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"Very probably, &s;aid ma&s;ter Dick, &s;ome authors may &s;teal from others for the &s;ame rea&s;on which that celebrat|ed

Therefore, what frugal nature, and Gamaliel hath with|held, mu&s;t be &s;upplied by indu&s;trious freedom; and as the end propo&s;ed mu&s;t at all events be obtained, honour, truth, and hone&s;ty, &s;moke at once on the altar of ambition. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rk goes the writer, plunders every volume in his own and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> patron's library, at la&s;t compleats his &s;cheme; and lo! we have an entire new work, by the learned Mr. Dunce. And &s;o it comes to pa&s;s, that we the hone&s;t purcha&s;ers, pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce or four times over for the &s;ame matter and, perhaps in almo&s;t the &s;ame manner likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>There are others, who, as a ju&s;t judgment on their for|mer indolence and extravagance, are now condemned to live upon their wit; which being dull and tardy, &s;omewhat a-kin to the brain of an a&s;s, of it&s;elf can afford but a very penurious table, and uncomfortable lodging. Bitten with hunger, the unhappy man is obliged to &s;teal where he can, and then to &s;ell his ill-gotten collection to the book&s;eller, in order to procure a good holiday dinner. The book&s;eller, I believe, is pretty well convinced of the truth of my re|marks, as he has paid &s;mart for his connection with litera|ry thieves.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e two kinds of pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erers, in my humble opinion, the latter is by far the mo&s;t excu&s;able.

To which Dick replied,</P>
<P>"That many ancient writings, are truly worthy of be|ing introduced to public view; I am &s;o far from denying, that, I &s;hould deem it truly laudable for any gentleman of capacity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ure, to draw forth the remains of antiquity from the cells of ob&s;curity, and &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t to vote him the mo&s;t public thanks. But I would have it done in &s;uch a manner, as to come within the reach of the mid|dle cla&s;s of people, among&s;t whom the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k of all &s;orts of readers are found. Moreover, I would have all writings on religious &s;ubjects &s;o contrived, as to come within the reach of the poor, for who el&s;e give them&s;elves any troable about religion, or have any plea&s;ure in &s;erious writings? If a com|mentary on the Bible mu&s;t go beyond the extent of their fi|nances, it might as well be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ked up in Pool's Synop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is, where it was before the commentary was written.

<P><PB N="312" REF="027249_0310_0FD3EDA8A2421888">
Here he concluded, and we were &s;oon convinced, that there was much weight in his rea&s;oning. We mu&s;t beg leave to tell you, gentlemen, that when your wor&s;hips erect|ed your tribunal, and every author was &s;ummoned to ap|pear before you, we flattered a hope, that all pilferers would have fled out of the republic of letters. But, alas! we have been hitherto di&s;appointed, and in reality, they &s;eem to be on the increa&s;e, &s;o that a man can hardly claim per&s;onal right to a &s;ingle idea, how ju&s;tly &s;oever it may be his property.</P>
<P>We earne&s;tly beg that you, gentlemen, will be obliging enough to publi&s;h your aver&s;ion to this craft; to command all, who are de&s;titute both of fortune and genius, to recon|cile them&s;elves to their de&s;tiny, and &s;hew their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the higher power, by learning &s;ome handicraft bu&s;ine&s;s, by which they may gain an hone&s;t living. There are a thou&s;and ways to live in the world, if that of an author were to cea&s;e. For in&s;tance, there is carrying a mu&s;ket, or beating a drum by land, and furling the &s;ails by &s;ea, ei|ther of which are honourable employments, when compar|ed with that of book-&s;tealing.</P>
<P>As we know not to whom we can apply, with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s, but to your&s;elves; we mu&s;t farther beg, that you will not only detect the theft, when you meet with it, but do as the worthy inhabitants of St. Giles's do on &s;imilar occa|&s;ions, that is, pur&s;ue the delinquent with a &s;top-thief, &s;top|thief. Indeed, gentlemen, it will not le&s;&s;en you in the pub|lic e&s;teem, &s;hould you commence even literary thief catchers. Should it plea&s;e you to comply with our reque&s;t, we doubt not but the &s;treets which lead to places of public re&s;ort, will in a few years be lined with many authors, having a&s;&s;umed the more honourable employment of a beggar.</P>
<P>Thus the impo&s;ts would be taken off from the &s;tudious; real authors would pre&s;erve their honour, no one daring to invade their right, for fear of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to public infamy. Perhaps that mo&s;t villainous of all practices may

<P>Indeed, cou&s;in, I think the reque&s;t of that &s;ociety rea&s;onable enough, and ought to be granted; for as the world now goes, it is a difficult matter for a man to know to whom he is obliged for any profitable hint he meets with in the cour&s;e of his reading. And flim&s;y as modern productions in general are, there is now and then a profitable hint to be met with. But when any thing of a recommendatory qua|lity happens to emerge from the teem-pre&s;s; the whole race of catch-penny imitators, &s;warm about it, and gobble it up, then &s;pue it out, as if it were their own. However, cou&s;in, it mu&s;t be owned, there are &s;ome of your mercenary &s;cribblers who are much more honourable than others, and let the public know, that what they write is not the fruit of their own genius, but is borrowed from this or that re&s;pocta|ble author, under pretence of making it more public, on ac|count of its great excellency. They de&s;ire not to rob the author of his honour: all they deem nece&s;&s;ary, is a loan of his genius to &s;upply the defects of their own, and to help them a little forward in the world.</P>
<P>But of all writers, commend me to polemic divines. Oh! it would be a plea&s;ure to the devil him&s;elf, to &s;ee with what dexterity they put off their own anger, under the name of zeal for God; ju&s;t as the indu&s;trious trade&s;men of Bir|mingham
<PB N="314" REF="027249_0312_0FD3EDAC61699AA8">do their manufacture for the coin of the nation. 'Tis amazing to think, how pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;tant mini&s;ters can lugg in the Almighty into both &s;ides of their quarrel; and how they would make the world believe, that their cau&s;e is the cau&s;e of heaven, and that they have got authority to di&s;pen&s;e the cur&s;es of the Mo&s;t High. Nothing can be more plea&s;ing, than to &s;ee men of wi&s;dom and religion, vigorou&s;ly contend|ing for their own honour, and at the &s;ame time making the public believe, they have nothing in view but the Redeemer's glory. And I a&s;&s;ure you it is not every divine, even of great parts, who takes time to di&s;tingui&s;h between the glory of God, and his own reputation.</P>
<P>Next to this, I am delighted to &s;ee men of learning and religion, bickering each other about &s;ubjects, which the greate&s;t of all the apo&s;tles would not pre&s;ume to pry into. But we have divines &s;o expert, that they under&s;tand what never was revealed; and &s;o zealous, that they will oblige others to have the &s;ame degree of intelligence with them|&s;elves, under pain of their implacable di&s;plea&s;ure; and yet they are the true mini&s;ters of the meek and loving Saviour. But a very few are to be met with who have humility e|nough to &s;ubmit to the &s;implicity of &s;cripture.

<P>No, gentlemen, I do not mean, neither all the book&s;ellers nor printers.

Be&s;ides, there are others, who will &s;ell both &s;oul and body to the father of lies, in de|fence of &s;ome particular &s;tate; and others to ruin &s;ome pub|lic character. The celebrated Mr. Maubert of Bru&s;&s;els is a great man in this way.</P>
<P>Free of this company, are another &s;et of men, implaca|ble enemies to hone&s;t indu&s;try, who live altogether by their wit; appear in all &s;hapes and characters, and &s;tick at no|thing to get money.

<P>I think you mu&s;t be mi&s;taken now, cou&s;in, for the end of all theatrical entertainments, which I perceive you have in view, is the expo&s;ing of vice and reformation of manners; con&s;equently their de&s;ign was originally religi|ous.</P>

<P>I allow, that in the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, the ancients had a religious de&s;ign, in exhibitions of the &s;tage; but what of that? They had likewi&s;e a religious de&s;ign, in
<PB N="316" REF="027249_0314_0FD3EDAEC78049C0">pa&s;&s;ing their children through the fire to the devil Molech. I allow, farther, that in the days of monki&s;h ignorance, tho&s;e blinking prie&s;ts, made u&s;e of the &s;tage to convey their in&s;tructions; but then it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;ame fathers were equally pious, and devout in per&s;ecuting the be&s;t of men. So then, cou&s;in, the one is as much au|thori&s;ed by ancient practice as the other. Indeed when you con&s;ider, that the &s;tage is peopled by extravagant, &s;pend-thrift gentlemen, broken trade&s;men, lazy mechanics, who are always avowed enemies to moral integrity; they will appear to be a very unpromi&s;ing race of reformers.</P>
<P>Should you follow them from the &s;tage to their lodgings, and trace their &s;teps through the lanes of private life, you would &s;oon be convinced, that Sir John Fielding's runners bid much more fair than they, for reforming the manners of the people.

<P>You mu&s;t know, Leonora and Matilda have been intimate from their infancy, and as &s;uch continued their friend&s;hip even to mature life; but when both became wives and mothers, I taught them to behave more incon&s;i&s;tently than they did when they were children. Matilda being quite fatigued with dome&s;tic concerns, an attention to which her mind is not very happily turned, re&s;olved one day to &s;pend the afternoon with her friend Leonora. When &s;he went, &s;he found her exceedingly depre&s;t and hy&s;terical, by no means in a talkative humour; a circum&s;tance which frequently hap|pens to the ladies of middle rank, over &s;ince luxury and idle|ne&s;s became &s;o prevalent among&s;t them.</P>

<P>True, &s;ir, but the matter did not end here. Poor Matilda, being unable to bear the conceived &s;light, made free to call on Letitia on her way home, that &s;he might give a lit|tle vent to her turbulent pa&s;&s;ions. Letitia, being as de&s;titute of innate ideas as &s;he is of fidelity, readily li&s;tened to the plaintive account, how Matilda had been &s;erved; without he&s;itation approved her departure, kindly fanned the flame of re&s;entment, and at la&s;t advi&s;ed her to let Leonora come to her&s;elf when &s;he &s;hould find it convenient.</P>
<P>Matilda had not been long gone, before Letitia, who burned with impatience to have a little Tittle-tattle, went to Leonora, and &s;et mi&s;chief abroach with her al&s;o. She told her all the former had &s;aid of her, and happily gave it &s;uch a turn, as to render it very offen&s;ive, notwith&s;tanding &s;he kept &s;trictly to the letter of truth. Some people are re|markably happy in talents of this kind; by their manner of repre&s;entation, they can turn things quite from their natu|ral appearance, as I may perhaps &s;hew you in &s;ome future con&s;erence. Leonora could not but think her&s;elf very ill u&s;ed, and re&s;olved, weakly as &s;he was, that &s;he would be a &s;lave to no body's temper.</P>
<P>When Matilda and Leonora met next time, being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;t with mutual di&s;gu&s;t, their compliments were dry and

They can find in their hearts to part with nothing whil&s;t they live; they will find &s;ome plau&s;ible pretext or o|ther, for which they will retain the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their goods and chattels; rather than give a &s;uitable mea&s;ure of parental a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will &s;uffer the young people to begin the world, under all po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantages. Send &s;uch parents to Newgate, I &s;ay, for they are wor&s;e than mad.</P>
<P>You do me inju&s;tice again, Avaro, in claiming the &s;ole power to your&s;elf, over parents, who will oppre&s;s their &s;ervants, over reach their neighbours, grind the faces of the poor, and &s;ell their &s;ouls to the devil, in order to pro|cure fortunes for their children. This is &s;o far from an|&s;wering the end propo&s;ed, in gaining the love and e&s;teem of the young people, that it has quite a contrary tendency. The greater the e&s;tate, the more impatient will the heir ap|parent be, to be put into quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf. The more there is dependant upon the death of a parent, the more eager will children be to have him out of the way. So eager have &s;ome been, that they have been obliged to u&s;e violence, in order to get the cumber&s;ome old man out of the world. Deliver them up to me, Avaro, for they are all the children of madne&s;s. And yet Lunatio is deemed a fooli&s;h devil, and a &s;on of idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>You are very prone to a&s;cribe to chance or accident, and other &s;uch chimerical gentry, works, the honour of which is due only to my&s;elf. Ay, you are apt to conclude that there is even no madne&s;s in religion. Pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s may prevail ever &s;o, but you never think of madne&s;s. What le&s;s than madne&s;s is it to wor&s;hip a wooden Saviour, or a Je&s;us Chri&s;t of man's making? To adore a
<PB N="330" REF="027249_0328_0FD3EDBBA06F4C88">god that has been baked in an oven; or to pretend to eat the deity? I could open &s;uch a field before you, as would make you wonder at the aboundings of religious madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Go with me to the chambers of the &s;ick, and &s;ee the works of madne&s;s there performed. The lady having over eaten her&s;elf at dinner, finding her &s;tomach unea&s;y, took a gla&s;s of brandy to help dige&s;tion, after that another, &amp;c. till &s;he is now very ill upon it. The phy&s;ician is &s;ent for, and after feeling her pul&s;e, a&s;ks her a pertinent que&s;tion or two, as, Do you feel an unea&s;ine&s;s at your &s;tomach, madam? Does your head ach, madam? Have you a thir&s;t upon you, madam? You were taken ill after dinner, were you, ma|dam?" He pre&s;cribes a gentie purgative draught or two, to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature to throw off her load, after having thus learn|ed the cau&s;e of her di&s;order. Now there's an in&s;tance of a three-fold madne&s;s for you. In the fir&s;t place, although the food was rich and delicious, it was madne&s;s to eat, after na|ture &s;aid it was enough. Secondly, it was madne&s;s to pour &s;uch a quantity of &s;trong liquor, into a &s;tomach already glutted. And thirdly, it was madne&s;s to &s;end for a phy&s;i|cian, &s;eeing &s;he would be well enough by to-morrow noon, by which time nature una&s;&s;i&s;ted might have &s;truggled from beneath its burden. Shall I never have due honour paid to my operations?</P>
<P>This other woman before you, is indeed in a dangerous fever; but &s;he will have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is only a deep cold &s;he has caught, and &s;he hopes to get better in a day or two, with care and keeping warm. By and by, when the &s;ymptoms of death are actually upon her, the phy&s;ician mu&s;t be &s;ent for in all ha&s;te.&mdash;And when the &s;ever alone is more than nature can &s;u&s;tain, &s;he mu&s;t have the additional torment of &s;wallowing medicines, even without a po&s;&s;ibility of their being of the lea&s;t &s;ervice. Is there no madne&s;s in this ca&s;e? Is it not madne&s;s to trifle with a di&s;ea&s;e in its begin|ning, the only time perhaps in which medicine can afford relief? Is it not equally madne&s;s to torment the &s;ick, and
<PB N="331" REF="027249_0329_0FD3ED9AF8947388">and throw money away upon the doctor, when the di&s;ea&s;e is evidently beyond a remedy? And yet you would exclude me from having any &s;hare in the government of mankind.</P>
<P>No, Lunatio, returned I, we do not exclude you. We &s;hould even be glad to have a full account of your operations in &s;ome of our friendly meetings.</P>
</SP>

<P>I could give you &s;uch an account as would &s;ur|pri&s;e you all, might the honours due to my operations be properly acknowledged. But I cannot &s;tay now, having urgent bu&s;ine&s;s in the we&s;t end of a certain metropolis.</P>
<P>Pray, cou&s;in, may a brother fiend be acquainted with it? &s;aid I: he replied, you know, that almo&s;t the one half of the nation is in a &s;tarving condition, and are as it were on the tip-toe of rebellion. Yet in a very great &s;trait how to act. They think it hard to fami&s;h amid&s;t plenty; to die of hunger whil&s;t the barns are full of corn, and the pa&s;tures are well filled with cattle; whil&s;t their govern|ors can afford to &s;pend thou&s;ands at a hor&s;e-race, or in an evening's play. On the other hand, they think it hard to be &s;hot at, by tho&s;e who are murderers by profe&s;&s;ion; or to be hung up at Tyburn for &s;eeking to procure bread for their families.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, the poor wretches are rai&s;ing their voices to government, be&s;eeching their lawgivers to &s;pare &s;o much time from their own plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement, as to take their wretched ca&s;e into &s;erious con&s;ideration, that they may not die by artificial famine. What I aim at is, to per|&s;uade tho&s;e in power to treat their complaints with neglect, and them&s;elves as clamorous unea&s;y, and turbulent peo|ple. In&s;tead of redre&s;&s;ing their grievances, to threaten them with the &s;trict execution of the laws again&s;t rioters. If I am happy enough to gain this point, as I think I &s;hall, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the &s;pirit of madne&s;s raving all over the nation, and even the wi&s;e will become fools.</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ion you know will make even a wi&s;e man mad. Therefore, when their oppre&s;&s;ions can no longer be borne,
<PB N="332" REF="027249_0330_0FD3EDBCC10C3040">there will go forth a &s;pirit of in&s;urrection among the peo|ple; and that &s;hall be followed by a &s;pirit of murder, till all the riots are &s;ufficiently quelled, and the leading in&s;urgents puni&s;hed by death or tran&s;portation. Then will follow a &s;pirit of emigration, and every one almo&s;t will wi&s;h him|&s;elf to have been tran&s;ported at the expence of government. At this very time, there are not le&s;s than five hundred thou&s;and families who are kept in their native country by nothing but the want of means to get cleverly out of it. Neighbouring nations will give all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to the poor to &s;ettle with them; every opportunity will be ta|ken to cro&s;s the Atlantic, till the nation referred to &s;hall become almo&s;t, if not quite depopulated.</P>
<P>Now, the madne&s;s of the &s;cheme lies here. The true riches of a nation are its inhabitants, and the grandeur of the great depends wholly on the numbers of tho&s;e in inferi|or &s;tations. In proportion therefore to the oppre&s;&s;ions of the poor, will the nation decrea&s;e in its &s;trength. Every emi|gration from the mother country, will either increa&s;e the number of coloni&s;ts, or &s;trengthen the hands of natural ene|mies; of cour&s;e the neglect of the pre&s;ent complaints will eventually be the entire ruin of the great men them&s;elves, and the tran&s;lation of the empire to another, and very di&s;tant &s;eat. Yet after all, perhaps it will be alledged, that Lu|natio hath no influence. But I &s;hall rai&s;e my&s;elf an immor|tal name, upon my own foundation. I deign no more con|ver&s;e with a grovelling &s;pirit&mdash;adieu.</P>

<P>This &s;ame Lunatio is a &s;pirit active enough, and we give him due re&s;pect; but he is like all his di&s;ciples, fixed in his own views, and there is no giving him proper ideas of things. I &s;hould be glad, Fa&s;to&s;us, to hear more fully what you were &s;aying la&s;t night concerning the Sadducees, it might be informing to the&s;e younger devils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, &s;ir, they were a &s;et of dei&s;ts among the Jews, who, like the modern dei&s;ts, did not believe that there are any angels good or bad, or &s;hall be any re&s;urrec|tion
<PB N="333" REF="027249_0331_0FD3ED9E28DD8470">from the dead. I did not only per&s;uade the &s;cribes, phari&s;ees, and doctors of the law, to lay a&s;ide judgment, mer|cy and the love of God, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h their own tra|ditions: but wrought upon the Sadducees to prefer their own rea&s;oning to the plaine&s;t declarations of the word of revela|tion. I a&s;&s;ured them, that the well informed author of the book of Job, was under a delu&s;ion, when he &s;aid by the Holy Gho&s;t, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I &s;hall &s;tand with him at the latter day upon the earth, and although after my &s;kin worms de&s;troy this body, yet in the fle&s;h I &s;hall &s;ee God." I per&s;uaded them al&s;o, that the prophet I&s;aiah was under the like mi&s;take, when he foretold, that death &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in victory: as al&s;o Daniel who a&s;&s;erted, "that many, who then &s;lept in the du&s;t &s;hall awake, &s;ome to everla&s;ting life, and &s;ome to everla&s;ting di&s;honour." The&s;e, together with the te&s;timonies of all the prophets, I per|&s;uaded them to reject, merely becau&s;e they could not com|prehend them, nor account for it how the dead &s;hould ri&s;e.&mdash; This you know is the very rea&s;on why modern dei&s;ts are plea&s;ed, under the &s;ame influence, to deny the whole &s;y&s;tem of revealed truth.</P>

<SPEAKER>DISC.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often fea&s;ted my mind on the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of that amazement and &s;urpri&s;e, which &s;hall over|take tho&s;e infidels, when the avenues of immortality &s;hall open before them; and the terrors of an incarnate, a de&s;|pi&s;ed God and Saviour, &s;hall overwhelm them in the floods of horrid de&s;pair. Their pretended virtue, their philo&s;ophic fortitude, their boa&s;ted rea&s;on will fail them, when they &s;ee, to their everla&s;ting confu&s;ion, that he who de&s;pi&s;eth the Son, de&s;pi&s;eth al&s;o the Father who &s;ent him.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dei&s;t is my faithful, deluded di&s;ciple. Where|ever you meet with a man of dei&s;tical principles, you will ea&s;ily di&s;cern my image at large on his forehead, and my mark on his right hand: Nothing but pride can induce a man, to prefer his own rea&s;on to the dictates of &s;acred Re|velation.</P>

Fa&s;to&s;us here &s;topt, and &s;eeming in a terrible agitation, thus addre&s;t his brethren. Let us flee my friends&mdash;Let us flee&mdash;for yonder comes Michael the archangel, and with him a numerous train, with whom we are not able to con|tend. They in&s;tantly took wing, &s;hot through the yielding air, and I &s;aw them no more. Nor am I certain if I &s;hall ever have an opportunity of li&s;tening to their friendly con|ferences again; but if I &s;hould, as is not impo&s;&s;ible, the public may expect to hear what pa&s;&s;es among them, &s;o far as may come to the knowledge of a &s;incere friend to man|kind.</P>
