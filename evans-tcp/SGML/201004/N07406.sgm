I'm forced to &s;ay, I have very lately heard many ab&s;olute Contradictions, and little le&s;s than Untruths from thence! But it is no Won|der, if we will but con&s;ider who it comes from: A Man as I &s;aid before, who delights in mak|ing Divi&s;ions, tramples on Order; dubbs a Man a Prie&s;t (As Kite &s;ays of a Gentleman) in the drawing of a Triger.&mdash;The Prie&s;thood, by all &s;en&s;ible People, at all Times, was looked upon as &s;acred; and it is declared to be &s;o both in the Old and New-Te&s;tament: For In&s;tance,<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Numb. xvith Chapter.</NOTE> <HI>Korah, Dathin,</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> were &s;wallowed up, and two hundred and fifty burnt for pretending to a&s;&s;ume the Office!

not let &s;uch glaring Crimes pa&s;s with Impunity.</P>
<P>Many more In&s;tances might be brought to prove the Sacredne&s;s of the Prie&s;thood, but I &s;hall only mention an Injunction of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, who fore&s;aw the Divi&s;ions that would happen; it may be called a Prophecy, which in this Age, is fully verified,&mdash;it runs thus: <Q>Now I be&s;eech you Brethren, mark them which cau&s;e Divi|&s;ions and Offences, contrary to the Doctine which ye have learned, and avoid them.&mdash; For they that are &s;uch &s;erve not our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> but their own Belly, and by good and fair Speech deceive the Hearts of the Simple.<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Romans xvi, <HI>17</HI> and <HI>18.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That Methodi&s;m (as they call it) is a Doctrine contrary to what we have been taught, is very certain; that it cau&s;es Divi&s;ions and Offences is as true; for what we have from the Holy Go&s;|pel, the Apo&s;tles, and all regular Divines, is Holine&s;s, Humility, Meekne&s;s, and Salvation for all Mankind that follow its glorious Precepts. Mr. &mdash; and his Crew of P&mdash;k-P&mdash;ts, deals Damnation round the World, &s;ends Souls to Hell, that when living, their Bodies was not a Span long!<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">At London, Port&s;mouth, &amp;c.</NOTE> Preaches ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination; damns a Man before he is born; denies it when called upon; falls into the &s;ame again, and yet is credited by many &s;imple Ones.</P>
<P>That they are Mini&s;ters of their <HI>Own Bellies,</HI> is as certain as their fal&s;e Doctrine: For In|&s;tance; A certain Man beging or (rather Robing)

the World under Pretence of an O&mdash;n-H&mdash;e in G&mdash;a, and putting it in his Pur&s;e. It is true, there is &s;uch a Hou&s;e, but it is affirmed, that there is not above &s;ix People in it. A fine Place to build &s;uch a Hou&s;e; among&s;t Wolves and Bears! there may be O&mdash;'s enough of that kind. A fine Handle he made of it, and a very pretty Farce he acted. We have no Occa&s;ion to go out of this Province for the Verity of this; for it is well known how he cram'd his Pockets at his Departure.&mdash; His Doctrine is full of Incon|&s;i&s;tencies, Craft and De&s;ign; his De&s;ign being no other than plundering the Pur&s;e, deceiving the Under&s;tanding; and, under Pretence of unite|ing all Parties in one, &s;ets all Sectaries together by the Ears, that he may have an Oppertunity of picking up Pence from the Whole.</P>
<P>It is well known that the &s;ame Per&s;on, when in a neighbouring Province,<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;ton.</NOTE> preached down the wearing of Rings and other Ornaments of Gold, declaring them to be <HI>a Prophanation of the Go&s;|pel of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord;</HI> by which Means many weak People were induced to pull off tho&s;e Or|naments and pre&s;ent them to him, as an Offer|ing: He very &s;oon after, at a well known Place,<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Philadelphia.</NOTE> recommended the wearing of Rings, as fit Ornaments for tho&s;e that were enligtened by the <HI>New-Birth;</HI> turned Ring-Merchant and &s;old them!&mdash; The Lumber-Hou&s;e, near T&mdash;m-Court, is, as it were, a Play-Hou&s;e, none be|ing admitted into the Gallery without a Ticket.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009444_0008_0F749161BA2BD880" MS="y">Another In&s;tance of the Belly;&mdash;An in&s;pired Taylor in the I&s;le of Wight (a Prie&s;t of the <HI>New Light</HI>) often vi&s;ited an hone&s;t Farmer's Wife, in Ab&s;ence of the Hu&s;band, under Prentence of en|lightening her Under&s;tanding, and admini&s;trat|ing &s;piritual Comfort to her. One certain Day, his Vi&s;it being over and Leave taken, he was met at the Door by the hone&s;t Man, who, ob|&s;erved his Coat &s;tick out, demanded what he had under it? The <HI>Practice of Piety,</HI> he an&s;wer|ed; the Farmer &s;hook him, and down droped a Gammon of Bacon! Fine Piety! the Fellow received a hearty Drubbing, the Courtecy of the Hor&s;e-Pond, and lo&s;t his Bacon; or rather the Farmer found his.</P>
<P>I think this proves them Mini&s;ters of the Bel|ly with a Vengeance. Tho&s;e Facts alone, are &s;ufficient to prove them not Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; for, if we believe the Apo&s;tle before mentioned, we mu&s;t look upon them as Deceiv|ers and Aliens, but they have every Mark about them foretold by that learned Di&s;ciple; a &s;mooth Tongue, a deceitful Heart, and leading away the Unwary and Simple, are Terms that ju&s;tly belong to them. Mr. &mdash; has them all him&s;elf, and that to Perfection; and inculcates them firmly both in the Minds of his underling Ha+berda&s;hers, and non&s;en&s;ical Hearers.&mdash;They are likewi&s;e known to lead away many weak and &s;imple Women; indeed all that follow them ought to be called &s;o, for if they are not &s;o at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, they will not follow him

It has cau&s;ed Suicide in all its Shapes, in&s;titigated &s;ome to hang, others to drown, others to cut the Throats of them&s;elves, &s;ome to burn Pow|der, and others to throw them&s;elves off of Pre|cipices, be&s;ides filling Mad-Hou&s;es, Ho&s;pitals and Jails: And it is no wonder it has this Ef|fect, if we con&s;ider the Principles of <HI>ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination,</HI> which leaves no Room for Sal|vation for a poor Sinner, that by <HI>that</HI> was doom|ed to be damn'd five Thou&s;and Years before he was born;&mdash;he cannot, &s;ays the Enthu&s;ia&s;t, re|pent, no he was doomed a Reprobate from the Begining of Time. This is &s;trikeing hard at two of the noble&s;t Attributes of the Divine Be|ing, his Ju&s;tice, and his Mercy. Yet this is the Doctrine that is taught by Methodi&s;m, and bellowed over the World, by a Sett of Fel|lows that would better adorn the G-ll&mdash;s than a Pulpit. Their Chief, it is allowed has Learn|ing, but his Judgment has been araigned, and found not weighty enough to regulate his mad and extravagant Fondne&s;s for Fame, which la&s;t

I wi&s;h all were &s;uch Enthu&s;ia&s;ts! But do you know what an Enthu&s;ia&s;t is? Enthu&s;ia&s;m is God in you!</HI> But I tell <HI>him</HI> he is mi&s;taken in his Definition: An Enthu&s;ia&s;t in Re|ligion, is one that vainly imagines he is in&s;pired by the Spirit of God; when he is only actuated by the Warmth of his own over-heated Imagi|nation.</P>
<P>After giving his Difinition of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, he &s;narls out <Q>Would you go to Heaven with the Devil in your Bellies?</Q>&mdash;Then we are led into a Garden to view <HI>"a fine Cobweb,"</HI> from thence to a <HI>Tyburn</HI> Execution; poor Lord <HI>F&mdash;s</HI> mu&s;t be hauled over the Coals, and his A&s;hes raked up to prove his Foundation;&mdash;jumbling and filling each Interval in a confu&s;ed Manner with his "<HI>Love for Chri&s;t;</HI>&mdash;" and his <Q>dear, dear Philadelphia.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am quite weary of repeating his Jargon; the whole being a Mixture of, Dam|nation, whim&s;ical Salvation and ab&s;olute Non|&s;ence.&mdash;</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome Per&s;ons may think I have been too &s;atiracal; but if they will but con&s;ider what it was wrote for, I am per&s;uaded they will think there is not a drop too much Gall made u&s;e of.&mdash; The De&s;ign was to paint Methodi&s;m in its na+tural

and odious Colours, in order to prevent its pernicious Effects &s;preading any farther. Glad &s;hould I be could I live to &s;ee the&s;e Divi&s;ions at an End, and tho&s;e Renagadoes return to the Church, e&s;tabli&s;hed by our noble Con&s;titution. As a Member of the Church, I declare I am no Hypocrite, nor am I fond of Fame; but let us not be le&s;s than our&s;elves, that is MEN. There is no Rea&s;on we &s;hould be impo&s;ed on by fabu|lous Reports of de&s;igning Men, or give Credit or Faith to every credulous Fool.&mdash; It is hoped &s;ome abler Pen will take the Cau&s;e in Hand, &s;o that an entire Stop may be put to it; in that Hope I re&s;t, and beg an impartial Judgment on this my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay.</P>
