"Damn them (the Americans), &s;aid William Cobbett, no cur&s;e bad enough can happen to them, for their infamous declaration of independence; but I hope &s;oon to &s;ee the two countries united together again." On this declaration, the deponent remarked, that as he (the deponent) had taken an oath of allegiance and had &s;worn to &s;upport the independence of the United States, he, William Cobbett, mu&s;t expect that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions would be hurtful to the deponent's feelings.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>Before you enter on the body of this pamphlet, reader, I reque&s;t you to ob&s;erve, that I do not deprecate your critici&s;m re&s;pecting the execution of it. On that you may pa&s;s &s;uch &s;entence as plea&s;es you.</P>
<P>That it is extremely imperfect, I acknowledge&mdash;and &s;o, nece&s;&s;arily, mu&s;t every work be, written in &s;uch ha&s;te, and under &s;o many inter|ruptions as I have experienced in this. That it has not co&s;t me more than forty-eight hours application, is a fact, of which I give you the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>But there are two circum&s;tances which I wi&s;h you to bear in mind, during the peru&s;al. One is, that again&s;t &s;uch a fiend as Cobbett, alone, would I write in &s;uch a &s;tyle. My maxim on this &s;ubject is, that to hope to overcome a blackguard, you mu&s;t fight him with his own weapons. This maxim I have long held&mdash;and it does not appear probable, that I &s;hall ever renounce it. If any one denies the ju&s;tice of it, and, through affected delicacy, reprobates the language I have u&s;ed, I wi&s;h him no other puni&s;hment, than to be a&s;&s;ailed by a ruffian, with a cart-full of brickbats, and to have nothing but a &s;mall &s;word to defend him&s;elf with. No &s;mall &s;word for me! I &s;hall give brick bat for brick bat, to Cobbett, and every &s;uch &s;coundrel as may drive me into the field. When I enter the li&s;ts with a gentleman, he and the public &s;hall find I know how to treat him as &s;uch.</P>
<P>The other circum&s;tance, which I wi&s;h impre&s;&s;ed on your mind, is, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to make greater or more &s;incere exertions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not wonderful that I exerted my&s;elf to avoid an open rupture with Cobbett. A former controver&s;y had well nigh co&s;t me my life&mdash;and actually deprived me for fifteen months of the u&s;e of one of my limbs.</NOTE> than I have u&s;ed to avoid the pre&s;ent appeal. I could not, <HI>a priori,</HI> have &s;up|po&s;ed I would have &s;o long borne with the abu&s;e of &s;uch a vulgar, up&s;tart, impudent, rancorous villain.</P>
<P>If you pay due attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances, in every other re&s;pect I cheerfully re&s;ign my&s;elf into your hands, perfectly indifferent what may be the fate of the PLUMB PUDDING&mdash;whether you decree it to the fire after peru&s;al, or give the little &s;tranger a cordial welcome into your library, and there a&s;&s;ign it a permanent &s;tation.</P>

<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM COBBETT.</HEAD>
<P>HOW proud mu&s;t you feel to have arrived at the honour of having a book dedicated to you! You will &s;urely add a new feather to the Egoti&s;t's Cap, who&s;e nodding plumes adorn your head, and write home again to your father to acquaint him with the further di&s;tinc|tion to which you have arrived.<NOTE PLACE="foot">See Porcupine's Works, Vol. ii. p. 299.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is true, the &s;tile of this dedication is &s;omewhat uncommon. I have not be&s;towed quite &s;o much incen&s;e upon you, as &s;ome other dedicators. But the novelty of it ought to recommend it &s;ufficiently to a man of your under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>"Out upon you, beggarly varlet!" you proclaim a fea&s;t&mdash;invite a number of hungry gue&s;ts, and after they &s;it down to table, you throw them <HI>"A Bone to gnaw."</HI> When they complain of your &s;canty fare, you give them <HI>"A Kick"</HI> on the &s;hins. This, even from a Porcu|pine, is har&s;h treatment.</P>
<P>Not &s;o do I &s;erve you. Behold, with true Iri&s;h ho&s;|pitality, I &s;et before you a plentiful di&s;h&mdash;and a fa|vourite one in your own country. The &s;tores whence it has been drawn, are abundantly &s;ufficient to furni&s;h you with entertainment for a long time. The conti|nuance of the fea&s;t depends on your&s;elf and friend, mr. <HI>"Mania Reformatio."</HI> You and he may be con|vinced, that I do not mean either of the per&s;ons alluded to in my letter of the 22d December.</P>
<P>In this pamphlet I have proceeded upon the ground of your being the writer of the ribaldry you publi&s;h. You, and mr. Mania, and I, know better. I have pe|netrated the thin di&s;gui&s;e under which he covered him&s;elf. And if you drive me to it, I &s;wear by your ugly &s;elf, I &s;hall drag him forward, covered with di&s;|grace and di&s;honour. His &mdash;, and his &mdash;, and his &mdash;, &s;hall &s;hine forth in pamphlets and caricatures, till his exi&s;tence &s;hall become a burden.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>PLUMB PUDDING</HI> FOR PETER PORCUPINE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been my fortune to addre&s;s my fellow citizens, more frequently than could po&s;&s;ibly have been acceptable to them&mdash; certainly much more &s;o than has been agreeable to me. Few men have a &s;tronger aver&s;ion to a wanton obtru&s;ion of private cares or controver&s;ies on the public, of whom each individual has enough of his own affairs to occupy his attention.&mdash;Unle&s;s there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify &s;uch appeals, they are vain and im|pertinent. But I conceive when a public attack is made on an individual, he has a right, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es ought to exerci&s;e that right, to in&s;i&s;t on a candid hearing, and a deci&s;ion according to the evidence he brings forward. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I humbly conceive to be one of this kind.</P>
<P>Peace and retirement I prize, and have &s;ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly, as I think will be freely allowed by any one who has patience to peru&s;e the&s;e pages. I have frequently made large &s;acrifices to &s;ecure them. But highly as I value them, I de&s;pi&s;e paying &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="035272_0006_1001BA63E72FDC40">
high a price for them as a di&s;honourable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any blackguard or ru&s;&s;ian that may a&s;&s;ail me with his tongue, his pen, his cudgel, or his fi&s;t. While GOD pre&s;erves my life, I &s;hall defend my&s;elf again&s;t every attack, in &s;uch mode and by &s;uch means, as the nature of the grievance, the character of the ag|gre&s;&s;or, or other circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>Some fa&s;tidious or prejudiced readers, before they proceed thus far, will probably exclaim,&mdash;"Who is this Carey?&mdash;what is he? &mdash;why obtrude his complaints on the public, for the &s;currility and abu&s;e of a wretch, who has, with the utmo&s;t impunity, abu&s;ed many of the mo&s;t exalted characters in the country, and who &s;eems privileged to dart his arrows around, at friend or foe, without a po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s? Why &s;hould an ob&s;cure indi|vidual, like Carey, whom hardly any body knows out of his own di&s;trict, affect &s;uch a keen &s;en&s;ibility re&s;pecting outrages, to which men &s;o far his &s;uperiors in wealth, influence and rank, are obliged to &s;ubmit?"</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s of readers will &s;ay, as I have been told an hun|dred times, "Cobbett is a wretch &s;o far &s;unk in infamy, &s;o de|te&s;ted, de&s;pi&s;ed, and abhorred, by all tho&s;e who&s;e good opinion can reflect honour, that it is madne&s;s and folly to enter the li&s;ts with him. His abu&s;e is regarded by none. What is to be gained in a controver&s;y with a &s;coundrel, whom no lie, ever &s;o barefaced, can &s;hame; who has taken out his diploma by the unanimous vote of the college of blackguards; and who circulates two thou&s;and papers daily, to people whom he calls his &s;ub&s;cribers, but of whom many have in vain tried every means to have their names effaced from that regi&s;ter of di&s;grace, his &s;ub&s;cription li&s;t."</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t cla&s;s of objectors I &s;hall briefly an&s;wer, if the mo&s;t exalted characters choo&s;e to &s;ubmit to the in&s;olence of a low-bred, cowardly alien, who&s;e unparalleled effrontery has induced him frequently to glory in &s;corning to become a citizen of that coun|try in who&s;e affairs he &s;o arrogantly dares to interfere, and on which his blackguardi&s;m entails &s;uch di&s;grace&mdash;I feel no di&s;po&s;ition to imitate a conduct, which I have always regarded as highly reprehen&s;ible and pernicious. If they do not nail his forfeit ears to the pillory of his own counter, give him a new ta&s;te of the cat|o'nine-tails, gently admoni&s;h him with a good cow-&s;kin, have him dragged through the kennels, or at lea&s;t apply for redre&s;s to tho&s;e laws to which he offers daily outrage, they are, I contend, deficient in their duty to them&s;elves and their country. Had any of tho&s;e with whom the mi&s;creant began, dragged him forward to public and condign puni&s;hment, the world would not have been lo&s;t in a&s;to|ni&s;hment whether to a&s;cribe the indulgence the ru&s;&s;ian has met with to the patience or pu&s;illanimity of the United States&mdash;to the
<PB N="7" REF="035272_0007_1001BA65B3E8D950">
highe&s;t degree of magnanimity or to the oppo&s;ite extreme. Cer|tain it is, that there is not a parallel in&s;tance to be found in the records of any nation, of an alien &s;uffered to a&s;&s;ume a more dic|tatorial air than the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the country; for I a&s;&s;ert, without the &s;malle&s;t fear of contradiction, that this reptile dictates to the government in a &s;tyle infinitely more authoritative than that of either the la&s;t or pre&s;ent pre&s;ident of the United States. More of this anon.</P>
<P>What! &s;hall it be regarded as a public duty, to hunt out and bring to ju&s;tice an incendiary who puts a torch to my hou&s;e&mdash;or a petty villain who &s;tops me on the highway, and robs me of a few dollars, to protract a wretched exi&s;tence, perhaps to &s;ave a &s;ick wi&s;e and helple&s;s children from &s;tarvation&mdash;and by what lo|gic can it be proved to be otherwi&s;e than criminal, to pa&s;s over the diurnal attacks of an unprincipled ra&s;cal, who hardly prints a &s;ingle paper void of the vile&s;t abu&s;e and &s;currility? Certainly if Shake&s;peare wrote correctly, and that he did, no man will deny, when he declared, that
<Q><L>"Good name, in man or woman,</L>
<L>"Is the immediate jewel of their &s;ouls:</L>
<L>"Who &s;teals my pur&s;e, &s;teals tra&s;h; 'tis &s;omething, nothing:</L>
<L>"'Twas mine&mdash;'tis his&mdash;and has been &s;lave to thou&s;ands;</L>
<L>"But he that filches from me my good name,</L>
<L>"Robs me of that, which not enriches him,</L>
<L>"And makes me poor indeed:"</L></Q>
there is an incalculable difference between the villany of &s;uch a mi&s;creant as Cobbett, and that of hundreds who have forfeited their lives to the &s;anguinary penal codes of Europe, or who are by the mild American &s;y&s;tem devoted to beating of hemp and &s;awing of marble. If the&s;e po&s;itions be true, and that they are, every man of rectitude will agree, it mu&s;t be the incumbent duty of all good citizens to u&s;e their endeavours to erect &s;ome mound to oppo&s;e that overwhelming torrent of malignity, defamation and blackguardi&s;m, that threatens to de&s;troy all di&s;tinction between right and wrong, and to involve in one indi&s;criminate ma&s;s the upright and &s;coundrelly part of the community.</P>
<P>To the other cla&s;s of objectors I reply, that no man living entertains a more contemptible opinion of Cobbett than I do. To &s;ay that he is a di&s;grace to human nature, as has been already &s;aid, is a very faint expre&s;&s;ion of my idea. I can &s;afely declare, and appeal to Heaven for the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, that of all the villains that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a printing pre&s;s, I never knew or ever
<PB N="8" REF="035272_0008_1001A1765DE7E240">
heard of more than one or two that could in any degree be com|pared to him. I have con&s;idered his conduct and character with attention, and I have not been able to di&s;cover the appearance of more than one good quality in him&mdash;and that is, a certain kind of candour (perhaps I &s;hould rather &s;ay, impudence), which makes him &s;corn to ma&s;k the atrocity and villany of his views.</P>
<P>However, ba&s;e and contemptible as he indubitably is, were he infinitely more &s;o&mdash;but heaven knows that is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;I never could agree with tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert that his attacks are altogether unworthy of notice. A man who circulates two thou&s;and papers daily, may impair the reputation and re&s;pectability of the mo&s;t excellent of the &s;ons of men. It is a trite ob&s;ervation, but too much a-propos to be omitted here, that ince&s;&s;ant dropping of water will wear away the harde&s;t &s;tone. In like manner, ince&s;|&s;ant, unrepelled &s;currility, buffoonery, and detraction, &s;uch as Cobbett u&s;es, mu&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly wear away the hard-earned fame of the be&s;t &s;pent life. If he has readers, they cannot re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion, whether or not, to borrow one of his own elegant figures, they pay for his "dirty di&s;h clout."</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations in&s;pired me with an abhorrence of any warfare with the mi&s;creant. That I u&s;ed many and &s;incere efforts to avoid it, will appear in the &s;equel, to the &s;atisfaction of his warme&s;t friends and parti&s;ans, if he has any left. But let no man do me the inju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e I feared it. I knew the &s;coun|drel too well. I either gro&s;&s;ly undervalue Cobbett, or overrate my&s;elf, if I am not able to meet him on any ground whatever. Dive&s;t his ribald writings of their fal&s;ehoods and Billing&s;gate, and you rob them of life and &s;oul&mdash;you leave behind but a wretched caput mortuum, that would lull a Cerberus to &s;leep. The abu&s;ive language he u&s;es, &s;uch as ra&s;cal, &s;coundrel, blackguard and ruf|fian, can be ea&s;ily acquired. I think before the fellow has pro|ceeded thus far, he will freely allow, that although I have newly opened &s;tore, and have not received my &s;upplies from a camp or the purlieus of St. Giles's, my &s;tock is, neverthele&s;s, as copious and inexhau&s;tible as his own. I have taken him for my model, and pride my&s;elf on being a rapid proficient: and expect to make much greater progre&s;s. As to the boa&s;ted circulation of his paper, if I am driven, by a continuance of his teazing abu&s;e, to e&s;tabli&s;h one, which appears at pre&s;ent not impro|bable, I pledge my&s;elf to u&s;e &s;uch indu&s;try in the circulation of it, as to make it, within half a year, at lea&s;t co-exten&s;ive with Porcupine's Gazette. If I am provoked to take this &s;tep, may Otway's whole collection of cur&s;es, "Pride, poverty, &s;hame, and the name of villain," light on me, if I ever quit my grapple of him, till I render his in&s;am co-equal with his guilt, and make

him cur&s;e the hour in which he a&s;&s;ailed a man who never offered him provocation. Before two months from this date, the 7th of January, 1799, I pledge my&s;elf to forfeit five hundred dollars, if he does not confe&s;s that I am a tolerable adept in the art of di&s;|per&s;ing pamphlets. This &s;hall be read in every city, town, village, and hamlet, in the United States, to which there is a con|veyance by &s;tage, by mail, by waggon, or by cart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Publication of Porcupine's Life. His claim to the title of Liar e&s;tabli&s;hed. M. Carey's letter to him. An&s;wer. Second letter. In&s;olent reply.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO enable the reader to under&s;tand the nature of the controver&s;y in which I find my&s;elf engaged, with the mo&s;t execrable wretch that heaven in its wrath ever allowed to infe&s;t a country, and arm citizen again&s;t citizen, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;cend to the publication of what the mi&s;creant calls his Life, in other words, the romance which he publi&s;hed under the pompous title of "The Life and Adventures of Peter Porcupine, with a full and fair Account of his authoring Tran&s;actions." In pp. 36, 7, he has the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr. Carey. This was, to make u&s;e of a culinary figure, jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. Mr. Carey received me as book&s;ellers generally receive authors (I mean authors whom they hope to get but little by): he looked at the title from top to bottom, and then at me from head to foot.&mdash;"No, <HI>my lad,</HI>" &s;ays he, "I don't think it will &s;uit."&mdash;<HI>My lad!</HI>&mdash;God in heaven forgive me! I believe that, at that moment, I wi&s;hed for another yel|low fever to &s;trike the city; not to de&s;troy the inhabitants, but to furni&s;h me too with <HI>the &s;ubject of a pamphlet,</HI> that might make me rich.&mdash;Mr. Carey has &s;old hundreds of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;ince that time, and therefore, I dare &s;ay he highly approved of them, when he came to a peru&s;al. At any rate I mu&s;t not forget to &s;ay, that he behaved honourably in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for, he
<PB N="10" REF="035272_0010_1001BA6BF96F04A8">
promi&s;ed not to make known the author, and he certainly kept his word, or the di&s;covery would not have been re&s;erved for the month of June, 1796. This circum&s;tance, con&s;idering Mr. Carey's politics, is greatly to his honour, and has almo&s;t wiped from my memory that contumelious "<HI>my lad."</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is almo&s;t irrelevant to the &s;ubject of this pamphlet, but I mu&s;t be pardoned for ob&s;erving, that this very minute detail is a ti&s;&s;ue of fal&s;ehood, from beginning to end, except that the pam|phlet in que&s;tion was offered me to print, and refu&s;ed. I read only the title-page. It was &s;currilous. I concluded the contents to be of the &s;ame complexion, and refu&s;ed to be the publi&s;her. But if ever I could depend on my memory, in any tran&s;action in the whole cour&s;e of my life, Cobbett did not appear with the ma|nu&s;cript. It was brought me by a child. It follows, that all the very high degree of merit a&s;cribed to me, for &s;o honourably keeping the &s;ecret, was one of Cobbett's waking dreams.</P>
<P>Some explanation is here nece&s;&s;ary. A few weeks after I had refu&s;ed to print the pamphlet, it was adverti&s;ed by Mr. Bradford, and became a frequent &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. I recollected the title, and endeavoured al&s;o to recollect the bearer. As the tran&s;action had made a very &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, I found it not ea&s;y at fir&s;t to a&s;certain the per&s;on. But the re&s;ult of my endeavours was a conviction that it had been a child. And I am now ready to &s;wear, if nece&s;&s;ary, that to the be&s;t of my knowledge, judgment; belief, and recollection, the "Modern Tartuffe," as it was originally &s;tiled, was not offered to me by William Cobbett, but by a child, apparently about twelve or thirteen years of age. I knew not the wretched, ra&s;cally writer. I never &s;aw him, to my knowledge, till he called at my &s;tore in January 1797, to purcha&s;e a map, to pay for which he had not money in his pocket; and on telling me he would &s;end it, I a&s;ked his name&mdash;He &s;aid, William Cobbett. I gazed at him&mdash; and the moment he went out of the door, called my family to look after him, as I &s;hould have done at a leopard, an elephant, or any other &s;trange animal. Tho&s;e who know him, will judge whether a man who has once &s;een his carotty head and Draw|can&s;ir face, could ever forget him.</P>
<P>Of the Grub-&s;treet production, a worthy harbinger of the fu|ture labours of his "muddy brain," the &s;cribbler &s;ays, I "&s;old hundreds." To what numberle&s;s detections and what di&s;|graces will a liar expo&s;e him&s;elf! Referring to the account current of Mr. Bradford, from whom alone they were to be had, I find I &s;old &s;ixty copies; neither more nor le&s;s. Tho&s;e who may doubt whether Cobbett would &s;o palpably run the ri&s;que of

<P>Let it be not &s;aid, that he would not tell a lie in &s;o plain a ca&s;e, and to an&s;wer no conceivable purpo&s;e. Inveterate habits are not to be overcome: A liar mu&s;t and will tell lies&mdash;if they only keep him in practice, 'tis well&mdash;if any point is to be gained by it, &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of his anonymous publications induced him to creep forth from his den, and ru&s;h into the glare of day, which he had &s;hunned with as much &s;olicitude as the midnight robber or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.&mdash;In June 1796, he avowed him&s;elf, took a &s;tore, and openly &s;et tho&s;e whom he had injured, at defiance. He was immediately attacked by a ho&s;t of anonymous writers, who &s;eemed determined to embroil him and me in a quarrel.&mdash;They a&s;&s;umed it as a fact, that fear was the &s;ole rea&s;on why he had made &s;uch honourable mention of me. It was their wi&s;h to oblige Cobbett to abu&s;e me, in order to evince that he was not a coward. I con|fe&s;s I did not deem it very kind of tho&s;e gentlemen, whoever they were, to place &s;uch a foul-mouthed &s;coundrel in &s;o very unplea&s;ant a dilemma. I felt on the occa&s;ion as a man would with a good &s;uit of clothes on, if he perceived an outrageous &s;cavenger with a cart full of filth, and a &s;hovel, dealing it forth on every &s;ide &mdash;Cobbett was the &s;cavenger. I wi&s;hed &s;incerely to avoid his &s;hovel. I knew that the bru&s;h of public enquiry would rub out the &s;tains. But I did not wi&s;h to put them or my&s;elf to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing that bru&s;h. I was &s;atisfied with the &s;tation I held in the e&s;timation of my fellow citizens. I had lived twelve years among them, and had never &s;oiled my hands or my character by any of the various &s;chemes or &s;peculations that have produced &s;uch fraud, di&s;grace and ruin. I had, during the whole period, pur&s;ued with unremitting indu&s;try a u&s;eful and honourable bu&s;ine&s;s. For &s;ix years of the time, under an extreme degree of difficulty and embarra&s;&s;ment, I had carried on the American Mu&s;eum, a work to which enlightened foreigners and citizens of equal re&s;pectability had been &s;o partial as to declare that it reflected honour on the country which afforded its editor an a&s;ylum. During the remainder of the time, I had printed a number of works equally valuable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The proceeds of two of the&s;e works alone were above 60,000 dol|lars. Of Guthrie's Geography I printed 2500, and of Gold&s;mith's Ani|mated Nature, 3000. The former &s;ells for &s;ixteen and the latter for nine dollars. At this rate they would produce 67,000 dollars; but as part of them were di&s;po&s;ed of to &s;ub&s;cribers, at a lower price, I take the above round &s;um.</NOTE>&mdash;and
<PB N="12" REF="035272_0012_1001BA71830E3A00">
done bu&s;ine&s;s to the amount of 300,000 dollars, with men of various nations and parties&mdash; and among the whole there was not one of real re&s;pectability of character from whom, if need were, I could not procure the mo&s;t flattering te&s;timonials. I had frequently given employment, for months to|gether, to at lea&s;t one hundred and fifty per&s;ons, in the various departments of paper-making, printing, engraving, binding, &amp;c. &amp;c. and I can with pride and plea&s;ure declare, that I cannot at this moment recollect the name of one decent, de&s;erving per|&s;on, whom I ever employed, that would not gladly work for me again. I had a large and growing family to maintain&mdash;and was engaged in an exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s which demanded my whole time and mo&s;t uncea&s;ing attention. I had not therefore time to &s;quan|der on appeals, explanations, rejoinders and replies. All the&s;e rea&s;ons, and numerous others, combined to render me anxious to e&s;cape Cobbett's abu&s;e, which I thus early re&s;olved to take every prudent mea&s;ure to avert. But &s;hould it prove unavoidable, I as early re&s;olved to carry on the war with all the powers which God and nature, education and ob&s;ervation had be&s;towed on me. From this determination I have not &s;werved one moment &s;ince that pe|riod, and to it is owing the pre&s;ent publication.</P>
<P>I hope no part of the preceding paragraph will be a&s;cribed to vanity or egoti&s;m. Both I heartily de&s;pi&s;e. But there are cer|tain occa&s;ions, and the pre&s;ent I believe is one of them, in which it is allowable for a man to urge what he can fairly advance in his own defence.</P>
<P>My &s;olicitude was con&s;iderably augmented by a report &s;pread with &s;ome indu&s;try, that I was the writer of one of the pam|phlets again&s;t Cobbett. I therefore &s;ent him a letter, of which the following is a copy:

<P><Q>The O'Careys, on the contrary, are guilty of every mean|ne&s;s that intere&s;ted &s;ervility can invent. The other evening they a&s;&s;erted that I mu&s;t be paid by Britain, becau&s;e my ga|zette and Cen&s;or were &s;o cheap; when no longer ago than ye&s;terday, their mumper, in order to prevail on a per&s;on to quit my paper for theirs, told him that theirs was much cheaper.</Q> His view was, by involving me in the abu&s;e, to im|po&s;e &s;ilence on my brother Here it is proper for me to ob&s;erve, that I never had the &s;malle&s;t right, title, or intere&s;t in or to that paper, nor the United States Recorder, publi&s;hed &s;ub&s;equently by my brother.

On Saturday morning, about ten o'clock, I &s;ent him the following letter:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>May 6, 1797.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. COBBETT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am concerned to find that you appear di&s;po&s;ed to force me into a paper warfare with you, whether I will or no. This does not corre&s;pond with the declaration in your billet of Sep|tember 7, '96&mdash;'It is my &s;incere de&s;ire to live in peace with all the book&s;ellers&mdash;and towards none does this de&s;ire direct it&s;elf than towards Mr. Carey.'</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035272_0015_1001BA7A147A3BB8">The inference, that &s;uch is your di&s;po&s;ition, I draw from the expre&s;&s;ion of the 'O'Careys,' in your paper of la&s;t evening.</P>
<P>That this was intended to implicate me, <HI>may be</HI> a mi&s;take. I hope, but hardly &s;uppo&s;e, it is. But that a majority of your readers <HI>will</HI> implicate me, I feel per&s;uaded.</P>
<P>The aver&s;ion I formerly expre&s;&s;ed to this warfare, has not di|mini&s;hed. On the contrary, it is &s;tronger than ever. I therefore make this one more effort to avoid it. Should we be engaged in it, I am determined to be able to exculpate my&s;elf from its con&s;equences, whatever they may be.</P>
<P>I have merited no ill treatment at your hands, except for the &s;in of differing from you, <HI>toto coelo,</HI> in political opinions. I have done you no injury. In the account of your Life, you profe&s;&s;ed your gratitude towards me; what has cancelled this debt?</P>
<P>I have, you mu&s;t acknowledge, taken no common pains to e&s;|cape a conte&s;t with you. To me it would be irk&s;ome, as can well be conceived. For if you &s;lander and abu&s;e me, what am I to do? Very unfortunately, in bodily &s;trength I am far your inferior. Were I, as, in my humble opinion, every man ought in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to attempt to procure redre&s;s by the cudgel, for the injuries of the pen, it is more than probable I &s;hould only meet with an aggravation of the injury. But it is no rea|&s;on becau&s;e I am weaker than you, that I am therefore to be &s;ubject to your unprovoked attacks.</P>
<P>Shall I return &s;lander for &s;lander, abu&s;e for abu&s;e? In this line I am unpracti&s;ed. I de&s;pi&s;e a recurrence to the&s;e wea|pons. Be&s;ides, the utmo&s;t of my ingenuity could devi&s;e no|thing to add to what has been written again&s;t you ineffectually. I &s;corn to borrow &s;currility from any man. I hope there is no vanity in the declaration, that in fair, open, gentlemanly controver&s;y, there lives not a man from whom I &s;hould &s;hrink &mdash;but abu&s;e I have never employed, and never &s;hall willingly.</P>
<P>Should I &s;ue you for damages?&mdash;Poor &s;atisfaction to be de|rived from dancing attendance in courts, to have perhaps a few hundred dollars damages decreed, after an expence of time worth probably double the amount!</P>
<P>What other alternative remains? You fight no duels. In this latter mode, the inequality ari&s;ing from a di&s;parity of &s;trength and &s;ize, and from my lamene&s;s, is done away. But to this <HI>ultima ratio</HI> there are &s;trong objections. Arms have been your trade for years: I have never drawn but two triggers in my life. Here, therefore, the inequality returns, though not in &s;o great a degree. But this is not my only objection. I have a wife and four &s;mall children to &s;upport. On my indu&s;try they depend. I owe it to them to incur no honourably-avoidable
<PB N="16" REF="035272_0016_1001A18836F50BC8">
ri&s;que: this motive, and a decent regard for the laws of the &s;tate, induce me to take every &s;tep that can be taken with pro|priety, to avert a commencement of ho&s;tilities. But powerful as the&s;e motives are, and powerful they mu&s;t &s;urely be allowed, no man &s;hall abu&s;e or in&s;ult me with impunity.</P>
<P>I once more, &s;ir, in the &s;ame &s;pirit as dictated my former letter, declare, that I have never written or publi&s;hed a line or &s;entence again&s;t you. I have long done writing on politics. I have no concern in nor control over the Daily Adverti&s;er; and cannot, therefore, be re&s;pon&s;ible for its contents. In fact, although I regard it as extremely well conducted in ge|neral, yet articles have appeared in it, which I di&s;approve as much as any thing that has ever appeared in your paper.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely &s;orry to have this letter a&s;cribed, on the one hand, to a de&s;ire of intimidating you, or, on the other, to any fear of you. They are both equally remote from my heart. My wi&s;h is peace. I have done nothing to provoke ho&s;tility. As long as in my power, I &s;hall avoid it&mdash;when it comes, I &s;hall know how to meet it.</P>
<P>This letter, like my former, is intended for your own peru&s;al. The other, contrary to my wi&s;hes, was divulged. Some ano|nymous mi&s;creant &s;coundrel, whom perhaps I may di&s;cover and repay, &s;tated it to be a deprecation of your wrath, for in|juries I had offered. Heaven and hell are not more oppo&s;ed to each other, than this idea is to truth.</P>

<P>In this letter I &s;tudied to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e between the appearance of apprehen&s;ion on the one hand, and of threatening on the other. How far I &s;ucceeded, the reader mu&s;t decide.

<P>SOME time afterwards, there appeared in the Grub-&s;treet Gazette, a libel, calculated to injure me in my bu&s;ine&s;s. This was proper ground of action. I felt it therefore a duty incum|bent on me, to bring the que&s;tion fully and fairly before a court of ju&s;tice, whether any vagabond, &s;coundrel, mi&s;creant, or ruffian, who could rai&s;e one or two hundred dollars, to purcha&s;e a printing pre&s;s and a few types, &s;hould, with his pre&s;s and his types, likewi&s;e purcha&s;e the very important privilege of blackening the fair fame, di&s;turbing the peace, or de&s;troying the intere&s;ts and pro&s;pects of any one whom he or &s;uch lurking a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins as he might employ, or as might employ him, &s;hould mark out as objects of their wrath, their malice, their envy, or for the alleviation of their poverty.
<PB N="19" REF="035272_0019_1001BA81B9DCD208">
For it is to be ob&s;erved, that as many men are defamed by un|principled libellers, to keep beggary and &s;tarvation from the door, as from motives of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here let me beg the reader to make a &s;olemn pau&s;e. Let him not be led a&s;tray by names. Let him a&s;k him&s;elf, whether this is not the real que&s;tion in all ca&s;es of this kind, &s;o far as re&s;pects attacks on individuals in private life, and, let me add, on the private character of public men.&mdash;I prize, as ine&s;timable, the liberty of the pre&s;s&mdash;the liberty I mean, of fairly and boldly, but candidly and decently, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the public conduct of public men of all ranks, and likewi&s;e of all parties&mdash;But the more inva|luable is the liberty, the more dete&s;table is the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s. So far are they, in fact, from being in&s;eparably connected, as the &s;coundrels who live by the di&s;honourable trade of &s;urrility pretend, that the exuberance of the one has a direct tendency to de&s;troy the other. What would be thought, were a farmer to in|&s;i&s;t that it was nece&s;&s;ary to cheri&s;h the tares and weeds that were choaking up the good grain, in order to promote the growth of that very grain? Surely that he was a fit candidate for a mad-hou&s;e. His claim is equally &s;trong, who advocates the licentiou&s;ne&s;s, for fear of impairing the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion thus brought before the courts of ju&s;tice, is of importance to two large cla&s;&s;es or de&s;criptions of men&mdash;the good and the bad. The former, &s;hould there be no legal redre&s;s to be had, will find them&s;elves, &s;o far as re&s;pects this matter, re|duced to a &s;tate of nature. They will therefore be under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ociating for &s;elf protection, to &s;upply the defects of the law. An a&s;&s;ociation of this kind would awe into &s;ome re|gard for decency, cowardly bullies, &s;uch as Cobbett, who are en|couraged to proceed in their villainous career by the impunity they experience through the contempt, fear, indolence or other mi&s;taken motives of the per&s;ons whom they offer up as &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>That the bad are equally intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue of this que&s;tion, will admit of no doubt. Should the deci&s;ion be in favour of the quill drivers, and printers, what a glorious field is opened for the exerci&s;e of talents hitherto lying concealed or buried in ob&s;curity! What father, who has an athletic &s;on, &s;uch as Cobbett, will be &s;o unju&s;t as to de&s;tine him to trundle a wheel|barrow, &s;aw wood, or carry a hod for a bricklayer, when he can make &s;o much more comfortable provi&s;ion for him by procuring him a few types, a pre&s;s, and enabling him to e&s;tabli&s;h a blackguard new&s;paper? In&s;tead of living and dying, as unkind fate would otherwi&s;e have obliged him, at the bottom of the wheel, he will ri&s;e, at the &s;ubject of this pamphlet has done, to the &s;ummit, enjoy all the good things of this world, be care&s;&s;ed by

the great, and, in fine, may hope to dictate laws to a ri&s;ing empire. 'Tis no objection to this idea, that the per&s;on has not the talents of a writer; there never will be wanting men who&s;e cowardice equals their malignity, and who will be happy to have a ruffian to &s;tand forward between them and the correction or puni&s;hment which their villainy de&s;erves. There is no arguing again&s;t facts: and the mo&s;t incredulous mu&s;t coincide in opinion with me, when they con&s;ider what Cobbett has been, what he now is, and the wealth and influence he has acquired.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. John Ward Fenno. United Iri&s;hmen. Plots, Combinations, and Con&s;piracies. Explanation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT here becomes nece&s;&s;ary to introduce on the &s;tage another per&s;onage, who has been the means of involving me in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. This gentleman is Mr. John Ward Fenno, editor and proprietor of the Gazette of the United States. For many weeks he had terrified the public with reports of plots, combinations, and con&s;piracies, of United Iri&s;hmen. Tho&s;e who read his paper might have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;upinene&s;s of the government of the United States, and their culpable ne|glect of the Ca&s;&s;andra's voice that warned them of the impending and tremendous danger.</P>
<P>This intrepid young man was not to be deterred from the per|formance of his duty by the inattention which his admonitions experienced. With truly Roman greatne&s;s of &s;oul he i&s;&s;ued the following public &s;pirited and undaunted declaration, in his paper of the 26th November la&s;t:</P>
<P>"I have a li&s;t of members of the &s;ociety&mdash;to this I &s;hall always be happy to receive additions.&mdash;Facts, al&s;o, identifying the mem|ber&s;hip of any individual whatever, will be u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary. When as complete as I can make it, the names of the whole of them &s;hall be publi&s;hed, from the gloomy, clo&s;e-working, cut-throat-looking &s;on of Galen, to the <HI>fatuitous and &s;puttering book|&s;eller,</HI> though the knives of the whole bloody gang were at my brea&s;t. Similar li&s;ts &s;hould be collected every where, and the villains dragged forth to light. For light to them is death."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035272_0021_1001BA87EC16B670">I read this paragraph, and was at a lo&s;s to a&s;certain who was the <HI>"fatuitous &s;puttering book&s;eller?"</HI> Although I never had a very extraordinary opinion of my own talents, yet (pardon my vanity, reader) my mode&s;ty never went &s;o far as to con&s;ign me to the cla&s;s of <HI>fatui,</HI> or fools. I took the cap, tried it, thought it did not fit, and threw it among the re&s;t of the Iri&s;h book&s;ellers, of whom there are four in this city. Had I &s;u&s;pected the fool's cap to be intended for me, I think it more than probable I &s;hould have &s;aved Mr. Fenno &s;ome of the unea&s;ine&s;s which this affair has cau&s;ed him, my&s;elf the trouble of writing, and the public that of wading through this pamphlet. But the fates otherwi&s;e decreed.</P>
<P>At length, after the expectations of the public had been rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch, when every body looked forward to &s;ee li&s;ts of hundreds of thou&s;ands of tho&s;e Cannibals, the blood-thir&s;ty United Iri&s;hmen, the mountain was heard to groan, and after many hard throes, the mou&s;e crept out. This mou&s;e, courteous reader, was a li&s;t of &s;eventeen names, prefaced by the following ob&s;ervations, in the United States Gazette of Tue&s;day the 18th of December la&s;t.</P>
<P>"All ages and all forms of government, have abounded in con|&s;piracies: and if the&s;e have &s;ometimes produced beneficial re&s;ults, they have never been derived from the calculations of the con&s;pi|rators. But our own has been remarkably fertile in the produc|tion of con&s;piracies of the wor&s;t kind, carried on by the wor&s;t agents, and promoted by the wor&s;t of means&mdash;&s;o that it may ju&s;tly be called the <HI>age of in&s;urrection;</HI> unhappily it mu&s;t be added, they have of late experienced a too uniform &s;ucce&s;s. Whether our country is to be immolated on this &s;anguinary altar, de|pends wholly on our timely and vigorous exertion. An exhibi|tion of uncommon nerve can alone pre&s;erve us from uncommon evils; that con&s;piracy, once ripened and matured, our nerve and our energy will rivet &s;tronger our chains.</P>
<P>"We have read of empires, a&s;&s;ailed and overthrown by con&s;pira|tors who &s;prang up like mu&s;hrooms in the night; fellows of ye&s;|terday, unknown, unthought of. But le&s;t conviction be withheld from this evidence, let us turn from what we read, to what we have <HI>&s;een.</HI> We have &s;een the fir&s;t empire in the world &s;hattered to a ma&s;s of ruins, its forms de&s;troyed, its in&s;titutions rever&s;ed, its language overrun with barbarous and jargonic terms, its man|ners debauched, its religion de&s;troyed, its con&s;equence annihilated, and its very name rendered a loath&s;ome reproach; have we not &s;een them brought about by a &s;et of men contemptible in their ori|gin, character, and at fir&s;t in number, and do we, after all this, imagine our&s;elves una&s;&s;ailable to the United Iri&s;hmen? Think you, the victims of St. Bartholomew's day imagined, an hour before their fate, the terrible &s;troke which awaited them?</P>
<P>"While, in the emphatic language of the Roman orator, many
<PB N="22" REF="035272_0022_1001BA89EB400968">
are found exclaiming of each of the&s;e murderers, <HI>"tamen hic vivit,"</HI> others, &s;unk in be&s;tial &s;lothfulne&s;s and inanity, cry, "What a fu&s;s is making about the United Iri&s;hmen! Who are they, what are they, where are they?" A&s;toni&s;hing non&s;en&s;e! amazing infatuation! De&s;perate, de&s;tructive, devoted &s;tupidity! Be|cau&s;e your enemy is &s;ecret, clo&s;e, and unfathomable; becau&s;e his de&s;igns are dark, and defy re&s;earch, do you doubt their ten|dency and power to harm you? Believe me, the&s;e con&s;pirators, while they are &s;ecret as the grave, will be found daring as death, when their plot ripens to explo&s;ion.</P>
<P>"What is an <HI>United Iri&s;hman?</HI> May not Iri&s;hmen unite as well as we? Look to Ireland for its character, and behold it written in <HI>blood!</HI> From the time of earl Strongbow, the Iri&s;h have borne a character, our conceptions of which it is hard to find words to do ju&s;tice to. From being almo&s;t the &s;ole depo&s;itaries of &s;cience, the ma&s;s has degenerated into the mo&s;t brutal ignorance, whil&s;t from that extremity of oppo&s;ition in their character, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them in a peculiar manner from all the re&s;t of the word, their i&s;le has contributed beyond her proportion, in men of eminence, as &s;oldiers, poets, orators, &s;tate&s;men and divines. An Iri&s;h <HI>gentleman</HI> is one of the fine&s;t characters in nature. The re&s;t of the nation is repre&s;ented by the bulk of tho&s;e who come to this country&mdash;&s;uch men as Burke, Lyon, Reynolds, old Findley, Smiley and Duane, the bare mention of whom is &s;ufficient, without the trouble of elucidation.</P>
<P>"Imagine a whole nation of &s;uch men as the&s;e, and figure to your|&s;elves a congregation of every noxious, every venomous propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>"Behold their deeds, and behold deeds worthy &s;uch authors. <HI>Wild,</HI> and untameable, they wage ince&s;&s;ant war with one another, and Ireland has been a Golgotha from the earlie&s;t period of hi&s;|tory. But her bloody bands of <HI>United Iri&s;hmen</HI> have exceeded in the atrocity of their ma&s;&s;acres even the horrors of the Druidi|cal rites, and ab&s;olutely cut-throats, like Shake&s;peare's Hot&s;pur, for <HI>diver&s;ion.</HI> Thus much for their character at home. This character has driven them thence. Are they then of a different ca&s;t here? No: coelum non animum mutant. By carnage and plunder they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted there: in ma&s;&s;acre and ravage they can alone be happy here.</P>
<Q>"Nomenque erit indelebile ve&s;trum."</Q>
<P>"The various affiliated &s;ocieties of United Iri&s;hmen in this country, form one intimate, clo&s;ely connected band&mdash;the whole being only &s;o many ramifications of the mother &s;ociety, the &s;u|perintending guidance of which they are directed, and with which they keep up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence as well as with each other. Thus, it is evident, the gang in America is altogether &s;ubordinate to that of Ireland: Its views, it appears, are equally &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="035272_0023_1001BA8EAC2FE3C0">"The &s;cheme, in its rude outline, is to bring on a revolutionary &s;tate in America, which, by di&s;organi&s;ing all the plans of com|merce and trade, might dimini&s;h the means of Great Britain for cru&s;hing the in&s;urrection in Ireland. They had neverthele&s;s marked the ramifications of a revolutionary form, which was to have been in&s;tituted in order the better to prolong tho&s;e di&s;orders which it was their fir&s;t object to excite. They coale&s;ced with the jacobins (mo&s;t of the leaders of whom have actually been admitted within the pale of the &s;ociety) &s;o far as regarded the &s;talking-hor&s;e, behind the &s;anction of who&s;e <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> fame, all this mi&s;chief was to be brewed. He is the focus whence emanate all their deep-laid de&s;igns. He is now (though a <HI>&s;alary man</HI>) ab&s;enting him&s;elf from that po&s;t which he fills and defiles, to forward the plans of his myrmidons by writing inflammatory re&s;olutions again&s;t the alien and &s;edition bills, and &s;tirring up the people to in&s;urrection. This tall, aukward figure (I do not mean the noted <HI>tory</HI> and man of laurel) imagines, that under the &s;em|blance of philo&s;ophical retirement, he &s;ufficiently cloaks tho&s;e daring machinations, which will neverthele&s;s drag him one day, a trembling criminal, to the bar of ju&s;tice.&mdash;Imitating a certain fooli&s;h bird, he runs his head into Helvetius, and imagines him&s;elf concealed, becau&s;e he does not &s;ee that he is &s;een.</P>
<P>"Having u&s;ed this great man 'till their purpo&s;es had been &s;uf|ficiently advanced, he would have been laid on the &s;helf, or perhaps decently interred. He would have given way to men of greater daring&mdash;&s;tronger nerve&mdash;better qualified to &s;ail on the "tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of liberty." Reynolds would &s;ucceed to the director&s;hip: for a Talleyrand, in body as well as mind, we need not look beyond his mo&s;t impudent and meddle&s;ome a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>"To further the&s;e ends, every member, on initiation into the &s;ociety, pays into the general fund 1 guinea, which contribution is annually continued, and increa&s;ed by requi&s;itions, as occa&s;ion calls.</P>
<P>"A permanent committee of corre&s;pondence has exi&s;ted for three years with the executive directory of France, and another with the revolters [in] Ireland. With both, con&s;tant intercour&s;es and communication <HI>is</HI> maintained.</P>
<P>"Do I hear &s;ome one cry, "Name them!" "Name them!" Lend me your patience and I will. Doubt not that they exi&s;t&mdash; for they are identified by unque&s;tionable evidence&mdash;that <HI>of an United Iri&s;hman!</HI> Who&s;o doubts the exi&s;tence of a directorial body, is a fool. Do you not &s;ee that they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of a body? do they not &s;ee? do they not read, do they not hear, do they not feel? or how is it that the fears we have excited have repre&s;&s;ed their daring, and &s;u&s;pended their appeal to the populace? <HI>"Con&s;ul vidit."</HI></P>
<P>"Let not the inhabitants of other towns &s;uppo&s;e, that they are
<PB N="24" REF="035272_0024_1001BA92D593D1A8">
free from the machinations of united Iri&s;hmen, becau&s;e Phila|delphia is the centre of their operations.</P>
<P>"In Baltimore there is a band called the "Republican com|pany," compo&s;ed to a man of united Iri&s;hmen; the&s;e, with the whole numerous body there, voted for the muddy-headed general, that &s;worn enemy to France, that foe to her &s;chemes, that "oppo&s;er of her power." Their uniform is completely French; and that thier principles are &s;o, will be doubted by no man who knows the <HI>real</HI> character of their political leader.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, their poi&s;on runs in every artery of our political body &mdash;it is diffu&s;ed over all the minute&s;t fibres of our frame. PUB|LICITY to their machinations, is the attempted remedy. Here <HI>I</HI> &s;tand in need of active co-operation. If other people do not choo&s;e to adopt my homely and untutored &s;tyle, let them utter the facts <HI>I</HI> bring to light in their own dre&s;s, or any other&mdash;at all events give them publicity. They &s;hould have a di&s;&s;emination as wide as the extent of the evil.

<P><PB N="25" REF="035272_0025_1001BA950DA27E68">But it &s;eems I was unacquainted with the extent of Mr. Fen|no's kindne&s;s. He had de&s;tined the fool&s;cap for my head, to keep it comfortably warm during the approaching winter. I here beg leave to pre&s;ent him my &s;incere acknowledgments, which I hope he will not mode&s;tly refu&s;e to accept. Let me, however, incidentally ob&s;erve, that I have known <HI>"fatuitous"</HI> printers&mdash;men who fancied them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e powers, but to whom the public, were it put to vote, would award the fool&s;cap. Take notice, reader, I prote&s;t again&s;t any mi&s;con&s;truction of my meaning. I do not a&s;&s;ert that Mr. John Ward Fenno, editor, proprietor, printer, and publi&s;her of the Gazette of the United States, or Philadelphia Daily Adverti&s;er, belongs to this cla&s;s. No, no, that would be an in&s;ult, and prove my want of di&s;cernment. But &s;hould the public, after a full in|ve&s;tigation of this alarmi&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, be pretty unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that it has been very <HI>"fatuitou&s;ly"</HI> managed, and, as a certain very ancient and indu&s;trious per&s;onage, nicknamed Bel|zebub, is reported to have declared, when he caught a hog, and &s;heared him, that there has been "great <HI>cry and little wool,</HI>" am I to blame, Mr. Fenno? Surely not.</P>
<P>This is rather digre&s;&s;ive. Let me re&s;ume the thread of my di&s;cour&s;e. The Gazette of the United States e&s;caped my ob&s;er|vation on Tue&s;day evening. A neighbour had borrowed, and neglected to return it. On Wedne&s;day, about dinner time, I was informed, that there was in it, a li&s;t of United Iri&s;hmen, and that among them my name was introduced. I &s;ent for the paper; and the reader may readily conceive my a&s;toni&s;hment at the <HI>"fatuitous"</HI> denou&euml;ment of a plot, which had threatened the exi&s;tence of the government, nay the very independence of the United States. It appeared that on the 26th of November, Mr. Fenno had had <HI>"a li&s;t"</HI> of the con&s;pirators&mdash;that he had &s;ince that time repeatedly and with a loud voice called for fur|ther communications&mdash;and lo! after three weeks corrections, additions, and emendations, the promi&s;ed li&s;t made its appear|ance, on the 18th of December, when there were brought for|ward, only

the&s;e mu&s;t be! every man of them at lea&s;t a Guy Faux! The cellars under Congre&s;s Hall, if any there be, ought to be carefully examined, left they be filled with combu&s;tible matters &mdash;perhaps, as Bob Acres judiciou&s;ly expre&s;&s;es it, with <HI>"double barreled &s;words and cut-and-thru&s;t pi&s;tols."</HI></P>
<P>To be &s;erious; other con&s;iderations &s;oon aro&s;e in my mind. I found my&s;elf held up to the world as <HI>"a Guy Faux,"</HI> a con&s;pirator, "ripe for rapine and &s;poil," by a young man to whom I never had given any cau&s;e of offence, and with whom I had had a long, though far from an intimate acquaintance. If at &s;uch a moment, I felt di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow &s;ome har&s;h epithets on him who had acted &s;o very unkindly towards me, I believe much cen|&s;ure would not attach to me. It would require a greater degree of patience than has fallen to the &s;hare of the <HI>"&s;puttering, fatu|itous Book&s;eller"</HI> not to vent his indignation in pretty expre&s;&s;ive terms.</P>
<P>To a man ambitious of being brought forward into public no|tice&mdash;of being con&s;picuous, the &s;ituation in which I was placed, might not be di&s;agreeable. But I was no Ero&s;tratus. The hum|ble, &s;eque&s;tered vale &s;uited me better. I therefore re&s;olved to wait upon Mr. Fenno, to inve&s;tigate the affair, and called upon a much-re&s;pected friend to accompany me, and be witne&s;s of what might occur.</P>
<P>Mr. F. was at home. I told him how &s;urprized and mortified I had been, to find my name introduced into his paper the prece|ding evening &s;o very indecently and unju&s;tly. He replied, he was not certain that my name was there. It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to expre&s;s what I felt at this &s;ubterfuge, which mu&s;t have reference to the quaint and new-found de&s;ignation of <HI>"Ma|thew Ditto,"</HI> which certainly was not Mathew Carey, although intended to convey and actually conveying tho&s;e names to the reader. This quibble was not ea&s;ily reconciled to the gratuit|ous and una&s;ked for proffer of the neck to the murderers' knives, on the 26th of November. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to render them con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>When I had &s;couted this idea, Mr. Fenno informed me he had acted in the affair merely as Editor, and, in the performance of his duty as &s;uch, "he could not an&s;wer whom <HI>he might fall foul of.</HI>" I replied he ought &s;urely to be very careful whom he <HI>fell foul of,</HI> in violation of truth and ju&s;tice; that in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, there was an equal di&s;regard of both; that I was no pro|per game for a new&s;paper, being a private citizen, and wholly ab&s;tracted from politics; that &s;hould I ever become a &s;uitable object of the &s;crutiny of new&s;paper Editors, I would not have any objection to be brought forward, being able and willing to

defend my&s;elf; and in fine, after a <HI>lengthy</HI> conver&s;ation (excu&s;e me, Mr. Cobbett, for the u&s;e of this word) I told him that his informant, whoever he might be, was a liar and a &s;coundrel; and that if the&s;e terms required any explanation, it might be &s;ought for and had at No. 118, Market Street.</P>
<P>I next day waited on Mr. Fenno with the following lines, which were publi&s;hed in his paper of Thur&s;day the 20th of De|cember:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Fenno,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your paper of ye&s;terday, after a column of virulent abu&s;e again&s;t United Iri&s;hmen, you have introduced my name among tho&s;e of &s;undry per&s;ons, who, your readers are given to under|&s;tand, are members of that a&s;&s;ociation; and thus, with equal de|cency, truth, and ju&s;tice, you make me a participator of the abu&s;e you &s;o freely be&s;tow. I am willing, Sir, to take your word, that you were not the compiler of the li&s;t, and that in the in&s;ertion of it, you acted merely as Editor, without pretending to vouch for its authenticity. But, Sir, let me a&s;k you, how can you recon|cile to your duty, as publi&s;her of a paper, to attack the character, attempt to injure the intere&s;t, and di&s;turb the peace of a fellow-citizen, without fully and &s;atisfactorily a&s;certaining the truth of the allegations you bring forward? From the very been &s;en&s;ibi|lity you formerly di&s;played, re&s;pecting &s;ome &s;trictures upon your father, I &s;hould have expected more tenderne&s;s for the feelings of others, than you have exerci&s;ed on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this lengthy exordium, I now declare unequivocally, that whoever informed you I am a Member of the Society of U|nited Iri&s;hmen, is a liar, unde&s;erving of confidence. If I do not apply any har&s;her epithets, it is not becau&s;e the writer does not richly de&s;erve them&mdash;but becau&s;e I think a decent regard for the public &s;hould forbid the u&s;e in a new&s;paper of &s;uch terms as his conduct merits. If the epithet I u&s;e, is too hard of dige&s;tion, he knows where to apply for a remedy. I never in the whole cour&s;e of my life attended a meeting of United Iri&s;hmen but once, and that was about eighteen months ago.</P>

<P>I might here di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, &s;o far as re&s;pects the Gazette of the United States. But two facts, connected with it, force them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly on my mind, that I think it would be ex|tremely unju&s;t and improper to omit them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that the ob&s;ervations immediately preceding the li&s;t, are delivered in the fir&s;t per&s;on &s;ingular, the &s;tile generally adopted by new&s;paper Editors, when they deliver their own ora|cular deci&s;ions. "<HI>I</HI> reque&s;ted Communications"&mdash;"Tho&s;e <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="035272_0028_1001BA9C097B46D0">
have received"&mdash;"Why &s;hould <HI>I</HI> publi&s;h a dozen of names?"&mdash; "<HI>I</HI> &s;ay, why &s;hould <HI>I</HI> in&s;ert in MY paper?" Even the very &s;lender covering of <HI>"a Corre&s;pondent ob&s;erves"</HI>&mdash;in Italic&mdash;or "COMMUNICATION," in capitals&mdash;u&s;ed by printers, when they choo&s;e to &s;hift the re&s;pon&s;ibility off their own &s;houlders, was not in this in&s;tance deemed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The other fact is, that two of the parties accu&s;ed, John Black and Samuel Park, having in the Gazette of the United States, of the 25th of December, publi&s;hed a contradiction of the charge of being United Iri&s;hmen, the former in a well writ|ten addre&s;s, and the latter under &s;olemn affidavit, Mr. Fenno &s;ubjoined to their publication the following lines, which he pro|bably con&s;idered as a complete refutation of all they had advan|ced:</P>
<P><Q>I hurl back in the teeth of the&s;e fellows every item of their abu&s;e. <HI>I have called neither of them an United Iri&s;hman.</HI> If I had, nothing they can &s;ay or do, would alter my opinions, re|&s;pecting them, their principles, or their purpo&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not a&s;k here&mdash;how can the &s;tile of the introductory pa|ragraphs be reconciled to the idea of mere editor&s;hip?&mdash;nor, if Mr. Fenno <HI>did not</HI> charge tho&s;e people with being United Iri&s;hmen, what charge <HI>did</HI> he bring again&s;t them, or for what conceivable purpo&s;e did he introduce their names into his pa|per?&mdash;The&s;e and many other que&s;tions might be a&s;ked, and co|pious comments added. But I tru&s;t I &s;hall have very few read|ers who will not admit, that the facts them&s;elves &s;corn the &s;up|port of comment, illu&s;tration, or argument.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Mr. Fenno a billet, in&s;i&s;ting on a di&s;avowal of the charge again&s;t me. To this he had not the decency to reply. Perhaps he did not know, or at lea&s;t con&s;ider at the moment, that few things can reflect more honour on a gentleman, than apology for injury, or retractation of error. Irritated by his &s;i|lence and neglect, I was di&s;po&s;ed to make application to a lawyer, and &s;ue him for damages. But di&s;liking the trouble attendant on it, and con&s;idering that one affair of the kind at a time, was enough on my hands, I abandoned the idea.</P>
<P>The reader who has honoured me with his attention thus far, mu&s;t have perceived, that I treat Mr. Fenno in a very different &s;tile from Cobbett. The rea&s;ons are obvious. The former has but once attempted to injure me&mdash;and the attempt, though a very flagrant one, might have ari&s;en from mi&s;information. He is moreover young and inexperienced. At his age, it is na|tural and &s;omewhat excu&s;able to carry more &s;ail than balla&s;t&mdash; to be more under the dominion of imagination, zeal, and enthu|&s;ia&s;m, than that of prudence and caution. The latter are gene|rally
<PB N="29" REF="035272_0029_1001BAA1F4A6C280">
the fruits of age and experience. Circum&s;tances, indeed, often accelerate their growth, previous to the cu&s;tomary period of maturity. And the pre&s;ent affair, trivial as it is, may afford Mr. Fenno, an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, which is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, that an overweening zeal, when not duly attempered by prudence, may &s;ometimes lead him into unplea&s;ant &s;ituations, from which it may be very difficult to e&s;cape, without making a very <HI>"fotuitous"</HI> fi|gure in the eyes of ob&s;ervers. He might have gone on for months with virulent and declamatory paragraphs again&s;t Uni|ted Iri&s;hmen, their "Golgothas," their "ma&s;&s;acres," their "car|nage, plunder, ravage, and throat-cuttings," till he had rendered them &s;o horrible, as to an&s;wer the &s;ame very u&s;eful purpo&s;e for American nur&s;es, that the dreadful Malbrouk did for tho&s;e u&s;eful ladies in France. But after &s;o many weeks of <HI>"dreadful note,"</HI> to bring forward a li&s;t of <HI>&s;eventeen per&s;ons,</HI> and per&s;ons too in &s;uch humble walks of life, was wor&s;e than even Edmund Burke's &s;ublime dagger &s;cene in the Hou&s;e of Commons. This ludi|crous li&s;t, among its other inconveniences, has furni&s;hed him with the comforts of a &s;nug &s;uit for damages, commenced by one of the parties, who, by the way, I am informed, is &s;trongly antigallican in his politics, and as much oppo&s;ed as Mr. Fenno, to United Iri&s;hmen.</P>
<P>But with Cobbett&mdash;with the infamous&mdash;with the abandoned Cobbett, who has been teizing me occa&s;ionally &s;ince the 5th of May 1797, and whom I have borne with a degree of patience that mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h the reader, as it does my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, what mea&s;ures could I be expected to ob&s;erve? Where find terms of reproach, of opprobrium, adequate to his turpitude, but by ran|&s;acking his own abominable works? Never, reader, never, &s;hould I have been able to collect the terms of vituperation I have u&s;ed, had I not engaged in a review of the publications of that black|guard.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Republication by Cobbett of the li&s;t from the Gazette of the United States, with Comments. A very mild and complimentary letter from M. Carey. Cobbett puzzled. No an&s;wer. Parody.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE opportunity afforded by the publication in the Gazette of the United States, was too favourable to be neglected by the mi&s;creant Cobbett. Accordingly, on Friday the 21&s;t of De|cember,
<PB N="30" REF="035272_0030_1001BAA41E55F5F0">
he republi&s;hed the li&s;t and my letter to Mr. Fenno, to which he prefixed the following comments:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>UNITED IRISHMEN.</HEAD>
<P>Among&s;t all the various dangers, which this country has to apprehend, the combination of a &s;et of men, who denominate them&s;elves <HI>United Iri&s;hmen,</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;erious. Their organi|zation is &s;o complete and &s;o exten&s;ive, and their objects are &s;o directly of a rebellious nature, that every power of government, and every exertion of individuals, &s;hould be made u&s;e of to defeat their projects.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenno has been very indu&s;trious in getting information on the &s;ubject. He has publi&s;hed a li&s;t of names, <HI>not, indeed, as the names of United Iri&s;hmen,</HI> but as di&s;affected Iri&s;hmen&mdash;Iri&s;h|men di&s;affected to the government of the United States.</P>
<P>I applaud Mr. Fenno's generous zeal in the cau&s;e of his country; but when he publi&s;hed his li&s;t, I looked upon it as <HI>premature,</HI> for certain rea&s;ons which no one could know but my&s;elf. I therefore did not copy his li&s;t into my paper; but, &s;ince <HI>threats</HI> have been thrown out again&s;t him, and &s;ince he has been actually <HI>a&s;&s;aulted,</HI> for this publication, I am determined to &s;how the De|mocratic crew, that there is at lea&s;t one man be&s;ides Mr. Fenno, who dares openly to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of a good government, in &s;pite of all the hell of Jacobini&s;m.</P>
<P>This li&s;t, trifling as it is, and though it does not charge any man with being an <HI>United Iri&s;hman,</HI> [what a lying villain!] threw the whole camp into confu&s;ion and uproar. The <HI>Careys</HI> have come forward with a denial, as will be &s;een by the following letters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>James Carey publi&s;hed in the Gazette of the United States, on the 20th of December, the following letter:&mdash;
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. FENNO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Being la&s;t night informed that you had mentioned my name in your paper of Tue&s;day as a member of the &s;ociety of United Iri&s;hmen, I am to reque&s;t you will give equal publicity to my refu|tation of a charge which is at once fal&s;e and malicious.</P>
<P>I &s;olemnly declare that I never was a member of the &s;ociety of United Iri&s;hmen, either in Ireland or this country; neither was I ever pre&s;ent at any of their meetings, nor even propo&s;ed as a mem|ber, to my knowlege. I think it nece&s;&s;ary, however, to mention that I do not make this declaration to remove any &s;uppo&s;ed odium which may be thought to attach to the members of that &s;ociety; for I be|lieve the motives and views of that a&s;&s;ociation to be equally laudable and virtuous&mdash;&s;o much &s;o, that I &s;hould not be deterred from becom|ing a member, nor from continuing if I had been one, by all the torrents of abu&s;e with which they have lately been honored. My principal view is to &s;hew the public how fal&s;e your information is with re&s;pect to that &s;ociety, even in what occurs almo&s;t under your very no&s;e; it is therefore rea&s;onable to conclude that your &s;tatements of the objects and proceedings of remote branches of that a&s;&s;ocia|tion mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be equally erroneous&mdash;much more, it appears, they could not be.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, Yours, &amp;c. JAMES CAREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P></NOTE> which I al&s;o take from Mr. Fenno's paper.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035272_0031_1001BAA88E0A4CA0">Thus we &s;ee that one brother acknowledges <HI>having been an United Iri&s;hman,</HI> and that the other thinks the <HI>motives</HI> and <HI>views</HI> of the a&s;&s;ociation to be <HI>laudable and virtuous.</HI> This is a very pret|ty way of convincing the public, <HI>that Mr. Fenno's information is fal&s;e!</HI> It is an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> way of doing it. It is well known (from the con&s;titution of this &s;ociety) that its objects are, to aid the rebels in Ireland, or (which is mo&s;t probable) to aid the French, if occa&s;ion &s;hould &s;erve, again&s;t the government of the United States; Each of the&s;e objects is equally ho&s;tile to the United States; and yet the Careys have the impudence to &s;ay that Mr. Fenno's in|formation is fal&s;e, when he cla&s;&s;es them among&s;t the <HI>di&s;affected Iri&s;h!!</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Matthew Ditto"</HI> (I have laughed at this a hundred times) Mathew Ditto &s;ays that he only <HI>attended</HI> a &s;ociety of United Iri&s;hmen. By a peru&s;al of their <HI>te&s;t</HI> and rules, it will appear, that he could not <HI>attend</HI> without being a member; and it will al&s;o ap|pear, from the &s;ame peru&s;al, that he could not cea&s;e to be a mem|ber, without breaking the &s;hocking oath of &s;ecrecy. The cere|monies of the compact are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame as tho&s;e of free|ma&s;onry. The horrid oath mu&s;t be broken, or the initiated &s;till remains a United Iri&s;hman.</P>
<P>I have little inclination to <HI>critici&s;e</HI> on a production of Ma|thew Carey's; but, methinks, that <HI>an author</HI> &s;hould know how to di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of &s;peech to which his words belong. Mathew fir&s;t calls the word <HI>liar</HI> an <HI>epithet,</HI> and in the next member of the &s;entence he calls it a <HI>term.</HI> Yet this man <HI>has been a vamper of geographies</HI> and a grinder of <HI>"Trifles in Pro&s;e."</HI> The&s;e poor trifles were the mo&s;t unfortunate in the world; for, though the fine&s;t attempt at the pro&s;aic bathos that I recollect to have &s;een, I do not believe that ten copies of them were ever &s;old. <HI>(The &s;crubby ra&s;cal tells a fal&s;ehood. The whole edition is &s;old except about ten copies.)</HI> The diminutive volume, like a premature chicken, peri&s;hed with the &s;hell on its head.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035272_0032_1001BAAAF7BBC6C8">But, if Mathew Ditto is de&s;titute of talents, he makes it up in &s;pitefulne&s;s. What bra&s;s mu&s;t a man have, to talk about <HI>the peace of his family being di&s;turbed,</HI> by his being &s;tiled a <HI>dis|affected Iri&s;hman,</HI> when, in the &s;ame paragraph, he aims a blow at a whole family of orphans, by alluding to what every one knows to be a ba&s;e and wicked accu&s;ation again&s;t their virtuous father! But the impudence of a Democrat is to be mea&s;ured by his malignity.</P>
<P>By the conclu&s;ion of Mathew's letter, he is, it &s;eems, as u&s;ual, <HI>full of fight.</HI> As it appears to be his intention to chal|lenge, Mr. Fenno will have a right to choo&s;e weapons: and, if I were Fenno, I would fight him with a <HI>pen.</HI> Then we &s;hall all enjoy the combat. As to any <HI>per&s;onal</HI> conflict between them, I hope that on the part of Fenno, it will always be carried on by <HI>the point of the &s;hoe.</HI></P>

<P>On a peru&s;al of his paper, I determined, again to renew my corre&s;pondence with him, but in a &s;tile extremely different in|deed from what I had before u&s;ed. He had complained that my letters were in&s;ipid. I re&s;olved whatever epithet he might be&s;tow upon this, that it &s;hould not de&s;erve that of <HI>"insipid."</HI> Accordingly, I gave full expre&s;&s;ion to the abomination and abhor|rence I felt for him, in a letter of which the following are the parts relative to him&s;elf, and which I &s;ent him on Sunday, the 23d December.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Part of the preceding letter is omitted. Some of it related to individuals, who are, by common fame, reported to be con|nected with Cobbett. Not having reduced to a certainty the information I received on the &s;ubject, I thought it would be unju&s;t and cruel to bring them forward till the fact was a&s;|certained.</P>
<P>This letter completely threw away the &s;cabbard. It was not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee what cour&s;e Cobbett would determine to &s;teer. Two plans &s;truck my mind, as likely to perplex him con&s;idera|bly which to pur&s;ue. One was, to publi&s;h the letter, and ac|company it with a di&s;charge of all the &s;tink pots, and other fetid and noi&s;ome matter that he could collect.&mdash;And of his powerful talents in this line, the world has had many con|vincing proofs. The other was, &s;neakingly to pocket the let|ter, and remain &s;ilent. When I con&s;idered the infernal rage and violence of his temper, with his native &s;tock of unblu&s;h|ing
<PB N="35" REF="035272_0035_1001BAB0B607CD68">
impudence, I was led to &s;u&s;pect the former. But on the other hand, the &s;hocking meanne&s;s, ba&s;ene&s;s and cowardice, he had &s;o frequently di&s;played, inclined me to look for the latter.</P>
<P>When I wrote this letter, I was nearly re&s;olved, if ever he again introduced my name into his Gazette, to publi&s;h pro|po&s;als directly for a paper, one main purpo&s;e of which &s;hould be to <Q>hang up him and his a&s;&s;ociates on the tenterhooks of infamy,</Q> as a &s;ort of <HI>mon&s;tra horrenda, in terrorem</HI> to other villains like him, if any &s;uch can be found. But after mature con&s;ideration, I felt a &s;trong di&s;inclination to recur to this &s;tep, <HI>except as a dernier re&s;ort.</HI> I thought it better to defer it as long as po&s;&s;ible, determined it &s;hould be forced on me, like the pre|&s;ent appeal. Whenever it happens, it will not be a matter of choice. But the later it comes, abandoned profligate. Cob|bett! the more &s;ignal will be its effects upon you. This is but a trifling &s;pecimen of what you are to receive.</P>
<P>The trouble and anxiety attendant on a paper are very con|&s;iderable&mdash;its interference with my other bu&s;ine&s;s would pro|duce very great inconvenience.&mdash;There is, moreover, a &s;trong objection to a new&s;paper, as many new&s;papers are carried on in this country, which renders the editor&s;hip of one, a &s;evere and painful ta&s;k to a man of any liberality of mind.&mdash; In England, Ireland, and Scotland, the editors of new&s;papers, con&s;ider and treat each other, reciprocally as gentlemen.&mdash; Although the colli&s;ion of political opinions there is at lea&s;t equal to what prevails here, and although the printers and wri|ters &s;upport the parties they e&s;pou&s;e with the utmo&s;t ardour, &s;till, like the gentlemen of the bar, they ob&s;erve, generally &s;peak|ing, the rules of decorum and decency towards their adver|&s;aries. The deviations from this rule are few, and entail di&s;|honour on tho&s;e who are guilty of them. In fact, the printers are &s;eldom the &s;ubject of attack. Opinions, principles, and &s;y&s;tems are oppo&s;ed and defamed, or &s;upported and defended; but, rarely, if ever, does it occur that the publi&s;hers of tho&s;e opinions, principles, or &s;y&s;tems, are vilified and abu&s;ed. We fondly copy from England. Would to heaven, for &s;ake of the national character, that this decent, this honourable, this gen|tlemanly cu&s;tom was tran&s;planted among us. Here, the black|guard's vocabulary is exhau&s;ted to collect terms of reproach to heap upon editors, printers, and publi&s;hers. And, <Q>O &s;hame! where is thy blu&s;h!</Q> even when the editor&s;hip of a Gazette devolves, by the death of a hu&s;band, on a helple&s;s widow, beings who call them&s;elves men, and who feel proud of the privi|leges of the name, forgetful of that re&s;pect for the &s;ex, which the untutored Indian in &s;ome degree feels, a&s;&s;ail, with coar&s;e

He did not, however, choo&s;e either of the plans I had anticipated.

<P>"No man will doubt that the objects of the combination [of the United Iri&s;hmen] are of the mo&s;t wicked, and bloody nature; but if any one were inclined to doubt this, I think the fiercene&s;s with which the Careys came forward to repel what they con&s;ider as a charge of belonging to the &s;ociety, mu&s;t produce conviction in the minds of the mo&s;t incredulous; for how &s;editious, how dangerous, how dete&s;table mu&s;t be the prin|ciples and views of a &s;ociety, which a fellow of Mathew Carey's politics thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to for&s;wear."</P>
<P>This teizing kind of attack rendered it difficult for me to decide what ground to a&s;&s;ume.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Cur&s;ory Ob&s;ervations, on the cau&s;e of Cobbet's Spite and Malice. Iri&s;hmen. National Prejudices. Liberality.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>It has frequently &s;truck me with &s;urpri&s;e, wherefore has the villain Cobbett, manife&s;ted &s;uch an infuriate hatred again&s;t me. I have exerted my&s;elf to a&s;certain the motive, and believe I have at length di&s;covered it. I am by birth an Iri&s;hman. And feeling the prejudices which the vulgar and low bred among his countrymen entertain for the people of other countries, he can never forgive me the &s;in of being a native of Ireland. That Engli&s;hmen of education are above this di&s;graceful prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, I am proud to acknowledge. But they mu&s;t confe&s;s, and many of them have done &s;o to me, that the canaille of their countrymen, &s;uch as Cobbett, are more under the influence of it, than the canaille of any other country whatever.</P>
<P>Yes, I am an Iri&s;hman by birth&mdash;although I am a citizen of the United States, by re&s;idence and by a full compliance with all the regulations and conditions devi&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. The former title I deem as valuable as the latter. I &s;ee nothing in the hi&s;tory of my country to render me a&s;hamed of her&mdash;
<PB N="39" REF="035272_0039_1001BAB755BF6200">
and I tru&s;t &s;he &s;hall never be a&s;hamed of me. Ireland! Ireland! country eminently ble&s;t by nature with almo&s;t every advantage that heaven in its utmo&s;t kindne&s;s could be&s;tow, of &s;ituation, rivers, bays, in&s;ularity, robu&s;tne&s;s of natives, fertility of &s;oil, and mildne&s;s of climate, but, for centuries, cur&s;ed with the harde&s;t fortune, when I forget or de&s;pi&s;e thee, when I cea&s;e to rejoice in your &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and weep over your mi&s;eries,

<L>"Upon the barren, wild, and de&s;olate wa&s;te,</L>
<L>"Feed on my &s;ighs, and drink my falling tears."</L></Q></P>
<P>Let vulgar, illiberal &s;ouls, whether they "&s;trut in ermine or brocade"&mdash;or are <HI>"&s;tuck o'er with titles,"</HI> di&s;grace them|&s;elves by ca&s;ting national reflections on the natives of Ireland. [Nothing can add to the meanne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch con|duct, except its being, as it is &s;ometimes, practi&s;ed by children of Iri&s;hmen.] Let them, to an&s;wer their contracted purpo&s;es, forget or pretend to forget that honour, virtue, truth and hone&s;ty, are "of no country"&mdash;that <Q>in every country, he that worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted of God</Q> and ought to be equally &s;o of man&mdash;Let them mark their preferences and attachments, as well as their rejections and hatreds, by the "geographical di&s;tinctions of birth"&mdash;and with 'micro&s;copic eye' trace the map to a&s;certain whether a man is upright or wicked.</P>

<L>"It keeps my body &s;o."</L></Q>
<P>If Cobbett was not a ba&s;e hind, the attachment an Iri&s;hman feels for his country, would excite his e&s;teem. He is an Eng|li&s;hman. For England he feels, or affects to feel an enthu&s;ia&s;|tic affection. Why &s;hould he not &s;uffer Iri&s;hmen to be actu|ated by the &s;ame motives? Why &s;hall a line of conduct, on which he &s;o highly prides him&s;elf, be di&s;reputable or di&s;honour|able in another man?</P>
<P>His &s;ordid, wretched mind, incapable of appreciating the force of tho&s;e liberal motives, pur&s;ues the Iri&s;h nation with in|fernal malice. Whenever he introduces them into his abomi|nable paper, he &s;eems to labour to invent new terms of reproach to appea&s;e his direful rage.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="035272_0040_1001A193D2ED0050">There is one circum&s;tance alone, which has made me almo&s;t a&s;hamed of being an Iri&s;hman&mdash;That is, the tamene&s;s and pu&s;il|lanimity with which &s;o many of my countrymen have &s;ubmitted to the abu&s;e of the vagabond! How many of them are in this city, at lea&s;t equally &s;trong and powerful with this ruffian! Where is their re&s;olution, where their courage, to allow him to pa&s;s with impunity! Could they perform a greater act of ju&s;tice, or render a more acceptable &s;ervice to their in&s;ulted country, than by promoting the circulation of his blood with a good do&s;e of &s;hillelah, admini&s;tered with due vigour? A vuarter of the &s;pirit that many of them have di&s;played in their own country to procure &s;atisfaction for &s;ome imaginary offence, would have been &s;ufficient, to &s;trike a damp into his inmo&s;t &s;oul&mdash;and made
<Q><L>"A deadly fear o'er all his vitals reign,</L>

<P>But there is one thing more infamous, if po&s;&s;ible, than the patience with which the abu&s;e of the &s;coundrel is borne. That is, that there are Iri&s;hmen degenerate enough to be found among the &s;ub&s;cribers of a blackguard ru&s;&s;ian, who&s;e chief &s;tudy &s;eems to be, to heap abu&s;e and infamy on their country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Petite guerre on the part of Cobbett&mdash;A very valuable hint to increa&s;e the revenue ari&s;ing from the po&s;t-office.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>It is obvious, that the intercour&s;e between Cobbett and me, as &s;tated in Chap. V. appeared in the eyes of the world to give him the advantage. It is true, I was pouring red-hot balls into his works, which were rapidly demoli&s;hing them, and that in re|turn he only kept up a &s;mall fire of mu&s;ketry, of little importance. But there was this difference in his favour&mdash;my cannonade was unperceived by the public&mdash;while his was daily &s;pread abroad in his <HI>"dirty di&s;h-clout."</HI> Affairs could not long remain in this &s;itu|ation. My patience, &s;o often tried, was nearly exhau&s;ted. I had made &s;acrifices enough for &s;ake of quiet. I felt humbled to &s;ub|mit &s;o long to a wretch&mdash;the vile&s;t of the vile. The cup of my indignation and re&s;entment was brimful. A &s;ingle drop would make it overflow. Still it required further provocation to over|come the extreme reluctance I felt to tre&s;pa&s;s on the public.
<PB N="41" REF="035272_0041_1001BAC0876B6DE8">
The mi&s;creant, mea&s;uring me by him&s;elf, mi&s;took my motives. He thought, after what I had borne, that he might continue his <HI>petite guerre</HI> with impunity. This would lead any per&s;on to whom I might &s;hew the letters I &s;ent him, to &s;uppo&s;e he had gained the victory.</P>
<P>In his paper of Saturday the 5th of June, he publi&s;hed the following paragraph, which, though not &s;o atrocious as &s;ome he had previou&s;ly printed, was the over-flowing drop.&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Sans-culottes, in general, are mo&s;t mortally grieved at the news lately come to had. But, what mu&s;t be the &s;hame, the confu&s;ion, the infernal torments, of the <HI>Sans-culotte Iri&s;h!</HI> I would not exchange &s;ituations with &s;uch a man as <HI>Reynolds</HI> or <HI>Clytus Carey</HI> for only one hour, for all the riches of the world; for I am &s;ure I &s;hould become my own executioner before half the hour were out."</P>
<P>The latter part of this paragraph demands a few ob&s;ervations. It proves, if any further proof were nece&s;&s;ary, that Cobbett is either a liar or a hypocrite, or both. His papers almo&s;t daily abound with the mo&s;t pious and &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ious of his veneration for Chri&s;ti|anity. To read &s;ome of the&s;e phari&s;aical effu&s;ions, any per&s;on, who did not know what a villain he was, would be tempted to think him a &s;aint, pre&s;erved in exi&s;tence to reclaim a &s;inful world from its wicked ways. But in what part of the Bible, or in what part of the conduct of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, does he find any coun|tenance for the horrid crime of &s;uicide&mdash;&s;elf-murder?&mdash;<HI>"I &s;hould become my own executioner before half the hour were out."</HI> Unfor|tunately, there is no &s;uch happine&s;s in &s;tore for mankind. It is not to be hoped or expected that he will &s;pare the hangman an office, which he has owed him the&s;e four years. The craven coward would not have nerve enough to perform this act of ju&s;|tice, the only reparation he can make for his manifold crimes.</P>
<P>The term "Clytus Carey," may require a little explanation, Cobbett, in the efferve&s;cence of his in&s;olence and impudence, had attempted to cover with his &s;lime Mr. Hopkin&s;on, a lawyer, who&s;e politics are highly, federal. This attack, with that on General Mar&s;hall, and other federali&s;ts, irritated &s;everal gentle|men, who had been his patrons, and been highly &s;atisfied, while he vented his abu&s;e on their political enemies alone. But as &s;oon as he began to vilify their friends, they &s;hrewdly found our, what had appeared obvious enough long before, that he was a &s;coundrel. Accordingly a writer in the Philadelphia Gazette, under the &s;ignature of Clytus, bombarded the poor devil &s;o com|pletely as to make him repent his temerity. Here he proved him|&s;elf as complete a ra&s;cal as he had ever done before. A friend
<PB N="42" REF="035272_0042_1001A1710E5E0638">
&s;tepped in to defend him, and was in con&s;equence &s;everely han|dled by Clytus. Cobbett, like a &s;neaking, paltry fellow, aban|doned him to Clytus, and never dared reply, either to defend that friend or him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mark the artifice of the villain. To di&s;arm the writings of "Clytus" of their force with federali&s;ts, he in&s;inuates that they were written by me, an avowed enemy of his politics! Poor, mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge, worthy of &s;uch a poor mi&s;erable &s;coundrell On Mr. Brown, printer of the Philadelphia Gazette, I call to te&s;tify that I never wrote a line or word of Clytus.</P>
<P>As many per&s;ons have in vain ordered Cobbett to di&s;|continue the papers he &s;ends them, I take this opportunity to furni&s;h them gratis with an infallible receipt to oblige him to keep his "di&s;h-clout" at home, and to increa&s;e the po&s;t office revenues. Let them fold up his papers carefully, put them under cover of a large and heavy &s;heet of writing paper, direct them to William Cobbett, Philadelphia, and put them into the po&s;t-office. They will be decently brought back to him as letters &mdash;and co&s;t him a quarter dollar, half a dollar, or three quar|ters each, according to the di&s;tance. He will then re&s;cue them from the di&s;grace of receiving the paper, in order to &s;ave the ex|pence of po&s;tage. <HI>Probatum e&s;t.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Cobbett's literary frauds. Beauties of Porcupine. Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>That Cobbett is an unprincipled villain, is too well known to require any illu&s;tration or enforcement. But how gro&s;s and in|famous are his mi&s;repre&s;entations, few people know, as very few readers of new&s;papers take the trouble of comparing quotations and extracts with the originals whence they are pretended to be drawn. But the following in&s;tance will &s;atisfy every man, how &s;uperlative a &s;coundrel he is.</P>
<P>In the Commercial Adverti&s;er, publi&s;hed by Mr. Noah Web|&s;ter, of New-York, there appeared on the 8th of July 1798, a <HI>"lengthy"</HI> paragraph, which Cobbett republi&s;hed on the 11th of the &s;ame month.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Porcupine's Gazette, No. 419, page 3, column 1.</NOTE> Part of it follows:</P>
<P><Q>It would &s;eem as if <HI>England</HI> and France could never for|give us, for being an independent and a happy people; and as
<PB N="43" REF="035272_0043_1001BAC414A21AC0">
we may pre&s;ume that Providence is on our &s;ide, we defy all <HI>their</HI> impotent and impious attempts to check his views, to lead us kindly by the hand to a &s;tate of inevitable pro&s;perity and happine&s;s as yet unknown on earth. Previous to our re|volution, <HI>the Briti&s;h in&s;ulted us</HI> by emptying all their <HI>condemned convicts</HI> on our &s;hores&mdash;We &s;upplicated in vain to prevent it; but mark the finger of Heaven&mdash;<HI>mo&s;t of the&s;e very men entered into the American army and the greater part of them peri&s;hed fighting valiantly for the liberty of America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Two days afterwards, the 13th of that month,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Porcupine's Gazette, No. 421, page 2, column 3.</NOTE> Cobbett vo|mited forth again&s;t Mr. Web&s;ter, a torrent of the foule&s;t abu&s;e: and, unparalleled effrontery! in quoting his words, he &s;tates them as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Noah Web&s;ter in&s;i&s;ts that the heroes who fell in defence of American freedom, were, in great part, compo&s;ed of the con|victs whom Great-Britain emptied on the&s;e &s;hores.</Q></P>
<P>Reader, to whatever party or country you belong, whether you are Engli&s;hman or Iri&s;hman, Scotchman or Dutchman, fede|i&s;t or antifederali&s;t, ari&s;tocrat or democrat, if you are an hone&s;t man, lay your hand on your heart, and pronounce &s;entence on this fraud. Mark well the difference between the idea convey|ed by Mr. Web&s;ter and that forced on him by his vile commen|tator. The former is correct. Many men, convicted in Eng|land of &s;light offences, and tran&s;ported to this country, have re|formed their lives, (and, great a ra&s;cal as Cobbett is, even he may reform) and become u&s;eful and exemplary citizens. Some of the fir&s;t offices in this country, when its purity of morals and manners was equal to that of any country under the canopy of heaven, have been filled by &s;uch men. Of this no man, but an ignoramus, can pretend to doubt. And the &s;tatement of the fact could give no offence to any rational American.</P>
<P>But Cobbett's infamous po&s;ition, <Q>that the heroes who fell in defence of American freedom, were in great part compo&s;ed of the convicts whom Great Britain emptied on the&s;e &s;hores,</Q> is a mo&s;t mon&s;trous and abominable fal&s;hood; and had Mr. Web|&s;ter or any other man, made &s;uch a declaration, he would have merited to be &s;ent out of New-York, as I hope to &s;ee Cobbett &s;ent out of Philadelphia, with di&s;grace and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>I have not done with this infamous bu&s;ine&s;s. Cobbett's "di&s;h|clout" is the &s;ole vehicle to convey intelligence to many parts of the union. On his pages hundreds of citizens depend &s;olely for information. What precious information it mu&s;t be, pa&s;&s;ing through &s;uch a foul, corrupted channel, and from &s;uch a ra&s;cally &s;ource! Will any man be <HI>"fatuitous"</HI> and mad enough to de|pend
<PB N="44" REF="035272_0044_1001BAC6A7259370">
upon the foreign intelligence of a villain who mi&s;quotes, <HI>in two days,</HI> articles republi&s;hed <HI>in his own paper!</HI> In fact, there is no correct news to be had from Porcupine's Gazette. The quantity of dome&s;tic lies and &s;currility he publi&s;hes, leaves little room for foreign information. What he does introduce, is al|ways &s;o garbled, and &s;o intermingled with his own di&s;gu&s;ting comments, that without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other paper, no man can conceive a correct idea of the real &s;tate of affairs.</P>
<P>Some months &s;ince, a ve&s;&s;el arrived at Norfolk, which brought recent intelligence from Europe. The Norfolk printers publi&s;hed a &s;upplement of near a column in length, which was brought to this city on Sunday morning. Cobbett received a copy of it. Short as it was, the whole did not &s;uit his views. He omitted about a third&mdash;that is to &s;ay, all that he wi&s;hed not to be true. Mr. Bradford likewi&s;e received a copy, and publi&s;hed it com|plete. The fraud was di&s;covered&mdash;and the villain &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now, reader, I do not pretend that two news-printers are to be expected to make the &s;ame &s;election from the &s;ame file of papers. By no means. The extreme diver&s;ity of talents, views, and wi&s;hes, will inevitably lead them to vary their entertain|ment. While &s;uch a wretch as Cobbett, fills his columns, with unmeaning chit-chat from the London papers, and other matter, equally unintere&s;ting to his readers, an intelligent, enlightened editor will &s;elect tho&s;e important articles calculated to inform the public of the &s;tate of affairs, at this momentous cri&s;is. For &s;elections &s;o trivial as I have &s;tated, I blame not Cob|bet. That he is unqualified for the weighty, important, and very influential office of editor of a gazette, in his misfortune and that of the public&mdash;but is no crime.

<P>Reader, I have turned four commas at the beginning of each line of the above paragraph, in order to prove to you that it is an extract from the works of William Cobbett, ex-corpo|ral in his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. It is none of my manu|facture; it is to be found in the fir&s;t volume of the works of that learned gentleman, beating the following lines in the title page&mdash;
<Q>PHILADELPHIA, <HI>Printed by WILLIAM YOUNG, for</HI> WILLIAM COBBETT OPPOSITE CHRIST'S CHURCH, &mdash;1797.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This title page, take notice, is at page 89 of the volume &mdash;and the extract, above emphatically marked with four com|mas, about the Engli&s;h&mdash;and their i&s;land&mdash;truth&mdash;and the devil &mdash;and all the re&s;t of it, is to be found in page 155&mdash;which, being interpreted, means, in the vulgar tongue, one hundred and fifty-five.</P>
<P>The following quotations are unfit for female eyes to &s;ee, or female ears to hear. I therefore print them in hieroglyphics, which the ladies, if any deign to read the&s;e pages, cannot, I hope, decypher.</P>

<P>A per&s;on brought forward on oath a heinous charge again&s;t Cobbett, who refuted the whole by the following logical proof of his innocence: <Q>The vagabond, at this moment, looks like a carca&s;s newly dropped from the gallows. He is ragged, dir|ty, lou&s;y-looking, and &s;tinking. He is a walking dunghill; a na&s;ty compound of all hues; in his per&s;on; and, in his character, he is a rebel, a &s;ponge-paying debtor, and a &s;cape-gallows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will not deba&s;e my&s;elf by oppo&s;ing my <HI>bare word</HI> to the oath of &s;uch a villain as this is. To &s;ay who and what he is, and who are his connexions, is enough. Tho&s;e who want more from me, are informed that I de&s;pi&s;e their opinions.</Q></P>
<P>* * * * * * *</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t learned, as this la&s;t half &s;heet is going to pre&s;s, that Cobbett threatens to a&s;&s;ault me in the &s;treets, for the libel which, he &s;ays, I am about to publi&s;h, and of which &s;ome of his &s;pies have gained information, by pimping in the printing office employed on the work. So then! the villain who has for years blackguarded whom he plea&s;ed, and when remon&s;trated with, in&s;i&s;ted on his right to exerci&s;e the liberty of the pre&s;s, winces at the <HI>lex talionis</HI>&mdash;and wi&s;hes to debar <HI>me</HI> of what he calls the liberty <HI>of the pre&s;s.</HI> Very good, ma&s;ter Cobbett, very good! So you can feel, as well as your neighbours! This is charming. You &s;hall, like <HI>Perillus,</HI> try the tortures you have &s;o long impudently and wickedly inflicted. It has been amu&s;ement to you, to <HI>ra&s;cal and &s;coundrel</HI> every body whom you di&s;liked&mdash;but you do not find it very amu&s;ing to be <HI>ra&s;called and &s;coundreled</HI> in turn. You mu&s;t, as the blackguards, your a&s;&s;ociates, &s;ay, <HI>grin and bear it.</HI> Do not, however, get into a pa&s;&s;ion too &s;oon. Wait a little, till you and your &s;coundrelly prompter &s;ee what a rod is in &s;oke for you both. Then be angry as &s;oon as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Cowards and ra&s;cals are dangerous enemies. I would, <HI>there|fore,</HI> rather have a conte&s;t of any &s;ort whatever, with ten gen|tlemen, than with one Cobbett. But &s;hould he a&s;&s;ume courage enough to attempt to put his threats into execution, I &s;hall

be prepared for the villain, and "by the beard of Pharaoh" I &s;hall give him as warm a reception as in my power. Should there be, on the &s;ettlement of accounts, any balance in his favour, which I cannot my&s;elf pay, if I can for one hundred dollars procure as great a ruffian, &s;coundrel and blackguard as him|&s;elf, [and though it will be difficult to find his equal, yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible] to di&s;charge the debt with a good &s;mart hic|kory &s;tick, may di&s;grace and infamy be my portion, if I do not chearfully pay the &s;um, and ri&s;k the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>&dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger; &dagger;</P>
<P>An old rancorous wretch, Cobbett's pimp and pander, talks too of law-&s;uits. If I am &s;ued for any thing contained in this pamphlet, I &s;hall make no other defence, than to lay be|fore the judge and jury the provocations I have experienced. I &s;hall not in&s;ult Philadelphia by &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible to find in it a jury capable of granting a verdict for a libel in favour of this prince of libellers and &s;landerers.</P>
<P>Let this &s;anctified &s;inner beware. He knows that I am in his debt, and as able as willing to pay. He may purcha&s;e an exemption by crawling within his hole, and remaining in ob&s;curity. But if he provokes me to drag him forward, <Q>like Cucus from his den</Q> [old gentleman, don't you remember this?] he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he will rival Porcupine in celebrity in a very &s;hort time.</P>

<P>And now, reader, of whatever cla&s;s; nation, or de&s;cription you are&mdash;whatever political principles you profe&s;s&mdash;if you are a good and virtuous man, I &s;olemnly call upon you&mdash;Friend of public ta&s;te; come forward, and di&s;countenance a wretch who&s;e paper has already depraved the ta&s;te of the public! Friend of &s;ocial harmony, withdraw your patronage from an incendiary who uniformly labours to produce confu&s;ion!
