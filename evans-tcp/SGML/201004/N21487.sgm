<HEAD>THE Rea&s;on of this work.</HEAD>
<P>IN that &s;hort acquaintance I had with that Re|verend learned &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her,</HI> he has often, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, been importuning me to write a Directory for the &s;everal ranks of profe&s;&s;|ed Chri&s;tians, which might di&s;tinctly give each one their portion; beginning with the Unconverted, and then proceeding to the babes in Chri&s;t and then to the Strong, and mixing &s;ome &s;pecial helps again&s;t the &s;everal &s;ins that they are addicted to. By the &s;uddenne&s;s of his motion at our fir&s;t congre&s;s, I per|ceived it was on his mind before: and I told him, both that it was abundantly done by many already, and that his unacquaintedne&s;s with my weakne&s;s, might make him think me fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter for it than I was. But this did not &s;atisfy him but &s;till he made it his reque&s;t. I confe&s;s I was not moved by his rea&s;ons, nor did I apprehend any great need of doing more than is done in that way: nor that I was likely to do more: And therefore I parted from him with|out the lea&s;t purpo&s;e to an&s;wer his de&s;ire. But &s;ince his death his words often came into my mind, and the great reverence I bore him, did the more in|cline me to think with &s;ome complacency of his motion. And having of late intended to write a
<PB N="iv" REF="028243_0003_0FD74636D0329758">Family Directory, I began to apprehend how con|gruou&s;ly the forementioned work &s;hould lead the way; and the &s;everal conditions of men's &s;ouls be &s;poken of, before we come to the &s;everal relations. Here|upon I re&s;olved, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to proceed in in order following:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To &s;peak to the Impenitent Unconverted &s;inners, who are not yet &s;o much as purpo&s;ing to turn, or at lea&s;t are not &s;etting about the work. And with the&s;e I thought a wakening per&s;ua&s;ive was a more nece&s;&s;ary means than mere directions. For di|rections &s;uppo&s;e men willing to obey them: but the per&s;ons we have fir&s;t to deal with, are wilful and faft a&s;leep in &s;in, and as men that are pa&s;t feeling, having given them&s;elves over to &s;in with greedine&s;s, Eph. iv. 19. My next work mu&s;t be for tho&s;e that have &s;ome purpo&s;es to turn, and are about the work, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o direct for a thorough and true conver&s;ion that they mi&s;carry not in the birth. The third part mu&s;t be directions, for the younger and weaker &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, that they may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, built up and per&s;evere. The forth part, Directions for lap|&s;ed and back&s;liding Chri&s;tians, for their &s;afe reco|very. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is intended &s;ome Per&s;ua|&s;ions and Directions again&s;t &s;ome &s;pecial errors of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he times, and again&s;t &s;ome common killing &s;ins; as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or directions to doubting troubled con&s;ciences, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s done already. And the &s;trong I &s;hall not write directions for, becau&s;e they are &s;o much taught in God already. And then the la&s;t part is intended more e&s;pecially for Families; as &s;uch, directing the &s;everal Relations in their Duty; &s;ome of the&s;e are already written; whether I &s;hall have life and lei|&s;ure for the re&s;t, God only knoweth. And there|fore I publi&s;h the &s;everal parts by them&s;elves as I write them: and the rather becau&s;e they are intend|ed for men of different &s;tates, and becau&s;e I would
<PB N="v" REF="028243_0003_0FD74636D0329758">not deter them by the bulk or price, from reading what is written for their benefit.</P>
<P>The u&s;e that this part is publi&s;hed for is, 1. For Ma&s;ters and Parents to read often in their Families, if they have &s;ervants or children that are yet un|converted. 2. For all &s;uch unconverted per&s;ons to read and con&s;ider of them&s;elves. 3. For the richer &s;ort that have any pity for &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;ouls, to give to the un&s;anctified that need them, (if they have not &s;itter at hand to u&s;e or give.)</P>
<P><HI>The Lord awaken us to work, while it is day, for the &s;aving of our own and others &s;ouls, in &s;ub&s;er|viency to the Ble&s;&s;ed God, the Maker, the Redeemer, and the Sanctifier of Souls.</HI></P>

<P>Say unto them, As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael?</P></Q>

</LIST>
<P>Having laid the text open before your eyes in the&s;e plain propo&s;itions, I &s;hall next &s;peak &s;ome|what of each of them in order, though very briefly.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>Doct. 1.</HI> It is the unchangeable Law of God, that wicked men mu&s;t turn or die.</HEAD>
<P>IF you will believe God, believe this; There is but one of the&s;e two ways for every wicked man, either conver&s;ion or damnation; I know the wick|ed will hardly be per&s;uaded either of the truth or equity of this: No wonder, if the guilty quarrel with the law. Few men are apt to believe that which they would not have to be true, and fewer would have that to be true which they apprehend to be again&s;t them. But it is not quarrelling with the law, or with the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge that will &s;ave the malefactor; believing and regarding the law might have prevented
<PB N="10" REF="028243_0006_0FD746414D2A73F0">his death, but denying and accu&s;ing it will but ha&s;ten it. If it were not &s;o an hundred would bring their <HI>rea&s;on again&s;t</HI> the law, for one that would bring his rea&s;on to the law, and men would rather choo&s;e to give their rea&s;ons why they &s;hould not be pun|i&s;hed than to hear the commands and rea&s;ons of their governors which require them to obey. The law was not made for you to judge, but that you might be ruled and judged by it.</P>
<P>But if there be any &s;o blind as to venture to que&s;|tion either the truth or the ju&s;tice of this Law of God, I &s;hall briefly give you tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evidence of both: which, methinks, &s;hould &s;atisfy a rea&s;onable man.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if you doubt whether thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be the word of God or not, be&s;ides an hundred other texts, you may be &s;atisfied by the&s;e few. &mdash; Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, xviii. 3. 'Verily I &s;ay unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' John iii. 3. 'Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, Except a man be born again, he can|not &s;ee the kingdom of God, 2 Cor. v. 17, If a man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new Creature: Old things are pa&s;t away, behold all thing are become new. Col. iii. 9.10. 'Ye have put off the old man with his deed', and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him. Heb. xii. 14. 'Without holine&s;s none &s;hall &s;ee God,' Rom. viii. 8.9. 'So then they that are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God. Now if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.' Gal vi. 15. 'For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her cir|cumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a new creature.' 1 Pet. i. 3. 'According to his abundant grace he hath begotten us to lively hope. Ver. 23. 'Being born again, not of corrup|tible &s;eed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.' 1 Pet. ii. 1, 2. 'Wherefore laying a&s;ide all malice, and all

<P>As I need not &s;tay to open the&s;e texts, which are &s;o plain, &s;o I think I need not add any more of that multitude which &s;peak the like. If thou be a man that do&s;t believe the word of God, here is al|ready enough to &s;atisfy thee, that the wicked mu&s;t be Converted or Condemned. You are already brought &s;o far, that you mu&s;t either confe&s;s that this is true, or &s;ay plainly, you will not believe the word of God. And if once you be come to that pa&s;s, there is but &s;mall hopes of you, look to your&s;elves as well as you can, for it is like you will not be long out of hell. You would be ready to fly in the face of him that &s;hould give you the lie; and yet dare you give the lie to God? But if you tell God plainly you will not believe him, blame him not if he never warn you more, or if he for&s;ake you, and give you up as hopele&s;s; for to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he warn you, if you will not believe him? Should he &s;end an angel from heaven to you, it &s;eems you would not believe. For an angel can &s;peak but the Word of God; and if an angel &s;hould bring you any other go&s;pel you are not to rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve it, but to hold him accur&s;ed. Gal. i. 8. And &s;urely there is no angel to be believed before the Son of God, who came from the Father to bring us this doctrine. If he be not to be believed, then all the angels in heaven are not to be believed. And if you &s;tand on the&s;e terms with God, I &s;hall leave you till he deal with you in a more convincing way. God hath a voice that will make you hear. Though he entreat you to hear the voice of his go&s;pel, he will make you hear the voice of his condemning &s;entence,
<PB N="12" REF="028243_0007_0FD74644A6A9B868">without intreaty: We cannot make you believe again&s;t your wills; But God will make you feel a|gain&s;t your wills.</P>
<P>But let us hear, what rea&s;on you have, why will you not believe his Word of God, which tells us that the wicked mo&s;t be <HI>Converted or Condemned?</HI> I know your rea&s;on, it is becau&s;e that you judge it unlikely that God &s;hould be &s;o unmerciful; you think it cruelty to da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> men everla&s;tingly for &s;o &s;mall a thing as a &s;inful life. And this leads us up to the &s;econd thing, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ju&s;tify the equity of God in his laws and judgments.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I think you will not deny but that it is mo&s;t &s;uitable to an immortal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oul, to be ruled by laws that promi&s;e an immortal toward and threaten an endle&s;s puni&s;hment.

<P N="2">2. I &s;uppo&s;e that you will confe&s;s that the <HI>pro|mi&s;e</HI> of an endle&s;s and inconceivable glory is not in&s;uitable to the wi&s;dom of God, or the ca&s;e of man: And why then &s;hould you not think &s;o of the <HI>threatening</HI> of an endle&s;s and un&s;peakabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mi|&s;ery!</P>

Mu&s;t the God of Heaven come to &s;chool to you to learn wi&s;dom? Mu&s;t infinite wi&s;dom learn of fol|ly, and infinite Goodne&s;s be corrected by a &s;wini&s;h &s;inner, that cannot keep him&s;elf an hour clean? Mu&s;t the Almighty &s;tand at the bar of a worm? Oh horrid arrogancy of &s;en&s;ele&s;s du&s;t! &s;hall ever mole, or clod, or dunghill, accu&s;e the &s;un of darkne&s;s, and undertake to illuminate the world? Where were you when the Almighty made the laws, that he did not call you to his coun&s;el; &s;urely he made them before you were born, without de&s;iring your advice, and you came into the world too late for to rever&s;e them; if you could have done &s;o great a work, you &s;hould have &s;lept out of your nothing|ne&s;s and have contradicted Chri&s;t when he was on earth, or <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> before him, or have &s;ave <HI>Adam</HI> and his &s;inful progeny from the threatened death, that &s;o there might have been no need of Chri&s;t! And what if God withdraw his patience and &s;ub|&s;tentation, and let you drop into hell while you are quarrelling with his word, will you then believe that there is an hell.</P>
<P N="4">4. If &s;in be &s;uch an evil that it requireth the <HI>Death of Chri&s;t</HI> for its expiation, no wonder if it de&s;erve our everla&s;ting mi&s;ery.</P>

When you fully know all the&s;e, you &s;hall fully know the de&s;ert of &s;in be&s;ides. You know that the offender is too partial to judge the law, or the pro|ceeding of his judge. We judge by feeling, which binds our rea&s;on. We &s;ee in common worldly things that mo&s;t men think the cau&s;e is right which is their own, and that all is wrong that's done again&s;t them; and let the mo&s;t wi&s;e or ju&s;t impartial friends per|&s;uade them to the contrary, and it is all in vain. There are few children but think the father is un|merciful, or dealeth hardly with them, if he whip them.

<P>I BESEECH you now all that love your &s;ouls, that, in&s;tead of quarrelling with God and with his word, you will pre&s;ently &s;toop to it, and u&s;e it for your good.

When God, that cannot lie, hath told you this; when you hear it from the Maker and Judge of the world, it is time for him that hath ears to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear; by this time you may &s;ee what you have to tru&s;t to. You are but dead and damned men, except you will be converted. Should I tell you otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould deceive you with a lie. Should I hide this from you, I &s;hould undo you, and be guilty of your blood, as the ver&s;es before my text a&s;&s;ure me, ver. 8. <HI>When I &s;ay to the wicked man, O wicked man, thou &s;halt &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly die? if thou do&s;t not &s;peak to warn the wick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d from his way, that wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</HI> You &s;ee then, though this be a rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h and unwelcome doctrine, it is &s;uch as we mu&s;t preach and you mu&s;t hear.

If your nece&s;&s;ities did not require it, we would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l your tender ears with truths that &s;eem &s;o harth and grievous. Hell would not be &s;o full if people were but willing to know their ca&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o hear and think of it. The rea|&s;on why &s;o few e&s;cape it is, becau&s;e they &s;trive not to enter in at the &s;trait gate of conver&s;ion, and go the narrow way of Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">s while they have time: and they &s;trive not, becau&s;e they be not awakened to a lively feeling of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ger they are in; and

If you will not thoroughly believe this truth, methinks the weight of it &s;hould force you to remember it, and it &s;hould follow you, and give you no re&s;t till you are converted. If you had but once heard this word by the voice of an angel, <HI>thou mu&s;t be converted,</HI> or <HI>condemned: turn or die;</HI> would it not &s;tick in your mind, and haunt you night and day? &s;o that in your &s;inning you would re|member it, as if the voice were &s;till in your ears, <HI>turn or die!</HI> O happy were your &s;ouls if it might thus work with you, and never be forgotten, or let you alone till it have driven home your hearts to God,&mdash;But if you will ca&s;t it out by forgetful|ne&s;s or unbelief, how can it work to your conver|&s;ion and &s;alvation? But take this with you to your &s;orrow, tho' you may put this out of your minds. you cannot put it out of the Bible, but there it will &s;tand as a &s;ealed truth, which you &s;hall experimen|tally know forever, that there is no other way, but <HI>turn or die.</HI></P>
<P>O what is the matter then that the hearts of &s;in|ners be not pierced with &s;uch a weighty truth? A man would think now that every unconverted &s;oul that hears the&s;e words &s;hould be pricked to the heart, and think with them&s;elves, <HI>this is my own ca&s;e,</HI> and never be quiet till they found them&s;elves converted. Believe it, fits, this drow&s;y carele&s;s temper will not la&s;t long. Conver&s;ion and Con|demnation are both of them awakening things, and one of them will make you feel ere long, I can foretell it as truly as if I &s;aw it with my eyes, that either grace or hell will &s;hortly bring the&s;e matters to the quick, and make you &s;ay, <HI>What have I done? what a fooli&s;h wicked cour&s;e have I taken?</HI> The
<PB N="17" REF="028243_0009_0FD74647EE1D3CA0">&s;cornful and the &s;tupid &s;tate of &s;inners will la&s;t but a little while; as &s;oon as they either <HI>turn or die,</HI> the pre&s;umptuous dream will be at an end, and then their wits and feeling will return.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;ore&s;ee there are two things that are like to harden the unconverted, and make me lo&s;e all my labour, except they can be taken out of the way; and that is the mi&s;under&s;tanding of tho&s;e two words, (The wicked) and (Turn.) Some will think to them&s;elves, it is true the wicked mu&s;t turn or die; but what is that to me, I am not wicked, though I am a &s;inner, as all men be: Others will think, 'it is true that we mu&s;t turn from our evil ways, but I am turned long ago, I hope this is not now to do.' And thus while wicked men think they are not wicked, but are already converted, we lo&s;e all our labour in per&s;uading them to turn. I &s;hall, there|fore, before I go any farther, tell you here who are meant by the wicked; and who they be that mu&s;t turn or die; and al&s;o what is meant by turning, and who they be that are truly converted: And this I have purpo&s;ely re&s;erved for this place, preferring the method that fits my end.</P>
<P>And here you may ob&s;erve, that in the &s;en&s;e of the text, a wicked man and a converted man are con|traries. No man is a wicked man that is converted; and no man is a converted man that is wicked; &s;o that to be a wicked man and to be an unconverted man, is all one; and, therefore, in opening one, we &s;hall open both.</P>
<P>Before I can tell you what either wickedne&s;s or conver&s;ion is, I mu&s;t go to the bottom and fetch up the matter from the beginning.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed the great Creator of the world to make three &s;ort of living creatures: <HI>Angels</HI> he made pore &s;pirits without fle&s;h, and therefore he made them only for heaven, and not for to dwell on earth.&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="028243_0010_0FD74649599EB740"><HI>Brittes</HI> were made fle&s;h without immortal &s;ouls, and therefore they were made only for earth, and not for heaven.&mdash;<HI>Man</HI> is of a middle nature, between both, as partaking of both fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and there|fore he was made both for heaven and earth. But as his fle&s;h is made to be but a &s;ervant to his &s;pirit, &s;o is he made for earth, but as his pa&s;&s;age or way to heaven, and not that this &s;hould be his home or happine&s;s. The ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate that man was made for, was to behold the glorious maje&s;ty of the Lord, and to prai&s;e him among his holy angels, and to love him, and be filled with his love forever. And as this was the end that man was made for, &s;o God did give him means that were fitted to the attaining of it. The&s;e means were principally two: For the right inclination and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind of man. Secondly, the right ordering of his life and practice. For the fir&s;t, God &s;uited the di&s;po&s;ition of man unto his end, giving him &s;uch knowledge of God as was fit for his pre&s;ent &s;tate, and a heart di&s;po&s;ed and in|clined to God in holy love. But yet he did not &s;in, or confirm him in this condition, but, having made him a free agent, he left him in the hands of his own free will. For the &s;econd, God did that which belonged to him; that is, he gave him a perfect law, required him to continue in the love of God, and perfectly to obey him. By the wilful breach of this law, man did not only forfeit his hopes of everla&s;t|ing life, but al&s;o turned his heart from God, and fixed it on the&s;e lower fle&s;hy things, and hereby did blot out the &s;piritual image of God from his &s;oul; &s;o that man did both fall &s;hort of the glory of God, which was his end, and put him&s;elf our of the way by which he &s;hould have attained it, and this both as to the frame of his heart, and of his life. The holy inclination and love of his &s;oul to God he lo&s;t, and, in&s;tead of it, he contracted an inclination and love to the plea&s;ing of his fle&s;h, or carnal &s;elf, by
<PB N="19" REF="028243_0010_0FD74649599EB740">earthly things; growing &s;trange to God, and ac|quainted with the creature: And the cour&s;e of this life was &s;uited to the bent and inclination of his heart; he lived to his carnal &s;elf, and not to God; he &s;ought the creature for the plea&s;ing of his fle&s;h, in&s;tead of &s;eeking to plea&s;e the Lord. With this nature or corrupt inclination we are all now born into the world; <HI>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> Job xiv. 4. As a lion hath a fierce and cruel nature before he doth devour: and an adder hath a venomous nature before &s;he &s;tings, &s;o in our infancy we have tho&s;e &s;inful natures or in|clinations, before we think or &s;peak, or do ami&s;s; and hence &s;pringeth all the &s;in of our lives; and not only &s;o, but when God hath, of his mercy, pro|vided us a remedy, even the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be the Saviour of our &s;ouls, and bring us back to God again, we naturally love our pre&s;ent &s;tate, and are loth to be brought out of it, and therefore are &s;et again&s;t the means of our recovery, and though cu&s;tom hath taught us to thank Chri&s;t for his good|will, yet carnal &s;elf per&s;uadeth us to refu&s;e his re|medies, and to de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed when we are commanded to take the medicines which he offereth, and are called to for&s;ake all and follow him to God and glory.</P>
<P>I pray you read over this leaf again, and mark it, for in the&s;e few words you have a true de&s;cription of our natural &s;tate, and con&s;equently of a wicked man; for every man that is in this &s;tate of corrupted nature is a wicked man, and in a &s;tate of death.</P>
<P>By this al&s;o you are prepared to under&s;tand what it is to be converted; to which end you mu&s;t fur|ther know, that the mercy of God, not willing that man &s;hould peri&s;h in his &s;in, provided a remedy, by cau&s;ing his &s;on to take our nature, and being, in one per&s;on, God and man, to become a mediator between God and man, and by dying for our &s;ins on
<PB N="20" REF="028243_0011_0FD7464C39F92408">the cro&s;s, to ran&s;om us from the cur&s;e of God, and the power of the devil; and having thus redeemed us, the Father hath delivered us into his hands as his own. Hereupon the Father and the mediator do make a new law and covenant for man, not like the fir&s;t, which gave life to none but the perfectly obedient, and condemned man for every &s;in; but Chri&s;t hath made a law of grace, or a promi&s;e of pardon and everla&s;ting life to all that, by true re|pentance, and by faith in Chri&s;t, are converted un|to God; like an act of oblivion, which is made by a prince to a company of rebels, on condition they will lay down arms and come in, and be loyal &s;ub|jects for the time to come.</P>
<P>But, becau&s;e the Lord knoweth that the heart of man is grown &s;o wicked, that, for all this, men will not accept of the remedy if they be left to them|&s;elves, therefore the Holy Gho&s;t hath undertaken it as his office, to a&s;pire the apo&s;tles, and &s;eal up the &s;criptures by miracles and wonders, and to illumi|nate and convert the &s;ouls of the elect.</P>
<P>So that by this much you &s;ee, that as there are three per&s;ons in the trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;o each of the&s;e per&s;ons have their &s;everal works, which are eminently a&s;cribed to them.</P>
<P>The Father's works were, to create us, to rule us, as his rational creatures, by the law of nature, and judge us thereby, and, in mercy, to provide us a redeemer when we are lo&s;t, and to &s;end his &s;on, and accept his ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The works of the Son, for us, were the&s;e: To ran&s;om and redeem us by his &s;uffering and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, to give out the promi&s;e or law of grace, and rule and judge the world as their redeemer on terms of grace, and to make interce&s;&s;ion for us, that the benefits of his death may be communicated, and to &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t, (which the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doth by the Son.)</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028243_0011_0FD7464C39F92408">
The works of the Holy Gho&s;t, for us, are the&s;e, To indite the holy &s;criptures, by in&s;piring and guiding the apo&s;tles and &s;ealing the word, by his miraculous gifts and works, and the illuminating and exciting the ordinary mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and &s;o enabling them and helping them to publi&s;h that word; and by the &s;ame word illuminating and converting the &s;ouls of men. So that, as you could not have been <HI>rea&s;onable creatures</HI> if the Father had not created you, nor have had any <HI>acce&s;s to God</HI> if the <HI>Son</HI> had not <HI>redeemed</HI> you, &s;o neither can you have a part of Chri&s;t, or be &s;aved, except the Holy Gho&s;t do &s;anctify yon.</P>
<P>So that, by this time, you may &s;ee the &s;everal cau&s;es of this work: The Father &s;endeth the Son, the Son redeemeth us, and maketh the promi&s;e of grace; the Holy Gho&s;t inditeth and &s;ealeth this go&s;pel; the apo&s;tles are the &s;ecretaries of the &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o write it; the preachers of the go&s;pel to proclaim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, and per&s;uade them to open it: and the Holy Gho&s;t doth make their preaching effectual, by open|ing the hearts of men to entertain it.

<P>By this, which I have &s;aid, you may &s;ee what it is to be wicked, and what it is to be converted; which, I think, will be yet plainer unto you, if I de|&s;cribe them as con&s;i&s;ting of their &s;everal parts; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the fir&s;t, a wicked man may be known by the&s;e three things:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He is one that placeth his chief content on earth, and loveth the creature more than God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his fle&s;hy pro&s;perity above the heavenly felicity;
<PB N="22" REF="028243_0012_0FD7465C58C90438">he favoureth the things of the fle&s;h, but neither di&s;|cerneth nor favoureth the things of the &s;pirit; though he will &s;ay, that heaven is better than earth, yet doth he not really &s;o e&s;teem it to him&s;elf. It he might be &s;ure of earth, he would let go heaven, and had rather &s;tay here than be removed thither.&mdash; A life of perfect holine&s;s in the &s;ight of God, and in his love and prai&s;es forever in heaven, doth not find &s;uch liking with his heart as a life of health, and wealth, and honour here upon earth: And though he fal&s;ely profe&s;&s;es that he loveth God above all, yet, indeed, he never felt the power of divine love within him, but his mind is more &s;et on the world, or fle&s;hy plea&s;ures, than on God. In a word whoever loveth earth above heaven, and fle&s;hy pro&s;|perity more than God, is a wicked unconverted man.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, a converted man is illumi|nated to di&s;cern the loveline&s;s of God, and &s;o fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> believeth the glory that is to be had with God, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his heart is taken up to it, and &s;et more upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than on any thing in this world.

<P><PB N="23" REF="028243_0012_0FD7465C58C90438">
Secondly, A wicked man is one that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>principal bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to pro&s;per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the world,</HI> and retain his fle&s;hey ends. And though he may read, and hear, and do much in the outward duties of religion, and forbear di&s;graceful &s;ins, yet this is all but upon the by, and he never makes it the trade and principal bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to plea&s;e God, and attain everla&s;ting glory, and puts off God with the leavings of the world, and gives him no more &s;ervice than the fle&s;h can &s;pare, for he will not part with all for heaven.</P>
<P>On the contrary, a converted man is one that makes it the <HI>principal care and bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to plea&s;e God,</HI> and to be &s;aved, and takes all the ble&s;&s;ings of this life but as accommodations in his journey towards another life, and u&s;eth the creature in &s;ubordination unto God; he loveth an holy life, and longeth to be more holy; he hath no &s;in but what he hateth, and longeth and prayeth, and &s;triveth to be rid of it.

There is nothing in this world &s;o dear to him but he can give it up to God, and for&s;ake it for him and the hopes of glory. All this you may &s;ee in Col. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Matt. vi. 20, 33.

<P>Thirdly, The &s;oul of a wicked man did never truly di&s;cern and reli&s;h the my&s;tery of redemption, nor thankfully entertain an offered Saviour, nor is he taken up with the love of the Redeemer, nor willing to be ruled by him as phy&s;ician of his &s;oul, that he may be &s;aved from the guilt and power of his &s;ins, and recovered unto God; but his heart is in&s;en&s;ible of this un&s;peakable benefit, and is quite again&s;t the healing means by which he &s;hould be re|covered.
<PB N="24" REF="028243_0013_0FD74660A7BA0370">Though he may be willing to be carnally religious, yet he never re&s;igneth up his &s;oul to Chri&s;t, and to the motions and conduct of his word and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the converted &s;oul having felt him&s;elf undone by &s;in and perceiving that he hath lo&s;t his peace with God, and hopes of heaven, and is in danger of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, doth thankfully entertain the tidings of redemption, and believing in the Lord Je&s;us as his only Saviour, re&s;igning up him&s;elf to him for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifi|cation and redemption.

<P>YOU &s;ee now in plain terms, from the word of God, who are the wicked, and who are the converted. Ignorant people think, that if a man be no &s;wearer, nor cur&s;er, nor railer, nor drunkard, nor fornicator, nor extortioner, nor wrong any body in their dealings, and if they come to church, and &s;ay their prayers, the&s;e cannot be wicked men. Or, if a man that hath been guilty of drunkenne&s;s, &s;wearing, or gaming, or the like vices, do but for|bear them for the time to come, they think that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is a converted man. Others think, if a man that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> been an enemy and &s;corner at godline&s;s, do but ap|prove it, and be hated for it by the wicked, as the godly are, that this mu&s;t needs be a converted man. And &s;ome are &s;o fooli&s;h as to think that they are con|verted,
<PB N="25" REF="028243_0013_0FD74660A7BA0370">by taking up &s;ome new and fal&s;e opinion; and falling into &s;ome dividing party, as anabapti&s;ts, quakers, papi&s;ts, and &s;uch like. And &s;ome think, if they have but been affrighted by the fears of hell, and had convictions, and gripes of con&s;cience, and thereupon have purpo&s;ed and promi&s;ed amendment, and take up a life of civil behaviour, and outward religion, that this mu&s;t needs be true conver&s;ion. And the&s;e are the poor deluded &s;ouls that are like to lo&s;e the benefit of all our per&s;ua&s;ions: and when they hear that the wicked mu&s;t turn or die, they think that this is not &s;poken to them; for they are not wicked, but are turned already. And, therefore, it is that Chri&s;t told &s;ome of the rulers of the Jews, who were greater and civiler than the common peo|ple, that <HI>publicans and haerlots do go into the king|dom of Chri&s;t before them,</HI> Matt. xxi. 31. Not that an harlot, or gro&s;s &s;inner, can be &s;aved without con|ver&s;ion; but becau&s;e it was ea&s;ier to make the&s;e gro&s;s &s;inners perceive their &s;in and mi&s;ery, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a change, when the civiler &s;ort do de|lude them&s;elves by thinking that they are converted already, when they be not.</P>
<P>O, &s;irs, conver&s;ion is another kind of work than mo&s;t are aware of: It's not a &s;mall matter to bring an earthly mind to heaven, and to &s;hew man the amiable excellencies of God, till he be taken up in &s;uch love to him that can never be quenched; to break the heart for &s;in and make him fly for refuge unto Chri&s;t, and thankfully embrace him as the life of his &s;oul; to have the very drift and bent of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and life to be changed; &s;o that a man re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ced that which he took for his felicity and placeth his felicity where he never did before; and liveth not to the &s;ame end, and driveth not on the &s;ame de&s;ign in the world, as formerly he did: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a word, he that is in Chri&s;t is a <HI>new creature; old things are pa&s;t away, behold all things are be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s

He hath a new under&s;tanding, a new will and re&s;olution, new &s;orrows, and de&s;ires and love, and delight; new thoughts, new &s;peeches, new company (if po&s;&s;ible) and a new conver&s;ation. Sin, that before was a je&s;ting matter with him, is now &s;o odious and terrible to him, that he flies from it as from death. The world, that was &s;o lovely in his eyes, doth now appear but as vanity and vex|ation; God, that was before neglected, is now the only happine&s;s of his &s;oul; before he was forgotten, and every la&s;t preferred before him; but now he is &s;et next the heart, and all things mu&s;t give place to him; and the heart is taken up in the attendance and ob&s;ervance of him; and is grieved when he hides his face; and never thinks it&s;elf well without him. Chri&s;t him&s;elf that was wont to be &s;lightly thought of, is now his only hope and refuge, and he lives upon him as on his daily bread; he cannot pray without him, nor rejoice without him, nor think, nor &s;peak, nor live without him. Heaven it&s;elf, that before was looked upon but as a tolerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;erve, which he hoped might &s;erve in turn better than hell, when he could not &s;tay any longer in the world, is now taken for his home, the place of his only hope and re&s;t, where he &s;hall &s;ee, and love and prai&s;e that God that hath his heart already. <HI>Hell.</HI> that did &s;eem before but a bugbear to frighten men from &s;in, doth now appear to be a real mi&s;ery, that is not to be ventured on, nor je&s;ted with. The works of holine&s;s, which before he was weary of, and &s;eemed to be more ado than needs, are now both his recreation, and his bu&s;ine&s;s, and the trade that he lives upon. The Bible, which was before to him but almo&s;t as a common book, is now as the law of God; as a letter written to him from heaven, and &s;ub&s;cribed with the name of the <HI>Eternal Maje&s;ty,</HI> it is the rule of his thoughts, and words, and deeds; the commands are binding, the threats are dreadful,
<PB N="27" REF="028243_0014_0FD74661DE9E5160">and the promi&s;es of it &s;peak life to his &s;oul. The godly, that &s;eemed to him but like other men, are now the excellente&s;t and happie&s;t on earth. And the wicked, that were his play-fellows, are now his grief; and he that could laugh at their &s;in, is readier now to weep for their &s;in and mi&s;ery, P&s;al. xvi. 3. and xv. 4. Phil, iii. 18. In &s;hort, he hath a new end in his thoughts, and a new way in his endeavours, and, therefore, his heart and life is new. Before, his carnal &s;elf was his end; and his plea&s;ure and worldly profits and credit were his way: And now God and everla&s;ting glory is his end; and Chri&s;t and the &s;pirit, and word, and ordinances. Holine&s;s to God, and righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy to men; the&s;e are his way. Before, &s;elf was the chiefe&s;t ruler, to which the matters of God and con&s;cience mu&s;t &s;toop and give place; and now God, in Chri&s;t, by the &s;pi|rit, word and mini&s;try, is the chief ruler, to whom both &s;elf, and all the matters of &s;elf, mu&s;t give place. So that, this is not a change in one or two, or twenty points, but in the whole &s;oul, and the very end and bent of the conver&s;ation. A man may &s;tep out of one path into another, and yet have his face the &s;ame way, and be &s;till going towards the &s;ame place, but it is another matter to turn quite back again, and take his journey the clean contrary way, to a con|trary place. So it is here, a man may turn from drunkenne&s;s to thriftine&s;s, and for&s;ake his good fel|low&s;hip, and other gro&s;s di&s;graceful &s;ins, and &s;et up|on &s;ome duties of religion, and yet be &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> going to the &s;ame end as before, in tending his carnal &s;elf above all, and giving it &s;till the government of his &s;oul, but when he is converted, this &s;elf is denied, and taken down, and God is &s;et up, and his face is turned the contrary way; and he that before was ad|dicted to him&s;elf, and lived to him&s;elf, is now, by &s;anctification, devoted to God, and liveth unto God; before, he a&s;keth him&s;elf, what he &s;hould do

<P>Beloved friends, if the Lord had not awakened me to believe, and lay to heart the&s;e things my&s;elf, I &s;hould have remained in the dark and &s;elfi&s;h &s;tate, and have peri&s;hed for ever; but if he have truly made me &s;en&s;ible of them, it will con&s;train me to compa&s;&s;ionate you as well as my&s;elf. If your eyes were &s;o far opened as to &s;ee hell, and you &s;aw your neighbours, that were unconverted, dragged thither with hideous cries; though they were &s;uch as you accounted hone&s;t people on earth, and feared no &s;uch matter by them&s;elves, &s;uch a &s;ight would make you go home and think of it, and think again, and make you warn all about you, as that damned worldling in Luke xvi. 28. would have had his brethren warned, le&s;t they come to that place of tor|ment. Why, faith is a kind of &s;ight; it is the eye of the &s;oul, the evidence of things not &s;een: If I believe God, it is next to &s;eeing: And, therefore, I be&s;eech you to excu&s;e me, if I be half as earne&s;t with you about the&s;e matters, as if I had &s;een them. If I mu&s;t die to-morrow, and it were in my power to come again from another world, and tell you what I had &s;een, would you not be willing to hear me? And would you not believe and regard what I &s;hould tell you? If I might preach one <HI>&s;ermon</HI> to you after I am dead, and have &s;een what is done in the world to come, would you not have me plainly &s;peak the truth, and would you not croud to hear me, and would you not lay it to heart? But this mu&s;t not be; God hath his appointed way of teach|ing you by &s;cripture and <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and he will not humour unbelievers &s;o far as to &s;end men from the dead to them, and to alter his e&s;tabli&s;hed way; if any man quarrel with the &s;un, God will not hu|mour him &s;o far as to &s;et him up a cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carer light.&mdash;

Well, God forbid that I &s;hould neglect this work any longer. What &s;tate is my &s;oul in? Am I converted, or am I not? Was ever &s;uch a change or work done upon my &s;oul? Have I been illuminated by the word and &s;pirit of the Lord, to &s;ee the odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, the need of a Saviour, the love of Chri&s;t, and the excellencies of God and glory? Is my heart broken, or humbled within me, for my former life? Have I thankfully entertained my Saviour and Lord, that offered him&s;elf with pardon and life for my &s;oul? Do I hate my former &s;inful life, and the remnant of every &s;in that is in me? Do I fly from them as my deadly enemies?

<P>Sirs, this is my reque&s;t to you, that you will but take your hearts to ta&s;k, and thus examine them, till you &s;ee, if it may be, whether you are converted or not? And if you cannot find it out by your own endeavours, go to your <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> if they be faithful and experienced men, and de&s;ire their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;The matter is great, let not ba&s;hfulne&s;s, nor care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s hinder you. They are &s;et over you, to ad|vi&s;e you, for the &s;aving of your &s;oul, as phy&s;icians advi&s;e you for the curing of your bodies. It undoes many thou&s;ands that they think they are in the way to &s;alvation, when they are not; and think that they are converted, when it is no &s;uch thing. And then, when we call to them daily to turn, they go away as they came; and think that this concerns not them; for they are turned already, and hope they &s;hall do well enough in the way that they are in, at lea&s;t if they do pick the faire&s;t path, and avoid &s;ome of the foule&s;t &s;teps; when, alas, all this while they live but to the world, and fle&s;h, and are &s;trangers to God and eternal life; and are quite out of the way to heaven. And all this is much, becau&s;e we cannot per&s;uade them to a few &s;erious thoughts of their condition, and &s;pend a few hours in the examining of their &s;tates: Is there not many a &s;elf deceiving wretch that hears me this day, that never be&s;towed one hour, or quarter of an hour, in all their lives, to examine their &s;ouls, and try whether they are truly converted or not? O merciful God, that will care for &s;uch wretches that care no more for them&s;elves, and that will do &s;o much to &s;ave them from hell, and help them to heaven, who will do &s;o little for it them&s;elves! If all that are in the way to hell, and in the &s;tate of damnation, did but know it, they dur&s;t not continue in it. The greate&s;t hope that the

I do here in the name of the Lord of life, proclaim to you all that hear me this day, to the wor&s;t of you, to the greate&s;t, to the olde&s;t &s;in|ner, that you may have mercy and &s;alvation, if you will but turn. There is mercy in God, there is &s;uffi|ciency in the &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t, the promi&s;e is free, and full, and univer&s;al; you may have life, if you will but turn. But then as you love your &s;ouls, remember what turning it is that Scripture &s;peaks of. It is not to mend the old hou&s;e, but to pull down all, and build anew, on Chri&s;t the Rock and &s;ure Foundation. It is not to mend &s;omewhat in a carnal cour&s;e of life, but to mortify the fle&s;h, and live after the Spirit. It is not to &s;erve the fle&s;h and the world, in a more reformed way, without any &s;candalous di&s;graceful &s;ins, and with a certain kind of religiou&s;ne&s;s; but it is to change your ma&s;ter, and your works, and end; and to &s;et your face the con|trary way, and do all for the life that you never &s;aw; and dedicate your&s;elves, and all you have, to God. This is the change that mu&s;t be made if you will live.</P>
<P>Your&s;elves are witne&s;&s;es now, that it is &s;alvation, and not damnation, that is the great doctrine I preach to you; and the fir&s;t part of my me&s;&s;age to you. Accept of this, and we &s;hall go no further with you; for we would not &s;o much as affright, or trouble you with the name of damnation, with|out nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But if you will not be &s;aved, there is no remedy but damnation mu&s;t take place. For there is no middle palce between the two: You mu&s;t have either life or death.</P>
<P>And we are not only to offer you life, but to &s;hew you the grounds on which we do it, and call you to believe that God doth mean, indeed, as he &s;peaks; that the promi&s;e is true, and extended con|ditionally
<PB N="38" REF="028243_0020_0FD74676DE7EF9F0">to you, as well as others; and that hea|ven is no fancy, but a true felicity.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k, where is your commi&s;&s;ion for this offer, Among an hundred texts of &s;cripture, I will &s;hew it unto you in the&s;e few.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, You &s;ee it here in my text, and the follow|ing ver&s;es; and in the 18th of Ezek. as plain as can be &s;poken: and in 1 Cor. v. 17. xviii. 16. xx. 21. you have the very &s;um of our commi&s;&s;ion, "If any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature: old things are pa&s;t away, behold all things are be|come new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the mini&s;try of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf; not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es to them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation: Now then we are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead be ye reconciled unto God; for he hath made him to be &s;in for us, who know no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him." So Mark xvi. 15, 16. "Go ye into the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature; he that believeth, (that is, with &s;uch a converting faith as is expre&s;&s;ed) and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved; and he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned." And Luke xxiv. 3640. Thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead the third day, and that repen|tance (which is conver&s;ion) and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations." And Acts v. 30, 31. "The God of our fathers rai&s;ed up Je&s;us, whom ye &s;lew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to I&s;rael, and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins." And Acts xiii. 38, 39. "Be it known unto you, therefore men and bre|thren, That through this man is preached unto you
<PB N="39" REF="028243_0020_0FD74676DE7EF9F0">the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; and by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which you could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es." And le&s;t you think this offer is re&s;trained to the Jews, &s;ee Gal. vi. 13. "For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a new creature." And Luke xiv. 17. "Come, for all things are now ready." And ver&s;e 22, 24.</P>
<P>You &s;ee by this time that we are commanded to offer life to you all, and to tell you from God, that if you will turn, you may live.</P>
<P>Here you may &s;afely tru&s;t your &s;ouls; for the love of God is the fountain of this offer. Job iii. 16. and the blood of the Son of God hath pur|cha&s;ed it; the faithfulne&s;s and truth of God is en|gaged to make the promi&s;e good; miracles oft &s;eal|ed up the truth of it; preachers are &s;ent through the world to proclaim it; the &s;acraments are in&s;tituted and u&s;ed for the &s;olemn delivery of the mercy of|fered to them that will accept it; and the &s;pirit doth open the heart to entertain it, and is it&s;elf the ear|ne&s;t of the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. So that the truth of it is pa&s;t controver&s;y, that the wor&s;t of you all, and eve|ry one of you, if you will but be converted, may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Indeed, if thou will needs believe that you &s;hall be &s;aved without conver&s;ion, then you believe a fal&s;ehood; and if I &s;hould preach that to you, I &s;hould preach a lie: This were not to believe God, but the devil and your own deceitful hearts. God hath his promi&s;e of life, and the devil hath his pro|mi&s;e of life. God's promi&s;e is. <HI>Return and live.</HI> The devil's promi&s;e is, <HI>You &s;hall live, whether you turn or not.</HI> The words of God are as I have &s;hew|ed you. <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as lit|tle children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Matth. xviii. 3. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> John iii. 3, 5. <HI>Without holine&s;s none &s;hall &s;ee
<PB N="40" REF="028243_0021_0FD7467B3ABD1048">God,</HI> Heb. xii. 14. The devil's word, <HI>You may be &s;aved without being born again and converted; you may do well enough without being holy; God doth but frighten you; he is more merciful than to do as he &s;aith; he will be better to you than his word.</HI> And alas, the greate&s;t part of the world believe this word of the devil, before the word of God; ju&s;t as our fir&s;t &s;in and mi&s;ery came into the world. God &s;aith to our fir&s;t parents, <HI>If ye eat ye &s;hall die:</HI> And the devil contradicted him, and &s;aith, <HI>Ye &s;hall not die;</HI> and the woman believed the devil before God. So now the Lord &s;aith, <HI>Turn or die:</HI> And the de|vil &s;aith, <HI>You &s;hall not die, if you do but cry God's mercy at la&s;t, and give over the acts of &s;in when you can practice it no longer.</HI> And this is the word that the world believes. O heinous wickedne&s;s, to believe the devil before God!</P>
<P>And yet that is not the wor&s;t, but bla&s;phemi|ou&s;ly they call this <HI>a believing and tru&s;ting in God,</HI> when they put him in the &s;hape of <HI>Satan,</HI> who was a liar from the beginning; and when they believe that the word of God is a lie, they call this a <HI>tru&s;t|ing God,</HI> and &s;ay they believe in him, and tru&s;t on him for &s;alvation: Where did ever God &s;ay, That the unregenerate, unconverted, un&s;anctified, &s;hall be &s;aved? Shew &s;uch a word in &s;cripture. I chal|lenge you if you can. Why this is the devil's word, and to believe it is to believe the devil, and the &s;in that is commonly called pre&s;umption; and do you you call this a <HI>believing and tru&s;ting in God?</HI> There is enough in the word of God to comfort and &s;trengthen the hearts of the &s;anctified; but not a word to &s;trengthen the hands of wickedne&s;s, nor to give men the lea&s;t hope of being &s;aved, though they be never &s;anctified.</P>
<P>But if you will turn, and come into the way of mercy, the mercy of the Lord is ready to entertain you. Then tru&s;t God for &s;alvation, boldly and con|fidently; for he is engaged by his word to &s;ave you.
<PB N="41" REF="028243_0021_0FD7467B3ABD1048">He will be a father to none but his children, and he will &s;ave none but tho&s;e that for&s;ake the world, the devil, and the fle&s;h, and come into his family to be members of his Son, and have communion with his &s;aints. But if they will not come in, it is long of them&s;elves: His doors are open; he keeps none back; he never &s;ent &s;uch a me&s;&s;enger as this to any of you; <HI>It is now too late: I will not receive thee though thou be converted.</HI> He might have done &s;o, and done you no wrong; but he did not: he doth not to this day: He is &s;till ready to receive you, if you were but ready unfeignedly, and with all your heart to turn. And the fulne&s;s of this truth will yet more appear in the two following doctrines, which I &s;hall therefore next proceed to, before I make any further application of this.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>Doct. 3.</HI> God taketh plea&s;ure in men's conver&s;ion and Salvation, but not in their death or damnation; he had rather they would return and live, than go on and die.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall fir&s;t teach you how to under&s;tand this, and then clear up the truth of it to you: And for the fir&s;t, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve the&s;e follow|ing things; 1. A <HI>&s;imple willingne&s;s or complacency</HI> is the fir&s;t act of the will following the &s;imple <HI>ap|prehen&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> before it proceed|eth to compare things together; but the <HI>choo&s;ing</HI> act of the will is a following act, and &s;uppo&s;eth the <HI>comparing practical</HI> act of the <HI>under&s;tanding;</HI> and the&s;e two acts may be often carried to <HI>contrary</HI> ob|jects, without any fault at all in the per&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">2. An unfeigned willingne&s;s may have divers de|grees; &s;ome things I am &s;o far willing of as that I will do all that lieth in my power to accompli&s;h it, and &s;ome things I am truly willing another &s;hould do, when yet I will not do all that ever I

<P N="3">3. The will of <HI>a Ruler, as &s;uch,</HI> is manife&s;ted in <HI>making and executing laws?</HI> but the will of a <HI>man</HI> in his <HI>&s;imple natural capacity,</HI> or as <HI>ab&s;olute lord</HI> of his <HI>own</HI> is manife&s;ted in de&s;iring or re&s;olv|ing of <HI>events.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. A ruler's will, as <HI>law giver,</HI> is fir&s;t, and principally, that his <HI>laws be obeyed,</HI> and not at all that the penalty be executed on any, but only on &s;uppo&s;ition that they <HI>will not obey his people;</HI> but a <HI>ruler's</HI> will, as judge, &s;uppo&s;eth the law already either kept o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> broken, and therefore he re&s;olveth on reward or puni&s;hment accordingly.</P>
<P>Having given you tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions, I &s;hall next apply them to the ca&s;e in hand, in the&s;e following propo&s;itions:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is the <HI>glo&s;s of the word and creatures,</HI> that in this life we mu&s;t know God, and &s;o according to the nature of man we a&s;cribe to him <HI>under&s;tand|ing and will,</HI> removing all the imperfections that we can, becau&s;e we are capable of no higher po&s;i|tive conceptions of him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. And on the &s;ame grounds we do, with the &s;cripture, di&s;tingui&s;h between the acts of God's will, as diver&s;i&s;fied from the re&s;pects or the objects, though as to God's e&s;&s;ence they are all one.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And the boldlier, becau&s;e that when we &s;peak of Chri&s;t, we have the more ground for it from his human nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. And thus we &s;ay, that the <HI>&s;imple complacency, will</HI> or <HI>love of God is</HI> to all that is <HI>naturally</HI> or <HI>morally good,</HI> according to the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of its goodne&s;s, and &s;o he hath plea&s;ure in the con|ver&s;ion and &s;alvation of all, which yet will never come to pa&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. And God, as ruler and law-giver of the
<PB N="43" REF="028243_0022_0FD7467C31B89788">world, had &s;o far a practical will for their &s;alva|tion, as to make them a free deed of gift of Chri&s;t and life, and an act of oblivion for all their &s;ins, &s;o be it they will not unthankfully reject it, and to command his me&s;&s;engers to offer this gift to all the world, and per&s;uade them to accept. And &s;o he doth all that, as <HI>law-giver or promi&s;er,</HI> belongs to him to do for their &s;alvation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. But yet he re&s;olveth, as law-giver, that they that will not turn &s;hall die; and as judge, when their day of grace is pa&s;t, he will execute that de|cree.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. So that he thus unfeignedly willeth the con|ver&s;ion of tho&s;e that never will be converted, but not as ab&s;olute Lord with the fulle&s;t efficacious re|&s;olution, nor as a thing which he re&s;olveth &s;hall un|doubtedly come to pa&s;s, or would engage all in his power to accompli&s;h. It is in the power of a prince to &s;et a guard upon a murderer, to &s;ee that he &s;hall not murder and be hanged; but if, upon good rea|&s;on, he forbear this, and do but &s;end to his &s;ub|jects, and warn and intreat them not to be murder|ers, I hope he may well &s;ay that he would not have them murder and be hanged; he takes no plea&s;ure in it, but rather that they forbear and live; and if he do no more for &s;ome, upon &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on, he is not bound to do &s;o by all. The king may well &s;ay to all murderers and felons in the land, "I have no plea&s;ure in your death, but rather that you would obey my laws and live, but if you will not, I am re&s;olved, for all this, that thou &s;halt die." The judge may truly &s;ay to the thief, or a murder|er, "Alas, man, I have no delight in thy death; I had rather thou had&s;t kept the law and &s;aved thy life; but &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not, I mu&s;t condemn thee, or el&s;e I &s;hould be unju&s;t." So, though God have no plea&s;ure in your damnation, and therefore call? upon you to return and live, yet he hath plea&s;ure
<PB N="44" REF="028243_0023_0FD7467DC71E0968">of the demon&s;tration of his own ju&s;tice, and the executing his laws, and therefore he is, for all this, fully re&s;olved, that if you will not be converted, you &s;hall be condemned. If God were &s;o much again&s;t the death of the wicked, as that he were re|&s;olved to do all that he can to hinder it, then no man &s;hould be condemned, whereas Chri&s;t telleth you, that few will be &s;aved. But &s;o far God is again&s;t your damnation, as that he will teach you, and warn you, and &s;et before you life and death, and offer you your choice, and command his mini&s;ters to entreat you not to damn your&s;elves, but accept his mercy, and &s;o to leave you without excu&s;e; but if this will not do, and if &s;till you be uncon|verted, he profe&s;&s;eth to you, he is re&s;olved of your damnation, and hath commanded us to &s;ay unto you in his name, ver&s;e 8. <HI>O wicked man, thou &s;halt &s;urely die!</HI> And Chri&s;t hath little le&s;s than &s;worn it, over and over, with a <HI>verily, verily, except ye be converted, and born again, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Matth. xviii. 3. John iii. 3. Mark that he &s;aith [<HI>you cannot.</HI>] It is in vain to hope for it, and in vain to dream that God is willing of it; for it is a thing that cannot be.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In a word, you &s;ee then the meaning of the text, that God, the great <HI>Lawgiver</HI> of the world, doth take no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn and live; though yet he be re&s;olved that none &s;hall live but tho&s;e that turn; and as a <HI>Judge</HI> even delighteth in ju&s;tice, and ma|nife&s;ting his hatred of &s;in, though not in their mi|&s;ery which they had brought upon them&s;elves, in it&s;elf con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="2">2. And for the proofs of the point, I &s;hall be very brief in them, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e you ea&s;ily be|lieve it already.</P>
<P N="1">1. The very <HI>gracious nature of God</HI> proclaimed; Exod. xxiv. 6. and xxvi. 6. and frequently el&s;e|where,
<PB N="45" REF="028243_0023_0FD7467DC71E0968">may a&s;&s;ure you of this; that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> plea&s;ure in your death.</P>
<P N="2">2. If God had more plea&s;ure in thy death, than in thy conver&s;ion and life, he would not have &s;o frequently commanded thee in his word, to turn; he would not have made thee &s;uch promi&s;es of life if thou wilt but turn; he would not have per&s;uaded thee to it by &s;o many rea&s;ons. The tenor of this go&s;|pel proveth the point.</P>
<P N="3">3. And his commi&s;&s;ion that he hath given to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, doth fully prove it. If God had taken more plea&s;ure in thy damnation, than in thy conver&s;ion and &s;alvation, he would never have charged us to offer you mercy, and to teach you the way of life, both publicly, and privately; and to entreat and be&s;eech you to turn and live; to ac|quaint you with your &s;ins, and tell you of your danger; and to do all that po&s;&s;ibly we can for your conver&s;ion, and to continue patiently &s;o doing, tho' you &s;hould hate or abu&s;e us for our pains. Would God have done this, and appointed his ordinances for your good, if he had taken plea&s;ure in your death?</P>
<P N="4">4. It is proved al&s;o by the cour&s;e of his provi|dence. If God had rather you were damned than converted and &s;aved, he would not &s;econd his word with his works, and entice you by his daily kindne&s;s to him&s;elf, and give you all the mercies of this life, which are his means <HI>to lead you to re|pentance,</HI> Rom. ii. 4. and bring you &s;o often un|der his rod to force you into your wits, he would not &s;et &s;o many examples before your eyes, no, nor wait on you &s;o patiently as he doth from day to day, and year to year. The&s;e be not &s;igns of one that taketh plea&s;ure in your death. If this had been his delight, how ea&s;ily could he have had thee long ago in hell? How oft, before this, could he have catcht thee away in the mid&s;t of thy &s;ins, with a
<PB N="46" REF="028243_0024_0FD746802E9EC0E0">cur&s;e, or oath, or lie in thy mouth, in thy igno|rance, and pride, and &s;en&s;uality? When thou wert la&s;t in thy drunkenne&s;s, or la&s;t deriding the ways of God, how ea&s;ily could he have &s;topt thy breath, and tamed thee with his plagues, and made thee &s;o|ber in another world! Alas, how &s;mall a matter is it for the Almighty to rule the tongue of the pro|phane&s;t rather, and tie the hands of the mo&s;t malici|ous per&s;ecutor, or call the fury of the bittere&s;t of his enemies, and make them know that they are but worms? If he would but frown upon thee thou would&s;t drop into thy grave. If he gave commi&s;|&s;ion to one of his guardian angels to go and de&s;troy ten thou&s;and &s;inners, how quickly would it be done! How ea&s;ily can he lay thee upon the bed of lan|gui&s;hing, and make thee lie roaring there in pain, and make thee eat the words of reproach which thou ha&s;t &s;poken again&s;t his &s;ervants, his word, his work&s;hip, and his holy ways, and make thee &s;end to beg their prayers, whom thou did&s;t de&s;pi&s;e in thy pre&s;umption? How ea&s;ily can he lay that fle&s;h un|der gripes and groans, and make it too weak to hold thy &s;oul, and make it more loath&s;ome than the dung of the earth? That fle&s;h which now mu&s;t have what it loves, and mu&s;t not be di&s;plea&s;ed, though God be di&s;plea&s;ed, and mu&s;t be humoured in meat and drink and clothes, whatever God &s;ay to the contrary, how quickly would the frowns of God con&s;ume it? When thou wa&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately defending thy &s;in, and quarrelling with them that would have drawn thee from it, and &s;hewing thy &s;pleen again&s;t the reprover, and pleading for the works of darkne&s;s; how ea&s;ily could God have &s;natched thee away in a moment, and &s;et thee be|fore his dreadful maje&s;ty, where thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ee ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and glorious angels waiting on his throne, and have called thee there to plead thy cau&s;e, and a&s;ked thee, 'What haft thou

O how thy &s;tubborn heart would have melted, and thy proud looks be taken down, and thy countenance be ap|palied, and thy &s;tout words be turned into &s;peech|le&s;s &s;ilence, or dreadful cries, if God had but &s;et thee at his bar, and pleaded his own cau&s;e with thee, which thou ha&s;t here &s;o maliciou&s;ly pleaded again&s;t! How ea&s;ily can he at any time &s;ay to the guilty &s;oul, 'come away, and live in that fle&s;h no more till the re&s;urrection,' and it cannot re&s;i&s;t. A word of his mouth would take off the poi&s;e of thy pre&s;en, life, and then all thy parts and powers would &s;tand &s;till, and if he &s;ay unto thee, <HI>live no longer, or live in kell,</HI> thou could&s;t not di&s;obey.</P>
<P>But God hath yet done none of this, but hath patiently forborn thee, and mercifully upheld <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and give thee that breath which thou did&s;t breathe out again&s;t him, and give tho&s;e mercies which thou did&s;t &s;acrifice to thy fle&s;h; and afforded thee that provi&s;ion which thou &s;pente&s;t to &s;atisfy thy greedy throat: he gave thee every minute of that time which thou did&s;t wa&s;te in idlene&s;s or drunkenne&s;s, or worldline&s;s; and doth not all his patience and mercy &s;hew that he de&s;ired not thy damnation? Can the candle burn without the oil? Can your hou&s;es &s;tand without the earth to bear them? As well as you can live and hour without the &s;upport of God. And why did he &s;o long &s;upport thy life, but to &s;ee when thou would&s;t bethink thee of the folly of thy ways, and return and live? Will any man purpo&s;ely put arms into his enemies hands to re&s;i&s;t him, or hold a candle to a murderer that is killing his children, or to an idle &s;ervant that plays or

<P N="5">5. It is further proved by the &s;ufferings of his Son, that God taketh no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; Would he have ran&s;omed them from death at &s;o dear a rate? Would he have a&s;toni&s;hed angels and men by his conde&s;cen&s;ion? Would God have dwelt in fle&s;h, and have come in the form of a &s;ervant, and have a&s;&s;umed humility into one per&s;on with the Godhead? And would Chri&s;t have lived a life of &s;uffering, and died a cur&s;ed death for &s;inners, if he had rather taken plea&s;ure in their death? Suppo&s;e you &s;aw him but &s;o bu&s;y in preaching or healing of them, as you find him in Mark iii. 21. or &s;o long in falling, as in Matth. iv. or all night in prayer, as in Luke vi. 12. or praying, with the drops of blood trickling from him in&s;tead of &s;weat, as Luke xxii. 44. on &s;uffering a cur&s;ed death upon the cro&s;s, and pouring out his &s;oul as a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins. Would you have thought the&s;e the &s;igns of one that delighteth in the death of the wicked!</P>

If you had &s;een and heard him weeping, and bemoaning the &s;tate of di&s;obedience in impenitent people, Luke xix. 41, 42. or complaining of their &s;tubbornne&s;s, as Matth. xxiii, 37. "O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, how oft would I have gathered thy children toge|ther, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?" Or if you had &s;een
<PB N="49" REF="028243_0025_0FD74682DF382830">and heard him on the cro&s;s, praying for his per&s;e|cutors, <HI>(Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,)</HI> would you have &s;u&s;pected that he had delighted in the death of the wicked; even of tho&s;e that peri&s;h by their wilful unbelief?

<P N="6">6. La&s;tly. If all this will not yet &s;atisfy you, take his own word, that knoweth be&s;t his own mind, or at lea&s;t, believe his oath; but this leadeth me up to the fourth doctrine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>Doct. 4.</HI> The Lord hath confirmed to us by his oath, that he hath no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he turn and live; that he may leave man no pretence to que&s;tion the truth of it.</HEAD>
<P>IF you dare que&s;tion his word, I hope you dare not que&s;tion his oath. As Chri&s;t hath &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that the unregenerate and unconverted, cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matth. xviii. 3. John iii. 3. So God hath &s;worn that his plea&s;ure is not in their death, but in their conver|&s;ion and life. And, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, Heb. vi. 13, 16, 17, 18. "Becau&s;e, he can &s;wear by no greater than him&s;elf," he &s;aith, "As I live, &amp;c." for men verily &s;wear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation, is to them an end of &s;trife: wherein, God, willing more abundantly to &s;hew unto the heirs of promi&s;e, the immutability of his coun&s;el, confirmed it by an oath, that by two im|mutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for God

If there be any man that cannot re|concile this truth with the doctrine of prede&s;tina|tion, or the actual damnation of the wicked, that is his own ignorance; he hath no pretence left to que&s;tion or deny therefore the truth of the point in hand; for this is confirmed by the oath of God, therefore mu&s;t not be di&s;torted, to reduce to other points; but doubtful points mu&s;t rather be reduced to it, and certain truths mu&s;t be believed to agree with it, though our &s;hallow brains do hardly di&s;cern the agreement.</P>

<P>I Do now intreat thee, if thou be an unconverted &s;inner that beare&s;t the&s;e words, that thou would&s;t ponder a little upon the forementioned doctrines, and bethink thy&s;elf a while, who it is that takes plea&s;ure in thy &s;in and damnation? Certainly, it is not God; he hath &s;worn for his part, that he takes no plea&s;ure in it. And I know it is not the plea&s;ing of him that you intend. You dare not &s;ay, that you drink, and &s;wear, and neglect holy duties, and quench the motions of the &s;pirit to plea&s;e God.&mdash; That were as if you &s;hould reproach the prince, and break his laws, and &s;eek his death, and &s;ay, you did all this to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Who is it then that takes plea&s;ure in your &s;in and death? Not any that bear the image of God, for they mu&s;t be like minded to him.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> Your fle&s;h is plea&s;ed with your &s;in; but is your con&s;cience plea&s;ed? Doth not it grudge within you, and tell you &s;ometimes that all is not well, and that your ca&s;e is not &s;o &s;afe as you make it to be; and &s;hould not your &s;ouls and con&s;ciences be plea&s;ed before that corruptible fle&s;h?</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> But is not your fle&s;h preparing for its own di&s;plea&s;ure al&s;o? It loves the bait, but doth it love the hook? It loves the &s;trong drink and &s;weet mor&s;els; it loves its ea&s;e, and &s;ports, and mer|riment; it loves to be rich and well &s;poken of by men, and to be &s;omebody in the world; but doth it love the cur&s;e of God? doth it love to &s;tand trembling before his bar, and to be judged to ever|la&s;ting fire? Doth it love to be tormented with the devils forever? Take all together, for there is no &s;eperating &s;in and hell, but only by faith and true conver&s;ion; if you will keep one, you mu&s;t have the other. If death and hell be plea&s;ant to thee, no wonder then if you go on in &s;in: But if they be not (as I am &s;ure they be not) then what if &s;in be never &s;o plea&s;ant, is is worth the lo&s;s of life eternal? Is a little drink, or meat, or ea&s;e; is the good word of &s;inners; is the riches of this world to be valued above the joys of heaven? Or are they worth the &s;ufferings of eternal &s;ire? Sirs, the&s;e que&s;tions &s;hould be con&s;idered before you go any further, by every man that hath rea&s;on to con&s;ider, and that believes he hath a &s;oul to &s;ave or lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, the Lord here &s;wearing that he hath no plea&s;ure in your death, but rather that you would
<PB N="56" REF="028243_0029_0FD746964F790770">turn and live; if yet you will go on and die rather than turn, remember it was not to plea&s;e God that you did it; it was to plea&s;e the world, and to plea&s;e your&s;elves. And if men will damn them&s;elves, to plea&s;e them&s;elves, and run into endle&s;s torments for delight, and have not the wit, the hearts, the grace, to hearken to God, or man, that would re|claim them, what remedy but they mu&s;t take what they get by it, and repent it in another manner, when it is too late! Before I proceed any further in the application, I &s;hall come to the next doctrine; which giveth me a fuller ground for it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Doct. 5.</HI> So earne&s;t is God for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, that he doubleth his commands and ex|hortations, with vehemency: Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</HEAD>
<P>THIS doctrine is the application of the former, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by a u&s;e of exhortation, and accordingly I &s;hall handle it. Is there ever an unconverted &s;inner that heareth the&s;e vehement words of God. Is there ever a man and woman in this a&s;&s;embly that is y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a &s;tranger to the renewing &s;anctifying work of the Holy Gho&s;t? (It is an happy a&s;&s;embly if it be not &s;o with the mo&s;t) hearken then to the voice of your Maker, and turn to him by Chri&s;t without delay. Would you know the will of God? Why this is his will, that you pre&s;ently turn. Shall the living God &s;end &s;o earne&s;t a me&s;&s;age to his creatures, and &s;hould they not obey? 2. Hearken, then, all you that live after the fle&s;h; the Lord that gave thee thy breath and being, hath &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to thee from heaven; and this is his me&s;&s;age, <HI>turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?</HI> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Shall the voice of the Eternal Maje&s;ty be neglected? If he do but terribly thunder, thou art afraid. O but this voice doth more nearly con|cern
<PB N="57" REF="028243_0029_0FD746964F790770">thee. If he did but tell thee, thou &s;halt die to|morrow, thou would&s;t not make light of it. O but this word concerneth thy life or death everla&s;ting. It is both a command and an exhortation. As if he &s;aid to thee, ["I charge thee upon the allegiance that thou owe&s;t to me thy Creator and Redeemer, that thou renounce the fle&s;h, the world and the devil, and turn to me that thou maye&s;t live. I con|de&s;cend to entreat thee, as thou either love&s;t or fear|e&s;t him that made thee; as thou love&s;t thine own life, even thine everla&s;ting life, turn and live; as ever thou would e&s;cape eternal mi&s;ery, turn, turn, for why wilt thou die?"] And is there a heart in man, in a rea&s;onable creature, that can once refu&s;e &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, &s;uch a command, &s;uch an exhorta|tion as this! O what a thing then is the heart of man!</P>
<P>Hearken, then, all that love your&s;elves, and all that regard your own &s;alvation; here is the joyful|le&s;t me&s;&s;age that ever was &s;ent to the ears of man, <HI>"Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?"</HI> You are not yet &s;hut up under de&s;peration. Here is mercy offered you; turn and you &s;hall have it. O, &s;irs, with what glad and joyful hearts &s;hould you receive the&s;e tidings! I know this is not the fir&s;t time that you have heard it; but how have you regarded it, or how do you regard it now? Hear all you igno|rant, carele&s;s &s;inners, the word of the Lord! Hear all you worldlings, you &s;en&s;ual fle&s;h plea&s;ers; you gluttons, and drunkards, and whore mongers, and &s;wearers; you railers and back biters, &s;landerers and liars, <HI>"Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?"</HI></P>
<P>Hear, all you cold and out&s;ide profe&s;&s;ors, and all that are &s;trangers to the life of Chri&s;t, and never knew the power of his cro&s;s and re&s;urrection, and never felt your hearts warmed with his love, and live not on him as the &s;trength of your &s;ouls, <HI>"Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?"</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="028243_0030_0FD746973257D910">
Hear, all that are void of the love of God, who&s;e hearts are not toward him, nor taken up with the hopes of glory, but &s;et more by your earthly pro&s;|perity and delights, than by the joys of heaven; all you that are religious but a little by the bye, and give God no more than your fle&s;h can &s;pare; that have not denied your carnal &s;elves, and for&s;aken all that you have for Chri&s;t, in the e&s;timation and grounded re&s;olution of your &s;ouls, but have &s;ome one thing in the world, &s;o dear to you, that you can|not &s;pare it for Chri&s;t, if he requited it, but will ra|ther venture on his di&s;plea&s;ure than for&s;ake it: <HI>"Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?"</HI></P>
<P>If you never heard it, or ob&s;erved it before, re|member that you were told from the word of God, this day, that if you will but turn you may live; and if you will not turn, you &s;hall &s;urely die.</P>
<P>What now will you do, &s;irs? What is your re|&s;olution? Will you turn, or will you not? Halt not any longer between two opinions: If the Lord be God, follow him; If your fle&s;h be God, then &s;erve it &s;till. If heaven be better than earth and fle&s;hy plea&s;ures, come away then and &s;eek a better country, and lay up your trea&s;ure where ru&s;t and moths do not corrupt, and thieves cannot break through and &s;teal, and be awakened, at la&s;t, with all your might, to &s;eek the kingdom that cannot be moved, Heb. xii. 28. and to employ your lives on a higher de&s;ign, and turn the &s;tream of your cares, and labours, another way than formerly you have done.

<P>For the principal inviter, it is God him&s;elf. He that commandeth heaven and earth, commands thee to turn; and pre&s;ently, without delay, to turn: He commands the &s;un to run its cour&s;e, and to ri&s;e upon thee every morning; and though it be &s;o glo|rious a creature, and many a time bigger than all the earth, yet it obeyeth him, and faileth not one minute of its appointed time. He commandeth all the planets, and the orbs of heaven, and they obey: He commandeth the &s;ea to ebb and flow, and the whole creation to keep its cour&s;e, and all obey him: The angels of heaven obey his will, when he &s;ends them to mini&s;ter to &s;uch &s;illy worms, as we on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rth, Heb. i. 14.

Well, Sirs, look inwards now, and tell me, how are your hearts affected with tho&s;e offers of the Lord? You hear what is his mind; he delight|eth not in your death; he calls to you turn, turn; it is a fearful &s;ign if all this move thee not; or if it do but half move thee, and much more, if it make thee more carele&s;s in thy mi&s;ery, becau&s;e thou heare&s;t of the mercifulne&s;s of God. The working of the medicine will partly tell us whe|ther there be any bope of the cure. O what glad tidings would it be to tho&s;e who are now in hell, if they had but &s;uch a me&s;&s;age from God! What a joyful word would it be to hear this, <HI>turn and live:</HI> Yea, what a welcome word would it be to thy&s;elf, when thou ha&s;t felt that wrath of God but an hour!

<P>Behold, &s;inners, we are &s;ent here, as the me&s;|&s;engers of the Lord, to &s;et before you life and death: What &s;ay you? Which of them will you choo&s;e?

It is the voice of love, of infinite love, of thy be&s;t and kinde&s;t friend, as thou mighte&s;t ea&s;ily perceive by the motion, and yet can&s;t thou neglect it?

<P>Moreover, this voice that calleth to thee, is the &s;ame that hath prevailed with thou&s;ands already, and called all to heaven than are now there; and they would not now, for a thou&s;and worlds, that they had made light of it, and not turned to God. Now what are they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that turned at God's call? Now perceive that it was indeed the voice of love that meant them no more harm than their &s;alvation, and if thou wilt obey the &s;ame call, thou &s;halt come to the &s;ame happine&s;s. There are mil|lions that mu&s;t for ever lament that they turned not; but there is never a &s;oul in heaven that is &s;orry that they were converted.</P>
<P>Well, &s;irs, are you yet re&s;olved, or are you not? Do I need to &s;ay any more to you, what will you do? Will you turn or not? Speak man in thy heart to God, though thou &s;peak not out to me: Speak, le&s;t he take thy &s;ilence for denial. Speak quickly, le&s;t he never make thee the like offer more. Speak re&s;olvedly, and not waveringly; for he will have no indifferents to be his followers. Say in thy heart now, without any more delay, even before thou &s;tir hence, "By the grace of God, I am re&s;olved pre&s;ently to turn. And be|cau&s;e I know my own in&s;ufficiency, I am re&s;olved to wait on God for his grace, and to follow him

<P>Sirs, you are not &s;hut up in the darkne&s;s of heatheni&s;m, nor in the de&s;peration of the damned; life is before you; and you may have it on rea&s;on|able terms, if you will, yea on free co&s;t if you will accept it.

<HEAD><HI>Doctrine 6.</HI> The Lord conde&s;cendeth to rea&s;on the ca&s;e with unconverted &s;inners; and to a&s;k them why they will die?</HEAD>
<P>A Strange di&s;putation it is, both as to the con|trover&s;y, and as to the di&s;putants.</P>
<P N="1">1. The controver&s;y, or que&s;tion propounded to di&s;pute of, is, <HI>Why wicked men will damn them|&s;elves?</HI> or, <HI>why they will rather die than turn;</HI> whether they have any &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>The di&s;putants are God and man, the mo&s;t holy God, and wicked unconverted &s;inners.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028243_0036_0FD746AF6B720648">
Is it not a &s;trange thing which God doth &s;eem here to &s;uppo&s;e, that any man &s;hould be willing to die, and be damned, yea, that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e of the wicked; that is, of the greate&s;t part of the world? but you will &s;ay, this cannot be; 'for nature de&s;ireth the pre&s;ervation and fe|licity of it&s;elf; and the wicked are more &s;elfi&s;h than others, and not le&s;s, and therefore how can any man be willing to be damned?'</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, 1. It is a certain truth that no man can be willing of any evil as evil, but only as it hath &s;ome appearance of good; much le&s;s can any man be willing to be eternally tormented. Mi&s;ery, as &s;uch, is de&s;ired by none. 2. But yet for all that, it is mo&s;t true which God here teacheth us, that the cau&s;e why the wicked die and are damned, is becau&s;e they will die and be damned. And this is true in &s;everal re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e they will go the way that leads to hell; though they are told by God and man, whi|ther it goes, and whither it ends, and though God hath &s;o often profe&s;&s;ed in his word, that if they hold on in that way, they &s;hall be condemned; and that they &s;hall not be &s;aved, unle&s;s they turn. I&s;a. xlviii. 22. and lvii. 21. <HI>There is no peace</HI> (&s;aith the Lord) <HI>unto the wicked,</HI> I&s;a. lix. 8. <HI>The way of peace they know not; there is no judgment in their goings; they have made them crocked paths: Who&s;oever goeth therein &s;hall not keep peace.</HI> They have the word, and the oath of the living God for it, that if they will not turn, they &s;hall not enter into his re&s;t. And yet wicked they are, and wicked they will be, let God and man &s;ay what they will; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;hy they are, and fle&s;hy they will be: World|lings
<PB N="72" REF="028243_0037_0FD746B0AFA54400">they are, and worldlings they will be, though God hath told them that <HI>the love of the world is enmity to God, and that if any man love the world,</HI> (in that mea&s;ure) <HI>the love of the father is not in him,</HI> Jam. iv. 4.1 John ii. 15. &s;o that con&s;equent|ly the&s;e men are willing to be damned, though not directly; they are willing of the way to hell, and love the certain cau&s;e of their torment; though they be not willing of hell it&s;elf, and do not love the pain which they mu&s;t endure.</P>
<P>Is not this the truth of your ca&s;e, &s;irs? You would not burn in hell, but you will kindle the fire by your &s;ins, and ca&s;t your&s;elves into it; you would not be tormented with devils forever, but you will do that which will certainly procure it is de&s;pight of all that can be &s;aid again&s;t it. It is ju&s;t as if you would &s;ay, "I will drink this rat&s;bane, or other poi&s;on, but yet I will not die: I will ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> my&s;elf headlong from the top of a &s;teeple, but yet I will not ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l my&s;elf: I will thru&s;t this knife into my heart, but yet I will not take away my life: I will put this fire into the thatch of my hou&s;e, but yet I will not burn it." Ju&s;t &s;o it is with wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men, they will be wicked, and they will live after the fle&s;h, and the world, and yet they would not be damned. But do you not know that the means do lead unto the end? and that God hath, by his righteous law, concluded that ye mu&s;t repent or peri&s;h? He that will take poi&s;on, may as well &s;ay plainly, I will kill my&s;elf, for it will prove no bet|ter in the end; though perhaps he loved it for the &s;weetne&s;s of the &s;ugar that was mixt with it; and would not be per&s;uaded that it was poi&s;on, but that he might take it and do well enough; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s is not
<PB N="73" REF="028243_0037_0FD746B0AFA54400">his conceits and confidence that will &s;ave his life. So if you will be drunkards, or fornicators, or wordlings, or live after the fle&s;h, you may as well &s;ay plainly, we will be damned, for &s;o you &s;hall be unle&s;s you turn. Would you not rebuke the folly of a thief or murderer, that would &s;ay, I will &s;teal, or kill, but I will not be hanged, when he knows that if he does the one, the judge in ju&s;tice &s;ees that the other be done? If he &s;ay I will &s;teal and murder, he may as well &s;ay plainly, I will be hanged; and if you will go on in a carnal life, you may as well &s;ay plainly, we will go to hell.</P>
<P N="2">2. Moreover, the wicked will not u&s;e the&s;e means, without which there is no hope of their &s;alvation: He that will not eat, may as well &s;ay plainly, he will not live, unle&s;s he can tell how to live without meat: He that will not go his jour|ney, may as well &s;ay plainly, he will not come to the end: He that falls into the water, and will not come out, nor &s;uffer another to help him out, may as well &s;ay plainly, he will be drowned. So if you be carnal and ungodly, and will not be con|verted, nor u&s;e the means by which you &s;hould be converted, but think it more ado than needs, you may as well &s;ay plainly, you will be damned; for if you have found out a way to be &s;aved without conver&s;ion, you have done that which was never done before.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yea, this is not all, but the wicked are un|willing, even of &s;alvation it&s;elf, tho' they may de|&s;ire &s;omewhat which they call by the name of Heaven, yet heaven it&s;elf, con&s;idered in the true nature of the felicity, they de&s;ire not; yea, their hearts are quite again&s;t it. Heaven is a &s;tate of
<PB N="74" REF="028243_0038_0FD746B2B9F956D0">perfect holine&s;s, and of continual love and prai&s;e to God, and the wicked have no heart to this. The imperfect love and prai&s;e, and holine&s;s which is here to be attained, they have no mind of; much le&s;s of that which is &s;o much greater; the joys of heaven are of &s;o pure and &s;piritual a na|ture, that the heart of the wicked cannot truly de|&s;ire them.</P>
<P>So that by this time you may &s;ee, upon what ground it is that God &s;uppo&s;eth, that the wicked are willing of their own de&s;truction: They will not turn, tho' they mu&s;t turn or die; they will ra|ther venture on certain mi&s;ery, than be convert|ed, and then, to quit them&s;elves in their &s;ins, they will make them&s;elves believe that they &s;hall ne|verthele&s;s e&s;cape.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as this controver&s;y is matter of wonder that ever men &s;hould be &s;uch enemies to them&s;elves, and wilfully to ca&s;t away their &s;ouls, &s;o are the di&s;|putants too. That God &s;hould &s;toop &s;o low, as thus to plead the ca&s;e with man, and that man &s;hould be &s;o &s;trangely blind and ob&s;tinate, as to need all this, in &s;o plain a ca&s;e; yea, and to re&s;i&s;t all this, when their own &s;alvation lieth upon the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>No wonder if they will not hear us, that are men, when they will not hear the Lord him|&s;elf: As God &s;aith, Ezek. iii. 7. when he &s;ent the prophet to the I&s;raelites. ["The hou&s;e of I&s;rael will not hearken unto thee: For they will not kearken unto me: For all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael are impudent and heard hearted."] No wonder if they can plead again&s;t a mini&s;ter, or a godly neighbour, when they will plead again&s;t the
<PB N="75" REF="028243_0038_0FD746B2B9F956D0">Lord him&s;elf, even again&s;t the plaine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of his word, and think that they have rea&s;on on their &s;ide: When they weary the Lord with their words, they &s;ay, <HI>wherein have we wearied him?</HI> Mal. ii. 17. The prie&s;t that de&s;pi&s;ed his name, dur&s;t a&s;k, "wherein have we de&s;pi&s;ed thy name? and when they polluted his altar, and made the tables of the Lord contemptible, they dur&s;t &s;ay, wherein have we polluted thee."

Let the pot&s;herds &s;trive with the pot&s;herds of the earth; &s;hall the clay &s;ay to him that fa&s;hi|oneth it, What make&s;t thou?" I&s;a. xiv. 9.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But why is it that God will rea&s;on the ca&s;e with man?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e that man being a rea&s;onable creature, is accordingly to be dealt with; and by rea&s;on to be per&s;uaded and overcome, God hath therefore endowed them with rea&s;on, that they might u&s;e it for him. One would think a rea&s;on|able creature &s;hould not go again&s;t the cleare&s;t and greate&s;t rea&s;on in the world when it is &s;et before him.</P>
<P N="2">2. At lea&s;t, men &s;hall &s;ee that God did require nothing of them that was unrea&s;onable; but that what he commandeth them, and whatever he for|biddeth them, he hath all the right rea&s;on in the world on his &s;ide; and they have good rea&s;on to obey him, but none to di&s;obey. And thus even the damned &s;hall be forced to ju&s;tify God, and confe&s;s that it was but rea&s;on that they &s;hould have turned to him; and they &s;hall be forced to condemn them&s;elves, and confe&s;s that they had

<P>LOOK upon your be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons, &s;inners, if you will make good your way, you &s;ee now with whom you have to deal. What &s;ay|e&s;t thou, unconverted &s;en&s;ual wretch?

But for a man to for&s;ake the Lord that made him, and for a man to run into the fire of hell, when he is told of it, and intreated to turn, that he may be &s;aved; this is a thing that can have no rea&s;on in the world, that is rea&s;on indeed, to ju&s;tify or excu&s;e it.

Dare you &s;tand to every one of the&s;e rea&s;ons at the bar of God? Do you think it will then &s;erve your turn, to-&s;ay, "Lord, I did not turn, becau&s;e I had &s;o much ado in the world, or becau&s;e I did not like the lives of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors, or becau&s;e I &s;aw men of &s;o many minds." O how ea&s;ily will the light of that day con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound and &s;hame &s;uch rea&s;onings as the&s;e! Had you the world to look after? Let the
<PB N="90" REF="028243_0046_0FD746D155B73440">world which you &s;erved now pay you your wa|ges, and &s;ave you if it can. Had you not a bet|ter world to look after fir&s;t, and were ye not commanded to &s;eek fir&s;t God's kingdom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and promi&s;ed that other things &s;hould be added to you, Matth. vi. 33. And were ye not told, that godline&s;s was profitable to all things, having the promi&s;e of this life, and of that which is to come? 1 Tim. iv. 8. Did the &s;ins of profe&s;&s;ors hinder you? You &s;hould rather have been the more heedful, and learned by their falls, to beware, and have been the more careful, and not to be more carele&s;s; it was the &s;cripture, and not their lives, that was your rule. Did the many opinions of the world hinder you? Why, the &s;cripture, that was your rule, did teach you but one way, and that was the right way. If you had followed that, even in &s;o much as was plain and ea&s;y, you &s;hould never have mi&s;carried. Will not &s;uch an&s;wers as the&s;e confound and &s;i|lence you? If the&s;e will not, God hath tho&s;e that will. When he a&s;ked the man, Matth. xxii. 12. 'Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment?' that is, what doe&s;t thou in my Church, among profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, with|out an holy heart and life; what an&s;wer did he make? Why the text &s;aith, he was &s;peechle&s;s; he had nothing to &s;ay. The clearne&s;s of the ca&s;e, and the maje&s;ty of God, will then ea&s;ily &s;top the mouths of the mo&s;t confident of you, though you will not be put down by any thing we can &s;ay to you now, but will make good your cau&s;e, be it never &s;o bad. I know already, that never a rea|&s;on that now ye can give me, will do you any

<P>Nay, I &s;carce think that your own con&s;cien|ces are well &s;atisfied with your rea&s;ons, for if they are, it &s;eems then you have not &s;o much as a purpo&s;e to repent. But if you do purpo&s;e to repent, it &s;eems you do not put much confidence in your rea&s;ons which you bring again&s;t it.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, unconverted &s;inners? Have you any good rea&s;ons to give, why you &s;hould not turn, and pre&s;ently turn with all your hearts? Or will you go to hell in de&s;pite of rea&s;on it&s;elf? Bethink you what you do in time, for it will &s;hortly be too late to bethink you. Can you find any fault with God, or his work, or his wages? Is he a bad ma&s;ter? Is the devil, whom you &s;erve, or is the fle&s;h a better? Is there any harm in an holy life? Is a life of worldline&s;s and ungodline&s;s better? Do you think in your con&s;ciences that it would do you any harm to be converted and live an holy life? What harm can it do to you? Is it harm to you to have the Spirit of Chri&s;t within you, and to have a clean&s;ed purified heart? If it be bad to be holy, why doth God &s;ay, 'be ye holy, for I am holy! 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. Lev. xx. 7. Is it evil to be like God? Is it not &s;aid, that God made man in his image? Why this holine&s;s is his image: this Adam lo&s;t, and this Chri&s;t, by his word and &s;pirit, would re&s;tore to you, as he doth to all that he will &s;ave. Why were you bapti&s;ed into the Holy Gho&s;t, and why do you bapti&s;e your children into the Holy Gho&s;t, as your Sanctifier, if you will not be &s;anctified by him, but think it an hurt to you to be &s;anctified?
<PB N="92" REF="028243_0047_0FD746D2D4C77158">Tell me truly, as before the Lord, though you are loth to live an holy life, had you not rather die in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e that do &s;o, than of others? If you were to die this day, had you not rather die in the ca&s;e of a converted man, than of the unconverted? of an holy and heavenly man, than of a carnal earthly man? And would you not &s;ay as Baalam, Num. xxiii. 10. 'Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his!' And why will you not now be of the mind that you will be of then? fir&s;t or la&s;t you mu&s;t come to this, either to be converted, or to wi&s;h you had been when it is too late.</P>
<P>But what is it that you are afraid of lo&s;ing if you turn? Is it your friends: you will but change them: God will be your friend, and Chri&s;t and the Spirit will be your friend, and every chri&s;tian will be your friend. You will get one friend that will &s;tand you in more &s;tead than all the friends in the world could have done. The friends you lo&s;e would have but enticed you to hell, but could not have delivered you; but the friend you get, will &s;ave you from hell, and bring you to his own eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P>Is it your plea&s;ures that you are afraid of lo&s;ing? You think you &s;hall never have a merry day again, if once you be converted. Alas, that you &s;hould think it a greater plea&s;ure to live in fooli&s;h &s;ports and merriments, and plea&s;e your fle&s;h, than live in the believing thoughts of glory, and in the love of God, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, in which the &s;tate of grace con&s;i&s;leth, Rom. xiv. 17. If it be a grea|ter plea&s;ure for you to think of your lands and
<PB N="93" REF="028243_0047_0FD746D2D4C77158">inheritance (if you were Lord of all the country) than it is to a child to play for pins; why &s;hould it not be a greater joy to you to think of the kingdom of Heaven being yours, than of all the riches or plea&s;ures of the world? As it is but fooli&s;h childi&s;hne&s;s that makes children &s;o delight in gauds, that they would not leave them for all your lands; &s;o it is but fooli&s;h worldline&s;s and fle&s;hline&s;s, and wickedne&s;s, that makes you &s;o much delight in your hou&s;es and lands, and meat and drink, and ea&s;e, and honour, as that you would not part with them for the heavenly de|lights. But what will you do for plea&s;ure, when the&s;e are gone? Do you not think of that? When your plea&s;ures end in horror, and go out with a &s;tinking &s;nuff, the plea&s;ures of the Saints are then at the be&s;t. I have had my&s;elf but a little ta&s;te of the heavenly plea&s;ures in the fore|thoughts of the ble&s;&s;ed approaching day, and in the pre&s;ent per&s;ua&s;ions of the love of God in Chri&s;t; but I have taken too deep a draught of earthly plea&s;ures, &s;o that you may &s;ee, if I be partial, it is on your &s;ide; and yet I mu&s;t profe&s;s from that little experience, that there is no com|pari&s;on; there is more joy to be had in a day (if the &s;un of life &s;hine clear upon us) in the &s;tate of holine&s;s, than in a whole life of &s;inful plea&s;ures. 'I had rather be a door keeper in the hou&s;e of God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedne&s;s. P&s;al. lxxxiv. 10.' 'A day in his courts is bet|ter than a thou&s;and any where el&s;e.' lxxxiv. 10. The mirth of the wicked is like the laughter of a madman, that knows not his own mi&s;ery; and therefore, Solomon faith of &s;uch labour, it is mad,
<PB N="94" REF="028243_0048_0FD746D41610BA38">and of mirth, what doth it? Eccle&s;. ii. 2. and Eccle&s;. vii. 2, 3.4, 5, 6. "It is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourning, than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is bet|ter than laughter: for by the &s;adne&s;s of the coun|tenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wi&s;e is in the hou&s;e of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the hou&s;e of mirth: It is bet|ter to bear the rebuke of the wi&s;e, than to hear the &s;ong of fools; for as the crackling of thorns under a pot, &s;o is the laughter of a fool." All the plea&s;ure of fle&s;hly things, is but like the &s;cratch|ing of a man that hath the itch; it is his di&s;ea&s;e that make him de&s;ire it, and a wi&s;e man had ra|ther be without his plea&s;ure, than be troubled with his itch.

<P>Que&s;t. "But how cometh it to pa&s;s, that men &s;hould be &s;o unrea&s;onable in the matters of &s;al|vation? They have wit enough in other matters, what makes them &s;o loth to be converted, that there &s;hould need &s;o many words in &s;o plain a ca&s;e, and all will not do, but the mo&s;t will live and die unconverted?"</P>
<P>An&s;w. To name them only in a few words, the cau&s;es are the&s;e:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Men are naturally in love with earth and fle&s;h, they are born &s;inners, and their nature hath an enmity to God and goodne&s;s, as the nature of a &s;erpent hath to a man; and when all that we can &s;ay goes again&s;t an habitual inclination of their natures, no marvel if it little prevail.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are in darkne&s;s, and know not the ve|ry things they hear. Like a man that was born blind, and hears a high commendation of the light; but what will hearing do, unle&s;s he &s;ees it. They know not what God is, nor what is the power of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, nor what the &s;pirit of holine&s;s is, nor what it is to live in love by faith: They know not the certainty, and &s;uit|ablene&s;s, and excellency of the heavenly inherit|ance. They know not what conver&s;ion, and a holy mind and conver&s;ation is, even when they hear of it. They are in a mi&s;t of ignorance. They are lo&s;t and bewildered in &s;in; like a man that has lo&s;t him&s;elf in the night, and knows not where he is, nor how to come to him&s;elf again, till the day light do recover him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They are wilfully confident, that they need
<PB N="96" REF="028243_0049_0FD746D6A9CF8590">no conver&s;ion, but &s;ome partial amendment; and that they are in the way to heaven already; and are converted, when they are not. And if you meet a man that is quite out of his way, you may long enough call upon him to turn back again, if he will not believe you, that he is out of the way.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They are become &s;laves to their fle&s;h, and drowned in the world, to make provi&s;ion for it. Their lu&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ions, and appetites have di&s;|tracted them, and got &s;uch an hand over them, that they cannot tell how to deny them, or how to mind any thing el&s;e, &s;o that the drunkard &s;aith, 'I love a cup of good drink, and I cannot forbear it." The glutton &s;aith, 'I love good chear, and I cannot forbear.' The fornicator &s;aith, 'I love to have my lu&s;t fulfilled, and I can|not forbear.' And the game&s;ter loves to have his &s;ports, and he cannot forbear. So that they are become even captivated &s;laves to their fle&s;h, and their very wilfulne&s;s is become an impotency, and what they would not do, they &s;ay they can|not. And the worldling is &s;o taken up with earthly things, that he hath neither heart nor mind, nor time for heavenly; but as in Pharaoh's dream, Gen. xli. 4. the lean kine did eat up the fat ones; &s;o this lean and barren earth doth eat up all the thoughts of heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Some are &s;o carried away by the &s;tream of evil company, that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with hard thoughts of a godly life, by hearing them &s;peak again&s;t it! or at lea&s;t, they think they may ven|ture to do as they &s;ee mo&s;t do, and &s;o they hold on in their &s;inful ways: and when one is cut off,
<PB N="97" REF="028243_0049_0FD746D6A9CF8590">and ca&s;t into hell, and another &s;natched away from among them, to the &s;ame condemnation, it doth not much daunt them, becau&s;e they &s;ee not whither they are gone; poor wretches, they hold on in their ungodline&s;s, for all this; for they little know that their companions are now lamenting it in torments. In Luke xvi. the rich man in hell would &s;ain have had one to warn his five brethren, le&s;t they &s;hould come to that place of torment. Its like he knew their minds and lives, and knew that they were ha&s;ting thither, and little dreamt that he was there, yea, and would little have believed one that &s;hould have told them &s;o. I remember a pa&s;&s;age that a gentleman, yet living, told me he &s;aw upon a bridge over Se|vern. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. R. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y, of Shrew&s;bury, upon Acham-bridge.</NOTE> A man was driving a flock of fat lambs, and &s;omething meeting them, and hindering their pa&s;&s;age, one of the lambs leapt upon the wall of the bridge, and his legs &s;lipping from under him, he fell into the &s;tream; the re&s;t &s;eeing him, did, one after one leap over the bridge into the &s;tream, and were all, or almo&s;t all drowned; tho&s;e that were behind, did little know what was become of them that were gone before; but thought they might venture to follow their companions; but as &s;oon as over the wall, and falling headlong, the ca&s;e was altered. Even &s;o it is with uncon|verted carnal men. One dieth by them, and drops into hell, and another follows the &s;ame way: and yet they will go after them, becau&s;e they think not whither they are gone. Oh, but when death hath once opened their eyes, and they &s;ee what
<PB N="98" REF="028243_0050_0FD746D7B22A77E0">is on the other &s;ide of the wall; even in another world, then what would they give to be where they were!</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Moreover, they have a &s;ubtle malicious enemy, that is un&s;een of them, and plays his game in the dark; and it is his principal bu&s;i|ne&s;s to hinder their conver&s;ion; and therefore to keep them where they are, by per&s;uading them not to believe the &s;criptures, or not to trouble their minds with the&s;e matters; or, by per&s;uad|ing them, to think ill of a godly life, or to think that its more ado than needs, and that they may be &s;aved without conver&s;ion, and without all this &s;tir: and, that God is &s;o merciful, that he will not damn any &s;uch as they; or, at lea&s;t, that they may &s;tay a little longer, and take their plea&s;ure, and follow the world a little longer yet, and then let it go, and repent hereafter. And by &s;uch jug|gling deluding cheats as the&s;e, the devil keeps the your in his captivity, and leadeth them to his mi&s;ery.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like impediments as the&s;e, do keep &s;o many thou&s;ands unconverted, when God hath done &s;o much, and Chri&s;t hath &s;uffer|ed &s;o much, and mini&s;ters have &s;aid &s;o much, for their conver&s;ion; when their rea&s;ons are &s;ilenced, and they are not able to an&s;wer the Lord that calls after them, 'Turn ye, turn ye; why will you die?' Yet all comes to nothing with the greate&s;t part of them; and they leave us no more to do after all, but to &s;it down, and lament their wilful mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I have now &s;hewed you the rea&s;onablene&s;s of God's commands, and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of
<PB N="99" REF="028243_0050_0FD746D7B22A77E0">wicked men's di&s;obedience. If nothing will &s;erve turn, but men will yet refu&s;e to turn, we are next to con&s;ider, who it is long of, if they be damn|ed. And this brings me the la&s;t doctrine, which is,</P>

They cry out upon God, and &s;ay, he gives them not grace, and his threatnings are &s;evere, and God forbid that all &s;hould be damned that be not converted and &s;anctified; and they think it a hard mea&s;ure that a &s;hort &s;in &s;hould have an endle&s;s &s;uffering; and if they be damned, they &s;ay they cannot help it, when in the mean time, they are bu&s;y about their de&s;truction, even cutting the throat of their own &s;ouls, and will not be per&s;uaded to hold their hands. They think <HI>God</HI> were <HI>cruel,</HI> if he &s;hould damn them; and yet they are &s;o cruel to them&s;elves, that they will run into the fire of hell when God hath told them it is a little before them, and neither intreaties, nor threatnings nor any thing that can be &s;aid, will &s;top them.

O wilful wretched &s;inners! It is not God that is cruel to you, it is you that are cruel to your&s;elves; you are told, you mu&s;t turn or burn, and yet you turn not. You are told, that if you will needs keep your &s;ins, you &s;hall keep the cur&s;e of God with them; and yet you will keep them.

He offereth it to you, and you will not have it. You are in the ditch-of &s;in and mi&s;ery, and he would give you his hand to help you out, and you refu&s;e his help; he would clean&s;e you of your &s;ins, and you had rather keep them! you love your lu&s;t, and love your gluttony and &s;ports, and drunkenne&s;s, and will not let them go; would you have him bring you to heaven, whether you would or no; or would you have him bring you and your &s;ins to heaven together?

From hence al&s;o you may learn, that it is no great wonder if wicked men be hinderers of others in the way to heaven, and would have as many unconverted as they can, and would draw them into &s;in, and keep them in it! Can you ex|pect that they &s;hould have mercy on others, that have none upon them&s;elves? And that they &s;hould much &s;tick at the de&s;truction of others, that &s;tick
<PB N="115" REF="028243_0058_0FD746E9A927EF38">not to de&s;troy them&s;elves! That do no wor&s;e by others, than they do by them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, you may hence learn, that the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nemy to man is him&s;elf, and the great|e&s;t judgment in this life that can befal him, is to be left to him&s;elf, and that the greate&s;t work that grace hath to do, is to &s;ave us from our|&s;elves, and the greate&s;t accu&s;ations and complaints of men &s;hould be again&s;t them&s;elves, and that the greate&s;t work we have to do our&s;elves, is to re&s;i&s;t our&s;elves, and the greate&s;t enemy that we &s;hould daily pray, and watch, and &s;trive again&s;t, is our own carnal hearts and wills, and the great|e&s;t part of your work, if you would do good to others, and help them to heaven, is to &s;ave them from them&s;elves, even from their blind under|&s;tandings and corrupted wills, and perver&s;e af|fections, and violent pa&s;&s;ions, and unruly &s;en&s;es. I only name all the&s;e for brevity &s;ake, and leave them to your further con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Well, &s;irs, now we have found out the great delinquent, and murderer of &s;ouls, (even men's &s;elves, their own wills) what remains but that you judge according to the evidence, and con|fe&s;s this great iniquity before the Lord, and be humbled for it, and do &s;o no more? To the&s;e three ends di&s;tinctly, I &s;hall add a few words more.

<P N="1">1. We know &s;o much of the exceeding graci|ous nature of God, who is willing to do good, and delighteth to &s;hew mercy, that we have no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of being the culpable cau&s;e
<PB N="116" REF="028243_0059_0FD746EC385687F8">of our death, or to call him cruel&punc; he made all good, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pre&s;erveth and maintaineth all; the eyes of all things do w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t upon him, and he giveth them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> open|eth his hand, and &s;atisfieth the de&s;ires of all the living.

P&s;al. xiv. 5, 17, 19.</P>
<P>But as for man, we know his mind is dark, his will perver&s;e, and his affections carry him &s;o headlong, that he is fitted by his folly and cor|ruption to &s;uch a work as the de&s;troying of him|&s;elf. If you &s;aw a lamb lie killed in the way, would you &s;ooner &s;u&s;pect the &s;heep, or the dog, or wolf, to be the author of it, if they both &s;tand by? Or if you &s;ee an hou&s;e broken, and the peo|ple murdered, would you &s;ooner &s;u&s;pect the prince or judge, that is wi&s;e and ju&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d no need, or a known thief or murderer? I &s;ay therefore, us Jam. i. 13, 14, 15. "Let no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ay when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempt|eth he any man," to draw him to &s;in, but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t, and enticed. Then when lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth &s;in; and &s;in when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death." You &s;ee here, that &s;in is the brat of your own concupi&s;cence, and not to be fathered on God, and that death is the offspring of your own &s;in, and the fruit which it will yield you as &s;oon as it is ripe. You
<PB N="117" REF="028243_0059_0FD746EC385687F8">have a trea&s;ure of evil in your&s;elves, as a &s;pider bath of poi&s;on, from whence you are bringing forth hurt to your&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lves, and &s;pinning &s;uch webs as entangle your own &s;ouls. Your nature &s;hews it is you that are the cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is evident that you are your own de&s;troy|ers, in that you are &s;o ready to entertain any temptation almo&s;t that is offered you. Satan is &s;carce readier to move you to any evil, than you are ready to hear, and do as he would have you. If he would tempt your under&s;tanding to error and prejudice, you yield. If he would hinder you from good re&s;olutions, it is &s;oon done. If he would cool any good de&s;ires or affections, it is &s;oon done. If he would kindle any lu&s;t, or vile affections and de&s;ires in you, it is &s;oon done. If he will put you on to evil thoughts, or deeds, you are &s;o free, that he needs no rod nor &s;pur. If he would keep you from holy thoughts and words, and ways, a little doth it, you need no curb. You examine not his &s;ugge&s;tions, nor re|&s;i&s;t them with any re&s;olution, nor ca&s;t them out as he ca&s;ts them in, nor quench the &s;parks which he endeavoureth to kindle; but you &s;et in with him, and meet him half way, and embrace his motions, and tempt him to tempt you. And it is ea&s;y to catch &s;uch greedy fi&s;h that are ranging for a bait, and will take the bare hook.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your de&s;truction is evidently long of your|&s;elves, in that you re&s;i&s;t all that would help to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you, and would do you good, or hinder you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> undoing your&s;elves.

<PB N="118" REF="028243_0060_0FD746ED5E3E62C8">&s;pirit, and you re&s;i&s;t and quench it. If any man reprove you for your &s;in, you fly in his face with evil words; and if he would draw you to an holy life, and tell you of your pre&s;ent danger, you give him little thanks, but either bid him look to him&s;elf, he &s;hall not an&s;wer for you, or el&s;e, at be&s;t, you put him off with an heartle&s;s thanks, and will not turn when you are per&s;uaded. If mini&s;ters would privately in&s;truct and help you, you will not come at them; your unhumbled &s;ouls do feel but little need of their help; if they would catechi&s;e you, you are too old to be cate|chi&s;ed, though you are not too old to be igno|rant and unnoly. Whatever they can &s;ay to you for your good, you are &s;o &s;elf-conceited and wi&s;e in your own eyes, even in the depth of igno|rance, that you well regard nothing that agreeth not with your pre&s;ent conceits, but contradict your teachers, as if you were wi&s;er than they; you re&s;i&s;t all that they can &s;ay to you, by your ignorance, and wilfulne&s;s, and fooli&s;h cavils, and &s;hifting eva&s;ions, and unthankful rejections, &s;o that no good that is offered, can find any wel|come acceptance and entertainment with you.</P>
<P N="4">4. Moreover, it is apparent, that you are &s;elf-de&s;troyers, in that you <HI>draw the matter of your &s;in and de&s;truction even from the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf.</HI> You like not the contrivances of his wi&s;dom; you like not his ju&s;tice, but take it for cruelty; you like not his holine&s;s, but are ready to think he is &s;uch a one as your&s;elves, P&s;al. l. 21. and makes as light of &s;in as you: you like not his truth, but would have his threatenings, even his pretemptory threatenings prove fal&s;e.

<P N="5">5. Yea, you <HI>fetch de&s;truction from the ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer, and death from the Lord of Life him&s;elf.</HI> And nothing more emboldeneth you in &s;in, than that Chri&s;t hath died for you; as if now the dan|ger of death were over, and you might boldly venture; as if Chri&s;t were become a &s;ervant to &s;atan and your &s;ins, and mu&s;t wait upon you while you are abu&s;ing him; and becau&s;e he is be|come the phy&s;ician of &s;ouls, and is able to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t, all that come to God by him; you think he mu&s;t &s;uffer you to refu&s;e his help, and throw away his medicines, and mu&s;t &s;ave you whether you will come to God by him or no, &s;o that a great part of your &s;ins are occa&s;ioned by your bold pre&s;umption upon the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Not con&s;idering that he came to redeem his people from their &s;ins, and to &s;anctify them a pe|culiar people to him&s;elf, and to conform them in holine&s;s to the image of their heavenly father, and to their head, Matth. i. 21. Tit. ii. 14. 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. Col. iii. 10, 11. Phil. iii. 9, 10.</P>
<P N="6">6. You al&s;o fetch your own de&s;truction from all the providences and works of God. When you think of his eternal fore-knowledge and de|crees, it is to harden you in your &s;in, or po&s;&s;e&s;s your minds in quarrelling thoughts, as if his de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rees might &s;pare you the labour of repentance,

If he afflict you, you repine; if he pro&s;per you, you the more forget him, and are the back warder to the thoughts of the life to come. If the wicked pro&s;per, you forget the end, that will &s;et all reckoning &s;traight; and are ready to think it is as good to be wicked as godly. And thus you draw your death from all.</P>
<P N="7">7. And the like you do from all the creatures and mercies of God to you. He giveth them to you as the tokens of his love, and furniture of his &s;ervice, and you turn them again&s;t him, to the plea&s;ing of your fle&s;h; you eat and drink to plea&s;e your appetite, and not for the glory of God, and to enable you for his work. Your clothes you abu&s;e to pride. Your riches draw your hearts from heaven; Phil. iii. 18. Your honours and applau&s;e do puff you up; if you have health and &s;trength, it makes you more &s;e|cure, and forget your end. Yea, other mens mercies are abu&s;ed by you to your hurt. If you &s;ee their honours and dignity, you are provoked to envy them. If you &s;ee their riches, you are ready to covet them. If you look upon beauty, you are &s;tirred up to lu&s;t. And it is well, if god|line&s;s be not an eye &s;ore to you.</P>
<P N="8">8. The very gifts that God be&s;toweth on you and the ordinances of grace which he hath in&s;ti|tuted for his church, you turn to &s;in. If you have better parts than others, you grow proud, and &s;elf-conceited: If you have but common gifts, you take them for &s;pecial grace.

If they &s;peak gently, or coldly, you either &s;leep under them, or are little more effected than the &s;eats you &s;it upon. If any errors creep into the church, &s;ome greedily entertain them, and others reproach the Chri&s;tian doctrine for them, which is mo&s;t again&s;t them. And if we would draw you from any ancient rooted error, which can but plead two, or three, or &s;ix, or &s;even hundred years cu&s;tom, you are as much offended with a motion for reformation, as if you were to lo&s;e your life by it, and hold fa&s;t old errors, while you cry out again&s;t new ones. Scarce a difference can ari&s;e among the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, but you will fetch your own death from it. And you will not hear, or at lea&s;t not obey the unque&s;ti|onable doctrine of any of tho&s;e that jump not with your conceirs: one will not hear a mini|&s;ter, becau&s;e he &s;aith the Lord's prayer; and another will not hear him, becau&s;e he doth not u&s;e it. One will not hear them that are for epi&s;|copacy, and another will not hear them that are again&s;t it. And thus I might &s;hew it you in ma|ny other ca&s;es, how you turn all that comes near you to your own de&s;truction: &s;o clear it is, that the ungodly are &s;elf-de&s;troyers, and that their perdition is of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Methinks now, upon the con&s;ideration of what is &s;aid, and the review of your own ways, you &s;hould bethink you what you have done, and be a&s;hamed, and deeply humbled, to remember it. If you be not, I pray you con&s;ider the&s;e follow|ing truths:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To be your own de&s;troyers, it to &s;in again&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="028243_0062_0FD746F89F6B9440">the deepe&s;t principle of your natures, even the principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation. Every thing na|turally de&s;ireth or inclineth to its own felicity, welfare, or perfection. And will you &s;et your|&s;elves to your own de&s;truction? When you are commanded to love your neighbours as your|&s;elves; it is &s;uppo&s;ed that you naturally love your&s;elves. But if you love your neighbours no better than your&s;elves, it &s;eems, you would have all the world damned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How extremely do you cro&s;s your own in|tentions? I know you intend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> your own damnation, ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n when you are procuring it; you think you are but doing good to your&s;elves, by gratifying the de&s;ires of your fle&s;h. But alas, it is but as a draught or cold water in a burning fever, or as the &s;cratching of an itching wild fire, which increa&s;eth the di&s;ea&s;e and pain. If indeed you would have plea&s;ure, profit, or ho|nour, &s;eek them where they are to be found, and do not hunt after them in the way to hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What pity is it, that you &s;hould do that again&s;t your&s;elves, which none el&s;e in earth or hell can do! If all the world were combined a|gain&s;t you, or all the devils in hell were com|bined again&s;t you, they could not de&s;troy you without your&s;elves, nor make you &s;in but by your own con&s;ent. And will you do that a gain&s;t your&s;elves which no one el&s;e can do; you have hateful thoughts of the devil, becau&s;e he is your en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">my, and endeavoureth your de&s;truc|tion. And will you be wor&s;e than devils to your&s;elves? Why, it is thus with you, if you had hearts to under&s;tand it: When you run into
<PB N="124" REF="028243_0063_0FD746FB85F17C00">&s;in, and run from godline&s;s, and refu&s;e to turn at the call of God, you do more again&s;t your own &s;ouls than men or devils could do be&s;ides, and if you &s;hould &s;et your&s;elves, and bend your wits to do your&s;elves the greate&s;t mi&s;chief, you could not devi&s;e to do a greater.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. You are fal&s;e to the tru&s;t that God hath re|po&s;ed in you. He hath much intru&s;ted you with your own &s;alvation, and will you betray your tru&s;t? He hath &s;et you with all diligence to keep your hearts, and is this the keeping of them? Prov. iv. 23.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. You do even forbid all others to pity you, when you will have no pity on your&s;elves; if you cry to God in the day of your calamity for mercy, mercy; what can you expect but that he &s;hould thru&s;t you away, and &s;ay, "nay, thou would&s;t not have mercy on thy&s;elf; who brought this upon thee but thy own wilfulne&s;s?" And if your brethren &s;ee you everla&s;tingly in mi&s;ery, how &s;hall they pity you that were your own de|&s;troyers, and would not be di&s;&s;uaded?</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. It will everla&s;tingly make you your own tormentors in hell to think on it, that you brought your&s;elves wilfully to that mi&s;ery. O what a griping thought it will be for ever to think with your&s;elves, that this was your own doing! that you were warned of this day, and warned again, but it would not do: that you wilfully &s;inned, and wilfully turned away from God! that you had time as well as others but you abu&s;ed it; you had teachers as well as o|thers, but you refu&s;ed their in&s;truction; you had holy examples, but you did not imitate them;
<PB N="125" REF="028243_0063_0FD746FB85F17C00">you were offered Chri&s;t, and grace, and glory, as well as others, but you had more mind of your fle&s;hly plea&s;ure; you had a price in your hands, but you had not a heart to lay it out. Prov. xvii. 16. Can it choo&s;e but torment you to think of this your pre&s;ent folly? O that your eyes were opened to &s;ee what you have done in the wilful wronging of your own &s;ouls! and that you better under&s;tood the&s;e words of God, "Prov. viii. 33, 34, 35, 36.

<P>And now I am come to the conclu&s;ion of this work; my heart is troubled to think how I &s;hall leave you, le&s;t, after this, the fle&s;h &s;hould &s;till deceive you, and the world and the devil &s;hould keep you a&s;leep, and I &s;hould leave you as I found you, till you awake in hell.

Now, if I could but get you to be wil|ling, to be thoroughly and re&s;olvedly, and ha|bitually willing, the work were more than half done. And alas, mu&s;t we lo&s;e our friends, and mu&s;t they lo&s;e their God, their happine&s;s, their &s;ouls, for want of this? God forbid? It is a &s;trange thing to me that men are &s;o inhuman and &s;tupid in the greate&s;t matters, that in le&s;&s;er things are civil and courteous, and good neighbours. For ought I know, I have the love of all, or al|mo&s;t all my neighbours, &s;o far, that if I &s;hould &s;end to every man in the town, or pari&s;h, or country, and reque&s;t a rea&s;onable courte&s;y of them, they would grant it me; and yet when I come to reque&s;t of them the greate&s;t matter in the world for them&s;elves, and not for me, I can have nothing of many of them but a patient hearing. I know not whether people think a man in the pulpit is in good &s;adne&s;s or not, and means as he &s;peaks; for I think I have few neigh|bours, but if I were &s;itting familiarly with them, and telling them of what I have &s;een or done, or known in the world, they would believe me, and regard what I &s;ay; but when I tell them, from the infallible word of God, what they them&s;elves &s;hall &s;ee and know in the world to come, they &s;hew by their lives they do either not believe it, or not much regard it. If I met ever any one of them on the way, and told them yonder is a coal pit, or there is a quick&s;and, or

But when I tell them that &s;atan lieth in wait for them, and that &s;in is poi&s;on to them, and that hell is not a matter to be je&s;ted with, they go on as if they did not hear me. Truly neighbours, I am in as good earne&s;t with you in the pulpit, as I am in my familiar di&s;cour&s;e: and if ever you will regard me, I be&s;eech you let it be here. I think there is never a man of you all, but if my own &s;oul lay at your wills, you would be willing to &s;ave it (though I cannot promi&s;e that you would leave your &s;ins for it.) Tell me, thou drunkard, art thou &s;o cruel to me that &s;peak to thee, that thou woulde&s;t not forbear a few cups of drink, if thou knewe&s;t it would &s;ave my &s;oul from hell! Had&s;t thou rather that I did burn there for ever, than thou &s;hould&s;t live &s;oberly as other men do? If &s;o, may I not &s;ay, thou art an unmerciful mon&s;ter, and not a man? If I came hungry or naked to one of your doors, would you not part with more than a cup of drink to relieve me? I a in confident you would; If it were to &s;ave my life, I know you would (&s;ome of you) hazard your own.

I profe&s;s to you, firs, I am as hearty a beggar with you this day for the &s;aving of your own &s;ouls, as I would be for my own &s;upply if I were forced to come a begging to your doors. And therefore if you would hear me then, heat
<PB N="129" REF="028243_0065_0FD746FDDFAE6D88">me now. If you would pity me then, be intreat|ed now to pity your&s;elves. I do again be&s;eech you, as if it were on my bended knees, that you would hearken to your redeemer, and, turn that you may live. All you that have lived in ignorance, and carele&s;sne&s;s, and pre&s;umption, to this day; all you that have been drowned in the care of the world, and have no mind of God, and eternal glory; all you that are en&s;laved to your fle&s;hly de&s;ires, of meat and drink, &s;ports and lu&s;ts; and all you that know not the nece&s;|&s;ity of holine&s;s, and never were acquainted with the &s;anctifying work of the Holy Gho&s;t upon your &s;ouls, that never embraced your ble&s;&s;ed re|deemer by a lively faith, and with admiring and thankful apprehen&s;ions of his love, and that ne|ver felt an higher e&s;timation of God &amp; heaven, and an heartier love to them than to your fle&s;hly pro&s;perity, and the things below; I earne&s;tly be&s;eech you, not only for my &s;ake, but for the Lord's &s;ake, that you go not one day longer in your former condition, but look about you, and cry to God for converting grace, that you be made new creatures, and may e&s;cape the plagues that are a little before you. And if ever you will do any thing for me, grant me this reque&s;t, to turn from your evil ways and live. Deny me any thing that ever I &s;hall a&s;k you for my&s;elf, if you will but grant me this. And if you deny me this, I care not for any thing el&s;e that you would grant me. Nay, as ever you will do any thing at the reque&s;t of the Lord that made you, and redeemed you, deny him not this; for if you deny him this, he cares for nothing that you

As ever you would have him hear you prayers, and grant your reque&s;ts, and do for you at the hour of death and day of judg|ment, or in any of your extremities, deny not his reque&s;t in the day of your pro&s;perity. O &s;its, believe it, death and judgment, and hea|ven and hell, are other matters when you come hear them, than they &s;eem to carnal eyes afar off; then you would hear &s;uch a me&s;&s;age as I bring you with more a wakoned regardful hearts.</P>
<P>Well, though I cannot hope &s;o well of all, I will hope that &s;ome of you are by this time pur|po&s;ing to turn and live; and that you are ready to a&s;k me, as the Jews did Peter, Acts ii. 37. When they were pricked in their hearts, and &s;aid, "men and brethren, what &s;hall we do? How might we come to be truly converted? We are willing, if we did but know our duty. God forbid that we &s;hould choo&s;e de&s;truction, by re|fu&s;ing conver&s;ion, as hitherto we have done.</P>
<P>If the&s;e be the thoughts and purpo&s;es of your hearts, I &s;ay of you as God did of a promi&s;ing people, Deut. v. 28, 29. They have well &s;aid all that they have &s;poken; "O that there were &s;uch a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always!" Your purpo&s;es are good: O that there were but an heart in you to perform the&s;e purpo&s;es! And in hope hereof, I &s;hall gladly give you direction what to do, and that but briefly, that you may the ea&s;ier remember it for your practice.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would be converted and &s;aved, labour to under&s;tand the nece&s;&s;ity and true nature of conver&s;ion; for what, and from what, and to what, and by what it is, that you mu&s;t turn.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider what a lamentable condition you are in till the hour of your conver&s;ion, that you may &s;ee it is not a &s;tate to be re&s;ted in. You are un|der the guilt of all the &s;ins that ever you com|mitted, and under the wrath of God, and the cur&s;e of his law, you are bound &s;laves to the de|vil, and daily employed in his work again&s;t the Lord, your&s;elves, and others; you are &s;piritual|ly dead and deformed, as being devoid of the holy life, and nature, and image of the Lord. You are unfit for any holy work, and do nothing that is truly plea&s;ing unto God. You are with|out any promi&s;e or a&s;&s;urance of his protection, and live in continual danger of his ju&s;tice, not knowing what hour you may be &s;watched away to hell, and mo&s;t certain to be damned if you die in that condition, and nothing &s;hort of con|ver&s;ion can prevent it. Whatever civilities, or amendments, or ventures, are &s;hort of true con|ver&s;ion, will never procure the &s;aving of your &s;ouls. Keep the true &s;en&s;e of this natural mi&s;ery, and &s;o of the nece&s;&s;ity of conver&s;ion on your hearts.</P>
<P>And then you mu&s;t under&s;tand what it is to be converted. It is to have a new heart or di&s;po&s;iti|on, and a new conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>For what mu&s;t we turn?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> For the&s;e ends following, which you
<PB N="132" REF="028243_0067_0FD71F750290EFC8">may attain; 1. You &s;hall immediately be made living members of Chri&s;t, and have intere&s;t in him, and be renewed after the image of God, and be adorned with all his graces and quickened with a new and heavenly life, and &s;aved from the tyranny of &s;atan, and the dominion of &s;in, and be ju&s;tified from the cur&s;e of the law, and have the pardon of all the &s;ins of your whole lives, and be accepted of God, and made his &s;ons, and have liberty with boldne&s;s to call him father, and go to him by prayer in all your needs, with a promi&s;e of acceptance; you &s;hall have the Holy Gho&s;t to dwell in you, to &s;anctify and guide you! You &s;hall have part in the bro|therhood, communion and prayers of the &s;aints? You &s;hall be fitted for God's &s;ervice, and be freed from the dominion of &s;in, and be u&s;eful and a ble&s;&s;ing to the place you live in; and &s;hall have the promi&s;e of this life and that which is to come. You &s;hall want nothing that is truly good for you, and your nece&s;&s;ary afflictions you will be enabled to bear; you may have &s;ome ta&s;te of communion with God in the &s;pirit; e&s;pecially in all holy ordinances, where God prepareth a fea&s;t for your &s;ouls; you &s;hall be heirs of heaven while you live on earth, and may fore&s;ee by faith the everla&s;ting glory, and &s;o may live and die in peace; and you &s;hall never be &s;o low, but your happine&s;s will be incomparably greater than your mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>How precious is every one of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which I do but briefly name, and which in this life you may receive!</P>
<P>And then, 2. At death you &s;ouls &s;hall go to

<P N="2">2. Your employment &s;hall be to behold your glorified Redeemer, with all your holy fellow|citizens of heaven, and to &s;ee the glory of the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed God, and to love him perfectly, and be loved by him, and to prai&s;e him everla&s;t|ingly.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your glory will contribute to the glory of the New Jeru&s;alem, the city of the living God, which is more than to have a private felicity to your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. Your glory will contribute to the glorify|ing of your Redeemer, who will everla&s;tingly be magnified and plea&s;ed in you that are the travail of his &s;oul; and this is more than the glorifying of your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5. And the eternal maje&s;ty, the living God, will be glorified in your glory, both as he is magnified by prai&s;es, and as he communicateth of his glory and goodne&s;s to you, and as he is plea&s;ed in you, and in the accompli&s;hment of his
<PB N="134" REF="028243_0068_0FD74704EF97F9A8">glorious works, in the glory of the New Jeru&s;a|lem and of his Son.</P>
<P>All this the poore&s;t beggar of you that is con|verted, &s;hall certainly and endle&s;sly enjoy.</P>
<P N="2">2. You &s;ee for what you mu&s;t turn! Next, you mu&s;t under&s;tand from what you mu&s;t turn; And that is, in a word, from your carnal &s;elf, which is the end of all the unconverted. From the fle&s;h that would be plea&s;ed before God, and would &s;till be enticing you thereto. From the world that is the bait; and from the devil, that is the angler of &s;ouls, and the deceiver. And &s;o from all known and wilful &s;ins.</P>
<P N="3">3. Next you mu&s;t know to what end you mu&s;t turn; and that is, to God as your end; to Chri&s;t as the way to the Father, to holine&s;s as the way appointed you by Chri&s;t; and &s;o the u&s;e of all the helps and means of grace afforded you by the Lord.</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, you mu&s;t know, by what you mu&s;t turn. And that is by Chri&s;t as the only Redeem|er and Interce&s;&s;or, and by the Holy Gho&s;t as the Sanctifier, and by the word as his in&s;trument or means, and by faith and repentance as the means and duties on your part to be performed. All this is of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>IF you will be converted and &s;aved, be much in &s;ecret &s;erious con&s;ideration. Incon&s;iderate|ne&s;s undoes the world. Withdraw your&s;elves oft into retired &s;ecrecy, and there bethink you of the end why you were made, of the life you have
<PB N="135" REF="028243_0068_0FD74704EF97F9A8">lived, the time you have lo&s;t, the &s;in you have committed, of the love and &s;ufferings, and ful|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, of the danger you are in, of the nearne&s;s of death and judgment; and of the cer|tainty and excellency of the joys of heaven, and of the certainty and terror of the torment of hell, and eternity of both, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of con|ver&s;ion and a holy life. Steep your hearts in &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>IF you will be converted and &s;aved, attend up|on the word of God, which is the ordinary means. Read the &s;cripture, or hear it read, and other holy writings that do apply it con&s;tantly; attend on the public preaching of the word. As God will light the world by the &s;on, and not by him&s;elf without, &s;o will he convert and &s;ave men by his mini&s;ters, who are the lights of the world, Acts xxvi. 17, 18. Matt. v. 14. When he hath miraculou&s;ly humbled Paul, he &s;endeth him to Ananias, Acts ix. 10. and when he had &s;ent an angel to Cornelius, it is but to bid him &s;end for Peter, who mu&s;t tell him what he is to believe and do.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>BETAKE your&s;elves to God in a cour&s;e of earne&s;t con&s;tant prayer. Confe&s;s and lament your former lives, and beg his grace to illumi|nate and convert you. Be&s;eech him to pardon what is pa&s;t, and to give you his &s;pirit, and

<P>PRESENTLY give over your known and wil|ful &s;ins. Make a &s;tand, and go that way no further. Be drunk no more, but avoid the very occa&s;ion of it.

Cur&s;e, and &s;wear, and rail no more, and if you have wrong|ed any, re&s;tore as Zaccheus did; if you will com|mit again your old &s;ius, what ble&s;&s;ing can you ex|pect on the means for conver&s;ion?</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENTLY, if po&s;&s;ible, change your com|pany, if it hath hitherto been bad; not by for&s;aking your nece&s;&s;ary relations, but your unnece&s;&s;ary &s;inful companions, and join your|&s;elves with tho&s;e that fear the Lord, and enquire of them the way to heaven, Acts ix. 19.26. P&s;al. xv. 4.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>DELIVER up your&s;elves to the Lord Je&s;us as the phy&s;ician of your &s;ouls, that he may par|don you by his blood, and &s;anctify you by his &s;pirit, by his word and mini&s;ters, by in&s;truments of the &s;pirit. He is the way, the truth and the life; there is no coming to the Father but by him.
<PB N="137" REF="028243_0069_0FD74711332F2A28">John xiv. 1. Nor is there any name under hea|ven, by which you can be &s;aved. Acts iv. 12. Study therefore his per&s;on and natures, and what he hath done for you, and what he is to do for you, and what he will be, and how he is fitted to the full &s;upply of all your nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IF you mean indeed to turn and live, do it &s;pee|dily without delay. If you be not willing to turn to day, you be not willing to do it at all. Re|member you are all this while in your blood, under the guilt of many thou&s;and &s;ins and under God's wrath, and you &s;tand at the very brink of hell; there is but a &s;tep between you and death. And this is not a ca&s;e for a man that is well in his wits to be quiet in. Up therefore pre&s;ently, and fly as for your lives, as you would be gone out of your hou&s;e if it were all on fire over your head. O, if you did but know what continual danger you live in, and what daily un&s;peakable lo&s;s you do &s;u&s;tain, and what &s;afer and &s;weeter life you might live, you would not &s;tand trifling, but pre&s;ently turn. Multitudes mi&s;carry that wilfully delay when they are convinced that it mu&s;t be done. Your lives are &s;hort and uncertain; and what a ca&s;e are you in, if you die before you thorough|ly turn! You have &s;taid too long already, and wronged God too long. Sin getteth &s;trength and rooting while you delay. Your conver&s;ion will grow more hard and doubtful. You have much to do, and therefore put not off to the la&s;t, le&s;t

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION IX.</HEAD>
<P>IF you will turn and live, do it unre&s;ervedly, ab&s;olutely, and univer&s;ally. Think not to capi|tulate with Chri&s;t, and divide your heart betwixt him and the world; and to part with &s;ome &s;ins, and keep the re&s;t; and to let go that which your fle&s;h can &s;pare. This is but &s;elf deluding; you mu&s;t in heart and re&s;olution for&s;ake all that you have, or el&s;e you cannot be his di&s;ciples. Luke xiv. 26.33. If you will not take God and Hea|ven for your portion, and lay all below at the feet of Chri&s;t, but you mu&s;t needs al&s;o have your good things here, and have an earthly portion, and God and glory is not enough for you; it is vain to dream of &s;alvation on the&s;e terms: For it will not be. If you &s;eem never &s;o religious, if yet it be but a carnal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the fle&s;h's pro&s;perity, or plea&s;ure, or &s;afety, be &s;till except|ed in your devoutedne&s;s to God; this is as certain a way to death as open profanene&s;s, though it be more plau&s;ible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>DIRECTION X.</HEAD>
<P>IF you will turn and live, do it re&s;olvedly, and &s;tand not &s;till deliberating, as if it were a doubt|ful ca&s;e. Stand not wavering, as if you were yet uncertain whether God or the fle&s;h be the better ma&s;ter, or whether heaven and hell be the better end, or whether &s;in or holine&s;s be the better way.
<PB N="139" REF="028243_0070_0FD7471322CF0E78">But away with your former lu&s;ts, and pre&s;ently, habitually, fixedly re&s;olve: Be not one day of one mind, and the next of another, but be at a point with all the world, and re&s;olvedly give up your&s;elves and all that you have to God. Now while you are reading or hearing this, re&s;olve; be|fore you &s;leep another night, re&s;olve; be|fore you &s;tir from the place, re&s;olve; before Sa|tan hath time to take you off, re&s;olve. You ne|ver turn indeed till you do re&s;olve, and that with a firm and unchangeable re&s;olution.</P>
<P>So much for the directions.</P>
<P>AND now I have done my part in this work, that you may turn to the call of God and live. What will become of it, I cannot tell. I have ca&s;t the &s;eed at God's command; but it is not in my power to give the increa&s;e. I cannot go any further with my me&s;&s;age; I cannot bring it to your heart, nor make it work; I can|not do your parts for you, to entertain it and con|&s;ider it; nor I cannot do God's part by opening your hearts to cau&s;e you to entertain it; nor can I &s;hew you heaven or hell to your eye &s;ight, nor give you new and tender hearts. If I knew what more to do for your conver&s;ion, I hope I &s;hould do it.</P>
<P>But O thou that art the gracious Father of Spi|rits, thou ha&s;t &s;worn thou delighte&s;t not in the death of the wicked, but rather that they would turn and live; deny not thy ble&s;&s;ings to the&s;e pro|&s;ua&s;ions and directions, and &s;uffer not thine ene|mies to triumph in thy &s;ight, and the great de|ciever of &s;ouls to prevail again&s;t thy Son, thy Spi|rit, and thy Word.

Awaken the &s;ecure, re&s;olve the unre&s;olved, confirm the wavering, and let the eyes of &s;inners that read the&s;e lines, be next employed in weeping over their &s;ins, and bring them to them&s;elves, and to thy Son, before their &s;ins have brought them to perdition.

<BIBL><HI>Extract from the Critical Review, April</HI> 1791, <HI>p.</HI> 468.</BIBL>
<P><Q>It may be a Tale of Truth, for it is not unnatu|ral, and it is a tale of real di&s;tre&s;s Charlotte by the artifice of a teacher, recommended to a &s;chool, from humanity rather than a conviction of her in|tegrity, or the regularity of her former conduct, is enticed from her governe&s;s, and accompanies a young officer to America. The marriage ceremo|ny, if not forgotten, is po&s;tponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the incon&s;tancy of her lover, and the treachery of his friend. The &s;ituations are artle&s;s and affecting, the de&s;criptions natural and pathetic; we &s;hould feel for Charlotte, if &s;uch a per&s;on ever exi&s;ted, who for one error, &s;carcely perhaps de&s;erved &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment. If it is a &s;iction, poetic ju&s;tice is not, we think, properly di&s;tributed.</Q> Price 75 cents.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"The editor of this publication hopes from the e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation of the &s;everal tracts of which it is compo&s;ed, that it will be found a more complete &s;y&s;tem for the in&s;truction of the female world, than perhaps any other extant.</P>
<P>"A volume under the pre&s;ent title was lately pub|li&s;hed in England and Ireland, and had a mo&s;t rapid &s;ale, having been purcha&s;ed by almo&s;t every lady of ta&s;te in tho&s;e kingdoms. To this volume, the American editor has added Mi&s;s More's e&s;&s;ays; Mrs. Chapone's letter on the government of the temper; and Swift's letter to a lady newly married. The&s;e have con&s;iderably enhanced its value; and he doubts not, the ladies on this &s;ide the Atlantic, will be as generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their advantage, as tho&s;e in England and Ireland have been."</P>

<P>By Mrs. Row&s;on, author of Charlotte, &amp;c. Price 87&frac12; cents</P>
<P>"Mrs Row&s;on looked up to Stern as the object of her imitation, but &s;he has really rivalled one of her own &s;ex, the author of the Rambles of Frankly. The work is wholly of that kind, and in no re&s;pect inferior to it, except in having adopted a ring, by which the Inqui&s;itor is rendered invi&s;ible. The &s;lave in the be|ginning of the &s;econd volume, is written in the be&s;t manner of Stern. There are many pathetic traits, which &s;peak to the heart, and are drawn from nature. They are extremely affecting, when we forget the ring. Though the Inqui&s;itor, like the Rambles of Fankly, con&s;i&s;ts of independent chapters; yet &s;ome connection is kept up through the whole; and, in that re&s;pect, as well as in pathos, this work may be &s;aid to exceed its competitor."</P>

<P>Two Volumes, one dollar and three quarters.</P>
<P>"On the various and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects with which moral &s;cience and belles lettres abound, Dr. Beattie has treated in a &s;ummary, but plea&s;ing and compre|hen&s;ive manner. The &s;tudent will &s;eldom find any thing of importance left untouched; and whatever be the &s;ubject, it is illu&s;trated and enforced with Dr. Beattie's u&s;ual eloquence and good &s;en&s;e. No writer is better calculated to re&s;i&s;t the &s;ophi&s;try of modern philo&s;ophy; and the deductions which he forms on &s;ubjects of morals, critici&s;m and ta&s;te, are generally &s;uch as the under&s;tanding acquie&s;ces in without &s;u&s;|picion, and almo&s;t without an effort. The chief beau|ties of his &s;tyle are freedom and per&s;picuity: and the prominent features of his matter are, &s;ound morals, rational religion, and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>"Our author di&s;cu&s;&s;es with his u&s;ual ability, the more important duties we owe the Deity, our fellow creatures, and our&s;elves.</P>
<P>"In part the &s;econd will be found &s;ome admirable remarks again&s;t &s;lavery; a &s;ubject on which Dr. Beat|tie expatiates with a warmth of benevolence that does him great honour.</P>
<P>"Part IV compri&s;es rhetoric al&s;o, as forming a con&s;iderable part of logic, or the &s;cience of per&s;ua|&s;ion. On the various, but trite &s;ubjects that fall un|der Dr. Beattie's di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in this general divi&s;ion of his work, we find the &s;ame ju&s;t ta&s;te, accurate di&s;tinc|tion, and &s;olid judgment, that characteri&s;e him as a writer. Our extracts have already &s;welled this article beyond the u&s;ual limits; we mu&s;t be content therefore with recommending the Elements of Moral Science to young &s;tudents in particular, and the public in ge|neral, as a very u&s;eful, elegant, and judicious compen|dium of the various &s;ubjects which it contains."</P>
