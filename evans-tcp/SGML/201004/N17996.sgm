<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE &s;eparation of the di&s;trict of Maine from the pre&s;ent government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was a &s;ubject, which, from the year 1785 to the year 1788, occupied much of the publick attention. A bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much import|ance, and pregnant with &s;o many advanta|ges to that part of the country which we inhabit, ought not to &s;ink into oblivion. During the time comprehended in the abovementioned periods, it went through a fair and general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides the candid examination of it in the public new&s;papers, the Portland Convention, con&s;i&s;t|ing of delegates from a re&s;pectable number of towns in the di&s;trict, gave the &s;ubject its due con&s;ideration. A very large majority of that Convention, after a lengthy and de|liberate enquiry into the &s;tate of the di&s;trict, and its rela|tive &s;ituation with the Commmonwealth at large, deemed it expedient and nece&s;&s;ary for us to become a &s;eparate gov|ernment. To carry this determination into effect, they cho&s;e a commitee to draft and prefer to the General Court, a dutiful and re&s;pectful Addre&s;s, &s;tating their wi&s;hes to be di&s;membered from the we&s;tern part of the Commonwealth, their rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to be thus di&s;membered, and re|que&s;ting their concurrence therein. This addre&s;s would undoubtedly have produced a final deci&s;ion of the Legi&s;|lature
<PB N="6" REF="023313_0004_0FBF02A8295B99C8">
upon the que&s;tion, had not the very particular and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the government, at the time it was pre&s;ented, ab&s;orbed every other publick con&s;ideration.&mdash; This time happenned to be immediately &s;ub&s;equent to the late unhappy in&s;urrections. While the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the government continued, the attention of the Legi&s;lature could not with propriety have been called to the &s;ubject; and thus the whole bu&s;ine&s;s fell a&s;leep, and remained un+attended to, and almo&s;t unthought of, till the &s;e&s;&s;ion the General Court held in Jannuary, 1791.</P>
<P>So far as the &s;entiments of the people could be collect|ed, by repeatedly conver&s;ing with the principal men in mo&s;t of the populous towns in the di&s;trict, or by their delegates to the Portland Convention, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that, in the year 1787, a government in this territory would have been agreeable to a majority of its inhabitants. But many rea&s;ons which did not then exi&s;t, now operate to render &s;uch an event extremely de&s;irable. The adoption, and firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the United States, is one of the fir&s;t. The &s;everal objects of legi&s;lation which are the mo&s;t difficult to manage, are, by that con|&s;titution, taken out of the hands of the &s;tate governments; and referred to the Legi&s;lature of the Union. This mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a great relief to tho&s;e, who&s;e lot it may be to admini&s;ter a government, without the nece&s;&s;ary experi|ence. The intricate and important bu&s;ine&s;s of finance, lay|ing and collecting duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es, regulating commerce with foreign nations and the &s;everal States, de|claring war, rai&s;ing armies and navies, and making pro|vi&s;ion for their &s;upport, and rules for their government, together with other concerns of &s;uch a nature, are tru&s;ts which will not hereafter devolve upon tho&s;e who are called to admini&s;ter the State governments.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="023313_0005_0FBF02ABD8E25C80">To this I might add many others of great weight and im|portance, to convince &s;uch as were formerly in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that the pre&s;ent time affords the golden oppor|tunity to revive the important work of e&s;tabli&s;hing a gov|ernment in the di&s;trict of Maine. But the&s;e will, with greater propriety, come under con&s;ideration hereafter.</P>
<P>In order to con&s;ider this &s;ubject clearly, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To enumerate, and enlarge upon, the advantages which will accrue to the citizens of this di&s;trict, by a &s;epa|ration from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and an admi&s;&s;ion into the Union.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To mention, and endeavour to obviate, the ob|jections which have been rai&s;ed a in&s;t &s;uch a mea&s;ure.&mdash; And,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> To make it appear, that no time ought to be lo&s;t, in applying to the Legi&s;latures of the Commonwealth, and of the Union, for their con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1">I. I will endeavour to enumerate the advantages to be gained by the Di&s;trict;&mdash;And I &s;hall not here confine my|&s;elf merely to tho&s;e benefits and advantages, which will immediately and &s;en&s;ibly re&s;ult from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the government; as all the rea&s;ons (from whatever &s;ource they may be drawn) in favour of, and all the inconvenien|ces which would probably be remedied by &s;uch a mea&s;ure, may with propriety be here con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious rea&s;on, and indeed that from which mo&s;t of the others mu&s;t be derived, is <HI>our detached and already di&s;membered &s;ituation from the other parts of the Common|wealth.</HI> According to the pre&s;ent territorial &s;ituation of
<PB N="8" REF="023313_0006_0FBF02AE69D77CA0">
Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Newhamp&s;hire, it &s;eems to be thwarting the de&s;igns of nature, for the di&s;trict of Maine to continue any longer connected with another government, than what mere nece&s;&s;ity dictates. We inhabit an exten&s;ive tract of country, which, by the intervention of the &s;tate of New|hamp&s;hire, is divided and &s;eparated from every part of the Commonwealth, with which we are in other re&s;pects con|nected. There is therefore the &s;ame rea&s;on for our being attached to the government of Newyork or Southcarolina, as to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, except that it does not operate in an equal degree; that is, the di&s;tance to the &s;eat of government, for in&s;tance, would in that ca&s;e be greater, and of cour&s;e the inconveniences of &s;uch a connection greater. But we are now at a <HI>great</HI> di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government&mdash; we are now as totally &s;eparated from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, with re&s;pect to local &s;ituation, as we are from Newyork or South|carolina&mdash;and we are now embarra&s;&s;ed with many of the &s;ame troubles and inconveniences that we &s;hould be, were our &s;eat of government in either of the la&s;t mentioned States.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be entitled to <HI>&s;end two Senators to the Federal Legi&s;lature,</HI> when we become a di&s;tinct member of the Un|ion. This is one of the advantages that we may realize, in con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the United States, which provides, that "the Senate &s;hall be compo&s;ed of two Senators from each State, cho&s;en by the legi&s;lature thereof." The happy effects to be derived from the appointment of two per&s;ons to &s;o important a &s;tation, are, the inducements which it will afford (to tho&s;e of our fellow citizens who&s;e education and characters allow them the pro&s;pect of being elected to fill it) to qualify them&s;elves by gaining the nece&s;&s;ary information, and to conduct them|&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to enjoy the confidence and ap|probation
<PB N="9" REF="023313_0007_0FBF02AFAE3D0D28">
of the wi&s;e and good part of the community&mdash; the political knowledge which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily gain by paying attention to, and taking a part in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Congre&s;s&mdash;the propagating of that knowledge among their fellow citizens at home&mdash;the circulation of the money which their compen&s;ations will entitle them to receive&mdash;and la&s;t|ly, their returning from their elevated &s;tations to mix, con|ver&s;e with, and come down to the level of their ma&s;ters the people.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, which will be wholly confined to the Di&s;trict, there are others which the Commonwealth at large, and the northern States in general, will enjoy, by this addition of two members to the Federal Senate. Ev|ery per&s;on who is acquainted with the commerce, inhabi|tants, and mode of living in the various parts of the conti|nent, mu&s;t acknowledge, that there is a great diver&s;ity of intere&s;t between the northern and &s;outhern States. The journals of Congre&s;s, or &s;uch of their proceedings as have been made publick in the new&s;papers, for the la&s;t two years, &s;ufficiently evidence the truth of this fact. But were it not for the&s;e, it is well known that the commercial intere&s;ts of the two extremes of the continent are almo&s;t in direct op|po&s;ition to each other; and that the mode of education, manners, and habits of life, are evidently different at the &s;outhward, from what they are in the Newengland States. Oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and oppo&s;ite modes of life, very natural|ly create oppo&s;ite &s;entiments. Hence it is, that in mo&s;t of the deci&s;ions of Congre&s;s, upon que&s;tions which affect the general intere&s;t of the United States, we find the &s;outhern gentlemen upon one &s;ide, &amp; tho&s;e from the north|ward upon the other. The publick bu&s;ine&s;s is hereby much retarded; and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the influence and pow|er of the &s;outhern members, have produced laws and de|ci&s;ions,
<PB N="10" REF="023313_0008_0FBF02B12F1F3798">
which have an injurious operation upon us.&mdash; Some of the con&s;equences of the&s;e laws now are, that we cannot obtain &s;ome of the mo&s;t common nece&s;&s;aries of life, without paying a high duty upon them.</P>
<P>The fi&s;heries, tho&s;e important and valuable &s;ources of livelihood and wealth to &s;ome of our be&s;t citizens, are now on the decline; and the carrying trade by the American &s;hipping, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that it mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be giv|en up, unle&s;s &s;ome regulations in its favour are &s;peedily a|dopted. One of the&s;e regulations mu&s;t be, an additional tonnage upon foreign &s;hipping, to prevent their becoming carriers of the &s;outhern produce. But &s;uch is the partiali|ty of the merchants of the &s;outhern States, in favour of &s;hipping owned and navigated by Europeans, that their re|pre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s will never con&s;ent to &s;uch a ton|nage, until they are compelled to it by a majority of votes.</P>
<P>The&s;e are evils of the fir&s;t magnitude. The be&s;t and mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of this Commonwealth in particu|lar, as well as of the northern States at large, are mate|rially affected by them. What remedy &s;hall we apply? Perhaps it is out of our power, at this time, to provide one that is perfectly adequate; but it is, neverthele&s;s, our duty to effect all that we po&s;&s;ibly can for this purpo&s;e. We ought to become a &s;eparate government; and thereby give to the northern intere&s;t an addition of two Senators in the Fede|ral Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Having enlarged upon the advantages of an additional number of Federal Senators, I will now mention one or two other rea&s;ons which ought to induce us to wi&s;h for a government of our own, and which are al&s;o of a general nature.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="023313_0009_0FBF02B3A6F7C0F8">The con&s;titution of the United States is &s;o happily con|&s;tructed, that &s;o long as it is faithfully admini&s;tered, the powers which it gives to Congre&s;s, and tho&s;e retained by the &s;everal States, will be kept clearly di&s;tinct, and be pro|perly exerci&s;ed by each of them re&s;pectively. But when|ever it is <HI>unfaithfully</HI> admini&s;tered, Congre&s;s may u&s;urp powers which they have no con&s;titutional right to exerci&s;e; and in the cour&s;e of time, bring about <HI>a con&s;olidation of the States.</HI> This is an event which we have no rea&s;on to believe will be effected very &s;uddenly&mdash;perhaps not in the pre&s;ent age. But if it &s;hould happen at all, it is &s;uch an event as every friend to the pro&s;perity of his country mu&s;t depre|cate more than all the catalogue of political mi&s;chiefs.&mdash; The be&s;t &s;ecurity that we have again&s;t it, is that laudable jealou&s;y which the Legi&s;latures of the &s;everal States will con&s;tantly exerci&s;e over the admini&s;tration of the general government. This jealou&s;y will operate as a check upon Congre&s;s. For &s;hould they attempt a u&s;urpation of any powers not expre&s;sly delegated to them by the con&s;titution, the State Legi&s;latures will immediately con&s;ider &s;uch an at|tempt as an encroachment upon their rights; upon this principle, that whatever powers are not expre&s;sly delegat|ed to Congre&s;s, are impliedly re&s;erved to the people. If the&s;e ob&s;ervations are founded on the principles of the Fede|ral Union, it will nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the more of the&s;e checks there are, the greater will be the &s;afety in the ad|mini&s;tration of the government, both of the United States, and the individual States. An additional Legi&s;lature in the Di&s;trict of Maine, will be an additional check upon the pow|er of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>This argument ought to have its due weight in the &s;cale. I profe&s;s to be as free as any man from groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies of the admini&s;tration of the Federal Government. But it
<PB N="12" REF="023313_0010_0FBF02B896CE1E98">
ought to be con&s;idered, that the con&s;titution of the United States is to be tran&s;mitted to, and tru&s;ted in, the hands of po&s;terity; &mdash;that we can neither fore&s;ee, or prevent, any changes in the principles or morals of mankind, which the lap&s;e of one or two centuries may introduce, and which may be very unfriendly to the liberties and happine&s;s of future generations.</P>
<P>Another important argument in favour of a di&s;member|ment of the di&s;trict, is, <HI>that we &s;hall have the government ad|mini&s;tered in the mid&s;t of the people.</HI> The advantages which will flow from a government thus admini&s;tered are very numerous, as every per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, who is the lea&s;t acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s. The people at large will not then be &s;o far removed from the &s;ources of political in|formation, as they are at pre&s;ent. It is of great impor|tance, that they &s;hould be as well informed of the mea&s;ures which their Legi&s;lators are pur&s;uing, as their &s;ituation will admit. They will then be able to form a ju&s;t opinion of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and of tho&s;e who pur&s;ue them. Informa|tion of this kind will be the means of preventing errone|ous and fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the conduct of the Legi&s;|&s;lature. This is an evil which too much care cannot be taken to prevent. It creates a groundle&s;s di&s;affection be|tween the people and their rulers, which generally pro|duces the wor&s;t mi&s;chiefs to &s;ociety.&mdash;De&s;igning men, who happen to be di&s;affected towards the Government, may a|vail them&s;elves of the ignorance which people far remov|ed from the &s;eat of governmental information are nece&s;&s;ari|ly involved in; and by impo&s;ing upon their credulity, in|duce them to believe that the be&s;t of men are become the wor&s;t of tyrants. Fal&s;e repre&s;entations of this kind, by men of this character, were undoubtedly a principal cau&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="023313_0011_0FBF02BCBA984A38">
of the late civil di&s;cords, which terminated in nothing &s;hort of high trea&s;on and rebellion.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e advantages, the intere&s;t of every part of the Di&s;trict is &s;o preci&s;ely the &s;ame, that the laws of the new government might be con&s;tructed in &s;uch a manner, as to apply directly to the local &s;ituation, climate, habits and bu&s;ine&s;s of every part of the territory. It cannot be &s;aid that this is the ca&s;e with the pre&s;ent laws of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, as they re&s;pect us. In many in&s;tances their laws have an injurious operation upon us; but admitting that was not the ca&s;e, it is neverthele&s;s true, that many new ones might be in&s;tituted more congenial to the &s;tate of the coun|try, than any that ever have been, or ever will be enacted by that government, until the ea&s;tern intere&s;t predomi|nates over the we&s;tern. Whether it will be prudent for us to wait the arrival of that period before we attempt to do our&s;elves ju&s;tice, I leave to the determination of tho&s;e who have con&s;idered the &s;ubject. But in private life we gene|rally &s;uppo&s;e, that when a man's bu&s;ine&s;s lies at a di&s;tance from him, he cannot &s;uperintend it with that care and at|tention which is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent its falling into a de|ranged and relaxed &s;ituation.&mdash;It is the &s;ame with the pre|&s;ent government. We are con&s;idered as the excre&s;ence of the family; and their language is, "We have enough to do in taking care of the Commonwealth in <HI>general;</HI> and if we make laws adapted particularly to the Di&s;trict of Maine, we mu&s;t do the &s;ame for every county in the State."&mdash; This I confe&s;s is the language of truth. Let us then relieve them from &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing an embarra&s;&s;ment, and make laws for our&s;elves. For, being at pre&s;ent but a minor part of the Commonwealth, whenever a law is propo&s;ed to be en|acted, which would be advantageous to the Commonwealth in general, but adver&s;e to the intere&s;t of this part of it in
<PB N="14" REF="023313_0012_0FBF02BDF018F918">
particular, it will not only be the intere&s;t, but the duty of the General Court to pa&s;s it. It will al&s;o be the duty of our own members to promote it, although it &s;hould be <HI>a|gain&s;t their intere&s;t.</HI> For every one of them is under the &s;acred obligations of an oath, to di&s;charge the duties of his appointment impartially, and according to his be&s;t &s;kill and judgment. They cannot, therefore, without a violation of their oaths, be governed by their own intere&s;t, or the intere&s;t of tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent, when it comes in competition with that of the majority.&mdash;Thus it ap|pears, that in all the in&s;tances of the nature of tho&s;e which I dwell upon, the duty of the General Court will oblige them to enact &s;uch laws as may have a cruel operation up|on us, and that <HI>our own members will be under oath to oppre&s;s us.</HI></P>
<P>We may rationally indulge a hope, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Legi&s;lative Body in the Di&s;trict <HI>will be the means of changing for the better, the pre&s;ent melancholly &s;tate of religion and learning.</HI>&mdash;It does not come within the compa&s;s of my pre&s;ent undertaking to point out the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upport|ing the in&s;titutions of the former, or the benefits that may be derived from a laudable u&s;e of the latter of the&s;e orna|ments and ble&s;&s;ings of human life. But I cannot forbear to add, that without them, mankind would &s;oon degene|rate into &s;avage ferocity; and &s;ociety, in&s;tead of pre&s;ent|ing us with the &s;cenes of delightful enjoyment, would ex|hibit the &s;ad, uncomely picture of vicious and capricious folly. None, therefore, but the abandoned &amp; profligate will deny, that the benefits of a good government greatly depend upon the in&s;tructions and examples of a learned and liberal clergy; and none but the deba&s;ed and degenerate will a&s;&s;ert, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of regular and well ordered &s;chools of learning, will not tend equally to promote the true in|tere&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="023313_0013_0FBF02BF6AB02190">
of an enlightened people. The di&s;advantages and di&s;|orders which many parts of the Di&s;trict are obliged con|&s;tantly to combat, and which tho&s;e in&s;tructions which are gained from &s;chools, and from the pulpit, would undoubt|edly tend to remove, mu&s;t afford real anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s to every heart that wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of mankind. But it would afford greater anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s to &s;uch a heart, if the real &s;tate of the di&s;trict in this re&s;pect were truly de&s;cribed. I will not undertake to per|form the painful ta&s;k. It is enough for me to &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent laws of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts are inadequate to the complete removal of the&s;e evils.</P>
<P>In the old inhabited parts of the Commonwealth, the people have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to provide for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters &amp; &s;choolma&s;ters, that mere habit would be &s;ufficient to induce them to continue in the laudable practice. But in a new country, where the inhabitants are, for a number of years, obliged to encounter every hard|&s;hip, and u&s;e every exertion for the &s;upport of their fami|lies, they frequently regret the want, but &s;eldom provide for the means of publick wor&s;hip and private in&s;truction. Thus the &s;ame habit which in an ancient &s;ettlement ope|rates in favour of &s;uch a provi&s;ion, in a new one has a con|trary tendency. The force of this habit often tends to per&s;uade people, that they cannot afford the means for education of their children, when they might do it with|out inconvenience to them&s;elves or families.</P>
<P>The neglect with which the laws for the regulations of &s;chools are treated, by many of the towns in this part of the country, &s;eems to meet with a general indulgence I will not undertake to enumerate tho&s;e, which for a long time have been, and &s;till continue in this neglect. But let
<PB N="16" REF="023313_0014_0FBF02C0E92D1788">
any man who is acquainted with the country, e&s;pecially the three ea&s;termo&s;t counties, call to his mind the number of towns which ought by law to have been provided with mini&s;ters and &s;choolma&s;ters for the la&s;t ten years; and then let him inquire how many of them have been puni&s;hed for their neglect of being thus provided, in the cour&s;e of that time. The re&s;ult of that enquiry will afford full proof, that very little notice has been taken of the laws; and al&s;o, that unle&s;s &s;ome amendments in them are introduced, the benefits which they were de&s;igned to di&s;pen&s;e will never be enjoyed by the people in the ea&s;tern country. But the&s;e amendments cannot be obtained until the governmental connection with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is di&s;&s;olved. In the we&s;tern parts of the Commonwealth, the in&s;titutions of religion and learning, are generally attended to, and therefore, as to the people there, the laws for their &s;upport have no need of amendments. But mo&s;t unfortunately for us, it is oth|erwi&s;e here; and our duty as men, as citizens and as chri&s;|tians, calls aloud upon us to introduce a legi&s;lature into the very center of the mi&s;chief, in order the more effectually to aboli&s;h it.</P>
<P>Another very important advantage that we &s;hall enjoy by a &s;eparation from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, will be <HI>the &s;itting of a Supreme Judicial Court twice a year in &s;ome, and once at lea&s;t in all the counties in the di&s;trict.</HI> At pre&s;ent we are indulged with but one term of that Court annually in each of the counties of York, Cumberland and Lincoln; and it is now holden in Lincoln but once a year for that, and the coun|ties of Hancock and Wa&s;hington. The extent of the Commonwealth, and the quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s they are call|ed upon to tran&s;act, is &s;o great, that it is impracticable to effect a more favourable arrangement in that department.
<PB N="17" REF="023313_0015_0FBF02C76F3B2408">
All the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Di&s;trict, which a Supreme Court will, for &s;ome years to come be called to tran&s;act, will not probably require more than eight weeks in each year, ex|clu&s;ive of the time they are traveling. A fortnight in each of the counties wherein the Supreme Court is at pre&s;ent holden, would be amply &s;ufficient for the whole of their bu&s;ine&s;s. A Supreme Court, therefore, in ca&s;e of a &s;epa|ration, might be conveniently holden twice a year in the counties of York Cumberland and Lincoln, and once (or oftener if nece&s;&s;ary) in tho&s;e of Hancock and Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>The relief which this arrangement would afford to the people would be very great. For in each of the two we&s;|tern counties there is but one week allowed for the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s. The con&s;equence is, that very often near one half of it is left unfini&s;hed, for want of time. Parties and their witne&s;&s;es, with all the horrors of poverty in their appearance, are obliged to attend the Court the whole of the week, and at the end of it, return to their families with their bu&s;ine&s;s undone, di&s;appointed, di&s;&s;atisfied and impoveri&s;hed. Their complaints are loud and affecting, and of &s;uch a nature that they cannot be removed. But, it is of great con&s;equence to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the citizens, that their wrongs &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed without delay; and we cannot provide for them a greater ble&s;&s;ing than the &s;peedy and prompt admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>An additional number of terms of the Supreme Judicial Court would al&s;o relieve the people from a very con&s;ider|able expen&s;e, which is now annually incurred in the &s;up|port of criminals committed for trial. This is an evil which is daily increa&s;ing. It is not an unu&s;ual thing, for per&s;ons to be confined in the jails, at the publick expen&s;e, for nine or ten months together, waiting for nothing but the re|turn

<P><PB N="19" REF="023313_0017_0FBF02CAAD49A890">The advantages of a Supreme Judicial Court would be peculiarly great in the counties of Hancock and Wa&s;hing|ton.

<P>An argument of great weight in favour of a Separate Government, is, <HI>the inequality with which the publick taxes operate upon us.</HI> &mdash;Taxes apportioned according to a gene|ral valuation, mu&s;t always have, in &s;ome degree, an une|qual operation, where the article taxed is of greater value in one part of the Commonwealth than in another. A farmer in this part of the country is taxed as much for
<PB N="20" REF="023313_0018_0FBF02CC293652D0">
the &s;ame quantity of &s;tock, and the &s;ame number of acres of land, as a farmer is in the vicinity of Bo&s;ton. This is evi|dently unju&s;t; becau&s;e a cow in that vicinity is of double the value of one in this; and ten acres of land may be man|aged there in &s;uch a manner as to produce more profit to the owner, than a hundred acres are made to yield in any part of the ea&s;tern country. In addition to this, the length and &s;everity of our winters are &s;uch as to require, at lea&s;t, one fourth part more of forage to &s;upport our &s;tock, than is required for that purpo&s;e at the we&s;tward. We are al|&s;o &s;ubject to the lo&s;s of our crops by untimely fro&s;ts and wild bea&s;ts, which are by no means &s;o de&s;tructive in the &s;outhern and we&s;tern counties as they are here.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties, ari&s;ing from &s;uch &s;ources as, in our pre|&s;ent political &s;ituation, nothing but the hand of Omnipo|tence can remove, nece&s;&s;arily and greatly decrea&s;e the value of our lands and &s;tock, and reduce them far below the general value of the &s;ame property el&s;ewhere. For this injury there can be no radical cure but a &s;y&s;tem of revenue founded upon a valuation of the property of this di&s;trict in particular: And if the con&s;equences of it were thoroughly traced, it would be found that the taxes which we annual|ly pay more than our ju&s;t and equitabe proportion, would go far towards the &s;upport of a government of our own.</P>
<P>There are in the di&s;trict of Maine upwards of <HI>thirty unin|corporated plantations,</HI> the inhabitants of which do not at pre&s;ent enjoy their full proportion of the public privileges. This is an argument in favour of a new government, which ought to have its due weight. By putting them in a bet|ter &s;ituation in this re&s;pect, we &s;hall derive additional &s;up|port and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them in the government, By in|corporating them with town privileges, we &s;hould reap the
<PB N="21" REF="023313_0019_0FBF02D39581FF28">
advantages of an increa&s;ed repre&s;entation. Members of the general court, coming from the interior parts of the coun|try where mo&s;t of the&s;e plantations are &s;ituated, would bring with them credible accounts of the wants and griev|ances of infant and indigent &s;ettlements, which always re|quire the fo&s;tering hand of government for their encour|agement and protection. When they are called upon to bear their proportion of the public burthens, their repre|&s;entatives will be in&s;trumental in quieting the complaints which generally follow the&s;e demands, by removing their apprehen&s;ions that their rulers are &s;pending their money un|nece&s;&s;arily; and by explaining to them the real &s;tate and management of the publick concerns. This will tend to e&s;tabli&s;h in their minds that confidence in publick men, and their mea&s;ures, without which the harmony, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be cultivated between them and the people, will be in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>We need not apprehend, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> any danger from making our Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives too unwieldly, by the increa&s;e of its number. The bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation is im|portant, and ought not to be tran&s;acted in a hurry. The greate&s;t inconvenience ari&s;ing from a numerous repre&s;enta|tion, is, that it retards the publick bu&s;ine&s;s. But much more inju&s;tice may be done to the publick, in running through the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a mea&s;ure in one day; and, by not thoroughly dige&s;ting it, determining <HI>wrong;</HI> than, by &s;pending a week upon it, and finally determining <HI>right.</HI>&mdash; I am &s;en&s;ible that it is a favourite &s;entiment with many, that a &s;mall repre&s;entation is preferable to a large one; becau&s;e it can di&s;patch the publick bu&s;ine&s;s with greater &s;peed. In &s;ome re&s;pects this &s;entiment is ju&s;t; in others it is not &s;o.

<P><PB N="22" REF="023313_0020_0FBF02D5F0EF2150">It is highly probable, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Govern|ment in this Di&s;trict will <HI>induce men of learning and educa|tion to &s;ettle in it.</HI> It will be happy for us, if, by this means, we can add to the number of our men of literature. Per|&s;ons of this character, who happen to be a little tinctured with ambition, will probably make the fir&s;t attempt They will con&s;ider that the new State mu&s;t have its officers, civil, military and judicial.

They will imagine a young Government in a new country, to be the proper theatre for the commencement of their career; and although they may be deceived in their expectations, the country may gain a number of re&s;pectable citizens.</P>
<P>Immigrations of other valuable citizens will probably be increa&s;ed by a new Government. Should this be the ca&s;e, the intere&s;t of, and improvements in, hu&s;bandry will be ad|vanced, the country opened, and many of the hard&s;hips, which we now encounter from climate and local &s;ituation, alleviated. Good policy will dictate the enacting of laws for the encouragement of agriculture; for inviting &s;tran|gers to &s;ettle upon governmental lands, free from taxes for a number of years;&mdash;and for making other regulations of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>A great inconvenience which we labour under in having <HI>all our money that is rai&s;ed and expended for the &s;upport of Gov|ernment, carried out of the Di&s;trict,</HI> will be remedied by a &s;ep|aration from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. All the money which we now pay towards the &s;upport of government, and the di&s;charge of its debts, is carried to the &s;eat of government, there de|po&s;ited, and there expended. With this inconvenience may be al&s;o ranked others of a &s;imilar nature. While the &s;eat of government remains at Bo&s;ton, we are nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="23" REF="023313_0021_0FBF02D78D901F48">
called to that capital to tran&s;act all our public bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; Nothing can be done at the offices of the Secretary, Trea|&s;urer, Commi&s;&s;ary General, Clerk of the Supreme Court, &amp;c. &amp;c. without traveling, at a great expen&s;e, from &s;ixty to four hundred miles. It is true opportunities by water frequently happen, and in the mo&s;t ea&s;terly parts of the Di&s;trict, are generally embraced; but their uncertainty oft|en occa&s;ions delays and di&s;appointments, to the great inju|ry of the people.</P>
<P>If the money, which is nece&s;&s;arily carried out of the country by the&s;e means, could be retained in circulation at home, it would contribute towards the removal of &s;ome of the many complaints ari&s;ing from the &s;carcity of ca&s;h. All the money &s;ent out of the Di&s;trict in this manner, is the &s;ame to us as if it were &s;ent out of the world. Our policy ought therefore to be &s;uch as will contribute to keep it a|mong our&s;elves. In the back and recently &s;ettled parts of the country, ca&s;h is &s;carcely known as a medium of trade. When the people are called upon for their taxes, it fre|quently happens that they are obliged to make great &s;acri|fices of their property in order to obtain ca&s;h; and when the trouble of procuring it at any rate, is taken into con&s;id|eration, humanity requires that we &s;hould exert our&s;elves for their relief.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration, which ought to come in|to the li&s;t of rea&s;ons in favour of a new government in this Di&s;trict; and that is, <HI>the appointment of &s;uch State officers as now are, or in future may be, in the gift of the federal admin|i&s;tration.</HI> We are now con&s;idered by the federal govern|ment, merely as a part of, or rather as an appendage to, the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.

of the State at large, our &s;ituation is at pre&s;ent &s;uch as does not entitle us to the expectation of being benefited by them. I will mention only one in&s;tance, which has late|ly happened.</P>
<P>By the pa&s;&s;ing of the exci&s;e bill, which Congre&s;s have now agreed to, there is an officer in each State, called a Supervi|&s;or of the exci&s;e. The emoluments of this office, will be hand&s;ome; but the Pre&s;ident of the United States could not with propriety appoint to it a per&s;on who&s;e place of re&s;idence is remote from the capital. Indeed, his duty re|quires that he &s;hould appoint a man &s;ituated in the centre of the bu&s;ine&s;s. As there is one of the&s;e officers only in each State, if we had been a &s;eparate government at the time of pa&s;&s;ing the before mentioned bill, the country in general, and very probably the town of Portland in par|ticular, would have been benefited by the appointment of a Supervi&s;or of the exci&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The States of Newhamp&s;hire and Vermont have been benefited by the appointment of a Supervi&s;or of the exci&s;e, when neither of them are &s;o ju&s;tly intitled to the advantage as we are; becau&s;e we pay a greater &s;um for impo&s;t and exci&s;e than either of tho&s;e States.</NOTE></P>
<P>It does not require the &s;pirit of prophecy to predict, that we &s;hall con&s;tantly be in the way of &s;imilar advantages, &s;hould we become a di&s;tinct member of the Union. But, &s;o long as we continue in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, we can have no rea&s;on to expect the enjoyment of any of them.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations it may be added, that our dignity and re&s;pectability will be increa&s;ed, by our becoming a member of the great federal body; and when it is found that our governmental concerns are well managed in the hands of our own publick men, the idea will create a cer|tain
<PB N="25" REF="023313_0023_0FBF02E1158DDA50">
regard and attachment to the welfare of the Di&s;trict, which will tend to ripen and expand the noble principles of patrioti&s;m, in the minds of tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to feel for the pro&s;perity of their country.</P>
<P><HI>The pay now expended in Bo&s;ton, by the Senators and Repre|&s;entatives of the people, during their attendance of the General Court,</HI> will centre at the &s;eat of the new government; and the circulation of it be thence extended into the country.&mdash; Wherever this place may be, it will be more rapidly &s;et|tled by men in trade than it otherwi&s;e would; who may not only benefit them&s;elves but the whole country by the circulation of their property. Such are our advantages for &s;hip building and navigation, that the number of wealthy importers of their own goods, will probably be increa&s;ed.&mdash; They will by the&s;e means be able to di&s;po&s;e of them at a lower price than they can now be purcha&s;ed at; the bene|fits of which will be extended to the poor and indu&s;trious part of the country.</P>
<P>We &s;hall al&s;o <HI>reap the advantages of the growth and increa&s;e of the country,</HI> by di&s;&s;olving our connection with the pre|&s;ent government. This argument does not operate with the &s;ame force now, as it did before the late a&s;&s;umption of the greater part of the State debt. But it &s;till has weight, becau&s;e there is &s;till a publick debt to be provided for, and becau&s;e the expen&s;es of a new government will not increa&s;e in proportion to the increa&s;e of the people.</P>
<P>In order to demon&s;trate its importance, let it be con&s;ider|ed, that our part of the publick taxes, before the la&s;t valua|tion was taken, was about one eleventh of the whole. &mdash; This valuation was ordered to be taken in the year 1783; and was completed in the latter part of the year 1785.&mdash;
<PB N="26" REF="023313_0024_0FBF02E21313B678">
But &s;uch is the increa&s;e of our numbers &s;ince that time, that if a valuation &s;hould be taken in the pre&s;ent year, and the taxes afterwards laid upon the polls only, we &s;hould pay nearly, if not quite, <HI>one fifth</HI> of the whole taxes of govern+ment. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This cannot be preci&s;ely a&s;certained; becau&s;e the numbers in the Di&s;trict are not yet accurately known; but from the be&s;t accounts the Mar&s;hal can obtain from tho&s;e he has employed to take the cen&s;us, and from his own enumeration, our numbers will amount to about &pound;.95,000.</NOTE> I will not undertake to determine how it would be, if the taxes were laid upon the e&s;tates as well as the polls; becau&s;e it is not certain that our property increa&s;es in proportion to our numbers. But admiting our num|ber of inhabitants to be 95,000, and tho&s;e to the we&s;t of Newhamp&s;hire, to be 378,787 (which is the return of the Mar&s;hal of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Di&s;trict) our proportion to their's is about as one to four&mdash;as common arithmetick will de|mon&s;trate.&mdash;Now, if we had obtained a &s;eparation, when our proportion of the publick debt, and other pub|lick burthens, were only a tenth, allowing that we had made no provi&s;ion to reduce them, it would now have been only half as difficult to pay them as it was then; becau&s;e we now have double the number of inhabitants to apportion them upon. And &s;uch is the effect of the increa&s;e of our country in this re&s;pect, that if we delay the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;eparation until after a new valuation is ordered to be tak|en, our proportion of the taxes of the pre&s;ent government, will fall very little &s;hort of double the &s;um to what it was &s;even years ago.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution of the Commonwealth, the General Court are obliged to order a valuation to be taken once in ten years; and as much oftener as the publick good may require. As it is now more than &s;even years &s;ince the la&s;t

<P>The whole of this debt, before the a&s;&s;umption of about four fifths of it by Congre&s;s, amounted to upwards of five millions of dollars; four millions of which are now taken into the hands of Congre&s;s, and mu&s;t be provided for out of the re&s;ources of the general government. We have, therefore, nothing to do with it. The balance, or that part una&s;&s;umed, and which the Commonwealth have now to provide for, will in the beginning of the year 1792, and including the intere&s;t, amount to &pound;.560,000. To this is to be added about &pound;.75,000, now due from the trea&s;ury of the Commonwealth to individuals, and is commonly called the debt due by warrants and due bills (which includes the orders upon back taxes) amounting in the whole to the &s;um of &pound;635,000.</P>

Commi&s;|&s;ioners have been appointed by Congre&s;s, to receive and al|low the demands of this nature, which the &s;everal States have again&s;t the United States.

<P>In order to di&s;charge the &pound;.75,000, due, as beforemen|tioned, by warrants and due bills, we have more than that &s;um due to the trea&s;ury, upon taxes prior to No. 8, which is already appropriated for that purpo&s;e. Whenever the collection of the&s;e taxes is enforced, we &s;hall find the trea|&s;ury of the Commonwealth quite clear of debt. But, ad|mitting that I am too &s;anguine in my expectations from the &s;ettlement of our demands again&s;t the United States; we have continental &s;ecurities now in the trea&s;ury, to the amount of &pound;.90.000, the price of which is daily increa&s;|ing, and will &s;oon ri&s;e to their nominal value. There is &pound;100,000 in &s;pecie due to the Commonwealth, from the late purcha&s;er of the Gene&s;ee lands &mdash; Me&s;&s;iers Gorham and Phelps's bond to the Commonwealth for &pound;.100,000, in con&s;olidated notes, which the General Court have agreed to receive at 6<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> in the pound&mdash;&pound;73.000, the proceeds of 750,000 acres of ea&s;tern lands already &s;old; and the whole amount of taxes No. 8 &amp; 9 amounting to &pound;55,000.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the agreeable pro&s;pect which ari&s;es from the fore|going &s;tatement&punc; we have to mention, that the committee for &s;ale of ea&s;tern lands compute, that we have about eight millions of acres in the whole territory, which is daily &s;elling, and daily increa&s;ing in value. Some parts of
<PB N="30" REF="023313_0028_0FBF02EBA91B6C18">
it are more valuable than others, and of cour&s;e will &s;ell at a greater price; but I believe none of it has been &s;old for more than 2<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> nor le&s;s than 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per acre. Suppo&s;e the whole to average 1<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per acre. the amount will be 400,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>

<P>The foregoing &s;tatement is made without including in the credit of the Commonwealth any &s;um we are to receive from the United States, as the balance of our account again&s;t them. And the reader will perceive that no di&s;|count is made upon the continental paper, from the idea that it will &s;oon ri&s;e to its nominal value.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="023313_0029_0FBF02EF28190F78">I think it mu&s;t now plainly appear, that the unembar|ra&s;&s;ed, or rather the pro&s;perous &s;tate of the trea&s;ury of the Commonwealth, is a great rea&s;on in favour of our &s;epara|tion from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Indeed, it is very evident, that if the publick property &s;hould be judiciou&s;ly managed, it might be put into &s;uch a &s;ituation as &s;peedily to pay off the publick debt; and the re&s;idue might be appropriated in &s;uch a manner as to produce an income which would go far towards defraying the annual expen&s;es of the civil li&s;t. &mdash; When this happy period will arrive, I cannot under|take to &s;ay; but &s;ure I am, that the proportion of the pub|lick property which belongs to this Di&s;trict, whenever it comes into the hands of a Legi&s;lature of our own, may be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of as to produce the happie&s;t effects to the community.</P>
<P N="2">II. I WILL now, according to my propo&s;ed original intention, &s;tate, and endeavour to obviate, &s;uch objections as have been rai&s;ed again&s;t a &s;eparate government in the Di&s;trict of Maine.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, <HI>that multiplying the number of States will be very inconvenient; and productive of di&s;agreeable con&s;equen|ces, to the general intere&s;t of the nation.</HI>&mdash;This was a real and weighty objection in my mind, while the States were under the confederation. The ab&s;olute and unlimited &s;overeignty with which each State was then inve&s;ted, ren|dered the general, and particularly the commercial intere&s;t of the Union extremely perplexed. In tho&s;e deci&s;ions, where the various intere&s;ts of the exten&s;ive whole were affect+ed, unanimity was out of the que&s;tion; and as deci&s;ions of this kind were frequently made, an increa&s;e of the num|ber of States would then have been an increa&s;e of their perplexities &mdash;But the &s;tate of the Union, in this re&s;|pect,
<PB N="32" REF="023313_0030_0FBF02F0F3367940">
is far different from what it then was. That excel|lent and &s;ublime production of human genius, the federal con&s;titution, has bound the United States together, with la&s;ting cords, in the &s;ure bundle of national pro&s;perity.&mdash; The divi&s;ion of a State is now no longer an evil; but by being properly conducted, may be converted into an im|portant advantage. The great objection again&s;t it, which formerly exi&s;ted, is now removed. It is now no longer in the power of a &s;ingle State in the Union, to prevent the adoption of wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary regulations, merely by ob|&s;tinately withholding its con&s;ent to them. Having provid|ed again&s;t this evil by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal con|&s;titution, we may now offer the &s;ame rea&s;on for dividing a State, when the intere&s;t or convenience of its inhabitants require it, as would operate in favour of dividing a town, in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. The object of the State Legi&s;latures is now, merely, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch local laws and regulations, as will tend to make all the burthens of government re&s;t lightly upon the &s;houlders of the people. The management of all the intricate and weighty concerns of government, as has been &s;hewn in a former page, is in the hands of Con|gre&s;s. Tho&s;e of a le&s;s important nature can always be more under&s;tandingly managed by a Legi&s;lature in the vicinity of its con&s;tituents. Perhaps the true intere&s;t of the Unit|ed States at large requires, that their number &s;hould be in|crea&s;ed. I will &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, the time to be now arrived, when, according to the number of the inhabitants in the United States, the federal Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of two hundred members, and the number of &s;tates to be the &s;ame as when the con&s;titution was framed. There being no increa&s;e of the number of States, and of cour&s;e no increa&s;e of the number of federal Senators, it would be in the power of fourteen men to put a negative
<PB N="33" REF="023313_0031_0FBF02F3218442E0">
upon a law, which two hundred of the Repre&s;entatives of the people believed to be nece&s;&s;ary and productive of the publick good. This is a &s;triking proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing the number of States, in order that the ari&s;tocrat|ick branch of the federal Legi&s;lature &s;hould bear a greater proportion, in point of numbers, to that branch which is cho&s;en more immediately by the people.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been objected, <HI>that the difficulty of adju&s;ting and &s;ettling our proportion of the publick debt, and of the unimproved lands which now belong to the Commonwealth, will be in&s;ur|mountable.</HI>&mdash;The former of the&s;e difficulties, I tru&s;t, is now removed by the pro&s;perous change of our affairs con|cerning it. As to the latter, that of dividing the State lands, I can &s;ee no difficulty at all in the bu&s;ine&s;s. If a divi&s;ion of them takes place, it is not to be expected that our &s;everal proportions can be a&s;certained to a &s;ingle acre. We have now &s;uch &s;urveys of them, as to render their quantity generally known. But perhaps there is no nece&s;|&s;ity of their being divided in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things. Let the pre&s;ent committee for their &s;ale be continued in their office, and authori&s;ed to go on to di&s;po&s;e of them, on the joint account of the two States. It will be ea&s;y to a&s;|certain and &s;ettle our proportion of the proceeds;&mdash;and whatever that proportion is, we may either have credit for the amount in the trea&s;ury of the Commonwealth, if that &s;hould be found convenient, after the terms of our &s;epara|tion are agreed upon; if not, it may be paid immediately into our own trea&s;ury. I can fore&s;ee no po&s;&s;ible injury that will accrue to us from this mode of conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;We &s;hall, at all events, retain the juri&s;diction over the land which may be in this manner &s;old; and thus avail our&s;elves, not only of our proportion of the money which the lands may &s;ell for, but reap the advantages and
<PB N="34" REF="023313_0032_0FBF02F4EBE9BAD0">
&s;upports which a &s;ettlement of them by indu&s;trious citizens will afford to the government.</P>
<P>Another objection, and which I have lately heard made to our &s;eparation from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, is, <HI>that it will be the means of transferring to the federal Judicial Courts, all actions and controver&s;ies between the citizens of the two States.</HI>&mdash;It is certainly true, that being citizens of different States, in ca&s;e a &s;eparation is obtained, their controver&s;ies of a cer|tain kind and amount will be cognizable in the Di&s;trict or Circuit Courts of the United States. But it is al&s;o true, that when a plaintiff in any action thus cognizable, choo&s;es a federal juri&s;diction, it will be in <HI>favour</HI> of the citizens of this Di&s;trict. For by the judicial bill of the United States it is enacted, "That no citizen &s;hall be arre&s;ted in one Di&s;|trict for trial in another, in any civil action, before a Di&s;|trict or Circuit Court. And no civil action &s;hall be bro't before either of &s;aid Courts again&s;t an inhabitant of the United States by any original proce&s;s in any other Di&s;trict, than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he &s;hall be found at the time of the &s;ervice of the writ." In&s;tead, therefore, of being liable to be called to an&s;wer to the ac|tions of parties in di&s;tant counties of the Commonwealth, as we now are, the certain con&s;equence of a &s;eparation will be, that no citizen can be &s;ued in any court of law, <HI>in any ca&s;e whatever,</HI> which is not holden in &s;ome part of the Di&s;trict, unle&s;s he happens to be arre&s;ted when he is out of it. For no proce&s;s proceeding from the Judicial Courts of a State, can run into, or be executed in, any place that is not within the State where it is i&s;&s;ued. And by the fore|going extract it appears, that no civil action can be in&s;ti|tuted again&s;t an inhabitant of the United States, in any of the federal Courts, which are not holden in the Di&s;trict where he has his re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="023313_0033_0FBF02F62BC51400">The con&s;equences of a &s;eparation on this account, thus appear to be <HI>in favour</HI> of the mea&s;ure, in&s;tead of operating again&s;t it. The &s;candalous practice, which has too long prevailed, of negociating notes of hand merely for the pur|po&s;e of increa&s;ing the co&s;t of &s;uing them (by commencing actions upon them in the extreme corners of the State in the name of nominal or fictitious plaintiffs) will be effectu|ally aboli&s;hed. The unfortunate, and perhaps indigent debtor, by this means, has been frequently loaded with a bill of co&s;t, equal to, if not greater, than the &s;um he has been &s;ued for; to the di&s;grace of the hard hearted creditor who con&s;ented to it, and the avaricious attorney who en|couraged and conducted the &s;uit.</P>
<P>But, in many in&s;tances, the real plaintiff may live in a di&s;tant county, and will be ju&s;tified in calling the party with whom he is contending as near to his own door as po&s;&s;ible. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the enormous &s;ums of money which are now paid for bills of co&s;t, and other expen&s;es in|curred by the travel and attendance of parties and their witne&s;&s;es, will be &s;aved to tho&s;e who are obliged to attend the judicial courts in the we&s;t and &s;outh parts of the Com|monwealth.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e con&s;iderations a&s;ide, I apprehend the peo|ple will continue to be too partial to the judicial courts of the State, to wi&s;h to change them for any other. And without entering into an examination of the comparative merit or advantages of the two juri&s;dictions, we may &s;afe|ly conclude that there is no danger of the federal court's being preferred to tho&s;e which we &s;hall hereafter in&s;titute by a Legi&s;lature of our own chu&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>A want of learned and experienced men,</HI> has been alleged as
<PB N="36" REF="023313_0034_0FBF02F8697D1BE8">
an unan&s;werable argument again&s;t a new government.&mdash; Tho&s;e who are weak enough to make this objection, ought to be acquainted, not only with the character of the inhabi|tants of the Di&s;trict in general, and tho&s;e in particular who have already &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in politicks, but al&s;o with the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s they will be called to tran&s;|act. It is improper to particularize any number of gentle|men, who&s;e abilities might be proved equal to the duties of any office they may be called to &s;u&s;tain under the new government. But the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s may be con|&s;idered and explained, and the people hereby a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming an opinion as to the probability of its being per+formed with honour to the government, and credit to tho&s;e who may be employed in it.</P>
<P>The executive, legi&s;lative, and judicial departments of government, are tho&s;e which will mo&s;t require the exer|ci&s;e of abilities, integrity and indu&s;try.&mdash;For the fir&s;t, nothing more will be required than di&s;cretion, &s;ound judg|ment, an acquaintance with the world and with publick life. The &s;tructure of mo&s;t, if not all the con&s;titutions on the continent, have denied to this department the exerci&s;e of any powers, which even an improper u&s;e of, could ren|der very prejudicial to the people. But notwith&s;tanding this, the per&s;on who is called to fill it, has an opportunity of gaining &s;uch an a&s;cendency over the minds of the peo|ple, that by a prudent management of their confidence, he may in &s;ome mea&s;ure direct the politicks of the State.&mdash; The place, however, that is commonly a&s;&s;igned him by the frame of government, rather con&s;titutes him a re&s;pectable ma&s;ter of ceremony, than gives to him the exerci&s;e of any important powers. In this, neither &s;ublimity of genius, nor profundity of erudition, are <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="023313_0035_0FBF02FF326AFB80">As to the &s;econd, viz. the legi&s;lative department, we may ob&s;erve, as we have repeatedly done before, that the mo&s;t difficult and important bu&s;ine&s;s of it is transfered to the general government. With re&s;pect to the re&s;idue, it is chiefly done already. The pre&s;ent code of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts laws (except tho&s;e which will require alteration or amend|ment before they are put in operation here) will doubtle&s;s be adopted. There are enough of them in all con&s;cience; and I &s;incerely believe, that if there was not another to be added to them which would affect the general regulations of property, or the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, it would be far better than the continual change through which they have pa&s;&s;ed for the la&s;t &s;even years.</P>
<P>The future bu&s;ine&s;s of a General Court, after the gov|ernment is once firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, will con&s;i&s;t principally of &s;uch local regulations as any men of common under&s;tand|ing and &s;ound judgment will be capable of making. I tru&s;t we have as great a proportion of &s;uch men in the Di&s;trict of Maine, as there are in any part of the Commonwealth. We may, therefore, go on with a new government, on this account, with the utmo&s;t &s;afety.</P>
<P>But the judicial department mu&s;t be filled by men of great abilities and integrity, in order to in&s;ure a happy ad|mini&s;tration of the new government. Much of its digni|ty and importance will depend upon a bench of Supreme Judges, filled by men of this character. For the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t laws may be enacted by the legi&s;lature; but the peo|ple cannot enjoy the benefit of them, unle&s;s they are wi&s;e|ly interpreted, and put in operation, by the Judicial Courts.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf that four or five men may be found in the Di&s;trict of Maine, who&s;e knowledge of the law, who&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="023313_0036_0FBF030242D15BF8">
integrity and judgment will be found equal to an honoura|ble di&s;charge of the duties of a Supreme Court. A know|ledge of the intricate and ab&s;tru&s;e points of law, will doubt|le&s;s be of &s;ervice to them; at lea&s;t &s;o far as to guard them again&s;t any unju&s;t attempts of the gentlemen of the bar, to mi&s;lead them. Sound judgment, quick penetration, pa|tient inve&s;tigation, and candid deliberate inquiry, together with a knowledge of the general principles of law, will go very far to make up the character of a valuable and an up|right Judge. We certainly have more than five men in the Di&s;trict who are in every re&s;pect de&s;erving this charac|ter. I could enumerate double the number without the lea&s;t he&s;itation.</P>
<P>We &s;hall have &s;till le&s;s difficulty to encounter from the &s;uppo&s;ed want of men of learning and experience in form+ing a con&s;titution. We &s;hall have at lea&s;t fourteen models before us to &s;elect from, &s;ome of which are allowed, both in Europe and America, to contain the utmo&s;t perfection of human wi&s;dom in matters of civil policy. The con&s;titution of this Commonwealth in particular, under the authority of which we have been &s;o long and &s;o happily governed, has been generally reckoned one of the be&s;t. That of the United States, which contains the collected wi&s;dom of the whole continent, varies from it but in &s;ome few in&s;tances. In forming one for our&s;elves, we &s;hall have, not only the advantage of comparing the two together, and judging for our&s;elves upon that compari&s;on; but we &s;hall al&s;o be able to correct any errors in the former which a ten year's ex|perience and practice upon it, may dictate.</P>
<P>The la&s;t objection which I &s;hall attempt to an&s;wer, ari&s;es from an opinion <HI>that the expences of the new government will exceed our proportion of the pre&s;ent.</HI>&mdash; This objection depends
<PB N="39" REF="023313_0037_0FBF0303B429B2E0">
entirely upon the future conduct of the people. If they mean to throw away their money by &s;upporting a great number of u&s;ele&s;s officers in luxury and debauchery, the objection is certainly well founded. But if, on the con|trary, they are determined to create no more of them than may be found nece&s;&s;ary for the management of the affairs of the State with propriety and di&s;patch, and to allow them &s;uch &s;alaries as will be a hand&s;ome equivalent for their &s;ervi|ces, and <HI>no more,</HI> it will be found that we &s;hall <HI>&s;ave money</HI> by the exchange of governments.</P>
<P>The expen&s;es of the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts before the adoption of the federal con&s;titution, amounted annually to &pound;.18,000; but &s;ince that time, they have been con&s;ider|ably le&s;s. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the General Court does not now take up &s;o much time, as it then did; and the pay of the members of Congre&s;s, which was then a State charge, is now taken from the trea&s;ury of the United States. The&s;e two circum&s;tances have reduced the annual expen&s;e of the pre|&s;ent government to &pound;. 15,000. The proportion of this &s;um which the citizens of this Di&s;trict will pay after a new valu|ation is taken, being one fifth, will be &pound;.3000. As has been formerly ob&s;erved, we mu&s;t expect that the General Court will order a new valuation to be taken in the cour&s;e of the next year. Our calculations, therefore, ought all to be made according to the proportion of taxes which we &s;hall be obliged to pay after that time: Becau&s;e, let us be ever &s;o expeditious, we &s;hall be probably more than a year in &s;ettling the terms of our &s;eparation with the government, and in obtaining the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I will now exhibit an e&s;timate of the expen&s;es of a govern|ment in this Di&s;trict which will fall &s;ome what &s;hort of
<PB N="40" REF="023313_0038_0FBF030629AB6390">

<P>In the fir&s;t place, the &s;um of &pound;300 will be an ample &s;up|port for the Chief Magi&s;trate, whom I choo&s;e to call a <HI>Gov|ernour.</HI> For as the federal con&s;titution allows no title ex|cept that of <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> to the fir&s;t man in the nation (and while the office is &s;u&s;tained by its pre&s;ent illu&s;trious po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or,

I may add, the fir&s;t man in the world) to give the &s;ame title to the Chief Magi&s;trate of a &s;ingle State, will be found not only improper, but inconvenient.</P>
<P>But in order to &s;hew that the &s;um of &pound;.300 is ample for the &s;upport of a Governour, it may be &s;aid, that their is no part of the Di&s;trict where that &s;um, regularly paid and economically expended, will not &s;upport a family in as good a &s;tile as will be con&s;i&s;tant with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in this part of the country. The refinements of luxury in this wooden world would be rediculous. Be&s;ides the pernicious example of idlene&s;s which they would &s;et be|fore the people, the catalogue of vices they would engen|der might alarm and affright the plain hone&s;t citizen. We have no occa&s;ion, therefore, to make any allowance for the expen&s;es they would create.</P>
<P>An attention to a little private bu&s;ine&s;s would be not at all incompatible with the true dignity of a Governour. By this means he might not only increa&s;e his property, but &s;et an example of indu&s;try to the publick. From the pe|culiarity of our &s;ituation he would be unexpo&s;ed to many expen&s;es which devolve upon Governours of others States, by the vi&s;its of &s;trangers of di&s;tinction, whom decency obliges them to notice.</P>
<P>The next article in the foregoing e&s;timate, is an allow|ance of 6<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per day for ten Senators, &s;uppo&s;ing their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to require their attendance 60 days in a year.

It is 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> le&s;s per day than our pre&s;ent Senators have received for &s;ome years pa&s;t. This &s;um will not be thought too large; the doubt as to this ar|ticle is, whether 60 days in a year will be a &s;ufficient allow|ance

of time for their bu&s;ine&s;s to be done in. We mu&s;t form our opinion upon this point, by comparing the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the whole Commonwealth with what will probably ari&s;e hereafter in this Di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the federal con&s;titution, has generally &s;at from eigh|ty to ninety days in the year. Much of that time has been taken up, in debating upon &s;ubjects which we &s;hall have nothing to do with in future. From the great number of people in the Commonwealth, who have con&s;tant occa&s;ion to apply to the Legi&s;lature for remedies which no other tri|bunal in the government can provide, their private bu&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;arily occupies a great &s;hare of their attention; perhaps a much greater, than that of a publick nature. The num|bers of this Di&s;trict being much le&s;s, the bu&s;ine&s;s of our fu|ture General Court will be le&s;s of cour&s;e. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, it may be fairly concluded, that although more than &s;ixty days in a year may be nece&s;&s;ary upon the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Government, in order to put it into operation, yet, after that time, the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of it will not re|quire more than fifty or &s;ixty days at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The number of Senators will doubtle&s;s be as many as twelve, but not more than ten out of the number will be con&s;tantly attending the General Court.</P>
<P>The travel of the Senators and of the Repre&s;entatives mu&s;t both be paid out of the publick che&s;t. I have com|puted this at &pound;.75, allowing twenty miles travel to be equal to a day's attendance (which is the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom) and &s;uppo&s;ing the number of Repre&s;entatives to be forty, and their travel to average each a hundred miles, including the di&s;tance to and from the &s;eat of government. Forty Rep|re&s;entatives
<PB N="43" REF="023313_0041_0FBF031162C94218">
are as few as we can expect the General Court to con&s;i&s;t of, when we con&s;ider that there are now &s;ixty nine incorporated towns in the Di&s;trict which have a right to be repre&s;ented, and al&s;o the number of plantations which will immediately upon a &s;eparation, receive the privileges of incorporation. And it will be found that the allowance of 100 miles travel to each Senator and Repre&s;entative is as much as the whole travel will average for a number of years to come, if the place for the &s;eat of the new govern|ment &s;hould be, as it undoubtedly will be, fixed upon in the center of the inhabitants, and not of the territory.</P>
<P>The allowance of 5<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> a day for the pay of the Repre&s;en|tatives, is 1<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> le&s;s than what has been u&s;ually allowed by the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. But as the expen&s;es of living in this Di&s;trict will be &s;omewhat le&s;s than they are in Bo&s;ton, this &s;um will be an adequate compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Secretary will be an important officer, and ought to be fully compen&s;ated. The &s;um I have allowed him, to|gether with &s;uch perqui&s;ites of his office as will naturally accrue, will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer is a more re&s;pon&s;ible officer than the Sec|retary, and the duties of his office more intricate and labo|rious; he will therefore be entitled to a larger &s;alary. His office will admit of &s;o few perqui&s;ites, and require &s;uch con|&s;tant attention, that &pound;. 120 will not be more than a com|pen&s;ation for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The allowance of &pound;.30 for each of the Clerks, will be nearly if not quite equal to the pay of the members of the General Court. They cannot expect to be better provided for than their employers; but the tedious bu&s;ine&s;s of their office entitles them to be made nearly equal to them. The&s;e,

together with the Me&s;&s;enger and Chaplain, will be proper|ly provided for, but naming the preci&s;e &s;ums is of little im|portance.</P>
<P>The Chief Ju&s;tice, and the A&s;&s;ociate Judges of the Su|preme Court ought, above all the other officers of govern|ment, to be liberally paid.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;alaries of the Chief Ju&s;tice of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is &pound;.370, that of the other Judges &pound;.350 each.</NOTE> The duty of the Chief Ju&s;tice is of &s;uch a nature as entitles him to a larger &s;um than his A&s;&s;ociates, were the dignity of his office out of the que&s;tion.

When the very nature of it is, to add to the weight of affliction with which the wretched criminal is loaded, what a mi&s;erable alleviation is money to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a feeling heart!</P>
<P>The &s;um of &pound;.200 which I have allowed for the &s;alaries of the pui&s;ne Judges, will not be &s;ufficient to &s;upport their families, and to pay their traveling expen&s;es. They ought therefore to be higher, if the abilities of the people were equal to it, to enable them to devote that time to &s;tudy, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be employed in procuring a liveli|hood. They ought to be placed beyond the reach of temptation, by being honourably provided for by the gov|ernment. They can pur&s;ue no other bu&s;ine&s;s to advantage while their duty obliges them to be often upon the circuit; and if any of the bar &s;hould be advanced to that honoura|ble &s;tation, they could have no other means of &s;upport.&mdash; But it is a nigardly idea, that the publick officers &s;hould be

Why &s;hould the man who gives him&s;elf up to the &s;ervice of his country, be the only one who is precluded from a moderate increa&s;e of his e&s;|tate? It ought to be con&s;idered, that &s;uch men have chil|dren, who&s;e education and advancement in the world de|pend altogether upon their exertions; that if the proceeds of their offices are expended in the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uport of their families, the&s;e children mu&s;t be brought up in ignorance; and that annexing a low and pitiful &s;alary to the mo&s;t im|portant offices in the community, will be the probable means of having them filled by ignorant or unprincipled men.</P>
<P>The office of Attorney General ought al&s;o to be filled by a man of integrity and abilities. It is an office, upon the faithful di&s;charge of which, depends much of the pro&s;peri|ty of the government. The Attorney General ought to be equal, in point of learning and abilities, to any of the Judges of the Supreme Court; and if the re&s;pon&s;ibility, labour, and di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s of the office were duly attended to, he would appear to be entitled to an equal &s;alary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;alary of the pre&s;ent Attorney General is &pound;.300.</NOTE> It in a great mea&s;ure throws him out of other bu&s;ine&s;s; and renders him in &s;ome degree an unpopular character.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>I have omitted to in&s;ert in the e&s;timate any &s;um for the annual con|tingent expen&s;es of government.

But it is almo&s;t certain they will fall &s;hort of our pre&s;ent proportion of that &s;pecies of expen&s;e, which is now incurred in the Commonwealth. The enormous &s;ums of money which are annually granted for the &s;upport of the <HI>State's poor</HI> and of <HI>Ca&s;tle William,</HI> make a great proportion of this expen&s;e.</P>
<P>From February 1789 to June 1790, the General Court granted the &s;um of &pound;.6786 3 10, for the &s;upport of the State's poor and of Bo&s;ton alms hou&s;e; and in June 1788, another &s;um of &pound;.3500 for the &s;upport of <HI>Ca&s;tle William</HI>&mdash;amounting in the whole to the enormous &s;um of &pound;.10,286 3 10. Although in Ju&s;tice we ought to take our proportion of the State's poor, &s;hould a &s;eparation take place, yet it may be ob&s;erved that this will be only a temporary burthen. As Bo&s;ton, from its exten&s;ive trade, is the principal re&s;ort of foreigners, the number of per&s;ons who are intitled to the charity of government will generally center in that capital. But we may add that our proportion of the public property, &s;uch as the <HI>State Hou&s;e,</HI> the publick <HI>Ar&s;enals,</HI> &amp;c. will balance the expen&s;e of that part of the public poor which will &s;ail upon us for a maintenance.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="023313_0044_0FBF0316B9FD2B48">It has probably been noticed, that the beforemention|ed e&s;timate does not contain an allowance for the &s;alary of a Lieutenant Governour, nor the pay of a Council. My rea&s;on for omitting them is, that they will both be un|nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a form of government as might be &s;afe|ly adopted. The con&s;titution of the Commonwealth does not give to the Lieutenant Governour a &s;ingle particle of power, in any ca&s;e whatever, excepting in the ab&s;ence of the Chief Magi&s;trate. Whenever therefore the Gover|nour is able to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, the Lieutenant Gover|nour has nothing to do, excepting as a member of the Council, which he always is, by virtue of his office. And if it &s;hould appear, that a Council may be &s;afely omitted in our new form of government, it will follow that a Lieut. Governour will be a u&s;ele&s;s and &s;uperfluous officer; a mere cypher in the government, without any authority to make him or his office re&s;pectable. In &s;hort, he would be noth|ing more than a kind of death watch to the Governour, waiting, and perhaps <HI>wi&s;hing</HI> for his decea&s;e, or removal.&mdash; The Pre&s;ident of the Senate may be appointed to &s;ucceed the Chief Magi&s;trate, in ca&s;e of his death, or removal from office; and the parade and expen&s;e of a Lieut.

He might receive his pay as a member of the Senate, without any additional &s;alary, in which ca&s;e the increa&s;e of expen&s;e would be very trifling.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="023313_0045_0FBF031BA960D988">A Council to advi&s;e the Governour, would in my opin|ion be equally unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;As an authority for this o|pinion, I need only cite the con&s;titution of the United States. By that con&s;titution there is no &s;et of men ap|pointed as a di&s;tinct branch of the government, merely to advi&s;e the Pre&s;ident. But in the exerci&s;e of all the mo&s;t important powers with which he is inve&s;ted, he acts by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate. If, therefore, in a government &s;o complex, and which is de&s;igned to be ex|erci&s;ed over &s;uch an exten&s;ive empire as that of the United States, a Council has not been found to be nece&s;&s;ary, we may with &s;afety be without one in the government of a territory &s;o comparatively &s;mall.</P>
<P>The only objection to this plan is, that it in &s;ome degree blends the legi&s;lative and executive departments; but the principle of civil policy on which this is founded, may be too much refined upon. Our Governour will have little el&s;e to con&s;ult the Senate upon, than the appointment of civil officers. Perhaps it would be as well, if he was left to act independently of the advice of any branch of the gov|ernment. His re&s;pon&s;ibility would in this ca&s;e be greater, and the inducements to a faithful di&s;charge of his tru&s;t, proportionably increa&s;ed. Should he be di&s;po&s;ed to make an improper appointment, the con&s;equences would then re&s;t upon his own head, without his having the advice and con&s;ent of a Council or Senate, behind which to &s;creen him&s;elf.</P>

<P>But, admitting that we had not this rea&s;onable claim upon their impartiality, they have virtually given their con&s;ent to our &s;eparation, by erecting us into a Di&s;trict, &s;e|parate from, and independent of the Di&s;trict of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. They have done more; they have given the Judge of this Di&s;trict the powers of the Circuit Courts of the United States. What could induce them to do this, but a conviction that we ought now to be a State by our&s;elves? Their conduct in this in&s;tance mu&s;t have originated from
<PB N="53" REF="023313_0051_0FBF0330AC0E55E8">
a per&s;ua&s;ion, that we cannot with convenience hold any communion or intercour&s;e with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in the con|cerns of government. The circum&s;tance that our Di&s;trict Judge is inve&s;ted with circuit powers, operates in our fa|vour with double force; for it amounts to full proof that Congre&s;s were &s;en&s;ible, not only of the great impropriety of our being annexed to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, but con&s;idered us &s;o &s;eparated from them, that a Circuit Court could not travel into the Di&s;trict without manife&s;t inconvenience.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the &s;ubject, in the manner that was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed. I pre&s;ume its importance, however deficient I may have been in con&s;idering it, will induce ev|ery citizen of the Di&s;trict to make a candid enquiry into its merits. For he may be a&s;&s;ured, however indifferent he may feel at pre&s;ent, that the time is fa&s;t approaching when he will be called to decide upon it for him&s;elf and for his po&s;terity. From this con&s;ideration, I hope the &s;ources of every kind of information, will be laid open, for the bene|fit of the indu&s;trious enquirer. No re&s;olutions ought to be ha&s;tily adopted; becau&s;e, in order to form a right judg|ment upon the propo&s;ed &s;eparation, the advantages and di&s;advantages ought to be laid together, and thoroughly examined. Although I am clearly of the opinion, that we &s;hould gain much by the event, our &s;ituation at pre&s;ent is not &s;o deplorable, but that we &s;hall find our advantage in proceeding with coolne&s;s and moderation. Every po&s;&s;ible precaution ought to be taken, again&s;t the exerci&s;e of that fiery zeal, which blazes no where but in the brea&s;ts of am|bitious men.</P>
<P><HI>Fellow citizens!</HI> guard your&s;elves again&s;t the effects of ambition, that dangerous, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, which too often
<PB N="54" REF="023313_0052_0FBF03322C40BC40">
predominates in the human heart. If you find men whom you believe to be governed by it, placing them&s;elves at the head of the important bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;eparate government, when they <HI>a&s;&s;ault</HI> you with the pomp and parade of patrio|ti&s;m, <HI>"turn not a&s;ide to follow after them."</HI> Tru&s;t your cau&s;e with the moderate and judicious part of the community; and be a&s;&s;ured, that in due time it will terminate in the ef|fectual e&s;tabli&s;hment of your public and private felicity.</P>
