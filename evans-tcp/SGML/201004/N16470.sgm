<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR RECOVERING PERSONS, WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE Dead, from Drowning, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OF the many calamities to which mankind are &s;ubject, there are none more produc|tive of di&s;tre&s;s, than &s;udden and violent deaths.</P>
<P>IN great cities, in&s;tances of this kind (from drowning, &s;uffocation and other accidents) are very numerous; and this melancholy circum|&s;tance is much aggravated by reflecting, that a large proportion of tho&s;e who are thus lo&s;t to their friends and country, might be &s;aved if they were properly treated.</P>
<P>THAT this is the ca&s;e, appears clearly from the reports of &s;everal re&s;pectable &s;ocieties in Europe, which were formed for the purpo&s;e, and have happily &s;ucceeded in the humane attempt, of re&s;toring to life, per&s;ons apparently killed by the accidents above mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="021159_0003_0FB24D85A8AB6468">
IT is now only twenty years &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ociety of this kind was formed at Am&s;terdam, and but thirteen &s;ince the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of that in London, and yet near one thou&s;and per&s;ons have been pre&s;erved from death by the&s;e two in&s;titutions. Societies of the &s;ame kind have been formed at Paris, Venice, Hamburgh and Milan; and from their reports, it al&s;o appears, not only that a large proportion of per&s;ons ap|parently dead, have been recovered, but that this recovery may be effected, after they have been a long time in that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>AS the inhabitants of this part of America are expo&s;ed, not only to all tho&s;e accidents which occur in England and Holland, but to &s;everal others which rarely take place there (as tho&s;e produced by exce&s;&s;ive heat and cold, and by light ning) they mu&s;t have additional inducements to form an in&s;titution of this kind: And altho' its objects are of the highe&s;t im|portance, the following plan for attaining them, will &s;hew, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch an in&s;titution is very practicable and ea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;AS people in general are uninformed of the proper methods to be pur&s;ued in &s;uch ca&s;es, and as medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance cannot always be procured in time, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lodge directions re&s;pecting the proper treat|ment in all tho&s;e places where &s;uch accidents commonly occur.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021159_0004_0FB24D8737D43C80">
<HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;IT will be nece&s;&s;ary to depo&s;it at tho&s;e places, &s;uch apparatus and medicines as have been found mo&s;t u&s;eful in the&s;e ca&s;es; as the time lo&s;t in waiting for them, if they are not at hand, may deprive the unfortunate per&s;on of all chance of recovery.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>&mdash;It will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to place at proper di&s;tances, near rivers, a number of grapples and other in&s;truments, for extract|ing &s;peedily from the water, tho&s;e who fall into it.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e means, the Societies above men|tioned, have had the &s;atisfaction of re&s;toring fa|thers to the fatherle&s;s, and living children to parents who were deploring their lo&s;s;&mdash;and have rendered to humanity, the important &s;er|vice of pre&s;erving from death, a large number of u&s;eful members of the community. Their great &s;ucce&s;s influenced a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia, to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, under the name of the "Hu|mane Society;" who, as they are de&s;irous of the concurrence of their fellow-citizens, have &s;ubjoined their con&s;titution; and hope that tho&s;e who approve of it, will unite with them in carrying it into execution.</P>

<HEAD>The CONSTITUTION of the HUMANE SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THE HUMANE SOCIETY, in&s;tituted in the year 1770, for the reco|very of drowned per&s;ons, having for &s;ome years pa&s;t not been &s;ufficiently attended to, it is now agreed to revive it; and further, to in|clude in its objects, per&s;ons di&s;ordered by noxious vapours, lightning, drinking cold wa|ter, and from the action of exce&s;&s;ive heat and cold upon the body; for which purpo&s;e, the following plan is adopted:&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS, for RECOVERING PERSONS, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be DEAD, from DROWNING.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AS &s;oon as the body is taken out of the water, it mu&s;t be conveyed to a hou&s;e, or any other place, where it can be laid dry and warm, avoiding the u&s;ual de&s;tructive methods <HI>of hanging it by the heels, rolling it on a barrel,</HI> or <HI>placing it acro&s;s a log on its belly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE clothes mu&s;t be immediately &s;trip|ped off, and the body wrapped up in blan|kets, well warmed. It &s;hould be laid on its back, with the head a little rai&s;ed. If the wea|ther be cold, it &s;hould be placed near a fire; but if the weather &s;hould be warm, it will be &s;uf|ficient to place it between two blankets well heated; taking care to prevent the room from being crouded, with any per&s;ons who are not nece&s;&s;arily employed about the body.</P>
<P N="3">III. AS &s;oon as it can po&s;&s;ibly be done, a bellows &s;hould be applied to one no&s;tril, while the other no&s;tril and the mouth are kept clo&s;ed, and the lower end of the prominent part of the wind-pipe (or that part which is called by the anatomi&s;ts, <HI>Pomum Adami</HI>) is pre&s;&s;ed back|ward. The bellows is to be worked in this &s;ituation; and when the brea&s;t is &s;welled by
<PB N="8" REF="021159_0007_0FB24D8BA780FDC8">it, the bellows &s;hould &s;top, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;hould pre&s;s the belly upwards, to force the air out. The bellows &s;hould then be applied as before, and the belly &s;hould again be pre&s;|&s;ed; and this proce&s;s &s;hould be repeated from twenty to thirty times in a minute, &s;o as to imitate natural breathing as nearly as po&s;&s;ible. Some volatile &s;pirits, heated, &s;hould be held under the valve of the bellows, while it works. If a bellows cannot be procured, &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould blow into one of the no&s;trils, through a pipe or quill, while the other no&s;tril and mouth are clo&s;ed as before; or if a pipe or quill be not at hand, he &s;hould blow into the mouth, while both no&s;trils are clo&s;ed; but whenever a bellows can be procured, it &s;hould be pre|ferred, as air forced in by this means, will be much more &s;erviceable than air which has already been breathed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. AT the &s;ame time, the whole body &s;hould be rubbed with the hand, or with hot woolen cloths. The rubbing &s;hould be mo|dearte, but continued with indu&s;try a long time, and particularly about the brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">V. DURING this time, a large quantity of a&s;hes, or &s;alt, or &s;and, &s;hould be heated; and as &s;oon as it is milk-warm, the body &s;hould be placed in it; the blowing and rubbing are then to be continued as before; and when the
<PB N="9" REF="021159_0008_0FB24DD38C0EAF68">a&s;hes, or &s;alt, are cooled, &s;ome warmer mu&s;t be added, &s;o that the whole may be kept milk|warm.</P>
<P>THESE methods &s;hould be continued three or four hours, as in &s;everal in&s;tances they have proved &s;ucce&s;sful, although no &s;igns of life appeared until that time. When the pa|tient is able to &s;wallow, he &s;hould take &s;ome wine, or rum and water; bleeding or purging ought not to be u&s;ed, without con&s;ulting a phy&s;ician, who &s;hould be called in as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>To prevent the</HI> fatal Effects <HI>of</HI> drinking cold Water, <HI>or</HI> cold Liquors <HI>of any Kind in</HI> warm Weather.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t, AVOID drinking while you are warm, or,</P>
<P N="2">2d, DRINK only a &s;mall quantity at once, and let it remain a &s;hort time in your mouth before you &s;wallow it; or,</P>
<P N="3">3d, WASH your hands and face, and rin&s;e your mouth with cold water before you drink. If the&s;e precautions have been neglected, and the di&s;order incident to drinking cold water hath been produced, the fir&s;t, and in mo&s;t in|&s;tances, the only remedy to be admini&s;tered, is &s;ixty drops of liquid laudanum in &s;pirit and water, or warm drink of any kind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021159_0009_0FB24DD551199FE0">
IF this &s;hould fail of giving relief, the &s;ame quantity may be given twenty minutes after|wards.</P>
<P>WHEN laudanum cannot be obtained, rum and water, or warm water &s;hould be given. Vomits and bleeding &s;hould not be u&s;ed with|out con&s;ulting a phy&s;ician.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> dangerous Effects <HI>of</HI> noxious Vapours, <HI>from</HI> Wells, Cellars, fermenting Liquors, <HI>&amp;c. may be</HI> prevented,</HEAD>
<P>BY procuring a free circulation of air, ei|ther by ventilators, or opening the doors or windows, where it is confined, or by changing the air, by keeping fires in the infected place, or by throwing in water, in which &s;tone-lime has been di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THESE precautions &s;hould be taken, before entering into &s;uch &s;u&s;pected places, or a light|ed candle &s;hould be fir&s;t introduced, which will go out, if the air is bad. When a per&s;on is let down into a well, he &s;hould be carefully watched, and drawn up again on the lea&s;t change. But when a per&s;on is apparently dead, from the above-mentioned cau&s;e, the fir&s;t thing to be done is to remove the body to a cool place in a whole&s;ome air; then let the body be &s;tripped, and let cold water be thrown from buckets over it for &s;ome time. This
<PB N="11" REF="021159_0010_0FB24DD6C2064F80">is particularly u&s;eful in ca&s;es of apparent death from drukenne&s;s.&mdash;Let the treatment now be the &s;ame as that for drowned per&s;ons. The head &s;hould be rai&s;ed a little; and con|tinued frictions, with blowing into the no&s;tril with a bellows, &s;hould be practi&s;ed for &s;everal hours.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>In</HI> Ca&s;es <HI>of</HI> Suffocation, <HI>from the</HI> Fumes <HI>of</HI> BURNING CHARCOAL,</HEAD>
<P>THE general treatment recommended for curing the di&s;orders brought on by noxious vapours, is to be applied; but the dangerous effects of this may be prevented, by taking care not to &s;it near it when burning; to burn it in a chimney; and where there is no chim|ney, to keep the door open, and to place a large tub of water in the room.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e, as well as in ca&s;es of drowned per&s;ons, moderate purges and bleeding are only to be u&s;ed, with the advice of a phy&s;i|cian.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>To prevent the</HI> fatal Effects <HI>of</HI> Lightning,</HEAD>
<P>LET your hou&s;e be provided with an iron conductor; but when this cannot be had, avoid &s;itting, or &s;tanding, near the window, door, or walls of an hou&s;e, during the time
<PB N="12" REF="021159_0011_0FB24DD83B47C418">of a thunder gu&s;t. The nearer you are placed to the middle of a room, the better. When you are not in an hou&s;e, avoid flying to the cover of the woods, or a &s;olitary tree, for &s;afety.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on is &s;truck by lightning, let continued frictions and inflations of the lungs be practi&s;ed: Let gentle &s;hocks of electricity be made to pa&s;s through the che&s;t, when a &s;kilful per&s;on can be procured to apply it; and let bli&s;ters be applied to the brea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>To prevent</HI> Danger <HI>from</HI> Expo&s;ure <HI>to the</HI> Exce&s;&s;ive Heat <HI>of the</HI> Sun.</HEAD>
<P>DISORDERS from this cau&s;e, or (as they are vulgarly termed) <HI>&s;trokes of the &s;un,</HI> may be expected, when a per&s;on who is expo&s;ed to his rays, is affected with a violent head|ach, attended with throbbing or with gid|dine&s;s; where the di&s;order takes place, the&s;e &s;ymptoms are followed by faintine&s;s and great in&s;en&s;ibility, with violent heat and drine&s;s of the &s;kin, redne&s;s and drine&s;s of the eyes, difficulty of breathing, and, according as the di&s;ea&s;e is more or le&s;s violent, with a difficulty, or entire inability of &s;peaking or moving.</P>
<P>TO guard again&s;t the&s;e dangerous effects of heat, it will be proper,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="021159_0012_0FB24DFE5B3FEFD8">
1&s;t, TO avoid labour, or violent exerci&s;e, or expo&s;ing your&s;elf to the rays of the &s;un, immediately after eating a hearty meal:</P>
<P N="2">2d, TO avoid drinking &s;pirits of any kind, when you are thus expo&s;ed. The&s;e add an internal fire to the heat of the &s;un, and are par|ticularly hurtful in harve&s;t. Vinegar and wa|ter, &s;weetened with mola&s;&s;es or brown &s;ugar, butter-milk and water, &s;mall beer, whey, or milk and water, are the mo&s;t proper drinks for people who are expo&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive heat. But the le&s;s a per&s;on drinks of liquors of any kind <HI>in the forenoon,</HI> the better will he endure the heat of a warm day. It will al&s;o be proper,</P>
<P N="3">3d, TO wear a white hat, or to cover a black one with white paper, when you are nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the hot &s;un, and to avoid &s;tanding &s;till when in &s;uch a &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="4">4th, TO retire into the &s;hade as &s;oon as you begin to be affected with pain or throbbing in the head, with giddine&s;s or with faintine&s;s.</P>
<P>If the&s;e precautions have been neglected, and the &s;ymptoms above de&s;cribed have come on, it will be proper,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, TO remove the per&s;on &s;o affected into a cool, dry place, and to loo&s;en all his garments, particularly tho&s;e around his neck and brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="021159_0013_0FB24DFF4F8F8540">
2d, TO examine whether the pul&s;e at the wri&s;ts or temples beats forcibly, and if it does, to bleed immediately; but if the pul&s;e be weak, or cannot be perceived, bleeding mu&s;t not be performed.</P>
<P N="3">3d, TO place his feet and legs (or if it can be done) the lower half of his body, in warm water. But if this remedy fails,</P>
<P N="4">4th, DR. Ti&s;&s;ot advi&s;es to apply linen cloths wet with cold water, or with cold water and vinegar, to the temples and all over the head.</P>
<P N="5">5th, TO admini&s;ter plentiful draughts of vinegar and water &s;weetened.</P>
<P>IN all ca&s;es of this kind, a phy&s;ician &s;hould be &s;ent for, unle&s;s the patient recovers &s;peedily.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>To prevent the</HI> Effects <HI>of</HI> exce&s;&s;ive Cold.</HEAD>
<P>Per&s;ons are in danger of being de&s;troyed by it, when they become very drow&s;y, or are affected with general numbne&s;s or in|&s;en&s;ibility of the body. As the cold which proves fatal, generally affects the feet fir&s;t, great care &s;hould be taken to keep them as warm as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="021159_0014_0FB24E025E6BA8A0">
1&s;t, BY protecting them when you are ex|po&s;ed to cold with wool, or woollen &s;ocks within the &s;hoes or boots, or with large wool|len &s;tockings drawn over them, or when you ride, with hay or &s;traw wrapped round them.</P>
<P N="2">2d, BY keeping up a bri&s;k circulation in the blood ve&s;&s;els of the feet, by <HI>moving them con|&s;tantly;</HI> or when this is impracticable, from a confined &s;ituation, and two or more per&s;ons are expo&s;ed together,</P>
<P N="3">3d, BY placing their feet, <HI>without &s;hoes,</HI> again&s;t each other's brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>IF notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, a per|&s;on &s;hould be rendered &s;leepy or in&s;en&s;ible by cold, he mu&s;t exert him&s;elf and move about quickly, for if he &s;hould &s;leep in the cold, he will inevitably peri&s;h. When a per&s;on who is travelling in company, begins to be affected in this manner, his companions &s;hould force him to walk bri&s;kly or to run.</P>
<P>WHEN cold has produced apparent death, the body &s;hould be placed in a room without fire, and rubbed &s;teadily with &s;now, or cloths wet with cold water, at the &s;ame time that the bellows is applied to the no&s;e, and u&s;ed as in the ca&s;e of drowning. This treatment &s;hould be continued a long time, although no &s;igns of life appear, for &s;ome per&s;ons have recover|ed,
<PB N="16" REF="021159_0015_0FB24E03B11E0D08">who were to appearance lifele&s;s for &s;e|veral hours.</P>
<P>When the limbs only are affected by cold, they &s;hould be rubbed gently with &s;now, or bathed in cold water with ice in it, until their feeling and power of motion returns; after which, the bathing or rubbing with &s;now is to be repeated once every hour, and continued a longer or &s;horter time, as the pains are more or le&s;s violent.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on thus affected &s;hould be kept from the fire, for warmth and acrid appli|cations of every kind are very injurious.</P>
