<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>DUE re&s;pect to great and good men, is doubtle&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with &s;upreme regard to truth. The late Reverend Pre|&s;ident Edwards, is remembered with great honor; but we ought not to be bia&s;ed in our judgment by partial favour. God accepteth no man's per&s;on. If his &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject before us were wrong, (as I believe they will appear to be) he does not now approve them, and would be well plea&s;ed to know they are di&s;approved, &s;o far as they are &s;o, by his brethren dwelling in the fle&s;h, and that right &s;entiments prevail. I have therefore no apprehen&s;ion of giving offence to him, or his com|panions, the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, by the pre&s;ent at|tempt, to &s;erve the intere&s;t of truth and virtue, by expo&s;ing the fal&s;hood of his peculiar notions. For I have no &s;ini&s;ter views in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>If what I have wrote in the following pages is &s;uch, as to commend it&s;elf to the acceptance of the wi&s;e and impartial, I am &s;atisfied, and can patiently endure the unju&s;t cen&s;ures of the unwi&s;e.&mdash;If any of the &s;ons of truth and virtue read the fol|lowing piece, I hope they will judge and treat it according to truth; and the writer as they would rea&s;onably de&s;ire to be treated them&s;elves. He a&s;ks no more.</P>
<P>I have aimed to tran&s;cribe enough to give the reader a true idea of the author's doctrine. If I have failed of this in any particular, it is without de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of Mr. Edwards's notion of the e&s;&s;ence or root of true virtue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. EDWARDS in his fir&s;t chapter gives us his idea of the e&s;&s;ence and root of all true virtue. By virtue he tolls us he means true holine&s;s or grace. This he calls the true, moral beauty of all moral beings. He &s;ays <Q><HI>True</HI> virtue <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence to being in general.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 117.</NOTE></Q> By being in general, he tells us he means <Q>intelligent beings in general, not inanimate be|ings that have no perception or will.&mdash;True virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts, not in love to any particular beings becau&s;e of their virtue or beauty; nor in gratitude, becau&s;e they love us,</Q> (therefore not in love to God as a being of infinite moral excellence, and love) <Q>but a propen&s;ity and union of heart to being, <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> exciting <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> benevolence to being <HI>in general.</HI>&mdash;I would expre&s;s what appears to me to be the truth on this &s;ubject, in the following particulars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> object of a virtuous benevolence is <HI>being, &s;imply</HI> con&s;idered: And if being &s;imply con&s;idered, be its object, then being <HI>in general</HI> is its object.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;econd object of a virtuous propen&s;ity of heart, is <HI>benevolent</HI> being.&mdash;A &s;econdary ground of <HI>pure</HI> be|nevolence, is virtuous benevolence it&s;elf, in its object. When any one under the influence of general benevo|lence, &s;ees another being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the like general benevolence, this attaches his heart to him, and draws forth greater love to him, than merely his having ex|i&s;tence&mdash;as
<PB N="4" REF="012067_0003_0F8994223395EAD8">it were out of gratitude to him for his love of general exi&s;tence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Several things noted&mdash;concerning this &s;econdary ground of a truly virtuous love. Fir&s;t, That loving a being on <HI>this ground</HI></Q> (as God for in&s;tance) <Q><HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> ari&s;es <HI>from</HI> pure benevolence to being <HI>in general,</HI> and <HI>comes to the &s;ame thing.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. This which has been mentioned as a &s;econdary ground of virtuous love, is the thing wherein <HI>true, mo|ral,</HI> or &s;piritual <HI>beauty primarily</HI> con&s;i&s;ts. Yea &s;piritual beauty con&s;i&s;ts <HI>wholly in this,</HI> and the various qualities and exerci&s;es of mind, which <HI>proceed from it;</HI> and the external actions which proceed from the&s;e. And in the&s;e things con&s;i&s;ts <HI>all true virtue.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. As all &s;piritual beauty lies in the&s;e principles and acts, &s;o 'tis <HI>primarily on this account,</HI> they are beautiful, viz. that they <HI>imply con&s;ent</HI> and <HI>union,</HI> with being <HI>in general.</HI> This is the <HI>primary</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> beauty of every thing that can ju&s;tly be called by the name virtue, or is any moral excellency.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. This &s;piritual beauty, that is but a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ground of a virtuous benevolence, is the <HI>primary</HI> ground of a truly virtuous <HI>complacence.</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 21&mdash;24.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Let us &s;top here a little, and make a few reflections on the doctrine before us.&mdash;The primary object of vir|tuous regard in pure benevolence, which true virtue or holine&s;s does <HI>radically</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;t, is being, <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> or regarded only as having perception and will, or intelligent being <HI>in general,</HI> ab&s;tractly con&s;i|dered. This primary object of virtuous regard, con&s;i|dered as &s;uch, has no per&s;onal, or moral, or relative cha|racters. It has but two attributes, perception and will. It is neither wi&s;e nor fooli&s;h, neither morally good nor evil, neither &s;elf-exi&s;tent nor created and dependent, nei|ther God nor a creature. It has no relation to the be|nevolent mind. It is mental being in general, <HI>&s;imply con|&s;idered, as &s;uch.</HI> The virtuous mind viewing of it <HI>as &s;uch,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="012067_0003_0F8994223395EAD8">unclothed with any other characters, per&s;onal or rela|tive, wi&s;hes away in the dark, that it may enjoy all the perfection, honor and happine&s;s it is capable of, be it what it will. <Q>All true virtue con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in this general benevolence; yea, it con&s;i&s;ts wholly in this, and in tho&s;e mental affections and actions which ari&s;e out of it.</Q> Does it &s;o indeed? Is this the <HI>root,</HI> out of which love to God, and all particular moral beings &s;prings? Are all particular virtues branches which &s;pring from this root? May all the&s;e be re&s;olved into this pure or &s;imple benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;i|dered, as their fir&s;t principle? It mu&s;t be &s;o, according to the doctrine before us. How different is this from that divine philo&s;ophy taught us from heaven!</P>
<P>According to this fundamental principle of Mr. Ed|wards's &s;cheme, God is not the primary object of virtuous regard, nor is love to him the root of virtuous affecti|ons. For God, and being &s;imply con&s;idered, are ex|ceeding divers from each other. Our author indeed &s;ometimes &s;ays, they are the &s;ame, in effect, and that be|nevolence to the one is, in effect, the &s;ame as love to the other. But in this he is totally incon&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf, and confounds his own fundamental doctrine. Of the love of complacence which ari&s;es out of benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, God may be the primary and chief object, con&s;i&s;tently with this &s;cheme; but of the love of virtuous benevolence he is, and can be but a &s;econdary object. Benevolence to God, a particular being, is but a &s;econdary virtue, or particular great branch of benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered. For <Q>true virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts not in love to any particular beings <HI>as virtuous</HI></Q> (&s;o not to God) <Q>but in a propen&s;ity and union of heart to being, &s;imply con&s;i|dered, exciting ab&s;olute benevolence to being in ge|neral.</Q></P>
<P>According to this doctrine, there ought to have been <HI>three</HI> great commands. The fir&s;t, greate&s;t, and mo&s;t fundamental of all &s;hould have been this, viz. <Q>Thou
<PB N="6" REF="012067_0004_0F899422F6B088B8">&s;halt love being in general, &s;imply con&s;idered as having perception and will: for &s;imple benevolence to this is the root and mother of all particular virtues; and all moral excellence and &s;piritual beauty primarily and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in it.'&mdash;Secondly, 'Subordi|nate to this, and as the fir&s;t great branch of this root, Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. And thirdly, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q> But on the two la&s;t <Q>hang all the law and the pro|phets.</Q> The fir&s;t is wholly overlooked. A &s;trange over&s;ight, if all true virtue, or holine&s;s and grace, pri|marily, radically, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in it!</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, perhaps, unwilling to give up Mr. Edwards's doctrine, will &s;ay, 'The&s;e two commands im|ply, the fir&s;t, as containing the whole of mental being.' This is no an&s;wer to the objection. According to this notion of the root, or fir&s;t principle of true virtue, love to God, as well as to our neighbour, is the offspring of this general, indeterminate benevolence. And if it is fit to command or require the daughter affection, much more the mother love. And be&s;ides, Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, to love the Lord our God, is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>greate&s;t</HI> com|mand in the law. He has given no intimation of his knowing any thing of this hidden root, and &s;pring of all virtue. And the holy prophets and apo&s;tles knew no|thing of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How &s;upreme love to God re&s;ults from ab&s;olute be|nevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, and is in ef|fect the &s;ame thing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. Edwards begins his &s;econd chapter thus, <Q>From what has been &s;aid, 'tis evident, that true vir|tue mu&s;t chiefly con&s;i&s;t in love to God.&mdash;This ap|pears whether we con&s;ider the primary or &s;econdary ground of virtuous love.</Q></P>
<P>1&s;t. <Q>It was ob&s;erved that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> objective ground
<PB N="7" REF="012067_0004_0F899422F6B088B8">of that love wherein true virtue con&s;i&s;ts, is being &s;imp|ly con&s;idered; and as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this, that being who has the mo&s;t of being, has proportion|ably the greate&s;t &s;hare of virtuous benevolence,</Q> being known as &s;uch. <Q>But God has infinitely the greate&s;t &s;hare of exi&s;tence, or is infinitely the greate&s;t being. So that all other beings&mdash;is as nothing in compari&s;on of him.</Q> According to our author, <Q>True virtue pri|marily and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in pure benevo|lence to being in general: Yea it wholly con&s;i&s;ts in this and tho&s;e affections and actions that ari&s;e out of it.</Q> If &s;o, virtue mu&s;t <HI>chiefly</HI> con&s;i&s;t in love to being in general. And this general benevolence mu&s;t, in the order of nature, at lea&s;t, be conceived of, as antecedent to any truly virtuous regard to any particular being whatever: for &s;uch are regarded with benevolence, <HI>pri|marily,</HI> as having a &s;hare in general being.</P>
<P>Upon Mr. Edwards's principles the ab&s;olutely great Being, mu&s;t have an incomparably greater &s;hare of the primary benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, than all other particular beings. Compared with them he has chief and &s;upreme benevolent regard: but not &s;o, com|pared with the primary object of virtuous love, viz. Be|ing in general. That mu&s;t be the chief object; for the great Being does not exhau&s;t all being, &s;o as to reduce all others to non-exi&s;tence, or no degree of being. He infinitely outweighs all other beings, as put into the &s;cale again&s;t him. But if his infinite degree of being is put into one &s;cale, and the &s;ame be put into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and together with that the degrees of exi&s;tence of all other beings, 'tis obvious this great Being's weight in the oppo&s;ite &s;cales will balance it&s;elf, and the whole weight of the other beings will remain clear, and turn the &s;cale. This &s;cale has in it the whole of the primary object of virtuous love, the other not; and the virtuous attraction, or tendency of primary benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, is in proportion to the quantity of being.&mdash;How do fal&s;e metaphi&s;icks entangle and mi&s;lead
<PB N="8" REF="012067_0005_0F899423B3F34930">the greate&s;t and be&s;t men, when they wander in them! It is as dengerous a thing to attempt to be wi&s;e over|much, as to be overmuch righteous.</P>
<P>But let us attend to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing mentioned by our author, as an evidence that true virtue does, upon his fir&s;t principle, con&s;i&s;t <HI>chiefly</HI> in love to God. <Q>If we con&s;ider the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ground of love, viz. Beauty or moral excellency, the &s;ame thing will appear.</Q> viz. That virtue chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the love of God: <Q>for God is infinitely the mo&s;t beautiful and excellent being, as well as the greate&s;t. Therefore he that has true vir|tue con&s;i&s;ting</Q> (primarily, radically and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential|ly) 'in benevolence to being in general, and' (&s;econda|rily) <Q>in complacence in virtue, and benevolence to virtuous being, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a &s;upreme love to God, both of benevolence and complacence.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</NOTE></Q> Our author &s;ays, as quoted above, <Q>a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ground of pure benevolence is virtuous benevolence it &s;elf, in its object.&mdash;And loving a being on <HI>this ground,</HI> nece&s;&s;ari|ly <HI>ari&s;es from</HI> pure benevolence to being in general &amp; comes to <HI>the &s;ame thing.</HI></Q> From the&s;e principles it ne|ce&s;&s;arily follows, that love to God, both of benevolence and complacence, con&s;idered as having infinitely the highe&s;t benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, is but a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> and <HI>daughter</HI> virtue. The mother virtue is de|mon&s;trably no other than pure benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered. God, as mo&s;t benevolent to being in general, is the fir&s;t object of virtue's <HI>&s;econdary</HI> love: Being &s;imply con&s;idered, has the fir&s;t and &s;upreme re|gard. For it can't be that the daughter love, &s;hould u&s;urp the place and honor of the mother, or that the &s;tream &s;hould be prefered before, and be greater than the fountain.</P>
<P>Indeed God is, upon the&s;e principles, the chief and &s;upreme object of virtuous <HI>complacence.</HI> But &s;uch com|placence is it&s;elf the offspring of benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, and may be re&s;olved into it. <Q>He
<PB N="9" REF="012067_0005_0F899423B3F34930">that is governed by love to being in general, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have complacence in him, who he &s;ees has the &s;ame benevolence, and the greater degree of bene|volence to him, as it were <HI>out of gratitude</HI> to him, for his love to general exi&s;tence, that his own heart is unit|ed to, and &s;o looks on its intere&s;t as its own.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 123.</NOTE></P>
<P>Can the&s;e things be right? Is true, religious love to God &s;uch as Mr. Edwards here repre&s;ents it? Does the virtuous or holy mind fir&s;t entertain a benevolent af|fection for being in general, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, &s;imp|ly as intelligent, and in the next &s;tep direct this benevo|lence chiefly to God, con&s;idering him as having the greate&s;t &s;hare of mental being? and thus viewing him as mo&s;t benevolent and beneficent to being &s;imply con|&s;idered, does the benevolent mind ri&s;e in greater bene|volence to him, and &s;ettle in complacence in him, on this account, from a &s;ort of gratitude to him, as thus be|friending the grand object of his primary love? Does not this repre&s;ent being &s;imply con&s;idered as the &s;upreme object of virtuous regard, and make it an idol, and vir|tue it&s;elf idolatrous? Does it not in effect repre&s;ent love to God, as the re&s;ult of our own virtuous love to &s;imple being, virtue's idol, rather than of his virtuous attracti|on, and quickening love to us while we were &s;inners? Do we receive any &s;uch ideas from in&s;pired teachers in holy &s;cripture?&mdash;The&s;e views are too &s;hocking. Mr. Edwards could not admit them in open light, tho' his doctrine leads to them; but often turns off his eye, &amp; relieves both him&s;elf and his reader, by giving a truer view of love to God. I wi&s;h he had been uniform in this: But he is very incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf. I believe it is not po&s;&s;ible for &s;o great and good a man as he was, building on &s;o fal&s;e a foundation, to be &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent throughout.&mdash;He &s;ays, <Q><HI>All true virtue&punc;</HI> mu&s;t <HI>radically,</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;t in a &s;upreme love to God, both of
<PB N="10" REF="012067_0006_0F89942473EA0618"><HI>benevolence</HI> and complacence.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I here pre&s;ent the reader with a remark of an ingenious Gentle|man, in a letter to me, which I think is very ju&s;t. <Q>Mr. Edwards's unu&s;ual, improper manner of u&s;ing the word <HI>benevolence</HI> is worthy, I &s;hould think, of being particularly noticed. To &s;ay a &s;ubject, a pea&s;ant, a poor beggar &s;hould exerci&s;e benevolence towards his Prince, that a child &s;hould be benevolent to his father, &amp;c. &s;ounds very odd; but to denominate that regard which an intelligent creature owes to that Being, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es independently an inexhau&s;table fullne&s;s, and who is the creator and father of all living, to deno|minate the regard we owe to this Being, <HI>benevolence,</HI> is more than odd; it is quite improper, and &s;ounds irreverent. Nor will it &s;uf|fice to &s;ay (as Mr. Edwards's admirers have &s;aid) that a man may u&s;e any word he plea&s;es, provided he a&s;certains the &s;en&s;e in which he u&s;es it: For by that rule the mo&s;t familiar or vulgar, yea, and profane expre&s;&s;ions might be u&s;ed concerning the ble&s;&s;ed God, with innocence.</Q>&mdash;I think Mr. Edwards has greatly deba&s;ed the idea &amp; character of that reverent love we owe to the great God, in his account of the root and progre&s;s of love to him, as above. In truth he has changed the nature of virtue and piety, as will more fully appear in the &s;equal.</NOTE> And yet he lays it down as his fundamental principle, <Q>that true virtue <HI>mo&s;t</HI> e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence to being in ge|neral; the fir&s;t object of a virtuous benevolence, or of virtuous love is being <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered.</Q> Being <HI>in ge|neral,</HI> or <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered is not God: It has none of the peculiar, di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of the Godhead. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that virtue &s;hould primarily, radically &amp; mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t both in love to God, and to being &s;imply con&s;idered, unle&s;s it may thus con&s;i&s;t in love to two very different objects, God, and a mere ab&s;tract idea, a creature of the mind. Our worthy author al&s;o &s;ays, <Q>Being in general&mdash;is by right the great, &s;upreme, rul|ing and ab&s;olutely &s;overeign object of our regard.</Q> (p. 30.) This is not God. He is one only, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all other beings in the univer&s;e, who are almo&s;t infinite in number and weight. But he &s;oon comes about right again, and &s;ays, <Q>A truly virtuous mind is under the &s;overeign dominion of love to God.</Q> (p. 133)&mdash;<Q>It may be a&s;&s;erted in general, that nothing is of the nature of <HI>true</HI> virtue, in which God is not the
<PB N="11" REF="012067_0006_0F89942473EA0618"><HI>fir&s;t</HI> and the la&s;t; or which, with regard to their ex|erci&s;es in general, have not their <HI>fir&s;t foundation</HI> and <HI>&s;ource</HI> in apprehen&s;ions of God's &s;upreme dignity and glory, and in an&s;werable e&s;teem and love to him, and have not re&s;pect to God as their &s;upreme end.</Q> (p. 134)</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t true. And yet it is &s;aid, <Q>true virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts not in love to any particular beings, becau&s;e of their virtue,&mdash;but in propen&s;ity and union of heart, to being <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered.</Q></P>
<P>Let us carefully gather up the &s;cattered wheat, and let the wind drive the chaff away.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards pre&s;ents us with three grand objects of virtue's primary and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential regard, viz. Being in general, con&s;idered &s;imply, as intelligent, uncloathed with any per&s;onal, moral or relative characters; the uni|ver&s;al &s;y&s;tem of intelligent beings, and God the author of being, and head of the &s;y&s;tem; and &s;ays, the&s;e are in effect one: and primary and chief regard to being in general, &s;imply con&s;idered, to the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of beings, and to God the Being of beings, and head of the &s;y&s;tem, is repre&s;ented as, in effect, the &s;ame thing. But each of the&s;e objects has peculiar characters, which give ground for di&s;tingui&s;hing ideas: Our author does often di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other, and they ought never to be confounded. There can't be three <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;upreme</HI> objects of virtuous love.</P>
<P>There is indeed a &s;trange confu&s;ion and incon&s;i&s;tence in this great man's ideas and rea&s;onings upon this &s;ub|ject.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Concerning Mr. Edwards's notions of the primary and &s;econdary beauty of moral things.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. Edwards, in his third chapter, &s;ays many things concerning what he calls the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty of moral beings and actions, which are very ex|traordinary, and I think, very injurous and de&s;tructive to true virtue.&mdash;I mu&s;t make &s;ome extracts that the rea|der may be under advantage to judge of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remarks.</P>

'Tho' that which has been &s;poken of,' viz. benevo|lence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, &amp;c. <Q><HI>alone</HI> is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the true beauty of moral agents,&mdash;and <HI>alone</HI> is the moral amiablene&s;s of beings that have under|&s;tanding and will, in the eyes of him that perfectly &s;ees all things as they are: Yet there are other quali|ties, &s;en&s;ations, propen&s;ities and affections of mind, &amp; principles of action, that often obtain the epithet of <HI>virtuous,</HI> and by many are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the nature of true virtue; which are intirely of a di&s;tinct nature from this, and have nothing of that kind. (p. 134.)</Q></P>
<P><Q>The propen&s;ity of minds to mental exi&s;tence may be called the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> and <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or primary beauty, being the proper and peculiar beauty of moral beings.&mdash;Yet there is another, <HI>inferior, &s;econdary</HI> beauty, which is not peculiar to &s;piritual beings, but is found even in in|animate things; which con&s;i&s;ts in a mutual con&s;ent and agreement of different things in form, manner, quantity, and vi&s;ible end and de&s;ign; called by the various names of regularity, order, uniformity, &s;yme|try, proportion, harmony, &amp;c. &s;uch is the mutual a|greement of the &s;ides of a &s;quare&mdash;of the colours, fi|gures, dimen&s;ions and di&s;tances of the different &s;pots on a che&s;s-board&mdash;of the figures of a piece of chints, or brocade. Such is the beautiful proportion of the various parts of a human countenance. And &s;uch is the &s;weet mutual con&s;ent and agreement of the vari|ous notes of a melodious tune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This &s;econdary beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in uniformity &amp; proportion, not only takes place in material things, but in things <HI>immaterial.</HI>&mdash;This is evident in fact in num|berle&s;s in&s;tances.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is a beauty in the virtue called <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in the agreement of different things that have relation to one another, in nature, manner, and mea|&s;ure: And therefore is the <HI>very &s;ame &s;ort</HI> of beauty with that uniformity and proportion, which is ob&s;erv|able
<PB N="14" REF="012067_0008_0F899425F5B3E108">in tho&s;e <HI>material</HI> things which are e&s;teemed beau|tiful;</Q> (with that of a <HI>che&s;s-board</HI> for in&s;tance.)</P>
<P><Q>Things are in natural regularity and mutual agree|ment, when he who&s;e heart oppo&s;es the univer&s;al &s;y&s;|tem &s;hould have, (has) the hearts of the &s;y&s;tem or&mdash; of the head of the &s;y&s;tem again&s;t him, and that in con|&s;equence he &s;hould (does) receive evil in proportion to the evil tendency of the oppo&s;ition of his heart.&mdash; So there is a like agreement in nature and mea&s;ure when he that loves has the proper returns of love:&mdash; as there is a kind of ju&s;tice in a becoming gratitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed mo&s;t of the duties incumbent on us, partake of the nature of ju&s;tice. There is &s;ome natural agree|ment of one thing to another; &s;ome adaptedne&s;s of the agent to the object; &s;ome an&s;werablene&s;s of the act to the occa&s;ion; &s;ome equality and proportion in things of a &s;imilar nature and direct relation one to another.</Q> (Or, to &s;peak more properly and intelligi|bly; from the various characters, relations and con|nections of moral beings, there ari&s;es a natural and <HI>moral</HI> fitne&s;s, &s;uitablene&s;s and equity in &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions, af|fections and actions of one towards another, and a like unfitne&s;s, un&s;uitablene&s;s, and inequitablene&s;s in others. But this, tho' the cleare&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t manner of expre&s;&s;|ing the matter, does not &s;o well agree with the favorite &s;cheme of reducing all moral fitne&s;&s;es of relative virtues into the order of <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauties, and of repre&s;enting their beauty as altogether of the <HI>&s;ame &s;ort</HI> with that of a beautiful face, and &s;o as having nothing of the <HI>nature</HI> of <HI>true</HI> virtue in them &s;imply <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> and therefore this is carefully avoided, and &s;uch a manner of expre&s;&s;ion is cho&s;en, as is more applicable to the beautiful harmony of parts in material things.

<P><Q>It is this <HI>&s;econdary</HI> kind of beauty, which belongs to the virtues and duties required of us, that Mr. Wal|la&s;ton &s;eems to have had in his eye, when he re&s;olved all virtue into an agreement of inclinations, volitions and actions with truth.

<P><Q>But there is another and <HI>higher</HI> beauty in <HI>true</HI> virtue, and in <HI>all truly virtuous</HI> di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es, than what con&s;i&s;ts in any uniformity or &s;imilarity of various things</Q> (or in the moral fitne&s;s and equitablene&s;s of the di&s;po&s;itions and actions of moral beings towards each other) <Q>viz. the union of heart to being <HI>in general,</HI> which appears in tho&s;e virtues; and which, tho&s;e virtues <HI>when true,</HI> are the various <HI>expre&s;&s;ions of.</HI> Benevolence to be|ing

<P>Enough, I pre&s;ume, has been quoted on this head to give the reader a clear idea of this great man's notions concerning what he calls the only true moral beauty, of moral beings, in which he places the e&s;&s;ence of true vir|tue; and what he calls the inferior, &s;econdary beauty, in which, he &s;ays, virtue does not con&s;i&s;t, any more than in a harmonious tune.&mdash;Let us now examine them a little. But their fal&s;hood and ab&s;urdity are &s;o open and glaring, that it is difficult to &s;ay any thing to render it more &s;triking. However we may view this doctrine in various lights, and ob&s;erve &s;ome of its con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="1">1. If this doctrine is true, God's revealed law, which is profe&s;&s;edly the guide to true virtue, the rule and &s;tand|ard of it, no where commands, recommends, or once mentions that <HI>in which</HI> all <HI>true</HI> virtue <HI>primarily</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts;</HI> but only injoins and recommends it in regard to its &s;econdary beauty.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, Mr. Edwards does implicitly ac|knowledge this in what has been tran&s;cribed above.&mdash; Now certainly, that the law and &s;tandard of true virtue &s;hould take no notice of that in which it does mo&s;t e&s;|&s;entially con&s;i&s;t, is a more wonderful my&s;tery than any of tho&s;e that belong to revealed religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this doctrine is true, it may be &s;u&s;pected, that the holy and in&s;pired men of old, prophets and apo&s;tles, never knew or practi&s;ed true virtue. Whenever they re|commend tho&s;e works or actions which are virtuous, they do it by repre&s;enting their &s;econdary beauty, in which virtue does not con&s;i&s;t, any more than in the beauty of a &s;quare.&mdash;When they prai&s;e and honor the virtues of God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in their rapturous de|votions, they dwell upon their relative a&s;pects, and in|ferior
<PB N="17" REF="012067_0009_0F899426B400E978">beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in mental proportion and har|mony, and are profoundly &s;ilent about their primary, &amp; only true moral beauty. They don't '<HI>go to the bottom of things,</HI>' and lay open their root and fir&s;t &s;pring. Proba|bly they knew nothing of it. Thus David prai&s;es God, &s;aying, <Q>The Lord rewarded me according as I did a|right&mdash;With the pure and upright thou wilt &s;hew thy &s;elf pure and upright: With the froward, thou wilt &s;hew thy&s;elf froward.</Q> He is here prai&s;ing God for the proportion and agreement of his works with their objects and occa&s;ions, which is not the thing in which their virtuou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;Indeed he &s;ays, God's tender mercies are over all the works of his hands; and the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, he is the father of the whole family of hea|ven and earth: Which perhaps may be thought by &s;ome, to refer to the fir&s;t principle of all true virtue, viz. Pure benevolence to being <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered.</HI> But it is ob&s;erv|able that they put more into the character of the&s;e ob|jects of God's paternal care, and tender mercies, than be|longs to being &s;imply con&s;idered, or as only having per|ception and will. They are thus regarded, as being the works of his hands, and members of his family. They are therefore, <HI>relatively con&s;idered,</HI> objects of God's benevo|lent, paternal regard: And in this view of them there is a natural &s;uitablene&s;s, and a kind of ju&s;tice in their be|ing &s;o regarded. This is an inferior kind of beauty, not virtuous in it&s;elf, but only as this paternal, tender care for his <HI>own</HI> creatures, ari&s;es out of pure benevolence to being, <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered. Is it indeed &s;o?</P>
<P>Moreover, the angels of God, and the whole church in heaven, appear to take as little notice of the primary and only true moral beauty, as the prophets and apo&s;|tles have done. In their &s;ongs of prai&s;e to God and the Lamb, they dwell upon the &s;econdary beauty of their vir|tuous works, and are in raptures in their contemplations of it. <Q>Thou art righteous, O Lord,&mdash;becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judged thus: for they have &s;hed the blood of &s;aints and prophets, and thou ha&s;t given them blood to

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 16.5, 6.</NOTE></Q> It is the beauty of God's judgment, as righteous or ju&s;t, <Q>con&s;i&s;ting in the a|greement, and harmonious proportion of different things, that have relation to one another, in nature, manner and mea&s;ure,</Q> that is here prai&s;ed; but this is <Q>the very &s;ame <HI>&s;ort</HI> of beauty with that uniformity and proportion which is ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e material things which are e&s;teemed beautiful.</Q> Why did not the an|gel of the waters, on this great occa&s;ion, take notice of that fir&s;t &s;pring, benevolence to &s;imple being, which in|fluenced this judgment, and <HI>&s;anctified</HI> the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of it, and rai&s;ed it into virtue, and gave it the lu&s;tre of the primary and only true moral beauty? Doubtle&s;s he tho't its virtuou&s;ne&s;s and true beauty con&s;i&s;ted in its righteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis al&s;o ob&s;ervable that the wi&s;e&s;t and holie&s;t men in the church, thro' all ages, have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in their writings, and books of devotion, as &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty of virtuous affections and actions was their <HI>true</HI> beauty. That it is not &s;o, but only an inferior kind of beauty, like that of bodies, is a <HI>new</HI> di&s;covery, re&s;erved for our age and country. But it is more probable that one truly great and good man &s;hould have unhappily rea&s;oned him&s;elf into &s;peculative error, than that the whole church in heaven and earth &s;hould, till now, have overlooked the primary and only true mo|ral beauty and excellence of moral beings.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let it al&s;o be ob&s;erved that there is no &s;uch object of God's attention and regard, as being <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered.</HI> God is his own fir&s;t object. He &s;ees him&s;elf as he is, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ab&s;olute fullne&s;s of being, enriched and adorned with all po&s;&s;ible mental perfections. As &s;uch he is the primary object of his fir&s;t and chief love, both of benevolence and complacence. How ridiculous would it be to repre&s;ent him, as fir&s;t viewing him&s;elf, as po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of infinite degrees of being, &s;imply con&s;idered, and in this view exerci&s;ing primary, pure benevolence to him|&s;elf; and then reflecting on him&s;elf as thus virtuou&s;ly
<PB N="19" REF="012067_0010_0F8994277579F100">benevolent, making him&s;elf, as &s;uch, the &s;econdary ob|ject of greater benevolence, and the fir&s;t object of his own complacence? Yet &s;o it mu&s;t be, upon this &s;cheme.</P>
<P>All other mental being, whether future or actually exi&s;ting, is &s;een by God, as &s;hared in various proportions among a great number of di&s;tinct beings, and the&s;e are all regarded as <HI>his creatures</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> made for certain valuable ends. <HI>As &s;uch</HI> they are objects of his paternal benevolence and care, in various degrees, wi&s;ely and e|quitably proportioned to the various importance of their re&s;pective being, and de&s;tined u&s;e and end.</P>
<P>What now is become of being &s;imply con&s;idered, the grand, primary object of virtuous love? It is vani&s;hed as a &s;hadow, or a night vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us next con&s;ider the de&s;tructive influence of this notion of virtue, upon virtue it&s;elf. All relative duties which we owe to God, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our fellow &s;ervants, in all our various relations to them, and connections with them, partake of the nature of ju&s;tice: they are equitable, fit and right in their own nature: they have a natural agreement and harmonious propor|tionablene&s;s to the nature and characters of their re&s;pec|tive objects, as compared with our own, and to the re|lations and connections between the agent and the ob|jects of the&s;e duties. All this you &s;ee and approve, &amp; the di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of your mind or heart to|wards all the objects of the&s;e relative duties, are natural, harmoniou&s;ly proportionable to them, and in concord with them, equitably &s;uited to them. Your heart then is very beautiful, but not at all virtuous, if the&s;e harmo|nious and equitable di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of your mind do not ari&s;e from pure benevolence to being, &s;imp|ly con&s;idered, <Q>which is the true and moral beauty of beings that have under&s;tanding.</Q> So then the beauty of your mind as adorned with all the&s;e relative, equita|ble and harmonious di&s;po&s;itions <HI>only,</HI> is of the &s;ame &s;ort with that of bodies. Your heart is as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">tiful as a &s;quare or a cube, and no more virtuous than they. <Q>'Tis
<PB N="20" REF="012067_0011_0F89942835380600">true that benevolence to being in general, when a per|&s;on hath it, will naturally incline him to ju&s;tice or pro|portion in the exerci&s;e of it to particular beings.</Q>&mdash; But then, as Mr. Edwards adds. <Q>It appears that <HI>ju&s;t</HI> affections and acts have a beauty in them <HI>di&s;tinct from,</HI> and &s;uperior to the uniformity and equality there is in them;&mdash;and that is the expre&s;&s;ion and manife&s;tation there is in them of benevolence to being in general.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 142, 143.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Edwards &s;ums up the matter thus, <Q>From all that has been ob&s;erved concerning this <HI>&s;econdary</HI> kind of beauty, it appears that, <HI>that</HI> di&s;po&s;ition or &s;en&s;e of the mind which con&s;i&s;ts in a determination of mind to approve and be plea&s;ed with this beauty, con&s;idered &s;imply and by it&s;elf, has <HI>nothing</HI> of the nature of true virtue, and is <HI>intirely</HI> a different thing from a truly vir|tuous ta&s;te. For it has been &s;hewn that this kind of beauty is <HI>intirely diver&s;e</HI> from the beauty of true virtue. And therefore it will follow that a ta&s;te for this kind of beauty, is intirely a different thing from a ta&s;te of true virtue. Who will affirm that a di&s;po&s;ition to ap|prove the harmony of good mu&s;ic, or the beauty of a &s;quare, is the &s;ame with true holine&s;s, or a truly virtu|ous di&s;po&s;ition of mind?</Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">p. 143.</NOTE> No man, I pre&s;ume, ever will. But if &s;ome one &s;hould, he would not talk more ab&s;urdly than this great and worthy gentleman does, when he reduces moral harmony, and ju&s;t proportion to a beauty or excellence of the '<HI>very &s;ame &s;ort</HI>' with that of mu&s;ic or a &s;quare.</P>
<P>If this good man had attended to one obvious di&s;tinc|tion he might have &s;aved him&s;elf from falling into this grand ab&s;urdity, viz. The difference there is, in the na|ture of the things, between the mind's &s;eeing and ap|proving the harmonious proportion and ju&s;tne&s;s of vir|tuous di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of heart, towards God &amp; our neighbour, and having &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and exer|ci&s;es him&s;elf. A man may &s;ee and approve the beauty and excellence of virtue, in &s;ome degree, and yet his heart not be in this beautifully harmonious and equitable
<PB N="21" REF="012067_0011_0F89942835380600">temper and &s;tate. Nothing is more common, and no|thing more to be lamented, than this mon&s;trous incon&s;i&s;t|ence between the moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te of the mind, and the ruling di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of the heart of man.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards concludes this chapter with this ob&s;er|vation, which clo&s;es the proof of his doctrine, <Q>Not only rea&s;on, but experience plainly &s;hews, that men's approbation of this &s;ort of beauty</Q> (the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty of moral beings and actions) <Q>does not &s;pring from any virtuous temper, and has <HI>no connection</HI> with virtue. For otherwi&s;e men's <HI>delight</HI> in the beauty of <HI>&s;quares, cubes,</HI> and regular polygons, and the beautiful figures in a piece of embroidery, would increa&s;e in proportion to men's virtue; and would be rai&s;ed to a great height in &s;ome eminently virtuous and holy men.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 144.</NOTE> Wonderful! Here an appeal is made to experience, and the argument is built on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that moral proportion and harmony is a beauty of the &s;ame kind with that of ma|terial things. It is not po&s;&s;ible to conceive any thing more ab&s;urd. I de&s;ire any one to take a human mind, adorned with all right, relative affections and exerci&s;es to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, harmoniou&s;ly agreable, and beautifully pro|portioned to his characters and relations to us, (only ex|cluding benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, and let the faith of him be their &s;pring) and carefully compare it with a &s;quare, a cube, and a beautiful piece of em|broidery, and try if he can di&s;cover any &s;uch likene&s;s in their beauties as to lead him to pronounce them 'beau|ties of the very &s;ame &s;ort' or order. He will as &s;oon di&s;|cover the actions of a &s;pirit to be of the &s;ame kind with the action or motions of a clock.</P>

The tendency of objects to excite that degree of benevolence, which is proportionable to the degree of being, &amp;c. is the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of benevolence, and <HI>not the ground</HI> of it. Even as a ten|dency of bodies one to another, by mutual attraction, in proportion to the quantity of matter, is the con&s;e|quence of the being of &s;uch a thing as attraction, and not attraction the effect of proportion.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>According to this doctrine the nature and character, or perfecti|ons of God, are <HI>no cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>ground</HI> of the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of a virtuous or holy principle in the hearts of created, intelligent beings.

This has no po&s;&s;ible influence in fir&s;t rai&s;ing the virtuous principle in the mind, but only in giving it a chief direction and ten|dency to God, after it does exi&s;t. This is the &s;ame ab&s;urdity in mo|ral philo&s;ophy, as it would be in natural, to affirm that a load&s;tone can't attract iron towards it&s;elf, till that is fir&s;t endowed with a peculi|ar attracting tendency to &s;tones in general, &s;imply con&s;idered as &s;tone.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know how the general attraction or propen&s;ity of mind to being, comes into exi&s;tence. Nothing in its object, no influence from any quantity of being, or virtuous attraction of any being upon the mind, is the cau&s;e or ground of it; and it is confe&s;&s;ed not to be natural to man, and that no po&s;&s;ible exertion of our minds can give it being. It mu&s;t then be a preternatural, blind in&s;tict, which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can give no account of, and a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Edwards is e&s;teemed a great ma&s;ter of <HI>metaphi&s;ical</HI> rea&s;on|ing; and his followers &s;eem to value them&s;elves for their &s;kill in it, and to imagine they <HI>demon&s;trate</HI> their doctrines to be true. Many o|thers, clearly &s;eeing their notions are fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, cry out again&s;t metaphi&s;ical rea&s;oning as uncertain, and rather adapted to ob&s;cure &amp; perplex things, than to di&s;cover and vindicate truth. Both &s;ides, I think, are mi&s;taken. Well connected rea&s;onings, built on the known natures of things, are &s;ure, and their re&s;ult true. But the common fault is, that men &s;ub&s;titute fal&s;e metaphi&s;icks for true. They imagine things different in their nature from what they really are; and rea|&s;oning on this fal&s;e ground, tho' the intermediate links in their chain are well connected, yet their rea&s;onings conclude wrong, and land them in glaring fal&s;hood and ab&s;urdity. If the fir&s;t principles are fal&s;e and imaginary, and the rea&s;oning upon them is ju&s;t, the conclu|&s;ion will nece&s;&s;arily be wrong: And thus by mi&s;repre&s;enting the true nature of the things on which the rea&s;onings are founded, &s;y&s;tems of error are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;eemingly ju&s;t rea&s;onings end in the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities.&mdash;Thus Dr. Clark, with many other great men, imagin|ing the pre&s;ence and exten&s;ion of &s;pirits analogous to that of bodies, and rea&s;oning on this ground, concerning the immen&s;ity of the divine Being, involves him&s;elf in inextricable perplexities. Thus al&s;o Mr. Edwards fir&s;t gives virtue an imaginary nature and e&s;&s;ence or root; and then rea&s;oning ju&s;tly on this &s;alfe foundation involves him&s;elf in many grand ab&s;urdities, and confounds the nature of virtue and vice, and changes God's moral government into an ab&s;urd tyranny. This is not true, metaphi&s;ical, but imaginary and arbitrary rea&s;oning.&mdash;This great man's &s;cheme and rea&s;onings concerning the freedom of the will, have a like imaginary foundation, and end in evident fal&s;hoods, and mo&s;t de&s;tructive errors. This worthy Gentleman has been very unhappy in &s;undry other matters, in mi&s;taking the nature of things, and &s;ub&s;tituting imaginations for realities, and building upon them, and admitting their con&s;equences, as tho' they were a &s;ure foundation. And too many of his admirers are unhappily caught in the &s;ame &s;nare. They &s;eem to rea&s;on with clearne&s;s and &s;trength, and look down with a &s;ort of contemptuous pity on tho&s;e who are not convinced by them, as weak or blind; but their foundation principles are fal&s;e; they mi&s;|take the nature of things, feign it to be another thing than it really is. When the root of our rea&s;onings is as rottenne&s;s, the blo&s;&s;om will go up as du&s;t. The only way in which tho&s;e who are thus entangled in the labyrinth of fal&s;e metaphi&s;icks, can di&s;ingage them&s;elves, is by carefully examining their foundation principles, and learning to take their ideas of the nature of things from the things them&s;elves as they really are, and not &s;uffer their minds to be impe&s;ed on by an imagi|nary and arbitrary mi&s;repre&s;entation of their nature.

<P>I Pa&s;s over Mr. Edwards's fourth chapter, in which he treats of &s;elf-love, as little to my purpo&s;e: But in the fifth, wherein he treats of natural con&s;cience, and

<P><Q>1.|In&mdash;that di&s;po&s;ition to approve or di&s;approve the moral treatment which pa&s;&s;es between us and others, from a determination of the mind, to be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> or <HI>unea&s;y,</HI> in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our being <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> or <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves.</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 162.</NOTE></Q> This gives no idea at all of the nature and true character of con&s;cience. That determines us to be ea&s;y or unea&s;y in reflecting on our own moral con|duct, as we judge it to be con&s;i&s;tent or incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>law of God,</HI> and &s;o to de&s;erve approbation or blame from him. If our tho'ts look no further than to <HI>&s;elf|con&s;i&s;tence</HI> as the <HI>ground</HI> of &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, con&s;cience has no more concern in the matter, than it has in the ea&s;i|ne&s;s, or unea&s;ine&s;s a man feels in him&s;elf, in reflecting on a &s;cheme of bu&s;ine&s;s as a &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent, or incon&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme.</P>
<P><Q>2.|The other thing which belongs to the approbati|on or di&s;approbation of natural con&s;cience, is the <HI>&s;en&s;e of de&s;ert;</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in a natural agreement, proportion and harmony between malevolence or injury, and re|&s;entment and puni&s;hment; or between loving and be|ing loved, between &s;hewing kindne&s;s and being reward|ed, &amp;c.&mdash;Approbation and di&s;approbation of con&s;ci|ence, in the &s;en&s;e now explained, will extend to all virtue and vice, to every thing <HI>what&s;oever,</HI> that is <HI>mo|rally</HI> good or evil, in a mind&mdash;that will take things in general into its con&s;ideration, and is free from &s;pecula|tive error.&mdash;And thus we may &s;ee in what re&s;pects this natural con&s;cience extends to true virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in union of heart to being <HI>in general,</HI> and &s;upreme love to God. For altho' it <HI>&s;ees not,</HI> or rather, does not ta&s;te its <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> beauty, i. e. it ta&s;tes no <HI>&s;weetne&s;s</HI> in benevolence to being in general, <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> or

<P N="1"><PB N="29" REF="012067_0015_0F89942C0FDBDC38">
1. Mr. Edwards acknowledges, as we have &s;een, that there is, in natural con&s;cience, a moral ta&s;te or &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil, or of virtue and vice determining the mind to approve the one and condemn the other; that this &s;en&s;e concurs with the law of God, and is of equal extent with it; &s;uppo&s;ing the under&s;tanding duly informed, &amp;c. This is true in it&s;elf, and as much as any moral philo&s;opher can in rea&s;on demand; but is not true, on his &s;cheme, but is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with his notions of the e&s;&s;ence of virtue and moral beauty or ex|cellence: Which, according to him, e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in pure benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered; which natural con&s;cience don't, and can't &s;ee, and the moral ta&s;te can't reli&s;h: that the inferior beauty of moral things, in which their virtuou&s;ne&s;s does not at all con&s;i&s;t, and 'which is of the '&s;ame &s;ort' with the beauty of inani|mate things is the only object of this faculty called con|&s;cience and moral &s;en&s;e. If &s;o, this natural &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te is not at all of the moral kind any more than a natural ta&s;te for mu&s;ic or painting. Mr. Edwards &s;ays, 'natu|ral con&s;cience&mdash;will approve of true virtue without &s;ee|ing the true beauty of it.' Approve of that which you have no idea of, no reli&s;h for. Is not this a contradicti|on? 'Tis the &s;ame thing, upon his &s;cheme, as to &s;ay that a man who &s;ees and approves the beautiful countenance and dre&s;s of an angel, in &s;o doing approves of his vir|tue, when at the &s;ame time he has no conception or re|li&s;h of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Edwards &s;ays, 'Benevolence <HI>alone</HI> can ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s, or di&s;cern the beauty of true virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered. The na|tural con&s;cience and moral &s;en&s;e can't di&s;cern and reli&s;h this true moral beauty. How &s;hould it? This moral fa|culty was given us, and is fitted in its nature for the pur|po&s;e of di&s;cerning and approving the moral fitne&s;s, pro|portion and equity there is in the relative duties we owe to God and our neighbour.&mdash;But we have no &s;uch re|lation to being &s;imply con&s;idered, and that has no &s;uch
<PB N="30" REF="012067_0016_0F89942CB5615050">characters as to infer a natural or moral fitne&s;s or equity in our performing any duty to it. Natural con&s;cience is wholly ignorant of it, and as unintere&s;ted in it, as in a dream, or in the phantoms in Milton's limbo of vanity. Our author implicitly owns that there is no natural ju&s;tice and proportion in this kind of benevolence. His di&s;tinction between the primary and &s;econdary beauty is grounded on this &s;uppo&s;ition.&mdash;If we &s;uppo&s;e there is a natural ju&s;|tice, proportion, or harmonious agreement between this &s;imple benevolence and its object, or any &s;uitablene&s;s therein to the characters and relations of being &s;imply con&s;idered, and that the benevolent mind, has a regard hereto, in exerci&s;ing this benevolence, we reduce this pri|mary and e&s;&s;ential moral beauty into a <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> and &s;o the very e&s;&s;ence of virtue will vani&s;h and be lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. Edwards acknowledges, as we have &s;een, that there is, in natural con&s;cience a &s;en&s;e of <HI>de&s;ert,</HI> and that it is connected with the moral ta&s;te and approbation of the proportion and ju&s;tice there is in all tho&s;e relative duties we owe to God and our neighbour; and he allows that this connection which natural con&s;cience makes, is ju&s;t, and agreeable to the true nature of things. And yet he lays that the true virtuou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e actions or duties does not con&s;i&s;t in any &s;uch natural proportion, fitne&s;s or ju&s;tice, but in &s;omething of a higher and very different nature, even in this that they flow from, and are the expre&s;&s;ions of benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;i|dered.&mdash;This worthy gentleman is totally incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf in the&s;e things.&mdash;</P>
<P>Moral de&s;ert is nece&s;&s;arily connected with, and has a natural and direct relation to, that quality in moral acti|ons wherein their virtuou&s;ne&s;s or viciou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and to nothing el&s;e. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary is the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>If then natural con&s;cience points out the moral ground of de&s;ert, of approbation or blame <HI>truly,</HI> Mr. Edwards's notions of the nature and e&s;&s;ence of virtue are e&s;&s;entially wrong. But if his notions are right, natural con&s;cience
<PB N="31" REF="012067_0016_0F89942CB5615050">has no perception or &s;en&s;e of that quality in moral acti|ons wherein their virtuou&s;ne&s;s e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts, but, as a wrong headed thing, places it in that wherein it does not at all con&s;i&s;t, and &s;o connects the &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert wrong, and contrary to the true nature of things. He who form'd the natural con&s;cience or moral &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as it is, is then the author of this <HI>fal&s;e connection</HI> of de&s;ert, and has given us a guide to virtue, which, from the very con&s;titution of its nature, unavoidably deceives us. In|deed it leads us, as our author &s;ays, to judge all tho&s;e moral actions virtuous which are really &s;o, and none but &s;uch; &s;uppo&s;ing it is duly enlightened. But then it leads us to place their virtuou&s;ne&s;s in their <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beau|ty, and does not perceive and can't reli&s;h that quality in which their virtuou&s;ne&s;s does mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially and wholly con&s;i&s;t; (as Mr. Edwards conceeds.) And herein it naturally and nece&s;&s;arily deceives us, and leads us to ap|prove our actions as virtuous and acceptable, while there is no more true virtuou&s;ne&s;s in them than in &s;inging a harmonious tune. Has God given to mankind &s;uch a blundering, blind leader, as the natural guide of life, think you?</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us ob&s;erve wherein Mr. Edwards places the e&s;|&s;ential difference between the moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, and a truly <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;en&s;e, or <HI>virtuous</HI> ta&s;te. He allows, as we have &s;een, that they both approve and condemn the &s;ame things, i. e. all morally good and evil actions; but &s;ays they do this upon different grounds, and with different kinds of approbation. The moral ta&s;te reli&s;hes virtuous actions, <HI>only</HI> on account of their &s;econdary beauty; the truly virtuous &s;en&s;e approves them, <HI>chiefly</HI> on account of their primary beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered. I mu&s;t de&s;ire the readers attention to two &s;hort quotations more; which complete the evi|dence that this is Mr. Edwards's notion of the difference between the <HI>moral,</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> ta&s;te. He &s;ays, <Q>Appro|bation of con&s;cience is the more readily mi&s;taken for a

But it can't con&s;i&s;t in what this great man here places it in.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ubject of &s;o great, practical importance, that we may properly employ a few tho'ts upon it.&mdash;Mr. Edwards's rea&s;oning &s;uppo&s;es that if the true virtuou&s;|ne&s;s of morally good actions con&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e qualities, of moral proportion, harmony and ju&s;tice, on account of which natural con&s;cience, or the moral &s;en&s;e approves and reli&s;hes them, this approbation would be virtuous; and &s;o natural or vicious men would be virtuous men. But in this he is greatly mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>By the moral di&s;cernment and ta&s;te, natural to man, we are con&s;tituted moral agents. By the exerci&s;e of this moral faculty the things that are morally good or virtu|ous are &s;een to be <HI>&s;o, as &s;uch</HI> are approved, the obligati|on we are under to choo&s;e and practi&s;e them, in prefer|ence to every thing that &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to them, is felt, in &s;ome degree. If we do &s;o, we are &s;elf-approved; but if we &s;uffer vicious lu&s;ts, and worldly intere&s;ts to prevail, in oppo&s;ition to this &s;en&s;e of the mind, we are condemned by our&s;elves. All this &s;hews that man is de&s;igned for virtue in his creation, and that his happine&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="012067_0017_0F89942D7698FD60">is connected with his being virtuous, but does not render him &s;o. To render a man truly virtuous or holy, his heart mu&s;t agree with his enlightned con&s;cience, or moral &s;en&s;e; or in other words his will mu&s;t choo&s;e, with pre|fering love, and a determined re&s;olution to practi&s;e, what is approved and recommended by the moral &s;en&s;e; and this, not in &s;ome particular branches of virtue only, but in its whole extent, giving up every contrary lu&s;t to be mortified, and all incon&s;i&s;tent intere&s;ts, as lo&s;s for its &s;ake, or which is the &s;ame thing, for God's &s;ake and his king|dom's. This &s;en&s;e, choice and attachment of the heart to God, or to virtue and its intere&s;ts, is that wherein a truly virtuous ta&s;te or &s;piritual &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;ts, as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the natural, moral &s;en&s;e of the mind. They are really two di&s;tinct things, tho' in perfect harmony. In virtuous minds they both agree in one; but in vici|ous minds the prevailing reli&s;h of the heart, or tendency and choice of the will, is in oppo&s;ition to the moral &s;en&s;e, in partial favour to particular lu&s;ts, and their intere&s;ts. In this ca&s;e the heart is perver&s;e, the man is froward and willful, condemned of him&s;elf in that which he allows. Herein confi&s;ts the exceeding &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.13. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is no cure for this evil di&s;ea&s;e of the heart, but by the grace and truths of the go&s;pel, as &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed upon the mind by the &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If the perver&s;ene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of wicked minds prevails to that degree, under the enlightening influences and &s;trivings of the &s;pirit of truth and grace, as to provoke the Lord to withdraw his gracious influences, and give them wholly up to their own hearts lu&s;ts, their perver&s;e|ne&s;s becomes ab&s;olutely incureable, and they go into per|dition. 'Tis in vain to expect a miraculous exertion of properly creating power, to form their hearts anew, or regenerate them, without light or the word of go&s;pel truth, after the moral power of the go&s;pel, and &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has failed of doing it, thro' their perver&s;e re&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t, and unconquerable enmity
<PB N="34" REF="012067_0018_0F89942E33E69F00">to the truth he teaches. Yet this is what &s;ome gentle|men do; who teach it for doctrine that men are always regenerated in this manner, and can be in no other; that their enmity and prever&s;e re&s;i&s;tance to the holy Spirit uni|ver&s;ally increa&s;es in proportion as he enlightens their minds, and &s;trives with them by the go&s;pel truth. This doctrine is directly contrary to the doctrine of the go&s;pel, and to experience, and of very hurtful tendency and in|fluence.</P>
<P N="5">5. From Mr. Edwards's doctrines it does nece&s;&s;arily follow that men are under <HI>no natural</HI> obligation to be virtuous at all according to his notion of virtue, and can't equitably be required to be &s;o. They may indeed be re|quired to practi&s;e all relative duties to particular beings, from a regard to their <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty, or relative fitne&s;s; for God has made them capable of di&s;cerning and ta&s;t|ing this, by endowing them with moral &s;en&s;e. But there is nothing virtuous in all this, <Q>con&s;idered &s;imply, and by it&s;elf.</Q> Benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, and <Q>for being <HI>in general</HI>'s <HI>&s;ake,</HI> and delight in this principle <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> is that in which all true virtue prima|rily con&s;i&s;ts, out of which all truly virtuous exerci&s;es of mind to particular beings ari&s;e.</Q> But natural con&s;ci|ence and the moral &s;en&s;e, can't ta&s;te and approve this kind of virtue any more than the white of an egg; and natural rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e &s;ay there is no worth in it, nor any u&s;e or occa&s;ion for it in the moral world. Nothing but this preternatural principle it&s;elf can ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of this primary beauty, or perceive any moral excellence in this &s;ort of virtue. Doubtle&s;s this is true; for it lies far beyond the &s;phere of natural con&s;ci|ence, and the moral ta&s;te. It is no object to them, con|&s;equently man is, by the con&s;titution of his nature, as incapable of &s;eeing, or ta&s;ting this <HI>primary</HI> beauty of mo|ral things, as bea&s;ts are of reli&s;hing their <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty. He is no more made for the one, than they are for the other, and is no more obliged to reli&s;h the one than they are to reli&s;h the other; and can't equitably be required
<PB N="35" REF="012067_0018_0F89942E33E69F00">to do &s;o, til a new faculty, or ta&s;te is given him, adapted to this object, by a new creating act of power; (which is what Mr. Edwards's di&s;ciples, at the bottom, intend by what they call regeneration, if I under&s;tand their writ|ings.) Yet Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, incon&s;i&s;tently e|nough with it&s;elf, &s;ays, he is &s;o obliged, at the &s;ame time that it confe&s;&s;es he has, in his nature, no faculty, &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, in the exerci&s;e of which it is po&s;&s;ible for him ever to reach this beauty, however perfectly the under&s;tand|ing is inlightened, and freed from blinding, &s;tupifying prejudices. Mr. Hopkins &s;ays, nothing that &s;imple in|tellect is capable of, can give the idea of any thing <HI>pro|perly moral.</HI>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Sermon of John 1.13. p. 43.</NOTE> By <HI>moral,</HI> I pre&s;ume he intends what Mr. Edwards calls the primary and only true moral beauty. And yet the intellect is the leading faculty, which con|&s;titutes us moral and accountable agents.</P>
<P>The teachers of the&s;e doctrines endeavour to defend them again&s;t the above objection, by &s;aying, men's ina|bility to reli&s;h the true beauty of virtue, or what they call, after Mr. Edwards, the true moral excellency, is of the moral kind, the fault of the will, and &s;o does not ex|cu&s;e: that if they had a will, a right di&s;po&s;ition and heart to this, it would then be no more impo&s;&s;ible than any thing el&s;e.&mdash;This is no more than &s;aying, if they had this new kind of reli&s;h, which is fal&s;ely called a truly &s;piritu|al &s;en&s;e, or virtuous ta&s;te, they would have it, and if they had it, they might ea&s;ily exerci&s;e it. But what is this to the purpo&s;e, when at the &s;ame time they confe&s;s there is no natural faculty in human nature, by any po&s;|&s;ible application of truth to which, this ta&s;te can be rai&s;|ed up in the heart? On the&s;e principles, we might, with as much rea&s;on, and as good a grace &s;ay, the inability a blind man is under to &s;ee and reli&s;h the beauty of light, is of the moral kind, and &s;olemnly impute it to him as &s;in.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>That kind of moral inability which does not excu&s;e from blame, but rather aggravates it, is that which our Saviour, and the prophets and apo&s;tles, charge upon the prever&s;e Jews, when they &s;ay, <HI>they have eyes</HI> and &s;ee not, ears and hear not, hearts capable of under&s;tanding, &amp; yet under&s;tand not, that they have clo&s;ed their own eyes, &s;topped their ears, and made their hearts gro&s;s, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes, hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their hearts, and be converted. It confi&s;ts in an indi&s;po&s;ition and perver&s;e refu&s;al to ex|ert tho&s;e moral powers which men have; thro' partial attachment to the lu&s;ts and intere&s;ts of &s;in. But upon the principles of Mr. Ed|wards's &s;cheme the inability of natural men to &s;ee, or rather ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of what he calls virtue, con&s;i&s;ts in the want of a natural fa|culty or ta&s;te &s;uited to the object: and according to his new notion of virtue, it truly does &s;o. And to &s;upply this defect in nature, a new faculty, or reli&s;h, quite of a new and &s;upernatural kind is added in re|generation, by a new, creating act. This then is no more a moral inability than <Q>the want of a reli&s;h for the plea&s;ant &s;weetne&s;s of ho|ney, in a man who has no ta&s;te for it, and never had.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hopkins's &s;ermon on John 1.13. p. 41, 42.</NOTE></Q> The are is as truly a natural or phy&s;ical inability as the other, and is as much incon&s;i&s;tent with moral obligation.</P>
<P>Some will &s;ay, this lo&s;s of the primitive ta&s;te for the true moral bea|ty, is the fruit and puni&s;hment of the fir&s;t apo&s;tacy.&mdash;Suppo&s;e it to be &s;o; what is the con&s;equence?&mdash;Suppo&s;e, in&s;tead of taking away the original reli&s;h for the primary beauty, &s;o intirely, that it can't be re|covered but by a new act of creating power. 'altogether equivalent to fir&s;t creation,' God had puni&s;hed the fir&s;t &s;in by &s;miting Adam with blindne&s;s, and bringing all his children into the world naturally blind. Would the pre&s;ent incapacity of man to reli&s;h the beauty of light, be a moral incapacity? Would a law from heaven, requiring him to &s;ee and rejoice in the light of the &s;un, on the penalty of damnation, at the &s;ame time refu&s;ing to re&s;tore his eyes, be tho't ju&s;t? A Nero could not be brought to make &s;uch a law.&mdash;The truth is, thro' the fall, all our original moral powers are weakened, but none of them de&s;troyed; but the chief mi&s;chief is, that a vicious indi&s;po&s;ition or aver&s;ion to im|prove the moral abilities or feculties we have, for the purpo&s;es of virtue and per&s;onal religion, has gotten hold of our hearts.

<P>This &s;cheme of doctrines, tends to de&s;troy true virtue and real religion. It repre&s;ents virtue as an unnatural thing, places it on a fal&s;e and indefen&s;ible foundation, and pours contempt upon it, by repre&s;enting its true bea|ty, and moral excellencies as of the 'very &s;ame &s;ort with the beauty of material things.' If it is once believed that the&s;e are doctrines of the bible, chri&s;tianity will be re|jected with great &s;corn; but they are not to be found there. Yet, &s;omehow, this &s;cheme has obtained too much credit in the country. While chri&s;tian divines propagate the&s;e notions, infidels triumph.&mdash;The great veneration for Mr. Edwards, will doubtle&s;s, in part, ac|count for the great &s;pread of his unhappy mi&s;takes. As the &s;ear of man brings a &s;nare, &s;o does too great vene|ration. This has been the &s;in and &s;nare of the&s;e late times. It began to work powerfully about thirty years ago, in the almo&s;t idolatrous e&s;teem and veneration for a young clergyman from abroad. But let us venerate

<P>Many per&s;ons, no doubt, will be &s;urprized to find &s;o great and worthy a man as Mr. Edwards was, forming &s;o wrong a &s;cheme of thoughts.&mdash;They may be told, &amp; have &s;een, he was incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and &s;ome|times acknowledges the truth. In &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages he &s;peaks excellently. But his great unhappine&s;s was, he endea|voured to blend a &s;et of imaginary notions with the truth; but he could not make them mix and cleave together. Hence the reigning incon&s;i&s;tency. 'Tis only the fal&s;e part that has been expo&s;ed and cen&s;ured. This ought to be &s;o, for truth and virtue's &s;ake.&mdash;Altho' <HI>Being &s;imp|ly con&s;idered,</HI> is &s;et up as an idol of the imagination, yet we firmly believe, his heart never honored it with chief, nor with any love, but &s;tatedly wor&s;hiped the living God <HI>only,</HI> as the fir&s;t and &s;upreme object of virtuous love and regard.&mdash;But an unhappy &s;cheme of imaginations, part|ly prevailed over his judgment, and the truer ta&s;te of his heart, when he was writing his di&s;&s;ertation upon virtue.</P>
<P>I am not obliged to account for this.&mdash;However, I &s;uppo&s;e this aro&s;e <HI>partly</HI> from &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s his rea&s;oning powers were thrown into by &s;ome rea&s;onings and objecti|ons he had met with. Perhaps he did not &s;ee any other way to reconcile the admi&s;&s;ion of a moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, in natural men, in &s;uch a latitude as he &s;ee him&s;elf oblig|ed to admit it, with their being wholly de&s;titute of, and dead to all true virtue, and enemies to it, in heart, but by removing virtue away, quite out of the view of the mo|ral faculty, and placing its e&s;&s;ence in what the moral ta&s;te has no &s;en&s;e of, or reli&s;h for; and reducing tho&s;e moral qualities, which it confe&s;&s;edly has an approving and plea&s;ed ta&s;te of, into the low rank and order of ma|terial beauties. Some things which he has droped, here and there, I think, render it probable that this was the ca&s;e. He &s;ays,' (p. 179.) <Q>Approbation of con&s;cience is the more readily mi&s;taken for a truly virtuous appro|bation, becau&s;e&mdash;it agrees with the latter as the ob|ject

The law of &s;in in their members, which wars again&s;t the law of the mind, does too effectually re&s;train them from being truly virtu|ous, without the nece&s;&s;ity of removing virtue out of the view of the law of the mind, and &s;etting up being &s;imply con&s;idered, as virtue's fir&s;t and grand object.</P>
<P>It was manife&s;tly &s;uch a kind of di&s;tre&s;s, ari&s;ing from another quarter, that induced this great man, in the lat|ter part of his an&s;wer to Dr. Taylor, after he had over|thrown his &s;cheme, to admit, by way of an&s;wer to &s;ome of the Doctor's objections again&s;t the Calvini&s;tic doctrine, the extravagantly ab&s;urd notions of Adam and all his &s;eed being <HI>one</HI> complex, <HI>moral per&s;on,</HI> or <HI>moral whole,</HI> and of <HI>per&s;onal identity</HI> being a purely <HI>arbitrary</HI> thing, not at all founded in a phi&s;ical onene&s;s, or &s;amene&s;s of being; whereby he has really given up the orthodox doctrine of a proper imputation of Adam's &s;in to his po&s;terity, as a public or family &s;in, as being the &s;in of their family head; and expo&s;ed the doctrine of original &s;in, in&s;tead of defending it; and has betrayed the very foundation of God's moral government, and changed it into the ab&s;urde&s;t thing that can be imagined; &s;o far as a doctrinal mi&s;repre&s;entation of things can do it.</P>
<P>Perhaps from &s;ome &s;uch cau&s;e Mr. Edwards was de|termined to adopt that &s;cheme of tho'ts concerning mo|ral liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural, which is opened in his treati&s;e concerning the will.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the e&s;&s;ential nature of true virtue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOral virtue (or holine&s;s) in the mo&s;t comprehen|&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the words, includes all that is mo|rally good and right in moral beings, and, as &s;uch, wor|thy of approbation, prai&s;e and reward.</P>
<P>Virtue is a complex thing: It does not primarily con|fi&s;t in one &s;ingle di&s;po&s;ition, tendency, or affection of the
<PB N="41" REF="012067_0021_0F8994307567F388">mind, all other virtuous affections ari&s;ing our of that as their root; but includes various affections equally ori|ginal and e&s;&s;ential to virtue, and others that are &s;econda|ry. The&s;e are all perfectly harmonious. Their re&s;ule is honor and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Virtue has its &s;eat in the mind: not in the under&s;tand|ing only, nor in the will only. Both mu&s;t conqur in the exerci&s;es that are truly virtuous. The mind, as intelli|gent, &s;ees the things that are virtuous, and approves them as morally right and worthy to be cho&s;en, in preference to every thing incon&s;i&s;tent therewith. But altho' the mind &s;ees and approves the things that are virtuous and excellent, yet if this mental approbation is not followed and crowned by a free and determined choice of them, by the heart, but any incon&s;i&s;tent affections prevail, and determine the mind to act contrary to its own moral &s;en&s;e of what is right, the mind is not virtuous but vi|cious. This is the character of all willful &s;inners, or wicked men.&mdash;On the other hand, the virtuous tendency or propen&s;ity of the heart does not con&s;i&s;t in any blind in&s;tinct, either natural or &s;upernatural; but the mind in all its virtuous propen&s;ities and exerci&s;es acts with under|&s;tanding, under the &s;weet influence of light. But let us ob&s;erve more particularly.</P>
<P>1&s;t. As God is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Being, from whom all others derive their being and their all, virtue or holi|ne&s;s, is in him as its &s;ource and original. He is e&s;&s;enti|ally, ab&s;olutely and independently virtuous and holy. He has in him&s;elf all po&s;&s;ible mental powers and per&s;ee|tions; his under&s;tanding and power are infinite. All his works are known to him from the beginning. He forefees all future beings and things with equal clearne&s;s, as if they &s;tood in pre&s;ent exi&s;tence before his eye. He thus lees all his creatures, in all their various ranks and orders, and infinitely various capacities and characters, natural and moral, and views them in all their relations to him&s;elf, and in their relations to, and connections with each other; and &s;ees what di&s;po&s;itions, actions and con|duct,
<PB N="42" REF="012067_0022_0F8994313578EB48">in him&s;elf to them all, and in them &s;everally to|wards him, and to one another, are an&s;werable and equi|tably adapted to his character and to theirs, and to all the various relations between him and them, and among them&s;elves, and the happy tendency and re&s;ult of &s;uch a univer&s;ally equitable and right conduct, and the wrong|ne&s;s and evil nature and mi&s;erable con&s;equences of the contrary.&mdash;And as God &s;ees all the&s;e things in a perfect light, &s;o he fully and ab&s;olutely approves the equitable, and good, and abhors the contrary; and ever determines his own actions and treatment of his creatures, agreably to this moral &s;en&s;e of his own mind; and he wills and commands that his rational creatures &s;hould govern them&s;elves by a regard to what is equitable, and morally fit and right, in their whole moral conduct. Tho&s;e that do &s;o, he approves; tho&s;e that act in a contrary manner, he blames; and will ble&s;s the one and puni&s;h the other, unle&s;s they repent and amend.&mdash;As his moral di&s;cern|ment and ta&s;te, or mental approbation of moral good, can't be corrupted or impo&s;ed on, &s;o 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that his heart or will &s;hould be perverted and drawn into the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tence with his &s;en&s;e of what is fit and right; for he can have no motive to be thus incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and do what his own mind, as intelligent and moral, does nece&s;&s;arily, ab&s;olutely and uniformly di&s;ap|prove and condemn as evil and hateful, in its nature, tendency and con&s;equences. <Q>God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all, a God of truth, without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.&mdash;God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</Q></P>
<P>If God is thus perfectly wi&s;e and holy, and equitable, or virtuous, it hence follows, that it is the 'good plea&s;ure of his will' to give his family of rational creatures as great a mea&s;ure of happine&s;s as can be communicated by the exerci&s;e of a paternal government over them, perfectly wi&s;e, and perfectly virtuous or holy, and <HI>no more.</HI>&mdash;In|deed more can't be communicated. An attempt to give more, would defeat its own de&s;ign, and, in the i&s;&s;ue, de|&s;troy
<PB N="43" REF="012067_0022_0F8994313578EB48">the happine&s;s of his children, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing it.&mdash;Goodne&s;s in God is the goodne&s;s of a mind ab|&s;olutely virtuous and perfectly intelligent. It is then a mo&s;t virtuous propen&s;ity to do what becomes the holy Father of Spirits to do, in forming his offspring to an e&s;tabli&s;hed virtuou&s;ne&s;s of character, in conformity to him&s;elf; and it further implies a will to render &s;uch hap|py, and a plea&s;ure in making, and &s;eeing them &s;o: But it can't will to make the vicious happy: This is abhor|rent to virtuous goodne&s;s or love.&mdash;If any are fallen from virtue, virtuous goodne&s;s will di&s;po&s;e the Father of Spi|rits to u&s;e proper methods to recover them to virtue, &amp; &s;o, in con&s;equence, to happine&s;s, if the circum&s;tances of their ca&s;e are &s;uch, as to render it wi&s;e and fit to extend &s;uch kind care to them. But if not, their ca&s;e is de&s;pe|rate, and they are <HI>ca&s;t away,</HI> as no longer objects of vir|tuous goodne&s;s and care. This is the condition of apo&s;|tate angels; the former, that of mankind as fallen in Adam.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us next con&s;ider the nature of true virtue as it is in &s;ubordinate intelligent beings, the off&s;pring of God. In general, it con&s;i&s;ts in right and equitable di&s;po&s;itions and actions towards God and our fellow &s;ervants. And tho&s;e are right and equitable which are an&s;werable to, and harmoniou&s;ly agree with their re&s;pective characters, actions, and relations to us, and to one another.</P>
<P>Our Lord &s;ums up the whole under two general heads, viz. Supreme love to God, and equitable love to our neighbour. As virtue in all orders of intelligent crea|tures is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, this is a ju&s;t &s;ummary of it, in regard to them all. Let us then con&s;ider virtue, both as it re&s;pects God and our neighbour.</P>
<P>1&s;t. As it re&s;pects God, it &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts in our loving him with all our heart, i. e. with &s;upreme, ruling, pious affection and regard. In <HI>this true</HI> virtue <HI>primarily, radically,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;ts. This &s;upreme love to God is doubtle&s;s to be under&s;tood in a comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, as including that complex affection and pious re|gard
<PB N="44" REF="012067_0023_0F899431F578DBA8">to him which is an&s;werable to his whole revealed character, and &s;everal relations to us. God, con&s;idered in him&s;elf, and in his relations to us, is mo&s;t worthy of our highe&s;t fear and love, tru&s;t and confidence, of our whole &s;ervice and indire obedience, and to be regarded, &s;ought, and delighted in as the chief good and la&s;t end of all things. The&s;e are e&s;&s;ential parts of godline&s;s, or virtuou&s;ne&s;s of heart towards God, and are to be under|&s;tood as comprehended in this fir&s;t and great command, 'Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,' &amp;c:</P>
<P>The&s;e right and pious di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of the mind towards God, are the re&s;ult of a <HI>true</HI> knowledge, and <HI>realizing</HI> &s;en&s;e of God in the mind, as clothed with his true characters and relations to us; which is given by God him&s;elf, by the mini&s;try of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thro' the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t. Some writers indeed a&s;&s;ert, that there mu&s;t fir&s;t be wro't, by the miraculous creating power of the &s;pirit, a moral change; (as they de&s;cribe it, it is a phi&s;ical change) or that a new heart, or virtuous ta&s;te, and &s;piritual &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be created, be|fore any po&s;&s;ible inlightening of the mind in the know|ledge of God can have any influence in exciting and Brawing forth any right affections and exerci&s;es of the heart towards him. This they &s;eem to con&s;ider as a &s;ort of &s;ub&s;tratum and &s;upport to all the acts and exerci&s;es of virtue&punc; But they ought to have reflected, that God him|&s;elf, is the &s;ource and &s;upport of virtue in us; which is the re-action of our minds towards him, an&s;wering to his action and influence on them, by the light and moral power of his glory and love; or their attraction and ac|tive tendency towards him, in con&s;equence of their be|ing brought under the attractive influence of his ble&s;&s;ed character and gracious love to us in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Our Lord u&s;es a &s;imilar manner of expre&s;&s;ion when he &s;peaks of his Father's drawing men, and their coming to him in con&s;equence thereof; which drawing he makes to con|fi&s;t in God's &s;o teaching them as that they hear and learn of him. Again he &s;ays, <Q>If I be lifted up from
<PB N="45" REF="012067_0023_0F899431F578DBA8">the earth, I will <HI>draw</HI> all men unto me.</Q> 'Tis by the doctrine of his cro&s;s that the attracting glory and love of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t are mo&s;t clearly manife&s;ted: And all who behold and realize this glory of the Lord, are drawn by its influence and come to him, and are changed.</P>
<P>To talk of a moral change in the mind, forming the heart in a virtuous temper, as preceeding this attraction of God upon the mind, and as nece&s;&s;ary to render that effectual, is the &s;ame ab&s;urdity in divinity or moral phi|lo&s;ophy as it would be in natural, to a&s;&s;ert that a body naturally cold, mu&s;t fir&s;t change its nature, and become of a hot nature, like the &s;un, before it can be warmed by the action of the &s;un's rays upon it, however near the &s;un may approach towards it.</P>
<P>Moreover, let it be ob&s;erved that God, con&s;idered by the mind in his <HI>relative</HI> characters, and ab&s;olute perfecti|ons, or as exerci&s;ing his perfections in all his relations &amp; works to his creatures, is the complete object of pious regard; which regard is an&s;werable to the characters &amp; various relations in which he is &s;een by the believing mind: And in this an&s;werablene&s;s, and harmonious a|greement of the affections and actions of the mind to his characters, relations and works, their virtuou&s;ne&s;s, or moral excellence and acceptablene&s;s <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;ts. This is the view which is given us of this matter thro'|out the in&s;pired writings.&mdash;It is very &s;urpri&s;ing to hear great and good men repre&s;ent all relative duties which we owe to God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;idered as perform|ed from a regard to their relative characters and works, and to the equitablene&s;s and &s;uitablene&s;s of &s;uch returns, as beauties of an inferior kind, and as having nothing of true virtuou&s;ne&s;s and moral excellence in them, 'con&s;i|&s;idered &s;imply, and by them&s;elves' but only as they ari&s;e out of, and are the various exerci&s;es of pure benevolence to Being in general, <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> as intelligent.&mdash;Such mi&s;repre&s;entations and the doctrines built upon them, extremely di&s;gu&s;t inlightened and virtuous men, and per|plex
<PB N="46" REF="012067_0024_0F899432B5DA06A8">the &s;imple, and confound their under&s;tanding, and involve practical religion (the plaine&s;t thing in the world, adapted to the capacities of the vulgar) in a cloud, and give it &s;o my&s;terious an appearance, that they are tempt|ed to &s;u&s;pect there is nothing real in it, or if there is, that it is &s;o far removed out of their view, that 'tis in vain to trouble them&s;elves about it. How &s;orely is vir|tue wounded in the hou&s;e of its friends!</P>
<P>2dly. Virtue, as it re&s;pects our neighbour, &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts in loving him <HI>as our&s;elves.</HI> Which implies that there is a love of our&s;elves, which is virtuous, and ap|proved by God: otherwi&s;e our loving our neighbour as our&s;elves could not be a virtuous love.&mdash;This virtuous love of our neighbour is explained by our Lord as im|plying &s;uch an equitable affection or di&s;po&s;ition of mind towards him, as engages us to do to him all things what&s;o|ever we would, that he &s;hould do to us, or could in rea|&s;on and equity expect him to do, if we were in his cir|cum&s;tances and he in ours.</P>
<P>This virtuous and equitable regard to our&s;elves and to our neighbour, is the re&s;ult of a true knowledge or faith of God, as graciou&s;ly revealed to us, and a truly pi|ous and filial regard to him, viewed in his true character, and relations to our&s;elves and to our neighbour. Or in other words, this equitable love is the offspring of piety to God.&mdash;Without a true knowledge of God, and our relations to him, we can't truly know our&s;elves, or our neighbour; and in con&s;equence can't know what man|ner and mea&s;ure of love and regard to him, and to our|&s;elves is equitable, and agreeable to the righteous will of God: And without a true, pious, governing love and regard to God, our love and re&s;pect to our&s;elves and our neighbour, will nece&s;&s;arily be ungoverned, and in a great mea&s;ure irregular, and in many of its exerci&s;es, in ma|ny re&s;pects, inequitable, or unrighteous; and therefore vicious and blameworthy, <HI>&s;o far as inequitable.</HI></P>
<P>The truly virtuous mind views him&s;elf, and his neigh|bour, as God's creatures, &s;ubjects of his government, &amp;
<PB N="47" REF="012067_0024_0F899432B5DA06A8">objects of his good-will, and paternal care; who &s;eeks their true good, virtue and happine&s;s; and reflects that it is the good plea&s;ure of his will that he, and every one do &s;o too, in humble dependence on him, the great Fa|ther of Love, and fountain of good.&mdash;In this view, conformably to God's will, he bears a true, friendly, e|quitable regard to him&s;elf, and his neighbour, and en|deavours, according to his ability, to promote his own, and his neighbour's good, &s;ubordinate to God, and to advance him&s;elf, and his fellow &s;ervants in virtue, pre|parative to true happine&s;s; with humble prayer to the Great Father of the whole family in heaven and earth, to ble&s;s both them and him&s;elf, for his own goodne&s;s &s;ake, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;This &s;pirit of equitable, friendly regard, will di&s;po&s;e the virtuous mind to behave to every one in a manner &s;uitable to their various characters, of|fices, and relations, agreably, and in obedience to God's righteous law; which is written in the heart of the tru|ly virtuous.</P>
<P>The love of our neighbour, yea, of any individual, as &s;pringing out of the&s;e principles of faith and pious re|gard to God, is, in effect, <HI>univer&s;al</HI> love. For the&s;e prin|ciples will extend this &s;pirit of equitable, friendly regard to the whole family of God, to all his creatures, who are objects of his kind care and paternal good-will, when the mind is &s;o opened and enlarged, as to take in|to its view, his whole family as being &s;uch, and objects of his benevolent regard.&mdash;In this way it is that virtuous love or benevolence becomes general, and extends to all: not from its beginning in pure benevolence to being &s;imply con&s;idered, and &s;o from this root, branching out in benevolent regard to particular beings, to God and his intelligent creatures, as &s;harers in being, the fir&s;t be|loved; Which is an unnatural and unchri&s;tian notion, and has no countenance from &s;cripture, rea&s;on or expe|rience, but is condemned by them all. How far the idea of virtue given in this chapter is approved and &s;ug|ge&s;ted by in&s;pired teachers, the reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of that defective &s;ort of virtue which is ob&s;ervable in many men, who are not truly religious, but, upon the whole, are of a vicious character.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS undeniably true in fact, that natural con&s;cience and the moral &s;en&s;e, have a very con&s;iderable in|fluence in many men, who are not truly religious, in re|&s;training them from many &s;ins, and engaging them to practi&s;e many duties: Their hearts, in many in&s;tances, concur, in &s;ome degree, with the moral &s;en&s;e of their minds. A &s;en&s;e of equity, of moral honour, of gratitude, a &s;pirit of benevolence, compa&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. and &s;ome, kind of regard to God, influence them to do many worthy deeds, worthy <HI>in &s;ome re&s;pects,</HI> and in many le&s;&s;er in&s;tances to deny and controul particular evil di&s;po&s;itions, for their &s;akes, when yet they will deny and counteract all the&s;e for &s;ome other lu&s;ts, and under greater temptations, and have no effectually governing regard to God, and to virtue, its intere&s;ts and reward.</P>
<P>Writers are divided in their &s;entiments concerning actions of this kind. Some are di&s;po&s;ed to allow them to be virtuous in &s;ome degree. Others &s;ay there is no|thing in them that does at all partake of the nature of true virtue. This is Mr. Edwards's &s;entiment. Some others go farther, and &s;ay, they are perfect &s;ins, and, as &s;ome expre&s;s them&s;elves, abominable good works. Mr. Hopkins &s;ays, '<HI>all</HI> the exerci&s;es of the hearts of the un|regenerate; (even the be&s;t of them, under the highe&s;t in|fluences of common grace, and &s;trivings of the Holy Spirit) 'are in <HI>direct oppo&s;ition</HI> to God, his &s;pirit and law.'

<P>A di&s;tinction ought to be made between the denomi|nating character of the agent, and that of particular ac|tions which he does. The&s;e do not always agree. Both
<PB N="49" REF="012067_0025_0F89943373EEFBA0">virtuous and vicious men are generally imperfect in their re&s;pective characters in this life; and &s;ome are &s;o in a very great degree, e&s;pecially in the morning of their mo|ral life, and are in a great degree incon&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, in their di&s;po&s;itions and conduct. Some parti|cular actions, in both, are governed by, and denominated from the weaker principles and &s;prings of action, in them, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with, and belie their true, prevailing, denominating characters: If we judge of their re&s;pective characters by them, we &s;hall judge wrong. Truly vir|tuous or good men, &s;ometimes (ala&s;s! too frequently) do particular actions which are morally evil, <HI>wholly</HI> evil: the virtuous principles and tempers which habitually rule in them, have no degree of influence in producing them, but are quie&s;cent, or over-ruled by contrary prin|ciples or pa&s;&s;ions. In the&s;e things they act wholly out of character, con&s;idered as virtuous; and yet they act from an inward &s;pring in them&s;elves. Thus, for exam|ple, Peter was a believing and good man, but his deny|ing his Lord was a very evil thing, had not the lea&s;t tincture of faith or virtue in it, but &s;prang wholly out of &s;inful fear and criminal cowardice, which at that time &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed the actings of his faith, and virtuous love to his Ma&s;|ter. If this had been his habitually ruling principle, he would not have been a good or virtuous man, any more than tho&s;e jewi&s;h rulers who believed that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, but did not confe&s;s him, le&s;t they &s;hould be put out of the &s;ynagogue, becau&s;e they loved the prai&s;e of men, more than the prai&s;e of God. So, on the other hand, men of a vicious character do &s;ome particular ac|tions which do not &s;pring from any vicious principles or affections in their hearts, and have no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> viciou&s;ne&s;s in them.</P>
<P>I do not mean to in&s;inuate that they &s;pring from any <HI>truly</HI> virtuous principles of heart. They have no &s;uch principles of action in their hearts.&mdash;But there are certain middle principles or &s;prings of action wro't into the mind of man, by our gracious Creator, which, tho' they
<PB N="50" REF="012067_0026_0F899434330A21B0">are not virtuous, and do not nece&s;&s;arily imply a princi|ple of virtue in the heart, yet are friendly to virtue, and e&s;pou&s;e its cau&s;e within us, &s;uppo&s;e the mind duely in|&s;tructed: Such are rea&s;on, natural con&s;cience, the moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, &amp;c. The&s;e have &s;ome degree of influence, in many natural men. In &s;ome &s;ingle actions they rule. Thus, for in&s;tance, men, who&s;e hearts are far from be|ing in an habitual, and univer&s;ally equitable di&s;po&s;ition towards God and their neighbour, are many times deter|mined to do particular equitable actions to others from a regard to the equity of the ca&s;e, as their true&s;pring; and, for equity's &s;ake, deny them&s;elves in little things.&mdash; What is po&s;itive in &s;uch actions is not &s;inful or vicious; it is contrary to no law of God, but required in the law. But there is an e&s;&s;ential defect in the agent, which ren|ders him not well accepted: Yet he is not blamed, &s;tric|ly &s;peaking, for what he does, but for what is wanting to render his work perfect, or truly virtuous. What I intend will, perhaps, be be&s;t illu&s;trated in this manner. God commands his people to deal equitably, every man with his neighbour, from a regard to what is ju&s;t, and out of a &s;upreme re&s;pect and duty to him, their righte|ous Father and Judge, who loves righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates iniquity. Now A. in dealing with B. his neigh|bour, &s;ees what is right between them, and, from a re|gard to the equity of the ca&s;e, deals ju&s;tly with him, when at the &s;ame time he &s;ees how he might make an unrighteous gain by him, undi&s;covered: But in all this he has no true and obedient regard to God as his righte|ous Governor and Judge. (There are many &s;uch ca&s;es in real life.) The action he does is a right action, in re|&s;pect to what is po&s;itive in it, commanded by God, and the motive on which he acts is a right motive, one of the motives God wills him to be influenced by. There is therefore nothing evil in the action, <HI>po&s;itively</HI> con&s;ider|ed, nor in the motive upon which it is done: but the man is blame-worthy in that he is not influenced by a religious regard to God, as well as by a regard to the e|quity
<PB N="51" REF="012067_0026_0F899434330A21B0">of the ca&s;e, in re&s;pect to his neighbour. In this re|gard his action is <HI>e&s;&s;entially deficient,</HI> and weighed in a true balance is found light, and can't be accepted as an in|&s;tance of true, divine virtue.</P>
<P>To render actions truly virtuous, they mu&s;t be &s;ancti|fied by a &s;pirit of religious regard to God, mingling it &s;elf in with them. This is the true &s;alt which &s;ea&s;ons, and fits them to be offered to God as an acceptable &s;ac|rifice, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;If actions of the kind above &s;pe|cified, un&s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt, are at all con&s;idered as vir|tues, it mu&s;t be in an improper &s;en&s;e. If any are di&s;po|&s;ed to con&s;ider them as branches of virtue, they &s;hould repre&s;ent them as <HI>dead branches</HI> which have no vital union with the true root of the tree, viz. a &s;pirit of religious regard to God. As &s;uch they will &s;oon wither away, if not grafted upon the true &s;tock; like the faith of the &s;tony ground hearers, who have <HI>no root in them&s;elves.</HI>&mdash; Yet, on the other hand, men act very unadvi&s;edly in re|viling this kind of deficient actions, as having nothing in their nature but what is &s;in, and an abomination to God. There is &s;omething in them which is right, as we have &s;een, and required by God. This is approved, not abhorred and thrown back as dung in the faces of the doers of them:
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">God, &s;peaking to his people concerning their late covenant, to relea&s;e their &s;ervants, and actually &s;ending them out free, for a &s;hort time, tho' they &s;oon repented of this good deed, and brought them into bondage again, &s;ays, 'Ye were now turned, and had <HI>done right in my &s;ight,</HI> in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour.' Jerm. 34.15.</NOTE> Yet the agent is faulted for that which is want|ing in his work to render it truly holy, and accepted, as having all the e&s;&s;ential characters of truly good fruit.&mdash; This kind of actions which are not po&s;itively vicious, nor yet truly virtuous, may fitly be re&s;embled to what is called hi&s;torical faith; which implies a&s;&s;ent to the truth of the go&s;pel facts, founded on the proper evidence (which &s;aving faith al&s;o has) but the heart does not em|brace the truths believed with governing love; and
<PB N="52" REF="012067_0027_0F899435CF4564B0">therefore the faith is not &s;aving. For '<HI>with the heart</HI> man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.' Yet the a&s;&s;ent of the mind is not &s;inful. 'Thou believe&s;t there is one God. Thou <HI>do&s;t well</HI>' &s;ays the apo&s;tle James. But le&s;t men &s;hould re&s;t here, he adds, 'Devils al&s;o believe and trem|ble.'</P>
<P>Actions <HI>materially</HI> good, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three kinds; the fir&s;t are <HI>formally</HI> good, and truly virtu|ous and holy, acceptable and rewardable, upon the go&s;|pel plan of grace.&mdash;The &s;econd kind are &s;uch as have been mentioned above. Of this &s;ort the commendable behaviour of the young man in the go&s;pel was, whom our gracious Lord looked upon with love; but added, <HI>one thing thou lacke&s;t yet.</HI> May all his mini&s;ters learn of him.&mdash;The third &s;ort are &s;uch <HI>materially</HI> good actions as &s;pring from vicious motives and lu&s;ts of the heart. Such were the public prayers, fa&s;tings and alms of the Pha|ri&s;ees. The&s;e are <HI>po&s;itively</HI> vicious: the outward work is rendered unclean, profane and abominable by the vi|cious principle of the heart from which it proceeds.</P>
<P>When all the reformations and be&s;t moral actions of natural men, under the influence of an awakened and in|lightened con&s;cience, and the highe&s;t improvements of common grace, are repre&s;ented as altogether vicious, and in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;pirit and law of God, and a|bominable to him, like the Phari&s;ees prayers and alms, they are &s;et in a very fal&s;e light, and a &s;tumbling block is ca&s;t before the lame and the blind. A thing which their appointed <HI>guides</HI> ought not to do.</P>
