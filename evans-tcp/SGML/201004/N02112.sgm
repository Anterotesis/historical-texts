<P>IT has always been the Policy of the Teachers of Fal&s;e Religions, to keep their Principles from being nicely Examined into by the People, and it &s;eems, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, a Mark of a True One, when it is &s;ubmitted to the

<P><Q>I am the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;aiah xlii. ver&s;. 8.</NOTE> that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Prai&s;e to graven Images.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Produce your Cau&s;e, &s;aith the Lord, bring forth your &s;trong Rea&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. xli. v. 21.</NOTE> &s;aith the King of <HI>Jacob.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Let them bring forth and &s;hew us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 22.</NOTE> let them &s;hew the former Things what they be, that we may con&s;ider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, and know the latter End of them, or declare us Things for to come.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002509_0005_0FDB660536347AE8">
<Q>Shew the Things that are to come hereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> that we may know that ye are Gods; yea, do Good or do Evil, that we may be Di&s;mayed, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hold it together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Behold, ye are of nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE> and your Work of nought, an Abomination is he that choo&s;eth you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let all Nations be gathered together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap xliii. ver&s;. 9.</NOTE> and let the People be a&s;&s;embled; Who among them can declare this, and &s;hew us former Things? let them bring forth their Witne&s;&s;es, that they may be Ju&s;tified, or let them hear and &s;ay, it is Truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ye are my Witne&s;&s;es, &s;aith the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> and my Servant whom <HI>I</HI> have cho&s;en, that ye may know and believe me, and under&s;tand that <HI>I</HI> am He.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>I</HI> have declared, and have &s;aved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> and have &s;hew|ed when there was no &s;trange God among you, Therefore ye are my Witne&s;&s;es, &s;aith the Lord, that I am God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have declared the former Things from the beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. xlviii, 3.</NOTE> and they went forth out of my
<PB N="4" REF="002509_0006_0FDB6606A94B26D8">Mouth, and I &s;hewed them, I did then &s;uddainly, and they came to pa&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have even from the beginning declared it to thee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 5.</NOTE> before it came pa&s;s I &s;hewed it thee, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, mine Idol has done them, and my graven Image, and my molten Image has commanded them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou ha&s;t heard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> &s;ee all this, and will not ye declare it? I have &s;hewed thee now Things from this time, even hidden Things, and thou did&s;t not know them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They are created now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> and not from the beginning, even before the Day when thou heard&s;t them not, le&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, Be|hold, I knew them.</Q></P>
<P>Thus does the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> employ the the &s;tronge&s;t Terms to Recommend the Study of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> and the Ob&s;ervation of the Events which confirm the Truth of it; and St. <HI>Peter</HI> applies the Old Prophecies to the Times after Chri&s;t's Birth, in the&s;e words,</P>
<P><Q>Of which Salvation the Prophets have en|quired
<PB N="5" REF="002509_0007_0FDB660A80C65D40">and &s;earched diligently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. i. 10.</NOTE> who prophecy'd of the Grace that &s;hould come unto you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Searching what,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> or what manner of Time the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which was in them, did &s;ignifie, when it te&s;tified before-hand the Suffer|ings of Chri&s;t, and the Glory that &s;hould follow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Unto whom it was Revealed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> that not unto them&s;elves, but unto Us they did mini&s;ter the Things which are now Reported unto you by them that have preached the Go&s;pel unto you, with the holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from Hea|ven, which Things the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</Q></P>
<P>And as the greate&s;t Arguments made u&s;e of to the <HI>Jews,</HI> to prove that Chri&s;t was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> were taken from their Prophets, &s;o that the like Arguments might not be wanting through-out all the Times of the Chri&s;tian Church, St. <HI>John</HI> has left us,</P>
<P><Q><HI>The Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which God gave unto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. i. 1.</NOTE> to &s;hew unto his Servants the

<P><Q>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that Readeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> and they that Hear the Words of this Prophecy, and keep tho&s;e Things which are written therein, for the Time is at hand.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Prophecy</HI> appears chiefly to be contain'd within <HI>A Book written within,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. V. 1.7.</NOTE> <HI>and on the back|&s;ide, Sealed with &s;even Seals,</HI> which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amb&mdash; <HI>took out of the Right Hand of Him that &s;ate upon the Torone,</HI> and <HI>Opened</HI> the &s;everal <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">als</HI> one after another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. vi. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12. ch. viii. 1.</NOTE> who&s;e Contents compared with Hi&s;tory, will be found to de&s;cribe all that was to come to pa&s;s in the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> after the Time of St. <HI>John</HI>'s writing, which was about ninty five years after Chri&s;ts Birth.</P>
<P>This is, in all appearance, the &s;ame Book, in which <HI>Daniel</HI> is ordered <HI>To shut up the Words,</HI> and <HI>Seal the Book,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 4.</NOTE> <HI>even to the Time of the End,</HI> when it was to be further Explained by St. <HI>John,</HI> and Un&s;ealed, in order of Time, as the Events
<PB N="7" REF="002509_0009_0FDB6610E5742668">were to happen, which are the only compleat Interpreters of Prophecy, According to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. i. 20.</NOTE> <HI>That no Prophecy of the Scripture is its own Interpreter</HI> (as it ought to be rendeed, and not as in the <HI>English</HI> Tran&s;lation, <HI>Of private Interpretation.</HI>)</P>
<P>If therefore that <HI>Time of the End</HI> is not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ady come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan xii. 9.</NOTE> it is in vain to attempt any Explanation of the Periods mentioned in this Chapter of <HI>Daniel, for the Words are clo&s;ed up, and &s;ealed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. xii. 9,</NOTE> <HI>till the Time of the End.</HI> <Q>But when that <HI>Time</HI> comes <HI>Many shall be Purifyed and made White,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> <HI>and Tryed, but the Wicked shall do Wickedly, and none of the Wicked shall Under&s;tand, but the Wi&s;e shall Under&s;tand:</HI></Q> So that as cer|tainly as the Prophecy ought to be ob&s;cure till that <HI>Time,</HI> it ought to be plain after it is come, to tho&s;e who are meant by the <HI>Wi&s;e.</HI> And if it can be &s;hewn what tho&s;e Events are which the Prophecy referrs to, and that they are already happened, in order as they are de&s;cribed by <HI>Daniel,</HI> and Explained by St. <HI>John:</HI> Then it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the <HI>Time</HI> is come, and that
<PB N="8" REF="002509_0010_0FDB6611CE27CB68"><HI>tho&s;e who will not under&s;tand are Wicked,</HI> that is, engaged in intere&s;t to Oppo&s;e the Truth, and will de&s;erve to have that applyed to them which our Saviour, on a like occa&s;ion, &s;ays of the Pha|ri&s;ees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xvi. 3.</NOTE> <HI>O ye Hypocrites, ye can di&s;cern the face of the Sky, but can ye not di&s;cern the Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>By which charge of <HI>Hypocri&s;ie,</HI> our Saviour did not mean, that the Phari&s;ees knew him, and yet denyed him again&s;t their Con&s;cience; for he ob&s;erves, That they <HI>did not di&s;cern the Times,</HI> that is, did not know him, and yet this was an <HI>Hypocri&s;ie,</HI> tho' they were not &s;en&s;ible of it; for their Power and Advantage blinded them &s;o, that they deceived them&s;elves, and oppo&s;ed his Doctrine out of <HI>Hypocri&s;ie</HI> or guilty Prejudice.</P>
<P>The Application of this to <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Di&s;tinction, will not be difficult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim iii. v. 15.</NOTE> when it comes to be &s;hewn, that it relates to a <HI>Time</HI> when the World was to be divided into Two great Contending Parties, One of which would adhere to the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and therefore are called <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation;</HI> and the other Party would adhere to that Cau&s;e

<P>Now to make the&s;e things plainer by a parti|cular Enquiry, I &s;hall compare &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture with one another, and with the Remarkable Events in Hi&s;tory, and &s;ubmit it to the Reader, Whether the &s;tudy of Scripture Prophecy de&s;erves the Neglect or Prejudice it generally meets with in the World; or, Whe|ther it is not far more rea&s;onable, as well as more becoming Chri&s;tians in Profe&s;&s;ion, to follow St. <HI>John</HI>'s Advice.</P>

<P><Q>The <HI>Chaldeans</HI> an&s;wered before the King, and &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> there is not a Man upon the Earth

<P><Q>And it is a rare thing that the King requireth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> and there is none other that can &s;hew it before the King, except the Gods who&s;e dwelling is not with Fle&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>By all this Di&s;cour&s;e it is plain that <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar</HI> believed that the&s;e <HI>Wi&s;e Men,</HI> &amp;c. had a &s;upernatural Art,. and if they had, he argued ju&s;tly, that they could as well tell him the <HI>Dream,</HI> as the certain Interpretation or <HI>Accomplishment.</HI></P>
<P>But whether the <HI>Wi&s;e Men</HI> pretended to this &s;upernatural Art till now that they were forced to own the contrary, or whether they were only Men of Learning, and it was the &s;uper&s;tition of the People, and not their own Preten&s;ions, that made them pa&s;s for <HI>Conjurors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>However that was, They were, it &s;eems, obliged upon this occa&s;ion to undeceive <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="002509_0045_0FDB6665CDA729B8">and accordingly they gave him an An&s;wer that di&s;own'd any &s;upernatural Art in them&s;elves, and allowed that none but the Gods could An&s;wer &s;uch a Que&s;tion as the Kings, which Gods they did not pretend <HI>dwelt with Flesh,</HI> that is, in&s;pired them.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore, that all that they now pretended to, was to be skilled in that figurative Language, which had been u&s;ually employed in true Prophetical Revelations, and &s;o could without any in&s;piration explain the importance of the Terms, and put the matter into Words commonly u&s;ed and ea&s;ily apprehended.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner it &s;eems to have been that the <HI>Magicians</HI> in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Court imployed their Art and Skill to impo&s;e upon him, as far as Jugling Tricks would go. But where their Tricks failed them, they cryed out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. VIII. 19</NOTE> <HI>This is the Finger of God.</HI> By which they gave up all Pretence to being them&s;elves Divinely In&s;pi|red.</P>
<P>But <HI>Daniel</HI> when he was brought before the King, gave him a proof or a <HI>Sign,</HI> that what
<PB N="44" REF="002509_0046_0FDB6668189C4330">he was going to explain, would really come to pa&s;s, &s;ince he told him what no Body could know but God and the King him&s;elf, when he was reminded of his Dream.</P>
<P><Q>The King an&s;wered and &s;aid to <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 26,</NOTE> who&s;e name was <HI>Belteshazzar,</HI> Art thou able to make known unto me the Dream which I have &s;een, and the Interpretation thereof?</Q></P>

<P><Q>But there is a God in Heaven that revealeth Secrets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28,</NOTE> and maketh known to the King <HI>Ne|buchadnezzar,</HI> what &s;hall be in the latter Days.&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>Where <HI>Daniel</HI> gives two Rea&s;ons why God has in&s;tructed him in the <HI>Kings Matter,</HI> one that he might be inclined to deal favourably with the <HI>Jews</HI> now in Captivity, and the other that he might be well a&s;&s;ured that what he was warned of in a Dream, would certainly come to pa&s;s, and was not a common Dream.</P>

<P>Which placed him in the &s;tead of <HI>the Gods</HI> for that Time, and &s;hews, that it was the Practice of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to treat their Princes as <HI>Gods,</HI> while they were alive. In like manner, <HI>Alexander</HI> made him&s;elf be Wor&s;hipped as the Son of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> and the <HI>Roman Empe|rours Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Domitian,</HI> while alive, were called <HI>Davi</HI> or <HI>Gods;</HI> And it grew a Cu&s;tom after the <HI>Antonines,</HI> to adore the Emperours Pictures, which were fixed on the Standards of

<P>And thus it appears, that the <HI>Great Idol</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> was very properly u&s;ed as a Repre&s;en|tation of the Grand Impo&s;ture under living Princes, who were Wor&s;hipped as Gods, which was to continue to deceive the whole World from <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Time forward; and which St. <HI>John</HI> Expre&s;&s;es in another Figure, Repre&s;enting only what was to come after his Time, by</P>

<P>The de&s;ign of this is plainly to &s;hew, that the di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters of the &s;everal Mona|chies &s;hould Continue during the whole Period; and in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev.

<P>The Overturning the <HI>Heathen Roman Empire</HI> by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> is the Period whence we reckon its End, and yet it had a Revival, in <HI>Julian,</HI> &s;everal years after, which la&s;ted till, on <HI>Julian</HI>'s Death, it finally Peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Popes</HI> in <HI>England</HI> was taken away by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. and thence we reckon its Fall, tho' it had a dangerous Revival in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, but was quite Extirpated upon her Death.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Germany,</HI> when the <HI>Reformation</HI> fir&s;t began, and the <HI>Smalkaldick</HI> League was at its height, we reckon the <HI>Papal Power</HI> received its Deci&s;ive Stroke among tho&s;e Princes and Cities who imbraced the <HI>Reformation;</HI> tho' afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> the V. had Impri&s;oned &s;ome, Deprived others, and well nigh Extingui&s;hed the Party, till
