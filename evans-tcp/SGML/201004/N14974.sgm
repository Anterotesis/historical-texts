<HEAD>TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope my collecting in one volume, the following Orations, which were fir&s;t &s;eve|rally printed at your reque&s;t, but many of which have been long &s;ince not to be purcha&s;ed, will be con&s;idered in the mild light of an at|tempt to plea&s;e the Public.</P>
<P>Americans have been reprehended for not pre&s;erving, with &s;ufficient care, the various pamphlets and political tracts which this coun|try has afforded during the late war.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e productions which appear trite to us who live on the &s;pet where they grew, may, however, be con&s;idered as &s;ources of curi|o&s;ity to &s;trangers. Many of the&s;e Orations have been con&s;idered as the &s;entiments of this me|tropolis, from time to time, touching the re|volution,

<P>As the in&s;titution of an Oration upon the Eifth of March is now &s;uper&s;eded by the celebration of the anniver&s;ary of Independence upon the Fourth of July, I have given to this volume a general title, which will apply to both in&s;titutions: &s;o that if hereafter there &s;hall be a like volume, containing the Orations of that anniver&s;ary, this may be con&s;idered the fir&s;t and that the &s;econd volume of Bo&s;ton Orations.</P>

<P>YOUR de&s;ign in the appointment of this ceremony, <HI>my Friends and Fellow-Town&s;men,</HI> cannot fail to be examined in quite different lights at this &s;ea&s;on of political di&s;&s;ention. From the principles I profe&s;s, and in the ex|erci&s;e of my common right to judge with others, I con|clude it was <HI>decent, wi&s;e, and honorable.</HI></P>
<P>THE certainty of being favoured with your kinde&s;t partiality and candor, in a poor attempt to execute the part to which you have invited me, has overcome the ob|jection of my inability to perform it in a proper manner; and I now beg the favour of your animating countenance.</P>
<P>THE horrid bloody &s;cene we here commemorate, what|ever were the cau&s;es which concurred to bring it on that dreadful night, mu&s;t lead the pious and humane, of every order, to &s;ome &s;uitable reflections. The pious will adore
<PB N="8" REF="018997_0006_0FA9127F0DCA0398">the conduct of that BEING who is un&s;earchable in all his ways, and without who&s;e knowledge not a &s;ingle &s;parrow falls, in permitting an immortal &s;oul to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rried by the flying ball, the me&s;&s;enger of death, in the twinkling of an eye, to meet the awful Judge of all its &s;ecret actions. The humane, from having often thought, with plea&s;ing rapture, on the endearing &s;cenes of &s;ocial life, in all its amiable relations, will lament, with heart-felt pangs, their &s;udden di&s;&s;olution, by indi&s;cretion, rage and vengeance.</P>
<P>BUT let us leave that &s;hocking clo&s;e of one continued cour&s;e of rancor and di&s;pute, from the fir&s;t moment that the troops arrived in town: that cour&s;e will now be re|pre&s;ented by your own reflections to much more &s;olid, u&s;e|ful purpo&s;e, than by any artful language. I hope, how|ever, that heaven has yet in &s;tore &s;uch happine&s;s for this afflicted town and province, as will in time wear out the memory of all your former troubles.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely rejoice with you in the happy event of your &s;teady and united effort to prevent a &s;econd tragedy.</P>
<P>OUR fathers left their native land, ri&s;qued all the dan|gers of the &s;ea, and came to this then-&s;avage de&s;art, with that true undaunted courage which is excited by a con|fidence in GOD. They came that they might here enjoy them&s;elves, and leave to their po&s;terity the be&s;t of earthly portions, full <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty.</HI> You &s;howed upon the alarming cau&s;e for tryal, that their brave &s;pirit &s;till exi&s;ts in vigor, though their legacy of right is much impaired. The &s;ympathy and active friend&s;hip of &s;ome neighbour|ing towns, upon that &s;ad occa&s;ion, commands the highe&s;t gratitude of this.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een and felt the ill effects of placing &s;tand|ing forces in the mid&s;t of <HI>populous</HI> communities; but tho&s;e are only what individuals &s;uffer. Your vote directs me to
<PB N="9" REF="018997_0007_0FA9127FCC637A70">point out the fatal tendency of placing &s;uch an order in <HI>free</HI> cities&mdash;fatal indeed! <HI>Athens</HI> once was free; a citizen, a favorite of the people, by an artful &s;tory, gained a tri|fling guard of fifty men; ambition taught him ways to enlarge that number; he de&s;troyed the commonwealth and made him&s;elf the tyrant of the <HI>Athenians. Cae&s;ar,</HI> by the length of his command in <HI>Gaul,</HI> got the affections of his army, marched to <HI>Rome,</HI> overthrew the &s;tate, and made him&s;elf perpetual dictator. By the &s;ame in&s;truments, many le&s;s republics have been made to fall a prey to the devouring jaws of tyrants.&mdash;But this is a &s;ubject which &s;hould never be di&s;gui&s;ed with figures; it chu&s;es the plain &s;tile of di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>THE true &s;trength and &s;afety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy, is the bravery of its freeholders, its militia. By brave militias they ri&s;e to grandeur, and they come to ruin by a mercenary army. This is founded on hi&s;torical facts, and the &s;ame cau&s;es will, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, forever produce the &s;ame effects. Ju&s;tice <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> in his inimitably clear commentaries, tells us, that "it is extremely dangerous in a land of liberty, to make a di&s;tinct order of the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; that &s;uch an order is an object of jealou&s;y; and that <HI>the lows and con&s;titution of England are &s;trangers to it.</HI>" One article of the Bill of Rights is, that the rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tand|ing army within the kingdom in a time of peace, unle&s;s it be with con&s;ent of parliament, is again&s;t law. The pre&s;ent army, therefore, though called the peace <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,</HI> is kept up by one act, and governed by another; both of which expire <HI>annually.</HI> This circum&s;tance is va|lued as a &s;ufficient <HI>check</HI> upon the army. A le&s;s body of troops than is now maintained has, on a time, de&s;troyed a King, and fought under a parliament with great &s;ucce&s;s and glory; but, upon a motion to di&s;band them, they turned their ma&s;ters out of doors, and fixed others in their &s;tead. Such wild things are not again to happen,
<PB N="10" REF="018997_0008_0FA91280C0A60018">becau&s;e the parliament have power to &s;top payment once a year: but <HI>arma tenenti quis neget?</HI> which may be ea&s;ily interpreted, "who will bind <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> with his locks on
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trenchard.</NOTE>?"</P>
<P>THE bill which regulates the army, the &s;ame fine au|thor I have mentioned, &s;ays, "is, <HI>in many re&s;pects, ha&s;tily penned,</HI> and reduces the &s;oldier to a &s;tate of &s;lavery in the mid&s;t of a free nation. This is impolitic: for &s;laves envy the freedom of others, and take a malicious plea&s;ure in contributing to de&s;troy it."</P>
<P>BY this &s;candalous bill a ju&s;tice of peace is empowered to grant, <HI>without a previous oath</HI> from the military officer, a warrant to break open any (freeman's) hou&s;e, upon <HI>pretence</HI> of &s;earching for de&s;erters.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit to mention one more bad tendency: 'tis this,&mdash;a &s;tanding force leads to a total neglect of militias, or tends greatly to di&s;courage them.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee the danger of a &s;tanding army to the cau&s;e of freedom. If the <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;h</HI> parliament con&s;ents from year to year to be expo&s;ed, it doubtle&s;s has good rea&s;ons. But when did <HI>our</HI> a&s;&s;embly pa&s;s an act to hazard all the property, the liberty and lives of their con&s;tituents? what check have <HI>we</HI> upon a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> army? can <HI>we</HI> di&s;band it? can <HI>we</HI> &s;top its pay?</P>
<P>OUR own a&s;&s;emblies in <HI>America</HI> can rai&s;e an army; and <HI>our</HI> Monarch, George the 3d, by our con&s;titution, take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> immediate command.

<P>WHERE, in the ca&s;e I have &s;tated, would be the value of the boa&s;ted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution?</P>
<P>WHO are a free people? not tho&s;e who do not &s;uffer actual oppre&s;&s;ion; but tho&s;e who have a <HI>con&s;titutional check upon the power</HI> to oppre&s;s.</P>
<P>WE are &s;laves or freemen: if, as we are called, the la&s;t, where is our check upon the following powers, <HI>France, Spain,</HI> the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> or <HI>the Briti&s;h Parliaments?</HI> now if any one of the&s;e (and it is quite immaterial which) has right to make the two acts in que&s;tion operate with|in this province, they have right to give us up to an unlimited army, under the &s;ole direction of one <HI>Saracen</HI> commander.</P>
<P>THUS I have led your thoughts to <HI>that</HI> upon which I formed my conclu&s;ion, that the de&s;ign of this ceremony was <HI>decent, wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>honorable.</HI> Make the bloody 5th of <HI>March</HI> the Aera of the re&s;urrection of your birthrights, which have been murdered by the very &s;trength that nur&s;ed them in their infancy. I had an eye <HI>&s;olely</HI> to par|liamentary &s;upremacy; and I hope you will think every other view beneath your notice, in our pre&s;ent mo&s;t alarm|ing &s;ituation.</P>

That mote, we think, is nothing but <HI>our obligation to England fir&s;t, and afterwards Great-Britain, for con&s;tant kind protection of our lives and birthrights again&s;t foreign danger.</HI> We all acknowledge that protection.</P>
<P>LET us once more look into the early hi&s;tory of this province. We find that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ance&s;tors, di&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted in their native country at a <HI>Legi&s;lation,</HI> which they &s;aw was &s;acrificing all their rights, <HI>left its Juri&s;diction</HI>

<BIBL>CIC.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, and &s;ought, like wandering birds of pa&s;&s;age, &s;ome happier cli|mate. Here at length they &s;ettled down. The King of <HI>England</HI> was &s;aid to be the royal

<PB N="13" REF="018997_0011_0FA91282CD18C0B0">by which the price of tenure, and the <HI>rules of ma|nagement,</HI> were fairly &s;tated. It is in this compact that we find OUR ONLY TRUE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.</P>
<P>I MIGHT here enlarge upon the character of tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;ettlers, men of whom the world was little worthy; who, for a long cour&s;e of years, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by no earthly power, defended their liberty, their religion, and their lives, again&s;t the greate&s;t inland danger of the &s;avage natives: but this falls not within my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. They were &s;ecure by &s;ea.</P>
<P>IN our infancy, when not an over-tempting jewel for the <HI>Bourbon</HI> Crown, the very <HI>name</HI> of England &s;aved us; afterwards her <HI>fleets and armies.</HI> We wi&s;h not to depre|ciate the worth of that protection. Of our gold, yea of our mo&s;t fine gold, we will freely <HI>give</HI> a part. Our fa|thers would have done the &s;ame. But mu&s;t we fall down and cry "let not a &s;tranger rob and kill me, O my father! let me rather die by the hand of my brother, and let him <HI>ravi&s;h</HI> all my portion
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a vitam corpu&s;que &s;ervato, ita fortunas, ita rem famil arem, ut haec po&s;teriora <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ertati ducas,&mdash;nec pro his libertatem, &s;ed pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> libertati haec projicias, tanquam pignora injuriae.</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid that di&s;united from <HI>Britain</HI> "we &s;hould bleed at every vein." I cannot &s;ee the con&s;equence. The <HI>States of Holland</HI> do not &s;uffer thus. But grant it true, SENECA, would prefer the LAUNCETS of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or any other power, to the Bow-STRING, though ap|plied by the fair hand of <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P>THE declarative vote of the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> is the death-warrant of <HI>our</HI> birthrights, and wants only a Czar|i&s;h King to put it into execution. <HI>Here</HI> then a door of &s;al|vation is open. <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may rai&s;e <HI>her</HI> fleets and
<PB N="14" REF="018997_0012_0FA912839CBA4750">armies, but it is only <HI>our own King</HI> that can direct their fire down upon our heads. He is gracious, but not om|ni&s;cient. He is ready to hear our APPEALS in their proper cour&s;e; and knowing him&s;elf, though the mo&s;t powerful prince on earth, yet, a &s;ubject under a divine con&s;titution of LAW; that law he <HI>will</HI> a&s;k and receive from the twelve Judges of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e will prove that the claim of the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> over <HI>us</HI> is not only ILLE|GAL IN ITSELF, but A DOWN-RIGHT USURPATION OF HIS PREROGATIVE as King of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>A BRAVE nation is always generous. Let us appeal, therefore, at the &s;ame time, to the genero&s;ity of the PEO|PLE of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> before the tribunal
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not think the <HI>QUO WARRANTO</HI> again&s;t our fir&s;t charter, was tried in a proper court.</NOTE> of <HI>Europe,</HI> not to envy <HI>us</HI> the full enjoyment of the RIGHTS OF BRE|THREN.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>my Friends and Fellow-Town&s;men,</HI> having declared my&s;elf an <HI>American</HI> Son of Liberty of true char|ter principles: having &s;hewn the critical and dangerous &s;ituation of our birthrights, and the true cour&s;e for &s;peedy redre&s;s; I &s;hall take the freedom to recommend, with boldne&s;s, one previous &s;tep.&mdash;Let us &s;how we under&s;tand the true value of what we are claiming.</P>
<P>THE patriotic <HI>Farmer</HI> tells us, "the cau&s;e of Liberty is a cau&s;e of too much dignity to be &s;ullied by turbulence and tumult.&mdash;Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and re&s;pectful be|haviour, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incu|rable rage. In quarrels&mdash;ri&s;en to a certain height, the fir&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention is no longer remembered, the minds
<PB N="15" REF="018997_0013_0FA912846E06CE70">of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and re&s;enting the mutual expre&s;&s;ions of their di&s;like. When feuds have reached that fatal point, con&s;iderations of rea|&s;on and equity vani&s;h; and a blind fury governs, or ra|ther confounds all things. A people no longer regard their intere&s;t, but a gratification of their wrath."</P>
<P>WE know our&s;elves &s;ubjects of common LAW: to <HI>that</HI> and the worthy <HI>executors</HI> of it, let us pay a &s;teady and con&s;cientious regard. Pa&s;t errors in this point have been written with gall, by the pen of MALICE. May our future conduct be &s;uch as to make even that vile IMP lay her pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;ide.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Right</HI> which impo&s;es <HI>duties</HI> upon us, is in di&s;pute: but whether they are managed by a <HI>Surveyor-General,</HI> a <HI>Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, Turki&s;h Janizaries,</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Co&s;|&s;acks,</HI> let them enjoy, during our time of fair tryal, the common per&s;onal protection of the laws of our con&s;titution. Let us &s;hut our eyes, for the pre&s;ent, to their being <HI>ex|ecutors of claims &s;ubver&s;ive of our rights.</HI></P>
<P>WATCHFUL, hawk-eyed JEALOUSY, ever guards the portal of the temple of the GODDESS LIBERTY. This is known to tho&s;e who frequent her altars. Our whole conduct therefore, I am &s;ure, will meet with the utmo&s;t candor of her VOTARIES: but I am wi&s;hing we may be able to convert even her ba&s;e&s;t APOSTATES.</P>
<P>WE are SLAVES until we obtain &s;uch <HI>redre&s;s,</HI> through the ju&s;tice of our King, as our happy <HI>con&s;titution leads us to expect.</HI> In that condition, let us behave with the pro|priety and dignity of FREEMEN; and <HI>thus</HI> exhibit to the world, a new character of a people, which no hi&s;tory de|&s;cribes.</P>

<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> noble attachment to a free con&s;titution, which rai&s;ed ancient Rome from the &s;malle&s;t beginnings, to that bright &s;ummit of happine&s;s and glory to which &s;he arrived; and it was the lo&s;s of <HI>this</HI> which plunged her from <HI>that</HI> &s;ummit, into the black gulph of infamy and &s;la|very.

<PB N="19" REF="018997_0017_0FA91288C2BC0708">whereby the &s;treets of imperial Rome were drenched with her <HI>noble&s;t</HI> blood.

<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> attachment to a con&s;titution, founded on free and benevolent principles, which in&s;pired the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country:&mdash;they &s;aw with grief the daring outrages committed on the free con&s;titution of their native land&mdash;they knew that nothing but a civil war could at that time re&s;tore its pri&s;tine purity. So hard was it to re&s;olve to embrue their hands in the <HI>blood</HI> of their brethren, that they cho&s;e rather to quit their fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;eek another habitation in a di&s;tant clime. When they came to this new world, which they fairly purcha&s;ed of the Indian natives, the only rightful proprietors, they cul|tivated the then barren &s;oil, by their ince&s;&s;ant labour, and defended their dear-bought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with the forti|tude of the chri&s;tian, and the bravery of the hero.</P>
<P>AFTER various &s;truggles, which, during the tyrannic reigns of the hou&s;e of STUART, were con&s;tantly kept up between right and wrong, between liberty and &s;lavery, the connection between Great-Britain and this Colony, was &s;ettled in the reign of King William and Queen Ma|ry, by a compact, the conditions of which were expre&s;&s;ed in a Charter; by which all the liberties and immunities of Briti&s;h Subjects, were confined to this province, as fully and as ab&s;olutely as they po&s;&s;ibly could be by any human in&s;trument which can be devi&s;ed. And it is un|deniably true, that the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important right of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject is, that <HI>he &s;hall be governed by no laws but tho&s;e to which he either in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative
<PB N="20" REF="018997_0018_0FA9128999BBB908">hath given his con&s;ent:</HI> and this I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, is the grand ba&s;is of Briti&s;h freedom; it is interwoven with the con&s;titution; and whenever this is lo&s;t, the con&s;titu|tion mu&s;t be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Briti&s;h con&s;titution</HI> (of which ours is a copy) is a happy compound of the three forms (under &s;ome of which all governments may be ranged) viz. monarchy, ari&s;to|cracy, and democracy: of the&s;e three the <HI>Briti&s;h Legi&s;|lature</HI> is compo&s;ed, and without the con&s;ent of each branch, nothing can carry with it the force of a law; but when a law is to be pa&s;&s;ed for ra&s;ing a tax, that law can origi|nate only in the democratic branch, which is the Hou&s;e of Commons in Britain, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives here&mdash;The rea&s;on is obvious: they and their con&s;ti|tuants are to pay much the large&s;t part of it; but as the ari&s;trocratic branch, which in Britain, is the hou&s;e of lords, and in this province, the council, are al&s;o to pay &s;ome part, THEIR con&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary; and as the mo|narchic branch, which in Britain is the King, and with us, either the King in per&s;on, or the Governor whom he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to appoint to act in his &s;tead, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own intere&s;t, which is <HI>that</HI> of all the &s;ubjects in general, HIS con&s;ent is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and when the con&s;ent of the&s;e three branches is obtained, the taxation is mo&s;t certainly legal.</P>
<P>LET us now allow our&s;elves a few moments to examine the <HI>late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for taxing America</HI>&mdash; Let us with candor judge whether they are con&s;titution|ally binding upon us:&mdash;if they are, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE let us &s;ubmit to them, without one murmuring word.</P>
<P>FIRST, I would a&s;k whether the members of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons are the democracy of this province? if they are, they are either the people of this province,
<PB N="21" REF="018997_0019_0FA9128A58999798">or are elected by the people of this province, to repre&s;ent them, and have therefore a con&s;titutional right to origi|nate a bill for taxing them: it is mo&s;t certain they are neither; and therefore nothing done by <HI>them</HI> can be &s;aid to be done by the democratic branch of our con&s;titution. I would next a&s;k, whether the Lords, who compo&s;e the ari&s;tocratic branch of the legi&s;lature, are Peers of Ameri|ca? I never heard it was (even in the&s;e extraordinary times) &s;o much as pretended, and if they are not, certain|ly no act of <HI>theirs</HI> can be &s;aid to be the act of the ari&s;tocratic branch of our con&s;titution. The power of the monarchic branch we with plea&s;ure acknowledge, re&s;ides in the King, who may act either in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative; and I freely confe&s;s that I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why a PRO|CLAMATION <HI>for rai&s;ing money in America,</HI> i&s;&s;ued by the King's <HI>&s;ole</HI> authority, would not be equally con&s;i&s;tent with our own con&s;titution, and therefore equally binding upon us with the <HI>late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for tax|ing us;</HI> for it is plain, that if there is any validity in <HI>tho&s;e acts,</HI> it mu&s;t ari&s;e altogether from the monarchical branch of the legi&s;lature: and I further think that it would be at lea&s;t as equitable; for I do not conceive it to be of the lea&s;t importance to us by <HI>whom</HI> our property is taken away, &s;o long as it is taken without our con&s;ent; and I am very much at a lo&s;s to know by what figure of rhetoric, the inhabitants of this province can be called FREE SUBJECTS, when they are obliged to obey implicit|ly, &s;uch laws as are made for them by men three thou&s;and miles off, whom they know not, and whom they never have empowered to act for them; or how they can be &s;aid to have PROPERTY, when a body of men, over whom they have not the lea&s;t controul, and who are not in any way accountable to them, &s;hall oblige them to deliver up any part, or the whole of their &s;ub&s;tance, without even a&s;king their con&s;ent: and yet, whoever pretends that the late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for taxing America ought to be deemed binding upon us, mu&s;t admit at once that
<PB N="22" REF="018997_0020_0FA9128C6B9F28F8">we are ab&s;olute SLAVES, and have no property of our own; or el&s;e that we may be FREEMEN, and at the &s;ame time under a nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the <HI>arbitrary commands of tho&s;e</HI> over whom we have no controul or influence; and that we may HAVE PROPERTY OF OUR OWN, which is entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of another. Such gro&s;s ab&s;urdi|ties, I believe will not be reli&s;hed in this enlightened age: and it can be no matter of wonder that the people quickly perceived, and &s;eriou&s;ly complained of the inroads which the&s;e acts mu&s;t unavoidably make upon their <HI>liberty,</HI> and of the hazard to which their <HI>whole property</HI> is by <HI>them</HI> expo&s;ed; for, if they may be taxed without their con&s;ent, even in the &s;malle&s;t trifle, they may al&s;o, without their con&s;ent, be deprived of every thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s, although never &s;o valuable, never &s;o dear. Certainly it never en|tered the hearts of our ance&s;tors, that after &s;o many dangers in this then de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, their hard-earned proper|ty &s;hould be at the di&s;po&s;al of the Briti&s;h parliament; and as it was &s;oon foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at this taxation could not be &s;up|ported by rea&s;on and argument, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary that one act of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be enforced by another, and therefore, contrary to our ju&s;t rights as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t having a ju&s;t title to po&s;&s;e&s;s, all the <HI>liberties</HI> and IMMUNITIES of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, a &s;tanding army was e&s;tabli&s;hed among us in a time of peace; and evidently for the purpo&s;e of effecting <HI>that,</HI> which it was one prin|cipal de&s;ign of the founders of the con&s;titution to prevent (when they declared a &s;tanding army in a time of peace to be AGAINST LAW) namely, for the enforce|ment of obedience to acts which, upon fair examination, appeared to be unju&s;t and uncon&s;titutional.</P>

<P>THE mi&s;eries of mankind thus proclaiming eternal war with their &s;pecies, led them, probably, to con&s;ult certain mea&s;ures to arre&s;t the current of &s;uch outrageous enormities.</P>
<P>A SENSE of their wants and weakne&s;s, in a &s;tate of na|ture, doubtle&s;s inclined them to &s;uch reciprocal aids and &s;upport, as eventually e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MEN then began to incorporate; &s;ubordination &s;uc|ceeded to independence; order to anarchy; and pa&s;&s;ions were di&s;armed by civilization: &s;ociety lent its aid to &s;e|cure the weak from oppre&s;&s;ion, who wi&s;ely took &s;helter within the &s;anctuary of law.</P>
<P>ENCREASING &s;ociety afterwards exacted, that the tacit contract made with her by each individual, at the time of his being incorporated, &s;hould receive a more &s;olemn form to become authentic and irrefragable; the main object being to add force to the laws, proportionate to the power and extent of the body corporate, who&s;e energy they were to direct.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>&s;ociety</HI> availed her&s;elf of the &s;acrifice of that <HI>li|berty</HI> and that <HI>natural equality</HI> of which we are all con|&s;cious: &s;uperiors and magi&s;trates were appointed, and mankind &s;ubmitted to a civil and political &s;ubordination.

ALTHOUGH unre&s;trained power in one per&s;on, may have been the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural recour&s;e of mankind, from rapine and di&s;order; yet all re&s;trictions of power, made by laws, or participation of &s;overeignty, are ap|parent improvements upon what began in unlimited power.</P>

<P>MANKIND apprized of their privileges, in being ra|tional and free, in pre&s;cribing civil laws to them&s;elves, had &s;urely no intention of being enchained by any of their equals; and although they &s;ubmitted voluntary adherents to certain laws, for the &s;ake of mutual &s;ecurity and hap|pine&s;s, they, no doubt, intended by the original compact, a permanent exemption of the &s;ubject body from any claims, which were not expre&s;ly &s;urrendered, for the par|po&s;e of obtaining the &s;ecurity and defence of the whole. Can it po&s;&s;ibly be conceived, that they would voluntarily be en&s;laved by a power of their own creation?</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of a magi&s;trate, does not therefore take away that lawful defence again&s;t force and injury, allowed by the law of nature; we are not to obey a prince, ruling above the limits of the power entru&s;ted to him; for the commonwealth, by con&s;tituting a head, does not deprive it&s;elf of the power of its own pre&s;ervation

<P>THE attentive gravity; the venerable appearance of this crouded audience; the dignity which I behold in the countenances of &s;o many in this great a&s;&s;embly; the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion upon which we have met together, joined to a con&s;ideration of the part I am to take in the important bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, fill me with an awe hitherto unknown; and heighten the &s;en&s;e which I have ever had, of my unworthine&s;s to fill this &s;acred de&s;k; but, allured by the call of &s;ome of my re&s;pected fellow-citizens, with who&s;e reque&s;t it is always my greate&s;t plea|&s;ure to comply, I almo&s;t forgot my want of ability to per|form what they required. In this &s;ituation I find my only &s;upport, in a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf that a generous people will not &s;everely cen&s;ure what they know was well in|tended, though its want of merit, &s;hould prevent their
<PB N="44" REF="018997_0041_0FA912A3EBB70A40">being able to applaud it. And I pray, that my &s;incere at|tachment to the intere&s;t of my country, and hearty dete&s;ta|tion of every de&s;ign formed again&s;t her liberties, may be ad|mitted as &s;ome apology for my appearance in this place.</P>
<P>I HAVE always, from my earlie&s;t youth, rejoiced in the felicity of my fellow-men; and have ever con&s;idered it as the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of every member of &s;ociety to pro|mote, as far as in him lies, the pro&s;perity of every in|dividual, but more e&s;pecially of the community to which he belongs; and al&s;o, as a faithful &s;ubject of the &s;tate, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to detect, and having detected, &s;trenuou&s;ly to oppo&s;e every traitorous plot which its ene|mies may devi&s;e for its de&s;truction. Security to the per|&s;ons and properties of the governed, is &s;o obviou&s;ly the de&s;ign and end of civil government, that to attempt a logical proof of it, would be like burning tapers at noon-day, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;un in enlightening the world; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable, to attempt to &s;upport a government, of which this is not the great and principal ba&s;is; and it is to the la&s;t degree vicious and infamous to attempt to &s;upport a government, which manife&s;tly tends to render the per&s;ons and properties of the governed in&s;ecure. Some boa&s;t of being <HI>friends to government;</HI> I am a friend to <HI>righteous</HI> government, to a government founded upon the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal enmity to tyran|ny. Is the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem which the Briti&s;h admini&s;tra|tion have adopted for the government of the colonies, a righteous government? or is it tyranny?&mdash;Here &s;uf|fer me to a&s;k (and would to heaven there could be an an&s;wer) what tenderne&s;s, what regard, re&s;pect or con&s;ideration has <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hewn, in their late tran&s;|actions, for the &s;ecurity of the per&s;ons or properties of the inhabitants of the colonies? or rather, what have they omitted doing to de&s;troy that &s;ecurity? they have dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared that they have, ever had, and of right ought ever
<PB N="45" REF="018997_0042_0FA912A49A877D18">to have, full power to make laws of &s;ufficient validity to bind the colonies in all ca&s;es whatever: they have exer|ci&s;ed this pretended right by impo&s;ing a tax upon us without our con&s;ent; and le&s;t we &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome re|luctance at parting with our property, her fleets and ar|mies are &s;ent to enforce their mad preten&s;ions. The town of Bo&s;ton, ever faithful to the Briti&s;h crown, has been inve&s;ted by a Briti&s;h fleet: the troops of George the III. have cro&s;s'd the wide atlantick, not to engage an enemy, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t a band of TRAITORS in trampling on the rights and liberties of his mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in Ame|rica,&mdash;tho&s;e rights and liberties which, as a father, he ought ever to regard, and as a king, he is bound, in honor, to defend from violations, even at the ri&s;que of his own life.</P>
<P>LET not the hi&s;tory of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick inform po&s;terity, that a king, de&s;cended from that glorious monarch George the II. once &s;ent his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to conquer and en&s;lave his &s;ubjects in America; but be perpetual infamy entail'd upon that villain who dared to advi&s;e his ma&s;ter to &s;uch execrable mea&s;ures; for it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the con&s;equences which &s;o naturally follow|ed upon &s;ending troops into America, to enforce obedience to acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, which neither GOD nor man ever empowered them to make. It was rea&s;onable to expect that troops, who knew the errand they were &s;ent upon, would treat the people whom they were to &s;ubjugate, with a cruelty and haughtine&s;s, which too often buries the honorable character of a <HI>&s;oldier,</HI> in the di&s;graceful name of an <HI>unfeeling ruffian.</HI> The troops, upon their fir&s;t ar|rival, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our &s;enate-hou&s;e, and pointed their cannon again&s;t the judgment-hall, and even continued them there whil&s;t the &s;upreme court of judicature for this province was actually &s;itting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the king's &s;ubjects. Our &s;treets nightly refounded with the noi&s;e of riot and debauchery; our peaceful citizens were hourly expo&s;ed to &s;hameful in&s;ults,
<PB N="46" REF="018997_0043_0FA912A53B176160">and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage.&mdash; But this was not all: as though they thought it not enough to violate our civil rights, they endeavoured to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges; to viciate our morals, and thereby render us de&s;erving of de&s;truction. Hence the rude din of arms which broke in upon your &s;o|lemn devotions in your temples, on that day hallowed by heaven, and &s;et apart by GOD him&s;elf for his peculiar wor&s;hip. Hence, impious oaths and bla&s;phemies &s;o often tortur'd your unaccu&s;tomed ear. Hence, all the arts which idlene&s;s and luxury could invent, were u&s;ed, to betray our youth of one &s;ex into extravagance and effeminacy, and of the other to infamy and ruin; and did they not &s;ucceed but too well? did not a reverence for religion &s;en&s;ibly de|cay? did not our infants almo&s;t learn to li&s;p out cur&s;es before they knew their horrid import? did not our youth forget they were Americans, and regardle&s;s of the admo|nitions of the wi&s;e and aged, &s;ervilely copy from their tyrants tho&s;e vices which finally mu&s;t overthrow the empire of Great-Britain? and mu&s;t I be compelled to acknow|ledge, that even the noble&s;t, faire&s;t part of all the lower creation did not entirely e&s;cape the cur&s;ed &s;nare? when virtue has once erected her throne within the female brea&s;t, it is upon &s;o &s;olid a ba&s;is that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant. But have there not been &s;ome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w indeed, I hope, who&s;e youth and inexperience have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nder'd them a prey to wretches, whom, upon the lea&s;t reflection, they would have de&s;pi&s;ed and hated as foes to GOD and their country? I fear there have been &s;ome &s;uch unhappy in&s;tances; or why have I &s;een an hone&s;t father cloathed with &s;hame; or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears?</P>
<P>BUT I forbear, and come reluctantly to the tran&s;actions of that di&s;mal night, when in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion we felt the extremes of grief, a&s;toni&s;hment and rage; when heaven in anger, for a dreadful moment, &s;uffer'd hell to take the
<PB N="47" REF="018997_0044_0FA912A6DA8F3D78">reins; when &s;atan with his cho&s;en band open'd the &s;luices of New-England's blood, and &s;acrilegiou&s;ly polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltle&s;s &s;ons. Let this &s;ad tale of death never be told without a tear: let not the heaving bo&s;om cea&s;e to burn with a manly indignation at the barbarous &s;tory, through the long tracts of future time: let every parent tell the &s;hameful &s;tory to his li&s;tening children 'til tears of pity gli&s;ten in their eyes, and boiling pa&s;&s;ion &s;hakes their tender frames; and whil&s;t the anni|ver&s;ary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandaemonium, let all America join in one com|mon prayer to heaven, that the inhuman, unprovoked mur|ders of the fifth of March, 1770, planned by Hill&s;bo|rough, and a knot of treacherous knaves in Bo&s;ton, and executed by the cruel hand of Pre&s;ton and his &s;anguinary coadjutors, may ever &s;tand on hi&s;tory without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, witheld the ready arm of ven|geance from executing in&s;tant ju&s;tice on the vile a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? perhaps you fear'd promi&s;cuous carnage might en&s;ue, and that the innocent might &s;hare the fate of tho&s;e who had performed the infernal deed. But were not all guilty? were you not too tender of the lives of tho&s;e who came to fix a yoke on your necks? but I mu&s;t not too &s;everely blame a fault, which great &s;ouls only can commit. May that magnificence of &s;pirit which &s;corns the low pur&s;uits of malice; may that generous compa&s;&s;ion which often pre|&s;erves from ruin, even a guilty villian, forever actuate the noble bo&s;oms of Americans!&mdash;But let not the mi&s;creant ho&s;t vainly imagine that we fear'd their arms. No; them we de&s;pis'd; we dread nothing but &s;lavery. Death is the creature of a poltroon's brains; 'tis immortality to &s;acri|fice our&s;elves for the &s;alvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale-faced moon, and the affrighted &s;tars that hurried through the &s;ky, can wit|ne&s;s that we fear not death. Our hearts, which at the re|collection, glow with a rage that four revolving years have &s;carcely taught us to re&s;train, can witne&s;s that we fear not
<PB N="48" REF="018997_0045_0FA912A9C1E25878">death; and happy 'tis for tho&s;e who dared to in&s;ult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an everla&s;ting monu|ment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s' bravery. But they retir'd, they fled, and in that flight they found their only &s;afety. We then expected that the hand of public ju&s;tice would &s;oon inflict that puni&s;hment upon the murderers, which, by the laws of GOD and man, they had incurred. But let the unbia&s;s'd pen of a Robert&s;on, or perhaps of &s;ome equally fam'd Ame|rican, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of &s;uc|ceeding generations. And though the murderers may e&s;cape the ju&s;t re&s;entment of an enraged people; though drow&s;y ju&s;tice, intoxicated by the poi&s;onous draught pre|pared for her cup, &s;till nods upon her rotten &s;eat, yet be a&s;&s;ured, &s;uch complicated crimes will meet their due re|ward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers! ye villains high and low! ye wretches who contrived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed! do you not feel the goads and &s;tings of con&s;cious guilt pierce through your &s;avage bo&s;oms? though &s;ome of you may think your&s;elves exalted to a height that bids defiance to the arms of hu|man ju&s;tice, and others &s;hroud your&s;elves beneath the ma&s;k of hypocracy, and build your hopes of &s;afety on the low arts of cunning, chicanery and fal&s;hood; yet, do you not &s;ometimes feel the knawings of that worm which never dies? do not the injured &s;hades of Maverick, Gray, Caldwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in your &s;olitary walks, arre&s;t you even in the mid&s;t of your debaucheries, and fill even your dreams with terror? but if the unap|pea&s;ed manes of the dead &s;hould not di&s;turb their mur|derers, yet &s;urely even your obdurate hearts mu&s;t &s;hrink, and your guilty blood mu&s;t chill within your rigid veins, when you behold the mi&s;erable Monk, the wretched victim of your &s;avage cruelty. Ob&s;erve his tottering knees which &s;carce &s;u&s;tain his wa&s;ted body; look on his hagga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d eyes; mark well the death-like palene&s;s on his fallen cheek, and tell me, does not the &s;ight plant daggers in your &s;ouls?

<P>FOR us he bled, and now langui&s;hes. The wounds by which he is tortur'd to a lingering death, were aimed at our country! &s;urely the meek-eyed charity can never be|hold &s;uch &s;ufferings with indifference.

<P>PATRIOTISM is ever united with humanity and com|pa&s;&s;ion.

Thoroughly per&s;uaded of this, I need not add a word to engage your compa&s;&s;ion and bounty towards a fellow-citizen, who, with long protracted angui&s;h, falls a victim to the relentle&s;s rage of our com|mon enemies.</P>

<P>BUT I gladly quit the gloomy theme of death, and leave you to improve the thought of that important day, when our naked &s;ouls mu&s;t &s;tand before that Being, from whom nothing can be hid. I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects which have already followed from quartering reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar troops in this town: let our misfor|tunes teach po&s;terity to guard again&s;t &s;uch evils for the future. Standing armies are &s;ometimes (I would by no means &s;ay generally, much le&s;s univer&s;ally) compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who have rendered them&s;elves unfit to live in ci|vil &s;ociety; who have no other motives of conduct than tho&s;e which a de&s;ire of the pre&s;ent gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions &s;ugge&s;ts; who have no property in any country; men who have lo&s;t or given up their own liberties, and envy tho&s;e who enjoy liberty; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Lewis; who for the addition of one penny a day to their wages, would de&s;ert from the chri&s;tian cro&s;s, and fight under the cre&s;cent of the Turk|i&s;h Sultan; from &s;uch men as the&s;e, what has not a &s;tate to fear? with &s;uch as the&s;e, u&s;urping Cae&s;ar pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon; with &s;uch as the&s;e he humbled mighty Rome, and forced the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world to own a ma&s;ter in a traitor. The&s;e are the men whom &s;ceptered robbers now employ to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of GOD, and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indi&s;crimi|nately upon his creatures. By the&s;e the mi&s;erable &s;laves in Turkey, Per&s;ia, and many other exten&s;ive countries, are rendered truly wretched, though their air is &s;alubri|ous, and their &s;oil l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">riou&s;ly fertile.

You now know the &s;erpents who, whil&s;t cheri&s;hed in your bo&s;oms, were darting their invenom'd &s;tings into the vitals of the con&s;titution. But the repre&s;entatives of the people have fixed a mark on tho&s;e ungrateful mon&s;ters, which, though it may not make them &s;o &s;ecure as Cain of old, yet renders them at lea&s;t as infamous.

<P>TRUE it is, that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try have annexed a &s;alary to the office of the governor of this province, to be paid out of a revenue, rai&s;ed in America, without our con&s;ent. They have attempted to render our courts of ju&s;tice the in&s;truments of extending the autho|rity of acts of the Briti&s;h parliament over this colony, by making the judges dependent on the Briti&s;h admini&s;trati|on, for their &s;upport. But this people will never be en&s;la|ved with their eyes open. The moment they knew that the governor was not &s;uch a governor as the charter of the province points out, he lo&s;t his power of hurting them. They were al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmed; they &s;u&s;pected him, have guarded a|gain&s;t him, and he has found that a wife and a brave peo|ple, when they know their danger, are fruitful in expedi|ents to e&s;cape it.</P>

THAT per&s;onal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property, or an exclu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of what he has hone&s;tly acquired by his own labour, nece&s;|&s;arily ari&s;es therefrom, are truths which common &s;en&s;e has placed beyond the reach of contradiction. And no man, or body of men, can, without being guilty of flagrant inju&s;tice, claim a right to di&s;po&s;e of the per&s;ons of acqui&s;itions of any other man or body of men, unle&s;s it can be proved that &s;uch a right has ari&s;en from &s;ome compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly and freely granted.</P>
<P>IF I may be indulged in taking a retro&s;pective view of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of our country, it will be ea&s;y to de|termine with what degree of ju&s;tice the late parliament of Great-Britain have a&s;&s;umed the power of giving away <HI>that property</HI> which the Americans have earned by their labour.</P>
<P>OUR fathers having nobly re&s;olved never to wear the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;eeing the European world, at that time, through indolence and cowardice, falling a prey to tyranny, bravely threw them&s;elves upon the bo&s;om of the ocean; determined to find a place in which they might enjoy their freedom, or peri&s;h in the glorious attempt. Approving heaven beheld the favourite ark dancing upon the waves, and graciou&s;ly pre&s;erved it until the cho&s;en families were brought in &s;afety to the&s;e we&s;tern regions. They found the land &s;warming with &s;avages, who threat|ened death with every kind of torture. But &s;avages, and death with torture, were far le&s;s terrible than &s;lavery: nothing was &s;o much the object of their abhorrence as a tyrant's power: they knew that it was more &s;afe to dwell with man in his mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed &s;tate, than in a country where arbitrary power prevails. Even <HI>anarchy it&s;elf,</HI> that bugbear held up by the tools of power (though truly to be deprecated) is infinitely le&s;s dangerous to mankind than <HI>arbitrary government.

<P>THIS country, having been di&s;covered by an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, in the year 1630, was (according to the &s;y&s;tem which the blind &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e time &s;upported) deem|ed the property of the crown of England. Our ance&s;tors, when they re&s;olved to quit their native &s;oil, obtained from King James, a grant of certain lands in North-America. This they probably did to &s;ilence the cavils of their ene|mies, for it cannot be doubted, but they de&s;pi&s;ed the pre|tended right which he claimed thereto.

<PB N="60" REF="018997_0057_0FA912BD3B595430">they therefore entered into a treaty with the natives, and bought from them the lands: nor have I ever yet obtained any information that our ance&s;tors ever pleaded, or that the natives ever regarded the grant from the Engli&s;h crown: the bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties in the &s;ame independent manner that it would have been, had neither of them ever known or heard of the i&s;land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>HAVING become the hone&s;t proprietors of the &s;oil, they immediately applied them&s;elves to the cultivation of it; and they &s;oon beheld the virgin earth teeming with riche&s;t fruits, a grateful recompence for their unwearied toil. The fields began to wave with repining harve&s;ts, and the late barren wilderne&s;s was &s;een to blo&s;&s;om like the ro&s;e. The &s;avage natives &s;aw with wonder the delightful change, and quickly formed a &s;cheme to obtain <HI>that</HI> by fraud or force, <HI>which</HI> nature meant as the reward of indu&s;try alone. But the illu&s;trious emigrants &s;oon convinced the rude invaders, that they were not le&s;s ready to take the field for battle than for labor; and the in&s;idious foe was driven from their borders as often as he ventured to di&s;turb them. The crown of England looked with indifference on the conte&s;t; our ance&s;tors were left alone to combat with the natives.

And it ap|pears plainly, from the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, that neither the prince, nor the people of England, thought them&s;elves much intere&s;ted in the matter. They had not then any idea of a thou&s;andth part of tho&s;e advantages which they &s;ince <HI>have,</HI> and we are mo&s;t heartily willing they &s;hould <HI>&s;till continue</HI> to reap from us.</P>

By an intercour&s;e of friendly offices, the two countries be|came &s;o united in affection, that they thought not of any di&s;tinct or &s;eparate intere&s;ts, they found both countries flouri&s;hing and happy. Britain &s;aw her commerce extend|ed, and her wealth increa&s;ed; her lands rai&s;ed to an im|men&s;e value; her fleets riding triumphant on the ocean; the terror of her arms &s;preading to every quarter of the globe.

<P>THESE plea&s;ing connections might have continued; the&s;e delight&s;ome pro&s;pects might have been every day extended; and even the reveries of the mo&s;t warm imagination might have been realized; but unhappily for us, unhappily for Britain, the madne&s;s of an avaricious mini&s;ter of &s;tate, has drawn a &s;able curtain over the charming &s;cene, and in its &s;tead has brought upon the &s;tage, di&s;cord, envy, hatred, and revenge, with civil war clo&s;e in their rear.</P>
<P>SOME demon, in an evil hour, &s;ugge&s;ted to a &s;hort-&s;ighted financier, the hateful project of transfering the whole pro|perty of the King's &s;ubjects in America, to his &s;ubjects in Britain. The claim of the Briti&s;h parliament to tax the colonies, can never be &s;upported but by &s;uch a TRANSFER; for the right of the hou&s;e of commons of Great-Britain, to originate any tax, or grant money, is altogether derived from their being elected by the people of Great-Britain to act for them; and the people of Great-Britain cannot confer on their <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> a right to give or grant any thing which <HI>they them&s;elves</HI> have not a right to give or grant <HI>per&s;onally.</HI> Therefore it follows, that if the members cho&s;en by the people of Great-Britain, to repre&s;ent them in par|liament, have, by virtue of their being &s;o cho&s;en, any right to give or grant American property, or to lay any tax upon the lands or per&s;ons of the coloni&s;ts, it is becau&s;e the lands and people in the colonies are bona fide, owned by, and ju&s;tly belonging to the people of Great-Britain. But (as has been before ob&s;erved) every man has a right to per&s;onal freedom, con&s;equently a right to enjoy what is ac|quired by his own labor. And as it is evident that the property in this country has been acquired by our own labor; it is the duty of the people of Great-Britain, to produce &s;ome compact in which we have explicitly given up to them a right to di&s;po&s;e of our <HI>per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>property.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="63" REF="018997_0060_0FA912C2689D9928">Until this is done, every attempt of theirs, or of tho&s;e whom they have deputed to act for them, to give or grant any part of our property, is directly repugnant to every principle of rea&s;on and natural ju&s;tice.

Neverthele&s;s, the repre&s;entatives of a nation, long famed for ju&s;tice and the exerci&s;e of every noble vir|tue, have been prevailed on to adopt the fatal &s;cheme; and although the dreadful con&s;equences of this wicked po|licy have already &s;haken the empire to its centre; yet &s;till it is per&s;i&s;ted in.

Though, but of ye&s;terday, I recollect (deeply affected at the ill-boding change) the happy hours that pa&s;t whil&s;t Britain and America rejoiced in the pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s of each other (heaven grant tho&s;e halcyon days may &s;oon return.) But now the Bri|ton too often looks on the American with an envious eye, taught to con&s;ider his ju&s;t plea for the enjoyment of his earnings, as the effect of pride and &s;tubborn oppo&s;ition to the parent country. Whil&s;t the American beholds the Bri|ton as the ruffian, ready <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to take away his property, and <HI>next,</HI> what is &s;till dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of his country.</P>
<P>WHEN the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration had di&s;gu&s;ted the colonies to the highe&s;t degree, and the people of Great Britain had, by artifice and fal&s;hood, been irritated again&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="018997_0061_0FA912C282374E78">America, an army was &s;ent over to enforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to certain acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, which rea&s;on &s;corned to countenance, and which placemen and pen&s;ioners were found unable to &s;upport.</P>
<P>MARTIAL law and the government of a well regu|lated city, are &s;o entirely different, that it has always been con&s;idered as improper to quarter troops in populous cities; frequent di&s;putes mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e between the citizen and the &s;oldier, even if no previous animo&s;ities &s;ub&s;i&s;t. And it is further certain, from a con&s;ideration of the nature of mankind, as well as from con&s;tant experience, that &s;tanding armies always endanger the liberty of the &s;ubject. But when the people on the one part, con&s;idered the army as &s;ent to en&s;lave them, and the army on the other, were taught to look on the people as in a &s;tate of rebellion, it was but ju&s;t to fear the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. Our fears, we have &s;een, were but too well grounded.</P>
<P>THE many injuries offered to the town I pa&s;s over in &s;ilence. I cannot now mark out the path which led to that unequalled &s;cene of horror, the &s;ad rememberance of which, takes the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. The &s;angui|nary theatre again opens it&s;elf to view. The baleful im|ages of terror croud around me&mdash;and di&s;contented gho&s;ts, with hollow groans, appear to &s;olemnize the anniver&s;ary of the FIFTH of MARCH.</P>

<P>WHEN the ambition of princes induces them to break over the &s;acred barriers of &s;ocial compact, and to violate tho&s;e rights, which it is their duty to defend, they will leave no methods une&s;&s;ayed to bring the people to acquie&s;ce in their unju&s;tifiable encroachments.</P>
<P>IN this cau&s;e, the pens of venal authors have, in every age, been drawn: with Machiavelian &s;ubtilty, they have laboured to per&s;uade mankind, that their public happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in being &s;ubject to uncontrouled power; that they were incapable of judging concerning the my&s;teries of go|vernment; and that it was their intere&s;t to deliver their e&s;tates, their liberties, and their lives, into the hands of an ab&s;olute monarch.</P>

MITRED hypocrites, and cringing, ba&s;e-fouled prie&s;ts, have impiou&s;ly dared to enli&s;t the oracles of GOD into the &s;ervice of de&s;poti&s;m; to a&s;&s;ert that, by the command of the &s;upreme law-giver, we are bound to &s;urrender our rights into the hands of the fir&s;t bold tyrant who dares to &s;eize them; and that when they are &s;o &s;eized, it is rebel|lion again&s;t GOD, and trea&s;on again&s;t the prince, for us to attempt to re&s;ume them.</P>
<P>DEPRAVED as is the human under&s;tanding, it hath yet &s;trength enough to di&s;cern the ridiculous fallacy of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions: the votaries of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition may, indeed, be impo&s;ed upon by them. When we place un|limited confidence in our civil or &s;piritual fathers, we can &s;wallow, with ea&s;e, the mo&s;t improbable dogmas: but there are feelings in the human heart, which compel men to recognize their own rights&mdash;to venerate the maje&s;ty of the people&mdash;and to de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;ult which is offered to their under&s;tandings, by the&s;e doating ab&s;urdities. Had princes no other methods to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es, could they not e&s;tabli&s;h their u&s;urpation, without convin|cing mens judgments of their utility? they would be more harmle&s;s to mankind than they have ever yet been. They might be &s;urrounded with the fa&s;cinating gewgaws of re|gal pomp; a few para&s;ites might bow the knee before the&s;e idols of their own creating; the weak and the wick|ed might obey their mandates; but the baneful influence which they now have upon the intere&s;ts of individuals, and of &s;ociety, would come to a period: they would not revel in the &s;poils of nations, nor trample upon the ruins of public liberty.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of this, they have u&s;ed arguments, and pur&s;ued methods, entirely different from the&s;e, to effect their de&s;igns; in&s;tead of convincing the under&s;tandings, they have addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the pa&s;&s;ions of men: the arts of bribery and corruption have been tried with a fatal

<P>AN ea&s;y ta&s;k would it be to enlarge upon the fatal con|&s;equences of keeping up &s;uch a &s;tanding army in time of peace, and of quartering a lawle&s;s body of men, who de|&s;pi&s;e the ju&s;t re&s;traints of civil authority, in free and po|pulous cities: that no ve&s;tige of freedom can remain in a &s;tate where &s;uch a force exi&s;ted: that the morals of the peo|ple will be gradually corrupted: that they will contract &s;uch an habit of tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as to become an ea&s;y prey to the brutal tyrant who rules them, hath been here|tofore largely and plainly demon&s;trated, by per&s;ons &s;o much more capable of doing it, than he who is &s;peaking, that it would be pre&s;umption in him to attempt it now.</P>

In theory, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is, on many accounts, excellent; but when we ob&s;erve it re|duced to practice, when we ob&s;erve the Briti&s;h government, as it has been, for a long cour&s;e of years, admini&s;tered, we mu&s;t be convinced that its boa&s;ted advantages are not real: the management of the public revenue, the appointment of civil and military officers, are ve&s;ted in the king: improving the&s;e advantages which the&s;e powers give him, he hath found means to corrupt the other branches of the legi&s;lature; Bri|tons plea&s;e them&s;elves with the thought of being free; their tyrant &s;uffers them to enjoy the &s;hadow, whil&s;t he him&s;elf gra&s;ps the &s;ub&s;tance of power. Impo&s;&s;ible would it have been for the kings of England to have acquired &s;uch an exorbitant power, had they not had a &s;tanding army under their command: with the officers of this army, they have bribed men to &s;acrifice the rights of their country: having artfully got their arms out of the hands of the people, with their mercenary forces they have awed them into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. When they have appeared, at any time, di&s;|po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, the&s;e troops have been ready
<PB N="77" REF="018997_0073_0FA912D30546FF78">to obey the mandates of their &s;overeign, to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brethren.</P>
<P>HAVING found the efficacy of this method to quell a &s;pirit of liberty in the people of Great-Britain, the <HI>righ|teous</HI> admini&s;tration of the <HI>righteous</HI> king George the third, determined to try the experiment upon the people of Ame|rica. To fright us into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their unju&s;tifiable claims, they &s;ent a military force to the town of Bo&s;ton. This day leads us to reflect upon the fatal effects of the mea&s;ure! by their intercour&s;e with troops, made up in general of the mo&s;t abandoned of men, the morals of our youth were corrupted: the temples and the day of our GOD were &s;candalou&s;ly prophaned: we experienced the mo&s;t provoking in&s;ults; and at length &s;aw the &s;treets of Bo&s;ton &s;trewed with the corp&s;es of five of its inhabitants, murdered in cool blood, by the Briti&s;h mercenaries.</P>
<P>THE indignant rage which &s;welled your bo&s;oms upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;the fortitude and humanity which you di&s;|covered&mdash;the angui&s;h of the friends and relatives of the dead and wounded, with all the horrors of that memo|rable night, have been painted in vivid colours by an HANCOCK and a WARREN: they have &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e exertions made by the town, which defeated, at that time, the de&s;igns of the enemies to Ame|rican liberty, and pre&s;erved us, for the pre&s;ent, from the calamities of war.</P>
<P>BUT the pa&s;t year hath pre&s;ented us with a tragedy more &s;triking, becau&s;e more exten&s;ive, than this: a tragedy, which more plainly proves the fatal effects of keeping up &s;tanding armies in time of peace, than any arguments what&s;oever: we have &s;een the ground crim&s;oned with the gore of hundreds of our fellow-citizens;&mdash;we have &s;een the fir&s;t city in America, for wealth and extent, depopulated&mdash;
<PB N="78" REF="018997_0074_0FA912D510123E18">&mdash;we have &s;een others de&s;troyed, and heard our &s;avage enemies breathing out thir&s;tings for our blood.</P>
<P>FINDING their arts in&s;ufficient to flatter, or their trea|&s;ures to bribe, the people of America out of their freedom, the Briti&s;h government determined, by force, to &s;ubjugate them to their arbitrary will; in con&s;equence of this de|termination, a large party of their troops marched from Bo&s;ton, on the morning of the ever-memorable nineteenth of April la&s;t: flu&s;hed with the hopes of certain victory, and defying the armies of the living GOD, they broke through every divine and political obligation; they wantoned in cruelty; they &s;hed again American blood.</P>
<P>AROUSED by the unprovoked injury, like a lion awak|ing from his &s;lumber, we &s;prang to arms! we felt our&s;elves in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of our ance&s;tors; we heard our bre|thren's blood crying to us for vengeance; we ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of battle: we compelled our enemies to betake them|&s;elves to di&s;graceful flight; we pur&s;ued them with avidity, and de&s;i&s;ted not till they took refuge in that city, of which, by fraud and treachery, they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>TRUSTING to the divine protection, from that hour we determined never to &s;heathe the &s;word, till we had re|paration for our injuries; till we had &s;ecured our own free|dom and the freedom of our po&s;terity: from that hour the den of enemies hath been &s;urrounded by an American army, <HI>brave and determined:</HI> although they had before boa&s;ted of their &s;uperiority to all the troops in the world, they have &s;carcely dared to &s;et their feet out of their &s;trong holds &s;ince that time; and in&s;tead of ravaging the American continent in a &s;ingle compaign, with a &s;ingle regiment, they have proceeded&mdash;<HI>one mile and an half</HI> in the conque&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THE heights of Charle&s;town witne&s;&s;ed to the world, that Americans, fighting in the cau&s;e of freedom, were a

<P>FROM one end of the continent to the other, a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es hath attended the American arms; in&s;tead of having troops of &s;avages poured down to our frontiers (which the murderous policy of the tyrant of Britain induced him to attempt) we have, through the favour of heaven, carried our victorious arms into the very bowels of Canada; in&s;tead of having our &s;tores and provi&s;ions cut off by the enemy, we have made important captures from them: &s;ucce&s;s hath crowned our enterprizes, while di&s;appointment hath fol|lowed tho&s;e who oppo&s;e us.</P>
<P>THAT elation of &s;pirit, which is excited by our victories, is damped by our feeling the calamities of war.

E&s;pecially, does it lead us to recollect the name and the virtues of General WARREN! the kind, the humane, the benevolent friend, in the private walks of life; the inflexible patriot, the undaunted commander in his public &s;phere, de&s;erves to be recollected with gra|titude

<P>WHEN we traver&s;e the Canadian wilds, and come to the plains of Abraham, where WOLFE once fell, we are there again compelled to pay a tribute to exalted me|rit, and to lament the fall of the great MONTGOMERY! warmed with a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, too little felt by his venal countrymen, he e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of American free|dom: he left dome&s;tic ea&s;e and affluence: he girded on the &s;word which he had long laid a&s;ide, and <HI>jeoparded his life in the high places of the field:</HI> victory followed his &s;tandard; &s;he hovered over his head, and crowned it with the laurel wreath: &s;he was ju&s;t ready to hail him the con|queror of <HI>Canada,</HI> when the fatal &s;i&s;ters &s;napped, in a mo|ment, the thread of life, and &s;eized, from his eager gra&s;p, the unta&s;ted conque&s;t!

THE tender feelings of the human heart are deeply af|fected with the fate of the&s;e and the other heroes who have bled and died, that their country may be free: but at the &s;ame time, &s;en&s;ations of indignant wrath, are excited in the brea&s;t of every friend to freedom: he will li&s;ten to the voice of their blood, which cries aloud to heaven, and to him for vengeance! he will feel him&s;elf animated with new vigor in the glorious cau&s;e: nothing daunted by their untimely fate, he will ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of danger, that he may &s;hare their glory, and avenge their death! every idea which can warm and animate him to glorious deeds, will ru&s;h at once upon his mind; and, when engaged in the warme&s;t battle, he will hear them, from their heaven, urging him to action; he will feel their &s;pirits transfu&s;ed into his brea&s;t; he will &s;acrifice whole hecatombs of their murderers to their illu&s;trious <HI>manes!</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, my countrymen, the people of America have every thing to animate and encourage them in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. Formidable as was once the power of the Briti&s;h lion, he hath now lo&s;t his teeth; univer&s;al di&s;&s;ipation hath taken place of that &s;implicity of manners, and hardine&s;s of integrity, for which the nation was once remarkable: the officers of the Briti&s;h army, in&s;tead of inuring them|&s;elves to di&s;cipline, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eking for glory in the blood|&s;tained field, wi&s;h alone to captivate the &s;ofter &s;ex, and triumph over their virtue.

<P>How different from this is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our

<P>POSSESSED of the&s;e advantages, we &s;hould be inex|cu&s;able to GOD, to our po&s;terity, to the whole world, if we hefitated, a &s;ingle moment, in a&s;&s;erting our rights and repelling the attacks of lawle&s;s power.

<P>WE will now confirm the &s;entiment by a brief in&s;pecti|on into &s;ome parts of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> were a republic, that, in a &s;hort flight of years, exhibited the mo&s;t glorious &s;pectacle that ever ap|peared to mankind; and, as one ob&s;erves, the age they lived in, &s;eemed to be the golden period of human nature

The bank thus broken down, the tide &s;welled too rapid to be &s;temm'd, and virtue, free|dom and the laws, all fell a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>SIMILAR was the &s;ituation of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Although not &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;tingui&s;hed as the <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> yet from the expul&s;ion of their kings, to the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> they evin|ced
<PB N="103" REF="018997_0097_0FA9118A0D5CE600">to what a prodigious greatne&s;s mankind may arrive when actuated by the principles of liberty, virtue and ho|nor. Influenced by &s;uch motives, no wonder their actions were conformable; and while the mo&s;t rigid inflexibility pre&s;ided at home, the Roman eagle flew to the remote&s;t corner of the globe.</P>
<P>CAN we then &s;uppo&s;e, when we view the characters which appeared on the &s;tage at this period&mdash;when we con|&s;ider how remote they were from tho&s;e vices which have been prevalent in powerful monarchies, and how carefully they watch'd the &s;acred alter of freedom, that they them|&s;elves mu&s;t remain a &s;tanding monument of the con&s;e|quences of this fatal mea&s;ure. Such is the ca&s;e.

<P>WE have thus far produced in&s;tances of the fatal effects of armies thus kept up, which have ended in the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the laws and government of two of the mo&s;t memorable republics in antient &s;tory.

<P>But terrible as the many executions of their mo&s;t illu&s;|trious patriots appeared to them, while the land was dreach|ed in its riche&s;t blood&mdash;however affecting the &s;ight of con|fi&s;cations,

And would to GOD, it had ever remained &s;o. O my country! with what heart-felt &s;atisfaction, &s;hould I rejoice, if op|pre&s;&s;ion had never &s;tretched her baleful wings to this once happy clime! that that liberty which an illu&s;trious &s;et of men, of whom the world was not worthy, purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate, might have de&s;cended unimpaired to late&s;t po&s;terity. But is this the ca&s;e? has this &s;courge of mankind, &s;tanding armies, never interrupted our pro&s;perity? if &s;o, why is this de&s;k hung with the &s;able covering of death! why am I &s;urrounded by &s;o many of my fellow-citizens, who li&s;ten to the tale of woe! yes, my countrymen, we our&s;elves are deeply intere&s;ted; and this &s;ame engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, which has thrown mighty republics from their foundations, has attempted and &s;till continues to &s;pread the &s;ame horrid con&s;equences in America: and in its u&s;ual mode of conduct, has been attended with every &s;pecies of cruelty, &s;ome of them unheard of before; but which your firmne&s;s, under GOD, has hitherto, and I pray ever may, &s;urmount.</P>
<P>THE &s;hocking &s;cene of that dreadful night, the fatal effects of which we are now &s;till weeping over, is beyond de&s;cription. No one, perhaps, if it is taken in every view, that was not a &s;pectator, can conceive it. When I con|&s;ider the many in&s;ults, abu&s;es and violences, this unhappy town was expo&s;ed to for months previous to this melancholy tragedy, and when the tumult of contrary pa&s;&s;ions was thus naturally excited, to &s;ee a brutal &s;oldiery, &s;cattering pro|mi&s;cuous death through a defencele&s;s, unarmed multitude, till yonder &s;treet was crim&s;oned with the blood of its ci|tizens, while a tender mother, frantic with grief, pours forth the angui&s;h of her heart over a beloved &s;on, now in|capable of any returns of gratitude; all this exhibits a &s;cene which the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed heart may painfully feel, but
<PB N="108" REF="018997_0102_0FA91194595E4340">which the tongue cannot expre&s;s. Let the brea&s;t, then, &s;till continue to beat. The&s;e, my friends, are virtuous, gene|rous feelings, and do honor to humanity. May we ever re|tain them. May this in&s;titution, &s;acred to the memory of our murdered brethren, be ever carefully pre&s;erved. Yes, ye injured &s;hades! we will &s;till weep over you, and if any thing can be more &s;oothing, WE WILL REVENGE YOU.</P>
<P>THIS glaring &s;pecimen of cruelty rou&s;ed the citizens, and in convincing colors di&s;played the effects of &s;tanding armies in time of peace. But however our exertions were then &s;ucce&s;sful, however the &s;torm &s;ub&s;ided, it was but temporary. While the &s;cales of ju&s;tice were held in pal&s;ied hands, and the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities were the highe&s;t merit, an additional force only was nece&s;&s;ary. That ar|riving, the ma&s;k was thrown off, and a &s;till greater &s;cene of carnage and de&s;truction, opened in our adjacent villages.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch proceedings, however alarming at that pe|riod, were &s;oon lo&s;t in more dreadful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ope|rations. The heights of Charle&s;town too awfully con|vinced us of the melancholy truth, and po&s;terity, while with tears of compa&s;&s;ion, they ponder the tran&s;actions of that day, mu&s;t execrate the cau&s;es which produced them. In any &s;ituation, the relics of &s;laughtered citizens are objects of pity, and the &s;ympathizing &s;pectator will ever drop a tear over them. But there may be in&s;tances, when the le&s;&s;er &s;treams of affection are abforbed in a &s;till greater &s;ea of woe. Such are the &s;entiments that mu&s;t &s;trike every brea&s;t, when we reflect, illu&s;trious WARREN! on thy death&mdash;a death, which whole hecatombs of &s;laughtered enemies, &s;trowed around thy corp&s;e, can never repay. Here, ye minions of power! ye who are dead to the calls of honor and public virtue, are willing to wade to &s;tation, through the blood of your brethren, here behold a &s;pectacle that mu&s;t harrow your inmo&s;t &s;oul. You, my countrymen, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, have attentively li&s;tened, while, like us,
<PB N="109" REF="018997_0103_0FA9119503D1B4F8">he was weeping over the unhappy fate of others. You have kindled into rage, while he has &s;et before you the dangerous nature and con&s;equences of &s;tanding armies, and prophetically pointed out to you &s;till greater events. How affecting! that he who could lament the fate of others, mu&s;t be him&s;elf deplored; and that he who could &s;o feel|ingly paint the effects of this horrid mea&s;ure, mu&s;t him&s;elf fall one of the fir&s;t &s;acrifices to it.</P>
<P>BUT it is not &s;ufficient to drop a tran&s;ient tear to the me|mory of departed heroes, or to pay an eulogy to their cha|racters. The happine&s;s of &s;uch men, who, after having expired in the arms of liberty and virtue, are now &s;haring the highe&s;t degree of felicity, cannot be increa&s;ed by our prai&s;es: no, my friends, the be&s;t way to expre&s;s our affec|tion for &s;uch great and good men, is to rou&s;e and revenge them. To hurl &s;till fiercer bolts of vengeance on an in|human &s;oldiery, who, in&s;tead of affording the la&s;t honors, &s;acred to the dead, and which a generous enemy will ever regard.&mdash;after grinning with heili&s;h plea&s;ure on the mangled corp&s;e, which alive could &s;trike terror into their bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;t heart, lodged it in a promi&s;cuous grave; that &s;ince they could not prevent his name and reputation being im|mortal, his remains might be hid forever.&mdash;O Britain! thou ha&s;t, and &s;hall &s;till weep tears of blood for this!</P>
<P>ARE not &s;uch in&s;tances, my countrymen, very convin|cing proofs of the fatal effects of &s;tanding armies, in time of peace. In &s;uch a period they originated, and from the fifth of March 1770, through every degree of violence and barbarity, to the pre&s;ent day, it is but one connected &s;cene.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;uch exhibitions of cruelty and carnage, what can we &s;uppo&s;e too brutal, too infamous for &s;uch an army? can we wonder to &s;ee our hou&s;es in flames? our altars ra&s;ed to the ground, or converted to a much more horrid u&s;e,

<P>WE &s;hudder when the faithful page of hi&s;tory opens to our view the conduct of armies, flu&s;hed with victory, &s;ack|ing towns, burning villages, and perpetrating murders, with all the other dreadful concomitants. But if we look into the conduct of the Briti&s;h army in the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> and &s;ome part of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> we &s;hall find in&s;tances of all the&s;e crimes, and, perhaps, in &s;ome places, in&s;tances beyond them. To &s;ee the third city in a neighbouring &s;tate, wantonly con&s;umed by an enemy, who not having &s;pirit or ability, to meet us in the field, de&s;cend to the&s;e little mean methods of exciting terror&mdash;to &s;ee the ravages in the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> and the garden of America thus wantonly defaced&mdash;does not the blood beat high!&mdash;do we not pre&s;s forward to exterminate &s;uch barbarians from the face of the earth! but to mention &s;till greater &s;cenes of cruelty&mdash;does not the ear tingle when it hears the &s;hrieks of helple&s;s vir|gins, dreadful victims to lu&s;t and barbarity; while the grey hairs and expre&s;&s;ive groans of an aged parent, witne&s;s to his daughter's &s;hame, plead in vain. Can any thing &s;well this complicated &s;cene of woe? it <HI>can</HI> receive addition. The&s;e mon&s;ters exceed even the mo&s;t barbarous nations. With them the a&s;hes of the dead have ever been &s;acred. But under the patronage of a Briti&s;h tyrant and his general, &s;nu&s;&s;ing the tainted gale, they have ran&s;acked the &s;ilent repo&s;itories, and the remains of one that was once amiable and captivating, flung about as food for the birds of the air

<P>No one, I think, can &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e thoughts proceed from rage or pa&s;&s;ion. They are the cool dictates of my heart. I love my country; her di&s;tre&s;&s;es affect me; nor, from this moment, do I ever wi&s;h a reconciliation with a
<PB N="112" REF="018997_0106_0FA9119745611EF8">power, who&s;e pro&s;perity mu&s;t be founded on my utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I HAVE now, my countrymen, endeavored to exhibit the fatal effects of &s;tanding armies in time of peace; not from ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, but as they exi&s;t in fact, and now prevail in our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed land. Here I would remark, that it is &s;tanding armies in <HI>time of peace,</HI> and the <HI>con&s;equences</HI> thence re&s;ulting, that we are now deprecating. Armies, in defence of our country, unju&s;tly invaded, are nece&s;&s;ary, and in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e ju&s;tifiable. We, my friends, attacked by an arbitrary tyrant, under the &s;anction of a force, the effects of which, we have attempted to illu&s;trate, have been obliged to make the la&s;t &s;olemn appeal. And I cannot but feel a plea&s;ing kind of tran&s;port, when I &s;ee America, undaunted by the many trying &s;cenes that have attended her, &s;till baffling the efforts of the mo&s;t formidable power in Europe, and exhibiting an in&s;tance, unknown in hi&s;tory. To &s;ee an army of veterans, who had fought and conquer|ed in different quarters of the globe&mdash;headed by a ge|neral tutored in the field of war, illu&s;trious by former victories, and flu&s;hed with repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es, threatning, with all the pomp of expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;pread havock, de&s;olati|on, and ruin around him; to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;oldiery and &s;uch a general, yielding to an hardy race of men, new to the field of war; while on the one hand it exalts the character of the latter, convincingly proves the folly of tho&s;e, who, under pretence of having a body of troops, bred to war, and ever ready for action, adopt this dangerous &s;y&s;tem, in &s;ubver&s;ion of every principle of lawful government. Here, if after having depictured &s;cenes of &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a nature, it may not appear too de&s;cending, I could not forbear &s;miling at the Briti&s;h general and his troops, who not willing to reflect on their pre&s;ent humiliating condition, affect the air of arrogant &s;uperiority. But Americans have learnt them, that men, fighting on the principles of free|dom and honor, de&s;pi&s;e the examples that have been &s;et
<PB N="113" REF="018997_0107_0FA9119868F3F2A0">them by an enemy; and though, in the field, they can brave every danger in defence of tho&s;e principles, to a vanqui&s;hed enemy they know how to be generous; but that this is a genero&s;ity not weak and unmeaning, but founded on ju&s;t &s;entiments, and if wantonly pre&s;umed upon, will never interfere with that national ju&s;tice, which ever ought, and lately has been properly exerted.</P>
<P>BUT while, with the warme&s;t gratitude to heaven, we view our late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and are at a lo&s;s to expre&s;s our ac|knowledgment to the illu&s;trious hero, who was the in|&s;tument, and who&s;e name, to remote&s;t ages, will be ever dear to the&s;e New-England &s;tates, let us not forget our &s;ituation. There is an army, and a very powerful one, &s;till exi&s;ting in the heart of America. Methinks the reputation of pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;hould animate every inhabitant of Ame|rica to fly to arms; and by one general exertion utterly expel this la&s;t, this only remaining power of Great-Britain on the continent. Ye, to whom the &s;acred, the important &s;y&s;tem of government is committed&mdash;ye men of &s;en&s;e and virtue&mdash;ye patriots, who feel an affection for your country and po&s;terity, let me conjure you to &s;eize the pre&s;ent op|portunity, happier than we could ever have expected, and which once omitted may never be again in our power.</P>
<P>I WOULD not pretend to in&s;inuate, that this is the <HI>only</HI> point which ought to be under <HI>immediate</HI> con&s;ideration, by a wi&s;e people or their <HI>delegates.</HI> But this I will venture to affirm, that unle&s;s this is the <HI>governing &s;entiment,</HI> in every deliberation, every other thing is &s;uperfluous. Let us then ri&s;e &s;uperior to every private local attachment. As we are embarked on one broad bottom of univer&s;al freedom, let us attend to this mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion; an occa&s;ion pro|videntially offered for future &s;ecurity and happine&s;s. If a royal army, tho' weak in its number, can thus in&s;ult us unpuni&s;hed, the mo&s;t &s;lender imagination can ea&s;ily fore&s;ee what mu&s;t be the effects of a &s;till greater force. I wi&s;h that
<PB N="114" REF="018997_0108_0FA9119DA57D3E88">the pre&s;ent generation, I wi&s;h that po&s;terity may not feel|ingly reproach our inactivity.</P>
<P>SHALL the frequent calls of our EXALTED GENERAL, who &s;eems to have been rai&s;ed up by heaven, to &s;how to what an height humanity may &s;oar; who generou&s;ly &s;a|crificing affluence and dome&s;tic ea&s;e, wi&s;hes to &s;hare with you in every danger and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hall his frequent calls be in vain? remember, my countrymen, the eyes of the good and great, in every clime, are upon the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. Liberty, di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;cenes of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, has left her ancient altars, and is now hovering to fix her la&s;t re&s;idence in America. Our exertions have hitherto been great and &s;ucce&s;sful. Let not the a&s;hes of WARREN, MONTGOMERY, and the illu&s;trious roll of heroes, who died for freedom, reproach our inactivity and want of &s;pirit, in not <HI>compleating</HI> this grand &s;uper&s;tructure; the pillars of which have been cemented with the riche&s;t blood of America. May that &s;ame ardor, which has rendered America famous, &s;till continue, and looking forward to tho&s;e happy days of liberty and peace, which our po&s;terity &s;hall enjoy, let us exalt at the thought, that future generations, while they reap the glorious fruits of our &s;truggles, will ri&s;e up and call us ble&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>"THAT man was born to delude and be deluded; to believe whatever is taught, and bear what&s;o|ever is impo&s;ed;" are political dogmas which have long afforded matter for exultation and &s;ecurity to dignified villains, from the &s;ceptered tyrant, to the meane&s;t minion of power. But however confirmed they may have been, by the pa&s;&s;ive conduct of the greate&s;t part of mankind, you, my fellow-citizens, thank GOD, you are an exception to their truth. The numerous, the re&s;pecta|ble a&s;&s;embly which now croud this hallowed temple, are an exalted exception to maxims as di&s;graceful as they are general. Ever vigilantly attentive to the &s;acred, unalien|able rights of man; equally &s;tudious in the glorious prin|ciples of liberty as intrepidly determined to pre&s;erve in|violate
<PB N="116" REF="018997_0110_0FA911A29E50B248">the ine&s;timable previleges &s;he be&s;tows; you are now convened, not merely to commemorate this anniver|ver&s;ary, but &s;olemnly to renew the re&s;olves, which free|dom, wi&s;dom, virtue, honor in&s;pire: and not barely to re&s;olve, but I tru&s;t, &s;teadily to pur&s;ue the execution of re|&s;olutions which have re&s;ulted from deliberate inve&s;tigation and full conviction.</P>
<P>To &s;o intelligent, &s;o well informed an auditory, it mu&s;t be unnece&s;&s;ary to deduce the origin of civil &s;ociety, which founded in reciprocal advantage, and &s;pringing from &s;o|cial virtue, on the combined nece&s;&s;ities and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of individuals built the general happine&s;s&mdash;a happine&s;s thus in&s;tituted, nothing but public &s;pirit, and a union of force and of council can pre&s;erve: I mu&s;t therefore reque&s;t your indulgence whil&s;t I rather point out tho&s;e evils which the concurrent experience of ages and nations prove to be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of every good propo&s;ed from civil compact. Little &s;olicitous of rhetorical applau&s;e, I &s;hall offer you my &s;enti|ments as they ari&s;e warm from a heart devoted to the inte|re&s;ts of this my parent country, in language that becomes a freeman to u&s;e when addre&s;&s;ing a free a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>SIMILAR cau&s;es will forever operate like effects in the political, moral, and phy&s;ical world: tho&s;e vices which ru|ined the illu&s;trious republics of Greece, and the mighty commonwealth of Rome, and which are now ruining Great-Britain, &s;o late the fir&s;t kingdom of Europe, mu&s;t eventu|ally overturn every State, where their deleterious influence is &s;uffered to prevail. Need I add that luxury, corruption, and &s;tanding armies are tho&s;e de&s;tructive efficients?</P>
<P>LUXURY, no &s;ooner finds admittance into a &s;tate than &s;he becomes the parent of innumerable evils, public and dome&s;tic; her contagious influence is &s;oon felt in &s;ociety, and her baneful effects di&s;covered by a general di&s;&s;ipation of manners and a declen&s;ion of private virtue, which be|gets
<PB N="117" REF="018997_0111_0FA911A34DBB6D38">effeminate habits, and by a natural gradation a ba&s;e pliability of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>LUXURY is ever the foe of independence, for at the &s;ame time that it creates artificial wants it precludes the means of &s;atisfying them. It fir&s;t makes men nece&s;&s;itous, and then dependant. It fir&s;t unfits men for patriotic ener|gies, and &s;oon teaches them to con&s;ider <HI>public virtue as a public je&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AT &s;uch a period, corruption finds an ea&s;y acce&s;s to mens' hearts. To the promotion of intere&s;ted pur&s;uits, and the gratification of voluptuous wi&s;hes, a ready &s;acri|fice is made of the general good at the &s;hrine of power. Then &s;lumbers that virtuous jealou&s;y of public men and public mea&s;ures, which was wont to &s;crutinize not only actions but motives: then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the con&s;titution. Every day new inroads are made upon pub|lic liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of re&s;i&s;tance decrea&s;es. Thus before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, &s;he mu&s;t be fitted for &s;lavery by her vices.</P>
<P>GENERALLY, but not always, for we have known a people ruled by a de&s;pot, who, from a private &s;tation, ro&s;e to uncontroled dominion, at a time when they were &s;ternly virtuous. And this mode of introducing bondage is ever to be apprehended at the clo&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle for liberty, when a triumphant army, elated with victories, and headed by a popular General, may become more for|midable than the tyrant that has been expelled. Witne&s;s the la&s;t century in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory! witne&s;s the a&s;|piring CROMWELL!</P>
<P>THIS audacious citizen, intru&s;ted by his country with

With the&s;e mercenary a&s;&s;ociates at his heels, he appeared in the &s;ynod of the State, and dared with force di&s;place the mo&s;t glorious band of patriots that ever led a tyrant from his throne to a &s;caffold. Not content with this enormous outrage upon the con&s;titution, this annihilating &s;troke upon the tottering liberties of his country, for a time, to keep up the form of a popular government and to bring parliament into contempt, he convened an hou&s;e of commons, con&s;tituted entirely of his own creatures. They met, and in a few months di&s;covered that they were utterly unequal to the po&s;ts they were rai&s;ed to, they therefore petitioned their ma&s;ter to di&s;&s;olve them. Cromwell granted their re|que&s;t, and became &s;ole tyrant of three kingdoms.

<P>Too late the patriot poniard reach'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itor's heart: Cae&s;ar fell&mdash;alas! the republic had fallen before.

<P>IF Rome could have been &s;aved, BRUTUS and his vir|tuous a&s;&s;ociates would have &s;aved her; but a &s;tanding ar|my, and a perpetual dictator, were, and ever will, prove too hard for the patriotic few.

<P>You are this day a&s;&s;embled, in order to confirm in the manner of your ance&s;tors, the band of union which ties you to me, and me to you, and both to the whole commonwealth; we mu&s;t therefore remember, with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible gratitude, the benevolence of the Almighty, who has ordered things &s;o, that this very ancient kingdom of the Swedes and Goths is &s;till exi&s;ting, after &s;o many foreign, as well as national &s;hocks, and that I, in the throne of my ance&s;tors, can yet addre&s;s free and independent States.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ured of your hearts, mo&s;t &s;incerely propo&s;ing to merit them, and to &s;ix my throne upon your love and felicity, the public engagement which you are going to enter into, would, in my opinion, be needle&s;s, if ancient cu&s;tom and the law of Sweden did not require it of you. Unhappy the king who wants the tie of oaths to &s;ecure him&s;elf on the throne, and who, not a&s;&s;ured of the hearts of his &s;ubjects, is con|&s;trained to reign only by the force of laws, when he cannot by the love of his &s;ubjects!</P>
<P>I need not put you in mind of the weightine&s;s of the engagement you are going to take; the States of Sweden know be&s;t the extent of their duty to them&s;elves and the commonwealth; may concord and harmony ever unite your hearts; may foreign views and private gain ever be &s;acrificed to public intere&s;t; may this alone be a per|petual bond of union among&s;t you; and may the ambition of any part of you, never rai&s;e any &s;uch di&s;turbances as may endanger the free|dom and independency of the whole commonwealth!</P>

MAN is formed with a con&s;titution wonderfully adapted for &s;ocial conver&s;e and connection. Scarcely u&s;hered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of him|&s;elf, to provide for them. Wrapt in a&s;toni&s;hment, with an anxiety inexpre&s;&s;ible, the &s;olitary exi&s;tant looks around for the aid of &s;ome friendly neighbour, and &s;hould he per|chance meet the de&s;ired object; &s;hould he find one, endow|ed with intellectual faculties, be&s;et with the &s;ame wants and weakne&s;&s;es, and in all re&s;pects the very image of him|&s;elf; &s;hould he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offices, and a hand &s;tretched out to be&s;tow a proportion of his labor, with a bo&s;om glowing with gratitude, his &s;oul is on the wing to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e he entertains of the generous obligation.</P>

Property and per&s;onal &s;ecurity appear to be among the fir&s;t objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous &s;uffrage to pre&s;ide guardian over the rights and privileges of their infant &s;ociety. The advantages derived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected upon the broad ba&s;is of equality, they know of no &s;uperiority but that which virtue and the love of the whole

AND yet the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have reduced to practice the wonderful theory. A numerous people have convened in a &s;tate of nature, and, like <HI>our ideas</HI> of the patriarchs, have deputed a few fathers of the land to draw up for them a glorious covenant.

<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the important occa&s;ion from which this anniver&s;ary derives its origin, and the re&s;pect|able characters that have exerted them&s;elves to perpetuate its hi&s;tory, I confe&s;s there is an unu&s;ual &s;ecurity in my feelings; &s;ince no mi&s;taken effort of mine can injure an in&s;titution, founded on &s;o memorable an event, and &s;up|ported by names &s;o ju&s;tly claiming the applau&s;e of po&s;teri|ty.</P>
<P>WHILE I rely, then, upon that hone&s;ty of intention, which is it&s;elf the be&s;t apology for its errors, permit me to employ the pre&s;ent hour, which your united voices have annually made &s;acred to the commemoration of our coun|try's wrong, in recapitulating the mo&s;t injurious of her
<PB N="162" REF="018997_0155_0FA911E94701C320">&s;ufferings, among which that on the tragical fifth of <HI>March</HI> is by no means the lea&s;t, and in recounting the ble&s;&s;ings which have followed from mea&s;ures as really di&s;graceful to tho&s;e who adopted them, as they were intentionally de|&s;tructive to tho&s;e again&s;t whom they were levelled.</P>
<P>A NATION falling from tho&s;e great principles of ju&s;tice and virtue which had made her re&s;pectable; &s;ubverting the boa&s;ted improvements of her arts to the &s;avage purpo|&s;es of revenge; with venality and corruption entrenched on her cabinet, affords a &s;pectacle too &s;erious for the amu&s;e|ment of the beholder. He turns for relief to the annals of tho&s;e people who&s;e ma&s;culine virtues have ob&s;tinately, will he not &s;ay wifely, re&s;i&s;ted the refinement of a civilized world. But from the misfortunes of &s;uch a nation, much is to be learned. As &s;he is hurried onwards by the vortex of that immea&s;urable gulph, in which empires &s;ink to ri&s;e no more, let her &s;erve us as a &s;ignal to avoid the fir&s;t impul&s;e of its re&s;i&s;tle&s;s tide.</P>
<P>TO trace Great-Britain through the whole progre&s;s of her ambition in this country, would be to &s;tep back to a very early period: for, long before &s;he avowed her &s;y&s;tem of colonial &s;lavery in the &s;tamp-act, the liberties of our an|ce&s;tors had endured the mo&s;t alarming innovations from her throne. Without cau&s;e, and without notice, &s;he had invalidated their charters; laid impo&s;itions upon their trade; attempted a mo&s;t dangerous influence over their in|ternal government, by endeavouring to make it indepen|dent of the people;&mdash;and all this with the &s;ame confidence, as though her policy and fore&s;ight, and not her per&s;ecu|tions, had &s;ettled them on this &s;ide the atlantic.</P>
<P>BUT the full di&s;play of her de&s;potic policy was re&s;erved to add accumulated di&s;grace to the inglorious reign of the third George. Then, intoxicated with <HI>America,</HI> &s;he &s;lum|bered upon the tottering pillars of her own con&s;titution;
<PB N="163" REF="018997_0156_0FA911EC5D39A4C8">the hand of &s;lavery rocked her as &s;he lay on the giddy height; fal&s;hood gilded her vi&s;ions and bound her &s;en&s;es with the enchantment of &s;ucce&s;s; while her blind ambition alone remained awake, to mi&s;direct the ordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fortune, and to make her fall equally certain and com|plete.</P>
<P>THE genius of Britain once interred, the fir&s;t &s;pectre which &s;hot from its tomb was the &s;tamp-act. This promul|gation of a &s;cheme &s;o repugnant to the fundamental princi|ples of the late Engli&s;h con&s;titution, announced the fall, but did not obliterate the memory of that much re&s;pected &s;y&s;tem, in this country. <HI>America</HI> &s;aw that the act bore not a &s;ingle feature of its reputed parent, and having de|tected its illegitimacy, effectually re&s;i&s;ted its operation. But, as though conviction mu&s;t ever be productive of ob|&s;tinacy, Britain de&s;i&s;ted not to rend in pieces the charters of her colonies, which &s;erved to remind her of the violence &s;he committed on her own.

<P>"The originals of the two republics are &s;o much alike, that the hi&s;tory of one &s;eems but a tran&s;cript from that of the other: &s;o that every Dutchman in&s;tructed in the &s;ubject, mu&s;t pronounce the Ame|rican revolution ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, or pa&s;s a cen&s;ure upon the great|e&s;t actions of his immortal ance&s;tors: actions which have been ap|proved and applauded by mankind, and ju&s;tified by the deci&s;ion of heaven.</P>
<P>"If therefore an analogy of religion, government, original man|ners, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and la&s;ting commercial intere&s;ts, can form a ground and an invitation to political connexions, the &s;ub|&s;criber flatters him&s;elf, that in all the&s;e particulars, the union is &s;o obviou&s;ly natural, that there has &s;eldom been a more di&s;tinct de&s;ig|nation of Providence to any two di&s;tant nations to unite them&s;elves together."</P>

<P>BUT let us leave the beloved remains, and contemplate for a moment, tho&s;e virtues of the man, the exerci&s;e of which have &s;o de&s;ervedly endeared him to the hone&s;t among the great, and the good among the humble.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="018997_0178_0FA91209AD7F8D70">
IN the <HI>private</HI> walks of life, he was a pattern for man|kind.&mdash;The tears of her, to whom the world is indebted for &s;o much virtue, are &s;ilent heralds of his <HI>filial piety;</HI> while his tender offspring, in li&s;ping out their father's care, proclaim his <HI>parential affection:</HI> and an ADAMS can witne&s;s with how much zeal he loved where he had formed the &s;acred connexion of a <HI>friend:</HI>&mdash;their kindred &s;ouls were &s;o clo&s;ely twined, that both felt one joy, both one affliction. In conver&s;ation he had the happy talent of addre&s;&s;ing his &s;ubject both to the under&s;tanding and the pa&s;&s;ions; from the one he forced conviction, from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other he &s;tole a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>HE was ble&s;&s;ed with a complacency of di&s;po&s;ition, and equanimity of temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his friends; and which, added to the deportment of the gentleman, commanded reverence and e&s;teem even from his enemies.</P>
<P>SUCH was the tender &s;en&s;ibility of his &s;oul, that he need but &s;ee di&s;tre&s;s to feel it, and contribute to its relief. He was deaf to the calls of intere&s;t even in the cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion: and wherever he beheld an indigent object, which claimed his healing &s;kill, he admini&s;tered it, without even the hope of any other reward than that which re&s;ulted from the reflection of having &s;o far promoted the happine&s;s of his fellow-men.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> departments of life, practi&s;ing upon the &s;trength of that doctrine, he u&s;ed &s;o earne&s;tly to inculcate him&s;elf, that nothing &s;o much conduced to enlighten man|kind, and advance the great end of &s;ociety at large, as the frequent interchange of &s;entiments, in friendly meetings; we find him con&s;tantly engaged in this eligible labor; but on none did he place &s;o high a value, as on that <HI>mo&s;t ho|norable</HI> of all detached &s;ocieties, THE FREE AND AC|CEPTED MASONS: into this fraternity he was early ini|tiated; and after having given repeated proofs of a rapid

<P>WITH what plea&s;ure did he &s;ilence the wants of poor and pennyle&s;s brethren; yea, the nece&s;&s;itous every where, though ignorant of the my&s;teries of the craft, from his benefactions, felt the happy effects of that in&s;titution which is founded on <HI>faith, hope, and charity.</HI> And the world may cea&s;e to wonder, that he &s;o readily offered up his life, on the altar of his country, when they are told, that the main pillar of <HI>ma&s;onry,</HI> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</P>
<P>THE fates, as though they would reveal, in the per&s;on of our GRAND-MASTER, tho&s;e my&s;teries, which have &s;o long lain hid from the world, have &s;uffered him, like the great ma&s;ter-builder in the temple of old, to fall by the hands of Ruffians, and be again rai&s;ed in honor and authority: we &s;earched in the field for the murdered &s;on of a widow, and we four him, <HI>by the turf and the twig,</HI> buried on the brow of a hill, though not in a decent grave.&mdash;And tho' we mu&s;t again commit his body to the tomb, yet out brea&s;ts &s;hall be the burying &s;pot of his <HI>ma&s;onic virtues,</HI> and there&mdash;

IN <HI>public</HI> life, the &s;ole object of his ambition was, to ac|quire the con&s;cience of virtuous enterprizes; <HI>amor patriae</HI> was the &s;pring of his actions, and <HI>mens con&s;cia recti</HI> was his guide.&mdash;And on this &s;ecurity he was, on every occa&s;ion, ready to &s;acrifice his health, his intere&s;t, and his ea&s;e, to the &s;acred calls of his country. When the liberties of America were attacked, he appeared an early champion in the conte&s;t; and though his knowledge and abilities would have in&s;ured riches and preferment (could he have &s;toop'd to pro&s;titution) yet he nobly with&s;tood the fa&s;cinating charm, to&s;&s;ed Fortune back her plume, and pur&s;ued the in|flexible purpo&s;e of his &s;oul, in guiltle&s;s competence.</P>
<P>HE &s;ought not the airy honors of a name, el&s;e, many of tho&s;e publications, which in the early period of our con|trover&s;y &s;erved to open the minds of the people, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent danger, his fellow-citizens flew to him for advice; like the orator of Athens, he gave it, and di&s;pelled their fears:&mdash;twice did they call him to the ro&s;trum, to commemorate the ma&s;&s;acre of their brethren; and from that in&s;tance, in per&s;ua&s;ive language, he taught them, not only the dange|rous tendency, but the actual mi&s;chief, of &s;tationing a mili|tary force, in a free city, in a time of peace.&mdash;They learnt the profitable le&s;&s;on, and pen'd it among their grievan|ces.</P>
<P>BUT his abilities were too great, his deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the limits of a &s;ingle city, and at a time when our liberties were mo&s;t critically in danger from the &s;ecret machinations and open a&s;&s;aults of our enemies, this town, to their la&s;ting honor, elected him to take a part in the councils of the &s;tate.&mdash;And with what faithfulne&s;s he di&s;charged the important delegation, the neglect of his private concerns, and his unwearied atten|dance on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etru&s;tment, will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify: and the records of that virtuous a&s;&s;embly will remain the te&s;ti|monials

<P>THE Congre&s;s of our colony could not ob&s;erve &s;o much virtue and greatne&s;s without honoring it with the highe&s;t mark of their favor; and by the free &s;uffrages of that un|corrupted body of freemen, he was &s;oon called to pre&s;ide in the &s;enate&mdash;where by his daily coun&s;els and exertions, he was con&s;tantly promoting the great cau&s;e of <HI>general liberty.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when he found the tools of oppre&s;&s;ion were ob|&s;tinately bent on violence; when he found the vengeance of the Briti&s;h court mu&s;t be glutted with blood; he deter|mined, that what he could not effect by his eloquence or his pen, he would bring to purpo&s;e by his &s;word. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the field, under the united characters of the general, the &s;oldier, and the phy&s;ician. Here he was &s;een animating his countrymen to battle, and fighting by their &s;ide, and there he was found admini&s;tering healing comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked a&s;&s;aults of the enemy, and had driven them back into their &s;trong-holds, like the virtuous chief of Rome, he returned to the &s;enate, and pre&s;ided again at the councils of the fathers.</P>
<P>WHEN the vanqui&s;hed foe had rallied their di&s;ordered army, and by the acqui&s;ition of fre&s;h &s;trength, again pre|&s;umed to fight again&s;t freemen: our patriot, ever anxious to be where he could do the mo&s;t good, again put off the &s;enator, and, in contempt of danger, flew to the field of battle, where, after a &s;tern, and <HI>almo&s;t</HI> victorious re&s;i&s;tance, ah! too &s;oon for his country! he &s;ealed his principles with his blood&mdash;then&mdash;
