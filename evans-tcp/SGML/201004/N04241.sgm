<HEAD>GOD glorified in his Works of <HI>Provi|dence</HI> and <HI>Grace:</HI> As it appears, in the hopeful Conver&s;ion, and won|derful Re&s;toration of Mrs. MERCY WHEELER, in <HI>Plainfield.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is nothing more evident and uni|ver&s;al, than the <HI>Proof</HI> of a <HI>DEITY,</HI> in all tho&s;e Works and Wonders, which con|&s;tantly appear with &s;uch Marks of un|created Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, as loudly &s;peak their Author, <HI>GOD.</HI> For <HI>the invi&s;ible Things of him, from the Creation of the World, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead:</HI> So that they who had only this Evi|dence of his Being and Perfections from exi&s;ting Na|ture, and that knew God only by the Light of Nature, and yet <HI>glorified him not, as God; were without Excu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And not only are the <HI>Works of Creation,</HI> in the va&s;t Variety of their Natures, in their untold Numbers, in their &s;hining Beauties, in their &s;urprizing Order,
<PB N="vi" REF="005228_0004_1016E92B07FBB380">Harmony, Direction, and U&s;e; &s;uch evident Proofs of a God: But the <HI>Works of Providence,</HI> are alike plain and unconte&s;table Evidences of a &s;upreme Being, that is infinitely wi&s;e, powerful and kind. In <HI>the&s;e,</HI> he hath not left him&s;elf without <HI>Witne&s;s,</HI> in that <HI>he did good. HE</HI> the true God <HI>did Good</HI> like a God, and, &s;o as no other could do. And, this, he doth continually, in a Multitude of Ways, defending and upholding of us, in Life and Motion, &amp;c. For, in him we <HI>live</HI> and <HI>move,</HI> as well as have our <HI>Being.</HI> Every Breath we draw, is by new Leave and Power from him, and if he &s;hould withhold the &s;ame, one Moment, in that Mo|ment we &s;hould die.</P>
<P>Among the innumerable In&s;tances of a divine and perpetually beneficent Providence, &s;ome are eminently <HI>marvellous,</HI> in the Per&s;ervation, Defence and Delive|rance of his poor Creatures; and demand our mo&s;t &s;pecial Notice, as there are in them the more &s;ignal Di&s;plays of the Wi&s;dom, Power, Care, and Faithful|ne&s;s of a God; and by them, is given a more plain and ample Te&s;timony for God. So that they who re|main <HI>evil and unthankful</HI> after all the&s;e, are left <HI>with|out Excu&s;e,</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>And when to all the&s;e, is added the mo&s;t &s;trong and affecting Proof of the manifold Wi&s;dom and rich Mer|cy of God, in the <HI>Redemption</HI> of Rebel-Man by <HI>JE|SUS CHRIST;</HI> the Obligations to this glorious Being are increa&s;ed beyond Expre&s;&s;ion. And how can any under the Go&s;pel, be excu&s;ed, who don't with warm Affecti|ons of Soul, improve the&s;e Evidences of the divine Be|ing and Benevolence to the Purpo&s;es of their Duty and God's Glory?</P>
<P>But as the Proofs of a Deity, which are di&s;played all abroad in Creation and Providence, breaking forth,
<PB N="vii" REF="005228_0005_1016E8BD10629C50">and &s;hining out from every Part of the Creation, as al&s;o in every Scene of Providence, are <HI>open</HI> to all &s;erious Ob&s;ervers: So, the brighter and more engaging Evi|dences of a God in the Revelation and Gift of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Saviour, cannot <HI>e&s;cape</HI> the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Ob|&s;ervation of all, who&s;e Eyes are opened to behold the Glory of God in the Face of his Son. Never, O never do the Proofs of a Deity &s;hine forth with &s;uch &s;atisfy|ing Clearne&s;s and &s;weet Influence, as they do in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> in whom, the great and glorious God may be known, &amp; believed in; known, and loved; known, and rejoiced in and enjoyed for ever. This Kind of Proof (&s;urely) cannot fail of having a mo&s;t &s;olemn, &s;weet and practical Regard from all that have felt the Power of it, in their Conver&s;ion, and ble&s;&s;ed Conformity to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And how often is it, that the <HI>Subjects</HI> whom <HI>Pro|vidence</HI> &s;ingles out, in a remarkable Manner, to di&s;|play the Perfections of God upon them; in their De|liverance from bodily Evils; and &s;o to make them Witne&s;&s;es for him: Are the <HI>very &s;ame</HI> whom <HI>Grace</HI> pitcheth upon too, for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; in their Sal|vation from Sin and Hell. And &s;o, almighty Provi|dence, and rich Grace eminently meet at the Command of Sovereignty, which &s;hines illu&s;triou&s;ly in them both.</P>
<P>Thus it was in the Days of our Saviour, when the Miracles of Power, in healing Men's <HI>Bodies,</HI> were at|tended with tho&s;e of Grace, in the healing of their <HI>Souls.</HI> And how beautiful the Sight now, when in &s;ome Imitation thereof, the Subjects of an extraordinary Deliverance by Providence, do appear to be al&s;o the Subjects of converting and &s;aving Grace? The Finger of God, in &s;ome few In|&s;tances of late, has appeared in a very wonderful Man|ner, in healing and re&s;toring Per&s;ons from long Impo|tency
<PB N="viii" REF="005228_0006_1016E8BE9930B718">and Confinement; who&s;e Difficulties had long baf|fled all Means, and &s;eem'd beyond the ordinary Methods of Cure. And O how much more of God &s;till, has there been in &s;uch In&s;tances, when they have been hopeful|ly wrought upon, by almighty &s;overeign Grace too!</P>
<P>God's Creatures are all his own ab&s;olute Property, and he may &s;ingle out which of them he plea&s;eth to be the di&s;tingui&s;h'd Subjects of his Power and Grace. And <HI>this Per&s;on,</HI> of who&s;e Deliverances I have undertaken to give &s;ome Account, has appeared for a long Series of Years to have been a remarkable <HI>Subject,</HI> and as it were a vi&s;ible <HI>Seat</HI> of the divine Wonders. God's Dealings with her have been very uncommon, and even &s;ingular all along. And by the <HI>whole Frame</HI> of his Di&s;pen&s;ations towards her, it has look'd as if God might have &s;ome <HI>Re&s;erves</HI> of uncommon Favour for her, and De&s;igns of di&s;playing his &s;overeign Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s in &s;omething extraordinary with Re&s;pect to her, as the Event now &s;heweth. Under &s;ome of the greate&s;t Weight of the Hand of Providence upon her, there often appeared a wonderful Uplifting of the Heart and Soul, by the Power of Grace at Work in her. And the Work of God <HI>in</HI> her, has ever appeared to bear &s;ome Proportion to the Dealings of God <HI>with</HI> her. And, now, what doth at la&s;t &s;o evidently appear to be done for her, &s;eems to have been aimed at, and de&s;igned in the whole <HI>Scheme</HI> of Providence, and <HI>Train</HI> of Events concerning her; &s;o much, is it of a Piece with the re&s;t. And though no one could pretend to have fore|&s;een it, yet now it has happened, it doth &s;eem to be &s;ome extraordinary <HI>Re&s;ult</HI> of divine Coun&s;el and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, the Fruit of <HI>re&s;olute</HI> Mercy, which though con|tented to appear in <HI>&s;low Progre&s;s</HI> for many Years (in Order to make the more illu&s;trious Di&s;covery of it &s;elf
<PB N="ix" REF="005228_0007_1016E8C0886961A0">in the Clo&s;e) at Length <HI>breaks forth</HI> and makes its Way through all Difficulty, appears more open, and ex|erts it&s;elf in a very di&s;cernable and &s;urpri&s;ing Delive|rance. A gracious Providence (it &s;eems) had for Years together before this, been doing enough, in a more gra|dual Way, to fix her, and others Attention to God's &s;ignal Care of her, and to keep up a &s;ecret Hope of &s;ome greater Deliverances &s;till; but now, when the &s;et Time was come, to favour her with Liberty, and to make the divine Power and Prai&s;e the more illu&s;tri|ous; behold, her Re&s;toration; mu&s;t take an <HI>unu|&s;ual Stretch,</HI> as if the Lord had not forgotten that <HI>Prerogative</HI> Character of his.&mdash; <HI>The Lord loo&s;eth the Pri&s;oners &mdash; the Lord rai&s;eth them that that are bowed down.</HI> And as if he would yet be known in that his <HI>incomparable</HI> Character, <HI>Who is like unto thee, O Lord&mdash;glorious in Holine&s;s, fear|ful in Prai&s;es,</HI> doing Wonders. Verily, he hath <HI>re|membred her,</HI> in her <HI>low E&s;tate,</HI> for, <HI>his Mercy endureth forever.</HI> And this, (as, I might ob&s;erve) has been the I&s;&s;ue of much Prayer for her, as well as in Con&s;equence of great Faith, which has appeared to be wrought in her, and exerci&s;ed by her. But, God chu|&s;eth whom he will to be the Subjects of his Mercy, he <HI>hath Mercy</HI> on whom he will have Mercy. And &s;o he fits, whom he will, in and by them, to make his Power and Grace known, and to glorify him&s;elf before the World.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of publi&s;hing this Account, is not to extol the <HI>Subject</HI> of this Deliverance, but the divine <HI>Author</HI> of it. And not to &s;peak of what appears excellent in her any further, than it may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, to give &s;ome ample <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> for God, in what he hath done for her. According to her own Words, <Q>Oh let the
<PB N="x" REF="005228_0008_1016E8C604EC48D0">Lord humble me, and let none take Notice of me, but for God's Sake, and for his Honour.</Q> And for|a&s;much, as &s;he &s;eems to view every Thing in her, that ju&s;tly looks well to others, as <HI>God's</HI> Creature and Gift, rather than as her Excellence; and al&s;o to give all that God has any Way done for her, back again unto him in Acknowledgement and Prai&s;e, I hope it will not be accounted any Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Rule, to &s;peak of her as a <HI>Monument</HI> of the Power and Mercy of God, which <HI>cannot be hid.</HI> Yea, &s;uch an <HI>open</HI> In&s;tance hereof, wherein, the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to appear in <HI>his Strength of Salvation.</HI> Yea, 'tis &s;o far from being the De&s;ign of this Narrative to magnify a poor Worm, the Subject of it, that it is rather to promote her Hu|mility; by letting her yet more into her&s;elf to &s;ee &s;till more of her own Vilene&s;s and Nothingne&s;s in the Light of the Knowledge of God, and of his Works of Won|der; which are here &s;et before her; as a Gla&s;s, where|in &s;he may (as in &s;ome entire View of God's Dealings with her) &s;ee what the Lord hath done for her; and this ranged, &s;omething in the Order of her Experience of it. And O let her Eyes be turned inward upon her &s;elf, as well as lifted upwards to God and Chri&s;t, and let her Soul be filled with &s;acred Love, Gratitude and Wonder, that even the Lord would look upon &s;uch a vile Creature, and &s;ingle her out, to be &s;uch a Monu|ment of his Almighty Power and Grace, &s;omething as it was with poor <HI>Mephibo&s;heth,</HI> who <HI>bowed him|&s;elf, and &s;aid, what is thy Servant, that thou &s;hould&s;t look upon &s;uch a dead Dog as I am.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, the De&s;ign hereof, is to fix the Remem|brance of the Doings of the Lord, upon the Hearts of the Beholders hereof, and &s;o to impre&s;s tho&s;e Truths, and that Sen&s;e of God and divine Things, which &s;ome
<PB N="xi" REF="005228_0009_1016E8C9DAFBD640">&s;eem'd to have received by &s;eeing how great Things the Lord had done for her.</P>
<P>I have (with others) been &s;undry Times to the Place, conver&s;ed frequently with her, and &s;een her the Subject of Deliverances, as I had before &s;een her, the Sub|ject of Impotency. I have al&s;o made careful Enquiry into the Matters of Fact, concerning her; and got In|formation of the Credibility of the particular Witne&s;&s;es to them. And took the utmo&s;t Care, I could that that might be a ju&s;t Account of Things, and have here re|pre&s;ented them as they are, in their own native Sim|plicity, without giving any determinate Opinion of the preci&s;e Nature of the Deliverance wrought for her, e|&s;pecially in the &s;urprizingly free U&s;e of her Feet, but leave the Reader entirely to judge thereof him&s;elf, ac|cording as it &s;hall appear to him from the whole. Only ob&s;erve, that there doth &s;eem, upon the &s;tricte&s;t Exa|mination into it, to be plentiful Matter of the divine Prai&s;e and Glory, which I hope is the governing De|&s;ign of this Hi&s;tory. And in drawing out the Mate|rials of it, and ranging of Things in their own Or|der, it will be &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary and not incongruous to intermix &s;omething of her inward, <HI>Chri&s;tian Expe|rience</HI> with the Train of <HI>God's Dealings</HI> with her: Becau&s;e the De&s;igns of Providence and Grace, do re|ally appear, to have been in Fact, carried on together. And I tru&s;t this Intermixture will reli&s;h well with the &s;erious Reader, as it doth actually reflect a <HI>Beauty</HI> upon the Work of the Lord, and a <HI>Glory to the Author.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add this further, that the Things here related, are what many do know and &s;peak of, without any Doubt of the Truth and Certainty of them. And that the mo&s;t wonderful Event of all, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Her
<PB N="xii" REF="005228_0010_1016E8CB63778378">&s;udden ri&s;ing up, and walking and leaping as one at Liberty from long Impotency, didn't happen to her when alone, nor was the Thing done in a Corner, but a Mul|titude, (who had been wor&s;hipping with her at the Hou&s;e) &s;aw it, and wondred. And &s;ince that Time, the Evi|dence of her Deliverance growing yet &s;tronger, 'tis the Opinion of many &s;erious and judicious Per&s;ons, that it is worthy of <HI>Notice,</HI> among the <HI>wonderful Works</HI> of the Lord, which he will have <HI>to be remembred.</HI> At who&s;e De&s;ire, I have here given the following Account, in brief, and in the Order as follows.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. LORD'S Account OF Mrs. MERCY WHEELER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_MErcy Wheeler</HI> (Daughter of Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Wheeler</HI> of <HI>Plainfield,</HI> and of <HI>Sarah</HI> his Wife) was born in the Year, 1706, and from a Child was favour'd with a &s;ignal Mea|&s;ure of Health, until the 20th Year of her Age, wherein, &s;he was &s;eized with the <HI>nervous Fever</HI> in the latter End of the Summer, in 1726. And thereupon, fell into &s;uch Weak|ne&s;s, as prov'd almo&s;t beyond Example. By the Summer following &s;he was brought &s;o low as to be wholly confined to her Bed, which Confinement continued for many Years. And for &s;everal of tho&s;e Years was &s;o reduced, and under &s;uch a pre|vailing Fever, that for a great while together, even every Day was expected to be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But, before I proceed to give the particular Ac|count of her Weakne&s;s; I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when fir&s;t &s;eized with her Sickne&s;s, &s;he was under &s;ome Awakenings and Concern about her Soul, which grew upon her greatly in the Time of
<PB N="14" REF="005228_0012_1016E8D294E75950">that Sickne&s;s, and in about &s;ix Weeks, her Soul-Di&s;tre&s;s ro&s;e to a Cri&s;is, when &s;he experience &s;uch a Change, and received that Comfort, which proved a continuing Thing, and of perma|nent Service to her, in all her &s;ub&s;equent low E|&s;tate of Body. She appeared very calm &amp; com|po&s;ed in her Mind, patient in Tribulation, in&s;tant in Prayer, re&s;igned to the divine Will, and &s;erious in her Di&s;cour&s;e; but otherwi&s;e made little, or no Di&s;covery of her Conver&s;ion then. And therefore I &s;hall refer the Account of this, to that Place in the Narrative, where it mo&s;t naturally comes in, as to the Date of her own more explicit Relation of it&mdash;And further, will only ob&s;erve here, that all along, even in the greate&s;t Extremity of her Pain and Weakne&s;s. She had much Faith and Hope, and Comfort in God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and often enjoyed &s;weet Communion with him by his Word and Spirit, which were abundantly with her. Yea, excepting &s;ome Sea&s;ons of Temptati|ons, Darkne&s;s and Fear, &s;he was very comfortable in the whole Cour&s;e of her Confinement. And when &s;he could not conver&s;e with her Friends, by Rea&s;on of her extreme Weakne&s;s, &s;he had, (by her Account afterwards) refre&s;hing Conver&s;e with Heaven: In&s;omuch, that &s;he would &s;ometimes &s;ay, <Q>Since the Lord was with me, in that Pri|&s;on, and made it as a Palace to me, and with his Pre&s;ence, I could freely go back there, if it was his Will that I &s;hould.</Q> And it &s;eems as if the Joy of the Lord was her Strength in her Weakne&s;s and Confinement, or el&s;e it don't &s;eem how the Frame of Nature could have kept toge|ther, &s;o long, under &s;uch extraordinary Mi&s;ery,
<PB N="15" REF="005228_0013_1016E8D41D57FE50">and Impotency, before any remarkable Revival of Nature at all.</P>
<P>And now, that God may have all the Glory of upholding her thus, in &s;uch a low E&s;tate, for &s;o long a Time, and at length reviving her; here follows the Account of &s;ome <HI>Symptoms</HI> of her un|common Weakne&s;s and low E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Her Fle&s;h con&s;um'd, 'till &s;he was reduced to a meer Skeleton; for, her Appetite was gone, and &s;he not able to eat, or bear either Bread, or Fle&s;h of any Kind, for the Space of <HI>five</HI> Years; and as to Provi&s;ion, &s;upported only, by thin liquid Food, and this &s;ome of the mo&s;t mean in Nature and Dre&s;s, that can be imagined, and put into her Mouth only by Spoonfuls; and them, but three at a Time, twice a Day, and &s;ometimes but once in a Day. Thus it was during this 5 Years, or the greate&s;t Part of that Term.</P>
<P>Her Strength had failed, to that Degree, that &s;he could not move her Head upon the Pillow, for a great while together, nor yet any Limb to help her&s;elf at all.</P>
<P>And &s;o weak in this Time, that when they turn'd her in the Bed, &s;he often, and u&s;ually fainted.</P>
<P>So weak that &s;he could not &s;pit at all, but only open her Mouth, and let her Spittle run out of it.</P>
<P>So weak in her vital Parts, that her Speech wholly failed her, &s;o that &s;he was not able to ex|pre&s;s her Thoughts by Whi&s;pers, to the Under|&s;tanding of any, but tho&s;e of the Family, who had learnt by the Motion of her Lips rather than by any di&s;tinct Articulation, to know her Mind in &s;ome Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005228_0014_1016E8D6D3B14E38">
Her Strength &s;o gone in this Time, that &s;he &s;carce opened her Eyes at all. And when &s;he did, could hardly &s;ee, &s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h Per&s;ons, whom &s;he had been mo&s;t acquainted with; and knew but a very few, of all that came to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Such was her extreme Weakne&s;s, that her Heart was not perceived to beat in all this Time, and &s;he generally lay with her Mouth open, pant|ing for Breath, as if a dying, and as it was tho't, &s;ometimes, actually a dying; and once, to Ap|pearance gone for a great while, &s;o that they clo|&s;ed her Eyes, and thought &s;he would revive no more&mdash;Such were the Symptoms of her low State, which divers knew, and have declared from their own Knowledge.</P>
<P>It may be noticed here, that in this Time of her extraordinary Weakne&s;s, a Variety of Means, with much Expence, were u&s;ed for her, but all in vain, 'till after the Experiment of the cold Bath. Near the Clo&s;e of this Time of her low State, this was once u&s;ed, and gave &s;uch a Shock to her feeble Frame, that for a Month after, her Hands were drawn up and fa&s;t clenched, and not a Joint from her Fingers Ends to her Shoulder, would bend any more, than one entire Bone. Her Feet al&s;o, were affected in &s;ome like Manner. How|ever, after this Shock, it was ob&s;erved, that Means began to operate upon her. Not only were her Joints loo&s;ned, and her Fingers e&s;pecially, which had been &s;o &s;uddenly contracted, recovered gra|dually to their proper Exten&s;ion. But, &s;he began to revive with inward Strength. Indeed her Knees and Ancles didn't recover now, nor all along, any Thing like to her Arms and Hands. And even
<PB N="17" REF="005228_0015_1016E8DAEC3185B8">the&s;e were not &s;uddenly re&s;tored to their U&s;e; for &s;till &s;he could not hold &s;o much as a Spoon in her Hand to feed her &s;elf; nor yet keep her Fin|gers out &s;traight, when &s;he held out her Arm, but with their own Weight, they would drop. But yet &s;he was for &s;ome Time recovering vital Strength before &s;he &s;pake out with an audible Voice.</P>
<P>Thus after &s;omething more than 5 Years from the beginning of her clo&s;e Confinement, &s;he began to mend. And in <HI>April</HI> 1732, on the publick Anni|ver&s;ary Fa&s;t-Day her Voice was re&s;tored to the Surprize of them about her; which, had the&s;e Re|markables attending it.&mdash;She had been for &s;ome Time now, under a Cloud, in which Time, &s;he be&s;ought the Lord, for the Manife&s;tations of Di|vine Light and Love, and prayed that if &s;he was the Lord's, he would be plea&s;ed to give her &s;ome Token for Good, and having a great De&s;ire (if it might be) &s;o to recover from her long Weakne&s;s and pre&s;ent Darkne&s;s, as to be able to &s;peak of what, &s;he was yet ready to hope, God had done for her, and e&s;pecially to &s;peak &s;omething to her youthful Companions; her Thoughts ran much upon the Liberty of Speech, with earne&s;t Prayer that this might be re&s;tored. And accordingly, it was &s;o; and that very &s;uddenly and &s;urpri&s;ingly, &s;o that &s;he &s;pake out audibly, and what &s;he was fir&s;t heard to &s;ay, was, <Q>O what God has done for me now, he has opened my Mouth, that hath been &s;hut many Years.</Q> Upon which &s;he went on talking of God and divine Things in an agreeable Manner: And giving &s;ome Account of God's Dealings with her, which &s;he was much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;peak of, and withal, expre&s;&s;ed a great De&s;ire
<PB N="18" REF="005228_0016_1016E8BA4C9AF978">of others Conver&s;ion, and being devoted to God: But it &s;eem'd to her, (as &s;he told me) <Q>That &s;he had never done any Thing for God.</Q> The U&s;e of her Speech now, continued Forty eight Hours, and then failed again for about the Space of two Years.</P>
<P>Now, it is not &s;uppos'd that her Speech fail'd at fir&s;t through any &s;pecial Defect in the Organs of Speech, but, rather through univer&s;al Weak|ne&s;s, and Failure of vital Strength. So that, &s;he was not able to deliver Breath enough, to give the Air any forcible Vibration, to make an articulate Sound. And when &s;he did &s;peak, (it &s;eems) &s;he had been &s;ome Time recovering vital Strength, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure prepared her for it; and that &s;he &s;pake &s;o &s;uddenly, and with more Strength than &s;he had &s;eem'd to have yet habitually reco|vered; might be owing to an extraordinary Vi&s;it from God at that Time. And will it be difficult unto us, to conceive, that what of gradually reco|vered Strength was wanting to enable her to &s;peak out thus, for this Sea&s;on, might be &s;upplied with the extraordinary Influence of divine Thoughts and of Light and Comfort in her Soul? which for the Time being, might po&s;&s;ibly diffu&s;e &s;uch further Vigor and Strength into her animal Frame, and rai&s;e her Courage with her Di&s;po&s;ition to ex|ert her &s;elf thus, as was &s;ufficient for this Purpo&s;e. For if <HI>the Fear of the Lord</HI> (or the vigorous Act|ing of the divine Life) <HI>is Health</HI> (or Medicine) <HI>to the Navel,</HI> and doth invigorate the Seat of ani|mal Life? It &s;eems, that, &s;ome extraordinary Sen&s;e of divine Truth and Love, may do &s;ome|thing, in a languid State, to give new Springs to
<PB N="19" REF="005228_0017_1016E8E05C0ACD70">the Organs of Speech. Certain it is, that <HI>Heavine&s;s in the Heart of Man maketh it &s;toop:</HI> But <HI>a good Word,</HI> (of which Kind many were &s;poken to her Soul) <HI>maketh it glad.</HI> And, <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart,</HI> e&s;pecially, when refre&s;hed with divine Light and Joy, <HI>the Mouth</HI> more readily and powerfully <HI>&s;peaketh.</HI> It doth &s;eem as if there was &s;omething extraordinary in her being able to &s;peak for this 48 Hours, while under that powerful Sen&s;e of divine Things; becau&s;e, &s;he fail'd again &s;o &s;oon; when yet, afterwards her animal Strength appeared, much as it was before. And now after this Re|mark; I am not about to &s;ay, whether her &s;peak|ing for this &s;hort Sea&s;on, was de&s;ign'd as a Speci|men of further Favour, in her continued Power to &s;peak; nor whether its Failure for the two Years, might be to try her Faith and Patience, and Re|&s;ignation; though the Event an&s;wered well to both.&mdash;For in the&s;e two Years, it plea&s;ed the Lord to give her remarkable Quietne&s;s of Soul, and Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will; and tho' &s;ometimes in the Dark, yet for the mo&s;t Part, &s;he appeared to know much of God, and as &s;he humbly thinks, was &s;trengthned more and more to believe and hope in God; 'till her Speech was re&s;tored to her again. But whatever was the De&s;ign of God in this extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ation, or however ac|compli&s;hed; the Thing was in Fact &s;o, &s;he did &s;peak, and then could not for this Term of Time, as &s;he and others relate it.</P>
<P>Sometime before &s;he &s;pake again, &s;he had reco|vered Strength, &s;o as to be able to &s;it up in the Bed, and to <HI>feed her &s;elf,</HI> which was now between &s;even and eight Years, &s;ince &s;he had <HI>&s;o far</HI> helped
<PB N="20" REF="005228_0018_1016E8E340913BB0">her &s;elf, and was al&s;o able to whi&s;per more intel|ligibly then &s;he had done in Years before, but, yet not able to &s;peak out.&mdash;And a little before &s;he did &s;o, &s;he was led to meditate on the Power of Chri&s;t, in his opening the Mouth of the dumb Man&mdash;And on his Power to help her in that Ca&s;e of Impotency that &s;he was in: at which Time, it &s;eem'd as if her Faith was greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and &s;he enabled to tru&s;t in the Power of Chri&s;t, and was help'd to take Courage from the Willingne&s;s of Chri&s;t, to help &s;uch a poor Creature, as &s;he was. Soon after this, &s;he was enabled to exert her &s;elf in the U&s;e of Speech, even with &s;urprizing Force and Freedom. The People by her, wondred, as they perceived her Mouth was <HI>opened,</HI> and her Lips <HI>&s;hewing forth the Prai&s;es of God:</HI> And &s;he her &s;elf, greatly affected with it. Now her Heart and Mouth, was full with the 103 P&s;alm, <Q><HI>Ble&s;s the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, ble&s;s his holy Name, &amp;c.</HI></Q> She called upon others to prai&s;e God, with and for her; and wanted that even <Q><HI>every Thing that hath Breath &s;hould prai&s;e the Lord.</HI></Q> Her Speech now continued, and is (I tru&s;t) through God's Grace abundantly u&s;ed in prai&s;ing of him. As &s;he appeared very much &s;ub|dued and re&s;igned to God, under her various <HI>Re|&s;traints</HI> by Providence, &s;o upon every <HI>Relea&s;e</HI> her Soul &s;eem'd to be the more enlarged in his Prai&s;e. And in the general Cour&s;e of her extraordinary Trials and Helps, it was remarkable, that &s;he &s;el|dom had <HI>Relief,</HI> but, &s;he was fir&s;t made <HI>willing</HI> to have every Thing as God would have it to be. And as this rendred her Confinement and low State ea&s;y to her, (becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw it was the Will of
<PB N="21" REF="005228_0019_1016E8AF775B6300">God, that &s;he &s;hould be in that State, and was therefore reconciled to it, &s;o every Relief and Mercy, both in Kind and Degree derived its <HI>Sweet|ne&s;s</HI> from its being the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of the Lord to give it to her. When &s;he was very poor, &s;he wou'd &s;ay, <Q>I am well enough, becau&s;e I am ju&s;t &s;o well as God would have me, and I dar'n't &s;ay I would have it otherwi&s;e.</Q>&mdash;And when &s;he was better, &s;he would &s;ay, <Q>I rejoice in the Ea&s;e and Help I have, only that God may be glorified in, and by me.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;he had had the Liberty of Speech &s;ome Time, &s;he more particularly related what God had hopefully done for her Soul in the Time of her Sickne&s;s; and e&s;pecially, that Experience of the Power of God upon her Heart, which, &s;he hopes is a <HI>&s;aving Conver&s;ion</HI> to God. Of which, I &s;hall in this Place, give <HI>the Account,</HI> as both formerly, and now lately &s;he has related it&mdash;And though it is what &s;he experienced about &s;ix Weeks after her Sickne&s;s began; yet fora&s;much as &s;he never gave any di&s;tinct Account of it, 'till after the Re&s;tora|tion of her Speech the &s;econd Time, I conceive this is the mo&s;t proper Place to in&s;ert it. And it is as follows,&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>In the latter End of Augu&s;t 1726, in the 20th Year of my Age, as I was taking Care of my Si&s;ter in her Sickne&s;s, and when &s;he was appre|hen&s;ive of Death's Approach; (appearing to have reali&s;ing Views and to be under the pow|erful Sen&s;e of eternal Things) &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf to me, after this Manner, <HI>Si&s;ter, you are young, and of an Age very much expo&s;ed to Temp|tation&mdash;but you &s;hould remember, that not your
<PB N="22" REF="005228_0020_1016E8E8C2B878E0">Youth will exempt you from the Stroke of Death, therefore pray con&s;ider whether you are prepared for it,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Which, was a Means, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, of putting me upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;erious Con|&s;ideration: and not thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> State to be good, yea, knowing that I was not prepared to die, and not knowing how &s;oon the Hand of the Lord might touch me, or how &s;oon Death might come, I felt &s;omething concerned about my Soul and Eternity. And in a few Days af|ter, (viz) on the <HI>fir&s;t of September</HI> following, it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it me, with the &s;ame Di&s;tem|per which my Si&s;ter had; and that, in a terri|ble Manner. And now her Words &s;eem'd to be verified in this, that my <HI>Youth</HI> was no <HI>Fence</HI> again&s;t Sickne&s;s and Death, for I was very &s;ick, and Death in a frightful View of it, &s;tared me in the Face, and I expected no other but to die in a little Time. And in&s;tead of my former vain Mirth, and youthful Follies, it &s;eem'd as if I mu&s;t be &s;oon reaping the bitter Fruits of them. It plea&s;ed God with this Sickne&s;s, to &s;end <HI>his Holy Spirit</HI> to convince me of Sin, and of my mi&s;erable State&mdash;I expected to die, but it was &s;omething beyond the Grave, which my Heart trembled and &s;hrank at the Thought and View of. The Sins of my Life, were now &s;et in or|der before my Face. And even my whole Life appeared as one continued Act of Sin, or Series of Rebellion again&s;t God: And nothing but De&s;truction appeared before me, as my Portion. I attempted to cry for Mercy, but a Sen&s;e of my Guiltine&s;s, and the terrible Apprehen&s;ions of the Wrath of God, almo&s;t overwhelmed me.
<PB N="23" REF="005228_0021_1016E8EB6FCF8850">Tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture in Prov. 1. 24-29. came to Mind, and took Hold of me.&mdash;<HI>Becau&s;e I have called, and ye have refu&s;ed, &amp;c. I al&s;o will laugh at your Calamity,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;aw, that I had &s;lighted the Offers of Grace, yea, been regardle&s;s of all the Warnings, Threatnings, Calls and Invitations of the Word; and &s;et light by all Means. And it &s;eem'd, as if my Day of Grace was over, my Concern held, and encrea&s;ed for about &s;ix Weeks, and in this Time it often ap|peared to me, that I was the mo&s;t vile and mi|&s;erable Creature in the World. And in my Di&s;|tre&s;s and Angui&s;h of Soul, it &s;eem'd &s;ometimes, as if I &s;hould have been glad to have changed Conditions with the Bea&s;ts of the Field, looking upon my Ca&s;e infinitely wor&s;e than theirs, for that I had an immortal Soul, de&s;troyed by Sin, which I expected mu&s;t bear the dreadful Wrath of God for ever, for the Sin of my Nature, and the Sins of my Life, which I &s;aw cleaved to me. Then, &s;ometimes, I &s;hould have more En|couragement, that the Day of Grace was not pa&s;t, that there might be Hope for &s;uch an one as I. And was particularly encouraged from the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found&mdash;They that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> And now, I was (with more Courage) put upon &s;eek|ing; if haply God might be found: but then, &s;uch Texts would come into my Mind, <HI>Without Holine&s;s, no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. &mdash; And the Sacrifices of the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord.</HI> So that I could not get any <HI>la&s;ting Ea&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Relief,</HI> by all my <HI>Duties</HI>&mdash;But, on the con|trary, I was made to &s;ee &s;uch Evil in my &s;elf,
<PB N="24" REF="005228_0022_1016E8ECF7D4BD68">and Sin in every Thing I did, that the more I did, the wor&s;e I &s;eem'd to be: And the more dreadful my Ca&s;e appeared, for that my Prayers, and all could not help me. It &s;eem'd, as if I was lo&s;t, and could never recover my &s;elf, but the more I try'd, the wor&s;e I grew; until my Di&s;tre&s;s was &s;o great, that Sleep wholly depart|ed from my Eyes, &s;o that I never &s;hut them to &s;leep for three Days and three Nights together. And when urged to try for Sleep, and to u&s;e for|cible Means for that End, my Concern was &s;o great that I dare not, le&s;t I &s;hould awake in Hell, and I wondred I was not there, and &s;aw that I could not charge God with Inju&s;tice, if he &s;hould immediately &s;end me there. But on the 4th Day; after I had been thus kept a|wake by the terrible Apprehen&s;ions of God's Wrath, and had lain, as one expecting the Exe|cution of the dreadful Sentence of everla&s;ting Condemnation, and had &s;een the Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, in &s;uch a Sentence; it plea&s;ed the Lord, thro' the un&s;earchable Riches of his Grace and Mercy, unexpectedly to ma|nife&s;t him&s;elf, in another Manner, in and thro' the Redeemer; by the&s;e Words of the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in Matth. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give yon Re&s;t.</HI> By which, I was made to &s;ee Chri&s;t's All&s;ufficiency, infinite Sutablene&s;s, and Willing|ne&s;s to &s;ave ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;inful mi&s;erable Wretch, as I had made my &s;elf. It now appeared <HI>real,</HI> that Chri&s;t was calling and inviting me to come unto him; and O the <HI>Divinity</HI> which I &s;aw in the Invitation, and in the Way of Salvation by
<PB N="25" REF="005228_0023_1016E8EFF7D624C8">him: And it &s;eems, as if I was <HI>con&s;trained</HI> to come (as laden, and born down as I was, with my Sins) and <HI>made</HI> to venture my Soul, and e|ternal ALL with him. I think I was made to bow to his Terms, and re&s;ign up my &s;elf to him; and (if I mi&s;take not) found an ab&s;o|lute Willingne&s;s, and De&s;ire, to take him for my Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King; and at the &s;ame Time found my weary Soul refre&s;hed and comforted, and filled with Wonder and Ad|miration at the infinite Grace and Conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that ever he &s;hould look upon one &s;o vile as I am. And when I thought what a glorious Being, and what Love and Grace, I had &s;inned again&s;t, my Heart broke under it, and this opened the Springs of Sorrow: And, Oh! Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, the almighty Phy&s;ician, who healeth the broken in Heart, that of his &s;overeign Grace, he has (as I hope) healed my Soul. To him be Glory for ever.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, I have given a brief Account, of her fir&s;t notable Experience of the Work of God, upon her Soul, which has been followed with an agree|able <HI>Chri&s;tian Experience,</HI> in the Cour&s;e of her &s;ub|&s;equent Life, and Trials and Deliverances; <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> of which, will be nece&s;&s;arily wrought into the remaining Part of the Narrative, unto which I now return.</P>
<P>In a little Time after this continued Power to &s;peak, &s;he was able to <HI>&s;it up</HI> in the Bed, and to have her Cloaths on. About which Time her <HI>Sight</HI> was re&s;tored, &s;o that &s;he could &s;ee to read a little, which &s;he had not done for near Eight
<PB N="26" REF="005228_0024_1016E8F3D15001C0">Years. As I have ob&s;erved, her Sight failed through extreme Weakne&s;s of Body, and as her Strength increa&s;ed, this was re&s;tored, and nothing more gradually than this. Fir&s;t &s;he could only di&s;tingui&s;h gro&s;&s;er Objects, and then le&s;&s;er, till &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> which &s;he then knew, as well as ever &s;he did, though at the &s;ame Time, &s;he had lo&s;t the Knowledge of almo&s;t all Things that had been &s;o long lockt up from her Sen&s;es. When fir&s;t carried abroad, ju&s;t to take the Air, and, the Works of Nature open|ed to her View; they were almo&s;t as new and &s;urpri&s;ing, as if they had but then &s;tarted into Being. Indeed, &s;he had almo&s;t lo&s;t every parti|cular Idea, and Remembrance of the whole ex|i&s;ting World without Doors, that &s;he ever had any Knowledge of; but had made a happy Pro|ficiency (even by this Time) in the Knowledge of divine Things with which &s;he was &s;o conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>When &s;he was relea&s;ed from this Eight Years clo&s;e Confinement to her Bed, and could bear the Air, a little; &s;he more evidently recovered Strength; and in about Three Years more had gained &s;o much as to be able to be held up in &s;ome erect Po&s;ture, and &s;o by Degrees to be led, or rather carried and born up, between two, &s;hoving her Feet along carefully upon the Floor, le&s;t they turn'd a&s;ide: For, even at this Time, her <HI>Ancle-Bones</HI> were exceeding loo&s;e, and &s;eparate, by Rea&s;on of the long and great Relaxation of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Tendons;</HI> that &s;he could in no wi&s;e lift them up and u&s;e them, as Per&s;ons are wont to do, that yet have not Strength to walk without Help: Yea, &s;o loo&s;e and &s;eparate were
<PB N="27" REF="005228_0025_1016E8F5586E8058">they, that a String mu&s;t &s;ometimes, be u&s;ed about her Feet and Ancles, to keep her Feet in any pro|per Po&s;ition, as &s;he lay in the Bed. And al&s;o, her Knee-Bones, were &s;o weak and loo&s;e, that after &s;he was able to turn her&s;elf in Bed, &s;he &s;ometimes put them out in doing this.</P>
<P>But yet in the main, &s;he gradually recruited, ex|cepting in &s;ome intervening Pits of the <HI>Pleuri&s;y</HI> and other <HI>Fevers,</HI> and various Di&s;tempers, which retarded her Recovery from her long Weakne&s;s; for, as it was ob&s;erved, there was &s;carce any Di&s;|temper &s;ent into the Place, but &s;he had a Share of it. Twice &s;he had the <HI>Throat-Di&s;temper.</HI> The fir&s;t Time, &s;he was &s;eized with it, &s;he was under the Effects of it from <HI>October</HI> to the <HI>July</HI> following, before any great Revival. And the la&s;t Time, which was &s;o lately, as in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1740, &s;he had it &s;o bad, that &s;he was obliged to take to her Bed again, and never could help her&s;elf more, any Thing con&s;iderable, 'till the la&s;t Day of the <HI>May,</HI> after. This now, was go|ing back again into the Depths, where &s;he was tried with new <HI>Scenes</HI> of Providence, but, &s;upported al&s;o, with new <HI>Supplies</HI> of Grace.</P>
<P>At the&s;e Sea&s;ons, &s;he had great <HI>Trials,</HI> and great <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> to ballance them. She gave me the Account thus&mdash;<Q>Once I was near choak'd, and thought I &s;hould die. And was ready to hope for it, if it might be the Will of God. My Evidences for Heaven then, O how clear were they? I had great Comfort in God. I can't tell how great. Upon &s;ome Abatement of my Di&s;temper, I was &s;orely exerci&s;ed with extreme Hunger for Bread, but mu&s;t not have it. I thought I &s;hould gladly have taken it out
<PB N="28" REF="005228_0026_1016E8F80F31B5A0">of the Mouth of the Dogs, if I might have it. A little after, I &s;aw a Piece of Bread given to a Dog, which wrought &s;trangely on my Mind, and proved a Temptation to Unea&s;ine&s;s, which brought on great Darkne&s;s. Could I belong to God, (&s;aid I to my &s;elf) when deny'd the Bread that was given to the Dogs! Oh how it &s;eem'd for a little while! Clouds and Dark|ne&s;s covered my Soul. But in this Time, tho&s;e Words in I&s;ai. 41.10. came to Mind, <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not di&s;mayed, for I am thy God; I will &s;trengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, I will uphold thee with the right Hand of my Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Which were im|proved upon my Heart, fir&s;t to bow me to the Will of God, and afterwards to comfort me. After the&s;e, were given in the&s;e Words, in Matth. 4.4. <HI>Man &s;hall not live by Bread alone, but by every Word which proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</HI> Oh how was I help'd hereby? And then was repeated the former Words in I&s;ai. <HI>Fear not,</HI> &amp;c, which came now, with great Power and Con&s;olation. And about three Days after, I was able to take Bread &s;afely, and was re&s;re&s;hed and &s;trengthened thereby. But, I was made to &s;ee that I had been &s;infully impa|tient in the De&s;ires of Death, for it appeared evident to me, that I ought to wait God's Time; and al&s;o, that I had been out of Frame, under the other Trial.&mdash;It &s;eem'd &s;ometimes, as if God cha&s;tened me to make me willing to <HI>die,</HI> and cha&s;tened me to make me willing to <HI>live;</HI> yet, in <HI>neither,</HI> mu&s;t be my own <HI>Chu&s;er:</HI> But, to live, or die as he plea&s;ed&mdash;And it came to
<PB N="29" REF="005228_0027_1016E8F9DE4AB708">that, that I was many Times afraid to chu&s;e any Thing for my&s;elf here, le&s;t I &s;hould cro&s;s the Will of God.</Q> This only for a Specimen of her Experiences under the Dealings of Pro|vidence.&mdash;</P>
<P>When this la&s;t mentioned <HI>Illne&s;s</HI> was over, and the <HI>Hy&s;terick Di&s;orders</HI> which had mixed in with all, were abated; &s;he mended by more &s;en&s;ible Degrees; &s;o that on the 25th of <HI>July</HI> 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he began to go with <HI>Crutches;</HI> bearing her Weight with them, and &s;lipping her Feet carefully along upon the Floor; for they were not yet capable of their proper U&s;e and Motion, by Rea&s;on of the forementioned Relaxation, which &s;till con|tinued. In this Manner, &s;he went at Times, for the Cour&s;e of Ten Months, in which Term &s;he often made Trial of her Strength to go without Crutches; and on the very Day of her great Deliverance, &s;he gat up, and &s;tood alone, as &s;he held her Hands on her Knees to &s;teddy her&s;elf; but cou'dn't lift up a Foot, to take a Step. And never in all this Cour&s;e of 16 Years did go one Step alone, until that wonderful Event happened, on the remarkable 25th of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t; which, &s;eem'd &s;o vi&s;ibly to crown all that Providence had done for her before.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here, di&s;tinctly tell what preceeded, attended, and followed it; in which Method, the Reader may have the clearer View of it.</P>
<P>As the neighbouring <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> had frequently, at her De&s;ire attended religious <HI>Fa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lectures</HI> at her Father's Hou&s;e; &s;o now, at her Reque&s;t a <HI>Lecture</HI> was appointed to be there on Wedne&s;|day, this 25th of <HI>May,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Lord</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="005228_0028_1016E8FF2F0D5578">of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> invited to preach it. On the Saturday Evening before, &s;he had a very painful Sen&s;e of her Infirmities, and al&s;o an extraordinary Expe|rience of the Power and Sweetne&s;s of God's Word; which both &s;upported her under her pre|&s;ent Trouble, and al&s;o encouraged her Faith in God, and Hope that it might be better with her. Thus, <HI>God &s;trengthened her, with Strength in her Soul,</HI> and &s;o, proportion'd the <HI>Strength</HI> to the <HI>Day.</HI> For, in this Time of her great Exerci&s;e, with Pain in her di&s;order'd Joints, and with Weakne&s;s in her vital Parts, the Lord appeared for her in the U&s;e of his Word, as he had been wont to do. And fir&s;t he &s;et home that Word upon her Heart, <HI>Let Patience have its perfect Work.</HI> The Sight &s;he now had of the Will of God in her Affliction, that all was as God, the wi&s;e, the good, and faithful God would have it, together with the View &s;he had of her own Unworthine&s;s of any Favour, greatly promoted her Patience and Submi&s;&s;ion. Then, came that Direction and Promi&s;e to her Mind, in Rev. 2.10.&mdash;<HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</HI> which greatly encouraged her to hold out. And then, as if &s;he mu&s;t have a more abundant Con&s;olation, tho&s;e Words in John 11.40.&mdash;<HI>If thou would&s;t believe, thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ee the Glory of God,</HI> were brought home with great Power upon her Soul, which led her to view the Help there was for her in God, in the Way of believing; and from that Time, &s;uch was the powerful Impre&s;&s;ion of that Word, that &s;he could not help thinking that God would &s;ome Way or other, glorify him&s;elf in her further and remarkable Deliverance. Thus her Mind wro't
<PB N="31" REF="005228_0029_1016E900B6F33AF0">from Day to Day, 'till &s;he had a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion, that &s;he &s;hould be healed, and that the Power of God would be &s;een in it, though &s;he knew not how. And whatever Su&s;picion &s;he had at Times, that her Faith in this Matter was not of God, and whatever Temptations &s;he had to &s;truggle with, which &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that all her Faith about being healed, was delu&s;ive, yet, it prevailed over all Di&s;couragement and Oppo&s;ition, and kept up for the mo&s;t Part, during the&s;e three or four Days 'till her Deliverance came. On the Even|ing before the Lecture, her Pains were very great, and her Ancles (as &s;he ob&s;erved) di&s;ordered and &s;eparate as u&s;ual, yet &s;he <HI>&s;taggered not through Un|belief,</HI> but was enabled, (as it &s;eem'd to her) to believe again&s;t <HI>Hope,</HI> i. e. Again&s;t all human Pro|bability; for all Hopes of healing in the ordinary Way, &s;eem'd to be cut off, and a <HI>Doctor</HI> ju&s;t be|fore, upon the View of her di&s;ordered Joints, had &s;aid, he thought &s;he would always be a <HI>Cripple:</HI> But yet, her Faith was &s;trengthened to that De|gree, that it did'nt &s;eem to her any Thing the more difficult for God to heal her, becau&s;e her State was as it was. So far from this, that her Faith &s;eem'd to ri&s;e the <HI>highe&s;t,</HI> when her own difficult State appeared the <HI>plaine&s;t.</HI> And, not|with&s;tanding every Di&s;couragement in Nature, &s;he remained per&s;waded, that God would glorify him|&s;elf in her healing, and her Tho'ts ran much upon its being done on the <HI>Lecture-Day</HI> at Hand. On <HI>the Morning</HI> of that Day, her Faith grew &s;tronger &s;till, and &s;he could not help thinking, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee the Glory of God <HI>that Day;</HI> but, this no Way &s;erv'd to &s;uper&s;ede or prevent her
<PB N="32" REF="005228_0030_1016E903632E7840">earne&s;t Prayer to God for healing. For, &s;he felt her Soul let out much in &s;eeking to the Lord Je&s;us to heal her. And her Faith was more and more &s;trengthened by meditating on the <HI>Miracles</HI> of Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially, on his healing the poor <HI>im|potent Man,</HI> that had lain &s;o long at the <HI>Pool.</HI> It &s;eems, it had been the Lord's Manner with her, to encourage, and help along, her Faith and Hope by directing her to the View of his Miracles, wrought upon one and another, wherein, &s;he had often a clear Repre&s;entation of her impo|tent Ca&s;e; and al&s;o a Soul-reviving View of the Power of Chri&s;t; &s;o &s;he had at this Time, and it didn't &s;eem difficult to her, to think that the Lord could and would help her. With this Faith, &s;he entred the Day; and was <HI>&s;trong in Faith</HI> and di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>give Glory to God:</HI> Her Mind in an extraordinary rai&s;ed Frame; and could &s;carce keep from expre&s;&s;ing it out full. When Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> came to attend the Service ap|pointed, She had a great De&s;ire to tell him what &s;he had lately met with, and what her par|ticular Faith was about her healing; but could not do it. And when &s;he &s;aw how &s;he was re|&s;trained from it, it appeared to her, that it was be&s;t &s;he &s;hould keep her Faith to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> le&s;t by her <HI>publi&s;hing</HI> it, there might be an Expectation among the People of &s;omething extraordinary, or otherways that Improvement be made of it, which might not be for the Glory of God. Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> began with <HI>Prayer:</HI> And however earne&s;t therein, for her; yet it &s;eemed to her, as if he was not &s;o earne&s;t for her healing, as he u&s;ed to be at other Times. For, &s;o intent was her
<PB N="33" REF="005228_0031_1016E90515188EF8">Mind on God's glorifying him&s;elf in her heal|ing, and he not having any &s;uch particular Faith as &s;he had, was not led to expre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o ful|ly an&s;werable to her rai&s;ed Thoughts of this par|ticular Thing. However, &s;he &s;eem'd to be in a happy Frame in Prayer, and Singing. And when Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> proceeded to the <HI>Sermon,</HI> though it was <HI>trying,</HI> and kept her Thoughts employed much in Self-Examination, yet it did not <HI>lower her Faith,</HI> but tended all to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> her. He preached from I&s;a. 57.15. <HI>I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones.</HI>&mdash;After he had given &s;ome <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the humble Heart, and had &s;poke of the gracious Pre&s;ence of God, promi&s;ed to &s;uch an one, &amp;c. he pro|ceeded to <HI>examine,</HI> whether thus humbled?&mdash;She thought &s;he could an&s;wer to his Rules of Trial, and &s;ay Amen to them, and take the Comfort thereof. After he had gone through with his Examination, he &s;aid, <Q>The Lord will revive the Hearts of the Humble, and if you are truly humble, God will revive you; depend upon it, he will, and fear not. Yea, if for his Glory, he will revive and bring you out of a Furnace.</Q> Which &s;eem'd to &s;ink into her Heart, as if the Lord did indeed &s;et it home by his Spirit: Then by the Power of the Word upon her Soul, &s;he fell a <HI>Trembling;</HI> but this without any <HI>Diffidence</HI> and <HI>Terror;</HI> for it was given to her at that Time, to believe that the Lord would revive and help her, and bring her out. This involuntary Shaking now, continued but a few
<PB N="34" REF="005228_0032_1016E90A07681E40">Minutes; and Nothing in her Behaviour was there, to interrupt the religious Exerci&s;e of the People. Her Mind and Heart kept up, in a rai&s;ed Frame; but yet &s;he was compo&s;ed thro' the whole, and was more and more confirm'd in it, That the Lord would &s;hew his Glory in help|ing her. After Service was over, Mr. <HI>Newel</HI> asked her how &s;he was; but &s;he was too much overcome, to tell how. And when &s;he began to &s;peak, it was &s;omething abruptly&mdash;(&s;omewhat like as the Spou&s;e, when overcome with Di&s;cove|ries, begins thus&mdash;<HI>The Voice of my Beloved:</HI>) Plain|ly &s;hewing that her Mind was full of Thought, and that her Ideas crowded &s;o fa&s;t to the Door of Out-lett, that they could not ob&s;erve the ju&s;te&s;t Order in their Expre&s;&s;ion, and Manner of coming forth.</P>
<P>She was now &s;et upon the Bed, &s;omething &s;pent and overcome. Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> came, and &s;at down by her, and di&s;cour&s;ed with her a little, but &s;oon perceived her to be too much overcome for any Conver&s;ation almo&s;t: &s;he expre&s;t a great De&s;ire of &s;ubmitting to the Will of God; but cou'dn't help talking about her Healing, and &s;aid, &s;he &s;aw that Chri&s;t was <HI>willing</HI> to heal her. Upon which, Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> replied, that &s;he &s;hould have the Will of Chri&s;t concerning her. But by this Time &s;he was &s;o overpowered with the Sen&s;e of God (as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it) <Q>That &s;he could hardly &s;peak, and could not tell what to compare her&s;elf to, but, <HI>An Atom drown|ed in the Sea:</HI></Q> So &s;wallowed up was &s;he, with the Thoughts and Sen&s;e of God, and e|very Way &s;urrounded with his Power. And
<PB N="35" REF="005228_0033_1016E90B8F0E89B8">then only ob&s;erved to Mr. <HI>Lord,</HI> that it &s;eem'd to her, as if GOD was with her of a Truth&mdash; and &s;o &s;topped&mdash;Upon which he replied, <Q>If &s;o, then you are well of it, and I will leave you for the pre&s;ent,</Q> which he thought be&s;t; becau&s;e &s;he was much &s;pent, and he was afraid &s;he would be quite overcome with any more Conver&s;ation then. So, he gat up &amp; walked away among the People, that were yet tarrying in the Hou&s;e. And no &s;ooner was he gone from her, but it turn'd in her Mind &mdash; <Q>The <HI>Lecture</HI> is ended, and the Service <HI>all over,</HI> and I am not healed; what is become of my Faith now? Won't it be with me, as it u&s;ed to be?</Q> Whereupon a Cloud of great Darkne&s;s came o|ver her, for a Minute or two; in which Time, &s;he was led again into her &s;elf, to &s;ee what a poor unworthy Creature &s;he was, and had &s;ome &s;uch Thoughts of the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God's Will, that &s;he felt a Di&s;po&s;ition to be as God would have her be. Then tho&s;e Words were repeated to her, &mdash; <HI>If thou wilt believe, thou &s;halt &s;ee the Glory of God.</HI> By which her Darkne&s;s was carried clear off, and under the Influence of this Word, NOW, &s;he &s;eem'd (as &s;he expre&s;t it) <Q>to be <HI>wholly taken out of her &s;elf, into the Hands of God;</HI> and enabled to believe that he could and would heal her.</Q> Immediately upon which, &s;he felt a &s;trange irre|&s;i&s;tible Motion and Shaking, which began fir&s;t with her Hands; and quickly &s;preading over her whole Frame; in which Time, &s;he felt a kind of Weight upon her; a &s;ort of racking of her Frame; every Joint as it were, working; and as
<PB N="36" REF="005228_0034_1016E90E5EE37880">if &s;he was with Hands &s;queezed together, in her weak Places. As this Trembling went off, her Pains went with it, and &s;he felt <HI>&s;trong,</HI> e&s;|pecially in the <HI>Seat</HI> of Life, where &s;he had been mo&s;t remarkably <HI>weak;</HI> and from thence Strength diffu&s;ed it &s;elf all over her animal Frame, into her Hips, Knees, Ancles &amp;c. She felt &s;trong and well, as if &s;he had no Di&s;ea&s;e upon her, and was under no Difficulty. And as &s;he had this Sen|&s;ation of new Strength and Freedom, &s;he felt as if &s;he was a rai&s;ing up, and mu&s;t ri&s;e; and im|mediately <HI>ro&s;e up</HI> and <HI>walked</HI> away among the People, with evident Sprightline&s;s and Vigour, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of her &s;elf and tho&s;e about her. She went this Time near 16 Feet, crying out, <Q>Ble&s;s the Lord Je&s;us, who has healed me!</Q> but was &s;oon damp'd with this Tho't, that &s;he was only in a <HI>Frenzy,</HI> and <HI>not healed;</HI> and the more &s;o, when Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> (&s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing her to walk thus, whom he had ju&s;t be|fore left impotent and overcome too, &s;o that &s;he could hardly talk) did ob&s;erve to her, that &s;he was in a Frenzy, and accordingly took hold of her and led her to the Bed, and bid her &s;it down; yea, even thru&s;t her down. But &s;he could not be confined there; feeling yet &s;trong and at Liberty, &s;he quickly ro&s;e up again, with tho&s;e Words in her <HI>Mind, I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting Love,</HI> and with the high Prai&s;es of God in her <HI>Mouth.</HI> Her Soul being filled with &s;uch Admiration and Love, as &s;he declared was inexpre&s;&s;ible. Now &s;he walked &s;everal Times acro&s;s the Room with Strength and Steddine&s;s; which even con&s;trained the People to think and
<PB N="37" REF="005228_0035_1016E90FF0745F88">&s;ay, Verily, This is the Power of God! and they wondred and prai&s;ed the &s;ame. And it was about 6 of the Clock in the Afternoon that the Thing was done, at which they all marvelled, and ha|ving united in a Prayer, and in Prai&s;e, on this remarkable Occa&s;ion, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to their &s;everal Homes, &s;till wondring and rejoicing at what their Eyes had beheld, and their Ears had heard that Day.</P>

Now to return to the Narrative, and to &s;peak particularly of the Con&s;equences of this Event, from the Clo&s;e of that Day, on which it happen|ed, and &s;o forward to this Day&mdash;I have given Account of her walking alone, and with evident Tokens of new Strength, in the Pre&s;ence of many Witne&s;&s;es, on that Day of her Deliverance. So &s;he continued able to walk all the Evening after, went to her Bed, &s;tood up and undre&s;t her &s;elf, which &s;he had not done before in 16 Years. She lay down to re&s;t, believing in God, and giving thanks for the Wonders he had done, but, thro' the abundance of Thought, &s;lept but little that Night. Sometime in the Night felt &s;uch Return of her pains, as gave her to think, God was about to try her; And moreover it was Sugge&s;ted to her, <Q>Tho' you have had Strength to walk, yet it will be &s;oon taken away, and how will you bear that?</Q> But this Temptation was pre&s;ently over, as &s;he felt her Will bowed to the Will of God, and it &s;eemed to her, as if &s;he was made willing to go back again to Pri&s;on, if it was the Plea&s;ure of the Lord, that &s;he &s;hould; and the whole Term of her being there, now &s;eemed &s;hort to her from the &s;weet Review &s;he had of God's pre&s;ence with her there. In the Morning her Pains continued, but her Faith tho' tried, &s;ailed not. As &s;oon as the Light favoured her, &s;he reach'd for her Bible, and began to read, and found new Strength by the Word. Tho' it had been darted into her Mind, "You won't be able to ri&s;e and walk." She found pre&s;ent Relief by that Word.&mdash;<HI>All Things are po&s;&s;i|ble to him that believeth.</HI> And reading the Ac|count of three Miracles which Chri&s;t wrought, &s;he
<PB N="40" REF="005228_0038_1016E91940E946C0">was &s;till more encouraged and &s;trengthened in her Faith&mdash;Her Pains abated, and it &s;eem'd, as if &s;he was bid to ari&s;e. She ro&s;e up, and dre&s;t her&s;elf, without Help, which &s;he had not done before in all the Time of her Weakne&s;s. When dre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf, it came into her Mind to view and feel of her Ancles, which &s;he found to her Admiration and Thankfulne&s;s, were clo&s;ed and firm, where before they were &s;eparate and loo&s;e. As on the other Day, when &s;he was, as it were, taken by the Hand and lifted up, &s;he perceived that immediately her Feet and Ancle-Bones re|ceived Strength: So now, &s;he &s;aw, that they were clo&s;ed up; as they never had been be|fore in all her Impotency. And &s;o, &s;he had an Evidence of her Healing, from <HI>Sight,</HI> as well as <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI> She dre&s;t, and walked, prai&s;ing God. After having walked about the Hou&s;e a while, &s;he went abroad, and over to her Brother's Hou&s;e, about twelve Rods. This was all new Exerci&s;e, to her; and opened to her new Ob|&s;ervations; and let in new Reflections. And the Di&s;covery and Sen&s;e of God in her late De|liverance, &s;eem'd to reflect a new Light upon e|very Thing &s;he &s;aw and met with. She could turn her-Eyes no Way, but the World about her, &s;eem'd full of the Evidence of a God and Providence, which all &s;erv'd to keep her Soul at Work, and in its Exerci&s;e of Love and Duty to God.</P>
<P>On this Day (viz.) the Day after her Deliver|ance, Mr. <HI>Newel</HI> (who was then preaching at <HI>Plainfield</HI>) preached a Sermon at her Father's Hou&s;e, from tho&s;e Words, in Joh. 5.14. <HI>Afterwards Je&s;us
<PB N="41" REF="005228_0039_1016E91BF74769B8">findeth him in the Temple, and &s;aid unto him, Behold, Thou art made whole: Sin no more, le&s;t a wor&s;t Thing come unto thee.</HI> Which proved a &s;ea&s;onable Word unto her, as thereby &s;he was taught the Danger, which tho&s;e are yet in of &s;inning, who have been the Subjects of great Deliverances, and &s;o was led to &s;ee her Danger of Pride, Sloth, Unthankfulne&s;s &amp;c. And as &s;he had di&s;covered a great De&s;ire to be, and even a Per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;he &s;hould be in the Hou&s;e of God the next Sab|bath; &s;o in hearing this Sermon &s;he was much confirmed therein. And accordingly on the very Sabbath following (though cloudy and rainy, and before &s;he had been u&s;ed to the Air much) &s;he was enabled to ride to the Hou&s;e of the Lord, which was near three Miles; and had not been upon an Hor&s;e, in &s;ixteen Years before. As &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing thereto, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to her, <Q>You are got from your Father's Hou&s;e, and going where you know not, and it may be will never return.</Q> Upon which, &s;he had a Thought of being carried back directly; but the Temptation was repelled with that Word, <HI>They that tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be moved.</HI> And (as &s;he expre&s;t it) it &s;eem'd to her, as though the Lord, by a &s;trong Hand, brought her to his Sanctuary, where &s;he was enabled to attend on the publick Wor&s;hip all the Day, without Pain, or Wearine&s;s, or ta|king any Cold.&mdash;On the fir&s;t Day of June, Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> preached a publick Lecture there from Acts 3.6&mdash;10.&mdash; <HI>And immediately his Feet and Ancle-Bones received Strength, and he leaping up, &s;tood and walked, and entred with them into the Tem|ple,
<PB N="42" REF="005228_0040_1016E91FC0F87960">walking and leaping and prai&s;ing God, and all the People &s;aw him walking and prai&s;ing God.</HI> Which were &s;o true of her, that, on that Day &s;he entred with them into the Temple walking, &amp;c. and all the People &s;aw it. &mdash; On the 14th of <HI>June,</HI> another Sermon was had there, from <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.28. And &s;he attended then, and walked from the Meeting-Hou&s;e, to a private one, many Rods. She has been a|ble to walk ever &s;ince, and generally has at|tended the publick Wor&s;hip on Sabbath-Days from the fir&s;t, and begins to travel abroad in|to other Towns. The la&s;t Week &s;he rode to <HI>Norwich,</HI> which is 15 Miles; and was at the publick Wor&s;hip and Communion with us the la&s;t Sabbath; and walked both to, and from the Hou&s;e of God, Morning and Evening. &mdash; Thus evident is her Re&s;toration, and increa&s;ing Strength and Health al&s;o. For, never did &s;he, in all her former Revivals, recover Health, nor ever could &s;he take Food and Sleep for that Purpo&s;e; as now, &s;ince this la&s;t Deliverance. And for this Rea&s;on has the <HI>Narrative</HI> been the more readily delayed unto this Time; that <HI>Days</HI> might give the <HI>&s;tronger Proof</HI> of what was &s;o &s;udden and &s;urprizing. Thus it con&s;tantly appears, to have been no <HI>Frenzy</HI> of her's, that &s;he fir&s;t walked; but a <HI>Fact,</HI> and Work of the Lord; for &s;he has done &s;o, many Months, and is as like to do &s;o &s;till, as any other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And a further Te&s;timony for God, is yet exhibited, in her moral Conduct. She walketh <HI>prai&s;ing GOD</HI> wherever &s;he goes. It &s;eems, as if her Soul was in Health, and pro&s;pered. She
<PB N="43" REF="005228_0041_1016E9214A38C688">appears to have an abiding Sen&s;e of God up|on her Soul, and to walk up and down in the Light of God's Countenance; rejoicing in God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as her All. But, with great Self-Diffidence and cautionary Fear, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;ome Way or other di&s;honour God, and be a Stum|bling Block to Men. And &s;o I &s;hall clo&s;e up the Narrative, with giving the Reader a <HI>Specimen</HI> of her daily Reflections, and Breathings of Soul, in her own Language&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Scarce one Day now, do I look abroad, but the <HI>Works of Creation</HI> &s;hew me God, and lead me to him: And yet dare not &s;ay that I live one Minute as I ought&mdash;I want to &s;ee more of the <HI>Dealings of God</HI> with me, that I might live more to him&mdash; Oh how &s;hould I live! entirely devoted to God, as my con|&s;tant End and All&mdash;If I could prai&s;e God, it &s;eems that I &s;hould be content in any Condition, that he would have me in&mdash; Oh what a Life &s;hould I live? Never a Soul &s;o indebted to God as I am. It was the lowe&s;t Stoop that ever <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> made, when he look'd <HI>upon me</HI>&mdash; When I think how he has pa&s;&s;ed by Thou|&s;ands, and has had Mercy on me, the Vile&s;t of all; how &s;urprizing? 'Tis only becau&s;e he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy&mdash; And yet how unthankful am I! My Heart is &s;urely wor&s;e than others. O my Ingratitude! How good is God, and how holy! &mdash;It &s;eems that I never did any Thing &mdash;And without Chri&s;t I can do nothing&mdash;I long that Chri&s;t may be all; and what is all el&s;e compared with him! Oh that I may
<PB N="44" REF="005228_0042_1016E92459485DC8">live wholly on him, and to God by him!&mdash; But I am afraid to &s;peak, le&s;t it would be to &s;hew my &s;elf: and yet I know that if others have any Thing to boa&s;t of, I've nothing, whereof to glory. O that God would hum|ble me, and glorify him&s;elf!</Q>&mdash;Such Kind of Reflections and Breathings go into her daily Conver&s;ation. And was it the Ob&s;ervation that Chri&s;t made of his Di&s;ciples? <HI>I am glorified in them.</HI> May this be eminently true of her; and let all that has been here &s;aid, be &s;o received, that Chri&s;t may be glorified in and by her. Yea, when, <HI>CHRIST comes to be glorified in his Saints,</HI> may He be <HI>admired in her, as in all them that believe.</HI></P>
