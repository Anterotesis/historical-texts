<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTH. xviii. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Verily I &s;ay unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE main Subject which our Lord JESUS CHRIST in&s;i&s;ted on in the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try&punc; was, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion and the New Birth. When <HI>Nicodemus</HI> came to conver&s;e with him, he took the Fir&s;t Opportuni|ty to &s;urprize the Honourable <HI>Rabbi</HI> with this mo&s;t important Doctrine: <HI>Except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the King|dom of</HI> GOD, Joh. iii. 3. And here in my Text, when the ambitious Di&s;ciples came to him to determine a Di&s;pute which they had been no doubt warmly engaged in; <HI>Which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> Nay, &s;ays our Lord, Not too fa&s;t! <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children,</HI> ye &s;hall not &s;o much as <HI>enter in</HI> there at all. Pride, and Strife, and Emulations, are no Preparatives for that World. Nor the Kingdom of Grace below, nor the Kingdom of Glory above, is to be enter'd with this unmorti|fied,
<PB N="6" REF="041920_0003_101B6C9AF40F83C0">
a&s;piring Temper. Conver&s;ion, Humility, and a new Life, mu&s;t make us meet for that Inheritance in Light. CHRIST him&s;elf has determined this Matter, and it therefore comes to us with all Authority and Conviction. Let us then attend earne&s;tly to the Illu&s;tration and Application of the Words.</P>
<P><HI>Except ye be converted,</HI> &s;ays the Text. Conver&s;ion, and to be converted, are Phra&s;es often found in the Holy Scriptures; and our Salvation turns upon our right under&s;tanding what they mean. The Literal Sen&s;e of the word <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> then is no more than this, <HI>turning about.</HI> And this is the meaning of the Word in this Place: and &s;o it is explained in many other Texts. Sinners are called upon to <HI>turn:</HI> and this Short Word comprizes in it all Salvation. Let us meditate a little here, and endeavour to under&s;tand it well.</P>
<P>Man was at fir&s;t created holy and happy in the Enjoyment of GOD. The Soul of <HI>Adam</HI> was filled with Thoughts of GOD, and love to him. The Glory of GOD was his End in all that he did. A Sen&s;e of GOD, Love to GOD, and Satisfaction in the Will of GOD, made up the Happine&s;s of <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradi&s;e. The Soul was &s;atisfied and crowded with the Enjoyment of the Infinite Being; and a Sen&s;e of his Glories, and his Love.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner did <HI>Adam</HI> &s;in, and renounce this Happine&s;s, than GOD for&s;ook him, and he was left de&s;titute and empty. That Soul which was once filled full of GOD, has now in it a va&s;t Cha&s;m. We feel indeed our want of Happine&s;s: But our dark Minds know not where to find it. The De&s;ire remains: but the Satisfaction is lo&s;t and gone. Our Souls feel &s;ome|thing wanting. There's a va&s;t Hollow there without any thing to fill it up. It is con&s;tantly craving, <HI>Give, Give.</HI> That's the Rea&s;on that Men are never perfectly ea&s;y and at Re&s;t. They are forever pur&s;uing that Happine&s;s which they con&s;tantly mi&s;s of. GOD is gone, and Happine&s;s with Him: and they try to fill up the empty Space, with every thing they can lay their Hands on. Riches, and Honours, and Sen&s;ual Plea&s;ures, the&s;e they fancy will make them happy. They try; and try again; and repeat their tryal: But they &s;till meet a Di&s;appointment. They think; If ever I obtain &s;uch a thing I &s;hall be &s;atisfied: If ever I get into &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, I &s;hall &s;et down contented. They obtain what
<PB N="7" REF="041920_0004_101B6C9EA3620F48">
they de&s;ire, and are ju&s;t where they were before. Then they put off the Point of Happine&s;s a little further, and &s;till think on &s;ome Temporal Good which they have not yet enjoyed. If they obtain this too, they are &s;till di&s;appointed. Thus they go on from one Deceit to another, till Death overtakes them, before they have tryed their la&s;t Project. This has been the Ca&s;e of all Mankind, a very few excepted, from <HI>Adam</HI> until now: Nor will Men take Warning after all. All pa&s;t Exam|ples, and all their own Experience to this Moment, will make no la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion on them. They have lo&s;t their Hap|pine&s;s in GOD? they wander from Creature to Creature in Pur&s;uit of it. Madne&s;s is in their Hearts while they live; and after that they go down unto the Dead. I am not at all wandering from my Text, in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, but making clear the Way to it.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ion then lies here. The Man as he is pur&s;uing Happine&s;s in Creatures, is &s;top'd &s;hort, and convinced that the&s;e will not do&punc; GOD gives him a New Sight of things. He <HI>&s;ees an End of all Perfection</HI> below GOD. He &s;ees he is undone every where el&s;e. Now his Will is renewed. He <HI>turns about:</HI> (THAT'S CONVERSION) he TURNS ABOUT to God, and from this Time &s;eeks all Happine&s;s in Him alone. He &s;ays, <HI>Who &s;hall &s;hew me any Good?</HI> and he replies, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me. Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides Thee.</HI> For ever after this Turn of Soul, the Man is &s;et upon plea&s;ing GOD: upon yielding to the Will of GOD: upon approving him&s;elf in the Sight of GOD. He never &s;eeks his Happine&s;s in the Creature any more. He may indeed, under the Power of Temptation, ca&s;t a wi&s;hing Look at them: But he recalls it in a Moment. He never can re&s;t ea&s;y one Moment &s;hort of the Favour of GOD. Like the Needle touch'd by the Magnet, &s;till pointing Northward. When it is &s;haken indeed and to&s;t about, it trembles, it wavers, it vibrates, it varies a Point this way and that, but it never fix|es but right North again. So a Soul thus touched by the SPIRIT of GOD, may be to&s;t by Temptations, and the Hurries of the World, and look this Way and that among the Creatures, till the Violence of the Shock is over, but it never fixes; never re&s;ts, till it points full and &s;teady to GOD again. This &s;hort Paragraph is, I think, a full and clear Account.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="041920_0005_101B6CA249709488">We all are &s;eeking Happine&s;s. Every Natural Man &s;eeks for it &s;omewhere below GOD. Conver&s;ion is, The Man &s;eeing he is infinitely wrong, <HI>turns about</HI> to GOD again to &s;eek his whole Satisfaction there. I hope I have now &s;aid enough in a few Words to explain the Matter, and &s;hew what Conver&s;ion is. Before we proceed, we may make one or two &s;olemn and affecting Reflections.</P>
<P>From what we have heard, we perceive that <HI>Conver&s;ion is out of our own Power.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to convert our|&s;elves; or for all the Angels in Heaven to do it for us. To convince you of this, Let the Natural Man make the Experi|ment. Try this Moment. Try and &s;ee whither you can bring your Hearts to this, to renounce all Happine&s;s in every thing but the Favour of GOD; to let GOD order for you; to have no Will of your own; to be &s;wallowed up, and ra|vi&s;h'd with his Will, whatever it is. Can you renounce every mortal Idol? Can you leave this World, and all the low Delights of it, to go to a World where you will have none of them, but the Love of GOD will &s;wallow you up? The&s;e things are &s;o di&s;tant from an unrenewed Heart, that they look like wild Paradoxes to it. The Man finds he can't bring his Heart to this; and he thinks no Body ever could. And yet, there is not a Good Man upon Earth, but knows a little what this means. He knows a little what it is to love GOD; to have his Happine&s;s in GOD; to exult that the Will of GOD is done. Not a Good Man upon Earth, but would gladly leave all the Delights of Life, only to be made perfectly holy. Nay, all he fears in Death is, le&s;t it &s;hould not convey him to World of perfect Holine&s;s. Could he be &s;ure that con&s;ummate Holine&s;s would be to him the immediate Con&s;equent of Death, he'd die chearfully, without a Struggle or a Groan. Seeing then that Conver&s;ion is not in our own Power, let us repair to GOD for it. Sen&s;ible, and amazed at our own Incapacity, let us take to our &s;elves Words and pray with repenting <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. xxxi. 18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned; for thou art the Lord my</HI> GOD. Be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;inful Nature which &s;till carries us away from him. Be &s;en|&s;ible of that fir&s;t Sin, by which we departed from him, and pray, P&s;al. lxxx. 19. <HI>Turn us again, O Lord</HI> GOD <HI>of Ho&s;ts, and cau&s;e thy Face to &s;hine and we &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> To &s;ee our Impotency is the fir&s;t Step towards Conver&s;ion</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="041920_0006_101B6CA3E24C0B68">We here &s;ee <HI>our Nece&s;&s;ity of</HI> JESUS CHRIST We can't turn again to GOD without Him. No man can come to the Father but by Him. The Enmity be|tween GOD and us is irreconcilable but by CHRIST. Out of him GOD is a con&s;uming Fire. We may in|deed feel the Want of Happine&s;s, but we &s;hould never dare to go to GOD for it. He would be our Enemy, and we &s;hould hate him for it. <HI>Fal&s;e Notions</HI> of the Divine Ju&s;tice and Mercy could never bring us truly to him: And <HI>true ones</HI> would only drive us farther from him. So that &s;et CHRIST a&s;ide, and there can be no Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>We learn al&s;o <HI>the Honours of the</HI> HOLY GHOST. He is the Agent who performs this Work. One Rea&s;on that Men fall Short of this &s;aving Change, is the not acknowledging him as they ought. Did men regard the Operation of the Holy SPIRIT more, there would be more frequent Converts. Men are apt to tru&s;t to their own Strength when they &s;et about the Work of Conver&s;ion. They rob the Spirit of GOD of his Glory, and &s;o it all comes to nothing. He it is who makes this great Change in men. He mu&s;t be the Almighty GOD then: and we &s;hould honour him as &s;o.</P>
<P>You &s;ee <HI>how many mi&s;take in their Notions of Conver|&s;ion.</HI> Some think that to be converted is only to profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Religion. They fancy that to turn from Heatheni&s;m to Chri&s;tianity is all that is implied in it. To talk of a Bap|ti&s;ed Per&s;on's being afterward converted they think is Cant and Super&s;tition. This is the modern (I wi&s;h I could not add, the obtaining and fa&s;hionable) Scheme. If we &s;peak of our being <HI>Converted,</HI> they a&s;k, why what were you before? <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Heathen?</HI> Alas, the fatal Mi&s;take! We are all undone in our Natural State, unle&s;s we know what Con|ver&s;ion means. We are all naturally departing from GOD, and &s;eeking Happine&s;s in &s;omething below him. If ever we are happy then, it mu&s;t be by our &s;topping here, and turning about to him. Conver&s;ion does not con&s;i&s;t, in embracing a new Sect, or Party: in Bapti&s;m, or Approach to the Lord's Table; or any external Privilege, or Advantage, or Altera|tion. No; it con&s;i&s;ts in turning from the Creature to GOD.</P>
<P>We &s;ee al&s;o the Propriety of the Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, Except ye <HI>become as Little Children.</HI> Con|ver&s;ion implies &s;uch a Change as will bring us to be|gin
<PB N="10" REF="041920_0007_101B6CA58C175A28">
our Life anew. We mu&s;t become as Little Children: mode&s;t, unambitious, teachable as they. Like them, we mu&s;t be <HI>born again;</HI> we mu&s;t begin to live again: begin another kind of Life: pur&s;ue a quite different End, by quite different Mea&s;ures. Like a weaned Child, mu&s;t be weaned from Creatures, and the things we were formerly fond of. But I would not enlarge here.</P>
<P>I proceed</P>
<P>To &s;hew <HI>what we are to under&s;tand by the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> &s;poken of in the Text. <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the KING|DOM OF HEAVEN.</HI> I &s;hall not be long in explaining this Phra&s;e. The <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of</HI> GOD, are principally u&s;ed in the Evangeli&s;ts for the State of the Go&s;pel in This World; or the Rewards of it in the Fu|ture. Sometimes it means the <HI>Kingdom of Grace;</HI> and &s;ome|times the <HI>Kingdom of Glory.</HI> And I &s;uppo&s;e that tho' the Text may ultimately refer to the Latter, yet it takes in the former al&s;o. And therefore we &s;hall con&s;ider them both.</P>
<P><HI>Except we be converted and become as little Children, we &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Without this we cannot enter into the <HI>Kingdom of Grace.</HI> God cannot receive us as his Favourites even in This World, till we have had this Change pa&s;&s;ed upon us. He will take no Delight in us, while we openly neglect him, and &s;et up Self and Creatures in his Throne. We may in|deed belong to his Kingdom of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and he may have De|&s;igns for our Salvation before our Conver&s;ion: But we are by no means Subjects in this Kingdom of <HI>Grace</HI> before this. By no means intitled to his Special Favours, and the Objects of his peculiar Delight.</P>
<P>We may indeed belong to the Vi&s;ible Kingdom of CHRIST in the World, and not be &s;avingly Converted. We may be Members of his Church here, and eat and drink in his Pre|&s;ence, and yet he know nothing of us. But here too, in or|der to our being worthy Gue&s;ts at this &s;acred Fea&s;t, Conver&s;ion is a nece&s;&s;ary Preparation. <HI>Friend how came&s;t thou in hither, not having a wedding Garment?</HI></P>
<P>But</P>
<P>Without this Conver&s;ion before we cannot enter into the <HI>Kingdom of Glory.</HI> Rev. xxi. 27. <HI>There &s;hall in no wi&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="041920_0008_101B6CA8507E80F0">
enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither what&s;oever worketh abomination.</HI> And not only has GOD <HI>declared</HI> this, all over his New Te&s;tament, but it is impo&s;&s;ible even in the <HI>Nature of the Thing.</HI> The principal Happine&s;s in the Kingdom of Glory is, in being perfectly conformed to the Will of GOD: And this, we know, is only attainable by Conver&s;ion. We entertain ju&s;ter Ideas of Heaven, when we apprehend it as a <HI>State</HI> than a <HI>Place.</HI> There is indeed &s;uch a glorious Place; but we know not where, or what it is. But as to the Temper and Happine&s;s of this Holy World, this every Good Man feels a little of in his own Brea&s;t. What do they do in Heaven? What do they Enjoy there? Truly they prai&s;e GOD; they love GOD; they &s;eek their whole Happine&s;s in GOD; and are perfectly conformed to his Will. And now, how can an Unconverted Man enter that glorious World? His whole Soul is bent upon Self and Creatures; here he terminates, and he knows nothing further. Should &s;uch a Soul but once get into the Man&s;ions of Glory, he would be like a Swine in a Golden Palace: He'd be quite out of his Element; and long for the Puddle and the Mire again. Like <HI>Uzziah</HI> with his Lepro&s;y in the holy place, 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. <HI>And Azariah the chief Prie&s;t, and all the Prie&s;ts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his Forehead, and they thru&s;t him out from thence, yea, him&s;elf ha&s;ted al&s;o to go out.</HI> So would be the Ca&s;e of the Polluted Soul in the Holy Heavens. Not only would the holy <HI>Angels,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;t Spirits drive</HI> him out from among them, but he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> would <HI>ha&s;te</HI> al&s;o to <HI>go out.</HI> What &s;hould he do there? His Soul has no turn to this Sort of Happine&s;s. Unmortified Lu&s;ts and raging Appetites, Pride, and Sen&s;uality, and Self-Will would be a Hell in his own Bo&s;om, amid&s;t all the Glories of Heaven. His whole Nature mu&s;t be changed; he mu&s;t be converted, and begin a New Life, or he could never enter into that ble&s;&s;ed State. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you&punc; Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured as clearly as I could, to explain and demon&s;trate the Doctrine, and I come now to the Sole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> Application.</P>
<P>Shall not the Unconverted enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <HI>Where then &s;hall they go?</HI> They mu&s;t go &s;ome|where. They are in Being, and they mu&s;t exi&s;t for ever.
<PB N="12" REF="041920_0009_101B6CAC101F6930">
<HI>Here</HI> they cannot always live: In a few Days more they mu&s;t leave the Earth; not &s;uffered to tarry by Rea&s;on of Death. To <HI>Heaven</HI> they cannot go. They have no Part there; nothing to do there; The voice of CHRIST, like a Flaming Sword, guards the Pa&s;&s;age again&s;t them. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, they &s;hall not enter</HI> there. Well then, what will become of them! O fearful, de&s;titute, ruined State! The infallible Word of GOD informs us where the mi&s;erable Creatures mu&s;t take up their Eternal Lodging, Matt. xxv. 46. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI> Mark ix. 43, 48&punc; into <HI>the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched: where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI> Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <HI>The &s;ame &s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of</HI> GOD, <HI>which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his Indig|nation, and he &s;hall be tormented with Fire and Brim&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the holy Angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb; and the Smoke of their Torment a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no re&s;t day nor night.</HI> He that over|cometh, indeed, &s;hall inherit all things: He that is converted and has his Nature changed, &s;hall enter into the World of Glory: <HI>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and &s;orcerers, and idolaters&punc; and all liars, &s;hall have their Part in the lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone which is the &s;econd Death,</HI> Rev. xxi. 7, 8. See now the Place to which the unconverted mu&s;t go! See the gloomy Landskip of that infernal World&punc; And O, are we not amazed? are we not in Agony, about our e&s;cape from this Ruin? Who can dwell with devouring Fire? who can dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings? Is not the Ca&s;e awful and dreadful? And do not our Hearts quiver, and our Souls &s;ink and die within us? Behold&punc; Life and Death &s;et before us: Eternal Life, and Eternal Fire; and are they in&s;ignifi|cant Things! O the Madne&s;s! if they make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon us. On the one Hand we are informed, <HI>Repent and be converted&punc; and your Sins &s;hall be blotted out;</HI> on the other, <HI>Except ye be converted ye &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Nay, we mu&s;t take up our eter|nal Abode in the World of Darkne&s;s, and Fire, and Chains. Ah! mi&s;erable Ca&s;e of Unconverted Men! Who would not fear, who would not fly their Doom? And therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="041920_0010_101B6CAFAEC1E110">Shall we not, my Brethren, <HI>labour in&s;tantly after the Con|ver&s;ion</HI> which alone can &s;ave us?</P>
<P><HI>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye die.</HI> Con&s;ider the matter&punc; and debate it with your own Hearts. Conver&s;ion begins in &s;e|rious Con&s;ideration. <HI>I thought on my ways, and turned my Feet unto thy Te&s;timonies,</HI> was the good old way, P&s;al. cxix. 59. Let us then go alone, and put the Ca&s;e to our &s;elves, <Q>Am I converted or not? What Happine&s;s am I pur&s;uing; a Happine&s;s in the Creature, or a Happine&s;s in the Enjoy|ment of GOD? Can I think that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Temporal Good can make me Happy? Have I not often made the Experiment already; and have I not as often been di&s;appointed? And why &s;hould I try any more? Is it not high Time for me to <HI>turn about,</HI> and &s;ee if I cannot find that Happine&s;s in GOD, which till now I have in vain &s;ought for in Objects below him?</Q> Propo&s;e the&s;e Que&s;tions to your own Souls, and &s;ee what an&s;wer your Con&s;cience will frame upon them.</P>
<P>Now be convinced that you cannot give this Turn to your &s;elves. Learn to feel and be &s;en&s;ible how attached to Self and Creatures you are. Mourn it, and confe&s;s it before GOD, and tell him how undone you are without his Almighty Grace&punc; Plead with Him, in Tears and Agony, to change your vile Nature: to turn you &s;avingly to Him&s;elf. Be importunate, be re&s;tle&s;s till you find this done for you: Till you find a Soul intirely for&s;aking the Creature and pur&s;uing its whole Satisfaction in GOD alone. 'Till CHRIST appears tran&s;|cendently dear and lovely to you; and you can joyfully leave this World to go to His Arms and his Bo&s;om. This divine and &s;aving Turn of Soul, may be given to you, as you are in the U&s;e of the&s;e appointed Means labouring to obtain it.</P>
<P>And <HI>let tho&s;e of us who have been converted, live becoming the Change we are under.</HI> Be thankful, be joyful: thankful to the God who has turn'd us, and joyful that we are pa&s;&s;ing to Heaven. Let us labour more and more after the Heaven|ly Temper: Love GOD more; think on him&punc; work for him, long and wi&s;h to be with him. If ever we find a pre|vailing Fondne&s;s for Creatures after this; if ever we find our Wills going to rebel, or our De&s;ires tend to this World; let us immediately check the inordinate Affection, and &s;ay, <Q>No. I have renounced the&s;e long ago. I have cho&s;en
<PB N="14" REF="041920_0011_101B6CB14AAFC760">
GOD for my Portion, and his Will for my Law long ago. GOD forbid, that after having e&s;caped the Snare, I &s;hould be again taken and entangled therein. No, No, farewell Creatures; no more &s;hall you tempt me from my true Happine&s;s. Farewell the Riches I once coveted; the Ap|plau&s;e I once gra&s;p'd after; the Plea&s;ures that looked &s;o charming. Farewell Felicity on Earth: and welcome the Will of my GOD: welcome Everla&s;ting Life. Welcome the Good Things of Earth, which my GOD plea&s;es to give me: But adieu all Thoughts of Happine&s;s in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e. Welcome Afflictions too; the Gifts of my GOD, and the Purcha&s;e of my SAVIOUR. Shall I re|ceive Good at his Hands, and not receive Evil? 'Tis the Cup which my Father gives me, why &s;hould I not drink it! Other Lords have had Dominion over me: But what have I any more to do with Idols?</Q></P>
<P>And while we are thus awakening the Piety of our own Souls, how &s;hould we pity a mi&s;erable World about us? Unhap|py Creatures! they know not what this Love to GOD means. They never felt what it was to be re&s;igned to the Will of GOD, and &s;wallowed up in his Love and his Prai&s;es. They are, as we once were, chained down to Sen&s;e and Creatures; and have no Idea of Conver&s;ion and the New Birth. You may talk to them eternally of the&s;e things; but they di&s;cern them not: you had as good go to explain the My&s;tery of Colours to a Man born blind. Ah, Poor Men! how &s;hould we pity and pray for them: How &s;hould we contrive to &s;hew them their Danger and Mi&s;ery; and labour with them to make their e&s;cape? Remember, <HI>He that converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, &s;hall &s;ave a Soul from Death.</HI> Sure we never need envy them the little Good they po&s;&s;e&s;s: But O how &s;hould we admire the Free Grace which has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed us from them! There's no Room for boa&s;ting in the Ca&s;e. 'Tis all &s;overeign, and all free: To GOD belongs the Glory; and to us Wonder, and Gratitude, and Humility.</P>
<P>We draw on towards a Conclu&s;ion. And how can we leave off better than with a View of that Heavenly World &s;poken of in the Text? This then &s;hall clo&s;e the whole.</P>
<P><HI>What a Holy and Happy Place is the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> There is not one <HI>&s;inful Per&s;on,</HI> not one <HI>&s;inful

Frame</HI> in that World. The Spirits of <HI>Ju&s;t men</HI> are <HI>made perfect</HI> before they are admitted there. Tho' the Good Man <HI>here</HI> loves GOD above all, and choo&s;es his Portion in him, yet this gracious Temper is often &s;hock'd and broken by Temptations and Indwelling Sin. But <HI>There</HI> is no Sin, no Corruption, no Tempter. All the Employment, all the Con|ver&s;ation, and every Thought is about GOD and his Glories. <HI>Alleluia, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth!</HI> This is the Language, the Temper, the Employment, the Felicity of Heaven. There, they are <HI>fill'd with all the Fulne&s;s of GOD.</HI> There, <HI>GOD is all in all.</HI> In that happy World, every In|habitant, and every Object, glorifies GOD and is filled with his Glory. His Perfections and his Love take them intirely up; and nothing al&s;o is &s;een, or heard, or thought of. O hap|py, happy State! The Converted Soul knows a <HI>little</HI> what this means: but what it <HI>fully</HI> is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>not now,</HI> we <HI>&s;hall know hereafter. Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor can the Heart of man conceive it all.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, ye Converted Souls, are the Joys &s;et before you! The&s;e are the Glories, and this the Felicity re&s;erved in Heaven for you. Here you perceive a <HI>little Ta&s;te</HI> of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> your Conformity to the Will of GOD; There you &s;hall &s;et down to the <HI>full Fea&s;t,</HI> and be <HI>perfectly</HI> conformed to his Will. Here the Joy of the LORD <HI>enters into you;</HI> There <HI>you &s;hall enter into the Joy of your Lord.</HI></P>
