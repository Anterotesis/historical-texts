<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned by the honorable, learned and pious Founder for the third in the quadrennial cour&s;e of his Lectures, is "to be for the detecting, and convicting and expo&s;|ing the idolatry of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, their tyranny, u&s;urpations, damnable here&s;ies, fatal errors, abominable &s;uper&s;titions and other crying wickedne&s;&s;es in their high places; and finally to prove that the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is that my&s;tical <HI>Babylon,</HI> that man of &s;in, that apo&s;tate church, &s;poken of in the New-Te&s;tament."</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who have preceded me in this Lecture, have con&s;idered and confuted the arguments urged by the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> in proof of the <HI>infallibility</HI> of their Church,<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wiggle&s;worth, A. D. 1757.</NOTE> and of the <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> of the <HI>Bi&s;hop

<P>The part which I &s;hall take in this controver&s;y, will be to con&s;ider one of the grand &s;ources of the fatal errors, and gro&s;s corruptions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church. The words of my text will naturally lead me to con&s;ider the AUTHORITY which the church of <HI>Rome</HI> a&s;&s;igns to TRADITION, and to point out &s;ome of the fatal con&s;equences of it. They are the reply of our Saviour to the Phari&s;ees, who found fault with his di&s;ciples for &s;itting down to their meals, with|out taking care previou&s;ly to clean&s;e them&s;elves from any pollutions they might have contracted. This conduct of his di&s;ciples the Phari&s;ees charge with being a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the tradition of the Elders. Our Saviour from thence takes occa&s;ion to reprehend them for the &s;uper&s;titious regard they paid to tho&s;e traditions. He charges them with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, by means of that regard, the commandment of God. In &s;upport of the charge he in&s;tances in their tra|dition re&s;pecting the conduct of children towards their parents. "God, &s;aith he, has commanded by Mo&s;es, &s;aying, honour thy father and thy mother;" and hath enforced this precept by that awful &s;anction, "Who|&s;o cur&s;eth his father or mother, let him &s;urely die." "But ye &s;ay, Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay to his father or
<PB N="7" REF="016171_0006_0F9BCD0814E5AF88">his mother, that, by which thou mighte&s;t be pro&s;ited by me, is a gift," devoted to &s;ome pious purpo&s;e, and neglects "to honour his father or his mother," either by not paying them that re&s;pect which is due from children to their parents, or by refu&s;ing to afford them that relief which their nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances may require, "he &s;hall be free" from the obligation of the divine command. In this manner the Phari&s;ees made the commandment of God of none effect by their tradition.</P>
<P>To &s;hew, that the charge which Chri&s;t brings again&s;t the Phari&s;ees, may, with equal ju&s;tne&s;s, be brought again&s;t the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> I &s;hall, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, endeavour at this time,</P>
<P>Faithfully to &s;tate the tenets of that church, re|&s;pecting <HI>tradition:</HI>&mdash;then,</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the force of the arguments, urged in &s;upport of tho&s;e tenets:&mdash;and la&s;tly,</P>
<P>Shew that the &s;etting up <HI>oral tradition</HI> as of equal authority with the &s;acred Scriptures, has opened the door for the admi&s;&s;ion of doctrines and precepts into that church, &s;ubver&s;ive of tho&s;e delivered by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be done, is &s;aithfully to &s;tate the tenets of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> re&s;pecting <HI>tradi|tion.</HI>&mdash;Before the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> the Word of God contained in the <HI>canonical</HI> books of &s;acred Scripture, was received by the Chri&s;tian Church, and acknow|ledged, as the <HI>only</HI> rule of faith and practice. All the doctrines to be believed by Chri&s;tians, and all the
<PB N="8" REF="016171_0007_0F9BCD08D056DC80">duties to be practi&s;ed by them, were confe&s;&s;edly, either expre&s;sly contained in the holy Scriptures, or el&s;e plainly to be proved by them, by ju&s;t and ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. But when the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Council of Trent</HI> were re&s;olved not to reform the errors and corruptions of the church, which were grown to an amazing height before the Reformation; and when they found that their doctrine of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation,</HI> of <HI>purgatory,</HI> of <HI>&s;even &s;acraments;</HI> and their practice of <HI>wor&s;hipping &s;aints, images, and relicks,</HI> of reading the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the <HI>&s;ervice of God</HI> in an <HI>unknown tongue,</HI> were not to be proved by the Scrip|tures, they deemed it expedient to &s;tretch and en|large the rule of faith and practice beyond its ancient limits. Such ab&s;urd doctrines and &s;uper&s;titious prac|tices not being warranted by the Scriptures, they judged it expedient to augment the Canon of Scrip|ture, by the addition of &s;everal <HI>apocryphal</HI> books to the Old Te&s;tament; books never received by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, to which were committed the ancient Oracles of God; becau&s;e they were compo&s;itions merely human, written by unin&s;pired per&s;ons, after the &s;pirit of prophecy had cea&s;ed in that church. And after the rule of their faith and practice had received this addition, le&s;t it &s;hould not yet be large enough for their purpo&s;e, they were plea&s;ed to add to it the <HI>unwritten word,</HI> or <HI>oral tradition.</HI> This the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> has declared to be of <HI>equal authority</HI> with the &s;acred Scriptures them&s;elves, and that it ought to be received with the <HI>&s;ame pious reverence and affection.</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Pari pietatis affectu ac reverentia &s;u&s;cipit, ac veneratur.</NOTE> To ju&s;tify their &s;etting up <HI>oral tradition</HI> as equal in authority with the <HI>written word</HI> of God, the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> tell us, that the books of the New-Te&s;tament
<PB N="9" REF="016171_0008_0F9BCD0990F7FA98">were <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> written, and not with a de&s;ign of making them the <HI>only</HI> rule of faith and practice. Many things, &s;ay they, were <HI>orally</HI> deli|vered by the Apo&s;tles, which they did not commit to writing; things of equal authority, and entitled to the &s;ame re&s;pect that is due to their writings. That we may not be at a lo&s;s where to find the things <HI>orally delivered,</HI> but <HI>not written,</HI> the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> inform us, that their church, which is the <HI>keeper,</HI> and as occa&s;ion may require, the <HI>publi&s;her of them,</HI> hath &s;afely and infallibly conveyed them down to us by tradition. The&s;e traditions, &s;ay they, were in the church long before &s;uch occa&s;ional publications of them. They have, from age to age, been handed down, by the church, from the very Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves. And the evidence of their being apo&s;tolical, is as good as that which re&s;pects the things that the Apo&s;tles committed to writing. Be&s;ides all this, &s;ome of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church maintain, that it appears from the <HI>Scriptures</HI> them&s;elves, that we ought to &s;ubmit to the te&s;timony of the church, when &s;he declares what things are to be received as articles of faith. We mu&s;t, therefore, believe &s;he truly di&s;pen&s;es the traditions received from the Apo&s;tles; even though the particulars &s;he declares are not to be proved by Scripture. The Council of <HI>Trent</HI> having, in this manner, fitted a rule for their particular pur|po&s;e, laid a foundation for proceeding with ea&s;e in confirming and proving whatever doctrines and prac|tices they had a mind to e&s;tabli&s;h, let them be ever &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, ab&s;urd or impious.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who embrace the Reformation agree with the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> that the Apo&s;tles taught the Chri&s;tians
<PB N="10" REF="016171_0009_0F9BCD0A50F1F3A0">of their day &s;everal things which we do not find in their writings. Could the&s;e be a&s;certained, they would be equal in authority, and entitled to the &s;ame reverence and re&s;pect with the apo&s;tolic wri|tings: But not being committed to writing, they are now lo&s;t. From the Scripture it&s;elf it is evident, that &s;ome things taught by the Apo&s;tles, were not written by them. From St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s telling the <HI>The&s;&s;a|lonians,</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Epi&s;t. ii. 6.</NOTE> that "they knew what with-held the reve|lation of the man of &s;in," it is manife&s;t that he, or &s;ome other in&s;pired per&s;on, had made known to them what was the ob&s;tacle to his being revealed. But this is no where expre&s;sly declared in the &s;acred Scriptures. It would be vain to imagine this to be the only in&s;tance of apo&s;tolic in&s;truction, not com|mitted to writing: It is highly probable there were other in&s;tances now lo&s;t. Uncertainty is always the concomitant of tho&s;e things, which have only <HI>oral tradition</HI> for the means of their conveyance down &s;o long a tract of time, as from the apo&s;tolic age to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P><HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are al&s;o ready to acknowledge, that the chri&s;tian writers of the fir&s;t ages of the church may &s;ometimes give light, and lead to the probable &s;en&s;e of &s;ome text of Scripture, which without &s;uch help would be quite ob&s;cure. From the writings of &s;ome of the Fathers it is probable, that it was the &s;trength and greatne&s;s of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, which hindered the revelation of the man of &s;in. The di&s;&s;olution of that empire was to open a door of entrance to him, when he made his appearance in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> allow further, that the <HI>general practice</HI> of the church, where it can be accurately a&s;certained,
<PB N="11" REF="016171_0010_0F9BCD0B10AC72A8">is a good commentary on tho&s;e texts which treat of the government, di&s;cipline or practice of the primi|tive, chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are far from agreeing with the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> which declares that the <HI>oral</HI> traditions of the <HI>catholic</HI> church meaning the <HI>Roman,</HI> were to be received with equal reverence and re&s;pect, as the books of the old and new Te&s;tament; and that he, who de&s;pi&s;eth tho&s;e traditions, is ACCURSED. On the other hand, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> churches maintain the Scriptures of the old and new Te&s;tament to be a PERFECT RULE of <HI>faith and practice.</HI> They do not indeed pretend, as has been noticed already, that every thing which was &s;aid or done, by our Saviour or his Apo&s;tles, is contained in them; or that they lay down particular rules for the management of all the prudential affairs of the chri&s;tian church. With re&s;pect to our Saviour, the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John</HI> informs us,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ch xx. ver. 30.</NOTE> "that many other &s;igns were done by Je&s;us in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples," which are not recorded in the Go&s;pel. And from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s direction to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Epi&s;t. xiv 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> to "let all things be done decently and in order," it is evident that &s;ome of the affairs of that church were le&s;t to be managed as their prudence &s;hould direct. In like manner, every chri&s;tian church is at liberty to provide for it&s;elt, where no provi&s;ion is made in the Scriptures. Care, however, mu&s;t be taken that &s;uch provi&s;ion be <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>orderly;</HI> that it does not tran&s;gre&s;s any of the rules of the Go&s;pel; nor en|join any thing as nece&s;&s;ary, either to church commu|nion, or to &s;alvation, which is not made &s;o by Chri&s;t, the only Legi&s;lator of the chri&s;tian church. <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="016171_0011_0F9BCD0D77799D48">only maintain that every thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, whether it relates to faith or practice, is either expre&s;sly contained in the Scriptures, or may by ju&s;t con&s;equence be deduced from them. As to <HI>oral</HI> tradition, it is e&s;teemed by them a way of con|veyance, from an age &s;o di&s;tant as the apo&s;tolic, too uncertain to be depended on; e&s;pecially in convey|ing down the knowledge of &s;uch doctrinal truths, or practical precepts, as are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to &s;olvation.</HI> And though it mu&s;t be allowed that the revelations made in one age of the world have been le&s;s perfect than tho&s;e made in another; the earlier revelations containing fewer articles, and being often le&s;s per|&s;picuous than the later, yet the nece&s;&s;ity of adding <HI>oral tradition</HI> cannot, from this cau&s;e, be conclu&s;ively argued. For God has in every age of the church revealed ALL that was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be believed and practi&s;ed in each particular age. And he has made his revelations with that degree of <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> which was nece&s;&s;ary compleatly to an&s;wer all his purpo&s;es in making them. The chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, being the la&s;t which is to take place in the world, every article of faith, and every rule of duty, is either ex|pre&s;sly contained in the &s;acred Scriptures of the old and new Te&s;tament, or may fairly and conclu&s;ively be deduced from them. No &s;ingle per&s;on, nor any collective bodies of men, have a right to pre&s;cribe any other articles of faith or rules of duty than what are contained in tho&s;e &s;acred writings. Every per&s;on, who&s;e li&s;e is properly influenced and governed by the doctrine, and precepts of the holy Scriptures, will obtain the mercy of God to eternal life; notwith|&s;tanding he totally di&s;regards all tho&s;e <HI>oral traditions</HI> which the church of <HI>Rome</HI> pretends &s;he has conveyed
<PB N="13" REF="016171_0012_0F9BCD0E152D6EB8">down from Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, with as much certainty as the &s;acred Scriptures have been tran&s;|mitted to us.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> churches have &s;ufficient rea|&s;on for abiding by their opinion, re&s;pecting the <HI>per|fection of the &s;acred Scriptures,</HI> in every thing that concerns our eternal &s;alvation; and for rejecting the <HI>authority of oral tradition,</HI> as it is maintained in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church, may be fairly evinced.&mdash;For,</P>
<P><HI>Oral tradition</HI> has, from experience, been found a very uncertain way of conveying the knowledge of doctrinal truths, or matters of fact, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages. The longevity of the <HI>Antedilu|vians</HI> gave them the greate&s;t advantage for conveying the knowledge of the doctrines and duties of reli|gion to po&s;terity. Two per&s;ons might have con|veyed it down from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Abraham.</HI> For at the death of <HI>Adam, Methu&s;elah</HI> was above three hundred years old. And <HI>Methu&s;elah</HI> did not die, till <HI>Shem</HI> was almo&s;t an hundred, who lived above an hundred years after the birth of <HI>Abraham.</HI> Be&s;ides their lon|gevity, the fewne&s;s of religious truths to be con|veyed, gave them every advantage of doing it, with as much certainty as can attend oral tradition. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, a di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners had &s;pread it&s;elf univer&s;ally among the An|tediluvians. And by the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the tra|dition of tho&s;e few things, in which religion was then comprehended, was &s;o corrupted, that God &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary to correct it by making an immediate reve|lation to him; And that <HI>Abraham</HI> might not be corrupted by the <HI>idolatry,</HI> which was beginning to
<PB N="14" REF="016171_0013_0F9BCD0EDDC6F0A8">prevail in his father's family, God commanded him to for&s;ake his kindred and his country.&mdash;Further,</P>
<P>The <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution was attended with many advantages, peculiarly favourable to tradition. The law was &s;hort; and it was promulged at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> with &s;olemnities, that excited the wonder and a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the whole congregation of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> There were many rites and &s;everal fe&s;tivals appointed to keep up the remembrance of it. All the main acts of their religion were to be performed in one place, and by per&s;ons of one family, who were devoted to this particular &s;ervice. And all the males were obliged to attend the &s;ervice at the temple three times a year, which kept up a con&s;tant intercour&s;e among them. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and many other advantages in favour of tradition, that were pe|culiar to the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution, God did not &s;ee &s;it certainty of tradition. For the commanded <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to write the <HI>who&s;e law,</HI> as he him&s;elf had, with his own finger, written the <HI>ten commandments</HI> on tables of &s;tone.</P>
<P>The traditional method of conveying a revelation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be liable to much uncertainty, ari&s;ing both from involuntary mi&s;takes, and from de&s;igned, wilful and malicious fal&s;ifications. The credit of a report which pa&s;&s;es through many hands, depends on the <HI>integrity</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficiency of all the relators.</HI> Where-ever there is a &s;u&s;picion that any of them are de&s;icient in either of the&s;e qualifications, a propor|tional doubt will be entertained with re&s;pect to the things reported by them. The effect of an unre|corded revelation can neither be exten&s;ive, nor per|manent. It can reach but few per&s;ons; and it cannot
<PB N="15" REF="016171_0014_0F9BCD0FA06B1668">retain its full credibility, but for a &s;hort time. Was the knowledge of religious truths to be communicated <HI>orally,</HI> for many centuries together, by an innumera|ble multitude of per&s;ons, differing in their capacities, tempers, de&s;igns and intere&s;ts, it would be morally impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at any certainty about them.</P>
<P><HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> further alledge, that the conveyance of the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity by tradition, would have been attended with difficulties, peculiar to it&s;elf. The chri&s;tian religion was not, like the <HI>mo&s;aic,</HI> con|fined to one country and nation. It was early pro|pagated into countries very remote from each other, who&s;e inhabitants, differing in language as well as &s;ituation, maintained but little intercour&s;e with one another. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, had hi&s;tory been &s;ilent, it might rea&s;onably have been pre&s;umed, that &s;ome per&s;ons in tho&s;e di&s;tant countries would have corrupted the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. When this had taken place, the remotene&s;s of the countries, and the different languages of the inhabitants, would have rendered it extremely difficult to have rectified &s;uch mi&s;takes; had the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity been wholly dependent on tradition. During the lives of the Apo&s;tles, a remedy might have been had in &s;uch a ca&s;e. On application to &s;ome of them, the que&s;tion in controver&s;y, might have been decided. But after the decea&s;e of the Apo&s;tles, had not all the doctrines of chri&s;tianity been committed to writing, whenever a controver&s;y aro&s;e re&s;pecting any article of the chri&s;|tian religion, it mu&s;t have remained undecided; un|le&s;s it could be proved from the Scriptures that Chri&s;t had ve&s;ted &s;ome one per&s;on, or &s;ome body of men, with power to decide all controver&s;ies that &s;hould ari&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="016171_0015_0F9BCD105366D3D0">in the Church, in an authoritative manner. But that he has done &s;o, <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are not able to find &s;uf|ficient evidence; notwith&s;tanding all that the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> have offered to evince that the <HI>Pope,</HI> or a <HI>General Council,</HI> or <HI>both,</HI> are cloathed with &s;uch authority. Indeed, the proofs of Chri&s;tianity are of &s;o compli|cated a nature, that, were we altogether dependent on tradition for our knowledge of them, they could not have been made out, in &s;o clear and &s;atisfactory a manner, as is requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h articles of faith, and per&s;uade men to embrace them.</P>
<P><HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> further object, that our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, in their controver&s;ies with the Jews, do not ever appeal to tradition, but always to the Scriptures. Our Saviour never &s;ubmitted to tradition, though it was on many occa&s;ions urged again&s;t him. On the contrary, he reproached the Jews with making the commandment of God of none effect by their tradi|tions. He told them plainly, that they wor&s;hipped God in vain, when they taught for doctrines, the commandments of men. In all his di&s;putations with them, he invariably referred them to the Scriptures, and enjoined it on them to &s;earch the Scriptures; founding his injunction on the ju&s;tne&s;s of the per&s;ua|&s;ion they entertained concerning them. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">John v. 39.</NOTE> "In them, &s;aid he, ye think ye have eternal life, and they are" the very books "that te&s;tify of me." Our Saviour never once appeals to tradition, when he is ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, or his doctrine, again&s;t the cavils of the Jews.&mdash;In like manner, the Apo&s;tles con&s;tantly make their appeal to the Scriptures, in all their di&s;putes with them. They &s;et a high character on the <HI>Bereans</HI> for their examining the Scriptures, and comparing with them
<PB N="17" REF="016171_0016_0F9BCD111C2644B0">the very doctrines, preached among them by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. In the epi&s;tles to the <HI>Romans, Galatians</HI> and <HI>Hebrews,</HI> the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> pur&s;ues a chain of arguments in oppo&s;ition to the prejudices the Jews had imbibed again&s;t Chri&s;tianity. But we do not find him, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, deducing &s;o much as a &s;ingle argument from tradition. On the contrary, the merit of the cau&s;e, conte&s;ted between them, is re&s;ted wholly on evidence, derived from the Scrip|tures. This &s;ame Apo&s;tle, when he is enumerating to <HI>Timothy</HI> the advantages he derived from a religious education, mentions it as an eminent one, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Epi&s;t. iii. 15</NOTE> "that from a child he had known the HOLY SCRIPTURES, which were able to make him wi&s;e to Salvation, through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." If the Scriptures have been handed down from the Apo&s;tles to the pre&s;ent time, without corruption in tho&s;e articles that are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, either the Apo&s;tle, or the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> mu&s;t be mi&s;erably mi&s;taken. The Apo&s;tle tells <HI>Timothy, they</HI> are able to make him <HI>wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ays they are <HI>not &s;o,</HI> without the help of tho&s;e <HI>traditional articles,</HI> which &s;he has been &s;o happy as to convey down to us with infallible certainty. Which is entitled to the greate&s;t credit, the Apo&s;tle or the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> will &s;carcely be called in que&s;tion by any who have not learned the art of believing that an Apo&s;tle, writing under the guidance of the Holy Gho&s;t can commit an egregious blunder.&mdash;When the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> knew that his death was approaching, he wrote his &s;econd epi&s;tle for this very end, that his chri&s;tian brethren "might have the&s;e things," namely, the doctrines and precepts taught by him and the other Apo&s;tles, "always in remembrance." But why need he have
<PB N="18" REF="016171_0017_0F9BCD11D53F3198">been &s;o &s;olicitous to commit tho&s;e things to writing? Perhaps he never heard, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;o highly privileged as to be the keeper and conveyancer of tho&s;e in&s;tructions which the Apo&s;tles, either through hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, or through care|le&s;&s;ne&s;&s;, had neglected to commit to writing. But to be &s;erious, neither our Saviour, nor his Apo&s;tles, give the lea&s;t hint of their having left any "unwritten word," with the Church, to be by her conveyed down to &s;ucceeding ages by <HI>oral tradition:</HI> Much le&s;s have they given the lea&s;t intimation of their having le&s;t any articles <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation,</HI> to be in this manner conveyed down by the Church.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e the only rea&s;ons for rejecting the tra|ditions of the Church of <HI>Rome, Prote&s;tants</HI> would e&s;teem them&s;elves fully ju&s;tified in totally di&s;regarding them.&mdash;But this brings me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That the very &s;uppo&s;al of a nece&s;&s;ity of adding <HI>oral tradition</HI> to &s;cripture revelation, implies &s;ome <HI>im|perfection</HI> in the Scriptures. On this &s;uppo&s;ition the Scriptures mu&s;t, either <HI>not contain</HI> all things nece&s;&s;ary to be believed and practi&s;ed, in order to obtain &s;alva|tion, or el&s;e <HI>not deliver</HI> the articles of faith and prac|tice with that degree of <HI>per&s;picuity,</HI> which was nece&s;|&s;ary compleatly to an&s;wer all the divine purpo&s;es in delivering them. Both of the&s;e have been openly taught and avowed by the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> even in a Pro|te&s;tant country, while they have been attempting to make pro&s;elytes to their Church. In a pamphlet di&s;per&s;ed in England in the former part of the pre|&s;ent century, it is a&s;ked, "<HI>Why &s;hould not the Scripture</HI> ALONE <HI>be the rule of faith?</HI>" To which the an&s;wer given is, "<HI>Becau&s;e &s;everal</HI> NECESSARY ARTICLES
<PB N="19" REF="016171_0018_0F9BCD129322D590"><HI>are either</HI> NOT AT ALL CONTAINED <HI>in Scripture, or at lea&s;t are</HI> NOT PLAIN <HI>in the Scripture without the help of tradition.</HI>" But the&s;e are po&s;itions, which <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> think ought not to be laid down, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of oral tradition.&mdash;For,</P>
<P>It may be clearly evinced, that every article of faith and practice, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, is contained in the Scriptures; even from a conce&s;&s;ion of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf. For that Church allows, "that the Scriptures are to be received by all chri&s;tians as the INFALLIBLE <HI>word of</HI> GOD" Now this infallible word declares, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 16, 17.</NOTE> "that all Scripture is given by in&s;pi|ration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re|proof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur|ni&s;hed to all good works." If by the man of God is to be under&s;tood a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> or <HI>Teacher</HI> in the chri&s;tian Church, then the Scripture is given to <HI>perfect</HI> him for his office; and <HI>throughly</HI> to furni&s;h him to all good works, belonging to his &s;tation. Or &s;hould the man of God be &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to a <HI>private chri&s;|tian,</HI> then the de&s;ign of the Scripture is to make him perfect, and throughly to furni&s;h him to all good works; compleatly qualifying him for the faithful di&s;charge of all the duties of his chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. On either &s;uppo&s;ition it will follow, that all nece&s;&s;ary articles of faith and practice are contained in the Scriptures. For they are profitable for <HI>doctrine,</HI> teach|ing us to form ju&s;t thoughts of the divine Maje&s;ty and of our&s;elves. They al&s;o teach us the way in which &s;inful man may become reconciled to God. They are profitable for <HI>reproof,</HI> for all the errors and fal&s;e doc|trines which have at any time been propagated, may
<PB N="20" REF="016171_0019_0F9BCD1350958778">be confuted by them. They are profitable for <HI>cor|rection,</HI> for they lay the &s;tricte&s;t prohibition on every kind of wickedne&s;s and on every degree of immo|rality. By convincing men of their &s;ins and their faults, they become the means of correcting them. They are profitable for <HI>in&s;truction</HI> in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> teaching all the rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s, even all the duties incumbent on chri&s;tians. The Scriptures are &s;o perfect for all the&s;e ends, as fully to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of God in giving them; which was, that <HI>the man of God,</HI> whether he be a teacher in the church, or only a private Chri&s;tian, may <HI>be made perfect, throughly furni&s;hed to all good works.</HI> Now, &s;hould it be admitted, that the Scriptures do not contain every article of faith and practice, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion, it will follow, either that the man of God may be <HI>perfect</HI> without the knowledge of &s;ome <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> articles of chri&s;tianity; or el&s;e, that God did not know what would be &s;ufficient to make him <HI>perfect.</HI> The former is a &s;elf-evident contradiction. To &s;up|po&s;e the latter of Him who&s;e under&s;tanding is in|finite, would be as fooli&s;h as it is bla&s;phemous.</P>
<P>Indeed from the whole current of the Scriptures we are led to conclude, that all the nece&s;&s;ary articles of faith and practice are contained in them. The Apo&s;tle John informs us, in the clo&s;e of his go&s;pel, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ch. xx. 30.</NOTE> that "the&s;e things were written, that we might be|lieve that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God; and and that believing <HI>we might have life</HI> through his name." So again in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ch. v. 13.</NOTE> he &s;ays, "the&s;e things have I written unto you&mdash;that ye might know that ye have eternal life." Now, &s;ince the di&s;ign of the Scriptures is to make known the way to eternal life; and &s;ince from them we may be
<PB N="21" REF="016171_0020_0F9BCD140EFBDC78">certain that we are entitled to it, it is evident that they mu&s;t contain all the articles nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. There can be no occa&s;ion for the help of <HI>oral tra|dition,</HI> to add any thing to <HI>their perfection.</HI></P>
<P>Should any thing then be taught by a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, or decreed by a particular church, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, which is not to be found in expre&s;s words in the Scriptures, nor to be deduced from them by ju&s;t con&s;equence, it may &s;afely be rejected; it cannot be an article of our holy religion. All &s;uch additions are mere perver&s;ions of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. The go&s;pel was &s;o fully preached by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;cruples not to denounce a mo&s;t &s;olemn cur&s;e again&s;t either an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> or an <HI>Angel from Heaven,</HI> who &s;hould pre|&s;ume to preach a go&s;pel different from that which had been preached by him. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 8.</NOTE> "Though <HI>we,</HI> &s;ays he, or an <HI>Angel from Heaven,</HI> preach any other go&s;pel, than that which we have preached unto you, <HI>let him be</HI> ACCURSED." To impre&s;s this the more, on the minds of the <HI>Galatians</HI> in the fir&s;t place, and then on the minds of all who &s;hould read this epi&s;tle, it is immediately repeated, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">ver&s;e 9.</NOTE> "As we &s;aid before, &s;o &s;ay I now again, if any man preach any other go&s;pel unto you, than that which ye have received, <HI>let him be</HI> ACCURSED." Surely then tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> communion, who declare there are &s;everal <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> things, <HI>not</HI> contained in the Scriptures, have rea&s;on to fear le&s;t this apo&s;tolic cur&s;e &s;hould come upon them. Till they can prove that &s;uch <HI>additional articles</HI> were <HI>orally</HI> delivered by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves; that they &s;tand on as good evidence, as tho&s;e articles do, which the Apo&s;tles committed to writing; and
<PB N="22" REF="016171_0021_0F9BCD14E10CF000">that the church has handed them down from the Apo&s;tles, pure and free from corruption, <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> will e&s;teem them&s;elves fully ju&s;tified in rejecting them.</P>
<P>Should the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> to free them&s;elves from the charge of incon&s;i&s;tency and &s;elf-contradiction, reply, "That the church of <HI>Rome</HI> allows the &s;ufficiency of Scripture to <HI>perfect</HI> the man of God, provided Scrip|ture be interpreted as the <HI>catholic,</HI> meaning the <HI>Roman</HI> church, directs; and that there be al&s;o a holding fa&s;t <HI>tho&s;e traditions,</HI> to which the <HI>written word refers,</HI>" it will not an&s;wer their purpo&s;e. This written word declares, that <HI>as written</HI> it is profitable for all the afore mentioned purpo&s;es. The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> affirm there are <HI>other articles,</HI> not con|tained in it, pre&s;erved by the church and handed down by tradition, which are <HI>equally nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to tho&s;e ends. Now to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>written word</HI> of God is infallibly true, which declares that the Scrip|tures are able to make men <HI>wi&s;e to &s;alvation through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and to make the man of God <HI>perfect;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;ert, that they are <HI>not able,</HI> without the addition of &s;ome <HI>other</HI> NE|CESSARY <HI>articles,</HI> carries &s;o much the appearance of ab&s;urdity and &s;elf-contradiction, that it will require no &s;mall &s;hare of the art and &s;ubtilty of a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> to free &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions from it.</P>
<P>To palliate this incon&s;i&s;tency, the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> plead, 'that the Scriptures them&s;elves refer to <HI>traditions,</HI> which are to be held fa&s;t, as well as the things that are written.' To this purpo&s;e they quote a pa&s;&s;age from the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians:</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ch. ii. 15.</NOTE> "There|fore,
<PB N="23" REF="016171_0022_0F9BCD159124DEC8">brethren, &s;tand fa&s;t, and hold the <HI>traditions</HI> which ye have been taught, whether by <HI>word,</HI> or our <HI>epi&s;tle.</HI>" Upon this pa&s;&s;age one of their writers makes this ob&s;ervation. "Hence it is clear, that <HI>&s;ome tra|ditions</HI> were delivered to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> by <HI>word of mouth,</HI> and tho&s;e of EQUAL <HI>authority</HI> with what was <HI>written,</HI> if not more; for the Holy Gho&s;t doth name them <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as they were indeed the fir&s;t in being." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Touch&s;tone of the reformed Go&s;pel.</NOTE> And <HI>Bellarmine</HI> &s;aith, "that the Apo&s;tle commands that they <HI>no le&s;s</HI> ob&s;erve what they had received WITHOUT <HI>writing,</HI> than what they had received by <HI>epi&s;tle.</HI>" To ju&s;tify their interpretation of this text, and to &s;hew its pertinency to the point for which it is alledged, it is incumbent on the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> to make it evident, that the <HI>traditions</HI> which the <HI>The&s;&s;a|lonians</HI> were taught by <HI>word,</HI> were different from tho&s;e taught by <HI>epi&s;tle;</HI> and that tho&s;e <HI>verbal tradi|tions</HI> were never committed to <HI>writing,</HI> by per&s;ons under the guidance of the holy Spirit; but left with the church to be carefully pre&s;erved and delivered down <HI>orally</HI> to &s;ucceeding ages, as circum&s;tances may require. To &s;et the matter in a ju&s;t point of light, it may be ob&s;erved, that whatever <HI>traditions nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation</HI> the Apo&s;tle delivered to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> by EPISTLE, the &s;ame he had before delivered to them by <HI>word of mouth. Bellarmine</HI> him&s;elf is con|&s;trained to acknowledge, "that without doubt the Apo&s;tle had <HI>fully preached the whole go&s;pel</HI> to them." The traditions, then, referred to in the text, were &s;uch as the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> had been taught <HI>before,</HI> by the &s;ame Spirit and by the &s;ame per&s;on, who indited this epi&s;tle. Whereas the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> refer to <HI>tradi|tions</HI> of which no traces can be found for <HI>&s;everal hundred years</HI> after the whole canon of Scripture
<PB N="24" REF="016171_0023_0F9BCD164EE63198">was compleated. Now it is readily granted, that where the things <HI>&s;poken</HI> are the &s;ame with tho&s;e afterwards <HI>written,</HI> they are of equal authority. For the authority of divine truths is not at all affected by the manner in which the knowledge of them is communicated. The Apo&s;tle, however, by joining <HI>word</HI> and <HI>letter</HI> together, does not de&s;ign to in&s;inuate that the things taught them by <HI>letter</HI> were <HI>different</HI> from what he had before taught them by <HI>word of mouth.</HI> For in the 5th ver&s;e of this very chapter, wherein he charges them to hold fa&s;t the <HI>traditions</HI> they had been taught, he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts that what he was then actually writing, he had told them before. "Remember ye not, &s;ays he, that when I was yet with you, I told you the&s;e things." Whereas the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> bring this text to &s;upport the authority of &s;uch traditions as enjoin things not commanded in Scripture, or el&s;e &s;uch as alter the plain &s;en&s;e of it, and even &s;uch as expre&s;sly contradict it.</P>
<P>Should it be admitted that the pa&s;&s;age under con|&s;ideration refers to traditions, which at that time were not committed to writing; yet it will not &s;erve the purpo&s;e, for which the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> alledge it. For, at the time the Apo&s;tle gave this injunction to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> there was but a &s;mall part of the New-Te&s;tament committed to writing. Probably the epi&s;tle to the church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> recorded Acts XV. the two epi&s;tles to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> and the go&s;pels of <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark,</HI> were the only books of the New-Te&s;tament extant at that time. Now, it will not, &s;urely, follow becau&s;e, when things were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, the Apo&s;tle commanded the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> to hold fa&s;t what they had been taught by <HI>word,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="016171_0024_0F9BCD18C4029898">that other things, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, were left <HI>unwritten,</HI> to be handed down by <HI>oral tradition,</HI> after the canon of Scripture was compleat.</P>
<P>Should the modern <HI>Romani&s;t</HI> reply with Cardinal <HI>Perron.</HI> "We mu&s;t not an&s;wer that <HI>St. Paul</HI> &s;peaks here <HI>only</HI> of &s;uch traditions, which, though not in his epi&s;tle to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> yet were <HI>afterwards writ|ten,</HI> and in other books of Scripture; becau&s;e it is upon occa&s;ion of tradition touching the <HI>cau&s;e of the hindrance of the coming of Antichri&s;t,</HI> which was NEVER WRITTEN, that this injunction is laid down;" &s;hould the <HI>Romani&s;t</HI> make this reply, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> is ready to rejoin, that if the tradition there referred to, which the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> had &s;uch a &s;olemn charge to hold fa&s;t, <HI>be yet</HI> LOST, becau&s;e it was not committed, to writing, we can have little or no rea&s;on to pay any regard to other oral traditions, which are no ways concerned in the apo&s;tolic injunction. This very plea of the Cardinal furni&s;hes us with a good rea&s;on why the church of <HI>Rome</HI> or even the <HI>catholic</HI> Church, &s;hould not be e&s;teemed a &s;ure pre&s;erver of oral tra|ditions. It is, indeed, a conclu&s;ive argument again&s;t all preten&s;ions of that kind. This text, then, can never be admitted by <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> as evidence &s;uffi|cient to convince them, that "the traditions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church are to be received with equal piety and reverence as the books of the old and new Te&s;tament."</P>
<P>In like manner the other texts urged by the Ro|mani&s;ts in favour of the traditions of their Church, are &s;ar from proving that any obligation lays on chri&s;tians to pay the lea&s;t regard to them. The&s;e texts relate <HI>only</HI> to the things <HI>delivered by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves;</HI> and have no concern with the traditions

According to the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> in&s;tead of remembering the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> we mu&s;t remember and reverence the <HI>authority</HI> of the <HI>church;</HI> and in&s;tead of keeping the traditions which the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> delivered, who on ano|ther occa&s;ion tells them, that what he delivered to them, he received of the Lord, we mu&s;t keep tho&s;e traditions which the <HI>Church</HI> delivers.&mdash;Again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. iii. 6.</NOTE> "We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly, and not after the <HI>tradition</HI> which <HI>he received of</HI> US." This US the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> apply to <HI>their Church,</HI> and urge this text in proof that Chri&s;tians ought to re|ceive <HI>their traditions;</HI> &s;uch as were delivered to them; <HI>not</HI> indeed by the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> but by <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Popes</HI> &s;everal hundred years after the canon of Scrip|ture was &s;ettled &mdash; The &s;ame Apo&s;tle charges <HI>Timothy</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 23.</NOTE> to "hold fa&s;t the <HI>form of &s;ound words</HI> which thou ha&s;t been taught of ME, in faith and love, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." By the <HI>form of &s;ound words</HI> the Ro|mani&s;ts under&s;tand all the <HI>traditionary articles</HI> of faith in their Church, though they are not to be found in the Apo&s;tle's writings.

<P>Till the Romani&s;ts are able to produce &s;ome better evidence than any that has yet been offered by them, <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> will find it hard to per&s;uade them&s;elves, that <HI>&s;everal articles nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation are</HI> NOT <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">T ALL CONTAINED IN THE SCRIPTURES: Much le&s;s will they be convinced by the evidence adduced by them, that the traditions of the church of <HI>Rome</HI> merit equal reverence with the &s;acred Scriptures.</P>

Iii. 16.</NOTE> "there are &s;ome things in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s epi&s;ties <HI>hard to he under&s;tood,</HI> which they that are unlearned and un&s;table <HI>wre&s;t,</HI> as they do al&s;o the other Scriptures to <HI>their own de&s;truction</HI>" From this text the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> conclude, that the <HI>unlearned</HI> part of mankind are in more danger of being hurt by having the Scriptures to read, than by being de|nied the u&s;e of them. Such &s;tre&s;s has been laid upon it by &s;ome of their writers, that on the authority of this pa&s;&s;age <HI>alone,</HI> they have determined "the Scrip|tures
<PB N="28" REF="016171_0027_0F9BCD1AD2107748">not to be &s;ufficiently clear in all points wherein our &s;alvation is concerned; but that the mi&s;under|&s;tanding and mi&s;interpreting them, may endanger our eternal &s;alvation."</P>
<P>On the other hand, Prote&s;tants allow that an equal degree of <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> does not attend all parts of the &s;acred Scriptures; that they contain &s;ome things of a very <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e</HI> nature, which after all our care and pains, we &s;hall not be able fully to comprehend. They do not, indeed, maintain that the articles ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation are treated with an equal degree of plainne&s;s in every place, where they are mentioned. For it &s;ufficiently an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of religion, if tho&s;e things which are handled but <HI>ob&s;curely</HI> in &s;ome places, are treated of with <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> in others. Neither do they pretend, but that per&s;ons of corrupt and vicious di&s;po&s;itions, who &s;tudy the Scriptures under &s;uch a bia&s;s, though they do it with con&s;i|derable attention, may fall into &s;ome &s;undamental errors or mi&s;takes. Neither do they affirm, that the things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, are delivered in &s;o plain a manner, as to be under&s;tood without u&s;ing &s;uch helps as are nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand other books and things of equal antiquity. &mdash; But Prote&s;tants do, indeed, maintain that every article of faith and practice, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, is delivered in &s;o <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>in|telligible</HI> a manner in the &s;acred Scriptures, that every per&s;on who &s;tudies them with a firm re&s;olution to yield his a&s;&s;ent to every doctrine, plainly revealed in them, and to practi&s;e all the duties they enjoin, will be pre&s;erved from every fatal error, and led into the knowledge of all nece&s;&s;ary truth: Provided he u&s;es all the helps which God in his providence affords him, and joins his fervent and per&s;evering prayer to God for a ble&s;&s;ing on his endeavours.</P>

<HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are fully per&s;uaded they do not a&s;cribe this degree of <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> to the &s;acred Scriptures without &s;ufficient rea&s;on.

Tho&s;e doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, which we are able fully to comprehend, are con&s;onant to our natural notions of the Deity; and tho&s;e which are too &s;ublime to be fully comprehended, appear, as &s;ar as we are able to apprehend them, worthy of God to reveal. Both one and the other have a direct ten|dency to inculcate holine&s;s; and by that means to quali&s;y mankind for the enjoyment of everla&s;ting felicity.

<P>Prote&s;tants are al&s;o fully per&s;uaded, that the <HI>per|&s;picuity</HI> of the Scriptures in all nece&s;&s;ary articles, may be fairly argued from the <HI>de&s;ign of God in making a revelation of his will.</HI> From a pa&s;&s;age already cited it appears, that the expre&s;s de&s;ign of God in giving the holy Scriptures by divine revelation, was "that the man of God may be <HI>perfect</HI> throughly furni&s;hed to all good works." Now &s;hould it be granted that the Scriptures, con&s;idered as a rule of faith and practice, are <HI>ab&s;olutely perfect;</HI> yet if this rule be delivered in &s;uch dark and intricate terms, as to be unintelligible to the very per&s;ons, for who&s;e u&s;e it was de&s;igned, it certainly can be <HI>no rule to them.</HI> On &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, neither their faith, nor their prac|tice, could be regulated by it.

<PB N="30" REF="016171_0029_0F9BCD1C53CA6BE8">that God, who is not only our <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> but our <HI>kind and compa&s;&s;ionate Father,</HI> &s;hould give us a rule of conduct, incapable of being comprehended.

<P><HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> further argue the <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> of the Scriptures from the <HI>te&s;timony of the Scriptures con|cerning them&s;elves.</HI> To this purpo&s;e are the words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx.

<P>From the&s;e evidences of the <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> of &s;acred Scriptures, the pre&s;umption is &s;trong that the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> make a fal&s;e inference from the words of St <HI>Peter,</HI> who &s;avs <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 16.</NOTE> that "in the epi&s;tles of <HI>Paul</HI> there are &s;ome things <HI>hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> which the unlearned and un&s;table <HI>wre&s;t,</HI> as they do the other Scriptures, to their own de&s;truction;" when they conclude from them, that the Scriptures are <HI>not &s;ufficiently clear</HI> in all points, wherein our &s;alvation is concerned; but that "the mi&s;under&s;tanding and mi&s;interpreting them, may endanger our eternal &s;alvation." And that they have actually made a fal&s;e inference, will appear from an attentive con&s;ideration of the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf. For,</P>
<P>The very thing which the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> bring this text to <HI>di&s;prove,</HI> is evidently implied in the words of the Apo&s;tle. It is only <HI>&s;ome things</HI> in the epi&s;tles of <HI>Paul</HI> and in the other Scriptures, that are <HI>hard to be under|&s;tood.</HI> The <HI>other things,</HI> therefore, are <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>intel|ligible.</HI> There is no danger of mi&s;under&s;tanding them; provided they are &s;tudied with care and attention, together with a &s;ixed determination to <HI>do,</HI> as well as to <HI>know the will of God.</HI> There is not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of keeping the Scriptures from the common people; for the Apo&s;tle allowed the free u&s;e of them to the <HI>unlearned</HI> otherwi&s;e they could not have <HI>wre&s;ted</HI> them.&mdash;Further,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are called <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>un&s;table</HI> by the Apo&s;tle, were not &s;uch as are called &s;o by the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> in this controver&s;y. They were not &s;uch per&s;ons as, in modern times, are e&s;teemed <HI>unlearned;</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="016171_0031_0F9BCD1DD5193EC0">namely, per&s;ons unacquainted with the liberal arts and &s;ciences: But they were &s;uch as had not learned the <HI>fundamental points of religion,</HI> and were un&s;ettled in the <HI>principles of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> They were per&s;ons of the &s;ame character with tho&s;e whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> com|pares <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 14.</NOTE> to "children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine." Such un&s;table per&s;ons may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of <HI>mi&s;under|&s;tanding,</HI> and even of <HI>wre&s;ting</HI> the Scriptures to <HI>their own de&s;truction;</HI> notwith&s;tanding that every article, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, is delivered with all needful plainne&s;s. To apply the words, therefore, to the <HI>illiterate part of mankind in general,</HI> and not to tho&s;e who are unlearned and un&s;ettled in the principles of Chri&s;tianity, is a &s;hameful perver&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice, that the Apo&s;tle does not forbid the&s;e very men the <HI>u&s;e of the Scriptures,</HI> or even the reading the things <HI>hard to be under&s;tood.</HI> Their de&s;truction was not owing to their reading them, but was wholly occa&s;ioned by their <HI>wre&s;ting</HI> and <HI>abu&s;ing them.</HI> Now, &s;ince the Apo&s;tle does not order the Scriptures to be kept from per&s;ons, who &s;o gro&s;sly abu&s;ed them, we may &s;afely conclude that he never intended they &s;hould be kept from the <HI>common people in general;</HI> merely becau&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons in every age might probably abu&s;e them, as the <HI>un&s;table</HI> then did. The true inference to be drawn from this text is directly contrary to the conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Romani&s;ts.</HI> In&s;tead of denving the common people the free u&s;e of the Scriptures, they ought rather to be exhorted to &s;tudy them with the greater care, diligence and humility; le&s;t they &s;hould be left to pervert them to their own de&s;truction, as the unlearned and un|&s;table did in the days of the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="016171_0032_0F9BCD1E91CF5F38">
It may be ob&s;erved further, that the things which the Apo&s;tle &s;ays are <HI>hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> and which were <HI>wre&s;ted</HI> by &s;ome to their de&s;truction, are things, of which Chri&s;tians may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be ignorant, without <HI>endangering</HI> their &s;alvation. They are not, as the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> maintain, things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation,</HI> which are &s;poken of, either with re&s;pect to <HI>Paul</HI>'s epi&s;tles, or to the other Scriptures. <HI>Peter</HI> had been treating, in the context, of the <HI>new heavens</HI> and the <HI>new earth,</HI> and of the <HI>di&s;&s;olution of the world</HI> at the &s;econd vi&s;ible coming of Chri&s;t. Concerning the&s;e &s;ubjects, which are al&s;o treated of in the other Scrip|tures, there are &s;everal things confe&s;&s;edly <HI>hard to be under&s;tood.</HI> But then, it is not nece&s;&s;ary, that the humble, believing Chri&s;tian &s;hould fully under&s;tand them, in order to this being &s;aved at Chri&s;t's &s;econd appearance. A general expectation of tho&s;e things, where there cannot be a full comprehen&s;ion of them, will &s;o influence the heart and life of a pious Chri&s;tian, that he will be found of his Judge in peace.</P>
<P>Further, there being &s;ome things in the Scriptures <HI>hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> ought not to be made an ob|jection again&s;t their per&s;picuity and utility. Some &s;ubjects, in their own nature, are more difficult than others; and require more &s;tudy and attention to un|der&s;tand them. Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch &s;ubjects are handled with ju&s;tne&s;s and propriety, and with as much per&s;picuity as they will admit, yet to ha&s;ty and in|con&s;iderate per&s;ons there may be &s;ome things con|cerning them, hard to be under&s;tood. This is fre|quently the ca&s;e with the mo&s;t judicious and accurate compo&s;itions. But then it mu&s;t be remembered, that the oftener and the more carefully &s;uch compo&s;itions are read, the better will they be under&s;tood, and the
<PB N="34" REF="016171_0033_0F9BCD1F53ECA1B8">more will they be admired. And this is a glory that does, by way of eminence, belong to the &s;acred Scriptures.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o worthy our ob&s;ervation, that the difficult pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture which have been abu&s;ed by &s;ome, have had a very good effect on others, even in the lower cla&s;&s;es of life. By endeavouring to attain a competent knowledge of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, they have been led into a more thorough acquaintance with the Scriptures in general; and have had their lives &s;uitably influenced by the important truths contained in them. Since the&s;e have been the happy effects of &s;tudying the <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e</HI> parts of Scripture, we may &s;afely abide by the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> doctrine, that THE SCRIPTURES ARE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND PERSPICUOUS IN ALL POINTS THAT IMMEDI|ATELY CONCERN OUR ETERNAL SALVATION.</P>
<P>Were the tenets of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> re&s;pecting tradition, merely the private &s;entiments of &s;ome &s;pe|culative men in that church, they would not have de&s;erved the notice we have taken of them. But when they are con&s;idered as the chief &s;upports of that amazing &s;abrick of worldly policy, which the Pope and his clergy have reared upon the foundation of Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles, they cannot undergo too &s;trict an examination. <HI>Tradition,</HI> or <HI>traditive</HI> inter|pretations of Scripture, lie as the foundation of all the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets of <HI>Popery.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> finding that, in many in&s;tances, &s;he failed of plain &s;criptural evidence to prove her avowed articles of faith and to ju&s;tify the practices &s;he had adopted, has di&s;covered her worldly wi&s;dom, by declaring <HI>tra|dition</HI> to be of equal authority with the Scriptures. However, by doing &s;o, &s;he has admitted to her

<P>In the bull of <HI>Pope</HI> PIUS IV. bearing date at <HI>Rome.</HI> A.D. 1564. printed with the acts of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> a FORM OF FAITH is drawn up, which was extracted from the decrees of that Council.

<P>"I plainly &s;ee, and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes again&s;t Popes, Councils again&s;t Councils, &s;ome Fathers again&s;t others, the &s;ame Fathers again&s;t them&s;elves, a con&s;ent of Fathers of one age again&s;t a con&s;ent of Fathers of another age, the Church of one age again&s;t the Church of another age: Traditive interpretations of Scripture are pretended, but there
<PB N="39" REF="016171_0038_0F9BCD251BCA5970">are few, or none to be found: No tradition but only of the Scripture, can derive it&s;elf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in &s;uch an age after Chri&s;t, or that &s;uch an age it was not in. In a word, there is no &s;ufficient <HI>certainty</HI> but of SCRIP|TURE <HI>only,</HI> for any con&s;idering man to build upon. <HI>This</HI> therefore, and <HI>this only,</HI> I have rea&s;on to believe: <HI>This</HI> I will profe&s;s, according to <HI>this</HI> I will live, and for <HI>this,</HI> it there be occa&s;ion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly, lo&s;e my life, though I &s;hould be &s;orry that Chri&s;tians &s;hould take it from me.</P>
<P>"Propo&s;e me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe it or no, and &s;eem it never &s;o in|comprehen&s;ible to human rea&s;on, I will &s;ub&s;cribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demon&s;tration can be &s;tronger than this, GOD HATH SAID SO, THEREFORE IT IS TRUE. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him; nei|ther &s;hall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the wor&s;e <HI>man.</HI> nor the wor&s;e <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> I will love no man <HI>the le&s;s,</HI> for differing in opinion from me. And what mea&s;ure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully a&s;&s;ured that God <HI>does</HI> not, and therefore men <HI>ought</HI> not to require any more of any man than this, <HI>to believe the Scripture to be God's word, to endeavour to &s;ind out the true &s;en&s;e of it, and to live according to it.</HI>"</P>
<P>That all, who receive their education in this place, may do &s;o, God of his infinite mercy grant, through Je&s;us Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>
