<P>IT is a very remarkable &s;aying of our Lord and Sa|viour to his di&s;ciples: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are your eyes, for they &s;ee; and your ears, for they hear.</HI> It teaches us, that the dulne&s;s and heavine&s;s of mens minds, with regard to &s;piritual matters, is &s;o great, that it may ju&s;tly be compared to the want of eyes and ears, and that God has &s;o filled every thing, and every place, with mo|tives and arguments for a godly life, that they who are but &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, &s;o happy, as to u&s;e their eyes and their ears, mu&s;t needs be affected with them.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this was in a more &s;pecial manner the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;en&s;es were witne&s;&s;es of the life, miracles and doctrines of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, yet is it as truly the ca&s;e of all Chri&s;tians at this time: for the rea&s;ons of religion, and the calls to piety, are &s;o written and engraved upon every thing, and pre&s;ent them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly and &s;o con&s;tantly to all our &s;en&s;es, in every thing that we meet, that they can only be di&s;regarded by eyes that &s;ee not, and ears that hear not. What greater motive to a religious life, than the vanity and poorne&s;s of all worldly enjoy|ments? And yet who can help &s;eeing and feeling this every day of his life! What greater call to look towards God, than the pains, the &s;ickne&s;s, the cro&s;&s;es and vexations of this life! And yet who&s;e eyes and ears are not daily witne&s;&s;es of them! What miracles could more &s;trongly appeal to our &s;en&s;es, or what me&s;&s;age from heaven &s;peak louder to us, than the daily dying and departure of our fellow-creatures does. Let us but intend to &s;ee and hear, and then the whole world becomes a book of wi&s;dom and in&s;truction to us. All the mi&s;takes and di&s;appointments that happen to our&s;elves, all the mi&s;eries and errors that we &s;ee in other people, become &s;o many plain le&s;&s;ons of advice to us, teaching us with as much a&s;&s;urance as an angel from heaven, that we can no ways rai&s;e our&s;elves to any true happine&s;s, but by turning all our thoughts, our wi&s;hes and endeavours after the happine&s;s of an|other

The other day, being ju&s;t recovered from a lingering fever, he took upon him to &s;peak thus to his friends: <Q>My gla&s;s, &s;ays he, is almo&s;t run out; and your eyes &s;ee, how many marks of age and death I bear about me: But I plainly feel my&s;elf &s;inking away fa&s;ter than any &s;tanders-by imagine. I fully believe, that one year more will conclude my reckoning.</Q> The attention of his friends were much rai&s;ed by &s;uch a declaration, expecting to hear &s;omething truly ex|cellent from &s;o learned a man, who had but a year longer to live; when <HI>Octavius</HI> proceeded in this man|ner: <Q>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, &s;ays he, my friends, I have left off all taverns; the wine of tho&s;e places is not good enough for me in this decay of nature. I mu&s;t now be nice in what I drink; I can't pretend to do, as I have done, and therefore am re&s;olved to furni&s;h my own cellar with a little of the very be&s;t, though it co&s;t me ever &s;o much. I mu&s;t al&s;o tell you, my friends, that age forces a man to be wi&s;e in many other re&s;pects, and makes us change many of our opinions and practices. You know how much I have liked a large acquaintance; I now condemn it as an error. Three or four chear|ful diverting companions is all that I now de|&s;ire; becau&s;e I find that in my pre&s;ent infirmities, if I am left alone, or to grave company, I am not &s;o ea&s;y to my&s;elf.</Q> A few days after <HI>Octavius</HI> had made this declaration to his friends, he relap&s;ed into his former illne&s;s, was committed to a nur&s;e, who clo&s;ed his eyes before his fre&s;h parcel of wine came in. Young <HI>Eugenius,</HI> who was pre&s;ent at this di&s;cour&s;e, went home a new man, with full re&s;olutions of de|voting him&s;elf wholly unto God. <Q>I never, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> was &s;o deeply affected with the wi&s;dom and importance of religion, as when I &s;aw, how poorly and meanly the learned <HI>Octavius</HI> was to leave the world, thro' the want of it. How often had I
<PB N="4" REF="011654_0004_0F87C9DA20F0D898">envied his great learning, his &s;kill in languages, his knowledge of antiquity, his addre&s;s and fine manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf upon all &s;ubjects! But when I &s;aw, how poorly it all ended, what was to be the la&s;t year of &s;uch a life, and how fooli&s;hly the ma&s;ter of all the&s;e accompli&s;hments was then forced to talk, for want of being acquainted with the joys and expectations of piety; I was thoroughly con|vinced, that there was nothing to be envied or de|&s;ired, but a life of true piety; nor any thing &s;o poor and comfortle&s;s, as a death without it.</Q> Now as the young <HI>Eugenius</HI> was thus edified and in&s;tructed, &s;o, if you are &s;o happy as to have any thing of his thought|ful temper, you will find, that all the world preaches to an attentive mind; and that, if you have but ears to hear, almo&s;t every thing you meet, teaches you &s;ome le&s;&s;on of wi&s;dom. But now, if to the&s;e admonitions and in&s;tructions, which we receive from an experience of the &s;tate of human life, if to the&s;e we add the lights of religion, tho&s;e great truths which the Son of God has taught us; it will be then as much pa&s;t all doubt, that there is but one happine&s;s for man, as that there is but one God. Was all to die with our bodies, there might be &s;ome pretence for tho&s;e different &s;orts of happine&s;s that are now &s;o much talked of: But &s;ince our all be|gins at the death of our bodies; &s;ince all men are to be immortal, either in mi&s;ery or happine&s;s, in a world entirely different from this; &s;ince they are all ha&s;tening hence at all uncertainties, as fa&s;t as death can cut them down, &s;ome in &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ome in health, &s;ome &s;leeping, &s;ome waking, &s;ome at midnight, others at cock-crow|ing, and all at hours that they know not of; is it not certain, that no man can exceed another in joy and happine&s;s, but &s;o far as he exceeds in tho&s;e virtues, which fit him for a happy death.</P>
<P><HI>Serena</HI> is a lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, who&s;e time and fortune is wholly employed in what is called a genteel, fa&s;hionable way of life. Now, agreeable to the doctrine of the Go&s;pel, if <HI>Serena</HI> had been obliged by the nece&s;&s;ities of life to wa&s;h
<PB N="5" REF="011654_0005_0F87C9DB4CEF7660">cloaths for a maintenance, to wait upon &s;ome mi&s;tre&s;s, or to procure a poor living by teaching little children, it would then have been her duty to &s;erve and glorify God by &s;uch humility, obedience and faithfulne&s;s, as might adorn that &s;tate of life in which it had plea&s;ed God to place her. It would have been her duty to improve that one talent in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able; that when the time came that mankind were to be rewarded for their labours, &s;he might be received with a <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI> But as God has given her five talents, as he has placed her above the nece&s;&s;ities of life, in the happy liberty of chu&s;ing the mo&s;t exalted ways of virtue; as he has left her no|thing to do but to make the be&s;t u&s;e of variety of ble&s;&s;ings, to make the mo&s;t of a &s;hort life, in &s;tudying her own perfection, the honour of God, and the good of her neighbour, it is her bu&s;ine&s;s and duty to turn her five talents into five more, and to con&s;ider how her time and health and fortune may be made &s;o many happy means of purifying her own &s;oul, improving her fellow creatures in the ways of virtue, and car|rying her at la&s;t to the greate&s;t heigths of eternal glory. As &s;he has no mi&s;tre&s;s to &s;erve, her own &s;oul ought to be the object of her daily care; &s;he is called to mourn for its impurities and imperfections, and &s;tudy all ways and means of re&s;toring it to its pri|mitive purity. This, <HI>Serena,</HI> is your indi&s;pen&s;ible duty; for as &s;ure as God is one God, &s;o &s;ure it is, that he has but one command to all mankind, whether they be bound or free, rich or poor; and that is, to act up to the excellency of that nature which he has given them, to live by rea&s;on, to walk in the light of religion, to glorify God in all his gifts, and dedicate every &s;tate and condition of life to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Let us look now at a &s;tate of life, which draws the admiration and envy of far the greater part of the world, <HI>viz.</HI> the condition of tho&s;e who have ama&s;&s;ed great riches; a &s;ituation which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour de|clares to be extremely dangerous, <HI>Luke</HI> 18:24. <HI>How
<PB N="6" REF="011654_0006_0F87C9DB9DF3C920">hardly &s;hall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of heaven!</HI> And again, <HI>Luke</HI> 6:24. <HI>Wo to you rich; for ye have received your con&s;olation.</HI> And yet a &s;itua|tion which multitudes are pre&s;&s;ing after, many even without &s;eeming to propo&s;e any other u&s;e from their riches, than the bare plea&s;ure of ama&s;&s;ing and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing them. <HI>Negotius</HI> is a temperate hone&s;t man. He &s;erved his time under a ma&s;ter of great trade, but has by his own management made it a more con|&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s than ever it was before. The ge|neral good of trade &s;eems to <HI>Negotius</HI> to be the general good of life. As money is continually pouring in upon him, &s;o he often lets it go in various kinds of expence and genero&s;ity, and &s;ometimes in ways of charity. If you a&s;k what it is that has &s;ecured <HI>Ne|gotius</HI> from all &s;candalous vices, it is the &s;ame thing that has kept him from all &s;trictne&s;s of devotion, it is his great bu&s;ine&s;s. He has always had too many im|portant things in his head, his thoughts have been too much employed, to &s;uffer him to fall either into any cour&s;e of rakery, or to feel the nece&s;&s;ity of an inward &s;olid piety. If <HI>Negotius</HI> was a&s;ked, what it is he drives at in life, he would be at a lo&s;s for an an|&s;wer. He has &s;everal confu&s;ed notions in his head, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is &s;omething great to have more bu&s;ine&s;s than other people, to grow continually richer and richer, and to rai&s;e an immen&s;e fortune before he dies. The generality of people, when they think of happine&s;s, think upon <HI>Negotius,</HI> in who&s;e life every in&s;tance of happine&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to meet. Let us now look at this condition in another, but truer light. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Negotius</HI> was a painful labo|rious man, every day deep in variety of affairs; that he was &s;ober and regular in his bu&s;ine&s;s; that he grew old in this cour&s;e of trading, and that the end and de&s;ign of all this labour was only this, that he may die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than an hundred thou&s;and pair of boots and &s;purs. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;ober part of the world &s;ay of him, when he is dead, that he was a great and happy man, a thorough
<PB N="7" REF="011654_0007_0F87C9E09AEF7260">ma&s;ter of bu&s;ine&s;s, and had acquired an hundred thou&s;and pair of boots and &s;purs, when he died. Now if this was really the ca&s;e, I believe it would be rea|dily granted, that a life of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s was as poor and ridiculous as any that can be invented. But it would puzzle any one to &s;hew, that a man that has &s;pent all his time and thoughts in bu&s;ine&s;s and hurry, that he might die, as it is &s;aid, worth an hundred thou&s;and pounds, has done more good for him&s;elf, than he who has taken the &s;ame pains to have as many of any thing el&s;e, when he leaves the world. For if the temper and &s;tate of our &s;ouls be our whole &s;tate; if the only end of life be to die as free from &s;in, and exalted in virtue, as we can; if naked as we came, &s;o naked we are to return, and to &s;tand a trial before Chri&s;t and his holy angels, for everla&s;ting happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, what can it po&s;&s;ibly &s;ignify what a man had or had not, in this world? What can it &s;ignify, what you call tho&s;e things, which a man has left be|hind him; whether you call them his, or any one's el&s;e; whether you call them trees or fields, or birds or feathers; whether you call them an hundred thou|&s;and pounds, or an hundred thou&s;and pair of boots. I &s;ay, call them; for the things &s;ignify no more to him than the names. Now as it is ea&s;y to &s;ee the folly of a life thus &s;pent, there needs no better faculty of &s;eeing, no finer under&s;tanding, to &s;ee the folly of a life &s;pent in making a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of ten towns be|fore he dies; for if, when he has got all his towns or all his boots, his &s;oul is to go to his own place among &s;eparate &s;pirits, and his body to be laid by in a coffin, till the la&s;t trumpet calls him to judgment; where the inquiry will be, how humbly, how de|voutly, how purely, how meekly and charitably we have &s;poke, thought and acted, whil&s;t we were in the body; how can we &s;ay, that he who has wore out his life in rai&s;ing an hundred thou&s;and pounds, has acted wi&s;er for him&s;elf, than he who has had the &s;ame care to procure an hundred thou&s;and of any thing el&s;e. But farther: Let it now be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Negotius,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="011654_0008_0F87C9E12602FCD0">when he fir&s;t entered into bu&s;ine&s;s, happening to read the go&s;pel with attention and eyes opened, found that he had a much greater bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands, than that to which he had &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip; that there were things which belong to man, of much more importance than all that our eyes can &s;ee; &s;o glorious as to de&s;erve all our thoughts, &s;o dangerous as to need all our care, and &s;o certain as never to de|ceive the faithful labourer. If <HI>Negotius,</HI> believing the&s;e things to be true, had entirely devoted him&s;elf to God at his fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, re&s;olving to pur&s;ue his bu&s;ine&s;s no farther than was con&s;i&s;tent with great devotion, humility and &s;elf-denial; and for no other ends, but to provide him&s;elf with a &s;ober &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and to do all the good that he could to the &s;ouls and bodies of his fellow-creatures. Now, had this been the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit of <HI>Negotius,</HI> can any one who is truly in his &s;en&s;es, &s;ay he had lo&s;t any degree of true joy and happine&s;s, by thus conforming to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity: And yet I doubt not, but worldly Chri&s;tians of every denomination will oppo&s;e, and endeavour to di&s;credit &s;uch a repre&s;entation of Chri&s;tianity; but when you repre&s;ent to your mind, how Chri&s;tians ought to live unto God, and in what degree of wi&s;dom and holine&s;s they ought to u&s;e the things of this life, you mu&s;t not look at the world, which lies in wickedne&s;s, and who&s;e wi&s;dom is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God; but you mu&s;t look towards heaven. You mu&s;t with the eyes of faith penetrate into the invi&s;ible world, the world of &s;pirits, and con|&s;ider your order and condition among them; you mu&s;t endeavour, by the help of grace, to put in practice the highe&s;t precepts of the go&s;pel; you mu&s;t think, how departed &s;ouls would live, if they were again to act the &s;hort part of human life, and what de|gree of wi&s;dom and holine&s;s you will wi&s;h for, when you are leaving this world. Now, this is not pro|po&s;ing to our&s;elves any needle&s;s perfection; it is but barely complying with the precepts of the go&s;pel, which requires, that we <HI>be holy in all manner of con|ver&s;ation.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="011654_0009_0F87C9E1A1B79398">And as the holine&s;s of Chri&s;tianity con&s;e|crates all e&s;tates and employments of life unto God, &s;o are we more e&s;pecially obliged to ob&s;erve this re|ligious exactne&s;s in the u&s;e of our e&s;tates and for|tunes, becau&s;e, if we wa&s;te them, we don't wa&s;te a trifle, that &s;ignifies little; but we wa&s;te that, which might be made as eyes to the blind, as a hu&s;band to the widow, and as a father to the orphan. If a man had eyes, hands and feet, that he could give to tho&s;e that wanted them; if he &s;hould either lock them up in a che&s;t, or plea&s;e him&s;elf with &s;ome needle&s;s and ridiculous u&s;e of them, in&s;tead of giving them to his brethren that were blind and lame; &s;hould we not ju&s;tly reckon him an inhuman wretch, if he &s;hould rather chu&s;e to amu&s;e him&s;elf with furni&s;hing his hou&s;e with tho&s;e things, than to entitle him&s;elf to an eternal reward, by giving them to tho&s;e that wanted eyes and hands; might we not ju&s;tly reckon him mad? for after we have &s;atisfied our own &s;ober and rea&s;on|able wants, all the re&s;t of our money is like &s;pare eyes and hands; &s;omething that can only be well u&s;ed, by giving it to tho&s;e that want it. The&s;e tempers and this u&s;e of our worldly goods, is &s;o much the doctrine of all the New Te&s;tament, that you can't read a chapter without being taught of it, particularly that remarkable pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Matth.</HI> 25:31, 46.</P>
<P>The life of the pious lady <HI>Elizabeth Ha&s;tings</HI> is an extraordinary in&s;tance of the happy effect which Christianity has upon tho&s;e who by joining with the calls of grace, become willing to give up their whole hearts to follow its dictates. This pious lady's fir&s;t principle appears to have been the Glory of God, and the purity of her own heart; next to this a continual &s;olicitude and labour to hold all her capacities, all her power and all her fortunes continually upon &s;tretch for the good of all men, weeping with tho&s;e that wept; rejoicing with tho&s;e that rejoiced; given to ho&s;pitality; di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;aints, and to tho&s;e that were le&s;s &s;o, having joy at the con|ver&s;ion of a &s;inner, or the lea&s;t appearance of it; but
<PB N="10" REF="011654_0010_0F87C9E261D44740">the care of all her cares was the &s;tranger, the father|le&s;s and the widow, the needy, and he that hath no helper, the lame, the halt and the blind. And in this place, &s;ays the author of her life, what &s;hall I &s;ay! or how can I expect to be believed! The bent of her &s;pirit ever lay towards the&s;e: She had a &s;hare in all their &s;ufferings; &s;he would often conver&s;e with them, and enquire into their hi&s;tory, with as much poverty of &s;pirit, as they were in of outward con|dition; &s;he would &s;tudy their particular ca&s;es, and put them in the way of better welfare. Some of the&s;e were ever in her hou&s;e, and frequently in great num|bers; and it was no neglect of her's, if any one went away unrelieved with meat, phy&s;ic, raiment or mo|ney; many of the&s;e that lived remote, had yearly allowances, and large &s;ums frequently i&s;&s;ued out into di&s;tant parts of the kingdom. Her &s;till larger appli|cations were fixed pen&s;ions upon reduced families, the maintenance of her own charity-&s;chool, contributions to others, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was a great mi&s;tre&s;s of all parts of oeconomy, with re&s;pect to what &s;he laid out upon her&s;elf. Her body, &s;he knew, was the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, which the believer mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;anctification and honour, wherefore her &s;upport of it in meat, drink and &s;leep was ever bounded by nece&s;&s;ity; for they that walk in the Spirit, as this pious lady did, die progre&s;&s;ively to every vanity, and dare not indulge the hurtful gratifications of the fle&s;h, but labour to keep it under, as knowing it to be the &s;eat and repo&s;itory of their mo&s;t dangerous and deadly enemy. Neverthele&s;s &s;he &s;ought not her &s;alvation by the force of her alms, highly affluent as they were; for the&s;e, though nece&s;&s;ary duties, yet, &s;he well knew, were not the charity of the go&s;pel; not that charity which the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;o divinely de&s;cribes at 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 13:3. She was &s;en&s;ible, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t be revealed in the heart, before we can have any ju&s;t claim to di&s;ciple&s;hip, and that it is his ruling and bringing all things there in &s;ubjection to his Spirit that was the great and only principle of Chri&s;tian
<PB N="11" REF="011654_0011_0F87C9E478433A90">charity. She knew, that the great &s;cene of religion lay within, in the right government of the heart; ac|cordingly her eye was ever upon her heart, to &s;ee that all its principles were clean&s;ed from evil mixtures, had no taint from &s;elf-love, were not &s;ullied with vain-glory; her care was to ob&s;erve the tendency of all its motions, how its &s;truggles weakened in &s;inful de&s;ires, endeavouring continually to nouri&s;h it by acts of faith and in the blood of her Redeemer. She had well learnt to overcome evil with good, to &s;uffer long and be kind, to bear all things, and if ever by &s;peech, carriage or otherwi&s;e &s;he &s;u&s;pected, that &s;he had di&s;turbed the &s;pirit of any, &s;he had no peace with her&s;elf till &s;he had taken care for the recovery of theirs.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid of the endowments and virtues of this true di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, more e&s;pecially of her patience under &s;ufferings, and re|&s;ignation to Divine will; under the painful di&s;pen&s;a|tion &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through, during the la&s;t eighteen months of her life, occa&s;ioned by a cancer in her brea&s;t, which, notwith&s;tanding &s;he &s;uffered it to be &s;eparated from her body, yet in the end occa&s;ioned her death. This painful operation &s;he not only bore with patience, but even rejoiced, that &s;he was counted worthy to &s;uffer, knowing her Saviour had &s;uffered in his fle&s;h, and that, as &s;ufferings was the way to his perfection, it mu&s;t al&s;o be the way to ours, this being the declared condition of our being glorified with him; the true&s;t marks of adoption, and the mo&s;t &s;overeign medicine &s;ent from heaven for our cure. The&s;e truths this truly pious Lady was &s;o well acquainted with, that &s;he declared, <HI>She would not wi&s;h to be out of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, nor exchange it for any other at any price.</HI> Thus with great meekne&s;s and tranquil|lity, with chearfulne&s;s &s;carce to be believed, in per|fect &s;erenity and freedom, &s;he continued her u&s;ual life till the time appointed for the operation. When that time of deep trial came, &s;he &s;hewed no reluctance or &s;truggle, but endured all even without complaint;
<PB N="12" REF="011654_0012_0F87C9E4A082C8D0">only towards the end &s;he drew &s;uch a &s;igh, as the compa&s;&s;ionate reader who reads this, may do. Hence it appears, how tho&s;e that follow the Lamb with &s;in|cerity, are endowed with virtue and power re&s;ulting from the true &s;pirit of his religion, which others are unacquainted with. The night following the opera|tion was not indeed a night of much &s;leep, but of truly cele&s;tial re&s;t; a night of thank&s;giving to her God for the vi&s;ible demon&s;tration of his power in her and about her, for his &s;tretch'd-out arm in her great de|liverance, for the bountiful provi&s;ion her had made for her body and &s;oul, holding all the powers of her &s;pirit exerci&s;ed in acts of love, gratitude and adora|tion. She &s;ooner than was expected got upon her feet, and, with every improvement that could be made, into the &s;ame way of life that &s;he had been in before, wholly intent upon the glory of God, and the good of her fellow-creatures. But the di&s;temper, only repre&s;&s;ed for a time, ro&s;e upon with great malig|nity, to the much greater affliction of numbers in the world, than of her that bore it; for &s;he had now been, for &s;ome time, in the &s;chool of affliction, exerci&s;ed with its &s;harp di&s;cipline, and found its &s;alutary effects. Under the&s;e &s;entiments her hope was full of immor|tality, and the eternal weight of glory, now in full view, made all her afflictions light. In this near and certain approach of death, her cheri&s;hing warmth, like that of the &s;un, though it might be mo&s;t felt by tho&s;e neare&s;t, yet al&s;o reached tho&s;e at greater di&s;|tance; witne&s;s the great numbers of letters &s;he writ, and dictated to others when &s;he became unable to write, full of &s;weet coun&s;el, having for their argu|ment the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of piety; pre&s;&s;ing home the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of it, and &s;etting forth its true nature; wit|ne&s;s al&s;o the number of per&s;ons of all conditions who re&s;orted at her hou&s;e, to behold the living power of religion in her, and to be benefited by her wi&s;dom. With &s;ome of the&s;e &s;he continued in heavenly confe|rence as long as &s;he had &s;trength. Her life was near drawing to its la&s;t &s;tage; but her lamp and her life

<HEAD><HI>A Chri&s;tian's daily Conver&s;ation with</HI> GOD, Exemplified in a &s;hort Extract OF THE Holy Life of ARMELLE NICOLAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;on, who&s;e daily conver&s;ation is here de&s;cribed, was not long &s;ince a poor &s;imple country maid, and &s;ervant to a great family in <HI>France.</HI> The whole cour&s;e of her life was very in&s;tructive, and a mo&s;t &s;hining pattern of a true &s;piritual conver|&s;ation.
<PB N="14" REF="011654_0014_0F87C9E639606E48">'Tis remarkable, that this per&s;on who &s;erved God with &s;uch unwearied prayer and watchfulne&s;s, was &s;o ignorant, that &s;he could neither read nor write, and was in the &s;tation of a &s;ervant, con&s;tantly employed in bu&s;ine&s;s and hard labour. Hence we &s;ee, that the true &s;ervice of God is &s;piritual, univer&s;al, plain and ea&s;y, &s;o that no per&s;on can be excu&s;ed from it by any pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>'Tis not &s;o much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, or of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and heart, that will render our &s;ervice acceptable to God. Hence the &s;cripture declaring, what &s;ort of change is to be wrought in a &s;oul, requires a tran&s;lation from darkne&s;s to light, (<HI>Acts</HI> 26:18.) from death to life, (<HI>Eph.</HI> 2:5.) and from being lo&s;t to be found again.</P>
<P>The Lord give his grace to all that heartily de&s;ire it, always to walk before him after &s;uch a pious man|ner as this devout &s;oul did! whereof &s;he her&s;elf gave the following account to the author of her life.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I wake in the morning, I throw my&s;elf into the arms of my heavenly love, as a child into the arms of his father. I ri&s;e with a de&s;ign to &s;erve and plea&s;e him, and if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy pre&s;ence, and &s;peak to him as if I really &s;aw him with my bodily eyes. I give my|&s;elf up wholly to him, and de&s;ire him to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not &s;uffer me that day to do the lea&s;t thing which might be offen&s;ive to him. In &s;hort, I love and prai&s;e him as much and as long as my affairs permit; though very often I have hardly &s;o much time as to &s;ay the Lord's prayer. But I do not trouble my&s;elf about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my bu&s;ine&s;s, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpo&s;e to pray to him. This he him&s;elf has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</P>
<P>I dre&s;s my&s;elf in his pre&s;ence, and he &s;hews me that his love &s;upplies me with raiment. And when
<PB N="15" REF="011654_0015_0F87C9E6DAA37D10">I go about my bu&s;ine&s;s, even then doth he not for|&s;ake me, nor I him, but he conver&s;es with me; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, &s;et apart on purpo&s;e for my &s;piritual re|collection. O! how &s;weet and ea&s;y is all labour and toil in &s;uch good company! Sometimes I perceive &s;uch &s;trength and &s;upport in my mind, that nothing is to hard for me. Nothing but the body is at work, the heart and my&s;elf burn with love to God.</P>
<P>When the body begins to be weary, or to repine, or to de&s;ire un&s;ea&s;onable re&s;t, being oppre&s;&s;ed with unea&s;ine&s;s; my divine love enlightens me forthwith, and &s;hews me how I ought to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e rebellious motions of corrupt nature, and not to nouri&s;h them at all, either by word or deed. This love keeps the door of my lips, and watches over my heart, that it may not in the lea&s;t contribute to &s;uch irregular pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But if, at any time, for want of care, I am &s;ur|pri&s;ed with the&s;e or the like faults, I cannot be at re&s;t till I have obtained pardon, and God be recon|ciled to me. I lie pro&s;trate before his foot-&s;tool, con|fe&s;&s;ing all my faults to him, and there I continue till he has forgiven me, renewed his friend&s;hip with me, and confirmed it more than before. If people per&s;e|cute me, and by foul and uncharitable cen&s;ures rai&s;e &s;candals upon me, or any other way afflict me; or if evil &s;pirits attack me with their crafty and cunning temptations, I then pre&s;ently run to my heavenly Love, who readily &s;tretches forth his &s;acred arms to receive me, &s;hewing me his heart and wounds open for my &s;ecurity, in which I hide my&s;elf as in a &s;trong ca&s;tle and fortre&s;s. And then I am &s;o mightily &s;trengthned, that if the whole army of hell it&s;elf, together with all the creatures, &s;hould ri&s;e up again&s;t me, I fear them not, becau&s;e I am under the protection of the mo&s;t high God, his love being the hiding-place and &s;afe|guard of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would go away from me, I tell him, O! 'tis no
<PB N="16" REF="011654_0016_0F87C9EC2E3A9C28">matter, my Love, conceal thy&s;elf as much as thou plea&s;e&s;t, neverthele&s;s I'll &s;erve thee; for I know thou art my God. And then I &s;tand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing my Love. And at the &s;ame time perceiving the great|ne&s;s of my mi&s;ery and poverty, I in&s;i&s;t the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and re&s;olve to re&s;t con|tented, tho' it &s;hould plea&s;e him to leave me all the days of my life in &s;uch a condition. But he never lets me continue long under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and if I may venture &s;o to &s;peak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</P>
<P>If I am per&s;uaded on holidays to be merry in com|pany, I excu&s;e my&s;elf. For nothing can be compared to the plea&s;ures of my Love, which are &s;o much the &s;weeter and greater for my withdrawing from all com|pany what&s;oever. If people wonder, how I can &s;tay always at home alone, I think within my&s;elf: O! if you knew the glorious company I have, you would not &s;ay that I was alone; for I am never le&s;s alone, than when I have nobody with me.</P>
<P>The night coming on, and every one going to re&s;t, I find re&s;t only in the arms of divine love: I &s;leep leaning on his holy brea&s;t, like a child in his mother's bo&s;om. I &s;ay, I go to &s;leep, but being &s;till bu&s;ied about the love and prai&s;es of my God, till I fall quite a&s;leep. Many times this love rou&s;es up all my &s;en&s;es, &s;o that I cannot &s;leep the greate&s;t part of the night, but I &s;pend it in the embraces of the grace of God, which never for&s;akes &s;uch a poor mi&s;erable creature as I am, but pre&s;erves me, and takes &s;pecial care of me.</P>
<P>If in the night the evil &s;pirits hover about, to tor|ment or to &s;urpri&s;e me, (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, it gives me grace too, to re&s;i&s;t them courageou&s;ly, as if I were awake. For they &s;eldom continue long to a&s;|&s;ault me, unle&s;s it be in my &s;leep.</P>
<P>And this is the life I have led for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, without perceiving the lea&s;t change of that
<PB N="17" REF="011654_0017_0F87C9EE31ACB0A8">love which was poured out into my heart, after my &s;incere conver&s;ion unto him. Nay, I have ob&s;erved its daily increa&s;e, tho' every day it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to endure any addition to what I already enjoy. But truly, it is an infinite love, which &s;atisfies and nouri&s;hes me, &s;o that every day I have a new hunger, tho' methinks I can receive no more, than what I po&s;&s;e&s;s already every moment.</P>
<P>THE author of her life &s;ays, concerning the man|ner of her expre&s;&s;ions, that they were always very mode&s;t, without any noi&s;e or vehemence: her com|mon di&s;cour&s;es were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly mis-&s;pend their time in u&s;ele&s;s conver&s;ation and unprofitable talk.</P>
<P>For a long while &s;he could bear no other di&s;cour&s;e but of God and his holy love. <HI>I cannot imagine,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>how a &s;oul, created for heaven, can be concerned about the dro&s;s of this world.</HI> From that time, if &s;he happened to be in company, where the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e was but indifferent, either &s;he did not mind it at all, entertaining her&s;elf in the mean while with God; or, as &s;oon as &s;he thought it proper, &s;he diverted and changed the di&s;cour&s;e; thinking it but lo&s;t time, which was &s;pent in this trifles of this world.</P>
<P>To every body that had a mind to be acquainted with God Almighty, &s;he gave this advice: To be &s;ilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this (&s;aid &s;he) is the be|ginning of our union with God, and by the&s;e means the &s;oul forgets earthly things, and rai&s;es her&s;elf up to the contemplation of heavenly objects. We ought to lo&s;e our familiarity with the creatures, if we de&s;ire to enjoy the conver&s;ation of the Creator, a moment of which doth afford more delight and &s;atisfaction, than all the fine&s;t di&s;cour&s;es in the world.</P>
<P>The real experience &s;he had of the inward and &s;pi|ritual life of grace, and of the manifold operations it was attended with, doth abundantly appear from the larger account of her life and conver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="011654_0018_0F87C9EEE10308D8">
One time when her mi&s;tre&s;s was afraid that <HI>Armelle</HI> was like to run quite mad by an exce&s;s of devotion, &s;he forbad her all &s;piritual exerci&s;es, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: <HI>Armelle,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the fal&s;e &s;tep her mi&s;tre&s;s took, &s;miled within her&s;elf, &s;aying, Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my Beloved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time, when I was &s;eeking only God without me, and then I was mad indeed. This mi&s;tre&s;s of hers being of a &s;our and moro&s;e humour, &s;hewed a deal of ill-nature to <HI>Armelle,</HI> of which, however, &s;he never complained, but rather thanked God, that he was plea&s;ed to make this a means of her fuller purification. Some &s;eeing what &s;he &s;uffered in hat hou&s;e, advi&s;ed her entirely to quit that place; &s;he replied, according to her u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s: Why would you have me flee from the cro&s;s which the Lord him&s;elf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I &s;hall never do it, except they turn me away by force. In which unexpected an|&s;wer her friends entirely acquie&s;ced, never prompting her again to quit a place where &s;he had daily oppor|tunity to practi&s;e patience and &s;elf-denial; virtues &s;o much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for rightly framing a Chri&s;tian life and conver&s;ation. At another time &s;he &s;aid: If the &s;oul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the in&s;ults of the devil, and of the creatures, are borne with joy and comfort. But this is mi&s;ery indeed, when the Lord him&s;elf withdraws from the &s;oul, and lets her &s;hift for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In what company &s;oever &s;he was, &s;he talked of nothing more, than of being <HI>faithful to God.</HI> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than, <HI>Let us be faith|ful, let us be faithful to the Lord.</HI> This word &s;he thought fit for any time, and &s;uitable to every com|pany. Being a&s;ked by her friends, whether &s;he had nothing el&s;e to &s;ay, &s;he an&s;wered: Don't wonder at my &s;aying this over and over again. If I &s;hould
<PB N="19" REF="011654_0019_0F87C9EF24274B78">live a thou&s;and years, I &s;hould &s;till tell you the &s;ame thing. For 'tis faithfulne&s;s, wherein the perfection of a Chri&s;tian life con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Of the con&s;training power of the divine love &s;he has the following expre&s;&s;ion: Whenever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations, (apt to &s;teal in upon the mind under the &s;pecious pre|tence of nece&s;&s;ity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This divine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imaginable for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this rea&s;on keeps his eye con&s;tantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never &s;o &s;mall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me clo&s;ely confined to an holy awe and warine&s;s; and when I happened by one over&s;ight or other to withdraw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment pur|&s;ued after me, and recalled me to my duty. But all this was done with &s;o much love and tenderne&s;s, that it mu&s;t be a heart of bra&s;s, if not mollified by &s;uch endearing marks of love and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>She often wondered at &s;ome peoples dilatory doings in the &s;ervice of God, and &s;aid, it was a cunning fetch and &s;tratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another &s;uch de&s;igns as might &s;erve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures. <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>it often hap|pens, that that grace which at one hour offers it&s;elf to a man, in order to &s;upport him under &s;ome difficult enter|pri&s;es, is not &s;o ea&s;ily met with at another time.</HI> And be|&s;ides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were &s;ure to live longer, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to an|other what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the &s;ervice of God, mu&s;t needs have but little love at the bottom. <HI>Wherever love is rai&s;ed to any eon&s;iderable degree, there the &s;oul can't re&s;t, whil&s;t there remains any thing to be done required by the beloved.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="011654_0020_0F87C9EFE0FF6B10">And this dilatory temper, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> was a great in pe|diment in the way to perfection. Many &s;ouls were convinced of the will of God, but being too back|ward con&s;tantly to &s;truggle again&s;t the corrupt pro|pen&s;ities of their dull and lazy temper, they made but a &s;low progre&s;s in the work of religion. They &s;ay, to-morrow, to-morrow it &s;hall be done in good earne&s;t; but that to-morrow never comes. The con&s;equence whereof is, that the longer they flatter them&s;elves in their di&s;orderly and wonted cu&s;toms, the le&s;s able they are to re&s;i&s;t them at la&s;t at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, &s;ince they did not improve faithfully what once they had re|ceived.</P>
<P>Her humility was al&s;o grounded on a true and &s;olid foundation. She confe&s;&s;es, that the infinite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride. I was a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;ays &s;he, when I was told to watch again&s;t pride, for I thought whil&s;t I was well in my wits, I could not po&s;&s;ibly be proud. I was &s;o fully convinced that every thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offered to per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters"> me to the contrary, I &s;hould never have be|lieved them. And this &s;en&s;e fortified me again&s;t every kind of pride.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e her love to God was &s;o great and fervent, the love &s;he bore to her fellow-creatures was al&s;o won|derfully influenced and inflamed thereby. When &s;he con&s;idered the woful &s;tate of the wicked, and the dreadful judgment that is like to befal them at la&s;t, &s;he then felt a more tender and commi&s;erating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compa&s;&s;ion. When &s;he looked upon the happy &s;tate &s;he was ar|rived to, and the &s;evere doom attending &s;uch pro|fligate wretches, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;he &s;eemed unto her&s;elf like one that had been in a great &s;torm at &s;ea, and by &s;tre&s;s of weather like to be ca&s;t away every minute; but getting off at la&s;t &s;afe and &s;ound, re|membered now a&s;hore the dangers his brethren and near relations were &s;till expo&s;ed to, being to&s;&s;ed up
<PB N="21" REF="011654_0021_0F87C9F09EC3D6D8">and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! &s;aid &s;he, thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the danger &s;inners run them&s;elves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me, the more fervent is my de&s;ire, that al&s;o others might partake of the &s;ame with me.</P>
<P>AND now, ye learned men, and refined wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and &s;implicity of this poor country-maid! Con&s;ider how far &s;he exceeds your high flown &s;uperficial wi&s;dom, and the dark fla&s;hes of human wit and learning? And was it po&s;&s;ible for her to attain to this <HI>heavenly wi&s;dom and divine knowledge,</HI> to &s;uch a noblene&s;s and elevation of mind, without the &s;craps and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of artificial learning and philo&s;ophy? then truly there mu&s;t be another &s;chool wherein tho&s;e that <HI>flow unto the Lord,</HI> (P&s;. 34:5) <HI>are lighted.</HI> Indeed <HI>to know the love of Chri&s;t, pa&s;&s;eth all knowledge,</HI> Eph. 3:19. Con|cerning which our Saviour was plea&s;ed thus to expre&s;s his grateful &s;entiments with hearty joy and heavenly triumph: <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes. Even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight,</HI> Matth. 11:25, 26. <HI>For it is written,</HI> (&s;ays St. Paul) <HI>I will de&s;troy the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and will bring to nothing the un|der&s;tanding of the prudent?

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON Impartiality and Go&s;pel Love, Recommended to the Notice OF THE Truly Pious of every Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;piration of God and the clear infor|mation of the holy &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, that God re&s;erves his choice&s;t &s;ecrets for the pure&s;t minds, and that true holine&s;s is the only &s;afe entrance into divine knowledge. The apo&s;tle declares, <HI>Acts</HI> 10:34, <HI>That he perceived of a truth, that God is no re|&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him.</HI> Yet, notwith&s;tanding the clearne&s;s of this and many more &s;uch doctrines contained in the &s;cripture, &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s and partiality, tho&s;e inhuman and ba&s;e qua|lities, are &s;uffered to prevail even among&s;t &s;uch as are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t pious in the &s;everal divi&s;ions of the Chri&s;tian church, &s;o as to rai&s;e a flight, and often a kind of enmity, again&s;t tho&s;e of other com|munions. Neverthele&s;s, the truly pious-hearted of every party are indeed nearer to one another than many of them apprehend; and it would on ex|perience be found, that if each particular divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity could produce but one man a piece, that had the piety of an apo&s;tle, and the impartial love of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, they would not want half a &s;heet of paper to hold the articles of union, nor be half an hour before they were of one religion, however they may differ in &s;ome external practices. If we &s;ought truth for its own &s;ake; if we loved our neighbour as our&s;elves; and, if we de&s;ired nothing by our religion, but to be accept|able
<PB N="23" REF="011654_0023_0F87C9F21BB2C648">to God, this partial &s;pirit would have no place with us. That univer&s;al love, which gives the whole &s;trength of the heart to God, and makes us love every man as we love our&s;elves, is the noble&s;t, the mo&s;t divine and Godlike &s;tate of the &s;oul; and religion does people very little good, but &s;o far as it brings this perfect love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure, di&s;intere&s;t|ed love of God and our neighbour. There is there|fore a communion of &s;aints in the love of God, which no one can learn from that which is called orthodoxy in the different &s;ects, but is only to be had by a total dying to all worldly views, by a pure love of God, and by &s;uch an unction from above, as delivers the mind from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and makes it love truth and goodne&s;s with an equality of affection in every man, let his name and pro|fe&s;&s;ion to religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in heart and &s;pirit with all that is holy and good in all profe&s;&s;ions, we enter into the true com|munion of &s;aints, and become real members of the true univer&s;al Chri&s;tian church. It is thus, that the angels, as mini&s;tring &s;pirits, a&s;&s;i&s;t, join, unite and co-operate with every thing that is holy and good in every divi&s;ion of mankind. He that has been all his life long u&s;ed to look with great &s;light upon tho&s;e of other profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t naturally ex|pect, they will be treated by God, as they have been by him; and if he had the keys of the king|dom of heaven, &s;uch people would find it hard to get a place in it. But it &s;tands us greatly in hand to get rid of this temper before we die; for if no|thing but univer&s;al love can enter into the kingdom of God, what can be more nece&s;&s;ary for us, than to be full of this love before we die?</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes hear people of great zeal declare on their deathbeds their &s;trict attachment to the par|ticular profe&s;&s;ion to which they belong, and de|claring their di&s;unity with all other churches; but
<PB N="24" REF="011654_0024_0F87C9F9296AC498">how much better would it be, if &s;uch a per&s;on was to &s;ay: In this divided &s;tate of Chri&s;tendom, I have cho&s;en to live and die in outward communion with the &s;ociety to which I am joined; fully believing, that if I wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit and in truth in this divided part of the church, I &s;hall be as acceptable to him, as if I had been a faithful member of the one whole church, before it was broken into &s;eparate parts. But as I am now going out of this di&s;ordered divi|&s;ion, into a more univer&s;al &s;tate of things, as I am going to the God of all churches, to a king|dom of univer&s;al love, which mu&s;t have its inha|bitants from all people, nations and languages of the earth; &s;o in this &s;pirit of univer&s;al love, I de|&s;ire to perform my la&s;t act of communion, join|ing in heart and &s;pirit with all that is Chri&s;tian, holy and good in all other churches; praying from the bottom of my &s;oul, that every church may have its &s;aints; that God's kingdom may come, his will be done in every divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tians and men, and that every thing that hath breath, may prai&s;e the Lord!</P>
