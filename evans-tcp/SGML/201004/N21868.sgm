<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO pre&s;ent, at one view, a &s;eries of the mo&s;t remarkable events, tran&s;actions, and acci|dents which have occurred in ancient and modern times, and to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the names and atchievements of great men, particularly of tho&s;e by who&s;e exertions, under Divine Providence, the United States enjoy their pre&s;ent happy form of government, has been the principal de&s;ign con|templated in the pre&s;ent publication.</P>
<P>Through the whole of the following pages, the editor has &s;elected his articles from hi&s;torians of the fir&s;t rank, and from the mo&s;t authentic An|nali&s;ts; hence he hopes, that his performance will be found u&s;eful to every cla&s;s of readers&mdash;To the &s;tudent it may frequently &s;ave the trouble of turn|ing over a number of volumes to refre&s;h his me|mory; and to tho&s;e who&s;e lei&s;ure cannot admit of the peru&s;al of many books, it may contain both entertainment and in&s;truction. It will al&s;o be a remembrance to tho&s;e who have forgotten what they have read, and may &s;erve as an epitome of univer&s;al hi&s;tory, particularly of that part which re&s;pects America.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="028800_0005_0FDD4ABC846DC618">To obviate the confu&s;ion which would be oc|ca&s;ioned by blending all tran&s;actions, &amp;c. toge|ther, the editor has cla&s;&s;ed the different &s;ubjects under &s;eparate heads, each ranged in alphabetical order, which mode of arrangement he hopes will, in various re&s;pects, be found more convenient than the other.</P>
<P>Through every part of the work, the editor can with confidence a&s;&s;ert, that he has anxiou&s;ly endeavoured to render the information contained as intere&s;ting and accurate as po&s;&s;ible. Where he has &s;ailed in either of the&s;e re&s;pects, which he hopes has been &s;eldom the ca&s;e, he &s;olicits the indulgence of a candid public.</P>

When the king retired, he was followed by the nobility and a part of the clergy; but the deputies of the com|mons remained on the benches, and declared "that they were there by the voice of the people, and that nothing &s;hould expel them but the power of the bayonet."

The Goths and Vandals over|turned the Roman power 409, and continued in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, till it was conquered by the Moors in 711. Spain had, hitherto, contained a number of &s;mall king|doms, all of which were &s;wallowed up in Ca&s;tille and Arragon 1492, and in 1497, the&s;e two were united by the Queen of Spain, having married the king of Arragon, who then a&s;&s;umed the title of Catholic maje&s;ty.

Their mountainous, uninviting &s;ituation formed a better &s;ecu|rity for their liberties, than their forts or armies, hence their &s;ubjection to Burgundy and Germany, was no|minal, rather than real, till about the year 1300, when the Emperor Albert I. treated them with &s;o much rigour, that they petitioned him again&s;t the cruelty of his governors.

<P>United States of America. At the conclu&s;ion of the war in 1763, between Britain and France, the Briti&s;h colonies of North America, were in a &s;tate of high po|litical

pro&s;perity. Their population, commerce and wealth advanced with a rapid pace. Their internal go|vernment was conducted with a degree of &s;teadine&s;s, frugadity and wi&s;dom, which have been &s;eldom, or, perhaps never equalled. But the war was &s;carcely fini&s;hed, when Britain attempted to reduce the&s;e colo|nies to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t unconditional &s;ervitude. In March 1764, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed in the Briti&s;h parliament, by which heavy duties were laid on commodities im|ported, by the coloni&s;ts, from &s;uch We&s;t India I&s;lands, as did not belong to Britan, and another bill was &s;oon &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed, to re&s;train the currency of paper money. The con&s;tant plea of the Americans, during the whole cour&s;e of the controver&s;y, re&s;ted upon this doctrine, that <HI>taxation without repre&s;entation,</HI> was but another name for &s;lavery. Their complaints were loud; but the Briti&s;h parliament was &s;o far from redre&s;&s;ing their grievances, that on March 22, 1765, the &s;tamp act followed. The pretended rea&s;on of the&s;e taxations was, that a &s;um might be produced, &s;ufficient for the defence of the colonies again&s;t a foreign enemy. To this, the Americans an&s;wered, that they were fully able to defend them&s;elves, and that, at any rate, as they were not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, that body had no right to tax them. To this rea&s;oning, however, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were inattentive; hence a tempe&s;t of in|dignation bur&s;t out, at once, all over the colonies: non-importation agreements were univer&s;ally embraced, and, in con&s;equence of the general alarm, the fir&s;t <HI>American Congre&s;s</HI> was held at New York 1765. Con|founded at this oppo&s;ition, the Briti&s;h cabinet &s;hrunk from its u&s;urpation, and the &s;tamp act was repealed. They, however, i&s;&s;ued a declaratory bill, &s;etting forth the authority of Britain, to bind the colonies, by laws and &s;tatutes, in all ca&s;es whatever. And in June 1767, a bill laying a duty on tea, paper, painted gla&s;s, and colours, was pa&s;&s;ed by parliament. This act excited &s;till more univer&s;al alarm and indignation, all over the continent, than even the &s;tamp act it&s;elf. Troops arri|ved
<PB N="177" REF="028800_0183_0FDD4C5B40BD25E0">
at Bo&s;ton, and it appeared to be the de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h government, to <HI>dragoon</HI> the Americans, by mili|tary logic, into &s;uch mea&s;ures, as they thought proper. The coloni&s;ts, however, remained firm, and the mini&s;try repealed all the other parts of the obnoxious act, except the duty of 3<ABBR>d</ABBR> per lb. on tea: and this was left, to main|tain, what was called, <HI>the dignity of the crown.</HI> Grie|vances multiplied, particularly in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts, and petitions, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, were pre&s;ented to the king, which, however, were treated with con|tempt. In the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, three &s;hips, laden with tea arrived Bo&s;ton and as, according to the act of parliament, it was &s;ubject to a duty of 3<ABBR>d</ABBR> per lb. 340 che&s;ts were de&s;troyed by the populace, in November 1773. On March 25, 1774, the Bo&s;ton port-bill was pa&s;&s;ed by parliament, by which bill, that port was to be &s;hut, from and after the fir&s;t June en&s;uing, till &s;atis|faction &s;hould be made to the Ea&s;t India company for the tea de&s;troyed. The Mini&s;try had expected, that the other &s;eaport towns, the commercial rivals of Bo&s;ton, would rejoice in her calamity, and that by having this opportunity of aggrandizing them&s;elves, the whole country would &s;oon be reduced to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But here they were &s;adly di&s;appointed, for contributions poured in from every quarter, and the whole continent of America was thrown into a ferment. On September 5, 1774, deputies met at Philadelphia, from the dif|ferent colonies, as the fir&s;t General Congre&s;s, and, in November following, petitoned the king for a repeal of grievances, to which, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that no attention was paid. The fir&s;t action between the Ame|ricans and king's troops was, at Lexington, April 19. 1775. On May 20, following, the colonies agreed on Articles of confederation and perpetual union. June 16, General George Wa&s;hington, was unanimou&s;ly appointed commander in chief of the American army. July 6, Congre&s;s publi&s;hed a declaration, &s;etting forth the cau&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of their taking up arms; and on July 4, 1776, in con&s;equence of the repeated provoca|tions

which the colonies had received from Britain, Congre&s;s declared the&s;e colonies to be free, &s;overeign and independent, under the name of the UNITED STATES. The different battles they fought, to obtain their liberty, have been mentioned, under the head of <HI>battles, &s;ages, &amp;c.</HI> We &s;hall, therefore only mention, that, after the &s;urrender of Cornwallis, the reduction of America appeared impracticable to the Briti&s;h, and that, in con&s;equence, an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king, again&s;t the further pro&s;ecution of offen&s;ive war in America. On May 5, following, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, with powers to treat of peace. On November 30, provi&s;ional articles of peace were &s;igned at Paris, between the American and Briti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners, by which, the United States were declared, by the king of Britain to be free, &s;overeign and inde|pendent, and the definitive treaty was ratified by Con|gre&s;s, January 4, 1784. During the war, the articles of confederation had &s;erved to keep the States united; but upon the return of peace, the general government was found, by no means to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e powers, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the right admini&s;tration of a well regulated republic. In 1785, Mr James Madi&s;on, at pre&s;ent a re|pre&s;entative in Congre&s;s, brought forward a motion in the hou&s;e of Delegates of Virginia, to appoint commi&s;|&s;ioners, who, in concurrence with others, to be ap|pointed by the different States, &s;hould form a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations, to be recommended for adop|tion to the different State legi&s;latures. In con&s;equence of this recommendation, commi&s;&s;ioners from &s;everal of the States met at Annapolis in 1786; but finding that the States were generally not repre&s;ented, and that the authority, given by &s;uch as were, fell far &s;hort of the objects to be accompli&s;hed, they agreed to reque&s;t of Congre&s;s, to recommend to the different States, to &s;end deputies to a general convention, to be held at Philadelphia, in the following year, for the purpo&s;e of devi&s;ing &s;uch a form of government, as would be&s;t pro|mote the welfare and happine&s;s of their con&s;tituents.

May 1787, the Federal convention a&s;&s;embled, and on September 17, recommended to the different States the new con&s;titution, or pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of federal go|vernment. This con&s;titution underwent the mo&s;t &s;evere examination, and after a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in the different State conventions, was at la&s;t adopted by all. The new government was organized at New York, March 3, 1789, and George Wa&s;hington was the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, John Adams the fir&s;t Vice Pre&s;ident, and Frederic Augu&s;tus Muhlenburg the fir&s;t &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. Under this excellent and hitherto wi&s;ely admini&s;tered con&s;titution, the citizens of the United States have experienced a degree of com|mercial and agricultural pro&s;perity, unknown to other nations, and while the different governments of Europe, are at pre&s;ent convul&s;ed to the very foundation, by the firm and temperate conduct of our Executive, we have &s;till enjoyed, that greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, peace. One circum&s;tance alone has tended to interrupt our tran|quillity, viz, the in&s;urrection which broke out in the counties of Allegany, Wa&s;hington, Fayette, and We&s;t|moreland in Penn&s;ylvania, on account of the exci&s;e, in 1794, This, however, was happily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the prudence of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, and the good conduct of the militia, who, at his call, readily &s;tepped forth in &s;upport of the violated laws of their country, and order was re&s;tored without blood&s;hed. Having given this cur&s;ory view of the foundation of the general government, we now proceed to the indivi|dual States, taking them according to their geogra|phical order, from North to South.</P>

To relate the many in&s;tances of rapine, de&s;olation, and inju&s;tice which a lu&s;t of gain has induced them to commit, would re|quire many volumes. Let the following extracts &s;uffice. Lord Cornwallis, in a letter dated 18th September, 1789, has the following remarkable words: "I can &s;afely affirm, that one third of the Company's territory in Indo&s;tan, is now a jungle inhabited by wild bea&s;ts;" and Colonel Dow, a Scotch officer, who had been long in India, and who wrote the hi&s;tory of Indo&s;tan, thus de&s;cribes the effect of their bar|barity in that unhappy country. "The civil wars, to which our violent de&s;ire of creating nabobs give ri&s;e, were attended with tragical events. Bengal was depopulated by every &s;pe|cies of public di&s;tre&s;s.

In con&s;equence of a me|morial which they pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s, the citizens and re&s;idents of the United States were, by a law, pa&s;&s;ed March 22, 1794, prohibited from "procuring, from any foreign kingdom, place or country, the inhabitants of &s;uch king|dom, place or country, to be tran&s;ported to any foreign country, port or place whatever, to be &s;old or di&s;po&s;ed of as <HI>&s;laves.</HI>" In January 1795, delegates from the &s;everal &s;ocieties again met in convention at Philadelphia, when they elected Benjamin Ru&s;h, M.

The French conven|tion has already declared liberty to all men without excep|tion. Long debates have taken place in the Briti&s;h parli|ament on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and it is likely, that, by that government, the trade will be &s;peedily aboli&s;hed. In &s;eve|ral of the American &s;tates there are few, and in others no &s;laves. That there &s;hould be any under a government of equal liberty, and which declares that all men are born alike free, mu&s;t to the thinking part of mankind, excite a&s;toni&s;h|ment: but the pre&s;ent citizens of the United States are too enlightened, for a much longer time, to tolerate &s;uch an enormity, which experience has confirmed to be &s;ubver|&s;ive of ju&s;tice and morality, incompatible with &s;ound po|licy, repugnant to the principles of a republican govern|ment, and contradictory to the benevolent &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian religion.</P></NOTE>, the Society for promoting the abolition of, the fir&s;t was formed in Penn&s;ylvania in 1774.</P>

<P>Plague, almo&s;t the whole world vi&s;ited by one 767 B.

The great plague, as it was emphati|cally called, at London, was brought there in &s;ome Levant goods, which came from Holland, about the clo&s;e of the year 1664. The&s;e goods were carried
<PB N="208" REF="028800_0214_0FDD4CB61F1E4B18">
to a hou&s;e near Drury Lane, where they were fir&s;t opened, and here two Frenchmen died in a few days after. The di&s;order &s;peedily communicated to other hou&s;es in the neighbourhood, when &s;everal of the in|habitants, being &s;truck with terror, removed to dif|ferent parts of the city, and thus the plague began to &s;pread. Its further progre&s;s was checked by a hard fro&s;t, which &s;et in this winter, and continued till the month of March 1665, when its virulence again revived. As &s;oon as the magi&s;trates &s;ound that the contagion extended into different parts of the city, an order was i&s;&s;ued for &s;hutting up infected hou&s;es, to &s;top the communication of the di&s;order. The&s;e hou&s;es had red cro&s;&s;es painted on the doors, with this in&s;cription, <HI>Lord, have mercy upon us!</HI> and watchmen were placed before them, to hand the af|flicted, nece&s;&s;aries and medicines, and to prevent them from coming abroad, until 40 days after their reco|very. But notwith&s;tanding every caution, the con|tagion continued to &s;pread; &s;o that in the fir&s;t week of July the bills of mortality ro&s;e to 725; the next week to 1089; the third week to 1843; and the next week to 2010: in Augu&s;t the deaths amounted to between 8 and 10,000 per week. Towards the fall, the di&s;order became le&s;s frequent, and yielded to the force of medicine; and in the winter this great enemy of mankind received an effectual check. According to the bills of mortality, the number of burials this year was 97,306; of which number 68,596, were attributed to the plague. The regi&s;|ters were, however, very inaccurately kept; and it was the opinion of eye-witne&s;&s;es, that at lea&s;t 100,000 peri&s;hed by the plague.</P>
<P>The great plague at Mar&s;eilles, in France, was brought there from Syria, in May 1720; its progre&s;s was at fir&s;t extremely &s;low, and the phy&s;icians, who had opened &s;ome dead bodies, and declared the dangerous nature of the di&s;order, were in&s;ulted by the rabble: nor was it, till the end of July, that the inhabitants began to perceive their danger. A variety of expedients were
<PB N="209" REF="028800_0215_0FDD4CB789CF8150">
then adopted to prevent the &s;preading of the di&s;temper, as well as the progre&s;s of famine, which, likewi&s;e, be|gan to &s;tare them in the face. Fires were kindled in different parts of the city, but, from experience, at Mar|&s;eilles and other places, fires appear rather to have the effect of &s;preading, than checking the progre&s;s of conta|gious di&s;orders. On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t the number of dead increa&s;ed &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, that the magi&s;trates found it impracticable to get them carried out of town to be thrown into the pits: they were, therefore, under the nece&s;&s;ity of getting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the galley &s;laves, and having them buried in the vaults of the church|yards. In the month of September the di&s;ea&s;e raged with unabated fury; in the month of October, it began to decrea&s;e without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e. In November the contagion continued to decrea&s;e; and by the fir&s;t of December, the danger was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at an end. It was not, however, entirely removed till the month of March following. The deaths were e&s;timated at be|tween 50 and 60,000.</P>

our readers may not have had an opportunity of pe|ru&s;ing the volumes which have been written on that di&s;order, we &s;hall here &s;ubjoin the following &s;hort ac|account, which, we tru&s;t, will prove acceptable to our readers.</P>
<P>This di&s;order made its fir&s;t appearance towards the latter end of July, in a lodging hou&s;e in North Water|&s;treet; and for a few weeks &s;eemed entirely confined to that vicinity. Hence it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been imported, and not generated in the city. This was the opinion of Doctors Currie, Cathrall, and many others. It was however combated by Dr. Ben|jamin Ru&s;h, who a&s;&s;erts, that the contagion was genera|ted from the &s;tench of a cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the &s;ame place where it fir&s;t made its appearances, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that vegetable putri|faction might produce &s;uch a di&s;order. For this opi|nion he has given his rea&s;ons at large, in a volume of which he has lately publi&s;hed the &s;econd edition.</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians have differed on this &s;ubject, we &s;hall not offend by hazarding an opinion. To tho&s;e who wi&s;h for particular information, we refer to their re&s;pective writings.</P>
<P>But from whatever fountain we trace this poi&s;oned &s;tream, it has de&s;troyed the lives of many thou&s;ands&mdash; and many of tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed worth. Its characteri&s;tic or leading &s;ymptoms were &s;udden debi|lity in the voluntary powers, oppre&s;&s;ive pain, giddine&s;s, &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s and di&s;tention in the ve&s;&s;els of the fore part of the head, and an oppre&s;&s;ive weight about the heart and lungs, accompanied with great angui&s;h and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. During the month of Augu&s;t, the funerals amounted to upwards of three hundred. The di&s;ea&s;e had then reached the central &s;treets of the city, and be|gan to &s;pread on all &s;ides with the greate&s;t rapidity. In September its malignance increa&s;ed amazingly. Fear pervaded the &s;toute&s;t heart; flight became general, and terror was depicted on every countenance. In this month 1400 more were added to the li&s;t of mortality. The contagion w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;till progre&s;&s;ive, and towards the
<PB N="217" REF="028800_0223_0FDD4CD3C6A556F8">
end of the month, 90 and 100 died daily. Until the middle of October, this mighty de&s;troyer went on with increa&s;ing havoc. From the 1&s;t to the 17th, upwards of 1400 fell as victims to the tremendous malady. From the 17th to the 30th the mortality gradually decrea&s;ed. In the whole month, however, the dead amounted to upwards of 2000&mdash;a dreadful number, if we con&s;ider that at this time near one half of the inhabitants had fled. Before the di&s;order became &s;o terrible, the garlic which many chewed as a preventative, could be &s;melled at &s;everal yards di&s;tance; whil&s;t others hoped to avoid in|fection by a recour&s;e to &s;melling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. &s;o that few indi|viduals could be &s;een in the &s;treets without one or other of the&s;e applied to his no&s;trils.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, experience had proved that the&s;e were inefficacious. A reliance on Divine Providence &s;ucceeded, and in the mo&s;t terrible &s;tage of the di&s;order the citizens di&s;covered the mo&s;t decent fortitude and the greate&s;t re&s;ignation. The&s;e imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown a&s;ide.</P>
<P>From the 1&s;t to the 7th of November, the mortality gradually decrea&s;ed. On the 9th, the burials, which had hitherto been &s;o exceedingly numerous, were redu|ced to &s;ix. The fugitive citizens now began to return, and the &s;treets re&s;umed their wonted life and activity.</P>
<P>During this awful calamity, as has been already ob&s;erved, terror and di&s;may generally pervaded the ci|tizens. Some were found, however, who, at the ri&s;que of their own lives, were highly in&s;trumental in &s;aving the lives of their fellow creatures. An ho&s;pital was erected at Bu&s;hhill, at the di&s;tance of about one mile from the inhabited part of the city. Thither the in|fected were &s;ent in great numbers, but from? want of cleanline&s;s and good order, the ho&s;pital and the grave were nearly the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>A committee had been appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the guar|dians of the poor in the legal di&s;charge of their duty. It was one of the fir&s;t objects of their care to remedy this evil. To &s;earch into the horrors of this di&s;mal re|ceptacle

required the fortitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Howard.</HI> Men, however, &s;tepped forth, and voluntarily undertook the arduous ta&s;k. <HI>Stephen Girard,</HI> a native of France, a wealthy merchant of this city, and <HI>Peter Helm,</HI> a na|tive of Philadelphia, both members of the committee, offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thanks to Heaven! their in|valuable lives were pre&s;erved, and their generous la|bours crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The poor now no longer con&s;idered Bu&s;hhill as the anti-chamber of the grave; but as a humane provi&s;ion for the nece&s;&s;itous &s;ick: and now many recovered.</P>
<P>So great a mortality of cour&s;e left a great number of orphans in very de&s;titute circum&s;tances. Here again was a large field of labour open for the benevolent. The children were to be provided with nur&s;es, provi|&s;ions, and other accommodations. The committee, how|ever, to their former burthens undertook this, and pro|cured the Loganian library, which was fitted up as an orphan-hou&s;e, where about two hundred children were admitted, &s;ixty of whom were infants.</P>
<P>The accumulating expences of this in&s;titution, with that of Bu&s;hhill and many others, obviou&s;ly required con&s;iderable &s;ums of money. Liberal contributions were &s;ent from different quarters, amounting in the whole to 29,085 dollars.</P>
<P>During this melancholy period the city lo&s;t ten of her mo&s;t valuable phy&s;icians, and mo&s;t of the others were &s;ick at different times. The number of deaths in all, amounted to about 5000.</P>
<P>To omit recording the names of tho&s;e by who&s;e be|nevolent exertions, under Divine Providence, the city was &s;aved from utter de&s;truction, would be highly culpable in any annali&s;t. To perpetuate the <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> ac|quired fame of tho&s;e who have made them&s;elves con|&s;picuous by butchering thou&s;ands of their fellow-crea|tures, &s;tatues have been often erected; but what re|wards, what &s;tatues, what language can &s;ufficiently de|&s;cribe the merits of tho&s;e, who, at the imminent dan|ger of their own invaluable lives, have &s;o eminently conduced to the &s;afety of a great city?
