<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> FIRST, Concerning the <HI>Nature of Publick Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip;</HI> con&s;ider'd in both its Parts, E&s;&s;ential and Circum&s;tantial.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Wor&s;hip of God in general, is a Duty &s;o evidently ari&s;ing from the Relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and his Creatures, that the very fir&s;t Reflections of human Rea&s;on, not only recommend, but as it were, oblige us to it. The &s;lighte&s;t View of our own Con&s;titution and Powers, immedi|ately di&s;covers to us, that we &s;tand in need of &s;ome foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and puts us upon that important Enquiry, Whence we came, and whither we all tend? And the natural and nece&s;&s;ary An&s;wer to &s;uch an Enquiry, leads us directly to God the &s;upreme Author and Original of all Things; and to acknow|ledge with the P&s;almi&s;t, that <HI>it is he who
<PB N="4" REF="006107_0004_1027E848C53B2450" MS="y">hath made us, and not we our&s;elves;</HI> and that <HI>we are his People, and the Sheep of his Pa|&s;ture.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;uch an Acknowledgment as this, teaches us, that it is both our Intere&s;t and Duty, to cultivate in our Minds, a &s;upreme Regard towards &s;o great and glorious a Being; to &s;tudy and exert our utmo&s;t Powers, to engage his Favour; to get acquainted with his Excellencies and Perfections; and to di&s;|cover what Conduct will be mo&s;t plea&s;ing and acceptable to him.</P>
<P>When the divine Being is thus con&s;ider'd, as infinitely removed from our narrow and limited Exi&s;tence, we are naturally led to ca&s;t our Eyes towards him, and implore the Succours which our Weakne&s;s and Imper|fection require; to humble our&s;elves before him, in Con&s;ideration of his tran&s;cendant Greatne&s;s; and to hope for a Supply from his inexhau&s;ted Fulne&s;s.&mdash;And this Acknow|ledgment of the Perfections of God, and humble Addre&s;s to him for the Supply of our Wants, is what is called <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>But then, be&s;ides this;&mdash;when we con&s;ider him as the Author of our Being, and of that glorious Show of Things which is exhibited
<PB N="5" REF="006107_0005_1027E84CAD4A8350" MS="y">to us in this vi&s;ible World, there ari&s;es a Principle of Gratitude in our Brea&s;ts, and the Joy of our Hearts breaks forth in Thank&s;|giving for this his Goodne&s;s, and in Adoration of his a&s;toni&s;hing Power and Pre&s;ence.&mdash;And this is what is properly &s;til'd <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And of tho&s;e two Parts <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e;</HI> which thus naturally ari&s;e from the Con&s;ideration of that Relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and his Creatures, does Wor&s;hip or Homage in general con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Duty therefore of wor&s;hipping God, is plainly a Principle of natural Religion.&mdash; But if we examine the Nature of joint Wor|&s;hip, or a publick &s;ocial Service, this we &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll find to ari&s;e from Revelation:<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> we are i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll is al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">p ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d to us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> We are enco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Man f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it with united <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts and Vel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s; gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that we e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> him the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of us all; that we are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l his Childr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and Servants; all of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, Pacia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>For the right Under&s;tanding the ju&s;t Na|ture and Extent of publick Chri&s;tian Wor|&s;hip, we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as di&s;tingui&s;hed into the&s;e two Parts or Branches; <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tantial.</HI></P>

And this is therefore called natural Homage or Wor&s;hip, which con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e Duties, that are di&s;coverable by the Light of Nature.&mdash;Accordingly all Forms of Religion that ever appeared, whether natural or re|vealed, have either directly or figuratively included the&s;e two e&s;&s;ential Parts of Wor|&s;hip, <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. Two other Parts of Divine Wor&s;hip; which tho' not naturally &s;uch, yet are made e&s;&s;ential, by po&s;itive divine Command. There are the two Chri&s;tian Sacraments, Bapti&s;m, and the Lord's Supper. The former a reli|gious Con&s;truct, Stipulation, or Covenant,
<PB N="9" REF="006107_0009_1027E8568B5B5940">which we enter into when fir&s;t we take the Chri&s;tian Name or Profe&s;&s;ion upon us: &mdash;And the latter a &s;olemn and thankful Re|cognition or Renewing of that Covenant, accompanied with holy Prayer and Than&s;|givings.&mdash;And the&s;e two po&s;itive or arbitrary Parts of Wor&s;hip, are the very Things that di&s;tingui&s;h the Chri&s;tian from all other Forms of Wor&s;hip. All or mo&s;t other Forms of religious Adoration, con&s;i&s;t of Prayer and Prai&s;e; but by the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution, the&s;e two po&s;itive Precepts are &s;uperadded, of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper; and required to be received as mo&s;t &s;olemn Parts of the Chri&s;tian Service.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential Parts of Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, whether natural or po|&s;itive.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that even the Scrip|tures them&s;elves have not pre&s;ented us in one &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age, nor delineated in one View, all the &s;everal Parts of Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, its e&s;&s;ential Branches, and circum&s;tantial Appen|dages; but from the many Pa&s;&s;ages wherein they treat of this Subject, we are left to col|lect the &s;everal Parts of it, and unite them into one Scheme.&mdash;Our Saviour's De&s;ign,
<PB N="10" REF="006107_0010_1027E85B98958C70">was not wholly to take away, but to improve only and perfect the Law of Nature, and that of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> To this End, it was nor nece&s;&s;ary to repeat tho&s;e Things which before were &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed; but to rectify that which was corrupted, re&s;tore that which was lo&s;t, and &s;upply what was wanting, to a com|pleat Sy&s;tem of Religion.&mdash;Our Saviour in|deed in pronouncing a Summary of Religion, comprehends the Whole, in two &s;hort, but very exten&s;ive Precepts, <HI>the Love of God, and of one another.</HI> And St. <HI>James</HI> is equally conci&s;e, when de&s;cribing the Nature of pure Religion, he makes it to con&s;i&s;t only in this, that a Man <HI>vi&s;it the Fatherle&s;s and the Widows in their Affliction, and keep him&s;elf un&s;potted from the World.</HI> But whoever undertakes to pur&s;ue the&s;e general and comprehen&s;ive Pre|cepts into all the Branches they include, will find it nece&s;&s;ary to attend to a great Number: not incon&s;i&s;tent indeed, but &s;ubordinate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e general Directions. Thus tho' the New Te&s;tament confirms the Belief and Obe|dience of one God, yet it teaches us to apply to him under the Notion and Di&s;tinction of Father; Son, and Holy Gho&s;t: And our Addre&s;&s;es are therefore offer'd to the Father,

<P>Time and Place are nece&s;&s;ary to the Performance of Divine Wor&s;hip.&mdash;The&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="006107_0015_1027E86902C93220" MS="y">are no Parts of Wor&s;hip them&s;elves; and yet they have &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Relation to it, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to perform any without them. Now the&s;e are Things about which the Scrip|tures are entirely &s;ilent. Examples indeed we have, of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians meeting to|gether upon the Lord's Day; and for &s;undry other Rea&s;ons, the Chri&s;tian Church has con|tinued the Practice of meeting together upon this Day, to perform their publick Devotions: But with regard to Place; this is a Thing of &s;uch a Nature, that no provi&s;ionary Canon could have been made, no &s;ettled Rule ap|pointed; nor could any Example pre&s;cribe to after Ages. The Apo&s;tles and their Con|verts might for &s;ome &s;hort Time po&s;&s;ibly have met together in &s;ome one Place; but the Number of the Faithful &s;oon encrea&s;ed beyond the Po&s;&s;ibility of this. And if we reflect that the Go&s;pel was to be propagated throughout the World, we may ea&s;ily imagine that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;cribe &s;et Places for them all, and for all future Occa&s;i|ons; out of which it would be unlawful for them to hold their publick A&s;&s;emblies.&mdash;There is indeed one general provi&s;ionary Rule intended by the Apo&s;tle as a Pre&s;cription for all Things

II. I proceed therefore to the &s;econd general Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> How this Wor&s;hip ought to be perform'd.</P>
<P>Now ina&s;much as the human Nature con|&s;i&s;ts of two Parts, Body and Soul; the Ho|mage that is due to God, mu&s;t be adapted to both the&s;e Parts of our Compo&s;ition; and mu&s;t accordingly con&s;i&s;t of inward Concep|tions and outward Expre&s;&s;ions, agreeable to that of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>If thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy Mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in thine Heart, that God hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> In our private Devotions, the&s;e external Expre&s;&s;ions of our inward Reverence, are not perhaps &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as they are in publick Devotions; becau&s;e God as ea&s;ily apprehends the Conceptions of the Heart, as the Expre&s;|&s;ions of the Mouth.&mdash;Thus we are inform'd that <HI>Hannah</HI> prayed, and that with Succe&s;s, without any audible Voice or Expre&s;&s;ion of her Reque&s;ts; for we are told, that <HI>her Lips only moved, but her Voice was not heard.</HI> 1 Sam. 1.13.&mdash;But yet truly con&s;ider'd, this was rather an Act of Mediation or holy A&s;piration, wherein &s;he breathed forth her Soul to God, than any formal Act of Prayer.
<PB N="18" REF="006107_0018_1027E8725407B368" MS="y">And it was doubtle&s;s the Singularity of the Thing which occa&s;ioned old <HI>Eli</HI> to mi&s;interpret her Conduct, and charge her with Intempe|rance. &mdash;And there is this Rea&s;on why even our private Devotions &s;hould be expre&s;s'd with the Mouth, as well as conceived with the Heart; that God requires the Devotion of the whole Man, as he is a Compound of Soul and Body; both which are required to render due Honour to his Maje&s;ty, and to prai&s;e his Goodne&s;s; becau&s;e he is the Creator of the Body, as well as the Father of our Spi|rits.&mdash;Neither does this at all interfere with our Saviour's Caution of entring into the Clo&s;et, and praying in &s;ecret; for in our Retirements, we may doubtle&s;s expre&s;s the Conceptions of our Hearts, without being either &s;een or heard of Men.</P>
<P>But as to the publick Devotions, the Con|currence of the outward Man is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that I do not &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to di&s;charge it at all; to be &s;ure not in any con&s;i&s;tent Manner, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of bodily Organs.&mdash;This is &s;o very clear and plain, that one would think it did not need in&s;i&s;ting on; but ina&s;much as a long Practice to the Contrary has inclined many to think
<PB N="19" REF="006107_0019_1027E873DDB62F98" MS="y">favourably of it, I &s;hall con&s;ider it parti|cularly.</P>
<P>And in Order to this, I &s;hall take it for granted.</P>
<P><HI>Po&s;tul.</HI> 1. In the fir&s;t Place, that what Duty &s;oever one Man owes to God, as his Creator, Redeemer, Benefactor, or the like, no other Man is able to di&s;charge for him.&mdash; Every Man's Duty of this Kind, is his own, his per&s;onal Duty; and which therefore, unle&s;s the Man him&s;elf performs, it is not di&s;charged at all. Another Man may pray with me, or intercede for me; but then it is plain &s;uch Prayers is not mine, but his.&mdash; God will not accept of another Per&s;on's Ac|knowledgment of my Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ex|cu&s;e me from paying that Acknowledgment my&s;elf.&mdash;What is immediately owning from me of this Nature, I my&s;elf mu&s;t di&s;charge, or el&s;e it is not truly di&s;charg'd.&mdash;God might indeed have accepted of vicarious Interc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion or Mediation; and &s;o he has done in the Per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but all Mankind be|&s;ides are utterly excluded. <HI>No Man</HI> (&s;ays the Scripture) <HI>can redeem the Soul of his Brother, nor make Agreement with God for him;</HI> and the Rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e they are all
<PB N="20" REF="006107_0020_1027E875692DDAD8" MS="y">Sinners; and therefore incapable of di&s;charging their own Debts.</P>
<P><HI>Po&s;tul.</HI> 2. The &s;econd Thing which I &s;hall take for granted, is this:&mdash;That publick De|votion is the joint Concurrence of Two, Three, or more Per&s;ons&punc; in paying their Homage to God. This, I &s;ay, is what is under&s;tood by publick Devotion; for tho' the Wor&s;hip of one &s;ingle Per&s;on, if it be per|formed before Numbers of People, may in that Re&s;pect, be called publick, becau&s;e it is publickly and openly di&s;charged; yet that which is generally e&s;teemed to be publick Wor&s;hip, is a joint or &s;ocial Service, in which &s;everal People unite to prefer their common Reque&s;ts to God.</P>
<P><HI>Coro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> New the&s;e two Points being granted, it will from hence follow;&mdash;that every Per|&s;on in the Congregation, is obliged to expre&s;s his Prayers and Prai&s;es before God, in &s;uch common, fit, and proper Words, Actions, Ge|&s;tures, and the like, as are declarative of his inward Conceptions.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, <HI>every Per&s;on</HI> is obliged to this.&mdash; This will follow from what was before granted, that every Man is obliged to do his own Duty, and not to depend upon any other to do it for him.</P>

2. He mu&s;t al&s;o expre&s;s this Duty, by proper Words, or Ge&s;tures, or both; other|wi&s;e there would not be a joint Concurrence of the whole Congregation; ina&s;much as no one Man knows what another conceives in his Heart.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the &s;everal Characters of publick divine Wor&s;hip; con&s;ider'd in both its Parts, Internal and External; or the Devotion of the Mind, and the Homage of the Body: God requires them both you &s;ee; and they are both of them expre&s;s'd in my Text; the Former in tho&s;e Words, <HI>O come let us wor&s;hip the Lord;</HI> and the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er in the following Clau&s;e, <HI>Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before the Lord our Maker.</HI> They are both of them indeed but one and the &s;ame Act of Wor&s;hip: One being the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ceiving proper Sentimen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the divine Being; and the other the expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Sentiments or Con|ceptions before him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed to examine our own publick Service, and &s;ee whether it an&s;wers the &s;everal Characters of Publick Wor&s;hip,
<PB N="25" REF="006107_0025_1027E882E8128798" MS="y">before laid down and de&s;cribed to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary; but before I proceed to this, I &s;hall make an Inference or two, from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t Remark I &s;hall make, is this, That &s;eeing the publick Wor&s;hip of God con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts, outward and in|ward; and moreover that the&s;e two Parts make but one and the &s;ame Act of Wor&s;hip: It from hence follows, that they who pre|&s;ume to neglect either of the&s;e Parts, do ma|nife&s;tly di&s;charge this Duty very imperfectly, if indeed they can be &s;aid to perform it at all.&mdash; If the internal Part, or the Homage of the Mind be omitted, there is nothing left but Formality and Lip-Service. And if the Wor&s;hip of the Body is neglected, the very Notion of a joint &s;ocial Wor&s;hip is de|&s;troyed; the Honour due to God is with|drawn; and all our devout and pious Senti|ments and Conceptions, are &s;mother'd and concealed, for want of proper In&s;truments to di&s;cover and expre&s;s them&s;elves. It is there|fore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Nature of publick Wor&s;hip, and of great Importance in it&s;elf, that we join the&s;e Two together; and not pre&s;ume to put a&s;under what God has
<PB N="26" REF="006107_0026_1027E884C8AE36B8" MS="y">thus manife&s;tly united: That we form in our Minds proper Conceptions of God; and then employ all our Faculties in expre&s;&s;ing before him, what we have thus piou&s;ly con|ceived.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foregoing Reflections, do &s;urely admini&s;ter abundant Matter of Reproof, to all &s;uch, as tho' they confe&s;s the Truth of the&s;e Things, do yet incon&s;iderately neglect to comply with them. Nothing is more common, than to &s;ee a large Part of our A&s;&s;emblies utterly &s;ilent, as if they were wholly unconcern'd, while the Other are tuning their Voices to the Prai&s;e of the God who made them. No Man, I am &s;ure, can be &s;o &s;tupid, as to imagine, that he prai&s;es God, by giving his Attention to what an|other performs of this Kind; but he mu&s;t perceive it to be his Duty to join his own Endeavours, and to employ his own Facul|ties, to advance the common Devotion; nor is it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, he wants a Voice; for he ought to employ that which he has, in the be&s;t Manner it will bear: Nor yet that he wants Skill; for why don't he labour to acquire it:&mdash;Certainly the Promi&s;es God has made to our Obedience, and the Benefits he
<PB N="27" REF="006107_0027_1027E88A63F5CB98" MS="y">has conferr'd upon us, de&s;erve that we &s;hould take &s;ome Pains to qualify our&s;elves for his Service.</P>
<P>But even this Excu&s;e is wanting, to tho&s;e who neglect to join in the common Prayers; in which the Church has been &s;o very in|dulgent, and tender, and careful of all her Children, as to provide them with the be&s;t and mo&s;t familiar Helps to this Duty. She puts a Form into all their Mouths; and it mu&s;t be exceeding Stupidity not to make U&s;e of it. In this Ca&s;e there needs no tune|able Voice; nothing but a Capacity to read, nay, and &s;carcely that; for what is thus con|&s;tantly u&s;ed, will in a &s;hort Time, be trea|&s;ured up in the Memory, if it be duly at|tended, and be ready upon every Occa&s;ion, to expre&s;s the devout and pious Sentiments of the Heart.</P>
<P>And &s;urely nothing but utter Incon&s;idera|tion, could have produced &s;uch a fatal Neg|lect (and I fear Contempt al&s;o may follow) of the publick Service.&mdash;For I would only a&s;k any Man, what his De&s;ign is, in giving his Attendance at the Hou&s;e of God? Whether he comes there for a Vi&s;it? and not rather to pay publick Homage and Adoration to God?
<PB N="28" REF="006107_0028_1027E88C00DFD4C8" MS="y">If &s;o, let him reflect, whether he can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived in any Sen&s;e what&s;oever, to have di&s;charged this Duty, by &s;eeing and hearing others pray and prai&s;e God, without bearing any Part in the&s;e Devotions him&s;elf? Has &s;uch a Man honoured God in his ap|proaches to him? Has he made u&s;e of the Faculties God has graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on him, in &s;etting forth his Prai&s;e?

Now, as to the fir&s;t Particular.

<P>In &s;hort, every Per&s;on who has a &s;incere De&s;ire to become good and holy, and who would be &s;ure to offer an acceptable Sacrifice before God, is here furni&s;hed with Devotions proper for his Purpo&s;e: And if he but takes Care to bring with him a &s;uitable Frame and Temper of Mind, &s;hall never fail of receiving the Things he &s;tands in need of. For &s;uch an One fully an&s;wers the P&s;almi&s;t's Exhortation in my Text, <HI>O come let us wor&s;hip the Lord, let us bow down and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI></P>
<P>And now after &s;uch an Examination of our publick Service, in which we may di&s;cover &s;o much Propriety, &s;o many Beauties, &s;o much Piety; is it not &s;trange, that &s;uch a well-com|po&s;ed Form of publick Devotion, &s;hould have any Enemies? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y that di&s;regard, that &s;peak Evil f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tly again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doubtle&s;s it is. But much more &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it is, that any who have &s;tudied,
<PB N="46" REF="006107_0046_1027E8BC32858478" MS="y">who have approved, and who profe&s;s to ad|mire it; that &s;uch as the&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;hould in|con&s;iderately neglect to make u&s;e of it; to improve and reap the&s;e Advantages from it, which it is &s;o fruitful of, and which it is &s;o capable of yielding; this is beyond Mea&s;ure &s;urpri&s;ing!&mdash;And yet, how many do we find pre&s;ent in our A&s;&s;emblies, unmoved, &s;ilent, and it may be fear'd often unaffected, while this &s;olemn Sacrifice is offer'd to God.</P>
<P>Let me &s;eriou&s;ly expo&s;tulate with &s;uch Peo|ple: Have you no Petitions, no Reque&s;ts to prefer to the Throne of God's Grace? Are you in the Condition of the <HI>Laodiceans,</HI> who thought them&s;elves <HI>rich and increa&s;ed in Goods, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad need of nothing?</HI> Are you al&s;o rich in Grace, and fruitful in good Works? Happy are ye; O People, and highly favour'd of the Lord. But there is one Thing wanting: God expects the Fruit of all this va&s;t Profu&s;ion of his Benefits. Ought you not to prai&s;e the Name of God with a Song, and to magnify it with Thank&s;giving, to give him the Honour due to his holy Name, and to &s;pread abroad his glorious Prai&s;e? Or perhaps that you are content that others &s;hould relate the noble Acts of the Lord, while you &s;ilently admire his Goodne&s;s? But for what end was publick
<PB N="47" REF="006107_0047_1027E8BEE7ED0220" MS="y">Wor&s;hip in&s;tituted? Was it not, that the whole Congregation &s;hould unite together, in addre&s;&s;ing God with joint Reque&s;ts, and offer|ing up joint and common Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s? In &s;hort, &s;uch Neglect is &s;o manife&s;tly faulty, and &s;o in|de&s;pen&s;ible, that it would be an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the common Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nd, to pre&s;s the Point any further.</P>
<P>I &s;hall rather therefore as a Conclu&s;ion, la|bour to per&s;uade you to &s;tudy the Liturgy or publick Service of the Church. Get but once throughly acquainted with it, and you will di&s;cover &s;o much Propriety, &s;o many Beauties, &s;o much &s;piritual Con&s;olation, and &s;uch a Vein of Piety breathing through the Whole, as will abundantly endear it to you, and fully re|compence the Trouble of the Search.</P>
<P>Were you under the unhappy Circum&s;tances of the Romi&s;h Church, who&s;e Service the People generally do not under&s;tand; and therefore neither can they Profit by it; how would you mourn for an Opportunity of &s;erving God? Were you, as in &s;ome other Churches, deny'd the Privilege of making your own addre&s;&s;es immediately to God, how great on Injury mu&s;t you &s;uffer? There is one Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Through him you are all
<PB N="48" REF="006107_0048_1027E8C075454888" MS="y">allow'd the Honour of approaching God, without the Mediation of &s;inful Man. Why &s;hould you then carve out to your&s;elves, Me|diators among&s;t your Brethren, &s;inful like your&s;elves; and tru&s;t to them the Preferring all your Reque&s;ts, and all your Prayers to God?</P>
<P>But when you are invited, encou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aged, and exhorted to a&s;&s;ert this your Honour and Pri|vilege; when the be&s;t Provi&s;ion is made to this Purpo&s;e, then, I &s;ay, not to make u&s;e of it, is the very lowe&s;t Stupidity.</P>
<P>Let us therefore for the Future, be per|&s;uaded to <HI>wor&s;hip the Lord. Let us fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> Let us e&s;teem it, as indeed it is, our va&s;t Pri|vilege and Honour, that we have Liberty of Acce&s;s to God; that we are allow'd to hold &s;piritual Communion and Conver&s;e with the God of Heaven; that we are at Liberty to pour out our Souls before him, in Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ence that he will hear from his dwelling Place on high, and an&s;wer all our rea&s;onable Reque&s;ts.</P>
