</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EVERY Engli&s;hman mu&s;t deplore the ill &s;ucce&s;s, and abhor the unworthy treatment which attended the two late conciliatory plans in relation to America. Pregnant with good &s;en&s;e, benevolence, and &s;ound rea&s;on, they will do eternal honor to the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, policy, and humanity of the heads and hearts that formed them. How different was the plan of North. Crafty, mean, in|&s;idious, impolitic, irrational, &s;hallow, and (like him&s;elf and his coadjutors) beneath contempt. This was not treating with America, but in&s;ulting her, every &s;tep again&s;t her hitherto has been found|ed in the greate&s;t inhumanity, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance, and the wor&s;t policy. I will proceed to prove my a&s;&s;ertions, and defy the whole cabal of mini&s;terial &s;laughtermen to confute me. I do not call upon the ma&s;ter-butcher, becau&s;e he can only be con&s;idered
<PB N="106" REF="013977_0002_0F925A47FAF304C8">(after the part he has acted by a&s;&s;erting) an executive, and not as a rational ma&s;ter in this bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Fir&s;t then, for the humanity of the&s;e proceedings, let it be granted only, as it mu&s;t, that the crown &s;tands in the &s;ame relation to America as a parent to her child, and my fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion proves it&s;elf. Have any gentle, tender, &s;en&s;ible means been u&s;ed to reconcile her? Have not her humble remon&s;trances, propo&s;als, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and &s;upplications, been treated with contempt? Not &s;uffered to lie upon the table of a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons? Have they been deem|ed worthy of a thought by her pious Sovereign? Has &s;he not been branded with the ignominious name of rebel by act of Parliament, for no other rea&s;on (I mean no true one) than becau&s;e &s;he has wi&s;ely and calmly diliberated upon, remon&s;trated again&s;t, and &s;teadily, but not tumultuou&s;ly, re&s;ented the repeated injuries &s;he has received? As to riots by mobs, they are not to be imputed to her as trea&s;on and rebellion. America (as a nation mo&s;t uncon&s;titu|tionally oppre&s;&s;ed) has hitherto only deliberated upon her &s;ufferings. She has not acted. My Lords Suffolk, Pomfret, Radnor, Ap&s;ley, Sandwich, they have not acted. It is as yet no trea&s;on, my Lords, to think, to advi&s;e, to fear, and to prepare. You cannot, you dare not, move to annul (as you may wi&s;h) the &s;tatute of trea&s;ons in America. The Americans have as good a right to that as your Lord&s;hips. I mean as yet, my Lords, becau&s;e I am not quite &s;atisfied that (even in the pre&s;ent &s;muggled and corrupt Parliament) the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t venal pro&s;titute dur&s;t make &s;o dangerous a trial upon the patience and long &s;ufferance, of this king|dom. I will now inform your Lord&s;hips that it is contrary to the law of nations to attempt the de|&s;truction even of the mo&s;t inveterate enemy by
<PB N="107" REF="013977_0003_0F925A48CA71E3A0">famine, until he has been fir&s;t &s;olemnly &s;ummoned to &s;ubmit. Have the Americans ever yet been (though if men they &s;hortly will be) in arms? Have they yet had a pro&s;pect of any other terms than &s;uch as would make them &s;laves? Will they be weak enough to &s;ubmit to &s;uch conditions? The prelimi|naries, hitherto propo&s;ed, have been founded in op|pre&s;&s;ion, not in rea&s;on; they are fit for brutes, not men. The lenient, the compa&s;&s;ionate North has treated America like the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of an alley, with his knife at her throat he has humanely left it at her choice to &s;trip her&s;elf for fear &s;he &s;hould be &s;tripped by him. Why have the mini&s;try had recour&s;e at fir&s;t to this inhuman &s;cheme of famine? They fear the army will relent, when they find they mu&s;t wade through the Hood of their own countrymen. Their pre&s;ent General (Gage) has, to his honor, declined the bloody ta&s;k. Even a foreigner, to whom the &s;ame command was offered, has revol|ted at the thought. Is not this &s;tratagem of &s;tarv|ing freemen into &s;lavery the mo&s;t inhuman, as well as the mo&s;t cowardly of all others, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that all the remon&s;trances of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers have been rejected? I &s;hould in&s;ult the reader's under&s;tanding by wait|ing for a reply, I therefore come to the next in|gredient in the American per&s;ecution, ignorance. I mu&s;t fir&s;t remark that &s;ome of their wi&s;e Lord|&s;hips were for having Maryland and Virginia (very remote inland countries) prohibited from the fi&s;hery. Thus far have &s;ome of the great and &s;age coun|&s;ellors of this nation been ignorant even of the &s;itu|ation of that part of their fellow creatures, whom they wi&s;h to involve in the mo&s;t dreadful of all ca|lamities, famine. But the very &s;cheme it&s;elf is impracticable; the&s;e wretched people cannot be to|tally
<PB N="108" REF="013977_0004_0F925A498EB430D0">de&s;troyed either by butchery or famine; their numbers are great and formidable; in &s;uch a va&s;t extent of country their re&s;ources will be endle&s;s; they are not de&s;titute of arms already, and they will be &s;upplied with more in &s;pite of our vigilant fleet. They have all the materials nece&s;&s;ary for war in the bowels of their country; they have ar|ti&s;ts, handicraft&s;men, manufacturers, and mecha|nics of all &s;orts; cattle of all kinds; fruit of the earth in va&s;t abundance; fine &s;treams and rivers; though no doubt admini&s;tration (for the &s;ake of con&s;i&s;tency) will give &s;trict orders, and pay highly for the poi&s;oning of the&s;e; but that will not ea&s;ily be effected; the&s;e people in general know the u&s;e of arms; they have per&s;everance, courage, re&s;o|lution, and above all (mo&s;t prophetic Lord Sand|wich!) they have virtue, which can never be over|come. Should our army &s;trike and fail, the hatred enmity and revolt of America is fixed for ever; they never will &s;ubmit to lick the tyrant hand, which has once been rai&s;ed again&s;t their liberties, their properties, and their lives. Under the above con&s;iderations, the pre&s;ent &s;cheme of government mu&s;t &s;eem impracticable; if &s;o, or if from ran|cour and re&s;entment it has been viewed but parti|ally, it is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance to pur&s;ue it. Should heaven interpo&s;e on the &s;ide of ju&s;tice, we &s;hall perceive our error too late; but were our at|tempts by &s;word or famine &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, go|vernment is only de&s;troying its own vitals.&mdash;What then is the policy of this unnatural war? It is like the war between the belly and the other members; the whole &s;tate mu&s;t feel its con&s;equences. Shal|low North told the Hou&s;e of Commons (for it is his) that the imports from the American Continent were incon&s;iderable. Now, my Lord, you ought
<PB N="109" REF="013977_0005_0F925A4DC9C1E108">to know (and in honor you &s;hould have declared) that the imports of that part of America into our &s;ugar Colonies were the very life of them; neither planters, nor Negroes, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them, particularly in the prohibited, interidicted article of fi&s;h, which, when &s;alted, is their general food. Your Lord&s;hip, by your war, and your intended famine, has effectually &s;tarved and ruined all the pa&s;&s;ive and obedient &s;ugar Colonies, as well as your declared enemies in America. Thus a mo&s;t valua|ble fi&s;hery, a con&s;iderable &s;ugar trade, and thou|&s;ands (perhaps millions) of innocent and brave lives will be &s;acrificed by a narrow minded mini&s;try to wicked views, and in&s;atiable re&s;entments, in the reign of a Monarch born a Briton! An ancient Pict, or a wild Indian (&s;avage in their natures) would blu&s;h and &s;hudder at &s;uch proceedings. With the Colonies and trade the revenues mu&s;t &s;ink. If royal profu&s;ion, and mini&s;terial corrup|tion, were to &s;ink likewi&s;e, it would be well; but they will &s;till attempt to draw blood from the mo&s;t impoveri&s;hed veins. The commercial, the landed intere&s;t, the public bank, at la&s;t, mu&s;t feel the &s;hock. Then, perhaps, when famine threatens at our own doors, the Briti&s;h lion will be rou&s;ed.&mdash;Then (for I will prophecy in my turn) comes a revolu|tion, fatal to minions, pen&s;ioners, placemen, knaves and tyrants; but happy for the nation, if from the a&s;hes of all the&s;e pe&s;ts, the rights of &s;uffering and in&s;ulted Engli&s;hmen can be once more e&s;tabli&s;hed. We &s;hall find it to our co&s;t, in vain to &s;end Engli&s;h &s;oldiers (none but Scotch will do the bu&s;i|ne&s;s) again&s;t Engli&s;h brea&s;ts. I am of opinion (let the wi&s;hes of the mini&s;try be what they will) that if every officer who goes upon this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination were a Burgoyne, he would be di&s;appointed of the
<PB N="110" REF="013977_0006_0F925A4FAC9525A0">blood he pants for, his command will be a &s;inecure, and his victory a brave and virtuous de&s;ertion. All who de&s;erved the names of &s;oldiers, would throw down their arms, and embrace their gallant and unhappy countrymen. An Engli&s;h army will not, and a navy cannot, de&s;troy the liberties of America; the mini&s;try, who wi&s;h to deceive the nation, are (as they frequently are) deceived them&s;elves; they cannot execute their plan without extraordinary and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive (almo&s;t perpetual) drafts of forces. Should the patient &s;pirit of this kingdom ri&s;e at &s;uch a time in arms, and France and Spain add to the horrors of a civil war, even in the mid&s;t of the&s;e calamities it will be &s;ome con&s;olation that the ad|vi&s;ers, abettors, and dete&s;table heads of the&s;e dia|bolical mea&s;ures, cannot long e&s;cape the vengeance of an injured people. CASCA.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we have given almo&s;t the u&s;ual quantity of matter already, we cannot here omit, without injury to our readers and the cau&s;e of li|berty, the &s;pirited city remon&s;trance which will do immortal honor to the heads and hearts of tho&s;e who framed it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>The ADDRESS, REMONSTRANCE and PETITION of the CITY of LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>"We your Maje&s;ty's dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery of the city of London, beg leave to approach the throne, and to declare our abhorrence of the mea&s;ures which have been pur&s;ued, and are now pur&s;uing, to the oppre&s;&s;ion of our fellow &s;ubjects in America. The&s;e mea&s;ures are big with all the con&s;equences which can alarm a free and commercial people. A deep and perhaps a fatal wound to commerce; the ruin of manufactures; the diminution of the revenue, and con&s;equent increa&s;e of taxes; the alienation of the Colonies; and the blood of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But your petitioners look with le&s;s horror at the con&s;equen|ces, than at the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e mea&s;ures. Not deceived by the &s;pecious artifice of calling de&s;poti&s;m dignity, they plainly perceive that the real purpo&s;e is&mdash;To e&s;tabli&s;h arbritrary power over all America.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="013977_0007_0F925A51034A9338">
Your petitioners conceive the liberties of the whole to be inevitably connected with tho&s;e of every part of an empire founded on the common rights of mankind. They cannot therefore ob&s;erve, without the greate&s;t concern and alarm, the con&s;titution fundamentally violated in any part of your Ma|je&s;ty's dominions. They e&s;teem it an e&s;&s;ential and unalterable principle of liberty, the &s;ource and &s;ecurity of all con&s;titu|tional rights, that no part of the dominion can be taxed with|out being repre&s;ented. Upon this great leading principle, they mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to &s;ee their fellow &s;ubjects in America &s;ecured in what their humble petition to your Maje&s;ty prays for, peace, liberty and &s;afety.&mdash;Subordination in commerce, under which the Colonies have always cheerfully acquie&s;ced, is, they conceive, all that this country ought in ju&s;tice to re|quire. From this &s;ubordination &s;uch advantages flow, by all the profits of their commerce centering here, as fully com|pen&s;ate this nation for the expence incurred, to which they al&s;o contribute in men and money for their defence and protec|tion during a general war; and in their Provincial wars they have manife&s;ted their readine&s;s and re&s;olution to defend them|&s;elves. To require more of them would, for this rea&s;on, de|rogate from the ju&s;tice and magnanimity which have been hi|therto the pride and character of this country.</P>
<P>It is therefore with the deepe&s;t concern, that we have &s;een the &s;acred &s;ecurity of repre&s;entation in their a&s;&s;emblies wre&s;ted from them; the trial by jury aboli&s;hed; and the odious pow|ers of exci&s;e extended to all ca&s;es of revenue; the &s;anc|tuary of their hou&s;es laid open to violation at the will and plea&s;ure of every officer and &s;ervant in the cu&s;toms; the di&s;|pen&s;ation of ju&s;tice corrupted, by rendering their Judges de|pendent for their &s;eats and &s;alaries on the will of the crown; liberty and life rendered precarious by &s;ubjecting them to be dragged over the ocean, and tried for trea&s;on or felony here; where the di&s;tance, making it impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t guiltle&s;s to maintain his innocence, mu&s;t deliver him up a victim to mini&s;terial vengeance; &s;oldiers and others in Ame|rica have been in&s;tigated to &s;hed the blood of the people, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a mode of trial which holds out impunity for &s;uch murder; the capital of New-England has been puni&s;hed with unexempled rigour, untried and unheard, involving the innocent and the &s;u&s;pected in one common and inhuman cala|mity; chartered rights have been taken away, without: any forfeiture proved, in order to deprive the people of every le|gal exertion again&s;t the tyranny of their rulers; the Habeas Corpus act, and trial by Jury, have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and French de&s;potic government, with the Roman Catholic religi|on, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, over an exten&s;ive part of
<PB N="112" REF="013977_0008_0F925A51C3316200">your Maje&s;ty's dominions in America; dutiful petitions for redre&s;s of tho&s;e grievances, from all your Maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects, have been fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>To fill up the mea&s;ure of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, an army has been &s;ent to enforce them.</P>
<P>Superadded to this, mea&s;ures are now planned upon the mo&s;t mercile&s;s policy of &s;tarving our fellow &s;ubjects into a total &s;urrender of their liberties, and an unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to arbitrary government.</P>
<P>The&s;e grievances have driven your Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ub|jects to de&s;pair, and compelled them to have recour&s;e to that re&s;i&s;tance which is ju&s;tified by the great principles of the con&s;ti|tution, actuated by which, at the glorious period of the revo|lution, our ance&s;tors transferred the impartial crown of the&s;e realms from the Popi&s;h and tyrannic race of the Stuarts, to the illu&s;trious and Prote&s;tant Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>Your petitioners are per&s;uaded, that the&s;e mea&s;ures origi|nate in the &s;ecret advice of men who are enemies equally to your Maje&s;ty's title, and to the liberties of your people. That your Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters carry them into execution by the &s;ame fatal corruption which has enabled them to wound the peace and violate the con&s;titution of this country; thus they poi&s;on the fountain of public &s;ecurity, and render that body, which &s;hould be the guardian of liberty, a formidable in&s;trument of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>Your petitioners do therefore mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to di&s;mi&s;s immediately, and forever, from your coun|cils, tho&s;e mini&s;ters and advi&s;ers, as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a full redre&s;s of tho&s;e grievances which alarm and afflict your whole people. So &s;hall peace and commerce be re&s;tored, and the confidence and affection of all your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects be the &s;olid &s;upporters of your throne."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The KING's ANSWER, which would do honor to any butcher, mon&s;ter, or tyrant on earth.</HEAD>
<P>"It is with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment that I find any of my &s;ubjects capable of encouraging the rebellious di&s;po&s;ition, which unhappily exi&s;ts in &s;ome of my Colonies in North-America.</P>
<P>Having entire confidence in the wi&s;dom of my Parliament, the great council of the nation, I will &s;teadily pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they have recommended for the &s;upport of the con&s;titutional rights of Great-Britain, and the protection of the commercial intere&s;ts of my kingdoms.</P>
