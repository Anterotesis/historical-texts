<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"IF there is joy in the pre&s;ence of the angels of GOD, over one &s;inner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons, who need no repentance;"&mdash;and "if the SON of MAN came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance," certainly it is the incumbent duty of tho&s;e to whom he hath committed the "DOC|TRINE of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins," and "recon|ciliation to GOD," not only to "go through the cities and villages," preaching PEACE by JESUS CHRIST;" but al&s;o, to "vi|&s;it the pri&s;on-hou&s;e," even the dungeon, and to communicate the "glad tidings of &s;alvation" to tho&s;e "who &s;it under the &s;ha|dow of death."</P>
<P>To turn &s;uch "as are fa&s;t bound in af|fliction and iron, from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD, that they may have a portion among tho&s;e who are &s;anctified through the blood of Je&s;us, is the de&s;ign of the following manual, in con|junction with the morning and evening, and other holy offices of the church.</P>
<P>Though there is in the hands of the pub|lic, a great variety of devotional tracts, yet
<PB N="ii" REF="023776_0003_0FC1239C7570B1D0">few or none of them (&s;o far as the author knows) are profe&s;&s;edly written for un|fortunate victims of ju&s;tice: therefore, to render the matter and the manner of the following devotions, unexceptionable in the eyes of Chri&s;tians, and promotive of faith and repentance in convicts, they are written after the manner of the antient liturgies; and the matter is principally &s;e|lected from the word of GOD.</P>
<P>N. B. As the following devotions are mo&s;t likely to fall into the hands of the benevolent and humane, "who weep with tho&s;e that weep, and mourn with tho&s;e that mourn;" the author has to reque&s;t their candor for any inaccuracies they may di&s;cover, either in the compo&s;ition or printing, as they were carried directly from the pen to the pre&s;s; in order that, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, they might be put into the hands of <HI>James Williams</HI> and <HI>Thomas Mount,</HI> now lying under &s;en|tence of death in the gaol of Newport.</P>

<P>Ye who are dead to the law, and under the &s;entence of condemnation, li&s;ten to the voice of your gracious and compa&s;|&s;ionate GOD calling you to repentance, in order that ye may find mercy in the day of judgment.

<PB N="2" REF="023776_0004_0FC1239DA72BD118">broken and a contrite heart, O GOD, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e.

Ye &s;hall remember your ways, and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled; and ye &s;hall loathe your&s;elves in your own &s;ight, for all your evils that ye have com|mitted. If ye confe&s;s your &s;ins, GOD is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive you your &s;ins, and to clean&s;e you from all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s.

The hills melted like wax at the pre&s;ence of the Lord; at the pre&s;ence of the Lord of the whole earth. He put on the garments of vengeance for cloth|ing, and was clad with zeal, as a cloak. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay&mdash;fury to his adver&s;aries, and recompence to his enemies. And none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what do&s;t thou.
