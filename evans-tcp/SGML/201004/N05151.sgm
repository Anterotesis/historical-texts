<HEAD>An INQUIRY into the Con&s;equences, OF BOTH <HI>Calvini&s;tic,</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles, compared together. In a Letter to LIBERIUS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had an Opportunity to read your Letter, which (you &s;ay,) you &s;hould have directed to my Brother, if he had been living; but is now directed to me. You mention many bad Con&s;equences, which you &s;uppo&s;e are deducible from our Doctrines; e&s;pecially concerning God's Decrees. But in Or|der to know whether the&s;e Con&s;equences are ju&s;t, or whether they are peculiar to our Principles, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, that the Ca&s;e be fairly &s;tated. I &s;hall therefore pre&s;ent you with a Scheme, of the Principles of each Party; in as plain and as undi&s;gui&s;ed a Manner as I can. But here I would premi&s;e, there are two general Principles, which both Parties are agreed in; that may help us very much in our Inquiry into the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Principles in which we differ. <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That God never acts <HI>inadvertently,</HI> without any Purpo&s;e or De&s;ign, and therefore whatever God does, he certainly decreed to do. And, 2. That the Sovereignty of God, is not <HI>(alogon)</HI> an <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> Dominion; and therefore his Decrees are agreeable to all the Per|fections of an infinitely perfect Being. Having premi&s;ed this; I &s;hall place the <HI>Principles,</HI> in which we differ, in two oppo&s;ite Columns, that they may be the more ea&s;ily compar'd together.</P>

<P>This, I &s;uppo&s;e, you'll allow to be a fair Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Prin|ciples</HI> of each Party. And I am now prepared to confider the <HI>Con&s;e|quences,</HI> which you think do follow from our <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> Principles. And,</P>
<P N="1">1 <Q>The fir&s;t Con&s;equence (you &s;ay, p. 2.) I &s;hall take Notice of as deducible from <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> Principles, is that vulgar one: <HI>viz.</HI> If I am <HI>elected,</HI> I am under an ab&s;olute, inevitable <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> ante|cedent to my Conver&s;ion to Faith and Holine&s;s, of being <HI>&s;aved:</HI> But if I am <HI>not</HI> elected, I am under an ab&s;olute <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> antecedent to any actual Guilt, of being <HI>damned.</HI> Here let us con&s;ider, 1. with Re&s;pect to the Elect, there is an in&s;eparable Concatenation of Cau|&s;es; from the eternal Decree, to their final Salvation. If their eternal Salvation is eternally Decreed, all the Means, and &s;teps in Order to it are decreed likewi&s;e. As the fir&s;t Link of a Chain put in Motion, influences and moves all the intermediate Links; &s;o the primary Decree, influences all the intermediate Cau&s;es, Means, and Steps to the final Event.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which I ob&s;erve, that your whole Argument turns on this Principle; that God's Decrees, do nece&s;&s;arily influence the decreed Event. This Principle, you intimate (p. 5.) you have proved to be true, by &s;trict Demon&s;tration. And thus Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> (upon the five Points; p. 475.) <Q>The Fore-knowledge of any Action, that would otherwi&s;e be free, cannot alter, or dimini&s;h that Freedom, whereas
<PB N="9" REF="006483_0008_10290DAEFA933958">God's Decree of Election is powerful, and active, and comprehends the Preparation, and Exhibition of &s;uch Means; as &s;hall unfru&s;tra|bly produce the End. And his Decree of Reprobation is active, as far as Action is required, to render any Man deficient, and there|fore &s;inful of Nece&s;&s;ity.</Q> And Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> delivers his Sentiments in the &s;ame Words, with the Addition of &s;ome very odd Expre&s;&s;ions. (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Reply p. 76.) <Q>Whereas God's Decree of Election, (is his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> concerning the Event;) it is powerful, and active, &amp;c. And his Decree of Reprobation; (is his Will and Plea&s;ure,) it is active, as far as Action is required to make a Man deficient, and therefore &s;inful of Nece&s;&s;ity.</Q> And all Arminian Writers that I have been acquainted with, &s;ay there is this Difference between God's Fore|knowledge, and his Decrees, that God's Fore knowledge has no In|fluence upon the Thing fore known; whereas it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that God's Decrees do influence the Thing decreed. Almo&s;t all Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s long String of Con&s;equences (1&s;t Reply p. 62&punc; 63, 64, 65, 66.) are founded upon this Principle, that God's Decrees do influence the Event. If this be true, I mu&s;t acknowlege his Con&s;equences are ju&s;t, and his Arguments from God's Decrees, are unan&s;werable. And to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Defence of <HI>Ari&s;tocles,</HI> p. 12, 13. But after all it is a fatal Mi&s;take. And the Rea&s;on that they have been le&s;t to &s;uch a <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ion,</HI> (as far as I can under&s;tand it;) is their ill-natur'd Zeal to charge bad <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> upon the Principles of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> which are evidently founded upon the plain D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">a|tions of the Word of God. But we &s;hall &s;ee, whether while you have been digging a Pit for your Neighbours, you have not fallen into it your &s;elves.</P>
<P>A very Child in the Knowledge of Divinity, who is unprejudiced, could have told you that <HI>Praede&s;tinatio nihil ponit in praede&s;tinato.</HI> The Decrees of God are immanent, and not tran&s;ient Acts, in the divine Mind. Until God reveals his Decrees, they are known <HI>to no Man: no not to the Angels that are in Heaven, nor to Chri&s;t him&s;elf as he is Man, but to the Father only.</HI> What are God's Decrees, but his Purpo&s;e to act or &s;u&s;pend acting; when, and where, and how, he in his in|finite Wi&s;dom &s;ees &s;it? Now does our Purpo&s;e to do any Thing give Birth to the Event, which is brought to pa&s;s by us? No, it is only our acting according to our Purpo&s;e, that has any kind of Influence, in producing the Event. 'Tis true, God does influence every good Event, according to his Decrees. <HI>'Tis in him that we live, and move, and have our Beings: And it is God that works in us that which it well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.</HI> But how does he work in us? By his De|crees! No, but by his Spirit, and Grace. But you'll object, May not
<PB N="10" REF="006483_0009_10290DF38C23E518">the Decrees of God be con&s;idered as the Cau&s;e, or Motive, why God acts or &s;u&s;pends acting? And if &s;o, <Q>then as the fir&s;t Link of a Chain put in Motion, influences and moves all the intermediate Links; &s;o the primary Decree influences all the intermediate Cau&s;es, Means, and Steps, to the final Event?</Q> I an&s;wer, No, God never does any Thing becau&s;e he has decreed to do it. The Rea&s;on why God has decreed to do any thing, is, becau&s;e it a agreeable to his infinite Per|fections to do &s;o. It is beyond our Capacity many Times, to know the Rea&s;on of the divine Conduct: But it is certain, God does not Act in an unrea&s;onable Manner. Wilful and unrea&s;onable Men &s;ome|times, do Things for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they have deter|mined to do them; and that is for no Rea&s;on at all. But God for|bid, that we &s;hould attribute Folly to our Maker; by imagining, that he will do Things meerly becau&s;e he will do them. See <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 33. <HI>O the depth of the Riches, both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God!</HI></P>
<P>But you &s;ay (P. 5.) <Q>Per&s;ons &s;triving after Salvation, does not render it at all more likely that they &s;hall obtain it, than their being for the pre&s;ent utterly carele&s;s and negligent:</Q> And a great deal more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. But there is ju&s;t thus much in all that you argue upon this Head; that &s;ince it is <HI>God who works in you both to will, and to do, according to his own good Plea&s;ure;</HI> i. e. accord|ing to his Decrees; therefore you will not <HI>work out your own Salva|tion with Fear, and Trembling.</HI> God has decreed to never work Faith and Holine&s;s in you, before you are brought to &s;ee the need of it, and to earne&s;tly &s;eek it, and therefore you need not be concerned about it, &s;ince it is God who mu&s;t work in you according to his De|crees, if ever you are &s;aved; therefore if you are elected, God's De|crees will &s;ave you, whether he works in you or not.</P>
<P>But you &s;ugge&s;t, <Q>There is a nece&s;&s;ary Connection between the primary Decree, and the Event.</Q> I an&s;wer, there is none at all, any more than between God's Fore-knowledge, and the Thing fore|known, In a Word, all that can be argued from our Principles con|cerning Election, is no more than this; <HI>viz.</HI> that if God does not ac|cording to his Purpo&s;e and De&s;ign, work Grace and Holine&s;s in us, we never &s;hall be &s;aved: for God can't qualify us for Heaven with|out determining to do it. Upon the whole then, if you are elected, God's Decree will do nothing at all to fit you for Heaven. And therefore unle&s;s you are <HI>made meet for an Inheritance among the Saints in Light,</HI> by the Spirit of Holine&s;s, you mu&s;t lye down in Sorrow.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall con&s;ider your Con&s;equences, with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Non-Elect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006483_0010_10290DB0B31CCB08">
<Q>If I am not elected, (you &s;ay,) I am under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity, antecedent to my actual Guilt, of being damned.</Q> And ac|cordingly your argue (P. 3.) <Q>That God decreed (according to us,) that the Guilt of our fir&s;t Parents Sin &s;hould be imputed to their Po&s;terity; and that an intire and univer&s;al Depravity of Nature &s;hould be brought upon them as the Puni&s;hment of their imputed Guilt. So far then the Decree has a direct Influence and Effici|ency to the putting Mankind into a &s;tate of Sin, and the Non Elect into an irrecoverable State, both of Sin and Damnation. And moreover, &s;ince that actual &s;infulne&s;s of Heart and Life, which in|crea&s;es the Damnation of tho&s;e that peri&s;h, is the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence of this original Depravity; there is upon the whole, as evi|dent, in&s;eparable, and nece&s;&s;ary a Concatenation of Cau&s;es, from the primary Decree to the final Damnation of the Non-Elect, as between the Decree and the final Salvation of the Elect.</Q></P>
<P>But I an&s;wer, it is impo&s;&s;ible that this Con&s;equence can follow from our Principles concerning God's Decrees; becau&s;e we don't be|lieve, there are any Decrees, that have any manner of Efficiency in producing any Event at all; much le&s;s any &s;inful Event. However, let us &s;ee whether this Con&s;equence won't naturally, and directly, follow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> your own Principles. The <HI>Arminians</HI> all believe, that God does &s;end the Non-Elect into the World involved in Sin and Mi&s;ery; (which I &s;hall make appear under another Head.) They believe, that God leaves them to innumerable &s;trong Tempta|tions; and that he permits them to live according to their ungodly Lu&s;ts, and to die impenitent; and that he will puni&s;h them eternally for their Sins. Now you mu&s;t own, unle&s;s you would bla&s;pheme the God who is above, that God never does any Thing without Coun&s;el and De&s;ign, and therefore whatever God does, he certainly decreed to do. This Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> obe&s;erves, (Defence of <HI>Ari&s;tocles,</HI> p. 21) <Q>The right Way of judging of God's Decrees, is by Facts before our Eyes &mdash; For what God does, he doubtle&s;s decreed to do.</Q></P>
<P>If therefore God does &s;end the Non-Elect into the World in a &s;inful and mi&s;erable State, and does permit them to live in Sin, <HI>and trea&s;ure up Wrath, again&s;t the Day of Wrath;</HI> you mu&s;t believe, that God has decreed to do &s;o. Now then if the Decrees of God have a direct In|fluence and Efficiency in producing the Event (as you &s;ay they have;) the Con&s;equence does nece&s;&s;arily follow, that if your are not elected, you are under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, antecedent to any actual Guilt, of being Damned. Thus, Sir, you have rai&s;ed a mi&s;chievous and frightful Apparition, which will haunt you Day, and Night, unle&s;s you can lay it, by reading backwards.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006483_0011_10290DF6E3656E90">
But you argue, <Q>If the Guilt of our fir&s;t Parents Sin &s;hould be imputed to their Po&s;terity, and that an intire, and univer&s;al Depra|vity of Nature &s;hould be brought upon them as a Puni&s;hment of this imputed Guilt, &mdash; then the Decree has a direct Influence and Efficiency in putting the Non Elect into an irrecoverable &s;tate of Sin and Damnation.</Q> But pray Sir, how will it help the Ca&s;e of the Non-Elect, though it be &s;uppo&s;ed that God decreed to bring them into the World with an intire and univer&s;al Depravity of Nature, not as a Puni&s;hment for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, but for &s;ome other unknown Rea&s;on? &mdash; Why has not this Decree as direct and Influence and Efficiency to put them into a &s;tate of Sin and Damnation as if it was done as a Pu|ni&s;hment for the Sin of their fir&s;t Parents? The <HI>Arminians</HI> acknow|ledge the intire and univer&s;al Depravity of Nature, (as will be further con&s;idered.) And it God decreed to leave them to live and die in Sin, and to puni&s;h them for it; And if this Decree has a nece&s;&s;ary In|fluence and Efficiency in producing the Event; then they are put into an irrecoverable &s;tate of Sin and Damnation, &s;ure enough! But you'll tell me, I conclude, that according to your Principles God has given the Non-Elect <HI>Grace &s;ufficient</HI> to &s;ubdue their Lu&s;ts and overcome all Temptations; &s;o that it is in their own Power to believe, and repent, and obtain Salvation. Neverthele&s;s you had as good &s;ay Nothing: for, &s;uppo&s;ing that Gracele&s;s Men, have Grace &s;ufficient to obtain Sal|vation, yet according to your Principle, that God's Decrees nece&s;&s;arily influence the Event, the eternal State of the Non Elect was fixed, Millions of Ages before they had any Opportunity to exerci&s;e their &s;ufficient Grace. If God decreed to &s;end them into the world in|volved in Sin, and to permit their final Impenitency, and puni&s;h them for it; and it there be <HI>a nece&s;&s;ary Concatenation of Cau&s;es between the primary Decree and the final Event;</HI> then they are in as Remedile&s;s a State, as if they were in the Regions of De&s;pair. Is this (Sir) your rational and charitable Scheme! What a wide Door does your Prin|ciple concerning the Nece&s;&s;itating Influence of God's Decrees &s;et open; <Q><HI>either to De&s;peration, or to Wretchle&s;ne&s;s of mo&s;t unclean Liv|ing, no le&s;s perillous than De&s;peration!</HI></Q></P>

<P N="2">II. "The next general Con&s;equence, (you &s;ay, p. 8.) from our <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> Principles, is, that Chri&s;t and Salvation were never <HI>offered</HI> to the <HI>Non-Elect.</HI> An Offer upon an impo&s;&s;ible Condition is no Offer at all. According to my own Doctrine (you &s;ay,) all the Offer was upon an Impo&s;&s;ible Condition. And hence you argue,

<PB N="13" REF="006483_0012_10290DB411D1EB90">
<ITEM>1. That Chri&s;t did not die for the Non-Elect, any more, or in any other Re&s;pect, than he died for the Devils.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Non-Elect, do not refu&s;e offered Mercy, and Grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They will not be condemned at la&s;t, for having refu&s;ed an offered Saviour."</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Here I ob&s;erve, your Arguments to prove the Con&s;equences, which you mention under this Head, turn upon. two Points, <HI>viz.</HI> I. What you &s;uppo&s;e we believe concerning human <HI>Impotency,</HI> and, 2. From what you think to be our Opinion concerning God's <HI>Decrees.</HI> Accord|ing to us, (you &s;ay, p. 9.) <Q>'Tis as impo&s;&s;ible for Men to convert them&s;elves, as it is for them to create a Word. And it is intirely agreeable with our Doctrine, (you &s;ay,) that the Non-Elect &s;hall never have Grace to convert them.</Q></P>
<P>What concerns your Arguments, taken from our Opinion of human Impotency, will more properly fall under the 4th Head, and &s;hall there be &s;ully con&s;idered. But what I &s;hall now con&s;ider, is the Force of your Arguments, to prove you Con&s;equences taken from our Opinion of God's Decrees; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is impo&s;&s;ible the Non-Elect &s;hould accept of an offered Saviour, becau&s;e God has decreed not to give them Grace to comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel. &mdash; But as we firmly believe, that the Decrees of God have no more Influence or Efficiency in producing any Event, than if there were no Decrees at all; &s;urely this Con&s;equence can never follow from our Principles. But this very Con&s;equence does directly follow from your Doctrine, that God's Decrees do nece&s;&s;arily influence the Event. If I &s;hould a&s;k here, what are the Conditions upon which the Benefits of Chri&s;t's Redemption are offered to the Non Elect? You would tell me, Faith and Repentance: and not that univer&s;al Grace (or Light) which the <HI>Quakers</HI> and you talk of. If I &s;hould enquire again, whether Faith and Repentance be not the <HI>Gift of God? You would an&s;wer, Yes: <HI>It is God who works in us all the good Plea&s;ure of his Grace, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> And if I &s;hould demand once more, whether God does in Fact leave the Non-Elect to die without Faith, and Repentance? You would an&s;wer, yes. Well then, what God does he certainly decreed to do. If therefore God decreed to leave the Non Elect to die without Faith and Repentance; and if there be (as you a&s;&s;ert) a nece&s;&s;ary Concatenation of Cau&s;es between the pri|mary Decree, and the Event decreed, then this Con&s;equence will cer|tainly follow, that Faith in a Redeemer is an impo&s;&s;ible Condition. If
<PB N="14" REF="006483_0013_10290DF8B837EC08">the Non-Elect have it not, and God decreed to not give it, but to let them die without it, and this Decree had a nece&s;&s;ary Efficiency in producing the Event, (as you &s;ay it has; then Chri&s;t never died for the Non-Elect any more than for the fallen Angels. Chri&s;t never was in earne&s;t offered to them (if your Principles are true,) For an Offer upon an impo&s;&s;ible Condition is no Offer at all. The Non-Elect never re|fu&s;e redeeming Mercy, (if God's Decrees influence the Event,) and will never be puni&s;hed for their neglecting the great Salvation! Dear Sir, what mon&s;trous Opinions do you &s;eem to hold! Mu&s;t the God of Truth, be charged with In&s;incerity, in all his conde&s;cending and gracious Offers, Invitations, and Encouragements, rather than you'll part with your unaccountable Doctrine of nece&s;&s;itating Decrees! &mdash; But as <HI>we</HI> believe, there are no &s;uch Decrees;</HI> &s;o we believe, the Terms of Salvation are the &s;ame for all Men, Elect or Non-Elect. <HI>There is but one Faith, one Lord, one Bapti&s;m, one Hope of our Calling. He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved: And be that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding any Influence that the Decrees of God have upon the Non Elect: it is every Whit as ea&s;y for them to accept of an offered Saviour as for the Elect. The&s;e, Sir, The&s;e are our Principles, founded upon all the Declarations of the Go&s;pel. And therefore as Amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, we proclaim and offer to all Men, Elect, or Non-Elect, <HI>Who&s;o will, let him come, and taks of the Waters of Life freely.</HI> &mdash; But</P>
<P>III. <Q>The third general Con&s;equence (you &s;ay p. 11.) is, that the <HI>Impenitence</HI> of the <HI>Non-Elect,</HI> or their not complying with the Go&s;pel-Terms of Salvation, is <HI>not their own actual Fault,</HI> but is purely the Effect of <HI>Original Sin.</HI> 'Tis all the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Effect of imputed Guilt; or the Sin of their fir&s;t Parents charged upon them, and puni&s;hed in them; and this in &s;uch a Manner, as to take off all actual Fault and Blame from them. And hence you argue, that they will be puni&s;hed only for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin imputed to them, or propagated in them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, all the Con&s;equences which you mention under this Head, and &s;uppo&s;e to be deducible from our Doctrine of Original Sin, does as much follow from the common Belief of every Sect of Men calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; whether <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> (the <HI>Socinians</HI> only excepted.) The Doctrine of original Sin has been received, and defended in the Chri&s;tian Church, in all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ages of it. In the council of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> (Anno 415.) the Opinion of <HI>Pelagius</HI> and his Adherents who denied Original Sin, was condemned as a grievous Here&s;y. The Opinion of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> with Re&s;pect to this
<PB N="15" REF="006483_0014_10290DBA2D04EED0">Doctrine, may be known by the Decrees of the Council of <HI>Trent:</HI> By which they pronounce an Anathema, (1.) <Q>Again&s;t him which confe&s;&s;eth not, that <HI>Adam</HI> by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing hath lo&s;t Sanctity and Ju&s;tice, incurred the Wrath of God, Death, and Thraldom to the Devil: And is infected in Soul, and Body. (2.) Again&s;t him which averreth that <HI>Adam</HI> by &s;inning, hath hurt him&s;elf only, or hath de|rived unto his Po&s;terity the Death only of the Body, and not Sin, the Death of the Soul. (3.) Again&s;t him which affirmeth, that Sin, which is one in the Beginning, and proper to every one, tran&s;mitted by Generation, not Imitation, can be aboli&s;hed by any other Remedy than the Death of Chri&s;t.</Q> (See <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> p. 184.) &mdash; The general Opinion of all <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> may be known, by the <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion; which Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> &s;ays, <Q>his own Con|&s;cience tells him he heartily believes,</Q> 2d Reply p. 37. In which (be&s;ides what my Brother cited,) we have the&s;e Words, and more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. <Q>We mean by <HI>Original Sin;</HI> that which the holy Fathers, and all of &s;ound Judgment in the Church, do &s;o call; namely, that <HI>Guilt</HI> whereby all that come into the World, are through <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, &s;ubject to God's Wrath, and eternal Death: And that very <HI>Corruption</HI> of Man's Nature derived from <HI>Adam.</HI> And this Corruption of Man's Nature, comprehendeth both the Defect of original Ju&s;tice, Integrity, and Obedience, and al&s;o Con|cupi&s;cence&mdash; Wherefore the&s;e Defects, and this Concupi&s;cence, are Things Damnable, and of their own Nature worthy of Death.</Q> (<HI>Harm.</HI> of Confe&s;&s;. p. 73.) &mdash; And the <HI>Arminians</HI> profe&s;s, that they believe the intire and univer&s;al Depravity of human Nature, as much as we do. If you charge the <HI>Arminians</HI> with denying Original Sin; Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> (who&s;e Principles you have undertaken to defend,) will tell you; It is an horrid Slander. My Brother having &s;tated the Doctrine of Original Sin, in as &s;trong Terms as any <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> believe it; Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> &s;ays, (2d Reply p. 26.) <Q>I won't &s;ay, I <HI>believe</HI> this, but I <HI>know</HI> it by Experience, and though Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> has accu&s;ed me of denying Original Sin; yet, for ought I can learn from the&s;e two Books, I believe Original Sin in a more <HI>rigid</HI> Sen&s;e than he did.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Arminians</HI> have ('tis true) a different Way of explaining this Doctrine, (which I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider;) but yet if they don't really believe it, we mu&s;t think them &s;ome of the mo&s;t aban|doned Men in the World. <HI>Arminius</HI> him&s;elf, and all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Di|vines that followed him (as far as I am acquainted with the Ca&s;e) did all profe&s;s their Belief of it. And the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> among which are many in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Way of thinking, do all of them make the mo&s;t publick and &s;olemn Profe&s;&s;ion of their Belief of
<PB N="16" REF="006483_0015_10290DFD312AF1D0">this Doctrine; and in as &s;trong Terms as any <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> can do. If you tell me, that they &s;ay a great many Things again&s;t it, and endeavour to draw a great many bad Con&s;equences from it, and charge them upon the <HI>Calvini&s;ts;</HI> I can't help that, I am not accountable for their Incon&s;i&s;tences. But if you think, they be not &s;incere (in their Profe&s;&s;ion) you ought to look upon it, not only as a &s;ad In&s;tance of the Depravity of human Nature; but likewi&s;e of the bad Influence of <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles. In the 9th <HI>Article</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they profe&s;s they believe; <Q>Original Sin &s;tandeth not in the follow|ing of <HI>Adam,</HI> as the <HI>Pelagians</HI> vainly talk: But it is the Fault, and Corruption, of the Nature of every Man, that naturally is ingendered of the Off &s;pring of <HI>Adam;</HI> whereby Man is very far gone from original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil. &mdash; And therefore in every Per&s;on, born into this World, it de&s;erveth God's Wrath and Damnation &mdash; And that Concupi|&s;cence, and Lu&s;t hath of it&s;elf the Nature of Sin.</Q> And they pro|fe&s;s they believe, that &s;uch is the intire, and univer&s;al Depravity of Nature, that we have no Power naturally to do that which is Good. As in <HI>Art.</HI> 10, <Q>The Condition of Man &s;ince the Fall is &s;uch, &mdash; We have no Power to do good Works, plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Chri&s;t preventing us; that we may have a good Will, and Working with us, when we have that good Will</Q> And not only &s;o, but they have &s;uch an Opinion of the dreadful State of Sin and Wickedne&s;s, all Men are naturally in; that they profe&s;s they believe, All Works done by Men before they are truly ju&s;tified, by the Grace of Chri&s;t, &mdash; are &s;o far from being plea&s;ing to God, that they have the Nature of Sin. <HI>Art.</HI> 13. Where then is the Propriety of charging Con&s;equences upon our <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> Doctrine of Original Sin, as though it was peculiar to us, when in Fact the <HI>Arminians</HI> profe&s;s they believe it in as &s;trong Terms as we do? And indeed the intire and univer&s;al Depravity of human Nature, is what has been complained of in all Ages, and in all Places, not only by the Chri&s;tians, and Jews, but by the very Heathens them&s;elves. <HI>The whole World lies in Wickedne&s;s,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding what you talk, of their having Grace &s;ufficient for Salvation:) And the original Fountain, from whence &s;prings all that Flood of Wickedne&s;s, that covers the whole Face of the Earth, is their natural Corruption. &mdash; You don't ex|pect, that I &s;hould now undertake to &s;how the Ju&s;tice, and Equity of God's puni&s;hing us for the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents: Or to prove from the Word of <HI>God, that both Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin, and by Nature Children of Wrath; being &s;hapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin; which entered into the World by one Man, of whom all have &s;inned.</HI> The Way and Manner how Sin came to be propagated, is not the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="17" REF="006483_0016_10290DBBB77D17E8">Que&s;tion. But that Mankind are naturally in a &s;inful, and depra|ved State, is granted by all Chri&s;tians: (for I don't think the <HI>Socinians</HI> de&s;erve that Name.) But whether this will excu&s;e Men in their con|tinuing impenitent, and &s;o living, and dying in a Cour&s;e of Rebellion again&s;t God; I &s;hall con&s;ider under the following Head.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <Q>The next general Con&s;equence, which you &s;hall take Notice of, (you &s;ay p. 20.) as flowing from our Doctrine, is, that the <HI>Non-Elect</HI> were never in a State of <HI>Probation.</HI> They never had a Time of Tryal; whether they would comply with the Terms of Salva|tion, or not: For antecedent to their being capable Subjects of &s;uch a Tryal, they were laid under an Impo&s;&s;ibility of ever being willing to comply.</Q></P>
<P>I ob&s;erve here, all your Arguments under this Head turn upon what you take to be our Opinion concerning God's Decrees, and our Opi|nion concerning human Impotency. So far as this Con&s;equence re|&s;pects the Decrees of God; I have to &s;ay, this very Con&s;equence does certainly follow from your Opinion, that God's Decrees do nece&s;&s;arily influence the Event. Upon your own Principles, <Q>the Non-Elect have no time of Tryal, any more than the fallen Angels, and are no more to blame than if they had no Time of Probation:</Q> For if God decreed to do what he certainly does do) leave them to live and die in Sin, and if there be a nece&s;&s;ary Concatenation of Cau&s;es, between the Decree, and final Event, (as you &s;ay there is;) what time of Tryal can they have? What mu&s;t they try to do? Overturn the Pillars of Heaven! And change an Event that is fixed by an Almighty Decree! But as I ob&s;erved before, with Re&s;pect to your other Con&s;equences, &s;o I &s;ay now; this Con&s;equence can't in any Re&s;pect follow from our Opinion concerning the Decrees; becau&s;e we do not believe there are any Decrees, that have any manner of Influence, in putting Man|kind into a State of natural Blindne&s;s and Hardne&s;s of Heart; or to render them in any Re&s;pect uncapable to comply with the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall examine your Arguments, to prove that the Con&s;equence you mention, does follow from our Opinion of our natural Inability to believe and repent. We do believe (as you ob&s;erve,) that Men are as unable to convert them&s;elves, without the &s;pecial Influences of God's holy Spirit, as to make a new World. But only there is this Differ|ence: in one Ca&s;e there is a natural Impo&s;&s;ibility, and in the other only a Moral. <Q>But (you &s;ay p. 23.) what would you think of a Sy&s;tem of Religion built upon &s;uch an Hypothe&s;is? Suppo&s;e you were conveyed to another Race of fallen Creatures, and you &s;hould
<PB N="18" REF="006483_0017_10290E0040C12938">hear one of the Preachers addre&s;&s;ing the People in this Manner; O fallen Creatures, fallen through the Imputation of your fir&s;t Parents Sin! You are reduced to a mi&s;erable Condition; you are expo&s;ed to Puni&s;hment here, and to a greater hereafter: But now I propo&s;e it to you, that if you will but only create a new World, you &s;hall be freed from this Mi&s;ery, and obtain Happine&s;s. You have a Time of Probation allowed you, you have an Opportunity in your Hands of making Tryal. If you let &s;lip this Opportunity, you are infinitely to blame, and will be mi&s;erable for ever, with this aggra|vating Circum&s;tance, that you refu&s;ed Happine&s;s, when offered to you upon the rea&s;onable Terms of making a World.</Q> You inquire, what I think of &s;uch an Offer? I an&s;wer, &s;uppo&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ed God had given them &s;ufficient Encouragement, that upon their u&s;ing &s;uitable Endeavours to make a new World, he would exert a divine Power to enable them to do it; and &s;uppo&s;ing he had appointed Means that would never fail of being Effectual, if they were not abu&s;ed; &s;up|po&s;ing al&s;o that many of them upon u&s;ing the appointed Means, had actually been enabled to do it; I would &s;ay, they were &s;elf-con|demned, if they did not do it; but would peri&s;h when &s;o rea&s;onable an Offer was made to them. If God had told <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that he and all the People would certainly peri&s;h by the Hands of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> if he did not comply with the rea&s;onable Condition of &s;tretching forth his Rod, and dividing the red Sea: What if <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had an&s;wered, "The Condition of our Deliverance is an impo&s;&s;ible Condition; and an Offer made upon &s;uch a Condition, is no Offer at all. The Sea is a Mile wide, and there is a va&s;t Body of Waters; I can't &s;top the lea&s;t Brook, without a great deal of Pains, and Labour. But &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al as this, was never made to any Man before, &s;ince the World began; and I am as able to make a new World as to do it. This is only to in&s;ult and tantalize us in our Mi&s;ery, and Danger." Would <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> have done well, to argue after this Manner; and &s;o neglect the Means by which this Event was to be accompli&s;hed? And &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; though Men are under an utter moral Impo&s;&s;ibility to convert them&s;elves; yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible for them to u&s;e the Means, which God has appointed. And as my Brother ob&s;erves in the Pa&s;&s;age cited by you, (1&s;t <HI>Vind.</HI> p. 39.) <Q>Don't <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Di|vines unitedly agree that God has given common Grace to tho&s;e to whom he has not given his &s;pecial and &s;overeign Influences? Is it not univer&s;ally allowed, that by Virtue of this common Grace, they have a Power to ab&s;tain from open Scandal, to perform the ex|ternal Duties of Religion; to take Pains with their own Hearts to get them in a proper Frame for Duty; and thereby to excite in them&s;elves, &s;ome Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Earne&s;tne&s;s, and Diligence; to con|&s;ider
<PB N="19" REF="006483_0018_10290DC2BA4E0298">of their own Impotency, and continue to lie at the Foot-&s;tool of Divine Grace, for all &s;upplies of Grace and Strength for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t the Mediator and Redeemer? Is it not univer&s;ally allowed, that if this be their Temper and Conduct, they have &s;ufficient En|couragement given them in the Go&s;pel, to hope that they may ob|tain the &s;pecial and &s;aving Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.</Q> And I may here further add, that it is (as far as I know,) univer&s;ally allowed, that the Means (internal and external,) which God is u&s;ing with Sin|ners, (at lea&s;t under the Go&s;pel;) would never fail of being effectual, unle&s;s they abu&s;e them. 'Tis true, God did not elect Men to Holi|ne&s;s, becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, they would in any Mea&s;ure de&s;erve it before their Conver&s;ion. Nor do we think, God has obliged him&s;elf, by any Promi&s;e made to unconverted Sinners, that he will convert them, upon the Condition of &s;ome Endeavours of their own, before Conver&s;ion. And it is in Mercy to poor Sinners, that he has not done it. But yet it is manife&s;t to me, that when Per&s;ons are truly concerned about their Sin and Danger, and earne&s;tly &s;eeking an Intere&s;t in the great Salva|tion, they have greater Encouragement given them in the Go&s;pel, than if God had made &s;ome certain Promi&s;es to them; &s;u&s;pended upon the Condition of &s;ome Doings of their own. But you'll inquire, agree|able to your Di&s;cour&s;e (p. 21.) <Q>Did none of the <HI>Non-Elect,</HI> never do what might be rea&s;onably expected of Men in their Circum&s;tan|ces?</Q> I an&s;wer; No, never. But you inquire again, <HI>(ibid.)</HI> <Q>What if the Non-Elect and done all this, what would have been the Event?</Q> I an&s;wer, ab&s;urd Suppo&s;itions admit of ab&s;urd Con&s;equen|ces. If they had not abu&s;ed the Means of Grace, but had done what God might rea&s;onably expect of them, they would not have been <HI>Non-Elect.</HI> But you &s;ay, (p. 24.) <Q>That we in&s;i&s;t upon it, that it is not Men's doing what they can, that is the Terms of Salvation; but their being willing to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t, which they cannot do.</Q>&mdash; I grant it. But the Means mu&s;t be u&s;ed in order to the End. And although it is morally impo&s;&s;ible, that we &s;hould, without the &s;pecial Influences of divine Grace, comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel; yet with the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances it is by no Means impo&s;&s;ible. And &s;ince a divine Ble&s;&s;ing would accompany the Means, unle&s;s Men hinder their Efficacy, by their own Sloth, Wickedne&s;s or Stubbornne&s;s; &s;urely they have no Rea&s;on to complain; <HI>If our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them; how &s;hall we then live?</HI> Surely &s;ince this is the Ca&s;e, our natural Impotency to comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel, will in no Mea&s;ure, excu&s;e our Neglect of the great Salvation. And according to our Scheme Men will not (as Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> and you imagine) have any Thing to plead in the Place of Darkne&s;s, that their Mi&s;ery was not <HI>of them&s;elves:</HI> That they had no Time of
<PB N="20" REF="006483_0019_10290E033A9D9D80">Tryal; becau&s;e the Condition of their Salvation was an impo&s;&s;ible Condition. And I believe my Brother's Rea&s;oning is well founded; and exactly agreeable to our Principles in the Pa&s;&s;age which you cite. (p. 25.) <Q>What I will Sinners be perfectly ea&s;y in their Con&s;ciences in the Regions of eternal De&s;pair; when they come to reflect, that Chri&s;t wrought out a &s;ufficient Redemption for them; exhibited him&s;elf, and freely offer'd his &s;aving Benefits in the Go&s;pel to 'em; but they wilfully rejected both him, and them! And when they re|flect, that God had u&s;ed all proper Means with them for their Salvation; made known their Duty, and the Way of Salvation to them; laid all proper Motives before them, by the Di&s;covery of their Need of Salvation, by Threatnings, and Warnings, by Pro|mi&s;es, and Invitations, that he might excite both their Hopes and Fears: &s;ent them his Amba&s;&s;adors to be&s;eech them to be recon|ciled to God; excited them to con&s;ider, and turn to God, by the common Motions of his Holy Spirit, and long exerci&s;ed Patience and Forbearance towards them, in the U&s;e of all the&s;e Me|thods, and Means of Grace: And after all, they rejected, abu&s;ed, and &s;inned away all the&s;e Advantages, from no other Nece&s;&s;ity than the Indulgence of their Lu&s;ts, and the Perver&s;ene&s;s of their Wills, and finally peri&s;hed, becau&s;e they <HI>would not come unto Chri&s;t they might have Life!</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible, Con&s;cience can be perfectly ea&s;y under the&s;e Reflections, when awakened by Hell-Fire! &s;urely, Sinners will have another View of Things in the Regions of De&s;pair, than is pretended by Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e. Their Con&s;ciences will not allow them to argue, as this Gentleman now &s;eems to do; that they were excu&s;able in not improving what Power, and Grace they had, becau&s;e Chri&s;t had not purcha&s;ed greater Bene|fits, or had not be&s;towed the &s;ame upon them, as upon &s;ome others.</Q> Such a Di&s;cour&s;e (you &s;ay p. 26.) con&s;idered by it &s;elf is affecting in|deed! And all that you are &s;orry for, is, that the Doctrine which he and I are defending, intirely undermines &s;uch moving Methods of Addre&s;s. But pray, Sir, what Doctrine? Not our Doctrine of the Decrees as I have proved before: Nor yet our Doctrine of human Impotency; For certainly our not being able to do every Thing, will not excu&s;e us in doing nothing. And &s;ince a divine Influence would accompany the Means of Grace, if improved as they ought to be, to enable us <HI>both to will and do,</HI> can we be excu&s;able if we neglect <HI>work|ing out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling?</HI> The Hu&s;bandman can't make his Crain &s;prout and &s;pring up, when it is ca&s;t into the Ground, any more than he can make a new World: but yet this will not excu&s;e his Negligence, in not breaking up his fallow Ground, and &s;owing his Seed.</P>

But you &s;ay,</P>
<P N="5">V. <Q>Our Doctrine intirely overthrows the Notion of Man's being a <HI>free,</HI> or <HI>moral Agent.</HI> You confe&s;s Indeed (you &s;ay,) that our Principles admit of what Writers call &s;pontaneous or voluntary Freedom; which &s;ignifies nothing more, than that, when a Man chu&s;es any Object, or Cour&s;e of Life, this Choice is the Act of the Will. The Mind is willing without any Con&s;ideration, whether he can chu&s;e any other Object, or Cour&s;e of Life. Thus when a Per&s;on chu&s;es to pur&s;ue a Life of Virtue, or a Life of Vice, this Choice is the Act of the Will; the Per&s;on acts voluntarily, in the Matter, although it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for him to chu&s;e the con|trary. Such a voluntary Freedom as this, is all the <HI>Liberty</HI> which our Principles (you &s;ay) allow to Mankind. But if this be all the Liberty which in Reality they have; the rigid Doctrine of <HI>Fatality</HI> admits of as much. And indeed as much as this, is attributed to Bruits, as well as Men. But it is Liberty of <HI>Choice,</HI> or <HI>Indifference,</HI> that con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ential and di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of a free, rational, and accountable Creature. And this &s;ort of Liberty, as the very learned and ingenious Dr. WATTS ob&s;erves, implies a Power to chu&s;e, or refu&s;e; to chu&s;e one Thing, or the contrary, among &s;everal Things that are propo&s;ed, without any inward or outward Re&s;traint, Force, or con&s;training Bya&s;s or Influence.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, it appears to me, very ab&s;urd, to &s;ay, that no rational Being can be a <HI>free</HI> Agent; unle&s;s he has a Liberty of <HI>Indifference.</HI> GOD him&s;elf is infinitely free: but can any Chri&s;tian &s;uppo&s;e, that he has &s;uch a Liberty <HI>ad utrumque;</HI> that he can chu&s;e that which is evil?</P>
<P>And thus Dr. CLARKE argues, (<HI>Demon&s;t.</HI> p. 120, 121, 122.) <Q>From hence it follows, that though God is a mo&s;t perfectly free Agent; yet he can't but do always that which is be&s;t, and wi&s;e&s;t, in the whole. The Rea&s;on is evident, becau&s;e perfect Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s, are as &s;teddy, and certain Principles of Action; as Nece&s;&s;ity it &s;elf. And an infinitely wi&s;e, and good Being, endued with the mo&s;t perfect Liberty, can no more choo&s;e to act in Con|tradiction to Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s, than a nece&s;&s;ary Agent can act contrary to the Nece&s;&s;ity, by which it is acted. It being as great an Ab&s;urdity, and Impo&s;&s;ibility in Choice, for infinite Wi&s;dom, to choo&s;e to act unwi&s;ely, or infinite Goodne&s;s, to choo&s;e what is not good; as it would be in Nature, for ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, to fail of producing its nece&s;&s;ary Effect.</Q> &mdash; And how can it be imagined, that the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, and glorified Saints, have a Liberty of In|difference;
<PB N="22" REF="006483_0021_10290E0513707C78">&s;o that they can chu&s;e to be &s;eparated from God, and be &s;ent <HI>into utter Darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth for ever?</HI></P>
<P>And as to the Ca&s;e of Mankind, though I freely grant that in many Ca&s;es Men have a Liberty of Indifference; yet in many others, they have not &s;uch a Liberty <HI>ad utrumvis.</HI> I have not Dr. WATTS'S Book by me, which you take your Citations from; but I don't doubt, he would allow that in many Ca&s;es, our Choice is determined by the Light of our Minds. However, the Que&s;tion is not &s;o much, what was his Opinion, as what is <HI>Truth?</HI> There are innumerable In&s;tances, in which, I find it morally impo&s;&s;ible for me to chu&s;e contrary to the Light of my own Mind. I can't make my&s;elf willing under my pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances, to be expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torments, that ever were inflicted by cruel Tyrants. And a Thou&s;and In&s;tances might be given, in which we have not a Liberty of Indifference. Dr. CLARKE, who was no Fatali&s;t, (unle&s;s an <HI>Arminian</HI> may be a Fatali&s;t,) argues in this Ca&s;e, I think, very ju&s;tly. (<HI>Demon&s;tr.</HI> p. 100.) <Q>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity therefore, by which the Power of acting follows the Judg|ment of the Under&s;tanding, is only a moral Nece&s;&s;ity; that is, no Nece&s;&s;ity at all in the Sen&s;e, wherein the Oppo&s;ers of Liberty un|der&s;tand Nece&s;&s;ity. For moral Nece&s;&s;ity is evidently con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect natural Liberty. For In&s;tance, a Man intirely free from all Pain of Body, and Di&s;order of Mind, judges it unrea|&s;onable for him to hurt, or de&s;troy him&s;elf; and being under no Temptation, or external Violence, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly act contrary to his Judgment: not becau&s;e he wants a natural or phy&s;ical Power, &s;o to do; but becau&s;e it is ab&s;urd, and mi&s;chievous, and morally impo&s;&s;ible for him to chu&s;e to do it. Which al&s;o is the very Rea|&s;on why the mo&s;t perfect rational Creatures &s;uperior to Men, cannot do Evil, not becau&s;e they want a natural Power to perform the material Action; but becau&s;e it is morally impo&s;&s;ible, that with a perfect Knowledge of what is be&s;t, and without any Temptation to Evil, their Will &s;hould determine it &s;elf to chu&s;e to act fooli&s;hly, and unrea&s;onably. Here therefore &s;eems at la&s;t to lie the fundamental Error; both of tho&s;e, who argue again&s;t the Liberty of the Will, and tho&s;e who but too confu&s;edly defend it.</Q> And in Matters of Religion, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, I grant, Men have a Liberty of Indiffer|ence; but in others it is manife&s;t they have not. The very Citations which you take from Dr. WATTS, to prove that we have in all Ca&s;es &s;uch a Liberty, without being influenced, or bya&s;&s;ed by the Light of our Minds, do evidently prove the contrary. <Q>When the Chri&s;tian Revelation is propo&s;ed to a Man, as coming from God;
<PB N="23" REF="006483_0022_10290DC95B1205F0">It becomes Man as a rational Creature, to con&s;ider the Proofs, and Evidences brought to confirm it: The Prophecies, the Miracles, the internal Excellencies, and all external Te&s;timonies that come with it. And it is the Will, that mu&s;t employ the Mind, to dwell upon the&s;e Inquiries, diligently, and faithfully, in proportion to the Merits of the Cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>If it be nece&s;&s;ary that we take &s;o much Pains, that we may &s;ee the Evidence of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, in order to our believing it, then it mu&s;t unavoidably follow, that we can't believe it without &s;eeing the Evidences of its Truth, or even contrary to the Conviction of our own Minds. And I May add, if we have &s;uch a Liberty of Indiffer|ence, that we can believe the Go&s;pel, without &s;eeing the Evidence of its Truth; and even contrary to the Conviction of our own Minds; then we might believe it, if there were no Evidences of its being true: No Prophecies, no Miracles, no internal Excellencies, and no external Te&s;timonies, to incline our Minds to believe the Truth of it. We could (according to your Doctrine;) have believed it, without any Conviction of its being true; and therefore all the Evidences of its Truth are needle&s;s, to Influence our Belief. And what you cite from my Brother, (p. 31.) appears to me to be to the Purpo&s;e. <Q>Suppo&s;e a Sinner, while he could <HI>not receive the Things of the Spirit of God;</HI> but they appeared <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> to him, while his Affections were pla|ced upon his Lu&s;ts, and Plea&s;ures, and the&s;e appeared much the mo&s;t de&s;irable to him; could determine his Will, to the Choice of tho&s;e gracious Habits, and Exerci&s;es, which were his highe&s;t Aver|&s;ion, and in which he could &s;ee nothing de&s;irable, and eligible; would this render him a moral Agent? Would he be a moral Agent, by chu&s;ing not only, without any &s;en&s;ible Motive in View; but even contrary to the Motives he had in View?</Q></P>
<P>But you &s;ay, (<HI>ibid.</HI>) <Q>What is this to the Purpo&s;e; did ever any Body dream of any &s;uch Thing?</Q> I an&s;wer, it is directly to the Purpo&s;e. And all your Di&s;cour&s;e under this Head, is &s;ounded upon &s;uch a Dream. Is not this the very Thing, that you would prove; that a Man is not a free Agent, unle&s;s he has a Liberty of Indifference; &s;o that he can chu&s;e and refu&s;e without being influenced by the Light of his Mind? And don't you argue all along, that we join with the <HI>Fa|tali&s;ts,</HI> becau&s;e we deny that we can in many Ca&s;es, incline our own Wills <HI>ad utrumque,</HI> to chu&s;e one Thing, or the contrary?</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, it is not to the Purpo&s;e; (p. 31.) becau&s;e <Q>the <HI>Arminians</HI> unitedly agree, that God has by the glorious Revelation
<PB N="24" REF="006483_0023_10290E0985D7C210">of his Spirit, &s;et forth in the View of Mankind, the infinite Evil of Sin, and the Divine Amiablene&s;s of Holine&s;s; and that he has given to Men a Power of Con&s;ideration; whereby with the con|&s;tantly concurring Influences of his Holy Spirit, they can freely examine, and bring home to their Minds, the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of Religion; and the Deceit, Evil, and Bitterne&s;s of Sin; and upon &s;uch a View, they have a Power to embrace the one, and refu&s;e the other, by the free Choice of their Wills.</Q> I an&s;wer, if this be indeed the Ca&s;e; if it be nece&s;&s;ary that God by his Spirit, &s;hould di&s;cover to Men the Truth, and Excellency of Religion; and that we mu&s;t examine, and bring home to our Minds this Evi|dence of the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of it, in order to our receiving it; then we have not a Liberty of Indifference, to receive, or reject the Go&s;pel, without being influenced or bya&s;&s;ed by the Evi|dence of Truth, let into our Minds. And I would further ob&s;erve, if it be <HI>Fatali&s;m,</HI> to believe that a Man has not a Liberty of In|difference to believe, and repent, without a glorious Revelation of God's Holy Spirit, to &s;et the infinite evil of Sin, and the divine Amiablene&s;s of Holine&s;s, in &s;uch a Light, at to influence our Choice; then the <HI>Arminians</HI> are as much Fatali&s;ts, as the <HI>Calvini&s;ts;</HI> and all your Con&s;equences under this Head, follow as much from the Doctrine of one Party, as the other. And all the Que&s;tion between us upon this Head is; Whether Per&s;ons when they do truly believe, and re|pent, have not &s;ome further, and more &s;pecial Illuminations of the Spirit: Some more powerful, and &s;overeign Influences; than they had before, when they were in a State of Impenitency? And whe|ther they have &s;uch a Liberty of Indifference, that they can believe, and repent, without the&s;e further Illuminations and A&s;&s;i&s;tances? And that you may be &s;atisfied of your Mi&s;take, I would intreat you to &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider the Texts of Scripture brought by my Brother; to prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;pecial Influences, of the divine Spirit, to convert the Souls of Men; <HI>and make them meet for an Inheritance among the Saints in Light;</HI> more than what are common to all Men in general. And particularly, JOH. vi. 44. <HI>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</HI> Mr. BEACH &s;ays, (2d <HI>Reply</HI> p. 43.) <Q>God has drawn Millions, who never were actually drawn &s;o as to come to Chri&s;t. So God drew the whole Body of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation &mdash; JER. xxxi. 3. <HI>With Loving-kindne&s;s have I drawn them.</HI></Q> But can you imagine that our Saviour meant nothing more than the drawing of his common Grace, and Providence, when he expre&s;ly tells us, what his meaning was? <HI>Viz.</HI> That no Man could come to him, except the Father draw him in &s;uch a manner, as that there would be an actual Fulfilment, of the Prophecies of the Old
<PB N="25" REF="006483_0024_10290DCDC194FBC8">Te&s;tament, &s;poken concerning &s;uch as believe in the Me&s;&s;iah. As in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>It is written in the Prophets, And they &s;hall be all taught of God: every Man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> The Places, in the Prophets, which our Savi|our refers to, are ISAI. liv. 13. <HI>And all thy Children &s;hall be taught of the Lord; and great &s;hall be the Peace of thy Children.</HI> And, JER. xxxi. 34. <HI>For they &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them, unto the greate&s;t of them; &s;aith the Lord. For I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more.</HI></P>
<P>But I had like to have forgot, that it is not &s;o much my pre&s;ent Bu|&s;ine&s;s to prove the Truth of our Principles, as to re&s;cue them, from the bad Con&s;equences, which you imagine are deducible from them. And thus I have, I think, fairly entered into the Merits of the Cau&s;e: And whether it does not evidently appear, that every one of the&s;e Con&s;equences which you have mentioned; do as much follow from your Principles, as from ours; and mo&s;t of them va&s;tly more; I mu&s;t leave it to you, and others to judge.</P>
<P>Mr. BEACH mentions a great Number of bad Con&s;equences, which he thinks are deducible from our Principles; but upon looking over them; I can't find any of them, but what have been fairly con&s;idered under &s;ome of the foregoing Heads: except a general one, which he mentions (1&s;t <HI>Repl.</HI> p. 66.) in the&s;e Words, <Q>I verily believe, this horrible Notion of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God, propagated by the <HI>Calvi|ni&s;tic</HI> Doctrines; is the principal Cau&s;e of that Malice, and ill Na|ture, which appears in many <HI>New-Light</HI> People.</Q> But is it from the Abundance of his own good Nature, that he endeavours to load the Memory of my Brother, with per&s;onal Reproaches, though at the &s;ame Time, he profe&s;&s;es that he believes he is rejoicing in Glory? The Phari&s;ees (who he &s;ays were <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI>) &s;hewed more good Na|ture than this comes to; for though they per&s;ecuted good Men when they were alive; yet to make them Amends, they built Tombs for them when they were dead. And I believe, I could give &s;ome &s;uch In&s;tances of Uncharitablene&s;s among &s;ome of the noted <HI>Arminians,</HI> as could hardly be found among any others that profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity. <Q>DANIEL TILENUS (in the Words of a celebrated Author,) became &s;o heated in Favour of <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> that he declared, were he obli|ged to change his Religion, he would turn <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;ooner than <HI>Calvi|ni&s;t;</HI> for he denyed that the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> believed in God; but owned that the <HI>Truks</HI> did.</Q> This was the Man that Mr. BEACH depen|ded upon for his Voucher; who, he &s;ays, was a Friend to the Synod
<PB N="26" REF="006483_0025_10290E0C6C623A78">of <HI>Dort.</HI> And other, In&s;tances might be found nearer home; but I take no Plea&s;ure in mentioning the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now beg leave in my Turn to mention &s;ome of the bad Con|&s;equences, which I think do peculiarly &s;low from ARMINIAN Prin|ciples. &mdash; And</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of the bad Con&s;equences that follow from this Principle; that God's <HI>Decrees</HI> do nece&s;&s;arily influence every Event; which he has decreed. All your Arguments, or at lea&s;t the mo&s;t of them, are founded upon this Principle; And all the <HI>Arminian</HI> Writers that I have ob&s;erved, go upon the &s;ame Principle. And indeed if they did not think, that God's Decrees do influence the decreed Event; more than his Fore knowledge; what Pretence could they have to fa&s;ten bad Con&s;equences upon our Doctrine? But upon this their Principle, they mu&s;t believe the Doctrine of God's nece&s;&s;itating De|crees of Reprobation. It is true, we do believe as well as they (and not at all more than they) that God did Decree to &s;end the Non-Elect into the World involved in Sin and Mi&s;ery, and to leave them to live, and die in Sin; and to puni&s;h them for their Sins: But then <HI>we</HI> don't believe, that God's Decrees have any Manner of Influence upon us, we are as much at Liberty, and act as freely, as if there were no Decrees at all.</P>
<P>But <HI>they</HI> think, there is &s;ome Influence; &s;ome Efficiency in God's Decrees, to produce the Event. And hence; though they leave the Elect of &s;hift for them&s;elves; yet this Principle con&s;igns over the Non-Elect to Sin, and Damnation without Remedy. <Q>They have no Offer of Chri&s;t and Salvation; for an Offer upon an Impo&s;&s;ible Condition is no Offer at all! They have no Time of Tryal.</Q> For to what Purpo&s;e is it for them to try to counteract the Influences of the Decrees of the Almighty? And be&s;ides, does not this Doctrine charge all the Sin, and Wickedne&s;s of Men, upon the Holy Decrees of the ble&s;&s;ed God?</P>
<P>I hope, you'll not think to an&s;wer this by "Put-offs," as though the <HI>Arminians</HI> don't believe God's Decrees; but only that God has an infallible Fore-knowledge of future Events.&mdash;For, I &s;uppo&s;e, there is not an <HI>Arminian</HI> of any Sen&s;e upon Earth; who will deny, that God has decreed to permit Sin. <HI>Arminius</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, (<HI>Exam.</HI> in TWISS. Vind. <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. p. 172.) <HI>Quod Deus volens permittit Peccatum, certum e&s;t.</HI> That it is certain, that God does willingly permit Sin. And in the next Page, you will &s;ee what he means by the Permi&s;&s;ion

Now if God has decreed to &s;u&s;pend, or with-hold all tho&s;e Things that would hinder the Commi&s;&s;ion of Sin, and this De|cree does nece&s;&s;arily influence the Event; how is it po&s;&s;ible to vindi|cate the Decree of God, from being the Cau&s;e of Sin? If you &s;hould think upon a Review of the Ca&s;e; that Dr. WHITBY, and Mr. BEACH, and you, have gone too far, in a&s;&s;erting that God's Decrees do nece&s;|&s;arily influence the Event, which he has decreed; but yet do &s;till re|tain the Opinion, that God's Decrees have &s;ome kind of Influence, or Efficiency in producing the Event; (more than the Fore-know|ledge of God has in producing the Thing fore-known,) how is it po&s;|&s;ible for you to clear the Decree of God, from being in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, the Cau&s;e of the Sin, and Damnation of the Non-Elect?</P>
<P>If God decreed to &s;u&s;pend, or with-hold all tho&s;e Things, that would hinder the final Impenitency, and Damnation of the Non-Elect, and this Decree has &s;ome Kind of Influence upon the Event, then the Decree mu&s;t in &s;ome Sen&s;e be the Cau&s;e of it. But indeed there is no Medium in this Ca&s;e; God's Decrees mu&s;t either nece&s;&s;arily influ|ence the Event, or not at all, any more than his Fore-knowledge.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> appears to me to be very di&s;honourable to God, and hurtful to the Souls of Men. The <HI>Arminians</HI> profe&s;s, that they believe the intire, and univer&s;al Depravity of Nature; as much as we do: As I have proved before. But yet they deny, that we derived our corrupt, and &s;inful Di&s;po&s;ition from <HI>Adam,</HI> as he was our Faederal Head, or Repre|&s;entative, in the fir&s;t Covenant. That we were to &s;tand, or fall by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Obedience, or Di&s;obedience as our legal, or Faederal Head, Mr. BEACH &s;ays (2d <HI>Repl.</HI> p. 54.) is but a <HI>Fable.</HI> But does not this Doctrine, directly charge God with being the Author of Sin? Dr. JOHNSON &s;eems in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to be &s;en&s;ible, that this Con&s;equence is unavoidable. He &s;ays (Pref. to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s 2d Repl. p. 10.) <Q>You a&s;k, what I a&s;&s;ign as the true Cau&s;e of the Creature's moral Imperfection. I an&s;wer, if by moral Imperfection, you mean (as you mu&s;t) if you &s;peak of the imperfect, or le&s;s perfect Condition, in which it is made, or born, before it is capable of moral Action; it is no Imputation upon the Almighty, to &s;ay, he is the Cau&s;e of it.</Q> He owns (p. 9.) that Infants are born with <HI>material Sin;</HI> and yet thinks it is no Imputation upon the Almighty, to &s;ay that he is the Cau&s;e of it. If Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> joins with Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> in this; I
<PB N="28" REF="006483_0027_10290E0F97631F20">don't wonder he &s;ays (2d <HI>Repl.</HI> p. 26.) <Q>that he believes Original Sin, in a more <HI>rigid</HI> Sen&s;e than my Brother did.</Q> For it is a more <HI>rigid</HI> Sen&s;e, &s;ure enough! to charge our Original Corruption, and &s;inful Depravity upon the Almighty! &mdash; But to go on,</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> (as they ex|plain it,) repre&s;ents the Merits of Chri&s;t's Sufferings, and Death, as being but of little Efficacy, and Value. They deny, that ever Chri&s;t <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> Faith, or Holine&s;s, for any one Per&s;on Elect, or Non-Elect. So that if Per&s;ons ever arrive to Heaven, it mu&s;t be without Faith, or Holine&s;s; notwith&s;tanding any Efficacy, that there is in the Merits of Chri&s;t. The Scriptures every where repre&s;ent Chri&s;t's Death, as meritorious not only to procure Pardon, and Life for us; but likewi&s;e, to purcha&s;e the Gifts of the divine Spirit to purify our Souls, and qualify us for Glory. And hence the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, TIT. 2.14. <HI>He gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>But if the <HI>Arminians</HI> &s;hould allow that there is any Efficacy in the Blood of Chri&s;t, to clean&s;e us from the Pollution, and Defilement of Sin; it would totally demoli&s;h their Scheme: becau&s;e, if Chri&s;t pur|cha&s;ed Holine&s;s for any Per&s;ons, it would be nece&s;&s;ary in the Nature of Things, that they &s;hould have it. And therefore they ab&s;olutely deny this. Thus Dr. WHITBY &s;ays, (upon the five Points, p. 108. 109.) <Q>No Sacrifice for Sin; as &s;uch, no, not that of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, can &s;anctify a Soul, or endow it with that divine Na|ture; that inward Purity, and Likene&s;s to God; and all tho&s;e other chri&s;tian Virtues, which alone make us capable of the Enjoy|ment of God.&mdash;Chri&s;t therefore by his Death alone, cannot be &s;aid to have <HI>procured</HI> that Faith, which purifies the Heart; or that Re|pentance, which renews the Mind, the Will, and Affections; but only to remove that Guilt, which doth ob&s;truct God's Favour.</Q> <HI>He that can receive</HI> &s;uch Doctrine, <HI>let him receive it!&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>Again, according to their Doctrine, there was no Efficacy in the Death of Chri&s;t, to render the Salvation of any one Per&s;on <HI>certain.</HI> As &s;ome do refu&s;e the Benefits of redeeming Mercy; &s;o all might do it, and his Death might have been wholly in vain; notwith&s;tanding any Intention, that Chri&s;t had to &s;ave any one Per&s;on: or notwith&s;tanding any Efficacy in his Merits. When Chri&s;t made his Soul an Offering for Sin, he could not have this Comfort, and Satisfaction, ari&s;ing from any Efficacy in his Sufferings, (according to this Doctrine;) <HI>to &s;ee his Seed, and the Travel of his Soul, to ju&s;tify many;</HI> becau&s;e it was uncer|tain,
<PB N="29" REF="006483_0028_10290DD2237A8118">notwith&s;tanding his Agonies, and Death, whether any would be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Your Doctrine, that all Men have <HI>&s;ufficient Grace</HI> for Salvation: contains a Swarm of bad Con&s;equences. You &s;ay (p. 31, 32.) <Q>Don't the <HI>Arminians</HI> unitedly agree, that God has by the glorious Reve|lations of his Spirit, &s;et forth in the View of Mankind, the infinite Evil of Sin, and the divine Amiablene&s;s of Holine&s;s; and that he has given to Man, a Power of Con&s;ideration, whereby with the con&s;tantly concurring Influences of his Holy Spirit, they can freely examine and bring home to their Minds, the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of Religion; and the Deceit, Evil, and Bitterne&s;s of Sin; and that on &s;uch a View of Things, they have a Power to re|fu&s;e the one, and embrace the other, by the free Choice of their Wills?" And in (p. 43.) You &s;ay, "It is (according to <HI>Arminans,</HI>) intirely in your Power, through the con&s;tant Concurrence, and In|fluence of divine Grace, to chu&s;e and obtain eternal Life.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. According to this Doctrine, GOD is not to be acknowledged, as the <HI>Author</HI> of all that is &s;piritually Good in us. According to the &s;cripture Account, it is <HI>God that works in us both to Will and to Do. He works all the good Plea&s;ure of his Grace in us, and even the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> Hence the Apo&s;tle prayed for the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> that <HI>they might know what is the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power, to us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty Power.</HI> Eph. i. 18, 19. But according to your Doctrine, good Men have no other Influ|ences of the Spirit of God, than what are common to all Men. Every Man has &s;uch con&s;tant A&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Holy Spirit, that he has it intirely in his own Power to believe, and repent; and no other A&s;|&s;i&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary. So that if there be any good in us, more than in &s;ome others, we our&s;elves are the Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your Doctrine, has a direct Tendency to lead Men into a wrong Notion, concerning that great Change, which the Scriptures call <HI>Re|generation,</HI> or <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI> A &s;aving Conver&s;ion to God, is a great, and a mighty Change; &s;o that when we do experience it, <HI>we are cre|ated anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us to good Works, and become new Creatures,</HI> in all &s;piritual Re&s;pects. And tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who have not thus <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death, to Life;</HI> but live and die in an unregenerate State; they will find them&s;elves awfully di&s;appointed, notwith&s;tanding all their Self-flattery, and deluding Hopes, when they come to appear, before the Bar of impartial Ju&s;tice. And alas! How apt are Per&s;ons to delude them|&s;elves with fal&s;e Hopes! How prone to imagine, that they are in a
<PB N="30" REF="006483_0029_10290E145B311AF8">&s;tate of Grace, and Favour with God, when they have not &s;o much as the Seeds of true Holine&s;s! <Q>Fight not (&s;ays Mr. BAXTER) with &s;mall, or great, but again&s;t the fal&s;e Hopes of chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors.</Q> And what a &s;ad Tendency has your Doctrine, to make People ea&s;y, and <HI>&s;ettle them upon their Lecs?</HI> They are told, <HI>that as they have Grace &s;uf|ficient for Salvation, they have it intirely in their Power,</HI> to comply with the Go&s;pel; and therefore they think but little of the Importance, of laying a good Foundation in a &s;aving Conver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Doctrine, tends to keep poor Sinners in a &s;tate of carnal <HI>Security,</HI> without any concern about their Salvation. A &s;en&s;e of our own Impotency, and peri&s;hing State, unle&s;s God in his infinite Mercy <HI>will ca&s;t his Skirt over us, and &s;ay unto us, Live;</HI> is almo&s;t the only Thing, that excites a Concern in the Souls of Sinners, about eternal Things. When a Per&s;on is fallen into the Water, &s;o long as he thinks it is in his own Power to help him&s;elf, he is ea&s;y enough; but when he finds he mu&s;t unavoidably peri&s;h, unle&s;s he can obtain &s;ome Help, this Reflection, will make him concerned,: &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, if Per&s;ons had but a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e, of the mi&s;erable State that they are in, whil&s;t under the Dominion of Sin, and their utter Inability, to help them&s;elves; and that <HI>if God does ari&s;e and &s;ave them,</HI> it mu&s;t be owing to nothing, but his meer <HI>Mercy;</HI> they would not be &s;o little concerned, about the Means of obtaining the divine Favour. You &s;ay, <Q>Some think that all unconverted Men are <HI>Arminians!</HI></Q> And indeed I think, all &s;ecure Sinners, are in this Re&s;pect too much tinged with <HI>Ar|miniani&s;m;</HI> They have too much Self-Confidence, which is the grand Cau&s;e of their carnal Security. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. If unconverted Sinners are under &s;ome Concern about their Sal|vation; this Doctrine if received, would effectually <HI>&s;tifle</HI> the <HI>Convic|tions</HI> of their Con&s;ciences; and incline them, to <HI>put off</HI> their Conver|&s;ion until a further Opportunity. As men imagine, that their Conver|&s;ion, is a Thing that is within the Compa&s;s of their own Power; they think, it will be time enough afterwards. There are but few that are &s;o hardened in their Wickedne&s;s, as to have no thoughts of Death, and Eternity. And the mo&s;t abandoned Sinner, however he may <HI>&s;ay to God, Depart from me,</HI> and will even venture, to meet God in his loude&s;t Thunder; yet at Times he &s;ays in his Heart, <HI>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let la&s;t End be like his:</HI> But then he de|pends upon a future Repentance and drives away the Convictions of his own Con&s;cience, with a <HI>Go thy Way for this Time.</HI>&mdash;He feels him&s;elf in Health, he thinks he has a Pro&s;pect of living many Years; and he had learned from your Doctrine; that he has a Liberty of In|difference,
<PB N="31" REF="006483_0030_10290DD3ABE872B0">and a Power to believe, and repent, when he plea&s;es. And if he could but convince him&s;elf of one Thing further, that though he does all his Life time mock God, <HI>and trample under Foot, the Blood of the Convenant as an unholy Thing;</HI> yet the Prie&s;t can ab&s;olve him, when he comes to lie upon a Death Bed; and then he may die in Peace: I &s;ay, if he is convinced of the&s;e Things; it is no Wonder, if he does think it will be time enough to repent, when Old Age has cooled the Heat of his Lu&s;ts; or when he mu&s;t part with his &s;inful Plea&s;ures, at the Approaches of Death.</P>
<P N="5">5. Your Doctrine, (if received,) will effectually prevent the <HI>Humi|liation</HI> of a Sinner. God rejecteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the humble. There is hardly any one Thing that unfits the Souls of Men to receive Chri&s;t by Faith &s;o much as a Principle of Self-&s;uffi|ciency. A Belief that they are Something, when they are Nothing. An Imagination that they have &s;omething that is Good, and plea&s;ing to God; though they <HI>are Unbelivers, and their very Minds and Con&s;ci|ences are defiled.</HI> How can Men &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be <HI>All, and in all,</HI> when they have &s;omething el&s;e to rely upon? Among Men every Body can &s;ee, that a Malefactor convicted of a Capital Offence, again&s;t a merci|ful Sovereign, can't take beter Cour&s;e, than a Noble man did of late, acknowledge his Offence, with its aggravating Circum&s;tances, and ca&s;t him&s;elf intirely upon the Mercy of his Sovereign. And if poor Sin|ners would, from a real &s;en&s;e of their Sin, and Mi&s;ery, ca&s;t them&s;elves wholly upon the Mercy of God in Chri&s;t; humbly waiting at <HI>the Mercy-&s;eat,</HI> in the diligent U&s;e of the Means that God has appointed, this is the Way to <HI>obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need.</HI> But your Doctrine, teaches poor Sinners that they have &s;ufficient Grace already, if they do but improve it, (let them be ever &s;o gracele&s;s;) and it is intirely in their own Power, to &s;ecure their Salvation; what need is there then that they &s;hould be lo&s;t in them&s;elves, that <HI>they may be found in Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Your Principles tend to make Men think, that the Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to CHRIST is needle&s;s. The Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us that there is a &s;piritual Union between Chri&s;t and Believers, as <HI>he is the Head of the Body which is the Church; and they Members of the &s;ame Body.</HI> Faith is the Band of Union between Chri&s;t and Believers. And hence <HI>Chri&s;t is &s;aid to dwell in our Hearts by Faith.</HI> And &s;uch as be|lieve, are in Chri&s;t. <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new Creature.</HI>&mdash; This Union is the Foundation of our Ju&s;tification, Adoption, and Sanctification, (in the Beginnings, and progre&s;tive Growth of it;) as well as of eternal Glory. Our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>Without me (or out of me)
<PB N="32" REF="006483_0031_10290E16006BBE08">ye can do nothing.</HI> But what need is there of &s;uch a &s;piritual Union with Chri&s;t, if all Men have a Liberty of Indifference, to bend their own Wills, to that which is Good; and have it intirely in their own Power, to &s;ecure their Salvation, though they have no &s;uch &s;pecial Relation to him? Thus your Doctrine leaves us without any Foun|dation for a chri&s;tian Hope: <HI>For Chri&s;t is in us the Hope of Glory, if we have fled for Reluge, to lay hold on the Hope that is &s;et before us.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Your Doctrine, tends to &s;ap the Foundation of a Life of holy <HI>Obedience.</HI> All external Obedience, if it don't &s;pring from a new, and vital Principle of Grace, and Holine&s;s, is but meer Hypocri&s;y. And therefore Per&s;ons that are truly converted to God, are &s;aid, to have <HI>new Hearts.</HI> &mdash; <HI>Their Hearts are circumci&s;ed to love, and fear God.</HI> And <HI>God's Law is written upon their Hearts.</HI> They act from a new Principle of &s;upreme Love to God, and Faith in a Redeemer. And hence their Obedience flows in an uncon&s;trained Manner, as Waters from a Fountain; Our Saviour compares it, <HI>to a Well of living Water &s;pringing up to everlasting Life.</HI> But according to your Doctrine, there is no need of &s;uch a new Principle of Action: for every Man has it in his Power, to incline his Heart, to a true and unfeigned Obedience to God's Commandments; and <HI>his Commandments will not be grievous unto him.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Your Principles (if really received,)would prevent a Life of <HI>Faith,</HI> and Dependance upon Chri&s;t. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>our Life.</HI> And <HI>the Life</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle,) <HI>that I now live in the Fle&s;h, I live by the Faith, of the Son of God</HI> The Believer has his Dependance upon Chri&s;t, not only for Pardon, and Ju&s;tification; but for continual &s;up|plies of Grace; <HI>that of his Fulne&s;s he may receive, even Grace, for Grace.</HI> He is &s;en&s;ible of his own Emptine&s;s and of Chri&s;t's Fulne&s;s. He knows, that he has no Sufficiency of him&s;elf; but that all his Suffi|ciency is of Chri&s;t. And he always finds by Experience, that when he has the greate&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own Weakne&s;s; then he is &s;tronge&s;t; <HI>for he can do all Things through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening him.</HI> But by your Doctrine, Men are taken off from Chri&s;t, to depend upon them&s;elves. They have a Liberty of Indifference, and a &s;ufficient Power to hate Sin, and love Holine&s;s, and this is interwove in their Natures, as mo|ral Agents; What need then have they of fre&s;h &s;upplies of Grace from Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="9">9. Your Doctrine, tends to hinder Men from u&s;ing any Endeavours, to obtain any &s;pecial, or &s;en&s;ible <HI>Communion</HI> with GOD. Our Minds are naturally exceeding dark, and blind, with Re&s;pect to any realizing
<PB N="33" REF="006483_0032_10290DD538D145D8">View, or Apprehen&s;ion, that we have of the glorious Perfections of God. Men ben't &s;en&s;ible of the Darkne&s;s and Blindne&s;s of their own Minds, until they have been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, divinely illuminated. I have often thought, that our Ca&s;e may very well be compared, to that of a Man tha is born, and brought up in a dark Dungeon. He knows no Difference between Darkne&s;s, and Light, until he &s;ees &s;ome Gleams of Light, &s;hine through a Chink; which for the pre&s;ent ravi&s;h his Heart; but when the&s;e are intercepted, he &s;its and bemoans him|&s;elf, in his dark, and uncomfortable State. God is plea&s;ed to enlighten the Minds of good Men; e&s;pecially at &s;ome Sea&s;ons, and give them an inward Apprehen&s;ion of his glorious Perfections, in &s;uch a Manners, as to draw forth their whole Souls after him, as their Portion, and only Happine&s;s: &s;o that <HI>the Love of God is &s;hed abroad in their Hearts,</HI> and they can <HI>rejoice in God, with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI> So <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</HI> And our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>He will manife&s;t him&s;elf</HI> to true Believers.&mdash; But according to your Doctrine, there are no &s;uch &s;pecial <HI>Sealings of the Spirit.</HI> Every Man can know enough of God, by the con&s;tantly concurring Influences of his Spirit, and Grace, &s;o that he has it intirely in his own Power, to love God &s;upremely, and delight in him.</P>
<P N="10">10. Your Principles are directly Oppo&s;ite to true <HI>Thankfulne&s;s.</HI> When a Chri&s;tian has a View of his own Vilene&s;s, and Unworthine&s;s, &s;o that he appears loath&s;ome to him&s;elf; and yet at the &s;ame Time, has a Sen&s;e of the Riches of God's Grace, <HI>in plucking him as a Brand out of the Fire,</HI> this will excite true Thankfulne&s;s. He knows, that he was no better by Nature than other Men, and he has &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Aggravations of his own Sins, which he committed again&s;t God; that he looks upon him&s;elf to be <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all God's Mercies.</HI> He can &s;ay therefore as the Apo&s;tle, <HI>It is by the Grace of God that I am what I am.</HI> He wonders at, and admires, the Riches of God's Grace; in bringing him <HI>out of the horrible Pit, and miry Clay,</HI> when he might have been left, as well as many others, <HI>to trea&s;ure up to him|&s;elf, Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath.</HI> The Language of his Heart therefore is; <HI>What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits? Be|cau&s;e thy loving-kindne&s;s is better than Life; my Lips &s;hall prai&s;e thee.</HI> And he de&s;ires above all Things, that he may be more, and more, conformed to God; and that he may be more, and more, devoted to his Service. But according to your Principles, he is mi&s;taken, after all: God has not di&s;tingui&s;hed him, from any others, by any &s;pecial Influences of his Grace; and therefore it is owing to him&s;elf, and not to God, that he is in a State of Grace, and going to Heaven, while many others are going to De&s;truction; and he may thank him|&s;elf for it.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="34" REF="006483_0033_10290E17B5E823F0">
11. Your Doctrine, renders the great Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> e&s;pecially for &s;piritual <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tances,</HI> of little or no Importance. Let a Man be converted, or unconverted; what Influences of the Holy Spirit mu&s;t he pray for? If he be wicked, and ungodly, what divine Influences can he a&s;k for, more than he has already received? He can (it is true,) upon your Principles expre&s;s his Thankfulne&s;s, (&s;uch as it is,) to God, that he has made him a moral Agent; and endowed him with &s;uch Faculties; that he has a Liberty of Indifference, to chu&s;e that which is well plea&s;ing in his Sight; and has granted to him "the glorious Revelation of his Spirit, to di&s;cover to him the in|finite Evil of Sin, and the divine Amiablene&s;s of Holine&s;s:" And though he loves Sin and <HI>rowls it under his Tongue as a &s;weet Mor&s;el,</HI> but &s;ees no Beauty in Holine&s;s, and has not only the &s;tronge&s;t Aver&s;ion to it, but looks upon the Go&s;pel as a Delu&s;ion, and upon all tho&s;e who make any &s;erious Profe&s;&s;ion of it with Scorn, as a Pack of whining Hypocrites or over heated Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, yet he has it in his own Power to love, and delight in it, when he plea&s;es. What now has he to a&s;k for more? Mu&s;t he pray, that God would open his Eyes by the illu|minating Influences of his Spirit, to di&s;cover to him the odious Nature of Sin, the Amiablene&s;s of Holine&s;s, and the divine Glory, and Pre|ciou&s;ne&s;s of a crucified Saviour? No; this would be as Mr. BEACH expre&s;&s;es it, "to gape for <HI>New-Light."</HI> Mu&s;t he pray, that God would bow his &s;tubborn, and rebellious Will, and incline his hard, and impenitent Heart, to a willing Obedience, to the Go&s;pel of his dear Son? No: This would "de&s;troy his <HI>moral Agency."</HI> What then! Mu&s;t he pray, that God would deliver him from the reigning Power, and Pollution of Sin, by the purifying, and clean&s;ing Efficacy of Chri&s;t's Blood? No; "Chri&s;t never died to procure <HI>Sanctification</HI> for any Man; he died only to obtain <HI>Pardon."</HI> Well, if he died to obtain Pardon, man't he pray that God would pardon and ju&s;tify him, by the Imputation of CHRIST'S <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as he died our <HI>Surety</HI> and is <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> No: for "<HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s is <HI>infinite,</HI> and therefore can't be applied to a <HI>finite</HI> Creature." In a word then, may he pray, that God would give him a new, abiding Princi|ple of Faith, and Holine&s;s, whereby he may without fail, per&s;evere unto eternal Life? No: for then he mu&s;t "turn <HI>Calvini&s;t:"</HI> And he had as good be what he is; as to "wor&s;hip <HI>Fate,</HI> under the No|tion of a <HI>God."</HI></P>
<P>And upon your Principles, what &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings can we pray for in the Behalf of <HI>others?</HI> When Mini&s;ters Pray, that God would con|vert their wicked People; what do they hope that God will do for them more than he has done? Or when Parents pray for the Repen|tance,
<PB N="35" REF="006483_0034_10290DD9A7D89B78">and Conver&s;ion of their wicked Children, what can they mean by it?

<P N="12">12. Your Doctrine tends to <HI>depreciate</HI> the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and the <HI>Means of Grace.</HI> The Go&s;pel is "The Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth." And the Means of Grace are divine In&s;titu|tions, and do never &s;ail of producing their &s;alutary Effects, from any Ine&s;ticacy in them, as &s;uch; but from their being abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>And every &s;en&s;ible Chri&s;tian, mu&s;t needs prize and value the Go&s;|pel, and Means of Grace, as they are appointed by God, and effectual by his Ble&s;&s;ing, to promote their Salvation. But in&s;tead of depending upon the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, in the U&s;e of the&s;e Means; your Doctrine, teaches Men to depend upon their own Power, and their own Wills; which mu&s;t from the very Nature of their free Agency; have a Li|berty of Indifference, to Good, and Evil; whether they have or have not, the Means of Grace.&mdash;But to return,</P>
<P N="5">V. Your <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine, that we are not <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> by the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, <HI>imputed</HI> to us; and received by <HI>Faith;</HI> is of very dangerous Con&s;equence.</P>

<P N="1">I.

What I would ob&s;erve is, that he a&s;&s;erts that Chri&s;t wrought out a &s;ufficient Re|demption for all Mankind.&mdash;I never taught univer&s;al Redemption in any other Sen&s;e, or in &s;tronger Terms.</Q> And be&s;ides Mr. BEACH confines his Meaning, to my Brother's Opinion, concerning the Effect of <HI>Adam's</HI> Obedience; and the Advantage that would have accrued from it, to his Po&s;terity: And accordingly a&s;&s;erts, if all Mankind would have been in a confirmed State of Happine&s;s, by <HI>Adam's</HI> Obe|dience; then his Righteou&s;ne&s;s would have been infinitely more &s;uffi|cient, than the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; <Q>for Chri&s;t's mo&s;t holy Life, and dreadful Death, could &s;ave but a Part of Mankind.</Q> So that according to him, Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o infinitely defective, that it can &s;ave but a Part of Mankind! Is this, Sir, agreeable to the Scripture-Doctrine, that there is &s;uch an infinite Sufficiency, in Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the greate&s;t Sinner may flee to him for Shelter, from impending Wrath? But</P>
<P N="2">2. This Doctrine, teaches Men to <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> at lea&s;t in Part, to <HI>their own</HI> Obedience, for their Ju&s;tification before God. And hence they are in infinite Danger, of <HI>not attaining to the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e they &s;eek it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> <Q>Men may think they do Honour enough, to the great Redeemer, whil&s;t they acknowledge him, to be the meritorious Cau&s;e of Salva|tion;</Q> though at the &s;ame Time they tru&s;t to their religious At|tainments, imagining that they have &s;ome real Worth, or Value, (not to &s;ay Merit,) in them, to procure their Ju&s;tification. But alas! our be&s;t Duties are but as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> there is &s;o much Sin mixed with them, that our very Tears have need of Wa&s;hing in the Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Your <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine, that true Saints may <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>finally fall from Grace,</HI> gives Men a wrong Notion of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Mediator of it. The Word of God a&s;&s;ures us, that tho&s;e <HI>whom God loves, he loves to the End.</HI> That <HI>they who are ju&s;tified, &s;hall he glorified.</HI> That true Believers, <HI>will be kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> That <HI>when Men are born of God, their Seed remains in them;</HI> and therefore they cannot Sin unto Death. <HI>And
<PB N="37" REF="006483_0036_10290DDFB466C3B0">that they who do &s;in,</HI> (i. e. live in Sin,) <HI>have not &s;eem Je&s;us Chri&s;t, neither have they known him.</HI> And therefore it follows, that they who do &s;ee, and know Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will never be in &s;uch a State of Sin. But according to your <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine, a Per&s;on may be a good Man to Day; and in the Love, and Favour of God; but to morrow he may die, and go to Hell. But this Principle &s;uppo&s;es, that the Co|venant of Grace, is as precarious as the Covenant of Works, and Chri&s;t the Mediator of it, as mutable as <HI>Adam.</HI> According to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, <HI>God will write his Laws in the Hearts of his People, and he will be unto them a God, and they &s;hall be unto him a People.</HI> And hence, <HI>this Covenant is well ordered in all Things and &s;ure.</HI> And as Chri&s;t is an unchangeable Mediator; &s;o <HI>the Promi&s;es are in him all Yea, and Amen.</HI> And hence, true Believers have the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance, of the future Enjoyment of that great Good, which is promi&s;ed: &s;ince <HI>they know him, whom they have tru&s;ted, and that he will keep that which is committed to him.</HI>&mdash;God is willing in the Covenant of Grace, <HI>more abundantly to &s;hew unto the Heirs of Promi&s;e the Immutability of his Coun&s;el, and accordingly, has confirmed it with an Oath: That by two immutable Things, in which it was impo&s;|&s;ible for God to lie; we might have a &s;trong Con&s;olation who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before us.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir. I have con&s;idered &s;ome of the Con&s;equences, which ap|pear to me to be deducible from your Principles, taken &s;eparately; I might mention others that flow from them taken together; but as I have already exceeded the Bounds of my intended Brevity, I &s;hall mention but one; and that is, that your Principles tend to make Per|&s;ons believe, that it is va&s;tly <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> to obtain eternal Happine&s;s, than the Scriptures repre&s;ent the Ca&s;e. And hence, how naturally do Men content them&s;elves with a meer <HI>Form of Godline&s;s; while they deny the Power of it?</HI> Our Saviour (<HI>who knews what is in Man</HI>) &s;ays, Luke xiii. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate; for many, I &s;ay unto you, &s;hall &s;eek to enter and &s;hall not be able. And</HI> Matth. vii. 13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait Gate;&mdash;Becau&s;e &s;trait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.</HI> But you &s;ay (P. 43.) <Q>It is (according to the <HI>Arminians,</HI>) intirely in your Power, through the con&s;tant Concurrence, and Influence of divine Grace, to chu&s;e, and obtain eternal Life.</Q> If you have it intirely in your own Power to obtain eternal Life; what need is there, <HI>that you &s;hould work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling?</HI> I mu&s;t acknowledge, your Doctrine that God's Decrees do nece&s;&s;arily influence the Event; does eternally block up the Way again&s;t the Non Elect; otherwi&s;e all Men might obtain eternal Life with all
<PB N="38" REF="006483_0037_10290DE2A327AA10">imaginable Ea&s;e. And therefore it is no Wonder, if Men who em|brace the&s;e Principles, &s;ay, <HI>We &s;hall have Peace, though we walk in the Imagination of our own Hearts, to add Drunkenne&s;s to Thir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;equences which I have mentioned, do naturally follow (as I firmly believe,) from your <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles. But how|ever, if the People who embrace the&s;e Principles, don't appear generally, to be le&s;s concerned about their Salvation than other Men, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;hall have Rea&s;on to que&s;tion; whether I am not mi&s;taken. For the Effect, will bear &s;ome Proportion to the Cau&s;e, by which it is influenced. You &s;ay, (p. 8.) <Q>That you are un|qualified to hold the Ballance, to weigh the actual Effects of the re&s;pective Doctrines.</Q> But Mr. BEACH &s;eems to be more inge|nuous, and to freely own, that the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> do for the pre&s;ent live better Lives than the <HI>Arminians.</HI> His Words are (2d <HI>Reply</HI> p. 78.) <Q>And if any of you are wicked, <HI>(as I hope not,)</HI> yet this is not &s;o much the Fault of the Man, as his Principles; whereas if we are vi|cious, <HI>(as it is too true,)</HI> it is the Man, and not his Principles, that is to be blamed.</Q> His meaning mu&s;t be, that the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> are either better by Nature, or have better Advantages to be religious, than the <HI>Arminians;</HI> and that it is this, and not their Principles, that makes the Difference in their Lives. I grant, &s;ome Allowance ought to be made, upon the Account of the &s;uperior Advantages, which the <HI>Calvi|ni&s;ts</HI> generally have, more than the <HI>Arminians:</HI> But it is manife&s;t, this is not the only Thing, that makes the Difference, for there are &s;ome Arminians that enjoy the &s;ame Advantages with others; and yet are vicious.</P>
<P>But he intimates that the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> were not always the mo&s;t reli|gious; <Q>The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> (he &s;ays, <HI>ibid.</HI>) were rigid <HI>Proede&s;tinarians,</HI> or <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> as they are now called.</Q> And to prove this, why could he not &s;ay as Mr. <HI>Dodwell?</HI> <Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> being bred a Phari&s;ee, &s;pake and is to be interpreted, <HI>ex mente Phari&s;aeorum,</HI> according to the Doctrine of the Phari&s;ees.</Q> But be it &s;o, that the Phari&s;ees held the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination to eternal Life. Then it will follow, that this was the Doctrine of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church. For they were not only, the mo&s;t &s;trict in their Morals; but the mo&s;t orthodox in their Principles, of any Part of the Jewi&s;h Church. There were a great many of them Hypocrites, it is true; and they held one grand Error; <HI>for being ignorant of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, they went about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> and in this Re&s;pect they were <HI>Arminians.</HI> And their Hypocri&s;y, and Wickedne&s;s, was chiefly owing to this Prin|ciple; and not to their believing the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination, any more than their believing the Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="006483_0038_10290DE4432027D8">
But Mr. BEACH brings one In&s;tance more, (p. 79.) <Q>Look back (&s;ays he,) upon the State of our Nation, ju&s;t one hundred Years pa&s;t, in the Time of the grand Rebellion, never did the&s;e Principles pre|vail &s;o much-before, nor &s;ince, and never, was there &s;o much Wick|edne&s;s in the Nation.</Q> The grand Rebellion! I acknowledge the Propriety of the Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For to rebel again&s;t the Sovereign Authority of the Law, and &s;et up the lawle&s;s Will of a mi&s;guided Prince as the Standard of Government; is as grand a Rebellion as can be again&s;t any earthly Authority. But Mr. BEACH is mi&s;taken, when he thinks that our Principles prevailed chiefly in the Time of that grand Rebellion: For Archbi&s;hop LAUD, (who was no &s;mall In&s;trument in that Rebel|lion,) and a number of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> did openly profe&s;s the <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles at that Time; which they would not dare to have done &s;ome Time before. Dr. JOHNSON (Pref. p. 11.) owns, that <HI>Calvini&s;m</HI> prevailed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from within the <HI>Marian</HI> Per&s;ecution, to the Re&s;toration; i. e. until about 100 Years after the Reformation. So that it was the&s;e Principles, that com|forted, and &s;upported the holy <HI>Martyrs,</HI> when they were called to pa&s;s through the fiery Tryal, when <HI>they could rejoice with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI> And Mr. BEACH is likewi&s;e mi&s;taken, when he thinks, that there was more <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> in the Nation before the Re&s;to|ration, than there has been &s;ince: for it is manife&s;t, that the People in general were much more &s;ober, and &s;erious at that Time, than after the Re&s;toration; when a Flood of open Wickedne&s;s covered the Na|tion; the Dregs of which, have not been purged off until this Day.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have fini&s;hed the Ta&s;k, which you have a&s;&s;igned me. And may the God of Truth, lead us into all Truth.</P>
