<P>And I will give power unto my two witne&s;&s;es, and they &s;hall prophecy a thou&s;and two hundred and three&s;core days clothed in &s;ackcloth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mo&s;t important events, from the a|po&s;tolic age to the end of time, are exact|ly de&s;cribed in this book; among which the affair of the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es has a pe|culiar place. Who they are, why called two and no more, how they prophecy, and the effects thereof, are que&s;tions which have puzzled many, and have cau&s;ed much controver&s;y. Such darkne&s;s has at|tended it, that many &s;erious minds have been for avoiding any concern therewith. But &s;ince a ble&s;|&s;ing is pronounced upon tho&s;e who &s;hall read and hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein, how can any be willing to di&s;regard &s;uch ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? Therefore, with earn|e&s;t de&s;ires after it, let us attempt a brief an&s;wer to the above inquiries.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHO are the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es? In the words following we are told, that they are the two olive-trees, and the two candle&s;ticks &s;tanding before the
<PB N="4" REF="019485_0004_0FABAEE15A2B0538">God of the earth. This refers to the &s;tate of the church &s;oon after her return from Babylon. That return was encouraged and promoted by the civil power; but when her enemies, by fal&s;e accu&s;ations, procured a counter order from thence, the Jews ne|glected the hou&s;e of God, and pur&s;ued their own private concerns. Thus they went on for a num|ber of years, and then the prophets Haggai and Ze|chariah, were &s;ent to reprove and expo&s;tulate with them for this iniquity, and to call them to repen|tance and reformation; to promote which, a can|dle&s;tick, all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and an olive-tree on each &s;ide, was &s;et before one of the&s;e prophets. And upon his enquiring what it meant, the an&s;wer was, "This is the <HI>word of the Lord</HI> unto Zerubbable, &s;aying, Not by might, nor by power, but by <HI>my Spirit,</HI> &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts: who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubba|ble thou &s;halt become a plain, and he &s;hall bring forth the head-&s;tone thereof with &s;houting, crying, <HI>grace, grace,</HI> unto it." Zech. iv. 2&mdash;7.</P>
<P>THE work they were called to, was to build the hou&s;e of God; the mountain in the way of it was the oppo&s;ition of the world; Zerubbable was their governor, whom the &s;pirit of God would carry through all difficulties &s;o as to fini&s;h his hou&s;e, and free grace &s;hould have all the glory. The candle|&s;tick repre&s;ented the church of God, the oil his gra|cious influence, and the two olive-trees the medi|cines through which it was communicated; for they <HI>emptied the golden oil out of them&s;elves,</HI> ver. 12. So &s;ays our Lord, <HI>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth,</HI> John xvii. 17. Among his ancient people oil was made u&s;e of for food, for medicine, for ornament, for con&s;ecration, and for light, e&s;pe|cially in their tabernacle and temple.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019485_0005_0FABAEE2249EEC78">
THE Manna which was their food for forty years in the wilderne&s;s, ta&s;ted like <HI>fre&s;h oil;</HI> and it was to make them know, that man doth not live by bread only, but <HI>by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</HI> Num. xi. 8. Deut. viii. 3. Mat. iv. 4. Every word of his feeds the &s;oul, when re|ceived by faith. Oil was al&s;o of a kind and healing nature, and for that end was poured into the wounds of the man who fell among thieves; and of how much greater efficacy is grace to wounded con|&s;ciences? Oil likewi&s;e made their faces to &s;hine; which was but a &s;hadow of the <HI>beauties of holine&s;s</HI> that &s;hine in willing converts. P&s;alm civ. 15. cx. 3. Anointing was required in all their con&s;ecrations. The tabernacle, and all its rich furniture, with the prie&s;ts who mini&s;tered therein, were con&s;ecrated in this way: and oil had a &s;pecial place in their pub|lic offerings. Yea, with an horn of oil David was anointed king over the I&s;rael of God; all which were &s;hadows of the head and members of the Chri&s;tian church, that &s;piritual hou&s;e, that holy and royal prie&s;thood. 1 Pet. ii. 5, 9. Rev. i. 5, 6. And the oil for light, in the Jewi&s;h tabernacle and tem|ple, repre&s;ented the influences of the holy Spirit, whereby the go&s;pel church is made the light of the world, and the pillar and ground of the truth. Mat. v. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 15, 16.</P>
<P N="2">II. BUT why are the&s;e witne&s;&s;es called two and no more? In Zechariah's time there was but one te&s;tament, as well as one church; what then was in|tended by the two olive-trees? An&s;wer, The occa|&s;ion and de&s;ign of witne&s;&s;es is to prove points of im|portance which are di&s;puted, e&s;pecially in the affairs of government: and all &s;uch di&s;putes in our world came in by calling in que&s;tion the truth and equity of God's revealed will, whereby all ought to be go|verned.
<PB N="6" REF="019485_0006_0FABAEE2F3896BA0">And for him to foretel exactly the future actions of moral agents, and his ju&s;t dealings towards them; and then clearly to record the accompli&s;h|ment of tho&s;e predictions, with the verification of his promi&s;es and threatenings, are the &s;tronge&s;t evi|dences that can be given, of his right to govern the world, and that he governs it right.</P>
<P>HENCE he warns all again&s;t fearing any man as his prophet, who&s;e prophecy does not follow or come to pa&s;s. And Chri&s;t is there promi&s;ed as the ante|type of Mo&s;es, who mu&s;t be <HI>heard in all things,</HI> up|on the penalty of being <HI>de&s;troyed from among the people.</HI> Deut. xviii. 18&mdash;22. Acts iii. 22, 23. And to the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es, of expre&s;s predictions, and their exact accompli&s;hment, he makes his ap|peal again&s;t the brazen ob&s;tinacy, and wilful treach|ery of the Jews, who were tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the womb. I&s;ai. xlviii. 1&mdash;8. His prophets were mortal, but their words were not &s;o. Many of them were verified in the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and to expo&s;e the folly of unbelief and di&s;obedience in tho&s;e who returned from it, he &s;aid, <HI>My words and my &s;tatutes, which I commanded my &s;ervants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they re|turned and &s;aid, Like as the Lord of ho&s;ts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, &s;o hath he dealt with us,</HI> Zech. i. 6. They acknowledged that his words were truth, and al&s;o that they were according to ju&s;tice and equity; &s;o that here were two olive-trees, two witne&s;&s;es, when there was but one church. And how much deep|er root did the&s;e trees take when our Saviour came, and fulfilled the law, both moral and ceremonial, and accompli&s;hed all the prophecy concerning him, which had been publi&s;hed from time to time for four thou&s;and years?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019485_0007_0FABAEE39CCC5468">
HE was fir&s;t promi&s;ed as the &s;eed of the woman, then of Abraham, then of Judah, then of David, in who&s;e line was Zerubbable, the builder of the &s;econd temple; and the promi&s;e of his being made <HI>as a &s;ignet,</HI> pointed directly to Chri&s;t, the precious corner &s;tone in Zion. Hag. ii. 23. Acts iv. 11. Matthew has proved that Jo&s;eph was the legal heir to David's crown, and Luke has traced the line from Mary up to David, who&s;e family was reduced &s;o low as not to be able to provide a lamb, even when the Son of God was publicly pre&s;ented in his hou&s;e; a greater glory than ever appeared in the temple built by Solomon. That they were &s;o poor is evident, becau&s;e the birds then brought were not allowed of, when the fir&s;t-born was pre&s;ented, but only in ca&s;e of inability to provide a lamb. Levi. xii. 6, 8. Luke ii. 24. Well then did the prophet &s;ay, <HI>Who hath believed our report?&mdash;for he &s;hall grow up as a root out of a dry ground.</HI> Who could believe that a child thus born could be the mighty God, the Me&s;|&s;iah &s;o often &s;poken of, who &s;hould conquer all his enemies, and e&s;tabli&s;h an everla&s;ting kingdom! None ever did believe it but &s;uch as were <HI>taught of God.</HI> John vi. 44, 45.</P>
<P>DAVID was &s;o taught, and thereby was led ex|actly to foretel the rage of Jews and Gentiles again&s;t Chri&s;t; his being betrayed by a profe&s;&s;ed friend, and having his hands and feet pierced, and gall and vinegar given him by his enemies; his la&s;t prayer to the Father; his re&s;urrection, a&s;cen|tion, and &s;e&s;&s;ion at the Father's right-hand, with his glorious gifts to his people, and vengeance on his impenitent foes. P&s;alm ii. 1&mdash;12. xvi. 10, 11. xxii. 1, 16. xli. 9. xlv. 1&mdash;7. lxviii. 17&mdash;21. lxix. 21. cx. 1&mdash;6. All which, with innumera|ble other predictions, were exactly verified in Je&s;us
<PB N="8" REF="019485_0008_0FABAEE4C6033328">Chri&s;t; &s;o that though John, who came to prepare his way, was a burning and &s;hining light, yet his greate&s;t <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> were the <HI>works,</HI> which were fore|told by the Father, and fini&s;hed by the Son. John v. 36. viii. 17, 18. The apo&s;tles explained the pro|phets, and recorded the perfect accompli&s;hment of their predictions, and al&s;o the laws and orders of the go&s;pel church; and upon this foundation <HI>both</HI> Jews and Gentiles had acce&s;s by <HI>one Spirit</HI> unto the Fa|ther, and <HI>both</HI> partook of the <HI>root and fatne&s;s of the olive-tree.</HI> Eph. ii. 18&mdash;22. Rom. xi. 6, 17. Thus the two candle&s;ticks appear to be the old and new te&s;tament churches, and the two olive-trees, the &s;pecial laws and in&s;titutions given to each of them, through which God communicated his grace. Twelve patriarchs con&s;tituted the fir&s;t, and twelve apo&s;tles the la&s;t of the&s;e churches; and their union is undoubtedly repre&s;ented by the twenty-four el|ders whom John &s;aw. The apo&s;tles were &s;et before the prophets, as their true interpreters, in the fir&s;t building of the Chri&s;tian church, and &s;o they will be in her triumph over Babylon. Rev. v. 8, 9. xviii. 20.</P>
<P N="3">III. HOW do the&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;till prophecy, &s;ince the volume of in&s;piration is compleated? An&s;wer, As the nature and order of the fir&s;t creation, the pri|mitive &s;tate of man, his fall, and the only way of recovery, as well as the future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, could not have been clearly known by him without pure revelation, &s;o none can preach the&s;e great articles aright without the <HI>&s;pirit of faith.</HI> Tho&s;e who are <HI>in the fle&s;h, cannot plea&s;e God. If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 13. Rom. viii. 8, 9. The go&s;|pel mini&s;try is committed to none but <HI>faithful men.</HI> To &s;uch only does he &s;ay, <HI>Lo I am with you alway,
<PB N="9" REF="019485_0009_0FABAEE66E84DFE0">even unto the end of the world.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 1, 2. Mat. xxviii. 20. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> they &s;peak unto men to edification, and exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">tion, and comfort, they <HI>prophecy;</HI> and thereby the &s;ecrets of unbelievers hearts are made manife&s;t, and they are turned from &s;in to God. And each per&s;on &s;o turned, hath the <HI>witne&s;s in him&s;elf</HI> of the eternal truth of the <HI>re|cord</HI> which God hath given of his Son, while others charge him with <HI>lying</HI> therein. 1 Cor. xiv. 3, 24, 25. 1 John v. 9, 10. And as with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o with the mouth con|fe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation; and &s;aints receive one another as Chri&s;t receives them, to the glory of God. They fir&s;t <HI>give them&s;elves</HI> to him, and then unto the church <HI>by his will.</HI> Rom. x. 10. xv. 7. 2 Cor. viii. 5. Which is the exact nature of a go&s;|pel covenant; and it can no more be the duty of any &s;oul to keep any covenant contrary to the revealed will of God, than it can to fear man in&s;tead of him. And the&s;e &s;piritual weapons were more exten&s;ively victorious in the apo&s;tolic age, than the Roman &s;word had ever been. And as God has ever go|verned the world with a &s;pecial regard to his elect, in and by whom his witne&s;&s;es are held up, &s;o their cries have procured ble&s;&s;ings or plagues upon the earth, as often and as far as their wills have been one with his will. 1 John v. 14, 15. Luke xviii. 7, 8. James v. 17, 18. Al&s;o the light which they have held up, has been terrible to guilty con&s;ciences; therefore they are truly &s;aid to &s;mite the earth with plagues as often as they will, and to torment its in|habitants. Context, ver. 5, 6, 10.</P>
<P N="4">IV. WHY do the&s;e witne&s;&s;es prophecy &s;o long in &s;ackcloth? An&s;wer, Becau&s;e the bea&s;t bears &s;way all that time; only his reckoning is by months, and theirs by days. Rev. xi. 2, 3. xiii. 5. His king|dom
<PB N="10" REF="019485_0010_0FABAEE6E74E2628">was founded in darkne&s;s, while they are the children of light; and months are named from the moon, which rules the night, as the &s;un does the day. The ceremonial law put a &s;pecialty upon e|very new moon; but when Chri&s;t came he took that hand-writing out of the way, nailing it to his cro&s;s, and warned his church again&s;t being brought into bondage, under tho&s;e weak and beggarly elements, by <HI>deceitful philo&s;ophy,</HI> and the <HI>commandments of men.</HI> Gal. iv. 9.10. Col. ii. 8&mdash;23. The fun|damental order of his kingdom is, that none <HI>can &s;ee it,</HI> nor have any right to <HI>power</HI> in it, until they are <HI>born again;</HI> and al&s;o that all &s;triving about who &s;hall be the <HI>greate&s;t,</HI> is excluded therefrom. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. Matt. xviii. 3, 4. xx. 24&mdash;27. Lord&s;hip one over another is here declared to be of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and by them is the holy city trodden under foot the forty and two months wherein the witne&s;&s;es prophecy in &s;ackcloth; which has ever cau&s;ed mourning in them&s;elves, and their being de&s;|pi&s;ed by others. And mourning in them&s;elves, and being de&s;pi&s;ed by the world, are undoubtedly the ideas intended by that cloathing. And when they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their te&s;timony, the bea&s;t that a&s;|cendeth out of the bottomle&s;s pit, &s;hall make war again&s;t them, and &s;hall overcome them, and kill them, and their dead bodies &s;hall lie in the &s;treet of the great city, which &s;piritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where al&s;o our Lord was crucified. And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, &s;hall &s;ee their dead bodies, three days and an half, and &s;hall not &s;uffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth &s;hall rejoice over them, and make merry, and &s;hall &s;end gifts one to another; becau&s;e the&s;e two pro|phets tormented them who dwelt on the earth. Rev. xi. 2, 3, 7&mdash;10.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="019485_0011_0FABAEE9F33D89D8">
AND how exactly does this de&s;cribe the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things through the world? How is <HI>truth fallen in the &s;treet, and equity cannot enter?</HI> A dead body or form of it is kept above ground, but how is its life and influence &s;hut out by men in power? This city is &s;o large as to include the place where our Lord was crucified; which was done by the ac|cu&s;ations of church officers, enforced by the &s;ecular arm. And within this city will be found all the blood which has been &s;hed under the Chri&s;tian name. It is &s;piritually called Sodom and Egypt. The &s;pirit of Sodom was pride, fullne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s; neither did they &s;trengthen the hands of the poor and needy, but were haughty and daring in their abominations be|fore God. Ezek. xvi. 49, 50. Egypt reaped great advantages by the I&s;raelites; but turned them all to gratify their own lu&s;ts, and mo&s;t cruelly to oppre&s;s the very people from whom they derived tho&s;e advantages. And how full is the word of this &s;pirit in our day!</P>
<P>THE bea&s;t that overcame and killed the witne&s;&s;es, came out of the bottomle&s;s pit. In his fir&s;t form he aro&s;e out of the &s;ea, and in his &s;econd he aro&s;e out of the earth; but then he exerci&s;ed all the pow|er of the fir&s;t bea&s;t. He was as &s;potted as a leo|pard, as cruel as a bear, and as terrible as a lion; yet he was very changeable. He was, and is not, and yet is. He is the eighth, and is of the &s;even, and goeth into perdition. Rev. xiii. 1&mdash;12. xvii. 8&mdash;11.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Roman empire was the greate&s;t bea&s;t in the world. Dan. vii. 7, 8. His heads appear to be different forms of their commanding power. Kings, con&s;uls, dictators, decem|virs, and tribunes, were all fallen before the apo&s;tle wrote, when pagan emperors ruled; and Chri&s;tian emperors ruled but a &s;hort time, before the <HI>little horn,</HI> the bi&s;hop of Rome, a&s;&s;umed the command over all the churches; to whom the ten horns gave their power. This <HI>eighth is of the &s;even;</HI> for his arbitrary power, which he carried to an amazing length, was enforced by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate, which was fir&s;t brought into the church by Con&s;tantine; and this practice was of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by whom the holy city has been trodden under foot.</NOTE> Now compare the&s;e characters with plain
<PB N="12" REF="019485_0012_0FABAEEB745402E8">facts. Chri&s;t commands his &s;ervants to let the children of the wicked one, grow together with his children, in the world, until the end of it; while he commands his church to put away wicked per|&s;ons from among them. Mat. xiii. 30, 38. 1 Cor. v. 12, 13. But leopards, bears and lions, are not more oppo&s;ite to the tender feelings of humanity, than many are to this liberty and purity. When the only true head of the church was de&s;ired to in|terpo&s;e his influence in the divi&s;ion of an e&s;tate, he &s;aid, <HI>Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</HI> And he commanded his mini&s;ters to depart out of every city, where his go&s;pel was not <HI>freely</HI> received, and not <HI>forcibly</HI> to carry away &s;o much as the du&s;t of their feet. Luke x. 7&mdash;12. xii. 14. But all earthly heads of the church have ever done the contrary.</P>
<P>THE head of the church of Rome aro&s;e out of the raging confu&s;ions of the Roman empire, by a my&s;tical confounding of Jewi&s;h ceremonies with Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, which is as bottomle&s;s as the ocean; and he a&s;&s;umed the power of <HI>dividing</HI> all the world among his votaries. No &s;ooner was our American world di&s;covered, than he, the very next &s;pring, pre&s;umed to di&s;po&s;e of it in as ample man|ner, by a formal deed, as any man could of his
<PB N="13" REF="019485_0013_0FABAEEBDF4CEC98">farm. And when temporal princes were &s;et up as heads of the church, they exerci&s;ed the &s;ame power. In each nation, their head, which aro&s;e out of the earth, &s;et up by the people, like a harmle&s;s lamb, yet &s;pake like a dragon, under the influence of the two horns, of church cen&s;ures and corporal puni&s;h|ments. All our American charters were given from that power; and from thence came our late mo&s;t cruel war. The &s;ociety in London who &s;ent their mi&s;&s;ionaries into our colonies, had an annual &s;ermon delivered before them, by the bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter, on Feb. 21, 1766, wherein he &s;aid, "The &s;preading of GENTILEISM in the colonies, calls for our rejected charity."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gloce&s;ter's &s;ermon, p. 11.</NOTE> And the next month it was re&s;olved in Parliament, that they had a right to BIND US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.&mdash;And before &s;aid &s;ociety, on Feb. 20, 1767, the bi&s;hop of Landaff accu&s;ed the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies of being "infidels and barbarians;" which, &s;aid he, "was contrary to the pretences and <HI>condi|tions</HI> under which they obtained <HI>royal grants</HI> and public authority." And after expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ires and hopes of the &s;peedy e&s;tabli&s;hment of bi&s;hops here, he &s;aid, "This point obtained, the Ameri|can church will &s;oon go out of its infant &s;tate, be able to &s;tand upon its own legs, and without foreign help <HI>&s;upport</HI> and &s;pread it&s;elf.

<P>AND we are to remember, that the bea&s;t which John &s;aw had a mouth like a lion; a bea&s;t that goes
<PB N="14" REF="019485_0014_0FABAEED793EDC88">forth to &s;eek his prey in the night, and does it by &s;itting up a dreadful roar, and then li&s;tening for the noi&s;e of creatures in their flight, and pur&s;uing them by the ear and not the eye; for when the morning cometh they retire into their dens. P&s;alm civ. 20&mdash;22. So, in a very dark time, twenty thou&s;and mercenaries were brought from Germany, to add terror to the roarings of the Briti&s;h lion, who blind|ly pur&s;ued his prey, from the lofty mountains of Ca|nada, to the plains and thickets of Carolina and Georgia, but could not catch it. Yet this bloody chace was no &s;ooner over, than the merchants of Baby|lon, even the <HI>great men of the earth,</HI> filled this coun|try with her &s;plendid and co&s;tly wares; by means of which public credit, or the faith of government in America, has been bought and &s;old for a trifle. And the &s;pirit of pride and luxury, like Sodom, and of tyranny, like Egypt, has prevailed amazingly. No effectual care was taken to &s;ecure a medium of trade among us, and yet public and private debts are demanded with great rigour; as if brick could be made without &s;traw. Yet hereby the word of God is verified, which is infinitely more precious than gold.</P>
<P>UNDER the plau&s;ible pretences of religion and government, the wor&s;t of evils have long been co|vered among all nations; but God has promi&s;ed to de&s;troy this covering, and to reveal and con&s;ume the man of &s;in, by the &s;pirit of his mouth, and the bright|ne&s;s of his appearing. I&s;ai. xxv. 7.2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3&mdash;12. Towards which he has now made great advances. Calling in que&s;tion the truth and equi|ty of God's revealed will, and &s;itting up the inven|tions and will of man again&s;t it, was the way where|by &s;in and death came into our world. The fir&s;t Adam, our public head, revolted from heaven, and
<PB N="15" REF="019485_0015_0FABAEEE1CB5EE08">&s;eized upon the earth as his own; and we all bear his earthly image, until we are born again, and &s;o are changed into the image of our &s;econd head, the Lord from heaven. Rom. v. 12&mdash;21. 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22, 47&mdash;49. To prepare who&s;e way &s;everal eminent men were rai&s;ed up, in different ages; as Noah, to &s;ave the human race from compleat de|&s;truction by the deluge, and Abraham, to be the father of the church of I&s;rael; each of whom were eminent types of Chri&s;t, as Mo&s;es al&s;o was of his prophetical, Aaron of his prie&s;tly, and David of his kingly offices. But in the antichri&s;tian apo&s;tacy, the veil of the ceremonial law was drawn over the truth and glory of the go&s;pel. The covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion, which Je&s;us had nailed to his cro&s;s, was taken from thence, and called the covenant of grace; from whence it was declared that dominion is found|ed in grace. Common believers were put in the place of Noah and Abraham, and officers in the place of Mo&s;es, Aaron and David; and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive power in officers has been held up as a &s;acred thing ever &s;ince. Teachers procured the crucifixion of our Lord, by &s;aying, <HI>If thou let this man go, thou art not Cae&s;ar's friend;</HI> and an appeal to the <HI>king's laws,</HI> has been the refuge of hirelings in every age: But how has God now rent away this veil of darkne&s;s?</P>
<P>FOR no man can claim any power in our govern|ment that was not lately derived from the con&s;ent of the people, without appearing an enemy to his country; and this authority is acknowledged to be good by the greate&s;t Princes in Europe. And <HI>money</HI> forms the only qualification of the electors of our highe&s;t rulers; and it was a <HI>&s;orcerer</HI> who fir&s;t offered <HI>money</HI> for <HI>power</HI> in the Chri&s;tian church; and by &s;uch <HI>&s;orceries</HI> the whore of Babylon has <HI>deceived

Micah iii. 5&mdash;12. iv. 1&mdash;5. Col. iii. 17. Multitudes are &s;o aver&s;e to this, as clearly to verify the prophecy of Jude, who &s;ays, <HI>Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and peri&s;hed in the gain&s;aying of Core.</HI> In each of which ca&s;es man is to be &s;een rejecting the authority of God, and exalting &s;elf above him.</P>
<P>ELECTION is an honorable word with them, when applied to particular men, who&s;e <HI>per&s;ons they have in admiration becau&s;e of advantage;</HI> but when God makes u&s;e of the &s;ame word, to di&s;play the glories of his grace, men di&s;cover a perfect enmity again&s;t it. Like Cain, they would be accepted without faith in the blood of atonement; and becau&s;e God gave Abel that faith, and had re&s;pect to him and his offering in that way, Cain had a bloody rage a|gain&s;t him; <HI>becau&s;e his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</HI> Heb. xi. 4. 1 John iii. 12. As Cain was the elder brother, and govern|ment was then in families; Abel was &s;till a good &s;ubject and never injured Cain in any re&s;pect by his having the true religion. Gen. iv. 7. Neither did true religion ever injure any man in the world; and yet what enmity have many again&s;t it! Balaam knew that God had <HI>cho&s;en</HI> I&s;rael for his peculiar
<PB N="17" REF="019485_0017_0FABAEEF9C741E60">people, who &s;hould <HI>dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations:</HI> Yet, for an earthly reward, he taught Balak to lay a &s;nare, to draw them into whoredom and idolatry, and &s;o to de&s;troy that di&s;|tinction. And Chri&s;t warns his church again&s;t this &s;nare of Balaam, of Jezebel, and of the whore of Babylon. Num. xxiii. 9. xxv. 1&mdash;3. Rev. ii. 14, 20. xviii. 3, 4.</P>
<P>THE church is pre&s;ented as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t, unto whom none can be married, until, by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, they are made dead to &s;in and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, and alive to God; which great change is openly declared in bapti&s;m; and it is <HI>adultery</HI> for any to profe&s;s to be his in any other way. Rom. vi. 2&mdash;4. vii. 1&mdash;6. Before this change we all love the creature above the Cre|ator; and to go after any but him for temporal com|forts, is <HI>playing</HI> the <HI>harlot.</HI> Coveteou&s;ne&s;s is <HI>idola|try;</HI> and many make a <HI>god of their belly.</HI> Ho&s;ea ii. 5&mdash;8. Eph. v. 5. Phil. iii. 19. Yet daily at|tempts are made to draw the &s;aints into this whore|dom and idolatry, and that with Core's language. After it was mo&s;t clearly di&s;covered that God had <HI>cho&s;en</HI> Mo&s;es as his prophet, and Aaron as the head of the prie&s;thood, Core gain&s;ayed it, &s;aying, <HI>Ye take too much upon you, &s;eeing all the congregation are holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them.</HI> Num. xvi. 3. Which is the exact language of all teachers who refu&s;e to be governed by the laws of Chri&s;t, the only antitype of Mo&s;es and Aaron. They rule the church with <HI>force and cruelty,</HI> and trample down the good pa&s;tures, and foul the deep waters with their feet. That is, they corrupt the word of God, and try all arts to darken every thing therein which condemns their deceit and cruelty. And our only way of deliverance from &s;uch <HI>evil
<PB N="18" REF="019485_0018_0FABAEF05C616568">bea&s;ts,</HI> is the way of faith in and obedience to our &s;piritual David. Ezek. xxxiv. 4, 18&mdash;25. Un|der the law he gave his people re&s;t, on the &s;eventh day, in the &s;eventh year, and after &s;even times &s;even years; and under the go&s;pel he fir&s;t gives them re&s;t, and then they work for him. Heb. iv. 1&mdash;10. But they who wor&s;hip the bea&s;t can get no further than &s;ix, the toiling number, be they in units, tens or hundreds, <HI>they can never have enough; they have no re&s;t day nor night.</HI> I&s;ai. lvi. ii. Rev. xiii. 18. xiv. 11. Bea&s;ts act according to their carnal inclina|tions, without any regard to truth or equity; and &s;o do tho&s;e who empower &s;ome to judge for others about religious wor&s;hip, and to enforce their judge|ments with the &s;word. This bea&s;t has often chang|ed his name and appearance, upon which the cry has been, <HI>Who is like unto the bea&s;t? who is able to make war with him?</HI> And when his fraud has been detected, and his power defeated, he has &s;oon a&s;&s;umed another name and form, and then has pur&s;ued the &s;ame argument. Thus he was, and is not, and yet is; though he &s;hall finally go into perdition. Rev. xiii. 4. xvii. 8. And how earne&s;t &s;hould all be for this great event? For then all will know, that reli|gion never gives officers a right to the property of the people for nothing, nor the people a right to re|quire officers to go a warfare of their own charges; and al&s;o that no birth or doings of nature can give any &s;oul a right to the promi&s;es of grace, without per&s;onal faith therein. Ezek. xiv. 20. Gal. iii. 22. Heb. vi. 18.</P>
<P>NONE can be built upon the Rock without hear|ing and doing the <HI>&s;ayings</HI> of Chri&s;t; and his &s;ayings demon&s;trate, that the only heirs of the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom, are the poor in &s;pirit, the mourners, the meek, &s;uch as hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s,

Mat. v. 3&mdash;12. vii. 6, 12, 15, 24. Hence it is certain, that the di&s;tinction between his church and the world, is not <HI>carnal</HI> but <HI>&s;piritual.</HI> The bloody &s;ign of circum|ci&s;ion was a &s;eal to Abraham, of the faith he before had in Chri&s;t, in whom all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed. A de&s;cent from Abraham by blood, or a purcha&s;e with his money, were &s;ha|dows of the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t's blood, and of re|generation by his grace. But &s;ince his death, at|tempts to build his church upon the covenant of circumci&s;ion is <HI>falling from grace.</HI> The <HI>natural</HI> di&s;tinctions which it made among mankind, could not be countenanced by Peter nor Barnabas without <HI>di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> Rom. iv. 10&mdash;12. Gal. ii. 12, 13. v. 1&mdash;4. For by that covenant Abraham could not circumci&s;e any Gentile, until he had bought him as a &s;ervant with money; neither could he re|tain any &s;uch in his hou&s;e without circumci&s;ing him. Kings were to come out of him, and his &s;eed were to take the land of Canaan by the &s;word, when the iniquity of its inhabitants &s;hould be <HI>full,</HI> of which God was the &s;ole judge. Gen. xv. 16. xvii. 6&mdash;14. David was the king who fini&s;hed that conque&s;t, but for the wickedne&s;s of his po&s;terity the <HI>crown</HI> was taken from them, and was <HI>overturned, overturned, overturned,</HI> until Je&s;us came, and it was given to him. Ezek. xxi. 25&mdash;27. Luke i. 32. And he &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Circumci&s;ion is nothing, and uncir|cumci&s;ion

<P>AND how full is our world of &s;uch at this time! Bo&s;ton now imitates Jeru&s;alem herein, for no man in Bo&s;ton has ever been compelled to &s;upport any religious teacher contrary to his per&s;onal choice, &s;ince 1693; while her teachers and lawyers have re&s;olutely denied this liberty to the country, and have claimed a power to compel every pari&s;h to &s;ettle and &s;upport &s;uch teachers as they have called orthodox. And at the commencement of our new Con&s;titution, this practice was called GODLINESS, in capitals, while <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> was put in &s;mall letters. And a door was left open for the admi&s;&s;ion of Roman catholics into the highe&s;t offices in our government: to ju&s;tify which, it was &s;aid, "Religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and individuals."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Addre&s;s before the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Con&s;titution, 1780, p. 17.</NOTE> Since which one of their mo&s;t noted teachers, has publi&s;hed a book in London, wherein he carries his notions of the gift of grace &s;o high as to &s;ay, "Infallibly, if the greater part of the human kind, notwith&s;tanding this gift, and the <HI>abounding</HI> of it, are left to peri&s;h eternally, in con&s;equence of the lap&s;e through Adam, a broader foundation is really laid for their groaning under the damage by him, than for their rejoicing in the oppo&s;ite advantage derived to the world through Je&s;us Chri&s;t."

<P>BECAUSE Noah was a gracious man, and the &s;aving of his hou&s;e in the ark was a figure of our being &s;aved by bapti&s;m; and becau&s;e Abraham was a gra|cious man, who&s;e hou&s;hold con&s;tituted the Hebrew church, and were commanded by him to keep the way of the Lord, good men have imagined that re|ligion would fail from among them, if their infants were not baptized. But the experience of four times forty years in New-England, has entirely de&s;troyed the covering of this iniquity. Our Plymouth fa|thers held that the church was INDEPENDENT of the world, and to be governed wholly by the laws of Chri&s;t: But the ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts rejected that name, and called the church CONGREGATIONAL. They both held that none had any right to a governing power in the church but <HI>regenerate per&s;ons;</HI> and that all office power is derived from Chri&s;t, by his word and Spirit, to each particular church, and not
<PB N="23" REF="019485_0023_0FABAEF7790C62A8">by any local &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from any other men in the world. And our Plymouth fathers held, that each church was to act as a united body, their votes be|ing equal; but the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts held that no church act was compleat without the con&s;ent of the elders, and that rulers ought to compel the people to &s;up|port them. After forty years, they allowed the chil|dren of godly parents to be active in bapti&s;m, with|out any account of <HI>their regeneration.</HI> At the clo&s;e of the &s;econd period &s;uch were al&s;o allowed to come to the ordinance of the &s;upper, as a converting or|dinance. But an exten&s;ive revival of religion, at the clo&s;e of the third period, brought many to the knowledge of the <HI>new birth,</HI> which alarmed hire|lings; and the land has been filled with controver|&s;y ever &s;ince. The year 1780, compleated four times forty years, &s;ince New-England was planted; and it was a remarkable year of <HI>grace</HI> to many, and al&s;o of evidence that the name does not belong to the covenant of circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>ISRAEL were not to &s;et up any rulers over them, but <HI>brethren</HI> in their church; and adultery and bla&s;|phemy were capital crimes among them.

When they lo&s;t their charter, their &s;cheme of compelling the world to &s;ubmit to the government of the church, was de&s;troyed; and the world, by the help of mini|&s;ters,

<P>A CHURCH on our we&s;tern borders holds that "Infant bapti&s;m is admini&s;tered in a view of the <HI>parents being in covenant;</HI> but doth not &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>infant it&s;elf,</HI> to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>any right</HI> whatever, to the privileges of the covenent of grace." That their children, as well as others, are born <HI>under the cur&s;e;</HI> and that parents are under covenant obliga|tion to train them up in the nurture and admoni|tion of the Lord. Therefore when a man came from Connecticut, who had been heard to bla&s;pheme his Maker, and made &s;uit to a young widow in their church, who had children under their care, they warned her not to marry him; and becau&s;e &s;he did it, they excluded her from their communion.

<P>BLIND guides among the Jews &s;wore by gold and offerings, and not by the temple and alter whereby they were &s;anctified; upon which an eminent father of New-England &s;aid, "The e&s;tate of a &s;aint is mo&s;t happy and ble&s;&s;ed, though the per&s;on never come near an office; but on the contrary, an officer, if he be not al&s;o, and fir&s;t a &s;aint, is a mo&s;t wretched and accur&s;ed creature."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on again&s;t Bernard, p. 217.</NOTE> <HI>Anathama</HI> is the portion of every man who loves not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only <HI>altar</HI> that can <HI>&s;anctify</HI> us and our gifts. 1 Cor. xvi. 22. Heb. xiii. 10&mdash;18. The <HI>national holine&s;s</HI> of the Jews obliged them to put away their &s;trange wives, and the children that were born of them. Deut. vii. 3&mdash;6. Ezra x. 19, 44. From whence &s;educers took occa&s;ion to forbid marriage, and to command men to ab&s;tain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thank&s;giving of them who believe and know the truth: <HI>for it is &s;anctified by the word of God and prayer.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 1&mdash;5. Family relations, with other temporal en|joyments, are, in this way, <HI>&s;anctified and holy</HI> to believers; and will be much more &s;o in the latter day, after God &s;hall <HI>pour out his fury upon the fami|lies that call not on his name.</HI> 1 Cor. vii. 14. Jer. x. 25. Zech. xiv. 20, 21. None can e&s;cape his vengeance but <HI>he that walketh righteou&s;ly, and &s;peak|eth uprightly. he that de&s;pi&s;eth the gain of oppre&s;&s;ions, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that

I&s;aiah xxxiii. 14&mdash;24. His word, which is the only perfect law of liberty, contains three maxims which never &s;hould be forgotten by any. Fir&s;t, that none &s;hould be cho&s;en into office, but tho&s;e who have been u&s;eful and faithful in pri|vate &s;tations. Secondly, that &s;uch, like the olive, fig-tree, and the vine, prefer the yielding of good fruit and happine&s;s to others, to any promotion or power over them, Thirdly, that the man who makes u&s;e of any bribes or party influence to get into office, or to keep him&s;elf in power, is a <HI>bram|ble,</HI> that would &s;et all on fire rather than not have his will. Judges ix. 7&mdash;15. Acts xx. 28&mdash;35. Many of the primitive &s;aints &s;ealed the&s;e truths with their blood, and thereby overcame the great accu&s;er. And as the way for the fir&s;t coming of Chri&s;t was prepared by one who came in the <HI>&s;pirit and power of Elias,</HI> &s;o his future coming to reign on the earth will be introduced by the re&s;urrection of the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of tho&s;e old martyrs; which may intend the revival of their <HI>&s;pirit and power in the churches;</HI> for when they &s;hall ari&s;e <HI>&s;atan &s;hall deceive the na|tions no more,</HI> and when the two witne&s;&s;es &s;hall be rai&s;ed, <HI>time &s;hall be no longer.</HI> Rev. x. 6, 7. xi. 11, 15. xii. 11. xx. 3&mdash;6. And whether both prophe&s;ies do not point to the &s;ame glorious event, is humbly referred to the great Ruler of the univer&s;e.</P>
