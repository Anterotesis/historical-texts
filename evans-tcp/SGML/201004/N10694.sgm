<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent very critical &s;ituation of things in this country, in which you have &s;o much at &s;take, and in which it cannot be denied that you have con&s;iderable weight, is a &s;ufficient apology for an addre&s;s to you with re&s;pect to it. The approaching election for members of parliament calls for <HI>all,</HI> and perhaps for the <HI>la&s;t</HI> efforts of the friends of liberty in this country; and every real friend of this great cau&s;e among us, who is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of your ance&s;tors, will naturally look to you for the mo&s;t active concurrence and &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>Religious liberty,</HI> indeed, is the immediate ground on which you &s;tand but this cannot be maintained except upon the ba&s;is of <HI>civil liberty;</HI> and therefore the old Pu|ritans
<PB N="6" REF="013556_0004_0F90F6963101CAA8">
and Nonconformi&s;ts were always equally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their noble and &s;trenuous exertions in favour of them both. Their zeal in this cau&s;e, and the valuable effects of it, are &s;o well known, that even Mr. Hume (an hi&s;torian of the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pected impartiality in this ca&s;e) acknowledges, that whatever civil liberty we now enjoy is to be a&s;cribed to them. In fact, all our princes, who have ever entertained de&s;igns upon the liberties of their &s;ubjects, have been jealous of your principles and influence, and have accordingly u&s;ed their fir&s;t and utmo&s;t efforts to cru&s;h you.</P>
<P>THE race of the Stewarts felt that they could not ri&s;e except by your fall: but, fortunately your ri&s;e and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment ended in their extermination. The Tory mini&s;try, which prevailed at the end of the reign of Queen Anne, naturally enough began their attempts to re&s;tore the Pretender and arbitrary power by ho&s;tilities again&s;t you: and nothing but the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable and providential death of that unhappy and mi&s;guided prin|ce&s;s &s;aved you with your country. And&punc; la&s;tly, to come to the pre&s;ent times, that tho&s;e who actually guide the mea&s;ures, which are now carrying on in this country, are equally enemies to civil liberty and to you, can no more be denied, than that William the IIId. of glorious memory, and the two fir&s;t princes of the hou&s;e of Han|over, were friendly to both. Be a&s;&s;ured, that your pe|culiar privileges, and the general liberties of this country, are in&s;eparably connected, and that whenever the altar of civil tyranny &s;hall be erected, you will be the fir&s;t victims. As, therefore, you value the one, contend for the other.</P>
<P>WHAT was it but the tricks and artifices of the court, and the influence of the bi&s;hops, who have the &s;ame views and intere&s;t with the court, that fru&s;trated your late attempt to procure the repeal of but part of
<PB N="7" REF="013556_0005_0F90F696EB9034D8">
the many laws which bear hard on you, and the rights of humanity. The laws them&s;elves are &s;o repugnant to common &s;en&s;e and common ju&s;tice, that even your mo&s;t violent enemies could not but &s;ay, that <Q>no man could find in his heart to put them in execution.</Q> The equity of your bill twice carried it with eclat through the hou&s;e of commons; but all was bla&s;ted by a nearer approach to the throne, a throne from which mercy is extended to <HI>papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>rebels,</HI> becau&s;e friends of de&s;po|ti&s;m, and even to <HI>murderers,</HI> if they be employed again&s;t the con&s;titution of the country.</P>
<P>IT was by the artifices of courtiers that you were at fir&s;t per&s;uaded to believe that the pre&s;ent mini&s;try wi&s;h|ed well to your application: But by them you were even then &s;o far deceived, as to be per&s;uaded to clog it with <HI>a declaration,</HI> which, be&s;ides making it le&s;s acceptable to many among you, and intolerable to &s;ome, made it ea&s;y for the bi&s;hops to defeat the whole purpo&s;e of it.</P>
<P>WHAT can more plainly &s;hew the in&s;idious and ho&s;|tile intentions of the court, than the di&s;graceful hi&s;tory of your <HI>late tran&s;actions</HI> with re&s;pect to the &s;ame applica|tion? Was it not by courtiers that a majority of the members of your own committee were prevailed upon to drop the &s;olicitation of the bill, at the only time when there was a pro&s;pect of its &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> before the di&s;&s;o|lution of a hou&s;e of commons peculiarly friendly to you? Circum&s;tances &s;peak too plainly to deny this, when it is known that all who gave the deci&s;ive and fatal vote were tho&s;e who di&s;tribute the <HI>regium donum,</HI> except one, who is known to be particularly acquainted with &s;ome mini|&s;terial per&s;ons, a man of a weak and timid nature, and therefore peculiarly unfit to take the lead in a bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind. One mini&s;terial tool, and fal&s;e brother, is even &s;aid to have had the a&s;&s;urance to promi&s;e the mini&s;try, that they &s;hould have no di&s;turbance from the
<PB N="8" REF="013556_0006_0F90F69AEFE88AA8">
di&s;&s;enters this year. Does not the painful recollection of the&s;e things &s;timulate you to do &s;omething to wipe off your di&s;grace?</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ures that are now carrying on again&s;t the North American colonies are alone a &s;ufficient indica|tion of the di&s;po&s;ition of the court towards you. The <HI>pretence</HI> for &s;uch outrageous proceedings, conducted with &s;uch indecent and unju&s;t precipitation, is much too &s;light to account for them. The <HI>true cau&s;e</HI> of &s;uch vio|lent animo&s;ity mu&s;t have exi&s;ted much earlier, and deep|er. In &s;hort, it can be nothing but the Americans (particularly tho&s;e of New England) being chiefly <HI>di&s;|&s;enters</HI> and <HI>whigs.</HI> For the whole conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try demon&s;trates, that what was <HI>merit</HI> in the two late reigns, is <HI>demerit</HI> in this. And can you &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e who are &s;o violently ho&s;tile to the <HI>offspring</HI> of the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould be friendly to the remains of the <HI>parent &s;tock?</HI> I tru&s;t that both you and they will make it appear, that you have not degenerated from the principles and &s;pirit of your illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, and that you are no more to be outwitted or overawed than they were.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that a great part of the re&s;entment of the court again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters has ari&s;en from a notion that they were the chief abettors of <HI>Mr. Wilkes;</HI> and I be|lieve that, in general, they were the friends of his <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e it was the cau&s;e of liberty, and of the con&s;tituti|on. But they took no part in this bu&s;ine&s;s more than the other friends of this country: except that di&s;&s;enters, having more depending upon public liberty, are more intere&s;ted to keep a watchful eye upon every thing that relates to it. So that if your conduct in this affair has given <HI>peculiar</HI> offence, it mu&s;t have been becau&s;e the &s;ame conduct appears more offen&s;ive in you than in any others; which implies a prejudice again&s;t you <HI>as di&s;&s;ent|ers,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="013556_0007_0F90F69C66D74490">
of which you ought to be appri&s;ed, that you may act accordingly.</P>
<P>DO not imagine, however, that what I have hitherto &s;aid is a preamble to a declaration of war, or that I wi&s;h you to take arms in defence of your liberties, as your brethren in America will probably be compelled to do. That were equally ineffectual, and improper. But it is mo&s;t earne&s;tly to be wi&s;hed, that you would exert your|&s;elves in doing what the con&s;titution of your country both permits, and <HI>requires</HI> of all good citizens. Care|fully avoid all undue influence on the approaching elect|ion, and &s;trenuou&s;ly exert your&s;elves to procure a return of men who are known to be friends to civil and religi|ous liberty.</P>
<P>ATTEND particularly to the characters of the &s;everal candidates for whom your votes are reque&s;ted. Regard none of their <HI>profe&s;&s;ions</HI> of zeal for the public &s;ervice, but look to their pa&s;t <HI>conduct;</HI> and if, in any ca&s;e, they have promoted the corrupt mea&s;ures of the court, and have concurred in pa&s;&s;ing any of the late laws that are unfavourable to your liberties, be not acce&s;&s;ary to their <HI>future crimes,</HI> by giving them another opportunity of be|traying you, and acting the &s;ame part over again. More e&s;pecially avoid, as you would the pe&s;tilence, every man who voted again&s;t the repeal of the oppre&s;&s;ive laws to which you are expo&s;ed, and take every proper method of expre&s;&s;ing your ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their enmity towards you. Con&s;ider them as the declared enemies of liberty, ju&s;tice, and humanity.</P>
<P>THE conduct of the <HI>Quakers</HI> is &s;aid to be peculiarly cha&s;te and exemplary with re&s;pect to elections. They join as a body to di&s;countenance all undue influence, and admit not the &s;malle&s;t favour, or hardly a civility, from tho&s;e for whom they give their votes. And cer|tainly
<PB N="10" REF="013556_0008_0F90F69D965B9260">
you cannot too carefully avoid all &s;u&s;picion of corruption in a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much importance, and where freedom and independence of mind are &s;o much concerned.</P>
<P>THE popular cry again&s;t members of parliament is, that they are <HI>corrupt,</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient to all the mea&s;ures of the court; and that, in fact, they <HI>&s;ell</HI> their con&s;tituents. But is it really any wonder that a man &s;hould <HI>&s;ell</HI> what he is known to have bought and paid for? In&s;tead of making the office a matter of favour, honour, and tru&s;t, is it not made exceedingly burthen&s;ome and expen&s;ive to them? and is this an age in which a man can be ex|pected to be at very great expences, without endeavour|ing to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf? There <HI>are</HI> characters &s;o truly di&s;intere&s;ted and great. I could name &s;everal &s;uch; but, certainly, it were ab&s;urd to expect they &s;hould be found every where.</P>
<P>IF then you would have it in your power, with any face and decency, to call your con&s;tituents to account, or even upbraid them for &s;acrificing your liberties <HI>in</HI> the hou&s;e, do not oblige them to &s;acrifice their fortunes in order to get thither. Have no demands upon them <HI>be|fore</HI> they enter upon their office, that you may have the more <HI>afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>AN eminent foreigner has foretold, that <Q>England will lo&s;e its liberty, whenever the legi&s;lative part of the con&s;titution &s;hould be more corrupt than the exe|cutive.</Q> But he had no occa&s;ion to have &s;aid &s;o much. Our liberties mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be gone, when|ever the power of the hou&s;e of commons &s;hall be united to that of the crown, whether the court be corrupt or not. For how can there be any <HI>equilibrium,</HI> when every weight is thrown into one &s;cale. But he might have &s;aid farther, and more to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that the
<PB N="11" REF="013556_0009_0F90F69DB6431918">
hou&s;e of commons will lo&s;e its liberty and independence whenever the <HI>electors</HI> &s;hall be more corrupt than the <HI>elected.</HI></P>
<P>IF, therefore, you wi&s;h that your repre&s;entatives be uncorrupt and independent, fir&s;t &s;hew them the exam|ple of being &s;o your&s;elves. This &s;tep is certainly ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to gain your point, though it will not ab&s;olutely in&s;ure it. The di&s;ea&s;e may perhaps be too de&s;perate for any power of medicine; acquit your&s;elves however of all ju&s;t blame, by applying all &s;uch as are of approved efficacy. This conduct will at lea&s;t miti|gate the evil, and make you the objects of compa&s;&s;ion in your &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es of our con&s;titution are too many to yield to any remedy, while the court has &s;o much to give, and &s;o many lucrative places to di&s;po&s;e of; &s;o that it is to be feared, that though your members be &s;ent to parliament in the mo&s;t uncorrupt and honourable man|ner, they will not long continue uncorrupt. It is too much to be expected of human nature, e&s;pecially in this luxurious and expen&s;ive age.</P>
<P>THE radical fault is in the admini&s;tration of the re|venues. If this were in proper hands, and managed with propriety and frugality, &s;o that no part of it, and no <HI>place</HI> created by it, &s;hould come into the hands of your repre&s;entatives; or if the multitude of places were reduced to &s;uch only as are nece&s;&s;ary, and their enor|mous emoluments to a mere equitable payment for &s;er|vice done, it could not be made the intere&s;t of your &s;ervants to betray you; and they would then make your intere&s;t their own, becau&s;e there would be no other to come into competition with it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013556_0010_0F90F69E7077CE70">BUT though an effectual remedy may not be found, a palliative may be admini&s;tered, which may abate the virulence of the di&s;ea&s;e, and procure time for the ap|plication of &s;omething more efficacious. Though you cannot remove every temptation to which your repre|&s;entatives are expo&s;ed, becau&s;e many of them ari&s;e <HI>from others,</HI> at lea&s;t remove all tho&s;e that depend upon your|&s;elves. However they may be influenced to betray your intere&s;t <HI>after</HI> their return to parliament, let them not have it in their power to excu&s;e their conduct by any nece&s;&s;ity laid upon them <HI>antecedent</HI> to their being returned.</P>
<P>THERE is the more rea&s;on why we, in England, &s;hould watch with care and jealou&s;y over the remains of our civil liberty, becau&s;e the &s;tate of the re&s;t of Eu|rope is &s;o extremely critical and alarming in this re&s;pect. In no part of the world was there ever &s;uch a &s;cene of revolutions as there has been in this. Power has &s;hifted and fluctuated in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner among the different ranks of men, <HI>people, lords, clergy,</HI> and <HI>princes:</HI> But, after almo&s;t all the modes and combina|tions of which the di&s;tribution of power is capable, it has at length almo&s;t wholly, and every where, reverted to the princes: &s;o that they are nearly as arbitrary in Eu|rope as in the Ea&s;t, though e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims and cu&s;|toms (from which re&s;ults, what we call <HI>the &s;pirit of the times</HI>) have hitherto prevented their giving into &s;o wan|ton an <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of their power. But a longer continuance in power may be attended with the&s;e exce&s;&s;es; as was the ca&s;e with the Romans.</P>
<P>IN their in&s;tructive hi&s;tory, we &s;ee as brave and as high-&s;pirited a people as the Engli&s;h, tamely &s;ubmitting to &s;o vile an abu&s;e of power, as one would have thought, <HI>a priori,</HI> had been ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible among men; indeed &s;uch as nothing in the &s;hape of men could be
<PB N="13" REF="013556_0011_0F90F69F30BED608">
trained to bear. And why may not this be the ca&s;e with us? We have already taken the <HI>fir&s;t &s;teps</HI> towards it in the corruption and venality of the lower ranks of the people. Had not they been needy, profligate, and will|ing to &s;ell them&s;elves, Sylla, Cae&s;ar, or Augu&s;tus had never been their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>SUCH, however, is the face of Europe, in all the &s;tates of which the princes were, originally, the farthe&s;t in the world from being arbitrary, that they are now almo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;o. Indeed, not one who bears the name of <HI>king</HI> is excepted, be&s;ides that of Great Britain. And when things &s;hall be equally ripe for it, who can tell but that by a revolution as &s;udden as that of Denmark, or more lately that of Sweden, the very <HI>forms</HI> of our free con&s;titution may be &s;et a&s;ide at once, and undi&s;gui&s;ed de&s;poti&s;m take place. It is no di&s;paragement to the Engli&s;h to &s;ay that they are not more brave or indepen|dent than the Swedes, and it is cerainly not &s;aying le&s;s than the truth, of our princes, to affirm, that like the kings of Sweden, they are <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>SUPPOSING now the three powers of Ru&s;&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Au&s;tria to have completed the partition of Poland, in which they have already made con&s;iderable progre&s;s; nothing will remain but the much-ea&s;ier work of &s;imilar partition of the &s;tates of Switzerland, and of the United Provinces, and de&s;poti&s;m will appear without controul over all the continent of Europe. And &s;hall we flatter our&s;elves that the&s;e i&s;lands will then remain a &s;anctuary for the &s;ons of freedom, and not (after having been the &s;pectators of the progre&s;s of arbitrary power abroad) be|come the la&s;t and mo&s;t dreadful &s;acrifice to it?</P>
<P>THE hope of mankind (who have been &s;o long deba&s;|ed and trampled upon by forms of unequal government) is that, in time, this horrible evil may find its own anti|dote
<PB N="14" REF="013556_0012_0F90F69FF5776C78">
and cure. Kings being always wor&s;e educated than other men, the race of them may be expected to dege|nerate, till they be little better than ideots, as is the ca&s;e already with &s;everal of them, needle&s;s to be named, and it is &s;aid will be the ca&s;e with others, when the pre&s;ent reigning princes &s;hall be no more; while tho&s;e that are not the objects of <HI>contempt,</HI> will be the objects of <HI>hatred and execration.</HI></P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, the temptation to men to a&s;&s;ert their natural rights, and &s;eize the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of freedom, will be very great. And it may be hoped that, enlightened as the world now is with re&s;pect to the theory of government, and taught by the experi|ence of &s;o many pa&s;t ages, they will no more &s;uffer them&s;elves to be transferred, like the live &s;tock of a farm, from one worn out royal line to another, but e&s;tabli&s;h every where forms of free and equal govern|ment; by which at infinitely le&s;s expence than they are now to be <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>abu&s;ed.</HI> every man may be &s;e|cured in the enjoyment of as much of his natural rights as is con&s;i&s;tent with the good of the whole community. If this &s;hould ever be the ca&s;e, even the pa&s;t u&s;urpati|ons of the <HI>Pope</HI> will not excite more a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation, than the pre&s;ent di&s;graceful &s;ubjection of the <HI>many</HI> to the <HI>few</HI> in civil re&s;pects.</P>

<P>AS your late repre&s;entatives have acted as if they were the repre&s;entatives of all North America, and in that a&s;&s;umed capacity have engaged in mea&s;ures which threaten nothing le&s;s than the ruin of the whole&punc;
<PB N="15" REF="013556_0013_0F90F6A0B6F19128">
Briti&s;h empire, it were greatly to be wi&s;hed that their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors might learn by their example to know them|&s;elves better, and keep within their proper province. This is a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much con&s;equence, that I cannot help &s;ubjoining a few plain con&s;iderations relating to it. It is true that I can advance nothing <HI>new</HI> upon the &s;ub|ject&punc; but I &s;hall endeavour to compri&s;e the merits of the ca&s;e in a very &s;mall compa&s;s, which may give it a chance of being better under&s;tood; and &s;ome advantage may ari&s;e from the &s;ame things being &s;aid in a different manner, and upon a different occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE minds of many, indeed, are &s;o ob&s;tinately &s;hut again&s;t conviction, and they are &s;o blindly bent on pu&s;h|ing the vindictive &s;chemes of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, with|out regard to rea&s;on or con&s;equences, that I de&s;pair of making any impre&s;&s;ion upon them. But I wi&s;h to ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who have not yet taken their part, or who, though they may have been deceived by the fal&s;e lights in which this affair has been repre&s;ented, are cool enough to attend to what may be &s;aid on the other &s;ide. On &s;uch I &s;hould think that &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion might be made by <HI>three con&s;iderations;</HI> one drawn from the na|ture and hi&s;tory of our con&s;titution, another from the nature of things and the principles of liberty in general, and the third from the effects which the oppre&s;&s;ion of America may have on the liberties of this country.</P>
<P>IT has ever been a fundamental maxim in our go|vernment, that the repre&s;entatives of the people &s;hould have a voice in enacting all the laws by which they are governed and that they &s;hould have the &s;ole power of giving their own money. Without the&s;e privileges there can be no true Briti&s;h liberty. The&s;e maxims were &s;o well under&s;tood, and were held &s;o inviolable in all for|mer times, that though all the Kings of this country, &s;ince the conque&s;t, have had &s;everal <HI>realms,</HI> or princi|palities
<PB N="16" REF="013556_0014_0F90F6A16E498490">
&s;ubject to them, each has always had its &s;eparate legi&s;lative body, its &s;eparate laws, and its &s;eparate &s;y&s;tem of taxation; and no one of them ever thought of laying a tax upon another.</P>
<P>WHEN the Kings of England were likewi&s;e Dukes of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and held other principalities in France, the Engli&s;h parliament never thought of making laws for the Normans, or the Normans for the Engli&s;h; and &s;till le&s;s did either of them pre&s;ume to tax the other. <HI>Scot|land,</HI> though united under one head with England, had its own &s;y&s;tem of laws, and taxation, altogether inde|pendent of the Engli&s;h, till the union of the parliaments of both the nations. <HI>Wales</HI> al&s;o, and &s;everal <HI>Counties Palatine,</HI> taxed them&s;elves, without any controul from the parliament of England; and &s;o does <HI>Ireland</HI> to this day. So independent were all the&s;e governments of one another, though the &s;ame King had a negative upon the re&s;olutions of them all, that when a man fled from any one of the realms, and took refuge in another, he was as effectually exempted from the juri&s;diction of the country he had left as if he had gone into the dominions of another Prince; &s;o that no proce&s;s at law commenced in the former could affect him.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY to the&s;e ideas, it could not but have been under&s;tood, that when many of our ance&s;tors, the old Puritans, quitted the realm of England, they freed them&s;elves from the laws of England. Indeed they could have had no other motive for leaving this country; and how could they have expected any relief from tak|ing refuge in America, if they had found in that country, or carried with them the &s;ame laws and the &s;ame admi|ni&s;tration by which they were aggrieved in this. But going into a country which was <HI>out of the realm of Eng|land,</HI> and not occupied, they found them&s;elves at fir&s;t without any laws whatever. But they enacted laws for them&s;elves, voluntarily choo&s;ing, from their regard to
<PB N="17" REF="013556_0015_0F90F6A2775FDF70">
the country from which they came, to have the &s;ame common head and center of concord the King of Great Britain, and therefore &s;ubmitted to his negative upon all their proceedings. They adopted as many of the laws of England as they cho&s;e, but no more; and if they had preferred the laws of Scotland, tho&s;e of Ireland, or tho&s;e of any foreign country, they were at liberty to have done it.</P>
<P>THESE Coloni&s;ts al&s;o provided for the expences of their own &s;eparate governments, granting the King aids for that purpo&s;e, according to their own judgment and ability, without the interference of the Engli&s;h parlia|ment, till the fatal period of the <HI>&s;tamp act,</HI> which was ab|&s;olutely an innovation in our con&s;titution, confounding the fir&s;t and fundamental ideas belonging to the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>different realms &s;ubject to the &s;ame King,</HI> and even in|troduced <HI>a language quite new to us;</HI> viz. that of <HI>America being &s;ubject to England.</HI> For America was never thought to be within the realm of England, any more than Scotland or Ireland. If there have been any <HI>ex|ceptions</HI> to this &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation, or taxation, with re&s;pect to America, it has been the exerci&s;e of <HI>tyranny,</HI> and it has not been the le&s;s &s;o for having been <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed,</HI> or having pa&s;&s;ed <HI>without &s;u&s;picion.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to the language that was univer&s;ally in u&s;e till of late years, to &s;ay that <HI>America was &s;ubject to England,</HI> would have been con&s;idered as equally ab&s;urd, with &s;aying, that it was &s;ubject to Ireland or to Hanover, that is, the &s;ubject of &s;ubjects; all being equally &s;ubject to one King who is him&s;elf &s;ubject to the laws, and who is no longer our <HI>legal and rightful King,</HI> than he is &s;o. In this great principle the very e&s;&s;ence of our liberty, and the independent liberty of each part of the <HI>common empire,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, With re&s;pect to the principles of <HI>liberty in general,</HI> I would ob&s;erve, that if any realm or country
<PB N="18" REF="013556_0016_0F90F6A67A3DE598">
be taxed by another, the people &s;o taxed have no proper liberty left, but are in a &s;tate of as <HI>ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m</HI> as any of which we read in hi&s;tory, or of which we can form an idea &s;ince the &s;ame <HI>foreign power</HI> that can take <HI>one penny</HI> from them without their con&s;ent, may take the <HI>la&s;t penny that they have&punc;</HI> &s;o that, in fact, they have <HI>no property at all of their own</HI> every thing they have being at the mercy of others. This would be the ca&s;e with England, if we were taxed at the plea&s;ure of the King, or by the parliament of Ireland, or by the hou&s;es of re|pre&s;entatives of America; it would be the ca&s;e of the Iri&s;h if they were taxed by the Engli&s;h; and therefore it will be the ca&s;e of the Americans if they be taxed by us.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid that Leeds, Manche&s;ter, and other large towns in England, &s;end no repre&s;entatives to parliament, and yet are taxed by it. But there is this very e&s;&s;ential and obvious difference between their ca&s;e and that of the Americans; viz. That tho&s;e who tax Leeds. Manche&s;ter, &amp;c. always tax them&s;elves at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame proportion; and while this is the ca&s;e, tho&s;e towns have no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of partiality or oppre&s;|&s;ion. To make the ca&s;es parallel, let the parliament lay a &s;eparate tax on the towns that &s;end no repre&s;enta|tives, and exempt from &s;uch tax tho&s;e, that do &s;end mem|bers. In this ca&s;e, I doubt not, but the unrepre&s;ented towns would complain as loudly as the Americans do now, who &s;ee that we a&s;&s;ume a power of loading them, and ea&s;ing our&s;elves; and that we are endeavouring to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a <HI>principle,</HI> which will at once give us all the pro|perty they have. If there be in nature a ju&s;tifiable ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance to government, it is this and if the Ame|ricans have any thing of the &s;pirit of Engli&s;hmen, they will ri&s;k every thing, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;uch a claim. They are willing to be our <HI>fellow-&s;ubject;</HI> having the &s;ame common head; but are not willing to be our <HI>&s;laves.</HI></P>
<P>IT is alledged, that we have <HI>protected</HI> the Americans.
<PB N="19" REF="013556_0017_0F90F6A7E1A02780">
and that they ought to pay for that protection: but have we not al&s;o protected Ireland and the electorate of Hano|ver without pretending either to make laws for them or to tax them? what we may do, or <HI>attempt</HI> to do, when this new doctrine &s;hall have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ca&s;e of the Americans, is as yet unknown. Any favour that we do to the Americans certainly gives us a claim upon their <HI>grati|tude&punc;</HI> but it does not make them our &s;laves. Be&s;ides, they have, in many re&s;pects, made abundant requital, and we were actually reaping a rich harve&s;t for the little we have &s;owed in that fruitful &s;oil. But our pre&s;ent mini&s;try re|&s;emble the man who would kill the hen that laid the gold|en eggs, in order that he might come at all the trea&s;ure at once; and the event will equally di&s;appoint them both. Or rather, they re&s;emble the dog, who, by catching at the &s;hadow, lo&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>MANY per&s;ons of this country are &s;o gro&s;sly igno|rant, as to imagine, that while we are heavily taxed for the welfare of the common empire, and have even in|curred a prodigious debt on that account, the Ameri|cans pay nothing at all. But have not the Americans their own &s;eparate governments to &s;upport, as well as we have ours, and do they not tax them&s;elves for that purpo&s;e, and do we help them to bear any part of tho&s;e taxes? If they incur debts, as they &s;ometimes do, do they not di&s;charge them as well as they can? and &s;hould we not laugh at them, if they &s;hould pretend to have any demand upon us for the payment of them? &s;hould we not al&s;o treat the Iri&s;h with the &s;ame contempt in the &s;ame ca&s;e?</P>
<P>IN a <HI>common cau&s;e</HI> the Americans have always been ready to exert them&s;elves with as much zeal as we have &s;hewn; nay, by our own acknowledgement, they have done more. For at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, we volun|tarily voted them large &s;ums of money, becau&s;e we were &s;en&s;ible that they had exerted them&s;elves even beyond
<PB N="20" REF="013556_0018_0F90F6A951479580">
their ability. But their exertions were <HI>voluntary,</HI> as was our acknowledgement.</P>
<P>AS to the conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try with re|&s;pect to America, it is no part of my pre&s;ent argument; but I cannot help ob&s;erving, that it mu&s;t give pain to every rea&s;onable man to &s;ee an Engli&s;h parliament &s;o readily giving their &s;anction to mea&s;ures &s;o exceedingly ab&s;urd and ruinous. Admitting that the Ea&s;t-India company has been injured by &s;ome of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, rea&s;onable people would have contented them|&s;elves with demanding <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> and would not have puni&s;hed the innocent with the guilty, by <HI>blocking up their port.</HI></P>
<P>AN offence of this nature could not in rea&s;on or e|quity draw upon them the <HI>abolition of their charter;</HI> which demon&s;trates, that none of the colonies have the lea&s;t &s;ecurity for &s;o much as the <HI>form</HI> of a free con&s;ti|tution, all being at the mercy of a foreign power.</P>
<P>AN offence of this kind did not require that a fleet of eleven &s;hips of war, and eight regiments &s;hould be &s;ent thither, with a power to commit all crimes and murders with impunity, and that the wretched inhabi|tants &s;hould be compelled, upon every accu&s;ation, to leave their friends, and &s;ubmit to a trial, and con&s;e|quently an iniquitous trial, in a foreign country; an in|&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion which, of it&s;elf, is ab&s;olutely into|lerable, and which it cannot be conceived, that any per&s;on who has arms in his hands, and the &s;pirit of a man within him, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>WHAT man, finding that the government of his country provided him no &s;atisfaction for the murder of a near relation or friend (which will nece&s;&s;arily be the ca&s;e, when a trial cannot be had upon the &s;pot, or with|out cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic ocean, whither he cannot car|ry
<PB N="21" REF="013556_0019_0F90F6A9B612C600">
his witne&s;&s;es, and &s;till le&s;s his <HI>feelings</HI>) will not think him&s;elf not only excu&s;eable, but even bound in con|&s;cience to take his own &s;atisfaction, and engage his pri|vate friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in procuring <HI>blood for blood.</HI></P>
<P>I NEED not a&s;k any <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> how the Ameri|cans (whom prelatical tyranny drove from this country, and who are grown numerous, &s;trong, and high &s;pirited under a very different treatment) mu&s;t feel in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances; e&s;pecially when, at the &s;ame time, they &s;ee the boundaries of Canada extended, and made a perfect arbitrary government, as a model no doubt&punc; for their own, in due time, and a check upon them till that time. It is what he him&s;elf would feel in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Do you imagine, my fellow-citizens, that we can &s;it &s;till, and be the idle &s;pectators of the chains which are forging for our brethren in America, <HI>with &s;afety to our&s;elves?</HI> Let us &s;uppo&s;e America to be com|pleatly en&s;laved, in con&s;equence of which the Engli&s;h court can command all the <HI>money,</HI> and all the <HI>force</HI> of that country; will they like to be &s;o arbitrary <HI>abroad,</HI> and have their power confined <HI>at home?</HI> e&s;pecially as troops in abundance can be tran&s;ported in a few weeks from America to England; where, with the pre&s;ent &s;tanding army, they may in&s;tantly reduce us to what they plea&s;e. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Ameri|cans, being &s;laves them&s;elves, and having been en&s;laved <HI>by us,</HI> will not, in return, willingly contribute their aid to bring us into the &s;ame condition?</P>
<P>THESE con&s;equences appear to me &s;o very obvi|ous, that I think none but the ab&s;olutely <HI>infatuated</HI> can help &s;eeing them. Indeed the infatuation is of &s;o gro&s;s a nature, and of &s;o dangerous a kind, that I cannot help thinking it re&s;embles that, which u&s;ually preceeds the downfall of &s;tates; and it calls to my mind the
<PB N="22" REF="013556_0020_0F90F6AA759D9DD0">
Latin proverb, <HI>Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.</HI></P>
<P>PHILIP the II. and the kingdom of Spain, at the height of its power, &s;o as to threaten Europe with uni|ver&s;al monarchy, were under a like infatuation. That proud and ob&s;tinate prince imagined that he could ea&s;i|ly reduce the Belgic provinces, by writing di&s;patches from his clo&s;et. But the thing that was really effected by all his <HI>orders,</HI> his <HI>generals,</HI> his <HI>fleets,</HI> and his <HI>armies,</HI> after a bloody war of many years, was the independen|cy of tho&s;e provinces, and the ruin of Spain.</P>
<P>WE too affect to &s;peak with the &s;ame contempt of the people of North America, though the di&s;parity of for|ces between Great Britain and them is nothing, com|pared with the apparent di&s;parity between tho&s;e of Spain and the Belgic provinces.</P>
<P>ALSO, becau&s;e the Americans have more of the ap|pearance of religion than our&s;elves, we ridicule them as <HI>hypocrites.</HI> But if they be &s;uch hypocrites as the purita|nical party in England (whom the royali&s;ts diverted them|&s;elves with &s;tigmatizing in the &s;ame manner) in the time of the civil war, true valour and per&s;everance will go hand and hand with their hypocri&s;y; and the hi&s;tory of our approaching conte&s;t will teach mankind the &s;ame le&s;&s;on with our la&s;t, and &s;how the different effects of <HI>&s;o|briety</HI> and <HI>profligacy</HI> in &s;oldiers. The king began with a manife&s;t advantage in point of <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>generals;</HI> and &s;o may we in this war. But it &s;oon appeared that generals and di&s;cipline are more ea&s;ily acquired than <HI>principles;</HI> and in the cour&s;e of two or three years, the &s;uperiority of the parliamentary forces was as great in one re&s;pect as in the other.</P>
<P>TO pur&s;ue this &s;ubject, would carry me far beyond the bounds of my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. I &s;hall therefore return to it, by earne&s;tly advi&s;ing to oppo&s;e, at the next
<PB N="23" REF="013556_0021_0F90F6AB4850D478">
election, every candidate, who, the pre&s;ent parlia|ment, has concurred in the late attrocious attempts to e|&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary power over &s;o great a part of the Briti&s;h empire, to the imminent hazard of our mo&s;t valu|able commerce, and of that national &s;trength, &s;ecurity, and felicity which depend on UNION and on LIBERTY. If you make any <HI>terms</HI> with your future repre&s;entatives, do not forget to require of them, to <HI>do by others as they would have others do by them.</HI> It is only by ju&s;tice, equity, and genero&s;ity that nations, as well as individuals, can ex|pect to flouri&s;h: and by the violation of them, both &s;ingle per&s;ons, and &s;tates, in the cour&s;e of the righteous provi|dence of God, involve them&s;elves in di&s;grace and ruin.</P>
<P>THAT thinking per&s;ons may form &s;ome idea of what we have to expect from a <HI>war with our colonies,</HI> I &s;hall conclude with citing two paragraphs from <HI>Dr. Price's additional Preface to his Appeal to the public, on the Sub|ject of the National Debt.</HI></P>
<P>"Before the Revolution, the &s;upplies of every year were rai&s;ed within the year, by temporary taxes.&mdash;After the Revolution this became too difficult; and money was rai&s;ed by perpetuating and anticipating the taxes, and forming them into funds for di&s;charging the princi|pal and intere&s;t of &s;ums borrowed upon them. But even in this way, &s;ufficient &s;upplies for carrying on King William's and Queen Ann's wars could not have been procured, had it not been for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank. This provided a &s;ub&s;titute for money, which an&s;wered all its purpo&s;es, and enabled the nation to make payments that it could not otherwi&s;e have made."</P>
<P>"FROM that period, paper-credit and taxes have been increa&s;ing together&mdash;When moderate, the&s;e pro|mote trade, by quickning indu&s;try, &s;upplying with a me|dium of traffic, and producing improvements: But when exce&s;&s;ive, they ruin trade, by rendering the means of

&s;ub&s;i&s;tence too dear, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the poor, and rai&s;ing the price of labour, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE poor rate alone is now equal to all the ordinary tax|es formerly; and the expences of <HI>peace</HI> double to tho&s;e of <HI>war</HI> in King William's time.</NOTE> manufactures.&mdash;They are now, among us, in this &s;tate of exce&s;s; and, in conjunction with &s;ome other cau&s;es, have brought us into a &s;ituation, which is, I think, unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of man|kind.&mdash;Hanging on paper, and yet weighed down by heavy burdens. Trade nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to &s;up|port an enormous debt; and yet that debt, together with an exce&s;s of paper money, working continually to|wards the de&s;truction of trade.&mdash;Public &s;pirit, inde|pendency and virtue, undermined by luxury; and yet luxury nece&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence. Other kingdoms have enacted &s;umptuary laws for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing luxury; were we to do this with any con&s;iderable effect, the con|&s;equence might prove fatal. In &s;hort, were our peo|ple to avoid de&s;troying them&s;elves by intemperance, or only to leave off the u&s;e of one or two foreign weeds, the revenue would become deficient, and a public bankruptcy might en&s;ue. On &s;uch grounds it is impo&s;&s;i|ble that any kingdom &s;hould &s;tand long. A dreadful convul&s;ion cannot be very di&s;tant. The next war will &s;carcely leave a chance for e&s;caping it. But we are threatned with it &s;ooner: <HI>An open rupture with our Co|lonies may bring it on immediately."</HI></P>
