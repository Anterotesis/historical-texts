<HEAD>Some brief Hints, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the earne&s;t reque&s;t of many enquiring minds, I have undertaken to pre&s;ent to the public the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter, form, and manner of a new and &s;trange religion, that has lately taken place among many people in the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's, and of New York: and in pur&s;uing my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take the following method:&mdash;</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place&mdash;I will pre&s;ent to view, the leaders and teachers of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. I will &s;hew their manner of addre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. I will &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evi|dence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P N="4">4. I will &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;hall &s;hew the directions which they give to tho&s;e that come to them to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P N="6">6. I will &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructions on their adherents.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;hall &s;hew what this new religion is, as pointed out by &s;cripture te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="8">8. I &s;hall give &s;ome rea&s;ons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere &s;peculation, but by &s;or|rowful experience.</P>
<P N="9">9. I &s;hall clo&s;e the whole, by a word of advice to mi|ni&s;ters and people.</P>
<P>To return therefore according to my promi&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, to pre&s;ent to public view, the leaders and teach|ers of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P>The whole number con&s;i&s;ts of five males and &s;even fe|males; three of the males and two females profe&s;s to be perfect, or to have attained a &s;tate of perfection; the other &s;even not perfect yet, but very far advanced. This peo|ple are Europeans, a part of which came from England to
<PB N="3" REF="017682_0003_0FA21E52F7D07F78">New York in the year 1774, and lived at New York and Albany, and places adjacent, two years&mdash;and in the year 1776, the re&s;t came to Philadelphia, and travelled through Penn&s;ylvania, to New-York, where the whole twelve came together and directly went and made a purcha&s;e of land in a place called Ni&s;queunia, about nine or ten miles northwe&s;t from Albany, where they immediately &s;ettled, and went to clearing their land, and following their &s;everal occupations of black&s;mithing, weaving and &s;hoe making, and were un|known and unnoticed, unle&s;s by a few of their neighbours, until the 17th day of April 1780; at which time, one Talmage Bi&s;hop brought tidings into New Lebanon, of a number of &s;trange and wonderful Chri&s;tians; the people, like the Athenians of old, were filled with de&s;ire to &s;ee new things, and run to &s;ee them. This brings me to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">2d. Their manner of addre&s;s &mdash;</P>
<P>When any per&s;on goes to &s;ee them, they all meet him with many &s;miles, and &s;eeming great gladne&s;s; they bid him welcome, and directly tell him they knew of his com|ing ye&s;terday. This &s;ets the per&s;on a wondering at their knowledge, and pre&s;ently they get the per&s;on &s;ome victu|als; then they &s;it down and have a &s;pell of &s;inging; they &s;ing odd tunes, and Briti&s;h marches, &s;ometimes without words, and &s;ometimes with a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ure of words known and unknown. After &s;inging they fall to &s;haking their heads in a very extraordinary manner with their eyes &s;hut and face up; then a woman about forty years old &s;its &amp; makes a fare of prayer, chiefly in an unknown tongue, (if I may &s;o call it) then one of the men comes to the per&s;on and pretends to interpret the woman's prayer; after which they tell the per&s;on he has come to the light place to be in&s;tructed; they inquire the per&s;on's name, and ever after call him by his Chri&s;tian name; they u&s;e no compliments, but their language is, <HI>yea</HI> and <HI>nay.</HI> If the per&s;on have long hair, or a club, they bring the bible, and read to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cor. xith chap and 14th ver&s;e, then telling him if he intends to be in&s;tructed, he mu&s;t fir&s;t have his hair cut &s;hort; telling of him that he wears the mark of the bea&s;t. If he con&s;ents to have his hair cut, after it is done, they
<PB N="4" REF="017682_0004_0FA21E540B80A420">come round him and touch him with their fingers here and there and give him a &s;ly cro&s;s, and in a very loving way put their hands on his head and then begin to preach their doctrine to him. But this leads me to enter on the third thing propo&s;ed viz.</P>
<P N="3">3 To &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evidence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P>They introduce their doctrine with a multitude of good words; &s;aying, we mu&s;t hate &s;in, love GOD, take up our cro&s;s &amp;c. Then proceed to &s;ay, in the fir&s;t place, that there is a new di&s;pen&s;ation taking place, in which the &s;aints &s;hall reign a thou&s;and years with Chri&s;t, and that in that &s;tate the &s;ains &s;hall be perfect, and that they have entered into it and that they are the only church in the world; telling the per&s;on or hearer, that they have all the apo&s;tolic gifts that were ever given; then they tell the per&s;on that he has come to the right place for in&s;truction, for they only are able to teach; then they pau&s;e a while to &s;ee how the per&s;on receives it, if they find he li&s;tens, and &s;eems to be coming, they proceed and &s;ay, all the churches now in the world are antichri&s;t, and fal&s;e churches, and that there is not one per&s;on born again among them all, and that there has not one gone to heaven for the&s;e twelve hundred years, no, not &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age. If the per&s;on makes any objections, they tell him he mu&s;t not di&s;pute, his bu&s;ine&s;s is to hear and receive in&s;truction, and all hands will fall to confirming the truth of what is declared: This puts the per&s;on to &s;ilence, &amp; then they proceed, with a great laugh, and tell him they have many things to &s;ay to him, which he is not yet able to bear; this is to engage the per&s;on to hear. Then, &s;econdly, they proceed to &s;ay, that all exter|nal ordinances, e&s;pecially bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, cea&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic age; and that GOD has never &s;ent one man to preach, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, until they en|tered into the new di&s;pen&s;ation, and were &s;ent by GOD from Great Britain, to call in GOD's elect; and to confirm the truth of what the teacher has &s;aid, he (the teacher) falls a trembling, and will &s;ay he feels the blood of Chri&s;t, now running down his thigh and leg. Then they tell the per|&s;on
<PB N="5" REF="017682_0005_0FA21E549AC42858">he can't bear any more now, but he mu&s;t come again very &s;oon and they will tell him more; and thus they with many fawning embraces, part with him for that time.</P>
<P N="3">3 When he comes again then meet him with great joy, cla&s;p him in their arms, and tell him they have the great love of Gon; and after things are a little &s;ettled, they be|gin with him again, telling him that he mu&s;t confe&s;s his fins to them, from his childhood, that they may take his ca&s;e, and travail for him, that he may be born again. If he be a profe&s;&s;or of godline&s;s, and pleads that he hopes his fins are forgiven, and wa&s;h'd away by the blood of Chri&s;t; they tell him nay, they are not forgiven. They tell him what&s;oever is done in &s;ecret, mu&s;t be revealed on the hou&s;e top: And that they being the church, are the hou&s;e top. Then one takes him alone, and if he confe&s;&s;es his fin to him, then he tells it to the re&s;t: But if it be &s;u&s;pected that he keeps back part of his fin, he mu&s;t confe&s;s the whole, all being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. They tell him that they &s;ee angels, and conver&s;e with them, and hear them &s;ing, and &s;ing with them; and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, they al&s;o freely conver&s;e with. They further tell him, the &s;ong that they &s;ing, is the &s;ong of the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which no man can learn, but only tho&s;e that are redeemed from the earth. Then tell him, they have got a mother; pointing to a woman, one of their company: And that &s;he &s;peaks &s;eventy two tongues, and that when &s;he &s;peaks in unknown tongues, the living people cannot under&s;tand her; yet the dead under&s;tand her, for &s;he talks to them.</P>
<P N="5">5. They proceed and &s;ay, the judgment is &s;et, the books are opened, and the dead are now ri&s;ing, and coming to judgment, and they are &s;et to judge the world: Quoting 1 Cor. vi. chap. 2 ver&s;e. They tell the per&s;on, that the great tribunal is that church, and that the dead are co|ming before them every day to be judged. They go on to &s;ay all that have died in an imperfect &s;tate, have gone to hell, or to a pri&s;on &s;tate; and there to pay the debt to di|vine ju&s;tice, by &s;uffering; and that there are degrees of puni&s;hment, which they are to pa&s;s through; great fins, a
<PB N="6" REF="017682_0006_0FA21E5596BEDC58">great degree of hell, &s;mall fins, a &s;mall hell; And after pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;everal degrees of puni&s;hment, &amp; pay|ing the whole debt, out they come, and &s;tand before us, (&s;ay they) and are acquitted, and go home to heaven; they quote for proof, P&s;al. xvi. 10. P&s;al. lxviii. 18. Eze|kiel xvi. 44&mdash;61. 1 Peter, iii 18, 19, 20. 1 Peter, iv. 6.</P>
<P>They comment on tho&s;e texts thus: Did Chri&s;t go to hell? Yes. When? Why when he was crucified. What did he go there for? Why, to preach to the &s;pirits in pri|&s;on. What did he preach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them? Why the go&s;pel. Why did he preach the go&s;pel to the old world, or to the dead? Why that they might be judged as unconverted &s;inners, but finally live, according to GOD in the &s;pirit, after they have paid the debt in &s;uffering.</P>
<P N="6">6. They &s;ay, that the forecited woman, about forty years of age, is the woman &s;poken of in the xiith chapter of the Revelations of John, who was clothed with the &s;un, having the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve &s;tars; and that &s;he has travail'd and bro't forth the man child. Further, that &s;he is the mother of all the elect; and that &s;he travails for the whole world; and that no ble&s;&s;ing can come to any per&s;on, but only by and through her; and that in the way of her being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;ins, by their confe&s;&s;ing of them, and repenting of the fame, one by one, according to her direction.</P>
<P N="7">7. They hold them&s;elves &s;o far immortal, that they &s;hall never die, but &s;hall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and go from this to the upper regions; and that now, they are above all temptations and &s;ufferings, and can nei|ther be lifted up or ca&s;t down; only as they &s;uffer in tra|vail for the elect. I might &s;till proceed much further on this head; but as it will nece&s;&s;arily fall into their in&s;truc|tions to their adherents, I pa&s;s by it for the pre&s;ent, and &s;hall proceed,</P>
<P N="4">4. To &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip (if it may be &s;o called)</P>
<P>The manner and form of their wor&s;hip is entirely new, and different from all others: It differs but little on the Sabbath from any other day: They begin by sitting down
<PB N="7" REF="017682_0007_0FA21E55F7D75190">and &s;hocking their heads in a violent manner, turning their heads half round, &s;o that their face looks over each &s;houl|der, their eyes being &s;hut; while they are thus &s;haking, one will begin to &s;ing &s;ome odd tune, without words or rule; after a while another will &s;trike in; and then ano|ther; and after a while they all fall in and make a &s;trange charm:&mdash;Some &s;inging without words, and &s;ome with an unknown tongue, or mutter, and &s;ome with a mixture of Engli&s;h: The mother, &s;o called, minds to &s;trike &s;uch notes as makes a concord, and &s;o form the charm. When they leave off &s;inging, they drop off, one by one, as oddly as they come on; in the be&s;t part of their wor&s;hip, every one acts for him&s;elf, and almo&s;t every one different from the other; one will &s;tand with his arms extended acting over odd po&s;tures, which they call &s;igns; another will be danc|ing, and &s;ometimes hopping on one leg about the floor; another will fall to turning round &s;o &s;wift, that if it be a woman, her clothes will be &s;o filled with the wind, as tho' they ware kept out by a hoop; another will be pro&s;trate on the floor; another will be talking with &s;omebody; and &s;ome fitting by &s;moaking their pipes; &s;ome groaning mo&s;t di&s;mally; &s;ome trembling extremely; others acting as tho' all their nerves were convuls'd; others &s;winging their arms with all vigour, as though they were turning a wheel, &amp;c. Then all break off and have a &s;pell of &s;moaking, and &s;ome|times great fits of laughter.&mdash;They have &s;everal &s;uch ex|erci&s;es in a day e&s;pecially on the Sabbath. When they go to eat, they fit down, and have a &s;pell of &s;inging and &s;haking the head at the table, before they eat; &s;ometimes they kneel down, &s;hake their heads and groan, &s;ay nothing, and then fall to eating, and will be very merry and airy. If one has done eating before the re&s;t, he kneels down, &s;hakes his head a &s;pell, and off he goes and leaves the re&s;t eating; &s;o each one di&s;mi&s;&s;es the table for him&s;elf: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to point out any exact form; for they vary and differ, and &s;eldom act the &s;ome form exactly over a|gain. They chu&s;e &s;o to do, to be &s;ingular, le&s;t, as they &s;ay, they &s;hould be connected with Babylon. Every day their wor&s;hip is &s;imilar to what has been ob&s;erved. They
<PB N="8" REF="017682_0008_0FA21E56E2ED0A40">have no public prayer, no preaching, and but little read|ing. Their actions in wor&s;hip is according to the dictates of the &s;pirit that governs them; then they profe&s;s, faying, they are in a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn as far as may be, their manner of wor&s;hip, I proceed 5thly, to &s;how the directions which they give to tho&s;e that come to them to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on goes to them to be in&s;tructed, they enquire of him, whether he has given his vote and money for the defence of the country, and pre&s;ently tell him it is contrary to the go&s;pel to bear arms, &s;aying Chri&s;t's kingdom has not of this world; they labor to convince him that it is a great error to have any thing to do with war and fighting: they directly tell him, he is not born a|gain, and that he mu&s;t ob&s;erve their in&s;tructions in order that he may attain to the new birth &mdash; Then they tell him, he mu&s;t confe&s;s his &s;in to them; for if he hides his &s;in, they can do nothing for him: They further tell him, if he refu&s;es, they can tell him all his &s;in that he ever committed; and pretend that he can keep nothing hid from them; and when they have frightened him to a confe&s;&s;ion then they further tell him, he mu&s;t renounce and ab&s;tain from all the works of the fle&s;h; telling him, that the fir&s;t fall of our fir&s;t parents, was carnal copula|tion, and that this ruined the world; and that every one that has any thing to do with man or women in the work of generation, is acting Adam and Eve's &s;in over again: They tell the man to ab&s;tain from his wife, the woman from her hu&s;band, and that if the wife doth not agree to it, the hu&s;band mu&s;t put her away; and if the hu&s;band will not agree to it, the wife mu&s;t leave her hu&s;|band; and for an example, the mother, &s;o cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, did tell how &s;he left her hu&s;band, in New York and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the men, how he left his wife in England. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> young men and young women if they marry, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve any thing to do with the works or lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of the fle&s;h they can never be born again: They &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of re|ceiving this in&s;truction, by quoting Rev. iii. 3. 4. 5. They dwell more on this part of their in&s;tructions than
<PB N="9" REF="017682_0009_0FA21E5786D78E70">all the re&s;t. They tell their adherents, if they conform to their in&s;tructions in this point, there is no &s;ear of their being born again; but if they di&s;obey they certainly will be damned. While they are thus in&s;tructing their adhe|rents, they &s;ometimes u&s;e great &s;everity, and &s;ometimes, great flattery, to frighten on the one hand and allure on the other; and while they are thus at work with a per|&s;on, they come round him, touch him with their &s;ingers in different places, cre&s;s him here and there, get their hand on his head, and prophecy, that great ble&s;&s;ings are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid up for him: They pre&s;ently make him believe them, and as &s;oon as they &s;ee the &s;pirit begin to operate on him, then they tell him, that now he has received the Holy Gho&s;t, and now if he di&s;obeys, it is a gone ca&s;e with him: They tell him, if he had never come to &s;ee them, and had died in his ignorance without receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, he would have gone to hell or a pri&s;on &s;tate, and &s;uffered a while, and then come out and gone to heaven; but now, if he turns back, there is no forgivene&s;s, neither in this world, nor that which is to come; They quote for proof. Matt. xii .32. This is to terrify the per&s;on, and bring him into an ab&s;olute dependence on them: Then they tell him, he mu&s;t come often to them to be in&s;tructed, or he will be in danger of being taken by evil &s;pirits and bed wrong; and that he mu&s;t not think he can under&s;tand the bible, or know in any re&s;pect how to act, but only as he receives in&s;truction from them: They tell him they have many things for him, which he is not yet able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but as fa&s;t as he is able to receive it, they &s;hall in&s;truct him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Thus the per&s;on is kept in con&s;tant expectation of &s;ome|thing new. If the per&s;on &s;eems to be &s;ober, then one takes him by the hand, and round the floor with him, and make him run and &s;kip about, and laugh heartily at him, and will tell him he mu&s;t not be melancholy; and when they get him merry with them, then let him go: Then they tell the per&s;on, for his admiration, that &s;ince he has been pre&s;ent they have had many of the dead come before them to be judged; and make him believe they know his that's, and know &s;uture events, and nothing can be hid from them; telling how people are together, and talking about
<PB N="10" REF="017682_0010_0FA21E5A01197A98">them, and what they &s;ay, &amp;c. Then they tell the per&s;on that they &s;hall never die, and al&s;o all tho&s;e that obey them, and get to be perfect, &s;hall never die, but be changed in a moment, and go home body and &s;oul: But all the bodies of more than are in their &s;ins, &s;hall never ri&s;e.&mdash;They fur|ther tell him, that the hundred and forty and four thou|&s;and, which were &s;ealed; twelve thou&s;and out of each tribe, is a work yet to be done; and that they are of the tribe of Benjamin, though the younge&s;t tribe, and la&s;t in the account, yet fir&s;t in the order of being &s;ealed; and that they are the fir&s;t fruits of that tribe; and that all that are to be brought in in America, will belong to that tribe: And thus, the la&s;t is to be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t la&s;t.</P>
<P>I might &s;till proceed, on this head; but it would be endle&s;s to repeat all their in&s;tructions to their adherents, as they are ever &s;tudying new things to keep up the de|pendence and admiration of their di&s;ciples. I &s;hall there|fore pa&s;s on:</P>
<P N="6">6thly, To &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructi|ons on their adherents.</P>
<P>There is a very extraordinary and uncommon power attends their in&s;tructions; in the fir&s;t place, a total blind|ne&s;s, as to all their former views, of religion and the bi|ble, on the in&s;tructed, takes place; and then a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in|fatuation of the mind, to believe all their teachers &s;ay.&mdash;Pre&s;ently, a &s;trange power begins to come on, and takes place in the body, or human frame, which &s;ets the per&s;on a gaping and &s;tretching; and &s;oon &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> him a twitching, as though his nerves were all in a convul&s;ion. I can com|pare it to nothing nearer in its feelings than the operation of an clecteri&s;ing machine; the per&s;on believes it is the power of GOD, and therefore dare not re&s;i&s;t, but wholly gives way to it.&mdash;Thus the power comes on, more and more; and as the power increa&s;es, &s;o their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> increa&s;es, in their teachers. If any body oppo&s;es them it brings on the power quick, &s;trong and violent; and they cry out, on the oppo&s;er, that he will be damn'd for oppo&s;ing the power of GOD; and fall to twitching and trembling as though they had an extreme fit of the ague. This power as it increa&s;es, brings on, many times, extreme weakne&s;s

<P>It is very evident, that this is the very day in which this work of Satan is on the wheel: And notwith&s;tanding, it may appear unaccountable to every rational mind, that any of the human &s;pecie &s;hould fall in with &s;o diabolical a &s;cheme; yet when we con&s;ider i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fine dre&s;s of perfection, and the &s;pirit of infatuation, and witchcra&s;t, that attends it, it may form our minds into a belief, that it can be and really is &s;o.</P>
<P>It is further evident, that Antichri&s;t cannot appear in any other light or path, but only that which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles have marked out for it.&mdash;I will therefore compare the works and character of Antichri&s;t with this new and &s;trange religion, as it is delineated and &s;et forth.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, iii. 1-9 points out this very people, in this new religion, and &s;hew they were to appear in the la&s;t day, bearing the character of GOD's enemies. Again, in 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. The Holy Gho&s;t points out the doctrines of this new reli|gion, and calls them the doctrines of devils, which are taught them by &s;educing &s;pirits. Again, 2 Pet. ii 1, 2, 3. Their here&s;ies are &s;poken of, and of their denying the Lord that bought them. Nothing is more evident then, that the apo&s;tle points out this very people, for they throw away their conver&s;ion and begin to repent of their &s;in which they committed in their childhood; and thus to atone and make &s;atisfaction, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> own works into a &s;tate of perfection; but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;hould overtake them before they get to be perfect, then down to hell they mu&s;t go, to pay the remainder in &s;uffering and when they have paid the debt and are born again in hell,

Another thing which proves this new religion to be fal&s;e, is what follows&mdash;The apo&s;tle James, in his epi&s;tle i. 5. &s;ays.

But this people go to Ni&s;queunia, to a&s;k of a number of Europeans, what they &s;hall do?&mdash;who tell them, agreeable to what I find 2d Peter, ii. 18 19. They &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity, and allure thro' their much wantonne&s;s, tho&s;e that were clean e&s;ca|ped from them who live in error; and while they promi&s;ed them liberty, they them&s;elves are the &s;ervants of corrup|tion.&mdash;And further, in&s;tead of attending to the worthy in|&s;tructions of our Godly teachers, they are burning all the books of divinity and learning, they come at.&mdash;In this new religion, is the whole magazine of error, trea&s;ured up in the great my&s;tery of iniquity, in which is found all the power of delu&s;ive witchcraft, to blindfold &s;ouls and lead them to hell.

After they had been the object of attention for &s;ome time, I turned my thoughts on my former views of religi|on, and found, to my admiration, my mind was turned wholly up&s;ide down; and began to think I had been all my life in a dream about religion&mdash;After a further di&s;co|very of their wor&s;hip, I felt greatly &s;hocked and confound|ed; yet a &s;ecret belief kept prevailing, that they were the people of GOD.

<P>In a very &s;hort time I found a power come on me, diffe|rent from what ever I had felt before, and made me feel very weak and maugre, and in a little time it &s;o affected my nerves, that they gave a twitch, as &s;udden as a fla&s;h of lightning; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t I thought, what can that be?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS God has called you to the great and arduous work
<PB N="21" REF="017682_0021_0FA21E62654AF770">of the mini&s;try, to teach the way of life, and watch over &s;ouls; it becomes my duty to adverti&s;e you of the grow|ing evils and dangerous errors that are prevailing in our land, that by a timely information you may be able to guard again&s;t tho&s;e damnable here&s;ies, abominable impie|ties, and horrible bla&s;phemies, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted out in this piece.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my bleeding country, the burthen of war, and want of religion, it may ju&s;tly &s;erve, as a &s;trong motive, to engage every true lover of God and his country, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to pro|mote the union, peace and tranquility of the people in the civil &s;tate, and to quicken all into action, in the great and momentous concerns of eternity &mdash; While the infernal de|&s;igns of an unwearied enemy are ripening into action, in leading &s;ouls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;truction, by delu&s;ive charms, it becomes your duty to u&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ur utmo&s;t exertions to prevent their ca|lamitous &s;hipwreck, by the overflowing deluge of an infi|finite brood of evils.</P>
<P>The great and glorious doctrines of the go&s;pel are in|tended as a &s;acred barrier again&s;t bewitching error: O then endeavour to inculcate in the minds of your hearers, the great mediator&s;hip of Chri&s;t&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of regene|rating grace, and a divine faith in God, through the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and to main|tain practical Godline&s;s, by carefully and clo&s;ely attending and adhering to every divine requirement.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Sirs,</HI></P>
<P>THERE never was a day that more loudly called for faithful watchmen, than the pre&s;ent time; while we &s;ee Satan transforming him&s;elf into an angel of light, and bringing forward his deep laid &s;cheme, to undermine the glorious plan of Redemption by Chri&s;t: And as he at fir&s;t deceived the woman, and made u&s;e of her to delude the man, &s;o he is playing his old prank over again, &s;ending one woman from the State of New York, and another from the State of Rhode I&s;land, who vie with each other, and are as dangerous to the heedle&s;s pa&s;&s;enger as Scylla and Charybdes are to the un&s;kilful mariner. O then! what need is there of &s;kilful pilots and experienced helm&s;|men, to &s;teer the &s;hip of Zion, and keep her in the true channel of faith and love to GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="017682_0022_0FA21E62B8366950">
The battle is now begun, Michael and his angels, and the dragon and his angels, are now formed one again&s;t the other, for the grand deci&s;ion. Now we may expect the whole artillery of the infernal den, charged with error, delu&s;ion and bla&s;phemy, attended with all the power of helli&s;h fury, in the la&s;t &s;truggle of the enemy.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, you are to fight again&s;t all the powers of darkne&s;s, and with&s;tand Satan, not only in his malig|nant rage and envy, but al&s;o in his deceitful flatteries and counterfeit friend&s;hip. For the old enemy of GOD and his people, like a grand politician, will try every method, by power, fraud &amp; lies, to carry his diabolical de&s;igns into execution. You need therefore the whole armour of GOD, that you may be able to with&s;tand and having done all to &s;tand; but there is no fear to them that put their tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, who will again come up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the fields of Edom, glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength, and will trample his enemies in his fury, and &s;prinkle his garments with the blood of his enemies. You know your leader and where your &s;trength lies; it is your duty to attend clo&s;ely to his directions that you may be powerful in your warfare, to pul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> down the &s;trong holds of &s;in and Satan, and in &s;o doing &s;ave your&s;elves and them that hear you, and at la&s;t receive a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give at that day.</P>
<P>Dear Fathers in Chri&s;t, I clo&s;e my addre&s;s to you, by wi&s;hing you the ble&s;&s;ings of GOD in your pious labours to promote religion and virtue, and the advancement of the Redermer's kingdom. I commend you to GOD, and the power of his grace, who is able to make you &s;ucce&s;sful in building up your churches in the mo&s;t holy faith, and at la&s;t to give you all an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>I now turn my&s;elf to the people in general. My dear countrymen, I am deeply affected at the fearful omens of impending de&s;truction that &s;o loudly threaten our bleeding land. Surely GOD is angry, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">okens of his di&s;|plea&s;ure are plainly di&s;covered. It is a day that calls for lamentation and mourning, repentance and reformation; it is for our &s;in that GOD has permitted the &s;word to be
<PB N="23" REF="017682_0023_0FA21E64430BE840">un&s;heathed upon us; and tyranny to clank its chains and threaten us with &s;lavery. Notwith&s;tanding it was our duty to look to GOD for help, and in an humble dependance on him, to &s;tand forth in our defence, again&s;t a cruel ene|my; yet how has our armies degenerated into nur&s;eries of impiety, and the contagious di&s;temper that we have been oppo&s;ing, &s;pread it&s;elf in our land? Vice and immorality abounds; &s;tupidity and prophane&s;s prevails; ambition and di&s;cord has been a growing evil; and how many of our countrymen, lo&s;t to the tender feelings of the human heart, been found more cruel than the O&s;trich. How ma|ny traiterous plans have been formed for our blood and trea&s;ure, by a banditti of infernal mi&s;creants? And not|with&s;tanding GOD has prevented, and his good providence bla&s;ted the de&s;igns of tho&s;e Cain's and Judas's, that have combin'd again&s;t us, yet how have we forgot the danger, without being found in &s;uitable returns to GOD.</P>
<P>The great enemy of GOD that has filled the world with uproar, war and death, has ever envied the recovery of man by a glorious Mediator; and has ever been trying to circumvent the merciful de&s;igns of GOD, through Chri&s;t, for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. And in addition to all his &s;ubtil wiles he takes the advantage of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y of religion and virtue, and makes it his opportunity to play his magic games attended with the doctrine of purgatory, the wor|&s;hip of the creature in&s;tead of the Creator, and an earthly and creature tribunal, to bring the whole creation of men to trial. The &s;cheme is &s;o naked and ball'd, with all its &s;plendid &s;hew of perfection, that every rational mind would recoil at the thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lling in with &s;uch a dia|bolical plan, was it not for a bewitching power that at|tends it, which turns every thing up&s;ide down, and puts darkne&s;s for light, error for truth, bitter for &s;weet, and hell for heaven.</P>
<P>Multitudes have fallen in with this dreadful &s;cheme, and are &s;o infatuated in their &s;en&s;es that they are depri|ved of their rea&s;on, and pa&s;t recovery unle&s;s GOD inter|po&s;e for them. While the leaders of this dreadful cata&s;|trophe, like the bowels of Aetna, are ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ing up their &s;ulphur; like wild-fire it flies, and catches at a di&s;|tance,
<PB N="24" REF="017682_0024_0FA21E64F8A995B0">and &s;preads like a plague. For &s;uch a delu&s;ion to take place in the land, loudly proclaims the judgment of GOD. For a people to be carried away with the power of error, be&s;peaks their great darkne&s;s and ignorance of the truth.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren and Fathers, &s;uffer me to addre&s;s you with a word of advice. One great end and de&s;ign of this piece is to timely adverti&s;e you of the growing evils that are prevailing in our land, e&s;pecially the fatal delu&s;ion &s;et forth in this narrative. Con&s;ider the great and noble end of your creation. You were not made to be the meer play|things of time, nor to furni&s;h Satan with materials to carry on his dark de&s;igns and horrid intreagnes again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, but to honor and glorify GOD. Therefore, for this great end and purpo&s;e, break off from &s;in of every kind, encourage religion and virtue in each other; care|fully attend to the dectrine and advice of your godly teach|ers; li&s;t up your hearts in your de&s;ires to GOD, for his holy &s;pirit to enlighten and lead you into the truth; clo&s;e|ly attend to the word of GOD, make it the man of your coun&s;el. Let all your conduct &s;peak forth your belief of the Deity, and judgment to come; and by becoming holy we &s;hall be a happy people, and &s;hall &s;ee the return of GOD's ble&s;&s;ings, Satan di&s;appointed and bla&s;ted, and the glorious kingdom of Chri&s;t advancing. I clo&s;e my ad|dre&s;s to you, by heartily recommending to your &s;erious con|&s;ideration the great duty of guarding again&s;t tho&s;e dange|rous errors, and de&s;tructive delu&s;ions, which lead the mi&s;|guided &s;oul into the endle&s;s mazes and winding labyrinths of trouble and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>And may GOD pre&s;erve you and lead you to him&s;elf, through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with which I clo&s;e, and &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf the public's real friend and humble &s;ervant,</P>
