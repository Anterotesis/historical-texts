<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed letter contains the rea&s;ons of his Excellency Governor Randolph for refu&s;ing his &s;ig|nature to the propo&s;ed Foederal Con&s;titution of Go|vernment &s;ubmitted to the &s;everal &s;tates by the late Convention at Philadelphia. The manner in which we have obtained it, and the authority by which we convey it to the Public, through the channel of your Pre&s;s, will be explained by the letter herewith &s;ent to you, which, we reque&s;t may precede his Excellency's letter to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Delegates in your publication of them.</P>

<P><HI>IT</HI> has been reported in various parts of the &s;tate, that the rea&s;ons which governed you in your di&s;approbation of the propo&s;ed Foederal Con&s;titution, no longer exi&s;t; and many of the people of this Commonwealth have wi&s;hed to know what objections could induce you to refu&s;e your &s;ignature to a mea&s;ure &s;o flattering to many principal characters in Ame|rica, and which is &s;o generally &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the &s;eeds of pro&s;perity and happine&s;s to the United States.</P>

<P><HI>YOUR</HI> favor of the &s;econd in&s;tant, reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to publi&s;h my letter on the new Con&s;titution, gives me an opportunity of making known my &s;entiments, which, per|haps I ought not to decline. It has been written ever &s;ince its date, and was intended for the General A&s;&s;embly.

<HEAD>A LETTER OF HIS EXCELLENCY EDMUND RANDOLPH, ESQUIRE, ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>RICHMOND,
<DATE>OCTOBER 10, 1787.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Con&s;titution, which I inclo&s;ed to the General A&s;|&s;embly in a late official letter, appears without my &s;ignature. This circum&s;tance, although trivial in its own nature, has been rendered rather important to my&s;elf at lea&s;t, by being mi&s;under&s;tood by &s;ome, and mi&s;repre&s;ented by others &mdash;As I di&s;dain to conceal the rea&s;ons for with-holding my &s;ub&s;cription, I have always been, &s;till am, and ever &s;hall be, ready to proclaim them to the world. To the legi&s;lature therefore, by whom I was deputed to the Foederal Conven|tion, I beg leave now to addre&s;s them; affecting no indif|ference to public opinion, but re&s;olved not to court it by an unmanly &s;acrifice of my own judgment.</P>
<P>As this explanation will involve a &s;ummary, but general review of our foederal &s;ituation, you will pardon me, I tru&s;t, although I &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s the u&s;ual bounds of a letter.</P>
<P>Before my departure for the Convention, I believed, that the confederation was not &s;o eminently defective, as it had been &s;uppo&s;ed. But after I had entered into a free commu|nication with tho&s;e, who were be&s;t informed of the condition and intere&s;t of each &s;tate; after I had compared the intelli|gence derived from them, with the properties which ought to characterize the government of our union, I became per&s;uad|ed, that the confederation was de&s;titute of every energy, which a con&s;titution of the United States ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>For the objects propo&s;ed by its in&s;titution were, that it &s;hould be a &s;hield again&s;t foreign ho&s;tility, and a firm re&s;ort again&s;t dome&s;tic commotion: that it &s;hould cheri&s;h trade, and promote the pro&s;perity of the &s;tates under its care.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not among the attributes of our pre&s;ent uni|on. Severe experience under the pre&s;&s;ure of war&mdash;a ruinous weakne&s;s, manife&s;ted &s;ince the return of peace&mdash;and the con|templation
<PB N="4" REF="020669_0004_0FB0A8835B9E4448">
of tho&s;e dangers, which darken the future pro&s;|pect, have condemned the hope of grandeur and of &s;afety under the au&s;pices of the confederation.</P>
<P>In the exigencies of war indeed the hi&s;tory of its effects is &s;hort; the final ratification having been delayed until the beginning of the year 1781. But how&s;oever &s;hort, this period is di&s;tingui&s;hed by melancholy te&s;timonies, of its inability to maintain in harmony the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of the &s;tates, to defend Congre&s;s again&s;t incroachments on their rights, and to obtain by requi&s;itions &s;upplies to the foederal trea&s;ury or recruits to the foederal armies. I &s;hall not attempt an enu|meration of the particular in&s;tances; but leave to your own remembrance and the records of Congre&s;s, the &s;upport of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>In the &s;ea&s;on of peace too not many years have elap&s;ed; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delin|quency, and &s;ometimes of pointed oppo&s;ition to foederal du|ties. To the various remon&s;trances of Congre&s;s I appeal for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the injuries, which our faith, honor and happine&s;s have &s;u&s;tained by the failures of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>But the&s;e evils are pa&s;t; and &s;ome may be lead by an ho|ne&s;t zeal to conclude, that they cannot be repeated. Yes, &s;ir; they will be repeated as long as the confederation exi&s;ts, and will bring with them other mi&s;chiefs, &s;pringing from the &s;ame &s;ource, which cannot be yet fore&s;een in their full array of terror.</P>
<P>If we examine the con&s;titutions, and laws of the &s;everal &s;tates, it is immediately di&s;covered, that the law of nations is unprovided with &s;anctions in many ca&s;es, which deeply affect public dignity and public ju&s;tice. The letter, how|ever of the confederation does not permit Congre&s;s to reme|dy the&s;e defects, and &s;uch an authority, although evidently deducible from its &s;pirit, cannot, without a violation of the &s;econd article, be a&s;&s;umed. Is it not a political phaenome|non, that the head of the confederacy &s;hould be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences again&s;t this law? And &s;entenced to witne&s;s in un|availing angui&s;h the infraction of their engagements to fo|reign &s;overeigns?</P>
<P>And yet this is not the only grievous point of weakne&s;s. After a war &s;hall be inevitable, the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s for quotas of men or money, will again prove unproductive and fallacious. Two cau&s;es will always con&s;pire to this baneful con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="020669_0005_0FB0A88811F941E0">1. No government can be &s;table, which hangs on human inclination alone, unbia&s;&s;ed by the fear of coercion; and 2. from the very connection between &s;tates bound to pro|portionate contributions,&mdash;jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions naturally ari&s;e, which at lea&s;t chill the ardor, if they do not excite the murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by one &s;udden impul&s;e our part of the American continent has both thrown into a military po&s;ture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere re|commendations of Congre&s;s But ought we to argue from a conte&s;t, thus &s;ignalized by the magnitude of its &s;take, that as often as a flame &s;hall be hereafter kindled, the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m will fill our legions? or renew them, as they may be thined by lo&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>If not, where &s;hall we find protection? Impre&s;&s;ions, like tho&s;e, which prevent a compliance with requi&s;itions of regu|lar forces, will deprive the American republic of the &s;ervices of militia. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that they are attainable, and acknowledge, as I always &s;hall, that they are the natural &s;up|port of a free government. When it is remembered, that in their ab&s;ence agriculture mu&s;t langui&s;h; that they are not habituated to military expo&s;ures and the rigor of military di&s;cipline, and that the nece&s;&s;ity of holding in readine&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive detachments, carries the expence far beyond that of in|li&s;tments&mdash;this re&s;ource ought to be adopted with caution.</P>
<P>As &s;trongly too am I per&s;uaded, that requi&s;itions for mo|ney will not be more cordially received. For be&s;ides the di&s;tru&s;t, which would prevail with re&s;pect to them al&s;o; be|&s;ides the opinion, entertained by each &s;tate of its own libe|rality and un&s;atisfied demands again&s;t the United States, there is another con&s;ideration, not le&s;s worthy of attention. The fir&s;t rule for determining each quota was the value of all land granted or &s;urveyed, and of the buildings and im|provements thereon. It is no longer doubted, that an equi|table, uniform mode of e&s;timating that value, is impractica|ble; and therefore twelve &s;tates have &s;ub&s;tituted the number of inhabitants under certain limitations, as the &s;tandard ac|cording to which money is to be furni&s;hed. But under the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting articles of the union, the a&s;&s;ent of the thirteenth &s;tate is nece&s;&s;ary, and has not yet been given. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of it&s;elf le&s;&s;en the hope of procuring a revenue for foederal u&s;es; and the mi&s;carriage of the impo&s;t almo&s;t rivets our de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;appointments, it would afford &s;ome con|&s;olation, if when rebellion &s;hall threaten any &s;tate, an ulti|mate a&s;ylum could be found under the wing of Congre&s;s.
<PB N="6" REF="020669_0006_0FB0A8895B4E3FE8">
But it is at lea&s;t equivocal, whether they can intrude forces into a &s;tate, rent a&s;under by civil di&s;cord, even with the pure&s;t &s;olicitude for our foederal welfare, and on the mo&s;t urgen intreaties of the &s;tate it&s;elf. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men.</P>
<P>To the&s;e defects of Congre&s;&s;ional power, the hi&s;tory of man has &s;ubjoined others, not le&s;s alarming. I earne&s;tly pray, that the recollection of common &s;ufferings, which ter|minated in common glory, may check the &s;allies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friend&s;hip between the &s;tates. But I cannot pre&s;ume, that we are &s;uperior to tho&s;e un&s;ocial pa&s;|&s;ions, which under like circum&s;tances have infe&s;ted more ancient nations. I cannot pre&s;ume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts for commercial advantages, in the di&s;con|tents, which the neighborhood of territory has been &s;een to engender in other quarters of the globe, and in the efforts of faction and intrigue&mdash;thirteen di&s;tinct communities under no effective &s;uperintending controul (as the United States confe&s;&s;edly now are notwith&s;tanding the bold terms of the con|federation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this inquiry we &s;hall find the general pro&s;perity to decline under a &s;y&s;tem thus unnerved. No &s;ooner is the merchant prepared for foreign ports with the trea&s;ures, which this new world kindly offers to his ac|ceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are &s;hut again&s;t American &s;hipping, or opened under oppre&s;&s;ive re|gulations. He urges Congre&s;s to a counter-policy, and is an&s;wered only by a condolence on the general misfortune. He is immediately &s;truck with the conviction, that until ex|clu&s;ion &s;hall be oppo&s;ed to exclu&s;ion and re&s;triction to re|&s;triction, the American flag will be di&s;graced. For who can conceive, that thirteen legi&s;latures, viewing commerce under different relations, and fancying them&s;elves, di&s;charged from every obligation to concede the &s;malle&s;t of their com|mercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought into a concert of action in defiance of every preju|dice? Nor is this all:&mdash;Let the great improvements be re|counted, which have inriched and illu&s;trated Europe: Let it be noted, how few tho&s;e are, which will be ab&s;olutely de|nied to the United States, comprehending within their boun|daries the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of climate, &s;oil and navigable waters; then let the mo&s;t &s;anguine patriot bani&s;h, if he can, the mortifying belief, that all the&s;e mu&s;t &s;leep, until they &s;hall
<PB N="7" REF="020669_0007_0FB0A88B2B323E28">
be rou&s;ed by the vigour of a national government.</P>
<P>I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by minute details; becau&s;e they are evidently fortified by truth, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of United America. I &s;hall therefore no longer deplore the unfitne&s;s of the confederation to &s;ecure our peace; but proceed, with a truly unaffected di&s;tru&s;t of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the government of the United States ought to enjoy? how they ought to be defended again&s;t incroachment? whether they can be interwoven in the confederation without an alterati|on of its very e&s;&s;ence? or mu&s;t be lodged in new hands? &s;hewing at the &s;ame time the convul&s;ions, which &s;eem to await us from a di&s;&s;olution of the union or partial confe|deracies.</P>
<P>To mark the kind and degree of authority, which ought to be confided to the government of the United States is no more than to rever&s;e the de&s;cription, which I have already given, of the defects of the confederation.</P>
<P>From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of mo|ney, and that the&s;e will be &s;low indeed, if dependent on &s;upplication alone. For what better name do requi&s;itions de&s;erve, which may be evaded or oppo&s;ed, without the fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indi&s;pen&s;able in|gredient, it ought not to be directed again&s;t a &s;tate, as a &s;tate; it being impo&s;&s;ible to attempt it except by blockading the trade of the delinquent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if the&s;e violent &s;chemes were eligible, in other re&s;pects both of them might perhaps be defeated by the &s;cantine&s;s of the public che&s;t; would be tardy in their complete effect, as the expence of the land and naval equipments mu&s;t be fir&s;t reimbur&s;ed; and might drive the pro&s;cribed &s;tate into the de&s;perate re&s;olve of inviting foreign alliances. Again&s;t each of them lie &s;eparate unconquerable objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the &s;tates, they be|ing differently circum&s;tanced in commerce and in ports; nay an excommunication from the privileges of the union would be vain, becau&s;e every regulation or prohibition may be ea&s;ily eluded under the rights of American citizen|&s;hip, or of foreign nations. But how &s;hall we &s;peak of the intru&s;ion of troops? &s;hall we arm citizens again&s;t citi|tizens, and habituate them to &s;hed kindred blood? &s;hall we ri&s;que the inflicting of wounds, which will generate a rancour never to be &s;ubdued? would there be no room to fear, that an army accu&s;tomed to &s;ight, for the e&s;tabli&s;h+ment
<PB N="8" REF="020669_0008_0FB0A88C5B772C78">
of authority, would &s;alute an emperor of their own? Let us not bring the&s;e things into jeopardy. Let us rather &s;ub&s;titute the &s;ame proce&s;s, by which individuals are com|pelled to contribute to the government of their own &s;tates. In&s;tead of making requi&s;itions to the legi&s;latures, it would appear more proper, that taxes &s;hould he impo&s;ed by the foederal head, under due modifications and guards: that the collectors &s;hould demand from the citizens their re&s;pec|tive quotas, and be &s;upported as in the collection of ordi|nary taxes.</P>
<P>It follows too, that, as the general government will be re&s;pon&s;ible to foreign nations, it ought to he able to annul any offen&s;ive mea&s;ure, or inforce any public right. Per|haps among the topics on which they may be aggrieved or complain, the commercial intercour&s;e, and the manner, in which contracts are di&s;charged, may con&s;titute the princi|pal articles of clamour.</P>
<P>It follows too, that the general government ought to be the &s;upreme arbiter for adju&s;ting every contention among the &s;tates. In all their connections therefore with each other, and particularly in commerce, which will probably create the greate&s;t di&s;cord, it ought to hold the reins</P>
<P>It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each &s;tate again&s;t dome&s;tic as well as external vio|lence.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly it follows, that through the general govern|ment alone can we ever a&s;&s;ume the rank, to which we are entitled by our re&s;ources and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Should the people of America &s;urrender the&s;e powers, they can be paramount to the con&s;titutions, and ordinary acts of legi&s;lation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if the confederation had been &s;olemnly que&s;tioned in oppo&s;ition to our con&s;titution or even to one of our laws, po&s;terior to it, it mu&s;t have given way. For never did it obtain with us a higher ratification, than a re&s;olution of A&s;&s;embly in the daily form.</P>
<P>This will be one &s;ecurity again&s;t incroachment. But another not le&s;s effectual is, to exclude the individual &s;tates from any agency in the national government, as far as it may be &s;afe, and their interpo&s;ition may not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But now, fir, permit me to declare, that in my humble iudgment the powers by which alone the ble&s;&s;ings of a gene|ral government can be accompli&s;hed, cannot be interwoven
<PB N="9" REF="020669_0009_0FB0A891C07566B0">
in the confederation without a change of its very e&s;&s;ence; or in other words, that the confederation mu&s;t be thrown a&s;ide. This is almo&s;t demon&s;trable from the inefficacy of requi&s;iti|ons and from the nece&s;&s;ity of converting them into acts of au|thority. My &s;uffrage, as a citizen, is al&s;o for additional powers. But to whom &s;hall we commit the&s;e acts of authority, the&s;e additional powers? To Congre&s;s?&mdash;When I formerly la|mented the defects in the juri&s;diction of Congre&s;s, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the foederal head ought not to be &s;o circum&s;cribed. For free as I am at all times to profe&s;s my reverence for that body, and the individuals, who compo&s;e it, I am yet equally free to make known my aver&s;ion to repo&s;e &s;uch a tru&s;t in a tribunal &s;o con&s;tituted. My objections are not the vi&s;ions of theory, but the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation in America, and of the experience of others abroad. 1. The legi&s;lative and executive are concentred in the &s;ame per&s;ons. This, where real power exi&s;ts, mu&s;t eventuate in tyranny. 2. The re|pre&s;entation of the &s;tates bears no proportion to their impor|tance. This is an unrea&s;onable &s;ubjection of the will of the majority to that of the minority. 3. The mode of election and the liability to be recalled may too often render the de|legates rather partizans of their own &s;tates, than repre&s;enta|tives of the union. 4. Cabal and intrigue mu&s;t con&s;e|quently gain an a&s;cendancy in a cour&s;e of years. 5. A &s;ingle hou&s;e of legi&s;lation will &s;ome times be precipitate, perhaps pa&s;&s;ionate. 6. As long as &s;even &s;tates are required for the &s;malle&s;t, and nine for the greate&s;t votes, may not foreign influence at &s;ome future day in&s;inuate it&s;elf, &s;o as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is &s;carcely within the verge of po&s;&s;ibility, that &s;o numerous an a&s;&s;embly &s;hould acquire that &s;ecrecy, di&s;|patch, and vigour, which are the te&s;t of excellence in the executive department.</P>
<P>My inference from the&s;e facts and principles is, that the new powers mu&s;t be depo&s;ited in a new body, growing out of a con&s;olidation of the union, as far as the circum&s;tances of the &s;tates will allow. Perhaps, however, &s;ome may meditate its di&s;&s;olution, and others partial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is an idea awful indeed and irreconcileable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> without union we mu&s;t be undone. For before the voice of war was heard, the pul&s;e of the then colonies was tried and found to beat in uni&s;on. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> labour of our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every Congre&s;s to
<PB N="10" REF="020669_0010_0FB0A8932BE35A00">
bind us together. But in no example was this truth more clearly di&s;played, than in the prudence, with which inde|pendence was unfolded to the &s;ight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly called for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and in the hour of heavy di&s;tre&s;s, the remem|brance of our &s;ocial &s;trength not only forbade de&s;pair, but drew from Congre&s;s the mo&s;t illu&s;trious repetition of their &s;ettled purpo&s;e to de&s;pi&s;e all terms, &s;hort of independence.</P>
<P>Behold then, how &s;ucce&s;sful and glorious we have been, while we acted in fraternal concord. But let us di&s;card the illu&s;ion, that by this &s;ucce&s;s and this glory the cre&s;t of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our governments are yet too youthful to have acquired &s;tability from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among the upright and intelligent, few can read without emotion the future fate of the &s;tates, if &s;evered from each other. Then &s;hall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue&mdash;Then &s;hall we hear of partitions of our country. If a prince, inflamed by the lu&s;t of conque&s;t, &s;hould u&s;e one &s;tate, as the in&s;trument of en&s;laving others&mdash; if every &s;tate is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to maintain large military e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;if all que&s;tions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by negotiation&mdash; in a word, if all the direful misfortunes, which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land&mdash;for what have we contended? Why have we exhau&s;ted our wealth? Why have we ba&s;ely betrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cau&s;e?</P>
<P>But dreadful as the total di&s;&s;olution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no le&s;s horror at the thought of par|tial confederacies. I have not the lea&s;t ground for &s;up|po&s;ing, that an overture of this kind would be li&s;tened to by a &s;ingle &s;tate; and the pre&s;umption is, that the politics of the greater part of the &s;tates flow from the warme&s;t attach|ment to an union of the whole. If however a le&s;&s;er confe|deracy could be obtained, by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen well to weigh the probable con&s;equences, before they attempt to form it.</P>
<P>On &s;uch an event, the &s;trength of the union would be divided into two or perhaps three parts. Has it &s;o increa&s;ed &s;ince the war as to be divi&s;ible?&mdash;and yet remain &s;ufficient for our happine&s;s?</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t limit of any partial confederacy, which Vir|ginia
<PB N="11" REF="020669_0011_0FB0A89560A70628" MS="y">
could expect to form, would comprehend only the three &s;outhern &s;tates, and her neare&s;t northern neighbour. But they, like our&s;elves, are dimini&s;hed in their real force, by the mixture of an unhappy &s;pecies of population.</P>
<P>Again may I a&s;k, whether the opulence of the United States has been augmented &s;ince the war? This is an|&s;wered in the negative by a load of debt, and the declen&s;ion of trade.</P>
<P>At all times mu&s;t a &s;outhern confederacy &s;upport &s;hips of war, and &s;oldiery. As &s;oon would a navy move from the fore&s;t, and an army &s;pring from the earth, as &s;uch a confederacy, indebted, impoveri&s;hed in its com|merce, and de&s;titute of men, could, for &s;ome years at lea&s;t provide an ample defence for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let it not be forgotten, that nations, which can inforce their rights, have large claims again&s;t the United States, and that the creditor may in&s;i&s;t on payment from any one of them. Which of them would probably be the victim? The mo&s;t productive and the mo&s;t expo&s;ed. When vexed by repri&s;als or war, the &s;outhern &s;tates will &s;ue for alliances on this continent or beyond &s;ea. If for the for|mer, the nece&s;&s;ity of an union of the whole is decided. If for the latter, America will, I fear, re-act the &s;cenes of confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed, exhibited among mo&s;t of tho&s;e nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on auxiliaries.</P>
<P>Two or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The ancient friend&s;hip between the citizens of America, being thus cut off, bitterne&s;s and ho&s;tility will &s;ucceed in its place. In order to prepare again&s;t &s;urround|ing danger, we &s;hall be compelled to ve&s;t &s;omewhere or other power approaching near to a military government.</P>
<P>The annals of the world have abounded &s;o much with in&s;tances of a divided people, being a prey to foreign influ|ence, that I &s;hall not re&s;train my apprehen&s;ions of it, &s;hould our union be torn a&s;under. The opportunity of in&s;inuat|ing it will be multiplied in proportion to the parts, into which we may be broken.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;ir, I am fatigued with &s;ummoning up to my imagination the mi&s;eries, which will harra&s;s the United States, if torn from each other, and which will not end, until they are &s;uper&s;eded by fre&s;h mi&s;chiefs under the yoke of a ty|rant.</P>
<P>I come therefore to the la&s;t and perhaps only refuge in our difficulties, a con&s;olidation of the union, as far as cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="12" REF="020669_0012_0FB0A89AA84D71A0" MS="y">
will permit. To fulfil this de&s;irable object, the con&s;titution was framed by the Foederal Convention. A quorum of eleven &s;tates, and the only member from a twelfth have &s;ub&s;cribed it; Mr. MASON of Virginia, Mr. GERRY of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and my&s;elf having refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Why I refu&s;ed, would, I hope, be &s;olved to the &s;atis|faction of tho&s;e, who know me, by &s;aying that a &s;en&s;e of duty commanded me thus to act. It commanded me, &s;ir, For believe me, that no event of my life ever occupied more of my reflection. To &s;ub&s;cribe &s;eemed to offer no incon&s;iderable gratification; &s;ince it would have pre&s;ented me to the world, as a fellow-labourer with the learned and zealous &s;tate&s;men of America. But it was far more inter|e&s;ting to my feelings, that I was about to differ from three of my colleagues; one of whom is, to the honor of the country, which he has &s;aved, imbo&s;omed in their affections, and can receive no prai&s;e from the highe&s;t lu&s;tre of language; the other two of whom have been long inrolled among the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t lovers of the commonwealth; and the un|&s;haken and intimate friend&s;hip of all of whom I have ever prized, and &s;till do prize, as among the happie&s;t of all my acqui&s;itions. I was no &s;tranger to the reigning partiality for the members, who compo&s;ed the convention; and had not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, that from this cau&s;e, and from the ardor for a reform of government, the fir&s;t applau&s;es at lea&s;t would be loud, and profu&s;e. I &s;u&s;pected too, that there was &s;omething in the human brea&s;t, which for a time would be apt to con&s;true a temperatene&s;s in politicks into an enmity to the union. Nay I plainly fore&s;aw, that in the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of parties, a middle line would probably be interpreted into a want of enterprize and deci&s;ion. But the&s;e con&s;iderations, how &s;educing &s;oever, were feeble opponents to the &s;ugge&s;tions of my con&s;cience. I was &s;ent to exerci&s;e my judgment, and to exerci&s;e it was my fixed determination; being in&s;tructed by even an imperfect acquaintance with mankind, that &s;elf approbation is the only true reward, which a political career can be&s;tow, and that popularity would have been but another name for per|fidy, if to &s;ecure it, I had given up the freedom of think|ing for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would have been a peculiar plea&s;ure to me, to have a&s;certained, before I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow citizens, con&s;idered relatively to a government, &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially differing from the confederation, as that,
<PB N="13" REF="020669_0013_0FB0A89CAE67D260" MS="y">
which is now &s;ubmitted. But this was for many obvious rea&s;ons impo&s;&s;ible: and I was thereby deprived of what I thought the nece&s;&s;ary guides.</P>
<P>I &s;aw however that the confederation was tottering from its own weakne&s;s, and that the fitting of the convention was a &s;ignal of its total in&s;ufficiency. I was therefore rea|dy to a&s;&s;ent to a &s;cheme of government, which was propo&s;|ed, and which went beyond the limits of the confederation, believing, that without being too exten&s;ive it would have pre&s;erved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius &s;hould be collected.</P>
<P>But when the plan which is now before the General A&s;&s;embly, was on its pa&s;&s;age through the convention, I moved, that the &s;tate-conventions &s;hould be at liberty to amend, and that a &s;econd general Convention &s;hould be holden to di&s;cu&s;s the amendments, which &s;hould be &s;ug|ge&s;ted by them. This motion was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tifi|ed by the manner, in which the confederation was for|warded originally, by Congre&s;s to the &s;tate-legi&s;latures, in many of which amendments were propo&s;ed, and tho&s;e amendments were afterwards examined in Congre&s;s. Such a motion was doubly expedient here, as the delegation of &s;o much more power was &s;ought for. But it was nega|tived. I then expre&s;&s;ed my unwillingne&s;s to &s;ign. My rea&s;ons were the following.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;aid in the re&s;olutions, which accompany the con&s;titution, that it is to be &s;ubmitted to a convention of Delegates, cho&s;en in each &s;tate by the people there of, for their a&s;&s;ent and ratification. The meaning of the&s;e terms is allowed univer&s;ally to be, that the Convention mu&s;t either adopt the con&s;titution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is po&s;itively forbidden to amend. If therefore I had &s;igned, I &s;hould have felt my&s;elf bound to be &s;ilent as to amendments, and to endeavor to &s;upport the con&s;titution without the correction of a letter. With this con&s;equence before my eyes and with a determination to attempt an amendment, I was taught by a regard for con&s;i&s;tency not to &s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">2. My opinion always was, and &s;till is, that every ci|tizen of America, let the cri&s;is be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to propo&s;e through his repre&s;entatives any amendment, which in his apprehen&s;ion tends to the public welfare&mdash;By &s;igning I &s;hould have contradicted this &s;entiment.</P>
<P N="3">3. A con&s;titution ought to have the hearts of the people
<PB N="14" REF="020669_0014_0FB0A89E602A7B58" MS="y">
on its &s;ide. But if at a future day it &s;hould be burthen|&s;ome, after having been adopted in the whole, and they &s;hould in&s;inuate, that it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure forced upon them, by being confined to the &s;ingle alternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impre&s;&s;ions and with my opinions I &s;hould not be able to ju&s;tify my&s;elf had I &s;igned.</P>
<P N="4">4. I was always &s;atisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great &s;ubject, would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the critici&s;m of the world, and that no man can a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, how a con&s;titution will work for a cour&s;e of years, until at lea&s;t he &s;hall have heard the ob&s;ervations of the people at large. I al&s;o fear more from inaccuracies in a con&s;titution, than from gro&s;s errors in any other compo&s;i|tion; becau&s;e our deare&s;t intere&s;ts are to be regulated by it, and power, if loo&s;ely given, e&s;pecially where it will be in|terpreted with great latitude, may bring &s;orrow in its executi|on. Had I &s;igned with the&s;e ideas, I &s;hould have virtually &s;hut my ears again&s;t the information, which I ardently de&s;ired.</P>
<P N="5">5. I was afraid, that if the Con&s;titution was to be &s;ub|mitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly reject|ed by them, they would not only reject it, but bid a la&s;ting farewell to the union. This formidable event I wi&s;hed to avert, by keeping my&s;elf free to propo&s;e amendments, and thus, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove the ob&s;tacles to an effectual government. But it will be a&s;ked, whether all the&s;e argu|ments were not well weighed in Convention. They were, &s;ir, and with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the re&s;pectability of tho&s;e, with whom I was a&s;&s;ociated, I almo&s;t lo&s;t confidence in the&s;e principles. On other occa|&s;ions I &s;hould chearfully have yielded to a majority; on this the fate of thou&s;ands, yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield, until I was convinced&mdash;</P>
<P>Again may I be a&s;ked, why the mode pointed out in the Con&s;titution for its amendment, may not be a &s;uffi|cient &s;ecurity again&s;t its imperfections, without now arre&s;ting it in its progre&s;s?&mdash;My an&s;wers are, 1. that it is better to amend, while we have the Con&s;titution in our power, while the pa&s;&s;ions of de&s;igning men are not yet enli&s;t|ed and while a bare majority of the &s;tates may amend, than to wait for the uncertain a&s;&s;ent of three fourths of the &s;tates. 2. That a bad feature in government becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent chang|es of a Con&s;titution even if practicable ought not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> be wi&s;hed, but avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible: and 4. That in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it may by que&s;tionable, whether, after the
<PB N="15" REF="020669_0015_0FB0A8A0189CACA8" MS="y">
particular advantages of its operation &s;hall be di&s;cerned, three fourths of the &s;tates can be induced to amend.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k, to devi&s;e a &s;cheme which &s;hall be &s;uitable to the views of all. Many expedients have occurred to me, but none of them appear le&s;s exceptionable than this: that if our Convention &s;hould choo&s;e to amend, another federal Convention be recommended: that in that federal Convention the amendments propo&s;ed by this or any other &s;tate, be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and if incorporated in the con&s;titution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other &s;tates &s;hould be unwilling to accede to a &s;econd Convention, the con&s;titution be again laid before the &s;ame &s;tate-con|ventions, which &s;hall again a&s;&s;emble on the &s;ummons of the Executives, and it &s;hall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count &s;uch a delay, as nothing in compari&s;on with &s;o grand an object; e&s;pecially too as the privilege of amending mu&s;t terminate after the u&s;e of it once.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it not incumbent on me from having contended for amendments, to &s;et forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with reluctance; becau&s;e it is remote from my intentions to catch the prejudices or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of any man. But as I mean only to manife&s;t, that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every objection at full length would be an immen&s;e labour, I &s;hall content my|&s;elf with enumerating certain heads, in which the con&s;ti|tution is mo&s;t repugnant to my wi&s;hes</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t points are the equality of &s;uffrage in the Senate, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of commerce to a mere majority in the legi&s;lature, with no other check than the revi&s;ion of the Pre&s;ident. I conjecture that neither of the&s;e things can be corrected; and particularly the former; without which we mu&s;t have ri&s;en perhaps in di&s;order.</P>
<P>But I am &s;anguine in hoping, that in every other, ju&s;tly obnoxious clau&s;e, Virginia, will be &s;econded by a majority of the &s;tates. I hope, that &s;he will be &s;econded 1. in cau&s;ing all ambiguities of expre&s;&s;ion to be preci&s;ely ex|plained: 2. in rendering the Pre&s;ident ineligible after a given number of years: 3. in taking from him either the power of nominating to the judiciary offices, or of filling up va|cancies which therein may happen during the rece&s;s of the &s;enate, by granting commi&s;&s;ions which &s;hall expire at the end of their next &s;e&s;&s;ion: 4. in taking from him the power of pardoning
<PB N="16" REF="020669_0016_0FB0A8A4C0232BE8" MS="y">
for trea&s;on, at lea&s;t before conviction: 5. in drawing a line be|tween the powers of Congre&s;s and individual &s;tates; and in defining the former; &s;o as to leave no cla&s;hing of juri&s;|dictions not dangerous di&s;putes: and to prevent the one from being &s;wallowed up by the other, under the cover of general words, and implication: 6. in abridging the power of the Senate to make treaties the &s;upreme laws of the land: 7. in providing a tribunal in&s;tead of the Senate for the im|peachment of Senators: 8. in incapacitating the Congre&s;s to determine their own &s;alaries: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in limiting and de|fining the judicial power.</P>
<P>The proper remedy mu&s;t be con&s;igned to the wi&s;dom of the convention: and the final &s;tep, which Virginia &s;hall pur&s;ue, if her overtures &s;hall be di&s;carded, mu&s;t al&s;o re&s;t with them.</P>
<P>But as I affect neither my&s;tery nor &s;ubtilty, in politics, I he&s;itate not to &s;ay, that the mo&s;t fervent prayer of my foul is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a firm, energetic government; that the mo&s;t inveterate cur&s;e, which can befal us, is a di&s;|&s;olution of the union; and that the pre&s;ent moment, if &s;uffered to pa&s;s away unemployed, can never be recalled. The&s;e were my opinions, while I acted as a Delegate; they &s;way me, while I &s;peak as a private citizen. I &s;hall there|fore cling to the union, as the rock of our &s;alvation, and urge Virginia to fini&s;h the &s;alutary work, which &s;he has begun. And if after our be&s;t efforts for amendments they cannot be obtained, I &s;cruple not to declare, (notwith&s;tand|ing the advantage, which &s;uch a declaration may give to the enemies of my propo&s;al,) that I will, as an individual ci|tizen, accept the con&s;titution; becau&s;e I would regulate my&s;elf by the &s;pirit of America.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me, &s;ir, for having been thus tedious. My feelings and duty demanded this expo&s;ition: for through no other channel could I re&s;cue my omi&s;&s;ion to &s;ign from mi&s;repre&s;entation, and in no more effectual way could I exhibit to the General A&s;&s;embly an unre&s;erved hi&s;tory of my conduct.</P>
<P>I have the honor, Sir, to be, with great re&s;pect, your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant,</P>
