</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOLY Job, tho' he is &s;aid to be per|fect and upright, one that feared God, and avoided that which is evil; tho' he was a pattern of patience, and manife&s;ted great re&s;ignation to the divine will, under the mo&s;t grievous and uncom|mon trials; yet the hand of God did &s;ome|times &s;o &s;orely pre&s;s him, and he was &s;o &s;corched with the vehement heat of the furnace of affliction into which he was ca&s;t, that like Mo&s;es, he &s;poke unadvi&s;edly with his lips. He murmurs at the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence towards him, and is ready to charge God with &s;everity in his
<PB N="6" REF="012415_0004_0F8973D83133B7E8">dealings with him. For this, his friends had &s;harply reproved him, and Elihu in an e&s;pecial manner had &s;poken very clo&s;ely and pertinently to him, in order to convince him of the ju&s;tice and equity of the divine conduct, and to &s;ilence his murmurings, and bring him to acquie&s;ce in God's providential dealings with him: But all to little purpo&s;e; &s;till Job is unea&s;y and un&s;atisfied; till at la&s;t God him&s;elf &s;peaks to him out of the whirlwind, and clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed him with many &s;erious and weighty que&s;tions in this, and the follow|ing chapter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion that God put to him, to humble him and &s;hew him his ignorance, was concerning the creation of the world, and who it was that gave it its regular form and &s;tructure, v. 4&mdash;7 "Where wa&s;t thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou ha&s;t under&s;tanding. Who hath laid the mea&s;ures thereof, if thou knowe&s;t? or who hath &s;tretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fa&s;tned? or who laid the corner &s;tone thereof?" At the laying of which corner-&s;tone, "the morning &s;tars &s;ang to|gether, and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy." It is the eternal Jehovah that is here po&s;ing a mortal worm with the&s;e que&s;tions;
<PB N="7" REF="012415_0005_0F8973D8F2A6CC00">and (as we might ju&s;tly expect) the lan|guage is &s;ublime, the expre&s;&s;ions lofty, and the &s;entiments well adapted to &s;trike con|viction into a repining &s;ufferer, murmuring at the all-wi&s;e conduct of his Maker: q. d. <Q>O Job, you pretend to have a mighty in|&s;ight into the coun&s;els of God; you have made a great figure among the children of the Ea&s;t; thou &s;ette&s;t up for an oracle and do&s;t pretend to cen&s;ure the ju&s;tice and equity of the divine proceedings&mdash; now only tell me where thou wa&s;t when the foundations of the earth were laid, declare how it came to be &s;o finely fram|ed, &s;o firmly fixed, &s;o exactly proporti|oned, and &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated: If you are &s;o wi&s;e and under&s;tanding in the government of the world as you pre|tend to be, you doubtle&s;s know &s;ome|thing about the formation of this noble fabric: and I demand of you to tell me where you was, when at the fir&s;t appea|rance of this glorious &s;tructure, the "morning &s;tars" &s;truck their harmonious notes, and with perfect concord chanted the mo&s;t melodious &s;ongs, in prai&s;e to its great Creator. Was you then pre&s;ent, to hear the &s;houts of joy among the <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> and in what a rapturous manner they applauded the work, and adored the
<PB N="8" REF="012415_0006_0F8973D9B24CFBD0">Workman? Was your ear charmed with the heavenly mu&s;ick? and did you join your feeble voice, with the &s;houting miriads that extolled my name upon that occa&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P>Thus does God query with Job. on purpo&s;e to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his folly, in finding fault with His providence in governing the world, &s;eeing he was not pre&s;ent at the formation of it. <Q>And &s;ince God did not con&s;ult with him in making the world, and yet it is well made; he need not expect that God &s;hould con&s;ult with him about the government of the world, and yet it &s;hall be well governed:</Q> And therefore it became him and all others, chearfully to acquie&s;ce in the wi&s;dom of divine providence, and not to murmur at any of its proceedings.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the connexion of the text with the context, and what was the de&s;ign of God therein&mdash;You &s;ee, the <HI>morning &s;tars,</HI> (by which we are undoubtedly to under|&s;tand the angels) are bro't in &s;inging prai&s;e to God at the laying of the foundations of the earth; which &s;uppo&s;es that they had an exi&s;tence, before the earth was regularly formed and fa&s;hioned, or otherwi&s;e they could not &s;ing together upon that occa&s;ion. Mo&s;es has told us
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. i. x.</NOTE> that "In the beginning
<PB N="9" REF="012415_0007_0F8973DA7331CDF0">God created the heaven and the earth,"&mdash; the angels doubtle&s;s are included in the creation of the <HI>former;</HI> and being formed to &s;ing their Maker's prai&s;e, they <HI>early</HI> began that ble&s;&s;ed work, for which they are here called <HI>morning</HI> &s;tars: and carefully ob&s;erving the hand of God forming and fa&s;hioning this terraqueous globe, and mak|ing it a &s;uitable habitation for man, and knowing, perhaps, that their and our Creator would "rejoice in the habitable parts of the earth, and his delight would be with the &s;ons of men;" as they &s;aw mat|ter, &s;o they wanted not a di&s;po&s;ition for prai&s;ing God, and giving to him the glory due to his great name therefor.</P>
<P>The latter part of the ver&s;e, in which it is &s;aid, <HI>all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e to be only exegetical of the former: And what is de&s;igned by the whole ver&s;e is, to &s;hew, that the angelic tribes were &s;o &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of the infinite maje&s;ty and power of God in rearing the &s;tately &s;tructure of the world, that they all with one accord expre&s;&s;ed their joy, and glorifi|ed God by offering to Him their melodious &s;ongs of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>To &s;ing prai&s;es to God, is the delightful employment of Heaven; and not only an|gels,
<PB N="10" REF="012415_0008_0F8973DB325C8460">but <HI>men</HI> are capable of bearing a part in it: And therefore it becomes <HI>them,</HI> in imitation of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits above, to learn to tune their voices in a manner &s;uit|able to offer prai&s;es to their maker&mdash;and while they are in this world, to begin that ble&s;&s;ed work, which we hope to be forever employed in, when we come to Heaven.</P>
<P>Under the direction of this text, I &s;hall attempt the following things&mdash;viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;hew that &s;inging prai&s;es to God, is a duty which He requires of all his ratio|nal creatures, of men as well as of angels.</P>
<P N="2">II. Say &s;omething as to the manner of performing this duty:&mdash;and then conclude with addre&s;&s;es &s;uited to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew that &s;inging prai&s;es to God, is a duty which He requires of all his rational creatures, of <HI>men</HI> as well as of angels.&mdash;Every rational creature that has under&s;tanding enough to con&s;ider and con|template the works of God, and ob&s;erve His perfections and attributes di&s;played in all the divine operations, are under moral obligations to prai&s;e and glorify Him there|for. Indeed the very de&s;ign of God in
<PB N="11" REF="012415_0009_0F8973DBF20D04D0">forming rea&s;onable creatures, and di&s;cover|ing his perfections to them, was not only that He might communicate happine&s;s to them, but al&s;o that they might glorify Him; i. e. adore and prai&s;e Him for his perfec|tions: For <HI>who&s;o offereth prai&s;e, glorifieth me,</HI> &s;aith God, P&s;. 50.23. There is &s;ome|thing of the divine attributes di&s;covered in all the works of God, whether of creation, providence, or grace: And according as God di&s;covers him&s;elf to his creatures, &s;o &s;hould their acknowledgments of Him, be. And not to acknowledge God according to the di&s;coveries he makes of his perfections unto us, is a degree of athei&s;m it&s;elf: It is in a &s;en&s;e to deny that He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e perfections, or worthy to be prai&s;ed for them. Every <HI>being</HI> ought to be acknow|ledged by others, according to the di&s;|coveries that are made of <HI>It</HI> to others; otherwi&s;e <HI>It</HI> is denied by them: This is rea|&s;onable and &s;it in the very nature of things. And &s;ince the &s;upreme Being in his works has di&s;covered, unlimited power, un&s;earch|able wi&s;dom, boundle&s;s goodne&s;s, &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s, and inflexible ju&s;tice, every rea|&s;onable creature is in duty bound to prai&s;e Him for the&s;e his perfections, according to the di&s;coveries he has, or might have had of them.</P>

The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxlv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> <HI>All thy works &s;hall prai&s;e thee, O Lord,</HI> i. e. they <HI>all</HI> even the in|animate parts of the creation furni&s;h rational intelligences with matter for prai&s;ing Him. In this &s;en&s;e "the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament &s;heweth forth his handy work." And the "&s;un and moon, and all the &s;tars of light," prai&s;e Him: They do it, by exciting angels and men to that ble&s;&s;ed work; and furni&s;hing them with abundant matter for it. And when inanimate things, &s;uch as the &s;un and moon and &s;tars, are &s;aid to prai&s;e God; it intimates that there is much excellency in the works of God, that if they could &s;peak, they would declare and &s;hew forth his prai&s;e; even as when the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t rejoiced and prai&s;ed God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had &s;een, &s;aying,

So here, if angels and men will not &s;ing prai&s;e to God, for the works of creation, providence and grace; rather than God &s;hould not have the glory thereof, the &s;un and moon and
<PB N="13" REF="012415_0011_0F8973DE3A386F28">&s;tars, would all break out into joyful &s;ongs of prai&s;es to him.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, at the creation of the world, the ble&s;&s;ed angels were "hymning the eternal Father," adoring his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, which were therein di&s;play'd: &s;o at the fir&s;t appearance of the <HI>new creation,</HI> when Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the corner-&s;tone thereof was laid, then did the&s;e "morning &s;tars" again &s;ing together, "and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy." No &s;ooner was it known in heaven, that the eternally be|gotten of the Father, appeared in a mortal form, but an angel is ordered with &s;wifte&s;t wing to convey the news thereof to the humble &s;hepherds, who were with earne&s;t expectation "waiting for the con&s;olation of I&s;rael." The&s;e glad tidings of &s;alvation were u&s;her'd in, by an anthem of prai&s;e from the heavenly ho&s;t; for <HI>&s;uddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, prai&s;ing God and &s;aying, Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that as at the birth of the old, &s;o al&s;o of the new creation, the ble&s;&s;ed angels tuned their harps to prai&s;e their Creator. And it is well worthy to be remarked here, that altho' neither the fir&s;t creation of our world, nor the redemption
<PB N="14" REF="012415_0012_0F8973DF5046D308">of it by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was de&s;igned parti|cularly for the benefit of the angels, but for men only, yet the&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted and benevolent &s;pirits rejoiced in it, and prai&s;ed God for it. This is worthy of our imita|tion: and let us learn from them, to ble&s;s and prai&s;e God for his goodne&s;s to others, as well as to our&s;elves. The exerci&s;e of &s;uch benevolence and good-will in us, will be doing God's will on earth, as it is done heaven: and as in &s;uch a temper we ap|proach near the inhabitants of the heavenly world; &s;o we &s;hall be &s;harers with them in their happine&s;s, and partakers with them in their joys.</P>
<P>Singing prai&s;es to God, was not de&s;igned to be the employment of angels only, but is a duty al&s;o incumbent upon <HI>man.</HI> God has given him a voice, and the faculty of &s;peech, which he is bound to employ in prai&s;ing and glorifying his Maker: Hence it is, that God has made <HI>&s;inging</HI> a part of his wor&s;hip; and he expects and requires of every one, that they wor&s;hip him in that way, according to their ability and the capacity God has given them. We mu&s;t "enter into his gates with thank&s;giving, and into his courts with prai&s;e." And we are commanded to <HI>&s;ing</HI> unto the Lord with the <HI>voice</HI> of a <HI>P&s;alm</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xcviii. 5.</NOTE>; and often, to prai&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="012415_0013_0F8973DFB252DFA0">him with our <HI>voices,</HI> and to <HI>&s;ing</HI> prai&s;es unto Him. Altho' &s;inging be a token of joy, it is neverthele&s;s a duty incumbent on us at all times; for we are commanded to "rejoice evermore," and to "rejoice in the Lord at all times"; nor can our cir|cum&s;tances be &s;o afflictive, but that we have occa&s;ion of &s;inging prai&s;e to God: For how di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;oever our e&s;tate may be, yet there are many favors and mercies &s;hewn to us which demand our prai&s;es. And the pious P&s;almi&s;t re&s;olves,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ci. 1.</NOTE> I will &s;ing of mer|cy and of judgment, unto thee O Lord will I &s;ing.</P>
<P>Singing prai&s;es to God was a very &s;ublime and &s;olemn part of publick wor&s;hip, under the Old-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation: And our Savior has recommended it to all <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> by his own <HI>example,</HI> who, we find "&s;ung an hymn," after he had in&s;tituted the &s;acra|ment of the Lord's &s;upper. And God has been plea&s;ed to te&s;tify his acceptance and approbation of this part of his wor&s;hip un|der the New-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation, by miraculous operations in favor of tho&s;e that were e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">naged in this duty. When Paul and Silas were ca&s;t into pri&s;on&mdash;"at mid|night they prayed and &s;ang prai&s;es unto God;" and he te&s;tified his acceptance of their wor&s;hip, by cau&s;ing a great earthquake
<PB N="16" REF="012415_0014_0F8973E0727BB0D8">which &s;hook the foundations of the pri&s;on, opened the doors, and loo&s;ed the bands of the pri&s;oners
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.</NOTE>. And this very in&s;tance, one would think &s;hould be enough to &s;ilence all objectors, and convince every one that &s;inging is an acceptable duty to God; otherwi&s;e He would never have given &s;uch an evidence of his being well-plea&s;ed with it. Moreover, the apo&s;tles of our Lord frequently enjoin it upon chri&s;tians as an incumbent duty, to "teach and admoni&s;h one another, in <HI>p&s;alms, hymns</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging</HI> with grace in their hearts to the Lord."</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee that this duty is in it&s;elf rea&s;onable and fit: It is highly proper that God &s;hould be prai&s;ed by all his rea&s;onable creatures; and when they have a voice and capacity for it, they are under moral obligations to perform it. And we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, but that the neglect of it in &s;uch as might perform it gracefully and acceptably (if they took due pains) is a criminal omi&s;&s;i|on. It is a duty recommended to us by the greate&s;t examples, and enjoined by the greate&s;t Authority. We have the example of the holy angels, who were early engaged in this heavenly work&mdash;we have the exam|ple of the Old-Te&s;tament Church&mdash;of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles&mdash;as well as many expre&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="012415_0015_0F897528F23D7B10">precepts to enforce it upon us. Nay, There is &s;carce a book in all the &s;criptures, but what recommends <HI>this</HI> as a duty incumbent on us: And good men in all ages of the Church, have taken pains to promote it.</P>
<P>It may be added, <Q>from the experience of many good Authors, that where p&s;al|mody is mo&s;t u&s;ed, tho&s;e churches are generally the mo&s;t filled:&mdash;It has a great influence upon the minds of mo&s;t people, e&s;pecially <HI>youth,</HI> and keeps them from many vices on the Lord's-day, and at other times, which were it not for the charms of mu&s;ick, they would readily run into.</Q> God is daily communicating his mercy, benefits, and grace unto <HI>us;</HI> and we are bound to bring unto <HI>Him</HI> our tribute of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving: And <Q>to &s;ing prai&s;es, is by Him accepted, as the highe&s;t part of divine wor&s;hip, and in it we approach the neare&s;t to the wor&s;hip of the heavenly ho&s;ts.</Q> Prayer, indeed, is a great duty, and fitted to a &s;tate of trial and probation: But when that &s;tate is over, prayer will cea&s;e; but &s;inging of God's prai&s;es <HI>never</HI> will. It will be the main Employment of <HI>men,</HI> as well as of <HI>angels,</HI> as &s;oon as we get to heaven. Therefore, as the Apo&s;tle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xlii.</NOTE> prefers <HI>Charity,</HI> before all other chri&s;tain graces, becau&s;e it <HI>never
<PB N="18" REF="012415_0016_0F897529B1819D50">faileth;</HI> &s;o may <HI>we</HI> prefer <HI>&s;inging</HI> before all other chri&s;tian duties, becau&s;e it will never be laid a&s;ide&mdash;a whole <HI>eternity</HI> will be em|ployed in &s;inging anthems of prai&s;e to God and to the Lamb.</P>
<P>Thus much with regard to the <HI>Duty</HI> of &s;inging. I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;ay &s;omething of the <HI>manner,</HI> in which it ought to be performed&mdash;And here the example of the <HI>Angels</HI> is for our imitation&mdash;the morning &s;tars <HI>&s;ang together.</HI></P>
<P>This implies,</P>
<P N="1">1. Their <HI>union and agreement</HI> among them|&s;elves, to offer up their prai&s;es to God. They did not &s;ing as &s;cattered individuals, here one, and there another; but combined together, and &s;ang in concert. It adds much to the beauty of mu&s;ick, and makes it mo&s;t melodious, to have the united voices of a multitude, harmonizing together in the &s;ong. God has made men, as well as angels, &s;ociable creatures, and he expects and requires that they unite together in of|fering up their prai&s;es to Him: And as it is good for them to <HI>dwell,</HI> &s;o to <HI>&s;ing together in unity.</HI> And we &s;hould all be united in
<PB N="19" REF="012415_0017_0F89752A71DE8A60">our <HI>hearts,</HI> in this part of his wor&s;hip; and as many of us as <HI>can,</HI> &s;hould unite our <HI>voices,</HI> that with one heart and with one voice, we may glorify God.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is not <HI>every one,</HI> let him take never &s;o much pains with him&s;elf, that can modulate his voice &s;o as to be able to &s;ing in concert with others. Every one has his proper <HI>gift</HI> of God: And <HI>&s;ome</HI> have a talent this way, <HI>others</HI> have not. But it is to be feared that <HI>many</HI> that have a talent for &s;ing|ing, improve it not; but let it lie by <HI>wholly</HI> neglected. Such, will have but a poor ac|count to give of them&s;elves when an en|quiry is made, how they have improved the talents committed to them, for their Lord's glory. But where there is the want of a talent, there &s;hould be no want of a di&s;po&s;ition and good-will that God &s;hould be wor&s;hipped in this manner.

God, is <HI>a God of order, and not of confu&s;i|on:</HI> and He requires rule and order among all his wor&s;hippers, and in every part of his wor&s;hip.

<PB N="27" REF="012415_0025_0F897531331D9A10">all <HI>&s;uch</HI> tran&s;lations: and in tho&s;e countries where his influence mo&s;t extended, very few &s;uch p&s;alm-books could be procur|ed: And as <HI>ignorance</HI> with them <HI>was the mother of devotion,</HI> very few were taught to read, and &s;o unable to make u&s;e of p&s;alm-books if they had them.

But further&mdash;con&s;idering the di&s;advantages that attend &s;inging with reading, it may ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned, whether for the &s;ake of a <HI>very few</HI> old people and per&s;ons that can|not read, <HI>congregations</HI> are in duty bound to tolerate that practice: We know of no &s;uch provi&s;ion that was made for their in|firmities, either in God's ancient Church, or by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, or by any of the primitive Churches: And if <HI>they</HI> did it not, it will be hard to prove that <HI>we</HI> are in duty bound to do it. I would conde&s;cend as far for the &s;ake of &s;uch, as is any way rea&s;onable or convenient, but to do it at the
<PB N="31" REF="012415_0029_0F897534F1603A70">expence of the regular performance of that part of wor&s;hip, and to the di&s;advantage of &s;o many others, is what I cannot &s;ee &s;ufficient rea&s;on for. Be&s;ides, when once tho&s;e per&s;ons become better acquainted with the method, they will by the help of hearing the P&s;alm once read over by the <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> and attending to the <HI>&s;ingers</HI> as it is &s;ung, (if they &s;peak the words as di&s;tinctly and plainly as they can, which they &s;hould be careful to do) I &s;ay &s;uch per&s;ons, and indeed all the congregation may under|&s;tand the mo&s;t that is &s;ung. So that <HI>read|ing</HI> with &s;inging will be but of very little, if any advantage upon this account.</P>
<P>As to the plea that it has been the <HI>uni|ver&s;al practice</HI> of our <HI>Fore-fathers</HI> in this land, and that to &s;ing without reading, is a <HI>new|found invention of men;</HI> this is wholly a mi&s;|take.&mdash;Mr. MATHER, in his <HI>Ratio Di&s;cipline,</HI> a book publi&s;hed above fifty years ago, tells us "that &s;ome congregations where they had p&s;alm-books, &s;ung <HI>without reading:</HI>" and it is well known by tho&s;e that have made due enquiry, that it was never practi&s;ed in &s;ome of the <HI>olde&s;t</HI> Churches in this land; and and it is &s;o far from being a <HI>new</HI> invention, that it is as <HI>old</HI> as Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, and was the method practi&s;ed by our Savior and his Apo&s;tles: So that when we plead for it,
<PB N="32" REF="012415_0030_0F897535B10BAA00">we a&s;k for no more, than what was the <HI>good old way</HI>&mdash;and it is to be hoped that all that are lovers of that way, will readily join with us.</P>
<P>As for its making <HI>di&s;turbances</HI> in the Church&mdash;It is generally ob&s;erved that tho&s;e that are mo&s;t di&s;turbed, are commonly &s;uch as know the lea&s;t of the matter. There is no reformation that is ever &s;et on foot, even tho' it be from &s;uch gro&s;s corruptions as Idolatry it&s;elf, but what will cau&s;e di&s;tur|bances, and breed contention. The igno|rance of &s;ome, the prejudice of others, and the wilfulne&s;s of more, will always rai&s;e oppo&s;ition: And what! becau&s;e of this &s;hall we never attempt to reform? we were unworthy the name of Chri&s;tians if we did not. Indeed in matters of little or no con|&s;equence, it is not worth while to di&s;turb the peace of &s;ocieties about them: And whether the thing now pleaded for, is worth <HI>contending</HI> about, I will not determine. &mdash;I hope none are for driving matters to extremity, or making &s;uch a point of it, as to di&s;turb the peace of the &s;ociety:&mdash;But then, <HI>one</HI> way, or the <HI>other</HI> may be mo&s;t agreable to the body of the people, and mo&s;t acceptable to God; and it cannot be ami&s;s to con&s;ider what may be &s;aid on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion: And I hope that every
<PB N="33" REF="012415_0031_0F897536701733F8">one will judge for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and act upon that &s;ide where he &s;ees the greate&s;t light.</P>
<P>As to its being a leading &s;tep to <HI>popery,</HI> and an inlet to <HI>innovations;</HI> there is not the lea&s;t foundation, for &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion: This is only the "Bug-bear of folly," and an out|cry to di&s;turb the minds of others. For what &s;ort of connexion can any one &s;ee, between &s;inging without reading, and popery? They may as well &s;ay that the practice of primitive chri&s;tianity led to popery. And if it is really a reformation in our wor&s;hip, to &s;ing without reading, and a coming nearer to the practice of primitive chri&s;tians, we ought to rejoice in it, and be glad of <HI>&s;uch</HI> innovations every day.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s God has heard the prayers, and accepted the prai&s;es of his people in this land, tho' they have not &s;ung in the manner that is now pleaded for. It is not every irregular practice in his wor&s;hip that will cau&s;e Him who is &s;o infinite in mercy, and ready to pardon to reject the prayers and prai&s;es of his wor&s;hippers. But altho' He has accepted the prai&s;es of his people when performed in a le&s;s &s;uitable manner, it will not from thence follow, that they would not have been more acceptable, if they had been performed in a different manner: And therefore it can be no plea
<PB N="34" REF="012415_0032_0F897537335C9EE0">for continuing <HI>that</HI> practice. Tho' the pray|ers and prai&s;es of a per&s;on not perfectly &s;anctified, may be acceptable to God; yet it would be very wicked for the per&s;on to &s;ay&mdash;that therefore, he will not pre&s;s for|ward towards greater perfection: for cer|tainly the nearer he gets to perfection, the better he performs his duty, and the more acceptably to God.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the main pleas that are made in favor of the pre&s;ent cu&s;tomary way of &s;inging&mdash; <HI>you your&s;elves,</HI> are to judge of the force of them, and of the an&s;wers given to them.</P>
<P>Whether reading is actually an <HI>inter|ruption</HI> in &s;inging&mdash;every one that has any tolerable acquaintance with the rules of &s;inging, cannot but &s;ee that <HI>it is.</HI> The like practice in any other part of divine wor|&s;hip, would be judged, I believe, as a <HI>great</HI> interruption. Should a line of Prayer be read, and then prayed over, and &s;o on&mdash; no one, I pre&s;ume would deny but that reading in that manner, was an interruption to praying: and I &s;ee not, but it is as <HI>much &s;o</HI> in &s;inging&mdash;in both ca&s;es the &s;ong and the prayer, are equally interrupted by the reading</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay that they &s;hould not &s;o &s;trongly object again&s;t the practice of &s;inging
<PB N="35" REF="012415_0033_0F897537F116DD30">without reading, if it was not for the <HI>con|tinuing</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> and <HI>Treble</HI> between the Lines, but <HI>this</HI> is &s;o much of &s;ound with|out &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;ounds &s;o odly and un|couthly to them, that they cannot away with it:&mdash;But &s;uch &s;hould know and con|&s;ider that this <HI>continuing</HI> has its advantages; it keeps the mu&s;ick alive, &s;teadies the tune, and helps the better to &s;trike into the &s;ame pitch again&mdash;and therefore ought not to be found fault with.</P>
<P>After all; whatever the advantages are that accrue by the practice of reading the P&s;alm, line by line as it is &s;ung; yet the di&s;advantages of it another way not yet mentioned, I think, are more than a coun|ter-balance: This practice prevents many people from getting <HI>P&s;alm-books,</HI> which otherwi&s;e they would do: And for want of books in our Families, neither the Heads of families nor children can acquaint them|&s;elves &s;ufficiently with our <HI>P&s;almody,</HI> nor have the benefit of it in their private devo|tions; and this, among chri&s;tians, is a cri|minal omi&s;&s;ion; Our P&s;alm-books are as nece&s;&s;ary in their place, as our Bibles; and it is what is enjoined upon chri&s;tians by an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 16.</NOTE> to teach and admoni&s;h one another, in P&s;alms, Hymns, and Spiri|tual
<PB N="36" REF="012415_0034_0F897538B2FD0638">Songs. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any are de&s;irous of knowing the difference between P&s;alms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs; I &s;hall give it them, as I find them di&s;tingui&s;hed in LEIGH'S <HI>Sacra Critica. P&s;alms,</HI> con|tain exhortation to manners, or holy life. <HI>Hymns,</HI> contain prai&s;es to God, in the commemoration of his Benefits. <HI>Spiritual Songs,</HI> contain Doctrine of the Chief Good or Man's eternal Felicity. A P&s;alm is a Ditty to be play'd upon an In&s;trument; an Hymn is a &s;ong to be uttered with the voice only; an Ode or Song, is a Ditty fitted for either way. See Leigh in Vocibus.</NOTE> Now how we can comply with this duty, and never have p&s;alms nor hymns in our hou&s;es, is hard to conceive. Be&s;ides, children and young People, at their lei&s;ure hours would take delight in reading and committing many of them to memory, which would be of great &s;ervice to them in future life: But for the want of them in our hou&s;es, they are deprived of this pri|viledge. Now &s;o far as the pre&s;ent practice, is an inducement to People to neglect pro|viding them&s;elves with books; &s;o far it is hurtful to Religion&mdash;and their not having books, in&s;tead of being urged as an argu|ment for continuing the practice of read|ing; it is (with me) one of the greate&s;t arguments again&s;t it, as thereby many are induced to neglect their duty in this affair.&mdash; But with regard to the <HI>manner</HI> of &s;inging.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P N="3">3. That we &s;hould carefully attend to the <HI>matter,</HI> as well as the manner of the

The apo&s;tolick direction is to <HI>&s;ing with grace in your hearts to the Lord:</HI> And how &s;kilfully &s;oever we may tune our voices, and how melodious &s;oever our &s;inging may be in the ears of others; yet if the matter that we &s;ing is neglected, and there is no &s;uitable affection working in our hearts towards God&mdash;we are but as "&s;ounding bra&s;s, and a tinkling cymbal;" and we are &s;o far from <HI>making melody</HI> in his ear, that our &s;ong is grating, di&s;cordant and unharmonious; becau&s;e, tho' with our voices we prai&s;e Him, yet our hearts are not right with Him. This is a capital point, and ought to be well con&s;idered; for it is the very Thing that renders our prai&s;es ac|ceptable unto Him: And in vain is our &s;inging if it be not acceptable.&mdash;But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to a word of addre&s;s.&mdash;Fir&s;t, To the &s;ingers in this congregation in particular; and <HI>then,</HI> to the a&s;&s;embly in general&mdash;and &s;o conclude.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>&mdash;To the Singers.&mdash;We rejoice to &s;ee that under the good In&s;tructions which you have lately had, in &s;o &s;hort a time, you have made &s;o great proficiency &mdash;the a&s;&s;iduity and diligence with which you have applied your&s;elves to this laudable and u&s;eful &s;tudy, is much to your honor.
<PB N="38" REF="012415_0036_0F89753A2F7308A0">We flatter our&s;elves, that what we now &s;ee of your talents and accompli&s;hments for church mu&s;ick, is but a faint &s;pecimen of what your further improvements will be a|ble to produce&mdash;you will not re&s;t at tho&s;e mea|&s;ures of knowledge to which you have alrea|dy attained, but pre&s;s forward towards greater perfection; you would do well to keep up your meetings for this purpo&s;e&mdash;but be careful, at the &s;ame time that you do not let one duty infringe upon another; nor pur&s;ue &s;inging &s;o as to neglect prayer, or the duties of your particular callings;&mdash; remember, you are in a world of trouble and temptation, in a &s;tate of trial and pro|bation, where &s;omething el&s;e is to be done, as well as &s;inging; it is only in Heaven that <HI>this</HI> is to be our main employment&mdash; Ob&s;erve &s;uch a decorum in the&s;e things, as that your <HI>good</HI> may not be <HI>evil &s;poken of.</HI>&mdash; It is by <HI>you,</HI> that the mo&s;t &s;ublime part of publick wor&s;hip is to be performed&mdash;God is honoring you, by calling of you to di&s;|charge this duty: In a &s;en&s;e He is making of you, his &s;piritual prie&s;ts, to offer up, in his Church the &s;piritual Sacrifices of prai&s;e unto Him! &s;ee then, that your behavior at all times, corre&s;ponds with &s;o high and ho|norable a character.&mdash;Beware of every &s;in|ful thing&mdash;avoid that which is evil, and
<PB N="39" REF="012415_0037_0F89753BB9DCF148">pur&s;ue that which is good; defile not your&s;elves with any &s;inful impurities, le&s;t, God have no re&s;pect unto your offerings: God requires &s;piritual &s;acrifices; and that tho&s;e who wor&s;hip Him, do it in <HI>&s;pirit and in truth.</HI>&mdash;Don't let it be altogether your concern to have your <HI>voices</HI> rightly tuned, but look at your <HI>hearts</HI> and &s;ee that they are tuned for God's wor&s;hip; &s;ee that you make melody <HI>there</HI> unto Him. If you do not take care to have your Hearts right with Him, all is but a hypocritical oblati|on, which is an abomination unto Him.&mdash; Con&s;ider, how dreadful your ca&s;e will be in the other world, if after you have &s;ung God's prai&s;es, in &s;uch melodious &s;trains with your voices <HI>here,</HI> you &s;hould be for|ever rejected of Him, and &s;ent to howl the doleful notes of the damned in <HI>hell.</HI> The more you reli&s;h the charms of mu&s;ick, the more tormenting will it be to you, to be forever deprived of them&mdash;to be bani&s;hed that company, who &s;hall be forever prai&s;ing God in the mo&s;t rapturous &s;trains of melo|dy.&mdash;See that you live in peace with each other&mdash;you are lovers of concord and har|mony; and it is no le&s;s delightful in a <HI>moral,</HI> than it is in a <HI>mu&s;ical</HI> &s;en&s;e.&mdash;If you meet with no di&s;couragements from the Society, (as I pray God you may not) if that part of divine wor&s;hip is not well per|formed;
<PB N="40" REF="012415_0038_0F89753CB1EF1C90">the blame will lie at your door. Be very careful to give your attendance upon the publick wor&s;hip&mdash;remember, you have a part of it to carry on your&s;elves and there&mdash;

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;To the A&s;&s;embly in general.&mdash; I hope there is none of us, but what wi&s;h well to God's prai&s;es, and rejoice to &s;ee the improvements that are made in our Church mu&s;ick&mdash;and tho' there are &s;ome of us, that have not a talent that way, yet I hope all our hearts are in it: If &s;o, it may be &s;aid of us, as of the "morning &s;tars," they <HI>&s;ang together.</HI> If God has given to any of us a capacity and talent for &s;inging his prai&s;es, together with others, and yet we do not improve it, but let it re&s;t and lie by neg|lected; we are undoubtedly much to be blamed. It concerns us all to examine our talents this way, and to improve them, as we find God has given us ability. We are not to imagine that &s;inging regularly is a u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hment; God has given to men voices, and a capa|city for it, and requires us to wor&s;hip him,
<PB N="41" REF="012415_0039_0F89753D310CDE98">by joining in concert, and &s;inging harmoni|ou&s;ly. But if we can't &s;ing our&s;elves, be-&s;ure we mu&s;t not di&s;courage this work; &s;uch as do it, whatever they think of it now, will at la&s;t be found fighting again&s;t God, and oppo&s;ers of his wor&s;hip: May we all be directed to act in this, and in all other affairs to his Glory.</P>
<P>To conclude. If a few feeble voices very imperfectly tuned, &s;inging in concert here below, are &s;o melodious&mdash;then what will Heaven be? when all the &s;aints on earth, and "the Spirits of the Ju&s;t made perfect," &s;hall join with the <HI>morning &s;tars,</HI> &s;inging and &s;houting forth everla&s;ting prai&s;es to <HI>God and the Lamb,</HI>&mdash;Cherubims and Sera|phims, Men and Women, &s;hall all &s;ing <HI>to|gether</HI> in one grand A&s;&s;embly, and with voices perfectly tuned, &s;hall carry the re&s;|pective <HI>parts</HI> a&s;&s;igned them,&mdash;O! how &s;weet their &s;ong! and how charmed mu&s;t our &s;ouls be, when all at once they &s;trike their harmonious notes, and rai&s;e their voi|ces in lofty &s;trains of melody!&mdash;How &s;ub|lime and &s;olemn the mu&s;ick, as it re&s;ounds from the concave of the third Heavens, and echoes from Pole to Pole.&mdash;May we all be bro't, not only to imagine, but ta&s;te the plea|&s;ure; and with the <HI>morning &s;tars</HI> &s;ing toge|ther&mdash;thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
