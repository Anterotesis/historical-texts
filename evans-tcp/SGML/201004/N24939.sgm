<HEAD>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE <HI>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</HI> IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN in the cour&s;e of human events, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political bands which have con|nected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume among the powers of the earth, the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the opinions of mankind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which im|pel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are en|dowed by their Creator with certain unaliena|ble rights; that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s; that to &s;e|cure the&s;e rights, governments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the con&s;ent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute new government, laying its foundation on &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="033044_0004_0FF62CCFD61FFC78">principles, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to ef|fect their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all ex|perience hath &s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;urpations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;|poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government, and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the patient &s;ufferance of the&s;e Colo|nies; and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con|&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent King of Great-Britain is a hi&s;tory of repeat|ed injuries and u&s;urpations, all having in di|rect object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e States. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a candid world.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his Governors to pa&s;s laws of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and when &s;o &s;u&s;pended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accommodation of large di&s;tricts of people,
<PB N="7" REF="033044_0005_0FF62CD204710620">unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the right of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature, a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to ty|rants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;itory of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them into compliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He has di&s;&s;olved Repre&s;entative Hou&s;es re|peatedly, for oppo&s;ing with manly firmne&s;s his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed for a long time, after &s;uch di&s;&s;olutions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; whereby the legi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the State remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the danger of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu|lation of the&s;e States; for that purpo&s;e ob|&s;tructing the laws for naturalization of for|eigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migrations hither, and rai&s;ing the con|ditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tab|li&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to hara&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033044_0006_0FF62CD4196DC018">
He has kept among us, in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military in|dependent of and &s;uperior to the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a juri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;titution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pretended legi&s;lation:</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;hment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e States:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con|&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the ben|efits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neighbouring Province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarg|ing its boundaries, &s;o as to render it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for introducing the &s;ame ab&s;olute rule into the&s;e Colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering funda|mentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033044_0007_0FF62CD60704E000">
He has abdicated government here, by de|claring us out of his protection, and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is at this time, tran&s;porting large ar|mies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, de&s;olation and tyranny, al|ready begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy, &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t barba|rous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow citizens, ta|ken captive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the execu|tioners of their friends and brethren, or to tall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction of all ages, &s;exes and conditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have petitioned for redre&s;s, in the mo&s;t humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an|&s;wered only by repeated injury. A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Briti&s;h brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts by their
<PB N="10" REF="033044_0008_0FF62CD8C1FE0E38">legi&s;lature to extend an unwarrantable juri&s;|diction over us. We have reminded them of the circum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;et|tlement here. We have appealed to their native ju&s;tice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connexions and corre&s;pondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;an|guinity. We mu&s;t, therefore, acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of man|kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the Repre&s;entatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS a&s;&s;embled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, Do, in the name, and by the authority of the good People of the&s;e Colonies, &s;olemnly publi&s;h and declare, That the&s;e United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, <HI>Free and Independent States;</HI> that they are ab&s;olved from all allegiance to the <HI>Briti&s;h Crown,</HI> and that all political con|nexion between them and the State of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is, and ought to be totally di&s;&s;olved; and that as <HI>Free and Independent States,</HI> they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, e&s;tabli&s;h commerce, and to do all other acts and things which <HI>Inde|pendent States</HI> may of right do. And for the
<PB N="11" REF="033044_0009_0FF62CDACDEB7230">&s;upport of this Declaration, with a firm reli|ance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our &s;acred honour.</P>

<P>ART. III. The &s;aid States hereby &s;everally enter into a firm league of friend&s;hip with each other for their common defence, the &s;ecurity of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare; binding them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other again&s;t all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, &s;overeignty, trade, or any other pretence whatever.</P>

The magnitude of the &s;acrifice mu&s;t depend as well on &s;ituation and circum|&s;tance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with preci&s;ion, the line between tho&s;e rights which mu&s;t be &s;urrendered, and tho&s;e which may be re&s;erved; and on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, this difficulty was increa&s;ed by a difference among the &s;everal States as to their &s;ituation, extent, habits, and particular intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>In all our deliberations on this &s;ubject, we kept &s;teadily in our view, that which appears to us the greate&s;t intere&s;t of every true American, the con&s;olidation of our Union, in which is involved our pro&s;perity, felicity, &s;afety, per|haps our national exi&s;tence. This important con&s;ideration, &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be le&s;s rigid on points of infe|rior magnitude than might have been otherwi&s;e expected; and thus the Con&s;titution which we now pre&s;ent, is the re|&s;ult of a &s;pirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conce&s;&s;ion which the peculiarity of our political &s;ituation rendered indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will

<P>The Convention of a number of the States having, at the time of their adopting the Con&s;titution, expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire, in order to prevent mi&s;con&s;tructions or abu&s;e of its powers, that further declaratory and re&s;trictive clau&s;es &s;hould be added&mdash;and as extending the ground of pub|lic confidence in the government will be&s;t in&s;ure the beneficent ends of its in&s;titution&mdash;</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> BILL OF RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>ARTICLE I.</P>
<P>ALL men are born equally free and independent; therefore all government of right originates from the people, is founded in con&s;ent, and in&s;tituted for the general good.</P>
<P N="2">2. All men have certain natural, e&s;&s;ential and inherent rights&mdash;among which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and protecting property; and in a word, of &s;eeking and obtaining happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. When men enter into a &s;tate of &s;ociety, they &s;urren|der up &s;ome of their natural rights to that &s;ociety, in order to in&s;ure the protection of others; and without &s;uch an equivalent, the &s;urrender is void.</P>
<P N="4">4. Among the natural rights, &s;ome are in their very nature unalienable; becau&s;e no equivalent can be given or received for them: Of this kind are the <HI>Rights of Con|&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to wor&s;hip God according to the dictates of his own con|&s;cience and rea&s;on; and no &s;ubject &s;hall be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re&s;trained, in his per&s;on, liberty, or e&s;tate, for wor&s;hip|ping God in the manner and &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to the dictates of his own con&s;cience, or for his religious profe&s;|&s;ion, &s;entiments, or per&s;ua&s;ion; provided he doth not di&s;|turb the public peace or di&s;turb others in their religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="51" REF="033044_0049_0FF62D33A2655028">
6. As morality and piety, rightly grounded on evangel|ical principles, will give the be&s;t and greate&s;t &s;ecurity to government, and will lay in the hearts of men, the &s;trong|e&s;t obligations to due &s;ubjection; and as the knowledge of the&s;e is mo&s;t likely to be propagated through a &s;ociety, by the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of the Deity, and of public in&s;truction in morality and religion; therefore, to promote tho&s;e important purpo&s;es, the people of this State have a right to empower, and do hereby fully empower the Legi&s;lature, to authori&s;e, from time to time, the &s;eve|ral towns, pari&s;hes, bodies corporate or religious &s;ocieties, within this State, to make adequate provi&s;ion, at their own expen&s;e, for the &s;upport and maintenance of public Prot|e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt teachers of piety, religion and morality.</P>

And no per&s;on of any one particular religious &s;ect or denomination, &s;hall ever be compelled to pay towards the &s;upport of the teacher or teachers of another per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ect or denomination.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Chri&s;tians, demeaning them|&s;elves quietly, and as good &s;ubjects of the State, &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law: And to &s;ubor|dination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>

<P N="7">7. The people of this State have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of governing them&s;elves as a free, &s;overeign and in|dependent State; and do, and forever hereafter &s;hall ex|erci&s;e and enjoy every power, juri&s;diction and right, per|taining thereto, which is not, or may not hereafter be by them expre&s;sly delegated to the United States of America in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P N="8">8. All power re&s;iding originally in, and being derived from the people, all the magi&s;trates and officers of govern|ment are their &s;ub&s;titutes and agents, and at all times ac|countable to them.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="52" REF="033044_0050_0FF62D36099C9A10">

<P N="10">10.

The doctrine of nonre&s;i&s;tance again&s;t arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion, is ab&s;urd, &s;lavi&s;h, and de&s;tructive of the good and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P N="11">11. All elections ought to be free, and every inhabit|ant of the State, having the proper qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ications, has equal right to elect and be elected into office.</P>
<P N="12">12. Every member of the community has a right to be protected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property; he is therefore bound to contribute his &s;hare in the expen&s;e of &s;uch protection, and to yield his per&s;onal &s;ervice when nece&s;&s;ary, or an equivalent. But no part of a man's property &s;hall be taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of the rep|re&s;entative body of the people. Nor are the inhabitants of this State controllable by any other laws than tho&s;e to which they, or their repre&s;entative body, have given their con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="13">13. No per&s;on, who is con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupulous about the lawfulne&s;s of bearing arms, &s;hall be compelled thereto, provided he will pay an equivalent.</P>
<P N="14">14. Every &s;ubject of this State is entitled to a certain remedy, by having recour&s;e to the laws, for all injuries he may receive in his per&s;on, property, or character; to obtain right and ju&s;tice freely, without being obliged to purcha&s;e it; completely and without any denial; promptly and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="15">15. No &s;ubject &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for any crime or offence, until the &s;ame is fully and plainly, &s;abit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly and formally de&s;cribed to him; or be compelied to acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e or furni&s;h evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. And every &s;ubject

And no &s;ubject &s;hall be arre&s;ted, im|pri&s;oned, de&s;poiled, or deprived of his property, immuni|ties, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, ex|iled or deprived of his life, liberty, or e&s;tate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P N="16">16. No &s;ubject &s;hall be liable to be tried, after an ac|quittal, for the &s;ame crime or offence. Nor &s;hall the Le|gi&s;lature make any law that &s;hall &s;ubject any per&s;on to a capital puni&s;hment (excepting for the government of the army and navy, and the militia in actual &s;ervice) without trial by Jury.</P>
<P N="17">17. In criminal pro&s;ecutions, the trial of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of the life, liberty, and e&s;tate of the citizen, that no crime or offence ought to be tried in any other county than that in which it is committed: except in ca&s;es of general in|&s;urrection in any particular county, when it &s;hall appear to the Judges of the Superior Court, that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the offence may be committed, and upon their report, the Legi&s;lature &s;hall think proper to direct the trial in the neare&s;t county in which an impartial trial can be obtained.</P>
<P N="18">18. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the na|ture of the offence. No wi&s;e Legi&s;lature will affix the &s;ame puni&s;hment to the crimes of theft, forgery and the like, which they do to tho&s;e of murder and trea&s;on; where the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;everity is exerted again&s;t all offences, the people are led to forget the real di&s;tinction in the crimes them&s;elves, and to commit the mo&s;t flagrant with as little compunction as they do the lighte&s;t offences: For the &s;ame rea&s;on a multitude of &s;anguinary laws is both impolitic and unju&s;t; the true de&s;ign of all puni&s;hments being to reform, not to exterminate mankind</P>
<P N="19">19. Every &s;ubject hath a right to be &s;ecure from all unrea&s;onable &s;earches and &s;eizures of his per&s;on, his hou&s;es, his papers, and all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Therefore, all warrants to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or arre&s;t a per&s;on for examina|tion or trial, in pro&s;ecutions for criminal matters, are con|trary
<PB N="54" REF="033044_0052_0FF62D39C9763DC0">to this right, if the cau&s;e or foundation of them be not previou&s;ly &s;upported by oath or affirmation; and if the order, in a warrant to a civil officer, to make &s;earch in &s;u&s;pected places, or to arre&s;t one or more &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or to &s;eize their property, be not accompanied with a &s;pe|cial de&s;ignation of the per&s;ons or objects of &s;earch, arre&s;t, or &s;eizure; and no warrant ought to be i&s;&s;ued, but in ca&s;es, and with the formalities, pre&s;cribed by law.</P>
<P N="20">20. In all controver&s;ies concerning property, and in all &s;uits between two or more per&s;ons, except in ca&s;es in which it has been heretofore otherwi&s;e u&s;ed and practi&s;ed, the parties have a right to a trial by Jury, and this method of procedure &s;hall be held &s;acred, unle&s;s in ca&s;es ari&s;ing on the high &s;eas and &s;uch as relate to mariners' wages, the Legi&s;lature &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary hereafter to alter it.</P>
<P N="21">21. In order to reap the fulle&s;t advantage of the in|e&s;timable privilege of the trial by Jury, great care ought to be taken, that none but qualified per&s;ons &s;hould be appoint|ed to &s;erve; and &s;uch ought to be fully compen&s;ated for their travel, time and attendance.</P>
<P N="22">22. The LIBERTY OF THE PRESS is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of freedom in a State: It ought therefore to be inviolably pre&s;erved.</P>
<P N="23">23. Retro&s;pective laws are highly injurious, oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t. No &s;uch laws therefore &s;hould be made, either for the deci&s;ion of civil cau&s;es, or the puni&s;hment of offences.</P>
<P N="24">24. A well regulated militia is the proper, natural and &s;ure defence of a State.</P>
<P N="25">25. Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be rai&s;ed, or kept up without con&s;ent of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="26">26. In all ca&s;es and at all times, the military ought to be under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by the civil power.</P>
<P N="27">27. No &s;oldier in time of peace, &s;hall be quartered in any hou&s;e, without the con&s;ent of the owner; and in time of war, &s;uch qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s ought not to be made but by the civil magi&s;trate, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ordained by the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="28">28. No &s;ub&s;idy, charge, tax, impo&s;t, or duty, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext what|&s;oever,

<P N="30">30.

<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the in&s;titution, maintenance, and admin|i&s;tration of government, is to &s;ecure the exi&s;tence of the body politie, to protect it, and to furni&s;h the individu|als, who compo&s;e it, with the power of enjoying, in &s;afety and tranquillity, their natural rights, and the ble&s;&s;ings of life: and whenever the&s;e great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the government, and to take mea&s;ures, nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety, pro&s;perity, and happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The body politic is formed by a voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of individuals. It is a &s;ocial compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all &s;hall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, there|fore, in framing a Con&s;titution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his &s;ecurity in them.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, acknowl|edging, with grateful hearts, the goodne&s;s of the Great Legi&s;lator of the Univer&s;e, in affording us, in the cour&s;e of his providence, an opportunity, deliberately and peaceably, without fraud, violence, or &s;urpri&s;e, of entering into an

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> A Declaration of Rights, of the Inhabitants of the Com|monwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HEAD>
<P>ART. I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, e&s;&s;ential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defend|ing their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and protecting property; in fine, that of &s;eeking and ob|taining their &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is the right, as well as the duty, of all men in &s;ociety, publickly, and at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, to wor&s;hip the Su|preme Being, the great Creator and Pre&s;erver of the Uni|ver&s;e. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re|&s;trained, in his per&s;on, liberty, or e&s;tate, for wor&s;hipping God in the manner and &s;ea&s;on, mo&s;t agreeable to the dic|tates of his own con&s;cience; or for his religious profe&s;&s;ion or &s;entiments&mdash;provided he doth not di&s;turb the public peace, or ob&s;truct others in their religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happine&s;s of a people, and the good order and pre&s;ervation of civil government, e&s;&s;entially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as tho&s;e cannot be generally diffu&s;ed through a community, but by the in&s;ti|tution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and of public in&s;truc|tions in piety, religion, and morality:&mdash;Therefore, to pro|mote their happine&s;s, and to &s;ecure the good order and pre|&s;ervation of their government, the people of this Common|wealth have a right to inve&s;t their Legi&s;lature with power to authori&s;e and require, and the Legi&s;lature &s;hall, from time to time, authori&s;e and require, the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious &s;ocieties, to
<PB N="81" REF="033044_0079_0FF62D70C0C572E0">make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own expen&s;e, for the in|&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and for the &s;upport and maintenance of public Prote&s;tant teachers of piety, re|ligion, and morality, in all ca&s;es, where &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>And the people of this Commonwealth have al&s;o a right to, and do, inve&s;t their Legi&s;lature with authority, to en|join, upon all the &s;ubjects, an attendance upon the in&s;truc|tions of the public teachers, as afore&s;aid, at &s;tated times and &s;ea&s;ons, if there be any, on who&s;e in&s;tructions they can con&s;cientiou&s;ly and conveniently attend:&mdash;</P>
<P>Provided, notwith&s;tanding, that the &s;everal towns, par|i&s;hes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious &s;ocie|ties, &s;hall, at all times, have the exclu&s;ive right of electing their public teachers, and of contracting with them, for their &s;upport and maintenance.</P>
<P>And all monies, paid by the &s;ubject, to the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip, and of the public teachers afore&s;aid, &s;hall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the &s;upport of the public teacher, or teachers, of his own religious &s;ect or de|nomination, provided there be any, on who&s;e in&s;tructions he attends: otherwi&s;e it may be paid towards the &s;upport of the teacher, or teachers, of the pari&s;h, or precinct, in which the &s;aid monies are rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Chri&s;tians, demeaning them|&s;elves peaceably, and as good &s;ubjects of the Commonwealth. &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law: and no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The people of this Commonwealth have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of governing them&s;elves, as a free, &s;ov|ereign, and independent State; and do, and forever here|after &s;hall, exerci&s;e and enjoy every power, juri&s;diction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them ex|pre&s;sly delegated to the United States of America, in Con|gre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P N="5">V. All power re&s;iding originally in the people, and being derived from them, the &s;everal magi&s;trates, and officers of government, ve&s;ted with authority, whether legi&s;lative, ex|ecutive, or judicial, are their &s;ub&s;titutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="82" REF="033044_0080_0FF62D72716AC1C0">
VI. No man, or corporation, or a&s;&s;ociation of men, have any other title, to obtain advantages, or particular and exclu&s;ive privileges, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the commu|nity, than what ari&s;es from the con&s;ideration of &s;ervices, rendered to the public. And this title being, in nature, neither hereditary, nor tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible to children, or de|&s;cendants, or relations by blood,&mdash;the idea of a man, born a magi&s;trate, lawgiver, or judge, is ab&s;urd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Government is in&s;tituted for the common good; for the protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private intere&s;t of any one man, family, or cla&s;s of men. Therefore, the people alone have an inconte&s;table, unalienable, and inde|fea&s;ible right, to in&s;titute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the &s;ame, when their protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s, require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In order to prevent tho&s;e, who are ve&s;ted with authority, from becoming oppre&s;&s;ors, the people have a right, at &s;uch periods, and in &s;uch manner, as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by their frame of government, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> their public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. All elections ought to be free; and all the inhab|itants of this Commonwealth, having &s;uch qualifications, as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X. Each individual of the &s;ociety has a right to be pro|tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and prop|erty, according to &s;tanding laws. He is obliged, con&s;e|quently, to contribute his &s;hare to the expen&s;e of this pro|tection; to give his per&s;onal &s;ervice, or an equivalent, when nece&s;&s;ary. But no part of the property of any in|dividual can, with ju&s;tice, be taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of the re|pre&s;entative body of the people. In fine, the people of this Commonwealth are not controllable by any other laws, than tho&s;e, to which their con&s;titutional repre&s;entative body have given their con&s;ent. And whenever the public exi|gencies require, that the property of any individual &s;hould be appropriated to public u&s;es, he &s;hall receive a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation therefor.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="83" REF="033044_0081_0FF62D745BE1D910">
XI. Every &s;ubject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recour&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e laws, for all injuries or wrongs, which he may receive, in his per&s;on, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and ju&s;tice freely, and without being obliged to purcha&s;e it&mdash;completely, and without any denial&mdash;promptly, and with|out delay&mdash;conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. No &s;ubject &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for any crime or offence, until the &s;ame is fully and plainly, &s;ub&s;tantially and formally, de&s;cribed to him; or be compelled to accu&s;e, or furni&s;h evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. And every &s;ubject &s;hall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa|vourable to him; to meet the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, face to face; and to be fully heard in his defence, by him&s;elf, or his coun&s;el, at his election. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be arre&s;ted, impri&s;oned, de&s;poiled, or deprived of his proper|ty, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or e&s;tate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>And the Legi&s;lature &s;hall not make any law, that &s;hall &s;ubject any per&s;on to a capital or infamous puni&s;hment, (excepting for the government of the army and navy) without trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In criminal pro&s;ecutions, the verification of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greate&s;t &s;ecurities of the life, liberty and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Every &s;ubject has a right to be &s;ecure from all unrea&s;onable &s;earches, and &s;eizures, of his per&s;on, his hou&s;es, his papers, and all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cau&s;e or founda|tion of them be not previou&s;ly &s;upported by oath or affirm|ation; and if the order, in a warrant, to a civil officer, to make &s;earch in all &s;u&s;pected places, or to arre&s;t one or more &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or to &s;eize their property, be not accom|panied with a &s;pecial de&s;ignation of the per&s;ons or objects of &s;earch, arre&s;t, or &s;eizure. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o warrant ought to be i&s;&s;ued, but in ca&s;es, and with the formalities, pre&s;cribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. In all controver&s;ies concerning property, and in all &s;uits between two or more per&s;ons, (except in ca&s;es, in which it has heretofore been otherwi&s;e u&s;ed and practi&s;ed)
<PB N="84" REF="033044_0082_0FF62D75E6DEB2E8">the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure &s;hall be held &s;acred; unle&s;s, in cau&s;es ari&s;ing on the high &s;eas, and &s;uch as relate to mariners' wages, the Legi&s;lature &s;hall hereafter find it nece&s;&s;ary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The liberty of the pre&s;s is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of freedom in a State; it ought not, therefore, to be re|&s;trained in this Commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained, without the con&s;ent of the Legi&s;lature; and the military power &s;hall always be held in exact &s;ubordina|tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin|ciples of the Con&s;titution, and a con&s;tant adherence to tho&s;e of piety, ju&s;tice, moderation, temperance, indu&s;try, and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve the ad|vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, con&s;equently, to have a particular at|tention to all tho&s;e principles, in the choice of their officers and repre&s;entatives: and they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magi&s;trates, an exact and con&s;tant ob|&s;ervance of them, in the formation and execution of all laws, nece&s;&s;ary for the good admini&s;tration of the Com|monwealth.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peace|able manner, to a&s;&s;emble to con&s;ult upon the common good; give in&s;tructions to their repre&s;entatives; and to reque&s;t of the legi&s;lative body, by the way of addre&s;&s;es, pe|titions, or remon&s;trances, redre&s;s of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they &s;uffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The power of &s;u&s;pending the laws, or the execu|tion of the laws, ought never to be exerci&s;ed, but by the Legi&s;lature; or, by authority derived from it, to be exer|ci&s;ed in &s;uch particular ca&s;es only, as the Legi&s;lature &s;hall expre&s;sly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, &s;peech, and debate, in either Hou&s;e of the Legi&s;lature, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accu&s;ation or pro&s;ecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="85" REF="033044_0083_0FF62D78A71C5058">
XXII. The Legi&s;lature ought frequently to a&s;&s;emble, for the redre&s;s of grievances, for correcting, &s;trengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>

<P>CONNECTICUT is divided into &s;ix counties, and each county is divided into a number of towns. Each town has a right to &s;end two Repre&s;entatives to the Gen|eral Court or A&s;&s;embly. The General Court con&s;i&s;ts of two branches, called the Upper and Lower Hou&s;e.

This Court has the &s;ole power to make and rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al laws, grant levies, di&s;po&s;e of lands belonging to the State, to particular towns and per&s;ons; to erect and &s;tyle judicatories and officers, as they &s;hall &s;ee nece&s;&s;ary, for the good government of the people; al&s;o to call to account any court, magi&s;trate, or other officer, for any mi&s;demean|or and mal-admini&s;tration; and for ju&s;t cau&s;e, may &s;ine, di&s;place, or remove them, or deal otherwi&s;e, as the na|ture of the ca&s;e &s;hall require; and deal or act in any other matter, that concerns the good of the State, except the election of Governor, Deputy-Governor, A&s;&s;i&s;tants, Trea&s;|urer, and Secretary, which &s;hall be done by the freemen, at the yearly court of election, unle&s;s there be any va|cancy, by rea&s;on of death or otherwi&s;e, after the election, which may be filled up by the General Court. This Court has power al&s;o, for rea&s;ons &s;atisfactory to them, to grant &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, relea&s;e, and jail delivery upon reprieve in capital and criminal ca&s;es.

The Governor, or, in his ab&s;ence, the Deputy-Gover|nor, may call the A&s;&s;embly, on &s;pecial emergencies, to meet at any other time. The Governor, Deputy-Governor, A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and Secretary, are annually elected, on the &s;ec|ond Thur&s;day in May. The Repre&s;entatives are newly cho&s;en for each &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion. The Judges and Ju&s;tices are annually appointed by the General Court; the &s;ame per&s;ons are commonly re-appointed, from time to time, during their capacity to &s;erve, unle&s;s guilty of mi&s;behaviour. The Sheriffs are appointed by the Governor and Council, without limitation of time; but may be &s;uper&s;eded, by the authority that appoints them. The Governor, for the time being, is captain general of the militia; the Deputy-Governor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the field officers, are appointed by the General Court, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the Governor. The captains and &s;ubal|terns are cho&s;en by the vote of the Company and hou&s;e|holders, living within the limits of the Company; the per|&s;ons, &s;o cho&s;en, mu&s;t be approved by the General Court, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the Governor, before they have pow|er to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the plea&s;ure of the A&s;&s;embly; nor can they re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks, as private &s;oldiers.

<P N="11">XI. That retro&s;pective laws, puni&s;hing offences com|mitted before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, are oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t, and ought not to be made.</P>
<P N="12">XII.

<P N="16">XVI. That exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required, nor exce&s;&s;ive &s;ines impo&s;ed, nor cruel nor unu&s;ual puni&s;h|ments inflicted.</P>
<P N="17">XVII.

<P N="18">XVIII. That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and &s;afe defence of a free government.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That &s;tanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be rai&s;ed or kept up, without the con|&s;ent of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="20">XX. That, in all ca&s;es, and at all times, the military ought to be under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That no &s;oldier ought to be quartered in any hou&s;e, in time of peace, without the con&s;ent of the owner; and in time of war, in &s;uch manner only, as the Legi&s;lature &s;hall direct.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. That the independency and uprightne&s;s of Judges are e&s;&s;ential to the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice, and a great &s;ecurity to the rights and liberties of the people.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. That the liberty of the pre&s;s ought to be in|violably pre&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, &amp;.</HEAD>
<P>THE parliament of Great Britain, by a declaratory act, having a&s;&s;umed a right to make laws to bind the Colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and, in pur&s;uance of &s;uch claim, endeavoured, by force of arms, to &s;ubjugate the United Colonies to an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their will and power, and having at length con&s;trained them to declare them&s;elves independent States, and to a&s;&s;ume government under the authority of the people;&mdash;Therefore we, the Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Convention a&s;&s;em|bled, taking into our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the be&s;t means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a good Con&s;titution in this State, for the &s;ure foundation and more permanent &s;ecurity thereof, declare,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That all government of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and in&s;tituted &s;olely for the good of the whole.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That the people of this State ought to have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of regulating the internal govern|ment and police thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, accord|ing to the cour&s;e of that law, and to the benefit of &s;uch of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes, as exi&s;ted at the time of their fir&s;t em|igration, and which, by experience, have been found ap|plicable to their local and other circum&s;tances, and of &s;uch others as have been &s;ince made in England, or Great

<ITEM>IV. That all per&s;ons inve&s;ted with the legi&s;lative or executive powers of government are the tru&s;tees of the public, and, as &s;uch, accountable for their conduct; where|fore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manife&s;tly endangered, and all other means of redre&s;s are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or e&s;tabli&s;h a new government.

<ITEM>V. That the right in the people to participate in the Legi&s;lature, is the be&s;t &s;ecurity of liberty, and the founda|tion of all free government; for this purpo&s;e, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man, having prop|erty in, a common intere&s;t with, and an attachment to the community, ought to have a right of &s;uffrage.</ITEM>

<ITEM>IX. That a place for the meeting of the Legi&s;lature ought to be fixed, the mo&s;t convenient to the members thereof, and to the depo&s;itory of public records; and the Legi&s;lature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident nece&s;&s;ity.</ITEM>

<ITEM>XV. That retro&s;pective laws, puni&s;hing facts com|mitted before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppre&s;&s;ive, unju&s;t, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law ought to be made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVI. That no law, to attaint particular per&s;ons of trea&s;on or felony, ought to be made in any ca&s;e, or any time hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVII.

<ITEM>XX. That no man ought to be compelled to give evi|dence again&s;t him&s;elf, in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in &s;uch ca&s;es as have been u&s;ually practi&s;ed in this State, or may hereafter be directed by the Legi&s;lature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXI. That no freeman ought to be taken, or impri&s;|oned, or di&s;&s;eized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner de&s;troyed, or de|prived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</ITEM>

<ITEM>XXVIII. That no &s;oldier ought to be quartered in any hou&s;e, in time of peace, without the con&s;ent of the owner; and in time of war, in &s;uch manner only, as the Legi&s;lature &s;hall direct.</ITEM>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE, the Delegates and Repre&s;entatives of the good people of Virginia, do declare the future form of government of Virginia to be as followeth:</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary department, &s;hall be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, &s;o that neither exerci&s;e the powers properly belonging to the other: nor &s;hall any per|&s;on exerci&s;e the powers of more than one of them, at the &s;ame time; except that the Ju&s;tices of the County Courts &s;hall be eligible to either Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative &s;hall be formed of two di&s;tinct branches, who, together, &s;hall be a complete Legi&s;lature. They &s;hall meet once, or oftener, every year, and &s;hall be called, <HI>The General A&s;&s;embly of Virginia.</HI> One of the&s;e &s;hall be called, <HI>The Hou&s;e of Delegate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and con&s;i&s;t of two Repre|&s;entatives, to be cho&s;en for each county, and for the di&s;|trict of We&s;t-Augu&s;ta, annually, of &s;uch men as act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly re&s;ide in, and are freeholders of the &s;ame, or duly qualified according to law, and al&s;o of one Delegate or Repre&s;ent|ative, to be cho&s;en annually for the city of Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ourgh, and one for the borough of Norfolk, and a Repre&s;entative for each of &s;uch other cities and boroughs, as may here|after be allowed particular repre&s;entation by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">a|ture; but when any city or borough &s;hall &s;o decrea&s;e, as that the number of per&s;ons, having right of &s;uffrage therein,
<PB N="210" REF="033044_0208_0FF62E7AD225C468">&s;hall have been, for the &s;pace of &s;even years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, le&s;s than half the number of voters in &s;ome one county in Virginia, &s;uch city or borough thenceforward &s;hall cea&s;e to &s;end a Delegate or Repre&s;entative to the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The other &s;hall be called <HI>The Senate,</HI> and con&s;i&s;t of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen &s;hall con&s;titute a Hou&s;e to proceed on bu&s;ine&s;s; for who&s;e election, the dif|ferent counties &s;hall be divided into twenty-four di&s;tricts; and each county of the re&s;pective di&s;trict, at the time of the election of its Delegates, &s;hall vote for one Senator, who is actually a re&s;ident and freeholder within the di&s;trict, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the Sheriffs of each county, within five days at farthe&s;t, after the la&s;t county election in the di&s;trict, &s;hall meet at &s;ome convenient place, and from the poll, &s;o taken in their re&s;pective counties, return, as a Senator, the man who &s;hall have the greate&s;t number of votes in the whole di&s;trict. To keep up this A&s;&s;embly by rotation, the di&s;|tricts &s;hall be equally divided into four cla&s;&s;es and number|ed by lot. At the end of one year after the general elec|tion, the &s;ix members, elected by the fir&s;t divi&s;ion, &s;hall be di&s;placed, and the vacancies thereby occa&s;ioned &s;upplied from &s;uch cla&s;s or divi&s;ion, by new election, in the manner afore&s;aid. This rotation &s;hall be applied to each divi&s;ion, according to its number, and continued in due order annu|ally.</P>
<P>The right of &s;uffrage in the election of members for both Hou&s;es &s;hall remain as exerci&s;ed at pre&s;ent; and each Hou&s;e &s;hall choo&s;e its own Speaker, appoint its own offi|cers, &s;ettle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election, for the &s;upplying intermediate vacancies.</P>
<P>All laws &s;hall originate in the Hou&s;e of Delegates, to be approved of or rejected by the Senate, or to be amended, with con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Delegates; except money-bills, which in no in&s;tance &s;hall be altered by the Senate, but wholly approved or rejected.</P>
<P>A Governor, or chief magi&s;trate, &s;hall be cho&s;en annu|ally by joint ballot of both Hou&s;es (to be taken in each Hou&s;e re&s;pectively) depo&s;ited in the conference room; the boxes examined jointly by a committee of each Hou&s;e, and the numbers &s;everally reported to them, that the appoint|ments

An adequate, but mod|erate &s;alary &s;hall be &s;ettled on him, during his continuance in office; and he &s;hall, with the advice of a Council of State, exxrci&s;e the executive powers of government, ac|cording to the laws of this Commonwealth; and &s;hall not, under any pretence, exerci&s;e any power or prerogative, by virtue of any law, &s;tatute or cu&s;tom of England.

<P>Either Hou&s;e of the General A&s;&s;embly may adjourn them&s;elves re&s;pectively. The Governor &s;hall not prorogue or adjourn the A&s;&s;embly, during their &s;itting, nor di&s;&s;olve them at any time; but he &s;hall, if nece&s;&s;ary, either by ad|vice of the Council of State, or on application of a majori|ty of the Hou&s;e of Delegates, call them before the time to which they &s;hall &s;tand prorogued or adjourned.</P>
<P>A Privy Council, or Council of State, con&s;i&s;ting of eight members, &s;hall be cho&s;en, by joint ballot of both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, either from their own members or the people at large, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the admini&s;tration of government. They &s;hall annually choo&s;e, out of their own members, a Pre&s;i|dent, who, in ca&s;e of death, inability, or ab&s;ence of the Governor from the government, &s;hall act as Lieutenant-Governor. Four members &s;hall be &s;ufficient to act, and their advice and proceedings &s;hall be entered on record, and &s;igned by the members pre&s;ent, (to any part whereof, any member may enter his di&s;&s;ent) to be laid before the General A&s;&s;embly, when called for by them. This Coun|cil may appoint their own Clerk, who &s;hall have a &s;alary &s;ettled by law, and take an oath of &s;ecrecy, in &s;uch matters as he &s;hall be directed by the board to conceal. A &s;um of money, appropriated to that purpo&s;e, &s;hall be divided annually among the members, in proportion to their attend|ance;
<PB N="212" REF="033044_0210_0FF62E80193FD630">and they &s;hall be incapable, during their continu|ance in office, of &s;itting in either Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly.

<P>The Delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congre&s;s &s;hall be cho&s;en annually, or &s;uper&s;eded in the mean time, by joint ballot of both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent militia officers &s;hall be continued, and va|cancies &s;upplied by appointment of the Governor, with the advice of the Privy-Council, on recommendations from the re&s;pective County Courts; but the Governor and Coun|cil &s;hall have a power of &s;u&s;pending any officer, and order|ing a Court Martial, on complaint of mi&s;behaviour or ina|bility, or to &s;upply vacancies of officers, happening when in actual &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Governor may embody the militia, with the advice of the Privy Council; and when embodied, &s;hall alone have the direction of the militia, under the laws of the country.</P>
<P>The two Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly &s;hall, by joint ballot, ap|point Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and Gen|eral Court, Judges in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and the Attorney General, to be commi&s;&s;ioned by the Governor, and continue in office during good beha|viour. In ca&s;e of death, incapacity, or re&s;ignation, the Governor, with the advice of the Privy Council, &s;hall ap|point per&s;ons to &s;ucceed in office, to be approved or di&s;|placed by both Hou&s;es.

The pre&s;ent and future Clerks &s;hall hold their offices during good behaviour, to be judged of, and determined in the General Court.

<P>WHEREAS all government ought to be in&s;tituted and &s;upported for the &s;ecurity and protection of the community as &s;uch, and to enable the individuals, who com|po&s;e it, to enjoy their natural rights, and the other ble&s;&s;ings which the Author of exi&s;tence has be&s;towed upon man: and whenever tho&s;e great ends of government are not ob|tained, the people have a right, by common con&s;ent, to change it, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures as to them may appear nece&s;&s;ary, to promote their &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And whereas the inhabitants of this State have (in con|&s;ideration of protection only) heretofore acknowledged al|legiance to the King of Great-Britain: and the &s;aid King has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced and &s;till continues to carry on, with unabated vengeance, a mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t war again&s;t them; employing there|in not only the troops of Great-Britain, but foreign merce|naries, &s;avages, and &s;laves, for the avowed purpo&s;e of re|ducing them to a total and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the de&s;potic domination of the Briti&s;h Parliament, with many more acts of tyranny, (more fully &s;et forth in the Declaration of Con|gre&s;s) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the &s;aid King and his Succe&s;&s;ors, are di&s;&s;olved and at an end; and all power and authority derived from him cea&s;ed in the Amer|ican Colonies. And whereas the Territory, which now comprehends the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New-Hamp&s;hire, and the former Governor thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> granted many charters of lands and cor|porations within this State to the pre&s;ent inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Col|den, of New York, with others, did, in violation of the tenth command, covet tho&s;e very lands: and by a fal&s;e
<PB N="247" REF="033044_0245_0FF62ECE0C143578">repre&s;entation, made to the Court of Great-Britain, (in the year 1764, that for the convenience of trade and admini&s;|tration of ju&s;tice, the inhabitants were de&s;irous of being an|nexed to that government) obtained juri&s;diction of tho&s;e very identical lands, <HI>ex parte,</HI> which ever was and is di&s;a|greeable to the inhabitants. And whereas the Legi&s;lature of New-York ever have, and &s;till continue to di&s;own the good people of this State, in their landed property, which will appear in the complaints hereafter in&s;erted, and in the 36th &s;ection of their pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, in which is e&s;tab|li&s;hed the Grants of Land made by that government.</P>
<P>They have refu&s;ed to make re-grants of our lands to the original Proprietors and Occupants, unle&s;s at the exorbi|tant rate of 2,300 dollars fees for each town&s;hip; and did enhance the quitrent three-fold, and demanded an immedi|ate delivery of the title derived from New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>The Judges of their Supreme Court have made a &s;ol|emn declaration, that the charters, conveyances, &amp;c. of the lands included in the before-de&s;cribed premi&s;es, were ut|terly null and void, on which &s;aid title was founded. In con&s;equence of which declaration, writs of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion have been by them i&s;&s;ued, and the Sheriff of the county of Al|bany &s;ent at the head of &s;ix or &s;even hundred men, to en|force the execution thereof.</P>
<P>They have pa&s;&s;ed an act, annexing a penalty thereto, of thirty pounds' fine, and &s;ix months' impri&s;onment, on any per&s;on who &s;hould refu&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Sheriff, after being reque&s;ted, for the purpo&s;e of executing writs of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Governors Dunmore, Tryon, and Colden, have made re-grants of &s;everal tracts of land included in the premi&s;es, to certain favourite land jobbers in the government of New-York, in direct violation of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s prohibition, in the year 1767.</P>
<P>They have i&s;&s;ued proclamations, wherein they have of|fered large &s;ums of money for the purpo&s;e of apprehending tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who have dared boldly and publickly to appear in defence of their ju&s;t rights.</P>
<P>They did pa&s;s twelve acts of outlawry on the ninth day of March, A. D. 1774, empowering the re&s;pective Judges of their Supreme Court to award execution of death again&s;t tho&s;e inhabitants in &s;aid di&s;trict, that they &s;hould judge to be offenders, without trial.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="033044_0246_0FF62ECFD021DA30">
They have and &s;till continue an unju&s;t claim to tho&s;e lands, which greatly retards emigration into any &s;ettlement of this State.</P>

<P>The free Convention of the State of New-York, at Har|lem, in the year 1776, unanimou&s;ly voted, "That all quit|rents, formerly due to the King of Great-Britain, are now due, and owing to this Convention, or &s;uch future govern|ment as &s;hall be hereafter e&s;tabli&s;hed in this State."</P>
<P>In the &s;everal &s;tages of the afore&s;aid oppre&s;&s;ions, we have petitioned his Britannic Maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t humble manner for redre&s;s, and have, at very great expen&s;e, re|ceived &s;everal reports in our favour: and in other in&s;tances, wherein we have petitioned the late legi&s;lative authority of New-York, tho&s;e petitions have been treated with ne|glect.

<P>Therefore it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the welfare and &s;afety of the inhabitants of this State, that it &s;hould be henceforth a free and independent State, and that a ju&s;t, permanent, and proper form of government &s;hould exi&s;t in it, derived from and founded on the authority of the peo|ple only, agreeable to the direction of the honourable American Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>We the Repre&s;entatives of the freemen of Vermont, in General Convention met, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of form|ing &s;uch a government&mdash;confe&s;&s;ing the goodne&s;s of the great Governor of the univer&s;e (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happine&s;s mankind may attain by per|fecting the arts of government) in permitting the people

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> A <HI>DECLARATION</HI> of the <HI>RIGHTS</HI> of the <HI>IN|HABITANTS</HI> of the <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>VERMONT.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights; among&s;t which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty&mdash;acquiring, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and protecting property&mdash;and pur&s;uing and obtaining happine&s;s and &s;afety. Therefore, no male per&s;on, born in this country, or brought from over &s;ea, ought to be holden by law to &s;erve any per&s;on, as a &s;ervant, &s;lave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after &s;he arrives to the age of eighteen years; unle&s;s they are bound by their own con&s;ent after they arrive to &s;uch age; or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, co&s;ts, or the like.</P>
<P N="2">II. That private property ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient to pub|lic u&s;es, when nece&s;&s;ity requires it; neverthele&s;s, when|ever
<PB N="250" REF="033044_0248_0FF62ED489B69668">any particular man's property is taken for the u&s;e of the public, the owner ought to receive an equivalent in money.</P>
<P N="3">III. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to wor&s;hip Almighty God according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences and under&s;tandings, as in their opin|ion &s;hall be regulated by the word of God; and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any re|ligious wor&s;hip, or erect or &s;upport any place of wor&s;hip, or maintain any mini&s;ter, contrary to the dictates of his con&s;cience; nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious &s;entiments, or peculiar mode of religious wor&s;hip; and that no authority can, or ought to be ve&s;ted in, or a&s;&s;umed by any power what&s;oever, that &s;hall in any ca&s;e interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of con&s;cience, in the free exerci&s;e of religious wor&s;hip: Nev|erthele&s;s, every &s;ect or denomination of Chri&s;tians ought to ob&s;erve the Sabbath or Lord's day, and keep up &s;ome &s;ort of religious wor&s;hip, which to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t agree|able to the revealed will of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Every per&s;on within this Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recour&s;e to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his per&s;on, property, or character: he ought to obtain right and ju&s;tice freely, and without being obliged to purcha&s;e it&mdash;completely, and without any denial&mdash;promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the people of this State, by their legal repre|&s;entatives, have the &s;ole, exclu&s;ive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That all power being originally inherent in, and con&s;equently derived from the people; therefore, all officers of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That government is, or ought to be, in&s;tituted for the common benefit, protection and &s;ecurity of the people, nation, or community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any &s;ingle man, family, or &s;et of men, who are a part only of that community: and that the commu|nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefea&s;ible right, to reform or alter government, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be,
<PB N="251" REF="033044_0249_0FF62ED6A057DC88">by that community, judged to be mo&s;t conducive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That tho&s;e who are employed in the legi&s;lative and executive bu&s;ine&s;s of the State may be re&s;trained from oppre&s;&s;ion, the people have a right, by their legal repre&s;en|tatives, to enact laws for reducing their public officers to a private &s;tation, and for &s;upplying their vacancies in a con|&s;titutional manner, by regular elections, at &s;uch periods as they may think proper.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That all elections ought to be free and without corruption; and that all freemen, having a &s;ufficient evi|dent common intere&s;t with, and attachment to the commu|nity, have a right to elect officers, and be elected into office.</P>
<P N="10">X. That every member of &s;ociety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property; and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expen&s;e of that protection, and yield his per&s;onal &s;ervice, when nece&s;&s;ary, or an equivalent thereto: but no part of a man's property can be ju&s;tly taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of the repre|&s;entative body of the freemen; nor can any man, who is con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupulous of bearing arms, be ju&s;tly com|pelled thereto, if he will pay &s;uch equivalent; nor are the people bound by any law, but &s;uch as they have in like manner a&s;&s;ented to, for their common good. And previ|ous to any law being made to rai&s;e a tax, the purpo&s;e, for which it is to be rai&s;ed ought to appear evident to the Le|gi&s;lature to be of more &s;ervice to the community, than the money would be if not collected.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That in all pro&s;ecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his coun&s;el&mdash; to demand the cau&s;e and nature of his accu&s;ation&mdash;to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es&mdash;to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous con&s;ent of which jury he cannot be found guilty&mdash;nor can he be compelled to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf&mdash;nor can any man be ju&s;tly de|prived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That the people have a right to hold them&s;elves, their hou&s;es, papers and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, free from &s;earch or &s;eizure: and therefore warrants, without oaths or affirma|tions
<PB N="252" REF="033044_0250_0FF62ED8599E1EE8">fir&s;t made, affording &s;ufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or me&s;&s;enger may be commanded or required to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to &s;eize any per|&s;on or per&s;ons, his, her or their property not particularly de&s;cribed, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That no warrant or writ to attach the per&s;on or e&s;tate of any freeholder within this State, &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued in civil action, without the per&s;on or per&s;ons, who may re|que&s;t &s;uch warrant or attachment, fir&s;t make oath, or affirm before the authority who may be reque&s;ted to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame, that he or they are in danger of lo&s;ing his, her, or their debts.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That when an i&s;&s;ue in fact, proper for the cog|nizance of a jury, is joined in a court of law, the parties have a right to a trial by jury; which ought to be held &s;acred.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That the people have a right of fredom of &s;peech and of writing and publi&s;hing their &s;entiments, concerning the tran&s;actions of government&mdash;and therefore the freedom of the pre&s;s ought not to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The freedom of deliberation, &s;peech, and debate, in the legi&s;lature, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accu&s;ation or pro&s;e|cution, action or complaint, in any other court or place what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The power of &s;u&s;pending laws, or the execution of laws, ought never to be exerci&s;ed, but by the Legi&s;lature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerci&s;ed in &s;uch particular ca&s;es only as the Legi&s;lature &s;hall expre&s;sly pro|vide for.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defence of them&s;elves and the State: and as &s;tand|ing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military &s;hould be kept under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by the civil power.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That no per&s;on in this Commonwealth can, in any ca&s;e, be &s;ubjected to law-martial or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except tho&s;e employed in the army, and the militia in actual &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="253" REF="033044_0251_0FF62EDB42906AF8">
XX. That frequent recurrence to fundamental princi|ples, and a firm adherence to ju&s;tice, moderation, temper|ance, indu&s;try, and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and keep government free; the people ought therefore to pay particular attention to the&s;e points, in the choice of officers and repre&s;entatives; and have a right, in a legal way, to exact a due and con|&s;tant regard to them, from their legi&s;lators and magi&s;trates, in the making and executing &s;uch laws as are nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the State.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That all people have a natural and inherent right to emigrate from one State to another, that will receive them; or to form a new State in vacant countries, or in &s;uch countries as they can purcha&s;e, whenever they think that thereby they can promote their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. That the people have a right to a&s;&s;emble togeth|er, to con&s;ult for their common good&mdash;to in&s;truct their re|pre&s;entatives, and to apply to the Legi&s;lature for redre&s;s of grievances, by addre&s;s, petition or remon&s;trance.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. That no per&s;on &s;hall be liable to be tran&s;ported out of this State, for trial for any offence committed within the &s;ame.</P>
