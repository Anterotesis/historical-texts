<Q><P>FOR EVERY HOUSE IS BUILDED BY SOME MAN; BUT HE THAT BUILT ALL THINGS IS GOD.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;ubordination of events, and of things, for the purpo&s;e of illu&s;trating objects more noble, is acknowledged in the &s;everal branches of ethics and of philo&s;ophy. Reli|gion, of every name, in ancient and in mod|ern times, hath cho&s;en to illu&s;trate her my&s;te|ries, through the medium of &s;ubordinate re|lations. That revealed religion &s;hould have cho&s;en this mode of communication is no mat|ter of &s;urpri&s;e. It needed things vi&s;ible and material, through which to communicate, and by which to illu&s;trate her hidden my&s;teries. The unfolding of the&s;e my&s;teries hath given honorable employment to the pen of the learned, and poured unction upon the tongue of the eloquent, in every age.</P>
<P>BESIDES the accomodation of giving em|ployment; the u&s;e of figures, as &s;ubordinate expre&s;&s;ions of immaterial realities, hath been of high moment; affording a mode of com|munication which, always kept the learner, at a di&s;tance from the in&s;tructor. The u&s;e of
<PB N="6" REF="035127_0004_1000C02705A6BF30">figures, by men, in early days aro&s;e from as imitation of the copy, given, in le&s;&s;ons of di|vine in&s;truction.</P>
<P>BOTH natural and revealed religion ac|knowledge their indebtedne&s;s to figures. The former draws its in&s;truction, and maintains its propo&s;itions by an immediate appeal to vi&s;ible objects. It declares from the things that are made, and from the events which revolve, that the invi&s;ible hand is &s;een. This revealed religion doth not deny. Giving, however, the preference to the written word, it points to the works of creation and to the events of Providence, as &s;ubordinate, yet confirming te&s;timonials of the truths, it hath, in the fairer pages of in&s;piration, already received. And whil&s;t this general doctrine is received, the well in&s;tructed and philo&s;ophic chri&s;tian, with great delight, di&s;tributes wi&s;dom, from the corre&s;pondency he di&s;cerns, between things &s;een by the natural eye, and things taught in the &s;acred page. This corre&s;pondency &s;een and illu&s;trated, mightily confirms the duplex operation of the Creators hand. Whil&s;t he is teaching, to the &s;ons of men, le&s;&s;ons of in|&s;truction, from a view of things that are made; the believer is delighted to hear of the &s;ame truths, delivered, with confirming, and all conquering evidence, at the feet of our Go&s;pel Gamaliel.</P>
<P>STILL the mo&s;t &s;trenuous, in defence of revealed religion, are by no means deprived of the &s;ources of inquiry, from which to ob|tain employment, and from which to draw
<PB N="7" REF="035127_0005_1000C029EC38ADC0">le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction which figurative objects give. The&s;e figures are &s;trowed, with a pro|fu&s;e hand, throughout the &s;acred page, as well as through the works of GOD.</P>
<P>THE writer, from who&s;e pen, fell the pa&s;|&s;age before us, was, at this moment, bu&s;ying him&s;elf with figurative language and figura|tive things. His de&s;ign was to illu&s;trate the nature of the Mo&s;aic economy as a figure. He in&s;i&s;ts on its con&s;ummation; proves its &s;ubordination to the Go&s;pel Temple which was now to be &s;et up, and before which, this build|ing of Mo&s;es was to fade as the morning &s;tar withdraws, as the day dawns, and the &s;un ad|vances. This &s;ubordination is argued from the inferiority of Mo&s;es the Builder, to the Son the Proprietor. The fidelity of the greater in the higher order is in&s;i&s;ted on, and illu&s;trated by the faithfulne&s;s of Mo&s;es, in the figure.&mdash; "For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Mo&s;es ina&s;much, as he who hath builded the hou&s;e hath more honor than the hou&s;e: For every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man, but he that built all things is GOD."</P>
<P>THESE general ob&s;ervations, on the SUB|ORDINATION of things material, to things immaterial; of things vi&s;ible to things invi&s;i|ble are de&s;igned to prepare the mind to be|hold the wi&s;dom of GOD, in marking out, and the per&s;everence of men in going through with the &s;ubordinate labor of the MASON|IC BUILDING, thus far</P>
<P>To a mind, acknowledging GOD in all
<PB N="8" REF="035127_0006_1000ADA70C9DCC20">parts of Creation's Temple, it is no more dif|ficult to di&s;cern that the order of FREE and ACCEPTED MASONS, holds a place in conformity to the general plan, than that the economy of Mo&s;es maintained a &s;ubordinate relation to good things, then to come. All the difficulty of &s;uch application will ari&s;e from the limitation of Providence. The Chri&s;tian, too confined, in his views, is but too ready to exclude from the parental re|gard, all things which fall not within the com|pa&s;s of Chri&s;tian revelation. He forgets that a mode of revelation is maintained, through all Creation's works by figures, and by &s;ub|&s;tances; by relations and corre&s;pondencies, &s;o that though to Adam and Eve only, the revelation, primarily be made, the corre&s;pond|ency, of the &s;everal parts, will bring all their po&s;terity within the limits of the original and all-wi&s;e de&s;ign.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue the trackle&s;s path; to explore the deep things of GOD, in the beautious and maje&s;tic varieties, in which the proportions of beneficence are mea&s;ured out, on the one part, and with &s;olemn and awful &s;tep to follow the diver&s;ified cour&s;es of nightly &s;hade, through the borders of I&s;hmael; calls for &s;trength of mind, and per&s;everance in labor, of which the able&s;t of the philo&s;ophic chri&s;tian, or Ma&s;on|ic fraternity might be happy to boa&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT the tabernacle of Mo&s;es was to the Temple of Solomon: and what the Temple of Solomon was to the Go&s;pel Edifice; the &s;ame is the MASONIC TEMPLE to the uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="9" REF="035127_0007_1000C02E767F37B8">building of GOD. The former fell, more immediately, within the limits of re|vealed religion; the latter illu&s;trates the my&s;|teries of GOD in a vi&s;ible figure; inviting chri&s;tianity to come and reconcile her taber|nacle, and her book, and her whole &s;ervice, thro' the blood of the cro&s;s. This ma&s;onry de|clares, in the &s;ummit of her order, whil&s;t &s;he extends the my&s;terious figure of the cro&s;s, and &s;hews her &s;eal upon the Miditerranean pa&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL the diver&s;ified edifices of natural, and of revealed religion, in the&s;e united orders are founded upon one and the &s;ame plan, and tend to one and the &s;ame end. I &s;peak of chri&s;tians and of ma&s;ons who under&s;tand, and in faith|fulne&s;s, perform the duties of their order.&mdash;Under this character, the &s;ubordinate build|ings in both relations are like the diver&s;ified &s;ynagogues of Pale&s;tine; all built upon the plan of the Temple of GOD, at Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;The Supreme Architect, through who&s;e apart|ments, natural religion teacheth us to walk, is the &s;ame that walks amid&s;t the Golden Cand|le&s;ticks of the chri&s;tian and ma&s;onic building. And when the naturali&s;t &s;hall be called to behold, and made to under&s;tand the corre&s;|pondecy between the&s;e two buildings, who&s;e wor&s;hippers have not heretofore acknowledged each other, he &s;hall be made to own the hand of GOD, as well to be &s;een in our temple as in his own; and falling down, &s;hall own of a truth that the GOD, whom he hath, ignorantly wor&s;hipped, the &s;ame declare we unto him.&mdash;He &s;hall borrow a lamp from our Golden Can|dle&s;tick, with which to enlighten his own &s;oul.
<PB N="10" REF="035127_0008_1000C03151706E88">to enlighten his faternity, and to illuminate the whole building of GOD.</P>
<P>LET our &s;ubject, in your name, even now reach him this lamp! Let it tell him, that whil&s;t he rai&s;es his tube; and the philo&s;ophic eye glances at the &s;un, and &s;ays; "&s;ee yon|der the PROUD LUMINARY, from who&s;e di|vine effulgence all creation receives its life;" the eloquence of revelation, gently whi&s;pers, true is the &s;tory which phylo&s;ophy teaches, but &s;ee&s;t thou not, by the aid of the gla&s;s, the &s;pots in the face of yonder Sun?&mdash;What can this expre&s;s but the imperfection of the creature, in compari&s;on with GOD the creator. "The LORD GOD is a Sun!&mdash;in him there is Light, and in him there is no darkne&s;s at all!" Suf|fer me to &s;prinkle thy optics with the pearly drops of Cele&s;tial dew; and thou &s;halt behold every object to &s;hine, with &s;evenfold lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>LOOK at the Moon! She borrows her rays from the fountain of lights, the Sun: thus &s;hines our IMMANUEL in the mediatorial fir|manent. He &s;heds his milder rays upon the benighted family of mankind; and &s;till main|tains a benign dominion whil&s;t the Fathers glory is withdrawn.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, the Stars! a&s;&s;i&s;ting reflections, aiding to di&s;play in their &s;parkling lu&s;tre, the milder influences of redeeming love! To whom are the&s;e &s;ubordinate Luminaries in|debted, but to him that "walketh in the mid&s;t of the Golden Candle&s;ticks, and who holdeth the &s;tars in his right hand!"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035127_0009_1000C03379CC7688">
LOOK at yonder blaizing &s;tar, or firey meteor; heated by its late approach to the FOUNTAIN of LIGHT, now &s;tretches its way acro&s;s the firmament, as though de&s;ign|ing to enliven the frozen regions of the North! What is this but a vi&s;ible, though &s;ub|ordinate illu&s;tration of tho&s;e mini&s;ters of GOD, who like John the bapti&s;t, and other burning and &s;hining lights, labor to &s;trike "fre&s;h fire into the frozen hearts of the obdurate; or like the ANGEL that "flies through the Heavens, having the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to preach," commands the &s;ons of men, at the down-fall of my&s;tical Babylon, "to fear GOD, and to give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come!"</P>
<P>THE air we breathe, is the &s;piritual breath of the living &s;oul; the clouds which intercept our &s;ight; the clouds of darkne&s;s which fre|quently, pa&s;s over, and render ob&s;cure the vi|&s;ion of the phylo&s;ophic, or &s;piritual mind!&mdash;and and the diver&s;ity and impetuo&s;ity of the winds, the in&s;crutible operations of GOD, both the natural, intellectual, and moral world!</P>
<P>THE genial a&s;pect of a delightful day, ex|pre&s;s the benignity of GOD; and the de|lights of the &s;oul walking in the lights of his reconciled countenance. "In thy name &s;hall they rejoice all the day long, and in thy right. cou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall they be exalted!</P>

<P>THIS point granted; the brethren of the ancient and honorable &s;ociety of Free and Ac|cepted Ma&s;ons will not think it derogating from the rank due to their order, if it be &s;aid, that what Melchezideck of old, that king of Salem was, in relation to our go&s;pel Melchez|ideck; the &s;ame is the Temple of Solomon, in relation to the Temple in which a greater than Solomon remains to be &s;ealed. And if Abraham, returning from the &s;laughter of the kings, paid tythes to this man, and received ble&s;&s;ings from him; will you be backward to lay the implements of your labor at the thre&s;hold of the Heavenly Melchezidick, that you may receive the ble&s;&s;ings of his hand?&mdash;If the tabernacle of Mo&s;es was ta|ken down, that the Temple of Solomon might be &s;et up; and eventually, the Temple of Solomon removed to give place to the in|tellectual, yet imperfect edifice of the pre&s;ent go&s;pel building, may it not be expected, that the unfini&s;hed building, in which, now, you labor, may be removed, perhaps perfected in the light of the more perfect edifice of the latter day? If &s;o, as of the temple of the believing &s;oul, &s;o may not ye &s;ay? "we know that if the earthly hou&s;e of our tabernacle be
<PB N="13" REF="035127_0011_1000C038D0353350">di&s;&s;olved, we have a building with GOD; an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens!" The &s;ucceeding temple will di&s;play the GOLDEN AGE of ancient fable: the "new Heavens and the new Earth" of the Revelations of St. John: and the CE|LESTIAL LODGE which your craft hath long been laboring to find!</P>
<P>SUCH confidence is placed in your wi&s;|dom, that it is pre&s;umed little more need be &s;aid, to obtain your confidence, than to ex|pre&s;s the evidence which the fla&s;hings of light are capable to afford.</P>
<P>LET it, then, be under&s;tood that whil&s;t in the divine mind, the plan of the Great Ar|chitect exi&s;ted, and was continually opening it&s;elf; from the beginning, to the experience of an a&s;toin&s;hed world, it was GOD's good plea&s;ure to illu&s;trate this de&s;ign, and to exem|plify this work, in the vi&s;ible and perpetual modification, which, at your hands he hath ordained to be pre&s;erved. Your order hath been, and &s;till exi&s;ts, as a living hi&s;tory of the invi&s;ible agency of GOD, in mortal things.&mdash;You have been long laboring; but have nev|er, as yet, arrived at perfection in your arts; nor have you been able to fini&s;h the building who&s;e foundation was laid nearly &s;ix thou&s;and years ago!&mdash;nor will the building ever be fini&s;hed, or the key-&s;tone placed, until you &s;ee that in its pre&s;ent &s;tage, the building on which you labor is an imperfect thing; and can have its con&s;ummation, only, in the advancing grade of the mighty de&s;ign.

<P>To illu&s;trate this doctrine, as far as the ob|ligations of my&s;tery will admit; be it known, that on board of your &s;hip are fragments of the antideluvian, of the patriarchal, of the Mo&s;aic, and the chri&s;tian world. All the&s;e you have to empty forth, at the door of the all-perfect economy of the milennial e&s;tate. The truth of this po&s;ition, as matter of fact is &s;een, whil&s;t, in the order of your edifice, you glance at the BOW, who&s;e pillars re&s;t in fly|ing clouds; denoting the transfer of the cov|enant to ages, then unborn; or the extention of its influence far as the clouds do fly! Con|firmed by an appeal to the altar of &s;acrifice of Noah, de&s;cending, with his charge from the ark&mdash;to the rod of Mo&s;es upon the Egypt|ian ho&s;t&mdash;and to the re&s;urrection of him of whom Mo&s;es and the prophets did write; and finally to the &s;tation of him who blows the JUBILEE TRUMP: that the &s;criptures may be fulfilled, at the con&s;ummation of your or|der &s;aying, throughout the prophetic Heav|ens, "now is come &s;alvation and glory and honor, and the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his CHRIST.</P>

See a demon&s;tration of this in the mixed character of your brotherhood. At the thre&s;hold of nature's God &s;ome bow; whil&s;t, at the door of the chri&s;tian altar, alone, another will pay his homage!</P>

<P>Do you teach that the path to the KEY, which keepeth knowledge is progre&s;&s;ive; that the learner is to advance, &s;tep by &s;tep; and is this to &s;often the too a&s;piring mind; or to &s;pur to diligence the &s;lotful! how excellent the rule when applied to the purpo&s;e of regu|lating the cour&s;e of tho&s;e, who are pre&s;&s;ing for "the mark of the prize of the high call|ing of GOD which is CHRIST JESUS!"</P>

<P>THUS is he to be proclaimed, as well GOD of the material and vi&s;ible, as of the intel|lectual and &s;piritual building. Of your labor, and of ours, in connection with all that phi|lo&s;ophy, in its ab&s;tract tenets, can teach, it may be &s;aid as in the text, "for every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man, but he that built all things is GOD.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall be &s;aid of the Mo&s;aic pave|ment! Can brethren walk here, and not &s;tumble? Yes my brethren!&mdash;this is the true ground on which we mu&s;t all proceed, the ground, on which we may, in &s;afety, travel together: Safe as on the pavement which GOD'S own right hand hath laid, and which his perpetual decree &s;upports!

<P>IS there hope in death?&mdash;Behold the &s;pade u&s;ed, indeed, for the purpo&s;e of planting our bodies in the du&s;t, and &s;o it is, to promote the objects of vegitation in the garden of nature.

<P>IN this place it might not be improper to relieve your patience, were it not that more fully, to confirm the chri&s;tian doctrine, from a view of its corre&s;pondency with ma&s;onic emblems, and the more powerfully to illu&s;|trate the analogy of the works of GOD in general; and thereby to gain increa&s;ing rev|erence to his holy name; a little indulgence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> craved, that the corre&s;pondence between the ma&s;onic and the chri&s;tian temple may be a little farther maintained. This corre&s;pond|ence is demon&s;trable:</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the antiquity of the ma&s;onic ori|gin. It claims to be as old as creation.&mdash;I doubt it not! it has with it the great lights, which GOD, at fir&s;t created: and the Redeem|er, him&s;elf, in point of antiquity, &s;ays, before Abraham was, I AM!</P>
<P N="2">2. The foundation of this edifice was laid, with much labor and toil. A con&s;piracy again&s;t its founder exi&s;ted, and he fell a prey to the fury of the con&s;pirators!&mdash;What labor did the LORD of Life, undergo; what diffi|culties overcome, and what a cruel death &s;u&s;|tain; that the foundation of our hope might be laid in the &s;hedding of his own blood!</P>
<P>IN this con&s;piracy, how evident the analo|gy, between the Lucifer who con&s;pired again&s;t the throne of GOD! the Devil who
<PB N="26" REF="035127_0024_1000C050D992DC18">tempted our fir&s;t parents, and marred the beauteous order of our moral frame! the Judas, who betrayed his ma&s;ter, and the con|&s;pirators who died without mercy, and were buried in the ruins of that temple; again&s;t who&s;e founder they had con&s;pired!&mdash;Thus let thine enemies peri&s;h, O LORD!&mdash;Let the thunder-bolts which drave Lucifer from Hea|ven, follow his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in traitorous oppo|&s;ition to the ble&s;&s;ed will of GOD, until Heav|en and Earth &s;hall be cleared of them that defy his holy name! may death receive them and Hell &s;wallow them up quick!</P>
<P N="3">3. HATH this order of builders been &s;up|ported; handed down, and to this day, are its my&s;teries pre&s;erved in the hands of men of renown&mdash;have kings, emperors, &s;tate&s;men, and hi&s;torians enrolled their names in the an|nals of this record, &s;o hath the chri&s;tian doctrine received &s;upport from the efforts of genius, of literature, and of the Holy Spirit of GOD, moving upon the pavement of our go&s;pel building!</P>
<P N="4">4. HATH this order, avowedly, pre&s;erved certain &s;ecrets, peculiar to the brotherhood: &s;o in the go&s;pel building, "the &s;ecret of the LORD is with them that fear him, and he will &s;hew them his covenant." Into the my&s;teries of the mo&s;t holy place none can look, but tho&s;e who approach by the blood of JESUS.</P>
<P N="5">5. ARE the duties of fellow&s;hip, of frater|nity, and of univer&s;al benevolence in&s;i&s;ted on by the rules of this &s;ociety: how corre&s;pond|ent
<PB N="27" REF="035127_0025_1000C05326857EF8">to the duties inculcated, by the principles of our holy religion!</P>
<P N="6">6.

May the incen&s;e of prai&s;e, even a pure offering &s;hortly ari&s;e, from the altar of every nation, that "the knowledge of the LORD might fill the whole earth, even as the waters cover the &s;ea!"</P>
<P N="7">7. DOTH this fraternity acknowledge im|perfection in the knowledge of its my&s;teries, and in the conduct of its members; with how great ju&s;tice, may the chri&s;tian fold make humble confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame!</P>

<P>LET, however, a few &s;hafts of repellant truth &s;mite with contempt, a certain combi|nation of men to render contemptible that which they under&s;tand not, and to overturn that which they never helped to build!</P>
<P>FIRST; of tho&s;e who would &s;ay, there are no valuable facts, no hidden my&s;teries, in the
<PB N="28" REF="035127_0026_1000ADC029B3D3B8">chambers of the ma&s;onic building worthy of knowledge or of general attention!</P>
<P>LET &s;uch take rank, with tho&s;e who igno|rantly belch forth, that there is no truth in the bible, nor reality in the my&s;teries of vital re|ligion! &mdash;Do the fraternity hold &s;uch belchings in &s;overeign contempt; &s;o do we!</P>
<P>ARE there any who &s;ay that the ma&s;onic temple is a nur&s;ery of infidelity, and of irre|ligion! How can it be?&mdash;As well might Mo&s;es when he &s;aw the burning bu&s;h; or the fla&s;hes of Sinai's mount, or the glory which over&s;hadowed the temple have been accounted expo&s;ed to infidel principles, or to an irreli|gious practice!&mdash;When all the &s;ymbols of the divine pre&s;ence, and admini&s;tration are look|ing a man full in the face, how can he be chargeable with being a learner or promoter of irreligion!&mdash;let &s;uch an one be bid, GOD &s;peed; with his ignorance and pre&s;umption!</P>
<P>ARE there any, who &s;ay, that the ma&s;onic lodges are work-&s;hops, in which are forged &s;hafts, favorable to the principles of the Illu|minati? &mdash;of &s;uch it may be demanded, "what are the principles of the Illuminati?"
