<OPENER><SALUTE>CHRISTIAN READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is well for us that our &s;overeign Father has founded Zion, and laid an elect, tri|ed, precious, &s;ure, and everla&s;ting, foundation there; and has brought, and daily brings, the poor (the &s;piritually poor) of his people, with re&s;ignation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his &s;overeign will, to tru&s;t in it: while tho&s;e who wage impious war with God's di&s;criminating grace, and rebel and kick at the immoveable foundation that he has laid, are led by &s;atan into an empty profe&s;|&s;ion, in order to &s;py out our liberty, and bring us, if po&s;&s;ible, into bondage. The&s;e compa&s;s Zion's walls, count her towers, ob&s;erve her pal|aces, and mark her bulwarks, only in order to attack her invincible fortre&s;&s;es with the feeble force of carnal logic: and, after all the a&s;&s;aults that have been made, not one &s;trong hold is brought to ruin, nor ever will be; for <HI>God is in the mid&s;t of her, &s;he &s;hall not be moved.</HI> P&s;. xlvi. 5. <HI>The Highe&s;t him&s;elf &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h her.</HI> P&s;. lxxxvii. 5. Hence it is that not one of her cords have ever been loo&s;ed yet, nor &s;hall one &s;take ever be moved. To the &s;overeignty of this glorious founder, and this elect foundation, the legal workmonger, the wi&s;e above what is
<PB N="iv" REF="030610_0003_0FE8307DCAEA4BD8">written, the lofty with his terrible looks, the con&s;equential child of the fle&s;h, the &s;elf-depend|ent and &s;elf-&s;ufficient Arminian, cannot &s;ubmit, and therefore are driven to the utmo&s;t extrem|ity. They have hung on the conditional pro|mi&s;es of the old covenant, and on their own perver&s;ions of the holy &s;criptures, till they have been beaten out of all the&s;e refuges by the force of &s;ound argument; and &s;ome of them have been driven out of the curious web of <HI>fle&s;hly perfection,</HI> and obliged to e&s;cape, both wounded and naked, by the devil him&s;elf, who has led them by &s;in into public contempt and &s;candal. They are driven out of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s al&s;o by the cur&s;e of the law and the fla&s;hes of revea|led wrath, and they begin now to be driven out of all confidence in the fle&s;h by the mena|ces, rebukes, &s;olemn appeals, and la&s;hes, of hon|e&s;t con&s;cience; &s;o that they are driven to their wit's end, and begin to relinqui&s;h all preten&s;ions to any union with the a&s;&s;emblies of mount Zi|on. The ca&s;e of the&s;e hypocrites is more de&s;|perate than that of the phari&s;ee, who re&s;ts &s;e|cure in the law; more perilous than that of the fool, who tru&s;ts in his own heart; wor&s;e than the palace of the &s;trong man armed, which is kept in peace; more terrible than that of the dog, for whom there is hope while joined to all the living; more dangerous than that of Joab at the horns of the altar; and more deplorable than that of tho&s;e who pray to the rocks and mountains; for the&s;e tacitly own, even in pub|lic print, that they have no hope <HI>but in the con|gregation of the dead,</HI> nor any gue&s;ts <HI>but in the depths of hell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="030610_0004_0FE8308508197898">
I &s;ay they tacitly acknowledge this, for it is <HI>out of the abundance of the heart</HI> (Chri&s;t tells us) <HI>that the mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> Now if Mr. Winche&s;|ter's faith and hope do not center in this re&s;tor|ation from hell, he preaches what he does not believe; which is acting the part of the wor&s;t of hypocrites; and, if he does believe and ex|pect to be damned him&s;elf as well as his confed|erates, he then fulfils the &s;cripture, by believ|ing that him&s;elf and his followers <HI>&s;hall both fall into the ditch;</HI> and this e&s;tabli&s;hes his reputa|tion as <HI>a blind guide.</HI> And certain it is that they mu&s;t be much in the dark, and far enough from <HI>perfect day,</HI> or they would never grope for an anchorage in a bottomle&s;s pit, or for hope of light in utter darkne&s;s. But &s;o it is; they are come at la&s;t to <HI>the land of forgetfulne&s;s,</HI> and to <HI>the generation that &s;hall never &s;ee light;</HI> they are come to <HI>the Gog and Magog army,</HI> to <HI>death the king of terrors,</HI> to <HI>an innumerable company of devils,</HI> to <HI>Lucifer &s;on of the morning,</HI> and to <HI>&s;atan the king of all the&s;e.</HI> This is dealing with fa|miliar &s;pirits indeed; this is peeping and mut|tering with a witne&s;s. But <HI>&s;hould not a people &s;eek unto their God?</HI> Should they &s;eek (in&s;tead of the living) unto the dead? I&s;a. viii. 19; a community without God, without Chri&s;t, and without one friend in heaven: and the&s;e are to bribe ju&s;tice by &s;uffering in hell fire! But <HI>the congregation of hypocrites &s;hall be de&s;olate, and fire &s;hall con&s;ume the tabernacles of bribery.</HI> Job xv. 34. And de&s;olate they mu&s;t be, or they never would &s;crape acquaintance, claim kindred, or cultivate friend&s;hip and fellow&s;hip, with &s;uch a company as this. <HI>O, my &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret! unto their a&s;&s;embly, mine hon|our,
<PB N="vi" REF="030610_0005_0FE830868EA4B7E0">be not thou united!</HI> Gen. xlix. 6. <HI>I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils; ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye canot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 20, 21. We may now &s;ound the trumpet, and cry, <HI>To your tents, O I&s;rael!</HI> for <HI>the &s;word of the Lord and of Gideon,</HI> truth and con&s;cience, have driven the&s;e Hebrews into their holes.</P>
<P>When Mr. Winche&s;ter writes another <HI>dia|logue,</HI> he &s;hall not need to dre&s;s up an automa|ton figure to cuff about in his book, for he &s;hall not want an antagoni&s;t as long as God &s;pares my life and the u&s;e of my limbs; for I know that there is not one text in the Bible that holds forth, or promi&s;es, directly or indirectly, &s;alva|tion from hell torments, either for men or devils; if there be, let him produce it. He has not pro|duced one yet. But he calls for "the &s;pirit of Mo&s;es and of Chri&s;t, of meekne&s;s and love, to canva&s;s the &s;ubject." The meekne&s;s and love of Mo&s;es were of God; they were graces from him, which Mr. Winche&s;ter never had, nor can he de&s;cribe either. The meekne&s;s of Mo&s;es was exerci&s;ed in the cau&s;e of truth, not fal&s;e|hood; and towards the children of I&s;rael, not towards the Amalekites, nor devils. Mo&s;es is a &s;worn enemy to &s;atan and all his friends.&mdash;<HI>And they &s;hall no more offer their &s;acrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring: this shall be a &s;tatute for ever to them throughout their generations.</HI> Levit. xvii. 7. If the going out of the affections after &s;atan in idols be term|ed <HI>whoring,</HI> and is forbidden by an eternal &s;tat|ute, what &s;hall we &s;ay of Mr. Winche&s;ter, who
<PB N="vii" REF="030610_0006_0FE8308B206219A0">has entered into a &s;olemn league and covenant with them, and has bound him&s;elf up in the gall of bitterne&s;s and bond of iniquity with devils? Nor does the love of God, as de&s;cribed by Mo|&s;es, extend it&s;elf to all <HI>intelligences,</HI> like that of Mr. Winche&s;ter; not to devils, nor yet to the wicked who are dead, nor to all mankind liv|ing. <HI>Yea, he loved the people; all his &s;aints are in thy hand, and they &s;at down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.</HI> Deut. xxxiii. 3. This is God's eternal love of choice, of appro|bation, and delight. This is entailed on his &s;aints, &s;anctified and &s;et apart in his eternal pur|po&s;e. The&s;e are in his hand, pre&s;erved in Chri&s;t and called, and out of who&s;e hands none can pluck them. The&s;e are not wi&s;e above what is written, nor proud, doating about que&s;|tions when they know nothing; but are hum|bled to &s;ubmit to divine revelation, and to &s;it at the Lord's feet to learn.&mdash;They do not fly to Plato, Pythagoras, Socrates, Virgil, and the &s;on of perdition, to know the things of eternity.&mdash;Every one of the&s;e &s;it at the Saviour's feet, and receive his words. This is the everla&s;ting love of God to his &s;aints, as de&s;cribed by Mo&s;es; this is all free, and of grace. But the love of God to his other creatures is only &s;een in prov|idence. <HI>God loveth the &s;tranger in giving him food and raiment,</HI> (Deut. x. 18) and no further. What right has Mr. Winche&s;ter to call for the meekne&s;s and love of Mo&s;es, who is a &s;tranger to the love of grace, is in the bed of loves with devils, and who &s;tretches the love of God to a re&s;toration of all fallen intelligences, when God him&s;elf has revealed or extended it no further to &s;trangers than giving them food and raiment?
<PB N="viii" REF="030610_0007_0FE8308E694984E0">And what right has he to expect or call for the love and meekne&s;s of Chri&s;t? Did Chri&s;t in his day exerci&s;e meekne&s;s to &s;uch enemies to him as Mr. Winche&s;ter? Did he doat or fawn over the blind guides, the painted &s;epulchres, the graves that appeared not, and the &s;cullions who made clean the out&s;ide of the cup and platter? Did he call them Philanthropi&s;ts, men of can|dour, friends to mankind, men of love, of can|did judgments, and liberal &s;entiments? Did he not call them wolves, devourers of widows' hou&s;es, thieves, and robbers; children of hell, vipers, &s;erpents, adulterers; and palm both them and their works upon the devil him&s;elf, and promi&s;e them the greater damnation? And did he &s;how, or exerci&s;e, or entail, any love up|on the&s;e? Did he not tell them that he came into the world for judgment to them, that they that &s;aw might be made blind? And he will come for judgment to them the &s;econd time, when he will require from that generation all the righteous blood &s;hed from the blood of Abel.</P>
<P>Reader, I have not in this work gone through what he has written upon this &s;ubject, in can|va&s;&s;ing and &s;ifting his perver&s;ions and damna|ble &s;ophi&s;try. This, I find is already done by a Mr. MASON, who&s;e book, I believe, is ju&s;t out. It is ea&s;y for a man to &s;it down and quote from &s;cripture a thou&s;and texts, and &s;ay all the&s;e favour a notion; but it is another thing to bring one plain text, which, in its lit|eral, grammatical, and received &s;en&s;e, proves it. Mr. Winche&s;ter has adopted the former method, in order to deter men from an&s;wering him. For to rein&s;tate &s;uch a multitude of
<PB N="ix" REF="030610_0008_0FE83094B87CEC18">texts in their own proper light, and to refute all his carnal arguments drawn from them, would fill a quarto volume, to an&s;wer a two|penny &s;quib. Mr. Winche&s;ter was aware of this; and he may thank Satan for his council. What he has aimed to prove is, <HI>the univer&s;al re&s;|toration of devils, and all &s;inners, from hell to heaven;</HI> and my aim is, <HI>to prove him a liar, and his &s;peech nothing worth.</HI> Job xxiv. 25.&mdash;And upon &s;cripture ground I am w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ling to meet him; and, by the help of God, to di&s;pute the point as long as he plea&s;es; for God does not allow him one text in the Bible to &s;upport his doctrine. He may choo&s;e which text he plea&s;es; I have no doubt but the Lord will en|able me, or &s;ome other of his &s;ervants, to re|cover every text that has fallen among the&s;e thieves.</P>
<P>Reader, beware, le&s;t, being led away by the er|ror of the wicked, you fall from your own &s;tead|fa&s;tne&s;s. This awful doctrine is calculated to bol&s;ter up the awakened &s;inner, to embolden the hypocrite, and to encourage the pre&s;umptu|ous, by promi&s;ing life and glory to tho&s;e who work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s. The Lord deliver us from this, and every other, path of the de&s;troyer, for the &s;ake of his dear Son. Amen and amen.</P>

</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t, Treat of a <HI>good Hope.</HI> The word <HI>Hope</HI> is in common u&s;e among mo&s;t men, and is often u&s;ed in connection with &s;alvation: "As I hope to be &s;aved" is a common expre&s;&s;ion, and is often u&s;ed to confirm a word, or clear a per&s;on &s;u&s;pec|ted of fal&s;ehood; and generally u&s;ed by tho&s;e who are igno|rant of &s;alvation, and de&s;titute of all hope in it. There is a <HI>hope,</HI> &s;o called, that is from &s;elf, not from God: as that of a phari&s;ee, which &s;prings from a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition of his be|ing more holy than other men; which hope is encouraged by an ob&s;ervation of the conduct of the mo&s;t openly profane, and comparing him&s;elf with them, and looking at his own duties through the fal&s;e mirror of the other's exce&s;s of ri|ot; but then this hope anchors in &s;elf, not within the vail; it is founded on legal duties or dead works, not on Chri&s;t's merit; it centers in a killing commandment, not in a life-giving promi&s;e; it ri&s;es from deception in the heart, not from a work of grace; it is the hope of the &s;elf-righteous,
<PB N="12" REF="030610_0010_0FE8309C96CF7658">not of the ju&s;tified &s;oul; it is the hope of the hypocrite, not of the &s;aint, and therefore it mu&s;t peri&s;h with the &s;inner. <HI>The hope of unju&s;t men peri&s;heth, you the hypocrite's hope &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t, who be&s;t knows the &s;tate of all mankind, has declared that men in a &s;tate of nature are <HI>without God, and having no hope in the world.</HI> And every &s;inner who is taught of God will &s;et to his &s;eal that this is true; for, when the killing commandment enters and awakens the &s;inner's benumbed con&s;cience, when revealed wrath and accumulated guilt meet together in the &s;inner's &s;oul, <HI>his fal&s;e hope</HI> is like <HI>a &s;pider's w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b;</HI> it is no anchor of the &s;oul; it is neither &s;ure nor &s;tedfa&s;t; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gives way as &s;oon as the &s;torm begins, and down the &s;inne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> goes into the horrible pit and into the miry clay, into all real and imaginary torment; and down he would go into de&s;pendency, de&s;pair, di&s;traction, and perdition too, unle&s;s upheld by almighty power: for the entrance of reveal|ed wrath makes terrible work with a fal&s;e hope. All re&s;ting in legal performances, all fal&s;e props, and expectations of heaven on the footing of human merit, founded on &s;elf-confidence, die, and &s;hall never live again. And &s;uch is the end of the wicked in death. <HI>But the eyes of the wicked &s;hall fail, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape; and their hope &s;hall be as the giving up of the gho&s;t.</HI> Job ii. 20.</P>
<P>A &s;inner in this &s;tate finds him&s;elf without hope, and with|out help; and it is not in his power either to hope in, or expect any thing from God, without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Hope</HI> is one of the &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; it is a free grace gift, and comes to us by the Spirit of promi&s;e, and is wrought in us. It is a rich grant of a gracious God, which leads the &s;oul to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, from who&s;e fullne&s;s it comes, and in whom as in its proper object, it centers. It is an anchor within the vail; and, as it is a free grace gift, and has an Almighty Saviour for its object, it is called, in oppo&s;ition to all fal&s;e hopes, and to all hopes founded in &s;elf and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>a good hope through grace.</HI> 2 The&s;. ii. 16.</P>
<P>Sinners, who are convinced of their &s;ins by the Spirit, know, by experience, that a hope in God is not the produce of na|ture. Nor can the awakened &s;inner either obtain it by his own power, or even exerci&s;e the lea&s;t hope in God until the Spirit enables him. It is not with him, whether he <HI>will</HI> hope and tru&s;t in the Lord, but the great que&s;tion is, whether he <HI>may.</HI> He can &s;ee no foundation to hope on till God di&s;|covers
<PB N="13" REF="030610_0011_0FE8309E1E655B58">it, nor any object to hope in till manife&s;ted to him; nor feel the lea&s;t hope or expectation in him&s;elf, nor ever would, unle&s;s produced in him by a divine agent. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is &s;en&s;ible of, for the burden of im and &s;en&s;e of wrath &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> him; and he would deba&s;e him&s;elf to a level with the brute creation, and &s;it in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes, could he obtain but the lea&s;t degree of hope in a dear Redeemer. <HI>He &s;itteth alone and keepeth &s;ilence, becau&s;e he hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rne it upon him. He p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tteth his mouth in the de&s;t, if &s;o be there may be hope.</HI> Lam. iii. 28, 29.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> is not employed about things is us, but about things <HI>before</HI> us; not about things <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> but things <HI>future;</HI> not a|bout what we <HI>have,</HI> but what we <HI>want.</HI> For, if I am in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a thing, there is no room for hope or expectation about it; for how can I hope for what I have got? or expect what is already my own? The &s;elf-lo&s;t and &s;elf-de&s;pairing &s;inner, that is favored with the lea&s;t degree of hope, hopes for the manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t to his &s;oul; but, when Chri&s;t is revealed to him, then he is the hope of glory in him. The guilty &s;inner hopes for pardon, or the knowledge of &s;alvation by the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, through Chri&s;t; and, if God gives him an expectation of it, he &s;hall &s;urely have it, even though he &s;ees it not accompli&s;hed. <HI>For we are &s;aved by hope; but hope that is &s;een is not hope; for what a man &s;eeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we &s;ee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</HI> Rom. viii. 24, 25.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> is a grace be&s;towed upon a helple&s;s, &s;elf-de&s;pairing, mi&s;erable &s;inner; and performs wonders in de&s;perate ca&s;es. On which account it is called a <HI>helmet,</HI> which is an iron cap to &s;creen the head in the day of battle; and an <HI>anchor,</HI> which is the mariner's chief dependance in a &s;torm, and when in want of &s;ea room. Hope, therefore, is employed about things hard and difficult, and yet po&s;&s;ible. For in|&s;tance, God &s;orely threatened the children of I&s;rael, who had married heathen wives. The children of God had married the daughters of Satan. <HI>Judah hath dealt treacherou&s;|ly, and an abomination is committed in I&s;rael, and in Jeru&s;alem; for Judah hath profaned the holine&s;s of the Lord, which he ought to love, and hath married the daughter of a &s;trange God. The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the ma&s;ter and the &s;cholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob.</HI> Mal. ii. 11, 12. The hope of a &s;in|ner, involved, in this profanity, and again&s;t whom the word of God is &s;o explicit and pointed, mu&s;t have hard and diffi|cult work; and yet, even in this de&s;perate ca&s;e, through Je|&s;us
<PB N="14" REF="030610_0012_0FE830A2AF242550">Chri&s;t and his great atonement, &s;alvation is po&s;&s;ible, or el&s;e there could be no ground for hope; and there was a po&s;|&s;ible ground for hope in this ca&s;e. <HI>And Shechaniah the &s;on of Jehiel, of the &s;ons of Elam, an&s;wered and &s;aid unto Ezra, We have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t our God and have taken &s;trange wives of the people of the land, yet now there is hope in I&s;rael concerning this thing.</HI> Ezra i. 2.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> is an internal hanging of the mind upon a di&s;tant ob|ject, attended with expectation of help from the object on which the mind hangs. But then there mu&s;t be &s;ome way opened for the troubled mind, with her expectations, to enter in at. The broken law reveals God in terrible maje&s;ty: darkne&s;s is his &s;ecret pavilion, and dreadful wrath is reveal|ed. The cur&s;e of the law, the &s;word of ju&s;tice, are point blank again&s;t the &s;inner; and he &s;ees it, and feels it: and, as the &s;inner knows that he is guilty before God, and under the cur&s;e, law and con&s;cience both condemn him, and he can|not plead innocent. Sins bar him from God; and terrible ma|je&s;ty forbids his approach, keeps him at a di&s;tance, yea, makes the &s;oul fly from before him; but he knows not whether to go from his &s;pirit, nor where to fly from his terrible pre&s;|ence. The awakened &s;inner &s;ees no way of acce&s;s to an angry God in a broken law; nor can he hope or expect that God will change his mind, repeal his law, or prove fal&s;e to his word, in order to gratify him who is an enemy to him. There is no acce&s;s without a mediator, no pardon without atonement, no cancelling infinite debts without a &s;urety, no gaol delivery without &s;atisfaction, nor ju&s;tification without perfect obedience.&mdash;And Je&s;us Chri&s;t is all the&s;e: but while he is hid there is no opening appears, no pa&s;&s;age through which hope and expectation can po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;s to God; but in <HI>the valley of Achor he opens a door of hope.</HI> Ho&s;. ii. 15.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is the only door; and he that rejects him, and who&s;e hope enters not in by this door, has &s;omething vile and dam|nable even in his very hope. He hopes that God will not deal with him according to his &s;ins, nor according to his ab&s;olute threatenings; he hopes that God will change his mind, be perjured in his oath, and lie to his word; which is making God ju&s;t &s;uch an one as him&s;elf; but God is true, and every man a liar. <HI>He is not man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent.</HI> Set a&s;ide the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and there is neither refuge nor anchorage for a poor &s;inner.

<P>The word of God confines all hope entirely to this world, and to men in this pre&s;ent &s;tate.

<P>The fir&s;t thing that the awakened &s;inner hopes for (as be|fore ob&s;erved) is the revelation of Chri&s;t to his &s;oul, and par|don and peace through him. The de&s;ire of all nations is to him the one thing needful; and he knows that, if he gets it

<P>But, when Chri&s;t manife&s;ts him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;inner, when he &s;hines into his heart, and pre&s;ents him&s;elf to his faith; when he removes the heavy burden of his &s;ins, and cha&s;es them from his &s;ight; when he purges his con&s;cience, binds up the broken heart, &s;peaks peace to the &s;oul, &s;ilences all its ac|cu&s;ers, ca&s;ts out fear and torment, &s;oftens his hard &s;pirit, and conquers his &s;tubborn will; enlarges his &s;oul with love, and re&s;cues his troubled mind from the meditations of terror, and from the gloomy regions of the &s;hadow of death; comforts him on every &s;ide, and fills him with joy and peace in believ|ing; <HI>then</HI> the de&s;ire of all nations is come, the de&s;ire is accom|pli&s;hed, and it is &s;weet to the &s;oul.

And certain it is that the truth of God in his word &s;hall never return void: it &s;hall accompli&s;h the end for which it is &s;ent, and pro&s;per in the thing that plea&s;es God: and at la&s;t in the &s;alvation and glorification of God's elect. <HI>Truth &s;hall be &s;ettled in heaven.</HI> P&s;alm cxix. 89. But then the non-elect are a &s;eed of fal&s;ehood; there is no truth in them; their right hand is a right hand of fal&s;ehood.&mdash;They are not of God; but of their father the devil, who was a liar from the beginning. They cannot deliver their &s;ouls, nor &s;ay, <HI>Is there not a lie in my right hand? And as the tree falis, &s;o it lies:</HI> it &s;hall never be turned, nor the &s;tate of it ever be al|tered: <HI>for they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P>But then it may be <HI>objected</HI>&mdash;If they that go down into the pit cannot hope for God's truth, it looks as if no branch of divine truth will ever appear there&mdash;nothing but fal&s;ehood; which is confirming Mr. Winche&s;ter's doctrine, who&s;e hope is, that God will prove a liar, and be perjured in his oath. Mu&s;t not the truth of God appear to the wicked in his unre|pealed law, in his fulfilmeat of the awful threatening, and in the execution of the righteous &s;entence according to the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in, which ends in an eternal bani&s;hment from his pre&s;ence? I <HI>an&s;wer</HI>&mdash;The truth of God will appear in all the&s;e: <HI>for as is his fear, &s;o is his wrath;</HI> both are for <HI>ever,</HI> and and both are &s;ure; the former to the &s;aint, and the latter to the &s;inner. But this branch of truth <HI>is not hoped for,</HI> but ho|ped again&s;t. Hope is always employed about &s;omething <HI>good,</HI> &s;omething <HI>de&s;irable,</HI> and &s;omething that the poor &s;inner feels his need of: hope of the right kind hopes for the mer|cy
<PB N="23" REF="030610_0021_0FE830C49EA13790">of God, and the truth of his &s;alvation. But the&s;e repro|bates are <HI>a people of no under&s;tanding, therefore he that made them will have no mercy on them, and he that created them will &s;hew them no favour;</HI> and, if no mercy is to be had on them, nor fa|vour &s;hewn to them, <HI>then they that go down into the pit cannot hope for it.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>truth</HI> we are to under&s;tand our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the <HI>truth</HI> of his divine nature; who is truly, properly, e&s;&s;en|tially, and eternally, GOD, in every &s;en&s;e of that great and tremendous name, and in all glorious perfections. <HI>He is the true God, and eternal life;</HI> and in his human nature truly and properly man; and in every covenant character faithful and true. In his prophetic office, in the doctrines he taught, and in the te&s;timony that he bore, he is the faithful and true witne&s;s; yea, he is the truth of all the ancient propheties: <HI>to him gave all the prophets witne&s;s:</HI> and he is the truth, &s;um, and &s;ub&s;tance, of every doctrine of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel.&mdash;He is the angel of the great council, and the fir&s;t elect in the ancient &s;ettlements of eternity. Prede&s;tination to the adop|tion of children, and the choice of God to eternal life, are both in him. Redemption and &s;atisfaction; ju&s;tification and reconciliation; pardon, peace, and acceptance with God; are all in him, and of him. He is the great and rich gift; and all the invaluable trea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings, that are hold forth in every unconditional promi&s;e, are what is called <HI>the un&s;earchable rickes of Chri&s;t.</HI> He is the &s;ub&s;tance of all the ceremonial &s;hadows, and the truth of all the legal types.&mdash;<HI>The law was given by Mo&s;es, but grace and truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He is the true tabernacle, which God pitched and not man. And this King, in his divine favour, is the <HI>cloud,</HI> and this Holy One is the <HI>flame,</HI> that followed I&s;rael through|out the dreary de&s;art. He is the hidden manna, and the flowing rock; the mercy &s;eat, and the ark of our &s;trength, where all the &s;ecret trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge are hid. He is the vail, and the entrance into the holy place; the golden pot, and the blooming rod; the golden table, and the bread of life; the altar, prie&s;t, and &s;acrifice. He is the laborious o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that bore the legal yoke; the red heifer, that made atonement; the fatted calf, that feods the prodi|gal; and the lamb of God, that takes away the &s;in of the world. He is the day-break, day-&s;tar, and day-&s;pring, that has vi&s;ited us, and who has made all tho&s;e &s;hadows flee a|way, and nothing but a <HI>&s;olid &s;ub&s;tance</HI> is left for us. <HI>God hav|ing

<P>He is the fulfilling end of the moral law; by whom it was magnified and made honourable; and by who&s;e obedi|ence, to us imputed, attended with the Holy Gho&s;t and love of God <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law is fulfilled</HI> IN US, (though not <HI>by</HI> us) <HI>who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the Spirit.</HI> Indeed he is the truth of the whole bible.

The de&s;truction of the antedeluvian world, and of the cities of the plain, is an awful di&s;play of his inflexible ju&s;tice, and of his holy indignation at all &s;in; while the pre&s;ervation of Noah and Lot as loudly proclaim his di&s;criminating grace and &s;overeign clemency. The journals of the patriarchs, and their po&s;terity, are all attended and be&s;trewn with his faithfulne&s;s and truth to them, both in providence and in grace. His tender care of them is clearly &s;een, and his ble&s;|&s;ing on them, the provi&s;ion he made for them, his protection of them, and his love tokens to them. <HI>He led them from one nation to another people, and &s;uffered none to do them wrong; yea, be reproved kings for their &s;akes, &s;aying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no barm.</HI></P>
<P>And, although &s;ome &s;ay, "I can &s;ee nothing of Chri&s;t in the Song of Sclomon, in the books of Ruth and E&s;ther, &amp;c." yet the book of Ruth exhibits nothing el&s;e but the grace of Chri&s;t, and the wonderful foot&s;teps of Providence; yea, the conver&s;ion of that woman, through whom, by the female line, according to the fle&s;h, Chri&s;t came, is a wonderful hint of the &s;alvation of the <HI>heathen.</HI> And, as for the book of E&s;ther, the hand of the Lord toward his &s;ervants, and his indignation toward his enemies, appear almo&s;t in every line, It was he that &s;ent them into Babylon for their idolatry; he was a little &s;anctuary to them when they came there, and was &s;een <HI>upon a red hor&s;e among the myrtle trees,</HI> when they came back again. Zech. i. 8. He &s;topped the lions' mouths in Daniel's den; walked with the three children in the fiery &s;urnace; brought his own captive daughter to the throne of the kingdom; hung Haman at his own expence; and advanced Mordecai from a decreed de&s;truction to the dignity of prime mini&s;ter. It was this Michael, the great prince, that &s;tood for the children of I&s;rael again&s;t the devil in the
<PB N="25" REF="030610_0023_0FE830CCAC3EDFB0">courts of Per&s;ia; and it was he that re&s;i&s;ted him again at the right hand of Jo&s;hua, in the land of I&s;rael: in all which he appeared their God, their Saviour, their Ring, and their Mediator. And, as for the Song of Solomon, every line of it proclaims its own author; for there is none that &s;peaketh like him; and, it being a &s;ealed book to the wile and pru|dent, &s;hews plain enough that it is &s;acred; and, were all the worldly wi&s;e upon the earth to undertake to make a book like it, there would be no more re&s;emblance between theirs and the original, than there is between the prophet I&s;aiah's predictions and the whims of old mother Shipton. That which flows from a divine &s;pring has both a fulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction in it; but that which is pre&s;&s;ed from human brains is nothing but a &s;ound from emptine&s;s, and proves a broken ci&s;tern to all that &s;eek entertainment therein. This Je&s;us is the truth of all the bible. <HI>Search the &s;criptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me.</HI> But then, &s;ays the Saviour, <HI>the world &s;ees me no more.</HI> They &s;hall &s;ee him as their judge in the great day, for then <HI>every eye &s;hall &s;ce him;</HI> and his enemies &s;hall lick the du&s;t.&mdash;But, as a Saviour, the world &s;ees me <HI>no more.</HI> The&s;e believe not on him. <HI>Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall die in your &s;ins; and whither I go ye cannot come.</HI> John viii. 21. And, if they are to &s;ee him <HI>no more,</HI> and if they <HI>cannot</HI> come where he is, then <HI>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Again, by <HI>truth</HI> we may under&s;tand the Holy Gho&s;t in all his convineing, quickening, regenerating, renewing, &s;anctify|ing, comforting, &s;ealing, and purifying, work on the &s;ouls of God's elect. <HI>The Spirit beareth witne&s;s, becau&s;e the Spirit is truth.</HI> 1 John v. 6. And &s;o are all his operations and in|&s;tructions. This ble&s;&s;ed <HI>anointing teacheth us all things, and is truth, and is no lie.</HI> 1 John ii. 27. He guides us into all truth, and bears a true te&s;timony with our own con&s;cience to our ju&s;tification and adoption; and reveals to us the true mind and will of God, and the true &s;tate of our &s;ouls before him. He &s;earches the deep things of God, and lets us know what is freely given us of God. He reveals the &s;overeign grace of God, and his good will to us; and is the life and truth of all grace in us. He purifies our heads and hearts from guilt and fal&s;chood, and from the fal&s;e notions that we en|tertained both of God and our&s;elves. He bears a true te&s;ti|mony of Je&s;us to us; <HI>he &s;hall te&s;ti&s;y of me.</HI> He receives the things of Chri&s;t, and reveals them to us; and &s;hews us things to come. It is this ever-ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of truth that applies the word of God to the elect &s;inner; and makes is
<PB N="26" REF="030610_0024_0FE830D22109F260">effectual, and the power of God, to &s;alvation. The word comes with power, in the Holy Gho&s;t, and with much a&s;&s;ur|ance. He &s;oftens the hard heart, meekens the &s;tubborn &s;oul, and gives the engrafted word both a place and a root. He induences, and mightily per&s;uades the mind to yield the obe|dience of faith, by crediting the glorious te&s;timony; and makes faith work by love, both to the everla&s;ting go&s;pel and its adorable author. He helps our infirmities at a throne of grace, as a &s;pirit of &s;upplication; makes us feel, and points out our wants; dictates every petition that &s;hall find acceptance, and attends the &s;ame with confidence; and &s;ends them from off the heart with warmth, fervour and energy. And we have the infinite &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing and feeling that they do not return empty. This holy and ever-ble&s;&s;ed Spir|it of truth is the earne&s;t of the great reward; the witne&s;s, &s;ealer, and comforter of every &s;aint of God. But then this <HI>Spirit of truth the world</HI> CANNOT <HI>receive, becau&s;e it &s;eath him not, neither knoweth him.</HI> John xiv. 17. And, if the world, the non-elected world, <HI>cannot</HI> receive him, then they cannot be &s;anctified by him; and without &s;anctification by the Holy Gho&s;t, there can be no meetne&s;s for heaven: the unclean cannot enter there; and <HI>without holine&s;s no man can &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Hence it follows, that, <HI>except a man be born again</HI> of the Spirit, <HI>be cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God,</HI> much le&s;s to enter into it.&mdash;<HI>And, as the world</HI> CANNOT <HI>receive this &s;pirit of truth, then they that go down into the pit cannot hope for it.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>truth</HI> we are to under&s;tand the &s;oul-quickening word of God. <HI>Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.</HI> This word, faithfully and purely preached and cordially received, embraced, and credited, is the incorruptible &s;eed, that abides forever. It is called the word of faith, becau&s;e faith comes by hearing of it, and hearing by the preaching of it. It is called the word of wi&s;dom, becau&s;e it makes us wi&s;e to &s;al|vation through the faith of Chri&s;t: the word of knowledge; becau&s;e it holds forth, and reveals, all that is e&s;&s;ential to be known both of God and our&s;elves: it is the word of life, by which we are quickened: it is the word of righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which we are made ju&s;t; the word of reconciliation, by which we are made friends; and the word of truth, by which we are made free. But then this word is only made to Chri&s;t the elect head, and to his prede&s;tinated offspring. For thus &s;aith God, <HI>This is my covenant with them, the word that I have put in thy mouth, and the &s;pirit that I have put upon thee, &s;hall never depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed's &s;eed, from henceforth and for|ever.</HI>

<P>I come now to treat of the <HI>Pit,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030610_0026_0FE830DA0AD87570">
Which word, according to the learned, has various mean|iags. The word <HI>&s;chool</HI> is u&s;ed in four &s;everal &s;en&s;es in the &s;criptures: Fir&s;t, it is taken for hell metaphorically; that is, for deep plunging into extreme &s;orrow, mi&s;ery, and danger. P&s;. lxxxvi. 13. Secondly, for the local hell properly. Prov. xv. 11. Thirdly, it &s;ignifieth the grave. Prov. xxx. 16.&mdash;Fourthly, it &s;ignifieth the lower, deep, and remote parts of the earth, without any relation to the place of puni&s;hment. P&s;. cxxxix. 8. To which I may add a Fifth acceptation of this word, for the common place or &s;tate of the dead; as P&s;. lxix. 47, 48, &amp;c. <HI>School</HI> &s;ignifieth any devouring gulph, or pit, &s;wallowing up the dead; as Numbers xvi. 33.</P>
<P>That there is an awful and dreadful place of puni&s;hment, prepared by a ju&s;t God for the devil and his angels, and for ungodly &s;inners of mankind, is plain both from the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;|tament and from the <HI>New;</HI> and this truth is realized to the &s;oul and con&s;cience of every &s;inner &s;hut up in black de&s;pair, and given up to a fearful looking for of judgment in this world; and is often dreadfully feared, and the pains of it deep|ly felt, even by the elect of God, when brought under the ar|re&s;ts of divine ju&s;tice, and arraigned at the bar of a broken law: under which dreadful &s;en&s;ations, and awful apprehen&s;ions, have &s;prung tho&s;e fearful cries, and tho&s;e earne&s;t petitions, at|tended with &s;uch grievous complaints, &s;o often found in holy writ; put up by tho&s;e who have &s;unk in the horrible pit, and who have known and felt the terrors of the Lord. Fir&s;t,</P>
<P>We have the outcry of the de&s;pairing &s;inner: <HI>The &s;inners in Zion are afraid; fearfulne&s;s hath &s;urpri&s;ed the hypocrites: who among us &s;hall dwell with devouring fire? who among us &s;hall dwell with everla&s;ting burnings?</HI> I&s;aiah xxxiii. 14. Now this people was either in great fear where no fear was, which is not likely; or el&s;e, like the devils, they believe there is &s;uch a place of tor|ment, and tremble at the dreadful apprehen&s;ions of it, and at the di&s;plea&s;ure of an angry God, who hath prepared it.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have the dreadful complaints of the elect under their awful apprehen&s;ions of this place of torment, when the rod of God has been heavy upon them. <HI>Unto thee will I cry, O Lord, my rock! be not &s;ilent to me, le&s;t if thou be &s;ilent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</HI> P&s;. xxviii. 1.

<P>I know that the word <HI>pit</HI> has various meanings in holy writ: &s;ometimes it &s;ignifies a fal&s;e church, or a whore, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e: in the communion of which many profe&s;&s;ors are &s;o en|tangled as never to get out. <HI>The mouth of a &s;trange woman is a deep pit; the abhorred of the Lord &s;hall f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll therein.</HI> And a whore, in a temporal &s;en&s;e, is called a <HI>pit;</HI> who&s;e en&s;naring charms have held many a pri&s;oner &s;o fa&s;t, that all the la&s;hes of con|&s;cience, and all the dread of damnation, could never deter him, till he has fallen a &s;acrifice to vindictive ju&s;tice. Many a re|probate has peri&s;hed in this &s;nare: <HI>for a whore is a deep ditch, and a &s;trange woman is a narrow pit.</HI> Prov. xxiii. 27.</P>
<P>Sarah's womb is called a <HI>pit;</HI> who was to be the mother of the elect when pa&s;t age; from which (though impo&s;&s;ible to nature) Chri&s;t, according to the fle&s;h, came, and all the elect|ed thou&s;ands, both of Jews and Gentiles, <HI>in him.

<P><HI>Pit</HI> &s;ignifies any wicked device, intended again&s;t a religious per&s;on in order to en&s;nare him and draw him into &s;in, that they may &s;ee his nakedne&s;s and reproach his profe&s;&s;ion: &s;uch as the Hottentots contrive to catch elephants in; who dig holes in the ground, in the tracks where tho&s;e animals come to drink, at the bottom of which &s;takes are driven, and the upper points of them made &s;harp; while the top of the hole is &s;lightly covered with boughs of trees, and then green turf laid over; upon which the unwieldly creature &s;teps, and in

<P><HI>Perdition</HI> &s;ignifies no le&s;s than utter ruin and de&s;truction.&mdash; Judas is called the &s;on or heir of perdition, and is &s;aid to go to his OWN PLACE, from which he will never remove, being mo&s;t worthy of it for his dreadful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and pre or|dained to it for his &s;ins, in which the bounds of his habitation are eternally fixed. Antichri&s;t is likewe&s;e called the &s;on of perdition, being his fellow heir of the &s;ame place; becau&s;e he drives the &s;ame wicked trade with Chri&s;t and his blood as Judas did; and who will at la&s;t go into perdition as well as he, and be drowned in it, for, as for grace or the Holy Spirit, neither he nor Simon Magus have either part or lot in that matter.</P>
<P>Various are the names by which this awful place of tor|ment is called in &s;cripture. It is called <HI>Tophet:</HI> which place
<PB N="31" REF="030610_0029_0FE830E5391670E0">was in the valley of the &s;on of Hinnom, where the children of I&s;rael &s;acrificed their children to Molech. <HI>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the &s;on of Hinnom, to cau&s;e their &s;ons and their daughters to pa&s;s through the fire into Molech.</HI> Jer. xxxii. 35. <HI>Yea, they &s;acrificed their children to devils, and defiled the land with blood.</HI> P&s;. cvi 37. This image had arms, (as &s;ome &s;ay) to hold the infants in, and to which arms they were bound. The image was made hollow within, and a kiln hole was made at the bottom of the image, where the fire was kindled, and kept burning till the child was con&s;umed. Some children they drove through the fire to this idol, and &s;ome were fixed, as above, in the arms of it. The prie&s;ts who offi|ciated at this infernal altar were called <HI>chemarims,</HI> as it is writ|ten; <HI>I will al&s;o &s;tretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place; and the names of the chemarims with the prie&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;Zeph. i. 4. At the times of &s;acrificing the&s;e poor children they u&s;ed to beat <HI>drums,</HI> &amp;c. in order to drown the cries of them when in the fire: on which account, as &s;ome think, this valley is called <HI>Tophet;</HI> which according to the learned, &s;ignifies a <HI>drum:</HI> and God him&s;elf gives it this name to repre&s;ent hell.</P>
<Q><L>Molech, horrid king, be&s;mear'd with blood</L>

<P>And God compares the wicked to the <HI>fuel</HI> with which they burnt their children. And God will kindle a wor&s;e fire than they did; and be as deaf to the cries of them as they were to tho&s;e of their poor infants. <HI>For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a &s;tream of brim&s;tone doth kindle it.</HI> I&s;a. xxx. 33.</P>
<P>Sometimes this place of puni&s;hment is called a <HI>lair;</HI> an allu&s;ion to the plain where anciently &s;tood the four cities of Sodom. Gomorrha, Adma, and Zeboim, which the Lord de&s;troyed by fire. This fine plain, well watered by the river <HI>Jordan</HI> running through it, was the cau&s;e of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> choo&s;ing it when he &s;eparated from <HI>Abraham.</HI> It was anciently a ve|ry rich fertile valley, of &s;eventy miles long, and twenty over: under its turf was a kind of a rich bitumen, and beneath
<PB N="32" REF="030610_0030_0FE830EAAD1759A8">that a pitchy &s;lime, (Gen. xiv. 10.) which they u&s;ed in buil|ding. Compare with Gen. xi. 3. But, when God ramed fire and brim&s;tone from heaven upon tho&s;e cities, the bitu|men and &s;lime took fire al&s;o. The land of the plain, and the whole country, were all on a flame and &s;moke. Gen. xix. 28. <HI>And God overthrew tho&s;e cities:</HI> Gen. xix. 25; that is, with an earthquake, by which a prodigious mountain was ca&s;t up at the we&s;t end of the plain; and the whole plain is now a <HI>dead &s;eo,</HI> called the lake <HI>A&s;pholtites.</HI> The rivers <HI>Jor|dan, Jabbok,</HI> and <HI>Arnon,</HI> all run into it at the ea&s;t end: but there is no way out of it, unle&s;s by a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age. But what is the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing of all is, that, though this lake is fed by fre&s;h water rivers, yet the &s;ea is remarkably &s;alt; and, according to <HI>Maundrell,</HI> prodigious nau&s;eous. The &s;torm of vengeance which fell upon tho&s;e cities is the pledge and earne&s;t of the general conflagration. <HI>As it was in the days of Lot, &s;o &s;hall it be in the days of the Son of Man.</HI> The de|&s;truction of the inhabitants of the&s;e cities is an emblem of the de&s;truction of all the wicked in the great day; who, as well as the Sodomites, <HI>will &s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire;</HI> of which place this &s;ulphureous lake (when all on a flame) was an awful figure or repre&s;entation. <HI>The bea&s;t, and the fal&s;e prophet,</HI> (Rev. xix. 20) <HI>and the Devil that deceived them;</HI> (Rev. xv. 10.) <HI>yea, all who&s;oever were not found written in the book of life;</HI> (Rev. xx. 15.) <HI>the fearful and unbelieving, and the abomin|able, and murderers, and whoremongers, and &s;orcerers, and idola|ters, and all liars, &s;hall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI> Rev. xxi. 8.</P>
<P>Sometimes this place of torment is called a <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> in which all the King of heaven's pri&s;oners are or &s;hall be bound, &s;hut up, and confined. It is prepared for devils, rebels, traitors, reprobates, infidels, hypocrites, heretics, fal&s;e proph|ets, and per&s;ecutors; and all who de&s;cend into it will lie in it until the end of the &s;aint's thou&s;and years reign with Chri&s;t in <HI>the new earth, herein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> 2 Pet. iii. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>at the end of which</HI> time <HI>they &s;hall be vi&s;ited.</HI> The Lord Je&s;us, who has the keys of hell and of death, will bring them forth to the great and grand a&s;&s;ize, to take their trial, receive their deci&s;ive &s;entence and their awful doom.</P>

<P>Again, this place of puni&s;hment is called a <HI>gulph fixed;</HI> which a learned man of God tells me may be properly ren|dered, as it is in the Dutch annotations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>aby&s;s,</HI> or a <HI>bottom|le&s;s pit.</HI> Rev. ix. 1.

<P>I come now to my fourth head; which is to &s;hew.</P>
<P>That they that godown to the pit are without truth. Chri&s;t is eminently and emphatically the truth; but they that go
<PB N="35" REF="030610_0033_0FE830F415C549B8">down into the pit are without Chri&s;t in every covenant char|acter, and in every &s;en&s;e of the word. They have no Medi|ator: and without a Mediator, there can be no acce&s;s to God. Chri&s;t took not on him the &s;eed of Cain, nor of Ca|naan, nor of I&s;hmael, nor of E&s;au: but he took on him the &s;eed of Abraham, and that after he was appointed, made, and declared, the father of many nations, and in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e of all the cho&s;en &s;eed. Chri&s;t <HI>took part of the chil|dren's fle&s;h and blood:</HI> not that of the reprobate, nor of the rejected &s;eed of old Adam, nor that of the children of the fle&s;h; for the&s;e are not the children of God: <HI>but the chil+dren of the promi&s;e are counted for the &s;eed;</HI> and it was part of the fle&s;h of the&s;e heirs of promi&s;e that Chri&s;t took; for &s;uch, and only &s;uch, are the children of Abraham in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture. <Q>They are not all I&s;rael who are of I&s;ra|el, neither becau&s;e they are the &s;eed of Abraham are theyl all the children of God.</Q> Chri&s;t him&s;elf will not allow this. The reprobate Jews told him that <HI>God was their father:</HI> but he tells them that, if God was their father they would love him; and palms them upon their father the devil. And when they claimed Abraham as their father, Chri&s;t allows it in one &s;en&s;e; <HI>I know that ye are Abraham's &s;eed,</HI> (John viii. 37) that is, according to the fle&s;h; but not according to God's purpo&s;e and promi&s;e: therefore <Q>Je&s;us &s;aith unto them if ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abra|ham.</Q> John viii. 39. Chri&s;t never calls the&s;e his brethren, nor does he claim any kindred to them; but tells them to depart, he knows not whence they are, becau&s;e they are not of the election. Chri&s;t is not their advocate nor their inter|ce&s;&s;or: he never pleaded their cau&s;e in eternity, nor yet in time; nor does he now do it in heaven; nor will he do it in the day of judgment, nor yet in hell: but pa&s;&s;es the righte|ous &s;entence of the law upon them, and &s;ends them away from him as utter &s;trangers to him: which cannot be called pleading their cau&s;e again&s;t the devil, when he calls them the devil's own children, and &s;ends them away from him, in company both with the devil and all his angels. Nor did Chri&s;t ever pray for the&s;e as an interce&s;&s;or: for, although he &s;aid upon the cro&s;s, <Q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;</Q> yet it was for &s;ome of the elect in par|ticular that he then prayed; who were very bu&s;y at his cru|cifixion; upon whom Peter charged his blood, and who were cut to the heart at the awful appeal, repented, and believed, and were added to his church. But for the non-elected world he never prayed: <Q>I pray for them; I pray not for the
<PB N="36" REF="030610_0034_0FE830FA6DED08C8">world, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me.</Q> John xvii. 9.</P>
<P>Nor did Chri&s;t die for them: he died not for the genera|tion of &s;erpents, nor vipers, nor for the reprobate, but for the elect; not for the dogs, but for the doves; not for the goats, but for the &s;heep. <Q>The good Shepherd giveth his life for the &s;heep.</Q> John x. 11. <Q>But ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep, as I &s;aid unto you.</Q> John x. 26. And them that are not his &s;heep he never died for: and without redemption by blood there can be no &s;alvation from hell. <HI>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P>Nor did he ever teach the&s;e as a prophet. No; he came to them for judgment, that they which &s;ee might be made blind: yea, he clo&s;ed their eyes, &s;topped their ears, and har|dened their hearts; that they &s;hould not &s;ee with their eyes, hear with their ears, nor under&s;tand with their hearts. He never turned them to him, nor took the veil from them; but thanked his Father for hiding the&s;e things from them: and declares that <HI>the wicked &s;hall do wickedly,</HI> and that <HI>none of the wicked &s;hall under&s;tand.</HI> Dan. xii. 10. They may ever learn; but, like Mr. Winche&s;ter, they are <HI>never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</HI> and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the great Prophet of the church never teaches them. <HI>All thy children &s;hall be taught of the Lord,</HI> and none el&s;e. <HI>The natural man di&s;cerns not the things of the &s;pirit; nor</HI> CAN <HI>he know them,</HI> either in time or eternity, <HI>becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI>&mdash;And the Holy Spirit does not teach the world: <HI>The</HI> (repro|bate) <HI>world</HI> CANNOT <HI>receive him,</HI> either in this world or the next, <HI>becau&s;e it &s;eeth him not, neither knoweth him.</HI> John xiv. 17. Therefore <HI>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth.</HI></P>
<P>And, as they that are of this world are not Chri&s;t's &s;heep, &s;o he never gathers them out of it; he never &s;eeks them out, nor finds them. He &s;eeks none but the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; and the other &s;heep, which are not of that fold (namely, the elect among the Gentiles,) the&s;e he mu&s;t bring, and there &s;hall be one fold and one &s;hepherd.&mdash;For <HI>the&s;e</HI> he died; <HI>the&s;e</HI> he redeemed; <HI>the&s;e</HI> he gathers out of all places, whither &s;cattered in the cloudy and dark days.&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;ed of <HI>the&s;e</HI> he &s;trengthens; the lame he heals; the broken he binds up; the weak he lays on his &s;houlders; the lambs he carries in his bo&s;om; and tho&s;e that are with young he gently leads. In the height of I&s;rael he pitches their
<PB N="37" REF="030610_0035_0FE830FBF3911490">fold, in the green pa&s;tures of the life-giving go&s;pel he makes them to lie down, and by the &s;till waters of comfort he leads them. But, though this kind Shepherd deals thus with his &s;heep, yet not &s;o with the goats, as him&s;elf &s;ays: <Q>I will feed the flock of &s;laughter; even you, O poor of the flock: and I took unto me two &s;taves; the one I called beauty, and the other I called bands, or binders; and I fed the flock.</Q> Zech. xi. 7. Here is Chri&s;t the King of I&s;rael with his beautiful <HI>&s;taff,</HI> or <HI>&s;ceptre,</HI> ruling and governing his own &s;ub|jects; and with his other <HI>&s;taff,</HI> called <HI>binders</HI> or <HI>bands,</HI> which is his <HI>&s;hepherd's crook,</HI> that catches, holds fa&s;t, and detains ev|ery &s;heep of his flock to him&s;elf, and to one another in his own fold; while he him&s;elf conde&s;cends to feed them. But then he has no charge of the <HI>goats,</HI> he is a <HI>&s;hepherd,</HI> not an <HI>herd&s;man;</HI> nor does he feed them, as him&s;elf declares: <Q>Then, &s;aid I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the re&s;t eat every one the fle&s;h of another.</Q> Zech. xi. 9. Hence it appears plain that the good Shepherd has no charge of the&s;e; nor does he put forth his crook among them. Nay, he a&s;ked <HI>what they would give for his price</HI> in this twofold of|fice of mediatorial king and good Shepherd; 'and they pri|zed him at the common price of a bond &s;lave.' Exod. xxi. 32; compare with Zech. xi. 12. <Q>Then he cut a&s;under his &s;taff, even beauty? that he might break the legal, national, and conditional covenant, that he had made with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael;</Q> (Zech. xi. 10) for their di&s;obedience to it, and for their rejection of him: <Q>and the middle wall of partition was broken down on that day;</Q> and &s;alvation was proclai|med to the Gentiles: and, after they had &s;old his blood, and him&s;elf as their &s;hepherd and king, <Q>then he cut a&s;under his other &s;taff, even bands, that he might break the brother|hood between the &s;piritual Jews and I&s;rael after the fle&s;h.</Q> Zech. xi. 14. 'And it was broken in that day.' Zech. xi. 11. So that <Q>they are not Jews that are &s;o <HI>outwardly,</HI> but are of the &s;ynagogue of &s;atan; but they are Jews that are &s;uch <HI>inwardly;</HI> and circumci&s;ion is that of the heart, in the &s;pir|it, and not in the letter; who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men, but of God.</Q> From hence it appears plain that the Lord Je&s;us does not undertake for the reprobate, the goats, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent; but for the &s;heep, which the Father has giv|en him; for whom he died, and whom he <Q>redeemed from among men, out of every kindred, people, tongue, and na|tion.</Q> Rev. v. 9.</P>

Nor does the grace of Chri&s;t rule over the reprobate.&mdash;His kingdom is not of this world; it is not of men, but of God; not &s;upported by worldly means or worldly maxims; nor are the &s;ubjects of it of this world, but of God. It is &s;et up in the hearts of God's elect, and in no other. Satan is a king &s;till, and has a kingdom; and his kingdom &s;till &s;tands, and his &s;ubjects are led captive by him at his will.

All which prove, plain enough, that &s;atan (not Je&s;us) is king oyer all the children of pride; and that he rules in the hearts of all the children of di&s;obedience.&mdash;But he (Chri&s;t) turns his own people from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan to God; and tran&s;lates them out of the kingdom of &s;atan into his own kingdom, where they find the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and a glorious inheritance among them that are &s;anctified by faith that is in him.&mdash;Hence we conclude that, as Chri&s;t did not a&s;&s;ume the na|ture of the reprobates, &s;o he is not the mediator, advocate, interce&s;&s;or, prie&s;t, &s;hepherd, or king, of the&s;e. God has &s;et his King upon his holy hill of Zion, not upon Sinai; for all that are of the works of the law are under the cur&s;e.

<P>I have long wondered from whence the Arminians got this notion of an univer&s;al re&s;toration; there never was one text in God's book to countenance or &s;upport it. I though it had been a branch of Pythagoreani&s;m; but, on referring to a note in Virgil's Aeneid, I rather doubted it; for I find that Plato, Socrates, and others of the ancient philo&s;ophers, held the &s;entiment as well as Pythagoras. The following pa&s;&s;age from Pitt's tran&s;lation of the Aeneid contains the &s;ub&s;tance of Mr. Winche&s;ter's doctrine: but from which of the heathen philo&s;ophers Virgil has taken it, or whether he has compoun|ded their different opinions, and reduced them into the fol|lowing &s;y&s;tem, is a point, I believe, undetermined.</P>

However, Mr. Winche&s;ter differs from Virgil; for he makes no u&s;e of the &s;treams, or the wind, only of the flame.

<P N="5">5. The fifth ob&s;tacle in the way of Mr. Winche&s;ter's <HI>uni|ver&s;al re&s;toration</HI> is, God's declaration of never forgetting any of the works of the wicked. The favour that God bears to the objects of his choice is often expre&s;&s;ed by a remembrance of them. <Q>God remembered Abraham, and &s;ent Lot out of the mid&s;t of the overthrow, when he overthrew tho&s;e cities in which Lot dwelt.</Q> Gen. xix. 29. And thus <HI>God remem|bered Rachel;</HI> Gen. xxx. 22; and <HI>God remembered Hannah.</HI> 1 Sam. i. 19. And indeed the elect can never be forgotten; for Chri&s;t was made of God unto them wi&s;dom, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption, from all eternity; and as &s;uch, 'the righteous are had in everla&s;ting remembrance,' (P&s;. cxii. 6) when the very 'name of the wicked &s;hall rot.' The pardon of &s;in is often mentioned by a non-remembrance of it: <Q>I will be merciful to their unrighteou&s;ne&s;&s;es, and their &s;ins and iniquities I will remember no more.</Q> Jer. xxxi. 34. That is, I will blot them out of the book of my remembrance, for my dear Son's &s;ake; and they &s;hall come into my mind no more, nor ever appear before me as an aggravation; nor before my people to their condemnation; and, if they are &s;ought for, they &s;hall not be found, for there &s;hall be none. But though the righteous are <Q>to be had in everla&s;ting re|membrance; </Q> (P&s;alm cxii. 6) yet there are &s;ome that he never will remember; that is, he never will remember them 'with the favour that he bears to his own people,' (P&s;. cvi. 4) but forget them. <Q>Therefore, behold I, even I, will ut|terly forget you, and I will for&s;ake you, and the city that I gave to your fathers, and ca&s;t you out of my pre&s;ence: and I will bring an everla&s;ting reproach upon you, and a perpetual &s;hame, which &s;hall not be forgotten.</Q> Jer. xxiii. 39, 40. Utterly to forget a man is to &s;hew him no favour: <Q>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will &s;hew them no favour.</Q> I&s;a. xxvii. 11. The &s;ins of &s;uch men were never blotted out by the blood of
<PB N="47" REF="030610_0045_0FE8311AA10FCE60">Chri&s;t, and therefore mu&s;t &s;tand upon the book of God's re|membrance again&s;t them forever. <Q>The &s;in of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a dia|mond; it is graven upon the table of their heart, and up|on the horns of your altar. The Lord hath &s;worn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</Q> Amos viii. 7. If the name of the wicked &s;hall rot, and God will utterly forget them with re&s;pect to either fa|vour or mercy; and if the &s;ins of &s;uch are to &s;tand upon the book of his remembrance forever, unpardoned and unblotted out by the blood of Chri&s;t; and this confirmed by the &s;ol|emn oath of God, by the excellency of Jacob, which is God him&s;elf; then it mu&s;t follow that <HI>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixth impediment that lies in the way of this uni|ver&s;al re&s;toration is, that 'the great atonement of Chri&s;t <HI>does not, &s;hall not,</HI> yea, <HI>cannot</HI> reach them;' and <Q>without &s;hedding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion;</Q> and Chri&s;t did not die for every individual of mankind. <Q>He gave his life a ran&s;om for many;</Q> yea, for <HI>all the elect,</HI> to be te&s;tified in due time. But it is not, it never was and it never will be te&s;tified to <HI>all mankind.</HI> Chri&s;t ran&s;oms <HI>bis elect</HI> from the cur&s;e of the law, from &s;piritual and eternal death, from temporal death as a penal evil, and from the power of the grave; yea, and from this dreadful pit mentioned in my text. <Q>Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ran&s;om.</Q> Job xxxiii. 24. But, although this ran&s;om is the procuring cau&s;e of God's elect being delivered from going down into the pit, yet it never did, nor ever will, deliver one &s;inner from the pit that goes into it, when once <Q>judgment and ju&s;tice take hold on him Becau&s;e there is wrath, beware le&s;t he take thee away with his &s;troke, then a great ran&s;om cannot deliver thee.</Q> Job xxxvi. 17, 18. And, if this great ran&s;om cannot deliver them, then there can be no other gaol delivery for the damn|ed than that which lies in the whims of Mr. Winche&s;ter, who knows <HI>neither the &s;criptures nor the power of God. They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;eventh particular that militates again&s;t this jubi|lee of devils is, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf keeps the keys both of hell and of death, as well as the keys of the hou&s;e of David: and as they become no hand but his, &s;o he will never tru&s;t either the pope or Mr. Winche&s;ter with them. It is he that admits all his elect into his own hou&s;ehold; he &s;hut N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">:

<P N="8">8. The eighth impediment in the way of this univer&s;al gaol delivery is, the inviolable oath and veracity of God. <Q>There are two immutable things in which it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie.</Q> In the behalf of God's elect they are brought in to uncourage the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance, and, to e&s;tabli&s;h an ev|erla&s;ting con&s;olation. To the&s;e God &s;hews the immutabilty of his coun&s;el, confirmed by an oath. Heb. vi. 17. And there is an awful denunciation, confirmed by oath again&s;t the wick|ed, which divine reracity mu&s;t make good; for <Q>God is not man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould re|pent. Hath he &s;aid, and &s;hall he not do it? hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not make it good?</Q> Num. xxiii. 19. <Q>In that day will I perform again&s;t Eli all things which I have &s;po|ken concerning his hou&s;e; when I begin I will al&s;o make an end: for I have told him that I will judge his hou&s;e forev|er, for the iniquity which he knoweth, becau&s;e his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile, and he re&s;trained them not; and therefore I have &s;worn <HI>(juravi)</HI> unto the hou&s;e of Eli, that the iniqui|ty of Eli's hou&s;e &s;hall not be purged by &s;acrifice nor offer|ing forever.</Q> 1 Sam. iii, 14. Such de&s;perate and willful &s;inners as the&s;e find no &s;acrifice for &s;in; a great ran&s;om can|not deliver them; they &s;hall not be purged either with &s;acri|fice or offering forever; and God has &s;worn to it; therefore <HI>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P>But, if this oath and threatening, and the date thereof, <HI>(forever)</HI> be objected to, then let Mr. Winche&s;ter object to all the following oaths, which are the &s;ame&mdash;the very &s;ame.&mdash; <Q>For I have &s;aid, Mercy &s;hall be built up forever; thy faith|fulne&s;s &s;halt thou e&s;tabli&s;h in the very heavens.

And again; <Q>Now when I pa&s;&s;ed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was a time of love; and I &s;pread my &s;kirt over thee, and covered thy nakedne&s;s; yea, I <HI>&s;ware unto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, (juravi)</HI> and entered into covenant with thee, &s;aith the Lord God, and thou became&s;t mine.</Q> Ezek. xvi. 8.&mdash;Again, <Q>The Lord &s;ware, and will not repent, thou art a prie&s;t <HI>forever and ever,</HI> after the order of Melchi&s;ede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</Q> The eternal throne of Chri&s;t, the eternal e&s;tabli&s;tment of his &s;eed, and the mercy of God to them; together with the eternal prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, and the everla&s;ting covenant with the elect in him; are all e&s;tabli&s;hed, fixed, and &s;ettled, by oath: <HI>all</HI> which mu&s;t be, removed, and God be proved to be perjur|ed, before hir. Winche&s;ter's gaol delivery can take place: for the &s;tate and doom of the damned are fixed by the &s;ame oath: and the duration of their &s;tate bears the &s;ame date as the oth|er. <Q>I have <HI>&s;worn (juravi)</HI> that I <HI>never</HI> will forget any of their works.</Q> Amos viii. 7. <Q>I have <HI>&s;worn (juravi)</HI> that the hou&s;e of Eli &s;hall not be purged forever,</Q> 1 Sam. iii. 14. <Q>Unto whom I <HI>&s;ware</HI> in my wrath that they &s;hould not enter into my re&s;t.</Q> P&s;. xcv. 11; Heb. iii. 11. <Q>They <HI>could</HI> not enter in becau&s;e of unbelief; for he that believes not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him.</Q> It abideth on him, and &s;hall never be removed from him, for <HI>he that believes not &s;hall be damned. They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The ninth ob&s;tacle in the way of this univer&s;al reprieve is, that there is no forgivene&s;s in the day of judgment, nor in hell, for them that die in their &s;ins. The elect are pardoned in this world, and ju&s;tified freely from all things; and they &s;hall be pronounced ble&s;&s;ed, pardoned, and ju&s;tified, at the bar of God in the great day; and to this end they &s;hall all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t. But they, that are not ble&s;&s;ed nor pardoned in this world never &s;hall be pro|nounced ble&s;&s;ed or pardoned in the world to come; for not in <HI>hell,</HI> but in <Q>Mount Zion, in Jeru&s;alem, and in the remnant whom the Lord &s;hall call, &s;hall there be deliverance. The fountain is opened for the hou&s;e of David, and the inhab|itants of Jeru&s;alem;</Q> not for the congregation of the dead, nor for them in the depths of hell. <Q>Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall die in your &s;ins.

<P N="10">10. We know that there is a &s;in unto death which is the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and which is unpardonable, and there|fore mu&s;t militate hard again&s;t Mr. Winche&s;ter's univer&s;al re&s;|toration. <Q>But he that &s;hall bla&s;pheme again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t hath never forgivene&s;s, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</Q> Mark iii. 29. But not only the&s;e de&s;perate &s;inners, but all who die impenitent and unpardoned, &s;hall be excluded from the kingdom of heaven. <Q>They that &s;in with|out law &s;hall peri&s;h without law; and they that &s;in in the law &s;hall be judged by the law;</Q> and they that hear the go&s;|pel, and believe not, &s;hall be damned; and, if they are, their &s;entence &s;hall never be recalled; for <HI>they that go down in|to the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. They who peri&s;h are without a <HI>helper.</HI> The &s;inner that falls into this pit will &s;oon find all his hopes of a re&s;tora|tion peri&s;h with him. The&s;e petty contrivances are trumped up by &s;atan only to amu&s;e him while he is in the land of the living.

<P N="13">13. The &s;inner's debt book is another ob&s;tacle in the way of this univer&s;al enlargement. We know that God is called a creditor; and perfect obedience to the precepts of the law is due to him; but all have &s;inned, and the &s;inner is God's debtor. Some owe fifty pence, and &s;ome five hundred, and &s;ome ten thou&s;and talents; and &s;uch are bound over to pun|i&s;hment, unle&s;s the&s;e debts be cancelled, which they cannot be, but by the blood of Chri&s;t; <HI>for without &s;hedding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> But then Chri&s;t died for his &s;heep, not for the goats; he redeemed his people from among men, he did not redeem all men: as a &s;urety he did not pay their debts; the book debt, the hand writing, is &s;till again&s;t them; it is not taken out of the way; it is not nailed to the cro&s;s; their &s;ins are not blotted out of the book of God's remembrance; <Q>and God has &s;worn by his excellency that he never will forget any of their works.</Q> Amos viii. 7. <Q>The unrighteous &s;hall not enter into the kingdom of heaven;</Q> imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s is not on them; and they have no righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own; and without righteou&s;ne&s;s they <Q>cannot &s;tand in the judgment, nor &s;hall they ever &s;tand in the congregation of the righteous?

Chri&s;t prayed not for the world: not are we al|lowed &s;o much as to pray for &s;uch as bear <HI>the evident tokens of perdition,</HI> or of the <HI>unpardonable &s;in.</HI> <Q>There is a &s;in unto death, I do not &s;ay that ye &s;hall pray for it,</Q> 1 John v. 16. And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the pardon is never to be granted.&mdash;Nor does the Spirit ever help the infirmities of a child of God, at a throne of grace, for any per&s;on that is dead, though the neare&s;t and deare&s;t friend he ever had: for he believes in his heart that the die is immediately ca&s;t upon the death of the per&s;on, and the doom forever fixed, and that prayer will then avail nothing. And in this I can appeal to the experience of all good men who are taught of God. David wept, fa&s;ted, and prayed for the child, as long as life la&s;ted; but when it was dead he left off. 2 Sam. xii. 22. His prayer would not bring the child back to life; much le&s;s will prayer bring a &s;oul from hell to heaven. Now, if we are not even in this world to pray for an unpardonable &s;inner, are we to pray for him when in the bottomle&s;s pit? Purgatory, and &s;alvation from it, and prayers for the dead and damned, are not from Chri&s;t, but from antichri&s;t. The notion was invented by Pla|to, Pythagoras, &amp;c. it was adopted by the pope for gain, and is &s;upported and defended by Mr. Winche&s;ter as his la&s;t re|fuge from the &s;torm. But for my part, I &s;hall never have any opinion of Mr. Winche&s;ter's &s;incerity, in his doctrine of univer&s;al re&s;toration, unle&s;s he adopts the ma&s;s, ab&s;olution, extreme anction, prayers and paterno&s;ters for the dead; for all the&s;e things are in&s;eparably connected with purgatory, and re&s;toration from thence. <HI>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. The doubtfulne&s;s of Mr Winche&s;ter's mi&s;&s;ion and com|mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t to preach this doctrine is another entan|glement upon his &s;y&s;tem. When Chri&s;t &s;ent his apo&s;tles out he endued them with power from on high; filled them with the Holy Gho&s;t; armed them with grace and truth; and bid them preach the go&s;pel to every creature; and that he that believed &s;hould be &s;aved, and he that believed not &s;hould be damned. All whom by their mini&s;try they bound on earth, in heaven were bound; and all whom they loo&s;ed on earth, in heaven were loo&s;ed. They were to &s;eek the king|dom of God, and the elected &s;ubjects of it; to &s;eek the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and the &s;ons ordained to peace among the Gentiles; and to <Q>endure all things for the elect's

And Paul was &s;ent 'to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan to God, that they might receive the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and an inher|itance among them that are &s;anctified by faith that is in Chri&s;t.</Q> But there is not a word about the &s;alvation of de|vils and reprobates in all their commi&s;&s;ions. They were not to convert men from natural darkne&s;s to utter darkne&s;s; nor from truth into the law of nature to the lies of &s;atan; nor from hell to heaven; nor were they &s;ent to turn &s;in from &s;atan, nor &s;atan to God; much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to convert &s;ouls from union with Zion to fellow&s;hip with devils: but they were &s;ent to turn &s;inners to God from &s;in and Satan.

<P N="27">27. The characteri&s;tics that attend Mr. Winche&s;ter in this his office militate hard again&s;t him. The apo&s;tles and mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t were to be hated of all men for his name's &s;ake; and <Q>ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men revile and per&s;ecute you for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake.</Q> But Mr. Winche&s;ter's doctrine is well calculated to cau&s;e the offence of the cro&s;s to cea&s;e; for who can object to &s;uch a doctrine? None but the children of God! Impo&s;tors, apo&s;tates, hypocrites, mini&s;ters of &s;atan, hirelings. Simoni&s;ts, rebels, traitors, de&s;peradoes, per&s;ecutors, perjured per&s;ons, whoremongers, Sodomites, u&s;urers, grinders of the poor, oppre&s;&s;ors, witches, wizards; yea, and devils al&s;o, if they have but faith, mu&s;t approve and rejoice in this doctrine: <Q>but he that preaches to plea&s;e (&s;uch) men cannot be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t;</Q> then he mu&s;t be the mini&s;ter of &s;atan, for there are but two ma&s;ters. <Q>Wo unto you, &s;ays Chri&s;t, when all men &s;hall &s;peak well of you, for &s;o did their fathers to the fal&s;e prophets.</Q> Luke vi. 26.

<P N="37">37. Man Mr. Winche&s;ter a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on that is peculiar to faith, or any natural rea&s;on that is common to man, why Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;et forth for a &s;ign that &s;hould be &s;po|ken again&s;t; Why he &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men,
<PB N="69" REF="030610_0067_0FE831582BDEF118">the &s;corn of the world, and the &s;tumbling block of the wicked? and why they &s;hould be eternally ble&s;&s;ed, who&s;o|ever &s;hould not be offended in him?&mdash;Why he &s;hould be called a deceiver, a fellow, yea, Beelzebub the devil; and his followers be hated of all men for his name's &s;ake? and why they who re&s;i&s;ted the&s;e enemies unto blood &s;hould be owned and honoured before the angels of God; while &s;uch as were awed by them, and became fearful of their rage, &s;hould be the <HI>fir&s;t rank</HI> that &s;hould <HI>march</HI> to hell?&mdash;Why the wicked &s;hould cur&s;e both their King and their God in the day of judgment, when their re&s;toration is drawing &s;o nigh; and at the &s;ame time this Saviour, who is their &s;tumbling block and rock of offence, again&s;t whom all their indigna|tion is leveiled, &s;hould be their only &s;avious, and their uni|ver&s;al re&s;torer? Some impre&s;&s;ions of the future puni&s;hments and promi&s;ed rewards of God have ever been deeply &s;tamp|ed on the minds of the children of men, however le&s;t, be|reft, rude, or uncultivated, they may have been. Hence we read, among the heathen writers, of the gulph of Tartarus, or hell, Orcus, or Hades; of Pluto's cave; of the infer|nal rivers, Cocytus, Acheron, Styx, and Phlogethon; of harpies, gorgons, hydras, and furies (intimating perhaps the horrors of a guilty mind); and the puni&s;hments of Ix|ion, Tantalus, Sy&s;iphus, and others. We read al&s;o of the Ely&s;ian plains, the happy abodes of the ju&s;t after death; and of a particular number ordained by fate for the enjoy|ment of them. So Virgil writes of "a choice &s;elected few," and of the "cho&s;en few who gain Ely&s;ium." But there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that even the heathens believed in the re&s;toration of all the condemned criminals in hell; &s;uch as Cacus, Sy&s;iphus, Tantalus, Ixion, the Titans, the Belides, &amp;c. We do not read of any purifications by fire, wind, or water, pa&s;&s;ing, or to pa&s;s, upon the&s;e; that &s;eems entirely confined to "the cho&s;en few," to qualify them for Ely&s;ium. The idea of univer&s;al re&s;toration was never by God implant|ed in nature, nor was it ever revealed by grace.</P>
<P>Plato, the heathen philo&s;opher, circulated this purgation by fire, and re&s;toration from hell, three hundred years be|fore Chri&s;t; and Origen, according to the account of the learned, was the fir&s;t that brought it into the chri&s;tian church. But then the heathens wor&s;hipped devils, not God; and the&s;e our Gentile <HI>fathers inherited lies,</HI> (Jer. xvi. 19) and this is one; for <HI>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="030610_0068_0FE7EC4E54954598">
Nor can any rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned why the devils &s;hould have &s;uch an inveterate hatred to Chri&s;t, if he is the great re&s;tor|er of them; nor why Satan &s;hould from age to age tempt the Children of Chri&s;t, as he did Job to bla&s;pheme; Peter, and numbers more, to deny him; nor why he &s;hould &s;tir up princes to oppo&s;e him and murder his children, and the Pope and Mahomet to revile him; Simon Magus, and the judaizing teachers, athei&s;ts, dei&s;ts, Socinians, Arians, and Arminians, to oppo&s;e and traduce him; to &s;educe and mi&s;|lead his followers; to attempt to weaken his intere&s;t and de&s;troy his kingdom. No rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for all this malice of devils, if Chri&s;t is their great benefactor; nor can any rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned why the devil &s;hould &s;eek the death and de&s;truction of Chri&s;t, from the manger to the cro&s;s; nor why he &s;hould tempt the Lord to &s;elf murder, and to wor&s;hip him; nor why he &s;hould &s;tir up the Jews to crucify him, and bring him under the cur&s;e of God. Had all their &s;chemes &s;ucceeded, their re&s;toration mu&s;t have mi&s;|carried. In all the&s;e things Satan mu&s;t be divided again&s;t him&s;elf; unle&s;s it can be &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Winche&s;ter, and none el&s;e, is in this &s;ecret. But the truth of the matter is, the devil's faith is firmly fixed in the everla&s;ting cur&s;e and wrath of God; and therefore he a&s;ked Chri&s;t if he was come to torment him before the time. In the&s;e things the devils believe, and tremble; and in this the devil is right, and Mr. Winche&s;ter wrong; for <HI>they that go down to the pit cannot hope for thy truth,</HI></P>
<P N="39">39. In all other pits <HI>there is hope,</HI> but in this mentioned in my text <HI>there is none.</HI> There is hope in the horrible pit, for many have been brought out of <HI>that;</HI> and there is hope in the grave; the du&s;t of the &s;aints &s;hall re&s;t in hope; but in <HI>the bottomle&s;s pit</HI> there is none.</P>
<P>The eternal exi&s;tence of Chri&s;t, and the eternal chains of the devils, bear one and the &s;ame date. The everla&s;ting &s;tate of the ju&s;t, and that of the wicked in hell, bear one and the &s;ame date. And both are fixed by the word of God and by his inviolable oath; which are 'two immutable 'things, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie.' <HI>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. Mr. Winche&s;ter, in all his books, has not publi&s;hed one truth in defence of this re&s;toration; nor has he produ|ced, nor can he produce, one text, in God's book to prove

<P>This doctine of the re&s;toration is denied by God the Father upon oath. Amos viii. 7; Heb. iii. 11. It is denied by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t the judge of quick and dead. Mark ix. 44. It is denied by the Holy Gho&s;t, and by the eternal decree of hea|ven. 1 The&s;. ii. 11, 12. It is denied by every prophet and apo&s;tle that has mentioned the &s;tate of the damned. I&s;a. lxvi. 24; Mal. iv. 2; 2 The&s;. i. 9; Jude 7; Pet. ii. 12. It is denied by the &s;anction of the eternal law; (Luke xvi. 17.) by the awful &s;entence annexed to the everla&s;ting go&s;pel; (Mark xvi. 16) by the angel Gabriel; (Dan. xii. 2) by the experience of every child of God; and by the Spirit's witne&s;s and the truth of grace in all &s;aints. It is denied by Abraham the father of the faithful in heaven, and by the groans of the damned in hell. Luke xvi. 24, 25, 26. It is denied by the feelings of Cain, E&s;au, Judas,, and every de&s;pairing &s;inner. It is denied by the law of nature; by the te&s;timony of hea|thens, who only mention 'a cho&s;en few;' and by the conduct of devils. It is denied by the internal monitor of every min|i&s;ter of &s;atan, and con&s;equently by the con&s;cience of Mr. Winche&s;ter him&s;elf, <HI>the wor&s;t of liars; for they that go down into the pit mu&s;t not, &s;hall not,</HI> yea <HI>cannot, hope for thy truth.</HI></P>
