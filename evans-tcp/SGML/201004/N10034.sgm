<L>IMPERIAL JOB grew old without a care;</L>

<L>Each comfort heaven unweariedly be&s;tow'd;</L>

<L>But now he mu&s;t his ble&s;&s;edne&s;s forego,</L>

<L>His body &s;car'd and &s;potted o'er with pain.</L>

<L>And &s;ee his greatne&s;s writhe by thee confin'd;</L>
<L>Will he with &s;upplications court relea&s;e?</L>
<L N="280">Or with his mighty &s;ports thy maidens plea&s;e?</L>
<L>Shall the glad merchants own &s;o rich a prey,</L>
<L>And to &s;ea-fever'd marts their &s;hares convey?</L>
<L>Let kings again&s;t him join, in furious war</L>
<L>And &s;eek one fang or &s;cale to load their car.</L>
<L N="285">Incapable of wound, he knows no fear,</L>
<L>Nor can be wak'd by the rebounding &s;pear.</L>
<L>To &s;catter death, he fiercely takes delight,</L>
<L>When once the &s;trong, provoke him to the fight.</L>
<L>The &s;toute&s;t, JOB, are not a&s;hamed to flee,</L>
<L N="290">Who then &s;hall ever dare to turn on me?</L>
<L>Am I indebted for the gifts I own?</L>
<L>Behold whatever lives, is mine alone.</L>
<L>Where'er the zephyr breathes, or genial &s;hower</L>
<L>The parched meadow glads; or fragrant flower</L>
<L N="295">Perfumes the plain; where'er the orient dew</L>
<L>Adorns with pearl each &s;weetly blu&s;hing hue;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="012749_0013_0F8BED41B9137B10">
Where'er the fruitage &s;hoots, or loaded tree</L>
<L>All breathe, glad, perfume, blu&s;h and &s;hoot from me.</L>
<L>See my Leviathan prepare to ri&s;e,</L>
<L N="300">And heave his ample &s;tature to the &s;kies:</L>
<L>His &s;caly height maje&s;tically rolls,</L>
<L>His eye the nations of the flood controuls,</L>
<L>Broad as the morn, when it begins to ri&s;e.</L>
<L>His adamantine &s;kin, the &s;pear defies.</L>
<L N="305">Whene'er he breathes, the frighted floods retire,</L>
<L>He breathes a cloud of mingled &s;moke and fire.</L>
<L>Survey with fear: What fangs! What &s;cales are &s;een!</L>
<L>So clo&s;e no air can edge its way between.</L>
<L>His harden'd jaws, like &s;pacious doors, unfold;</L>
<L N="310">His teeth the mighty with di&s;may, behold.</L>
<L>When for his &s;port, he &s;tains the waves with mud;</L>
<L>Behold va&s;t &s;tones uprais'd &s;wim thro' the flood.</L>
<L>The ocean with the &s;kies, a tempe&s;t blends,</L>
<L>When thro' the deep his hoary way he bends:</L>
<L N="315">The di&s;tant mariner the track de&s;cries,</L>
<L>And from the furrow'd foam, with terror flies.</L>
<L>His hugene&s;s now buoyant on the &s;treams,</L>
<L>His &s;cales pour back again&s;t the &s;un, his beams.</L>
<L>Is ought on earth &s;o &s;trong, beyond compare,</L>
<L N="320">So utterly incapable of fear!</L>
<L>Then the Chaldean all his crime deplor'd;</L>
<L>Trembling he ceas'd to murmur, and ador'd.</L>
<L>Thy might is wonderful, great king of kings,</L>
<L>Thou can&s;t perform unutterable things.</L>
<L N="325">Thine ire if once incens'd who can endure;</L>
<L>To thee compar'd arch-&s;eraphs are impure.</L>
<L>From thy pervading eye is ought conceal'd;</L>
<L>Lo! every thought before thee &s;tands reveal'd.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="012749_0014_0F8BED4278C70CA8">
How deeply are thy coun&s;els hid from men?</L>
<L N="330">Thy wond'rous purpo&s;es &s;urpa&s;s their ken.</L>
<L>Should Heaven's bright ho&s;t a&s;pire to reign with thee;</L>
<L>And with thy godhead claim equality;</L>
<L>Thou might'&s;t on all that va&s;t refulgent train,</L>
<L N="335">Look from thy throne, with infinite di&s;dain.</L>
<L>This have I heard; but never could I &s;ee</L>
<L>Till now, thy wi&s;dom, might and purity.</L>
<L>Hence my rebellious thoughts &s;hall all be &s;lain,</L>
<L>My work &s;hall be to wor&s;hip not complain.</L>
