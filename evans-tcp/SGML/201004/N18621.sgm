<HEAD>A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to her temper of mind, her views of &s;upernatural objects, and her ap|prehen&s;ions with regard to the &s;tate of her &s;oul to|wards GOD, &s;he related as follows:</P>
<P>From my youth up to my fir&s;t awakening, I lived without GOD in the world, in a &s;tupified forgetful|ne&s;s of the obligations I had ever been under to him. and of the &s;olemn account I mu&s;t one day render un|to him of the deeds done in the body, and of all my views and aims; till it plea&s;ed a &s;overeign GOD, two years ago la&s;t July, to &s;end his &s;pirit to con|vince me of my &s;ins, and lay open to my view the awful danger that was impending over me. At which time my &s;ins were &s;et in order before me, in &s;uch dreadful array, and the enmity of my heart, and my native oppo&s;ition to GOD, ari&s;ing to my view, produced &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s and agony of &s;oul, as to overpower all &s;en&s;e of bodily pain, though I had for &s;ome time before been exerci&s;ed with &s;evere di&s;|tre&s;s in body, and was at this time reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, accompanied with continual wrecking pain, that my life was almo&s;t de&s;paired of from day to day.</P>
<P>It appears to me a&s;toni&s;hing, upon every recol|lection, that the agony of my mind did not di&s;olve the frame of my nature, and how I could &s;ub&s;i&s;t un|der the &s;mart and agony of &s;uch a wounded &s;pirit.
<PB N="3" REF="024164_0003_0FC3DFA0C66BE3F0">
It &s;eems to me now, that had it continued much longer, it mu&s;t unavoidably have overpowered the remains of life in me, and put a period to my exi&s;t|ence on earth. But after having remained for &s;ev|eral days in this angui&s;h of &s;pirit, and dreadful bon|dage of &s;oul, I found relief in a manner mo&s;t unex|pected.</P>
<P>After I had laid my&s;elf down on my bed, my mind was led to a mo&s;t delightful and realizing view of the entire &s;afety of tru&s;ting in the Divine Power and Mercy; that there was &s;uch a fullne&s;s in GOD, of that which I needed for relief and comfort, that my heart within me was con&s;trained to rejoice, and could not but roll my burden upon the Lord. At this time the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, in which he &s;ays, "Thou ha&s;t brought my feet up out of the miry clay," &amp;c. were to my &s;oul &s;weeter than honey or the honey-comb; and al&s;o the 16th hymn of the third book of Dr. WATTS'S Hymns, was to my &s;oul like a fea&s;t of fat things, and of wine upon the lees. For &s;ome con&s;iderable time after this, I enjoyed, al|mo&s;t without any intermi&s;&s;ion, a mo&s;t &s;weet and re|fre&s;hing &s;en&s;e of the beauty and glory of divine ob|jects. But not under&s;tanding the treachery of my own heart, and the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, I was allured away by degrees, into a forgetfulne&s;s of GOD, and from a clo&s;e walk with him, through an apprehen|&s;ion that I might innocently indulge my&s;elf in join|ing with young people in what is u&s;ually termed civil merriment; and which I was induced to do more e&s;pecially and principally that I might not be|come an object of ridicule among them. But before I was aware of the danger I had incurred by turning in &s;uch a manner to vanity, I found that my heart was &s;en&s;ibly alienated from GOD, and my whole &s;oul was overwhelmed in guilt and darkne&s;s, and during
<PB N="4" REF="024164_0004_0FC3DFA2240FFAB8">
the time of my per&s;i&s;ting to join with young com|pany in what is termed civil recreation and merri|ment, I felt tho&s;e la&s;hes and &s;tings of con&s;cience, which before this I had ever been an utter &s;tranger to. In this &s;tate of &s;en&s;ible guilt and darkne&s;s, I continued like one for&s;aken of GOD, and &s;hut out from his pre&s;ence, till the fir&s;t day of la&s;t July, when I was &s;eized with convul&s;ions, which came upon me with &s;uch violence, that it appeared to my&s;elf and others, that my animal frame mu&s;t &s;oon yield to the force of the di&s;order, and my life &s;oon come to a period.</P>
<P>She continued in this &s;ituation till the night of the 11th of July, when &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent cramp in her &s;tomach, which was ac|companied with &s;uch agony and di&s;tre&s;s, that it ap|peared impo&s;&s;ible for her to live from one hour to another. In this &s;ituation &s;he continued till the following night, when the cramp in her &s;tomach in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that the con&s;tant wreck and agony of body cnn&s;trained her to a continual rolling and tumbling on her bed, during which time &s;he remained &s;peechle&s;s, but appeared to have her &s;en&s;es; for when any &s;poke, &s;he would take them by the hand, and intimate that &s;he under&s;tood what they &s;aid. All hopes of life were now at an end in the view of the family, and neighbours, who had come together at the hou&s;e on this occa&s;ion. But after having continued in this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s till about midnight, &s;he appeared to be more ea&s;y, upon which the neighbours retired to their &s;everal homes. But &s;oon after this &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized again, and &s;uppo&s;ed by the family to be dead; and accord|ingly the neighbours were called together to the hou&s;e, with the tidings that POLLY was dead. Up|on the arrival of the neare&s;t neighbour, he ob&s;erved

that &s;he lay &s;tretched out on her back, with her eyes about half open, and the &s;ight of her eye turned up into her head. She appeared at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> en|tirely lifele&s;s; but upon trial, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ome motion in her pul&s;e. After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> for an hour or more, &s;he &s;udden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;igh, and opened her eyes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">:</P>
<P>I have &s;een hell naked before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> expected to plunge into it. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> beyond all de&s;cription. It was a region of mo&s;t di&s;|mal darkne&s;s and &s;moke. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e doleful &s;hades, appeared to my view a per&s;on whom I knew; and after having had a &s;ight of him, he ap|peared to &s;ink down into the darkne&s;s and &s;moke of the horrible pit. I heard the groans of the damned &s;pirits, which indicated that agony and di&s;tre&s;s which is beyond all utterance or conception. In the utmo&s;t extremity of danger, and when I appeared to my&s;elf to be ready to plunge into the di&s;mal gulf of dark|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery, my Saviour took me by the hand, and told me to follow him. Upon which he led me through a place re&s;embling the mo&s;t di&s;mal miry clay; and from thence through a hideous wilderne&s;s, after pa&s;&s;ing which every object which opened to my view appeared to be cloathed with an inexpre&s;&s;ible beauty. My Saviour addre&s;&s;ed me, and &s;aid, he had brought my feet out of the miry clay, and had &s;et them upon a rock; and he him&s;elf appeared to be the rock upon which my feet &s;tood. I was admit|ted into the heavenly world, where the Lord looked upon me and &s;miled, and told me I mu&s;t return and warn a wicked world for a little &s;ea&s;on; but &s;hould, in a &s;hort time return again. He told me I &s;hould be much more &s;ick than I had been, but &s;hould wholly recover and be well for a &s;ea&s;on, I &s;aw thou|&s;ands of the heavenly ho&s;t cloathed in that beauty
<PB N="6" REF="024164_0006_0FC3DFA795051698">
which cannot be uttered; and heard tho&s;e &s;ongs of prai&s;e, the melody of which is beyond the power of language to de&s;cribe</P>
<P>Upon her having declared to the by&s;tanders the&s;e di&s;coveries, &s;he remained for the &s;pace of three days and three nights without food or &s;leep during the whole of which time &s;he was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly em|ployed in praying and, prai&s;ing GOD, and warning others to prepare for death. After this &s;he gradu|ally recovered to &s;uch a degree of health, as to be able to walk about the hou&s;e; and, at times, to walk abroad. In this &s;pace &s;he frequently &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould be much &s;icker than ever &s;he had been; but &s;hould certainly reeover to a better &s;tate of health than &s;he had enjoyed for four years pa&s;t, She fre|quently pointed out the week in which &s;he &s;hould be taken &s;ick, and reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of extreme weakne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s; and accordingly on Friday of the &s;ame week &s;he had mentioned, (which was the 27th of July) &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent cramp convul&s;ion, which was &s;oon accom|panied with a profu&s;e di&s;charge of blood from her &s;tomach; in which &s;ituation &s;he continued, till the 13th of Augu&s;t; during which time &s;he was reduced apparently to the la&s;t extremity, and all vi&s;ible pro&s;|pect of the po&s;&s;ibility of her living was now at an end.</P>
<P>For the &s;pace of &s;ixteen days &s;he was not known to turn her&s;elf in the bed, except once. From Mon|day night to the Saturday night following, &s;he re|mained entirely without food or drink, except for once &s;he took down a little water; and upon her having for once &s;wallowed a mor&s;el of food, her &s;to|mach immediately rejected it. She was &s;o weak, that it was with difficulty, and very &s;eldom, &s;he could make any one under&s;tand her by whi&s;pering in their

ear. On Saturday &s;he was thought to be dying; but as &s;he had all along intimated to tho&s;e about her that &s;he &s;hould certainly recover, &s;o &s;he now con|tinued to intimate the &s;ame, by &s;igns, to the by|&s;tanders. In this &s;ituation &s;he continued till about eight o'clock, in the evening; at which time, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the by&s;tanders, &s;he &s;poke out in plain and audible words, and &s;aid, "Stand by, and let me get up" Immediately upon which &s;he &s;prang up from her bed, and walked the room with an a&s;toni&s;hing nimblene&s;s and alacrity, prai&s;ing God, and calling on the by&s;tanders to join with her, to prai&s;e that ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who had appeared for her in that won|derful manner. But they &s;tood like per&s;ons over|whelmed In a&s;toni&s;hment, to &s;ee the wonders of GOD'S power di&s;played in &s;uch a manner, in re&s;tor|ing one to health and &s;trength in a moment, who had been reduced to &s;o low a &s;tate by extreme &s;ick|ne&s;s. Upon this recovery, &s;he related that &s;he &s;aw one &s;tanding in white, who &s;aid to her, "If you will get up, you &s;hall be able to walk; and you mu&s;t go up to SCOTT'S;" (which was one mile di&s;tant from her hou&s;e) and accordingly that evening &s;he rode to Capt. SCOTT'S and tarried &s;ome hours, and return|ed home; and having retired to bed a little after day|break, &s;he aro&s;e early on the morning, and before &s;un-ri&s;e was on her way to meeting at <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> to the di&s;tance of five miles; from whence &s;he returned home on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>From the time of her recovery, &s;he has enjoyed hitherto a much better &s;tate of health, than for four years pa&s;t; and is now as well as is u&s;ual for a female of a delicate con&s;titution; and remains an evident monument of the Divine Power and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The above mentioned POLLY DAVIS reque&s;ts that her mo&s;t affectionate love may be pre&s;ented to every

reader; and a&s;ks leave to te&s;tify, "That a &s;en&s;e of GOD'S love in the heart is better than wine: and that all things which can be de&s;ired, are not to be compared to it. Under a &s;en&s;e of this, &s;he a&s;ks liberty to call upon every reader to come and ta&s;te that the LORD is gracious; and that her fellow youth, in &s;peical, would remember him in their early days, and regard his glory as their governing object. She does in|treat them, in &s;pecial, to for&s;ake the vanities of the world and pride of life: And if they would walk with GOD, &s;o as to enjoy the light of his countenance, and have comfort in their &s;ouls, they do &s;acredly ab&s;tain from, and forever abandon, that kind of fooli&s;h talking and je&s;ting, and that recreation and merriment, which generally pa&s;&s;es, even among&s;t many profe&s;&s;ors of religion, for <HI>civil and innocent.</HI>&mdash; She certainly knows, by what &s;he has found upon trial, that the&s;e things, in their operation, will be like wormwood and gall to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Under a &s;en&s;e that we are called with an high and holy calling, &s;he affectionately intreats every one to con&s;ider, what manner of per&s;ons we ought to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s; looking for, and ha&s;tening unto the day of GOD, that we may be found of him in peace at his appearing, and finally be received into his eternal kingdom.</P>
