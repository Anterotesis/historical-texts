<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE AGRICULTURE, MANUFACTURES, AND COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ible that in communicating my &s;en|timents on the policy of the United States, I ex|po&s;e my&s;elf to the cen&s;ure of many; particularly tho&s;e who are appointed by the people to &s;uperintend the political intere&s;t of the nation. This idea forcibly &s;trikes my mind. I &s;ee the impropriety of wandering out of the road which Providence hath a&s;&s;igned me, and &s;tepping into that allotted to more con&s;picuous characters. I feel my&s;elf al&s;o inadequate to the ta&s;k of writing judiciou&s;ly on the &s;ubject, and I already an|ticipate the mortification of finding my views and performance reprobated.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e forbidding circum&s;tances, I have determined to communicate my reflections on this &s;ubject, and that for the following rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, Becau&s;e the welfare of the United States ever hath been and now is an object of my warme&s;t wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, which has produced an irre&s;i&s;table inclina|tion to contribute every thing in my power to promote &s;o great and important an end. 2d, Becau&s;e, altho' all men are not warranted in taking upon them&s;elves the office of dictators, or powers of legi&s;lation; yet,
<PB N="4" REF="021774_0003_0FB59D750FB6B868">they are encouraged by the general con&s;ent of the people, and by the mo&s;t liberal and judicious maxims, to contribute to the general welfare of the nation, by an unre&s;trained communication of &s;entiments and ob|&s;ervations. Such an encouragement, which in &s;ome re&s;pects is peculiar to this country, I look upon as e&s;&s;ential to its political intere&s;t and happine&s;s; be|cau&s;e it &s;upports a general &s;pirit of enquiry and ob&s;er|vation among the people, by which means they ac|quire &s;uch a degree of political knowledge, as to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between proper and improper mea&s;ures of government&mdash;to di&s;cover errors and pro|po&s;e remedies&mdash;to be &s;ea&s;onably alarmed on ju&s;t oc|ca&s;ions, and to be &s;atisfied under a wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration. 3d, Becau&s;e the intere&s;t and happi|ne&s;s of the citizens of the United States will be influ|enced and immediately affected by the &s;y&s;tem of reve|nue and commerce which the national legi&s;lature may form and e&s;tabli&s;h; and, as I apprehend, the &s;ubject when brought into con&s;ideration will be found involv|ed in many difficulties; &s;o, I flatter my&s;elf, that the communication of &s;uch remarks and ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject as are founded in truth and rea&s;on, and written with decency and mode&s;ty, will be noticed according to their merit. If tho&s;e gentlemen who have made the political intere&s;t of the United States a &s;ubject of reflection and ob&s;ervation, would com|municate their re&s;ult, it appears to me that much ad|vantage might be derived therefrom. It would tend, I conceive, to the forming a &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce in a greater degree of perfection; for, al|though it is to be pre&s;umed that the general Congre&s;s will be compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t enlightened men in the &s;tates, and I tru&s;t, I may add, the mo&s;t patriotic, yet, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that infinite knowledge or in|fallible mea&s;ures will di&s;tingui&s;h that from all other public bodies of men. Even this body, I conceive, may draw information from a variety of quarters, and
<PB N="5" REF="021774_0004_0FB59D77FB8CCFE0">knowledge from many &s;ources. 4th, Becau&s;e, not|with&s;tanding I entertain no vain idea of my own &s;aga|city or abilities, yet, as light may &s;pring up out of darkne&s;s, and a &s;park be &s;truck from a very unpoli&s;hed material; &s;o I am encouraged to proceed from a con|&s;ideration of the po&s;&s;ibility of my &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome|thing, which, in the hands of wi&s;e and judicious men, may be improved to advantage. And 5th, I am the more encouraged to this communication from a further con&s;ideration, that in addre&s;&s;ing you in particular, I have nothing to fear, being confident that the be&s;t and mo&s;t proper u&s;e will be made of it. From the &s;hort time in which I have had the honor, as well as the plea&s;ure of being known to you, I am convinced your &s;entiments and wi&s;hes re&s;pecting the welfare and pro&s;perity of the United States, are congenial with my own: You will therefore, I doubt not, put a libe|ral con&s;truction on my views, and treat the perform|ance with candor. If you find nothing here worthy of notice, you will not improve it to my di&s;advantage; if any thing capable of improvement, you will make the be&s;t u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the compo&s;ition, I could a&s;&s;ign ma|ny rea&s;ons as an apology for the numberle&s;s defects which you will di&s;cover, but &s;hall omit them: You are probably acquainted with &s;ome of them, and will for that rea&s;on, I hope, treat the imperfections of the piece with the tenderne&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P>Without further explanation or apology, therefore, I will proceed to give you the re&s;ult of my reflections on the political intere&s;t of the United States, and &s;ome of the mea&s;ures which to me appear nece&s;&s;ary to promote and &s;ecure their welfare; in doing of which I aim at proceeding on original principles, without entangling my mind with the &s;y&s;tems and maxims of other nations.</P>
<P>As it is with individuals, &s;o it is with nations in their connections and tran&s;actions with one another;
<PB N="6" REF="021774_0005_0FB59D7D26C3F728">the acqui&s;ition of property or accumulation of wealth is a grand and principal object; for on the wealth of a nation does its &s;ecurity and the temporal felicity of the people in a great mea&s;ure depend; and the &s;ame mea&s;ures which an individual doth or ought to take for the accumulation of wealth &s;hould be pur&s;ued by a nation. In both ca&s;es, a dependence on their own re&s;ources, and the be&s;t improvement of the natural advantages which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s, is that alone by which either can hope or expect to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>De&s;pots who have held nations in va&s;&s;alage, altho' their avarice has been in&s;atiable, have very often over|looked that which would the neare&s;t have come up to their views. They have drained their &s;ubjects of their money by oppre&s;&s;ion; have reduced them to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, and at the &s;ame time neglected the mo&s;t proper and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to have put them into and kept them in a flouri&s;hing condition. By this means they have, at times, filled a trea&s;ury; but at the expence of tho&s;e re&s;ources and advantages where|by a trea&s;ury might be repleni&s;hed from time to time, as occa&s;ions required.</P>
<P>This I conceive always hath been, and always will be the ca&s;e, more or le&s;s, where the views and intere&s;t of the government, and tho&s;e of the people at large, are con&s;idered in any degree or re&s;pect different and independent of one another. But in free governments, where the views of the legi&s;lature and of admini&s;tra|tion, the intere&s;t of the public, and the intere&s;t and views of individuals are con&s;idered the &s;ame, the mea|&s;ures of government do, or ought to aim at the in|crea&s;e of the wealth of the people, rather than at the drawing their property into the public trea&s;ury; be|cau&s;e, by increa&s;ing the riches of the people, or by laying a &s;uitable foundation for a con&s;tant accumula|tion of wealth, an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource is provided for national purpo&s;es, which can always be applied to as occa&s;ions may require, without rendering public demands oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021774_0006_0FB59D8039CBDE30">
The fir&s;t object therefore to be had in view by government in its &s;y&s;tem of policy, as it particularly re&s;pects property, is, I conceive, the increa&s;e of the wealth of the people.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, I would ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That there are certain re&s;ources and natural advantages which all nations are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and certain ways and means by which they may increa&s;e their wealth, and in proportion to tho&s;e re|&s;ources and advantages may their wealth be increa&s;|ed; but the actual increa&s;e of wealth depends on the manner of improvement. A nation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every advantage which it is in the power of nature to endow it with, may neverthele&s;s be embarra&s;&s;ed, poor and dependent; and a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing but few natural advantages, may, by wi&s;e and prudent mea|&s;ures, joined with indu&s;try and enterpri&s;e, become independent and even opulent. Exemplary in&s;tances in proof hereof might be adduced. It is therefore, by a judicious improvement of the re&s;ources and natural advantages which the United States po&s;&s;e&s;s, that they can expect to become opulent or truly in|dependent.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> By agriculture, manufactures and commerce, the re&s;ources and advantages of a country are im|proved, and applied in the fir&s;t place, to the furni&s;h|ing the people with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and conveniencies of life; and in the next, to the ac|qui&s;ition of property or accumulation of wealth. But as the&s;e in their operation and influence may counteract one another and de&s;troy their ultimate intention, it remains with the government or legi&s;|lative authority of the nation, on whom its welfare depends, to confine the&s;e general and common inter|e&s;ts, in their operation, in &s;uch a manner, as that they may co-operate to an&s;wer the end for which they are de&s;igned, viz. To promote the general welfare of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021774_0007_0FB59D81071D6558">
<HI>Third.</HI> If the riches of a nation may be increa&s;ed inproportion to its natural advantages and re&s;ources, which cannot be di&s;puted, then it may be ration|ally concluded, that the United States may become more opulent than any other nation; becau&s;e the re&s;ources and advantages which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, are greater and more various than any other nation enjoys. The diver&s;ity of climate and &s;oil within the limits of the United States, are adapted to the greate&s;t variety of vegetable and animal production of any nation whatever. The earth abounds with the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary minerals, and the &s;ea furni&s;hes a great variety and plenty of fi&s;h. They have the advantage of an exten&s;ive &s;ea coa&s;t, and no nation can boa&s;t of &s;uch inland &s;eas and water communica|tion as the United States.</P>
<P>This country has all the means within it&s;elf of furni&s;hing every nece&s;&s;ary, convenience and luxury of life, and of carrying on an exten&s;ive foreign and dome&s;tic commerce; con&s;equently it hath every thing which nature can be&s;tow, to render it opulent and powerful, and the people ea&s;y and happy in their circum&s;tances. All that is wanting to produce the&s;e effects is to improve the advantages of the coun|try in the be&s;t manner and to the mo&s;t valuable pur|po&s;es; to encourage indu&s;try and the u&s;eful arts, and by a judicious &s;y&s;tem of commerce, &s;o to encourage, protect and regulate the agricultural, manufacturing and commercial intere&s;ts in their various branches and departments, as to render them mutually &s;ub|&s;ervient to the general weal.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of my de&s;ign, I &s;hall confine my ob&s;ervations generally to agriculture, manufac|tures and commerce, and attempt to &s;hew &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential advantages which are to be de|rived therefrom; the influence which they recipro|cally have on each other; the embarra&s;&s;ments they are now under; the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to remove
<PB N="9" REF="021774_0008_0FB59D828AA59600">the impediments in the way of their advancement and pro&s;perity; and in &s;hort, a brief &s;ketch of that general plan of regulations which appear to me ne|ce&s;&s;ary and proper to advance the wealth and power of the United States, by rendering their agriculture, manufactures and commerce mutually &s;ub&s;ervient thereunto. And as it will be impo&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider the&s;e as fully as will be nece&s;&s;ary, without embra|cing in the idea a national revenue, &s;o far as it is founded on, and derived from commerce, &s;hall con|&s;ider them in connection with each other. But be|fore I enter on the&s;e, I would introduce two or three prefatory ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It is a matter which ought to be impre&s;&s;ed on the mind of every one, that in any general regu|lations which may be adopted by the national legi&s;la|ture relative to the general intere&s;ts of the people, it is impo&s;&s;ible equally to regard the intere&s;t of every individual; and indeed in &s;ome in&s;tances it would be improper; becau&s;e the private intere&s;t of individuals, is very often directly oppo&s;ed to the general intere&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of the public, or that which is the be&s;t calculated to promote the common intere&s;t of the nation, is undoubtedly to be regarded in prefer|ence to the partial intere&s;t of any of its parts, or the private intere&s;t of any individual, and that for this rea&s;on; becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to increa&s;e the wealth of a nation, let it come in by what door or through who&s;e hands it will; or let it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance benefit whom, or whatever particular parts of the nation it may, without its having a proper influence and effect on every individual, either di|rectly or in a more indirect manner. And &s;o on the other hand, the wealth of a nation cannot be dimini&s;hed, let it be through who&s;e hands it will, without its affecting every individual in the nation. The detached parts of the United States, as well as
<PB N="10" REF="021774_0009_0FB59D8442CC56D0">individuals, ought therefore, and undoubtedly they will be convinced, that the &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce, which the national government may form and e&s;tabli&s;h, having for its object the general intere&s;t and welfare of the &s;tates, &s;hould meet with the approbation and &s;upport of the people, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome may be more directly and immediately benefited than others.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> But, notwith&s;tanding this, as the United States are in &s;ome particulars differently circum&s;tanced with re&s;pect to their intere&s;ts, from the people of any other nation, a &s;pirit of accommodation, I conceive, ought to run through the general regulations of trade. But &s;uch accommodations ought not to be without li|mits. They ought not to be &s;o calculated as to keep the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal &s;tates different, and forever &s;eparate and di&s;tinct; but rather, by &s;ome ea&s;y and eligible mode in the change of their commercial in|tere&s;ts and connections, eventually con&s;olidate, and render them the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the &s;ame regulations of trade which would be mo&s;t advantageous to the northern &s;tates, might injure the intere&s;ts of the &s;outhern &s;tates; for in&s;tance, it would be to the advantage of the northern &s;tates, if the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be wholly con|fined to the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, becau&s;e they have ve&s;&s;els and &s;eamen &s;ufficient to freight the whole of their productions to market; but this is not the ca&s;e with the &s;outhern &s;tates; they have neither ve&s;&s;els nor &s;eamen &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, and this deficiency the northern &s;tates are not at this time able fully to &s;upply. Had the northern &s;tates ve&s;&s;els and &s;eamen &s;ufficient to &s;erve the intere&s;t of the &s;outhern &s;tates in their freighting bu&s;ine&s;s, they ought by a general regulation to have a preference: But as they have not at pre&s;ent, as they might at this time be much more improved than they are, and as in a &s;hort time they might increa&s;e their navigation in &s;uch
<PB N="11" REF="021774_0010_0FB59D8D08324C10">a manner as to freight the produce of the &s;outhern &s;tates, &s;hould the &s;outhern &s;tates neglect to increa&s;e their navigation, and &s;till depend on foreign ve&s;&s;els, I apprehend that the regulations of trade re&s;pecting the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign ve&s;&s;els in the commerce of the United States, ought to be adapted to the circum|&s;tances of the &s;outhern &s;tates; but in &s;uch a manner, that a preference of &s;ome kind be eventually &s;ecured to the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, either by an impo|&s;ition of duties on foreign ve&s;&s;els, or by cutting off the original cau&s;es of the preference which has been given to them in the commerce of the States. Again,</P>
<P>The northern &s;tates are able to furni&s;h their ve&s;&s;els with a full complement of &s;eamen; the &s;outhern &s;tates are not, and probably the northern &s;tates are not able to &s;upply this deficiency, for which rea&s;on I conceive, that the laws of navigation in this parti|cular, &s;hould be adapted to the circum&s;tances of the &s;outhern &s;tates, and admit of a greater proportion of foreign &s;eamen in the navigation of American ve&s;&s;els, than would be proper, were all the &s;tates able to fur|ni&s;h a full proportion. The northern &s;tates would employ American &s;eamen none the le&s;s, on account of &s;uch an indulgence; and as the proportion which may probably be fixed, will oblige the &s;outhern &s;tates to give greater encouragement and &s;upport to Ame|rican &s;eamen than they have heretofore done, it will be the means of producing at la&s;t a &s;ufficient number of American &s;eamen, to give a full comple|ment throughout the &s;tates to their navigation. Again,</P>
<P>It would be to the intere&s;t of the northern &s;tates, totally to prohibit the importation of many articles of produce and manufacture; becau&s;e they do, or might furni&s;h them &s;ufficiently for their own u&s;e; and becau&s;e they do produce and manufacture many articles in &s;ufficient quantities for the u&s;e of all the &s;tates. In the regulations of trade therefore re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="12" REF="021774_0011_0FB59D909326F440">importations, I conceive many articles of pro|duce and manufacture &s;hould be prohibited from foreign nations <HI>throughout</HI> the &s;tates, and others pro|hibited in the northern &s;tates, which may be found nece&s;&s;ary to be admitted in the &s;outhern &s;tates, for perhaps a limited time. But at the &s;ame time &s;ub|ject to &s;uch a duty as would give &s;upport and en|couragement to American manufactures, throughout all the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Some accommodations of the nature of tho&s;e here &s;ugge&s;ted, I apprehend, might take place in the general regulations, much to the pre&s;ent advantage of particular &s;tates, without creating any new di&s;|advantages to the general intere&s;t, as the &s;tates are now circum&s;tanced.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> As the &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce will have a direct and immediate influence on the property and intere&s;ts of the people, it &s;hould have certain objects in view, be&s;ides the drawing of money into the national trea&s;ury. I always had an objec|tion in my own mind, to the five per cent impo&s;t on this account. It appeared to have nothing further in view than a revenue; whereas, as I apprehend, a &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce in its con&s;truction, ought to aim, 1&s;t. At accommodating the intere&s;ts of agriculture, manufactures and commerce in &s;uch a manner, as to render them reciprocally a &s;upport to each other, and mutually beneficial to the intere&s;t of the nation. 2d. It &s;hould aim at &s;ecuring to the people the advantages and emoluments of every occu|pation, bu&s;ine&s;s and employment, in which they are &s;everally engaged, not repugnant to the general wel|fare, by preventing rivalries. 3d. It &s;hould aim at preventing a too general and profu&s;e a u&s;e of luxu|rious and frivolous articles of merchandize, where|by the ta&s;te of the people becomes vitiated, their morals corrupted, and the valuable property of the country drawn out of it for things of no real worth.
<PB N="13" REF="021774_0012_0FB59D9190A30C68">4th. It &s;hould aim at drawing money from the rich and opulent, for public &s;ervices in &s;uch ways and by &s;uch methods, as their own choice and approbation may concur therein; and in this way, 5th. To ea&s;e the burdens of the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people; and 6th. If there is not circulating money in the &s;tates to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the public, as well as of individuals, one great object to be aimed at in a &s;y&s;tem of commerce, is the increa&s;e of money.</P>
<P>In the further treatment of the &s;ubject, I &s;hall not aim at &s;y&s;tem, but communicate my ideas in de&s;ul|tory ob&s;ervations, under the general divi&s;ions of AGRICULTURE, MANUFACTURES and COMMERCE.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>AGRICULTURE is the original &s;ource, from whence the people derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, comforts and conveniencies, and the foundation of the commerce and wealth of a nation. By cultivating and improving the face of a country, its real value is augmented; by the productions of the field, the people &s;ub&s;i&s;t and enjoy life; by furni&s;hing the manufacturer and arti|zan with materials for fabrication, provi&s;ion is made for the &s;upport of an increa&s;ed number of inhabi|tants, and the people thereby &s;upplied with their conveniencies; and on agriculture does commerce de|pend, as its original &s;upport. Agriculture &s;hould therefore be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tant intere&s;t of a nation, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful and ho|norable of all profe&s;&s;ions. And for the encourage|ment and &s;upport of the agricultural intere&s;t of the United States, I would &s;ugge&s;t the following parti|culars. 1&s;t. Every article which is produced in the
<PB N="14" REF="021774_0013_0FB59D94678245E8">United States &s;hould be prohibited from other nations. Beef, butter, chee&s;e, indigo and iron, are the natural productions of this country, and produced in &s;uffici|ent quantities for the u&s;e of the people throughout the &s;tates, and for that rea&s;on ought to be prohibited. Neverthele&s;s, beef and butter are imported from Ire|land, chee&s;e from England, iron frequently from Sweden, and indigo from the We&s;t-Indies, mani|fe&s;tly prejudicial to the agricultural intere&s;t of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tification of the practice of importing the&s;e articles from abroad, it is &s;aid that they are of a &s;u|perior quality. To this I would ob&s;erve, that altho' &s;ome preference on this account might be given to tho&s;e articles of foreign production, yet, &s;uch of them as are articles of con&s;umption, and produced in this country, are of a quality &s;ufficiently good to &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable ta&s;te. The others are of a quality of &s;ufficient goodne&s;s to an&s;wer all the nece&s;&s;ary pur|po&s;es required of them; but even if they were not, they might be improved to any degree of perfection. All the productions of the United States might be &s;o improved as to render them equally good with the pro|ductions of other countries, and no doubt would be, were &s;uitable encouragement given.</P>
<P>It is, I conceive, by the encouragement of having a certain market &s;ecured, and a price adequate to the goodne&s;s of commodities, that people are induced to make improvements. It tends to excite a &s;pirit of emulation among them, and whenever that is properly excited, it will render the productions of America in the highe&s;t degree excellent in quality; for there is no natural or other in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle in the way of it.</P>
<P>A prohibition therefore on the importation of the&s;e articles from abroad, I conceive, would be proper, and a means of encouraging and &s;upporting the agri|cultural intere&s;t of the United States.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="021774_0014_0FB59D9547C10BE0">
2d. Such articles as are not, but that <HI>might be</HI> produced in &s;ufficient quantities for the u&s;e and &s;er|vices of the people, &s;hould be encouraged by duties laid on the like articles imported from abroad; or by bounties, or both, as circum&s;tances may require and render mo&s;t advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>There are three articles which come within this de&s;cription, and which I have ever thought to be of important con&s;ideration. The&s;e are &s;ilk, hemp and wine; all of which I conceive might be produced in this country to any requi&s;ite quantity.</P>
<P>By the experiments which have been made, it is found that &s;ilk may be cultivated in all, even the northern &s;tates, and that to the <HI>greate&s;t advantage;</HI> particularly in the&s;e re&s;pects: 1&s;t. It doth not in|terfere with the intere&s;t or common bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;|bandry. Mulberry trees may be planted in &s;uch lands, and in &s;uch a manner, as not to interfere with or preju|dice any other production; and children who are not capable of working in the field, may take care of the worms in every &s;tage of their exi&s;tence. 2d. The time required to attend to the feeding of the worms is but trifling, compared with any other kind of agricul|tural bu&s;ine&s;s. Six weeks is &s;ufficient to bring the production to maturity, and the nece&s;&s;ary employment of that time, children will always con&s;ider not a di&s;|gu&s;tful &s;ervice, but an agreeable amu&s;ement. And 3d. It is the mo&s;t productive. Five or &s;ix children, with the advantage of a mulberry orchard, might produce &s;ilk &s;ufficient to clothe a family, with more ea&s;e than a family, with its common advantages, could produce wool and flax enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Without dimini&s;hing any of the u&s;ual productions of the field, the culture of &s;ilk might very &s;oon be increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree in the United States, as to enable them to export manufactured &s;ilk in quantities equal to their pre&s;ent importations.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021774_0015_0FB59D9BDC44B1C0">
<HI>All</HI> the &s;tates have more or le&s;s lands &s;uitable for the cultivation of hemp; but the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates have abundance which might be improved in this culture to better advantage than in any other; and when we con&s;ider the annual large importations of hemp, cordage and &s;ail-cloth, together with the in|crea&s;ing demand of the&s;e articles, by an increa&s;ing navigation, and a &s;till farther increa&s;e in the demand, in con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a navy, which will probably take place in &s;ome &s;hort time, the impor|tance of the culture of hemp mu&s;t forcibly &s;trike the attention of every man.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the production of wine, it may be ob&s;erved, that there is no country who&s;e cli|mate and &s;oil are better adapted to the cultivation of grapes, than the &s;outhern &s;tates, and none under better advantages to carry it to a great extent.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible that the population of this part of the country, and the con&s;equent productions of their pre&s;ent &s;taple commodities, will, in &s;ome &s;hort time, outrun a profitable demand for them. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, to what could they turn their attention with more &s;ure pro&s;pects of advantage to the public, and profit to them&s;elves, than making of wine? This is an article which cannot well be overdone; for the demand for wine is daily increa&s;ing in this country, and many other countries are dependent, and always will be, for the wines which they con&s;ume: So that the &s;outhern &s;tates would have no rea&s;on to apprehend a failure and di&s;appointment, let their exertions be ever &s;o great in the cultivation of grapes, and pro|duction of wines.</P>
<P>The advantages which this country would derive from the cultivation of the&s;e articles, are many and important&mdash;of &s;uch magnitude as to demand the at|tention of every well-wi&s;her to the intere&s;t of the country, and the particular con&s;ideration of the Nation|al Legi&s;lature; and, as the culture of the&s;e lies out of
<PB N="17" REF="021774_0016_0FB59D9D17DC5660">the common road of hu&s;bandry in this country, and the be&s;t methods of management, are perhaps not well under&s;tood, I apprehend, to charge a duty on the like articles imported from foreign nations, with a view of giving a preference in market to our own productions, would not be &s;ufficient to introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h them. It therefore appears to me, that pre|miums might be propo&s;ed with propriety, and a good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s and public advantage.</P>
<P>The particular mode of offering premiums, which I apprehend would be the mo&s;t likely to produce a proper effect, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t con|formable to the circum&s;tances of the United States, is as follows, viz. For the greate&s;t quantity and be&s;t quality of hemp, produced by any one per&s;on or company, in either of the United States, in any one year, within twenty years, one thou&s;and pounds, for the &s;econd greate&s;t quantity and be&s;t quality, five hundred pounds, for the third, &amp;c. two hundred pounds, and for the fourth, one hundred pounds; and the &s;ame for &s;ilk and for wine, made from foreign grapes cultivated in the States.</P>
<P>Premiums of this amount would excite a &s;pirit of emulation and rivalry among the people, the length of time would be &s;ufficient to make every nece&s;&s;ary experiment and improvement, and not too long for that purpo&s;e, and by that time the public will proba|bly be able to pay &s;uch premiums. In the mean time al&s;o, the public would be doubly advantaged by the quantities, by that time already produced, and &s;till more &s;o by the quantities which would &s;ucceed, for the cultivation of the&s;e being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, would never be &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P N="3">3d. For the further encouragement and &s;upport of the agricultural intere&s;t, good and &s;afe markets for the productions of the country &s;hould be &s;ecured by treaties of commerce, and by the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures in the power of the States to promote and protect their trade.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="021774_0017_0FB59D9FD66AD0B8">
Congre&s;s hitherto has not been unmindful of this, and probably all that could be done under the poli|tical embarra&s;&s;ments of the States, hath been done; but it is hoped and expected, the pre&s;ent national government can do &s;omething more for the advance|ment of commerce.</P>
<P>Agreeably however to the be&s;t political maxims, a market at home for the productions of the field, ought to be &s;ought in preference to one abroad, which are undoubtedly founded in rea&s;on and good policy; becau&s;e it pre&s;uppo&s;es that in doing this a nation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e its arti&s;ans and la|bourers, from whence are derived many additional public advantages.</P>

<HEAD>MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE public advantages derived from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of manufactures, are greater in &s;ome re&s;|pects than can be derived from agriculture or com|merce, particularly as manufactures are more imme|diately and directly productive of wealth. The va|rious articles of manufacture made u&s;e of by a people, amount to a much greater &s;um than tho&s;e of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, including every luxury; con&s;equently were a nation &s;o circum&s;tanced as to be obliged to make a choice, it would be found more advantageous to at|tend to its manufactures, and depend on other na|tions for its means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than to &s;upply it|&s;elf with the&s;e and depend on other nations for its manufactures.</P>
<P>An agricultural nation which exports its raw ma|terials, and imports its manufactures, never can be opulent, becau&s;e every profitable advantage which can be derived from its productions is given into the
<PB N="19" REF="021774_0018_0FB59DA250FC3C70">hands of the manufacturing nation.&mdash;The amount of the profitable advantages thus given away, can|not perhaps be preci&s;ely a&s;certained; but if we con|&s;ider the u&s;ual prices of the raw materials and the price of the general run of manufactures, we &s;hall find that there is at lea&s;t a difference of three hundred per cent. The benefit therefore, of three hundred pounds on every one hundred pound, is given away by, and lo&s;t to that nation which exports its natural productions and imports its manufactures.</P>
<P>Neither can an agricultural nation become power|ful, and that for this one plain rea&s;on, (without de|&s;cending to a minute con&s;ideration) the means of &s;upport is, by importing its manufactures drawn out of the nation. This benefit of three hundred pounds on one hundred pounds, goes to the &s;upport of the in|habitants of the manufacturing nation, and by that an importing nation deprives it&s;elf of the advantage of increa&s;ing its inhabitants, in a proportion equal to the means of &s;upport thus drawn away.</P>
<P><HI>Connecticut</HI> is perhaps the be&s;t populated State in the Union, but it has arrived at its <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> On its pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, it will never be capable of &s;upporting a greater number of inhabitants than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hath done for many years back.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, if that State &s;hould add manufactures to its agricul|ture,&mdash;&s;upport a commerce on its improvements,&mdash; make returns in productive commodities, and on the whole, apply its natural re&s;ources in the mo&s;t judi|cious manner to the &s;upport of its inhabitants, it might as ea&s;ily &s;upport eight hundred thou&s;and, as it doth now about two hundred thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>Some countries are &s;o circum&s;tanced as not to he capable of manufacturing;&mdash;they have neither the materials or conveniencies;&mdash;to &s;ome of whom na|ture has been &s;o bountiful as to &s;upply the&s;e defi|ciencies with rich &s;taple productions; yet even &s;uch countries can never be independent, opulent or
<PB N="20" REF="021774_0019_0FB59DA7AD732990">powerful.&mdash;The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands is aproof of this; their lands are fertile and their pro|ductions valuable, yet they are dependent on other countries for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, the balance of their trade is again&s;t them, and they are incapable without foreign aid and &s;upport, to make a re&s;pecta|ble defence. And the &s;outhern States who&s;e climate and &s;oil are much in their favor, and who&s;e produc|tions are the mo&s;t valuable of any of the States, are neverthele&s;s dependent, embarra&s;&s;ed, and by no means populous. The northern States, in all the&s;e re&s;pects have a preference, notwith&s;tanding the unfavourable difference in their climate and foil.</P>
<P>That which will render a nation in the highe&s;t de|gree opulent, is, its &s;upplying and furni&s;hing it&s;elf, from its own re&s;ources, and by its own labor and arts, all its nece&s;&s;aries, and a &s;urplus for the &s;upport of commerce. The amount of this &s;urplus deter|mines the degree of wealth to which a nation may arrive.&mdash;A nation therefore like the United States, which does produce every nece&s;&s;ary article of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence in a great abundance, which might produce and furni&s;h all of the e&s;&s;ential materials for fabrica|tion and manufacture, and which might introduce and &s;upport every nece&s;&s;ary art, &s;hould undoubtedly have in view as its fir&s;t object, the &s;upplying it&s;elf with all its nece&s;&s;aries.&mdash;By this and by the &s;urplus productions which the United States will always have for the &s;upport of commerce, they may become per|haps the mo&s;t independent, opulent and powerful nation that ever was known; for their re&s;ources are equal to it, but by neglecting the u&s;eful arts, and con|tinuing in the habit of importing their manufac|tures, the States will remain dependent, impoveri&s;h|ed and embarra&s;&s;ed, let their re&s;ources and agricul|tural productions be what they will.</P>
<P>A nation in fact may produce all its nece&s;&s;ary ar|ticles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,&mdash;it may increa&s;e its real value by
<PB N="21" REF="021774_0020_0FB59DAC91278E48">cultivation and improvement,&mdash;it may carry on an exten&s;ive trade, and it may be remarkable for indu&s;|try; yet if it, at the &s;ame time depends on other na|tions for its manufactures, it will never increa&s;e its circulating property, and con&s;equently will &s;uffer all the inconveniences and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which re&s;ult from &s;traitened circum&s;tances.&mdash;The experience of this country &s;ufficiently proves and illu&s;trate this ob&s;er|vation, without entering into a train of rea&s;oning and remark.</P>
<P>As by a combination and mutual co-operation of the general intere&s;ts of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, the wealth and power of a nation is promoted; &s;o by the concurrence of a variety of ad|vantageous circum&s;tances, contained in the particu|lar intere&s;t of manufactures, the wealth and power of a nation receives more e&s;&s;ential and important &s;up|ports from this, than from either or both of the other general intere&s;ts, they being detached therefrom:&mdash; As 1&s;t, by manufactures the natural &s;trength of the nation is augmented. This I have ju&s;t mentioned be|fore, but I would beg leave to bring it into view again. A moment's reflection will convince us of the importance of manufactures, con&s;idering it in this point of light.&mdash;How many per&s;ons do the impor|tations of the United States &s;upport in foreign na|tions, who po&s;&s;ibly may take up arms one day or another again&s;t them? The number cannot be a&s;|certained with any degree of exactne&s;s, but it is &s;o great as to merit con&s;ideration; for whether the arms of the&s;e will ever in fact be employed again&s;t the States or not, it would undoubtedly be more prudent to &s;upport &s;o many citizens who would con|tribute to the national &s;afety and defence, than to &s;upport &s;o many foreigners, who&s;e &s;ervices could on no occa&s;ion be claimed.&mdash;2d. By manufactures the circulating property is not only increa&s;ed but retain|ed, which is as nece&s;&s;ary to the commercial life and
<PB N="22" REF="021774_0021_0FB59DAFB1665CC0">vigour of a nation, as the blood is to the life and vigour of animals. A &s;ufficient quantity (to pur&s;ue the &s;imile) will force its way to the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive ve&s;&s;el, giving it life and activity; while a deficiency in quantity will not only throw the ex|terior parts but the whole body into a langui&s;hing condition. 3d. By manufactures, the productions of the field, tho&s;e e&s;pecially which are &s;uitable for manufacturing, are rendered in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree valuable. Manufacturing adds three fourths of the value of manufactured articles; con&s;equently mu&s;t be con&s;idered a mo&s;t important improvement on the productions of the country, and a &s;ure and mo&s;t eligible means of augmenting the riches of a na|tion. 4th. By manufactures, a more profitable com|merce can be &s;upported, than by the natural produc|tions of the country. A cargo of manufactured mer|chandize is immen&s;ely more valuable, and of con&s;e|quence will make more advantageous returns than any cargoes the States can now export, except only the article of Indigo. 5th. By the &s;upport of manu|factures in the United States, returns in trade would be made, not as u&s;ually have been made, not in &s;uper|fluous and unprofitable merchandize, nor in arti|cles incapable of improvement, but in &s;omething really valuable,&mdash;&s;omething capable of improvement, &mdash;&s;omething productive and accumulating,&mdash;&s;ome|thing in &s;hort which will increa&s;e the wealth of the nation.</P>
<P>The manufacturing intere&s;t therefore, of the Uni|ted States, is I conceive of &s;uch importance, as to merit particular attention, and to excite the utmo&s;t exertions of every true friend to the country.</P>
<P>The enemies to the real intere&s;t of the United States, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e who regard their own private intere&s;t in preference to every other con&s;ideration, have ever &s;ugge&s;ted a number of objections to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures; as</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="021774_0022_0FB59DB107A6F430">
1&s;t. That we can always purcha&s;e goods cheaper than can be manufactured in the country. This as relates to individuals may in part be true, but as it relates to the public, is by no means a fact. An in|dividual may purcha&s;e foreign manufactured goods, probably for le&s;s money than this country could at at this time afford to manufacture, many articles particularly, but this &s;imple fact does by no means determine the matter in que&s;tion. The que&s;tion to be determined is not, <HI>which</HI> co&s;t mo&s;t money, the manufactures of Europe or the manufactures of A|merica; but whether the money thus laid out in the purcha&s;e of foreign goods, co&s;t the country more than would have co&s;t by manufacturing the goods them|&s;elves or not? To determine the que&s;tion ju&s;tly, there is no other rule but a calculation of the labour be&s;|towed on the foreign goods bought, and the labour expended on the produce of the country, which pro|cured the money that purcha&s;ed the goods; for the value of all productions mu&s;t be traced up to this original &s;tandard. If the que&s;tion be decided by this rule, which I think mu&s;t be admitted as the only ju&s;t one, then I conceive by two circum&s;tances it can be proved, that the United States pay much more for their nece&s;&s;ary manufactures by importing them, than they would do by manufacturing them&s;elves; that is, they expend more labour on their produce for market, than would be nece&s;&s;ary to expend on the manufactures which their produce purcha&s;es. The one is the balance of trade is greatly again&s;t them.&mdash;It is an indu&s;trious country and very produc|tive, yet after exporting all the avails of its labour annually, a balance remains again&s;t it; this I know is occa&s;ioned in part, by importing too many luxu|rious and &s;uperfluous articles, neverthele&s;s no country as indu&s;trious and productive as the United States, but would &s;upply it&s;elf with all its nece&s;&s;aries, and all the luxuries made u&s;e of by the people, be&s;ides
<PB N="24" REF="021774_0023_0FB59DB282D82640">leaving a con&s;iderable &s;urplus, if its labour was ap|plied in a direct manner to the &s;upplying it&s;elf, or did it receive an adequate return.</P>
<P>There is not more labour performed in Great-Bri|tain, according to the number of inhabitants, than in the United States, probably not as much; and as a large or larger &s;um in the &s;ame proportion is ex|pended there for luxuries and &s;uperfluities, yet, the balance of the trade of that nation is greatly in its favour, while that of the United States is greatly again&s;t them; for which I can a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on but that which I ju&s;t now mentioned, the labour performed in Great-Britain is well applied and re|ceives an adequate return; in the United States it is, and doth not.</P>
<P>The other circum&s;tance in proof of the point in que&s;tion is, that from ob&s;ervation and the be&s;t in|formation, we know of no article of American pro|duce &s;old in Europe, that neats twenty &s;hillings, which did not co&s;t more labour than the &s;ame amount of manufactures received there in return.&mdash;How much more cannot be preci&s;ely &s;tated, but if we were to &s;ay double, it would not perhaps exceed the truth.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;hew the rea&s;on why this country with all its fertility and indu&s;try, is never|thele&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and proves at the &s;ame time, that were the labour which is performed in the United States, applied to the production of the nece&s;&s;ary materials for manufacturing, and to manufacturing it&s;elf, it would be more publicly ad|vantageous, than to apply it to the production of cer|tain articles for foreign market, for the purpo&s;e of procuring their nece&s;&s;ary manufactures.</P>
<P>This objection however, let it have what weight it may, might be &s;oon removed, by &s;uitable encourage|ment and &s;upport given to manufactures, by being e&s;tabli&s;hed on good and &s;ufficient capitals, by being
<PB N="25" REF="021774_0024_0FB59DBF10925328">put under good regulations, by the increa&s;e of manu|factures, by habit and u&s;e in the manufacturing arts, and by the increa&s;e of the materials for manufactur|ing, the price of manufactures would &s;oon be reduced to a rea&s;onable &s;tandard, many articles cheaper than can be imported.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It hath frequently been mentioned by way of objection, that land being &s;o cheap and ea&s;y to be obtained, people dependent on their labour for &s;up|port, would &s;o generally go into hu&s;bandry as to render the &s;upport of manufactories in the United States impracticable; but I conceive this objection is not well founded.</P>
<P>Since the government is e&s;tabli&s;hing, and probably will finally be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a good and &s;afe footing, and manufactures patronized, many manufacturers will migrate into this country; the&s;e people will never go into hu&s;bandry; they under&s;tand nothing of it; their &s;ole object in coming into this country will be to enter into tho&s;e kinds of employment in which they have been educated and brought up, on a pro&s;|pect of receiving better encouragement and &s;upport here, than in their own country. Many have already come and as fa&s;t as encouragement may be offered, or pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s appear, &s;o fa&s;t will the manu|factories of the United States be &s;upported by foreign workmen; be&s;ides this, there are thou&s;ands of youths in the States, &s;uffering for &s;uch kinds of employment as the different branches of manufacture would af|ford them.</P>
<P>The creator and benefactor of men, hath in great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, &s;o diver&s;ified the natural abi|lities, genius and di&s;po&s;ition of mankind, that they have a natural propen&s;ity and turn of mind to dif|ferent occupations and employments, whereby their nece&s;&s;ities and conveniencies are mutually provided for, and &s;upplied. Hu&s;bandry therefore is not pre|ferred by every one as an agreeable employment, nor
<PB N="26" REF="021774_0025_0FB59DC0C3BF80D0">entered into by tho&s;e who have a natural propen&s;ity to &s;ome other occupation, if &s;uch could be found and entered into with pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To this we may add another con&s;ideration; the manufacturing bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o laborious as field hu&s;bandry, and productive of more advantage to a labourer, &s;o that tho&s;e who have no lands of their own and nothing to depend on for a &s;upport but their la|bour, will undoubtedly, and in fact, &s;uch always did prefer &s;ome kind of handicraft bu&s;ine&s;s to hu&s;ban|dry.</P>
<P N="3">3d. It hath al&s;o been &s;ugge&s;ted by way of objec|tion, that manufactures would prejudice the agricul|tural and commercial intere&s;ts of the United States. That it would le&s;&s;en the occa&s;ion of trade, the nece&s;|&s;ity of importations being dimini&s;hed, and of con&s;e|quence would le&s;&s;en the demand for the u&s;ual pro|ductions of the country&mdash;To this I would ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>That in proportion to the extent of manufactures, would be the increa&s;e of inhabitants, and con&s;e|quently of the con&s;umption of the fruits of the earth, and in the &s;ame proportion would be the demand for the materials for manufacturing, which would be an advantageous &s;ub&s;titute for many of the unprofi|table productions of the country; for many of them are the re&s;ult of nece&s;&s;ity, and had much better be &s;u&s;|pended.&mdash;The increa&s;e in the home con&s;umption of the agricultural productions of the country, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures, would I conceive be more than a counterbalance to a diminution in their demand in foreign markets in con&s;equence thereof; be&s;ides &s;uch of the productions of the United States as now find a profitable market abroad, will probably continue the &s;ame, let returns be made in what they will.</P>
<P>The We&s;t-India i&s;lands will always receive many &s;upplies from the States, for they are dependent on this country for them. The European nations al&s;o
<PB N="27" REF="021774_0026_0FB59DC25B836D30">will receive many articles of produce from the States, becau&s;e they can &s;upply them&s;elves from hence on better terms than from any other country. In addi|tion to the&s;e the trade ju&s;t began in A&s;ia, together with that which might be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the coa&s;t of Africa, and that which may probably be opened up the Mediterranean, will altogether be fully &s;ufficient to take the &s;urplus productions of the United States.</P>
<P>But &s;o far from commerce being injured by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures, it would derive e&s;|&s;ential &s;upports therefrom. Manufactures I conceive might &s;oon be &s;o increa&s;ed in this country, as to ena|ble it to export many articles of manufacture, which in every re&s;pect is preferable and far more profitable than the exportation of unimproved produce.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Notwith&s;tanding the objections which have been and are &s;till made, by many to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures in the United States, yet I con|ceive there are no ob&s;tacles in the way but may be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>Great-Britain was once under much greater di&s;ad|vantages, with re&s;pect to the introduction and pro|gre&s;s of manufactures, than the United States now are, yet by the judicious mea&s;ures and &s;pirited exer|tions of the government of that nation, it has over|come every difficulty; carried manufactures to an a&s;toni&s;hing length and degree of perfection; and by that has become the mo&s;t opulent and powerful na|tion in Europe.</P>
<P>The United States are under better natural ad|vantages to manufacture than Great-Britain ever was, or ever will be; they have a greater variety of raw materials, which if not now, might very &s;oon be increa&s;ed to any requi&s;ite quantity; they produce in a great abundance all the nece&s;&s;ary articles of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance, which is not always the ca&s;e in Great-Bri|tain; there is not a manufacturing art in Europe but might readily be obtained, and with re&s;pect to work|men,
<PB N="28" REF="021774_0027_0FB59DC3F6771998">I apprehend as fa&s;t as manufactures are en|couraged, workmen will be found and on rea&s;onable terms.</P>
<P>There is therefore, I conceive no natural or in&s;u|perable ob&s;tacle in the way of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s of manufactures in the United States; and the advantages of manufacturing are of of &s;uch importance both to the nation as &s;uch, and to individuals, that it certainly ought to be made an object of particular attention, and excite the exer|tions of the people in general, and of the national legi&s;lature. The patrioti&s;m of the people might do much, but without the aid of government, manufac|tures in the United States will never be carried to any great extent, or arrive at a great degree of perfec|tion.</P>
<P>Many mea&s;ures I conceive might be taken both by individuals and by the government, for the advance|ment and &s;upport of the intere&s;t of manufactures in the &s;tates.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures on good and &s;ufficient capitals is e&s;&s;ential to their pro&s;perity. Every branch of manufacture would be greatly bene|fited by this; but there are &s;ome could not be put into operation without great pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A fear of failure has I apprehend hitherto deterred peo|ple of property from attempting &s;uch manufactures; but if the national government &s;hould give &s;uitable protection to manufactures which cannot be doubted, they will, it is to be hoped and expected, receive the aid of men of wealth. By &s;upports of this kind the linen, woollen and cotton manufactures in this coun|try might &s;oon rival the European manufactures in their cheapne&s;s and quality, if not in their quantity; and I cannot but be of opinion from many facts which have fallen within the ob&s;ervation of every one, that tho&s;e gentlemen who have loo&s;e property and have improved their money in trade becau&s;e they
<PB N="29" REF="021774_0028_0FB59DCCC01485E8">could not find a more profitable u&s;e to put it to, would have profited them&s;elves and benefited the public much more had they have turned their attention, and applied their money to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufac|tures.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the late war the trading part of the people and tho&s;e who entered into trade about that time, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of money &s;ufficient to have e&s;tab|li&s;hed every nece&s;&s;ary manufactory in the country, even at the high prices labour and materials then were, be&s;ides furni&s;hing the people with their nece&s;&s;aries. Had this money been improved in this way it would have been retained and &s;ecured, at the &s;ame time a property as permanent and productive as the lands, which are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;o. But it has been ex|ported out of the country, and brought in return lux|urious, &s;uperfluous and frivolous merchandize, mo&s;t or all of which are now con&s;umed and peri&s;hed, leav|ing nothing but a di&s;agreeable reflection of the mi&s;ap|plication of a property of great magnitude.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Another &s;upport which manufactures might receive from individuals, is the cultivation and in|crea&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ary raw materials; this &s;upport depends on the planters and hu&s;bandmen, and two motives ought, I conceive, to &s;timulate them to exertions herein: the one is the public, and the other the private advantages which are to be derived from manufactures; &s;etting a&s;ide con&s;iderations of public advantage, it would undoubtedly be more to the pri|vate intere&s;t of individuals to exchange their raw pro|ductions for home manufactures on terms of equality, than to throw away a great deal of labour in the pro|ductions of certain articles for foreign markets for the purpo&s;e of procuring foreign manufactures, which has always been done on terms of inequality.</P>
<P>It is true, one of the mo&s;t powerful incentives a planter or hu&s;bandman could have to exertions in the cultivation of the nece&s;&s;ary materials for manufactu|ring,
<PB N="30" REF="021774_0029_0FB59DCFD5DBF668">is a &s;ure and profitable market. Such a market depends on the &s;upport and encouragement which the government may give to manufactures, and as e|very po&s;&s;ible encouragement and &s;upport will undoubt|edly be given by the legi&s;lature, the planter and hu&s;|bandman may begin with a good degree of a&s;&s;urance, to make the cultivation and production of the manu|facturing materials an object of attention.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The particular mea&s;ures which government might take and which I conceive are e&s;&s;ential to the encouragement and &s;upport of the manufacturing in|tere&s;t of the United States are&mdash;1&s;t. To prohibit the importation of &s;uch articles of manufacture as are al|ready furni&s;hed in &s;ufficient quantities for the u&s;e of the people&mdash;2d. To prohibit the importation of &s;uch articles as might &s;pecially be furni&s;hed, and which by a temporary deficiency the people would not be laid under any &s;pecial inconvenience&mdash;3d. Such articles as might be &s;oon furni&s;hed, and which would di&s;com|mode the people, were they prohibited before &s;upplies could be obtained from our own manufactories, I ap|prehend &s;hould be charged with &s;uch a duty on their importation as would give a &s;mall preference in mar|ket to the productions of the United States&mdash;and 4th. Whenever any branch of manufacture arrives to &s;uch a degree of perfection as to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the people, protect it by a total prohibition on the impor|tation of the like foreign articles; even let it be in it|&s;elf of ever &s;o trifling a con&s;ideration, for many &s;mall things in the cour&s;e of time will amount to &s;omething of importance.</P>
<P>Under the two fir&s;t de&s;cription of articles I con&s;i|der the following, viz&mdash;Anchors, axes, plantation hoes, &s;cythes, ca&s;t iron of all kinds, &s;cale beams, &s;teel|yards, &s;toves, Engli&s;h &s;teel, mounted &s;words, hangers and cutla&s;&s;es, &s;heer iron, bells of all de&s;criptions, &s;ad|dles, bridles, &s;hoes, boots, boot legs and foal leather; every other kind of leather manufactures, coaches and
<PB N="31" REF="021774_0030_0FB59DD1B1D47C28">all kinds of carriages, fire engines, cabinet, joiners and turners work, walking &s;ticks and whips, billiard tables, backgammon tables, umbrellas clocks, jew|ellery, gold and &s;ilver plate, gauging rods, &s;ea com|pa&s;&s;es, quadrants, cordage, burr mill-&s;tones manufac|tured, cyder, porter, ale, cordial waters, &s;oap, can|dles, lint&s;eed oil, paints ground in oil, refined &s;ugar, &s;nuff, and all kinds of manufactured tobacco, &s;tarch, mu&s;tard, cloaths and millenery ready made up, bea|ver, ca&s;tor and felt hats, playing cards, paper hang|ings, buckles of every kind, &s;leeve-buttons, toys, bru&s;hes of every &s;ort, wool and cotton cards, tin ware, horn combs, mu&s;ical in&s;truments, &s;alt petre, probably &s;everal other articles which have e&s;caped my recol|lection; al&s;o, &s;pelling-books, primers, p&s;alters, te&s;ta|ments, perhaps bibles, together with a number of fri|volous articles, as bird cages, mou&s;e traps and the like; al&s;o, joiners tools in &s;tocks.</P>
<P>To this enumeration I would add a few remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. I have frequently heard objections made to the laying prohibitions, becau&s;e as it is &s;aid the manufac|turers in this country will take advantage of it and rai&s;e the price of their productions. To which I would ob&s;erve, 1&s;t. That if the United States ever intend to make manufactures an object, they mu&s;t at one time or another lay prohibitions, for without, the manufactures of this country will not be &s;ufficiently encouraged; and whenever prohibitions do take place, this con&s;equence may po&s;&s;ibly follow; but it will not be of long duration. By the encouragement of good prices, numbers will be influenced to enter into the manufacturing bu&s;ine&s;s; by numbers entering into the bu&s;ine&s;s their productions will be increa&s;ed beyond an immediate demand, and as &s;oon as this is the ca&s;e the price of manufactures will be reduced to a rea&s;onable &s;tandard&mdash;2d. Such an inconvenience to individuals will be of no prejudice to the inter|e&s;t of the public; &s;o much property will be in the na|tion,
<PB N="32" REF="021774_0031_0FB59DD40F69C148">let it be in who&s;e hands it will&mdash;3d. The advan|tages to the public of acquiring property by the arts and indu&s;try of the people, which eventually benefits every individual, are by a great difference more im|portant than the di&s;advantages of giving a &s;mall ad|vance in the price of their nece&s;&s;ary manufactures. The objection therefore does dot appear to me to have a weight &s;ufficient to prevent &s;uch prohibitions being laid as may be found nece&s;&s;ary to encourage and &s;upport the manufactures of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is probable it will be found nece&s;&s;ary to per|mit the importation of &s;ome of the&s;e articles into &s;ome of the &s;tates while they are prohibited in others for rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned; but on &s;uch terms I con|ceive as will encourage and &s;upport home manufac|tures in all the &s;tates.</P>
<P N="3">3d. As it is of importance to mankind that the &s;criptures be pre&s;erved and handed down to po&s;teri|ty in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t purity, &s;o I conceive it to be of con&s;equence that their publication in this coun|try &s;hould be under proper regulations. The editi|ons publi&s;hed in the &s;tates, which I have &s;een, are faulty. Faulty and incorrect editions may and in|deed they tend to the introduction of e&s;&s;ential errors. To prevent which, I would &s;ugge&s;t as a que&s;tion, whe|ther it would not be proper that the publication of the &s;criptures or any parts of them &s;hould not be li|cen&s;ed and patented, and the pre&s;s under the in&s;pec|tion of a committee?</P>
<P>Under the third de&s;cription of articles, I con&s;ider &s;ail cloth and all kinds of hempen cloth, cotton cloths, woollen, linen and cotton ho&s;iery, iron &s;hovels and &s;pades, frying pans, bra&s;s, copper and pewter manu|factures; fire arms, gunpowder, hand bellows, and paper, types, and probably &s;ome other articles which not at this time occur to me.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t or all our woollen and linen manufactures might very &s;oon be performed in this country, with
<PB N="33" REF="021774_0032_0FB59DD69CE435B0">exertions, &s;o al&s;o might our ironmongery and cut|lery; but as they are nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e and &s;ervi|ces of the people, and but few of the&s;e manufactures began; I conceive to charge them with a heavy duty at this time, would lay the people under a real hard&s;hip, without the pro&s;pect of immediate advantage, as in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e articles which I have enumerated; however when the&s;e, in any of their branches &s;hall be &s;o far advanced, as to afford a pro&s;pect of their arriving at a point of importance, they &s;hould receive the &s;upport of government.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the prohibitions and duties on articles of importation, I conceive there are &s;ome other public mea&s;ures, which if adopted would tend e&s;&s;entially to the &s;upport of the manufactures of the United States. Among &s;everal which might be &s;ugge&s;ted, I would mention the following:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A prohibition on the exportation of &s;uch ma|terials, as might be wholly manufactured in the coun|try; of &s;uch I think of but one at pre&s;ent, and that is fur. All the fur collected in the country might, I apprehend be manufactured in it, if &s;o, an advan|tage of three or four hundred per cent, on the fur which is now exported, would be acquired and re|tained.</P>
<P N="2">2d. A free importation of &s;uch articles as are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s of manufactures in the States, which are not produced in them, or not produced in &s;ufficient quantities, or of a quality &s;ufficiently good of &s;uch articles, I reckon cotton. The culture of this article is increa&s;ing fa&s;t in the &s;outhern States, and bids fair to render a prohibition on the importation of foreign cotton re|qui&s;ite in a &s;hort time, unle&s;s it &s;hould be found of advantage to mix foreign cotton with it, but at pre|&s;ent an importation may be nece&s;&s;ary. To this may be added fine wool, until at lea&s;t the breed of &s;heep is improved in this country,&mdash;al&s;o hemp, until the
<PB N="34" REF="021774_0033_0FB59DDD64198BF0">cultivation of this article becomes more exten&s;ive in the States, together with allum, copperas, &s;ulphur, tin|plates, pewter, lead, bra&s;s, copper, paints not ground, except lampblack, burr &s;tones, dying woods and all kind of dyes, except indigo, mahogany, lignumvitae, ebony, box wood, elephants teeth, perhaps hides,&mdash; al&s;o machines, new con&s;tructed in&s;truments, &amp;c. for the improvement of agriculture and manufactures, and for the benefit of the arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Some &s;pecial encouragements for the introduc|tion of &s;uch manufacturing arts as are not generally known; &s;uch offers I conceive might be made, as would introduce into the States, every manufacturing &s;ecret in Europe.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Some exemptions with re&s;pect to taxes, gran|ted to manufactories and to manufacturers; en|couragements of this nature have a great influence on the minds of artificers and labourers, much more than on their property. The very idea of patronage gives life and vigor to indu&s;try and the arts. It &s;ti|mulates the people to exertions, and throws a chear|ful ray on the toil&s;ome labour of their hands; and I know of no demon&s;tration of a public and general patronage of manufactures, more expre&s;&s;ive than an exemption from taxes tho&s;e who are employed in the manufacturing bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>COMMERCE in its connections and influences is undoubtedly capable of producing a variety of important advantages to a nation, particularly in the&s;e re&s;pects: It provides a market for the &s;urplus produc|tions of a country, which otherwi&s;e would be render|ed u&s;ele&s;s and of no value: It furni&s;hes the people
<PB N="35" REF="021774_0034_0FB59DDEC501A978">with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries, comforts and conveniences, as their own country doth not furni&s;h and produce, and it gives employment and &s;upport to a great number of people of various profe&s;&s;ions and occupations: It is al&s;o the medium by which a nation accumulates wealth &mdash;Commerce therefore merits the encouragement and &s;upport of government.</P>
<P>But, although commerce is adapted to the promo|tion of public intere&s;t, and productive of many pri|vate benefits and advantages; yet, it may produce ruinous con&s;equences to a nation: for which rea&s;on, it is incumbent on the legi&s;lative authority, to re&s;train the licentious operations of commerce, to which it naturally tends, and &s;o to regulate it as to render it &s;ub&s;ervient to the general intere&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>If a free and open trade was admitted by all nations, it would, perhaps, promote the greate&s;t intere&s;t and happine&s;s of mankind, at lea&s;t, it is the opinion of many writers on the &s;ubject; but &s;ince mo&s;t, or all nations keep their mercantile intere&s;t &s;eparate&mdash;&s;ince they aim at engro&s;&s;ing an unequal &s;hare of commercial advantages&mdash;at &s;ecuring in a particular manner the advantages which re&s;ult from their own &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, and of rivalling other nations; the idea of a free and unlimited trade is highly impoli|tic and ab&s;urd: The chain of a free and univer&s;al commercial intercour&s;e being once broken, by any one nation, every other nation included in the cir|cle of corre&s;pondence, is laid under an obligation thereby to &s;ecure their own intere&s;ts, and retain their ju&s;t &s;hare of advantages.</P>
<P>The nations of Europe, with whom the United States maintain a commercial intercour&s;e, have con|&s;idered their mercantile intere&s;t as wholly &s;eparate from the intere&s;t of all other nations, and taken the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to prevent others from parti|cipating in the advantages which their &s;ituation and circum&s;tances afford. The United States therefore
<PB N="36" REF="021774_0035_0FB59DE05B9BC790">ought to adopt and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame principles, and regulate their trade in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ecure them&s;elves the commercial advantages which are to be derived from their circum&s;tances, and prevent other nations from taking &s;uch prejudicial liberties as a licentious commerce unavoidably expo&s;es them to.</P>
<P>There are certain objects, therefore, to which the commerce of the United States ought to be directed, and to which it &s;hould be confined; as 1&s;t. To pro|cure a profitable and advantageous market for the &s;ur|plus productions of the country: 2d. To &s;upply the people with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as the country doth not furni&s;h: 3d. To give employment and &s;upport to the merchant, mariner and mechanic: 4th. To increa&s;e the circulating property; and 5th. To become a ba&s;is on which to e&s;tabli&s;h a national revenue.</P>
<P>The&s;e are objects which I conceive &s;hould be par|ticularly attended to, and had in view in forming a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations; and that I may communicate my ideas on this &s;ubject in the cleare&s;t and be&s;t manner, I would arrange them under the &s;everal particulars which I have here &s;tated.</P>
<P N="1">I. To procure an advantageous foreign market for the &s;urplus productions of the country, is one benefit of commerce, and an object to be had in view in the commercial regulations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;triking idea which ari&s;es in our minds here, is, the obtaining the greate&s;t price for the productions of the country. The &s;pirit of &s;peculation &s;o prevalent among merchants, will always direct to a proper choice in this particular; and were it not for circum&s;tances connected therewith, the interference of government with re&s;pect to markets would be un|nece&s;&s;ary. But when trade is under no legal re&s;tric|tions, and the productions of the country at liberty to be exported to &s;uch markets and in &s;uch methods as are mo&s;t agreeable to the intere&s;t, convenience and private views of individuals, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="37" REF="021774_0036_0FB59DE877BA9DE8">greate&s;t prices are obtained, yet it will mo&s;t common|ly be attended with two con&s;equences extremely pre|judicial to the intere&s;t of the nation; the one is with re&s;pect to the returns which are frequently &s;uch as tend to interfere with and &s;uppre&s;s the agricultural and manufacturing intere&s;ts, and which are luxuri|ous, frivolous and unprofitable; and the other is, it may and in fact often does contribute to the &s;upport of rival intere&s;ts in foreign nations; for which rea&s;ons it appears to me that there is a nece&s;&s;ity that govern|ment &s;hould not only pre&s;cribe the mode of com|merce, but direct the foreign markets to which the productions of the country may be exported.</P>
<P>The particular mea&s;ures which I conceive govern|ment might take to procure and promote a beneficial market for the productions of the country in foreign nations and countries are the&s;e, viz. 1&s;t. To form treaties of friend&s;hip and commerce with &s;uch nations, wherein there is a profitable demand for the produc|tions of the &s;tates, and with whom a trade may be e&s;|tabli&s;hed on the principles of mutual advantage&mdash;2d. To remove the impediments out of the way of &s;uch profitable markets as may be ob&s;tructed&mdash;3d. To aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the merchants in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any new trade which may be found, and which may re|quire public &s;upport&mdash;and 4th, To form &s;uch regu|lations as would tend to &s;upport the value of the pro|duce of the United States in foreign markets. To the&s;e I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That altho' the &s;tates have entered into trea|ties of friend&s;hip and trade with &s;ome of the Europe|an nations, in which a good market for many of their productions are found; yet with Great Britain where a great part of the produce of the &s;tates go to for a market, and from whom the greater part of their &s;up|plies of manufactures are received, no treaty hath or could be entered into; the rea&s;on of which I conceive to be that Great Britain entertaining an opinion that
<PB N="38" REF="021774_0037_0FB59DEB98F92870">in con&s;equence of the broken &s;tate of the American government, the difference in their local intere&s;ts, the &s;pirit of rivalry and jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, and the obligations the merchants of the &s;tates were under to the merchants of that nation, no general re|gulations &s;uch as would render the commerce of the two countries reciprocally beneficial, would ever be adopted by the &s;tates. Great Britain therefore pro|ceeded on this idea, and pre&s;cribed the terms and mode of trade between that nation and this, which are founded on the principles of a monopoly. All the pro&s;its, all the advantages which are to be derived from the trade are &s;ecured to Great Britain; all the di&s;advantages devolve on the &s;tates. The advantages which Great Britain derives from the commerce of the United States in the mode in which it is now car|ried on are many and important; and &s;o long as they can be held, no propo&s;als for a treaty of commerce will I conceive be attended to by that nation; and I am humbly of opinion that nothing but the &s;pirited and decided mea&s;ures of the legi&s;lature of the United States will ever produce a treaty of commerce with Great Britain, or &s;ecure to the &s;tates an equal &s;hare of advantages in the commerce of the two countries.</P>
<P>In general I would ob&s;erve, that a trade carried on be|tween two nations on &s;ufferance, is always precarious, liable to many impo&s;itions, and never reciprocally ad|vantageous; for no two nations were ever &s;o circum|&s;tanced as to maintain an equilibrium in the benefits of commerce, without &s;tipulating the terms on which it &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted: One will derive unequal ad|vantages; the other in con&s;equence thereof will be &s;ubjected to proportional di&s;advantages; for which rea&s;on I conceive a treaty of commerce &s;hould in the fir&s;t in&s;tance be formed and entered into by the United States, with tho&s;e nations in which an advantageous market for their productions may be found.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="021774_0038_0FB59DED06BC0790">
2d. A profitable trade I apprehend might be carri|ed on by the United States up the Mediterranean, could a &s;ettlement, and a treaty of amity with the Dey of Algiers be effected; but as the depredations com|mitted on the navigation of the United States by the Algerines, were begun and are now &s;upported by the intrigues, and through the influence of the Briti&s;h court, it will be a work of no &s;mall difficulty to pro|cure the peace and friend&s;hip of that piratical &s;tate. The legi&s;lature of the United States however will un|doubtedly continue attempts for the accompli&s;hment of &s;o important an end, whereby the freedom and property of the citizens of the States may be &s;ecured, and a trade opened up the Mediterranean.</P>
<P N="3">3d. An advantageous trade I conceive might be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the coa&s;t of Africa, particularly that part called the Gold Coa&s;t, where a profitable mar|ket might be found for the productions of the States; this country di&s;tilled rum particularly; and where al&s;o &s;everal valuable articles by way of return are to be had. But whether an exten&s;ive and &s;afe trade could be carried on there without e&s;tabli&s;hing factories, and they &s;upported by the power of the States, I will not pretend to determine; neither will I pretend to &s;ay whether the States have it conveniently in their pow|er to &s;upport factories on that coa&s;t, &s;hould national &s;upport be nece&s;&s;ary. If however, it &s;hould appear that an exten&s;ive trade could be opened and carried on there, I &s;hould imagine the government would con|&s;ider it an object worthy of attention, and as far as was in its power, give the trade every aid and &s;up|port; for every new market which can be found for, and every new con&s;umer of the productions of the States, not only advances the intere&s;t of commerce in particular, but eventually promotes every particu|lar intere&s;t of the nation, except in tho&s;e in&s;tances where a rival intere&s;t is &s;upported thereby. Be&s;ides, I know of no nation or country with whom the States
<PB N="40" REF="021774_0039_0FB59DEE81502E80">carry on a trade, where commodities in return are to be found more valuable.</P>
<P N="4">4th. A profitable market for &s;everal of the pro|ductions of the States, might be found in the Spani&s;h American dominions, were it po&s;&s;ible to obtain per|mi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e from the court of Spain. This however, can &s;carcely be hoped for, con&s;idering the policy of the Spani&s;h nation with re&s;pect to its trade. It may neverthele&s;s be worth while to attempt it, for there are certain times when nations, as well as indi|viduals, feel more liberally di&s;po&s;ed than is u&s;ually the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The trade ju&s;t began to A&s;ia, might, I appre|hend, be productive of many benefits to the States, were it pro&s;ecuted upon a judicious and well con|&s;tructed plan; but if my informations are to be de|pended upon, and my ideas of the trade as it is now circum&s;tanced, ju&s;t, I cannot think it beneficial to the States, or as lucrative to adventurers as &s;uch a trade ought to be.</P>
<P>There are among others, two objects to be kept in view as e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;t of this trade;&mdash;the one is the &s;upport of the value of the produce of the States in the markets of A&s;ia, and the other is the quality of the merchandize received there in return.</P>
<P>If the value of American produce exported, could be &s;upported in &s;uch a manner as to make profitable returns to the merchants, it would render the trade beneficial to the public; becau&s;e it would be the mo&s;t direct and advantageous method by which the States could import the productions of A&s;ia; but if the produce of the States, fall in their price in &s;uch a manner as to render the exportation of con&s;iderable &s;ums of money nece&s;&s;ary, in order to make the voyages profitable, I apprehend no advantage accrues to the public by the trade: for in the fir&s;t place I conceive the States cannot at this time export large &s;ums of money without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing other intere&s;ts, of
<PB N="41" REF="021774_0040_0FB59DF86DBDEA48">more con&s;equence than any, or all the luxuries of the Ea&s;t. Were there &s;uch an influx of money into the States, that there was a danger of its depreciating in value, the exportation of money would be advi&s;e|able and nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;this however is not the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; or were the importations from A&s;ia nece&s;|&s;ary, or applied to the &s;upport and promotion of &s;ome other national intere&s;t, the exportation of money for the &s;upport of the trade, might not be di&s;advan|tageous; but this is not the ca&s;e. The importations from that country are all of the luxurious kind; are incapable of improvement, and are not applied to the promotion of any other intere&s;t, or did the A&s;iatic trade bring into the &s;tates as much money as it carried out, no inconvenience to the public intere&s;t would ari&s;e by the exportation of money; but this al&s;o is not the ca&s;e&mdash;The States have no foreign market for their importations from A&s;ia; the trade originates and ter|minates within them&s;elves. In the &s;econd place, as no freight can be made on money, the profits on the importation or returns mu&s;t be augmented, in order to &s;upport the merchant in the trade. This addi|tional profit mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be drawn from the peo|ple of the States, &s;ince no foreign market is opened for India goods through this channel.</P>
<P>A &s;upply of any kind of merchandize, more than &s;ufficient for the immediate u&s;e and con&s;umption of the people, will always be the occa&s;ion of reducing their price in any market. This is a circum&s;tance com|mon to all, for which rea&s;on &s;uitable mea&s;ures ought to be adopted to prevent, as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch an inconvenience in voyages, as lengthy, expen&s;ive and important as tho&s;e are from the United States to A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The voyages from this country to that are wholly unconnected with one another; and con&s;equently the bu&s;ine&s;s of negociation is in the hands of the &s;uper|cargoes of each &s;hip. The intere&s;t of each particular voyage is the object of the re&s;pective &s;upercargoes;
<PB N="42" REF="021774_0041_0FB59DF9C10206B0">and of cour&s;e a competition of intere&s;ts naturally takes place between them. Di&s;patch is with them a con&s;i|deration of equal, or greater moment, than the &s;up|port of the value of the produce of this country, and a temporary private advantage of greater account than a permanent and durable public profit and intere&s;t. The&s;e circum&s;tances, I conceive, have been the oc|ca&s;ion of American produce being &s;old at a reduced price from time to time in the markets of A&s;ia, until, as I have been informed, it will not pay a freight in any mea&s;ure equal to the length and expence of the voyage: And as there are no e&s;tabli&s;hed American factories in the &s;ea ports of A&s;ia&mdash;no well e&s;tabli&s;hed corre&s;pondents in the country, and American cargoes &s;old on the &s;pot, on the be&s;t terms that can be obtain|ed, and cargoes received in return in &s;uch articles as are at hand, and that can be the ea&s;ie&s;t procured, <HI>un|merchantable</HI> goods, &s;uch as are refu&s;ed at the Euro|pean factories, are in con&s;equence of the&s;e circum|&s;tances palmed upon the American merchants, ex|tremely prejudicial to the trade.</P>
<P>I am by no means po&s;itive in my opinion re&s;pecting the A&s;iatic trade, for it is founded on but tran&s;ient information, and my own reflections on the &s;ubject; but until I am convinced by &s;uperior evidence, I mu&s;t think that if the trade from the United States to A&s;ia was a company concern, and the bu&s;ine&s;s in that country negociated by one &s;et of merchants; or in any method which would unite the American mer|cantile intere&s;t in A&s;ia, and render it the &s;ame, it would be a means of &s;upporting the value of Ameri|can produce in tho&s;e markets, and of procuring in return merchandize of the be&s;t qualities; and the&s;e I conceive are objects of important con&s;ideration in the trade. Neverthele&s;s, admitting the&s;e remarks to be ju&s;t, and that it would be po&s;&s;ible to put the trade upon a more advantageous footing, I know not whe|ther the government could con&s;titutionally, or with
<PB N="43" REF="021774_0042_0FB59DFB4ADA7140">propriety interfere, or take any mea&s;ures re&s;pecting it. If however it &s;hould be found that any regula|tions which government might form, would tend to keep an important branch of commerce from dwin|dling into nothing&mdash;to re&s;tore it to its expected con|&s;equence, and to render it of public benefit, I &s;hould imagine &s;uch national mea&s;ures as would an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, might with rea&s;on and propriety be taken.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;upply the people with &s;uch <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> articles of produce and manufactures as their own country doth <HI>not</HI> furni&s;h, is one principal end and de&s;ign of commerce.</P>
<P>No man ever was or ever will be &s;o independent as not to need a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his fellow creatures, or to render a commercial intercour&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;ame mutual dependence which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between indivi|duals in the &s;ame country, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between countries them&s;elves. No nation or country furni&s;hes every thing nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort and convenience of its inhabi|tants, in &s;uch a manner that the happine&s;s of the inha|bitants of the re&s;pective countries could not be aug|mented by an exchange of their productions. Com|merce therefore is e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;t and happi|ne&s;s of mankind on this account. Be&s;ides, it is the be&s;t calculated mean of promoting the intere&s;t of &s;ociety; but as this is foreign from my de&s;ign, &s;hall wave it.</P>
<P>By an exchange of commodities, giving &s;uch as an individual or a country produces in &s;urplus quantities, and receiving by way of return &s;uch as are not pro|duced, and which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, com|&s;ort and convenience, the happine&s;s of mankind is reciprocally promoted, and the original end and de|&s;ign of commerce fully an&s;wered: And &s;o long as the commerce of two nations or countries is carried on with this view, and confined within the limits of this rule, it an&s;wers its original and e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es. But whenever it breaks over this natural boundary&mdash; when no re&s;trictions are laid on the importations into
<PB N="44" REF="021774_0043_0FB59DFD10B76F28">a country, and the emolument of individuals becomes the only object of trade, without regard to national welfare, it will nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably produce prejudicial con&s;equences; and in proportion to the prejudices which one nation &s;uffers by &s;uch an unre|&s;tricted commerce, will be the extraordinary advan|tages received by the other nation.</P>
<P>We often overlook the influence and effect of a li|centious trade on the intere&s;t of a nation, either be|cau&s;e we do not like to inve&s;tigate a &s;ubject of &s;o ex|ten&s;ive and complicated a nature, in which we &s;up|po&s;e we have no immediate concern; or becau&s;e they are diffu&s;ive, and not confined to any particular object. But, &s;hould a wealthy planter in any part of the country, permit his children or &s;ervants to import from another part of the country, &s;uch articles of produce as he produced him&s;elf, and &s;upply his u&s;ual cu&s;tomers and purcha&s;ers therewith, the effect it would have on his intere&s;t would be &s;triking and obvious to every one: The effect and the cau&s;e would be clearly &s;een and under&s;tood by every man, and it would be a conclu&s;ion univer&s;ally agreed in, that &s;uch a man, continuing to permit &s;uch a conduct, mu&s;t in the end be inevitably ruined. This conclu&s;ion applies with equal force and ju&s;tice to a nation that permits a licen|tious trade&mdash;that permits the importation of &s;uch ar|ticles of produce and manufacture as it produces and manufactures it&s;elf. All the difference between a na|tion and an individual con&s;i&s;ts in this; in the one ca&s;e, the prejudice is pointed and in&s;upportable; in the other, it is diffu&s;ive, and by being borne by a nation, is &s;upportable. And,</P>
<P>If it be repugnant to the intere&s;t of a nation to import into it &s;uch articles of produce and manufac|ture as it actually <HI>doth</HI> furni&s;h, it mu&s;t al&s;o in &s;ome degree be prejudicial to import freely &s;uch articles as it <HI>might</HI> produce and manufacture; becau&s;e this would be cutting off a &s;ource of national wealth at the foun|tain
<PB N="45" REF="021774_0044_0FB59E06D8726470">head; it would be de&s;troying a &s;eed in the earth, which one day might have become a flouri&s;hing plant.</P>
<P>But my idea in &s;tating this rule or maxim, ex|tends further, and aims at laying a re&s;traint on the importation of foreign luxuries, and frivolous arti|cles of merchandize, notwith&s;tanding the country may not furni&s;h them; becau&s;e they are <HI>not nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>The free importation and unre&s;trained u&s;e of &s;uch articles, injures the intere&s;t of the country in a varie|ty of re&s;pects. It tends to vitiate the ta&s;te, and cor|rupt the morals of the people; to enervate the &s;inews of indu&s;try; to de&s;troy that &s;pirit of oeconomy which ought to be pre&s;erved in the body of the people; to in&s;pire them with a &s;pirit of vanity, and to excite an illaudable ambition of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by pagean|try and &s;hew; to draw them in&s;en&s;ibly into habits of di&s;&s;ipation and profu&s;e expences; and it directly draws their hard earned and valuable property away for that which is of no real u&s;e to them.</P>
<P>Were articles of luxury and &s;uperfluity the produc|tion of the country which con&s;umes them, one ma|terial ill con&s;equence, as it re&s;pects the intere&s;t of the public, would not follow; which is, that notwith|&s;tanding individuals might be ruined by a too free u&s;e of unnece&s;&s;ary articles, &s;till the property would remain in the nation: But by freely importing from foreign nations, and making u&s;e of &s;uch articles, the folly and lo&s;s becomes national.</P>
<P>In applying the&s;e general remarks to the commerce of the United States, &s;ince the revolution, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the welfare of the nation, and the con|venience and happine&s;s of the people, have not been the objects aimed at by their trade, but the private advantage and profit of individuals: And as no le|gal re&s;trictions, have been laid on importations, not only nece&s;&s;ary, but luxurious, trifling and u&s;ele&s;s ar|ticles have been imported, and freely made u&s;e of; and the con&s;equence has been, poverty and di&s;tre&s;s among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="021774_0045_0FB59E08C31F35A8">
From among a great variety of luxurious and unne|ce&s;&s;ary articles imported into the United States, I will &s;elect one for particular con&s;ideration; that is ardent &s;pirits. The trifling duty laid on the&s;e by the different States, have laid no re&s;traint on their u&s;e. They are within the reach of every one, and are as freely made u&s;e of as of the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t innocent drinks; and what are the con&s;equences? Perhaps half a milli|on of pounds in money and other property has annu|ally been drawn out of the States for rum, brandy and geneva. Many who might have been u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, have become by the intoxicating draught, perfect brutes&mdash;lo&s;t to &s;ociety&mdash;lo&s;t to their friends and connections, and lo&s;t to them&s;elves. We fre|quently ob&s;erve idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;families re|duced to infamy and di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;riots, quarrels and mur|ders&mdash;a good con&s;titution de&s;troyed early in life, and per&s;ons &s;ent prematurely to the grave, in con&s;equence of the free importation and unre&s;trained u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The United States is a young nation, and requires a great deal of indu&s;try and good oeconomy to ren|der it independent and opulent: No nation therefore can be more e&s;&s;entially injured by a luxurious, di&s;&s;i|pated habit of living; yet none expends &s;o great a quantity of &s;pirituous liquors, according to the num|ber of inhabitants, as the United States, and with le&s;s occa&s;ion; for all the nece&s;&s;ary drinks might be furni&s;hed within them&s;elves, in a great plenty and &s;uf|ficient variety.</P>
<P>Great-Britain is an old nation, and has become opulent; yet, were &s;he to admit of as free a u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits as the United States, it would go nigh to ruining the agricultural and manufacturing inte|re&s;ts of that nation. So &s;en&s;ible is Great-Britain of the ruinous con&s;equences of an unre&s;trained u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, that <HI>rum,</HI> the produce of their own i&s;lands, is charged with &s;uch a duty, as to put it be|yond the reach of people in general.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="021774_0046_0FB59E0A4DF50B38">
As &s;pirituous liquors are no ways nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence, comfort or convenience of the people, but productive of ruinous con&s;equences to individuals, and prejudicial effects on the intere&s;ts of the nation, &s;uch a re&s;traint, I conceive, ought to be put on their u&s;e, as would be &s;ufficient to le&s;&s;en it, and to turn the at|tention of the people to tho&s;e means and advantages which the country hath put into the hands of every man.</P>
<P>A duty therefore &s;o high as would produce this ef|fect, &s;hould be laid on rum, brandy and geneva im|ported into the United States. For my own part I believe a duty of five or &s;ix &s;hillings a gallon, would not be too much to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es intended thereby. Their prices would be rai&s;ed in con&s;equence of &s;uch a duty about two hundred per cent. and if the quantity made u&s;e of was to be le&s;&s;ened in that proportion, it would be fully &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the people every nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e. The man the mo&s;t attached to &s;pirituous liquors, mu&s;t admit in his &s;ober moments, that one third of the rum, &amp;c. u&s;ed by the people, is enough, and more than enough for their benefit. But, as the habits of the people will overpower rea&s;on, and as their virtue is too weak to produce a general reformation, the exertions of the powers of government becomes nece&s;&s;ary to this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are concerned in the rum trade, and import &s;pirituous liquors, might &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves in|jured &s;hould &s;uch a duty be laid; but two con&s;idera|tions are worthy of notice here; the one is, that no good and &s;ufficient rea&s;on can be given, why a general and public evil &s;hould be continued, merely becau&s;e &s;ome individuals are benefited by it; and the other is, the importer would not be &s;o much injured as might at fir&s;t be imagined: The &s;mall duties now laid on rum, &amp;c. are in general a tax on the importer, not on the con&s;umer. Rum is &s;old at about the &s;ame
<PB N="48" REF="021774_0047_0FB59E0BCBA78928">price it would have been, were there no duties laid on it; but if it was charged with a heavy duty, the importer would never think of giving it away: He would con&s;ider it a part of the prime co&s;t, and ac|cordingly compute his profits; and the duty in this ca&s;e would fall where duties always ought to fall, viz. on the con&s;umer. Be&s;ides this, if the importation of rum, &amp;c. &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened in con&s;equence of &s;uch a duty, the demand would be greater than u&s;ual; for, let the price be what it may, there will be tho&s;e who will purcha&s;e and make u&s;e of &s;pirits; con&s;e|quently, the importation might be rendered as pro|fitable as by importing larger quantities.</P>
<P>The importer might make another objection&mdash;That the rum, &amp;c. would not produce money &s;ufficient to pay &s;uch a duty. In this ca&s;e, if he had no other me|thod of procuring money for that purpo&s;e, he would import money with the rum, &amp;c. and, as I ju&s;t ob|&s;erved, con&s;ider it a part of the prime co&s;t. By this the importer would &s;uffer no inconvenience, and the public derive an additional advantage.</P>
<P>Another objection might al&s;o be made&mdash;That le&s;&s;en|ing the importation of the&s;e articles, would le&s;&s;en the demand for the produce of the country. This I will admit, &s;o far as to the &s;taves and hoops which would be nece&s;&s;ary to make ca&s;ks for the rum imported. But to this I would ob&s;erve, that if the lands and la|bour of the people produces nothing in return more valuable and publicly beneficial than &s;pirituous liquors, it would be much more to the benefit of the people to lay a&s;ide &s;uch productions, and turn their attention to &s;omething more profitable and advantageous.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I can remember, and long before, <HI>Con|necticut</HI> has pu&s;hed a trade with the We&s;t-Indies, ex|porting hor&s;es, and importing rum as a principal ar|ticle of return. In this trade, I apprehend, a large &s;um hath annually been &s;unk. For, in the fir&s;t place, the hor&s;e, at the time it is &s;old for exportation, hath
<PB N="49" REF="021774_0048_0FB59E129E9E93C8">in general twice eaten up its value; and the next its returns are con&s;umed in a few days without producing the lea&s;t benefit to the public. I reckon every hor&s;e exported and returned in rum, as &s;o much property lo&s;t to the general intere&s;t; and who the individual is that makes any advantage by rai&s;ing and exporting hor&s;es, I know not; it is evidently not the farmer, and as certainly not the merchant; not one in ten ever made any thing by it, and at lea&s;t five out of that number have been ruined by pur&s;uing the trade.</P>
<P>Were the people to turn their attention to rai&s;ing of &s;heep and the cultivation of the nece&s;&s;ary materi|als for manufacturing, and give manufactures the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upport, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing hor&s;es for exporta|tion and the production of other commodities for the purcha&s;e of rum, they would &s;oon find them&s;elves in the event e&s;&s;entially beneficial; be&s;ides the &s;atisfac|tion of reflecting on the advantages which the general intere&s;ts of the nation would derive from their patri|otic exertions.</P>
<P>The importation of wines I do not con&s;ider as at|tended with &s;uch prejudicial con&s;equences as of ar|dent &s;pirits; wines are not &s;o intoxicating&mdash;are not &s;o de&s;tructive to the con&s;titution, and coming at a higher price are not &s;o generally made u&s;e of. For the&s;e rea&s;ons&mdash;I do not think &s;o high a duty &s;hould be laid on them as on rum, brandy and geneva.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;pirituous liquors, there are a variety of lux|urious and frivolous articles of merchandize imported into the &s;tates, in the highe&s;t degree unnece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e being the produce and manufacture of foreign nations, the people are extremely unwi&s;e in making a general and liberal u&s;e of them. In doing this they give a great deal of valuable and hard earned proper|ty away for things of no real value; and while they thus impoveri&s;h them&s;elves they contribute largely to the emolument of other nations, who po&s;&s;ibly one day or another may &s;courge the &s;tates with the mo|ney
<PB N="50" REF="021774_0049_0FB59E1577B1ACD8">which they now profu&s;ely give them for con&s;ide|rations of little worth. Motives of patrioti&s;m and of policy ought to induce the people to oeconomi&s;e bet|ter. However, as con&s;iderations of public utility and benefit have little or no influence on the minds of tho&s;e who&s;e views centre in them&s;elves, and who&s;e objects are the gratification of their vanity and their apperites; and as the people have been long habitua|ted to the u&s;e of many &s;uper&s;luous and frivolous ar|ticles of foreign produce and manufacture, it will probably be thought not advi&s;able to lay a prohibi|tion on their importation; but I conceive a higher duty &s;hould be laid on them than on nece&s;&s;ary arti|cles; and that for two rea&s;ons&mdash;the one of which is, it would tend to le&s;&s;en their u&s;e and importation; and the other is, they are a proper medium, by which to apply to the pockets of the rich and opulent for mo|ney for the &s;ervices of the public.</P>
<P>Such hath been the perplexed &s;ituation of the go|vernment of the United States, that no &s;y&s;tem or uni|form rule re&s;pecting their importations could be for|med and e&s;tabli&s;hed by legi&s;lative authority; and al|tho' it is a maxim with many that trade will regulate it&s;elf, yet the experience of this country teaches us that views of private advantage with the merchants, often-times carry them beyond the intere&s;t of the public, and in many in&s;tances pu&s;hes them beyond their own; &s;o that no rule &s;uch as would be&s;t promote the pub|lic welfare, can ever be expected will be adopted by the merchants or take place in the common cour&s;e of mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s; and indeed the experience of all commercial nations proves that the intere&s;t and views of individuals are &s;o di&s;cordant among them&s;elves, and in many in&s;tances and many re&s;pects &s;o oppo&s;ed to the intere&s;t of the whole with re&s;pect to importa|tions in a particular manner, that to &s;uffer the com|merce of a nation to be pro&s;ecuted under the idea of its regulating it&s;elf, it would be the means of ruining
<PB N="51" REF="021774_0050_0FB59E18CABACF98">the merchants and of injuring in a &s;pecial manner the national intere&s;t and welfare; trade never regu|lated it&s;elf except with re&s;pect to the prices of mer|chandize in market.</P>
<P>The natural &s;ources of the wealth of the United States, and the general intere&s;ts of the people therefore require the aid of the powers of government for their encouragement, &s;upport and protection; by confi|ning importations from foreign nations to &s;uch nece&s;|&s;ary articles of produce and manufacture as the &s;tates do not furni&s;h. By laying a re&s;traint on the too free importation of &s;uch articles of produce, but e&s;pecially manufactures, as the &s;tates are capable of producing and manufacturing, that they may have an opportu|nity of being brought forward; and on the too free importation and u&s;e of foreign luxuries and frivoli|ties.</P>
<P N="3">III. To give employment and &s;upport to the mer|chant, mariner, mechanic, &amp;c. is another end and de|&s;ign of commerce, and an object to be had in view in forming the general regulations of trade.</P>
<P>The private emoluments of trade are of great con|&s;equence, and as they are of a diffu&s;ive nature and go to the &s;upport of a con&s;iderable proportion of the in|habitants, who as &s;eamen, mechanics and labourers depend on the merchants for employment; and as the acqui&s;itions of commerce are drawn out of the in|du&s;try of the people, it is a matter of e&s;&s;ential differ|ence whether the profits of trade are acquired by fo|reigners, drawn out of the country and applied to the &s;upport of the &s;ubjects of foreign nations, or whether they are acquired by the &s;ubjects or citizens of the &s;tates, and by that means retained, added to the &s;tock of national wealth, and applied to the &s;upport of tho&s;e citizens who are dependent on commerce for employ|ment.</P>
<P>This is an object which it appears to me the &s;tates have hitherto entirely overlooked; for they have
<PB N="52" REF="021774_0051_0FB59E1B8912EBF8">&s;eemed to vie with each other in granting encourage|ments to foreign merchants to re&s;ide and e&s;tabli&s;h mercantile hou&s;es in them. Some few circum&s;cribed and unimportant benefits re&s;ult to a mercantile town by crouding it with merchants; but no general and national advantages are derived from an unnece&s;&s;ary number of merchants, even if they are &s;ubjects or ci|tizens. But the advantages of increa&s;ing foreign merchants in a country or a town, are by no means equal to the di&s;advantages which &s;mally take place. They circulate a little money it is true among the people in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s; but this is no more than the merchants of the &s;tates would do. They ac|quire property by trade out of the indu&s;try of the people, and draw it out of the country into other nations. This the merchants of the &s;tates would <HI>not</HI> do; whatever property they acquired would be retained, which in its revolutions would revert back to the benefit of tho&s;e who produced the proper|ty by their labour. Wherein then con&s;i&s;ts the ad|vantage of employing foreigners in the commercial bu&s;ine&s;s of the United States? For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s whether it proceeds from ignorance or prejudice, or not, I cannot &s;ee any advantage in it; but on the other hand I &s;ee, or at lea&s;t imagine I &s;ee, numberle&s;s important di&s;advantages and prejudicial con&s;equences flowing therefrom. Neither can I &s;ee any <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for it. The &s;tates require nothing more of their merchants than to exchange their &s;urplus productions for &s;uch articles of foreign production as they need on the be&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous terms; and &s;urely there are men enough in the &s;tates of &s;uffi|cient property and competent knowledge and &s;kill in mercantile matters, to tran&s;act all the nece&s;&s;ary com|mercial bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tates; men who are natives of the country&mdash;who have no attachments to any o|ther&mdash;who would retain all the emoluments of trade, and apply them to the benefit of the citizens; then
<PB N="53" REF="021774_0052_0FB59E1D0794FE88">certainly there can be no nece&s;&s;ity or &s;pecial rea&s;on for calling in the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign mer|chants.</P>
<P>Were the foreign mercantile hou&s;es e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States, but few in number, it would &s;carce|ly demand a &s;erious con&s;ideration; but this is not the ca&s;e; mo&s;t of the &s;tates have foreign merchants re&s;iding in them, and in the &s;outhern &s;tates the great|er part of their mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s is engro&s;&s;ed by fo|reigners; con&s;equently mo&s;t of the acqui&s;itions of property by the commerce of the&s;e &s;tates is drawn out of the country into foreign nations. What the an|nual amount of this is cannot be a&s;certained; but when we con&s;ider the quantity of goods &s;old by fo|reign merchants, the advance price generally put on them together with the amount of freights, which in this cour&s;e of trade is naturally &s;ecured to foreign &s;hips, we mu&s;t be convinced that it is of magnitude and worthy of attention.</P>
<P>Great Britain by the mea&s;ures which it has taken through the indulgence of the &s;tates, and I believe I may ju&s;tly add their ill policy, has engro&s;&s;ed and &s;ecu|red every profitable advantage which is to be derived from the commerce of the &s;tates. From the avails of the labour of our hu&s;bandmen does Great Britain derive &s;upport for her merchants, manufacturers and &s;eamen. They are literally hewers of wood and drawers of water to that nation, and in con&s;equence of this &s;ervile and humiliating &s;tate of trade, the citi|zens of the United States are left de&s;titute of the means of &s;upport; many of their merchants have been crouded out of bu&s;ine&s;s and bankrupted; many of their &s;eaman have either been forced from home or reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices on &s;hore; and thou&s;ands of mechanics have been driven abroad to &s;olicit that &s;upport from foreign nations which their own country could not afford them.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="021774_0053_0FB59E1EA8E11E50">
Such indulgencies and &s;uch a preference ought not to be granted by the United States to any nation whatever. To Great Britain the la&s;t. Every man of common under&s;tanding throughout the &s;tates mu&s;t know that Great Britain as a nation is an enemy to this country, and is making u&s;e of every means in its power to ruin the intere&s;ts of the United States, and to bring about an opportunity of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing a do|minion over them. The apparent friendly di&s;po&s;i|tion which may have been &s;hewn by the nation, are but the &s;miles of a fal&s;e friend; &s;o long as the advanta|ges which are now derived from the commerce of the United States &s;hall be continued to Great Britain, &s;o long may its &s;pirit of enmity be re&s;trained within bounds; but no longer after &s;uch monopolizing ad|vantages cea&s;e, than until a favorable opportunity of|fers of employing its power again&s;t the &s;tates with a good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. And I believe it would not be doing violence to truth were I to add, that the &s;ame &s;pirit of prejudice and enmity which prevails in the Briti&s;h nation, predominates in the brea&s;t of mo&s;t if not every Briti&s;h merchant re&s;iding in the &s;tates; the number of whom is &s;o great, that &s;hould the coun|try be again involved in a war, it would find a formi|dable enemy where it ought to look for friends and &s;upports.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean by this that every Briti&s;h merchant re&s;iding in the &s;tates is &s;uch an enemy as to be anxious for an opportunity of draw|ing his &s;word on their citizens. Mercantile connecti|ons will for a time, &s;o long as private intere&s;t can be promoted thereby, &s;heath the &s;word of the bittere&s;t enemy. But it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e people have the intere&s;t and welfare of the United States in view as an object. Their view primarily is to ad|vance their own private intere&s;t; and &s;econdarily is to promote the intere&s;t of the nation to which they be|long. Their friend&s;hip therefore, I was going to ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="55" REF="021774_0054_0FB59E2180A6E2A8">would be co-exi&s;tent and co-equal with the be|nefits they derive from the country, but the events of the late war prove the contrary.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t I apprehend, be deemed by every man who duly con&s;iders the &s;ubject, extremely unwi&s;e and im|politic for the United States to throw &s;uch pecuniary advantages as they have done into the hands of Great Britain, who is a known and avowed enemy to their intere&s;ts and political exi&s;tence, and the continuance of who&s;e peaceable di&s;po&s;ition depending on contin|gencies, cannot be relied upon.</P>
<P>I entertain moreover an opinion that giving &s;o much of the mercantile intere&s;t of the &s;tates as is giv|en into the hands of the Briti&s;h merchants, has had, and will continue to have, an ill influence on the poli|cy of the nation.</P>
<P>In republican governments public mea&s;ures are much under the influence of popular clamour, which is often excited and carried to a great height by men of intrigue. Merchants by their knowledge of men and things&mdash;by the weight which property gives them, and by an influence over the minds of the people in con&s;equence of mercantile connections, dependencies, obligations, acquaintance, &amp;c. are better qualified for, and in fact often do influence the people, and ex|cite popular clamour than any other cla&s;s of men. To give therefore &s;uch a weight and importance to foreigners in the mercantile intere&s;t of the nation as would enable them by intrigue to injure it in its po|litical views and intere&s;ts, is in my humble opinion putting the intere&s;t, tranquility and &s;afety of the U|nited States at too great a hazard.</P>
<P>If my ideas on this point are ju&s;t, and I have fair|ly repre&s;ented it, the que&s;tion which naturally ari&s;es thereupon is, how this &s;tate of the trade of the United States is to be altered and the inconveniencies re&s;ulting therefrom to be remedied? In an&s;wer to which I would ob&s;erve that I would not pretend to determine how
<PB N="56" REF="021774_0055_0FB59E2A0209D1F0">the mea&s;ures which I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t would be con|formable to the treaties of commerce now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the United States and &s;everal nations, but as there is no treaty of commerce between the &s;tates and Great Britain, there can be no legal impedi|ment in the way of it with re&s;pect to that nation. The mea&s;ure I would &s;ugge&s;t in this ca&s;e is that no fo|reigner be permitted to e&s;tabli&s;h a mercantile hou&s;e in the United States or tran&s;act any mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tates, except as a &s;upercargo or tran&s;ient merchant, until he &s;hall have fir&s;t become a citizen agreeable to the laws of naturalization; and that no merchant of the United States be permitted to be connected with any foreign merchant or mercantile hou&s;e, either as a partner, agent or factor.</P>
<P>The ill effects of &s;uch re&s;trictions on account of which objections might be made, I conceive would be that in &s;ome of the &s;tates the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of bu|&s;ine&s;s would be interrupted and the people laid un|der &s;ome inconveniencies in the &s;ale of their produce, and po&s;&s;ibly in the procuring their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies; but I apprehend the&s;e inconveniencies would be but temporary; trade would &s;oon &s;ettle in a regular channel. In tho&s;e &s;tates where there is a deficiency in their native merchants, there are neverthele&s;s men of integrity and knowledge &s;ufficient to tran&s;act all their nece&s;&s;ary mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s, and if &s;uch &s;hould need pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance there are men of property enough in all the &s;tates to &s;upport their commercial it tere&s;ts by affording the nece&s;&s;ary aids to their own merchants &s;hould &s;uch be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The &s;alutary and beneficial effects of &s;uch mea&s;ures would be that the profits acquired by merchandize would be retained in the country; the improvement of American &s;hips in the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s be in|crea&s;ed, and the American merchant, &s;eaman and trade&s;man find employment and &s;upport.</P>

IV. To increa&s;e the circulating property of a nation, is another intention of commerce, and an object in the general regulations of trade.</P>
<P>As the balance of the trade of the United States hath ever, on the whole, been again&s;t them, this max|im or rule, in its application to the commerce of the States, has in view as its fir&s;t object, the turning the balance of trade in their favour.</P>
<P>The balance of trade being again&s;t the United States, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;equences have followed. The circula|ting property having annually been drawn out of the country, has left it de&s;titute of the means of &s;up|plying the national trea&s;ury; has put it out of the power of the debtor to pay his debts; has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed the merchant in the pro&s;ecution of his bu&s;ine&s;s; has reduced real property to trifling con&s;iderations in money, and been the occa&s;ion of throwing a great deal of real property into the hands of foreigners, from whence has aro&s;e an additional prejudicial con&s;equence, which is, that a large &s;um of money is annually drawn out of the States for rents. To turn the balance of trade therefore in favour of the United States, and relieve them from the embarra&s;&s;ments and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which have taken place in con&s;equence of the balance of trade being again&s;t them, is an object of intere&s;ting importance to their welfare, and demands particular attention, and the mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, down to the revolution, there was &s;ome kind of nece&s;&s;ity for a credit in Great Britain; becau&s;e but very few ar|ticles were manufactured, and at various periods, the produce of the country was not &s;ufficient to fur|ni&s;h the people with their nece&s;&s;aries, without &s;uch an anticipation, and as the States were then a part of the Briti&s;h empire, no public injury re&s;ulted there|from. But &s;ince the independency of the States, and the &s;eparation of their intere&s;ts from the intere&s;ts
<PB N="58" REF="021774_0057_0FB59E2CD247CF40">of every other nation, they can depend on no other re&s;ources, but what they find within them&s;elves, to counterbalance the injury which they &s;u&s;tain by &s;uch a &s;tate of their trade.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion therefore very naturally ri&s;es in a con|&s;ideration of this point, nece&s;&s;ary to be determined before we proceed far, and that is, whether the ba|lance of the trade of the United States being again&s;t them at this period, is the effect of nece&s;&s;ity? For, if it be the con&s;equence of an unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity, nothing further need be &s;aid about it; it is an evil which mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to, and borne.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion is to be determined by the deci&s;ion of another, which, though the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, is a little different with re&s;pect to order; and that is, whether the produce of the United States exported to foreign markets, is &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e tho&s;e articles of foreign produce and manufacture, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e and con&s;umption of the peo|ple? It is not in my power at pre&s;ent, to make tho&s;e accurate calculations, which would be nece&s;&s;ary to determine the que&s;tion with preci&s;ion, but from general appearances, and common ob&s;ervations, I think, we cannot mi&s;take in the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>When we come to detach from the u&s;ual importa|tions of the States, articles of luxury and &s;uperfluity in no re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary. Articles which are, and might be produced and manufactured, and tho&s;e which have for years been lying unfold, on which an intere&s;t probably hath annually been paid. And when, in addition to the&s;e we con&s;ider the manu|facturing &s;pirit of late excited in the country, we &s;hall find &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude, that whatever nece&s;&s;ity the country may formerly have been under to anticipate their productions, at this time, the pro|duce which is exported, is &s;ufficient to procure in re|turn, every article of foreign produce and manufac|ture, nece&s;&s;arily wanted by the people, and to leave
<PB N="59" REF="021774_0058_0FB59E2E4B8C38F8">a balance of con&s;iderable con&s;equence. If &s;o, there is no real nece&s;&s;ity for the balance of the trade of the United States being again&s;t them, and con&s;equent|ly no prejudice could ari&s;e to the States, as a nation, or to any individual (except &s;peculators) were their importations, confined within the bounds of their exportations. But even if this was not the ca&s;e, if the exportations of the States were not fully &s;uffi|cient to procure every article which may be &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary, the prejudice done to the common inte|re&s;ts of the nation by incurring an annual debt, is far greater than any inconvenience the people would be laid under, by any &s;mall deficiencies which might happen in their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion ari&s;es, which may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider; What are the principal original cau&s;es of the balance of the trade of the United States be|ing again&s;t them? The cau&s;es, I conceive to be the monopolizing &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h, and the mercen|ary views of the American merchants.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h merchants, well aware of the impor|tance of the commerce of the United States, to the commercial intere&s;t of Great Britain, as &s;oon as peace was re&s;tored to the two countries, in order to be be|fore-hand of the merchants of other nations, and to engro&s;s the trade, immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed mer|cantile hou&s;es in every part of the States, where an e&s;tabli&s;hment could be made to any advantage, of|fering at the &s;ame time, exten&s;ive credit to the Ame|rican merchants. The merchants of the States avail|ed them&s;elves of the&s;e offers, and imported, not only over &s;upplies in nece&s;&s;ary articles, but immen&s;e &s;ums in co&s;tly, &s;uperfluous, and frivolous articles of mer|chandize; &s;o that the country was at once, between them both, over-&s;tocked with nece&s;&s;ary, and unne|ce&s;&s;ary goods.</P>
<P>The inconveniencies, and general injuries attend|ing the fir&s;t exce&s;&s;ive importations after the peace,
<PB N="60" REF="021774_0059_0FB59E352C180278">might have been &s;urmounted, in a great mea&s;ure, before this day, could importers of goods have &s;top|ed where they where, but they could not. Their a&s;&s;ortment of goods &s;oon became broken; a large amount lay unfold; and they were deeply in debt. In order therefore, to pre&s;erve their cu&s;tom, to vend their un&s;aleable goods, and &s;upport their bu&s;ine&s;s un|til events &s;hould enable them to di&s;charge their obli|gations, they have found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of continuing their importations. In con&s;equence of which, the balance of trade hath continued to be again&s;t the States.</P>
<P>The importation of goods on credit, I conceive to be extremely prejudicial to the intere&s;t of the United States in a variety of particular re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The view of the merchant in his importations, having &s;uch an indulgence, is to get what property he can into his hands, in order to enlarge his bu&s;i|ne&s;s; he therefore, never con&s;ults the intere&s;t and nece&s;&s;ity of the people, but their humour and vanity, and accordingly, imports &s;uch articles as he imagines will plea&s;e their fancy, and &s;ell to a profit. Hence it is, that very large amounts in &s;uperfluous and frivo|lous merchandize are annually imported, much be|yond the nece&s;&s;ity and abilities of the people. I know it is often &s;aid, by way of palliation, that the people are under no obligation to purcha&s;e &s;uperfluous and trifling goods, and thereby embarra&s;s their circum|&s;tances, let there be ever &s;o many in the country. This is true, and it is equally true that Eve was un|der no obligation to have received the fruit when offered her. The experience of all countries, and all ages, prove the irre&s;i&s;table power of every kind of temptations. When the merchants therefore, of|fers the people &s;uch kind of goods, as &s;erve to grati|fy a &s;pirit of vanity and o&s;tentation, offers them at low prices and on credit, which he is obliged to do, in order to get them off his hands, it becomes a
<PB N="61" REF="021774_0060_0FB59E39EDB5A900">temptation too mighty to be re&s;i&s;ted; people will accept of the offers, and by that means, contribute to the public embarra&s;&s;ments, by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their own intere&s;ts in &s;uch a manner (in many in&s;tances) that, as the final con&s;equences prove to be, it would have been much better for them&s;elves, and the pub|lic, had &s;uch goods never have been &s;een. 2d. Goods imported on credit, come at an advanced price. The merchants in Europe always in fixing a price on the goods which they fell on credit, con&s;ider the failures that may happen, as well as the difference between credit and prompt payment. This on the quantity of goods imported annually into the United States, amounts to a &s;um of importance. And 3d. As there are but few in&s;tances of punctuality in the di&s;charge of debts due from the merchants of the States, to the merchants in Europe, <HI>intere&s;t</HI> takes place&mdash;com|pound intere&s;t &s;ucceeds, and in many in&s;tances, con|tinued &s;o long, that by the time an account is clo|&s;ed and the debt di&s;charged, twice as much property is exported out, as was imported into the country.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e obviou&s;ly prejudicial cir|cum&s;tances, which attend the importation of goods on credit, it is &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on by many that credit is of advantage, as it facilitates commerce.</P>
<P>There are circum&s;tances, I will admit, which ren|der credit not only <HI>not</HI> prejudicial, but advantageous. Dome&s;tic credit for in&s;tance, is no way detrimental to the intere&s;t of the public, becau&s;e the property &s;till remains in the nation, and it is very often of benefit to the intere&s;t of individuals. Foreign cre|dit al&s;o is of no di&s;advantage, and often of public benefit, provided the property obtained on credit can be, and is improved in the advancement of an inter|e&s;t at home, whereby the debt can be di&s;charged, and a profit &s;aved; or in the pro&s;ecution of &s;ome other foreign bu&s;ine&s;s, productive of advantages &s;uf|ficient to counterbalance the di&s;advantages attending
<PB N="62" REF="021774_0061_0FB59E3D17F77B98">the credit. The balance of the trade of Great Bri|tain with &s;ome nations, is again&s;t her; but, as the property obtained on credit is made u&s;e of, and ap|plied to the advancement of &s;ome profitable intere&s;ts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which a profit is &s;ecured, it is &s;o far from being an injury, that it contributes to national emolument. But to argue from hence, that the United States de|rive an advantage from being credited with European manufactures, which are articles of u&s;e and con&s;ump|tion, which are incapable of improvement, and which are not applied to the advancement of any other pro|fitable intere&s;t; and this credit to a greater amount than the productions of the country for exportation, to me, appears the heighth of ab&s;urdity and fal&s;e rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>From the&s;e brief and de&s;ultory remarks, I think we may rationally draw the following conclu&s;ions, viz. 1&s;t. That the balance of trade being again&s;t the United States, they are (as a natural con&s;equence thereof) greatly embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, both in their public and private intere&s;ts, and therefore, to alter this &s;tate of trade, and turn the balance in fa|vour of the States, the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures of government &s;hould be adopted, together with the patriotic exertions of the people. 2d. The balance of trade again&s;t the &s;tates is not the effect of nece&s;&s;i|ty. Their productions for foreign market being fully &s;ufficient to procure every nece&s;&s;ary article or foreign produce and manufacture. 3d. The balance of trade again&s;t the States, originates in the private, mercenary views of the merchants, and is &s;upported by the vanity of the people. 4th. So long as the Briti&s;h merchants are permitted to introduce whatever kind and quantity of goods they plea&s;e into the States, and the merchants of the States to import goods on credit, without re&s;traint, &s;o long will the balance of trade remain again&s;t them. For the monopoli&s;ing &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h, and the &s;peculating &s;pirit of the
<PB N="63" REF="021774_0062_0FB59E3E17B95D40">American merchants, would forever overrun the re|&s;ources and productions of the country, let them be what they will. And 5th. On the whole we may draw this further conclu&s;ion, that as there are &s;o many powerful, private intere&s;ts and motives oppo&s;ed to the true intere&s;ts of the United States, in their trade, &s;ome decided mea&s;ures become nece&s;&s;ary to confine their imports within the bounds of their exports, and to turn the balance of trade in their favour.</P>
<P>Several mea&s;ures which might be taken would con|duce to this end, and be attended with great and good effects; &s;uch, as the encouragement and &s;up|port of indu&s;try, oeconomy and the u&s;eful arts; a di&s;couragement on the u&s;e of foreign luxuries and &s;uperfluities, and a prohibition on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of foreign mercantile hou&s;es. But after all this, one great cau&s;e of this national evil would &s;till remain. Suppo&s;e then (I propo&s;e it as a matter of que&s;tion) the national legi&s;lature &s;hould pa&s;s an act of this na|ture, viz. that from and after the term of five years, no debt contracted in Europe, for any kind of manufactures, &s;hould be recoverable by law in the United States? What would be the probable effects of &s;uch a law? Would it not &s;timulate the people to exertions in the manufacturing bu&s;ine&s;s? Would it not excite tho&s;e who are concerned in the European trade, to make &s;uch preparations and arrangements, as to admit of the operation of the law without in|convenience? And would not the idea of &s;uch a law taking place at a fixed time, produce &s;uch exer|tions and preparations, as to render the execution of it unnece&s;&s;ary? I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch would be the effects, and I &s;hould imagine al&s;o, that no preju|dice of either a public, or private nature would take place in con&s;equence of it. For I think every man who con&s;iders the &s;ubject with any degree of atten|tion, mu&s;t be convinced that the productions of the country are &s;ufficient, and more than &s;ufficient to
<PB N="64" REF="021774_0063_0FB59E429270CB70">procure the people every nece&s;&s;ary of foreign manu|facture, and that all that is nece&s;&s;ary to reduce the importations of the States, within the circumfe|rence of their exportations is, to alter the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of the mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whether &s;uch a law in fact, would be the mo&s;t elegible and proper to an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es, I will not take upon my&s;elf to determine; but I would ob&s;erve, that a de&s;perate political evil, like a natural di&s;order, requires a de&s;perate remedy, and on that ground, if no other, ju&s;tifiable. To turn the balance of trade in favour of the United States, is a matter of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the future welfare of the nation; and could this point be once fixed, importations re&s;trained within the compa&s;s of exportations, it would lay a foundation for the rapid increa&s;e of national wealth: For, if the States could once get rid of the expence of advance prices on their goods imported, of an intere&s;t which is annual|ly added, and of the inconveniencies which they &s;uf|fer on account of the &s;ums of money which are an|nually drawn out for the rent of real property. If, in con&s;equence of &s;uch re&s;traints, the exertions and oeconomy of the people &s;hould render a foreign credit unnece&s;&s;ary; and the merchants were to ar|range their bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a manner as to export the produce of the States to the mo&s;t advantageous markets; to purcha&s;e returns of the nece&s;&s;ary kinds, at the lowe&s;t prices, and with the fewe&s;t incidental expences, the advantages would not &s;top at any one point, but be continually progre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there are other mea&s;ures which would tend to increa&s;e the wealth of the nation. One of which is, to &s;ecure the benefit of the freighting bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as far as it can be done con&s;i&s;tent with the ex|i&s;ting treaties of commerce, and the circum&s;tances of the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="021774_0064_0FB59E455369BA00">
A nation derives many benefits from commerce, but all the real profit which accrues by its trade, con&s;i&s;ts in the freights made by its ve&s;&s;els; the ad|vantage which a merchant makes in the &s;ale of the produce of the country in foreign markets, is &s;eldom more than &s;ufficient to pay the freight and incidental charges; and the profits which he makes on returns are drawn from the people and not from any other nation. It adds nothing to the common &s;tock; but freights outward, admitting a cargo, &s;ells for &s;uffici|ent profit to pay the freight, which is always to be &s;uppo&s;ed are drawn from the con&s;uming nation and becomes an accumulation of wealth to the nation the ve&s;&s;el freighted belongs to; and freights home, if by the ve&s;&s;els belonging to the importing nation altho' they are ultimately drawn from the people, yet the amount is retained; whereas if freights home are performed by foreign ve&s;&s;els, the amount is drawn out and goes to the emolument of a foreign nation. The freighting bu&s;ine&s;s therefore is an object of con|&s;equence to the United States and merits particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>From a fal&s;e idea of freedom in trade, and con&s;i|dering it as the foundation of national wealth, the &s;tates have thrown the doors of their commerce open to all nations without limitation or re&s;triction, the con&s;equence of which hath been the lo&s;s of freights to their ve&s;&s;els, together with all the e&s;&s;ential advantages of commerce. The United States have given greater indulgencies to foreigners in their trade than (I believe) are granted by any other nation. They permit a foreign &s;hip to freight into their ports cargoes not only of the growth, produce and manu|facture of the nation or country to which they belong but of any other nation whatever. They permit al|&s;o foreign &s;hips to freight out not only to the nation to which &s;uch &s;hips belong and their dependencies, but to any other nation or country, whereby the trade
<PB N="66" REF="021774_0065_0FB59E46A0FFEFE0">to divers free ports opened for the reception of Ame|rican produce and the benefit of the United States, hath fallen into the hands of foreign, particularly Bri|ti&s;h merchants, in a con&s;iderable degree, and become a new acqui&s;ition to the commerce of Great Britain. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the &s;tates have indulged the Briti&s;h na|tion &s;o far in its illiberal and monopolizing humour as to permit it an unlimited, undefined and exclu&s;ive right to the enjoyment of all the advantages and emo|luments of the trade between the United States and the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Upon a conjectural calculation the freights between the United States and the Briti&s;h dominions in Ame|rica, amount to more than 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually, and from the &s;outhern ports three quarters of the freights between this country and Europe is performed by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, together with a large proportion out of the northern &s;tates. One third of the value of the produce thus freighted probably goes to the emo|lument of Great Britain under the denomination of freight, in&s;urance and incidental charges.</P>
<P>To retain the advantages of the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s and to render it one means of increa&s;ing the wealth of the nation in &s;uch ways and methods as in the be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible manner would accommodate the in|tere&s;ts and circum&s;tances of the different &s;tates, will I conceive, be attended with no &s;mall difficulty, for which rea&s;on I feel a diffidence in &s;aying any thing on the &s;ubject; but as I have begun, I will proceed and give you my thoughts thereon; and in order to come at the mo&s;t rational conclu&s;ions on this point, I would &s;tate two or three facts.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The United States have not &s;hips at pre&s;ent &s;ufficient to freight the whole of their productions to market: but with what &s;hips they already have they might freight much more than they do; and in three years time they might increa&s;e the number of their &s;hips to &s;uch a degree as to be able to freight the
<PB N="67" REF="021774_0066_0FB59E4930C8A9A8">whole of their produce &s;hould &s;ufficient encourage|ment and &s;upport be given.</P>
<P N="2">2d. There are American &s;hips already built &s;uffici|ent to freight into the United States every article of foreign produce and manufacture nece&s;&s;ary for the people; and this &s;ervice they would perform were it &s;ecured to them, at lea&s;t as far as treaties of commerce would admit of.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands, Bermuda, &amp;c. are dependent on the United States for many of their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. This dependence is founded in nature, and will exi&s;t as long as the countries exi&s;t.</P>
<P>From this brief &s;tatement of a few facts I would ob|&s;erve, 1&s;t. That as there are not at this time Ameri|can &s;hips &s;ufficient to freight the whole of the produce of the United States to the European markets, I con|ceive it would not be to the general intere&s;t to prohi|bit the freighting of foreign &s;hips, and I am much at a lo&s;s to determine in my own mind, what judicious mea&s;ure could be adopted, to give a proper prefer|ence to American &s;hips in the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s. If any extraordinary impo&s;itions &s;hould be laid on Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, it would only produce retaliating mea&s;ures, and if a tax was laid on the freighter of a Briti&s;h &s;hip, it would be a real hard&s;hip in all &s;uch ca&s;es, where American &s;hips could not be obtained; &s;o that it appears to me, no po&s;itive preference by law can with propriety, or to public advantage be given. It mu&s;t, I think, be left to the patrioti&s;m, and at the option of the people. But I conceive, &s;uch regula|tions as tend to de&s;troy tho&s;e connections which blend the commercial intere&s;ts of Great Britain, with tho&s;e of the United States, and to give the mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s into the hands of the merchants of the States, would at the &s;ame time, de&s;troy the original cau&s;e of the great preference and employment which has been given to Briti&s;h &s;hips, in the trade between the two nations. American merchants, having no
<PB N="68" REF="021774_0067_0FB59E50E3FA28C8">connections of intere&s;t with the merchants of Great Britain, would naturally give a preference to Ame|rican &s;hips. An impo&s;ition of duties on Briti&s;h &s;hips I conceive, ought to be regulated by the laws of Great Britain; for extraordinary impo&s;itions and their con&s;equent retaliations, have neither end nor bounds.</P>
<P>One mea&s;ure which appears nece&s;&s;ary to be adopt|ed is, that Briti&s;h &s;hips from Great Britain, or Ire|land, &s;hould be permitted to freight out of the United States to tho&s;e kingdoms only, and to no where el&s;e; becau&s;e, if they are permitted to freight even to their own American dominions, it would de&s;troy the effect of &s;uch regulations, as I apprehend, will be found nece&s;&s;ary, re&s;pecting the trade between the States and the Briti&s;h dominions in America; and becau&s;e by circum&s;cribing the freights of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in &s;uch a manner, other freights, which are now taken up by tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, will be re&s;erved for the ve&s;&s;els of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2d. As the United States have now, and proba|bly always will have ve&s;&s;els &s;ufficient to freight into them every nece&s;&s;ary foreign production, the freights of foreign ve&s;&s;els into the United States, &s;hould be confined to the produce and manufactures of tho&s;e nations, to which they re&s;pectively belong. This would give &s;ome advantage to the navigation and trade of the States; for hitherto, foreign, particularly Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, have freighted quantities of merchan|dize from various ports of other nations, whereby the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s of the States is greatly injured and not only the freighting intere&s;t in particular, but the mercantile intere&s;t in general; for, by this in|dulgence, &s;uch quantities of many kinds of merchan|dize are at times introduced, as to reduce their price and render them un&s;aleable, whereby the merchants &s;uffer great inconveniencies, and heavy damages.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="021774_0068_0FB59E53D2C15C70">
It is thought by many, I am &s;en&s;ible, that a great influx of goods into a country, and their con&s;equent low prices, is of public benefit. For my own part I think otherwi&s;e. The diminution of the prices of goods, is the occa&s;ion of a proportional larger con&s;umption, very often to the extreme of licenciou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;o that it &s;eldom happens, that the amount of the general expenditures of a nation, is much le&s;&s;en|ed by goods being &s;old at a reduced price. Be&s;ides, the merchant mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially injured thereby, which I conceive is as prejudicial to the intere&s;t of a nation to do, as to injure the agricultural, or manu|facturing intere&s;t. With equal propriety, might the merchant and mechanic affirm, that the intere&s;t of the nation was promoted by the value of the produc|tions of the field being reduced in &s;uch a manner, that the hu&s;bandman could not &s;upport and keep his intere&s;t good, as that the hu&s;bandman &s;hould a&s;&s;ert the nation was growing rich, becau&s;e imported goods were &s;o reduced in price, that in con&s;equence of it the merchant could not &s;upport this bu&s;ine&s;s. The mercantile intere&s;t is of importance to a nation, and equally a &s;upport to agriculture and manufactures, as they are to commerce. Tho&s;e foreign &s;ources there|fore of our &s;upplies, whereby the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els of the United States is interfered with, and the merchants injured in the &s;ale and price of their merchandize, I conceive ought to be cut off by prohibiting the importation of the produce and manu|facture of any foreign nation or country, by a foreign ve&s;&s;el, except tho&s;e that belong to the nation where &s;uch commodities are produced and manufactured.</P>
<P N="3">3d. As the Briti&s;h i&s;lands in America are depen|dent on the United States for a variety of their ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and as this dependence is founded in the nature of things, the States undoubtedly, have it in their power to pre&s;cribe the mode in which they &s;hall obtain &s;upplies from hence. If Great Britain
<PB N="70" REF="021774_0069_0FB59E554288B650">&s;hould continue to refu&s;e a treaty of commerce, and the admi&s;&s;ion of American ve&s;&s;els into tho&s;e ports, the States would have a right, as well as good rea|&s;on, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as eventually to produce a treaty, or &s;ecure to them&s;elves equal advantages in the trade.</P>
<P>Should the United States prohibit the exportation of tho&s;e articles of produce, which are &s;uitable for the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India markets, in Briti&s;h bottoms, I apprehend they would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring their &s;upplies from tho&s;e ports, where American produce in American ve&s;&s;els are permit|ted. This was their mode of obtaining &s;upplies be|fore the la&s;t prohibitory orders of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were i&s;&s;ued, and had it not been for the imbecility of the American government, they never would have been given; or if given, would not have taken effect. And I conceive it to be a matter of very little or no con&s;equence to the commerce of the States, whether they freight their produce to, and deliver it in St. Eu&s;tatius, or St. Chri&s;tophers, a freight is equally &s;ecured, which is the great object.</P>
<P>But, as the &s;outhern States make a great depen|dence on Briti&s;h merchants and ve&s;&s;els, to purcha&s;e and carry off their produce, and as a total prohibi|tion in this ca&s;e might lay them under &s;ome tempo|rary inconveniencies, I would &s;ugge&s;t, whether to lay Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t-Indies, &amp;c. under the &s;ame re&s;trictions that are laid on American ve&s;&s;els going to Turk's-I&s;land for &s;alt, could not be proper, and as well adapted to the intere&s;t and circum&s;tances of the States, as any mea&s;ure that would be propo|&s;ed. An American ve&s;&s;el is admitted at Turk's-I&s;land in balla&s;t only, paying a tonnage of two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence &s;terling.</P>
<P>I apprehend, if &s;uch a re&s;olution &s;hould be laid, &s;ome ve&s;&s;els would import money for the purcha&s;e of their cargoes; at the &s;ame time, it would dimini&s;h
<PB N="71" REF="021774_0070_0FB59E57836FBAF0">the number of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the American trade, and open a door for the introduction of American ve&s;&s;els into the bu&s;ine&s;s, without producing any imme|diate con&s;equences, which might be the ca&s;e, &s;hould the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s be violently, or &s;ud|denly interrupted.</P>
<P>It is, that the full effects of &s;uch a re&s;triction might be produced, that I conceive Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from Great Britain and Ireland, &s;hould not be permitted to freight out of the States to the We&s;t-Indies, &amp;c.&mdash; Again,</P>
<P>It appears to me to be extremely impolitic, and much again&s;t the intere&s;t of the United States, to contribute to the &s;upport of rival intere&s;ts, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have hitherto done.</P>
<P>Nova-Scotia is &s;o &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced, that it is capable of rivaling the United States, in their &s;hip-building and whale-fi&s;hery, with the &s;upports which it derives from them; but without &s;uch &s;up|ports, I conceive, tho&s;e intere&s;ts would never flouri&s;h in that province.</P>
<P>Ship-building in the United States, both for their own &s;ervice, and foreign markets, is an object of importance, and an intere&s;t, which merits &s;upport and protection: They cannot therefore, with any rea&s;on, or regard to their own intere&s;t, &s;upply the deficiencies of other nations or States, in &s;uch a man|ner, as to enable them to prejudice this intere&s;t. Nova-Scotia has &s;ome advantages, and natural re|&s;ources, well adapted to the intere&s;t of &s;hip-building, yet, it is dependent for iron, carpenters and provi&s;ions, particularly flour, for the &s;upport of this, as well as other intere&s;ts. Some carpenters, and &s;ome provi|&s;ion may be had from Great-Britian and Ireland; but iron, and a full &s;upply of carpenters, as well as provi&s;ions, are drawn from the States.</P>
<P>The States it is true derive &s;ome pre&s;ent advantages from &s;upplying Nova-Scotia with provi&s;ions and iron;
<PB N="72" REF="021774_0071_0FB59E58FA0C8CC8">and it may be a matter of que&s;tion, whether the ad|vantages or di&s;advantages are the greater? To this I would ob&s;erve, 1&s;t. That Nova-Scotia is a neigh|bouring rival power, and its inimical di&s;po&s;ition to|wards the States avowed, and univer&s;ally known. To contribute therefore to the increa&s;e of this power, and render it the more able to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;turbing the tran|quility, and endangering the &s;afety of the States, ap|pears to me to be impolitic, and of &s;ufficient weight to &s;upercede con&s;iderations of a trifling pecuniary ad|vantage. 2d. If &s;hip building in Nova-Scotia does not exceed its own &s;ervice and employment, no pre|judice will re&s;ult to the States therefrom: But if by the &s;upplies of carpenters and provi&s;ion received from the States, the price of labour &s;hould be &s;o reduced as to enable that province to build cheaper, and ob|tain a preference on that account in the &s;ale of &s;hips, the States would be prejudiced, and for that rea&s;on &s;hould prohibit &s;uch &s;upports. This however, on the whole, con&s;idered independent of and detached from other intere&s;ts, might admit of a doubt in the minds of &s;ome; but when we add to this the whale fi&s;hery, which flouri&s;hes in Nova-Scotia, by the &s;upports in men and provi&s;ion received from the States, I think it mu&s;t manife&s;tly appear that the intere&s;ts of the United States are injured by the &s;upplies afforded to that province.</P>
<P>The whale fi&s;hery is an intere&s;t of importance to the States: It employs a great number of people; produces a con&s;iderable annual &s;um out of the &s;ea, and always hath brought into the country large &s;ums in money. The little i&s;land of Nantucket, unimpor|tant in it&s;elf, contributes as largely to the wealth of the nation as any &s;pot of ground of its bigne&s;s in the United States, perhaps more &s;o. It hath formerly employed about two hundred fail of ve&s;&s;els; &s;upport|ed from four to five thou&s;and inhabitants, and pro|duced at a moderate computation, about forty thou|&s;and
<PB N="73" REF="021774_0072_0FB59E62BAE93510">pounds &s;terling annually, wholly by this bu&s;ine&s;s. At pre&s;ent the bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o great, but is increa&s;ing; and might with &s;uitable encouragements and &s;upports arrive at and exceed its former importance.</P>
<P>Great-Britain before the revolution was the be&s;t, and indeed the only market this country had for its oil. But in order to &s;uppre&s;s the intere&s;t of the States, and to &s;upport Nova-Scotia in its rivalry, Great-Britain, &s;ince the peace, has charged oil imported from the States with &s;uch a heavy duty, as to render the mar|ket unprofitable. The continuation of this impo&s;i|tion; and other di&s;couragements on the con&s;umption of oil imported from the States into Great-Britain, I apprehend, depends principally on one circum&s;tance, which is this; If the whaling bu&s;ine&s;s in Nova-Scotia &s;hould bid fair to arrive at &s;omething of con&s;equence, the&s;e di&s;couragements will be continued; but if it &s;hould dwindle into in&s;ignificance, they will be re|moved; for Great-Britain, if I am not mi&s;taken, is under a nece&s;&s;ity of completing its &s;upply of oil from America; at lea&s;t I know of no other foreign re|&s;ources. And whether the whale fi&s;hery in Nova-Scotia flouri&s;hes or not, I apprehend depends on the views and mea&s;ures of the States. Should they pro|hibit the exportation of provi&s;ion, and the emigration of whalemen to Nova-Scotia, I conceive it would re|duce it to a &s;tate of unimportance.</P>
<P>Some provi&s;ion it produces, and &s;ome it may im|port from Europe; but the&s;e &s;upplies are precarious and inadequate to the &s;upport of a great number of &s;eamen and mechanics. Flour in a particular manner in Nova-Scotia is dependent on the States for. And,</P>
<P>The knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute the whale fi&s;hery to advantage, is on this &s;ide the Atlantic, con|fined to the people of the United States. Without a &s;upport in whalemen from the States, Nova-Scotia would fail in this bu&s;ine&s;s. It is now carried on by the people from the States, and for its future &s;upport
<PB N="74" REF="021774_0073_0FB59E65C8632010">and increa&s;e every artifice is made u&s;e of to draw whalemen away to that province.</P>
<P>Whether it would be to the intere&s;t and advantage of the States to &s;top the&s;e &s;upplies, may be fully de|termined, I conceive, by one con&s;ideration only.</P>
<P>The only advantage the States derive from &s;up|porting the whale fi&s;hery in Nova-Scotia, con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ale of a little provi&s;ion. Let us &s;ee what this amounts to. If that bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould fail in Nova-Scotia, a great part of the whalemen now employed there would probably return again to the States. The con&s;ump|tion of provi&s;ion would therefore be &s;till the &s;ame. Be&s;ides, a whaleman's annual indu&s;try may be com|puted to amount, on an average, at thirty pounds &s;terling; his con&s;umption of provi&s;ion at not more than ten pounds. The States therefore would ac|quire twenty pounds benefit by every whaleman &s;up|ported in them, which they deprive them&s;elves of by &s;upporting them in Nova-Scotia. From this con&s;i|deration it is evident that the United States injure them&s;elves much, in contributing to the &s;upport of the whaling bu&s;ine&s;s in Nova-Scotia. And on the whole, when we con&s;ider the amount of the benefits that the States derive from the &s;upplies which they afford to Nova-Scotia, in mechanics, whalemen, pro|vi&s;ions, &amp;c. and on the other hand, the prejudices re&s;ulting therefrom to the intere&s;ts of the States, by their rivalry in the whale fi&s;hery, and in &s;hip build|ing; and in con&s;equence thereof, the increa&s;e of a neighbouring inimical power, we &s;hall find the ad|vantages to bear no proportion to the di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>The United States, it is true, have no right to in|terfere with the advantages which Nova-Scotia de|rives from its government, &s;ituation and natural re|&s;ources; but they undoubtedly have a good right to withhold &s;uch &s;upports as would enable Nova-Scotia to injure them.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="021774_0074_0FB59E67483C2B68">
Be&s;ides the&s;e, Nova-Scotia derives other &s;upports from the United States, which I conceive is prejudi|cial to their intere&s;ts. Fi&s;h of all kinds have been im|ported into the United States from that province: This is manife&s;tly wrong, becau&s;e it deprives the cod fi&s;hery of the United States (which is an impor|tant intere&s;t) of &s;o much &s;upport that ought to be given it, and contributes to the &s;upport of a foreign intere&s;t, for which no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned. The im|portation of fi&s;h therefore of every kind from any fo|reign nation or country into the United States, I con|ceive &s;hould be prohibited.</P>
<P>The We&s;t-India trade al&s;o, of Nova-Scotia, is greatly &s;upported by the United States, particularly by the &s;upplies of lumber which it receives from them. This is impolitic, becau&s;e every cargo of lumber furni&s;hed Nova-Scotia, deprives the States of a freight. But this will probably be con&s;idered in the regulations of trade between the United States and the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands. If it &s;hould be found proper to admit Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t-Indies, Bermuda, &amp;c. in balla&s;t only, for the purpo&s;e of taking cargoes out of the States for tho&s;e i&s;lands, the &s;ame rea&s;ons for this permi&s;&s;ion I do not think will hold good with re|&s;pect to the &s;upplying Nova-Scotia with cargoes for the &s;upport of its navigation, becau&s;e it interferes with the navigation of the United States. In &s;hort, as the United States want nothing from Nova-Scotia, and Nova-Scotia wants nothing from them, but what in point of intere&s;t or policy is injurious to &s;upply them with, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on for continuing any com|mercial intercour&s;e with that province.</P>
<P>Furthermore&mdash;The States have a rival in their na|vigation, where from the natural &s;tate of things, it could not have been expected.</P>
<P>Formerly the States were carriers for the We&s;t-India I&s;lands; but the table is now turned, and the We&s;t-Indies have become carriers for the States; and
<PB N="76" REF="021774_0075_0FB59E68DCEA5FD0">from the &s;upport which the Briti&s;h merchants receive by the &s;ole enjoyment and benefit of the trade be|tween the two countries, they are enabled not only to purcha&s;e and improve, but to build ve&s;&s;els. Many have already been built, and many more are on hand.</P>
<P>This is an object worthy of attention; for it would be much again&s;t the true intere&s;t of the States, and contrary to the natural order of things, for them to contribute to the &s;upport of &s;hip building, and the intere&s;t of navigation in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P N="5">V. A ba&s;is on which to e&s;tabli&s;h a national reve|nue, is one public advantage of commerce; and a material object in the general regulations of trade.</P>
<P>Much money is required by all governments for national &s;ervices. The &s;afety and welfare of the nation, and a due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, cannot be provided for and &s;upported without. And although individuals may, and often do grudge the money they pay to the public, and con&s;ider it a kind of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o much money thrown away; yet, they &s;hould con&s;i|der that the &s;ecurity and &s;upport of private intere&s;t, depends on the &s;upport and protection of the general intere&s;ts of the nation; and therefore, whatever mo|ney is required for and applied to the&s;e purpo&s;es, is but a contribution to the private intere&s;t of indivi|duals.</P>
<P>Did the people rightly con&s;ider this; did they thoroughly under&s;tand the intimate connection and mutual dependence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the general in|tere&s;t of the nation, and the private intere&s;t of indi|viduals, it would reconcile them to the nece&s;&s;ary re|gulations of commerce, and to any judicious &s;y&s;tem of revenue which was calculated to draw money from them for public &s;ervices, upon principles of ju&s;tice and equality, and in eligible rational modes.</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary that the demands of government be proportionate to the abilities of the people, and the quantity of money in the nation. If a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
<PB N="77" REF="021774_0076_0FB59E70E59D9F98">no money, it is certain none can be collected&mdash;if there are but five millions of dollars among the peoples, it would be in vain to require ten millions. If the rich only have money, the rich only are to be applied to. Government in &s;hort, mu&s;t require money from tho&s;e who have it, and that in proportion to the quantity which the people may be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. And it is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o that government &s;hould rai&s;e money from the people in &s;uch modes, and by &s;uch methods as are equitable, eligible, and not oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>This country in mo&s;t of its parts has been accu&s;|tomed to rai&s;e public money by a direct tax on real property, which, when the expences of government were &s;mall, and the taxes but trifling, the oppre&s;&s;ive nature of this mode was &s;carcely felt by any; but &s;ince the expences of the United States have aro&s;e to a con|&s;iderable magnitude, it has operated with great ine|quality, and in many in&s;tances, extremely oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>That the people &s;hould pay in proportion to the real and vi&s;ible property which they re&s;pectively po&s;|&s;e&s;s, appears to be a fundamental and governing prin|ciple in the doctrine of taxation, without con&s;idering whether it is competent, or more than competent to the original de&s;ign of property, which is the comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;upport of the proprietor and his family. Every man is entitled to this benefit from his property, in preference to every other con&s;idera|tion. If this be ju&s;t, it will follow as a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence, that to lay a heavy tax on the property of tho&s;e who derive no other benefit from it than a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that perhaps not a comfortable one, is oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing on &s;uch individuals. Whe|ther it be ju&s;t or unovoidable is a matter of further con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of mo&s;t countries, are, with re&s;pect to property, divided into three cla&s;&s;es: The rich, the middling, and the poor.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="021774_0077_0FB59E7408DE89D0">
The rich are enabled to live in ea&s;e, and add no|thing to the wealth of a nation by their own labour; and in proportion to the value of their property, are able to add an annual &s;um to their original &s;tock, be|&s;ides &s;upporting them&s;elves and families in affluence. The rich however, are not a u&s;ele&s;s unimportant cla&s;s of citizens. They are able to e&s;tabli&s;h and carry on many kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s of public advantage and utility, which tho&s;e in middling or low circum&s;tances could not do. But at the &s;ame time, the immediate advan|tages and profits of &s;uch kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s go to the emolument of the rich man. The rich al&s;o are of ad|vantage to the public, as they are enabled to give em|ployment and &s;upport to the poor&mdash;tho&s;e who have nothing to depend on for a livelihood but their labour. But then, the property of the rich derives as great or greater advantage from the labours of the poor, as the poor acquire to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The middling cla&s;s of people, tho&s;e who have &s;ome &s;mall property, by their indu&s;try and frugality pro|cure a &s;upport for them&s;elves and families&mdash;&s;ome but a &s;canty&mdash;&s;ome a comfortable &s;upport, and &s;ome per|haps may add a &s;mall &s;um to their property annually. This cla&s;s of the people are the mo&s;t numerous, and promote the wealth and &s;trength of a nation, by cultiva|ting and improving the face of the country, and by po|pulating it with a hardy race of indu&s;trious citizens, while in general, the only benefit they derive from their property and labour, is a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The poor, as they are wholly dependent on the rich for employment, &s;o the rich have it always in their power to fix the price of the labour of the poor; and if we con&s;ider the condition of the rich, and take the trouble of looking into the hou&s;es of the poor; ob&s;erve their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, their clothing and general mode of living, we &s;hall find convincing evidence, that the profitable parts of the labour of the poor are accumulated by the rich.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="021774_0078_0FB59E7588428080">
If this be a ju&s;t repre&s;entation; if the middling cla&s;s of the people accumulate little or no wealth by their property and labour, and if the profits of the labour of the poor are accumulated in one way, and in an|other by the rich, then I think it may be rationally concluded, that on the principles of ju&s;tice, the rich are to be applied to by government for money, for the &s;ervices of the public, to the relief, if not to the exoneration of the other cla&s;&s;es of the people.</P>
<P>There are many within the compa&s;s of my know|ledge who have a &s;mall property, which to be taxed in proportion to the property of many rich people, ac|cording to the common rules of apportionment, would produce a con&s;iderable &s;um, equal in &s;ome in&s;tances to what is received from many other people worth ten times as much. This is unavoidable in the common modes of taxation; for no general rule can be de|vi&s;ed, to apply to the various kinds and different va|lue of property with equality; and &s;ome kinds of property in &s;ome circum&s;tances cannot be touched. Such modes therefore which operate with inequality, and are productive of di&s;tre&s;s on particular cla&s;&s;es of the people, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as erroneous in their principles; and &s;uch I conceive are the modes of tax|ation generally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the States.</P>
<P>To more fully explain and illu&s;trate my ideas on this point, I will propo&s;e a ca&s;e which I believe is much more than a &s;uppo&s;eable one.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> has a property in lands and &s;tock of the value of five hundred pounds, on which a tax is laid of ten pounds. This property with his own labour pro|duces a comfortable &s;upport for him&s;elf and family, and nothing more, which we will &s;uppo&s;e amounts to one hundred pounds. <HI>B.</HI> has a property of the &s;ame kind, worth five thou&s;and pounds, on which a tax is laid in the &s;ame proportion of one hundred pounds. This property, with an equal proportion of labour, will produce one thou&s;and pounds, which is nine
<PB N="80" REF="021774_0079_0FB59E77013FAFD8">hundred pounds more than &s;ufficient to &s;upport his family, in the manner <HI>A.</HI> &s;upports his. The addi|tional expence of labour, nece&s;&s;ary to be performed on the larger e&s;tate, we will compute at four hun|dred pounds, which leaves a nett profit of five hun|dred pounds. From this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, which I believe is ju&s;t, it appears that <HI>B.</HI> could pay five hun|dred and ten pounds into the public trea&s;ury, with as little prejudice to his intere&s;t, as <HI>A.</HI> could ten pounds. But, by the common rules of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, he pays only one hundred pounds, by which <HI>A.</HI> &s;inks ten pounds of his property annually, and <HI>B.</HI> adds four hundred pounds to his. This is the general operation of the common modes of taxation, and methods of rai&s;ing money for public &s;ervices, adopted by mo&s;t or all the States, which on account of their inequality and op|pre&s;&s;ive con&s;equences in their application, ought to be condemned.</P>
<P>There is an in&s;tance which occurs that further il|lu&s;trates this point, and in my mind places it in a &s;triking point of light. This was the &s;inkage of the continental money.</P>
<P>I think it mu&s;t appear evident to every one, that had that money been &s;unk by a tax on real property, in the common modes of taxation, the property of &s;even-eights of the people, or at at lea&s;t a very great proportion, would have fallen into the hands of the other eighth: But by its &s;inking as it did, tho&s;e peo|ple who had acquired it by exorbitant profits, without affecting their real property, paid it without being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Some in&s;tances it is true there were of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion taking place, in con&s;equence of the depreciation and final &s;inkage of that money; but the&s;e were &s;o few in compari&s;on with what would have happened by its being &s;unk by a tax on property, that on the whole it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t ju&s;t and eligible mode that could have been devi&s;ed to pay that debt.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="021774_0080_0FB59E80D61F6808">
Becau&s;e therefore, no general rule of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment can be &s;o calculated as to apply with propriety and equali|ty to the property of the people, without producing numberle&s;s in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s; the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;orting to other methods of rai&s;ing pub|lic monies, appears obvious; and among other pro|per ways and means, a tax on articles of importation is evidently one. By this, application is made di|rectly to the pockets of the rich; the amount of the money paid to the public is optional and voluntary; the effect is not &s;en&s;ibly felt; and it is al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;ummary, eligible and &s;ure method of collecting mo|ney for the &s;ervices of the nation.</P>
<P>A tax of this kind, and to be con&s;idered by go|vernment, as its principal re&s;ource would, in my humble opinion, go farther towards the peaceable and firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new form of govern|ment, than all the revi&s;ions and amendments, which could render the con&s;titution more perfectly agreea|ble to the ideas of the opponents; for I know of no|thing more really feared by the mo&s;t numerous part of the people, than heavy taxes on their property, and for this rea&s;on with others, I conceive the go|vernment will con&s;ider an impo&s;t, with the addition of an exci&s;e, its principal, if not only re&s;ource, and never attempt a land tax, except in ca&s;es of &s;pecial emergency.</P>
<P>But, as an impo&s;t on foreign articles imported into the United States, may, and I conceive, ought to be &s;o calculated, as to an&s;wer a variety of benefi|cial purpo&s;es be&s;ides &s;upplying the national trea&s;ury, which I at fir&s;t took notice of; I would beg leave to explain and illu&s;trate my ideas thereon, by enu|merating a number of imported articles, annexing thereunto a proportion of duties, upon the principle. I have all along proceeded upon.</P>

<P>In this enumeration and arrangement, I have not aimed at preci&s;ion, or a great degree of certainty and regularity. What I had principally in view, was to explain my own ideas, re&s;pecting the purpo&s;es a duty on articles of importation may be calculated to an&s;wer, which are 1&s;t. To draw money from the rich and opulent for public u&s;es. 2d. To le&s;&s;en the two general u&s;e of luxurious, unnece&s;&s;ary and trifling articles of foreign production. And 3d. to encourage and &s;upport the manufacturing intere&s;t of the United States.</P>
<P>Neither have I aimed at a full and complete enu|meration, nor am I po&s;itive with re&s;pect to the pro|priety of the arrangment, for I do not think my information, relative to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the manu|factures, is competent to determine with certainty the rate, or amount of duties which would be pro|per to be laid on &s;everal articles in order to give the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport, and at the &s;ame time, the be&s;t adapted to the circum&s;tances of the people. But I conceive, a duty on articles of importation, formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed on the principles here held forth, would be productive of e&s;&s;ential advantages to the intere&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>The adoption of the ideas here &s;ugge&s;ted, in form|ing a &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce, may proba|bly, with &s;ufficient rea&s;on be found, on examination to be improper. They may prove to be ab&s;urd; or if not ab&s;olutely ab&s;urd, yet objectionable, on many
<PB N="84" REF="021774_0083_0FB59E8565371D68">accounts, particularly as they may appear to have a tendency to circum&s;cribe commerce within too nar|row limits. For my own part, I have no idea of circum&s;cribing trade (properly directed) with regard to its extent, but of confining it to proper channels, and directing it to proper objects; and if I have mi&s;|took the mo&s;t &s;uitable mea&s;ures to an&s;wer the&s;e pur|po&s;es, I have mi&s;&s;ed my intention. But I mu&s;t as yet, continue to think it a mi&s;taken idea which many entertain, that trade is the foundation of national wealth, and that to extend it to extreme lengths, and carry it on in every po&s;&s;ible way in which it may be pro&s;ecuted, promotes the intere&s;t of the nation, or finally will promote the intere&s;t of individuals.</P>
<P>Agriculture and manufactures, I con&s;ider as the &s;ources and foundation of national wealth. Com|merce the handmaid, or medium, by which the &s;ur|plus productions of agriculture and manufactures are turned to the be&s;t account, and rendered in the highe&s;t degree advantageous and profitable. Com|merce therefore, cannot exceed the bounds which agriculture and manufactures may affix, without in|juring the general intere&s;t of the nation, and without prejudicing the intere&s;t of the merchants.</P>
<P>The United States, &s;ince the revolution, have fully experienced the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of trade, and can witne&s;s the ruinous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;equences of it. They, as a nation, have &s;uffered a great diminution of property; and if we con&s;ider the number of bankruptcies, the langui&s;hing &s;tate of trade, and the great complaints of the merchants throughout the States, we &s;hall find &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude, that but very few have made trade as beneficial to them&s;elves as their hopes flattered them it would.</P>
<P>Such a regulation of trade therefore as will tend to re&s;train its licentious operations, as will tend to &s;up|port the mercantile, agricultural and manufacturing intere&s;ts of the United States and render it &s;ub&s;ervient
<PB N="85" REF="021774_0084_0FB59E8B9D5AE868">on the whole to the general welfare of the nation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily promote the particular intere&s;t of tho&s;e who are concerned in trade.</P>
<P>Foreign merchants and &s;peculators may be fru&s;tra|ted in their views thereby, but I conceive that to be a con&s;ideration not of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to the in|tere&s;t of the United States, to &s;uper&s;ede con&s;iderations and mea&s;ures of national utility and advantage.</P>
<P>Speculators belonging to the &s;tates, and tho&s;e who are inclined to quit a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they have been educated in order to commence merchants and tra|ders may al&s;o be di&s;appointed in their wi&s;hes and ex|pectations; but this is not an object of public atten|tion.</P>
<P>If my ideas are ju&s;t on this point, an increa&s;e of merchants and traders in a nation beyond what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to tran&s;act its mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s and what can obtain a &s;upport by it, is on the one hand of no benefit to the nation, as the &s;tock of national wealth receives no augmentation therefrom; and on the other is e&s;&s;entially prejudicial to the commercial intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Regularity and a good degree of permanency in the mode of bu&s;ine&s;s and the prices of merchandize, together with honorable dealing and punctuality, are e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of the intere&s;t of commerce, to a national reputation and general confidence, and on the whole to the pro&s;perity and advancement of the commerce of a nation; and I know of nothing which tends to de&s;troy &s;uch a proper order of things in trade and to introduce confu&s;ion, perplexity and embarra&s;&s;ment into the mercantile intere&s;t than &s;uper|numeraries in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for which rea&s;on I con|ceive that altho' it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the principles and &s;pirit of a free government, to lay prohibitions on per&s;ons entering into any lawful bu&s;ine&s;s for the pur|po&s;e of obtaining a livelihood; yet that the commer|cial regulations &s;hould not be &s;o calculated as to en|courage
<PB N="86" REF="021774_0085_0FB59E9099145960">more people to enter into trade than is nece&s;|&s;ary to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of merchandize to the ad|vantage of the public, and to the benefit of tho&s;e who are occupied therein.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ir, have I communicated in as brief a man|ner as I could, my ideas and &s;entiments on the agri|culture, manufactures, and commerce of the United States, as they are connected with a national revenue; together with &s;ome of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which appear to me nece&s;&s;ary to render them reciprocally beneficial to each other, and mutually &s;ub&s;ervient to the wel|fare of the nation. In all which I have no preten&s;ions to infallibility. They are the re&s;ult of my own re|flections on the &s;ubject, and I give them as a contri|bution to the general &s;tock of &s;peculation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> which the &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commerce, at fir&s;t adopted and put in operation by the national legi&s;lature, may make on the minds of the people, will be attended with important con|&s;equences. If it be &s;uch as will commend it&s;elf to the good &s;en&s;e and judgment of the people, &s;uch as &s;hall appear to be &s;ounded in rea&s;on and good policy, it will be approved and &s;upported by them, notwith|&s;tanding it may be particularly more unfavourable to the intere&s;t of &s;ome individuals than others. It will &s;top the mouths of gain&s;ayers to the con&s;titution, and contribute mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially to the peaceable and firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of the national government. But if it &s;hould be with rea&s;on objectionable, either in its principles, or effects, it may create a general un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and give the opponents a great opportunity to di&s;turb the public peace, by exciting jealou&s;ies, and in&s;tigating popular clamour. And as the &s;ub|ject is capable of being exhibited in various points of view; as various conclu&s;ions may be drawn; and various mea&s;ures propo&s;ed; &s;o I conceive &s;ome ad|vantages in framing the mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem, may be derived from every repre&s;entation, and every propo|&s;ition
<PB N="87" REF="021774_0086_0FB59E9201410798">which can be made. Some new light may be thrown on the &s;ubject thereby; &s;ome new hint &s;ug|ge&s;ted, which may &s;erve as a clue, to the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t inve&s;tigation, and lead to the mo&s;t judicious conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>With the&s;e views, and to this end, I have prevail|ed on my&s;elf to communicate my &s;entiments and ob|&s;ervations; and, if they &s;hould be found worthy of notice&mdash;if any thing capable of improvement, my mo&s;t flattering hopes will be fully an&s;wered. If not, I &s;hall always enjoy the con&s;olation of reflecting, that the United States do not want my warme&s;t wi&s;hes, for their happine&s;s and welfare.</P>
<P>I have already intruded too far on your patience; but I would neverthele&s;s, beg leave to add a few tran&s;ient and unconnected ob&s;ervations further, re|lative to the POLICY of the United States.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXCISE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE before ob&s;erved, that to lay a heavy tax on real property, and to make it the prin|cipal re&s;ource of government, ought, if, po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided. Many, I am &s;en&s;ible, are of opini|on, that an impo&s;t will be inadequate to the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of government; yet, I mu&s;t think, that mo&s;t of the money which could be drawn from the people with convenience, might be drawn in this way; but at the &s;ame time, as one general princi|ple which I have all along aimed at &s;upporting, would not have its weight and full effect without an exci&s;e, I apprehend it ought to be included in the &s;y&s;tem of revenue. The principle I allude to is, that the luxuries, &s;uperfluities, &amp;c. made u&s;e of by the people, &s;hould be con&s;idered and taxed as a pro|per medium of revenue.</P>
<P>It is an opinion which I have long entertained, that there are vices, follies, extravagancies and vanity

And as many of the &s;uperfluities, &amp;c. made u&s;e of by the people, are of the manufacture of the United States, and many other proper objects of taxation, not with|in the limits of an impo&s;t, a &s;y&s;tem of revenue would be imperfect were the&s;e not to be taxed by way of exci&s;e, or be charged with a tax of &s;ome denomina|tion.</P>
<P>And I am of opinion al&s;o, that an exci&s;e &s;hould not be laid on any imported article; becau&s;e, all the tax which ought to be laid on the&s;e, might as well be collected at their entry, as to be at further expences in collecting an additional duty.</P>
<P>I would therefore, &s;ugge&s;t the following particu|lars, as proper objects of taxation by way of exci&s;e.

<HEAD>THE NAVIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE importance of navigation to a nation, is too great to e&s;cape general notice; and as there is no nation which has the re&s;ources and natural advan|tages to &s;upport an exten&s;ive navigation, and at la&s;t, to obtain the empire of the &s;ea, that the United States have, I conceive, a foundation ought to be laid as early as po&s;&s;ible for the &s;upport and increa&s;e of their navigation.</P>
<P>The re&s;ources of the States, and the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of their citizens are known by mo&s;t of the maritime powers of Europe. They know the States can build, equip and navigate, and con&s;equently can freight cheaper than any nation in Europe. And they are &s;en&s;ible, that by an encouragement of the navigation of the States, a foundation would be laid for &s;uch a maritime force, as to endanger their Ame|rican dominions. It is, I conceive, for the&s;e rea&s;ons among others, that Great Britain in particular, is taking the mo&s;t decided mea&s;ures in its power, to &s;uppre&s;s the navigation of the States. And it is for this rea&s;on al&s;o, that the States, ought to exert them|&s;elves, and take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures in their power, for the &s;upport of their navigation, and of their right with other nations to the occupancy of the &s;eas.</P>
<P>No ve&s;&s;el therefore, &s;hould be imployed in the na|vigation of the United States, but tho&s;e which are built in them; and navigated by the ma&s;ter and greater part of the crew who are citizens, or Ameri|can &s;ubjects. And for the prevention of fraud, and uncertainties, with re&s;pect to the build, owners and crew; the regi&s;ter &s;hould particularly &s;tate and &s;et forth the place where, the time when, and carpen|ter by whom the ve&s;&s;el was built. Her rig, general form and model. Her length from her &s;tem to her
<PB N="90" REF="021774_0089_0FB59E9F0E6EDAD0">tran&s;om, on the main deck. Her extreme width, and her depth at the forepart of her hatchway; al&s;o her true tonage, according to carpenters mea&s;urement. The owner, or owners, if more than one the part each may own, and their re&s;pective places of re&s;idence; &s;hould likewi&s;e be &s;tated and &s;et forth in the regi&s;ter. Certificates al&s;o, I conceive, &s;hould accompany every clearance, de&s;criptive of the ma&s;ter and crew, the place of their nativity and their pre&s;ent allegiance.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of any alteration in the rig, form and mo|del of the ve&s;&s;el, or in the owners, the regi&s;ter &s;hould be returned and canceled, and a new one taken out.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, I conceive, are nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;up|port of the navigation of the United States, and the increa&s;e of their &s;eamen.</P>

<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition of the people of the United States, is now pacific. They think of nothing at pre&s;ent but cultivating the arts of peace, and apprehend no danger of inva&s;ion; neither do their views extend to the enlargement of territory. But this will, probably, not always be the ca&s;e. The ambition of the people of this country, like that of all other nations, will be excited by, and increa&s;e with their increa&s;ing power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t objects of their ambition lie open be|fore them, are now obvious to every attentive ob|&s;erver. The natural boundaries of the United States, are the river St. Lawrence on the north, and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi on the &s;outh, to which, one day or another the dominion of the States will probably be extend|ed; and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, are the natural ap|pendages of this continent. Beyond the&s;e, I think the United States can never have a ju&s;tifiable ob|ject of ambition,</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="021774_0090_0FB59EA04AB662C8">
The increa&s;e of the power of the States will, I am of opinion, be more rapid than the people in general are aware of, and of con&s;equence, bring the&s;e things into contemplation &s;ooner, than may be generally imagined. By the great migrations into this coun|try, in con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a good and &s;afe government, together with its natural po|pulation, the number of inhabitants will, I am per|&s;uaded, in fifty years, amount to about twenty millions. Such an increa&s;e of the power of the States, together with their natural re&s;ources, will excite the jealou&s;y, and arou&s;e the fears of tho&s;e na|tions who have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on this &s;ide the Atlantic. Some of whom may &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of the States, others may not, particularly Great Britain, who &s;o long as &s;he retains her pre&s;ent ideas of omni|potency, will never &s;olicit the friend&s;hip of the Uni|ted States; but in&s;tead thereof, will make u&s;e of every method to &s;uppre&s;s their ri&s;ing power, and when that is found impracticable, will attempt to form a confederacy again&s;t them. This, although it be a matter of conjecture, is, I think, founded on &s;uch circum&s;tances, as to render it warrantable, and notwith&s;tanding events of this nature are re&s;erv|ed for a future period of time, yet I conceive, they are objects which always ought to be kept in view, and provided for as &s;oon, and as fa&s;t as it may be in the power of the States &s;o to do. And to this end,</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be taken to in|crea&s;e the wealth of the nation, and to keep the militia in a &s;tate of good military order and di&s;cipline, a naval force, I conceive, &s;hould be collected, and in|crea&s;ed as fa&s;t as it can conveniently be done.</P>
<P>Many I know, are of opinion, that a naval force will never be requi&s;ite; but I mu&s;t differ from &s;uch in opinion; con&s;idering tho&s;e circum&s;tances which I have now taken notice of; con&s;idering that the navigation and commerce of the United States, will
<PB N="92" REF="021774_0091_0FB59EA1E8210688">more and more tend to the rivalry of the commerce of &s;everal of the maritime powers of Europe, and in con&s;equence thereof, the policy of tho&s;e nations will be oppo&s;ed to the policy of the United States, and con&s;idering al&s;o, that the only &s;ure dependence the States can have in any event, will be on their own &s;trength and re&s;ources, I cannot but think, they will have a great and nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion for a naval force. If &s;o, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a navy &s;hould be begun as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for it will require a length of time to render it formidable.</P>
<P>A naval force mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be but &s;mall at the fir&s;t, but however &s;mall it may be, it would an&s;wer &s;everal good and nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es. As 1&s;t. It would be a means of preventing a &s;muggling bu&s;ine&s;s on the coa&s;t, which is very practicable to be done, by &s;ure-concerted mea&s;ures. 2d. It wouldbe a means of preventing acts of piracy, which have frequently been committed on the coa&s;t, and even in our har|bours. And 3d. That which I e&s;teem a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence is, the teaching the order and di&s;cipline of a navy. Such a &s;chool is wanted, for tho&s;e young men, who might be di&s;po&s;ed to im|prove them&s;elves in naval and nautical knowledge; for which rea&s;on, if a naval force &s;hould be collected, let it be ever &s;o &s;mall, a &s;trict di&s;cipline &s;hould al|ways be maintained, and con&s;idered a principal ob|ject&mdash;Should a naval armament at any future time, be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the nation, or other national purpo&s;es, it would lay the States under great di&s;advantages, had they no citizens capable of com|manding.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia has become a con&s;iderable maritime power, yet &s;he has introduced Engli&s;hmen into her navy as officers; and that to &s;uch a degree, that were they to quit her &s;ervice, her navy would be prejudiced, if not ruined&mdash;And &s;hould a rupture happen between Ru&s;&s;ia and Great-Britain, which is by no means im|po&s;&s;ible, what dependence would Ru&s;&s;ia make on her navy, commanded by Engli&s;hmen.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> SECURITY <HI>and</HI> COLLECTION <HI>of the</HI> IMPOST.</HEAD>
<P>A JUST and punctual payment of the impo&s;t, is not only of importance to the revenue, but to the intere&s;t of the fair trader; for which rea&s;on, it be|comes the intere&s;t and duty of the public and of indi|viduals, particularly the merchants, to make u&s;e of the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures in their power, for the &s;ecurity and collection of the duties which may be impo&s;ed on articles of importation.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of the United States is &s;o exten&s;ive, with &s;o many harbours, inlets, &amp;c. that a &s;muggling bu&s;i|ne&s;s might ea&s;ily be carried on, and that withoutmuch fear of detection. And even in the ports &s;muggling might ea&s;ily and &s;afely be done, unle&s;s a great num|ber of officers &s;hould be added to the cu&s;tom hou&s;es.</P>
<P>As the States have patterned after the Briti&s;h na|tion in many things, &s;o, among others, they have adopted the Briti&s;h methods of &s;ecuring the impo&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts in oaths and a multiplicity of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers. But I conceive, a much better mode could be devi&s;ed; for a multiplicity of officers is but a burden on the revenue, and &s;o far as my ob|&s;ervation extends, I cannot but think a national re|venue is in general, more defrauded by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, than by &s;mugglers.</P>
<P>The United States would undoubtedly prefer the mo&s;t eligible and effectual, and at the &s;ame time, the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome methods of &s;ecuring and col|lecting the revenue. And among a variety of me|thods that might he propo&s;ed, I would take the liberty to propo&s;e one, which, con&s;idering every circum&s;tance, appears to me, the mo&s;t eligible. I will not pretend to &s;ay it is, in fact, worthy of ap|probation; but it may neverthele&s;s, be a means of producing &s;omething better.</P>
<P>The mode I would propo&s;e is this To appoint a collector general, who will keep his office at the
<PB N="94" REF="021774_0093_0FB59EAD0D91FFC0">&s;eat of government. Appoint a collector in each port, where a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e may be nece&s;&s;ary; and weighers, guagers and mea&s;urers in the ports, where a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed, in number, according to the bu&s;ine&s;s to be performed in the re&s;pective ports; the &s;ame al&s;o, in &s;uch out ports as ve&s;&s;els may belong to, and di&s;charge at. The&s;e, I conceive, are all the officers nece&s;&s;ary to be appointed.</P>
<P>The duty of the weighers, &amp;c. to a&s;certain the contents of &s;uch cargoes as require weighing, guaging and mea&s;uring, and to return certificates thereof (they being under oath, and penal obligations) to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The duty of the collectors to be, be&s;ides what is u&s;ual and common to the office, the making of weekly, or monthly returns, in the ori|ginal papers of the entry of each ve&s;&s;el, to the Col|lector General's office. The duty of the Collector General to re-enter in his books every ve&s;&s;el and cargo originally entered in the re&s;pective ports, and and to keep a regular account with each cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. Be&s;ides, it will probably be found nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;t this office with certain powers, and to require certain duties of it, which circum&s;tances may &s;ugge&s;t and particularize.</P>
<P>Some material advantages, I apprehend, would be derived from &s;uch an in&s;titution and arrangement, and render it preferable to the common and u&s;ual methods made u&s;e of in Great Britain, and in this country. It would render the office, duty and bur|den of &s;earchers, tide-waters, &amp;c. unnece&s;&s;ary: It would give the revenue every &s;ecurity again&s;t the mal-practices of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, which is in|tended to be provided again&s;t, by a plurality of offi|cers in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;es of Great Britain; and, what I conceive would be a matter of weighty con|&s;ideration, is, that government could at all times re|ceive official information of the &s;tate of the revenue, without delay, trouble or expence.</P>

<P>On the ma&s;ter's giving in his manife&s;t, and before permi&s;&s;ion be granted for the di&s;charge of the ve&s;&s;el, he &s;hall execute a bond, with one &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, in a penal &s;um &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; the condition of which to be, that he, the ma&s;ter, hath made a full and ju&s;t report of his cargo; that he hath not landed out of his ve&s;&s;el, or &s;uffered to be landed, or put, or &s;uffered to be put on board of any ve&s;&s;el or boat, for the purpo&s;e of being landed in any part of the United States, any part of his cargo, at any time &s;ince his departure from his port of clearance, until that time, with intent to defraud the revenue, And this bond
<PB N="96" REF="021774_0095_0FB59EB0319D2818">to remain in force for the term of five years. If no information is made within that time, accompanied with &s;ub&s;tantial proof of a fal&s;e entry, &amp;c. the bond then to become void. But, if within that time it &s;hall appear, by &s;ufficient te&s;timony, that any part was &s;muggled, the penalty to be forfeited, and the bond pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>By the requi&s;ition of &s;uch a bond, to remain in force for &s;o great a length of time, it appears to me, the duties would be more effectually &s;ecured, than by any other method; for, I think, no ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el would dare to run the ri&s;que of a &s;hort entry, when &s;o much time was re&s;erved for detection; and no man would be willing to join in &s;uch a bond, until he was &s;ure of being &s;afe. The propriety of the mea&s;ure I will &s;ubmit, but I am humbly of opininion, that without &s;ome methods of this nature, the duties in the United States will never be fully &s;ecured, being &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced as they are.</P>
<P>I am aware of &s;ome inconveniencies which may a|ri&s;e from this mode, but I know of none wholly un|exceptionable. It may be objectionable on account of its litigiou&s;ne&s;s. This would ari&s;e principally from the various rates of duties impo&s;ed on a great variety of particular articles; but no method occurs to me in which this inconvenience could be fully remedied, unle&s;s the idea of encouraging and &s;upporting the ma|nufacturing intere&s;t of the &s;tates &s;hould be given up, wich I pre&s;ume will not be the ca&s;e. However, I conceive that the forms of entry may be &s;o &s;implified and methodized, as to remedy mo&s;t of the inconveni|ences which may ari&s;e from this cau&s;e. It may be found exceptionable on another account. Ve&s;&s;els be|longing to, and di&s;charging at an out port, would lay the ma&s;ter and his &s;ecurities under the nece&s;&s;ity of making two journies to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, before the duties could be &s;ettled. This is an inconvenience for which I know of no remedy, for I conceive no delay
<PB N="97" REF="021774_0096_0FB59EB850C6DC60">&s;hould be made in the &s;ettlement of the duties. Forty-eight hours after the contents of the cargo is a&s;cer|tained, is time &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, if at an out port; and twenty-four hours, if at the port where a cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed. To delay the &s;ettlement of the duties until it may be convenient for the ma&s;ter to at|tend at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, or, until he &s;hould have oc|ca&s;ion to clear his ve&s;&s;el out, in order to &s;ave the trou|ble of an extra journey, would be &s;o out of rule, and &s;o dangerous to the revenue, that &s;uch an indulgence could not with any propriety be granted. Another objection may be made. It frequently happens, that ve&s;&s;els belonging to one port of the States, having car|goes on board con&s;igned to the ma&s;ter or &s;upercargo, enter in other ports of the States, out of which car|goes on extra commi&s;&s;ion could not, without incon|venience, be given as an inducement to a merchant to become a &s;ecurity in the requi&s;ite bonds. In order therefore to remedy this, and to accommodate the intere&s;t of the merchants of the United States, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the ma&s;ters executing the bonds, might be declared by law to be &s;ufficient to bind the owner, or owners, let them re&s;ide in whatever part of the States they may. This is one rea&s;on among others, why, I conceive, that regi&s;ters &s;hould be particular and explicit in the &s;tatement of the owners of ve&s;&s;els. On the whole therefore, I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on why the impo&s;t may not be &s;ecured and collected, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, and with as few inconveni|ences, in &s;ome methods of the nature here &s;ugge&s;ted, as in any which can be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>To what I have here ob&s;erved, I would beg leave to add a few remarks relative to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have had frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving the conduct of revenue officers in a variety of &s;ituations and circum&s;tances, and the proceedings of maritime courts in ca&s;es of &s;eizure for a breach of the laws of trade; and I have remarked a number of abu&s;es to
<PB N="98" REF="021774_0097_0FB59EBB861E3920">the revenue and many hard&s;hips and grievances &s;uf|fered by people who have unfortunately fell into the hands of the officers of the cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t or all nations, a pro&s;ecution in the ca&s;e of a breach of the laws of trade is confined to the officers of the cu&s;toms, by which means they have it in their power to defraud the revenue for the &s;ake of a bribe; in a manner &s;afe to them&s;elves as well as the per&s;on indulged. In&s;tances of this nature are frequent in many ports. To prevent &s;uch practices I conceive a liberal reward &s;hould be propo&s;ed to an informer and pro&s;ecutor, and that any per&s;on whatever be authori|&s;ed to pro&s;ecute on giving &s;ufficient bonds as well as a cu&s;tom hou&s;e officer; be&s;ides, a cu&s;tom hou&s;e officer &s;hould be &s;ubjected to heavy penalties and high for|feitures in ca&s;es of mal-practice. On the other hand, a per&s;on who maliciou&s;ly or wantonly informs again&s;t or pro&s;ecutes any per&s;on for a breach of the laws of trade, &s;hould be liable to a &s;evere puni&s;hment be&s;ides making good all damages. An informer ought not to be given up except in this ca&s;e, neither &s;hould he be admitted as an evidence.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of &s;eizure I have ob&s;erved under the Bri|ti&s;h government very unfair and ungenerous methods made u&s;e of in the preparatory examinations. Tho&s;e people who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be knowing to the fact are &s;eparately examined and cro&s;s examined, accom|panied often with threats or promi&s;es, until &s;omething is in this manner drawn out &s;ufficient to &s;erve the end in view; and without admitting the per&s;on or per&s;ons concerned to be pre&s;ent. By this means many in|nocent people have &s;uffered extremely.</P>
<P>No examinations of this nature I conceive ought to be admitted but in the pre&s;ence of the parties con|cerned.</P>
<P>I have known an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tomary compli|ment to the judge of a court of admiralty in all ca&s;es of condemnation. This is &s;o barefaced a piece of bri|bery,
<PB N="99" REF="021774_0098_0FB59EBCC654D598">that no government would avow and &s;upport it: But in &s;ea&s;ons of popular zeal, as was lately the ca&s;e among the Engli&s;h, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the naviga|tion of the United States, it may be winked at. Such abu&s;es however of the judicial powers, &s;hould un|doubtedly be guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>I have known al&s;o, ruin and di&s;tre&s;s brought on per|&s;ons by a rigorous execution of the laws, who have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to a pro&s;ecution, ignorantly or in|advertently. As the intention and de&s;ign con&s;titutes the criminality of actions, &s;o the laws in all ca&s;es ought to di&s;criminate between intentional and wilful offenders, and tho&s;e who have been guilty of a breach of law, ignorantly and unde&s;ignedly. The courts of admiralty therefore, I conceive, &s;hould be inve&s;ted with a di&s;eretionary power to mitigate penalties and forfeitures, in &s;uch ca&s;es wherein there may be &s;ufficient rea&s;on to determine they were incurred through ignorance or inadvertence. There are, I apprehend, but few ca&s;es brought into any court in which it cannot be determined how &s;ar a delinquent was intentionally criminal.</P>

<P>MANY of the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages of this country are copied from the practices of Great-Britain; &s;ome of which are &s;uitable and proper, and &s;ome are not; among which, the u&s;age of conferring the title of <HI>Excellency</HI> on the governors of the &s;tates, was con|tinued &s;ince the revolution, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e that the governors of provinces under the Briti&s;h government had &s;uch a title conferred on them. The propriety or impropriety of this u&s;age depends on the original intention of it, applying it to pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="021774_0099_0FB59AF9035495B8">
The title of Excellency is conferred by the Briti&s;h government, (where it originated) on per&s;ons of di&s;|tingui&s;hed rank; yet, they are always con&s;idered as inferior. It is given to per&s;ons at the head of de|partments, but at the &s;ame time, &s;uch as are con&s;i|dered &s;ubordinate to the &s;upreme executive authority of the nation. To render the application of the title proper therefore, and con&s;i&s;tent with the original idea on which it was founded, it ought not to have been conferred on the fir&s;t and highe&s;t executive au|thority of the States, before their late union; becau&s;e the office and rank was &s;upreme and un&s;ubordinate. But as the &s;tates have united in a general government, and by that have rendered the government of the &s;tates in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ubordinate to the national go|vernment, the title of Excellency becomes again pro|per for the governors of the re&s;pective &s;tates; at the &s;ame time however, it renders it improper for the Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>If titles mean and intend any thing, it is undoubt|edly to di&s;tingui&s;h per&s;ons in the various ranks they hold, either in the civil, military, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical departments. To apply a title therefore, founded on the idea of inferiority to the fir&s;t offices of the nation, and highe&s;t ranks in life, or to confer a title indi&s;cri|minately on &s;upreme, and &s;ubordinate ranks, appears to me to be the confounding of ideas, and making u&s;e of titles without meaning.</P>
<P>The pre&s;idency of the United States is as high an office, and of as much dignity and importance as can be con&s;tituted and e&s;tabli&s;hed by any nation on earth; and although I &s;hould object in my own mind to the Pre&s;ident's being ornamented with unmeaning and o&s;tentatious titles; yet, &s;uch a title, in my humble opinion, ought to be conferred, as would in a rational and decent manner, di&s;tingui&s;h the rank, and be ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the re&s;pect due from the people to that per|&s;on, who, by their own &s;uffrages, they advance to a &s;tation of the highe&s;t national dignity and honor.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="021774_0100_0FB59AFA8200A648">
In primitive times, when titles were made u&s;e of for no other purpo&s;es but that of di&s;tingui&s;hing per|&s;ons in the various ranks and offices which they filled, the &s;imple title of king was given to the head of the nation, which was &s;ufficient; for to that could be affixed every idea of di&s;tinction, honor and re&s;pect, that ought to be connected therewith, as well as by adding a multiplicity of di&s;tingui&s;hing appellations. But &s;ince then, as people have refined and improved in the arts of pride and vanity, and as the kings of the earth have, at times, maintained an ab&s;olute do|minion over the minds and per&s;ons of their &s;ubjects, they have a&s;&s;umed titles which are repugnant to rea|&s;on, religion and propriety. In fact, many of them approach nigh on the borders of idolatry. They are not properly titles, but attributive appellations, at|tributing certain qualifications and properties, &s;up|po&s;ed, or admitted to be inherent in kings; the evident de&s;ign and rea&s;on of which is to gratify a &s;pirit of pride and vanity, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t predominating quality of a royal mind; to excite a &s;pirit of &s;ervility and awe in the minds of the people, and to era&s;e out of the mind the mortifying idea of humanity.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h nation, as enlightened as it is, has gone as far into this &s;pirit of pride and o&s;tentation, and &s;pecies of idolatry, as any nation in Europe, which is called in Great-Britain, the dignity of government. But I cannot but hope and expect the United States will never con&s;ider the dignity of their government to con&s;i&s;t in titles, or in an awful di&s;tance placed be|tween the officers of &s;tate, and the people at large; but in &s;omething more e&s;&s;ential to real national dig|nity and honor.</P>
<P>The citizens of the United States, in all their pub|lic proceedings, have exhibited an unprecedented ex|ample, of a people &s;pread over an exten&s;ive territory, remote from one another; who&s;e intere&s;ts, cu&s;toms and manners are different, yet, uniting in national
<PB N="102" REF="021774_0101_0FB59B0276A7A360">mea&s;ures, and without a dictator, or any coercive power, governing them&s;elves by rea&s;on and principle; and the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e which on all occa&s;ions has dictated the mo&s;t proper mea&s;ures, will, I doubt not, &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome proper titles for the Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident; &s;uch as will be free from European arro|gance and impiety, and con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e, republican principles, and the genius of the people; &s;uch as will di&s;tingui&s;h ranks and offices of the fir&s;t na|tional dignity and importance, and be expre&s;&s;ive of that degree of honor and re&s;pect which is rea&s;onably and preceptively enjoined on the people.</P>
<P>I will take the liberty to mention what has &s;truck my mind on this &s;ubject, but as it is a late and tran|&s;ient thought, I do it with diffidence.</P>
<P>That which has appeared to me as proper and con|&s;i&s;tent with my own ideas, is this: For the Pre&s;ident, <HI>The High and Mo&s;t Honorable,</HI> the Pre&s;ident, &amp;c. And for the Vice-Pre&s;ident, <HI>The High and Honorable,</HI> the Vice-Pre&s;ident, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The only objection which at pre&s;ent occurs to me, that could be made to &s;uch titles, by the mo&s;t rigid commonwealths-men, would be with re&s;pect to their per&s;onal application. <HI>Your Highne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>His Highne&s;s</HI> might in &s;ome ears &s;ound unplea&s;ant, and too much like royalty. But I apprehend it would be found on examination, to contain nothing but what is quite pro|per and rea&s;onable, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution, and the &s;pirit and principles of a free government. I &s;ugge&s;t it however as a matter of &s;pe|culation.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be, With great e&s;teem and re&s;pect, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient and Very humble Servant,
