<HEAD>PREFACE TO THIS EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE gracious hand of Divine Providence in the pre&s;ervation of the <HI>New-England</HI> Colonies in their infant &s;tate, gloriou&s;ly appears, from the facts, briefly, but faithfully tran&s;mitted down to us, by one of our venerable forefathers in the following NARRATIVE of the Troubles with the Indians in <HI>New-England,</HI> a very numerous and barbarous people, di&s;per&s;ed through the wilderne&s;s in every part of the land.</P>
<P>THESE Savages began a War with the fir&s;t Engli&s;h Adventurers, while they were few in number, yea very few, and &s;trangers in the land. This rendered their deliverance an event truly great and memorable.</P>
<P>THEY were &s;aved indeed, as by fire: Their lo&s;s of men and &s;ub&s;tance, compared with their numbers and ability, was very great, and long &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>HEAVY as the public expences were to &s;upport the War, the&s;e were but a very incon&s;iderable part of the burdens and charges to which particular towns, fami|lies and individuals were nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjected, in guards, garri&s;ons, and watchings in their own defence.</P>
<P>THE whole Country was the &s;eat of War, and every man procured his bread in jeopardy of his life.</P>
<P>LIKE Nehemiah's builders, each one toiled with his weapon of war in one hand, and his in&s;trument of labor
<PB N="vi" REF="014120_0004_0F92FEF23AF454B8">in the other; expo&s;ed every moment to death, from a watchful un&s;een foe.</P>
<P>IN the frequent alarms which &s;pread from town to town, &s;ome e&s;caping from danger, ran into greater; others met their own fate in their attempts to relieve their neighbours in the &s;ame, or different &s;cattered &s;et|tlements.</P>
<P>THIS was the deplorable &s;tate of the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies, a very few towns excepted; a di&s;tre&s;s, more ea&s;ily conceived than expre&s;&s;ed, and indeed &s;carcely conceivable by the greater part of the pre&s;ent genera|tion, &s;ince the then hideous wilderne&s;s is become a fruit|ful field, and well &s;ettled towns over&s;pread the land.</P>
<P>THE reader unacquainted with this country in its un|cultivated &s;tate, may here inquire, Why the fir&s;t &s;ettlers thus expo&s;ed them&s;elves, by making disjoined and very di&s;tant &s;ettlements? Nece&s;&s;ity led to this: The lands near the &s;ea-coa&s;ts were generally le&s;s fertile, and found hard to &s;ubdue; therefore, for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in their feeble condition, they were obliged to &s;eek the borders of rivers and &s;treams, for the &s;ake of intervals and meadows, both on account of their fertility, and of their being open and prepared for immediate improve|ment.</P>
<P>THEY were al&s;o encouraged in making the&s;e &s;catter|ed &s;ettlements by the general friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the Natives, who freely &s;old their lands, for which a valua|ble con&s;ideration was paid, without exception, where a claim was made.</P>
<P>THE Indians perceived their intere&s;t in admitting their Engli&s;h neighbours, as they furni&s;hed them with means of much ea&s;ier &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the utmo&s;t care was taken by the &s;everal governments of the united co|o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, to prevent every occa&s;ion of di&s;tru&s;t,</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="014120_0005_0F92FEF2C2E72230">
THE <HI>Pequod</HI> War was confined to the we&s;terly parts of <HI>Connecticut.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Not far from <HI>New-London.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>PHILLIP'S War, as it is called, began in <HI>Plymouth Colony,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Head-Quarters were at <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> now <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></NOTE> but &s;pread through the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and province of <HI>Main,</HI> in extent above 300 miles. And within the compa&s;s of one year, the nu|merous tribes of Savages within the limits of <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> were drawn into this war again&s;t us, a very few excepted.</P>
<P>SURELY we may &s;ay, had not the Lord been on our &s;ide, when men thus ro&s;e up again&s;t us, they had quick|ly &s;wallowed us up.</P>
<P>OUR Fathers, indeed, had come out of great tribula|tion, into this wilderne&s;s, which, under Providence was a means of improving them in faith, fortitude and pa|tience, to endure hard&s;hips beyond a parallel, 'till they obtained deliverance: And &s;ome of the fir&s;t adventur|ers lived to &s;ee the wilderne&s;s become a fruitful field.</P>
<P>BUT this was not their intended re&s;t: They had &s;ublimer views: They looked for another and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter country, that is an heavenly. And however they may have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, by ignorant or ill-de&s;igning per&s;ons, they were men of whom the world was not worthy.</P>
<P>THE cruel charges of peculiar bigotry, and a per&s;e|cuting &s;pirit, wantonly alledged again&s;t them, are found|ed on facts not truly &s;tated.</P>

ACCORDING to the natural cour&s;e of things in this depraved and mutable &s;tate, their de&s;cendants at this day, as might be expected, have in a mea&s;ure, departed from that &s;implicity of manners, by which their renown|ed ance&s;tors were ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed: But notwith&s;tand|ing, it may with truth be a&s;&s;erted, that no in&s;tance can be produced, in the pre&s;ent or any pa&s;t age, among like numbers, where good order has &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed, as in the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies, even in populous and opulent towns, e&s;pecially our CAPITAL.</P>
<P>WE of this province, with incon&s;iderable intermi&s;&s;i|ons, from that early period, at unknown expence and lo&s;s, have been called to defend our lives and properties again&s;t the incur&s;ions of more di&s;tant &s;avages. Our tru&s;t hath been in the name of the Lord, our fathers God and Deliverer; and hitherto he hath delivered us. May we never be unmindful of his &s;ignal benefits!</P>
<P>WE are now, under the &s;miles of divine Providence, encrea&s;ed to a multitude of people.</P>
<P>OUR many frontier &s;ettlements are continually expo&s;ed to &s;avage inva&s;ion: And though we tru&s;t not to our own bow; yet, as prudence directs, we are all armed and prepared for a defen&s;ive War. And yet, having the wormwood and the gall &s;till in remembrance, no peo|ple more ardently wi&s;h and pray, that Wars may forever cea&s;e, and peace on earth, and good will among men, univer&s;ally prevail.</P>

<HEAD>A NARRATIVE OF THE INDIAN WARS IN NEW-ENGLAND, FROM THE FIRST PLANTING THERE|OF IN THE YEAR MDCVII, TO THE YEAR MDCLXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>KNOWN unto God are all his works from the foundation of the world, though manife&s;t to us, only by the events of time, that fruit|ful mother of all things, which in the former age did bring forth, at lea&s;t did bring to light the knowledge of this we&s;tern world, called <HI>America,</HI> that in all foregoing times and ages, lay hid in this ob|&s;cure and remote region, covered with a veil of igno|rance, and locked up from the knowledge of all the re&s;t of the inhabitants of the earth. To whom the honor of its inve&s;tigation doth of right more properly belong, is &s;ufficiently declared by the hi&s;tory and reports of &s;uch as were eye-witne&s;&s;es thereof, and not intended to be any part of the pre&s;ent di&s;qui&s;ition. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of all the north &s;ide of <HI>America,</HI> is called <HI>New-England.</HI> In the fertility of the &s;oil, &s;alubriou&s;ne&s;s of the air, and many other commodious advantages, mo&s;t re&s;embling the country from whence it borrowed its ap|pellation. For the knowledge thereof the world is mo&s;t beholding to the di&s;coveries of the Engli&s;h, under the conduct of <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot,</HI> a famous Portugue&s;e, &s;ent out under the commi&s;&s;ion of HENRY the VIIth, about the year 1497, though &s;ince much perfected by the in|du&s;try and travels of Capt. <HI>Go&s;nold,</HI> Capt. <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> Capt. <HI>Smith,</HI> and others of the Engli&s;h nation. <HI>North-Ame|rica,</HI>

From which grand and original pa|tent, all other charters and grants of land from <HI>Pemma|quid</HI> to <HI>Delaware-Bay,</HI> along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, derive their lineage and pedigree. Thus was that va&s;t tract of land, after the year 1612, cantoned and parcelled out into many le&s;&s;er divi&s;ions and parcels, according as adven|turers pre&s;ented, which &s;aid grants being founded upon uncertain, or fal&s;e de&s;criptions, and reports of &s;ome that travelled thither, did many of them interfere one upon another, to the great di&s;turbance of the fir&s;t planters, and prejudice of the proprietors them&s;elves, as is too well known by any that have had occa&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay never &s;o little among&s;t them, many of whom are yet &s;urviving.

<P>BUT whether it were by the imprudence of the fir&s;t adventurers, or the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of the per&s;ons they &s;ent over to manage their affairs, or whether for want of faithfulne&s;s or &s;kill to manage their tru&s;t, they were by degrees in a manner quite de&s;erted almo&s;t of law and government, and left to &s;hift for them&s;elves; by which means at la&s;t they fell under the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Colony,</HI> not by u&s;urpation, as is by great mi&s;|take &s;ugge&s;ted to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> but by nece&s;&s;ity, and the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the planters them&s;elves; to accept of whom, tho&s;e of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Colony</HI> were the more ea&s;ily induced; in that they apprehended the bounds of their own patent, by a favorable interpretation of the words de&s;cribing the northern line (three miles beyond the mo&s;t northerly branch of <HI>Merimack</HI>-river) do reach &s;omewhat beyond <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> the mo&s;t northerly place of all <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the fir&s;t beginning of things in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> at which time they were not unlike the times of old, when the people of <HI>Judah</HI> ware &s;aid to be without a teaching prie&s;t, and without law; and no wonder things were no more &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on</P>

<P>THE north and &s;outh border of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> being thus planted, the middle part was the more ea&s;y to be filled up, which was thus brought about.

Yea, &s;uch was the confluence of people making over into tho&s;e parts, that in the year 1637, a fourth colony began to be planted, bearing the name of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> from the fir&s;t town erected therein, &s;eated near the midway betwixt <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river and that of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The &s;ea coa&s;t from the pitch of <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> to the mouth of <HI>Connecticut</HI> river, inhabited by &s;everal nations of Indians, <HI>Wampa|noogs</HI> (the fir&s;t authors of the pre&s;ent rebellion) <HI>Narrha|gan&s;ets, Pequods, Mohegins,</HI> as the more inland part of the country by the <HI>Nipnets</HI> (a general name for all in|land Indians betwixt the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> river.)

ON the 26th of the &s;aid <HI>July,</HI> the two Indians which were with <HI>John Oldham,</HI> and one other Indian, came from <HI>Canonicus</HI> (the chief <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI>) with a letter from Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> to &s;ignify what had befallen <HI>John Oldham,</HI> and how grievou&s;ly they were of|fended: and that <HI>Miantonimo</HI> (the &s;econd <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI>) was gone with 17 canoes and 200 men to take revenge. But upon examination of the other Indian, who was brought pri&s;oner to them, they found that all the <HI>Sachems</HI> of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> except <HI>Ca|nonicus</HI> and <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> were contrivers of <HI>John Old|ham</HI>'s death, and the occa&s;ion was becau&s;e he went to make peace, and trade with the <HI>Pequods</HI> la&s;t year: The pri&s;oner &s;aid al&s;o that <HI>Oldham</HI>'s two Indians were ac|quainted with it; but becau&s;e they were &s;ent as me&s;&s;en|gers from <HI>Canonicus,</HI> they would not impri&s;on them: But the Governor wrote back to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> to let the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> know, they expected they &s;hould &s;end home <HI>John Oldham</HI>'s two boys, and take revenge upon the I&s;landers, and withal gave Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> caution to look to him&s;elf, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion to make war with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> (for <HI>Block-I&s;land</HI> was under them) and the next day he wrote to <HI>Canonicus,</HI> by one of tho&s;e Indians, that he had &s;u&s;picion of him that was &s;ent, and yet he had &s;ent him back, becau&s;e he was a me&s;&s;enger: but did expect, if he &s;hould &s;end for the &s;aid two Indians, he &s;hould &s;end them to him.</P>
<P>FOUR days after <HI>John Oldham</HI>'s two boys were &s;ent home by one of <HI>Miantonimo</HI>'s men, with a letter from Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> that <HI>Miantonimo</HI> had cau&s;ed the <HI>Sachem</HI> of <HI>Niantick</HI> to &s;end to <HI>Block-I&s;land</HI> for them, and that he had near 100 fathom of peag, and much other goods of <HI>Oldham</HI>'s which &s;hould be re&s;erved for them.

Sometimes they came with their canoes into the river in view of the &s;oldiers within the fort, and when they apprehended them&s;elves out of reach of their guns, they would imitate the dying groans and invoca|tions of the poor captive Engli&s;h, which the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers were forced with &s;ilent patience to bear, not be|ing then in a capacity to requite their in&s;olent bla&s;phe|mies.

<P>THE colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> determined to &s;end an hundred and &s;ixty, of whom an hundred and twenty were ordered under the conduct of Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> of <HI>Watertown,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Tra&s;k</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stoughton</HI> of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> being to command in chief; with whom was &s;ent that holy man of God, Mr. <HI>John Wil&s;on,</HI> (pa&s;tor of the church of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) the chariots and hor&s;emen of our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by who&s;e faith and prayer, as &s;ometimes was &s;aid of <HI>Luther</HI> (in reference to <HI>Germany</HI>) the country was pre&s;erved, &s;o as it was confidently believed that no enemy &s;hould break in upon a place whil&s;t he &s;urvived, which as &s;ome have ob&s;erved accordingly came to pa&s;s.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<PB N="31" REF="014120_0029_0F92FF09F084D278">le&s;s; and marching on five miles further, we made another alta, where they told us we had near a dozen miles to <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous</HI> his fort, as we gathered by their relation: Being very weary in travelling with our arms, ammunition and provi&s;ion; we were con&s;trained to alter our re&s;olution, and re&s;olve to attempt that fort, the which they had formerly de&s;cribed to be three or four miles nearer; and al&s;o one of Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI>'s men failing put it out of doubt. But who&s;oever &s;aith that Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> had any falling out about that or any thing el&s;e, doth &s;peak untruth; for we both re&s;olved to <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous</HI> his fort, as we con|cluded in our con&s;ultation at <HI>Narrhagan&s;et;</HI> and &s;o continued our re&s;olution 'till we received the former rea&s;ons as grounds &s;ufficient to per&s;wade us to the contrary, and to pro&s;ecute that which was mo&s;t like|ly to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THEY drew a plot of the &s;ituation of the <HI>Pequods</HI> and de&s;cribed <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous</HI> his fort to be the neare&s;t, which was the chief cau&s;e we determined to a&s;&s;ault that fir&s;t, and had no rea&s;on leading till our la&s;t alta, where, upon the rea&s;ons formerly mentioned, we changed our re&s;olution: This greatly plea&s;ed the Indians that were with us, as it was what they much de&s;ired; for it was dreadful to them to hear the name of <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous.</HI></P>
<P>FROM thence we marched two or three miles where we kept our rendezvous, &s;uppo&s;ing we had been within one mile of the fort: An Indian &s;ent to di&s;cover beforehand, brought us news that they were &s;ecure, having been fi&s;hing with many canoes at &s;ea, and divers of them walking here and there.</P>
<P>ABOUT two hours before day we marched toward the fort, being weary and much &s;pent; many of us having &s;lept nothing at all.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="014120_0030_0F92FF0AA7EC65E0">us, after a tedious march of three or four miles: About break of day we came fair in view of the fort, &s;tanding on the top of an hill not &s;teep; the Indians all falling back, were &s;uddenly vani&s;hed out of &s;ight, &s;o we made an alta, and &s;ent back for our guide, who had promi&s;ed to go with us to the fort, but his heart we &s;aw much failed him; we a&s;ked him what they intended who promi&s;ed to wing us, and to &s;urround the fort; he told us they were much afraid; but he, &s;eeing our re&s;olution, went to them and prevailed with divers of them to come up to us; we told them their be&s;t cour&s;e would be to flank the fort on both &s;ides, and having no time longer to confer, we proceeded: Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> to the we&s;tern entrance with one di|vi&s;ion, my&s;elf with the other to the ea&s;tern as &s;ilent as po&s;&s;ibly we could; &s;o it plea&s;ed God we came up within two rod of the Pali&s;ado, before we were di&s;|covered; at which time a dog began to bark, and an Indian cried out; but not being my&s;elf rightly in|formed by the Indian guide, of the right entrance, though there was a little po&s;tern door, the which I had thought to have attempted to break down with my foot; but the Lord directed me otherwi&s;e for the bet|ter; for I then feared we could not there enter with our arms, which proved true.

<P>BEING very hot and dry we could very hardly procure any water, we continued there one hour not knowing what cour&s;e to take or which way to go, our Pinnaces not being come in, neither did we know how far, or which way to go to them, our in|terpreter, being an Indian, we could hardly come to &s;peak with him: When we did, he knew nothing of what his countrymen intended, who were all hur|ried and di&s;tracted with a few hurt men, but chiefly as I conceive with fear of the enemy.</P>

<P>THE re&s;t of the enemy being fir&s;t fired out of their &s;trong hold, were taken and de&s;troyed, a great number of them being &s;eized in the places where they intend|ed to have hid them&s;elves, the re&s;t fled out of their own country over <HI>Connecticut</HI> river, up toward the Dutch plantation.

<P>THE re&s;t of the <HI>Pequods</HI> from whom <HI>Sa&s;&s;acous</HI> had made an e&s;cape, &s;hifted every one for him&s;elf, leaving but three or four behind them (when a party of our &s;oldiers according to the direction of him that was &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t as a &s;py came upon the place) who would not or could not tell them whither their company were fled; but our &s;oldiers ranging up and down as providence guided them, at the la&s;t, <HI>July</HI> 13, 1637, they lighted upon a great number of them, they pur&s;ued them to a &s;mall Indian town &s;eated by the &s;ide of an hideous &s;wamp (near the place where <HI>Fairfield</HI> or <HI>Stratford</HI> now &s;tand) into which they all &s;lipt, as well <HI>Pequods</HI> as natives of the place, before our men could make any &s;hot upon them, having placed a centinel to give warning. Mr. <HI>Ludlow</HI> and Capt. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> with half a &s;core of their men happened to di&s;cover this crew. Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> and Capt. <HI>Tra&s;k</HI> with about an hundred of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> forces came in upon them pre&s;ently after the alarm was given; &s;uch commanders as fir&s;t happened to be there gave &s;pecial or|ders that the &s;wamp &s;hould be &s;urrounded (being about a mile in compa&s;s) but Lieut. <HI>Davenport</HI> belonging to Capt. <HI>Tra&s;k</HI>'s company, not hearing the word of command, with a dozen more of his company, in an over eager pur&s;uit of the enemy, ru&s;hed immediately into the &s;wamp, where they were very rudely entertained by tho&s;e evening wolves that newly kennelled therein; for Lieut. <HI>Davenport</HI> was &s;orely wounded in the body, <HI>John Wedgwood</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> in the belly, and was laid hold on by &s;ome of the Indians; <HI>Thomas Sherman</HI> of &s;aid <HI>Ip&s;|wich</HI> in the neck; &s;ome of their neighbours that ven|tured in with them were in danger of the enemy's arrows that flew very thick about them, others were in as much hazard of being &s;wallowed by the miry boggs of the

<P>BUT the Indians of the place, who had for company &s;ake run with their gue&s;ts the <HI>Pequods</HI> into the &s;wamp, did not love their friend&s;hip &s;o well as to be killed with them al&s;o for company &s;ake, wherefore they began to bethink them&s;elves that they had done no wrong to the Engli&s;h, and de&s;ired a parly, which was granted, and they pre&s;ently under&s;tood one another by the means of <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> an exact interpreter then at hand. Upon which the Sachem of the place with &s;everal others and their wives and children, that liked better to live quietly in their wigwams than to be buried in the &s;wamp, came forth and had their lives granted them: After &s;ome time of further parly with the&s;e, the inter|preter was &s;ent in to offer the like terms to the re&s;t, but they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;pirit of &s;tupidity and &s;ullenne&s;s that they re&s;olved rather to &s;ell their lives for what they could get there; and to that end began to let fly their arrows thick again&s;t him as intending to make his blood &s;ome part of the price of their own; but thro' the goodne&s;s of God toward him, his life was not to be &s;old on that account, he being pre&s;ently fetched off.</P>
<P>BY this time night drawing on, our commanders perceiving on which &s;ide of the &s;wamp the enemies were lodged, gave orders to cut through the &s;wamp with their &s;words, that they might the better hem them round in one corner, which was pre&s;ently done, and &s;o they were begirt in all night, the Engli&s;h in the circumference plying them with &s;hot all the time, by which means many of them were killed and buried in the mire, as they found the next day.

<PB N="39" REF="014120_0037_0F92FF11A1833D28">it, the enemy was kept in all the night; but a little before day-break (by rea&s;on of the fogg that u&s;eth to ari&s;e about that time, ob&s;erved to be the darke&s;t time of the night) twenty or thirty of the lu&s;tie&s;t of the enemy broke through the be&s;iegers, and e&s;caped away into the woods, &s;ome by violence and &s;ome by &s;tealth dropping away, &s;ome of whom notwith&s;tanding were killed in the pur&s;uit; the re&s;t were le&s;t to the mercy of the con|querors, of which many were killed in the &s;wamp like &s;ullen dogs, that would rather in their &s;elf-willedne&s;s and madne&s;s &s;it &s;till to be &s;hot through or cut in pieces, than receive their lives for a&s;king at the hand of tho&s;e into who&s;e power they were now fallen. Some that are yet living and worthy of credit do affirm, that in the morning entering into the &s;wamp, they &s;aw &s;everal heaps of them &s;itting clo&s;e together, upon whom they di&s;charged their pieces laden with ten or twelve pi&s;tol bullets at a time, putting the muzzels of their pieces un|der the boughs within a few yards of them; &s;o as be|&s;ides tho&s;e that were found dead (near twenty it was judged) many more were killed and &s;unk into the mire and never were minded more by friend or foe: Of tho&s;e who were not &s;o de&s;perate or &s;ullen to &s;ell their lives for nothing, but yielded in time, the male children were &s;ent to the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> of the females &s;ome were di&s;|tributed to the Engli&s;h towns, &s;ome were di&s;po&s;ed of among the other Indians, to whom they were deadly enemies as well as to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS overthrow given to the <HI>Pequods</HI> &s;truck &s;uch a terror into all the Indians in tho&s;e parts (&s;ome of whom had been ill-affected to the Engli&s;h before) that they &s;ought our friend&s;hip, and rendered them&s;elves to be un|der our protection, which they then obtained, and have never &s;ince forfeited it any of them till this late rebellion of <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;ubject of the following di&s;cour&s;e. A|mong&s;t the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners &s;pecial notice was taken of the wife of a noted Indian called <HI>Mononotto,</HI> who with her children &s;ubmitted her&s;elf, or by the chance of the war fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h: it was known to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> her mediation that two Engli&s;h maids (that were taken

<P>AFTER this &s;laughter at the &s;wamp, the <HI>Pequods</HI> be|ing upon every turn expo&s;ed to the revenge of the <HI>Mohegins</HI> on one &s;ide, and the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> on the other, cho&s;e ra|ther to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Seven hundred of them were thought to be de&s;troyed.</NOTE> by whom they were put, &s;ome under the <HI>Mohegins</HI> and &s;ome under the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> which at la&s;t proved the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent quarrel as is conceived, through the ambi|tion of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> as will be hereafter related.</P>
<P>ON the 12th of <HI>July,</HI> 1637, one <HI>Aganemo,</HI> a Sachem of the <HI>Niantick</HI> Indians (who were a branch of the <HI>Nar|hagan&s;ets)</HI> came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with &s;eventeen of his own men; he made divers propo&s;itions to the Engli&s;h, which they took into con&s;ideration, and promi&s;ed to give him an an&s;wer the next day: But finding that he had re&s;cued divers of the <HI>Pequods,</HI> &s;ubmitting to him &s;ince the la&s;t defeat, they fir&s;t demanded the delivery of them, which he &s;ticking at, they refu&s;ed further confer|ence with him: But the next morning he came and of|fered what they de&s;ired. So the Governor referred him to the Captains at the <HI>Pequod</HI> country, and writ in|&s;tructions to them how to deal with him. So receiving his ten fathom of wampam, they friendly di&s;mi&s;s'd him.</P>
<P>IN <HI>July</HI> 1638, <HI>Uncas</HI> the Sachem of the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> having entertained &s;ome of the <HI>Pequods,</HI> came to the

<P>THIS was the i&s;&s;ue of the <HI>Pequod</HI> war, which in the day of it here in <HI>New-England</HI> was as formidable to the country in general as the pre&s;ent war with <HI>Philip;</HI> the experience of which, becau&s;e it may admini&s;ter much matter of comfort and encouragement to the &s;urviving generation, as well as of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to Al|mighty God, from all tho&s;e who have thus long quietly enjoyed the benefit and reaped the frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their labor and courage who engaged therein, the more pains hath been taken to &s;earch out the broken pieces of that &s;tory and thus put them together, before the memory thereof was buried in the ruins of time, and pa&s;t the recove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and knowledge of the pre&s;ent age.</P>

They carried it &s;ubtilly and underhand for &s;ome years, and were pre|tending quarrels with the &s;aid <HI>Uncas,</HI> again&s;t whom they always had an inveterate malice, ever &s;ince the agree|ment made about di&s;tributing the <HI>Pequods,</HI> after the war with them was ended; expecting in all probability that all &s;hould have been left to their &s;ole arbitriment. The <HI>Mohegins</HI> on the other &s;ide, though not &s;o numerous, yet a more warlike people and more politic, always made their recour&s;e to the Engli&s;h, complaining of the in&s;o|lencies of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> contrary to their league, &s;o as they would hardly be kept from making open war again&s;t them, when they &s;aw all other attempts to kill and de&s;troy <HI>Uncas</HI> the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Sachem, by treachery, poi&s;on, and &s;orcery, prove ineffectual. In&s;omuch that at la&s;t the malice of <HI>Miantonimo</HI> and his <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> grew to that height, that they began to plot again&s;t the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, for defending of <HI>Uncas.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> were animated by the haughty &s;pirit and a&s;piring mind of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> the heir appa|rent of all the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> people, after the decea&s;e of the old Sachem, <HI>Canonicus,</HI> who was his uncle. This <HI>Miantonimo</HI> was a very goodly per&s;onage, of tall &s;tature, &s;ubtil and cunning in his contrivements, as well as haughty in his de&s;igns. It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that in the year 1642, he had contrived to draw all the In|dians throughout the country into a general con&s;piracy again&s;t the Engli&s;h: For, the fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> 1642, letters came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> from the Court at <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="014120_0041_0F92FF145F590640">from two of the Magi&s;trates there, that the Indians had con&s;pired to cut off the Engli&s;h all over the country: Mr. <HI>Ludlow</HI> certified &s;o much from the place where he lived near the Dutch. The time appointed to be for the a&s;&s;ault, was &s;aid to be after harve&s;t, the manner to be by &s;everal companies entering into the chief men's hou&s;es, by way of trade, and then to kill them in their hou&s;es, and &s;eize their arms, and others &s;hould be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hand to pro&s;ecute the ma&s;&s;acre: This was al&s;o confirm|ed by three Indians that were &s;aid to reveal it in the &s;ame manner, and at the &s;ame time, to Mr. <HI>Ludlow;</HI> and to the Governor of <HI>New-Haven.</HI> It was added al&s;o that another Indian &s;hould di&s;cover the &s;ame plot to Mr. <HI>Haines</HI> of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> by &s;ome &s;pecial circum&s;tances, viz. that being much hurt by a cart (which u&s;ually there are drawn with oxen) he &s;hould &s;end for Mr. <HI>Haines</HI> and tell him, that Engli&s;hman's God was angry with him, and &s;ent Engli&s;hman's cow (meaning the oxen in the cart, or wayne) to kill him, becau&s;e he had concealed a plot again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and &s;o told him all as the other Indians had done.</P>
<P>UPON this, their advice from <HI>Connecticut</HI> was, that we &s;hould begin with them, and enter upon a war pre|&s;ently, and that if the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> would &s;end 120 men to <HI>Saybrook,</HI> at the river's mouth, they would meet them with a proportionable number. This was a very probable &s;tory, and very likely it was, that the Indians had been di&s;cour&s;ing of &s;ome &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s among them|&s;elves. But the General Court of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> when called together, did not think tho&s;e informations to be a &s;ufficient ground whereon to begin a war. Al|though the Governor and Magi&s;trates as many as could convene together before the Court, ordered that all the Indians within their juri&s;diction &s;hould be di&s;armed, which they willingly yielded unto: And upon all the enquiries and examinations which were made by the Court when a&s;&s;embled together, they could not find any &s;uch violent pre&s;umption of a con&s;piracy, as to be the ground of a war. Be&s;ides, it was con&s;idered, that the reports of all Indians were found by experience to be
<PB N="44" REF="014120_0042_0F92FF154C0D7300">very uncertain, e&s;pecially when it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they are or may be rai&s;ed and carried by &s;uch as are at variance one with another; who may be very like to accu&s;e one another to ingratiate them&s;elves with the Engli&s;h. <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> Sachem of <HI>Narrhagan&s;et,</HI> was &s;ent unto, and by his readine&s;s to appear, &s;atisfied the Engli&s;h that he was innocent as to any pre&s;ent con&s;pi|racy; though his quarrel with the <HI>Mohegins</HI> (who bor|dered upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> colony) might very probably, as was judged, render him the &s;ubject of &s;uch a report, or an occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>THE &s;aid <HI>Miantonimo</HI> when he came before the Court peremptorily demanded that his accu&s;ers might be bro'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before him face to face, and if they could not prove it, then to be made to &s;uffer, what him&s;elf if he had been found guilty had de&s;erved, i. e. death, his rea&s;ons for which were very plau&s;ible. He urged very much the pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a law again&s;t his accu&s;ers; alledging, that if the Engli&s;h did not believe it, why did they di&s;arm the Indians round about: And if they did believe it, equity required, that they who accu&s;ed him &s;hould be puni&s;hed according to the offence charged upon him&s;elf. He offered al&s;o to make it good again&s;t <HI>Uncas,</HI> Sachem of the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> that the report was rai&s;ed either by him, or &s;ome of his people. The Engli&s;h an&s;wered, that divers Indians had robbed &s;ome of the Engli&s;h men's hou&s;es, which might be a &s;ufficient ground to di&s;arm; and with that he was &s;omething &s;atisfied. The <HI>Connecticut</HI> men were hardly prevailed with to for|bear the war again&s;t them, but at la&s;t they were overcome with the allegations of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> to lay it a&s;ide.</P>
<P>MIANTONIMO when he was at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> was very de|liberate in his an&s;wers, &s;hewing a good under&s;tanding in the principles of ju&s;tice and equity, as well as a &s;eeming ingenuity withal: But though his words were &s;moother than oil, yet, as many conceived, in his heart were drawn &s;words. It was ob&s;erved al&s;o, that he would never &s;peak but when &s;ome of his Coun&s;ellors were pre|&s;ent, that they might, as he &s;aid, bear witne&s;s of all his &s;peeches at their return home.</P>

THEY &s;pent two days in the treaty, wherein at la&s;t he gave them &s;atisfaction in all things, though he held off long about the <HI>Nianticks,</HI> of whom he &s;aid they were as his own fle&s;h, engaging on their behalf, that if they &s;hould do any wrong, &s;o as neither he nor they could &s;atisfy without blood, then he would leave them to the mercy of the Engli&s;h. At his departure he gave his hand to the Governor, telling him, that was for the Magi&s;trates that were ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>WHILE he was at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> one of his own followers had been a principal evidence again&s;t him; he how|ever promi&s;ed to deliver him to the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Sachem who&s;e &s;ubject he was; notwith&s;tanding which promi&s;e, going homeward he cut off his head to prevent his tell|ing more tales.

<P>IN the years 1645 and 1646, they grew &s;o in&s;olent, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the united colonies were com|pelled to rai&s;e forces to go again&s;t them, but when they preceived that the Engli&s;h were in good earne&s;t, they began to be afraid, and &s;ued for peace, and &s;ubmitted
<PB N="46" REF="014120_0044_0F92FF16EB8DF6A0">to pay tribute to &s;atisfy for the charge of preparation for the war, but were always very backward to make pay|ment until the Engli&s;h were forced to demand it by new forces, &s;o that it appeared they were unwillingly willing to hold any friendly corre&s;pondence with the Engli&s;h, yet dur&s;t they never make any open attempt upon them, un|til the pre&s;ent rebellion, wherein they had no &s;mall hand, is too, too evident, notwith&s;tanding all their pretences to the contrary, as will appear in the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THUS it is apparent upon what terms the Engli&s;h &s;tood with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> ever &s;ince the cutting off <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> their chief Sachem's head by <HI>Uncas,</HI> it being done with the advice and coun&s;el of the Engli&s;h, <HI>Anno</HI> 1643. As for the re&s;t of the Indians, ever &s;ince the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Pequods</HI> in the year 1637, until the year 1675, there was always in appearance amity and good corre&s;pondence on all &s;ides, &s;carce an Engli&s;h|man was ever known to be a&s;&s;aulted or hurt by any of them, until after the year 1671, when the &s;on of one <HI>Matoonas,</HI> who as was &s;uppo&s;ed, being vexed in his mind that the de&s;ign again&s;t the Engli&s;h, intended to begin 1671, did not take place, out of meer malice and &s;pite again&s;t them, &s;lew an Engli&s;hman traveiling along the road, the &s;aid <HI>Matoonas</HI> being a <HI>Nipnet</HI> Indian, which <HI>Nipnets</HI> were under the command of the Sachem of <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> the author of all the pre&s;ent mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>UPON a due enquiry into all preceeding tran&s;actions between the Indians and the Engli&s;h, from their fir&s;t &s;ettling in the&s;e coa&s;ts, there will appear no ground of quarrel that any of them had again&s;t the Engli&s;h, nor any provocation upon one account or another; for when <HI>Pli|mouth</HI> colony was fir&s;t planted, within three months af|ter their fir&s;t landing, <HI>March</HI> 16, 1620, <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> the chief Sachem of all that &s;ide of the country, repaired to the Engli&s;h at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and entered into a &s;olemn league upon &s;undry articles, (printed in <HI>New-England</HI>'s Memorial, 1669) which are as follows, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="47" REF="014120_0045_0F92FF19EEB5C380">
1. THAT neither he nor any of his &s;hould injure or do hurt to any of their people.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he &s;hould &s;end the offender that they might puni&s;h him.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT if any thing were taken away from any of theirs, he &s;hould cau&s;e it to be re&s;tored; and they &s;hould do the like to his.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT if any did unju&s;tly war again&s;t him, they &s;hould aid him, and if any did war again&s;t them, he &s;hould aid them.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT he &s;hould &s;end to his neighbour confede|rates, to certify them of this, that they might not wrong them, but might likewi&s;e be compri&s;ed in the&s;e conditi|ons of peace.</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT when his men came to them upon any occa&s;ion, they &s;hould leave their arms <HI>(which were then bows and arrows)</HI> behind them.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT &s;o doing, their &s;overeign Lord King JAMES would e&s;teem him as their friend and ally.</P>
<P>THIS league the &s;ame Sachem, <HI>September</HI> 25, 1630, a little before his death, coming with his elde&s;t &s;on, af|terward called <HI>Alexander,</HI> did renew with the Engli&s;h at the Court of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> for him&s;elf and his &s;on, and their heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: And after that he came to Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>'s, who lived not far from <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> bringing his two &s;ons, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> with him, de&s;iring there might be love and amity after his death, between his &s;ons and them, as there had been betwixt him&s;elf and them in former times: Yet it is very remarkable, that this <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Woo&s;amequen</HI> (how much &s;oever he affected the Engli&s;h, yet) was never in the lea&s;t degree well affected to the religion of the Engli&s;h, but would in his la&s;t treaty with his neighbours at <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> when they were with him about purcha&s;ing &s;ome land at <HI>Swanzey,</HI> have had them engaged never to at|tempt to draw away any of his people from their old

The like may be ob|&s;erved concerning the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> who were always more civil and courteous to the Engli&s;h than any of the other Indians, tho' never as yet received the lea&s;t tincture of chri&s;tian religion, but have in a manner run the &s;ame fate with their neighbours of <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> there being very few of them now le&s;t &s;tanding. Nor is it unworthy the relation, what a per&s;on of quality among&s;t us hath of late affirmed, viz. One much conver&s;ant with the Indians about <HI>Merimack</HI> river, being <HI>Anno</HI> 1660, invit|ed by &s;ome Sagamores or Sachems to a great dance, (which &s;olemnities are the times they make u&s;e of to tell their &s;tories, and convey the knowledge of &s;ome pa&s;t and mo&s;t memorable things to po&s;terity) <HI>Pa&s;&s;aconaway,</HI> the great Sachem of that part of the country, intending at that time to make his la&s;t and farewell &s;peech to his children and people, that were then all gathered toge|ther, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them in this manner:</P>

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age was thought &s;it to be in&s;erted here, it having &s;o near an agreement with the former, intima|ting &s;ome &s;ecret awe of God upon the hearts of &s;ome of the principal among&s;t them, that they dur&s;t not hurt the Engli&s;h, although they bare no good affection to their religion, wherein they &s;eem not a little to imitate <HI>Ba|laam,</HI> who whatever he uttered, when he was under the awful power of divine illumination, yet when left to him&s;elf, was as bad an enemy to the I&s;rael of God as ever before.

<P>AFTER the death of this <HI>Woo&s;amequen,</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> his elde&s;t &s;on &s;ucceeded him about 20 years &s;ince, <HI>Alex|ander</HI> by name, who notwith&s;tanding the league he had entered into with the Engli&s;h, together with his father, in the year 1639, had neither affection to the Engli&s;h|men's per&s;ons, nor yet to their religion, but had been plotting with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> to ri&s;e again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h; of which the Governor and Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> be|ing informed, they pre&s;ently &s;ent for him, to bring him to the Court; the per&s;on to whom that &s;ervice was com|mitted, was a prudent and re&s;olute gentleman, the pre|&s;ent Governor of the &s;aid colony, who was neither a|fraid of danger, nor yet willing to delay in a matter of that moment, he forthwith taking eight or ten &s;tout men with him well armed, intended to have gone to the &s;aid <HI>Alexander</HI>'s dwelling, di&s;tant at lea&s;t forty miles from the Governor's hou&s;e&punc; but by a good providence, he found him whom he went to &s;eek at an hunting-hou&s;e, within

<P>I THINK I can clearly &s;ay, that before the&s;e pre|&s;ent troubles broke out, the Engli&s;h did not po&s;&s;e&s;s one foot of land in this colony, but what was fairly obtained by hone&s;t purcha&s;e of the Indian proprietors: Nay, becau&s;e &s;ome of our people are of a covetous di&s;po&s;ition, and the Indians are in their &s;traits ea&s;ily prevailed with to part with their lands, we fir&s;t made a law, that none &s;hould purcha&s;e or receive of gift, any land of the Indians without the knowledge and allowance of our Court, and penalty of a fine, five pounds per acre, for all that &s;hould be &s;o bought or obtained. And le&s;t yet they &s;hould be &s;treightned,
<PB N="55" REF="014120_0053_0F979A28F32C3C28">we ordered that <HI>Mount-Hope, Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> and &s;everal other necks of the be&s;t land in the colony, becau&s;e mu&s;t &s;uitable and convenient for them, &s;hould never be bought out of their hands, or el&s;e they would have &s;old them long &s;ince.

<P>YET did this treacherous and perfidious caitiff &s;till harbour the &s;ame or more mi&s;chievous thoughts again&s;t the Engli&s;h than ever before, and hath been &s;ince that time plotting with all the Indians round about, to make a general in&s;urrection again&s;t the Engli&s;h in all the co|lonies; which, as &s;ome pri&s;oners lately brought in have confe&s;&s;ed, &s;hould have been put in execution at once, by all the Indians ri&s;ing as one man, again&s;t all tho&s;e plan|tations of Engli&s;h, which were next to them. The <HI>Nar|rhagan&s;ets</HI> having promi&s;ed, as was confe&s;&s;ed, to ri&s;e with four thou&s;and fighting men in the &s;pring of this pre&s;ent year, 1676. But by the occa&s;ion hereafter to be mentioned about <HI>Sau&s;aman, Philip</HI> was nece&s;&s;itated for the &s;afety of his own life to begin his rebellion the year before, when the de&s;ign was not &s;ully ripe. Yet &s;ome are ready to think, that if his own life had not now been in
<PB N="56" REF="014120_0054_0F979A29B249D720">jeopardy by the guilt of the murder of the afore&s;aid <HI>Sau&s;aman,</HI> his heart might have failed him, when it &s;hould have come to be put in execution, as it did be|fore in the year 1671, which made one of his Captains, of far better courage and re&s;olution than him&s;elf, when he &s;aw his cowardly temper and di&s;po&s;ition, fling down his arms, calling him white liver'd cur, or to that pur|po&s;e, and &s;aying, that he would never own him again, or fight under him; and from that time hath turned to the Engli&s;h, and hath continued to this day a faithful and re&s;olute &s;oldier in their quarrel.</P>
<P>THAT the Indians had a con&s;piracy among&s;t them|&s;elves to ri&s;e again&s;t the Engli&s;h, is confirmed by &s;ome of the Indians about <HI>Hadley,</HI> although the plot was not come to maturity when <HI>Philip</HI> began, the &s;pecial providence of God therein over-ruling the contrivers: For when the beginning of the troubles fir&s;t was report|ed from <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> many of the Indians were in a kind of a maze, not knowing well what to do, &s;ometimes ready to &s;tand for the Engli&s;h, as formerly they had been wont to do; &s;ometimes inclining to &s;trike in with <HI>Philip</HI> (which at the la&s;t they generally did) which if it had been fore&s;een, much of that mi&s;chief might have been prevented that fell out in &s;everal places, more by perfi|dious and treacherous dealing than any other ways; the Engli&s;h never imagining that after &s;o many obliging kindne&s;&s;es received from them by the Indians, be&s;ides their many engagements and prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, as formerly, they would have been &s;o ungrateful, perfi|diou&s;ly fal&s;e and cruel, as they have &s;ince proved.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of <HI>Philip</HI>'s &s;o &s;udden taking up arms the la&s;t year was this&mdash;There was one <HI>John Sau&s;aman</HI> a very cunning and plau&s;ible Indian well &s;killed in the Engli&s;h language, and bred up in a profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion, employed as a &s;chool-ma&s;ter at <HI>Na|tick,</HI> the Indian town, who upon &s;ome mi&s;demeanor fled from his place to <HI>Philip,</HI> by whom he was entertained in the room and office of a Secretary, and his chief Coun&s;ellor, whom he tru&s;ted with all his affairs and &s;e|cret
<PB N="57" REF="014120_0055_0F979A2A72AAB400">coun&s;els: But afterwards, whether upon the &s;ting of his own con&s;cience, or by the frequent &s;ollicitations of Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> that had known him from a child, and in|&s;tructed him in the principles of our religion, who was often laying before him the heinous fin of his apo&s;tacy, and returning back to his old vomit, he was at la&s;t pre|vailed with to for&s;ake <HI>Philip,</HI> and returned back to the chri&s;tian Indians at <HI>Natick,</HI> where he was baptized, ma|nife&s;ting public repentance for all his former offences, and made a &s;erious profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion: and did apply him&s;elf to preach to the Indians, wherein he was better gifted than any other of the Indian nati|on; &s;o as he was ob&s;erved to conform more to the Engli&s;h manners than any other Indian: yet having occa&s;ion to go up with &s;ome others of his countrymen to <HI>Nama&s;ket;</HI> (now <HI>Middleborough</HI>) whether for the ad|vantage of fi&s;hing, or &s;ome &s;uch occa&s;ion, it matters not; being there not far from <HI>Philip</HI>'s country, he had occa|&s;ion to be much in the company of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Indians, and of <HI>Philip</HI> him&s;elf; by which means he di&s;cerned by &s;e|veral circum&s;tances, that the Indians were plotting anew again&s;t us; the which out of faithfulne&s;s to the Engli&s;h, the &s;aid <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI> informed the Governor of, adding al&s;o, that if it were known that he revealed it, he knew they would pre&s;ently kill him. There appearing &s;o many concurrent te&s;timonies from others, making it the more probable, that there was a certain truth in the in|formation, &s;ome enquiry was made into the bu&s;ine&s;s, by examining <HI>Philip</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;everal of his Indians, who although they would own nothing, yet could not free them&s;elves from ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion. <HI>Philip</HI> therefore &s;oon after contrived the &s;aid <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI>'s death, which was &s;trangely di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding it was &s;o cun|ningly effected, for they that murdered him met him up|on the ice on a great pond, and pre&s;ently after they had knocked him down, put him under the ice, yet leaving his gun and hat upon the ice, that it might be thought he &s;ell in accidentally through the ice and was drowned: but being mi&s;&s;ed by his friends, who finding his hat and gun, they were thereby led to the place, where his body was found under the ice. When they
<PB N="58" REF="014120_0056_0F979A2C1241BC90">took him up to bury him, &s;ome of his friends, particu|larly one <HI>David,</HI> ob&s;erved &s;ome brui&s;es about his head, which made them &s;u&s;pect he was fir&s;t knocked down, before he was put into the water, however, they buried him near about the place where he was found, with|out making any further enquiry at pre&s;ent: neverthele&s;s <HI>David</HI> his friend, reported the&s;e things to &s;ome Engli&s;h at <HI>Taunton</HI> (a town not far from <HI>Nama&s;ket</HI>) which occa|&s;ioned the Governor to enquire further into the bu&s;ine&s;s, wi&s;ely con&s;idering, that as <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI> had told him, if it were known that he had revealed any of their plots, they would murder him for his pains: wherefore, by &s;pecial warrant the body of <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI> being digged again out of his grave, it was very apparent that he had been kill|ed and not drowned. And by a &s;trange providence, an Indian was found, that by accident &s;tanding un&s;een up|on a hill, had &s;een them murdering the &s;aid <HI>Sau&s;aman,</HI> but dur&s;t never reveal it for fear of lo&s;ing his own life likewi&s;e, until he was called to the Court at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> or before the Governor, where he plainly confe&s;&s;ed what he had &s;een. The murderers being apprehended, were convicted by his undeniable te&s;timony, and other re|markable circum&s;tances, and &s;o were all put to death, being three in number; the la&s;t of them confe&s;&s;ed im|mediately before his death, that his father (one of the Coun&s;ellors and &s;pecial friends of <HI>Philip</HI>) was one of the two that murdered <HI>Sau&s;aman,</HI> him&s;elf only looking on. This was done at <HI>Plimouth</HI> Court, hold in <HI>June,</HI> 1675, in&s;omuch that <HI>Philip</HI> apprehending the danger his own head was in next, never u&s;ed any further means to clear him&s;elf from what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plotting again&s;t the Engli&s;h, nor yet about <HI>Sau&s;aman</HI>'s death; but by keeping his men continually about him in arms, and gathering what &s;trangers he could to join with him, marching up and down con&s;tantly in arms, both all the while the Court &s;at, as well as afterwards. The Engli&s;h of <HI>Plimouth</HI> hearing of all this, yet took no further notice, than only to order a military watch in all the adjacent towns, hoping that <HI>Philip,</HI> finding him&s;elf not likely to be ar|raigned by order of the &s;aid Court, the pre&s;ent cloud
<PB N="59" REF="014120_0057_0F979A2CB38FBCD0">might blow over, as &s;ome others of like nature had done before; but in conclu&s;ion, the matter proved otherwi&s;e, for <HI>Philip</HI> finding his &s;trength daily increa&s;ing by the flocking of neighbour Indians unto him, and &s;ending over their wives and children to the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> for &s;ecurity (as they u&s;e to do when they intend war with any of their enemies) they immediately began to alarm the Engli&s;h at <HI>Swanzey</HI> (the next town to <HI>Philip</HI>'s coun|try) as it were daring the Engli&s;h to begin; at la&s;t their in&s;olencies grew to &s;uch an height, that they began not only to u&s;e threatening words to the Engli&s;h, but al&s;o to kill their cattle and rifle their hou&s;es; whereat an Engli&s;hman was &s;o provoked, that he let fly a gun at an Indian, but did only wound, not kill him; whereup|on the Indians immediately began to kill all the Eng|li&s;h they could, &s;o as on the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> 1675, was the alarm of war fir&s;t &s;ounded in <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, when eight or nine of the Engli&s;h were &s;lain in and about <HI>Swanzey;</HI> they fir&s;t making a &s;hot at a company of Engli&s;h as they returned from the a&s;&s;embly where they were met in a way of humiliation on that day, whereby they killed one and wounded others, and then likewi&s;e at the &s;ame time, they &s;lew two men on the high-way, &s;ent to call a &s;urgeon; and the &s;ame day barbarou&s;ly murdered &s;ix men in and about a dwelling-hou&s;e in a|nother part of the town; all which outrages were com|mitted &s;o &s;uddenly, that the Engli&s;h had no time to make any re&s;i&s;tance: For on the 14th day of the &s;ame month, be&s;ides endeavors u&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> of <HI>Swan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Plimouth</HI> juri&s;diction, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> letter was &s;ent from the Council of <HI>Plimouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> &s;hewing their di&s;like of his practices, and ad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him to di&s;mi&s;s his &s;trange Indians, and not &s;uffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be abu&s;ed by fal&s;e reports, concerning them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intended him no hurt; but no an&s;wer could be ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, otherwi&s;e than threatning of war, which it was hoped might have been prevented, as heretofore it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en, when things &s;eemed to look with as bad a face as they then did.

The &s;ending forth of which, becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t engage|ment in any warlike preparations again&s;t the Indians, &s;hall be more particularly related.</P>
<P>ON the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> a foot company under Captain <HI>Daniel Henchman,</HI> with a troop under Captain <HI>Thomas Prentice,</HI> were &s;ent out of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> toward <HI>Mount-Hope:</HI> It being late in the afternoon before they began to march, the central eclip&s;e of the moon in <HI>Capric.</HI> hap|pened in the evening before they came up to <HI>Napon&s;et</HI> river, about twenty miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which occa&s;ioned them to make a halt, for a little repa&s;t, till the moon recovered her light again. Some melancholy fancies
<PB N="61" REF="014120_0059_0F979A2E33F43B60">would not be per&s;waded, but that the eclip&s;e falling out at that in&s;tant of time was ominous, conceiving al&s;o that in the centre of the moon they di&s;cerned an unu&s;u|al black &s;pot, not a little re&s;embling the &s;calp of an In|dian: As others not long before, imagined they &s;aw the form of an Indian bow, accounting that likewi&s;e omin|ous (although the mi&s;chief following was done by guns, and not by bows) both the one and the other, might rather have thought of what <HI>Marcus Cra&s;&s;us</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General, going forth with an army again&s;t the <HI>Parthians,</HI> once wi&s;ely replied to a private &s;oldier, that would have di&s;&s;waded him from marching that time, becau&s;e of an eclip&s;e of the moon in <HI>Capricorn, that he was more a|fraid of Sagitarius than of Capricornus,</HI> meaning the arrows of the <HI>Parthians</HI> (accounted very good archers) from whom as things then fell out, was his greate&s;t dan|ger. But after the moon had waded through the dark &s;hadow of the earth, and borrowed her light again, by the help thereof, the two companies marched on toward <HI>Woodcock</HI>'s hou&s;e, thirty miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where they arrived next morning; and there retarded their motion till the afternoon, in hope of being overtaken by a com|pany of volunteers, under the command of Captain <HI>Samuel Mo&s;ely,</HI> which accordingly came to pa&s;s, &s;o as on <HI>June</HI> 28th, they all arrived at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> where by the advice of Capt. <HI>Cudworth,</HI> the commander in chief of <HI>Plimouth</HI> forces, they were removed to the head-quarters, which for that time were appointed at Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s hou&s;e, the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Swanzy,</HI> within a quarter of a mile of the bridge, leading into <HI>Philip</HI>'s lands. They arriving there &s;ome little time before night, twelve of the troop unwilling to lo&s;e time pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge, for di&s;covery into the enemies territories, where they found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indian, firing upon them out of the bu&s;hes, killing one <HI>William Ham|mond,</HI> wounding Corporal <HI>Belcher,</HI> his hor&s;e being al&s;o &s;hot down under him; the re&s;t of the &s;aid troopers hav|ing di&s;charged upon tho&s;e Indians that run away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r their fir&s;t &s;hot, carried off their two dead and wounded companions, and &s;o retired to the main guard for that

<P>ABOUT ten o'clock the next morning, <HI>July</HI> 4th, Capt. <HI>Henchman,</HI> after a long and tedious march, came to the head-quarters, and informed that he came upon a place where the enemy had newly been that night, but were e&s;caped out of his reach: But the following night, before they were determined of any other motion, Cap|tain <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> came up from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with new orders for them to pa&s;s into <HI>Narrhagan&s;et,</HI> to treat with the Sachems there, and if it might be, to prevent their joining with <HI>Philip.</HI> Capt. <HI>Cudworth</HI> by this time was come up to the head-quarters, having left a garri&s;on of 40 men upon <HI>Mount-Hope</HI> neck. The next morning was &s;pent in con&s;ultation how to carry on the treaty; it was then re&s;olved, that they &s;hould go to make a peace with a &s;word in their hands, having no &s;mall ground of &s;u&s;picion that the &s;aid <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> might join with the enemy, wherefore they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to carry all the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> forces over into the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country, to fight them if there &s;hould be need; Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> pa&s;&s;ed over by water to attend Capt. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI>

DURING this treaty of peace with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cudworth</HI> with the forces from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> under his command, found &s;omething to do nearer home, tho' of another nature as it proved, <HI>&s;st.</HI> to make war whil&s;t the other were (as they thought) making peace: In the fir&s;t place therefore he di&s;patched Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> (joining Lieut. <HI>Church</HI> together with him in commi&s;&s;ion) with fifty in his company to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> on the &s;ame account, as the other went to <HI>Narrhagan&s;et;</HI> either to conclude a peace with them, if they would continue friends, and give ho&s;tages for the confirmation thereof, or fight them if they &s;hould declare them&s;elves enemies, and join with <HI>Philip;</HI> him&s;elf intending to draw d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn his forces to <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> to be ready for a &s;peedy march to <HI>Taunton,</HI> and &s;o down into the other &s;ale of the country, upon the news that &s;ome of the enemy were burning and &s;poiling of <HI>Middleborough</HI> and <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> two &s;mall villages ly|ing in the way betwixt <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> and <HI>Plimouth.</HI> Upon Thur&s;day <HI>July</HI> 7, Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> with Lieut. <HI>Church</HI> went into <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> to &s;eek after the enemy, or el&s;e as occa&s;ion might &s;erve, to treat with tho&s;e Indians at <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> with whom Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was very well acquainted, always holding good corre&s;pondence with them. After they had &s;pent that day and mo&s;t of the night, in traver&s;ing the &s;aid <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> neck, and watching all night in a hou&s;e which they found there, they could hear no tidings of any Indians; in&s;omuch that Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> began to be weary of his de&s;ign: Mr. <HI>Church</HI> in the mean while a&s;&s;uring him that they &s;hould find Indians before it were long: yet for greater expedition they divided their company, Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> taking down toward the &s;ea-&s;ide, where it &s;eems, after &s;ome little &s;kirmi&s;hing with them wherein one man only received a &s;mall wound, he either &s;aw or heard too many Indians for him&s;elf and his company to deal with, which made him and them betake them&s;elves to a hou&s;e near the water-&s;ide, from whence they were fetched off by a &s;loop before night to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> (for &s;o he may well be &s;tiled after this time) marched further into the neck, imagining that if there were Indians in the neck, they &s;hould find them about a pea&s;e field not far off. As &s;oon as they came near the
<PB N="69" REF="014120_0067_0F979A34F2471BE8">&s;aid field he e&s;pied two Indians among the peas, who al&s;o had at the &s;ame time e&s;pied him; and pre&s;ently mak|ing &s;ome kind of &s;hout, a great number of Indians came a|bout the field, pur&s;uing the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his men in great numbers to the &s;ea &s;ide: there being not above fifteen with <HI>Church,</HI> yet &s;even or eight &s;core of the Indians pur&s;uing after them. Now was a fit time for this young Captain and his &s;mall company to hand|&s;el their valour upon this great rout of Indians, ju&s;t ready to devour them: But victory &s;tands no more in the num|ber of &s;oldiers, than verity in the plurality of voices: And although &s;ome of the&s;e fifteen had &s;carce courage enough for them&s;elves, yet their Captain had enough for him&s;elf, and &s;ome to &s;pare for his friends, which he there had an opportunity of improving to the full. When he &s;aw the hearts of any of his followers to fail, he would bid them be of good courage and fight &s;toutly, and (po&s;|&s;ibly by &s;ome divine impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart) a&s;&s;ured them not a bullet of the enemy &s;hould hurt any one of them; which one of the company, more di&s;mayed than the re&s;t, could hardly believe, till he &s;aw the proof of it in his own per&s;on, for the Captain perceiving the man was not able to fight, made him gather rocks together for a kind of &s;helter and baricado for the re&s;t, that mu&s;t either of nece&s;&s;ity fight or fall by the enemies. It chanc|ed as this faint-hearted &s;oldier had a flat &s;tone in his arms, and was carrying it to the &s;helter that he was mak|ing upon the bank, a bullet of the enemy was thus ward|ed from his body, by which he mu&s;t el&s;e have peri&s;hed, which experience put new life into him, &s;o as he follow|ed his bu&s;ine&s;s very manfully afterward, in&s;omuch that they defended them&s;elves under a &s;mall &s;helter ha&s;tily made up, all that afternoon, not one being either &s;lain or wounded, yet it was certainly known that they killed at lea&s;t fifteen of their enemies: And at the la&s;t, when they had &s;pent all their ammunition, and made their guns un&s;erviceable by often firing, they were fetched all off by Capt. <HI>Golding</HI>'s &s;loop and carried &s;afe to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> in &s;pite of all their enemies; yea, &s;uch was the bold and un|daunted courage of this champion, Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> that, not willing to leave any token behind of their flying for want
<PB N="70" REF="014120_0068_0F979A35B243AD00">of courage, he went back in the face of his enemies to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h his hat, which he had left at a &s;pring, whither the extream heat of the weather, and his labor in fighting had cau&s;ed him to repair for the quenching of his thir&s;t an hour or two before. It &s;eems in the former part of the &s;ame day, five men coming from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> to look up their cattle upon <HI>Poca&s;&s;et-Neck,</HI> were a&s;&s;aulted by the &s;ame Indians, one of the five was Capt. <HI>Church</HI>'s &s;er|vant, who had his leg broke in the &s;kirmi&s;h, the re&s;t hardly e&s;caping with their lives: This was the fir&s;t time that ever any mi&s;chief was done by the Indians upon <HI>Poca&s;&s;et-Neck.</HI> Tho&s;e of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> were here|by alarmed to look to them&s;elves, as well as the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> or the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony.</P>
<P>THIS a&s;&s;ault rather heightned and increa&s;ed than daunted the courage of Capt. <HI>Church;</HI> for not making a cowardly flight, but a fair retreat, which providence offered him by the &s;loop afore&s;aid, after his ammunition was &s;pent, he did not &s;tay long at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> but ha&s;t|ed over to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> forces, and borrowing three files of men of Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> with his Lieutenant; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and he returned again to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> where they had another &s;kirmi&s;h with the enemy, wherein &s;ome few of them (fourteen or fifteen) were &s;lain, which &s;truck &s;uch a terror into <HI>Philip,</HI> that he betook him&s;elf to the &s;wamps about <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> where he lay hid till the return of the re&s;t of the forces from the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> like a wild boar kept at a bay by this &s;mall party till more hands came up.</P>

Having &s;pent &s;ome time in &s;earching the &s;wamp, and tired them&s;elves to no purpo&s;e (yet it was &s;aid one half hour more would have at that time utterly &s;ubdued <HI>Philip</HI> and all his power) the commander in chief, night drawing on a pace, not thinking it &s;afe to tarry longer in &s;o dangerous a place, where every one was in as much danger of his fellows as of his foes, being ready to fire upon every bu&s;h they &s;aw move &s;uppo&s;ing lndians were there, ordered a retreat to be &s;ounded, that they might have time to di&s;po&s;e of their dead and wounded men, which accordingly was attended:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h lo&s;t fifteen men in this expedition, <HI>Hutchin&s;on.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Plimouth</HI> forces who had entered in the rear, retreating in the front.

<PB N="72" REF="014120_0070_0F979A37F3D5BEB0">for that end. Major <HI>Savage,</HI> Capt. <HI>Paige</HI> with Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> and their companies returned to <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> with his troop were ordered toward <HI>Mendham,</HI> where it &s;eems, about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> &s;ome Indians, wi&s;hing well to <HI>Philip</HI>'s de&s;ign, had made an a&s;&s;ault upon &s;ome of the inhabitants, as they were at their labor in the field, killing five or fix of them; as &s;oon as they had done, flying away into the woods, &s;o as they could not ea&s;ily be pur&s;ued. The inhabitants of the &s;ame village, lying in the heart of the enemy's country began to be di&s;couraged, &s;o as within a little time after they for&s;ook the place, abandoning their hou&s;es to the fury of the enemy, which by them were &s;oon after turned into a&s;hes. But to return to King <HI>Philip,</HI> who was now lodged in the great &s;wamp upon <HI>Poca&s;&s;et-Neck,</HI> of &s;even miles long: Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> and the <HI>Plimouth</HI> forces kept a diligent eye upon the enemy, but were not willing to run into the mire and dirt after them in a dark &s;wamp, being taught by late experience how dangerous it is to fight in &s;uch di&s;mal woods, when their eyes were muffled with the leaves, and their arms pin|nioned with the thick boughs of the trees, as their feet were continually &s;hackled with the roots &s;preading every way in tho&s;e boggy woods. It is ill fighting with a wild bea&s;t in his own den. They re&s;olved therefore to &s;tarve them out of the &s;wamp, where they knew full well they could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t: To that end they be|gan to build a fort, as it were to beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his e&s;cape out of the place, where they thought they had him fa&s;t enough. <HI>Philip</HI> in the mean time was not ignorant of what was doing without, and was ready therein to read his owndoom if he tarried much longer there, he knew he &s;hould fall into their hands from whom he could expect no mercy: The ca&s;e being therefore de&s;perate, he re&s;olved with an hundred or two of his be&s;t fighting men to make an e&s;cape by the water, all pa&s;&s;ages by the land being &s;ufficiently guarded by the Engli&s;h forces. The &s;wamp where they were lodg|ed being not-far from an arm of the fen, coming up to <HI>Taunton,</HI> they taking the advantage of a low tide, either waded over one night in the end of <HI>July,</HI> or el&s;e wa&s;ted
<PB N="73" REF="014120_0071_0F979A04D56347E0">them&s;elves over upon &s;mall rafts of timber very early before break of day, by which means the greate&s;t part of his company e&s;caped away into the woods, lead|ing into the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> country, altogether unknown to the Engli&s;h forces, that lay encamped on the other &s;ide of the &s;wamp. About an 100 or more of the women and children, which were like to be rather burden&s;ome than &s;erviceable, were left behind, who &s;oon after re&s;igned up them&s;elves to the mercy of the Engli&s;h. <HI>Philip</HI>'s e&s;cape thus from <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> could not long be concealed after the day appeared, there being much champaign land thro' which he was to pa&s;s, &s;o as being di&s;covered to &s;ome of <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> the inhabitants pre&s;ently followed him, toge|ther with a party of the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> that a little before came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> offering their &s;ervice again&s;t <HI>Philip,</HI> and were &s;ent up into tho&s;e parts to be ordered by Captain <HI>Henchman,</HI> but before they came to him were ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded to go along with any of the Engli&s;h that were engaged in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Philip.</HI> News al&s;o thereof was carried to Capt. <HI>Henchman,</HI> who, as &s;oon as he could get over with &s;ix files of men (rowing hard all or mo&s;t part of the day, to get to <HI>Providence</HI>) followed after the enemy. The <HI>Mohegins</HI> with the men of <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> and &s;ome of <HI>Providence</HI> came upon their rear over night, &s;lew about 30 of them, took much plunder from them, without any con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the Engli&s;h. Captain <HI>Henchman</HI> came not up to them (pur&s;uing them only by the track) till the &s;kirmi&s;h was over, and having march|ed 22 miles that day was not well able to go any fur|ther that night; on the other hand, the forces that came from <HI>Rehoboth</HI> and that belonged to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> having left their hor&s;es three miles off, could not go back to fetch them without much lo&s;s of time, and therefore looking at it altogether bootle&s;s to go after them in the morning, returned back the next day, leaving Captain <HI>Henchman</HI> with his &s;ix files, and the <HI>Mohegins</HI> to pur&s;ue the cha&s;e to <HI>Nip&s;atchet,</HI> which he did the next morning. Capt. <HI>Henchman,</HI> that he might the better engage the <HI>Mohegins</HI> to march with him 30 miles, gave them half his provi&s;ion, and was him&s;elf recruited again by the

Mr. <HI>Newman,</HI> the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> de&s;erved not a little commendation for exciting his neighbours and friends to pur&s;ue thus far after <HI>Philip,</HI> animating of them by his own example and pre&s;ence: But what the rea&s;on was why <HI>Philip</HI> was followed no further, it is better to &s;u&s;pend, than too critically to enquire. This is now the third time when a good opportunity of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the rebellion of the Indians, was put into the hands of the Engli&s;h; but time and chance happeneth to all men. &s;o that the mo&s;t likely means are often fru|&s;trated of their de&s;ired end. All human endeavors &s;hall arrive at no other &s;ucce&s;s, than the coun&s;el of God hath pre-ordained, that no fle&s;h might glory in their own wi&s;dom, but give unto God the prai&s;e of all their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and quietly bear whatever mi&s;carriages he hath ordered to befall them. It appears by the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things, that although this wound was not incurable, yet much more blood mu&s;t be taken away before it could be healed. But by this means <HI>Philip</HI> e&s;caped away to the we&s;tward, kindling the flame of war in all the we&s;|tern plantations of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony wherever he came, &s;o that by this fatal accident, the fire that was in a likely way to be extingui&s;hed, as &s;oon almo&s;t as it be|gan, did on a &s;udden break out through the whole juri&s;|diction of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> both ea&s;tward and we&s;t|ward, endangering al&s;o the neighbour colony of <HI>Connec|ticut,</HI> which hath al&s;o &s;uffered &s;omewhat by the fury of this flame, though not con&s;iderable to what the other colonies have undergone.</P>
<P>WHILE things after this manner proceeded in and about the colony of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the re&s;t of the colonies were con&s;ulting and advi&s;ing what was to be done for preventing the mi&s;chief threatened from &s;preading any further, fearing (as indeed there was too much cau&s;e) that although <HI>Philip</HI> only appeared to make the fir&s;t attempt, yet more either already were, or &s;oon might be per&s;uaded to join with him in acting this bloody tragedy.</P>

<P>THE next thing in order to be related, is the calami|ty that befel the village of <HI>Brookfield,</HI> which notwith|&s;tanding all the care that was taken, fell into the hands of the perfidious <HI>Nipnet</HI> Indians, as &s;hall here in the next place be declared; only, as we pa&s;s along, to remind the reader in a &s;ew words, what was the i&s;&s;ue of Captain <HI>Henchman</HI>'s pur&s;uit of <HI>Philip.</HI> The <HI>Plymouth</HI> forces be|ing returned home, as was &s;aid before, Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> with his &s;ix files of men, and the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians, having continued in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Philip</HI> till they had &s;pent all their provi&s;ion, and tired them&s;elves, yet never coming within &s;ight of him, the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians in their company directed them to <HI>Mendham,</HI> and then leaving them, returned al&s;o to their own country. Captain <HI>Henchman</HI> in his march toward <HI>Mendham,</HI> or at <HI>Mend|ham,</HI> met with Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> coming up to bring him provi&s;ion, and adverti&s;ing him of what &s;ucce&s;s he had met with in the pur&s;uit, they altered their cour&s;e, for Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> was &s;ent down to the Governor and Council, to know what they &s;hould do: They pre&s;ently remanded him to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> and ordered him to &s;tay there if there was need, or el&s;e to draw off, &s;urrendering the fort he had been building to <HI>Plimouth</HI> forces, which la&s;t was cho&s;en by tho&s;e of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> whereupon Capt. <HI>Hench|man</HI> returning to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was ordered to di&s;band his men.

The next day the inhabitants &s;ent to demand their guns, Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> acquainted there|with, marched to the fort and found much &s;u&s;picion a|gain&s;t eleven of them, for &s;inging and dancing, and hav|ing bullets and &s;lugs, and much powder hid in their ba&s;kets; in&s;omuch that eleven of them were &s;ent down pri&s;oners to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> upon &s;u&s;picion that they had an hand in killing the four at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and &s;hooting at the <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;hepherd: But upon tryal, the &s;aid pri|&s;oners were all of them acquitted of the fact, and were either relea&s;ed, or el&s;e were with others of that fort, &s;ent for better &s;ecurity, and for preventing future trouble in the like kind to &s;ome of the i&s;lands below <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> toward <HI>Nanto&s;ket.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT this time Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> was &s;ent with a com|pany of &s;oldiers to &s;ome Indian plantations up <HI>Merri|mack</HI> river, as high as <HI>Pennycook,</HI> but they found no In|dians there; tho&s;e that belonged to the place having withdrawn them&s;elves from their native place, that they might not meddle in the pre&s;ent quarrel, as is confident|ly believed that <HI>Woonalon&s;et</HI> the Sachem of that country had &s;o re&s;olved. That coa&s;t being clear of the enemies, Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> &s;oon after was &s;ent up with his men to the towns we&s;tward about <HI>Hadley,</HI> if it might be, to &s;ubdue the enemy, who a little before, and at that time, was doing all the mi&s;chief he could in tho&s;e we&s;tern planta|tions, both by fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>BUT to return and pur&s;ue the rebellious Indians, and keep pace with them in our hi&s;tory, though our forces as yet could never overtake them in the woods.

But by &s;pecial providence the inhabitants were all gathered to the principal hou&s;e of the village (there being &s;carce zo in the town) before the barbarous mi&s;creants came upon them, immediately &s;etting fire upon all the dwelling hou&s;es, with mo&s;t of the other buildings in the town, &s;ave that one into which the inhabitants were retired, the which they &s;everal times attempted to burn, but were almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly defeated of their purpo&s;e by the immediate hand of God.

The occa&s;ion which brought Ma|jor <HI>Willard,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Parker</HI> of <HI>Groton</HI> with forty-&s;ix more, &s;o timely to their relief was this; Major <HI>Willard</HI> in pur&s;uance of his commi&s;&s;ion from the Governor and Council, was upon Wedne&s;day <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4th, in the morn|ing, marching out after &s;ome Indians to the we&s;tward, to &s;ecure them: ju&s;t as they were &s;etting forth, &s;ome of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who had intelligence (by tho&s;e that were going to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and forced to return) what di&s;tre&s;s <HI>Brookfield</HI> was in, and knowing of Major <HI>Willard</HI>'s pur|po&s;e to go out that morning from <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> &s;ent a po&s;t to acquaint him therewith, which though it did not find him in the town, yet overtook him before he had gone above four or five miles from the place: whereupon, con|ceiving it more needful to &s;uccour <HI>Brookfield</HI> in &s;o eminent danger, than to proceed further upon his intended de&s;ign, he altered his cour&s;e and marched directly thither, being about 30 miles di&s;tant when the tidings were brought him; &s;o he arrived there that night very &s;ea&s;onably, a|bout an hour after it was dark, or el&s;e in probability they had all peri&s;hed before the relief &s;ent up from <HI>Bo&s;|ton</HI> could have reached them, which was not till three days after. The providence of God likewi&s;e in bring|ing in the &s;aid Major &s;o &s;afely, as well as &s;ea&s;onably to their relief, was very remarkable: For the Indians had &s;ubtilly contrived to cut off all relief &s;ent, before it could come at them, by laying ambu&s;hes, and placing their &s;couts at two or three miles di&s;tance round the town:
<PB N="81" REF="014120_0079_0F979A3EB4E3A858">About an hundred of them were lodged at an hou&s;e not far off in the way toward <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to cut off any &s;uccour that might come from thence: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed they were &s;o inten&s;e upon the project they were about for fir|ing the hou&s;e, concluding it would without fail take place, that either they did not mind their bu&s;ine&s;s of watching, or made &s;uch a noi&s;e for joy thereof, that they did not hear their centinels when they &s;hot off their guns, at two miles di&s;tance. It is &s;aid that another party of the In|dians let the Major and his company purpo&s;ely pa&s;s by them, without any oppo&s;ition, waiting for the blow to be given at their fir&s;t approach near the hou&s;e, purpo&s;ing then to have them&s;elves fallen upon their rear, and &s;o to have cut them all off, before the be&s;ieged under&s;tood any thing thereof. But it plea&s;ed God &s;o to order things in pro|vidence, that no notice was taken of them by the be|&s;iegers, nor were they at all di&s;cerned by them, till they had made them&s;elves known to their friends; and were admitted within the court of guard; which when the e|nemy had notice of, they poured in their &s;hot abundant|ly upon them; but they were now &s;heltered from the danger thereof; only it &s;eems their hor&s;es were expo&s;ed to their fury, as many of them were maimed and kil|led, as were mo&s;t of the cattle belonging to the inhabi|tants of the place &s;oon after.

<P>IT is here to be noted, that although that worthy pa|triot and experienced &s;oldier, Major <HI>Willard,</HI> hearing of the di&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Brookfield</HI> by &s;ome that were travelling to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> was the fir&s;t that relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed peo|ple of <HI>Quabaog</HI> or <HI>Brookfield,</HI> yet Major <HI>Pynchon</HI> of <HI>Springfield</HI> al&s;o by accident hearing of their calamity, had not only &s;ent word thereof to <HI>Hartford,</HI> (from whom he received a &s;upply of 25 or 30 &s;oldiers under Capt. <HI>Wats)</HI> but did al&s;o &s;end a band of men under Lieut. <HI>Cooper,</HI> (afterwards villainou&s;ly &s;lain by <HI>Springfield</HI> Indians) who with tho&s;e &s;ent from <HI>Hartford,</HI> and &s;ome In|dians belonging to <HI>Springfield</HI> (&s;eemingly forward to help the Engli&s;h) made up four&s;core or thereabouts: the&s;e marched down to <HI>Brookfield</HI> the &s;ame day that Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI> and Capt. <HI>Beers</HI> came up from the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> who having &s;pent &s;ome time in &s;earching the woods about <HI>Springfield,</HI> and finding none of the Indi|ans, did the next day march up to a place called <HI>Memi|nimi&s;&s;et</HI> by the Indians, where Capt. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wheeler</HI> were a&s;&s;aulted, and finding no &s;ign of any Indians among&s;t tho&s;e woods and &s;wamps, the company that came from <HI>Springfield,</HI> left the other &s;oldiers (who returned to their quarters at <HI>Brookfield)</HI> and went up them&s;elves further northward at lea&s;t 20 miles from the

<P>BY this it appears, that the Indians by this occa&s;ion were driven more we&s;tward into the woods between <HI>Hadley</HI> and <HI>Squakbeag,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Northfield,</HI> 50 miles up the river from <HI>Hadley.</HI></NOTE> where they &s;oon effected their de&s;ign, viz. to leaven the Indians on that &s;ide the coun|try with the &s;ame prejudice and malice again&s;t the En|gli&s;h. with which they them&s;elves were (though without cau&s;e) imbittered; for in a few days the device took place among&s;t <HI>Hadley</HI> and <HI>Deerfield</HI> Indians, and was pre&s;ently put in execution by the &s;aid Indians, withdrawing from the Engli&s;h and a&s;&s;i&s;ting <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Nipnets</HI> to &s;poil and de&s;troy all the towns we&s;tward, as &s;oon after came to pa&s;s: yet at the fir&s;t &s;ome of the <HI>Hadley</HI> Indians pre|tended real friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h, and offered them|&s;elves to fight again&s;t <HI>Philip,</HI> but the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians that came afterward from <HI>Martford</HI> began to &s;u&s;pect the treachery of the other, and told the Engli&s;h plainly, that no good would be done, while any of that company went along with them in pur&s;uit of the enemy, for as was &s;aid, they would always give &s;ome &s;hout when they came near the enemy, as if they &s;hould thereby wi&s;h them to look to them&s;elves; in&s;omuch that the &s;aid <HI>Hadley</HI> Indians &s;ell into great &s;u&s;picion with the En|gli&s;h, and for a proof of their fidelity, they were requir|ed to bring in their arms to the Engli&s;h, but upon that motion they delayed a little, but that very night they fled away from their dwellings, which was in a wooden fortification, within a mile of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> whereby they plainly di&s;covered that they had &s;ecretly plotted to join with <HI>Philip</HI>'s party, as far as they had an opportunity to do them any eminent &s;ervice. Some think the Eng|li&s;h failed in point of prudence, not managing that bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;o warily as they might, which if they had done, their defection had been prevented, but it is mo&s;t proba|ble that <HI>Philip</HI> had hired them to own his quarrel, by

In conclu|&s;ion, when they had &s;o fal&s;ly left their dwellings, and were running after <HI>Phillip</HI> and the <HI>Nipnet</HI> Indians (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t that time harboured in tho&s;e woods) the Engli&s;h were &s;o provoked that were under the Capts. <HI>Lothrop</HI> and <HI>Beers,</HI> that they pur&s;ued after them very early the next morning, and overtook them about ten miles above <HI>Hatfield,</HI> at a place called <HI>Sugarloaf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hill,</HI> and had a &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;h with them, wherein there were nine or ten of the Engli&s;h &s;lain, and about 26 Indians: Yet the re&s;t e&s;caped, and &s;o joined with <HI>Phillip</HI> and his company; pre&s;ently after which accident, they were &s;o emboldened, that upon the fir&s;t of <HI>Sept.</HI> about &s;even days after, they &s;et upon <HI>Deerfield,</HI> killed one man, and laid mo&s;t of the hou&s;es in a&s;hes.

<P>The next day, this di&s;a&s;ter not being known, Capt. <HI>Beers,</HI> for fear of the wor&s;t, with 36 men, was &s;ent up to the &s;aid <HI>Squakeag,</HI> with &s;upplies both of men and provi&s;ion to &s;ecure the &s;mall garri&s;on there, but before they came very near to the town, they were &s;et upon by many hundreds of Indians out of the bu&s;hes by a &s;wamp &s;ide. By this &s;udden &s;urprizal Capt. <HI>Beers</HI> (who was known to fight valiantly to the very la&s;t) with a|bout 20 of his men, were &s;lain, the re&s;t flying back to <HI>Hadley.</HI> Here the barbarous villians &s;hewed their in|&s;olent rage and cruelty, more than ever before, cutting off the heads of &s;ome of the &s;lain, and fixing them up|on poles near the highway, and not only &s;o, but one (if not more) was found with a chain hooked into his under jaw, and &s;o hung up on the bough of a tree, ('tis &s;eared he was hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt and di&s;courage any that might come

Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> going up after him, met him coming down, and would willingly have per&s;uaded them to have turned back, to &s;ee if they could have made any &s;poil upon the enemy, but the greate&s;t part advi&s;ed to the contrary, &s;o that they were all forced to return with what they could carry away, leaving the re&s;t for a booty to the enemy, who &s;hall are long pay a &s;ad reckoning for their robberies and cruel|ties, in the time appointed: But the &s;ufferings of the Engli&s;h were not as yet come to their height, for after they were come to <HI>Hadley,</HI> the commander in chief taking coun&s;el with the officers of the &s;oldiers, ordered them that were then pre&s;ent to garri&s;on the towns a|bout; &s;ome to be at <HI>Northampton, Hatfield</HI> and <HI>Deer|field,</HI> and &s;ome to remain at <HI>Hadley,</HI> where were the head-quarters of the Engli&s;h.

It came to Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI>'s turn, or rather it was his choice with about So men to guard &s;everal carts laden with corn, and o|ther goods. The company under Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> then quartering at <HI>Deerfield</HI> intended that day to pur&s;ue af|ter the enemy.

For the Indians, notwith&s;tanding their &s;ubtilty and cruelty, dur&s;t not look an Engli&s;hman in the face in the open field, nor ever yet were known to kill any man with their guns, unle&s;s when they could lie in wait for him in an ambu&s;h, or behind &s;ome &s;helter, taking aim un|di&s;covered, &s;o that although it was judged by tho&s;e that e&s;caped, that there were 7 or 800 Indians at lea&s;t that encountred that company of 80 Engli&s;h, yet if

<P>THIS &s;ore defeat of Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI> and his men, was the more to be lamented, in that (falling out &s;o &s;oon after two other of the like nature) it &s;o emboldened the enemy, that they dur&s;t &s;oon after adventure upon con&s;iderable towns, though well garri&s;oned with &s;ol|diers, and gave them occa&s;ion of the mo&s;t in&s;olent braving the garri&s;on at <HI>Deerfield</HI> the next day, hanging up the garments of the Engli&s;h in &s;ight of the &s;oldiers, yet on the other &s;ide of the river.

<P>ON the other hand, it was con&s;idered, that if the enemy were let alone till the next &s;ummer, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to deal with them, or find them any where, but they might wa&s;te one company of &s;oldiers after another, as was &s;een by the experience of the former year.

<P>IT was therefore finally agreed upon by the general con&s;ent of all, to fall upon the winter quarters of our enemies, by a more con&s;iderable army (if I may &s;o call it) gathered out of all the three colonies, and that with all expedition, at farthe&s;t not to exceed the 10th of <HI>December,</HI> before they &s;hould have a thou&s;and men in arms, ready for the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>AS for the late league made or rather renewed with the <HI>Narrhaghan&s;ets,</HI> it was &s;ufficiently evident and known, that they had all along from the fir&s;t day when it was confirmed, broken every article of it, e&s;pecially in not delivering up the enemies, which had

And be&s;ides, the favouring of tho&s;e that fled to them, and &s;upplying the whole body of the enemy with victuals, upon all occa&s;ions. It was likewi&s;e &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that in all the late proceed|ings of the enemy, many of their young men were known to be actually in arms again&s;t us, many of whom were found either wounded among&s;t them in their wigwams, or el&s;ewhere occa&s;ionally &s;een return|ing back, after exploits abroad, to be healed of their wounds at home. Al&s;o &s;ome of our mens guns that were lo&s;t at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> were found in the fort when it was fined. Therefore all &s;cruples as to the ju&s;tne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of the war being removed, the only que&s;tion was, whether it were fea&s;ible and expedient in the win|ter. The exigent was very great, and the choice very hard: But as David when he was &s;treightened with many difficulties at once, cho&s;e rather to fall in|to the hands of God who&s;e mercies were great, though he might be provoked to cau&s;e his jealou&s;y to &s;moak again&s;t tho&s;e of his own heritage for a time; &s;o in this exigent it was generally conceived to be mo&s;t ex|pedient for the country, to ca&s;t them&s;elves upon the providence of a merciful and gracious God, rather than by delays to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the treachery and cruelty of a perfidious enemy.</P>
<P>A WAR therefore &s;peedily to be carried on in the very depth of winter. being agreed upon, care was taken for &s;upplies, as the difficulty of &s;uch an affairs &s;o circum&s;tanced did require, though po&s;&s;ibly not with &s;o much nece&s;&s;ary care, and &s;o &s;uitable provi&s;ion, as had been de&s;ired, if what came afterward to pa&s;s could have been fore&s;een (which peradventure might be the rea&s;on things went on &s;o heavily for want of well oil|ing the wheels) in the mean time a &s;mall army of a a thou&s;and fighting men, well appointed, were or|dered

<P>THE next day, <HI>December</HI> the 12th, they pa&s;&s;ed over <HI>Patuxet</HI> river, and then marching through <HI>Pomham</HI>'s country; at night they met with Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> and his company, at Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s in <HI>Wickford,</HI> the place in|tended for their head-quarters. Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> in his way thither had happily &s;urpri&s;ed 36 Indians, one of whom he took along with him as a guide, <HI>Peter</HI> by name, that was at that time under &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t with his country-men, or his Sachem, which made him prove the more real friend to our forces in that &s;ervice, wherein he faithfully performed what he promi&s;ed, and without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance our men would have been much at a lo&s;s to have found the enemy, until it had been too late to have fought them.</P>
<P>Two days after, <HI>December</HI> 14th, five files of men &s;ent out under &s;erjeant <HI>Bonnet,</HI> and another, upon the &s;cout, killed one man and one woman, and brought in four more by one of the clock: The whole com|pany marched after into &s;ome of the Sachem's country, where they burnt an 150 wigwams, killed 7 of the enemy, and brought in 8 pri&s;oners when they return|ed at night.</P>
<P>THE next day an Indian called <HI>Stone wall John,</HI> pretended to come from the Sachems, intimating their willingne&s;s to have peace with the Engli&s;h, yet could the me&s;&s;enger hardly for bear threatning, vapour|ing of their numbers and &s;trength, adding wichal that the Engli&s;h dur&s;t not fight them: Whatever were pre|tend by this treacherous fellow, &s;ome of his crew as he want home met with &s;ome of Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI>'s men, that were &s;tragling about their own bu&s;ine&s;s, contrary

Two al&s;o of Capt. <HI>Oliver</HI>'s men were killed in like manner; a &s;olemn warning for &s;oldiers not to be too venterous in an enemy's country. For preventing the like mi&s;chief upon other companies, more care was taken as they pa&s;&s;ed to the head-quarters, &s;ome of the companies being lodged three miles therefrom. Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI>'s, Capt. <HI>Dapenport</HI>'s, and Capt. <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Com|panies being al&s;o &s;ent about that time to bring Major. <HI>Appleton</HI>'s to the general quarters, a few de&s;perate In|dians creeping under a &s;tone wall near the place, fired twenty or thirty guns at <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> in particular, a commander well known among&s;t them, but the re&s;t of the company running down upon them, killed one of them, and &s;cattered the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next day Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> with his troop, be|ing &s;ent to <HI>Pettyquam&s;cot,</HI> returned with the &s;ad news of burning <HI>Jerry Bull</HI>'s garri&s;on hou&s;e, and killing 10 Engli&s;h men and five women and children, but two e&s;caped in all. This is the chance of war which they who undertake, mu&s;t prepare to undergo.</P>
<P>THE next day brought from the &s;ame place a little better news, though not enough to balance the &s;orrow of the former, viz. that <HI>Connecticut</HI> forces were come thither with three hundred Engli&s;h, and an hundred and fifty <HI>Mohegins,</HI> ready fixed to war on the behalf of the Engli&s;h again&s;t the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> their mortal enemies; and by the way meeting a party of the ene|my, they &s;lew 5 or 6 of them and took as many pri|&s;oners. The whole number of all our forces being now come, the want of provi&s;ion with the &s;harpne&s;s of the cold, minded them of expedition, wherefore the very next day, the whole body of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> and <HI>Pli|mouth</HI> forces marched away to <HI>Pettyquam&s;cot</HI> intending to engage the enemy upon the fir&s;t opportunity that next offered it&s;elf: To the which re&s;olution tho&s;e of <HI>Connecticut</HI> pre&s;ently con&s;ented, as &s;oon as they met together, which was about five o'clock in the afternoon: <HI>Bull</HI>'s hou&s;e intended for their general rendezvous, being unhappily burnt down two or three days before,
<PB N="104" REF="014120_0134_0F93026FE6C0CAA8">there was no &s;helter left either for officers or private &s;oldiers, &s;o as they were nece&s;&s;itated to march on to|ward the enemy through the &s;now, in a cold &s;tormy evening, finding no other defence all that night, &s;ave the open air, nor any other covering than a cold and moi&s;t fleece of &s;now. Through all the&s;e difficulties they marched from the break of the next day, <HI>Decem|ber</HI> 19th, till one of the clock in the afternoon, with|out either fire to warm them, or re&s;pite to take any food, &s;ave what they could chew in their march. Thus having waded fourteen or fifteen miles through the country of the old Queen, or <HI>Sunke Squaw</HI> of <HI>Narrha|gan&s;et,</HI> they came at one o'clock upon the edge of the &s;wamp where their guide a&s;&s;ured them they &s;hould find Indians enough before night.</P>
<P>OUR forces chopping thus upon the &s;eat of the ene|my, upon the &s;udden, they had no time either to draw up in any order or form of battle, nor yet opportunity to con&s;ult where or how to a&s;&s;ault. As they marched Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> and Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> led the van, Major <HI>Appleton</HI> and Capt. <HI>Oliver</HI> brought up the rear of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> forces; General <HI>Win&s;low</HI> with the <HI>Pli|mouth</HI> forces marched in the centre; tho&s;e of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> came up in the rear of the whole body: But the frontiers di&s;cerning Indians in the edge of the &s;wamp, fired immediately upon them, who an&s;wer|ing our men in the &s;ame language, retired pre&s;ently into the &s;wamp, our men followed them in amain, without &s;taying for the word of command, as if every one were ambitious who &s;hould go fir&s;t, never making any &s;tand till they came to the &s;ides of the fort, into which the Indians that fir&s;t fired upon them betook them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems that there was but one enterance into the fort, tho' the enemy found many ways to come out, but neither the Engli&s;h or their guide well knew on which &s;ide the enterance lay; nor was it ea&s;y to have made another; wherefore the good providence of Almighty God is the more to be acknowledged, who as he led
<PB N="105" REF="014120_0135_0F9302710559B488"><HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;ometimes by the pillar of fire, and the cloud of his pre&s;ence, a right way thro' the wilderne&s;s, &s;o did he now direct our forces upon that &s;ide of the fort, where they might only enter through not without utmo&s;t danger and hazard. The fort was rai&s;ed upon a kind of i&s;land of five or &s;ix acres of ri&s;ing land in the mid&s;t of a &s;wamp; the &s;ides of it were made of palizadoes, &s;et upright, the which was compa&s;&s;ed about with an hedge of almo&s;t a rod thickne&s;s, through which there was no pa&s;&s;ing, unle&s;s they could have fired a way through, which then they had no time to do. The place where the Indians u&s;ed ordinarily to enter them&s;elves, was upon a long tree over a place of water, where but one man could enter at a time, and which was &s;o way-laid that they would have been cut off that had ventured there: But at one corner there was a cap made up only with a long tree, about four or five foot from the ground, over which men might ea&s;ily pa&s;s: But they had placed a kind of a block-hou&s;e right over again&s;t the &s;aid tree, from whence they &s;orely galled our men that fir&s;t entered, &s;ome being &s;hot dead upon the tree, as Capt. <HI>John&s;on;</HI> and &s;ome as &s;oon as they entered, as was Capt. <HI>Davenport;</HI> &s;o as they that fir&s;t entered were forced pre&s;ently to retire, and fall upon their bellies till the fury of the enemy's &s;hot was pretty well &s;pent, which &s;ome companies that did not di&s;cern the danger, not ob&s;erving, lo&s;t &s;undry of their men, but at the la&s;t two companies being brought up, be&s;ides the four that fir&s;t marched up, they animated one another, to make another a&s;&s;ault, one of the commanders crying out, they run, they run, which did &s;o encourage the &s;oldiers that they pre&s;ently entered amain. After a con&s;iderable number were well entered, they pre|&s;ently beat the enemy out of a flanker on the left hand, which did a little &s;helter our men from the enemy's &s;hot, till more company came up, and &s;o by degrees made up higher, fir&s;t into the middle, and then into the upper end of the fort, till at la&s;t they made the enemy all retire from their &s;conces, and fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead bodies upon the place. <HI>Connecticut</HI> &s;oldiers marching up in the rear, being not
<PB N="106" REF="014120_0136_0F93027170533F10">aware of the dangerous pa&s;&s;age over the tree, in com|mand of the enemy's block-hou&s;e, were at their fir&s;t enterance many of them &s;hot down, although they came on with as gallant re&s;olution as any of the re&s;t, under the conduct of their wi&s;e and valiant leader, Major <HI>Treat.</HI></P>
<P>THE brunt of the battle, or danger that day lay mo&s;t upon the commanders who&s;e part it was to lead on their &s;everal companies in the very face of death, or el&s;e all had been lo&s;t; &s;o as all of them with great valour and re&s;olution of mind, as not at all afraid to die in &s;o good a cau&s;e, bravely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed on their men in that de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault; leaving their lives in the place as the be&s;t te&s;timony of their valour, and of love to the cau&s;e of God and their country: No le&s;s than fix brave Captains fell that day in the a&s;&s;ault, viz. Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gardner,</HI> Capt. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> be&s;ides Lieutenant <HI>Upham,</HI> who died &s;ome months after of his wounds received at that time. Capt. <HI>Gallop</HI> al&s;o, and Capt. <HI>Siely,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> were &s;lain of tho&s;e belonging to <HI>Connecticut</HI> colony. It is u&s;ually &s;een that the valour of the &s;oldiers is much wrapped up in the lives of their Commanders, yet was it found here, that the &s;oldiers were rather enraged than di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s of their Commanders, which made them redouble their courage, and not give back after they were entered the &s;econd time, till they had driven out their enemies: So after much blood and many wounds dealt on both &s;ides; the Engli&s;h &s;eeing their advantage, began to fire the wig|wams, where was &s;uppo&s;ed to be many of the enemies women and children de&s;troyed, by the firing of at lea&s;t five or &s;ix hundred of their &s;moaky cells.</P>
<P>IT is reported by them that fir&s;t entered the Indians fort, that our &s;oldiers came upon them when they were ready to dre&s;s their dinner, but our &s;udden and unexpected a&s;&s;ault put them be&s;ide that work, making their cook-rooms too hot for them at that time, when they and their mitchin fried together: And probably &s;ome of them eat their &s;uppers in a colder place that
<PB N="107" REF="014120_0137_0F930272201443D8">night: Mo&s;t of their provi&s;ion as well as their huts being then con&s;umed with fire, and tho&s;e that were left alive forced to hide them&s;elves in a cedar &s;wamp, not far off, where they had nothing to defend them from the cold but bought of &s;pruce and pine trees: For after two or three hours fight, the Engli&s;h became makers of the place, but not judging it tenable, after they had burned all they could &s;et fire upon, they were forced to retreat, after the day light was almo&s;t quite &s;pent, and were nece&s;&s;itated to retire to their quarters, full fifteen or &s;ixteen miles off, &s;ome &s;ay more, whither with their dead and wounded men they were to march, a difficulty &s;carce to be believed, as not to be paralleld almo&s;t in any former age.</P>
<P>IT is hard to &s;ay who acquitted them&s;elves be&s;t in that day's &s;ervice, either the &s;oldiers for their man|like valour in fighting, or the Commanders for their wi&s;dom and courage, leading on in the very face of death. There might one have &s;een the whole body of that little regimental army, as bu&s;y as bees in a hive, &s;ome bravely fighting with the enemy, others hauling off, and carrying away the dead and wounded men (which I rather note) that none may want the due te&s;timony of their valour and faithfulne&s;s, though all ought to &s;ay, <HI>not unto us, but unto thy name, O Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>FOR though there might not be above three or four hundred at any time within the fort at once, yet the re&s;t in their turns came up to do what the exigence of the &s;ervice required in bringing off the dead and wounded men: <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> regiment, together with Captain <HI>Mo&s;ely,</HI> was very &s;erviceable, for by that means the fort being clear of the dead bodies, it &s;truck a greater terror into the enemy, to &s;ee but eight or ten dead bodies of the Engli&s;h left, than to meet with &s;o many hundreds of their own &s;lain and wounded car|ca&s;es. The number of the &s;lain was not then known on the enemy's &s;ide, becau&s;e our men were forced to leave them on the ground: But our victory was found after|wards to be much more con&s;iderable than at the fir&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="014120_0138_0F930272ED2EF0B8">was apprehended; for although our lo&s;s was very great, not only becau&s;e of the de&s;peratene&s;s of the at|tempt it&s;elf (in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of the year, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from our quarters, whereby many of our wounded men peri&s;hed, which might otherwi&s;e have been pre&s;erved, if they had not been forced to march &s;o many miles in a cold &s;nowy night, before they could be dre&s;&s;ed) yet the enemy lo&s;t &s;o many of their principal fighting men, their provi&s;ion al&s;o was by the burning of their wigwams, &s;o much of it &s;poiled, at the taking of their fort, and by &s;urprizing &s;o much of their corn about that time al&s;o; that it was the oc|ca&s;ion of their total ruin afterwards: They being at that time driven away from their habitations, and put by from planting for the next year, as well as deprived of what they had in &s;tore for the pre&s;ent winter. What numbers of the enemy were &s;lain is uncertain, it was confe&s;&s;ed by one <HI>Poteck,</HI> a great Councellor among&s;t them, afterwards taken at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and put to death at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that the Indians lo&s;t 700 fight|ing men that day, be&s;ides 300 that died of their wounds, the mo&s;t of them: The number of old men, women and childen, that peri&s;hed either by fire, or that were &s;tarved with hunger and cold, none of them could tell. There was above 80 of the Engli&s;h &s;lain, and and 150 wounded, that recovered afterwards.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;everal circum&s;tances in this victory very remarkable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The meeting with one <HI>Peter</HI> a fugitive Indian, that upon &s;ome di&s;content, flying from the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> offered him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h, and did faithfully perform what he promi&s;ed, viz. to lead them to the &s;wamp where the Indians had &s;eated them&s;elves within a fort rai&s;ed upon an i&s;land of firm earth, in the mid&s;t of a &s;wamp, whither none of the Engli&s;h could have piloted them without his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, the place being near eighteen miles from the place where they were quartered.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their being by a &s;pecial providence di|rected ju&s;t to a place where they found &s;o ea&s;y enterance,
<PB N="109" REF="014120_0139_0F930273A5E11CF0">which if they had mi&s;&s;ed they could never have made a way through the hedge, with which they had &s;ur|rounded the pallizadoes of the fort in half a day's time.</P>
<P>AND Thirdly, If they had entered by the way left by the Indians for pa&s;&s;age, they might have been cut off, before they could have come near their fortifi|cation.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, In directing their motion to begin the a&s;|&s;ault ju&s;t at the day they did, for if they had deferred but a day longer, there fell &s;uch a &s;torm of &s;now the next day, that they could not have pa&s;&s;ed through it in divers weeks after: And on a &s;udden there fell &s;uch a thaw, that melted away both ice and &s;now, &s;o that if they had deferred till that time, they could have found no pa&s;&s;age into their fortified place.</P>
<P>ALL which con&s;iderations put together, make it a &s;ignal favour of God to carry them through &s;o many difficulties to accompli&s;h their de&s;ired end. For after they were retired to their quarters, but &s;ixteen miles from that place, there was &s;o great want of provi&s;ion, the ve&s;&s;els being frozen in at the harbour about <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> that &s;hould have brought them relief, and the fro&s;t and &s;now &s;et in &s;o violently, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them, with all the force they could make (&s;o many of their able&s;t &s;oldiers being &s;lain and wounded) to have made another on&s;et: But the goodne&s;s of Almigh|ty God was mo&s;t of all to be admired, that notwith|&s;tanding all the hard&s;hips they endured that winter, in very cold lodgings, hard marches, &s;carcity of provi&s;ion, yet not one man was known to die by any di&s;ea&s;e or bodily di&s;temper, &s;ave them that peri&s;hed of their wounds.</P>
<P>OUR forces being compelled by the afore&s;aid occa|&s;ions, to lie &s;till &s;ome weeks after, hoped al&s;o that the enemy &s;o &s;orely broken, would gladly have &s;ued for peace: But as was &s;aid of old, <HI>God hardened their
<PB N="110" REF="014120_0140_0F9302745D0BE9C0">hearts to their own ruin and de&s;truction afterwards.</HI> For us &s;oon as our &s;oldiers were able to march, finding that all the enemy's overtures of peace, and prolonging of treaties, was only to gain time, that they might get away into the woods; they pur&s;ued after them, and &s;ometimes came upon their rear, but then they would immediately fly an hundred ways at once into &s;wamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;o as our men could not follow them, or if they did, could not &s;ee two of them together; &s;o that now there was little good like to be done, unle&s;s they could take them at &s;ome advantage. At length having &s;pent all their provi&s;ion, and tiring them&s;elves in pur&s;uing of them &s;ixty or &s;eventy miles, up through the woods to|wards <HI>Marlborough</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> towns that lye on the road to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> having killed and taken near 70 of them, our &s;oldiers were ordered to return towards <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to recruit them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ing that the <HI>Narr|bagan&s;ets,</HI> and tho&s;e with them were &s;o enfeebled that they would have no mind &s;uddenly to a&s;&s;ault any of the Engli&s;h towns.</P>
<P>IF any de&s;ire a more particular account of the lo&s;s which we &s;u&s;tained at the taking of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> fort, <HI>December</HI> 19th, 1675, they may take it as here it follows:</P>

<P>IF there had not been &s;o great a di&s;tance between the place of the fight and their quarters, and &s;o much cold attending them in their retiring thereunto, &s;ome better account might have been given of that expedition, than now they were able to do. For a march of &s;ixteen or eighteen miles is too much to breathe a fre&s;h &s;oldier, unle&s;s he were well mounted; but enough to kill the heart of them that have been wearied with a long and tedious fight. As for the coldne&s;s of the weather, although it be a good be&s;om to &s;weep the chamber of the air (which might be the rea&s;on there was no more di&s;ea&s;es among&s;t them) yet it is an unwelcome com|panion to wearied, e&s;pecially to wounded men, in &s;o long a retreat.</P>
<P>BUT the want of provi&s;ion falling in, in conjunction with the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the weather, and length of the way, hindred our forces from any new attempt upon the enemy, which if they could have attended, it was thought it might have put an end to our troubles; but he that holdeth the &s;cales of victory in his hand, turpeth them to which &s;ide; and by what degrees plea&s;eth him be&s;t.</P>
<P>THE re&s;t of the winter was &s;pent in fruitle&s;s treaties about a peace; both &s;ides being well wearied with the late de&s;perate fight, were willing to refre&s;h them&s;elves the remaining part of the winter, with the &s;hort &s;lum|ber of a pretended peace, at lea&s;t with a talk or dream thereof: Our Comma&s;iders aim therein was chri&s;tian and good, if it had proceeded, <HI>&s;c.</HI> to have
<PB N="112" REF="014120_0142_0F930275E3C14E18">prevented the &s;hedding of more blood: And po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of the elder and wi&s;er of the enemy, did really de&s;ire what was pretended by them all (for they had now full proof of the valour and re&s;olution of the Engli&s;h, which &s;ome of them upon former &s;ucce&s;&s;es might be ready to que&s;tion) and they could not but &s;ee their de&s;truction already begun, in the lo&s;s of their dwellings, and all their provi&s;ions, as well as the &s;laughter of the be&s;t part of their fighting men; but through con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their barbarous treachery and fal&s;ehood, they could not tru&s;t others, and &s;o were willing to run the utmo&s;t hazard, as people hardened to their own de&s;truction. The particular pa&s;&s;ages of the treaty being carried on by the enemy only in pretence, and by our men (that &s;oon di&s;cerned their fraud) rather out of nece&s;&s;ity, to conceal their incapacity of engaging them anew, than any real expectation of a good effect, are not worthy the relating. However, though the foot were unable to do any &s;ervice in the depth of the &s;now, and &s;harpne&s;s of the cold, the troop was &s;ent out upon all occa&s;ions to &s;cout about the country, who brought in daily much of the enemy's corn and beans, which they had hid in barns under the ground, or at lea&s;t kept them from making u&s;e of their own provi&s;ion, or &s;poil|ing the Engli&s;h cattle; now and then al&s;o bringing in pri&s;oners from their quarters, as they were &s;tragling about to get victuals.</P>
<P>ON the 27th of <HI>December,</HI> Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Pomham</HI>'s country, where he burnt near an hundred wigwams, but found never an Indian in any of them.</P>
<P>ON the 28th of <HI>December,</HI> a &s;quaw was &s;ent to them, who had been taken in the fight, with a proffer of peace, if they would &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as were pro|pounded; the principal of which was, the delivering up all <HI>Philip</HI>'s Indians that were with them; the &s;quaw returned, not pretending that &s;he was lame and unable to come again; but the 30th of <HI>December,</HI> an Indian came from the Sachems, with &s;eeming thanks for the
<PB N="113" REF="014120_0143_0F930276AA534FD8">peace proffered, yet complained we made war upon them, and gave them no notice; but his mouth was &s;oon &s;topped, by the an&s;wer they made him: He owned, as the &s;quaw had &s;aid before, that they lo&s;t 300 of their be&s;t fighting men, and &s;o did two pri|&s;oners of theirs, taken <HI>January</HI> the 4th, whereof one being of <HI>Philip</HI>'s company, was put to death. The me&s;&s;enger that was &s;ent was fairly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with the expre&s;s mention of what terms they mu&s;t expect, if they de&s;ired a peace.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 4th, there came two me&s;&s;engers from them, as they &s;aid to make way for a treaty of peace; who laid the blame upon <HI>Canouchet,</HI> that came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, to confirm the peace with the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the united colonies, as if he had mi&s;in|formed them, viz. that they were not by the former treaty to have delivered up the <HI>Wompanoogs,</HI> or <HI>Philip</HI>'s Indians, until the &s;aid <HI>Canonchet</HI>'s brother, one of the ho&s;tages at <HI>Hartford,</HI> was relea&s;ed. This was but a mere pretence, for he and they too, better under&s;tood the particulars of the agreement: For by chance the articles which they had of the peace concluded with them, were found open (whether purpo&s;ely or acci|dentally was not known) in a wigwam in the fort, when it was taken, &s;o as they could not be ignorant of the articles of the agreement.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 5th, an Engli&s;h child of about three or four years old, taken from <HI>Warwick,</HI> was &s;ent in to put the better pretence upon the treaty mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 8th, the me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent back, and told what they mu&s;t tru&s;t to. In the afternoon a me&s;|&s;enger came from <HI>Ninigret,</HI> the old Sachem of <HI>Narr|bagan&s;et,</HI> who brought a letter from Mr. <HI>Stanton,</HI> the interpreter, &s;ignifying the reality of the &s;aid <HI>Ni|nigret,</HI> his friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h, and the &s;treights of the enemy, that corn was two &s;hillings a pint with them. Yet notwith&s;tanding all their difficulties, they rather delayed the time till they could get away, than
<PB N="114" REF="014120_0144_0F9302775A3AB0F0">really endeavoured the making a peace, as was &s;oon manife&s;t: For that young in&s;olent Sachem, <HI>Canonchet,</HI> and <HI>Panoquin,</HI> &s;aid they would fight it out to the la&s;t man, rather than they would become &s;ervants to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 10th, fre&s;h &s;upplies of &s;oldiers came up from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> wading through a &s;harp &s;torm of &s;now, that bit &s;ome of them by the heels with the fro&s;t. The next day one that came with them, going out with the &s;couts, fell among&s;t the Indians barns, in one of which, as he was groping to find corn for the relief of his hor&s;e, he catched hold of an Indian's hair, under the leaves, who pre&s;ently held up his hands, when the &s;oldier was drawing his &s;word, to &s;pare his life, which was granted, but after he was brought to the head|quarters, he would own nothing but what was forced out of his mouth, by the woolding of his head with a cord, wherefore he was pre&s;ently judged to die as a <HI>Wompanoog.</HI></P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 12th, another me&s;&s;enger came from <HI>Ca|nonicus,</HI> de&s;iring the &s;pace of a month longer, wherein to i&s;&s;ue the treaty, which &s;o provoked the Commander of our forces, that they re&s;olved to have no more trea|ties with the enemy, but prepare to a&s;&s;ault them, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;oon as ever the &s;ea&s;on would per|mit, and it was high time to take up that re&s;olution, for within a few day's after, they under&s;tood by &s;ome that were taken pri&s;oners, that the enemy were gone, or going into the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> country.</P>
<P>WITHIN a few days after, about the 16th of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> the &s;couts brought in one <HI>Jo&s;hua Tift,</HI> a rene|gado Engli&s;hman, of <HI>Providence,</HI> that upon &s;ome di&s;|content among&s;t his neighbours, had turned Indian, married one of the Indian &s;quaws, renounced his re|ligion, nation, and natural parents, all at once, fight|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them. He was taken by Capt. <HI>Fenner,</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> who with &s;ome of his neighbours were pur&s;uing &s;ome Indians that had driven away their cat|tle.
<PB N="115" REF="014120_0145_0F9302784C7915B0">This <HI>Tift</HI> being one of the company, was wound|ed in the knee, and &s;o was &s;eized by the Engli&s;h; he had in his habit conformed him&s;elf to them among&s;t whom he lived. After examination, he was con|demned to die the death of a traitor. As to his re|ligion he was found as ignorant as an heathen, which no doubt cau&s;ed the fewer tears to be &s;hed at his funeral, &s;tanders-by being unwilling to lavi&s;h pity upon him that had dive&s;ted him&s;elf of nature it&s;elf, as well as religion, in a time when &s;o much pity was needed el&s;ewhere, and nothing left be&s;ides wherewith to relieve the &s;uf|ferers.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 21&s;t. Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI>'s troop being abroad, met with a party of the enemy, of whom they took two pri&s;oners, and killed nine; in which exploit, &s;omething happened very remarkable, for one <HI>W. Dodge,</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> riding in company with another friend, they happened to meet with two Indians, the &s;aid <HI>Dodge</HI> be|ing better hor&s;ed than his friend, made after the fore|mo&s;t, leaving his friend to deal with the hindmo&s;t, but his pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ed firing, whereupon the Indian taking him by the leg, turned him off his hor&s;e, and getting upon him, was about killing him with his knife, which <HI>W. Dodge</HI> by chance e&s;pied, and came time enough to re&s;cue his friend, and di&s;patch the Indian lying upon him, and yet overtook the fir&s;t Indian he was pur&s;uing, time enough to do his bu&s;i|ne&s;s al&s;o: By that means he did three good offices at once, &s;aved the life of one friend, and &s;lew two of his enemies. But within two or three days after, the weather much altering from what it was, induced our forces to take the fir&s;t opportunity to pur&s;ue the enemy, who as they under&s;tood by me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Providence,</HI> were now upon their flight into the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> country: But &s;o many difficulties were ca&s;t in their way, that they could not be ready time enough to prevent the mi&s;chief they did at <HI>Warwick,</HI> as they took their farewell of their country.

They perceived al&s;o that the enemy dealt much in hor&s;e-fle&s;h, meeting with no le&s;s than &s;ixty hor&s;es heads in one place, which they had left behind them. Our &s;oldiers in their pur|&s;uit, came upon their rear, killed and took about &s;e|venty of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would pre&s;ently betake them&s;elves into &s;wamps, and not two of them run together, &s;o as they &s;aw it was an endle&s;s work to proceed further in the chace of &s;uch an enemy; but our forces having pur&s;ued them into the woods, between <HI>Marlborough</HI> and <HI>Brookfield,</HI> in the road toward <HI>Connecticut,</HI> were con&s;trained to turn down to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> for want of provi&s;ion, both for them&s;elves and their hor&s;es, which gave an occa&s;ion to the lo&s;s of tho&s;e le&s;|&s;er towns that were de&s;troyed by the <HI>Nipnet</HI> Indians, who pre&s;ently joined with the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> upon their fir&s;t approach, as &s;hall be related afterwards.</P>

Neither did they offer any uncivil carriage to any of the females, nor ever attempted the cha&s;tity of any of them, either being re&s;trained of God, as was <HI>Abimeleck</HI> of old, or by &s;ome other accidental cau&s;e which withheld them from doing any wrong in that kind.</P>
<P>UPON the report of this di&s;a&s;ter, Capt. <HI>Wad&s;worth,</HI> then at <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with about forty re&s;olute men, adventuring the re&s;cuing of the town that was remain|ing: And having recovered a bridge, they got over &s;afe, though the planks were pulled off by the enemy, and
<PB N="118" REF="014120_0148_0F93027D2A9A76B0">being led up in a way, not di&s;covered by them, they forced the Indians for the pre&s;ent to quit the place, after hey had burnt and de&s;troyed the better half of it. Yet afterwards it not being judged tenable, it was abandoned to the plea&s;ure of the in&s;ulting foe.</P>
<P>Ten days after they were &s;o flu&s;hed with this &s;uc|ce&s;s, that two or three hundred of them came wheeling down to <HI>Medfield,</HI> a town twenty miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> we&s;tward from <HI>Dedham,</HI> which they &s;urprized very earl in the morning (and though there were one hun|dred and &s;ixty &s;oldiers in it, or more, be&s;ides the in|habitants) they burnt near one half of the town, kill|ing about twenty per&s;ons, but by the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;oldiers, as &s;oon as they could be rallied together (it being at or before break of day, none in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch an a&s;&s;ault &s;o early) they were quickly forced to for&s;ake the place, and &s;o (not without &s;ome lo&s;s) took their way to <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony.</P>
<P>THE we&s;tern towns above <HI>Connecticut</HI> were the chief &s;eat of the war, and felt mo&s;t of the mi&s;chiefs thereof, in the end of the year 1675; but the &s;cene is now to be changed; and the other towns and villages that lye ea&s;tward, nearer <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> mu&s;t bear their part in the like tragedies: For as was &s;aid before, the <HI>Narrha|gan&s;ets</HI> having been driven out of the country, fled through <HI>Nipnet</HI> plantations, towards <HI>Watchu&s;et</HI> hills, meeting with all the Indians that had harboured all winter in tho&s;e woods about <HI>Na&s;haway,</HI> they all cam|bined again&s;t the Engli&s;h, yet divided their numbers, and one half of them were ob&s;erved to bend their cour&s;e toward <HI>Plimouth,</HI> taking <HI>Medfield</HI> in their way, which they endeavoured to burn and &s;poil, <HI>February</HI> 21&s;t, 1675, as their fellows had done <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> ten days before.</P>
<P>THE &s;urpri&s;al of this <HI>Medfield,</HI> in regard of &s;ome remarkable circum&s;tances it was attended with, is not unworthy a more particular relating as to the manner thereof: The lo&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> had &s;ufficiently awak|ened and alarmed the neighbouring villages, all to &s;tand upon their guard; and &s;ome had obtained gar|ri&s;oned &s;oldiers for their greater &s;ecurity, as was the

They began at the ea&s;t end of the town, where they fired the hou&s;e of one <HI>Samuel Mor&s;e,</HI> that &s;eems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have been a &s;ignal to the re&s;t, to fall in on other parts: Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the hou&s;es in the we&s;t, or &s;outh|we&s;t and of the town, were &s;oon burnt down: And generally when they burnt any out-hou&s;es, the cattle in them were burnt al&s;o. Two mills belonging to the town, were burnt al&s;o: A poor old man of near an hundred years old, was burnt in one of the hou&s;es that were con&s;umed by fire. The Lieutenant of the town, <HI>Adams</HI> by name, was &s;hot down by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own door, and his wife normally wounded by a gun fired afterwards accidentally into the hou&s;e.

The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the inhabitants amounted to above two thou&s;and pounds.

<P>ANOTHER a&s;&s;ault was feared, but as &s;oon as the &s;ol|diers could be gathered together, they turned their backs, as if they never intended to vi&s;it them more: whither the&s;e Indians went when they left <HI>Medfield,</HI> is not &s;o certainly known; the &s;oldiers in the town not having opportunity to pur&s;ue them over the river, by rea&s;on that the bridge was part of it burned: But it is mo&s;t probable that they took their way toward <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and continued about that &s;ide of the country for the future, waiting opportunities to do what mi&s;chief they could to the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts: For within a month after this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ult of <HI>Medfield,</HI> there was near fix hundred of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en about <HI>Pautuxet</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Pierce,</HI> with about fifty of his men were lo&s;t, though with no great advantage to the enemy, who at that time lo&s;t above double that number: Our worthy Captains in this and other exploits, being called

<P>CAPT. <HI>Pierce,</HI> as is &s;aid before, being &s;ent out to pur&s;ue the enemy, marched towards <HI>Pautuxet,</HI> where he under&s;tood the Indians were many of them gathered together: He being a man of re&s;olute courage, was willing to engage them though upon never at &s;o great di&s;advantage: Some &s;ay the Indians by counterfeiting, drilled him into a kind of ambu&s;h; po&s;&s;ibly more of them di&s;covered them&s;elves after he began to engage than he was aware of; and being got over the river in pur&s;uit of them, where he di&s;covered &s;o great a number of them, he drew down towards the &s;ide of the river, hoping the better by that means to prevent their &s;ur|rounding of him; but that proved his overthrow which he intended as his greate&s;t advantage: For the Indians getting over the river &s;o galled him from thence, that he was not able to defend him&s;elf; thus a&s;&s;aulted on all &s;ides, and him&s;elf not being able to travel much a foot, was thereby hindred from retiring to any better place in time, &s;o as he &s;aw him&s;elf con&s;trained to fight it out to the la&s;t, which he did with mo&s;t undaunted courage, and as is &s;aid, to the &s;laughter of an hundred and forty of his enemies, before him&s;elf and his company were cut off.

<P>IT is worth the noting, what faithfulne&s;s and courage &s;ome of the chri&s;tian Indians, with the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Pierce,</HI> &s;hewed in the fight: One of them, who&s;e name was <HI>Amos,</HI> after the Captain was &s;hot in his leg or thigh, &s;o as he was not able to &s;tand any longer, would not leave him, but charging his gun &s;everal times, fired &s;toutly upon the enemy, till he &s;aw that there was no po&s;&s;ibility for him to do any further good to Capt. <HI>Pierce,</HI> nor yet to &s;ave him&s;elf, if he &s;tayed any longer; therefore he u&s;ed this policy, perceiving the enemy had all blacked their faces, he al&s;o &s;tooping down, pulled out &s;ome blacking out of a pouch be carried with him, di&s;coloured his face therewith, and &s;o making him&s;elf look as like <HI>Hohamackco,</HI> as any of his enemies, he ran among&s;t them a little while, and was taken for one of them, as if he had been &s;earching for the Engli&s;h, until he had an opportunity to e&s;cape away among the bu&s;hes; therein imitating the cuttle fi&s;h, which when it is pur&s;ued, or in danger, ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth out of its body a thick humour, as black as ink, through which it pa&s;&s;es away un&s;een by the pur&s;uer.</P>

For the whole body of the Indians to the we&s;tward, tru&s;ting under the &s;hadow of that a&s;piring bramble; he took a kind of care of them upon him&s;elf: wherefore fore&s;eeing &s;o many hundreds could not well &s;ub&s;i&s;t without planting, he propounded it in his coun|cil, that all the we&s;t plantations upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> river, taken from the Engli&s;h, &s;hould this la&s;t &s;ummer be planted with Indian corn; which was indeed in it&s;elf a very prudent con&s;ideration: To that end he re&s;olved to venture him&s;elf with but thirty men (the re&s;t de|clining it) to fetch &s;eed-corn from <HI>Seaconk,</HI> the next town to <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> leaving a body of men, not few|er than fifteen hundred to follow him, or meet him about <HI>Seaconk</HI> the week after.

<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>New London, Norwich,</HI> and <HI>Stonington,</HI> apprehen&s;ive of their danger, by rea&s;on of the near bordering of the enemy, and upon other pru|dent con&s;iderations, voluntarily li&s;ted them&s;elves under &s;ome able gentlemen, and re&s;olute &s;oldiers, among&s;t them&s;elves, Major <HI>Palmes,</HI> Capt. <HI>George Deni&s;on,</HI> Capt. <HI>Avery,</HI> with whom, or under whom, within the com|pa&s;s of the year 1676, they made ten or more &s;everal expeditions, in all which, at tho&s;e &s;everal times, they killed and took two hundred and thirty-nine of the ene|my, by the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Pequods, Mohegins,</HI> and a few friendly <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets;</HI> be&s;ides thirty taken in the long march homeward, after the fort fight, <HI>December</HI> 19th, 1675; and be&s;ides &s;ixteen captivated in the &s;econd expedition, not reckoned within the compa&s;s of the &s;aid number; together with fifty guns, and &s;poiling the enemy of an hundred bu&s;hels of corn.</P>

IN all which exploits, neither they, nor any of their followers &s;u&s;tained any lo&s;s by the &s;word of the enemy, or &s;ickne&s;s; as is expre&s;ly declared by the Reverend Mini&s;ter of <HI>Stonington,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Noyee,</HI> which is a matter very admirable to con&s;ider, engaging all that were any way concerned in &s;uch &s;ignal te&s;timonies of divine favour, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ady to <HI>pay their vows to the Mo&s;t High,</HI> who alone <HI>teacheth the hands</HI> of his people <HI>to war, and their fingers to fight.</HI></P>

<P>The greate&s;t mi&s;chief which after this time was done by the enemy in <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, was by burning of hou&s;es and barns, which they might ea&s;ily do, the in|habitants in mo&s;t of tho&s;e towns being repaired to gar|ri&s;on hou&s;es for their greater &s;ecurity: For about the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> fifty of the enemy burnt about nineteen hou&s;es and barns at <HI>Scituate,</HI> but were &s;o re&s;olutely en|countered by a few of the inhabitants, that they were driven away, and thereby prevented from doing of fur|ther mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>NOT long after, <HI>May</HI> 8th, they burnt about &s;even|teen hou&s;es and barns in <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> a &s;mall town in <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, twelve miles on this &s;ide <HI>Taunton;</HI> but it plea&s;ed God ju&s;t at the time to &s;end a thunder|&s;hower, which put out the fire, or el&s;e it might have prevailed much further.</P>

<P>DURING the&s;e calamities, God's di&s;pen&s;ations have been very various, as well in reference unto towns and villages, as unto per&s;ons: As if &s;ome places had been by &s;pecial providence marked out to pre&s;ervation, as others unto de&s;truction; of which no other rea&s;on can be rendered according unto man, than the good plea|&s;ure of God &s;o to order and di&s;po&s;e of events, which <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>are all one to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean.</HI></P>

After they had marched five miles of their way, having Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>'s &s;on for their pilot, they met with &s;ome <HI>Swanzy</HI> people, newly turn|ed out of their hou&s;es (by which they were to pa&s;s) who having not as yet re&s;i&s;ted unto blood, yet ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e doleful lamentations, wringing of their hands, and be|wailing of their le&s;&s;es, very much al&s;o per&s;uading <HI>Bridgewater</HI> men to turn back, becau&s;e of the danger, but they having &s;o clear a call, had al&s;o more courage than cowardly to de&s;ert the cau&s;e of God and his peo|ple, le&s;t they &s;hould thereby betray the lives of &s;o many of their friends into the enemy's hands; and &s;o by the good hand of God towards them, came &s;afe to <HI>Meta|poi&s;et</HI> that night.</P>
<P>THE next day in the morning, a part of them went to guard Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> their pilot, back to his quarters; in their return they came &s;uddenly upon a party of Indians, about thirty in all; they were within &s;hot of one another, but the Engli&s;h having no commi&s;&s;ion to fight till they were a&s;&s;aulted, and not being impended in their pa&s;&s;age, they returned &s;afe to their garri&s;on at <HI>Metapoi&s;et:</HI> The Indians pre&s;ently drawing off, and firing three guns (though not with intent to do them any hurt, as was conceived) gave a &s;hout, and &s;o le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them.

<P>THE next week, fifteen of tho&s;e &s;oldiers looking after their hor&s;es, fell into an ambu&s;h of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared for the encounter, they di&s;charged their guns upon each other; but our men received no hurt, &s;ome of them felt the wind of the bullets pa&s;&s;ing by their faces; what damage the enemy received is uncertain, yet &s;ome of the Engli&s;h report they found &s;ome of their enemies dead bodies in the place afterward.</P>
<P>THUS were they not only pre&s;erved in many perils them&s;elves, but became in&s;trumental al&s;o for the pre|&s;ervation of mo&s;t of that garri&s;on, who with their goods, by their means, with the help of a &s;mall party of <HI>Pli|mouth</HI> forces, &s;ent thither after the &s;ix were killed (as is mentioned before) were &s;oon after tran&s;ported &s;afely to <HI>Read-I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>MANY outrages were that &s;ummer committed upon their neighbours at <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Nama&s;ket,</HI> yet it plea&s;ed God to protect this poor town of <HI>Bridgewater</HI> from any

<P><HI>April</HI> 9th, being Lord's day, a &s;mall party of the enemy came down upon the &s;aid <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> burnt an out hou&s;e and barn, broke up and rifled &s;everal other hou&s;es in the &s;ame quarter of the town, which are not|with&s;tanding yet remaining; they &s;ent out a party of their men to pur&s;ue them that night, and many days after, but could not hear of them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 7th, the Lord's day al&s;o (no doubt but the bet|terne&s;s of the day, will increa&s;e the badne&s;s of their deed attempted thereon) they had intelligence of a great body of Indians di&s;per&s;ed that way, with intent to have fallen upon the town that very day, but were ca&s;ually prevented by a great deal of rain that fell the night before; however, they were re&s;olved not to mi&s;s the opportunity, wherefore on the next day (<HI>May</HI> 8th) about three hundred of them, one <HI>Ti&s;guogen</HI> being their chief leader, at 8 or 9 in the morning made an a&s;&s;ault upon the eca&s;t end of the town, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river: Many of the inhabitants &s;tayed at home that morning, becau&s;e of the intelligence the day before, and &s;o were the more ready to entertain them; &s;ome that not taking that warning, ventured into the field about their occa&s;ions, were in danger of &s;urprizal, but by the &s;pecial favour of God e&s;caped, and came time enough to help defend their own and their neighbours dwellings, being &s;hot at, and hard pur&s;ued a con&s;i|derable way.</P>
<P>THE Indians pre&s;ently began to fire the town, but it plea&s;ed God &s;o to &s;pirit and encourage &s;everal of the

The Indians by this &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, being beaten off to the &s;kirts of the town, made a fre&s;h on&s;et upon another quarter thereof, on the north &s;ide of the river, where they had done much more mi&s;chief, but that God &s;tirred up &s;un|dry of the people to venture out of their fortified hou&s;es, who fired upon the enemy, and beat them from their dwellings, &s;o as in the evening they drew off to an out|hou&s;e, three miles di&s;tant from the town: The next day the inhabitants expected another a&s;&s;ault, but the enemy having burnt the hou&s;e and barn were they kept their rendezvous over night, and one hou&s;e more not far di&s;tant, they marched all clear away for that time.</P>
<P>THUS it plea&s;ed God &s;o to order his di&s;pen&s;ations toward this &s;mall town, as a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but ju&s;t ta&s;te of this bitter cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not &s;uch mercy, as the&s;e had, mixed therewith: Under God, the cou|rage of the inhabitants was a great means of their pre|&s;ervation, for they fired &s;o &s;toutly upon the enemy, that they dur&s;t not come very near any of the garri&s;oned hou&s;es, &s;aluting them only at a di&s;tance.

<P><HI>July</HI> 14th and 15th, another party of Indians came down upon the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the town, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s; for they had no commi&s;&s;ion from the Lord of Ho&s;ts to touch any of the per&s;ons of the inhabitants, their power reaching only to the &s;laying of their cattle at this time.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 18th, 19th, and 20th, they &s;ent our parties after the enemy to pur&s;ue them by their track, who fell upon &s;ome of them. On the 20th they took &s;ixteen, whereof two were men: On this day they had to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, it &s;eems, &s;ome of the Bay Indians, &s;ent them from Capt. <HI>Brattle;</HI> &s;ome of the captives informed that there were but &s;eventy or eighty in the company, and but ten or twelve men among&s;t them: But within a few days the&s;e <HI>Bridgewater</HI> men &s;hall find better &s;ucce&s;s in pur&s;uit of their enemies, when <HI>Philip</HI> him&s;elf &s;hall hardly e&s;cape their hands, as &s;hall be &s;een afterwards.</P>
<P>WHILE one party of the enemy thus acted their part in and and about <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, towards the &s;ea|coa&s;t, other parties of them were not idle in the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets</HI> colony, where they a&s;&s;aulted many places, doing what mi&s;chief they could by firing of hou&s;es, and killing &s;everal per&s;ons in the inland plantations.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 2d, they a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Groton;</HI> the next day over night Major <HI>Willard,</HI> with &s;eventy hor&s;e came into the town; forty foot al&s;o came up to their relief from <HI>Wa|tertown,</HI> but the Indians were all fled, having fir&s;t burnt all the hou&s;es in the town, &s;ave four that were garri&s;oned, the meeting-hou&s;e being the &s;econd hou&s;e they fired; &s;oon after Capt. <HI>Sill</HI> was &s;ent with a &s;mall party of dragoons, of eight files, to fetch off the inha|bitants of <HI>Groton,</HI> and what was left from the &s;poil of the enemy, having under his conduct about &s;ixty carts,

<P>THE &s;urprizal of <HI>Groton</HI> was after this manner: On <HI>March</HI> 2d, the Indians came in the night and rifled eight or nine hou&s;es, and carried away &s;ome cattle, and alarmed the town.</P>
<P>ON <HI>March</HI> 9th, about ten in the morning, a parcel of Indians (having two days lurked in the town, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of three out-hou&s;es, and fea&s;ted them|&s;elves with corn, divers &s;wine and poultry, which they there &s;eized) laid an ambu&s;h for two carts, which went from their garri&s;on to fetch in &s;ome hay, attended with four men, two of which e&s;pying the enemy, made a difficult e&s;cape, the other two were &s;et upon, and one of them &s;lain, &s;tript naked, his body mangled, and dragged into the high-way, and laid on his back in a mo&s;t &s;hameful manner: The other taken captive, and after &s;entenced to death; but the enemy not concurring in the manner of it, execution was deferred, and he by the providence of God e&s;caped by a bold attempt the night before he was de&s;igned to have been &s;laugh|tered, and fled to the garri&s;on at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the cattle in both towns wounded, and five of them &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 13th was the day when the enemy came in a full dody, by their own account four hundred, and
<PB N="139" REF="014120_0169_0F9302921CC2BF48">thought by the inhabitants to be not many le&s;s. The town was at this time (having been put into a fright by the &s;ad cata&s;trophe of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the next bordering town) gathered into five garri&s;ons, four of which were &s;o near together, as to be able to command from one to the other, between which were the cattle belonging to tho&s;e families, driven into pa&s;tures, which afterwards proved their pre&s;ervation; the other was near a mile di&s;tant from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS morning the Indians (having in the night placed them&s;elves in &s;everal parts of the town) made their on&s;et; which began near the four garri&s;ons; for a body of them having placed them&s;elves in ambu&s;cado, behind a hill, near one of the garri&s;ons, two of them made di&s;covery of them&s;elves, as if they had &s;tood up|on di&s;covery. At this time divers of the people, not &s;u&s;pecting any &s;uch matter (for the day before, many had been upon di&s;covery many miles, and found no &s;igns of an enemy being &s;o near) were attending their occa&s;ions, &s;ome foddering their cattle, &s;ome milking their cows, of whom the enemy might ea&s;ily have made a &s;eizure, but God prevented; they having another de&s;ign in hand, as &s;oon after appeared: The&s;e two Indians were at length e&s;pyed, and the alarm given; where|upon the mo&s;t of the men in the next garri&s;on, and &s;ome al&s;o in the &s;econd (which was about eight or nine pole di&s;tant) drew out and went to &s;urprize tho&s;e two Indians, who kept their &s;tation till our men reached the brow of the hill, then aro&s;e the ambu&s;h and di&s;|charged a volley upon them, which cau&s;ed a di&s;orderly retreat, or rather a rout, in which one was &s;lain, and three others wounded: Mean while another ambu&s;h had ri&s;en, and come upon the back &s;ide of the garri&s;on &s;o de&s;erted of men, and pulled down the pallizadoes: The &s;oldiery in this rout, retreated not to their own, but pa&s;&s;ed by to the next garri&s;on, the women and children mean while expo&s;ed to hazard, but by the goodne&s;s of God made a &s;afe e&s;cape to the other forti|fied hou&s;e, without any harm, leaving their &s;ub&s;tance to the enemy, who made a prey of it, and &s;pent the

No &s;ooner was the &s;ignal given by the fir&s;t volley of &s;hot, but immediately in &s;everal parts of the town at once, did the &s;moke ari&s;e, they firing the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the afternoon they u&s;ed a &s;tratagem not unlike the other, to have &s;urprized the &s;ingle garri&s;on, but God prevented. An old Indian, if an Indian pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treet with a black &s;heep on his back, with a &s;low pace, as one decrepid; they made &s;everal &s;hot at him, but mi&s;&s;ed him, at which &s;everal i&s;&s;ued out to have taken him alive, but the watchman &s;ea&s;onably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pying an ambu&s;h behind the hou&s;e, gave the &s;ignal, whereby they were prevented.</P>
<P>THE night following the enemy lodged in the town, &s;ome of them in the garri&s;on they had &s;urprized, but the body of them in an adjacent valley, where they made them&s;elves merry after their &s;avage manner. The next morning they gave two or three volleys at Capt. <HI>Parker</HI>'s garri&s;on, and &s;o marched off, fearing as was thought, that &s;upply might be nigh at hand. This a&s;&s;ault of theirs was managed with their wonted &s;ubtlety and barbarous cruelty; for they &s;tript the body of him whom they had &s;lain in the fir&s;t on&s;et, and then cutting off his head, fixed it upon a pole, looking towards his own land. The corp&s;e of the man &s;lain the week be|fore, they dug up out of his grave, they cut off his head and one leg, and &s;et them upon poles, and &s;tript off his winding &s;heet. An infant which they found dead, in the hou&s;e fir&s;t &s;urprized, they cut in pieces, which afterward they ca&s;t to the &s;wine. There were about forty dwelling hou&s;es burnt at that time, be&s;ides other buildings. This de&s;olation was followed with the breaking up of the town, and &s;cattering of the in|habitants, and removal of the candle&s;tick after it had been there &s;eated above twelve years.</P>

CONCERNING the &s;urprizing of <HI>Groton, March</HI> 13, there was not any thing much more material than what is already mentioned, &s;ave only the in&s;olency of <HI>John Monoco,</HI> or <HI>one eyed John,</HI> the chief Captain of the Indians in that de&s;ign; who having by a &s;udden &s;ur|prizal, early in the morning, &s;eized upon a garri&s;on hou&s;e in one end of the town, continued in it, plunder|ing what was there ready at hand, all that day; and at night did very familiarly in appearance, call out to Capt. <HI>Parker,</HI> that was lodged in another garri&s;on hou&s;e, and entertained a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with him, whom he called his old neighbour; dilating upon the cau&s;e of the war, and putting an end to it by a friendly peace; yet oft mixing bitter &s;arca&s;ams, with &s;everal bla&s;phemous &s;coffs and taunts, at their praying and wor&s;hiping God in the meeting-hou&s;e, which he derid|ingly &s;aid he had burnt.

<P>THE danger which the&s;e inland towns were like to be expo&s;ed unto from the enemy, after they were dri|ven out of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country, was fore&s;een by the Council of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> yea they had &s;ome intimation thereof from the enemy them&s;elves; but they were not well able to prevent it in that un&s;ea&s;on|able time of the year; no way fit for marching of &s;ol|diers, and tran&s;porting of provi&s;ions (the winter then beginning to break up in this country) for while our forces were up in the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country in the win|ter, a couple of chri&s;tan Indians were &s;ent as &s;pies into the <HI>Nipnet</HI> and <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country, through the woods, in the depth of winter, when the ways were impa&s;&s;able for any other &s;ort of people: The&s;e two, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> ordered their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o prudently, as that they were admitted into tho&s;e Indian habitations as friends, and had free liberty of di&s;cour&s;e with them; they were at the fir&s;t a little jealous of them, but by the means of <HI>one-eyed John</HI> (a great Captain of the Indians, that afterwards led them that &s;poiled <HI>Groton,</HI> who ha|ving been a companion of one of the &s;aid &s;pies, both in hunting, and in fighting again&s;t the <HI>Mohawks</HI> formerly; &s;o e&s;teemed of him, that he would not &s;uffer any of the re&s;t to touch him) they pa&s;&s;ed through all the In|dian

<P>BUT our &s;orrows and lo&s;&s;es that day are not yet come to their height; for in the after part of the &s;ame day, that re&s;olute &s;tout-hearted &s;oldier, Capt. <HI>Wad&s;worth</HI> (who had not long before, with not above forty men, re&s;cued <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> when it was in danger to have been all lo&s;t at once) being &s;ent from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with fifty &s;oldiers to relieve <HI>Marlborough,</HI> having marched twenty-five miles, and then under&s;tanding the enemy was gone through the woods toward <HI>Sudbury:</HI> This unwearied company, before ever they had taken any con&s;iderable re&s;t, marched immediately back toward <HI>Sudbury</HI> (that lies ten miles nearer <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) and being come within a mile of the town, they e&s;pyed a party of Indians not far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they conceived, the&s;e they might ea&s;ily deal with; who retiring back a while, drew Capt. <HI>Wad&s;worth</HI> and his company above a mile into the woods, when on a &s;ud|den a great body of the enemy appeared, about five hundred as was thought, who compa&s;&s;ing them around, forced them to the top of an hill, where they made very &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance a con&s;iderable while; but the night

<P>THUS as in former attempts of like nature too much courage and eagerne&s;s in pur&s;uit of the enemy, hath added another fatal blow to this poor country.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day another party of the Engli&s;h coming from <HI>Brookfield,</HI> whither they were &s;ent as a convoy with provi&s;ion for the garri&s;on, were in danger likewi&s;e of falling in the hands of the &s;ame Indians, yet riding upon a good &s;peed, and keeping their guns always rea|dy pre&s;ented again&s;t them they met, they never dur&s;t fire at them; only three or four having unadvi&s;edly fir&s;t di&s;charged their guns again&s;t the enemy, and fall|ing too much in the rear of their company, were cut off and lo&s;t. It is reported by &s;ome that afterwards e&s;caped, how they cruelly tortured five or &s;ix of the Engli&s;h that night: Yet whatever their &s;ucce&s;s was this day, it was ob&s;erved by &s;ome (at that time their pri&s;oners, and &s;ince relea&s;ed) that they &s;eemed very pen&s;ive after they came to their quarters, &s;hewing no &s;uch &s;igns of rejoicing as they u&s;ually were wont to do in like ca&s;es; whether for the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their own company in that day's enterprize (&s;aid to be an hundred an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> twenty) or whether it were the Devil in whom
<PB N="149" REF="014120_0179_0F93029C1974FBA8">they tru&s;ted, that deceived them, and to whom they made their addre&s;s the day before, by &s;undry conju|rations of their powawes? Or whether it were by any dread that the Almighty &s;ent upon their &s;pirits, upon their execrable bla&s;phemies, which tis &s;aid they u&s;ed in the torturing of &s;ome of their poor captives (bidding Je&s;us come and deliver them out of their hands from death, if he could) we leave as uncertain, though &s;ome have &s;o reported, yet &s;ure it is that after this day, they never pro&s;pered in any attempt they made again&s;t the Engli&s;h, but were continually &s;cattered and broken, till they were in a manner all con&s;umed. After this time, however they had braved it before, they &s;eemed to ap|prehend that it was &s;carce fea&s;ible for them to with&s;tand the power of the Engli&s;h, and therefore &s;eemed more inclinable to a peace, by &s;everal overtures made by them, if they knew how to have brought it about. For during the&s;e encounters they were willing to admit of &s;ome kind of treaty with the Engli&s;h, about the relea&s;ing of &s;undry of their captives, which they took at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, and el&s;ewhere: To this end &s;undry attempts were made by help of &s;everal of the praying Indians (as they were called) about the re|demption of &s;ome of the women and children, which were at that time in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by degrees &s;omething was effected that way; po&s;&s;ibly their own pre&s;ent &s;ufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce them thereunto: For by this time the &s;pring of the year came on, their provi&s;ion was all &s;pent, and they forced to live wholly upon ground nuts, and upon the fle&s;h of the Engli&s;h creatures, both hor&s;e and near cattle, which they daily plundered. The ground nuts running up to &s;eed in the &s;ummer, begin to grow &s;o &s;ticky, as they were &s;carce eatable; the fle&s;h al&s;o of the Engli&s;h cattle proving unwhol&s;ome for their bodies, filling them with &s;undry di&s;ea&s;es: One of them having eaten much hor&s;e-fie&s;h, complained that he had before eaten hor&s;e, and now hor&s;e began to eat him, meaning &s;ome deadly di&s;ea&s;e growing upon his eating &s;uch rank fle&s;h, unwhol&s;ome for their bodies, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="150" REF="014120_0181_0F93029CE229A2D0">without falt, as their u&s;ual manner is. The fi&s;h|ing &s;ea&s;on al&s;o began now to come in, wherein they u&s;e to take abundance of all &s;orts, with which tho&s;e great rivers up the country are abundantly &s;tored; they u&s;ed to take thereof, and drying it in the &s;moke, make provi&s;ion thereof for the greate&s;t part of the year; and if the war continued, they could not but &s;ee they &s;hould utterly be cut off therefrom; and that if the planting &s;ea&s;on al&s;o were lo&s;t, they &s;hould be in great want of &s;ummer fruits, <HI>&s;c.</HI> beans and &s;qua&s;hes (be&s;ides their corn) with which they were wont to live all the latter part of the &s;ummer. Upon all con&s;iderations they &s;eemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though &s;ome were apt to think they would never have kept it, further than would &s;tand with their own advantage, and that their pre&s;ent de&s;ire thereof was only to gain time.</P>
<P>A PERSON formerly acquainted with the Indians about <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> did adventure upon the forementioned overtures, to go among&s;t them to try if he could not prevail with them for the redemption of the mini&s;ter's wife, taken captive in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, from <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and through the favour of him who having the hearts of all in his hand, inclines them as he plea&s;es, obtained the de&s;ired end upon an incon&s;iderable &s;um, which gave encouragement to the council to &s;end two me&s;|&s;engers on the like errand the &s;ame week, to procure the redemption of others, not without &s;ucce&s;s: The former, viz. Mrs. <HI>Rowland&s;on</HI> being brought to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> upon the election day, <HI>May</HI> 3d, it was generally look|ed at as a &s;mile of providence, and doubtle&s;s was a re|turn of prayer, and an&s;wer of faith, with which her hu&s;band had been upheld, and &s;upported from the day of her captivity; his two children al&s;o were returned back not long after, more by the over-ruling hand of God (<HI>that turns the captivity of his people as the &s;treams of the &s;outh;</HI> and &s;ometimes inclining them to pity his &s;ervants, that are of them&s;elves more cruel than the &s;ea mon&s;ters) than by any other contrivance of man's policy.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="014120_0180_0F93029DEC9E7C40">
AND yet notwith&s;tanding motions of this nature a|bout the redemption of &s;ome of our pri&s;oners &s;till in their hands, there was no ce&s;&s;ation of arms between us.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time letters were &s;ent down from <HI>Con|necticut</HI> colony, informing the general court then a&s;|&s;embled at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that &s;ome of the <HI>Mohawks</HI> (a &s;ort of fierce and &s;avage Indians, yet mortal enemies to the&s;e we were at war with) had fallen upon &s;ome of <HI>Philip</HI>'s party, and de&s;troyed many of them: Like|wi&s;e that many of them were de&s;troyed by fevers and fluxes, with other di&s;tempers falling among&s;t them, which was &s;ome reviving to our hopes, that the foot of our enemy &s;hould &s;lide in due time, and that de&s;truc|tion was ha&s;tening upon them, though &s;till they were permitted to do mi&s;chief in &s;undry particular places of the country, which mu&s;t be minded as we pa&s;s along.</P>
<P>THOSE Indians that were our profe&s;&s;ed enemies, af|ter they had been beaten out of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> coun|try, <HI>February</HI> 1&s;t, tarried a while at <HI>Winimazeag,</HI> a place two day's journey north of <HI>Quabaog,</HI> where they divided them&s;elves into two companies, one of them tarried on that &s;ide the county, the other made toward <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, taking <HI>Medfield</HI> in their way, from whence as they marched along they met with a notable repul&s;e at <HI>Boggi&s;ton,</HI> a &s;mall hamlet, or company of farms not far from the &s;aid <HI>Medfield,</HI> where they at|tempted a garri&s;on, but meeting with &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, they left the enterprize, and kept on their way toward <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, where they &s;cattered them&s;elves up and down, waiting for opportunities to &s;poil and de|&s;troy the Engli&s;h plantations on that &s;ide of the coun|try.</P>
<P>BESIDES what is already mentioned, on <HI>May</HI> 11th, a party of them a&s;&s;aulted the town of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> burnt eleven hou&s;es, and five barns belonging thereunto: On the other &s;ide, a &s;mall party of the Engli&s;h &s;couting about in pur&s;uit of the Indians, fell upon a party of

<P>WITHIN a few days after this, &s;even hou&s;es and two barns more were burnt by the enemy in and a|bout <HI>Plimouth;</HI> who did the like mi&s;chief about the &s;ame time to the remaining hou&s;es of <HI>Nama&s;ket</HI> or <HI>Mid|dleborough.</HI></P>

Two more hou&s;es about <HI>Shaw&s;kin,</HI> beyond the &s;aid <HI>Andover,</HI> were burnt about <HI>March</HI> 10th: Al&s;o they killed a young man of the &s;aid town, <HI>April</HI> 8th, the &s;on of <HI>George Abbot;</HI> and another &s;on of his al&s;o was carried away the &s;ame day, who notwith&s;tand|ing was returned &s;ome few months after, almo&s;t pined to death with hunger.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time they killed &s;ome of their cattle, cutting out only the tongues of &s;ome of them for ha&s;te,
<PB N="153" REF="014120_0183_0F93029F290A5CE8">being &s;hot at by &s;everal of the inhabitants from their garri&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 10th, at <HI>Concord</HI> two men going for hay, one of them was killed. At <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Wame&s;it</HI> Indians, about <HI>March</HI> 18th before, fell upon &s;ome hou&s;es on the north &s;ide of the river; burnt down three or four that belonged to the family of <HI>Edward Colburn:</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Colburn,</HI> with <HI>Samuel Varnham,</HI> his neigh|bour, being pur&s;ued, as they pa&s;&s;ed over the river to look after their cattle on that &s;ide of the river; and making &s;everal &s;hote again&s;t them, who returned the like again upon the &s;aid Indians, (judged to be about forty) what &s;ucce&s;s they had upon the enemy, was be&s;t known to them&s;elves; but two of <HI>Varnham</HI>'s &s;ons were &s;lain by the enemy's &s;hot before they could re|cover the other &s;ide of the river. <HI>April</HI> 15th al&s;o, were fourteen or fifteen hou&s;es burnt there.</P>
<P>NOT long before this, <HI>February</HI> 1&s;t, 1676, <HI>Tho|mas Eames</HI> that kept a farm at <HI>Sudbury,</HI> who&s;e dwell|ing was three or four miles out of town, had his hou&s;e a&s;&s;aulted and fired, his wife killed, and his children carried captive among the Indians.</P>
<P>ALSO two men were killed at a farm about <HI>Concord, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob Shepard</HI> by name, about the middle of <HI>February,</HI> and a young maid that was &s;et to watch up|on a hill, of about fifteen years of age, was carried captive, who &s;trangely e&s;caped away upon an hor&s;e that the Indians had taken from <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> a little before. In the like &s;trange manner did one of <HI>Eames</HI>'s children e&s;|cape away about <HI>May</HI> 3d la&s;t, travelling thirty miles a|lone in the woods, without any relief till he came to an Engli&s;h town. <HI>Eames</HI>'s hou&s;e was a&s;&s;aulted when he was from home, by an Indian called <HI>Netus</HI> (not long after &s;lain at <HI>Marlborough</HI>) which had been very famili|ar with the Engli&s;h, with nine or ten more of his com|pany, as perfidious and barbarous as him&s;elf. They burned all the dwellings that belonged to the farm, corn, hay and cattle, be&s;ides the dwelling-hou&s;e with

<P>MANY &s;uch-like remarkable in&s;tances of &s;pecial providences might be mentioned, if it were convenient to in&s;ert &s;uch particular pa&s;&s;ages into the general narra|tive of the late troubles with our barbarous enemies.</P>
<P>ON <HI>May</HI> 3d a party of them killed a man at <HI>Ha|verhill,</HI> upon the edge of <HI>Merrimack-River,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing over the &s;aid River to <HI>Bradford,</HI> &s;poiled another fami|ly, killing one <HI>Thomas Kimball,</HI> and carrying his wife and five children captive, forty miles up in the woods; although it was que&s;tioned whether this la&s;t mi&s;chief was done by any of <HI>Philip</HI>'s party, but rather by &s;ome that belonged to the Ea&s;tward Indians, of which there may be occa&s;ion, God willing, to &s;peak more of afterward.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the&s;e in&s;olencies &s;everal com|panies of fre&s;h &s;oldiers both hor&s;e and foot were rai&s;ed in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> by the governor and council of that colony, and &s;ent out to &s;uppre&s;s the common enemy; the foot under the command of the Captains <HI>Sill, Cut|ler</HI> and <HI>Holbrook;</HI> the hor&s;e under the command of the Captains <HI>Brattle, Prentice</HI> and <HI>Henchman,</HI> the la&s;t of which was commander in chief. The&s;e &s;everal com|panies modelled as afore&s;aid, were &s;ent out <HI>April</HI> 27th, 1676, to range the woods towards <HI>Ha&s;&s;aneme&s;it.</HI></P>
<P>THE 6th of <HI>May</HI> they met with a con&s;iderable party of the enemy; they were fir&s;t di&s;covered by the <HI>Na|tick</HI> &s;couts pur&s;uing a bear, and at the fir&s;t not di&s;cern|ing that the <HI>Natick</HI> Indian &s;couts belonged to our men, it gave &s;ome advantage to our forces; our hor&s;emen falling upon them before they were aware, killed and took of the enemy about 16, which they took no no|tice of at the pre&s;ent, altho' it was confe&s;&s;ed by them|&s;elves that they lo&s;t 20 in that encounter. It was re|ported that the &s;ounding of a trumpet without order did much hurt, but the commander in chief affirmeth that it was no di&s;advantage to the &s;ervice in hand, it
<PB N="155" REF="014120_0185_0F9302A09D43DA10">neither being heard by our own foot, nor yet by the ene|my. If any error was committed by the Engli&s;h com|panies, it was that the hor&s;e did not timely enough draw down from the top of the hill, whereby they came to be di&s;covered by the enemy, who thereupon made the more ha&s;te to e&s;cape; however, it was no &s;mall lo&s;s to the enemy, &s;ome of the &s;lain being known to be con&s;iderable per&s;ons; and it &s;truck &s;uch a terror in|to them that they never dur&s;t face our men afterwards; for although after our men returned to their quarters at <HI>Medfield,</HI> they &s;aw 200 fires in the night, yet they could never come near them again to fight any company of them; but the &s;ea&s;on proving rainy hindred any fur|ther pur&s;uit of them at that time. And &s;oon after this the &s;oldiers being vi&s;ited with &s;ickly di&s;tempers by rea|&s;on of an epidemical cold at that time prevailing thro' the country, they were for the pre&s;ent relea&s;ed for the recovery of their health, with intent to be called toge|ther again at a more convenient time; this was done the 10th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>DURING this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the enemy that were di&s;covered about <HI>Reho|both,</HI> bu&s;y in fi&s;hing in a river thereabouts, Captain <HI>Brattle</HI> was &s;ent up about the 23d of <HI>May,</HI> who with the help of &s;ome of the inhabitants, killed 11 or 12 of them, without the lo&s;s of but one of our men. Had they not di&s;covered &s;ome of our's on. the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, it was conceived a greater &s;poil might have been made among&s;t them.</P>
<P>BUT in the next place we mu&s;t take notice of the proceedings of the enemy about <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The greate&s;t body of them made towards <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony early in the &s;pring, as was &s;aid before, where we &s;hall leave them for the pre&s;ent, and ob&s;erve what the re|maining part of them did we&s;tward.</P>
<P>SOME &s;cattering parties were &s;kulking about <HI>Spring|field</HI> and tho&s;e lower towns, upon a &s;mall number of whom Capt. <HI>Holyoke</HI> (newly cho&s;en Captain of <HI>Spring|field</HI>

The other being &s;orely wounded was taken alive and brought home to <HI>Springfield,</HI> where he con|fe&s;&s;ed many things to one of the Inhabitants that un|der&s;tood their language, owning the truth in many things again&s;t his own company, and &s;oon after died of his wounds.</P>
<P>THIS was but a preparative to an higher piece of &s;er|vice which Capt. <HI>Holyoke</HI> was &s;oon after engaged in, and wherein he acquitted him&s;elf beyond expectation, and taking more pains than ordinary in making his re|treat, he got a &s;urfeit, which ended his days the <HI>Sep|tember</HI> following, near <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of <HI>April</HI> likewi&s;e, &s;ome of the inhabitants about <HI>Hadley,</HI> attending their tillage at <HI>Hockanum,</HI> within three miles of the town, and having a guard of &s;oldiers with them, yet three of the com|pany were ca&s;ually &s;lain by a party of the enemy that lay in wait for &s;uch an opportunity.

The &s;aid Capt. <HI>Ho|lycke</HI>'s hor&s;e was &s;hot down under him, and him&s;elf ready to be a&s;&s;aulted by many of the Indians, ju&s;t com|ing upon him, but di&s;charging his pi&s;tols upon one or two of them, whom he pre&s;ently di&s;patched, and a friend coming up to his re&s;cue, he was &s;aved, and &s;o carried off the &s;oldiers without any further lo&s;s. It is confidently reported by &s;ome that were there pre&s;ent at this engagement, that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the place; and another affirm|ed that he told near an hundred and forty &s;wimming down the falls, none of which were ob&s;erved to get alive to the &s;hore, &s;ave one. The lo&s;s that befel our men in the retreat was occa&s;ioned principally by the bodily weakne&s;s of Capt. <HI>Turner,</HI> unable to manage his charge any longer, yet &s;ome &s;ay they wanted powder, which forced them to retire as fa&s;t as they could by Capt. <HI>Turner</HI>'s order.

<P>THE enemy being amazed at the re&s;olution of our men, being but &s;o &s;mall a handful, that they fled im|mediately from the town; having lo&s;t twenty-five of their men in the enterprize.

<P>WHILE our forces continued thereabouts, they did the enemy &s;ome little &s;poil, in &s;eizing much of their fi&s;h, and goods &s;tolen from the Engli&s;h, and hid in their barns under ground; conjecturing al&s;o that they found four or five places where &s;ome of the Engli&s;h had been tortured to death by cruel burning, after they had been fa&s;tened between &s;takes &s;et in the ground; but not meeting with any of the enemy, they all re|turned home, conceiving that having been forced from their quarters in tho&s;e parts, they were drawn down lower towards the Engli&s;h plantations ea&s;tward, viz. <HI>Plimouth</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HI> What &s;ucce&s;s Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI>'s forces had in their retiring homeward, and what they ob&s;erved of the motion of the Indians, may be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">een in a letter of his dated <HI>June</HI> 30th: "Our &s;couts brought intelligence that all the Indians were to

<P>IT plainly appears by the contents of the &s;aid letter, as well as by many other te&s;timonies, that about this time the Indians, our enemies, who hitherto had been li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked together as brethren in iniquity and cruelty, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e now &s;trangely divided and &s;eparated the one from the other; &s;ome impute it to an a&s;&s;ault made upon

This was reported by an Indian brought to <HI>Seaconk, June</HI> 29, 1676, taken at <HI>Providence.</HI> Others are ready to think that it was up|on &s;ome quarrel among&s;t them&s;elves, occa&s;ioned by an evil &s;pirit &s;ent from God upon them, that thereby they might, being &s;cattered, the more ea&s;ily be taken and ruined by the Engli&s;h, now that the time of ven|geance was come, when they &s;hall be called to an ac|count for all their former outrages and cruelties; for now is the &s;nare ha&s;tening upon them wherein they &s;hall be hampered in their own devices, &s;o to be taken and de&s;troyed. It cannot but be acknowledged as a very remarkable providence, that Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> in his late expedition to <HI>Hadley,</HI> killed and took about 84 of the enemy, without the lo&s;s of any one of his own men; the like favorable &s;ucce&s;s happened to Major <HI>Tal|cot</HI> in his pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Norwich</HI> to <HI>Quabaog,</HI> as was &s;aid before, and &s;oon after his return.</P>
<P>BUT by that time our forces were returned home as far as <HI>Sudbury;</HI> they were ordered upon the &s;olicitation of the Governor of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> two companies of them at lea&s;t, to march away immediately to <HI>Dedham,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Seaconk</HI> or <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> to join Major <HI>Bradford</HI> in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Philip,</HI> who was it &s;eems with many hundreds of his barbarous followers fallen upon the Engli&s;h plantations thereabouts, and whither al&s;o a lit|tle before, Capt. <HI>Brattle</HI> with a troop of hor&s;e, and Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI> with a company of foot, were &s;ent up from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to pur&s;ue after them, now flocking in great numbers in tho&s;e woods. There was at this time no &s;mall hopes of &s;urprizing <HI>Philip;</HI> &s;everal reports being brought that he was &s;een in this and that place, not having above 20 or 30 men attending on him; but his time was not yet fully come, nor had he as yet ful|ly accompli&s;hed all that mi&s;chief he was like to be &s;uf|fered to do: For on the 1&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> 1676, a party of
<PB N="164" REF="014120_0194_0F9799FF5B62ECE0">his Indians committed a horrid and barbarous murder upon Mr. <HI>Hezekiab Willet,</HI> of <HI>Swanzey,</HI> an hopeful young gentleman as any in tho&s;e parts. They u&s;ed frequently to keep a &s;entinel on the top of their hou&s;e from a watch-hou&s;e built thereon, whence they could di&s;cover any Indians before they came near the hou&s;e, but not hearing of the enemy in tho&s;e parts for a con|&s;iderable time, that nece&s;&s;ary piece of circum&s;pection was omitted that day, whereby that de&s;erving per&s;on was betrayed into their cruel hands; for within a quar|ter of an hour after he went out of his own door, with|in fight of his hou&s;e, he was &s;hot at by three of them at once, from every one of whom he received a mortal wound; they after their barbarous manner took off his head, and carried it away with them (which however was &s;oon after recovered) leaving the trunk of his body behind, as a &s;ad monument of their inhuman cruelty. The &s;ame Indians, not being above 30 in number, took away a negro belonging to the &s;ame family, who being faithful to his ma&s;ter's and the country's intere&s;t, ven|tured his life to make his e&s;cape, which was the pre&s;er|vation of many others; for the &s;aid negro being a lit|tle acquainted with their language, di&s;covered to the Engli&s;h after his e&s;cape, <HI>Philip</HI>'s purpo&s;e to &s;eize &s;uch and &s;uch places: In the fir&s;t place to a&s;&s;ault <HI>Taunton,</HI> which in all probability had been in great danger, if their treacherous plots and purpo&s;es had not &s;o wonder|fully been made known beforehand. The &s;aid negro affirmed, that there was near a thou&s;and of them; for he ob&s;erved that altho' they had killed 20 head of neat cattle over night, yet there was not any part of them left the next day at eight o'clock in the morning. By this &s;pecial providence the enemy was defeated of their purpo&s;e, and never after had an opportunity of doing any con&s;iderable damage to the Engli&s;h in that part of the country. So, after this day, we may truely date the time of our deliverance, and beginning of revenges upon the enemy; now is their own turn come, when it &s;hall be done unto them as they have done unto us; they that before led others into captivity, mu&s;t hence|forth go into captivity them&s;elves; and they that kil|led

<P>OUR friends and brethren of that colony, although they had never actually felt half of tho&s;e mi&s;eries that befel the people of the other two, yet never denyed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the common enemy, yea, &s;ometimes they did afford it, before it was expre&s;|ly de&s;ired, according to the tenor of the articles of con|federation and rules of common prudence; con&s;idering that if the fire of this war was not timely extingui&s;hed it would endanger their own &s;abrick; therefore accord|ing to agreement, the council of that colony ordered their &s;ucce&s;sful commander, Major <HI>Talcot,</HI> to meet our forces at <HI>Quabaog,</HI> or <HI>Brookfield,</HI> in order to the pur&s;u|ing of the enemy in tho&s;e parts. In the way as they were marching from <HI>Norwich</HI> thither, divine Provi|dence &s;o far &s;miled upon the enterprize, as to give them an opportunity to &s;urprize 51 of the enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom 19 were &s;lain, without the lo&s;s of any one of their own company, which could not but much enhance the price of the victory to the conquerors.</P>
<P>THE like &s;ucce&s;s had their friends which they left behind (the volunteers gathered out of the three towns by the &s;ea-&s;ide, <HI>New-London, Stonington</HI> and <HI>Norwich</HI>) and who were &s;ome of them relea&s;ed by Major <HI>Talcot,</HI> when he fir&s;t began his march, that they might the better in the ab&s;ence of the army guard their own towns; for before the return of the forces under Maj. <HI>Talcot</HI> to that &s;ide of the country, they had made two expeditions again&s;t their enemies, the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets,</HI> that were &s;kulking up and down on that &s;ide of the country, in one of which they killed and took above

In the other 45, the mo&s;t of which probably were women and children, but being all young &s;erpents of the &s;ame brood, the &s;ubduing or ta|king &s;o many, ought to be acknowledged as another &s;ignal victory and pledge of divine favor to the En|gli&s;h.

IT was accounted by &s;ome that were pre&s;ent near the time of that a&s;&s;ault, a great over&s;ight, that having &s;o fair an opportunity to chace the enemy upon &s;o con|&s;iderable advantage, it was let &s;lip, and not improved, for <HI>Connecticut</HI> &s;oldiers being all, or mo&s;t of them fur|ni&s;hed with hor&s;es, they might have been &s;oon overta|ken, and many of them de&s;troyed, but God hid it from their eyes. The commander in chief, it is &s;aid, quartered at one end of the towns (<HI>Hatfield</HI> was then within the limits of <HI>Hadley</HI>) on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, and did not apprehend the advantage till the &s;ea&s;on was over; hor was any &s;uch thing as an a&s;&s;ault expected from the enemy &s;o early in the morning; it being a general ob&s;ervation heretofore, that they &s;eldom or e|ver u&s;ed to make any attempts in the night; part of which could not but be improved in way of preparation for &s;uch a de&s;ign.

<P>THE Governor and Council of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> take|ing into &s;erious con&s;ideration the many merciful oc|currences that had been returned upon us, notwith&s;tand|ing the mixing of many di&s;pen&s;ations of a contrary nature, thought them&s;elves bound to make &s;ome pub|lic acknowledgment thereof, to him who&s;e name alone is worthy to be prai&s;ed.

AND as this day appointed for &s;olemn and public thank&s;giving, was u&s;hered in by &s;everal &s;pecial mercies, &s;o al&s;o was it followed with many remarkable benefits. For be&s;ides the pre&s;erving the town of <HI>Northampton, March</HI> the 14th, and <HI>Hadley, June</HI> the 12th, by the timely &s;ending of our forces the very night before they were a&s;&s;aulted; the &s;aving the people of <HI>Marlborough</HI> from being cut off, was very ob&s;ervable; when Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> by occa&s;ionally going from the &s;ermon with the extremity of the tooth-ach, <HI>March</HI> 26th, di&s;co|vered the Indians ready to a&s;&s;ault the town, and the people might have been cut off, had not that accident happened. It is certain that after the end of this month, the power of the enemy began every where to fail; for the body of the enemy that had lurked about <HI>Connecticut</HI> river all this &s;pring, being vi&s;ited with &s;un|dry di&s;ea&s;es, di&s;appointed of their fi&s;hing, and put by their planting, began to be at variance among&s;t them|&s;elves; the <HI>Hadley</HI> and <HI>Pocumtuck</HI> (now <HI>Deerfield</HI>) In|dians quarreling with <HI>Philip</HI> for bringing all this mi&s;|chief about, and occa&s;ioning the Engli&s;h and them to fall out, with whom they had always good corre&s;|pondence, and lived lovingly together, but now they were like to be runied by the war. This quarrel pro|ceeded to that height, that from that time forward, tho&s;e &s;everal Indians that had for &s;o long time been combined together, re&s;olved now to part, and every one to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and return to their own homes; <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> and the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> to their own country again; the <HI>Nipnet</HI>'s and the ri|ver Indians bending their cour&s;e we&s;tward, others northward, towards <HI>Pennicock,</HI> upon <HI>Merrimack,</HI> intend|ing to &s;hift for them&s;elves as well as they could for the future; all which is like to be the real and true &s;tate of the ca&s;e with the Indians which were our enemies; for the next news we heard of <HI>Philip,</HI> was that he had returned back to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> now like to become <HI>Mount-Mi&s;ery</HI> unto him and his vagabond crew, and that his friends and allies that had hitherto &s;tood as neuters, waiting only which way the &s;cale of &s;ucce&s;s and victory would turn, began now to &s;ue for mercy
<PB N="169" REF="014120_0199_0F9302AFA1D842C8">at the hands of the Engli&s;h: The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> govern|ment having under&s;tood &s;omething of this nature, put forth a declaration, that what&s;oever Indians &s;hould within fourteen days next en&s;uing, come in to the En|gli&s;h, might hope for mercy. Among&s;t &s;undry that came in, there was one named <HI>James,</HI> the printer, the &s;upperadded title di&s;tingui&s;hing him from others of that name; who being a notorious apo&s;tate, that had learn|ed &s;o much of the Engli&s;h as not only to read and write, but had attained likewi&s;e &s;ome &s;kill in printing, and might have attained more (had he not like a fal&s;e villian ran away from his ma&s;ter before his time was out) he having &s;een and read the &s;aid declaration of the Engli&s;h, did venture him&s;elf upon the faith thereof, and came to &s;ue for his life; he affirmed, with others that came along with him, that more Indians had died &s;ince this war began, of di&s;ea&s;es (&s;uch as at other times they u&s;ed not to be acquainted with) than by the &s;word of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>NOT long after many of them came and offered them&s;elves, to the number of near two hundred, men, women, and children; and many more would have done the like, but their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt made them conclude that their cruelties and barbarous mur|ders could never be forgiven by the Engli&s;h. But what occurrences happened next &s;hall be declared in their order. About the end of <HI>June</HI> news was brought to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> with a &s;mall party of his men lurked about <HI>Swanzey</HI> or <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> and that he might ea&s;ily be taken; an Indian offering to bring them to the place where they might find him; whereupon &s;oldiers were in&s;tantly &s;ent away from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who &s;pent &s;ome time in &s;carching all the woods on that &s;ide of the country, but at la&s;t were forced to return, having mi&s;|&s;ed of what they aimed at. <HI>Plymouth</HI> colony likewi&s;e &s;ent out &s;oldiers upon the &s;ame account, under Major <HI>Bradford,</HI> who by the help of &s;ome Indians of <HI>Cape-God,</HI> always true to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, not only e&s;|caped an ambu&s;h laid for them, whereby mo&s;t of them
<PB N="170" REF="014120_0200_0F9302B06DB45140">might have been cut off, but &s;lew many of tho&s;e that laid in wait for them, without any lo&s;s to them&s;elves; yea further, a &s;quaw Sachem of <HI>Seaconet,</HI> one of <HI>Philip</HI>'s allies, having fir&s;t &s;ent three me&s;&s;engers to the Gover|nor of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to &s;ue for life and liberty, pro|mi&s;&s;ing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their government on that con|dition; but under&s;tanding that <HI>Plimouth</HI> forces were abroad, before her me&s;&s;engers returned, &s;he with her people, about ninety in number, rendered them&s;elves up to Major <HI>Bradford,</HI> &s;o that above one hundred and ten, on a moderate computation, were killed that day.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Connecticut</HI> forces had the like &s;ucce&s;s when &s;ent into <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country, under the command of the wonderfully &s;ucce&s;sful Major <HI>Talcot,</HI> Capt. <HI>George Deni&s;on,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Newbury,</HI> with other worthy com|manders of the &s;aid forces: For, on the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> 1676, as the &s;aid commanders with the forces under them were pur&s;uing the enemy in and about the <HI>Nar|rhagan&s;et</HI> country towards <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> hearing that <HI>Philip</HI> with his black regiment of <HI>Wampanoogs</HI> was thereabouts, their Indian &s;couts from the top of an hill di&s;covered a great number of the enemy that had new|ly pitched their &s;tation within the &s;emicircle of a &s;wamp. The Engli&s;h &s;oldiers were all mounted on hor&s;e-back, to the number of three hundred; where|fore the commanders ordered the Indians to be ready at the top of a hill, upon a &s;ignal given to run down ra|pidly upon the enemy, who were &s;ecurely lodged in the hallow of a &s;wamp ju&s;t oppo&s;ite them, while the hor&s;e|men being divided into two &s;quadrons, to ride round the hill, &s;o that at the &s;ame in&s;tant both the hor&s;emen upon the two wings, and the Indians a foot ru&s;hing down &s;uddenly upon the enemy, put them into a terri|ble fright, making a lamentable outcry, &s;ome getting into the &s;wamp, the re&s;t that were prevented by the hor&s;emen and the friendly Indians coming &s;o &s;uddenly upon them, were all taken pri&s;oners; Capt. <HI>Newbury</HI> with his troop alighting from their hor&s;es ran into the &s;wamp after them, where they killed at lea&s;t an hundred, as was judged by &s;ome then pre&s;ent, taking al&s;o many
<PB N="171" REF="014120_0201_0F9302B13689CEA8">pri&s;oners out of tho&s;e habitations of darkne&s;s, the ene|my &s;carce daring to make any re&s;i&s;tance; for none of the Engli&s;h, and but one or two of the <HI>Mohegins</HI> and <HI>Pequods</HI> were hurt in the a&s;&s;ault: yet it was affirmed by a captain pre&s;ent on the place, that with tho&s;e they killed and took at <HI>Warwick</HI> neck in their return home, (which were not above &s;ixty) that they killed and took of the enemy at that time above 300 young and old. At the &s;ame time was taken the old &s;quaw of <HI>Narrhagan&s;et,</HI> commonly called the old queen.</P>
<P>THEY were nece&s;&s;itated with this booty to return homewards to gratify the <HI>Mohegin</HI> and <HI>Pequod</HI> Indians that cccompanied them, who had done them very good &s;ervice in the pur&s;uit, having lo&s;t one or two of their men in the chace; but their return home was, as it proved in the i&s;&s;ue, more beneficial than their longer &s;tay might have been, to have made a fruitle&s;s pur&s;uit after <HI>Philip,</HI> (who&s;e time was not yet come, although ha&s;tening apace) for in their return they met 60 of the enemy, all of whom they &s;lew and took, &s;o as their &s;word returned not empty.</P>
<P>AMONG the pri&s;oners then taken was a &s;prightly young fellow, &s;eized by the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> who de&s;ired of the Engli&s;h commanders that he might be delivered in|to their hands, that they might put him to death in their <HI>own way,</HI> and &s;acrifice him to their cruel genius of revenge, in which bruiti&s;h and devili&s;h pa&s;&s;ion they mo&s;t of all delighted in. The Engli&s;h, tho' not delight|ed in blood, yet at this time were not unwilling to gratify their humour, le&s;t by a denial they might di&s;o|blige their Indian friends, of whom they lately made &s;o much u&s;e; partly al&s;o that they might have an oc|cular demon&s;tration of the &s;avage barbarous cruelty of the heathen. And indeed, of all the enemies that have been the &s;ubjects of the preceeding narrative, this vil|lain did mo&s;t de&s;erve to become an object of ju&s;tice and &s;everity; for he boldly told them that he had with his gun di&s;patched 19 Engli&s;h, and that he had charged it for the 20th, but not meeting with another, and un|willing
<PB N="172" REF="014120_0202_0F9302B1DC769348">to lo&s;e a fair &s;hot, he let fly at a <HI>Moghegin</HI> and killed him; with which having compleated his num|ber he was fully &s;atisfied. But, as is u&s;ually &s;aid, ju&s;|tice vindictive hath iron hands, though leaden feet; this cruel mon&s;ter is fallen into the hands of tho&s;e that will repay him &s;even fold. In the fir&s;t place therefore, making a great circle, they placed him in the middle that all their eyes might at the &s;ame time be plea&s;ed with utmo&s;t revenge upon him; they fir&s;t cut one of his fingers round in the joint, at the trunk of his hand with a &s;harp knife, and then broke it off, as was for|merly the cu&s;tom to do with a &s;laughtered bea&s;t before he is unca&s;ed; then they cut off another, and another after that, till they had finally di&s;membered one hand of all its digits, the blood &s;ometimes &s;pirting out in &s;treams a yard from his hand; which barbarous and unheard of cruelty the Engli&s;h were not able to bear, it forcing tears from their eyes; yet did not the unhappy victim ever relent, or &s;hew any &s;igns of an|gui&s;h; for, being a&s;ked by his tormentors how he liked the war? he replied, he liked it very well, and found it as &s;weet as Engli&s;hmen did their &s;ugar. In this frame he continued till his executioners had dealt with the toes of his feet as they had done with the fin|gers of his hands before; all the time making him dance round the circle, and &s;ing till he had wearied both him&s;elf and them At la&s;t they broke the bones of his legs, after which he was forced to &s;it down, which 'tis &s;aid he &s;ilently did, till they knocked out his brains.</P>
<P>WITHIN a few days after, 200 of the enemy with|in <HI>Plimouth</HI> juri&s;diction being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with famine and fear of danger, came and &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the government there; but three of the company were pre&s;ently detected of a cruel murder, and villainous a&s;|&s;ault upon one Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s hou&s;e of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> by a well-minded &s;quaw that was among them (hoping that po&s;&s;ibly &s;uch a di&s;covery would be plea&s;ing to the En|gli&s;h) and accordingly adjudged forthwith to undergo condign puni&s;hment, which the re&s;t that &s;urrendered them&s;elves, did not in the lea&s;t re&s;ent; &s;uch kind of
<PB N="173" REF="014120_0203_0F9302B2CD6F6848">villains being always exempted from acts of favor and mercy. Tho&s;e 200 that had newly &s;urrendered them|&s;elves, that they might give full proof of their fidelity, offered to lead a party of the Engli&s;h to a place not far off, where 20 more of the enemy might be &s;urpri|&s;ed, among&s;t whom al&s;o was one known to be a bloody murderer of an Engli&s;hman the year before; accord|ingly 8 Engli&s;hmen took 14 of the &s;aid Indians, and the next day brought in all the afore&s;aid 20 of the e|nemy, together with the &s;aid murderer, who was pre|&s;ently after executed, and the re&s;t taken into favor.</P>
<P>IT is affirmed al&s;o that five or &s;ix Sachems of <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> towards the ea&s;tern part of it, came with 300 Indi|ans to make peace with the Engli&s;h, on the 6th of <HI>Ju|ly,</HI> one of the &s;aid Sachems earne&s;tly de&s;iring the En|gli&s;h that none of them might be &s;uffered to &s;ell any &s;trong liquors to the Indians, the trading of which, po&s;&s;ibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath in a mea&s;ure contributed to the pre&s;ent mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>THE next day, <HI>July</HI> 7th, a &s;mall party of ours, with a few friendly or chri&s;tian Indians with them, killed and took &s;even of the enemy in the woods not far from <HI>Dedham,</HI> one of which was a <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> Sachem, who either him&s;elf informed, or by &s;ome other at that time certain intelligence was brought to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that &s;ome of our enemy Indians had got to <HI>Albany,</HI> informing peo|ple there, that they might the more ea&s;ily get powder and ammunition, that the Engli&s;h and they were now at peace. One of the &s;aid Indians was the Sachem of <HI>Springfield,</HI> a bloody and deceitful villian; it is hoped that he is now taken in the &s;nare from whence he &s;hall not be &s;uffered to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>PHILIP by this time could not but think his ruin was near at hand; yet that he might, in imitation of him that &s;tirred up all this mi&s;chief, expre&s;s the more wrath becau&s;e he knew his time was but &s;hort, inten|ded if po&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy one more town before his o|verthrow came; wherefore, on the 11th of <HI>July,</HI> with
<PB N="174" REF="014120_0204_0F9302B3600E6BC0">all the force he could get, or that he had left, he in|tended to &s;et upon <HI>Taunten,</HI> having as was conceived, many hundreds in his company; but his de&s;ign being &s;trangely di&s;covered by a negro whom they had taken captive a little before, that having lived near the In|dians before, under&s;tood much of their language, who making his e&s;cape from them, acquainted the inhabi|tants with the plot; who having timely notice, fur|ni&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;oldiers, whereby they were a|ble to repul&s;e the enemy upon his fir&s;t approach; &s;o as he only fired two hou&s;es, and then fled away: <HI>Ex|cept the Lord keepeth the city the watchman watcheth but in vain.</HI></P>
<P>THE 22d of this month of <HI>July,</HI> as is hinted before, the companies &s;ent from <HI>Concord May</HI> 30th, up towards <HI>Hadley,</HI> having &s;pent much time and pains in pur&s;uit of <HI>Philip</HI> all the country over (whom they could not yet overtake) having tired them&s;elves with many long and tedious marches through the de&s;ert woods, before they returned home, &s;ome of them were &s;ent toward <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> yet their labour was well improved, and follow|ed with good &s;ucce&s;s at the la&s;t: For in ranging tho&s;e woods in <HI>Plymouth</HI> colony, they killed and took (by the help of Capt. <HI>Mo&s;ely</HI>'s company, and Capt. <HI>Brat|tle</HI>'s troop joining with Major <HI>Bradford</HI>'s company of <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony) an hundred and fifty Indians, with|out the lo&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>IT was feared that <HI>Philip</HI> and his company would have returned into the <HI>Nipnet</HI> country, to prevent which; &s;everal hor&s;emen were &s;ent to guard the pa&s;&s;age; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ked about his own country in &s;wamps and other &s;ecret places, where he was as yet hid from the fight of the enemy, although many times they happened to lodge very near him, in&s;omuch as an Indian captive promi&s;ed in two hours time to bring our &s;oldiers to the very place where he was; but they not being able to pa&s;s the neare&s;t way, came a little too late; for they being &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, ha&s;ted away, leaving much of their trea&s;ure behind them; their kettles boiling over
<PB N="175" REF="014120_0205_0F9302B46BD91900">the fire, their dead unburried, and 20 of their party were overtaken, that fell into the Engli&s;h hands: <HI>Phi|lip</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;ome few of his &s;tragling followers making their e&s;cape by a raft over an arm of the &s;ea, into another neck of land on <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> &s;ide, not daring to tru&s;t him&s;elf any longer in <HI>Metapoi&s;et</HI> woods, &s;o full of our Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, as well tho&s;e of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> as of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> colony, who almo&s;t every day meet|ing with &s;ome of his party, much le&s;&s;ened his number. Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> that active and unwearied commander of <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, was at this time as well as long before, out upon the chace with but 18 Engli&s;h, and 22 Indians that were friends, had four &s;everal engage|ments with <HI>Philip</HI>'s party, wherein he &s;poiled 76 of the enemy, without the lo&s;s of one of his own men. In &s;everal of the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes tho&s;e Indians that upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion had their lives given them, have done no|table &s;ervice in hunting out the enemy in all their lurking places.</P>
<P>AT another time they took <HI>Philip</HI>'s &s;quaw, and one of his chief councellors; and about the &s;ame time ano|ther Sachem about <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> with 40 Indians &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the government of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> on promi&s;e of life and liberty. It &s;eemed that now the time of our deliverance was come, and the time al&s;o for the de|&s;truction of our enemies: For the la&s;t week in <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> under&s;tanding that &s;ome Indians were &s;een roving up and down the woods about <HI>Dedham,</HI> almo&s;t &s;tarved for want of victuals, &s;ent a &s;mall com|pany of 26, with about 9 or 10 chri&s;tian Indians, who pur&s;ued and took 50 of the enemy, without any lo&s;s to the Engli&s;h; at which time al&s;o a great quan|tity of wampampeag and powder were taken from the enemy. That which increa&s;ed this victory was the &s;laughter of <HI>Pomham,</HI> who was one of the &s;toute&s;t and mo&s;t valiant Sachems that belonged to the <HI>Narrha|gan&s;ets,</HI> who&s;e courage and &s;trength was &s;o great, that after he had been mortally wounded in the fight &s;o as he could not &s;tand, yet catching hold of an Engli&s;hman that by accident came near him, had done him an in|jury

<P>THESE &s;ucce&s;&s;es being daily &s;pread abroad among the Indians, put many of them into a trembling con|dition, not knowing well how to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves. Some that had been le&s;s active in the&s;e tragedies, and were rather led by others, than any wi&s;e inclined to mi&s;chief them&s;elves, ventured to &s;ubmit them&s;elves, of which number was one of <HI>Nipnet</HI> Sachems, called Sagamore <HI>John,</HI> who <HI>July</HI> 27th came to &s;urrender him&s;elf to the Governor and Council of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> bringing along with him 180 of the enemy Indians. This <HI>John,</HI> that he might the more ingratiate him&s;elf with the Engli&s;h, who&s;e friend&s;hip he was now willing to &s;eek after, did by a wile get into his hands one <HI>Matoonas,</HI> an old malicious villian, who was the fir&s;t that did any mi&s;chief within the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achn&s;ets</HI> colony, <HI>July</HI> 14th, 1675; bearing an old grudge again&s;t them as is thought, for ju&s;tice that was done upon one of his &s;ons 1671, who&s;e head ever &s;ince hangs upon a pole near the gibbet where he was hang|ed up: The bringing in of this malicious caitif was an hopeful pre&s;age that it would not be long before <HI>Philip</HI> him&s;elf, the grand villian, would in like man|ner receive a ju&s;t reward of his wickedne&s;s and murders.</P>
<P>SAGAMORE <HI>John,</HI> who came in the 27th of <HI>July,</HI> affirmed that he had never intended any mi&s;chief to the Engli&s;h at <HI>Brookfield</HI> the la&s;t year (near which vil|lage it &s;eems his place was) but that <HI>Philip</HI> coming over night among&s;t them, he was forced, for fear of his own life, to join with them again&s;t the Engli&s;h. <HI>Matoonas</HI> al&s;o when he was brought before the Council, and a&s;ked what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, confe&s;&s;ed that he had rightly de&s;erved death, and could expect no other, adding withal, that if he had followed their
<PB N="177" REF="014120_0207_0F9302B7EF4EC760">coun&s;el, he had not come to this; for he had &s;eemed to favor the praying Indians, and the chri&s;tian religion, but like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> by his practice afterwards di&s;|covered quickly that he had no part nor portion in that matter.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time &s;everal parties of Engli&s;h within <HI>Plimouth</HI> juri&s;diction, were willing to have a hand in &s;o good a matter as catching of <HI>Philip</HI> would be, who perceiving that he was now going down the wind, were willing to ha&s;ten his fall. Among&s;t others, a &s;mall party went out of <HI>Bridgewater, July</HI> 31&s;t, upon di&s;covery, and by providence were directed to fall upon a com|pany of Indians where <HI>Philip</HI> was; they came up with them, and killed &s;ome of his particular friends; <HI>Phi|lip</HI> him&s;elf was next to his uncle that was &s;hot down, and had the &s;oldier that had his choice which to &s;hoot at, known which had been the right bird, he might as well have taken him as his uncle; but tis &s;aid that he had not long cut off his hair that he might not be known: The party that did this exploit were few in number, and therefore not being able to keep together clo&s;e in the rear, that cunning fox e&s;caped away through bu&s;hes undi&s;cerned in the rear of the Engli&s;h: That which was mo&s;t remarkable in this de&s;ign, was that trembling fear appeared to be upon the Indians at this time, in&s;omuch that one of them having a gun in his hand, well loaded, yet was not able to fire it off, but &s;uffered an Engli&s;h &s;oldier to come clo&s;e up to his brea&s;t, and &s;o &s;hot him down, the other not being able to make any re&s;i&s;tance; nor were any of the Engli&s;h hurt at this time.</P>
<P>THE like terror was &s;een in others at that time, for within two days after Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> the terror of the Indians in <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, marching in pur&s;uit of <HI>Phi|lip,</HI> with about 30 Engli&s;hmen and 20 reconciled In|dians, took 23 of the enemy, and the next day follow|ing them by their tracks, fell upon their head quarters, and killed and took about 130 of them, lo&s;ing only one man. In this engagement God did appear in a more
<PB N="178" REF="014120_0208_0F9302B8D3BF5410">than ordinary manner to fight for the Engli&s;h, for the Indians by their number, and other advantages of the place, were &s;o conveniently provided, that they might have made the fir&s;t &s;hot at the Engli&s;h and done them much damage, but one of their own countrymen in Capt. <HI>Church</HI>'s company e&s;pying them, called aloud unto them in their own language, telling them that if they &s;hot a gun they were all dead men; with which they were &s;o amazed, that they dur&s;t not once offer to fire at the Engli&s;h, which made the victory the more remarkable. <HI>Philip</HI> made a very narrow e&s;cape at that time, being forced to leave his trea&s;ures, his beloved wife and only &s;on, to the mercy of the Engli&s;h. <HI>Skin for &s;kin, all that a man bath will be give for his life.</HI> His ruin being thus gradually carried on, his mi&s;ery was not prevented but augmented thereby; being him|&s;elf made acquainted with the &s;en&s;e and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children, lo&s;s of friends, &s;laughter of his &s;ubjects, bereavement of all family re|lations, and being &s;tripped of all outward comforts, be|fore his own life &s;hould be taken away. Such a &s;en|tence pa&s;&s;ed upon <HI>Gain,</HI> made him cry out, <HI>that his puni&s;hment was greater than be could bear.</HI> This bloody wretch hath one week more to live an object of pity, but a &s;pectacle of divine vengeance, his own fol|lowers beginning now to plot again&s;t his life, that they might make the better terms for their own; as they did al&s;o &s;eek to betray &s;quaw Sachem of <HI>Poca&s;&s;et, Phi|lip</HI>'s near kin&s;woman and confederate. For,</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6th, an Indian willing to &s;hift for him&s;elf, fled to <HI>Taunton,</HI> offering to lead any of the Engli&s;h that would follow him, to a party of Indians, which they might ea&s;ily apprehend, which 20 per&s;ons attempted, and accordingly &s;eized the whole company, 26 in num|ber, all but the &s;quaw Sachem her&s;elf, who intending to make an e&s;cape from the danger, attempted to get over the river, or arm of the &s;ea near by, upon a raft or &s;ome pieces of broken wood; but whether tired and &s;pent with &s;wimming, or &s;tarved with cold and hun|ger, &s;he was &s;tark naked in <HI>Metapoi&s;et,</HI> not far from the water &s;ide, which made &s;ome think that &s;he was
<PB N="179" REF="014120_0209_0F9302B96BB3E1A8">fir&s;t half-drowned, and &s;o ended her wretched life ju&s;t in that place where the year before &s;he had helped <HI>Philip</HI> to make his e&s;cape; her head being cut off and &s;et upon a pole in <HI>Taunton,</HI> was known by &s;ome Indi|ans then pri&s;oners, which &s;et them into an horrible lamentation; but &s;uch was the righteous hand of God in bringing at la&s;t that mi&s;chief upon them&s;elves, which they had without cau&s;e long acted again&s;t others.</P>
<P>PHILIP, like a &s;avage wild bea&s;t, having been hunted by the Engli&s;h forces thro' the woods above an hundred miles backward and forward, at la&s;t was dri|ven to his own den upon <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> where he reti|red with a few of his be&s;t friends into a &s;wamp, which proved but a pri&s;on to keep him fa&s;t till the me&s;&s;engers of death came by divine permi&s;&s;ion to execute ven|geance upon him, which was thus accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>SUCH had been his inveterate malice and wicked|ne&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h, that de&s;pairing of mercy from them, he could not bear that any thing &s;hould be &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him about a peace, in&s;omuch that he cau&s;ed one of his confederates to be killed for propounding an expedient of peace; which &s;o provoked &s;ome of his company, not altogether &s;o de&s;perate as him&s;elf, that one of them (a relation to him that was killed) fled to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> whither the brave Captain <HI>Church</HI> was newly retired to recruit his men for a little time, being much tired with hard marches all that week, inform|ing them that <HI>Philip</HI> was fled to a &s;wamp in <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> whither he would undertake to lead them that would pur&s;ue him. This was welcome news, and the be&s;t cordial for &s;uch martial &s;pirits; whereupon he immediately, with a &s;mall company of men, part En|gli&s;h and part Indians, beg in another march, which &s;hall prove fatal to <HI>Philip,</HI> and end that controver&s;y be-between the Engli&s;h and him: For coming very ear|ly to the &s;ide of the &s;wamp, his &s;oldiers began to &s;ur|round it, and (whether the devil appeared to him in a dream that night, as he did unto <HI>Saul,</HI> foreboding his tragical end, it matters not) as he was endeavoring to
<PB N="180" REF="014120_0210_0F9302BA19985670">make his e&s;cape out of the &s;wamp, he was &s;hot through the heart by an Indian of his own nation, as it is &s;aid, that had all this while pre&s;erved a neutrality untill this time, but now had the ca&s;ting vote in his power, by which he determined the quarrel that had been &s;o long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. In him is fulfilled what was &s;aid in the prophet, <HI>Wo to thee that &s;poile&s;t, and thou wa&s;t not &s;poiled, and deale&s;t treacherou&s;ly, and they dealt not trea|cherou&s;ly with thee; when thou &s;halt cea&s;e to &s;poil thou &s;halt he &s;poiled, and when thou &s;halt make an end to deal treacherou&s;ly, they &s;hall deal treacherou&s;ly with thee.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>Philip</HI> at this time fell five of his tru&s;tie&s;t followers, of whom one was &s;aid to be the &s;on of his chief captain, that had &s;hot the fir&s;t gun at the Engli&s;h the year before. This was done the 12th day of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> 1676, a remarkable te&s;timony of divine favor to the colony of <HI>Plimouh,</HI> who had for their former &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, appointed the 17th day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, to be kept as a day of &s;olemn thank&s;giving to Almighty God. There having been &s;o &s;trange a turn of provi|dence ob&s;erved in the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es obtained in and a|bout <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony, it may not be ami&s;s here to en|quire into the occa&s;ions that did lead thereunto, and al&s;o into the progre&s;s and continuance thereof, after the &s;laughter of <HI>Philip</HI> that grand REBEL.</P>
<P>IN the preceeding narration frequent mention hath been made of one Captain <HI>Church,</HI> whom God hath made an in&s;trument of &s;ignal victories over the Indians in that colony, and of great advantage in that re&s;pect to that whole juri&s;diction. It happened that the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Church</HI> &s;ome time in <HI>June,</HI> of this pre&s;ent year 1676, pa&s;&s;ing over in a canoe from <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> as he u&s;ed frequently to do, (having had much employment upon the &s;aid neck of land &s;o called) &s;eve|ral Indians whom he had known before at <HI>Lakenham,</HI> a village near <HI>Plimouth,</HI> beckoned to him, as if they had a mind to &s;peak with him; he having had &s;o much experience as well as others of their treachery, was not willing to adventure too ha&s;tily to come near
<PB N="181" REF="014120_0211_0F9302BC220D0A80">them; but when they &s;eemed to urge very much, and made &s;igns to him, and at la&s;t laid down their guns in his fight, he began to think with him&s;elf there might be &s;omething in the matter more than ordinary, there|fore he re&s;olved to go a little nearer to the &s;hore, and then he perceived they had a great mind to &s;peak with him, u&s;ing much importunity for that end, in&s;omuch that he ventured to go a-&s;hore among&s;t them, having but one Engli&s;hman and two Indians with him; he di|rected them to keep off the canoe while he di&s;cour&s;ed with the Indians on &s;hore. As &s;oon as he came among them, they told him they were weary of fighting, and that they had fought &s;o long by <HI>Philip</HI>'s in&s;tigation, but they could not tell for what end, and therefore were re&s;olved they would fight no longer, and all they de|&s;ired of him was, that he would make way for them to the Governor, that they might live quietly among&s;t the Engli&s;h as they had done before, and that they would deliver up their arms, or would go out with them if he plea&s;ed to accept of them, and fight for him; to that end they de&s;ired a time to parly with him further about that bu&s;ine&s;s, at what time and place he would appoint: He told them he would meet them two days after at <HI>Seaconet,</HI> a place up higher upon the &s;aid neck, about 12 o'clock; accordingly he came to the &s;aid place, and found the &s;ame Indians, with &s;ome others, and their Sunke Squaw, or chief woman of that plan|tation, there ready to meet him.</P>
<P>AFTER they had fallen into di&s;cour&s;e about the be|ginning of the war, as well as the &s;ucce&s;s and mi&s;chief of it, they would have put the blame off from them|&s;elves, and laid it upon the Engli&s;h: But he pre&s;ently convinced them by an undeniable evidence, that they fir&s;t began the war: For &s;aid he, upon this <HI>Poca&s;&s;et, July</HI> 7th, 1675, you fir&s;t fought with &s;ome of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> whereof one was my own &s;ervant, who&s;e leg you broke, and the &s;ame day you &s;hot at my&s;elf and company, before ever we meddled with you. They were &s;o fully convinced herewith, that they found no|thing
<PB N="182" REF="014120_0212_0F9302BC5BE47120">to reply, but fell into other di&s;cour&s;e about a peace, which they &s;eemed very de&s;irous to obtain upon any equal terms, as was &s;aid before. There were a|bout fifteen of the Indians pre&s;ent, be&s;ides their Sunke Squaw (which is with us their Governe&s;s or Lady) in conclu&s;ion they engaged forever after to leave <HI>Philip,</HI> and to go out with him; which they did forthwith, as &s;oon as he had obtained a peace for them with the Governor.</P>
<P>IT is here to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e were not pro|perly <HI>Philip</HI>'s Indians, but belonged to the <HI>Seaconet</HI> Squaw, who was nearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lated to <HI>Philip,</HI> and her &s;ub|jects had hitherto fought in <HI>Philip</HI>'s quarrel, till they &s;aw nothing but mi&s;ery and mi&s;chief like to be the i&s;|&s;ue of it to them&s;elves, as well as their neighbours. About 20 or 30 of the&s;e <HI>Seaconet</HI> Indians have con&s;tantly gone out with Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ever &s;ince, and not only been faithful and &s;erviceable to him, but very &s;ucce&s;s|ful in every enterprize they have gone about, nor hath he lo&s;t any of them in any &s;kirmi&s;h with the other In|dians: And it is &s;aid that this act of the&s;e Indians broke <HI>Philip</HI>'s heart as &s;oon as ever he under&s;tood it, &s;o as he never rejoiced after, or had any &s;ucce&s;s in any of his de&s;igns, but lo&s;t his men one time after another, till him&s;elf at la&s;t fell into the hands of tho&s;e under Capt. <HI>Church</HI>'s command: For at the &s;wamp when <HI>Philip</HI> was &s;lain, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> appointed an Engli&s;h|man and an Indian to &s;tand at &s;uch a place of the &s;wamp, where it happened <HI>Philip</HI> was breaking away; the morning being wet and rainy, the Engli&s;hman's gun would not fire; the Indian having an old mu&s;ket with a large touch-hole, it took fire the more readily, with which <HI>Philip</HI> was di&s;patched, the bullet pa&s;&s;ing directly through his heart, where <HI>Joab</HI> thru&s;t his darts into rebellious <HI>Ab&s;alom.</HI></P>
<P>THUS did divine vengeance retaliate on this noto|rious traitor, that had again&s;t his league and covenant ri&s;en up again&s;t the government of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to rai&s;e up again&s;t him one of his own people, or one that was in league with him, as he was with the Engli&s;h: The
<PB N="183" REF="014120_0213_0F9302BD47EF5B58">Indian that did this execution was called <HI>Alderman,</HI> of <HI>Seaconet,</HI> that had never done any act of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Engli&s;h. By the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages it is manife&s;t, that as <HI>the hearts of all are in the hard of God, &s;o he turns them as he plea&s;es,</HI> either to &s;avor his people, or to hate and deal &s;ubtilly with his &s;ervants, as &s;eems good to him. Since this engagement with the <HI>Seaconet</HI> Indians (to leave <HI>Philip,</HI> and to go with Capt. <HI>Church</HI>) it is cre|dibly affirmed, that &s;uch hath been their &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;ince <HI>June</HI> afore&s;aid, to the end of <HI>October</HI> follow|ing, there have been 700 Indians &s;ubdued, either by killing or taking captive, by means of Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his company, part Indians and part Engli&s;h, be|&s;ides 300 that have come in voluntarily to &s;ubmit them|&s;elves to the government of <HI>Plimouth.</HI> It appears thus by the &s;equel of things, that after the Lord hath ac|compli&s;hed his work upon his people, and he is be|ginning to call his enemies to an account, and puni&s;h them for the price of their hearts, and for all their treachery and cruelty again&s;t his &s;ervants. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Captains have run the &s;ame fate with him&s;elf, &s;ome before and &s;ome &s;ince his own fall.</P>
<P>IN <HI>June</HI> la&s;t one <HI>Tio&s;hq,</HI> a great Captain of his, his wife and child, or children being taken, though he e&s;caped him&s;elf at fir&s;t, yet came &s;ince and &s;urrendered him&s;elf. The next noted Captain of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Indians that was brought in after <HI>Philip</HI>'s death, was called <HI>Te&s;piquin,</HI> a notorious villain, next to <HI>Philip,</HI> he was called the black Sachem's &s;on: It was this <HI>Te&s;piquin</HI> that burnt &s;o many hou&s;es in <HI>Plimouth</HI> lately. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his company were in pur&s;uit of him in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, two days before they could get near him, at the la&s;t, on the third day, they found the track made by the &s;aid <HI>Te&s;piquin</HI>'s party, as they went to fetch ap|ples from the Engli&s;h orchards: This was &s;omething of a blind track, therefore they were forced to take up their quarters that night without di&s;covering any place of their rendezvous. The next morning about 9 o'clock they came to their fir&s;t rendezvous, from which they were ju&s;t gone: At 1 o'clock they came to the &s;econd,
<PB N="184" REF="014120_0214_0F9302BDEF4D3CD8">and mi&s;&s;ing them there, they &s;oon after came to the third track, wherein after they had marched a while, they perceived they grew very near them, by the cry|ing of a child which they heard: The place was near <HI>Lakenham,</HI> upon <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> neck, &s;o full of bu&s;hes that a man could not &s;ee a rod before him: Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ordered his men to march up together in one rank, becau&s;e he di&s;covered the Indians were laid in one range by &s;everal fires, &s;o that by that time they all came up into an even rank very near together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed, they all &s;uddenly ru&s;hed together in upon them, and catched hold of them, not &s;uffering any to e&s;cape, there being about fifty of them in all: <HI>Te&s;piquin</HI>'s wife and children were there, but he was ab&s;ent, as al&s;o one <HI>Jacob,</HI> and a girl that belonged to that company. The Captain's ha&s;te would not admit of his tarrying till they came in, (though the Indians &s;aid they might come that night) wherefore he thought upon this project, to leave two old Squaws upon the place, with victuals, and bid them tell <HI>Te&s;piquin</HI> that he &s;hould be his Captain over his Indians if he was found &s;o &s;tout a man as they re|ported him to be; for the Indians had &s;aid that <HI>Te&s;|piquin</HI> could not be pierced by a bullet, for &s;aid they, he was &s;hot twice, but the bullets glanced by him and could not hurt him. Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving this trap behind him to take the re&s;t: The next morning he came to &s;ee what his trap had catched, there he found <HI>Jacob</HI> afore&s;aid (a no|torious wretch) and the girl he mi&s;&s;ed before, but not <HI>Te&s;piquin:</HI> But within a day or two after the &s;aid <HI>Te&s;piquin,</HI> upon the hopes of being made a Captain under Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> came after &s;ome of the company, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf in the Captain's ab&s;ence, and was &s;ent to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> but upon trial (which was the condition on which his being promi&s;ed a Captain's commi&s;&s;ion under Capt. <HI>Church</HI> did depend) he was found penetrable by the Engli&s;h guns, for he fell down at the fir&s;t &s;hot, and thereby received the ju&s;t reward of his former wickedne&s;s. About a fortnight after the &s;urpri&s;ing of <HI>Te&s;piquin,</HI> was one <HI>Tote&s;on</HI>'s company ta|ken,
<PB N="185" REF="014120_0215_0F9302BEB9ACA218">wherein were above 50 per&s;ons; but <HI>Tote&s;on</HI> e&s;|caped, and is &s;till out in rebellion, unle&s;s vengeance hath overtaken him &s;ince.</P>
<P>THE next that was &s;eized was one <HI>Annawan,</HI> a very &s;ubtle, politic fellow, and one of <HI>Philip</HI>'s chief coun|&s;ellors; he had about twelve men, and as many wo|men and children in his company, who were di&s;covered by their &s;hooting at the Engli&s;h hor&s;es, and cattle; &s;ome of whom being taken, they made known the re&s;t. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> at that time had but five Engli&s;hmen, and twenty Indians. The place where this <HI>Annawan</HI> had betaken him&s;elf, was a ledge of rocks inacce&s;&s;ible but at one place, which by a few hands might ea&s;ily have been defended again&s;t a great number of a&s;&s;ailants: But Capt <HI>Church</HI> by direction got up to their wig|wams before they were aware of it; and pre&s;ently told <HI>Annawan</HI> that he came to &s;up with him that night; whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Annawan</HI> (who had fallen flat up|on the earth, expecting to have his head cut off) look|ed up and cried taubut, in their language, thank you, as one being much affected with the genero&s;ity of our Engli&s;h Captain; they found &s;ome of the Engli&s;h beef boiling in their kettles: After &s;upper he had much di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;aid <HI>Annawan,</HI> they lay down to &s;leep together in the wigwam; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> laying one of his legs upon <HI>Annawan,</HI> and the other upon his &s;on, that he might have notice if any of them offered to &s;tir: After midnight <HI>Annawan</HI> ro&s;e up, and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was pre&s;ently awake, and intended to watch after his pri&s;oner: He thought at fir&s;t he might have gone forth upon &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion; but not long after he returned again, having fetched out of a &s;wamp hard by, two horns of powder, and a large belt of peag, &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Philip</HI>'s belt, all which he de|livered to Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> in a way of thankful acknow|ledgement of his courte&s;y. Among&s;t other di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between them concerning the occa&s;ion of the war, and carrying of it on, the Indian would fain have ex|cu&s;ed <HI>Philip,</HI> and laid the blame upon the praying

<P>THE Indians being thus di&s;per&s;ed &s;everal ways, were &s;trangely confounded and de&s;troyed one parcel after a|nother, until there was none left in the we&s;tern or &s;outhern parts, that dur&s;t make any oppo&s;ition all the following part of the year. As for tho&s;e that fled we&s;tward toward <HI>Albany,</HI> we &s;hall there leave them for the pre&s;ent, wi&s;hing we may never hear any more of them: A per&s;on of quality informs, that at <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, he was pre&s;ent at the examination of one <HI>Choes,</HI> an Indian, formerly of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but one of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> fort the la&s;t winter, who confe&s;&s;ed that he was one of that company of Indians that went we&s;tward the month before, toward <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s river; but after the fight at <HI>Au&s;otunnoog,</HI> he &s;aid he returned back to <HI>Connecticut</HI> for fear of the <HI>Mohawks;</HI> and that he lay hid about <HI>Farmington,</HI> till he was almo&s;t &s;tarved; and then he went to the &s;ea-&s;ide to make u&s;e of the oy&s;ter-bank at <HI>Stratford</HI> for his relief, where he was e&s;pyed by the Indians, and &s;o brought to <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>HE affirmed that there were above 250 fighting men among&s;t tho&s;e Indians that fled we&s;tward, be&s;ides wo|men and children; and that near 200 of them pa&s;&s;ed the great river below <HI>Albany,</HI> and were &s;heltered by the Indians of that place, called <HI>Moheganders;</HI> but about 80 of them tarried on the hither &s;ide of that ri|ver, near a Dutch village. But he being convicted of fighting again&s;t the Engli&s;h, was condemned to die, and executed about the &s;ame time. Some few of the re&s;t were &s;kulking about the <HI>Narrhagan&s;et</HI> country the la&s;t fall, hoping to &s;helter them&s;elves under <HI>Uncas,</HI> but he not willing to give them countenance again&s;t the

<P>ABOUT the month of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, Mr. <HI>Stanton</HI> chanced to come from <HI>Seaconk</HI> with 3 Indians in his company, <HI>Pequods</HI> or <HI>Mohegins,</HI> they hearing by a captive at one of the next towns, that there was a num|ber of the enemy not far off, pre&s;ently left Mr. <HI>Stanton</HI> and pur&s;ued after them, whom they &s;oon after overtook, and made them all pri&s;oners: Among&s;t them was an old man, not able to go their pace, but promi&s;ing to come after them, they &s;pared his life: But as &s;oon as the men returned at night from hunting, the old man told them what had befel their women and children, whereupon the next morning they pre&s;ently following after them, overtook them, and &s;o recovered the pri|&s;oners, and &s;lew one of the three that carried them a|way; the other two hardly e&s;caped; one of them is called Major <HI>Symon,</HI> being part a <HI>Pequod</HI> and part a <HI>Narrhagan&s;et,</HI> but of extraordinary &s;trength and cou|rage; he perceiving the danger they were in, challenged to fight hand to hand with any five of them with their hatchets; but they unwilling to hang their &s;ucce&s;s up|on the hazard of a &s;ingle combat, came all towards him at once, whereupon fir&s;t di&s;charging his gun a|mong&s;t the whole company, he broke through them all by force, and &s;o e&s;caped their hands, with one of his companions. This <HI>Symon</HI> hath been very active in killing and taking many of the enemy; &s;ome &s;ay that he with his own hands hath taken and killed above three&s;core; and either out of hatred to the enemy, or love to the Engli&s;h, is this la&s;t week gone with the &s;oldiers to the ea&s;tward, in pur&s;uit of our quarrel a|gain&s;t them in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>AT another time not long before, when he was out again&s;t the enemy, he came &s;uddenly upon a great number of them as they were &s;pread under a &s;teep bank, from whence leaping down into the mid&s;t of
<PB N="190" REF="014120_0220_0F9302C351886B28">them, he killed &s;ome and took others. Fighting it &s;eems is a recreation to him, for he is &s;eldom at home above four or five days together. Some &s;ay that in one of his former expeditions, being much wearied and &s;pent he laid him&s;elf down to &s;leep, but towards morn|ing he fell into a dream, wherein he apprehended the Indians were upon him, when &s;uddenly ri&s;ing up he e&s;pyed the Indians coming toward him, but &s;uddenly pre&s;enting his guns again&s;t them, he &s;o frighted them, that they gave him an opportunity to make an e&s;cape from a multitude of them.</P>
<P>SINCE the beginning of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, news com|ing down to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> that mi&s;chief was done about <HI>Sea|conk</HI> and <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> by &s;ome remaining Indians therea|bouts, killing their &s;wine and hor&s;es, &s;everal per&s;ons of <HI>Medfield</HI> went out after them, and pur&s;uing them by their track, came upon a &s;mall party, of whom they took three, one of which e&s;caped while &s;ome of the company were going after the re&s;t. Tho&s;e that were taken confe&s;&s;ed there was about 60 that were lurking up and down in tho&s;e woods. The &s;aid two Indians were brought into <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> the 8th of <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>A commi&s;&s;ion was formerly granted to <HI>Peter Ephra|im,</HI> an Indian of <HI>Natick,</HI> to go out in pur&s;uit of them, with 29 of his company; a few of the Engli&s;h from <HI>Medfield</HI> went with him, who being &s;oon tired with marching in the &s;now, returned. The Indians kept on in their de&s;ign, and came acro&s;s a con&s;iderable party of the enemy, having traced them till they found where they lodged over night; they &s;urrounded them early in the morning, as their manner is, and then offered them quarter if they would yield; eight re&s;olute fel|lows refu&s;ed, who were in&s;tantly &s;hot, the re&s;t were all &s;eized. the whole number was 42. This was done a|bout the middle of <HI>January,</HI> &s;ince which &s;everal &s;uch exploits have been done by them. <HI>January</HI> 23d, the &s;ame company of Indians took 22 of the enemy, among whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere five able men, and five arms; they &s;ent the pri&s;oners home by five of their company, the re&s;t went further in the chace.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="014120_0221_0F9302C3E80CF9B8">
<HI>January</HI> 26th, another parcel of the enemy were brought in, eight in number, of whom five were men, among&s;t whom was the Indian called <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who three years &s;ince was indicted for killing an Engli&s;h|man's cow; upon which he is &s;aid to have uttered &s;e|veral threatning &s;peeches that he would kill Engli&s;h|men and their cows too; which was now remembered again&s;t him, when he was in particular called to ac|count for having a hand in killing &s;ome of the Engli&s;h and Indians al&s;o in league with us, for which he was &s;entenced to die, and was accordingly executed the 15th of <HI>February</HI> following.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the re&s;t of the Indians either in the colony of <HI>Plimouth, Connecticut,</HI> or the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> there is no occurrence more of moment come to light &s;ince the end of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, &s;ave what is la&s;t mention|ed before; yet it is very remarkable, that although terms of peace were offered to all that would come in and &s;urrender them&s;elves (as appears by a declaration put out in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t) and that a <HI>Nipnet</HI> Sachem called <HI>John,</HI> did thereupon with a number of his company come in and offer them&s;elves, and were accordingly &s;e|cured of their lives and other concernments; yet did that treacherous villain make an e&s;cape this winter from Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI>'s hou&s;e (under who&s;e charge he was put, about <HI>Cambridge</HI> village) and with above 20 more fled away into the woods to &s;hift for him&s;elf a|mong&s;t the re&s;t of his bloody companions; they were &s;oon after pur&s;ued, but had gone too fa&s;t and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo far to be overtaken. Whether it were con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own guilt, that having had a hand in the blood of the Engli&s;h they feared vengeance hung over their heads; or whether they liked not the Engli&s;h manners &s;o well as to be confined thereunto: Wild creatures ordinarily love the liberty of the woods better than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of a cage. They made none acquainted with their de&s;ign before they went away; and as yet little ac|count can be given of them, only it is known that one or two of their number have &s;ince been killed, and that one or two of their families are entertained by <HI>Un|cas,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="014120_0222_0F9302C49732FED0">but what is become of the re&s;t is uncertain; there were but &s;even of the company men, &s;o they are not capable of doing much mi&s;chief.

<P>AND becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent narrative there hath been frequent mention made of <HI>Uncas</HI> the <HI>Mohegin</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The tribe, though greatly dimini&s;hed, remains to this day.</NOTE>Sachem, and of his faithfulne&s;s to the intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h, I add in this place, that it is &s;u&s;pected by them that knew him be&s;t, that in his heart he is no better affected to the Engli&s;h or their religion, than the re&s;t of his countrymen, and that it hath been his own advantage that hath led him to be thus true to them who have upheld him as formerly again&s;t the <HI>Pequods,</HI> &s;o of late again&s;t the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets;</HI> yet hath he not long &s;ince been convinced of the truth of our religion, and vanity of his own, as him&s;elf hath &s;olemnly con|fe&s;&s;ed; which will evidently appear by the pa&s;&s;age that follows, which I &s;hall here repre&s;ent ju&s;t as it was from under the hand of that reverend per&s;on it relates unto, namely, Mr. <HI>Fitch,</HI> pa&s;tor of the church at <HI>Nor|wich,</HI> near unto which <HI>Uncas</HI>'s place is.

<P>"CONCERNING the drought, &amp;c. the true narra|tive of that providence is this.

<PB N="193" REF="014120_0223_0F9302C55937A870">came into town and did lament their want of rain, and that their powawes could get none in their way of wor|&s;hip, de&s;iring me that I would &s;eek to God for rain: I appointed a fa&s;t-day for that purpo&s;e; the day being come, it proved clear, without any clouds until &s;on &s;etting, when we came from the meeting, and then &s;ome clouds aro&s;e; the next day remained cloudy; then <HI>Uncas</HI> with many Indians came to my hou&s;e, <HI>Un|cas</HI> lamented there was &s;uch want of rain; I a&s;ked whether if God &s;hould &s;end us rain he would not attri|bute it to their powawes; he an&s;wered no, for they had done their uttermo&s;t and all in vain; I replied, if you will declare it before all the&s;e Indians, you &s;hall &s;ee what God will do for us; for although this year he hath &s;hewn his anger again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and not only again&s;t the Indians, yet he hath begun to &s;ave us, and I have found by experience twice in the like ca&s;e, when we &s;ought him by fa&s;ting and prayer, he hath given us rain, and never denyed us.

<P>BY all that is recorded in the foregoing narrative, there are none into who&s;e hands it &s;hall come, but will be &s;en&s;ible that the pre&s;ent time hath been a day of great rebuke and trouble to the poor people &s;ojourn|ing in this wilderne&s;s, upon whom &s;undry calamities have broke in at once this la&s;t, as well as in the form|er years: In many places they have been vi&s;ited with &s;ickne&s;s and mortality, more than in many years before, depriving them of many worthy and u&s;eful per&s;ons; among&s;t others the lo&s;s of Mr. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> the late worthy Governor of the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> is as it ought to be, much lamented by all, who died at <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> the 5th of <HI>April,</HI> 1676, in the 73d year of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,

Before an enterance be made into a relation of tho&s;e troubles that befel the ea&s;tern and north|ern parts of the &s;aid country from the Indians inhabit|ing tho&s;e parts, it will be requi&s;ite to give &s;ome ge|neral de&s;cription of the place, as being le&s;s frequented, and &s;o more unknown than the other, like <HI>Herald</HI>'s that u&s;ed to blazon the field before they meddle with the charge, as an hi&s;torian once &s;aid, that &s;o the rea|der may not mi&s;s the truth in a &s;tory, by being un|acquainted with the places connected with the di&s;cour&s;e. Briefly therefore, that more co&s;t and pains be not &s;pent in the &s;urveying a barren and rocky country, than will quit co&s;t (the li&s;t or border here being known to be worth more than the whole cloth) that whole track of land being of little worth, unle&s;s it were for the bor|ders thereof upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, and &s;ome &s;pots and &s;kirts of more de&s;irable land upon the banks of &s;ome rivers, how much &s;oever it be valued by them that know nothing thereof, but by the uncertain and fallible reports of &s;uch as have only &s;ailed by the country, or viewed &s;ome of the rivers and havens, but never pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="196" REF="014120_0226_0F9302C7ABD586F0">through the heart of the continent. The whole being &s;carce worth half tho&s;e mens lives that have been lo&s;t the&s;e two la&s;t years in hopes to &s;ave it.</P>
<P>THIS north part of <HI>New-England,</HI> did fir&s;t, like <HI>Zarah,</HI> put forth its hand, thereby inviting the ad|venturers to twi&s;t the &s;carlet thread of their hopes a|bout the &s;ame; by that au&s;picious beginning they were ready to promi&s;e them&s;elves great pro&s;perity in having that advantage before others to plant and people that part of the country. But that fair opportunity was al|mo&s;t quite lo&s;t by &s;ome fatal and mi&s;chievous accidents happening &s;oon after that noble enterprize was fir&s;t &s;et on foot, as hath been already in part, and may hereaf|ter be more fully declared.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t place that ever was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the En|gli&s;h, in hopes of making a plantation in tho&s;e parts, was a tract of land on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river <HI>Kenne|beck,</HI> then called <HI>Sagatawock,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Sagadahock</HI> O|ther places adjoining were &s;oon after &s;eized and im|proved for trading and fi&s;hing. The more remote and furthe&s;t northward at this time belonging to the En|gli&s;h (<HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> forty years &s;ince being &s;urprized by the <HI>French,</HI> and by them held to this day) is called <HI>Pemma|quid,</HI> di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues from <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> and is the utmo&s;t boundary of <HI>New-England,</HI> being about forty leagues di&s;tant from the mouth of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> ri|ver. <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> is a very commodious haven for &s;hips, and hath been found very advantageous to &s;uch as u&s;ed to come upon the&s;e coa&s;ts to make fi&s;hing voyages; &s;outh-we&s;t or &s;outh-ea&s;t from whence about &s;ix or &s;even leagues, lies an i&s;land called <HI>Monhiggon,</HI> of much u&s;e on the &s;ame account for fi&s;hing, it lying three or four leagues into the &s;ea from <HI>Damaril</HI>'s cove, a place of like advantage for the &s;tages of fi&s;hermen in former times. There have been for a long time &s;even or eight con&s;iderable dwellings about <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> which are well accomodated with pa&s;ture land about the haven for feeding cattle, and &s;ome fields al&s;o for tillage; all the land improvable for &s;uch u&s;es being already taken

<P>IN the mouth of the river <HI>Kennebeck</HI> lies a con&s;ider|able i&s;land called <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> &s;ome years &s;ince purcha|&s;ed by Major <HI>Clarke</HI> and Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> two merchants of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> on which they built &s;everal large dwellings, with a watch u&s;e and many other edifices near the wa|ter &s;ide, it being intended by the owners for a place of trading as well as planting; there being many of late &s;eated there &s;it to carry on each de&s;ign; where al|&s;o was built a fort, which if it had been carefully de|fended, might have proved the defence and &s;ecurity of all that &s;ide af the country, as it u&s;ed to be their ma|gazine. Up higher beyond the river <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> four leagues ea&s;tward tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> is another con&s;i|derable river called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">p&s;cot,</HI> upon the banks of which were many &s;cattered planters, who lately flying from their dwellings for fear of the Indians, left as was judg|ed, a thou&s;and head of neat cattle for the u&s;e of the Indians that made the late in&s;urrection again&s;t the in|habitants of tho&s;e parts, be&s;ides their fields and barns full of corn. There is another river that i&s;&s;ues into <HI>Kennebeck</HI> a little higher up into the country, called <HI>Pe|gyp&s;cot,</HI> that comes down from behind <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay.</HI> This <HI>Pegyp&s;cot</HI> is the &s;eat of the <HI>Amo&s;cogging</HI> Indians, who have had a great, if not a principal hand in the late mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>SOME few leagues to the &s;outh of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> lies the famous and &s;pacious haven called <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> the north ea&s;t cape of which is made by an i&s;land called <HI>Saguin;</HI> the &s;outhern or oppo&s;ite point of land is called <HI>Cape-Elizabeth.</HI> Within the bo&s;om of this bay, being about eight or nine leagues over at the mouth of it, are a great number of &s;mall i&s;lands, many of them being in|habited by fi&s;hermen and others; one of the principal of tho&s;e is called <HI>Jewels-I&s;land.</HI> There are many pla|ces about this bay &s;it to make commodious habitations, and on the &s;outh &s;ide of it is a &s;mall village called <HI>Falmouth;</HI> all, or mo&s;t of it lately de&s;troyed by the Indians.</P>

<P>THIS part of <HI>New-England</HI> began fir&s;t to be planted about the &s;ame time with <HI>Virginia,</HI> viz. in the year 1606. There the fir&s;t letters patent granted by the King, for the limitation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> did extend from
<PB N="200" REF="014120_0230_0F9302152B392B98"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and was divided in|to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and the &s;econd colony; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> appropriated to the city of <HI>London,</HI> the other to the cities of <HI>Bri&s;tol, Exeter,</HI> and town of <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> each of which had laws, privileges, and autho|rity for the government, and advancing their &s;everal plantations alike, as faith Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI> This &s;econd colony of <HI>New-England,</HI> promi&s;ing but little advantage to the undertakers, by rea&s;on of its mountainous and rocky &s;ituation, found but few adventurers forward to promote the planting thereof, after the death of Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that ever procured men or means to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; for when the main pillars are removed, what can be expected but that the whole building &s;hould fall to the ground. Yet notwith&s;tand|ing the di&s;couragements the fir&s;t planters met with in their fir&s;t winter &s;ea&s;oning, in that cold and rocky de|&s;art (which made them all return home in the year 1608) Sir <HI>Francis Popham,</HI> his &s;on, having the &s;hips and provi&s;ion which remained of the company, and &s;upplying what was nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e, &s;ent di|vers times to the coa&s;t for trade and fi&s;hing, of who&s;e lo&s;s or gain, as faith my author, him&s;elf was be&s;t able to give an account: And &s;ome of the &s;hips &s;ent by him, and the Earl of <HI>Southhampton,</HI> with other noble adventurers, did bring home &s;ome of the natives of the place in one of the following years, by who&s;e infor|mations &s;ome of the fir&s;t undertakers were encouraged once more to try the verity of their hopes, and &s;ee if po&s;&s;ibly they might find &s;omething that could induce a fre&s;h re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute &s;o pious and honorable a work.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean time before there was yet any &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ech or endeavour to &s;ettle any other plantation in tho&s;e parts, that about <HI>Sagadahock</HI> being thus aban|doned for the pre&s;ent, by the fir&s;t undertakers, the Frenchmen immediately took the opportunity to &s;ettle them&s;elves within our limits, which being under&s;tood by tho&s;e of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they di&s;creetly taking into their
<PB N="201" REF="014120_0231_0F930215DEBAA360">con&s;ideration the inconveniences that might ari&s;e by &s;uffering them to harbour there, Sir <HI>Samuel Argal</HI> was &s;ent with a commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;place them, which he with great di&s;cretion, dexterity, and judgment, performed about the year 1613, which made way for the planta|tion at <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> granted afterwards by King <HI>James</HI> to Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> one of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honorable council of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Argal</HI> &s;eized the forts which the Frenchmen had built at <HI>Mount Man&s;el, St. Croix</HI> and <HI>Port Real,</HI> and carried away their ordnance and provi&s;ions to the colony of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to their great benefit. The &s;aid places were held by the Engli&s;h many years after, till about the year 1635, by commi&s;&s;ion from the Scotch Lord afore&s;aid; but how his right came afterwards to be alienated to any of the French nation, doth not concern us with reference to the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, further to enquire.</P>
<P>THINGS remaining in this po&s;ture for the &s;pace of near &s;even years, &s;ome of the fir&s;t adventurers appre|hen&s;ive of better hopes of good that might en&s;ue by a fre&s;h attempt, re&s;olved to &s;et the de&s;ign a foot a &s;econd time, to which end &s;everal &s;hips were &s;ent on that ac|count in the year 1615, but with as bad &s;ucce&s;s as the former; for in the year before, viz 1614, Capt. <HI>Smith,</HI> de&s;irous to promote the colony of <HI>New-England,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Virginia,</HI> came thither with two ve&s;&s;els, and returned back to England in the lea&s;t of them. with intent to be there again that next year to promote the &s;aid plantation; but after he was gone, one <HI>Thomas Hunt,</HI> ma&s;ter of the &s;hip he left behind, like a di&s;hone&s;t man, to prevent the carrying on the plantation, that he and a few merchants might wholly enjoy the benefit of the trade of the country, after he had made his voyage, &s;eized upon 24 of the poor in|nocent natives, that in confidence of his hone&s;ty, had put them&s;elves into his hands, then clapping them un|der hatches, carried them away to <HI>Malego,</HI> whither he was bound with the fi&s;h he had made upon the coa&s;t, for that market; but this vile act, although it kept him for ever after from any more employment in tho&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="014120_0232_0F9302169985F750">parts, yet that was the lea&s;t part of the mi&s;chief that attended his wicked practice; for upon the arrival of the adventurers &s;hips the next year, two natives of the place that had been &s;ome years in England, and com|ing back unto the &s;aid &s;hips as &s;oon as they under&s;tood the injury &s;o treacherou&s;ly done to their countrymen, they contracted &s;uch a hatred again&s;t our whole nation, that although one of the &s;aid natives died &s;oon after, yet the other called <HI>Epenow,</HI> &s;tudied how to be reveng|ed, which he &s;o far found means to effect, that he fru&s;|trated this &s;econd attempt of &s;ettling a plantation in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>YET did not the adventurers ca&s;t off all hope of car|rying on their de&s;ign. wherein Providence within a few years after &s;o favored them, that one or more of the &s;avages, called <HI>Ti&s;quamtum</HI> and <HI>Samo&s;et,</HI> carried a|way by <HI>Hunt,</HI> was brought back to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> from whence he was &s;oon after conveyed by the prudent endeavor of Captain <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> (then Governor of the plantation began upon <HI>Newfoundland</HI>) into the hands of &s;ome of the adventurers, by who&s;e means they ho|ped to work a peace betwixt the &s;aid natives on that coa&s;t where the fire had been kindled before; for the adventurers employed Capt. <HI>Thomas Darmer,</HI> a prudent and indu&s;trious gentleman, to &s;ettle the affairs of the plantation, now a third time revived again about <HI>Ken|nebeck,</HI> about the year 1619. By his prudence and care a la&s;ting peace was made betwixt the natives of the place and the Engli&s;h, who were but a little before &s;o abhorred by them, for the wrong formerly received, &s;o as the plantation began at la&s;t to pro&s;per, and continue in good liking, and a&s;&s;urance of the friend&s;hip of their neighbours that had been lately &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t them. This <HI>Ti&s;quamtum</HI> beforementioned, was not a little in&s;trumental and helpful to the plantation begun at <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> about the following year, 1620, in their weak beginnings, there being frequent mention of his name, as al&s;o of one <HI>Same&s;et,</HI> a native of the &s;ame place, by the like providence brought back to <HI>Kenne|beck,</HI> and from thence with <HI>Ti&s;quamtum</HI> came to the
<PB N="203" REF="014120_0233_0F93021792B323D0">new planters at <HI>Patuxet,</HI> or <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and bro't them into acquaintance with <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> the great Sachem a|bout tho&s;e parts; without who&s;e friend&s;hip that new plantation would hardly have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tory premi&s;ed, is the more to be ob&s;erved in this place, becau&s;e the friend&s;hip upon the means and occa&s;ions afore&s;aid, confirmed between the Indians in the&s;e ea&s;tern parts and the Engli&s;h, had continued &s;tedfa&s;t and con&s;tant to this year, when it was broken by another treacherous and wicked practice of a like nature, and parrallel to that of the afore&s;aid <HI>Hunt,</HI> as may more fully be declared afterwards.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY the like &s;atisfaction may prove the more probable means to procure a &s;ettled peace. But to re|turn whence this digre&s;&s;ion hath been made. Some years were &s;pent to bring things to this i&s;&s;ue: The adventurers were put to much care and pains before they could get their patent confirmed and renewed again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Many ob&s;tructions they met with from &s;ome interlopers that began to look into the trade of this country, and would irregularly have had a &s;hare there|in, or made it common to all traders, to which end they petitioned to a parliament then called, to bring about their ends, but at the la&s;t it was &s;ettled firmly in the hands of &s;undry noble and worthy patentees, Lords, Knights, gentlemen, and merchants, commonly known by the name of the council of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> who had the ab&s;olute power under the King for making all grants, and di&s;po&s;ing of all lands from the 40th to the 48th degrees of north latitude; all which was accompli&s;hed about the year 1621. Some printed relations that &s;peak of the&s;e tran&s;actions, write much of the flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate, and hopeful pro&s;perity of this plantation, publi&s;hed about fifty years &s;ince, yet did it never ap|pear by what followed, that any con&s;iderable advan|tage did ever accrue to the fir&s;t undertakers, from this their new plantation of the ea&s;tern parts, unle&s;s by the trade of fi&s;h and furs, which latter continued not long; as for the former, the chief benefit redounded only to
<PB N="204" REF="014120_0234_0F9302181A1E89E8">them that managed it by their own particular &s;tocks, and per&s;onal endeavors; and if without offence it may be &s;poken, the multitude of patents &s;oon after granted to gentlemen of broken fortunes, have provided but places of an honorable exile or confinement, whither many de&s;erving per&s;ons of better education than for|tune, were &s;ent to &s;hift for them&s;elves in a foreign land, without being further trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e nearer home, on whom they had their hopes and dependance; yet it mu&s;t not be denied but that &s;ome of the underta|kers were at va&s;t expence, ca&s;ting their bread upon the&s;e waters, where none of their friends and relations have as yet had an opportunity to find it: The rea&s;on of which is not hard to give, in reference to all tho&s;e lands and territories that lie to the ea&s;tward of <HI>Pi&s;cata|qua</HI> river. One main cau&s;e hath been the multiplicity of grants and patents for the dividing of the &s;aid tract of land, for be&s;ides the &s;trife that hath been occa&s;ioned by the intricacy and indi&s;tinctne&s;s of their liberties and bounds, (enough to have maintained a greater num|ber of lawyers than ever were the inhabitants) if the grantees had been &s;upplied with monies proportionable to their &s;uits and controver&s;ies about their bounds and juri&s;dictions, which &s;ometimes they have been ready to de&s;ide with their &s;words, witne&s;s tho&s;e fatal names im|po&s;ed on &s;uch accounts upon &s;ome places belonging to tho&s;e parts, as <HI>Bloody-Point, Black-Point, Blue-Point,</HI> and every con&s;iderable parcel of land being by patent granted to &s;everal particular per&s;ons, hindred the erect|ing of town&s;hips and villages, which if it had been o|therwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, might have been full of towns, and well peopled, and thereby the inhabitants had been able to have &s;tood upon their guard, and defended them&s;elves again&s;t the common enemy, whereas now they were but like <HI>&s;copoe di&s;&s;olutoe,</HI> or like his arrows that being bound up in one bundle could not be broken by an ordinary force, but being loo&s;e, were ea&s;ily &s;napped a&s;under by any &s;ingle band. Another rea&s;on might be, the employing of &s;uch agents and in&s;tru|ments as either wanted &s;kill or fidelity to manage what they were in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ted with, which made many of the

<P>EVER &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettling of any Engli&s;h planta|tation in tho&s;e parts about <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> for the &s;pace of above fifty years, the Indians always carried it fair, and held good corre&s;pondence with the Engli&s;h, until the news came of <HI>Philip</HI>'s rebellion, and ri&s;ing again&s;t the inhabitants of <HI>Plimouth</HI> colony in the end of <HI>June,</HI> 1675; after which time it was apprehended by &s;uch as had the examination of the Indians about <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> that there was a general &s;urmi&s;e among&s;t them, that they &s;hould be required to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Philip,</HI> although they would not own that they were at all engaged in the quarrel.

But it is now time to begin with the particulars of the tra|gedy it&s;elf, that the reader account not the prologue too long. It was on the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> 1675, when the fir&s;t mi&s;chief was done by the Indians about <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> before twenty days were over, the fir&s;t fire be|gan to kindle in the&s;e more remote and northerly bounds of the &s;aid country, or two hundred and fifty miles di&s;tance, and upon this occa&s;ion, the 11th of <HI>Ju|ly,</HI> 1675, a letter was brought to <HI>Kennebeck</HI> from one <HI>Henry Sawyer,</HI> an inhabitant of <HI>York,</HI> &s;ignifying the news of the Indians ri&s;ing about <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and that a cour&s;e was taken to di&s;arm the Indians along the &s;hore. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umour did &s;o far awaken the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts, that the very next day, at a general meeting of the Engli&s;h, at one Capt. <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;hal</HI>'s hou&s;e, &s;everal offer|ed them&s;elves as volunteers to go up the &s;aid river of

The third day after, marching up the river to <HI>Quege&s;eck,</HI> they met with the inhabitants of <HI>Sheep&s;cut</HI> river, which is a river lying about twelve or fourteen miles to the north ea&s;t of <HI>Kennebeck.</HI> Divers of the Indians thereabouts, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of one Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> that u&s;ed to trade with them, brought down an incon&s;iderable part of their ammunition, as a few guns, a little powder and &s;hot, with a few knives. About 7 of the <HI>Kenne|beck</HI> Indians, and 5 of tho&s;e called <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> In|dians, about <HI>Pegyp&s;cot</HI> (a river more &s;outhward towards <HI>Ca&s;co</HI>) made this pretence of bringing in their arms. Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> Capt. <HI>Patti&s;hall,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Wi&s;wall,</HI> in who&s;e hands was &s;ettled a kind of military power for tho&s;e parts, were &s;ent for further to examine the &s;aid In|dians, of whom upon examination they &s;aw rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome, if not all, whereupon they &s;ent me&s;&s;en|gers a &s;econd time to the <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> Indians, and al&s;o a letter to Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> to &s;end down their arms and ammunition to them for their greater &s;ecurity. After Mr. <HI>Wi&s;wall</HI> was returned home, the 5 <HI>Amo&s;|coggan</HI> Indians afore&s;aid, brought in their guns, but probably with no good intent; for an Indian called <HI>Sowen,</HI> having an ax in his hand, &s;truck at one <HI>Ho&s;ea Mallet,</HI> a Frenchman, but was prevented from doing him mi&s;chief; however, the &s;aid Indian was pre&s;ently bound and put into a cellar. Some of the Engli&s;h that u&s;ed to trade with tho&s;e Indians were ready to excu&s;e the Indian, &s;aying he was drunk, or that he was a di&s;|tracted fellow, but Mr. <HI>Wi&s;wall,</HI> with the other two examinants, looked upon tho&s;e as mere excu&s;es, and altogether groundle&s;s, for one of them to this day af|firms that he was as rational and &s;en&s;ible as any of the re&s;t.</P>

<P>BUT the Indians left as ho&s;tages upon <HI>Sowen</HI>'s ac|count, however civilly they were treated, ran all away at the la&s;t, tru&s;ting more to the celerity of their own feet, than to the civility of their Engli&s;h friends, who after they were e&s;caped, joined with a parcel of their fellows &s;oon after, about twenty in all, in robbing the hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Purcha&s;e,</HI> an antient planter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Pegyp&s;cot</HI> river, and a known trader with the Indians, whatever wrong may be pretended by the &s;aid Indians, as done them in their trading (of which more may be &s;poken afterwards) that will in no wife excu&s;e their perfidious treachery and fal&s;ehood, in breaking cove|nant with the Engli&s;h, di&s;&s;embling and &s;eeking all ad|vantages of cruelty again&s;t their Engli&s;h neighbours, of which in the following winter and &s;ummer, 1676, there will be a more full and undeniable di&s;covery. This was done in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> 1675. Tho&s;e Indians that fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted Mr. <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI>'s hou&s;e, did no other mi&s;chief than pludering it of &s;trong liquor and ammunition, al&s;o killing a calf or two, with a few &s;heep, but no more than what they eat, and &s;poiling a

<P>IT is &s;aid that at the fir&s;t they u&s;ed fair words, and &s;poke of trading, but as they went away, told tho&s;e of the hou&s;e, that there were others coming after that would deal far wor&s;e with them, which within a &s;hort time after came to pa&s;s; for the&s;e were but the me&s;|&s;engers of death, which was &s;oon after inflicted, and that in a mo&s;t barbarous manner upon &s;undry inhabitants of the neighbouring plantations.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts being much incen&s;ed hereat, 25 of them &s;oon after going up <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> in a &s;loop and two boats to gather Indian corn, and to look to what they had upon the &s;aid <HI>Bay,</HI> near <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> river; when they came near the hou&s;es they heard a knocking, and a noi&s;e about the hou&s;es, and pre&s;ently e&s;pyed two or three Indians, who as yet did not &s;ee them. The Engli&s;h being come a good way from their ve&s;&s;el, endeavored to get between the Indians and the woods, which when they perceived, they ran to|ward the water &s;ide, but the Engli&s;h in pur&s;uit killed one of them and wounded another, who however e&s;ca|ped away in a canoe acro&s;s the river, a third running back toward the woods, fled to the other Indians, and acquainted them with what was done, who pre&s;ently came down and lay in wait to intercept the Engli&s;h, that thought of no danger, but &s;cattered them&s;elves all about the place to gather their corn, and lade the boats therewith, but before they were ready to go away, the Indians coming down, fired upon them, and forced

So with much ado, they all e&s;caped with their lives, leaving the two boats a mo&s;t laden with corn, a prey to the Indians, who pre&s;ently burnt one, and plundered the other of all that was therein; &s;ome are ready to think that the Engli&s;h did imprudently be|gin the quarrel, and not fir&s;t enquire into what the In|dians were about in the hou&s;e, and &s;eek redre&s;s accord|ing to the aformentioned agreement, made at the court in <HI>Kennebeck.</HI> But if this happened after what follows next to be related, viz. that which was done to old Mr. <HI>Wakely</HI> and his family, the Engli&s;h can be blamed for nothing but their negligence and &s;ecurity, in that hav|ing alarmed their enemies, they &s;tood not better upon their guard, which is not very certain; for tis thought that within a few days after, or the next week, a more horrible outrage was committed upon the family of an ancient man, who&s;e name was <HI>Wakely,</HI> an inhabitant of <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> who had &s;ome years before removed from <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Cape-Ann,</HI> out of &s;ome di&s;content, which afterwards he often bewailed, re&s;olving either to have returned back, or el&s;e to have removed to &s;ome &s;ecurer place, but he was arre&s;ted by the &s;ons of vio|lence before he could effect his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS old man, together with his wife, his &s;on, and his daughter in law, (then far advanced in pregnancy) with three grand-children, were cruelly murdered by tho&s;e barbarous &s;avages at one time; another of his grand-children was taken alive and led into captivity, a daughter of his was &s;aid to be carried to <HI>Narrhagan|&s;et,</HI> which &s;hews that they joined with the &s;outhern In|dians in the rebellion.

The Indians upon the &s;hot, think|ing he had been &s;lain thereby (as they heard afterwards) gave a great &s;hout, upon which they di&s;cerned that they were &s;urrounded by them, whereupon they in&s;tantly fired on the enemy from all quarters, and from the flankers of the fortification, &s;o as they wounded the Captain of the Indians, who pre&s;ently leaving the a&s;|&s;ault, retired three or four miles from the place, where he &s;oon after died, as they were informed: He coun|&s;elled them to leave the &s;iege, but they were re&s;olved not &s;o to quit the place; nor were tho&s;e within le&s;s re&s;olute to defend it: One of the be&s;t men was &s;oon after di&s;abled from any further &s;ervice, by a wound he received in one of the vollies made upon them by the a&s;&s;ailants; but that did not in the lea&s;t daunt the re&s;t of the defendants, who continued &s;till to fire upon the enemy: This di&s;pute la&s;ted about an hour, after which the enemy de&s;pairing to take the hou&s;e by a&s;&s;ault, tho't upon a device how to burn it.</P>
<P>FIRST, firing the hou&s;e of one of his tenants, then his &s;aw-mill, after that his corn-mill, hoping by that means to draw them out of the garri&s;on to put out the fire, but mi&s;&s;ing of their purpo&s;e in that, they called out, you Engli&s;h cowardly dogs, come out and quench the fire. They continued this &s;port all the afternoon, continually almo&s;t without any intermi&s;&s;ion firing upon them. The be&s;ieged hoped for relief from the town,
<PB N="217" REF="014120_0247_0F9302259B651B78">but none came, the Major &s;till encouraging his men to hold it out, which they manfully did all that night, when they were alarmed almo&s;t every half hour; and between whiles they could hear their axes and other in&s;truments, knocking about the mills till the next day. Tho&s;e within the hou&s;e conceived they were preparing &s;ome engine wherewith to burn the hou&s;e, which really was the ca&s;e, for about four or five o'clock in the morn|ing, at the &s;itting of the moon, the Major was called by his men to look out, when he &s;aw a cart with four wheels, having a barricado built in the fore part to keep off &s;hot, and filled with combu&s;tible matter, birch rinds, &s;traw, powder, andpoles 20 foot long, ready to fire the hou&s;e; he bid them let them drive it within pi&s;tol &s;hot, before they made any &s;hot again&s;t them; his men were a little di&s;couraged at the fight of this engine; but he bid them be of good courage, and u&s;e means putting their tru&s;t in God, who, he was confi|dent would relieve them. The cart when brought a little nearer, became unweildy by rea&s;on of the barri|cado planted in it, and being to pa&s;s through a &s;mall gutter, one wheel &s;tuck fa&s;t in the &s;lough, which bro't the cart &s;uddenly to the left, whereby the drivers lay all open to their right flanker, when they fired upon them out of the &s;aid flanker, and having &s;o fair a &s;hot upon them, and not being above pi&s;tol &s;hot from the place, they killed 6 of the enemy, and wounded 15, as they found afterwards, which no doubt made them too late to repent of their re&s;olution, not to follow their Captains coun&s;el and example in leaving the &s;iege; for now they pre&s;ently departed; &s;o as at &s;un-ri&s;e, tho&s;e within the hou&s;e e&s;pyed 40 of them marching away, but how many more were in the company they could not tell.</P>
<P>THE Indians it &s;eems went towards <HI>Blue Point,</HI> where it is &s;aid they killed &s;everal per&s;ons; but the&s;e in the hou&s;e feared they went for more help, and ex|pected their return; but it &s;eems their courage failed them as to another attempt upon an hou&s;e &s;o well

About a fortnight after, the Indians hearing thereof, came and burnt down the empty hou&s;e. There were 50 per&s;ons in the &s;aid hou&s;e during the time of the &s;iege, and but 10 able hands; they had 5 more that could do &s;ome|thing, but through age or minority, not able to make any great re&s;i&s;tance; yet it plea&s;ed God, in who&s;e hands are all mens lives and limbs, who is never wont to fail them, who in time of danger are ready to con|fide in his power and goodne&s;s, as not to neglect the u&s;e of due means for their own pre&s;ervation, &s;o to or|der things, that not one per&s;on of all tho&s;e 50 was ei|ther killed or mortally wounded. Major <HI>Phillips</HI> him|&s;elf was wounded, but not dangerou&s;ly, at the begin|ning of the a&s;&s;ault, his mills with other edifices were the fir&s;t day burnt by the enemy, and &s;o were all the hou&s;es at <HI>Saco,</HI> or mo&s;t of them &s;oon after, that were above the fi&s;hermens &s;tages.

<P>MUCH about the &s;ame time, five per&s;ons going up the river of <HI>Saco,</HI> were all killed by the &s;ame Indians.</P>
<P>THESE tragedies being thus acted at <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> and <HI>Saco,</HI> tho&s;e barbarous enemies di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in parties, intending to do all the mi&s;chief they could to the Engli&s;h inhabiting about that &s;ide of the country. In the &s;ame month of <HI>September</HI> they came down to|wards <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> doing the like &s;poil upon the inha|bitants of the &s;everal branches of that river, which they had been doing el&s;ewhere. In the fir&s;t place they burnt the two <HI>Cheflyes</HI> hou&s;es about oy&s;ter river, and killed
<PB N="219" REF="014120_0249_0F93022719B52188">two men that were pa&s;&s;ing along the river in a canoe, and carried away an old Iri&s;hman, with a young man taken from about <HI>Exeter,</HI> who both of them &s;oon after made an e&s;cape to a garri&s;on at &s;almon falls in <HI>Kittery,</HI> by the help of an Indian better di&s;po&s;ed than the re&s;t, the fir&s;t after &s;even weeks, the other after a month's captivity.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time one <HI>Goodman Robin&s;on,</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> with his &s;on, were travelling towards <HI>Hamp|ton,</HI> where, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, they were way laid by three Indians, viz. <HI>John Samp&s;on, Cromwel,</HI> and <HI>John Linde,</HI> who &s;hot the old man, and left him dead upon the place; his &s;on, hearing the guns, e&s;caped their hands by running into a &s;wamp, whither the In|dians pur&s;ued him, but could not overtake him, &s;o he got &s;afe into <HI>Hampton</HI> about midnight, where he rela|ted what had be&s;el him by the way, and how narrowly he avoided the danger, intimating likewi&s;e, that he feared his father was killed, which was found too true, by Lieut. <HI>Saver,</HI> who the next day with 12 &s;oldiers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e town went to &s;earch tho&s;e woods, where they found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e poor old man &s;hot through his back, the bullet hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through his body, and was &s;topped by the &s;kin on the other &s;ide. Another per&s;on of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Foul&s;am,</HI> was at the &s;ame time driv|ing a pair of oxen in the &s;ame road, where, &s;oon after he heard the report of the guns when <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> was killed, he e&s;pyed the three Indians creeping upon their bellies towards him, to do as much for him as they had done for <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> but leaving his oxen, he put on his hou&s;e with all &s;peed, and &s;o was delivered from the danger that the other fell into; it is reported that one of the Indians made a &s;hot at him; but he was either got out of their reach, or el&s;e they mi&s;&s;ed their aim at that time. The &s;ame Indians had a little before mer with another Engli&s;hman in tho&s;e woods, one <HI>Charles Randlet,</HI> whom they carried captive, although he &s;oon after e&s;caped out of their hands, by the help of ano|ther Indian called <HI>James.</HI> It is &s;aid there were four Indians of that company, and that the fourth was &s;ent

<P>WITHIN a few days after that barbarous fact at <HI>Oy&s;ter</HI> river, two Indians, viz. one named <HI>Andrew,</HI> and the other <HI>Hopehood,</HI> the &s;on of him called <HI>Robin|hood,</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of one <HI>Tozer</HI> at <HI>Neweche|wannick,</HI> wherein were fifteen per&s;ons, yet all women and children, who without all doubt had all of them fallen into the mercile&s;s hands of the too cruel and barbarous caitiffs, had not a young maid of about 18 years of age, fir&s;t e&s;pyed them, who being endued with more courage than ordinarilly the re&s;t of the &s;ex u&s;e to be (the ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Jael</HI> light upon her) fir&s;t &s;hut too the door, whereby they were denied enterance till the re&s;t within e&s;caped to the next hou&s;e, that was better fortified; that young heroe&s;s kept the door fa&s;t again&s;t them &s;o long, till the Indians had chopped it in pieces with their hatchets, when entering the hou&s;e, they knocked the poor maid down with their hatchets, and gave her many other wounds, leaving her for dead up|on the place; after which they pa&s;&s;ed on toward the next dwelling, in their way meeting with two children that had e&s;caped the hou&s;e fir&s;t broken open by them, they killed one of them, of three years old, which could not follow fa&s;t enough, or el&s;e they that carried it could not convey it over a fence &s;oon enough to &s;ave them&s;elves and it; and carried away the other of &s;even years old, which however was returned &s;afe within half a year after. The poor maid that had ventured her u&s;e &s;o far to &s;ave many others, was by a &s;trange Provi|dence
<PB N="221" REF="014120_0251_0F93022B2FA02B50">enabled to recover &s;o much &s;trengh after they were gone, as to repair to the next garri&s;on, where &s;he was &s;oon after healed of her wounds, and re&s;tored to perfect health again.</P>
<P>THE next day toward night more of the barbarous enemies being gathered together, they made an a&s;&s;ault upon the neighbouring dwellings. The Engli&s;h as many as could be &s;pared out of the garri&s;on (not above 8 in number) pur&s;ued after them about half a mile, but night coming on, it was judged be&s;t to retreat, le&s;t otherwi&s;e they might have been intercepted in their re|turn home, by any of them lying in ambu&s;h, which is their u&s;ual way of doing mi&s;chief. After divers &s;hot made on both &s;ides, but 5 of the enemy appeared; who yet took the advantage of Capt. <HI>Wincol</HI>'s ab&s;ence, (who&s;e dwelling was not far off) to burn his hou&s;e and barn, with another hou&s;e and two barns more, where|in was much Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn, &s;uppo&s;ed to be above an hundred bu&s;hels in one of them. After they had done this mi&s;chief they fled away. The next day after, the &s;ame Indians, or others of their fellows, came upon the other &s;ide of the river, from whence they &s;hot over &s;everal times, to &s;ome that were grinding in the mill, but after the exchanging of many &s;hot on both &s;ides the river betwixt them, 6 of the enemy &s;hewed them&s;elves in the twilight, uttering &s;everal in&s;olent and barbarous &s;peeches, calling our men Engli&s;h dogs, &amp;c. yet all this while out of reach of their &s;hot, and then they ran all away like dogs after they had done barking.</P>
<P>AFTER this tho&s;e very Indians, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, burned 5 or 6 hou&s;es about <HI>Oy&s;ter</HI> river, and killed two men, viz one <HI>William Roberts,</HI> and his &s;on in law. The inhabitants of <HI>Dover,</HI> with &s;ome other re&s;olute young men, being much provoked by the&s;e many in|&s;olencies and injuries done by the enemy, obtained liberty from the Major of the regiment, to try whe|ther they could not meet with &s;ome of the Indians, by &s;ecret amputhes, and &s;kulking among&s;t the bu&s;hes and
<PB N="222" REF="014120_0252_0F93022B9CDF5B80">trees, as the Indians u&s;ed to do with them; to which end about twenty divided them&s;elves into &s;everal &s;mall parties: Soon after as they were looking for the ene|my, a party of ours e&s;pied 5 of the Indians, &s;ome ga|thering corn in the field, while the re&s;t of them were bu&s;ied in heating of an oven to bake &s;ome of the fruit which they al&s;o gathered in the &s;ame field. The En|gli&s;h were at &s;uch a di&s;tance that they could not make any &s;ign to their comrades, without being di&s;covered by the Indians in the field; wherefore two of them crept as near as they could to the hou&s;e, at one end of the field, where they &s;uddenly ru&s;hed upon two of the wretches, and knocked them down with the butt end of their mu&s;kets, which was not done &s;o &s;ilently, but the other three in the field took the alarm and fled away, who might el&s;e as ea&s;ily as the other two have been &s;urprized.</P>
<P>THESE outrages thus daily committed, filled all the plantations about <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> with fear and confu&s;ion; &s;carce any place where there was not rea&s;on for &s;ome to complain either of the lo&s;s of their friends, or burn|ing of their hou&s;es; which cau&s;ed mo&s;t of them that lived &s;catteringly, at any di&s;tance from neighbours, either to garri&s;on their hou&s;es, or el&s;e to de&s;ert their own dwellings, and to repair to their next neighbours that were better fortified than them&s;elves; but all the inhabitants in tho&s;e parts in general were alarmed to &s;tand upon their guard.</P>
<P>ON the 7th of <HI>October</HI> following, being a day of public humiliation, a man was &s;hot down as he was riding between two garri&s;on hou&s;es about <HI>Neweche|wannick,</HI> and died of his wounds two months after; about the &s;ame in&s;tant of time two young men were &s;hot dead about a mile from that place; the&s;e two had their arms or guns with them, which were carried away by tho&s;e who killed them, together with their upper garments: It it not &s;aid that the&s;e three la&s;t (though killed upon a day of humifiation) were &s;ur|prized in their repairing to, or returning from the
<PB N="223" REF="014120_0253_0F93022C73C255F0">place of public wor&s;hip, which would in a great mea|&s;ure have abated the &s;orrow of their &s;ad funerals, if when they were &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by the harbingers of death, they had been found &s;o doing. Soon after this they a&s;&s;aulted another hou&s;e at <HI>Oy&s;ter</HI> river, notwith|&s;tanding it was garri&s;oned, and meeting with a good old man, who&s;e name was <HI>Beard,</HI> without the garri&s;on, they killed him upon the place, and in a barbarous manner cut off his head, and &s;et it upon a pole in de|ri&s;ion. Not far off about the &s;ame time they burnt a|nother hou&s;e and barn.</P>
<P>UPON the 16th of <HI>October,</HI> being <HI>Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ay,</HI> about an 100 of the Indians were gathered together to a&s;&s;ault <HI>Newechewannick;</HI> they began with one named <HI>Tozer,</HI> half a mile from the upper garri&s;on, at <HI>Salmon Falls:</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Tizer</HI> was pre&s;ently killed, his &s;on taken captive (but returned after &s;ome months re&s;traint) &s;e|veral guns being &s;hot at this a&s;&s;ault, alarmed Lieut. <HI>Plai&s;ted,</HI> at the next garri&s;on, who like a man of a public &s;pirit, immediately &s;ent out 7 men from the gar|ri&s;on under his command, to &s;ee what the matter was, but being met by an ambu&s;h laid in the way as they went, lo&s;t 2 or 3 of their company, the re&s;t hardly e&s;caping back to the place from whence they came; where|upon the &s;aid Lieut. <HI>Plai&s;ted</HI> immediately di&s;patched away a me&s;&s;enger to Major <HI>Waldern,</HI> at <HI>Quechecho,</HI> which becau&s;e it &s;eems to be the la&s;t time that ever that good and u&s;eful man &s;et pen to paper, the letter &s;hall be here in&s;erted.</P>

<P>WHAT an&s;wer was returned to this importunate and pathetical letter is not fully known at pre&s;ent; mo&s;t probably he that was mo&s;t concerned in the contents of it was either ab&s;ent from home, or in no capacity to &s;end the relief de&s;ired, which if it could have been had, might have prevented the &s;ad mi&s;chief that fell out the next day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> when Lieut. <HI>Plai&s;ted</HI> being more earne&s;tly bent to perform that la&s;t office of love to his decea&s;ed friends, whom he could not by all his endcavours &s;ave from the danger of death, while they were in the land of the living, would needs venture him&s;elf with 20 &s;ol|diers out of his garri&s;on, to fetch off the dead bodies.</P>
<P>TO that end he ordered a pair of oxen to be yoked to bring them to his garri&s;on, in order to their chri&s;ti|an burial, not con&s;idering that the Indians lay &s;kulking thereabouts, waiting for &s;uch opportunities. They went fir&s;t to the furthe&s;t place, where they found <HI>R.

<PB N="225" REF="014120_0255_0F93022DDF0F3F88">and &s;o got &s;afe to their garri&s;on, while Lieut. <HI>Plai&s;ted</HI> out of the height of his courage, di&s;daining either to fly from, or yield him&s;elf (for 'tis &s;aid the Indians were loth to kill him, but de&s;irous rather to take him pri|&s;oner) into the hands of &s;uch cur&s;ed caitiffs, did fight it out de&s;perately, till he was &s;lain upon the place; his elde&s;t &s;on and another man were &s;lain in their too late retreat, and his other &s;on was &s;orely wounded, &s;o that he died within a few weeks after.</P>
<P>THE Indians were contented with this mi&s;chief for the pre&s;ent, and &s;lunk away into the woods before the next day, when Captain <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> came up from <HI>Sturgeon Creek,</HI> a few miles below the river, with a party of his friends, and buried the dead. During the&s;e on&s;ets the enemy al&s;o took the advantage to burn three hou&s;es and two barns before they left the place.</P>
<P>THE latter end of the &s;ame month they burnt a mill near the &s;ame place belonging to Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> a merchant of <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> from whence they came down to|ward <HI>Sturgeon Creek,</HI> where they burnt one hou&s;e and killed two men not far from Captain <HI>Fro&s;t</HI>'s dwelling, he e&s;caping him&s;elf very narrowly, being &s;hot at by the enemy, about ten in number, who might ea&s;ily have burnt his hou&s;e and taken all that was in it, be|ing but three boys be&s;ides him&s;elf, had he not u&s;ed this policy, to call out to &s;ome to march this, and the other way, to look after the Indians, as if he had had many at hand to command, which under God was the means of his e&s;cape; for his hou&s;e was neither fortified, nor well manned, although far from neighbors.</P>
<P>THE next day the &s;aid Indians pa&s;&s;ed down the ri|ver on <HI>Kittery</HI> &s;ide, killed one man, who&s;e hou&s;e they fir&s;t plundered, and then &s;et it on fire; all this was done ju&s;t over again&s;t <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> from whence out of a &s;mall battery was di&s;charged a piece of ordnance, which by a good Providence was directed &s;o to fling its &s;hot, as it fell very near a party of the Indians, for they were &s;o affrighted therewith (if none of them
<PB N="226" REF="014120_0256_0F93022E9A428CA8">were killed) that they left a good part of their plun|der near the place. They were pur&s;ued by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h before they could recover their home, and by the help of the &s;now that fell about that time, were traced till they were overtaken, but being near a &s;wamp e&s;caped, thro' ha&s;te leaving two of their packs behind.</P>
<P>SOON after, they went up the river again to <HI>Quechecho,</HI> where they burnt a hou&s;e and two or three barns.&mdash; Another party of them got over or beyond the other branches of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> river, towards <HI>Exeter,</HI> and <HI>Lampney Eele</HI> river, where they killed one man. Ma|ny of them were &s;een in the woods about <HI>Exeter,</HI> and between <HI>Hampton</HI> and <HI>Exeter,</HI> where they killed one or two men in the woods as they were travelling home|wards, occa&s;ioning the people of tho&s;e towns to &s;tand continually upon their guard, which proved a great an|noyance to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>BUT let us look a little back to the plantations more ea&s;tward from <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> river, where the&s;e out|rages of the Indians fir&s;t began.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> Lieut. <HI>Inger&s;on</HI>'s &s;on with another man, going out a fowling about this time, were both killed before they returned home, his father's hou&s;es being burnt, with many others al&s;o thereabouts.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Black Point,</HI> Lieut. <HI>Augur</HI> with two more were a&s;&s;aulted by the Indians, where after many &s;hot ex|changed betwixt them, him&s;elf was &s;o wounded, that he died &s;oon after, and his brother al&s;o was killed with|in a few days after, not far from the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>WHEN the ri&s;ing of the Indians fir&s;t began in tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts (with us called the county of <HI>York&s;hire</HI>) Capt. <HI>Wincol</HI> of <HI>Newechewannick,</HI> with &s;ome others, having a &s;ympathy for the &s;ufferings of his neighbors, marched up that way with a &s;mall party of men. In his fir&s;t &s;kirmi&s;h with the enemy he chanced to lo&s;e two or three of his company; the re&s;t, not being a|bove

But nine <HI>Saco</HI> men had wor&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;s, who came with a good intention to help their friends, upon the hearing of their guns; but as they came to re&s;cue Capt <HI>Wincol</HI> with his &s;mall party, they them&s;elves fell into an ambu&s;h of the enemy, and &s;o were all cut off, with two other men al&s;o, near the place where the fir&s;t &s;kirmi&s;h was, for the Indians from the &s;hore &s;ide could di&s;cern any that were coming to|wards them when they were at a great di&s;tance, and &s;o might ea&s;ily way-lay them before they could come up to them. Near upon &s;even hou&s;es were burnt about this time, and &s;ome per&s;ons killed at <HI>Black Point.</HI></P>
<P>TWO per&s;ons were killed at <HI>Wells</HI> in the beginning of winter, one of them was a &s;ervant to Mr. <HI>William Symonds</HI> (one of the principal men in the town afore|&s;aid) the gentleman him&s;elf with his family were re|moved to a garri&s;on hou&s;e in the middle of the town. His &s;ervant going early in the morning to look after &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s there, tarried longer than was needful, to provide &s;omething for him&s;elf, the Indians invited them&s;elves to breakfa&s;t with him, making the poor fellow pay the &s;hot, when they had done, with the lo&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>A WEEK after one <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> was &s;lain at <HI>Wells</HI> likewi&s;e, who was a kind of a di&s;tracted fellow. Al&s;o one <HI>I&s;aac Cou&s;ins</HI> was there killed in the beginning of winter, after there had been &s;ome overtures of peace between Major <HI>Waldern</HI> and the Indians.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch kind of mutual encounters was the latter part of the year &s;pent betwixt the Indians and the En|gli&s;h
<PB N="228" REF="014120_0258_0F93023041B11EE8">from <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> river to <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> from the be|ginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the end of <HI>November,</HI> wherein many were &s;lain on both &s;ides; of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts were &s;lain upwards of fifty; the enemy lo&s;t, as appeared afterwards by their own confe&s;&s;ion, above 90, partly in the afore&s;aid &s;kirmi&s;hes, and partly in their joining with the Indians to the we&s;tward, whither it is &s;aid, many of them were invited to repair, to help de|&s;troy the Engli&s;h, in hopes to enjoy their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions afterwards; but God had otherwi&s;e determined, who did ari&s;e at la&s;t to &s;ave the meek ones of the earth, and plead the cau&s;e of his people.</P>
<P>THE Governor and Council of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> had at this time their hands full with the like attempts of <HI>Philip</HI> and his accomplices to the we&s;tward, yet were not unmindful of the deplorable condition of the&s;e ea&s;tern plantations; having committed the care there|of to the Majors of the re&s;pective regiments of the &s;e|veral counties on that &s;ide of the country, but more e&s;pecially to the care and prudence of the Honorable Major <HI>D.

<P>IN the latter end of <HI>June,</HI> 1676, the Indians that had made a general con&s;piracy again&s;t the Engli&s;h. were &s;trangely di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;pirited, &s;o that they from that time began to &s;eparate one from another, and every nation of them to &s;hift for them&s;elves, as hath already been mentioned in the former part of this nar|rative. <HI>Canonicus,</HI> the great Sachem of the <HI>Narrha|gan&s;ets,</HI> di&s;tru&s;ting the proffers of the Engli&s;h, was &s;lain in the woods by the <HI>Mobawks,</HI> his Squaw &s;urrender|ing her&s;elf, by this means her life was &s;pared.</P>
<P>MANY of tho&s;e about <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and the places ad|joining thereto, did cunningly endeavour to hide them|&s;elves among&s;t tho&s;e Indians about <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> that had newly made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h, by Major <HI>Waldern</HI>'s means, and concluded a peace, yee could neither di&s;&s;emble their nature and di&s;po&s;ition pa&s;t before from &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;chief, nor yet &s;o arti&s;icially conceal their per&s;ons, but they were ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by &s;uch as in former times had any acquaintance with the ea&s;tern Indians by way of trade, or other conver&s;e: Whereupon the forces newly rai&s;ed in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> under the command of Capt. <HI>William H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thonne,</HI> and

<P>THOSE who had been always peaceable and true to the Engli&s;h, never intermeddling in the quarrel, as <HI>Wannalancet,</HI> the Sagamore of <HI>Pennicook,</HI> and &s;ome others, were quietly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to their own places. Be&s;ides tho&s;e that were &s;urprized at the time afore&s;aid, there were &s;everal others who had been the chief actors, that were taken up and down in tho&s;e woods beyond <HI>Merrimack,</HI> and &s;o were delivered up to ju&s;tice; as <HI>John Manoco,</HI> Sagamore <HI>Sam,</HI> old <HI>Jethro,</HI> with &s;ome others, as hath been already mentioned, yet young <HI>Jethro</HI> brought in 40 at one time. It was a &s;pecial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vor from God &s;o to order it, that the Indians afore|&s;aid, were &s;o &s;urprized; for had they continued in their former rebellion, and had taken the opportunity
<PB N="231" REF="014120_0261_0F930233B9297410">to have joined with the ea&s;tern Indians, as &s;ome of them did a few months before, they would in all likeli|hood have utterly de&s;troyed all the plantations of the Engli&s;h beyond <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> river, as manife&s;tly appears by the mi&s;chief which was lately done by means of a few, that by too much connivance of &s;ome in tho&s;e parts, that entertained a better opinion of them than it &s;eems they de&s;erved. For whereas mention was for|merly made of a &s;mall party of Indians, that on the 3d day of <HI>May,</HI> in this pre&s;ent year, had murdered one <HI>Thomas Kembel,</HI> of <HI>Bradford,</HI> and carried away his wife and 5 children captive; yet two or three of the actors did, upon what con&s;ideration is not known, return the woman and children again within &s;ix weeks, and becau&s;e of their voluntarily returning of them, were dealt more favorably with; being only put into pri&s;on at <HI>Dover,</HI> for a time; yet po&s;&s;ibly conceiving that a pri&s;on was but a preparation for a wor&s;e evil, they took an opportunity (two of the chief actors in the afore&s;aid mi&s;chief, one called <HI>Simon,</HI> the other <HI>Andrew</HI>) to convey them&s;elves out of the place of re|&s;traint, and afterwards going among&s;t the <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> and <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians, have joined with them in tho&s;e bloody and cruel depredations lately made in tho&s;e parts, which follow in order next to be related.</P>
<P>SOME little colour or pretence of injury was alledged before tho&s;e ea&s;tern Indians began their outrage, both in the former, as well as in the pre&s;ent year; the chief actor or rather the beginner of all the afore&s;aid mi&s;|chiefs ea&s;tward, is one <HI>Squande,</HI> the Sagamore of <HI>Saco</HI> Indians, who&s;e Squaw, as is &s;aid, was abu&s;ed by a rude and indi&s;creet act of &s;ome Engli&s;h &s;eaman, the la&s;t &s;ummer, 1675, who either over&s;et the canoe where|in the &s;aid &s;quaw with her child were &s;ailing in a river thereabouts, or el&s;e to try whether the children of the Indians as they had heard, could &s;wim as naturally as any other creatures, wittingly ca&s;t her child into the water; but the &s;quaw immediately diving into the water after it, fetched it up from the bottom of the ri|ver, yet it &s;o falling out that within a while after the
<PB N="232" REF="014120_0262_0F930233F4B4BCA0">&s;aid child died (which it might have done if no &s;uch affront had been offered) the &s;aid <HI>Squando,</HI> fa|ther of the child, hath been &s;o provoked thereat, that he hath ever &s;ince &s;et him&s;elf to do all the mi&s;chief he can to the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts, and was never as yet, &s;ince that time, truly willing to be reconciled, although he is &s;aid to have &s;ent home &s;ome that were taken cap|tive the la&s;t year. Surely if their hearts had not been &s;ecretly filled with malice and revenge before, they might have obtained &s;atisfaction for the wrong done at an ea&s;ier rate; more probable it is that this was only an occa&s;ion to vent the mi&s;chief they had formerly conceived in their hearts.</P>
<P>THERE is an injury of an higher nature, mentioned as the ground of their quarrel with us who live about <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> and <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> which happened the la&s;t &s;pring, viz. one <HI>Laughton,</HI> with another per&s;on or more, who having obtained under the hand of Major <HI>Waldern,</HI> a warrant to &s;eize any Indians ea&s;tward that had been guilty of any murder or &s;poil done to the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts, did (mo&s;t perfidiou&s;ly and wick|edly entice &s;ome of the Indians about <HI>Cape Sables,</HI> who never had been in the lea&s;t manner guilty of any injury done to the Engli&s;h) on board their ve&s;&s;el, or el&s;e &s;ome other way, and then carried them away to fell them for &s;laves; which the Indians in tho&s;e parts look upon as an injury done to them&s;elves, and have alledged it to the inhabitants of <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> as one of the principal grounds of their pre&s;ent quarrel: The thing alledged is too true as to matter of fact, and the per&s;ons that did it were lately committed to pri&s;on in order to their further trial. Yet all tho&s;e Indians do, or may know full well, that they who did them that wrong, were liable to due puni&s;hment (or el&s;e their quarrel might be uncounted ju&s;t, and they con&s;idered as Indians, mu&s;t have the more allowance) if they could be found, nor ever were any countenanced a|mong&s;t us, that had done them any kind of injury, nor did tho&s;e that take upon them the revenging of the injury, know that they were inhabitants of this
<PB N="233" REF="014120_0263_0F930234A44D1B28">country that did the wrong; nor was there ever any orderly complaint made thereof; but this cannot ex|cu&s;e their perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty. Some other pre|tences alledged by the &s;aid Indians that yet do bear no proportion to the mention of a wrong or injury, viz. becau&s;e our traders were forbidden to fell any ammuni|tion to any Indians what&s;oever; which tho&s;e Indians &s;ay they cannot live without; yet &s;eeing they them|&s;elves, as well as the we&s;tward Indians have &s;o ill im|proved that which they had before, there was little rea&s;on why they &s;hould quarrel with us for felling no more.</P>
<P>FURTHER al&s;o, it is affirmed by &s;ome per&s;ons wor|thy of credit, that for divers years pa&s;t have lived in tho&s;e parts, that the Indians thereabouts need not have wanted powder or &s;hot, only they wanted &s;omething wherewith to cloak their malicious and barbarous practices of late committed again&s;t us; but there be|ing different opinions about this point, we &s;hall leave it for the pre&s;ent. But this being premi&s;ed in reference to the pretended ground, or occa&s;ion of the quarrel, it remains that the effects thereof be now related.</P>
<P>BEFORE the war with <HI>Philip</HI> was well ended to the &s;outhward, there was a fre&s;h alarm founded again to the ea&s;tward; for on the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1676, the very day before <HI>Philip</HI>'s heart, that had harboured &s;o many mi&s;chievous and treacherous devices again&s;t the Engli&s;h, was by one of his own company &s;hot through, a party of Indians began their outrages at <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> in a mo&s;t perfidious and treacherous manner, killing and carring away captive, to the number of 30 per&s;ons, and burning their hou&s;es; among&s;t whom was the family of one <HI>Anthory Bracket,</HI> an inhabitant of <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> who was thought to have been killed, but he him&s;elf, with his wife, and one of his five children car|ried away captive, with a negro, did happily make an e&s;cape from their bloody and deceitful hands, in <HI>No|vember</HI> next en&s;uing.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="014120_0264_0F9302355EDB1FC8">
THE manner how <HI>Anthony Bracket</HI> and his wife made their e&s;cape was very remarkable, and therefore judged worthy to be here in&s;erted, although out of due place. The Indians that led them captive, having brought them to the north &s;ide of <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> news was brought to the &s;aid Indians of the &s;urprizal of <HI>Arow&s;ick</HI> hou&s;e, in <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> with all the &s;tores therein, which did &s;o rejoice them, that they made all ha&s;te to &s;hare in the good things there to be had: Thus eager to be gone, they promi&s;ed <HI>Bracket</HI> and his wife that they al&s;o &s;hould have a &s;hare therein if they would make ha&s;te after them, bringing along a bur|then alloted to each of them: The woman having a little before ob&s;erved an old birch canoe lying by the water &s;ide, hoped it was an opportunity Providence offered for their e&s;cape; whereupon &s;he fir&s;t prudently a&s;ked the Indians to let the negro, their own &s;ervant (at the &s;ame time carried captive by them) help them to carry their burthens, which was granted; then &s;he begged of them a piece or two of meat, which was not denyed them. Thus being furni&s;hed with help and provi&s;ion, the Indians leaving them behind to come after with their &s;everal burthens, and a young child, they could not but look upon it as a <HI>nutrus Di|vinus,</HI> to bid them &s;hift for them&s;elves: The woman al&s;o found a needle and thread in the hou&s;e, with which &s;he mended the canoe, while they tarried on that &s;ide of the bay, in which they &s;oon ventured to get away, which pro&s;perou&s;ly &s;ucceeded; for in that old canoe they cro&s;&s;ed a water eight or nine miles broad, and when they came on the &s;outh &s;ide of the bay, they might have been in as much danger of other Indians, that had lately been about <HI>Black-Point,</HI> and had taken it; but they were newly gone: So things on all &s;ides thus concurring to help forward their deliverance, they came &s;afely to the fat at <HI>Black-Point,</HI> where al&s;o by &s;pecial Providence they met with a ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Pi&s;cataqua.</HI> that came into that harbour but a few hours before they came thither, by which means they attived &s;afe in <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> river &s;oon after; all which circum&s;tances are very worthy to be noted.</P>

AMONGST tho&s;e Indians that &s;eized this <HI>Bracket</HI>'s family, the Chief was one <HI>Simon,</HI> who had but a little before e&s;caped out of <HI>Dover</HI> pri&s;on, where he was not carefully overlooked; he had had his hand in the murder of &s;undry Engli&s;h, as he had confe&s;&s;ed; not mi&s;&s;ing any, &s;ave one, on whom he had di&s;charged his gun; but becau&s;e he came in voluntarily, bring|ing in a woman and 5 children of the Engli&s;h, who had been carried captive a little before, it was que&s;tion|ed whether his la&s;t act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion might not balance his former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and therefore he was com|mitted to that, not &s;o &s;ecure a pri&s;on, till his ca&s;e might be further con&s;idered of. It is &s;aid that coming to that <HI>Bracket</HI>'s hou&s;e over night, he pulled forth a counterfeited pa&s;s, under the hands of &s;ome public officers, or men intru&s;ted with that &s;ervice, making &s;hew of all friend&s;hip; but in the morning, or &s;oon after, he pulled off the vizor of a friend, and di&s;cover|ed what he was; yet granting life to this per&s;on and his family, that did not, or could not re&s;i&s;t, which he denied to &s;omeof the neighbours not far off, who were many of them killed by this bloody villian and his partners.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome circum&s;tances in the a&s;&s;ault of <HI>Anthony Bracket</HI>'s hou&s;e very con&s;iderable, which, be|cau&s;e it was the fir&s;t outrage committed by the Indians in this their &s;econd in&s;urrection, 1676, are worthy of a more particular remembering.</P>
<P>THIS Indian beforementioned, called <HI>Simon,</HI> after he had e&s;caped out of the pri&s;on at <HI>Dover,</HI> came to <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> and either in the end of <HI>July</HI> or beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> acquainted him&s;elf with this <HI>Anthony Bracket,</HI> and oft frequented his hou&s;e. Upon the 9th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> &s;ome of the Indians having killed a cow of his, the Indian <HI>Simon</HI> coming to his hou&s;e promi&s;ed to bring the Indians to him that had killed his cow. In the mean time they of the place &s;ent two men to Major <HI>Waldern</HI>'s at <HI>Dover,</HI> to complain of this injury done by the Indians, but before their return, very early in
<PB N="236" REF="014120_0266_0F930236D89F2578">the morning on the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t, Simon</HI> with a party of Indians came to <HI>Anthony Bracket</HI>'s hou&s;e, and told him there were the Indians that had killed his cow; but as &s;oon as they had &s;aid that, the Indians went further in|to his hou&s;e and took hold of all the guns they could &s;ee; <HI>Bracket</HI> a&s;ked what was the meaning of that, <HI>Si|mon</HI> replied, that &s;o it mu&s;t be, a&s;king him withal, whether he had rather &s;erve the Indians, or be &s;lain by them, to which he an&s;wered, that if the ca&s;e were &s;o, he would rather chu&s;e to &s;erve them than be killed by them; <HI>Simon</HI> replied, that then they mu&s;t be bound, which was pre&s;ently done. The &s;aid <HI>Bracket,</HI> his wife, and a negro were all bound by the Indians; his wife and a brother, who offering to re&s;i&s;t was killed forthwith, the re&s;t, with five children were led away pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>TWO hours after, one <HI>Pike,</HI> that lived not far off, but knowing nothing of all this, went up in a canoe toward one <HI>Robert Corbin</HI>'s hou&s;e, where he found one <HI>Humphry Durham</HI> and <HI>Benjamin At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el</HI> at work about their hay; after a little &s;tay, he lo&s;t them, intending to go up higher with his canoe. but as &s;oon as he was a little pa&s;t, he heard the report of guns, which made him with another man he had with him pre&s;ently re|turn back; before he came beyond <HI>Corban</HI>'s hou&s;e he &s;aw an Engli&s;h boy running with all ha&s;te, which made him fear &s;ome mi&s;chief was in hand, and pre&s;ently a volley of &s;hot came again&s;t them, but the bullets flying over their heads, did them no hurt; pre&s;ently <HI>Simon</HI> appeared, and called them to come on &s;hore; but they liked not his courte&s;y, and turning their canoe into the &s;tream, got out of the reach of their guns, ha&s;ting down to his own hou&s;e with all &s;peed; when he came near to his hou&s;e, he called to the people to make ha&s;te a|way towards the garri&s;on-hou&s;e, and bid the re&s;t look to them&s;elves, and fire upon the Indians that were com|ing again&s;t them: In the mean while the Indians pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Anthony Bracket</HI>'s to <HI>Corban</HI>'s, killed <HI>Corban</HI> him|&s;elf, together with <HI>Humph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Durham</HI> and <HI>Benjamin At|wel</HI> beforementioned; then pa&s;&s;ing on to other hou&s;es,
<PB N="237" REF="014120_0267_0F930239DBB9C358">killed &s;ome, and carried others away captive. At one of the next hou&s;es the women and children got off into the water by a canoe; but one <HI>James Ro&s;s,</HI> his wife and children were carried away. <HI>Corban</HI>'s wife, with one of the other men's wives, and the children of ano|ther, they carried away likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>IN another &s;ide of the town as three per&s;ons were going to reap at <HI>Anthony Bracket</HI>'s, pa&s;&s;ing from an hou&s;e where they left their canoe, met with <HI>John Mountjoy</HI> and one <HI>Wakely,</HI> to whom they told what had happened, &s;oon after they heard two guns fired, whereby it &s;eems two men were killed; wherefore coming back toward <HI>Thomas Bracket</HI>'s, where they had left their canoe, they &s;aw him &s;hot down by the Indians; one of the three not &s;o well able to run, hid him&s;elf in the bu&s;hes in hope to make his e&s;cape more conveni|ently afterwards, which accordingly he did; but in the mean time he &s;aw the Indians carry away <HI>Thomas Brac|ket</HI>'s wife and children. Soon after the three men a|fore&s;aid, got &s;afe to Mr. <HI>Mountjoy</HI>'s garri&s;on, but not tru&s;ting to the &s;ecurity of that garri&s;on, they &s;oon after repaired to an i&s;land in the bay, called <HI>James Andrew</HI>'s i&s;land. One <HI>George Lewis</HI> and his wife tarried all this time in their hou&s;e till the next day, when they had op|portunity to get &s;afe to the i&s;land afore&s;aid, together with the two men that were now returned from Major <HI>Waldern;</HI> whither they had been &s;ent, but too late, to make complaint of the Indians that had counterfeit|ed his pa&s;s to travel into tho&s;e parts, and had done this mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THE day after, one <HI>George Felt,</HI> &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t by rea&s;on of a &s;moke he &s;aw on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the town, took his wife and children into a canoe to &s;ee what the matter was, but when he came near a point of land not far off, he found &s;everal of his neighbors goods, which made him conclude their owners were killed, which was a &s;ufficient warning to him likewi&s;e to fly for his life, which he did to the &s;ame i&s;land. After a number of them had e&s;caped thither, they re|collected
<PB N="238" REF="014120_0268_0F93023AD97983D0">that they had left powder behind them in one or two places; whereupon they determined to venture a party of them in the night, to prevent the Indians from having any advantage thereby, and for their own defence if occa&s;ion &s;hould require; accordingly their attempt &s;ucceeded well, for they brought away a barrel of powder from one <HI>Well</HI>'s hou&s;e, and likewi&s;e a con&s;i|derable quantity out of a che&s;t in a &s;tore hou&s;e, where the Indians had been ran&s;acking, and had taken things out of the other end of the che&s;t, yet overlooked the powder. In this &s;urprizal of the plantation in <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> called <HI>Falmouth,</HI> there were 34 per&s;ons killed and carried into captivity.</P>
<P>THAT this was not a ca&s;ual attempt, but a de&s;igned plot, will appear, in that ju&s;t about the &s;ame time, the Indians at <HI>Kennebeck</HI> made the like in&s;urrection, where|by it is concluded, either that the Indians which e&s;ca|ped from <HI>Dover</HI> &s;tirred them up thereunto, or el&s;e that the &s;aid Indians finding them in a di&s;po&s;ition tending that way, by rea&s;on of &s;ome injuries done tho&s;e that dwell farther northward, they offered their &s;ervice to help forward the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IT is to be noted here that the Indians about <HI>Kenne|beck</HI> were per&s;uaded to continue their former amity with the Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the report of <HI>Philip</HI>'s ri&s;ing that year before, and the outrages committed the la&s;t autumn and winter following; yet which is more, they had lately renewed their league with the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts, although they had often complained to tho&s;e of <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> of the injury they &s;uffered in the with-holding from them the trade of powder and &s;hot, without which they &s;aid they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and for want of which, it is alledged by them&s;elves, that &s;ome of them peri&s;hed the la&s;t winter.</P>
<P>BUT the quarrel of late fallen out betwixt the En|gli&s;h and the Indians about <HI>Kennebeck</HI> and ea&s;tward thereof, being a matter of great importance, it &s;hall, for the &s;atisfaction of the reader, in what follows be
<PB N="239" REF="014120_0269_0F93023B7B528218">more particularly de&s;cribed, it being the duty of every one that publi&s;heth things of this nature, to do the right of an hi&s;torian to all who are any ways concern|ed in what is made public. The information was re|ceived from a prudent per&s;on, an eye and ear witne&s;s of all that happened among&s;t the &s;aid Indians both the former and the pre&s;ent year, and one that was more publickly concerned in tho&s;e tran&s;actions than &s;ome o|thers, therefore the more credit may be given thereto.</P>
<P>MENTION is already made of what happened in <HI>September,</HI> 1675, to the company belonging to a &s;loop and two boats that went up <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> to gather corn. upon that accident it is &s;aid divers Indians on the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river repaired to their fort at <HI>Toton|nock</HI> (a place higher up into the country beyond <HI>Kenne|beck</HI> and <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> river) where was an Engli&s;h trading hou&s;e: And the Indians ea&s;tward of &s;aid river, had as yet done no harm to any of the Engli&s;h, yet did Capt. <HI>Sylvanus Davis,</HI> agent for Major <HI>Clarke</HI> and Capt. <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> upon the&s;e overtures think fit to fetch down the powder and &s;hot, with other goods from the &s;aid trading hou&s;e, telling the Indians, by the me&s;|&s;enger &s;ent up, he would have them come down and live below in that river, to take off jealou&s;ies, and that he would then &s;opply them with what was needful.&mdash; But the me&s;&s;enger told them in ca&s;e they would not come down and deliver up their arms the Engli&s;h would kill them. <HI>He that &s;endeth a me&s;&s;age by the hand of a fool,</HI> faith Solomon, <HI>cutteth off the foet, and drink|eth damage.</HI> This me&s;&s;age was delivered by him as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, but who put it into his mouth, or whether it was the device of his own heart, does not at pre&s;ent concern us to enquire, but the damage that &s;ide of the country hath &s;u&s;tained thereby is not ea&s;y to recount; for upon this threatning me&s;&s;age the Indians for&s;ook their fort and went further ea&s;tward, and &s;ent abroad to <HI>John</HI>'s river and to the &s;ea &s;ide, to get all the Indians they could together to come up <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> river.</P>

A GENTLEMAN who at that time lived at <HI>Pemma|quid,</HI> a kind of &s;uperintendent over the affairs of that place, con&s;idering the &s;ad &s;tate things were running in|to, laboured to obtain a parly with the &s;aid Indians, or with &s;ome of them, which after much trouble and co&s;t he did accompli&s;h. But in the mean time, &s;uch was the violence u&s;ed by &s;ome refractory Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts, that they could &s;carce be re&s;trained from offering violence to the per&s;ons he &s;ent up as me&s;&s;engers, or o|thers that lived quietly among&s;t them, and did al&s;o as violently &s;et them&s;elves up to oppo&s;e him or any others that acted with more moderation than the re&s;t; pro|te&s;ting again&s;t them as tho&s;e who for gain &s;upplyed the Indians with powder and &s;hot, and &s;aid they would kill any Indian they met; others at <HI>Monhiggon</HI> offered five pounds for every Indian that &s;hould be brought, yet would not the&s;e per&s;ons that were &s;o violent again&s;t the Indians in their di&s;cour&s;e, be per&s;uaded then or af|terwards to go out to fight the Indians in an orderly way, as appeared both by their &s;ecurity in not acting better upon their guard, and by their &s;udden flight af|terwards, running away like a flock of &s;heep, at the barking of any little dog. Things being in this po&s;|ture, what could be expected but a pre&s;ent war with the Indians, although as it &s;eems, there were few or none to be found willing to undertake it, or fit to ma|nage it in tho&s;e parts. However, the per&s;on afore&s;aid under&s;tanding the general court at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> had appoint|ed a council of war at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> applied him&s;elf to them, laying before them the de&s;perate &s;tate things were falling into; whereupon they i&s;&s;ued out warrants to re|&s;train all manner of per&s;ons from meddling with the Indians without further order, which within a few days &s;hould be had. In the mean time the Sachems of the Indians met at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> where after many com|plaints made of the hard dealing of the Engli&s;h in <HI>Ken|nebeck</HI> river, they came to terms of peace, promi&s;ing to keep true friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h, and to hinder the <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> Indians from meddling with the En|gli&s;h, if by any means the could, and al&s;o to return peaceably in the &s;pring of the year. This gentleman
<PB N="241" REF="014120_0271_0F93023CE3275FD8">afore&s;aid, having a long time waited to go to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was willing to take the opportunity of the pre&s;ent win|ter, hoping things were now pretty well &s;ettled in tho&s;e parts between the Indians and the Engli&s;h, found &s;oon after that he was cited thither to an&s;wer &s;ome com|plaints, though ill grounded, for &s;elling powder and &s;hot to the Indians contrary to order. But tho&s;e fal&s;e opinions being ea&s;ily blown away by his own appear|ance at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and having di&s;patched his bu&s;ine&s;s there, he returned before the winter was over to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> where hearing of a ve&s;&s;el that intended to take Indians in tho&s;e parts and carry them away to market, which he had many &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe, (it being no hard matter to &s;urprize many &s;uch, that &s;u&s;pecting no fraud, would ea&s;ily be enticed aboard a ve&s;&s;el to trade, or may be to drink liquor) &s;ent to both the ma&s;ter and company, if they had any &s;uch intent, to forbear, &s;ee|ing tho&s;e Indians were at peace with us; and likewi&s;e to the Indians, to inform them of &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el, and to be aware thereof; but yet it &s;eems the ma&s;ter and company took &s;everal Indians ea&s;tward, who were al&s;o at peace with us, and to our great &s;orrow &s;hipt them on board for a market.</P>
<P>THE winter being now over, the aforementioned agent of <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> went to a meeting of the Indians ea&s;tward, to per&s;uade them of the country's willingne&s;s to continue a peace with them. They &s;eemed very joyful thereat, and in the &s;pring brought &s;ome pre&s;ents to confirm the peace, and to that end al&s;o delivered up an Engli&s;h captive boy to tho&s;e of <HI>Kennebeck.</HI> But when the &s;ummer came on, the &s;aid Indians having li|berty to travel up and down the country to vi&s;it their friends as they u&s;ed to do, they mi&s;&s;ed many of them, who had in the winter been perfidiou&s;ly carried away. and as is related, they fell into a rage again&s;t the En|gli&s;h, making complaint thereof to the &s;aid agent, Mr. <HI>Earthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard Oliver,</HI> and others. They were told means &s;hould be u&s;ed for bringing them back a|gain, which had been &s;o tran&s;ported. Tho&s;e to whom
<PB N="242" REF="014120_0272_0F93023D9E55B388">the complaint was made, did &s;carce believe it to be true, not having heard thereof from any other hand, and probably hoping none, e&s;pecially after &s;uch &s;o|lemn warning, would deal &s;o perfidiou&s;ly with hea|thens, to lay &s;uch a &s;tumbling block before them.</P>
<P>THE Indians being certain of the thing done, could not be ea&s;ily pacified, being likewi&s;e incen&s;ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h for with-holding the trade of powder and &s;hot the la&s;t winter, &s;aying they were frighted from their corn the la&s;t year by the people about <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> in&s;omuch that many of them died in the following win|ter for want of powder and &s;hot wherewith to kill veni&s;on and foul; adding withal, that if the Engli&s;h were their friends as they pretended, they would not &s;uffer them to die for want thereof. However, the &s;aid agent making the be&s;t he could of a bad cau&s;e, u&s;ed all means to pacify the complainants, and to that end promi&s;ed them that if they would meet with any of the <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> Indians (who had all along the bit|tere&s;t enmity again&s;t the Engli&s;h) he would give them a meeting to treat in order to a peace, Major <HI>Waldern</HI> having already concluded a peace with the <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> Indians, and by that means, if they could conclude the like peace with the <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> men (that could not yet be found) there would be a general peace with all the Indians ea&s;tward of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> which the Indians that were pre&s;ent at this di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed very joyful at. Yet &s;till by one fatal accident or another, j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alou&s;ies &s;till &s;eemed to increa&s;e in their minds, or el&s;e the former injuries began to boil a fre&s;h in their &s;pirits, as not being ea&s;ily dige&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, whatever had been &s;aid or done to allay the offen&s;ivene&s;s thereof.

<PB N="243" REF="014120_0273_0F93023E63DA7B68">the council then &s;itting in <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> how to carry on their treaty. After they had gone part of the way to|wards <HI>Totonnock,</HI> they came to an Engli&s;h hou&s;e, where they were cold what great jealou&s;ies of deceit in the Indians were upon their &s;pirits, from what they had heard of <HI>Mug,</HI> and <HI>Tarumkin,</HI> an <HI>Amo&s;coggan</HI> Sachem. Going further, to a place called <HI>Kedonucook,</HI> they met with Indians, who were very &s;hy of telling them any thing; which, added to their former intimation, great|ly increa&s;ed their fears; but being re&s;olved on their voyage, they proceeded in their way thither, yet failing &s;hort of the place on purpo&s;e, that they might fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s with them the next day. When they came to their fort, they were fir&s;t faluted with a volley of &s;hot, then brought into a wigwam where their Sa|chems were: <HI>Madockawando</HI> &s;at as chief, who now &s;tiles him&s;elf their mini&s;ter.

<P>IT was without doubt no &s;mall trouble to their minds, in a treaty with the&s;e Pagans, <HI>baec diei potui&s;&s;e, and non potui&s;&s;e refelli:</HI> Yet to put the be&s;t con&s;truction might be, on &s;uch irregular actions, which could not well be ju&s;tified, they told them the per&s;ons who had &s;o done, were not within the limits of their go|vernment, and therefore though they could not call them to an account for &s;o acting, yet they did utterly di&s;allow thereof; adding further, as &s;oon as we under|&s;tood

<P>UPON the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1676, &s;everal Indians repaired in the evening to the hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Ham|mond,</HI> an ancient inhabitant, and trader with the In|dians up <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river; his daughter, or a maid that was &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, either naturally afraid of the natives, or el&s;e from &s;omething &s;he ob&s;erved in their countenance or carriage, manife&s;ted &s;o much &s;ear, as made her run out of the hou&s;e to hide her&s;elf in &s;ome place abroad; the Indians perceiving it, the more to di&s;&s;emble their treachery, ran after her, and brought her into the hou&s;e, telling her (although they could not per&s;uade her &s;o to believe) that there was no rea&s;on to be afraid of them; pre&s;ently after more of the barbarous villians coming into the hou&s;e, &s;he grew more afraid than before, being now more &s;trongly per&s;uaded that they came on purpo&s;e to kill or &s;urprize tho&s;e in the family, whereupon &s;he &s;uddenly made an e&s;cape out the hou&s;e, and pre&s;ently pa&s;&s;ed into a field of Indian corn, whereby &s;he might the better avoid the danger of any pur&s;uer, and &s;o ran acro&s;s over the land that night, ten or twelve miles, to give them no|tice that lived at <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> river; it is &s;aid that after &s;he got out, &s;he heard a noi&s;e in the hou&s;e, as if they
<PB N="246" REF="014120_0276_0F930241DA2A7C80">were fighting or &s;cuffling within doors; but &s;he did not count it wi&s;dom to go back and &s;ee what the mat|ter was, knowing before enough of their villanies, how well &s;oever her mi&s;tre&s;s (that was more ver&s;ed in the trade of the Indians) might think of them. Tho&s;e of <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> taking this warning, e&s;caped away as &s;oon as they could, leaving their cattle and dwellings as a prey to the Indians. What befel ma&s;ter <HI>Hammond</HI> and his family, is not yet certainly known: Reports pa&s;s up and down, that &s;ome who came down the river after|wards, &s;aw &s;ome of the dead &s;tripped upon the banks of the river, which makes us fear the wor&s;t concerning all the re&s;t; for certainly the whole family, 16 in number, were all at that time either killed or carried away captive, none &s;ave the maid afore&s;aid, being known to make an e&s;cape, to inform their friends, like <HI>Job</HI>'s me&s;&s;engers, what befel the re&s;t of the family.</P>
<P>THE Indians having in this manner &s;urprized Mr. <HI>Hammand</HI>'s hou&s;e, they pa&s;&s;ed down the river the &s;ame night, but going by another hou&s;e, they med|dled not with the people, only turned their canoes adrift, that they might not find means afterwards to e&s;cape them&s;elves, or help others &s;o to do: Po&s;&s;ibly their chief aim being at <HI>Arow&s;ick</HI> hou&s;e, they would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for fear of being di&s;covered, make any attempt upon any place near by; wherefore, the 14th of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> very early in the morning, having in the night, or before break of day, pa&s;&s;ed over on to the i&s;land called <HI>Arow&s;ick;</HI> &s;everal of them undi&s;covered lay hid under the walls of the fort, and behind a great rock near adjoining, till the &s;entinel was gone off from his pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> (who went off it &s;eems &s;ooner than he &s;hould, con&s;idering the danger) when pre&s;ently &s;ome Indians followed him in at the fort gate (as &s;ome report) while others of them immediately &s;eized the port holes there|of, and &s;hot down all they &s;aw pa&s;&s;ing up and down within the walls, and &s;o in a little time became ma&s;|ters of the fore, and all that was within it: Capt. <HI>Lake</HI> (joint owner with Major <HI>Clarke,</HI> of the whole

Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> being badly wounded, could neither tru&s;t to his legs to fly, nor yet make u&s;e of his hands to fight, yet was &s;trangely pre&s;erved; Providence directing him to go into the cleft of a rock, ear by the place where he fir&s;t landed; the Indians by the glittering of the fun beams in their eyes as they came a&s;hore, did not di&s;|cern him; &s;o that lying hid under the covert of the hand of Providence for two days, he at la&s;t crawled a little above the water &s;ide, till he found a canoe, whereby he e&s;caped with his life. The other two were better foot men, and parting with Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> made their e&s;cape ten or twelve miles, to the farther end of the i&s;land, and &s;o e&s;caped from the Indians, till they found means to get off Poor Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> who a few hours before &s;lept quietly in his man&s;ion hou&s;e, fur|rounded with a &s;trong fortification, defended with many &s;oldiers, is now forced to fly away with none to

Capt. <HI>Lake</HI> was &s;lain at that time, al|though many hopes were for &s;ome time entertained that he was taken alive, and kept with other captives among&s;t the Indians; and it is &s;aid the Indians of tho&s;e parts did not intend to kill him, if they could have helped it; but it was known his hat was &s;een upon an Indian's head not long after, which made his friends conclude what had befallen that good man, who might emphatically be &s;o termed, in di&s;tinction from them that may truly be called ju&s;t men, and no more: For it &s;eems according to the ju&s;t agreement betwixt him|&s;elf and his part owner of <HI>Arow&s;ick</HI> i&s;land, it was not his turn this year to have been upon the place, but &s;uch was his goodne&s;s, that he yielded to the de&s;ire of his friend and partner, as in his room and &s;tead to take upon him&s;elf that &s;ervice in this time of danger; it is hoped his goodne&s;s in future time will not be for|gotten by &s;uch as were any way concerned therein, or had advantage thereby.</P>
<P>THIS i&s;land (called <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> from an Indian &s;o named that formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and of whom it was purcha&s;ed by one Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> who &s;old it to Capt. <HI>Lake</HI> and Major <HI>Clarke</HI>) lies up ten miles within the mouth of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river; it is &s;ome miles in length, and contains many thou&s;and acres of very good land; where meadow and arable ground are in a good pro|portion well &s;uited together. Within the fort afore&s;aid, were many convenient buildings for &s;everal officers, as well for wares and trading, as habitation: Six &s;e|veral
<PB N="249" REF="014120_0279_0F930243B9F2BF50">edifices are &s;aid to have been there erected. The warehou&s;e at that time was well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of goods; be&s;ides a mill and other accommodations and dwellings, within a mile of the fort and man&s;ion hou&s;e; &s;ome inhabitants of which hardly made their e&s;cape upon the fir&s;t &s;urprizal of the fort.</P>
<P>ALL which con&s;idered, the lo&s;s that befel the pro|prietors at the &s;urprizal of this i&s;land, &s;eems to be very great, valued at many thou&s;ands; but tho&s;e that were the owners, with others of late times, have found from their own experience, what <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aid of old, <HI>there is a time to get, and a time to lo&s;e, a time to keep, and a time to ca&s;t away; a time to break down, as well as a time to build up.</HI> The per&s;ons killed and taken at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> both at Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI>'s, and at <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> are &s;aid to be 53.</P>
<P>UPON the report of this &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, all the plan|tations of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts were &s;oon after left, and for&s;aken by degrees. All the re&s;t of the in|habitants of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river, <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> river, <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> and <HI>Damanicottee,</HI> fearing to be &s;erved in the &s;ame kind, fled to the i&s;lands of <HI>Cape Bonawagan,</HI> and <HI>Damaril</HI>'s <HI>Cove.</HI></P>
<P>ON the &s;econd day at night a po&s;t was &s;ent to <HI>Pem|maquid</HI> to inform them of what had happened, who being but eight or ten men, had a mind to go on the i&s;land called <HI>Monbiggon,</HI> having &s;ecured the be&s;t of their goods, but the wind taking them &s;hort, they were forced to turn into <HI>Damaril's Cove,</HI> where they found Mr. <HI>Wi&s;wall,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Colicot;</HI> there they laboured two days to &s;ettle a garri&s;on; but thro' the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of the people, and the want of provi&s;ion, nothing could be done to &s;ecure the i&s;land, &s;o that it was &s;oon de&s;erted. From thence they went to <HI>Monbig|gon,</HI> re&s;olving there to tarry till they heard from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> from whence Mr. <HI>Colicot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wi&s;wall</HI> promi&s;ed to do their utmo&s;t endeavor to &s;end help. There they &s;ettled three guards, and appointed 25 to watch every
<PB N="250" REF="014120_0280_0F9302445B3126B0">night, not knowing but that the Indians might come every hour. But continuing there a fortnight, and finding no relief like to come, and &s;eeing all the coun|try burnt round about, (for after they had got all that could be &s;aved from <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> they &s;aw all the other i&s;lands, <HI>Windgin</HI>'s, <HI>Corbin</HI>'s <HI>Sound, New-Harbour,</HI> and <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> all on fire in two hours time) then con&s;idering what was be&s;t to be done, they found no boats could be &s;ent to &s;ea for fear of weakening the i&s;land, and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were on it were &s;trangers, coa&s;ters, and &s;uch as came from the main, and ready to be gone upon every occa&s;ion, they laid an embargo for one week; after which a let|ter was received from Major <HI>Clarke,</HI> de&s;iring their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance for enquiring after Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> if alive, &s;aying, what could be had at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> &amp;c. but intimating nothing of any help like to come; be&s;ides, tho&s;e that brought the letter told them it was in vain to expect any help from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> it being que&s;tioned there what they had to do with tho&s;e parts. Upon which the in|habitants con&s;idered, that if they &s;hould tarry there and &s;pend all their provi&s;ion, and neither be able to go to &s;ea, nor yet to live, or be &s;afe a&s;hore for want of help, it were better for them to remove while they had &s;ome|thing to live upon, and &s;eek employment el&s;ewhere; &s;o by con&s;ent they re&s;olved forthwith to tran&s;port them|&s;elves and what they had &s;aved of their goods, to &s;ome place of &s;ecurity, &s;o they &s;ailed the fir&s;t opportunity, &s;ome for <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> &s;ome for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;ome for <HI>Salem,</HI> at one of which places they all &s;afely arrived.</P>
<P>HAVING thus e&s;caped at fir&s;t, as <HI>Lot</HI> out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> but not counting them&s;elves &s;afe in that <HI>Zoar,</HI> where for a little while they made out to hide their heads, till they might e&s;cape to &s;ome &s;urer place, there wait|ing for better times, when they may with peace and quietne&s;s return to their former habitations, or &s;eek &s;ome other el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>WHEN the afore&s;aid exploits were done by the In|dians about <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> &s;everal of the Engli&s;h removed
<PB N="251" REF="014120_0281_0F9302451CB26F80">to <HI>Jewel</HI>'s i&s;land, where they hoped to be more &s;ecure from the Indians, but the barbarous enemy finding &s;o little re&s;i&s;tance made again&s;t them on the main land, a con&s;iderable party of them came with their canoes to de&s;troy that i&s;land al&s;o, about three weeks after the a|forementioned mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>THERE was a fortified hou&s;e upon the &s;aid i&s;land, where the Engli&s;h that either kept upon the i&s;land, or repaired thither, hoped to &s;ecure them&s;elves. But at the time the Indians a&s;&s;aulted the place, many of the Engli&s;h were ab&s;ent, and few left in the garri&s;on but women and children. Some were gone to other places to fetch Indian corn, others were in a boat employed about fi&s;h, among&s;t whom was one <HI>Richard Pots</HI> with two more. The wife of the &s;aid <HI>Pots</HI> was wa&s;hing by the water &s;ide, where &s;he was &s;urprized with her child|ren, and carried away in fight of her hu&s;band, who was not a little di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with that &s;ad &s;pectacle, but was incapable of affording any relief either to his wife or children. One of the&s;e little innocents, e&s;pying his father in the boat, ran into the water, calling out for help; but an Indian was running after him to catch him up; the poor man in a great agony, being with|in half a gun &s;hot, was about to fire upon the Indian, but fearing he might wound or perhaps kill his child, which the villian had &s;eized and was carrying off, he forbore, chu&s;ing rather to have him carried away a|live, than expo&s;e him to the lo&s;s of his life or limbs, by &s;hooting at the Indian.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid &s;ome of the Indians were killed by tho&s;e in the garri&s;on; 'tis mentioned that a lad at one &s;hot killed two or three of them; &s;ome guns were found afterwards under the fort, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have belonged to &s;ome of the Indians that were killed. Some that were abroad when the fort was a&s;&s;aulted, de&s;pe|rately broke in through the Indians, whereby at the la&s;t many people were pre&s;erved. Some flying away to <HI>Jewel</HI>'s i&s;land in a cance, to ward <HI>Richmond</HI>'s i&s;land, met with a ketch, to which they made known the di&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="252" REF="014120_0282_0F930246100CDF18">the people were in, who thereupon went to the place and took in all the people they found there, and carried them off to a place of more &s;afety. Yet there were &s;everal per&s;ons &s;aid to be killed and carried away at that time, viz. three men, who were known to be killed, two women and two children, that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be yet alive, though in the enemy's power.</P>
<P>FROM thence they went to <HI>Spurwinks,</HI> where they a&s;&s;aulted one place, or more, and killed one man, wounded another, and carried another away captive. Among&s;t tho&s;e that were in danger of &s;urprizal, one that could not run hid him&s;elf in a garden of cabbages, &s;o that he was not found, yet was very near them, for he overheard &s;everal que&s;tions they a&s;ked him they took; by which means he was the better enabled af|terward to prevent the danger two more were coming into, for the poor fellow they had taken, told them that one <HI>Gendal,</HI> and another man were to come that way by and by; whereupon this man that had hid him&s;elf, meeting <HI>Gendal</HI> and the other man, gave them notice of the danger, whereby they were delivered out of the &s;nare for that time. Not long after Mr. <HI>Gendal</HI> fell into their hands, as &s;hall hereafter be related.

However go they would, and &s;oon after went to <HI>Mountjoy</HI>'s i&s;land to fetch &s;heep, where they landed &s;even men; but the Indians
<PB N="253" REF="014120_0283_0F9302490514C418">&s;uddenly fell upon them, when they betook them&s;elves to the ruins of a &s;tone hou&s;e, where they defended them&s;elves as long as they could; but at la&s;t they were all de&s;troyed either with &s;tones ca&s;t in upon them, or with the enemies &s;hot, except one, who, though at the fir&s;t it was hoped his wounds were not mortal, yet &s;oon after died thereof. Among&s;t the&s;e was one <HI>George Felt,</HI> much lamented, who had been more active than any man in tho&s;e parts again&s;t the Indians, but at la&s;t he lo&s;t his own life among&s;t them, in this too de&s;perate an adventure.</P>
<P>THE Indians growing more bold by the&s;e attempts in tho&s;e remote places, drew down nearer towards <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> for not long after a party of them came upon <HI>Cape Nidduck,</HI> where they killed and carried away all the inhabitants of a few &s;cattering hou&s;es, to the number of &s;even in all; and &s;uch was their &s;avage cruelty exerci&s;ed in this place, as is not u&s;ually to be heard of, for having da&s;hed out the brains of a poor woman that gave &s;uck, they nailed the young child to the dead body of its mother, which was found &s;ucking in that awful manner, when the people came to the place. The day before a man and his wife were kill|ed by them at <HI>Wells,</HI> and two more &s;oon after. On the 12th of <HI>October</HI> following, near an 100 of the Indians made an a&s;&s;ault upon <HI>Block-Point,</HI> all the in|habitants being gathered into one fortified place upon that point, which a few hands might have defended again&s;t all the Indians on that &s;ide of the country; but as it &s;eems, one called <HI>Mugg,</HI> was the leader of the Indians, one that had from a child been well ac|quainted with the Engli&s;h, and had lived &s;ome years in Engli&s;h families, who though a cunning fellow, and had &s;ucceeded much in his attempts, yet at this time &s;hewed more courte&s;y to the Engli&s;h, than ac|cording to former outrages could be expected from any of tho&s;e barbarous mi&s;creants, and was willing to make offer of a treaty to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;&s;elin,</HI> Chief of the garri&s;on, to whom the &s;aid <HI>Mugg</HI> promi&s;ed liberty for all that

<P>WHEN people have once been frighted with reports and &s;en&s;e of danger, they are ready to fly away like a hart before the hunter or his hounds; one of the in|habitants of the place affirmed he &s;aw an 150 Indians, which was more by an 100 than any body el&s;e ever &s;aw near the fort. But when a place is con&s;igned to ruin, every thing they take in hand &s;hall tend that way.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of <HI>Black Point</HI> was accompanied with a|nother &s;ad accident that happened about the &s;ame time at <HI>Richmond</HI>'s i&s;land: For young Mr. <HI>Fryer,</HI> with &s;ome others at <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> to whom it &s;eemed grievous that the Indians &s;hould make all that &s;poil in every place in tho&s;e farther plantations, ventured upon the great importunity of Mr. <HI>Gendal,</HI> with a ketch, to try what they could &s;ave of &s;uch things as the Indians had left; but things were &s;o ordered, that before they had loaded their ketch, coming too near the &s;tage head, they pre&s;ently found them&s;elves in danger of a &s;orprizal; for part of their company being a&s;hore, were &s;eized by the Indians, or in danger thereof, whom they were not willing to leave behind; and be&s;ides the wind blowing in hard upon them, they could not get out of the har|bour, but were forced to abide the danger of an a&s;&s;ault; the Indians getting many of them into the &s;tage head, annoyed them &s;o fa&s;t with their &s;hot, that not a man of them was able to look above deck, but he was in danger of being &s;hot down; among&s;t the re&s;t Mr. <HI>James Fryer</HI> venturing too much in view of the ene|my, received a wound in his knee, which appeared not dangerous at fir&s;t, but for want of bover looking to, than could be found among&s;t that black regiment, in|to
<PB N="255" REF="014120_0285_0F93024A5DA17EB8">who&s;e hands he &s;oon after fell, it proved mortal unto him within a &s;ew days after; he being by a &s;trange accident brought home to his father's hou&s;e, at the great i&s;land in <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> Mr. <HI>Fryer</HI> being thus wounded, the re&s;t of the company defended them&s;elves for a while, with much courage and re&s;olution, till they were brought to the &s;ad choice of falling into the hands of one of the&s;e three bad ma&s;ters, the fire, the water, or the barbarous heathen, to whom at la&s;t they thought it be&s;t to yield, in hopes of liberty afterwards, at lea&s;t of lengthening out their lives a little longer, for the Indians had manned out a canoe with &s;everal hands to cut their cable, and others &s;tood ready within the de|fence of the &s;tage head, to fire upon any one that &s;tir|ed in the ketch, by which means the ve&s;&s;el after the cable was cut, &s;oon drove a&s;hore; and then it was threatened to be pre&s;ently burnt, if they did not all yield, to which they all at la&s;t con&s;ented.</P>
<P>THE Indians how barbarous &s;oever in their own nature, yet civilly treated their pri&s;oners, and upon farther di&s;cour&s;e &s;ent one or two of them to <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> to give them there an opportunity to ran&s;om their friends. The per&s;ons &s;ent home to procure a ran&s;om, were to return with &s;uch a quantity of goods as the Indians had de&s;ired, by &s;uch a preci&s;e time; but they that brought the things for their ran&s;om, coming a day or two before the time, when tho&s;e that &s;ent them were gone up the river at <HI>Black-Point,</HI> and not return|ed: Some other Indians waiting for &s;uch an opportu|nity, &s;eized the goods, at lea&s;t that part which they mo&s;t de&s;ired, and through mi&s;take, killing one of the three men that brought them, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the other two, without return of the pri&s;oners as was expected.</P>
<P>AS to what happened afterwards, we are yet much in the dark, and for the pre&s;ent can write but by gue&s;s: For within a few days after the return of Mr. <HI>Gendal,</HI> and the other man that went to carry the ran&s;om, before the 1&s;t of <HI>November, Mugg</HI> him&s;elf came to <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> bringing Mr. <HI>James Fryer,</HI> who &s;oon after
<PB N="256" REF="014120_0286_0F93024B37982998">died of his wound; one of the pri&s;oners along with him complaining that without his knowledge &s;ome of the Indians had &s;eized what was &s;ent for the ran&s;om of the re&s;t, promi&s;ing upon his faith, that he would make good his word for the &s;ending home all the pri&s;oners, and offered al&s;o in the name of the other Indians to confirm a new peace with the Engli&s;h for the future. The Major General of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> colony was then at <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> but not willing to tran&s;act a matter of that nature and moment by his &s;ole authority, or|dered the &s;aid <HI>Mugg</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the chief leader of the Indians) to be carried down to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to the Governor and Council there, to conclude the bu&s;ine&s;s, with whom he &s;oon after agreed upon a firm peace with the Engli&s;h of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> in the name of <HI>Madockawando,</HI> the Chief of all the Indians in the ea&s;tern parts about <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> engaging al&s;o to remain him&s;elf as ho&s;tage, aboard the ve&s;&s;el (in which he was &s;ent home from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the 21&s;t of <HI>November</HI> following) until the pri&s;oners (which are &s;aid to be 50 or 60, that they have &s;till in their hands) be &s;ent home, and the re&s;t of the articles performed; the i&s;&s;ue of which we as yet wait to hear in God's good time, this 12th day of <HI>December</HI> following, 1676, when they there have made an end of the reckoning, it is hoped we may have our right again.</P>
<P>THERE are two principal actors among&s;t the Indians that have all along promoted the&s;e de&s;igns among&s;t them, one named <HI>Squando,</HI> Sagamore of <HI>Saco,</HI> and the aforementioned <HI>Madockawando,</HI> the chief commander of the Indians ea&s;tward about <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> who are &s;aid to be, by them that know them, a &s;trange kind of moralized &s;avages; grave and &s;erious in their &s;peech and carriage, and not without &s;ome &s;hew of a kind of religion, which no doubt but they have learned from the Prince of Darkne&s;s (by the help of &s;ome Papi&s;t in tho&s;e parts) that can <HI>transform him&s;elf into an Angel of light;</HI> under that &s;hape, the better to carry on the de|&s;igns of his kingdom. It is &s;aid al&s;o, they pretend to have received &s;ome vi&s;ions and revelations, by which
<PB N="257" REF="014120_0287_0F93024C0D41B8F8">they have been commanded to wor&s;hip the great God, and not to work on the Lord's day. We know where that fountain hath its ri&s;e, that &s;endeth forth at the &s;ame place &s;weet and bitter waters; and from whence their hearts are in&s;pired, that join ble&s;&s;ing of God, with cur&s;ing and killing his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>IT is reported by &s;ome that came lately from tho&s;e parts, that the Indians there do as yet refu&s;e to have any peace with the Engli&s;h, and will not as yet return any of our captive friends, till God &s;peak to the afore|&s;aid enthu&s;ia&s;ts, that are their leaders, that they &s;hould no longer make war with us, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT not to trouble our&s;elves farther with tho&s;e mini&s;ters of Satan, or tho&s;e that are actuated by the Angel of the bottomle&s;s pit, who po&s;&s;ibly &s;ince their delu&s;ions are but two &s;old more the children of Hell than they were before. We know better how to un|der&s;tand the mind of the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, than to depend on &s;uch lying oracles.</P>
<P>THAT God who hath at pre&s;ent turned their hearts to hate his people, and deal &s;ubtilly with his &s;ervants, we hope in time, will either turn the &s;tream, and cau&s;e them to deal friendly and &s;incerely with his people as heretofore, or give us an opportunity to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>IN the next place it remains, that &s;ome account be given of our forces under Capt. <HI>Hathorne,</HI> and of their &s;everal expeditions into the ea&s;tern parts, &s;ince the middle of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t; fir&s;t up toward <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> by the &s;ea-&s;ide, then afterwards through the woods, direct|ly northward, toward <HI>O&s;&s;apy</HI> and <HI>Pigwauchet,</HI> in hopes to have found the enemy there at their head|quarters.</P>
<P>UPON the fir&s;t report of tho&s;e deva&s;tations and &s;poils that had been made by fire and &s;word in tho&s;e ea&s;tern plantations, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end &s;ome forces that way to put a &s;top to the current of
<PB N="258" REF="014120_0288_0F93024CC35C7558">tho&s;e outrages, before the remainder of the &s;outhern Indians could have an opportunity to join with them: To that end about an 130 Engli&s;h, with 40 Indians, were di&s;patched away into tho&s;e parts, under the com|mand of Capt. <HI>William Hathorne,</HI> Capt. <HI>Sill.</HI> and Capt. <HI>Hunting,</HI> who were to join with &s;uch as could be rai&s;ed in tho&s;e parts, under Major <HI>Waldern</HI> and Capt. <HI>Fro&s;t.</HI> After they had &s;urprized the Indians that flock|ed into tho&s;e parts, (as was related before) which was done upon the 6th of <HI>September,</HI> 1676, Capt. <HI>Hath|borne,</HI> who was commander in chief, marched the for|ces by the &s;ea-&s;ide, towards <HI>Ca&s;co;</HI> For at that time they were upon &s;ome demure, whether to march di|&s;ectly toward <HI>O&s;&s;apy</HI> and <HI>Pigwauchet,</HI> where the head-quarters of the enemy was &s;uppo&s;ed to be, or el&s;e to march directly toward <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> where they heard parties of he enemy were daily &s;poiling the plantations of the Engli&s;h; at the la&s;t it was judged mo&s;t expedient to try if they could not meet with &s;ome parties of the enemy among&s;t tho&s;e plantations near the &s;ea &s;ide, by that means at lea&s;t to prevent them from doing more mi&s;chief, if they could not find an opportunity to fall upon &s;ome of them and de&s;troy them; but their time was not yet come, nor were all the de&s;olations as yet accompli&s;hed, which God had a purpo&s;e to bring about by their means: For notwith&s;tanding there was a &s;ufficient force to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the numbers of the enemy, if they had been many more than they were, yet being emboldened and grown &s;ubtle by their former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, they had &s;o di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves all about the woods in tho&s;e parts, that when our for|ces were in one place, they would be in another, and &s;o did much mi&s;chief thereabouts, while our &s;oldiers were out after them: For after they had by &s;everal &s;tops in ten days time got to <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> from <HI>Newechewannick</HI> (about the 8th of <HI>September</HI>) they marched to <HI>Wells,</HI> and from <HI>Wells</HI> to <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> and &s;o from whence to <HI>Black-Point</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed by water, and then arrived at <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> about the 20th of <HI>September;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et about that very time were &s;everal of the Engli&s;h cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> off at <HI>Mountjoy</HI>'s i&s;land, and that in &s;ight of our forces, when
<PB N="259" REF="014120_0289_0F93024D860628F8">they were not able to come at them for want of boats, the i&s;land lying two leagues off in the bay; this hap|pened the 23d of the &s;ame month, as was &s;aid before; and within two days after, another party of the enemy were doing mi&s;chief at <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Cape-Nidduck,</HI> and yet e&s;caped away when they had done.</P>
<P>NOR could our forces in all their expedition meet with any of them, but two; one of which &s;oon after he was taken, was let go by the treachery or carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s of them that held him. For when our forces were come within a few miles of the hither &s;ide of <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> &s;ome of our <HI>Natick</HI> Indian &s;couts going in company with the Indians under <HI>Blind Will</HI> (a Saga|more of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> who went in company with 8 of his men, &s;uppo&s;ed to be good pilots for the places more ea&s;tward) met with &s;ome of the enemy, and laid hold of a couple of them; ju&s;tice was done to one of them; the other, although he was led by two of <HI>Blind Will</HI>'s Indians, they made &s;hift to let go, who e&s;cap|ing, got over a river, and gave notice to the Indians who were on the other &s;ide, and were heard but a lit|tle before thre&s;hing in a barn that belonged to one <HI>Anthony Bracket,</HI> whom they had lately &s;urprized, Another di&s;appointment our forces met with about the &s;ame time; for when Capt. <HI>Hathorne</HI> was up at <HI>Ca&s;co Bay</HI> with his &s;oldiers, he never could come up with the Indians, either through want of &s;kill in them that were his &s;couts, or rather want of faithfulne&s;s in one that &s;hould have been his guide, who had got his living by trading with the Indians, therefore &s;eemed unwilling to have the brood of them de&s;troyed, as was known after|wards; and by that means a party of the enemy e&s;|caped the hands of our &s;oldiers. Yet it plea&s;ed God at one time to bring the forlorn of our forces upon a party of the enemy, who e&s;pying the Engli&s;h, pre&s;ently fled away into the woods like &s;o many wild dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; yet one of them, viz <HI>J. Sanp&s;on,</HI> who had been of the com|pany that killed <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> the year before, was by the &s;pecial hand of Divine ju&s;tice, &s;uffered to fell by &s;ome of our forces; he was a very lu&s;ty, &s;tout man, and one
<PB N="260" REF="014120_0290_0F93024E1D4DC520">that was armed with &s;everal forts of weapons, but there is no weapon &s;hall defend them whom death hath a commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy; there is no ran&s;om in that war. The re&s;t of the Indians that were &s;cattered about <HI>Ca&s;co Bay,</HI> having di&s;covered our forces, made their e&s;cape; but we hope their time is &s;hort, and that God will find &s;ome way to cut off the bloody and deceitful enemies of his people, and not &s;uffer them to live out half their days.</P>
<P>BUT by one &s;uch accident or other, our &s;oldiers could not meet with any of them that had done the mi&s;chief about tho&s;e parts. While our forces lay a|bout <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> a &s;mall party of the enemy came down upon the borders of the town of <HI>Wells,</HI> where they lay in ambu&s;h near a garri&s;on hou&s;e at one end of the town, and &s;hot Mr. <HI>JamesGouge</HI> from his hor&s;e, on Lord's-day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 24th, as he was going home from the meeting, and then knocked down his wife, giving her &s;everal wounds with their hatchers about the head, or which &s;he died in three days after.</P>
<P>THE next day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25th, the &s;ame party, being not more than &s;even in number, went toward <HI>York,</HI> and &s;urprized <HI>Cape-Nidduck</HI> in a mo&s;t barbarous manner, killing mo&s;t of the poor people belonging thereunto. Some of their neighbors hearing the guns, came to their re&s;cue; the Indians being on the further &s;ide of a river, dared them to come over and fight with them man to man, u&s;ing many reproachful expre&s;&s;ions, and making a &s;hot at them, which &s;ome of the company not being able to bear, did very re&s;olutely adventure through the river after them; but they were not wil|ling to try the valour of the Engli&s;h, when they per|ceived they found a way to pa&s;s over the river upon them, but returned back towards <HI>Wells,</HI> where they killed one <HI>George Farrow, Sept.</HI> 27th, as he was too carele&s;sly venturing to his hou&s;e without any company. The&s;e things happened while our forces were at <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> where they tarried &s;even or eight days; and bearing of the&s;e outrages committed in &s;ome of tho&s;e places
<PB N="261" REF="014120_0291_0F93024EDB40C2C8">which they left behind them, and not being able to meet with any of them in the place where they were, they returned back towards <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>York;</HI> but the Indians were e&s;caped away into the woods after their companions, before they came there. Our &s;oldiers having thus &s;pent much time and pains in a fruitle&s;s expedition towards <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> re&s;olved to venture another march after them up towards <HI>O&s;&s;apy,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing they might by that time be drawn homewards toward their winter quarters; or el&s;e that they might de&s;troy what they had left behind them, to prevent their harbouring there for the future: But it &s;eemed good to him, who by his &s;overeign power and infinite wi&s;dom ordereth all events and purpo&s;es (wherein his people or others are concerned) to di&s;appoint all endeavors u&s;ed at that time for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the enemy, or putting any &s;top to their wonted &s;ucce&s;&s;es; for &s;oon after our forces were returned back from <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> news was brought of the &s;urprizal of <HI>Black-Point,</HI> on the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> as was mentioned before; which notwith&s;tanding, it was judged more advi&s;eable to venture and proceed on with the expedition toward <HI>O&s;&s;apy,</HI> (whither it was &s;uppo&s;ed by this time the greate&s;t number of them were retired) rather than to return back again to recover <HI>Black-Point,</HI> where was nothing to be expected but an empty fort, and &s;ome de&s;erted hou&s;es, which it &s;eems the Indians had for&s;aken by that time. And be&s;ides, that other forces were about the &s;ame time ordered to repair thi|ther, &s;ufficient for the repairing and &s;ecuring the place with what el&s;e was left remaining from the hands of the enemy: And likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;oldiers were ordered to garri&s;on the towns thereabouts, to prevent them from making any further a&s;&s;ault upon them. However, they were &s;o far emboldened by the taking of <HI>Black-Point,</HI> and the ketch at <HI>Richmond</HI> i&s;land, that a party of them came the very next week after, toward <HI>Wells,</HI> hoping to attain that, and all the towns and places between <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> as they had done <HI>Black-Point:</HI> For a party of them under <HI>Mugg</HI> their chief leader, brought Mr. <HI>Gendal</HI> along with them to <HI>Wells,</HI> where they &s;ummoned the fir&s;t garri&s;on at the town's
<PB N="262" REF="014120_0292_0F930250D13BBE40">end. To facilitate the bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;ent the &s;aid <HI>Gendal</HI> as their agent or me&s;&s;enger to move them' &s;o &s;urrender without hazarding an on&s;et; but the people were not &s;o de&s;pondent as to yield up the place upon &s;o &s;light an occa&s;ion; which when the enemy di&s;cern|ed, they &s;oon drew off, after they had done &s;ome little mi&s;chief to the inhabitants; for fir&s;t they killed <HI>I&s;aac Littlefield,</HI> not far from the garri&s;on; it is &s;aid they would willingly have had him yield him&s;elf pri&s;oner, but he refu&s;ing, they &s;hot him down, yet they were &s;o civil as to &s;uffer his friends to fetch away his body, without offering any further act of inhumanity to it, or ho&s;tility towards tho&s;e that carried it off.</P>
<P>AN old man called <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> was likewi&s;e killed by them about the &s;ame time; and another who&s;e name was <HI>Jo&s;eph Bigford,</HI> belonging to the garri&s;on, was &s;o badly wounded that he died very &s;oon after. Thirteen head of next cattle were al&s;o killed by them, out of which (through ha&s;te) they only took the tongues, leaving the bodies whole to the owners, unle&s;s it was the leg of one of them, which was al&s;o taken away.</P>
<P>THIS was all the mi&s;chief done by them after the taking of <HI>Black-Point.</HI> The inhabitants of <HI>Winter-Harbour,</HI> near adjoining thereto, being alarmed with the &s;urprizal of the other place, fled away with their goods for a time, until they heard the enemy were moved farther ea&s;tward, and then it is &s;aid they return|ed to their place again. In this po&s;ture have things remained ever &s;ince in tho&s;e ea&s;tera plantations be|tween <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our forces under the command of Captain <HI>Hathorne</HI> and Capt. <HI>Sill,</HI> having at la&s;t obtained all things nece&s;&s;ary for a winter march into the woods, did upon the fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> following, &s;et out to|wards <HI>O&s;&s;apy,</HI> where, after four days march of a very difficult way, over many rivers, not ea&s;y to pa&s;s at that time of the year, they arrived; but found not an In|dian either there, or in the way as they marched along.
<PB N="263" REF="014120_0293_0F93025128142990">The Indians belonging to tho&s;e parts had not many years before, hired &s;ome Engli&s;h traders to build them a fort for their &s;ecurity again&s;t the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which was built very &s;trong for that purpo&s;e, fourteen foot high, with flankers at each corner; but at this time the &s;oldiers intending to di&s;appoint them of their re|fuge, made fuel thereof, which at that time was very needful for our people, who had marched many miles through deep &s;now in a very cold &s;ea&s;on, when they could hardly keep them&s;elves from freezing as they pa&s;&s;ed along, &s;o early in the winter. None of the e|nemy being to be found there in their &s;tronge&s;t fort, it was not counted worth while for all the company to march any further; wherefore a &s;mall party being &s;ent up eighteen or twenty miles farther northward among&s;t the woods, where as they pa&s;&s;ed along they met with many va&s;t lakes, (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of the &s;harpne&s;s of the cold in that &s;ide of the country) ma|king the place &s;carce habitable for any be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;avages that u&s;ed to hunt thereabouts for moo&s;e in the winter, and beaver in the &s;ummer. But at this time it is &s;uppo&s;ed they were all gone lower toward the &s;ea &s;ide, to &s;hare the &s;poils of the Engli&s;h plantations late|ly &s;urprized by them, which is all the reward they have met with, who in former years for the &s;ake of a little lucre by traffic with them, have run them&s;elves there into the very jaws of de&s;truction, either by irre|gular dealing with them, or by their too much confi|dence in their deceitful friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>THERE was great probability that the de&s;ign might have had &s;ome good effect if <HI>Mugg</HI> did not much abu&s;e tho&s;e he fled unto, with a proffer of peace; for he told them that there were about an hundred of them about <HI>O&s;&s;apy</HI> not many days before. But it becomes us to
<PB N="264" REF="014120_0294_0F930251D9608948">look beyond &s;econd cau&s;es in events of this nature, and conclude that God had rai&s;ed up the&s;e barbarous ene|mies to bring a like cha&s;ti&s;ement upon the Engli&s;h in this &s;ide of the country, with that which others had en|dured el&s;ewhere in the end of the former and begin|ning of the pre&s;ent year.</P>

<P>The &s;aid <HI>Mugg</HI> lifted up his hand to heaven for the true performance thereof, e&s;teemed among&s;t them a &s;trong obligation to perform what they promi&s;e.</P>
<P>THINGS were &s;o ordered by the good Providence of God, that the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els arrived &s;afely at <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> in the beginning of the next month, where they &s;ound the &s;aid <HI>Madockawando,</HI> who was ready to confirm and make good the articles of the peace concluded at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> by his agent in his name; and was willing al&s;o to de|liver all the pri&s;oners that were then in his power, or under his command, which were but eleven, who were taken in the ve&s;&s;el at <HI>Richmond</HI>'s i&s;land, the 12th of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t. The &s;aid <HI>Mugg</HI> likewi&s;e being &s;en&s;ible of the obligation he lay under to make his word good, did venture to go up him&s;elf to another plantation of the Indians, where was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome more of the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners were, to &s;ee whether he could obtain their relea&s;e, as al&s;o to per&s;uade the re&s;t of the Indians thereabouts to join in the confirmation of the peace: It appeared to the per&s;ons belonging to the ve&s;&s;els, that the &s;aid <HI>Mugg</HI> went with &s;ome reluctancy, as feating the Indians he was going among&s;t, would either kill him, or keep him pri&s;oner; to which end, he order|ed
<PB N="267" REF="014120_0297_0F93025454B0D448">the commanders belonging to the ve&s;&s;els, to tarry for him about three days, or four at the mo&s;t, a&s;&s;uring them, that if he did not return by that time, they might certainly conclude that either his life or liberty was taken from him; however, the ve&s;&s;els tarried about or near a week beyond the time limited, in ex|pectation of his coming; but after &s;o long &s;tay, they neither &s;eeing nor hearing from him, were ready to fear the wor&s;t, viz. that his countrymen had made him &s;ure, from having more to do with the Engli&s;h; whereupon for fear of being &s;hut up by the &s;harpne&s;s of the winter from returning them&s;elves, they rook the opportunity of the next fair wind, of &s;etting &s;ail for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> (only turning into <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> to &s;ee if they could hear any farther news there) where they arrived with &s;uch pri&s;oners as were freely delivered by <HI>Ma|dockawando,</HI> the 25th of <HI>December</HI> following, anne 1676; among&s;t which pri&s;oners, be&s;ides the two afore|mentioned, who were found at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> there was a third, by a more remarkable Providence than ordinary, added unto them, Mr. <HI>Thomas Cobbet,</HI> &s;on of that re|verend and worthy mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, Mr. <HI>Thomas Cobbet,</HI> pa&s;tor of the church at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> a town with|in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> juri&s;diction, who had all the time of his &s;on's captivity, together with his friends, wre&s;t|led with God in their daily prayers for his relea&s;e, and accordingly he was with the more joy received by his friends, as an an&s;wer and return of their prayers. The &s;aid young man had lived with Mr. <HI>Fryer,</HI> mer|chant, of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> for &s;ome years before, and had been often at &s;ea with Mr. <HI>James Fryer,</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on of the &s;aid merchant, and who had after much expe|rience of his faithfulne&s;s, dexterity, and courage on all &s;uch accounts, borne him &s;o much re&s;pect, that when he was urged by his father to go along with Mr. <HI>Gen|dal,</HI> as was &s;aid before, he would not venture unle&s;s his friend <HI>Thomas Cobbet,</HI> would go along with him; which &s;ervice he only for his friends &s;ake accepted, which proved a fatal adventure to Mr. <HI>James Fryer,</HI> and might have been to the other al&s;o, had not God otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of him, having, as is hoped, more
<PB N="268" REF="014120_0298_0F93025766D8BF78">&s;ervice for him in the land of the living. Among&s;t all the pri&s;oners at that time taken, the &s;aid <HI>Thomas Cob|bet</HI> &s;eemed to have had the harde&s;t portion; for be&s;ide; the de&s;perate dangers that he e&s;caped, before he was taken, fir&s;t by a bullet &s;hot through his wai&s;tcoat, &s;econdly by a drunken Indian, who had a knife at his throat to cut it, when his hands were bound, when the Indians came to &s;hare the pri&s;oners among&s;t them, he fell into the hands of one of the ruggede&s;t fellow, by whom within a &s;ew days after his &s;urprizal, he was carried fir&s;t from <HI>Black-Point</HI> to <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> river, in the ketch, which the Indians made to fail in, in the &s;aid river, from whence he was forced to travel with his Pateroon, four or five miles over land, to <HI>Damari&s;cottee,</HI> where he was compelled to row or paddle in a canoe, about fifty miles farther to <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> and there taking leave of all his Engli&s;h friends and acquaintance, at lea&s;t for the winter, he was put to paddle a canoe up fifty or &s;ixty miles farther ea&s;tward, to an i&s;land called <HI>Mount-De&s;ert,</HI> where his Pateroon u&s;ed to keep his win|ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, and to appoint his hunting vovages; and in that de&s;ert-like condition was the poor young man forced to continue nine weeks in the &s;ervice of a &s;a|vage mi&s;creant, who &s;ometimes would tyrannize over him, becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand his language, and for want thereof, might occa&s;ion him to mi&s;s of his game, or the like. Whatever &s;ickne&s;s he was &s;ub|ject to, by chance of diet, or on any other account, he could expect no other allowance than the wigwam will afford: If <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> be in the pri&s;on, &s;o long as God is with him there, he &s;hall be pre&s;erved, and in due time remembered.</P>
<P>AFTER the end of the nine weeks, the Indian whom he was to &s;erve, had &s;pent all his powder, whereupon on a &s;udden he took up a re&s;olution to &s;end this young man down to <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> to Mr. <HI>Ca&s;teen,</HI> to procure more pow|der to kill moo&s;e and deer, which it &s;eems is all their way of living at <HI>Mount-De&s;ert;</HI> the Indian was certain|ly over-ruled by Divine Providence, in &s;ending his captive down thither, for a few days before, as it &s;eems,
<PB N="269" REF="014120_0299_0F93025877E60348">after the Indians in that place had been powawing together. he told him, that there were two Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els then come into <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> or <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> which indeed proved &s;o; yet was it not minded by him &s;ure|ly when he &s;ent his captive thither for powder, for it proved the means of his e&s;cape, which his Pateroon might ea&s;ily have conjectured, if it had not been hid from him. As &s;oon as he arrived at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> he met with <HI>Mugg,</HI> who pre&s;ently &s;aluted him by the name of Mr. <HI>Cobbet,</HI> and taking him by the hand, told him he had been at his father's hou&s;e (which was the 1&s;t or 2d of <HI>November</HI> before, as he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) and had promi&s;ed to &s;end him home, as &s;oon as he returned. <HI>Madockawando</HI> taking notice of what <HI>Mugg</HI> was &s;peaking that way, although he was will|ing that he &s;hould be relea&s;ed according to agreement (his Pateroon being one of this Sagamore's &s;ubjects, though during the hunting voyage of the winter, he lived at &s;uch a di&s;tance from him) began to demand &s;omething for &s;atisfaction, in a way of ran&s;om, not under&s;tanding before that his father was a great preach|man, as they u&s;e to call it: Reply was made him, that he &s;hould have &s;omething in lieu of a ran&s;om, viz. a fine coat, which they had for him on board the ve&s;&s;el; which the Sagamore de&s;ired to &s;ee, before he would ab&s;olutely grant a relea&s;e; but upon &s;ight of the &s;aid coat he &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied, and gave him free liberty to return home. Whil&s;t this Mr. <HI>Thomas Cobbet</HI> was a pri&s;oner at <HI>Mount-De&s;ert,</HI> going along with the Indians to hunt on an extream cold day, he was &s;o overcome with the &s;harpne&s;s thereof, that all his &s;en&s;es whore &s;uddenly benummed, &s;o that he fell down upon the &s;now, not being able to &s;tir hand or foot, and had without doubt there peri&s;hed in a little time, but the Indians he was going along with, mi&s;&s;ing him, pre&s;ently ran about the woods to &s;eck him, and when they &s;ound him, they were either &s;o pitiful to him, or &s;o careful of their own good, as not to ca&s;t away a likely young man, from whom they expected either much &s;ervice, or a good ran&s;om, for
<PB N="270" REF="014120_0300_0F930258B3914758">want of a little care and pains to pre&s;erve his life; wherefore taking him upon their &s;houlders, they car|ried him into the next wigwam, &s;o that he &s;oon after revived, and came to him&s;elf again, without any far|ther mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>AT another time, the &s;avage villian, who&s;e pri&s;oner he was, &s;o long as he had &s;trong liquor, for five days together was &s;o drunk the he was like a furious mad bea&s;t, &s;o that none dur&s;t come near him, his &s;quaws he almo&s;t killed in one of tho&s;e drunken fits.</P>
<P>THE &s;aid <HI>Thomas</HI> was forced to get out of his fight into the woods all that night, for fear of being injured by him; where making a fire, he kept him&s;elf alive; the &s;quaws being by God's &s;pecial Providence &s;o inclin|ed to pity, that they came to him daily with victuals, by which means he was at that time al&s;o pre&s;erved; all which put together, makes his deliverance the more remarkable, as an an&s;wer of prayer.</P>
<P>AS for the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners (which are &s;aid to be 50 or 60) they were left with tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;urprized them at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> and <HI>Seep&s;cot</HI> river: The women are employed it &s;eems to &s;ew, and make garments for them; they having plundered many Engli&s;h goods at <HI>Arow&s;ick.</HI> They are &s;o much elated with their late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in &s;poiling &s;o many Engli&s;h habitations, that they &s;eem not very ready to hearken to terms of peace, as their Sagamore <HI>Madockawando</HI> doth de&s;ire: Nor are the Engli&s;h able to come near them with any of their forces this winter &s;ea&s;on, in regard both of the remotene&s;s of the place, and &s;harpne&s;s of the cold, which u&s;ed to be extream in tho&s;e parts. How their hearts may be inclined in the following year, or what the Engli&s;h may be enabled to do again&s;t them, is known unto God only, on whom we de&s;ire to wait for a comfortable i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e our troubles. But until they have &s;pent all the plunder that is taken, it is no doubt, but they will &s;eem aver&s;e from having peace; 20 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ers to the we&s;tward did, who&s;e hearts were hard|ened
<PB N="271" REF="014120_0301_0F9302596D6B0B70">again&s;t all proffers of that uature, till they were de&s;troyed; po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome remnants of them that e&s;|caped in tho&s;e other parts, are got hither among&s;t the&s;e, and do animate them all they can to ho&s;tility again&s;t us, till they make the&s;e as mi&s;erable as them|&s;elves, and &s;o forced at the la&s;t to fly their country. Many have been the troubles we have met with from the&s;e our barbarous neighbours round about us, but <HI>God we tru&s;t will deliver us out of them all,</HI> as he hath promi&s;ed to do for the righteous, who may in the dark|e&s;t night of affliction &s;ay, <HI>light is &s;own for them,</HI> which &s;hall &s;pring up in the appointed time thereof.</P>
<P>NO farther news came to hand concerning the En|gli&s;h pri&s;oners at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> after the return of Capt. <HI>Moor</HI> from <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> till the 5th of <HI>January;</HI> when one <HI>Francis Card</HI> with another young man, formerly an inhabitant of &s;ome place about <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> or of <HI>A|row&s;ick</HI> (but then a pri&s;oner with the Indians) made an e&s;cape from them, and got over to <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> and then to <HI>Black-Point,</HI> from thence he was conveyed to <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> &s;oon after, and then to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>THE manner of his e&s;cape, as he reports was this: He was employed by the Indians to thre&s;h corn at a barn a little lower in the river, than the place where the Indians commonly kept; being tru&s;ted alone, to go and come of him&s;elf, becau&s;e there was no &s;u&s;picion of any coming to carry him away, or &s;eeming po&s;|&s;ibility to get away without being di&s;covered, he found means to plot with another young man, who was &s;ent to look hor&s;es; who&s;e fle&s;h it &s;eems is by tho&s;e wild &s;avages, preferred before the be&s;t beef, &s;o that having their choice of both, they took what they liked be&s;t. This being the employment of the young man, he had the better opportunity when he was in the woods to make a contrivance to get away. Thus being re&s;olved upon their de&s;ign, they provided ne|ce&s;&s;aries accordingly, and &s;ent &s;uch a me&s;&s;age home to their ma&s;ters, as might occa&s;ion them not to expect them very &s;oon that night. Thus re&s;olved, they
<PB N="272" REF="014120_0302_0F93025A201D0608">marched away as &s;oon as they perceived the coa&s;t was clear; and having provided a canoe accordingly fit for the de&s;ign, by the help of which they got over the water, by which they were to pa&s;s, which was not frozen; and in the night time turned into a &s;wamp, where they might make a fire to keep them from &s;uf|fering with the cold, without being di&s;cerned; &s;o that within two or three days they recovered the fort and garri&s;on at <HI>Black-Point,</HI> from whence they were &s;oon conveyed to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Francis Card</HI> made this relation of matters when he came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> viz. that the pri&s;oners which he left behind were well, and not much ill u&s;ed, only put to do the &s;ervile work about the Indians. Woe mu&s;t it needs be with chri&s;tians, when put not only to &s;o|journ, but to &s;erve in tho&s;e tents of <HI>Kedar.</HI> Such of the women as were &s;killed in knitting and &s;ewing, were improved to make &s;tockings and garments for their Pateroons: So it &s;eems the ware-hou&s;e at <HI>Arow|&s;ick</HI> furni&s;hed them with cloth, &s;tuff, and linnen, and the inhabitants &s;erved for artificers to cut it out, and make it up.</P>
<P>HE reported al&s;o that the Indians &s;pake nothing of any peace; but rather being heightened with their late and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, were contriving how to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other places in the hands of the En|gli&s;h on that &s;ide of the country, which God forbid &s;hould ever come to pa&s;s; but finding &s;o ea&s;y work of their former exploits, they hope to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es with the like facility in all other places where they come.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems <HI>Squando</HI> is their chief leader, that enthu&s;ia&s;|tical, or rather diabolical mi&s;creant; who hath put on a garb of religion, and orders his people to do the like; performing religious wor&s;hip among&s;t the Indians <HI>in his way,</HI> yet is &s;uppo&s;ed to have very familiar conver&s;e with the devil, that appears to him as an Angel of light in &s;ome &s;hape or other very frequently. This
<PB N="273" REF="014120_0303_0F93025AD9AC4018"><HI>Francis Card</HI> al&s;o affirmeth, that there is not &s;o great a number of the Indians as is here reported; for he faith, when they were going out upon &s;ome de&s;ign, while he was in their hands, he had an opportunity to count them all, and could find but 98 of them that were men; neither could he di&s;cern that there were any of the we&s;tern Indians, unle&s;s <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Andrew,</HI> that formerly e&s;caped out of <HI>Dover</HI> pri&s;on; although it was before apprehended there were multitudes of them &s;tocked thither.</P>
<P>Francis Card's <HI>declaration of their beginning, Augu&s;t</HI> 14th.</P>
<P>THE Indians came to <HI>Richard Hammond</HI>'s, and there killed <HI>Richard Hammond, Samuel Smith, Jo&s;hua Grant,</HI> there parting their company, eleven men came up <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river to my hou&s;e, and there took me, and my family. Therefore the re&s;t of their company went to <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> and there took the garri&s;on: About a fortnight after they came down <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river, and &s;o went down to <HI>Damaril</HI>'s <HI>Cove,</HI> and there burnt hou&s;es, and killed cattle; then coming back parted their company; one party went to <HI>Jewel</HI>'s i&s;land, and the other party went to <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> being in num|ber 81. Tho&s;e that went to <HI>Sagadahock</HI> took a &s;hal|lop; from thence came to <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river, and then went to killing and de&s;troying of cattle and hou&s;es; for they had intelligence of a ketch and a &s;hallop at <HI>Damaril</HI>'s <HI>Cove,</HI> and going there they took the &s;hallop, and killed two men, being in number about 80. The next day made up their forces, went out to <HI>Black-Point,</HI> being about an 100 fighting men, and are now in two forts about 60 at a place, with &s;ix or eight wigwams between the two forts.</P>
<P>NOW the be&s;t place to land men is in <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> and in <HI>Kennebeck</HI> river; the one place being eight, the other about fourteen miles from the fort where I was kept; and if the army do not go now with &s;peed, they will be gone forty miles farther up in the country. At the fir&s;t taking of me they carried me up to <HI>Taconet,</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="014120_0304_0F93025B9B5BF7A0">and the men coming down, they brought me and two more men down for fear of our killing their women and children; for they kept their women and children at <HI>Taconet</HI> all the &s;ummer. As &s;oon as the warm wea|ther doth &s;et in, they do intend to go away to <HI>Taconet,</HI> and there to build two forts, for there is their fi&s;hing places, and planting ground. <HI>Squando</HI> doth inform them that God doth &s;peak to him, and doth tell him that God hath left our nation to them to de&s;troy, and the Indians take for truth all that he tells them; becau&s;e they have met with no affront. Now <HI>Mugg</HI> the rogue, being come again to the fort, doth make his brags and laughs at the Engli&s;h, and faith, that he hath found the way to burn <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and doth make laughter at your kind entertainment; they make their brags how they do intend to take ve&s;&s;els, and to go to all the fi&s;hing i&s;lands, and &s;o to drive all the coun|try before them; reckoning to be a great number in the &s;pring. There is a great many Indians at <HI>Ca|nada</HI> that have not been out this &s;ummer, both of <HI>Ken|nebeck</HI> and <HI>Damara&s;coggin,</HI> therefore a great many of the&s;e Indians at <HI>Kennebeck</HI> do intend to go to <HI>Canada</HI> in the &s;pring to them. And they do give gifts both of captives, and of goods to the ea&s;tern Indians, to have them to go out with them; but as yet I do not know what they will do, for <HI>Madockawando</HI> and <HI>Squando</HI> are of &s;everal judgments, and &s;o have parted, and <HI>Madockawando</HI> doth pretend love to the Engli&s;h; they do u&s;e our Engli&s;h captives as civilly as we can expect by &s;uch a people. That this is truth, is decla|red by me, <HI>Francis Card,</HI> the 22d of <HI>January,</HI> 1676.</P>
<P>BY the report which he brings it doth not appear &s;o difficult a matter to make an attempt to recover the place, and de&s;troy them that hold it, as was before apprehended: In&s;omuch as that de&s;ign, that was under debate before the Governor and Council a little before, and was let fall for the pre&s;ent, as a matter not fea&s;ible, hath &s;ince been &s;et a foot with a fre&s;h re&s;olution: And a|nother thing al&s;o occurred about the &s;ame time, which put new life into the &s;aid de&s;ign, viz. an apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="275" REF="014120_0305_0F93025C68EB7AA8">that there were &s;everal of the <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> &s;cattered about in the&s;e woods near <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> who it was fear|ed might join with tho&s;e of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> in the &s;pring, and &s;o come down upon the Engli&s;h plantations, and &s;poil them all that are thereabouts. For &s;oon after <HI>Francis Card</HI> came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;ome of Major <HI>Waldern</HI>'s Indians at <HI>Quechecho,</HI> as they were hunting in the woods chanced to meet with three &s;trange Indians, two of which had guns; but tho&s;e of <HI>Quechecho</HI> were without. The other Indians began to in&s;inuate into them, to &s;ee if they could make way for their acceptance with the Engli&s;h: Tho&s;e Indians that this motion was made unto, in a mo&s;t perfidious manner gave them encou|ragement in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and appointed a place where to meet them the next day, &s;aying they would not have them now go home with them to their wigwams, le&s;t their women and children &s;hould be frighted with the &s;ight of their guns; all which was &s;poken upon a treacherous account, by that means to betray them, for they had neither women nor children at their wig|wams; but not having guns them&s;elves, as the others had, they dur&s;t not then &s;eize upon them. The next day therefore, according to appointment, their gue&s;ts expecting a treaty, and a friendly compliance (yet coming apart, as was ordered the day before to be the more ea&s;ily &s;urprized) arrived at the place appointed; and there pre&s;ently the fir&s;t, being thus treacherou&s;ly brought into the &s;nare, was di&s;patched out of hand. The like was al&s;o done to the &s;econd. The third was not at &s;uch a di&s;tance, but he either di&s;cerned or &s;u&s;|pected what became of his fellows, and therefore made the more ha&s;te to e&s;cape; but his deceitful friends were two quick for him, who &s;hot him down before he could get out of their reach; &s;o that they took him alive, as is &s;aid; but he could not live much longer by rea&s;on of his wounds. The&s;e <HI>Que|checho</HI> Indians cut off the &s;calps of their poor country|men (which is their u&s;ual manner, when it is too far to carry their heads) which being brought to Major <HI>Waldern</HI>'s Indians, they were pre&s;ently di&s;cerned to be <HI>Narrhagan&s;ets</HI> by the cut of their hair. This in&s;tance
<PB N="276" REF="014120_0306_0F93025D18232F18">is a &s;ufficient evidence of the &s;ubtility, guile, and fal&s;hood, natural to all the&s;e Indians, and may &s;atisfy any rational per&s;on, what little tru&s;t there is to be put in their words, promi&s;es, or engagements, though never &s;o &s;olemnly made, farther than they that make them, &s;ee advantage in the keeping and performing, Subtility, malice, and revenge, &s;eems to be as in&s;e|parable from them, as if it were a part of their e&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>WHATEVER hopes may be of their conver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity in after time, there is but little appear|ance of any truth in their hearts at pre&s;ent, where &s;o much of the contrary is &s;o ordinarily breathed out of their mouths.</P>
<P>THESE were the manners of the Gentiles in former times, while they remained children of di&s;obedience, until they were renewed after another image: Nor are the&s;e uncapable &s;ubjects for divine grace to work up|on; yet are there &s;ome natural vices proper to every nation in the world, as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of the Grecians, from the te&s;timony of one of their own poets.</P>
<P>BUT to return. The&s;e things &s;o concurring, and &s;everal gentlemen from about <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> repairing to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;o repre&s;ented the &s;tate of things ea&s;tward before the Governor and Council, that it was appre|hended not only nece&s;&s;ary, but fea&s;ible al&s;o to &s;uppre&s;s the afore&s;aid Indians in tho&s;e parts: Whereupon it was forthwith concluded that an expedition &s;hould be made again&s;t them; to which end 200 &s;oldiers, where|of about 60 were of the <HI>Natick</HI> Indians, who had gi|ven good proof of their valour and faithfulne&s;s to the Engli&s;h; all which were immediately di&s;patched away the fir&s;t week in <HI>February,</HI> by water, under the con|duct of Major <HI>Waldern,</HI> as commander in chief; a per|&s;on well approved for his activity, as well as fidelity and courage in matters of this nature. They had to encounter with rough and contrary winds, and much cold weather the fir&s;t week after their &s;etting out; but having &s;o much experience of the favor and goodne&s;s

<P>UPON the 11th of <HI>February,</HI> two Indian &s;quaws that had run away from Major <HI>Waldern</HI>'s in the begin|ning of winter, out of di&s;content, becau&s;e the hu&s;band of one of them, and &s;ome of the relations of the other were &s;ent away, came back with more wit than they carried away with them, though with le&s;s fle&s;h upon their backs; having wandered up toward <HI>Pigwau|chet,</HI> till they were almo&s;t &s;tarved there. they &s;ay &s;ome Indians were &s;oon by them, pretending they were going to the head of <HI>Connecticut</HI> river, with ho&s;tile in|tents again&s;t the Engli&s;h; but they going away in the manner before de&s;cribed, little heed is to be given &s;o the &s;tories they tell upon their return.</P>
<P>THE 19th of <HI>February</HI> following, <HI>John Abbot,</HI> the ma&s;ter of Mr. <HI>Fryer</HI>'s ketch, taken <HI>October</HI> 12th, at <HI>Black-Point,</HI> came in to the <HI>I&s;le of Shoales,</HI> having made a de&s;perate adventure to e&s;cape. He gave a more probable account of things in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>HE faith they were fir&s;t carried to <HI>Sheep&s;ect</HI> river, where the ve&s;&s;el in which they were taken was moored all the winter; in which time the Indians having &s;pent

After he had got &s;o well rid of them, he contrived how to get clear of the other al&s;o; therefore he per&s;uaded them that the ve&s;&s;el would not ride &s;afely in that place, &s;o that he prevailed with them to let him go to another harbour, called <HI>Damaril</HI>'s <HI>Cove,</HI> two or three leagues more ea&s;tward. In the way as he &s;ailed, he &s;o ordered his &s;teering, that &s;ometimes the waves were ready to overtake the ve&s;&s;el, which put his two Indians into a fright, &s;o as they made all the ha&s;te they could to get a&s;hore, as &s;oon as they came within the harbour, urging him to go along with them; but he pretended a nece&s;&s;ary excu&s;e to &s;tay behind to look after the ve&s;&s;el, but with intent, as &s;oon as he &s;hould &s;ee them a&s;hore, to hoi&s;t &s;ail for &s;ome Engli&s;h harbour, having no body on board with him, but a &s;mall Engli&s;h child about three years old: It &s;eems the Indians had a child or two of their own dead in the ve&s;&s;el, who dying after they began their voyage, they were the forwarder to go a&s;hore with them, for burial: The &s;aid <HI>Abbot</HI> now perceiving he had obtained his purpo&s;e (for he o&s;t re&s;olved on this

<P>WITHIN a few days after <HI>John Abbot</HI> afore&s;aid made his e&s;cape in the ve&s;&s;el, there came an expre&s;s from Maj. <HI>Waldern</HI> (the commander in chief over our for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s &s;ent to <HI>Kennebeck</HI> to &s;ubdue the Indians in tho&s;e parts, and deliver the Engli&s;h captives that have been detain|ed in their hands &s;ince <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t) which giveth this account of their proceeding.</P>

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 18th. We &s;ent this morning our &s;couts out by land, who returning about 8 o'clock, brought word they e&s;pied the tracks of three Indians, and found a birch canoe at <HI>Muckquit,</HI> about four miles off, by which we feared we were di&s;covered; the companies about four o'clock were drawn forth, and ju&s;t begin|ning their march, when we e&s;pied five canoes of the enemy about half a mile off; they landed over again&s;t us on an i&s;land, and hallowed to us, whereby we per|ceived they de&s;ired a treaty; hoping to gain the cap|tives, we &s;ent <HI>John Pain</HI> to them, they promi&s;ed him to bring the captives by morning, and de&s;ired peace. After this <HI>John Pain</HI> was &s;ent again, and &s;tayed a|mong the Indians in the room of <HI>Simon,</HI> who came to the Major. He was que&s;tioned, and an&s;wered as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="014120_0310_0F93026017DF1D50">
Que&s;t. How came you to know we were here?</P>
<P>An&s;w. We continually kept out our &s;couts, and ye&s;terday our Indians left a canoe at <HI>Muckquit,</HI> which this day we mi&s;&s;ed, and perceived the Engli&s;h had taken it, and our men that left the canoe e&s;pied you a great way off at <HI>Portland.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. Why did you break your covenant with me?</P>
<P>An&s;w. <HI>Blind Will</HI> &s;tirred us up to the war here, and &s;aid he would kill you at <HI>Quechecho.

<P>THE Major upon this di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Simon,</HI> and &s;ent for <HI>Squando,</HI> to which <HI>Squando</HI> an&s;wered, he would meet him half way if he would come alone in a birch canoe. To this the Major an&s;wered, he would not venture him&s;elf in one of their leaky canoes, and that if he had no more to &s;ay, the treaty was ended: To this <HI>Squando</HI> an&s;wered, he would be with us again at ten o'clock, and bring the captives.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 19th. Wind north-ea&s;t, the weather thick: About noon we di&s;covered a party of Indians in four|teen canoes about three miles above us in the bay; they landed on a point of land, and burnt one Engli&s;h hou&s;e, and &s;houted to &s;ome of our men that were &s;couts, challenging them to fight: Immediately on the return of our &s;couts we marched again&s;t them as &s;ecretly as we could; upon &s;ight of us they fled; but Capt. <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> came upon them with his whole body before they were half out of gun &s;hot: In this &s;kirm|i&s;h

<P><HI>Simon</HI> met him half way, and an&s;wered, the hou&s;e was fired accidentally without order from <HI>Squando;</HI> that they had &s;ent for the captives who were a great way off, and the foul weather hindred their coming: He que&s;tioned <HI>John Pain</HI> al&s;o why we fought them while we were in treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Pain</HI> an&s;wered, they broke it them&s;elves in not per|forming their promi&s;e, challenging our &s;oldiers to &s;ight; the latter <HI>Simon</HI> denied, and an&s;wered the other as be|fore: <HI>Simon</HI> told him they had two men wounded, and expected &s;atisfaction, but al&s;o promi&s;ed the cap|tives the next day, and &s;o le&s;t us.</P>

<P>THEY alledged that the captives were given them by the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians, and they mu&s;t have &s;ome|thing for keeping them all winter, and therefore were not willing to let them go without a ran&s;om; and as for their canoes, they &s;aid they had them in pre&s;ent &s;ervice, being then bound for <HI>Penob&s;cot.</HI> The price demanded, twelve &s;kins a per&s;on, was yielded to; up|on which they delivered <HI>William Chadburn, John Win|nick,</HI> and <HI>John Worwood,</HI> which were all that they would own, or could be proved they had.</P>
<P>THAT part of the pay which was to be in liquor, was pre&s;ently laid down, the re&s;t was promi&s;ed to be fent in the afternoon. The commanders debated what was farther to be done; one or two of the old <HI>Saga|mores</HI> (who were believed) &s;eemed &s;incere about the peace, profe&s;&s;ed that none of them had any hand in the war, but only &s;ome of their young men, whom they could not rule; but &s;everal of the company affirming they &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;aid Indians at <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> engaged in ho&s;tility again&s;t the Engli&s;h, it was re&s;olved not to en|ter into any league of peace with them, but rather to fight them, or &s;urprize them after they had di&s;patched the bu&s;ine&s;s about the captives.</P>
<P>THIS being determined, the Major with five of his men went on &s;hore, with part of the ran&s;om, the bet|ter to beget a confidence in them, and then to return on board again, and fit his men for further &s;ervice; but if he had not wi&s;ely provided again&s;t all exigen|cies beforehand, he might have been prevented from ever going on board any more, for &s;tepping a&s;ide a rod or two from the place for better circum&s;pection, he e&s;pied the point of a lance from under a board, hid there, as were other arms near by, for a treacherous de&s;ign that was in their minds, &s;oon after, upon the receiving the re&s;t of the pay, to have been put into ex|ecution.
<PB N="285" REF="014120_0315_0F9302679B58B798">Whereupon Major <HI>Waldern</HI> took up the lance and came towards them, charging them with fal&s;hood and treachery, for hiding weapons ju&s;t by, wherewith to de&s;troy them as &s;oon as they had deliver|ed the goods. The Indians di&s;covered their guilt by their countenances, &s;ome of them making towards him, thinking to get the weapon out of his hands; but he bid them &s;tand off, threatning to kill every one that offered to touch him; and immediately waved his cap over his head (which was the &s;ign agreed upon for all the &s;oldiers to come on &s;hore in ca&s;e of need) upon which token the &s;oldiers all ha&s;ted away. In the mean time the Engli&s;h that went on &s;hore to wait upon the Major, were forced to be&s;tir them&s;elves, both to &s;ecure the goods from being carried away, and to defend Ma|jor <HI>Waldern.</HI> Some of the &s;quaws, with others of the enemy ran away; one of them catched up a bundle of guns that were hid near by, and ran off with them. Captain <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> &s;eized an Indian called <HI>Megunnaway,</HI> a notorious rogue, (that had been in arms at <HI>Connecticut</HI> la&s;t <HI>June,</HI> at the <HI>Falls,</HI> and &s;aw the brave and re&s;o|lute Captain <HI>Turner,</HI> when he was &s;lain about <HI>Green-River;</HI> and helped to kill <HI>Thomas Bracket</HI> at <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t) and with the help of Lieut. <HI>Nutter,</HI> ac|cording to the Major's order, carried him on board, while him&s;elf &s;earching about farther, found three guns hid in a cow-hou&s;e ju&s;t at hand, wherewith he armed the other three men that were with him. By this time &s;ome of the &s;oldiers were got a&s;hore, and in&s;tantly, ac|cording to their Major's command, pur&s;ued the enemy towards their canoes; in the chace &s;everal of the ene|my were &s;lain, who&s;e bodies were found at their return to the number of &s;even, among&s;t whom was <HI>Mattaban|do</HI> the Sagamore, with an old Powaw, to whom the Devil had revealed, as &s;ometimes he did to <HI>Saul,</HI> that on the &s;ame day he &s;hould be with him; for he had a little before told the Indians, that within two days the Engli&s;h would come and kill them all, which was at the very &s;ame time verified upon him&s;elf. The body of our men overtook them before they all recovered their canoes, &s;o that without doubt, divers others of
<PB N="286" REF="014120_0316_0F9302685E315EC0">them were &s;lain likewi&s;e, for they &s;unk a canoe, where|in were five drowned before their eyes, and many o|thers were not able to paddle; four they took pri&s;o|ners, whom they brought away with them. There was about 25 Indians pre&s;ent at this encounter.</P>
<P>MUCH more damage might have been done by our men upon the enemy, if they had known the mo&s;t di|rect way to their canoes; but the Indians having pre|pared all things ready for flight, as well as for fight, the more ea&s;ily made their e&s;cape. One of the cap|tives was &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Madockawando,</HI> who was entertained very courteou&s;ly by the Commander in Chief, and would have been carried forthwith to her brother, in hopes by her means to have gained the better terms for our remaining Engli&s;h captives, had it not been certainly known that he was gone from home upon a hunting de&s;ign, and not to return in two months.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h took much plunder from the Indians, about a thou&s;and weight of dried beef, with other things. <HI>Megunnaway</HI> was &s;hot to death the &s;ame day or the next; &s;o that ju&s;tice is by degrees pur&s;uing tho&s;e perfidious villains, and one after another they are brought under the wheel of de&s;truction. <HI>Simon,</HI> that arch traitor, &s;eems as is &s;aid, by his con&s;umptive looks, to have received the &s;entence of death, which may bring him into the &s;ame place or &s;tate with the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 28th, they &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Sheep&s;cot,</HI> but the wind failing, they put in at <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> from whence Capt. <HI>Fi&s;k</HI> with 40 men, were &s;ent to the &s;aid place to &s;eek after plunder, where they found between 30 and 40 bu&s;hels of good wheat, which they brought away with them; &s;everal other things they lighted upon here and there, &s;ome of which were brought away, &s;uch as, one or two great guns, &s;ome anchors from <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> and boards from <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> where they found an hundred thou&s;and foot, of which they brought home enough for
<PB N="287" REF="014120_0317_0F93026919121B28">the lading of their ve&s;&s;els, leaving the re&s;t to be tran&s;|ported in a more convenient &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>WHILE our &s;oldiers were upon <HI>Arow&s;ick,</HI> two of the enemy chanced to come upon the place, one of them in&s;tantly received his reward, the other received his payment in part, which however is &s;uppo&s;ed to a|mount to the whole, the canoe wherein he was e&s;cape|ing, being found the next day all bloody, and &s;plit a&s;under.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1&s;t, one of the Indian &s;quaws, a captive, was &s;ent to <HI>Taconet</HI> fort, with a me&s;&s;age to the Sagamores to treat for the re&s;t of the captives. Five days were given her to return, which were not expired, when Major <HI>Waldern,</HI> with mo&s;t of the &s;oldiers were called to return home towards <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where they arrived on the 11th of <HI>March,</HI> 1676&mdash;7, having fir&s;t put in at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> bringing along with them the bones, or rather the body of Capt. <HI>Lake,</HI> pre&s;erved entire and whole, and free from putrefaction by the coldne&s;s of the long winter, &s;o as it was when found, by the di&s;|cretion of one that was near him when he was &s;lain, ea&s;ily di&s;cerned to be his, by &s;uch as had known him before.</P>
<P>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e that returned, that the ene|my are by this encounter of the Engli&s;h &s;o &s;cattered and broken, that they will not be able to rally again &s;uddenly, or make any attempt hereafter, if the pre|&s;ent advantage be &s;eriou&s;ly pur&s;ued. Thus have out enemies, many of them, fallen into the pit them&s;elves, which they have been digging for others.</P>
<P>THIS day al&s;o letters were received from Major <HI>Pynchon,</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> but without mention of any appearance of the enemy in that quarter; whereby we are encouraged to believe, that they have &s;tumb|led and fallen down backward, &s;o that they &s;hall ne|ver ri&s;e any more to make farther di&s;turbance. That
<PB N="288" REF="014120_0318_0F930269DA4098A8">which crowned the pre&s;ent &s;ervice was the performing it without lo&s;s of blood; all &s;afely returning. <HI>Let them accordingly remember to pay a &s;uitable tributs of thankfulne&s;s to him,</HI> under who&s;e banner they went forth and returned in &s;afety.</P>
