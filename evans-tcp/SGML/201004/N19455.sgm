<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of South America, like all other hi&s;tories of newly di&s;covered countries, has been &s;o interwoven with fable, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to deter the youthful &s;tudent from employing his time in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Trifles;</HI> for in that light fabulous hi&s;tories mu&s;t generally be con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Adventurers to the New World were mo&s;tly illiterate men, who&s;e principal pur&s;uits were gold and &s;ilver. On their return to their native &s;tate, their repre&s;entations were guided by intere&s;t and vanity; and, a&s;hamed of having made no ob&s;ervations on the rude arts, manufactures, and genius, of the people they had con|quered, they fabricated &s;tories the mo&s;t wild, romantic and ridiculous, to which the Spani&s;h writers of tho&s;e days gave a help|ing hand.</P>
<P>The literary world is undoubtedly much obliged to the labor, genius, and attention, of Dr. Robert&s;on, who&s;e exten&s;ive and polite connections enabled him to procure
<PB REF="025348_0004_0FCCDBA488F01218">information for his Hi&s;tory of America, which few other individuals could perhaps have obtained. We have therefore carefully con&s;ulted and followed that work, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which we may venture to &s;ay, that we have now the plea&s;ure of laying before our youthful Readers &s;uch an epit|ome of <HI>The Hi&s;tory of South America</HI> as may by no means be con&s;idered as fabulous, but as founded on the mo&s;t authentic mate|rials and authorities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>So nice and complicated are the arts of navigation and &s;hip-building, that they require the ingenuity and experience of many &s;ucceeding ages, to bring them to any tolerable degree of perfection. The raft or canoe, which at fir&s;t &s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o con|vey a &s;avage over a river, that ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">acted him in the cha&s;e, gave ri&s;e to the invention of con&s;tructing a ve&s;&s;el capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ving a number of people in &s;afety tood di&s;tant coa&s;t. Many efforts were made, many ex|periments were tried, and much labour and invention employed, before this important undertaking was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In proportion as the art of navigation encrea&s;ed, men became more acquainted
<PB N="2" REF="025348_0014_0FCD004157CF8CF0">with each other, and a commercial inter|cour&s;e commenced between remote nations. Men mu&s;t have made &s;ome con&s;iderable advancements towards civilization, before they acquired the idea of property, and a&s;|certained it &s;o perfectly, as to be acquainted with the mo&s;t &s;imple of all contracts, that of exchanging by barter one rude commod|ity for another. However, as &s;oon as this important right was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and every individual felt, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had an exclu&s;ive ti|tle to po&s;&s;e&s;s or alienate whatever he had acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature &s;ugge&s;ted to him, a new method of encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing his acqui&s;itions and enjoyments, by di&s;po&s;ing of what appeared to him &s;uperfluous, in or|der to procure what was nece&s;&s;ary or de&s;ir|able in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others.</P>
<P>As navigation and commerce extended, &s;o in cour&s;e did the intercour&s;e of remote nations. The ambition of conque&s;t or the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring new &s;ettlements, were no longer the &s;ole motives of vi&s;iting di&s;tant lands. The de&s;ire of gain became a new &s;pur to activity, rou&s;ed adventurers, and &s;ent them out on long voyages, in the pur|&s;uit of countries, who&s;e produce or want might encrea&s;e that circulation, which nour|i&s;hes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade proved a great &s;ource of di&s;covery, it open|ed unknown &s;eas, it penetrated into new
<PB N="3" REF="025348_0015_0FCD0042C77443A0">regions, and contributed more than any other cau&s;e, to bring men acquainted with the &s;ituation, the nature, and com|modities of the different regions of the earth.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed by the ancients was very rude and imperfect, and their method of working them on the ocean was very defective. Though the property of the magnet, by which it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients, its more important and amazing virtue of pointing to the poles had entirely e&s;caped their ob|&s;ervation. De&s;titute of this faithful guide, which now conducts the pilot with &s;o much certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the darkne&s;s of night, or when the heavens are covered with clouds, the ancients had no other method of regulating their cour&s;e than by ob&s;erving the &s;un and &s;tars. Their navigation was con&s;equently uncertain and timid. They dared not even to quit &s;ight of land, but crept along the coa&s;t, expo&s;ed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the ob&s;tructions anavoidable in holding &s;uch an aukward cour&s;e. An incredible length of time was requi&s;ite for performing voyages, which are now fini&s;hed in a &s;hort &s;pace. Even in the milde&s;t climates, and in the &s;eas the lea&s;t tempe&s;tuous, it was only during the &s;ummer months that the ancients ven|tured
<PB N="4" REF="025348_0016_0FCD004438D3B6D8">out of their harbours, the remainder of the year being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t in in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctivity.</P>
<P>The Egyptrans, &s;oon after the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their monarchy, are reported to have commence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> trade between the Ara|bian Gulph, or Red Sea, and the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the great India continent. The commodities, which they imported from the Ea&s;t were carried by land from the Ara|bian Gulph to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down that river to the Mediterra|nean; but the fertile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oil and mild climate of Egypt, producing all the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, the Egyptians, had no in|ducements to undertake long and hazardous voyages.</P>
<P>The Phenicians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pirit more favourable to commerce and di&s;covery than the Egyptian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. They had not like the natives of Egyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, any di&s;tingui&s;hing peculiarity in their manners and in&s;titutions: they were not addicted to any &s;ingular and un&s;ocial form of &s;uper&s;tition and could mingle with other nations without &s;cruple or reluctance. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itory they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was neither large, nor fer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, and commerce was the only &s;ource from which they could derive opu|lence or power. The trade, therefore, car|ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyte was mote excen&s;ive and enterpri&s;ing than that of any &s;tate in the ancient world. In many of the places to which they re&s;or|ted,
<PB N="5" REF="025348_0017_0FCD00465A17A448">they planted colonies, and communi|cated to the rude inhabitants &s;ome knowl|edge of their arts and improvements.</P>
<P>The Jews, encouraged by the riches they &s;aw the Phenecians acquiring from commerce &s;eemed de&s;irous to endeavour to partake of it. Solomon fitted out fleets, which under the direction of Phenician pi|lots, &s;ailed from the Red Sea to Tar&s;hi&s;h and Ophir; but the &s;ingular in&s;titution of the Jews, the ob&s;ervance of which was enjoin|ed by their Divine Legi&s;lator. with an in|tention of pre&s;erving them a &s;eparate peo|ple, unin&s;ected by idolatry, prevented their being numbered among the nations, which contributed to improve navigation, or to make any material or u&s;eful di&s;overies.</P>
<P>The Carthagenians caught the &s;pirit of commerce from the Phenecians and Jews. The commonwealth of Carthage applied to trade and naval a&s;&s;airs with the greate&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s. They extended their navigation chiefly towards the we&s;t and north, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted not only all the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts of Spain, but tho&s;e of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l, and penetrated at la&s;t into Britain.

<PB N="6" REF="025348_0018_0FCD004815D59980">placed &s;everal colonies, in order to civilize the natives, and accu&s;tom them to com|merce.</P>
<P>It is evident that the Phenicians, who in&s;tructed the Greeks in many u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences did not communitate to them that exten&s;ive knowledge of navigation, which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial &s;pirit and ardour for di&s;covery, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed their rivals the Carthagenians. Though Greece be almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea, which formed many &s;pacious bays and commodious harbours: though it be &s;urrounded by a va&s;t number of fertile i&s;l|ands, yet, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a favoura|ble &s;ituation, which &s;eemed to invite that in|genious people to apply them&s;elves to navi|gation, it was long before this art attained any degree of perfection among them. E|ven at the time, when the Greeks engaged in the famous enterprize again&s;t Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs &s;eems not to have been much improved. Their ve&s;&s;els were of incon&s;iderable burthen and mo&s;tly with|out deeks. The&s;e had only one ma&s;t, and they were &s;trangers to the u&s;e of anchors. All their operations in &s;ailing were clum&s;y and un&s;kilful.</P>
<P>The expedition of Alexander the Great into the Ea&s;t, con&s;iderably enlarged the &s;phere of navigation and of geographical
<PB N="7" REF="025348_0019_0FCD0049B1DB5610">knowledge among the Greeks. He found|ed a great city, which he called Alexandria, near one of the mouths of the river Nile, that by the Mediterranean &s;ea, and the neighbourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it might command the trade both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t. This &s;ituation was cho&s;en with &s;uch di&s;cernment, that Alexandria &s;oon be|came the chief commercial city in the world.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s made by the Romans in navigation and di&s;covery, was &s;till more in|con&s;iderable than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Roman people, their military education, and the &s;pirit of their laws con|curred to di&s;courage them from commerce and naval affairs. It was the nece&s;&s;ity of oppo&s;ing a formidable rival, not the de&s;ire of extending trade, which fir&s;t prompted them to aim at maritime power.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Romans acquired a ta&s;te for the luxuries of the Ea&s;t, the trade with India through Egypt was pu&s;hed with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the Indian continent, navi|gators became acquainted with the periodi|cal cour&s;e of the winds, which, in the o|cean that &s;eparates Africa from India, blow with little variation during one half of the year from the Ea&s;t, and during the other half blow with equal &s;teadine&s;s from the We&s;t. Encouraged by this ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="8" REF="025348_0020_0FCD004B048E5220">they abandoned their ancient &s;low and dan|gerous cour&s;e along the coa&s;t, and as &s;oon as the we&s;tern mon&s;oon &s;et in took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and &s;tretched boldly acro&s;s the ocean. The uniform direction of the wind, &s;upplying the place of the compa&s;s, and rendering the guidance of the &s;tars le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary conducted them to the port of Mu&s;iris, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the In|dian continent&mdash;There they took on board their cargo, and returning with the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon, fini&s;hed their voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year.

<P>The di&s;covery of this new method of failing to India, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable improvement in navigation made by the Romans during the continuance of their power. In ancient times, the knowledge of remote countries was more frequently acquired by land than by &s;ea; and the Ro|mans, from their particular di&s;like to mari|time affairs, may be &s;aid to have totally neg|lected the latter, though a much more pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ble way to make di&s;coveries, being more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y and expeditious.</P>
<P>If we reject fabulous and ob&s;cure ac|counts, if we clo&s;ely abide by the light and
<PB N="9" REF="025348_0021_0FCD004CF9DAAB40">information of authentic hi&s;tory, without giving way to the conjectures of fancy, or the dreams of etymologi&s;ts, we mu&s;t con|clude, that the knowledge which the an|cients had acquired of the habitable globe was very confined and &s;uperficial. In Eu|rope, the exten&s;ive provinces in the ea&s;tern part of Germany were little known to them. They were almo&s;t totally unacquainted with the va&s;t countries which are now &s;ub|ject to the kings of Denmark, Sweden, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u|&s;ia, Poland, and the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. The more barren regions, which &s;tretch within the arctic circle were quite unexplored. In Africa, their re&s;earches did not extend far beyond the provinces which border on the Mediterranean, and tho&s;e &s;ituated on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Arabian Gulf. In A&s;ia, they were unacquained with all the fertile and delightful countries beyond the Ganges, which furni&s;h the mo&s;t valuable commodities for the European commerce with India; nor do they &s;eem to have ever penetrated into tho&s;e immen&s;e regions, oc|cupied by the wandering tribes, which they called by the general name of Sycthians, and now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Tartars of various denom|inations, and by the A&s;iatic Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But however imperfect or inaccurate the geographical knowledge which the Greeks and Romans had acquired may appear, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of that
<PB N="10" REF="025348_0022_0FCD004F23E7F4A0">&s;cience, their progre&s;s in di&s;covery will &s;eem con&s;iderable, and the extent to which they carried navigation and commerce, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as great, when compared with the ignorance of early times. Geography continued to improve under the Romans &s;o long as they remained in their powerful &s;tate; But when the barbarians broke in upon them, the con&s;equence of luxury and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferninacy, the &s;ciences then dwindled, and di&s;coveries cea&s;ed to be made.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantinople, after the de&s;truction of the Roman empire, tho' often threatened by the fierce invaders, who &s;pread de&s;ola|tion over the re&s;t of Europe, was &s;o for|tunate as to e&s;cape their de&s;tructive rage. The knowledge of ancient arts and di&s;cov|ries were pre&s;erved in that city, a ta&s;te for &s;plendour and elegance &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the productions and luxuries of foreign coun|tries were in reque&s;t, and commerce con|tinued to flouri&s;h in Con&s;tantinople, when it was almo&s;t extinct in every other part of Europe.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time, a gleam of light and knowledge broke in upon the Ea&s;t. The Arabians, having contracted &s;ome re|li&s;h for the &s;ciences of the people who&s;e empire they had contributed to overturn, tran&s;lated the books of &s;everal of the Greek philo&s;ophers into their own language. The &s;tudy of geography in cour&s;e became an
<PB N="11" REF="025348_0023_0FCD005043D137F8">early object of attention to the Arabians: but the acute and the ingenious people cul|tivated chiefly the &s;peculative and &s;cientific parts of geography. In order to a&s;certain the figure and dimen&s;ions of our earth, they applied the principles of geometry, they had recour&s;e, to a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations, and employed experiments and operations, which Europe, in more enlightened times, have eagerly adopted and imitated.</P>
<P>The calamities and de&s;olation brought upon the we&s;tern provinces of the Roman empire by its barbarous conquerors, by degrees were forgotten, and in &s;ome mea&s;|ure repaired. The rude tribes which &s;ettled there, acquiring in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ome idea of reg|ular government, and &s;ome reli&s;h for the functions and comforts of civil life. Europe awakened, in &s;ome degree, from its torpid and inactive &s;tate, the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of which were di&s;cerned in Italy. The acqui&s;i|tion of the&s;e rou&s;ed indu&s;try, and gave motion and vigour to all the active powers of the human mind: foreign commerce re|vived, navigation was attended to, and great pains taken to improve it.</P>
<P>From that period, the commercial &s;pirit of Italy became active and enterprizing. Venice, Genoa, and Pi&s;a, ro&s;e from incon|&s;iderable towns, to be populous and wealthy cities; their naval power encrea&s;ed, their ve&s;&s;els frequented not only all the ports in
<PB N="12" REF="025348_0024_0FCD0051CAA2CF10">the Mediterranean, but venturing &s;ometimes beyond the &s;traits, vi&s;ited the maritime towns of Spain, France, the Low Coun|tries, and England.</P>
<P>While the cities of Italy were thus ad|vancing in their career of improvement, an event happened, the mo&s;t extraordinary perhaps in the hi&s;tory of mankind, which, in&s;tead of ob&s;tructing the commercial pro|gre&s;s of the Italians, contributed to its encrea&s;e. The martial &s;pirit of the Enro|peans, heightened and inflamed by religious zeal, prompted them to attempt the deliv|erance of the Holy Land from the domin|ion of infidels. Va&s;t armies compo&s;ed of all the nations in Europe, moved towards A&s;ia on this &s;trange enterpri&s;e. The Geno|e&s;e. Pi&s;ans and Venetians furni&s;hed the tran&s;|ports to carry them thither, and &s;upphed them with provi&s;ions and military &s;tores. Be|&s;ides the immen&s;e &s;ums which they received on this account they obtained commercial privileges and e&s;tabli&s;hments. From the&s;e &s;ources prodigious wealth flowed into the ci|ties above mentioned This was accompa|nied with a proportional increa&s;e of power, and by the and of the Holy War, Venice, in particular, became a great maritime &s;tate, po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ing an exten&s;ive commerce and ample territories.</P>
<P>Communications being thus opened between Europe and the we&s;tern provinces
<PB N="13" REF="025348_0025_0FCD005362C16660">of A&s;ia, &s;everal per&s;ons were encouraged to advance far beyond the countries, in which the cru&s;aders carried on their opera|tions, and to travel by land into the more remote and opulent regions of the Ea&s;t. The wild fanatici&s;ms, which &s;eem at that period to have mingled in all the &s;chemes of individuals, no le&s;s than in all the coun|cils of nations, fir&s;t incited men to enter upon the&s;e long and dangerous excur&s;ions. They were afterwards undertaken from pro&s;pects of commercial advantage, or from motives of mere curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this ri&s;ing de&s;ire for di&s;|covery a very fortunate event took place, which contributed more than all the efforts and ingenuity of preceeding ages to improve and extend navigation. That wonderful property of the magnet, by which it com|municates &s;uch virtue to a needle or &s;len|der rod of iron, as to point towards the poles of the earth, was happily di&s;covered. The u&s;e which might be made of this in directing navigation, was immediately perceived. From hence, that mo&s;t valua|ble, but now familiar in&s;trument, the mar|iners compa&s;s was formed. As &s;oon as navigators found by means of this, that at all &s;ea&s;ons, and in every place, they could di&s;cover the North and South with &s;o much ea&s;e and accuracy, it became no longer nece&s;&s;ary to depend merely on the light of
<PB N="14" REF="025348_0026_0FCD0054F8DC9C30">the &s;tars, and the ob&s;ervation of the &s;ea|coa&s;t They gradually abandoned their an|cient timid and lingering cour&s;e along the &s;hore, launched boldly into the ocean, and relying on this new guide, could &s;teer in the darke&s;t night, and under the mo&s;t cloudy &s;ky, with a &s;ecurity and preci&s;ion hitherto unknown. The compa&s;s may be &s;aid to have opened to man the dominion of the &s;ea, and to have put him in full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the earth, by enabling him to vi&s;it every part of it.</P>
<P>About the year 1365, Providence &s;eemed to have decreed, that at this period men were to pa&s;s the limits within which they had been &s;o long confined, and open to them&s;elves a more ample field, wherein to di&s;play their talents, their enterpri&s;e, and courage. The fir&s;t con&s;iderable efforts towards this were not made by any of the more powerful &s;tates of Europe, or by tho&s;e who had applied to navigation with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s. The glo|ry of taking the lead in this bold attempt was re&s;erved for the Portugue&s;e, who&s;e kingdom was the &s;malle&s;t and lea&s;t powerful o' any in Europe. As the attempts of the Portugue&s;e to acquire the knowledge of tho&s;e parts of the globe, with which man|kind were then unacquainted, not only im|proved and extended the art of navigation, but rou&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit of curio&s;ity and
<PB N="15" REF="025348_0027_0FCD005640573FF0">enterprize, as led to the di&s;covery of the New World, of which we are pre&s;ently to give the in&s;tory.</P>
<P>Various circum&s;tances urged the Portu|gue&s;e to exert their activity in this new direction, and enab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them to accompli&s;h undertakings apparently &s;uperior to the na|tural force of their monarchy. John I. King of Portugal, &s;urnamed the Ba&s;tard, having obtained &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, in the year 1411, &s;oon perceived, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve pub|lic order, or dome&s;tic tranquility, without finding &s;ome employment for the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of his &s;ubjects. With this view, he a&s;&s;embled a numerous fleet at Li&s;bon, compo&s;ed of all the &s;hips he could fit out in his own kingdom, and of many hired from foreigners. This great armament fitted out in 1412, was de&s;tined to attack the Moors &s;ettled on the coa&s;ts of Barbary. While the fleet was equipping, a few ve&s;|&s;els were appointed to &s;ail along the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa, bounded by the Atlantic ocean, and to di&s;cover the unknown coun|tries &s;ituated there.</P>
<P>The particular &s;ituation of Portugal was an invitation to this new undertaking, and the genius of the age being favourable to the execution of it, it proved &s;ucce&s;sful. The ve&s;&s;els &s;ent on the di&s;covery doubled the formidable Cape Non, which had ter|minated
<PB N="16" REF="025348_0028_0FCD00581954F470">the progre&s;s of former navigators, and proceeded one hundred and &s;ixty miles bevond it, to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which &s;tretched a con&s;iderable way into the Atlantic, appeared more dreadful than the promontory they had pa&s;&s;ed, the Portugue&s;e commander was afraid to at|tempt to &s;ail round it, but returned to Lif|bon, more &s;atisfied with having advanced &s;o far, than a&s;hamed of not having gone further.</P>
<P>Though this voyage was in it&s;elf incon|&s;iderable, yet it increa&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ion for di&s;covery, which began to &s;hew it&s;elf in Portugal. The fortunate i&s;&s;ue of the king's expedition again&s;t the Moors of Barbary, ad|ded &s;trength to that &s;pirit in the nation, and pu&s;hed it on to new undertakings. In order to render the&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould be conducted by a per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities capable of di&s;cerning what was attainable, who enjoyed lei&s;ure to form a regular &s;y&s;tem for pro&s;ecuting di&s;covery, and who was animated with ar|dour, that would per&s;evere in &s;pite of ob|&s;tacles and repul&s;es: happil; for Portugal, &s;he found all the&s;e qualities in Henry duke of Vi&s;eo, the fourth &s;on of King John. That prince, in his early youth having ac|companied his father in his expedition to Barbary, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by many deeds of valour. To the mar&s;hal &s;pirit,
<PB N="17" REF="025348_0029_0FCD005951D41E10">which was the characteri&s;tic of every man of noble birth at that period, he added all the accompli&s;hment of a more enlightened and poli&s;hed age. He cultivated the arts and &s;ciences, which were then little known, and de&s;pi&s;ed by per&s;ons of his exalted &s;itua|tion. He was particularly fond of the &s;tu|dy of geography, and he early acquired &s;uch a knowledge of the habitable globe, as di&s;|covered the great probability of finding new and opulent countries, by &s;ailing along the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>The commencement of every new under|taking isu&s;ually attended with trifling &s;ucce&s;s. In the year 1418, he fitted out a &s;ingle &s;hip, and gave the command of it to two gentle|men of his hou&s;ehold, who offered them&s;elves as volunteers to conduct the enterpri&s;e. He in&s;tructed them to double Cape Bojador, and thence to &s;teer towards the &s;outh. They held their cour&s;e along the &s;hore, the mode of navigation which &s;till prevailed, when a &s;udden &s;quall of wind aro&s;e, which drove them out to &s;ea, and, when they expected every moment to peri&s;h, it blew thein on an unknown i&s;land, which, from their hap|py e&s;cape, they armed Porto San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o. They in&s;tantly returned to Portugal with the news of their di&s;covery, and were received by Henry with the applau&s;e and honour due to fortunate adventurers.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="025348_0030_0FCD005B7A09C9C0">
The next year Henry &s;ent out three &s;hips under the &s;ame commanders, in order to make a &s;ettlement in Porto Santo. From this i&s;land they ob&s;erved towards the &s;outh a fixed &s;pot in the horizon, like a &s;mall black cloud. They were by degrees led to con|jecture it might be land, and &s;teering to|wards it, they arrived at a con&s;iderable i&s;l|and, uninhabited and covered with wood, which on that account they called Madeira. As it was Henry's principal object to rend|er his di&s;coveries u&s;eful to his country, he immediately equiped a fleet to carry a colo|ny of Portugue&s;e to the&s;e i&s;lands. He took care that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed not only with the &s;eeds, plants, and dome&s;tic animals common in Europe, but, as he fore&s;aw that the warmth of the climate and fertility of the &s;oil, would prove favorable to the rearing of other productions, he procured &s;lips of the vine from the i&s;land of Cyprus, the rich wines of which were then in great reque&s;t, and plants of the &s;ugar cane from Sicily, into which it had been recently introduced.&mdash; The&s;e throve &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly in this new country, that the advantage of their culture was immediately perceived, and the &s;ugar and wine of Madeira, &s;oon became con&s;id|erable articles of commerce, from which the Portugue&s;e derived great advantage.</P>
<P>The&s;e important &s;ucce&s;&s;es gave a &s;pur to the &s;pirit of di&s;covery, and induced the
<PB N="19" REF="025348_0031_0FCD005E1C1B3C78">Portugue&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;ervilely creeping along the coa&s;t, to venture into the open &s;ea. They doubled Cape Bojador, in 1433, and advanced within the tropics. In the cour&s;e of a &s;ew years they di&s;covered the river Se|negal, and all the coa&s;t extending from Cape Blanco, to Cape de Verde.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e had hitherto been guided in their di&s;coveries, or encouraged to at|tempt them, by the light and information they received from the works of the ancient mathematicians and geographers; but when they began to enter the torrid zone, the notions which prevailed among the ancients that the heat was &s;o inten&s;e as to render it in&s;upportable, detered them, for &s;ome time, from proceeding. However, notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e unfavorable appearances, in 1449 the Portugue&s;e di&s;covered the Cape de Verde i&s;lands, which lie off the promontory of that name, and &s;oon after the i&s;les called Azores. As the former of the&s;e are above three hundred miles from the African coa&s;t, and the latter nine hundred miles from any continent, it is evident that the Portugue&s;e had made great advances in the art of navi|gation.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion for di&s;coveries received an unfortunate check by the death of Prince Henry, who&s;e &s;uperior knowledge had hitherto directed all the operations of the di&s;coverers &amp; who&s;e patronage had encourag|ed
<PB N="20" REF="025348_0032_0FCD005F414DA610">and protected them. However notwith|&s;tanding all the advantages they derived from hence, the Portugue&s;e, during his life, did not advance, in their utmo&s;t progre&s;s to|wards the &s;outh, within five degrees of the equinoctial line; and after their continued exertions for half a century, hardly 1500 miles of the coa&s;t of Africa was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e in 1471, ventured to cro&s;s the line, and, to their a&s;toni&s;hment, found that region of the torid zone, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;corched with intolerable heat, to the habitable, populous, and fertile.</P>
<P>Under the direction of John II. in 1484, a powerful fleet was fitted out, which ad+vanced above fifteen hundred miles beyond the line, and the Portugue&s;e, for the fir&s;t time beheld a new heaven, and ob&s;erved the &s;tars of another hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>By their con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the people of Africa, they gradually acquired &s;ome knowledge of tho&s;e parts of that country, which they had not vi&s;ited. The information they received from the natives. added to what they had ob&s;erved in their own voyages, began to open pro&s;pects of a more exten&s;ive nature. They &s;ound, as they proceeded &s;outhward, that the continent of Africa, in&s;tead of extending in breadth, ac|cording to the doctrine of Prolemy, ap|peared &s;en&s;ibly to contract it&s;elf and to bend towards the ea&s;t. This induced them to
<PB N="21" REF="025348_0033_0FCD0060C3555520">give credit to the ancient Phenician voyages round Africa, which had long been con&s;id|ered as fabulous, and gave them rea&s;on to hope, that by following the &s;ame route, they might arrive at the Ea&s;t Indies, and engro&s;s that commerce, which had &s;o long contrib|uted to enrich other powers.</P>
<P>In 1486, the conduct of a voyage for this purpo&s;e, the mo&s;t dangerous and difficult the Portugue&s;e had ever embarked in, was entru&s;ted to Barthelomew Diaz, who &s;tretch|ed boldly towards the &s;outh, and proceeding beyond the utmo&s;t limits to which his coun|trymen had hitherto advanced di&s;cover|ed near a thou&s;and miles of a new|country. Neither the combined powers of violent tempe&s;ts, and the frequent mutinies of his crew, nor even the calamities of famine, which he &s;uffered from lo&s;ing his &s;tore &s;hip, could deter him from the pur&s;uit of his grand object. In &s;pite of all, he at la&s;t di&s;|covered that lofty promontory which bounds Africa to the &s;outh; but he did nothing more than di&s;cover it. The violence of the winds, the &s;hattered condition of his &s;hips, and the turbulent &s;pirit of his &s;ailors com|pelled him to return after a voyage of 16 months. The king of Portugal, as he now entertained no doubt of having found the long de&s;ired route to India, gave this pro|montory the name of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025348_0034_0FCD0062B07837E8">
The&s;e &s;anguine ideas of &s;ucce&s;s were &s;trengthened by the intelligence the king received over land, in con&s;equence of his emba&s;&s;y to Aby&s;&s;inia. Covillam and Payva, by the King's in&s;tructions, had repaired to Grand Cairo. From this city they traveled in company with a caravan of Egyptian merchants, and embarking on the Red Sea, arrived at Arden, in Arabia. There they &s;eparated; Payva &s;ailed directly towards Aby&s;&s;inia; Covillam embarked for the Ea&s;t Indies, and having vi&s;ited Calecut, Goa, and other cities of the Malabar coa&s;t, returned to Sofala, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Africa, and thence to Crand Cairo, which Payva and be had fixed upon as their place of meeting. The former however was unfortunately and cruelly murdered in Aby&s;&s;inia: but Covil|lam found at Cairo two Portugue&s;e Jews, whom the King of Portugal had di&s;patched after them, in order to receive an account of their proceedings, and to communicate to them new in&s;tructions. By one of the&s;e Jews Covillam tran&s;mitted to Portugal a journal of his proceedings by &s;ea and land, his remarks upon the trade of India, togeth|er with exact maps of the coa&s;t on which he had toutched; and from what he him&s;elf had ob&s;erved, as well as from the informa|tion of &s;killful &s;eamen in different countries, he concluded, that by &s;ailing round Africa, a pa&s;&s;age might be found to the Ea&s;t In|dies.
<PB N="23" REF="025348_0035_0FCD0063C2C820B0">The happy coincidence of Covillam's report and opinion with the di&s;coveries lately made by Diaz, left hardly any &s;hadow of doubt with re&s;pect to the po&s;&s;ibility of failing from Europe. However, the va&s;t length of the voyage, and the furious &s;torms, which Diaz had encountered near the Cape of Good Hope, alarmed and intimi|dated the Portugue&s;e to &s;uch a degree, although they were become adventurous and &s;kilful mariners, that &s;ome time was requi&s;ite to prepare their minds for this dangerous and extraordinary voyage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, a &s;ubject of the republic of Genoa, was among the foremo&s;t of tho&s;e foreigners whom the fame of the di&s;coveries made by the Portugue&s;e had allured into their &s;ervice. Though neither the time nor place of his birth are certainly known, yet it is on all hands agreed, that he was de&s;cended from an honourable family re|duced to indigence by misfortunes. As his ance&s;tors were accu&s;tomed to a &s;ea|faring life, Columbus became naturally fond of it him&s;elf, and very early di&s;cover|ed tho&s;e talents for that profe&s;&s;ion, which plainly indicated the great man he was one day to be. He applied with uncommon ardour to the &s;tudy of the Latin tongue. geography, a&s;tronomy, and the art of drawing. Thus qualified, in 1461, at the age of fourteen, he went to &s;ea, and began his career on that element, which con|ducted him to &s;o much glory.</P>
<P>In 1467, he repaired to Li&s;bon, where many of his countrymen were &s;ettled. They &s;oon conceived &s;uch a favourable opinion of his merit and talents, that they warmly &s;olicited him to remain in their kingdom, where his naval &s;kill and ex|perience
<PB N="25" REF="025348_0037_0FCD0066F767CEB0">could not fail of rendering him con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>To find out a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to the Ea&s;t Indies, was the great object in view at that period. From the time that the Por|tugue&s;e doubled Cape de Verde, this was the point at which they aimed in all their navigations. The tediou&s;ne&s;s of the cour&s;e, which the Portugue&s;e were pur|&s;uing, naturally led Columbus to con&s;ider, whether a &s;horter and more direct pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies, than that projected by &s;ailing round the African continent, might not be found out. After revolving long and &s;eriou&s;ly every cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um&s;tance &s;ugge&s;ted by his &s;uperior knowledge in the theory, as well as practice of navigation, after comparing attentively the ob&s;ervations of modern pilots, with the hints and con|jectures of ancient authors, he at la&s;t concluded, that by &s;ailing directly towards the We&s;t, acro&s;s the Atlantic ocean, new countries, which probably fomed a part of the va&s;t continent of India, mu&s;t in|fallibly be di&s;covered</P>
<P>Filled with the&s;e ideas, he laid his &s;cheme before the &s;enate of Genoa, and making his country the fir&s;t tender of his &s;ervice, offered to fail under the banners of the republic, in que&s;t of the new regions he expected to di&s;cover, but they incon&s;i|derately
<PB N="26" REF="025348_0038_0FCD00696C924F10">rejected his propo&s;al, as a dream of a chimerical projector He then &s;ub|mitted his plan to the Portugue&s;e, who endeavoured to rob him of the honour, by &s;ending another per&s;on privately to pur&s;ue the &s;ame track propo&s;ed be him; but the pilot, cho&s;en to execute Colum|bus's plan, had neither the genius not the fortitude of its author. Contrary winds aro&s;e, no &s;ight of approaching land ap|peared, his courage failed, and he return|ed to Li&s;bon, execrating a plan, which he had not abilities to execute.</P>
<P>Columbus no &s;ooner di&s;covered this di&s;honorable treatment, than he in&s;tantly quitted Portugal in di&s;gu&s;t, and repaired to Spain about the clo&s;e of the year 1484. Here he re&s;olved to propo&s;e it in per&s;on to Ferdinand and I&s;abella, who at that time governed the united kingdoms of Ca&s;tile and Arragon. He al&s;o &s;ent his brother to England, to propo&s;e his plan to Henry VIII.</P>
<P>After a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mortifying cir|cum&s;tances and di&s;appointments, I&s;abella was per&s;uaded to &s;end for Columbus to court. The cordial reception he there met with from the queen, together with the near pro&s;pect of &s;etting out upon that voyage, which had &s;o long been the object of his thoughts and wi&s;he, &s;oon effaced

<P>Ferdinand, though his name appears conjoined with that or I&s;abella in this tran&s;action, refu&s;ed to take any part in it as King of Arragon, his di&s;tru&s;t of Co|lumbus being very violent.</P>
<P>After all the efforts of I&s;abella and Co|lumbus, the armament was not &s;uitable, either to the dignity of the power who equipped it, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the importance of the &s;ervice to which it was de&s;tined. It con|&s;i&s;ted of three ve&s;&s;els. The large&s;t, a &s;hip of no con&s;iderable burden, was command|ed by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name or Santa Maria. Of the &s;econd, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third, named the Nigna, was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon.
<PB N="29" REF="025348_0041_0FCD006ED6F08B18">The&s;e two were light ve&s;&s;els, hardly &s;u|perior in burden or force to large boats. The &s;um employed in the whole of this equipment did not exceed 4000 l.</P>
<P>On the 3d day of Augu&s;t, 1492. Columbus &s;et &s;ail, a little before &s;un-ri&s;e in pre&s;ence of a va&s;t crowd of &s;pectators, who &s;ent up their &s;upplications to heaven for the pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue of the voyage, which they wi&s;hed rather than expected. Columbus &s;teered directly for the Canary I&s;lands, from whence he departed on the 6th of September. In the &s;hort run to the Canaries, the &s;hips were found to be &s;o crazy and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a navigation, which was ex|pected to be both long and dangerous.</P>
<P>Columbus, on leaving the Canaries, held his cour&s;e due we&s;t, left immediately the u&s;ual track of navigation, and &s;tretch|ed into unfrequented and unknown &s;eas. By the 14th of September, the fleet was about two hundred leagues to the We&s;t of the Canary i&s;lands, at a greater Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance from land than any Spaniard had been be ore that time.

<PB N="30" REF="025348_0042_0FCD007096F08B18">to ari&s;e from the ignorance and timidity of the people under his command. All the art and addre&s;s he was ma&s;ter of was hard|ly &s;ufficient to quell the mutinous di&s;po&s;i|tion of his &s;ailors; who grew the more turbulent, in proportion as their di&s;tance encrea&s;ed from home.</P>
<P>On the 11th of October, Columbus was &s;o confident of being near land, that he ordered the &s;ails to be furled, and the &s;hips to lie by, keeping &s;trict watch, le&s;t they &s;hould be driven on &s;hore in the night. During this interval of &s;u&s;pence and expectation, no man &s;hut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently to|wards that quarter where they expected to di&s;cover the land, which had been &s;o long the object of their wi&s;hes. A little after midnight, the joyful &s;ound of <HI>land! land!</HI> was heard from the Pinta, which kept always a-head of the other &s;hips; but, having been &s;o often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become &s;low of belief, and waited, in all the an|gui&s;h of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day.</P>
<P>On the 12th of October, as &s;oon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were di&s;pelled. From every &s;hip an i&s;land was &s;een about two leagues to the North, who&s;e flat and verdant fields, well &s;tored

The crew of the Pinta in&s;tant|ly began the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> as a hymn of thank&s;giving to God, and were joined by tho&s;e of the other &s;hips, with tears of joy and tran&s;ports of congratulation. They then on their knees begged pardon of Columbus for the mutinous &s;pirit they had &s;hewn, acknowledged his &s;uperior abilities, and promi&s;ed implicit obedience to his will in &s;uture.</P>
<P>The boats being manned and armed as &s;oon as the &s;un aro&s;e, they rowed towards the i&s;land with their colours di&s;played, warlike mu&s;ic, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coa&s;t, they &s;aw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the &s;pectacle had drawn to|gether, who&s;e attitudes and ge&s;tures ex|pre&s;&s;ed wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;trange objects-before them. He landed in a rich dre&s;s, with a &s;word in his hand. His men followed, and kneeling down, they all ki&s;&s;ed the ground which they had &s;o long de&s;ired to &s;ee. They then took &s;olemn po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country for the crown of Ca&s;tile and Leon.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Spaniards, the white|ne&s;s or their &s;kins, their beards, their arms, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peared &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing to the

<P>The Spaniards were no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at the novelty of their &s;ituation. Every herb, &s;hrub, and tree, was different from tho&s;e which flouri&s;hed in Europe. The inhabitants appeared in the &s;imple inno|cence of nature, entirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated upon their &s;houlders, or was bound in tre&s;&s;es round their Leads. They had no beards, and every part of their bodies was perfectly &s;mooth. Their complexion was of a du&s;ky copper colour, their features &s;ingular, rather than di&s;agreeable, and their a&s;pect gentle and timid. They were at fir&s;t &s;hy through fear, but &s;oon be, came familiar with the Spaniards, and with tran&s;ports of joy received from them hawks bells, gla&s;s beads, or other baubles, in return for which they gave &s;uch pro|vi&s;ions as they had, and &s;ome cotton yarn, the only commodity of value that they could produce. Thus in the fir&s;t inter|view
<PB N="33" REF="025348_0045_0FCD00743A52C940">between the inhabitants of the new and old worlds, every thing was conducted amicably and to their mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Columbus now a&s;&s;umed the title and authority of admiral and viceroy, and called the i&s;land he had di&s;covered San Salvador. It is one of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ge lu&s;ter of i&s;lands called the Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ya <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bahama i&s;les.

<P>It &s;oon appeared evident to Columbus that this was but a poor plare, and con&s;e|quently not the object of his pur&s;uit. But, conformably to his theory concerning the di&s;covery of tho&s;e regions of A&s;ia, which &s;tretched towards the ea&s;t, he concluded that San Salvador was one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, which geographers de&s;cribed as &s;ituated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the va&s;t ocean adjacent to India; but he was herein mi&s;taken.

They pointed towards the &s;outh, and made him comprehend by &s;igns, that gold abounded in countries &s;ituated in that quarter.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this intelligence, he &s;ailed to the &s;outhward and &s;aw &s;everal
<PB N="34" REF="025348_0046_0FCD0075B8045500">I&s;lands. He touched at tho&s;e of the large&s;t, on which he be&s;towed the names of St. Mary, Fernandina, and I&s;abella; but, as all his enquiries were after gold, and none of them produced any, he made no &s;tay in any of them. He afterwards di&s;covered Cuba, and &s;oon after fell in with Hi&s;pan|iola.</P>
<P>Columbus, &s;till intent on di&s;covering the mines which yielded gold, &s;ailed from hence on the 24th of December, 1492. The great variety of bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was engaged having prevented Colum|bus from taking any &s;leep for two days, he retired at midnight to take &s;ome re|po&s;e, having committed the helm to the pilot, with &s;trict injunction not to quit it for a moment. The pilot dreading no danger, carele&s;sly left the helm to an unexperienced cabin-boy, and the &s;hip, carried away by a current, was da&s;hed again&s;t a rock. The violence of the &s;hock awaked Columbus. He ran up to the deck, where all was confu&s;ion and de&s;pair, he alone retaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ence of mind. How|ever all his endeavors were in vain; the ve&s;&s;el opened near the keel, and filled &s;o fa&s;t with water that its lo&s;s was inevitable. The boats from the Nigna &s;aved the crew, and the natives in their canoes did every thing in their power to &s;erve them, by

<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of Columbus was at this time very great. The Pinta had failed away from him, and he &s;u&s;pected was treacherou&s;ly gone to Europe. There re|mained but one ve&s;&s;el, and that the &s;mal|le&s;t and mo&s;t crazy of the &s;quadron, to traver&s;e &s;uch a va&s;t oce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and carry &s;o many men back to Europe. He re&s;olved therefore to leave a part of his crew on the i&s;land, that, by re&s;iding there, they might learn the language of the natives, &s;tudy their di&s;po&s;itions, &s;earch for mines, and prepare for the commodious &s;ettlement of the colony, with which he propo&s;ed to return. Having &s;ettled this bu&s;ine&s;s with his men and the natives, he built a fort, and placed in it the guns &s;aved out of his own &s;hip. He appointed thirty-eight of his people to remain on the i&s;land, under the command of Diego de Arada, and fur|ni&s;hed them with every thing requi&s;ite for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or defence of the infant colony.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled matters, he left Navidad on the 4th of January, 1493, and &s;tretching towards he ea&s;t, di&s;covered and gave names to mo&s;t of the harbors on the northern coa&s;t of the i&s;land.

Pinzon endeavored to ju&s;tify his conduct, and though Columbus was by no means &s;atisfied in his own mind, yet he thought it prudent to di&s;&s;emble at pre&s;ent, and ac|cordingly received him again into favour.

<P>Columbus now found it nece&s;&s;ary, from the condition of his &s;hips, and the temper of his men, to return to Europe.

Every mark of honor, that gratitude or admiration could &s;ugge&s;t, was conferred upon Columbus. Letters patent were i&s;&s;ued, confirming-to him and his heirs all the privileges contained in the capitulation concluded at Santa Fe; his family was enobled, and the king, queen, and courtiers, treated him as a per&s;on of the highe&s;t rank. But what plea&s;ed him mo&s;t was an order to equip, without delay, an armanent of &s;uch force, as might enable him not only to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the countries he had already di&s;covered, but to go in &s;earch of tho&s;e more opulent regions, which he &s;till con|fidently expected to find.</P>
<P>Cautious as Ferdinand was, and aver&s;e to every thing new and adventurous, pre|parations for a &s;econd expediton were carried on with a rapidity unu&s;ual in Spain, and to an extent that would be deemed not incon&s;iderable in the pre&s;ent age. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen &s;hips, &s;ome of which were of good bur|then.

Every thing being ready, Columbus &s;et &s;ail from the bay of Cadiz on the 25th of September, 1493, and arrived at Hi&s;pan|iola on the 22d of November. When he appeared off Navidad, from the &s;tation in which he had left the thirty-eight men under the command or Arada, he was a&s;toni&s;hed that none of them appeared, and expected every moment to &s;ee them runing with tran&s;ports of joy to welcome their countrymen. But he &s;oon found, that the imprudent and licentious beha|viour of his men had rou&s;ed the re&s;ent|ment of the natives, who at la&s;t de&s;troyed them all and burned their fort.</P>
<P>He then traced out the plan of a town in a large plain, near a &s;pacious bay, and obliged every per&s;on to put his hand to a work on which their common &s;afety de|pended.

<P>His followers loudly complained of be|ing obliged to turn builders, where they expected to meet with riches and luxuries.

<P>Columbus employed &s;everal months in marching through the i&s;land, and in &s;ub|jecting it to the Spani&s;h government, without meeting with any oppo&s;ition. He impo&s;ed a tribute upon all the inhabitants above fourteen years of age.

This was the fir&s;t regular taxation of the Indians, and &s;erved as a precedent for exactions, &s;till more exorbitant. Such an impo&s;ition was extremely contrary to tho&s;e maxims which Columbus had hitherto inculcated, with re&s;pect to the mode of treating them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="025348_0055_0FCD008402308048">
The condition of the Indians became in&s;upportable, and they endeavoured to &s;tarve the Spaniards, by de&s;troying all the produce of the earth, and then retired to the mountains. This reduced the Span|iards to extreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> but they received &s;uch &s;ea&s;onable &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of provi&s;ions from Europe, and found &s;o many re&s;ources in their ingenuity and indu&s;try, that they &s;uffered no great lo&s;s of men.</P>
<P>Columbus finding he had many ene|mies in the court of Spain, re&s;olved to return home in order to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, leaving his brother Bartholomew as lieut. governor, and Francis Roldon chief ju&s;|tice. He was received at court, on his arrival, with &s;o many marks of approba|tion, after having perfectly cleared up his conduct, as made his enemies a&s;hamed of them&s;elves, and it was re&s;olved to &s;end him on di&s;coveries a third time.</P>
<P>After innumerable di&s;appointments and delays, he &s;ailed on his third voyage on the 30th day of May, 1398. His &s;qua|dron con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix &s;hips only, of no great burden, and but indifferently provi|ded for &s;o long and dangerous a naviga|tion.</P>
<P>He &s;ailed in a different direction to what he had hitherto done, in order to fall in with the coa&s;t of India. On the 1&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="025348_0056_0FCD008615463E48">of Augu&s;t, the man &s;tationed in the round top, &s;urprized them with the joy|ful cry of <HI>land.</HI> They &s;tood towards it and di&s;covered a con&s;iderable i&s;land, which the admiral called Trinid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, a name it &s;till retains. He did not arrive at Hi&s;|paniola till the 30th of Augu&s;t, when he found the affairs of the colony in &s;uch a &s;ituation as afforded him no pro&s;pect of enjoying that repo&s;e, of which he &s;tood &s;o much in need.</P>
<P>Many revolutions had happened in that country during his ab&s;ence. His brother, the deputy governor, in con&s;e|quence of the advice the admiral gave him before his departure, had removed the colony from I&s;abella to a more commod|ious &s;tation, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land, and laid the foundation of St. Do|mingo. The natives were &s;oon after re|duced to the Spani&s;h yoke, which ap|peared &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive to them, that they ro&s;e in their own defence, but were ea&s;ily conquered. At the &s;ame time, Roldon, whom Columbus had placed in a &s;tation, which required him to be the guardian of order and tranquility, per&s;uaded the colo|ny to ri&s;e in arms.</P>
<P>Such was the di&s;tracted &s;tate of the co|lony when Columbus arrived at St. Do|mingo, but his wi&s;dom and moderation &s;oon brought every thing to order.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="025348_0053_0FCD008103405238">
While Columbus was thus engaged in the we&s;t, the &s;pirit of di&s;covery did not langui&s;h in Portugal. Emmanuel, who inherited the enterprizing genius of his predece&s;&s;ors, per&s;i&s;ted in their grand &s;cheme of opening a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndies by the Cape of Good Hope, and &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne he equiped a &s;quadron for that important voyage. He gave the command of it to Va&s;co de Gama, a man of noble birth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue, prudence, and cou|rage, equal to the &s;tation. The &s;quadron like all tho&s;e &s;ited out for di&s;covery in the infancy of navigation, was extremely feeble, con&s;i&s;ting only of three ve&s;&s;els, of neither burthen nor force adequate to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He &s;et &s;ail from Li&s;bon on the 9th of July, 1497, and &s;tanding towards the South, had to &s;truggle for four months with contrary winds, before he could reach the Cape of Good Hope: Here their violence began to abate, and during an interval of calm weather, in the latter end of November, Gama doubled that formidable promontory, which had &s;o long been the boundary of navigation, and directed his cour&s;e towards the northea&s;t, along the African coa&s;t. He touched at &s;everal ports, and after various adventures
<PB N="44" REF="025348_0054_0FCD00827B56DF48">came to an anchor before the city of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|leida. Gama now pur&s;ued his voyage with almo&s;t ab&s;olute certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, and under the conduct of a Mahome an pilot he arrived at Calecut, upon the coa&s;t of Malabar, on the 22d of May, 1498.</P>
<P>What he beheld of the wealth, the po|pulou&s;ne&s;s, the cultivation, the indu&s;try, and arts of this highly civilized country, far exceeded any idea that he had formed from the imperfect accounts which the Europeans had hitherto received of it. But as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither &s;ufficient force to attempt a &s;ettlement, nor proper com|modities with which he could carry on commerce of any con&s;equence, he ha&s;t|ened back to Portugal, with an account of his &s;ucce&s;s in performing a voyage the longe&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t difficult, that had ever been made &s;ince the fir&s;t inven|tion of navigation. He landed at Li&s;bon on the 14th of September, 1499, two years, two months, and five days from the time he left that port.</P>
<P>Amerigo Ve&s;pucci, a Florentine gentle|man, having accompanied Ojeda in a voyage to the new world, on his return tran&s;mited an account of his adventures and di&s;coveries to one of his countrymen, and labouring with the vanity of a trav|eller to magnify his own exploits, he had
<PB N="45" REF="025348_0057_0FCD008862B55C58">the addre&s;s and confidence to frame his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ative, &s;o as to make it appear, that he had the glory of having fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed the continent in the new world. The country, of which Amerigo was &s;uppo|&s;ed to be di&s;coverer, came gradually to be called by his name. By the univer&s;al con&s;ent of nations, America is the name be&s;towed on this new quarter of the globe. The bold preten&s;ions of a fortunate im|po&s;tor have robbed the di&s;coverer of the new world of a di&s;tinction which belong|ed to him. The name of Amerigo has &s;upplanted that of Columbus, and it is now too late to redre&s;s the injury.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t year of the fourteenth century, Pedro Alvarez Cabral was fitted out by the king of Portugal in order to carry on trade or attempt conque&s;ts in India, to which place Gama had ju&s;t &s;hewn them the way. In order to avoid the coa&s;t of Africa, where he was certain of meeting with variable breezes, or fre|quent calms, which might retard his voyage, Cabral &s;tood out to &s;ea, and kept &s;o far to the we&s;t, that, to his &s;urprize, he found him&s;elf upon the &s;hore of an un|known country, in the tenth degree be|yond the line. The country with which he fell in belongs to that province in South America, now known by the name of
<PB N="46" REF="025348_0058_0FCD0089377F0418">Bra&s;il. He landed, and having formed a very high idea of the fertility of the &s;oil, and agreeablene&s;s of the climate, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the crown of Portugal. and di&s;patched a &s;hip to Li&s;bon with an account of this event, which appeared to be no le&s;s important than it was unexpect|ed.</P>
<P>While the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e were daily acquiring more enlarged ideas of the extent and opulence of that quar|ter of the globe which Columbus had made known to them, he him&s;elf, far from enjoying the tranquility and honors, with which his &s;ervices &s;hould have been recompen&s;ed, was &s;trugling with every di&s;tre&s;s, in which the envy and malevo|lence of the people under his command, or the ingratitude of the court which he &s;erved could involve him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the court of Spain became prejudiced again&s;t Columbus, a fatal re|&s;olution was taken. Francis de Bovadilla, a knight of Calatrava, was appointed to repair to Hi&s;paniola, with full powers to enquire into the conduct of Columbus; and, if he &s;hould find the charge of mal|admini&s;tration proved, to &s;upercede him, and a&s;&s;ume the government of the i&s;land, It was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape when this pre|po&s;terous commi&s;&s;ion, made it the intere&s;t
<PB N="47" REF="025348_0059_0FCD008AC0381378">the judge to pronounce the per&s;on, whom he was &s;ent to try, guilty of every charge. What followed cannot at all appear &s;ur|prizing; Columbus was &s;ent to Spain loaded with chains. Fortunately, his voyage to Spain was extremely &s;hort, where he arrived on the 23d of Novem|ber, 1500.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Ferdinand and I&s;abella, were informed that Columbus was brought home a pri&s;oner, and in chains, they were a&s;hamed of their conduct and dreaded the cen&s;ure of all Europe. They in&s;tantly i&s;&s;ued orders to &s;et Columbus at liberty, invited him to court, and remited him money to enable him to appear there in a manner &s;uitable to his rank. On his ap|pearance at court, the mode&s;t manner in which he told his tale, and related his grievances, were felt by every one, the new governor of Hi&s;paniola was recalled, and Ovando was &s;ent in his room.</P>
<P>While the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps were taking for &s;ecuring the pro&s;perity and welfare of the colony which Columbus had planted, he him&s;elf was engaged in the unplea&s;ant employment of &s;oliciting the favour of an ungrateful court, and notwith&s;tanding all his merit and &s;ervices he &s;olicited in vain. After attending the court of Spain for near two years, as an humble &s;uitor, he
<PB N="48" REF="025348_0060_0FCD008CAB6C5928">found it impo&s;&s;ible to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehen&s;ions, and perceiv|ed at length, that he laboured in vain, when he urged a claim of ju&s;tice or merit with an intere&s;ted, ungenerous, and un|feeling prince.</P>
<P>However, Columbus, at la&s;t, prevailed on the court of Spain to fit him out on his fourth expedition, which they were per&s;uaded to embark in, on the promi&s;ed hope of his finding out a &s;horter and &s;afer route to the Ea&s;t Indies. He accordingly &s;ailed from Cadiz, on the 9th of May, 1502, with only four &s;mall barks, the large&s;t of which did not exceed &s;eventy tons in burthen. On his arrival at Hi&s;|paniola, he met with the mo&s;t ungener|ous treatment from Ovando, who would not &s;uffer him to enter their harbours.</P>
<P>After various and fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age to the Indian ocean, Columbus met with all the di&s;a&s;ters to which navigation is expo&s;ed. Furious hurricanes, with violent &s;torms or thun|der and lightning, threatened his de&s;truc+tion, and at la&s;t drove him on the coa&s;t of Jamaica, where his little crazy fleet was wrecked, on the 24th of June, 1503.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of Columbus in this &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ua+tion was truly lamentable, but his genius ro&s;e above every thing. He &s;upported

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE colony of Hi&s;paniola, before the death of Columbus, had gradually acquired the form of a regular and pro&s;perous &s;tate. The humane &s;olicitude of I&s;abella to protect the indians from oppre&s;&s;ion, and particular|ly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel them to work, for &s;ome time, it is true, retarded the pro|gre&s;s of improvement. The natives con&s;id|ering every exemption from toil as a &s;upreme felicity, de&s;pi&s;ed every allurement and re|ward by which they were invited to labour. The Spaniards were not numerous enough, either to work the mines or cultivate the &s;oil, the di&s;tempers peculiar to the climate hav|ing carried off great numbers.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ave the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the rigour of &s;ome royal edicts that had been &s;ent to him. He made a new di&s;tribution of the indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them to labour for a &s;tated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the grounds; but in order to &s;crene him&s;elf from the imputa|tion of having &s;ubjected them again to &s;erv|itude, he enjoined their ma&s;ters to pay them a certain &s;um, as the price of their work. But the indians, after enjoying re&s;pite from oppre&s;&s;ion, though during a &s;hort interval,
<PB N="52" REF="025348_0065_0FCD0096110EF568">now found the yoke of bondage to be &s;o galling, that they made &s;everal attempts to vindicate their own liberty. However they were &s;ubdued as often as they ro&s;e, and the treatment they received from Ovando was both cruel and treacherous.</P>
<P>The attention of the Spaniards was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by their operations in the mines of Hi&s;paniola, that the &s;pirit of di&s;|covery langui&s;hed for &s;ome time. In 1508 Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded un|der Ovando, in the ea&s;tern di&s;trict of Hi&s;|paniola, pa&s;&s;ed over to the i&s;land of St. Ju|an de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had di&s;covered in his &s;econd voyage, and pene|trated into the interior parts of the country. As he found the &s;oil to be fertile, and ex|pected, from &s;ymptoms, as well as from the information of the inhabitants, to di&s;cover mines of gold in the mountains, Ovando permited him to attempt making a &s;ettle|ment in the i&s;land. In a few years, Puerto Rico was &s;ubjected to the Spani&s;h govern|ment, the natives were reduced to &s;ervitude, and being treated with the &s;ame incon&s;iderate rigor as their neighbors in Hi&s;paniola, the race of original inhabitants worn out with fatigue and &s;ufferings, was &s;oon exterminated.</P>
<P>Seba&s;tian de Ocampo, by the command of Ovando, &s;ailed round Cuba, and fir&s;t di&s;co|vered, with certainty, that this country,
<PB N="53" REF="025348_0066_0FCD0097F4DF4F10">which Columbus once &s;uppo&s;ed to be a part of the continent was only a large i&s;land.</P>
<P>This voyage round Cuba was one of the la&s;t occurrences under the admini&s;tration of Ovando. Ever &s;ince the death of Columbus, his &s;on Don Diego had been employed in &s;oliciting Ferdinand to grant him the offices of Viceroy and Admiral in the New World, together with all the other immunities and profits which de&s;cended to him by in|heritance, in con&s;equence of the original capitulation with his father. But if the&s;e dignities and revenues appeared &s;o con&s;ider|able to Ferdinand, that, at the expence of being deemed unju&s;t, as well as ungrateful, he had wre&s;ted them from Columbus, it is not &s;urprizing that he &s;hould be unwil|ling to confer them on his &s;on. Accord|ingly Don Diego wa&s;ted two years in ince&s;|&s;ant but fruitle&s;s importunity. Weary of this, he endeavoured at length to obtain, by a legal &s;entence, what he could not pro|cure from the favour of an intere&s;ted mo|narch. He commenced a &s;uit again&s;t Ferd|inand before the council which managed in|dian affairs, and that court with an integrity which reflects honour upon its proceedings, decided again&s;t the king, and confirmed all the privileges &s;tipulated in the capitulation. Ferdinand &s;till &s;hewed his repugnance to do Diego ju&s;tice, nor would he at la&s;t have done any thing had he not been in a manner forc|ed
<PB N="54" REF="025348_0067_0FCD00992E521010">to it by a powerful party, rai&s;ed in con&s;e|quence of the marriage of Don Diego with Donna Maria, daughter of Don Ferdinand, great commendator of Leon, and brother of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of the fir&s;t rank and nearly related to the king. The duke and his family e&s;pou&s;ed &s;o warmly the cau&s;e of their new ally, that Ferdinand could not re&s;i&s;t their &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>In 1509, he recalled Ovando, and ap|pointed Don Diego his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though even in conferring this favour he could not conceal his jealou&s;y; for he allowed him to a&s;&s;ume only the title of governor and not that of vice-roy.</P>
<P>Don Diego immediately &s;et off for Hi&s;|paniola, attended by his brother, his uncle, his wife, whom the courte&s;y of the Span|iards honoured with the title of Vicequeen, and a numerous retinue of both &s;exes, born of good families. He lived with a &s;plendor and magnificence hitherto unknown in the new world, and the family of Columbus &s;eemed now to enjoy the honors and rewards due to his inventive genius of which he him|&s;elf had been cruelly defrauded. The colo|ny it&s;elf acquired new lu&s;tre by the acce&s;|&s;ion of &s;o many inhabitants of a different rank and character from mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had hitherto emigrated to America, and ma|ny of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements are de&s;cended from the
<PB N="55" REF="025348_0068_0FCD009A936BC188">per&s;ons who at that time accompanied Don Diego Columbus.</P>
<P>Juan Diaz de Solis, about this time &s;et out in conjunction with Pinzon, upon new di&s;|coveries. They &s;ailed due &s;outh, towards the equinoxial line, which Pinzon had for|merly cro&s;&s;ed, and advanced as far as the 40th degree of &s;outhern latitude. They were a&s;toni&s;hed to find that the continent of America &s;tretched on the right hand, thro' all this va&s;t extent of ocean. They landed in different places, to taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the name of their &s;overeign; but though the country appeared to be extremely fertile and inviting, their force was &s;o &s;mall, having been fited out rather for di&s;covery than mak|ing &s;ettlements, that they left no colony be|hind them Their voyage however, &s;erved to give the Spaniards more exalted and ade|quate ideas, with re&s;pect ta the dimen&s;ions of the new world.</P>
<P>Private adventurers attempted to make &s;ettlements on the new continent; but the lo&s;s of their &s;hips by various accidents upon unknown coa&s;ts, the di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to a climate the mo&s;t noxious in all America, the want of provi&s;ions, unavoidable in a country imperfectly cultivated, di&s;&s;entions among them&s;elves, and the ince&s;&s;ant ho&s;til|ities of the natives, involved them in a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of calamities, the bare recital of which would &s;trike my readers with horror.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="025348_0069_0FCD009BF8299040">
Notwith&s;tanding the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of this expedition, the Spaniards were not de|terred from engaging in new &s;chemes of a &s;imilar nature. Juan Ponce de Leon, in 1512, fitted out three &s;hips at his own ex|pence, for a voyage of di&s;covery, and his reputation &s;oon drew together a re&s;pectable body of followers. He directed his cour&s;e towards the Lucayo i&s;lands; and, after touching at &s;everal of them, as well as of the Bahama i&s;les, he &s;tood to the South|we&s;t, and di&s;covered a country hitherto un|known to the Spaniards, which he called Florida, either becau&s;e he fell in with it on Palm Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful appearance. He attempted to land in different places, but met with &s;uch vigorous oppo&s;ition from the natives, who were fierce and warlike, as convinced him, that an encrea&s;e of force was requi&s;ite to effect a &s;ettlement. Satisfied with having opened a communication with a new coun|try, of who&s;e value and importance he con|cieved very &s;anguine hopes, he returned to Puerto Rico, through the channel now known by the name of the Gulf of Florida.</P>
<P>Soon after the expedition to Florida, a di&s;covery of much greater importance was made in another part of America, Balboa, having been rai&s;ed to the government of the &s;mall colony at Santa Maria in Darien, made frequent inroads into the adjacent
<PB N="57" REF="025348_0070_0FCD009EF9853C28">country, and collected a con&s;iderable quan|tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the continent than in the i&s;lands. In one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, the Spaniards con|tended with &s;uch eagerne&s;s about the divi|&s;ion of &s;ome gold, that they were at the point of proceeding to acts of violence a|gain&s;t one another. A young Indian prince, who was pre&s;ent, a&s;toni&s;hed at the high value they &s;et upon a thing, of which he did not di&s;cern the u&s;e, tumbled the gold out of the balance with indignation, and, turning to the Spaniards, "Why do you quarrel," (&s;aid he) "about &s;uch a trifle? If you are to pa&s;&s;ionately fond of gold, as to abandon your own country, and to di&s;|turb the tranquility of di&s;tant nations for its &s;ake, I will conduct you to a region, where this metal, which &s;eems to be the chief object of your admiration and de&s;ire, is &s;o common, that the meane&s;t uten&s;ils are formed of it."</P>
<P>Balboa and his companions, tran&s;ported with what they heard, eagerly enquired where this happy country lay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and how they might arrive at it. He informed them, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix &s;uns, that is, of &s;ix days journey towards the South, they &s;hould di&s;cover another ocean, near to which this wealthy kingdom was &s;ituated; but, if they intended to attack that powerful &s;tate, they mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble forces far &s;uperior in number
<PB N="58" REF="025348_0071_0FCD00A08A3FBFB0">and &s;trength to what they were at pre&s;ent. This was the fir&s;t information which the Spaniards received concerning the &s;outhern ocean, or the opulent and exten&s;ive country known afterwards by the name of Peru.</P>
<P>Balboa, having mu&s;tered all the forces he could, which amounted only to 190 men, &s;et out on this important expedition on the fir&s;t of September, 1513, about the time that the periodical rains began to abate. Though their guides had repre&s;ented the breadth of the i&s;tmus to be only a journey of &s;ix days, they had already &s;pent twenty five in forcing their way through the woods and mountains. Many of them were ready to &s;ink under &s;uch fatigue in that &s;ultry cli|mate, &s;everal were &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to the country, and all became im|patient to reach the period of their labors and &s;ufferings. At length the indians a&s;&s;ur|ed them, that from the top of the next mountain they &s;hould di&s;cover the ocean which was the object of their wi&s;hes. When with infinite toil they had climbed up the greater part of that &s;teep a&s;cent, Balboa commanded his men to halt and advanced alone to the &s;ummit, that he might be the fir&s;t who &s;hould enjoy &s;uch a &s;pectacle which he had &s;o long de&s;ired. As &s;oon as he be|held the South Sea &s;tretching in endle&s;s pro&s;pect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, returned
<PB N="59" REF="025348_0072_0FCD00A24BAD5D58">thanks to God, who had conducted him to a di&s;covery, &s;o beneficial to his country, and &s;o honorable to him&s;elf. His followers, ob&s;erving his tran&s;ports of joy, ru&s;hed for|ward to join his wonder, exultation and gra|titude. They held on their cour&s;e to the &s;hore, with great alacrity, when Balboa ad|vancing up to the middle in the waves, with his buckler and &s;word, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that ocean in the name of the king his ma&s;|ter, and vowed to defend it.</P>
<P>That part of the great Pacific or South|ern ocean, which Balboa fir&s;t di&s;covered, &s;till retains the name of the Gulf of St. Michael, which he gave to it, and is &s;itu|ated to the ea&s;t of Panama. From &s;everal of the petty princes, who governed in the di&s;tricts adjacent to that gulf, he extorted provi&s;ions and gold by force of arms; others &s;ent them to him voluntarily. To|gether with the acqui&s;ition of this wealth, which &s;erved to &s;oothe and encourage his followers, he received accounts which con+firmed his &s;anguine hopes of future and more exten&s;ive benefits from this expedition. All the people on the coa&s;ts of the South Sea concurred in informing him, that there was a mighty and opulent kingdom &s;ituated at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance towards the &s;outh|ea&s;t, where gold was found in plenty.</P>
<P>Though the information Balboa received from the people, on the coa&s;t, as well as
<PB N="60" REF="025348_0073_0FCD00A38011DA50">his own conjectures and hopes, made him extremely impatient to vi&s;it this unknown country, his prudence re&s;trained him from attempting to invade it with a handful of men, exhau&s;ted by fatigue, and weakened by di&s;ea&s;es. He determined to lead back his followers to their &s;ettlement at Santa Maria in Darien, and to return next &s;ea&s;on with a force more adequate to &s;uch an ardu|ous enterprize. He reached Santa Maria after an ab&s;ence of four months, with greater glory and more trea&s;ure, than the Spaniards ever had acquired in any former expedition in the New World.</P>
<P>He took care to acquaint the court of Spain with the important di&s;covery he had made and demanded a reinforcment of a thou&s;and men, in order to attempt the con|que&s;t of that opulent country, concerning which he had received &s;uch inviting intelli|gence.</P>
<P>The meanne&s;&s;es and jealou&s;ies of Ferdi|nand, and the advice of men around him wor&s;e than him&s;elf, induced him to &s;uper|cede Balboa, the mo&s;t proper man he could have employed, and to appoint Pedrarias Davila governor of Darien. He gave him the command of fourteen &s;tout ve&s;&s;els, and twelve hundred &s;oldiers. The&s;e were fitted out at the public expence, and granted with a liberality unu&s;ual to Ferdinand.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="025348_0074_0FCD00A5971A3AF8">
Perdrarias reached the gulf at Darien without any remarkable accident in July, 1514; but his ill conduct, and ba&s;e treat|ment of Balboa, &s;topped all operations, and nearly ruined this flouri&s;hing colony. Both parties &s;ent home complaints to Spain again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>At length, Ferdinand, became &s;en&s;ible of his imprudence in &s;uperceeding the mo&s;t active and experienced officer he had in the New World, and, by way of compen&s;ation to Balboa, he appointed him lieutenant-governor of the countries upon the South Sea, with very exten&s;ive privileges and au|thority, at the &s;ame time ordering Pedra|rias to &s;upport him in all his operations, and to con&s;ult him on every mea&s;ure which he him&s;elf pur&s;ued. Surely nothing could be more ridiculous and ab&s;urd in Ferdinand than this conduct! Pedrarias now conceived the mo&s;t implacable hatred to Balboa, and, though he afterwards &s;eemed &s;o far 1 con|ciled to him, as to give him his daughter in marriage, he &s;oon found means fal&s;ely to accu&s;e him of high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;on, had him tried, condemned, and publicly executed in 1517. Pedrarias, notwith&s;tanding the violence and inju&s;tice of his proceedings, was not only &s;creened from puni&s;hment by the powerful patronage of the infamous bi&s;hop of Bur|gos, an inveterate enemy to real merit, but continued in the government.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="025348_0075_0FCD00A740098968">
While matters were thus going forward in Darien, &s;everal important events occur|red with re&s;pect to the di&s;covery, the conque&s;t, and government of other provin|ces in the New World. Ferdinand was &s;o intent upon opening a communication with the Molucca or Spice I&s;lands by the we&s;t, that, in the year 1515, he fitted out two &s;hips at his own expence, in order to at|tempt &s;uch a voyage, and gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful navigators in Spain. He &s;tood along the coa&s;t of South America, and on the fir&s;t of January. 1516, he entered a river which he called Janeiro, where an exten&s;ive commerce is now carried on. From thence he proceed|ed to a &s;pacious bay which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the entrance into a &s;trait that commu|nicated with the indian ocean; but upon advancing farther, he found it to be the mouth of Rio de Plata, one of the va&s;t rivers by which the &s;outhern continent of America is watered. In endeavoring to make a de&s;cent in this county, De Sollis and &s;everal of his crew were &s;lain by the natives; who, in &s;ight of the &s;hips, cut their bodies in pieces, roa&s;ted and devour|ed them. Di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s of their commander and terrified at this horrid &s;pec|tacle, the &s;urviving Spaniards &s;et &s;ail for Europe, without aiming at any further di&s;|covery.
<PB N="63" REF="025348_0076_0FCD00A8DA7FE3C8">Though this attempt proved abor|tive it was not without benefit: it turned the attention of ingenious men to this cour&s;e of navigation, and prepared the way for a more fortunate voyage.</P>
<P>While di&s;coveries were thus going for|ward. Hi&s;paniola continued as their principal colony, and the &s;eat of government. Don Diego Columbus wanted neither inclina|tion or abilities to have rendered the mem|bers of this colony, who were mo&s;t imme|diately under his direction, pro&s;perous and happy; but he was circum&s;cribed in all his operations by the &s;u&s;picious policy of Ferdi|nand, who on every occa&s;ion, and under the mo&s;t frivolous pretexts, retrenched his privileges, and encouraged the trea&s;urer, the judges, and other &s;ubordinate officers, to counteract his mea&s;ures, and to di&s;pute his authority. In &s;hort, Ferdinand's con|duct was &s;o ungenerous, as obliged Don Diego to quit Hi&s;paniola, and repair to Spain, in order to &s;eek redre&s;s for his in|juries</P>
<P>On the death of Ferdinand, in 1517, Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> V. took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment. Diego Vela&s;quez, who conquered Cuba in the year 1511, &s;till retained the government of that i&s;land, as the deputy of Don Diego Columbus, though he &s;eldom acknowledged his &s;uperior, and aimed at rendering his own authority altogether inde|pendent.
<PB N="64" REF="025348_0077_0FCD00AAB8C3AD60">Under his prudent admini&s;tration, Cuba became one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. The fame of this drew many per&s;ons from the other colonies, expecting there to find &s;ome permanent e&s;|tabli&s;hment, or &s;ome employment for their activity As Cuba lay to the we&s;t of all the i&s;lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, and as the ocean which &s;tretches beyond it tow|ards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, the&s;e circum&s;tances-naturally in|vited the inhabitants to attempt new di&s;|coveries.</P>
<P>An expedition for this purpo&s;e in which activity and re&s;olution might conduct to &s;ud|den wealth, was more &s;uited to the genius of the age, than the patient indu&s;try requi|&s;ite in clearing ground, and manufacturing &s;ugar. Hence it happened, that &s;everal officers who had &s;erved under Pedrarias in Darien, entered into an a&s;&s;ociation to un|dertake a voyage of di&s;covery. They per|&s;uaded Franci&s;co Hernandez Cordova an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of great courage, to join with them in the ad|venture, and cho&s;e him to be their comman|der. Veia&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ez not only approved of the de&s;ign, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying it on.</P>
<P>Three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were purcha&s;ed, and furni&s;hed with every thing requi&s;ite either for traffic or war. An hundred and ten men embarked on board them, and &s;ailed
<PB N="65" REF="025348_0078_0FCD00ABC104A690">from St. Jago de Cuba on the 8th of Feb|ruary, 1517.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t day after their depar|ture from St Jago, they &s;aw land which proved to be Cape Catoche, the ea&s;tern point of that large penin&s;ula projecting from the continent of America, which &s;till retains its original name of Yucatan. As they approached the &s;hore, five canoes came off full of people decently clad in cotton garments: an a&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing &s;ight to the Span|iards, who had found every other part of America po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by native &s;avages. Cor|dova endeavored by &s;mall pre&s;ents to gain the good will of the&s;e people. They, though amazed at the &s;trange objects now pre&s;ented for the fir&s;t time to their view, invited the Spaniards to vi&s;it their habitations, with an appearance of cordiality. They landed ac|cordingly, and as they advanced into the country, they ob&s;erved with new wonder &s;ome large hou&s;es built with &s;tone: but they &s;oon found, if the Yucatans had made progre&s;s in improvement beyond their countrymen, they were likewi&s;e more artful and warlike. Though the in|dian chief received Cordova with many tokens of friend&s;hip, he had po&s;ted a con|&s;iderable body of his &s;ubjects in ambu&s;h be|hind a thicket, who upon a &s;ignal given by him, ru&s;hed out and attacked the Spaniards with great boldne&s;s, and with &s;ome degree of
<PB N="66" REF="025348_0079_0FCD00ADD31FF348">martial order. At the fir&s;t flight of their arrows, fifteen of the Spaniards were woun|ded; but the indians were &s;o terrified with the &s;udden explo&s;ion of the fire arms, and &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at the execution done by them, by the cro&s;s bows, and by the other weap|ons of their new enemies, that they precip|itately fled. Cordova immediately quitted a country where he had met with &s;o unwel|come a reception, carrying off two pri&s;on|ers, with the ornaments of a &s;mall temple which he plundered in making his retreat to his &s;hip.</P>
<P>Cordova continued his cour&s;e towards the we&s;t without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the coa&s;t, and on the &s;ixteenth day arrived at Campeachy. At this place the natives received them more kindly; but the Spaniards were much &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that on all the exten&s;ive coa&s;t along which they had &s;ailed, they had not met with any river. Their water beginning to fail, they advanced in hope of finding a &s;upply; and at length they di&s;covered the mooth of a river.</P>
<P>Cordova landed all his troops in order to protect the &s;ailors, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to fill the ca&s;ks; but the natives ru&s;hed up|on them with &s;uch fury, and in &s;uch num|bers, that forty-&s;even of the Spaniards were killed upon the &s;pot, and one man on|ly of the whole body e&s;caped unhurt.&mdash; Their commander though wounded in
<PB N="67" REF="025348_0080_0FCD00AF36FE1C18">twelve different places, directed the retreat with pre&s;ence of mind equal to the courage with which he had led them on in the en|gagement, and with much difficulty they reached their &s;hips. Having met with this terrible repul&s;e, nothing remained but to ha&s;ten back to Cuba with their &s;hattered forces. In their pa&s;&s;age thither, they &s;uf|fered the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s from the want of water, that men wounded and &s;ickly, &s;hut up in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and expo&s;ed to the heat of the torrid zone, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uf|fer. Some died on their pa&s;&s;age and Cor|dova their commander, &s;oon after he landed at Cuba paid the debt of nature.</P>
<P>Unfortunate as this expedition proved, it contributed rather to animate than damp a &s;pi|rit of enterpr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ze among the Spaniards. They had di&s;covered an exten&s;ive country, &s;ituated in the neighborhood of Cuba, fertile in ap|pearance, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a people far more refined than any they had hitherto met with in America. Vela&s;quez, through particular views of ambition and intere&s;t, not only encouraged their ardor, but at his own ex|pen&s;e futed out four &s;hips for the voyage. Two hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were &s;everal per&s;ons of rank and for|tune, embarked in this enterpri&s;e. The command of it was given to Juan de Gri|jalva a young man of known merit and courage, with in&s;tructions attentively to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="68" REF="025348_0081_0FCD00B0411D9178">the nature of the countries which he &s;hould di&s;cover; to barter for gold; and, if circum&s;tances were inviting, to &s;ettle a col|ony in &s;ome proper &s;tation. He &s;ailed from St Jago de Cuba, on the 8th of April, 1518.</P>
<P>They held the &s;ame cour&s;e as in the former voyage, and at la&s;t reached Poton|chan, where the la&s;t adventurers had been &s;o roughly handled. The de&s;ire of avenging their countrymen who had been &s;lain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, that they might cha&s;tize the Indians with &s;uch exemplary rigour, as would &s;trike terror into all the people round them; but, though they di&s;|imbarked all their troops and carried a&s;hore &s;ome field pieces, the Indians fought with &s;uch courage, that the Spaniards with diffi|culty gained the victory: and were con|firmed in their opinion, that the inhabitants of this country would prove more formida|dable enemies than any they had met with in other parts of America.</P>
<P>From Potonchan, they continued their voyage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owards the we&s;t, keeping as near as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;hore, and ca&s;ting anchor every evening, from the dread of the dan|gerous accidents to which they might be expo&s;ed in an unknown &s;ea. During the day their eyes were turned continually to|wards land, with a mixture of &s;urprize and
<PB N="69" REF="025348_0082_0FCCDB8F8DB3C830">wonder at the beauty of the country, as well as the novelty of the objects they be|held. Many villages were &s;cattered along the coa&s;t, in which they could di&s;tingui&s;h hou&s;es of &s;tone that appeared white and lofty at a di&s;tance, One of the &s;oldiers happening to remark, that this country re|&s;embled Spain in its appearance. Grijalva, with univer&s;al applau&s;e, called it New Spain, the name which &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hes this ex|ten&s;ive and opulent province of Spani&s;h empire in America.</P>
<P>On the 9th of June, they landed in a river, which the natives called Taba&s;co, and the fame of their victory at Potonchan having reached this place, the chief not only received them amicably, but be&s;towed pre&s;ents upon them of &s;uch value, as con|firmed the highe&s;t ideas, which the Spaniards had formed, with re&s;pect to the wealth and fertility of the country&punc; The&s;e ideas were rai&s;ed &s;till higher, by what occurred at the place where they next touched. This was con&s;iderably to the we&s;t of Taba&s;co, in the province &s;ince known by the name of Guaxaca. There they were received with the re&s;pect due to &s;uperior beings. The people perfumed them as they landed with gum copal, and pre&s;ented to them as offer|ings the choiceff delicacies of their coun|try. They were extremely fond of trading with their new vi&s;itants, and in &s;ix days
<PB N="70" REF="025348_0083_0FCD00B3A50B17E0">he Spaniards obtained ornaments of gold, of curious workman&s;hip, to the value of fifteen thou&s;and pe&s;os, in exchange for European toys of &s;mall price. The two pri&s;oners, whom Cordavo had brought from Yucatan, had hitherto &s;erved as in|terpreters: but as they were unacquainted with the language of this country, the Span|iards learned from the natives by &s;igns, that they were the &s;ubjects of a great mon|arch, called Montezuma, who&s;e dominions extended over that and many other provin|ces.</P>
<P>Leaving this province, with which he had &s;o much rea&s;on to be contented, Grijalva continued his cour&s;e towards the we&s;t. He landed on a &s;mall i&s;land, which he named the I&s;le of Sacrifices, becau&s;e there the Spaniards beheld the horrid &s;pectacle of hu|man victims, which the barbarous &s;uper&s;ti|tions of the natives offered to their gods. He touched at another &s;mall i&s;land, which he called St. Juan de Ulua.</P>
<P>From this place he di&s;patched Predo de Alverado, one of his officers, to Vela&s;quez, with a full account of the important di&s;|coveries he had made, and with all the trea&s;ure that he had acquired by trafficking with the natives. After the departure of Alverado, he him&s;elf, with the remaining ve&s;&s;els, proceeded along the coa&s;t as far as the river Panuco, the country &s;till ap|pearing
<PB N="71" REF="025348_0084_0FCD00B4C05868D0">to be well peopled, fertile and op|ulent.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of &s;everal of Gri|jalva's officers, that it was not enough to have di&s;covered tho&s;e delightful regions, or to have performed, at their different landing-places, the empty ceremony of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them for the crown of Ca&s;tile, and that their glory was incom|plete, unle&s;s they planted a colony in &s;ome proper &s;tation which might not only &s;ecure the Spani&s;h nation a footing in the country; but with the reinforcements they were certain of receiving, might gradually &s;ub|ject the whole to the dominion of their &s;o|vereign. However, the &s;quadron had now been above &s;ix months at &s;ea, the greate part of their provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted, and what remained of their &s;tores &s;o much cor|rupted by the heat of the climate, as to be almo&s;t unfit for u&s;e; they had lo&s;t &s;ome men by death, and others were &s;ickly; the coun|try was crouded with people, who &s;eemed to be intelligent as well as brave, and they were under the government of one power|ful monarch, who could bring them to act again&s;t their invaders with united force. To plant a colony under &s;o many corre&s;pond|ing difficulties, appeared a matter too hazar|dous to be attempted. Though Grijalva was not without ambition and courage, yet he was de&s;titute of the &s;uperior abilities re|qui&s;ite
<PB N="72" REF="025348_0085_0FCD00B6D0E1EE10">to form and execute &s;o exten&s;ive a plan. He judged it more prudent to re|turn to Cuba, having fulfilled the pur|po&s;e of his voyage, and accompli&s;hed every thing, which the armament he commanded enabled him to perform. He returned to St. Jago de Cuba, on the 26th of Octo|ber, from whence he had &s;ailed about &s;ix months, without having met with any mate|rial accident.</P>
<P>As this was the longe&s;t, &s;o it had been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful voyage the Spaniards had hitherto made in the new world. They had di&s;covered that Yucatan was not an i&s;l|and as they had &s;uppo&s;ed, but part of the great continent of America. From Poton|chan they had pur&s;ued their cour&s;e for many hundred miles along a coa&s;t formerly unex|plored, &s;tretching at fir&s;t towards the we&s;t and then turning to the north. All the country they di&s;covered appeared to be no le&s;s valuable than exten&s;ive. As &s;oon as Avarado reached Cuba, Vela&s;quez, tran&s;|ported with &s;ucce&s;s &s;o far beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, immediately di&s;patch|ed a per&s;on of confidence to carry this im|portant intelligence to Spain; to exhibit the rich productions of the countries which had been di&s;covered by his means; and to &s;olicit &s;uch an increa&s;e of authority, as might enable and encourage him to attempt the conque&s;t of them. Without waiting
<PB N="73" REF="025348_0086_0FCD00B94CBE9E78">for the return of his me&s;&s;enger, or for the arrival of Grijalva, of whom he was be|come &s;o jealous or di&s;tru&s;tful that he re&s;ol|ved no longer to employ him, he began to prepare &s;uch a powerful armament, as might prove equal to an enterpri&s;e of &s;o much danger and importance. The little and mean jealou&s;ies, which the Spaniards &s;eem naturally to entertain of every man of merit, is a very &s;ingular blemi&s;h in the char|acter of that nation.</P>
<P>The expedition for which Vela&s;quez was now preparing with &s;o much ardour and activity, had in its views conque&s;ts far be|yond what the Spani&s;h nation had hitherto accompli&s;hed. It led them to the knowl|edge of a people, who, if compared with tho&s;e tribes of South America, and the We&s;t Indies, with whom they were hither|to acquainted, were infinitely more civilized, and far better acquainted with the arts of war and the &s;ciences in general. Before we proceed to the hi&s;tory of events extreme+ly different from tho&s;e we have already related, it may not be improper to take a view of the &s;tate of the New World, &s;uch as it was when fir&s;t di&s;covered, and to contemplate the policies and manners of the rude uncultivated tribes, by whom the differ|ent parts of it were occupied, and with whom the Spaniards at this time had inter|cour&s;e. This &s;hall be the &s;ubject of our next chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE immen&s;e extent of the New World is a circum&s;tance that &s;trikes us with wonder. America is remarkable, not only for its magnitude, but for its po&s;ition. It &s;tretches from the northern polar circle to a high &s;outhern latitude, above fifteen hundred miles beyond the furthe&s;t extrem|ity of the old continent on that &s;ide of the line. Next to its extent, the grandeur of the objects which it pre&s;ents to our view is mo&s;t apt to &s;trike the eye of an ob&s;erver. Nature &s;eems to have carried on her opera|tions upon a larger &s;cale, with a bolder hand, and to have di&s;tingui&s;hed the features of this country by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much &s;upe|rior in height to tho&s;e in the other divi&s;ions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito, which may be con&s;idered as the ba&s;e of the Andes, is elevated farther above the &s;ea, than the top of the Pyrenees. From tho&s;e lofty mountains de&s;cend rivers proportion|ably large, with which the &s;treams in the ancient continent are not to be compared, either for length of cour&s;e, or the va&s;t body of water, which they roll towards the ocean. Their lakes are no le&s;s con&s;picu|ous for grandeur than their mountains and
<PB N="76" REF="025348_0089_0FCD00BE057D3E30">rivers. They may be properly termed is|land &s;eas of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>The temperature of the climate of A|merica, and the different laws to which it is &s;ubject with re&s;pect to the di&s;tribution of heat and cold, are marks which particular|ly di&s;tingui&s;h it from other parts of the earth. Throughout all the&s;e va&s;t regions, there were only two monarchies remarka|ble for extent of territory, or di&s;tingui&s;hed by any progre&s;s in improvement. The re&s;t of their continent was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;mall independent tribes, de&s;titute of arts and indu&s;try, and neither capable to correct the defects, nor de&s;irous to meliorate the condition of that part of the earth allotted to them for their habitation. Countries, occupied by &s;uch people, were almo&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tate as if they had been without in|habitants.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t extent of A|merica, and the variety of its climates, the different &s;pecies of animals peculiar to it are much fewer in proportion, than tho&s;e of the other hemi&s;phere. In the i&s;lands, there are only four kinds of quadrupeds known, the large&s;t of which did not ex|ceed the &s;ize of a rabbit. On the conti|nent, the variety was greater; and though the individuals of each kind could not fail of multiplying exceedingly, when almo&s;t unmole&s;ted by men, who were neither &s;o
<PB N="77" REF="025348_0090_0FCD00BF49FAE6B0">numerous, nor &s;o united in &s;ociety, as to be formidable enemies to the animal crea|tion, yet the number of di&s;tinct &s;pecies mu&s;t be con&s;idered as extremely &s;mall.</P>
<P>To the cau&s;es, which checked the growth and vigour of the more noble animals, may be attributed the propagation and increa&s;e of reptiles and infects. The air is often darkened with clouds of in&s;ects, and the ground covered with &s;hocking and noxious reptiles.</P>
<P>The American birds of the torrid zone, like tho&s;e of the &s;ame climate in A&s;ia and Africa, are decked in plumage, which dazzles the eye with the beauty of its col|ours; but nature, &s;atisfied with clothing them in this gay dre&s;s, has denied mo&s;t of them that melody of &s;ound, and variety of notes, which catch and delight the ear. Let my youthful readers &s;top here, and pau&s;e for a while; through all the conditions and circum&s;tances of life, they will find, on reflection, that the hand of Providence has di&s;tributed things more equally than they are aware of, as well in the human, as in the feathered race.</P>
<P>In a continent &s;o exten&s;ive as America, the nature of the &s;oil mu&s;t be various. In each of its provinces, we find &s;ome di&s;tin|gui&s;hing peculiarity, the de&s;cription of which belongs to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e who write their particular
<PB N="78" REF="025348_0091_0FCD00C176E3B648">hi&s;tory, and would be an idle attempt to de&s;cribe in this epitome.</P>
<P>How America was fir&s;t peopled, by what cour&s;e mankind migrated from one continent to the other, and in what quarter it is mo&s;t probable the communication was fir&s;t opened between them, are matters for which we have little grounds to go upon beyond that of conjecture. The theories and &s;peculations of ingenious men, with re&s;pect to this &s;ubject, would fill many volumns; but they are often &s;o wild and chimerical, that it would be offering an in&s;ult to the under&s;tanding of our readers, to attempt either to enumerate or refute them, even provided the limits of this work would admit of it.</P>
<P>To enquire into the character and con|dition of the American nations, at the time when they became known to the Eu|ropeans, de&s;erves more attentive con&s;idera|tion, than the enquiry concerning their original. The di&s;covery of the New World enlarged the &s;phere of contempla|tion, and pre&s;ented nations to our view in a &s;tate very rude and uncultivated.. The greater part of the inhabitants were &s;tran|gers to indu&s;try and labor, ignorant of arts, imperfectly acquainted with the nature of property, and enjoying almo&s;t without re|&s;triction or controul the ble&s;&s;ings which flowed &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the bounty of
<PB N="79" REF="025348_0092_0FCD00C24D54B840">nature. Among the &s;mall independent tribes of South America, their cu&s;toms, manners and in&s;titututions, were nearly &s;imilar, and &s;o extremely rude, that the de|nomination of <HI>&s;avages</HI> may be applied to them all. The Spaniards who fir&s;t vi&s;ited America, and who had opportunity of be|holding its various tribes, while entire and un&s;ubdued, were far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the qualities requi&s;ite for ob&s;erving the &s;triking &s;pectable pre&s;ented to their view. Neither the age in which they lived, nor the nation to which they belonged, had made &s;uch progre&s;s in true &s;cience, as in&s;pires enlarged and liberal &s;entiments. The conquerors of the New World were mo&s;tly illiterate ad|venturers, de&s;titute of all the ideas which &s;hould have directed them in contemplating objects, &s;o extremely different from tho&s;e with which they were acquainted. Sur|rounded continually with danger, or &s;truggling with hard&s;hips, they had little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s capacity, for any &s;pecula|tive enquiry. Eager to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a country of &s;uch extent and opulence, and happy in finding it occupied by inhab|itants &s;o incapable to defend it, they ha&s;tily pronounced them to be a wretched order of men, formed merely for &s;ervitude; and were more employed in computing the profits of their labour, than in enquir|ing into the operations of their minds,
<PB N="80" REF="025348_0093_0FCD00C3C2D73BE0">or the rea&s;on of their cu&s;toms and in&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P>The human body is le&s;s affected by climate than that of any other animal. Some ani+mals are confined to a particular region of the globe, and cannot exi&s;t beyond it; while others though they may be brought to bear the injuries of a foreign climate, cea&s;e to multiply when carried from their native air and &s;oil. Even &s;uch as &s;eem ca|pable of being naturalized in various cli+mates, feel the effect of every remove from their proper &s;tation, and gradually dwindle and degenerate from the vigor and perfection peculiar to their &s;pecies. Man is the only living creature, who&s;e frame is at once &s;o hardy and &s;o flexible, that he can &s;pread over the whole earth, become the inhabitant of every region, and thrive and multiply under every climate, though not without &s;ome attending inconven|iences.</P>
<P>The complexion of the Americans is of a reddi&s;h brown, nearly re&s;embling the col|our of copper&punc;Their per&s;ons are of a full &s;ize, extremely &s;trait, and well propor|tioned; but they are more remarkable for agility than &s;trength&punc;As the external form of the Americans leads us to &s;u&s;pect that there is &s;ome natural debility in their frame, the &s;mallne&s;s of their appetite for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d has been mentioned by many authors
<PB N="81" REF="025348_0094_0FCD00C5464D8298">as a confirmation of this &s;u&s;picion. The quantity of food which men con&s;ume varies according to the temperature of the climate in which they live, the degree of activity which they exert, and the natural vigor of their con&s;titutions. Under the enervating heat of the torrid zone, and where men pa&s;s their days in indolence and ea&s;e, they require le&s;s nouri&s;hment than the active inhabitants of temperate or cold countries.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the feeble make of the Americans, hardly any of them are defor|med, mutilated, or defective in any of their &s;en&s;es. All travellers have been &s;truck with this circum&s;tance, and have celebrated the uniform &s;ymmetry and perfection of their external figure.</P>
<P>In the &s;implicity of the &s;avage &s;tate, when man is not oppre&s;&s;ed with labour, or ener|vated by luxury, or di&s;quieted with care, we are apt to imagine that his life will flow on almo&s;t untroubled by di&s;ea&s;e or &s;uffering, until his days be terminated in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans, as well as among other rude people, per|&s;ons, who&s;e decrepid and &s;hrivelled forms &s;eem to indicate on extraordinary length of life; but as mo&s;t of them are unacquainted with the art of numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is pa&s;t, as they are im|provident for what is to come, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="82" REF="025348_0095_0FCD00C8DA4140A0">to a&s;certain their age with any degree of preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the &s;ituation in which man is placed he is born to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uffer; and his di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;avage &s;tate, though fewer in number, are, like tho&s;e of the animals whom he nearly re&s;embles in his mode of life, more violent and more fatal. If lux|ury engenders and nouri&s;hes di&s;tempers of one &s;pecies, the rigour and di&s;tre&s;s of &s;av|age life brings on tho&s;e of another. As men in this &s;tate are wonderfully improvi|dent, and their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence pre|carious, they often pa&s;s from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according to the vici&s;|&s;itudes of fortune in the cha&s;e, or in con&s;e|quence of the various degree of abundance, with which the earth affords to them its pro|ductions in different &s;ea&s;ons Their in|con&s;iderate glu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tony in the one &s;ituation, and their &s;evere ab&s;tinence in the other, are equally pernicious. The &s;trength and vi|gour of &s;avages are at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, im|paired by what they &s;uffer from &s;carcity of food; at others, they are afflicted with di&s;|orders ari&s;ing from indige&s;tions and a &s;uper|fluity of gro&s;s aliment. The&s;e are &s;o com|mon, that they may be con&s;idered as the un|avoidable con&s;equence of their mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and cut off con&s;iderable num|bers in the prime of life. There are other di&s;orders, to which they are continually
<PB N="83" REF="025348_0096_0FCD00C9D4DA0EF8">expo&s;ed, owing to the inclemency of differ|ent &s;ea&s;ons. In the &s;avage &s;tate hard&s;hips and fatigues violently a&s;&s;ault the con&s;titu|tion, in poli&s;hed &s;ocieties, intemperance un|dermines it. It is not ea&s;y to determine which of them operates with mo&s;t fatal ef|fects, or tends mo&s;t to abridge human life.</P>
<P>The thoughts and attention of a &s;avage are confined within the &s;mall circle of ob|jects, immediately conducive to his pre&s;erv|ation or enjoyment. Every thing beyond that is beneath his ob&s;ervations, or is en|tirely indifferent to him. Like a mere ani|mal, what is before his eyes intere&s;ts and affects him; what is out of &s;ight or at a di&s;|tance. makes little impre&s;&s;ion. They fol|low blindly the impul&s;e of the appetite they feel, but are entirely regardle&s;s of di&s;tant con&s;equences, and even of tho&s;e remov|ed in the lea&s;t degree from immediate ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The active efforts of their minds are few and languid. The de&s;ires of &s;imple nature are very limited, and where a favour|able climate yields almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly what &s;uffices to gratify them, they &s;carcely &s;tir the &s;oul, or excite any violent emotion. Hence the people of &s;everal tribes in Amer|ica wa&s;te their lives in a &s;tate of indolence.</P>
<P>To be free from occupation, &s;eems to be all the enjoyment to which they a&s;pire. Such is their aver&s;ion to labour, that neith|er
<PB N="84" REF="025348_0097_0FCD00CB43584ED8">the hope of future good, nor the appre|hen&s;ion of evil, can &s;urmount it. They appear equally indifferent to both, di&s;cov|ering little &s;olicitude, and taking no pre|caution to avoid the one, or to &s;ecure the other. The cravings of hunger may rou&s;e them: but as they devour with little di&s;tinc|tion, whatever will appea&s;e its in&s;tinctive demands, the exertions the&s;e occa&s;ion are of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the rude&s;t tribes in America, a regular union between hu&s;band and wife was univer&s;al, and the rights of marriage were under&s;tood and recognized. In tho&s;e di&s;tricts where &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was &s;canty, and the difficulty of maintaining a family was great the man confined him&s;elf to one wife. In warmer and more fertile provinces, the facility of procuring food concurred with the influence of climate, in inducing the inhabitants to encrea&s;e the number of their wives. In &s;ome countries, the marriage union &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during life; in others, the impatience of the Americans under re&s;traint of any &s;pecies, together with their natural levity and caprice, prompted them to di&s;|&s;olve it on very &s;light pretexts, and often without a&s;&s;igning any cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the American women, in whatever light we con&s;ider them, was equally humiliating and mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erable. Among many people of America the marriage con|tract
<PB N="85" REF="025348_0098_0FCD00CDED28A758">is properly a purcha&s;e. The man buys his wife of her parents. Though unac|quainted with the u&s;e of money, or with &s;uch commerical tran&s;actions as take place in more improved &s;ociety, he knows how to give an equivalent for an object he de&s;ires to po&s;&s;e&s;s. In &s;ome places, the &s;uitor devotes his &s;ervice for a certain time to the parent of the maid whom he courts; in others, he hunts for them occa&s;ionally, or a&s;&s;i&s;ts in cultivating their fields, and forming their canoes; in others, he offers pre&s;ents of &s;uch things as are deemed mo&s;t valuable on account of their u&s;efulne&s;s or rarity. In return for the&s;e, he receives his wife; and this cir|cum&s;tance, added to the low e&s;timation of women among &s;avages, leads him to con|&s;ider her a female &s;ervant whom he has a ti|tle to treat as an inferior. The condition of an American woman is &s;o peculiarly grievous, and their depre&s;&s;ion &s;o complete, that &s;ervitude is a name too mild to de&s;cribe their wretched &s;tate. A wife, among mo&s;t tribes, is no better than a bea&s;t of burden, de&s;tined to every office of labour and fa|tigue. While the men loiter out the day in &s;loth, or &s;pend it in amu&s;ement, the wo|men are condemned to ince&s;&s;ant toil. Ta&s;ks are impo&s;ed upon them without pity, and &s;ervices are received without complacence or grat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de. Every circum&s;tance reminds
<PB N="86" REF="025348_0099_0FCD013A36000920">women of this mortifying inferiority. They mu&s;t approach their lords with reverence, regard them as more exalted beings, and are not permited to eat in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Americans are not deficient in affec|tion and attachment to their offspring. They feel the power of this in&s;tinct in its full force, and as long as their progeny continue feeble and helple&s;s no people exceed them in tenderne&s;s and care. In the &s;implicity of the &s;avage &s;tate the affections of parents, like the in&s;tinctive fondne&s;s of animals. cea&s;es almo&s;t entirely as &s;oon as their offspring at|tain maturity. Little in&s;truction fits them for that mode of life to which they are de&s;|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. The parents, as if their duty were accompli&s;hed, when they have conducted their children through the helple&s;s years of infancy, leave them afterwards at entire liberty. In an American but, a father, a mother, and their po&s;terity, live together like per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled by accident, without &s;eeming to feel the obligation of the duties mutually ari&s;ing from &s;uch connection.</P>
<P>Though the people of America may be all comprehendedr unde the general denom|ination of &s;avage, the advances they had made in the art of procuring to them&s;elves a certain and plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence were ve|ry unequal.

None but tribes contigious to great rivers can &s;upport them&s;elves in this man|ner. The greater part of the American nations, di&s;per&s;ed over the fore&s;ts with which their country is covered, do not pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with the &s;ame facility; but are obliged to obtain it by hunting, which in many parts is their principal occupation, and which requires &s;trenuous exertions.</P>
<P>As game and fi&s;h are the principal food of the Americans, their agriculture is neither exten&s;ive nor laborious. Their principal productions in this line are maze, mani|oc,
<PB N="88" REF="025348_0101_0FCCDBA18C012E60">plaintain, potatoes, and pimento. All the fruits of their indu&s;try, together with what their &s;oil and climate produced &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, afforded them but a &s;canty main|tenance. Though their demands for food were very &s;paring, they hardly rai&s;ed what was &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tor their own con&s;umption.</P>
<P>In America, the word nation is not of the &s;ame import as in other parts of the globe. It is applied to &s;mall &s;ocieties, per|haps not exceeding two or three hundred per&s;ons, but occupying provinces larger than &s;ome kingdoms in Europe. In the provinces which border on the Oronoco, one may travel &s;everal hundred miles, in different directions, without finding a &s;ingle hut or ob&s;erving the foot&s;teps of a human creature.</P>
<P>The Americans had no idea of property. As the animals on which the hunter feeds are not bred under his in&s;pection, nor nour|i&s;hed by his care, he can claim no right to them while they run wild in the fore&s;t. The fore&s;ts, or hunting grounds, are deemed the property of the tribe, from which it has a title to exclude every rival nation; but no individual arrogates a right to any di&s;trict of the&s;e, in preference to his fellow-citizen.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to take a cur&s;ory view of their art of war. Savage nations, in carrying on their public wars, are influ|enced by the &s;ame ideas, and animated with
<PB N="89" REF="025348_0102_0FCCDBA3B8FBEFB8">the &s;ame &s;pirit, as in pro&s;ecuting private vengeance. The maxims by which they regulate their military operations, though extremely different from tho&s;e, which take place among more civilized and populous nations, are well &s;uited to their own polit|ical &s;tate, and the nature of the country in which they act. They never take the field in numerous bodies, as it would require a greater effort of fore&s;ight and indu&s;try, than is u&s;ual among &s;avages, to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, during a march of &s;ome hun|dred miles through dreary fore&s;ts, or during a long voyage upon their lakes and rivers.</P>
<P>Their armies are not encumbered with baggage or military &s;tores. Each warrior, be&s;ides his arms, carries a mat and a &s;mall bag of pounded maize, and with the&s;e he is completely equipped for any &s;ervice. While at a di&s;tance from the enemies frontier, they di&s;per&s;e through the woods, and &s;up+port them&s;elves with the game they kill, and the fi&s;h they catch.

In the warmer and more mild climates of America, none of the rude tribes were cloathed. To mo&s;t of them Nature had not even &s;ugge&s;ted any Idea of impropriety of being altogether uncovered. As under a mild climate there was little need of any defence from the injuries of the air, and their extreme indolence &s;hunned every &s;pe|cies of labour to which it was not urged by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, all the inhabitants of the i&s;les, and a con&s;iderable part of the people on the continent, remained in this &s;tate of naked &s;implicity. Others were &s;atisfied with &s;ome &s;light covering, &s;uch as decency required; but though naked, they were not unadorned. They fa&s;tned bits of gold or &s;hells, or &s;hining &s;tones, to their ears, their no&s;es, and cheeks. They &s;tain|ed their &s;kins with a great variety of figures, and they &s;pent much time, and &s;ubmitted to great pain, in ornamenting their per&s;ons in this fanta&s;tic manner.</P>
<P>In one part of their dre&s;s, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight appears the mo&s;t &s;ingular and ca|pricious, the Americans have di&s;covered con&s;iderable &s;agacity in providing again&s;t the chief inconveniences of their climate, which is often &s;ultry, and moi&s;t to exce&s;s. All the different tribes, which remain un|clothed, are accu&s;tomed to anoint and rub their bodies with the grea&s;e of animals, with vi&s;cous gums, and with oils of differ|ent
<PB N="91" REF="025348_0104_0FCD00D1FA50A278">kinds. By this they check that profu&s;e per&s;piration, which in the torrid zone, wa&s;tes the vigour of the frame, and abridg|es the period of human life. By this too they provide a defence again&s;t the extreme moi&s;ture during the rainy &s;ea&s;on. They likewi&s;e, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, emper paint of different colours with tho&s;e unctious &s;ub|&s;tances, and bedaub them&s;elves plentifully with that compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Sheathed with this impenetrable varni&s;h their &s;kins are not only protected from the heat of the &s;un, but as all the innumerable tribes of infects have an antipathy to the &s;mell or ta&s;te of that mixture, they are de|livered from their teazing per&s;ecution, which amid&s;t fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes, e&s;pecially in the warmer regions, would have been wholly in&s;upportable in a &s;tate of perfect naked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Savage nations, being far from that &s;tate of improvement, in which the mode of liv|ing is con&s;idered as a mark of di&s;tinction, and unacquainted with tho&s;e wants, which re|quire a variety of accommodations, regulate the con&s;truction of their hou&s;es according to their limited ideas of nece&s;&s;ity. Some of the American tribes were &s;o extremely rude and had advanced &s;o little beyond the pri|meval &s;implicity of nature, that they had no hou&s;es at all. During the day, they took &s;helter from the &s;corching rays of the &s;un
<PB N="92" REF="025348_0105_0FCD00D3D56E4460">under thick trees, and at night they formed a &s;hed with their branches and leaves. In the rainy &s;ea&s;ons they retired into caves, formed by the hand of nature or hallowed out by their own indu&s;try. Others, who had no fixed abode, and roamed through the fore&s;t in que&s;t of game, &s;ojourned in temporary huts, which they erected with little labour, and abandoned without any concern.</P>
<P>Clubs made of heavy wood, &s;takes hard ened in the fire, lances who&s;e heads were armed with flint or the bone of &s;ome animal are weapons known to the rude&s;t nations. All the&s;e, however, were of u&s;e only in clo&s;e encounter; but men wi&s;hed to annoy their enemies while at a di&s;tance, and the bow and arrow is the mo&s;t early invention for this purpo&s;e. The people in &s;ome pro|vinces of Chili, and tho&s;e of Patagonia, to|wards the &s;outhern extremity of America, u&s;e a weapon peculiar to them&s;elves. They fa&s;ten &s;tones about the &s;ize of a man's fi&s;t to each end of a leather thong of eight feet in length, and &s;winging the&s;e round their heads, throw them with &s;uch dexterity that they &s;eldom mi&s;s the object they aim at.</P>
<P>As their food and habitations are perfect|ly &s;imple, their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils are few and rude. Some of the &s;outhern tribes di&s;|covered the art of forming ve&s;&s;els of earth|ern ware, and baking them in the &s;un &s;o as
<PB N="93" REF="025348_0106_0FCD00D50EB85F20">they could endure the fire. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els they u&s;ed in preparing part of their provi&s;i|ons, and this may be con&s;idered as a &s;tep toward refinement and luxury; for men in their rude&s;t &s;tate were not acquainted with any method of dre&s;&s;ing their victuals, but by roa&s;ting them on the fire, and among &s;everal tribes in America, this is the only &s;pecies of cookery yet known.</P>
<P>What appears to be the ma&s;ter-piece of art among the &s;avages of America is the con&s;truction of their canoes. An Indian, &s;hut up in his boat of whalebone, covered with &s;kins, can brave that &s;tormy ocean, on which he is compelled to depend for part of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The inhabitants of the i&s;les in South America form their ca|noes by hallowing the trunk of a large tree, with infinite labor, and though in appear|ance they are extremely awkward and un|wieldy, they paddle and &s;teer them with &s;uch dexterity, that Europeans, well ac|quainted with all the improvements in the &s;cience of navigation, have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the rapidity of their motion, and the quickne&s;s of their evolutions.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their religion, even a|mong tho&s;e tribes, who&s;e religious &s;y&s;tem was more enlarged, and who had formed &s;ome conception of benevolent beings, which delighted in conferring benefits, as well as of malicious powers prone to inflict
<PB N="94" REF="025348_0107_0FCD00D6AAF28D78">evil, &s;uper&s;tition &s;till appears as the off|&s;pring of fear, and all its efforts were em|ployed to avert calamities. They were per|&s;uaded that their good deities, prompted by the benificence of their nature, would be|&s;tow every ble&s;&s;ing in their power, without &s;olicitation or acknowledgement; and their only anxiety was to &s;ooth and deprecate the wrath of the powers, whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the immortality of the &s;oul the &s;entiments of the Americans were more united. The human mind, even when lea&s;t improved and invigorated by culture, &s;hrinks from the thoughts of di&s;&s;olution, and looks forward with hope and expectation to a &s;tate of future exi&s;tence. The mo&s;t uncivilized &s;avages of America do not apprehend death as the extinction of being: all entertain hopes of a future and more happy &s;tate, where they &s;hall be for ever exempt from the calamities, which em|bitter human life in its pre&s;ent condition. This future &s;tate they conceive to be a de|lightful country ble&s;t with perpetual &s;pring, who&s;e fore&s;ts abound with game, who&s;e riv|ers &s;warm with fi&s;h, where famine is never felt, and uninterrupted plenty &s;hall be en|joyed without labor or toil.</P>
<P>As the di&s;ea&s;es of men in the &s;avage &s;tate are like tho&s;e of the animal creation, few but extremely violent, their impatience un|der

However the&s;e ignorant pretenders being &s;uch utter &s;tran|ger to the &s;tructure of the human frame, as to know neither the cau&s;es of di&s;or|ders, nor the manner in which they were likely to terminate, &s;uper&s;tition, frequent|ly mingled with &s;ome portion of craft, &s;upplied what they wanted in knowledge. They imputed the origin of di&s;ea&s;es to &s;upernatural influence, and advi&s;ed or performed a variety of &s;uper&s;titious rites, which they repre&s;ented to be &s;ufficient to remove the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and dangerous di&s;orders.</P>
<P>From the &s;uper&s;tition and credulity of the Americans likewi&s;e proceeded their faith in dreams, their ob&s;ervation of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mens, their attention to the chirping of birds, and the cries of animals, all which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be indications of future events; and if any one of their progno&s;|tics was deemed unfavorable, they eagerly abandoned the object they had in pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Savage as the Americans were, they were not without their amu&s;ements; and of the&s;e dancing appears to be the princi|pal

Their &s;ongs and dances are mo&s;tly &s;olemn, and martial, they are connected with &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;erious and important affairs of life, and, having no relation to love or gallantry, are &s;eldom common to the two &s;exes, but executed by the men and women apart.</P>
<P>The Americans are univer&s;ally fond of gaming. Though they are at other times &s;o indifferent, phlegmatic, &s;ilent, and animated with &s;o few de&s;ires, as &s;oon as they engage in play, they become rapa|cious, impatient, noi&s;y, and almo&s;t frantic with eagerne&s;s. Their furs, their do|me&s;tic uten&s;ils, their clothes, their arms, are &s;taked at play and when all is lo&s;t, high as their &s;en&s;e of independence is, in a wild emotion of hope or de&s;pair, they will often ri&s;k their per&s;onal liberty upon a &s;ingle bet. Among &s;everal tribes, &s;uch gaming parties are frequently made, and become their mo&s;t agreeable entertain|ment at every great fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;es that contribute to render them fond of play, is the cau&s;e of drunkenne&s;s among them. It &s;eems to have been one of the fir&s;t exertions of the human ingenuity to di&s;cover &s;ome <GAP DESC="missing">

The mo&s;t barbarous of the American tribes have been &s;o unfortunate as to attain this art; and even tho&s;e which are deficient in knowledge as not to be acquainted with the method of giving an inebriating &s;trength to liquors by fermentation, can accompli&s;h the &s;ame by &s;ome other means.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary with the American Indians, when their parents and other relations become old, or labour under any di&s;temper which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have not art enough to cure, to put an end to their lives, in order to be relieved from the burden of tending and &s;upporting them. The &s;ame hard&s;hips and difficulty of procuring &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, which prevent &s;avages, in &s;ome ca&s;es, from rearing their children, prompt them to de&s;troy the aged and infirm. The declining &s;tate of the one is as help|le&s;s as the infancy of the other; and the American thinks he does nothing more than his duty, in ea&s;ing his father or friend of a burthen&s;ome life of pain and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A hardne&s;s of heart and in&s;en&s;ibility of feeling are remarkable in all &s;avage nations. Their minds, rou&s;ed only by &s;trong emotions, are little &s;u&s;ceptible of
<PB N="98" REF="025348_0111_0FCD00DE0E75C840">gentle, delicate, or tender affections. When any favor is done him, he neither feels gratitude, nor thinks of making any return. The high idea of independence among the Americans nouri&s;hes a &s;ullen re&s;erve, which keeps them at a di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P>A &s;avage, frequently placed in &s;ituations of danger or di&s;tre&s;s, depending on no one but him&s;elf, and wrapped up in his own thoughts and &s;chemes, is a &s;erious and melancholy animal. The American, when not engaged in action, often &s;its whole days in one po&s;ture, without opening his lips. When they engage in war or the chace, they u&s;ually march in a line at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, and do not ex|change a &s;ingle word. Even in their ca|noes, the &s;ame profound &s;ilence is ob&s;erv|ed; and nothing but intoxicating liquors or jolity attending their dances, can at any rate render them in the lea&s;t conver&s;|able.</P>
<P>We may attribute the refined cunning, with which they form and execute their &s;chemes, to the &s;ame cau&s;es. With the American Indians, war is a &s;y&s;tem of craft, in which they tru&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s to &s;tratagem more than to open force, and have their invention continually at work to cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um|vent and &s;urpri&s;e their enemies. The
<PB N="99" REF="025348_0112_0FCD00DF8BAB4E00">people of the rude tribes of America are remarkable for their artifice and duplicity. The na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ives of Peru were employed above thirty years, in forming the plan of an in&s;urrection, which took place under the vice-royalty of the Marquis de Villa Gar|cia; and though a great number of people of different ranks, were let into the &s;ecret, yet not a &s;yllable of it tran&s;pired during all that period, no man betrayed his tru&s;t, or by an unguarded look, or imprudent word, gave ri&s;e to any &s;u&s;picion of what was meditating.</P>
<P>However, let us not &s;uppo&s;e that the Americans were without their virtues, among which fortitude and courage were remarkably con&s;picious. Accu&s;tomed as the Indians are to continual alarms, they grow familiar with danger; courage be|comes an habitual virtue, re&s;ulting na|turally from their &s;ituation, and &s;trength|ened by con&s;tant exertions. They are naturally attached to the community of which they are members. From the nature of their political union, we &s;hould be led to &s;uppo&s;e this tie to be very feeble; but each individual freely and cheerfully undertakes the mo&s;t perilous &s;ervice, when the community deems it nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>AMBITION and avarice united to in|duce Vela&s;quez to prepare for the con|que&s;t of New Spain, &s;o that when Grijalva returned to Cuba, he &s;ound the armament de&s;tined to attempt the conque&s;t of that rich country he had di&s;covered, almo&s;t complete and ready to &s;ail. Vela&s;quez knew not whom to entru&s;t with the com|mand of this important expedition. Tho' he was of a mo&s;t a&s;piring ambition, and not de&s;titute of talents for government, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither &s;uch courage, nor &s;uch vigour and activity of mind, as to under|take in per&s;on the conduct of the arma|ment he was preparing. He meanly wi&s;h|ed to find &s;ome per&s;on, who had bravery and abilities equal to the undertaking, but would at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ribute all the honour and glory to him. After &s;ome time &s;earching for &s;uch a per&s;on, and finding that no man of abilities would &s;ubmit to &s;uch di&s;grace|ful terms, he at la&s;t appo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted Fernando Cortes to the command. Cortes was a man of noble blood, but who&s;e family was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">moderate fortune: he was a good &s;ol|dier,
<PB N="102" REF="025348_0115_0FCD00E506C4E900">and every way qualified for &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P>Though the governor had laid out con&s;iderable &s;ums, and each adventurer had exhau&s;ted his &s;tock, or &s;trained his credit, the poverty of the preparation was &s;uch, as mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h the pre&s;ent age, and bore no re&s;emblance to an armament de&s;tined for the conque&s;t of a great empire. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of eleven ve&s;&s;els, the large&s;t of one hundred tons, which was dignified with the name of Admiral; three of &s;eventy or eighty tons and the re&s;t &s;mall open barks. On board of the&s;e were 617 men; of which 508 belonged to the land &s;ervice, and 109 were &s;eamen or artificers. As the u&s;e of fire-arms among the nations of Europe was hitherto con|fined to a few battallions of regular di&s;ci|plined infantry, only thirteen &s;oldiers were armed with mu&s;kets; thirty-two were cro&s;s-bow men, and the re&s;t had &s;words and &s;pears. They had only &s;ixteen hor&s;es and ten &s;mall field-pieces.</P>
<P>On the 10th of February, 1519, Cor|tes &s;ailed with his &s;mall armament to at|tack a mo&s;t powerful monarch. He touch|ed fir&s;t at Cozumal, then at Taba&s;co, and on the 2d of April arrived at St. Juan de U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ua in Mexico. As &s;oon as they entered the harbour, a boat came off to them, to
<PB N="103" REF="025348_0116_0FCD00E6EE3890B8">know what was the intention of their vi&s;it, and to offer them their a&s;&s;i&s;tance if needful. Cortes a&s;&s;ured them, in re&s;pectful terms, which he did by means of an in|terpreter, that he approached their coun|try with mo&s;t friendly &s;entiments, and came to propo&s;e matters of great impor|tance to the welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he would unfold more fully, in per&s;on, to the governor and the general. Next morning, without waiting for any an&s;wer, he landed his troops, his hor&s;es, and artillery; and having cho&s;en proper ground, began to erect huts for his men, and fortify his camp.</P>
<P>The Mexicans treated the Spaniards with the greate&s;t civility, but wi&s;hed to divert them from their intention of vi&s;it|ing the capital, where the emperor Mon|tezuma re&s;ided. For this purpo&s;e, they commenced a negociation, by introducing a train of a hundred Indians loaded with pre&s;ents, &s;ent from Montezuma to Cortes. The magnificence of the&s;e were &s;uch as became a great monarch, and far exceeded any idea the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth. They were placed upon mats &s;pread on the ground, in &s;uch order as &s;hewed them to the greate&s;t ad|vantage. Cortes and his officers viewed
<PB N="104" REF="025348_0117_0FCD00E7C260D748">with admiration the various manufactures of the country; cotton &s;tuffs &s;o fine, and of &s;uch delicate texture, as to re&s;emble &s;ilks; pictures of animals, trees and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, di&s;po&s;ed and mingled with &s;uch &s;kill and elegance, as to rival the works of the pencil in truth and beau|ty of imitation, but what more particu|larly attracted the attention of the Span|iards, was the amazing quantity of un|wrought gold and &s;ilver, and the profu&s;ion of pearls and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious &s;tones, the produce of the country.</P>
<P>The&s;e rich pre&s;ents, in&s;tead of inducing the Spaniards to quit Mexico, made them the more re&s;olute to make a conque&s;t of it.

<P>Montezuma from the moment the Spaniards appeared on the coa&s;t, di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of timidity and embarra&s;&s;ment, In&s;tead of taking &s;uch re&s;olutions as his power enabled him, he deliberated with an anxiety and he&s;&s;itation that did not e&s;cape the notice of the meane&s;t of his courtiers. He &s;pent his time in fruitle&s;s negociations with the Spaniards, and thereby rai&s;ed their courage and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cortes was watching the opportunity to throw off all connec|tions with Vela&s;quez, who&s;e natural jeal|ou&s;y had induced him to endeavour to deprive Cortes of the command of the expedition before he &s;ailed. He got the confidence of the officers and &s;oldiers, and, having a&s;&s;embled a council, he re|&s;igned the commi&s;&s;ion he had received from Vela&s;quez, and was immediately cho&s;en chief-ju&s;tice and captain-general of the new colony.</P>
<P>Cortes owed much of his &s;ucce&s;s to the Mexican gold, which he di&s;tributed with a liberal hand among both friends and opponents, and thereby brought all to be of one mind. Having thus &s;ettled every thing to the &s;atisfaction of his army, by engaging it to join him in di&s;claiming any
<PB N="106" REF="025348_0120_0FCD00EF4D406138">dependance on the governor of Cuba, he thought he might now venture to quit the camp, in which he had hitherto remained, and advance into the country. To this he was en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouraged by an event no le&s;s fortunate than &s;ea&s;onable. He received a proffer of friend&s;hip from the Cazique of Zimpoalla, a con&s;iderable town at no great di&s;tance. He found by their me&s;&s;age, that they were filled with &s;uch dread and hatred of Montezuma, that nothing could be more acceptable to them, than a pro&s;|pect of deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ions under which they groaned. Cortes was highly delighted to find, that the great empire he intended to attack was not united, nor its &s;overeign beloved.</P>
<P>Some officers, whom Cortes had em|ployed to &s;urvey the coa&s;t, having di&s;co|vered a village about forty miles to the northward, which, as well on account of the fertility of the &s;oil, as commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iou&s;|ne&s;s of the harbour, &s;eemed to be a more proper &s;tation for a &s;ettlement than that where he was encamped, he determined to remove thither; Zimpoalla lay in his way, where the cazique welcomed him in the manner he had rea&s;on to expect. He received Cortes with re&s;pect, almo&s;t ap|proaching to adoration, and like one to whom he looked up as a deliverer. From
<PB N="107" REF="025348_0121_0FCD00F144F0E868">the cazique he learned many particulars with re&s;pect to the character of Montezu|ma, whom he repre&s;ented as a tyrant, haughty, cruel and &s;u&s;picious. Cortes a&s;&s;ured the cazique, that one great object of the &s;paniards in vi&s;iting a country &s;o remote from their own, was to redre&s;s grievances, and to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having taken his leave of the cazique, he continued his march to Quiabi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an. The &s;pot his officers had cho&s;en as a pro|per &s;ituation, appeared &s;o well to meet his approbation, that he immediately marked out ground for a town. The hou&s;es to be erected were only huts; but the&s;e were to be &s;urrounded with fortifications, of &s;ufficient &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of an indian army. Every one, even Cortes not excepted, gave an helping hand to the erecting of fortifications, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of every individual of the colony. His next care was to form an alliance with the neighbouring kings, whom he taught to de&s;pi&s;e their emperor, by gradually in&s;piring them with an high opinion of the Spaniards, as beings of a &s;uperior order, and irre&s;i&s;tible in arms.</P>
<P>Cortes perceiving that &s;ome of his men grew tired of their pre&s;ent pur&s;uits, and had even formed the plan of making their e&s;cape to Cuba in one of the &s;hips, &s;aw

Thus from an effort of magnanim|ity, to which there is nothing parallel in hi&s;|tory, five hundred men voluntarily con&s;ent|ed to be &s;hut up in a ho&s;tile country&punc; filled with powerful and unknown nations; and having precluded every means of e&s;cape left them&s;elves without any re&s;ource but what their own per&s;everance and valour could procure them, and on which every thing now depended.</P>
<P>On the 16th of Augu&s;t, 1519, Cortes began his march from Zimpoalla, with 500 men, fifteen hor&s;e and &s;ix field pieces The remainder of his troops, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;uch as from age or infirmity were le&s;s fit for active &s;ervice, he left as a garri&s;on in Villa Rica, under the command of E&s;ca|lante, an officer of merit, and warmly at|tached to the intere&s;t of Cortes.</P>

The fir&s;t war he engaged in was with the Ha&s;calens, who advanced again&s;t him with numerous armies, and attacked him in various forms, with a degree of valour and per&s;everance to which the Spaniards had &s;een nothing equal in the new world.

If you are mild deities, accept an offer of incen&s;e and va|riegated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, and bread and fruit to nouri&s;h you." As both parties were equally de|&s;irous of peace, matters were &s;oon &s;ettled between them. The Ha&s;calens acknow|ledged them&s;elves as dependent on the crown of Ca&s;tile; when Cortes took the republic under his protection, and prom|i&s;ed to &s;ecure them again&s;t every attempt of injury on their per&s;ons or property.</P>
<P>On the 13th of October, Cortes &s;et out on his march for Mexico, accompanied by &s;ix thou&s;and Ha&s;calens, &s;o that he now appeared at the head of &s;omething like a regular army. As the Spaniards de|&s;cended from the mountains of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">.
<PB N="110" REF="025348_0124_0FCD00F55829F578">over which the road lay, the va&s;t plains of Mexico gradually unfolded it&s;elf to their view. This pro&s;pect afforded one of the mo&s;t &s;triking and beautiful views on the face of the earth; when they beheld fer|tile and cultived fields, &s;tretching beyond the reach of the human eye; when they &s;aw a lake re&s;embling the &s;ea in extent, encompa&s;&s;ed with large towns, and beheld the capital city ri&s;ing upon an i&s;land in the centre, adorned with its temples and turrets; the pro&s;pect &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, that &s;ome believed the fancified de&s;criptions of ro|mance were realized, and that its enchant|ed palaces and gilded domes were pre|&s;ented to their &s;ight; others could hard|ly per&s;uade them&s;elves, that this wonder|ful &s;ight was any thing more than a dream. As they proceeded their doubts were re|moved, but their amazement encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Cortes was almo&s;t at the gates of the capital before Montezuma had determined, whether he &s;hould receive him as a friend, or oppo&s;e him as an enemy. On their arrival near the city, about a thou&s;and per&s;ons, who bore marks of di&s;tinction, can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to meet them, dre&s;&s;ed in man|tles of fine cotton and ardorned with plumes. Each of the&s;e &s;eperately pa&s;&s;ed Cortes&punc; and paid the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obe|dience
<PB N="111" REF="025348_0125_0FCD00F6CA7F87D0">to him according to the mode of their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma him&s;elf, and his harbingers &s;oon after came in &s;ight. Two hundred per&s;ons in an uniform dre&s;s fir&s;t appeared, ornamented with feathers, proceeding two and two, barefooted, and in profound &s;ilence, with their eyes fixed on the ground. A company of higher rank next followed, in their mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous ornaments; in the mid&s;t of whom was Montezuma, in a litter richly orna|mented with gold, and feathers of various colours. He was carried on the &s;houlders of four of his principal favorites, while others &s;upported a canopy of curious workman&s;hip over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals, when all the people immediately bowed their heads and hid their faces, as unworthy to look on &s;o great a monarch. As &s;oon as he approached Cortes di&s;mounted, advanced towards him with officious ha&s;te, and in a re&s;pectful po&s;ture. Montezuma immed|iately alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near rela|tions, approached with a &s;low and &s;tately &s;tep, his attendants covering the &s;treets with cotton cloth, that he might not
<PB N="112" REF="025348_0126_0FCD00F83B890720">touch the ground. Cortes acco&s;ted him with profound reverence, after the Eu|ropean fa&s;hion; and Montezuma return|ed the &s;alutation according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then ki&s;&s;ing it. Mon|tezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters he had prepared for his reception, and immediately took leave of him with a politene&s;s not unworthy of a court more refined. Nothing material pa&s;&s;ed at this fir&s;t interview.</P>
<P>In the evening, Montezuma returned to vi&s;it his gue&s;ts with the &s;ame pomp as in their fir&s;t interview. He told Cortes, that from what he had heard and &s;een of him and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very per&s;ons, who&s;e ap|pearance the Mexican traditions and pro|phecies taught them to expect, in order to reform their con&s;titutions and laws; that he had accordingly received them not as &s;trangers, but as relations of the &s;ame blood and parentage, and de&s;ired that they might con&s;ider them&s;elves as ma&s;ters in his dominions, for both him&s;elf and his &s;ubjects &s;hould be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wi&s;h|es. The three &s;ub&s;equent days were em|ployed in viewing the city; the appear|ance of which, &s;o far &s;uperior in the ord|er
<PB N="113" REF="025348_0127_0FCD00FBB56B6658">of its buildings, and the number of its inhabitants, to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, filled them with wonder and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Though the novelty of the&s;e objects amu&s;ed the Spaniards, yet they were not without their alarms on account of their &s;afety. The allies of the Spaniards a&s;&s;ur|ed Cortes, that the Mexican prie&s;ts had, in the name of the gods, coun&s;elled their &s;overeign to admit the Spaniards into the capital, that he might cut them off there at one blow with perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Cortes very plainly perceived that his de&s;truction was intended; it was there|fore nece&s;&s;ary to extricate him&s;elf out of the difficulties, in which one bold &s;tep had involved him, by venturing upon another &s;till bolder. The &s;ituation was trying but his mind was equal to it; and; after re|volving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan no le&s;s extraordinary th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n daring. He de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ermined to &s;eize Montezuma in his palace and carry him as a pri&s;oner to the Spani&s;h quarters. The plan being properly &s;ettled between Cortes and his officers, this powerful monarch was &s;eized by a few &s;trangers in the mid&s;t of his capital, at noon day, and carried off as a pri&s;oner, without oppo&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tion or blood&s;hed. Hi&s;tory contains no+thing

<P>On the 4th of December, 1519, Qual|copoca, the &s;on of Montezuma, and five of the principal officers who &s;erved under him, were brought pri&s;oners to the citidel, formally tried by a Spani&s;h courtmartial, and, though they had acted no other part than what became loyal &s;ubjects and brave men, they were con|demned to be burnt alive, which was im|mediately put in execution. The rigour with which Cortes puni&s;hed the unhappy per&s;ons, who fir&s;t pre&s;umed to lay violent hands upon his followers, &s;eems to have made all the impre&s;&s;ions he de&s;ired. The &s;pirit of Montezuma was not only over|awed, but &s;ubdued. During &s;ix months that Cortes remained in Mexico, the monarch continued in the Spani&s;h quar|ters, with the appearance of an entire &s;atisfaction, and tranquility, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had re&s;ided there, not from con&s;traint, but through choice. His mini&s;ters and officers
<PB N="115" REF="025348_0129_0FCD00FE40340468">attended him as u&s;ual, he took cognizance of all affairs, and every order was i&s;&s;ued in his name. The external a&s;pect of government appearing the &s;ame, and all its ancient forms being &s;crupulou&s;ly ob|&s;erved, the people were &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of any change, that they obeyed the mandates of their monarch with the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive reverence as ever. Thus, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in &s;eizing Montezuma, the Spaniards at once &s;ecured to them&s;elves more exten&s;ive au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hority in the Mexican empire, than it was po&s;&s;ible to have acquired in a long cour&s;e of time by open force; and they exerci&s;ed more ab&s;olute &s;way in the name of another, than they could have done in their own.</P>
<P>Cortes, encouraged by &s;o many in&s;tan|ces of the monarch's tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will ventured to put it to a proof &s;till more trying. He urged Montezuma to ac|knowledge him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al of the king of Ca&s;tile, to hold his crown of him as &s;uper|ior, and to &s;ubject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requi&s;ition, the la&s;t and mo&s;t humbling that can be made to one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ove|reign authority, Montezuma was &s;o ob&s;e|quious as to comply. The act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and homage was executed with all the for|malities the Spaniards were plea&s;ed to dic|tate.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="025348_0130_0FCD010044932C50">
The next attempt Cortes made was to alter their religion, which had &s;uch an ef|fect upon the Mexicans, that they deter|mined to de&s;troy the Spaniards if they per&s;i&s;ted in it; and even Montezuma him&s;elf had expre&s;&s;ed his with to Cortes, that he would think of returning home.</P>
<P>While things continued in this critical &s;ituation, Cortes, anxious about what was pa&s;t, uncertain with re&s;pect to the future, and much oppre&s;&s;ed by the late declaration of the Mexicans, he received an account of &s;ome &s;hips having appeared on the coa&s;t. He idly imagined that his me&s;&s;en|gers were returned from Spain, and that the completion of all his hopes and wi&s;hes were at hand. However a cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ier &s;oon brought certain information, that the ar|mament was fitted out by Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;quez, gov|ernor of Cuba, and in&s;tead of bringing the aid they expected, threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ened them with immediate de&s;truction. This arma|ment was commanded by Pamphilo de Narvaez</P>
<P>Cortes was now greatly alarmed, as Nar|vaez &s;eemed determined to ruin him, hav|ing received orders from Vela&s;quez to &s;eize him and &s;end him to Cuba in irons. Cortes at fir&s;t attempted to treat with his enemies; but finding that impo&s;&s;ible, he marched ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them with an army in|finitely
<PB N="117" REF="025348_0131_0FCD0101A1C32C58">inferior to their's, and ru&s;hing upon them, in the night, obtained a complete victory. Narvaez was wounded, taken pri&s;oner, and put in irons.</P>
<P>This victory proved the more accepta|ble, as it was gained with little blood&s;hed, only two &s;oldiers being killed on the &s;ide of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men, of the adver&s;e faction. Cor|tes treated the vanqui&s;hed not like ene|mies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered to &s;end them back immedi|ately to Cuba, or to take them into his &s;ervice, as partners in his fortune, on e|qual terms with his own &s;oldiers. The greater part of them accepted the offer, and vied with each other in profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity and attachment to a general, who&s;e recent &s;ucce&s;&s;es had given them &s;uch a &s;triking proof of his abilities. Thus, by a &s;eries of events no le&s;s fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only e&s;caped from the de&s;truction that &s;eemed inevitable, but, when he had lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it, was placed at the head of a thou&s;and re|&s;olute Spaniards.</P>
<P>While Cortes was engaged in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the Mexicans &s;eized the opportuni|ty of his ab&s;ence to take up arms, to which they had been more particularly urged by the cruelty and treachery of Alvarado,
<PB N="118" REF="025348_0132_0FCD0102CC1287C8">whom Cortes had left in the city, in or|der to take care of the royal pri&s;oner and keep the natives in awe.</P>
<P>On the 24th of June, 1520, Cortes marched back to the city and took quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ancient &s;tation. Howev|er, being too much elated with his &s;uc|ce&s;s, he neglected to vi&s;it Montezuma, and embittered the in&s;ult by expre&s;&s;ions full of contempt for that unfortunate prince and his people. This being rumour|ed about, they flew to arms in every quar|ter, and attacked the Spaniards in their fortifications. Though the artillery point|ed at their numerous battallions, crowded together in narrow &s;treets, &s;wept off mul|titudes at every di&s;charge, though every blow of the Spani&s;h weapons fell with mortal effects upon their naked bodies, the violence of the a&s;&s;ault by no means abated. Fre&s;h men ru&s;hed forward to occupy the places of the &s;lain, and meet|ing with the &s;ame fate, were &s;ucceeded by others no le&s;s intrepid and eager for vengence. The utmo&s;t efforts and abilities of Cortes, &s;econded by the di&s;ciplined valour of his troops, were hardly &s;ufficient to defend the fortifications of the Spaniards, into which the Mexicans had nearly for|ced their way.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="025348_0133_0FCD01044A87C918">
Cortes was now willing to try what effect the &s;ight of ahe emperor would have upon his &s;ubjects. He was record|ingly brought on the ramparts, from whence he addre&s;&s;ed the Mexicans, ex|horting them to peaceable mea&s;ures, which &s;o enraged them, that he was &s;oon wound|ed by two arrows, and the blow of a &s;tone on his temples brought him to the ground. The Spaniards carried him to his apartments; but he was &s;o broken and dejected by the &s;everity of his fate, that he tore off the bandage from his wounds, and &s;oon expired.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Montezuma, Cortes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to abandon the city. He attempted his retreat by night, but the Mexicans, who had watched all his motions, fell upon him in his march and de&s;troyed nearly one half of his army. All the artillery, ammutition, and baggage, were lo&s;t, and only a very &s;mall portion of the trea&s;ure they had ama&s;&s;ed was &s;aved. Many of the &s;oldiers, having &s;o overloaded them|&s;elves with bars of gold as rendered them unfit for action, and retarded their flight, fell ignominiou&s;ly the victims of their own incon&s;iderate avarice.</P>
<P>Cortes directed his march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owards a ri&s;ing ground at &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le di&s;tance, and

On the &s;ixth day of their march, they reached the &s;ummit of an eminence, when a &s;pacious valley opened to their view, cov|ered with a va&s;t army, extending as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harra&s;&s;|ed the Spaniards in their retreat, had a&s;|&s;embled their principal force on the other &s;ide of the lake, and po&s;ted it in the plain of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes mu&s;t pa&s;s. At the &s;ight of this in|credible multitude, which they could &s;ur|vey at once from the ri&s;ing ground, the Spaniards were a&s;toni&s;hed, and even the bolde&s;t began to de&s;pair.

<P><PB N="122" REF="025348_0136_0FCD0109868A7810">
Cortes now ob&s;erved, that the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;tandard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican gen&punc; was advancing. He fortunately recollected to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle. He therefore a&s;&s;embled a few of his brave&s;t officers, who&s;e hor&s;es were &s;till capable of &s;ervice, and placing him&s;elf at their head, pu&s;hed forwards towards the &s;tandard, with an impetuo&s;ity that bore down every thing before it. A cho&s;en body of nobles, who guarded the &s;tandard, made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance&punc; but were &s;oon vanqui&s;hed. Cortes, with a &s;troke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of the Spani&s;h officers alighting, fini&s;hed his life, and &s;eized the imperial &s;tandard. The in|&s;tant their leader fell, and their &s;tandard, to which all directed their eyes, was no lon|ger to be &s;een, an univer&s;al panic &s;truck the Mexican<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, every en&s;ign was lowered, each &s;oldier threw away his weapons, and every one made the be&s;t of his way to the mountains. The Spaniards, who were not in a condition to pur&s;ue them, contented them&s;elves with collecting the &s;poils of the field, which were &s;o valuable, as to be &s;ome compen&s;ation for the wealth they had lo&s;t in the city of Mexico.</P>
<P>After this victory, Cortes di&s;patched an officer of confidence with four &s;hips of
<PB N="123" REF="025348_0137_0FCD010AFA9C9F98">Narvaez's to Hi&s;paniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purcha&s;e hor&s;es, gunpowder, and other military &s;tores.

<P>While he was harra&s;&s;ed and perplexed with the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of his troops, two &s;hips arrived, with a &s;upply of men and military &s;tores, &s;ent by the governor of Cu|ba, not to a&s;&s;i&s;t Cortes, but with a view to complete his ruin. His addre&s;s, however, brought them over to his views. He now found his army reinforced with 180 Span|iards, and twenty hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Soon after this four &s;hips arrived at Vera Cruz from Hi&s;paniola, with two hundred &s;oldiers, eighty hor&s;es, and two battering cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and a con&s;iderable &s;upply of am|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ion and arms.</P>
<P>On the 28th of April, 1521, all the Span|i&s;h troops, together with the auxiliary In|dians were drawn up on the banks of the Ganal; and with extraordinary military pomp, heightened and rendered more &s;o|lemn by the celebration of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of religion, the brigantines were

<P>Cortes now determined to attack the city, and for this purpo&s;e he made all the wi&s;e preparations an able general could do; but, owing to his orders not being properly ob|&s;erved, he was at la&s;t repul&s;ed, received &s;ome dangerous wounds and would have been taken by the Mexicans, had not &s;ome Spani&s;h officers re&s;cued him at the expen&s;e of their lives.

<P>However unpromi&s;ing an a&s;pect matters wore at pre&s;ent, Cortes had a mind that ro&s;e above all difficulties.

<P>As &s;oon as the fate of this unfortunate &s;overeign was known, the Mexicans cea&s;ed all re&s;i&s;tance, and Cortes took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;mall part of the capital, which had not been de&s;troyed during the &s;iege.

The Spaniards were no &s;ooner ma&s;ters of the city, than they &s;et about &s;eeking for the profu&s;e riches they expected it would produce; but they were herein &s;adly di&s;ap|pointed.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;covery of the Southern Ocean by Balboa excited a &s;pirit of adventure in the colonies of Darien and Panama, who &s;ighed after the imaginary wealth of tho&s;e unknown regions. Several armaments were fitted out in 1523, in order to explore and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the countries to the Ea&s;t of Panama, but under the conduct of leaders, who&s;e talents and re&s;ources were unequal to the attempt. The proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and thereby damped the ardor of others.</P>
<P>Three per&s;ons &s;ettled in Panama, who&s;e names were Franci&s;co Pizarro. Diego de Almagro and Hernando Luque, re&s;olved to attempt the di&s;covery of Peru, notwith|&s;tanding the ill &s;ucce&s;s of former adventur|ers. The&s;e three men were de&s;tined to o|verturn one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive empires on the face of the earth; though Pizarro was a ba&s;tard, with very little education; Almagro a foundling; and Luque, a prie&s;t and &s;choolma&s;ter at Panama.</P>
<P>Each engaged to employ his whole for|tune in this adventure. Pizarro, being the poore&s;t of the three, undertook the de|partment of the greate&s;t fatigue and danger,
<PB N="133" REF="025348_0147_0FCD011C9B641D90">and to command in per&s;on the armament de&s;tined for the di&s;covery. Almagro was to conduct the &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and reinforcement of troops, of which Pizarro might &s;tand in need. Luque was to remain at Panama to negociate with the governor, and &s;uperintend whatever was carrying on for the general good. As the &s;pirit of en|thu&s;ia&s;m uniformly accompanied that of adventure in the New World, and by that &s;trange union both acquired an increa&s;e of force, this confederacy formed by ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the mo&s;t &s;olemn act of religion. Luque celebrated ma&s;s, divided a con&s;ecrated ho&s;t into three, and re&s;erving one part to him&s;elf, gave the other two to his a&s;&s;ociates, of which they par|took, and thus, in the name of the Prince of Peace, ratified a contract, of which plunder and blood&s;ned were the principal objects in view.</P>
<P>On the 14th of November, 1525, Pi|zarro &s;et &s;ail from Panama with a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el of &s;mall burthen, and 112 men. His vovage, however, was attended with great difficulties and hard&s;hips. After re|maining five months in the i&s;land of Gor|gona, noted for the mo&s;t unhealthy climate in that region of America. A ve&s;&s;el arri|ved from Panama. This tran&s;ported them with &s;uch joy, that all their former &s;uffer|ings were forgotten. Their hopes revived,
<PB N="134" REF="025348_0148_0FCD011DC0345288">and Pizarro &s;ound little ciffienlty to indu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not only his own followers, but al&s;o the crew of the ve&s;&s;el from Panama, to re&s;ume his former &s;cheme with no left ardor. In|&s;tead of returning to Panama, they &s;tood towards the South Ea&s;t, and more for|tunate in this than in any of their pa&s;t ef|forts, on the twentieth day after their depar|ture from Gorgona, they di&s;covered the coa&s;t of Peru.</P>
<P>After touching at &s;everal village on the coa&s;t, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anded at Tumbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a place of &s;ome note, about three degrees &s;outh of the line, di&s;tingui&s;hed for its &s;tately temple, and a palace of the Incas, or &s;overeigus of the country. There the Spaniards fea&s;ted their eves with the fir&s;t view of the opu|lence and civilization of the Peruvian em|pire. They beheld a country fully peopled and cultivated with an appearance of regular indu&s;try; the natives decently cloathed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ingenuity &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the other inhabitants of the New World, as to have the u&s;e of tame and dome&s;tie aninals. But what chiefly attracted their notice, was &s;uch a &s;how of gold and &s;ilver not only in the ornaments of their per&s;ons and temples, but in &s;everal ve&s;&s;els and uten&s;ils for common u&s;e, formed of tho&s;e precious metals as left no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oom to doubt that it abounded with profu&s;ion in the coun|try. Pizarro and his companions, now
<PB N="135" REF="025348_0149_0FCD011F95816EA0">&s;eemed to have attained the completion of their mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, and fancied that all their wi&s;hes and dreams of rich domains, and inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures, would &s;oon be realized.</P>
<P>Pizarro, having explored the country as far as it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the im|portance of the di&s;covery, procured from the inhabitants &s;ome of their <HI>Llamas,</HI> or &s;ame cattle, to which the Spaniards gave the name of &s;heep; &s;ome ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver, as well as &s;ome &s;pecimens of their other works of ingenuity; and two young men, whom he propo&s;ed to in&s;truct in the Co&s;tilian language, that they might &s;erve as interpeters in the expedition he meditated. With the&s;e he arrived at Panama, towards the clo&s;e of the third year from the time of his departure thence. No adventurer of the age &s;uffered hard&s;hips or encountered dangers which equal tho&s;e to which he was expo&s;ed during this long period.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Panama, Pizarro could not prevail on the governor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the conque&s;t of Peru; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">es there|fore &s;ent him to Spain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, where he managed matters more to his own inter|e&s;t than to theirs. On the 26th of July, 1528, Pizarro was appointed governor, captain general, and adelantado of the coun|tries he had di&s;covered and hoped to con|quer, with &s;upreme authority, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">il as well
<PB N="136" REF="025348_0150_0FCD01224EFDD848">as military: thus he &s;ecured to him&s;elf what|ever his boundle&s;s ambition could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>After all the efforts of Pizarro and his a&s;&s;ociates, there &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, with 180 &s;oldiers, 36 of whom were hor&s;emen, com|po&s;ed the whole of the armament. With this contemptible force, in February, 1531, Pizarro did not he&s;itate to &s;ail to invade a great empire.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner landed in Peru, than he began ho&s;tilities, by which imprudent con|duct his followers were expo&s;ed to famine, fatigue, and di&s;ea&s;es of various kinds. However they at lenght reached the prov|ince of Coaque; and having &s;urpi&s;ed the principal &s;ettlement of the natives, they &s;eized there, ve&s;&s;els and ornaments of gold and &s;ilver to the amount of thirty thou&s;and pe&s;os, with other booty of &s;uch value, as di&s;pelled all their fears, and in&s;pired the mo&s;t de&s;ponding with &s;anguine hopes.</P>
<P>The dominions of the &s;overeigns of Peru, at the time that the Spaniards invaded them, extended in length, from north to &s;outh, above fifteen hundred miles along the Pa|cific Ocean. Its breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, was much le&s;s con&s;iderable, being uniform|ly bounded by the va&s;t ridge of the Andes, &s;tretching from its one extremity to the other.</P>
<P>Pizarro, &s;oon after his landing in Peru, di&s;covered that a civil war was carrying on
<PB N="137" REF="025348_0151_0FCD012428B9CBE8">in that country. By the&s;e means he was permitted to pur&s;ue his operations unmo|le&s;ted, and advanced to the centre of a great ompire, before one effort of its power was exerted to &s;top his career. The fir&s;t com|plete information the Spaniards received of this war, was by me&s;&s;engers from Hua&s;car, one of the contending parties, &s;cut to Pi|zarro, in order to &s;olicit his aid again&s;t his opponent Atahualpa. Pizarro at once per|ceived the importance of this intelligence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;aw &s;o clearly all the advantages, which might be derived from this divided &s;tate of the kingdom he had invaded, that without waiting for the reinforcements he expected from Panama, he determined to pu&s;h forward, while inte&s;tine di&s;cord put it out of the power of the Peruvians to at|tack him with their whole force, and while by taking part, as circum&s;tances &s;hould in|cline him, with one of the competitors, he might be enabled with greater ea&s;e to cru&s;h them both.</P>
<P>Strange as it may appear, Pizarro mar|ched into the heart of the country attended by his followers, con&s;i&s;ting only of 62 hor&s;emen, and 102 foot &s;oldiers, of whom twenty were armed with cro&s;s bows, and three with mu&s;kets. Pizarro in the cour&s;e of as march, received an emba&s;&s;ador from the luca of Caramalca, who brought him very valuable pre&s;ents from that Prince, ac|companied
<PB N="138" REF="025348_0152_0FCD01259E456F78">with a pro&s;&s;er of alliance. Pi|zarro according to the u&s;ual artifice of his country men in America promi&s;ed every thing without meaning to fulfil any thing but what his intere&s;t directed. In con&s;e|quence of the&s;e declarations, the Spaniards were permitted to march where they plea|&s;ed.</P>
<P>On entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large court, on one &s;ide of which was a hou&s;e, which the Spani&s;h hi&s;|torians call a palace of the Inca, and on the other a temple of the Sun, the who&s;e &s;urrounded with a &s;trong rampart or wall of earth. When he had po&s;ted his troops in this advantageous &s;ituation, and had &s;een what profu&s;ion of riches the inca po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, Pizarro treacherou&s;ly &s;eized on his per&s;on, during the interview to which the monarch had invited him. While the Inca was en|paged in conference with the Spaniards. Pizarro gave the &s;ignal of a&s;&s;ault. At once the martial mu&s;ick &s;truck up, the cannon and mu&s;kets began to fire, the hor&s;e fallied out fiercely to the charge, and the infantry ru&s;hed on &s;word in hand. The Peruvians a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack which they did not expect, and di&s;mayed which the de&s;tructive effect of fire arms, and the irre&s;i&s;table impre&s;&s;ion of the cavalry, fled with univer&s;al con&s;ternation in eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quarter, without attempring either to annoy
<PB N="139" REF="025348_0153_0FCD0126C43842E0">the enemy, or to defend them&s;elves. Pi|zarro at the head of his followers, advan|ced directly towards the inca; and though his nobles crowded around him with offi|cious zeal, and fell in numbers at his feet, while they vied one with another in &s;acrifi|cing their own lives, that they might cover the &s;acred per&s;on of their king, the Span|iards &s;oon penetrated to the royal feat, and Pizarro &s;eizing the Inca by the arm, drag ged him to the ground, and carried him as a pri&s;oner to his quarters. The fate of the monarch precipitated the flight of his followers. The Spaniards every where pur&s;ued them, and with a deliberate unre|lenting barbarity, continued to &s;laughter the wretched Peruvians, who never attempted to re&s;i&s;t. The carnage did not cea&s;e till the clo&s;e of the day put an end to it, when above four thou&s;and Peruvians lay dead on the &s;pot. Not a &s;ingle Spaniard fell, nor was any one wounded but Pizarro him|&s;elf, who&s;e hand was &s;lightly hurt.</P>
<P>The plunder the Spaniards acquired on this ma&s;&s;acre, was far beyond every thing they had formed in their minds of the wealth of Peru, and they were &s;o tran&s;ported with the value of the acqui&s;ition as well as the great|ne&s;s of their &s;ucce&s;s, that they pa&s;&s;ed the night in tho&s;e extravagant exultations natu|ral to indigent adventurers on &s;o &s;udden a change in their affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="025348_0154_0FCD01284A150A18">
The captive monarch could at fir&s;t hardly believe what he &s;aw to be real, and the dejection into which he &s;unk was in proportion to the height of grandeur from which he had fallen. However, the Inca &s;oon di&s;covered the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the Spaniards, and by applying to that made an attempt to recover his liberty. He offered as a ran&s;om what a&s;toni&s;hed the Spaniards, even after all they now knew concerning the opulence of his kingdom. The apart|ment in which he was confined was twenty-two feet in length, and &s;ixteen in breadth; he underoook to fill it with ve&s;&s;els of gold as high as he could reach. Pizarro eagerly clo&s;ed with this tempting propo&s;al, and a line was drawn upon the wall of the cham|ber, to mark the &s;tipulated height to which the trea&s;ure was to reach.</P>
<P>As fa&s;t as the gold was brought in, it was melted down, except &s;ome pieces of curi|ous fabric, which were re&s;erved as a pre&s;ent for the emperor. After &s;etting apart the fifth due to the crown, and an hundred thou&s;and pe&s;os as a donative to the &s;oldiers, who were ju&s;t arrived with Almagro, there remained 1,528,500 pe&s;os to Pizarro and his followers. The fe&s;tival of St. James, (July 25, 1513) the patron &s;aint of Spain, was the day cho&s;en for the partition of this va&s;t &s;um. Though a&s;&s;embled to divide the &s;poils of an innnocent people procured
<PB N="141" REF="025348_0155_0FCD012AD10CF1C8">by deceit, extortion and cruelty, the tran&s;|action began with a &s;olemn invocation of the name of God, as if they could have expected the guidance of heaven in di&s;tribu|ting tho&s;e wages of iniquity. In this di&s;tri|bution 8000 pe&s;os, at that time not inferior in effective value, to as many pounds her|ling of the pre&s;ent century, fell to the &s;hare of each hor&s;eman, and half that &s;um to each foot &s;oldier.

<P>The Inca having thus fulfilled his en|gagement, demanded his relea&s;e; but the treachery of the Spaniards induced them in&s;tead of &s;etting him at liberty, to put a period to his life. He was tried and con|demned to be burnt alive. At la&s;t the un|fortunate prince con&s;ented to receive bap|ti&s;m, and was therefore indulged with being &s;trangled at the &s;take.</P>
<P>Pizarro, having by the&s;e cruel proceed|ings e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority in Caxamalca, no longer he&s;itated to advance towards Cuzco; and, having received con&s;iderable reinforcements, he could venture, with lit|tle danger to penetrate into the interior part of the country. The Peruvians had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome large bodies of troops to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, and &s;everal fierce en|counters happened; but they terminated like all the actions in America: a few
<PB N="142" REF="025348_0156_0FCD012CBAC30F70">Spaniards were killed or wounded, and the natives were put to flight with incredible &s;laughter. At length Pizarro forced his way to Cuzco, and took quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital. The riches found there, even after all the natives had carried off and concealed, either from a &s;uper&s;titious vene|ration for the ornaments of their temples, or out of hatred to their rapacious con|querors, exceeded in value what had been received as the Inca's ran&s;om. However, as Pizarro's forces were now more nume|rous, the common &s;oldiers did not receive &s;o much as they expected, which proved a di&s;appointment to their rapacity.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e conque&s;ts, Pizarro &s;et out for his native country, and arrived in Spain in 1534. The immen&s;e quantities of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old and &s;ilver which he imported, filled the kingdom with a&s;toni&s;tment. Pizarro was received by the Emperor with the attention due to the bearer of a pre&s;ent &s;o rich, as to exceed any idea the Spaniards had formed concerning the value of their acqui&s;itions in America, even after they had been ten years ma&s;ters of Mexico. Pizarro was admitted into the order of St. Jago. and, after getting his authority confirmed with new powers and privileges, he &s;et out on his return to Peru, accompanied by many per&s;ons of higher rank than had yet &s;erved in that country. Almagro received the
<PB N="143" REF="025348_0157_0FCD012E3AE2AD30">honors he had &s;o long de&s;ired: the title of Adelantado, or governor, was conferred upon him, with juri&s;diction over two hun|dred leagues of the country &s;treching beyond the forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> limits of the province allotted to Pizarro.</P>
<P>On his arival at Peru, he found Almagro in arms oppo&s;ing his intere&s;t, and endeav|oring to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice for the treache|rous conduct of Pizarro, who had engro&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf all the honors and emoluments, which ought to have been divided with his a&s;&s;ociate. However, matters were accom|modated between them. Their new agree|ment was confirmed with the &s;ame power of &s;olemnities as the fir&s;t, and ob&s;erved with as little fidelity.</P>
<P>Cuaco, the capital city of the Incas, was &s;ituated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles from the &s;ea, and much further from Quito, a province of who&s;e value he had formed an high ideas. No other &s;ettlement of the Peruvi|ans was &s;o con&s;iderable as to merit the name of a town, or to allure the Spaniards to fix their re&s;idence in it. Pizarro, in marching through the country, had been &s;truck with the beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive and be&s;t cultivated in Peru. There, on the bank of a &s;mall river of the &s;ame name with the vale which it waters and en|riches

On the 18th of January, 1535, he gave it the name of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndad de los Reyes, either from the circum&s;tance of having laid the fir&s;t &s;tone, at that &s;ea&s;on when the church celebrates the fe&s;tival of the Three Kings, or as is more probable, in honor of Juana and Charles, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;overeigns of Ca&s;tile.

<P>Almagro, as agreed on between him and Pizarro, &s;et out for Chili; but on his march, he met with &s;o many hard&s;hips and difficulties, that many of his men died with fatigue. They no &s;ooner entered on the fertile plains of Chili, than they met with new difficulties to encounter. They there &s;ound a race of men very different from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy,

The Spaniards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and collected &s;ome con&s;iderable quantities of gold, when they were recalled to Peru by an unexpected event.</P>
<P>The Inca of Peru, having ob&s;erved the incon&s;iderate &s;ecurity of the Spaniards in di&s;per&s;ing their troops, and that only a handful of &s;oldiers remained in Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">co, thought that the hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y period was at length come for vindicating his own rights, for avenging the wrongs of his country, and extirpating its oppre&s;&s;ors. The Inca, who was the pri&s;oner of Pi|zarro, obtained permi&s;&s;ion from him to at|tend a great fe&s;tival, which was to be celebrated a few leagues from the capital.

Many Spaniards, living &s;ecurely on the &s;ettlements allotted them, were ma&s;&s;acred. Several detachments, as they marched carele&s;sly through a coun|try which &s;eemed to be tamely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their dominion, were out off to a man. The Spani&s;h writers a&s;&s;ert, that the Pe|ruvian army amounted to 200,000 men, and with this powerful army, and their Inca at the head of it, they laid &s;iege to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uzco. During nine months they carried on the &s;iege with ince&s;&s;ant ardour, and in various forms. The Inca, in &s;pite of the valour of the Spaniards, recovered po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of one half of his capital; and, in their various efforts to drive him out of it, Pizarro lo&s;t one of his brothers, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of note.</P>
<P>Almagro arrived at Cuzco in a critical moment. The Inca at fir&s;t endeavoured to gain the friend&s;hip of Almagro; but af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er many fruitle&s;s overtures, de&s;pairing of any cordial union with a Spaniard, he attacked him by &s;urprize with a numerous body of cho&s;en troops. However, the Spani&s;h di&s;cipline and valour maintained their u&s;ual &s;uperiority. The Peruvians
<PB N="147" REF="025348_0161_0FCD01360AD07A78">were repul&s;ed with &s;uch &s;laughter, that a great part of their army di&s;per&s;ed, and Almagro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had no &s;ooner got rid of their Peruvian enemies, than they began to quarrel among them&s;elves, and the flame at la&s;t bur&s;t out into civil war. Tho' countrymen and friends, the &s;ubjects of the &s;ame &s;overeign, each with the royal &s;tandard di&s;played! and though they be|held the mountains that &s;urrounded the plain in which they were drawn up, cov|ered with a va&s;t multitude of Indians, a&s;&s;embled to enjoy the &s;pectacle of their mutual carnage, and prepared to attack whatever party remained ma&s;ter of the field; &s;o fell and implacable was the ran|cour which had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every brea&s;t, that not one pacific council, not a &s;ingle overture towards accommodation, proceeded from either &s;ide. Almagro was defeated and taken, tried by the Pizarros as guilty of trea&s;on, and condemned and executed, in 1538.</P>
<P>However rapid the progre&s;s of the Spaniards had been in South America &s;ince Pizarro landed in Peru, their avidity of dominion was not yet &s;atisfied. The officers to whom Ferdinand Pizarro gave the command of different detachments,
<PB N="148" REF="025348_0162_0FCD0137595AA578">penetrated into &s;everal new provinces, and though &s;ome of them were expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips in the cold and barren re|gions of the Andes, and others &s;uffered di&s;tre&s;s not inferior amid&s;t the woods and mar&s;hes of the plains, they made di&s;cove|ries, and conque&s;ts which not only extend|ed their knowledge of the country, but added con&s;iderably to the territories of Spain in the New World. Pedro de Val|divia rea&s;&s;umed Almagro's &s;cheme of inva|ding Chili, and notwith&s;tanding the for|titude of the natives in defending their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, made &s;uch progre&s;s in the con|que&s;t of the country, that he founded the city of St. Jago, and gave a begin|ning to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Spani&s;h dominions in that province.</P>
<P>Gonzalo Pizarro, whom his brother Franci&s;co had made governor of Quito, had entru&s;ted one of his confidential offi|cers, named Orellana, with an expedition on di&s;coveries, appointing a proper place where they were to meet; but this young officer began to fancy him&s;elf independ|ent, and, tran&s;ported with the predom|inant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ion of the age, formed &s;chemes of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf as a di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overer, and treacherou&s;ly abandoned his friend and employer.</P>

It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the con&s;ter|nation of Pizarro, when he did not find the bark at the confluence of the Napo and Maragnon, where he had ordered Orellana to wait for him; but that treach|erous &s;ervant, after having made &s;ome di&s;coveries, got back to Spain, and there magnified his wonderful exploits. In the mean time, Pizarro was twelve hundred miles from Quito; and, in that long march towards the capital, the Spaniards encountered hard&s;hips greater than tho&s;e they had endured in their progre&s;s out|ward, without the alluring hopes that then foothed and animated them under their &s;uperings. Hunger compelled them to feed on roots and berries, to eat all their dogs and hor&s;es, to devour the mo&s;t loath&s;ome reptiles, and even to knaw the leather of their &s;addles and &s;word belts. Four thou&s;and Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards peri&s;hed in this wild and di&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erous expedition, which con|tinued near two years.

In this young man the Al|magrians found a point of union which they wanted, and looking up to him as their head, were ready to undertake any thing to promote his intere&s;t. Their af|fection for Almagro was not the only in|citement, being urged on by their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Many of them, de&s;titute of common nece&s;&s;aries, and weary of loiter|ing away life a burden to their chief, or to &s;uch of their a&s;&s;ociates as had &s;aved &s;ome remnant of their fortune from pil|lage and confi&s;cation &s;ighed for an occa&s;ion to exert their activity and courage, and

<P>On Sunday, the 6th of June, 1541, at midnight, the &s;ea&s;on of tranquility and repo&s;e in all &s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry climates, Harada, at the head of eighteen of the mo&s;t determin|ed con&s;pirators, &s;allied out of Almagro's hou&s;e in complete armour, and drawing their &s;words, ha&s;tily advanced towards Pi|zarro's hou&s;e.

The governor, who&s;e &s;teady mind no form of danger could alter, &s;tarting up, called for arms, and commanded Franci&s;co de Chaves to make fa&s;t the door: but that officer, who did not retain &s;o much pre&s;ence of mind as to obey this prudent order, running to the top of the &s;tairca&s;e, wildly a&s;ked the con&s;pirators what they meant, and whither they were going.

Some of the per&s;ons who were there threw them&s;elves from the windows, others attempted to fly, and a few, drawing their &s;words, followed their leader into an inner apartment. The con|&s;pirators, animated with having the object of their vengeance now in view, ru&s;hed forward after them. Pizarro, with no other arms than his &s;word and buckler, defended the entry, and &s;upported by his half brother Aleantara, and his little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal con|te&s;t with intrepidity worthy of his pa&s;t exploits and with the vigour of a youthful combatant. "Courage, (he cried) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om|panions, we are yet enow to make tho&s;e traitors recent of their audacity."

On the 16th of September, 1542, they met at Chupaz, about two hundred miles from Cuzco, and fought with all the fierce animo&s;ity in&s;pired by the violence of civil rage, the rancour of private en|mity, the eagerne&s;s of revenge, and the la&s;t efforts of de&s;pair.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now taken a review of the conque&s;t of the two great empires of Mexico and Peru, very little more &s;eems worthy of notice in the Hi&s;tory of South America than to mention a &s;ew circum&s;tances relative to their political in&s;titutions and national manners.</P>
<P>According to the account of the Mexi|cans them&s;elves, their empire was not of long continuance. They relate, that their country was originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, rather than peopled, by &s;mall independent tribes, who&s;e manners and mode of life re&s;embled tho&s;e of the rude&s;t &s;avages in South Amer|ica. About a period corre&s;ponding to the beginning of the tenth century in the Chri&s;t|ian aera, &s;everal tribes moved in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive migrations from unknown regions towards the north and north we&s;t, and &s;ettled in dif|ferent provinces of Ana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the ancient name of New Spain. The&s;e, more civili|zed than the original inhabitants, began to form them to the arts of &s;ocial life. At length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth century, the Mexicans, a people more poli&s;hed than any of the former, ad|vanced from the borders of the Californian gulf and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plains adja|cent to a great lake near the centre of the
<PB N="161" REF="025348_0176_0FCD0153CCBF2B18">country. After re&s;iding there about fifty years they founded a town, &s;ince di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which from humble beginnings &s;oon grew to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after they were e&s;tabli&s;hed in their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, continued, like other martial tribes in America, unacquaint|ed with regal dominion; and were governed in peace, and conducted in war, by &s;uch as were entitled to pre-eminence by their wi&s;|dom or their valour. Among them, as in other &s;tates, who&s;e power and territories become exten&s;ive, the &s;upreme authority centred at la&s;t in a &s;ingle per&s;on: and when the Spaniards under Cortes invaded the country, Montezuma was the ninth mon|arch in order, who had &s;wayed the Mexi|can &s;ceptie, not by hereditary right, but by election. Such is the traditional tale of the Mexicans concerning the progre&s;s of their own empire, which, according to this account, mu&s;t have been but of &s;hort dura|tion.</P>
<P>While the juri&s;diction of the Mexican monarchs was limited, it is probable that much o&s;tentation was not exerci&s;ed; but as their authority became more exten&s;ive, the &s;plendour of their government encrea&s;ed. It was in this la&s;t &s;tate the Spaniards beheld it, and &s;truck with the appearance of Mon|tezuma's court, they de&s;cribe its pomp at
<PB N="162" REF="025348_0177_0FCD0155394C7118">great length, and with much admiration. The number of his attendants, the order, the &s;ilence, and the reverence with which they &s;erved him; the va&s;t extent of his roy|al man&s;ion, the variety of apartments allot|ed to different officers, and the o&s;tentation with which his grandeur was di&s;played whenever he permitted his &s;ubjects to be|hold him, &s;eem to re&s;emble the magnificence of the ancient monarchies in A&s;ia, rather than the &s;implicity of the infant &s;tates in the New World.</P>
<P>The Mexicans like the rude tribes among them, were ince&s;&s;antly engaged in war, and the motives that prompted them to ho&s;tili|ties &s;eem to have been the &s;ame. They fought in order to gratify their vengeance, by &s;hedding the blood of their enemies. In battle, they were chiefly intent on taking pri&s;oners, and it was by the number of the&s;e that they e&s;timated the glory of victory. No captives were ever ran&s;omed or &s;pared: all were &s;acrificed without mercy, and their fle&s;h devoured with the &s;ame barbarous joy as among the fierce&s;t &s;avages. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, it ro&s;e to even wilder exce&s;&s;es. Their principal warriors covered them&s;elves with the &s;kins of the unhappy victims, and danced about the &s;treets, boa&s;ting of their own valour, and exulting over their ene|mies.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="025348_0178_0FCD01571A62BED8">
Their funeral rites were no le&s;s bloody than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;avage tribes. On the death of any di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onage, e&s;pecially of the emperor, &s;everal of his at|tendants were cho&s;en to accompany him to the other world, and the&s;e unfortunate vic|tims were put to death without mercy, and buried in the &s;ame tomb.</P>
<P>Though the agriculture of the Mexicans was more exten&s;ive than that of the roving tribes, who tru&s;ted chiefly to their bow for food, it &s;eems not to have &s;upplied them with &s;uch &s;ub&s;i&s;tence as men require when engaged in efforts of active indu&s;try. The Spaniards appear not to have been &s;truck with any &s;uperiority of the Mexicans over the other people of America in bodily vigor. Both, according to their ob&s;ervation, were of &s;uch a feeble frame as to be unable to endure fatigue, and the &s;trength of one Spaniard exceeded that of &s;everal indians. This they imputed to their &s;canty diet, on poor fare, &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve life, but not to give firmne&s;s to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In Mexico, though the di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;es was &s;omewhat orderly, yet the &s;truc|ture of the greater part of them was mean. Nor does the fabric of their temples, and other public edifices, appear to have been &s;uch as entitled them to the high prai&s;es be&s;towed upon them by many Spani&s;h an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hors. The great temple of Mexico, the
<PB N="164" REF="025348_0179_0FCD0159732F31F8">mo&s;t famous in New Spain, which has been repre&s;ented as a magnificent building, rai&s;ed to &s;uch a height, that the a&s;cent to it was by a &s;tairca&s;e of an hundred and fourteen &s;teps, was a &s;olid ma&s;s of earth of a &s;quare form, faced partly with &s;tone. Its ba&s;e on each &s;ide extended ninety feet, and decrea&s;|ing gradually as it advanced in height, it ter|minated in a quadrangle of about thirty feet, where were placed a inrine of the deity, and two altars on which the victims were &s;acri|ficed. Greater &s;kill and ingenuity were di&s;|played, if we may believe me Spanith hi&s;|torians, in the hou&s;es of the emperor, and in tho&s;e of the principal nobility. There &s;ome elegance of de&s;ign was vi&s;ible, and a commodious arrangement of the apartments was attended to; but if buildings corre&s;|ponding to &s;uch de&s;criptions had ever ex|i&s;ted in the Mexican cities, it is probable that &s;ome remains of them would &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l be vi&s;ible. As only two centuries and an half have elap&s;ed &s;ince the conque&s;t of New Spain, it &s;eems altogether incredible, that in a period &s;o &s;hort every ve&s;tige of this boa&s;ted elegance and grandeur &s;hould have di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The Mexicans have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n repre&s;ented, perhaps, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous than they really were; their re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers, and the rives of their wor&s;hip, are dei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bed as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el in an ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eme degree.

<PB N="165" REF="025348_0180_0FCD015A78B0B9D0">&s;uper&s;tition in Mexico was gloomy and frightful; its divini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies were cloathed with terror, and delighted in vengeance. They were exhibited to the people under dete&s;ta|ble forms, which created horror. The fi|gures of &s;erpents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ygers, and other de|&s;tructive animals, decorated their temples. Fea&s;ts, mortifications, and penances, all ri|gid, and many of them excruciating to an ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eme degree, were the means employed to appeale the wrath of their gods, and the Mexicans never approached their altars without &s;prinkling them with blood drawn from their bodies; but of all offerings, hu|man &s;acrifices were deemed the mo&s;t accept|able.</P>
<P>The empire of <HI>Peru</HI> boa&s;ts of an higher antiquity than that of Mexico. According to the traditionary accounts collected by the Spaniards, it had &s;ub&s;i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed near four hund|red years under twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs; but the knowledge of their ancient &s;tory, which the Peruvians could communicate to their conquerors, mu&s;t have been both imperfect and uncertain. Like the other American nations, they were totally unac|quainted with the art of writing, and de&s;ti|tute of the only means, by which the mem|ory of pa&s;t tran&s;actions can be pre&s;erved with any degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>The authority of the Inca was unlimited and ab&s;olute, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive mean|ing
<PB N="166" REF="025348_0181_0FCD015BF83B5ED8">of the words. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver the decrees of a prince are con&s;idered as the commands of the divinity, it is not only an act of re|bellion, but of impiety, to di&s;pute or op|po&s;e his will. Obedience becomes a duty of religion; and as it would be profane to controul a monarch under the guidance of heaven, and pre&s;umptuous to advi&s;e him, nothing remains but to &s;ubmit with implicit re&s;pect. This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the effect of every government e&s;tabli&s;hed on preten|&s;ions of intercour&s;e with &s;uperior powers. Such accordingly was the blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which the Peruvians yielded to their &s;ove|reign.</P>
<P>The Incas of Peru were immen&s;ely rich in gold and &s;ilver, long before they knew any thing of the rich &s;ilver mines of Poto&s;i, which were accidentally di&s;covered in the year 1545, by an indian, as he was clamber|ing up the mountains in pur&s;uit of a Llama which had &s;trayed from his flock. Soon after the mines of Sacotecas in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were o|pened. From that time &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;cov|eries have been made in both colonies, and &s;ilver mines are now &s;o numerous, that the working of them, and of &s;ome few mines of gold in the province of Tierra Firme, and the new kingdom of Grenada, has be|come the capital occupation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Span|iards, and is reduced into a &s;y&s;tem no le&s;s complicated than intere&s;ting.</P>

To return: the wars in which the Incas engaged, were carried on with a &s;pirit very different from tho&s;e of other American na|tions. They fought not like &s;avages, to de|&s;troy or extirminate, or, like the Mexicans, to glut bloodthir&s;ly divinities with human &s;acrifices. They conquered in order to re|claim and civilize the vanqui&s;hed, and to infu&s;e the knowledge of their own in&s;titu|tions and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

The Incas took the peo|ple whom they &s;ubdued under their protec|tion, and admitted them to a participation of all the advantages enjoyed by their orig|inal &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In Peru, agriculture, the art of primary nece&s;&s;ity in &s;ocial life, was more exten&s;ive, and carried on with greater &s;kill, than in any other part of America. The Span|iards, in their progre&s;s through the country, were &s;o full &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of ev|ery kind, that in the relation of their ad|ventures we meet with few of tho&s;e di&s;mal &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ioned by famine, in which the conquerors of Mexico were &s;o often involved. The quantity of &s;oil under cultivation was not left to the di&s;cretion of imdividuals, but regulated by public author|ity, in proportion to the exigencies of the community. Even the calamity of an un|fruitful

<P>The ingenuity of the Peruvians was al&s;o con&s;picuous in the con&s;truction of their hou&s;es and public buildings. In the exten&s;ive plains which &s;tretch along the pacific o|cean, where the &s;ky is perpetually &s;erene, and the climate mild, their hou&s;es were very properly built only of &s;light materials; but in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ea&s;ons are known, and their rigor felt, hou&s;es were con&s;tructed with greater &s;olidity. They were generally of a &s;quare form, the walls about eight feet high, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with bricks hardened is the &s;on, without any windows, and the door low and &s;trait. Sim|ple as the&s;e &s;tructures were, and rude as the materials may &s;eem to be, of which they were formed, they were &s;o cur|able, that many of them &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in different parts of Peru, long after every monument that might have con|veyed to us any idea of the dome&s;tic &s;tate of the other A|merican nations, has vani&s;hed from the face of the earth. It was in the temples con&s;ecrated to the Sun, and in the buildings de&s;tined for the re&s;idence of their monarchs, that the Peruvians di&s;played the utmo&s;t extent of their art and contrivance. The de&s;criptions of them by &s;ome of the Spani&s;h writers, who had an opportunity of contemplat|ing them, while, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, entire, might have appeared highly exaggerated, if the ruins which &s;till re|main did not vouch the truth of their relations.</P>
