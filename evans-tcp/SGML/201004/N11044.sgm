<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XXVIII.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By his Excellency THOMAS SHAW, PROTECTOR and DEFENDER of MAGNA CHARTA, and the BILL of RIGHTS.</BYLINE>
<HEAD><HI>A</HI> PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the infatuated multitudes of royal Neronian dependants, catamites, pimps, and para&s;ites, too many to be enumerated; have long conducted them|&s;elves as parricides and traitors in a fatal progre&s;&s;ion of crimes again&s;t the con&s;titutional liberties of the Briti&s;h empire, and have at length proceeded to avowed and open rebellion again&s;t the laws of the land, and the lives of Engli&s;hmen in England and America, and the good effects which were expected to ari&s;e from the patience and lenity of the people, have been often fru&s;trated, and remon&s;trance proved ineffectual and now rendered hopele&s;s, from the ob&s;tinacy and cruelty of the &s;overeign, by the in|fluence of their infernal coun&s;els, and confederacy, it only remains for the people, who have the &s;u|preme power, as well for the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e guilty parricides, as for the protection of the inno|cent, to prove they do not bear the &s;word in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="013994_0002_0F92592CA0AAB390">
The infringements which have been committed upon the &s;acred rights of Magna Charta, and the people of Great-Britain and America, are too many to enumerate on one fide, and all too attrocious, too infamous, and too diabolical to be palliated on the other. All unprejudiced, unpen&s;ioned, and un|placed Engli&s;hmen, who have been witne&s;s, (or even heard) of the late tran&s;actions, in this kingdom and America, will find, upon a tran&s;ient review, marks of premeditation and con&s;piracy to de&s;troy the con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, that would ju&s;tify the fullne&s;s of cha&s;ti&s;ement; and even tho&s;e who are lea&s;t acquainted with facts, cannot fail to receive a ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the enormity, in pro|portion as they di&s;cover the arts and a&s;&s;iduity, by which their bloody de&s;igns have been fal&s;ified and concealed. Tho&s;e parricides, the authors of the pre&s;ent bloody mea&s;ures and unnatural revolt from the laws, never daring to tru&s;t their cau&s;e, or their actions, to the judgment of an impartial public, or even to the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reflection of their followers and adherents, have uniformly placed their chief confidence in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of truth; and while indefatigable and &s;hamele&s;s pains have been taken to de&s;troy the real intere&s;t of the people of England and America, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t forgeries, calumnies, and ab&s;urdities, that ever in&s;ulted human under&s;tanding, have been impo&s;ed upon their credulity, by the King, and tho&s;e mi&s;creants. The Pre&s;s, that di|&s;tingui&s;hed appendage of public liberty, and when fairly and impartially employed, its be&s;t &s;upport, has been invariably pro&s;tituted by tho&s;e pen&s;ioned ra&s;cals, Hume, John&s;on, Kelly, Shebbeare, and other mini&s;terial hirelings, to the mo&s;t contrary
<PB N="231" REF="013994_0003_0F92592D40A632E0">purpo&s;es. The animated language of ancient and viriuous times, calculated to vindicate and promote the ju&s;t rights and intere&s;ts of mankind, have been applied by the King's minions, to countenance the mo&s;t abandoned violations of tho&s;e &s;acred ble&s;&s;ings and not only from the flagitious mini&s;terial prints, but from the &s;lavi&s;h harangues of pro&s;tituted Peers, and venal Senetors, men have been taught to de|pend upon activity in &s;hedding of blood, for the &s;ecurity of their places, pen&s;ions, and per&s;ons, till to complete the horrid profanation of terms and of ideas, the name of God has been introduced in addre&s;&s;es and in the pulpit, by a groupe of rotten Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, to excite deva&s;tation and ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>The minds of men, &s;uch as Gage, Percy, Bur|goyne, Clinton, and Howe, and the King's mer|cenary &s;oldiers, having been thus gradually prepa|red for murder, a number of armed troops to the amount of eighteen hundred, and upwards, on the 19th of April la&s;t, at Concord, cowardly attacked about &s;ixty peaceable Americans, who not expect|ing &s;o con&s;umate an act of &s;avage barbarity, unpre|pared for vengeance, and willing to decline it, made u&s;e of their arms only in their own defence. Since that period, the mercenaries, deriving confi|dence from impunity, have added in&s;ult to outrage; have repeatedly fired upon, and barbarou&s;ly killed many of their fellow &s;ubjects with cannon and &s;mall arms; and with a prepo&s;terous parade of military arrangement, they try to frighten, and mean if po&s;|&s;ible to en&s;lave America, while part, of their body make daily and indi&s;criminate inva&s;ions upon private property, and with a wantonne&s;s of cruelty, peculiar in this reign, and ever incident to lawle&s;s power,
<PB N="232" REF="013994_0004_0F92593137F55528">carry depradation and di&s;tre&s;s where ever they turn their &s;teps. The action of the 19th of April, and the cruel, bloody, and inhuman circum&s;tances at|tending that day's carnage, are of &s;uch notoriety, as mu&s;t baffle all attempts to contradict them; and the flames of buildings, the cries of helple&s;s infirm old men, women and children, wantonly &s;laughter'd in cold blood, &s;pread, and will for ever &s;tand a me|lancholy confirmation of the &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>In this exigency of Neronian cruelty and com|plicated calamities I avail my&s;elf of the la&s;t efforts within the bounds of my duty, as a peaceable &s;ub|ject, to &s;pare the effu&s;ion of blood; to offer, and I do hereby, in the name of the whole people of England and America, offer and promi&s;e a mo&s;t gracious pardon, to all the mercenaries who &s;hall forthwith lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable &s;ubjects and faithful Engli&s;hmen, loyal to the laws and the con&s;titution, excepting only from &s;uch pardon, John Stuart, Earl of Bute, and William Lord Mansfield, the authors and pro|moters of blood&s;hed and cruelty, who&s;e crimes are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other con&s;ideration than that of condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And to the end that no per&s;on within the limits of this proferred mercy may plead ignorance of the con&s;equences of refu&s;ing it, I by the&s;e pre&s;ents pro|claim not only the per&s;ons above named and ex|cepted, but al&s;o their adherents, a&s;&s;ociates, and abettors, meaning to comprehend in tho&s;e terms, all and every per&s;on and per&s;ons, of what cla&s;s, de|nomination, or de&s;cription &s;oever, who have ap|peared in arms again&s;t the &s;acred laws and con&s;ti|tution of the Briti&s;h empire, and &s;hall not lay down
<PB N="233" REF="013994_0005_0F925932A801DDF8">the &s;ame as afore&s;aid; and likewi&s;e all &s;uch as &s;hall &s;o take up arms after the date hereof, or who &s;hall in any wi&s;e protect or conceal &s;uch offenders, or a&s;&s;i&s;t them with money, provi&s;ions, cattle, arms, am|munition, carriages, or any other nece&s;&s;iry for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence or defence, or &s;hall hold &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence with the mercenary murderers, by letter, me&s;&s;age, &s;ignal, or otherwi&s;e, to be rebels and trai|tors to the Briti&s;h cou&s;titution, and as &s;uch to be treated.</P>
<P>And whereas, during the continuance of the pre|&s;ent bloody and unnatural civil war in America, ju&s;|tice cannot be obtained by the common law of the land, the cour&s;e whereof has for a long time pa&s;t been violently impeded, and wholly interrupted by the King and his paracidial minions and military cut throats, from whence re&s;ults a nece&s;&s;ity, in or|der to pre&s;erve the dear bought rights of Engli&s;h|men and hallowed con&s;titution of the empire, for u&s;ing and exerci&s;ing the Lex Talionis or Law of Retaliation; I have therefore thought fit by the authority inve&s;ted in me by Magna Charta as a Freeman, to publi&s;h, and I do hereby publi&s;h, pro|claim, and order the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the Lex Talionis, or Blood for Blood, within and through|out Great-Britain and America, &s;o long as the pre|&s;ent unhappy occa&s;ion &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily require, till the &s;ons of freedom &s;hall gain a deci&s;ive victory over tyranny and lawle&s;s power, till each parricide and traitor &s;hall be brought to the block or the gal|lows, or otherwi&s;e fall a &s;acrifice by the hands of a much injured and enraged people, and till the li|berties of England and America are &s;ettled upon a &s;ure and la&s;ting foundation, not to be again &s;haken
<PB N="234" REF="013994_0006_0F92593341380300">by any tyrant of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick; where|of all true Engli&s;hmen are hereby required to take notice, and arm them&s;elves&mdash;with a re&s;olution as well to maintain their rights, as to re&s;i&s;t, encounter and &s;ubdue the mercenaries and traitors above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>To the&s;e inevitable, but I tru&s;t &s;alutary mea&s;ures, it is of a far more plea&s;ing part of my duty to add the a&s;&s;urances of protection and &s;upport to all who in &s;o trying a Cri&s;is &s;hall manife&s;t no allegiance to tyrants, but an affection for the &s;acred con&s;titution of their country; So that &s;uch per&s;ons as may have been induced to join in the pre&s;ent royal and mini|&s;terial mea&s;ures for de&s;troying the laws, liberties, and lives of their fellow-&s;ubjects in America, may return to their re&s;pective callings and profe&s;&s;ions, be no longer the in&s;truments of murder and public ruin, but &s;tand di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from the par|ricides of the con&s;titution, till God in his mercy &s;hall turn the hearts of tyrants, and re&s;tore peace to this di&s;tracted land, now polluted with innocent blood.</P>

<P><HI>Notwith&s;tanding the Royal lying Gazette has given us an account, &s;igned by that bloody mon&s;ter in human &s;hape, Gen. Gage, of another ma&s;&s;acre in America, on the</HI> 17th <HI>of June la&s;t, wherein this modern Kirk exto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">s his officers and mer|cenary &s;oldiers, &s;timulated by liquor, and promi&s;es of plunder,
<PB N="235" REF="013994_0007_0F925934089FE6A8">to &s;laughter their fellow &s;ubjects, for their valour and bra|very, and boa&s;ts his having gained &s;omething like a victory, over the brave and virtuous Americans, fighting for liberty, whom that wretch calls rebels; yet the Public may depend this pretended &s;uperiority of his troops, conduct of his offi|cers, and mighty victory is a LYE; and it will &s;oon be proved, from unquestionable authority, that he has lo&s;t &s;ome hundreds of his men, more than is mentioned in the Gazette, which contains the mo&s;t notorious fal&s;hoods, and infamous impo&s;itions on the Public, calculated to deceive the people here, and to &s;pirit up the few remaining troops we have in England, to embark with the greater readine&s;s to the field of &s;laughter in America, there to fall a ju&s;t &s;acrifice to the injured laws, and glorious liberties of the Brti&s;h empire: It will likewi&s;e appear that Gen. Gage's army with all the advantage of artillery, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal &s;hips of war, and armed ve&s;&s;els, was obliged to retreat to their barracks and &s;neaking holes in Bo&s;ton, under the protection of the men of war.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it was ever nece&s;&s;ary to rou&s;e the &s;leeping genius of England, to excite a generous emulation of our warlike fore|fathers and to animate every Briton, by their example, to fight valiantly, to conquer nobly, or peri&s;h gloriou&s;ly in de|fence of his country&mdash;This is certainly the time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it was ever nece&s;&s;ary for the people of England to ri&s;e altogether as one man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a torrent on the bloody tyrannical invaders of their lives and liberties, and over|whelm them in the mid&s;t of their fancied in&s;olent &s;ecurity&mdash;it is &s;urely at this time.</HI></P>
<P>If it was ever nece&s;&s;ary for the people to enter into an a&s;&s;ociation, to expre&s;s and fully explain in a Manife&s;to the cau&s;es of their di&s;content; and to declare they take up arms to put a &s;top to the en|croachments of tho&s;e who govern in the King's name; to bring to condign puni&s;hment the betray|ers of their country; to pre&s;erve their rights and li|berties from farther violations; to re&s;tore the laws
<PB N="236" REF="013994_0008_0F925934CC6E7EC0">and the con&s;titution now tottering to its ba&s;e, to their pri&s;tine vigour; to prevent the inhuman &s;laughter of their fellow &s;ubjects in America by the hand of lawle&s;s power; to enforce a due obedience to Magna Charta from the King and his mini&s;ters; to oblige his Maje&s;ty to di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e parricides and traitors who &s;urround his throne, and to re&s;tore the ancient independence and freedom of parliaments: If &s;uch a mea&s;ure was ever nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the people and kingdom from &s;lavery and ruin.&mdash;it is NOW. But alas! It is (I fear) in vain to appeal to the rea&s;on or to the pa&s;&s;ions of Engli&s;hmen, they &s;eem to have lo&s;t their very nature and genius, they &s;eem to have forgot the arts of war, and the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom; they have fatally degenerated into luxury and vice, and at la&s;t become in&s;en&s;ible to every generous &s;entiment of public liberty; they have lo&s;t the virtue, the courage, and bravery of their glorious ance&s;tors; and are now looked upon by &s;urrounding nations, as a herd of pu&s;illanimous drones, devoted to &s;lavery, or doomed to de&s;truction.</P>
