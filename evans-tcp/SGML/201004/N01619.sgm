Prayer is the breathing forth of holy De&s;ires, or, lifting up the Soul unto God, or asking the Things we need from God, in and by Chri&s;t, accor|ding to His Holy Will, not without Confe&s;&s;ions, and Thanksgiving. This Work mu&s;t have Time, Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Compo&s;ure: And this take undoub|tedly, <HI>That Prayers can never fly high, where the Per&s;on is not accepted; can have no &s;trength without Faith:</HI> About this Duty, I mu&s;t let you know, There are Three Mi&s;carriages u&s;ually.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Before the Duty, <HI>Unprepared|ne&s;s, Un&s;uitablene&s;s,</HI> Reaking hot out of the World, Self, Sin, into that Service; as if Men could leap into Gods Bo&s;om, out of the Devils Lap: Before Prayer you need to &s;tudy God, your &s;elf, and the <HI>Way to Him,</HI> John 6. You need to take a time when He is mo&s;t like to hear, even when He is inditing for you, and puts <HI>Words into your mouth,</HI> Ho&s;. 14.</P>
<P>The Second Failer in Prayer is, <HI>When you do not Watch to Prayer.</HI> O the Hur|reys of our Hearts: the Thorowfare that

<P><PB N="11" REF="001923_0015_0FBA1CD3E076C698">My Advice is, That mainly <HI>you Watch your &s;elf in what you are, And where you are:</HI> The&s;e Two go far in your Watch; to &s;ee your &s;elf in a good E&s;tate; And to be where you &s;hould be in your Duty and Employ|ment, argues a curious Eye, and a careful Head: But to be very accurate in your Watch, and to keep off from trouble&s;ome Annears, keep a Book by you (I mean it literally) in which, e|very Night before you &s;leep, you &s;et down on the one &s;ide, the Lords gra|cious Providence and Dealings with you; and your Dealings with Him on the other &s;ide: This Watch well kept, &s;its for Prayer, Fa&s;tings, Sabbath, Sacraments, and Death; upon which Judgment follows.</P>

<P N="6">6. For thy growth in Grace, I am the more zealous, becau&s;e (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.8.) the Apo&s;tle propounded it as a Cure again&s;t all the <HI>Errors of the wicked.</HI> For this al&s;o there are divers helps, as M. <HI>Symmons</HI> his Cure to <HI>Distre&s;&s;ed Con&s;cien|ces,</HI> (a Choice Piece) and many others. But this you mu&s;t know, that all la|bour tends not to growth; no more than Ants grow in bulk, though very much in labour; Every great Hearer is not a great Grower: Nay, a tree may grow in parts, though not in all. Grow &s;oundly in the Root <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of his Grace, and then you will not grow as Weeds do, but
<PB N="13" REF="001923_0017_0FBA1CD796785990">
as good Grain. To which purpo&s;e I advi&s;e you, to ob&s;erve what you gain again&s;t Corruption, and &s;o much you may hope, you may thrive in Grace; as the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Saul.</HI> Do not therefore keep the De|vils Coun&s;el; but let &s;ome able Friend <HI>Watch</HI> you, to whom communicate your Decays or Growth. When a Ship is ob&s;erved by a Land-mark, her way is ea&s;ily ob&s;erved. Therefore mind much this one thing, in all make much of a Rule, and keep to it; as few under the warm Go&s;pel but know whether they be Hypocrites or otherwi&s;e. Even &s;o you &s;hall feel your Growth. An old &s;tock will not &s;erve turn (which hath been the delu&s;ion of many) when every day needs new Incomes of the Spirit, and &s;o advance|ment to Heaven.</P>
<P>Long to grow, &s;trive to grow; be|wail decayes: grow in both the Ta|bles Duties.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle tells us of growth from Vertue; yea, at la&s;t to Patience by Affliction, if we hear the Rod, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;ts method is, He hath all Grace. He giveth out what He plea&s;eth; He
<PB N="14" REF="001923_0018_0FBA1CDE56D72330">
maintains what He gives&punc; He perfects what He maintains; He Crowns what He perfects: And thus Chri&s;t loves you, more than ever you could hate Him, without who&s;e watering by His Blood you can never grow. The be&s;t Evidence of Growth, is to grow more Humble, more Holy, at|tend that well: and &s;ee how it is from Meal to Meal, from one Sabbath to a|nother, one Sermon to another: are you fed or &s;urfeited? A very very little Grace (if true) is &s;aving: a little Growth (if right) is comforting: Be|lieve and Live, Believe and Grow; all decayes come through want of Faith: to fetch Blood from the Life Vein, the Lord Chri&s;t.

<P>But this you will certainly find, That if the&s;e People would &s;peak out, they have changed their Opinions a|bout God, before they change about His Ways.

<P>Secondly, Enquire whether they have been carried more to God and Holine&s;s &s;ince their change. For that which comes from God, will carry us to God: but if only to <HI>Pride, Cen&s;uring, Liberti&s;m, &amp;c.</HI> you know what to make of it.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h we may judge right judgment of all men, and things.</P>
<P>But a little Practically to ca&s;t in &s;ome|thing to profit you:</P>
<P>The Grace &s;o &s;poken of, &s;hould main|ly be minded as the Root and Fruits of the New Covenant, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. and that in <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 2.19, 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which you will find lie upon two Parties, <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the poor <HI>Believer;</HI> and Chri&s;t to be con|&s;idered in a double Act of his:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, In his loving, or rather mani|fe&s;ting
<PB N="58" REF="001923_0062_0FBA2D9C8F2FEC98">
his love, in time to the &s;oul, And,</P>
<P>Secondly, In pa&s;&s;ing over that Right he hath in him&s;elf to the believing &s;oul.</P>
<P>An&s;werable whereunto, the &s;oul fir&s;t from Chri&s;ts love is warm'd to love again; and from his bounty in his &s;e|cond Act, turns over all the &s;oul hath to the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> whether Name, E&s;tate, Wit, Parts, yea all its Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now Chri&s;t thus loving the &s;oul, and giving him&s;elf upon no Meritori|ous or procuring Cau&s;e on the &s;ouls &s;ide, is called <HI>Free Grace</HI> indeed; when the Father &s;hall freely give his Son, and the Son freely his Heart-blood, and the Spirit freely all its operations, and make a free Covenant of grace and mercy to pardon all &s;in, to receive a &s;inner into his bo&s;om, <HI>without money or price;</HI> nay not to offer any thing of his own, either Duty, or Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.1. this call <HI>Free Grace:</HI> though when Chri&s;t comes to manife&s;t this, he (by the Law) gets Parly with the &s;inner he means to &s;ave, by &s;ome uncouth wayes, and often very cro&s;s to fle&s;h and blood, which makes the work hard to judge of at fir&s;t: yet be

a&s;&s;ured that the whole work will be Free, in the whole Frame of it.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e this point is of &s;uch &s;ingular concernment, and that I have formerly delighted to &s;peak to others touching the &s;ame, and would have the comfort of it my &s;elf, I &s;hall let you know what I know about the or|der of the working hereof, that you mi&s;take not.</P>
<P N="26">26. And in the letting you in this Light, to give you the &s;um of true practical Divinity: and therefore ob|&s;erve with diligence, That when a di&s;covery is made of this Love to the Sinnes, the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> makes a double approach to the Soul; the fir&s;t is by the Law, where he takes three &s;teps: And fir&s;t, by the Law he &s;tops the Sinner in his cour&s;e, and makes him to &s;ee Sin in the very nature of it, not in the Hell only, and con&s;equence; but in that it &s;eparates the Soul from the greate&s;t good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.7. And, Secondly, makes the &s;oul bear the burthen, and weight of it, which makes <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf cry out often, and &s;o others: It pincheth hard where &s;in hath got time and &s;trength,
<PB N="60" REF="001923_0064_0FBA2DA0CB0A2048">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thirdly, it lets the &s;oul to know, that he is not able to &s;atisfie Divine ju&s;tice, and &s;o the Law may be called a <HI>School-ma&s;ter</HI> to Chri&s;t though the Text leads to the <HI>Ceremonial;</HI> the <HI>Cere|monies</HI> being the Go&s;pel of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The&s;e three &s;teps of Love Chri&s;t takes in the Law by his fir&s;t approach.</P>
<P>Secondly, In his Go&s;pel-approach he takes the&s;e &s;teps:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He holds forth him&s;elf to the &s;inner, a Mediator of the New Cove|nant, and a free pardon of &s;in, this keeps the &s;oul from de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Secondly, He lets you know that he is as able, and as willing as ever to do it, <HI>Colo&s;.</HI> 1.19. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This keeps the &s;oul in heart and hope.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By that which they call the Reflex Act, he brings home a par|ticular Promi&s;e of Grace to the &s;oul, as <HI>Revel.</HI> 3.17. and the Spirit of Chri&s;t thus argues:</P>
<P><HI>He that is athir&s;t mu&s;t freely come.</HI></P>
<P>But (&s;ayes the Spirit) <HI>Thou art thir&s;ty,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore come freely.</HI></P>

<P>Thus the Spirit of <HI>Humiliation</HI> fir&s;t wakens a mi&s;erable lo&s;t &s;inner, and that by the Law, and can only bring him to the Gate: Then <HI>Vocation</HI> opens the Door: Then <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> puts on Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s: <HI>Sancti|fication</HI> teacheth him how to walk, taking away the Power of &s;in: <HI>Adop|tion</HI> makes him a Brother, and gives him his Privileges: And <HI>Glory</HI> begun here in part, by &s;anctifying, &s;hews him his e&s;tate.
