<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FUTURE generations will per|haps view the late revolution in North America, as the mo&s;t &s;ingular phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political hemi&s;phere of any na|tion.</P>
<P>To point out the gradual &s;teps by which America finally obtained her independence, to de&s;cribe tho&s;e terrible &s;cenes of rapine, blood, and &s;laughter, which accompanied tho&s;e &s;truggles, &s;o fatal to thou&s;ands of brave officers and men on both &s;ides, and &s;o ruinous to the &s;inances of the mother-country, are principally the objects of this epitome.</P>
<P>In the execution of this bu&s;ine&s;s, we have endeavored to dive&s;t our|&s;elves of every &s;park of national prej|udice, and have therefore contented our&s;elves with barely relating facts, without pre&s;uming to give our opin|ion
<PB REF="025347_0004_0FCCDB8687763B88">thereon, wi&s;hing to leave our readers the &s;ole power of judging for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the detail of the&s;e impor|tant events, we have given an ac|count of the cu&s;toms and manners of the original inhabitants of North America, and &s;uch as they nearly are at this day. We have al&s;o &s;hewn at what time, and by what cau&s;es, the Briti&s;h colonies in North America were fir&s;t &s;ettled, and have marked their ri&s;e from their original in&s;ignificance, till they be|came <HI>Thirteen United and Independent States.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to de&s;cribe what America is at pre&s;ent, or by what means &s;he became independent of the mo|ther country, it cannot be di&s;agreeable to our readers, to be informed of the per&s;ons, cu&s;toms, and manners, of the original in|habitants of North America.</P>
<P>The native American indians are tall and &s;trait in their limbs beyond the pro|portion of mo&s;t nations. Their bodies are &s;trong, but more fitted to endure much hard&s;hip, than to continue long at any &s;er|vile work, which they cannot &s;upport. Their bodies and heads are flatti&s;h;
<PB N="14" REF="025347_0012_0FCCFEECAECDF2E8" MS="y">their features are even and regular, but their countenances fierce; their hair long, black, lank, and very &s;trong, but without beards. The colour of their &s;kin is a red|i&s;h brown, which mo&s;t of them admire, and take proper methods to improve.</P>
<P>The Europeans, on their fir&s;t arrival in America, found the Indians quite naked, except tho&s;e parts, which it is common for the mo&s;t uncivili&s;ed people to conceal. Since that time, they have generally a coar&s;e blanket to cover them, which they buy from their neighbours. The whole tenor of their lives is of a piece: they are hardy, poor, and &s;qualid; and their edu|cation, from their infancy, is &s;olely direct|ed to fit their bodies for the mode of life they pur&s;ue, and to form their minds to inflict and endure the greate&s;t evils. Their only occupations are hunting and war, for agriculture is left to their women.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as their hunting &s;ea&s;on is over, which they go through with much patience and in which they exert great ingenuity, they pa&s;s the re&s;t of their lives in entire indolence. They &s;leep half the day in their huts, and ob&s;erve no bounds of de|cency in their eating and drinking. Be|fore the Europeans di&s;covered them, they had no &s;pirituous liquors; but now, the
<PB N="15" REF="025347_0013_0FCCFEF0623CF038">acquirement of the&s;e is the principal ob|ject of their pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The indians are grave, even to &s;adne&s;s, in their deportment upon any &s;erious occa|&s;ion, ob&s;ervant of tho&s;e in company, re|&s;pectful to the old, and of a temper cool and deliberate. They are never in ha&s;te to &s;peak before they have thought well of the matter, and are &s;ure the per&s;on, who &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke before them, has fini&s;hed all he has to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. They have, therefore, the greate&s;t contempt for the vivacity of the Euro|peans, who interrupt each other, and fre|quently &s;peak all together. In their pub|lic councils and a&s;&s;emblies, every man &s;peaks in his turn, according as his years, his wi&s;dom, or his &s;ervices to his country, have ranked him. Not a word, not a whi&s;per, not a murmur is heard from the re&s;t while he &s;peaks; no indecent condem|nation, no ill-timed applau&s;e. The younger cla&s;s attend for their in&s;truction, and here they learn the hi&s;tory of their nation; here they are inflamed with the &s;ongs of tho&s;e who celebrate the warlike actions of their ance&s;|tors; and here they are taught what are the intere&s;ts of their country, and how to pur|&s;ue them.</P>
<P>Though the American Indian is nat|urally humane and ho&s;pitable, yet, to the enemies of his country, or to tho&s;e who
<PB N="16" REF="025347_0014_0FCCFEF36D9F5628">have privately offended him, he is impla|capable. He conceals his re&s;entments, he appears reconciled, till, by &s;ome treachery or &s;urpri&s;e, he has an opportunity of exe|cuting an horrible revenge. No length of time is &s;ufficient to allay his re&s;entment, no di&s;tance of place great enough to pro|tect the object; he cro&s;&s;es the &s;teepe&s;t mountains, he pierces the mo&s;t impervious fore&s;ts, and traver&s;es the mo&s;t hideous bogs and de&s;erts for &s;ome hundreds of miles, bearing the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons, the fatigue of the expedition, the extremes of hunger and thir&s;t, with patience and cheerfulne&s;s, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing his enemy, on whom he exerci&s;es the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities.</P>
<P>The Americans have &s;carce any tem|ples; for, as they live by hunting, inhabit mean cottages, and are given to change their habitation, they are &s;eldom very reli|gious. Some appear to have little ideas of God; others entertain better notions, and hold the exi&s;tence of the Supreme Being, eternal and uncorruptible, who has power over all. Satisfied with owning this, which is traditionary among them, they pay him no &s;ort of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The darling pa&s;&s;ion of the Americans is liberty, and that in its fulle&s;t extent: to liberty the native Indians &s;acrifice every
<PB N="17" REF="025347_0015_0FCCFEF44BAE2878">thing. This is what makes a life of un|certainty and want &s;upportable to them, and their education is directed in &s;uch a manner as to cheri&s;h this di&s;po&s;ition to the utmo&s;t. They are indulged in all manner of liberty; they are never, upon any ac|count, cha&s;ti&s;ed with blows, and very rarely even chidden.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome tribes are found in Amer|ica with a king at their head, yet his power is rather per&s;ua&s;ive than coercive, and he is reverenced as a father, more than feared as a monarch. He has no guards, no pri&s;ons, no officers of ju&s;tice. In &s;ome tribes, there are a kind of nobility, who, when they come to years of di&s;cretion, are entitled to a place and vote in the councils of the nation. But among the Five Na|tions, or Iroquois, the mo&s;t celebrated commonwealth of North America, and in &s;ome other nations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here is no other qual|ification ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the head|men, but age, with ability and experience in their affairs.</P>
<P>Whenever any affair of con&s;equence is to be tran&s;acted, they appoint a fea&s;t, of which almo&s;t the whole nation partakes. There are &s;maller fea&s;ts on matters of le&s;s general concern, to which none are invited but tho&s;e who are engaged in that particular bu&s;ine&s;s. At the&s;e fea&s;ts it is again&s;t all
<PB N="18" REF="025347_0016_0FCCFEF79A708A18">rule to leave any thing; &s;o that, if they cannot eat all, what remains is thrown into the fire. They look upon fire as a thing &s;acred, and in all probability their fea&s;ts were anciently &s;acrifices. Before the entertainment is ready, the principal per&s;on begins a &s;ong, the &s;ubject of which is the fabulous or real hi&s;tory of their na|tion, the remarkable events which have happened, and whatever matters may con|duce to their honor or in&s;truction. The others &s;ing in their turn, they have dances too, with which they accompany their &s;ongs, chiefly of a martial kind; and no &s;olemnity or public bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on without &s;uch &s;ongs and dances.</P>
<P>The charge of the internal peace and or|der is likewi&s;e committed to the &s;ame council of the elders, which regulates whatever regards the external policy of the &s;tate. Their &s;uits are few, and quickly decided, having neither property nor art enough to render them perplexed or te|dious.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of any of their people, whe|ther by war or a natural dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, is lament|ed by the whole town he belongs to. In &s;uch circum&s;tances no bu&s;ine&s;s is taken in hand, however important, nor any rejoic|ings permited, however intere&s;ting the occa|&s;ion, until all the pious ceremonies due to
<PB N="19" REF="025347_0017_0FCCFEF9D5C234A8">the dead are performed, which are always di&s;charged with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity. The dead body is wa&s;hed, anointed, and painted, &s;o as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to abate the horrors of death. Then the women la|ment the lo&s;s with the mo&s;t bitter cries, and the mo&s;t hideous howlings, intermixed with &s;ongs, which celebrate the great ac|tions of the decea&s;ed, and tho&s;e of his an|ce&s;tors. The men mourn in a le&s;s ex|travagant manner. The whole village at|tends the body to the grave, which is then interred, habited in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous ornaments. With the body of the decea&s;|ed are placed his bow and arrows, with what he valued mo&s;t in his life, and pro|vi&s;ions for the long journey he is to take. Fea&s;ting attends this, as it does every &s;o|lemnity.</P>
<P>No in&s;tances of regard to their decea&s;ed friends are &s;o &s;triking as what they call the Fea&s;t of the Dead, or the Fea&s;t of Souls. The day of this ceremony is appointed in the council of their chiefs, who give or|ders for every thing that may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnificence. The neighbouring people are invited to par|take of the fea&s;t, and to be witne&s;&s;es of the &s;olemnity. At this time, all who have died &s;ince the la&s;t &s;olemn fea&s;t of that kind, are taken out of their graves; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who
<PB N="20" REF="025347_0018_0FCCFEFBFACE69B0">have been intered at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the villages are diligently &s;ought after, and brought to this great rendezvous of &s;epulchral relicts.</P>
<P>The opening of the&s;e tombs di&s;plays one of the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;cenes that can be con|ceived. &mdash; This humiliating portrait of hu|man mi&s;ery, exhibited in &s;o many images of death, wherein a thou&s;and various &s;hapes of horror are depicted, according to the dif|ferent ravages that time has made; forms altogether a &s;cene too indelicate to be here de&s;cribed. I know not which ought to affect us mo&s;t, the horror of &s;o &s;triking a &s;ight, or the tender piety and affection of tho&s;e poor people towards their departed friends.</P>
<P>This &s;trange fe&s;tival is the mo&s;t magnifi|cent and &s;olemn of any they have, not only on account of the great concour&s;e of natives and &s;trangers, and of the pompous re-interment they give to the dead, whom they dre&s;s in the fine&s;t &s;kins they can get, after having expo&s;ed them &s;ome time in this pomp, but for the games of all kinds which they celebrate upon the occa&s;ion, in the &s;pirit of tho&s;e, which the ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated upon &s;imi|lar occa&s;ions. In this manner do they en|deavor to &s;ooth the calamities of this life, by the honors they pay to the dead. Though
<PB N="21" REF="025347_0019_0FCCFEFD5C893CA0" MS="y">among the&s;e &s;avage nations this cu&s;tom is impre&s;&s;ed with &s;trong marks of the ferocity of their nature; yet an honour to the dead, a tender feeling of their ab&s;ence, and a revival of their memory, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent means of &s;oftening our rugged nature into humanity.</P>
<P>Though the women in America have generally the laborious part of oecon|omy upon them&s;elves, yet they are far from being the &s;laves they appear, and are not at all &s;ubject to the great &s;ubordina|tion, in which they are placed in countries where they &s;eem to be more re&s;pected. On the contrary, they hold their councils, and have their &s;hare in all deliberations that concern the &s;tate; nor are they &s;ound in|ferior to the part they act. Polygamy is practi&s;ed by &s;ome nations, but it is not general. In mo&s;t places, they content them&s;elves with one wife; but a divorce is admitted, and for the &s;ame cau&s;es that it was allowed among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans. No nation of the Americans is without a regular marriage, in which there are many ceremonies. Incontinent before marriage, after wedlock the cha&s;tity of their women is remarkable. The puni&s;h|ment of the adultre&s;s, as well as that of the adulterer, is in the hands of the hu&s;|band him&s;elf, and it is often &s;evere, being
<PB N="22" REF="025347_0020_0FCCFF01F4713778" MS="y">inflicted by him who is at once the party and the judge. Their marriages are not fruitful, &s;eldom producing above two or three children; and from hence we may derive the principal cau&s;e of the depopula|tion of America.</P>
<P>The manner of their preparing for war, and their mode of carrying it on, &s;eem pe|culiar to them&s;elves. Almo&s;t the &s;ole oc|cupation of the American Indian is war, or &s;uch an exerci&s;e as qualifies him for it. His whole glory con&s;i&s;ts in this, and no man is at all con&s;idered until he has en|crea&s;ed the &s;trength of his country with a captive, or adorned his hat with the &s;calp of one of his enemies. When the an|cients re&s;olve upon war, they do not al|ways declare what nation it is they are de|termined to attack, that the enemy, upon whom they really intend to fall, may be off their guard; and they &s;ometimes even let whole years pa&s;s over without committing any act of ho&s;tility, that the vigilance of all may be unben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the long continuance of the watch, and the uncertainty of the danger.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they are not idle at home. The principal captain &s;ummon&s;es the youths of the town to which he be|longs, the war-kettle is &s;et on the fire, the war &s;ongs and dances commence, the

<P>The fury of the nation being thus rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t height, and all longing to em|brue their hands in blood, the war captain prepares the fea&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts of dog's fle&s;h.

None are forced to the war; but, when they have accepted this billet, they are looked upon as enli&s;ted, and it is then death to recede. All the warriors in this a&s;&s;em|bly have their faces blackened with char|coal, intermixed with da&s;hes and &s;treaks of vermillion, which give them a mo&s;t horrid appearance.

<P>In this a&s;&s;embly, which is preparatory to their military expedition, the chief be|gins the war &s;ong, which having contin|ued for &s;ome time, he rai&s;es his voice to

"I invoke thee (&s;ays he) to be favorable to my enterpri&s;e! I invoke thy care of me and my family!

All the war|riors join him in this prayer with &s;houts and acclamations. The captain renews his &s;ong, &s;trikes his club again&s;t the &s;takes of the cottage, and begins the war-dance, accompanied with the &s;houts of all his companions, which continue as long as he dances.</P>
<P>On the day appointed for their departure, they take leave of their friends, and change their clothes, or what moveables they have, in token of friend&s;hip. Their wives and female relations go out before them, and attend at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town. The warriors march out all dre&s;&s;ed in their fine&s;t apparel and mo&s;t &s;howy ornaments, regularly one after another, for they never march in rank.

<P>The Indians &s;eldom engage in a war upon motives common to Europe: they have no other end but the glory of victory, or the benefit of their &s;laves, which it ena|bles them to add to their nation, or &s;acri|fice to their brutal fury; and it is very &s;el|dom, that they take any pains to give their wars even the colour of ju&s;tice. They fall &s;ometimes on one nation, and &s;ometimes on another, and &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome of their hunters, whom they &s;calp and bring home as pri&s;oners. Their &s;enators wink at this, or rather encourage it, as it tends to keep up the martial &s;pirit of the people, enures them to watchfulne&s;s and hard&s;hips, and gives them an early ta&s;te for blood. The qualities of an indian war are vigilance and attention, and to give and avoid a &s;ur|pri&s;e; and patience and &s;trength to endure the intolerable fatigues and hard&s;hips which always attend it.</P>
<P>They often enter a village, while the &s;trength of the nation is employed in hunt|ing, and ma&s;&s;acre all the helple&s;s old men, women and children, or make pri&s;oners of as many as they can manage, or have &s;trength enough to be u&s;eful to their na|tion. They often cut off &s;mall parties of
<PB N="26" REF="025347_0024_0FCCFF094C30F0F0" MS="y">men in their huntings; but when they di&s;|cover an army of their enemies, their way is to throw them&s;elves flat on their faces among the withered leaves, the colour of which their bodies are painted exactly to re|&s;emble. They generally let a part pa&s;s unmole&s;ted, and then, ri&s;ing a little, they take aim, being excellent mark&s;men, and &s;etting up a tremendous &s;hout, which they call the war-cry, they pour a &s;tream of mu&s;|ket bullets on the enemy, having long &s;ince laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of arrows. The party at|tacked returns the &s;ame cry.

<P>Having fought &s;ometime in this man|ner, the party which thinks it has the ad|vantage ru&s;hes out of its cover, with &s;mall axes in their hands, which they dart with great addre&s;s and dexter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.

<P>The conquerors enter the town in tri|umph; the war captain waits upon the head men, and in a low voice gives them a circum&s;tantial account of every particu|lar of the expedition, of the damages the enemy have &s;uffered, and his own lo&s;s in it. This being done the public orator relates the whole to the people. Before they yield to the joy which the victory occa&s;ions, they lament the friends they have lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit of it. The parties mo&s;t nearly concerned are apparently afflicted with a deep and real &s;orrow; but, by one of tho&s;e &s;trange turns of the human mind, fa&s;hion|ed to any thing by cu&s;tom, as if they were di&s;ciplined in their grief, upon the &s;ignal for rejoicing, in a moment the tears are wiped from their eyes, and they ru&s;h into an

<P>It is u&s;ual to offer a &s;lave to each hou&s;e that has lo&s;t a friend, giving the preference according to the greatne&s;s of the lo&s;s. The per&s;on who has taken the captive at|tends him to the door of the party's cot|tage, where he delivers him, and with him gives a belt of wampum, to &s;hew that he has fulfilled the purpo&s;e of the expedition, in &s;upplying the lo&s;s of a citizen.

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the mo&s;t zealous and eminent prote&s;tants, in the reign of Edward VI. oppo&s;ed the popi&s;h ceremo|nies and habits though otherwi&s;e united to their brethren in religious tenets. Hun|dreds of them fled into foreign parts to avoid per&s;ecutions, where they connected them&s;elves with prote&s;tants of other na|tions, who were equally arduous for a ref|ormation.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, the refugees returned to Eng|land, loaded with experience and learning, but in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and poverty. Tho&s;e of the clergy who could comply with the Queen's e&s;tabli&s;hment, were quickly preferred; but the re&s;t, after be|ing permitted to preach a while, were &s;u&s;|pended, and reduced to their former indi|gence.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="025347_0031_0FCCFF1485BF11C0">
The clergy and laity, who wi&s;hed for greater eccle&s;ia&s;tical purity, &s;truggled hard for the aboli&s;hment of popi&s;h ce|remonies and habits, or at lea&s;t, leaving the u&s;e of them indifferent in divine &s;er|vice, by which, they obtained nothing but the honorable nick name of PURI|TANS. Queen Elizabeth had enough of the blood of Henry the Eighth, to make her impatient of any oppo&s;ition to her will, e&s;pecially in matters of religion, in which &s;he had an high opinion of her own know|ledge; and, during her whole reign, &s;he kept down the puritans with an uniform and inflexible &s;everity. The merits, however, of their &s;ufferings, the affected plainne&s;s of their dre&s;s, the gravity of their deportment, and the u&s;e of &s;cripture phra&s;es on the mo&s;t ordinary occa&s;ions, and even their names, which had in them &s;omething &s;triking and venerable, as being borrowed from the Old Te&s;tament, gained them a general e&s;|teem among &s;ober people of ordinary un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P>When King James came to the throne, he had a very fair opportunity of pacifying matters, or, at lea&s;t he might have left them in the condition he found them. On the contrary, he &s;uffered them to be per|&s;ecuted, but not de&s;troyed; they were ex|a&s;perated, and yet left powerful; and the

<P>In this &s;tate matters remained, until the acce&s;&s;ion of Charles the Fir&s;t, when they were far from being mended. This prince, andowed with &s;ome virtues, had very few amiable qualities. As grave as the puri|tans them&s;elves, he could never eagage the licentious part of the world in his fa|vour; and that gravity being turned again&s;t the puritans, made him more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous to them. He gave him&s;elf up entirely to the church and churchmen, and he fini&s;hed his ill-conduct, in this re&s;pect, by conferring the fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity of the king|dom, and a great &s;way in temporal affairs, upon Dr. Laud, who, hardly fit to direct a college, was entru&s;ted with the govern|ment of an empire.</P>
<P>The puritans con&s;idered the mo&s;t dreary realms, and the mo&s;t unfrequented regions, where they could enjoy liberty of con|&s;cience, as &s;uperior to the mo&s;t &s;plendid palaces, where they were to be governed by Laud.

<P>Two large &s;hips arrived at Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay, in 1637, with pa&s;&s;engers from Lon|don. Great pains were taken to prevail

They then laid the foun|dation of a flouri&s;hing colony, of which New Haven was the capital. Connecti|cut and New-Haven continued two di&s;tinct colonies for many years.

The fir&s;t emigration to this part of America con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred gentlemen of con&s;iderable fortune and rank, with their adherents, chiefly Roman Catholics, who hoped to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience un|der a proprietary of their own profe&s;&s;ion. They &s;ailed from England in November, and landed in Maryland the beginning of 1633. Gov. Calvert, brother to Lord Baltimore, very wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly purcha&s;ed, by pre&s;ents of various goods, the rights of the Indians, and with their free con&s;ent took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their town, which he called St. Mary's. The country was &s;et|tled with &s;o much ea&s;e, and furni&s;hed with &s;o many conveniencies, that emigrants re|paired thither in &s;uch numbers as &s;oon to
<PB N="41" REF="025347_0039_0FCCFF2286D62EE0" MS="y">render the colony populous and flouri&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>Carolina follows Maryland in the order of exi&s;tence. A few adventurers emi|grated from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and &s;ettled round Cape Fear, about the time of the Re&s;toration They con&s;idered mere oc|cupancy, with a transfer from the natives, without any grant from the king, as a good title upon the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. They deemed them&s;elves entitled to the &s;ame civil privileges as tho&s;e of the country from whence they had emigrated. For years they experienced the complicated mi&s;|eries of want. They &s;olicited the aid of their countrymen, and the general court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, with an attention and hu|manity which did it the greate&s;t honor, ordered an exten&s;ive contribution for their relief,</P>
<P>The final &s;ettlement of the province was effected equally through the rapacity of the courtiers of Charles the Second, and his own facility in rewarding tho&s;e, to whom he was greatly indebted, with a lib|erality that co&s;t him little. The pretence, which had been u&s;ed on former occa&s;ions, of a pious zeal for the propagation of the go&s;pel among the indians, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively employed to procure a grant of the im|men&s;e region, lying between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6th de|gree
<PB N="42" REF="025347_0040_0FCCFF2382D30D90">of North latitude, and the river of St. Matheo, under the thirty fir&s;t degree. In March, 1663, this territory was erected into a province by the name of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and conferred on Lord Clarendon, the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Craven, Lord Berkeley, Lord A&s;hley, Sir George Car|teret, Sir John Colleton, and Sir William Berkeley, as ab&s;olute lord proprietaries, for ever, &s;aving the allegiance due to the crown.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania and the Delaware counties next demand our attention. Mr. William Penn, one of the joint purcha&s;ers of the we&s;tern part of the Jer&s;eys, having re|ceived the mo&s;t exact information of the country to the we&s;tward of the Delaware, while engaged in the admini&s;tration of the joint purcha&s;e, became de&s;irous of acquir|ing a &s;eperate e&s;tate.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ented a petition to Charles the Second in June, 1680, &s;tating not only his relation&s;hip to the late admiral, but that he was deprived of a debt due from the crown, when the Exchequer was &s;hut. He prayed for a grant of lands, lying to the northward of Maryland, and we&s;tward of the Delaware; and added that by his intere&s;t, he &s;hould be able to &s;ettle a pro|vince, which might, in time, repay his claims. Having a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he
<PB N="43" REF="025347_0041_0FCCFF25383436D0">copied from the charter of Maryland the &s;ketch of a patent, which in November was laid before the attorney general for his opinion.</P>
<P>Penn had the &s;ame object in view as Lord Baltimore had, the guarding again&s;t the exertions of prerogative, which expe|rience had taught both were very incon|venient. The attorney general declared the clau&s;e of exemption from taxation il|legal; and chief ju&s;tice North being of the &s;ame opinion, and ob&s;erving its tend|ency, added the &s;aving of the authority of the Engli&s;h parliament; &s;o that it was &s;tipulated by the king, for him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, that "no cu&s;tom or other con|tribution &s;hall be laid on the inhabitants or their e&s;tates, unle&s;s by the con&s;ent of the proprietary, or governor and a&s;&s;embly, or by act of parliament in England."</P>
<P>The next year, 1681, the patent was granted, in con&s;ideration of "the merits of the father, and the good purpo&s;es of the &s;on, in order to extend the Engli&s;h empire, and to promote u&s;eful commo|dities." It was provided by fit clau&s;es, that the &s;overeignty of the king &s;hould be pre|&s;erved, and that acts of parliament, con|cerning trade, navigation, and the cu&s;toms, be duly ob&s;erved. Penn was empowered to a&s;&s;emble the freemen, or their delegates,
<PB N="44" REF="025347_0042_0FCCFF2840D60CE0">in &s;uch form as he &s;hall think proper for rai&s;ing money for the u&s;e of the colony, and for making u&s;eful laws, not contrary to tho&s;e of England, or the rights of the kingdom. A duplicate of the acts of the a&s;&s;embly was to be tran&s;mitted, within five years, to the king in council, and the acts might be de|clared void within &s;ix months if not approved &mdash;It now remains only to give a conci&s;e account of the &s;ettlement of Georgia.</P>
<P>In 1732, a number of gentlemen con|&s;idering the va&s;t benefit that might ari&s;e from the tract of land, lying between the Savannah and the river Alatamaha, peti|tioned the king for a charter, which was accordingly granted in June. They meant that the country &s;hould be made a bulwark for the &s;outhern colonies again&s;t the Span|iards, and &s;hould give employment to num|bers of people, who were burthen&s;ome at home to their friends and pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Towards the end of Augu&s;t, Sir Gil|bert Heathcote recommended, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to the directors of the Bank, the intere&s;t of the colony. His &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect, and the mem|bers of the court, after his example, con|tributed largely towards the undertaking, as did great numbers of the nobility, gen|try, clergy and others; and the parliament granted 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> By the beginning of
<PB N="45" REF="025347_0043_0FCCFF2B37E46D08" MS="y">November, about one hundred and &s;ixteen coloni&s;ts pre&s;ented them&s;elves, mo&s;t of them labouring people, and were furni&s;hed with working tools of all kinds, &s;tores, and &s;mall arms.</P>
<P>Mr. Oglethorpe, one of the tru&s;tees, generou&s;ly attended the fir&s;t &s;et of emi|grants to Carolina, where they arrived in good health in, January 1733. The Ca|rolinians made them a pre&s;ent of one hundred breeding cattle, be&s;ides hogs, and twenty barrels of rice, and furni&s;hed them with a party of hor&s;e, and with &s;cout boats, by the help of which they reached the Savannah, where Mr. Oglethorpe, ten miles up the river, pitched upon a &s;pot for a town, and in February the building of the fir&s;t hou&s;e commenced.</P>
<P>Mr. Oglethorpe was waited upon by a numerous deputation from the lower Creek nation, with whom he concluded a treaty, and &s;oon after &s;et out for Charles-town on his return to England, bringing with him &s;everal chiefs and a war captain. Before the end of March, 1734, more emigrants, to the amount of &s;ix hundred, were either &s;ent over by charity, or went at their own expence.</P>
<P>In October, the Indians embarked for their own country, having had an allow|ance, while in London, of twenty pounds
<PB N="46" REF="025347_0044_0FCCFF2C867361E8">a week, of which they &s;pent little, as they commonly eat-and drank at the table of per&s;ons of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction. They embarked at Grave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end, in a &s;hip which carried over a number of Salez burghers, being German prote&s;tants, who, with others of their countrymen that followed, &s;ettled on the Savannah, a town they called Ebe|nezer, and which, by their habits of in|du&s;try and &s;obriety &s;oon became con&s;ider|able.</P>
<P>The Georgians made a &s;urpri&s;ing pro|gre&s;s in clearing their lands, and building their hou&s;es, and as an encouragement, the Briti&s;h parliament granted them a &s;up|ply of 26,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which, with very great private donations. were expended upon &s;trengthening the &s;outhern part of Georgia.</P>
<P>Thus have we given a &s;uccinct account of the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h colonies in North America. By what unhappy means they at la&s;t became &s;epe|rated from the mother country. will be clearly &s;hown in the &s;ub&s;equent part of this hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE narrow limits pre&s;cribed to us in this epitome, will not permit us to enter into a copious detail of all the mi|nute concerns of the colonies, which may be found in more voluminous works, and there read by tho&s;e, who have lei&s;ure and inclination to pur&s;ue &s;o dry a &s;tudy. We &s;hall therefore proceed to de&s;cribe only events of &s;ome con&s;equence.</P>
<P>News being received in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts of war being declared again&s;t France and Spain, the general court, then &s;itting, made immediate provi&s;ion for rai&s;ing forces for Anapolis in Nova Scotia.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="025347_0046_0FCCFF32C04B1A90">
Towards the end of the month of April, 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Commodore Warren arrived from the We&s;t Indies, with a &s;ixty gun &s;hip, and two of forty. He was &s;oon after joined by another of forty, which had reached Can&s;o a &s;hort time before. The men of war failed immediately to crui&s;e before Loui&s;bourg. The forces &s;oon fol|lowed, and landed at Chapeaurouge Bay the la&s;t day of April. The tran&s;ports were di&s;covered from the town early in the morning, which gave the inhabitants the fir&s;t knowledge of the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day after landing, four hund|red men marched round, behind the hills, to the northea&s;t harbour, where they got about midnight, and &s;et fire to all the dwellings and &s;torehou&s;es, till they came within a mile of the grand battery. The clouds of thick &s;moke proceeding from the pitch, tar, and other combu&s;tibles, prevented the garri&s;on's di&s;covering the enemy, though they were but at a &s;hort di&s;tance.</P>
<P>They expected the body of the army upon them, and therefore de&s;erted the fort, having thrown their powder into a well; but the cannon and &s;hot were left, which proved of great &s;ervice to the be&s;iegers. The army had near two miles to tran&s;port their cannon, mortars, &amp;c. through a mo|ra&s;s,
<PB N="49" REF="025347_0047_0FCCFF3452A5DD60">which required great labour to accom|pli&s;h. The men were yoked together, and during the night made great advances.</P>
<P>While the forces were bu&s;ily employed on &s;hore, the men of war, and other ve&s;&s;els were crui&s;ing off the habour, as often as the weather would permit. On the 18th of May, they captured a french 44 gun &s;hip, having 560 men on board, and &s;tores of all forts for the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>It was given out, that an attack would be made by &s;ea with the &s;hips, on the 18th, while the army did the like by land. Whe|ther a general &s;torm was really intended or not, the French appeared to expect it, from the preparations making on board the men of war, and &s;eemed not inclined to attempt to with&s;tand it.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth, a flag of truce was &s;ent to the general, de&s;iring a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;|tilities, that they might con&s;ider of articles for a capitulation. Time was allowed, but their articles were rejected by the general and commodore, and others offered, which were accepted by the French, and ho&s;tages given on both &s;ides. The town was in con|&s;equence delivered up on the &s;eventeenth. As this was a time when ve&s;&s;els were ex|pected from all parts at Loui&s;bourg, the French flag was kept flying as a decoy. Two Ea&s;t Indiamen, and one South-&s;ea &s;hip, of the value of 600,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, were taken
<PB N="50" REF="025347_0048_0FCCFF35890DB020">by the &s;quadron, at the mouth of the har|bour, into which they failed as u&s;ual, not knowing that the place had been taken by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The French having been very trouble&s;ome in the back &s;ettlements of our colonies, it was concluded to take effectual methods to drive them from the Ohio. The reduction of Niagara, Crown Point, and their forts in Nova Scotia, was al&s;o re&s;olved on. General Braddock was accordingly &s;ent from Ireland to Virginia, with two regiments of foot; and on his arrival, when joined by the re&s;t of the forces de&s;tined for that &s;ervice, he found him&s;elf at the head of 2200 men. He had bravery, but wanted other qualifications to render him fit for the &s;ervice to which he was appointed. The &s;everity or his di&s;cipline made him unpopular among the regulars, and his haughtine&s;s deprived him of the e&s;teem of the Americans. His pride di&s;gu&s;ted the indians, and led him to de&s;pi&s;e the country militia, and to &s;light the advice of the Virginian officers.</P>
<P>Colonel Wa&s;hington earne&s;tly begged of him, when the army was marching for fort Du Que&s;ne, to admit of his going before, and &s;couring the woods with his rangers, which was contemptuou&s;ly refu&s;ed. The general had been cautioned by the Duke of Cumberland to guard again&s;t a &s;urpri&s;e, and yet he pu&s;hed on heedle&s;sly with the fir&s;t di|vi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of 1400 men, till he fell
<PB N="51" REF="025347_0049_0FCCFF37012A3F90">into an ambu&s;cade of 400, chiefly indians, by whom he was defeated and mortally wounded, on the 9th of July, 1755.</P>
<P>The regulars were put into the greate&s;t panic, and fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; but the militia had been u&s;ed to indian fighting, and were not &s;o terrified. The general had di&s;dainfully turned them into the rear, where they continued in a body unbroken, and &s;erved under Colonel Wa&s;hington as a mo&s;t u&s;eful rear guard, which covered the retreat of the regulars, and prevented their being entirely cut to pieces.</P>
<P>Previous to this and agreeable to the views of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly rai&s;ed a body of troops, which were &s;ent to Nova Scotia, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Lieutenant Go|vernor Lawrence in driving the French from their &s;everal encroachments within that pro|vince.</P>
<P>The expedition again&s;t Niagara was en|tru&s;ted to Governor Shirley, but failed thro' various cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir William, then Colonel, John&s;on, was appointed to go again&s;t Crown Point. The delays, &s;lowne&s;s, and deficiency of prepara|tion, prevented the &s;everal colonies joining their troops till about Augu&s;t. In the mean time the active enemy had tran&s;ported forces from France to Canada, marched them down to meet the provincials, and attacked them; but, meeting with a repul&s;e, lo&s;t &s;ix hundred
<PB N="52" REF="025347_0050_0FCCFF38A4A7D9A0">men, be&s;ides having their general Baron Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;kau wounded and made pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The next year, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts rai&s;ed a great armament to go again&s;t Crown Point; but Lord London, on his arrival, did not think it proper that the forces &s;hould proceed, owing to a temporary mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween his Lord&s;hip and the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>In the year 1758, happily for the Briti&s;h nation, the great Mr. Pitt was placed at the head of the mini&s;try, when the face of affairs was &s;oon changed, the war was pro&s;ecuted with unexampled &s;ucce&s;s, and the enemy was at length driven out of America.</P>
<P>Mr. I&s;rael Mauduit, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a|gent, in 1763, gave early notice of the mini&s;|terial intentions to tax the colonies; but the general court not being called together till the latter end of the year, in&s;tructions to the agent, though &s;olicited by him, could not be &s;ent in proper time.</P>
<P>The next year however, 1764, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives came to the following re|&s;olutions: "That the &s;ole right of giving and granting the money of the people of that province, was ve&s;ted in them as their legal repre&s;entatives; and that the impo&s;ition of duties and taxes by the parliament of Great Britain, upon a people who are not repre|&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is ab&s;o|lutely irreconcileable with their rights."&mdash;"That no man can ju&s;tly take the property
<PB N="53" REF="025347_0051_0FCCFF3C684900E8">of another without his con&s;ent; upon which original principle, the right of repre&s;entation in the &s;ame body, which exerci&s;es the power of making laws for levying taxes, one of the main pillars of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, is evidently founded."</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;olutions were occa&s;ioned by in|telligence of what had been done in the Bri|ti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons. It had been there debated in March, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther they had a <HI>right</HI> to tax the Americans, they not being repre|&s;ented; and determined unanimou&s;ly in the affirmative. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;ingle per&s;on pre&s;ent ven|tured to controvert the <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>After various propo&s;itions for taxing the colonies, Mr. Grenville's intended &s;tamp act was communicated to the American agents. Many of them did not oppo&s;e it, half their number being placemen or depo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> on the mini&s;try. Mr. Jo&s;eph Sherwood, an hone&s;t quaker, agent for Rhode I&s;land, refu&s;ed his con&s;ent to America's being taxed by a Bri|ti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment. Mr. Mauduit, the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts agent, favoured the rai&s;ing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> money by a &s;tamp duty, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would occa&s;ion le&s;s expence of officers, and would include the We&s;undia i&s;lands. The &s;cheme, however was po&s;tponed, and the ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ts au|thori&s;ed to inform the American a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">blies, that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t liberty to &s;ugge&s;t any other ways of rai&s;ing monies, and that Mr. Gren|ville, was ready to receive propo&s;als for any
<PB N="54" REF="025347_0052_0FCCFF3DC59DBE80">other tax, that might be equivalent in its produce to the &s;tamp tax. The colonies &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as an affront, rather than as a compliment. The mini&s;ter would not be content with any thing &s;hort of a cer|tain &s;pecific &s;um, and proper funds for the payment of it. Had not the &s;ums been an|&s;werable to his wi&s;hes, he would have reject|ed them; and he would &s;carcely have been &s;atisfied with le&s;s than 300,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, which was judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to de|fray the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e expence of the army propo&s;ed for the defence of America.</P>
<P>No &s;atisfactory propo&s;als being made on the &s;ide of the Americans, Mr. Grenville adhered to his purpo&s;e of bringing forward the &s;tamp bill, though repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of his friends to de&s;i&s;t. Richard Jack|&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had been cho&s;en agent for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who, with Mr. Franklin and other, lately come from Philadelphia, waited on Mr. Grenville, in February 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to re|mon&s;trate again&s;t the &s;tamp bill and to pro|po&s;e, that in ca&s;e any tax mu&s;t be laid upon America, the &s;everal colonies might be per|mited to lay the tax them&s;elves. Mr. Gren|ville, however, adhered to his own opinions, and &s;aid that he had pledged his word for of|fering the &s;tamp bill to the hou&s;e, and that the hou&s;e would hear their objections.</P>
<P>The bill was accordingly brought in, and in March, the &s;ame year, received the royal
<PB N="55" REF="025347_0053_0FCCFF4074FD4EC0" MS="y">a&s;&s;ent. The framers of the &s;tamp-act flat|tered them&s;elves, that the confu&s;ion which would ari&s;e from the di&s;u&s;e of writings, would compel the colonies to u&s;e &s;tamp paper, and therefore to pay the taxes impo&s;ed. Thus they were led to pronounce it to be a law which would execute it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Grenville, however, was not without his apprehen&s;ions that it might occa&s;ion di&s;|order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to prevent or &s;uppre&s;s which he pro|jected another bill, which was brought in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ions, whereby it was made lawful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> military officers in the colonies to quarter their &s;oldiers in private hou&s;es. This &s;eemed intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other act. Great oppo&s;ition being made to it, as under &s;uch a power in the army, no one could look on his hou&s;e as his own, that part of the bill, was dropt; but there &s;till remained a clau&s;e when it pa&s;&s;ed into a law, to oblige the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies to provide quarters for the &s;oldiers, and to furni&s;h them with firing, bedding, candles, &s;mall beer, rum, and &s;undry other articles, at the expence of the &s;everal provinces. This clau&s;e continu|ed in force after the &s;tamp act was re|pealed.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings of the mother country gave ri&s;e to great di&s;turbances in America. Some per&s;ons of con&s;equence at Bo&s;ton, to manife&s;t their abhorrence and dete&s;tation of a party in England, who they &s;uppo&s;ed were
<PB N="56" REF="025347_0054_0FCCFF41A208A580">endeavoring to &s;ubvert the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion, to en&s;lave the colonies, and to alienate the affections of his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects in America, early in the morning of the 14th of Augu&s;t, hung upon the limb of a large dead elm, near the entrance of Bo&s;ton, in one of the mo&s;t public &s;treets, two e&s;&s;igies. One of them, as appeared by the labels af|fixed thereto, was intended to repre&s;ent the &s;tamp officer; the other was a jack-boot, with a head and horns peeping out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">p.</P>
<P>The report of this novelty drew great numbers from every part of the town and the neighboring country. This affair was left to take its own cour&s;e, &s;o that an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit diffu&s;ed it&s;elf into the minds of the &s;pectators. In the evening, the figures were cut down, and carried in funeral proce&s;&s;ion, the populace &s;houting, <HI>Liberty and property forever! No &s;tamps, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They then went to a new building, erected by Mr. Oliver, which they pulled down, fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ing it to be de&s;igned for the &s;tamp-office. As &s;oon as they approached Mr. Oliver's hou&s;e, they beheaded the e&s;&s;igy, at the &s;ame time breaking all his windows, and demoli&s;hed his gardens, fences, barns, and every thing el&s;e that came in their way.</P>
<P>The next day, Mr. Oliver, fearful of what might happen, declared that he had written to England and re&s;igned. The mob a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="57" REF="025347_0055_0FCCFF4413EFE1C0">again at night; and after &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions of joy for the re&s;ignation, proceeded to the lieutenant governor's, Mr. Hutchin&s;on's hou&s;e, which they be&s;ieged for an hour, but in vain; in&s;i&s;ting repeatedly upon knowing, whether he had not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n favor of the &s;tamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">act.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;orders grew ever day more enor|mous and alarming.

Crafty men may intermix with them, when they are much heated, and direct their operations very differently from what was at fir&s;t de&s;igned.</P>
<P>People in England were differently affected by the di&s;turbances in the colonies. Some were for &s;upporting the authority of parlia|ment at all events, and for enforcing the &s;tamp act, if needful, with the point of the &s;word; while others were for quieting the colonies by the repeal of it. Happily for them, Mr. Grenville and his party were thrown out of place, and were &s;ucceeded by the Marquis of Rockingham, when, on the 22d of February, 1766, this obnoxious act was repealed.</P>
<P>In May, 1767, Mr. Charles Town&s;end, then chancellor of the Exchequer, moved the Hou&s;e of Commons for leave to bring in bills for granting a duty upon paper, gla&s;s, painters colours, &amp;c. in the Briti&s;h American colo|nies;
<PB N="58" REF="025347_0056_0FCCFF46486DCE70" MS="y">for &s;ettling &s;alaries on the governors, judges, &amp;c. in North America; and for tak|ing off the duties on teas exported to Amer|ica, and granting a duty of three pence a pound on the importation in America. Two bills were at length framed, and in June and July received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e acts occa&s;ioned fre&s;h, di&s;turbances in America, where matters were carried to a much greater height than bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. In con|&s;equence of this, Lord Hill&s;borough wrote to General Gage, in June, 1768, to &s;end troops to Bo&s;ton, in order to pre&s;erve the peace of that town.</P>
<P>The introduction of troops into Bo&s;ton was attended with very &s;erious con&s;equences. The inhabitants became exceedingly riotous. and &s;ome of the rabble pu&s;hed their ill con|duct &s;o far, as to oblige the &s;oldiers to fire on them, in their own defence. This happened on the 5th of March, 1770, when three per|&s;ons were killed, five dangerou&s;ly wounded, and a few &s;lightly.</P>
<P>This was far from removing the evil, and only tended to widen the breach. Under the notion of zeal for liberty, the rabble ran into the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and were every where guilty of the mo&s;t lawle&s;s, un|ju&s;t, and tyrannical proceedings, pulling down hou&s;es, de&s;troying the property of every one that had fallen under their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;plea&s;ure,
<PB N="59" REF="025347_0057_0FCCFF47C0883330">and delivering pri&s;oners out of the hands of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to &s;ee what was doing, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mean time at home. The &s;upporting the authority of parliament, was the only cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned by the mini&s;ter him|&s;elf for retaining the tea duty at the very time when he acknowledged it to be as anti|commercial a tax, as any of tho&s;e that had been repealed upon that principle.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t India company, feeling the bad effects of the colonial &s;muggling trade in the large quantities of tea, which remained in their warehou&s;es un&s;old, reque&s;ted the repeal of the three-pence per pound in America, and offered, that on its being complied with, government &s;hould retain &s;ix-pence in the pound on the exportation. Thus the compa|ny pre&s;ented the happie&s;t opportunity that could have been offered for honorably remov|ing the cau&s;e of difference with America. This afforded an opening for doing ju&s;tice, without infringing the claims on either &s;ide. The mini&s;ter was reque&s;ted and intreated, by a gentleman of great weight in the com|pany, and a member of parliament, to em|brace the oportunity; but it was ob&s;tinately rejected.</P>
<P>New contrivances were &s;et on foot to intro|duce the tea, attended with the three penny d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, into all the colonies. Various intrigues and &s;olicitations were u&s;ed to induce the Ea&s;t-India
<PB N="60" REF="025347_0058_0FCCFF4B6BC206C0">company to undertake this ra&s;h and fooli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s. It was prote&s;ted again&s;t as contrary to the principle of the company's monopol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power of the mini&s;try prevailed, and the in&s;ignificant three-penny duty on tea was doomed to be the fatal bone of contention between Great Britain and her colonies. The company at la&s;t adopted the &s;y&s;tem, and became their own factors. They &s;ent 600 che&s;ts of tea to Philadelphia, the like quantity to New York and Bo&s;ton, be|&s;ides what was con&s;igned to other places. Several &s;hips were al&s;o freighted for different colonies, and agents appointed for the di&s;po&s;al of the commodity.</P>
<P>In the mean time the coloni&s;ts, who well knew what had pa&s;&s;ed in the mother country, were concerting mea&s;ures to counteract the views of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try Soon after the arrival of the tea &s;hips at Bo&s;ton, a num|ber of per&s;ons, chiefly ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, and &s;hip bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lders from the north end of the town, about &s;eventeen in number, dre&s;&s;ed as In|dians, went on board the &s;hips, and in about two hours hoi&s;ted out of them, and broke open 342 che&s;ts of tea the contents of which they emptied into the &s;ea.

<P>The&s;e and other deci&s;ive proceedings of the Bo&s;tonians, induced the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to bring in a bill into parliament, "for the immediate removal of the officers concerned in the collection of the cu&s;toms at Bo&s;ton, and to di&s;continue the landing and di&s;charg|ing, lading and &s;hipping of goods, wares, and merchandizes, at Bo&s;ton, or within the harbour thereof." On the 31&s;t of March, 1774, the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Other bills were pa&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h par|liament, brought in by Lord North, all tend|ing to puni&s;h the Americans, and the Bol|tonians in particular, for their refractory be|haviour. Petitions were &s;ent over from America, and &s;everal of the members of both hou&s;es reprobated the&s;e &s;evere and dangerous proceedings; but no regard was paid either to the petitions or to the remon&s;trances of the minority in both hou&s;es. The then min|i&s;try, at the head of which was Lord North, were determined to accept from the Ameri|cans of nothing &s;hort of ab&s;olute and impli|cit obedience to the laws of taxation. On the other hand, the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, &s;upported and &s;purred on by the other colo|nies, were determined not to &s;ubmit, and pre|pared to repel force by force. They col|lected

<P>The&s;e proceedings of the people, and their manife&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;i&s;tance, alarmed the general, who thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;afety of the troops, as well as to &s;ecure the important po&s;t of Bo&s;ton, to fortify the en|trance at the neck, which afforded the only communication, except by water, between the town and the continent.</P>
<P>In England, petitions were pre&s;ented from the merchants of London, and almo&s;t all the trading towns in the kingdom; and Mr. Bol|lan, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Lee, al&s;o pre|&s;ented petitions from the American congre&s;s; but government treated them with indifference and contempt.</P>
<P>Lord Chatham per&s;evered in the pro&s;ecu|tion of his conciliatory &s;cheme with Ame|rica, and accordingly brought into the hou&s;e of Lords the outlines of a bill, which he hoped would an&s;wer that &s;alutary purpo&s;e; but the mini&s;try rejected it. At the &s;ame time, Lord North gave a &s;ketch of the mea|&s;ures he intended to pur&s;ue, which were to &s;end a greater force to America, and to bring in a temporary act, to put a &s;top to all the foreign trade of the different colonies of New|England, particularly their fi&s;hery on the banks of Newfoundland, till they returned to their duty.</P>

While matters were thus going on at home, General Gage, at Bo&s;ton, received intelligence that cannon and carriages were depo&s;ited in the neighborhood of Salem. He accordingly &s;ent a body of troops from the ca&s;tle to &s;eize them, but the Americans found time to out them away, and the troops returned without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>A &s;kirmi&s;h having happened at Lexington, between the king's troops and a party of the militia, General Gage no &s;ooner received this intelligence than he detached Lord Piercy to Concord, with &s;ixteen companies of foot, and a number of marines, 900 men in the whole, and two pieces of cannon, to &s;upport Colonel Smith.</P>
<P>The junction of the Brigade under Lord Perey, with the detachment under Colonel Smith, gave the la&s;t a breathing time, e&s;pe|cially as they now had cannon, which awed the provincials from pre&s;&s;ing upon the rear in a direct line; but the whole force did not venture to halt long, as the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">te men and militia were every where collecting, in order to cut off their retreat to Bo&s;ton.

The regulars, when near Cambridge, were upon the point of taking a wrong road, which would have led them into the mo&s;t eminent danger; but were prevented by the direction of a young gentleman re&s;iding at the college.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring Ticonderoga was early attended to by many in New England. General Gage had &s;et the exam|ple of attempting to &s;eize upon military &s;tores, and by &s;o doing had commenced ho&s;tilities, &s;o that retaliation appeared warrantable.</P>
<P>Colonel Allen was at Ca&s;tleton, with about 270 men, 230 of which were <HI>Green Moun|tain Boys,</HI> &s;o called from their re&s;iding with|in the limits of the Green Mountains, the Hamp&s;hire Grants being &s;o denominated from the range of green mountains that run through them. Sentinels were placed im|mediately on all the roads to prevent any in|telligence being carried to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Colonel Arnold, who now joined Colonel Allen, reported, that there were at Ticon|deroga, 80 pieces of heavy cannon, 20 of bra&s;s, from four to eighteen pounders, ten or a dozen mortars, a number of &s;mall arms, and con&s;iderable &s;tores; that the fort was in a ruinous condition, and, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, garri&s;oned by about forty men. It was then &s;ettled, that Colonel Allen &s;hould have the &s;upreme command, and Colonel Arnold was to be his a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>Colonel Allen with his 230 Green Moun|tain Boys, arrived at Lake Champlain,
<PB N="67" REF="025347_0066_0FCCFF58B9FA7FB0">oppo&s;ite to Ticonderoga, on the ninth of May, at night. Boats were with difficulty procured, when he and Colonel Arnold cro&s;&s;ed over with 83 men, and landed near the garri&s;on The two colonels advanced along &s;ide each other, and entered the port, leading to the fort, in the grey of the morn|ing. A &s;entry &s;napped his fu&s;ee at Colonel Allen, and then retreated through the cov|ered way to the parade. The main body of Americans then followed, and drew up. Capt. de la Place, the commander, was &s;ur|pri&s;ed in bed. Thus was the place taken without any blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June, 1775, the congre&s;s proceeded to choo&s;e by ballot a general to command all the continental forces, and George Wa&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was unanimou&s;ly elected.</P>
<P>The next day, orders were i&s;&s;ued by the Americans, for a detachment of a thou&s;and men, to march at evening, and entrench upon Bunker's hill. By &s;ome mi&s;take, Breed's hill, high and large like the other, but &s;ituated on the furthe&s;t part of a penin&s;ula, next to Bo&s;|ton, was marked out for the intrenchment in|&s;tead of Bunker's. The provincials proceed|ed therefore to Breed's hill; but were prevent|ed going to work till near twelve o'clock at night, when they pur&s;ued their bu&s;ine&s;s with utmo&s;t diligence and alacrity; &s;o that by the dawn of the day, they had thrown up a
<PB N="68" REF="025347_0067_0FCCFF5CB74FA330">&s;mall redoubt, about eight rods &s;quare. Such was the extraordinary &s;ilence that reigned among them, that they were not heard by the Briti&s;h on board their ve&s;&s;els in the neigh|boring waters. The &s;ight of the works was the fir&s;t notice that the Lively man of war had of them, when the captain began firing upon them about four in the morning.</P>
<P>The guns called the town of Bo&s;ton, the camp, and the fleet, to behold a novelty, which was little expected. The pro&s;pect obliged the Briti&s;h generals to alter the plan they intended to have pur&s;ued the next day. They grew weary of being cooped up in Bo&s;ton, and had re&s;olved upon making them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of Dorche&s;ter heights; but the pre&s;ent provincial movement prevented the expedition. They were now called to at|tempt po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of Breed's hill, on which the provincials continued working, notwith&s;tanding a heavy fire from the ene|my's &s;hips, a number of &s;loating batteries, and a fortification up Cop's hill, in Bo&s;ton, directly oppo&s;ite to the little American re|doubt. An ince&s;&s;ant &s;hower of &s;hot and bombs was poured by the batteries upon the American works, and yet but one man was killed.</P>
<P>The Americans continuing laboring inde|fatigably till they had thrown up a &s;mall brea&s;t-work, extending from the ea&s;t &s;ide of the redoubt to the bottom of the hill; but
<PB N="69" REF="025347_0068_0FCCFF5EC5804F58">they were prevented completing it from the intolerable fire of the enemy. By &s;ome un|accountable error, the detachment, which had been working for hours, was neither re|lieved, nor &s;upplied with refre&s;hments, but were left to engage under the&s;e di&s;advan|tages.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one o'clock, and the day exceedingly hot, a number of boats and barges, filled with regular troops from Bo&s;ton approached Charle&s;town, when the men were landed at Moreton's Point. They con&s;i&s;ted of four battallions, two companies of grena|diers, and ten of light infantry, with a pro|portion of field artillery; but, by &s;ome over|&s;ight, their &s;pare cartridges were much too big for them: &s;o that, when the Americans were at length forced from their lines, there was not a round of artillery cartridges re|maining.</P>
<P>Major Gen. Howe and Brigadier Gen. Pigot had the command. The troops formed, and remained in that po&s;ition, till joined by a &s;econd detachment of light infantry and gre|nadier companies, a battalion of the land forces, and a batttalion of marines, amount|ing in the whole to about 3000 men. The Gererals Clinton and Burgoyne took their &s;tand upon Cops-hill, to ob&s;erve and contem|place the bloody and de&s;tructive operations that were now commencing. The regulars formed in two lines, and advanced delibe|rately,
<PB N="70" REF="025347_0069_0FCCFF60528155D0">frequently halting to give time for the artillery to fire, which was not well &s;erved. The light infantry were directed to force the left point of the brea&s;t-work, and to take the American line in flank. The grenadiers ad|vanced to attack in front, &s;upported by two battalions, while the left, under Gen. Pigot inclined to the right of the American line. One or two of the continental regiments had been po&s;ted in Charle&s;town, but afterwards removed to prevent their being cut off by a &s;udden attack; &s;o that the Briti&s;h were not in the lea&s;t hurt by the mu&s;quetry from thence,</P>
<P>Gen. Gage had for &s;ome time re&s;olved upon burning the town, whenever any works were rai&s;ed by the Americans upon the hills belonging to it: and while the Briti&s;h were advancing nearer to the attack, orders came to Cop's hill for executing the re&s;olution. Soon after a carca&s;s was di&s;charged, which &s;et fire to an old hou&s;e near the ferry way; the fire in&s;tantly &s;pread, and mo&s;t of the place was &s;oon in flames; while the hou&s;es at the ea&s;tern end of Charle&s;town were &s;et on fire by men who landed from the boats.</P>
<P>The regulars derived no advantage from the &s;moke of the conflagration, for the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifting, carried it another way, &s;o that it could not cover them in their ap|proach. The provincials had not a rifleman among them, not one being yet arrived from

However, they were almo&s;t all mark&s;men, being accu&s;tomed to &s;porting of one kind or other from their youth. A number of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts people were in the redoubt, and the part of the brea&s;t-work neare&s;t it. The left of the brea&s;t-work, and the open ground &s;tretching beyond its point to the water-&s;ide, through which there was not an opportunity of carry|ing the work, was occupied partly by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts forces, and partly by the peo|ple of Connecticut.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h moved on &s;lowly to the at|tack, in&s;tead of u&s;ing a quick &s;tep; which gave the provincials the advantage of taking &s;urer and cooler aim. The&s;e re&s;erved their fire, till the regulars came within ten or twelve rods, when they began a furious di&s;|charge of &s;mall arms, which &s;topped the re|gulars, who kept up the firing without ad|vancing. The di&s;charge from the Americans was &s;o ince&s;&s;ant, and did &s;uch execution, that the regulars retreated in di&s;order, and with great precepitation towards the place of landing. Their officers u&s;ed every effort to make them return to the charge, with which they at length complied; but the Americans again re&s;erved their fire till the regulars came within five or &s;ix rods, when the enemy was a &s;econd time put to flight.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="025347_0072_0FCCFF64BB15AFC8">
General Howe and the officers redoubled their exertions; and General Clinton, per|ceiving how the army was &s;taggered, pa&s;&s;ed over, without waiting for orders, and joined them in time to be of &s;ervice. The Ameri|cans being in want of powder, &s;ent for a &s;upply but could procure none; for there was but a barrel and a half in the magazine. This deficiency di&s;abled them from making the &s;ame defence as before; while the Bri|ti&s;h reaped a further advantage by bringing &s;ome cannon to bear, &s;o as to rake the in&s;ide of the brea&s;t work from end to end. The regular army now made a deci&s;ive pu&s;h, and the fire from the &s;hips and batteries was re|doubled. The provincials were of nece&s;&s;ity ordered to retreat.</P>
<P>It was feared by the Americans, that the Briti&s;h troops would pu&s;h the advantage they had gained, and march immediately to the head quarters at Cambridge, about two miles di&s;tant, and in no &s;tate of defence. But they advanced no farther than to Bunker's<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hill, where they threw up works for their own &s;ecurity. The provincials did the &s;ame upon Pro&s;pect-hill, in front of them, about half way to Cambridge.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h according to Ge|neral Gage, amounted to 1054, of whom 226 were killed; of the&s;e 19 were commi&s;&s;ioned officers, including a lieutenant colonel, two majors, and &s;even captains. Seventy other
<PB N="73" REF="025347_0073_0FCCFF67DB87E5B8">officers were wounded. Among tho&s;e more generally regretted, were Lieutenant Colonet Abercromby, and Major Pitcairn.</P>
<P>The provincials had 139 killed, 278 wounded, and 36 were mi&s;&s;ing, in all 453.</P>
<P>In the opinion of many, General Howe was chargeable with a capital error in land|ing and attacking as he did. It might ori|ginate from too great a confidence in the forces he commanded, and in too contemp|tuous an opinion of the enemy he had to en|counter. He certainly might have entrapped the provincials, by landing on the narrowe&s;t part of Charle&s;ton neck, under the fire of the floating batteries and &s;hips of war. Here he might have &s;tationed and fortified his army, and kept up an open communication with Bo&s;ton by a water carriage, which he would have commanded through the aid of the navy, on each &s;ide of the penin&s;ula. Had he made this manae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vre, the provincials mu&s;t have made a rapid retreat from Breed's hill, to e&s;cape having his troops in the rear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd being enclo&s;ed. It was &s;aid that General Clinton propo&s;ed it. The rejection of that propo&s;al greatly weakened the Briti&s;h army, and probably prevented the ruin of the A|mericans.</P>
<P>In July, the congre&s;s received a letter from the convention of Georgia, &s;etting forth, that the colony had acceded to the general
<PB N="74" REF="025347_0074_0FCCFF6947FE10F8">a&s;&s;ociation, and appointed delegates to attend the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Georgia to the colonies occa&s;ioned their being afterwards called <HI>The Thirteen United Colonies.</HI> The fir&s;t ho&s;tilities that happened in this part between the oppo|&s;ite parties, commenced about the middle of November, when a number of royali&s;ts at|tacked the Americans, and obliged them, after three days, to &s;urrender a fort they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, in which they expected to make an effectual re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the month of November, the New-York convention having re&s;olved upon the removal of the cannon from the battery of the city, Captain Sears was appointed to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Captain Vandeput, of the A&s;ia man of war, was privately informed of the de&s;ign, and prepared to oppo&s;e its execution. Learning when it was to be attempted, he appointed a boat to watch the motion of the people a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e about the dead of night. The &s;ailors in the boat giv|ing the &s;ignal, with a fla&s;h of powder, of what was going forwards, the per&s;ons on &s;hore mi&s;took it for an attempt to fire a mu&s;|ket at them, and immediately aimed a volly of &s;hot at the boat, by which a man was killed. Captain Vandeput &s;oon after com|menced a firing from the A&s;ia with grape &s;hot, &s;wivel &s;hot, 18 and 24 pounders, with|out killing a &s;ingle per&s;on, and wounded
<PB N="75" REF="025347_0075_0FCCFF6B77FDD4F0">only three, two &s;lightly, the other lo&s;t the calf of his leg. He then cea&s;ed for a con|&s;iderable time, &s;uppo&s;ing that the people had de&s;i&s;ted from their purpo&s;e, while they were only changing their mode of operation.</P>
<P>Capt. Sears provided a deceiving party, intended to draw the A&s;ia's fire from the line of the working party. He &s;ent the former behind a brea&s;t-work, by which they were &s;ecured by dodging down upon ob&s;erving the fla&s;h of the A&s;ia's guns. When all was in readine&s;s, they huzzaed, and &s;ung out their notes as though rugging in uni&s;on, and fired from the walls; while the working party &s;i|lently got off twenty-one eighteen pounders, with carriages, empty cartridges, rammers, &amp;c</P>
<P>Upon hearing the noi&s;e and &s;eeing the fire of the mu&s;ketry the captain ordered the A&s;ia to fire a whole broad&s;ide towards that part of the fort, where the deceiving party had &s;ecured them&s;elves, without intending any particular injury to the city. However &s;ome of the &s;hot flew into the city, and did damage.</P>
<P>This affair happened at a very late hour, between twelve and two, and threw the cit|izens into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The di&s;tre&s;s of the New Yorkers was very much encrea&s;ed by a painful apprehen&s;ion, that Capt. Vandeput would renew his firing upon the city. A removal of men, women, chil|dren,
<PB N="76" REF="025347_0076_0FCCFF6D219D4920">and goods in&s;tantly commenced, and continued for &s;ome time. Matters were however &s;o far adju&s;ted, as to quiet the appre|hen&s;ions of the people, in reference to their &s;uffering further from the fire of the A&s;ia. To prevent it, the convention permitted Abraham Lott <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to &s;upply his maje&s;ty's &s;hips, &s;tationed at Newyork, with all nece&s;&s;a|ries, as well fre&s;h as &s;alted, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;hips.</P>
<P>In the month of November, the general a&s;&s;embly of Rhode-I&s;land pa&s;&s;ed an act for the capital puni&s;hment of per&s;ons, who &s;hould be found guilty of holding a traiterous cor|re&s;pondence with the mini&s;try of Great Bri|tain, or any of their officers or agents, or of &s;upplying the mini&s;terial army or navy, employed again&s;t the United Colonies, with provi&s;ions, arms, &amp;c. or of acting as pilots on board any of their ve&s;&s;els. They al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;eque&s;tering the e&s;tates of &s;everal per&s;ons, whom they con&s;idered as a|vowed enemies to the liberties of America.</P>
<P>On the night of the 26th of Augu&s;t, about 2000 American troops entrenched on Plow|ed hill, within point blank &s;hot of the Bri|ti&s;h on Bunker's hill; and nothwith&s;tanding a continual fire almo&s;t all the day following, they had only two killed and two wounded. The Briti&s;h finding that their firing did not an&s;wer, relaxed, and ofter a while de&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="77" REF="025347_0077_0FCCFF6F2807E108">entirely, and the Americans remained quiet in their new po&s;t.</P>
<P>In the beginning of September, General Wa&s;hington received a very acceptable re|mittance of 7000 pounds weight of powder, which had been very &s;carce in the American army.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington, having received plea&s;|ing accounts from Canada, being a&s;&s;ured that neither Indians nor Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ians could be prevailed upon to act agai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Americans, concerted the plan of detaching a body of troops from the head quarters, acro&s;s the country to Quebec. He communicated the &s;ame to Gen. Schuyler, who approved it, and all things were got in readine&s;s. They &s;et out on the expedition on the 13th of Sep|tember, under the command of Col. Arnold, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Colonels Green and Enos, and Majors Megis and Bigelow, the whole force amounting to about eleven hundred men.</P>
<P>On the 18th of October, Capt. Morvat de&s;troyed 139 hou&s;es, 278 &s;tores and other buildings, the far greater and better part of the town of Falmouth, in the northern part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The inhabitants in com|pliance with a re&s;olve of the provincial congre&s;s, to prevent tories carrying out their effects, gave &s;ome violent ob&s;truction to the loading of a ma&s;t &s;hip, which drew upon them the indignation of the Briti&s;h admiral.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="025347_0078_0FCCFF70024EE970">
In the mean time, Gen. Montgomery was &s;ent forward to Ticonderoga, with a body of troops; and being arrived at the I&s;le aux Noix, he drew up a declaration, which he &s;ent among the Canadians by Col. Allen and Major Brown, a&s;&s;uring them, that the army was de&s;igned only again&s;t the Engli&s;h gari&s;ons, and not again&s;t the country, their liberties, or religion.</P>
<P>Col. Allen and Major Brown being on their return, after executing the commi&s;&s;ion, with which the general had entru&s;ted them, the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter advi&s;ed Col. Allen, to halt, and propo&s;ed, that the Colonel &s;hould return to Longueil, procure canoes and cro&s;s the river St. Lawrence, a little north of Montreal, while he, the major, cro&s;&s;ed a little to the &s;outh of the town, with near 200 men, as he had boats &s;ufficient. The plan was ap|proved, and Col. Allen pa&s;&s;ed the river in the night. The major, by &s;ome means, failed on his part, and Col. Allen found him|&s;elf, the next morning, in a critical &s;ituation, but concluded on defending him&s;elf. Gen. Carleton, learning how weak Colonel Allen was, marched out again&s;t him with about forty regulars, together with Canadians, Engli&s;h and Indians, amounting to &s;ome hundreds, The colonel defended him&s;elf with much. bravery; but being de&s;erted by &s;everal, chiefly Canadians, and having had fifteen of his men killed, was under the nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="79" REF="025347_0079_0FCCFF71AFD62F70">of &s;urrendering with thirty one effec|tives and &s;even wounded. He was directly put in irons.</P>
<P>On the 4th of October, a party of Cana|dians, who had joined and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the be&s;iegers, entrenched them&s;elves on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake, on which the enemy &s;ent an armed &s;loop with troops to drive them away; but the Canadians attacked the &s;loop with vigour, killed a number of the men, and obliged her to return to St. John's in a &s;hattered condition.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the main body of the army decamped from the &s;outh, and marched to the north &s;ide of the fort. In the evening, they began to throw up a brea&s;t work, in or|der to erect a battery of cannon and mortars. The continental troops brought &s;uch a &s;pirit of liberty into the field, and thought &s;o free|ly for them&s;elves, that they would not bear ei|ther &s;ubordination or di&s;cipline. The gene|rals could not, in truth, direct their opera|tions, and would not have &s;tayed an hour at their head, had they not feared that the exam|ple would be too generally followed, and &s;o have injured the public &s;ervice. There was a great want of powder, which, with the di&s;orderly behaviour of the troops, was a damp to the hope of terminating the &s;iege &s;ucce&s;sfully. The pro&s;pect, however, &s;oon brightened, for the Americans planned an at|tack upon Chamble&eacute;, and in batteaus carried
<PB N="80" REF="025347_0080_0FCCDB8088D19180">down the artillery, pa&s;t the fort of St. John's. After a &s;hort demur, it &s;urrender|ed to the majors Brown and Living&s;ton. The greate&s;t acqui&s;ition was about &s;ix tons of powder, which gave great encouragement to the provincials.</P>
<P>On the 12th of November, Gen. Mont|gomery pre&s;&s;ed on to Montreal, which, not being capable of making any defence, Gov. Carleton quitted it one day, and the Ameri|can general entered it the next.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, Gen. Montgomery marched on for the capital, and on the 5th of December appeared before Quebec. The garri&s;on con|&s;i&s;ted of about fifteen hundred, while the be&s;iegers were &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of little more than half that number. Upon his appear|ing before the city, he &s;ent forward a flag of truce, which was fired upon by order of Sir Guy Carleton. At this Gen. Montgomery was &s;o provoked, that the next day he wrote to Sir Guy, and in his letter, departed from the common mode of conveying his &s;enti|ments; he made u&s;e of threats and language which in his cooler moments he would have declined.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on, he &s;et about erecting works. His batteries were compo&s;ed of &s;now and water, which &s;oon became &s;olid ice. He planted on them five pieces of ordnance, twelve and nine
<PB N="81" REF="025347_0081_0FCCFF75F906BD58">pounders, with one howitzer; but the artil|lery was inadequate, and made no impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the evening, a council was held by all the commanding officers of Col. Arnold's detachment, and a large majority were for &s;torming the garri&s;on, as &s;oon as the men were provided with bayonets, &s;pears, hatchets and hand grenades. The plan of &s;torming the garri&s;on was wholly the work of General Montgomery, who, in the council of war held on the occa&s;ion, &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity. practicability, and importance of it, in &s;uch a clear and convincing manner, that they unani|mou&s;ly agreed to the mea&s;ure. The attempt had the appearance of ra&s;hne&s;s; but the ge|neral was per&s;uaded that men, who had be|haved &s;o bravely, would follow him, and that Sir Gay Carleton's forces would not fight, when actual &s;ervice commenced.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t of December, the troops a&s;|&s;embled at the hour appointed. They were to make the attack by the way of Cape Dia|mond, at the general's quarters on the heights of Abraham, and were headed by the Gen. him&s;elf. Col. Arnold was made to attack through the &s;uburbs of St. Roe. Col. Living|&s;ton and Major Brown were to make a fal&s;e attack upon the walls, to the &s;outhward of St. John's gate, and in the mean time to &s;et fire to the gate with the combu&s;tibles prepared for that purpo&s;e. The colonel was al&s;o to give the &s;ignals for the combination of the at|tacks,
<PB N="82" REF="025347_0082_0FCCFF78DE8C9650">which were to begin exactly at five o'clock. It is &s;aid that Capt. Fra&s;er, of the regulars, who was then on piquet, going his rounds, &s;aw the rockets fired off as &s;ignals, and, forming a conjecture of what was going forward, beat to arms without orders, and &s;o prepared the garri&s;on for defence.</P>
<P>The different routes the a&s;&s;ailants had to make, the depth of the &s;now, and other ob&s;tacles, prevented the execution of Living|&s;ton's command. The general moved with his divi&s;ion, attended by a number of carpenters, to the piquets at Cape Diamond. The&s;e were &s;oon cut with the &s;aws, and the general pulled them down him&s;elf. He then entered, attended by the carpenters and &s;ome of his of|ficers.</P>
<P>On their entrance, their guides for&s;ook them, which alarmed the general and other officers, who were unacquainted with the pa&s;s and &s;ituation of the enemy's artillery. However, they pre&s;&s;ed on, and the general, ob&s;erving that the troops did not follow with &s;pirit, called out, "Fie, for &s;hame! will the New York troops de&s;ert the cau&s;e in this cri|tical moment? Will you not follow when your general leads? Pu&s;h on, brave boys, Quebec is ours." A few acted with re&s;olu|tion, advanced, and attacked the guardhou&s;e, when the enemy gave a di&s;charge of grape|&s;hot from their cannon, and al&s;o of &s;mall arms, which proved fatal to the general, his

<PB N="83" REF="025347_0084_0FCCFF7B37F90A60">aide de camp, Capt. Chee&s;eman, and others. The firing from the guardhou&s;e cea&s;ed, by the enemy's quitting their po&s;t, and the op|portunity offered for the a&s;&s;ailants to pu&s;h for|ward with &s;ucce&s;s; but the Deputy Quarter|ma&s;ter General, Campbell, with the rank of a Colonel, a&s;&s;umed the command, ordered a retreat, which took place, and the wounded were carried off to the camp.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion under Col. Arnold was equal|ly un&s;ucce&s;sful. The Colonel received a wound in one of his legs from a mu&s;ket ball, and was carried to the general ho&s;pital. His men maintained their ground till ten o'clock, when, all hopes of relief being over, they were obliged at la&s;t to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. In this attack the provincials lo&s;t up|wards of an hundred men. Gen. Mont|gomery was &s;hot through both his thighs and his head. His body was taken up the next day, an elegant coffin was prepared, and he was &s;oon after decently interred. The gen|eral was tall and &s;lender, well limbed, of ea&s;y, graceful, and manly addre&s;s. He had the love, e&s;teem, and confidence of the whole army; he was of a good family in Ireland, and had &s;erved with reputation in the late war with France. His excellent qualities and di&s;po&s;ition procured him an uncommon &s;hare of private affection, and his abilities of public e&s;teem. His death was con&s;idered as
<PB N="84" REF="025347_0085_0FCCFF825B2280B0">a greater lo&s;s to the American cau&s;e, than all the others with which it was accompanied.</P>
<P>When the continental troops had connect|ed after the un&s;ucce&s;sful attack on Quebec, there aro&s;e a di&s;pute who &s;hould command, and whether it was advi&s;eable to rai&s;e the &s;iege, or wait till a reinforcement &s;hould ar|rive. A council of war agreed, that Col. Arnold &s;hould command, and &s;hould continue the &s;iege, or rather the blockade, which was accordingly done, apparently at no &s;mall ri&s;k, as they had not more than four hundred men fit for duty; but they retired about three miles from the city, and po&s;ted them&s;elves advantageou&s;ly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now return to Bo&s;ton and its envi|rons, and &s;ee what was tran&s;acting there. On the 15th of February, 1776, the &s;trength of the ice having been tried in one place, and the fro&s;t continuing, Gen. Wa&s;hington was de&s;irous of embracing the &s;ea&s;on for pa&s;|&s;ing over it, from Cambridge &s;ide into Bo&s;|ton. He laid before the council of war the following que&s;tion: "A &s;troke well aimed at this critical juncture may put a final period to the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and re&s;tore peace and tranquility &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for; and therefore, whether part of Cambridge and Roxborough bays being frozen over, a gen|eral a&s;&s;ault &s;hould not be made on Bo&s;ton?"</P>
<P>Gen. Ward oppo&s;ed the idea, &s;aying, "The attack mu&s;t be made with a view of bringing on an engagement, or of driving the enemy out of Bo&s;ton, and either end will be an&s;wered much better by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Dor|che&s;ter heights." When the votes were called for, the majority were again&s;t the at|tack. It was however determined to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Dorche&s;ter heights, which was accordingly afterwards accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 5th of March, the Briti&s;h admiral informed Gen. Howe, that if the Americans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e heights, he could not keep
<PB N="86" REF="025347_0087_0FCCFF859856A2F8">one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips in the harbour. Every de&s;ign of Gen. Howe to force the American works on the hill being fru&s;trated, a coun&s;el of war was called, when it was agreed to evacuate the town as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble. The time that had been gained by the Americans for &s;trengthening their works, took away all hopes of any &s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts to be made on them by the Briti&s;h forces. The Americans had provided a great number of barrels, filled with &s;tones, gravel and &s;and, which were placed round the works, ready to be rolled down, with a view to break the lines of any ho&s;tile advan|cing troops, when a&s;cending the hills.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March, there was a gene|ral hurry and confu&s;ion in Bo&s;ton, every one, in the royal intere&s;t, being bu&s;y in preparing to quit the town, and to carry off every thing that was valuable. A flag was &s;ent out from the &s;elect men, acquainting Gen. Wa&s;hington with the intention of the troops, and that general Howe was di&s;po&s;ed to leave the town &s;tanding, provided he could retire uninterrupted. Gen. Wa&s;hington bound him|&s;elf under no obligation, but expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in words, which admitted of a favorable con&s;truction; and intimated his good wi&s;hes for the pre&s;ervation of Bo&s;ton. At four o'clock, in the morning, of the 17th, the embarkation was completed, and before ten the whole fleet was under &s;ail, and the pro|vincials
<PB N="87" REF="025347_0088_0FCCFF87DFFFD948">&s;oon after took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of what was do|ing in Virginia. Towards the clo&s;e of 1775 the Liverpool frigate arrived at Norfolk from Great Britain. Soon after, the captain &s;ent a flag of truce, and demanded to be inform|ed, whether his maje&s;ty's &s;hip of war would be &s;upplied from the &s;hore with provi|&s;ions. The reply was in the negative; and the &s;hips in the harbor being continu|ally annoyed by the riflemen from behind the buildings and warehou&s;es on the wharfs, it was determined to di&s;lodge them by de&s;troy|ing the town.</P>
<P>Previous notice was given, that the wo|men, children, and other innocent per&s;ons, might remove from the danger. The en|trance of the new year was &s;ignalized at four o'clock in the morning, by a violent can|nonade from the Liverpool, two &s;loops of war, and the governor's armed &s;hip the Dunmore, &s;econded by parties of &s;ailors and marines, who landed and fired the hou&s;es next the water. Where buildings, in&s;tead of being covered with tile, &s;late, or lead, are covered with &s;hingles, (thin light pieces of fir or cedar, half a yard in length, and about &s;ix inches broad) let the wind be ever &s;o moderate, they will, upon being fired, be likely to communicate the conflagration to a di&s;tance, &s;hould the weather be dry, by the
<PB N="88" REF="025347_0089_0FCCFF88CD6E2028">burning &s;hingles being driven by the force of the flames to the tops of other hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus the whole town was reduced to a&s;hes, that the Americans might have no &s;hel|ter, &s;hould they be inclined to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t on the &s;pot. A few men were killed and wounded at the burning of Norfolk, the mo&s;t populous and con&s;iderable town for commerce of any in Virginia. It contained about 6000 inhabitants, and many in affluent circum&s;tances. The whole lo&s;s was e&s;ti|mated at more than three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. However urgent the nece&s;|&s;ity, it was an odious &s;ight to &s;ee the gov|ernor, Lord Dunmore, a principal actor in burning and de&s;troying the be&s;t town in his government. The horrid di&s;tre&s;&s;es brought upon numbers of innocent per&s;ons, by the&s;e operations, mu&s;t wound the feelings of all who are not hardened by a party &s;pirit.</P>
<P>While matters were thus tran&s;acting in America, the mini&s;try at home gave into great expences, to &s;upply the army at Bo&s;ton with fre&s;h provi&s;ions and other articles. Sir Peter Parker and Earl Cornwallis, with the Acteon and Thunder bomb, &s;ailed from Port mouth for Corke, to convoy the troops and tran&s;ports there to America; but, owing to &s;ome delays, the fleet did not &s;ail before the 13th of February. It con&s;i&s;ted of forty-three &s;ail, and about 2500 troops.</P>

On the 14th of March, a fre&s;h attempt was made in the hou&s;e of lords, to prevent a continuance of ho&s;tilities, which &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded, that in the May following, letters patent, by his maje&s;ty's orders, pa&s;&s;ed under the great &s;eal, con&s;tituting Lord Howe and Gen.

The &s;ame month Commodore Hotham, with all the tran&s;ports, having the fir&s;t divi&s;|ion of He&s;&s;ians on board, &s;ailed from St. Helen's for North America. But let us re|turn to Canada, and attend to what was going forward in that quarter.</P>
<P>The blockade of Quebec was continued; but the fears of the Americans were great, as they had no more than 400 men to do duty, while there were upwards of three times the number in the city; they were in daily expectation that the be&s;ieged would &s;ally out upon them. At length a &s;mall reinforce|ment arrived, which enabled them to take a little more re&s;t, though the army was again &s;oon reduced by the &s;mall pox that broke out among them.</P>
<P>Towards the end of May, &s;everal regi|ments arrived from England, and the Briti&s;h forces in Canada were e&s;timated at about 13,000 men. The general rendezvous was
<PB N="90" REF="025347_0091_0FCCFF8DF4FEB238">appointed to be at Three Rivers, half way between Quebec and Montreal. The Amer|icans now formed a plan to &s;urpri&s;e the Bri|ti&s;h troops, and for that purpo&s;e marched un|der cover of the night, on the 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of June, is order to attack them a little before day|break. Gen. Thomp&s;on, who commanded in this expedition, had procured a Canadian guide, who was either ignorant or unfaith|ful; for, a little before &s;un ri&s;e, he found his forces were out of the proper road. They returned, but lo&s;ing their way by the &s;ide of the river, they were &s;oon in view of &s;ome of the enemy's boats, between which and the flanking par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;everal balls were exchanged. They then quickened their pace, and con|tinued advancing in &s;ight of the &s;hipping, with drums beating and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es playing, as they knew they were di&s;covered. The general, judging there was no po&s;&s;ibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;hips, without being expo&s;ed to all their fire, and yet determining to per&s;i&s;t in the expedi|tion, filed off at a right angle from the river. He meant to take a circuitous route, and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er the town on the back &s;ide. A bad mora&s;s interpo&s;ed, the troops entered it, and the men were almo&s;t mired. About nine o'clock, they came to a cleared &s;pot, formed, and got into &s;ome order about ten. They advanced, but before the rear had got off the place of formation, the front received a heavy fire from the enemy, which &s;truck them with
<PB N="91" REF="025347_0092_0FCCFF8F77D843C0">terror. The fire was in&s;tantly repeated, and though the balls flew over the heads of the troops, without doing any material execu|tion, they gave way, and crowded back, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, which left them with|out a leader, &s;o that every one did as he plea&s;ed. They turned their &s;aces up the river and ha&s;tened through the &s;wamp as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. About eleven they began to collect, and &s;oon learned from the Canadians, that the enemy had &s;ent a detachment, with &s;everal field-pieces by land, to cut off their retreat, and a party by water to &s;eize their boats. About four they were told, that the enemy had &s;ecured the bridge before them, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t pa&s;s. They were al&s;o convinced that a large body were clo&s;ely in their rear. Col. Maxwell ordered all who had collected together to halt, call|ed the officers to him, and &s;aid, "What &s;hall we do? Shall we fight tho&s;e in the front or in the rear? Shall we tamely &s;ubmit? or &s;hall we turn off into the woods, and each man &s;hift for him&s;elf?" The la&s;t propo&s;al was preferred, but the enemy was &s;o near, that the rear of the Americans was expo&s;ed to another tremendous fire, while going down the hill into the woods, but the halls flew over them without injuring any. The per|&s;on, who was entru&s;ted with the care of the boats, had removed them in time to a &s;ecure place; &s;o that the lo&s;s of the Americans,
<PB N="92" REF="025347_0093_0FCCFF90469D67B8">which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been much great|er, amounted only to about 200 pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The troops that e&s;caped began to collect about ten the next day, and by noon were con&s;iderably numerous. They got along by degrees, and by &s;un &s;et the day following ar|rived oppo&s;ite Sorel. Gen. Thomp&s;on and Col. Irwin, the &s;econd in command, with &s;ome other officers were taken. The killed and wounded of the king's troops were tri|fling.</P>
<P>The king's forces having joined at Three Rivers, proceeded by land and water to Sorel, off which the fleet arrived in the evening a few hours after the rear of the Americans had left it. A con&s;iderable body was landed, and the command of the column given to Gen. Burgoyne, with in&s;tuctions, to pur&s;ue the continental army up the river to St. John's, but without hazarding any thing till another column on his right &s;hould be able to co-operate wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h him. Sir Guy Carleton's extra|ordinary precau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion to put nothing to hazard, when not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, gave the Ame|ricans the opportunity of e&s;caping. Had Burgoyne been in&s;tructed to pre&s;s on with the utmo&s;t expedition, great numbers of the provincials mu&s;t have been made pri&s;oners, and but few would have crofied Lake Cham|plain.

To return to Bo&s;ton. The Briti&s;h Com|modore Banks, omitting to leave crui&s;ers in the bay, afforded an opportunity to the Ame|rican privateers of taking a number of High|landers. Three days after his quitting it, the George and Annabella tran&s;ports entered, after a pa&s;&s;age of &s;even weeks from Scotland, during the cour&s;e of which they had not an opportunity of &s;peaking with a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, that could give them the &s;malle&s;t information of the Briti&s;h troops having evacuated Bo&s;|ton.

<P>On the 25th of June, Gen. Howe ar|rived at Sandy Hook in the Greyhound fri|gate. He &s;oon received from Gov.

<P>On the fir&s;t of July, congre&s;s re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole upon the &s;ubject of independence; but neither colonies nor members being unanimous, it was po&s;tponed till the next day. On the fourth, they had it under further con&s;idera|tion, when the declaration of independence
<PB N="95" REF="025347_0096_0FCCFF94CDA28250">was agreed to and adopted. The title of it was,
<Q>"A declaration by the Repre&s;entatives of the United States of America in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled."</Q></P>
<P>The preamble follows in the&s;e words.&mdash;"When, in the cour&s;e of human events, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political bands, which have connected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume, among the powers of the earth, the &s;eperate and equal &s;tation, to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the opinions of mankind require that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es that impel them to the &s;eperation.</P>
<P>"We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal&mdash;that they are endowed by their creator with certain unali|enable rights, among which are life, liber|ty and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s&mdash;that to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the&s;e rights, governments are in&s;ti|tuted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the con&s;ent of the governed&mdash;that whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;ti|tute a new government, laying its foundations upon &s;uch principles, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem
<PB N="96" REF="025347_0097_0FCD000C877587D8">mo&s;t likely &s;o effect their &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all experience hath &s;hown, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;urpations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch go|vernment, and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the pa|tient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies, and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity that con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of government.</P>
<P>The declaration proceeds to give a hi&s;tory of repeated injuries and u&s;urpations, all hav|ing in direct object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of and ab&s;olute tyranny over tho&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>On the 8th of July, at twelve o'clock the declaration of independence was pro|claimed at the &s;tate-hou&s;e in Philiadelphia, amid&s;t the greate&s;t acclamations. The next day, in con&s;equence of general orders, it was read at the head of each brigade of the continental army at New York, and every where received with loud huzzas, and the utmo&s;t demon&s;trations of joy. The &s;ame evening, the eque&s;trian &s;tatus of the king

<P>In the month of Augu&s;t, Gen.

The nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures being taken by the fleet for covering the de&s;cent, the army was landed, without oppo&s;ition, between two &s;mall towns, Utretcht and Grave&s;end, not far from the Narrows, on the neare&s;t &s;hore to Staten I&s;land.</P>
<P>On this i&s;land are &s;everal pa&s;&s;es through the mountains or hills, which are ea&s;ily de|fen&s;ible, being very narrow, and the lands high and mountainous on each &s;ide. The&s;e were the only roads that could be pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;outh &s;ide of the hills to the American lines, excepta road leading round the ea&s;terly end of the hills to Jamaica. An early at|tention had been given to the importance of the&s;e pa&s;&s;es. To the &s;econd of them, the &s;mall American parties, patroling on the coa&s;ts, re|tired upon the approach of the Briti&s;h boats with the troops. Lord Cornwallis pu&s;hed on immediately with the re&s;erve and &s;ome other &s;orces: but finding the Americans in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s, in compliance with orders he ri&s;ked no attack.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="025347_0100_0FCCDB8C8D405198">
The Americans had on each of the three pa&s;&s;es or roads a guard of Soo men; and to the ea&s;t of them in the wood, Col. Mites was placed with his battalion to guard the road from the &s;outh of the hills to Jamaica, and to watch the motion of the enemy on that &s;ide, with orders to keep a party con|&s;tantly reconnoitring to and acro&s;s the Ja|maica road. The centinels were &s;o placed as to keep a continual communication be|tween the three guards on the three roads.</P>
<P>On the 26th of Augu&s;t, Gen. Howe, having fully &s;ettled a plan of &s;urprize, Gen, de Hei&s;ter, with his He&s;&s;ians, took po&s;t at Flatbu&s;h in the evening, and compo&s;ed the centre. About nine o'clock the &s;ame night, the principal army, containing much the greater part of the Briti&s;h forces under the commands of Gen. Clinton, Earl Percy, and Lord Cornwallis, marched in order to gain the road leading round the ea&s;terly end of the hills to Jamaica, and &s;o to turn the le&s;t of the Americans. Col. Miles who&s;e duty it was to guard this road, &s;uffered the Briti&s;h to march not le&s;s than &s;ix miles, till they were near two miles in the rear of the guards, before he di&s;covered and gave notice of their approach.</P>
<P>The next day, before day-break, Gen. Clinton arrived within half a mile of the road, when he halted, and &s;ettled his di&s;po&s;i|tion for the attack. One of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roles fell
<PB N="100" REF="025347_0101_0FCCDB8E493698C8">in with a patrol of American officers on hor&s;eback who were trepanned and made pri&s;oners. Gen. Sullivan, though in expec|tation that they would bring him intelligence, neglected &s;ending out a fre&s;h patrol on finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed. Clinton, learning from the captured officers, that the americans had not occupied the road, de|tached a battalion of light infantry to &s;ecure it, and advancing with his troops upon the fir&s;t appearance of day, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the heights that commanded the road.</P>
<P>About midnight, the guard, con&s;i&s;ting all of New Yorkers and Penn&s;ylvanians, per|ceiving that there was danger at hand, fled without firing a gun, and carried to Gen. Par&s;ons, who commanded them, the account of the enemy's advancing in great numbers by that road. Gen. Grant's movements were to divert the attention of the Ameri|cans from the left, where the main attack was to be made by Gen Clinton. By day-light, Gen. Par&s;ons perceived, that the Briti&s;h were got through the wood, and were de|&s;cending on the north &s;ide. He took twenty of his fugitive guard, being all he could collect, and po&s;ted them on a height in front of the Briti&s;h, about half a mile di&s;tant, which halted their column, and gave time for Lord Sterling to come up with his forces, amounting to about 1500, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="101" REF="025347_0102_0FCCFF964C1BDA80" MS="y">him&s;elf of a hill about two miles from the camp.</P>
<P>The engagement began &s;oon after day|break, by the He&s;&s;ians from Flatbu&s;h under Gen Hei&s;ter, and by Gen Grant on the coa&s;t; and a warm ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ade, with a bri&s;k fire of &s;mall arms, were eagerly &s;upported on both &s;ides for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. The Americans oppo&s;ing Gen. Hei&s;ter were the fir&s;t who were appri&s;ed of the march of the Briti&s;h troops under Gen. Clinton They accordingly retreated in large bodies, and in tolerable order, to recover their camp; but they were &s;oon interrupted by the right wing under Gen. Clinton, who, having halt|ed and refre&s;hed his forces after pa&s;&s;ing the heights, continued his march, and getting into the rear of the left of the Americans, about half pa&s;t eight o'clock, attacked them with his light infantry and light dragoons, while quitting the heights to return to their lines. They were driven back, and again met the He&s;&s;ians, and thus were they alter|nately chaced and intercepted. In the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, &s;ome of their regi|ments, overpowered and out numbered as they were, forced their wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the camps through all the dangers with which they were pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Americans under Lord Stirling, who were engaged with Gen. Grant, behaved with great bravery and re&s;olution; but were
<PB N="102" REF="025347_0103_0FCCFF99961EC010">&s;o late in their knowledge of what pa&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere, that their retreat was intercepted by &s;ome of the Briti&s;h troops, who, be&s;ides turning the hills and the American left, had traver&s;ed the whole extent of country in their rear. Several broke through the enemy's lines and got into the woods. Gen. Par&s;ons, with a &s;mall party, e&s;caped by doing the &s;ame; numbers threw them&s;elves in the mar&s;h at Gorvan's Cove, &s;ome were drowned, and others peri&s;hed in the mud. However a con|&s;iderable body e&s;caped to the lines. The na|ture of the country, and the variety of the ground, occa&s;ioned a continuance and exten|&s;ion of &s;mall engagements, pur&s;uits and &s;laughter, which la&s;ted for many hours before the &s;cene clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops di&s;played great valour and activity on this occa&s;ion. So impetuous was their ardor, that it was with difficulty they could be re&s;trained, by Gen. Howe's orders, from attacking the American lines. They would probably have entered them, had not the works been completed the night before the action, by clo&s;ing an opening on the right, and placing an abattis before it. The Americans were mo&s;t completely &s;urpri&s;ed and effectually entrapped. Col. Smallwood's Maryland regiment &s;uffered extremely, and was almo&s;t cut to pieces, lo&s;ing 259 men. The lo&s;s was much regretted, on account of their being young men of the be&s;t-families in
<PB N="103" REF="025347_0104_0FCCFF9B057C4430">the country, All who were engaged in the actions of this day did not di&s;play the &s;ame courage; nor was it to be expected from &s;uch raw troops. Many e&s;caped from the want of di&s;cipline; for they broke at the &s;ight of danger and &s;aved them&s;elves by flight, whereas otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have been killed or taken. Large bodies however were cap|tured. Gen. Sullivan, Lord Stirling, and Gen. Udell, be&s;ides three colonels, four lieutenant colonels, three majors, 18 cap|tains, 43 lieutenants, 11 en&s;igns, an adju|tant, three &s;urgeons, and two volunteers, were made pri&s;oners, together with 1006 privates, in all 1007. As among the pri|&s;oners the wounded were included, an allow|ance of between four and five hundred for killed, drowned, peri&s;hed in the woods, the mud, and the like, may be reckoned about the mark; the lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h, in killed and wounded, did not exceed 318, of whom only 61 were killed. After the battle, the Americans retreated to New-York, to which place they cro&s;&s;ed over under the favour of a fog, taking with them all their military &s;tores, and leaving nothing behind them hut a few pieces of cannon and &s;ome trifling matters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the affair of Long I&s;land, en|deavors were u&s;ed by the Americans to keep up the &s;pirits of the people, by puf|fing accounts of the extraordinary bravery of their troops, and the de&s;truction they made of the enemy. But that matters were not very promi&s;ing appears from a letter of Gen. Mercer who commanded the flying camp, dated Sept. 4th, wherein he writes. "Gen. Wa&s;hington has not, &s;o far as I have &s;een, 5000 men to be depended on for the &s;ervice of a campaign; and I have not 1000. Both
<PB N="105" REF="025347_0106_0FCCFF9DDB3D4FF8">our armies are compo&s;ed of raw militia, perpetually fluctuating between the camp and their farms; poorly armed, and &s;till wor&s;e di&s;ciplined. The&s;e are not a match for, were their numbers equal to, veteran troops, well fitted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ged on by able offi|cers. Numbers and di&s;cipline mu&s;t at la&s;t prevail. Giving &s;oldiers, or even the lower orders of mankind, the choice of officers, will for ever mar the di&s;cipline of armies."</P>
<P>Gen. Howe, having fully prepared for a de&s;cent on New-York I&s;land, embarked a &s;trong divi&s;ion of the army under the com|mand of Gen. Clinton and others, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> boats, at the head of Newtown inlet, and at ano|ther place higher up, where they could not be ob&s;erved by the Americans, who expected the attack would be made on the &s;ide next to the Ea&s;t river, and had therefore thrown up lines and works to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the 15th of September, about eleven o'clock, Gen. Howe's troops landed, under the cover of five &s;hips of war, in two divi|&s;ions, the He&s;&s;ians in one place, and the Bri|ti&s;h in another. As &s;oon as Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton heard the firing of the men of war, he rode with all di&s;patch towards the lines; but to his great mortification, found the troops po&s;ted in them retreating with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and tho&s;e ordered to &s;upport them, Par&s;ons's and Fellows's Brigade fly|ing in every direction, and in the greate&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="025347_0107_0FCCFFA0040E7F78">confu&s;ion. His attempts to &s;top them were fruitle&s;s, though he drew his &s;word, threat|ened to run them through, and cocked and &s;napped his pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>On the appearance of a &s;mall party of the enemy, not more than &s;ixty or &s;eventy, their di&s;order was encrea&s;ed, and they ran off with|out firing a &s;ingle &s;hot, leaving the general in a hazardous &s;ituation, &s;o that his attend|ants to extricate him out of it, caught the bridle of his hor&s;e, and gave him a different direction.</P>
<P>Three large &s;hips were &s;lationed in the North river, oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t river, and both kept up a con&s;tant cannon|ading with grape &s;hot and langrage quite acro&s;s the i&s;land. The He&s;&s;ians, upon their landing, &s;eized and &s;ecured, in a neighbor|ing building, as enemies, &s;ome per&s;ons who had been placed there to &s;erve as guides, which for a while &s;ubjected them to a diffi|culty.</P>
<P>When the regulars were completely land|ed, they advanced towards the King&s;bridge|road. The American brigades, which had fled on the enemy's approaching the lines, did not &s;top till they were met by Col. Glover's and five other brigades, who were ha&s;tening down to them. As &s;oon as they joined, the whole marched forward, and took po&s;t on &s;ome heights, when &s;uddenly 8000 of the enemy appeared on the next height, and
<PB N="107" REF="025347_0108_0FCCFFA20AD9DCD0">halted. Gen. Wa&s;hington at fir&s;t con&s;ented, that his troops &s;hould march forward, and give them battle; but, on a &s;econd con&s;ider|ation, he gave counter orders, as he could not have any dependence on the militia and the flying camp, which compo&s;ed half the number then pre&s;ent. When the Americans retired, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pro&s;pect of action remained, the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington, while moving the army from New York, into the country, was care|ful to march and form the troops, &s;o as to make a front towards the enemy, from Ea&s;t Che&s;ter almo&s;t to White Plains, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the highway, thereby to &s;ecure the march of tho&s;e who were behind on their right and to defend the removal of the &s;ick, cannon and other matters of con&s;equence; but the want of many nece&s;&s;ary articles con|&s;iderably retarded their march.</P>
<P>On the 25th of October, the royal army moved in two columns, and took a po&s;ition they thought the mo&s;t advantageous. Ob|&s;erving, however, that Gen. Wa&s;hington's lines were much &s;trengthened by additional works, he deferred all further attack till the arrival of more troops. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes had already taken place, but nothing deci&s;ive had yet happened.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t day of October, Gen. Howe, being joined by the troops from Lord Percy, made di&s;po&s;itions for attacking the Ameri|can
<PB N="108" REF="025347_0109_0FCCFFA3863AB230" MS="y">can lines early the next morning; but an ex|treme wet night and morning prevented the execution at the time appointed, and it was not attempted afterwards, though the day proved fair. Gen. Wa&s;hington gained in|telligence of his danger from a de&s;erter, when he drew off mo&s;t of his troops at night, to|tally evacuated his camp early in the morn|ing of the fir&s;t of November, and took higher ground towards the North Ca&s;tle di&s;trict; leaving a &s;trong rear guard on the heights and in the woods of White Plains. Orders were given by Gen. Howe to attack this corps; but the execution of it was prevented by a violent rain.</P>
<P>Though this affair at White Plains made &s;o much noi&s;e at the time in which it hap|pened, no general action took place, and the Americans retreated, leaving the Engli&s;h in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York and the Jer&s;eys.</P>
<P>Gen. Wa&s;hington, however, &s;oon after made a de&s;cent on Jer&s;ey, and at Trenton &s;urpri&s;ed and took pri&s;oners 23 He&s;&s;ian offi|cers, and 886 men of the &s;ame nation. In the evening, Gen. Wa&s;hington repa&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and retired to Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>From this period to the month of June, 1777, nothing pa&s;&s;ed in Jer&s;ey but one con|tinued &s;cene of blood and &s;laughter among detached parties, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any deci&s;ive advan|tages being gained by either &s;ide. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0th of June, at ten o'clock in the morning,
<PB N="109" REF="025347_0110_0FCCFFA571F448C8">the Engli&s;h troops began to cro&s;s over to Sta|ten i&s;land, and the rear guard pa&s;&s;ed at two in the afternoon, without the lea&s;t appearance of an enemy. Thus they evacuated the Jer&s;eys, to enter upon new conque&s;ts, in hopes of reducing the United States to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</P>
<P>Let us now turn to the Briti&s;h operations in the North, which were taken out of the hands of Sir Guy Carleton, and committed to the charge of Gen. Burgoyne. The forces allotted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em, con&s;i&s;ting of Briti&s;h and German troops, amounted to more than 7000 men, exclu&s;ive of the artillery corps. A powerful bra&s;s train of artillery was fur|ni&s;hed, probably the fine&s;t, and the mo&s;t ex|cellently &s;upplied, as to officers and private men, that had ever been de&s;tined to &s;econd th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> operations of an army not exceeding the pre&s;ent number. The army was, in every re|&s;pect, in the be&s;t condition, the troops were in the highe&s;t &s;pirits, admirably di&s;ciplined, and uncommonly healthy.</P>
<P>The main body under Gen. Burgoyne, proceeded up Lake Champlain, landed and encamped at no great di&s;tance from Crown Point, where he met the indians in congre&s;s, and afterwards, in compliance with their cu&s;|toms, gave them a war fea&s;t. He made a &s;peech to them, calculated to excite their ardor in the common cau&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to repre&s;s their barbarity. He conjured
<PB N="110" REF="025347_0111_0FCCFFA6F193ECD0">them to kill tho&s;e only who oppo&s;ed them in arms; that old men, women, children, and pri&s;oners, &s;hould be held &s;acred from the knife or hatchet, even in the heat of actual conflict; that they &s;hould &s;calp tho&s;e only whom they had &s;lain in fair oppo&s;ition; but that under no pretence &s;hould they &s;calp the wounded. or even dying, much le&s;s kill per|&s;ons in that condition: they were promi&s;ed a compen&s;ation for pri&s;oners, but informed, that they &s;hould be called to account for &s;calps.</P>
<P>On the near approach of the right wing of the royal army on the Ticonderoga &s;ide, the Americans abandoned their works towards Lake George, and left Gen. Phillips to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the advantageous po&s;t of Mount Hope, without making any re&s;i&s;tance, which would have been ineffectual, and could have an|&s;wered no good purpo&s;e. That apparent &s;u|pinene&s;s and want of vigour, with which they were chargeable, was not occa&s;ioned by cowardice, but actual imbecility.</P>
<P>Gen. Burgoyne's troops proceeded with much expedition, in the con&s;truction of their works, the bringing up of artillery, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions; but what gave the greate&s;t alarm was, the rapid progre&s;s they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill. When once they had erected a battery on this height, only a few hours more would
<PB N="111" REF="025347_0112_0FCCFFA88A66FAA8" MS="y">have been required to have inve&s;ted the Ame|ricans on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Gen. St. Clair, having received intelli|gence by &s;pies, that in twenty four hours the inve&s;ture would be completed. when he &s;hould he cut off from all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uc|cour, Gen. Schuyler not having force &s;uffi|cient at fort Edward to relieve him he de|termined to evacuate his po&s;ts, though he knew it would produce &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hment as had not happened &s;ince the commencement of the war. He plainly perceived, that if he continued there, he &s;hould lo&s;e the army but &s;ave his character; whereas, by aban|doning the place, he &s;hould &s;ave the army, and lo&s;e his character. A council of war was called, and it was unanimou&s;ly concluded upon to evacuate as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of July the 6th. Gen. St. Clair left Ticonderoga. About three the troops were put in motion for the evacuation of the Mount; but Fer|mov having &s;et fire to his hou&s;e, contrary to po&s;itive orders, the whole Mount was en|lightened by it, &s;o that the enemy had an op|portunity of &s;eeing every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, which damped the &s;pirits of the Americans, and induced them to pu&s;h off in a di&s;orderly manner.</P>
<P>In the morning, Gen. Frazer, perceiving the evacuation, and that the Americans were retiring, commanded a pur&s;uit with his bri|gade,
<PB N="112" REF="025347_0113_0FCCFFA9B942DBF8">con&s;i&s;ting of the light troops, grena|diers, and &s;ome other corps. Gen. Reide&s;el, with mo&s;t of the Brun&s;wickers, was ordered by Gen. Burgoyne to join in the pur&s;uit, either to &s;upport Frazer, or to act &s;eperately. The latter continued the pur&s;uit through the day, and receiving intelligence, that St. Clair's rear was at no great di&s;tance, he or|dered his troops to lie that night on their arms. In the morning he came up with the Americans, commanded by Col. War|ner, who had, be&s;ides his own, the regiments of colonels Francis and Hale. The Briti&s;h advanced boldly, and the two bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es formed within about 60 yards of each other. Fra|zer began the at ack about &s;even o'clock, ex|pecting every moment to be joined by Reide|&s;el, and apprehending, that if he delayed, the enemy would e&s;cape. Hale being ap|prized of the danger, never brought his re|giment to the charge, but fled; &s;o that Warner could bring into action no more than about 700 men. The conflict was bloody: Francis fell fighting with great bravery, and Warner, his officers and &s;oldiers, behaved with much re&s;olution and gallantry; &s;o that the Briti&s;h broke and gave way, but &s;oon formed again, and running on the Americans with their bayonets, the latter were put into no &s;mall confu&s;ion, which was encrea&s;ed by the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tical arrival of Gen. Reide&s;el with the foremo&s;t of his column, con&s;i&s;ting of the
<PB N="113" REF="025347_0114_0FCCFFAD0531C9C8" MS="y">Cha&s;&s;eur company, and eighty grenadiers and light infantry, who were immediately led into action. The Americans now fled on all &s;ides. Gen. St. Clair heard when the firing began, and would have &s;upported Warner, but the troops that were neare&s;t, two militia regi|ments, would not obey orders, and the others were at too great a di&s;tance. Hale, who had attempted to get off by flight, fell in with an incon&s;iderable party of Briti&s;h, and &s;urren|dered him&s;elf and a number of his men pri|&s;oners. The Americans lo&s;t 324 in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, and among the la&s;t were 12 officers. The royal troops, includ|ing Briti&s;h and German, had not le&s;s than 183 killed and wounded.</P>

<P>Let us now return to &s;ee what was doing by Gen. Howe. The Briti&s;h fleet and army which lay at Sandy Hook, were de&s;tined for the reduction of Philadelphia, in pur&s;uance of a plan which had been &s;ettted between Sir William Howe and Lord George Germain, but did not &s;ail 'till the 23d of July. The
<PB N="114" REF="025347_0115_0FCCFFAE896CC7E0">land forces con&s;i&s;ted of thirty &s;ix Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian battalions, including the light infantry and grenadiers, with a powerful artillery, a New York corps, called Queen's Rangers, and a regiment of light hor&s;e, e&s;timated all together at about 16,000 men. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 267 &s;ail. Gen. Howe's thus abandoning Burgoyne, equally excited the a&s;toni&s;hment of friends and enemies.</P>
<P>On the 14th of June the congre&s;s re&s;olved that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen &s;tripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen &s;tars, white in a blue field, repre&s;enting a new con&s;tellation.</P>
<P>It was not till the third of September that the royal army began to move forwards. On its advancing near to the Americans, the&s;e abandoned their ground, perceiving that it would not an&s;wer their fir&s;t expectation. They cro&s;&s;ed Brandywine at Chad's ford, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, with an evident intention of di&s;puting the pa&s;&s;age of the river; but the &s;uperior numbers of the regular forces at la&s;t obliged them to retire.</P>
<P>A little after &s;unri&s;e on the 11th of Sep|tember, a warm engagement commenced, which la&s;ted till the approach of night. On this occa&s;ion, the Americans &s;hewed great re&s;olution and courage; but a few hours more of day light might have &s;o animated the conquering reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lars, &s;atigued as they were,
<PB N="115" REF="025347_0116_0FCCFFAFBB54E760">as to have produced, tho&s;e exertions, which would have been productive of a total and ruinous defeat to the Americans. It was &s;aid by the Americans them&s;elves, that in this action, their lo&s;s in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, was about twelve or thirteen hun|dred; and that the royal army did not &s;uffer, on their part, &s;hort of &s;even or eight hundred, in killed and wounded. The Americans al&s;o lo&s;t ten &s;mall field pieces, and a howitzer, of which all but one were bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The evening after the battle, a party of regulars was &s;ent to Wilmington, who took the governor of the Delaware &s;tate, Mr. M'Kenley, out of his bed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a &s;hallop lying in the creek, loaded with the rich effects of &s;ome of the inhabitants, together with the public records of the county, and a large quantity of public and private money, be&s;ides articles of plate, and other things.</P>
<P>After various motions of the regular army, on the 26th of September General Howe made his triumphal entry into Philadelphia, with a &s;mall part of his army, where he was mo&s;t cordially received by the generality of the quakers, and a few other royali&s;ts. The bulk of his troops were left in and about German town, a village forming one conti|nued &s;treet for near two miles. Gen. Wa&s;h|ington's army was encamped near Shippach-creek about eighteen miles from thence.

<P>To return to the northern army, under the command of Gen. Burgoyne. Several actions took place, between the Americans and regulars, in the intended march of the Briti&s;h towards Albany. In the&s;e different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">irmi&s;hes, the regulars &s;uffered very con&s;i|derably, as well as the indians in their in|tere&s;t.

<PB N="117" REF="025347_0118_0FCCFFB2E2FE2528">parents, with their &s;ix children, were all &s;calped and treated with the &s;ame inhuman|ity, while quietly re&s;iding in their once happy and peaceful dwellings. The mi&s;er|able fate of Mi&s;s M'Rea was particularly ag|gravated, by her being dre&s;&s;ed to receive her promi&s;ed hu&s;band, when &s;he met her murderer employed by you. Upwards of one hundred men, women, and children, have peri&s;hed by the hands of the ruffians, to whom it is a&s;&s;erted, you have paid the price of blood." Gen. Burgoyne, in his reply of the 6th of the &s;ame month, vindi|cated his own character; &s;hewed that Mi&s;s M'Rea's death was no premeditated barbar|ity, and declared, that every other charge, exhibited by Gen. Gates, was ill founded and erroneous.</P>
<P>The murder of Mi&s;s M'Rea exa&s;perated the Americans, and from that and other cru|elties occa&s;ion was taken to blacken the royal party and army. The people dete&s;ted that army which accepted of &s;uch Indian aid, and loudly reprobated that government which could call in &s;uch auxiliaries. Gen. Gates was not deficient in aggravating, by &s;everal publications, the exce&s;&s;es that had taken place, and with no &s;mall advantage to his own mil|itary operations.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September, Gen. Bur|goyne, having been very &s;hort of provi&s;ions, at length received a &s;upply for about thirty
<PB N="118" REF="025347_0119_0FCCFFB4D46E8B88">days, together with other nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores He then re&s;olved upon pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's river with the army, which having executed, he encamped on the heights and on the plains of Saratoga. The Americans, ob&s;erving the motions of the royal army, marched out 3000 &s;trong, in order to attack him, but &s;ound that to be prudentially impracticable. However, they drew up in full view of him, and there remained till dark.</P>
<P>The next day &s;ome of the American &s;cout|ing parties fell in with tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h, and with great boldne&s;s began the attack about one o'clock at noon. The firing was no &s;ooner heard by Gen. Phillips, than he made his way with a part of the artillery, through the woods, and rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices. Each commander &s;upported, re+inforced, and ordered different regiments to engage. The battle was hot and ob&s;tinate on both &s;ides, till about half pa&s;t two o'clock, when it cea&s;ed for half an hour. The Amer|ican and Briti&s;h lines being fully formed, the action was renewed, and became general at three. Both armies appeared determined to conquer or die, and there was one continual blaze of fire for three hours without intermi&s;|&s;ion; the report of the mu&s;kets re&s;embled an ince&s;&s;ant roll beating on a number of drums.&mdash;The Americans and Briti&s;h alternate|ly drove and were driven by each other.&mdash;Three Briti&s;h regiments, the 20th, the 21&s;t,
<PB N="119" REF="025347_0120_0FCCFFB5C1DD1CA0">and the 62d, were in a con&s;tant and clo&s;e fire for near four hours. All &s;uffered con&s;ider|able lo&s;s: the 62d, which was 500 &s;trong when it left Canada, was now reduced to le&s;s than 60 men, and to four or five officers. Few ac|tions have been characteri&s;ed, by more ob&s;ti|nacy in attack or defence, than was the pre|&s;ent. Both parties claimed the victory, though neither had much advantage to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>From this time till near the middle of Oc|tober, battles and &s;kirmi&s;hes continually took place between the two armies, and the Briti&s;h were &s;adly reduced and weakened. On the 13th Gen. Burgoyne, finding that the troops had only three days provi&s;ions, in &s;tore, on &s;hort allowance, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, called into council all the generals, field officers, and captains com|manding troops. There was not a &s;pot of ground in the whole camp for holding the council of war, but what was expo&s;ed to can|non or rifle &s;hot; and while the council was deliberating, an eighteen-pound ball cro&s;&s;ed the table. By the unanimous advice of the council, the general was induced to open a treaty with Gen. Gates. The fir&s;t propo|&s;als of the latter were rejected, and the &s;ixth article with di&s;dain, wherein it was required, that the Briti&s;h army &s;hould lay down their arms in their entrenchments. Burgoyne's counter-propo&s;als were unanimou&s;ly ap|proved, and being &s;ent to Gates were
<PB N="120" REF="025347_0121_0FCCFFB7397E79B0">agreed to, on the 15th, without any material alteration.</P>
<P>Gen. Gates being fearful of the con&s;e|quences that might follow, &s;hould Gen. Vaughan with his troops come up in time to Burgoyne's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, determined upon bring|ing the matter to an immediate i&s;&s;ue. On the morning of the 17th, he got every thing in readine&s;s for attacking the royal army. This done he took out his watch, the time agreed for &s;igning being come. He then &s;ent Col. Greaton on hor&s;eback to Burgoyne with a me&s;&s;age, requiring the general to &s;ign, and allowed him no more than ten minutes to go and return. He was back in time, the treaty was &s;igned, all ho&s;tile appearances cea&s;ed, and the Americans marched into the Briti&s;h lines to the tune of Yankee Doodle. They were kept there until the royal army had marched out of their lines, and depo&s;ited their arms at the place appointed by the treaty.</P>
<P>The delicacy with which this bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted reflects the highe&s;t honor upon the American general. It intimated that he was &s;en&s;ible of the mortification attending a rever&s;e of fortune, and that he was unwil|ling to aggravate the painful feelings of the royal troops, by admitting the American &s;oldiers to be eye witne&s;&s;es to the degrading &s;pectacle of piling their arms. When the arms were depo&s;ited agreeable to treaty, the
<PB N="121" REF="025347_0122_0FCCFFB959202CB8" MS="y">royal troops were &s;erved with bread by the Americans, as they had not any left, nor flour to make it. They had only one day's &s;alt meat remaining.</P>
<P>The treaty was &s;tiled, "A convention between Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne and Major Gen. Gates." Among other articles it was &s;tipulated, "That the troops under Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne &s;hall march out of their camp with the honors of war, and the artillery of the entrenchments, to the verge of the river. where the arms and artillery are to be left.&mdash;The arms to be piled by word of command from their own officers. A free pa&s;&s;age to be granted to the royal army to Great Bri|tain, upon condition of not &s;erving again in North America during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t; and the port of Bo&s;ton to be a&s;&s;igned for the entry of tran&s;ports to receive the troops, whenever Gen. Howe &s;hall &s;o order.&mdash;The officers baggage not to be mole&s;ted or &s;earch|ed.&mdash;During the &s;tay of the troops in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, the officers are to be ad|mited on parole, and be allowed to wear their &s;ide-arms."</P>
<P>The return &s;igned by Gen. Burgoyne, at the time of the convention, made the Briti&s;h army, including Germans, amount to 5791, which was very &s;hort of the number they had on &s;etting out from Canada. The train of bra&s;s arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, con&s;i&s;ting of 42 pieces, was a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne acqui&s;ition to the Americans.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the end of October, 1777, the royal army, under the command of Sir William Howe, removed to Philadelphia. Mea&s;ures being concerted between the gene|ral and admiral for clearing the Delaware of its ob&s;tructions, the former ordered batteries to be erected on the we&s;tern or Penn&s;ylvanian &s;hore, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;lodging the Americans from Mud i&s;land. He al&s;o detached a &s;trong body of He&s;&s;ians cro&s;s the river, who were to reduce the fort at Red-bank while the &s;hips and batteries on the other &s;ide were to attack Mud-I&s;land. Count D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nop, in the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h, was intru&s;ted with the expedition again&s;t Red-bank, but he failed in the attempt. He was mortally wounded and taken pri&s;oner, &s;everal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s be&s;t officers were killed or di&s;abled, and the He&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, after a de&s;perate engagement, were
<PB N="124" REF="025347_0125_0FCCFFBEC3065A60">repul&s;ed. The &s;econd in command being al&s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded, the detachment was brought off by Lieut. Col. Lin&s;ing. It is &s;aid that the royal detachment lo&s;t, on this occa&s;ion, between four and five hundred men.</P>
<P>The expedition again&s;t Mud I&s;land met with better &s;ucce&s;s, the Americans being drive from thence, and forced to retire to Red bank.</P>
<P>On the night of the 18th of November, Lord Cornwallis marched with a con&s;iderable force, and the next day cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, in his way to Red bank, which the Ameri|cans abandoned, leaving behind them the ar|tillery, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;iderable quantity of cannon ball. The Engli&s;h generals confe&s;&s;ed, that the long and unexpected oppo&s;ition they received from Red-bank and Mud I&s;land, broke in upon their plans for the remainder of the campaign.</P>
<P>On the third of May, 1778, Mr. Simeon Deane arrived in America expre&s;s from France, with very important di&s;patches.&mdash;The The congre&s;s was immediately convened, and the di&s;patches opened and read, among which, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, were a trea|ty of commerce and a treaty of alliance, concluded between his mo&s;t chri&s;tian ma|je&s;ty the king of France and the United States of America. The treaties were duly weighed and con&s;idered &s;eperately the next
<PB N="125" REF="025347_0126_0FCCFFC041D41038" MS="y">day, and upon each it was unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved, "That the &s;ame be, and is hereby accepted" The next re&s;olution was, "That this congre&s;s entertain the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the magnanimity and wi&s;dom of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, &s;o &s;trongly exem|plified in the treaty of amity and commerce; and the commi&s;&s;ioners repre&s;enting their &s;tates, at the court of France, are directed to pre&s;ent the grateful acknowledgments of this congre&s;s to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, for his truly magnanimous conduct re&s;pect|ing the&s;e &s;tates, in the &s;aid generous and di&s;intere&s;ted treaties, and to a&s;&s;ure his ma|je&s;ty, on the part of this congre&s;s, it is &s;in|cerely wi&s;hed, that the friend&s;hip, &s;o happily commenced between France and the&s;e United States may be perpetual."</P>
<P>The congre&s;s, after receiving the treaties, had a &s;tronger feeling of their own import|ance than before, and re&s;olved, "That the cummi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oners appointed for the courts of Spain, Tu&s;cany, Vienna, and Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;hould live in &s;uch &s;tile and manner at their re&s;pec|tive courts, as they may find &s;uitable and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the dignity of their public character."</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of May, they agreed to a draught of "An addre&s;s to the inhabitants of the United States of America." In this publication, when they come to the French treaty, they &s;ay, "You have &s;till to expect

It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the de&s;troyer. They have filled up the mea&s;ure of their abominations, and like ripe fruit mu&s;t &s;oon drop from the tree. Al|though much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, while any corner of America is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your foes. You mu&s;t drive them away from this land of Pro|mi&s;e, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the continent already implore your friend&s;hip and protection. It is your duty to grant their reque&s;t. They hunger and thrift after liberty. Be it yours to di&s;pen&s;e to them the heavenly gift. And what is there now to prevent it?"</P>
<P>In the month of May the American fri|gate, Randolph of 36 guns, and 305 men, &s;ailed on a crui&s;e from Charle&s;town.

The captain humanely &s;u&s;pended the chace, hauled up to the wreck, got a boat out and brought them on board.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May the &s;econd battalion of Briti&s;h light infantry, in Flat boats, at|tended by three gallies and other armed boats, proceeded up the Delaware, in order to de&s;troy all the American &s;hip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and ve&s;&s;els l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the river between Philadelphia and Trenton.

<P>Gen Howe was &s;ucceeded in the com|mand of the army by Sit Henry Clinton, who arrived at Philadelphia on the eighth of May.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth of February the treaties be|tween France and the United States were &s;igned. The alliance batween the&s;e two powers was known to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;oon after they were &s;igned. Mr. Fox, in a debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons five days afterwards, a&s;&s;erted, that the number of men lo&s;t to the army, in killed, di&s;abled, de&s;erted, and from various other cau&s;es, from the com|mencement of ho&s;lilities with America to that period, amounted to above twenty thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>On the 17th Lord North introduced his conciliatory propo&s;itions. His plan was to enable the crown to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the colonies concerning the means of putting a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> end to tho&s;e unhappy conte&s;ts; for which five per&s;ons were inve&s;t|ed with ample powers. His Lord&s;hip &s;aid in his &s;peech, that Gen. Howe had been in the late actions, and in the whole cour&s;e of the campaign, not only in the goodne&s;s of troops, and in all manner of &s;upplies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o in
<PB N="129" REF="025347_0131_0FCCFFCAC205EDD8">point of numbers, much &s;uperior to the American army that oppo&s;ed him in the field; that Gen. Burgoyne had been in num|bers, until the affair at Bennington, nearly twice as &s;trong as the army of the enemy; that he promi&s;ed a great army &s;hould be &s;ent out, and that a great army had accordingly been &s;ent out, to the amount of 60,000 men and upwards.</P>
<P>The &s;peech was long, able, and eloquent, and kept him up two full hours. A dull melancholy &s;ilence for &s;ome time &s;ucceeded. It was heard with profound attention, but without a &s;ingle mark of approbation. A&s;ton|i&s;hment, dejection, and fear, over-clouded the whole a&s;&s;embly. It was conjectured, that &s;ome powerful motive had induced mini&s;try to adopt &s;uch an alteration of mea&s;ures. This idea was confirmed by the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. Fox, that a treaty had been &s;igned at Paris between the colonies and France, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich &s;he recognized her independence.</P>
<P>On the 13th of March, the French am|ba&s;&s;ador delivered a re&s;cript to Lord Wey|mouth, in which he informed the court of London, that the king had &s;igned a treaty of friend&s;hip and commerce with the United States of America. The knowledge of this tran&s;action was communicated under the par|ade of cultivating the good under&s;tanding between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="025347_0132_0FCCFFCCF920F830">
On the 21&s;t of March, a public audience and reception were given to the American commi&s;&s;ioners, Me&s;&s;. Franklin, Deane, and Lee, by the French monarch. They were introduced by Mon&s;. Vergennes, and receiv|ed by the king with the u&s;ual formalities and ceremonies. The &s;triking acknowledg|ment of the plenipotentiaries from the United States mortified the mini&s;try and crown of Great Britain, and may be pronounced the political phenomenon of Europe.

<P>From this time, the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles were bu&s;ied in fitting out their fleets, which met each other in the month of July. The Engli&s;h fleet was commanded by the Admirals Keppel, Pallier, and Har|land.

<P>In the beginning of June, the Trident Briti&s;h man of war arrived in the Delaware, with the Earl of Carli&s;le, Mr. Eden and Gov. John&s;tone, three of the commi&s;&s;ioners for re&s;toring peace between Great Britain and America.</P>

<P>When intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having evacuated Philadelphia reached the American head-quarters. Gen. Wa&s;hington took his mea&s;ures accordingly. Several &s;kir|mi&s;hes happened between the Americans and the regulars with various &s;ucce&s;s, till on the goth of June the royal army arrived in the neighborhood of Sandy Hook. During the cour&s;e of the march from Philadelphia, the royal army was much reduced, upwards of 800 having de&s;erted, a great number of whom were He&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>On the 5th of July, the army pa&s;&s;ed over a bridge of boats cro&s;s a narrow channel to Sandy Hook, and were afterwards carried up to Newyork. On the 7th Lord Howe re|ceived advice, that the &s;quadrom from Tou|lon was arrived at Virginia. Count d'E&s;taing anchored on the 8th at night at the entrance of the Delaware. The next morning he weighed and &s;ailed towards the Hook, and on the evening of the 11th anchored without it. Had not bad weather and unexpected im|pedimen's prevented, the Count mu&s;t have &s;urpri&s;ed Howe's fleet in the Delaware, as the latter would not have had time to e&s;cape
<PB N="132" REF="025347_0134_0FCCFFD0C5DABFB0">after being appri&s;ed of his danger. The de|&s;truction of the fleet mu&s;t have been the con|&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;al, and that mu&s;t have acca&s;ioned the inevitable lo&s;s of the royal army, which would have been &s;o en|clo&s;ed by the French &s;quadron on the one &s;ide, and the American forces on the other, that the Saratoga cata&s;trophe mu&s;t have been repeated. Lord Howe's fleet con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix &s;ixty four gun &s;hips, three of fifty, and two of forty, with &s;ome frigates and &s;loops. Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d E&s;taing had twelve &s;hips of the line, &s;ome of which were of great force and weight.</P>
<P>On the and of July, the count &s;ailed from Sandy Hook, when about twenty &s;ail of ve&s;|&s;els bound to New York fell into his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. They were chiefly prizes taken from the Americans; but had he &s;tayed a few days longer, Admiral Byron's fleet mu&s;t have fallen a defencele&s;s prey into their hands. That &s;quadron had met with unu&s;ual bad weather, and being &s;eperated in different &s;torms, and lingering through a tedious pa&s;|&s;age, arrived &s;cattered, broken, &s;ickly, di&s;|ma&s;ted, or otherwi&s;e damaged in various de|grees of di&s;tre&s;s, upon different and remote parts of the American coa&s;t. Between the departure of d'E&s;taing and the 30th of July, the Renown of 50 guns from the We&s;t-In|dies, the Rai&s;onable and Centurion of 64, and the Cornwall of 74 guns, all arrived
<PB N="133" REF="025347_0135_0FCCFFD3082DBC18">&s;ingly at Sandy Hook. By d'E&s;taing's &s;peedy departure a number of provi&s;ion &s;hips from Cork e&s;caped al&s;o, together with their con|voy. They went up the Delaware within fifty miles of Philadelphia after Lord Howe had quitted the river, not having obtained any information of what had happened. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try had neglected countermand|ing their de&s;tination, though orders for the evacuation of Philadelphia had been &s;ent off &s;o early, as to have admitted of their receiv|ind fre&s;h in&s;tructions where to have &s;teered before &s;ailing. Great rejoicings were made at New York upon their &s;afe arrival, e&s;peci|ally as provi&s;ions were much wanted both by the fleet and army.</P>
<P>Let us now quit the military operations for the pre&s;ent and take a view of the pending negociations. Gov. John&s;tone, meaning to avail him&s;elf of former connections, endea|voured to commence or renew a private cor|re&s;pondence with &s;everal members of con|gre&s;s, and other per&s;ons of con&s;ideration. In his letter to them he u&s;ed a freedom with the authority under which he acted, not cu&s;|tomary with tho&s;e entru&s;ted with delegated power, and afforded &s;uch a degree of appro|bation to the Americans in the pa&s;t re&s;i&s;tance they had made, as is &s;eldom granted by ne|gociators to their opponents. In a letter to Jo&s;eph Reed, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of April 11th, he &s;aid "The man, who can be in&s;tumental in

<P>On the 16th of June, he wrote to Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> "I believe the men, who have conducted the affairs of America, in|capable of being influenced by improper mo|tives; but in all &s;uch tran&s;actions there is ri&s;k, and I think that whoever ventures &s;hould be &s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed; at the &s;ame time that honor and emo|lument &s;hould naturally follow the fortune of tho&s;e, who have &s;teered &s;he ve&s;&s;el in the &s;torm, and brought her &s;afety to port. I think that Wa&s;hington and the pre&s;ident have a right to every favour that a grateful nation can be&s;tow, if they could once more unite our intere&s;t, and &s;pare the mi&s;eries and de|va&s;tations of war."</P>
<P>On Sunday the 21&s;t of June, Mr. Reed received a written me&s;&s;age from Mrs Fer|gu&s;on, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee him on bu|&s;ine&s;s, which could not be committed to writing. On his attending in the evening, agreeable to her appointment, after &s;ome pre|vious conver&s;ation, &s;he enlarged upon the great talents and amiable qualities of Gov. John&s;tone, and added, that in &s;everal conver|&s;ations
<PB N="135" REF="025347_0137_0FCCFFD5FAB29898">with her, he had expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t favorable &s;entiments of Mr. Reed; that it was particularly wi&s;hed to engage his in|tere&s;t to promote the object of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, viz. a re-union of the two countries, if con&s;i&s;tent with his principles and judgment; and that in &s;uch ca&s;e it could not be deemed unbecoming or improper in the Briti&s;h government to take a favorable notice of &s;uch conduct; and that, in this in|&s;tance, Mr. Reed might have ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and any office in the colonies in his maje&s;ty's gift.</P>
<P>Mr. Reed, finding an an&s;wer was expect|ed, replied, "I am not worth purcha&s;ing; but &s;uch as I am, the king of Great Britain is not rich enough to do it." However right, the principles might be, on which this in&s;i|nuating &s;cheme of conciliation was adopted, its effects were inimical.</P>
<P>On the 9th of July, congre&s;s ordered, "That all letters received by members of congre&s;s from any of the Briti&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners, or their agents, or from any &s;ubject of the king of Great Britain, of a public nature, be laid before congre&s;s" The pre|ceding letters, being communicated, and Mr. Reed making a declaration of what had pa&s;&s;ed within his knowledge, congre&s;s re&s;olved, "That the &s;ame cannot be con&s;idered but as direct attempts to corrupt and bribe the con|gre&s;s; that as congre&s;s feel, &s;o they ought to

<P>The proceedings in this bu&s;ine&s;s were ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the form of a declaration, a copy of which was ordered to be &s;igned by the pre&s;ident, and &s;ent by a flag to the commi&s;|&s;ioners at Newyork.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings produced a very angry and violent declaration from Gov. John&s;tone, in which the immediate operations of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;appointment were too con&s;picious. The language of his publication but poorly agreed with the high and flatter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng compli|ments he had &s;o lately lavi&s;hed on the Ame|ricans in tho&s;e very letters, which were the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. It was dated the 26th of Augu&s;t, and tran&s;mitted to con|gre&s;s; together with a declaration of the &s;ame date from Lord Carli&s;le. Sir Henry Clinton, and Mr. Eden, which went to a &s;olemn and total di&s;avowel, &s;o far as related to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, of their having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny knowledge, directly or indirectly, of the&s;e matters &s;pecified by congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="025347_0139_0FCCFFD9CF326D38">
Thus were all hopes of further negocia|tion with congre&s;s at an end. Had Lord North, and the re&s;t of the mini&s;try then in being, adopted the&s;e corrupting mea&s;ures in the more early part of the Amrican di&s;putes, it is po&s;&s;ible he might have &s;ucceeded; but to attempt it at a time when the &s;pirits of the Americans were rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch by their new alliance with France, was &s;urely little &s;hort of folly and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 6th of Augu&s;t, the Hon. Sieur Gerard was introduced to the congre&s;s, in quality of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, who pro|duced a letter from his ma&s;ter the king of France to <HI>his very dear great friends and allies;</HI> and the compliments Mon&s;. Gerard received on this occa&s;ion, were very different from tho&s;e &s;entiments the Americans lately enter|tained of their <HI>now</HI> faithful allies!</P>
<P>On the 14th of September, congre&s;s pro|ceeded to the election of a mini&s;ter plenipo|tentiary to the court of France, when Dr. Benjamin Franklin was elected by ballot. His in&s;tructions were dated the 26th of Oc|tober, and by them he was directed to ob|tain, if po&s;&s;ible, the French king's con&s;ent to expunge two of the articles of the treaty of commerce. The doctor was to inculcate the certainty of ruining the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery on the banks of Newfoundland, and con&s;e|quently the Briti&s;h marine, by reducing Hal|ifax and Quebec.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE campaign in the northern &s;tates hav|ing produced nothing advantageous to the Briti&s;h, and the winter being the proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;outhern expeditions, Sir Henry Clinton concluded upon turning his arms again&s;t Georgia. He might propo&s;e to him|&s;elf the reduction of all the &s;outhern &s;tates, and he &s;trongly inclined to it, by rea&s;on that the&s;e &s;tates produced the mo&s;t valuable articles of commerce for the European market, and carried on a con&s;iderable export trade, which appeared no otherwi&s;e affected by the war, than as it &s;uffered from the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers. The rice was devoted to the &s;er|vice of its enemies, while it was wanted for the &s;upport of the royal &s;leet and army in America. A plan of operations was con|certed with Gen. Prevo&s;t, who commanded in Ea&s;t Florida; and it was intended, that Georgia &s;hould be invaded both on the north and &s;outh &s;ides at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This expedition was committed to Col. Campbell, and the forces appointed to act under him amounted to full 2500, which &s;ailed from Sandy Hook, on the 27th of November, being e&s;corted by a &s;mall &s;quadron under Commodore Hyde Parker. The fleet arrived at the i&s;le of Tibee, near the mouth of the
<PB N="140" REF="025347_0142_0FCCFFDE44E03310">Savannah, and on the 29th of December, the troops effected a landing. They were no &s;ooner landed, than they were led to attack the fort, which the Briti&s;h per&s;i&s;ted in with &s;o much &s;pirit and rapidity, that the Ameri|cans retreated with precipitation and di&s;order. No victory was ever more complete: thirty-eight officers, and 415 non-commi&s;&s;ioned and privates, 48 pieces of cannon, 23 mortars, the fort with its ammunition and &s;tores, the &s;hipping in the river, a large quantity of pro|vi&s;ions, with the capital of Georgia, were all within the &s;pace of a few hours, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h troops.</P>
<P>The 30th of December was appointed as a thank&s;giving-day, by order of congre&s;s. The affairs of the United States were at this period in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, deplorable, and ruinous condition. Idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, and extravagance, &s;eemed to have engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the generality of the American &s;ons of liberty; and &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;peculation, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for riches a peared to have got the better of every other con&s;idera|tion, and almo&s;t of every order of men. Party di&s;putes and per&s;onal quarrels were too much the general object, while the moment|ous concerns of the empire, a va&s;t accumu|lated debt, ruined finances, depreciated mon|ey, and want of credit, which naturally brings on the want of every thing, were but &s;econdary con&s;iderations, and po&s;tponed by
<PB N="141" REF="025347_0143_0FCCFFDFC6A92788">congre&s;s from time to time, as if their affairs were in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;ituation. The paper currency in Philadelphia was daily &s;ink|ing, and at length even &s;o low as fifty per cent, yet an a&s;&s;embly, a concert, a dinner, or &s;upper, which co&s;t two or three hundred pounds, did not only take men off from act|ing, but even from thinking of what ought to have been neare&s;t their hearts. Some of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted and patriotic Ameri|cans felt more di&s;tre&s;s from this review of things, than they had done at any other time, from the di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es in the cour&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mons. Gerard, the French amba&s;&s;ador, manife&s;ted a de&s;ire, that the war might not be prolonged by too high and unrea&s;onable demands, and that the United States would reduce their ultimatum as low as po&s;&s;ible. He &s;trongly recommend|ed moderation, as the fate of war was uncer|tain; and he hinted, that a deci&s;ive naval engagement in favour of the Briti&s;h, might give a great turn to their affairs.</P>
<P>The South-Carolina delegates, rather with a view to conque&s;t, than from any &s;pecial apprehen&s;ion of danger to their own or neighbouring &s;tates, from the troops under Gen. Clinton, reque&s;ted the Congre&s;s to ap|point Gen. Lincoln on who&s;e character they ju&s;tly repo&s;ed great confidence, to the com|mand of all the forces to the &s;outhward. Ac|cordingly
<PB N="142" REF="025347_0144_0FCCFFE145B5E618" MS="y">they made the appointment on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5th of September, and ordered him imme|diately to repair to Charle&s;town.</P>
<P>On the 2d of March, the American offi|cer of the day reported, that reconno t|ring parties of the enemy's hor&s;e and foot had been &s;een within their piquet the night pre|ceding. Gen. A&s;he, who had cro&s;&s;ed the Savannah, with about 1200 troops, be&s;ides 200 light hor&s;e, returned on the evening of the &s;ame day to his camp. In &s;hort, the conduct of Gen. A&s;he was &s;o pu&s;illanimous, that he made no preparations to impede the march of the Briti&s;h, and, &s;oon after their appearance, he and his troops fled with pre|cipitation, without firing a gun.</P>
<P>In the month of May Sir Henry Clinton di&s;patched Sir George Collier and Gen. Mat|thews, with about 2000 men, be&s;ides 500 marines, to make a de&s;cent upon Virginia. They &s;ailed for Port&s;mooth in that Province, and upon their arrival landed their troops at a di&s;tance, then marched and took immedi|ate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, which was de|&s;encele&s;s. The remains of Norfolk, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, fell of cour&s;e into their hands. On the approach of the fleet and army, the Americans burnt &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els, others were &s;aved and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h. The guards were pu&s;hed forwards eighteen miles by night to Suffolk, where they arrived by day light and proceeded to
<PB N="143" REF="025347_0145_0FCCFFE2DA726A90">de&s;troy a magazine of provi&s;ions, together with the ve&s;&s;els and naval &s;tores found there. A &s;imilar de&s;truction was carried on at other places in that quarter, nor were the frigates and armed ve&s;&s;els le&s;s active or &s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Within the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">night that the fleet and army continued upon the coa&s;t, the lo&s;s of the Americans was prodigious. Above 130 ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts, including &s;ome privateers, and &s;hips of force, were de&s;troyed or taken by them; &s;eventeen prizes were brought away, be&s;ides 3000 hog&s;heads of tobacco, which fell into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at Port&s;mouth. Except the hou&s;e of a widow and the church, they burnt every hou&s;e in Suffolk, and all the principal hou&s;es of gentlemen in this route &s;hared the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>On the 30th of May, the troops were joined to others going up the North river to attack the po&s;ts of Stoney Point and Ver|plank, where the Americans had begun to con&s;truct &s;trong works, for keeping the lower communication open between the ea&s;t|ern and &s;outhern &s;tates. Gen. Vaughan landed with the greater part on the ea&s;t-&s;ide, while the remainder, accompanied by Sir Henry Clinton, advanced further up, landed on the we&s;t &s;ide, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Stoney Point without oppo&s;ition. Directly oppo&s;ite, the Americans had completely fin|i&s;hed a &s;trong &s;ort, which was defended by

The gari&s;on, finding them&s;elves totally overpowered, &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;on|ers of war. By the lo&s;s of the&s;e po&s;ts, the Jer&s;ey people were obliged to make a circuit of about ninety miles under the mountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> communicate with the &s;tates c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of Hud|&s;on's river.</P>
<P>After the French had taken Grenada, and Count d'E&s;taing was lying with his fleet at Cape Francos, he received letters from Gov. Rutledge, Gen. Lincoln, the French con&s;ul at Charle&s;town, and others, urging him to vi&s;it the Amercan coa&s;t, and propo&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng an attack upon Savannah. The general engaged to join him with a thou&s;and men certain, and promi&s;ed that every exertion &s;hould be made to increa&s;e the number. The application coinciding with the king's in|&s;tructions, to act in concert with the forces of the United States, whenever an occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf, he &s;ailed for the American continent within a few days after it was re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="025347_0147_0FCCFFE8C16C3E18">
On the 1&s;t of September, Count d'E&s;taing arrived with a fleet of twenty &s;ail of the line, two of fifty guns, and eleven frigates. The appearance of the French fleet on the coa&s;ts of South Carolina and Georgia was &s;o un|expected by the Briti&s;h that the Experiment man of war. of fifty guns, Sir James Wal|lace, commander, and three friga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, were captured. No &s;ooner was it known at Charle&s;town, that the Count was on the coa&s;t, than Lincoln marched with all expedition for Savannah, with the troops under his com|mand; and orders were al&s;o given for the South, Caro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">na and Georgia militia to ren|dezvous immediately near the &s;ame place.&mdash;The Briti&s;h were equally diligent in pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">paring for their defence.</P>
<P>The French and Americans, after having &s;pent &s;ome time in making regular approaches at la&s;t determined to take the place by &s;torm. Accordingly the morning of the 9th of Oc|tober was fixed for the attack, and neither the French nor the Americans had the lea&s;t doubts of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Two feints were made with the country militia, and a real attack a little before day|light, on the Spring-hill battery, with 3500 French troops, 600 continentals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od 350 of the Charle&s;town militia, headed by Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'E&s;taing and Gen.

A general retreat of the a&s;&s;ailants took place, after they had &s;tood the enemy's fire for fifty five minutes.

Of the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 Charle&s;town militia who were in the hote&s;t of the fire, only &s;ix were wound|ed, and a captain killed. Gen.

There were not ten guns mounted on the lines when the enemy fir&s;t appeared, and in a few days the number exceeded eighty. The garri&s;on was between two and three thou&s;and, includ|ing 150 militia. The damage it &s;u&s;tained was trifling as the men fired under cover, and few of the a&s;&s;ailants fired at all.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what the northern army was doing. In the middle of December, a part of Gen. Wa&s;hington's army was with|out bread and for the re&s;t he had not, either on the &s;pot or within reach, a &s;upply &s;ufficient for foor days. Both officers and men were almo&s;t peri&s;hing through want for a fortnight.
<PB N="147" REF="025347_0149_0FCCFFED4F15B990">The deficiency proceeded from the ab&s;olute emptine&s;s of the American magazines in every place, and the total want of money and credit to repleni&s;h them. So that the general was obliged to call upon the magi&s;|trates of the Jer&s;ey &s;tate, to expre&s;s his &s;itua|tion to them, and to declare in plain terms, that he and his army were reduced to the al|ternative of di&s;banding or catering for them|&s;elves, unle&s;s the inhabitants would afford them aid. He alloted to each county a cer|tain proportion of flour or grain, and a cer|tain number of cattle to be delivered on cer|tain days. To the honor of the magi&s;trates, and the good di&s;po&s;itions of the people, be it added, that the&s;e requi&s;itions were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ally complied with, and in many c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nties ex|ceeded.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nern armies. On the 20th of March, 1780, Admiral Arbuth|not, with a &s;mall fleet cro&s;&s;ed the bar, in front of rebellion road, and anchored in Five Fathom Hole. The American fleet re|treated to Charle&s;town, and the crews and guns of all the ve&s;&s;els, except the Ranger, were put on &s;hore to reinforce the batteries. Before the Americans had taken this &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, they &s;hould have con&s;idered, whether the &s;hips were able to defend the bar, and &s;hould have &s;ent them off, when they found it im|practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="025347_0150_0FCCFFEEBA6BC7B0">
On the 12th of April, the Briti&s;h opened their batteries again&s;t Charle&s;town, and a con&s;tant fire was kept up between both par|ties until the 20th. On the 18th of April, Sir Henry Clinton received a reinforcement of 3000 men from New York; and on the 12th of May, Gen. Lincoln, after having made the mo&s;t vigorous defence he was ca|pable of, was obliged to capitulate. It was &s;tipulated, that the continental troops and &s;ailors &s;hould remain pri&s;oners of war until exchanged, and be provided with good and whole&s;ome provi&s;ions, in &s;uch quantities as were &s;erved out to the Briti&s;h troops. The militia were to return home as pri&s;oners on parole, which, as long as they ob&s;erved, was to &s;ecure them from being mole&s;ted in their property by the Briti&s;h troops. The officers of the army and navy were to keep their &s;words, pi&s;tols, and baggage, which la&s;t was not to be &s;earched; but their hor&s;es were not to go out of town, but might be di&s;po&s;ed of by a per&s;on left for the purpo&s;e. The gar|ri&s;on, at an hour appointed, was to march out of the town to the ground between the works of the place and the canal, where they were to depo&s;it their arms. The drums were not to beat a Briti&s;h march, nor the colours to be unca&s;ed. All civil officers and citizens, who had borne arms during the &s;iege, were to be pri&s;oners on parole; and with re&s;pect to their property in the city, they were to have

<P>The capital having &s;urrendered, the next object of the Briti&s;h was to &s;ecure the gene|ral &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants. With this view they po&s;ted garri&s;ons in different parts of the country, and marched a large body of troops over the Santee, towards the extremity of the &s;tate, which borders on the mo&s;t populous parts of North Carolina. This oc|ca&s;ioned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;ome American parties, who had advanced into the upper part of South Carolina, in expectation of relieving Charle&s;town. Among the corps which had co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> forward with that view, there was one con&s;i&s;ting of about 300 conti|nentals, the rear of the Virginia line, com|manded by Col. Buford. Tarleton, with about 700 hor&s;e and foot, was &s;ent in que&s;t of this party. Having mounted his infantry, he marched 105 miles in fifteen hours, came up with them at the Waxhaws, and demand|ed their &s;urrender on terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e granted to the continentals at Charle&s;town. While the flags were pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing on this bu&s;ine&s;s, Tarleton kept his men in motion, and, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruce was ended, had nearly &s;urrounded his adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">aries.

The accidental firing of the few was an argument, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> direct|ing the Briti&s;h legion to charge tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad laid down their arms.

By Tarleton's official accourt of this bloody &s;cene, 113 were killed, 50 badly wounded, unable to travel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d left on pa|role, and 53 made pri&s;oners, while they made &s;uch ineffectual oppo&s;ition as only to kill &s;even and wound twelve of the Briti&s;h. Lord Cornwallis be&s;towed on Tarleton the highe&s;t encomiums for this enterprize, and recommended him in a &s;pecial manner to royal favour and patronage.</P>
<P>The expected &s;uccours at length arrived from France, on the evering of the 10th of July, at Rhode-I&s;land. The Chevalier de Ternay commanded the fleet, which con&s;i&s;t|ed of two &s;hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y guns, one of 74, four of 64. a bomb ve&s;&s;el, and 32 tran&s;ports. The land forces con&s;i&s;ted of four old regi|ments, be&s;ides the legion de Lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un, and a battalion of artillery, amounting to about
<PB N="151" REF="025347_0153_0FCCFFF402C06820">6000 men, under the command of Lieut. Gen. Count de Rochambeau.</P>
<P>About the time that Charle&s;town &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er|ed, Sir H. Clinton received intelligence, that a large number of forces and a French &s;leet, commanded by Mon&s;. Ternay, might &s;oon be expected on the American coa&s;t. This induced him to reimbark for New-York, leaving Lord Cornwallis with about 4000 men, which were deemed fully &s;uffi|cient for his purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>On the 4th of September was &s;igned the plan of a treaty of commerce between the &s;tates of Holland and the United States of America, Mon&s;. de Neufville, being prop|erly authorized by the regency of Am&s;ter|dam, engaged, that as long as America &s;hould not act contrary to the intere&s;t of the &s;tates of Holland, the city of Am&s;terdam would never adopt any mea&s;ure that might tend to oppo&s;e the intere&s;t of America; but would, on the contrary, u&s;e all ts' influence upon the &s;tates of the &s;even United Prov|inces of Holland, to effect the de&s;ired connec|tion. This bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted by Mr. Adams on the part of America.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis went on &s;ucce&s;sfully in South Carolina. On the 16 h of Augu&s;t he engaged the forces under Gen. Gates, and completely routed them after a long and ob&s;tinate conte&s;t. Gen. Gates was borne off the field by a torrent of di&s;mayed militia.
<PB N="152" REF="025347_0154_0FCCFFF586CF54F8">They con&s;tituted &s;o great a part of his army, that when he &s;aw them break and run with &s;uch precepitation, be lo&s;t every hope of vic|tory; and his only care was, if po&s;&s;ible, to rally a &s;ufficient number to cover the retreat of the other troops. He retired with Gen. Ca&s;well to Clermont, in hope of halting them in their late encampment; but the fur|ther they fled, the more they di&s;per&s;ed, and the generals giving up all as lo&s;t, retired with a few attendants to Charlotte.</P>
<P>The Americans lo&s;t eight field pieces, the whole of their artillery, with all their ammu|nition waggons, be&s;ides 150 others, and a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores, and the greate&s;t part of their baggage. The numbers &s;lain cannot be preci&s;ely a&s;certained, no returns of the militia ever being made after the action: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Americans lo&s;t about 700 on this occa&s;ion. Though Cornwallis's victory was complete, yet, from the account the Briti&s;h gave of the action, it may be inferred, that it was dearly bought, upwards of 500 of their own troops being killed or wounded.</P>
<P>A minute repre&s;entation of the retreat of the Americans from Charlotte to Sali&s;bury, would be the image of complicated wretch|edne&s;s. Care, anxiety, pain, humiliation, and dejection, poverty, hurry and confu&s;ion, promi&s;cuou&s;ly marked the &s;hocking &s;cene. Painful objects pre&s;ented them&s;elves to view;
<PB N="153" REF="025347_0155_0FCCFFF6FAFF0318">&s;everal men without an arm, &s;ome with but one, and many &s;tanding in need of the mo&s;t kind and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, nowith&s;tanding his vic|tory, was re&s;trained for &s;ome time from pur|&s;uing his conque&s;ts, by the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;|tained in the battle, the extreme heat of the weather, the &s;ickline&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on and the want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies; he therefore re|mained at Cambden.</P>
<P>In the month of September, a di&s;covery of the utmo&s;t importance was made, which was a &s;cheme for delivering We&s;t Point into the hands of Sir Henry Clint on. Gen. Ar|nold, who had the command of that po&s;t, was brave but mercenary, fond of parade, and extremely de&s;irous of acquiring money to defray the expen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of it. When he en|tered Philadelphia after the evacuation, be made Gov. Penn's, the be&s;t hou&s;e in it, his head quarters. This be furni&s;hed in a very co&s;tly manner, and lived in a &s;tile far beyond his income. He continued his extravagant cour&s;e of living, was un&s;ucce&s;sful in trade and privateering, his funds were exhau&s;ted, and his creditors importunate, while his lu&s;t for high life was not in the lea&s;t abated. He had exhibited heavy accounts and demands again&s;t the public; and the commi&s;&s;ioners, upon examination, rejected about one half of the amount. He appealed to congre&s;s, and a committee was appointed, who were
<PB N="154" REF="025347_0156_0FCCFFF9068B8980" MS="y">of opinion, that the commi&s;&s;ioners had al|lowed more than the general had a right to expect or demand. This provoked him to outrageous expre&s;&s;ions and proceedings. Di&s;|gu&s;ted at the treatment he had met with, embarra&s;&s;ed in his circum&s;tances, and having a growing expen&s;ive family, he turned his thoughts towards bettering his circum&s;tances by new means. In 1779, a corre&s;pondence commenced between Gen. Arnold and Major Andre, adjutant-general to the Briti&s;h army, a ri&s;ing young officer of great hope and merit.</P>
<P>For the &s;peedy completion of the negocia|tion that was carrying on between Sir Henry and Gen. Arnold, the Vulture &s;loop of war was &s;tationed in the North River. at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the American po&s;ts, as, with|out exciting &s;u&s;picion, would &s;erve for the nece&s;&s;ary communication. Before this, a written corre&s;pondence through other chan|nels, had been maintained between Arnold and Andre at New York, under the names of Gu&s;tavus and Ander&s;on. &radic;</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of September, the nece&s;&s;ary arrangenents being made, a boat was &s;ent at night from the &s;hore to the Vulture, to fetch Major Andre, which brought him to the beach without the po&s;ts of either army, where he met Arnold The major continued with him during the day following, and at night, the boatman refu&s;ing to conduct him
<PB N="155" REF="025347_0157_0FCCFFFA76CC0BB0">back to the Vulture, which had &s;hifted her po&s;ition, as &s;he lay expo&s;ed to the fire of a cannon &s;ent to annoy her, he was obliged to concert his e&s;cape by land. He quitted his uniform, which he had hitherto worn under his &s;urtout, for a common coat. He was furni&s;hed with a hor&s;e, and under the name of John Ander&s;on. with a pa&s;&s;port from Ar|nold to go through the lines at White Plains or lower if he thought proper, he being on public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He pur&s;ued his journey alone towards York, pa&s;&s;ed all the guards and po&s;ts on the road without &s;u&s;picion, and was much elated. The next day he travelled without any alarm, and began to con&s;ider him&s;elf out of dangers but unhappily for him, three of the New-York militia were with others on a &s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing party between the out po&s;ts of the two armies. One of them &s;prung from his co|vert, and &s;eized And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> hor&s;e by the bridle. The major in&s;tead or in&s;tantly producing his pa&s;s, a&s;ked the man where he belonged to, who an&s;wered, <HI>"To below."</HI> Andre &s;u&s;pecting no deceit, &s;aid, <HI>"So do I."</HI> Then declared him&s;elf a Briti&s;h officer, and pre&s;&s;ed that he might not be detained, for that he was upon urgent bu&s;ine&s;s. Upon the other two coming up, and joining their comrade, he di&s;covering his mi&s;take. The confu&s;ion that followed was apparent, and they pro|ceeded to &s;earch him till they found his pa|pers.
<PB N="156" REF="025347_0158_0FCCFFFB7B98CE30">He offered the captors a con&s;iderable pur&s;e of gold, and a very valuable watch, to let him pa&s;s; but they nobly di&s;dained the temptation, be&s;ides the fa&s;cinating offers of permanent provi&s;ion, and even of future promotion, on condition of their conveying and accompanying him to Newyork They conducted him to Lieut. Col. Jame&s;on, the continental officer who had the command of the &s;couting parties, amounting to 800 men, chiefly militia. Arnold's conduct with regard to this body of men, and in other re|&s;pects, had excited &s;uch &s;u&s;picions in the brea&s;t of the lieutenant-colonel, and the re&s;t of the officers, that they had determined upon &s;eizing the general at all events, had he come down and ordered them nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er the enemy. Jame&s;on, notwith&s;tanding his &s;trong jealou&s;y of Arnold, was in the i&s;&s;ue the means of his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Major Andre, in order to give Arnold time to e&s;cape, reque&s;ted that a line might be &s;ent to acquaint him of the detention of Ander&s;on, the name Andre had a&s;&s;umed, which Jame&s;on, through an ill-judged deli|cacy granted. The papers, which were found in the major's boots, were in Arnold's hand writing, and contained exact returns of the &s;tate of the forces, ordnances and defences at We&s;t Point and its dependencies, with the artillery orders, critical remarks on the works, an e&s;timate of the number of men
<PB N="157" REF="025347_0159_0FCCFFFCF9F36B30" MS="y">that were ordinarily on duty to man them, and the copy of a &s;tate of matters that had been laid before a council of war by the commander in chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> The&s;e papers were enclo&s;ed in a packet to Gen. Wa&s;hington, accompanied with a letter from the pri&s;oner, avowing him&s;elf to be Major Andre, adju|tant general to the Briti&s;h army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavouring to &s;how, that he did not come under the de|&s;cription of a &s;py. The&s;e papers were for|warded by Jame&s;on.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Arnold received the Major's letter, than he ha&s;tened on board the Vul|ture, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay &s;ome miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points; and Arnold had not been long gone, when Wa&s;hington arrived at his quarters. Had the plot &s;ucceeded, the con|&s;equences mu&s;t have been ruinous to the Americans. The forces under Arnold's command mu&s;t have either laid down their arms, or have been cut to pieces. Their lo&s;s, and the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of We&s;t-Point, and all its neighbouring dependencies, mu&s;t have expo&s;ed the remainder of Wa&s;h|ington's army &s;o, to the joint exertion of the Briti&s;h forces, by land and water, that no|thing but ruin could have been the re&s;ult with re&s;pect to the Americans.</P>
<P>On the 29th of September Gen. Wa&s;h|ington appointed a board of fourteen general officers, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the judge ad|vocate
<PB N="158" REF="025347_0160_0FCCFFFE81301F78">general, to examine Major Andre's ca&s;e, and to determine in what light it ought to be con&s;idered. Andre, di&s;daining all &s;ub|terfuge and eva&s;ion, and &s;tudying only to place his character in &s;o fair a light, as might prevent its being &s;haded by pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, voluntarily confe&s;&s;ed more than he was a&s;ked, and &s;ought not to palliate any thing relating to him&s;elf, while he concealed, with the mo&s;t guarded and &s;crupulous nicety, whatever might involve others. The board &s;hewed him every po&s;&s;ible mark of indul|gence, and &s;ufficiently witne&s;&s;ed how much they felt for his &s;ituation. However, public ju&s;tice obliged them to declare, "that Major Andre ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;py from the enemy; and that agreeable to the law and u&s;age of nations, it is their opinion he ought to &s;uffer death."</P>
<P>Several letters pa&s;&s;ed between the Gene|rals Clinton and Wa&s;hington relative to this unhappy affair; but nothing was capa|ble of &s;aving the unfortunate major. On the 2d of October, the tragedy was clo&s;ed. The major was &s;uperior to the terrors of death; but the di&s;graceful mode of dying, which the u&s;age of war had annexed to his unhappy &s;ituation, was infinitely dreadful to him. He was de&s;irous of being indulged with a profe&s;&s;ional death, and had accordingly written, the day before, a pathetic letter, fraught with all the feelings of a man of &s;en|timent
<PB N="159" REF="025347_0161_0FCD0000DAAA3F88">and honor, in which he reque&s;ted of Gen. Wa&s;hington, that he might not die on a gibbet. The general con&s;ulted his officers on the &s;ubject. Pity and e&s;teem wrought &s;o powerfully, that they were all for &s;hooting him, till Greene in&s;i&s;ted on it, that his crime was that of a common &s;py; that the public good required his being hanged; and that, were he &s;hot, the generality would think there were favorable circum&s;tances entitling him to notice and lenity. His ob&s;ervations convinced them that there would be an impro|priety in granting the major's reque&s;t, while tenderne&s;s prevented its being divulged.</P>
<P>When Major Andre was led out to the place of execution, as he went along he bow|ed him&s;elf familiarly to all tho&s;e with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. &mdash;A &s;mile of complacency expre&s;&s;ed the &s;erene fortitude of his mind. Upon &s;eeing the preparations at the fatal &s;pot, he a&s;ked with &s;ome emotion, "Mu&s;t I die in this manner?" He was told it was unavoid|able. He replied "I am reconciled to my fate, but not to the mode." Soon after, re|collecting him&s;elf, he added "it will be but a momentary pang;" and &s;pringing upon the cart, he performed the la&s;t offices to him|&s;elf with a compo&s;ure that excited the admi|ration, and melted the hearts of all the &s;pec|tators. &mdash;Being told the final moment was at hand, and a&s;ked if he had any thing to &s;ay,

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Henry Clinton, on the 15th of Octo|ber, 1780, in obedience to the orders &s;ent him to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour in North Carolina and Virginia, di&s;patched Gen. Le&s;lie from New York to the bay of Che&s;apeak, with near 3000 choice troops. He was to co-operate with Lord Cornwallis, who was expected to be far advanced to|wards, if not to have reached Virginia. In a few days, the fleet arrived in the bay, and the troops were landed in different parts of Virginia.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, the French and Spani&s;h fleets formed a junction in the We&s;t Indies. They amounted to 36 &s;ail of the line which, with their united land forces, formed &s;uch an apparent &s;uperiority, as no|thing in tho&s;e &s;eas or i&s;lands &s;eemed capable of re&s;i&s;ting; but the Spani&s;h troops, being too much crowded on board their tran&s;ports, together with the length of the voyage, the change of climate and diet, and other cir|cum&s;tances, a mo&s;t mortal and contagious di&s;order was generated, which fir&s;t infected their own &s;eamen, and at length &s;pread, though not with &s;o fatal an effect, through the French fleet and land forces. Be&s;ides the great mortality on the pa&s;&s;age, the Spa|niards landed 1200 &s;ick on their fir&s;t arrival
<PB N="162" REF="025347_0164_0FCD00061DB88D10">at Dominique, and a much greater number afterwards at Gaudaloupe and Martinico. Thus the &s;pirit of enterprize was damped, and &s;ome part of their &s;trength dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the month of September, Mr. Laurens was taken on his way from congre&s;s to Hol|land, on the banks of Newfoundland. A packet of papers being thrown over-board, and not &s;inking &s;uddenly, was &s;aved by the boldne&s;s and dexterity of an Engli&s;h &s;ailor, and mo&s;t of them were recovered from the effects of the water On his arrival in England, he was committed, upon a charge of high trea&s;on, as a &s;tate pri&s;oner to the Tower, under an order &s;igned by the three &s;ecretaries of &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> By the medium of his papers, admini&s;tration came to the know|ledge of the eventual treaty of amity and commerce between America and Holland.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;covery, &s;trong remon&s;trances were made to the States Gene|ral; but, as no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer was re|turned, Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke received orders to withdraw from the Hague; and, on the 20th of December, general repri&s;als were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the &s;hips, goods, and &s;ubjects, of the States General.</P>
<P>On the 12th of January, 1781, General Greene's troops con&s;i&s;ted of about 1110. The next day, Col. Lee's partizan legion arrived from the northward, con&s;i&s;ting of about 100 hor&s;emen, well mounted, and 120
<PB N="163" REF="025347_0165_0FCD0007834E9690">infantry; and on the 13th the legion was detached on a &s;ecret expedition. They pu&s;hed on for Georgetown, where they &s;ur|pri&s;ed &s;everal officers, and took them pri|&s;oners Major Irwin, and many more of the garri&s;on were killed; but the principal part fled to the fort, which Lee was not in a condition to be&s;iege. While this enterprize was carrying on, the enemy aimed a blow at Morgan, who was advi&s;ed by Greene not to ri&s;que too much.</P>
<P>Gen.

On the 17th of January, Tarleton came up with Morgan, when an action com|menced, which terminated much to the di&s;|advantage of Tarle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</P>
<P>Tarleton was very much cen&s;ured for his conduct in this battle, which he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t by his un-officer like impetuo|&s;ity. Lord Cornwallis, with the expecta|tions of regaining the pri&s;oners, and demo|li&s;hing Morgan's corps, in&s;tantly concluded on a pur&s;uit, which Morgan was aware of, and took his mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>

On the 31&s;t of January, Greene &s;uc|ceeded Morgan in the command of the &s;outhern army, when a kind of military race commenced between the pur&s;uing Briti&s;h and the fleeing Americans; but Greene got off before Cornwallis could overtake him.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, being afterwards con|vinced from Greene's movements, that he intended to venture an engagement, on the 14th of May &s;ent off his baggage under a proper e&s;cort, and the next morning at day|break, marched with the remainder of his army, amounting to about 2400 men, chief|ly troops grown veterans in victory, either to meet Greene on the way, or attack him in his encampment.</P>
<P>The battle took place near Guilford court-hou&s;e; and after a hard &s;truggle of near two hours, the Americans retreated in good or|der to the Reedy Fork, and cro&s;&s;ed the river, about three miles from the field of action. Greene lo&s;t his artillery, and two ammuni|tion waggons, the greate&s;t part of the hor&s;es being killed before the retreat began.</P>
<P>In the month of February, repri&s;als hav|ing been commenced again&s;t the Dutch, Rodney and Vaughan received in&s;tructions from Great Britain to direct their views to the reduction of the Dutch i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatia. The Briti&s;h fleet and army in|&s;tantly appeared there, and &s;urrounded it with a great force. Rodney and Vaughan
<PB N="165" REF="025347_0167_0FCD000B60943D90">&s;ent a peremptory &s;ummons to the governor, to &s;urrender the i&s;land and its dependencies within an hour, accompanied with a threat, that if any re&s;i&s;tance was made, he mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences. Mon&s;. de Graaff. totally ignorant of the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, could &s;carcely believe the officer, who delivered the &s;um|mons, to be &s;erious. He returned for an|&s;wer, that being utterly incapable of making any defence, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;urrender, only recommending the town and inhabitants to the clemency of the Briti&s;h commanders. The weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of the place excited the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the conquerors, the whole in&s;land &s;eemed to be one great magazine. All the &s;torehou&s;es were filled with various com|modities, and the very beach was covered with hog&s;heads of &s;ugar and tobacco. The value was e&s;timated con&s;iderably above three millions &s;terling. But this was only a part; for above 150 ve&s;&s;els of all denominations, many of them richly laden, were captured in the bay, exclu&s;ive of a Dutch frigate of 38 guns, and five &s;maller. The neighboring &s;mall i&s;les of St Martin and Saba were redu|ced in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Rodney being informed, that a fleet of about 30 large &s;hips, all richly laden, with &s;ugar and other We&s;t India commodities, had &s;ailed from Eu&s;tatia for Holland ju&s;t be|fore his arrival, under convoy of a flag &s;hip of
<PB N="166" REF="025347_0168_0FCCDB881DF284E8">60 guns, he di&s;patched the Monarch and Panther, with the Sybil frigate in pur&s;uit of them. The&s;e &s;oon overtook the convoy, when the Dutch admiral refu&s;ing to &s;trike his col|ours, and all remon&s;trances proving ineffec|tual, a &s;hort engagement took place between his &s;hip, the Mars and the Monarque. He died bravely in defence of his &s;hip, when &s;he in&s;tantly &s;truck, and the whole convoy was taken.</P>
<P>The keeping of Dutch colours flying at Eu&s;tatia, rendered it for &s;ome time a decoy to French, Dutch, and American ve&s;&s;els, a con&s;iderable number of which fell accord|ingly into the hands of the conquerors with|out trouble.</P>
<P>Preparations began to be made, on the 21&s;t of June, for the army under Gen. Wa&s;hington to take the field The Amer|icans marched towards White Plains, where they were joined by the French troops under Rochambeau.</P>
<P>Sir George Rodney, in con&s;equence of in|formation concerning the French fleet un|der the Count de Gra&s;&s;e, detached the Ad|mirals Sir Samuel Hood and Drake, with &s;eventeen &s;ail of the line, to crui&s;e off Fort Royal for the purpo&s;e of intercepting him. On the 28th of April, &s;ome of Sir Samuel's headmo&s;t &s;hips returned ha&s;tily in &s;ight, and with &s;ignals announced the appearance of a &s;uperior fleet, and a numerous convoy, to
<PB N="167" REF="025347_0169_0FCD000DC1B94CA8">the windward of Point Salines. The ad|miral made a &s;ignal for a general chace to windward, and at night it was determined by the admirals to continue the line a-head, &s;o that getting as much as po&s;&s;ible to wind|ward, they might clo&s;e in with Fort Royal at day-light, and cut off the enemy from the harbour.</P>
<P>In the morning the French appeared, their convoy keeping clo&s;e in with the land, while Count de Gra&s;&s;e drew up his fleet in a line of battle for their protection. Admiral Hood u&s;ed every manaeuvre to bring him to action; but he being to windward, and &s;o having the choice, preferred a long &s;hot di&s;tance. A partial engagement en&s;ued. The van and the neare&s;t &s;hips, in the centre of the Bri|ti&s;h, were expo&s;ed to a long and heavy weight of fire, in their &s;truggles to clo&s;e the French, and get to the windward; but &s;uf|fered principally in their ma&s;ts, hulls, and rigging. The action la&s;ted about three hours, when Admiral Hood perceiving, that not one &s;hot in ten of the French reached, and that his attempts to gain the wind were fruitle&s;s, cea&s;ed firing, and the Briti&s;h fleet bore away for Antigua.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the tran&s;actions un|der Lord Cornwallis. One great object of the Briti&s;h force was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;trong po&s;t and place of arms, and &s;uch as might render them perfectly ma&s;ters of Che|&s;apeak

By the 15th of September, all the troops were arrived and landed at William&s;burgh, and preparations were made with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch for put|ting the army in a &s;ituation to move down towards York town.</P>
<P>On the 30th of September, Lord Corn|wallis was clo&s;ely inve&s;ted in York Town. The trenches were opened by the combined armies on the 6th of October, at 600 yards di&s;tance from Cornwallis's works. On the 9th they opened their batteries, and conti|nued firing all night, without intermi&s;&s;ion: The next morning the French opened their batteries on the left, and a tremendous roar of cannon and mortars was continued for &s;ix or eight hours without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The French and Americans continued to carry on the &s;iege with great &s;ucce&s;s On the 16th their &s;everal batteries were covered with near 100 pieces of heavy ordnance; while the Briti&s;h works were &s;o de&s;troyed that they could &s;carcely &s;how a &s;ingle gun. Thus was Lord Cornwallis reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for a &s;urrender, or of
<PB N="169" REF="025347_0171_0FCD0013790C5308">attempting an e&s;cape. He determined upon the latter. Boats were prepared under dif|ferent pretences, for the reception of the troops by ten at night, in order to pa&s;s them over to Glouce&s;ter-Point. The arrange|ments were made with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy. The intention was to abandon the baggage, and to leave a detachment behind to capitu|late for the town's people, and for the &s;ick and wounded, his lord&s;hip having already prepared a letter on the &s;ubject, to be deli|vered to Gen. Wa&s;hington after his depar|ture. The fir&s;t embarkation had arrived at Glouce&s;ter Point, and the greater part of the troops were already landed, when the wea|ther, which was before moderate and calm, in&s;tantly changed to a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind and rain The bouts with the remain|ing troops were all driven down the river, and the de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing over was not only en|tirely fru&s;trated, but the ab&s;ence of the boats rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to bring back the troops from Glouce&s;ter. Thus weakened and divided, the army was in no &s;mall dan|ger. However, the boats returned, and the troops were brought back in the cour&s;e of the forenoon with very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s.</P>
<P>Things were now ha&s;tening to a period, which could be no longer protracted; for the Briti&s;h works were &s;inking under the weight of the French and American artillery. All hopes of relief from New York were over,
<PB N="170" REF="025347_0172_0FCD00156D116E08">and the &s;trength and &s;pirits of the royal army were broken down and exhau&s;ted by their con&s;tant and unremitting fatigue. Matters being in this &s;inuation on the 17th of Oc|tober, Lord Cornwallis &s;ent out a flag with a letter to Gen. Wa&s;hington, reque&s;ting a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for twenty four hours, and that commi&s;&s;ioners might be appointed for dige&s;ting the terms of capitulation. Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were accordingly appointed; and on the &s;ide of the allies, were Vi&s;e. de Noailles, and Lieut. Col. Laurens, who&s;e father was in clo&s;e confinement in the Tower of London, while the &s;on was drawing up articles, by which an Engli&s;h nobleman and a Briti&s;h army became pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>On the 19th of October, the po&s;ts of York Town and Glouce&s;ter were &s;urren|dered. The honour of marching out with colours flying, which had been denied to Gen. Lincoln, was now refu&s;ed to Lord Cornwallis, and Lincoln was appointed to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the royal army at York Town, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame way his own had been conducted about eighteen months before. The troops that &s;urrendered pri&s;oners exceeded 7000; but &s;o great was the number of &s;ick and wounded, that there were only 3800 capable of doing duty. The officers and &s;oldiers retained their baggage and effects. Fifteen hundred &s;eamen &s;hared the &s;ame fate as the garri&s;on. The Gauda|loupe
<PB N="171" REF="025347_0173_0FCD0017158EC898">frigate of 24 guns, and a number of tran&s;ports, were &s;urrendered to the conquer|ors. About twenty tran&s;ports had been &s;unk or burnt during the &s;iege. The land forces became pri&s;oners to congre&s;s; but the &s;ea|men and &s;hips were a&s;&s;igned to the French admiral. The Americans obtained a fine train of artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of 75 bra&s;s ord|nance, and 69 iron cannon, howitzers, and mortars.</P>
<P>On the 24th of October, a fleet de&s;tined for the relief of Lord Cornwallis arrived off the Che&s;apeak; but, on receiving the news of his &s;urrender, they returned to New York. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 25 &s;hips of the line, two fifties, and eight frigates. When they appeared off the Che&s;apeak, the French made no manner of movement, though they had 36 &s;hips of the line, being perhaps &s;atisfied with their pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, Every argument and per&s;ua&s;ion was u&s;ed with the Count de Gra&s;&s;e to induce him to aid the combined army in an operation again&s;t Charle&s;town; but the advanced &s;ea|&s;on, the orders of his court, and his own engagements to be punctual to a certain time, fixed for his &s;uture operations, prevented his compliance. His in&s;tructions had fixed his departure on the 15th of October, and he had already exceeded that time. On the 27th the troops under the Marquis St. Simon began to embark for the We&s;t Indies, and

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 27th of November, the king of England went to the hou&s;e of peers, and opened the &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament. Warm debates took place on account of the ruin|ous manner in which the American war was continued; but Lord North and his party, who thought they had not yet carried things far enough, maintained a con&s;iderable ma|jority in the hou&s;e of commons. Mr. Burke had made &s;everal motions, relative to the re|lea&s;e of Mr. Laurens from the Tower. However, at length, Mr. Laurens was brought before Lord Mansfield, on the la&s;t day of the vear, in con&s;equence of an order from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and was di&s;|charged upon certain conditions.</P>
<P>The naval force of France and Spain in the We&s;t Indies, in the month of February, 1782, amounted to 60 &s;hips of the line, and their land forces when joined would have formed a con&s;iderable army. Jamaica had no more than &s;ix incomplete battal ons of regular troops and the militia of the i&s;land to defend it; and therefore in ca&s;e of at|tack, mu&s;t have been &s;oon conquered. The arrival of Sir George Rodney with twelve &s;ail of the line at Barbadoes, and his &s;ub&s;e|quent junction with Sir Samuel Hood's
<PB N="174" REF="025347_0176_0FCD001BECC97828">&s;quadron, together with the arrival of three &s;hips of the line from England a few days af|terwards, perhaps providentially &s;aved Ja|maica from falling into the hands of the ene|my. The Engli&s;h fleet at St. Lucia amount|ing to 36 &s;hips of the line, and the force un|der de Gra&s;&s;e at Martinico to 34. The metal of the French is always heavier than that of the Engli&s;h, in equal rates, &s;o that in this point the French had the advantage.</P>
<P>The van of the Briti&s;h fleet was com|manded by Sir Samuel Hood, the centre by Sir George Redney, and the rear by Admiral Sir Francis Drake. The three divi&s;ions of the French fleet were under Count de Gra&s;&s;e, Mon&s;. de Vaudreuil, and Mon&s;. de Bo|gainville.</P>
<P>On the 8th of April, the French fleet be|gan to turn out of Fort Royal harbor early in the morning, with a great convoy under their protection, all bound to the French or Spani&s;h ports in Hi&s;panicla. De Gra&s;&s;e, in order to avoid an encounter on his pa&s;&s;age, meant to keep clo&s;e in under the i&s;lands, till be had eluded the pur&s;uit of the Engli&s;h. However their departure from the bay was &s;o &s;peedily communicated by &s;ignals from the frigates, and the Engli&s;h fleet was in &s;uch ex|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilent preparati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, that all the &s;hips were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ar of Gro&s;s I&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Bay by noon, and pur|&s;ued with the utmo&s;t expedition; &s;o that the French &s;aved only a few hours, by being
<PB N="175" REF="025347_0177_0FCD001E3230FBD8">ma&s;ters of the time of departure. The Engli&s;h gained &s;ight of them under Domi|nique at night, and afterwards regulated the pur&s;uit by &s;ignals.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, Count de Gra&s;&s;e formed the line of battle, and thereby af|forded an opportunity to his convoy for pro|ceeding on their cour&s;e, while he remained to abide the con&s;equences. The van of the Engli&s;h fleet fir&s;t clo&s;ed with the French centre, while the Engli&s;h centre and rear were becalmed. The action commenced about nine o'clock on the ninth. The Bar|fleur, Sir Samuel. Hood's own &s;hip, had at times &s;even and generally three &s;hips firing up|on her, and none of the divi&s;ion e&s;caped encountering a di&s;proportionate force. The firm and effectual re&s;i&s;tance with which they &s;upported all the efforts of the enemy's &s;u|periority, was to the highe&s;t degree glorious. At length the leading &s;hips of the centre were enabled to come up to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e were &s;oon followed by Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his &s;econds the Namur and the Duke, all of 90 guns: they made and &s;upported a mo&s;t tremendous &s;ire. De Gra&s;&s;e now changed the nature of the action, and kept at &s;uch a di&s;tance during the remainder of the engagement, as might prevent any thing deci&s;ive happening. The re&s;t of the Engli&s;h fleet coming up De Gra&s;&s;e withdrew his &s;hips from the action,
<PB N="176" REF="025347_0178_0FCD001F81F17790">and evaded all the efforts of the Engli&s;h commanders for its renewal. Two of the French &s;hips were &s;o damaged, that they were obliged to quit the fleet, and put into Guadaloupe. On the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h. the Royal Oak and the Montague &s;uffered ex|tremely; but they were capable of being repaired at &s;ea, &s;o as not to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of quitting the fleet.</P>
<P>On the 11th the French fleet weathered Guadaloupe, and gained &s;uch a di&s;tance, that the body of their fleet could only be de&s;cried from the ma&s;t-heads of the Briti&s;h centre, and all hopes of Sir George Rodney's com|ing up with them &s;eemed to be at an end. In this critical &s;ituation, one of the French &s;hips, which had &s;uffered in the action, was perceived, about noon, to fall off con&s;ider|ably from the re&s;t of the fleet to leeward. This produced &s;ignals from the Engli&s;h ad|miral for a general cha&s;e, which was &s;o vig|orous, that the Agamemnon, and &s;ome others of the headmo&s;t of the Engli&s;h line, were coming up &s;o fa&s;t with this &s;hip that &s;he would a&s;&s;uredly have been cut off before evening, had not her &s;ignals and eminent danger induced de Gra&s;&s;e to bear down with his whole fleet to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This movement put it out of the power of the French to avoid fighting. The pur&s;uing Engli&s;h fell back into their &s;tation, and a clo&s;e line was formed.&mdash;.The French al&s;o
<PB N="177" REF="025347_0179_0FCD00210DF33A60">prepared for battle with the greate&s;t re&s;olu|tion, and the night pa&s;&s;ed in preparations on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock in the morning, of the 12th of April, the battle commenced, and was continued with unremitting fury until near the &s;ame hour in the evening. As the Engli&s;h came up, they ranged &s;lowly along the French line, and clo&s;e under their lee. Being &s;o near, every &s;hot took effect, and the French &s;hips being &s;o full of men, the carnage in them was prodigious. The Formidable, Admiral Rodney's &s;hip, fired near eighty broad&s;ides, and it may be &s;up|po&s;ed the re&s;t were not idle. The French &s;tood and returned this dreadful fire with the utmo&s;t firmne&s;s, each &s;ide fighting, as if the the honor and fate of their country were that day to be decided.</P>
<P>Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his &s;econds the Namur and the Duke, and immediatly &s;upported by the Canada, between twelve and one o'clock, bore di|rectly and with full &s;ail athwart the French line and &s;ucce&s;sfully broke through, about three &s;hips &s;hort of the centre, where Count de Gra&s;&s;e commanded in the Ville de Paris of 110 guns. Being followed and &s;upported by the remainder of his divi&s;ion, and wear|ing round clo&s;e about the enemy, he effec|tually &s;eperated their line. This bold ad|venture proved deci&s;ive. The battle la&s;ted
<PB N="178" REF="025347_0180_0FCD00236AE08448">till &s;un-&s;et, for the French fought with the greate&s;t bravery.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h fleet having now gained the wind of the French, their general confu&s;ion was completed. Hood's divi&s;ion had been long becalmed and kept out of action; but his head &s;hips and part of his centre, as far at lea&s;t as the Barfleur, which he him&s;elf commanded, came up at this juncture, and contributed to render the victory more deci|&s;ive. The Cae&s;ar, Glorieux, and Hector, &s;oon &s;truck their colours but not till after they had made the mo&s;t noble defence.</P>
<P>Count de Gra&s;&s;e was nobly &s;upported even after the line was broken; and the Diadem, a French 74, went down by a &s;ingle broad|&s;ide, in a generous exertion to &s;ave him. The Ville de Paris was almo&s;t reduced to a wreck, but de Gra&s;&s;e &s;till held out. At length, Hood in the Barfleur approached him ju&s;t at &s;un-&s;et, and poured in a mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive fire. The Ville de Paris &s;upported all the&s;e &s;hocks for a quarter of an hour after, when &s;he &s;truck to Sir Samuel Hood. It was &s;aid, that, at the time &s;he &s;truck, there were but three men left alive and unhurt on the upper deck, and that the Count was one of them.</P>
<P>The Cae&s;ar was unfortuna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;et on fire, and blew up in the night of the action. A lieutenant and fifty Engli&s;h &s;eamen peri&s;hed, with about 400 pri&s;oners. The number of
<PB N="179" REF="025347_0181_0FCD0024B82CE7B8">the French &s;lain in this engagement, and that of the ninth, was computed at three thou&s;and and near double that number wounded. The &s;mall &s;uperiority of Briti&s;h &s;hips in point of number, contributed nothing to the &s;ucce&s;s of the day, as more of Hood's divi&s;ion than that difference amounted to, were prevented coming into action through the want of wind. The whole lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h, in killed and wounded in the two actions, was &s;tated only at 1050, of which 253 were killed on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>In the Ville de Paris were found thirty &s;ix che&s;ts of money, de&s;tined to pay the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of the troops in the de&s;igned attack on Jamaica. Sir Samuel Hood being &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the &s;cattered enemy, on the 19th he came up and took the Ja&s;on and Caton, of 64 guns each, and two frigates.</P>
<P>Thus the French lo&s;t eight &s;hips of the line: &s;ix were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, one had been &s;unk, and the Cae&s;ar blew up after her capture. The Engli&s;h having join|ed off Cape Tiberoon, and the French having no force to the windward. Sir George Rodney proceeded with the di&s;abled &s;hips and pri|zes to Jamaica, as well for their repair, as the greater &s;ecurity of the I&s;land, &s;hould the combined fleet &s;till venture upon the pro&s;ecu|tion of their former de&s;ign. Sir Samuel Hood was left with about 25 &s;hips of the
<PB N="180" REF="025347_0182_0FCD00263B806FE8">line to keep the &s;ea, and watch the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>Let us now return to North America, where all parties &s;eemed to be heartily tired of the war. On the 5th of May, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, and on the 7th he wrote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Gen. Wa&s;hington, and &s;ent him &s;ome public papers, that his excellency might learn from them, the di&s;po&s;ition that prevailed in the government and people of Great Britain, relative to the making of a peace with America.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h admini&s;tration having re&s;olved upon abandoning all offen&s;ive operations in America, the &s;cheme of evacuating all the weake&s;t po&s;ts in the United States was adopt|ed. Accordingly, on the 11th of July Sa|vannah was evacuated, and the Americans im|mediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, the works and town being left perfect.</P>
<P>On the 14th of December, Gen. Le&s;lie, who commanded at Charle&s;ton completed the embarkation of his troops on his quitting that town. Gen. Wayne, with the legion and light infantry, had been before their works for &s;everal days, by order of Gen. Greene. It was hinted to him from Gen. Le&s;lie, through a certain medium, that if they were permitted to embark without interruption, every care &s;hould be taken for the pre&s;erva|tion of the town. Wayne was directed to accede to the propo&s;al, the Briti&s;h al&s;o agree|ing

The conditions being fully under&s;tood by both parties, Charle&s;town was evacua|ted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t confu|&s;ion, the American advance following clo&s;e on the Briti&s;h rear. The governor was con|ducted into his capital the &s;ame day; the civ|il police e&s;tabli&s;hed the day following, and on the third the town was opened for bu&s;ine&s;s. On the 17th the Briti&s;h cro&s;&s;ed the bar, and went to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Every thing now &s;eemed to announce the approach of peace. The American commi&s;|&s;ioners expedited the negociation with the ut|mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, and on the 30th of November, provi&s;ional articles were agreed upon and &s;ign|ed, to take effect whenever terms of peace &s;hould be finally &s;ettled with the court of France. The bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed &s;o privately and unex|pectedly that the mini&s;ters and emba&s;&s;adors, as well as others in and about the court of Ver|&s;ailles, were &s;urpri&s;ed upon hearing the news.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not here avoid mentioning an unfortunate event, which happened at the clo&s;e of the &s;till more unfortunate American war. Ten men of war, including Count de Gra&s;&s;e's &s;hips, with a large fleet of merchant. men from Jamaica &s;uffered exceedingly by a tremendous gale of wind off Newfound|land, on the 17th of September. The Ville de Paris and the Glorieux foundered, and only one man out of the complement of both
<PB N="182" REF="025347_0185_0FCD002B7AD3D080">&s;hips e&s;caped to tell the melancholy tale. The Hector al&s;o &s;unk; but being de&s;cried in time by a &s;now that made towards them, the crew were &s;aved. The Ramilies went down, but her people were &s;aved by the merchantmen in company. The Centaur was likewi&s;e lo&s;t, and all her company, except twelve, with the captain, who got into the only remaining boat. They traver&s;ed a &s;pace of near 800 miles on the Atlantic ocean, without compa&s;s or quadrant, and with a blanket for a &s;ail. They had only two bi&s;cuits divided among them every twenty-four hours; and as much water during that &s;pace to every man, as the neck of a wine bottle broken off would hold. At the expiration of &s;ixteen days when the la&s;t divi&s;ion of bi&s;cuit and water had been made, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, they di&s;cov|ered the Portugue&s;e i&s;land of Fayal, where they &s;afely arrived at night, and received every a&s;&s;i&s;tance their melancholy &s;ituation de|manded.</P>
<P>On the 3d of September, 1783, the defin|itive treaties between Great Britain, France, and Spain, were &s;igned at Ver&s;ailles by the Duke of Manche&s;ter, and the plenipoten|tiaries of &s;aid court. On the &s;ame day, the definitive treaty with Great Britain and the United States of America was al&s;o &s;igned at Paris, by David Hartley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Briti&s;h plenipotentiary, and the plenipotentiaries of the &s;aid &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="025347_0186_0FCD002D14CF4928">
By the articles of this treaty, his Britannic maje&s;ty acknowledged the independence of the United States of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts Bay, Rhode i&s;land and Providence Plantations, Connecticut.. New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. He al&s;o relinqui&s;hed all claims to the government of them, and con&s;ented to treat with them as a free and independent people: Their boun|daries were al&s;o &s;ettled, and they were allow|ed the liberty of fi&s;hing and drying fi&s;h as u&s;ual on the banks of Newfoundland.</P>
<P>The particulars of the treaty between Great Britain, France, and Spain will be found in our Hi&s;tory of England, to which it more properly belongs.</P>
<P>Thus ended the unhappy American war, which added to the national debt of the mo|ther-country one hundred and twenty mil|lions, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of many thou&s;ands of our brave&s;t officers, &s;oldiers, and &s;eamen, to the eternal infamy and di&s;grace of tho&s;e min|i&s;ters, who advi&s;ed and carried it on, con|trary to the general voice of the people!</P>
