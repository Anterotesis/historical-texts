<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>February</HI> 16, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS a by-&s;tander this day, when your Lord|&s;hip and the Hou&s;e of Lords decided the very important cau&s;e of Philip Thickne&s;s, appel|lant, and Peter Leigh and others, re&s;pondents, and though unconnected with the parties, and con|&s;equently unintere&s;ted in the event, I mu&s;t own I was forcibly &s;truck by a &s;cene &s;o novel and un|expected. I &s;tood, my Lord, with &s;ilent awe, at the bar of that tribunal which I had ever been ac|cu&s;tomed to con&s;ider, as the la&s;t refuge of injured ju&s;tice, I expected to hear a que&s;tion of law, of infinite nicety, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with wi&s;dom, and decided with integrity. Judge then, my Lord, my a&s;to|ni&s;hment, when in&s;tead of that decency in debate, which ought to be ob&s;erved even in the lowe&s;t court of ju&s;tice, and which I had ever thought in a peculiar manner characteri&s;tic of the Hou&s;e of Lords, I &s;aw proceedings which would have di&s;|graced a Poli&s;h diet! Yes, my Lord, in all my experience of courts of ju&s;tice, I never &s;aw Judges &s;o avowedly corrupt, &s;o indecently profligate as your Lord&s;hip and Lord Denbigh! Lord Cam|den delivered his opinion on the que&s;tion, in an argument that will carry, to the late&s;t times, his fame, and your di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="013954_0002_0F925C250D957678">
Your Lord&s;hip, in an&s;wer to him, delivered your &s;entiments; I cannot call them an argument, be|cau&s;e there was nothing that re&s;embled a chain of rea&s;oning; and indeed your Lord&s;hip &s;eemed more to rely on the letter you had received from Sir William De Grey, and the conver&s;ation you &s;aid you had with Sir Eardley Wilmot and Sir Stafford Smythe, than on any rea&s;ons you could advance in &s;upport of your decree. When Lord Camden, with a decency becoming the occa&s;ion, and the place in which he &s;poke, reminded your Lord|&s;hip how improper it was for a Judge, deciding &s;o nice and difficult a que&s;tion of property in the highe&s;t tribunal of the kingdom, to talk of opini|ons of men, not Judges in that court, who had given their &s;entiments in private, probably without much con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, mo&s;t certainly without hearing the facts &s;tated, and the que&s;tion di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by coun&s;el, what treatment did he meet with? Lord Denbigh's attack upon him was the attack of a ruffian, hired to carry through a profligate mea&s;ure by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating every man who &s;hould attempt oppo&s;ition? Your Lord&s;hip's language was &s;omewhat more decent; it was the language of ignorance, delivered with that in&s;o|lence which a week and a vain man feels, confi|dent in a corrupt majority. Has your Lord&s;hip &s;till to learn, that the opinion of a Judge, though delivered in the cour&s;e of a cau&s;e in open court, and handed down in print, yet if it is on a point, not before him as a Judge, is never allowed to be cited even by coun&s;el in argument? And wi&s;ely &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, my Lord, for the law of this country gives credit to the opinions of the Judges only on tho&s;e points which are nece&s;&s;arily brought before them in the cour&s;e of judicial proceedings. On
<PB N="51" REF="013954_0003_0F925C25B83AF560">the&s;e points, when they have heard the arguments of coun&s;el, they decide, if erroneou&s;ly, the injured party has his remedy by appeal, if corruptly and iniquitou&s;ly, the deci&s;ion of the Judge appears on the record, and he is amenable to his country's ju&s;tice. Lord&s;hip ignorant that this is the law, or can your Lord&s;hip &s;ay, or will any other man &s;ay for you, that in the cour&s;e of his attendance on courts of law, he ever before knew a private let|ter, and private conver&s;ation, adduced by a Judge, not as arguments furni&s;hing rea&s;ons for an opinion, but as authorities in law, to warrant his deci&s;ion? My Lord, I will defy your Lord&s;hip, with all your long li&s;t of advi&s;ers, from the hollow hearted Lord, who made you Chancellor, down to the lowe&s;t driveller who feeds your vanity with flattery, to &s;ay that &s;uch a &s;ight was ever before exhibited in a court of ju&s;tice. From the exi&s;tence of courts of law in this i&s;land, no man, ever before this day, &s;aw a private letter produced, read, and relied on as authority by a Judge, pronouncing judgment. Are the arguments of council mockery? Or are they &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t matter, to be weighed by tho&s;e who are to decide. The judgment of your Lord&s;hip and the Hou&s;e of Peers this day was avowedly founded on the authorities of men, who had never heard the que&s;tion di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by coun&s;el. If this mode of deciding is to prevail in courts of ju&s;tice, arguments by coun&s;el are needle&s;s. Your Lord&s;hip can decide without hearing them. No|thing more is requi&s;ite than for your Lord&s;hip to write a letter to &s;ome friend, his an&s;wer read in court by your Lord&s;hip will &s;tand in the place both of authority and argument. Is this the way in which ju&s;tice is to be di&s;pen&s;ed to the &s;ubject, in the &s;upreme tribunals of the country, the Chan|cery, and Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="013954_0004_0F925C2698998028">
O, &s;eats of Talbot and of Hardwicke, from whence tho&s;e great and god-like men, with pure hearts, and wi&s;dom more than human, &s;hed on this happy land the fragrant dews of ju&s;tice, from whence the vanqui&s;hed &s;uitor was wont to retire &s;atisfied, by the arguments he had heard, that he had been mi&s;taken in his claim, how is your glory faded! The wretched thing, who now fills the place of your late bright inhabitants, attempts not to give rea&s;ons for his deci&s;ions; but tells the &s;uitor, in plain terms, that he decides the cau&s;e on the authority of a letter from one of his friends, who had never heard the facts openly &s;tated, or an argument from coun&s;el on the &s;ubject. My Lord, were I to tell a man, bred up in the courts of Talbot and of Hardwicke, that a Chancellor of this country had decided a que&s;tion on an exe|cutory devi&s;e, on the authority of a letter from Sir William De Grey, who had never heard an argu|ment on the que&s;tion, he would tell me it was a LYE; it would be impo&s;&s;ible to be true, it would be as repugnant to all ideas of a Chan|cellor's proceedings, as if I was to tell him, that on the fir&s;t day of the term, I had &s;een the Chancellor carried round We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall in Bacchanalian triumph, the train, mace, and pur&s;e born by three drunken trulls, picked out of a brandy &s;hop at Temple-Bar. My Lord, men's minds are formed by what they have been accu&s;|tomed to. Tho&s;e who remember the poli&s;hed manners and elegant arguments of former Chan|cellor's, are &s;hocked at your Lord&s;hip's brutal de|ci&s;ion. <HI>Sic volo, &s;ic jubeo.</HI> My Lord, I do not u&s;e the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as merely &s;imilar to your Lord|&s;hip's, I do aver that &s;ince your Lord&s;hip has had the cu&s;tody of the great &s;eal, I have heard
<PB N="53" REF="013954_0005_0F925C2736DC1910">you decide a que&s;tion at law, argued by an emi|nent council, in the&s;e very words,&mdash;I am of a different opinion. I heard your Lord&s;hip decide in the&s;e words, I heard that very deci&s;ion rever&s;ed as erroneous. My Lord, your Lord&s;hip's conduct is become too glaringly de&s;picable. When the great &s;eal had been taken from Lord Camden, for dar|ing to &s;peak his &s;entiments in parliament, and the ever to be lamented Yorke had, by a virtuous death, atoned too &s;everely for the weakne&s;s of an unguard|ed moment (for who can with&s;tand the per&s;ua&s;ion of Kings. when they become &s;uitors) the gap was to be &s;topped. It was nece&s;&s;ary that the office of Chancellor &s;hould be filled. Your Lord&s;hip was pitched upon by Lord Mansfield, as a man who being too weak to form opinions of his own, would pay implicit obedience to his dictates; and, in cha|racter of the great law officer, avow legal opinions, his patron might be unwilling to ri&s;que. This was the ground on which your Lord&s;hip was made Chancellor. The nation &s;aw it, and lamented that an office of &s;uch infinite importance &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of from &s;uch motives, and to &s;uch a man. For my Lord, do you think the world ever con&s;idered you as a lawyer. Tho&s;e, who had at|tended We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, knew that your abilities as a man, and your knowledge as a lawyer, were below contempt. They knew that in the character of an advocate you had never got &pound;.200 a year, in all the courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter taken together. They were a&s;toni&s;hed when you were made a Judge, but they were exa&s;perated when you were made Chancellor. In the di&s;charge of the duty of that office, they &s;aw that your deci&s;ions were ever un&s;up|ported by argument, from hence they were led to &s;u&s;|pect that your decrees were made by others. This
<PB N="54" REF="013954_0006_0F925C2B5809B790">they &s;u&s;pected, but they did not know it, till your Lord&s;hip, in the debate of this day, put the mat|ter beyond a doubt. You will &s;ay, perhaps, a Chan|cellor may a&s;k the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who&s;e judg|ment he e&s;teems. True, my Lord, but let him call on them in the character of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, that they may hear the arguments of council, that they may be an&s;werable for the doctrines they lay down, and that the &s;uitor may know by who&s;e opinion his pro|perty is bound. My Lord, this is your character drawn with more truth than by tho&s;e &s;ycophants who tell you that you are a greater Chancellor than Hardwicke, Talbot, or Camden! No man ever doubted about your head; the conduct of this day has fixed men's opinion of your heart. My Lord, it was a foul proceeding.</P>
<P>It was a black day's work, ju&s;tice &s;eemed in eclip&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;uitor had &s;een with grief in what weak hands the great &s;eal was entru&s;ted, but when he &s;aw that if your ignorance led you to decide erro|neou&s;ly, a packed Hou&s;e of Peers might be brought together to &s;acrifice his property to your vanity, he was &s;truck with horror. My Lord, the nation will not bear it, and after the &s;cene of this day, your Lord&s;hip cannot hold the Great Seal.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> When the decree was affirmed, there was not above five or &s;ix Lords in the Hou&s;e, be&s;ides Lord Camden, and the pre&s;ent Chancellor. Lord Paulet (to his honor be it recorded) moved to have the Judges called in. This motion was over-ruled, and he retired. It was the Duke of Chandois, Lord Denbigh, Lord Cathcart, and Lord Gallo|way, who took upon them&s;elves to decide a nice
<PB N="55" REF="013954_0007_0F925C2C94C1D3D8">que&s;tion of law, which ought to have been argued with wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion, but which was debated with pa&s;&s;ion, and decided by party zeal. In &s;hort, what rai&s;ed the Chancellor, ruined the &s;uitor&mdash; THE TIMES.</P>
<P>Note. When the Hou&s;e of Lords were met to hear the cau&s;e, a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to Lord Mans|field by the Chancellor, to know if he would attend. But the Chancellor very well knew he would not attend. He knew that Lord Mansfield could not re&s;i&s;t the arguments of Lord Camden, and that he mu&s;t concur with him in rever&s;ing the decree. Lord Mansfield therefore &s;taid in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall, to decide the property of twenty|five pounds, and neglected his duty to attend, where ten thou&s;and pounds were at &s;take as well as the honor of the nation. He well knew the hone&s;t zeal of Lords Catchcart and Galloway, the villany of Lord Denbigh, and the folly of the cajoled Duke of Chandois, he knew that they would attend con&s;tantly, to take notes in order to form a determination they went into the Hou&s;e prepared for; namely, to affirm the decree, and do for Lord Mansfield what he dur&s;t not do him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield's per&s;onal di&s;like to the &s;uitor has long been well known. When he appeared at the bar of the King's Bench, to receive judg|ment for libelling Lord Orwell, Lord Mansfield jumped from the &s;eat of ju&s;tice, and with fury in his eyes, and an agitation of body con&s;o|nant thereto, exclaimed&mdash;Commit him! Commit him! An indecency of behaviour which a&s;toni&s;hed the whole court.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have &s;een a letter from Sir William De Grey, in an&s;wer to one from
<PB N="56" REF="013954_0008_0F925C2D4132B3A0">the appellant, reque&s;ting to know, whether the letter read by your Lord&s;hip in the Hou&s;e of Peers, was read with his privity. Sir William De Grey's an&s;wer is in the&s;e words:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am entirely a &s;tranger to what has been pa&s;&s;ing in the Hou&s;e of Lords upon the &s;ubject of your letter, not knowing till a day or two ago, that there was any cau&s;e depending there, in which you were intere&s;ted; and then only in ca&s;ual conver&s;ation.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, &amp;c.
WILLIAM DE GREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>On this letter I &s;hall make but one comment. Either Sir William De Grey's an&s;wer to the appel|lant contains an untruth, or your Lord&s;hip has practi&s;ed, on the Hou&s;e of Peers, an impo&s;ition of the blacke&s;t dye.</P>
