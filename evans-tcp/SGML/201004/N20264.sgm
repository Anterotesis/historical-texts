<P><HI>THE</HI> following Sermon was delivered, a few weeks ago, in the Rev. Mr. Robert An|nan's church, Philadelphia, and, &s;ince, in the Rev. Mr. John M. Ma&s;on's, New-York. The Author does not pretend to be able to &s;ay any thing new on the &s;ubject; or to clothe his ideas with &s;uperior elegance of diction. His aim, in all his pulpit-performances, is to expre&s;s him|&s;elf with per&s;pecuity and ea&s;e. He has con|templated, with grief, the total neglect of the wor&s;hip of God in &s;ome families, and the care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, the formality attending it in other. If the following plain di&s;cour&s;e be the means of doing good to any, his end is gained.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE mournful neglect of Family Re|ligion is, I believe, one of the principal grounds of Jehovah's controver&s;y with us in this <HI>day of trouble, of bla&s;phemy, and of rebuke.</HI> To recommend it to your atten|tion is the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e. I wi&s;h to remind you of a few obvious con&s;ider|ations, which could not fail to recur to your&s;elves, were you to think &s;eriou&s;ly up|on the &s;ubject. Religion has every thing to recommend it to us. It is its own re|ward. <HI>Them, that honour me,</HI> &s;ays the gra|cious Redeemer, <HI>I will honour; and they that de&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="026576_0004_0FD0AC53B256E2F8">
The words of a dear friend, e&s;pecially his <HI>la&s;t</HI> words, make a deep, a permanent impre&s;&s;ion upon our minds. We remem|ber them with care. We meditate often upon them. The words of my text appear to have been part of Jo&s;hua's farewell ad|dre&s;s to I&s;rael. He &s;aw the day of his di&s;|&s;olution drawing nigh; when he was to receive the cele&s;tial reward of his &s;ervices. We are told in the twenty-ninth ver&s;e of this chapter, that <HI>he died, being an hundred and ten years old.</HI> How impartial is death! The grim me&s;&s;enger knows no di&s;tinctions. The brave&s;t champions of war fall pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly with the &s;ons of cowardice. Like many, very many parents and govern|ors, the Hebrew General was not uncon|cerned what cour&s;e his family and follow|ers pur&s;ued, after death removed him from them. No. Prompted by the duties of a wi&s;e commander, and impelled by the feelings of a pious father, he gathered the cho&s;en tribes to Shechem; reminded them of the memorable appearances, which the God of Abram had made for them; and &s;olemnly charged them to walk in his ways. How exemplary is his re&s;olution in my text! As if he had &s;aid, "Children! Hearken unto Jo&s;hua your father. Ere long you &s;hall &s;ee me no more in this
<PB N="5" REF="026576_0005_0FD0AC560ECD3328">world. With all the tenderne&s;s, which the immediate pro&s;pect of our &s;eparation in|&s;pires, I wi&s;h to put you in mind of your duty. Remember, I be&s;eech you, <HI>the one thing needful.</HI> There is a nece&s;&s;ity for you to make, if you have not already made, a choice in religion. How dete&s;table is the idolatry of your fathers, who &s;erved &s;trange Gods! Renouncing this, <HI>fear</HI> the God of I&s;rael, <HI>and &s;erve him in &s;incerity and in truth.&mdash;As for me and my hou&s;e,</HI> if I be a|ble to influence their choice, <HI>we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> I am a veteran in his &s;ervice. But, in&s;tead of wi&s;hing to recant, in&s;tead of repenting my choice, I would make it a thou&s;and times, were it practicable; and may my authority and example continue to &s;peak to you, when I am &s;leeping in the du&s;t!"</P>
<P>To excite you, my friends, to &s;tudy a humble imitation, if not a holy emula|tion, of Jo&s;hua's pious example, I will call your attention to the following con&s;ider|ations. And</P>
<P>FIRST, It belongs to God him&s;elf to unite and to di&s;&s;olve families.</P>
<P>Says the P&s;almi&s;t, he <HI>maketh him families like a flock.</HI> How con&s;picuous is divine
<PB N="6" REF="026576_0006_0FD0AC59EDAC6200">wi&s;dom in the arrangement of human af|fairs! Jehovah, &s;itting in his holy habita|tion, at the helm of the univer&s;e, does all things wi&s;ely and well. No change, which takes place in either the world or the church, is to be attributed to the caprice of contingency; for, &s;trictly &s;peaking, there is no <HI>chance.</HI> Is not &s;ociety, whatever form it a&s;&s;umes, under the &s;uperintend|ence of heaven? Is the conjunction of &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons in a dome&s;tic relation accidental? No. The &s;overeign Ruler a|mong the nations determined that they &s;hould be born at a particular period; in a particular part of the world, and be con|nected as members of one hou&s;ehold. Is it by chance that a ma&s;ter has &s;uch a &s;ervant, or a &s;ervant &s;uch a ma&s;ter? No. However incon&s;iderable and frivolous the&s;e things may appear to us, as if we pre&s;umed to think them unworthy Jehovah's atten|tion, they were minutely marked out by his expre&s;s fore-ordination. A hair cannot fall to the ground; or any creature from the &s;erpent, that licks the du&s;t, up to the exalted &s;eraph before the cele&s;tial throne, move his body unob&s;erved by him, who&s;e eyes are like a flame of fire. Hence, if you are comfortably connected with pious re|lations, or, if otherwi&s;e, the di&s;pen&s;ation
<PB N="7" REF="026576_0007_0FD0AC5B320EAAB0">is of your <HI>Father in heaven,</HI> who is a God of righteous judgment, as well as tender mercy, and had the wi&s;e&s;t rea&s;ons for or|dering it &s;o! How affecting the con&s;ider|ation, that per&s;ons, however nearly and intimately related in one family, are &s;oon to be &s;eparated! Such relations mu&s;t, in the nature of things, be &s;hort-lived. If not &s;u&s;pended by &s;ome providential incidents, which &s;eparate the &s;ons of a father, order|ing the lot of one, in one place, of another, in another place, death &s;hall, ere long, di&s;|&s;olve them; and then is the &s;ervant eter|nally free from his ma&s;ter. How u&s;eful is it to read often and carefully in the vo|lume of divine providence! <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord.</HI> How tran&s;ient is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things? Where are many families, on which the &s;un of pro&s;perity once &s;hone with meridian effulgence? Wherefore &s;hould the pro&s;perous, in a worldly view, be ela|ed? Wherefore &s;hould the afflicted be de|&s;pondent? Has not this con&s;ideration a tendency to enforce dome&s;tic religion; for, as you are &s;oon to be &s;eparated, &s;hould not this induce you to be cordial and active in the &s;ervice of God?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026576_0008_0FD0AC5CADD4FC88">
SECOND, We will not, either as indivi|duals, or as families, &s;erve God aright, till he, by his Spirit and grace, incline and di&s;po&s;e us for our duty.</P>
<P>Where is the &s;ociety, all the members of which wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit, and in truth? In how many hou&s;es is the Bible never read but to be turned into bur|le&s;que? Is it unlawful for a Mahometan to touch his alcoran with unwa&s;hen hands? Is <HI>their</HI> veneration for that &s;y&s;tem of lies, invented by the ea&s;tern impo&s;tor, &s;uch? Blu&s;h, Chri&s;tians! blu&s;h and be a|&s;hamed. In how many hou&s;es are all the &s;ecret and &s;ocial duties of religion totally neglected? Alas! the natural part of the human heart is <HI>evil, only evil,</HI> and that <HI>con|tinually.</HI> How many are there, who, if &s;ome afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation of divine provi|dence, on account of which their animal &s;pirits are depre&s;&s;ed, does not force them to their duty, lie down, in the evening, and ri&s;e, in the morning, as though their knees were jointle&s;s and their &s;inews bra&s;s? What is the rea&s;on that we can receive our &s;tated meals without &s;o much as acknowledging our bounteous benefactor? Or what is the rea&s;on that we implore a heavenly ble&s;&s;ing on one meal, not on another? Are not all
<PB N="9" REF="026576_0009_0FD0AC5E2E649A28">equally the gift of God? Why are many fa|milies not more regular, e&s;pecially on the fir&s;t day of the week? Is it lawful to give, or to receive vi&s;its from our irreligious ac|quaintance and friends on that day? In the 12th chap. of Zechariah, we read of every fa|mily mourning for their &s;ins apart, the fa|mily of David, the family of Nathan, the family of Levi, the family of Shemei, <HI>each apart;</HI> and, if it be proper to fa&s;t in a &s;oli|tary way, why not &s;eque&s;trate our&s;elves on the fir&s;t day of the week? Why is our conver&s;ation not more &s;piritual; not more in heaven, <HI>whence we look for the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> Whether have political news, and foreign intelli|gence, re&s;pecting the nations of this world; or whether have the good news, the glad|&s;ome tidings of &s;alvation a greater ten|dency to &s;anctify the Sabbath? How were the di&s;ciples, going to Emmaus, employ|ed on the fir&s;t day of the week? Did they not talk together of all things, relating to the Redeemer, which had taken place at Jeru&s;alem? And, te&s;tifying his approba|tion of their exerci&s;es, did he not draw nigh to them? After he left them, they &s;aid, <HI>Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026576_0010_0FD0AC656E8996E8">
THIRD, The duties of family religion are of the <HI>&s;tated,</HI> not of the <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> kind.</P>
<P>Fa&s;ting, under the New Te&s;tament, is an occa&s;ional duty to be ob&s;erved ju&s;t as circum&s;tances require. The duties, of which I am &s;peaking, are rather &s;tated and ordinary. There are, no doubt, &s;ea&s;ons, in which e&s;pecially, there is a loud call to them. Such is the &s;ea&s;on of adver&s;ity; for, &s;ays God, <HI>I will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offences, and &s;eek my face; in their affliction they will &s;eek me early.</HI> But is not <HI>the voice of thank&s;giv|ing heard</HI> &s;tatedly <HI>in the tabernacles of the righteous?</HI> How good is it <HI>to &s;how forth his loving kindne&s;s in the morning, and his faith|fulne&s;s every night;</HI> pre&s;enting on the altar of a willing heart a gratulatory &s;acrifice to the gracious hearer of prayer! When we read of the daily &s;acrifice, which was offered by the pious Jews, why is the time, at which it was offered, mentioned in the New Te&s;tament, if not to &s;how that it was divinely intended to be a pattern to individuals, and to families in all &s;uc|ceeding ages? It is called <HI>the hour</HI> of pray|er. <HI>Peter and John,</HI> we are informed in the third of the Acts, <HI>went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being
<PB N="11" REF="026576_0011_0FD0AC68951CEC28">the ninth hour.</HI> If we divide the day into twelve hours, beginning at &s;ix in the morn|ing, the ninth hour an&s;wers to three in the afternoon; the time when the even|ing &s;acrifice was offered, and the pious Jews went to the temple to be engaged in devotional exerci&s;es. Should not the Chri&s;tian's habitation be a <HI>Bethel,</HI> a hou&s;e of God, a little church, in which the head of the family pre&s;ides as the prie&s;t? Before the commencement of the Levitical prie&s;t|hood in the per&s;on of Aaron, fathers, el|der brothers, princes, or every man for him&s;elf offered &s;acrifice; which is evident in the ca&s;e of Abel, of Noah, of Abram, I&s;aac, Job, and other. In the New Te&s;ta|ment, in which the name, <HI>church,</HI> is to be variou&s;ly under&s;tood, we frequently read of a church in a particular hou&s;e. One rea&s;on is, the regularity, the order ob&s;erv|ed in it. The church is called, <HI>the hou&s;e of prayer.</HI> In her the Head has appointed a beautiful order, which is not to be chan|ged. It is our duty to <HI>walk about Zion, and go round about her;</HI> to <HI>tell the towers thereof; to mark her bulwarks;</HI> to <HI>con&s;ider her palaces.</HI> In a manner equally expre&s;s, he has re|quired the families of I&s;rael to wor&s;hip him. Con&s;idering this, <HI>I be&s;eech you, bre|thren, by the mercies of God that ye pre&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="026576_0012_0FD0AC69719469D0">your bodies, a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P>FOURTH, As families, we have many mercies to acknowledge, and many &s;ins to confe&s;s.</P>
<P>Do not mi&s;take me. I do not mean that dome&s;tic religion &s;uper&s;edes per&s;onal de|votion. No. Each of us has many per&s;on|al mercies to acknowledge. There is not a hair on our heads that we can call our own. Each has many per&s;onal &s;ins to confe&s;s. It is recorded of a famous mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, that he never &s;aw a criminal going to the place of execution, but he &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, and exclaimed, <HI>the &s;ame evil is here!</HI> Why &s;hould we not, in a &s;ocial manner, acknowledge our divine benefac|tor as the giver of all good? Commenda|ble was the conduct of Jacob. Te&s;tifying his gratitude to his divine deliverer, he made an altar, in Bethel, unto God, who <HI>an&s;wered</HI> him <HI>in the day of his di&s;tre&s;s, and was with him in the way, which he went.</HI> He commanded his hou&s;ehold to <HI>put away &s;trange Gods</HI> that were among them; to <HI>change their garments;</HI> to <HI>be clean;</HI> and to concur with him in expre&s;&s;ions of grati|tude. How readily did they comply! <HI>They
<PB N="13" REF="026576_0013_0FD0AC6E6FFACA88">gave unto Jacob all the &s;trange gods that were in their hand, and all their ear-rings, which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. What,</HI> my brethren, <HI>&s;hall</HI> we <HI>render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards us?</HI> Man is a &s;ocial creature. He was originally intended for &s;ociety, and fitted for it. Various are the views, in which reciprocal advantages re|&s;ult from &s;ocial connections. Society is a chain of many links. With tender care, the parents rear up the children; and the children, when pious example and educa|tion are ble&s;&s;ed, as the means of &s;oftening, and forming their hearts, are a comfort to the parents. The &s;ervant cannot be without the ma&s;ter, more than the ma&s;ter can be without the &s;ervant. Ah! how many family &s;ins have we to confe&s;s! How often have the members of tho&s;e lit|tle &s;ocieties offended again&s;t each other? Are not hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, ma&s;ters and &s;ervants culpable, very culpable for neglecting the duties of their re&s;pective &s;tations? In very expre&s;&s;ive terms, did holy David lament both the ir|religion and the adver&s;ity of his family. <HI>Although my hou&s;e be not &s;o with God; yet he hath made with me an everla&s;ting covenant, ordered in all things and &s;ure; for this is all
<PB N="14" REF="026576_0014_0FD0AC7045B3C338">my &s;alvation, and all my de&s;ire, although he make it not to grow.</HI></P>
<P>FIFTH, Family religion comes recom|mended to us by the example of the mo&s;t eminent believers, who lived in both ear|lier and later times.</P>
<P>Are we not commanded to be followers of them, who have gone before us, and now inherit the promi&s;es; to walk in the good old path, in which our pious fathers walked? Says the Redeemer to the church, <HI>If thou knowe&s;t not, O thou faire&s;t among wo|men, go thy way forth by the foot&s;teps of the flock, and feed thy kids be&s;ide the &s;hepherds tents.</HI> When Jo&s;hua &s;aid, <HI>as for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord,</HI> was he the only per&s;on who ever formed this re|&s;olution? By no means. A luminous cloud of witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our view. Let me remind you of Abram, the father of the faithful, and the friend of God, who&s;e faith and obedience are fa|mous in every age; for he has exhibited to mankind a noble pattern of heavenly gra|ces, and virtues. Said the Searcher of hearts concerning him, <HI>I know him, that he will command his children, and his hou&s;e hold after him; and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment; that
<PB N="15" REF="026576_0015_0FD07F76F9CB70D0">the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath &s;poken of him.</HI> This honorable te&s;|timony was given by One, who cannot be deceived by any &s;pecious appearance, or crafty affectation of zeal. I call it an <HI>honor|able</HI> te&s;timony. "I know Abram, that his re&s;pect for my authority; and his love to my laws, will induce him to command his hou&s;ehold to &s;erve me; not only the &s;tated members of his family, but al&s;o every &s;o|journer under his roof." How prai&s;e|worthy is David's re&s;olution; who &s;aid, <HI>I will walk within my hou&s;e with a perfect heart!</HI> A holy life is emphatically expre&s;|&s;ed by walking with God. Enoch, who was tran&s;lated that he &s;hould not &s;ee death, walked with him. The phra&s;e be|&s;peaks a holy familiary betwixt God and his people, which words are inadequate to expre&s;s. As if the man according to God's own heart had &s;aid, "In the &s;trength of grace, which is made perfect in our weak|ne&s;s, I re&s;olve to &s;et a proper example be|fore my family by my pious conduct, con&s;cientiou&s;ly performing the duties, which are incumbent upon me as the head of it." But, &s;ay you, "The&s;e are Old Te&s;|tament examples. What examples are there in the New?" The mo&s;t illu&s;trious in&s;tance that could be mentioned is Je&s;us
<PB N="16" REF="026576_0016_0FD0AC7387186BE8">him&s;elf, who has left us an example that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps. He was a fa|ther to his di&s;ciples, praying with them like a pious father with his children. We read of a Cornelius, who feared God with all his hou&s;e; that is, I &s;up|po&s;e, his family joined cordially in Jeho|vah's wor&s;hip, with the devout centurion at their head. Says the Apo&s;tle, in the la&s;t chapter of his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Co|rinthians, <HI>Aquila and Pri&s;cilla &s;alute you much in the Lord,</HI> WITH THE CHURCH THAT IS IN THEIR HOUSE; in the la&s;t chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, <HI>Salute the brethren, which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas,</HI> and THE CHURCH, WHICH IS IN HIS HOUSE; and, in the &s;econd ver&s;e of his epi&s;tle to Philemon, <HI>to our be|loved Apphia, and Archippus, our fellow-&s;ol|dier,</HI> AND TO THE CHURCH IN THY HOUSE. It has, indeed, been queried what is to be under&s;tood by a church in a particular hou&s;e; whether the a&s;&s;embling of the church, which, in tho&s;e troublous times, might meet for public wor&s;hip in it; or a private &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, joining together in the duties of &s;ocial prayer, and &s;piritual conver&s;ation; or the members of the family uniting in the ex|erci&s;es of dome&s;tic devotion. This la&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="026576_0017_0FD0AC74CF1294E0">interpretation is adopted by not a few ju|dicious expo&s;itors, and &s;eems the mo&s;t pro|bable. To the honour of the jailor, who was made to exclaim, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> it is recorded, that he <HI>rejoiced, be|lieving in God with all his hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>SIXTH, Family wor&s;hip is one of the means, by which our Father in heaven is plea&s;ed to manife&s;t him&s;elf to his people.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration endears it to the &s;aints, who, with joy un&s;peakable, <HI>draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation.</HI> What are the ordinances in general, but meeting-places, as it were, betwixt God and his people? If we wi&s;h to find him, we mu&s;t go into the <HI>Galilees,</HI> where he has ap|pointed to meet with us. Why &s;hould we not embrace every opportunity of hold|ing communion with our God? The church tells us, &s;he <HI>&s;ought her beloved, but found him not.</HI> Did &s;he, after the fir&s;t di&s;appointment, relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uit? No. Per&s;everance was nece&s;&s;ary. Not having found her beloved in the &s;treets, and in the broad ways of the city, &s;he ap|plied to the watchmen, &s;aying, <HI>&s;aw ye him whom my &s;oul loveth?</HI> They, it appears, gave her no &s;atisfaction. But, adds &s;he, <HI>It was but a little that I pa&s;&s;ed from them, but
<PB N="18" REF="026576_0018_0FD0AC7689C01418">I found him whom my &s;oul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's hou&s;e, and into the cham|bers of her that conceived me.</HI> This plainly teaches that God's people, &s;ometimes, find him in &s;ecret and private, after their ex|pectations of meeting with him, inpublic, have been di&s;appointed. We read of an impotent man, lying at the pool, called <HI>Bethe&s;da, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years;</HI> and, after all, was made whole. Pre&s;umption and de&s;pondency are dangerous extremes.</P>
<P>SEVENTH, Families are encouraged to wor&s;hip God from the con&s;ideration that many promi&s;es are &s;uited to their ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Has he not promi&s;ed his gracious pre|&s;ence in <HI>the dwellings of Jacob,</HI> as well as in <HI>the gates of Zion;</HI> though he loves the one more than the other? Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's words have been ju&s;tly accommo|dated to the &s;ituation of a family begin|ning to perform &s;ocial wor&s;hip, when he &s;ays, <HI>If two of you &s;hall agree, as touching a|ny thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall he done for them of my Father, who is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</HI> How animating is the following promi&s;e;
<PB N="19" REF="026576_0019_0FD0AC7844742300">which has, I &s;uppo&s;e, a primary view to the return of the Jews from their Baby|lonian captivity; but has a running ap|plicability, and a continued accompli&s;h|ment, e&s;pecially in the New Te&s;tament times! <HI>At the &s;ame time &s;aith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of I&s;rael, and they &s;hall be my people.</HI> Says he, in another part of &s;cripture, <HI>In all places, where I re|cord my name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble&s;s thee;</HI> and is not his name record|ed in our habitations?</P>
<P>FINALLY, The neglect of family reli|gion is awfully threatened in the word of God.</P>
<P>What an alarming imprecation is the prophet's! <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the Hea|then that know thee not,</HI> AND UPON THE FAMILIES THAT CALL NOT UPON THY NAME. In &s;cripture the name, <HI>fa|mily,</HI> is, I know, ambiguous, and different|ly under&s;tood. But, admitting this, the prohet's words apply, in their full force, to the &s;ubject under review. Families, which neglect the wor&s;hip of Jehovah, and Heathens are properly joined toge|ther, for, though the former be <HI>profe&s;&s;ed|ly</HI> Chri&s;tian, they are <HI>practically</HI> Heathen families. Hence they are objects of the
<PB N="20" REF="026576_0020_0FD0AC7A0EF15528">divine di&s;plea&s;ure. The word, <HI>fury,</HI> be|&s;peaks an awful degree of di&s;plea&s;ure, e|ven indignation; the phra&s;e, <HI>pour out,</HI> the tremendous manner in which it is execut|ed. What aggravates their &s;in, and height|ens their mi&s;ery is their knowledge of their duty, while they do not perform it; for, when it is &s;aid, <HI>the Heathen that know thee not,</HI> it evidently implies that tho&s;e fa|milies knew their duty, yet did not wor|&s;hip the God of their fathers. Sinners! &s;tand agha&s;t! Does any hear of the wrath of Almighty God, and his ears not tingle? What! does a family profe&s;s to be Chri&s;|tian, in which there is not a ve&s;tige of the Chri&s;tian religion? Tell it not in Gath. Publi&s;h it not in A&s;kelon; le&s;t the uncir|cumci&s;ed Phili&s;tines triumph.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE,</P>
<P>FIRST, Does not rea&s;on, not to mention revalation, teach the obligation, the im|portance, and the utility of family religion. Does not rea&s;on teach us to repay a gener|ous benefactor with gratitude? Is not a grateful return of Jehovah's mercies all the return we can make for them; all the return he requires? and why not <HI>render him the calves of our lips?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="026576_0021_0FD0AC7C394B7EE8">
SECOND, The non-performance of the duties of religion is incon&s;i&s;tent with a gra|cious &s;tate; and they, who neglect them, mu&s;t unque&s;tionably be in the gall of bit|terne&s;s, and bond of iniquity. A grace|le&s;s man <HI>may,</HI> but a gracious per&s;on <HI>mu&s;t</HI> perform the&s;e duties; for is not prayer the breath of the new creature? and can we live without breathing? <HI>Behold he,</HI> that is, the new creature, as &s;oon as he be|gins to live, <HI>prayeth!</HI> Con&s;ider al&s;o that one of the views, by which our &s;anctifica|tion is de&s;cribed, is by writing the law on the heart. <HI>This is the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael after tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people.</HI> Hence, if the divine law be engraved on a man's heart, will he not &s;tudy to tran&s;cribe it in his life, and con|ver&s;ation? If per&s;ons be in a graci|ous &s;tate, are not faith in the Redeemer for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for the acceptance of both their per&s;ons, and their &s;ervices, and love to him, as a Sovereign, as well as a Saviour, powerful principles impelling them to perform the&s;e duties, by which they &s;hew their re&s;pect for the divine au|thority. The authority of Je&s;us commands,
<PB N="22" REF="026576_0022_0FD0AC7C494006D8">his love &s;weetly con&s;trains us to walk in his ways.</P>
<P>THIRD, Is Jo&s;hua's <HI>your</HI> re&s;olution? Be not a&s;hamed, brethren, of being religious; or, if your religion is yet to begin, be per&s;uaded now to leave the path, in which de&s;troyers go. <HI>Come with us,</HI> &s;aid Mo|&s;es to Hobab, <HI>and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath &s;poken good concerning I&s;|rael.</HI> We are accountabe creatures; and the day of our death, when we mu&s;t an|&s;wer for all the deeds done in the body, is approaching, with rapid, though &s;ilent &s;teps. MASTERS! You have a &s;olemn charge of the &s;ouls of your &s;ervants; &s;uch a charge as a mini&s;ter has of his people. What an eternal di&s;grace is it to the Chri|&s;tian name for the head of a family to o|verlook the morals, and religious in&s;truc|tion of any under his roof? What! have not per&s;ons, in inferior &s;tations of life, &s;ouls to be &s;aved or damned, to he happy or mi&s;erable for ever? It matters not whether they be <HI>black,</HI> or <HI>white</HI> men; for, <HI>as men,</HI> the po&s;terity of Ham, are on a perfect e|quality with other de&s;criptions of the hu|man race. It was Cain, that primeval mo|nument of fratricide! who &s;aid, <HI>Am I my brother's keeper?</HI> Nor a few who now &s;ur|round
<PB N="23" REF="026576_0023_0FD0AC7DC81DA300">the cele&s;tial throne, have for a ground of thankfulne&s;s, and a note, in their ec&s;tatical &s;ong, that the God, who &s;aved them, ordered their lot in a pi|ous family, where example, which is, of|ten, more powerful than precept, made a good, a permanent impre&s;&s;ion on their minds. PARENTS! <HI>Bring up your children in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord.</HI> They are the hope of the church; for fa|milies are nur&s;eries, in which young ones are rai&s;ed up, and prepared for u&s;efulne&s;s in public life. Be careful that the &s;tream be not poi&s;oned at the fountain-head. It is ea&s;ie&s;t to bend the twig when it is green. Impre&s;&s;ions made in early life are, with dif|ficulty, if ever eradicated. It is dangerous not to rai&s;e up a &s;piritual &s;eed to the Re|deemer. Do you not wi&s;h your children to &s;erve him after you have gone to your fathers, and &s;leep in the du&s;t? A pious e|ducation is the be&s;t e&s;tate you can give them. It has often been remarked by practical writers, on this &s;ubject, that both defection and reformation in religion com|monly begin <HI>in families.</HI> It is an ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e that a parent can be righly ex|erci&s;ed about the intere&s;ts of his own &s;oul, if he has not the &s;alvation of his children at heart. The Father of mercies does not
<PB N="24" REF="026576_0024_0FD0AC7F6541DB68">always an&s;wer the prayers of pious pa|rents, on behalf of their children, <HI>when</HI> they are pre&s;ented to him; &s;ometimes not before the parents have gone to the eternal world. Many &s;uch prayers, we have rea&s;on to believe, lodged at the throne of grace, are yet unan&s;wered; but will be punctually attended to, at the pro|per time.</P>
<P>UPON THE WHOLE, Had I a thou&s;and mouths, and a thou&s;and tongues, I would employ them in recommending the Re|deemer's &s;ervice to you all; old and young. <HI>Chu&s;e ye, this day, whom ye will &s;erve.</HI> Said Elijah to the people, when the competition was betwixt him and Baal, <HI>if the Lord be God, follow him; but, if Baal,</HI> who, when his deluded votaries call upon him, is either deaf or on a journey, <HI>follow him.</HI> How ho|norable, how ea&s;y, how delightful is the Redeemer's &s;ervice! <HI>Wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace.</HI> Then <HI>give no &s;leep to your eyes, nor &s;lumber to your eye-lids, until you find a place for the Lord, an habitation for the God of Jacob.</HI></P>
