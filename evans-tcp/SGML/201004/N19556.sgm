<HEAD>TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 11th of December, 1792, about one o'clock, the mayor and &s;ecretary went up into the apartment of the late king, and &s;aid to him, "I am charged to declare to you, that the Convention wait for you at their bar, and I am appointed to conduct you." The &s;ecretary then read the&s;e words, "Decree of the National Convention, of the 6th of De|cember: Art. 5. Louis Capet &s;hall be brought to the bar of the National Convention on Tue&s;day the 11th, to an&s;wer the que&s;tions which &s;hall be put to him by the pre&s;ident." This being done, the mayor a&s;ked him if he would go down, he appeared to he&s;itate a little, and &s;aid, "My name is not Louis Capet; my ance&s;tors bore that name, but I never was called &s;o; it is however like all the treatment I have expe|rienced the&s;e four months pa&s;t by force. This morning my &s;on has been &s;eparated from me; it was an enjoyment of which they have deprived me. I have been expecting you the&s;e three hours</P>
<P>The mayor, without making any an&s;wer, invited him again to go down, which he determined at length to do. Being in the carriage, which was lined with thick cu&s;hions, in order to be mu&s;ket proof, he kept &s;ilence all the way, till the carri|age was &s;topped by &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding among the guards who e&s;corted him on the Boulevards.</P>
<P>He arrived at the Convention about two o'clock. He did not &s;eem at all troubled. The mayor and attorney-general were on each &s;ide of him; behind him were Santerre, Ber|ruyer and other officers.</P>
<P>The &s;itting of the Convention commenced by reading the act of accu&s;ation again&s;t Louis XVI, which was pre&s;ented by Barbaroux in the name of the commi&s;&s;ion of twenty one. It contained an enumeration of the principal charges made a|gain&s;t the unfortunate monarch; and each charge was fol|lowed by a li&s;t of the pieces on which the proofs are to be founded. When it was read, &s;everal new charges were
<PB N="6" REF="025499_0004_0FCDEC04DE8DFDB0">
propo&s;ed by &s;everal of the members, and &s;ome which appeared to have little weight, or to be ill founded, were expunged.</P>
<P>The famous Marat voluntarily became the defender of Louis, by reque&s;ting that all tho&s;e charges alluding to crimes committed before his acceptance of the con&s;titution, &s;hould be omitted in the act of accu&s;ation. He &s;poke al&s;o of the amne&s;ty which followed the acceptance, but the Convention paid no attention to his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The Convention decreed, that the act of accu&s;ation &s;hould &s;erve as the ground of tho&s;e que&s;tions which were to be put to the king, and that after each que&s;tion the pre&s;ident &s;hould &s;ay to him, <HI>What have you to an&s;wer?</HI> The pre&s;ident was al&s;o authori&s;ed to propo&s;e &s;uch que&s;tions as might ari&s;e from the king's an&s;wers, and to make him &s;it down at the bar.</P>
<P>Barrere, the pre&s;ident, informed the Convention that Louis was at the door, and reque&s;ted the repre&s;entatives of the people to a&s;&s;ume a dignity worthy of the grandeur of their functions. He reminded them, that they formed a tribunal on which the eyes of Europe were fixed, and who&s;e &s;entence would be judged by po&s;terity. He forbade them to &s;how any &s;igns either of approbation or di&s;approbation, and de&s;ired them to remember the coolne&s;s and &s;ilent dignity with which they received the king after his return from Varennes.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t two Santerre informed the Convention that Louis was arrived, and was waiting the orders of the a&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident gave the order to introduce him. A mo&s;t profound &s;ilence reigned in the hall. Louis appeared at the bar, attended by two municipal officers.</P>
<P>When Louis appeared at the bar, the pre&s;ident mentioned to him the decree by which the Convention e&s;tabli&s;hed a tribunal to try him. Maillie, one of the &s;ecretaries, read the act of accu&s;ation, charge by charge, and at each the pre&s;ident a&s;ked the king what he had to &s;ay in his own de|fence. Louis contented him&s;elf with giving an&s;wers to each que&s;tion in a few words, he made no &s;peech, and did not, like Charles J. of England, deny the authority of the Con|vention to try him. He a&s;ked for copies of the act of accu|&s;ation, of the pieces which are to &s;erve as proofs, and of his
<PB N="7" REF="025499_0005_0FCDEC061130F0A0">
own examination, of which the following is a true copy; he al&s;o reque&s;ted that he might be allowed coun&s;el.</P>

<P>&mdash;Louis! the French nation accu&s;es you. The national a&s;&s;embly decreed on the 3d of December that you &s;hould be tried by them; and on the 6th, that you &s;hould be brought to the bar, to hear the accu&s;ation read, and to give your an&s;wers.</P>

<P>Louis, the French people accu&s;e you of having plotted and formed a multitude of con&s;piracies to e&s;tabli&s;h tyranny in de&s;troying liberty. On the 10th of June, 1789, you made an attack on the &s;overeignty of the nation, by &s;u&s;|pending their repre&s;entatives, and by expelling them with violence from the place of their meeting.</P>

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>Citizens, repre&s;entatives of the nation:</P>
<P>THE moment is at length arrived, in which Louis, ac|cu&s;ed in the name of the French nation, and &s;urrounded by the coun&s;el which humanity and the laws have granted him, is about to pre&s;ent his ju&s;tification. Even by the &s;ilence which &s;urrounds me, I am informed that the day of ju&s;tice has &s;uc|ceeded to the aera of prejudice.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of kings are &s;omewhat more tenderly impre&s;&s;ive, and more &s;acred, than the misfortunes of other men; even he, who but lately filled the mo&s;t brilliant throne in the univer&s;e, mu&s;t excite a more powerful intere&s;t. You have called him among you; he is come, calmly, with dig|nity, &s;trong in his innocence, &s;upported by the te&s;timony of his whole life. He has revealed to you even his thoughts,
<PB N="11" REF="025499_0009_0FCDEC0F134A2028">
in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, without preparation, without examination, ac|cu&s;ations which he could not fore&s;ee, making, if I may &s;o &s;ay, an extempore defence.</P>
<P>Louis could only &s;ay that he was innocent; I come to prove it to you, I bring the demon&s;trations. I could wi&s;h this &s;pace were &s;o enlarged that the multitude of citizens, who have received the mo&s;t baneful impre&s;&s;ions to the pre|judice of Louis, &s;hould now feel tho&s;e of a different tendency. Louis knows that Europe expects with anxiety the &s;entence you are now to pa&s;s. He knows that po&s;terity will &s;ome day examine it;&mdash;he knows it, but he con&s;iders only his cotemporaries. With him we forget po&s;terity, and view only the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>Had I judges only to an&s;wer, I would content my&s;elf with &s;aying, that &s;ince the nation has aboli&s;hed royalty, there can be no &s;entence to pronounce again&s;t Louis; but I &s;peak to the people. I have to examine the affair under two points of view, that in which Louis was placed before his accep|tance, and that in which he &s;tands &s;ince his acceptance of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In entering on this bu&s;ine&s;s, I fir&s;t meet with the decree which pronounces that Louis &s;hall be tried by the con&s;titution. Apparently the legi&s;lators, &s;aid Louis, cannot bring forward this inviolability. What then have you done by your de|cree? you have con&s;tituted your&s;elves <HI>judges</HI> of the accu&s;a|tion which you make your&s;elves.</P>
<P>You have decreed, that Louis &s;hall be heard. If then he ought to be heard, he has the right to defend him&s;elf. It does not depend on the judge to circum&s;cribe the means&punc; the convention &s;hall weigh them when he &s;hall have brought them forward. If Louis be mi&s;taken, let them refute his errors.</P>
<P>Nations are &s;overeign: they are free to give them&s;elves &s;uch forms of government as they plea&s;e. I will not di&s;pute this principle; and it is not forgotten that the efforts of one of the advocates of Louis contributed to in&s;ert this principle in the con&s;titution. But the nation cannot it&s;elf exerci&s;e &s;o|vereignty, it is nece&s;&s;ary the exerci&s;e of it &s;hould be dele|gated.</P>
<P>In 1789 the nation de&s;ired a monarchial government; a monarchial government required the inviolability of its chief;
<PB N="12" REF="025499_0010_0FCDEC12ADFA2828">
it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould impre&s;s that re&s;pect which renders amiable the obedience that the law commands. The character of this inviolability has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it has been pretended that it was not a contract of reciprocity, but this delegation was a contract &s;o long as it was not revoked. It is a mandate if you plea&s;e, but the mandatory could not &s;ub|mit to other conditions and other penalties than tho&s;e impo&s;ed in the mandate.</P>
<P>I open the con&s;titution at Chapter II. <HI>of royalty,</HI> and I &s;ee that the per&s;on of the king is inviolable; there is no excepti|on, no modification, but there are circum&s;tances in which we lo&s;e the character of inviolability.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Art. V. of Section I. Chap. 2. of Title 3. "If the king have not made oath, or if, after having made it, he retract it, he &s;hall be con&s;idered as having abdicated royalty."</P>
<P>The nation here impo&s;es on the king the duty of taking an oath: to retract his oath is a crime again&s;t the nation. The nation has fore&s;een this crime, and has enacted its penalty; it is not a dethronement&mdash;the word is not pronounced once, it is only a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the king &s;hall be pre&s;umed to have abdicated royalty. You &s;ee that the con&s;titution cre|ates no tribunal, that it does not &s;peak of trial, and that it mentions no word of dethronement.</P>
<P>But without retracting his oath, he could betray it; he might favour ho&s;tile and criminal enterpri&s;es again&s;t the &s;tate &mdash;the con&s;titution has again fore&s;een this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Art. VI. "If the king put him&s;elf at the head of an ar|my, and direct its force again&s;t the nation; or if he do not oppo&s;e, by a formal act, any &s;uch enterprize, which may be executed in his name, he &s;hall be con&s;idered as having abdi|cated royalty."</P>
<P>I de&s;ire that you will weigh well the character of the of|fence&punc; provided again&s;t by this article. There cannot exi&s;t one more criminal. It &s;uppo&s;es all the machinations, all the perfidies, all the trea&s;ons, every horror, every &s;courge, every calamity of a bloody and inte&s;tine war, and yet what does the con&s;titution pronounce? The pre&s;umption of having ab|dicated royalty.</P>
<P>Art. VII. "If the king, being gone out of the kingdom,
<PB N="13" REF="025499_0011_0FCDEC145320E960">
does not return after the invitation made to him by the le|gi&s;lative body."</P>
<P>What does the con&s;titution pronuunce again? The pre|&s;umption of his having abdicated royalty.</P>
<P>Article VIII. &s;ays, "that after the expre&s;s or legal abdi|cation, the king &s;hall be tried as other citizens for all crimes committed po&s;terior to his abdication." It re&s;ults then that the king had a particular exi&s;tence ab&s;olutely different from that of other citizens; and from whence did he derive this particular privileged exi&s;tence, if not from the law, which had impre&s;&s;ed upon him the character of inviolability, which he could not lo&s;e, but by his expre&s;s and legal abdication. And it is from the mo&s;t attrocious crime that a king can com|mit again&s;t a nation, that it &s;uppo&s;es him returned to the citizens. In other re&s;pects the law is perfectly equal between the legi&s;lative body and the king:&mdash;the legi&s;lative body might al&s;o betray the nation, it might &s;eize the national &s;o|vereignty; the nation had a right to pronounce a penalty again&s;t the deputies, and yet none has been pronounced.</P>
<P>Louis is accu&s;ed, he is accu&s;ed in the name of the nation, he is accu&s;ed of various crimes. But the&s;e crimes are provi|ded for by the con&s;titutional act, and then the penalty ought to be applied&mdash;or they are not, and then there exi&s;ts no pe|nalty applicable to them.</P>
<P>I go farther, I &s;ay that they are provided again&s;t, the con&s;titution has fore&s;een the mo&s;t atrocious of them all, that of a criminal war again&s;t the nation. In whatever manner this article may be under&s;tood, the crimes are there, they are there.&mdash;Well! the law declares only a pre&s;umption of the abdication of royalty. I well know, that now the nation has aboli&s;hed kingly power, the penalty can be no longer ap|plied&mdash;but could it change the fate of Louis? Has he not the right to &s;ay, "when the con&s;titution was accepted, I was the pri&s;oner of the nation, why did you not try me? You have aboli&s;hed royalty, I do not conte&s;t your right. But becau&s;e you have aboli&s;hed royalty, will you puni&s;h me, and becau&s;e you know no law you can apply to me, will you create one for the purpo&s;e&mdash;for me alone? You have all the powers, doubtle&s;&s;ly: but one power you have not, that of being unju&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that Louis was: be tried as an enemy.
<PB N="14" REF="025499_0012_0FCDEC15D0B6C730">
But is he not a cruel enemy who would put him&s;elf at the head of an army again&s;t the nation.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid he was only inviolable for individual citi|zens. According to this principle, the repre&s;entatives of the people would no longer be inviolable to the people for every thing they have done, &s;aid, or written, during their &s;e&s;&s;ion? I read in Rou&s;&s;eau&mdash;<HI>"Where I &s;ee neither the law which pro|&s;ecutes, nor the law which condemns, I will not appeal to the ge|neral will, for the general will cannot pronounce, as a general will, on any man, nor on any facts."</HI></P>
<P>If you deprive Louis of the right of inviolability as a king, you cannot deprive him of the right of trial as a citizen. And in the la&s;t ca&s;e, I demand of you where are all the forms of pre&s;ervation? Where are the juries, tho&s;e ho&s;tages for the lives and honour of citizens? I demand where is the propor|tion of &s;uffrages which the law has &s;o wi&s;ely e&s;tabli&s;hed? Where is the &s;ilent ballot, which inclo&s;es in the &s;ame urn the opinion and the con&s;cience of the judge? I &s;peak to you with the plainne&s;s of a freeman. I look among you for jud|ges, I &s;ee none but accu&s;ers. You will pronounce upon Louis, and you have accu&s;ed him! You will pronounce upon Louis, and you have declared your wi&s;h re&s;pecting him! You will pronounce upon Louis, and your opinions are &s;pread over Europe!</P>
<P>I &s;hall here take the act of accu&s;ation&mdash;I ob&s;erve you go back to the 20th of July, 1789. I go back al&s;o. But how could you accu&s;e him of having wi&s;hed at this aera to di&s;&s;olve the a&s;&s;embly. Do you forget, that it was he who convened it? Do you forget, that for more than 150 years, princes, more zealous than him of their authority, had con&s;tantly re|&s;i&s;ted their convocation? Do you forget, that without him, without the numerous &s;acrifices to which he con&s;ented, you would not be deliberating here this day on the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate? He is reproached with having drawn troops round Paris, but I could &s;ay that the&s;e troops were intended for the protection of Paris again&s;t di&s;turbers. I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee the order when I was employed to defend the command|ant of the&s;e troops, whom the nation did not he&s;itate to acquit.</P>
<P>I will not &s;peak here of the memorial in which Talon is mentioned as acting a part again&s;t the revolution, nor the
<PB N="15" REF="025499_0013_0FCDEC17530AD8F0">
papers annexed to this memorial. If I had to defend an ordinary client, I would &s;ay, that a citizen can never be tried upon papers found by the inva&s;ion of his hou&s;e, without being previou&s;ly inventoried or &s;ealed.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Louis was invaded, his che&s;ts broken, his drawers forced; no &s;eal was put on his effects, and invento|ries made; his papers may have been &s;cattered, and tho&s;e lo&s;t which &s;hould reply to what were brought again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The letters of a dead man are quoted, but are the letters of a per&s;on decea&s;ed proof? It is &s;aid that the&s;e letters &s;peak of money di&s;tributed: but if this fact, which they do not explain, be true, &s;hould it be true that they have extorted from his &s;en&s;ibility, from his benificence, &s;ums greater or le&s;s, is it not well known with what an unfortunate facility kings are circumvented and deceived. The copy of a letter to Mi|rabeau and La Fayette is &s;poken of, but the letter is not &s;ent. Mirabeau and La Fayette were at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t popular men, they both loved the con&s;titution; in this &s;cheme the good of the &s;tate was the only aim.</P>
<P>He was reproached for his letter to Bouille; here there is not even occa&s;ion for him to ju&s;tify him&s;elf&mdash;the National A&s;&s;embly had voted thanks for the conduct of Bouille.</P>
<P>You have reproached him with the a&s;&s;emblies of people on the 28th February, but popular rumours had drawn to the palace men of warm tempers, and Louis had ordered them to quit their arms.</P>
<P>You have accu&s;ed him of the ma&s;&s;acres at the Champ de Mars; but do you then forget that the unhappy prince was &s;u&s;pended from his powers, a pri&s;oner guarded in &s;ight.</P>
<P>The nation has decreed a republic, but this was not the form of government the nation then wi&s;hed. Did not the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf declare again&s;t the republic in the month of July la&s;t? If Louis had then betrayed the intere&s;ts of the nation, or abu&s;ed its confidence, you might complain&mdash; you might &s;igh over the lot of kings, but you could not try him.</P>
<P>I have not yet pronounced the word which mu&s;t annihi|late all this chain of accu&s;ation. I have not &s;aid, that &s;ince all the&s;e events Louis has accepted the con&s;titution.&mdash;The con&s;titution was the compact between the people and the king &mdash;all mi&s;ts were then di&s;pelled&mdash;the pa&s;t was forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025499_0014_0FCDE8F64BE12EF8">Let us examine what he has done &s;ince this acceptance.</P>
<P>The act of accu&s;ation comprehends both the facts which he was not charged to an&s;wer per&s;onally, and the facts per|&s;onal to him. The con&s;titution had not required on the part the king a warranty for his agents. It had, on the other hand ordained the re&s;pon&s;ibility of mini&s;ters. No one has a right at pre&s;ent to accu&s;e the king and his mini&s;ters of the &s;ame acts.</P>
<P>Louis had been accu&s;ed of having &s;uffered the National A&s;&s;embly to remain ignorant of the convention of Pilnitz. But this convention was a &s;ecret treaty between the empe|ror and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>There was no rea&s;on of &s;tate which could render it a law to mini&s;ters to make known to an a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e delibera|tions are public, an act which was not &s;o.</P>
<P>You have reproached the unfortunate prince with having retarded a month the &s;ending a decree relative to Avignon; this, citizens, was one of the heads of accu&s;ation again&s;t the mini&s;ter Deli&s;&s;art. He had him&s;elf announced that his ju&s;ti|fication, which he was preparing in pri&s;on, would leave no doubt of his innocence. And could you, after his death bring the &s;ame accu&s;ation again&s;t the king?</P>
<P>You have reproached him with the troubles of Ni&s;mes, of Jales. Is it then for the king to be an&s;werable for all the commotions in&s;eparable from &s;o great a revolution?</P>
<P>A letter of Witgen&s;tein has been con&s;tituted a crime; all that he could do, was to give him no place after his recall. The government of Cor&s;ica has been &s;poken of, but he never had it. It has been &s;aid he had a commi&s;&s;ion in the northern army, it is impo&s;&s;ible that La Fayette had demanded it, but the letter which gave him the commi&s;&s;ion remained in the war-office.</P>
<P>He has been reproached with the account drawn up by Narbonne. I will an&s;wer with one word only&mdash;when Nar|bonne quitted the mini&s;try, the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly decreed that Narbonne took with him the regret and confidence of the nation.</P>
<P>He has been reproached with the &s;urrender of Longwy&mdash; the inhabitants were guilty. The &s;urrender of Verdun&mdash; Who then was it that appointed the celebrated commander&punc; who cho&s;e rather to die than &s;urrender, if it were not Louis&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="025499_0015_0FCDEC1A505C04D0">He is reproached with having retained the Swi&s;s guards, contrary to the con&s;titution, which forbad it.</P>
<P>Hear the facts: a decree had declared that the king &s;hould be reque&s;ted to pre&s;ent a new formation of his regiment of Swi&s;s guards, and neverthele&s;s the a&s;&s;embly had ordained that it &s;hould be continued as temporarily kept up until the aera of its formation. On the third of July the a&s;&s;embly ordered the departure of three battalions of this regiment. On the 17th the a&s;&s;embly received a letter from d'Affry, remon&s;tra|ting again&s;t the decree, and claiming the capitulations. A new decree, ordering the departure of the two battalions, and d'Affry placed between the capitulations and the decree, adre&s;&s;es and remon&s;trances to the a&s;&s;embly&mdash;they pa&s;s to the order of the day, and the battalions quit Paris.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;uch facts as may be thought to concern him per&s;onally. He was at fir&s;t attacked for not having &s;anc|tioned the decree on the prie&s;ts, and on the camp of Paris. I could &s;ay that the con&s;titution granted him a &s;anction ab&s;o|lutely free, and that &s;hould he be mi&s;taken, they could not attribute his error to him as a crime. But if a great number of citizens appeared to &s;upport this la&s;t decree, a greater number &s;eemed to re&s;i&s;t it; he thought it prudent to refu&s;e his &s;anction: but at the &s;ame time, by a wi&s;e mea&s;ure he ordered the camp at Soi&s;&s;ons, and this camp was more u&s;eful to our armies than that of Paris would have been.</P>
<P>His letter to the bi&s;hop of Clermont is oppo&s;ed to him: but it was an opinion purely religious, and anterior to his acceptance of the con&s;titution; and when he accepted it, he did not think it free from &s;pots, as even in the acceptance it&s;elf, legal reforms appear.</P>
<P>He is reprobated with having paid his guard; but the a&s;&s;embly in ordering it to be di&s;banded, had &s;aid it &s;hould be formed anew; it became therefore his ju&s;tice and humanity to pay it till it &s;hould be recompo&s;ed.</P>
<P>He has been reproached with having given a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the emigrants&mdash;with having protected by his amba&s;&s;adors the co|alition of powers. He has been reproached with his keeping a re&s;ident at the court of Vienna. I an&s;wer, that he con|&s;tantly oppo&s;ed the efforts of the emigrants&mdash;I will quote a fact: he is informed by his re&s;ident, of an attempt made by the emigrants to obtain arms and ammunition at Frankfort,
<PB N="18" REF="025499_0016_0FCDEC1D531AEE20">
and of the refu&s;al of the magi&s;trate of Frankfort, He order|ed his re&s;ident to thank the magi&s;trate of Frankfort, and to invite him to per&s;i&s;t in his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>I will venture to &s;ay, there is not a &s;ingle emigrant who has received a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. He &s;upplied the expences of his nephews, the elde&s;t was fourteen, the &s;econd only ele|ven. There exi&s;ted no law which fixed the age at which emigration was a crime&mdash;the Convention has made one&mdash;his nephews were without re&s;ources: was it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould &s;mother the &s;entiments of humanity? Becau&s;e he was a king, &s;hould he cea&s;e to be a relation? He has made pre|&s;ents to the gouvernante of his children; but &s;he had been gouvernante of his children, and had left France &s;ince 1789. Choi&s;eul Beauprie has been in Italy &s;ince 1790, and has ne|ver borne arms again&s;t France. He has given a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Rochefort, but Rochefort was not an emigrant. He is re|proached with having remitted money to Bouille&mdash;the letter of Bouille &s;ays;
<Q>Given to Mon&s;ieur, the king's brother, by his order.</Q>
The truth is, that he never remitted pecu|niary a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mon&s;ieur, and the order there &s;poken of was that of Mon&s;ieur, not that of the king. All that he did was to be &s;ecurity for his other brother in a &s;um of 400,000 livres, but it was in 1789, and he was induced to this &s;tep by the motive of humanity.</P>
<P>He is reproached with the manoeuvres of Dumou&s;tier at the court of Berlin; but Dumo&s;tier was not his agent, he was the agent of the princes, his brothers.</P>
<P>A letter from Choi&s;eul Gouffier is al&s;o oppo&s;ed to him. It was thought that becau&s;e he was the amba&s;&s;ador of Louis, they might impute to him the plans of Choi&s;eul Gouffier, but the letter it&s;elf of this amba&s;&s;ador proves that it was but three days after his recall, and on account of his recall, that he had formed an intrigue again&s;t the national amba&s;&s;ador who replaced him. It was Choi&s;eul who wrote, who acted, who &s;poke of his &s;ervices to the princes, the king's brothers, and the note proves that the king had no relation with him.</P>
<P>I come now to the reproaches of &s;ubordination of &s;everal members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly. This plan reduced the liquidation of the offices ten millions, it di&s;charged the natio|nal bank, and charged the civil li&s;t with the intere&s;t of this &s;um. A corruption which turns to the profit of per&s;onal in|tere&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="025499_0017_0FCDEC1F4CE3E958">
may be conceived: but a caption that leaves us all the &s;hame, and &s;ecures to others all the profit is &s;carcely to be imagined&mdash;the fact is, and it re&s;ults from the papers com|municated to the king, that it was he alone who prevented the plan of a decree from being laid before the a&s;&s;embly, and that he expre&s;&s;ed his anger and indignation at it.</P>
<P>A reproach has been made again&s;t him which has excited the indignation of the people, and which mu&s;t in fact appear a heavy charge; he has been accu&s;ed of having paid his gar|des du-corps at Coblentz. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this accu|&s;ation made an afflicting impre&s;&s;ion upon me, I even &s;u&s;pected his good faith, the papers appeared to me deci&s;ive. I now come to make a due reparation in the eyes of Europe. All the papers relate to the month of October, 1791; hear what the admini&s;trator of the civil li&s;t writes to the trea&s;urer in the month of November&mdash;"The intention of his maje&s;ty is to continue the pay of his gardes-du corps till they are replac|ed, but his maje&s;ty means that the amount of this &s;hall not be delivered in a total to the etat major, but to every indi|vidual at the bank of the civil li&s;t upon his own receipt, and his certificate of re&s;idence within the kingdom."</P>
<P>All the papers have been made as public as po&s;&s;ible, he has been denounced to France, to all Europe; all the&s;e heads of accu&s;ation have been printed, and the paper, which alone an&s;wers all the&s;e accu&s;ations, has been the only one unknown&mdash;this ought to be with the other papers. By what &s;trange fatality is it not found there? he has at length obtained, after much trouble an authentic copy of this letter from the office: he produces it to the eyes of Europe.</P>
<P>I come, la&s;tly, to that di&s;a&s;trous day, the 10th of Augu&s;t. If we had believed that he had committed the crimes imputed to him, you would not &s;ee us at this bar lending him the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of our courageous veracity. All your &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;ince that day &s;hould permit you to be generous&mdash;I demand only that you be ju&s;t; he feared that his palace would be invaded, he kept up the mo&s;t exact corre&s;pondence with the popular au|authorities, in &s;hort the people are there, the procureur &s;yn|dic reads, with regret doubtle&s;s, the Vth article of the law which orders to repel force by force, the gunners, as their only an&s;wer, di&s;charge their cannon before him.</P>
<P>Then the procureur &s;yndic invites him to come to the
<PB N="20" REF="025499_0018_0FCDEC205F8CC458">
a&s;&s;embly&mdash;he comes&mdash;an hour afterwards our misfortunes commence; how did the battle begin? I know not, hi&s;tory perhaps will be equally ignorant of it</P>
<P>He is reproached with having pa&s;&s;ed his troops in review &mdash;well then reproach the mayor for having vi&s;ited the po&s;t&mdash;was he not a con&s;tituted authority? was not his authority a depo&s;it in his hands, to which the law forbid him to &s;uffer the lea&s;t attack? I know it has been &s;aid, that he had excited the in&s;urrection, to gain the end of his plan, but who is now ignorant that this in&s;urrection had been planned, ripened; that it had its agents, its council, its directory? who knows not that there had been &s;igned acts and treaties on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Within this hall has been conte&s;ted the glories of the 10th of Augu&s;t. I do not come to di&s;pute the glory; but &s;ince it has been proved that this day was meditated, how can it be attributed as a crime to him? and you accu&s;e him, and will pronounce &s;entence again&s;t him! again&s;t him who never yet gave a &s;anguinary order; again&s;t him who at Varennes, rather cho&s;e to return a captive, than expo&s;e the life of a &s;ingle man! again&s;t him, who, on the 20th of June, refu&s;ed every kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and preferred to remain alone, &s;ur|rounded by the people.</P>
<P>Hear hi&s;tory &s;ay, that Louis, exalted 20 years upon the throne, gave an example of morals, ju&s;tice, and oeconomy, He aboli&s;hed &s;ervitude in his dominions; the people wi&s;hed for liberty&mdash;he gave it them.&mdash;The glory cannot be di&s;puted to him, that he has ever anticipated the de&s;ires of the people &mdash;I &s;top&mdash;hi&s;tory &s;hall fini&s;h&mdash;Think that hi&s;tory &s;hall pa&s;s a &s;entence on your judgment.</P>
<P>When Mr. De&s;eze had &s;at down, the unfortunate Louis aro&s;e with much emotion, and addre&s;&s;ed the Convention in the&s;e words:&mdash;"Citizens, you have heard the manner and matter of my defence. I pledge my&s;elf that the &s;tatement of my coun&s;el is true in every re&s;pect. Perhaps this is the la&s;t time I &s;hall addre&s;s you; but be that as it may, and de|cide as you think proper, my con&s;cience does not reproach me. I feel inexpre&s;&s;ibly hurt by one of your charges, viz. that I wi&s;hed to &s;hed the blood of the people; and to have it &s;aid that I excited the horrible in&s;urrection of the 10th
<PB N="21" REF="025499_0019_0FCDEC24104DA138">
of Augu&s;t. My &s;oul is weighed down to the earth with the calumny, that I ever had any intention to cau&s;e the blood of the citizens to be &s;pilt."</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident then pre&s;ented him a note, and begged to be informed whether he knew the hand-writing.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;ident.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect the&s;e five keys?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I do. I remember &s;ome placed at the Feuillans, but I cannot &s;ay that the&s;e are the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<P>The pre&s;ident a&s;ked him if he had any thing more to &s;ay in his defence.</P>
<P>He having an&s;wered in the negative, was permitted to re|tire, which he did, attended by his coun&s;el.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Manuel reque&s;ted that the defence of Louis, as well as his accu&s;ation, &s;hould lay on the table, that every part of his defence &s;hould be printed and di&s;tribu|ted among the members of the Convention, and &s;ent to all the departments. It was al&s;o decreed, that the defence &s;hould be &s;igned by the king him&s;elf and coun&s;el.</P>
<P>The remaining part of this day, and the two following, the Convention was occupied in hearing the opinions of the &s;everal members. Some were for pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence of death immediately: others were for referring the &s;entence to the primary a&s;&s;emblies: others, again, were for bani&s;hing him for ever, and making it death for him to return.</P>
<P>On the 5th of January, 1793, the Convention received a letter from the king's coun&s;el, containing &s;ome ob&s;ervations on a charge made againg the king by one of the members of the Convention, of having con&s;tantly kept two mini&s;ters, one o&s;ten&s;ible, the other private; and for having, in con&s;equence of this &s;ecret mini&s;try, &s;ent Hayman to Pru&s;&s;ia. They a&s;|&s;erted, that the king, at the time he projected his journey to Montmedi, had tran&s;mitted to Bouille the &s;um of 993,000 livres, of which he was to give an account after his return to Paris. Bouille having retired to Luxembourg, the king's brother, who went thither al&s;o, finding him&s;elf without re|&s;ources, took from Bouille the &s;um of 670,000 livres. It was from this &s;um that the princes took 3,400 livres for the ex|pence of Hayman's journey to Pru&s;&s;ia, on the king's &s;ervice. This exception was in con&s;equence of a very extraordinary affectation in the princes, when they formed &s;entiments or
<PB N="22" REF="025499_0020_0FCDEC2591223B00">
entered into negociations with foreign powers. Louis could not prevent his brothers from abu&s;ing his name; and in a denunciation made to the national a&s;&s;embly on the 31&s;t of March, in the king's name, by the mini&s;ter Dumourier, of a treaty between the princes and Hohenloe, Dumourier was particularly charged to te&s;tify to the a&s;&s;embly how much the king was afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed an account of this &s;tep. On the 5th of July he denounced a loan of eight millions, nego|ciated for the princes, in Holland, by one Harel-la-Verter. They concluded by this remark; that had there exi&s;ted a &s;ecret mini&s;try, &s;ome proofs would have been among the pa|pers found at the Thuilleries, when the palace was attacked, as the king was in the habit of pre&s;erving all his papers.</P>
<P>On the 14th, the Convention adopted the three follow|ing que&s;tions, propo&s;ed by the pre&s;ident:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Is Louis guilty or not guilty of high trea&s;on; and of at|tempts again&s;t the general &s;afety of the &s;tate?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Shall the appeal to the people take place?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>What puni&s;hment &s;hall he &s;uffer?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The next day it was decreed, that the &s;en&s;e of the Con|vention &s;hould be taken on each que&s;tion, by a nominal call: and one of the &s;ecretaries having read the fir&s;t que&s;tion, and having fini&s;hed the call, the pre&s;ident declared, that of 735 voters, 693 had voted in the affirmative, and therefore pro|nounced <HI>Louis Capet guilty of high trea&s;on and attempts again&s;t the general &s;afety of the &s;tate.</HI></P>

<P>On the 16th the Convention took up the third propo&s;i|tion; when, after a very long debate, the pre&s;ident ro&s;e and announced, that of 720 votes, 366 were for death.

<P>On the 19th the Convention pa&s;&s;ed the following decree unanimou&s;ly:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The executive council &s;hall be &s;ummoned to meet at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, and a copy of the decree which pronounces &s;entence again&s;t Louis &s;hall be delivered them.</P>

<P>On the 20th the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice informed the Conven|tion, that the executive council had been &s;ummoned, and had a&s;&s;embled early in the morning, in order to execute the decree relative to Louis Capet. The council had called the mayor, the department, the commandant-general, and public accu&s;er to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Having concerted with the&s;e the mea&s;ures of execution, the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, pre&s;ident of the executive council, a member of council, the &s;ecretary, and two members of the department, went together to the temple about 2 o'clock, and being introduced to Louis, the pre&s;ident of the executive council told him, that they were charged to notify to him the extract from the minutes of the Convention, dated the 15th, 17th and 19th of January, which the &s;ecretary then read.</P>
<P>Louis pre&s;ented them with a written paper, &s;igned with his own hand. They an&s;wered that they would deliberate thereon; and having retired, re&s;olved that it &s;hould be &s;ub|mitted to the Convention.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After this paper was read, the Convention decreed that there was no room to deliberate thereon, having anticipated the greater part of the reque&s;ts, in the decree of the day before.</P>
<P>On the 20th, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the unfortunate Louis took leave of his family.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>On the 21&s;t, conformably to the arrangements made by the executive council, Louis was put to death at the Place de la Revolution, heretofore Place de Louis XV.</P>
<P>Twenty-five citizens of known principles, well armed, acquainted with the manual exerci&s;e, and having each 16 rounds of &s;hot, were cho&s;en from each &s;ection to form a guard of 1200 men, who accompanied the unfortunate monarch to the place of execution.</P>
<P>Strong detachments from the different legions were po&s;ted in the &s;treets through which the royal pri&s;oner was to pa&s;s, and al&s;o in all the avenues leading to the Place de la Revolu|tion, to prevent any confu&s;ion, and each &s;ection had a body in re&s;erve, ready to move at moment's warning, to main|tain public order, &s;hould any attempt be made to di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>Cannon were al&s;o di&s;tributed in every quarter, where it was thought they could be any way &s;erviceable, had events made it nece&s;&s;ary to have employed them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="025499_0023_0FCDEC2B90C07B90">Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Louis proceeded from his apartments in the Temple, and got into the Mayor's carriage, who accompanied him, as did al&s;o M. Edgworth, or de Formont, an Iri&s;h prie&s;t, whom he reque&s;t|ed might attend him. Louis was dre&s;&s;ed in a brown great coat, white wai&s;tcoat, black breeches and &s;tockings; his hair was dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion commanded by M. Santerre, proceeded along the Boulevard, to the Place de la Revolution. One hundred Gendarmes on hor&s;eback formed an advanced guard to the proce&s;&s;ion. The rear guard was compo&s;ed of one hundred national guards from the military &s;chool. Vari|ous re&s;erves of cavalry lined the proce&s;&s;ion, and patroled the the out-&s;kirts of the city.</P>
<P>The unfortunate monarch arrived at the foot of the &s;caf|fold at twenty minutes pa&s;t ten. He mounted the &s;caffold with firmne&s;s and dignity&mdash;and appeared de&s;irous to addre&s;s the people. Drums and trumpets gave the &s;ignal, and at twenty-two minutes pa&s;t ten his head was &s;evered from his body. The Place de la Revolution was &s;o &s;trongly guarded by troops, that no per&s;on was &s;uffered to pa&s;s after the king had entered it, tho&s;e however who had previou&s;ly entered and got near enough to the &s;caffold, notwith&s;tanding the noi&s;e of drums and trumpets, heard him plainly pronounce the&s;e words&mdash;"Citizens, I forgive my enemies, and I die innocent!"</P>
<P>Louis, on mounting the &s;caffold, in&s;tantly took off his great coat and unfa&s;tened his &s;hirt collar. His hair had been clubbed up clo&s;e like an abbe, that no indignity might be offered him, or that it &s;hould occa&s;ion delay by hanging loo&s;e. The executioner went up to tie his arms, which the king recoiled at; but it was &s;oon done&mdash;The executioner then took a large pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars to cut off his hair, at which the king appeared very much mortified, and &s;aid, "I have put all right." His hair, however, was cut off.</P>
<P>When the executioner &s;hewed his head to the people, cries of "Vive la nation! Vive la Republic!" were heard on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>His body was tran&s;ported to the pari&s;h-church of La Mag|delane, where it was interred without any in&s;ult being offered
<PB N="26" REF="025499_0024_0FCDEC2EF6FC81F0">
to it, between the per&s;ons who lo&s;t their lives during the illu|minations on account of his marriage, and the Swi&s;s who fell on the 10th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Louis, before his departure from the Temple, delivered to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Council General, who were upon the guard, his latter will, two copies of which he had writ|ten on the 25th of December la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed in the 40th year of his age, Louis XVI. once the generous friend and ally of the United States, but who, by the infernal machinations of a wicked mini&s;try, in|curred the hatred of his nation.&mdash;A dreadful example to tho&s;e princes who trample on the &s;acred "Rights of Man."</P>

<HEAD>Copy of the la&s;t will of Louis XVI.</HEAD>
<P>In the name of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, Amen.</P>
<P>I, <HI>Louis the XVI.</HI> king of France, having been for better than four months detained with my family in the tower of the temple of Paris, by tho&s;e who were my &s;ubjects, and depriv|ed of all communication, even with my family &s;ince the 11th in&s;tant, be&s;ides being involved in a proce&s;s of which it is im|po&s;&s;ible to know the event, in con&s;equence of the pa&s;&s;ions of men who can alledge no good pretext for their conduct, and who have no motive that can be &s;upported by any exi&s;ting law&mdash;thus circum&s;tanced, without any per&s;on pre&s;ent but God to witne&s;s my &s;orrows, to whom I may have recour&s;e, I DO DECLARE here in his pre&s;ence, this to be my la&s;t will and determination.</P>
<P>I recommend my &s;oul to God my Creator, whom I be|&s;eech to receive it in mercy and not to judge it as it de&s;erves, but through the merits of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who offer|ed him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to God his Father, for all men, however unworthy they may be, and I the unworthie&s;t of them all.</P>
<P>I die in union with our Holy Mother, the Catholic Apo|&s;tolic and Roman church, which holds its powers by unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from St. Peter to whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t had confided it.</P>
<P>I firmly believe and confe&s;s all that is contained in the creed, the commandments of God, and of the church, the &s;acraments and mi&s;teries, &s;uch as they are and always were taught by the Catholic church.</P>
<P>I never pretended to judge of the different modes of ex|plaining the tenets which divide the church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but have conformed my&s;elf to them, and always will do &s;o whil&s;t God &s;hall &s;pare my life; to the deci&s;ions which eccle|&s;ia&s;tic &s;uperiors give and may give according to the princi|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I pity, with all my heart, tho&s;e of my brethren who may live in error, I do not pretend to judge them, but I love them all in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to the precepts of Chri|&s;tian charity.</P>
<P>I devoutly pray to God to forgive my &s;ins having previ|ou&s;ly &s;crupulou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed and repented of them, not having been able to avail my&s;elf of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Catholic prie&s;t,
<PB N="28" REF="025499_0026_0FCDEC32528DBD98">
I pray to God that he may receive this confe&s;&s;ion which I have made, and e&s;pecially my profound repentance which I feel for having &s;igned, although contrary to my inclination, any acts which may have di&s;agreed with the faith or di&s;cipline of the holy Catholic church to which I have ever adhered with all my heart.</P>
<P>I pray to God to receive my firm re&s;olution, if he pre|&s;erves my life, to avail my&s;elf of the fir&s;t opportunity of the mini&s;try of a Catholic prie&s;t, in order to accu&s;e my&s;elf of all my &s;ins, and to receive the &s;acrament of penance.</P>
<P>I beg pardon of all tho&s;e whom I may inadvertently have injured, for I do not remember to have deliberately offended any one, and al&s;o I beg pardon of all to whom I may have &s;et any bad example, and I hope they will forgive me, if they think they have been injured thereby.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech all charitable per&s;ons, that they unite their pray|ers with mine, in order to obtain a pardon from God for my &s;ins. I forgive with all heart, all tho&s;e who have acted as my ene|mies without my having given cau&s;e, and I pray to God to pardon them as well as tho&s;e who by a fal&s;e or mi&s;guided zeal have done me great injury.</P>
<P>I recommend to God my wife and children, my &s;i&s;ter, my aunts, my brothers, and all tho&s;e allied to me by blood, or in any other manner, every other po&s;&s;ible connection. I parti|cularly pray to God to look down in mercy on my wife my children and &s;i&s;ter, who have &s;uffered with me &s;o long, and that he will &s;upport them with his grace, in ca&s;e they &s;hould lo&s;e me, and that I &s;hould be taken from this tran&s;itory world.</P>
<P>I recommend my children to my wife, of who&s;e mater|nal tenderne&s;s I never have doubted, and I recommend to her to educate them in the principles of chri&s;tianity and mo|ral hone&s;ty, and that &s;he may teach them to look upon the &s;plendor of this world in ca&s;e they &s;hould be condemned to it as upon dangerous and tran&s;ient good, and I hope &s;he may lay before their view only the principles of &s;olid and ever|la&s;ting glory.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech my &s;i&s;ter to pre&s;erve her attachment to my children, which &s;he has always &s;hewn, and that &s;he will act the part of a mother in ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to lo&s;e their own.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech my wife to pardon all that &s;he has &s;uffered in

con&s;equence of her attachment to me; as well as for any di&s;|gu&s;t I may have occa&s;ioned her &s;ince our union: likewi&s;e, I declare that I do not reproach her with any thing, though &s;he her&s;elf might think that &s;he has &s;omething to repent of.</P>
<P>I al&s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;t from my children, that after per|forming their duties to God, which ought always to be their fir&s;t con&s;ideration, they will ever be united and obedient to their mother and grateful for all the carefulne&s;s and &s;or|rows &s;he way &s;uffer for their &s;ake, and remembrance of me. I reque&s;t that they may look on my &s;i&s;ter as their mother.</P>
<P>I recommend to my &s;on, if ever he &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to be a king, that he mu&s;t think it his duty to devote him&s;elf entirely to promote the happine&s;s of his fellow citizens, and to bury in oblivion all rancour and re&s;entment, and e&s;pecially every thing which re&s;pects the injuries and abu&s;es inflicted on me. He cannot make the people happy, without conforming to the laws of the country; but at the &s;ame time to con&s;i|der, that a king cannot make him&s;elf re&s;pected, nor do the good he would wi&s;h, unle&s;s he be inverted with &s;ufficient au|thority, otherwi&s;e he will be ob&s;tructed in his operations, and not in&s;piring any re&s;pect, he will be more prejudicial than u&s;eful to his country.</P>
<P>I recommend to my &s;on to take care of all tho&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;hewn affection for me, whenever his circum&s;tances will permit, and he &s;hould con&s;ider it as a &s;acred debt, which I have contracted with the children and relations of tho&s;e who died on account of their attachments to me, and con&s;e|quently with tho&s;e who are unhappy for my &s;ake. I know that &s;everal per&s;ons who were attached to me, have not done by me as they ought to have done, and who have even &s;hewn them&s;elves ungrateful. I forgive them however: as, in times of trouble and efferve&s;ence, per&s;ons are not always ma&s;ters of them&s;elves, and I reque&s;t of my &s;on, in ca&s;e op|portunity &s;erves, that he will remember that they are un|happy.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h to te&s;tify at this moment my &s;incere gratitude to all tho&s;e who have &s;hewn me a true and di&s;intere&s;ted at|tachment towards me: if on the one &s;ide I felt very &s;en&s;ibly the ingratitude and di&s;loyalty of tho&s;e men to whom I had never done any thing but loading them with benefits, as well as their friends; on the other &s;ide I have had the con&s;olation

I recommend them, however, e&s;pecially to my &s;on, that he may acknowledge them if ever it is in his power.</P>

<P>I al&s;o freely forgive all tho&s;e who guarded me, for the ill treatments and hard&s;hips which they have thought proper to put upon me.</P>
