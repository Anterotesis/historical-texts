<HEAD>HEBREWS xiii. Chap. 4 ver. <HI>Marriage is honorable in all.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE great bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, is to gain the ma&s;|tery of corrupt de&s;ires, and bring our hearts to the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of pure and holy ones: and this is the mo&s;t honorable attainment any can expect to arrive to. Honor and happine&s;s mankind univer&s;ally thir&s;t for; but the true idea of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> honor and happine&s;s are, is not al|ways conceived of; nor is the right way to obtain it, univer&s;ally adopted True honor and happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in loving GOD and univer&s;al being, as them&s;elves.&mdash; Man's temper is naturally moro&s;e; and hatred is the &s;pontaneous product; there are pa&s;&s;ionate feelings in men, which produce a kind of exerci&s;e called love; but it is a very different kind from what is required; it is often productive of di&s;grace rather than honor, and pain rather than happine&s;s. GOD has in mercy wi&s;ely ap|pointed means to &s;often and change men's tempers, and fit their hearts for tender and good affections; in order to le&s;&s;en the burdens of life and &s;weeten its bitter ingre|dients, the in&s;titution of MARRIAGE. which GOD has appointed, often has its beneficial effects upon the feel|ings and hearts of men; as well as in civil &s;ociety in gen|eral&mdash;and it is pronounced honorable for all per&s;ons to attend to it&mdash;<HI>"It is not good for man to be alone&mdash;two are better than one, becau&s;e they have a good reward for their labour. And if one prevail again&s;t him, two &s;hall with&s;tand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."</HI></P>
<P>AND in all ages of the world, down to the pre&s;ent day, the greater part, yea almo&s;t all regular, well di&s;po&s;ed people, have made u&s;e of the in&s;titution of Marriage; and the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on of GOD'S appointing it, was to pre&s;erve purity of life and manners, render each &s;ex a comfort, ble&s;&s;ing and joy to one another, by their mutu|al aid and friend&s;hip&mdash;continue a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lives up|on the earth, and increa&s;e in numbers till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P><PB REF="049043_0004_10264C0B9542C3A8">MARRIAGE is honorable (undoubtedly) in its in&s;titu|tion among all people: but to have people become an honor to it, and honored by it, depends upon their views in it, and right improvement of it. And now, that we may have a right under&s;tanding and proper views of the in&s;titution of Marriage, and improve the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion aright, the fir&s;t object will be to &s;hew what marriage is, &s;econd, point out why marriage is honorable, and what views people ought to have in it; thirdly, attend to a few inferences and addre&s;&s;es from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we are to &s;hew what Marriage is&mdash;MARRIAGE is a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contract, in which the parties give them&s;elves to each other; manife&s;ting their regard, affection and love. Marriage has been called by many a Civil Con|tract, in which a man and woman unite together for life. But I am rather inclined to think it ought to be called a Religious Contract from the comment CHRIST gave upon MOSES'S giving bills of divorce. &mdash; But, whatever people ca&s;t it, civil or religious, it is an important and in|tere&s;ting connection: and for this cau&s;e, GOD made them male and female and they leave father and mo|ther, and covenant together, and of twain become one. Covenants are of little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the parties, unle&s;s they feel what they profe&s;s, and prac|ti&s;e what they covenant. What makes covenants valid or beneficial to the parties, is having a real affection of heart one for the other, and the &s;ame views in each mind to act up to the &s;pirit of the contract, and being united or one in their minds. The ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer prayed that his di&s;ciples and followers might be one with him, as he was one with the Father. There was a covenant between the Father and Son, in the work of Redemp|tion: And Chri&s;t prayed for a onene&s;s in his followers with him, knowing that if the &s;ame mind was in them which he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, his yoke would be ea&s;y upon them, and his burden light, i. e. they would go on to fulfil all duty towards one another, with cheerfulne&s;s and love; hence per&s;ons, really married in a proper &s;en&s;e, not only

in their hearts one for the other; and this makes Marriage delightful, and the connection &s;weet, and lays a good foundation for comfort, while life &s;hall la&s;t. But to know the heart and feel what we profe&s;s, is an import|ant matter in all we tran&s;act, and &s;tamps dignity upon what is done. But this leads me to the 2d head, viz. to &s;hew why Marriage is honorable, and what views people ought to have in it&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. MARRIAGE is honorable, in that it is beneficial and for the happine&s;s of individuals; but more e&s;pecial|ly for the general good and u&s;e of the world; and as it is lawful in it&s;elf, both by civil and divine &s;tatutes, it mu&s;t be reputable and highly commendable for people to cel|ebrate the ordinance. Having a benevolent, &s;trong in|clination to do good; and a re&s;olute, active mind to pur|&s;ue it; and going on to do what&s;oever our hands find to do, in our day and generation, by the will of GOD, is the great thing which really does, or ever ought to rai&s;e men's reputation, and make them honorable in the earth.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. MARRIAGE is honorable, becau&s;e GOD hath appointed it. Any thing which is appointed as the ef|fect of perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, mu&s;t be an honor|able appointment; and from what CHRIST relates in the 19th of Matthew, from the 4th to the 10th ver&s;e, and the 10th of Mark, from the 6th to the 10th ver&s;e&mdash;the words in both books are nearly the &s;ame&mdash;containing an an&s;wer to the cavilling Scribes&mdash;I will repeat the words in Mark; <HI>From the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. For this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and they twain &s;hall be one fle&s;h; &s;o then they are no more twain but one fle&s;h&mdash; What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put a&s;under.</HI> And the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle in our text, &s;ays plainly, Marriage is honorable in all; and the bed unde|filed: but whoremongers and adulterers GOD will judge. I think it is plain GOD in&s;tituted Marriage from the cre|ation, and ever meant it &s;hould be practi&s;ed; and it is honorable for all per&s;ons to practi&s;e it; but irregular
<PB REF="049043_0007_10264C12B0664628">
connections, or unlawful, di&s;orderly unions between the &s;exes, GOD will judge, and puni&s;h all who do not keep up to the &s;trict rules of decency and order. Order and decency are ever to be regarded in what people tran&s;|act; pa&s;&s;ionate feelings and irregular de&s;ires, are not to have the reigns of government; GOD is a GOD of or|der; and for people to do right in marrying, they &s;hould enter into the Marriage covenant, with humble, thank|ful, believing hearts, rejoicing in the Divine Goodne&s;s, intending to &s;erve GOD better, and be more exten&s;ively u&s;eful in their day and generation&mdash;And hence, when|ever the probable appearance of u&s;efulne&s;s and duty is greater by union, than to live &s;ingle, people ought to marry, and not otherwi&s;e. This was Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s way of rea|&s;oning upon the &s;ubject. <HI>Have I not a right to lead about a wife, or &s;i&s;ter, as other Apo&s;tles?</HI> It was lawful, but not expedient&mdash;for the then di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the Church, it was not be&s;t to marry&mdash;But marriage always was hon|orable in its in&s;titution; and for the good of &s;ociety in general; but at &s;ome times it may not be expedient.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. WE now proceed to &s;hew more particularly what views people ought to have in marrying. "What&s;oev|er we do, eat or drink, or what&s;oever, we are command|ed to do all to the glory of GOD." Then it will follow, whether we marry or not, we mu&s;t do all to the glory of GOD; live, not to our&s;elves, but to him who died for us and ro&s;e again. It is evident all thoughts, words and actions have a near connection with future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery&mdash;according to the words of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>For every idle word &s;hall man give account thereof in the day of judgment.</HI> To be able to an&s;wer for our conduct hereafter, and act honorably in what we do, the thing we perform mu&s;t be lawful, or right in its nature, and our intentions good in doing of it&mdash;To have right intentions in what we perform, the greate&s;t good mu&s;t be aimed at. To plea&s;e our own fancies, or gratify a &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ign is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of an accountable crea|ture; to u&s;e the ordinance of marriage right, therefore,
<PB REF="049043_0008_10264C156AABC078">
it is as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that our de&s;ign be to glori|fy GOD, and not act with a view to plea&s;e our&s;elves, as in u&s;ing any other ordinance. Whoever then would enter into the covenant of Marriage, and hope for a di|vine ble&s;&s;ing in it, receive honor by it, and be an honor to it, mu&s;t weigh well his circum&s;tances, whether it be lawful and expedient; if found to be, then are my views right in doing it; can I change my &s;tate with a real de|&s;ign and intention to &s;erve and honor my Creator; and be more exten&s;ively u&s;eful in the world? If I can do thus, under&s;tandingly, then Marriage, is honorable to a per&s;on, and the Divine de&s;ign is complied with in it.</P>
<P>MOSES, we read, for the hardne&s;s of men's hearts gave bills of divorce; but from the beginning it was not &s;o. Per&s;ons ought to act under&s;tandingly, and then live to|gether in love; being married in the Lord, and never think of parting till death di&s;&s;olves the connection, and &s;o &s;anctify the ordinance, and it will be an honor to be married. But to do as &s;ome have done, form a pa&s;&s;ion|ate, incon&s;iderate connection; and afterwards live in contention; &s;uch di&s;honor them&s;elves and the ordinance, and they had better not marry, than be guilty of &s;uch an abu&s;e. Many ordinances, which are good in them&s;elves and appointed for the happine&s;s and benefit of people, are greatly di&s;honored and abu&s;ed, by the ra&s;h, unruly de&s;ires of tho&s;e, who ru&s;h into them without a right pre|paration of heart.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WE learn from our &s;ubject, that it is the duty of people, to have &s;pecial and particular reference to the Divine Honor, in all their pur&s;uits and actions of life; there is not any object which accountable creatures may pur&s;ue and plea&s;e GOD, unle&s;s the ultimate end of the pur&s;uit be the divine glory. This is evidently the ca&s;e, in the u&s;e of all ordinances civil and religious. The im|provement of time, all favors, privileges, and mercies, mu&s;t be received with gratitude; giving glory to GOD; and realizing our con&s;tant dependance for every ble&s;|&s;ing,
<PB N="9" REF="049043_0009_10263A386F5BB010">
and hence all incon&s;iderate, ra&s;h, unmeaning con|duct is highly reprovable in all per&s;ons. We ought to look well to the end of things in the beginning; &s;ee if po&s;&s;ible what will be the following con&s;equences. But in an e&s;pecial manner, &s;ee to it that our motives are good, and our minds not blinded by &s;elfi&s;h, corrupt de&s;ires.&mdash; This is the way to have the eye &s;ingle, and the body full of light&mdash;And the way to be ble&s;&s;ings in the world, and do good in our day and generation; perform that which is well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD, and lay up a good trea&s;ure again&s;t the time to come.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. IS the divine glory and happine&s;s of man, the great object of pur&s;uit, as has been &s;hown, at which we all ought to aim? Let this &s;ubject call up our atten|tion to a thorough examination of our&s;elves; and upon a &s;trict review of our intentions and conduct; we may ea&s;ily learn, whether we are &s;erving the great Creator, who is GOD over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever; or the creature, which is idolatry. And this is an important matter, for us to know; for upon the acqui&s;ition of this knowledge, happine&s;s or mi&s;ery will &s;urely be the re&s;ult. They who know they love GOD, go on with a cheerful heart to give glory to his name, and feel intere&s;ted in the good of mankind; have a firm foundation laid, for comfort and increa&s;ing felicity; becau&s;e there are no changes in the object of their hopes, the overflowing fountain of all goodne&s;s ever &s;upplys them: and their hearts are e&s;tab|li&s;hed, tru&s;ting in the Lord; being warmed, &s;trengthen|ed and comforted in their minds; are happy in the good &s;ervice of the Mo&s;t High. While creature di&s;ciples, or &s;elfi&s;h idolaters, are pur&s;uing after that which they never will find, and in cha&s;e of &s;omething which does not exi&s;t, in the way they hope to overtake it. Mi&s;ery then mu&s;t be the portion of all who tru&s;t in earthly enjoyments. For earthly things were not made to &s;atisfy immortal &s;ouls, or fill the place of &s;piritual enjoyments. But be|fore I di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, permit me an addre&s;s upon the

pre&s;ent agreeable, important occa&s;ion: the Celebration of Marriage.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, ob&s;erve the &s;cenes we are now acting are &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;ing away. Marriage is a temporal ble&s;&s;ing; but &s;oon we &s;hall be beyond &s;uch &s;cenes as this. The greate&s;t of in&s;tructors has told us, that in the future &s;tate there is neither marriage, nor giving in marriage; but regenerated &s;ouls, &s;hall be as Angels of God in heaven, i. e. nothing of this temporary bodily marriage we now u&s;e; but an holy union of &s;oul with Chri&s;t; and all holy beings, and all &s;uch as love and &s;erve GOD here, &s;hall &s;it down at the Marriage Supper there. And now may it not be highly proper, to query with our&s;elves&punc; who have been and are about to pa&s;s the &s;cene of temporary Marriage&mdash;are we &s;piritually married to Chri&s;t? and do we all love, and endeavor to live upon, and act up to, the Covenant of Grace, as required of us in the Bible? or do we live in the world together like heirs of the grace of life? It is truly important, to fulfil the Law of Love, and &s;eek to promote each others happine&s;s; and e&s;peci|ally to encourage one another in the duties of Chri&s;tian|ity. To have the privilege of living together, in the world, in the mutual exerci&s;e of love and friend&s;hip; bearing one another's burden, a&s;&s;i&s;ting and comforting in all the cares and trials of life; is not a &s;mall favour. But to dwell together in the other world, as Angels of Light, is an infinitely grater favour; and if we love not our wives, hu&s;bands, and brethren, and dwell not toge|ther with them in love, whom we have &s;een; how can we expect we love GOD, whom we have not &s;een? or that we &s;hall dwell together in the eternal world, and be happy? O then let us all try to do right; and wherev|er there are any wrong feelings of heart, &s;uppre&s;s them; or a want of love, let it &s;pring up and grow; as expre&s;&s;|ed, Colo&s;&s;ans 3.18. <HI>Hu&s;bands love your wives, and be not bitter again&s;t them; and ye wives, &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto your own hu&s;bands, as is fit in the Lord.</HI></P>
