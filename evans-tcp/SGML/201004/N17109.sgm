<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Sometime ago an aged pious matron of this city, re|lated as follows, re&s;pecting a pious girl that lived with her and loved that which is good. But had heard an evil report of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, that he was a fal&s;e teacher and impo&s;ed on the people, and knew nothing about the go&s;pel, and never preached a good &s;ermon in his life.&mdash; So it fell out one day, that &s;he was reque&s;ting her mi&s;tre&s;s to read &s;ome good book to her, but objected &s;trongly again&s;t Mr. Whitefield's writings, and did not like them at all. However her mi&s;tre&s;s con&s;ented to read to her a &s;ermon, and the girl approved of it exceedingly; and &s;aid that &s;he never heard a better &s;ermon in her life.&mdash;Then her mi&s;tre&s;s informed her who the author was viz. Mr. Whitefield. The hone&s;t girl began to weep and wring her hands and &s;aid, "that &s;he was the vile&s;t and mo&s;t wicked wretch on earth to de&s;pi&s;e and reject &s;uch a worthy and faithful &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the influence of a fal&s;e report, without any foun|dation."</P>
<P>The above gentlewoman informed me, that &s;he had heard an ill report of Baron Sweedenbourg's works, but not wil|ling to depend upon mere hear&s;ay, was determined to &s;end for the Baron's book: And having read a part of it, and found it be a jargon of enthu&s;ia&s;m; now &s;ays the lady, "I judge for my&s;elf, and am &s;atisfied; the report which I heard is true.&mdash;Therefore I advi&s;e all carnal and ungodly people, who de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule the Rev. George Whitefield, or his writings, to prove his works by the &s;acred &s;criptures, read and judge for them&s;elves&mdash;I al&s;o reque&s;t them &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was de&s;pi&s;ed and ridiculed al&s;o, by the hypocritical Scribes and Phari&s;ees of his day, and the mo&s;t notorious lies laid to his charge viz. They &s;aid that "Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a glutton and a drunkard a deceiver of the people, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the de|vil," &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o informed that a certain gentleman now living in this city: Who is one of the fir&s;t rate writers, and a very excellent poet; this gentleman informed a friend of mine, that he peru&s;es the Baron's works out of curio&s;ity to know what he had to &s;ay&mdash;And looks on the Baron's performance in no other light than a whim&s;ical novel &mdash;And I have it from good authority, therefore can avouch it as an authentic truth, that every mini&s;ter in this city, together with hun|dreds of pious chri&s;tians, who in fact di&s;prove the Baron's works, and the rea&s;on is obvious, becau&s;e they are un&s;criptu|ral, and have a great tendency to di&s;honour God and poi&s;on men's &s;ouls.&mdash;</P></NOTE>Now that good friend is gone to re&s;t,</L>
