<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING attained the main object of our wi&s;hes, by a &s;ucce&s;sful termination of the war, we mu&s;t now bend our thoughts to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. We have e&s;tabli&s;hed our independence, and mankind have viewed our exploits with a&s;toni&s;hment; but, to reali&s;e tho&s;e flattering pro&s;pects which pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, when we "took our rank among nations," will require more wi&s;dom and political virtue, than have been manife&s;ted &s;ince the earlie&s;t periods of the conte&s;t&punc; The&s;e United States have di&s;covered an unhappy jealou&s;y of congre&s;s, and of each other; the acts of almo&s;t every legi&s;lature have uniformly tended to di&s;gu&s;t its citizens, and to annihilate its credit; and the natural con&s;equence is a want of confidence between men, a profligacy of morals, and a drooping, di&s;reputable, ruinous commerce. If I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to remedy the&s;e evils, and to obviate impending calamities, I &s;hould pant for a favourable opportunity to abandon a country, which, at pre&s;ent, &s;eems to enjoy the greate&s;t degree of liberty, that is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;o|ciety and government; but which nothing le&s;s than an almo&s;t entire change of mea&s;ures can pre&s;erve from a mi&s;erable tyranny of one kind or another. I rejoice, that I am not &s;ingular in the&s;e ob&s;ervations. A general apprehen&s;ion of danger may lead to &s;ecurity, as every man who perceives it, and con&s;iders the happine&s;s of his country as connected with his own, will think him&s;elf bound to do every thing in his power to &s;ecure it. I &s;hould think my&s;elf deficient in every part of my duty, if I did not, on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, exert my poor abilities to the utmo&s;t. Matters of more general concern, and tho&s;e, which
<PB N="vi" REF="018517_0004_0FA7AE4A514C7F50">particularly re&s;pect other &s;tates, I &s;hall leave to abler pens, and to tho&s;e, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of better means of information. My purpo&s;e is to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t material errors of our own government, and to propo&s;e &s;uch mea&s;ures, as I con|ceive nece&s;&s;ary to revive public credit, to e&s;tabli&s;h a fair na|tional character, and to render government firm, re&s;pectable, and happy. In the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch a de&s;ign, it will be dif|ficult not to offend, unle&s;s it &s;hould plea&s;e Heaven to eradicate from the hearts of men every little &s;elfi&s;h, groveling pa&s;&s;ion, and, in the room thereof, to implant candour, truth, and patrioti&s;m. I mu&s;t however previou&s;ly declare, that my brea&s;t harbours no re&s;entment again&s;t any man, and if in yielding to the &s;trong impul&s;e of an hone&s;t zeal, I &s;hould do no more than confirm, or increa&s;e the number of, my enemies, the reflection will be mor|tifying indeed! but I have that within me, which never failed to admini&s;ter &s;ome con&s;olation in the mo&s;t vexatious occurrences of my life.</P>

<P>AT the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the general a&s;&s;embly, a committee was appointed by the hou&s;e of delegates, to prepare a bill for the relief of public creditors. The intention of the movers for that bill was to e&s;tabli&s;h an equitable rule of di&s;|count between the &s;tate and its debtors. By particular re|que&s;t, the author of the&s;e &s;heets undertook to frame a bill, which went &s;omewhat further than their fir&s;t ideas on the &s;ubject; it was handed about among the members of each hou&s;e, and became a con&s;iderable topic of conver&s;ation out of doors; but neither that bill nor any other was brought in by the committee, and only ineffectual attempts were made to do the bu&s;ine&s;s partially by re&s;olves. The unfortunate bill was either lo&s;t or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. I have recollected the heads, and now offer them to the public with &s;ome improvements, which have &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves &s;ince the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and with &s;uch alterations as have become nece&s;&s;ary by the lap&s;e of time.</P>

<P>I HAVE thus endeavoured to delineate an ea&s;y and &s;im|ple plan, for reducing our affairs to order and regularity, on terms the mo&s;t truly advantageous to the &s;tate; for giving its creditors of every de&s;cription the be&s;t &s;atisfaction in our power, without impo&s;ing new burthens on the people, and, at the &s;ame time, for affording a rea&s;onable relief to a variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed public debtors. As the rea&s;ons, on which it is
<PB N="4" REF="018517_0008_0FA7AE51D50F1918">grounded, may not be obvious to every one, I &s;hall enter in|to a &s;eries of explanatory remarks, and con&s;ider every objec|tion that has been or may be offered to the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>By a con&s;olidation of funds, we avoid much trouble, ex|pence and confu&s;ion. But there is a much more &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on. The funds appropriated to the redemption of red money are at lea&s;t twelve times more than &s;ufficient; for &s;ome certificates there are funds appointed which are by no means adequate, and for the re&s;t there are no funds at all. Let us attend to what was done by a nation, which has not always betrayed a want of political wi&s;dom, in a ca&s;e &s;omewhat &s;imi|lar to this. The produces of the taxes in Great-Britain, not long ago, con&s;tituted each a di&s;tinct fund, for the payment of the &s;ums advanced on each &s;everal tax; it was thought ex|pedient to unice and blend them together, and to &s;uperadd the faith of parliament, for the general &s;ecurity of the whole. Some of the&s;e &s;everal funds were more than &s;ufficient, others were inadequate, and the aggregate fund, formed from their union, might not perhaps have been an ample &s;ecurity for all the &s;ums advanced on the &s;everal taxes. This mea&s;ure, how|ever, excit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d little clamour, and gave no &s;hock to public cre|dit; becau&s;e it was provided, that no injury &s;hould thereby be done to creditors; becau&s;e the public faith had, for a long time, been inviolate; and becau&s;e the people repo&s;ed a con|fidence in government.</P>
<P N="1">1. But the principal objection to the propo&s;ed plan of con|&s;olidation is, that we &s;hall violate our faith, and excite cla|mour and di&s;content, by taking from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of bills of credit the ample &s;ecurity they now have&punc; I have ever been a warm advocate for public faith, and it plea&s;es me to ob&s;erve gentlemen, who have not always paid it a decent regard, at length become &s;en&s;ible of its value; they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that my principles are unchanged, and I congratulate them on the happy alteration in theirs; my grand aim is to re&s;tore public credit, and regain the confidence of the people. I am convinced, he that will give him&s;elf the trouble to examine the &s;tate of our affairs, and con&s;ider, without prejudice, my plan in all its parts, will perceive, that it can have no other tendency. The objection, which appears formidable at fir&s;t &s;ight, will vani&s;h, when we come clo&s;ely to view the &s;ubject. The bills of credit have cea&s;ed to circulate; they are no longer a medium of commerce; they are merely an object of &s;peculation; and the holders of them are actuated by views, very different from that of laying them by until the period of
<PB N="5" REF="018517_0009_0FA7AE5270CA5B40">their redemption; they have obtained them, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;charging debts to the &s;tate, or of &s;elling them to public debtors. If they obtained them for the fir&s;t purpo&s;e, they are not at all affected, if we even take away all the funds, provided we con&s;ent to receive them at par. If for the &s;e|cond, they are not affected, provided we create the demand they had in view, and which would &s;tamp a value on their paper, if no funds had ever been a&s;&s;igned for its redemption. That it has been purcha&s;ed or kept up, for one or the other of the&s;e purpo&s;es, may be inferred from the &s;uperior advan|tages of &s;uch a &s;peculation, which every body at this time of day is acquainted with, and from &s;everal other circum&s;tances. Some time ago, there was a con&s;iderable &s;um of the red bills in the hands of the people; a re&s;olve pa&s;&s;ed the legi&s;lature for receiving them at par; the holders immediately brought them to the trea&s;ury, or &s;old them to the purcha&s;ers of the property pledged for their redemption; and not more than &pound;. 14,000 remain in the hands of the people. There was very little immediate u&s;e for the black, or the continental &s;tate bills; they had, notwith&s;tanding, attained a value not far infe|rior to that of &s;pecie. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that any circum&s;tance re|&s;pecting the funds, two or three years after their emi&s;&s;ion, and as many before the period of calling them in by ex|change, &s;hould give them a value &s;ix times greater than they bore &s;oon after they were i&s;&s;ued? A per&s;on, who has the lea&s;t tincture of this kind of &s;cience, will an&s;wer in the negative; he will tell you, that the general expectation of their being received by the trea&s;urer at par, created a demand, and rai&s;ed them to a greater value than the mere con&s;ideration of funds could have po&s;&s;ibly conferred; <HI>that where bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of credit are not equal to &s;pecie, by the force of opinion, and there is no immediate demand to make them &s;o, and, at the &s;ame time, there is no di&s;tru&s;t of the funds, or of the public faith, their value can be fixed on no other principle, than that of calculating the pre&s;ent worth of a &s;um of money payable at a future day.</HI> Whenever they attain a va|lue con&s;iderably &s;uperior to this, it mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome immediate or expected u&s;e. In the ca&s;e of the&s;e bills, it has been generally expected, that the &s;tate mu&s;t receive them from its debtors as &s;pecie; take away this expectation, and the proprietors of the bills will be materially affected; com|ply with it, and they will care nothing about the funds. It is ridiculous to imagine, when a man can get &pound;. 100 &s;pecie for &pound;. 106 paper, and when money can command from ten to 20 or 30 per cent. intere&s;t, that he will prefer the board|ing
<PB N="6" REF="018517_0010_0FA7AE533B62FCD8">his paper, and run the hazard of &s;pecie's not being ready at the trea&s;ury, at the time for exchanging it. On the con|trary, there is every rea&s;on to conclude, if my propo&s;itions meet with &s;ucce&s;s, that a very incon&s;iderable &s;um will be left, to redeem with gold and &s;ilver. My plan provides for bring|ing in a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;pecie for the purpo&s;e. Howe|ver, the different periods for redeeming the bills of credit are remote; one will arrive in June 1785, another in May 1786, and the la&s;t in January 1787. We have abundant lei&s;ure to make the experiment, and the legi&s;lature may hereafter make a further provi&s;ion, if, contrary to every rea&s;onable calcula|tion, a further provi&s;ion &s;hould be found requi&s;ite. I will ac|knowledge, that by placing all government &s;ocurities on the &s;ame footing, the value of bills of credit will, in the begin|ning, be inferior to what it has lately been; but by the natural operation of the plan, in a &s;hort time, every &s;pecies of pa|per, as my e&s;timates &s;hall hereafter tend to demon&s;trate, will attain a value very little inferior to &s;pecie.</P>
<P N="2">2. An objection has been thrown out, and will probably be urged, with all the powers of eloquence, again&s;t any fur|ther &s;ales of confi&s;cated property. "In pur&s;uance of an ar|ticle in the definitive treaty, congre&s;s has earne&s;tly recom|mended a re&s;titution of all this property; and our national honour is deeply concerned in adopting this wi&s;e, humane, equitable recommendation." The words of it, which (by the bye) are faithfully copied from the treaty, leave &s;ome doubt re&s;pecting the meaning of the term re&s;titution&punc; If it means more than a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation, we mu&s;t alter our laws, before we can comply; becau&s;e no alien is capable of holding lands in this &s;tate, until he becomes a citizen, under the act for naturalization. A real Briti&s;h &s;ubject is as much an alien, to all intents and purpo&s;es, as a Turk, or a Chine&s;e. This is well known to every per&s;on acquainted with the common law of England, and the con&s;titution of this &s;tate, that law, with re&s;pect to aliens, containing the only rule known to Maryland. By taking the oath, and making the declaration pre&s;cribed by the act for naturaliza|tion, an alien may indeed acquire a capacity of holding lands; but then he no longer mu&s;t con&s;ider him&s;elf a &s;ubject to Great-Britain; becau&s;e he thereby abjures all allegiance to any government, but the &s;tate of Maryland. It cannot be conceived, that Great-Britain, in taking care of the in|tere&s;ts of her &s;ubjects, &s;hould make &s;uch a provi&s;ion, as would, in all probability, oblige them to become citizens of
<PB N="7" REF="018517_0011_0FA7AE57034451A8">America. She could not imagine, that America, contrary to the policy of all nations, would permit aliens to hold real property. Should we incline to adopt the recommendation, my idea is this; the remaining confi&s;cated property mu&s;t be placed on the &s;ame footing with that already &s;old, which can|not be re&s;tored; we mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e of it to the be&s;t advantage, and then find out &s;ome good and &s;ub&s;tantial fund for making a compen&s;ation to every &s;ufferer, without giving any one claimant a preference to another. I would ever prote&s;t again&s;t throwing the mo&s;t valuable property of the &s;tate into this fund; we have much better u&s;es for it. The mea&s;ure of confi&s;cation had always my hearty approbation. I con&s;idered it as founded on natural ju&s;tice, upon policy, and upon ne|ce&s;&s;ity, as every intelligent impartial per&s;on may be convinced, by peru&s;ing the long controver&s;y between the two branches of the legi&s;lature, Nothing has yet turned up to alter the na|ture of things, and Great-Britain has referred the cau&s;e of her unfortunate &s;ubjects and adherents entirely to our gene|ro&s;ity. I can commi&s;erate the ca&s;e of individuals, reduced to deplorable circum&s;tances, by the ambition and crime of their nation; but I cannot admire acts of genero&s;ity, unle&s;s that virtue be di&s;played, without making a &s;acrifice of much more important ones. When we &s;hall have done bare ju&s;tice to the men, who&s;e dangers, toils and &s;ufferings, have &s;ecured our independence; when we &s;hall have made compen&s;ation to our own people, who have &s;uffered by the ravages of the enemy; when we &s;hall have made provi&s;ion for complying with our engagements to our other friends; when we &s;hall have rendered government firm, re&s;pectable and happy; it will be time to pur&s;ue the dictates of a generous, humane, merciful &s;pirit. But, gracious Heaven! what are the men, for who&s;e &s;akes we &s;hould lay burthens on our murmuring, di&s;contented, injured citizens, and withhold ju&s;tice from our benefactors? Is it for parricides, for enemies, for pretended friends, or at be&s;t men, who have viewed our &s;truggles with a cold indifference, that we are to do all this? It is by no means impo&s;&s;ible, that a good citizen of the&s;e &s;tates may pi|ty, forgive, admire, or love &s;ome of the per&s;ons, who fall under this de&s;cription; he may a&s;&s;ociate with them; if they are indigent, he may a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his private fortune; but he will never wi&s;h to &s;acrifice for them the intere&s;ts of his country, or the dear bought rights of his fellow-citizens; it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more than, that all the world, at lea&s;t Great-Britain, fully comprehends what is meant by, what
<PB N="8" REF="018517_0012_0FA7AE5864C92128">will, and what ought to be, the effect of this &s;tipulated re|commendation.</P>
<P>I have propo&s;ed an early &s;ale of confi&s;cated property for two rea&s;ons. The money to ari&s;e from it, whether the plan be adopted or not, is immediately wanted; and it is evident, that &s;uch a &s;ale would be mo&s;t productive. It would an&s;wer little purpo&s;e to demon&s;trate, how much the intere&s;t of the &s;tate has &s;uffered by not &s;elling this property, &s;ome time ago, for every kind of government paper. I am unwilling to ex|amine, at this time, to whom this bad policy is ju&s;tly to be imputed; I will make the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction, that it proceeded from a defect of judgment. Had this mea&s;ure taken place eighteen months ago, the intere&s;ts of the army, as well as tho&s;e of the &s;tate, would have been much better taken care of; and &s;peculation, that bane to commerce, and perhaps to morals, would have been almo&s;t at an end. A blind re&s;entment again&s;t &s;peculators has prevented many &s;a|lutary mea&s;ures, and produced effects directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e intended. A judicious candid &s;peculator will, at once, ridicule the policy, &s;hew what advantages it has given him, and how much it has injured the &s;tate, and its &s;oldiers.</P>
<P N="3">3. I come now to con&s;ider another grand objection to my bill. "It does not di&s;tingui&s;h between depreciation certificates in the hands of the grantees, and tho&s;e which have been, for a trifling con&s;ideration, transferred to &s;peculators." It would perhaps be extremely difficult to a&s;certain what certificates have been transferred, and what not, a very little ingenuity having already defeated other &s;chemes of di&s;crimination. Whether this objection ought to have any weight depends on the &s;oundne&s;s or futility of the arguments adduced in favour of a di&s;crimination; &s;ince the acts, under which the&s;e certi|ficates were i&s;&s;ued, held out no &s;uch idea. They entitle the party to receive a certain &s;um of money, and are either ex|pre&s;sly, or by the &s;tronge&s;t implication, allowed to be a&s;&s;ign|ed, although under certain idle re&s;trictions. Had not the law provided the&s;e re&s;trictions, an a&s;&s;ignment would have given an equitable claim, and placed the a&s;&s;ignee on the &s;ame footing with the &s;oldier, to whom the certificate was granted. By ob&s;erving them, an a&s;&s;ignment has the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature, and we cannot, without a glaring violation of one faith, create any di&s;tinction among the proprietors of the certificates, whether a&s;&s;ignees, or original grantees. E|very act, tending to in&s;pire a di&s;tru&s;t of the laws, mu&s;t have pernicious con&s;equences, as it weakens government, and
<PB N="9" REF="018517_0013_0FA7AE59DEAEA8F8">le&s;&s;ons private credit. In this view, a di&s;crimination would be impolitic; that it would be illegal, arbitrary, uncon&s;titu|tional, and unju&s;t, there needs little further argument to de|mon&s;trate.</P>
<P>It is contended, that the&s;e a&s;&s;ignments &s;hould be declared void by the a&s;&s;embly, and ju&s;tice done to the army. Let it be indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on the mind of every man, who wi&s;hes to di&s;cover the true principles of government, that the public has no right to meddle with the contracts of individuals, un|le&s;s made in violation of a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting law; when that is the ca&s;e, it is not the province of the legi&s;lature to determine; it belongs only to the tribunals of law and equity. I believe, no in&s;tance can be &s;hewn, where the legi&s;lature, in a well regulated free government, has exerci&s;ed the power, except in matters of grand national concern, upon the fulle&s;t con|viction of fraud and delu&s;ion, and where the courts of ju&s;tice were deemed incompetent. Does the ca&s;e of transferred cer|tificates, in any re&s;pect, re&s;emble the infamous South-&s;ea &s;cheme? Is it an affair that intere&s;ts the community? Has there been any cheat or deception? Or, if there has, are our courts of ju&s;tice incompetent? Whether the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h parliament on the memorable occa&s;ion ju&s;t mention|ed, were not too great an infringement of the principles of their con&s;titution, is &s;omewhat problematical. However, the con&s;titution of Maryland in this re&s;pect is more accurately defined; the &s;pirit of it every where, and, in &s;ome parts, the letter, is pointedly again&s;t retro&s;pective laws; it intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a firm and perpetual barrier between the legi&s;lative and judicial departments, and he that propo&s;es to break it down, &s;hould do it to effect &s;ome very &s;alutary purpo&s;e, which at pre&s;ent I cannot di&s;cover.</P>
<P>I have heard of &s;ome men, hardy enough to declare, that transferred certificates ought not to be redeemed at all, or only at the price they co&s;t the purcha&s;er. Their method of delivering the &s;tate from a great part of its debt would indeed be more cheap and compendious than mine, which is ho|ne&s;tly to pay it; the very &s;uppo&s;ition of getting rid of it otherwi&s;e &s;hould excite a general indignation. If an a&s;&s;em|bly &s;hould be found weak enough to frame a re&s;olve for &s;o ba&s;e a purpo&s;e, it would in the end be re&s;cinded; the injured parties, having the con&s;titution, the law, and equity, on their fides, would never cea&s;e to remon&s;trate; indeed a pru|dent legi&s;lature would wait for no &s;olicitation; it would make all convenient ha&s;te to call in the certificates, not on
<PB N="10" REF="018517_0014_0FA7AE59F2A2FF58">account of ju&s;tice only, but becau&s;e, &s;o long as they exi&s;t, the &s;tate is burthened with intere&s;t, and leaves them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> object of &s;peculation.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e the legi&s;lature might di&s;cri|minate without doing wrong, and that it might, with pro|priety, undertake to determine what is ju&s;tice between all parties; &s;tate, &s;oldier, and &s;peculator. Let us &s;uppo&s;e it de|liberating with temper on the mode of relieving the poor pri|vate, who, for a &s;mall pittance, has renounced the hard price of his toils and &s;uffering Shall the &s;tate make him a com|pen&s;ation from the public trea&s;ury? I believe few members would hazard a propo&s;ition, that would open ten thou&s;and mouths again&s;t them. No man within my knowledge has dropped the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; but many have declared, that the &s;peculator ought to be compelled to do ju&s;tice; that the fair way is to pay him, with intere&s;t, the money he advanced, and let the &s;oldier have the re&s;idue; that is, the &s;tate &s;hall owe him &s;o much, and be indebted to the &s;oldier for the balance; the contract, however fairly made, is to be annulled; the purcha&s;er is to find him&s;elf duped by a &s;olemn act of the legi&s;lature; he is &s;tripped of his rights, "without a trial by jury," and without a pre-ex|i&s;ting "law of the land." The&s;e are &s;erious con&s;iderations with me; but I have ob&s;erved them to have little weight with others. Let us then enquire, how far this egregious &s;cheme is practicable; on which of the parties will the legi&s;|lature lay the burthen of proving the con&s;ideration of the &s;ale? Mu&s;t indifferent te&s;timony be required? That we know to be impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e in nine ca&s;es out of ten, there is no witne&s;s, or writing, by which it can be a&s;certained. Shall we admit the oath of the purcha&s;er? It is very probable, if he has dealt a good deal in this way, that, in two ca&s;es out of three, he has no memorandum, or recollection of the pre|ci&s;e &s;um, or thing, he gave; be&s;ides, we &s;hould expo&s;e him to a &s;trong temptation to commit a perjury, which he might con&s;true a pious fraud to &s;ecure a remnant of his rights. Shall we tru&s;t to the oath of the &s;oldier? If he can be &s;o lo&s;t to the &s;entiments of honour, as to take advantage of the law, it cannot be conceived he will entertain a proper &s;en&s;e of the obligation of an oath. Many certificates have pa&s;&s;ed through a variety of hands. Suppo&s;e a man has purcha&s;ed at &s;ix for one, and &s;old to another at four, who has &s;old at three; how &s;hall we contrive to a&s;certain all the&s;e contracts, and do what may be called ju&s;tice to all the parties? The &s;oldier or the
<PB N="11" REF="018517_0015_0FA7AE5AB1C545A0">purcha&s;er may have died, or left the &s;tate; &s;ome &s;oldiers will reject the relief, and the&s;e are the only men who are likely to become good citizens; others will accept it, and the&s;e are the men who di&s;&s;ipate every thing in riot, and will hereafter prove the bane of &s;ociety. In &s;hort, this project of di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice to the army will be found, on the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, to be unju&s;t, impracticable, vi&s;ionary, and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Let us now, with that candour and impartiality which is due to all men, examine what has induced &s;o many humane well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons to advocate a &s;cheme, on which the idea of a di&s;crimination between our creditors has been found|ed. They have conceived, that &s;peculators availed them|&s;elves of the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;oldiers, when they obtained certificates, at a price &s;o far inferior to the &s;um expre&s;&s;ed. But what was the cau&s;e of this? and where does the blame properly lie? The circum&s;tances, under which the certificates were i&s;&s;ued, are well known. Congre&s;s had recommended this mea&s;ure to the &s;tates, as the only expedient that remained for keeping the army on foot. But this &s;alutary purpo&s;e would not have been effected; the clamours of the army would not have been appea&s;ed; the &s;pirit of mutiny and de|&s;ertion would not have &s;ub&s;ided; if the poor naked &s;oldier could not have exchanged his paper for &s;omething, to &s;upply his immediate wants. What was there, in the name of com|mon &s;en&s;e, to &s;tamp a proper value upon it? That patrioti&s;m alone would be a &s;ufficient motive for monied or trading men to purcha&s;e it at par, was a mere Utopian dream; the project which is founded only on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that public &s;pirit is to &s;uper&s;ede the dictates of private intere&s;t, de&s;erves not a &s;erious examination. There were no certain funds, or period fixed for the redemption of this paper; there was no imme|diate u&s;e, and the mode of a&s;&s;ignment was rendered difficult and precarious; it was, notwith&s;tanding, at fir&s;t exchanged at par for the bills of credit then in circulation, which were limited in their duration, and had certain funds for their &s;upport. I would a&s;k any cool rational man, what better could have been expected? The a&s;&s;embly, however, con&s;i|dered this traffic as a &s;hameful impo&s;ition on a meritorious cla&s;s of men, whom Providence had not ble&s;&s;ed with di&s;cre|tion to manage their own concerns; it determined, contrary to its own recent po&s;itive engagement, that certificates alrea|dy transferred &s;hould not be received for certain lands, that were directed to be &s;old, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of redeeming army certificates; and, by way of ju&s;tifying its conduct, eve|ry
<PB N="12" REF="018517_0016_0FA7AE5B6F637C28">opprobrious epithet was applied to a &s;et of men, who had long before been the objects of an undi&s;tingui&s;hing popular re&s;entment. This mode of procedure produced little benefit to the &s;oldier; his nece&s;&s;ities &s;till obliged him to &s;ell; and the legi&s;lature had not deprived him of his power. If, under all the&s;e di&s;couragements, a &s;peculator would hazard the pur|cha&s;e, it is not to be wondered, that he afforded no better terms. In every other contract, he might avail him&s;elf of the advantages of his ready money, his &s;uperior judgment, and of other peoples wants. Very little con&s;ure has fallen on tho&s;e honourable gentlemen, who, at the race of two for one, obtained red money, which was in&s;tantly to be received from them at par for their taxes. I aver, that many re&s;pectable members of the legi&s;lature purcha&s;ed red money at that cruel rate from indigent per&s;ons, who had ju&s;t received it as &s;peci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the &s;tate. Where is the enthu&s;ia&s;tic lover of ju&s;tice, that will propo&s;e a relief in this ca&s;e? And yet if there is a difference between this ca&s;e, and that of transferred certifi|cates, it is by no means in favour of the latter. In both ca&s;es, the &s;ufferer mu&s;t look to the a&s;&s;embly for the authors of their wrongs. But alas! their own acts have put a redre&s;s entirely out of the que&s;tion; the &s;tate cannot make up their lo&s;&s;es, and pay their a&s;&s;ignees the full &s;um be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Of all the numerous objectors to my bill, tho&s;e who talk mo&s;t colourably on the &s;ubject, have argued in this manner; "It is our fixed determination to pre&s;erve public faith, and to pay our creditors of every de&s;cription. It is folly to talk of doing otherwi&s;e; but, if we cannot &s;atisfy them all at once, ought we for that rea&s;on to pay none at all? The path is plain; we will pay as far as we can, and give the prefer|ence, where it is ju&s;tly due." With all proper re&s;pect for high names and &s;uperior talents, the&s;e gentlemen are mi&s;|taken both in principle and fact I cannot perceive, how the officers or &s;oldiers who have retained their certificates have any ju&s;t claim to a di&s;tinction. (They will pardon me for the exerci&s;e of a right, for which I will ever acknowledge my&s;elf pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cipally indebted to them.) They have never been injured by the act of tho&s;e, who have transferred; why then are they to be placed in a better &s;ituation than if not a &s;ingle certificate had been a&s;&s;igned? If we had a &s;um of money in the trea&s;ury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the payment of our debts, and upon adju&s;ting every claim, that &s;um &s;hould be found inadequate, every one to whom a &s;ecurity had been given, or his a&s;&s;ignee, who &s;tands in his place to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;hould come
<PB N="13" REF="018517_0017_0FA7AE5C64F45F78">in for a fair dividend, according to the nature of the public engagements. So much for the principle; but the true &s;tate of matters makes every di&s;pute about the principle quite im|material, becau&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ds belonging to the &s;tate are at lea&s;t equal to its real debts. Should I fail in &s;he proof of this po|&s;ition, I would th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> argue in this way: We are indebted to a variety of creditors, and to a very large amount; we have a variety of debtors, although to not an equal amount; &s;ome of the&s;e debtors are become creditors, by having purcha&s;ed the government &s;ecurities granted to others; &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ecurities have been a&s;&s;igned to per&s;ons not indebted to the &s;tate. Shall we admit the plain, convenient, equitable rule of di&s;count, which prevails between individuals? Or &s;hall we harra&s;s and ruin a debtor, by compelling him to make full payment, whil&s;t he has a liquidated claim, which would more than balance his debt? Shall we make &s;ale of his pro|perty and the property of his &s;ecurities? Shall we commit his body to a gaol, and at the &s;ame time defer our payment to him, ju&s;t as long as we plea&s;e? Again. Shall we at a pro|per period, a&s;&s;ign our debts to our creditors, and thereby gratify both debtors and creditors! Or &s;hall we be at the ri&s;k, trouble, and expence, of collecting from the former, in or|der to &s;atisfy &s;ome of the latter? The whole appears &s;o plain to my under&s;tanding, that if I had not heard oppo&s;ite opi|nions, mo&s;t pertinaciou&s;ly maintained, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to offer a &s;erious argument. I &s;hould expect the &s;ame fate with a preacher, who takes his text, divides and &s;ubdivides his argument, fatigues him&s;elf and his audience, and makes a mighty pother to demon&s;trate what no man in his &s;en&s;es could po&s;&s;ibly deny.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing &s;till that the debts due to the &s;tate, together with the money lying idle in the trea&s;ury, and the remaining confi&s;cated property, are unequal to what &s;he owes, why are we to reject the equitable rule of di&s;count? <HI>(I will not a&s;k, whether it is in our power to reject it.)</HI> Does ju&s;tice between the &s;tate and a citizen differ from ju&s;tice between one citizen and another? If we mean to pay our debts at all, why may we not &s;et about it at once in a way, which will produce no inconvenience to the people? Why may we not, as far as po&s;&s;ible, deliver our affairs from embarra&s;&s;ment, perplexity, ri&s;k, and confu&s;ion? What valuable end is propo&s;ed by de|lay? It would appear to be the &s;tudy of &s;ome politicans, to vex and di&s;quiet every body, that has any dealings with the public. It may an&s;wer &s;ome private contracted view; they
<PB N="14" REF="018517_0018_0FA7AE5FEBC29F18">may for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on enjoy their beloved popularity; the people, who are &s;eldom acquainted with the true &s;ituation of affairs, being told, that the general ea&s;e and advantage has been con&s;ulted, may at fir&s;t hail them as guardians and &s;a|viours; but when they di&s;cover the deception; when they perceive, that a trifling ea&s;e cannot be obtained, without &s;a|crificing the rights of their fellow-citizens, and of their real &s;aviours and benefactors; when they come to experience the evils of a weak and corrupt government; when they have the pro&s;pect of &s;till greater before them; they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ele&s;s and depraved indeed, if they do not execrate the authors of their calamities; they will at length perceive, that virtue is the true ba&s;is of all free government, and that a republic, which is fal&s;e to its own people, and does not watch over the happine&s;s, and guard the rights of all, will &s;oon lo&s;e every thing but the name, and at la&s;t degenerate into de&s;poti&s;m, or &s;ome other wor&s;e &s;pecies of tyranny.</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate how far my plan is likely to produce every end I propo&s;ed, it is time to produce my e&s;timates, which, though not perfectly exact in every particular, were very near the truth on the 14th of February la&s;t, when I received my information from the trea&s;urer and the auditor, and one of the commi&s;&s;ioners, after a careful examination of their books; whatever change has &s;ince taken place, is immaterial; be|cau&s;e no part of the funds can have been dimini&s;hed, with|out al&s;o dimini&s;hing the debt, or providing &s;o much &s;pecie; and no article of the debts can be augmented, without dimi|ni&s;hing the article of unliquidated debts, which with me mu&s;t remain a matter of conjecture, for which I have made a large allowance, but which, there is every rea&s;on to believe, cannot be &s;o great as has been repre&s;ented.</P>

<P>N. B. The&s;e are e&s;timates of the funds and debts as they &s;tood on the 14th of February; the change which has &s;ince taken place, as I &s;aid before, is immaterial. I have not reckoned on the bank &s;tock, which would make a great ad|dition to our funds, about &pound;.40,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018517_0021_0FA7AE63C7A1FEA8">
To &s;ave my&s;elf, and the gentlemen to whom I am indebt|ed for information, a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, I have made only &s;uppo&s;itions with re&s;pect to intere&s;t, taking care, that the balance in favour of the &s;tate &s;hould not exceed the truth. That balance may &s;tand again&s;t unfore&s;een lo&s;&s;es and deductions from the funds, which I have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uffi|cient only to di&s;charge the debts contained in my e&s;timate; in le&s;s than three years my plan, if adopted, will have had its full operation, and the &s;urplus, if any, will again be at the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The certificates given by virtue of the act propo&s;ing to the citizens of this &s;tate, &amp;c. amount to &pound;.92,033 12 0. As we have undertaken to provide for the punctual payment of the intere&s;t of money lent to congre&s;s, and as congre&s;s is thereby relea&s;ed from the burthen, they will certainly permit us to deduct it from our quota of the intere&s;t of the national debt. Should they refu&s;e &s;o rea&s;onable a propo&s;ition, an in|con&s;iderate politician might move for referring this la&s;t of creditors to their original &s;ecurities. Great inconveniencies would re&s;ult from the mea&s;ure; and I do not believe con|gre&s;s would &s;ubject us to &s;o di&s;agreeable a nece&s;&s;ity. That prudent body has always con&s;ulted the welfare of the men, who generou&s;ly lent them money to pro&s;ecute the war, or who placed any reliance on the public faith. Be&s;ides, they would con&s;ider, that our mi&s;take proceeded from an earne&s;t de&s;ire of complying with their ju&s;t requi&s;itions. Should con|gre&s;s view the matter in a different light; &s;hould they tell us no deduction can be made; we can only contribute our full quota, pay the intere&s;t on the&s;e certificates, and carry to the continental trea&s;urer the original loan-office certificates, which now belong to us, and entitle the bearer to the &s;um expre&s;&s;ed, and receive ju&s;t the &s;ame intere&s;t from him. Take it either way, and we are not burthened, in the end, more than if we had not officiou&s;ly taken the place of congre&s;s. Every wi&s;e man would indeed prefer a fair hone&s;t di&s;count to a vexatious circuity of payment.</P>
<P>I have been amu&s;ed at the trouble, &s;ome gentlemen have given them&s;elves, to &s;well the &s;tate debt to a &s;um truly formi|dable. To expo&s;e a mo&s;t egregious impo&s;ition, I &s;hall ex|plain the nature of certain debts, &s;et down in their e&s;timates, which I have not admitted into min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, "we have never fully complied with the requi|&s;itions of congre&s;s, and we &s;hall be indebted about &pound;.400,000 on that &s;core. We owe for the pay of our line in the year
<PB N="18" REF="018517_0022_0FA7AE64838031C8">1782 about &pound;.200,000.

The&s;e &s;everal &s;ums amount to about &pound; 730,000." Not one of them is honoured with a place on my e&s;timate, or provided for in my bill.</P>

<P>How it &s;hould have entered the head of any man, conver|&s;ant with public affairs, that the pay due to our line for 1782 con&s;titutes a part of the &s;tate debt, is difficult to be conceived. We here &s;ee it comprehended in the continental debt; and certificates are now i&s;&s;uing to the officers and &s;oldiers for that pay, and for all that is due be&s;ides upon a final &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to deficiencies in our contributions during the war, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak more fully, to give clear ideas on the &s;ubject. For &s;everal years, congre&s;s made large requi&s;itions, to enable them to carry on the war. Not a &s;in|gle &s;tate contributed, in any one year, its full proportion. It is owing to this, that the national debt exceeds 42,000,000 dollars. Commi&s;&s;ioners are appointed, on behalf of con|gre&s;s, to &s;ettle with each of the &s;tates. The commi&s;&s;ioner, or whoever finally &s;ettles the account with Maryland, will charge u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with our full quota of the whole requi&s;itions, and give us credit for every thing, we have fairly advanced. There will unque&s;tionably be a great balance again&s;t us, per|haps much more than &pound;.400,000. The ca&s;e will be &s;imilar with every other &s;tate. What then is to be done, when all their accounts are finally co&s;ed? Mu&s;t they di&s;charge each its re&s;pective balance, and contribute its quota of the national debt be&s;ides? By no means; for that would be paying twice. What then will be the end of appointing the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners? It will be, to a&s;certain the actual contributions of every &s;tate. If a &s;tate has advanced beyond its proportion of the whole which congre&s;s has received, then congre&s;s will be indebted to it for the exce&s;s. If it has advanced le&s;s than its propor|tion, it will then be indebted to congre&s;s for the deficiency. We have con&s;tantly boa&s;ted of our exertions, we have ac|quired
<PB N="20" REF="018517_0024_0FA7AE661EC56D18">great credit with our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, and I incline to believe, this mighty affair of deficiencies will, at la&s;t, turn out to our advantage.</P>
<P>The whole debt then, not compri&s;ed in my e&s;timate, is our quota of continental bills. With re&s;pect to this, we have managed poorly indeed! We have neglected favourable op|portunities of calling it in, at little expence; and in the end, &s;ome of the &s;tates will perhaps gain an advantage. However, this part of our debt is that about which we may of all others be the lea&s;t &s;olicitous; we may wait, till congre&s;s determines what ought to be done. Should any gentleman be &s;eriou&s;ly of opinion, that this part of our debt ought to be paid as &s;oon as any other; &s;hould he approve my plan in general, and be &s;atisfied of the &s;ufficiency of the funds; let him pro|po&s;e by way of amendment, that debtors be allowed to pay continental bills, at the rate of 140 for one, which is double the value they pa&s;&s;ed at, ju&s;t before they cea&s;ed to circulate; that they be exchanged for bonds; and, when every other purpo&s;e &s;hall have been effected, that the &s;urplus be applied to the buying them up, until the whole of our quota &s;hall be called in.</P>
<P N="5">5. Certain debtors are indulged with a further time, for obvious rea&s;ons. The red money was called out of circula|tion by methods, not pre&s;cribed in the act for its emi&s;&s;ion. It would be idle to allow them to pay any other paper, if we did not afford them a rea&s;onable time to collect it. To let loo&s;e upon them immediately the <HI>vengeance of the law,</HI> would produce deeper &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, than were exhibited during the war. By the law now in force, the money, when col|lected, mu&s;t be locked up, and until a certain period, remain u&s;ele&s;s. Both policy and ju&s;tice, on this occa&s;ion, mu&s;t plead for mercy. Let it not be &s;aid, that, by indulging our debtors from time to time, we only encourage a bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meable remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s. They have had no indulgence, that ought to have been denied. They will exert them&s;elves when there is a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; the purcha&s;ers, who have not entered into bond, will make ha&s;te to complete their contracts, and many will be found in condition to make payment, &s;o &s;oon as we &s;hall allow them to di&s;count government &s;ecurities. I have propo&s;ed another motive for their diligence; after the fir&s;t of January 1785, they may have it in their power to pay only in &s;pecie.</P>
<P N="6">6. It remains to &s;ay &s;omething to an objection, which has had no little weight with tho&s;e, who are &s;atisfied with confi|dent
<PB N="21" REF="018517_0025_0FA7AE66ACC64F90">words, and general expre&s;&s;ions, and cannot bear the fa|tigue of a rational enquiry. It has been a&s;&s;erted, that the pre&s;ent plan originated from malice, and that it is only cal|culated to defeat better mea&s;ures, and to undo all that has been done for retrieving our affairs from di&s;order. I &s;hould be happy to di&s;cover tho&s;e &s;chemes, and to contemplate the pro&s;perous train already &s;aid. The bu&s;ine&s;s &s;urely could not be concealed from an inqui&s;itive eye, from the a&s;&s;embly, and from all the world. In plain and &s;ober truth, there has hi|therto been nothing like &s;y&s;tem, or plan. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crude, indige&s;ted mea&s;ures, &s;pringing from di&s;gu&s;t, from pique, from whim and caprice, have plunged us further and further into difficulties, have di&s;&s;ipated our re&s;ources, and done irreparable injuries to individuals. To prevent further mi&s;chiefs, the bill for the relief of public creditors contain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the only rational, enlarged, comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme, that has yet been propo&s;ed. If it &s;hould not perform every thing I have promi&s;ed, it could not fail to perform a great deal, and the &s;tate would be no further bound, than it already is, to provide ample funds to fulfil all its engagements. No lo&s;s, no di&s;honour, no di&s;advantage, can po&s;&s;ibly flow from the experiment; it is calculated to make the mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent funds; it gives all creditors of the &s;ame de&s;cription an equal chance; it affords a rea&s;onable relief to-debtors; it will con|ciliate the affections of both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of citizens; and it will tend manife&s;tly to <HI>dimini&s;h the expences of government.</HI></P>
<P>From the manner, in which I have urged my propo&s;itions, it will be concluded, that I am deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;cheme. The &s;earcher of all hearts can alone be acquainted with my motives, which are perfectly immaterial in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of a public que&s;tion. I have, however, not the lea&s;t title to a &s;ingle bill of credit, or certificate. I am not in|debted to the &s;tate. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to hazard my charac|ter by &s;peculation. In &s;hort. I have no intere&s;t in the plan, which has employed &s;o much of my attention, except that which may re&s;ult from the general happine&s;s, pro&s;perity, and honour of my country.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to &s;ome con&s;iderations, re&s;pecting our quota of the national debt, the recommendations of congre&s;s, and the relation we bear to that re&s;pectable body.</P>
<P>If I under&s;tand their e&s;timate of the national debt, it a|mounted on the fir&s;t of January la&s;t to 42,000,375 dollars, the intere&s;t of which is 2,415,956 dollars. They have con|jured
<PB N="22" REF="018517_0026_0FA7AE6A06F69F90">the &s;tates, by every con&s;ideration which can affect an hone&s;t mind, to pa&s;s &s;uch acts as will enable them punctually to pay the intere&s;t. They have ventured to recommend a mode called the 5 per cent. impo&s;t, by which the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;um of 915,956 dollars might be rai&s;ed, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e to the people; they have left it to each of the &s;tates to e&s;tabli&s;h ef|fectual funds for &s;upplying its proportion of the re&s;idue, which is 1,500,000 dollars; and they have made the com|pliance of every &s;tate nece&s;&s;ary to give efficacy to the re&s;olu|tions of any. The mode they have pointed out has been re|jected by &s;ome of the &s;tates, and every art is employed, by de&s;igning men, to induce others to re&s;cind the acts, by which they have adopted it. The &s;econd part of their recommenda|tion I believe has been complied with by only two &s;tates in the union. At the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embly, I do not re|collect to have heard it even mentioned. There are three ways, by which this backwardne&s;s in our &s;tate has been ju&s;ti|fied. In the fir&s;t place, "It would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e for one &s;tate to do what the re&s;t have declined." In the next place, "The back lauds claimed by individual &s;tates, of right be|long to the whole, and would alone con&s;titute a fund &s;uffi|cient for the punctual payment of the intere&s;t, and for di&s;|charging within a rea&s;onable time the principal of the whole national debt." Again, "If that fund be inadequate, or be|longs not to congre&s;s, we are not in condition to pay either principal or intere&s;t. As we have done &s;o much for po&s;terity; as we have taken &s;uch care for tran&s;mitting to them the fair inheritance of freedom and independence; it is rea&s;onable, they &s;hould &s;hare the expence." A little &s;ober reflection will convince every rational man, how idle, unju&s;t and di&s;ho|nourable, are all the&s;e excu&s;es and eva&s;ions. In the fir&s;t place; as it is impo&s;&s;ible for thirteen legi&s;latures at the &s;ame in&s;tant to do the &s;ame thing, if each waits for the re&s;t, the requi&s;ition of congre&s;s can never be complied with; but it has redounded much to the honour of tho&s;e &s;tates, which have di&s;covered an ambition to be foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>The "addre&s;s and recommendation to the &s;tates, by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled," from which I extracted the e&s;timate of the national debt, was not duly circulated; there are few who have &s;een it. I &s;hall therefore pre&s;ent another extract for the information of tho&s;e, who may ho|nour the&s;e &s;heets with an attentive peru&s;al.</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="018517_0031_0FA7AE6DA16A6D98">
The national debt does not create the only demand for money. The government of the United States cannot be carried on without it, unle&s;s we could go on for ever upon credit, without taking a &s;ingle &s;tep to &s;atisfy our creditors. I believe that &s;ub&s;tantial re&s;ource congre&s;s, for the pre&s;ent, is deprived of; and it will require a great deal of wi&s;dom in congre&s;s, and in the different legi&s;latures, to regain it. To prevent further requi&s;itions for defraying the expence of its government, for maintaining a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, and for guarding every part of its territory, congre&s;s is obliged to depend on further loans. The back lands may hereafter con&s;titute a fund for di&s;charging the new debt, and for pro|viding again&s;t contingencies. A &s;ub&s;tantial fund for this latter purpo&s;e ought undoubtedly to be ve&s;ted in the &s;overeign power of a republic, which has no authority, upon any emer|gency, to levy money by taxation, without the con&s;ent of thirteen other deliberative bodies. Congre&s;s has however engaged to apply the revenue to ari&s;e from the back lands to ha&s;ten the extingui&s;hment of the national debt; and, &s;ince neither congre&s;s as a body, nor its members as indivi|duals, can have any motive for acting contrary to the true intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents, they will perform the engagement whenever it can be done with &s;afety and pro|priety.</P>
<P>To talk of leaving to po&s;terity the burthen of the debt con|tracted during the war, is truly ridiculous. I have no pre|ci&s;e idea of what is meant by the po&s;terity of a &s;tate. The term, when applied to an individual, every body compre|hends. I &s;hould be glad to know what proportion of the in|dividuals compo&s;ing this republic, or whether the whole, mu&s;t quit this earthly &s;tage, before the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of po&s;terity is to commence. To refer our creditors entirely to po&s;terity, would be little more than a declaration, that they never &s;hall be paid; for, if we entertain &s;o poor a &s;en&s;e of our obliga|tions, they and their repre&s;entatives can have little depend|ence on our po&s;terity. Be&s;ides, po&s;terity mu&s;t, at all events, bear the burthen of the e&s;tabli&s;hments we now make. They mu&s;t, perhaps for a long time, pay the intere&s;t of the debt, and at la&s;t find means to extingui&s;h the principal. Added to this, they may have troubles and burthens enough of their own. It was the wicked, ungenerous policy of anticipating the public revenue, and entailing debts upon po&s;terity, which has wrought &s;o many evils to Great-Britain, and laid the foundation for the di&s;memberment of their empire; and it is

<P>Let us now a&s;certain our proportion of the intere&s;t of the national debt. If 141,517 dollars are our &s;hare of 1,500,000, then 227 999&frac15;, equal to &pound;.85,499 13 0, is our quota of the whole.

Suppo&s;e another &s;tate to have gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a &s;um for the payment of our illu&s;trious and generous ally; it is ea&s;y to perceive how inconvenient it would be, for congre&s;s to aban|don its own &s;y&s;tems, to gratify the whims of each di&s;tinct legi&s;|lature. This "one half of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment" was voted without any regard to our quota of the whole debt, or of the amount of either principal or intere&s;t of the army debt; it was merely arbi|trary; it might have been more, or le&s;s; it was given una&s;ked; we did not know that other &s;tates would pa&s;s &s;imilar acts, or that the officers and &s;oldiers of the Maryland line would derive any material benefit. I am not at all oppo&s;ed to the tran&s;mitting this money to congre&s;s; they have abundant u&s;es for it; it may come &s;ea&s;onably to an&s;wer &s;ome occa&s;ional purpo&s;e; they may con&s;ider it as a free gift, or give us credit for it in our account current; but it will not &s;upport the honour and good faith of the con&s;ederacy, give &s;atisfaction to creditors, or convince the world, that we have done our duty.</NOTE> An annual contribution, to be rai&s;ed by a new law every year, would never an&s;wer the views of congre&s;s; it is impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="31" REF="018517_0035_0FA7AE7674958088">for them, without &s;ub&s;tantial, effectual, and certain re|venues, to e&s;tabli&s;h a new credit, or to afford any &s;ecurity to their pre&s;ent creditors. An annual contribution mu&s;t depend on the will of every new legi&s;lature in thirteen different &s;tates, who, upon every little pique or idle jealou&s;y, might with|hold their &s;upplies, embarra&s;s our affairs, and endanger the union. No man in his &s;en&s;es would lend money to congre&s;s, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, or accept an a&s;&s;ignment of its a&s;|&s;urances, on terms advantageous to its creditors. We have &s;ufficiently experienced, how little regard a new legi&s;lature pays to the engagements of the la&s;t, how differently it views the &s;ame &s;ubject, and how vilely the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances have been pro&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The rate, I have thus propo&s;ed to lay upon real property, would be inferior to what has been laid on all property, for &s;everal years. By the la&s;t valuation, the whole of real pro|perty amounted to &pound;.6,303,143 17 10&frac12;; the rate of 18 &s;hillings on &pound;.100 would produce the gro&s;s &s;um of &pound;.57,000. I conceive, however, that if real property were fairly e&s;ti|mated, it would amount to at lea&s;t &pound;.12,000,000; a rate of 9&s;6 on &pound;.100 would in that ca&s;e be &s;ufficient; but whether the propo&s;ed valuation &s;hould prove higher, or lower, than the pre&s;ent, it would make no manner of difference to land|holders in general; for &s;hould the valuation be higher, the rate mu&s;t be lower; and, &s;hould the valuation be lower, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e

<P>I take it to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed point, that, impo&s;e what tax you plea&s;e, the party, who is immediately charged, contrives to throw the burthen upon others. It comes round to all; and, at la&s;t, every one is compelled to bear his proportion. In &s;ome ca&s;es, indeed, the party even derives an advantage. However, to conciliate the fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur of tho&s;e, who cannot com|prehend the&s;e po&s;itions, I would not, for any purpo&s;e what|ever, propo&s;e a further tax upon real property.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t ungrateful part of my undertaking remains behind. As it was my original intention to give the citizens of this &s;tate ample information re&s;pecting the &s;ituation of their affairs, I cannot omit to &s;ay &s;omething re&s;pecting the expences of our own internal government.</P>

<P>This &s;um is to maintain thirty-two per&s;ons, many of whom are expected to po&s;&s;e&s;s talents, which would render them eminent in any private employment; they mu&s;t re&s;ide at the &s;eat of government; and "dedicate their time, abilities, and labour, to the public." Could &s;ociety &s;ub&s;i&s;t without government, or could government be conducted without de|legating power to individuals; or, if it were rea&s;onable that the&s;e individuals &s;hould <HI>be&s;tow</HI> their "time, abilities, and labour;" or, if patrioti&s;m would alone be a &s;ufficient motive for others, equal or &s;uperior in merit, to execute the trou|ble&s;ome, expen&s;ive, and invidious offices of &s;tate; there would indeed be ju&s;t cau&s;e to clamour again&s;t even the mo&s;t &s;canty allowance, as every farthing &s;aved would be &s;ome di|minution of the burthens of the people. But, as civilized &s;ociety never did, or can exi&s;t, without government; as go|vernment cannot be carried on by all the per&s;ons compo&s;ing &s;ociety; as the power of admini&s;tering the laws mu&s;t re&s;ide in a few; as the public has no right to expect, the whole burthen &s;hould be borne by a few, without a &s;uitable reward; as the &s;hare, which each man in the community contributes to this reward, is &s;o exceedingly light; how are we to ac|count for the endeavours of &s;o many leading men, to exhibit the officers of government in &s;uch odious colours to the peo|ple? It is ea&s;y to account for their &s;ucce&s;s; the people have ever wanted information; they have been taught to believe, that if it were not for the accur&s;ed civil li&s;t, they would have no rea&s;on to dread the frequent vi&s;its of a collector; that al|mo&s;t every farthing extracted from their pockets, the fruit of hone&s;t indu&s;try, is dealt out to a few idle men, who are ri|oting in luxury, at the capital, and, at the &s;ame time, ac|cumulating fortunes for their de&s;cendants. It is devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that the people would think more for them&s;elves, that they would learn to rea&s;on, and calculate, and that ex|perience would teach them to di&s;tru&s;t the men, who &s;olicit their &s;uffrages, under the &s;pecious pretences of con&s;ulting their intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="018517_0038_0FA7AE7CCCA85758">
About &pound;.11,330,000 being the valuation of all the pro|perty within the &s;tate, although far inferior to the actual worth, it will require 17 pence in the &pound;.100 to pay the civil li&s;t and delegates in congre&s;s. An e&s;tate, then, which is va|lued at &pound;.1000, contributes to this purpo&s;e 14&s;2. He mu&s;t be a &s;trange &s;en&s;ele&s;s being, who, for this, is di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider government as a cur&s;e rather than a ble&s;&s;ing; and he mu&s;t be totally ignorant of the nature of our government who &s;uppo&s;es, that its officers will contrive to engro&s;s the whole 15 &s;hillings tax, to be rai&s;ed by the &s;upply bill.</P>
<P>I doubt not, that great merit will, by &s;ome well meaning, ill informed per&s;ons, be a&s;cribed to the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly for their &s;ingular oeconomy. Any man that will in&s;pect the acts and re&s;olutions of each a&s;&s;embly, and calculate the value of paper money at the different periods when it was paid, will be convinced, that the pre&s;ent &s;alaries are nearly double the average allowances, &s;ince the revolution; that this article of our expenditures created but a &s;mall part of the demands of government; and that the people have not, on this account, one year with another, been taxed more than nine-pence in the &pound;.100, on a very low valuation of their property. Let him go further, and e&s;timate the expence of living during the whole time, and he will perceive that an officer, &s;o far from &s;aving money, could not, by the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on double his allowance, agreeably to his &s;ta|tion, even "in this petty republic." When he looks round, and &s;ees the daily increa&s;e of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation; when he reflects, that at this period, an univer&s;al rage for wealth has &s;eized all ranks and orders of men, that no &s;tation, ta|lent, or character, can command re&s;pect without at lea&s;t a decent competence; he will hardly expect men of real worth, for a paltry allowance, to occupy the laborious, trouble&s;ome offices of government, and thereby exclude them&s;elves from the emolument of private employments. It will be too much to look for inflexible integrity in the &s;ervants of the public. Nece&s;&s;ity will perpetually urge them; and they mu&s;t renounce either their virtue, or their places; the mo&s;t worthle&s;s cha|racters will &s;ucceed them, and the public, in the end, will be lo&s;er by an ill judged par&s;imony. This ob&s;ervation mu&s;t &s;trike every one, that it would be infinitely better to employ an hone&s;t intelligent &s;teward, at a liberal &s;tipend, than tru&s;t to a knave or a fool, and pay him no wages at all.</P>
<P>The whole amount of &s;alaries does not equal a moiety of what was paid by the people of this &s;tate to the late proprie|tary,
<PB N="35" REF="018517_0039_0FA7AE7FCB820798">and his lieutenant-governor. It does not equal the contributions of a &s;ingle town to the &s;upport of a theatre. I will acknowledge the &s;uperior merit of the gentlemen, who "hold the mirror up to nature." They afford us an elegant, agreeable, rational entertainment. By their conduct in pri|vate life, and the excellent le&s;&s;ons they inculcate on the &s;tage, they cannot fail to improve our ta&s;te, refine our manners, and promote indu&s;try, &s;obriety, oeconomy, and every other concomitant virtue. But the poor officers of government re|quire food, habitation, and raiment, as well as they. Is it po&s;&s;ible, without &s;pleen, to hear a man exclaiming bitterly again&s;t the civil li&s;t, becau&s;e he is compelled to contribute about the 2000th part of his property to their &s;upport, whil&s;t he cheerfully lays out 10, 20, or 30 times the &s;um at the theatre. The bare recital of his conduct is a &s;ufficient &s;atire on his under&s;tanding and principles.</P>
<P>It is alleged that offices are multiplied without nece&s;&s;ity. Perhaps the public might &s;u&s;tain no injury by aboli&s;hing a part, and by &s;o doing the &s;um total of &s;alaries might, upon the pre&s;ent &s;aving plan, be reduced to le&s;s than &pound;.7000. But after every reform, which prudence might dictate, &pound;.10,000 could not, by any cool, di&s;cerning, rational man, be thought too much for the maintenance of the officers, who ought to be left. This would require an e&s;tate valued the la&s;t year at &pound;.1000, to pay annually about 17&s;6, in&s;tead of 14&s;2, which it pays at pre&s;ent; and any worthy proprietor of &s;uch an e&s;tate would con&s;ent to pay the difference, if he reflects, that this trifling addition to his tax would convert a &s;ordid, illiberal, contemptible e&s;tabli&s;hment, into one that is decent and re&s;pectable, and at the &s;ame time would give the be&s;t &s;e|curity for the faithful admini&s;tration of the laws.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h not to conceal the intere&s;t I have in this bu&s;ine&s;s. It is clo&s;ely connected with that of the public. I have more than once, with the freedom which becomes a republican, expre&s;&s;ed to the a&s;&s;embly a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the injuries I had &s;u&s;tained, by repeated infractions of public engagements, and a total di&s;regard to the principles of the con&s;titution. To the man, who will attempt to combat plain rea&s;oning and hone&s;t claims, by ridicule and &s;arca&s;m, I will only &s;ay, that he has an unfeeling heart, and a happy front. However, let the public re&s;pect liquidated claims in which I have no concern; let it in other things con&s;ult its own honour and intere&s;t, and I will, without a murmur, &s;ubmit to my lo&s;s, and give every claim of compen&s;ation to the winds.</P>

There is one demand for money, to which, it would &s;eem, every other mu&s;t &s;ubmit. The le&s;s opulent members of the a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t punctually receive their pay, at the clo&s;e of every &s;e&s;&s;ion. The citizens of this &s;tate are not generally ap|prized, that the expence of holding the a&s;&s;embly has, every year, exceeded the allowance to civil officers; and yet not even the pre&s;ent increa&s;ed allowance to its own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embers can, by any means, be deemed extravagant. To the defect of &s;y&s;tem, to the derangement of our affairs, and to the non-at|tendance of members, is to be imputed the extreme length of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and the inefficacy of mea&s;ures. When we &s;hall have &s;ettled our affairs (a work, which diligence and a real zeal for public good might &s;oon accompli&s;h) I cannot think tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> journals of accounts, which comprehend the pay of a&s;|&s;embly-men, general court jurors, and witne&s;&s;es, and &s;undry incidental charges, could annually exceed the &s;um of &pound;.10,000. But let us &s;uppo&s;e the annual expence, of go|vernment, including a provi&s;ion for contingencies, with the charg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ection, to amount to &pound;.24,000; fines, for|feitures, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax on legal proceedings, marriage and tavern licences, with &s;ome other trifling duties, and a rea|&s;onable rate on per&s;onal property, would furni&s;h that &s;um without the lea&s;t difficulty.</P>
<P>It is generally agreed, that the pre&s;ent valuation of pro|perty by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors is far inferior to the actual worth. Should we e&s;timate from the extravagant &s;ales upon long credit, the value of all the private property within the &s;tate would a|mount to at lea&s;t &pound;.30,000,000. The real value, calcu|lating from ready money prices, and &s;ales upon &s;hort cre|dit, where the purcha&s;er may be depended on, is at lea&s;t &pound;.20,000 000. I have &s;hown that our quota of the intere&s;t of the national debt amounts to &pound;.85,409 13 0. The gro&s;s &s;um of &pound;91,000 might be required on this account. The annual expences of our government cannot exceed &pound;.24,000. The county tax amounts in the whole &s;tate to about &pound;.20,000. The&s;e &s;everal &s;ums make the aggregate &s;um o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &pound;.135,000 13 0; and each man's proportion is the price he is to be charged with for protection in his life, freedom, and pro|perty. This la&s;t &s;um bears about the &s;ame proportion to &pound;.20,000,000, as 13&s;6 does to &pound;.100. A man then who is worth &pound;.1000, to contribute his ju&s;t quota to congre&s;s, to the &s;tate, and to his county, mu&s;t annually pay &pound;.6 15 0, which is about one ninth of the legal intere&s;t of mo|ney.</P>

<P>The great objects upon which I have &s;o largely, although imperfectly di&s;cour&s;ed, demand the in&s;tant attention of the legi&s;lature.

The uncertainty of the law in gene|ral, the inefficacy of the penal laws, the di&s;proportion be|tween crimes and puni&s;hment, the delays of ju&s;tice, the want of regulations in our commerce; all the&s;e are evils which de|mand an early attention, with the utmo&s;t care, circum&s;pec|tion, and &s;ome in&s;ight into the laws and regulations of other nations. I am amazed, when I hear it &s;aid, at the opening of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the a&s;&s;embly has little to do. I am amazed at the little value my countrymen place on the right of &s;uffrage.
