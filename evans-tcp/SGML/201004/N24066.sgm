<HEAD>STATE OF FACTS, RELATING TO THE GEORGIA LANDS.</HEAD>
<Q><P>UNDER the term of GEORGIA WESTERN TERRITORY is included all that part of the State of Georgia, which dies we&s;t of the head waters of tho&s;e rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean. The&s;e lands are principally inhabited by three na|tions of Indians, the Chactaws, the Chicka&s;aws, and the Creeks,&mdash;of which nations the following is a &s;ummary character.</P>
<P>THE Chactaws, or flat-heads, are a powerful, har|dy, &s;ubtle and intrepid race of Indians, who inhabit a very fine and exten&s;ive tract of hilly country, with large and fertile plains intervening between the Al|abama and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi rivers. They have about 40 towns and villages, and 4000 fighting men.&mdash;They have large plantations or country farms, where they employ much of their time in agricultural improve|ments, after the manner of white people.</P>
<P>THE Chicka&s;aws are a nation of Indians, who in|habit the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, on the head branches of the Tombeckbe, Mobille and Yazoo rivers. Their country is an exten&s;ive plain, tolerably well watered from &s;prings, and of a pretty good &s;oil. They have 7 towns, and their number of &s;ighting men is e&s;timated at 575.</P>
<P>THE Greeks inhabit the middle part of Georgia. They eminently de&s;erve the encomium of all nations for their wi&s;dom and virtue in expelling the u&s;e of
<PB N="4" REF="031830_0004_0FEEC77599304DA0"><HI>&s;piritous liquors.</HI> The fir&s;t and mo&s;t cogent article in all their treaties with the white people, is, that there &s;hall not be any kind of &s;piritous liquors &s;old or brought into their towns.&mdash;In&s;tances have fre|quently occurred, on the di&s;covery of attempts to run kegs of &s;pirits into the country, of the Indians &s;triking with their tomahawks tho&s;e who attempted it, and giving the liquor to the &s;and, not ta&s;ting of it them&s;elves. It is difficult to account for their ex|cellent policy in civil government: it cannot derive its efficacy from coercive laws; for they have no &s;uch artificial &s;y&s;tem. They have 55 towns, be&s;ide many villages, and their fighting men are about 5800.&mdash;They are a well-made, expert, hardy, &s;aga|cious, politic people; extremely jealous of their rights, and <HI>aver&s;e to parting with their lands.</HI> They have abundance of tame cattle and &s;wine, turkies, ducks and other poultry. They cultivate tobacco, rice, Indian corn, potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage, me|lons, and have a plenty of peaches, plumbs, grapes, &s;trawberries and other fruits. They are faithful friends, but inveterate enemies; ho&s;pitable to &s;tran|gers, and hone&s;t and fair in their dealings. <HI>No na|tion has a more contemptible opinion of the white men's faith in general, than the&s;e people: yet they place great confidence in the United States, and wi&s;h to agree with them upon a permanent boundary, over which the &s;ou|thern States &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s.</HI> The country which they claim, is bounded northward by about the 34th degree of latitude, and extends from the Tombeckbe or Mobille river to the Atlantic ocean (though they have ceded a part of this tract on the &s;ea coa&s;t, by different treaties, to the &s;tate of Georgia.)</P>
<P>OF this we&s;tern territory, thus inhabited, the &s;tate of Georgia by act of their legi&s;lature, pa&s;&s;ed January 7th, 1795, &s;old about twenty-two millions of acres, to four different companies&mdash;viz.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="031830_0005_0FEEC779042DFA10">
ONE tract to James Gunn, Matthew M'Alli&s;ter and George Walker, and their a&s;&s;ociates, called, <HI>The Georgia Company.</HI></P>
<P>ONE tract to Nicholas Long, Thomas Gla&s;scock, Ambro&s;e Gordon and Thomas Cummings, and their a&s;&s;ociates, called, <HI>The Georgia Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Company.</HI></P>
<P>ONE tract to John B. Scott, John C. Nightingale and Wade Hampton, called, <HI>The Upper Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Company.</HI></P>
<P>ONE tract to Zechariah Coxe, Mathias Maher, and their a&s;&s;ociates, called, <HI>The Tene&s;&s;ee Company.</HI></P>
<P>HALF a million of dollars was the purcha&s;e mo|ney:&mdash;this, or the greate&s;t part of it, was &s;ecured by mortgages, which have been &s;ince cancelled.&mdash; But the &s;tate of Georgia now reclaims the&s;e tracts of land, alledging that the act authorizing the &s;ale, is contrary to the 4th article of the con&s;titution of the United States; repugnant to the 16th and 17th &s;ections of the 1&s;t article of the con&s;titution of Geor|gia; and was moreover obtained by means of fraud, atrocious &s;peculation, corruption and collu&s;ion.&mdash; Hence, by an act pa&s;&s;ed February 13th, 1796, the afore&s;aid act of January 7th, 1795, was declared null and void, and the grants, rights and claims de|duced from it, annulled and rendered void and of no effect.</P></Q>
<P>THUS far my &s;tatement is probably correct, being mo&s;tly taken from Doctor Mor&s;e's American Gazet|teer.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the time of pa&s;&s;ing the granting act in January, 1795, and of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;cinding act in February, 1796, a great portion of the&s;e lands were alienated by the Companies, and became the property of purcha&s;ers in the middle and ea&s;tern &s;tates. The&s;e &s;ales were effected under the influence of a certain pamphlet, entitled, <Q><HI>State of facts, &s;hewing the right of certain companies to the lands, lately purcha&s;ed by
<PB N="6" REF="031830_0006_0FEEC781F40D0320">them from the &s;tate of Georgia,</HI></Q> and under the in|fluence of certain other means, which will be noticed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e numbers.</P>
<P>To &s;ave the inconvenience of frequent references and quotations in the following pages, it may be well to inform the reader, that relying on the &s;tatement of facts, publi&s;hed by the Georgia companies, I verily be|lieved (till after the re&s;cinding act) that the <HI>&s;ee</HI> of the lands &s;old to the companies and by them to us, had been extingui&s;hed by the &s;tate of Georgia; but that the Indians had a right of hunting and fi&s;hing, which would in time be abdicated or ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed; as &s;uch a kind of right had formerly exi&s;ted in this colo|ny, and had been virtually recognized in the &s;everal treaties with different tribes. But after the re&s;cinding act, it appeared that the right of the &s;tate of Georgia to the <HI>fee,</HI> was ju&s;t &s;uch a right as the &s;tate of North Carolina had &s;et up to Indian lands; but which had been negatived unanimou&s;ly by a committee of Con|gre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a member from each of the &s;tates. It al&s;o appeared that this &s;etting up of a <HI>&s;ee</HI> was point|edly oppo&s;ed to the uniform policy of the United States, to the uniform declarations of Congre&s;s, and to the treaty with the Creek nation, concluded Augu&s;t 7th, 1790.</P>
<P>As the <HI>fee</HI> which was the &s;ub&s;tance of all the&s;e &s;ales had failed entirely and did not exi&s;t, and as much mo|ney had been paid, and many notes been given, it be|came important to enquire whether the right of pre|emption was worth any thing.&mdash;On enquiry it appeared that the &s;tate of Georgia had a very <HI>que&s;tionable right</HI> to purcha&s;e lands (of three Indian tribes, who had no di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ell them) whenever Congre&s;s, (who de|nied the exi&s;tence of this right) &s;hould grant them li|berty to hold a treaty. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Con|necticut rights of preemption were undi&s;puted, and they contemplated lands, which the policy of the U|nited
<PB N="7" REF="031830_0007_0FEEC789502D8290">States would ju&s;tify them in purcha&s;ing, and which the right owners were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ell; but the numbers, characters and &s;ituation of the&s;e three na|tions, combined with the policy of the United States, pre&s;ented a very powerful contra&s;t in the&s;e Georgia lands. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, it occurred to me, that if the Creek nation had &s;old to Long, Gla&s;scock and others, their right of preemption to the &s;tate of Georgia, or the &s;tate of Connecticut, I &s;hould as readi|ly have been an a&s;&s;ignee of the claim, as with a know|ledge of facts, have been a purcha&s;er under the Geor|gia companies.</P>
<P>BUT the re&s;cinding act led up &s;ome ideas about fraud, atrocious &s;peculation, corruption and collu&s;ion, practi&s;ed on the legi&s;lature, which led me to con&s;ider whether &s;ome &s;uch practices had not been adopted at the northward as well as the &s;outhward; and on en|quiry, it appeared that &s;ome of the agents of the Geor|gia companies had conducted honorably&mdash;and have not any intention of profits in this unfortunate and de|lu&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s:&mdash;but that others had eminently &s;u&s;|tained the characters of fraud and deceit in &s;elling, which they had acquired in purcha&s;ing.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e premi&s;es it appeared to me that men who take money or notes for that which proves to be nothing, e&s;pecially under the above circum&s;tances, ought to refund.&mdash;And this &s;entiment, if true, will o|perate in favor of all, thro' who&s;e hands the&s;e lands have pa&s;&s;ed, back to the members of the fir&s;t compa|nies; and the re&s;cinding act has recognized this &s;enti|ment, by providing that the fir&s;t companies may re|ceive back the money paid, and no one can oppo&s;e the operation of it, but tho&s;e who are watching to make fortunes out of the nothingne&s;s of this Georgia bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and this number I hope (for the honor of hu|manity) is very &s;mall.</P>
<P>REPEATED di&s;clo&s;ure of the&s;e opinions has led me
<PB N="8" REF="031830_0008_0FEEC78AF3690E78">to hear much logic and law-learning upon this &s;ubject &mdash;much cen&s;ure upon the &s;tate of Georgia&mdash;many re|marks upon what the legi&s;lature might, could, or ought to have done.&mdash;But though my attention has been of|ten &s;u&s;pended by the eloquence of great and learned men, on the &s;ubject; yet no one has convinced me that the <HI>right of the &s;tate of Georgia to buy land</HI> of the Creeks, Chicka&s;aws and Chactaws was ever worth a farthing.&mdash;No one has convinced me that the &s;tate e|ver had &s;uch right.&mdash;No one has proved that the fee of lands, and a right to buy the fee, are the &s;ame thing. Amid&s;t the variety of opinions and the indefinite &s;tate of this bu&s;ine&s;s, I have ventured to throw out the fol|lowing di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as the re&s;ult of my own conviction; and have &s;ub&s;cribed it for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of a|voiding that confu&s;ion, which often re&s;ults from ano|nymous publications.</P>

<HEAD>Georgia Speculation Unveiled.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">No. I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LET the buyer look out,</HI> is a maxim &s;uppo&s;ed appli|cable to all contracts where land is named;&mdash; but to the northern &s;ales of Georgia land it can have no application; for the&s;e are not &s;ales of <HI>land,</HI> as facts now &s;hew; and by the &s;ellers were not intended to be &s;ales of <HI>land,</HI> but a mere floating imaginary right to buy land&mdash;which partakes no more of reality than a right to buy goods or hor&s;es. The right to buy In|dian land is at be&s;t no more than a chattel, and is a perfect non-de&s;cript, unknown to all the writers upon real e&s;tate. It originated in avarice and power, and never, <HI>in this in&s;tance,</HI> has gained any other exi&s;tence than on paper.</P>
<P>THE State of Georgia claimed a right in fee to cer|tain lands,&mdash;which lands were in fact &s;ubject to an ab|&s;olute fee-&s;imple, in the right owners,&mdash;and &s;aid &s;tate acknowledged this fee, &s;ubject to a particular kind of u&s;ufruct&mdash;which u&s;ufruct was the ab&s;olute undi&s;puted dominion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e owners, with an an|cient, inherent and interminable right of doing with it as they plea&s;ed, without any hindrance or mole&s;ta|tion from this claimant:&mdash;and this fee, dominion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the right owners, guaranteed by the Uni|nited States, and &s;ecured by &s;evere laws from all fraud and force on the part of the preemptors:&mdash;and to crown all, this &s;ame preemption claimed over the heads of this &s;ame &s;tate of Georgia by the United States, who have an uncontrolable right to decide by judicial offi|cers
<PB N="10" REF="031830_0010_0FEEC78F65335890">of their own creation on the right of preemption: &mdash;and again, this u&s;urped preemption of the &s;tate of Georgia, &s;ecured from inva&s;ion by their own con&s;titu|tion and po&s;itive laws, and guarded again&s;t fraud and deceit by all tho&s;e general maxims which obtain and are recognized in all &s;overeign &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE mind of man can proceed but one &s;tep further, and yet retain one idea of lands or claims; and this &s;tep is pre&s;ented in the kind of right, which the Geor|gia companies claim to the&s;e lands. By the force of fraud and corruption (as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter) they have broken through all the barriers, which &s;o perfect|ly &s;ecured the fee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the right owners&mdash; and after obtaining the &s;emblance of a granting act, came forward, and by a printed pamphlet, entitled, <HI>"State of Facts,"</HI> &amp;c. declared to all the world, that they were the true and lawful a&s;&s;ignees of the <HI>fee</HI> of tho&s;e lands, and to all the u&s;es of it, except a particu|lar kind of u&s;ufruct, called a right of hunting and fi&s;h|ing of the Indians. Not one of the attributes of their claim was of nece&s;&s;ity a matter of record; and the land could not from its &s;ituation promi&s;e to any pur|cha&s;er under them an office of record, where he might re&s;ort for evidence of title;&mdash;therefore every thing in|ducing a &s;ale mu&s;t be from the &s;eller, and in all &s;uch ca&s;es, <HI>let the &s;eller look out, that he deceive not the buyer.</HI> 'Tis a maxim of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, that what|ever inducements the &s;eller improves to draw money from the buyer he &s;hall make true, or &s;uffer the in|convenience of their proving fal&s;e; for if he has tak|en money for his own fal&s;hoods, he ought to re&s;und it, whenever equity and good con&s;cience demand it.&mdash; And if this rule is not in the books, it ought to be pla|ced there, by the &s;ide of <HI>caveat emptor.</HI> Both parties are to look out; all men are to look out; <HI>but courts are e&s;pecially to look out, and &s;ee that men get no gain by cheating their neighbours;</HI>&mdash;and if in every ca&s;e they
<PB N="11" REF="031830_0011_0FEEC7924E7DB780">cannot find a precedent for doing right, let them, as Lord Hardwicke did, make a precedent.</P>
<P>THE frauds practi&s;ed in the negociation and &s;ales of the&s;e Georgia lands, have been as numerous and com|plicated as the heart of man could conceive; and the property now re&s;ting for deci&s;ion of the courts in con|&s;equence of them, is to an immen&s;e amount. The re&s;cinding act of the &s;tate of Georgia has brought all the&s;e matters to a cri&s;is, and one deci&s;ion of the &s;u|preme court of the United States, may probably in|fluence the deci&s;ions of lower courts. I &s;hall there|fore proceed to di&s;cu&s;s,&mdash;1&s;t. the validity of this re&s;|cinding act&mdash;2d. the impo&s;&s;ibility of affecting it by any court or power in the United States&mdash;and 3d. the con|&s;equence upon all the notes depending on the &s;ales un|der the granting act.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE validity of the re&s;cinding act depends on the power which pa&s;&s;ed it.&mdash;This is the &s;overeign indepen|dent &s;tate of Georgia, having a right to make or re|peal their own laws at plea&s;ure, and this right wholly uncontrolable. When individuals deal with each o|ther, there are courts to compel compliance with their contracts:&mdash;how far the policy of the United States will &s;u&s;tain a citizen in a di&s;pute again&s;t a &s;tate, for mo|nies due on &s;tate notes, or otherwi&s;e acknowledged; and whether a mar&s;hall may &s;afely commit to pri&s;on the governor, trea&s;urer or &s;ecretary of the &s;tate for a &s;tate debt, is be&s;ide my pre&s;ent object. This was a grant &s;aid to be &s;tanding on records, whereof the legi&s;|lature had the control. The&s;e records do not now ex|i&s;t;&mdash;they are burnt, and the rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned on new records for de&s;troying the &s;ame. I a&s;k, what re|medy have the Georgia companies? They cannot bring a writ of ejectment; for none but the Indians are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;They cannot &s;ue for the lands, but in the &s;tate where the lands lie;&mdash;and whatever court tries the cau&s;e, mu&s;t try it by the exi&s;ting laws of the &s;tate
<PB N="12" REF="031830_0012_0FEEC796A8C63798">of Georgia; and no law exi&s;ts in favor of the compa|nies.&mdash;Copies of record will not an&s;wer: if they would, a &s;ecretary might certify what on trial would eject all the people of a &s;tate from every foot of their land. The exi&s;ting laws mu&s;t be &s;uch as are recognized by the people, legally repre&s;ented; and the legal repre|&s;entatives mu&s;t have a right to declare their &s;en&s;e of the laws.</P>
<P>IN various ca&s;es a legi&s;lature may declare a pretend|ed act void&mdash;as whenever 'tis contrary to con&s;titution &mdash;as where a le&s;s number was pre&s;ent at pa&s;&s;ing it, than is required to form a hou&s;e&mdash;or where the &s;peak|er or pre&s;ident of the council was bribed to declare that a vote, which was not a vote; or where the voters in favor of an act were intere&s;ted in the pa&s;&s;ing of it; or where it was pa&s;&s;ed by members not having taken the nece&s;&s;ary oaths; and in all ca&s;es, where fraud and deceit are combined between tho&s;e who compo&s;e the legi&s;lature, and tho&s;e who are to be benefited by any particular act. Take this power from a legi&s;lature, and where is the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate?&mdash;Such a powerle&s;s &s;tate would be left open to the ravages of all the unprincipled men in the univer&s;e, and their prop|erty and rights might be bartered for bribes. All contracts with &s;overeign &s;tates mu&s;t be made in con|fidence that power and integrity will be united; and he who approaches a &s;overeign people for grants, mu&s;t do it with clean hands. The maxims of honor and hone&s;ty, which form a part of the policy of all enligh|tened &s;overeignties, are a &s;ufficient guarantee to tho&s;e who deal uprightly with governments. Let tho&s;e who maintain a different doctrine, go pro&s;ecute the nation|al a&s;&s;embly of France to make good their a&s;&s;ignats, or the United States for their continental bills.&mdash;Where is the power to try the cau&s;e?&mdash;Or let &s;uch point out the power, which can control the &s;tate of Georgia in the enaction of their laws, or the management of their
<PB N="13" REF="031830_0013_0FEEC7982DC139F0">records. Can the congre&s;s of the United States do it? Certainly no:&mdash;this would de&s;troy the confederation. Can the court of the United States? Clearly they can|not judge what laws ought to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL the arguments of the oppo&s;ers to the re&s;cind|ing act would be more plau&s;ible, if they had in view real e&s;tate in &s;ee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and had hone&s;tly paid a fair con&s;ideration for it.&mdash;In &s;uch a ca&s;e the law might &s;tretch its force to obtain them ju&s;tice; but this be|ing an un&s;ub&s;tantial thing the law cannot reach it, and could not do it, even if the que&s;tion was between two individuals. As in ca&s;e A owns a large farm, divided into 16 lots, and has a right to keep it and u&s;e it as long as he lives, and then to leave it to his heirs for|ever, B, C, D, and &s;o on, to the number of 16; know|ing that competition of buyers rai&s;es the value of &s;arms, and di&s;po&s;ed for their own advantage to deprive A of this benefit, agree among them that B &s;hall alone bid on lot No. 1, C on No. 2, &s;o that A may &s;ell to no other.&mdash;B &s;ells his right of preemption in lot No. 1 to S for 10 dollars&mdash;S &s;ells it to T for 100&mdash;T to U for 1000. Now B declares that he was cheated out of it, &mdash;that he never delivered the deed, &amp;c. and that he holds him&s;elf a bidder for the land as much as ever. A is &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and likely &s;o to continue. Can U &s;u&s;tain an action again&s;t B? All men will agree that B has done U no damage, and U has gained nothing by his money; but U has given his notes to T, and they are put in &s;uit.&mdash;He petitions for relief, &s;tating that T pretended that he owned the &s;ee, and that it was the mo&s;t valuable part of the farm; and that this was his inducement to give 1000 dollars: that there were no records to re&s;ort to, and that he relied &s;olely on T's word. T owns it all&mdash;and that in fact <HI>he did not own the land, but had a right to buy it.</HI> Will a court doubt what equity and good con&s;cience demand in this ca&s;e?&mdash;To apply this, the land in que&s;tion is merely a
<PB N="14" REF="031830_0014_0FEEC799B37B0420">right to buy land, which perhaps may never be for &s;ale; which con&s;ideration alone, &s;eparate from the doctrine of &s;tate &s;overeignty, is an invincible intrench|ment for the &s;tate of Georgia, and the northern pur|cha&s;ers.</P>
<P>SOME &s;ay they may re&s;tore the records. Am I to lie out of my money for an age, waiting to &s;ee whe|ther the &s;overeign &s;tate of Georgia will pity me for having been cheated by tho&s;e who cheated her? But &s;ay others, &s;he may grant it to another company, and then we may try the title. Perhaps ages may pa&s;s be|fore this &s;overeign &s;tate will grant it again, and then neither of us can try the title to the lands, 'till the In|dian title is extingui&s;hed.&mdash;That can't be done, but by liberty to hold a treaty; and this liberty cannot be granted to tho&s;e whom the &s;tate of Georgia denies as her grantees, without violating her &s;overeignty; un|le&s;s by a &s;uit at law the title &s;hould be determined;&mdash; and this title can never be made a law que&s;tion, 'till the fee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the right owners is extin|gui&s;hed. Suppo&s;e a &s;uit brought for the preemption, what mar&s;hall could levy the execution?&mdash;on what could he levy it? Whatever might be the judgment, it would be an idle one, founded on nothing, and no one could carry it into effect.</P>
<P>OTHERS &s;ay we have fairly bought it, <HI>and will have it</HI>&mdash;and under this grant, re&s;cinded and burnt, negoci|ations are now making on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi lands. Vain new editions of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi dreams! Such managers might as well have u&s;ed force without a grant; but when &s;orce is u&s;ed, the reign of law and argument has cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THOSE who have not cheated nor been cheated in this bu&s;ine&s;s, feel di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate; they utter no depre|cations again&s;t Jack&s;on and his party, but calmly view the &s;tate of Georgia, exerci&s;ing a &s;overeign right in a &s;overeign and righteous manner. A great cla&s;s of
<PB N="15" REF="031830_0015_0FEEC79F6AE71FB0">people comfort them&s;elves with a hope of trying the que&s;tion in the federal court, in &s;ome one of the nor|thern &s;tates, whether the re&s;cinding act is valid. As well might you try it before a ju&s;tice's court: the judg|ment of both would be equally powerle&s;s. Can you put at i&s;&s;ue in a di&s;tant &s;tate the &s;overeignty of Geor|gia? Can you obtain judgment that her legi&s;lature has been di&s;tracted; and what will you do with your execution? All the propo&s;itions which have been made to render the re&s;cinding act of no validity are equally unpromi&s;ing, as to the pre&s;ent claimants under the gran|ting act.&mdash;All common-law principles attempted to be applied to the &s;ubject are lo&s;t; and the greate&s;t lawyer is as the weake&s;t pea&s;ant, when attempting to di&s;cu&s;s it. As preemptive claims were never founded on law or right, they are not a &s;ubject of law-books; as they are peculiar to this country, they are not under&s;tood el&s;e|where; and as no ca&s;es &s;uch as that of the re&s;cinding act have ever before occurred, we are not to wonder, that men &s;hould be confounded at the operation of it.</P>
<P>BUT take the nature of their claims, as it is explain|ed&mdash;the rule of equity, which applies to the transfer of them&mdash;the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate&mdash;the re&s;cinding of the act&mdash;the impracticability of trying the legality or equity of it, and it will fairly appear that <HI>the pre&s;ent purcha&s;ers have nothing, and have no pro&s;pect of any thing for their money or their notes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2d. THESE things being true, what is the con&s;e|quence upon the notes, depending on the &s;ales under the granting act? My an&s;wer is, that they ought not to be paid. What &s;orms the courts may think proper to adopt in rendering them void is not material. If it be once a&s;certained that they ought to be void, courts will adopt or invent means proper for the end.</P>
<P>I BEGIN then by taking the three following po&s;i|tions&mdash;1&s;t. <HI>That where a man has been deceived in a contract, and in con&s;equence has deceived another, he &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="031830_0016_0FEEC7A6AED99F30">gain nothing by the transfer: if he e&s;cape without lo&s;s, it is the mo&s;t he can de&s;ire.</HI>&mdash;2d. <HI>If he know of the deceit practi&s;ed on him previous to his &s;elling, and yet made u&s;e of the deceit to induce a bargain, the lea&s;t he can expect is the total lo&s;s of the price agreed on.</HI>&mdash;3d. <HI>If he were a partaker in the original deceit, he ought to lo&s;e the whole and be &s;everely puni&s;hed.</HI> All the &s;ellers of Georgia land have been within the&s;e cla&s;&s;es; for there was de|ceit at the bottom;&mdash;and the many in&s;idious arts prac|ti&s;ed by many of the &s;ellers, give good rea&s;on to believe that they were the <HI>original</HI> deceivers.</P>
<P>THE whole tran&s;action has all the air and appear|ance of a deep-laid and thoroughly executed plan of &s;windling.&mdash;The management of it proves that in the plan &s;ome &s;outhern people were to be gainers, and a great number of the northern people to be lo&s;ers. I venture to predict, that &s;ome &s;outhern people will be bankrupts, and that the northern people will, after much vexation and delay, e&s;cape from lo&s;s. The re&s;|cinding act has &s;truck a deadly blow at the&s;e fir&s;t de|ceivers, and has arre&s;ted their career at the very mo|ment when they were about to be loaded with wealth.</P>
<P>IN this preci&s;e &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, the granting act being re&s;cinded&mdash;the preemption re&s;umed&mdash;no fee of lands in exi&s;tence&mdash;the &s;ellers greedy for payment, crouding for it at the bar of our courts&mdash;ho&s;ts of law|yers in their pay, on great wages&mdash;notes all in &s;uit, and petitions for relief pending:&mdash;What can our courts do? I an&s;wer, they are courts of law and equity, and are in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of doing right between man and man; and this they are to do as far as may be, according to the principles and practice of law and e|quity in the books. I think it has been &s;hewn abun|dantly, that this ca&s;e could not have been contempla|ted in the books;&mdash;it will follow then that this mu&s;t form the ba&s;is of a precedent, and mu&s;t be determined on its own merits.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031830_0017_0FEEC7AB16065DE0">
THE fir&s;t natural enquiry of the courts therefore, is&mdash;the character of the parties and their re&s;pective claims on the ju&s;tice or equity of the law.&mdash;Not their private character; but that which they wear in rela|tion to this new and unprecedented cau&s;e. The plain|tiffs in the&s;e cau&s;es when a&s;ked this que&s;tion may &s;afe|ly an&s;wer&mdash;"We are of tho&s;e, who contrived and col|luded with &s;everal members of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of Georgia, to procure an act, violating their con|&s;titution and alienating the property of the people.&mdash; By promi&s;es of gain, by bribes, we led them to violate their oaths and tho&s;e principles of honor and fidelity to their con&s;tituents, which all laws command them to maintain.&mdash;We &s;ucceeded in our plan&mdash;procured a grant&mdash;we publi&s;hed not &s;ingle pages, but pamphlets of lies&mdash;circulated them with our own hands&mdash;&s;up|ported them by our own affirmations&mdash;&s;wore to them on our honor.&mdash;We thus enli&s;ted men of integrity on our &s;ide&mdash;cau&s;ed them to betray their neighbours&mdash; opened &s;ub&s;criptions for the land&mdash;headed with names of men, who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion had never been obtained.&mdash; We entrapped the unwary&mdash;committed heads of fam|ilies for more than they were worth&mdash;pretended that we were &s;elling under the influence of embarra&s;&s;ment, for le&s;s than half what we might get, had we time to &s;eek purcha&s;ers.&mdash;We ha&s;tened our bargains, le&s;t the re&s;cinding act &s;hould overtake us;&mdash;and to crown all, after we knew the act was pa&s;&s;ed, we employed emi&s;|&s;aries from Philadelphia to ride expre&s;s to complete bargains already projected, and to open contracts at all hazards;&mdash;and when all this was known, we cur&s;|ed Jack&s;on and his party, in the language of fallen Lucifer to Michael.&mdash;We then &s;ecretly employed law|yers to write treati&s;es again&s;t the re&s;cinding act, as their <HI>voluntaries,</HI> upon &s;uch an unprincipled mea&s;ure. &mdash;We circulated the&s;e to convince the dupes of our management, that Jack&s;on was an enemy to fair deal|ing,
<PB N="18" REF="031830_0018_0FEEC7AE1EF56E28">and that the &s;overeign &s;tate of Georgia was a mi&s;|erable &s;ubjected province, who&s;e laws wanted no other confutation than our contempt:&mdash;but when conviction begun to operate on the public mind, and even on our own, that this re&s;cinding act was &s;erious and conclu|&s;ive,&mdash;we employed ho&s;ts of lawyers, with enormous fees, to abet our cau&s;e;&mdash;and by their combined influ|ence, and the aid of law-books, we hope to bear all before us. Tho' we knew that the men whom we had deceived, retained only the mi&s;erable &s;hadows of land, which we pretended to &s;ell them, and were willing to give up their deeds, and to &s;uffer lo&s;s for their delu|&s;ion&mdash;we haughtily refu&s;ed; and to &s;hew our power, loaded them with attachments&mdash;put them to all man|ner of expen&s;e, and are determined that wide-&s;pread ruin and de&s;olation &s;hall follow tho&s;e who have dealt with us,&mdash;for which object we approach the altar of ju&s;tice, and pray the aid of this honorable court to carry our purpo&s;es into effect.&mdash;And if the court doubt this our character, we refer them to the re&s;cinding act, containing 64 depo&s;itions in proof of it&mdash;to our pam|phlets, and to our uniform conduct." To which cha|racter, well may the court &s;ay&mdash;Hail Lucifer, &s;on of the morning!</P>
<P>THE other characters are plainly tho&s;e, who have been the &s;ubjects of all this deceit, impo&s;ture, fal&s;hood and vexation; and who come before the court to ob|tain relief again&s;t a &s;y&s;tem of fraud and &s;windling&mdash; perhaps more complicated in its machinery, and vari|ed in its operations, than any which has di&s;graced the character of man in this or any other age.</P>
<P>I HAVE put language into the mouths of the plain|tiffs, which they would not be apt to u&s;e&mdash;<HI>for 'tis the language of truth,</HI>&mdash;not &s;ancied, but thorougly prove|able; and with all the varni&s;hes and apologies, which this age of rea&s;on, refinement and revolutions, can put upon their conduct, the re&s;ult of a fair inve&s;tigation
<PB N="19" REF="031830_0019_0FEEC7B140F23000">will produce ju&s;t &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.&mdash;To overdraw the character, or di&s;tort the cau&s;e in this &s;tage of it, would be a prejudice to the end which is aimed at. I have therefore pre&s;ented them as they mu&s;t appear, when record, evidence and &s;ub&s;tantial te&s;timony &s;hall be combined in the proof;&mdash;which will infallibly take place before the conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s. Let not tho&s;e judge chimerical, this mode of introducing cha|racters, who have ob&s;erved in courts of chancery ev|ery thing brought &s;orward, which forms the charac|ters of the parties, in direct relation to the cau&s;e in que&s;tion.&mdash;This is always admitted, and no more is contended.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd que&s;tion to the plaintiffs, is&mdash;"What claim have you upon the ju&s;tice or equity of this court?"&mdash;The an&s;wer mu&s;t be&mdash;"We have notes for our Georgia deeds, and we pray the power of the court to enforce the collection of them." The que&s;|tion to the defendants, is&mdash;"Did you &s;ign and deliver tho&s;e notes?&mdash;are they your act and deed?"&mdash;The an&s;wer is&mdash;"We did &s;ign and deliver the notes; but they are not our act and deed?" At this in&s;tant books, authorities, precedents all croud in favor of the plain|tiffs: and a court po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of full power to make a precedent of right, is to be &s;tormed out of all delibe|ration. But is every note, &s;igned and delivered un|conditionally, the act and deed of the &s;igner?&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e he is unable to read, and the note is read to him as for &pound;.100, and it really is for &pound;.1000, and can be &s;o proved, and that the obligee read it to him wrong,&mdash; is that his act and deed?&mdash;Again, &s;uppo&s;e that he reads a note him&s;elf, and by &s;huffling of the obligee, another is placed for him to &s;ign, and he deliver the la&s;t,&mdash;is that his act and deed?&mdash;Or if he &s;igned and delivered it with a pi&s;tol at his brea&s;t:&mdash;Are &s;uch notes the act and deed of tho&s;e who deliver them?&mdash;Every one will agree no. Then there are ca&s;es where a note may be
<PB N="20" REF="031830_0020_0FEEC7B5DBEFDEE8">&s;igned and delivered unconditionally, and yet not be the act and deed of the &s;igners.&mdash;Pray is there any difference between &s;light of hand and &s;light of head? Or &s;hall he who reads a note wrong, and he who tells 100 lies to obtain it, &s;tand on a different footing?&mdash; Rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e &s;ay no. The books may be very nice about the mode in which the injured &s;ign|er &s;hall get rid of the payment; but they will never &s;upport a malefactor in recovering notes under the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>COURTS will not decide again&s;t notes upon mere &s;ug|ge&s;ton of fraud: It mu&s;t be made evident. In the&s;e ca&s;es, various are the kinds and degrees of evidence; but when once it can be &s;hewn, that the plaintiff is one of the horde, or allied to tho&s;e men who overrun the&s;e northern &s;tates with their Georgia &s;crip or deeds, and that the con&s;ideration of the notes has wholly fail|ed&mdash;the pre&s;umption becomes violent, that the&s;e frauds have attended the &s;ales; and that &s;mall portion of light and evidence, which almo&s;t every individual purcha&s;er can produce, will be &s;ufficient to bring every ca&s;e with|in the general principles and deci&s;ions, which mu&s;t ob|tain in all the Georgia cau&s;es.</P>
<P>OUR courts and juries, if driven to peremptory law deci&s;ions, will decide that the&s;e notes are not the act and deed of the makers and deliverers of them. San|guine Georgia &s;peculators, who feel not the indignati|on and contempt which follows their enveloped frauds, may, under the pupilage of their lawyers, be taught to hope better things:&mdash;But let them remember, that great cau&s;es draw forth the energy of man; and that on cau&s;es of &s;uch magnitude, courts will do right. Ha&s;te, negligence, confinement to nice con&s;tructions, &s;ometimes thwart the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, in &s;mall di&s;|putes; <HI>but here no recovery can eventually be had, un|le&s;s it &s;hall appear eventually right, that men &s;hall gain wealth by their own wrong.</HI> I have here taken the
<PB N="21" REF="031830_0021_0FEEC7B8CF2A6E58">wor&s;t i&s;&s;ue which the cau&s;es can po&s;&s;ibly be brought to; and if courts and juries will not, under the old e&s;tabli&s;hment, determine again&s;t the notes, yet when the &s;ellers knew they had no right in fee, and when it appears by the event, that by rea&s;on of their own fraud they had no right at all,&mdash;courts and juries will deter|mine again&s;t the notes, whatever innovation it may produce. Probably a deci&s;ion that the&s;e notes are not the act and deed of the makers of them, upon the ground that they were obtained by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t deceit of the obligee, would form a new precedent: but be|ing ba&s;ed on right, it could never prejudice right in any future deci&s;ions. The danger of new precedents is, that the perver&s;ene&s;s or ignorance of man may ap|ply them where they ought not to be applied; but this danger, however great and often inculcated, has never intimidated the independent judges in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall from doing right, and making precedents where ju&s;tice required them.</P>
<P>THESE remarks may apply to negotiable notes&mdash;to Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;cript&mdash;to quit-claim deeds&mdash;and to all the variety of ca&s;es under the&s;e Georgia contracts.&mdash;For if my premi&s;es are right re&s;pecting the original fraud, and the total lo&s;s of the lands, or the preemptive right in the purcha&s;ers,&mdash;the conclu&s;ion will extend to ev|ery note and contract, i&s;&s;uing from &s;uch a corrupt ori|ginal.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e in re&s;pect to the northern purcha&s;ers, is preci&s;ely as if the fir&s;t grantees had forged the grant: For, a grant voidable becau&s;e of fraud and corruption, is no better nor wor&s;e, than a forged one;&mdash;and the original actors in this fraud, and all their abettors, confederates and acce&s;&s;ories, are every way as <HI>ba&s;ely guilty</HI> as if they had forged the act.&mdash;The guilt as re&s;|pects the &s;tate of Georgia is the &s;ame; and the impo|&s;ition on the purcha&s;ers is certainly as great and per|nicious. I call mo&s;t of tho&s;e their confederates who
<PB N="22" REF="031830_0022_0FEEC7BACA1A2A98">came from the mid&s;t of them, with their pamphlets and mi&s;repre&s;entations:&mdash;and even they, who were them&s;elves deceived, and who deceived their neigh|bours, and are now pre&s;&s;ing for great profits to them|&s;elves, de&s;erve an high rank in this brigade of impo&s;|tors. I &s;hould not a&s;&s;ert thus po&s;itively on this &s;ubject, were I unable to bottom my&s;elf on the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;&s;tan|tial proofs;&mdash;and no individuals can be wounded by &s;uch obloquies, but tho&s;e who&s;e known conduct has fully ju&s;tified them.</P>
<P>THESE remarks were not de&s;igned to <HI>add</HI> any odi|um to the fraudulent &s;ellers of Georgia land; but to lead the minds of the purcha&s;ers, who have given their notes, to reflect <HI>on the whole Georgia bu&s;ine&s;s as a &s;ys|tem of impo&s;ture and &s;windling&mdash;on the re&s;cinding act as valid and conclu&s;ive&mdash;and on the power and di&s;po&s;ition of our courts to do ample ju&s;tice on the &s;ubject.</HI> If the hints &s;ugge&s;ted will lead to a new train of inve&s;tigation, they will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they were written.</P>
<P>NOTE.&mdash;The compa&s;s which I have taken would not admit refer|ences to documents: and the pre&s;ent &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s ren|dered it improper to di&s;cu&s;s very minutely how the notes may be avoided:&mdash;But tho&s;e who hold deeds of Georgia land ought to be thoroughly convinced, that all the lands now claimed un|der the u&s;urped act, are not worth one cent; and a pretence that the re&s;cinding act is void, is a mi&s;erable delu&s;ion.</P>

The di&s;tinction mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained, that a dependant power has a pow|er above them, to compel them to make good their grants and contracts; and that <HI>an independent power can make, or unmake grants at will; becau&s;e no power can decide on the morality, equity, or policy of their mea|&s;ures.</HI> If the granting act had been con&s;titutional, fair and honorable, and the re&s;cinding act ever &s;o unfair and immoral,&mdash;yet the con&s;equence to the purcha&s;ers would be equally fatal. The power which has depri|ved them of the lands, is beyond their control; and all the advocates in favour of the &s;ellers, never have and never can &s;ugge&s;t one practicable mode of even beginning to attack the validity of the re&s;cinding act. &mdash;That of deciding again&s;t it in the&s;e northern &s;tates, has been already &s;hewn to be futile. Some have been di&s;po&s;ed to maintain, that if the fir&s;t act could be void at all, it mu&s;t have been &s;o in its own nature; and therefore the re&s;cinding act, notwith&s;tanding the fir&s;t,
<PB N="26" REF="031830_0026_0FEEC7CFB502F7F8">&s;tands to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed on its own merits:&mdash;But this is only a re-production of the fir&s;t delu&s;ion;&mdash;for the granting act does not &s;tand at all: it is burnt, and that power alone, which could declare definitively on the validity of it, has put it beyond the reach of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. The power it&s;elf is fir&s;t to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and if you can once di&s;cu&s;s that out of exi&s;tence, you well know that the granting act will be good enough.&mdash; You have the parchments, 'tis true, large as dining|tables, certified by the &s;ecretary.&mdash;Vain &s;hadows of a grant!&mdash;Dare you produce them in the &s;tate of Geor|gia, to &s;upport the title which you pretended to &s;ell us? Of little worth are they, if they cannot be produced on a trial, where if we obtain judgment, the execution will inve&s;t us with the title which you &s;old us. A condition of wrong without redre&s;s, or of right with|out power, is very unde&s;irable to a landholder. Your own wrongs, your own frauds and violations of mo|rality, have led up this act, again&s;t which you &s;o ve|hemently cry&mdash;&s;hame, wickedne&s;s, immorality!&mdash;Go cry them in the &s;treets of Georgia, plead them in their courts, ring them in the ears of their legi&s;lators,&mdash;there alone will they an&s;wer our purpo&s;e. If this is all a fair tran&s;action, as you declared to us by words and pamphlets, make it appear &s;o to the world, and let us have the benefit of your exertions.&mdash;While it appears unfair and wicked, we &s;hall withhold from you pay|ment&mdash;courts will &s;u&s;tain us in withholding it:&mdash;and the certain event of the breaking of the bubble, will be your own bankruptcy, which is even now at the doors. I have not re&s;ted entirely on the ground of power, thro' any idea that the granting act would be valid on its own merits. If any man judges that it was valid, and that the &s;ellers have conducted with a due portion of integrity, let him a&s;&s;ert it; and I am willing to take the burden of proving the act bad, and unfairly ob|tained,&mdash;and the conduct of a number of the &s;ellers
<PB N="27" REF="031830_0027_0FEEC7D14003B538">to have been thoroughly abandoned.&mdash;In this number I include all tho&s;e who were them&s;elves deceived, and who in con&s;equence deceived their neighbours, and who are demanding any profits in the trade. This fact of demanding <HI>profits</HI> in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, accom|panied by a few acknowledged principles and deduc|tions, will fix the character of &s;uch beyond a vindica|tion.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus an&s;wered the two fir&s;t delu&s;ions, and pray you to reflect, that the grant is really rever&s;ed and revoked, and that you can never try your title to any purpo&s;e&mdash;that you have lo&s;t all &s;hadows of the land&mdash;and that if you have any defence to make, any money to &s;ave, any notes to avoid, or any redre&s;s to obtain,&mdash;now is your time; and the time to avail your|&s;elves will be &s;hort.</P>
<P>NEXT, as to the &s;imilitude between the&s;e &s;ales, and tho&s;e of lottery tickets, &s;o often introduced, it may be ju&s;t as re&s;pects a number of the Georgia bargains, &s;o far as it can apply; but if a man propo&s;es to me to purcha&s;e of him a 100 tickets in the Savannah fire lot|tery, and &s;hews me a &s;cheme of the lottery, and a&s;&s;ures me that it will be drawn in 60 days, and I buy them, and give him my note for the payment&mdash;and it after|wards appears that there was neither lottery, managers, nor any &s;cheme publi&s;hed, or that there was a lottery without a prize, or one which could never be drawn,&mdash; am I to pay my note?&mdash;Certainly not&mdash;e&s;pecially not, if I can prove that this &s;ame man contrived with &s;eve|ral others, to make out a &s;cheme of a lottery, which could not in its nature an&s;wer any other purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of impo&s;ture. But this compari&s;on with lottery tickets is not ju&s;t: for in lottery tickets, every man buys with known hazard of lo&s;s or gain. In the&s;e bargains every man bought with the greate&s;t certainty of gain, provided the pamphlets and declarations which he bought with his deeds, proved true.&mdash;He could not
<PB N="28" REF="031830_0028_0FEEC7D5823D4DA0">calculate upon lo&s;s, except from tho&s;e circum&s;tances of treachery and fraud on the part of the &s;ellers, which would wholly vacate the contract.</P>
<P>BUT 4th. Tho&s;e who have given notes, are to be frightened by the books!!&mdash;Unfortunately for the &s;el|lers, the books give no comfort, no &s;upport. Courts have been trammelled by books at the opening of this bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Judge Cha&s;e was trammelled with books in the opening of the famous Connecticut &s;tate cau&s;e; but after four days dige&s;tion, his mind was relieved, and he declared that the books did not apply, and that there was <HI>no &s;uch thing as &s;u&s;taining an analogy between protections granted by a &s;overeign independent &s;tate, and tho&s;e granted by the dependant courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI> By citing books and authorities, and covering the green cloth with folios, the advocates may per&s;uade their Georgia clients, that much good may come out of evil; but on thorough canva&s;&s;ing, it will be found, that (&s;trange to tell) the books can afford no light on a &s;ubject of which the compilers had no conception.</P>
<P N="5">5th. LET purcha&s;ers be guarded again&s;t being amu|&s;ed by the pro&s;pect of <HI>our</HI> courts deciding again&s;t the re&s;cinding act.&mdash;If all the courts in the United States &s;hould decide again&s;t it, and all the mar&s;halls and de|puty-mar&s;halls, &s;heriffs and deputy-&s;heriffs, &s;hould be employed to carry their judgments into effect,&mdash;the whole would &s;till be a mi&s;erable farce and delu&s;ion; &mdash;for they would not in the lea&s;t prejudice the re&s;cind|ing act, nor benefit our title, and the &s;tate of Georgia would care nothing about them.</P>
<P N="6">6th. As to the re&s;cinding act being made in the tu|mult of the people, and that there is good chance of its being repealed&mdash;there is not one word of truth, nor &s;ymptom of probability about it:&mdash;and this pretence is a mere continuation of the fal&s;e and &s;windling mea|&s;ures, which have been practi&s;ed on you.</P>
<P N="7">AND 7th. As to the hypothetical rea&s;oning, that if
<PB N="29" REF="031830_0029_0FEEC7D85C945860">Georgia could re&s;cind this act, then Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts can re&s;cind theirs&mdash;it ought to be other|wi&s;e &s;tated, viz.&mdash;That Georgia has re&s;cinded her gran|ting act, and if Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;hould re&s;cind theirs, they would do as Georgia has done;&mdash; and what would the claimants do in any &s;uch ca&s;e, where the Indian title is not extingui&s;hed? In a &s;itua|tion wholly remedile&s;s, as to title or preemption, are you who have thought your&s;elves purcha&s;ers of Geor|gia lands; and your &s;ituation is brought on you by your confidence in tho&s;e, who &s;old to you;&mdash;and this &s;ituation is aggravated by the per&s;ecutions and law per|plexities, with which the&s;e deceivers are hunting you. Your time is devoted, and your property &s;ubjected to the apparent rapacity of the Georgia &s;ellers; but they in reality, are now only the puppets of the farce&mdash; there is not one chance in a thou&s;and of their event|ually gaining any thing; but &s;till the farce mu&s;t be carried on, for the emolument of the craftsmen. Of great importance is it in this &s;ituation, that you po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elves of facts&mdash;that you give way to no delu&s;ions &mdash;and that you compo&s;e your&s;elves under the&s;e com|plicated abu&s;es. If you get rid of your notes, yet the land deeded to you is not worth a thou&s;andth part of what you have paid&mdash;be that &s;um ever &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>As many of the ideas, which have been introduced on this &s;ubject, tending to &s;hew that the common law principles and practice cannot be applied to the&s;e ca&s;es, may appear inadmi&s;&s;ible,&mdash;I beg leave to enforce them by reference to the rea&s;onings and practice adopted in the South &s;ea &s;cheme, in the year 1721.

<Q><P>WHEN the bubble bur&s;t, and the &s;tock the &s;ub|&s;cribers had purcha&s;ed at 1000 per cent. fell to 150, and of cour&s;e the lo&s;s of every &s;uch &s;ub&s;criber was &pound;.850 out of every &pound;.1000 &s;ub&s;cribed&mdash;I &s;ay, when
<PB N="30" REF="031830_0030_0FEEC7D9E4232110">this happened, legal &s;uits (of which very many were commenced) for the&s;e debts, due to the company, would have reduced mo&s;t of the monied men in the kingdom, to a &s;tate of remedile&s;s bankruptcy, and the company mu&s;t have lo&s;t mo&s;t of their money in the bargain. The public creditors had lo&s;t mo&s;t of their public &s;ecurities, which they had &s;ub&s;cribed into that fund,&mdash;and infinite other mi&s;chiefs of a like nature mu&s;t have accrued of a kind mo&s;t ruinous and wrong, and of an amount &s;o great as to affect national intere&s;t, honor and credit, and of &s;uch an extreme and extraordinary nature, that no ordinary rules of law could be applied in any &s;uch manner as to afford the lea&s;t remedy; but would rather in|crea&s;e the evil, and give the wrong a kind of &s;anc|tion of the law.</P>
<P>IN this extreme ca&s;e, the parliament found them|&s;elves under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;uming the power of &s;overeign equity, and as &s;upreme chancel|lors of the kingdom to &s;uper&s;ede the ordinary rules of the law, control its force, &s;often its rigor, and a|dopt &s;uch equitable principles as would afford &s;ome remedy of an evil, an injury, a wrong of &s;uch mag|nitude as brought the ju&s;tice, credit and &s;afety of the nation into danger. On this principle, they &s;u&s;|pended law-&s;uits, annulled &s;pecial bails, di&s;charged numberle&s;s debtors who owed for &s;tock, on paying 10 per cent. of their debts, compelled compen&s;a|tions in favor of the &s;ufferers, forced dividends and appropriations of the &s;tock of the company, and e|ven puni&s;hed many for mi&s;management, who &s;eem|ed to have conformed them&s;elves to the letter of the law, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></Q>
<P>VERY &s;trong remon&s;trances were made again&s;t the interference of the legi&s;lature, and that the matter &s;hould be left to the cour&s;e of law, i. e. to be decided according to the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments of all
<PB N="31" REF="031830_0031_0FEEC7DB74392018">negotiable notes, bonds, &amp;c.&mdash;but on a clo&s;e in&s;pec|tion of the matter, it was &s;oon clearly &s;een, that the variation of the exchange of the&s;e &s;tocks (or their de|preciation, as we call it) was &s;o enormous and extreme, that any application of the ordinary rules of law and practice, to them, would produce the mo&s;t ruinous in|ju&s;tice and wrongs,&mdash;and of cour&s;e, every idea of that mode of &s;ettlement and adju&s;tment was in&s;tantly given up. Their great principle was, that ju&s;tice and right was the grand end of law, and paramount to any par|ticular rules, or e&s;tabli&s;hed practice,&mdash;and of cour&s;e, ought to control them in all ca&s;es of &s;o extreme and ex|traordinary a kind, as could not fall within the rea&s;on on which the&s;e rules were founded; but &s;o circum|&s;tanced as that an application of the&s;e common rules, would unavoidably produce &s;uch injury and wrong, as was totally de&s;tructive of all that right, which was the e&s;&s;ential principle and end of all laws.</P>
<P>AS a further explanation of the interference of par|liament, it was &s;aid that collections according to the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments, "would bring remedile&s;s ruin on thou&s;ands of individuals, and at the &s;ame time heap immen&s;e fortunes on others, who had never de|&s;erved them."</P>
<P>VERY &s;imilar to this, in operation and management, was the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi bubble, in France, two years before. In both the&s;e important and memorable proceedents, of two of the mo&s;t enlightened nations in the world, were recognized &s;pecifically the following principles&mdash;"That the ordinary rules of law would do infinite mi&s;chief and inju&s;tice, were not the rigor of them to be &s;oft|ened and corrected by chancery&mdash;that the powers of chancery ought always to control the common law, whenever in any ca&s;e the application of the ordinary rules of law, will manife&s;tly de&s;troy right and ju&s;tice, or work a wrong&mdash;that law is certainly perverted, and needs correction, whenever it de&s;troys right or does
<PB N="32" REF="031830_0032_0FEEC7DFE2E7DA20">wrong." That the &s;upreme power of every &s;tate, is the &s;upreme chancery of it, and mu&s;t have &s;overeign authority to repeal, to limit or control every rule of law, and may and ought to do it, whenever that rule operates by way of de&s;truction or defalcation of right, or producing of wrong,&mdash;and that ju&s;tice and &s;ecurity of right can never be perfect or even tolerable in any &s;tate, without the exi&s;tence of this power and the pru|dent exerci&s;e of it.

<P>THESE are vital i&s;&s;ues from the &s;ource of law, calcu|lated to do good, wherever they flow:&mdash;the&s;e are prin|ciples, which put to flight all tecknical di&s;tinctions, and furni&s;h us with a truth highly important in the&s;e cau&s;|es, viz.&mdash;that there are extraordinary ca&s;es, where com|mon law principles cannot and ought not to be appli|ed, by rea&s;on of the manife&s;t inju&s;tice, which would re&s;ult from an application of them.</P>
<P>THESE Georgia cau&s;es furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance &s;ince 1721, for the application of the&s;e principlies.&mdash; They do not preci&s;ely re&s;emble either of the other bub|bles: for in the South &s;ea &s;cheme, the amazing ri&s;e of the &s;tock, originated in their contract with parliament, for taking in the national debt. Their &s;tate of pro&s;|perity was overrated, and the funds ro&s;e by mere en|thu&s;ia&s;m, from 130 to 330 per cent.&mdash;and from the month of April to Augu&s;t, they ro&s;e from the la&s;t &s;um to 1000 per cent; but it was a reality they were deal|ing in:&mdash;and even after the bubble broke and parlia|ment interfered, the &s;tock was really worth 150 per cent. It will be well &s;een, that the Georgia bubble does not preci&s;ely re&s;emble that of the South &s;ea;&mdash; for here was no reality at bottom, and here was great fraud in the means, as I con&s;tantly hold my&s;elf re&s;|pon&s;ible to &s;hew, whenever it &s;hall be doubted.&mdash;But in one very important re&s;pect, there is a re&s;emblance.
<PB N="33" REF="031830_0033_0FEEC7E169A82B58">The legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of Georgia, like the &s;ove|reign legi&s;latures of England and France, &s;eeing the wrong and oppre&s;&s;ion, which would be cau&s;ed by the collection of the notes, and combining this with the other inducements before &s;tated&mdash;have, as they had a &s;overeign right to do, de&s;troyed the whole con&s;idera|tion of the notes, and have thus let them and the hol|ders of them to the ground. The &s;overeign legi&s;la|ture of the union, might have &s;u&s;pended the power of their own courts, from any cognizance of the cau&s;es: &s;o the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates might have &s;u&s;|pended the power of their courts; but this would have been only a partial remedy of the evil. The &s;tate of Georgia, who&s;e acts and laws are to be re&s;pected thro'|out the union, has in a mo&s;t pointed and peremptory manner declared, that there is no con&s;ideration for the&s;e notes,&mdash;and has &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity and propri|ety of this declaration more conclu&s;ively, than they were &s;hewn by either of tho&s;e parliaments. Their exerci&s;e of &s;overeignty is not novel, and the rea&s;ons on which it is founded are as old as the world.&mdash; <HI>This public act of the &s;tate of Georgia, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t conclu&s;ive te&s;timony of a want of con&s;ideration, which can be improved in a court of chancery: and tho&s;e courts could never have granted relief again&s;t notes for want of con|&s;ideration, on more ample grounds.</HI></P>
<P>IN a very important re&s;pect al&s;o, the Georgia plain|tiffs &s;tand in the &s;ame rank with tho&s;e, who in the South &s;ea bu&s;ine&s;s were pro&s;ecuting for 850/1000 of what co&s;t them nothing, and was good for nothing:&mdash;the remaining 150/1000 and the price actually paid for the lands by the Georgia companies, placing them both on an equal footing,&mdash;both having a law of a &s;overeign &s;tate, barring them from an oppre&s;&s;ive recovery&mdash;and both equally de&s;erving to feel the inconvenience re&s;ult|ing to oppre&s;&s;ors from the operation of principles of equity.&mdash;Neither can be in the rank of tho&s;e, who
<PB N="34" REF="031830_0034_0FEEC7E5D5897D20">hold notes for money lent, or labour done; but both are in the rank of tho&s;e, who are hunting for money, on principles de&s;tructive to the de&s;ign of courts, and the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. It is fortunate for the public, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a concurrence of public acts of &s;overeign legi&s;latures, on &s;ubjects &s;o &s;imilar&mdash;and that the parties pre&s;&s;ing for payment at the bar of our courts, &s;hould meet an ob&s;tacle &s;o equally and ju&s;tly fatal to their unfounded claims: for the deci&s;ions in the&s;e ca&s;es again&s;t the notes, will give to our courts occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert principles de&s;tructive to the fraudu|lent arts, which have expo&s;ed many of our citizens to &s;evere lo&s;s of property.</P>
<P>HAPPILY our courts are not de&s;titute of chancery powers, &s;ufficient to carry the equitable objects of the re&s;cinding act into full effect: and when the doctrines of chancery are introduced&mdash;when the original prin|ciples of right are contemplated&mdash;when this bubble is compared with other bubbles&mdash;when the parties and the cau&s;es are known, and the re&s;cinding act is duly plead,&mdash;if courts can he&s;itate about pronouncing a|gain&s;t the notes, it will be only that one fiat of the na|tional legi&s;lature, may put a perpetual end to the con|vul&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;s cau&s;ed by the Georgia, Virginia, Su&s;quehannah, Canada, and all other ba&s;ele&s;s &s;pecu|lations.</P>
<P>IT will be well &s;een, that I have not left the&s;e notes to depend on the contingence of &s;uch a national mea|&s;ure. The defence of tho&s;e, who are &s;ued on their notes, &s;tands mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantially on the chancery pow|ers ve&s;ted in our courts:&mdash;and the means of calling tho&s;e powers into effectual exerci&s;e, have been ju&s;t &s;hewn to be abundant.</P>
<P>BUT merely to get rid of the payment of the notes is not the &s;ole object.&mdash;Large &s;ums of money have been paid, which in equity and good con&s;cience ought to be refunded.&mdash;In addition to the&s;e, great damages
<PB N="35" REF="031830_0035_0FEEC7F2DD2BD5A0">have been &s;u&s;tained, by rea&s;on of the fal&s;hood and &s;windling practi&s;ed in the&s;e &s;ales. The lands or deeds in the hands of the purcha&s;ers, are not worth a far|thing,&mdash;and would be worth the meere&s;t trifle, if the re&s;cinding act &s;hould now be burnt, and the granting act re&s;tored:&mdash;for the granting act re&s;tored would not inve&s;t you with the fee of the lands, &s;ubject to the right of hunting and fi&s;hing, &amp;c.&mdash;which fee you thought your&s;elves to have bought: and the violent parties, which have been created in the confu&s;ion of this bu|&s;ine&s;s, would probably prevent your ever obtaining a right to extingui&s;h the Indian title.&mdash;Indeed the com|motions about the Georgia lands, have led up a &s;erious claim of congre&s;s,&mdash;which otherwi&s;e would have been as dormant as their claim to the Chene&s;&s;ee country.&mdash; This claim, however originated, will not be ea&s;ily re|linqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>BUT if all ob&s;tacles were removed, your right to hold a treaty, is merely a right to buy the land at the full value of it,&mdash;and this you are to do under the eye of &s;worn commi&s;&s;ioners and interpreters. This treaty is to be opened with great expen&s;e: and your agents are to meet not a few ignorant &s;traggling Indians, but the powerful, opulent and enlightened nations of the Creeks, Chactaws and Chicka&s;aws&mdash;headed by chiefs of great fame, information and influence.&mdash;The object of this treaty is, to buy from them the place of their birth, their conque&s;ts and their re&s;idence:&mdash;and you come to them under the fa&s;cinating character of men, repre&s;enting a horde of impo&s;tors, who cheated the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tate of Georgia, out of their u|&s;urped and impo&s;ing right of alone bidding on the&s;e lands: and you apply to them, after blood has been repeatedly and un&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;hed, to force them to retreat.&mdash;You apply to them for their lands&mdash;not as a place of refuge from per&s;ecution&mdash;not as a &s;oil, where you wi&s;h to labour, and to introduce agriculture, and
<PB N="36" REF="031830_0036_0FEEC7F5E0B978D0">the arts of civilized life&mdash;not as a place, where you wi&s;h to embrace and treat them as a band of brothers;&mdash; but as a frontier, where you may erect forts, e&s;tabli&s;h garri&s;ons, &s;tretch the &s;trong arm of the union, and fill, with their ancient and implacable opre&s;&s;ors and ene|mies.&mdash;With a council &s;uch as the&s;e nations will pre|&s;ent to you,&mdash;rum, whi&s;ky and ru&s;ty nails, will not be con&s;idered as conclu&s;ive arguments:&mdash;truth, &s;incerity and a &s;ufficiency of property to enable them to remove where they may do better, will alone go down. Will you tell them, that you have already paid large &s;ums of money, to prevent others from bidding on their lands&mdash;and that therefore you cannot give the full va|lue of them?&mdash;Will you de&s;ire the commi&s;&s;ioners to inform them, that you expect to make immen&s;e for|tunes out of their lands, and that there is no way of your doing it, but by purcha&s;ing them for far le&s;s than they are worth?&mdash;Shall your interpreters expound to them the whole hi&s;tory of this bu&s;ine&s;s?&mdash;Or will you &s;moke with them the calumet of peace, exchange your baubles for theirs, and call them friends and brothers? Will you tell them, that you came from a land flow|ing with milk and honey, abounding in corn and green pa&s;tures, and overflowing in all the conveniences and luxuries of life&mdash;from a land, where every indu&s;trious man may gain wealth&mdash;and that for their &s;akes you are come up thither? They know better than all this,&mdash; they have lately told us, at lake Erie, that they know the arts of the white men:&mdash;and the Georgia commi&s;|&s;ioners, but la&s;t year, with as much parade as could attend a treaty, and as plau&s;ible talks as you can hold with them, got for an&s;wer, that they would not &s;ell.&mdash; And &s;uppo&s;e you get the &s;ame an&s;wer, after all your expen&s;es, what is your preemption worth?&mdash;Or &s;up|po&s;e they &s;hould offer the lands to you, at &s;uch price as you have repeatedly declared them worth, if free from incumbrance, what would your preemption be
<PB N="37" REF="031830_0037_0FEEC7F768842970">worth? As re&s;pects the Indians, the lands are theirs in fee, with all the u&s;es belonging to them;&mdash;and they care not for preemptive rights&mdash;they can di&s;encumber them at plea&s;ure&mdash;and they feel and know them&s;elves entitled to as much in value, as the lands are worth to any purcha&s;er,&mdash;and there is no propriety in their giv|ing you 9-10ths of the whole land for &s;eiling the re|mainder:&mdash;and yet a le&s;s commi&s;&s;ion for doing this bu&s;ine&s;s, is hardly contemplated. Perhaps fraud or force may deprive the&s;e nations of their lands, within a few years; but I have no idea, that within a centu|ry they will voluntarily &s;ell them:&mdash;for they are not a mi&s;erable handful, as the Georgia &s;ellers repre&s;ented, con&s;tantly decrea&s;ing in numbers, and rather inclining to retreat than to maintain their ground; but ju&s;t the contrary.</P>
<P>SHALL it be &s;aid, that the purcha&s;ers knew or ought to have known all the&s;e things?&mdash;The be&s;t an&s;wer will be, that they did not know them, and had not the means of knowing them, and the whole repre&s;entation was as I have before &s;tated&mdash;that there was only an u&s;ufruct between the purcha&s;ers and a complete po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands,&mdash;which u&s;ufruct might be ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, as there were immen&s;e tracts farther to the we&s;tward and northward, where the Indians would find better hunting and fi&s;hing than on the&s;e lands.&mdash; The commotions re&s;pecting the &s;ales have been &s;uch, that a re&s;toration of the granting act, if &s;uch an event could be conceived, would be very far from re&s;toring to the pre&s;ent claimants, what they &s;uppo&s;ed they had purcha&s;ed:&mdash;&s;o far from it, that the incumbrances then exi&s;ting upon the claim, would in all probability be in|&s;urmountable. I have not even taken into my calcu|lation, the influence which the &s;tate of Georgia, or a|ny party among them, might u&s;e again&s;t you in ca&s;e of a treaty,&mdash;nor the probable exi&s;tence of a great in|terference of titles, by fraudulent and multiplied deeds,
<PB N="38" REF="031830_0038_0FEEC7F8EF499B28">re&s;ting merely on detached paper or parchment, with|out any record to &s;upport them or di&s;cover their fal|lacy;&mdash;but we have a fair right to believe, that men who will take unprincipled means to get rich, will not be le&s;s abandoned in the means of extrication, when the gulph of bankruptcy is before them.</P>
<P>IN VIEW of the premi&s;es, I fully believe, that a re&s;|toration of the granting act, would not only wrong the people of Georgia,&mdash;but would prove a &s;erious e|vil to the pre&s;ent claimants, and a dreadful misfortune to all who might be after purcha&s;ers.&mdash;It would open a new &s;cene of delu&s;ive hopes to the world, and fur|ni&s;h new daggers to aim at the vitals of morality, fair dealing and confidence between man and man. Long enough have friends &s;tabbed friends, neighbours be|trayed neighbours&mdash;and the wealth of centuries been wa&s;ted by the delu&s;ions of a moment.&mdash;Truth, hone&s;|ty and commercial credit have &s;uffered wounds deep enough: and all the friends of &s;ociety feel grateful to the legi&s;lature, which arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s the de&s;|tructive pe&s;tilence. Formerly the enemies of man fre|quented the public roads&mdash;put pi&s;tols to the brea&s;ts of un&s;u&s;pecting travellers, and robbed them of the valu|ables they had about them; but the &s;ufferers could re|turn to their hou&s;es and lands, and by indu&s;try repair the lo&s;s.&mdash;We live to &s;ee robbery in a more refined &s;tile. Men who never added an iota to the wealth or morals of the world, and who&s;e &s;ingle moment was never devoted to making one being wi&s;er or happier throughout the univer&s;e&mdash;riding in their chariots&mdash; plotting the ruin of born and unborn millions&mdash;aim|ing with feathers to cut throats, and on parchments to &s;eal de&s;truction,&mdash;the&s;e are the robbers of modern days.&mdash;They bring de&s;olation among our farmers&mdash; they &s;pread di&s;tre&s;s in towns&mdash;they &s;corn the paltry plunder of pocket-books, and watches&mdash;they aim at hou&s;es and lands&mdash;&s;trike at the foundation of many
<PB N="39" REF="031830_0039_0FEEC7FA73D97000">generations,&mdash;and would de&s;troy families, root and branch. Long enough have fraud, fal&s;hood and &s;win|dling &s;talked our &s;treets:&mdash;often enough have our far|mers left their fields and wrecked the indu&s;try of pain|ful and hone&s;t years upon the mountains of Virginia: &mdash;often enough have our jails and dockets witne&s;&s;ed the ruined hopes of the dupes of Newtown and Stock|bridge &s;peculations.&mdash;The&s;e la&s;t are not imputable to the Georgia &s;ellers,&mdash;unle&s;s by their &s;uperior addre&s;s, and the wider ruin they have cau&s;ed, they may claim the honor of ingurgitating the&s;e le&s;&s;er robberies.</P>
<P>I AM not di&s;torting this &s;ubject; but am drawing likene&s;&s;es of which the originals exi&s;t. The indigna|tion of an incen&s;ed public, is fa&s;t gathering over you who have &s;at for this picture.&mdash;The advocates of your impo&s;tures, begin to di&s;cover, that they have been led to abet mea&s;ures which they abhor. The means of paying fees are nearly exhau&s;ted&mdash;the funds to whch you look for help, will prove as deceitful as the eyes of tho&s;e, whom you have injured, will be dreadful to you, after your ruin &s;hall be complete. Your char|acters, your hopes of wealth, your all, are tumbling into the pit, which you have digged for others:&mdash;and if the day of your total poverty, contempt and de&s;pair, can be ha&s;tened by what is here written, I &s;hall have paid to you, who de&s;erve this character, the only debt, which in equity and good con&s;cience I owe you.</P>
