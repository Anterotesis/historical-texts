<P>IF the Publication of the following Letter needs any Apo|logy at all, I think it needs but a very &s;hort one.

<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. BACKUS, Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TRUST I may &s;ay truly, without nau&s;eous &s;awning, or criminal flattery, by a little acquaintance with your per&s;on, and more with your writings, that I look upon it that you are favoured with &s;ome excellent endowments of mind, with a good and rare ra&s;ent, e&s;|pecially in writing; and that for the mo&s;t part your pen has been employed in the cau&s;e of truth&mdash;Yet however, I ob&s;erve &s;ome things in your writings which brings an ancient but true ob&s;ervation to my mind, viz. <HI>That the be&s;t of men, are but men at the be&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Therefore, &s;ir, take it not ill if I point you to one or two of tho&s;e &s;pots with my pen, &s;ince I can a&s;&s;ure you I do not write with a ce|&s;ire or di&s;po&s;ition to contradict, much le&s;s to di&s;gu&s;t you or any of your bapti&s;t brethren, tho' I know not but this may be the event But the aim I have in view, (however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeble the effort may be) is, by the divine ble&s;|&s;ing to endeavour to re&s;cue &s;ome injured truths, which have &s;uffered abu&s;e by your pen.&mdash;And under this con|&s;ideration I undertake it chearfully, but upon &s;ome other accounts it is with reluctance. For having had the hap to dip a little in one or two public controver&s;ies in time pa&s;t, I have of late almo&s;t come to a determination to let polemic &s;ubjects alone, (unle&s;s where the e&s;&s;entials of religion are controverted) and leave di&s;putes to other people, who have more plea&s;ure and better &s;kill therein than I, and higher expectations of doing good thereby. &mdash;Di&s;putes &s;eem of late to be almo&s;t fruitle&s;s as well as endle&s;s; and the more work of this nature there is done,
<PB N="4" REF="012076_0003_0F8993DF73976D90" MS="y">the more there is to do: and the more labourers there are who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter into this field of di&s;pute, the wider the field g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ows in proportion; and in con&s;ideration hereof, I have almo&s;t been ready to &s;ay, that the multiplied numbers of di&s;putants, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e times, had about as good &s;tand all the day id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s market place, as to &s;pend their time as they do &mdash; However, I tru&s;t I am not al|together &s;o &s;uper&s;titious o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mptuous as to a&s;&s;ert, as &s;ome have done, viz. <HI>That di&s;put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s never did any good.</HI> For I believe the reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of this is true, and that &s;ome times di&s;putes are really nece&s;&s;ary, and were it not for this, I would lay down my pen.&mdash;But with re&s;pect to the di&s;pute in favour of, and again&s;t in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bapti&s;m I intended to have been a neuter, (as to public writing I mean) becau&s;e I did not look upon it e&s;&s;ential to vital religion, which &s;ide a man &s;eteled in his judgment, in this affair, if he was con&s;ciencious, and truly per&s;waded in his own m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, &s;eeing both &s;ides have &s;o much of a plea, in their favour; and I doubt not but eminently good men are on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But, &s;ir, in reading your an&s;wer to Mr. F&mdash;'s letter in favour of infant bapti&s;m, I confe&s;s you have drawn me a little out from my &s;tate of neutrality; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I cannot be quite ea&s;y (however catholick) to &s;ee things glo&s;s'd &s;moothly, and then put off for truth, which are not.&mdash; However, being &s;o very aver&s;e to write upon this &s;ub|ject, I &s;hould not have meddled with it, had you ne|glected one thing in handling the controver&s;y, and that is, you &s;ay, <HI>That in order to maintain infant bapti&s;m, we con&s;true and interpret the new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tament by the old, and the old by the new,</HI> (p. 58). Now this was &s;o directly the rever&s;e of the truth re&s;pecting my e&s;tabli&s;hment in fa|vour of infant bapti&s;m, that I could not be ea&s;y, nor an&s;wer a good con&s;cience herein, to let it pa&s;s unnotic'd. And as it was the new te&s;tament interpretation of the old that gave me an e&s;tabli&s;hment concerning infant bap|ti&s;m; &s;o I am ready to think, that if the bapti&s;ts would
<PB N="5" REF="012076_0003_0F8993DF73976D90">&s;uffer the new te&s;tament interpretation of the old, to take place in their under&s;tandings, with their wills &s;ub|jected to the light of truth in this particular, they would ea&s;ily &s;ee more grounds for the warrant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bap|ti&s;m than now they can; for while they have a different way to interpret the old te&s;tament, from the new te&s;ta|ment interpretation thereof, it nece&s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly hides the truth, and the binding force of it from their minds, in this particular. And hence they peremtorily conclude that there is nothing in the &s;cripture to warrant infant bap|ti&s;m becau&s;e they in the&s;e circum&s;tances can't &s;ee it; but I can't allow this to be demon&s;tration&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e that it is very probable, the &s;olid and judicious among the bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ts, who did not receive the binding force of their principles by tradition, made their mi&s;take h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, viz they took intant bapti&s;m upon tradition only, and practiced without under&s;tanding therein, but afterwards when they came to be more con&s;ciencious in the point, and could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no further in the practice by tradition; and then they attempted to &s;earch whether there were a &s;cripture warrant for the practice or not, and when they read or heard the &s;criptures, the arguments, and interpretations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp;c. produced for the &s;up|port of infant bapti&s;m, they never took the proper ideas belonging thereto, and &s;o could &s;ee no proof, where others who take the ideas as well as the words, can. I know &s;omething of this by experience; for I my&s;elf took infant bapti&s;m upon tradition, and went on &s;o for near ten years after I was experimentally acquainted with religion, as I tru&s;t; in which time doctrinal reli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">: and, practical godline&s;s, was thro' grace, my de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lightful &s;tudy; but my mind was not turn'd upon bap|ti&s;m w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h any clo&s;ene&s;s of thought, all that while. &mdash; At length I became a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quainted with a bapti&s;t who was pre|ty apt to be rigid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> peremptory in his a&s;&s;ertions and principles, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old me there was neither precept nor example in the bible, for infant bapti&s;m, and that there
<PB N="6" REF="012076_0004_0F8993E0344925A8">was nothing to warrant the practice but humane tradi|tion. And moreover he &s;aid, that it was nothing but fear of reproach and &s;ingularity that kept multitudes of chri&s;tians from practicing upon the bapti&s;ts prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ples. &mdash; Well, I was con&s;cious I did not know much about the affair. I told him I would endeavour to &s;earch into the matter, and if there was nothing but humane tradition to warrant infant bapti&s;m, it was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me it was rejected. And as to reproach and &s;ingularity I had not much to fear from that quarter; for by my late embracing and adhearing &s;trictly to what I call congregational princi|ples, I was already reproached with the odious name of <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> which was look'd upon as a very ridicul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us thing where I then liv'd. Moreover I told him I tru&s;t|ed I had &s;et out through grace, to go where truth and hone&s;ty would carry me, and if embracing the truth would make me a bapti&s;t, I hoped I was willing to be one. I further told him I did not like &s;uch &s;udden &s;tars and changes about the principles of religion as I ob&s;erved in &s;ome men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was willing any man &s;hould change his religious traditions, provided he did it with due con&s;ideration deliberation and a &s;cripture warrant, and not el&s;e. If I ever bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me a bapti&s;t, I told him I intended to be &s;o well grounded in the principle, as not to have occa&s;ion to turn-back again, as I ob&s;erved &s;ome did.</P>
<P>And now I undertook to &s;earch the &s;cripture to find what the mind of God therein was; and I tru&s;t with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eere de&s;ire to know the truth, in order for practice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; for I had got a ground about practi&s;ing upon infant bapti&s;m any further upon tradition only. I did not think it my duty in &s;earching after the truth in this matter to pray for&punc; or expect any immediate revelation from God, to tell me which &s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay in the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ter. But that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God in the u&s;e of pro|per m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans, my under&s;tanding mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be led to &s;ee what his mind and will is; as it is already revealed in his holy
<PB N="7" REF="012076_0004_0F8993E0344925A8">word, altho' more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arkly in this point, than in &s;ome others&punc; And hereupon I read the &s;criptures, and au|thors upon both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and conver&s;ed with the able&s;t men in favour of infant bapti&s;m I knew of, to &s;ee what could be &s;aid to &s;upport the practice, which by this time I very much call'd in que&s;tion. The bapti&s;ts arguments look'd plau&s;ible, and for to get light in the affair, I &s;ometimes e&s;pou&s;ed the bapti&s;t &s;ide of the que&s;tion, when conver&s;ing with men who profe&s;t to be clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed in infant bapti&s;m, and it &s;eem'd to me they got along but poorly in proving their infant|bapti&s;m-&s;cheme. And my mind hung in &s;u&s;pence a con&s;iderable time, but it rather &s;eem'd to be my prevail|ing tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the truth lay on the bapti&s;ts &s;ide. Until, by reading the new-te&s;tament-interpretation of &s;ome parts of the old te&s;tament, and that in a light very dif|ferent from my bapti&s;ts authors, with that, I tho't, it may be here is &s;omething that I had hitherto over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|look'd, therefore I will look again; and while I follow|ed this line, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">z. the new te&s;tament interpretation of the old, the &s;ub&s;tance of the bapti&s;ts arguments were over|thrown, (at lea&s;t they were overthrown in my mind.) And then I began to take the ideas, as well as words, concerning the grounds of infant bapti&s;m. And my mind, I tru&s;t, was led into the nature and &s;pirituality of the vailed di&s;pen&s;ation. There appeared then, more go&s;pel, more grace, and more glory under the ancient and typical di&s;pen&s;ation, than ever I &s;aw before, or any bapti&s;t author I ever read, would allow. The bapti&s;ts authors indeed do allow, that there was &s;ome glory un|der that di&s;pen&s;ation, as things then typified the &s;piritual glory of the church in the go&s;pel day. But as that was a di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ation of the covenant of grace, &s;o I &s;ay that there was a &s;piritual glory then in being and exi&s;ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> vail'd with a type. There was then the &s;ame &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ritual good under the type, that there is now carried in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation without the type. And all
<PB N="8" REF="012076_0005_0F8993E0F439F308">who did not &s;tick in the letter, or as I may &s;ay the bark of that di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;aw the &s;piritual glory, and embraced the &s;piritual good, carried in the promi&s;e of the covenant of grace, and &s;eal'd the &s;ame, by tho&s;e &s;eals which God appointed there|for, what ever typical u&s;e they might an&s;wer be|&s;ides. And, &s;ir, when Mr. F. in his letter in fa|vour of infant bapti&s;m, is &s;peaking of that cove|nant which God made, or renewed with Abraham in the 17th of Gen. He &s;ays, <Q>altho' we don't read the word, Chri&s;t, nor grace, nor faith, nor new covenant,</Q> yet he &s;uppo&s;es that all this was implied, and that Chri&s;t and all his benefits were contain'd therein. And I &s;ay, amen to it! ble&s;|&s;ed and glorious truth! But you &s;ay (p. 53.) that with his man's wi&s;dom, in &s;o expounding that &s;cripture, that he contradicts in&s;piration. But I think that you are quite mi&s;taken, and that this a&s;&s;ertion of his entirely agrees with in&s;piration, (as I tru&s;t will appear more obvious in the &s;equel) unle&s;s you mean to call the bapti&s;ts writings in|&s;piration, then I know it differs.</P>
<P>But to proceed, Now as I &s;aid, it was the new te&s;tament interpretation of the old, that was the means which gave my mind the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment in favour of infant bapti&s;m, when I had been long he&s;itating there about.

I. <HI>Of God's Covenant with Abraham,</HI> which we find the fir&s;t di&s;covery of in 12th chap. of Gen. where God called Abraham and ble&s;&s;ed him, and promi&s;ed Canaan. And in the 15th ch. of Gen. we find the covenant renewed, a numerous &s;eed promi&s;ed, and a renewed promi&s;e of Canaan. And in the 17th ch. the covenant was renewed with Abraham again, and more explicit in &s;ome things; circumci&s;ion in&s;tituted, directions given for the forming his family into a church-&s;tate. And hence an external form of admini&s;tration of the covenant commenced according to divine ap|pointment. Now this covenant which God was plea&s;ed, out of &s;elf-moving love, to take Abraham into with him&s;elf, I call the covenant of grace, containing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, with &s;uch an ex|ternal form of admini&s;tration thereof, and belong|ing thereto, as God in his infinite wi&s;dom and &s;overeignty &s;aw fit to appoint.&mdash;For illu&s;tration, I &s;uppo&s;e you will allow, that under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, where God takes a man &s;avingly into covenant with him&s;elf, there are &s;ome externals, called <HI>privileges</HI> and <HI>duties</HI> annexed, and that the&s;e are included in, and belong to the external admi|ni&s;tration of the covenant of grace, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. So in the covenant with Abraham, there was certain duties and privileges annexed therewith, and belonged to the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, under that ancient di&s;pen&s;ation; which were thankfully to be acknowledged, and chearfully and punctually complied with, until God &s;hould plea&s;e to add thereto, more rites and ceremonies, or take them
<PB N="10" REF="012076_0006_0F8993E1B3A23748">all away, which were merely po&s;itive, and ap|point new ones at his plea&s;ure. And yet in every period we are to acknowlege the covenant of grace, altho' under a different form of external admini&s;tration.&mdash;The Abrahamatical form con|tinued a while.&mdash;At the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation, the moral law was promulgated, and all the rites of the ceremonial law were added to the external form of the admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, until the go&s;pel day commenced, and the form of admini&s;tration was altered.</P>
<P>But now let us look and &s;ee how the new te&s;|tament interprets God's covenant with Abraham. I find Paul is &s;peaking directly of this covenant with Abraham, Gal. 3.17, 18. <HI>And this I &s;ay, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chri&s;t, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot di&s;annul, that it &s;hould make the promi&s;e of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promi&s;e: But God gave it to Abraham by promi&s;e.</HI> Here the covenant with Abraham is &s;aid to be confirmed in Chri&s;t, and the inheritance given to him by promi&s;e. But what inheritance? why the heavenly inheritance, which is not obtain'd by the works of the law, but by free grace. But when did God give the inheritance to Abraham by promi&s;e? why in the promi&s;e of Canaan. Again, the new te&s;tament tells us Rom. 4.3. <HI>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Now if here was faith, imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ju&s;ti|fication without works, and &s;o Abraham had not whereof to glory before God, as the apo&s;tle &s;hews
<PB N="11" REF="012076_0006_0F8993E1B3A23748">in this chapter, then it mu&s;t certainly be the co|venant of grace; for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> covenant of works knows of no faith in a mediator, no imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s, no ju&s;tification without works. And to &s;up|po&s;e that the good carried in the promi&s;e of the covenant, which God took Abraham into, con|&s;i&s;ted &s;olely, or principally, in the temporal good of the type expre&s;&s;ed, is to contradict the new te&s;tament explaination of that covenant, and of the good contained in it, in the&s;e following chap|ters, which you may read at your lei&s;ure, viz. Rom. 4. Gal. 3. Heb. 11. Luke 1.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee whether your interpretation of Abraham's covenant agrees with the new te&s;ta|ment interpretation of it; and I think I find it don't You mu&s;t not expect, in a letter &s;o &s;hort as I intend this to be, that I make a collection of the bapti&s;t authors in general, and cite their words upon the point; for if you are as &s;ound and as or|thodox, in the point, as they be in general, then your words may be cited as a &s;pecimen of their general notion, about Abraham's covenant. You &s;ay, pag. 53, <Q>The tenor of Abraham's covenant enjoins conditions and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which expo&s;ed them to be cut off from their people.&mdash;Therefore the letter of it was <HI>do and live.</HI></Q> Here &s;ir, are your words, but I don't know what you really think Abraham's covenant was, notwith&s;tanding. Mr. F. &s;aid it was the covenant of grace, but you op|po&s;e him in that, and mean to contradict him, which is evident to every one who reads your an|&s;wer. And to me it is evident you contradict the
<PB N="12" REF="012076_0007_0F8993E2747C5B08">new te&s;tament interpretation of it, whether you mean it or no. You de&s;cribe the covenant with Abraham ju&s;t as the be&s;t of divines do the covenant of works made with innocent man, or Adam before the fall, <HI>do and live.</HI> And the &s;cripture de&s;cribes that ancient covenant of works, or the moral law as a covenant, in the &s;ame manner, <HI>He that doth them &s;hall live in them.</HI> Well then, if you mean &s;o, that is, if you mean as you &s;ay, that the tenor and letter of Abraham's covenant was <HI>works,</HI> do and live, then one of the&s;e things will certainly follow, viz that either, 1&s;t. One man is gone to heaven by the cove|nant of works, &s;ince the fall. Or, 2dly, Abraham is damned; for he never had a better covenant to go to heaven by than this. The language of it was, <HI>I will be thy God;</HI> and Paul &s;ays this covenant was confirmed in Chri&s;t. But if you don't mean Adam's &s;evere covenant of works, <HI>do and live,</HI> requiring perfect holine&s;s as the condition of life, but &s;ome more mild and moderate covenant of works, and yet di&s;tinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, I don't think it worth while to &s;pend time to talk about it: for if &s;uch a covenant ever exi&s;ted any where, 'twas but in men's imagination, for you never found &s;uch a covenant in Gene&s;is; nor from there to the end of the Revelations. But let us examine the force of your argument a little: You &s;ay, Abraham's covenant enjoins conditions and works to be perform'd by men; the neglect of which expo&s;ed them to be cut off from their people. Now by this argument you think to prove that the covenant with Abraham was not the covenant of grace, but of works. But &s;ir, your argument proves too much for you, and &s;o ju&s;t nothing at all. Your argument, if it was allowed to take place, would deny that God now under the go&s;pel takes his church into the covenant of grace, but the church is now form'd upon the covenant of works, <HI>do and live,</HI> for I tru&s;t that you your&s;elf will not deny but that in the external ad|mini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, even under the
<PB N="13" REF="012076_0007_0F8993E2747C5B08">go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, God enjoins duties and works to be perform'd by men, thro' grace influencing, as a condition of a vi&s;ible &s;tanding and continuance in God's vi&s;ible church, the neglect of which now expo&s;es them to be cut off from God's people by &s;olemn excommunication; and dying without repentance, mu&s;t be cut off by eter|nal damnation; and what do you find more condition|al, awful, and &s;evere in Abraham's covenant?&mdash;I grant that in the covenant of redemption, or if it &s;uits you better, the covenant of grace, as it was made with Chri&s;t in the behalf of the elect, Chri&s;t only was to perform the condition of their &s;alvation, by obeying the law, and &s;uffering the penalty thereof, in their room and &s;tead. And I allow that there were no works done by ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or fore&s;een, as the condition of election, but election was free, &s;overeign and ab&s;olute. I al&s;o allow further, that that faith, by which one is united to Chri&s;t, and by which the believer is &s;aid to be ju&s;tified, is the free gift of God, and no previous conditions are performed by men, as procuring a right and title to that grace.&mdash;But yet, not|with&s;tanding all this, I think I have a &s;cripture warrant to &s;ay, that in the go&s;pel declarations, and the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, there are con|ditions propo&s;ed and required. Salvation is promi&s;ed in the go&s;pel, to mankind in general, on the conditions of faith and repentance; and tho&s;e who don't through grace, come up to the&s;e conditions, are threatned with eternal damnation. So there are certain qualifications required, and duties to be performed, as a condition now, as well as in Abraham's day, of having a &s;tanding and continuance in God's vi&s;ible church. And what if you &s;hould now take the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, which requires conditions, enjoins duties, annexes penalties, &amp;c. and call it a covenant by it&s;elf, di&s;tinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, even the covenant of works; would not this be a vile aba&s;e of the covenant of grace?

Here was &s;uch plain ground to go upon, that it &s;eems you could not have &s;tumbled, and made this blunder, had you not took pains for it, or tho't to have &s;erved a turn by it.

<P>That this promi&s;e was fulfilled to Abraham and his &s;eed, according to the tenor of it, and is a fulfilling daily to believing Gentiles, and their &s;eed al&s;o.

<P>But then ob&s;erve, as I noted before, how Abraham's covenant is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e con&s;idered, viz. That it was the co|venant of grace, containing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in the promi&s;e, with &s;uch an external form of admini&s;tration thereof as God in his wi&s;dom and &s;overeignty he &s;aw fit to appoint. And that you may not mi&s;take me here|in I will explain my&s;elf a little further. Doubtle&s;s you will allow it to be po&s;&s;ible, if not in fact the ca&s;e, that God may, in a way of &s;overeign grace, take a man &s;av|ingly into covenant with him&s;elf from the mid&s;t of an heathen land, convey grace into his heart, bring him into union to Chri&s;t, grant him communion with God here, in this world, and eternal life hereafter; and &s;ave him by Chri&s;t, in the way of free grace; and yet never bring him under any external admini&s;tration of the co|venant of grace, bring him into no vi&s;ible church, of any form of con&s;titution, give him no external &s;eals or ordinances, of a po&s;&s;itive nature, &amp;c. And if God in his wi&s;dom and &s;overeignty had &s;een fit to call in all his elect in this wi&s;e, by the &s;ecret influences of his Spirit, and never had appointed any external form of admini|&s;tration to the covenant of grace at all: Mu&s;t not all creatures have yielded that God had a right to act his
<PB N="18" REF="012076_0010_0F8993E5C236C5C0">plea&s;ure? when it was his own free grace he was going to be&s;tow? Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n't he do what he will with his own? and as to the method, take what way he plea&s;es?</P>
<P>But we find God has not always took that method of calling in his elect, if he did ever; but has been plea&s;ed to appoint an external form of admini&s;tration of the co|venant of grace. And &s;urely God was at liberty to de|termine what this form &s;hould be, whether it &s;hould be always alike, or whether it &s;hould differ in various peri|ods of the church, the latter of which we find to be his will. Now one of the&s;e external forms of the admini|&s;tration of the covenant of grace, which was to continue a certain period in the church, God was plea&s;ed to give to Abraham. For when God took Abraham &s;avingly into covenant with him&s;elf, and determined a vi&s;ible and outward di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace &s;hould appear, he had a right al&s;o to determine whether any but Abraham, and &s;uch as with him had &s;aving faith, &s;hould have any concern herein, or privilege hereby; and in way of &s;overeignty God was plea&s;ed to connect Abra|ham's children with Abraham him&s;elf, in the external admini&s;tration of his gracious covenant. So that it be|came Abraham's duty, and his children's privilege, for him to apply the &s;eal of his faith, and the token or bond of God's gracious covenant to them. And a great fa|vour it was, if prized and improved as it ought to be, to &s;tand thus related to God by his own gracious cove|nant and &s;overeign appointment; tho' not &s;o as to ob|tain &s;alvation without faith: But here, by way of emin|ence, they have the ble&s;&s;ed means, and the greate&s;t obligation to faith.</P>
<P>But I am &s;en&s;ible that the objection is not yet fully an&s;wered, the pinch of the objection is here; if it was the covenant of grace, containing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, in which God &s;aid to Abraham, <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> and if God &s;ays the &s;ame to believers now, why don't all their &s;eed have &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, and be &s;aved? To which I directly an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012076_0010_0F8993E5C236C5C0">
The objection takes that for granted which is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue, viz that this promi&s;e, <HI>to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> can't be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> covenant of grace, unle&s;s all the &s;eed of believers a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aved: whereas it is not &s;o&mdash;God &s;aid to Abraham for|merly, and to believers now, <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> that is, to thee and to thy &s;eed indefinitely; i. e. not to be confin'd to all individuals of their &s;eed.

<P>But to proceed, If Abraham's covenant was not the covenant of grace, and re&s;pected things of a &s;piritual nature, what was the matter that he was not a Jew which was one outwardly? If that covenant re&s;pected the na|tural &s;eed of Abraham as &s;uch, and as &s;uch to remain the &s;ubjects of the covenant, and the good promi&s;ed was only outward Canaan; and the requirements of the co|venant, was only outward circumci&s;ion, and an external conformity to outward rites and ceremonies: I &s;ay, if this was the ca&s;e, is the bapti&s;ts plead, then he was a Jew in the compleare&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of that coven|ant, who was one outwardly; for according to them, that covenant re&s;pected, required, nor granted nothing but outward things.</P>
<P>I grant, that in Abraham's covenant there were &s;ome things that re&s;pected his natural &s;eed, as &s;uch, viz that God would multiply them, make a great nation of them, give the land of Canaan to them. But the&s;e things were but a mere circum&s;tance; and as I may &s;ay &s;ome appendages added, and not the e&s;&s;ence and &s;ub|&s;tantial part of the covenant. Now by the&s;e appenda|ges attending Abraham's covenant God was plea&s;ed to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d them as very &s;ignificant things, and as types to preach, teach, illu&s;trate, and &s;hadow forth the &s;piritual good and glory contained in the &s;ub&s;tantial part, the e&s;&s;ence and &s;piritually of Abraham's covenant. Abra|ham's numerous natural &s;eed promi&s;ed, typified the &s;ub|jects of the covenant of grace, or his &s;piritual &s;eed a|mong both Jews and Gentiles, as God was plea&s;ed to honour him with the title of being called the father o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="21" REF="012076_0011_0F8993E63317E908">all the faithful. And the gift of Canaan to Abraham's natural &s;eed, typified the heavenly inheritance, given in Abraham's covenant, or the covenant of grace to all true believers. So that there was truly a go&s;pel cove|nant, and go&s;pel doctrines, and go&s;pel ble&s;&s;ings in A|braham's day. Now for the bapti&s;t to take the&s;e ap|pendages, the&s;e typical things in Abraham's covenant, and try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make the very e&s;&s;ence of that covenant to con&s;i&s;t in them, is a vile abu&s;e of Abraham's covenant, and a counteracting the new te&s;tament interpretation of that covenant, as we have &s;een in part already, and may &s;ee more in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>But &s;ir, I mu&s;t not forget to con&s;ider the main pillar you ground your opinion upon; and your chief engine which you think to beat down all our arguments and proof, that Abraham's covenant was the covenant of grace. And that is what we find in Heb. 8. And e&s;|pecially tho&s;e words cited by the apo&s;tle from the pro|phecy of Jeremiah, ver. 8, 9, 10. <HI>Behold the days come, &s;aith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> &amp;c. Now what &s;eeming proof there is in the&s;e words, or whole chapter, to e&s;tabli&s;h the bap|ti&s;t in the opinion that Abraham's covenant was not the covenant of grace, is wholly founded on a mi&s;take: which I think I can ea&s;ily &s;hew, and demon&s;trate to eve|ry rational mind that will attend without prejudice,</P>
<P>And this I &s;hall do by con&s;idering two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. That neither the prophet Jeremiah in his prophe|cy, nor the apo&s;tle Paul in the Hebrews, do oppo&s;e this new covenant which the Lord would make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to Abraham's covenant; but they op|po&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;omething el&s;e, which is quite evident if we do but attend clo&s;ely to the matter. Do but &s;ee how the words run. <HI>Behold the days come, &s;aith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah: not according to the covenant I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the Land of Egypt.</HI> Now if
<PB N="22" REF="012076_0012_0F8993E6F441B750">the words had run thus, I will make a new covenant, &amp;c.&mdash;not according to the covenant I made with their fathers, when I took Abraham by the band, and called him out from his kindred and ble&s;&s;ed him, &amp;c. I &s;ay if the words had run thus, I would freely give up the point to you, and allow the new covenant &s;poken of in Heb. 8. is in op|po&s;ition to Abraham's covenant. But I find the words of in&s;piration run quite another way, even to Egypt and Mount Sinai. Therefore take no|tice of them again. I will make a new covenant &mdash;<HI>not according to the covenant I made with their fathers</HI>&mdash;But when?&mdash;<HI>in the DAY I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.</HI> Now it is as evident as words can make it, that this covenant &s;poken of, to which the new cove|nant is &s;aid to be made in oppo&s;ition to, was not made in Abraham's day, but four hundred and thirty years after, when the children of I&s;rael came out of Egypt, and the Sinai-law given; (for we may note, that the Sinai-law was given the &s;ame year that I&s;rael went out of Egypt); &s;o that I have a right to tell you in the words of the apo&s;tle, Gal. 3.17. And this I &s;ay, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chri&s;t, (that is Abraham's covenant, as tis called) the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot di&s;annul. So that the covenant with Abraham, being the covenant of grace, as to the e&s;&s;ence and &s;ub&s;tance of it, &s;till continues. But if you a&s;k what covenant it was, if it was nor A|braham's covenant that the new covenant in Heb. 8. is oppo&s;ed to? I an&s;wer, that it is evident by

<P>So that this new covenant &s;poken of Heb. 8. is &s;o far from really oppo&s;ing Abraham's coven|ant, that it does really accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd thing I propo&s;ed, or intended to con&s;ider, as a proof that this new covenant, Heb. 8. was not oppo&s;ed to Abraham's, is, be|cau&s;e the effects and ble&s;&s;ings of Abraham's co|venant, and the effects and ble&s;&s;ings of this new covenant are one: Now oppo&s;ite covenants don't meet in onene&s;s of effect. But I have partly pre|vented my&s;elf herein, by what I have &s;aid already. However, I will ju&s;t add a word or two more.</P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider the effect and ble&s;&s;ings of this new covenant, &s;poken of in Heb. 8. <HI>I will put my law in their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people.</HI> Here is the effect and ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant you allow. And I tru&s;t you will not deny but that the privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant are &s;poken of in other pla|ces of &s;cripture, as well as this; and altho' not contradictory to this, yet with more enlargements on the privileges, and more minutely particular therein. And as the apo&s;tle cites this pa&s;&s;age in Heb. 8.10. from the 31. ch. of Jer. &s;o I tru&s;t you can't deny but the next chapter, viz. Jer. 32.38.39. &s;peaks out al&s;o the promi&s;e of the new covenant, or covenant of grace. <HI>And they &s;hall be my people, and I will be their God. And I will
<PB N="26" REF="012076_0014_0F8993E874432E50">give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.</HI> So al&s;o is the promi&s;e of the new covenant &s;poken out in the 44. of I&s;a. ver. 3. <HI>For I will pour water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thine off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spring.</HI> Now let us in a word, con&s;ider the effect and ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant with Abraham. And we find, that when God graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to enter into the&s;e covenant engagements by his own free promi&s;e, he tells us what he meant by it, Gen. 17.7. &s;peaking to Abraham; <HI>To be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> The very &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings carried in tho&s;e other promi&s;es of the new covenant, tho' not here &s;o much enlarg|ed upon, nor &s;o explicit, in their &s;piritual nature. For the go&s;pel, and covenant of grace, and the &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings thereof, open'd gradually. But if at every degree of new openings, of the privi|leges of the covenant of grace, and enlargements thereof, and explicit promi&s;es made; I &s;ay, if we &s;hould call the &s;ame, at every &s;uch period, another covenant, in&s;tead of the &s;ame more enlightned into, we &s;hould have new covenants, and new go&s;pels plenty enough in the bible. But when God &s;ays in Abraham's covenant, I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed, means no le&s;s than the &s;ame &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings contain'd in the new covenant, el&s;ewhere expre&s;&s;ed by a more particular de&s;crip|tion of the ble&s;&s;ings involved in the&s;e words, <HI>I will be thy God, and the God of thy &s;eed.</HI> As pouring his Spirit upon them, giving them a new
<PB N="27" REF="012076_0014_0F8993E874432E50">heart, and writing his laws in their heart, &amp;c. So we may look upon Deut. 30.6. a true ex|planation of Abraham's covenant: <HI>The Lord thy God will circumci&s;e thy heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed, to love the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;urely this is the &s;ame &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing of having the law of God written in the heart. And when God &s;ays, by way of covenant, <HI>I will be thy God,</HI> &s;ince the fall of Adam, it is evermore new covenant language, and new covenant ble&s;&s;ing referred to.</P>
<P>But I find bapti&s;t authors, and I think you a|mong the number, do allow, that in Abraham's covenant, that God did engage to be externally their God, altho' it was the covenant of works, that did not carry &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in the pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>Now here I would ju&s;t remark two things, for there is not a bapti&s;t among you all, but allow that in Abraham's covenant there were great fa|vours thereby conferred upon the &s;ubjects of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay that Abraham's covenant cannot be the covenant of works, &s;ay what you will, if there were any favours or ble&s;&s;ings at all in it, either &s;piritual or temporal. For the nature and pro|perty of the covenant of works, is to give life to &s;inle&s;s, or perfect obedience, &amp; to cur&s;e the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, and be&s;tow no mercy on the &s;inner, no not the lea&s;t even of a temporal nature. And altho' God does be&s;tow many favours on &s;inners, who are under the law, as a covenant of works, yet he does not do it by the covenant of works, or in the way of the covenant of works; but in a way of &s;overeign grace thro' the Mediator, which the covenant of works knows nothing of.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="012076_0015_0F8993E933F42BC0">
2 What kind of a covenant, and what kind of a ble&s;&s;ing is this? for God to engage to a people or a per&s;on, to be their God externally? and the perform|ance to be according to the engagement. The plain Engli&s;h of it is this, that Jehovah <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s their God in word, but the covenant leaves the devil to be their God in deed.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, &s;ir, that you allow that Abraham was an eminent &s;aint, and was &s;omehow, in the covenant of grace, but that covenant in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The bapti&s;ts pretend, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, that there is an ab&s;urdity in holding the covenant with Abraham, to be the coven|ant of grace, the promi&s;e of which was, <HI>I will be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee;</HI> and to hold that believers are under the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me co|venant and promi&s;e now; and yet to allow that many of Abraham's children were not &s;aved, and many of the children of believers now under the go&s;pel are al&s;o not &s;aved: they are therefore very aver&s;e to allowing that the&s;e words in the promi&s;e, <HI>and to thy &s;eed after thee,</HI> &s;hould be con&s;idered indefinitely, that is not to fix ab&s;olutely upon each individual, but only <HI>of their &s;eed.</HI> But then, if they &s;hould once allow this, they charge us o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being guilty of another great ab&s;urdity in bapti&s;ing all the children of believers promi&s;cuou&s;ly; why don't we wait, &s;ay they, until we &s;ee on whom the promi&s;e is made effica|cious by their &s;aving conver&s;ion? and then apply the &s;eal of the covenant, where the &s;aving effects of the covenant are fir&s;t &s;een.

<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>That the&s;e ab&s;urdities are not real, but only &s;eeming, as I &s;uppo&s;e they do &s;eem ab&s;urdities to a bapti&s;t. But what I would remark in this marginal note is, that the bapti&s;ts interpretation of Abraham's covenant has &s;eeming ab&s;urdities ju&s;t &s;imilar to the&s;e, and &s;ome <HI>real ones</HI> to boot.</P>
<P>Now the bapti&s;ts &s;ay that in Abraham's covenant, as it re&s;pected his natural &s;eed God engaged to be their God in outward re&s;pects, would give them outward privileges and the land of Canaan, and en|join'd certain outward duties upon them, and circumci&s;ion in the fle&s;h as a &s;eal of this national kind of a covenant of works.</P>
<P>Now how can this promi&s;e be under&s;tood, even upon this explana|tion of the covenant? Did the promi&s;e reach each individual ab&s;o|lutely? No. I&s;hmael and his &s;eed, were not intended in the promi&s;e, when God told Abraham I will give all the land of Canaan to thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee. How can the promi&s;e be true then? un|le&s;s all Abraham's &s;eed be meant in the promi&s;e? Why here the bap|ti&s;ts mu&s;t under&s;tand the promi&s;e indifinitely, and then it is true.&mdash; Well, but if circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of this covenant, in which Cana|an was promi&s;ed indefinitely to Abraham's &s;eed, why did they not wait until God had told them which line &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s Canaan, whe|ther I&s;hmael's or I&s;aac's, before they circumci&s;ed any? and not go and &s;et the &s;eal of a certain covenant upon I&s;hmael that never was de&s;igned to po&s;&s;e&s;s the good contain'd in that covenant. What is this but to &s;et a &s;eal to a blank? But the bapti&s;ts will &s;ay in this ca&s;e, God po&s;itively commanded it, he commanded Abraham to circumci&s;e I&s;hmael as well as I&s;aac. I an&s;wer, I know it, and I think that is enough to make the bapti&s;ts hold their tongues, and never bring this objection again&s;t infant bapti&s;m any more, <HI>that 'tis ab&s;urd, like &s;et|ting a &s;eal to a blank;</HI> for as ab&s;urd as it is. God commanded it in a &s;imilar ca&s;e. But one real ab&s;urdity I &s;hall here mention, as nece&s;&s;a|rily following the bapti&s;ts interpretation of Abraham's covenant, while they deny it to be the covenant of grace, and that the promi&s;e of it, as it re&s;pected Abraham's natural &s;eed, bad no reference to &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, but temporal only. The ab&s;urdity is this, viz. <HI>That the jewi&s;h nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ood related to God by covenant, as creatures which had no &s;ouls, and the breach of the covenant in them would have been no &s;in.</HI> For the obedience the covenant required, was but external, and the good promi&s;ed in the covenant if it be kept, is but temporal. There|fore if they break it, they mu&s;t not be charged with &s;in nor puni&s;hed with hell. For to &s;uppo&s;e immortal &s;ouls will be puni&s;hed eternally in hell for the breach of covenant with God, which if they had ful|filled the terms of, would not have rewarded them with heaven, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab&s;urd with a witne&s;s. For altho' the bapti&s;t &s;ome times pretend that Abraham's covenant was the covenant of works, yet at other times they repre&s;ent it as a meer outward thing, neither the covenant of works nor the covenant of grace.</P></NOTE> Gen. 17. of which circum|ci&s;ion
<PB N="29" REF="012076_0015_0F8993E933F42BC0">was the &s;eal, was not it, but the covenant of works, likewi&s;e the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation was the covenant of works; and if &s;o, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aints from Abraham down to the go&s;pel day, were under the covenant of works, and went to heaven under the covenant of works; or el&s;e &s;ome how, without God's leave, they &s;lipt their necks out of the covenant of works, and &s;tole away to heaven in &s;ecret: I &s;ay without God's leave, becau&s;e God never gave his &s;aints any liberty while that di&s;pen&s;ation la&s;ted, to depart from tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which the bapti&s;t &s;ay, were of, and belonged to, the covenant of works. But I apprehend the grounds of your mi&s;take to be truly this, that you take the external form of the admini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="30" REF="012076_0016_0F8993E9F3FDC0E0">of the covenant of grace, and make in your own minds, a di&s;tinct covenant of it, by it&s;elf, even the co|venant of works, as I before noted.</P>
<P>II. I now in the &s;econd place, as it was propo&s;ed, proceed to con&s;ider the new te&s;tament interpretation of circumci&s;ion. I ob&s;erve &s;ir, that in trying to get along with your &s;cheme in denying Abraham's to be the cove|nant of grace, one while you repre&s;ent circumci&s;ion to be a &s;eal of the covenant of works, <HI>do and live,</HI> and then &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m to try to make Abraham's covenant to con&s;i&s;t in circumci&s;ion, or that circumci&s;ion was the covenant it|&s;elf, as I before noted. But I am after a more authen|tic interpretation of circumci&s;ion, than I take yours to be, even the new te&s;tament interpretation. And that tells us without he&s;itation, how we are to con&s;ider cir|cumci&s;ion. Rom. 4.11. <HI>He received the &s;ign of circum|ci&s;ion, a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he had.</HI> Now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, is nothing &s;hort of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s apprehended by faith, and &s;uch evangeli|cal obedience as is the effect of true faith; which is go&s;|pel righteou&s;ne&s;s, as truly as any believer has now under the go&s;pel, and &s;eals by bapti&s;m. Therefore circumci|&s;ion was not appointed as a &s;eal of the covenant of works, becau&s;e it was appointed to &s;eal a righteou&s;ne&s;s that never belonged to the covenant of works, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, which is go&s;pel-righteou&s;ne&s;s, and evermore belongs to the covenant of grace. What will you do then for proof, that circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of the covenant of works? It may be you will have re|cour&s;e to Gal. 5.3, 4. where the apo&s;tle tells them that <HI>Every man</HI> (among them) <HI>that is circumci&s;ed, is a debtor to do the whole law. Chri&s;t is become of none effect unto you: who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the law, ye are falle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from grace.</HI> Now ina&s;much as the bapti&s;ts think this text to be much in their favour, as a proof that circum|ci&s;ion belonged to the covenant of works, becau&s;e tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Paul told the Galations that if they became circumci&s;ed
<PB N="31" REF="012076_0016_0F8993E9F3FDC0E0">they were debtors to do the whole law, &amp;c. Therefore we will take this matter a little under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Now when Paul &s;ays to the Galations, If ye become circumci&s;ed, ye are debtors to do the whole law; if he means the ceremonial law, then he would let them know that by being circumci&s;ed, they brought them&s;elves un|der an obligation, by that, to come under that heavy yoke, in all its branches, which Peter told his jewi&s;h bre|thren was a yoke which neither their fathers nor they were able to bear, Acts 15.10.</P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tle has a more &s;pecial re|ference to the moral law, as containing the &s;ub&s;tance of the covenant of works. And when Paul told the Ga|latians, that if they became circumci&s;ed, they would be debtors to do the whole law, viz. get a perfect law righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, &s;uch as the law demands. But he don't &s;ay that circumci&s;ion originally, and in&s;ti|tutionally, laid all under an obligation to perform the covenant of works in order to ju&s;tification: altho' cir|cum&s;tantially con&s;idered, and eventually it did the Ga|latians, and many of the &s;elf-righteous Jews, thro' their &s;inful abu&s;e, and wicked perverting the right order and u&s;e of things, as I &s;hall &s;hew. And that we may &s;ee in the light of truth how it came about that circumci&s;ion laid the &s;elf-righteous Jews, and the Galations who were corrupted by them, under an obligation to do the whole law, or perform the covenant of works, as a condition of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, we &s;hall con&s;ider their a|bu&s;e, and mi&s;u&s;e of, both the Sinai-di&s;pen&s;ation, and circumci&s;ion. And this I find Paul has done to our hands already, in his allegory concerning Abraham's two wives; a very natural and beautiful &s;imilitude, re|pre&s;enting the ca&s;e in a true and &s;triking light. Now Sarah was a free woman, and in the allegory repre&s;ents the covenant of grace. Hagar was a bond-woman and &s;he repre&s;ented the law, as the covenant of works; or the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation received in the form of the cove|nant
<PB N="32" REF="012076_0017_0F8993EAB3999840">of works. Now ob&s;erve, that Hagar in her fir&s;t and proper &s;tation, was Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah's hand maid, to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and &s;o long as &s;he did &s;o, and kept in that capacity, all was harmonious, well, and quiet in the fa|mily: but when Hagar came to be removed from the place of a &s;ervant, to the place of a wife, gets into Sarah's place, and bears a &s;on to Abraham, all is in confu&s;ion, and great di&s;turbance in the family. Altho' Hagar was a good &s;ervant, and would have done well in that capa|pacity; yet &s;he was not fit to be made a wife of, for being a bond woman her &s;elf, her children are born in bondage, and not properly heirs of the inheritance. Therefore, what &s;aith the &s;cripture? Ca&s;t out the bond woman, and her &s;on; for he &s;hall not be heir with the &s;on of the free woman. Now when this is done, and Sarah comes to be wife alone, as &s;he ought to have been before; and bears Abraham a &s;on, who is free, and truly the heir, and abundantly ble&s;&s;ed; now all things are &s;et right again, and peace takes place in the family.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e things are an allegory, &s;aith Paul, and thus he applies it: Satah repre&s;ents Abraham's coven|ant, or the covenant of grace made known to Abraham, into which God was plea&s;ed, of his &s;elf-moving love, to take him, giving him &s;aith, the pardon of &s;in, and eter|nal life altogether as the effect of free grace; not of works, lea&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t, and &s;o Abraham had not wherewith to glory before God, Rom. 4.2. And this covenant of grace was propo&s;ed to Abraham, as the only way of life to fallen man, and looked that God would ble&s;s his &s;eed, in the &s;ame way and manner that he had ble&s;&s;ed him, viz. of free grace, in and thro' the promi&s;ed &s;eed, on whom alone he depended for &s;pirit|ual ble&s;&s;ings, both for him&s;elf and his &s;eed, according to God's gracious promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, four hundred and thirty years after this, the Sinai-di&s;pen&s;ation was given, and Paul &s;hews that it was not given to oppo&s;e the covenant of grace, nor to
<PB N="33" REF="012076_0017_0F8993EAB3999840" MS="y">propo&s;e another way of life. Is the law then again&s;t the promi&s;es of God? God forbid. Gal 3 21. But the Sinai law was given, to help forward the &s;alvation of &s;inners by free grace, and not to hinder it. And therefore the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation in its true and proper u&s;e, was to be like Hagar, in her fir&s;t &s;tation, which was to &s;erve Sarah. And the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation was well calculated for this end; for there the moral law was fir&s;tly publi&s;hed, which if under&s;tood aright, &s;hews &s;inners their death; &amp; then the ceremonial law, which if rightly under&s;tood would have &s;hewn them the way of life, viz. by the way of free grace. And &s;o Paul labours to &s;hew and convince &s;elf-righteous men, that the law never was given at S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nai, for men to get life by their own obedience to it, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> life mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> come by free grace. He puts a que&s;tion for them in their mouths; <HI>Wherefore then &s;erveth the law?</HI> Gal. 3 19 He an&s;wers, <HI>It was added becau&s;e of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions</HI> &mdash;And again, <HI>The law entred that the offence might abound;</HI> that is, that they might &s;ee their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions and abounding &s;ins, and &s;o the need they &s;tood in of a Saviour. And &s;o &s;ays Paul concerning the Si|nai-law, it was ordain'd by angels in the hand of a Me|diator, and therefore to &s;ub&s;erve the covenant of grace, if rightly under&s;tood and improved.</P>
<P>But now the carnal and &s;elf-righteous Jews made a great mi&s;take here, concerning the right application, and improvement of the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation. For in&s;tead of being convinced by the moral law, of &s;in, and pe|ri&s;hing condition in them&s;elves; and in&s;tead of fleeing to Chri&s;t the only remedy, pointed out in the ceremo|nial law, they &s;ub&s;titute the duties there enjoined, in|&s;tead of Chri&s;t, and &s;o make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own doings, and hereby marry the law as a covenant of works, and &s;o remove Hagar from the place of &s;er|vant to the place of wife, and &s;o the bond woman brings forth children; and a dreadful bondage they are in, bound upon the pain of eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nation by the co|venant of works to which they cleave, to produce a
<PB N="34" REF="012076_0018_0F8993EB73EF97E0">perfect law-righteou&s;ne&s;s, without the lea&s;t defect; and for the want of it, will at la&s;t be ca&s;t out and rejected, from having any inheritance in the heavenly world, and hell mu&s;t be their portion. <HI>For they who are of the works of the law are under the cur&s;e.</HI> And indeed this is the ca&s;e with &s;elf-righteous men now, as well as it was with the Jews and the Galatians of old, when any &s;ub&s;titute rites and forms, and their own works, altho' under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, in&s;tead of Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;|ne&s;s, the bond-woman brings forth children yet, that mu&s;t as a&s;&s;uredly be ca&s;t out, as ever I&s;hmael was.</P>
<P>Now I apprehend it is quite plain from Paul's epi&s;tle to the Galatians that it is in this light he tells them, that if they became circumci&s;ed they would be debtors to do the whole law; that if they &s;et out upon that foot|ing, even &s;o far as to be circumci&s;ed, under a notion that it was part of their ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s, (which they did, it &s;eems, and hence was &s;o loth to give it up) then they mu&s;t go a thorow &s;tich with it, and get a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as perfect as it demands; as he &s;hews abundantly it mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wholly of works, or wholly of grace. Now if Paul had look'd upon it that circumci&s;ion in every circum&s;tance, laid the &s;ubject of it under an obligation to do the whole law, in point of ju&s;tification, he never would have circumci&s;ed Timothy when he did. He knew that circumci&s;ion as Abraham practi&s;ed it, was a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, and as he practi&s;ed it, when he circumci&s;ed Timothy it was but a meer indif|ferent thing. But as the &s;elf-righteous Jews and Gala|tians did it, he &s;aw it was like to prove fatal to their &s;ouls; hence he earne&s;tly di&s;&s;wades them from it. If the Jews had univer&s;ally under&s;tood, and improved the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation as they ought, and kept Hagar as a &s;ervant, and not married her as a wife, circumci&s;ion would have &s;ealed no other righteou&s;ne&s;s than that of faith, as it did to Abraham, and other true believers, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">itive in&s;titution of it; neither
<PB N="35" REF="012076_0018_0F8993EB73EF97E0">would they have been &s;o tenacious of the outward cere|mony of it, when the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation had aboli&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e the &s;elf-righteous Jews mi&s;improved the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation, and married the law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a coven|ant of works, and mi&s;applied circumci&s;ion, and made it a bond of that covenant to them&s;elves; you and other bapti&s;t writers, pretend that this were the nature and de&s;ign of the&s;e things in reality; that the Sina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;pen|&s;ation was given of God as the covenant of works, and that the Jewi&s;h church was form'd by God upon the covenant of works, and circumci&s;ion in&s;tituted of God as the &s;eal of the covenant of works. But your opinion herein is wholly on the &s;end of &s;ad mi&s;take, as the new te&s;tament &s;hews. Tho' &s;o much is true. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reely allow, that when the &s;elf righteous folks do cleave to the cove|nant of works as being agreeable to their legal temper, and wicked hearts, God holds them to the terms of that covenant they choo&s;e, and damns them eternally accor|ding to the &s;trictne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>But to &s;uppo&s;e that the chief end and de&s;ign of the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation was to give forth a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of works, and form the Jewi&s;h church upon that covenant, is ab&s;urd with a wit|ne&s;s. I apprehend the natural tendency and de&s;ign of the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation, when any thro' grace, fell in with the true de&s;ign of it, was on purpo&s;e to bring the Jews off from the covenant of works, to which they and all men naturally are very fond of cleaving. It &s;eems, that there God acted out, in an external di&s;pen&s;ation, what he does internally by his Spirit upon every &s;oul he brings off from the covenant of works, and to a com|pliance with the covenant of grace, in true conver&s;ion. Fir&s;t the Spirit of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets home the law upon the &s;in|ner's heart, not with a de&s;ign to make the man cleave to the law as a covenant of works, but with a contrary de&s;ign, viz. to make him cleave from the law, as a co|venant,
<PB N="36" REF="012076_0019_0F8993EC33F9DCC8">under&s;tanding its &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity. So in the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation, the moral law came forth in aw|ful terror, containing the nature and &s;ub&s;tance of the covenant of works, cur&s;ing the &s;inner, to humble their pride, and make them &s;en&s;ible they &s;tood in need of a Mediator, and &s;o to fall in with the covenant of grace; and &s;o the law was to &s;ub&s;erve the go&s;pel, and as Ha|gar in her right place, was to &s;erve Sarah, and &s;o the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation was to help forward and promote the &s;alvation of &s;inners by the covenant of grace. And thus I think it mu&s;t appear to every under&s;tanding and unprejudiced mind, that circumci&s;ion laid the Galati|ans and many of the &s;elf-righteous Jews, under an ob|ligation to perform the covenant of works, or get a perfect law-righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, not from God's in&s;titution, order, de&s;ign and appointment, (had they fallen in with that) but from their own wicked perver|&s;ion of things, viz their mi&s;u&s;ing and mi&s;improving the law, and mi&s;applying circumci&s;ion. For my part I wonder how you, and other bapti&s;ts, who pretend to be &s;uch new-te&s;tament men, dare venture to go &s;o right a|brea&s;t again&s;t the new-te&s;tament interpretation of cir|cumci&s;ion, which declares, (as it was in&s;tituted and rightly improved) it a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith. How can it then properly and truly belong to the covenant of works?</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, &s;ir, that you, and &s;ome other bapti&s;t writ|ers, in order to get along with your &s;cheme in annexing circumci&s;ion with the in&s;titution of the covenant of works, you choo&s;e to &s;ay little or nothing about this text, Rom. 4.11.

If you &s;hould a&s;k me why I conjecture &s;o, I will tell you one rea&s;on of it, and I think a &s;ub&s;tantial one, viz. That I have conver&s;ed with many of the bapti&s;t, one time or another, who a&s;&s;ert as you do, that circumci&s;ion was not a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, but of the covenant of works. Then only a&s;k them how they reconcile that a&s;&s;ertion with Paul's words, Rom. 4 11. where he &s;ays, Abraham received the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion, a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith. And they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e puzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, they will ne&s;tle round, and &s;hift the conver&s;ation, and &s;eem to be as afraid to have this text held up before them, as they would be (by way of compari&s;on) of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Can|non; and I never yet was able to obtain a rational an|&s;wer to &s;uch a que&s;tion, by all I ever conver&s;ed with, nor don't know how they mean to reconcile it, as rati|onal creatures, to &s;atisfy their own minds and con&s;cien|ces in the affair.</P>
<P>But what I have ob&s;erved is not the only proof that circumci&s;ion was the &s;eal, token, or bond of the cove|nant of grace, as really as bapti&s;m is now, altho' under a different di&s;pen&s;ation. Let us therefore con&s;ider this matter a little further. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m were of divine appointment, and con&s;i&s;ted of an exter|nal &s;ign, and a &s;piritual mi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry &s;ignified there by: and altho' the outward &s;ign of circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m dif|fer, yet the inward and &s;piritual &s;ignification of them but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> very much agree in one, as to the e&s;&s;ential things therein, and point at one and the &s;ame thing, and there|fore both belonged to one and the &s;ame covenant. Let us &s;ee in the &s;piritual m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tery, &s;omewhat of their one|ne&s;s, agreement and harmony, altho' their outward &s;ign differs.</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion in the outward &s;ign of it, was that cir|cumci&s;ion
<PB N="38" REF="012076_0020_0F8993ECF3EA19A0">which was &s;aid to be made with hands; the &s;piritual mi&s;tery &s;ignified thereby was that circumci&s;ion made without hands, viz. heart cir|cumci&s;ion, the effect of renewing grace.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m, in the outward &s;ign of it, is the ap|plication of water in a &s;acred manner ordinancial|ly, or the wa&s;hing with water; "I baptize you with water," &s;ays John. The inward mi&s;tery &s;ignified thereby is the bapti&s;m of the holy Gho&s;t and of fire; or the inward wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing from &s;in in the blood of Chri&s;t; or the wa&s;hing of regeneration and renewings of the holy Gho&s;t, which is the &s;ame thing with heart circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again, if the&s;e ordinances are con&s;idered as a convictive &s;ign, both of our di&s;ea&s;e and remedy, there &s;eems to be an agreement here. Circum|ci&s;ion, rightly under&s;tood, doubtle&s;s carries a con|viction and an acknowlegement of defilement, by natural generation, the &s;ign it&s;elf very &s;ignificant|ly &s;eems to point that out; and the &s;ign being painful and bloody, carries al&s;o a conviction and an acknowlegement of the remedy in the circum|ci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, that is, by his blood. So bap|ti&s;m, by wa&s;hing, acknowleges native defilement, as well as the virtue of Chri&s;t's blood to clean&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, if we con&s;ider the&s;e ordinances as an obliging &s;ign, or bond of the covenant, there is an agreement here al&s;o.</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion laid Abraham and his children, under a bond to look &s;olely to Chri&s;t, and free grace, (the good contain'd in the covenant) for &s;alvation; and &s;trength to &s;erve God acceptably: which Abraham, and all the faithful in the jew|i&s;h
<PB N="39" REF="012076_0020_0F8993ECF3EA19A0">church, thro' grace did, as really as believers do now under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. And tho&s;e of the circumci&s;ed, who did not thus do, broke thro' a &s;trong bond, and their &s;in became aggra|vated, and without repentance, their puni&s;hment too, as the &s;criptures abundantly &s;hew.</P>
<P>So bapti&s;m may be con&s;idered as a bond, obli|ging the believer, and his &s;eed, to look &s;olely to Chri&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tification, for par|doning mercy and &s;anctifying grace; for &s;trength to &s;erve God acceptably here, and a glorious im|mortality hereafter. And if the children of be|lievers, under the bond of bapti&s;m, don't thro' grace, come up to tho&s;e obligations, both their &s;in and puni&s;hment will be dreadfully aggravat|ed; for the nigher any &s;tand related to God, and his gracious covenant, and the higher they are exalted, by their &s;ituation, with privileges, the lower they mu&s;t fall, and the deeper they mu&s;t &s;ink into hell, if they abu&s;e the &s;ame, and conti|nue impenitent.</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay there is an exact parrallel, in every thing, between circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m, nei|ther need there be, as the bapti&s;ts pretend there mu&s;t be, a parity throughout, in order to have them both &s;eals of the covenant of grace; but that is mere fallacy, or folly, as I could ea&s;ily &s;hew, were it not a needle&s;s wa&s;te of time. But there being a parity and agreement in the &s;pirit|ual mi&s;tery &s;ignified by both, in the main e&s;&s;en|tials thereof, it is entirely &s;ufficient. Doubtle&s;s there was &s;omething in circumci&s;ion typical of Chri&s;t and of his death, as yet to come, who was
<PB N="40" REF="012076_0021_0F8993EDB77A7420">to be born of the holy circumci&s;ed &s;eed of Abra|ham, and yet to be born of a woman, altho' the females were not circumci&s;ed, to &s;hew perhaps, while the bloody &s;ign was only to pa&s;s upon the males, that Chri&s;t alone was to &s;uffer for, and in the room of the church, his &s;pou&s;e; <HI>for of the people there was none with him.</HI> And perhaps this may be one rea&s;on why females were exempted from the painful and bloody &s;ign of the covenant under the typical di&s;pen&s;ation. But now under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t being over, the painful &s;eal cea&s;es, a mild &s;eal commences, and females are brought under it, this &s;ignifying, that altho' the &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t was not to &s;hare with him in the cur&s;e, yet &s;he is to &s;hare with him in the ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>III.|I come now to con&s;ider the new te&s;ta|ment interpretation of the jewi&s;h church, after the Sinai di&s;pen&s;ation, and the yoke of the cere|monial law, was laid upon them. The rites and ceremonies laid upon the jewi&s;h church, were very numerous; of which, as Paul &s;ays, I cannot now &s;peak particularly; but &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general, that that was a te&s;tament of blood. There was atoning blood, &s;prinkling blood, clean&s;ing blood. For &s;aith the apo&s;tle, Heb. 9.22. <HI>Al|mo&s;t all things are by the law purged with blood.</HI>&mdash; Now, altho' this ceremonial blood was weak in it&s;elf con&s;idered, and could not take away &s;in; yet it declared there was blood efficatious enough to do it, and it pointed them right to Chri&s;t and his blood, that does make an atonement to the full &s;atisfaction of divine ju&s;tice; and does purge the
<PB N="41" REF="012076_0021_0F8993EDB77A7420">con&s;cience, and clean&s;e from &s;in. And all tho&s;e then in the jewi&s;h church, who under&s;tood the true nature of the&s;e ceremonial in&s;titutions, and fell in with the de&s;ign of God therein, read the atonement of Chri&s;t's blood therein, and by faith fled thereunto for clean&s;ing and for &s;alvation.&mdash; And a bapti&s;t knows not what he &s;ays, nor where|of he affirms, when he a&s;&s;erts that that was a di&s;|pen&s;ation of the covenant of works, or denies it to be the covenant of grace. What, does the co|venant of works provide a Mediator for &s;inners? and point out the way of life by the Mediator's death? A &s;trange &s;ort of a covenant of works, that points the way of &s;alvation by free grace. But there are two things which I apprehend that the bapti&s;t do not rightly di&s;tingui&s;h, which proves the means of their mi&s;take here, and has led them to con&s;ider the Sinai-di&s;pen&s;ation a co|venant of works, upon which they &s;ay the jewi&s;h church was form'd, and not upon the covenant of grace.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I apprehend that the bapti&s;ts do not di&s;|tingui&s;h the covenant of grace, appearing in an external form of admini&s;tration, and, the internal efficacy on the heart. And therefore when they read of the legal &s;ervices, and &s;o many carnal or|dinances as they are called, enjoin'd upon the jewi&s;h church, they are ready to &s;ay, the&s;e can't belong to the covenant of grace, for that is effi|cacious to in&s;pire life into the &s;oul, or put the law of God into the heart.</P>
<P>Secondly, the bapti&s;ts don't di&s;tingui&s;h between the true nature and right improvement of the ce|remonial
<PB N="42" REF="012076_0022_0F8993EE727F5A58">in&s;titutions, and how the Jews in ge|neral did improve them. How they did improve them, and how they ought to have improved them are two things. They ought to have improved them &s;o as to have been led to Chri&s;t by them, and to have accepted of &s;alvation by free grace in the way of the new covenant: But they did, the body of them, &s;o improve the ceremonial in|&s;titutions as to make them a covenant of works to them&s;elves, and &s;o clave to that covenant.&mdash; And what was in the event, the bapti&s;t pretend was the intent of that di&s;pen&s;ation, viz. a coven|ant of works. But it is all a mi&s;take. What if one &s;hould &s;ay, that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation was a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of works, and &s;hould think to prove it by this, viz. that many profe&s;&s;ors under the go&s;pel &s;ub&s;titute the externals of go&s;pel duties, ordinances, rites and ceremonies; in&s;tead of Chri&s;t, and make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their pri|vileges &amp; doings, cleave to the covenant of works, and live and die under that covenant. I &s;ay, not|with&s;tanding this is a &s;ad and awful truth, doubt|le&s;s, with re&s;pect to many under the go&s;pel; yet will this prove that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation is a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of works? Doubtle&s;s bapti&s;ts and all will &s;ay no. And no better proof have they, that the typical di&s;pen&s;ation was a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of works.</P>
<P>But what I principally aim at, under this head, is, to con&s;ider briefly, that notwith&s;tanding all the legal &s;ervices, carnal ordinances and indeed car|nal men, in the jewi&s;h church, yet things were not, even then, &s;o altogether typical of &s;omething
<PB N="43" REF="012076_0022_0F8993EE727F5A58">future, concerning the covenant of grace, and the &s;piritual glory of the go&s;pel church, as to deny a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace, and a &s;pi|ritual church then exi&s;ting, altho' the glory there|of was comparatively low, &amp; vail'd with a type.</P>
<P>Let us hear then how the new te&s;tament con|&s;iders the jewi&s;h church under the ceremonial law. Gal. 4.1, 2.

But is under tutors and governors until the time appoin|ted of the father."</P>
<P>Now this pa&s;&s;age is, I know, by good divines, &s;ometimes applied to an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, before conver|&s;ion, as differing nothing from others, but is un|der the cur&s;e and &s;everity of the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law, or the broken covenant of works, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he is con|verted, and &s;o obtains freedom and deliverance from the cur&s;e thereof. But I dare &s;ay, this is not the principal meaning of Paul, nor the text. For by the heir, in the&s;e two different circum|&s;tances, Paul &s;peaks of; as fir&s;t under age, there to be tutor'd, and that with a good deal of &s;eve|rity, as if he was but only a &s;ervant, and not a child: And then coming forth out of that cir|cum&s;tance, into liberty and freedom, as a child does who has got to be of age&mdash;I &s;ay, by this heir, Paul means to point out the church of God in two different periods: The heir in minority, under tutors, &amp;c. repre&s;ents the church under the ceremonial law, which was very &s;evere: But the heir coming into freedom, no more to be under his former tutors and governors, repre&s;ents the
<PB N="44" REF="012076_0023_0F8993F00DD88288">church in the go&s;pel day, coming into go&s;pel liberty and freedom, and no more to come under that heavy yoke, the ceremonial law. And all who read Paul's epi&s;tle to the Galatians with un|der&s;tanding, and take the chain of his arguments, will &s;ee this to be the ca&s;e; yet I allow that the church under the go&s;pel, is favoured more emi|nently with internal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, and commences into a circum&s;tance more pure and &s;piritual than under the typical di&s;pen&s;ation. But then what I aim to remark from this new te&s;ta|ment interpretation of the church under the cere|monial law, is, that there was the exi&s;tance and being of a &s;piritual church, even then, (tho' not in the go&s;pel form) although the &s;piritual glory of it was comparatively low, and vail'd with a type. If this was not &s;o, Paul brought a very un&s;uitable &s;imilitude to repre&s;ent the ca&s;e by. A man, an heir, at liberty and freedom, had exi&s;t|ance and being, when but a child; and altho' now he throws away the habit he wore when he was a child, and bids adieu to his old &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who then learn'd him his letters, &amp; betakes him|&s;elf now to employment that more becomes a &s;tate of manhood; yet he is to be con&s;idered as one and the &s;ame per&s;on, in the&s;e two different cir|cum&s;tances, the latter of which is much to be preferred before the fir&s;t. So God con&s;idered his church as a child under age, and dealt with it accordingly under the typical di&s;pen&s;ation, and by types and &s;hadows did as it were, take the child by the hand, and lead it to the &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance. But at the time appointed of the father, viz. in
<PB N="45" REF="012076_0023_0F8993F00DD88288">the go&s;pel day, God con&s;iders his church more advan|ced in age, and ripene&s;s for freedom, and treats it ac|cordingly; which latter circum&s;tance of the church is much to be preferred to the former. But if the church was not under a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace, but form'd upon the covenant of works, as the bapti&s;ts pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end, nor to be con&s;idered in a degree &s;piritual, how could it then, with any propriety, be called a child and in the go&s;pel day advanced to manhood? When accor|ding to the bapti&s;ts, there were no advancement to it; but were to be con&s;idered as two di&s;tinct churches in their nature, the one in&s;tituted and con&s;tituted by God to be a carnal church in the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ign of it; the latter in|&s;tituted and con&s;tituted by God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be a &s;piritual church. And al&s;o according to the bapti&s;ts the&s;e two different churches are form'd upon two different covenants, which d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer in their nature and e&s;&s;ence, viz. that the jewi&s;h church was form'd upon the covenant of works, <HI>do and live.</HI> And the go&s;pel church only form'd upon the covenant of grace. And if this were the ca&s;e, it &s;eems Paul &s;hould have took &s;ome other &s;imilitude, and of different &s;pecies, the one &s;pecie to repre&s;ent the Jews church by, form'd upon the covenant of works; the o|ther &s;pecie to repre&s;ent the go&s;pel church by, form'd up|on the covenant of grace, viz &s;uch a &s;imilitude as this, That the ox or the hor&s;e was under tutors and govern|ors, but the child is free: yea, free as &s;oon as it was born; for according to the bapti&s;t, the true church never had exi&s;tance until the go&s;pel day.</P>
<P>IV. I am to con&s;ider the new te&s;tament inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">a|tion, and repre&s;entation of the breaking off of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from their church-&s;tate, and the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">afting in of the Gen|tiles. Now the apo&s;tle repre&s;ents this in the 11th cha. Rom. by the &s;imilitude of an <HI>olive tree, natural branches, and wild.</HI> By this olive tree, Paul means to repre&s;ent the Jews in their covenant relation to God; by the na|tural branches which were broken off, he means the Jews
<PB N="46" REF="012076_0024_0F8993F0B4233E88">who fell by unbelief, and forfeited their &s;tanding in co|venant relation to God, and in &s;everity God took the forfeiture at their hands, and rejected them. And by the olive tree, wild by nature, which was grafted in a|mong the natural branches that &s;tood, Paul means the Gentile church. From all which we may fairly and truly argue thus: That if the Gentiles, by being graf|ted in among the natural branches that were not broken off, do &s;tand related to God, as his church, by the ex|ternal admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; then the natural branches, be|fore they were broken off, did &s;tand related to God by the &s;ame covenant, altho' under a different di&s;pen&s;ation, or a different form of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Again, If &s;ome of the natural branches were not bro|ken off by unbelief, but by faith kept their &s;tanding in covenant relation to God, and this &s;tanding in cove|nant relation to God, in the go&s;pel day, is a &s;tanding in relation to God as his church and covenant peo|ple, by, and according to the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation: Then the natural branches did before, &s;tand related to God by the external admini&s;tration of the &s;ame coven|ant of grace, altho' under a different di&s;pen&s;ation of it. What &s;en&s;e would there be in &s;aying, that when the Gentiles came to be taken into a covenant relation to God, even by the covenant of grace, that they were grafted in, if the Jews had not &s;tood in relation to God by the &s;ame covenant? but another covenant e&s;&s;entially different. Do you think, &s;ir, that the Gentile church is grafted into the covenant of works? and &s;tand in rela|tion to God by a di&s;pen&s;ation of that covenant? Or do you &s;uppo&s;e the Gentile church is grafted in to a cove|nant relation to God, by a covenant that is merely nati|onal, that does not mean, nor carry &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in the promi&s;e of it? Yes, you mu&s;t hold to this abomi|nable ab&s;urdity; or el&s;e make Paul talk non-&s;en&s;e; or give up your a&s;&s;ertion wherein you deny Abraham's
<PB N="47" REF="012076_0024_0F8993F0B4233E88">covenant to be the covenant of grace, and deny the jewi&s;h church to &s;tand related to God by a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace. According to the bapti&s;ts. Paul &s;hould not have &s;aid <HI>broken off, and grafted in;</HI> for when he &s;ays, &s;ome of the natural branches were broken off, it fully implies that there yet remained the &s;tump, &s;tock, and &s;ome of the natural branches which were con|tinued along, and the Gentiles by ingrafting, come in upon that root. And hence &s;ays Paul to the Gentile church, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t not, for thou beare&s;t not the root, but the root thee.</HI> Now by this roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;tock, and branches which were continued, can't po&s;&s;ibly mean the typical or cere|monial di&s;pen&s;ation; for that had waxed old, and was vani&s;hed away; therefore it was the e&s;&s;ence of the co|venant relation it &s;elf, that did not change with the change of di&s;pen&s;ations. But as I &s;aid, according to the bapti&s;t notion, Paul &s;hould not have &s;aid, Some of the branches were broken off, and the Gentiles grafted in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but that all the branches, &s;tock, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> root, and all &s;unk together, and a new &s;tock and branches aro&s;e, e&s;&s;entially different. For if the church under the ceremonial law, was not under a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace, and the go&s;pel church is, there can be no ingraftment in the ca&s;e, but two di&s;tinct things.</P>
<P>But that we may learn further, what the breaking off the Jews, and the grafting in of the Gentiles meant, &amp; intended, the parable of the vineyard, Mat. 21. may afford us &s;ome light. None will deny, I &s;uppo&s;e, but that the vineyard repre&s;ented and meant the jewi&s;h church-&s;tate, with the privileges thereof, which they fadly and wickedly abu&s;ed, as you may &s;ee at large in the parable, as Chri&s;t there repre&s;ents and &s;ets it forth. Then Chri&s;t demanded of his hearers, what they thought the lord of the vineyard would do to tho&s;e wicked hu&s;|bandmen? They an&s;wer, <HI>mi&s;erably de&s;troy them, and let out the vineyard to other hu&s;bandmen, which &s;hall render him the fruits in their &s;ea&s;on.</HI> Now it &s;eems that Chri&s;t ap|proved
<PB N="48" REF="012076_0025_0F8993F173E52030">of their an&s;wer, for he further adds and &s;ays; <HI>The kingdom of God &s;hall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</HI> Now by the king|dom of God here, it is evident that the &s;ame thing is meant that the vineyard repre&s;ented, which as I noted before was the jewi&s;h church-&s;tate, with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s privileges; and &s;ays Chri&s;t, it &s;hall be giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to a nation bringing forth, the frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s thereof; referring to the Gentile nation, who was about to receive the go&s;pel, and thro' grace, did bring forth, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an&s;werable fruit. But now ob&s;erve here, that it was the &s;ame vineyard, the &s;ame kingdom of God, which was taken from the Jews, that Chri&s;t &s;ays &s;hould be given to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Gentiles; that is, it mu&s;t mean a relation to God by the &s;ame covenant, viz the covenant of grace, although not under the &s;ame di&s;pen&s;ation of it.</P>
<P>But it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ems that if you had been to have explain'd, or repre&s;ented this matter, your principles would not allowed you to have explained it ju&s;t as Chri&s;t has done. But your principles would have nece&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated you to re|pre&s;ent the matter &s;ome how after this manner, viz. <Q>That the jewi&s;h church, by a certain covenant relation they &s;tood in to God, di&s;tinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, had certain favours and privileges granted to them, which might be compared to a vine|yard let out, the fruits of which they were bound to return in due &s;ea&s;on; but for their unfaithfulne&s;s and unfruitfulne&s;s, God in righteou&s;ne&s;s determined he would take the vineyard from them. And what will he do with it? Will he give it to the Gentiles, and try them whether they will render an&s;werable fruit? No, but God will take away the vineyard from the Jews. and give the Gentiles another e&s;&s;entially d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ferent, and a thou&s;and times better in its nature.</Q></P>
<P>For certainly, if the jewi&s;h church did not &s;tand re|lated to God by a di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but if they were form'd or con&s;tituted upon a di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;a|tion

But Chri&s;t &s;ays, the &s;ame vineyard, the &s;ame kingdom of God, &s;hall be taken from the Jews, and given to the Gentiles; and who mu&s;t I believe? when Chri&s;t &s;ays it is the &s;ame, I think it it &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t to credit him, let the bapti&s;ts &s;ay otherwi&s;e ever &s;o peremptorily.</P>
<P>But I think enough has been &s;aid under the&s;e four foregoing heads, to &s;hew, that what you charge us with is not true, viz. That we do not con&s;true and interpret the new te&s;tament by the old, in order to &s;upport infant bapti&s;m: But contrarily, we adhere to the new te&s;ta|ment interpretation of the old, and hence find a warrant for the practice. For from what has been &s;aid above, we may, I think, remark the&s;e following things, as grounded and e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the new te&s;tament te&s;ti|mony, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the covenant with Abraham was the coven|ant of grace, containing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, Gal. 3.17. Luk. 1.72,&mdash;75.</P>

Rom. 9.3. Mat. 8.12.</P>
<P N="4">4. That to &s;tand thus related to God by covenant, even by the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, and brought under the &s;eal and bond thereof, is con&s;idered as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy, great favour, pri|vilege and benefit, Rom. 3.1, 2.

<P N="5"><PB N="50" REF="012076_0026_0F8993F232B264C0">
5. That the Gentile church is grafted in to the &s;ame covenant relation to God; that is, related to God by the &s;ame covenant of grace, as the jewi&s;h church once &s;tood in, altho' under a more glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of the one &amp; the &s;ame covenant, and are come under the promi&s;e and ble&s;&s;ings of it, &s;o that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is come on the believing Gentiles; to whom God &s;aid, thro' the promi&s;ed &s;eed, <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> as the language and tenor of his gracious covenant; by virtue of which gracious promi&s;e, Abraham did claim &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to his own &s;oul, and a place for his children, in God's vi&s;ible kingdom, and under the bond and &s;eal of God's covenant, Rom. 10 17.

<P>But that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is come on the be|lieving Gentiles, and by their relation to God by the &s;ame covenant, they may claim the good of the promi&s;e, which is the &s;ame &s;till, <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> the new te&s;tament will help us to &s;ome further confirm|ation re&s;pecting this: For we do find in the new te&s;ta|ment, that where one of the parents is a believer, the fe|deral holine&s;s of the children is a&s;&s;erted.&mdash;By God's gracious covenant with the believer, <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</HI> where there is one parent thus related to God, and his gracious promi&s;e, the wickedne&s;s of the other can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make null the promi&s;e; for the children are con&s;idered as &s;tanding in relation to the believing par|ent, and holds that relation, to that parent and God's gracious covenant, as much as if the other parent had no being. 1 Cor. 7.14. <HI>El&s;e were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI>&mdash;As for your bapti&s;t nau&s;eous inter|pretation of the word <HI>holy,</HI> here in this place, <HI>that it means the children are not ba&s;tards,</HI> I don't think it worth while to &s;pend time to make a reply to it, &s;eeing it is &s;o mean a plea, to get by the force of our arguments, and &s;uffi|ciently confuted many a time already: only this I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that it &s;eems to be evident, by the drift and &s;cope of the apo&s;tle's argument, that <HI>that</HI> holine&s;s he there &s;poke of, was in con&s;equence of one of the parent's being a believer.</P>

Furthermore, the new te&s;tament confirms our opinion, becau&s;e it &s;peaks of, and holds forth hou&s;hold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bapti&s;m. 1 Cor. 1.16 Acts 16 15.

But if we con&s;ider believing Noah taking his family into the ark, and thereby gives them a figurative &s;alvation, that is, in&s;trumentally by him, and upon his account they had it, and hereby, and herewith, he taught them, (for he was a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s) what was nece&s;&s;ary to their eternal &s;alvation.

<P>Agreeable hereunto we find that upon the conver&s;ion of the head of a family, the hou&s;hold was bapti&s;ed, Acts 16 15.33. 1 Cor. 1.16. And altho' there is no mention made of infants, yet hou&s;holds do include infants, and that is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Perhaps, &s;ir, you will &s;ay, that if I intended to write upon this controver&s;y, I ought to have taken the bap|ti&s;ts arguments in cour&s;e, and an&s;wered them in their order particularly. To which I an&s;wer, in a few parti|culars, as,</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Objection,</HI> That to bapti&s;e infants makes them members of the church, and gives them a right to the Lord's-&s;upper, as circumci&s;ion gave a right to the pa&s;|&s;over; for if infants have a right to one &s;eal, they mu&s;t to the other; for capti&s;m is as &s;acred an ordinance as the Lord's-&s;upper; and if they have a right to both, this is
<PB N="54" REF="012076_0028_0F8993F3B2AE1B18">to build the church with unconverted men, as &s;uch, which is contrary to the general language of the new te&s;tament,</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. I acknowlege that &s;ome who hold to, and practice infant bapti&s;m, do improve it according to the objection above, and &s;uppo&s;e that the infant bapti&s;ed has a right to the Lord's-&s;upper, without any true grace, or the profe&s;&s;on of any. But I &s;uppo&s;e it to be an abu&s;e and wrong improvement of the doctrine and practice of in|fant bapti&s;m. But &s;hall we reject infant bapti&s;m for that? If we reject every thing that has been abu&s;ed, we mu&s;t reject the whole bible.</P>
<P N="2">2. The objection, or objector, don't di&s;tingui&s;h what kind of right, nor in what manner, the believer's infant has a right to bapti&s;m. The child of a believer has not a right to bapti&s;m by per&s;onal qualifications, but relative? that is, &s;tanding &s;o related to his believing parent: be|cau&s;e that God in his gracious and &s;overeign plea&s;ure, was plea&s;ed &s;o to couple the believer and his child to|gether in this matter, that in the External admini&s;tra|tion of the Covenant of grace, one &s;eal &s;hould be ap|plied to both parent and Child. And I&s;hmael, tho' a wicked Child, and turn'd out wicked in the end, yet had the &s;ame relative qualification that I&s;aac had; that is, he &s;tood &s;o related to his godly Father, that by God's gracious Covenant, it became Abraham's duty, and I&s;hmael's priviledge, to have the &s;eal of Gods covenant, and the parent's faith, applied to the Child. But I&s;h|mael abu&s;ing his prilviledges, growing profane and wicked, and not having, nor producing the per&s;onal qua|lifications requi&s;ite for a continuance in God's church, even under that (comparatively) dark di&s;pen&s;ation, was rejected, and purged out. So the children of believers, being baptized, or having the &s;eal of God's gracious covenant applied to them, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, 'tis upon their relative qualification, and their right comes by their parents, or parent; God's covenant be|ing
<PB N="55" REF="012076_0028_0F8993F3B2AE1B18">&s;till the &s;ame, with the believer, <HI>thou and thy &s;eed.</HI> But now if the&s;e bapti&s;ed children come to the Lord's-table, they are the actors, and not their parents; and coming upon their own per&s;o|nal right, they mu&s;t have the per&s;onal qualificati|ons requi&s;ite; and the new te&s;tament &s;hews what they be, and in&s;i&s;ts much upon them; as faith and repentance, or in a word, the <HI>truth of grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I remark a mi&s;take in the above objection. When the bapti&s;t perceive, we hold with them, that true grace is requi&s;ite in order to come to the Lord's-&s;upper, with the divine approbation, they &s;eem to triumph in bringing this objection again&s;t us, viz. That we pretend to hold infant bapti&s;m, from circumci&s;ion, and yet won't let them come to the Lord's-&s;upper upon that; whereas circum|ci&s;ion, &s;ay they, gave the I&s;raelites a right to the pa&s;&s;over. But here is &s;ome mi&s;take, and the bap|ti&s;t &s;eem to be quite willing to join with the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stoddardeans&mdash;By, this phra&s;e I mean not to reflect upon the memory of the venerable Stoddard.

But I apprehend two armies again&s;t the truth, will ne|ver overthrow it; e&s;pecially when both are in|volved in one mi&s;take. The mi&s;take is this; they
<PB N="56" REF="012076_0029_0F8993F47550C5F0">&s;ay that circumci&s;ion gave the I&s;raelites a right to the pa&s;&s;over; whereas I find there was a concur|rence of other things and circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary, in order to attend the pa&s;&s;over with the divine approbation. Look in Gen. 12. where the pa&s;&s;over was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and there we find per&s;onal directions how &amp; after what manner the pa&s;&s;over ought to be attended. They were to eat the pa&s;&s;|over with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, to denote that repentance accompanies faith: That tho&s;e who feed on Chri&s;t, the Lamb of God by faith, do it with bitter repentance for &s;in. So there were per&s;onal directions further, they were to eat the pa&s;&s;over with their loins girded, &s;hoes on their feet, and their &s;taves in their hands; and was this to &s;hew that they were circumci&s;ed? No, but to &s;hew that they were per&s;onally, and actually in a marching po&s;ture from Egypt to Ca|naan, and that the power and &s;trength of Egypt, that night was broke. And afterwards they never were to eat the pa&s;&s;over but in the circum&s;tance of being found ceremonially clean; as well as to be circumci&s;ed. Circumci&s;ion was a duty previ|ous to the eating of the pa&s;&s;over, I allow; and &s;o is bapti&s;m previous to the Lord's-&s;upper, and re|qui&s;ite in order thereunto, but I can't allow it qualifies therefor, but where there is the concur|rence of other things, viz. tho&s;e per&s;onal qualifi|cations the go&s;pel requires; when any can come and feed on Chri&s;t the Lamb of God, with that faith which true repentance attends, and &s;hew that they are in a marching po&s;ture to the hea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly Canaan, and their native bondage to &s;in and

And yet if I form my opinion upon the bapti&s;ts repre&s;entation of things I mu&s;t conclude that form|erly God was &s;olax &amp; indifferent, that he required, and was content with only ceremonial holine&s;s; but now is grown &s;o &s;evere that he requires, and nothing le&s;s will content him, than real holine&s;s in his people.</P>
<P>But while I attend to the&s;e things, I find I am led where I am be&s;et on both &s;ides with objecti|ons, and need the two edged &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of God, that will cut both ways, and make the path of truth appear, notwith&s;tand|&s;tanding the attempts to block it up with objec|tions; and tru&s;ting I have the &s;ame at hand, I &s;hall make a reply here both ways, And</P>
<P N="1">1. To a Stoddardean objection, which is, that we have no right to keep a bapti&s;ed per&s;on from the Lord's-&s;upper, if he be outwardly moral, al|tho' he has no true grace, nor &s;o much as profe&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the other hand the bapti&s;ts &s;ay, it does the child no good to bapti&s;e it before it has faith, this don't enable it to believe, nor &s;ecure it &s;alva|tion, and therefore it is no benefit at all.</P>
<P>Now both the&s;e objections ari&s;e from one root, however different the aims and character of the
<PB N="58" REF="012076_0030_0F8993F53471DF70">parties may be who make them, viz. from this they both ari&s;e, <HI>a &s;ecret kind of taking it for gran|ted that it is not a per&s;on's &s;in, even under the light of the go&s;pel, that he don't truly believe in Chri&s;t, or become converted.</HI> Now if this &s;uppo&s;ition were true the objections might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome grounds to &s;tand upon, but it being fal&s;e, the ob|jections are only like ca&s;tles in the air.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall reply to the Stoddardean objection. And as I remark'd before, one who comes to the Lord's-&s;upper, as it is a per&s;onal act, &s;o the agent mu&s;t come upon his per&s;onal right, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the per&s;onal qualifi|cations required, which I think is not merely in|fant bapti&s;m, nor an outward moral life, but true faith. And as this might be proved from the new te&s;tament in general, &s;o from the 11th. ch. of Rom. in particular. Paul is here &s;peaking of the Jews who were broken off from their church-&s;tate by unbelief, and the Gentile church, who was grafted in by faith. Now the unbelief of the Jews who were broken off, and the faith of the Gentiles who were grafted in, are oppo&s;ed to each other. But the unbelief of the Jews was damning, therefore the faith of the Gentiles was &s;aving. And without any departure, or di&s;tinc|tion from this kind of faith by which the Gentile church at fir&s;t was grafted in, Paul tells them they mu&s;t &s;tand. <HI>Thou</HI> (O Gentile church) <HI>&s;tand|eth by faith.</HI> But what does Paul mean by &s;tand|ing? Why in continuance; as his own words explain, Be not high-minded but fear; for if God &s;pared not the natural branches, viz. the Jews,
<PB N="59" REF="012076_0030_0F8993F53471DF70">take heed le&s;t h&eacute; &s;pare not you. So that the Gentile church is to &s;tand in continuance in that relation to God as his church, by <HI>&s;aith,</HI> and not by bapti&s;m in infancy and outward morality merely, as the Stoddardean prin|ciple pleads they may. But if the natural &s;eed of be|lievers, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other children, by God's &s;overeign appointment, and their parent's act, and brought under the bond and &s;eal of God's coven|ant, and hereby into an external nearne&s;s to God, and laid under additional obligations to repent of &s;in, believe in Chri&s;t, choo&s;e God for their only portion, and un|feignedly to dedicate them&s;elves to him, even for time and eternity: I &s;ay, if they refu&s;e to do this, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, and continue in po&s;&s;itive damning unbe|lief, refu&s;ing Chri&s;t, &amp; a cordial compliance with the go&s;|pel; they not only judge them&s;elves unworthy of eter|nal life, but hereby render them&s;elves unworthy of a continuance in God's vi&s;ible church in the go&s;pel day, which is to &s;tand in continuance, by &s;aith; therefore &s;uch mu&s;t go out like a wicked I&s;hmael, and a profane E&s;au, who &s;old his birth-right; and the blame mu&s;t lie upon them&s;elves, and not upon God, who appoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s rules, nor upon his church who attends to them. But O! is not this hard? I an&s;wer, That if impenitency and un|belief in the&s;e circum&s;tances, was only their calamity &amp; not their &s;in, it would be hard indeed: but if unbelief is their &s;in, and the greate&s;t of &s;ins, in the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces. I don't know who would think this hard, that won't think damnation harder, to be inflicted for the &s;ame &s;in.</P>
<P>But a Stoddardean, upon the principle, will &s;ay, no, it is unrea&s;onable that a bapti&s;ed child &s;hould go out of God's vi&s;ible church, &amp; his &s;eed with him, &amp; to become heathen, for the want of true faith; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> let one who was bapti&s;ed in infancy, do as well as he can when he becomes adult, without the grace of true faith. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hall pre&s;erve to him&s;elf and his po&s;terity a &s;tanding in the church of God: that is, let him profe&s;s his &s;peculative

Therefore I &s;uppo&s;e one breathing out the very &s;pirit of the Stoddardean principle, may addre&s;s him&s;elf to a bapti&s;ed child, now grown to adult years, and has children of his own, after this manner; <Q>O! to my grief and &s;orrow, I find that there is &s;ome &s;uch cruel mini&s;ters and churches in the land, who would &s;ain be &s;o &s;evere to per&s;ons in your circum&s;tances, as to hold you off from the Lord's-table, and deny you bapti&s;m for your children, and cau&s;e that you, at lea&s;t that your children become heathen, becau&s;e you han't that &s;pecial grace of faith, belonging, and peculiar to regenerate men; when notwith&s;tanding you are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many amiable qualities and virtues. I &s;ee you have a good conver&s;ation, a civil and moral life; and you hold to orthodox principles, and are ready to profe&s;s your &s;peculative &s;aith and moral &s;in|cerity, and willingne&s;s, on this wi&s;e, to come under covenant engagements to &s;erve God for the future, as far as by his grace he &s;hall enable you. God forbid that his mini&s;ters and churches &s;hould deny you and your children ordinances, and a continuance in the church upon &s;uch an upright profe&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>And thus the principle &s;ooths up, and flatters the un|believer, as tho' it was not his &s;in that he don't truly believe, provided he is willing to come forward in the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of the externals of religion. But I don't find that the go&s;pel thus paliates the &s;oul-dam|ning &s;in of unbelief, neither will it compound matters with the unbeliever, and accept of other things, in the liou of true faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. And from the &s;ame root, as I &s;aid, as &s;uppo&s;ing that unbelief is not much of a &s;in, if any, does the bapti&s;t objection ari&s;e when they &s;ay, it does the child of a believer no good to bapti&s;e it before it has &s;aith, for bapti&s;m don't &s;ecure &s;alvation to the child, nor enable it to believe, &amp;c. To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="012076_0031_0F8993F5F2FE94A8">
The que&s;tion is not whether bapti&s;m &s;ecures the &s;al|vation of the child of a believer, not whether it enables the child to believe. But the que&s;tion is whether the child is not hereby bro't under an additional obligation to believe and repent; and whether thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> additional ob|ligation thus to do, is not a great privilege, and of the nature of a mercy: and this is what I a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt. But if im|penitency and unbelief is not the &s;in of every man who enjoys the light of the go&s;pel, and continues therein, then the obligation to believe and repent can't be more bin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in one circum&s;tance than another: and the bap|ti&s;ed child of a true believer, who by God's appoint|ment and the parent's act, is brought under the bond &amp; &s;eal of the covenant, is not additionally bound to believe and repent. But if it be a duty to believe and repent truly and &s;avingly, then the obligation to perform this duty may admit of degrees, and the highe&s;t degree the greate&s;t mercy. And God has a &s;overeing right to fa|vour &s;ome with a greater obligation laid upon them to believe and repent, than others. As for in&s;tance: A child born and bro't up in a land of go&s;pel light, is un|der a greater obligation to love, fear, and &s;erve God, than one born and brought up in a land of heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s. And this obligation is a great mercy &amp; pri|vilege, as all will allow; and be&s;towed in a way of &s;o|vereignty; for he came into being and exi&s;tance in this &s;ituation, without any planning or contrivance of his own; and here he is bound. O ble&s;&s;ed bond! the &s;tronger the better; but if broken, the condemnation will be the greater. And what hinders but that there may be higher degrees of obligations laid upon &s;ome child|ren in way of &s;overeignty than what I have mentioned? even by God's appointment to be born in a greater ex|ternal nearne&s;s to him, than barely in a land of go&s;pel light; to &s;tand &s;o related to God, &amp; his church, as that by the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, to be placed under the bond and &s;eal of it? Who dare
<PB N="62" REF="012076_0032_0F8993F6B357EFA8">&s;ay this is not a mercy and privilege? or that there is no additional bonds to God in this &s;tanding? Although thro' the &s;in of unbelief, many times, the privileges are mi&s;improved, &amp; the obligations with all their &s;trength are broken, and the children of the kingdom, in this &s;en&s;e, are finally ca&s;t out and rejected of God; but they could not be ca&s;t out of God's kingdom, if they had not had, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a &s;tanding in it.</P>
<P>If men are not, and cannot be laid under obligations to believe and repent truly then I allow that the obliga|tion cannot be increa&s;ed by difference of circum&s;tances; and for the children of believers to be included in the external admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace, and to be bapti&s;ed in infancy, does them no good. But I tru&s;t that thro' grace. I never &s;hall be left to embrace &s;uch corrupt
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here, &s;ir, I would ju&s;t put you in mind, that your great and celebrated Dr. Gill, who&s;e writings you recommend &s;o much, with all his eminency and greatne&s;s, has made a great mi&s;take in a very ma|terial point in divinity. I mention it becau&s;e there are many in the land who &s;wallow down &s;uch divinity as &s;ound and good.&mdash;Some years ago, I read a pamphlet with a pre&s;ace by Dr. Gill, who recom|mended the book as good, and the divinity as &s;ound; but when I came to read it, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that Dr. Gill &s;hould recom|mend &s;uch &s;tuff as good divinity. Now the author's name I have forgot, but the divinity of it (if it will do to call it by that name) I well remember. The author, &s;peaking of the final condemnation of the wicked, who peri&s;h from under the light of the go&s;pel, &s;aid, they would not be condemned becau&s;e they did not <HI>believe</HI> truly, or exer|ci&s;e &s;aving faith, and repent evangelically: but they would be con|demned becau&s;e they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d not improve their hi&s;torical faith, or &s;pecu|lative faith, in a better manner. And the weak grounds he thought to &s;upport it upon, was this, that true faith, and true repentance, are the &s;pecial gift of God, and therefore &s;eem'd to think it could not be their &s;in not to exerci&s;e the&s;e graces, unle&s;s God had actually fir&s;t be|&s;towed them upon the &s;inner. But this divinity and argument would excu&s;e the devil in hell, and the wickede&s;t man on earth, from any blame for not loving God with all their hearts. For love to God is as much the &s;pecial gift of God to a &s;inner, as faith and repentance is; and if God don't give this &s;pecial gift of love to him&s;elf, to the &s;inner, he mu&s;t excu&s;e the &s;inner from blame and puni&s;hment, according to this argument, if the &s;inner don't love God; altho' if the &s;inner don't make as good an improvement of his common grace as he can, con|&s;i&s;tent: with his reigning enmity, he &s;hall be damned for that.&mdash;In a word, it &s;eems by &s;uch divinity, that all proper ideas of man's moral obligations to perfect holine&s;s, is entirely lo&s;t; for what is the exerci&s;e of true faith, and evangelical repentance, but particular branches of holine&s;s? and &s;uch branches of it too, as &s;hews that the &s;ubject thereof is greatly wanting as to the degree of holine&s;s, which the moral obli|gations he is under, binds him unto.</NOTE> divinity.</P>

I have known &s;ome bapti&s;ts, the ranke&s;t &s;ort of Arminians, but I never thought of fathering arminiani&s;m upon the bap|ti&s;ts principles, but upon another cau&s;e, viz. <HI>The corrup|tion of humane nature, together with &s;atan's influence.</HI></P>
<P>Again, on the other hand, there are &s;ome, not to &s;ay many, that go by the denomination of bapti&s;t, who were dipt deeper in the antinomian &s;pirit than ever they were in the water; and from thence growing expert in &s;ling|ing out their invectives, again&s;t Babylon, anti-chri&s;t &amp; tradition, without making any proper di&s;tinctions; cal|ling every thing to be &s;uch that don't fellow&s;hip them in their antinomian travel, they commence very &s;pirit|ual chri&s;tians in their own op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nion; and are for a reli|gion ju&s;t like their own minds, which is without form and void. Doctrional religion, and preaching the ter|rors
<PB N="65" REF="012076_0033_0F8993F84FC5B458">of the law, with them is reproached as legal; and to preach up conviction, conver&s;ion, chri&s;tian experience and a growing conformity to God, in the work of &s;anc|tification, with them is termed old fa&s;hion religion, that u&s;ed to be in vogue when religion run low. They are after higher things, and more glorious, in their own view, than merely increa&s;e of holine&s;s, growth in &s;anc|tification, and greater and greater conformity to God, viz. the travel of Zion according to the work and wit|ne&s;s of God in the &s;pirit, as having out grown, and left all creeds, articles of faith, principles, and written church-covenants as merely a dead letter, belonging to anti-chri&s;t's kingdom. And hence they are always a building, &amp; always a breaking: always upon the theme of union, and yet always contending; always right, and yet always altering; always in &s;ome glorious travel, but never get along (in the right way) a &s;tep. Now if I &s;hould mea&s;ure the bapti&s;t principles and people, all off in a lump, by the principles and practices of the&s;e &s;ort of bapti&s;ts I have above mentioned, you would, I doubt not, think it was unfair dealing; and yet, it would be doing but as you have done, while you charge it upon the principle, and all who hold and practice infant bap|ti&s;m, of crying peace, peace to our children, as if &s;afe enough, when we have once bapti&s;ed them. Whereas this &s;ugge&s;tion is a vile and wicked &s;lander, let the man be ever &s;o good from whom is came. For when, thro' grace, we act up to our principles, we are &s;o far from crying peace, peace to our bapti&s;ed children, that we cry wrath! wrath! the heavie&s;t end of the divine wrath will enevitably fall upon them, if they go on in &s;in, and remain impenitent, &s;eeing God has exalted them &s;o high in point of privileges.</P>
<P N="2">2. I remark, that with a good deal of &s;atire and elo|quence, (not to &s;ay in&s;ult) you attempt to reproach Mr. F. and all in general who have wrote in favour of infant bapti&s;m, that they u&s;e great ambiguity of words in this
<PB N="66" REF="012076_0034_0F8993F8F3D47A78">controver&s;y; &s;o that their ways, like the harlots, are <HI>moveable that one cannot know them</HI>&mdash;But in &s;o doing, you bring to my mind the apo&s;tle's &s;evere reprimand, Rom. 2 11 <HI>Thou therefore which teache&s;t another, teach|e&s;t thou not thy &s;elf? thou that preache&s;t a man &s;hould not &s;teal, do&s;t thou &s;teal?</HI> v. 1. <HI>Wherein thou judge&s;t another, thou condemne&s;t thy &s;elf; for thou that judge&s;t doth the &s;ame things.</HI> Yea, the very &s;ame that thou charge&s;t them of doing. It is really marvellous to &s;ee with what ambi|guity you expre&s;s your&s;elf; a little hint by way of &s;pe|cimen, I will here ju&s;t drop. When you are denying the covenant with Abraham to be the covenant of grace, you &s;ay, <HI>the letter of it was do and live.</HI> Now I would a&s;k whether you mean by this, that the letter of Abra|ham's covenant contradicted the true nature and &s;pirit of it? if you don't, then I would a&s;k again, Whether you really mean, that Abraham's covenant, which you &s;ay was <HI>do and live,</HI> was an Adam's covenant of works, which required perfect doing, as a condition of life? Now if you meant thus, it would &s;o unavoidably in|volve you into &s;uch ab&s;urdities that I don't know how to think you really meant &s;o. Therefore you have hid your meaning under ambiguous terms, unle&s;s you meant to u&s;e ambiguity upon de&s;ign, which to me is very pro|bable. So again, &s;peaking of Abraham's covenant, you u&s;e tho&s;e &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions where God told Abraham, when he had enjoin'd circumci&s;ion upon him, <HI>And my covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h.</HI> But you u&s;e them &s;o ambi|guou&s;ly that you don't di&s;tingui&s;h whether you mean, as the &s;cripture explains, that the token of God's cove|nant &s;hould be in their fle&s;h, or the e&s;&s;ence of the cove|nant; but the latter of which, with ambiguity of words you attempt to in&s;inuate. So &s;ometimes you &s;eem to repre&s;ent Abraham's covenant to be neither the coven|ant of works nor the covenant of grace; at other times almo&s;t conceed that it was the covenant of grace: But your words are &s;o ambiguous, and ways &s;o moveable, that I cannot know them.</P>

3. I would remark a word or two upon the general vein, and &s;train of your writings upon this &s;ubject. And truly, &s;urpri&s;ing it might well &s;eem, to a chri&s;tian and catholic mind, to ob&s;erve how that your principles con|tract and narrow up, with &s;uch rigid &s;uper&s;tition, a mind, which otherwi&s;e might be con&s;idered as noble, excellent, and prai&s;e-worthy. Placing the very offence of bapti&s;m in being put wholly under water; of which I &s;hall not make any particular reply in this letter, for it has alrea|dy &s;welled in my hands much beyond my fir&s;t intention, neither do I look upon the <HI>mode</HI> &s;o material, as the <HI>&s;ub|jects</HI> of bapti&s;m.&mdash;You write with &s;uch peremptory airs of boa&s;t, as being, by way of eminence, in the cau&s;e of God, while you are &s;etting your&s;elf again&s;t infant bap|ti&s;m, and triumph &s;o much in the &s;uppo&s;ed clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s of proof, and fullne&s;s of demon&s;tration for your &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the que&s;tion; with &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the weakne&s;s, or wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e on the other &s;ide; that I &s;hould be apt to think, as the &s;aying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, if a man was to drop out of the clouds, wholly ignorant of the &s;criptures in general, and this controver&s;y in particular, and was to read your an&s;wer to Mr F's letter, and to form up a judgment by your repre&s;entation of things there, he would go nigh to think that there was no man of &s;en&s;e, under&s;tanding nor con&s;cience in favour of infant bap|ti&s;m. And it &s;eems by the &s;pirit of your writings, that you mean to in&s;inuate and impo&s;e this notion on the ig|norant and credulous, that as fa&s;t as any come to act hone&s;tly for the truth of reformation, and the cau&s;e of God, they come into your &s;entiments and practice in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things. And it &s;eems as if you was ready to con|clude, that what Job &s;aid once &s;atirically concerning his three friends, ought to be applied to you and your par|ty, in &s;ober &s;incerity. <HI>Doubtle&s;s ye are the people, and wi&s;dom &s;hall die with you.</HI> But I query in this ca&s;e, what would be the harm, and wherein the impropriety? if we &s;hould repeat Job's words here, which his friends ex|torted
<PB N="68" REF="012076_0035_0F8993F9B78155D8">from him by their cen&s;orious charge they bro't again&s;t him. <HI>What know ye that we know not al&s;o, and wherein are we inferior to you?</HI> Or to allude to the words of the apo&s;tle.

<P>I have ob&s;erved, &s;ir, that with other things in your public writings, you have wrote, three or four times at lea&s;t, in the vindication of your peculiar, bapti&s;t prin|ciples, and never have yet had, as I have known, or heard of any particular antagoni&s;t, in tho&s;e points, that has appeared to write again&s;t you. And it &s;eems that you began to think that the day was your own, that you had &s;top'd every bodies mouth, or at lea&s;t had &s;truck all with &s;uch intimidating fear, that there was not one &s;tripting left who dare encounter with this great Goli|ah, that has been the&s;e &s;everal times, defying one branch of the army of the living God, viz. the little children of his gracious covenant, and vi&s;ible kingdom.&mdash;And it &s;eems you have lifted your &s;ails rather too high&mdash;Be|gan to triumph before you h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d taken the field&mdash;At|tempted to divide the &s;poil, before you had won the battle.&mdash;Infant bapti&s;m is not given up yet&mdash;neither is it a going to be by the church of God in general, not|with&s;tanding there be the&s;e, here and there, (and &s;ome of them very judicious chri&s;tians in other re&s;pects, yet in this particular, one and all of them, I apprehend, may ju&s;tly be term'd, near &s;ighted people) who &s;tick in|the latter and are not able to penetrate through the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of the typical di&s;pen&s;ation; I &s;ay, in&s;ant bapti&s;m is but a going to be given up, altho' &s;uch there are, rea|dy enough to boa&s;t of their number under water.

I &s;ay, &s;uch will &s;ee a &s;olid foundation and &s;cripture warrant for infant bapti&s;m, and feel firm and &s;table in the point, altogether unmoved, as having firm ground to &s;tand upon, even in &s;haking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes; while others who built th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r infant bapti&s;m upon the quick|&s;and and quag-mire of humane tradition and cu&s;tom only, in &s;haking times, no wonder if they feel their foundation give way, and they &s;ink and are plunged.</P>
<P>As God has united all true believers with Abraham, in the ble&s;&s;ings of the one and &s;ame covenant, &s;o all &s;uch as have their under&s;tandings fruitful herein, will unite with Abraham, not only in acknowledging the ble&s;|&s;ings thereof as it re&s;pects them&s;elves per&s;onally, but their &s;eed al&s;o. While others who are wanting in fruitful|ne&s;s of knowlege and under&s;tanding herein; altho' they profe&s;s to be the children of Abraham, yet in this point will not do the works of Abraham, but deny the &s;eal of God's gracious covenant to their children, <HI>this did not Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>But to draw towards a clo&s;e, and as expre&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of my ideas, and the nature of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I &s;hall here add a divine hymn, entitled, Circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>AS in the foregoing letter I have wrote, as the grounds and warrant for infant bapti&s;m, the true &s;entiments of my own mind, as it has been led, I tru&s;t, to take the truth from the word of God it &s;elf, and not from humane te&s;timony; &s;o I have pro|ceeded with taking but very little notice, of what others have wrote on my &s;ide the que&s;tion before me.&mdash;So on the other hand, I don't pretend I have attended clo&s;ely to a multitude of argu|ments which bapti&s;t authors have advanced to &s;upport their prin|ciples, only ju&s;t &s;ome of them which fell in my way. For my de&s;ign and aim has been, in the above letter, to dwell mainly on the po&s;itive &s;ide, and &s;hew the &s;cripture e&s;tabli&s;hment thereof &mdash; And if what I have advanced on the po&s;itive &s;ide, for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of infant bapti&s;m, won't &s;tand the trial of God's written word: tis not the an&s;wering of a thou&s;and particular bapti&s;t arguments will make it &s;tand: but if the ground work and foun|dation I have gone upon, is warranted by the &s;cripture, then I think I may be excu&s;ed from being obliged to go the tedious round of all particulars. Or if hereafter I &s;hould judge it nece&s;|&s;ary, and think I have a call thereto in providence, to an&s;wer any oppo&s;ing arguments to the plan I have here laid down, I am ready to per&s;wade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;elf they may all be &s;hielded off, in a &s;hort
<PB N="71" REF="012076_0036_0F8993FA73E5D7C8">and conci&s;e manner.&mdash;Therefore I give this public no|tice, that if you, &s;ir, or any other bapti&s;t writer &s;hall pretend to an&s;wer this foregoing letter, and don't attend immediately and directly to the ground work I have laid down; but leaving that unmole&s;ted, at lea&s;t I mean if you don't attempt to mole&s;t it, but hover round about, or dwell upon other points, I &s;hall look upon it &s;o impertinent a performance, in all probability, that I &s;hall not think it worthy of any further reply.</P>
<P>But to this it may be you will an&s;wer, that you al&s;o have been upon the po&s;itive &s;ide, endeavouring to &s;hew the &s;cripture war|rant for the bapti&s;t principles, and had as good a right to require me to attend directly to your plan, and the ground-work thereof, but &s;eeing I have took another method, you have a right to call my performance &s;o impertinent a piece that it de&s;erves no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould &s;ay thus, I am willing to &s;ay amen to the con|trover&s;y; for I am far from de&s;iring to continue in it; but let the judicious and impartial judge which of the&s;e two po&s;itives, your &s;ide the que&s;tion and mine, both pretending to a &s;cripture warrant; I &s;ay, let the judicious judge which in reality has it.</P>
<P>In the &s;chool of Chri&s;t we mu&s;t, and may, learn to di&s;tingui&s;h between a man and his &s;entiments. The <HI>man</HI> we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love, his <HI>&s;entiments</HI> we may hate. And thro' grace, I tru&s;t I can &s;ay, truly, I remain a cordial friend to your per&s;on, altho' I have appeared again&s;t your &s;entiments.</P>
