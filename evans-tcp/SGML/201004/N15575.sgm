<HEAD>An ADDRESS to the STUDENTS Of DICKINSON COLLEGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER de&s;pairing even of life, and renounc|ing all hopes of being u&s;eful to this &s;emi|nary, it has plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore me to my former health and office. I hope it will be unne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing to convince you of my good will to this country, and to this College in particular. If abandoning an honourable and independent &s;tation, and renouncing the &s;ociety of many valuable and long tried friends; if my cro&s;&s;ing the va&s;t Atlantic, and expo&s;ing my life to the perils of a new climate, are not &s;ufficient to per&s;uade you of my good wi&s;hes, it will be needle&s;s to u&s;e any words to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my family, and the pains I have endured, both in body and mind &s;ince my arrival in this country, I &s;hall chearfully forget, if I &s;hall be enabled to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the con|ducting of your &s;tudies, and forming your ta&s;te and morals, &s;o that you may fulfil the hopes of your parents, and prove u&s;eful citizens to your country.</P>
<P>You are here a&s;&s;embled from various parts, and mu&s;t have different views and expectations in life,
<PB N="3" REF="019865_0003_0FAD3D5E82390BC8">
but I hope you are all agreed in the de&s;ire of learning, and re&s;olve to cultivate the powers of your mind, from a conviction that the knowledge you may acquire here, will enable you to fill with dignity and propriety the &s;everal &s;tations to which you may be called; and to contribute your parts to promote the happine&s;s, and to rai&s;e the reputation of this new and ri&s;ing empire.</P>
<P>It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to your progre&s;s in learning, that you form ju&s;t notions of its digni|ty, and importance to the public as well as to your|&s;elves as individuals. It is not to &s;pend your years in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, or to acquire a &s;uperfici|al tincture of letters, that you have been &s;ent hither with &s;o much trouble and expence by your parents. They expect &s;omething more &s;olid and u&s;eful in re|turn for their pains and charge on your account.&mdash; They hope that you will a&s;pire to excellence and di&s;tinction in your &s;tudies, and that the hone&s;t emu|lation which a public education produces, will en|gage you to an u&s;eful and diligent employment of your time here. You are now in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and the mo&s;t important time of life: your powers are fre&s;h, and ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement, and the impre&s;&s;ions that you receive at this time mu&s;t be of the utmo&s;t importance in determining your future &s;ates and characters. Your pre&s;ent rank as &s;tudents is honourable. As candidates for &s;cience, fame and con&s;equence, you ought to de&s;pi&s;e every thing that is mean and di&s;honourable, and think your time too precious to be &s;pent in trifles or vi|cious pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>A &s;uperficial application to learning is &s;o far from being u&s;eful, that it is greatly prejudicial. It
<PB N="4" REF="019865_0004_0FAD3D5F46D2BFF8">
fills the mind with confu&s;ed notions, and &s;ometimes with un&s;ufferable vanity; it tends to bring learning into di&s;grace, and leads the world to form fal&s;e no|tions of its tendency and importance. It creates a contempt and aver&s;ion to &s;tudy, and is apt to com|municate its baleful influence to future generations. It places the &s;tudent on a level with the forward &s;matterer, who&s;e learning is extracted from maga|zines and reviews, and who&s;e pertne&s;s ari&s;es only from his ignorance.</P>
<P>It is true that all are not endowed with equal pow|ers for making progre&s;s in letters, and that different &s;tudies are &s;uited to different tempers and characters: yet diligence, application and con&s;tant de&s;ire of &s;uc|ce&s;s, will carry every man as far as nature intended he &s;hould go; and the various branches of &s;tudy in which youth are exerci&s;ed, will point out to every &s;tudent what he is be&s;t qualified for, and develope the natural bent of his genius, &s;o as to direct him how to employ him&s;elf in future. But without applicati|on we can make no di&s;covery of our talents, and the indolent &s;tudent mu&s;t continue a child for life.</P>
<P>To encourage you to diligence, you ought to con|&s;ider that you have our reputation, as well as your own fame and intere&s;t, in your hands; and that much of the happine&s;s and &s;atisfaction of your parents de|pends on your pre&s;ent behaviour, and the manner in which you employ your time and talents. After a pretty long life &s;pent in the pur&s;uit of learning, and undergoing &s;o many dangers and troubles for pro|moting its increa&s;e in this country, I flatter my&s;elf that I have a name to lo&s;e; and you would do me a &s;en&s;ible and grievous injury, if it &s;hould be lo&s;t by your negligence. With regard to my colleagues,
<PB N="5" REF="019865_0005_0FAD3D604EFB4038">
I need &s;ay nothing, as you know their capacity and characters by actual experience. We all have an equal intere&s;t in your progre&s;s, as the world will not believe us to be good for any thing, unle&s;s you ap|pear to be profited by our pains and in&s;tructions. Your parents expect that you &s;hould return in&s;truct|ed and improved in the knowledge of men and things, and that you &s;hould be qualified for u&s;eful and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed &s;tations in life; and you cannot do ju&s;tice to them or to us, except by a diligent application to your &s;tudies, and a con&s;tant attention to moral duties.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the greate&s;t pains and diligence on our part will be quite abortive without your hearty con&s;ent and concurrence. To talk to the deaf, or, which is the &s;ame thing, to the thoughtle&s;s and inattentive, is labouring without plea&s;ure and without profit, and mu&s;t be extremely afflicting to every &s;en&s;ible and benevolent mind.&mdash; You have it in your power to render all our labours un&s;ucce&s;sful, and to baffle all our hopes of reputa|tion and u&s;efulne&s;s; but we hope you will not be &s;o ill-natured as to employ your power for &s;o vile a purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially as it mu&s;t at the &s;ame time in|volve your&s;elves in ignorance, in&s;ignificance, guilt and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>We would therefore beg, as the greate&s;t favour to our&s;elves, as well as the be&s;t &s;ervice you can do to your own character, to the intere&s;t of your parents and the public, that your con&s;ent may con&s;pire with our wi&s;hes to promote your be&s;t intere&s;ts: you mu&s;t &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch concurrence, and the mi&s;|chievous con&s;equences of refu&s;ing it. Let us al|ways find in you a readine&s;s to be in&s;tructed, and a de&s;ire of excelling in tho&s;e branches of knowledge
<PB N="6" REF="019865_0006_0FAD3D60C32BF748">
in which you are to be exerci&s;ed. The habit of at|tention, and a con&s;tant endeavour to under&s;tand and retain the in&s;tructions of your teachers, will make your &s;tudies ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, as well as profitable to you; and unle&s;s you make your &s;tudies your plea&s;ure, your &s;ituation as &s;tudents will be ex|ceedingly painful and uncomfortable, your atten|dance will be a burden: you will live the life of pri&s;oners, con&s;tantly di&s;plea&s;ed with your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, con&s;tantly longing for a change, with the di&s;mal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that you are lo&s;ing your time, and that your &s;ufferings are entirely without profit to your&s;elves or others.</P>
<P>With regard to your behaviour to us and to one another, we hope your parents have taught you the rudiments of good manners, and that you will not di&s;grace their in&s;tructions and example, by pe|tulance, impertinence or rudene&s;s of any kind.&mdash; The child who behaves rudely and improperly to others, di&s;honours his father's hou&s;e, and gives o|thers an occa&s;ion to believe that he has been ill-edu|cated, or that his parents have &s;et him a bad exam|ple. A haughty and quarrel&s;ome temper, a prone|ne&s;s to revenge and mi&s;chief, are mo&s;t fatal to the character and happine&s;s of youth, and afford the mo&s;t unfavourable progno&s;tic of their riper years. "Men are but children of a larger growth." Tho&s;e habits that are formed, &amp; tho&s;e propen&s;ities that are di&s;covered in youth, ordinarily prevail through the whole of life. Such &s;tudents as you are here, &s;uch citizens you will prove to the republic. If you now acquire a love of order, ju&s;tice, decency and obliging behaviour, you will be the delight of your parents, and the ornaments and &s;upports of the &s;tate; but if you indulge pride and revenge, if
<PB N="7" REF="019865_0007_0FAD3D61FA1A4480">
you are prone to quarrel, de&s;pi&s;e and fight with one another, what el&s;e can be expected from the growth of &s;uch habits, but that you &s;hould become the grief of your parents, a di&s;grace to your ma&s;ters, and friends, and the pe&s;ts and firebrands of every &s;o|ciety? Make your choice between the&s;e extremes.</P>
<P>We do not indeed expect from your early years, the coolne&s;s, the prudence &amp; the gravity of advanced age. Such errors as ari&s;e from the natural warmth, the innocent gaiety, and even the levity of youth, may be naturally expected and ea&s;ily pardoned: but we hope you will con&s;ider that you are no longer children, that by your admi&s;&s;ion into this &s;ociety, and being engaged in the &s;tudies and employments of men, you are con&s;idered as &s;ubjects of moral govern|ment, and &s;u&s;ceptible of the principles of law and order. You have already in a good mea&s;ure the command of your&s;elves, and are capable of di&s;cern|ing and being con&s;cious when you are in the wrong. With the&s;e capacities you may avoid the follies of childhood, and contract tho&s;e habits of attention and application that are proper for your age, and favourable to your progre&s;s in your &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s and trifling are the bane of youth, both with re&s;pect to learning and morals; the&s;e habits prevent progre&s;s, excite quarrels, and encourage the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruption of manners. They are the beginning of vices and of &s;orrows, and can not be too much checked and di&s;couraged. Trifling is a perverted activity which in every event leads to evil, and tends either to meanne&s;s or malice. Let me warn you e&s;pecially again&s;t one vice which is often prevalent among youth, and indicates or pro|motes the wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions: we mean the practice
<PB N="8" REF="019865_0008_0FAD3D625084E1C0">
of exciting or tempting one another to evil, and prompting them to deeds of malice or revenge.&mdash; To &s;ow di&s;cord among brethren, to irritate the cor|ruptions and evil pa&s;&s;ions of men, is the employ|ment of the devil, and ought to be held in the ut|mo&s;t abhorrence by all who would be wi&s;e or hap|py.</P>
<P>Magnanimity and dignity of behaviour are vir|tues that ought to be in high e&s;teem with youth, as they lay the foundations of a good character, and prevent our age from blu&s;hing for the meanne&s;s of our early years. But it is of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence to form ju&s;t notions of the&s;e virtues, and to be well informed wherein real magnanimity con|&s;i&s;ts. It is not in contempt of others, or prone|ne&s;s to revenge, or being the plague or terror of &s;ociety. On the contrary a per&s;on of true magna|nimity will always be ju&s;t to the merits of others, and will reckon nothing &s;o di&s;graceful as what is unju&s;t, and injurious to the rights of others; and will be a&s;hamed of every thing that is unworthy of human nature, or hurtful to the order of &s;ociety: he will be mild and gentle to others, and will ab|&s;tain from injuring them, for his own &s;ake as well as for theirs. He will not leave it in the power of every one to tempt him to indecent and pa&s;&s;ionate behaviour, nor di&s;grace him&s;elf becau&s;e another is injurious; but de&s;pi&s;ing the ignoble pa&s;&s;ion of re|venge, he will avoid the &s;ociety of the wicked, and a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who are capable of in&s;truct|ing and plea&s;ing him by their example, and incapa|ble of tempting him to indecency by injury.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual antidote again&s;t quarrelling and mean behaviour, is diligence and application to
<PB N="9" REF="019865_0009_0FAD3D635DB8C3C0">
your &s;tudies: all the vices and mi&s;eries of youth ari&s;e uniformly from ignorance and trifling. If you are idle, your lives will be at once unprofitable and unplea&s;ant. As an additional incitement to dili|gence, we would &s;ugge&s;t to you the advantages you enjoy as &s;tudents of this &s;eminary, and the di&s;advan|tages you mu&s;t labour under from its yet infant &s;tate. Both the&s;e ought to incite you to diligence, that you may improve the one, and &s;urmount or compen|&s;ate for the other. At pre&s;ent you have lei&s;ure, and opportunity of profiting by books and in&s;tructors. But as the&s;e can not yet be afforded you in &s;uch number and variety as is to be wi&s;hed, on this ac|count you ought to u&s;e more diligence to profit by the opportunities you have; and the fewer the&s;e are at pre&s;ent, the more honour will your diligence and &s;ucce&s;s reflect on your&s;elves, and on this new &s;ocie|ty.</P>
<P>If you ever hope to pro&s;per in learning, you will not content your&s;elves with reading tho&s;e parts only of cla&s;&s;ic authors that are prelected to you by your ma&s;ters, and of which you are to give an account to them. By confining your&s;elves to the&s;e, you effectually di&s;appoint their intentions, and render their pains u&s;ele&s;s to your&s;elves. By making you acquainted with a part, they intended to make you capable of reading the whole. There is no under&s;tanding the merit, nor profiting by the talents of an author, by con&s;ulting extracts or de|tached parts; you can not have time to read all that is excellent in them at &s;chool; and I know from ex|perience and ob&s;ervation, that a diligent boy will go through the whole of any author in a &s;horter time than the unequal abilities of a cla&s;s will get thro' that part that is taught in public.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019865_0010_0FAD3D63C12624C8">Altho' the rules of grammar and con&s;truction are nece&s;&s;ary in order to under&s;tand foreign languages, you mu&s;t not think you have done when you have made your&s;elves ma&s;ters of the&s;e. It remains to at|tend to the &s;en&s;e, the hi&s;tory, the &s;entiment, and the beauties of thought and language; to enter in|to the &s;cope and &s;pirit of the writer, to di&s;cern his excellencies and to detect his weakne&s;s, or that of the times in which he lived. The cla&s;&s;ics are u&s;eful, not from their being writ in dead languages, or be|cau&s;e it co&s;ts a great deal of pains to read them: but they are valuable as models of ju&s;t thinking, exam|ples of true ta&s;te, and monuments of the wi&s;dom and capacity of ancient nations, and have been the delight and wonder of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations.</P>
<P>You ought always to remember that real learn|ing does not con&s;i&s;t in acquiring a great many con|fu&s;ed and indige&s;ted ideas, nor in performing pub|lic exerci&s;es with &s;uch apparent propriety as to per|&s;uade others that you are learned: far le&s;s does it con&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of har&s;h and uncouth terms, which are not familiar to ordinary under&s;tandings, but that it con&s;i&s;ts in the exerci&s;e and application of the powers of the mind, the improvement of our in|tuitive as well as our active faculties, in the know|ledge and di&s;cerning of truth, and &s;uch an acquain|tance with human nature and its excellencies and defects, its acqui&s;itions and hi&s;tory, as may fit us for the right conduct of life, and for promoting the happine&s;s of our&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>In order to profit by reading, meditation and at|tention mu&s;t be joined with it, we mu&s;t not pa&s;s by any thing that we do not under&s;tand, or content our&s;elves with a &s;ingle reading of what is u&s;eful,
<PB N="11" REF="019865_0011_0FAD3DE968E4EEE0">
excellent or nece&s;&s;ary; and we ought to labour to retain what we have read, becau&s;e it is only that which we retain that can be profitable to us in fu|ture. Inattentive and de&s;ultory reading is only a more active idlene&s;s, and a more decent mode of trifling. It is better to &s;hut the book as &s;oon as at|tention fails, than to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to read without it.</P>
<P>A fooli&s;h tru&s;ting to public exerci&s;es has been the ruin of many &s;tudents. To confine our&s;elves to our pre&s;cribed le&s;&s;ons, and our &s;tudies to the public hours, argues a narrow mind, de&s;titute of ambiti|on, and in&s;en&s;ible of the excellence and charms of true learning. Poor and &s;canty mu&s;t be the attain|ments of the pretended &s;tudent, who &s;eigns atten|tion in public, and is idle and negligent in private! This is rendering public exerci&s;es entirely u&s;elell, and thwarting the intention of your in&s;tructors. As that can be done in public is to pre&s;cribe general rules, to remove difficulties, to caution again&s;t er|rors, and &s;ugge&s;t u&s;eful hints and directions; but the main bu&s;ine&s;s of learning is to be compa&s;&s;ed on|ly by private &s;tudy and meditation; and the &s;tudent who does not apply his diligence in private, mi&s;un|der&s;tands the true nature and de&s;ign of public in|&s;tructions. Tho&s;e parents likewi&s;e are greatly mi&s;|taken who in&s;i&s;t that their children &s;hould be kept to long confinement and attendance, &s;o as to leave them neither time, &s;pirits or inclination for private &s;tudy. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould be made &s;cholars in this manner. Such injunctions di&s;cover a deep ignorance of human nature, as if it were po&s;|&s;ible to teach boys again&s;t their will, or force them into learning by whipping and impri&s;onment. The&s;e methods may readily produce a rooted aver&s;ion for
<PB N="12" REF="019865_0012_0FAD3DEA72CD14C8">
learning, as it is certain that they render progre&s;s in it utterly unattainable and impracticable; but they will never make boys in love with &s;tudy, or ambitious to excel in knowledge. Even in the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es, the &s;tudent mu&s;t prepare his le&s;&s;on at home, if he expects to be able to plea&s;e his ma&s;|ter, or keep up with his cla&s;s; but &s;uch regulations as leave no time for this, deprive the &s;tudent of opportunities of profiting, and oblige the ma&s;ter to labour in vain.</P>
<P>As our public library is as yet but indifferently furni&s;hed, and could never &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of all, and as the procuring a variety of books in a new country is utterly impo&s;&s;ible, you ought to be more diligent in the u&s;e of all the books you can command, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as lead to the know|ledge of others. Without a tolerable acquaintance with literary hi&s;tory, a &s;tudent can not pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies, whatever opportunities and helps he may enjoy. He mu&s;t be at a lo&s;s where to apply for help, unle&s;s he knows what authors have treat|ed of the &s;ubject in which he de&s;ires information.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;cover the genius and capacity of &s;tudents, and to &s;ugge&s;t u&s;eful hints for conducting their &s;tudies and regulating their conduct, I am con|vinced that private acquaintance and conver&s;ation are of great u&s;e. It will therefore be agreeable to me to receive vi&s;its from all of the &s;tudents, as of|ten as their &s;tudies and mine will permit, and to &s;ugge&s;t to them what may be u&s;eful, as well as to re&s;olve their doubts and difficulties, being deter|mined to act as the private preceptor, as well as the public in&s;tructor of every &s;tudent, without excepti|on or re&s;pect of per&s;ons, who comes to this &s;e|minary in que&s;t of u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="019865_0013_0FAD3DEB03C89508">As concord and order are the &s;oul and &s;trength of every &s;ociety, and peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;emina|ry for the &s;tudy of letters, we hope that every &s;tu|dent will reckon it his honour to &s;tudy the&s;e with the greate&s;t care; and to attain the&s;e you ought to reflect how di&s;graceful it is to di&s;turb &s;ociety, and to appear impatient of order and equal &s;ociety. It will be our part to render all of you equal ju&s;tice and encouragement, but it will depend on your conduct to render our labours plea&s;ant and profita|ble. Beware of pride, from which contention cometh; abhor inju&s;tice and in&s;ulting manners, and avoid all indecent and provoking expre&s;&s;ions. Re|member that your character as well as your &s;ucce&s;s in learning, depends on your pre&s;ent behaviour, and that if you do not &s;hew your&s;elves regular, well-bred and peaceable &s;tudents, there can be lit|tle hope of your becoming u&s;eful or e&s;timable citi|zens of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>As your time is your greate&s;t trea&s;ure, and may be employed to the be&s;t account, we would earne&s;t|ly recommend a prudent and thrifty improvement of it. For this purpo&s;e you ought to ri&s;e early, and beware of &s;pending too much of it in unnece&s;|&s;ary exerci&s;es or childi&s;h recreations. You have much to do, and unle&s;s you apply to yout &s;tudies betimes, you mu&s;t be great lo&s;ers. Be&s;ides, &s;aun|tering and idlene&s;s are inimical to habits of appli|cation; and by neglecting to &s;tudy, you may &s;oon become incapable of it. If you would practi&s;e the le&s;&s;on of Pythagoras, and examine every evening what you have been doing all day, you will di&s;co|ver the value of time, and the folly of idlene&s;s, by ob&s;erving how little you have done, in compari|&s;on
<PB N="14" REF="019865_0014_0FAD3DEBA398E658">
of what you might have done, which may lead to a better improvement of time for the future.</P>
<P>You ought never to forget that all true learning is &s;ubordinate and conducive to morals and u&s;eful|ne&s;s. It is not in order that you may be admired for your talents that your parents have be&s;towed on you benefits of a liberal education. They expect that you &s;hould become virtuous, orderly and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, that you &s;hould know how to e&s;teem true excellence, to revere truth and honour, to form your&s;elves upon the be&s;t models, to de&s;pi&s;e every thing that is mean and vicious, to delight in promoting the happine&s;s of others, to be lovers of peace, to form friend&s;hip with the virtuous and worthy, to avoid the &s;ociety of the wicked, and to merit and command the e&s;teem of the wi&s;er part of your fellow citizens.</P>
<P>Young people are apt to imagine that they have little to do with religion, and that it is time enough to think of that in mature life; but this is a griev|ous mi&s;take. "Train up a child," &s;ays Solomon, "in the way that he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Even a child is known by his way, whether it be pure and whether it be right. Young as you are, you have a con&s;cience; you are &s;ubjects of moral di&s;cipline, and &s;u&s;ceptible of good or bad moral characters. You know not whether you may live to mature age, and what &s;hall become of your &s;ouls if you die in an igno|rant, thoughtle&s;s and irreligious &s;tate? We pre|&s;ume that your parents have taught you to know and honour the God who made you, to revere his name, and to pray to him daily, for the pardon of your &s;ins, the purifying of your natures, and final

happine&s;s and &s;alvation through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We hope you are in&s;tructed in the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s and virtue as the only means to fit you for eternal life. It &s;hall be our endeavour to &s;econd the le&s;|&s;ons and intentions, as well as to fulfil the wi&s;hes of your parents, &s;o far as is in our power, by &s;ug|ge&s;ting to you as occa&s;ion offers, &s;uitable advices for your moral and religious conduct in life; and in &s;o doing we are &s;ure of plea&s;ing them by endeavouring to promote your real happine&s;s. Even wicked and thoughtle&s;s parents would be &s;orry to &s;ee their chil|dren growing up in vicious habits; and nothing can exceed the &s;orrow of virtuous and chri&s;tian parents when their children walk not in the ways of God. Give joy to your parents, and to your ma&s;ters and friends, by an early application to religious know|ledge and practice; read the word of God with care, reverence and attention: pray to God for wi&s;dom and &s;piritual under&s;tanding, and ye &s;hall not a&s;k in vain. Be a&s;&s;ured that it is your highe&s;t honour to honour God, to thank him for his benefits, and keep his commandments; you will be more worthy of the e&s;teem of your neighbours, if you pray to God morning and evening, if you &s;tudy to plea&s;e him, and to keep the &s;abbath day holy, to ab&s;tain from all mean and vicious conduct. You may a&s;|&s;ure your&s;elves that &s;uch a conduct will contribute no le&s;s to your progre&s;s in learning than your im|provement in virtue. God is the father of our &s;pi|rits and ought to be acknowledged and wor&s;hipped in that character. He made our &s;ouls, with all their wonderful powers; and their improvement and exerci&s;e mu&s;t depend on his bounty. The know|ledge of the plowman and the mechanic is attribut|ed in &s;cripture to the teaching of God, and that

large and comprehen&s;ive knowledge which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed king Solomon, is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to have been the gift of God. And who el&s;e can give it? As in religion, &s;o likewi&s;e in learning, though Paul may plant, and Apollos water, it belongs to God only to give the increa&s;e. You are gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;taken if you imagine that a religious life is melancholy or di&s;a|greeable; on the contrary it is the only road to true plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. To have God for your friend, your father and defender, is true dignity as well as &s;olid peace and confidence. Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that de&s;ireth life and loveth many days, that he may &s;ee good? keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from &s;peak|ing guile, depart from evil and do good: &s;eek peace, and pur&s;ue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. The face of God is again&s;t them that do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth. Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is under&s;tanding.</P>
