<P>THESE words contain the in&s;tructions which Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;ties, immediately before his a&s;cen&s;ion into hea|ven. And we have here their Mi&s;&s;ion, with the commi&s;&s;i|on and authority given them for the execution of that office in the church, to which they were ordained.&mdash;The Object they were to attend to in their mini&s;try, which was to make all nations di&s;|ciples, baptizing them in the name of the divine Trinity, teaching them to ob&s;erve all the commandments of Chri&s;t.&mdash;And the En|couragement they were to act upon in this great undertaking; even the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence with them to the end of the world; implying, that the go&s;pel mini&s;try was to continue, in them and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till time &s;hould be no more; that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed for, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ork; and that their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours &s;hould be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>The whole &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry, may be reduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e two points, viz. What is Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m? And who are the proper &s;ubjects of it? The&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to re&s;olve b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the light of divine revelation&mdash;And as I claim no dominion over the faith of any, &s;o I would &s;peak as unto wi&s;e men, judge ye what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which may come under examination, I would premi&s;e a few po&s;tulates, or rules of interpreting the &s;criptures, which I think cannot rea&s;onably be refu&s;ed, or objected to.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;criptures are always to be under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e of the words, which, taken in their connection, is mo&s;t natural, plain, obvious, and familiar to us, and tho&s;e for who&s;e in&s;tructi|on
<PB N="5" REF="017187_0004_0FA071DE4DED1810">they were primarily de&s;igned. The literal &s;en&s;e is always to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> preferred to a figurative one, unle&s;s there appear plain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood rea&s;ons to the contrary. For in&s;tance, though the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in our text is &s;ometimes taken in a figurative &s;en&s;e, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing of the Holy Spirit; yet as it literally and primarily &s;igni|fies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing with water, and this &s;en&s;e was mo&s;t obvious and familiar to the Apo&s;tles, and is &s;o to us, and the word commonly bears this &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;tament, and there appears no in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gruity with the context, or incon&s;i&s;tence with other parts of the &s;criptures, in under&s;tanding it thus in this place; we there|fore conclude, that it is a Literal and Water Bapti&s;m that is here intended. On the contrary, when Chri&s;t tells his Apo&s;tles, "I am with you to the end of the world." We cannot under&s;tand th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> words literally, of his bodily pre&s;ence. For, as the apo&s;tles were to di&s;per&s;e into different and remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> parts of the world, it was impo&s;&s;ible that Chri&s;t &s;hould be always with them bodily. And be&s;ides, he was immediately to a&s;cend to, and remain in hea|ven, till the end of the world. This mu&s;t therefore be under|&s;tood Figuratively, of tho&s;e gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances which he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to them.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture is the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t interpreter of Scripture, and if the meaning of any word or phra&s;e &s;eems doubtful, we mu&s;t compare it with other places, where a like expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed, or where the &s;ame &s;ubject is treated of perhaps in plainer language: and that interpretation is be adhered to, which is mo&s;t con&s;onant to the general language and doctrine of the &s;criptures them&s;elves. Thus the word Baptize, in our text, may be compared with, and explained by the words of the apo&s;tle, in which he &s;ays, "That the church is &s;anctified by the wa&s;hing of water with the word:" whence we are to conclude that water Bapti&s;m is a go&s;pel ordi|nance: and that Bapti&s;m &s;ignifies a wa&s;hing.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures are to be under&s;tood as containing not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> truths which are expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted, but al&s;o tho&s;e which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly implied. For example, it is not expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that Bapti&s;m is to be a &s;tanding ordinance in the church to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> end of the world. But then, as Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to be with his mini&s;ters in the execution of their commi&s;&s;ion to the end of the world; and as they were in this their commi&s;&s;ion in&s;tructed to baptize, as well as teach; it is a fair con&s;equence, that the duties, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well as the encouragements contained in their commi&s;&s;ion, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to continue to the end of time; and &s;o bapti&s;m is a &s;tanding or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance&mdash;And that this is the true meaning, implied, though not expre&s;&s;ed in the text.</P>
<P N="4">4. That is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture which be&s;t agrees with the original text. Though the &s;criptures were written in He|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew and Greek, by divine in&s;piration, yet they were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;lated by divine in&s;piration&mdash;Some words are not ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y tran&s;lated; and are to be corrected by the original. Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I think, is an example&mdash;This clau&s;e, "go teach all nations,"
<PB N="6" REF="017187_0005_0FA071DF0C9EB298">ought rather to be under&s;tood, "Go make all nations di&s;ciples," for &s;o the Greek word properly &s;ignifies. To teach or indoctrin|ate is expre&s;&s;ed by another word, which we have in the latter ver&s;e of our text: Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;o|ever I have commanded.</P>
<P N="5">5. That interpretation of &s;cripture is to be adhered to, which gives the be&s;t, apte&s;t, and mo&s;t in&s;tructive &s;en&s;e to the words: unle&s;s it &s;hould appear that a different &s;en&s;e was intended&mdash;Thus for example, I think it makes better &s;en&s;e to read our text ac|cording to the amendment propo&s;ed; "Go make all nations di&s;ciples; baptizing and teaching them, &amp;c." than t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> read it ac|cording to our tran&s;lation, "Go teach all nations; baptizing them&mdash;teaching them;" where the repetition of the word Teach, &s;eems needle&s;s and unin&s;tructive.</P>
<P N="6">6. The practice of the primitive church, &s;o far as it is known, is to be attended to, in ca&s;e doubts &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e concerning the meaning and proper admini&s;tration of go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inances. The meaning of precepts is &s;ometimes cleared and a&s;certained by au|thentic precedents. And we have no precedents which are &s;o much to be regarded by us as the practice of the church in its earlie&s;t and pure&s;t &s;tate; e&s;pecially in the apo&s;tolic age. For example, in our text bapti&s;m with water is not expre&s;sly mention|ed; but we know that in the apo&s;tolic and primitive church, bap|ti&s;m with water was practi&s;ed: which &s;eems to put the matter out of all rea&s;onable doubt, that it is a water bapti&s;m that is here intended.</P>
<P>Keeping the&s;e rules in mind, let us &s;earch the &s;criptures upon the &s;ubjects of our pre&s;ent enquiry. And the fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is, "What is Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m&punc;"</P>
<P>In our text, Chri&s;t commi&s;&s;ions his mini&s;ters to baptize the na|tions. We borrow the word Bapti&s;m from the Greeks; among whom it was commonly u&s;ed to &s;ignify a wetting or wa&s;hing in &s;ome mode, as I &s;hall &s;hew more particularly in the &s;equel. Among chri&s;tians, bapti&s;m is that Religious and Sacramental wa&s;hing with Water, which Chri&s;t has appointed as the token and &s;ign of our admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, and of our hav|ing an intere&s;t in the privileges, and coming under the obligations of the go&s;pel covenant. That Chri&s;t did in&s;titute the rite of bap|ti&s;m, or wa&s;hing with water in the name of the Trinity, our text, as compared with other places of &s;cripture, is a clear and &s;uffici|ent proof; notwith&s;tanding the cavils of tho&s;e who would per|&s;uade us that only a &s;piritual and figurative Bapti&s;m is required of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>For, how unrea&s;onable is it to depart needle&s;sly from the pri|mary, literal, plain, and obvious &s;en&s;e of the word; and embrace a my&s;tical and metaphorical interpretation? The apo&s;tles would naturally under&s;tand that a wa&s;hing of the body was enjoined. For this was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e that they were familiarly acquainted with, and
<PB N="7" REF="017187_0006_0FA071DFD0579BE8">had often admini&s;tred them&s;elves. It was, it &s;eems, a common token of di&s;ciple&s;hip, during the mini&s;try of John the bapti&s;t, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The word, Baptize, is commonly in the new te&s;ta|ment to be under&s;tood of a wa&s;hing with water. The apo&s;tle's words &s;hew, that the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is of this kind. For he &s;ays, "that Chri&s;t &s;anctifies his church with the wa&s;hing of water, by the word
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 26.</NOTE>." And it is accordingly manife&s;t that the apo&s;tle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did admini&s;ter a water bapti&s;m: "Can any man forbid water," &s;ays Peter, at the hou&s;e of Cornelius
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 47.</NOTE>, that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized: the Eunuch too was baptized with water
<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 36, 38, 39.</NOTE>, and &s;o no doubt, all tho&s;e were of who&s;e bapti&s;m we have account. And as we mu&s;t believe that the apo&s;tles acted agreeable to the commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions they received from Chri&s;t; &s;o their practice is a mo&s;t authentic precedent, whereby the nature and true meaning of chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, which is to be admini&s;tred to all nations, is illu&s;trated and a&s;certained. And it has accordingly been con|&s;tantly practi&s;ed in the church, ever &s;ince the a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;tles.</P>
<P>But let it &s;uffice to have hinted thus briefly at the proofs we have of the divine in&s;titution of water bapti&s;m. There are other points which will need to be more particularly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Some, who agree with us in acknowledging, that water bapti&s;m is a go&s;pel ordinance, yet hold <Q>that dipping is the only lawful and valid way of admini&s;tring it; and that pouring or &s;prinkling of water is no true bapti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>This matter mu&s;t therefore be enquired into: for, though it may &s;eem of no great importance in it&s;elf, in which mode the ordi|nance is admini&s;tred, (and indeed with us it is a matter of indif|ference) yet the advocates for dipping, generally lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon this particular mode, as makes a &s;candalous &s;chi&s;m in the church, whereby the edification of the body of Chri&s;t in holi|ne&s;s, love, peace and comfort, is greatly ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>That dipping is a lawful mode of bapti&s;m we freely grant: And we &s;hould &s;carce think it worth while to di&s;pute the matter with any, who &s;hould be of opinion, that this is the mo&s;t proper and &s;ignificant way; if they would not hold it to be ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and &s;o place the e&s;&s;ence of the ordinance in what we verily believe to be but an indifferent circum&s;tance. We are ready to admini&s;ter the ordinance by immer&s;ion occa&s;ionally, if it be de|&s;ired. But as we look upon our&s;elves, as being at liberty in re&s;pect of the mode of bapti&s;m, we think it our duty to <Q>Stand fa&s;t in this liberty;</Q> and not be intangled with the yoke of bondage, which we cannot find that Chri&s;t has laid upon us.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome, who are not content to enjoy all the liberty in our churches that they can rea&s;onably de&s;ire for them|&s;elves: with them there is no true bapti&s;m without dipping: nor will they have chri&s;tian communion with any but tho&s;e who have gone into the water. According to them, there are no Go&s;pel churches in the world, except of tho&s;e who have been dipped.
<PB N="8" REF="017187_0007_0FA071E08D3879C8">None are regularly called or &s;ent of God to preach the word, and admini&s;ter go&s;pel ordinances, till they have been dipped. None may pre&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or be admitted to the table of the Lord, till they have been dipped. And thus, as much as in them lies, they unchurch all the churches in the world, except tho&s;e who agree with them in the mode of baptizing.&mdash;They deny the call and mi&s;&s;ion of their mini&s;ters; invalidate and nullify their ordi|nances, and excommunicate thou&s;ands, whom they cannot deny to be eminent for faith and holine&s;s; and, in a word, make the door of the vi&s;ible church &s;o much narrower than Chri&s;t has made the gate of Heaven, that they reject far the greater part of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t receives.</P>
<P>Now, however willing we are to have Chri&s;tian communion with all who, in a judgment of charity, are di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; yet if we cannot have it, unle&s;s we will di&s;card the greater part of our chri&s;tian brethren; deny the mi&s;&s;ions and call of tho&s;e, who&s;e mini&s;try has been the means of our own conver&s;ion and edificati|on, deny the validity of tho&s;e ordinances, which have &s;o often been brea&s;ts of nouri&s;hment and con&s;olation to us, and renounce our bapti&s;m, which we are con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded is both valid and regular; this we cannot con&s;ent to.&mdash;And if any make this a ground of &s;eparation from us, let all who have imbibed the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity judge, whether it be our fault; and whether &s;uch rigidne&s;s in a matter &s;o circum&s;tantial, is agreeable to the meek and charitable &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel, or whether it does not rather look too much like phari&s;aical &s;uper&s;tition, to &s;ay no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Methinks our opponents have more rea&s;on to que&s;tion the va|lidity of their own admini&s;tration, than to deny ours, upon the account of &s;uch irregularities as they charge upon us. For they cannot deny that the bapti&s;m which is admini&s;tred in their com|munions was received at fir&s;t by their predece&s;&s;ors, from the hands of &s;uch as, according to their principles, were unbapti&s;ed, and con&s;equently could not be regularly authorized to admini&s;ter the ordinance. If they think &s;prinkling to be no true bapti&s;m, much more have they rea&s;on to doubt the validity of immer&s;ion, when performed by an unbaptized and unauthorized admini&s;tra|tor. And, if the fir&s;t bapti&s;ms of that &s;ect, when they fir&s;t &s;prung up, were invalid, how can tho&s;e admini&s;trations be thought va|lid and regular, which depend upon them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore conclude, that dipping cannot be e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m and Chri&s;tian communion. The con&s;equences are not to be endured.&mdash;The difficulties this principle will lead to, are inex|tricable.&mdash;We never can be &s;atisfied that there is any true church, or valid bapti&s;m and ordinances in the world, upon the&s;e narrow principles.&mdash;And, as a farther pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of dipping, let it be con&s;idered, that as bapti&s;m is enjoined on all the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, the outward rite is doubt|le&s;s, &s;uch as may be applied to all, whatever their circum&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="017187_0008_0FA071E14E962950">may be.&mdash;But there are many who cannot be dipped without ex|treme inconvenience and danger. In &s;ome parts of the world, water cannot be obtained for the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es, without great difficulty and expence. How then can the poor get &s;uch large &s;upplies as are nece&s;&s;ary for an immer&s;ion? In cold climates, and in the winter &s;ea&s;on, it would be dangerous to mo&s;t, and, without a miracle, fatal to many to be plunged under water. Can we &s;up|po&s;e that Chri&s;t has required it, as an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, that tho&s;e &s;hould be dipped, who are &s;o &s;ick and weak, that it would endan|ger their lives to wa&s;h their hands, or be expo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a minute to the cold air? And yet there is no doubt but it may be the duty of &s;uch to receive bapti&s;m.&mdash;Can we think it credible, that Chri&s;t's ea&s;y yoke and light burden &s;hould, in the ca&s;e of bapti&s;m, prove much more grievous and heavy, in many in&s;tances, than even the yoke of circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations are certainly of &s;o much weight, that the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping ought not to be in&s;i&s;ted on, unle&s;s there be clear and cogent rea&s;ons for it. The &s;ub&s;tance of what is pleaded in favour of this mode, is reduceable to the&s;e five heads:</P>
<P>"That the proper meaning of the word Baptize, always im|plies dipping.</P>
<P>"That the &s;criptural examples of bapti&s;m were admini&s;tered in this way.</P>
<P>"That this mode of admini&s;tration is plainly pointed out, when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, "We are buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m."</P>
<P>"That dipping only an&s;wers to and fitly repre&s;ents the thing &s;ignified in bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>"That the primitive church admini&s;tered the ordinance by dipping."</P>
<P>On the contrary, we think, that the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping can|not be argued from any of the&s;e topics; but that they will fur|ni&s;h us with a good warrant in favour of the mode of affu&s;ion or &s;prinkling. Let us examine the matter di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>And our fir&s;t enquiry is, what is the true and proper meaning of the word Baptize, and whether it always implies dipping? We grant that the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t requires whatever is e&s;&s;ential to a true Bapti&s;m; but more than this cannot be held nece&s;&s;ary. Now, we have no &s;ort of evidence, that the word Baptize always implies dipping; but it plainly appears to be of a larger and more general &s;ignification. It properly imports a wetting, wa&s;hing, bathing, in any mode, either by dipping or &s;prinkling, or bleed|ing, or weeping, or otherwi&s;e. In proof of this we appeal,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to tho&s;e who are acknowledged to have been be&s;t &s;killed in the Greek language. All the Lexicons and critics, &s;o far as I have found, agree, that the word &s;ignifies to wet, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wa&s;h, as well as to dip. And if any who a&s;&s;ert, that dipping is con&s;tantly implied, have pretended, that the learned ma&s;ters of the Greek held with them, it is certainly a mi&s;repre&s;entation.
<PB N="10" REF="017187_0009_0FA071E20D46F0E8">There has not one been found of any character or note, &s;o &s;aying or intimating, but quite the contrary, they do with one con&s;ent explain the word as I have &s;aid. And they have &s;hewn by clear and manifold examples from Greek writers, that wa&s;hing or wet|ting, in whatever mode, whether &s;prinkling or dipping, is Bap|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid by &s;ome, <Q>That the native, primary, and only proper meaning of the word Bapti&s;m, is dipping: That it &s;ig|nifies wa&s;hing only, con&s;equentially and improperly: That it is only &s;uch wa&s;hing as &s;uppo&s;es, and is effected by dipping, that is expre&s;&s;ed by this word: That the primary and proper &s;en&s;e is to be preferred to a con&s;equential and improper one.</Q> To the&s;e &s;everal allegations I would reply;</P>
<P>We have no certainty that dipping is the primary and native &s;ignification of this word, or that wa&s;hing or wetting is a con&s;e|quential or &s;econdary &s;en&s;e; though it is true, that &s;ome learned men have been of that opinion. I &s;hould think, that wetting bids faire&s;t to be the fir&s;t native, and original import of the word: For this is the e&s;&s;ential idea (if I may &s;o &s;peak) which is always con|nected with, and implied in every true and proper bapti&s;m. But we have many undeniable in&s;tances, in writers &s;acred and pro|fane, where the word Bapti&s;m is u&s;ed to expre&s;s a wetting, with|out any dipping at all. Some of the&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to men|tion pre&s;ently. But, whatever the primary &s;en&s;e of the word may be (which I leave to the critics, it being a matter of no con&s;e|quence) certain it is, that wa&s;hing, in general, without re&s;triction, to any mode, is a true and proper bapti&s;m, by the general acknow|ledgement of the learned

And if we &s;hould admit that this is
<PB N="11" REF="017187_0010_0FA071E2CCD4C658">not the primary, but a &s;econdary and con&s;equential meaning, what proof, probability, or pre&s;umption can we gather from thence, that this is not the true &s;en&s;e that Chri&s;t meant the words &s;hould bear, in the in&s;titution of the ordinance of bapti&s;m? A man mu&s;t be very inattentive to the nature of language, who needs to be informed, that the native and primary meaning of words, is not the only meaning in which they may be commonly and properly u&s;ed: And that by cu&s;tom, the original &s;ignificati|on of numberle&s;s words is changed, enlarged, or re&s;tricted. It may &s;eem needle&s;s to give examples for the illu&s;tration of &s;o obvious a remark. A proclamation primarily &s;ignifies &s;omething uttered, proclaimed, or publi&s;hed, with a loud voice; yet, as the word is commonly u&s;ed and under&s;tood, this mode of publi&s;hing is not at all implied or intimated. An infant primarily &s;ignifies a child unable to &s;peak: But we under&s;tand by it any child under the age of di&s;cretion. And, to add another example, which may be a good parallel with the word Baptize: To Bathe, in the prima|ry &s;en&s;e, may perhaps imply an immer&s;ion; and yet it is com|monly u&s;ed to expre&s;s a wetting, or wa&s;hing in other ways; ei|ther by dipping, or pouring, or dropping on, or applying wet clothes, as is mo&s;t convenient. And, a man would be ridiculous who &s;hould contend, when ordered to bathe any part of his bo|dy, that dipping is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, however inconvenient, and dangerous; and that becau&s;e bathing primarily &s;ignifies dip|ping, as he &s;uppo&s;es. Whether a primary or a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e of any word is to be preferred, as the true &s;en&s;e intended, can on|ly be determined by other con&s;iderations. In &s;hort, whatever be the primary meaning of the word baptize, which is uncertain, it is however agreed by all critics of note, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignifies wa&s;hing or wetting in general, without re&s;triction to any particular mode; and particularly &s;uch a wa&s;hing as is not effected by dipping. We have not the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;umption, from any thing that appears in the in&s;titution of Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, that the word is not there to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame indeterminate manner, or that Chri&s;t meant to confine his di&s;ciples to any particular mode. Wa&s;hing, in general, in any convenient mode, mu&s;t therefore be pre&s;umed to be the true intent of the in&s;titution: For, as the words of the in&s;titution fairly admit of this interpretation, and nothing of any weight can be objected again&s;t it; and as it is not
<PB N="12" REF="017187_0011_0FA071E38CCC6DA0">credible, that a mode of wa&s;hing, &s;o inconvenient, difficult, ha|zardous, and even impracticable as dipping mu&s;t &s;ometimes be, &s;hould be enjoined on all; the &s;en&s;e we have given is in this ca&s;e the preferable &s;en&s;e, and has every advantage to recommend it.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it may be &s;aid, <Q>That critics are not infallible, and it may be &s;u&s;pected that they are wrong, in &s;aying, that wa&s;hing or wetting in general, in whatever mode, is expre&s;&s;ed and meant by the word Bapti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer; in que&s;tions concerning the true meaning of words, the judgment of the learned, though not infallible, is doubtle&s;s of very con&s;iderable weight; and e&s;pecially when we find a ge|neral con&s;ent among them. And that there certainly is upon this point, that wa&s;hing or wetting, without re&s;pect to the mode, is Bapti&s;m, according to the u&s;age of the word by Greek writers. But if any are yet un&s;at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sfied, we mu&s;t examine the matter fur|ther; whether it can certainly be made to appear that the word bears the &s;en&s;e which has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>They who have been at the pains to examine the Greek cla&s;|&s;ics, (Dr. Wall in particular) have proved by clear and manifold examples, that tho&s;e ancient writers were wont to u&s;e the word Bapti&s;e to expre&s;s a wa&s;hing or wetting, even where there was no dipping at all, but only a &s;prinkling. But I think it will be need|le&s;s to enquire, how the word was commonly under&s;tood by heathen writers. It is the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e alone that we are &s;earching after. If this can be a&s;certained we need no more.</P>
<P>Now, the Apo&s;tles have explained bapti&s;m to mean no more nor le&s;s than wa&s;hing with water, and never once make u&s;e of any word to expre&s;s it by, or any phra&s;e or form of expre&s;&s;ion, that &s;ignifies or implies dipping. They certainly knew the true in|tendment of the word in the in&s;titution. If we can find how they under&s;tood the matter, we may be &s;ure that we have found the true and preferable &s;en&s;e, let men call it a con&s;equential improper &s;en&s;e, or what they plea&s;e. Paul gives us the Scriptural &s;en&s;e of the word Bapti&s;m, when he &s;ays, Eph. v. 2. That "Chri&s;t &s;anctifies his church with the wa&s;hing of water by the word." That b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p|ti&s;m is meant by the wa&s;hing with water I &s;uppo&s;e will not be denied. And the&s;e words &s;hew that a wa&s;hing with water is a true bapti&s;m. From whence we may fairly conclude, that it is the wa&s;hing with water, and not any particular mode, that is intended by Chri&s;t in the in&s;titution of bapti&s;m. We have the very &s;ame de&s;cription of bapti&s;m in Heb. x. 22, 23. <Q>Having our hearts &s;prinkled from an evil con&s;cience, and our bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es wa&s;hed with pure water, let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith,</Q> &amp;c. And many &s;uppo&s;e that bapti&s;m is meant by the "wa&s;hing of regeneration." Tit. iii. 5. And once more, the outward bap|ti&s;mal wa&s;hing is de&s;cribed as "A putting away the filth of the fle&s;h." 1 Pet. iii. 21. In all the&s;e de&s;criptions it is remarkable
<PB N="13" REF="017187_0012_0FA071E44E135CF0">that there is not the lea&s;t hint of dip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g, as any way implied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bapti&s;m; but the whole account we have of the matter, all that we can learn of the nature of this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed rite is, that it is "a wa&s;hing with water."</P>
<P>Now, if dipping had been the only and nece&s;&s;ary mode, is it any ways credible that the apo&s;tles &s;hould always de&s;cribe it as a mere wa&s;hing, and never once u&s;e any word or phra&s;e concern|ing it from which we can infer immer&s;ion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is certainly a fault in writing, needle&s;sly to u&s;e words of an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erminate meaning, and which tend to lead the reader into a wrong apprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject. And can we think that the in&s;pired apo&s;tles were &s;o lax and inaccurate in their accounts of bapti&s;m, as con&s;tantly to leave out the very e&s;&s;ence of the ordinance, and not point out that mode of admini&s;tration, without which the wa&s;hing is a mere nullity. The language they wrote in affords a variety of words &s;ignifying immer&s;ion, &s;ome of which they make u&s;e of on other occa&s;ions, but never once to expre&s;s the rite of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;aid by &s;ome that the word Louo, to wa&s;h, pro|perly implies dipping, and not &s;prinkling or affu&s;ion. But this can never be made to appear, and we have plain evidence to the contrary. The wa&s;hing of Polycrates' face with the rain is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by this word
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodotus.</NOTE>. So is the wa&s;hing the apo&s;tles &s;tripes by the jailor; which cannot be thought to have been done by dip|ping them under water, but by the affu&s;ion of &s;ome proper Bath. The &s;ame word is u&s;ed to expre&s;s Chri&s;t's wa&s;hing us from our &s;ins in his own blood. But the application of Chri&s;t's blood for our purification is always expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;prinkling of it, never by our being dipped in it. In the 51&s;t P&s;alm, according to the Greet ver&s;ion&mdash;the&s;e words in v. 2. Wa&s;h me from mine ini|quity and clean&s;e me from my &s;in; are thus explained in the 7th v. Sprinkle me with hy&s;&s;op and I &s;hall be clean. All which &s;hews that &s;prinkling or affu&s;ion is a Wa&s;hing&mdash;Nor can we conclude from the apo&s;tle's &s;peaking of having our bodies wa&s;hed in pure water, that a dipping the whole body is nece&s;&s;ary, or even a wa&s;hing the whole body in any mode. When Mary poured a box of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">intment on Je&s;us' head he calls it an ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of his body. Nor is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pping required in order to the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h. 1 Pet. iii. 21.

Heb. ix. 13.</P>
<P>But to proceed, The word baptize is u&s;ed in &s;cripture to ex|pre&s;s &s;uch wa&s;hings as did not require, and were not effected by dipping. In Luk. xi. 38. we read, that a Phari&s;ee who had in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ited Je&s;us to dine with him, marve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that he had not fir&s;t Wa&s;hed. The Greek word is Baptized. Here ob&s;erve, that Je&s;us omitted to wa&s;h before dinner according to the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom, which was the rea&s;on why the Phari&s;ee woundered; and that this Wa&s;hing
<PB N="14" REF="017187_0013_0FA071E50C0299A8">was prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly called a Bapti&s;m. But how were the Jews won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ordinarily to wa&s;h before their meals? Did they dip them&s;elves under water? If not, here is a plain proof and example of a wa&s;hing that is called a bapti&s;m, without &s;uch a dipping. Now if we turn to Mark 7th, we &s;hall &s;ee what that wa&s;hing was that was cu&s;tomary among the Jews before eating. <Q>When the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|ri&s;ees and &s;ome of the Scribes &s;aw &s;ome of his di&s;ciples eat bread with defiled, that is to &s;ay, with unwa&s;hen hands, they found fault. For the Phari&s;ees and all the Jews except they wa&s;h their hands oft eat not. And when they come from the market, except they wa&s;h (the Greek is, except they are bap|tized) they eat not.</Q> This &s;hews, that in the language of the new te&s;tament a per&s;on is &s;aid to be baptized, when a &s;mall part of his body is wa&s;hed. It is further to be ob&s;erved, that the word Baptize is here explained by another Greek word (nipto) which &s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifies no more than wa&s;hing in general, and which does not imply d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pping, as all acknowledge; and in this place &s;ignifies no more than the wa&s;hing of the hands. And though the hands may be wa&s;hed by dipping them, yet as this may as well be done by pouring water on them, &s;o the Jews were wont to wa&s;h their hands in this manner, as Dr. Pocock has proved from Jewi&s;h writers: which is al&s;o confirmed by what we read, 2 Kings iii. 11. "That Eli&s;ha poured water on the hands of Elijah," as &s;er|vants were wont to do, when their ma&s;ters wa&s;hed their hands. We &s;ee then that the cu&s;tomary wa&s;hing among the Jews, which is here expre&s;sly called a bapti&s;m, implied no more than pouring water on a &s;mall part of the body: And therefore that the word does not nece&s;&s;arily import a dipping of the whole body, or even of any part.</P>
<P>Again, in Heb. ix. 10. the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the Jewi&s;h ritual as &s;tanding in Divers Wa&s;hings; the Greek is, different Bapti&s;ms. And it appears that purifications by &s;prinkling are e&s;pecially in|tended. For he adds, with a plain reference to, and as an illu&s;|tration of what he had ju&s;t &s;aid: <Q>If the blood of bulls and goats, and the a&s;hes of an he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fer, Sprinkling the unclean &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t,</Q> &amp;c. which &s;hews that the&s;e purifications by &s;prink|ling are in&s;tances of tho&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hings or bapti&s;ms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had mentioned, and indeed &s;ome of the chief in&s;tances: otherwi&s;e it would not have been pertinent to his purpo&s;e to have noticed them on this occa&s;ion. A plain proof that &s;prinkling is a true bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Further, The apo&s;tle &s;ays of the I&s;raelites who came out of Egypt that "they were baptized unto Mo&s;es in the cloud and in the &s;ea." 1 Cor. x. 2. How were they baptized? Certainly they were not dipped&punc; For they went on d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ground through the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which flood is a wall on each hand. It was the Egyptians only that were baptized by immer&s;ion. According to the account Mo&s;es gives, the I&s;ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes could no otherwi&s;e be baptized in the
<PB N="15" REF="017187_0014_0FA071E686461058">cloud and &s;ea, than by being &s;prinkled with rain from the one, and a &s;pray from the other, as they pa&s;&s;ed along: to which P&s;al. lxviii. 7, 8, 9, is thought to refer. Here is then another in&s;tance of bapti&s;m by &s;prinkling; which was a token of the &s;eparation or &s;anctification of the people to God. This gives a natural and ea&s;y account of the matter. But how unnatural and &s;trained is our opponent's way of explaining it: <Q>That the people having the &s;ea on each hand, and the cloud over their heads, &s;eemed to be as it were dipped or enclo&s;ed in water.</Q> On which I would ob|&s;erve, that the apo&s;tle &s;ays not that they &s;eemed to be as it were baptized, but in plain terms that they were Baptized. But what|ever re&s;emblances of dipping people may imagine, immer&s;ion without wetting is certainly no real Bapti&s;m. For whether the mode of wa&s;hing be e&s;&s;ential or not, yet the wa&s;hing or wetting it&s;elf is indeed e&s;&s;ential to a true and proper bapti&s;m. When the word ever &s;ignifies immer&s;ion, yet it is &s;uch an immer&s;ion as in|cludes and nece&s;&s;arily in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers wa&s;hing or wetting being morder to, or for the &s;ake of tinging, or ablution, as is commonly ob&s;erved by the critics. If people may be baptized by having the water round them, though they are not wet by it at all, the dry hold of a &s;hip upon the water would &s;erve as well as Jordan: And by going down into it; we &s;hall be dipped in the &s;ea in like manner as the I&s;raelites were&mdash;What is further &s;aid of the repre&s;entation of a burial and re&s;urrection in their going down into, and coming up out of the &s;ea, is quite impertinent.

Which is another proof that &s;prinkling is a mode of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Let us now confider the words of Chri&s;t. Luk. xii. 50. <Q>I have a bapti&s;m to be baptized with, and how am I &s;traitned till it be accompli&s;hed.</Q> Chri&s;t here calls his &s;ufferings a bapti&s;m. But it &s;eems to me that commentators have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed the true interpretations of the&s;e words. They &s;uppo&s;e the bapti&s;m here &s;poken of is to be taken in a metaphorical, and not a literal &s;en&s;e. Hence &s;ome have argued in fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our of the mode of dipping as mo&s;t fitly expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, who was plunged and &s;unk in angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s. Others argue as well and fairly in favour of the mode of affu&s;ion, as expre&s;&s;ive of the pouring out the cur&s;e of God, and the vials of his wrath due to our &s;ins upon Chri&s;t the atoning &s;acrifice. Thus people explain the &s;uppo&s;ed metaphor, according to their different views. But, methinks, the plain literal &s;en&s;e is more apt and natural, than ei|ther of the&s;e far fetched interpretations. The &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed body of
<PB N="16" REF="017187_0015_0FA071E691A10020">the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was truly and literally baptized&mdash;He was wet and bathed in his own tears, and &s;weat, and blood, in his agony in the garden, and when he was &s;courged, and nailed to the cro&s;s. He was baptized and &s;anctified by the blood of the covenant, Heb. x. 29. that is, by his own blood; even as the Jewi&s;h high prie&s;ts were baptized, &s;anctified, and con&s;ecrated with water and the blood of bea&s;ts, as types of Chri&s;t. And accordingly it was a com|mon expre&s;&s;ion of the antient fathers, concerning the martyrs, who had &s;hed their blood in bearing witne&s;s to the Chri&s;tian faith, that they were baptized with their own blood.&mdash;Here is then, I think, another very good proof, that dipping is no ways o&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m.&mdash;For, Chri&s;t was not dipped, and his martyrs are not dipped in their bloody bapti&s;m; but he was wet, and tinged, and bathed in his &s;weat, and blood i&s;&s;uing from his pores and veins.</P>
<P>Let us now make &s;ome remarks on the bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, which is often &s;poken of. This is indeed a figurative bapti&s;m, by which the &s;ubjects of it were &s;anctified, con&s;ecrated and &s;eparated to God, in a higher and more eminent &s;en&s;e, than tho&s;e were who had only been con&s;ecrated by water bapti&s;m. But how is this &s;piritual bapti&s;m explained? There are &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions which are plainly of the &s;ame import: &s;uch as the "pouring out of the &s;pirit" upon the &s;ubject. When the Apo&s;tles were baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, according to Chri&s;t's promi&s;e, Acts i. 5. Peter ob&s;erves, that this was the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel, "It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days, &s;aith God, I will pour out of my &s;pirit." Acts ii. 17. and again ver. 33. <Q>That Chri&s;t being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, he hath &s;hed or poured forth tho&s;e things which ye now &s;ee and hear
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This entirely overthrows that &s;trange conceit advanced by Dr. Gill, That the bapti&s;m of the Apo&s;tles with the Holy Gho&s;t, means their being dipped into the Holy Gho&s;t, which filled the hou&s;e where they were met. But Peter &s;ays, It was by a pouring out, or &s;hedding forth of the Spirit upon them, that they were then baptized.</NOTE>.</Q> Here we &s;ee "that pouring upon," and baptizing are &s;ynonimous expre&s;&s;ions. The one explains the other. Now if the pouring out of the &s;pirit be the bapti&s;m of the &s;pirit, the pouring of water mu&s;t al&s;o be a bapti&s;m of water.&mdash;It is to be well ob&s;erved, that as the Holy Spirit is in &s;cripture often &s;ignified by water, as a fit emblem of his &s;anctifying and comforting influences; &s;o the conferring of the &s;pirit upon us, which is undoubtedly the true intendment of the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, is not repre&s;ented by the &s;imilitude of dipping into water, but as a pouring or &s;prinkling of water upon us&mdash;I&s;a. xliv. 3. <Q>I will pour waters on the thir&s;ty, and floods on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit on thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing on thine offspring.</Q> See al&s;o, Ezek. xxxvi. 27.<Q>I
<PB N="17" REF="017187_0016_0FA071E74D412488">will &s;prinkle clean water on you, and ye &s;hall be clear. A new heart will I give you,</Q> &amp;c. All which I think proves plainly, that &s;prinkling is in &s;cripture con&s;idered as a mode of bapti&s;m.&mdash; I will add one remark more. The bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is termed, an unction or anointing, 1 John ii. 20, 27. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> holy oil, with which per&s;ons were anointed in their con&s;ecration, was a &s;ign or emblem of the Holy Spirit given to them, to fit them for the offices to which they were called. The &s;ame is al&s;o &s;ignified by Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m. Now, it is by pouring on of oil that per|&s;ons are anointed; and it is by pouring out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit upon us, that our anointing or bapti&s;m with the Holy G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t is expre&s;&s;ed. As therefore bapti&s;m an&s;wers in &s;ignification to anointing, we may well conclude, that it may properly be admini&s;tred in the &s;ame way, that is by affu&s;ion. Can we doubt whether affu&s;ion be a true bapti&s;m, when we find that in &s;cripture, Baptizing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouring Sprinkling, and Anointing, are parallel, and &s;ignify the &s;ame thing&punc;</P>
<P>The word baptize occurs but once that I remember in the Greek ver&s;ion of the old te&s;tament, 2 Kings v. 14. Our la&s;t En|gli&s;h tran&s;lation renders the place, "He dipped him&s;elf in Jordan." But there is nothing in the account that determines in what man|ner this wa&s;hing was performed. In the older Engli&s;h bibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the place is rendred "He wa&s;hed him&s;elf in Jordan," which divers learned men have preferred, and which was what the Prophet di|rected to ver. 10. without pre&s;cribing the mode. But it is wor|thy of particular remark, that the word Bapto whence baptize is derived, and which is of like &s;ignification, this word is u&s;ed by the Greek tran&s;lators to expre&s;s the wetting of Nebuchadnez|zar's body with the dew of heaven; which could not mean a dipping, but a &s;prinkling&mdash;Indeed wetting &s;eems to be the ge|nuine &s;ignification which this word con&s;tantly bears throughout the old and new te&s;tament.</P>
<P>One remark more I will add. In all the different tran&s;lations of the new te&s;tament that I have &s;een, I have not found that the word Baptizo in the original is ever rendered by a word &s;igni|fying or implying immer&s;ion. But they either retain the origi|nal word, or render it wa&s;hing or ablution: which we cannot think they would have done, if the authors had not been &s;atis|fied that this is the true &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, however the word is u&s;ed in heathen writers.</P>
<P>And we find accordingly, that the ancient fathers did often u&s;e the word Bapti&s;m to expre&s;s a wetting when there was no dip|ping. They &s;peak of the bapti&s;m of Clinicks and others, as ad|mini&s;tered by &s;prinkling, and allow it to be a valid bapti&s;m.&mdash; The Latins too did commonly term a baptized per&s;on Tinctus, wet or tinged, a word which no more implies dipping than affu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. They &s;peak of the martyrs as baptized with their own blood:&mdash;which could not mean immer&s;ion, as has been noted. And finally, they &s;peak of penitents as baptized with the bap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="18" REF="017187_0017_0FA071E80D904A40">of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which certainly could not intend their being dipped in them, but only wet with weeping&mdash;The&s;e things are a &s;uffici|ent proof that the&s;e ancient writers under&s;tood the word in that large and general &s;en&s;e, which I have &s;hewn is the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e&mdash;And upon the whole, to imagine that dipping only is bapti&s;m, is a groundle&s;s and mi&s;taken notion. And is confuted by the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and mo&s;t unexceptionable authorities and by in|conte&s;tible in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">riptures and the ancient chri&s;tian writers.</P>
<P>To find and a &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtain the &s;ignification of the word, will, I think, determine the di&s;pute concerning the mode of Bapti&s;m. For which rea&s;on, I have examined the matter the more carefully. And the conclu&s;ion in which this enquiry has i&s;&s;ued, will not be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> weakened, but rather much confirmed by the account we have in the &s;criptures of the admini&s;tration of this ordinance. And this leads us to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping can be argued from the&s;e &s;criptural precedents. Some &s;uppo&s;e, that <Q>John Bapti&s;t and the apo&s;tles baptized by immer&s;ion only: And that we are bound herein &s;trictly to follow their example.</Q> On the contrary, we can find no certainty that immer&s;ion was ever practi&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic age. It is morally certain that this was not the con&s;tant mode of admini&s;tration. And whether it was practi&s;ed or not, there is no rea&s;on for in&s;i&s;ting that this mode is either nece&s;&s;ary or mo&s;t expedient&mdash;to be con&s;tantly ob&s;erved by us.</P>
<P>As I am far from calling in que&s;tion the lawfulne&s;s of bap|tizing by immer&s;ion, I would not be under&s;tood in a&s;&s;erting, or undertaking to prove, that the apo&s;tles did not baptize in this manner, in &s;ome in&s;tances. But this may truly be &s;aid, that it does not certainly appear whether they did or not. That bap|ti&s;m wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in any one in&s;tance admini&s;tred by dipping, the &s;crip|ture &s;aith not; nor can it certainly be gathered from the ac|counts we have given us. And if &s;ome circum&s;tances that are related may &s;eem to favour the probability that immer&s;ion might &s;ometimes be practi&s;ed, they are perhaps at lea&s;t fully balanced by probable arguments to the contrary. The matter is indeed of &s;o very little importance, that it would not be worth while to &s;pend time in examining the in&s;tances alledged, did not &s;ome lay great &s;tre&s;s upon them. 'Tis true, we read that Je&s;us was baptized by John in Jordan; and then came up out of the water. Mark. i. 9, 10. "That the Jews were al&s;o baptized of John in Jordan." Mat. iii. 6. "That John baptized in Enon, becau&s;e there was much water." John i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 23. <Q>That the Eunuch went down into the water with P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, and when he was baptized they came up out of the water.</Q> Acts viii 38, 39. But whe|ther any of the&s;e were dipped is uncertain. It is not even cer|tain whether any of the&s;e in&s;tances went into and were baptized,
<PB N="19" REF="017187_0018_0FA071E8CC0D1158">in the water; though the texts are &s;o rendered in our Engli&s;h bible. But the Greek, which is the authentic &s;tandard will fairly admit of this &s;en&s;e, as critics have often ob&s;erved, viz. That they went down to, were baptized at, and went up from the wa|ter
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Greek text does not determine whether Je&s;us and the Jews were baptized in Jordan or only at Jordan for the parti|cles (en and els) here u&s;ed, &s;ignifying, in, at, or to. See Rom. viii. 34, (en). At the right hand of God, Nor is it certain that the Eunuch went into the water. The parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e (eis) is often ren|dred, to. John xx. 4. The other di&s;ciple came fir&s;t (eis) to the &s;epulchre, yet went he not in. Phillip and the Eunuch went up (ek) from the water: So the particle is el&s;ewhere rendered. See Mat. xii. 42. The queen of the &s;outh came (ek) from the utter|mo&s;t ends of the earth. Je&s;us when he was baptized went up (apo) from the water; as the phra&s;e mo&s;t properly &s;ignifies. I do not ment on the&s;e things as faulting our Engli&s;h tran&s;lation. All that I aim at is, that the original may fairly be rendered either way: and that this circum&s;tance, as it is immaterial, &s;o it is left un|determined.</NOTE>. But waving this remark, &s;uppo&s;ing they did go into the water, and were there baptized; it does not follow that they were plunged. It is nothing &s;trange or improbable if they &s;tep|ped into the water, that they might be baptized by affu&s;ion. Though there was much water, or many waters, (as the phra&s;e properly &s;ignifies) at Enon, where John was baptizing. This is no proof that he dipped, or made u&s;e of much water in bapti&s;m, or that there was even a convenient depth of water for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. Travellers have reported that there are only &s;prings and &s;mall rivulets to be found in this place. As multitudes re&s;orted to John, a place that was well &s;upplied with water, for their u&s;e and refre&s;hment would be mo&s;t convenient, &s;uppo&s;e none of them were dipped, as I find no certainty that they were. And if any &s;hould think that the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m at rivers, and in places where there was plenty of water, is a circum&s;tance that favours immer&s;ion, though it is needle&s;s to conte&s;t this point, yet we might ea&s;ily mention &s;everal things as probable argu|ments that immer&s;ion was not practi&s;ed in the&s;e in&s;tances. It &s;eems unlikely that mixed multitudes of both &s;exes &s;hould be dipped naked. And it was contrary to the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom to bathe with any of their clothes on; in which re&s;pect they were &s;o &s;trict, that they held a per&s;on to be unclean, if but the top of one of his fingers were covered, when he bathed him&s;elf for his clean|&s;ing&mdash;Or if immer&s;ion were received with the clothes on, this would require a &s;hifting of apparel, which we have no hint of. Nor can we ea&s;ily conceive how &s;trangers, who came from home with|out any de&s;ign of being baptized, as was the ca&s;e with &s;ome, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary change of raiment for this
<PB N="20" REF="017187_0019_0FA071E98BCE2FB0">purpo&s;e. Or how John &s;hould be able, without a miracle, to bear the hard&s;hip of &s;tanding in the water up to his wai&s;t a great part of his time, to dip the multitudes that came to him. The&s;e c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|cum&s;tances mu&s;t &s;urely weaken, if not overballance, all proba|bilities or pre&s;umptions that can be pleaded in favour of immer|&s;ion, in the&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>But be this as it may, we may be morally certain, that immer|&s;ion was not only con&s;tantly practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles in the admi|ni&s;tration of bapti&s;m. We have accounts of &s;everal in&s;tances, &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being dipped is mo&s;t incredible. Particularly the 3000 baptized on the day of Pen|teco&s;t. For it was at lea&s;t nine o'clock when Peter began his &s;er|mon. After this he had a long conference, and with many words coun&s;elled, te&s;tified, and exhorted them. Then the apo&s;tles had to receive a confe&s;&s;ion of faith from each of them di&s;tinctly; and then baptize them &s;everally: Which, though done in the quick|e&s;t manner, would require the whole remainder of the day. But in the flower way of immer&s;ion, we cannot conceive how it could be done by the apo&s;tles without a miracle. Nor may we &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tles were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this work by the &s;eventy di&s;ci|ples, who appear not to have been authorized to admini&s;ter the ordinances. Be&s;ides, how incredible is it, that they &s;hould on a &s;udden find conveniences for dipping &s;o many, in the mid&s;t of a city, among zealous oppo&s;ers; or that &s;o many &s;trangers &s;hould either be baptized naked, or have change of raiment. We cannot rationally think, that they could be baptized otherwi&s;e than by affu&s;ion. Nor is it probable that Paul was baptized by immer|&s;ion: For, upon Ananias coming in to him, putting his hands upon him, &amp;c. we read, that he immediately received his fight, aro&s;e and was baptized; that is, in the hou&s;e where he was: there being no hint of his going out to any water, weak as he was with long fa&s;ting and agitation of mind
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 17, 18. Note, Paul was baptized without a profe&s;|&s;ion of faith, upon Chri&s;t's te&s;timony concerning him, that he was a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el. The te&s;timony of Chri&s;t, that the infants of be|lievers are of the kingdom of heaven, are holy, are intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, is as good a warrant for baptizing them without a profe&s;&s;ion of their faith.</NOTE>. It is not probable that tho&s;e were dipped who were baptized at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, Acts x. 47. Peter &s;eeing them filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;aid, "Can any man forbid water, that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized." The natural &s;en&s;e is, Can any forbid water to be brought or pro|vided to baptize the&s;e: not, whether any could forbid their go|ing to the water. And, in the account of their bapti&s;m, there is no hint of their going from the hou&s;e. It is highly improbable, that the jailor and his hou&s;e were baptized by immer&s;ion; for, this was done in the night, and in the pri&s;on, where there was no
<PB N="21" REF="017187_0020_0FA071EA4D6F4908">river or pool to be imagined. Can it be thought, that the jailor, with his whole family, and his pri&s;oners, whom he was charged to keep at his peril, &s;hould at &s;uch an hour, grope away in the dark, or go with a lanthorn or torch to a river or pool, no one knows where, and that through a city, ju&s;t waked up with a great earthquake, and the &s;treets, it is probable, filled with the frighted citizens? They might all well expect to be taken up and puni&s;h|ed for helping the pri&s;oners to make their e&s;cape. Nor is it credi|ble that the apo&s;tles would have done &s;uch a thing; who would not leave the pri&s;on till the magi&s;trates took them out. The ad|mini&s;tration of bapti&s;m would, doubtle&s;s, have been deferred, if it could not then have been attended without all this difficulty and danger. Be&s;ides, there is no account of their going out to the water, or leaving the pri&s;on. The hou&s;e of the jailor, into which he brought the apo&s;tles, &s;eems to have been a &s;eparate apartment of the building, where the keeper dwelt, that he might conveni|ently attend his charge. And we may here make this general remark; that among all the in&s;tances of bapti&s;m mentioned in the New Te&s;tament, it is never &s;aid or intimated, that they went from the place where they happened to be, to any river or &s;tream, that they might be baptized in or at it. But all who are &s;aid to have been baptized in any &s;tream were by it, when they fir&s;t of|fered them&s;elves to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we have much more evidence that dipping was not con&s;tantly practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, in the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m, than we have that it was practi&s;ed by them at all. But, if after all, it &s;hould &s;eem to any, that this was the mode in which the apo&s;tles commonly admini&s;tered the ordinance, it would be no proof that they di&s;approved the mode of &s;prinkling; any more than the common practice of &s;prinkling among us is an argument that we di&s;allow of dipping. The apo&s;tles might have good rea|&s;ons, in compliance with the cu&s;toms or inclinations of the fir&s;t converts, to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m in &s;uch a mode as is neither ne|ce&s;&s;ary nor mo&s;t expedient for us. But whether they did or not, the mode is a circum&s;tance in which we are left at liberty. For, it is not any particular Manner of baptizing that is enjoined up|on us, but it is Bapti&s;m it&s;elf, in whatever way we find mo&s;t con|venient. And that &s;prinkling is a true and proper bapti&s;m, in the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e of the word, has been &s;hewn before. Again,</P>
<P>Thirdly, The nece&s;&s;ity of immer&s;ion is argued from the apo&s;|tle's words, Rom. vi. 4. "We are buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m." Which words have been &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to this mode of bury|ing the &s;ubject in water. But it does not appear that any &s;uch reference or allu&s;ion is here intended. The apo&s;tle is here &s;hew|ing, that "Chri&s;tians may not live any longer in &s;in, ina&s;much as they are dead to it." To prove and illu&s;trate this, he reminds us of our being "baptized into Chri&s;t." By bapti&s;m, we are not only dedicated to Chri&s;t, and brought into a &s;pecial relation to
<PB N="22" REF="017187_0021_0FA071EB0BE716B0">him as his di&s;ciples; but, our bapti&s;m is the outward &s;ign of our in|grafting into Chri&s;t, and &s;o of our &s;piritual union to him, and com|munion with him, in the benefits obtained for the members of his body, by his crucifixion, death, burial and re&s;urrection; and al&s;o of our obligation to a &s;piritual conformity to his crucifixion, death, burial and re&s;urrection, as is noted and illu&s;trated in what follows. Being thus <Q>baptized into Chri&s;t, we are baptized in|to his death.</Q> We not only participate of the benefits obtain|ed by his death, but are bound to a &s;piritual conformity to him in his crucifixion and death; by the crucifixion and death of our old man, with its affections and lu&s;ts. <Q>Therefore we are buri|ed with him by bapti&s;m into death.</Q> Bapti&s;m &s;ignifies our u|nion and communion with Chri&s;t; and our profe&s;&s;ion and obliga|tion to a conformity to him, "in his burial," as well as his cru|cifixion, and death. The old man, with his deeds, mu&s;t be put off, utterly rejected and buried. We mu&s;t, in re&s;pect of our for|mer lu&s;ts and conver&s;ation, be as if we were "dead and buried." We, in our bapti&s;m, profe&s;s and are obliged to have done with the&s;e things; to endeavour, that the body of &s;in may be quite mortified and de&s;troyed. But this work of mortification, in which "we are made conformable to Chri&s;t's death," is in order to a &s;piritual re&s;urrection; in conformity to the example, and by the quickening virtue of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection: <Q>That like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the glory of the Father, &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life.</Q> So that according to the apo&s;tle, bapti&s;m imports our union and conformity to Chri&s;t in his crucifixion, death and re&s;urrection, as well as in his burial. And why bapti&s;m &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear an outward re&s;em|blance of his burial, rather than of his crucifixion and death, or why any &s;hould fancy an allu&s;ion to the mode of immer&s;ion, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I might further ob&s;erve, that dipping a per&s;on in water does not re&s;emble the burial of Chri&s;t, who was not laid in a common grave, but in a tomb hewn out of the fide of a rock, into which they entered by a door. Nor does it re&s;emble a common burial, which is not &s;o properly the letting down the body into the grave, as the ca&s;ting in the earth upon it; of which the &s;prinkling or pouring of water on a per&s;on is no unfit repre&s;entation; but dipping bears no re&s;emblance to it. It has al&s;o been noted, that it was anciently a common practice at funerals to pour ointment on the dead body, of which the pouring of water in bapti&s;m is a good re&s;emblance; but there is nothing like it in dipping. How|ever, I lay but little &s;tre&s;s upon the&s;e things. The truth is, bap|ti&s;m does not appear to have been de&s;igned for a repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t's burial and re&s;urrection. It is the application of the benefits of redemption to Chri&s;tians, that is mainly &s;ignified in this &s;acrament. And it is not an outward, but a &s;piritual con|formity to Chri&s;t's death and burial that is intended by our being buried with him in bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="017187_0022_0FA071EBCBA92738">
But, admitting that the mode of immer&s;ion may here be al|luded to, nothing more could be fairly argued from it, than that immer&s;ion is a lawful way of baptizing, and was not unknown and unpracti&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic age. But, does this prove any thing again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of &s;prinkling? Does an allu&s;ion to the one mode imply a di&s;approbation of the other? If probable allu&s;ions are &s;ufficient evidence in the ca&s;e, this argument may be improv|ed in favour of &s;prinkling with equal advantage. See Heb. x. 22, 23. "Having our hearts &s;prinkled," that is, baptized or purified &s;piritually, <Q>from an evil con&s;cience, and our bodies wa&s;hed with pure water,</Q> that is, baptized externally, <Q>let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith,</Q> &s;ealed in our bapti&s;m. Matth. iii. 11. "I baptize you with water," or pour water upon you, "but he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t," or pour the Spirit upon you. Tit. iii. 5. <Q>According to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t, which he &s;hed or poured upon us.</Q> By the wa&s;hing of regeneration, many under&s;tand bapti&s;m, the go&s;pel &s;acrament of regeneration; others under&s;tand the grace of regeneration, of which bapti&s;m is the in&s;tituted &s;acramental &s;ign. It is, however, called a wa&s;hing, in allu&s;ion to the rite of bapti&s;m; and therein the Spirit is &s;aid to be &s;hed or poured forth, in allu&s;ion to the af|fu&s;ion of water in the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m. The allu&s;ion to the mode of &s;prinkling or affu&s;ion, is, I think, at lea&s;t as pro|bable in the&s;e texts, as the allu&s;ion to dipping is in any texts that can be found. The conclu&s;ion then mu&s;t be, that both ways of baptizing are lawful, and were practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, and this we freely agree to. If our opponents will do the &s;ame, the di&s;|pute is at an end.</P>
<P>Let us now enquire, fourthly, Whether dipping an&s;wers to and repre&s;ents the thing &s;ignified in Bapti&s;m better than &s;prinkling. It has ju&s;t been ob&s;erved, that Bapti&s;m is the outward &s;ign and token of the application of the benefits of redemption to believers, in their ju&s;tification, and &s;anctification. <Q>Chri&s;t wa&s;hes us from our &s;ins in his own blood.</Q> And Bapti&s;m, as the outward &s;ign of the application of Chri&s;t's blood, is, <Q>for the wa&s;hing away of &s;ins.</Q> But how is the application of Chri&s;t's blood for our clean&s;ing repre&s;ented? It is called, "the blood of &s;prinkling." And the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the <Q>&s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> But we are never &s;aid to be clean&s;ed from &s;in by be|ing dipped into the blood of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Again, Bapti&s;m is the in&s;ti|tuted &s;ign of our having the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t be&s;towed upon us. "Be baptized," &s;ays Peter, <Q>and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> Now, the donation of the Holy Gho&s;t is ne|ver expre&s;&s;ed by our being dipped into the Holy Gho&s;t; but by his being poured out, and our being &s;prinkled thereby; which is called our being baptized with the Spirit. Sprinkling is there|fore a more apt repre&s;entation of the application of the blood of
<PB N="24" REF="017187_0023_0FA071EC8C403330">Chri&s;t, and the influences of the Spirit, for the clean&s;ing of our &s;ouls from &s;in. The argument, therefore, from the analogy of the &s;ign with the thing &s;ignified, is plainly in favour of &s;prinkling, rather than dipping. It is true, our &s;piritual conformity to Chri&s;t in his death and re&s;urrection is not unfitly &s;ignified by immer&s;ion. But &s;prinkling more aptly repre&s;ents the application of the bene|fits of redemption to us; which is the main thing &s;ignified by bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Fifthly, We will now con&s;ider, whether any thing can be ar|gued in favour of the nece&s;&s;ity of immer&s;ion, from the practice of the ancient church, who it is &s;aid, generally baptized in this way. As to the apo&s;tolic age, we have no expre&s;s account in what mode bapti&s;m was then admini&s;tred; but it is morally certain, as has been &s;hewn, that immer&s;ion was not the con&s;tant practice. And though it appears that this mode afterwards became very cu&s;tomary, and was generally preferred; yet it was never held to be nece&s;&s;ary. Sprinkling was u&s;ed all along upon occa|&s;ion: as in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, and when dipping was inconvenient
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bapti&s;m of Clinicks, which was admini&s;tred in the pri|mitive church by Sprinkling has been before mentioned. Ter|tullian too refers to this mode of bapti&s;m, when he &s;ays, Speak|ing to an impenitent per&s;on, <Q>who will afford thee one &s;prink|ling of water (a&s;perginem unam cujullibet aquae) for bapti&s;m.</Q> And of Laurence the martyr, contemporary with Cyprian, we are told, that he baptized a Roman &s;oldier with a pitcher of wa|ter. And al&s;o, that he baptized one Lucillus pouring water on his head. Athana&s;ius too, &s;peaking of tho&s;e who were baptized by Heretics, &s;ays, "They who are &s;prinkled by them are further defiled by a corrupt religion, than redeemed." 3d. Oration again&s;t the Arians. To this it may be added, (what I have &s;ome|where read) that the ancients when they had dipped a per&s;on, were wont to apply water to his face. From all which, and much more that might be produced, it appears that the mode of &s;prink|ling was practi&s;ed, and allowed in the primitive church.</NOTE>. We have plainly then the judgment and practi&s;e of the primi|tive church on our &s;ide, that &s;prinkling is a true and valid bap|ti&s;m; and that dipping is not e&s;&s;ential. We do not indeed think our&s;elves bound to follow the judgment and practice of the an|cients in preferring and generally practi&s;ing immer&s;ion, for which we find no good rea&s;on. Nor have our opponents any rea&s;on to blame us for this; &s;ince they too have taken the liberty to de|part very far from the practice and cu&s;tom of the ancients. They knew nothing of the modern cu&s;tom of dipping people in their clothes. They held it as nece&s;&s;ary that the per&s;ons be &s;tript na|ked, as that they &s;hould be dipped. And they thought there was an important &s;ignificancy in this rite, importing the "put|ting off the old man with his deeds." After bapti&s;m, the per&s;on
<PB N="25" REF="017187_0024_0FA071EDF0545850">was clothed with white garments, &s;ignifying the "putting on Chri&s;t, or the new man." And &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed that the apo&s;tle in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions alludes to this cu&s;tom of &s;tripping and clothing in the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m: A &s;uppo&s;ition of like probability, I conceive, as that our being "buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m," alludes to dipping&mdash;Many other &s;ignificant rites they had; &s;uch as trine immer&s;ion, exorci&s;m, breathing on the per|&s;on, anointing him with oil, &amp;c. The&s;e rites and ceremonies, though generally ob&s;erved by the ancients, our opponents reject. And we have as good a right to u&s;e our liberty, as to the mode of bapti&s;m, whatever the ancient cu&s;tom might be.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, <Q>that the&s;e rites are improper, and favour of &s;uper&s;tition, which cannot be &s;aid of immer&s;ion.</Q> I an&s;wer, though I believe that immer&s;ion may be admini&s;tred, and receiv|ed without &s;uper&s;tition; yet a preferring of immer&s;ion to &s;prink|ling, as being a more valid, efficacious or perfect bapti&s;m, does, I think, really &s;avour of &s;uper&s;tition. And as it is certain that &s;uper&s;titious opinions and practices were early received in the church, particularly with re&s;pect to bapti&s;m; &s;o it &s;eems to have been owing to &s;uper&s;tition that dipping was originally preferred to &s;prinkling. Religious purifications, by wa&s;hing with water, were common among both Jews and Gentiles. In the&s;e it was cu&s;tomary, as we are informed, that the per&s;on be &s;tripped naked, and his whole body bathed. Now it &s;eems very probable, that many converts to chri&s;tianity, not altogether clear of tho&s;e &s;u|per&s;titious conceits, which they had imbibed from Judai&s;m and Gentili&s;m, might imagine, that there was &s;ome natural virtue in the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, like what they had been wont to conceive was in the lu&s;trations they had formerly practi&s;ed: and that its puri|fying efficacy would be greater if they were dipped, than if they were only &s;prinkled, greater if they were baptized naked, than in their clothes. The better in&s;tructed chri&s;tians might think it be&s;t to conde&s;cend to their prejudices, and bear the in|firmities of the weak, in order to gain them over to the chri&s;tian faith, and profe&s;&s;ion: And &s;o by degrees that mode of bapti&s;m, which mo&s;t re&s;embled the&s;e lu&s;trations, came to be generally prac|ti&s;ed; and a &s;uper&s;titious notion of its greater fitne&s;s and effica|cy unto the proper ends of bapti&s;m was bred in the minds of many. Jewi&s;h and heatheni&s;h rites were adoped, and a chri&s;tian &s;ignificancy put upon them. The cu&s;tom of receiving bapti&s;m naked, we all agree, was not of divine in&s;titution. It &s;eems plain|ly to have &s;prung from Jewi&s;h and Gentile &s;uper&s;tition. And from the &s;ame &s;ource it was, as we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that dipping came to be &s;o much practi&s;ed in the ancient church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for we find that &s;tripping and dipping con&s;tantly went together, and the one was thought as nece&s;&s;ary as the other.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t probable account, why immer&s;ion was &s;o much practi&s;ed in the third and following centuries; for
<PB N="26" REF="017187_0025_0FA071EE0C808BD8">till then, I find not whether bapti&s;m was generally admini&s;tred in this mode. But however this may be, the ancient fathers agreed with us that &s;prinkling was a true and valid bapti&s;m; and that immer&s;ion was not e&s;&s;ential, Let this be granted, and &s;u|per&s;tition avoided, and we plead for no more.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND PART. On the SUBJECTS of BAPTISM.</HEAD>

<P>THE &s;econd part of the argument in hand, was to con&s;ider who are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, or to whom this or|dinance is to be admini&s;tred. It is to be ob&s;erved that a per&s;on may be con&s;idered as being a proper &s;ubject of bapti&s;m in two re&s;pects; that is, either really, and in the fight of God, or vi&s;ibly, and in the account of the church, judging according to the rules of the go&s;pel. No one ought to offer him&s;elf to bapti&s;m, while he is really and in the fight of God unmeet for it. But the church are to admit all tho&s;e who according to the rules of the go&s;pel, appear to them to be proper &s;ubjects, whether they are indeed &s;uch as they appear to be or not. It is none of our concern to &s;earch the hearts of men. The tree is to be judged of by the fruits which are vi&s;ible. If hypocrites feign them&s;elves to be believers and &s;aints, and no|thing appears to the church but that they may be &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ion, they are to be received as believers. Thus Ananias, Sapphira, Simon Magus, and many others, were received into the church; notwith&s;tanding their hearts were not right before God. We have no rea&s;on to perplex our&s;elves with &s;urmi&s;es, that the church is defiled by having clo&s;e hypocrites in its bo&s;om. If none are admitted, or &s;uffered to remain in its communion, un|le&s;s they be &s;uch as by rule of the go&s;pel are vi&s;ible &s;aints, we &s;hall never be blamed by Chri&s;t. This rule, duly ob&s;erved, will keep the church as pure as Chri&s;t de&s;igned it &s;hould be in this world.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent enquiry, concerning the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, is not &s;o much, Who are really &s;uch in the fight of God? but, Who they are that, according to the go&s;pel rule, are to be admitted by the church? In an&s;wer to which, we &s;ay, that all who make a cre|dible
<PB N="27" REF="017187_0026_0FA071EECE1D1D08">profe&s;&s;ion of faith, are proper &s;ubjects, together with their infants, or children in minority. It is agreed, that profe&s;&s;ed be|lievers are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m: And that this ordinance is not to be admini&s;tred to one of adult age, unle&s;s he has in &s;ome manner made a credible profe&s;&s;ion of faith. But that the infants of mem|bers of the vi&s;ible church are to be received as members al&s;o, and as the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, has been denied by &s;ome; and the admini&s;tring the ordinance to &s;uch infants, has been cen&s;ured as irregular, unwarrantable, of no validity or advantage.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore endeavour to prove and vindicate the <Q>divine right of infant bapti&s;m,</Q> as briefly and plainly as I can; leav|ing out tho&s;e collateral que&s;tions, which have often been di&s;|cu&s;ed by tho&s;e who have undertaken to treat this &s;ubject at large. By means of the&s;e the lines of defence have been &s;o enlarged, and the argument has become &s;o complicated that many are lo&s;t in it, not being able to comprehend it, and carry it in mind.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, I &s;hall, fir&s;t, repre&s;ent the chief and plaine&s;t rea&s;on, upon which I believe infant bapti&s;m to be a divine ordinance.&mdash; Then I will confider the principal ob|jections that are made to it&mdash;after which I may add &s;ome brief reflections and remarks on the whole.</P>
<P>But before I enter on the proof of the point before us, let it be ob&s;erved and remembered&mdash;That there is nothing po&s;itive in the New Te&s;tament again&s;t infant bapti&s;m. It is no where &s;aid or hinted, that the Apo&s;tles forbid or refu&s;ed, or declined to bap|ti&s;e infants; or that any child of a believer was, after he was grown up, baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ac|knowledged, that infants are capable not only of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ward fign of bapti&s;m, but al&s;o of having an intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ings and Grace of the New Covenant, and coming under its bonds, which is the thing &s;ignified in the ordinance, and that they need tho&s;e New Covenant ble&s;&s;ings. Further, It is no where declared in &s;cripture, either in expre&s;s, or equivalent terms, that "adult per|&s;ons only," or that "none but tho&s;e who believe" or profe&s;s faith, are to be baptized. In &s;hort, there is ab&s;olutely and per|fectly nothing that &s;tands in the way of our embracing, the doc|tring of infant bapti&s;m, if we can find any kind of evidence in favour of it, either expre&s;s or con&s;equential&mdash;This then is what we have now to enquire into viz. Whether any &s;uch evidence appears? And I think enough may be collected from the &s;criptures to put the matter beyond all rea&s;onable doubt.</P>
<P>And my fir&s;t argument is taken from the church member&s;hip of infants. All tho&s;e who are to be received as members of the vi&s;ible church are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m&mdash;But the infants of the members of the vi&s;ible church, are to be received as members of the vi&s;ible church. They are therefore &s;ubjects of Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I &s;ay that all who are to be received as members of the vi&s;ible church are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. This is granted by
<PB N="28" REF="017187_0027_0FA071EF8C809790">our opponents, particularly by Dr. Gill mo&s;t expre&s;sly. <Q>Let it be proved,</Q> &s;ays he <Q>that infants are or ought to be men|bers of Go&s;pel churches&mdash;and we &s;hall readily admit them,</Q> i. e. to bapti&s;m.&mdash;An&s;wer to Dickin&s;on. p. 89.</P>
<P>Some have pretended "that it is incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;ay, that a right to bapti&s;m is grounded upon church member&s;hip, and yet that we are admitted into the church by bapti&s;m." But this is a mere cavil. The right of church member&s;hip is one thing; and admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church is another. They who are qualified for admi&s;&s;ion into the church, according, to the rule of the go&s;pel, are members by right, before they are members by admi&s;&s;ion. And they are accordingly to be received as right|ful members by bapti&s;m, and &s;o admitted in an orderly way to tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent privileges of chri&s;tian communion, to which bapti&s;m is a regular and &s;olemn introduction. For the right of church member&s;hip, though it gives an immediate claim to ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the church by bapti&s;m, yet it does not give an im|mediate and orderly claim to any, while unbaptized, to all the privileges of admitted and baptized members. The in&s;tituted on|der of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e is not to be neglected.&mdash;If any one &s;hould come, and a&s;k for admi&s;&s;ion into a family as a &s;ervant, and pro|duce the appointed token from the ma&s;ter, that he has taken him into his &s;ervice; &s;uch a one is to be looked upon as belonging to the family, and is accordingly to be admitted. But if the orders of the hou&s;e require that he fir&s;t put on the badge, and livery of a &s;ervant, before he come to the table, then this order mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved. He has a right, as belonging to the family, to &s;it at the table; but he ought to come according to order. The ca&s;e is plain enough, if men would not make difficulties where there are none. But be this as it will, whether the right of church mem|ber&s;hip be antecedent to bapti&s;m, or bapti&s;m be antecedent to church member&s;hip, it cannot be denied that all tho&s;e are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, who are, or ought to be admitted as members of the go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>Now if it can be made to appear, that the infants of church members are, or ought to be acknowledged and admitted as members of the vi&s;ible church, we mu&s;t unavoidably conclude that they are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. And this is what I undertake to prove. And there is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age recorded by three of the Evangeli&s;ts which &s;eems to be &s;ufficient to determine the point. I will recite it at large, collecting all the particulars men|tioned in the &s;everal accounts. Mat. xix. 13-15. Mark x. 13, 16. Luke xviii. 15, 16.&mdash;<Q>And they brought unto him little children, infants, that he &s;hould touch them, put his hands on them, and pray: And his Di&s;ciples rebuked them, i. e. tho&s;e who brought them. But when Je&s;us &s;aw it he was much di&s;|plea&s;ed, and called them to him, and &s;aid unto them, &s;uffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of
<PB N="29" REF="017187_0028_0FA071F04DFD6FA8">&s;uch is the kingdom of Heaven. Verily I &s;ay unto you, who|&s;oever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he &s;hall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put or laid his hands upon them, and ble&s;&s;ed them.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e were young "infant" children which were brought to Chri&s;t, whom he took up in his arms, as we are expre&s;sly told. They who brought them gave evidence of their forth in him: for they brought them that he might put his hands on them and pray.&mdash;They were members of the church and kingdom of God them&s;elves, from which they had not cut them&s;elves off by mani|fe&s;t unbelief&mdash;Whether the&s;e children were their own (as is mo&s;t probable) we need not take upon us to determine. They were without doubt children of the covenant. We may al&s;o, ob&s;erve, that it was agreeable to the mind of Chri&s;t that they &s;hould be brought to him; for when the di&s;ciples rebuked tho&s;e that brought them, Je&s;us &s;eeing it, was much di&s;plea&s;ed. The di&s;po|&s;ition they manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion to de&s;pi&s;e little ones, and &s;et them&s;elves above them, as if young children were not fit to be introduced into their company, Chri&s;t did much di&s;like. And he was al&s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, as it &s;eems, to find that they were &s;o dull of under&s;tanding, and &s;o much mi&s;taken in their apprehen&s;ions. They might rea&s;onably have concluded, that as little children always had been received as members of the church of God, as Chri&s;t had not intimated any de&s;ign to cut them off from this their right, as they needed his ble&s;&s;ing, and were capable of it; on the&s;e grounds they ought to have concluded, that it was fit and proper that they &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the Me&s;&s;iah, the king of I&s;rael, as his di&s;ciples and &s;ubjects, that they might re|ceive his ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;But the di&s;ciples &s;eem to have rea&s;oned in a quite different manner, as &s;ome others have done &s;ince. <Q>To what purpo&s;e is it to bring the&s;e little children hither? They are not capable of being taught. They do not under&s;tand what is intended to be done with them. It will be of no advantage to them. We cannot look upon them to be believers, or fit to belong to our &s;ociety.</Q> Such thoughts as the&s;e they &s;eem to have had. For our Saviour's words on this occa&s;ion are as plain and pointed as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t this error&mdash;Their mi&s;take at this time gave our Lord a fit occa&s;ion to declare his mind fully and expre&s;sly upon the ca&s;e of infants; that they are of the king|dom of heaven; and therefore none &s;hould forbid, or di&s;cou|rage any from bringing and pre&s;enting them to him. <Q>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e words it appears, in the fir&s;t place, that tho&s;e in|fants which were brought to Chri&s;t, and other infants who like the&s;e, were the children of the covenant, belong to the church of God: for this is what we are here to under&s;tand by the kingdom of heaven, as I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently. Such as the&s;e properly and
<PB N="30" REF="017187_0029_0FA071F10D50A930">naturally &s;ignifies, per&s;ons of this &s;ort or cla&s;s, and that come un|der this denomination&mdash;Such children as the&s;e, and the children that were brought to Chri&s;t were certainly &s;uch: They were in|cluded among that &s;ort of per&s;ons; even as the woman taken in adultery was one of tho&s;e condemned by that law, <Q>which com|manded that &s;uch &s;hould be &s;toned.</Q></P>
<P>Some would fain have the meaning of this expre&s;&s;ion to be, <Q>that tho&s;e who re&s;emble little children in humility belong to the kingdom of heaven.</Q> But how &s;trained and unnatural is this? Chri&s;tians are to re&s;emble lambs and doves for meekne&s;s, as well as infants. But what &s;hould we think of a man that &s;hould &s;ay to his &s;ervant: "Suffer the &s;heep and lambs to come to me, and hinder them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven."&mdash; Would not this be highly improper, and wor&s;e than ridiculous. And yet this would be ju&s;t as proper as the words of Chri&s;t are, according to the meaning that the&s;e would force upon them&mdash; The rea&s;on Chri&s;t gives why the little children &s;hould be brought to him, is, becau&s;e of Such is the kingdom of God.&mdash; And a very plain and pertinent rea&s;on it is, as we under&s;tand it. For if children belong to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, we can &s;ee a manife&s;t fitne&s;s that they &s;hould be pre&s;ented to him as his &s;ub|jects and people, that he might own them, and give them his ble&s;&s;ing. But what weight or pertinency is there in &s;uch a rea|&s;on as our adver&s;aries would a&s;&s;ign for bringing the&s;e children to Chri&s;t? <Q>Suffer little children to come to me, for though it is true they belong not to my kingdom, yet the &s;ubjects of my kingdom are &s;omewhat like them. There is that in little children which looks like meekne&s;s and humility, and is a fit emblem of it.</Q> Mu&s;t every thing then that any ways re|&s;embles true chri&s;tians, be brought to Chri&s;t, for him to lay his hand upon it, and pray over it? What an uncouth, unintelligi|ble rea&s;on is this for bringing children to Chri&s;t? Which will &s;erve as well for a rea&s;on why lambs and doves &s;hould be brought and pre&s;ented to him, as Mr. Henry well ob&s;erves. Becau&s;e the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts of grown per&s;ons, meek and harmle&s;s like children, is it a ju&s;t and plain con&s;equence, that children &s;hould be brought and pre&s;ented to Chri&s;t; though they belong not to his kingdom? Surely no one has any cau&s;e to be angry with another (as Chri&s;t was with his di&s;ciples) for not appre|hending weight in &s;uch a rea&s;on as this. Indeed there is no weight in it.</P>
<P>Again, The reception which Chri&s;t gave the&s;e children, and his actions towards them, may put it out of all doubt that he ac|knowledged them as the &s;ubjects of his kingdom. For he took them in his arms, put his hands upon them, and ble&s;&s;ed them. Chri&s;t never pronounced a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing upon any but tho&s;e whom he owned as the &s;ubjects of his kingdom. By laying his hands on the&s;e children and ble&s;&s;ing them, he recognized them as
<PB N="31" REF="017187_0030_0FA071F1CD7B5310">his own people and put upon them the &s;ame token of acknowledg|ment which he gave his di&s;ciples immediately before his a&s;cen&s;ion. The ble&s;&s;ing was always looked upon as a &s;acred thing, which be|longed only to the profe&s;&s;ed wor&s;hippers and people of God: e&s;pecially that &s;olemn religious ble&s;&s;ing in the name of God, with impo&s;ition of hands, which had been practi&s;ed in the church in all ages. None were the &s;ubjects of this, upon any occa&s;ion that we read of, but they that belonged to the church. When we read that God ble&s;&s;ed Noah, and Abraham, and the other patriarchs, we have no doubt but that hereby he owned them, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, as his people. And &s;hall any be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to deny or call in que&s;tion the church member|&s;hip of infants, after Chri&s;t him&s;elf has not only declared that of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven, but has given this further token and te&s;timony of the &s;ame, even laying on his hands, and pronounc|ing a ble&s;&s;ing upon them: Which is as di&s;tingui&s;hing a token of church member&s;hip as bapti&s;m it&s;elf, or any other ordinance whatever.</P>
<P>The&s;e infants then, and &s;uch as the&s;e mu&s;t be allowed to be|long to the kingdom of heaven. Chri&s;t has declared them &s;o by words and actions as &s;ignificant as po&s;&s;ible. But, it may be en|quired, What are we to under&s;tand by the kingdom of heaven? I an&s;wer, it is plainly the Church that is here meant.&mdash;It will be needle&s;s to confirm this by particular quotations; they are &s;o ma|ny and &s;o well known to all who have read the New Te&s;tament, with any attention. Nor is it denied by any that I know of. But as the kingdom of heaven &s;ometimes &s;ignifies the vi&s;ible church, or kingdom of grace upon earth, and &s;ometimes the kingdom of glory in heaven; it may be enquired, whether it be the church on earth, or in heaven, that is here intended?</P>
<P>Now, I think it will appear, it is the Vi&s;ible Church that is to be under&s;tood, if the following things are well con&s;idered. 1. Our Saviour generally u&s;es the phra&s;e in this &s;en&s;e. There are but few examples, comparatively, can be found, but &s;uch as mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily, or may conveniently be under&s;tood of the kingdom of grace. Thus, the kingdom of heaven, the vi&s;ible church, is like a field &s;own with wheat and tares. It is like a net, which enclo&s;|ed good fi&s;hes and bad. It is like ten virgins, five wi&s;e and five fooli&s;h. It was come to the Jews; and was within them, that is, among them; though it came not with ob&s;ervation. 2. It is the vi&s;ible church alone, and its members, who are the proper &s;ubjects, to whom the outward ordinances, rites, and tokens of church member&s;hip are to be admini&s;tred and applied. There is no go|&s;pel rule or precedent for admitting or acknowledging any as be|longing to the church of God, unle&s;s there be an external and vi|&s;ible ground for it.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e infants which were brought to Chri&s;t, did belong to the invi&s;ible church, and were elected into the kingdom of glory,
<PB N="32" REF="017187_0031_0FA071F28C940820">yet this being a &s;ecret, could be no peculiar rea&s;on why they &s;hould be pre&s;ented to Chri&s;t to receive his ble&s;&s;ing: Nor could it be any rea&s;on why the di&s;ciples &s;hould not forbid their coming, till they knew that they were appointed to be heirs of the king|dom of glory: Nor could this be the rea&s;on why Chri&s;t was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with his di&s;ciples for oppo&s;ing their being brought to him, as he had never told them &s;o, and it was impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould know it otherwi&s;e. But the di&s;ciples did know that in|fants had always been admitted as members of the church. And Chri&s;t had never intimated any de&s;ign of cutting them off. And if they &s;till belonged vi&s;ibly to the kingdom of God, they ought not to be hindred from coming to Chri&s;t, to receive his ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash; He was therefore di&s;plea&s;ed, that they &s;hould treat them as aliens, who did not belong to him, by keeping them back from coming to him. Chri&s;t's ble&s;&s;ing the&s;e children, was an outward token that they were members of his vi&s;ible church. Though Chri&s;t &s;earch|ed and knew the hearts of all the children of men, and who were the heirs of eternal life, yet he outwardly acknowledged and re|ceived as members of his kingdom, only &s;uch as were vi&s;ibly &s;o, according to the &s;ame rule which he has given to tho&s;e who can|not judge of &s;ecret things. He never gave the outward tokens of church member&s;hip, to any as belonging to the kingdom of glory, or the invi&s;ible church; but as belonging to the kingdom of grace. But the outward tokens of church member&s;hip were giv|en to the&s;e infants, becau&s;e they belonged to the kingdom of hea|ven. Which, I think, fairly proves, that it is the vi&s;ible church which is here intended by "the kingdom of heaven." 3. Chri&s;t declares, that the&s;e children, and &s;uch as the&s;e, were then mem|bers of the kingdom of heaven. <Q>Of &s;uch is the kingdom of hea|ven.</Q> But, will any &s;ay, that the kingdom of glory con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who are here upon earth? They were upon earth, and were in the kingdom of heaven upon earth, if they were in it at all; that is, in the kingdom of grace or vi&s;ible church.</P>
<P>But, if it were &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e words are to be under|&s;tood as affirming, that the&s;e children, and &s;uch as the&s;e, belong to the invi&s;ible church, and as &s;uch, are heirs to the kingdom of glory; yet this will prove that they ought to be acknowledged and received as members of the vi&s;ible church. For, can they be rea&s;onably refu&s;ed a place in the church on earth, whom Chri&s;t affirms to be heirs of heaven? If we have evidence that they be|long to Chri&s;t, as his peculiar people, there needs no more to give any one a clear and undoubted right, in the account of the church, to be received as belonging to him, or as members of the church on earth. And what better evidence can there be, that any are &s;ubjects of the kingdom of heaven, than the te&s;timony of the king him&s;elf? Is there any profe&s;&s;ion of faith that ought to have more credit in the church? Though infants are not able to &s;peak for them&s;elves, yet Chri&s;t has &s;poken for them, declaring, that
<PB N="33" REF="017187_0032_0FA071F34CA8E3F8">"of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven." And, is not the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t a &s;ufficient credential to warrant our receiving them? Our Lord &s;ubjoins the following memorable words, in which he &s;trikes at the very root of his di&s;ciples error, which their conduct di&s;covered. <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, &s;hall not enter therein.</Q> The di&s;ciples were much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tand upon their di&s;tinctions. They &s;eemed to think that they had a clearer and better title to the privileges of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom than infants. They were actual believers and followers of Chri&s;t; which could not be &s;aid of babes. If the&s;e are admitted to have a part in this kingdom, it mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a &s;pecial indulgence and favour to them, who have done nothing to give them any claim to &s;uch a privilege. Where|as, thought they, we have left all for the kingdom of heaven's &s;ake. And, &s;hall the&s;e be allowed to have as good a title as we? "Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ays Chri&s;t, their title is as good as yours in all re&s;pects." It is, indeed, an act of mere grace and favour, that infants are admit|ted. They have done nothing to merit it. And, do you imagine, that any thing that you have done gives you any peculiar claim to the&s;e privileges? Do you confider the kingdom of heaven as the due reward for any doings of yours? No, be it known to you, that your title ari&s;es entirely from the free grace and gift of God, as well as theirs. If you will not receive the kingdom of God, and hold it by the &s;ame title that little children do, (viz. as the free gift of God made over to them by his covenant and promi&s;e, as his adopted children) you &s;hall not enter therein
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Receiving the kingdom of God as a little child," is com|monly explained to mean, receiving the privileges of the king|dom of heaven with humility, or a childlike temper. I think, it gives a &s;en&s;e more appo&s;ite to the occa&s;ion, if we under&s;tand the words as importing, that we mu&s;t receive and hold the kingdom of heaven by the &s;ame right and title with children.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The common exception, "That the&s;e infants were not bap|tized by Chri&s;t, nor were brought to him for any &s;uch purpo&s;e," is altogether impertinent. We do not argue, that infants are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, becau&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e infants were baptized by Chri&s;t; but that &s;uch infants belong to the church, is here plainly a&s;&s;erted; and that all &s;uch as belong to the church, are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, cannot be denied. It is fur|ther a&s;ked, "Why Chri&s;t did not then baptize them, if they were proper &s;ubjects?" Before men urge &s;uch que&s;tions, they &s;hould make it appear, that the&s;e infants had not been baptized before. However, whether they were baptized or not, is of no importance to us. If they were not baptized, it is not incum|bent on us to give the rea&s;on. But it is incumbent on tho&s;e who a&s;k &s;uch que&s;tions, to &s;hew. Why &s;hould it be thought nece&s;&s;ary, that all members of the go&s;pel church &s;hould then be baptized,
<PB N="34" REF="017187_0033_0FA071F40BB158E0">before bapti&s;m was fully &s;ettled as the ordinary rite of admi&s;&s;ion, which was not till after Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection. But, if Chri&s;t did not baptize the&s;e children, yet he gave them as &s;ure a token of church member&s;hip as bapti&s;m it&s;elf, when he laid his hands up|on them and ble&s;&s;ed them. It is further objected, "Chri&s;t's en|tire &s;ilence about infant bapti&s;m at this time, has no favourable a&s;pect on &s;uch a practice." An&s;wer. Chri&s;t having a&s;&s;erted the church member&s;hip of infants, and &s;olemnly ble&s;&s;ed them with impo&s;ition of hands, and having &s;aid nothing again&s;t the bapti&s;m of them, more than of adults, the&s;e things have a very favourable a&s;pect on the practice of infant bapti&s;m, and imply a good war|rant for it. After having thus owned them as his people, both by words and actions, if it had been his will that the &s;acrament of induction &s;hould not henceforth be admini&s;tred to infants, as here|tofore, but only to adults, he would not have failed to have given &s;ome intimation on this occa&s;ion, that notwith&s;tanding what he had &s;aid and done, infants were not to be baptized. Chri&s;t's &s;ay|ing nothing again&s;t infant bapti&s;m on this occa&s;ion, when it ap|pears &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to prevent mi&s;takes, had infant bapti&s;m been contrary to his will, has no favourable a&s;pect on the practice of tho&s;e who refu&s;e to admit them.</P>
<P>I have enlarged the more upon this proof of the church mem|ber&s;hip of infants, becau&s;e I take it to be very deci&s;ive and unan|&s;werable. And, I &s;hall lay before you another pa&s;&s;age, which will fairly lead us to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. Mark ix. 36, 37. <Q>Je|&s;us took a child, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them, and when he had taken him in his arms, he &s;aid unto them; who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of &s;uch children in my name, receiveth me.</Q> That this was a young child, appears from Chri&s;t's taking him up in his arms, and al&s;o from his propo&s;ing him to his di&s;ciples as a pattern and emblem of humility and meekne&s;s. But, grown chil|dren, that have attained to what we commonly call the age of di&s;|cretion, to act per&s;onally for them&s;elves in matters of impor|tance, are not wont to be held in the arms; nor are they fit em|blems of humility and meekne&s;s like little children. [And if it &s;hould be &s;aid, "That the&s;e were little children that believed on Chri&s;t." I an&s;wer, The text &s;ays not &s;o. It is true, we after|wards have an awful threatening again&s;t "tho&s;e that &s;hall offend," or lay a &s;tumbling-block, before <Q>one of the&s;e little ones that be|lieve,</Q> as the words are tran&s;lated. But the original may as well be rendered, "one of the&s;e little ones of believers;" or, "one of the little ones, or children, of the&s;e believers." So that we may under&s;tand, not the little ones, but their parents, to be in|tended by tho&s;e who believe in Chri&s;t. And, if we &s;uppo&s;e, that the character of believers is given to the little ones them&s;elves, if will make no difficulty. For, as it cannot be denied, that young children may have the &s;eeds of grace and faith in them, before they are capable and fit to be admitted to make a per&s;onal pro|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="35" REF="017187_0034_0FA071F4CC205AD8">of it to the church; &s;o, being members of the church of &s;ociety of believers, (as has been proved, and &s;hall further be manife&s;ted) they are, in the account and acceptation of the church, believers, according to their capacity, and may be &s;o termed, even as we term them rational creatures, before the pro|per exerci&s;es of the rational faculties plainly appear. Nor can it be &s;aid, that infants cannot be offended, or made to &s;tumble, as the word &s;ignifies.&mdash;They are &s;oon capable of being taught and led on to that which is evil, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is what is here mainly intended. So that I &s;ee not but that tho&s;e little ones, whom Chri&s;t cautions us not to offend, or cau&s;e to &s;tumble, may properly be under&s;tood to be little children; and then we have a further proof that &s;uch belong to the church. But, however this may be, that child which Chri&s;t held up in his arms, as an em|blem and pattern of humility to his di&s;ciples, was doubtle&s;s a lit|tle one.]</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve, Chri&s;t &s;ays, <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of &s;uch children,</Q> (or, "this child," as it is in Luke x. 48.) <Q>in my name, recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth me.</Q> To receive one in the name of Chri&s;t, is to receive him as belonging to him. So the words are clearly explained in the 41&s;t ver&s;e of this chapter. <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall give you to drink a cup of water in my name, becau&s;e ye belong to Chri&s;t, verily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall not lo&s;e his re|ward.</Q> Since then Chri&s;t would have us receive little chil|dren in his name, as belonging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, and declares, that in &s;o doing we receive him; we may a&s;&s;uredly conclude, that they are to be reputed as belonging to him, as the members of his church. When, therefore, a believer offers his child to the church, to be received by bapti&s;m, as belonging to Chri&s;t, and admitted as a member of the &s;ame body; Shall they refu&s;e to receive at in his name? Shall they thus de&s;pi&s;e Chri&s;t's little ones, as to &s;hut the doors of his hou&s;e upon them, and, as much as in them lies, <Q>ca&s;t them out of the inheritance of the Lord, and declare that they have no part in the Lord, and lay &s;uch a &s;tumbling block before our children, to make them cea&s;e from fearing the Lord</Q> Jo&s;h. xxii. 25. God forbid! Take herd that ye de|&s;pi&s;e not, and offend not one of the&s;e little ones. It were better&mdash;</P>
<P>We have a further evidence, that infants are the proper &s;ub|jects of church member&s;hip and bapti&s;m, in that they are ex|pre&s;sly termed di&s;ciples. It will be allowed, that all who are, or appear to be di&s;ciples, are to be admitted as church members, and &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Now the apo&s;tle gives infants the title of di&s;ciples, in Acts xv. 10. <Q>Why tempt ye God to put a yoke on the necks of the di&s;ciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear.</Q> The yoke here mentioned was cir|cumci&s;ion, with the other Jewi&s;h ordinances, which the Judaizing teachers would have impo&s;ed upon the Gentile converts, with their children. The Jews admitted none to circumci&s;ion but
<PB N="36" REF="017187_0035_0FA071F62EB8D4A8">tho&s;e whom they con&s;idered as pro&s;elytes or di&s;ciples of Mo&s;es. The&s;e Judaizing chri&s;tians contended only for the circumci&s;ion of di&s;ciples, or pro&s;elytes to chri&s;tianity. They con&s;idered the children as di&s;ciples. And the apo&s;tle accordingly reproves them for tempting God to lay a yoke upon the neck of the di&s;ciples: So all tho&s;e are termed, for whom this yoke was de&s;igned by the&s;e Jewi&s;h teachers. And as this yoke was de&s;igned to be im|po&s;ed on children, as well as the parents; the apo&s;tle by terming them all di&s;ciples indi&s;criminately and without exception, gives us to under&s;tand that the young children of believers are to be reckoned among the di&s;ciples; even as among the Jews the chil|dren of pro&s;elytes were always accounted pro&s;elytes&mdash;In &s;hort, if the Jewi&s;h teachers were for impo&s;ing upon the Gentile con|verts, and their children, the yoke of circumci&s;ion; and if the impo&s;ing this yoke upon the children was a tempting of God, as well as the laying it upon adults, as all will allow; then it can|not be refu&s;ed, that Peter acknowledges the children to be di&s;|ciples, as well as the parents. For &s;uch are all they without ex|ception for whom this yoke was de&s;igned, which the apo&s;tle re|mon&s;trates again&s;t, as a tempting of God.</P>
<P>But it is objected, that <Q>infants are not di&s;ciples, ina&s;much as they have not been taught; do not deny them&s;elves, take up the cro&s;s, and follow Chri&s;t; continue in his word; bear much fruit, &amp;c. which are laid down in &s;crupture as the characters of true di&s;ciples.</Q> All this is nothing but thin &s;ophi&s;try, and a wretched perver&s;ion of the &s;criptures. It never has, nor will be proved, that no per&s;on can become, nor may be admitted a di&s;|ciple, till he is fir&s;t taught. What is a di&s;ciple, but one who is a pupil or &s;cholar to another, in order that he may be taught? Infants belong to the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, and are as really his di&s;|ciples or &s;cholars, before they learned one le&s;&s;on, as a little child, is a di&s;ciple or &s;cholar of its tutor as &s;oon as ever he is admitted, before he has been taught or learned any thing. A di&s;ciple in the new te&s;tament is equivalent to a pro&s;elyte. And it is well known that among the Jews the infant children were always admitted as pro&s;elytes, together with the parents. When Chri&s;t &s;ays that a man cannot be his di&s;ciple, unle&s;s he will for&s;ake all, take up the cro&s;s, follow him, continue in his word, bear much fruit, love one another, it is plain his words are only to be applied to adults; as appears from the context, as well as the rea&s;on of the thing. Luke xiv. 25. <Q>He turned and &s;aid to the multitudes, If any man cometh to me, (which plainly de&s;igns an adult per|&s;on) and hate not his father, &amp;c. he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</Q> And again ver. 33. <Q>Who&s;oever he be of you (adults) that for|&s;aketh not all, &amp;c. he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</Q> And, can any one per&s;uade him&s;elf, or any other, that Chri&s;t's words are to be ap|plied to infants, when he &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, John xiii. 35. <Q>By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have
<PB N="37" REF="017187_0036_0FA071F64CAD0A78">love one to another.</Q> Chap. xv. 8. <Q>Herein is my Father glo|rified, that ye bear much fruit, &s;o &s;hall ye be my di&s;ciples.</Q>&mdash; And when he told the believing Jews, <Q>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed.</Q> John viii. 31. But if the&s;e things are the indi&s;pen&s;able conditions of di&s;ciple&s;hip to grown per&s;ons; will it follow that infants are not to be admitted as di&s;ciples unle&s;s the&s;e things are found in them? We might as well argue, that infants may not eat, becau&s;e they do not work, &s;ince the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "He that will not work neither may he eat." Nay further, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not nece&s;&s;ary that any one &s;hould fir&s;t practi&s;e all this &s;elf-denial, continue in the word of Chri&s;t, bear much fruit, in order to his being admitted as a di&s;ciple by bapti&s;m. The apo&s;|tles baptized all that made a profe&s;&s;ion of faith immediately. They did not wait to &s;ee whether they continued in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, or bare much fruit, before they put the token of di&s;ci|ples upon them. Yea there were many of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples who did not continue in his word, but went away and left him. Yet till they &s;ell away they were called and accounted di&s;ciples. The meaning of the&s;e words of Chri&s;t is, <Q>That his doctrine is a doc|trine of &s;elf denial; a practical in&s;titution, requiring us to bear much fruit, to continue in his word, to love one another, &amp;c.</Q> If we cannot learn and practi&s;e the&s;e things, it is in vain for us to think of being his di&s;ciples: It will be to no good purpo&s;e to pre|tend to it; nor may we be allowed to continue in his &s;chool or church, but mu&s;t expect to be expelled and ca&s;t out. Now, as there are many adult per&s;ons admitted as di&s;ciples, who do not an&s;wer the character of di&s;ciples indeed, &s;o many who are admit|ted in infancy do afterwards approve them&s;elves good proficients in the&s;e le&s;&s;ons of chri&s;tianity. And we grant that the&s;e things mu&s;t be learned and practi&s;ed by all, according to their capacity and opportunities, in order to their an&s;wering the obligations of true di&s;ciples, whether they were admitted in infancy or after|wards.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider more particularly the words of our text, containing the Apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion. <Q>Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t. Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</Q> It has been ob&s;erved, that the words proper|ly &s;ignify <Q>Go make or admit all nations Di&s;ciples, baptizing them&mdash;teaching them, &amp;c.</Q> This, our oppo&s;ers do not deny. But, they &s;ay, that no one can be made a di&s;ciple but by teaching: which is true, only with re&s;pect to adults: becau&s;e no <Q>&s;uch per&s;ons</Q> are to be admitted into the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, but by their own con&s;ent, and a previous profe&s;&s;ion of their faith in him, and obedience to him, and this nece&s;&s;arily pre-requires teaching. But to argue from hence, that infants are not to be admitted as di&s;ciples, becau&s;e not in a pre&s;ent capacity of being taught, and profe&s;&s;ing their &s;aith, is no better then begging the que&s;tion,
<PB N="38" REF="017187_0037_0FA071F70E0ED0E0">talking at random, not only without proof, but contrary to what has been ju&s;t proved, viz. that <Q>Infants are in fact accounted and teimed Di&s;ciples; belong to Chri&s;t; and to the kingdom of Heaven,</Q> all which are phra&s;es of the &s;ame import.&mdash; Though adults are not made Di&s;cipies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll they are fir&s;t taught, and are not admitted but upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, yet with infants the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e. They are to be admitted upon the profe&s;&s;ion of their parents, by the order of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without a per&s;onal "profe&s;&s;ion and con&s;ent," of which they are not capa|ble. But this may be further con&s;idered afterwards.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee whether any thing can be argued from the words, in favour of infant di&s;ciple&s;hip and bapti&s;m.&mdash;When the Apo&s;tles received an order to di&s;ciple all nations, they would naturally under&s;tand, that they had it in charge to make all na|tions pro&s;elytes, to introduce and admit them into the church of Chri&s;t, as a &s;chool, in which they were to be taught and trained up in the knowledge, and ob&s;ervance of chri&s;tianity, in order to their being meet for heaven. 'Tis true neither infants nor adults are expre&s;sly named. But the Apo&s;tles were &s;ent to di&s;ciple and baptize "the nations," which none can deny, include per&s;ons of every age. And the Apo&s;tles mu&s;t needs have under&s;tood that it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to make Di&s;ciples of the infants, and baptize them as well as others. For, Fir&s;t, It would not otherwi&s;e be po&s;&s;ible that their orders and commi&s;&s;ions could be executed, or &s;o much as one nation be pro&s;elyted to Chri&s;t to the end of the world, unle&s;s all the young children were removed out of it. Children, in minority, make up a great part of every nation.&mdash;If the&s;e can|not be made di&s;ciples, it will forever be an impo&s;&s;ibility that any nation &s;hould become di&s;ciples, unle&s;s we can find a nation with|out children. And as all who are not the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t be|long vi&s;ibly to the kingdom of Satan, the adver&s;ary will hold a large part of the world vi&s;ibly under his dominion; from which he cannot be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected.&mdash;And it would be impo&s;&s;ible that that word &s;hould be fulfilled, <Q>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdom of the Lord and his Chri&s;t.</Q> Secondly, Let it be remembered that the Apo&s;tles had been educated in the Jewi&s;h church, of which infants had all along been undoubted members. They under&s;tood that the member&s;hip of &s;uch had never been called in que&s;tion, &s;ince there had been a church in the world. They knew that the infants of pro&s;elytes from among the Gentiles were con&s;tantly admitted and circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed, together with their parents. Not only &s;o, but &s;uch infants were baptized; as the ancient Jews report. They knew that Chri&s;t had taught them that little children belonged to the kingdom of Heaven; that he had accordingly laid his hands, and pronounced a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing upon them; and &s;ignified his will that they be re|ceived in his name, as belonging to him; and that them&s;elves had been reproved by him for forbidding infants to be brought to
<PB N="39" REF="017187_0038_0FA071F7CC981F00">receive his ble&s;&s;ing. They knew, that the admi&s;&s;ion of the children into the church, with the parents, was always reckoned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great privilege; that Chri&s;t never &s;aid or intimated that it was his will that infants &s;hould be cut off, or not admitted &s;till as mem|bers of the go&s;pel church. They under&s;tood that the privileges of the church were to be enlarged, and not abridged in any re|&s;pect.&mdash;Now, the Apo&s;tles, who&s;e views and apprehen&s;ions may have been &s;uch as has been repre&s;ented, would, without doubt, have under&s;tood that they were in&s;tructed by their commi&s;&s;ion to admit the children with the parents, into the number of pro&s;e|lytes by the initiating rate, as had been the con&s;tant practice of the church.&mdash;They mu&s;t have under&s;tood the matter as a mini&s;|ter, who had never heard that infant bapti&s;m was ever objected to, would under&s;tand his charge, if he was ordained and &s;ent out to preach to the heathen, and gather churches among them, baptizing them. It would be unnatural, and highly unrea&s;ona|ble for them to under&s;tand the matter otherwi&s;e. This then mu&s;t be received as the ju&s;t interpretation of the commi&s;&s;ion. It is the natural and true meaning: Which is &s;o far from cutting off infants from the go&s;pel church, that it furni&s;hes us with a good warrant for admitting them.</P>
<P>We have another unan&s;werable proof, that the children of believers are members of the vi&s;ible church, and &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m, in 1 Cor. vii. 14. <Q>The unbelieving hu&s;band is &s;anctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is &s;anctified by the hu&s;band: El&s;e were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</Q> The Apo&s;tle had ju&s;t &s;aid, that a believer ought not to &s;eparate from an unbelieving con&s;ort, who was willing to continue in the mar|riage relation. And in the&s;e words he removes a doubt which might be apt to ari&s;e in their minds, viz. Whether the children born in &s;uch a marriage were to be reckoned as belonging to the church, with the believing parents; or were to be ranked with the unbelieving parent, and &s;o reckoned among heathens that were without?&mdash;Though infants had always been received as members of the Old Te&s;tament church, yet when the Jews had, in the time of Ezra married &s;trange wives, which had born them children, the&s;e children were not received; but it was ordered that they be put away, together with their heathen parents, as unclean. It might therefore be a &s;cruple, whether a believer, and member of the Chri&s;tian church, were obliged or allowed to live in the &s;tate of marriage with an unbeliever; and whether their children were not to be excluded from the church, as the un|clean offspring of a heathen parent; as had been determined a|mong the Jews in the ca&s;e ju&s;t mentioned. This point, the apo&s;|tle plainly re&s;olves, declaring, that a believer is not defiled by having conjugal &s;ociety with an unbeliever. On the contrary, &s;ays he, "The unbelieving hu&s;band is &s;anctified by the wi&s;e," or rather is &s;anctified in or to the wi&s;e, "and the unbelieving wi&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="017187_0039_0FA071F88E2696D0">is &s;anctified in or to the hu&s;band." That is, the believer, has a lawful and &s;anctified enjoyment of an unbelieving yoke-fellow. For, as the apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere teaches us, <Q>All things are pure to him that is pure. And every creature of God is good, and nothing to be le&s;u&s;ed. For, it is &s;anctified by the word of God and prayer.</Q> Thus the unbelieving hu&s;band or wife is &s;ancti|fied to the believer, as every creature of God is, which we may have occa&s;ion to u&s;e. Formerly, all that were out of the pale of the church were accounted unclean; and a Jew would have been defiled by living with a heathen con&s;ort. But now there is no defilement in the lawful u&s;e of any of God's creatures. They are all &s;anctified to a believer. Or we may take the meaning of the&s;e words thus: A believer and unbeliever being married together, are one fle&s;h: They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> principal or &s;ource of offspring. But though an unbeliever, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered in him&s;elf per&s;onally, is unholy, and has no claim to church privileges; yet the children are inti|tled to the&s;e privileges, as fully and perfectly in all re&s;pects, as if both the parents were believers. For the unbelieving hu&s;band being one fle&s;h with the believin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;e, is &s;anctified in or by her, &s;o far as re&s;pects the propagation of children. The hu&s;band, though an unbeliever, is, in con&s;equence of his union in marriage with a believer, in &s;ome &s;ort &s;anctified. The one fle&s;h con&s;tituted by the marriage union is, as I may &s;ay, entirely &s;anctified; and not a coale&s;cence or conjunction of unholy and holy. The un|believer, in this relation is capable of propagating a holy &s;eed, and tran&s;miting church privileges to his offspring, to as good ad|vantage as any believer.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle goes on&mdash;"El&s;e were your children unclean," as the heathen were termed and accounted. All tho&s;e who were aliens from the common-wealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers to the covenant of the promi&s;e, and not members of the church of God, were commonly reputed uncircumci&s;ed and unclean. They were not admitted into the holy place, or to attend on holy or|dinances. Now, if the unbelieving con&s;ort were not &s;anctified to and by the believer, as has been &s;aid, the children mu&s;t have been un|clean, and &s;o not be received as members of the church, and &s;ub|jects of holy ordinances.&mdash;"But now they are holy."&mdash;They have the denomination of &s;aints, or holy ones: And are to be admit|ted into the vi&s;ible church, into the &s;ociety and fellow&s;hip of tho&s;e who are vi&s;ibly &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, and devoted to God as his holy people. The word, Holy, as it is u&s;ed in &s;crip|ture, is applied to per&s;ons and things that are devoted and dedi|cated to God. Men are termed holy either as being &s;eparated from the re&s;t of mankind, and &s;tanding in a peculiar relation to God, as his vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ing people; or as being conformed to the will and moral image of God in temper and practice. The one is called a relative, the other an inherent holine&s;s. The fir&s;t is attributed to all tho&s;e who belong to the vi&s;ible church. Thus
<PB N="41" REF="017187_0040_0FA071F94D980AA0">the people of I&s;rael are all &s;poken of as an holy people. And, upon the &s;ame account, go&s;pel churches are con&s;idered as con|fi&s;ting of &s;aints or holy per&s;ons. For, though it is not &s;uppo&s;ed that they are all really and inherently holy, or partakers of a divine nature, yet they are vi&s;ibly the people of God, &s;eparated and devoted to him. But let it be particularly noted, that no per&s;on is ever &s;tiled holy from the beginning to the end of the bible, except he be of the church of God. And in the new te&s;ta|ment, a Saint or Holy Per&s;on, a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, a Member of the Church, and a &s;ubject of the Kingdom of Heaven are of the &s;ame &s;ignification. Now, &s;ince we find that the title or appellati|on of Holy is never given to any per&s;on in the world, except he be of the church; and &s;ince the apo&s;tle declares, that the children of believers are holy; it is a plain and undeniable con&s;equence, that &s;uch children are of the church, and &s;o are the proper &s;ub|jects of bapti&s;m, as was to be proved.</P>
<P>The Antipedobapti&s;ts have endeavoured, in vain, to wring and wre&s;t the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle to a compliance with their te|nets.&mdash;But, in the fir&s;t place they would per&s;uade us, <Q>That the Holine&s;s which the apo&s;tle here intends, cannot be that which is implied in, and connected with church member&s;hip.&mdash;For, they &s;ay, the &s;ame Holine&s;s which is a&s;cribed to the children, is al&s;o attributed to the unbelieving parent&mdash;If the children are Holy, the unbelieving hu&s;band and wife are al&s;o &s;aid to be Sanctified.</Q> But, I an&s;wer, the apo&s;tle's words plainly &s;hew, that the unbelieving yoke-fellow is only &s;anctified to the be|liever, as all the creatures of God are &s;aid to be &s;anctified to the Saints, &s;o as that they may have a holy u&s;e and enjoyment of them. Or, He is only &s;o &s;anctified by becoming one fle&s;h with a believer, that he is capable of propagating a holy &s;eed. He is not &s;anctified in re&s;pect to God, but only in re&s;pect to his con&s;ort and offspring, who derive no more defilement either by conjugal co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">habitation with or by natural generation from him, than if he were a believer.&mdash;In a word, the unbelieving hu&s;band is only Sanctified in that particular re&s;pect, and unto the particular pur|po&s;e there pointed at, as has been &s;aid.&mdash;But the Children are declared to be not unclean, but "holy, or &s;aints." A title which is never given to any but tho&s;e that are of the church. Unbe|lievers who belong not to the church may be &s;anctified, or pre|pared as in&s;truments to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of divine goodne&s;s to the &s;aints. But this re&s;pective &s;anctification does never give them the denomination of "Holy ones, or Saints." The words of the text, and the rea&s;on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing therefore plainly &s;how, that the Sanctification of the unbelieving hu&s;band or wife is a dif|ferent thing from the holine&s;s of the children.&mdash;This gives a good, pertinent and in&s;tructive &s;en&s;e to the apo&s;tle's words, which are taken and explained in the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, as no doubt they ought to be. And if the holine&s;s of the children is &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="42" REF="017187_0041_0FA071FA0D4041F8">&s;ignify &s;omething different from the &s;anctification of the unbe|lieving parent, it need not &s;tumble us, &s;uch variations are ob&s;ervable in other places, where the &s;ame word bears a &s;omewhat different meaning in different parts of the &s;ame &s;entence. See John xvii. 19. <Q>For their &s;akes I Sanctify my&s;elf, that they al&s;o might be Sanc|tified through the truth.</Q> Tit. i. 15. <Q>Unto the pure all things are pure.</Q> Be&s;ure, according to our adver&s;aries interpreta|tion, the words, Sanctified and Holy, bear a very different mean|ing; the one Signfying, "married," the other, "Legitimate."</P>
<P>And hence we &s;ee, there is no ju&s;t foundation for that objec|tion, <Q>That the unbelieving parent being &s;anctified by a believ|ing yoke-fellow, may as well be concluded to be a member of the church and &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, as the children who&s;e holi|ne&s;s depends upon this &s;anctification of the parents.</Q> For a per&s;on's being &s;anctified in &s;ome certain re&s;pect, does not give him the denomination of a Saint, or holy one, in the language of the &s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ptures; which is a peculiar and appropriate title of tho&s;e who belong to the church, and is never given to any others of the children of men. And, &s;ince the children are Holy, or Saints, which is not &s;aid of the unbelieving parent, though in &s;ome re|&s;pect &s;anctified; the children are to be acknowledged as of the church, but not the unbelieving parent.</P>
<P>Nor is there any more rea&s;on in what is further urged, <Q>That we may as well argue from the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, that children of a believer, though forty or fifty years old, are to be accounted holy and received into the church, without a per|&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith, as that infants are to be &s;o accounted and received; &s;ince they are all alike children, and intitled to the rights and privileges of children.</Q> For, though it is true, that the word Children does not determine their age, yet what the apo&s;tle &s;ays of them, &s;hews, that he means only children in minority, as plainly as when he gives it in charge to fathers to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. For they are therefore accounted and &s;tiled holy and not unclean, becau&s;e one of the parents at lea&s;t is a believer. But this rea&s;on holds only with re&s;pect to &s;uch as are in their minority. Such children as are of age cannot be concluded to be unclean or out of the church, though both the parents are unbelievers, and un&s;anctified. For, adult children may act for them&s;elves and be admitted into the church upon a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith. And on the other hand, it cannot be concluded with any certainty, that adult children are holy, though the parents are believers. For the children may live in open infidelity. The connection between the faith and &s;anctification of the parents, and the holine&s;s of the children, which the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts, holds only with re&s;pect to infants or minors; which is a clear proof that the&s;e only, and not adults are, the children here &s;poken of.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="017187_0042_0FA071FACC955040">
Let us now con&s;ider how this pa&s;&s;age is expounded by tho&s;e on the other fide. And here they would per&s;uade us, <Q>that the apo&s;tle means, what they call, a matrimonial holine&s;s.</Q> And that the meaning of the text is, "The unbelieving hu&s;band is married or e&s;pou&s;ed to the wife, and the unbelieving wife, married to the hu&s;band: el&s;e were your children ba&s;tards, but now are they legitimate." I do not think it will be needful to &s;ay much to expo&s;e the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this interpretation. It is &s;o &s;trained and unnatural, it &s;o &s;inks and &s;poils the &s;en&s;e, and is &s;o utterly without foundation, that I think it may pa&s;s for one of the mo&s;t improbable, unhand&s;ome, and incredible glo&s;&s;es, that we &s;hall readily meet with upon any text whatever. The no|tion of per&s;ons being &s;anctified, in any &s;en&s;e, by marriage has no &s;ort of foundation in the &s;criptures; which never once u&s;e the words Sanctified, or Holy, to &s;ignify tho&s;e who are married. And, if the Jewi&s;h Rabbies have &s;ometimes u&s;ed the Hebrew word which u&s;ually &s;ignifies a Sanctifying to expre&s;s marriage; this is a modern, and not a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, and is not to be regarded, But whatever the Hebrew word may import in the Rabbinical writings, it is only the Greek words, Hagiazo and Hagios, that we are concerned with. And it has not yet been found, that the&s;e have ever been u&s;ed to denote either a marrying, or being legitimate. In &s;hort, our opponents have had the boldne&s;s to fix a meaning to the apo&s;tle's words wholly different from the &s;en&s;e which the words bear in any part of the &s;cripture: A mean|ing un&s;upported by any good authority, or parallel example in any Greek writer, &s;acred or profane. And e&s;pecially, that the word Hagios, Holy, which is predicated of the children; &s;hould &s;ignify legitimate is, for what yet appears, quite without example. Let the pretence then of Matrimonial Sanctification and Holy Le|gitimacy, go for an idle figment, and be exploded with ju&s;t indig|nation and contempt
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only places of &s;cripture I have ever &s;een brought to &s;upport this &s;trange &s;en&s;e, which is invented and put on the word, Holy, are Ezra ix. 2. Mal. ii. 15. Where mention is made of The Holy Seed, and, A Godly Seed. But we have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to imagine that their legitimacy is what is intended by the&s;e epithets. They are plainly termed a Holy Seed, and a &s;eed of God, not becau&s;e they were legitimate, but becau&s;e they were of the church, the vi&s;ible people of God.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, according to this interpretati|on of the text, the &s;en&s;e will be very poor, trifling and unin&s;tructive: and the apo&s;tle's rea&s;on again&s;t a believers &s;eparating from an un|believing con&s;ort will turn out weak and impertinent. Neither the Corinthians, nor any one el&s;e doubted, or had need to be told, that the unbelieving hu&s;band had been and was married to the wife, and the unbelieving wife to the hu&s;band. For, how could they be hu&s;band and wife, if they had not been married to|gether?
<PB N="44" REF="017187_0043_0FA071FB8C8DF188">And, can any one believe in &s;ober earne&s;t, that the in|&s;pired apo&s;tle filled up his epi&s;tle with &s;uch a trifling ridiculous bu&s;ine&s;s, as telling his converts, that if they had children without being married, the children would be ba&s;tards, but now as they had been married, they were legitimate! Far be it from any chri&s;tian to burle&s;que the &s;acred &s;criptures, at this rate&mdash;It is mere trave&s;ty&mdash;A profane infidel, who would ridicule the apo&s;tle could &s;carce give his words a meaner, and more ludicrous turn.</P>
<P>But, it may be &s;aid, "That the Corinthians doubted whether a believer were not loo&s;ed from the bond of marriage to an unbe|liever, and con&s;equently at liberty to &s;eparate." I an&s;wer, if this were the doubt, the apo&s;tle's &s;aying, <Q>That the unbeliever is married to the believer,</Q> was not to the purpo&s;e of deter|mining, that a believer ought to cohabit with an unbeliever. This would be only &s;aying, that the marriage contract is bind|ing upon the unbelieving party; and con&s;equently, that an un|believer ought not to &s;eparate from a believer. But this will not prove but that the believer may be at liberty, notwith&s;tanding, and that it may be expedient for him to forbear cohabitation with an infidel. Nor can it be &s;aid, that if one party be bound, the o|ther cannot be at liberty. For, it is well known, that in &s;ome ca&s;es, the one party may be at liberty to repudiate the other, and yet that other party may not be at liberty till after an actual di|vorce. So that the apo&s;tle's rea&s;on again&s;t a &s;eparation of the marriage union between a believer and an unbeliever, according to the Antipedobapti&s;ts, will only prove that an unbeliever ought not to repudiate a believer; which every one &s;ees, was not the point he was con&s;idering; which was, whether a believer ought to part from an unbeliever. And according to the mean|ing they put upon the apo&s;tle's words, his rea&s;on ought to have &s;tood thus, in order to its having any pertinency in it: <Q>The be|lieving hu&s;band is bound in marriage to the unbelieving wife, and the believing wife to the unbelieving hu&s;band.</Q> Whoever was the author of this uncouth invention, it is certainly a great injury to the apo&s;tle, to imagine, that &s;o poor a &s;entiment, and &s;uch left handed rea&s;oning, could fall from his divine pen.</P>

After the fall of man, by the breach of the fir&s;t covenant, God was plea&s;ed to reveal a new and gracious covenant, of which Chri&s;t was the Mediator; which was to be the rule of intercour&s;e and communion between God and his people, and the great charter by which the church was formed. All who were taken into this covenant were thereby &s;eparated from the re&s;t of man|kind, and brought into a peculiar relation to God, as his people and &s;ubjects, to be ruled by the &s;pecial laws, and ob&s;erve the &s;pe|cial ordinances, and enjoy the &s;pecial privileges of his kingdom. This kingdom of grace was to make an outward appearance up|on earth, and have an outward admini&s;tration in the vi&s;ible church, according to the rules which God ordained. And ac|cording to the&s;e rules, all who were vi&s;ibly in the covenant, were to be admitted as members of the vi&s;ible church. They were to have the appointed token of the covenant put upon them, and were vi&s;ible &s;ubjects of the outward ordinances and privileges of the church. For, a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the covenant, a right of mem|ber&s;hip in the vi&s;ible church, a right to the token of the covenant and of church member&s;hip, and to the outward ordinances and privileges, which, according to the covenant, belong to the church; the&s;e things are in&s;eparably connected together, and mu|tually infer each other. Many, it is true, who are in the cove|nant vi&s;ibly, and in the acceptation of the church, have not a real and &s;aving intere&s;t in new covenant ble&s;&s;ings. They will not at la&s;t be owned by God as his peculiar people; nor is there a &s;pi|ritual, effectual, and &s;aving application of the grace of the new covenant to them. Hence ari&s;es the common di&s;tinction between the vi&s;ible, and the invi&s;ible church. But the outward ordinan|ces of the church are to be admini&s;tred to all, and only tho&s;e, who are vi&s;ibly in the covenant, and of the church.</P>
<P>Now, if this covenant, by which the church is formed and con&s;tituted, includes the children with the parents, then the&s;e children belong to the church; and the token of the covenant, and of admi&s;&s;ion into the church, belongs regularly and vi&s;ibly to them. This then is the point we have to prove.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered, in the fir&s;t place, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of infants being comprehended in the covenant, and being the &s;ub|jects of its outward admini&s;tration in the vi&s;ible church, is no ways incredible, on account of any incapacity in them. For, they are certainly capable of coming under its bonds, and having the grace of it &s;ecured and applied to them; and they greatly need new covenant ble&s;&s;ings. It is an important privilege to them to belong to the vi&s;ible church, that they may, under its watch, in|&s;tructions and di&s;cipline, be trained up in the nurture and admo|nition of the Lord. They are al&s;o capable of having the outward token of the covenant put upon them; which may afterwards be improved by them for their excitement and encouragement in
<PB N="46" REF="017187_0045_0FA071FD0D249408">the &s;ervice of God. In &s;hort, infants are, for ought that appears, as capable &s;ubjects as any of the obligations, the privileges, and token of the covenant; and they &s;tand in like need thereof with others. The pre&s;umption, therefore, is not at all again&s;t, but ra|ther in favour of their being comprehended in the covenant, and in the church of God, as well as others.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve, that it has always been cu&s;tomary for children to be included in covenants with the parents; to come under the bonds, and receive the privileges therein &s;tipulated. That this is common in covenants which take place among man|kind is known to all; and no one imagines there is any thing un|rea&s;onable and improper in it, if the covenant be in it&s;elf good and rea&s;onable. It is al&s;o certain, that when God has been plea&s;ed to covenant with mankind, the children as well as the parents have been comprehended. This appears to have been the ca&s;e in the covenant with Adam, with Noah, with Abraham, and with the I&s;raelites at Horeb. Indeed, this &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e in all God's federal tran&s;actions with the children of men. It is, therefore, altogether agreeable to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, and the method of God's government of his people, that his covenant with them &s;hould re&s;pect and take in both them and their &s;eed. And this con&s;ideration may, I think, render it quite credible, and &s;omewhat probable, that the new covenant, by which the church is con&s;tituted, may be, in this re|&s;pect, &s;imilar to God's covenant tran&s;actions with mankind, which, &s;o far as appears, have con&s;tantly comprehended the children with the parents.</P>
<P>But, having premi&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall proceed to the direct and po&s;itive proof, that the children of God's covenant people, have al&s;o an intere&s;t in the covenant. The new covenant, which, I have &s;aid, is the great charter by which the church is formed, does mo&s;t plainly and expre&s;sly take them in. It was, in|deed, this new covenant I am &s;peaking of, that was revealed to our fir&s;t parents the very day that they fell, and by the propo&s;al of it to them, they were con&s;tituted the vi&s;ible church and people of God, before they were expelled from paradi&s;e.&mdash;It was again revealed to Noah after the flood, whereby he, with his children, were again recognized by God as his church and people. The &s;ame covenant was afterwards more clearly and di&s;tinctly reveal|ed to Abraham, and the ordinance of circumci&s;ion was annexed, as an outward &s;ign and token. And though there are &s;ufficient intimations, that the &s;eed of God's vi&s;ible and profe&s;&s;ed people, had always, from the beginning, been con&s;idered as in the cove|nant, and church of God; yet as this is mo&s;t expre&s;sly declared in the revelation which God made of his gracious covenant to A|braham, I &s;hall take this more e&s;pecially as the ground of the pre|&s;ent argument.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="017187_0046_0FA071FDCB9197F8">
The Abrahamic covenant, I &s;ay, was but a plainer exhibition of that &s;ame new and gracious covenant, which had been all along the foundation and charter of the church. The addition of a new ord nance, and the grant of a particular country to him and his natural po&s;terity, made no alteration in its &s;ub&s;tantial duties, or privileges, but only pointed out a different external admini&s;tra|tion, which was to take place in the church. Hitherto the ex|ternal admin &s;tration of the church &s;eems to have been dome&s;tic; the ordinances of wor&s;hip being di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately admini&s;|tred in the &s;everal families of the Patriarchs: nor do we read of &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, for the purpo&s;e of attending public wor&s;hip. But, as God had a de&s;ign of forming a national church, of the po|&s;terity of Abraham, all the members of which were to join and have an external communion with each other in the &s;ame ordi|nances, and acts of wor&s;hip; this different mode of admini&s;tration was provided for in the grant of the land of Canaan to the po&s;|terity of Abraham; that &s;o they might be formed into a political body, and live together, for their convenient attendance on holy ordinances. But this provi&s;ion, which was made for a different external admini&s;tration in the church, is no argument but that the covenant which was revealed to Abraham was, for &s;ub&s;tance, the very &s;ame with that by which the church had at fir&s;t been formed, and had all along &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>This may &s;hew how unrea&s;onably &s;ome would in&s;inuate, that we would make &s;everal covenants of grace. As if the &s;ame co|venant could not be revealed "at &s;undry times and in divers manners," and as if there might not be a different external ad|min &s;tration of ordinances in the church at different times, and yet the covenant by which the church is con&s;tituted remain &s;ub|&s;tantially the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now, that we may di&s;tinctly &s;tate this argument, grounded on the covenant with Abraham, let us take a view of it as we have it recorded in Gen. xvii. <Q>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant be|tween me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. As for me, my covenant is with thee, and thou &s;halt be a father of many nations. Neither &s;hall thy name any more be Abram, but thy name &s;hall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and Kings &s;hall come out of thee&mdash;And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee. And thy &s;eed after thee in their generations, for an everla&s;ting covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee. And I will give unto thee and to thy &s;eed after thee, the land in which thou art a &s;tranger; all the land of Canaan for an everla&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and I will be their God. Thou &s;halt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy &s;eed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant which ye &s;hall keep
<PB N="48" REF="017187_0047_0FA071FF416B9A08">between me and you, and thy &s;eed after thee: Every man Child among you &s;hall be circumci&s;ed. And ye &s;hall circum|ci&s;e the fle&s;h of your fore&s;kin, and it &s;hall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old &s;hall be circumci&s;ed among you, every man child in your ge|neration; he that is born in the hou&s;e, or bought with money of any &s;tranger which is not of thy &s;eed. He that is born in thy hou&s;e, and he that is bought with thy money, mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed; and my covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an everla&s;ting covenant. And the uncircumci&s;ed man child who&s;e fle&s;h of his fore&s;kin is not circumci&s;ed, that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</Q></P>
<P>From this memorable pa&s;&s;age, which I have recited at large, we &s;ee that the Abrahamic covenant comprehended the children with the parents, in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations; and that the outward token of an intere&s;t in the covenant was to be applied to infants. We may further ob&s;erve, that all who were includ|ed in this covenant were by it con&s;tituted a vi&s;ible church, &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t of the world to be the people of God. That grand article of the covenant, <Q>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</Q> implies, that they were to &s;tand in a peculiar relation to God, as his church; who were to be &s;ubject to peculiar laws and ordinances, by ob&s;erving which, they declared on their part, That they were his People. This promi&s;e contains al&s;o the &s;um of new covenant ble&s;&s;ings. The promi&s;es and ordinances did ap|pertain only to the church; of which all who had an intere&s;t in the covenant were members. Infants, therefore, being expre&s;sly included in the covenant, were always looked upon as of the vi|&s;ible church and people of God; and were to receive the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing token of a covenant dedication to him.</P>
<P>Nor was this covenant, with its ordinances and privilege ever limited to Abraham, and his natural po&s;terity; and particular|ly that article which takes the infant &s;eed into the church with the parents, was not any peculiar privilege of the native Hebrews: nor was circumci&s;ion appointed as the token of a peculiar inte|re&s;t in tho&s;e temporal ble&s;&s;ings, which were granted exclu&s;ively to the natural &s;eed of Abraham, as &s;ome would pretend. For it appears that by the expre&s;s direction of God &s;ome were to have the token of the covenant and of church member&s;hip for them&s;elves and their children, who were neither the natural de|&s;cendants of Abraham, nor were with them to inherit the land of Canaan. When circumci&s;ion was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, not only Abraham, with his &s;on I&s;hmael, but all the males of his family were ordered to have this token of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church. And it was a &s;tanding rule, that bought &s;ervants, and children born in the hou&s;e, &s;hould be circumci&s;ed. And the old Te&s;tament church did receive pro&s;elytes from the Gentiles; and this token of their intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham was
<PB N="49" REF="017187_0048_0FA071FF4CF3B838">accordingly admini&s;tred to them and their children; who were thereupon &s;ubjects of Church ordinances, and privileges. But this their intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham gave them no right of inheritance with the native I&s;raelites in the land of Canaan. Which I think is a clear proof, that the covenant with Abraham, to which circumci&s;ion was annexed, was not any mere national covenant, conveying peculiar temporal privileges to him and his po&s;terity, but it could be no other than God's new and gra|cious covenant; by the revelation of which, tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed|ly con&s;ented to it, with their children, were con&s;tituted his vi&s;ible church and people, and were the regular &s;ubjects of the ordi|nances appertaining to its outward admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Abrahamic covenant, we &s;ee, did comprehend both pa|rents and their infant children, con&s;tituting them members of the vi&s;ible church. And not only the natural children of Abra|ham, but all that were afar off among the Gentiles, even as many the Lord &s;hould call, upon their becoming pro&s;elytes, profe&s;&s;ing the faith and religion of the church, they and their infant chil|dren had an intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham, and were to be received into the vi&s;ible church by the initiating rite. They were adopted into the family of Abraham, and, <Q>the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham came upon the Gentiles,</Q> and he was <Q>made the father of many nations,</Q> long before the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation took place, and before the di&s;&s;olution of the national hierarchy of the Jews, which was a middle wall of partition between them and the Gentiles. Even before this wall was taken away, there was a door left open in it, to receive all of every nation, who would join them&s;elves to the God of Abraham, and take hold of his cove|nant.</P>
<P>The church having been con&s;tituted, according to the cove|nant, with Abraham, it mu&s;t be allowed, that during its continu|ance, the children are as evidently in covenant, and of the church, and &s;ubjects of the initiating ordinance, as any others. If then it &s;hall appear, that this covenant &s;tands now in force, and that the go&s;pel church is in and under it, and enjoys all its privileges with|out any abridgment; the church member&s;hip of infants, and their right to the token of admi&s;&s;ion, will &s;tand upon the &s;ame firm ba|&s;is, that it did under the Old Te&s;tament. But, if it &s;hall appear, that the covenant with Abraham, is di&s;annulled, and that the church is now con&s;tituted upon a plan entirely new; then the intere&s;t of infants in the go&s;pel covenant, and their right of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church, can no otherwi&s;e be argued from the Abra|hamic covenant, than by analogy, parity of rea&s;on, and &s;uch like con&s;iderations; which, however probable, are &s;carce conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The adver&s;aries of infant church member&s;hip, would per&s;uade us, that this covenant, which included the infant children, was not God's new and gracious covenant with his church, but a &s;pecial compact, containing a grant of mere outward and temporal pri|vileges,
<PB N="50" REF="017187_0049_0FA072000C125CD0">long &s;ince aboli&s;hed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Gill &s;ays, <Q>That the covenant made with Abraham was of a mixed kind; that it had promi&s;es and mercies of a temporal nature, which belonged to his natural feed, and others of a &s;piritual &s;ort, which belonged to his &s;piritual &s;eed&mdash;The latter are comprized chiefly in God being a God to him and them.</Q> An&s;wer to Dickin&s;on. p. 48. But he denies, that this covenant, "&s;o far as it was a covenant of grace," was made with his natu|ral &s;eed, as &s;uch, or with the natural &s;eed of believing Gentiles.</P>
<P>Now, if it appear that this article of the covenant, which com|prizes &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, belongs to the natural po&s;terity of Abra|ham, including their infants, it is then undeniable, even upon the Doctor's own conce&s;&s;ion, that they have an intere&s;t in the cove|nant of Abraham, "as it is a covenant of grace." But this ap|pears from Deut. xxix. 10, &mdash;13. <Q>Ye &s;tand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of I&s;rael, your little ones, your wives, and thy &s;tranger that is in thy camp, that thou &s;houlde&s;t enter into covenant with the Lord thy God. That he may e&s;tabli&s;h thee this day to be a people to him&s;elf, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath &s;aid unto thee, and as he hath &s;worn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to I&s;aac, and to Jacob.</Q> We &s;ee here, that the &s;ame covenant which God had &s;worn to Abraham, and particularly that promi&s;e, <Q>I will be a God to thee,</Q> which comprizes &s;piritual mercies, as Dr. Gill ju&s;tly owns, and is, according to him, a covenant of grace. This covenant, and this promi&s;e, is renewed to them, and <Q>their little ones in particular,</Q> are declared to be comprehended in it. The &s;ame promi&s;e is often repeated, and in the &s;ame extent. Jer. xxxi. 1. "At that time," which refers to the go&s;pel times, when they &s;hould &s;erve the Lord their God, and David their king, chap. xxx. 9. <Q>&s;aith the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of I&s;rael, and they &s;hall be my people.</Q> The families, therefore, which include the infant children, were to have an intere&s;t in the covenant of grace. The new covenant was promi&s;ed to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael and Judah, which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s comprehend the chil|dren of their families. And, the &s;ame promi&s;e is made to them, "I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people," ver. 31. And, tho&s;e promi&s;es which peculiarly appertain to the covenant of grace, and contain a grant of &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, are, in &s;cripture, often made to the &s;eed or natural po&s;terity of God's people. See Deut. xxv. 6. I&s;ai. xliv. 3, 4. Chap. lix. 21. And the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace, made with Abraham, are come upon the Gentiles, or nations to whom Abraham is become a father, according to the divine promi&s;e, <Q>That they might ob|tain the promi&s;e of the Spirit through faith.</Q> They are, there|fore, the privilege of us and our children, as &s;hall afterwards be &s;hewn. And, whereas it is objected, that all who have an intere&s;t in the covenant of grace, mu&s;t needs be heirs of &s;alvation, which we cannot think is the ca&s;e of all the natural offspring of church members: I &s;hall only &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, though profe&s;&s;ed believers and their children are alike intere&s;ted in the covenant, and vi&s;ibly heirs of &s;alvation, and as &s;uch, the &s;ubjects of church ordinances; yet, this does no more in&s;ure final &s;alvation to all the children, than it does to all adult profe&s;&s;ors. But this will be further con|&s;idered in the &s;equel. And, if the covenant of grace, in re&s;pect of its external admini&s;tration, comprehends &s;ome who are not par|takers of its &s;piritual and &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings, we have no more rea&s;on to think this &s;ubject incredible, than that the vi&s;ible church, which is the &s;ubject of ordinances, &s;hould contain hypocrites. The rule God has given to direct us in our admini&s;trations, was never de|&s;igned to make a perfect &s;eparation of the elect from the re&s;t of mankind, in this world. This is none of our concerns. <Q>The Lord knoweth them that are his.</Q></P></NOTE> That &s;tupid and ridiculous pre|tence, that this was a covenant of works, I pa&s;s over as unwor|thy of notice. Such wild, unfavoury notions mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t all &s;o|ber Chri&s;tians. It is al&s;o &s;aid, "That the covenant with Abra|ham cannot be the covenant of grace, becau&s;e it might be kept and broken by men; and included tho&s;e who were not &s;aved; was not from everla&s;ting, but had its beginning in time; and men were in time taken into it, and put out of it, &amp;c." I need not &s;tay to canva&s;s the&s;e things di&s;tinctly. However, the cove|nant of grace may be con&s;idered as from everla&s;ting in the divine decree; and, however inami&s;&s;able we may &s;uppo&s;e their intere&s;t in it to be, who are vitally united to Chri&s;t; yet, as to the exter|nal revelation, application, and admini&s;tration of it in the vi&s;ible church, it is of no earlier a date than the vi&s;ible church which is
<PB N="51" REF="017187_0050_0FA07200CFE2C5C0">formed by it. And, it is certain, that un&s;anctified per&s;ons may be regularly admitted to, and cut off from an external and vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the covenant, and right to ordinances. And this is that view of the covenant which comes under our pre&s;ent con&s;idera|tion, as the ground of a vi&s;ible right to church privileges.</P>
<P>It is further objected, "That if the covenant with Abraham be not abrogated, as a part of the former admini&s;tration, circum|ci&s;ion mu&s;t &s;till remain in force." But this con&s;equence we deny. How can it be made to appear, that the external admini&s;tration of the vi&s;ible church cannot be changed, but by aboli&s;hing that gracious covenant, by which the church is formed; and &s;o di&s;|&s;olving the church it&s;elf. The apo&s;tles declare plainly, that we are free from the yoke of circumci&s;ion. But that the covenant with Abraham is di&s;annulled, or curtailed in any of the privileges it conveyed to the vi&s;ible church, they never once intimate, but declare to the contrary, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. We do not i|magine, that the change of the Sabbath from the &s;eventh to the
<PB N="52" REF="017187_0051_0FA072018EFD9DB0">fir&s;t day of the week, is any proof that the fourth commandment is repealed. How weakly then do men urge the change of the outward token of admi&s;&s;ion into the church from circumci&s;ion to bapti&s;m, as a proof that the covenant with Abraham is di&s;an|nulled.</P>
<P>But our opponents, <Q>deny, that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion.</Q> And if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e with them, that it does not, it would be no proof but that the covenant it&s;elf may remain though the outward token be laid a&s;ide, as it is certain that the &s;ame covenant for &s;ub&s;tance had been revealed to, and admini&s;tred in the church, long before circumci&s;ion was in&s;tituted. And if the covenant remain, infants are &s;till church members, and con&s;equently are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, as all church mem|bers are allowed to be. But, indeed, it is no better than wrang|ling to deny that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion: What we mean by the a&s;&s;ertion is, that circumci&s;ion being ab|rogated under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted to be an outward token of an intere&s;t in the new covenant, the &s;a|cramental rite of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, the &s;ign and badge of member&s;hip, even as circumci&s;ion had been to the fa|thers; and in a word, that it an&s;wers the like purpo&s;es in the go&s;pel church, and is of like my&s;tical and &s;piritual &s;ignificancy, as circumci&s;ion was under the former di&s;pen&s;ation. And this I &s;hould think our adver&s;aries can &s;carce deny. And, be&s;ides, the apo&s;tle terms bapti&s;m the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, or the chri&s;tian circumci&s;ion, Col. ii. 12. And he calls baptized chri&s;tians the Circumci&s;ion under the go&s;pel, as the people of God had been wont to be &s;tiled. Pail. iii. 3. And it is certain, that the primi|tive chri&s;tians viewed the matter in this light, and &s;peak of bap|ti&s;m as the go&s;pel circumci&s;ion. But we may have occa&s;ion to con&s;ider this point further in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Indeed, as circumci&s;ion was afterwards annexed to the Horeb covenant, and &s;o became an ordinance of the national church, and worldly &s;anctuary of the Jews, binding the &s;ubjects to the ob&s;ervance of the whole Mo&s;aic law, in this relation and re&s;pect, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e have cea&s;ed with the other Jewi&s;h ordinances, when that old covenant was abrogated&mdash;And if our opponents only mean to deny, that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circum|ci&s;ion, con&s;idered as a Mo&s;aic ordinance, we &s;hall not contend with them. But it &s;hould be remembered, that circumci&s;ion had been appointed as a token of the Abrahamic covenant, long be|fore the Horeb covenant and national con&s;titution of the church had a being. And I &s;hall &s;hew, that the Abrahamic covenant is the very &s;ame that the go&s;pel church is now under; and that it never was di&s;annulled.

<P>It is objected, <Q>That the apo&s;tle has declared, that the cove|nant, which was the foundation of the Jewi&s;h church, of which infants were members, is waxed old, and van &s;hed away.</Q> Heb. viii. 8, 9. I an&s;wer, The covenant which the apo&s;tle &s;ays was ready to vani&s;h, was that, which God made with the Fathers, in the day that he took them by the hand, to lead them out of Egypt; that is, the covenant at Horeb. But that covenant, which is the foundation of infant church member|&s;hip had been revealed to Abraham hundreds of years before; and the apo&s;tle does not &s;ay, that this had waxed old, or was di&s;an|nulled; but the contrary. Infants were indeed members of the national hierarchy of the Jews, which is aboli&s;hed. But they had been church members long before this national church was formed; nor was the foundation of their member&s;hip &s;haken, when that di&s;pen&s;ation was taken away.</P>
<P>There is another objection again&s;t our &s;uppo&s;ing that the Abrahamic covenant is that new covenant, which the go&s;pel church is under, which looks more plau&s;ible; though I do not find, that our opponents have made u&s;e of it: And that is, <Q>That the apo&s;tle calls the chri&s;tian covenant a new one, as compared with that old one, which was vani&s;hing. But it &s;eems we make this new covenant much older than the covenant of Horeb; even as old as Abraham, and nearly as old as the creation.</Q> But the an&s;wer is not difficult. Though the reve|lation of the new covenant was as early as the fir&s;t con&s;titution of a church in the world, and the grace and ble&s;&s;ings of it reached backward to the fathers in the earlie&s;t ages; yet the covenant it&s;elf was not ratified and &s;ealed, till the &s;hedding of Chri&s;t's blood. It was the death of the te&s;tater that confirmed the New Te&s;tament. This was long after the old covenant had been ra|tified and &s;ealed by the blood of bea&s;ts. At the &s;ealing the new covenant, the old began to vani&s;h. The apo&s;tle, therefore, very properly places the date of the new covenant at the time when it was &s;olemnly ratified and &s;ealed, and not when it was fir&s;t no|tified and promi&s;ed. The efficacy of the new covenant, as well as of Chri&s;t's &s;acrifice, extended to every pa&s;t age of the church; and they who died long before this &s;acrifice was offered, and this covenant &s;ealed, had an intere&s;t in them.&mdash;B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iefly then, the death of Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of di&s;annulling the covenant of Abraham, and the church member&s;hip of infants, has confirmed and ratified both; as I &s;hall now go on to prove; having thus far touched, and I hope, removed, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable objections to this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

Let it then be con&s;idered, that the covenant of Abraham, con|taining a charter of privileges for the church, and the right of member&s;hip for infant children, being an undoubted privilege granted in this covenant; it mu&s;t be pre&s;umptuous and injurious for any to deny that this covenant &s;tands in force, or to pretend, that infants are now cut off from this right and privilege, unle&s;s they can prove, that God has taken away this covenant, or at lea&s;t has cancelled that article, which is the foundation of infant church member&s;hip. But there is no intimation in the &s;criptures that this covenant is di&s;annulled, or that infants are cut off from their intere&s;t in it. The old covenant, which the apo&s;tle &s;ays was vani&s;hing, was the covenant made with the I&s;raelites, when God led them out of Egypt, as has been &s;hewn. But of the abo|li&s;hing that covenant which con&s;titutes infants, church members, there is nothing to be found in the whole bible. And, till it can be proved to be aboli&s;hed, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered and held as valid as ever.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved, That this is called an everla&s;ting Covenant, Gen. xvii. 7. which would be a deci&s;ive proof, that it was not di&s;annulled, were it not that we find the word, Ever|la&s;ting, in &s;cripture, &s;ometimes &s;ignifying a limited duration. But it mu&s;t at lea&s;t &s;ignify, that this covenant was to continue till it was taken away by the &s;ame divine authority, by which it was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. And as we find no &s;ort of evidence that if has either been vacated or abridged, we conculde that it &s;till abides in full force.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tles are &s;o far from teaching, that Chri&s;t has di&s;annull|ed God's gracious covenant with the fathers, or taken away any of the privileges therein granted to them or their children, that Paul a&s;&s;erts to the contrary, in Rom. xv. 8. <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a mini&s;ter of the circumci&s;ion for the truth of God, to confirm the promi&s;es made to the fathers.</Q> The&s;e promi&s;es are &s;um|marily contained in the covenant with Abraham, that the Lord would be a God to him and his &s;eed; that he &s;hould be a father of many nations; and that all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in him. The&s;e promi&s;es are all confirmed by Chri&s;t. Abraham is the patriarch of the church. He is con&s;tituted the father of all them that believe; of all the people of God, of every nation; who are adopted into his family. Even the Gen|tiles, who were not his natural de&s;cendants, are received into the number, and entitled to the privileges of his children. He is made the father of more nations, than are derived from his blood. All the nations of the earth derive ble&s;&s;ings from him, and hold their church privileges under him, as his children and heirs. The covenant with Abraham, has indeed, been accompli&s;hed, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince Chri&s;t confirmed it, than ever before. His fami|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been larger, and he has been made a father of more nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. This article of the covenant, which receives the

It would be mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to think otherwi&s;e, when the &s;criptures never hint that this article is re&s;cinded.&mdash; And we have be&s;ides, good evidence, that the chri&s;tian church has not lo&s;t this privilege, but their children are &s;till children of the covenant, to greater advantage than ever.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle tells us again, that <Q>The covenant with Abraham was confirmed of God in Chri&s;t, and that the law which was 430 years after, could not di&s;annul it.</Q> Gal. iii. 17. And will any yet in&s;inuate, that Chri&s;t has di&s;annulled this covenant, which God confirmed in him? This would overthrow the apo&s;tle's ar|gument; who confutes the error of the Judaizing teachers about ju&s;tification, by the &s;tability of the Abrahamic covenant: which would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onclu&s;ive, if that covenant was not in force

<P>Indeed, the third chapter to the Galatians, and fourth to the Romans are a proof, that the covenant with Abraham abides in force, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and that Gentile believers, with their children, have an intere&s;t in it, which can never be evaded.

The covenant with Abraham contains a grant of external church privileges, and al&s;o of &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings, to his children and heirs, that is the church. The &s;piritual children of Abraham (if we may u&s;e the term of di&s;tinction) are the invi&s;ible church, who are in God's ac|count heirs according to the promi&s;e, to whom the &s;pecial grace of the covenant is &s;avingly applied. But, as the &s;piritual &s;eed are known only to God, and as it is the will of God to have a vi&s;ible church, in which his ordinances &s;hould be outwardly ad|mini&s;tred by men, according to rules by him pre&s;cribed; &s;o he has given direction, that all tho&s;e who are vi&s;ibly and in the ac|count of the church children and heirs of Abraham, or church members, &s;hould be admitted to the outward ordinances and pri|vileges of God's covenanted people. And God has plainly de|clared, that all the natural po&s;terity of Abraham in their gene|rations, were to be received as his heirs, members of the vi&s;ible church, and in human acceptation intere&s;ted in that covenant, in which it was promi&s;ed, that he would be a God to him and his &s;eed. All the&s;e, I &s;ay, were vi&s;ibly heirs of Abraham, until di&s;inherited or cut off from his family by divine direction. And not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the natural po&s;terity, but all others, who &s;hould de&s;ire to join with them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h and wor&s;hip of the true God, were al&s;o to be reputed and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed together with their children, as heirs of Abraham by adoption&mdash;And accordingly, he became the adoptive father of many nations, be&s;ides his natural de&s;cen|dants. Now, as believers are the children and heirs of Abraham, as Paul &s;ays, and as the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is come upon the Gentiles, their natural po&s;terity mu&s;t &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing exactly with the children of the other heirs, and &s;o are to be ac|counted and admitted as vi&s;ible heirs of tho&s;e privileges which were entailed upon the family of Abraham in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. For the covenant contained an intail of the &s;ame outward privileges on the children of tho&s;e heirs: It conveyed the right of heir&s;hip to them and their &s;eed, until they &s;hould be di&s;inherited by divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> order.&mdash;As therefore the natural po&s;terity of Abraham were certa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y vi&s;ibly in covenant, and as &s;uch had a right to the ordinances and privileges of the church, though many of them were not, in God's account, the &s;piritual children of Abraham, &s;o are al&s;o the natural po&s;terity of all believers who are al&s;o the children and heirs of Abraham: the intail of the&s;e privileges on the children being an article of the covenant of Abraham, and a part of that ble&s;&s;ing of his which is come up|on the Gentiles&mdash;Nor is this ble&s;&s;ing any otherwi&s;e re&s;tricted to the &s;piritual &s;eed now than it had been all along. Though in God's account all were not I&s;rael that were of I&s;rael, yet in the account of the church, and with re&s;pect to an external right to church privileges, they all &s;tood upon a level. Though the &s;pe|cial grace of the covenant is &s;ecured only to the &s;piritual &s;eed, yet the outward privileges of communion with the vi&s;ible church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">long to all who are vi&s;ibly intere&s;ted in the covenant, and &s;o in human account the heirs of Abraham, that is, to pro|fe&s;&s;ed believers, and their children. In fine, as the old cove|nant was made with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, including the little ones, as the phra&s;e commonly &s;ignifies, and as all acknowledge, &s;o the new covenant is al&s;o made with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, Heb. viii. 8, 9, and &s;o mu&s;t, in like manner, include the whole family, even the infants of confederate believers.&mdash;Salvation comes to their hou&s;e, as Chri&s;t &s;aid to Zaccheus; that is, to their family, according to that promi&s;e, Jer. xxx. 20. Their children &s;hall be as aforetime, that is, children and heirs of the covenant. And accordingly it is promi&s;ed in that mo&s;t remarkable prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles into the go&s;pel church, I&s;a. xlix. 22. that God would lift up his hand to the Gentiles, and &s;et up his &s;tandard to the people, and they &s;hould bring the &s;ons of Zion, or the members of the church, in their arms, &amp;c. as infants are wont to be car|ried.&mdash;A plain intimation that the go&s;pel church was to receive infants.</NOTE>. And this &s;eems to

<PB N="58" REF="017187_0057_0FA072060DC089D0">they &s;hould be taken into that &s;ame church, and enjoy the pri|vileges of that &s;ame covenant, in which the children of Abraham were born and lived.

However, it matters little how we take this text, as long as we have much clearer and more convictive proofs in the New Te&s;tament, that Chri&s;tians with their children are taken into the &s;ame covenant and church in which Abra|ham and his &s;eed had an intere&s;t and &s;tanding.&mdash;Two or three more I will mention, which are, I think, very full to this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In Rom. xi. 16, 17, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>If the root be holy &s;o are the branches.</Q> By the root we are to under&s;tand the pa|triarchs, the fathers of the Jews; and the branches are their de|&s;cendants. The patriarchs were holy as being in covenant, and members of the church; and their children the natural branches, are al&s;o holy in this re&s;pect. For, they were al&s;o comprehended in the covenant and church with their parents. It is a federal ho|line&s;s, the holine&s;s of church member&s;hip, or a vi&s;ible &s;eparation and dedication to God, that is here attributed both to the root and branches. They being of the vi&s;ible church, were called a holy people; and the outward ordinances and privileges of the church were theirs. Inherent &s;anctification is not the holine&s;s here meant. For that is not derived from parents to children by natural generation. The branches are not therefore the &s;ubjects of &s;aving grace, becau&s;e the root is &s;o. But, if the root, or the pa|rents, are federally holy, as being of the church, and intere&s;ted in the covenant; &s;o are the branches, or the children: For the&s;e al&s;o are in the covenant, and of the church. This was undoubt|edly the ca&s;e in the Old Te&s;tament church, as all allow. They were born church members. The branches were as much &s;o as the root. If the former were holy, the latter were &s;o of con&s;e|quence; and the token of church member&s;hip was put upon them in their infancy. The Apo&s;tle goes on, <Q>If &s;ome of the branches (that is, the unbelieving Jews) were broken off, and thou, (a Gentile) being a wild olive, wert graffed in among them, and
<PB N="59" REF="017187_0058_0FA07207C1503E20">with them partake&s;t of the root and fatne&s;s of the olive tree; boa&s;t not.</Q> Though the branches had the federal holine&s;s of church members, yet they were liable to be bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en off. Thus it befel the greater part of the Jews: They were by their unbe|lief broken off from the &s;tock they before &s;tood upon, that is, the church. They lo&s;t their &s;tanding therein, and the privileges of members: And the Gentiles were graffed in to the &s;ame olive, from which the unbelieving Jews were broken. They were ta|ken into that very covenant and church, along wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the believ|ing Jews, who were the natural branches, that never were bro|ken off, but maintained their &s;tanding. The olive tree of the church, &s;pringing from Abraham as its roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, on patriarch, and con&s;tituted by the Abrahamic covenant, was not cut down, and a new one planted. The church, which had &s;tood from the ear|ly ages of the world, was not di&s;&s;olved, and a new one formed up|on a foundation and plan entirely different: But the Gentiles were graffed in along with the believing Jews, who were the only living and &s;ound branches that remained, after the unbelieving Jews were broken off. They became the adopted children of A|braham, were taken into the church, which was &s;till con&s;idered as his family. The olive tree &s;till &s;tood upon the &s;ame root as be|fore; and the Gentile converts were admitted into the &s;ame co|venant, were laid under its bonds, and ve&s;ted with all its privi|leges, to as great advantage as if they had been the natural branches, or de&s;cendants from the holy fathers. This is what is meant, by their "partaking of the root and fatne&s;s of the o|live." The unbelieving Jews could not po&s;&s;ibly be broken off from any church, but that which was formed by the Abrahamic covenant, of which infants were certainly members; for they ne|ver belonged to any other. The Gentiles were graffed into the &s;ame tree, from which the others had been broken. They par|took of the &s;ame root and fatne&s;s; that is, were endowed with the &s;ame covenant privileges. Which is a full proof, that the cove|nant with Abraham is not aboli&s;hed, but remains in force, and that the church con&s;tituted by it, of which infants were undoubt|ed members, was not di&s;&s;olved; but that the Chri&s;tian Gentiles are taken into it, along with the believing Jews, who &s;till remain|ed in it; and the children of the believing Gentiles &s;till had the &s;ame right and privilege of church member&s;hip which Abraham's po&s;terity had all along. And this is agreeable to the warning which Chri&s;t gave the Jews. Matth. xxi. 43. <Q>The kingdom of God &s;hall be taken from you, and given to a nation that &s;hall bring forth the fruits thereof.</Q> The &s;ame kingdom of God, or church privileges, which were taken from the Jews, were given undimini&s;hed, to the Gentiles. To this we may add tho&s;e words, Matth. viii. 11. <Q>Many &s;hall come from the ea&s;t and the we&s;t, and &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God.</Q> That is, the Gentiles &s;hall be taken into
<PB N="60" REF="017187_0059_0FA072084DDF1620">the family of Abraham; into the &s;ame covenant and church privileges with them, (&s;o the words are expounded by &s;ome good interpreters) <Q>but the children of the kingdom, (the unbeliev|ing Jews) &s;hall be ca&s;t out (of the church) into outer darkne&s;s;</Q> they &s;hall be abandoned and given up to ignorance, blindne&s;s, and infidelity, like the heathen, who are without; as well as puni&s;h|ed by terrible plagues in this world, and by the fire of God's wrath, which &s;hall burn to the lowe&s;t hell; under which they &s;hall weep, and wail, and gna&s;h their teeth for rage and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>The exceptions of the Antepedobapti&s;ts to this argument are of no weight. They deny that the Gentile converts were taken into the Jewi&s;h church, which, they &s;ay, was aboli&s;hed and taken away. 'Tis true, the national church &s;tate, formed by the covenant of Horeb, was taken away, as well as the political go|vernment of the Jews. But the church of God, formed by the covenant with Abraham, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long before. Nor was this covenant di&s;annulled by that of Horeb, as the apo&s;tle teach|es. The Gentiles were graffed into that olive, or church, from which the Jews were broken off: and that mu&s;t be the Jewi&s;h church as con&s;tituted by the Abrahamic covenant. Though the Mo&s;aic hierarchy was falling, the church &s;tood firm under that &s;ame covenant by which it had been formed long before that hi|erarchy was erected. This is that covenant on which the church member&s;hip of infants is founded; out of which the unbelieving Jews were ca&s;t; and into which the Gentiles were taken.</P>
<P>Some have pretended that <Q>Chri&s;t is the holy root, and Chri&s;tians are the branches, which the apo&s;tle here means.</Q> But this is manife&s;tly ab&s;urd. For then we mu&s;t &s;ay, that &s;ome of Chri&s;t's branches are broken off; that is, the infidel Jews, who never were in Chri&s;t, no not &s;o much as by an outward pro|fe&s;&s;ion of faith in him.</P>
<P>But the more common pretence is, <Q>That the go&s;pel church, con&s;tituted at fir&s;t of believing Jews, is the olive, into which the Gentile converts were graffed.</Q> But how could the unbe|lieving Jews be broken off from the Chri&s;tian church, when they never were in or of it? To this it is only &s;aid, that the unbeliev|ing Jews were left out of the church. What! Is that a break|ing off? A &s;trange fancy! A new, unheard of way of breaking off what never was on. Is the Chri&s;tian church their own olive tree, and are they the natural branches who never were branches of it at all; never were in it?</P>
<P>It is indeed a matter of patience, to &s;ee how heroically men who are devoted to their &s;chemes, will kick again&s;t the pricks, and affirm and deny almo&s;t any thing, rather than give them up. The plaine&s;t and mo&s;t pointed &s;cripture te&s;timonies that &s;tand directly in oppo&s;ition to them, avail nothing. New &s;en&s;es, never heard of before, mu&s;t be forced on common words.

<PB N="61" REF="017187_0060_0FA072090CFED3F8">what was never in; rather than infants be allowed any place in the church. In this way of managing a debate, people never need fear being convinced. They are out of the reach of argu|ment.</P>
<P>But, let us once more hear what the &s;cripture &s;ays.&mdash;When tho&s;e, who were pricked in their hearts, on the day of Penteco&s;t, &s;aid to Peter and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do? Peter &s;aid unto them, <Q>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For the promi&s;e is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</Q> Acts ii. 38, 39. That it was the covenant with Abraham, that is here called the promi&s;e, will appear from the following con&s;iderations.&mdash; 1. This covenant is commonly in the New Te&s;tament called the Promi&s;e, by way of di&s;tinction and eminency. See Rom. iv. 13, 14. <Q>For the Promi&s;e, that he &s;hould be heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his &s;eed, through the law, but through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith. For, if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the Promi&s;e of none effect. There|fore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end that the Promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</Q> Gal. iii. 17. and on, <Q>The covenant which was before confirmed of God in Chri&s;t, the law which was 430 years after cannot di&s;annul, that it &s;hould make the Promi&s;e of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promi&s;e, but God gave it to Abraham by Promi&s;e. If ye are Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abra|ham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the Promi&s;e.</Q> Once more. Gal. iv. 28. "We, as I&s;aac, are children of the Promi&s;e."</P>
<P>In all the&s;e places, and in divers others, the covenant with Abraham is called the Promi&s;e; which &s;hews that it was com|monly &s;o &s;tiled. 2. If we compare this text with Acts ii. 25. we &s;hall find the promi&s;e there explained, to mean the covenant with Abraham. For the apo&s;tle, there addre&s;&s;ing the Jews, to per&s;uade them to repent and be converted, in like manner as he had done on the day of Penteco&s;t, propo&s;es the very &s;ame en|couragement to them in the&s;e words: <Q>Ye are the children of the covenant which God made with our fathers, Saying unto Abraham, and in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the kindreds of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> His telling them that <Q>they were the children of Abraham's covenant,</Q> is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e exactly, as if he had told them, that the Promi&s;e was to them and their children. For this covenant was undoubtedly to the parents and their in|fant children. And their being declared children of the covenant, &s;ignified that they were heirs to the privileges of the covenant. So that the&s;e texts are exactly parallel, and explain each other.
<PB N="62" REF="017187_0061_0FA07209CD1A56F0">The &s;ame apo&s;tle, preaching to the &s;ame &s;ort of hearers, (that is the Jews) propo&s;es the &s;ame argument in different words, even their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e, or covenant with Abraham, in or|der to enforce the &s;ame exhortation, viz. Repentance and con|ver&s;ion for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. So that we cannot rea&s;onably doubt, whether the promi&s;e here &s;poken of, be not the covenant with Abraham, if we will allow the apo&s;tle to explain his own words. 3. What the apo&s;tle here &s;ays of the prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, agrees ex|actly in every particular, with the Abrahamic covenant, which had all along included the po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erity of Abraham and their infant children, together with the Gentiles that were afar off, even as many of them, as the Lord did from time to time call into his church, and who, in obedience to this call, became pro&s;elytes, or Comers, as the word properly &s;ignifies.&mdash;All, who upon the di|vine call, Came from afar to join them&s;elves to the Lord, and his people, were received, together with their children, into the church and covenant by circumci&s;ion; and the promi&s;e was to them and their children al&s;o, as has been ob&s;erved. The cove|nant of Abraham, did belong to all tho&s;e, who were in, and of the church. Peter's hearers, with their children, being actual mem|bers in the church, did not need a new call into the church, in order to their being the children of the covenant and promi&s;e. But, with the Gentiles who were afar off, and out of the church, the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e. They mu&s;t fir&s;t be called in, and become pro&s;elytes, before the promi&s;e would be to them and theirs. But &s;o many as were thus called, and admitted into the family of Abraham, had an intere&s;t in the covenant and promi&s;e, as well as the Jews. Thus the ca&s;e had &s;tood all along according to the Abrahamic covenant; and thus the ca&s;e &s;tood upon the day of Penteco&s;t, as Peter &s;ays. Which &s;hews that it was this co|venant that Peter had in his eye, when he &s;aid, "The promi&s;e is to you and your children." That his words are therefore to be explained according to the tenor of the Abrahamic covenant: That this covenant, which is the foundation of infant church member&s;hip, was not then aboli&s;hed; but &s;tood in force: And I pre&s;ume no one will &s;ay it has been ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;hed &s;ince.</P>
<P>In this manner Peter's hearers mu&s;t have under&s;tood his words. They had been born and bred in that church and covenant, which included both parents and children. They knew that in|fants had always been acknowledged as church members, ever &s;ince a church had been formed in the world. The idea of a church which &s;hould not admit the children with the parents, would have been as new and &s;irange to them, as a church that would not admit females, would be to us. A promi&s;e, or cove|nant conveying, privileges to them and their children, would be naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by them in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e pro|mi&s;es in the Old Te&s;tament, which &s;o often occur in the &s;ame form of expre&s;&s;ion, had con&s;tantly been taken; and particularly
<PB N="63" REF="017187_0062_0FA0720A8C620B40">the promi&s;e to Abraham, which was the mo&s;t eminent and funda|mental. They would as naturally conclude that their young children are immediately re&s;pected, as we &s;hould conclude ours to be in an in&s;trument, conveying privileges to us and our heirs; and they would have no doubt, that a grant of privileges was here a&s;&s;erted to the children of tho&s;e who were in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant and church, more than to the children of heathens. Now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the words of the apo&s;tle would carry this meaning mo&s;t naturally and obviou&s;ly to the under&s;tanding of his hearers, and as the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> form of expre&s;&s;ion el&s;ewhere is con&s;tantly to be thus under&s;tood, and no rea&s;on appears why it may not be taken here in the &s;ame &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e; this mu&s;t in all rea&s;on be received as the true interpreta|tion. And if this promi&s;e belonged to the infant children of the inchurched and covenanted Jews, at the day of Penteco&s;t, none will deny that it &s;till belongs to the children of the Gentiles, who were afar off; even as many as it plea&s;es the Lord to call into his go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e Peter holds up to the Jews, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a warrant or rea|&s;on why they &s;hould be baptized in the name of Chri&s;t. Repent and be baptized; For the promi&s;e is to you, &amp;c. Now if their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e was a good rea&s;on why they &s;hould be baptized, as the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts; then their childrens having an intere&s;t in the promi&s;e with them (as is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted) is as good a rea&s;on for their being baptized; even as an intere&s;t in the cove|nant was a rea&s;on for circumci&s;ion to Abraham and his children.</P>
<P>This text is then a &s;ub&s;tantial proof that the covenant of Abra|ham &s;tood in force, after the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation took place: Since this appears to be that very promi&s;e which Peter addre&s;&s;es to his hearers. And we &s;ee that that particular clau&s;e, which contains a grant of the privilege of church member&s;hip to the children of God's people was not taken out, when <Q>Chri&s;t the mini&s;ter of the circumci&s;ion confirmed by his death the promi&s;es made to the fathers.</Q> We then, and all others, whom God &s;hall call into his church, together with our children, as the adopted children and heirs of Abraham, have an intere&s;t in this promi&s;e; are mem|bers of the go&s;pel church; and the proper &s;ubjects of chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The eva&s;ions of this proof of infants church member&s;hip and intere&s;t in the covenant, which our opponents have invented, are unnatural, improbable and ab&s;urd. They would per&s;uade us, <Q>That the Promi&s;e here &s;poken of was not the covenant with Abraham, but the promi&s;e of the pouring out of the &s;pirit in Joel.</Q> But how can this be, when the apo&s;tle &s;ays that the prophecy of Joel foretold tho&s;e miraculous gifts of the &s;pirit, &s;peaking with tongues, and prophe&s;ying, which appeared on the day of Penteco&s;t? Are the&s;e gifts promi&s;ed to, and conferred upon all, whom the Lord &s;hall call? Be&s;ides, I have proved, that the Promi&s;e here mentioned, was the covenant with Abraham;
<PB N="64" REF="017187_0063_0FA0720B4DC1AAE0">and till the rea&s;ons adduced are &s;hewn to be without weight, it is folly to &s;et up an unproved a&s;&s;ertion in oppo&s;ition to them. But whatever the promi&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, it belonged to Peter's hearers, and their children, as he &s;ays; and he holds it up to them as a rea&s;on for their being baptized. It mu&s;t there|fore be a rea&s;on for the bapti&s;m of their children al&s;o. If the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t was promi&s;ed to them, it was to their children. And they were to be con&s;idered as &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m on ac|count of the promi&s;e; not becau&s;e the gifts of the &s;pirit were manife&s;t in them, but in order to their receiving the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For it is to be ob&s;erved, that the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t is propo&s;ed as the con&s;equence, and not the pre-requi&s;ite of bapti&s;m. <Q>Be baptized, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;i.</Q></P>
<P>But to give this plea the greate&s;t advantage, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the pouring out of the &s;pirit in his ordinary &s;anctifying influences is the matter of that promi&s;e in Joel; though Peter explains it otherwi&s;e: And that this is the promi&s;e, which he, in this text propo&s;es to his hearers, as re&s;pecting them and their children, though we have &s;een him explain him&s;elf otherwi&s;e.&mdash;Our argu|ment from the&s;e words, would yet &s;tand good. For the promi&s;e of the &s;anctifying &s;pirit being included in the ble&s;&s;ing of Abra|ham, as the apo&s;tle plainly teaches us, in Gal. iii. 14. and it be|ing &s;everal times particularly promi&s;ed to the &s;eed of God's co|venanted people, (The Lord will circumci&s;e thy heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed. I will pour my &s;pirit on thy &s;eed, &amp;c.) We may hence infer, that they to whom this promi&s;e belongs, are intere&s;ted in the covenant and ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, and may properly be recognized as of the church and people of God.</P>
<P>And in the &s;aith and hope of the accompi&s;hment of this pro|mi&s;e, God's covenanted people &s;hould dedicate their infant &s;eed to him, and have the token of his gracious covenant put upon them.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, <Q>That the children to whom the promi&s;e belongs, are not infants, but adults&mdash;the po&s;terity of the Jews.</Q> But though adults are the children of their parents, yet infants too are doubtle&s;s children. What warrant then have any to deny that they have an intere&s;t in that promi&s;e, which is to the children indefinitely, without any exception of infants?</P>
<P>But the eva&s;ion which is mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on, is, <Q>That the pro|mi&s;e is re&s;trained to tho&s;e only, whom the Lord &s;hall call: and infants give no evidence of their being called.</Q> But this will not bear examination. I have already &s;hewn, that this pro|mi&s;e was the covenant with Abraham, and is therefore to be ex|plained according to the tenor of that covenant, which included him and his children, and &s;o many of the Gentiles as God &s;hould from time to time call into his church. The calling of Abraham was a &s;ufficient call to all his po&s;terity, to give them a vi&s;ible in|tere&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="017187_0064_0FA0720C0DC573A0">in the covenant, and &s;tanding in the church, till they for|feited and were cut off from this privilege. The re&s;training clau&s;e, therefore, only re&s;pected tho&s;e who were not yet called into the church of God, and not tho&s;e Jews and their children who were then actual members and children of the covenant Repentance and bapti&s;m, in the name of Chri&s;t, were required to prevent their being cut off from the covenant, and family of Abraham; but the promi&s;e was then to them and their children. There is a plain rea&s;on why the promi&s;e &s;hould re&s;pect only &s;o many of tho&s;e, who are without, as the Lord &s;hould call. But how ab&s;urdly would the apo&s;tle &s;peak, according to the interpretation which the Antepedobapti&s;ts put upon his words. <Q>The promi&s;e is to you and your children. But neither you, nor your chil|dren appear at pre&s;ent, to have any intere&s;t in it; and no one knows, that they ever will have. You are not to imagine that either you or your children are entitled to any privilege by it, more than belongs to every man and child in the world. All that I mean is, that the promi&s;e will belong to tho&s;e who &s;hall be called. If this &s;hould prove to be the ca&s;e with any of you, or of your children, or any other per&s;on, then, and not till then, the promi&s;e will be to you and them.</Q> If this be all that is intended, it had been much more plainly expre&s;&s;ed by only &s;ay|in, "The promi&s;e will be to tho&s;e, whom the Lord &s;hall call." To what purpo&s;e is all this flouri&s;h of words, without meaning? What end can this particular mention of them, and their children, as intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, &s;erve, unle&s;s to per&s;uade them, that &s;ome &s;pecial privilege belonged to them, while there was nothing at all in it? It is either in&s;ignificant, or fallacious; and would convey to the under&s;tanding of the hearers either no meaning, or a fal&s;e one

Suppo&s;e it were declared, that all the privileges contained in our frame of government belonged to the native &s;ubjects and their children, and al&s;o to foreigners, even as many as the government &s;hould naturalize; and &s;ome one pretending to give the &s;en&s;e of this declaration &s;hould contend, that according to it, neither the native &s;ubjects, nor their children, had a right to any of the&s;e pri|vileges, unle&s;s they &s;hould be fir&s;t naturalized by an act of the government; would he not be thought ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd? The adver&s;aries of infant church member&s;hip, are equally ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable, in their way of explaining the apo&s;tle's words.</P>
<P>The argument from this text we have &s;o long been con&s;idering, cannot be evaded. And we may further add, that &s;ince it is on all hands allowed to have been a great privilege of the Jewi&s;h in|fants, that they were in the covenant and church of God; if the infants of chri&s;tians are left out of the church, as our opponents teach, then the go&s;pel church is deprived of an important privi|lege, which the Jewi&s;h church enjoyed: And its con&s;titution is le&s;s favourable to infants. Formerly, they were children of the covenant, and the people of God; and as &s;uch had many great and precious promi&s;es made to them, for the comfort and encourage|ment of their parents and them. But now, if we will hearken to &s;ome men, they are all to be ranked with the children of tho&s;e, who are &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e, who are without hope, and without God in the world: And the uncovenanted mercy of God is the only ground of hope that remains for them. If it were a privilege to the Jewi&s;h infants to be members of the church of God, no good rea&s;on can be given, why a right of mem|ber&s;hip in the church &s;hould not &s;till be as great a privilege to the infants of chri&s;tians. But can we believe, that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation has dimini&s;hed the privileges of the church in any in&s;tance; or that it has put any cla&s;s of mankind, whether in|fants or adults, in a more di&s;advantageous &s;tate than before; de|priving them, without any fault of theirs, of their &s;tanding in the church of God, which is acknowledged to have been an impor|tant privilege? This ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, unle&s;s clear and po&s;itive proof of it could be produced. But no &s;uch proof has been or can be found. Wherefore, to bring this argument to a point: The privilege of church member&s;hip has certainly been granted to the infant children of God's profe&s;&s;ing people; which grant &s;tands in force till it be revoked. Our opponents have of|ten been called upon to produce an authentic act of revocation, and the demand is rea&s;onable. This they cannot do. On the
<PB N="67" REF="017187_0066_0FA0720D8C047A20">contrary, we demon&s;trate, that this grant has not been revoked, but is renewed, confirmed, and ratified in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>As a proper appendix to what has thus far been di&s;cour&s;ed of the intere&s;t of infants in the church covenant, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention that common argument from bapti&s;m &s;ucceeding in the room of circumci&s;ion; but &s;hall not enlarge upon it. As infants were the &s;ubjects of circumci&s;ion, and were recognized and marked as the people of God by this rite, the conclu&s;ion is very natural and rea&s;onable, that if bapti&s;m comes in the place of circumci&s;ion, as the token of admi&s;&s;ion into the church, infants are the proper &s;ubjects of this ordinance; unle&s;s God has declared to the contra|ry; which can never be made to appear. It is indeed denied by our opponents, that bapti&s;m does come in the place of circumci|&s;ion. But I cannot find that they have explained them&s;elves di&s;|tinctly, how far, and in what re&s;pect, they mean to deny it. I own that bapti&s;m does not an&s;wer all the &s;ame purpo&s;es under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, that circumci&s;ion did under the Mo&s;aic. It does not introduce the &s;ubjects into a national church, and wordly &s;anctuary. It has not a typical re&s;pect to the Saviour to come. It is not a yoke of bondage, obliging to the ob&s;ervance of the carnal ordinances of the law of Mo&s;es. And our oppo|nents, if they will be ingenuous and rea&s;onable, mu&s;t allow that bapti&s;m does, in many re&s;pects, come in the place of circumci&s;ion. It an&s;wers &s;imilar ends in the go&s;pel church; and is of the &s;ame general &s;ignification; and is to be applied to the &s;ame &s;ubjects, that is, church members; and has even the &s;ame name given to it; and upon the in&s;titution of bapti&s;m, as an ordinance of &s;tand|ing and univer&s;al obligation, circumci&s;ion was no longer the to|ken of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, as it had been before. And this is all we mean, when we a&s;&s;ert, that bapti&s;m &s;ucceeds to circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>As circumci&s;ion was the outward token of the covenant, and of admi&s;&s;ion into the church; &s;o bapti&s;m is the token of church member&s;hip, and of an intere&s;t in the new covenant; which I have proved, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame with that of Abraham, to which circumci&s;ion was annexed. They are both the appoint|ed &s;ign and badge of the people of God. As circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith to Abraham, &s;o is bapti&s;m to chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Again, circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m though different in external rites are alike in their &s;piritual &s;ignification. They both point|ed out our native corruption, and need of purification, by an in|ward and &s;piritual renovation. They both &s;ignified clean&s;ing from the guilt and defilement of &s;in by the blood of Chri&s;t, an admi&s;&s;ion into the church&mdash;a dedication to God, an obligation to walk in his commandments and ordinances, and a right to covenant privileges.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="017187_0067_0FA0720E4D7D5A98">
It is further to be ob&s;erved, that bapti&s;m in the New Te&s;ta|ment bears the name of the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, or the chri&s;|tian circumci&s;ion. Col. ii. 11, 12. And the apo&s;tle calls chri&s;tians the Circumci&s;ion, under the go&s;pel; which was the common ap|pellation of tho&s;e, who had under the former di&s;pen&s;ation, re|ceived the token of induction into the church. A &s;ufficient inti|mation that the one takes the place of the other.</P>
<P>Accordingly, circumci&s;ion cea&s;ed to be longer the token of church member&s;hip, after Chri&s;t &s;ent out his apo&s;tles to preach and baptize in his name, when bapti&s;m was made the &s;tanding rite of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, we cannot but con&s;ider bapti&s;m as taking that place in the go&s;pel oeconomy, in which circumci&s;ion &s;tood under the old di&s;pen&s;ation; though we readily allow that each of the&s;e ordinances had &s;ome peculiar ends and &s;ignifications, &s;uited to the different &s;tates of the church, in which they were re&s;pec|tively in force; in re&s;pect of which peculiarities they may not properly be parallel. And hence we argue, that &s;ince circum|ci&s;ion and bapti&s;m are manife&s;tly &s;imilar in their main ends, u&s;es and &s;ignificancies; infants are as proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, as they were of circumci&s;ion; and that the divine order for admi|ni&s;tring the one ordinance to them, warrants our admini&s;tring that other ordinance that comes in its roam. And the argu|ment is not only popular, but of real weight; though I do not lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>But it is objected: <Q>That the &s;criptures do not &s;ay, that hap|ti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion.</Q> I an&s;wer, Paul's terming bapti&s;m the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, is a plain intimation to this purpo&s;e. And the rea&s;ons I have adduced, which are grounded on the &s;cripture, are a &s;ufficient evidence of the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, as it has been explained.</P>
<P>It is further objected, <Q>That the outward rites are very un|like.</Q> But I can &s;ee no weight in this. The different &s;tates of the church under the Old and New Te&s;tament might require this difference of outward admini&s;tration re&s;pecting the initiating rite.</P>
<P>It is further objected, <Q>That the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m and cir|cumci&s;ion were different. Circumci&s;ion was to be admini&s;tred only to males, bapti&s;m to both &s;exes.</Q> I an&s;wer. The circumci|&s;ion of the males was the appointed token of church member&s;hip to the people of God of both &s;exes. The females were account|ed of the circumci&s;ion; and were admitted to the holy ordi|nances which were interdicted to the uncircumci&s;ed and unclean.</P>
<P>It is objected again, <Q>That bapti&s;m was in u&s;e and force before circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed.</Q> I an&s;wer. Though bapti&s;m was admini&s;tred by John, and the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, a &s;hort time before circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed, yet this no more proves that the former &s;ucceeds not in the room of the latter, than Solo|mon's
<PB N="69" REF="017187_0068_0FA0720F0BA97170">reigning with his father a &s;hort time, is a proof that he did not &s;ucceed and reign in his &s;tead. But though bapti&s;m was in u&s;e before, it was not fully e&s;tabli&s;hed as the rite of induction into the church, till the mi&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles; after which, circum|ci&s;ion was no longer required for that purpo&s;e, as it had been be|fore; though for other rea&s;ons it continued in u&s;e among the be|lieving Jews &s;ome years longer.</P>
<P>It is further inquired, <Q>What need there was that tho&s;e who had been circumci&s;ed &s;hould be baptized, if they are both ordi|nances of the &s;ame u&s;e and &s;ignificancy.</Q> I an&s;wer, It was the will of Chri&s;t, that all his di&s;ciples &s;hould receive the new token and badge of church member&s;hip, although they had been admit|ted members of the Old Te&s;tament church. And &s;uch as would not recognize them&s;elves as his di&s;ciples, were to be rejected, and unchurched, and be as branches broken off by their unbelief. Their circumci&s;ion became uncircumci&s;ion, and the token of their being the people of God became null and void.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things I pa&s;s over briefly. For, though I think they are well worthy of con&s;ideration, yet they may not be of &s;o much importance in the main argument, as many have been apt to &s;up|po&s;e&mdash;But after all, &s;ome may think the doctrine we plead for will involve us in an un&s;urmountable difficulty. For, it may be &s;aid, <Q>the new covenant contains a grant, not only of external privileges, but of all &s;piritual and &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings; and &s;o mu&s;t &s;ecure eternal Salvation to all that have an intere&s;t in it. But can we think that all the &s;eed of vi&s;ible or real believers will be finally &s;aved? And to &s;ay that the covenant grant is condition|al, if they perform the duties required on their part, will not help the matter. For if &s;uch a conditional grant be all, this is not peculiar to the &s;eed of believers, but the &s;ame conditional promi&s;e is made to all mankind. And be&s;ides, it is to be re|membred that whatever conditions may be &s;uppo&s;ed in the new covenant grant, there is an effectual provi&s;ion made in the promi&s;e of all that grace that is needful to work in us to will and to do whatever is required of us in order to &s;alvation. So that &s;till the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in the cove|nant, &s;eems to be as &s;ure and &s;table as the covenant it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this objection, I would &s;ay, that the new cove|venant does indeed contain a grant of all &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings to be|lievers and their &s;eed, but with this difference: All true believ|ers have a firm promi&s;e of all &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings for them&s;elves, whereby eternal &s;alvation is &s;ecured to them. The &s;ame ble&s;&s;|ings are indefinitely promi&s;ed to their children. That is, though it be not promi&s;ed that all the children of believers &s;hall have that grace conferred on them, which &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in their eternal &s;alva|tion, yet it is an article of the new covenant, that <Q>God will pour out his &s;pirit on the &s;eed of his covenanted people, and his ble&s;&s;ing on their offspring; by means of which, they &s;hall
<PB N="70" REF="017187_0069_0FA0720FCCAB9378">&s;pring up as the gra&s;s: And that he will circumci&s;e the heart of their &s;eed to fear and love the Lord.</Q> Many other pro|mi&s;es there are to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; which may &s;erve as a foun|dation of a &s;ure hope to them, that &s;ome, yea many of their chil|dren, &s;hall &s;hare with them in all the ble&s;&s;ings of the new cove|nant. The&s;e promi&s;es are made E&s;pecially and in a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing manner to the children of God's people; and they will have their full accompli&s;hment in the &s;alvation of many of them. If it had only been promi&s;ed, that God would pour out his &s;pirit upon &s;ome of the children of men, this would give no peculiar ground of hope, to a believer, re&s;pecting the &s;alvation of his chil|dren. For tho&s;e who are in and out of the church, are alike chil|dren of men. But the promi&s;e, being to them and their children, brings the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation home to their hou&s;e. God may extend his uncovenanted mercy to the heathen, and the families that call not on his name. But he has not engaged him&s;elf by a covenant promi&s;e to do this for them, as he has to vouch&s;afe this ble&s;&s;ing to the children of his own people. Accordingly, the apo&s;tle tells the jailor, that if he believed on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he &s;hould be &s;aved, and his hou&s;e; which implies, that &s;ome at lea&s;t, if not all his family, &s;hould &s;hare with him in this ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And &s;urely it ought to be accounted a great thing, to have the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant indefinitely promi&s;ed to our children, and have them pointed out as tho&s;e for whom, in particular, God de&s;igns his &s;pecial favour. And accordingly the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the church has ordinarily been continued in the families of God's people. <Q>They are the &s;eed of the ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, and their children after them.</Q> They have peculiar encourage|ment to pray for their children, and to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, in hopes that a &s;pecial ble&s;&s;|ing will follow their endeavours. And &s;uch children have &s;pe|cial encouragement to &s;eek the God of their fathers, <Q>who hath not &s;aid to the &s;eed of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain.</Q></P>
<P>Now, &s;uch is the effect of this gracious promi&s;e to the children of the covenant, that according to the ordinance and appointment of God, all &s;uch children are, in the account of the church, mem|bers of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body, and heirs of &s;alvation; and par|ticularly are to be admitted into the church by bapti&s;m, in like manner as adults are upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith. And though the grace of the new covenant promi&s;ed to the children of believers indefinitely, may not be &s;avingly applied to all of them, yet it is certain that &s;ome, yea many (no one knows how many) &s;hall be made the &s;ubjects of it. And as all of them have vi&s;ibly an equal intere&s;t in the covenant, it is the will of God that they all &s;hould, without di&s;tinction, enjoy the &s;ame privilege of church member|&s;hip; and that their being children of the covenant &s;hould be ta|ken as a &s;ufficient recommendation of them to the communion of
<PB N="71" REF="017187_0070_0FA07211621C5C60">the church, and be accounted as valid and &s;atisfactory an evidence of their being the people of God, as a profe&s;&s;ion of faith is on be|half of an adult. And if &s;uch children &s;hould die in infancy, their intere&s;t in the covenant is a good ground on which we be|lieve they will be eternally &s;aved. And while they live, they are, according to the go&s;pel rule, the &s;ubjects of church privileges and ordinances, as far and as &s;oon as they are capable of, and actually meet for them.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;criptural arguments in favour of infant church mem|ber&s;hip I &s;hall add another con&s;ideration, which &s;eems to me to have great weight.</P>
<P>The Jews certainly knew that their infants had an intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham, and had always been acknowledged, re|ceived, and recognized by circumci&s;ion, as being of the church and people of God. If the apo&s;tles had taught that infants were no longer to have an intere&s;t in God's covenant, or be members of the church, or receive any token of their being the people of God; the doctrine mu&s;t have been new, &s;trange, very &s;hocking, and offen&s;ive to the Jews. They mu&s;t certainly have taken no|tice of it, and been greatly di&s;plea&s;ed at it. They oppo&s;ed the a|po&s;tles with all their might, and did all in their power to render them odious, and &s;et the people again&s;t them and their new doc|trine. They were ready to take offence, and wanted neither wit nor will to lay hold of and exaggerate a plau&s;ible and popular objection. Such an objection they would have had, if the apo|&s;tles had denied that their children were to be church members any longer. They would not have borne &s;uch a doctrine, which declared all their children excommunicated and cut off from the kingdom and people of the Lord, and to have no part in him; but would certainly have urged the objection with a ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emence. And the apo&s;tles mu&s;t have &s;een, that it highly concerned them to an&s;wer the objection, and take up &s;o dangerous a &s;tumbling block, if their doctrine had given &s;o obvious and fair a handle to their e|nemies again&s;t them. But we have no hint in the New Te&s;ta|ment, or any author, Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Heathen, that ever I could find or learn, that the Jews ever made any &s;uch objection to the apo&s;tles, or their doctrine; or that the apo&s;tles ever attempt|ed either to obviate or &s;ilence it, or &s;aid one word about it: which is certainly a mo&s;t violent pre&s;umption, and may almo&s;t pa&s;s for plenary evidence, that the apo&s;tles did not, by denying the church member&s;hip of infants, furni&s;h an obvious occa&s;ion and ground for any &s;uch objection.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention but one argument more, grounded upon the Hi&s;tory of Infant Bapti&s;m, and the practice of the church from the apo&s;tolic age, according to the te&s;timony of the earlie&s;t writers. The fact, in &s;hort is found to &s;tand thus: 1. That the validity and lawfulne&s;s of infant bapti&s;m appears not to have ever been denied by any chri&s;tians till about the year 1130; and then only
<PB N="72" REF="017187_0071_0FA072120E9BB730">by one Peter de Bruis in France, with his followers, a &s;mall &s;ect, which held withal, that no infants were &s;aved, and divers other gro&s;s errors, as hi&s;torians report. It &s;oon dwindled to nothing. After which, there cannot be found a &s;ingle in&s;tance, well vouch|ed, of a per&s;on oppo&s;ing infant bapti&s;m (except &s;uch as denied water bapti&s;m) till the Anabapti&s;ts &s;prang up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Germany about 250 years ago. To this purpo&s;e we have the te&s;timony of Doctor Wall, a learned, diligent and faithful writer on the &s;ubject, in his Hi&s;tory of Infant Bapti&s;m. The&s;e are his words <Q>For the fir&s;t 400 years there appears only one man, Tertullian, that advi&s;ed the delay of infant bapti&s;m in &s;ome ca&s;es, and one Gre|gory that did perhaps practi&s;e &s;uch delay in the ca&s;e of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s chil|dren; but no &s;ociety &s;o thinking, or &s;o practi&s;ing; nor no one man &s;aying that it was unlawful to baptize infants. In the next 700 years, there is not &s;o much as one man to be found, that either &s;poke for, or practi&s;ed &s;uch delay, but all the con|trary. And when about the year 1130, one &s;ect among the Walden&s;es declared again&s;t the baptizing of infants, as being incapable of &s;alvation, the main body of that people rejected their opinion: and they of them that held that opinion, quick|ly dwindled away and di&s;appeared; there being no more heard of holding that tenet, till the ri&s;ing of the German A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tepedobap|ti&s;ts, in the year 1522.</Q> Thus far Dr. Wall. To this our opponents have hitherto found nothing to oppo&s;e, worthy of credit, except &s;ome te&s;timonies to the practice of baptizing adults; which are nothing to the purpo&s;e; &s;ince no one doubts that unbaptized a|dults, as well as infants, are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Or if any have been found &s;peaking again&s;t the bapti&s;m of infants, they have appeared to be &s;uch as were again&s;t all water bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the other hand, we have the expre&s;s te&s;timony of the learned Chri&s;tian writers, who lived within one, two, and three hundred years of the apo&s;tles, that infant bapti&s;m was not only then commonly practi&s;ed in the church, but had been received and practi&s;ed from the apo&s;tles; and that none were known of, among all the numerous &s;ects of Chri&s;tians, pretending to deny it.</P>
<P>The te&s;timonies of the fathers to this purpo&s;e, are commonly known by tho&s;e who are moderately ver&s;ed in this controver&s;y. Ju&s;tin Martyr, who wrote about 40 years after the apo&s;tles, men|tions expre&s;sly &s;ome aged Chri&s;tians, who were made di&s;ciples in, or from their infancy. And though he mentions not their infant bapti&s;m, his words fairly imply it. For if they were made di&s;ci|ples in infancy, they were doubtle&s;s the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Ire|naeus, who is &s;aid to have been born in the apo&s;tolic age, mentions the bapti&s;m of infants. He calls it, indeed, their regeneration;&mdash; but &s;o bapti&s;m was commonly termed by the ancient fathers, as all who are ver&s;ed in their writings know and acknowledge. Tertullian who lived within 100 years of the apo&s;tles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peaks of the bap|tizing of infants as a practice of the church; but advi&s;es to the
<PB N="73" REF="017187_0072_0FA07212E7D4F5E0">delay of it, except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; though he has nothing to &s;ay again&s;t the validity and lawfulne&s;s of it. He advi&s;es al&s;o the de|lay of bapti&s;m to adults, till they were married, or confirmed in continency. Though he was &s;ingular and whim&s;ical in his opi|nion, yet he may well be admitted as a credible witne&s;s that infant bapti&s;m was a common practice in the church at that time. And this is all the u&s;e we mean to make of any of the te&s;timonies we &s;hall produce.</P>
<P>Origen, who al&s;o lived within 100 years of the apo&s;tles, and who was one of the mo&s;t learned and knowing men of the age, de|clares, that infants are, by the u&s;age of the church, baptized for the forgivene&s;s of &s;in. And that an order for the baptizing in|fants, had been delivered to the church, from the apo&s;tles, who knew that the pollution of &s;in is in all
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A late writer, in defence of infant bapti&s;m, quoting this te&s;ti|mony of Origen, a&s;cribes it, by mi&s;take, to Irenaeus. Dr. Gill, ob&s;erving the mi&s;take, blu&s;ters at a &s;trange rate; charges the wri|ter with forgery; &s;ays there is no &s;uch pa&s;&s;age in Irenaeus; defies the whole literary world to produce or point out any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age in him, and exclaims, <Q>What a wretched cau&s;e mu&s;t infant bapti&s;m be, to require &s;uch management as this!</Q> Which de|claration of the Doctor has been quoted by a pamphlet writer a|mong our&s;elves (Mr. H.

<P>It is true, this writer was mi&s;taken in a&s;cribing this pa&s;&s;age to I|renaeus; and the Doctor had a right to correct this &s;lip of his me|mory.

<P>Cyprian, who lived but little more than 100 years after the apo&s;tles, gives as full a te&s;timony as po&s;&s;ible to the practice of in|fant bapti&s;m at the time he lived. At a council of 66 mini&s;ters, held about 150 years after the apo&s;tles, it was debated, whether it would not be proper to delay the baptizing of infants, till the eighth day, according to the law of circumci&s;ion. [Note, it ap|pears they con&s;idered bapti&s;m as coming in the room of circum|ci&s;ion.] They were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that there was no rea|&s;on for any &s;uch delay.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over divers other te&s;timonies as expre&s;s as can be de|&s;ired, I &s;hall only add that of Augu&s;tine, about 300 years after the
<PB N="74" REF="017187_0073_0FA072138E40C9D8">apo&s;tles; who declares that infant bapti&s;m had been every where con&s;tantly practi&s;ed in the church, ever &s;ince the apo&s;tles. And di&s;puting again&s;t Pelagius and his followers, who denied ori|ginal &s;in, he urges the bapti&s;m of infants as an argument, that they were &s;ubject to the guilt and defilement of it. And his antago|ni&s;ts, though hard pre&s;&s;ed with the argument, are &s;o far from calling the right of infant bapti&s;m in que&s;tion, that they acknow|ledge that they knew not, nor ever heard, that it was denied by any. A remarkable te&s;timony, as coming from per&s;ons of emi|neur learning and abilities, who had travelled over a great part of Chri&s;tendom, and &s;o had the be&s;t opportunity of getting the mo&s;t certain information, and would at once have got rid of a mo&s;t trouble&s;ome objection again&s;t their tenet, if they could have invalidated the authority of infant bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, that infant bapti&s;m has been received and practi&s;ed in the ancient church ever &s;ince the apo&s;tles is atte&s;t|ed by all antiquity, and denied by no one ancient writer. The fathers could not be ignorant what the practice of the church was in a ca&s;e &s;o notorious as this mu&s;t have been. If their truth may be relied upon, it is an undeniable fact, that infant bapti&s;m has obtained ever &s;ince the apo&s;tles, and was delivered by them to the church.&mdash;The great Calvin, therefore declares roundly, <Q>that they who &s;catter it abroad among the &s;imple vulgar, that infant bapti&s;m was for many years unknown in the church, he mo&s;t foully: (fae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;ime mentiontur) &s;ince the mo&s;t ancient writers re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts original to the times of the apo&s;tles
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it. lib. 4 Cap. 16 Sect. 8.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The exceptions of the contrary party have often been obviated. 1. "They object the fewne&s;s of the te&s;timonies" in favor of in|fant bapti&s;m in the early ages of the church: which is nothing &s;trange if their was a univer&s;al agreement in &s;entiment and prac|tice in this matter, as appears to have been the ca&s;e; and when it is con&s;idered, that but few of the writings of the ancient fathers are come down to us, and that &s;uch of them as we have are upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, as did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead them to &s;ay much of it. But if they &s;peak but &s;paringly for infant bapti&s;m, they &s;ay nothing again&s;t it, except Tertullian; who yet objects not to the lawfulne&s;s or valid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of it, and ever allows as expediency in &s;ome ca&s;es. 2. They &s;urmi&s;e, that &s;ome of the te&s;timo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es are not genuine; the credit of which have been &s;ufficiently vindicated. Be&s;ides this, they have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle or nothing to alledge, except arbitrary gue&s;&s;es, and &s;uppo&s;als, not worth repeating.</P>
<P>Now, as the practice of the church was doubtle&s;s uniform at fir&s;t in this point, and continued &s;o as long as the apo&s;tles lived; if infants were not baptized during the apo&s;tolic age (which con|tinue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">about 60 years after our Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt's a&s;cen&s;ion) it is incredi|ble that the church &s;hould &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o univer&s;ally depart from the rule and order, which had been delivered to; and un|ver&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y
<PB N="75" REF="017187_0074_0FA07214802F7088">received by them. But if any &s;uch &s;triking and notori|ous innovation as our opponents &s;uppo&s;e to have taken place, had been moved for; it is &s;urely beyond all belief, that it &s;hould be agreed to every where, and not one individual prote&s;t again&s;t it for more than 1100 years; in which time, there were &s;o many oppo&s;ite parties and factions among profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, who were endeavouring to ruin the credit of each other. He mu&s;t be ignorant of human nature; that can entertain &s;o extravagant a thought.</P>
<P>I will conclude this argument, and our whole plea, with one remark more. If infant bapti&s;m be a meer human invention, of no validity, as our opponents pretend, it is utterly incredible that Chri&s;t, "who has promi&s;ed to be with his church to the end of the world," &s;hould &s;uffer it to be &s;o long, and &s;o univer&s;ally re|ceived in the church; and that he &s;hould not in more than 1000 years rai&s;e up one witne&s;s, to bear te&s;timony again&s;t &s;o great a corruption of his ordinance, as renders it ab&s;olutely void, and of no effect. Can we &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t had no true church all this time; or that the bapti&s;m admini&s;tred in it was no divine ordi|nance? How incredible is it, and how di&s;honourable to Chri&s;t, the Head and King of the church, to &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;o neglected its intere&s;ts, as to permit a human invention to take the place of his holy ordinance, and that there &s;hould not be found one Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, nor &s;o much as one Chri&s;tian in the world, to witne&s;s a|gain&s;t &s;uch pre&s;umption? Can it po&s;&s;ibly be imagined, that a|mong &s;o many &s;aints, confe&s;&s;ors, and martyrs, who lived in all this time, not one &s;hould be found objecting to the lawfulne&s;s of infant bapti&s;m, if it was a mere nullity, as &s;ome would perfuade us. Surely Chri&s;t has never &s;uffered, nor will &s;uffer the gates of hell to prevail again&s;t his church, at this rate&mdash;And if we could &s;uppo&s;e that a human device had got into the church, in&s;tead of the true Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, no one knows when, or how; yet the German Anabapti&s;ts were the mo&s;t unlikely men in the world to be employed by Chri&s;t as the in&s;truments of reforming and re|&s;toring his neglected, or lo&s;t ordinances; men who&s;e opinions and practices were &s;o extravagant, as none will, at this day, attempt to vindicate; and who &s;eem to have been as manife&s;tly actuated by the devil, as any that we have ever had account of.</P>
<P>Let us now recapitulate what has been thus far di&s;cour&s;ed on this argument. It is granted that all tho&s;e who are members of the vi&s;ible church, are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. And it ap|pears that the infants of church members, are al&s;o of the church. For Chri&s;t has &s;aid, "That of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven," which is the church. And he has ble&s;&s;ed them with impo&s;ition of hands, which is a religious rite, and act of &s;acred communion, which has never been admini&s;tred to any but the vi&s;ible people of God. Chri&s;t has declared that they are to be received in his name, as be|longing to him, or of his church. They are expre&s;&s;ly called di&s;|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ples: and the apo&s;tles were authorized and in&s;tructed by ther

Paul &s;ays, that the children of believers are holy; but none are ever called holy, but &s;uch as are of right church members. They have an intere&s;t in the covenant with their parents. The covenant with Abraham was to him and his children in their generations. This was the new and everla&s;ting covenant, by which the church was formed at fir&s;t, and under which it has continued, though with a difference of external admini&s;tration, from the beginning to this day. It was not that old covenant which has been aboli&s;hed; but it was confirmed of God in Chri&s;t; who, as the mini&s;ter of the cir|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mci&s;ion, confirmed the promi&s;es made to the fathers. It con|tained the &s;ub&s;tance of the go&s;pel, which was in it preached unto Abraham. The ble&s;&s;ing of this covenant is come upon the Gen|tiles; who are the adopted children of Abraham, and his heirs according to the promi&s;e, entitled to the privileges of his cove|nant for them&s;elves and their children. They are ingrafted branches of the &s;ame olive, the church from which the unbeliev|ing Jews, the natural branches were broken off by unbelief: which could be no other than that church which had been form|ed by the Abrahamic covenant; which church, therefore, was not di&s;&s;olved; and which covenant was not di&s;anulled by the go&s;pel; nor are the children of God's covenanted people depriv|ed of their intere&s;t and &s;tanding therein. But the promi&s;e &s;till continues to them and their children, and to tho&s;e who are at pre&s;ent afar off, that is, to &s;o many of them as the Lord &s;hall call into his church; into the family of Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am, who is thus made the father of many nations; even of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of every nation who are added to the church. The&s;e therefore, having an inte|re&s;t in the covenant, are of the church. Bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parents and chil|dren, are accordingly the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, the initi|ating rite or token of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church, in&s;tead of circumci&s;ion, which had been enjoined and practi&s;ed under the former di&s;pen&s;ation. And it is a great confirmation of the church member&s;hip of infants under the go&s;pel, that the Jews never ob|jected to the chri&s;tians, that their doctrine deprived their chil|dren of the privilege of being in the covenant and church of God; nor did the apo&s;tles, or any of the chri&s;tians, ever attempt to an&s;wer any &s;uch objection. Be&s;ides, it is atte&s;ted by the ancient fathers, who lived &s;oon after the apo&s;tles, that infant bapti&s;m had been received and practi&s;ed in the church all along as an apo&s;tolic in&s;titution; and it does not appear that the lawfulne&s;s of it was called in que&s;tion by any one for more than 1000 years. All the&s;e things being con&s;idered, the evidence of the divine right of infant bapti&s;m is, I think, clear and full, and &s;ufficient to put the matter beyond all rational doubt.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to con&s;ider the objections,</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t is, <Q>that there is no command in &s;cripture for baptizing infants, nor can it be proved, that the apo&s;tles bap|tized any &s;uch. We have expre&s;s accounts of the bapti&s;m of men and women; but that infants were, or ought to be admit|ted as &s;ubjects of this ordinance, the &s;cripture &s;aith not. How can this be a divine ordinance, when there is neither precept nor precedent for it?</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, If it any way appears from the &s;cripture, that infants are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, it matters not whether this doctrine be grounded on an expre&s;s precept or example, or whether it be taught in &s;ome other way. Is it not pre&s;umption for us to &s;ay, that we will not believe this to be the mind of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he has revealed it in the particular way that we may pitch upon? The que&s;tion &s;hould be, whether we can find, or gather from the &s;criptures any Sufficient evidence, that infants are to be baptized. If the rea&s;ons on which our doctrine and practice is grounded, be good and conclu&s;ive, we ought to acquie&s;ce in them. It never can be proved, either by &s;cripture or rea&s;on, that con&s;equential evi|dence is in&s;ufficient to determine our judgment, and practice, in matters of religion; or that every part of God's revealed will is delivered in expre&s;s propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Since the &s;criptures plainly acknowledge and a&s;&s;ert the mem|ber&s;hip of infants in the go&s;pel church, that they are of the number of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, that they are holy, and have an in|tere&s;t in God's gracious covenant; and &s;ince it is owned by all, that, according to the order and rule of the go&s;pel, all tho&s;e who are vi&s;ibly of the church, di&s;ciples, holy, and in the covenant, are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m: the con&s;equence is clear, that in|fants are to be baptized. And this is equivalent to an expre&s;s or|der herefor. It is as plain and valid a warrant, though it be con|&s;equential, as an expre&s;s order would be.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o &s;uch precedents in favour of our practice, as, though they may be cavilled at, mu&s;t, I think, be of great weight with every unbia&s;&s;ed man; precedents which &s;eem to render it morally certain, that infant bapti&s;m was practi&s;ed by the apo&s;|tles. Three whole families we read of, who were baptized. If there were any children under the age of di&s;cretion, in any of the&s;e families, they were certainly admitted. Now, though it be not &s;aid whether there were any &s;uch children, yet it can &s;carce be doubted that there were, when the following circum&s;tances are well con&s;idered. 1. If we &s;hould take three families among us, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, I &s;uppo&s;e the probability would be, at lea&s;t, fifty to one, that there would be young children in &s;ome of them. 2. It is not &s;aid, or intimated, that there were no &s;uch children in the&s;e families. But if it had been the ca&s;e that there were no chil|dren in the&s;e hou&s;es, and if children ought not to be baptized,
<PB N="78" REF="017187_0077_0FA072168BA67BA0">there was great rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity that &s;o important and un|common a circum&s;tance &s;hould be mentioned, to prevent a dangerous mi&s;take, which the&s;e accounts, left as they &s;tand, would naturally lead men into. For the bapti&s;m of the&s;e families would naturally be con&s;idered as precedents for baptizing other fami|lies, in which there were infants. And as the con&s;tant and known practice of the church for thou&s;ands of years, and the declarations of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, were in favour of infant church mem|ber&s;hip; how rea&s;onable mu&s;t it needs appear to practi&s;e hou&s;|hold bapti&s;m, unle&s;s it were plainly te&s;tified and guarded again&s;t? In &s;hort, we have expre&s;s precedents, or examples, if not of infant bapti&s;m, yet of hou&s;hold bapti&s;m, infants not excepted; and that too upon the faith or profe&s;&s;ion of the head of the family. For it is to be carefully noted, that in the&s;e accounts it is not &s;aid, or intimated, that all in the&s;e families were baptized on a per&s;on|al profe&s;&s;ion of faith; but only, that the head of the family be|lieved, and thereupon was baptized with all the hou&s;e. And up|on the authority of the&s;e precedents of family bapti&s;m, in con|junction with the other grounds which have been mentioned, we a&s;&s;ert and claim the right of hou&s;hold bapti&s;m, on behalf of the families of believers, infants not excepted. And we challenge tho&s;e who will not admit them, to produce an authentic order or precedent for this their refu&s;al.</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel, though it has changed the initiating &s;acrament, continues infants in the &s;ame &s;tanding in the church, which it was well known they had had all along; it is nothing &s;trange that we have not more expre&s;s orders and precedents touching infant bapti&s;m. What need of new precepts and examples, to a&s;certain a point, which had in effect been long &s;ince &s;ettled; which all un|der&s;tood, and all agreed in. But how infinitely &s;trange would it be, if infants, who had from the beginning been of the church, by the appointment of God, and the &s;ubjects of the initiating ordi|nance, &s;hould be ca&s;t out of the church, and cut off from the peo|ple of God, without any order or precedent for it in &s;cripture? And yet this we mu&s;t believe, if we deny their church member|&s;hip and bapti&s;m. For certainly their is neither order or prece|dent for excluding them from the church, or from the initiating rite.</P>
<P>If the apo&s;tles had refu&s;ed to admit infants into the go&s;pel church by bapti&s;m, we &s;hould, without all peradventure, have had a plain order not to receive them. The ca&s;e was &s;uch as mu&s;t, in all rea&s;on, have required it. Such a great and import|ant change in the con&s;titution of the church, as would cut off a great part of tho&s;e who had always been acknowledged to be in the church and covenant of God, mu&s;t have &s;eemed &s;trange to the Jewi&s;h converts; who would naturally have expected that their children were &s;till to be received with them, as heretofore; and would, accordingly, have moved to have them baptized; as the ancient Jewi&s;h writers atte&s;t was commonly practi&s;ed at the ad|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="79" REF="017187_0078_0FA072174C400068">of pro&s;elytes. At lea&s;t, they would have enquired, whe|ther the go&s;pel church admitted infants as well as adult believ|ers; which mu&s;t have given occa&s;ion for a plain and expre&s;s de|termination of the point, if &s;o great and &s;triking an innovation was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And it would be of great nece&s;&s;ity that &s;uch a decree &s;hould be promulgated and recorded, as a &s;tanding rule or canon, to be ob&s;erved by all the churches. But nothing like this appears in any writings, &s;acred or profane. We may therefore retort the argument upon our adver&s;aries thus: Since infants had always been received as church members, by the ini|tiating rite, they who refu&s;e &s;till to receive them, ought to be a|ble to produce plain orders or precedents for this their refu&s;al: which &s;ince they cannot do, we conclude that the right of church member&s;hip &s;till belongs to them, and that they are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>There was not that occa&s;ion for an expre&s;s mention of the bap|ti&s;m of infants, as of women: for as women had hitherto been admitted to the privileges of church member&s;hip, without being circumci&s;ed, it might well be doubted, whether bapti&s;m, the &s;a|crament of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church, was to be admi|ni&s;tred to females. To remove this &s;cruple, we have expre&s;s pre|cedents of female bapti&s;m; &s;hewing that per&s;ons of either &s;ex are alike proper &s;ubjects of this ordinance. But there was no room to doubt, whether the token of church member&s;hip were to be applied to infants; nor had it ever been called in que&s;tion&mdash;And yet the New Te&s;tament furni&s;hes clear proofs that they are mem|bers of the go&s;pel church; and expre&s;s precedents of hou&s;hold bapti&s;m, without exception of infants; as has been &s;hewn; nor is there any thing of weight to be urged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>If, after all that has been &s;aid, the want of more expre&s;s orders or precedents for infant bapti&s;m &s;tick as a &s;cruple in the minds of any, let the following con&s;iderations be added to what has been &s;aid. 1. Is it not as &s;trange, and more &s;o, that we have but one expre&s;s example of infant circumci&s;ion, in all the Old Te&s;tament, and not one among the I&s;raelites? And yet no doubt, it was practi&s;ed every day. Is it not &s;trange, that there is neither ex|pre&s;s precept nor example, in the New Te&s;tament, of women's coming to the Lord's &s;upper? And yet no doubt, they did &s;o commonly. Je&s;us, it &s;eems, baptized more di&s;ciples than John. John iv. 1. Is it not &s;trange, that none of the writers of the New Te&s;tament, except John, give the lea&s;t hint that he baptized at all, though John's baptizing is often mentioned by almo&s;t all of them? The&s;e in&s;tances may &s;hew, how little &s;uch a negative argument is to be depended on in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. 2. Is it not a manife&s;t &s;ign of prejudice, and an unfair mind, to think there is no &s;uffici|ent warrant for infant bapti&s;m, unle&s;s there be expre&s;s orders or precedents for it; and yet refu&s;e to receive infants as of the church, though there be neither precept nor precedent to war|rant or ju&s;tify our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e u&s;ing them that privilege, with which they
<PB N="80" REF="017187_0079_0FA072180BD071D0">were inve&s;ted by God, and held it without di&s;pute thou&s;ands of years? Is not this to &s;train at a gnat, and &s;wallow a camel? 3. Does it become us to di&s;regard, and refu&s;e to admit &s;uch evidence as mu&s;t be acknowledged to be of weight, and &s;tand cavilling, that the ca&s;e might have been made plainer? I grant it might, if God had plea&s;ed. And &s;o might many other truths, which yet we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe. Our opponents mu&s;t own, that if infant bapti&s;m be contrary to the mind of Chri&s;t, this would have been much plainer, had there been an expre&s;s order again&s;t it; and much di&s;pute and trouble would have been pre|vented. The ca&s;e is left ju&s;t as plain as Chri&s;t has thought fit it &s;hould be. And it belongs not to us to object, that the evidence is not &s;uch as we &s;hould like be&s;t; but to enquire &s;eriou&s;ly, humbly, and prayerfully, what is truth; and thankfully to clo&s;e with it, upon any good evidence of it that we can find. 4. Let me a&s;k the objector, What he would have? What proof would &s;atisfy him? Would it give &s;atisfaction, if the order had run thus: <Q>Go teach all nations, baptizing them, and their children?</Q> You could as ea&s;ily and fairly evade this, as you do the expre&s;s proofs we bring of infant church member&s;hip. Chri&s;t &s;ays expre&s;sly, that the kingdom of heaven is, or con&s;i&s;ts of little children; and it is not denied, that the kingdom of heaven is the church; yet we are told, that the&s;e little children, which are of the church, are not infants, but adults, re&s;embling little children in humility. The apo&s;tle &s;ays expre&s;sly, that the children of believers are Ho|ly. A character never once given in &s;cripture to any but church members: yet this avails nothing. A new &s;en&s;e, unknown in the &s;criptures, is invented, and put upon the word, though it makes non&s;en&s;e of the text. We bring expre&s;s &s;cripture to prove, that the promi&s;e is to the children, as well as the parents; that be|lievers are accounted the children and heirs of Abraham, accord|ing to the promi&s;e; and that his ble&s;&s;ing is come upon the Gen|tiles: And the right of church member&s;hip for his natural po&s;te|rity, was certainly one article of this ble&s;&s;ing. Yet our opponents go on "wriggling and wrangling," again&s;t all this evidence, up|on no better foundation than their own arbitrary conjectures and hypothe&s;is. While men are in this humour, what confidence can we have, that, if there had been an expre&s;s order for infant bap|ti&s;m, they would not &s;et their inventions to work to explain it away? And we might be told, that the children to be baptized are &s;uch as are capable of profe&s;&s;ing faith; or that they are &s;uch as re&s;emble infants in humility; or that they are &s;piritual children, who imitate the faith of the fir&s;t converts; or that they are to be baptized after they have been fir&s;t taught, and have given evi|dence of their effectual calling, &amp;c. In &s;hort, a fair and hone&s;t mind will embrace the truth upon any &s;ufficient proof, whether direct or con&s;equential. But when the integrity of the mind is corrupted and di&s;torted, by prejudices, and fondne&s;s for particu|lar &s;chemes, the light that is in men becomes darkne&s;s; and ways
<PB N="81" REF="017187_0080_0FA0721976605190">will be found to ward off conviction, for the mo&s;t part, by any ar|guments whatever. I have con&s;idered this objection the more largely, becau&s;e, though it has really no weight in it, yet it is apt enough to amu&s;e and puzzle weak and &s;imple minds, and to breed &s;cruples, which &s;ometimes prove very trouble&s;ome and hurtful.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome, <Q>that it is not being in the covenant or church that gives a right to bapti&s;m; but a divine order to that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e is this &s;aid, except to rai&s;e a du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and keep up a fruitle&s;s altercation? You acknowledge that it is according to the order and rule of the go&s;pel, that all tho&s;e be received as the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, who have vi&s;ibly an intere&s;t in the cove|nant, and appear to be &s;uch as are to be received into the go&s;pel church. Whether, therefore, their being vi&s;ibly in covenant and of the church gives them the right to bapti&s;m or not; yet, by your own acknowledgment it proves, or evidences an unque&s;tiona|ble right thereto. The allegation in the objection is, indeed, mo&s;t unrea&s;onable: but if we &s;hould admit it, for argument &s;ake; the church member&s;hip of infants being proved, their right to bap|ti&s;m is undeniable, as long as it is allowed that all church mem|bers are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Another principal objection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; that <Q>according to the go&s;pel order, faith and repentance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on at lea&s;t a credible profe&s;&s;ion thereof, are required of all previou&s;ly or in order to their being baptized. The apo&s;tiles were fir&s;t to teach tho&s;e whom they baptized. Mat. xxviii. 19. Chri&s;t puts believing before bap|ti&s;m, when he &s;ays,</Q> <Q>He that believeth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mark xvi. 16: And Peter &s;ays to the Jews, who being pricked in their hearts, a&s;ked, what they &s;hould do;</Q> <Q>Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be baptized.</Q> Acts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>An&s;wer. To &s;hew that this objection is without any weight, we need only open our bibles, and read the &s;everal texts that are brought to &s;upport it. Let us take them in their order.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, Mat. xxviii. 19. I have before ob&s;erved, that the proper &s;ignification of the Greek is, <Q>Go make all nations di&s;ci|ples, (or pro&s;elytes) baptizing them&mdash;teaching them, &amp;c.</Q> as our opponents grant: And that this is a good warrant for the bapti&s;m of the infants, who according to the &s;criptures, and the con&s;tant &s;en&s;e and practi&s;e of the Jews, in the admi&s;&s;ion of pro|&s;elytes, are to be accounted di&s;ciples or pro&s;elytes, as well as the parents; and are therefore to be admitted by the &s;ame outward rite. And to &s;ay that infants can no otherwi&s;e become di&s;ciples
<PB N="82" REF="017187_0081_0FA072198C7C3678">than by being taught, is no better than a mean begging of the very point to be proved. Whenever the apo&s;tles made a di&s;ciple of the parent, the right and privilege of di&s;ciples was given to the children; who were as &s;uch to be baptized, together with the parents, according to the apo&s;tles orders, to di&s;ciple and bap|tize all nations.</P>
<P>And if we &s;hould under&s;tand the word here u&s;ed as &s;ignifying to in&s;truct or indoctrinate, there would be no rea&s;on for any one to conclude, that infants may not be baptized till they are fir&s;t taught&mdash;No &s;uch thing is &s;aid, or in the lea&s;t implied. Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples are indeed to be taught, as well as baptized; children as well as adults; as far, and as &s;oon as they are capable of it. But that they may not be baptized till after they have been fir&s;t taught, there is not one word, nor i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta in the whole paragraph. And to argue from the bare order of the words, that indoctrina|tion is a nece&s;&s;ary prerequi&s;ite to bapti&s;m, in all ca&s;es, is to build up|on quick&s;and indeed. For it is well known, that things are often mentioned in &s;cripture, in a promi&s;cuous or inverted order.&mdash;Nay, if the order of the words were any &s;olid foundation to argue upon, we might, in this way, prove that it was the will of Chri&s;t, that the apo&s;tles &s;hould make di&s;ciples, by fir&s;t baptizing them, and then teaching them. For the in&s;tructions Chri&s;t gave them when he &s;ent them forth, &s;tand in this order; <Q>Go di&s;ciple all nations, baptizing them&mdash;teaching them,</Q> &amp;c. But we lay no &s;tre&s;s at all upon &s;uch pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carious arguments. The truth is, &s;ome are to be taught before, and in order to their being baptized. Others are by bapti&s;m to be introduced into the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, and put under the di&s;cipline of the church before, and in order to their being taught. Adults we grant, are to be fir&s;t taught, and to make a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, in order to their being baptized; and that for two rea&s;ons. 1. They are immediately capable of it. 2. They have no vi&s;ible right or meetne&s;s to be received as mem|bers of the church of Chri&s;t, till they profe&s;s their faith in him. And we may add, that it is not the will of Chri&s;t that any &s;uch &s;hould be taken into his &s;chool, without their free con&s;ent. On the contrary, there are two rea&s;ons why the infants of believers &s;hould be bapti&s;m be received into the church, without their be|ing fir&s;t taught, and profe&s;&s;ing their faith. 1. They are not at pre&s;ent capable of it. 2. Their church member&s;hip and right to bapti&s;m is manife&s;t without it from the &s;criptures; as has been &s;hewn. And it is the will of Chri&s;t, that they be entered into his &s;chool immediately, previous to their actual con&s;ent. A pro|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, does not more evidence the right of a believer to bapti&s;m, than his infant child's right to the &s;ame is evidenced by the &s;criptures, which declare that, <Q>of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven, that the promi&s;e is to them, and that they are holy.</Q></P>
<P>This text then contains nothing again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, and I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn, that it furni&s;hes a good argument in fa|vour of it. The next pa&s;&s;age we have to con&s;ider is, Mark xvi.
<PB N="83" REF="017187_0082_0FA0721A4CAD6450">15, 16. <Q>Preach the go&s;pel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</Q> If this text does not contain &s;o much in favour of infant bapti&s;m as the other, yet certainly there is nothing again&s;t it. It is true, faith and bapti&s;m are here required in order to &s;alvation. But whether in order to &s;alvation, faith be required before bapti&s;m in all ca&s;es, or in any ca&s;e, is not &s;aid; nor can it be proved from this text; which only contains a promi&s;e of &s;al|vation to tho&s;e who believe and are baptized. And I pre&s;ume it will be allowed, that if any one &s;hould fir&s;t be baptized, and af|terwards &s;hould believe; this promi&s;e would belong to him, as really as if he had fir&s;t believed, and then was baptized.&mdash;If any one &s;hould be baptized upon a hypocritical profe&s;&s;ion of faith, and afterwards &s;hould become a true believer, he would no doubt be &s;aved; nor would it be required of him that he be again baptized. And though we grant that a profe&s;&s;ion of faith is required of an unbaptized adult, in order to his being baptized; yet it is an abu&s;e of &s;cripture, to argue that infants are not to be baptized till they believe, becau&s;e believing is mentioned before bapti&s;m in this place, which by the acknowledgment of our opponents, "Speaks only of tho&s;e who are capable of attending to the preaching of the go&s;pel, and of actual believing." They do not apply to infants the damnatory &s;entence again&s;t unbelievers; and it is equally un|rea&s;onable, to urge their want of faith, as an objection to their be|ing admitted to bapti&s;m.&mdash;In &s;hort, I can find nothing in the&s;e words, that makes the lea&s;t difficulty in the matter; unle&s;s we will be &s;o ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd as to imagiue, that infants and adult believers cannot both be the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m; or that the mention of the one alone, implies the denial of the other.</P>
<P>In Acts ii. 38. Peter exhorts his hearers to repent and be bap|tized for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Tho&s;e whom he thus exhorts were all adults. For no one preaches to young infants. We grant that repentance is required of unbaptized adults, in order to their being baptized. But does he &s;o much as hint, that infants are not to be admitted. No. But in the next words a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;ame promi&s;e which belonged to them, and which he holds up as a warrant and encouragement to them, to repent and be baptiz|ed, did al&s;o belong to their children. But the&s;e words have been before con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark is to be made on the words of Philip to the Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch, <Q>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t be baptized.</Q> Any Fedobapti&s;t, mu&s;t, upon his own principles, have &s;aid the &s;ame, upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The examples of tho&s;e who were baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, are &s;ometimes brought as an objection again&s;t infant bap|ti&s;m. The&s;e, we grant, are a proof that believers are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. We grant further, that they are no proof that in|&s;ants are &s;ubjects. But it is &s;trange it &s;hould ever be thought that the&s;e examples make any thing again&s;t the bapti&s;m of infants.
<PB N="84" REF="017187_0083_0FA0721B0B981BF0">Cannot adult believers be admitted, unle&s;s infants berejected? Is there not room enough in the church for both? A thou&s;and in|&s;tances of one &s;ort, are no argument again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of the other. The truth is, we have not many certain in&s;tances of adult bapti&s;m mentioned particularly in the New Te&s;tament. Several of the&s;e were per&s;ons of note, who had no children. Of others, it appears, that if there were children in their families, as is high|ly probable, they were baptized with them. And &s;ome that are confidently &s;uppo&s;ed to have been adults, might a great part of them have been infants, for any thing that appears to the contra|ry; particularly the 3000 added to the church on the day of Pen|teco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. But among all tho&s;e, who are &s;aid to have been baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, it is remarkable that we find not one that was both of Chri&s;tian parents, or was, on our principles, a fit &s;ubject of bapti&s;m in infancy. We have in the New Te&s;tament the hi&s;tory of the church for thirty years after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, in all which there is not one in&s;tance that in the lea&s;t countenances their practice, who are again&s;t the bapti&s;m of the children of be|lievers, till they are of age to profe&s;s their faith. Wherein they differ from us, they have mo&s;t certainly neither precept nor ex|ample in &s;cripture to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this objection, which has often been held up with &s;o much parade, is like a vapour; which, beheld at a di&s;|tance, may look as if there might be &s;omething in it; but upon a nearer view, is found to be as light and un&s;ul &s;tantial as the air, while we endeavour to handle it, we can find nothing in it.</P>
<P>It is objected by &s;ome, that <Q>Chri&s;t was baptized in adult age; and we ought herein to follow his example.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. John's bapti&s;m, with which Chri&s;t was baptized, was not in&s;tituted till Chri&s;t was of adult age. How could it be expect|ed that he &s;hould have the ordinance admini&s;tred to him, before it was a divine ordinance? We might as well argue again&s;t infant circumci&s;ion, becau&s;e Abraham was circumci&s;ed in adult age. But Chri&s;t in his infancy was dedicated to God, and received into the number of his people, according to the ordinances then in u&s;e: which thay &s;erve as a precedent and pattern to chri&s;tians to dedicate their children to God in bapti&s;m, the rite of inducti|on to the chri&s;tian church. Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was the token of his &s;olemn con&s;ecration, to his public mini&s;try; &s;ignifying his ano inting with the Holy Gho&s;t to the offices of prophet, prie&s;t, and king, which he was to execute, and was accordingly mau|gurated at his entering on the public di&s;charge of the&s;e his offices, when he was about thirty years of age. There were many pe|culiar circum&s;tances attending Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, which are not imitable by us.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fant bapti&s;m is a part of popery, the ba&s;is of national churches, and worldly-e&s;tabli&s;hments; that it unites the church and world, and keep them together.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="017187_0084_0FA0721C778977E0">
An&s;wer. Infant bapti&s;m is grounded on the &s;criptures; and is commonly practi&s;ed in tho&s;e churches that are not, nor ever were &s;ubject to the Pope; therefore, it is not a part of Popery, though practi&s;ed, as divers other ordinances are, in the Roman church.</P>
<P>Infant bapti&s;m is not the ba&s;it of national churches, and world|ly e&s;tabli&s;hments. Infants were church members long before there was a national church in the world; which was not till the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reb covenant. That particular con&s;titution of a church, and form of admini&s;tration, whereby it becomes national, has no connection with, or dependance upon infant bapti&s;m. A national church may as well be formed upon the principle of Antepedobapti&s;m as any other. If the church of England &s;hould renounce infant bap|ti&s;m, and yet retain its pre&s;ent con&s;titution in other re&s;pects, it would &s;till be, and might as well continue, a national church as ever. There may be a national church, though not one half of the nation are of it. And there would be no national church, though all the individuals of the nation were members of congregational churches. And as for worldly e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion, it is too plain to need in&s;i&s;ting on, that infant bapti&s;m no way affects them. Infant bapti&s;m &s;tands as well without, as with human e&s;tabli&s;h|ments; and human e&s;tabli&s;hments can &s;tand as well without, as with infant bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Infant bapti&s;m does not unite the church and the world, and keep them together. If by the world we mean tho&s;e that are not of the vi&s;ible church; how can the baptizing of &s;uch infants as are of the church, unite the church with tho&s;e that do not be|long to it? If by the world be meant profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, who are manife&s;tly unmeet and unworthy of chri&s;tian communion, infant bapti&s;m neither unites the church, nor keeps it united with any &s;uch. It is owing to the neglect or abu&s;e of di&s;cipline, when &s;uch remain united with the church. Or if any &s;hould mean by the world, vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians, who are &s;ecretly hypocritical; it is not the will of Chri&s;t that the church &s;hould be &s;eparated from the&s;e, till their hypocri&s;y becomes manife&s;t. Nor would the abo|li&s;hing of infant bapti&s;m make &s;uch a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience is requir|ed in bapti&s;m, in order to its being of &s;aving advantage, 1 Pet. iii. 21. And as infants are incapable of this, they are not &s;ub|jects of bapti&s;m.</Q> I an&s;wer, Though the an&s;wer or engage|ment of a good con&s;cience mu&s;t be joined with the outward wa&s;hing with water, when the &s;ubject is capable of it, yet this makes nothing again&s;t infant bapti&s;m. For if the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience be afterwards annexed to the &s;acramental wa&s;hing re|ceived in infancy, &s;uch a bapti&s;m is as valid, and as available to &s;alvation, as if the wa&s;hing with water, and the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience, had been at the &s;ame time. And infants are by their bapti&s;m, bound to the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience; which they are to recognize and perform, when they are capable of it. In|deed,
<PB N="86" REF="017187_0085_0FA0721C8CCABC08">this pa&s;&s;age &s;peaks plainly in our favour. For the apo&s;tle compares bapti&s;m to the ark of Noah, as being the figure or an|titype of it, bearing a re&s;emblance to it. Noah by faith, prepar|ed the ark, for the &s;aving of him&s;elf and his hou&s;e. As his chil|dren were received with him into the ark; &s;o the children of be|lievers belong to the church, and are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, to|gether with their parents; which bears in this re&s;pect, the figure and re&s;emblance of the ark</P>
<P>It is al&s;o objected, that <Q>if infants are members of the church, and &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, they ought al&s;o to be admitted to par|take of the Lord's &s;upper, which is an ordinance to which all the members of the Chri&s;tian church have a right. And ac|cordingly it was cu&s;tomary with the ancient Chri&s;tians, who practi&s;ed infant bapti&s;m, to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper al&s;o to them. And they who di&s;approve the communicating of in|fants, &s;hould, if they would be con&s;i&s;tent, di&s;allow the bap|tizing of them.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. We grant that infants, as church members, have an external right to all the ordinances of the vi&s;ible church, as far, and &s;oon as they are actually capable of, and meet for them. As they are immediately capable and meet &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, they are to be admitted thereto without delay. As &s;oon as they are capable of receiving in&s;truction from the word, they &s;hould be brought to give their attendance to it; and when they can &s;o far under&s;tand the nature and de&s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper, and have &s;uch a mea&s;ure of knowledge and faith, that they can di&s;cern the Lord's body, and examine them&s;elves, and &s;o eat of that bread, and drink of that cup; it is not only their right, but their duty to do &s;o, without delay. Though an infant may have a right to an e&s;tate, of which he is an heir, yet he is not admitted to po&s;&s;e&s;s, oc|cupy, and improve it, till he is of capacity for it. And &s;uch is the nature and de&s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper, that a right attend|ance on it, requires an actual capacity and pre&s;ent meetne&s;s for it; which infants have not. And it is this want of capacity and meetne&s;s, and not a want of right to church privileges, that is the rea&s;on why we do not admit them. But this rea&s;on does not ex|clude them from bapti&s;m; of which they are as capable and &s;treet &s;ubjects now, as they were of circumci&s;ion formerly. They are capable of the &s;ign, and the thing &s;ignified; of coming under the obligations, and having the grace and privileges of the covenant &s;ecured and conveyed to them; of being &s;olemnly dedicated to God; recognized and admitted, as his vi&s;ible church and people. The&s;e things they are capable of in infancy. And to &s;ignify and effect the&s;e, is the de&s;ign and u&s;e of bapti&s;m, as has been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>We acknowledge it was an error in the ancient Chri&s;tians, to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper to infants. They might, probably, beled into it, by con&s;idering that the Jewi&s;h infants did eat of the pa&s;&s;over; which, they might &s;uppo&s;e, an&s;wered to the Lord's &s;up|per;
<PB N="87" REF="017187_0086_0FA0721D5DF5C8D8">&amp; by mi&s;taking what Chri&s;t &s;aid of the nece&s;&s;ity of eating his fle&s;h, and drinking his blood. The rea&s;on was plau&s;ible, though inconclu&s;ive. And they were, upon further con&s;ideration, con|vinced of their mi&s;take; and laid this practice wholly a&s;ide. But we do not find that the divine right of infant bapti&s;m was ever called in que&s;tion by them, or the practice of it di&s;continued. Their admitting infants to the Lord's &s;upper, though irregular, was yet a le&s;s and more excu&s;eable error, than it is to &s;hut them wholly out of the church. Though a young infant may not be fit to fit at the table, and eat the meat of &s;trong men; yet this would not, by any means, be &s;o improper, as to turn him out of doors, and not own him as belonging to the family.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered all the chief objections again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, that I have met with; which I have aimed to &s;tate fairly and candidly, though briefly&mdash;I can find no weight in them. But if, after all, it &s;hould &s;eem to any, that there is &s;ome real difficul|ty in the ca&s;e, that they know not how to remove; this ought not to overthrow or &s;tagger their belief of the doctrine it&s;elf, if the arguments in favour of it are &s;ound to be conclu&s;ive, or of more weight than the contrary objections. Yea, if any &s;hould think there is only a greater probability for, than again&s;t it, they ought to be determined in their judgment and practice, by proba|ble evidence, till they can obtain &s;uch proofs as are more full and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>I intended to have added &s;ome reflections upon the whole ar|gument. But here I mu&s;t aim to be as brief as po&s;&s;ible; as this di&s;cour&s;e is already much longer than was intended.</P>
<P>It appears, I tru&s;t, that our opponents have no rea&s;on to &s;ay, as they are wont to do with great confidence, that there is no|thing in the &s;criptures in favour of infant bapti&s;m, but they plain|ly declare again&s;t it. We have &s;earched the &s;criptures, and find nothing at all contrary to infant bapti&s;m; and plain proofs that infants are members of the go&s;pel church, and that all church members are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Whether this does not amount to a fair and full proof, let every one who has the rea&s;on of a man con&s;ider and judge.</P>
<P>We learn al&s;o, the error of rebaptizing tho&s;e, who have been baptized in their infancy. This practice cannot be ju&s;tified either by precept or example, or any good rea&s;ons. Infant bapti&s;m ad|mini&s;tred by &s;prinkling, we have examined by the &s;criptures, and find it to be well warranted. To renounce it therefore, and be baptized over again, is utterly wrong. And though we chari|tably believe that tho&s;e who have gone into this practice, have done it con&s;cientiou&s;ly, yet their con&s;ciences were therein mi&s;guided, and they have entangled them&s;elves by the wrong &s;tep they have taken, and given &s;atan an advantage again&s;t them. Having openly renounc|ed communion with all chri&s;tians, but tho&s;e of their own party, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo often appear to be exceedingly hardened again&s;t all means that
<PB N="88" REF="017187_0087_0FA0721E0C7CB378">can be u&s;ed for convincing them of their error; and take it with great &s;corn and impatience, to have it &s;ugge&s;ted to them that per|haps they are in a mi&s;take. And if any &s;uch &s;u&s;picions &s;hould ever ari&s;e in their minds, yet what a &s;trong temptation will they have to wink hard again&s;t the light, when it begins to enter into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> minds, and to di&s;cover to them, what they cannot bear the thoughts of, that in the height of their confidence they have been wrong. It is very unhappy when chri&s;tians run them&s;elves into &s;uch &s;ad intanglements, and yet their &s;cruples and prejudices fixed and riveted.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch then as labour under doubts and &s;cruples, re&s;pecting the validity of the bapti&s;m they have received in their infancy, be advi&s;ed not to be ha&s;ty and ra&s;h, in taking a &s;tep of &s;o much importance, as the renouncing of this their bapti&s;mal dedication to God, and the communion of tho&s;e churches, which have had evident tokens of the gracious pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in their admini|&s;trations. We are far from urging you to give up your con&s;ci|ences to our direction. We claim no dominion over the faith of any one, but wi&s;h you to examine and judge for your&s;elves, what is truth, and what is right.

Nor do we object to your con&s;idering candidly what may be offered on the other fide: for we are per&s;uaded that a good cau&s;e will &s;uffer no damage by being thoroughly examined in the cleare&s;t light. But remem|ber there is a great difference between a difficulty and a clear rea|&s;on, between being puzzled, and having a rational and &s;atisfac|tory conviction; between having &s;cruples about the regularity of infant bapti&s;m, and having &s;ufficient arguments again&s;t it. Take time to weigh things fairly and ju&s;tly; and let no one drive you along blindly, fa&s;ter than you can &s;ee your way plain before you.

If they &s;hould live to grow up under your care, train them up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the nurture and admonition of the Lord, hoping and expecting a &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ing on the&s;e &s;abours of love. Con&s;ider that the&s;e children are of the church of Chri&s;t. He has put them under your care to be brought up for him. Let your belief of this animate your hopes, your prayers, and endeavours for them. They who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;believe and deny this article of our faith out them&s;elves off from the&s;e comfortable and encouraging views, with re&s;pect to their children. And how far their neglect of dedicating them to God in his appointed ordinance may expo&s;e &s;uch families to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckens of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered. And yet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hope, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of them who are the true people of God, that the promi&s;e is to their children as well as ours
<PB N="90" REF="017187_0089_0FA0721F8E81A750">though they do not believe it, or take the comfort, or make the improvement of it, which they ought. We willingly hope and tru&s;t, that their unbelief in this point, will not make the faith or promi&s;e of God without effect; but that they will have the joy of &s;eeing the accompli&s;hment thereof, in the ble&s;&s;ings of divine grace upon their children. But let us &s;hew that the doctrine of infant bapti&s;m is, with us, not a barren &s;peculation, but a com|forting encouraging and engaging motive to the di&s;charge of family duties. If we believe that God has re&s;erves of new cove|nant ble&s;&s;ings for our fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilies, according to his gracious promi&s;e, let us u&s;e the means in order to the conveyance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to them. And let us order our hou&s;e with piety, gravity and wi&s;dom, as becomes the church and hou&s;e of God, walking there|in with a perfect heart.</P>
<P>And though we would with plea&s;ure expre&s;s our chri&s;tian af|fection to tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from us in this point, when they ap|pear to be &s;incere in the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of the fundamen|tals of chri&s;tianity; yet I think we &s;hould not give any counte|nance to the attempts of tho&s;e who &s;et them&s;elves to v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ify and &s;et at nought our &s;acred admini&s;tration, and &s;our the minds of the &s;imple with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaven o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> uncharitablene&s;s and &s;chi&s;m. If we are e&s;tabli&s;hed in this truth, and have that love and zeal for it which we ought to have, we &s;hould not look on with cool indifference, while mi&s;taken men are endeavouring to rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of this &s;acred de|po&s;itum, delivered to the &s;aints. This article of our holy faith is of too much importance to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with. We &s;hould not act &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent a part, as to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thing that may &s;trengthen their hands, and give them an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, who would <Q>by fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple,</Q> and per&s;uade them to renounce communion with the churches of the &s;aints in the holy ordinances of Chri&s;t. And that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be able to contend for this truth with greater &s;kill and &s;ucce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, let us labour to be furni&s;hed with &s;uch clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">criptural arguments as may be &s;uffici|ent to convince, or at lea&s;t &s;ilence, gain&s;ayers.&mdash;Let us &s;tudy and dige&s;t well the rea&s;ons on which this doctrine and practice of the church is grounded, that &s;o we may all, to greater advantage, be fellow he pers to the truth. And we need not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, but that the cau&s;e of God will be &s;upported, and in the end will triumph, whatever oppo&s;ition may be made to it.</P>
<P>In the conclu&s;ion, I would turn my&s;elf to the ri&s;ing generation, who are the children of the covenant, and have, by bapti&s;m, been admitted into the church of God. After having &s;aid &s;o much for you, in pleading your cau&s;e, and maintaining your rights, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who would ca&s;t you out of the inheritance of the Lord, let me have your attention, while I &s;ay a few things to you. Be thankful to God, that he has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> plea&s;ed to inve&s;t you with the privileges, and lay you under the bonds, of his gracious covenant; and let the con|&s;ideration quicken and encourage you in &s;eeking and &s;erving
<PB N="91" REF="017187_0090_0FA072204C833388">the God of your fathers. Though the grace of the new co|venant be promi&s;ed, in a particular manner, to the children of God's covenant people, yet you are not to expect a &s;aving application of it to any of you, unle&s;s you diligently &s;eek for it, in the u&s;e of his appointed means. <Q>He will for this be enquired of by you.</Q> But for your encou|ragement, <Q>He hath not &s;aid to the &s;eed of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain.</Q> The&s;e promi&s;es furni&s;h the children of the covenant with a peculiar plea, in their prayers to God, for his converting and &s;anctifying grace. Avouch then your fa|thers God for your God; and let Ephraim's prayer be yours, <Q>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</Q> And labour to get a good under&s;tanding of the grounds and principles of the Chri&s;tian doctrine; but re&s;t not in a doctrinal knowledge, without a practical and experimental acquaintance with its divine power and efficacy to &s;anctify you in &s;pirit, &s;oul, and body. And as your place and &s;tanding in the church obliges you in duty, as well as gives you a vi&s;ible right, to attend all the ordi|nances which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted for the edification of his church, particularly the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper, I would now invite you to come to this &s;acred fea&s;t, with that due preparation which is required in a worthy approach thereto and by a &s;incere and &s;olemn recognition of your bapti&s;mal vows, make the act of your parents, in dedicat|ing you to God, your own act; and let your whole conver&s;ation be as becomes members of the church. As you belong to the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, labour to make proficiency daily under the in&s;tructions and di&s;cipline of it.&mdash;You are admitted into the &s;ociety of God's profe&s;&s;ing people; improve your rela|tion and connection with them for your improvement in the graces and virtues of the Chri&s;tian temper and life, that your may be daily growing up to the mea&s;ure of perfect men in Chri&s;t, and to a meetne&s;s to be partakers of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light. Be the companions of them that fear the Lord, and be not companions of fools.&mdash;<Q>He that walketh with the wi&s;e &s;hall be wi&s;e, but a companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e things have been often inculcated, and therefore I &s;hall not enlarge upon them; but &s;hall leave with you the &s;olemn charge of David to his beloved &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or: <Q>And now, my children, know the God of your fathers, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind; for the Lord &s;earcheth all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earts, and under&s;tandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you &s;eek him, be will be found of you; but if you for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t you off for ever.</Q></P>
