<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XIX.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><HI>&mdash;Sero &s;apiunt Phryges.</HI></Q>
<Q><L>Fal&s;e to <HI>your &s;elves,</HI> the <HI>people</HI> and the <HI>&s;tate,</HI></L>
<L>Like <HI>fooli&s;h Phrygians,</HI> you'll grow wi&s;e too late.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADMINISTRATION has now "let &s;lip the dogs of war, the helli&s;h Cerberus, with her three heads, Burgoyne, Howe, and Clinton, is &s;ailed. The dogmatic goo&s;e quil of the fallacious Dr. John&s;on, that hireling Quixote of an hireling mini&s;try, has promulgated a &s;o|lemn &s;entence of attainder again&s;t all revolutioni&s;ts in Great-Britain;&mdash;Hear it ye Whigs,
<Q><L>"And put in ev'ry hone&s;t hand a whip,</L>
<L>"To la&s;h the ra&s;cal naked thro' the world."</L></Q></P>
<P>This pitiful retailer of apologies for mini&s;terial treachery, has had the impudence to declare with the effrontery of a Sandwich, or a Denbigh, that whoever wi&s;hes &s;ucce&s;s to America is a traitor to his country.</P>
<P>From this patriotic declaration, I pre&s;ume the redoubted Doctor is at length admitted into the Ar|cana of the mini&s;try. He pronounces with as
<PB N="158" REF="013985_0002_0F9259A0B9A6B678">much in&s;olence as if he was a&s;&s;ured of their inten|tions to pa&s;s a bill, (they have voices enough to do it,) for declaring a new &s;pecies of trea&s;on, namely, the wi&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s to oppre&s;&s;ed America. I will venture to &s;ay, that every revolutioni&s;t in England, Ireland, and the &s;ugar colonies, have long &s;ince in|curred the pains and penalties of this law in embryo, if &s;uch a one there be.</P>
<P>No Engli&s;hman can wear two faces: Therefore if his Maje&s;ty, &s;hould for the future, &s;ee as much ill humour and contempt in the faces of his Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h &s;ubjects, as they ob&s;erve in his, he mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed. Bute and Mansfield, will in&s;truct him that the a&s;pects and affections of a people are beneath the notice of a &s;overeign who inherits them. But con&s;cience in the depth of night, will &s;peak another language, that will remind him, that he has rejected the &s;upplications of millions in America, that he has at length a&s;&s;ented to their mur|der, that he has with an iron tongue and an iron heart, rung the knell of expiring America.</P>
<P>It is a maxim of our law, (&s;ays the hone&s;t chan|cellor Forte&s;cue) that no man was ever yet con|demned or &s;entenced by the mouth of the King him&s;elf:&mdash;'tis not &s;o now,&mdash;the pre&s;ent &s;overeign has been advi&s;ed to declare preremptorily to his &s;up|plicating citizens of London, that,
<Q>he is determi|ned to pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures which his wi&s;e parlia|ment have recommended.</Q> We know that the&s;e are not conciliating but de&s;tructive mea&s;ures: Un|der the&s;e mea&s;ures America is either to be de&s;troyed, or lo&s;t forever to this nation.</P>
<P>The late royal an&s;wer to the petition of the city of London, fairly interpreted, would run thus;
<PB N="159" REF="013985_0003_0F9259A1ACEE0788">Let it &s;peak the language of de&s;poti&s;m in de&s;potic terms, viz.
<Q>Slaves, by daring thus to remind us of our oppre&s;&s;ions in America, you are your&s;elves traitors; by this libellous petition you aid and en|courage rebels. It is the duty of loyal &s;ubjects pa&s;&s;ively to obey our will. Our will and plea&s;ure is revenge. This re&s;olve we think fit to notify by famine and the &s;word. The&s;e are the lenient mea&s;ures, which our Divan has advi&s;ed, and the&s;e we will pur&s;ue. Your confidence and affection we de&s;pi&s;e, we confide alone in the wi&s;dom of our Divan, by that great council your fancied rights and your de&s;picable commerce are wi&s;ely doomed, with our entire concurrence, to de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how ea&s;ily a deluded chri&s;tian prince may &s;peak the language of an ea&s;tern tyrant; for this purpo&s;e we have fairly cloathed an ea&s;tern &s;pi|rit, in an ea&s;tern garb; we have given the haughty &s;overeign's plain meaning in proper words; we have not (like Lord Mansfield, who penned the vile harrangue) meanly &s;uffered the &s;entiments of an in&s;olent mogul to be cramped by the poverty of princely diction.</P>
<P>Upon Bute's and Mansfield's plans, &s;overeigns are divine vicegerents, &s;ent down from heaven, not in mercy, but in wrath, to indulge their own im|pious lu&s;ts, and &s;courge mankind. Let &s;uch &s;o|vereigns, therefore, be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; let them equally di&s;dain the fetters of language and humanity&mdash;Let them &s;peak daggers to their people and &s;alvation to their minions. But can &s;uch a prince, con&s;cious that his parliament has been in|famou&s;ly &s;muggled, by a mean and execrable &s;trength of the prerogative, (a &s;udden di&s;&s;olution)
<PB N="160" REF="013985_0004_0F9259A3989507A0">for fear of a national a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t future treachery; con&s;cious that the majority of his and his mini&s;ter's great council (it is no national council) are a &s;et of hirelings, filched into their &s;eats, and corrupted to promote every de&s;potic lu&s;t of a de|luded monarch; can &s;uch a con&s;cious prince pro|nounce the doom of millions, not only without emotion, but with compo&s;ed &s;tupidity? This is not fortitude, but callo&s;ity of &s;oul.</P>
<P>The whole European world is a&s;toni&s;hed at our per&s;ecution of America, even foreign, and de&s;potic princes, upon this occa&s;ion, have different feelings, from the father of that people who are de&s;tined to de&s;truction: Even princes, who can &s;end forth &s;word and famine by a nod, are a&s;toni&s;hed at our wicked policy, and abhor it; even the natural ene|mies of Great-Britain pre&s;ume to interfere with our infernal admini&s;tration, they will not permit our government (without reproaches, in&s;ults, threats, and animated declarations) to ma&s;&s;acre mankind: France, under the ma&s;k of humanity, pre&s;umes to make us &s;en&s;ible of her great conde&s;cen&s;ion, mag|nanimity, and moderation, in &s;uffering American murder to pa&s;s on freely and without controul. She makes us under&s;tand that &s;he connives at this &s;laughter of our gallant &s;ubjects, for the &s;ake of cultivating a good under&s;tanding with the king of Great-Britain, and the whole Engli&s;h nation. But when &s;he finds (as &s;he &s;hortly may) that this king and kingdom are divided and trying the claim of freedom together in the field with France, who profe&s;&s;es &s;o much magnanimity and moderation, remain neuter? Her humanity, her honour will not &s;uffer her. She will retaliate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> former inter|po&s;itions
<PB N="161" REF="013985_0005_0F9259A3D70CE8D0">in her government with the like &s;trokes of political humanity. Spain, who has &s;o lately felt the force of Engli&s;h arms, will not permit us to turn them &s;o unnaturally again&s;t our&s;elves. She &s;peaks in plainer terms: Let his per&s;evering maje|&s;ty hear her humane menaces: She tells him bold|ly, that &s;he will not tie up her hands from relieving fellow creatures &s;uffering under wanton unprovoked oppre&s;&s;ion. Alas! blind, infatuated &s;overeign.&mdash; Can&s;t thou not di&s;cern the tendency of this artful Spani&s;h declaration? Does not Spain already hold out &s;uccour to America? Will not injured and de|&s;pairing people embrace the offer? Will they not rather &s;ubmit to be aided by an enemy than mur|dered by a parent? Will they not &s;ooner change their names, their laws, their government, their re|ligion, in ju&s;t re&s;entment, than enjoy the&s;e flatter|ing modes, the&s;e &s;ounding nothings in a &s;tate of &s;lavery? Think again, wi&s;e Sire, before it is too late. Let me a&s;k thee, thou clement pious &s;ove|reign, are not the people, in who&s;e favour Spain hath thus declared, thy fellow creatures al&s;o? Were they not under the ju&s;t reign of your lamented grandfather, your fellow &s;ubjects too? Could he ari&s;e, one hone&s;t frown from him, would di&s;per&s;e your minions, annihilate your pride, bla&s;t your ex|ecrable politics, and re&s;tore peace, commerce, and protection, to the tottering con&s;titution of the Bri|ti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h nation is brave, her pretext for in|terpo&s;ing is a noble one; tho' merely political, it is to be preferred to that which is tyrannical; it has, at lea&s;t, a plau&s;ible appearance, for it &s;peaks the language of ju&s;tice, benevolence, and humanity.
<PB N="162" REF="013985_0006_0F9259A48F24D8A8">We find neither of the&s;e ingredients in the rigid an&s;wer which lately repelled the petition of the city. <HI>Fas e&s;t et ab ho&s;te doceri.</HI></P>
<P>Let Bute and Mansfield, the leaders of an infa|mous admini&s;tration, let their great council their parliament (I &s;ay again it is not the nation's) let the head con&s;table of this kingdom (the dupe of all the herd) for once receive in&s;tructions from an ene|my. The Spaniards di&s;tingui&s;h ju&s;tly between a &s;overeign's right of reducing refractory &s;ubjects to ju&s;t obedience, and making war upon humble &s;up|plicants who petition for their rights. They di&s;|cern a difference (and there is a wide one) between ju&s;t re&s;i&s;tance and unnatural rebellion. They tell us in manly (to America they are tempting) terms that America &s;hall not &s;uffer unheared, unpitied, unredre&s;&s;ed, and innocent. Tho' a venal and cor|rupt majority, to gratify de&s;potic &s;pleen, have in a bloody act, &s;tiled America rebellious, yet what &s;anction can &s;uch laws derive from venality and cor|ruption? Laws, to be &s;acred and obligatory mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of God, nature, rea&s;on, found policy and the con&s;titution of the kingdom. If they err in the&s;e re&s;pects, it is an error in the fir&s;t concoction, they are ab&s;olutely null and void in them&s;elves, and are no more to be regarded than "the laws of a parcel of drunken porters." I borrow this elegant compari&s;on from the mouth of a great man, who is, at one and the &s;ame time, a privy coun&s;ellor, a pen&s;ioner, a placeman, and a &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons. Situations as compatible with that of &s;peaker, as obligatory laws are with venality and corruption.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay that rebellious &s;ubjects are not to be
<PB N="163" REF="013985_0007_0F9259A92E2F0F20">cha&s;ti&s;ed; but they mu&s;t fir&s;t rebel, all civil cha&s;|ti&s;ement be&s;ides, mu&s;t be inflicted by the hand of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, not by the &s;courge of the op|pre&s;&s;or. The wanton power that aggre&s;&s;es and af|flicts, ought not to puni&s;h, but redre&s;s. What poli|tical wi&s;dom is there in driving a whole territory, a great nation of obedient (tho' not pa&s;&s;ive) &s;ubjects to de&s;pair? What wi&s;dom in loo&s;ing or extermina|ting? What ju&s;tice in refu&s;ing to hear the &s;uppo|&s;ed delinquent before &s;he turned &s;upplication into rage.</P>
<P>America profe&s;&s;es all legal, but like the brave ance&s;try from whence &s;he &s;prings, di&s;dains pa&s;&s;ive obedience, &s;he honours and revers kings, but de|&s;pi&s;es and defies tyrants.</P>
<P>If &s;he conquers &s;he will continue to &s;upport the liberty &s;he wins, if &s;he falls, (believe me ye wretched, ye &s;hallow mini&s;terial politicians!) &s;he will not fall unrevenged, the crowns of France and Spain, will not continue neuter, they will be the providential means of puni&s;hing our iniquity to America; they will embroil a civil war here, and a&s;&s;i&s;t it there, they will conquer England in Ame|rica, they will be received there with open arms; in the la&s;t agonies of American de&s;pair, they will be received as conquerors, and u&s;urping tyranny, will be expelled forever.</P>
<P>America <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> never conde&s;cend to enjoy the un|e&s;&s;ential name of Engli&s;hmen under the lawle&s;s power, of a grand Mogul, and his dete&s;ted Divan.</P>
