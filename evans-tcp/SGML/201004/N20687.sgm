<P>THE general intention of occa&s;ions like the pre&s;ent, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be rather amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure than real improvement; and the &s;peaker may be thought to have performed his duty, if he &s;hall have gratified the imagi|nation, or animated the pa&s;&s;ions of his audience. Although this be plea&s;ing to the mind, and ought not to be altogether above our pre&s;ent aim: yet, exi&s;ting circum&s;tances demand &s;omething more u&s;eful than plea&s;ure, and more &s;erious than amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>ON this day, which is &s;et apart by the COLUMBIAN ORDER, to celebrate their Anniver&s;ary, and to renew, in a public manner, their mutual tokens of brotherhood, of friend&s;hip, and of patrioti&s;m&mdash;At this period when all Europe is involved in confu&s;ion, and wrapt in war, and when even the peaceful hemi&s;phere of this We&s;tern world begins to redden with the martial flame&mdash;At this critical &s;ea&s;on, when the intere&s;ts of our country demand one heart, and one &s;oul, and one uplifted arm; and when our enemies may be privately employed in &s;owing di&s;&s;entions among us, and dividing our &s;trength; what &s;ubject &s;hould equally arre&s;t our attention; what is of comparative importance with
<PB N="6" REF="027169_0006_0FD392F561EE7A48">UNION: The proper influence of this principle will diffu&s;e harmony through all ranks, will encrea&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h the advantages of the nation, will make &s;trong and formi|dable what before was contemptible and weak, and will al|ways oppo&s;e an impenetrable phalanx to the bold front of ap|proaching danger.</P>
<P>YOUR attention will, therefore, be called to this intere&s;t|ing &s;ubject, which naturally divides it&s;elf into two branches, the UNION of the STATES, and UNION of SENTI|MENT.</P>
<P>WHO can ca&s;t his eyes over this exten&s;ive region, and traver&s;e our country from New-Hamp&s;hire on the north, to Georgia on the &s;outh, and not perceive that PROVIDENCE de&s;igned us to be a great and <HI>united</HI> nation? Our lines are marked by the very hand of nature. On the ea&s;t the At|lantic wa&s;hes a various and exten&s;ive coa&s;t; on the we&s;t, the broad and rapid Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi pours its &s;tream along; and on the north the river St. Lawrance, and a chain of augu&s;t lakes, form a natural boundary. Within the&s;e limits marked by in|variable lines, and abundantly exten&s;ive for the purpo&s;es of one empire, do we not find a variety of climate and of &s;oil, and a rich diver&s;ity of productions, &s;ufficient for all the con|veniencies and elegancies of life? Have we not hence, ample re&s;ources within the bo&s;om of our country, which, from their very nature, are inexhau&s;tible, and which require nothing but our united exertions to be adequate to every u&s;eful purpo&s;e? Inve&s;ted by nature with &s;trength, it belongs to us to avail our&s;elves of it, and to become expert in all the modes of its appropriation. But di&s;union would defeat the&s;e beneficent purpo&s;es of nature, and totally annihilate tho&s;e advantages which a kind PROVIDENCE has con|ferred.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="027169_0007_0FD392F75DCCC4D8">
THE particular advantages attendant on the clo&s;e and continued UNION of the States, ari&s;e from a variety of &s;ources, are evident upon the lea&s;t reflection, and are equally certain as to their favourable con&s;equences. Not to mention the powerful influence which Union would have on MORALITY, the pure&s;t fountain of national happine&s;s and glory&mdash;Does not COMMERCE always flouri&s;h in proportion to the excellence of commodities, and the &s;afety and facility of reciprocal interchange? and are not the pro|ductions of our country although various, yet generally ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life, and requi&s;ite for the wants of civilized &s;ociety? Union would therefore give occa&s;ion to a continued and encrea&s;ing exchange of commodities be|tween the different States, to their mutual convenience and emolument. And, if the wealth of a country be an object both &s;plendid and u&s;eful, the &s;pirit of Commerce, like the breeze which fills the &s;ail, &s;hould breathe freely and uncon|fined. But though this dome&s;tic commerce &s;hould not pro|duce the mo&s;t exorbitant wealth, yet what it does afford, will be conveniently and with little hazard, acquired: Be|&s;ides, it ought to be remembered, that a nation becomes happy and elegant, not &s;o much by the mere accumulation of wealth, as by the rapid circulation of that wealth, in the different channels of indu&s;try. This is the powerful cau&s;e which throws life and vigour into every department; gives a &s;pring of con&s;tant activity to the public mind, and diffu&s;es a poli&s;h and agreeable &s;plendor over the face of &s;ociety. Who can be made to believe that this country would derive half that &s;trength, half that re&s;pectability, half that degree of glory from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mines of Mexico and Peru, which &s;he would obtain from a &s;mall proportion of that wealth, acquired by labor, by the hazard of enter|prize,
<PB N="8" REF="027169_0008_0FD392F838131658">and by the exertions of genius? Let the proprietors of tho&s;e golden mountains examplify the truth which the que&s;tion &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P>THERE is another advantage intimately connected with COMMERCE, and of no le&s;s importantce than Commerce it&s;elf: By a frequent intercour&s;e between the citizens of the&s;e States, manners, cu&s;toms, and language, would conti|nually a&s;&s;imilate; little a&s;perities would gradually wear away; till, after a certain period, one &s;pirit of friend&s;hip would pervade, and one &s;oul of harmony actuate the whole of this free empire. This repre&s;entation is not the ideal fabric of fancy, it is founded on the nature of &s;ociety, and will certainly be the happy con&s;equence of a firmly cement|ed UNION.</P>
<P>IF the &s;ubject be viewed in a POLITICAL point of light the advantages of Union will appear equally obvious and &s;triking. The policy of a mea&s;ure always re&s;ults from its nature, and from attendant circum&s;tances. The very &s;ituation of the country, both natural and civil, exhibits the high policy of union. Are we not &s;urrounded with a huge chain which &s;eems to have been purpo&s;ely de&s;igned to em|brace within its mighty circumference, the intere&s;ts, the hap|pine&s;s, the liberties of one great nation? So weighty is this chain and at pre&s;ent &s;o &s;trong, that it will not only require an unnatural and violent concu&s;&s;ion to bur&s;t its links a&s;un|der; but if once broken, it will probably remain, in defiance of art or &s;trength, of policy or danger, forever &s;eparate, and for ever widning into a greater cha&s;m.</P>
<P>CONTEMPLATING the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, when &s;mall colonies planted them&s;elves in different parts of the American territory, &s;ome preferring the Northern and
<PB N="9" REF="027169_0009_0FD392FC09719658">&s;ome the Southern regions, it is ea&s;y to perceive that a con&s;i|derable difference would obtain in the appearance, in the lives, and in the manners of this widely &s;cattered &s;ociety. But, as they chiefly came from one nation, as they &s;poke one language, as they naturally imbibed the &s;ame ideas of civil government, and drank of the &s;ame &s;pirit of freedom; it is as ea&s;y to perceive that they would, upon the great &s;cale, be marked by a general &s;imilarity; and be, in fact, ONE PEO|PLE. Here, then, we &s;ee diver&s;ity amid &s;imilarity, and a con&s;iderable variety amid a general uniformity. What con&s;equence ought properly to flow from the&s;e &s;eparate qua|lities? Independent and unconnected States? No. This would be a violation of the principle of uniformity. Ought it then to be one compact and con&s;olidated empire? This would equally violate the principle of diver&s;ity. The only ju&s;t and natural con&s;equence would be both a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>general</HI> government. This would not be the re&s;ult of a hand|&s;ome theory, or a choice from the wide field of &s;peculation; it would ari&s;e from the very nature of the country, and from the civil &s;ituation of its inhabitants. You perceive, then, my fellow-citizens, that the PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, in forming their pre&s;ent political compact, have conformed to their re&s;pective local and rela|tive po&s;itions, and acted upon the generous plan which the hand of nature had previou&s;ly &s;ketched. With &s;imilar wi&s;|dom will a people always act, if they enter into deliberation; and, on &s;uch important &s;ubjects, they will always deliberate, if they are free. The governments which we have made for our&s;elves, and under which we happily live, are both particular and general. And, if the nation have prudence to keep the wheels of each revolving within their proper &s;phere, &s;ufficiently confined to prevent too wide a deviation;
<PB N="10" REF="027169_0010_0FD39301324F1EB0">yet, &s;ufficiently loo&s;e to move with facility; may we not hope that, like the &s;un, and the planets which roll round his orb, their revolutions will be performed with equal beauty and harmony, till, the frame of nature disjointed, annihilate all human works, in order to introduce divine?</P>
<P>IF the pre&s;ent <HI>Federal Union</HI> be di&s;olved; one of the&s;e two con&s;equences mu&s;t, if not immediately, yet not very re|motely, follow&mdash;either a CONSOLIDATED EMPIRE, or &s;everal DISTINCT and UNCONNECTED STATES. Would not the fir&s;t require &s;uch a high-toned government, &s;uch an exorbitant proportion of power in the executive, and &s;uch a va&s;t multiplicity of officers flowing from it, that the mild influence of law would &s;oon yield to the &s;uperior &s;way of official authority? And if one department embrace &s;uch an undue proportion of power, will not its appetite increa&s;e in a &s;imilar ratio? Will it probably be ever &s;atiated till it have &s;wallowed up the two other departments of go|vernment? Where, then, will be your priviledges, your laws of freedom, and your glorious republican edifice? When the imperial power began at Rome, it amu&s;ed the people with the continuance of the con&s;ular autho|rity, and other popular e&s;tabli&s;hments, at the &s;ame time that it was gradually ab&s;orbing their &s;trength, till noth|ing was left, but the &s;hadow and paltry form of liberty&mdash;till in fact, the con&s;ulate, that dignified office, which awaken&punc; the ambition of a Cato and a Tully, and other true patriots, became &s;o degraded, that a <HI>hor&s;e</HI> was once inve&s;ted with its honors, and I &s;uppo&s;e performed very well, all the duties which it then embraced. So, perhaps, a con&s;olidated go|vernment, wrapped in the &s;pecious veil of forbearance and flattery, would at fir&s;t move ea&s;ily along, and pre&s;s as light|ly
<PB N="11" REF="027169_0011_0FD3930300E9CB90">as po&s;&s;ible upon the public mind: but how &s;oon would it be like the "letting out of waters", at fir&s;t gently pre&s;&s;ing through a narrow breach; till, wearing a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;age, they &s;weep along with the fury of a torrent, impetuous and irre&s;i&s;tible!</P>
<P>WHAT is meant by this word <HI>Con&s;olidation?</HI> It has a &s;trong and compact &s;ound, and &s;eems &s;omewhat formidable in its very appearance. It expre&s;&s;es very well its peculiar meaning. What is it but forcing into one ma&s;s uniform and undi&s;tingui&s;hable that which is by nature, by rea&s;on, and the power of habit, beautifully diver&s;ifyed? What is it in fine, but a total de&s;truction of the State Governments? And if the&s;e be once demoli&s;hed, where is the guardian who can &s;o well in&s;pect the affairs, &s;o well attend to the wants, &s;o intimately feel the particular intere&s;ts of the peo|people? Can one eye, however wakeful and piercing, watch the &s;acred depo&s;it with as much &s;afety, as the quick and vivid glance of fifteen Sovereign and United States? If you level the&s;e elevations, on what will you a&s;cend to view the ever varying a&s;pects of the political horizon? If you throw down the&s;e watch towers, whence will you at the encroachment of foreign or civil tyranny, &s;ound &s;o legally the dire alarm? But the American people are too wi&s;e, are too happy&mdash;they have drank too deep of the &s;weet &s;tream of liberty, and perceive too clearly the advantages of a <HI>federal</HI> union, not to feel them&s;elves rou&s;ed and indignant at the thoughts of con&s;olidation. Their voice is unanimous for UNION and FREEDOM, except perhaps a trifling few who &s;igh for <HI>garters,</HI> for <HI>ribbons,</HI> and for <HI>&s;tars,</HI> pretty royal play things&mdash;and who would &s;ell their rights and their country, for a &s;ong.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027169_0012_0FD3930476172EE8">
BUT, &s;uppo&s;ing that the di&s;&s;olution of the federal union, in|&s;tead of terminating in con&s;olidation, &s;hould widen into &s;epa|rate and unconnected &s;overeignties, would our &s;ituation be more eligible? If the union be broken, at the &s;ame moment will decline the common &s;pirit of affection which &s;o happily pervades this country. The Georgian would no more call the Carolinian brother; and the Penn&s;ylvanian and New-Yorker would begin to eye each other with "mutual a&s;pect malign." If the union be di&s;&s;olved, at that in&s;tant &s;tart up in horrid &s;hapes, different intere&s;ts, contrary &s;entiments, &s;elfi&s;h views, with all the hated pa&s;&s;ions which pride and mad ambition fire. Though at pre&s;ent the &s;everal &s;tates are acknowledged to have intere&s;ts &s;omewhat different, yet they are held in harmonious arrangment, and are made to promote their mutual advantage by the powerful and be|nign influence of Union. But the moment that band is bur&s;t, that moment they all fly at random; mix and cla&s;h and jar with horrid concu&s;&s;ion, till they produce one di&s;mal &s;cene of woe and confu&s;ion. So a machine, completed by the perfection of mechanic art, performs its operations in equal and orderly movements, till, &s;hocked too rudely by &s;ome un&s;kilful hand, the governing power gives way, and all the work &s;uddenly &s;inks into total di&s;order. Or, to compare great things with &s;mall, thus, the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, re|volving through the va&s;t of nature in &s;ublime and cele&s;tial harmony, if once loo&s;ened from the mighty influence of at|traction, would exhibit beneath the cope of heaven, pla|nets, and &s;uns, and comets, in dire di&s;order&mdash;now darting in|to the immen&s;ity of &s;pace&mdash;now cla&s;hing with horrid and loud jarring di&s;cord, till the whole univer&s;e has ru&s;hed into rapid ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="027169_0013_0FD3930926B6B4A0">
IF therefore, we were &s;plit by &s;ome di&s;cordant power into &s;everal unconected &s;overeignties, we &s;hould probably &s;oon repent of the change. Was there not, about the time of forming the new con&s;titution, &s;ome &s;erious conver&s;ation re&s;pecting a divi&s;ion of the American nation into three grand departments&mdash;the northern, the middle, and the &s;outhern? Where the lines of &s;eparation were to run, I believe ne|ver was, and it is to be hoped, never will be a&s;certained. For, it is an incontrovertible maxim, that &s;o long as human nature continues the &s;ame, &s;imilar circum&s;tances will always give ri&s;e to &s;imilar events. And, as &s;oon as we are a divided people, our &s;ituation with re&s;pect to each other, will be like that of the Europeans; and, very probably, we &s;hall act over again, tho&s;e &s;cenes of famous folly which they have al|ready acted. One of our <HI>new made empires,</HI> perhaps the pre&s;ent &s;tate of New-York, may fancy that &s;he has received &s;ome in&s;ult from another of our <HI>new made empires;</HI> the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. We mu&s;t pre&s;erve our dignity; we mu&s;t keep our honor free from &s;tain; we will be treated with more re&s;pect. What! &s;hall our national &s;overeignty be trampled upon by that proud and imperious people? No. We &s;hall teach her a le&s;&s;on of humility, and convince her to her &s;orrow, that in provoking the re&s;entment of Yorkers, the has rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of heroes. Have we not a firm band of patriotic citizens, who will &s;tep forth with proud obe|dience, to vindicate the national honor? Have we not twenty thou&s;and hardy &s;ons of the north, who&s;e brea&s;ts burn for the conflict, and who would glory to reduce that haughty rival? And if the&s;e be not &s;ufficient, is not the brave nation of Ver|mont always prepared for battle, and always ready to join in league with their former brothers of New-York? Thus, my fellow-citizens, would we &s;oon &s;well with pride, adopt
<PB N="14" REF="027169_0014_0FD3930AF09D1568">the language and imitate the de&s;tructive conduct of the European nations. League would be added to league, not with the view of repelling common danger, or promoting mutual happine&s;s; but for the diabolical purpo&s;e of national revenge. And, dreadful to tell, tho&s;e who now conceive their pro&s;perity to be reciprocal; who are united by habits, by principle, by affection; and who form the mo&s;t amiable and beautiful republic on the earth, would, like the bea&s;ts of the de&s;art, furiou&s;ly &s;pring upon and devour each other.</P>
<P>WOULD not every thing, were we once di&s;united, invite to aggre&s;&s;ion and ho&s;tility? Our contiguity of &s;ituation, our open and exten&s;ive &s;ea-coa&s;t, the weakne&s;s of &s;ome and the &s;trength of other &s;tates, would quickly excite ideas of agran|dizement, and afford frequent occa&s;ions for mutual inva&s;ion and conque&s;t. Plunder would &s;oon become our trade, and war and murder our national glory. It has been confe&s;&s;ed that the intere&s;ts of the &s;tates are &s;omewhat different; di&s;|union would greatly augment tho&s;e differences, and con&s;e|quently occa&s;ion them more frequently to interfere and cla&s;h. Each &s;tate pur&s;uing its own objects, not only without the &s;pirit of accommodation, but with the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, would con&s;true each cau&s;ual cla&s;hing into de&s;igned provoca|tion, and they would decide their differences by a ha&s;ty ap|peal to arms. For it is very improbable that the complai&s;ant principle of forbearance and negociation, by which we are at pre&s;ent characterized, would in our di&s;putes with one another, be ob&s;erved with &s;uch &s;crupulous punctuality.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;uppo&s;ing what is indeed very difficult to be imagined, that the &s;eparated States, &s;hould never light up the torch of war in defiance of each other, what would be their &s;ituation
<PB N="15" REF="027169_0015_0FD3930CD3A816D8">with re&s;pect to foreign powers? If forbearance would pre|vent injury, if uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion would keep in&s;ult at a di&s;|tance, if tamene&s;s and cowardice would occa&s;ion the return of re&s;pect and honor; then, and not till then, might di&s;uni|ted America flatter her&s;elf with the peace and friend&s;hip of Tran&s;atlantic Courts. But, if broken a&s;under, &s;hall we not become weak in the extreme? And, if weak, &s;hall we not in|vite the attacks of every lawle&s;s invader? Do we not know that the &s;tronge&s;t motive for in&s;uring ju&s;tice, is to be in a &s;itu|ation to inforce it? And, that the mo&s;t effectual argument to pre&s;erve peace, is to be prepared and formidable for war? Who does not know that to rely upon the di&s;intere&s;ted good will of foreign Courts, is to take grimace for &s;incerity, for|mality for wi&s;dom, the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance, and Satan him&s;elf for an angel of light? But, even if the Tran&s;atlan|tic Nations &s;hould be &s;o <HI>&s;ingularly politie,</HI> as not to harra&s;s our trade, invade our &s;eparated territory, or attempt our &s;ubjugation; yet, how could we keep our&s;elves without the dreadful vortex of their dark and my&s;terious politics? In &s;uch a complicated labyrinth of corruption and oppre&s;&s;ion; in &s;uch a di&s;mal aby&s;s of inju&s;tice and tyranny, if we are once in|volved, we &s;hall probably be involved forever. We &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to acquire the habits of perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to enter with reluctant acquie&s;cence into every courtly project. The blood of that heroic nation, which once flow|ed &s;o freely in the cau&s;e of liberty and of man, would &s;tain the cold &s;oil of &s;lavery, and be wa&s;ted in the &s;ervice of ambi|tion, and of de&s;poti&s;m. O my country! if once thou art di&s;united, what prophetic eye can fore&s;ee all thy calamities; what pen can de&s;cribe, or what tongue relate all thy woes! From being the beauty of the whole earth, and the wide a&s;&s;ylum of oppre&s;&s;ed millions; thou &s;halt thy&s;elf become a &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion, of &s;lavery, of blood!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="027169_0016_0FD3930E140C9D38">
YOUR eyes, my fellow citizens, &s;hall probably never witne&s;s &s;uch an awful change. But, it is our duty as men, as chri&s;tians, as members of a free republic, to make the greate&s;t exertions in order to pre&s;erve to the late&s;t ages, the &s;acred rights and priviledges of the nation. How will this important object be accompli&s;hed, but by the happie&s;t influence of Union?</P>
<P>BUT, will the UNION of America en&s;ure all that advan|tage which it was calculated and expected to produce&mdash;will it acquire vigor and permanency&mdash;will it, in a word, be more than half complete, if it be a union only as to FORM, with|out the UNION of SENTIMENT? This is that &s;ecret power, which fir&s;t attracted, and &s;till binds, in the tie of ge|nuine affection, the hearts of Americans. This is the electric fluid, which fired in any part, &s;uddenly vibrates through the whole. This is that intimate &s;ympathy, which nature has im|planted, which habit has refined, and which external force &s;hall never de&s;troy.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS have been the motives, and frequent the &s;ea|&s;ons, which have excited in the brea&s;ts of Americans, the &s;ame glow of valor, the &s;ame throb of freedom, the &s;ame &s;entiments of patrioti&s;m; when their heroes in&s;pired by the love of their country, fought &s;ide by &s;ide, on the en|&s;anguined plain; and, for their children, their friends, and and the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of humanity, freely mingled their pure&s;t blood. See! it flows in immortal &s;treams around the land of freedom, and may it forever flow, and form the eter|nal line which tyranny &s;hall never pa&s;s: Say, ye defenders of your country; ye, who ardently &s;ought the po&s;t of dan|ger; who dared the utmo&s;t fury of the &s;torm, and &s;tood un|daunted amid the "rocking of the battlements"; &s;ay, were
<PB N="17" REF="027169_0017_0FD39310EA315888">ye not animate^1 with one &s;ublime and patriotic &s;entiment, which illuminated and in&s;pired the glorious efforts of Ame|rica? But, does not the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on equally demand, equally urge, equally enforce a firmly cemented Union of all the civic and military virtues? Does not this mo|ment call aloud, on all men who love the reign of free|dom, who de&s;ire the happine&s;s of mankind, who pray for the peace and pro&s;perity of America&mdash;to lay a&s;ide their &s;maller differences, to &s;trengthen them&s;elves for the &s;ervice of their country, and to brighten into lu&s;tre the high hope of patrioti&s;m? The alarm, it is true, has not yet called our citizen &s;oldiers to the field of danger: the foe does not yet march, to &s;pread havoc and de&s;olation over your fertile plains; to &s;tain, with horrid joy, his hands of cruelty in the blood of your reverend fires, and your innocent children; to ravi&s;h from your arms the wife of your bo&s;om, or in&s;ult the virgin of your love. Ho&s;tile armor does not yet dazzle the affrighted eye, nor does the cannon's dire explo&s;ion an|nounce the near approach of terror. What then, my be|loved countrymen? Is this a time when the UNITED flames of love &s;hould burn languid, or be mixed with jealous fires? Is this a time of lei&s;ure to attend to the whi&s;pers of party, or to lend an ear to the clamourous voice of faction? Is this a period in which you ought to fancy your&s;elves &s;e|cure, your glorious privileges beyond the hazard of inva&s;ion, and your country perfectly free from danger? Will liberty in America remain at peace, and triumph undi&s;turbed; when in Europe, &s;he is attacked by the whole force of de&s;poti&s;m, and threatened with extirpation and death? Behold there the &s;cenes of blood and horror which rapidly &s;trike the eye, and give agony to the mind! Peace has retired far off, and all the milder virtues follow weeping in her train! War with
<PB N="18" REF="027169_0018_0FD3931526F7EFD8">all his dreadful throng, famines, conflagrations, pe&s;tilences, and deaths, ravages the faire&s;t abodes of man! Nothing is heard but noi&s;e, and tumult, and the loudly reitera|ted &s;hout of battle. Nothing &s;een but ho&s;tile preparations, and weapons drenched in human gore. All the atmo&s;phere is black and turbid; all the &s;ky dreadfully &s;treaked with fire! See the huge armies ru&s;hing to the fierce on&s;et, flaming with revenge! Front oppo&s;ed to front, is &s;tretched out, as far as &s;ight can di&s;tingui&s;h the lengthened line. The nodding plume, the proudly prancing &s;teed, the dazzling of armor, and the banners unfurled, announce the dreadful approach. At the emboldening &s;ound of martial mu&s;ic, &s;lowly advances the moving terror. The grandeur of the &s;cene, increa&s;ing with the danger, in&s;pires an awful elevation of foul. With an eye that &s;peaks de&s;perate deeds, and with determined a&s;|pect they advance to a fearful interval&mdash;where death awaits the carnage&mdash;The mu&s;ic makes a moment's pau&s;e, and uni|ver&s;al &s;ilence reigns, except where the clattering of armor, the tremor of the hor&s;es, and the perturbation of a hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls, excite through all the ho&s;t a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, which murmurs on the ear like the di&s;tant roar of dying thunders. All at once the the drum's in&s;piring &s;ound, and and the trumpet's &s;hrill clangor, call to high atchievements, and to feats of glory. The in&s;truments of de&s;truction are levelled, and a thou&s;and deaths fly hi&s;&s;ing through the air. Blood &s;tains the earth, and the &s;ight of blood in&s;pires with fiercer courage, and more de&s;perate revenge. On they ru&s;h, regardle&s;s of the companion falling at their &s;ide, and the fiery-mouthed cannon di&s;gorging in&s;tant ruin. Involved in &s;moke, the ho&s;tile fronts meet. Now the cla&s;hing &s;words, the exploding mu&s;ketry, the continued roar of thunder, with the doleful &s;hrieks of the wounded, and the &s;houts of victory,
<PB N="19" REF="027169_0019_0FD39317B477BF58">a&s;&s;ail the ear, and ri&s;e in mingled confu&s;ion to heaven. But &s;ee? through this dread darkne&s;s, a glory bur&s;ts, and &s;heds a lu&s;tre on the di&s;mal &s;cene. Behold! &s;urrounded with a radient cloud, LIBERTY in her triumphal car, "rides in this whirlwind and directs the &s;torm." On her right, &s;its victory fla&s;hing terror. The va&s;t concave of heaven far re&s;ounds to thunder of her call&mdash;FREEDOM or DEATH! De&s;po|ti&s;m hears agha&s;t the reverberating roar, and from his iron throne &s;tarts in trepidation and di&s;may.</P>
<P>HERETOFORE, in the conte&s;ts of the mighty, Liberty has &s;eldom appeared; and when &s;he has, &s;he was generally ac|companied with misfortune and defeat. But men have ac|quired the knowledge of their rights, and the dark reign of delu&s;ion has vani&s;hed. From the vigorous arm of our brave allies, has de&s;poti&s;m received his mortal wound. This is the cau&s;e of the Mon&s;ter's &s;truggling &s;o violently, and bel|lowing &s;o loud. But, remember that his &s;inews are of iron, and his bones of bra&s;s; and, that his agony in death will be direful. He may yet make the effort of de&s;pair, and wrap the whole world in flames.</P>
<P>WHO knows how thin may be the partition between us and the mo&s;t iminent danger? Who knows, but before the flight of another month, the &s;torm which now lowers in our horizon, may rapidly ri&s;e and involve us in de&s;truction? At a di&s;tance we hear the thunders roar, and &s;ee the lightnings play; who can tell how &s;oon they may fla&s;h acro&s;s our &s;ky, and enkindle all the fire of war? Then, then, when con&s;ternation walks through the land&mdash;when the loud alarm is &s;ounded&mdash; TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS! the foe is advan|cing thick and formidable&mdash;the banners of &s;lavery lower
<PB N="20" REF="027169_0020_0FD393192C0787B8">over his front. Your wives, your children, your venerable &s;ires&mdash;your rights as men&mdash;your glory as freemen, demand your &s;trenuous efforts&mdash;TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS, and meet the embattled foe!&mdash;When this &s;hall be our &s;ituation; in what &s;hall be our &s;afety, what &s;hall give us firmne&s;s, what &s;hall render us formidable&mdash;invincible&mdash; victorious, but the POWER of UNION? Breathe then, my fellow citizens, O breathe the &s;ame &s;pirit of freedom; vigorou&s;ly co-operate in the &s;ame honorable mea&s;ures; en|kindle the &s;ame ardent glow of patrioti&s;m, and let your &s;ouls burn with the noble&s;t emulation, in the &s;ervice of your country. Then if the impetuo&s;ity of war de&s;cend, you &s;hall receive the &s;hock like men, and return it like heroes. Ty|ranny &s;hall again fly before you, and liberty ride through the air in &s;ublime triumph.</P>
<P>BUT, happy Americans! Although you ought vigorou&s;ly to prepare for your defence; although the "war of freedom is better than the peace of &s;lavery;" yet remember that a nation involved in war is like a ve&s;&s;el in a &s;torm, &s;ome|times plunging into the deep, and &s;ometimes riding on the &s;ummit of the wave; but always in the mid&s;t of danger. Let our earne&s;t endeavours and our fervent prayers there|fore be, for the long continuance of the reign of PEACE. How &s;triking the contra&s;t between them! One is the breeze, which diffu&s;es health and plea&s;ure, and happine&s;s around&mdash;the other is the &s;torm, which &s;cowls beneath the face of heaven, and hurries with rapid de&s;truction over the earth. One, is the pure and gentle &s;tream, which &s;weetly murmurs as it flows in various channels, and marks all its cour&s;e with verdure, fertil|ity, and beauty&mdash;the other is the deluge which has bur&s;t every mound; roars direful as it rolls along; and &s;weeps away
<PB N="21" REF="027169_0021_0FD3931AADEBB8D8">flocks, and herds, and hou&s;es, and inhabitants, in the up|roar of confu&s;ion, to de&s;truction. The one, &s;urrounded with a &s;hining robe of flowing white, holding high her flouri&s;hing olive-branch, and &s;miling on man with the &s;weet|e&s;t benignity, &s;tands confe&s;t a fair inhabitant of heaven&mdash;the other, wrapt in a garb of &s;moke, and blood, and flames, looks round for objects of revenge, and darting fury from his dragon eye, proves his foul origin from the region of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>O my favored country! May the God of Peace, &s;till con|tinue to be thy friend; keep from thy &s;acred retreats and thy &s;hades of freedom, the demon of war, and di&s;tingui&s;h thee with the bright reign of happine&s;s and peace! Or if his PROVIDENCE &s;hall &s;uffer the ho&s;tile flame again to en|kindle around thee, may he, as in former days, di&s;play the power of his protecting arm, and crown thy efforts with victory, and thy name with glory!</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, &s;uffer me BROTHERS of the TAMMANY SOCIETY, as inclination and as duty prompt, to offer to you the &s;entiments of fraternal affection and regard. Within the walls of your wigwam, has my heart often ex|panded with genuine delight. There innocent plea&s;ure wanders free and unmole&s;ted, and &s;miles on every gue&s;t: There, friend&s;hip, founded on the pure&s;t motives, knits in the firm knot of UNION, the hearts of every true brother: There, the flame of patrioti&s;m, kindled by the tongue of eloquence, and the &s;weet voice of freedom, darts from &s;oul to &s;oul, and illuminates your peacefal hall. And there, if I have any love for my country, any ardor in the cau&s;e of liberty, any &s;trong de&s;ire for the happine&s;s of mankind, have
<PB N="22" REF="027169_0022_0FD3931DD6A33E08">the&s;e virtues been, both by precept and example, exalted and refined. May you long, very long be di&s;tingui&s;hed by every trait which can make you re&s;pected as men, and honor|ed as a &s;ociety. Let the principles of your in&s;titution be deeply engraven on your hearts, and be di&s;played in all your conduct. You will need no other defence again&s;t the attacks of calumny, no other qualification to en&s;ure the prai&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>BROTHERS, keep in mind that you are the UNION in miniature. Many are your fires, but they all burn with|in the &s;ame circle; many are your links, but they all con&s;titute one bright and &s;trong chain. Continually breathe upon your fires the breath of affection: This will not only pre|vent them from being extingui&s;hed, but will keep alive a a pure and gentle flame. E&s;pecially, guard again&s;t the de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ion, or the guileful art; that would break a&s;under the chain, which &s;o happily binds you together: Under their fatal influence, how &s;oon would its &s;trength depart, its links be covered with ru&s;t, and its beautiful poli&s;h vani&s;h away forever! May you, therefore, be con|vinced that your happine&s;s as a &s;ociety, like the glory of your country, depends upon the firmne&s;s, and can be &s;ecur|ed only by the &s;tability of UNION. And may time, as it flows equably along, find you continually &s;trengthening in the principles of Liberty, and progre&s;&s;ing in the light of Virtue, that you may at length &s;hine in the patriotic hemi&s;|phere, like a con&s;tellation of &s;uperior magnitude, with bright and permanent lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>BROTHERS, I know you love the fragrant Calumet of Peace, and delight in the happy lei&s;ure which tranquillity
<PB N="23" REF="027169_0023_0FD3936F4E815548">affords. I know you love to wander beneath the &s;hade of the wide &s;preading Oak, and to pluck the in|&s;piring clu&s;ter from the arms of the vine. But I know you al&s;o love FREEDOM, and will never re&s;ign her but in death. Shew your&s;elves, then, worthy of this cele&s;tial vi&s;itant, by obeying her laws, and defending her rights. Let not the "engines of tyranny ever extingui&s;h," nor all the floods of war drown the bright flame which burns in your brea&s;ts. But, when your country calls, di&s;play your principles by the UNION of your efforts, and by the energy of your action. See that your quivers be well &s;upplied with the keen-pointed arrow, and let the twang of your bows &s;ound dreadful. The warlike tomahawk, you have with plea&s;ure, "buried deep" beneath the floor of your wigwam; with heroi&s;m fly to "unbury it" and, rai&s;e it high for the &s;troke, "when your country's good requires it;" And &s;ee how many patriots yet remain, "who have been tried on the rough edge of battle when it raged;" who&s;e arm is yet &s;trong, and who&s;e &s;ouls yet glow for their country! See al&s;o the numerous bands of generous youths, who already breathe deliberate valor, and who burn to be led on to the conte&s;t of glory!</P>
<P>IF WAR &s;hall invade our territory, and we mu&s;t draw again the keenly tempered &s;word of freedom, let it be gra&s;p|ed by the &s;trong hand, and wielded with all the energy of the UNION. It &s;hall then &s;weep down whole ranks of &s;laves, and fla&s;hing rapidly over their ho&s;ts, throw them into terror and defeat. Our laws &s;hall flouri&s;h, our rights be never more invaded, and our glory endure while the &s;un rolls round the world, and the GREAT SPIRIT walks on the tops of the mountains. Freedom &s;o often victorious, &s;hall at length entirely demoli&s;h the throne of de&s;poti&s;m,
<PB N="24" REF="027169_0024_0FD39324D552D8D8">cau&s;e the thunders of war to be heard no more, and in&s;pire ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH with UNI|TED hearts, to rai&s;e the univer&s;al hymn to PEACE, to HAPPINESS and to LIBERTY.</P>
