<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I ADDRESS you with a mixture of plea&s;ure and embarra&s;&s;ment. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to participate the general &s;atisfaction which this anniver&s;ary affords; though a want of &s;ufficient lei&s;ure and opportunity has, I fear, prevented my coming forward prepared to &s;atisfy the expecta|tions of this re&s;pectable auditory, or ju&s;tify the partiality of tho&s;e who placed me here. But the fields of Science have lately been &s;o thoroughly explored, and the choice&s;t productions &s;o care|fully collected, that to expect a new and rich re|pa&s;t at this time, would be like looking for the bounties of Nature in fields where the harve&s;t had been gathered.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom with the Society which is here a&s;&s;embled, on the occa&s;ion of this anniver&s;ary, to delegate one or more of its members to deliver a public harangue. In di&s;charging this duty, the performer has the choice of his theme. It mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="031824_0004_0FEEBF3DF30CE0D0">be proper on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, when friends and &s;trangers out of the Society oblige us with their attendance, to unfold and di&s;cu&s;s the motives which led to this e&s;tabli&s;hment; the principles which have governed the members of it, in pro&s;|ecuting the de&s;ign; and the con&s;equences that may probably re&s;ult therefrom. As this has never yet been done, &s;o far as my knowledge extends, with your permi&s;&s;ion I will attempt it.</P>
<P>The form of this In&s;titution originated in a Si&s;ter Seminary to the South, and from thence was <HI>mediately</HI> communicated to this. It was not adopted here with an idea of attaching to its mem|bers &s;uperior privileges, or arrogating to them an invidious di&s;tinction. No expectations were formed that the connexion would afford a di&s;|pen&s;ation from any of the duties of &s;chola&s;tic life, or independently in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s in the world. But it was well under&s;tood that re&s;pectability here, and eminence and good fortune through life, were exclu&s;ively attached to ability, informa|tion and merit. To improve and increa&s;e the&s;e important qualities, give complete effect to the endeavors of our in&s;tructors, more fully accom|pli&s;h the purpo&s;es for which we were placed here by our friends, as well as to cultivate harmony and e&s;tabli&s;h a durable friend&s;hip, the plan of the In&s;titution was approved and carried into effect. Experience has confirmed theory; and the util|ity of the &s;cheme has equalled the expectations of its advocates.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031824_0005_0FEEBF40D2A3F130">
In its pro&s;ecution, objects of pur&s;uit and the modes of inve&s;tigation have been pointed out. The&s;e have been &s;uch as were either u&s;eful in them&s;elves, or as they tended to invigorate and extend the rea&s;oning faculty. A literary account|ability to the whole is naturally expected of each of the members; and hence re&s;ults, not only in|du&s;try, but a circum&s;pection of mind, an endeavor at cla&s;&s;ic purity and correctne&s;s, which might otherwi&s;e have been neglected. Free communi|cation on all proper &s;ubjects is encouraged; and accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of particular points enjoined. By this expedient, the &s;tock of information is im|proved, the ideas are afforted and arranged, and pedantry and he&s;itation give place to ea&s;e and ready re&s;ource. The &s;tudent who confines him|&s;elf to his clo&s;et, and collects his information wholly from the dead letter of his authors, with|out improving the faculty of communication or an interchange of &s;entiments and ob&s;ervations, may acquire much learning; but the ma&s;s will be of little more u&s;e to him than a trea&s;ure depo&s;it|ed under the ba&s;e of a pyramid.</P>
<P>As the Society was not exclu&s;ively connected with one &s;eminary, it was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent mi&s;takes and impo&s;itions, as well as for other pur|po&s;es, to pre&s;erve tho&s;e my&s;teries and <HI>arcana,</HI> which had been attached to it from its origin. Independent of the many precedents which exi&s;t in point, to which we might appeal for an apol|ogy, we tru&s;t that this con&s;ideration will afford to
<PB N="8" REF="031824_0006_0FEEBF43AC5EBFD8">the candid a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification. But a tree, it is &s;aid, is to be known by its fruit; and, as we have <HI>endeavored</HI> to approve our&s;elves to the world, we feel a mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance that our In&s;titu|tion will not &s;uffer by an application of the rule. Fifteen years have already elap&s;ed &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment here: During all which time, irreg|ularities of conduct, riot, tumult and di&s;order have uniformly been di&s;countenanced; and due &s;ubordination and a regard to order have been en|joined and practi&s;ed. Many advantages therefore have re&s;ulted to the Univer&s;ity, and perhaps to &s;ociety it&s;elf. From a conviction of the utility of the &s;cheme, on all the&s;e and various other ac|counts, the Government of this Seminary have, with great propriety, afforded their patronage and countenance to the In&s;titution.</P>
<P>Some of the general con&s;equences that may probably flow from this e&s;tabli&s;hment are obvious and apparent. The intere&s;ts of the community are undoubtedly advanced by the information and ability of its members. Nay, a general diffu&s;ion of knowledge and literature is thought e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of a free government. This benefit, however, does not fully re&s;ult to &s;o|ciety, unle&s;s the powers of the head are connected with goodne&s;s of heart. In what con&s;i&s;ts the dif|ference between a civilized man and a &s;avage? Certainly not more in the improvement of mind, than di&s;po&s;ition. Let one, therefore, be enlarged, without a proportional correction of the other,
<PB N="9" REF="031824_0007_0FEEBF4C1AD93310">and the man will be but a &s;avage &s;till, with greater ability to gratify his uncorrected propen&s;ities. Tho&s;e &s;ocieties, therefore, mu&s;t be importantly u&s;eful, which make a reciprocal friend&s;hip a part of their con&s;titutions. For, it is from the culti|vation of private attachments, that we learn to extend our affections to a general philanthropy. It is not to be denied, that &s;ome of the benefits which they would produce are happily &s;uper&s;eded by the tranquil &s;tate of our country, and the mild manners of a poli&s;hed and enlightened age. Such in&s;titutions, e&s;pecially if they become exten&s;ive, are admirably calculated to &s;often the manners, and ameliorate the condition of mankind, in bar|barous or tumultuous times.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;onic E&s;tabli&s;hment, which is of this de&s;cription, from its antiquity and univer&s;ality, furni&s;hes the be&s;t illu&s;tration of this doctrine. Avoiding all the chimerical, or at be&s;t, doubtful accounts of a very high antiquity; it is certain that their order exi&s;ted, and was held in re&s;pect, during the latter part of the dark ages. In addi|tion to the refinement of di&s;po&s;ition, which the cheri&s;hing the mild virtue of friend&s;hip always induces; hi&s;tory affords us many in&s;tances of the beneficial effects which that e&s;tabli&s;hment produ|ced. The exile, whom differences in religious opinions, revolutions in government, or the chances of war had driven from his country to a foreign land; in&s;tead of there finding him&s;elf friendle&s;s and alone, in&s;tead of being expo&s;ed to
<PB N="10" REF="031824_0008_0FEEBF4EE7790E88">the in&s;uits and abu&s;e of the unfeeling, or redu|ced to the &s;ad alternative of menial &s;ervice, or &s;oliciting a cold charity to obtain a pitiful &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence; no &s;ooner did he make known his con|nexion to any of the fraternity whom he might chance to meet, than he found the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip open to receive, the arm of power &s;tretched forth to protect, and the hand of a lib|eral charity unfolded to &s;upport him. The un|happy captive who had fallen into the hands of a ferocious and exa&s;perated enemy, in&s;tead of meet|ing that cruel death, or being condemned to the &s;till more cruel bondage which he expected, is di&s;covered by a brother of the order among the conquerors: Forthwith the fetters are &s;truck from his limbs, the balm of con&s;olation is copiou&s;ly ad|mini&s;tered, and he is relieved from his fearful ap|prehen&s;ions. This generous relief was not con|fined to Ma&s;onic Brethren, but often extended to their friends and fellow-&s;ufferers. How grateful is it to ob&s;erve &s;uch in&s;tances of humanity and benevolence, breaking forth in times of general barbari&s;m and depravity of manners! The gem of friend&s;hip &s;hines with a brighter, a diviner ray, in proportion to the general gloom of the times in which it is found.</P>
<P>Unacquainted with the &s;ecrets of Ma&s;onry, I &s;tate no other in&s;tance of analogy between that order and ours, but that of a fraternal attachment to each other. But certain I am that a cultiva|tion of the tender and &s;ocial affections, and the
<PB N="11" REF="031824_0009_0FEEBF5070208E80">con&s;equent exten&s;ion of our benevolence to a gen|eral philanthropy, is the mo&s;t important, the mo&s;t honorable principle that any fraternity can pro|fe&s;s. If ever this was a &s;ecret, thank God, it is now rapidly developing, or is already unfolded to &s;ociety at large.</P>
<P>Comparing the &s;tate of mankind with what it was &s;carce more than a century ago, how im|men&s;ely is it improved! In many countries, in|&s;tead of laws which authori&s;ed the governments to &s;eize the property of an unfortunate &s;tranger, who &s;hould die within their juri&s;diction, how|ever ju&s;t the claims of his relations or others might be; or to &s;trip from the wretches who were wrecked on their coa&s;ts, the remnant of their property which the rage of the elements had &s;pared; in&s;tead of the barbarous cu&s;tom of coolly murdering or condemning to &s;lavery the unhappy captives, whom the fortune of war, or even a vi|olation of the rights of ho&s;pitality had brought within their power; we find laws providing for the &s;upport of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of every de&s;cription; &s;ocieties e&s;tabli&s;hed and countenanced by govern|ment for the relief of the unfortunate. In times of peace, mo&s;t countries are open for the free ad|mi&s;&s;ion and departure of &s;trangers; and their equal right to protection and relief is acknowl|edged: And in time of war, excepting &s;ome partial in&s;tances of cruelty, which have unfortu|nately &s;tained the hi&s;tory of our own times; if any one fall into the hands of his enemy, the dan|ger
<PB N="12" REF="031824_0010_0FEEBF51F92FA600">of his life cea&s;es with his re&s;i&s;tance; he is treated with politene&s;s, and allowed all the conve|niencies and comforts of life. In a &s;hort time he is liberated on his &s;imple parole, or exchanged unhurt; or, on the conclu&s;ion of a peace, is di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed without a ran&s;om. Wars in general are no longer per&s;onal, but national: And though indi|viduale di&s;charge their duty with gallantry in the field; yet they have none of that private animo&s;|ity and rancor which formerly armed that de|&s;tructive evil with double terror.</P>
<P>In this picture, which is undoubtedly ju&s;t with re&s;pect to much the greater part of what is term|ed the civilized world, it mu&s;t be highly &s;atisfac|tory to ob&s;erve that our own country &s;tands in the foreground. Mildne&s;s and benevolence are ruling principles in all our governments: Philan|thropy is both honored and practi&s;ed by the great body of our citizens. The poor are pro|vided for by &s;tanding laws; and the unfortunate often relieved by particular acts of munificence. Individuals al&s;o have uniformly di&s;covered alac|rity and zeal to avert the dangers with which oth|ers were threatened, and have liberally contributed to repair unmerited misfortunes. Societies have been formed for the kind reception and friendly treatment of &s;uch foreigners as &s;eek an a&s;ylum in our happy country; others, to re&s;tore per&s;ons apparently dead to life and the embraces of their anxious friends. Many &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hments do honor to our country. When engaged in war,
<PB N="13" REF="031824_0011_0FEE929B1380A148">no American was ever known to take the life of the unre&s;i&s;ting or unarmed; and the kindne&s;s and humanity with which our magnanimous armies, though often exa&s;perated by cruelties which had been practi&s;ed on their countrymen, always treat|ed their pri&s;oners, extorted prai&s;es from their ene|mies them&s;elves. What other people can exhibit an example of a complete revolution achieved, both in the form and the admini&s;tration of gov|ernment, or of rebellions effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, where no blood has been &s;pilled on account of the opinion of individuals, or the &s;ide of the contro|ver&s;y merely, which they e&s;pou&s;ed? Far hence be the time, when either foreign war or internal commotion &s;hall again call for the exerci&s;e of the&s;e magnanimous virtues; but &s;till let us cher|i&s;h, and be ready to put them in practice, if the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould ever re-exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Though humanity and benevolence be ju&s;tly a part of our national character; yet, as other na|tions are behind us, &s;o we have not arrived at per|fection. There &s;till remains a wide field for the exerci&s;e of a generous ambition. To revi&s;e, and mitigate in many ca&s;es, our codes of criminal law, by endeavoring to make a reformation of the of|fender, in&s;tead of his extirpation, the object of puni&s;hment; to transform our common places of confinement from &s;eminaries of wickedne&s;s and villany into &s;chools of morality; to liberate the unhappy Africans from the horrors of a &s;la|very equally unju&s;t and inhuman; to promote
<PB N="14" REF="031824_0012_0FEEBF5BB7D28AE8">an interchange of good offices, and a mild and pacific di&s;po&s;ition among mankind; objects like the&s;e are worthy the pur&s;uit of the noble&s;t minds. Some of them have already immortalized the names of PENN, HOWARD, and WILBERFORCE. Shall we be deterred, &s;hall we &s;hrink in de&s;pair from objects of &s;uch magnitude? Is it chimerical to indulge a hope that even we may bear a con|&s;picuous part in this noble pur&s;uit? No; remem|bering that, in &s;uch a cau&s;e, it is much more hon|orable to lead than to follow; we will lend our individual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as circum&s;tances may permit, and endeavor to give a tone to the public opin|ion. If one man, by his per&s;onal exertion, could alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of thou&s;ands, &s;cattered through all the countries of Europe, nay, could gladden even the horrors of the Ea&s;t; what may not numbers achieve? It is true we are yet com|paratively few: But our number, both here and el&s;ewhere, is continually increa&s;ing. Our In&s;ti|tution is now confined to a few &s;eminaries in this country: But what ob&s;tacle exi&s;ts to its fur|ther exten&s;ion? or even to a communication of it to foreign univer&s;ities? in many of which, e&s;tabli&s;hments of this kind have heretofore found a cordial &s;upport. Let us remember al&s;o, that in the practice of philanthropy, which is far from being the lea&s;t important object of our a&s;&s;ociation, we &s;hall act in concert with many other re&s;pecta|ble in&s;titutions, and meet the concurrence of a generous public. With due exertion, therefore,
<PB N="15" REF="031824_0013_0FEEBF5D4E8744D0">even of a few, in various places and different walks of life, the great current of opinion may be directed into proper channels, and its raraifica|tions reach every object of compa&s;&s;ion. When the beneficial effects of a general &s;pirit of human|ity &s;hall be ob&s;erved here, it will readily be adopted abroad. Our country has already taught the world the true &s;cience of government, and the art to be free. She exhibits the example of a great people flouri&s;hing and happy, among whom, to the &s;urpri&s;e of other nations, gradations in rank, and exclu&s;ive rights, are entirely unknown. Why then &s;hall we not in&s;truct the &s;pecies in the arts of humanity, and the &s;cience of univer&s;al friend&s;hip? Is this general diffu&s;ion of philan|thropy mere chimera and extravagance? If it be, I could almo&s;t wi&s;h that we might &s;till cheri&s;h the delu&s;ion. For what but the reality could be more grateful to benevolent minds, than a con|fident anticipation that the whole world would become a common country to each individual; that mankind would be but one family, by practice, as well as extraction; and thereby ta&s;te on Earth, the joys of Heaven it&s;elf?</P>
