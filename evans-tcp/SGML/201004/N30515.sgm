<P>Moreover, when ye fa&s;t, be not as the Hypocrites, of a &s;ad Coun|tenance: For they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fa&s;t. Verily I &s;ay unto you, they have their Reward. But thou when thou fa&s;te&s;t, anoint thine Head, and wa&s;h thy Face.

<P>_OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord having in the for|mer Chapter, arm'd his Di&s;ciples a|gain&s;t the corrupt Principles of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> e&s;pecially in their Expo&s;ition of the Law, which is el&s;e|where call'd their Leaven; proceeds in this to warn them again&s;t their corrupt Practices; particularly their Hypocri&s;y and vain Glory in giving Alms, in Prayer, and in Fa&s;ting: The&s;e, &s;ay the <HI>Arabians,</HI> are the three great Chri&s;tian Duties, the three Foundations of the Law, by them we do Homage to GOD with our three principal Intere&s;ts; by Prayer, with our Souls; by Alms-giving, with our E&s;tates; and by Fa&s;ting, with our Bodies: It is the la&s;t of the&s;e that our Lord treats of, in the Words of our Text; which indeed, when duly ob&s;erved, is attended with the other two. The ble&s;|&s;ed JESUS offers the &s;ame Caution to his Di&s;ciples, in the Cele|bration of every of them, <HI>e. g. When thou doe&s;t thine Alms,</HI> (&s;ay|eth he, that is in &s;ecret) <HI>do not &s;ound a Trumpet before thee,</HI> avoid all O&s;tentation, <HI>let not thy Left Hand know, what thy Right Hand doeth, that thy Alms may be in &s;ecret, and thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret will reward thee openly.</HI> Not that it is unlawful to di&s;|pen&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="040518_0006_1015E8E31903EE40">
Charity in the Sight of others, when thereto call'd by di|vine Providence: No! But only for that End that we may be &s;een by them. The Thing forbidden under the&s;e metaphorical Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, is O&s;tentation, and &s;eeking our own Honour and Ap|plau&s;e; and the Thing commanded is Sincerity in regard of our End: Tho' the Action of Charity be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily pub|lick, yet the End &s;hould be always &s;ecret: Tho&s;e that give their Alms for O&s;tentation-&s;ake, have their Reward; not the Reward that GOD promi&s;eth to them that do Good: No! But the Re|ward they promi&s;ed them&s;elves, and a poor Reward it is; they did it to be &s;een of Men, and they are &s;een of Men, and applauded by them, and this is all their Reward: They have it in pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and nothing remaining in rever&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e that are &s;incere and humble in Alms-giving, are not only graciou&s;ly accepted in this Life, but will be openly rewarded by GOD him&s;elf in the Life to come; <HI>thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, he him&s;elf &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P>IN like Manner our Lord cautions his Di&s;ciples again&s;t the &s;ame Evils, namely, Hypocri&s;y and O&s;tentation in &s;ecret Prayer; which were too frequent and flagrant among the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHEN thou praye&s;t, thou &s;halt not be as the Hypocrites are, for they love to pray &s;tanding in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be &s;een of Men, verily, I &s;ay unto you they have their Reward.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> affected the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Po&s;ture, and mo&s;t publick Places for their private Devotion, with De&s;ign to be com|mended for their Eminence in Religion, and this was all the Be|nefit they obtained by it.</P>
<P>ALTHO' their &s;tated U&s;e of publick Places for private Wor|&s;hip without Nece&s;&s;ity, was improper and unju&s;tifiable; yet it was their evil De&s;ign herein that our Lord principally reprehends.</P>
<P>BUT as to the Po&s;ture of &s;tanding in Prayer, it was certainly lawful, proper, and u&s;ual in publick Wor&s;hip, (<HI>Matt.</HI> xi. 25. <HI>Luke</HI> xviii 11.) <HI>When ye &s;tand praying, forgive,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, and therefore it was their ambitious corrupt View herein, that our Saviour oppo&s;es, and on the contrary, councils his Di&s;ciples, to choo&s;e for their &s;ecret Devotion, &s;ome Place of Retirement and Privacy, that being unob&s;erved and undi&s;turbed, it might be effectually &s;e|cured, both from O&s;tentation and Di&s;traction; and be plea&s;ing to that GOD who principally requires the Heart, and penetrates its mo&s;t concealed De&s;igns, and will in due Time graciou&s;ly and honourably reward &s;uch as are &s;incere.</P>
<P>THE very &s;ame Language does our Lord u&s;e, the &s;ame Councils and Cautions does he give, re&s;pecting the Duty of <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> in the Words of our Text; which have a plain Reference to the afore|&s;aid In&s;tances of Alms-giving and Prayer; as appears not only from the &s;ame Forms of Expre&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame order of Di&s;cour&s;e u&s;ed therein, as well as the &s;ame Per&s;ons &s;poken of, and to; but likewi&s;e from the introductive Particle or fir&s;t Word of our
<PB N="7" REF="040518_0007_1015E8E4B59F3410">
Text, <HI>Moreover,</HI> which manife&s;tly &s;hews its Relation to the pre|ceeding In&s;tances; it is as if our Lord had &s;aid, be&s;ides what I have &s;poken to you upon Alms-giving and Prayer, <HI>Take the&s;e Directions which are of the &s;ame Kind, in Relation to the Duty of</HI> Fa&s;ting. <HI>Moreover, when ye fa&s;t, be not as the Hypocrites are of a &s;ad Countenance,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW in the Words of our Text, three Things are ob&s;ervable, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> recommended, the <HI>Manner</HI> of it pre|&s;cribed, and the <HI>Reward</HI> inciting hereto propo&s;ed, and pro|mi&s;ed. And</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Duty</HI> of religious <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> is recommended or enjoined upon proper Occa&s;ions, <HI>i. e.</HI> when GOD by his Providence calls to it, or the Ca&s;e of our own Souls upon any Account requires it.</P>
<P>OUR Lords pre&s;cribing the <HI>Manner</HI> of ob&s;erving it, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Expediency, and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing it&s;elf, yea, the Pre&s;cription, or Injunction of that, to which the Mode relates; otherwi&s;e our Lord mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s to direct how his Di&s;ciples &s;hould do <HI>nothing;</HI> which is ab&s;urd! Or that which is wor&s;e than nothing, namely, what is &s;inful!</P>
<P>TO &s;uppo&s;e that the Mode or accidents of Things, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the Sub&s;tance, is to run into the wild Delu&s;ion of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> about <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> which equally oppo&s;es the Prin|ciples of &s;ober Rea&s;on, and evidence of common Sen&s;e!</P>
<P>AND to &s;uppo&s;e that our Lord would direct to the Manner of performing any Thing that is Evil, is in other Words to &s;ay, that he approves of it; which is as impious as the other is irrational!</P>
<P>BESIDES <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> is recommended, in the &s;ame Manner as <HI>Alm&s;giving</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and therefore he that oppo&s;es the former, may with equal rea&s;on oppo&s;e the latter, and if &s;o, Religion is &s;tripped of its principal Parts, namely, Piety towards GOD, and Charity towards Men, and con&s;equently de&s;troyed!</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Piety</HI> towards GOD can a Man be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to have, who does not pray to him? Will &s;uch fear him, love him, and depend upon him, who pay him no Homage, return him no Thanks for Benefits receiv'd, nor own their Dependance on his Providence? And can there be real Piety without the&s;e? No, &s;urely!</P>
<P>AND have &s;uch <HI>Charity</HI> towards Men, who, when their Ability admits, and Occa&s;ion requires, cu&s;tomarily refu&s;e to di&s;pen&s;e their Benificence to the proper Objects of it? In a Word, by this Method Religion is made as oppo&s;ite to GOD, as unfriendly to Society!</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> is pre&s;cribed in our Text, and that both <HI>negatively,</HI> and <HI>po&s;itively:</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NEGATIVELY,</HI> Our Lord councils his Di&s;ciples, <HI>when they fa&s;t, not to be as the Hypocrites, of a &s;ad Countenance, for they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fa&s;t.</HI> We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that our Lord here, prohibits &s;uch a Garb and Ge&s;ture, as is &s;uited to a Day of publick Fa&s;ting; for GOD
<PB N="8" REF="040518_0008_1015E8E6A3B92C10">
him&s;elf &s;ometimes commanded the <HI>Jews</HI> to put off their Orna|ments: Nor was any thing more common among Good Men, than to cloath them&s;elves with Sackcloth, and put A&s;hes on their Head, or &s;pread them under them, upon &s;uch &s;olemn Occa&s;ions; but what CHRIST prohibits, is their affecting tho&s;e Things for &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ordid Purpo&s;es, while in the mean Time they wanted what was &s;ignified by them.</P>
<P>AND their making no difference between a private and publick Fa&s;t. As our Lord had &s;poken before of private Alms-giving, and private Prayer, &s;o he here &s;peaks (at lea&s;t principally) of a <HI>private Fa&s;t,</HI> as appears from the&s;e Words, <HI>that ye appear not unto Men to fa&s;t, but to your Father who &s;eeth in &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is by no Means applicable to a <HI>publick Fa&s;t,</HI> for then do Per&s;ons appear to Men with whom they have &s;ocial Wor&s;hip to fa&s;t; the De&s;ign is known, the Bu&s;ine&s;s is no &s;ecret: Yea, and as it is their Duty to be deeply affected on &s;uch a &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, &s;o to appear in re&s;pect of Garb and Behaviour &s;uitable to it! In private Fa&s;ts indeed the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, it is then no doubt ne|ce&s;&s;ary to conceal from others ob&s;ervance, as much as we can, our private Exerci&s;es, and Humiliations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> whom our LORD frequently calls <HI>Hypocrits,</HI> pre|tended <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> when they were de&s;titute of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and Con|trition, which are the Soul and Kernel of that Duty. They affected to appear more Humbled than they really were, and &s;o mock'd GOD, and deceived Men, by their feign'd Pretences: This the Almighty ju&s;tly re&s;ents in the Prophe&s;y of I&s;aiah, <HI>is it &s;uch a Fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en, a Man to afflict his Soul, is it to bow down his Head as a Bulru&s;h, and to &s;pread Sackcloth and A&s;hes under him, wilt thou call this a Fa&s;t, an acceptable Day to the Lord?</HI> No! Bodily exerci&s;e, if that be all, will profit little.</P>
<P>BESIDES the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> proclaim'd and blaz'd abroad their private <HI>Fa&s;ts;</HI> as they did their private <HI>Charities,</HI> and private <HI>Prayers;</HI> and &s;o manag'd the Matter in re&s;pect of their appearance and ge&s;ture as to declare to every one whom they met with, that it was a Day of Fa&s;ting with them; to this purpo&s;e they ap|pear'd in the Streets, when they &s;hould have been in their private Rooms, and were clad in a poor Habit, affected a Melancholy A&s;pect, and went a &s;low Pace, on Purpo&s;e to attract the atten|tion of others, and invite their Applau&s;e, that they might pa&s;s for &s;trict and mortify'd Men.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> received their Name from hence as <HI>Grotius</HI> ob|&s;erves, that they were not contented to fulfill the Rites enjoyn'd by the Law, but were di&s;tingui&s;h'd from others, by &s;everer In&s;ti|tutions of their own invention: And therefore they <HI>disfigur'd their Faces</HI> on <HI>Fa&s;t Days.</HI></P>

But,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Po&s;itively,</HI> CHRIST teaches us, how to Conduct a pri|vate Fa&s;t, <HI>But thou when thou Fa&s;teth anoint thy Head, and wa&s;h thy Face, that thou appear not to Men to Fa&s;t, but to thy Father which is in &s;ecret. i. e.</HI> Lay a&s;ide all &s;hew and appearance of Fa&s;ting, appear with thy ordinary A&s;pect and Dre&s;s, and whil&s;t thou ab&s;taine&s;t from Bodily refre&s;hments, Endeavour to carry &s;o that it mayn't be taken Notice of, conceal it as much as you can. rather &s;hew the appearance of Gladne&s;s then of Grief.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time ob&s;erve, that CHRIST doth not direct to abate any Thing of the reality of the Fa&s;t, not to take a little Meat, or a little Drink, or any Bodily Refre&s;hment what&s;oever, No! But to lay a&s;ide the Shew of it, and make the inward Part of it our principal Care, namely to be Humble and Sincere before GOD, in ob&s;erving this Solemnity, and to endeavour to approve our&s;elves to him To all &s;uch,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. There is a <HI>reward</HI> propos'd and promis'd, <HI>their Father that &s;eeth in Secret will Reward them openly, i. e.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed GOD who is the Heavenly Father of all true Chri&s;tians, who beholds with delight their &s;incere, humbling and mortifying Ex|erci&s;es in Secret, in their Days of Fa&s;ting, will reward them gra|ciou&s;ly and honourably at the General Judgment: So that <HI>fa&s;t|ing</HI> hath its <HI>Reward,</HI> not con&s;idered &s;eparately, but as an In&s;tance of our Obedience to a divine In&s;titution, and as it &s;erves to pro|mote the Power of real Godline&s;s, which hath the Promi&s;e of this Life and that which is to come.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;ideration of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d's favourable acceptance of our <HI>Fa&s;ts,</HI> &s;hould make us dead to the Hopes of Mens applau&s;e, as well as to the Fears of their cen&s;ures. King <HI>David</HI> would not decline the Duty of <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> tho' <HI>it was turn'd,</HI> by the Enemies of Religion, <HI>to his Reproach.</HI></P>
<P>IF it be objected, that &s;eeing CHRIST &s;peaks of a <HI>private Fa&s;t</HI> in our Text, one of a <HI>publick nature</HI> cannot be thereby prov'd.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is a Mi&s;take, CHRIST approves of ab&s;tinence, which is the Genus or Kind, that includes all the Species or dif|ferent Sorts of it. Moreover, an Argument from the greater, is conclu&s;ive and certain. Seeing CHRIST approves of the Duty of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> in private, when the Cau&s;es are le&s;&s;er and private; he mu&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="040518_0010_1015E8ED59D44248">
needs approve of publick <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> when the Cau&s;es are greater and more important, when it is ob&s;erved humbly and &s;incerely, with a &s;ecret Intention; or el&s;e be very unrea&s;onable, in preferring a private Good to a publick.</P>
<P>SEEING GOD has given us Bodies as well as Souls, is it but ju&s;t and rational, that he &s;hould be &s;erved by both, not only in private but in publick?</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that <HI>Reformation</HI> is &s;ufficient without outward <HI>ab|&s;tinence</HI> I An&s;wer, this will conclude as much again&s;t <HI>Alms-giv|ing</HI> and <HI>Prayer:</HI> For, by a parity of Rea&s;on, we may &s;ay, it is enough to pray in our Hearts, and thus all vocal Prayer is de|&s;troy'd; and likewi&s;e that it is enough to give Alms in our Hearts, and thus all Charity is de&s;troy'd! In a Word, the afore&s;aid Ob|jection tends to overthrow, in its Con&s;equences, all the outward Offices of Religion and Friend&s;hip at a Stroke, and therefore cannot be true!</P>
<P>FROM the Words of our Text thus explained, I would ob&s;erve the following Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz. That Religious Fa&s;ting is a Duty of Divine In&s;titution, and great Advantage to Mankind, and there|fore &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd with Care and Caution.</HI></P>
<P>IN Di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Propo&s;ition, I would according to the Order of our Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. Prove the <HI>Divine In&s;titution</HI> of Religious Fa&s;ting.</P>
<P N="2">II. Open the <HI>Mode</HI> of its Ob&s;ervance</P>
<P N="3">III. Repre&s;ent its <HI>Advantages</HI> and <HI>Importance;</HI> and then proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P>Here it &s;hould be previou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd that I made mention of <HI>Re|ligious Fa&s;ting,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Medicinal;</HI> the former of which is pre&s;crib'd by the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> for a Civil Pur|po&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;aving of Provi&s;ion; the latter is u&s;ed for the preventing of <HI>Sickne&s;s&punc;</HI> or recovery of <HI>Health.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>Religious Fa&s;ting</HI> is undertaken, on the Account of Re|ligion; with de&s;ign to a&s;&s;i&s;t the performance of the Duties o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, and may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is an In&s;tance of divine <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> pre&s;crib'd by God, to illu&s;trate his Glory, and promote the Good of Mankind.

<P>THAT it is a Solemn voluntary <HI>ab&s;tinence,</HI> from Food, Drink, and all the Plea&s;ures of Life, for a certain &s;pace of Time, which is &s;et apart to be &s;pent in Prayer and Humiliation.</P>
<P>OR if the Con&s;titution be &s;o weak, as not to be able to endure a total ab&s;tinence without prejudice to Health; yet they &s;hould ab&s;tain as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with it, which may be called a <HI>Fa&s;t;</HI> but it is a total ab&s;tinence that properly Claims that Character.</P>

Men; by which the Almighty calls to the Duty of <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> and points to a &s;uitable Sea&s;on for the Performance of it.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the divine Judgments, that urge its Ob&s;ervation, may &s;aid to be fourfold. <HI>viz</HI> either <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> when the Judgments of God affect a particular Per&s;on only, and call him to a &s;ecret Ob&s;ervation of this Duty by him&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>OR <HI>Dome&s;tick,</HI> when extraordinary Calamities do affect and di&s;tre&s;s a particular Family, who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ereby invited to ob&s;erve a private Fa&s;t by them&s;elves, in a &s;ocial Manner.</P>
<P>OR <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> when divine Judgments are inflicted, or threat|ned to be inflicted, upon a certain particular Church or Society, and they are hereby induc'd to ob&s;erve religious ab&s;tinence.</P>

<P>THIS Duty of <HI>religious fa&s;ting,</HI> under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;eems to be <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> only</P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> hereof are the&s;e following, viz. <HI>extraordi|nary Sins</HI> committed by our&s;elves or others. In the Time of <HI>Ezra</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> there were <HI>publick fa&s;ts</HI> for the &s;inful Mar|riages of the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with Infidel and Idolatrous Na|tions.</P>
<P>FARTHER, another Occa&s;ion hereof, is either <HI>Judgments</HI> in|flicted, or threatned to be inflicted. When the <HI>Famine</HI> rag'd a|mong the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in the Time of the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> God commanded them by him, <HI>to &s;anctify a fa&s;t, to call a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly, to gather the Elders and all the Inhabitants of the Land into the Hou&s;e of the Lord their God, and to cry unto the Lord: The Prie&s;ts, the Mini&s;ters of the Lord, were</HI> on that Occa&s;ion <HI>to weep between the Porch and the Altar, and &s;ay &s;pare thy People O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to Reproach; then,</HI> &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>will God be jealous for his Land, and pitty his People.</HI></P>
<P>AND when the pious <HI>Prince Jeho&s;aphat,</HI> heard of the de&s;ign of <HI>Ammon</HI> and <HI>Moab</HI> to invade <HI>Judah, he fear'd, and &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord, and proclaim'd a Fa&s;t throughout all Judah; and Judah gathered them&s;elves together to ask help of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER it is proper to <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> either when we engage in any <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>important Undertaking,</HI> or want <HI>Victory</HI> over &s;ome perilous and violent <HI>Temptation,</HI> that we may obtain Succe&s;s in the former, and Deliverance from the latter; thus when Queen <HI>E&s;ther</HI> was to intercede before the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarch, for her Na|tion, who were in the utmo&s;t Danger of utter ruin, as well as her&s;elf in the Attempt to re&s;cue them from it, &s;he ordered the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Shu&s;han</HI> to <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> which &s;he and her Maidens likewi&s;e ob|&s;erved; and indeed before this Order, the <HI>Hebrews</HI> in all the Pro|vinces of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> who had heard of the King's bloody Decree, <HI>mourned,</HI> and <HI>fa&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>wept</HI> of their own accord; and <HI>many lay in Sackcloth and A&s;hes!</HI></P>
<P>AND in regard of violent <HI>Temptations,</HI> methinks what our Lord
<PB N="12" REF="040518_0012_1015E8F0B1931DC8">
&s;ayeth of bodily Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that <HI>that Kind goeth not out but by Fa&s;ting and Prayer,</HI> is ea&s;ily applicable to them.</P>
<P>THE Exerci&s;e of religious <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> both private and publick, is commended to our E&s;teem and Ob&s;ervance, both in the Writings of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Nehemiah heard,</HI> that the <HI>Remnant of the Captivity were in great Affliction and Reproach; and that the Wall of Jeru&s;alem was broken down, and the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es burnt with Fire,</HI> he kept a private <HI>Fa&s;t, he mourned certain Days,</HI> and <HI>fa&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>prayed before the God of Heaven,</HI> (Nehemiah i. 4.)</P>
<P>WHEN King <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Child</HI> was &s;truck with <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> after the Prophet's Threatnings, he <HI>fa&s;ted, lay all Night on the Earth, and be&s;ought God for the Child,</HI> (2 Sam. xii.)</P>
<P>WHEN the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> under&s;tood from the Writings of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> that the Space of 70 Years would put a Period to the De&s;olations of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and that the Time was drawing nigh, <HI>he &s;et his Face to &s;eek the Lord</HI> for that Mercy <HI>with Prayer and Fa&s;ting,</HI> (Dan. iii.) and el&s;ewhere we are informed, that <HI>Daniel was mourning three full Weeks, and eat no plea&s;ant Bread, neither came Fle&s;h or Wine into his Mouth,</HI> (Dan. x.)</P>
<P>IN the twelfth Chapter of the Prophe&s;y of <HI>Zecharias,</HI> we have a Prediction of the State of the Go&s;pel-Church, repre&s;enting that then the <HI>Spirit &s;hould be poured forth,</HI> and in Con&s;equence thereof, that there &s;hould be not only a great and general <HI>Mourning</HI> for Sin in publick A&s;&s;emblies, but likewi&s;e particular in private Families; <HI>every Family mourning apart, and their Wives apart.</HI></P>
<P>NOW fora&s;much as our Lord repre&s;ents religious Mourning, and Fa&s;ting as Terms of the &s;ame import, (<HI>Matt.</HI> ix. 15) the afore&s;aid Prophe&s;y is therefore an Argument of the divine Original, and con&s;tant Obligation of the Duty of <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> both per&s;onal, do|me&s;tick and publick: Tho&s;e therefore who profe&s;s them&s;elves Par|takers of the promi&s;ed Effu&s;ion of the Spirit of Grace and Suppli|cation; would do well to prove the reality of their Claim by a con&s;ciencious Compliance therewith.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> a Day of publick Fa&s;ting was proclaimed by the Order of GOD, that they might pre&s;ent their Supplications before the Lord, and every one return from his evil Way, and that in Con&s;equence hereof the Execution of divine Vengeance might be prevented, (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxxvi. 6, 7)</P>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Zecharias</HI> makes mention of a publick anniver|&s;ary Fa&s;t of divine Approbation, in the &s;eventh Capter of his Book the 4th and 5th Ver&s;es, which the Almighty complains they did not &s;incerely ob&s;erve; <HI>when ye fa&s;ted and mourned in the fifth and &s;eventh Month, did ye at all fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Day of Attonement in the &s;eventh Month, was by God's Ap|pointment, to be kept annually as a religious Fa&s;t; in that Day they were to afflict their Souls, and do no Manner of Work yea, the Per&s;ons that did not ob&s;erve this Order, were to be put to Death. See <HI>Levite</HI> xxiii. 26&mdash;32.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="040518_0013_1015E8F29DFBFAC8"><HI>NEHEMIAH,</HI> the pious, zealous, and faithful GOVERNOR of the <HI>Jews,</HI> a Gentleman of a brave and publick Spirit, who had very much at Heart the Good of that People, and was di&s;tre&s;s'd for their Impiety! ordered a religious Fa&s;t, on account of the prevailing Iniquity of the Times; and was the fir&s;t that &s;igned and &s;ealed the Covenant entered into upon that Occa&s;ion, to &s;erve GOD, and avoid <HI>profaning his Sabaoth!</HI> (An Evil which lamentably prevails in this and the neighbouring Provinces, at pre&s;ent!

<P>WHEN <HI>David</HI> and his Army, heard the News of the Defeat of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by the Troops of <HI>Amaleck, they rent their Garments, mourned,</HI> and <HI>wept,</HI> and <HI>fa&s;ted until the Even,</HI> (2 Sam. i. 12.)</P>
<P>NOR is the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> without In&s;tances of <HI>Fa&s;ting.</HI> The forerunner of CHRIST, <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> was a Man of &s;ingular Ab&s;tinence, he came <HI>neither eating Bread, nor drinking Wine,</HI> (Luke vii 33.) He was &s;o ab&s;temious, &s;aith <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> that his whole Life was but one continued <HI>Fa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord before he entered upon his publick Mini&s;try, pre|pared him&s;elf by <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> (Matt. iv.) and after his Entrance into it, &s;ometimes omitted to eat his Bread, and often continued long in lonely Retirement, which was doubtle&s;s attended with <HI>Ab&s;tinence:</HI> And what he practis'd him&s;elf he recommended to others in the Words of our Text, which I have before con&s;idered</P>
<P><HI>ANNA,</HI> the Prophete&s;s, likewi&s;e &s;erved GOD with Fa&s;ting and Prayer, (<HI>Luke</HI> ii. 37.) And the devout <HI>Cornelius</HI> ob&s;erved the &s;ame Practice, (<HI>Acts</HI> x. 30.)</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 7 chap. and 5. ver. &s;ignifies, that <HI>married Per&s;ons</HI> &s;hould at Times <HI>give them&s;elves to Fa&s;ting and Prayer,</HI> and el&s;ewhere farther ob&s;erves, that he had <HI>approved him&s;elf the Mini&s;ter of GOD in Labours, Watchings,</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;tings,</HI> (2 Cor. vi. 5.) By the whole&s;ome Di&s;ci|pline of religious <HI>fa&s;ting, he kept his Body under,</HI> and brought it into Subjection to the Government of the Mind, as he him&s;elf el&s;ewhere informs us, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 27)</P>
<P>THE <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of <HI>John fa&s;ted often,</HI> (Luke v. 33.) This proba|bly intends their Performance of the Duty in a united &s;ocial Way, as an A&s;&s;embly, &s;eeing they were wont to pray together at &s;tated Times, and had Directions from their Ma&s;ter to this Purpo&s;e, (<HI>Luke</HI> xi. 1.) And afterwards the Chri&s;tian Churches, often met for this End: Thus when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were ordained, and to be &s;ent to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Church appointed a Fa&s;t, to obtain the divine Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, (<HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 3.) So likewi&s;e when they ordained Elders in every Church they prayed with fa&s;ting, (<HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23.)</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Elders,</HI> are el&s;ewhere enjoined to <HI>feed the Flock of GOD, exerci&s;ing the Office of a Bi&s;hop over it,</HI> (1 Pet. v. 1.2) for &s;o the original Word <HI>Epi&s;copuntes,</HI> &s;hould be tran&s;lated: Hence you
<PB N="14" REF="040518_0014_1015E8F5E5BE5E68">
may &s;ee that in the Apo&s;tle's Times, every little Flock as the origi|nal Word <HI>(Poimnion)</HI> &s;ignifies, had either one or two <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to take the pa&s;toral Care over it; in tho&s;e primitive Times, the <HI>Bi|&s;hop</HI>'s <HI>Dioce&s;e</HI> was but &s;mall, for no more but one Society or Flock, and that generally a &s;mall one, fell to the Share of one or two of them. But to proceed,</P>
<P>THESE Words of our Saviour, (<HI>Mark</HI> ii. 15.) <HI>then &s;hall they fa&s;t in tho&s;e Days,</HI> are not only a <HI>Prediction</HI> of what his Di&s;ciples after his Departure from them &s;hould do, but a <HI>Precept</HI> obliging them thereto.</P>
<P>MOREOVER an Injunction to <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> as well as to <HI>pray,</HI> is in|cluded in the&s;e Words of CHRIST (Matt. xvii. 21.) <HI>This Kind goeth not out but by Prayer and Fa&s;ting,</HI> for this &s;hews that in our Saviours Time, it was us'd with his Approbation upon important Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT is true we meet with no Example of national Fa&s;ts, in the <HI>New-Te&s;tament;</HI> nor can this be rea&s;onably expected, becau&s;e the Chri&s;tian Religion was not national in the apo&s;tolick Times.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY the Appointment of publick Fa&s;ts at proper Sea|&s;ons is rational, for hereby it is made the joint Act of Churches, and States, and Humiliation under the mighty Hand of GOD the better promoted.</P>
<P>THIS the <HI>ancient Churches</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of, and therefore ap|pointed particular Days of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> on Occa&s;ion of publick Cala|mities, &s;uch as <HI>Pe&s;tilence, Per&s;ecution, War,</HI> &amp;c. as <HI>Tertullian, Cy|prian, Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> a&s;&s;ure us. Yea, many of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were directed by the Light of Nature or <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> only, to this Duty, witne&s;s the <HI>Ninevites, (Jona.</HI> iii.) the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> likewi&s;e, u&s;ed &s;ome kind of Ab&s;tinence, from &s;ome &s;ort of Food in Honour of their Gods, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> in|forms us. <HI>Hierocles</HI> and <HI>Purphery</HI> ob&s;erve of the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Phi|lo&s;ophers, that they us'd Ab&s;tinence to purge the Soul from the Di&s;orders of Sen&s;uality, and to advance internal Goodne&s;s; to which valuable Purpo&s;es, by the meer una&s;&s;i&s;ted Dint of human Rea&s;on, they ju&s;tly apprehended it had an excellent Tendency! In a Word, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> te&s;tifies, that Ab&s;tinence from &s;ome Sort of Food generally prevailed in the <HI>Pagan</HI> World.</P>
<P>IF it be objected, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf excu&s;es his Di&s;ciple's O|mi&s;&s;ion of the Duty of Fa&s;ting:</P>
<P>I an&s;wer it is true, but in &s;uch a Manner, as &s;hews his Appro|bation of the Ob&s;ervance of it, in proper Sea&s;ons: This will ap|pear by con&s;idering the Nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Apology, which is to the following Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e were <HI>early Days</HI> with them, and that therefore fa&s;ting was not then &s;o &s;ea&s;onable as it would be afterwards, nor were they &s;o able to endure the Severity of it; <HI>every Thing is beautiful in its Sea&s;on,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> truly ob&s;erves, and indeed then only!</P>
<P>THOSE that enter into the Marriage Relation, mu&s;t expect both Care and Trouble in the Fle&s;h; yet during the Nuptial Solemnity,
<PB N="15" REF="040518_0015_1015E8F868606D00">
they are cheerful, and it is but decent they &s;hould be &s;o. Now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, were but newly married, the Bridegroom was yet with them, and the Nuptials yet celebrating, particular|ly <HI>Mathew's:</HI> But when the Bridegroom &s;hould be remov'd from them, to a far Country, then our Lord &s;ignifies, that it would be a proper time for them to &s;it as a Widow in &s;olitude and fa&s;ting; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to this, that under the Jewi&s;h Oeconomy, Per&s;ons newly mar|ry'd were, for a time, to be freed from the fatigues of War.</P>
<P>FARTHER, The Di&s;ciples being but beginners in Religion, and not yet accu&s;tom'd to the &s;everer Exerci&s;es of it, as the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John</HI> were, <HI>who came neither eating nor drinking,</HI> as their Ma&s;ter did. Now in &s;uch a Situation, to put them frequently upon fa&s;t|ing might, perhaps, di&s;courage them in Religion, or prejudice them again&s;t it, and &s;o drive them to Apo&s;tacy from the Profe&s;&s;ion of it: It was like to be of as ill con&s;equence as <HI>puting new Cloth upon an old thin Garment,</HI> and <HI>new Wine into old Casks:</HI> But to lead them to tho&s;e Severities by Degrees, was the mo&s;t rational and &s;afe Method, (See <HI>Mark</HI> ii. <HI>from the</HI> 18 <HI>to the</HI> 23 <HI>ver&s;e</HI>) The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us con&s;ults the Frame and Strength of his Followers, and Proportions their Difficulties thereto; <HI>he carries the Lambs in his Arms, and leads tho&s;e gently that are with Young;</HI> nor will he, who is Love and Goodne&s;s it&s;elf, <HI>break the brui&s;ed r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, or quench the &s;moaking Flax!</HI></P>
<P>IT may be again objected, that the <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> recommended by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in our Text, is only &s;piritual fa&s;ting from Sin.</P>
<P N="1">I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> That &s;uch a Notion is contrary to the <HI>etymology</HI> of the original Word, <HI>(ne&s;teuete)</HI> which, as <HI>Pa&s;or</HI> ob&s;erves, is derived from <HI>ne,</HI> which in compounds is negative or privative, and <HI>ethio</HI> to eat; &s;o that to <HI>fa&s;t</HI> is not to eat, or to be without meat.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e contrary to the univer&s;al <HI>Acceptation</HI> of the Word <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> in Scripture, as well as to its current meaning in other Writings; and the received ideoms of Speech.</P>
<P>AND it is likewi&s;e attended with many <HI>ab&s;urdities,</HI> a few of which I &s;hall mention; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>IT is foreign to the Subject of CHRIST'S Di&s;cour&s;e in our Text, which was the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> Fa&s;ting in a literal Sen&s;e. It &s;uppo&s;es an analogy between Sin and Bread, and con&s;equently repre&s;ents it as nece&s;&s;ary in ordinary Ca&s;es; as good in it&s;elf; as nouri&s;h|ing to the Soul as Bread is to the Body; and likewi&s;e that it is only to be ab&s;tained from at &s;ome extraordinary Sea&s;ons; and that when we do ab&s;tain from it, we &s;hould not appear to Men to do &s;o; that is, in other Words, we mu&s;t carefully avoid con|fe&s;&s;ing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> before Men; whereas the Redeemer in the mean Time a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>if we are a&s;hamed of him and his Words, he al&s;o will be a&s;hamed of us, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with the holy Angels.</HI></P>
<P>AT this rate of allegorizing without nece&s;&s;ity or pre&s;ident, and contrary to the Context, the reality of the Creation of the World and of Mankind may be deny'd, and on the contrary their
<PB N="16" REF="040518_0016_1015E8FBD2DB3D70">
eternity contended for, &s;eeing Conver&s;ion is called a Creation; and indeed the Ca&s;e is &s;o with the <HI>Bemi&s;ts,</HI> they po&s;itively deny the Creation.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> Body from the Dead, toge|ther with all his <HI>miraculous Works,</HI> may be in like manner deny'd, for Conver&s;ion is called a Re&s;urrection in Scripture.

<P>AFTER the &s;ame Manner may al&s;o the <HI>Lord's-Supper</HI> be &s;piri|tualized, and then it will follow, that it is a damnable Sin to feed upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by Faith, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> believe in him; for it is &s;aid, that <HI>he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks Damnation to him&s;elf.</HI> Now what is &s;piritual eating and drinking, but believ|ing? and yet the Scripture &s;ays, that <HI>he that believes &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> In a Word, the literal Certainty of Scripture Doctrines and Facts, will be render'd hereby precarious, and &s;o the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation unhing'd!

<P>THE <HI>preparatory Offices,</HI> or Duties, are the&s;e two e&s;pecially, viz. <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> and <HI>laying a&s;ide our worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> We &s;hould &s;ea&s;onably and &s;olemnly con&s;ider the Nature and Qualities of the Occa&s;ions of the Fa&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the Judgments of God, to|gether with the number and heniou&s;ne&s;s of our Sins the procu|ring Cau&s;es of them. The&s;e Things we &s;hould ponder upon
<PB N="17" REF="040518_0017_1015E8FEE01C5A28">
and realize till our Hearts are deeply affected with a fear of God, with &s;orrow for our Offences again&s;t him; with a de&s;ire after his favour, and a Re&s;olution to &s;eek and &s;erve him; and hence it is &s;aid of <HI>Jeho&s;aphat, that he fear'd and &s;et him|&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord, and proclaim'd a fa&s;t throughout all</HI> Ju|dah, (2 Chron. xx. iii)</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Preparative,</HI> is to lay a&s;ide timeou&s;ly our <HI>worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and order our temporal Concerns in &s;uch a Manner, that they may be no hindrance to us in the Duties of the Fa&s;t. (<HI>Levit.</HI> xxiii. 7, 8.) And no doubt the&s;e Preparatives &s;hould be attended with devout Addre&s;&s;es to God for divine Influence, without which nothing can be done to purpo&s;e in Religion,</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>peculiar Duties</HI> that re&s;pect the Celebration of the Fa&s;t, are either Negative or Po&s;itive. The <HI>Negative</HI> are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>ABSTINENCE from all Food and Drink, as much as our Health can bear. (<HI>E&s;t.</HI> iv. 16)</P>
<P>ABSTINENCE from all <HI>bodily Recreations,</HI> (Joel ii. 16.) <HI>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Clo&s;et.</HI> (I&s;a. lviii 3.) <HI>Behold in the Day of your fa&s;t ye find Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>ABSTINENCE from all <HI>Ornaments of Dre&s;s,</HI> un&s;uitable to a Day of Humiliation. (I&s;a. xxii. 12.) <HI>In that Day did the Lord call to weeping and mourning, to baldne&s;s and girding with Sack|cloth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Po&s;itive Duties</HI> are the&s;e, namely, <HI>Humiliation, Prayer,</HI> and <HI>renewing our Covenant with God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;hould humble our&s;elves before Jehovah, in a Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Sin, a Condemnation of our&s;elves for Sin, a Purpo&s;e and Promi&s;e to for&s;ake it, and practice Virtue. And hence a Day of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> is called by God him&s;elf, <HI>a Day for a Man to af|flict his Soul,</HI> (I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a. lviii. 5.)</P>
<P N="2">2. Another po&s;itive Duty in the Time of the Fa&s;t, is <HI>calling upon God's Name.</HI> Eza. viii. 21. <HI>Then proclaimed I a fa&s;t at the River Ahava, that we might afflict our&s;elves before our God, to &s;eek of him a right way for us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>RENEWING our Covenant with God,</HI> is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, (2 Kings xxiii. 2, 3) <HI>And the King &s;tood by a Pillar and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord and keep his Com|mandments, with all their Heart and all their Soul. And all the People &s;tood to the Covenant.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary on a Day of fa&s;ting, to renew our Con&s;ent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, to renew our Re&s;olution to perform the Duties thereby required; and to renew our reliance upon the Promi&s;es therein contained, for Guidance and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to perform the afore&s;aid Duties.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed, The principal Duty con&s;equent upon <HI>fa&s;t|ing,</HI> is <HI>Reformation of Life,</HI> which &s;hould be immediately begun in Church, State, Families, and particular Per&s;ons. 2 Chron. vii. 14. <HI>If my People which are called by my Name &s;hall hum|ble them&s;elves and pray, and &s;eek my Face, and turn from their
<PB N="18" REF="040518_0018_1015E9006438DF78">
wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven and will forgive their Sin and heal their Land. The Fa&s;t that God hath cho&s;en,</HI> as was before ob&s;erved, <HI>is to loo&s;e the Bands of Wickedne&s;s, and undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppre&s;s'd go free, and deal our Bread to the Hungry, and to break every Yoke.</HI> When fa&s;ting is duly ob&s;erved, it will incline us, in our after life, to avoid all the Methods of Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Cruelty; and on the Con|trary, to be merciful and charitable in the Sentiments of our Minds, the Speeches of our Lips, and the Actions of our Lives.</P>
<P>BUT more particularly in our <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>fa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;hould beware of <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> that we do not with the Phari&s;ees in our Text, put on a gui&s;e of extraordinary Devotion, meerly out of Pride, to get a Name among Men; or with <HI>Je&s;abel</HI> cover a covetous and cruel Intention therewith Of the &s;ame &s;tamp were tho&s;e impious Jews, the Royal Prophet &s;peaks of, who <HI>fa&s;ted for &s;trife and debate, to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of Wicked|ne&s;s:</HI> They oppre&s;s'd the Poor by their Cruelties, ground their Faces, and laid intollerable Yokes upon their Necks, notwith|&s;tanding of their pious Pretences.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE &s;hould beware of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> in our Fa&s;ts, by an over frequent U&s;e of them, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are of a publick Na|ture. Fa&s;ting is an extraordinary Duty, and therefore not to be practi&s;ed on ordinary Occa&s;ions; otherwi&s;e it is apt to degenerate into Super&s;tition; to make Religion burden&s;om, and di&s;courage the Weak.</P>
<P>IT is unrea&s;onable in any to make the Yoke of Chri&s;t heavier than he has made it. Our compa&s;&s;ionate Lord, who is Wi&s;dom and Love it&s;elf, did not think it proper to impo&s;e upon his Di&s;|ciples, either the Rigors of the legal Mini&s;tration, or the Bur|den&s;om Traditions of the Phari&s;ees, or even the Au&s;terity of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t;</HI> and hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>his Yoke is ea&s;y, and his Burden light.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WE &s;hould beware of <HI>formality,</HI> in re&s;ting &s;atisfy'd with the outward Performance of the Duties of the Day, without an inward Sen&s;e of them, and without a Reformation of Life, this formal Fa&s;ting is of no avail. Of &s;uch the Almighty God com|plains by the Prophet, <HI>Zeca.</HI> vii, 5. <HI>did ye at all fa&s;t unto me, i. e.</HI> ye did not regard my Honour as your principal Scope in fa&s;ting, nor an&s;wer the End thereof, which is Amendment of Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE &s;hould likewi&s;e beware of the <HI>Papal</HI> Notion of <HI>merit|ing</HI> by our fa&s;ting, or of terminating the Wor&s;hip in the <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> it&s;elf, which is only de&s;igned to qualify us for divine Wor&s;hip: Seeing we are both Creatures and Criminals, and as &s;uch owe to God a Debt of perfect Duty and infinite Penalty, which we can never pay, being both fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and imperfect, it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that we can Merit any Thing at God's Hand, by any In&s;tance of our obedience, No! <HI>When we have done all we can, we are un|profitable Servants.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="040518_0019_1015E9032E0900F0">ON the contrary therefore, we &s;hould endeavour to perform the Duties of the Day, with humility, &s;incerity, faith, contrition and Reverence; hereby labouring to approve our&s;elves to him, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, and will reward the upright openly: Which brings me to the</P>
<P N="3">III. HEAD of Di&s;cour&s;e, which was to repre&s;ent the <HI>Advan|tages and Importance of the Duty of Fa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. FASTING has a natural Tendency to curb our &s;en&s;ual Appe|tites, by withdrawing the Fuel that inflames them As &s;ome Savage Bea&s;ts are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am'd by Hunger, &s;o are tho&s;e brought hereby under the controul of Rea&s;on and Religion. Ab&s;tinence was the fir&s;t precept given to Man in Innocency, the Violation of which, has been the Source of innumerable Evils and Calamities to the whole human Race.</P>
<P N="2">2. FASTING is of <HI>advantage</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Performance of all Religious Duties. A few of which I &s;hall mention, viz. <HI>Prayer, hearing the Word of God, Charity</HI> and <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>IT was from the Per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI>'s being a help to prayer, that <HI>Jeho&s;aphat, Ezra,</HI> and <HI>Nehemia,</HI> anexed it thereto, in Junc|tures of great Di&s;tre&s;s, when they wanted to exert the utmo&s;t vehemence and fervours! Rea&s;on teaches us, that as fullne&s;s of Bread is apt to make us drow&s;ie, &s;o on the Contrary, Ab&s;tinence tends to make us more lively in religious Exerci&s;es!</P>
<P>NOR has religious <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> le&s;s aptne&s;s to prepare the Mind to hear the divine Word with Attention and Reverence. <HI>Jere|miah</HI> the Prophet, was aware of this, and therefore ordered <HI>Baruch,</HI> the Son of <HI>Nereiah,</HI> to read the Roll of threatnings in the Ears of all <HI>Judah,</HI> in the Day of publick fa&s;ting; expecting that at that Time it would make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on them, (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxxvi. 6.) ina&s;much as their Minds were freed from the fumes of the Body, and &s;eparated from the Entertainments of Sen&s;e, they mu&s;t of Con&s;equence be more &s;erious and compo&s;ed, and therefore better prepar'd to give due Attention to the divine Oracles.</P>
<P>AND does not <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> likewi&s;e tend to promote our <HI>Charity,</HI> for being hereby made &s;en&s;ible of want and hunger our&s;elves, we are by our own Experience naturally led to compa&s;&s;ionate tho&s;e who are by nece&s;&s;ity forc'd to graple with &s;uch hard&s;hips, and of Con&s;equence to relieve them. This not only Rea&s;on Demon&s;trates, but evident Facts confirm, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who was as famous for his <HI>liberality</HI> as his <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>prayers,</HI> (Acts x.) His ab&s;tinence &s;tir'd the Bowels of his Humanity to &s;uccour the In|digent.</P>
<P>FARTHER, my Brethren, <HI>ab&s;tinence</HI> promotes Humiliation and Contrition for Sin, by making us ta&s;te the bitter Fruits of it; by denying our&s;elves of tho&s;e Supports and Comforts, we aba&s;e our&s;elves in &s;ignifying our unworthine&s;s of them, and Submi&s;&s;ion to God's Government over us; as well as execute &s;ome rea&s;ona|ble revenge upon our&s;elves, for our Rebellion again&s;t his Autho|rity,
<PB N="20" REF="040518_0020_1015E90523884488">
by the abu&s;e of his Creatures: Our feeling the painful Fruits that Sin has produc'd among Mankind, mu&s;t needs tend to excite equal Indignation again&s;t it, and Sorrow for it, as well as a ju&s;t Fear of the divine Judgments: Hence it is that Times of fa&s;ting were Sea&s;ons of uncommon Sorrow in every Age of the Church, as appears from the In&s;tances before produc'd, to which, for the Sake of Brevity, I mu&s;t not add.</P>
<P N="3">3. FASTING is not only an efficacious and profitable, but very nece&s;&s;ary Mean, to prevent the execution of extraordinary Judg|ments threatned; as evidently appears from the memorable exam|ples of the Fa&s;t of the Jews in the Time of Queen <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ther,</HI> and of the <HI>Ninivites,</HI> who were both hereby delivered from a National De&s;truction, and that very near at Hand.</P>
<P N="4">4. RELIGIOUS Fa&s;ting is of equal advantage and efficacy to remove Judgments or Calamites that are actually inflicted; of this I would mention the two following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>IN the civil Wars between the <HI>Benjamites</HI> and <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> the latter having been very un&s;ucce&s;sful in their undertaking again&s;t the former, thereupon kept a publick and &s;olemn Fa&s;t, which was crown'd with Succe&s;s and Victory! (<HI>Judg.</HI> xx)</P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Samuel</HI> was Judge in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with de&s;ign to te&s;tify their Repentance for their Iniquities and promote Reformation from them, he order'd the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be conveen'd at <HI>Mi&s;peh</HI> to a publick <HI>Fa&s;t;</HI> which they kept with great Affection, and &s;oon &s;aw the happy Fruits thereof, in a very &s;urprizing con|que&s;t over their <HI>Phili&s;tine</HI> Enemies, who ignobly attack'd them with ho&s;tile violence, in the very time of their religious wor|&s;hip. (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> vii.)</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>FASTING</HI> ob&s;erved with a proper frame of Mind, is con|ducive to obtain the mo&s;t important Benefits, temporal, &s;piritual, and eternal; that either particular Per&s;ons or Societies need. An In&s;tance of this we have in <HI>Ezra,</HI> who proclaimed a <HI>fa&s;t</HI> in or|der to obtain the Guidance and Smiles of Heaven, in and upon the difficult but important Enterprize of <HI>rebuilding Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and hereby obtained his generous and noble De&s;ign!</P>
<P>THIS View in <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> was not peculiar to the <HI>Old-Te&s;tament,</HI> but is common to both. In entring upon all Matters of great Dif|ficulty and Moment, both CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles <HI>fa&s;ted</HI> as was before ob&s;erv'd. Our Lord's <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s,</HI> was pre|paratory to his engaging in the publick Mini&s;try, and his Apo|&s;tles followed his Example herein, by religious Ab&s;tinence, before they undertook that &s;acred Work; and in all &s;ucceeding Ages, the Practice of the Church has been agreeable to tho&s;e noble Pre&s;idents, and in this Way they have reap'd valuable Ad|vantages!</P>
<P>WHEN a Time of general Calamity and De&s;olation is &s;ent, by a righteous GOD to puni&s;h the Iniquities of a &s;inful People, then a <HI>Mark</HI> is &s;et upon the Foreheads of the Men, that &s;igh and cry for all the Abominations, which are done in the Places where they
<PB N="21" REF="040518_0021_1015E90784872A18">
have their re&s;pective Re&s;idence! (<HI>Ezek.</HI> ix.) A Mark of Di&s;tinc|tion, of Honour, and Protection; &s;uch noble Souls as weep in &s;ecret for the Di&s;honours done to GOD, by the afore&s;aid Evils, &s;hall be confe&s;&s;ed by him another Day; yea, and comforted in this! Almighty GOD &s;eals the&s;e his Servants, and marks <HI>Zyons</HI> Mourners, he books their &s;ecret Sighs, and bottles up all their Tears!</P>
<P>BUT the Benefits of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> &s;incerly, and &s;uitably performed, are not confin'd to this State of Tryal and Probation, but extend beyond the Grave. That gracious GOD who beholds &s;uch with Complacence he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will gloriou&s;ly adorn them hereafter, with a Crown of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s that &s;hall never fade away: He who &s;eeth in &s;ecret has graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to reward them openly, and will be as good as his Word; he who is the Witne&s;s of their Suffer|ings and Labours, and Integrity in both, mercifully accepts of, and is plea&s;ed with their &s;ecret Sorrows and Groanings, and will finally admit them to a State of &s;upream Dignity, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Felicity, which &s;hall know no Compari&s;on, no Intermi&s;&s;ion, no End! As In&s;tances of pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, are more difficult than active, and therefore more noble, <HI>(nam quo &s;ublimiora eo dificiliora)</HI> &s;o of Con&s;equence they will meet with a greater Recompen&s;e: Now among tho&s;e, may be reckoned the denying of Our&s;elves at Times, of the Comforts of Life for CHRIST'S Sake; all &s;uch may therefore rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is their Reward in Heaven: Such as &s;uffer for CHRIST and the Go&s;pel's &s;ake, in any kind or degree &s;hall in this Life receive an Hundred-fold, and in the World to come Life everla&s;ting: The Spirit of Glory and of GOD re&s;ts upon them in the Way, and their Man|&s;ion of Bli&s;s at the End of their religious Cour&s;e, &s;hall be of di&s;|tingui&s;hed Beauty and Lu&s;tre, commen&s;urate to their Sorrows, their Sufferings, and their Labours here! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>What has been &s;aid, re&s;pecting the natural Tendency, and Advan|tages of religious Fa&s;ting, as well as the <HI>Pagan</HI>'s Di&s;covery hereof, by the meer Force of human Rea&s;on, plainly &s;hew that it is no arbitrary and alterable In&s;titution, but grounded upon the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, which being ever the &s;ame, it is therefore moral, and of perpe|tual Obligation.</P>
<P>To be freed from any Duty of this kind, by the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> would make it an unrea&s;onable and di&s;advantageous Di&s;pen&s;ation, inferior at lea&s;t in that Point to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> OEconomy, to which it is frequently and ju&s;tly preferred by the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, and declared to be a rea&s;onable Service; to be bereaved of a valuable Advantage, is no Priviledge, but a great Lo&s;s!</P>
<P>Moreover &s;eeing it is in this Life only, that temporal Judgements can be inflicted on a Society as &s;uch, and temporal Mercies vouch&s;afed according to their general Behaviour, agreeable to the Rules of God's moral Government; it is therefore rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, that Socie|ties as &s;uch &s;hould unite in publick and &s;ocial Acts of Humiliation, to avert the one, and obtain the other.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>WHAT has been &s;aid, my Brethren and Fathers, &s;erves to in|form us how impious and unrea&s;onable it is in any, either to op|po&s;e or neglect, the &s;ea&s;onable Ob&s;ervance of an In&s;titution, &s;o firmly bottom'd on the highe&s;t Authority, and &s;o directly conducive to &s;ecure and advance our mo&s;t important Intere&s;ts!</P>
<P>IT is trifling to object, that <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> is ob&s;erved by the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and therefore &s;hould be neglected.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, mu&s;t we di&s;believe and neglect all that they believe and practice, then we mu&s;t deny the Being of a GOD, and that CHRIST is the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> becau&s;e they believe both; and we mu&s;t quit Prayer entirely, becau&s;e they ob&s;erve it, in &s;ome Sort; the bare mentioning of which Ab&s;urdities &s;ufficiently ex|po&s;es them!</P>

<P>OUR growth in Goodne&s;s is undoubtedly much marr'd by the afore&s;aid Neglect.

<P>TO have Sea&s;ons &s;et apart for <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> exceedingly becomes the Saints and People of GOD: Thus the Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas prayed with fa&s;ting, (Acts</HI> xiv. 2, 3.)<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The original Word <HI>ne&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> is the &s;ame with that in our text.</NOTE></P>
<P>FASTING, Sirs, has been practiced by the Profe&s;&s;ors of re|vealed Religion, from time immemorial.</P>
<P>FASTING has been ob&s;erved by divers Infidels of different Nations, by the Direction of natural Rea&s;on only.</P>
<P>FASTING is intirely rational; for &s;eeing God has made the Body, it is but proper he &s;hould be &s;erved by it.</P>
<P>FASTING is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Duty, both in re&s;pect of <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Mean,</HI> appointed by the highe&s;t Authority, as a Medium to ob|tain the mo&s;t precious, valuable and durable Benefits.</P>
<P>FASTING is an honourable Duty, in re&s;pect of its Author, Nature and I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Author</HI> of it, is the ble&s;&s;ed God, who is the Fountain of all Honour, which merits that Character.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Nature</HI> of it contains an In&s;tance of the Creatures Ho|mage and Subjection to the Sovereign Authority of its Creator and Lord, and that both in his Precepts and Providences, which being agreeable to the Rules of Ju&s;tice, and Maxims of Rea&s;on, mu&s;t needs be Honourable,</P>
<P>THE <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> of it rightly ob&s;erved, will be the open Appro|bation of the infinitely wi&s;e God, and a State of perfect con|formity to the un&s;tain'd purity of the divine Nature, and un|interrupted Communion in the divine Love, and the ravi&s;hing
<PB N="24" REF="040518_0024_1015E90EC00E7EF0">
Contemplation of the divine Excellency; all which imply the highe&s;t Honours a God can give, and a created Nature receive: E&s;&s;ential and inflexible Truth has told us, <HI>that tho&s;e that Honour him, he will Honour.</HI> But to proceed,</P>
<P>FASTING is a <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> Duty. I confe&s;s it is contrary to the vicious Propen&s;ities of our degenerate Natures, which verge to Ea&s;e, to Indolence and &s;en&s;ual Gratifications inordinately; and con&s;equently make Men reluctant to re&s;traint, tho' never &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, re&s;onable, decent, and honourable; and this doubtle&s;s is the &s;ecret &s;ource of the Strong Prejudices of many again&s;t the Duty I have been di&s;cour&s;ing upon.</P>
<P>IT is indeed extreamly difficult for the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to urge any Thing &s;ucce&s;sfully, that touches Men in &s;o tender a Point; their Affections are apt greatly to bya&s;s their Judgment, in favour of what they love, tho' never &s;o criminal; and even to that degree, that they will hardly give a fair hearing to what is offered again&s;t it. But &s;eeing the Nature of Things, my Brethren, cannot be chang'd by your Fancies and Prejudices, and you mu&s;t be judg'd at la&s;t according to them, it is your wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e to be impartial; and therefore we do in the Name of our Ma&s;ter, the KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS, de&s;ire and demand a fair hearing, and calm Con&s;ideration of what we &s;ay.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the Duty of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> be cro&s;s to our na|tural Inclinations, as has been ob&s;erved, yet it is agreeable to the Mind, ina&s;much as it helps to reduce it to its ju&s;t Empire over the &s;en&s;ual Appetites, and free it from their tyrannical Mutinies and Encroachments: And thus it tends to introduce a &s;olemn Calm into the Soul, and bring it near to the ble&s;&s;ed God, the ori|ginal Beauty and &s;upream Good, the &s;ource of Sweetne&s;s, and center of Re&s;t, who&s;e <HI>loving Kindne&s;s is better than life,</HI> and can only yield &s;olid Satisfaction.</P>
<P>IN a Word, <HI>Sirs,</HI> this opens a Fountain of &s;piritual, &s;ublime and &s;uperior Sweets, which infinitely tran&s;cend all brutal Plea&s;ures; as well as exactly &s;uit the &s;piritual and noble Nature, and realy equal the va&s;t De&s;ires, the rais'd Hopes, and end|le&s;s Duration of a human Soul! And may be reflected on with|out unea&s;ine&s;s: Surely <HI>Wi&s;doms Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all its Paths are Peace.</HI> Again,</P>
<P>FASTING is a <HI>profitable</HI> Duty, as well as plea&s;ant: It is profit|able, my Brethren, to human Society in general, by preventing and removing publick Calamities, and in obtaining publick, pre|cious and permanent Benefits.</P>
<P>IT is profitable to our&s;elves in particular, many Ways.</P>
<P>FASTING is profitable to our Bodies, in correcting their natu|ral Di&s;orders: By it the crudeties occa&s;ion'd thro' exce&s;&s;es, are gradually dige&s;ted and remov'd, and the Stomack, the Fountain of our nouri&s;hment, brought to its proper tone, and fitted for its proper Functions.</P>
<P>FASTING is profitable to our Souls, in curing their moral

Maladies and Di&s;orders: By it, our &s;ordid, &s;en&s;ual, brutal Incli|nations are weakned, thro the Sub&s;traction of their Incentives.</P>
<P>FASTING a&s;&s;i&s;ts in all the religious Offices we owe to God and Man, as has been already ob&s;erved, and thus we are A&s;&s;i|milated to the Author of our Exi&s;tence, which is at once our highe&s;t Dignity and greate&s;t Felicity.</P>
<P>FASTING, Sirs, is not only pofitable in Time, but its &s;alutary Effects reach to Eternity. Such as now ob&s;erve it in due Man|ner, <HI>their Father who &s;eeth in &s;ecret will reward them openly,</HI> his Promi&s;e is firmer than the Foundations of the Earth, and cannot fail.</P>
<P>WHATEVER unju&s;t Invectives may be ca&s;t upon them by Infi|dels and Epicures, <HI>who make their Belly their God, and Glory in their &s;hame,</HI> they will meet with divine Approbation; that God who &s;ees the Sincerity of their Intentions, will finally vindicate their Conduct, and put Honour on their Per&s;ons, before the va&s;t A&s;&s;embly of the Univer&s;e!</P>
<P>WHILE impenitent Sen&s;uali&s;ts and profane Scoffers, <HI>who walk after their own Lu&s;ts,</HI> are cover'd with &s;hame and Comtempt, and rack'd with the accute&s;t Angui&s;h, the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> will acco&s;t his People in this gracious Language, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, and inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lord Redeemer will give them a <HI>Reward</HI> of Mercy, more than proportion'd to their Self-denyal, Diligence and Fidelity.</P>
<P>A REWARD which no human Under&s;tanding can gra&s;p with its &s;ublime&s;t flights of Thought and grande&s;t Sentiments; or hu|man Tongue expre&s;s with all the Charms of Diction, with all the figures, fires and force of Language!</P>
<P>A REWARD which the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;triking Images in univer&s;al Nature are not equal to, but faint before and &s;ink in darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity!</P>
<P>A REWARD, large as our De&s;ires, and la&s;ting as our Souls!</P>
<P>A REWARD of &s;uch immen&s;e weight and value, that all the light and momentary Sufferings of this pre&s;ent Life, are not wor|thy to be once compared with it.</P>
<P>A REWARD that contains a perfect and perpetual freedom from every Evil, both moral and penal; and the uninterrupted and eternal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Good!</P>
<P>SO that all manner of incentives con&s;pire to incite us to cele|brate this Solemnity, <HI>viz.</HI> The divine <HI>Authority, Honour, Plea|&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of every Kind; the Principles of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Gratitude;</HI> the <HI>Examples</HI> of others, and a regard to the publick <HI>Weal.</HI> May Almighty God therefore of his infinite Goodne&s;s, enable us to perform the Duties of this Day, with &s;uch Humi|lity, Ardor and Integrity, that he who <HI>&s;eeth in &s;ecret may Reward us openly</HI> thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, Amen.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>JONAH iii. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But let Man and Bea&s;t be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily unto GOD: Yea, let them turn every Man from his evil Way, and from the Violence that is in their Hands.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN this Chapter we are informed, that the Prophet <HI>Jonah</HI> was commi&s;&s;ioned by the Almighty to go to the City of <HI>Ni|neveh,</HI> and threaten it with a &s;udden Overthrow, in Ca&s;e they did not repent and reform: Tho' the Threatning was expre&s;&s;ed ab&s;olutely, yet certainly a Condition was implied, and in this Sen&s;e the <HI>Ninevites</HI> under&s;tood it, o|therwi&s;e they would not have en|deavoured by the U&s;e of any Means to avert the impending Calamity.</P>
<P>THE Prophet, after the miraculous Cure of his criminal Reluc|tance, executed his Commi&s;&s;ion with Zeal and Earne&s;tne&s;s, <HI>When he entered the City a Day's Journey, he cried and &s;aid, yet forty Days and</HI> Nineveh <HI>&s;hall be overthrown:</HI> His bold and faithful De|livery of his Me&s;&s;age, was attended with happy Influence and Succe&s;s, both upon the Prince and People; for in Con&s;equence hereof <HI>they believed GOD,</HI> and <HI>proclaimed a fa&s;t,</HI> and <HI>put on Sackcloth from the greate&s;t of them even to the lea&s;t.</HI> Tho' <HI>Jo|nah</HI> was a <HI>Stranger</HI> to them, yet his ju&s;t De&s;cription of their Sins, his authoritative Declaration of their Danger and Doom, in Ca&s;e they per&s;i&s;ted in them; together with the Con&s;ideration of a Po&s;|&s;ibility of E&s;cape in the U&s;e of proper Means, being attended with divine Influence, induced them to <HI>believe the GOD of</HI> I&s;|rael, <HI>i. e.</HI> not only to give Credit to the Threatning which <HI>Jonah</HI> denounced in his Name, but to believe him to be the Supream Lord of the Univer&s;e, who&s;e Laws they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by their Impieties, and to who&s;e Ju&s;tice they were of Con&s;equence ob|noxious; they clearly &s;aw their De&s;ert of Puni&s;hment, and there|fore dreaded the Menace, which the Prophet publi&s;hed in the Name of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="040518_0027_1015E915550D09C0">Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on as they believed GOD, a <HI>fa&s;t</HI> was immediately proclaimed by publick Authority, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Decree of the King and his Nobles, the King and Council concurred herein unanimou&s;ly, and enjoined the Ob&s;ervation of a <HI>fa&s;t</HI> by an authori|tative Act.</P>
<P>WHEN the Account of the Prophet's Errand to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> was brought to the <HI>King,</HI> who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be not <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> but <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul Belochus,</HI> he immediately aro&s;e from his <HI>Throne,</HI> as <HI>Eglon,</HI> King of <HI>Moab</HI> did, when <HI>Ehud</HI> &s;ignify'd that he had a Me&s;&s;age to him from GOD: The King of <HI>Nineveh</HI> ro&s;e up, doubtle&s;s to ex|pre&s;s his Reverence to a Word from God; as well as his Fear of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivine Di&s;plea&s;ure, demerited by his and his People's Sins; he likewi&s;e laid a&s;ide his Royal <HI>Robe,</HI> the Badge of his &s;upream Dig|nity, and put on the rough, the humble Dre&s;s of a Mourner, <HI>he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red him&s;elf with Sackcloth and &s;at in A&s;hes,</HI> to &s;ignify his Humiliation for Sin, and Dread of the divine Vengeance on ac|count thereof; a heroick, a noble Example, well worthy of a Prince of the highe&s;t Order and va&s;te&s;t Empire!</P>
<P>TO revere the Author of our Exi&s;tence, and go before others in good Examples tho of the humble&s;t kind, at all Adventures, is not only a Proof of the &s;obere&s;t Exerci&s;e of human Rea&s;on, but an Argument of a great and brave Mind!</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t of Men are not &s;o much an Ornament to Religion by their pious Practice, as it is to them: In the mean Time, it is certainly an important Benefit to any People, when &s;uch who are in high Places of civil Tru&s;t among them, are Men fearing GOD and hating Covetuou&s;ne&s;s; for their Example is apt to have great Influence on others in lower Life, as we &s;ee by the <HI>Nine|vites,</HI> who imitated the laudable Pattern of their Prince. It is a ju&s;t and general Maxim, that <HI>Example</HI> has more Efficacy than <HI>Precept,</HI> and that by the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> in particular, their <HI>Subjects</HI> are form'd.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Precepta docent, exempla cogunt, ad exemplum regis, totus, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT on the contrary when Per&s;ons who are cloth'd with civil Authority, and bear &s;ome figure in high Life, are not only de&s;titute of Religion them&s;elves, but deride it in others with equal Vanity and Virulence, thereby indu&s;triou&s;ly labouring to &s;ubvert all the valuable Intere&s;ts of Society (of which Religion is the grand Support) which it is therefore the Duty of their Offices to encourage. I &s;ay when they are neither willing to <HI>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven them&s;elves, nor to &s;uffer tho&s;e that are en|tring to enter,</HI> it is no wonder if the pious and prudent lament! Seeing their impious Conduct, is as <HI>a troubled Fountain, and a cor|rupt Spring,</HI> of who&s;e Waters the Inhabitants of a City drink! <HI>When the Righteous,</HI> &s;aith Solomon, <HI>are in Authority, the People rejoice! But when the Wicked bear Rule, the People mourn!</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed. The King of <HI>Nineveh</HI> took particular Care, to have a <HI>fa&s;t</HI> &s;peedily appointed and notify'd to the People by
<PB N="28" REF="040518_0028_1015E917BA74E3B8">
tho&s;e publick Officers who were wont to proclaim the Edicts of the King and Council. It is &s;aid that he cau&s;ed it to be proclaim|ed and publi&s;hed: This ingemination or redoubling of the Words, not only confirms the Certainty of the Fact, but likewi&s;e &s;ignifies the deep Sen&s;e which the <HI>King</HI> had, both of his own and his Peo|ple's Sins, Danger, and Duty in this Exigence: The Concurrence of the Legi&s;lature in the Appointment of the <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> and of the Body of the People in the Celebration of it, made it a national Act, and it was proper it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;eeing a national De&s;truction was to be prevented by it.</P>
<P>NOW the Contents of the <HI>Proclamation</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Niniveh,</HI> for a publick <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> which are to be the <HI>Subject</HI> of our pre&s;ent <HI>Meditations,</HI> we have in the Words of our <HI>Text,</HI> together with the preeceeding and following Ver&s;es. The&s;e Contents &s;hew us what was required by the Proclamation, and to what De&s;ign: They are indeed a valuable compend and &s;ummary of the principal Duties to be performed on &s;uch So|lemnities, in all &s;ucceeding Times. The Duties mentioned are the&s;e four, viz. <HI>Ab&s;tinence, Humiliation</HI> or <HI>Mourning, Prayer</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Proclamation</HI> required a total <HI>ab&s;tinence</HI> from Food and Drink, both by Man and Bea&s;t; <HI>let neither Man or Bea&s;t ta&s;te any Thing, or drink Water.</HI> To pretend to <HI>fa&s;t</HI> without ab&s;taining from Food and Drink, and all the Comforts of Life, as far as can con&s;i&s;t with the &s;afety of our Bodies, and their fit|ne&s;s for religious Service, is meer mockery.</P>
<P>AND to add to the Solemnity of the <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> at that extraordinary Juncture, the Bea&s;ts were to be re&s;trained from Food and Drink, that a view of their Mi&s;eries might affect the People the more, and that the Cry of Man, &s;econded by the cry of hungry Cattle, might enter the Ears of God, who pre&s;erveth Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Proclamation</HI> required, that Man and Bea&s;t &s;hould be <HI>covered with Sackcloth;</HI> The Men were to put on a coar&s;e, a humble and unea&s;y Dre&s;s, to &s;ignify the Humiliation of their Souls for Sin, and their Sorrow on the account of it, as well as fear of the divine Vengeance impending over them.</P>
<P>AND even the Bea&s;ts mu&s;t do Penance, as it were, as well as Man, becau&s;e they had been made &s;ubject to vanity as In&s;truments of his Sin; that either by their complaints, or &s;ilent pining for want of Food, they might &s;trike the Springs of their Owners Sorrows!</P>
<P>AND tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, particularly the Hor&s;es and Camels, on which they rode, and were wont to cover with rich Trapings, mu&s;t be &s;tripp'd of tho&s;e <HI>Ornaments</HI> and clad in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> a|greeable to the antient and modern Cu&s;tom of covering Hor&s;es with black Cloth, at the Funerals of Noblemen; that they might &s;eem to mourn on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI> ob&s;erves. The <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> in a Time of mourning, were al&s;o accu&s;tom'd to poll or clip their Hor&s;es, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> informs us.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="040518_0029_1015E919408BA218">SO that to be cover'd with <HI>Sackcloth</HI> &s;eems to be a proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ignifying deep <HI>Mourning</HI> and <HI>Grief.</HI> Thus the Hea|vens are &s;aid, by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, to be cover'd with Sackcloth:</HI> The chief Thing therefore here demanded of the <HI>Ninivites,</HI> was that they would humble them&s;elves before God, becau&s;e of their Offences again&s;t him, and that they would with bitterne&s;s bewail them.</P>
<P>NO doubt at a Time of publick <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> the <HI>Garb</HI> &s;hould be &s;uited to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day; but that which is e&s;pecially ne|ce&s;&s;ary, is a <HI>humble,</HI> a <HI>mourning Mind;</HI> a &s;incere mourning from the Heart, an Evangelical mourning from love to that God whom by Sin we have provok'd: A mourning great in Degree, &s;ome|what proportion'd to the Number and heniou&s;ne&s;s of our Sins: Thus <HI>Samuel</HI> te&s;tifies of the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that <HI>they gathered together in Mi&s;peh, and drew Water and pourd it out before the Lord, and fa&s;ted on that Day.</HI> The&s;e Words are de&s;igned to repre&s;ent in a figurative manner, the plentiful mourning of the People of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> the Effu&s;ion of their Tears on that Occa&s;ion, re&s;embled the pouring forth of Waters: The <HI>Calde</HI> reads it, <HI>they pour'd out their Hearts in Repentance before the Lord;</HI> they wept Rivers of Tears, and &s;orrowed after a godly &s;ort, as in the Pre&s;ence of God, from regard to his Maje&s;ty, and with an Eye to his Glory.</P>
<P>O HOW amiable was this Convention! <HI>O that our Heads were Waters and our Eyes a Fountain of Tears,</HI> that we could with &s;uit|able Contrition this Day bewail our own and others Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es!</P>
<P>WHEN the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John</HI> enquired of JESUS concerning <HI>fa&s;ting;</HI> in his An&s;wer he us'd the term of <HI>mourning</HI> in the room of it, to &s;hew, that the one cannot be acceptably ob&s;erved with|out the other; <HI>why,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>do we and the Phari&s;ees fa&s;t oft, but thy Di&s;ciples fa&s;t not; and</HI> Je&s;us <HI>&s;aid unto them, can the Chil|dren of the Bride-Chamber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them; but the Days will come, when the Bridegroom will be taken from them, and then &s;hall they fa&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In like manner, by a metonimy of the adjunct, <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> is called <HI>weeping,</HI> becau&s;e the latter is a part of the former, <HI>Zec.</HI> vii. 3. <HI>&s;hould I weep in the fifth month, &s;eparating my&s;elf,</HI> i. e. from labour, food and the comforts of life?

An urgent nece&s;&s;ity required their &s;torming Heaven as it were with their <HI>Tears, Sighs,</HI> and <HI>Groans,</HI> and their taking no denial of God! Hence we are told that <HI>the fervent Prayer of the Righteous avail much;</HI> and that Jacob <HI>wre&s;tled with the Angel and prevail'd, for he wept and made Supplications unto him.</HI> The

<P>WITH <HI>Jacob,</HI> who as a Prince had Power with God and with Men, we &s;hould determine not to let <HI>Jehovah</HI> go, <HI>unle&s;s he ble&s;s us.</HI></P>
<P>THE relenting of the <HI>unju&s;t Judge,</HI> &s;tands upon &s;acred Record, as an unan&s;werable Argument of the irri&s;table force of per&s;eve|ring in Prayer; for if he who neither fear'd Gnd nor regarded Man, who was lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Religion and Humanity, was notwith&s;tanding overcome, meerly by the importunity of a nece&s;|&s;itous Supplicant, to grant her reque&s;t. How much more will that God who is Goodne&s;s and Benignity it&s;elf, grant Ble&s;&s;ings to the Indigent, who <HI>pray always and do not faint.</HI></P>
<P>A CRYING Prayer pierces the Heavens. We read not a Word that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;poke, and yet God was mov'd by his <HI>cry,</HI> which con|&s;i&s;ted in vehement De&s;ires, and inutterable Groanings; yet no doubt a Complication of &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;&s;es may even extort vocal Crys. <HI>I cry'd to the Lord with my Voice,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>and he heard me out of his holy Hill.</HI></P>
<P>IT is &s;aid of <HI>Hezekia, that the Lord heard his Prayer, for he had &s;een his Tears.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Back-&s;liding <HI>Ephraim</HI> began to <HI>bemoan</HI> him&s;elf, then were the Bowels of God troubled for him; then did Jehovah de|clare, <HI>that he would &s;urely have Mercy upon him.</HI></P>
<P>AS importunate Supplication is an excellent Mean to obtain the Mercies we need, &s;o it is an encouraging Token that they are near at Hand.</P>

<P>IT is amazing that importunate Devotion &s;hould as it were, conquer and controul Omnipotence! <HI>Ask of me Things to come, and concerning the Works of my Hands Command ye me.</HI> O &s;tupen|duous Conde&s;cention! When we exert the utmo&s;t Strength of our Souls in humble Devotions, and per&s;i&s;t in our Pleadings for needed Mercies, both of a publick and private Nature, drawn from the Glory of God's Name, the Perfections of his Nature, his Promi&s;es and Providences; the&s;e Petitions are like the conti|nual blowing of the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> over the Sacrifices, <HI>for a me|morial before the Lord;</HI> or like the <HI>Watchmen</HI> upon the Walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, who never hold their Peace Day nor Night, and are com|manded not to keep Silence, or give him Re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AN admirable In&s;tance of this Kind, we have in the <HI>Woman</HI> of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who in the mid&s;t of Di&s;couragements from the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> yea and from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, nobly per&s;i&s;ted! The Di&s;ciples wanted her di&s;mi&s;s'd, becau&s;e &s;he troubled them by cry|ing after them; and the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS at fir&s;t an&s;wered her not a Word, and afterwards &s;poke roughly to her, tho' with a Kind Intention, but &s;till &s;he follow'd with increa&s;ing Importunity,

argu'd the Mercy into her Bo&s;om, and obtain'd a high <HI>Encomium</HI> upon her Faith! <HI>Philo&s;ophei he gune,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome,</HI> the Woman Philo&s;ophizes, &s;he di&s;puted the Mercy from the Redeemers Hand. May almighty God teach us all this ble&s;&s;ed Philo&s;ophy for JESUS Sake.</P>
<P><HI>IMPORTUNITY,</HI> my dear Brethren, does not con&s;i&s;t in a Mul|titude of Words, <HI>When ye pray,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>u&s;e not vain Re|petitions, as the Heathen do; for they think to be heard for their much &s;peaking:</HI> but it con&s;i&s;ts in an <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s of Spirit,</HI> to be heard, in a <HI>prudent Choice</HI> of proper <HI>Arguments,</HI> and in a <HI>re&s;olut per&s;i&s;ting</HI> in our <HI>Reque&s;ts,</HI> till they be an&s;wered; <HI>Hear me &s;peedily. O Lord, my Spirit faileth,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>I would order my Cau&s;e before him, and fill my Mouth with Arguments,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Multitude rebuked the <HI>blind Men,</HI> for crying after <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in&s;tead of being di&s;couraged by &s;uch Oppo&s;ition, they cryed the more, &s;aying, <HI>Have Mercy on us O Lord, thou Son of</HI> David, but <HI>Je&s;us had Compa&s;&s;ion on them, and touched their Eyes, and they received Sight.</HI> O, the Depth, the breadth, the Height of the Redeemer's Love!</P>
<P>THE <HI>poor Man</HI> that had a <HI>Pal&s;ey,</HI> who cou'd not get near to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> below, becau&s;e of the Croud, did not give over his At|tempt in di&s;couragement, but &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, and got &s;ome Friends to carry him to the <HI>Roof</HI> of the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> and untile it, and let him down thro' the Roof, into the mid&s;t before <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> no doubt &s;ome of the <HI>Rubbi&s;h</HI> fell down upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Head, or upon the Heads of &s;ome of his Hearers, and interrupted him for a little Space in his Sermon; this Behaviour look'd &s;omewhat rude and unmannerly, yet the dear <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;poke not a Word of Reproof upon this Occa|&s;ion, but on the contrary, encouraged the poor Man, and &s;aid, <HI>be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee!</HI> O, the amazing Kindne&s;s and Conde&s;cen&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t!</HI> Well might it be &s;aid that our <HI>High Prie&s;t is touch'd with the feeling of our Infirmities,</HI> may we not therefore <HI>come with boldne&s;s to the Throne of GOD's Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in Time of need.</HI></P>
<P>BUT why mu&s;t we pray with &s;uch importunity? I an&s;wer, it is nece&s;&s;ary, both on Account of GOD and our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>God's Maje&s;ty</HI> is wrong'd by Sin, and it is but rea&s;onable that this be felt and acknowledged before it be forgiven. Moreover it is a Di&s;grace to <HI>God</HI>'s Mercy, to be a&s;k'd coldly&punc; the Almighty enjoins us to be importunate and urgent, that it may appear by our Groans how we e&s;teem his Grace!</P>
<P>NOR is <HI>importunity</HI> le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect of our&s;elves, for without it we know not how to <HI>value</HI> the <HI>Mercy</HI> of <HI>God</HI> aright, and when the Ca&s;e is &s;o, are we likely to improve it? No! By no means! Tho&s;e that have been once poor, are careful of the Riches they have got by their Indu&s;try, while tho&s;e that are born to Wealth are often carele&s;s and profu&s;e, and therefore the Al|mighty in general, orders it &s;o, that Men &s;hall not obtain Mercy

<P>TWO things make Men importunate, namely a clear View of Danger great and near, and the Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit. When the Di&s;ciples &s;aw that they were like to be drowned, they &s;oon cryed out <HI>Ma&s;ter &s;ave us, we peri&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>BUT to open the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> more di&s;tinctly, it may not be improper very briefly to con&s;ider, the venerable <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>-A&s;&s;embly's De&s;cription of it, which is this, that <Q>It is an of|fering up of our De&s;ires to GOD; for Things agreeable to his Will, in the Name of Chri&s;t, with Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins, and thankful Acknowledgement of his Mercies.</Q></P>
<P>THIS De&s;cription contains the following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Object</HI> of Prayer, the <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> the <HI>Manner,</HI> the <HI>Pro|perties,</HI> the <HI>Parts</HI> of <HI>Prayer:</HI> Each of the&s;e allow me to &s;peak a few Words upon.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> or he to whom we &s;hould offer our Sup|plications is GOD only, for Prayer is a Part of his natural Wor|&s;hip, and therefore it is his peculiar Prerogative; <HI>Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI> It is God alone who knows all his People's Wants, who is pre&s;ent with them in them all, and able to &s;upply them; and hence the <HI>Ninevites</HI> were ju&s;tly enjoined in our Text, to <HI>cry mightily</HI> to God, and to none but him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> or being of <HI>Prayer,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>offering</HI> up our <HI>De&s;ires</HI> to God. Whatever De&s;ires we have after &s;piritual or tem|poral Benefits, yet unle&s;s they be offered or pre&s;ented to God, they can't be call'd Prayers, for Prayer is the Addre&s;s of an indigent Supplicant to his Superior for &s;ome Benefit, which nece&s;&s;arily in|cludes a certain Homage in it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Prayer,</HI> or Things pray'd for, mu&s;t be <HI>agree|able</HI> to God's <HI>revealed Will</HI> of <HI>Precept</HI> or <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> What the Al|mighty has commanded us to ask or promi&s;ed to confer, that and that only we &s;hould ask; and if we do otherwi&s;e, we may expect a repul&s;e; <HI>ye ask and receive not, becau&s;e ye ask ami&s;s,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>James, that ye may con&s;ume it upon your Lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> in the general, is that it be offered in the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t, if ye &s;hall ask any Thing in my Name,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>I will do it.</HI> Now this intends not only our mentioning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in our Supplications, but our entire reliance upon his Merit for the Acceptance of them. It is in him only who <HI>is the Way, the Truth and the Life,</HI> that we have <HI>acce&s;s</HI> to his Father. God is holy and we are &s;inful, both in our Per&s;ons and Performances,
<PB N="33" REF="040518_0033_1015E921BA517568">
and therefore need a <HI>Mediator,</HI> to render them acceptable by the incen&s;e of his Merit.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Properties</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> are the&s;e.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be <HI>Reverent, Behold I have taken upon me, who am but Du&s;t and A&s;hes, to &s;peak to the Lord, O let not the Lord be an|gry,</HI> &s;aid Abraham. <HI>How dreadful is this Place, this is no other then the Hou&s;e of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven,</HI> &s;aid Jacob.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be <HI>humble:</HI> To this purpo&s;e the&s;e Words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> are remarkable, <HI>Lord thou ha&s;t heard the De&s;ire of the Humble, thou wilt prepare their Heart, thou wilt cau&s;e thine Ear to hear.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>Prayer</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>&s;incere,</HI> flowing from the Heart, and <HI>ye &s;hall &s;eek me and find me, when ye &s;hall &s;earch for me with all your Heart,</HI> &s;ayeth God by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, It mu&s;t be <HI>believing; let him ask in Faith</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>James.</HI> But what is that? I An&s;wer, It contains the&s;e Things, <HI>viz.</HI> our <HI>firm Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> that what we ask is agreeable to God's revealed Will, and that God is <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to con|fer it; as likewi&s;e our <HI>entire Dependance</HI> upon his <HI>faithful Word</HI> to this End.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Importunity</HI> that ought to be in <HI>Prayer,</HI> I have before di&s;cour&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>AND undoubtedly as <HI>Prayer</HI> in general, &s;o in particular. The <HI>Prayer</HI> &s;poken of in our Text, includes the&s;e Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> not only <HI>Petition</HI> for the Mercies we need, and the <HI>Deprecation</HI> of the Judgments we fear. But likewi&s;e a humble <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of our Sins, and an Affectionate <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> for Mercies received.</P>
<P>IN the publick Fa&s;ts ob&s;erved in the Time of <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah,</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> there was a particular Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, accompanied with &s;hame and grief.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Ezra</HI> heard of the Sin of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after their return from Captivity, <HI>he &s;at a&s;toni&s;hed until the Evening, and then ro&s;e up, rent his mantle,</HI> and &s;pake to God in this Language, <HI>O my</HI> GOD <HI>I am a&s;hamed and blu&s;h to lift up my Face to thee my God!</HI> To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e &s;peaks <HI>Daniel</HI> upon the like Occa&s;ion, <HI>to us,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>belongeth confu&s;ion of Face!</HI> The unrea&s;onablene&s;s and ingratitude that are in Sin, cau&s;e &s;hame. Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin is nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to our Humiliation for it, as well as Self-Condemnation and Ju&s;tifying of God, whereby he is glorify'd.</P>
<P>AND if no Sorrow for Sin attends our Confe&s;&s;ion of it, the Fa&s;t wants its Beauty, and is like to fail of its De&s;ign. The Scrip|tures inform us, that <HI>a Day of fa&s;ting is to afflict the Soul;</HI> and how can this be effected without Grief and Sorrow? Hence the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that in his private Fa&s;t, <HI>he mourned three full Weeks;</HI> and the Almighty reproved the Jews, that <HI>in the Day of their Fa&s;t they took Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>NOR &s;hould <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> for Mercies received be omitted: For the right Con&s;ideration of Mercy, tends to aggravate Sin, and make our Confe&s;&s;ion of it, and Grief for it, evangelical, <HI>the

Now every one high and low, rich and poor, was enjoyn'd <HI>to turn from his evil Way,</HI> i. e. the Way he loved and was addicted to by Cu&s;tom and Practice.</P>
<P>AND particularly from <HI>the Violence that was in their Hands,</HI> i. e. Let them re&s;tore what they have unju&s;tly taken, and make Reparation for the Wrongs they have done, and let them not any more oppre&s;s tho&s;e they have Power over, or defraud tho&s;e they deal with. Particular mention is made of <HI>Violence,</HI> or of Injury and Rapine, as <HI>Vatabulus, Liveleius, Mercer, Pi&s;cator, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Montanus</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> interpret the Word; becau&s;e tho&s;e Evils were flagrant among the <HI>Ninivites.</HI> That <HI>bloody City,</HI> as the Prophet <HI>Nahum</HI> &s;peaks, <HI>was full of Lies and Robery, the Prey departed not;</HI> and for this e&s;pecially, God was di&s;plea&s;ed and threatned their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>Violence</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>in their Hands,</HI> partly to &s;ignify that it was daily committed by their Hands, which are the In&s;truments of Action; by the Hand Men are wont to take Things by force, and offer Abu&s;e and Injury to &s;uch as re&s;&s;i&s;t them: And partly to &s;ignify, that they kept in <HI>forcible Po&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> what they got by <HI>In|ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Fraud,</HI> and would not re&s;tore it, without which Repen|tance cannot be &s;incere; according to that ju&s;t and ancient Proverb, <HI>(non remittitur precatum, ni&s;i re&s;tituatur ablatum)</HI> the Sin is not pardon'd till the ill gotten Goods be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> both <HI>di&s;tributive</HI> and <HI>commutative,</HI> is not only ami|able in it&s;elf, but the grand Pillar of all &s;ocial Comforts: So its contrary, is one of the mo&s;t malignant and di&s;tructive Evils; that tends not only to di&s;parage human Nature, but utterly to de&s;troy civil Society, and turn the World into an <HI>Acceldema,</HI> a field of De&s;olation and Blood!</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be farther con&s;idered, that unju&s;t Per&s;ons are of|ten di&s;appointed of their De&s;ign; for how artfully &s;oever they may di&s;gui&s;e their management, yet &s;ome unfor&s;een Accident often draws the Curtain, and brings to light the Evils they prac|ticed behind it: This di&s;covery ruins their Reputation, and marrs their future Succe&s;s.</P>

<P>THE <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of appointing &s;aid <HI>Solemnity,</HI> was as the <HI>Procla|mation</HI> expre&s;&s;e&s;s it, <HI>to turn away God's fierce Anger, and prevent their peri&s;hing.</HI> They were threatned with and in great Danger of De&s;truction; there was but a &s;tep between them and ruin: It was therefore high Time to u&s;e proper Means to prevent it, and the&s;e their Rea&s;on taught them, were Fa&s;ting, Mourning, Prayer, and Reformation of Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Motive</HI> that induced them hereto, was &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion they had of the divine Goodne&s;s, <HI>who can tell,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we peri&s;h not.</HI> They could not object again&s;t the equity of God's Judgment, or pretend to appeal to a higher Tribunal, yet they hoped in the divine Mercy, that while they were bewailing their Offences, while they were re&s;olving and endeavouring to alter the Cour&s;e of their evil Conduct towards God and one another, and imploring divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance herein, that <HI>Jehovah</HI> would be plea&s;ed to alter the Cour&s;e of his afflictive Providences towards them, and forbear to execute the threatned Puni&s;hment. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In &s;ome Places of Scripture, <HI>God</HI> is &s;aid <HI>to repent,</HI> and el&s;ewhere it is &s;aid, that <HI>he is not a Man that he &s;hould repent:</HI> The true Meaning hereof is, that God cannot <HI>repent properly</HI> as Men do, who then change their Mind, and are affected with Grief; and no wonder &s;eeing they are &s;hort &s;ighted and imperfect Creatures: But the&s;e Things are incon|&s;i&s;tent with the infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God, the <HI>Immutability, Perfection</HI> and <HI>Felicity</HI> of his <HI>Nature.

<P>AGAIN Sirs, is it a Duty to <HI>fa&s;t</HI> upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions, then &s;uch are to be reproved, who in Place of <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> required of them, give up them&s;elves to all Exce&s;s of <HI>Riot;</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>de|nying</HI> them&s;elves for the Service of GOD, <HI>they make their Belly their GOD.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Almighty is vi&s;iting the World with his Judgements, they &s;corn to own his Government, &s;o far as to humble them&s;elves under his Rebukes, and implore his Mercy, No!

<P>INSTEAD of <HI>Mourning</HI> for the Afflictions of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State, they take up the Tymbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the Sound of the Organ, they &s;end forth their little Ones like a Flock, and their Children</HI> DANCE!</P>
<P>THEY &s;peak in the &s;ordid Language of the licentious <HI>Epicure, let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die;</HI> and as the Prophet laments <HI>in the Day that GOD calls to weeping, to mourning, to boldne&s;s, and to girding with Sackcloth; behold Joy and Glad|ne&s;s, &s;laying of Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Fle&s;h and drinking Wine,&mdash;Surely this Iniquity &s;hall not be purged from you till ye die &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts!</HI></P>

<P><HI>GLUTTONY</HI> is an Enemy to the <HI>Mind,</HI> it &s;tupifies and unfits it, for all the valuable Employments of Rea&s;on, both Civil and Re|ligious; it is the fatal, the formidable Source of the mo&s;t &s;ordid Sen&s;uality, <HI>Nam fine cerere et baccho friget venus:</HI> It pampers the Fle&s;h, and makes it an ea&s;y Prey to every vagrant Lu&s;t: It makes Man's Rea&s;on a Lacky to his Appetite, and thus degrades that once noble Creature into the Order of Bea&s;ts, by inducing him to place his &s;upream Happine&s;s in the Plea&s;ure of a Swine!</P>

them in a way honourable to his Ju&s;tice: By their Ceremonies and Sacrifices they were taught the reality and greatne&s;s of their Di&s;ea&s;e and Danger, and the nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ufficiency of a Remedy without them&s;elves, even in the <HI>Me&s;iah:</HI> And from hence, together with the Prophe&s;ies of the Prophets re&s;pecting him, they were in|duced to believe that he would certainly come in due Time and bring Salvation with him: Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> rejoiced to &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Day, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> valued the Afflictions of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> more than the Trea|&s;ures of <HI>Egypt.</HI> From what has been &s;aid it appears, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> is one e&s;&s;entially; they differ but as the Morning and Evening Star, which is the &s;ame, but is diver&s;ly called from its Appearance before the Sun ri&s;ing and after its &s;etting.

<P>IN &s;peaking upon this Propo&s;ition I would,</P>

<P>NOW the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD, is that eternal <HI>Rectitude</HI> of the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> whereby he orders and di&s;po&s;es all Things, according to the <HI>Rules</HI> that his infinite Wi&s;dom has pre&s;cribed; and governs all Mankind with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s and Impartiality in Relation to the Di&s;tribution of <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments;</HI> to illu&s;trate this we &s;hould ob&s;erve, that there is an intrin&s;ick RECTITUDE and OBLI|QUITY in Things, and that the Rea&s;ons and Relations of moral Good and Evil, do not depend upon any uncertain and arbitrary Principle; but are fixed and immutable, indi&s;pen&s;able, and eter|nal; pur&s;uant to this, that <HI>Truth, Goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> are e&s;&s;en|tial and nece&s;&s;ary Properties, in the divine Nature; antecedent to any Con&s;ideration of the divine Will; and what he can no more alter or un&s;ettle, than he can deny him&s;elf or cea&s;e to be; that as he is the Maker and Governor of the World, he has an undoubt|ed Authority to make <HI>Laws,</HI> and enforce them with proper <HI>Sanc|tious;</HI> that when Laws are thus enacted, he &s;etts Bounds in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to his own Authority; for Ju&s;tice requires that he &s;hould not pre&s;cribe what is above Man's Strength, or if he does, that he &s;hould give &s;upernatural Power to obey it; that upon Obedience he cannot without Prejudice to his Ju&s;tice, deny the promis'd Re|ward, or, upon Di&s;obedience, finally forbear to inflict the threatned Puni&s;hment: And from hence it follows, that GOD is nece&s;&s;arily obliged, both by his Nature and Covenant, to act with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice and Impartiality, in all his Proceedings with Man: But I proceed to the</P>

In order to open this important and FUN|DAMENTAL POINT, of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, and give it its ju&s;t Weight, let me endeavour to repre&s;ent,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> there was of a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice, in order to our <HI>Redemption</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">2. EVINCE the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of that which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has made thereto by his <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Satisfaction to <HI>divine Ju&s;tice</HI> in order to our Redemption and Salvation, appears from the Con&s;ideration of the Nature of GOD, and his Relation to intelligent Creatures</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="040518_0046_1015BE7A15AA7688"><HI>JUSTICE</HI> being a natural and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Perfection</HI> of the di|vine <HI>Nature,</HI> hath con&s;equently an invariable Re&s;pect to the mo|ral Qualities of intelligent <HI>Beings,</HI> as divine Goodne&s;s in &s;ome Degree naturally and nece&s;&s;arily diffu&s;es it&s;elf upon Agents, per|fectly pure and innocent, &s;o likewi&s;e Ju&s;tice terminates upon the Guilty and Nocent by Puni&s;hments equal to their Crimes; except a Satisfaction intervene. If it be impo&s;&s;ible con&s;idering the Per|fection of the Diety that Holine&s;s &s;hould be unrewarded, then &s;urely it mu&s;t be more impo&s;&s;ible that Sin &s;hould be unpuni&s;hed; &s;eeing the Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice is more nece&s;&s;ary than that of Good|ne&s;s; for the Rewards which Goodne&s;s di&s;pen&s;es are pure Favour, ina&s;much as the Creature has received it's Being, and all its Bene|fits from GOD, all the Services it can perform, are due to him on account hereof, and if &s;o, by the Payment of a ju&s;t Debt, they cannot merit fre&s;h Benefits; but the Puni&s;hments which Ju&s;|tice inflicts are due and demerited, for violating the Rights of Heaven, and all the Obligations they are laid under to GOD; &s;eeing <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> in it's Nature is a Perfection, it mu&s;t of Con&s;e|quence be in GOD, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all kinds of Excellency, and that in the highe&s;t Degree of Eminence, or infinitely, and if &s;o it is inflexible and eternal.</P>
<P>SIN is directly contrary to the divine <HI>Purity,</HI> and therefore he mu&s;t as nece&s;&s;arily hate it, as he loves him&s;elf; this is evident from the Law of Contraries, as well as from the P&s;almi&s;t's Ob&s;er|vation, <HI>The righteous Lord loveth Righteoune&s;s, but the Wicked his Soul hateth.</HI> Now <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is but a natural Effect, and pro|per Manife&s;tation of this <HI>Hatred;</HI> and therefore it is not an arbi|trary Con&s;tituion; it is true, the Time and Manner of it's In|fliction is founded in divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> but the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Sub|&s;tance</HI> of it is bottom'd on the e&s;&s;ential <HI>Purity</HI> and Rectitude of the divine <HI>Nature</HI> to which Sin is repugnant.</P>
<P>BUT if together with what has been offered, re&s;pecting the di|vine Nature; we con&s;ider the Relation <HI>Jehovah</HI> bears to the moral World, it adds much Light and Force to this Argument.</P>
<P>ALMIGHTY GOD in the Character of a <HI>Governor,</HI> is obliged to protect the Laws of his Government from Reproach and In|&s;ult.</P>
<P>AS it was proper and nece&s;&s;ary, that the rea&s;onable Creature &s;hould have a <HI>Law</HI> to direct it, in that <HI>Homage</HI> and Service, which it had a Capacity to perform to its Creator and Sovereign.</P>
<P>SO it is highly rea&s;onable that the afore&s;aid <HI>Law</HI> &s;hould be con|firm'd by &s;uch important Sanctions, as were nece&s;&s;ary to procure the Creature's Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>SIN</HI> being the greate&s;t moral <HI>Evil,</HI> becau&s;e oppo&s;ite to the greate&s;t moral <HI>Good</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, it is but &s;uitable that it &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t penal Evil, <HI>viz.</HI> Death.</P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Law</HI> being broken, was it not ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, that the Penalty threatned &s;hould be inflicted, either upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or him&s;elf, according to the immediate Intent of the
<PB N="8" REF="040518_0047_1015E9439F4B42D0">
<HI>Law,</HI> or upon &s;uch a <HI>Surety</HI> in his room, as was able to make Satisfaction equivalent to the Offence; that &s;o the <HI>Maje&s;ty, Pu|rity,</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of GOD might be rendered con&s;picuous, as well as the Value he puts upon Obedience to his <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Penalty threatened be not inflicted, upon a proper Oc|ca&s;ion, does it not reflect either upon his WISDOM, as if he had not with good Rea&s;on concerted the SANCTION, or upon his POWER, as if he was not able to inflict it, or upon his PURITY, as tho' he conniv'd with Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; or upon his TRUTH, in|a&s;much as his Word is not perform'd. And would not Sinners be hereby induced to contemn the Law and the Lawgiver, and en|courag'd in their Impieties? All which Con&s;iderations plainly prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of Satisfaction for the Breach of GOD'S Laws; without this, GOD'S Hatred again&s;t Sin would not be declared, nor the <HI>Honour</HI> of his <HI>Laws</HI> pre&s;erved, nor a &s;uitable <HI>Fear</HI> of offending him awak'd, every of which are nece&s;&s;ary and excellent: It is true, temporal Magi&s;trates are &s;ometimes obliged to di&s;pen&s;e with the Law, and &s;pare an Offender, either thro' inabillity to puni&s;h him, or becau&s;e his Life may be of more Service to the State; and &s;till there is a &s;uperior Tribunal, to which the Ca&s;e either is, or ought to be referred; but GOD'S Government is very different, no Criminal can either e&s;cape his Notice, bya&s;s his Ju&s;tice, or controul his Power; here is no Exigency of Govern|ment that requires Impunity, no &s;uperior <HI>Tribunal:</HI> Moreover the <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> is more &s;acred than that of Civil States and Kingdoms. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to evince the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of that <HI>Satisfac|tion</HI> which CHRIST paid to divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> by his Death. And to this End, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the PREQUISITES in order to it; and the Account the &s;acred Scriptures give of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Death,</HI> together with the CONSEQUENTS thereof.</P>
<P>NOW in order to Satisfaction, the&s;e Things were previou&s;ly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, <HI>viz.</HI> The per&s;onal <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Mediator;</HI> his being <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd</HI> of the divine and human <HI>Natures;</HI> his <HI>Appointment</HI> to undertake this Province, and his <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> thereto.</P>
<P>HE that &s;atisfies for another's Sin mu&s;t be without Sin him&s;elf, for guilty Blood is impure and con&s;equently &s;tains by its Effu&s;ion rather than clean&s;es: Now the Lord JESUS was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;eparate from Sinners, he appeared to take away Sin and in him was no Sin: To prevent his Infection with original Sin propogated by natural Generation, he was conceived in a miracu|lous Manner, by the Power of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> according to the Angel's Declaration, <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the Power of the highe&s;t &s;hall over&s;hadow thee, therefore al&s;o that holy Thing that &s;hall be born of thee &s;hall be called the Son of GOD.</HI> And as he was perfectly free from original, &s;o likewi&s;e from actual Sin; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atan, when he came found nothing in him, to fa&s;ten his Temptation upon; and therefore was baff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in all his Stratagems; tho' he came in the likene&s;s of &s;inful Fle&s;h, yet he had no Sin:
<PB N="9" REF="040518_0048_1015E94721942160">
ju&s;t as the bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en Serpent had the Figure, but not the Venom of the fiery Serpent: Our Lord fulfilled all Righteou&s;nes, and ever did what plea&s;ed his Father.</P>
<P>NAY our Lord was not only free from Sin, but it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be tainted with it, becau&s;e of the intimate Union of his human Nature with the divine; the divine Nature being Holine&s;s it&s;elf, and Almighty Power, mu&s;t needs by its Pre&s;ence and Union infallibly prevent Sin in the Redeemer.</P>
<P>BUT it was not only nece&s;&s;ary that the MEDIATOR &s;hould be per&s;onally holy, in order to make Satisfaction, but likewi&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of the divine and human Natures: He mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the Nature of Man, that he might be ally'd to him, and capable of &s;uffering in his &s;tead, for the Deity cannot &s;uffer. Under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy, the Right of Redemption belong'd to him that was next in Blood; hence our Lord took upon him the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he might have a Right of Propinquity or near Alliance as Man, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">deem us, and be capable to make Satisfaction for us in the &s;ame Nature that &s;inn'd.</P>
<P>NOR was it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary that the MEDIATOR &s;hould be GOD, that &s;o the human Nature might be &s;upported under its Sufferings, and they made of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">finite Value, and &s;o equivalent to the de|merit of Sin. JUSTICE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">equired an exact Proportion between the Guilt of Sin, and the Satisfaction made for it, which could not be, if the <HI>Mediator</HI> had not been <HI>GOD.</HI> The Guilt of Sin is doubtle&s;s infinite, becau&s;e committed again&s;t an infinite GOD, but the Suf|ferings of any finite Nature can be but finite in Mea&s;ure and Va|lue; and there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a Union of the di|vine and human Natures, in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> to com|municate an infinite <HI>Dignity</HI> to his Sufferings: By Rea&s;on of this Union there is a Communication of the &s;pecial Properties of both <HI>Natures</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which being properly the Foun|tain of his Actions, mu&s;t needs communicate an infinite Merit and Dignity to them all, and hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>the Lord of Glory was crucified;</HI> and that we are <HI>purcha&s;ed by the Blood of GOD,</HI> the human Nature being united to the divine, the Actions pro|ceeding from it, are not meerly human, but rais'd above their natural Worth, and therefore meritorious and infinitely excellent: One Hour of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Life glorified GOD, more than Millions of Ages &s;pent in his Service by Men and Angels, becau&s;e this being done by Creatures, can be but finite and limited; but the other being the Obedience of one who is GOD, is of infinite Excellen|cy, and worthy of GOD: <HI>He that</HI> comes from <HI>above, is above all;</HI> the &s;ame may &s;aid of his Sufferings.</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Pre-requi&s;ite</HI> to Satisfaction, is the <HI>Mediators Appoint|ment</HI> to undertake this Province; without this his Mediation would have been in vain, being de&s;titute of &s;ufficient Authority. Now the Scriptures plainly and po&s;itively declare our Lord's Appointment to the mediatorial Work, in the&s;e Words <HI>for him hath GOD the Father &s;ealed,</HI> GOD anointed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth with the Ho|ly
<PB N="10" REF="040518_0049_1015E949322A73F8">
Gho&s;t, and with Power, the Lord hath &s;worn and will not repent, thou art a Prie&s;t forever after the Order of</HI> Melchizedek. <HI>Therefore doth my Father love me, becau&s;e I lay down my Life, this Commandment I have received of my Father.</HI> The&s;e Scriptures and many others that might be mentioned, do &s;ufficiently &s;hew <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Authority and Commi&s;&s;ion to mediate.</P>
<P>GOD the Father in this Con&s;titution, is to be con&s;idered as a Governor, who by an Act of Supremacy and pure Juri&s;diction, may di&s;pen&s;e with the Execution of the Law, upon &s;uch Con&s;i|derations, as fully an&s;wer the Ends of Government.</P>
<P>THE Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for that obliges the Per&s;on that Sins to &s;uffer, and if the Ca&s;e were &s;o no Fle&s;h could be &s;aved; nor is it di&s;annull'd, for if &s;o no Obligation to Duty or Penalty would remain, but all Men are o|bliged to obey, and tho&s;e who impenitently neglect it, are under a Cur&s;e, it is therefore only relax'd in regard of its Penalty, by a merciful Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Lawgiver.</P>
<P>IT is true the <HI>Moral Law</HI> cannot be relaxed, in re&s;pect of its <HI>Precept;</HI> for that being a <HI>Copy</HI> of the divine <HI>Purity,</HI> the Al|mighty cannot deny him&s;elf by contradicting it, or allowing what is intrin&s;ically Evil; nor can it be relaxed in Re&s;pect of the <HI>Sub|&s;tance</HI> and Weight of its Penalty in general, becau&s;e of the <HI>Ju&s;|tice</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD engaged to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame.</P>
<P>YET that the Penalty may be relaxed, as to the Per&s;on of the Sinner, for wi&s;e and ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, is evident by con&s;idering, that it is not the Evil of the Offender, that is primarily de&s;igned by it, But the Honour of the Lawgiver, and the Pre&s;ervation of pub|lick Order and Government; in ca&s;e therefore tho&s;e valuable Ends can be attain'd, by &s;ub&s;tituting a Surety in the Place of the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or to &s;uffer for him; the End of the Law is an&s;wered.</P>
<P>ALTHO' the Threatning declared the Demerit of Sin in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and the Right of Puni&s;hing in the Creator and So|vereign, yet it cannot vacate GOD'S Power to relax it upon ju&s;t and wi&s;e Rea&s;ons; otherwi&s;e it would be ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent with his Supremacy.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t <HI>Pre-requi&s;ite</HI> that I mentioned, was the REDEEMERS <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to the Fathers Appointment; this was nece&s;&s;ary to make his Sufferings &s;atisfactory; for being GOD him&s;elf he could not be compelled by any &s;uperior Authority; its true, after he had undertaken, he was then obliged to pay the Debt; but his fir&s;t Engagement was altogether free and of Choice.</P>
<P>AND &s;eeing that the <HI>Vertue</HI> of his Sufferings does not ari&s;e meerly from the Dignity of his Per&s;on, but from his Sub&s;titution in our &s;tead, this rendered his Con&s;ent likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary; his &s;uf|ferings for others without his Con&s;ent, if he could have been com|pell'd thereto, would have been liable to the Charge of Inju&s;tice; and therefore the Scriptures expre&s;sly declare his willingne&s;s to undertake the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mediation, Burnt-offering, and Sin-offer|ing thou did&s;t not require, <HI>then &s;aid I, lo I come, in the Volumn

<P>NOW having &s;poken of the Pre-requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary in order to Satisfaction; it is proper to di&s;cour&s;e on the Account which the Scriptures give of the Redeemer's Death, to the End we may know whether it was &s;atisfactory or not, and to &s;hew how divine Ju&s;tice is therein glorified. Now the Scriptures repre&s;ent the Death of CHRIST under a threefold Character, <HI>viz.</HI> as a Puni&s;hment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and as a Sacrifice to reconcile us to God. And</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is repre&s;ented as a Puni&s;hment for Sin, this will appear by con&s;idering.</P>
<P>THAT Man on account of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, was &s;entenced by the Law he broke to Death; and being in&s;olvent, the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> by his Father's Appointment and his own Con&s;ent, engaged as a Surety to pay the Debt; and hence he is call'd the Surety of a better Covenant, and he is &s;aid to be made under the Law, that we might obtain the Adoption of Sons; he who was God over all ble&s;&s;ed forever, was in re&s;pect of his human Nature, and as Mediator, &s;ubject to its Precepts, and liable to its Penalties, that by performing the one and &s;u&s;taining the other, he might redeem tho&s;e that were under the Law.</P>
<P>THE Debt we ow'd was not pecuniary but penal, a Creditor may forgive the former without Payment, becau&s;e it is his Pro|perty, but the latter cannot be forgiven without the Prince's Con|&s;ent, who is Guardian of the <HI>Laws,</HI> becau&s;e publick Ju&s;tice is concerned in it.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST having a&s;&s;um'd the Relation of a SURETY, be|came one with the Debtor, in the Judgment of the <HI>Law;</HI> and &s;o was liable to their Puni&s;hment according to <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>AND this Puni&s;hment the Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, GOD as a &s;u|preame Judge inflicted upon him; and hence he is &s;aid to be deli|vered up by the Determinate Council of GOD, and that the Lord laid upon him the Iniquities of us all, that is the Guilt of them, and Puni&s;hment due for them. It is farther &s;aid, that it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, and el&s;ewhere that the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> was cut of but not for him&s;elf, that he was wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, bruis'd for our Iniquities, that the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace was laid upon him, and that by his Stripes we are heal'd; that he him&s;elf bare our Sins on his own Body on the Tree. Moreover the Sufferings CHRIST endur'd, were an&s;werable to the Penalty the Law de|nounc'd, in Sub&s;tance, the Death threatn'd was both Temporal and Spiritual, and thus our Lord, not only bore a Temporal Death, accompanied with great Di&s;honour, and exqui&s;ite Angui&s;h, but likewi&s;e with the Cur&s;e of GOD, and he al&s;o bore the Wrath of

<HI>Jehovah</HI> upon his Soul, and hence he is &s;aid to <HI>tread the Wine Pre&s;s of it alone:</HI>&mdash; The FEAR and SORROW of CHRIST at the approach of his Sufferings as well as his BLOODY SWEAT and Lamentation under them, &s;hew'd that he endur'd &s;omething more terrible then all outward Torments, for the Martyrs have en|dur'd &s;uch with triumph, and &s;urely our Redeemer co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not have le&s;s courage then they, who was the Source of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r For|titude; the Difference then mu&s;t be in the Nature of their Suf|ferings, GOD the Father dealt with him as our SURETY, and not as his own SON; and therefore &s;u&s;pended a comfortable Sen&s;e of his Love, and appear'd as a &s;evere inexorable Judge: Now from the afore&s;aid Account of the Sufferings of CHRIST, it is evident they were PENAL; &s;eeing they were inflicted for Sin by the Supreme Judge, and were equivalent to the Sentence of the Law, and we receive &s;piritual and &s;pecial Benefits by them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Chri&s;t's Sufferings</HI> we may ob&s;erve the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> of Puni&s;hment. The <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is &s;omething afflic|tive, either privative in being deprived of &s;ome good, or po&s;itive in enduring &s;omething grievous, both which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bore. The <HI>form</HI> of Puni&s;hment is when it is Inflicted for Sin, and this di&s;tingui&s;hes it from a Calamity. Now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;uffer'd Death for Sin not his own, and hence he is &s;aid to bear our Sins, to be delivered up to Death for our Sins, yea, to be made Sin and a Cur&s;e for US. The <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is the common good, partly in deterring Per&s;ons from violating the Laws, which is the de&s;ign of exemplary Puni&s;hment, and partly in maintaining the Honour and Intere&s;t of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by the Breach of the Laws, this is the De&s;ign of Sa|tisfactory Puni&s;hment, an&s;werable to which in the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Severity there expre&s;s'd is to deter from Sin, and maintain the Honour of the great Lord of the Univer&s;e, by making com|pen&s;ation for the Injury done again&s;t him by Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THE DEATH of CHRIST is repre&s;ented in Scripture as the PRICE of our <HI>Redemption: Redemption</HI> in general is a deliver|ing of one from a Calamity by a <HI>Ran&s;om, i. e.</HI> Some valuable Con&s;ideration, which is term'd a Price; to under&s;tand which let it be con&s;idered, that Man by Di&s;obedience to GOD was bro't into Mi&s;ery, &s;uch Mi&s;ery as the Scripture often expre&s;&s;es by Captivity, which con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ervile Subjection to Satan and Death, to which Man was as it were committed for his Rebellion by the Supreame Judge and Governor; from this Calamity Men could no otherwi&s;e be delivered then by Ran&s;om, for by Order of Divine Ju&s;tice we were detain'd Pri&s;oners, and till this was Satisfy'd, no Di&s;charge could be obtain'd; freedom from a Calamity without a Price is Deliverance &s;imply, but not properly Redemption: The Word Re|demption to which the Scriptures a&s;cribe our e&s;cape <HI>(apolutro&s;is)</HI> &s;ignifies Deliverance by a Ran&s;om; and hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that CHRIST gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, (antilutron)</HI> This Word is exceeding Emphatical, and &s;ignifies a Ran&s;om paid in&s;tead of another. <HI>Anti</HI> denotes Sub&s;titution, when a Thing or

Per&s;on is put in the Place of another; many In&s;tances might ea&s;ily be given of this, &s;o that the Meaning of the afore&s;aid Words, he gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;on for many, is this, that he died in their &s;tead, and by his Life as a Price obtained their Redemption; which Truth the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> el&s;ewhere confirms, by &s;aying that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has Redeem'd us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us; the Price upon Con&s;ideration of which we are Redeem'd, <HI>is not corruptable Things &s;uch as Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of CHRIST as of a Lamb without Blemi&s;h and without Spot,</HI> this Price was paid in our &s;tead to GOD, for it was for Sin again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, that we were ca&s;t into Mi&s;ery, and by his Righteous Order detained in it; and therefore to him the Price of our acquitance mu&s;t be paid; Satan is no more then an In|&s;trument of his Ju&s;tice: If CHRIST had died only for the Confirmation of the Go&s;pel, or to exhibit to us a Patern of Suffering, as the <HI>Socinians</HI> imagine, then what was there in his Death more than in the Death of other Martyrs, and how can we be &s;aid to be <HI>redeem'd</HI> by it? Would it not be as ridiculous as bla&s;phemous to &s;ay, that we are redeemed by their Death? But</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented in Scripture, as a Sacri|fice to reconcile us to God; him Jehovah <HI>has &s;et forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was a true and real <HI>Sacrifice</HI> appears not only from the expre&s;s Declaration of Scripture, but from all the Ingredients of a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> being found in it, Chri&s;t <HI>our Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians, is &s;acrificed for us;</HI> and in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> he informs us, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath appeared once in the End of the World to put away Sin by the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ONE <HI>Ingredient</HI> of a real and proper <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> was that the Per|&s;on offering mu&s;t be a Prie&s;t, <HI>every high Prie&s;t,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>taken from among Men is ordained for Men in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins;</HI> and was not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> con&s;titued a Prie&s;t by Oath after the Order of <HI>Melchizedeck.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, The Things offered were to be of God's appointment, otherwi&s;e it was but Will-wor&s;hip, even in freewill Offerings, tho' the Time of Offering was not fixed, yet the Things to be Offered were appointed; and thus was not what CHRIST offered, appointed and prepared by God, <HI>a Body ha&s;t thou prepared me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t; this Body was animated with a Soul, which being &s;e|parated therefrom in his Death, is &s;aid to be <HI>made an Offering for Sin,</HI> by the Royal Prophet; and el&s;ewhere he is &s;aid to <HI>offer him|&s;elf,</HI> i. e. both his Soul and Body, (<HI>Heb.</HI> ix.)</P>
<P>FARTHER, that which was offered for a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> was to be de|&s;troy'd; tho&s;e Things that had life were kill'd, and their Blood pour'd out, and the other Parts be&s;ides the Blood were burnt, either wholy or in part: Thus our Lord was &s;lain and his Blood &s;hed, and his Soul was expo&s;ed to his Fathers Wrath. And as the Jewi&s;h <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were burnt without the Camp: Thus did not JESUS &s;uffer <HI>without the Gates of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Moreover,
<PB N="14" REF="040518_0053_1015E951D9EB96F0">
<HI>Sacrifices</HI> were offered to God only, and hence the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> terms t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m <HI>Things pertaining to God:</HI> And did not JESUS CHRIST, thro the eternal Spirit, offer him&s;elf <HI>without Spot to God, (Heb,</HI> ix. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.)</P>
<P>FROM the afore&s;aid Particulars it appears, that all the <HI>Ingredients</HI> or <HI>Con&s;tituents,</HI> of a real <HI>Sacrifice</HI> are found in the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING already &s;hewn that CHRIST'S Death was a <HI>real Sacri|fice,</HI> I would proceed to a&s;&s;ert and prove, that it was a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Propitiation</HI> or <HI>Attonement</HI> and <HI>Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>TO this End ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Propitiatory Sacrifices</HI> under the Jewi&s;h OEconomy, were figures and &s;hadows of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Now if the Types and Shadows had any propitiatory Vertue in them, much more the Antitype, el&s;e the Sub&s;tance would not exceed the Shadow, which is ab&s;urd. That the Jewi&s;h <HI>Sacri|fices</HI> did prefigure the Death of Chri&s;t, the Apo&s;tle declares at large in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and in the &s;econd Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Colo&s;ians,</HI> where he calls them <HI>Figures and Shadows of good Things to come:</HI> but in the mean Time ob|&s;erves, that <HI>the Body is of</HI> Chri&s;t; as if he &s;hould &s;ay, tho&s;e Propitiatory Jewi&s;h Sacrifices had &s;ome re&s;emblance of this, as the &s;hadow has of the Body, tho' ob&s;cure and imperfect; but the Sub&s;tance and Perfection of Atonement is in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to make this very important Point more evident, let me endeavour to prove, that all that was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Propitiation under the Jewi&s;h OEconomy, is to be found in the Sacrifice of Chri&s;t, <HI>e. g.</HI> The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, and likewi&s;e his Puni&s;hment was inflicted upon it, the Sacrifice was &s;ub&s;tituted in his Room, apea&s;ed the Almighty, and removed the Sinners guilt.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e Particulars de&s;erves and requires our Attention. The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, or imputed to it and charged upon it, &s;o as to be made re&s;pon&s;ible and liable to &s;uffer for it, as if it had contracted the Guilt it&s;elf; even as a Surety is obliged to pay a Debt he never contracted, yea as much as if he had: The <HI>Sacrifice</HI> was look'd upon and treated as a guilty Thing, tho' it had not fin'd it&s;elf; hence the&s;e <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were called <HI>Sins, (Levit.</HI> xx. 17) which is tran&s;lated <HI>Sin-Offering.</HI> Farther they are &s;aid to bear the Iniquities of the People, (<HI>Levit.</HI> xvi. 22.) <HI>and the Goat &s;hall bear upon him all their Iniquities.</HI> We are farther informed in the afore&s;aid Chapter, that the People laid their Hands upon the Head of the Sacrifice, confe&s;&s;ed their Sins over him, and put their Sins upon him; <HI>and</HI> Aaron <HI>&s;hall lay both his Hands upon the Head of the live Goat, and confe&s;s over him all the Iniquities of the Children of I&s;rael.</HI> Putting them upon the Head of the Goat, &s;ignified, &s;ay the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Ma&s;ters, that the Guilt was transferred from the People to the Sacrifice that was offered for them. And hence the Scape Goat, and other Propitiatory Sacrifices, were look'd upon as execrable and poluted Things; and tho&s;e that touch'd them were po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted. (<HI>Levit.</HI> xxvi.)
<PB N="15" REF="040518_0054_1015E954A08F76E8">
Now as the Sin was charged upon and imputed to the legal Sacri|fices, &s;o our Sins were charged upon and imputed to JESUS CHRIST, as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves to the <HI>Corinthians, he was made Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> How could he be made Sin who knew none, any other way than by Imputation? And how can his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who is God, be made ours by any other Method? Sin was imputed to Chri&s;t when it was charged upon him, and he obliged to &s;uffer for it in our &s;tead; as a Debt may be &s;aid to be imputed to a Surety when he takes it upon him&s;elf, and is thereby obliged to pay it, tho' he never contracted it; and <HI>Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is imputed to us when it is accepted for us, and we as realy entitled to its Bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as tho' we had perform'd it.

<P>THE <HI>Penalty</HI> of the Offender was laid upon the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d for him; the Sinner de&s;erved temporal Death and De&s;truction, and the Sacrifice was &s;lain or de&s;troy'd. A Bullock which was a Sin-Offerring for the High-Prie&s;t, and a Goat, which was a Sin-Offering for the People, were ordered to be killed, and the Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Goat was &s;ent into the Wilderne&s;s to be de&s;troy'd one way or other. (<HI>See Levit.</HI> xvi) And in like manner the Sin-Offerings for private Per&s;ons whether Lambs, Kids, Turtle-Doves, or Young Pidegons, were to be &s;lain, and the Offering of Flour was to be partly con|&s;umed. (<HI>Levit.</HI> v.)</P>
<P>THE Sacrifices, by having the Sins of the People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid upon them, became liable to the Penalty, and did actually under go it: Thus it was with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> whom they pointed to; <HI>he him&s;elf,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter, bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, by who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed; he was brui&s;ed for our Iniquities,</HI> &s;aith the Prophet, <HI>wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and poured out his Soul unto Death.</HI> Farther,</P>
<P>THE Sacrifice &s;uffered the afore&s;aid Penalties in the Offenders room and place, and this indeed nece&s;&s;arily follows from the Par|ticulars beforementioned, for to &s;uffer in one's &s;tead is nothing el&s;e but to &s;uffer for another what he &s;hould have &s;uffered, that he may e&s;cape; thus the Sacrifice &s;uffered Death for the Offender that he might not die, and therefore dy'd in his &s;tead, its Life went for his Life, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 11. <HI>For the Life of the Fle&s;h is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make an Atonement.</HI> The Blood being the Vehickle of Life, when it goes, the Life goes; this therefore being offered to attone for them, or &s;ave their Lives, of Con&s;equence the Life of the Sa|crifice went in&s;tead of the Life of the Offender.</P>
<P>AND if, as has been before proved, both the Sin and Puni&s;h|ment of the Offender were laid upon the Sacrifice, it mu&s;t needs &s;uffer in his room and place; but for farther Illu&s;tration of this important Point of the Sub&s;titution of the Sacrifice in the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors room, it may be ob&s;erved, that no Sacrifices were in&s;tituted for Capital Offences, &s;uch as Murder, Idolatry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e the Sinner him&s;elf was to be cut off; but for other Sins which tho'
<PB N="16" REF="040518_0055_1015E958734628E0">
they in &s;trictne&s;s according to that Di&s;pen&s;ation, de&s;erved Death, yet God was plea&s;ed to relax the Penalty of the Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Re&s;pect of the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and accept of the Life of the Sacrifice for his Life: Agreeable hereto the guilty Per&s;on was to offer a clean Bea&s;t of his own, to &s;ignify its Sub&s;titution in his &s;tead, for as Proprietor he had a Dominion over it to apply it to that U&s;e.</P>
<P>WELL, if there was in the Sacrifices of Attonement a Sub&s;ti|tution of the Sacrifice in the Offender's room, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;uch a Sacrifice as has been proved, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows that he died not only for our Good, but in our room and place, &s;eeing he is the Sub&s;tance and Anti-type to which tho&s;e Shadows pointed, and in whom they have their Accompli&s;hment, and hence he is &s;aid <HI>to die for the Ungodly,</HI> and to &s;uffer the ju&s;t for the un|ju&s;t that he might bring us to GOD, ju&s;t as the innocent Sacri|fice in the room of the guilty Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, not only the original Words in tho&s;e Scriptures <HI>Huper</HI> and <HI>Anti,</HI> but the Things &s;poken of manife&s;tly declare a Sub&s;titution of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Place of Sinners as a Sacrifice of Propitiation.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>propitiatory Sacrifices</HI> were to appea&s;e God and turn away his Anger, this is the Meaning of the Word <HI>Attonement,</HI> which was the De&s;ign of the <HI>Sin-Offerings,</HI> the <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;s-Offerings,</HI> and the <HI>Burnt-Offerings,</HI> Levit. vii. 7. and i. 4. <HI>And he &s;hall put his Hand upon the Head of the Burnt-Offering, and it &s;hall be accepted for him to make Attonement for him.</HI> And this was al&s;o the De&s;ign of the <HI>Peace-Offerings,</HI> and this End tho&s;e Sacri|fices attained, many Examples of this Kind might be offered but I &s;hall only, for brevity's &s;ake, mention one, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. ult. <HI>And</HI> David <HI>offered Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings, &s;o the Lord was intreated for the Land, and the Plague was &s;tayed from</HI> I&s;rael.

<P>NOW the &s;ame Words and Effects are a&s;cribed to the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (or to his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> which is the &s;ame) in our Text he is &s;aid to be a <HI>Propitiatory thro' Faith in his Blood,</HI> by him, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Romans, we have received the At|tonement, Rom.</HI> xi.

<P>ONCE more I may ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sacrifices removed Guilt or Obligation to Puni&s;hment, here ob&s;erve, that Guilt may be &s;aid to be threefold, <HI>viz.

<P>CEREMONIAL Guilt con&s;i&s;ted in an Obligation to be debarr'd from the Privileges of publick Wor&s;hip under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oecono|my for &s;ome Breach of the ceremonial <HI>Law,</HI> for &s;ome legal Pol|lution, <HI>Levit.</HI> 5. But,</P>
<P>MORAL <HI>Guilt</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in an Obligation to endure eternal Death for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the <HI>moral Law,</HI> for by divine Con&s;titution the Wa|ges of every moral Evil or Sin properly and intrin&s;ically &s;o call'd is Death; now the legal Sacrifices could free from the two former Kinds of <HI>Guilt,</HI> but the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone from the latter, <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 13, 14. <HI>For if the Blood of Goats, and A&s;hes of a Hei&s;er &s;prinkling of the Unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the Fle&s;h,</HI> i. e. promoted an external Sanctification or Expiation, as to the Fle&s;h, not as to the Soul and Con&s;cience, <HI>How much more &s;hall the Blood of</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>purge your Con&s;ciences from dead Works.</HI></P>
<P>THE legal Sacrifices could not make him that did the Service, perfect, as pertaining to the Con&s;cience, becau&s;e they could not compen&s;ate the Injury Sin had done to GOD, being finite, without which, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is engaged to puni&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or with eternal Death.</P>
<P>THESE Sacrifices could only remove a civil and ceremonial <HI>Guilt,</HI> or liablene&s;s to outward Puni&s;hment enacted by tho&s;e Laws, (in In&s;tances not grounded upon the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, but meerly upon divine Sovereignity;) and &s;hadow forth the Sacri|fice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which being of infinite Value is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice, remove the Guilt of moral Impurity, and &s;ave the Soul: Under the Law we are told, <HI>that without the &s;hedding of Blood there was no remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> and the Blood is &s;aid to make Attonement, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii 11. the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the Life was in the Blood, and therefore when the Blood was offered to make Attonement for the Offender, the Life of the Sacrifice was &s;uppos'd to be given in&s;tead of his Life, and thus the Sentence of the Law threatning Death was executed, and &s;o <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> &s;atisfied. For this Rea&s;on the Blood of the Mediator is &s;aid to <HI>&s;peak better Things than the Blood of</HI> Abel, for that cry'd for Revenge, but this procures Remi&s;&s;ion to Believers; and this doubtle&s;s is the Rea&s;on why &s;o frequent mention is made of the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in

the <HI>New-Te&s;tament, viz.</HI> to &s;hew that our dear Redeemer has en|dured the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the Law, Death it&s;elf, and thereby &s;atisfied <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> magnified the <HI>Law,</HI> and made it honourable.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice appears, not only from what has been &s;aid upon the &s;criptural Repre&s;entation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Death as a Puni&s;hment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and a Sacrifice to reconcile us to GOD, but likewi&s;e from the Con&s;ideration of the Quality of the Per&s;on &s;uffering, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Effects of them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Quality</HI> of his Per&s;on derived an infinite Value upon his Sufferings. Our Redeemer was the true and eternal GOD, co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, <HI>the Brightne&s;s of his Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> the Son of GOD, not meerly by Office, but by Nature, and therefore was able to make full Sa|tisfaction for our <HI>Sins.</HI> The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of all Nations agree that Puni&s;hments receive their E&s;timate from the Quality of the Per&s;ons that &s;uffer: Tho' the Deity is impa&s;&s;ible, yet it was a divine Per&s;on that &s;uffered, and hence his Blood is call'd the <HI>Blood of GOD,</HI> in Scripture, this made his Sufferings of infinite Worth.</P>
<P>NOR was there any Defect in the Payment he made, we ow'd a Debt of <HI>Death</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> and his <HI>Life</HI> was offered up as a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> yea, <HI>he trod the Wine-pre&s;s of his Father's Anger,</HI> and his divine Nature communicated an infinite Dignity to his Suffer|ings, &s;o that they were in Kind, Degree, and Value, &s;uited to the Sentence of the violated <HI>Law,</HI> equal to the Demerit of <HI>Sin,</HI> and con&s;equently &s;atisfactory to divine <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> provoked by it.</P>
<P>BUT methink, the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Con&s;equents</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Death pours more Light upon this important Subject, and clearly proves the &s;ufficiency of his Satisfaction to <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>NOW there are the&s;e three Con&s;equences of his Death that de&s;erve our pre&s;ent A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Grave, his <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> into Heaven, and <HI>Exaltation</HI> to the Father's Right Hand.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, in Quality of our <HI>Surety,</HI> was arre&s;ted by <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and detain'd as Pri&s;oner in the Grave, till he had by his Death &s;atisfied the <HI>Law</HI> and paid our Debt; upon which he received a Di&s;charge in his <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> and hence the rai&s;ing of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a&s;cribed to GOD as reconciled, <HI>Now the God of Peace, who brought again from the Dead the great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everla&s;ting Covenant;</HI> be&s;ides it is a&s;cribed to his Blood becau&s;e that was the full Price of his and our Liberty. <HI>Ju&s;tice incen&s;ed</HI> arre&s;ted and &s;lew him, but <HI>Ju&s;tice &s;atisfied</HI> gave him a Relea&s;e and Acquittance, of which his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> is a clear Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> having ri&s;en from the Dead, a&s;cended into Heaven as our High Prie&s;t, there to interceed for us: Now his Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven, after he had undertaken to be our <HI>Surety,</HI> is a full and certain Proof that he has faithfully di&s;charged that

important Tru&s;t, this is doubtle&s;s the Meaning of the&s;e Words of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> John xvi. 10.

<P>AFTER the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> had offered Sacrifices without at the Altar, for the Sins of the People, he opened the Vail and entered into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> and there offered &s;weet Incen&s;e and the Blood of Sacrifices to render GOD propitious to them, (<HI>Levit.</HI> xvi. 14, 15.) The&s;e Things were Figures of what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to perform, the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> was a Type of the third Heaven, as that had a double Vail which &s;eparated it from the inner Temple, and the outward Court, &s;o is the third Heaven &s;eparated from the Earth by the double Vail of the &s;tarry Heavens and airy Regions, none that was impure might enter into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> and into Heaven, we are told that <HI>no unclean Thing can enter;</HI> there was the Throne of GOD, for as the P&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves, <HI>He dwells between the Cherubims,</HI> there the Tables of the Law, the Em|blems of divine Wi&s;dom and Purity, there the Cherubims the Figures of the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, there the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> entered with the Blood of the Sacrifice, carrying the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his <HI>Brea&s;t-plate.</HI></P>
<P>THUS our great <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> after having by the Sacrifice of him|&s;elf without the Gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> a toned for the Sins of his People, entered into the eternal Sanctuary with his own Blood, <HI>bearing on his Bo&s;om the Names of all the redeem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heaven for them in their Names, and there offering their Supplications to his Father, perfumed with the Incen&s;e of his Merits. Of this there was a miraculous &s;ign given at his <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> for in the Moment he expired, <HI>the Vail of the Tem|ple was rent from the Top to the Bottom,</HI> to &s;ignify that the great <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> had Authority to enter into Heaven it&s;elf as our Surety, and that his De&s;ign herein was to appear in the Pre&s;ence of God for us as the Lamb &s;lain, (<HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 24.)</P>
<P>AS our LORD purcha&s;ed <HI>Salvation</HI> for us, by the real Sacrifice of him&s;elf upon the Earth, &s;o he applies it to us by his Interce&s;|&s;ion in Heaven, which is a Commemoration of that Sacrifice; and therefore he is &s;aid to appear before his Father by <HI>Sacrifice. (Heb.</HI> ix.)</P>
<P><HI>IF any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>the Righteous.</HI> His <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> is attended with Maje&s;ty and Efficacy: He does not now &s;upplicate with <HI>&s;trong crying and tears,</HI> as in the Days of his Fle&s;h, but <HI>Wills</HI> Salvation to his People, <HI>Father I will that tho&s;e thou ha&s;t given me be with me, that they may behold my Glory.</HI> Nor does his Suit ever fail of <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> for it is ju&s;t, he asks nothing but what he has bought by Blood.

inexpre&s;&s;ible Intere&s;t in his Affection; and hence we are told, that <HI>him the Father heareth always.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, the pre&s;ent <HI>Exaltation</HI> of our <HI>Redeemer</HI> to the highe&s;t Degree of Dignity, Glory and Dominion, is a certain Argument of the &s;ufficiency of his <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice by his obedient Suf|ferings, becau&s;e it was promi&s;ed to and conferred upon him by his Father as a Reward the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>THAT he is now advanced to the highe&s;t <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Dominion,</HI> is evident from the&s;e Scriptures, (Ephe&s;. i.) <HI>When he rai&s;ed him from the Dead, and &s;et him at his own right Hand in heavenly Places, far above all principality and Power, and Might and Do|minion; and every Name that is named, not only in this World but al&s;o in that which is to come, and hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the Father promi&s;ed to him, as <HI>Mediator,</HI> the afore&s;aid Dignities as a Reward, and con&s;equent of his Humiliation, is like|wi&s;e evident from the&s;e Places of Scripture, (<HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 26.) <HI>Ought not</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>to have &s;uffered and to enter into his Glory:</HI> This doubtle&s;s refers to the Covenant of Redemption between the Fa|ther and the Son, before all Worlds, wherein the Son engaged to &s;uffer for Sinners, and the Father promi&s;ed to reward him for it; for without Reference had hereto, there was no Obligation either upon the Father or the Son in the&s;e re&s;pects, See al&s;o <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 8.9. <HI>He humbled him&s;elf and became obedient unto Death; wherefore God hath al&s;o highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is a|bove every Name, that at the Name of</HI> Je&s;us <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow.</HI> Heb. i. 3. <HI>When he had by him&s;elf purged our Sins, he &s;at down on the right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on high.</HI></P>
<P>NOW &s;eeing the afore&s;aid Exaltation, of being Head of the Church, and Lord of the Univer&s;e, was promi&s;ed to the <HI>Mediator</HI> as a Reward and Con&s;equent of his Sufferings and Satisfaction; fora&s;much as it is di&s;pen&s;ed, it is a &s;ufficient Proof that the Con|dition is perform'd, on which the Promi&s;e was &s;u&s;pended, or in other Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, of the certainty and &s;ufficiency of CHRIST'S Satis|faction to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Death, are likewi&s;e Evidences of his <HI>Satisfaction</HI> by it, and therefore give farther force to this Argu|ment. The Law made nothing Perfect, all it's Sacrifices and Ce|remonies could not cancel the Guilt, or clean&s;e the &s;tain of moral Impurity, nor open Heaven for us, all which are nece&s;&s;ary to our Perfection. But CHRIST <HI>by one Offering hath perfected forever them that are &s;anctified;</HI> he hath acquired for his People, acquit|ance from the Guilt of Sin, deliverance from its Stain and Domi|nion, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al Admi&s;&s;ion into the Imperial Paradi&s;e</P>
<P>The Death of JESUS has blotted out the Hand-Writing of Or|dinances which was contrary to us, and took it out of the Way, nailing it to his Cro&s;s <HI>i. e.</HI> entirely cancelled the condemnatory Sentence of the Law as to Believers; for in the afore&s;aid Terms there is a manife&s;t allu&s;ion to the Defacing and De&s;truction of
<PB N="21" REF="040518_0060_1015E963F981B5D0">
obligatory Bonds. In the End of the World our great high Prie&s;t appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf; <HI>his Blood clean&s;eth from all Sin,</HI> and not only extends its Efficacy to all Time pa&s;t, but will to all Time coming; and hence he is &s;aid <HI>to be the &s;ame Ye&s;terday to-day and forever, able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to the Father by him.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is the Death of CHRIST le&s;s efficacious in removing the Dominion and Stain of Sin, for by it the &s;anctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit are procured, <HI>whereby we are renewed after the Image of God, and made meet for Communion with him;</HI> hence it was that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> promi&s;ed the <HI>Comforter</HI> as a con&s;equent of his A&s;cen&s;ion. (<HI>John</HI> xvi.) Hence we are &s;aid <HI>to be &s;anctifyed in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and <HI>to have our Robes made white in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> (Rev. vii. 14.)</P>
<P>AND is it not thro' the <HI>Blood of</HI> CHRIST <HI>that we have bold|ne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t?</HI> (Heb. x. 19) Which is a clear E|vidence of the compleat <HI>Satisfaction</HI> made by it: For without this, Ju&s;tice would never &s;uffer the Privilege of the Righteous to be confered on the guilty and depraved. To this very Purpo&s;e the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf argues, (Heb. v. 9.) <HI>He learned Obedience by the Things which he &s;uffered, and being made Perfect, be became the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</HI> The meaning of which is, that there was Obedience to the Fathers ap|pointment in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Sufferings, and that after he had perfected the End de&s;igned by them, which was <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice, he became the Author of Happine&s;s to all that are believingly &s;ub|ject to his Government and Authority.</P>
<P>Having gone thro' the Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e propos'd; give me leave, becau&s;e of the inexpre&s;&s;ible moment of this Subject, before I proceed to the Improvement, to offer a brief An&s;wer to the prin|cipal Objections that are made again&s;t the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Socinians</HI> object, that it is a Violation of Ju&s;tice to tran&s;|fer the Puni&s;hment of one to another.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is &s;o in &s;ome Ca&s;es, but not in all, <HI>e. g.</HI> When the Per&s;on puni&s;hed has not Power to di&s;po&s;e of his Life, does not con&s;ent to the Puni&s;hment, and no valuable End can be an&s;wered by it, then it is no doubt unju&s;t to transfer the Puni&s;hment upon him. But on the Contrary, when he has Power to di&s;po&s;e of his Life, con&s;ents thereto, and a valuable End can be an&s;wered thereby, it is not unju&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW every of the&s;e Things are applicable to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He had full Power to di&s;po&s;e of his Life, and freely con&s;ented to his Death, (<HI>John</HI> x. 18.) <HI>I lay down my life, no Man taketh it from me, I have Power to lay it down and Power to take it again;</HI> nor was it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be held under the Power of Death, (<HI>Act.</HI> ii. 24.) otherwi&s;e no doubt it would have been unrea&s;on|able for &s;uch a one as he to endure it, for worthle&s;s rebels.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, an infinite Good re&s;ults from his Death; God is hereby glorified, and guilty Sinners &s;aved, and the great Ends of Government an&s;wered.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="040518_0061_1015E9674C231610">JUSTICE is no di&s;orderly Appetite, that aims principally at the Ruin of the Guilty, and is di&s;&s;atisfied without it. No, it pre|&s;erves Right with pure Affections, and is therefore content when the Injury is repaired, from whom&s;oever Satisfaction comes.</P>
<P>THO' an Inocent Per&s;on cannot &s;uffer as Inocent, without In|ju&s;tice; yet he may contract an Obligation which will expo&s;e him to de&s;erved Sufferings. The Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of all Nations agree in puni&s;hing one for anothers Fault, where there is previous Con&s;ent, as in the Ca&s;e of Ho&s;tages; tho' it is e&s;&s;ential to pu|ni&s;hment to be inflicted for Sin, yet not on the Per&s;on &s;inning, for in the Judgment of the Law, the Sinner and Surety are one.</P>
<P>EXCHANGE in Criminal Ca&s;es it is true is not allowed, but that is not from a Suppo&s;ition of Inju&s;tice in its Nature, for then it would not be allowed in civil; but for other Rea&s;ons, &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e Life is a Depo&s;itum committed to us, to be pre|&s;erved till God or the publick Good calls for it; be&s;ides the Pub|lick would &s;uffer lo&s;s by the De&s;truction of one of its Members, and perhaps the &s;urviving nocent, or guilty Per&s;on, grow wor&s;e by impunity.</P>
<P>Moreover we &s;hould remember, that there is a difference be|tween the &s;ame Per&s;on, when ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, and by him|&s;elf, and when &s;u&s;taining the Repre&s;entation of others, &s;ince &s;uch a one's Inocence, tho' it renders him incapable of &s;uffering, &s;trictly &s;o called, in the former of the&s;e re&s;pects, yet not in the latter, becau&s;e the Law then no longer looks upon his private but publick Character; and con&s;equently the Puni&s;hment of tho&s;e he repre&s;ents devolves upon their Proxy. The&s;e Things duly con|&s;idered, the afore&s;aid grand and popular Objection vani&s;hes into Smoke.</P>
<P>But it is again objected, that the Puni&s;hment which our SAVI|OUR, underwent, was not the &s;ame which the Law threatned, and therefore is not Satisfactory; it is but the Death of one, but a tran&s;ient and temporal Death, whereas the eternal Death of all was threatned.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is true there was a Difference in &s;ome Circum|&s;tances, but not in Sub&s;tance. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did endure a real tem|poral Death, and &s;omething Equivalent to an eternal, in weight and value. He could not endure indeed the reproaches of a &s;inful Mind, or the Angui&s;h of De&s;pair, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature of Things, that the&s;e Calamities could come upon an ino|cent and divine Per&s;on, they being the re&s;ult of per&s;onal Guilt and Impotency to atone for it; but our Lord endured Agonies of a|nother Kind, the awful apprehen&s;ions of a painful ignominious Death, the Malice of <HI>Satan,</HI> and the unrelenting Vengeance of Almighty God, which all united at once again&s;t him; while in the mean Time the divine Nature, as it were, withdrew from his relief. Whatever were the Ingredients of that <HI>bitter Cup</HI> which God that mix'd them, and he that drunk them, only knew, yet this we may &s;ay, that it could be no ordinary <HI>penal</HI> pre&s;&s;ure,
<PB N="23" REF="040518_0062_1015E96A5E65D088">
which could overwhelm his Soul with &s;uch a deluge of Grief, di&s;&s;olve his Body into a &s;weat of Blood, and at la&s;t extort that awful outcry, <HI>My God, My God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me.</HI> This inexpre&s;&s;ible weight of Pain, which the dignity of his Per&s;on put an immen&s;e Value upon, made his Sufferings equal to the Guilt of all he repre&s;ented, and more than equal to the &s;ufferings of all Mankind; the eternal angui&s;h of the whole human Race could not have to much honoured the Ju&s;tice and Law of God, as the Sufferings of God him&s;elf in our Nature, tho' but for a &s;mall &s;pace of Time</P>
<P>But to open and illu&s;trate this Matter more fully, let it be con|&s;ider'd, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Redeemer</HI> to pay the Debt of Penalty denounced by the Law for Sin, in all the Circum&s;tances of it: He did indeed endure a <HI>natural Death</HI> &s;trictly &s;o called, but then it was but one in the Room of Millions, the Defficiency of which was made up by the Dignity of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT as to <HI>&s;piritual Death,</HI> tho' he bore &s;omething like it, <HI>viz</HI> the withdrawing for a Time a comfortable Sen&s;e of his Fa|thers love, and angui&s;h of Spirit, in a Degree that we cannot con|ceive or expre&s;s; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould endure it in all its Parts &s;trictly and properly; for as <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Life includes the&s;e two Things, <HI>viz,</HI> a Union to God by Faith and pious Ha|bits, from which all truly &s;piritual and acceptable Acts proceed, &s;o by the Law of Contraries, <HI>&s;piritual Death</HI> mu&s;t needs include a real Separation from God, a real removal or privation of pious Habits, for &s;o long as one has them, however clouded, weakned or out of Exerci&s;e, tho' he may be &s;aid to be in a &s;piritual Sleep or Con&s;umption, yet he is &s;till alive.</P>
<P>NOW to &s;uppo&s;e that the human <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;eparated from the divine Nature, as it is without Foundation in Scripture, &s;o it de&s;troys the infinite value of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of it to Ju&s;tice, which depends upon that Union.</P>
<P>AND to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was devoid of pious Principles or Habits, is to make him a SINNER realy and inherently, and thus to di&s;qualify him entirely from being a <HI>Saviour</HI> of others. The Rea&s;on is this, the moral Law being &s;piritual, in Regard of its <HI>Author, Nature</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> and Perfect al&s;o, mu&s;t needs re|quire Purity in the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Soul, which cannot be without the afore&s;aid Habits: Now if CHRIST wanted the&s;e, he was di&s;conformed to the Law, and &s;o a <HI>Sinner</HI> realy and inherently, for Sin is any want of Conformity to, or Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 4. He amartia e&s;tin, he anomia.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF &s;o, CHRIST would want another MEDIATOR to &s;ave him, and therefore he was only made Sin by Imputation, being in the mean Time per&s;onally and inherently holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled, and knowing no Sin.</P>
<P>WHAT was defective in the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s human Nature,
<PB N="24" REF="040518_0063_1015E96BDFDECC58">
in re&s;pect of the Species or Circum&s;tances of the Penalty threatned by the Law, was made up by its Union with the divine, and &s;o rendered an equivalent to the demerit of Sin.</P>
<P>AND indeed in this Con&s;titution, the Wi&s;dom of God appears admirably; for on the Suppo&s;ition that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> paid the Debt in Specie in all Circum&s;tances which the Law required, (were that po&s;&s;ible) the Bond would be cancelled, and all tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> repre|&s;ented actually freed from the Cur&s;e, at lea&s;t from the Time of the Payment made by the Surety, which Notion is as dangerous as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>BUT an EQUIVALENT puts it into the original <HI>Creditors</HI> Power whether he will accept of it at all, and when, and how to com|municate the Benefits thereof to the Debtors.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE hereto the ble&s;&s;ed God has, in un&s;peakable Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s, &s;o formed the Plan of the new Covenant, that none &s;hall have any actual Title to, or Inve&s;titure in the Be|nefits of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Purcha&s;e, until they be enabled to repent and believe.</P>
<P>THIS, rightly under&s;tood, entirely over&s;ets the dangerous and incon&s;i&s;tent Doctrines of the <HI>Antinomians,</HI> pre&s;erves the Harmony of the Scriptures, and makes the Doctrines of Grace and Duties of Religion entirely con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Objection is this, How could God receive this Sa|tisfaction, &s;ince he him&s;elf was the Party that gave it? Or how could the <HI>Saviour</HI> of Mankind, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be God, make Satisfaction to him&s;elf? The An&s;wer is,</P>
<P><Q>THAT the infinite Goodne&s;s of God in giving a Redeemer, does not dive&s;t him of the Office of &s;upreme Judge, nor hinder him from receiving a <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> to pre&s;erve the Rights of Ju&s;tice inviola|ble. To illu&s;trate this Matter, we have an eminent In&s;tance, not unlike it, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Locrians,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed a Law, that <HI>Adulterers</HI> &s;hould loo&s;e both their Eyes; and when his Son was convicted of that Crime, the People, who re|&s;pected him for his excellent Qualities, came and interceeded for him, <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> in a conflict between Zeal for Ju&s;tice and Affection to his Son, took but one Eye from him, and parted with one of his own to &s;atisfy the Law, and in this Action both paid and received the Puni&s;hment: He paid it as a Father, and received it as a Con&s;er|vator of publick Ju&s;tice. In like Manner when guilty Mankind could not pay the Forfeiture of the Law, God, the Father of Mercies, was plea&s;ed to give it from the Trea&s;ures of his Love, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Blood</HI> of his Son for our Ran&s;om; which he neverthe|le&s;s as the Supreme Judge received from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> upon the Cro&s;s, and declared it <HI>to be an Offering of a &s;weet &s;melling Savour to him,</HI> or a &s;ufficient Satisfaction to his Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOR is it incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, that the Son of God, clothed with our Nature, &s;hould by Death make Satisfaction to the <HI>Deity,</HI> and therefore to him&s;elf. In a Difference between two Parties, a Per&s;on that belongs to one of them, may interpo&s;e for Recon|ciliation
<PB N="25" REF="040518_0064_1015E96D63FCD460">
provided he dive&s;ts his own Intere&s;t, and leaves it with the Party from whom he comes. For In&s;tance, when a Father and Son, both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Imperial Power, have been offended by rebellious Subjects, it may not be improper for the Son to inter|po&s;e as a <HI>Mediator,</HI> to re&s;tore them to the favour of their <HI>Prince,</HI> and yet at the &s;ame Time he reconciles them to him&s;elf, and pro|cures them the Pardon of an Offence whereby his own Maje&s;ty was violated.</Q> But the Time requires that I ha&s;ten to the Im|provement.</P>
<P>HAS <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> been &s;lain as a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Propitiation</HI> for us? Then how vain, how uncomfortable and perilous is the Opi|nion of tho&s;e who deny the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to Be|lievers; for hereby they endeavour to &s;ap the Foundations of the Chri&s;tian's Hope, and &s;hut up the Springs of their Joy, hereby they oppo&s;e the continued Series of Revelation both in the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Te&s;tament:</HI> To <HI>deny</HI> the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Believers,</HI> is the <HI>&s;ame Thing</HI> in <HI>effect,</HI> as to deny his being <HI>&s;acrificed</HI> for them, and equally <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> as has been before repre|&s;ented, and if CHRIST has not died our Faith is vain, we are without Hope, Help, Comfort; but ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, tho' the Doctrine of CHRIST crucified be to the <HI>Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the</HI> Greeks <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s, yet to tho&s;e that believe, it is the Wi&s;dom of GOD, and the Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>HAS <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> been &s;et forth as a Sacrifice of <HI>Propitiation,</HI> then we may hence learn the Sinfulne&s;s of Sin and &s;trictne&s;s of divine Ju&s;tice in the Puni&s;hment of it; its true, the Evil of <HI>Sin</HI> may be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure di&s;cerned from its malignant Nature, being an Enmity again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, a Contrariety to, and di&s;honour|able Reflexion upon all his adorable Attributes, as well as a re|bellious Contempt of all the &s;acred and unalianable Rights of his Government over the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> World.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t affecting Demon&s;tration of its Malignity appears in tho&s;e Puni&s;hments which are inflicted for it; the Torments of the <HI>Damned</HI> are, no doubt, equal to the Demerit, and therefore expre&s;&s;ive of the great <HI>Evil</HI> of it: But they are too little thought upon and realiz'd by &s;tupid, indolent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, until it be too late to obtain a Deliverance; and temporal Calamities cannot &s;ufficiently repre&s;ent the infinite <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of GOD again&s;t the ob&s;tinate and ungrateful Contempt of his Goodne&s;s and Govern|ment; but in the Sacrifice and Sufferings of CHRIST it is expre&s;&s;ed to the utmo&s;t in the mo&s;t &s;trong and flaming Colours. Had divine Ju&s;|tice rent the Heavens and appear'd on this Theatre, attended with the mo&s;t terrible Images of Pomp and Maje&s;ty, to puni&s;h the Af|fronts and In&s;ults ca&s;t upon the Authority of GOD by impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, it could not make a deeper and more abiding Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon our Minds, than the due Con&s;ideration of the Suf|ferings of our Lord JESUS: The drowning of the <HI>Old World</HI> by an awful Inundation of Water, and the dreadful De&s;truction of the Cities of the <HI>Plain</HI> by <HI>Showers of Fire,</HI> do not &s;et the

Evil of <HI>Sin,</HI> and divine Severity in the Puni&s;hment of it in &s;o &s;trong and &s;triking a Light; if we con&s;ider not only the Depth of his Sufferings but the Dignity of his Per&s;on, and near Rela|tion to his eternal Father; he &s;uffered not only <HI>Torments</HI> from Men many Ways, but his <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>Wrath</HI> in a Degree equal to the De&s;ert of all the <HI>Sins</HI> of tho&s;e he repre&s;ented; and the Per&s;on who endured the&s;e Things was the <HI>Son of GOD by Nature,</HI> and of co-equal Glory and Maje&s;ty with his eternal Father. O how in|flexible is the Ju&s;tice of GOD, that would not &s;pare even his own innocent and beloved Son, when he became <HI>Surety</HI> for Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>_THE Apo&s;tle in the&s;e Ver&s;es, labours to a&s;&s;wage and moderate the Sorrows of Chri&s;tians, on Occa&s;ion of the Depar|ture of their pious Friends, Acquain|tances and Relations, by ob&s;erving to them, that their <HI>Death</HI> was but like a <HI>Sleep,</HI> from which they &s;hould be in due Sea&s;on awak'd; and that to indulge an exce&s;s of Grief on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, was but to imitate the unrea&s;onable prac|tice of the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who had no Hope of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality en&s;uing upon it. This Re&s;urrection the A|po&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equent of the Re&s;urrection of CHRIST, <HI>for if we believe that</HI> JESUS <HI>dyed and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in</HI> JESUS, <HI>will God bring with him,</HI> i. e.

<P>FROM the Words of our Text con&s;ider'd complexly, we may collect the following <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> which I think contains their Sub&s;tance and Scope, viz. <HI>That the Con&s;ideration of the glorious Re|&s;urrection of &s;uch as &s;leep in</HI> JESUS, <HI>may ju&s;tly check immoderate Sorrow for their Departure from us.</HI></P>

I return to the</P>
<P N="1">I. Propos'd, Which was to enquire, <HI>who tho&s;e are that</HI> Sleep <HI>in</HI> JESUS. Previous to which I would ob&s;erve, that <HI>Death</HI> is here compared to a <HI>Sleep,</HI> becau&s;e of the Analogy between them, e&s;pecially in the following In&s;tances, namely.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="040518_0069_1015E97A98BDD4F0">WHEN we <HI>Sleep</HI> our <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> are <HI>bound up,</HI> &s;o that we cannot be|hold what is done about us. And thus when we die, our Eyes are &s;hut, our Eye &s;trings broken, &s;o that we cannot behold what is done under the Sun.</P>
<P>WHEN we <HI>&s;leep</HI> we are likewi&s;e <HI>unactive</HI> and cannot carry on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life. And thus in the <HI>Grave</HI> whither we all ha&s;ten, there is no Work nor Invention, and therefore we &s;hould Work while the Day la&s;ts.</P>
<P>FARTHER, <HI>Sleep</HI> gives <HI>re&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Body.</HI> And does not Death do &s;o likewi&s;e? <HI>Job,</HI> &s;peaking of Death, &s;ayeth, <HI>I &s;hould have lien &s;till and been quiet, I &s;hould have &s;lept, then had I been at re&s;t.</HI> In the Grave is a <HI>Re&s;t</HI> from labour and travail, a <HI>Re&s;t</HI> from trouble and oppre&s;&s;ion, <HI>there the Wicked cea&s;e from Troubling, and the Weary are at Re&s;t,</HI> a <HI>re&s;t</HI> from Sorrow and Suffering, no Sickne&s;s or Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hall afflict us there, and that which is indeed the be&s;t of all, there is a <HI>re&s;t</HI> from Sin and every Temp|tation to it!</P>

<P>WE go to <HI>Sleep</HI> without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing <HI>dread,</HI> nay &s;ometimes we earne&s;tly <HI>de&s;ire</HI> it.

<P>WHILE in a State of Nature we are &s;eparated from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and mu&s;t, in order to our vital union to him by Faith, be con|vinced by the Word and Spirit of God, of our guilty, dangerous and helple&s;s Ca&s;e, &s;o as to be &s;eriou&s;ly affected with a view of it, and con&s;trained to fly to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as our only Re|medy, and embrace him as our <HI>Prophet, Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>King</HI> without re&s;erve: When this is Real and Sincere, we are united to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in a &s;aving Way; and, as a natural con&s;equent of this Union, Com|munications of divine Light, Love and Life are vouch&s;afed upon us, which transform us into the Image of God more and more in our inward governing Di&s;po&s;itions; and encline us habitually to endeavour Conformity thereto in Practice.

<P>HERE it may not be improper to offer &s;ome general Hints concerning <HI>Death,</HI> which is doubtle&s;s a Di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Union</HI> between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oul and Body, whereby tho' the Soul is not hin|dred in its activity, yet the Body is hereby rendred a pale and in|active <HI>Carca&s;s!</HI> If the Soul &s;ometimes acts without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Body, while it is in a State of Union with it, as particular|ly in <HI>&s;leep;</HI> how much more may it act in a State of Separation from it.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred Scriptures inform us, that <HI>Death</HI> came into the World by <HI>Sin,</HI> and is the <HI>Wages</HI> of it, and to this Te&s;timony right Rea&s;on accords, for why &s;hould a Puni&s;hment be inflicted without re&s;pect had to a previous Fault?</P>
<P>THAT which gives <HI>Death</HI> a very &s;olemn Sound, is that it not only concludes the Projects, Labours, and Enjoyments of <HI>Life,</HI> but likewi&s;e brings the Sea&s;ons and Means of <HI>Grace</HI> we enjoy to a final Period; we are then call'd to an account for our Steward&s;hip, <HI>for we may be no longer Stewards. When Men's Breath goeth out, in that very Day their Thoughts peri&s;h:</HI> All the Projects to &s;ecure a future temporal Good, which perhaps too much occupy'd and perplex'd their anxious labouring Minds, are &s;uddenly broken and cru&s;hed by the Foot of <HI>Death,</HI> and they of Con&s;equence di&s;appointed of their fond Expectations!</P>
<P>AT <HI>Death</HI> our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tate of <HI>Trial</HI> expires, and we immediately enter into an unchangeable and eternal State of Rewards or Puni&s;h|ments; the Comfort or Mi&s;ery of which, the &s;tronge&s;t Imagination cannot &s;ufficiently paint, the large&s;t Under&s;tanding comprehend or the mo&s;t eloquent Tongue expre&s;s.</P>
<P>AND tho' the <HI>Time</HI> of our <HI>Death</HI> be known to and fixed by the Almighty, who has appointed to Man, as a <HI>Hireling,</HI> his <HI>Days,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed his <HI>Bounds</HI> &s;o that he cannot pa&s;s, yet from us it is for wi&s;e Rea&s;ons kept &s;ecret, that we may be thereby excited to continual Preparation, &s;eeing we know not what a Day may bring forth.

<P>IF tho&s;e that are alive at the coming of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to Judgment &s;hall not die, but be changed in a moment, as was before ob&s;erved, then the &s;ame Body, in Sub&s;tance, that is now united to the Soul, is only altered or changed as to its Qualities, and goes to Heaven: If it is not &s;eparated from the Soul, it goes with it to Heaven; but it is not &s;eparated, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle (1 Cor. xv. 7.) <HI>Behold I &s;hew you a My&s;tery, we &s;hall not all Sleep, but we &s;hall all be changed in a Moment at the la&s;t Trump.</HI> Now without <HI>Death</HI> (which is fre|quently term'd <HI>Sleep</HI> in Scripture) there can be no Separation of the Soul from the Body, for the Nature of Death con&s;i&s;ts therein: And if the pre&s;ent Body be not &s;eparated, another newly created cannot be united to the Soul, unle&s;s it be &s;uppos'd to go to Hea|ven with two Bodies of different Kinds, which is as ab&s;urd as it is un&s;criptural.</P>

Sub&s;tance with them, pure Spirits; for that is not a&s;&s;erted, and indeed to a&s;&s;ert it, implies a Contradiction, for a <HI>Body</HI> and a <HI>Spi|rit</HI> are of different Natures, &s;o that both can not be the &s;ame; this our Lord confirms by the&s;e Words before mentioned, <HI>a Spirit hath not Fle&s;h and Bones, as ye &s;ee me have: Behold my Hands and Feet, that it is I my&s;elf handle me and &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> informs us, that he and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles obey'd this Precept, of their Ma&s;ter, <HI>that which was from the Beginning,</HI> (in re&s;pect of his divine Nature) <HI>which we have heard, which we have &s;een with our Eyes, which we have looked on,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>and our Hands have handled of the Word of Life, and bear witne&s;s that eternal Life was with the Father, and was manife&s;ted unto us.</HI> (1. John i. 1, 2.) The Apo&s;tles handled or felt the Body of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> both before his Death, and after his Re&s;urrection. (See <HI>Matt.</HI> xiv. 31. <HI>John</HI> xiii. 23. <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 39&mdash;44. <HI>John</HI> xx. 27, 28, 29.)</P>
<P>TO the afore&s;aid <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> of the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>faithful Witne&s;s;</HI> right <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> adds its <HI>&s;uffrage,</HI> by informing us, that a <HI>Body</HI> is a <HI>material Sub&s;tance,</HI> which may be <HI>&s;een</HI> and <HI>felt,</HI> and has the <HI>Di|men&s;ions</HI> of <HI>length, breadth, height,</HI> and <HI>depth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that a <HI>Spirit</HI> is an <HI>intelligent Being,</HI> without <HI>Matter,</HI> and con&s;equently without the Properties of it; a <HI>Being</HI> that can neither be <HI>&s;een</HI> or <HI>felt;</HI> a <HI>Being</HI> that has no <HI>Colour</HI> or <HI>Figure,</HI> no <HI>Breadth, Length,</HI> &amp;c. He that contradicts this, does not only contradict the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> but &s;et him&s;elf in Oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Science,</HI> as well as to <HI>Experience,</HI> and <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that <HI>it is &s;own a natural Body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual Body;</HI> yes, but &s;till he calls it a <HI>Body,</HI> and points to the &s;ame Body that was <HI>&s;own</HI> or put into the <HI>Grave;</HI> and therefore mu&s;t intend <HI>Matter</HI> however refind, or el&s;e he does not &s;peak good Sen&s;e; but the latter is impious to imagine, and there|fore the former is true. If the Apo&s;tle had de&s;ign'd to acquaint us, that a new <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Soul,</HI> &s;hould be added at the general Judge|ment, to the one we have already; he would have told us &s;o, by a&s;&s;igning to it, it's proper Name of <HI>Spirit,</HI> and not <HI>&s;piritual Body,</HI> or Body &s;piritualiz'd.</P>
<P>IN a Word, that <HI>&s;piritual Body,</HI> the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, either has <HI>Matter,</HI> or it has not. If it has not, then either a <HI>new Soul</HI> will be then created, and added to this; and &s;o every one will have <HI>two Souls,</HI> which is as ridiculous as it is un&s;criptural! Or el&s;e the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the pre&s;ent <HI>Body</HI> will be turn'd into a pure <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is more ab&s;urd, if po&s;&s;ible, than the former! Be|cau&s;e in this Ca&s;e it not only follows, that every one will have two <HI>Souls,</HI> but that in order to the Formation of one of them, the Sub&s;tance of the pre&s;ent Body mu&s;t be reduced to nothing, for while it retains the Nature of a <HI>Body,</HI> it cannot be a <HI>Spirit;</HI> and if it be reduced to Nothing, how can it be &s;aid to be turn'd into a Spirit? Is it not as contrary to the divine <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> to anhi|liate any Part of his Creation, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for his <HI>Power,</HI>

If the very Body of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (as to Sub&s;tance) which was laid in the Sepulchre did not go to Heaven, the APOSTLES are FALSE WITNESSES CHRIST him&s;elf is unworthy of our CREDIT! and con&s;equently his RELIGION OVERTHROWN!</P>

<P>THE Doctrinal Propo&s;ition I have been di&s;cour&s;ing upon, ea&s;ily applies it&s;elf to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, fora&s;much as there is Rea&s;on to hope, from the decea&s;ed Youths &s;oundne&s;s in Chri&s;|tian Principles, acquaintance with experimental Religion, and blamele&s;s Conver&s;ation, that he &s;lept in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> there is no Rea&s;on for his Relations indulging an exce&s;s of Grief, on Occa&s;ion of his Departure from them to a better World.

<P>BUT to addre&s;s the Audience more generally. Seeing that tho&s;e who Sleep in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> are tran&s;lated to &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed State, we &s;hould enquire, whether we are in <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> For &s;urely none but &s;uch who are in him in Life, can rea&s;onably expect to Sleep in him at Death. Have we received <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by <HI>Faith?</HI> Have we had Communion in his Love? And are we conformed to his Law? Is <HI>Chri&s;t precious</HI> to us?

But &s;uch as are de&s;titute of the afore&s;aid Characters, have great Rea&s;on to be afraid of Death, becau&s;e of the dreadful Con&s;equences of it to Chri&s;tle&s;s Souls. Is it not a dreadful Thing to be forever &s;eparated from all the Sweets of Paradi&s;e, and to fall into the Hands of the living God?</P>
<P>DOES <HI>Death</HI> put a final period to all our temporal Enjoy|ments? Then &s;hould we not labour to be weaned from them, and &s;et our Affections on the Things that are above?</P>
<P>O BRETHREN! What Rea&s;on have &s;uch dying Worms as we, who mu&s;t be &s;o &s;oon reduced to Rottene&s;s and Putrefaction, and

who are liable to the &s;troke of Death every Moment, to be hum|ble, watchful, and diligent in &s;eeking and &s;erving God?</P>
<P>THIS In&s;tance of Mortality, calls aloud upon us all, to &s;eek a vital Union to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;peedily and vehemently, that &s;o when God-Man &s;ends his Me&s;&s;enger for us, we may &s;weetly &s;leep in him, and be at la&s;t brought in triumph with him to the general Judgement; To this End we &s;hould confe&s;s and bewail our Offences, turn from them, and embrace the <HI>Mediator.</HI></P>
<P>But in particular, methinks, this <HI>Providence</HI> &s;hould alarm <HI>young People,</HI> to <HI>remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, while the evil Days are far off, when they &s;hall &s;ay they have no Plea&s;ure in them.</HI></P>
<P>O how amiable is <HI>Religion</HI> in <HI>Youth!</HI> It is like Blo&s;&s;oms in the Spring, &s;urely it is more likely that you &s;hall find GOD in a way of Mercy in <HI>Youth,</HI> than afterwards, in ca&s;e you &s;eek him heartily; for your Hearts are now more tender and receptive of good Impre&s;&s;ions, and GOD generally &s;trives more with &s;uch, than others, <HI>I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me,</HI> &s;aith the Almighty: But if ye give a deaf Ear to GOD'S gracious Calls by his Word and Providence, have ye not Rea&s;on to fear that his Spirit will cea&s;e &s;triving with you, and that your Hearts will be judicially hardened!</P>
<P>SURELY the earlier ye turn to God, ye will have the clearer Evidence of your Sincerity, and the greater Opportunity of Ser|viceablene&s;s to Mankind in general, and to your Relations in particular, upon whom the Example of your early Religion may have a ble&s;&s;ed Effect, which may GOD grant, for CHRIST'S Sake.

<P>Knowing therefore the Terror of the LORD we per&s;wade Men.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_MY Fathers and Brethren, the governing Pa&s;&s;ions of the human Soul, which are indeed the great Sources of Action, are <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fear.</HI> Now the Religion of JESUS contains Arguments no|bly adapted to influence both, which is indeed its peculiar Glory. Here are the mo&s;t power|ful attractives to allure our <HI>love</HI> and &s;trike our <HI>ingenuity</HI> that ever were pre&s;ented to the human Mind. I mean redeeming Love and Goodne&s;s, the a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cention of God him&s;elf in a&s;&s;uming our Nature, under the ruinous Circum&s;tances con&s;equent to our Apo&s;tacy, and therein enduring voluntarily and patiently, in his Name, Body and Soul, all that Contempt and Mi&s;ery which our Sins demerited, in order to reconcile us to GOD, and &s;ave us from Wrath and Ruin. O matchle&s;s Mercy! O amazing Goodne&s;s! O the intollerable, incomprehen&s;ible and inxpre&s;&s;ible Agonies and Pains our dear dear, Lord endured! One would think that the mentioning of this <HI>Love</HI> alone, was &s;ufficient to con&s;train Mankind to follow the <HI>Redeemer</HI>'s Standard, and to <HI>dare</HI> to be Holy. But &s;ad Experience proves the Contrary. Degenerate Mankind, while under the Dominion of Sin, are almo&s;t wholly lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of Ingenuity and Gratitude. Nothing truly Great and Noble has the habitual a&s;cendant in them. No! Immoderate Self-love is the &s;ecret Spring of all their Motions, and therefore it's nece&s;|&s;ary to alarm tho&s;e <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Souls out of their fatal Security and In|dolence, by Arguments of <HI>Terror,</HI> that hereby they may be brought to a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of their Danger, and con&s;equently con&s;trained to the earne&s;t U&s;e of Means to obtain an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>THIS the primitive Mini&s;ters of CHRIST were well aware of, as the Text I have cho&s;en to di&s;cour&s;e upon informs us. They having had the Experience of the <HI>Terrors</HI> of God upon their own Minds, before their clo&s;ure with JESUS, and having known their Nece&s;&s;ity, Influence and U&s;e, did labour by the &s;ame Arguments to per|&s;wade others to be Holy, <HI>Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we per&s;wade Men.</HI></P>
<P>AND methinks among all the Arguments of <HI>Terror</HI> gra&s;p'd in the &s;acred Volumn, none is more affecting and awful than that of the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> and this is what our Text refers to, and is therefore the Subject of our pre&s;ent Meditations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>General Judgment,</HI> my Brethren, is one of the mo&s;t grand

and important Events that comes within the Compa&s;s of human Knowledge; the Con&s;ideration whereof &s;hould &s;ummons all our Powers to the mo&s;t reverend and deep Attention.</P>
<P>THAT there is a JUDGMENT to come, appears from the na|tural Subordination of Man to God, as a Creature to his Creator, a Subject to his Prince, and a Servant to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>FROM this <HI>Subordination,</HI> corre&s;pondent Obligations do re&s;ult: for the Neglect or Performance of which, it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould Account, and receive <HI>Rewards</HI> accordingly, otherwi&s;e the afore&s;aid Relations and Obligations would be vain and to no Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are likewi&s;e natural Relations among Men, and Tran&s;|actions which give ground to &s;everal Duties of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Huma|nity,</HI> by the neglect of which others may &s;uffer great Injury, of which they can &s;ometimes get no redre&s;s.

This was the Apo&s;tle's Judgment in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> he a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that it is a righteous Thing with God, to recompence Tribulation to tho&s;e that trouble his People, and to them who are troubled re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AND are there not many &s;ecret good and bad Di&s;po&s;itions, which are not nor cannot be here awarded? Then is it not rea&s;onable that there &s;hould be a Time when both &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed and obtain an an&s;werable recompence?</P>
<P>THERE have been, and no doubt are in the World, &s;uch Per&s;ons who commit great Injuries, and yet no Ju&s;tice can be got of them, either becau&s;e of their Policy, their Power, or Authority: Is it not nece&s;&s;ary therefore that there &s;hould be a &s;upreme Tri|bunal, before which &s;uch grand, in&s;olent and ungovernable Cri|minals &s;hould be arraigned? Not to &s;ay that Con&s;cience accu&s;es for the mo&s;t &s;ecret Crimes, and pre&s;ages a Judgment to come; yea the common Sen&s;e of Mankind dictates the rea&s;onablene&s;s of Pu|ni&s;hment to the Guilty. Does not every Per&s;on when he &s;ees ano|ther guilty of gro&s;s Crimes, judge it unfit that he &s;hould e&s;cape with Impunity? And will not the Mind be grated with In|dignation or Grief by beholding the Inocent and Beneficent Suf|fering?</P>

<P>IF you enquire concerning the <HI>Judge,</HI> I an&s;wer, the ab&s;olute Power of judging, in&s;eparably belongs to God the Father, he being our Creator, to his Judgment we &s;tand obnoxious But the <HI>exer|ci&s;e</HI> of this <HI>judicial</HI> Authority, is, for wi&s;e Purpo&s;es, committed to the Son.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that the Judge &s;hould be vi&s;ible, in order to the clearer Conviction and more ample Satisfaction of the Parties con|cerned.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Judgment</HI> is a Branch of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingly Office,</HI> which the Father conferred upon him as a Reward of his mediatorial aba&s;ure. Indeed it is an Office of two great emi|nence to be conferred upon any other, to determine the final States of intelligent Beings; the <HI>Lamb is only worthy to take the Book of Judgment and open the Seals thereof, becau&s;e he hath redeemed us to God by his Blood.</HI> It is he alone who hath a Capacity for this Province, becau&s;e of his Omni&s;cience, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND &s;urely, <HI>Sirs,</HI> it is but right that the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be ve&s;ted with a Power to reward his Friends, and cru&s;h his inveterate Enemies that &s;o the apparent di&s;honours of his Cro&s;s may be forever rol'd away.</P>
<P>FARTHER, the Glories of God's Wi&s;dom and Love, are di&s;|play'd in appointing &s;o well qualified a Per&s;on, &s;o meek, &s;o loving, &s;o merciful a Judge. Not to &s;ay, that this appointment likewi&s;e &s;erves to beget in us, a Reverence of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> an Ob&s;ervance of his Laws, and an Imitation of his Example.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Manner</HI> of the judicial Proce&s;s, the &s;acred Scriptures give us the following account hereof, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Time is ap|pointed for it, which is called <HI>a Day.</HI></P>
<P>THAT God hath regi&s;tered Men's Actions in the Book of his Omni&s;cience in order to it.</P>
<P>THAT for this End, a Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t &s;hall be effected by Almighty Power.</P>
<P>THAT then all Per&s;ons rai&s;ed, &s;hall be pre&s;ented before the Bar of God; <HI>I &s;aw,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>John, the Dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God,</HI></P>
<P>THAT every Thought, Word and Action &s;hall be examined, <HI>God will bring to light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and make manife&s;t the Coun&s;els of all Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>THAT after this, a definitive Sentence &s;hall pa&s;s agreeable to Mens Actions, which &s;hall be accordingly executed.</P>

What tho' we endure unju&s;t in|vectives for a Time, God <HI>will bring forth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his People as the Light, and their Judgment as the noon Day;</HI> and hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>it was a &s;mall Thing to him, to be judged of Man's Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, <HI>Sirs,</HI> we &s;hould be excited to examine our Sates, our Principles of Action, our Speeches and Works, and &s;ee whether they will &s;tand the tryal of the <HI>la&s;t Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>METHINKS, dear Brethren, the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>la&s;t Judg|ment,</HI> may ju&s;tly &s;trike <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ternation</HI> into every Tribe of Impenitents; if it be con&s;idered, that it &s;hall be univer&s;al as to Per&s;ons and Things, as well as impartial and irrever&s;ible.

<P>THE mo&s;t &s;ecret impious Thought mu&s;t then be di&s;clo&s;ed, and the mo&s;t di&s;gui&s;ed Contrivances brought to the open light of <HI>Day;</HI> and it is but rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;eeing the moral Good and Evil of Actions much depend upon their Intention. The Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who is a <HI>di&s;cerner of the Thoughts, and &s;earcher of the Heart,</HI> will, in the Day of his coming, examine and open the &s;ecret Springs of the Actions of Men; and then likewi&s;e &s;hall their Words be &s;can'd and judg'd; and this is but rea&s;onable, &s;eeing they are the mo&s;t natural Indications of the Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Mind, and often do much Injury to the Names, Bodies and E&s;tates of Men. Our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that Men mu&s;t give an Account of every idle Word in that Day, (Mat.</HI> xii. 36, 37.) <HI>and that by our Words we &s;hall be ju&s;tifyed, and by our Words we &s;hall be condemned.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> informs us, that <HI>Enoch,</HI> the &s;eventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> prophe&s;ied of the&s;e Things &s;aying, <HI>that the LORD &s;hall come with with ten Thou&s;and of his Saints to ex|ecute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly Deeds and hard Speeches.</HI> How &s;hall the <HI>lyar,</HI> the <HI>unju&s;t Per&s;on,</HI> the <HI>whoremonger,</HI> the <HI>&s;landerer</HI> and <HI>back-biter</HI> then appear?</P>

<P>WITH what awful Solemnity does the holy Scriptures repre&s;ent the Scene of the la&s;t Judgement, then, we are told, that <HI>there will be di&s;tre&s;s of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea roaring and Men</HI>'s <HI>Hearts failing them for fear, that then the Sun &s;hall be darkned and the Moon &s;hall not give her Light, and all the Powers of Heaven be &s;haken;</HI> that the <HI>Archangel</HI>'s <HI>Trumpet &s;hall &s;ound to the Extremities of the Earth, after which the Son of Man &s;hall de&s;cend from the vi&s;ible Heavens in a Cloud, and appear in his own and in his Father</HI>'s <HI>Glory.
