<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>SOME time ago Ari&s;tides addre&s;&s;ed you on a motion which had been made in the hou&s;e of delegates for a removal of the &s;eat of government; he was in&s;tantly attacked by a pair of writers, who&s;e chief aim &s;eems to have been to depreciate his character. There is, however, a third, who expre&s;&s;es a regard for decency, who premi&s;es that he will be|have like a gentleman, and examine the rea&s;ons of Ari&s;tides with candour and moderation; it is to him only that Ari&s;ti|des thinks proper to reply.</P>
<P>In the Farmer's &s;econd paragraph, he &s;eems to have for|gotten the promi&s;e he had ju&s;t before made; he taxes Ari&s;ti|des with &s;ini&s;ter ambitious views, and with feeling a malig|nant plea&s;ure in the pro&s;pect of preventing a great public good. Let us then examine this matter, as he &s;ays, with the "critical eyes of unerring truth."</P>
<P>From whom flowed the propo&s;ition to the general a&s;&s;em|bly? Who are the men that clamour for the mea&s;ure? The community at large, feeling no inconvenience, were content that things &s;hould remain as they are, and, without the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of the Farmer and his coadjutors, would not have probably thought of a change. The citizens of Annapolis were oppo&s;ed to their own de&s;truction; no &s;hadow of argu|ment had been offered to demon&s;trate, that by quietly giving up their intere&s;ts, they would have a merit in &s;acrificing to the public good. Notwith&s;tanding all this, the Farmer, for their conduct on this occa&s;ion, reproaches them for yielding to the "never failing influence of private intere&s;t." No practice is more common with mankind, than that of con|demning in their neighbours the faults mo&s;t con&s;picuous in them&s;elves; it ari&s;es from the vain expectation of deceiving the world. But the Farmer's intelligent readers mu&s;t have anticipated me in the remark.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="019698_0003_0FADA349CD054080">
Has the Farmer then, by his fir&s;t publication, given a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the rea&s;ons of Ari&s;tides re&s;pecting the power of the legi&s;lature? He has cho&s;en for his publication that paper which has the mo&s;t general circulation, the editor of which had refu&s;ed a place to Ari&s;tides; he &s;ometimes quotes part of a &s;entence from Ari&s;tides, but it is impo&s;&s;ible for his readers, from his &s;tate, to comprehend what was the rea&s;oning of Ari&s;tides. It is on the&s;e con&s;iderations that Ari&s;tides adopts this mode of publication, in which he will recapitulate &s;ome of his former ob&s;ervations, and add &s;uch remarks as have &s;ince occurred on a more mature delibe|ration.</P>
<P>The 9th article of the declaration of rights directs, <Q>that a place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature ought to be fixed, the mo&s;t convenient to the members thereof, and to the depo&s;itory of the public records; and the legi&s;lature ought not to be convened, or held, at ony other place, but from evident nece&s;&s;ity.</Q> The 61&s;t and la&s;t clau&s;e of the con|&s;titution and form of government, directs the fir&s;t legi&s;lature to meet at Annapolis, on Monday the tenth of February 1777. I contend, that from the true con&s;truction of that article and this clau&s;e, taken together, Annapolis is the place fixed for the meeting of the legi&s;lature; and that a di|ligent attention to every other part of the declaration and con&s;titution, which has any relation to the &s;ubject, will evince my po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If the convention did not mean, by the&s;e two parts, to fix the legi&s;lature at Annapolis, it is extremely probable that the 61&s;t clau&s;e would have gone further, and directed the le|gi&s;lature "then and there to appoint a place where it &s;hall be convened in future;" or, "then and there to appoint a place where it &s;hall be held during the war, after which a place &s;hall be fixed, agreeably to the 9th article of the de|claration."</P>
<P>The &s;ure&s;t way of finding the true con&s;truction of a law, admitting of two con&s;tructions, is to examine the con&s;e|quences of each, and this con&s;truction is to be made, from examining and comparing all the different parts. The de|claration and the form of government I con&s;ider as making one law, or which is the &s;ame thing, as con&s;i&s;ting of a va|riety of laws, all having relation to each other, and made by one body of men, at one meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019698_0004_0FADA34A74ADA050">
I fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, What po&s;&s;ible inconvenience or incongruity can flow from my con&s;truction? Can it be conceived, that an injury can re&s;ult to the community by continuing the &s;eat of a government at a place where it has &s;o long been held, until two general a&s;&s;emblies &s;hall concur in an act for its removal? It may indeed be urged, that a wi&s;e, politic a&s;|&s;embly, may &s;ometimes pa&s;s an act tending greatly to the public good, and their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may be &s;o blind, or &s;o perver&s;e, as to with-hold their concurrence; be it &s;o; &s;uppo&s;e then the &s;eat of government removed by this &s;ingle wi&s;e, politic a&s;&s;embly, May not their unworthy &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by another &s;ingle act, undo what they have done? And, if that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, would it not be infinitely better that the thing never had been done?</P>
<P>In &s;upport of my con&s;truction, I maintained, that the con|vention, in the declaration of rights, laid down rules and maxims for their own government, whil&s;t afterwards they &s;hould be framing the con&s;titution, as well as for the govern|ment of all future legi&s;latures, whil&s;t they &s;hould be framing laws; and that part of the 61&s;t clau&s;e of the one was made in obedience to the 9th article of the other. To this I am told, <Q>that it would be ab&s;urd for a body of men to pre&s;cribe rules for their own government.</Q> If &s;o, then almo&s;t every body of men, who have a&s;&s;embled upon any great and extraordinary occa&s;ion, to enter into re&s;olutions which were to have the force of laws, have acted ab&s;urdly; for it has been an univer&s;al practice with &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, in the fir&s;t place, to lay down certain principles, agreeably to which their after re&s;olves were to be framed. Advert only to the proceedings of the congre&s;s and of your late commit|tees, and to the proceedings of the late popular meetings in Ireland. The declaration of rights contains a variety of &s;uch principles, rules and maxims, that were manife&s;tly in|tended for the direction of the convention in framing the con&s;titution, to which that declaration is a &s;pecies of pre|amble. The 5th article a&s;&s;erts, that elections ought to be frequent; the con&s;titution accordingly directs the election of delegates to be annual, &amp;c. The 6th article maintains, that the legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers of government, ought to be for ever &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other; this two is amply provided for by the con&s;titution. Again, the 31&s;t article maintains, that a long continuance in the
<PB N="6" REF="019698_0005_0FADA34B426290B0">fir&s;t-executive departments of power and tru&s;t is dangerous to liberty; accordingly, the con&s;titution directs the governor and council to be annually elected, and does not permit any man to act as governor more than three years out of &s;even.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances mu&s;t certainly e&s;tabli&s;h my principle, that the declaration was intended as a guide to the convention in forming the government, as well as to all future legi&s;latures in framing laws. To me the convention appears to have acted in this re&s;pect, as in almo&s;t every other, like &s;age and enlightened law-givers; and it would be extraordinary in|deed, if the important direction contained in the 9th article of rights &s;hould have been neglected by the convention, when they mu&s;t have known it to be impo&s;&s;ible (as I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew,) for any &s;ucceeding legi&s;lature to put it into execution.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons affect to con&s;ider this 61&s;t clau&s;e, as no part of the con&s;titution. This is plea&s;ant enough! If I attempt to prove, by &s;erious argument, that which is evident in it|&s;elf, I may perhaps induce a belief, that there was &s;ome co|lour for the &s;ugge&s;tion. It is indeed unlucky, that the 61&s;t clau&s;e was not placed immediately after tho&s;e other clau&s;es which re&s;pect the legi&s;lature, as the title which it claims to be con&s;idered as a part of the con&s;titution, would have then been clear and indefea&s;ible.</P>
<P>Say they, the fir&s;t meeting of the legi&s;lature, under that provi&s;ion, was only for a particular purpo&s;e; it was merely to introduce the new government, by appointing an execu|tive, and by filling the other offices. If we admit this, and if the convention, by this 61&s;t clau&s;e, did not intend to fix the place of holding the legi&s;lature, after that fir&s;t meeting the con&s;titution remained almo&s;t as defective as it was before, becau&s;e no place was yet appointed for holding the fir&s;t le|gi&s;lature, to be elected agreeably to the antecedent parts of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Such would be one con&s;equence of the con&s;truction of the Farmer, and his a&s;&s;ociates; attend to another, agreeably to the&s;e antecedent parts of the con&s;titution, there could be no election of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate until the third Monday in September 1781, of cour&s;e, there could be no meeting of the con&s;titu|tional legi&s;lature until the fir&s;t Monday in November in that year, and yet the hou&s;e of delegates was to be cho&s;en five times before that period, on the fir&s;t Monday in October in the years 1777, 1778, 1779, 1780, and 1781; in the four fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="019698_0006_0FADA34C164C7348">years then, the delegates were to be cho&s;en to no purpo&s;e what|ever; in the fifth year, indeed, they might meet the &s;enate, if they would know where to find them. If the convention which was framing, as they thought, a complete form of government, could appoint the fir&s;t con&s;titutional meeting of the legi&s;lature at a period five years di&s;tant, and could leave the place of their fir&s;t meeting to be a&s;certained by tacit and common con&s;ent, they mu&s;t have committed an over&s;ight which no individual of common &s;en&s;e could have po&s;&s;ibly been guilty of.</P>
<P>I agree, nay, I &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain, that the 61&s;t clau&s;e was intended to give life to the new government, and that the con&s;titution was a dead letter without it. How is this done by my opponents con&s;truction? Why the people are to meet for the purpo&s;e of choo&s;ing a &s;pecial a&s;&s;embly, which is to meet on a &s;pecial day to do a particular thing, viz. to appoint all the officers of the government, which government may then go on; advert again, I be&s;eech you, to the con|&s;equences which I have ju&s;t pointed out, and &s;ay, whether a con&s;truction, which involves &s;uch con&s;equences, can po&s;&s;i|bly be right.</P>
<P>I appeal now to tho&s;e, who without prejudice or prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, will attentively peru&s;e the whole &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, whether the following be not the plain and obvious meaning of the convention, in the 61&s;t clau&s;e of the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P><Q>We have already, by the 15th clau&s;e, directed the electors of the &s;enate to meet on the 3d Monday in Sep|tember 1781; and we have directed the people to choo&s;e their immediate repre&s;entatives annually, on the fir&s;t Mon|day in October; now, as the third Monday in September 1781 is di&s;tant almo&s;t five years, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to make a further provi&s;ion, for giving life to that &s;y&s;tem which we have contrived with &s;o much care and attention; we have likewi&s;e, hitherto, omitted to fix the place of hold|ing the legi&s;lature, which the legi&s;lature to &s;ucceed us can|not do, as all their acts are liable to be immediately after re|pealed, either by them&s;elves or their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; we there|fore conclude, by directing the people to choo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;enate on the 25th of November next, who are to meet at Annapolis on the 9th of December next, to elect the &s;enate; and by directing the people in each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to
<PB N="8" REF="019698_0007_0FADA34CB3E7EB08">choo&s;e their delegates on the 18th of the &s;ame month. The a&s;&s;embly, &s;o cho&s;en, is to meet at Annapolis on Monday the 10th of February next, and then, or at &s;ome future &s;e&s;&s;ion, one principle part of their bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be to appoint the executive, and all the other officers of go|vernment, for the fir&s;t time. We thus direct the fir&s;t ap|pointment of the legi&s;lature, for which it is plain, from the 15th clau&s;e, that we had re&s;erved our&s;elves until this la&s;t clau&s;e, we fix the place of their meeting; and it is thus we complete our great and arduous undertaking.</Q></P>
<P>I repeat again and again, the new government could not have been introduced without appointing the place for the general meeting of the legi&s;lature; this 61&s;t clau&s;e is as much a part of the con&s;titution as if it had been placed in the centre, and the con&s;titution having once appointed a place for holding the legi&s;lature, it becomes fixed at that place in the manner intended by the 9th article of rights. It is indeed of importance to the Farmer to prove this 61&s;t clau&s;e to be no part of the con&s;titution, and that it makes no permanent provi&s;ion, becau&s;e the &s;eat of government may then be removed without the odious formality pre&s;cribed for aboli&s;hing or altering any part of the declaration, and the form of government; but, accu&s;tomed as I am to confident a&s;&s;ertions at the bar, this propo&s;ition has more amazed me than any thing I ever yet have heard.</P>
<P>Is this 61&s;t clau&s;e no part of the con&s;titution, becau&s;e it pre&s;cribes the mode in which the new government is to com|mence? Or is it no part, becau&s;e without it the government never could commence? I be&s;eech you, my countrymen, to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly what could have been done without it; you might have a&s;&s;embled on the fir&s;t Monday in October 1777, to choo&s;e your delegates, but that would have been fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e they could enact no law without the &s;enate, and the electors of that branch were not to be a&s;&s;embled until the 3d Monday in September 1781. Well, the year 1781 at la&s;t arrives, and both branches are elected; but where &s;hall they meet, no place being named by the con&s;titution? It is ex|tremely probable a majority will repair to Annapolis, under the expectation of there meeting their fellow members. By what authority are they to &s;it there? It is propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;em|ble and make an ordinance for the purpo&s;e; to this it is re|plied, <Q>the 9th article of rights requires the place for hold|ing
<PB N="9" REF="019698_0008_0FADA34DFB236398">the legi&s;lature to be fixed; this article, like every other, mu&s;t have the force of a law, and is not to be abo|li&s;hed but by two acts of a&s;&s;embly; What is the &s;en&s;e of it? It is, that no act of a&s;&s;embly &s;hall be binding unle&s;s made at a place fixed for our meeting; we are mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly the creatures of the con&s;titution, and mu&s;t act agreeably to its injunctions. But this con&s;titution, which has &s;o long deferred our fir&s;t meeting, has enjoined a thing which its own neglect has rendered impo&s;&s;ible. The be&s;t thing we can do, is to go back to our con&s;tituents, and advi&s;e them to appoint another convention, either to com|plete this form of government, or to frame an entire new &s;y&s;tem.</Q> Says a third, <Q>I accede to your con&s;truction of the 9th article, it contains a provi&s;ion which appears founded in policy, and dictated by experience, but I can|not join in your inference; I rather conclude, that as An|napolis was always the &s;eat of the proprietary government; as it contains every public building requi&s;ite for the go|vernment; as every convention has met at that place; as this very article, and the &s;ub&s;equent con&s;titution, was framed there; as this place &s;eems to have been re|garded with a favourable eye by the 37th article, which &s;ecures it in all its rights, privileges and benefits; tho&s;e circum&s;tances induce me to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from a fair and compre|hen&s;ive con&s;truction of the whole, that Annapolis mu&s;t have been con&s;idered, by the founders of the con&s;titution, as the place fixed for the meeting of the legi&s;lature.</Q> I acknowledge, continues he, <Q>from the 15th clau&s;e of that con&s;titution it would appear, that the framers did not think the place as yet fixed, or at lea&s;t, that they con&s;i|dered the point not yet ab&s;olutely &s;ettled, becau&s;e, they &s;ay the electors &s;hall meet at Annapolis, or &s;uch o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er place as &s;hall be appointed for convening the legi&s;lature. It appears from that very clau&s;e, that they did not perform every thing they intended; they &s;urely could not have in|tended the hou&s;e of delegates to be elected four times before the &s;enate. However, as it is, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it; and it is better to give &s;uch a con&s;truction as will &s;up|port, than &s;uch a one as mu&s;t &s;et a&s;ide, the con&s;titution under which we have here a&s;&s;embled to act.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;uch a manner would the members of the fir&s;t con&s;ti|tutional a&s;&s;embly have probably debated, had the 61&s;t clau&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="019698_0009_0FADA34E52BD39D8">never been framed, and had it been po&s;&s;ible for the people of Maryland to have remained without government, and with|out admini&s;tration of law, during the whole of the memora|ble interval between the 11th of November 1776, when the la&s;t convention was di&s;&s;olved, and the fir&s;t Monday in No|vember 1781, on which day the fir&s;t meeting of the &s;enate, according the 15th clau&s;e, was to take place.</P>
<P>But my antagoni&s;ts may a&s;k, <Q>Why make the&s;e unne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;uppo&s;itions? Although the provi&s;ion, which you call the 61&s;t clau&s;e, be no part of the con&s;titution, it was a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure of the convention, to give motion to the government they had ju&s;t fabricated.</Q> This expo&s;ition will not &s;erve their turn, becau&s;e, if this provi&s;ion were no part of the con&s;titution, it was ab&s;olutely void, for it gives the fir&s;t appointment of the officers of government to the legi&s;lature, and the con&s;titution had ju&s;t before conferred that power on the executive only.</P>
<P>Attend now to the Farmer, he alleges the meeting of the legi&s;lature under this 61&s;t clau&s;e, to have been <Q>&s;pecial, for a &s;pecial purpo&s;e, and to do a particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s; that the intention of it has long been fulfilled; that its operation now cea&s;es to exi&s;t; that it does not expre&s;sly, or by implication, enjoin the legi&s;lature to meet at Anna|poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at any time thereafter; that the meeting was not on the day pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution for its annual meet|ing.</Q> From all this I infer his opinion, that the legi&s;la|ture, at that meeting, could only appoint the executive, and other officers of government; that when this particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patched, this &s;pecial a&s;&s;embly ought to have been di&s;&s;olved, and, of cour&s;e, that no place could have been appointed by that general a&s;&s;embly for the meeting of the con&s;titutional general a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Let it be recorded on your minds, and &s;uffer me to repeat once more, this con&s;titutional general a&s;&s;embly could not have met before the fir&s;t Monday in November 1781, be|cau&s;e, independent of this 61&s;t clau&s;e, the fir&s;t meeting pre|&s;cribed for the electors of the &s;enate, was to take place on the 3d Monday in September 1781; according then to his expo&s;ition of this 61&s;t clau&s;e, the general a&s;&s;embly was to choo&s;e a governor and his council; For how long? For the re&s;idue of the year, &s;ays the clau&s;e. They were likewi&s;e to fill, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, all the offices in the di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="11" REF="019698_0010_0FADA34F0C0EFD88">of the governor and council; For how long? Some of them, &s;ays the antecedent con&s;titution, are of annual appointment, but the judges are to hold their offices during good beha|viour. Let us &s;ee then how all this will work, and what is the con&s;equence of the Farmer's expo&s;ition. The &s;pecial a&s;&s;embly is di&s;&s;olved. The con&s;titutional general a&s;&s;embly cannot meet, as I have before inculcated, until November 1781. The governor and council drop off at the end of the year, which is the &s;econd Monday for the governor, and the &s;econd Tue&s;day for the council, in November 1777; all officers of annual appointment, mu&s;t likewi&s;e cea&s;e to act about the &s;ame time. Well then, Who are left to admi|ni&s;ter the public affairs? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it would indeed be a "fine thing to be a judge," becau&s;e there would perhaps be a nece&s;&s;ity for the judges to exerci&s;e, not only the judi|cial, but the legi&s;lative and executive powers of government. Such would be the ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences of con&s;truing the 61&s;t clau&s;e as no part of the con&s;titution, and of limiting the power of that &s;pecial a&s;&s;embly to the appointment of the officers of government. I think my&s;elf then mo&s;t clearly warranted in denying, that the con&s;titution, without the clau&s;e, would have been a "perfect code of con&s;titutional juri&s;prudence;" and yet, with the Farmer's expo&s;ition, this clau&s;e made the matter hardly a jot the better.</P>
<P>As few of my readers can have an opportunity of peru&s;ing the con&s;titution, I will give them &s;o much of the 61&s;t clau&s;e as it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould &s;ee for the purpo&s;e of forming a judgment on this point. Here are the words: <Q>61. That to introduce the new government, an election be held for the electors of the &s;enate on Monday the twenty-fifth of November in this pre&s;ent year, and that the electors of the &s;enate meet at Annapolis on Monday the ninth of De|cember in this pre&s;ent year, and there choo&s;e &s;ena|tors; and that an election be held on Wedne&s;day the eighteenth of December, for delegates to &s;erve in ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, and for &s;heriffs; and that the &s;aid elections be made by &s;uch per&s;ons, in the &s;ame manner, and under the &s;ame qualifications, as &s;uch elections are <HI>herein</HI> before directed to be made, at the periodical times before men|tioned; the returns of all which fir&s;t elections &s;hall be made to the council of &s;afety for the time being; and the general a&s;&s;embly &s;hall meet at A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">napolis on Monday the

<P>It may not be unworthy of remark, that in the proceed|ings of the convention, each clau&s;e or &s;ection of the con&s;ti|tution is numbered, and this is numbered among the re&s;t, &s;o that not Ari&s;tides only, but the convention it&s;elf, has deemed this a clau&s;e of the con&s;titution, and not merely an after pro|vi&s;ion. The convention having gone through the whole, paragraph by paragraph, declared the whole, at one time, to be the con&s;titution and form of government. How con|temptible then is the a&s;&s;ertion, that this very nece&s;&s;ary clau&s;e is no part of the con&s;titution!</P>
<P>The Farmer ob&s;erves, <Q>that the legi&s;lature has, from time to time, been held at Annapolis for the convenience of the buildings, by common con&s;ent, without the legi&s;la|ture having, by any act, determined that &s;pot for its per|manent re&s;idence.</Q> Would not any per&s;on, unacquainted with the hi&s;tory of our tran&s;actions, &s;uppo&s;ed this fir&s;t &s;pecial a&s;&s;embly was actually di&s;&s;olved, after appointing the officers of government? That no other meeting of a legi&s;lature took place, until the time appointed for the con&s;titutional meet|ing, which I have before &s;hewn could not, agreeably to the Farmer's con&s;truction of this clau&s;e, have taken place until the fir&s;t Monday in November 1781? And that, at this fir&s;t con&s;titutional meeting, the members a&s;&s;embled, by tacit con|&s;ent, at Annapolis?</P>
<P>Very different from all this is the truth. This &s;pecial le|gi&s;lature, elected for a particular purpo&s;e under this &s;pecial provi&s;ion, which is called no part of the con&s;titution, did not confine them&s;elves to that particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s; they con&s;idered them&s;elves con&s;titutionally cho&s;en; that the power of the &s;enate was to continue until that meeting of the electors which is pre&s;cribed by the 15th &s;ection; and that the hou&s;e of delegates was to continue until the fir&s;t Monday of October in the following year, when another election was
<PB N="13" REF="019698_0012_0FADA3506E1EC728">to take place, under the con&s;titution. Accordingly, they not only performed this particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, but they actually &s;at near three months; and, if I be not egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, the Farmer a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their deliberations. In that length of time they pa&s;&s;ed a variety of laws, &s;ome of which are &s;till in force. They adjourned until &s;ome day in the fol|lowing June, without naming a place; they met at the time appointed at Annapolis, and pa&s;&s;ed other laws, and then ad|journed until &s;ome time in September, when their meeting was prevented by an inva&s;ion of the enemy. The &s;ame &s;e|nate met the hou&s;e of delegates, con&s;titutionally elected, on the fir&s;t Monday in October 1777, 1778, 1779, and 1780, and no per&s;on has ever pre&s;umed to arraign them for having u&s;urped an authority. In all that time the general a&s;&s;embly never thought of appointing the place of their own meeting, and for this plain rea&s;on; I pre&s;ume, that they conceived the place fixed, and rea&s;oned on the declaration and form of go|vernment ju&s;t as I do. <Q>The declaration &s;ays, the place of our meeting mu&s;t be fixed; the con&s;titution then appoints a place where the legi&s;lature &s;hall meet. No part of either can be altered, but by the joint act of two a&s;&s;emblies. If then the convention in one part &s;ays, the place ought to be fixed, in another appoints the place where the fir&s;t le|gi&s;lature is to meet, and in a third &s;ays, that all its pro|vi&s;ions mu&s;t &s;tand for a law until they &s;hall be repealed by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive general a&s;&s;emblies, there can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e no rational con&s;truction, but that the legi&s;lature mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> meet at this place, until two a&s;&s;emblies &s;hall concur in appointing ano|ther.</Q> As to the exception in the latter part of the 9th article of the declaration, nobody has yet contended, that it means any thing more, than that the legi&s;lature may appoint a particular meeting at &s;ome other place, when evident ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;hall at any time require it.</P>
<P>As the Farmer &s;eems con&s;tituted, by common con&s;ent, the leading advocate for Baltimore-town, I &s;hall patiently examine every one of his rea&s;ons; I &s;hall not contine my&s;elf to his preci&s;e words, let it &s;uffice that I pre&s;erve his meaning.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, he cannot allow the direction of the 9th article to be given to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e it would be no more than directing them&s;elves.

<P>But, &s;ays the Farmer, <Q>the place mu&s;t be convenient to the members; tho&s;e who are to u&s;e the convenience are the only competent judges of it; be&s;ides, convenience de|pends on after events and circum&s;tances not permanent.</Q> What! Could not the convention judge of the convenience of a place to a&s;&s;emble at and enact laws, when it was it&s;elf a legi&s;lature of the mo&s;t exalted kind? The members of that convention certainly were as good judges of that, as the members of any legi&s;lature can be of the place which will be mo&s;t convenient to its &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; indeed, neither the con|vention, nor any future legi&s;lature, could determine that any place whatever would always remain the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t convenient for men to repair to, and the be&s;t calculated, on every ac|count, for the tran&s;action of public affairs, and therefore the &s;eat of government may, at any time, be removed by the joint act of two general a&s;&s;emblies. The Farmer thinks this 9th article of rights <HI>only declaratory;</HI> by this we are to &s;up|po&s;e that it means nothing, or is to &s;tand for nothing, and at any time may be di&s;pen&s;ed with at the plea&s;ure of the le|gi&s;lature; our con&s;titution, however, that &s;acred palladium of our rights, that &s;trong barrier again&s;t the encroachments of power, expre&s;sly ordains, that no part of the declaration &s;hall be altered by a &s;ingle legi&s;lature; by this is effectually provided, that the declaration of rights &s;hall remain as a law, and that it &s;hall limit the power of the legi&s;lature, which without it might indeed be called omnipotent. The &s;enate, and the repre&s;entatives of the people, derive their power merely from that con&s;titution, and they are delegated to pa&s;s laws in conformity to it; whenever they violate it, by their acts, they betray their tru&s;t, and if it were not for the check which is provided <HI>by &s;ecuring the independence of judges,</HI> in every in&s;tance of an infringement of the declaration or form of government, the whole government would revert to the people. This would be fatal doctrine indeed! As I do not doubt that attempts will hereafter be made to violate the con&s;titution by the arbitrary acts of a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, I
<PB N="15" REF="019698_0014_0FADA35552009CB0">conceive it a fortunate circum&s;tance, that the con&s;titution, without containing explicit terms, has been &s;o well under|&s;tood. The power of the judges to reject any acts that, in their opinion, may be repugnant to any part of the declara|tion or form of government, has been a&s;&s;erted on a great va|riety of occa&s;ions, and has never yet been di&s;puted, except by a &s;ingle writer of Baltimore-town. According to his ideas, it &s;eems, the general a&s;&s;embly is the only judge of tho&s;e parts which re&s;pect it&s;elf; and, if it thinks proper to di&s;regard both, its acts mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be admitted as laws. Such an extravagant opinion could never have entered the head of a rational man. What! Are the men who are to be bound by a law, the propere&s;t to decide on the law? If that be &s;ub&s;tantial doctrine, it was in vain for the re&s;pectable founders of our con&s;titution to be&s;tow &s;uch labour and at|tention on a work calculated to in&s;ure the &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s of their con&s;tituents! It was in vain to expect every part of that work to &s;tand until two a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould concur to overthrow it! But a more rational con&s;truction has hither|to generally prevailed, and it would be a wa&s;te of time to demon&s;trate, that the judges may reject uncon&s;titutional acts, and that, by &s;o doing, they have a countroul over the legi&s;lature, which in other re&s;pects has a controul over them. This controul of the judges does not make them legi&s;lators, it only enables them to re&s;train the proper legi&s;lature within its proper limits, and &s;uch a controul is infinitely preferable to that of the people at large, which could not be exerted without a di&s;&s;olution of the bonds of government.</P>
<P>It may here be proper likewi&s;e to remark, that by accu&s;ing all per&s;ons who would dare to execute any uncon&s;titutional acts, that grand juries would evince their importance.</P>
<P>As the judges then are indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to reject all acts pa&s;&s;ed in an uncon&s;titutional manner, and as many im|portant things may be tran&s;acted under tho&s;e acts before they &s;hall be declared void; as all this may throw our affairs into confu&s;ion, and may bring ruin on individuals, it would &s;ure|ly be prudent for the legi&s;lature, before it adopts the Far|mer's propo&s;ition, to be &s;atisfied, that by removing to Balti|more-town, without publi&s;hing their act three months before a new election, and having that act ratified by a new a&s;&s;em|bly, it will not violate the con&s;titution. For this rea&s;on
<PB N="16" REF="019698_0015_0FADA3567B2EC5A8">Ari&s;tides advi&s;ed them previou&s;ly to con&s;ult the judges, not that he meant him&s;elf to give a judicial opinion. The Farmer expre&s;&s;es a great re&s;pect for the judges, but thinks <Q>it would be ridiculous to require their opinion on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the point is involved in no more difficulty than the que&s;tion whether one hou&s;e can adjourn without the other.</Q> I &s;hall make no comment on the very extraordinary treatment which the Farmer thinks fit to give Ari&s;tides; the proper remark on &s;uch an occa&s;ion can|not fail of &s;ugge&s;ting it&s;elf to the reader.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, that Ari&s;tides was not &s;incere in his con|&s;truction. He di&s;dains the imputation. He never did, and ne|ver will, endeavour to impre&s;s an opinion not entertained by him&s;elf. He offers rea&s;ons which the Farmer promi&s;es to ex|amine, but which the Farmer does not even analize. His opi|nion is confirmed by two of the mo&s;t eminent council at the bar; indeed, by almo&s;t every lawyer with whom he conver&s;es. I cannot, however, be per&s;uaded, that the Farmer's confident a&s;&s;ertions have proceeded altogether from a thorough convicti|on. In this I am clear, that a thorough conviction could not induce any man to decline a reference in which there can be no impropriety, inconvenience or danger. In what a &s;tate &s;hall we be, if a &s;ingle a&s;&s;embly &s;hall undertake to remove the &s;eat of government, and if the acts pa&s;&s;ed by them at Baltimore-town &s;hall be hereafter declared null and void! Tho&s;e who examine the &s;ubject merely on the principles of public good, will allow the advice of Ari&s;tides to be whole&s;ome; but tho&s;e who would &s;tir Heaven and earth to bring about a re|moval of the government, will be at all events for rejecting it. <Q>Let anarchy and confu&s;ion prevail; let even the &s;tate it&s;elf be thrown into a convul&s;ion; let ruin attend every man who may act under tho&s;e uncon&s;titutional mandates; let us involve the legi&s;lative and the judicial departments in a di&s;pute; the &s;maller number mu&s;t &s;oon yield to the re|pre&s;entatives of the people; but if even the&s;e few men &s;hould have firmne&s;s to re&s;i&s;t lawle&s;s acts, no matter, pro|vided we &s;ucceed in this our darling undertaking.</Q> I can|not, however, believe the Farmer capable of thus rea&s;oning within him&s;elf; and I am inclined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think, his &s;upercilious behaviour proceeds merely from the want of due reflection, and a proper under&s;tanding of the con&s;titution and the rules of con&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="019698_0016_0FADA35742C66360">
We &s;hall however be told, I doubt not, that it would de|grade the &s;overeign power to await the approbation of a few men, before it &s;hall dare to act. But let it be remem|bered, that the&s;e few men have the power to re&s;train it within the con&s;titutional limits. We &s;hall be told too, that there are men in the legi&s;lature, equal in legal abilities to the judges. Be it &s;o; but the&s;e men have only each one vote in deciding the que&s;tion; they are not under obligations, equal to tho&s;e of the judges; and it is the opinion of the judges only, which is ultimately to decide.</P>
<P>I return now to my argument. That the convention, by appointing the fir&s;t legi&s;lature to meet at Annapolis, intended to fix that place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature, would to me be &s;ufficiently clear, from this con&s;ideration. They knew that the place could not be fixed by any &s;ucceeding legi&s;lature; becau&s;e any act of one &s;e&s;&s;ion may be abrogated by the next. The word "fixed" is a mo&s;t &s;ignificant term; and, &s;uppo&s;ing my po&s;ition to be right, I admire the wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight of the convention, in preventing artful men, on an occa&s;ion &s;o intere&s;ting to the public, from taking ad|vantage of a critical &s;ea&s;on, of temporary &s;its of di&s;gu&s;t in wa|vering capricious minds, of di&s;&s;eminating tales, which cannot be refuted until it be too late; in preventing men, I &s;ay, from doing that in a hurry, which ought never to be done but upon the mature&s;t deliberation. The convention mu&s;t have been impre&s;&s;ed with an idea of the propriety of fixing the &s;eat of government, even on account of giving &s;ome &s;tability to the real property of the place, where it may happen to be. It would be an unhappy thing, indeed, for the citizens of any capital, if, at every meeting of the legi&s;lature, they are to run the hazard of being in&s;tantly deprived of their property; if their minds are to be thus agitated, if they are to be thus filled with doubts and alarms, and if all &s;pirit of enterprize, is thus to be effectually checked. I will explain what I mean by &s;pirit of enterprize, as it &s;eems that unlucky ex|pre&s;&s;ion in my fir&s;t addre&s;s ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been more commented on, in Baltimore-town, than all the re&s;t of the publication. It was evident, I did not mean to extol "the beloved city" for its enterprize in commerce. My meaning was, that a propo&s;al of removing from it the &s;eat of government, for a time, puts all bu&s;ine&s;s at a &s;tand. Should a man be about to build, he mu&s;t, in prudence, await the event; if his building has
<PB N="18" REF="019698_0017_0FADA3582433D668">already been commenced, he mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend the work; if two men are treating about the &s;ale of a hou&s;e, either the treaty mu&s;t be broken off, or one party will gain an advantage; a vacant hou&s;e mu&s;t remain unoccupied. And when, at la&s;t, the que&s;tion is determined in favour of Annapolis, the appre|hen&s;ion of what may take place at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, cannot fail to affect the value of its hou&s;es and lots, and to ob&s;truct all further growth and improvement. The&s;e are &s;erious evils, and the men who feel them are entitled to as much con&s;ide|ration, as if they inhabited a town of extent, popula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n and enterprize, equal to that of the antient city of Tyre. To me there cannot be a more deci&s;ive proof of an illiberal &s;oul, than the &s;port which has been recently made with the anxieties of the Annapolitans. I appeal even to the &s;ober and re&s;pecta|ble part of Baltimore-town, whether my con&s;truction does not place matters on the proper footing. That the &s;eat of govern|ment may be removed in the way pre&s;cribed for altering any part of the declaration of rights, or form of government, no rational being ever could deny. But if it can be removed by a more compendious method, no man who regards the plain well known import of words, could affirm, that it can be &s;aid to be fixed. And, as at any rate it may be removed by the joint act of two general a&s;&s;emblies, it cannot with pro|priety be called <HI>"immoveable."</HI> My con&s;truction, therefore, I conceive, is not only the mo&s;t rational, but the mo&s;t con|venient. It affords a &s;ecurity again&s;t whim and caprice; it may prevent a variety of evils; and it allows a &s;afe remedy, whenever circum&s;tances &s;hall render the further holding of the legi&s;lature at the fixed place a public grievance.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of a capital town is &s;urely a mea&s;ure which no body of men &s;hould have it in their power ha&s;tily to adopt; and, happily, our con&s;titution has taken care to prevent the legi&s;lature from proceeding with ha&s;te in almo&s;t every thing that very materially affects our rights and in|tere&s;ts. When two general a&s;&s;emblies, after a mature de|liberation, &s;hall concur in any mea&s;ure, it is more than pro|bable that the mea&s;ure will be right; and, if it be probable, that two general a&s;&s;emblies will concur in the propo&s;ed act for removing the &s;eat of government, the citizens of Anna|polis will be able to fore&s;ee, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to pre|pare for the event, of which the Farmer, with &s;uch confi|dence and exultation, undertakes to give them warning.
<PB N="19" REF="019698_0018_0FADA358B1D3D048">And after lo&s;ing the &s;eat of government in this way, they will, perhaps, renounce the fond idea of regaining it, at a future &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the Farmer may perhaps &s;ay, <Q>admitting it might have been good policy for the convention to have fixed the &s;eat of government at Annapolis, or any where el&s;e, <HI>if words be &s;uffered to retain their meaning,</HI> this power has been conferred by the con&s;titution on the future legi&s;lature.</Q> Ob&s;erve, &s;ays he in his fir&s;t addre&s;s, <Q>the electors of the &s;enate are to meet <HI>at &s;uch other place as the legi&s;lature &s;hall appoint.</HI></Q> The opinion I entertain of the Farmer's inte|grity, will not permit me, one moment, to &s;uppo&s;e him guilty of a wilful mi&s;quotation. Such words are found no where in the con&s;titution, and had its framers really intended to confer this power on the legi&s;lature, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that they never did it by plain and po&s;itive terms. Although in &s;everal places they &s;peak of the place to be appointed for holding the legi&s;lature, they no where have &s;aid, this appoint|ment &s;hall be in the legi&s;lature; and yet they often &s;peak of things to be done by a future legi&s;lature. The&s;e con&s;idera|tions are &s;ufficient to evince, that they intended them&s;elves to fix the place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The words of the 15th clau&s;e are the&s;e, <Q>That the &s;aid electors of the &s;enate &s;hall meet at the city of Annapolis, or &s;uch other place as &s;hall be appointed for convening the legi&s;lature, on the third Monday in September 1781, and on the &s;ame day in every fifth year for ever thereafter.</Q> I was fully apprized of this clau&s;e, but did not e&s;teem it ma|terial for either &s;ide. I now find it of importance to my ar|gument. Ob&s;erve, &s;ay I, this 15th &s;ection is antecedent to the 61&s;t; no &s;ection before this gives the lea&s;t hint where the &s;eat of government &s;hall be; this &s;ection does not declare by whom the appointment &s;hall be made, it directs a meet|ing of the electors at a period five years di&s;tant from its own date; and the 61&s;t clau&s;e afterwards appoints a meeting of the electors at Annapolis, at a very near period, and a meeting of the legi&s;lature likewi&s;e at Annapolis. Does not all this "mo&s;t forcibly inculcate and impre&s;s on every un|prejudiced mind," that the convention, at the time of framing the 15th clau&s;e, intended to do that, which neither in that, nor in any other part, they have directed the legi&s;lature to do; that by giving directions for a meeting of the electors
<PB N="20" REF="019698_0019_0FADA3599092E3B0">five years di&s;tant, they re&s;erved them&s;elves for giving direc|tions as to the fir&s;t meeting of the electors, until they &s;hould come to the la&s;t clau&s;e, which was to introduce the govern|ment; that this clau&s;e was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; that, without it the con&s;titution was not a "perfect code;" that, without it, the fixing of the place for holding the legi&s;lature, which they had before a&s;&s;erted to be nece&s;&s;ary, has not been, and never can be done; finally, that, if he, who made the notable di&s;covery of the 61&s;t clau&s;e being no part of the con&s;titution, can &s;upport his opinion, he de&s;erves from Balti|more-town much <HI>credit</HI> for his ingenuity.</P>
<P>The Farmer has derived an argument from the 56th &s;ection of the form of government, of which he gives &s;uch an extract, as he thought &s;uited his own purpo&s;e, <Q>That the general court &s;hall &s;it for tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;uch prices as the future legi&s;lature of this &s;tate &s;hall direct and appoint.</Q> Now, &s;ays he, <Q>the 9th article of the decla|ration requires the legi&s;lature to be held at a place mo&s;t convenient to the depo&s;itory of the public records, and the records of the general court are part thereof.</Q> From all this he infers, that had the framers of the con&s;titution in|tended to fix the place of holding the legi&s;lature, they would have likewi&s;e fixed the place of holding the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>The convention, we may &s;uppo&s;e, found a difficulty in choo&s;ing a place for the court on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and had not them&s;elves yet fixed a place for holding the legi&s;lature. It was merely on this account, I pre&s;ume, that they gave the appointment of a place on each &s;hore to the future legi&s;|lature. They would not make di&s;tinctions between the
<PB N="21" REF="019698_0020_0FADA35AC1AE6B80">&s;hores; for, had they appointed a place for the we&s;tern &s;hore, the court would have been <HI>fixed</HI> there; whereas no future legi&s;lature could <HI>fix</HI> the place for the ea&s;tern &s;hore. I now a&s;k, if the convention intended that a future legi&s;lature &s;hould fix the place of holding the legi&s;lature, why it did not &s;ay &s;o in explicit terms, &s;uch as they have made u&s;e of with re&s;pect to the general court? Had indeed this 56th &s;ection &s;aid, <Q>the general court for the we&s;tern &s;hore &s;hall be held at the place hereafter to be appointed by the legi&s;lature for its own meeting,</Q> it would have precluded all argument in &s;upport of my po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The fact is. The con&s;titution no where expre&s;sly directs the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice, and the legi&s;lature, to be held at the &s;ame place; and hence it became nece&s;&s;ary for the le|gi&s;lature, by a particular act, to direct where the&s;e courts &s;hall be held. But if it be clear, that the convention in|tended the legi&s;lature and the general court to be held at the &s;ame place, and any argument can be drawn from the opi|nion of the fir&s;t legi&s;lature, compo&s;ed in a great mea&s;ure of tho&s;e who had been members of the la&s;t convention, the act for appointing the place for holding the&s;e courts is highly worthy of attention. That act was pa&s;&s;ed at the fir&s;t meet|ing of the legi&s;lature, which the Farmer maintains, was held only for a &s;pecial purpo&s;e. And if their con&s;truction and the Farmer's be the &s;ame, that the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice and the legi&s;lature are directed by the con&s;titution to be held at the &s;ame place, they have, by implication, given a mo&s;t de|cided opinion in favour of Ari&s;tides; for they have ordained, that the court of appeals, and the general court for the we&s;|tern &s;hore, &s;hall be for ever held at Annapolis. By &s;o doing, they mu&s;t have thought Annapolis already fixed for the hold|ing of the legi&s;lature, or they would, at the &s;ame time, have pa&s;&s;ed an act for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If they conceived Annapolis appointed by the 61&s;t clau&s;e for their fir&s;t meeting only, no body of men ever acted &s;o &s;trange a part; for they pa&s;&s;ed no act for appointing the the place where the legi&s;lature &s;hould be held in future; no bill was framed for the purpo&s;e in either hou&s;e, no me&s;&s;age on the &s;ubject was &s;ent by either hou&s;e, and, at the end of the journal of each hou&s;e, is an adjournment to an early day, without naming the place. From all this ari&s;es an implica|tion, &s;trong as the mo&s;t po&s;itive words, that this a&s;&s;embly
<PB N="22" REF="019698_0021_0FADA35B1AA4ADC0">con&s;idered the &s;eat of government to have been fixed by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ettled rule of con&s;truction, that the &s;en&s;e of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw mu&s;t be collected from the words alone, where tho&s;e carry any meaning con&s;i&s;tent with the general intent of the law. The que&s;tion is, what did the convention mean by &s;aying the legi&s;lature &s;hall meet at Annapolis on the tenth of Fe|bruary text? Does it mean thereby to fix the general place of meeting? I &s;ay yes, becau&s;e that is con&s;i&s;tent with the intention clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the 9th article of the declara|tion, and becau&s;e that article could not otherwi&s;e have the force of a law.</P>
<P>Says the Farmer, "that article is only <HI>declaratory.</HI>" I reply, that article, as well as every other article in the de|claration of rights, is by the con&s;titution made a law, irrevocable, except by the joint act of two general a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>All the articles of the declaration are, I confe&s;s, <HI>declara|tory,</HI> and there needs no Farmer to tell us that. But what con&s;titutes them laws is, that no act of a &s;ingle a&s;&s;embly, repugnant to the rules, maxims and principles, which they contain, &s;hall have the force of a law. Well then, the next a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;es an act for removing the &s;eat of government to Baltimore-town. I maintain, that it is repugnant to the 9th article of rights, which &s;ays the place for holding the le|gi&s;lature ought to be fixed. The proper mode for the a&s;|&s;embly to proceed by, in removing the &s;eat of government, would be, to pa&s;s an act for repealing that article, and to &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the people three months be|fore a new election. And if that act be confirmed by the &s;ucceeding a&s;&s;embly, then may an act pa&s;s for removing the &s;eat of government. Or, the act it&s;elf for removing the &s;eat of government, as it would amount to a repeal of the 9th article, might be publi&s;hed for the con&s;ideration of the people.</P>
<P>But had the 61&s;t &s;ection of the con&s;titution never been pa&s;&s;ed by the convention, and had the a&s;&s;embly been con|&s;tantly held at Annapolis, without the direction of the con&s;ti|tution, or any a&s;&s;embly which has &s;ince been held, ina&s;much as the 9th article &s;ays the place ought to be fixed, I might even in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;afely maintain, that the uniform practice and u&s;age of the a&s;&s;embly has fixed the &s;eat of government at
<PB N="23" REF="019698_0022_0FADA35BE0858020">Annapolis; and that it cannot be removed, unle&s;s in one of the ways which I have pointed out.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that the 9th article of rights had never been in&s;erted, I think, even in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it might well be main|tained, that a &s;ingle legi&s;lature could not appoint Baltimore for the place of meeting, becau&s;e the la&s;t &s;ection of the con|&s;titution has appointed Annapolis the place for holding the legi&s;lature. That &s;ection directs the fir&s;t legi&s;lature to meet at Annapolis on a certain day, and pre&s;cribes a particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s which it is to do at that, or at <HI>&s;ome future &s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Does this look as if the convention intended it to be a &s;pecial legi&s;lature, appointed to do one &s;pecial act and no other, and that a future legi&s;lature might meet wherever they might happen or might agree to a&s;&s;emble? But I have already pointed out the con&s;equences of con&s;idering the fir&s;t legi&s;lature in that light; and I dare &s;ay even the Farmer will be convinced, that the fir&s;t legi&s;lature did right in proceed|ing to every other act of legi&s;lation. Well then, the fir&s;t legi&s;lature cho&s;en under the con&s;titution, is by that con&s;titu|tion directed to meet at Annapolis. It is doing no violence to the rules of con&s;truction, and it is agreeable to common &s;en&s;e, to maintain, that the con&s;titution intended the future meetings of that legi&s;lature &s;hould be there, that all future le|gi&s;latures &s;hould meet there, and that no legi&s;lature can be held at any other place before that implied direction of the con&s;titution be repealed in the manner which the con&s;ti|tution pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>It is another rule of con&s;truction, that every word in a law, if po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be con&s;trued &s;o as to convey a meaning. But, without my con&s;truction, the word "fixed," in the 9th article, has no meaning at all. It is totally di&s;carded, and then the clau&s;e &s;tands thus, <Q>that a place for the meet|ing of the legi&s;lature ought to be the mo&s;t convenient,</Q> &amp;c. And then, if it were not for the 61&s;t clau&s;e, the legi&s;lature might move about as it plea&s;ed, always taking care, never|thele&s;s, to carry with it the public records, and to pitch on a place mo&s;t convenient to the members.</P>
<P>When the meaning of the law-makers, after a careful con&s;ideration of every part, &s;till remains a doubt, a recour&s;e to the hi&s;tory of the times is &s;aid to be proper. An honour|able member of the pre&s;ent &s;enate, who was a delegate to the la&s;t convention, has declared, he would mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly
<PB N="24" REF="019698_0023_0FADA35C73113248">have oppo&s;ed the fixing of the &s;eat of government, had he di&s;covered &s;uch an intent in the convention. Another ho|nourable member of the &s;ame body, who likewi&s;e had a &s;hare in fabricating the con&s;titution, has a&s;&s;ured me, that had he conceived the &s;eat of government not to be fixed by the con|&s;titution as it &s;tands, he would have in&s;i&s;ted for more expli|cit terms. I greatly re&s;pect both the&s;e honourable gentle|men, and I mention their different ideas, to &s;hew how little &s;atisfaction could be obtained by an appeal to the founders of the con&s;titution. Should this point be ever brought before a court of ju&s;tice, the&s;e gentlemen, I am per&s;uaded, would never be interrogated by the judges.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude my argument on the con&s;titution with one more ob&s;ervation, and with a brief recapitulation of what I have before &s;aid. Admitting the &s;eat of government not to be fixed in the manner I contend, it may be re|moved to Baltimore-town without even the formality of an act. By me&s;&s;age the two hou&s;es may agree to adjourn to meet at that place. At the next &s;e&s;&s;ion they may in the &s;ame manner adjourn back to Annapolis. If the convention did not mean them&s;elves to fix the &s;eat of government, they mu&s;t have &s;een that the 9th article of rights was entirely u&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e the act of any future legi&s;lature for that purpo&s;e, in whatever terms it might be expre&s;&s;ed, could not prevent their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, or even them&s;elves, from removing it in the very next &s;e&s;&s;ion. But the convention intended no part of their work to be u&s;ele&s;s. They intended the 9th article to have &s;ome effect; and every article is to remain a law, until it be repealed by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;emblies. But that article has no operation, unle&s;s it has by it&s;elf fixed the &s;eat of govern|ment; or unle&s;s the con&s;titution has appointed a place which an&s;wers its de&s;cription; or unle&s;s the place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature be fixed by uniform practice and u&s;age. The con&s;titution appoints Annapolis for the meeting of the fir&s;t legi&s;lature, and that place, in every re&s;pect, an&s;wers the de&s;cription of the 9th article. By appointing that meeting, it meant to a&s;certain the place at which the legi&s;lature &s;hould always meet, unle&s;s on evident nece&s;&s;ity, when it might adjourn, for one meeting only, to &s;ome other place. The provi&s;ion, in the latter part of the 9th article, for ca&s;es of evident ne|ce&s;&s;ity, was peculiarly adapted to the time when the con&s;ti|tution was framed, when an inva&s;ion of the enemy might
<PB N="25" REF="019698_0024_0FADA35D4B80DEB8">every moment be expected. My con&s;truction places every thing on a proper footing, and grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es every part of the declaration of rights, and the form of government; and the conduct of every legi&s;lature &s;ince the convention evinces, that they have made the &s;ame con&s;truction with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thinking as Ari&s;tides does on this important point, under a firm per&s;uation that the con&s;titution has fixed the &s;eat of government at Annapolis, and fearing that the legi&s;lature might do an act which would involve the &s;tate in anarchy and confu&s;ion, he conceived his duty as a citizen, obliged him to declare his opinion, although not called upon in a judicial way. He may perhaps have acted an imprudent part. He may have hazarded &s;ome part of that reputation which he has been con&s;tantly and gradually acquiring. But con&s;iderations like the&s;e &s;hall never deter him from his duty. <HI>If he cannot maintain the good opinion of men, without acting in conformity to their views, he mu&s;t con&s;ole him&s;elf with the purity of his motives.</HI> In his judicial character he never can receive, as a law, any act of the general a&s;&s;embly, which may be repugnant to his &s;en&s;e of the con&s;titution, unle&s;s he be fir&s;t over-ruled by his a&s;&s;ociates, or by a &s;uperior tribunal. At the &s;ame time, he is &s;atisfied that his a&s;&s;ociates will deem binding no acts, which the legi&s;lature can be induced to pa&s;s, in direct violation of the con&s;titution. And he has that opinion of their firmne&s;s and integrity, that as guardians of the &s;acred palladium of our rights, he is per&s;uaded they will ever &s;tand up again&s;t the encroachments and u&s;urpation of any body of men whatever.</P>
<P>The Farmer cannot be &s;o far blinded, by having his eyes continually fixed on this favourite object, as to deny the con|trol of the judges. I demand of him then, what would be the re&s;ult, &s;hould a &s;ingle legi&s;lature attempt to pa&s;s the pro|po&s;ed act into a law, and &s;hould the judges adopt the con|&s;truction of Ari&s;tides, and reject all their acts pa&s;&s;ed at Baltimore-town?</P>
<P>In &s;pite then of the Farmer's confidence, I do not imagine the &s;ucceeding legi&s;lature, for the &s;ake of gratifying the eager wi&s;hes of Baltimore-town, will do an act which may hazard a revolution of the government. Should they be of opinion, that a removal of the &s;eat of government is a mea&s;ure which the public good ab&s;olutely demands, they will act in one of
<PB N="26" REF="019698_0025_0FADA35E2417AB78">the following ways. They will pa&s;s an act, and publi&s;h it three months before a new election. Or they will demand of the whole judicial body, whether a &s;ingle legi&s;lature has the power to remove the &s;eat of government; and if the de|ci&s;ion of the judges &s;hall be in the affirmative, the legi&s;lature will then pa&s;s a common act, or a re&s;olve, for meeting at Baltimore-town.</P>
<P>It will naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I con&s;ider this point of &s;ingular importance. I indeed view it in that light. For, if two a&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t concur, before the removal of the go|vernment can be effected, there will be little danger of &s;ur|prize, or fine&s;&s;e. The citizens of Annapolis can never be greatly di&s;turbed, until the fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed the act; and a few defeats cannot fail to damp the ardour of its adver&s;aries. In the mean time, it may advance to that degree of improvement of which it is yet capable; and it may attain the very little it wants, of exactly an&s;wering the de&s;cription, which a di&s;intere&s;ted enlightened politician would give of a capital be&s;t &s;uited to a republic, like that of Maryland.</P>
<P>Its adver&s;aries will endeavour to impre&s;s an idea, that &s;hould a &s;ingle legi&s;lature, by its arbitrary fiat, transfer the &s;eat of government, the judges would be compelled, from nece&s;&s;ity, to give all the acts of the legi&s;lature, whether con|&s;titutional or not, the &s;tamp of their authority. Be a&s;&s;ured that this is a vain idea. But in the fir&s;t place, where is the inducement for the members of the legi&s;lature to violate their own &s;olemn oaths? Where is the propriety of precipitating this very important mea&s;ure, when the preparatory &s;teps, re|commended by Ari&s;tides, even if they may con&s;titutionally be di&s;pen&s;ed with, would be attended with &s;o little delay, and when the&s;e &s;teps would remove every ground of com|plaint?</P>
<P>Had the declaration of rights, and the form of govern|ment, been both &s;ilent on this head, it would, notwith&s;tand|ing, be &s;ound policy to adopt no weighty mea&s;ure that does not require ha&s;te, without u&s;ing the method pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution for the alteration of any part of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are two parts of that con&s;titution which will excite the admiration of your late&s;t po&s;terity. The fir&s;t is the re|fined mode of electing a &s;enate. The other is the &s;alutary provi&s;ion for preventing ha&s;ty innovations, and the premature
<PB N="27" REF="019698_0026_0FADA360CD169218">adoption of all momentous mea&s;ures. May you always po&s;&s;e&s;s a due &s;en&s;e of its value, and may it protect the rights and &s;ecure the happine&s;s <HI>of you and your po&s;terity, till time &s;hall be no more.</HI></P>

<P>I PROCEED to examine the con&s;equences which will flow from a removal of the &s;eat of government, &s;uppo&s;ing it effected in a con&s;titutional way. The Farmer repre&s;ents, that this mea&s;ure will render an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the citi|zens of Annapolis, by curing them of their dependent ways, and by compelling them to adopt the habits of indu&s;try. His want of candour, or rather his want of reflection, will appear on the &s;lighte&s;t attention to their real &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Annapolis, we may conjecture, had a beginning like mo&s;t other towns within the &s;tate. A tavern, or a black&s;mith's &s;hop, may have fir&s;t been erected on the &s;pot, and occa&s;ion|ed &s;ome little re&s;ort. A few trade&s;men then, of different kinds, needing occa&s;ionally the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, and thinking it a likely place to gain employment, may have cho&s;en it for a &s;tand. It might then tempt a merchant or two to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;tore, and thus, by degrees, a &s;mall village may have been formed. We know from record and tradi|tion, that in a &s;hort time its advantages induced the former government there to fix its &s;eat, and to procure for it a char|ter of incorporation from the Briti&s;h throne. Annapolis then, compared to cotemporary towns, &s;oon became a flou|ri&s;hing place. The officers of government found it conve|nient to &s;ettle there. The&s;e men, with the concour&s;e of people at &s;tated periods, encouraged a competent number of trade&s;men and mechanics to fix at a place where there was a certain pro&s;pect of employment. Hence it is that a con&s;i|derable number of hou&s;es had there been erected. But let it be remembered, although it was thought well &s;ituated for commerce, that commerce never thrived at Annapolis, after it became the &s;eat of government. The con&s;ideration of its being the re&s;idence of in&s;olent great men, and the apprehen|&s;ion of being entirely over-&s;hadowed, deterred many plain, independent, enterpri&s;ing men, from &s;ettling there; and it mu&s;t be obvious, that the re&s;idence of the government has been unfavourable to it as a commercial town.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="019698_0027_0FADA361F7E6CA80">
This was the &s;tate of Annapolis at the commencement of the conte&s;t with Great-Britain. In the cour&s;e of the war, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reat mea&s;ure, abandoned. But all dangers be|ing pa&s;t, and the &s;eat of both governments having always re|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed there, it has at this time rather more inhabitants than it had before the revolution. A very great majority of the&s;e depend not on government immediately for &s;upplies. Their &s;ole dependence is the property they have already ac|quired, and the further &s;ucce&s;sful pro&s;ecution of their dif|ferent trades and profe&s;&s;ions. The men whom a connexion with government has occa&s;ioned to re&s;ide at the capital; the men whom periodical meetings of the general a&s;&s;embly and &s;uperior courts, or the public offices and records, attract to Annapolis; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, at pre&s;ent afford employment to its private citizens. Some of the&s;e citizens have laboured with &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;craped together wherewithal to build or purcha&s;e a habitation. Others, more &s;ucce&s;sful, have ac|quired a number of tenements, which they lea&s;e. Scarcely a &s;ingle hou&s;e is now &s;tanding, that was not built on account of its being the re&s;idence of government. Well then. A law pa&s;&s;es for transferring the &s;eat of government to another place. What is the certain con&s;equence? The immediate dependents on government, having nothing to detain them at Annapolic, repair to the new capital. There is now no|thing left to occa&s;ion, at any time, a concour&s;e of people at the old capital. The merchants, trade&s;men and mechanics, mu&s;t abandon it, to &s;eek employment el&s;ewhere. They have once more to begin the world, and for that purpo&s;e, they too will perhaps follow the government, provided they have a &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of remaining &s;trength, and provided the &s;eve|rity of the blow hath not deprived them altogether of courage a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d hope. Tho&s;e dwellings, on which the owners may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">au&s;ted the whole fruits of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir toil, are left to moul|der for want of tenants; and tho&s;e more wealthy citizens, who have expended their &s;ub&s;tance in erecting tenements for rent, mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain a heavier lo&s;s than they might &s;uffer from an earthquake, a deluge, a bombardment, or the incur&s;ion of the mo&s;t barbarous piratical enemy. It were in vain for Annapolic, at this time, to expect an indemnification from commerce, for that has long &s;ince centred with its a&s;piring neighbour. What is there then to prevent it from exhibit|ing, in a few years, gloomy piles of ruins? And what is
<PB N="29" REF="019698_0028_0FADA3638E9F2A00">there to prevent it from becoming a &s;ad monument of that policy, which, however beneficial it &s;hall have proved to another town, was fatal to a great number of hone&s;t merito|rious citizens.</P>
<P>Is not this, my countrymen, a probable &s;tate of con&s;e|quences? Does it at all re&s;emble the Farmer's? Can you po&s;|&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e, that almo&s;t every man in Annapolis is imme|diately fed by the public, and that the only con&s;equence of the removal of the government would be the laying him un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of labouring, like his neighbours, for a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence? The truth is, that the &s;mall proportion of the citi|zens who depend immediately on the trea&s;ury for &s;upplies, would the lea&s;t of all be injured by the mea&s;ure, &s;ince they would not by the removal be deprived of their employments.</P>
<P>The citizens of Annapolis are, notwith&s;tanding, under &s;ome obligation to the Farmer. He purpo&s;es to convert the &s;tadt-hou&s;e into a college, which he thinks, may alone fal&s;ify the "<HI>prophetic</HI> mournful <HI>prediction</HI>" of Ari&s;tidas. But you &s;urely mu&s;t remark, how poor a compen&s;ation this would be for the lo&s;s of the government. A college can have little influence on the value of private buildings, becau&s;e the &s;tu|dents from the country are to board in the college buildings. It would afford little cu&s;tom to &s;hopkeepers and trade&s;men, becau&s;e the young gentlemen at &s;chool will be &s;upplied with mo&s;t nece&s;&s;aries, at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when they &s;hall vi&s;it their parents. In &s;hort, the college would detain and &s;upport few indeed of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>But wherefore the in&s;titution of a &s;eminary of learning, renders it expedient or more proper to remove the &s;eat of government from Annapolis, does not yet clearly appear. Should this &s;eminary be actually perfected, con|trary to the <HI>well grounded apprehen&s;ions</HI> of Ari&s;tides; &s;hould youths be &s;ent thither from all parts to which its fame &s;hall reach; there will be a &s;ingular advantage to them, and of cour&s;e to the community, in permitting the &s;eat of go|vernment to remain where it is.</P>
<P>That you want men of abilities to conduct your affairs, is a &s;ad and acknowledged truth!</P>
<P>The preamble of the act for founding this college, pro|po&s;es an advantage to the &s;tate in training up and perpe|tuating a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able and hone&s;t men for performing
<PB N="30" REF="019698_0029_0FADA36403257738">the various offices and duties of life. The art of govern|ment, that mo&s;t noble, mo&s;t u&s;eful, mo&s;t difficult of all &s;ciences, may be &s;tudied with peculiar advantage at a capital like Annapolis. Ob&s;ervation and experience may be here combined with theory; and example, in this, as well as in every thing el&s;e, is infinitely &s;uperior to the &s;age&s;t pre|cepts. Be&s;ides, that man has a deplorable idea of education, who does not comprehend in it both manners and a know|ledge of the world. The Farmer does not pre&s;ume to deny, that Annapolis is the &s;eat of elegance, propriety, and re&s;me|ment of manners, although he &s;neers at the&s;e advantages, as if there were nothing &s;olid, &s;ub&s;tantial or prai&s;e-worthy, in|dependent of wealth. He was not aware of the extent of his conce&s;&s;ions. Nothing forms manners as well as example, and Annapolis affords the be&s;t patterns in the &s;tate. There is nothing more advantageous in a republic, where every per&s;on mu&s;t depend on him&s;elf for advancement, than a knowledge of the world; and, to acquire this knowledge, there is nothing more proper than to attend public a&s;&s;emblies where order and decency are invariably pre&s;erved. At the numerous public a&s;&s;emblies in Annapolis, good order is ever maintained. Annapolis, on account of its &s;ize and popula|tion, is preci&s;ely the place for a college. It is not &s;o large as that every &s;tudent may not be known to the inhabitants; and it is not &s;o &s;mall but that the whole body of &s;tudents may be always overawed from breaking forth into riots. But remove the &s;eat of government, and Annapolis, in a little time, will lo&s;e every advantage, and with re&s;pect to forming the manners of youth, or teaching them a proper knowledge of mankind, would be little &s;uperior to the remote&s;t corner of the &s;tate. The college would lo&s;e that &s;ingular advantage of having vi&s;itors on the &s;pot capable of &s;uperintending its ma&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors. The&s;e vi&s;itors, at pre&s;ent, may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by others, who occa&s;ionally come thither on public and private bu&s;ine&s;s; and the idea of excelling in the eyes of the&s;e men, will be a &s;trong incentive to the &s;tudents. But after a removal of the government, it will be difficult at any time to procure a meeting of vi&s;itors, and when met, they will not remain long enough to in&s;pect the affairs of the col|lege, to concert proper regulations, to di&s;cover and reform abu&s;es. In &s;hort, when Annapolis &s;hall become an ob&s;cure and decayed village, the college, in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="31" REF="019698_0030_0FADA3652E8C61C0">highe&s;t reputation, will in all probability be one of the la&s;t &s;eminaries to which a judicious man will choo&s;e to &s;end his &s;on.</P>
<P>A young man, with a thorough knowledge of all that is taught in the &s;chools, who has acquired neither manners nor &s;ome tincture of the knowledge of mankind, is &s;carcely more fit to advance him&s;elf in the world, than if he were ju&s;t brought from the nur&s;ery. He has tho&s;e things yet to learn which are &s;eldom well acquired after early manhood. His Latin, Greek, mathematics, &amp;c. without the&s;e, are mere learned lumber, and may rather di&s;qualify him from making that figure which the fond imagination of a parent may have &s;o often pictured. I need not enlarge on a &s;ubject which has been &s;o often handled by men of &s;uperior talents. Expe|rience too has given men proper ideas. And you particu|larly, my countrymen, who are intere&s;ted in making Saint John's college the theatre of education, mu&s;t join me in opinion, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it at the capital, &s;o far from operating as an argument for a removal of the govern|ment, affords a mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive rea&s;on again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It has yielded me much &s;ecret amu&s;ement, to contemplate the zeal of &s;ome gentlemen for fixing the college at Anna|polis. I mu&s;t think, that for once they have tripped in their politics. At the &s;ame time, I cannot but lament the oppo|&s;ition which is made to <HI>immediately &s;etting on foot the build|ings.</HI> I can account for it but in one way. Your repre|&s;entatives are to be addre&s;&s;ed to the following effect.</P>
<P><Q>By the removal of the &s;eat of government, the public will incur not one farthings expence, as the town and county of Baltimore will generou&s;ly undertake to erect noble and &s;pacious buildings, which they will pre&s;ent to the government. On the contrary, you will ob&s;erve, that by the&s;e means the public may be a gainer. The &s;tadt-hou&s;e will &s;erve admirably for a college, and by transferring it to the vi&s;itors, the public may be exonerated from the payment of &s;ome part of the &pound;.1750 0 0 which it is now obliged annually to contribute.</Q></P>
<P>Here too, I tru&s;t, is a lo&s;t hope. A majority of the vi&s;i|tors, acting like vi&s;itors and men of &s;en&s;e, would never think of converting the &s;tadt-hou&s;e into a college, as its &s;ituation, independent of any other circum&s;tance, makes it extremely unfit for the purpo&s;e, and as their funds are too ample, to

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tho&s;e who calculate on a &s;aving to the &s;tate, would do well to con&s;ider the lo&s;s which the revenue would &s;u&s;tain by &s;inking the value of the real property in Annapolis.

I will, on this head, &s;ugge&s;t another thing to your con&s;ideration; Baltimore-town may make large pro|mi&s;es, it may enter into exten&s;ive engagements, and, I doubt not, it means perfectly fair; but without wi&s;hing to irritate its inhabitants, I cannot help entertaining doubts as to its exact and punctual performance. At any rate, if the government mu&s;t be removed, for the &s;ake of common &s;en&s;e let it remain until the&s;e &s;ame buildings &s;hall be prepared for its reception. I am &s;ufficiently &s;killed in politics to be &s;atisfied, that the&s;e buildings will never be completed at the expence of a &s;ingle town and county. Let them once obtain their wi&s;hes, and they will di&s;cover, how mean a thing it were for the &s;tate to impo&s;e burthens on a part for the good of the whole; and one of the fir&s;t things in which Baltimore-town will exert its influence in the legi&s;lature, will be to relea&s;e it&s;elf from an unrea&s;onable engagement. Nay, I make no doubt, that for the money di&s;bur&s;ed in the beginning, it will have even the addre&s;s to procure a compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>That the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure will be attended with the hap|py effects of extending commerce, increa&s;ing the value of your lands, and pre&s;erving an equilibrium with the powerful neighbouring &s;tates, is with great &s;olemnity predicted by the Farmer. As his predictions are not upon a footing with tho&s;e of the antient prophets, it was incumbent on him to &s;hew, that the&s;e things mu&s;t unavoidably take place from mere natural cau&s;es. The que&s;tion between him and Ari&s;ti|des is not &s;imply, whether it were beneficial for the &s;tate to improve its commerce and agriculture, and thereby to aug|ment the value of its lands. God forbid that Ari&s;tides &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to the pro&s;perity of his country! God forbid that
<PB N="33" REF="019698_0032_0FADA3663B941EF8">a mere local attachment, the prejudice of long re&s;idence, or even his private friend&s;hips, &s;hould make him oppo&s;e the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing that pro&s;perity. He is per&s;uaded, that this &s;tate may yet con&s;iderably increa&s;e its riches, without entailing on it&s;elf the evils concomitant to exce&s;&s;ive wealth; and he wi&s;hes to increa&s;e its riches to that preci&s;e point, be|yond which they cannot be extended, without de&s;troying tho&s;e virtues, and that &s;implicity and purity of manners, which are e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of a genuine repub|lic.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tides does not deal in generals. They may well &s;erve to deceive and mi&s;lead, but they are of little u&s;e in a faithful inquiry after truth. It is from a patient attention to details, that right information is to be acquired. A habit of calcu|lation too, which he did not &s;uppo&s;e would be thought ridicu|lous by the advocate of a commercial town, is of excellent u&s;e to detect fallacy, and to prevent us from being the dupes of an over heated imagination. Let us then con&s;ider calmly, what would be the con&s;equences to Baltimore-town, and to the &s;tate at large, of acceding to the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, &s;up|po&s;ing that the influence of Baltimore-town would not govern the &s;tate.</P>
<P>On &s;uch an event, Baltimore-town would gain a part of the pre&s;ent citizens of Annapolis, &s;ome employed by govern|ment, and others compelled to repair thither, for the purpo&s;e of carrying on their trades and profe&s;&s;ions. It would like|wi&s;e attract a greater number than Annapolis does, of tho&s;e men, who&s;e principal u&s;e and employment is that of &s;pending money. A&s;&s;embly-men, jurors, witne&s;&s;es, &s;uitors, and others attending the public bodies, and offices, would then lay out in Baltimore-town, the money which at pre&s;ent they &s;pend at Annapolis, and perhaps &s;omething more. Of con|&s;equence, the demand for goods would be increa&s;ed, and a greater quantity of country produce would there find a market. Thus it is that commerce would be promoted. That is, there would be more buying and &s;elling at a parti|cular &s;pot.</P>
<P>No man of candour and reflection can in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, from Ari&s;tides' fir&s;t addre&s;s, that he is an enemy of Baltimore-town. With plea&s;ure he has contemplated its rapid growth, and &s;incerely he wi&s;hes it to increa&s;e &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with its own, and the welfare of the &s;tate. But it will ac|quire
<PB N="34" REF="019698_0033_0FADA3671F5BA620">no real &s;ub&s;tantial advantage, if it retains not the &s;pirit, the virtues, and the manners, which fir&s;t enabled it to ri&s;e. If Ari&s;tides re&s;ided in a di&s;tant corner of the &s;tate, if he had never &s;een "the beloved city," and if the good of Baltimore-town were his governing principle, he would oppo&s;e the mea&s;ure on which the minds of its inhabitants appear &s;o violently bent. When a large, wealthy, and populous town, which hath ri&s;en &s;olely by the enterprize, indu&s;try, and fru|gality of its inhabitants, becomes the capital of a free go|vernment, immediately the idle and luxurious, tho&s;e ver&s;ed in the arts of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, the various mini&s;ters of vice, are drawn thither, as if it were by in&s;tinct. Is it po&s;&s;ible that a great change of manners will not be the re|&s;ult? All this di&s;courages from &s;ettling there the men who might be of real utility to the place; &s;uch men choo&s;ing ra|ther a place which is yet in its infancy, and of the pro&s;perity of which, together with their own, they may lay the foun|dation. Let not a plain &s;ober inhabitant of Baltimore-town, after the government &s;hall have been removed, expect to live in the &s;tyle to which he has ever before been accu&s;tomed. Although he may be able to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from contagion, it is extremely probable that his family will not view things in the &s;ame light with him&s;elf; and yet, without their con|currence, his rational plan cannot be ob&s;erved. Can he bear the idea of acting like a tyrant, and doing a perpetual violence to their <HI>innocent</HI> inclinations? Can he even him&s;elf endure to be &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, and to live in a &s;tyle inferior to that of his neighbours, with whom he has hitherto lived on &s;trict terms of intimacy and equality? Can he bear that his former habits and manners &s;hall be de&s;pi&s;ed? The&s;e things mu&s;t undoubtedly occa&s;ion him great vexation. Suppo&s;e him then to glide ea&s;ily down with the torrent. Suppo&s;e that before the removal, his annual income was &pound;.500; that by this event it is increa&s;ed to &pound;.600, and that in con&s;equence of the event, his income will &s;carcely defray his current ex|pences. I &s;uppo&s;e nothing but what is extremely likely to happen. Is it not probable then, that the inhabitants of Baltimore-town in general, with re&s;pect to mere profit, will be in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than they were before? But the men of real &s;en&s;e and virtue, when they &s;hall ob&s;erve the general perver&s;ion of morals, vice triumphant, and every thing public and private expo&s;ed to &s;ale, will regret the event, as one of
<PB N="35" REF="019698_0034_0FADA367B35FDB00">the mo&s;t fatal that could have happened to them&s;elves, their families, and their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tides received his education in the capital of a neigh|bouring &s;tate. As at that time it was the metropolis of a province dependent on Great-Britain, as the government of it was in the hands of men belonging to a &s;ect of religious enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who did every po&s;&s;ible thing for the di&s;courage|ment of vice, it was exempt from almo&s;t all the u&s;ual vices of capital towns. But mark the change. Upon the break|ing out of the war, it became the &s;eat of congre&s;s, the re&s;ort of gay military men, and of all idle and curious travellers from the neighbouring &s;tates, and from the old world. It became too the re&s;idence of foreign mini&s;ters. Ari&s;tides vi|&s;ited it ju&s;t before the departure of congre&s;s, and in&s;tantly perceived the alteration. He di&s;covered many outward &s;igns of increa&s;ed wealth. In every hou&s;e which he entered, he &s;aw co&s;tly &s;plendid furniture. A va&s;t number of magnifi|cent carriages rolled along the &s;treets; and the habits of the people corre&s;ponded with the affected gaiety of their faces. He was a&s;toni&s;hed at the manners of his former acquaint|ance. Many tales of dome&s;tic grief were related to him; and he was told of families, who, with incomes increa&s;ed, were ha&s;tening to their ruin. He was &s;o &s;truck with all he ob&s;erved and heard, that he was alarmed at the coming of congre&s;s to his native &s;tate, and to the &s;pot of his re&s;idence. Happily it remained but a &s;hort time, and the peculiar in|clemency of the &s;ea&s;on whil&s;t it &s;taid, prevented that con|cour&s;e, and that di&s;&s;ipation, which might have turned the heads, and perverted the hearts of his fellow-citizens. But it remained long enough to teach them, that the influx of wealth which congre&s;s occa&s;ioned, would not indemnify them for the increa&s;e of their general expences, and the fatal change of their manners. And yet the re&s;idence of congre&s;s would have occa&s;ioned wealth, in &s;ome degree, to flow from every quarter into the &s;tate. I wi&s;h to impre&s;s on your minds, that an addition of money does not always make one actually the richer. Perhaps it may be concluded, that from having in &s;ome manner or other imbibed a &s;et of old fa&s;hioned no|tions, I am, at all events, again&s;t enriching the &s;tate. I do not in&s;i&s;t, that this &s;tate would not, by becoming the per|manent re&s;idence of congre&s;s, have derived more real good than evil. I leave it as a doubtful point, not nece&s;&s;ary at
<PB N="36" REF="019698_0035_0FADA368970FCF00">this time to be &s;ettled. I have endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that the removal of the government, although it might carry money with it, would not be really beneficial even to Balti|mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-town. And it is my purpo&s;e to &s;hew pre&s;ently, that it would not, in any &s;en&s;e, add to the riches of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Athough Ari&s;tides flatters him&s;elf that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the true &s;pirit of a republican, he does not con&s;ider modern re|publics on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e of antient Greece. In the&s;e days, the &s;trength and &s;ecurity of every government mu&s;t depend in a great mea&s;ure on the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of its trade. In war particularly, the riche&s;t &s;tates, or tho&s;e rather who&s;e governments can command the large&s;t &s;ums, will in general have the advantage. But let us not, becau&s;e we may have occa&s;ionally &s;kimmed a few pages of hi&s;tory, be &s;o fond of quoting parallels and examples. Let us fir&s;t learn a little to di&s;tingui&s;h. Is the &s;tate of Maryland, which is no more than one member of thirteen which compo&s;e the great republic of North-America, is this petty dependent &s;tate to be viewed in the &s;ame light with a great independent &s;eparate &s;tate, &s;urrounded by the powerful empires and king|doms of Europe? With re&s;pect to the&s;e, the Farmer's la&s;t addre&s;s contains many judicious, pertinent ob&s;ervations, the application of which is left to the reader. I am enabled to conjecture the meaning by what I have frequently heard of the politics of "the beloved town." It is there, as I have been told, pretty generally maintained, that we ought to have but one port; or if even the law &s;hould not directly confine importation and exportation to a &s;ingle port, that it ought, neverthele&s;s, to be brought about by political regula|tions, or in other words, by indirect means. If this be found doctrine, and if it be con&s;onant to your wi&s;hes, that no foreign goods &s;hould be imported unle&s;s into Baltimore-town, and that Baltimore-town &s;hould be the &s;ole mart for your produce, and if this would promote the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate in an eminent degree, then ought not the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure to be longer delayed than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It will be difficult, I conceive, to per&s;uade you, that we may not have &s;everal commercial towns. I mean, towns where your produce may be purcha&s;ed for exportation, and to which goods may be imported immediately from abroad.

To prove that the &s;uperiority of price was not owing to the &s;ize of Philadelphia, or to the commerce of Penn&s;ylvania being con|fined to that place, it mu&s;t be remarked, that wheat was ever as high at Brandywine, as at Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE>. George-town, I have the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, will become a place of con&s;iderable trade. The act re|&s;pecting the clearing of the Patowmack, excited jealous ap|prehen&s;ions in Baltimore-town, and a remembrance of that ought to excite &s;imilar apprehen&s;ions in you. Havre-de-Grace, from the advantages of its &s;ituation, is, by many per|&s;ons, expected to &s;hoot up with a rapidity, equal to the late growth of Baltimore-town. But the narrow &s;elfi&s;h policy of this, like that of every other great town, &s;uppo&s;es the pro&s;|perity of other places incompatible with its own, and would gladly cru&s;h them, either in infancy, or old age. Nothing but the want of a few enterpri&s;ing men, and a little good policy in the legi&s;lature, and di&s;cernment in the people, can prevent a town of con&s;iderable importance from erecting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;elf on the ea&s;tern &s;hore. But, if the &s;eat of government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> removed to Baltimore-town, the merchants of that place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;pect, will prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el from loading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unloading at any other place within the &s;tate, unle&s;s un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er their direction.

<P>Without the lea&s;t pretence to in&s;piration, I &s;hall, in my turn, deliver a prediction. When the &s;eat of government &s;hall be removed to Baltimore-town, there will &s;oon be an end to all fairne&s;s and freedom of legi&s;lative debate. It is a &s;ad truth, that in our days, whatever &s;pecious pretences may be made to public &s;pirit, private intere&s;t is almo&s;t the univer&s;al principle. With my whole heart I &s;ub&s;cribe to the Farmer's culogium on his beloved merchants. It is for merchants in general, that of all orders of men, I entertain the highe&s;t opinion. But the&s;e particular merchants mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I think, that like other merchants, and other men, they will exert them&s;elves to bring about tho&s;e mea&s;ures which will tend mo&s;t to the advancement of their own &s;uppo&s;ed welfare, and the aggrandi&s;ement of their town. I deem not &s;o meanly of country members, as to &s;uppo&s;e them capable of being bribed by elegant fare, old Madeira, or even a good round &s;um of money. But I know full well the efficacy of polite atten|tions,
<PB N="39" REF="019698_0038_0FADA36AC6B72D60">and infinuating addre&s;s, more e&s;pecially when infidious motives are not even &s;u&s;pected.

And I think it not improbable, unle&s;s its good habits be per&s;erved, that the commerce of Baltimore-town has already been at its b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.</P>
<P>However be that as it may, I conceive it the true policy of the &s;tate, taking not only the pre&s;ent, but future times into con&s;ideration, to lend an aiding hand to every ri&s;ing town. It ought, in a particular manner, to cheri&s;h all &s;uch as have any natural advantages. It &s;eems ordained by providence that we &s;hould have &s;everal trading towns; and it would be an in&s;ult to that providence, to contemn the ble&s;&s;ings, which it has dealt forth with a liberal hand. In our &s;ituation, the policy of a plurality of trading towns is beneficial, on a variety of accounts. It is by the&s;e, if by any thing, that Maryland as a &s;eparate independent nation, would be able to pre&s;erve its equilibrium with the neighbouring govern|ments. Suppo&s;e we have three towns, con&s;i&s;ting each of 15,000 inhabitants, the&s;e, on one account at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be more advantageous than one town of 45,000, as three towns would rai&s;e the value of lands in three neighbourhoods. But luxury, that bane of all genuine republics, that in&s;idious deadly &s;oe to freedom, could never attain &s;o great a height in any of the three, as it would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly do in the one. Be&s;ides, many of you would have a choice of markets. And, if a rival hip could take place among&s;t them, it would operate to thy advantage of all, by &s;timulating the indu&s;try and enter|prize of the merchants and mechanics, and by affording
<PB N="45" REF="019698_0044_0FADA373B08DD328">excitements to the farmers and planters. It would be thus that commerce would indeed be promoted, and the value of your lands indeed improved. It is not by paving the way for the principal inhabitants of a &s;ingle town to acquire immen&s;e e&s;tates, and by the&s;e e&s;tates, together with the in|fluence they &s;hall acquire in the legi&s;lature, to lord it over the land, that we &s;hall be&s;t provide for our own happine&s;s, and that of our late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>That the merchants of this &s;ingle town are de&s;irous of engro&s;&s;ing the whole commerce of the &s;tate, is, I think, but too evident. The main public rea&s;on which they a&s;&s;ign for giving them the &s;eat of government, is the nece&s;&s;ity of improv|ing commerce, and of concentrating our powers of exertion. Now this argument &s;urely applies to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all other trading towns; and if they can by any means bring about the projected removal, I think you mu&s;t perceive the great advantage they will have for compa&s;&s;ing any other mea&s;ure which they may &s;et their hearts upon. When I am calculating their weight and influence in the legi&s;lature, con|vened among&s;t them, I &s;hould never think of &s;tating proporti|ons as the Farmer would have me. And he mu&s;t think very meanly of his countrymen if he imagines they cannot detect the fallacy of his rule! Does any man &s;uppo&s;e, that "as two are to thirty-&s;ix," &s;o will the intere&s;t of Baltimore-town be to the landed intere&s;t? If indeed the que&s;tion could be plainly put, <Q>&s;hall the intere&s;t of Baltimore-town, or the landed intere&s;t be preferred?</Q> I make no doubt, it would be determined by a va&s;t majority in favour of the latter! Baltimore-town will take care never to contend openly again&s;t the landed intere&s;t, and it will take care al&s;o to gain over or to deceive, tho&s;e who ought to e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of the land-holders.</P>
<P>He has not a&s;&s;igned the true cau&s;es of the flouri&s;hing con|dition of Penn&s;ylvania. That condition is not owing to the government having confined commerce to a &s;ingle &s;pot. Nature had provided for that, by affording only a &s;ingle na|vigable river. Penn&s;ylvania owes its pro&s;perity to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of perfect religious freedom, to the other wi&s;e re|gulations of its illu&s;trious founder, to the di&s;couragements which have been con&s;tantly given to &s;lavery, and to the wi&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="019698_0045_0FADA37472041F78">policy and admirable manners of the quakers, under the for|mer government. But that the condition of our country people is far preferable to the condition of the country people of Penn&s;ylvania, is evident to him who has travelled through or &s;ojourned in each &s;tate, and who is not blinded by preju|dice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The rea&s;on is plain. The whole country of Penn&s;ylvania is, at this time, under a kind of va&s;&s;alage to the metropolis. Every thing depends upon their great town, and it is well known, and greatly lamented, that Philadelphia governs the whole &s;tate. It is true, as I have before &s;aid, that Penn&s;ylvania is more powerful than Mary|land. Its territory is va&s;tly more exten&s;ive; and, on ac|count of the &s;ize and bu&s;tle of its capical, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bank paper, it has at this moment the appearance of enjoying a greater de|gree of pro&s;perity than Maryland. Suppo&s;ing even, that this appearance is not deceitful, for Maryland to confine its com|merce to a &s;ingle town, becau&s;e nature has done it in a neigh|bouring &s;tate, would be running blindfold into a renuncia|tion of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for which we are the envy of the in|telligent per&s;ons in every part of that very &s;tate, except the capital.</P>
<P>If a town can be erected &s;omewhere in Talbot county, and the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern &s;hore can there find a ready market, it will &s;urely be more advantageous for them to carry thither their commodities, and with them procure the mer|chandi&s;e they want, than to be obliged to go a long tedious voyage to the town of Baltimore. Perhaps indeed, the ea&s;tern &s;hore might, by means of &s;ome beneficial regulations, have two or three con&s;iderable trading towns. George-town is nearer than Baltimore is to &s;ome parts of the upper counties; of cour&s;e, it is more convenient to the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts by land. But, if the ob&s;tructions in the Patowmack can be removed &s;o as to afford a water carriage, it would be wicked in the extreme to labour for the de&s;truction of George-town. If the trade down the Su&s;quehanna &s;hall become con|&s;iderable, and a market may be had at Havre-de-Grace, &s;ure|ly you would not compel the people to convey their com|modities, by a dangerous navigation, to Baltimore-town.</P>
<P>There are great advantages to a &s;tate in having con&s;idera|ble trading towns. Its own citizens may, at one of the&s;e towns, di&s;po&s;e immediately of the produce they &s;hall carry to market; and a merchant may there, if he plea&s;es, immedi|ately
<PB N="47" REF="019698_0046_0FADA375A2297008">di&s;po&s;e of a whole cargo at whole&s;ale, load his ve&s;&s;el with di&s;patch, and in a little time &s;end her back to &s;ea. As in the&s;e towns there is generally a competition among&s;t pur|cha&s;ers, the prices of your commodities cannot fail to be as high as can po&s;&s;ibly be afforded by the merchant who ex|ports them; and as too there is a competition among&s;t the &s;ellers of imported merchandi&s;e, you cannot fail to procure it as cheap as it can be &s;old without ruin to the &s;hopkeepers. For one trading town, Baltimore is already &s;ufficiently large; and the growth and commerce of that place has been of great &s;ervice to the &s;tate; but it is not yet large enough to prevent its merchants from taking advantage of you by art|ful combinations, provided we have but one trading town. The true policy of our government, would prompt it to con|fine commerce to ju&s;t as many &s;pots as the real convenience of all its citizens would require. There is indeed a great &s;eeming advantage for every man to have a port almo&s;t at his own door, as the carriage to market is thereby &s;aved; but then the price is much le&s;s, and the &s;ale more uncertain, than if he were obliged to carry his commodities &s;ome little di&s;tance from home. A judicious port law is the only thing wanting to render this &s;tate, in a little time, the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing and pro&s;perous &s;tate, in proportion to its &s;ize, in the union. But having a port at every man's door is one extreme, and having only one port is another. A wi&s;e politician might &s;oon di&s;cover the proper medium. Were three or four ports e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on this and as many on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and were all merchant ve&s;&s;els prohibited from leading or unloading any where el&s;e, we &s;hould therein &s;oon &s;ind our account, every one, or a competent number of the&s;e places, would, in a little time, afford the advantages I have mentioned; you would enjoy the benefit of a competition between the&s;e places, and there would be no danger of your &s;uffering from com|binations and monopolies.</P>
<P>Again&s;t a &s;cheme like this, I fear the prejudices of my countrymen, and the mi&s;taken notions of private intere&s;t, will rai&s;e in&s;uperable bars; but I flatter my&s;elf, that the&s;e prejudices will neverthele&s;s produce &s;ome good.

They expect, I pre&s;ume, by the legi&s;lature "taking them under its immediate protection," to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ure, <HI>in a fair way,</HI> acts of &s;uch a nature, that almo&s;t all, if not the whole, produce of the &s;tate, &s;hall be finally collected at Baltimore, or at lea&s;t pa&s;s through the hands of its merchants; that all imported goods &s;hall be unloaded at that town; and that the ve&s;&s;els which bring them &s;hall there take in their loads, except perhaps a few tobacco &s;hips, which &s;hall, neverthele&s;s, be under their direction. Petty towns there may be in the different parts of the &s;tate; but the&s;e mu&s;t contain no capital merchants. They &s;hall contain &s;hopkeepers, tributary to Baltimore; and the&s;e &s;hopkeepers &s;hall not pre&s;ume to load or unload a &s;ingle &s;hip: If all this can be effected by a re|moval of the government, the town of Baltimore will indeed be a mo&s;t important place. But can you, reflecting on all I have advanced, and u&s;ing too your own reflections and ob&s;ervations, can you, I &s;ay, perceive, that all this will tend to the general happine&s;s and pro&s;perity to the &s;tate? Can you &s;uppo&s;e it will rai&s;e the value of your lands at a di&s;tance from the capital? Can you &s;uppo&s;e it will rai&s;e the prices of your commodities beyond what they may attain without this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">azing agrandi&s;ement of Baltimore-town? Can you expect, by purcha&s;ing commodities from &s;hopkeepers, or by going your&s;elves to the <HI>fountain head,</HI> that you will procure them cheaper than you do at pre&s;ent under pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances? Can you &s;uppo&s;e that this will increa&s;e the &s;trength of Maryland more than by having a variety of trading towns, or that it will give a greater weight in the union?</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to demon&s;trate, (and I tru&s;t to your &s;atisfaction,) that if Baltimore does not become the favourite, or in other words, the director of the legi&s;lature, the com|merce of that town will not in the end be promoted by a re|moval of the government, notwith&s;tanding that at fir&s;t more goods will be there &s;old, more country produce there pur|cha&s;ed, its hou&s;es better filled, and more tenements erected. You mu&s;t, I think, be &s;atisfied, that your own welfare, and the &s;trength and dignity of the &s;tate, do not depend on the completion of the mea&s;ures again&s;t which I have warned you.
<PB N="49" REF="019698_0048_0FADA376AF514800">Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it either way, that Baltimore-town will, or will not, govern the &s;tate, and no public rea&s;on under Heaven ap|pears for pre&s;enting it with the &s;eat of government.</P>
<P>Her advocates may tell you that I have &s;landered her; that her inhabitants have no intention, by law, to engre&s;s commerce. But the con&s;equences of a remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l do not at all depend upon the pre&s;ent views, wi&s;hes or intentions, of the pre&s;ent inhabitants. The&s;e may alter with a change of circum|&s;tances, and even the &s;et of inhabitants, either with or with|out a removal of the government, will be materially changed in the cour&s;e of a very few years. But in the name of com|mon &s;en&s;e, what is it they do mean? If at any time they can hit upon a &s;cheme for the advancement of the public good, or if they want any local regulations that are ju&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent with the public welfare, what is there to prevent them from laying their plans before the legi&s;lature at Anna|polis? The mi&s;chief is, that every thing mu&s;t there undergo a full and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The a&s;&s;embly has been ever prone to indulge them in every thing that has had the lea&s;t appear|ance of propriety; the a&s;&s;embly to have done otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been wicked and blind; and every one readily allows, that they are, on all accounts, entitled to the greate&s;t at|tention and re&s;pect. If, notwith&s;tanding this, they cannot be contented until they get under the immediate protection of the legi&s;lature, and yet do not mean to govern the &s;tate, I can a&s;&s;ign to them no other motives but the&s;e. They mu&s;t have in contemplation &s;ome matter of mere private intere&s;t, and hence they become advocates for their town. Or they mu&s;t conceive, that by merely enjoying the &s;eat of government, without having any influence in the legi&s;lature, their town will be benefited; and they may think too, that the com|merce of the &s;tate will be improved. In both the&s;e I have endeavoured to demon&s;trate they would be deceived. Or their mere pride cannot &s;upport the idea of a town, &s;o far inferior to theirs, being the metropolis, bearing all the honours of government, and compelling them at times to at|tend public bodies. But in this matter you are all concern|ed. And you ought &s;urely to keep the &s;eat of government where you may be certain that your repre&s;entatives cannot be expo&s;ed to the arts of cunning, intriguing, intere&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed men; where you may be certain that the legi&s;lature may
<PB N="50" REF="019698_0049_0FADA377799DD8F0">quietly and freely debate; where a mob cannot be rai&s;ed to di&s;turb or intimidate them; where the good of the whole will probably be equally con&s;ulted; where the influence of a part may not prevail again&s;t the re&s;t; where powerful com|binations may not be entered into again&s;t your freedom and rights; where the &s;enate may retain its con&s;titutional impor|tance; where the genuine &s;ub&s;tance, and not the mere form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only, of your con&s;titution may be pre&s;erved. Let me en|treat you again and again, to reflect even on this point, whether you ought to con&s;ign to de&s;truction a great number of your innocent fellow-citizens, and at the &s;ame time ha|zard the lo&s;s of many great and &s;ure advantages, without the certain pro&s;pect of &s;ome mighty good, that may amply com|pen&s;ate for every thing we can po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e.</P>
<P>By fixing the &s;eat of government at a large commercial town, you put your liberties to the hazard, as much as a &s;ingle &s;tate in the union of thirteen free &s;tates can po&s;&s;ibly do. True policy does not require us to confine commerce to a &s;ingle &s;pot; and you are greatly intere&s;ted in the growth of other towns. The value of your lands will not increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion as the &s;ize and trade of a &s;ingle town. The value of all your lands may be augmented by the growth of a number of other towns. The liberal in&s;truction of the ri&s;ing generation will be be&s;t carried on at a &s;mall capital, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the refinement of its manners, purity of morals, and univer&s;al good order; and the liberties of your po&s;terity depend on maintaining a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hone&s;t and able men. There is no u&s;e whatever to a &s;tate like ours, in concentrating our riches and &s;trength; but by &s;o doing you may run the ri&s;k of combinations again&s;t your liberties. In all great towns there is a fatal tendency to luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, and of cour&s;e to a degeneracy of manners; but the&s;e evils will be much greater in a large town, when it becomes the capital of a &s;tate. The native &s;oil of every &s;pecies of corruption is an exten&s;ive metropolis. The &s;eat of go|vernment, merely as &s;uch, is not favourable to the commerce of a town; but as it cannot fail to give any large town an undue influence in all public councils, the fixing of the &s;eat of government at Baltimore, and the adoption of the politics of that town, will probably do an irreperable injury to the community at large. And all the&s;e are but a part of the ar|guments
<PB N="51" REF="019698_0050_0FADA37866B89518">which will naturally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to every man of plain common &s;en&s;e, who will apply him&s;elf to a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate deliberation on this grand and intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Farmer does not he&s;itate to a&s;&s;ert, that no evils have re&s;ulted to New-York, or Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, from holding the &s;eats of their governments in their great commercial towns; and that from tho&s;e towns they have derived great federal importance. That they have actually experienced the evil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t which I am guarding you, I am too little acquainted with their proceedings <HI>po&s;itively</HI> to a&s;&s;ert
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>I think proper here to in&s;ert a paragraph from a paper called the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Spy, publi&s;hed weekly at Worce&s;ter. The date is the</HI> 16th <HI>of March</HI> 1786. <HI>It was handed to me after I had fini&s;hed this addre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>On Monday la&s;t week, a motion was made in the honour|able hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, to remove the general court out of Bo&s;ton. The motion was &s;econded, and Thur&s;day la&s;t was a&s;&s;igned for the con&s;ideration of this important matter. It has long been complained of, that large and populous &s;ca|ports are improper places for the deliberations of a legi&s;lature. Be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ary noi&s;e and hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s in a large commercial town, many members of the legi&s;lature are thought to be under an undue influence. Congre&s;s viewed matters in this light, and to prevent the evils re&s;ulting therefrom, wi&s;e|ly came to the determination of building a federal city.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>From this it would appear, that the evils have already been felt. What will be the re&s;ult of the debate will in a little time appear.

That in a little time they mu&s;t feel them, I am as well convinced as I can po&s;&s;ibly be of any event which is yet in the womb of time. Of Philadelphia I know a little more; and might &s;afely refer you to a hi&s;tory of that &s;tate for an illu&s;tration of almo&s;t every part of my argument. That &s;tate, indeed, to the re|gret of almo&s;t all its worthy citizens, has only one branch of the legi&s;lature. But &s;ay, whether you conceive it po&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t the di&s;tractions of that government, which have pro|ceeded
<PB N="52" REF="019698_0051_0FADA378F9298798">from the violence of party &s;pirit in their great com|mercial capital, that a &s;enate could have even &s;ub&s;i&s;ted until the arrival of their fir&s;t great con&s;titutional period for elect|ing a council of cen&s;ors.</P>
<P>Some of the inhabitants of Baltimore-town have &s;et up a kind of claim to the &s;eat of government, and they found it on the amount of their public taxes.</P>
<P>If a thing, merely in the gift of government, were con|tended for between the town of Baltimore and the city of Annapolis, the legi&s;lature might determine on the &s;ame prin|ciple which actuated the judges in the famous conte&s;t for the armour of Achilles; or they might perhaps decide with pro|priety in favour of the town, on account of its great &s;uperi|ority of numbers. But if a deci&s;ion in its favour would in|jure the community, this &s;ingle town would be bound to give up to the &s;tate, on the &s;ame principle that Annapolis would be bound to yield to it. The payment of taxes, how|ever, confers no other right, either on an individual or a town, than a right to the equal protection of government; which, as it is milituted for the benefit of all the per&s;ons compo&s;ing &s;ociety, &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be admini&s;tered &s;o as to injure none, and to con&s;ult the welfare of all.</P>
<P>That Annapolis has &s;o long been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;eat of government, the Farmer con&s;iders as an argument for the removal. He call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the principle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tation. He &s;hould con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, on that principle, that other towns may hereafter put in a claim. However, as on this head he has indulged him&s;elf with &s;ome joco&s;e expre&s;&s;ions&punc; I can &s;carcely con&s;ider him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the argument, and therefore I do not think It worth while to expo&s;e the folly of the principle, when ap|plied to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of government.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is, in it&s;elf a &s;trong argument again&s;t di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. There is re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding in Annapolis &s;carcely one free men, woman, or child, that would not &s;uffer by a removal of the government.

At any rate, a very con&s;iderable ma|jority
<PB N="53" REF="019698_0052_0FADA379D25AA778">of them cannot be greatly intere&s;ted in &s;upport of the mea&s;ure. At lea&s;t they have not, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, their livelihoods depending on the event. Say even that they would be con&s;iderably enriched, and that the community is in no way intere&s;ted. Would you, on account merely of doing good to your fellow-citizens, prefer the giving to a great number of men that, which they never have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that which, 'till very lately, they never looked for, and that, which is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s? Would you, I &s;ay, prefer doing this, to the letting a &s;mall number of men retain that which they ever have held, to which no others have a &s;uperior right, which cannot be divided, and which is almo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to their exi&s;tence? Whether it is better to let a &s;ingle man retain an e&s;tate, ju&s;t competent to his &s;upport, or to take it, and di&s;tribute it among&s;t half a dozen men, who before were as rich as him&s;elf? The que&s;tion will not admit a di&s;pute; and you mu&s;t at once perceive the va&s;t difference between with-holding from a man that which he never had, and the depriving him of what he has always had. Examine the &s;ubject in every point of view, the more you reflect, the better you will be convinced, that Baltimore-town ought not, in this in&s;tance, to be gratified. I will not go &s;o far as others have done. I will not &s;ay, the attempt for its wickedne&s;s, is without a pa|rallel. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that never yet have I heard of any thing more ungenerous. To view it in its naked de|formity is, indeed, almo&s;t &s;ufficient to impre&s;s one with horror!</P>
<P>The only arguments in favour of the propo&s;ition, which remain to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, are directed to your repre&s;entatives in their private capacities, and it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to take care that the&s;e arguments &s;hall not influence them to &s;acrifice your intere&s;t to what they may conceive to be their own private advantage.</P>
<P><Q>It is &s;aid that at Baltimore-town the members of the a&s;&s;embly may tran&s;act their private bu&s;ine&s;s, whil&s;t they are managing the affairs of government. This con&s;ideration is pre&s;&s;ed home to their feelings, as individuals. But &s;urely <HI>you</HI> cannot be benefited, by having <HI>their</HI> attention diverted from the public bu&s;ine&s;s. Would any pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent man em|ploy, for the management of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which requires the
<PB N="54" REF="019698_0053_0FADA37A6F8D0110">utmo&s;t diligence and attention, a per&s;on, who at the &s;ame time, is carrying on a bu&s;ine&s;s much more intere&s;ting to him than that of his employers? I acknowledge, that in general the private bu&s;ine&s;s of the members may &s;oon be di&s;patched. But their &s;taunch friends at election will expect their little affairs to be managed likewi&s;e. It is not im|probable, that your repre&s;entatives will even &s;olicit agen|cies and commi&s;&s;ions,</Q> and will e&s;teem their &s;eats of va|lue, on account of being maintained by the public, whil&s;t they &s;hall be devoting their talents and attention to private concerns. Does not every man know, that to execute pro|perly the duties of a legi&s;lator, the clo&s;e&s;t application, the mo&s;t inten&s;e &s;tudy, and an entire exemption from all other bu&s;ine&s;s, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary? We are told indeed, that few members are di&s;tingui&s;hed, even at Annapolis, by their application to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and that they con|&s;ume a great portion of their time in unprofitable amu&s;e|ments. This I &s;hall not di&s;pute; but let them, at any time, have private bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, and I am afraid, that in&s;tead of devoting to it their hours of amu&s;ement, they will rather employ tho&s;e hours which belong &s;trictly to the public. There is a danger too of having their minds occupied by this private bu&s;ine&s;s, even whil&s;t they &s;hall be within the public walls.</P>
<P>From a gentleman who has called the 9th article of the de|claration of rights <HI>only declaratory,</HI> I did not expect an argu|ment derived from that article. But it &s;eems, that whenever it &s;uits the purpo&s;e of Baltimore-town, this article may &s;erve as a guide to the legi&s;lature. The article &s;ays, that the place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature mu&s;t be mo&s;t convenient to the members. He has mi&s;taken the plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of the article. The place is not to be the mo&s;t convenient for them in their private characters, to conduct their private affairs. In the&s;e the public is not intere&s;ted; but on the contra|ry, it is intere&s;ted, as I have before &s;aid, in letting them have little opportunity of tran&s;acting their private affairs, whil&s;t they ought to be engaged in its &s;ervice. The article means a place the mo&s;t central, the mo&s;t convenient for them to repair to, and the be&s;t &s;uited to them in their public charac|ters, as members of the legi&s;lature. <Q>Let us then examine which place is better adapted to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;la|ture. In Baltimore-town the members may be occupied
<PB N="55" REF="019698_0054_0FADA37B678508F0">by private bu&s;ine&s;s. In Annapolis, it is pre&s;umable, they will have little bu&s;ine&s;s,</Q> except that upon which they &s;hall be &s;ent, the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ecuring the happine&s;s of their con&s;tituents. <Q>I will not &s;ay that Baltimore-town, with all its numerous buildings, cannot afford proper ac|commodations, becau&s;e I doubt not, in the beginning, that great efforts would be made to render the place agreeable. I maintain, that in Annapolis the members may always procure, at a rea&s;onable rate, even elegant fare, comfort|able lodgings, and quiet apartments, remote from all that noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s, which is altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with calm thought and &s;ober deliberation.</Q></P>
<P>That Annapolis is more central, and more convenient for a majority of the &s;tate to repair to, you mu&s;t all know. By your con&s;titution, the annual meeting of the legi&s;lature takes place in November, and it rarely ends before January. At that time, <HI>as I am informed,</HI> the town of Baltimore is ge|nerally inacce&s;&s;ible by water, and therefore the gentlemen of the ea&s;tern &s;hore, to return home, might be under the nece&s;|&s;ity of heading the bay, or coming down by land to Anna|polis. At what other &s;ea&s;on can they &s;o conveniently leave their homes as at the end of autumn? Say that you will change the con&s;titution, and let the annual meeting be in &s;ummer, (for it cannot be in the &s;pring,) the heat, the du&s;t, and the apprehen&s;ion, if not the real danger, of contagion, will &s;oon induce an opinion, that it were better to attend at the pre&s;ent &s;tated period at Annapolis.</P>
<P>There is a &s;et of men, the pretended friends to Annapolis, but in effect its mo&s;t dangerous foes. The&s;e men affect candour and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. They yield to the force of the rea&s;ons again&s;t the mea&s;ure, but then they argue in this way. <Q>The removal is an event which the ordinary cour&s;e of affairs mu&s;t inevitably bring about. The citizens of Annapolis can prevent it only a few &s;ea&s;ons longer; the delay will afford them very little benefit; and, until it takes place, they mu&s;t remain in an unea&s;y &s;tate of &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pen&s;e. It were better then for them to yield at once to inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, and to let Baltimore enjoy tho&s;e ad|vantages which mu&s;t attend the &s;eat of government.</Q></P>

<P>Would this harrangue induce a &s;ingle man to lay violent hands upon him&s;elf? Would it prevent him in his &s;ickne&s;s from u&s;ing the means of recovery? There is, however, a capital di&s;tinction between the two ca&s;es. Death we all know to be inevitable. The removal of the &s;eat of govern|ment I am &s;o far from thinking unavoidable, that I never yet could &s;ee the great cau&s;e which Annapolis had to fear. In a few years, I am per&s;uaded, the matter will be totally out of the que&s;tion; for in the&s;e few years you will be able to profit from the experience of your &s;i&s;ter &s;tates; and you will di&s;cern your true intere&s;ts too well to afford Baltimore-town the lea&s;t room for hope.</P>
<P>That the greate&s;t towns throughout the world are, for the mo&s;t part, capitals, I cannot deny; but this con&s;ideration affords no argument for Baltimore-town. Mo&s;t of the go|vernments in the world are arbitrary, and for the &s;ecurity of &s;uch, large capitals are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Whenever therefore, in one of the&s;e governments, whether it be a de&s;|poti&s;m, a monarchy, or an ari&s;tocracy, a town increa&s;es &s;o far as to overtop the capital, it is good policy for the &s;ove|reign power immediately to change the place of its re&s;idence There is perhaps no in&s;tance of a large metropolis in a go|vernment entirely free. There is, in every great town, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fatal a tendency to corruption, that a government there can hardly fail of becoming arbitrary. For us then to change our capital, becau&s;e in mo&s;t other governments their large&s;t towns are capitals, would be acting contrary to the dictates of common &s;en&s;e and experience. In a word, &s;o long as your liberties &s;hall be dear to your hearts, and &s;o long as ye &s;hall be able to under&s;tand your true intere&s;ts, you will per|mit the government to remain where there is nothing to en|danger them.</P>

<P>As the election of a &s;enate is at hand, attempts may like|wi&s;e be made to in&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct the electors. You &s;urely mu&s;t re|mark, how imprope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it would be to in&s;truct men who are to choo&s;e upon oath. It is the evident intention of the con&s;ti|tution, that the&s;e men &s;hall always be at perfect liberty to exerci&s;e their own judgments. If not, wherein is the u&s;e of that refined mode of election? It were much better for the people at once to elect the &s;enate, than to choo&s;e electors who are bound to obey their in&s;tructions. It would in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed be a pro&s;titution of language to call them electors, if in&s;tead of naming their own choice, they are only to utter the opi|nion of others.</P>
<P>Permit me now, my countrymen, to remark, that although I do not que&s;tion your right of dictating to your delegates, you ought to exerci&s;e that right in a very &s;paring manner. Perhaps in&s;tructions have never yet been fairly obtained. I will inform you what alone I conceive to be fair in&s;tructions, and &s;uch as your repre&s;entatives may be bound to obey. If at a public meeting, of which general notice has been given, any matter &s;hall be freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and in&s;tructions re&s;pect|ing it be produced, and read to the people there a&s;&s;ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bled, approved, and &s;igned by a majority of the voters in the coun|ty, and by their directions pre&s;ented to their delegates, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ought the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r delegates either to pur&s;ue tho&s;e in&s;tructions, or to re&s;ign their &s;eats.</P>
<P>But when bu&s;y artful men, who are not even re&s;idents of the county, &s;hall go about &s;oliciting the people, one after another, to &s;ub&s;cribe their in&s;tructions; and when the peo|ple have never heard a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject; and when even a majority has not &s;igned them; in&s;tructions like the&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="019698_0057_0FADA382EB909680">cannot, and ought not, on any principle whatever, to be binding. It is notorious, that in&s;tructions like the&s;e may be obtained for almo&s;t any purpo&s;e whatever. Sometimes indeed, your repre&s;entatives take a fancy that they are in&s;tructed, when they have not even a writing to &s;hew; when they have not conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject with a tenth part of their con&s;titu|ents; and when perhaps the &s;ubject has not in their county been even generally talked of. The truth is, the&s;e men have not a proper &s;en&s;e of their own dignity, and they &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be dictated to by a few bu&s;tling noi&s;y men, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they are apprehen&s;ive they cannot maintain their &s;eats.</P>
<P>It is rarely that the people of a county can have a fair comprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive view of a &s;ubject to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly. Indeed it is &s;eldom at a popular meeting that both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">des of a que&s;tion are permitted to be &s;tated and exammed. Be&s;ides, the repre&s;entatives of each county are, at the &s;ame time, repre&s;entatives of the &s;tate, and bound to con&s;ult the good of the whole. For all the&s;e weighty and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, I would advi&s;e you to give your in|&s;tructions in tho&s;e ca&s;es only where your rights and liberties may be endangered. In a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, when every e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ine will be put in motion to carry a mo&s;t pernicious mea|&s;ure, and when too there is a danger that your repre&s;enta|tives may be &s;wayed by per&s;onal motives; it is in ca&s;es like this, that you may, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple, interfere.</P>
<P>But I do not urge you, my countrymen, even on this oc|ca&s;ion, to bind your delegates by in&s;tructions. I have ever ob&s;erved, that the men fonde&s;t of procuring them, are tho&s;e who are fearful of being borne down by &s;uperior rea&s;on. You will be told, that the friends of Annapolis, at the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, would not con&s;ent to refer to the people the propo&s;i|tion for a removal. It is true that a motion was made for leave to bring in a bill for removing the &s;eat of government. This motion being both &s;econded and oppo&s;ed, a day was a&s;&s;igned for the debate. On that day, after a fair and di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and when every member was <HI>at perfect liberty</HI> to vote his opinion, the motion was rejected by 35 again&s;t 18. A &s;econd motion was then made, for leave to bring in the &s;ame bill, to be publi&s;hed under the direction of the hou&s;e for your con&s;ideration. This motion too was re|jected almo&s;t without a debate. It was the publication of
<PB N="59" REF="019698_0058_0FADA3843843DEA0">this bill, by order of the hou&s;e of delegates, that the Farmer thinks would have been "a rea&s;onable expedient for collect|ing your &s;en&s;e." It would have been indulging the friends of Baltimore-town in a manner, of which, in this &s;tate, there never was, and never ought to be, an example; and a &s;mall minority had not the lea&s;t colour of right to expect it. You mu&s;t indeed have de&s;pi&s;ed the conduct of your repre|&s;entatives, had they publi&s;hed for your con&s;ideration, a bill which, after deliberation, they would not &s;uffer to be brought into their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been generally believed, that a majority of the gen|tlemen compo&s;ing the pre&s;ent &s;enate, was oppo&s;ed to the mea&s;ure. Of cour&s;e, one great object may be (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) to pack a &s;enate; and for that purpo&s;e it will be expedient, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to pack their electors. You will remember, however, that the &s;enate to be cho&s;en in September next, is to la&s;t five years, and in that time an improper &s;enate might &s;ubvert the con&s;titution. The con|vention were &s;o fully impre&s;&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ith an idea of the nece&s;&s;ity of having the be&s;t characters for that elevated &s;tation, that they invented the mo&s;t admirable mode of election which has ever been known in the univer&s;e, and for any &s;ingle purpo&s;e to defeat their &s;alutary provi&s;ion, would be a di&s;grace to the people of Maryland. I wi&s;h not to be under&s;tood, that any per&s;on who &s;hall vote for a removal of the government would be unworthy of a &s;eat in the &s;enate. I have no &s;uch con|tracted narrow way of thinking. My po&s;ition is, that &s;uch men only ought to be elected, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t culti|vated minds, the mo&s;t independent &s;pirits, the greate&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> love of country, the mo&s;t inflexible integrity, and the greate&s;t dignity of character. As few men, indeed, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the&s;e requi&s;ites of a perfect &s;enator, the electors &s;hould di&s;card no man of who&s;e worth we have had ample experience. I would di&s;mi&s;s no man merely becau&s;e he is an advocate for the re|moval, and I would not elect even a plain, hone&s;t, ignorant man, merely becau&s;e he is a &s;taunch friend to Annapolis. Let the electors examine the merits of our pre&s;ent &s;enators, without any regard to their &s;entiments on any one particular que&s;tion. Let the opinion of the electors on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion be what it may, they cannot &s;uppo&s;e every thing de|pends on carrying the mea&s;ure. I conceive, that if an cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">or
<PB N="60" REF="019698_0059_0FADA385032148E8">wi&s;hes to fix the government at Baltimore, he ought to re|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble his care in electing a good &s;enate, becau&s;e the quali|fications of a &s;enator, who will on all occa&s;ions perform his duty in that town, mu&s;t be rare indeed.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, my beloved countrymen, to be exceed|ingly circum&s;pect in your choice of electors, and attempt not to lay them under any injunction whatever, except that of examining the conduct of each memner of the pre&s;ent &s;enate, and of making very particular inquiries concerning all tho&s;e who &s;hall be prepo&s;ed as objects of their choice, As to the general proceedings of the &s;enate, from the commencement of the government, the whole &s;tate bears ample te&s;timony of their worth; and I know not the man in the pre&s;ent body, who&s;e conduct, on the whole, has not merited your appro|bation. However, it is the duty of your electors to make the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny, and let them not think of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing any gentleman, until they &s;hall be certain of finding a more wor|thy &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>It may be expected, that Ari&s;tides will not conclude, with|out making &s;ome per&s;onal retort upon his adver&s;aries; but he will not imitate them in a practice which he contemns. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns not the lea&s;t re&s;entment, and the only revenge which he wi&s;hes to take, is to &s;ubdue them by &s;u|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r rea&s;on. As indeed he was con&s;cious, that neither his moral or political character was in any part vulnerable, he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from per&s;onal reflections; but it &s;eems that his indigence is a matter of reproach. If the narrow|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of his fortune were imputable to folly or vice, the re|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">of, although imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terial to the que&s;tion, might indeed have been ju&s;t. But when under a nece&s;&s;itous dependence on a government, which has repeatedly, and perhaps from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it &s;aith, he has maintained a character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by meanne&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;honour; when he has even been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by the manly independence of his &s;pirit; the re|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch, if it recoils not on his adver&s;ary, was at lea&s;t truly prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>It is not Ari&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> alone, that the advocates of Baltimore have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in your edimation.

<PB N="61" REF="019698_0060_0FADA385B340BE28">would they revive the prejudices formerly entertained on ac|count of the overweening arrogance of a few powerful men. They tell you, &s;he receives more from the public than &s;he contributes. In what manner can they &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion? Will they charge it with the &s;alaries paid to a few civil offi|cers? Or, if the&s;e &s;alaries be properly chargeable to the city, will they pretend that they are more than an adequate com|pen&s;ation for &s;ervices? They remark that Annapolis has no place of Divine wor&s;hip. Would they infer that &s;he has no religion? Or will they contend that any other place excels her in virtue and morality? Are they ignorant, that the old church was taken down ju&s;t before the war, for the purpo&s;e of crecting a new one on the &s;pot? And that ever &s;ince, the members of the church of England, who con&s;titute almo&s;t the whole of the citizens, have con&s;tantly had Divine wor|&s;hip, and have hand&s;omely &s;upported their mini&s;ter? Many untoward circum&s;tances have concurred in hitherto prevent|ing the new building; but be it known to her enemies, as well as to her friends, that Annapolis is about to wipe away the di&s;grace, and to erect a place of wor&s;hip on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|ble and elegant plan.</P>
<P>I doubt not, that to many of you I have appeared exceed|ingly proli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
