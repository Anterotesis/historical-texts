<P>THE late Lord Che&s;terfield having been uni|ver&s;ally allowed, to be one of the be&s;t bred men of the age, and mo&s;t intimately acquainted with the principles and manners of mankind, the Editor of the following pages humbly apprebends, he could not do the ri&s;ing generation a greater &s;ervice, than by collecting tho&s;e valuable pre|cepts that are contained in his celebrated letters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;on dige&s;ting them under di&s;tinct heads, and thereby forming a &s;y&s;tem of the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>To that end, he has diligently &s;elected every ob&s;ervation and remark, that can po&s;&s;ibly im|prove or inform the mind, within the rules of morality; and where there &s;eemed a deficiency in any part of the &s;y&s;tem, from the occa&s;ional <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in Lord Che&s;ter field's corre&s;pondence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has en|deavoured to &s;upply it.

<HEAD>PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS, &amp;c. ADDRESSED TO EVERY YOUNG GFNTLEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>AS all young men, on their fir&s;t out&s;et in life are in want of &s;ome experience and friendly hand to bring them forwards and reach them a knowledge of the world; I think I cannot do the ri&s;ing generation a greater &s;ervice, than by directing the young ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">'s &s;teps, and teaching him how to make his way among the crowd.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY is a polite accom|pli&s;hment, and generally an attendant upon merit: It is engag|ing to the highe&s;t degree, and wins the heart of all our acquaintance. On the contrary none are more di&s;gu&s;t|ful in company than the impudent and pre&s;uming.</P>
<P>The man who is, on all occa&s;ions, commending and &s;peaking well of him&s;elf, we naturally di&s;like. On the other hand, he who &s;tudies to conceal his own de&s;erts, who does ju&s;tice to the merit of others, who talks but
<PB N="7" REF="019258_0004_0FAA6A168C56BCB8">little of him&s;elf, and that with mo|de&s;ty, makes a favourable impre&s;&s;ion on the per&s;ons he is conver&s;ing with, captivates their minds, and gains their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, however, widely differs from an aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be applauded. To appear &s;imple is as ill-bred as to be impu|dent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and adre&s;s the company without the lea&s;t embara&s;&s;|ment. To be out of countenance when &s;poken to, and not to have an an&s;wer ready is ridiculous to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>An aukward country fellow, when he comes into company better than him&s;elf, is exceedingly di&s;concerted. He knows not what to do with his hands, or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his &s;ide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with
<PB N="8" REF="019258_0005_0FAA6A17677F09C8">the button. If &s;poken to, he is in a much wor&s;e &s;ituation, he an&s;wers with the utmo&s;t difficulty and nearly &s;tam|mers: whereas a gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulne&s;s and a mode&s;t a&s;&s;ur|ance, addre&s;&s;es even per&s;ons he does not know, in an ea&s;y and natural manner, and without the lea&s;t em|barra&s;&s;ment. This is the characteri&s;|tic of good breeding, a very nece&s;&s;a|ry knowledge in our intercour&s;e with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is fre|quently better received than a man of &s;en&s;e with the addre&s;s and manners of a clown.</P>
<P>Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be a&s;hamed of; &s;teer clear of the&s;e, and you may go into any company you will; not that I would have a young man throw of all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending, or being di&s;e&s;teemed, will make him pre&s;erve a proper de|corum.
<PB N="9" REF="019258_0005_0FAA6A17677F09C8">Some per&s;ons, from ex|periencing the inconveniencies of fal&s;e mode&s;ty, have run into the other extreme, and acquired the character of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps him&s;elf within the two, and &s;teers the middle way. He is ea&s;y and firm in every company, is mode&s;t, but not ba&s;hful, &s;teady but not im|pudent. He copies the manners of the better people, and conforms to their cu&s;toms with ea&s;e and attention.</P>
<P>Till we can pre&s;ent our&s;elves in all companies with coolne&s;s and uncon|cern, we can never pre&s;ent our&s;elves well; nor will a man ever be &s;uppo&s;|ed to have kept good company, or ever be acceptable in &s;uch com|pany, if he cannot appear there ea&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embarra&s;&s;ed. A mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n every part of life, is the mo&s;t ad|vantageous qualification we can po&s;|sibly acquire.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of becoming in&s;olent, a
<PB N="10" REF="019258_0006_0FAA6A18B035ACC0">man of &s;en&s;e under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merit, is more mode&s;t. He behave him&s;elf with firmne&s;s, but without the lea&s;t pre&s;umption. The man who is ignorant of his own merit is no le&s;s a fool than he who is con&s;tantly di&s;|playing it. A man of under&s;tanding avails him&s;elf of his abilities, but ne|ver boa&s;ts of them; whereas the ti|mid and ba&s;hful can never pu&s;h him|&s;elf in life, but will be always kept behind by the forward and bu&s;tling.

<HEAD>LYING.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the vices, there is no one more criminal, more mean, and more ridiculous, than lying. The end we de&s;ign by it is very &s;eldom accom|pli&s;hed, for lies are always found out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t one time or other; and yet there are
<PB N="14" REF="019258_0008_0FAA6A1A3370CAF0">per&s;ons who give way to this vice, who are otherwi&s;e of good principles, and have not been ill educated.</P>
<P>Lies generally proceed from vanity, cowardice, and a revengeful di&s;po&s;iti|on, and &s;ometimes from a mi&s;taken notion of &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>He who tells a malicious lie, with a view of injuring the per&s;on he &s;peaks of, may gratify his wi&s;h for a while, but will, in the end, find it recoil upon him&s;elf; for, as &s;oon as he is detected, (and detected he mo&s;t cer|tainly will be) he is de&s;pi&s;ed for the infamous attempt, and whatever he may &s;ay hereafter of that per&s;on, will be con&s;idered as fal&s;e, whether it be &s;o or not.</P>
<P>If a man lies, &s;huffles or equivo|cates, for, in fact, they are all alike, by way of excu&s;e for any thing he has &s;aid or done, he aggravates the of|fence rather than le&s;&s;ens it; for the per&s;on to whom the lie is told has a right to know the truth, or there
<PB N="15" REF="019258_0008_0FAA6A1A3370CAF0">would have been no occa&s;ion to have framed a fal&s;ehood. This per&s;on, of cour&s;e, will think him&s;elf ill treated for being a &s;econd time affronted; for what can be a greater affront than an attempt to impo&s;e upon any man's under&s;tanding? Be&s;ides, lying, in excu&s;e for a fault, betrays fear than which nothing is more da&s;tardly, and unbecoming the character of a gentle|man.</P>
<P>There is nothing more manly, or more noble, if we have done wrong, than frankly to own it. It is the only way of meeting forgivene&s;s. Indeed, confe&s;&s;ing a fault and a&s;king pardon, with great minds, is con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient atonement. <Q>I have been betrayed into an error,</Q> or, <Q>I have injured you, Sir, and am heartily a&s;hamed of it, and forty for it,</Q> has frequently di&s;armed the per|&s;on injured, and where he would have been ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e him our friend.</P>

There are per&s;ons al&s;o, who&s;e <HI>va|nity</HI> leads them to tell a thou&s;and lies.

<HEAD>GOOD-BREEDING.</HEAD>
<P>VOID of good breeding, every other qualification will be im|perfect unadorned, and to a certain degree unavailing.</P>
<P>Good breeding being the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e and good nature, is it not wonderful that people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the one &s;hould be deficient in the other? The modes of it varving according to per&s;ons, places, and circum&s;tances, cannot indeed be acquired otherwi&s;e than by time and ob&s;ervation, but the &s;ub&s;tance is every where and always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What good morals are to &s;ociety in general, good manners are to parti|cular
<PB N="19" REF="019258_0010_0FAA6A1BAD9A7428">ones; their band and &s;ecurity. Of all actions, next to that of per|forming a good one, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rendering a civility is the mo&s;t grateful.</P>
<P>We &s;eldom &s;ee a per&s;on, let him be ever &s;o ill-bred, wanting in re&s;pect to tho&s;e whom he acknowledges to be his &s;uperiors; the manner of &s;hewing this re&s;pect then is all I contend for. The well-bred man expre&s;&s;es it natu|rally and ea&s;ily, while he who is un|u&s;ed to good company expre&s;&s;es it awkwardly. Study, then, to &s;hew that re&s;pect which every one wi&s;hes to &s;hew in an ea&s;y and grateful way; but this mu&s;t be learnt by ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In company with your equals or in mixed companies, a greater lati|tude may be take in your behaviour; yet, it &s;hould never exceed the bounds of decency; for though no one in this ca&s;e can claim any di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect, every one is entitled to civility and good manners. A man

Such liberties are offen&s;ive to our equals, and in&s;ult|ing to our inferiors. Ea&s;ine&s;s of car|riage by no means implies inattention and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. No one is at liberty to act in all re&s;pects, as he plea&s;es; but is bound by the laws of good manners to behave with decorum.</P>
<P>Let a man talk to you ever &s;o &s;tu|pidly or frivolou&s;ly, not to pay &s;ome attention to what he &s;ays, is &s;avage|ne&s;s, to the greate&s;t degree. Nay if he even forces his conver&s;ation to you, it is wor&s;e than rudne&s;s not to li&s;ten to him; for your inattention in this ca&s;e, tells him, in expre&s;s terms, that you think him a blockhead and not worth the hearing. Now, if &s;uch behaviour is rude to men, it is much more &s;o to
<PB N="21" REF="019258_0011_0FAA6A1C6A551110">women, who, be their rank what it will, have on account of their &s;ex, a claim to officious attention from the men.

<P>In promi&s;cuous companies, you &s;hould vary your addre&s;s, aggreeable to the different ages of the per&s;ons you &s;peak to. It would be rude and ab&s;urd to talk of your amours or your plea&s;ures to men of certain dignity and gravity to clergy men, or men in years; but &s;till you &s;hould be as ea&s;y with them as with others, your man|ner only &s;hould be varied; you &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible double your re&s;pect and at|tention to them; and were you to in|&s;inuate occa&s;ionally, that from their ob&s;ervation and experience you wi&s;h to profit, you would in&s;en&s;ibly win

Confu&s;ed and a|&s;hamed, he &s;tumbles to the upper end of the room, and &s;eats him&s;elf in the very chair he &s;hould not. He there begins playing with his hat, which he pre&s;ently drops; and recovering his hat, he lets fall his cane; and in pick|ing up his cane, down goes his hat again; thus 'tis a con&s;iderable time before he is a du&s;ted. When his tea or coffee is handed to him, he &s;preads his handkerchief upon his knees, &s;calds his mouth, drops either the cup or the &s;acuer, and &s;pills the tea or coffee in his lap. At dinner he is more uncommonly awkward; there he tucks his napkin through a button|hole which tickles his chin, and oc|ca&s;ions him to make a variety of wry faces; he &s;eats him&s;elf upon the edge of the chair, at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the table, that he frequently drops his

If he is to carve, he cannot hit the joint, but in labouring to cut through the bone, &s;pla&s;hes the &s;auce over every body's cloths. He gener|ally daubs him&s;elf all over, his elbows are in the next per&s;on's plate, and he is up to the knuckles in &s;oup and grea&s;e. If he drinks, it is with his mouth full, interrupting the whole company wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> "To your good health, &s;ir," and "My &s;ervice to you," perhaps coughs in his gla&s;s, and he &s;prinkles the whole table.

<P>You may al&s;o know a well-bred per&s;on by his manner of &s;itting.

<P>AS the art of plea&s;ing is to be learnt only by frequenting the be&s;t companies, we mu&s;t endeavor to pick it up in &s;uch companies, by ob|&s;ervation; for it is not &s;en&s;e and knowledge alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that will acquire e&s;teem; the&s;e certainly are the fir&s;t and

In this fa&s;hionable good company alone, can you learn the be&s;t manners and the be&s;t language: for, as there is no legal &s;tandard to form them by, 'tis here they are e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>Though the company of men of learning and genius is highly to be valued and occa&s;ionally coveted, I would by no means have you always found in &s;uch company. As they do not live in the world, they cannot have that ea&s;y manner and addre&s;s which

<P>Though <HI>you</HI> may think &s;uch a caution unnece&s;&s;ary, I do not; for many a young gentleman of &s;en&s;e and rank, has been led by his vanity

<P N="1">1. to do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the out-lines of a well-bred man; and to carve well, is an article, little as it may &s;eem, that is u&s;eful twice every day, and the do|ing of which ill, is not only trouble|&s;ome to one's &s;elf, but renders us di&s;|agreeable and ridiculous to others.

<P N="3">3. Drinking of healths is now growing out of fa&s;hion, and is very unpolite in good company. Cu&s;tom had once made it univer&s;al, but the improved manners of the age now render it vulgar. What can be more rude or ridiculous than to interrupt per&s;ons at their meals, with an unne|ce&s;&s;ary compliment? Ab&s;tain then from this &s;illy cu&s;tom where you find it out of u&s;e; and u&s;e it only at tho&s;e tables where it continues general.</P>
<P N="4">4. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">polite manner of refu&s;ing to comply with the &s;olicitations of a com|pany, is al&s;o very nece&s;&s;ary to be learnt; for, a young man, who &s;eems to have no will of his own, but does every

<P N="5">5. Now I am on the &s;ubject of cads, I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the nece&s;&s;ity of playing them well and genteely, if you would be thought to have kept good company. I would by no means recommend playing of cards as a part of your &s;tudy, left you &s;hould grow too fond of it, and the con&s;equences prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but as cu&s;tom has introduced inno|cent card playing at mo&s;t friendly meetings, it marks the gentleman to handle them genteely, and play them well; and as I hope you will play on|ly for &s;mall &s;ums, &s;hould you lo&s;e your money pray lo&s;e it with temper; or win, receive your winnings with|out either elation or greedine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. To write well and correct, and in a plea&s;ing &s;tile, is another part of polite education. Every man who
<PB N="89" REF="019258_0045_0FAA6993A71318F8">has the u&s;e of his eyes and his right hand can write whatever hand he plea&s;es. Nothing is &s;o illiberal as a &s;chool-boy's &s;crawl. I would not have you learn a &s;tiff formal hand|writing, like that of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, but a genteel, legible and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the correctne&s;s and elegancy of your writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the be&s;t au|thors, the other. Epi&s;tolary cor|re&s;pondence &s;hould not be carried on in a &s;tudied or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fected &s;tyle, but the language &s;hould flow from the pen, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and as ea&s;i|ly as it would from the mouth.

<P N="7">7. If writing well &s;hews the gentle|man, much more &s;o does &s;pelling well. It is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that
<PB N="90" REF="019258_0046_0FAA6993F8FE06E0">one fal&s;e &s;pelling may fix a ridicule on him for the remainder of his life. Words in books are generally well &s;pelled, according to the orthogra|phy of the age; reading, therefore, with attention, will teach every one to &s;pell right. It &s;ometimes happens that words &s;hall be &s;pelled differently by different authors: but if you &s;pell them upon the authority of one, in e&s;timation of the public, you will e&s;cape ridicule. Where there is but one way of &s;pelling a word, by your &s;pelling it wrong you will be &s;ure to be laughed at. For a <HI>woman</HI> of a tolerable education would laugh at and de&s;pi&s;e her lover, if he wrote to her, and the words were ill &s;pelled. Be particularly attentive then to your &s;pelling.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is nothing that a young man, at his fir&s;t appearance in life, ought more to dread, than having any ridicule fixed on him. In the e&s;tima|tion,
<PB N="91" REF="019258_0046_0FAA6993F8FE06E0">even of the mo&s;t rational men, it will le&s;&s;en him, but r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in him with all the re&s;t. Many a man has been undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The cau&s;es of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or ad|dre&s;s. To have the appellation of ill-bred, awkward, muttering, left-legged, or any other tacked always to your name, would injure you more than you are aware of; avoid then the&s;e little defects (and they are ea&s;ily avoided) and you need never fear a nick-name.</P>
<P N="9">9. Some young men are apt to think, that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of plea&s;ure; and the rake they often mi&s;take for the man of plea&s;ure. A take is made up of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;graceful vices. They all con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine to degrade his character and ruin his health and fortune. A man
<PB N="92" REF="019258_0047_0FAA6994B07D8B30">of plea&s;ure will refine upon the enjoyments of the age attend them with decency and partake of them becomingly. Indeed, he is too often le&s;s &s;crupulous than he &s;hould be, and frequently has cau&s;e to repent it. A man of plea&s;ure, at be&s;t, is but a di&s;&s;ipated being, and what the rational part of man|kind mu&s;t abhor; I mention it, however, le&s;t in taking up the man of plea&s;ure, you &s;hould fall into the rake: for of two evils always chu&s;e the lea&s;t. A di&s;&s;olute, flagitious foot-man may make as good a rake as a man of the fir&s;t quality. Few men can be men of plea&s;ure; every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity that &s;hould be pre&s;erved in all our plea&s;ures; in love a man may lo&s;e his heart, without lo&s;ing his no&s;e; at table a man may have a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing palate, without being a glutton; he may love wine without
<PB N="93" REF="019258_0047_0FAA6994B07D8B30">being a drunkard; he may game without being a gambler; and &s;o on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every plea&s;ure its neigh|bouring di&s;grace. Temperance and moderation mark the gentleman; but exce&s;s the blackguard. Attend care|fully, then, to the line that divides them; and remember, &s;top rather a yard &s;hort, than &s;tep an inch beyond it.

As to a mimick or a wag, he is little el&s;e than a buffoon, who will di&s;tort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be a&s;&s;ured, no one per&s;on ever demeaned him&s;elf to plea&s;e the re&s;t, unle&s;s he wi&s;hed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is re&s;pectable, I will leave you to judge.</P>
<P>If a man's company is coveted on any other account than his knowledge, his good &s;en&s;e, or his manners, he is &s;eldom re&s;pected by tho&s;e who invite him, but made u&s;e of only to enter|tain. "Let's have &s;uch-a-one, for he &s;ings a good &s;ong, or he is always joking or laughing;" or "Let's &s;end for &s;uch a one, for he is a good bottle companion;" the&s;e are degrad|ing di&s;tinctions, that preclude all re&s;pect and e&s;teem. Whoever <HI>is had</HI> (as the phra&s;e is) for the &s;ake of any qualification &s;ingly, is merely that thing he <HI>is had</HI> for, is never con&s;i|dered in any other light, and, of

<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e this dig|nity of manners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from blu&s;tering.</P>
<P>To flatter a per&s;on right or wrong, is abject flattery, and to con&s;ent rea|dily to do every thing propo&s;ed by a company, be it &s;illy or criminal is full as degrading as to di&s;pute warmly upon every &s;ubject, and to contradict upon all occa&s;ions. To pre&s;erve dig|nity, we &s;hould mode&s;tly a&s;&s;ert our own &s;entiments, though we politely acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>So again, to &s;upport dignity of character, we &s;hould neither be frivo|lou&s;ly curious about trifles, nor be laboriou&s;ly intent upon little objects that de&s;erve not a moments attention; for this implies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</P>
<P>A great deal likewi&s;e depends upon our air, addre&s;s and expre&s;&s;ions; an awkward addre&s;s and vulgar expre&s;|&s;ions;

<P>In&s;olent contempt, or low envy, is incompatible al&s;o with dignity of manners. Low bred per&s;ons, fortu|nately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will in|&s;olently look down on all tho&s;e who cannot afford to make as good an appearance, and they openly envy tho&s;e who perhaps make a better. They al&s;o dread the being &s;lighted; of cour&s;e are &s;u&s;picious, and captious; are unea&s;y them&s;elves and make eve|ry body el&s;e &s;o about them.</P>
<P>A certain degree of outward &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s in looks and actions gives dignity, while a con&s;tant &s;mirk upon the face (that in&s;ipid &s;illy &s;mile, which fools have when they would be civil) and whiffling motions, are &s;trong marks of futility.</P>
<P>But above all a dignity of charac|ter is to be acquired be&s;t by a certain firmne&s;s in all our actions. A mean,

<P>If you di&s;cover any ha&s;tine&s;s in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expre&s;|&s;ions, watch it narrowly, and endea|vour to crub it; but let no com|plai&s;ance, no weak de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, no wheedling urge you to do that which di&s;cretion forbids; but per&s;i&s;t and per&s;evere in all that is right.

In|vite and pre&s;erve attachments by your firmne&s;s: but labour to keep clear of enemies, by a mildne&s;s of behavi|our. Di&s;arm tho&s;e enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are without them) by a gentlene&s;s of manner, but make them feel the &s;teadine&s;s of your ju&s;t re&s;entment!
<PB N="119" REF="019258_0060_0FAA69A011F6A9D0">for there is a wide difference between bearing malice and a determined &s;elf|defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>In directing your &s;ervants, or any per&s;on you have a right to command; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging manner which every gentleman &s;hould &s;tudy to do, you would be chearfully, and con&s;equent|ly well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly &s;erv|ed if &s;erved at all.

<P N="2">2. Avoid telling &s;tories in com|pany, unle&s;s they are very &s;hort in|deed, and very applicable to the &s;ubject you are upon; in this ca&s;e relate them in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, without the lea&s;t digre&s;&s;ion, and with &s;ome apology; as that you hate the telling of &s;tories, but the &s;hortne&s;s of it induced you.

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. Digre&s;&s;ions, likewi&s;e, &s;hould be guarded again&s;t. A &s;tory is always more agreeable without them.

<P N="5">5. Some people have a trick of holding the per&s;ons they are &s;peaking to by the button, or the hand, in or|der to be heard out; con&s;cious, I &s;uppo&s;e, that their tale is tire&s;ome. Pray never do this: if the per&s;on you &s;peak to is not as willing to hear your &s;tory, as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the mid|dle; for if you tire them once, they will be afraid to li&s;ten to you a &s;econd time.</P>
<P N="6">6. Others have a way of punch|ing the per&s;on they are talking to in the &s;ide, and at the end of every, &s;en|tence,

Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the conver&s;ation, and to deprive him of it is not only unju&s;t, but a tacit de|claration that he cannot &s;peak &s;o well upon the &s;ubject as your&s;elf; you will therefore take it up. And what can be more rude? I would as &s;oon forgive a man that &s;hould &s;top my mouth when I was gaping, as take my words from me while I was &s;peak|ing them.

"I'll bet you fifty of it, and &s;o on." Make it then a con&s;tant rule in mat|ters of no great importance, complai|&s;antly to &s;ubmit your opinion to that of others; for a victory of this kind often co&s;ts a man the lo&s;s of a friend.</P>
