<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I was earne&s;tly de&s;ired to print the following Di&s;cour&s;e; and could not be without hopes that &s;o plain an attempt to magnify Chri&s;t, might be followed with his ble&s;|&s;ing; what determined me was an apprehen&s;ion that it might &s;erve, with &s;ome enlargements, in lieu of my <HI>Examination</HI> of Mr. <HI>Cumming</HI>'s <HI>Animad|ver&s;ions</HI> on my letter to him&s;elf, and Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s remarks upon it. The great de&s;ign of which was to bear te&s;timony again&s;t that doctrine which I had oppo&s;ed in the &s;ermon, without the lea&s;t thoughts of printing, viz. That men love God and truly repent of their &s;ins, <HI>before</HI> they believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE piece would have been printed in Mr. <HI>Cumming</HI>'s life time, had I not waited for his <HI>&s;econd part</HI> which he promi&s;ed the public. The printer's going away la&s;t winter for the &s;mall pox, prevented its being publi&s;hed then. Providential hindrances have had their weight: And be&s;ides, tho' Mr. <HI>Cumming</HI> was treated with decency, there were &s;ome things in it, that would not read &s;o well as if he were now living. I never differ'd with that Gentleman in anger; and when he died, I mourned for him as a brother. Nor did the death of any one ever &s;o throughly convince me of that &s;olemn truth, viz. that the <HI>graves were ready for me.</HI> However, when death hath appear'd mo&s;t near I have thought I &s;hould &s;in
<PB N="ii" REF="009945_0004_0F7B3AF46C72BD08">again&s;t the God of my life, if I did not endeavour to remove the vail which he hath ca&s;t over the <HI>glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</HI> They are but poor friends to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who are not willing he &s;hould be magnified, without any regard to <HI>man.</HI> Were the faints in heaven to know what is done on earth, they would rejoice at the con|futation of any tenets, which they once, thro' mi&s;take, thought for the glory of the Lamb <HI>that was &s;lain.</HI> 'Twas hoped, as was &s;aid, that print|ing <HI>this</HI> would make the <HI>Examination</HI> needle&s;s; &s;ince oppo&s;ing the beforementioned doctrine was the only thing that &s;eem'd to make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to write at all. My character did not ap|pear to &s;uffer: The writings of tho&s;e divines could never convince people that it was bla&s;phemy in me to hold no <HI>man can love God while he looks upon him as his everla&s;ting enemy.</HI> The little odium of my being a &s;eparati&s;t is removed in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>I have only to add my prayers, that God's ble&s;&s;ing may accompany what is agreeable to his word, and that we all may be heartily convinced of the&s;e truths, viz. <HI>That all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God;</HI> and <HI>that we are ju&s;tified freely by his grace thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL of us &s;tand in need of ju&s;tification; for, as Paul &s;aith, all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God: And then comes in the &s;weet go&s;pel&mdash;we are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace, thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He knew that he him&s;elf was ju&s;tified freely by God's grace thro' the Re|deemer; and was forever harping on that divine &s;tring. When mini&s;ters <HI>believe,</HI> and <HI>therefore &s;peak;</HI> when they know that ju&s;tification is quite free; 'tis &s;weeter to them than the honey, and the honey-comb, to bear witne&s;s for God, that great &s;inners, even the chief of &s;inners, are wel|come to ju&s;tification thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009945_0006_0F7B3AF5C8DD9F70">
IN &s;peaking to the&s;e words, I propo&s;e to ob&s;erve the following method, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To &s;hew that God made man for his own glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT we are therefore by con&s;equence in a &s;tate of condemnation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT tho' we are naturally in &s;uch a mi&s;erable &s;tate, we are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. TO improve and apply what &s;hall have been &s;aid under the foregoing heads; bringing all home to our particular ca&s;es, and to our hearts and con&s;ciences too by the ble&s;&s;ing of God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>According to this method&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to &s;hew that God made man for his own glory. 'Tis implied, that God made man for his own glory in the text. Coming &s;hort of God's glory, is coming &s;hort of the end for which man was made; and God's glory is his end in all things. He can have no higher end than his own glory. Rea&s;onable creatures &s;hould aim higher than their own glory, even at the glory of God. But God him&s;elf can aim no higher, than that he him&s;elf &s;hould be glorified. All things were made to glorify him. For his own glory he made angels, archangels, and all the ho&s;ts of heaven. For his glory he made the firmament, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, the earth and the &s;eas, and all things therein, whe|ther animate or inanimate; and particularly for this end did he make man the lord of this lower creation&mdash;that he might &s;hew forth his creator's glory. He made him little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour, expecting that man would honour him, the foun|tain
<PB N="3" REF="009945_0007_0F7B3AF648B8C1F0">of his honour, and give him the glory due to his name. Not that man, or any creatures, even the mo&s;t exalted, can make God more glorious than he is. For his glory is e&s;&s;ential and eternal; and can neither admit of increa&s;e or diminution. And be&s;ides, creatures receive their all from him: For <HI>of him and through him and to him are all things,</HI> to whom be glory forever. But man, as other beings, glorifies God by owning him to be &s;uch a glorious being as he is, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite excellencies and perfections. Nor doth God want to be prai&s;ed and glori|fied by the works of his hands, from any thing analagous to what there is in man, which makes him plea&s;ed with the prai&s;es and acclamations of others; but he would be glorified and prai&s;ed, becau&s;e <HI>prai&s;e is comely,</HI> rea&s;onable and decent; and becau&s;e glorifying him is enjoying him: The fruition of God, and giving him glory, are joined together on earth as well as in heaven. I am now,</P>
<P N="2">IIdly, To &s;hew that all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God; which are the very words of in&s;pired Paul. God's creatures, as was ob&s;erved, glorify him by owning him to be &s;uch a being as he is. So <HI>the heavens &s;hew forth the glory of the Lord, and the firmament his handy work: Day unto day uttereth &s;peech, night unto night &s;heweth knowledge.</HI> The <HI>invi&s;ible things</HI> of him, <HI>from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</HI> The heavenly ho&s;ts actively glorify their maker; by doing his will, and by their cea&s;ele&s;s hallelujahs they own him to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, holine&s;s, power, goodne&s;s and truth. And as tho&s;e beings honour and glorify God actively, and pa&s;&s;ively, who own and acknowledge his glorious perfections; &s;o they come &s;hort of his glory, who will not a&s;cribe to him the glory that is his due. This is the ca&s;e of devils, and of the children of men by nature. Both men and devils have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God. The angels
<PB N="4" REF="009945_0008_0F7B3AF703CF1900">who kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but fell by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, denied the God above to be &s;uch a glorious being as he is. Our fir&s;t parents al&s;o, by the in&s;tigation of the <HI>evil one,</HI> &s;inned again&s;t God, and in effect denied him to be infi|nitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, powerful, good and true. And as did Adam and Eve, &s;o do all their po&s;terity, by ordinary generation. We derive not only guilt from them (by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners) but an impure and &s;inful nature, a bent and bya&s;s to depart from the living God. As a fountain ca&s;teth forth its waters, &s;o our hearts ca&s;t forth their wickedne&s;s. We rob God of his glory; in&s;tead of glorifying God with our bodies and &s;pirits which are his; we improve the powers of our &s;ouls, and the members of our bodies, as in&s;truments of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s unto wickedne&s;s: We virtually deny all the glorious perfections of his nature. This is the ca&s;e as Paul &s;uppo&s;es of all; for he &s;aith all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God; and el&s;ewhere that the whole world are guilty; that God hath concluded all under &s;in; and that every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped.</P>
<P N="3">III. I AM now to &s;hew that <HI>having &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God,</HI> man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily by con&s;e|quence be in a &s;tate of condemnation. This is implied: For if all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God; and if we &s;tand in need of ju&s;tification by the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, then man is in a &s;tate of condemna|tion, and obnoxious to the divine wrath. And accordingly the apo&s;tle &s;aith, men are all by nature the children of wrath, Eph. II. v. 3. So we read, that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven <HI>again&s;t all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and ungodline&s;s of men;</HI> and <HI>that for &s;uch things &s;ake cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di&s;obedience.</HI>&mdash; As the angels who did not keep their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but &s;inned and came &s;hort of the glory of God, are re&s;erved in chains under darkne&s;s, and &s;uffer the divine wrath; &s;o all men naturally, and without Chri&s;t, are expo&s;ed to &s;uffer the
<PB N="5" REF="009945_0009_0F7B3AF7CA306600">wrath and vengeance of God with them. Hence the doom of tho&s;e who live according to the bya&s;s of nature, and die in their &s;ins, will be, depart ye cur&s;ed into <HI>ever|la&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</HI> The</P>
<P N="4">IVth POINT is to make it appear that tho' all have &s;inned and come &s;hort <HI>of the glory of God, we are ju&s;tified freely by his grace, thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>OH! this is good news. There is not one of you who hath &s;eriou&s;ly attended to what hath been &s;poken, but he mu&s;t have a de&s;ire to hear about free ju&s;tification by God's grace thro' the redeemer. Tho' God had thoughts of mercy for poor &s;inners from eternity, he was re&s;olved to be merciful to them in &s;uch a way as might not be inju|rious to his ju&s;tice; for ju&s;tice is e&s;&s;ential to God as well as mercy: He will by no means clear the guilty, without &s;atisfaction to his ju&s;tice: He had rather the whole world &s;hould have peri&s;hed eternally, than any one &s;hould be ju&s;tified and &s;aved in &s;uch a way as would in the lea&s;t reflect upon his ju&s;tice. <HI>To declare, I &s;ay, at this time his righteou&s;|ne&s;s, that he might be ju&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;God was determimed to ju&s;tify and &s;ave &s;inners &s;o that he might declare him&s;elf to be a <HI>ju&s;t God and a Saviour.</HI> The Father and Son were equally engaged in the redemption of &s;inners&mdash;And 'twas determined that the redeemer &s;hould come to Zion, and in a body prepared for him make atonement for &s;in by dying on the cro&s;s&mdash;And accordingly when the fulne&s;s of time was come, the Son of God became the &s;on of man; being made of a woman and made under the law, after he had perfectly obeyed the law for us, he was made a cur&s;e for us, by dying the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s, that he might redeem us from the cur&s;e of the law, and reconcile us to God: The blood of one who was God as well as man, and (hence called <HI>the blood of God,</HI> Acts xx. 28.) being of <HI>infinite merit.</HI> Accordingly we read the Me&s;&s;iah was cut off, <HI>but not for him&s;elf;</HI> that <HI>God laid on him the iniquity of us all;</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="009945_0010_0F7B3AF8D65A1778">that <HI>he made him &s;in for us who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him;</HI> that we have <HI>re|demption thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;in, according to the riches of God's grace.</HI> And &s;o in our text Paul &s;aith we are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace <HI>thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> So that it appears now, we are welcome to ju&s;tification for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, without bringing any thing of our own to recommend us to God. We are ju&s;tified only by Chri&s;t; and tho' our ju&s;tification co&s;t him his heart's blood, he having paid the utmo&s;t farthing for it; yet this glorious priviledge comes freely to us; it comes of <HI>meer grace;</HI> not by the grace that is wrought <HI>in us,</HI> as papi&s;ts teach, confounding ju&s;tification with &s;anctifi|cation; but by the gracious favour of God to us, without any worthine&s;s at all.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;aid Jo&s;eph <HI>found grace in the eyes of his</HI> ma&s;ter, Gen. xxxix. v. 4. But there was a rea&s;on for it: <HI>He &s;aw that every thing that he did pro&s;pered.</HI> There was &s;ome|thing in Jo&s;eph to invite that grace. But the favour of God comes to us thro' Chri&s;t <HI>freely: freely:</HI> Freely and grace &s;ignify the &s;ame thing: The truth is <HI>doubled</HI> that it may be the more <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> There is not a &s;weeter pa&s;&s;age in the whole bible; 'tis enough to make the heart of any one that believes it <HI>leap for joy.</HI> That al&s;o which I mentioned before is &s;imilar: We have re|demption thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, according to the riches of God's grace; i. e. according to the exceeding, abundant and overflowing grace and mercy of God. Agreeably hereto, I&s;aiah &s;aith, chap. lv. v. 1. in the name of God, Ho every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters&mdash;and in Rev. xxii. v. 17. we read&mdash;Who&s;oever will <HI>let him take of the water of life freely.</HI> So that it is plain that as things now are, as Chri&s;t hath wrought out redemption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;t redeems us by power as well as price, but the latter is here chiefly &s;poken of.</NOTE> for us, we are all of us welcome to the pardon
<PB N="7" REF="009945_0011_0F7B3AF94D6DDDC0">of &s;in, and the ju&s;tification of our per&s;ons, without bring|ing any thing of our own to recommend us to the divine favour. Nor, let any perplex the doctrine of free grace with the divine decree. We mu&s;t not blend the grant and the decree together. But con&s;ider the grant ab&s;tractedly from the decree, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall make confu&s;ion, Ac|cordingly, tho' the apo&s;tles held the divine decree, they preached ju&s;tification as freely as if there had been no decree at all. And, in imitation of them, we may &s;ay to every one who comes to hear the go&s;pel, <HI>to you is the word of this &s;alvation &s;ent; thro' this man is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> and the ju&s;tification of your per&s;ons. Nor let any one think that the go&s;pel is to be preached thus; that men are welcome to be ju&s;tified for Chri&s;t's &s;ake <HI>if they have</HI> faith. If they know they have not faith, they are welcome <HI>now,</HI> believing our text to be true, to apply to them&s;elves <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Great oppo&s;ition hath been made of late, to the appropriation of faith; and that not only from the <HI>Arminian</HI> quarter, but from &s;ome who <HI>mo&s;t clearly</HI> maintain ju&s;tification by <HI>Chri&s;t alone.</HI> And yet it mu&s;t needs be that there was appropriation in Abraham's faith; and if in his, then in our's. For Paul in&s;i&s;ts (Rom. IV.) that all believers are ju&s;tified the &s;ame way with father Abraham But if he appropriated, and we do not; then he was ju&s;tified one way, and we another; there is an e&s;&s;ential difference between his ju&s;tifying faith and our's. If the divinity of our opponents is true, it don't appear that the go&s;pel of peace will, when believed, bring any rational peace into the &s;oul. If, as the author of the letters on <HI>Theron and A&s;pa&s;io</HI> &s;aith (Vol. II. p. 83.) When a man hath ju&s;tifying &s;aith in the highe&s;t degree, he &s;ees him&s;elf entirely at the &s;overeign mercy of God, <HI>without any claim on God what&s;oever,</HI> by virtue of his promi&s;es; what ground will he have for peace? For when a rea&s;onable creature is in danger, it is but rea&s;onable to be afraid. <HI>I will tru&s;t and not be afraid,</HI> &s;aith I&s;aiah xii. v. 2. implying, that till a man &s;ees him|&s;elf &s;afe, he mu&s;t be <HI>afraid</HI> or <HI>&s;tupid.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that the&s;e writers are &s;o far from treading in the foot&s;teps of the flock, that one may challenge them to find, if they can, in the writings of any learned divines from the beginning, <HI>their</HI> doctrine of <HI>per|fectly free ju&s;tification,</HI> and yet <HI>no ground</HI> for <HI>appropriation.</HI> They will &s;ay, 'tis enough that it is in the bible. But if it were really there (as I am per&s;uaded it is not) it would be &s;trange, if it were to be found only in the bible and in their writings. For 'tis not ea&s;y to believe that the true go&s;pel of Chri&s;t hath been hid from &s;o many ages and generations, but in the&s;e la&s;t days hath been revealed to Mr. <HI>Glas</HI> and his adherents.
<P>I fini&s;h with noting, &s;o great is the force of truth, that the before|mentioned writer is &s;ometimes very friendly to that doctrine, which at other times he takes &s;uch pains to confute. But no where more &s;o than in the &s;imile (which mu&s;t be under&s;tood as giving his &s;enti|ments) of a rich man's cau&s;ing to be proclaimed in a time of famine: <Q>Who&s;oever will, let him come and take corn at my granary freely; and the &s;tarving per&s;on's &s;eeing him&s;elf meant by the proclamation, and encouraging him&s;elf, that he &s;hould not &s;tarve or want, becau&s;e he was faithful who had promi&s;ed.</Q> Vol. II. p. 306. Neither Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> nor any of us, ever held any other appropriation, than what is evidently contained in this &s;imile.</P></NOTE> the redemption purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="009945_0012_0F7B3AFA01559D20">or to expect ju&s;tification from God for his &s;ake. For all things are now ready; the chief of &s;inners are welcome; and him that cometh to God for ju&s;tification, encouraged by God's word, <HI>he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW proceed to improve and apply the di&s;cour&s;e, And</P>
<P N="1">I. HENCE we learn the woful depravity of man by the fall of Adam, for <HI>all have &s;inned</HI> and come &s;hort of <HI>the glory of God.</HI> Indeed God made man upright; he made him little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour. But how is the gold become dim, and the fine gold changed! Man, once almo&s;t angelick, is now become lower than the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h: For they have not <HI>come &s;hort of the glory of God,</HI> but prai&s;e their maker, and an&s;wer the end of their creation. Some deny this original depravity derived from Adam the &s;inner; and &s;ay men learn wickedne&s;s of one another, and are depraved by examples. And indeed evil examples are corrupting; but this will not account for the world lying in wicked|ne&s;s&mdash;Mankind could never have univer&s;ally corrupted
<PB N="9" REF="009945_0013_0F7B3AFC635E8CD8">their ways, had they not derived a vitiated nature from their fir&s;t progenitor. The wi&s;er heathens &s;aw this pro|pen&s;ity to &s;in, contrary to the light of nature and con|&s;cience, but were puzzled to find the origin. The &s;crip|ture informs us, that being de&s;cended from fallen Adam, we are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the womb, and have a natural propen&s;ity to &s;in again&s;t God, and &s;o to <HI>come &s;hort of his glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. WE learn hence, the adorable conde&s;cen&s;ion and love of God, that &s;uch depraved and peri&s;hing creatures &s;hould be redeemed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t!

<P>AND have our di&s;coveries of Chri&s;t and free ju&s;|tification purified us inwardly and outwardly, making us like unto Chri&s;t the righteous; for only he that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous, even as he is righteous: For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the a&s;hes of an heifer &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h; how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t, who thro' the eternal &s;pirit offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God, purge our con&s;ciences from dead works to &s;erve the living God? This precious blood &s;prinkled by faith, al|ways influences men to an&s;wer the redeemer's end in &s;hedding it, by <HI>dying unto &s;in and living unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>ONCE more: Know we any thing of that divine peace, which ju&s;tified ones are the &s;ubjects of? Rom. V. v. 1. Nay, 'tis reckoned the common experience of &s;uch per|&s;ons, that they joy in God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, having received the attonement. V. 2. I know that now a days per&s;ons are looked on as eminent chri&s;tians, tho' they are eminently &s;trangers to that joy which is the fruit of the &s;pirit: Nay, I once heard it declared by a man of &s;ome note, of a certain woman; <Q>that for forty years, &s;he had been looked on as the be&s;t chri&s;tian in the pari&s;h; and that for the whole time &s;he appeared to be ca&s;t down and void of comfort.</Q> There is no doubt that a real chri&s;tian may have an horror of darkne&s;s fall upon him, as fell on Abraham the father of the faithful; and fre&s;h guilt will bring trouble into the &s;oul. But as for tho&s;e who go on habitually under legal darkne&s;s, being afraid of
<PB N="19" REF="009945_0023_0F7B3B0662C72ED8">hell and the wrath to come, mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are authorized to tell them, that they do not <HI>walk humbly with God;</HI> that their gloomine&s;s is the effect of de&s;pi&s;ing the blood of Chri&s;t, by which we are ju&s;tified; that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible any one &s;hould believe the glad tidings of the go&s;pel to be true, without having &s;ome gladne&s;s in his heart at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>IF, according to what hath been &s;aid, you have rea&s;on to think you are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace, thro' the re|demption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; prai&s;e God, who by his &s;pirit hath influenced you to believe what naturally a man can no more believe <HI>with his heart,</HI> than he can make a world, viz. that there is free ju&s;tification for un|godly &s;inners thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Before you were divinely enlightened, you could not help <HI>&s;tumbling at this &s;tumbling &s;tone:</HI> For it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be true. The law &s;aith <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die;</HI> and rea&s;on can &s;ee no further than God's <HI>ju&s;tifying the godly.</HI> But God, by rai&s;ing up his &s;on Je&s;us from the dead, hath given us a new idea of him&s;elf, which no man can heartily be recon|ciled to, till God who cau&s;ed the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hines into his heart by his holy &s;pirit. This in the apo&s;tles time was called the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching: And all who have faithfully preached it ever &s;ince, have been accounted fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. If we preach ju&s;tification only for <HI>the godly,</HI> the offence of the cro&s;s cea&s;eth; and men who &s;corn the thoughts of being ju&s;tified as ungodly &s;inners, may call us rational preachers, and their mouths be filled with our prai&s;es. But the fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than men. We glory in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. The applau&s;es of all the men upon earth are contemned. This is our divine joy, our glory and honour, that we are counted worthy to &s;uffer &s;hame, for preaching <HI>free ju&s;tifi|cation for ungodly &s;inners, thro' the redemption there is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to return: If we are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace, then let us live holy and godly lives. Shall we &s;in
<PB N="20" REF="009945_0024_0F7B3B06CCE2FEF8">becau&s;e grace abounds? God forbid! Yea, rather let the abounding of grace be the killing of &s;in in us. Let us be jealous over our&s;elves with a godly jealou&s;y: Ble&s;&s;ed is the man who feareth always. The &s;oul is never &s;afe but when afraid; afraid of being left to it&s;elf, and leaning on Je&s;us Chri&s;t for help: When we have this fear, we are &s;trong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Remember we were made to glorify God; and let our di&s;honouring him in times pa&s;t, and e&s;pecially &s;ince we ta&s;ted that the Lord was gracious, influence us to make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives more than ever to glorify him in the world; whereby we &s;hall an&s;wer his end in redeeming us al&s;o; for he gave him&s;elf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us to him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works. And 'tis of &s;uch livers, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>I am glorified in them.</HI> O how &s;trong this argument to one who hath the love of Chri&s;t in his heart! And in this way, be exhorted to take the comfort that belongs to you: Let the righteous rejoice? rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion, &s;hout for joy; ye are ble&s;&s;ed; and &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed forever: for whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified. And indeed if you live lives of holine&s;s; if you live in all good con&s;cience; confe&s;&s;ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t, aiming at his honour and glory; having an holy di&s;regard for your own; he will &s;end the comforter into your hearts; he will manife&s;t him&s;elf unto you; ye &s;hall eat of the hid|den manna, and drink of the water of life; the peace of God which pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding &s;hall keep your hearts and minds thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us; you will not only enter into the joy of your Lord when you die; but &s;hall have the joys of heaven in you while you live.</P>
<P>I would now addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who have no rea|&s;on to think them&s;elves in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification. And here, what &s;hall we &s;ay to the&s;e things: We have all &s;in|ned and come &s;hort of the glory of God. This is our character given by God; and our con&s;ciences mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to it: Every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped&mdash;But be a&s;toni&s;hed O ye heavens at this! We are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace
<PB N="21" REF="009945_0025_0F7B3B078B088238">thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O may not any of you receive the grace of God in vain; turn not the grace of God into wantonne&s;s. Believe the heavenly re|port: Go to God tho' &s;inners, tho' ungodly; and receive the pardon of your &s;ins, and the ju&s;tification <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a man fir&s;t flies to Chri&s;t by faith, he don't believe he is ju&s;tified <HI>already,</HI> or in a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of ju&s;tification. Mr. <HI>Cumming</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> frequently charge me with this tenet: And a <HI>Piece</HI> lately printed in <HI>New Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;hews I am taxed with it by an European writer.

<P>BUT &s;ome one will be ready to &s;ay, mu&s;t I not get a principle of faith fir&s;t, that &s;o I may believe? and is it not my duty to live in the u&s;e of means, and to do all the good works that lie in my power, in hopes of obtaining this principle? I an&s;wer, the apo&s;tles tell us, that when a man believes, there is in him a principle of every thing that is good: But they no where exhort per&s;ons to &s;eek after a good principle fir&s;t, that afterwards they be enabled to believe. Works of <HI>&s;upererogation,</HI> and of <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> are equally <HI>unapo&s;tolical.</HI> Tho' a man who knows he is without faith &s;hould do good works, yet he mu&s;t not think of doing <HI>good works without faith,</HI> in hopes that hereby he
<PB N="22" REF="009945_0026_0F7B3B08CBA59CF8">&s;hall be helped to get faith. When he hears, reads, or prays, &amp;c. he &s;hould con&s;ider the divine report of a mediator, and as the <HI>Scots</HI> divines &s;ay, <HI>mint</HI> at Chri&s;t in everything he does.</P>
<P>PERHAPS another may &s;ay within him&s;elf, I am afraid I have not been under convictions long enough;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some writers give &s;uch long and gloomy accounts of the &s;oul di|&s;tre&s;&s;es requi&s;ite to faith, as have made multitudes tremble at the thoughts of being <HI>altogether chri&s;tians.</HI> The <HI>preparatory terrors</HI> have <HI>made them afraid.</HI> For they have been given to under&s;tand, that they mu&s;t be in mi&s;ery (which all men nece&s;&s;arily hate and &s;hun) for a long time; that 'tis probable the <HI>arrows of the Al|mighty</HI> will &s;tick in them, weeks and months, if not years. Nay, a certain divine tells awakened &s;inners, they mu&s;t not think much of it, if they are under a <HI>&s;pirit of bondage</HI> ten or twenty years, before they find mercy, if ever they find mercy. Such evil and di&s;graceful accounts of the chri&s;tian religion are owing partly to a &s;ort of legal zeal again&s;t &s;in: Chri&s;t and his attonement and free grace being out of &s;ight, it &s;eems agreeable to vindictive ju&s;tice, that the &s;inner, e&s;pecially if he hath been a great &s;inner, &s;hould &s;uffer a great deal for his &s;ins in his own per&s;on. But chiefly to men's mak|ing their own experiences the rule, in&s;tead of the word of God. For 'tis as clear as the meridian &s;un, from the preaching of the apo&s;tles, that they were ignorant of this <HI>preliminary divinity.</HI> They knew nothing of the art of getting people thro' the &s;everal &s;tages of attrition, contrition, and humiliation; of worrying them&punc; &s;tep by &s;tep, from lower to higher degrees of horror and di&s;tre&s;s: And one may be <HI>bold in God</HI> to &s;ay, that treati&s;es of this kind, however pious and learned the authors were, &s;erve to <HI>guide</HI> &s;ouls away from Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</NOTE> 'tis but a few days, or perhaps a le&s;s &s;pace, that I have been in earne&s;t about religion; &s;urely I am not yet prepared for ju&s;tification. Conviction of &s;in is needful: Were there nothing el&s;e, that de&s;cription of believers would prove it; where they are &s;aid to have <HI>fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et before them.</HI> Heb. vi. v. 18. But how long a time were tho&s;e thou&s;ands under convictions, who were wrought upon by Peter's preaching? How long the wo|man of <HI>Samaria,</HI> the jailor, or <HI>Zaccheus?</HI> The latter had only a de&s;ire to &s;ee what &s;ort of a man Chri&s;t was, that he might de&s;cribe him to others&mdash;How &s;oon did he believe to &s;alvation? A man may go into a chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly &s;tupid and unconcerned about the one thing needful, and
<PB N="23" REF="009945_0027_0F7B3B09453DDF88">yet go home to his hou&s;e ju&s;tify'd, and an heir of heaven. The &s;cripture don't at all encourage this round about way: <HI>To-day, while it is called to-day,</HI> we are to <HI>hear God's</HI> voice: <HI>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI> Hear Paul&mdash;<HI>The righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of faith &s;peaketh on this wi&s;e, Say not in thine heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven? (that is to bring Chri&s;t down from above) Or, who &s;hall de&s;cend into the deep? (that is to bring Chri&s;t up again from the dead)&mdash;But what &s;aith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is the word of faith which we preach. That if thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in thine heart, that God rai&s;ed him from the dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s. Believing with the heart, we are ju&s;tified in a moment.</HI></P>
<P>AND if we begin with believing what the God of truth hath &s;aid, the foundation is divine, and our religion will be la&s;ting: Otherwi&s;e, it will be as <HI>the morning cloud and as the early dew, which &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> Hence it is, that &s;o many of late years, who made <HI>a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h,</HI> and even boa&s;ted of their <HI>a&s;&s;urance of eternal life,</HI> have returned like the <HI>dog to his vomit, and like the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire.</HI> Nay, too many of them are &s;ome of the mo&s;t hardned and wicked people in the land. The&s;e per&s;ons never <HI>knew any thing yet as they ought to know.</HI> Their religion was made up of <HI>di&s;tracting fears</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical joys.</HI> They never yet believed that <HI>Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t.</HI> They attained to what they them&s;elves, and others, thought <HI>more &s;piritual and &s;ublime.</HI> But this <HI>low experience</HI> they were &s;trangers to&mdash;otherwi&s;e they would have <HI>been born of God,</HI> and have kept the commandments of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. 1 John V. 1.5. If you receive the go&s;pel <HI>as the word of God,</HI> it <HI>will work effectually;</HI> you will put your tru&s;t in Chri&s;t alone for ju&s;tification; and <HI>the lives you live in the fle&s;h, you will live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved you and gave him&s;elf for you:</HI> Which precious faith, God of his infinite mercy, be&s;tow on us all, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>HAVING &s;hewn, in a printed letter to Mr. <HI>Cumming,</HI> that there was no bla&s;phemy, in my &s;aying <HI>no man can love God while he looks on him as a being that will damn him:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Cumming</HI> owned that was the point in di&s;pute between him and me.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> in his Remarks upon it, attempts to prove by four formal &s;yllogi&s;ms, what no body will deny, viz. <Q>That God is amiable and to be loved by us, tho' he de&s;troys impenitent &s;inners.</Q> And to &s;hew the greatne&s;s and danger of my error in differing from him (tho' I had told him and the world, that in this point, I was like-minded) he makes the following &s;uppo&s;ition, viz.&mdash;<Q>That when Chri&s;t at the day of judgment, hath pronounced <HI>depart ye cur&s;ed</HI> upon the wicked: after this final &s;entence, I am admitted to heaven, to hear the hallelujahs of the ble&s;|&s;ed; and preach as a <HI>Separati&s;t,</HI> the &s;ame doctrine that I preached on earth; that hereby I &s;hould rai&s;e all po&s;|&s;ible indignation in the world above; and all heaven would cry out at once, begone you bla&s;phemer, down to hell, your proper place.</Q> Rem. p. 7.8.&mdash;Tho' it were ea&s;y to make many remarks on this ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition; my de&s;ign is only to take notice of that part of it where he repre&s;ents me as a <HI>&s;eparati&s;t</HI> in heaven, which was no doubt occa&s;ioned by my being in his judgment, a <HI>&s;eparati&s;t</HI> on earth. And ina&s;much as &s;ome others, for want of pro|per information, have run into the &s;ame mi&s;take, I have thought fit to &s;et the matter in a clear light. And for this purpo&s;e, would have it ob&s;erved, that when my people (the &s;econd &s;ociety to which I preached in Bo&s;ton) called me, they declared their de&s;ign was to be only a di&s;tinct, but not a &s;eparate church; and that after &s;ome time I gave

And (which &s;hewed our de&s;ign) we applied to two of the churches in town, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the in|&s;talment. The old &s;outh church, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, cho&s;e a committee to draw up articles to prevent it. 'Tis natu|ral to &s;uppo&s;e, they omitted nothing which they them|&s;elves thought to be of weight: tho' the main thing they had again&s;t me, was my holding the Prote&s;tant and Calvi|ni&s;tical doctrines of faith and repentance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Any one who knows what the prote&s;tant and Calvini&s;tical doctrines of faith and repentance are, and reads our <HI>Narrative</HI> printed on the occa&s;ion, will &s;ee there is no mi&s;repre&s;entation. Tho' I hardly think that at this time of day, they would vote tho&s;e doctrines to be erroneous, and dangerous to the &s;ouls of men.</NOTE> A reply was made (and afterwards printed) which gave full &s;atisfaction to Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> the moderator, and all the other worthy mini&s;ters and me&s;&s;engers of the council&mdash;as they te&s;tified after the in&s;talment in their letter to &s;aid church&mdash;They al&s;o let them know that they &s;aw no difficulty in their proceeding, becau&s;e the church a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>That their de&s;ign was only to be a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> church, being de|&s;irous of holding communion with other churches; there being no objection made to the council as to the moral character of any one of them, or that any of them were under cen&s;ure; and their articles, and church covenant being agreeable to the con&s;titution of the churches of this country.</Q> Such was our beginning. And from that period, there hath not been the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;eparation on our &s;ide. Nor can I think there is any man who thoroughly under&s;tands the affair, and is withal hone&s;t and upright, who will ever publickly or privately bring the charge of &s;eparation again&s;t us.
