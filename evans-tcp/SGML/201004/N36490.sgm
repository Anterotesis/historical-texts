<HEAD>INTRODUCTION BY THE PUBLISHER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> has been acknowledged that <HI>by our Addre&s;s to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI> the We&s;tern Coun|try has had the credit of coming forward fir&s;t to &s;up|port the <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> on the controverted que&s;tion. But, if I am not mi&s;taken in my judgment; it de&s;erves the credit, al&s;o, of having produced the be&s;t rea&s;oning on the que&s;tion, that has appeared, in, or, out of Con|gre&s;s. I have &s;een all that has appeared in the Ga|zettes, as having been &s;aid on this &s;ubject in the Hou&s;e, but have found nothing equally &s;atisfactory with this &s;hort di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I have made an extract from it, for the &s;ake of thinking men, who may wi&s;h to be &s;atisfied, as I have been, and may not have &s;een the Telegraphe. Let what will be thought of it at pre&s;ent, I will &s;take any reputation which it may be my ambition to po&s;&s;e&s;s as a literary man (and this, with that of moral ho|ne&s;ty, is the only ambition I ever had) that ultimately it will be con&s;idered, as having the <HI>weight of a de|ci&s;ion,</HI> and equal to an <HI>authority in law;</HI> not from the place from whence it was given, but from its own intrin&s;ic force of Argument.</P>
<P>Let it not be under&s;tood from this eulogy, that I at all involve my&s;elf in any opinion with regard to the original expediency of treating with Great-Britain; or the merits of the treaty concluded with that power; nor with regard to the que&s;tion, <HI>where ought the treaty making power to be lodged.</HI> For the di&s;&s;er|tation is wide of the&s;e &s;ubjects. I only declare my&s;elf to be one of tho&s;e who have believed that the acceptance of the Briti&s;h treaty by the Pre&s;ident and Senate gave it the validity of <HI>a con&s;titutional contract, and that the national faith is pledged to fulfil it.</HI> Having expre&s;&s;ed this opinion on public occa&s;ions in this country, it is na|tural for me to be plea&s;ed with &s;eeing that opinion &s;o in|controvertibly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and it is not to &s;upport the rea&s;oning that I give the voucher of my name; but to iu&s;tify my judgment that I publi&s;h the rea&s;oning.</P>

<HEAD>POSITION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the treaty with Britain has acquired the &s;anction of the American con&s;titution, and our national faith is pledged to the word, that it &s;hall be fairly carried into execution.</P>
<P N="2">2. That a refu&s;al of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, to exerci&s;e their powers for its execution, would exhibit to the world a &s;pecta|cle of a government at war with it&s;elf, one branch defeating the acts and purpo&s;es of another, the whole deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a &s;tate of real or approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am of opinion that the treaty with Britain, having been approved by two thirds of the Senate, and ratified by the Pre&s;ident, has acquired the &s;anction of the American con&s;titution, and, being &s;o accepted and ratified by the King of Bri|tain, our national faith is pledged to the world, that it &s;hall be fairly carried into execution.</P>
<P>My po&s;ition is, that a treaty approved by two thirds of the Senate, and ratified by the Pre&s;ident, and accepted by the other nation, has all the force of a law. As to &s;ome treaties, this is admitted: but it &s;eems to be contended that there are treaties which need a &s;ub&s;equent law to give them effect, and that where a treaty either oppo&s;es a former law or needs a &s;ub&s;equent law to give it effect, it is not valid, till, the former law be repealed, or the law to give it effect be enacted; and that it is di&s;creti|onary with the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to repeal or enact the laws nece&s;&s;ary for the effect of the treaty. The difference of opinion ari&s;es therefore out of the &s;ubject of the treaty. The con&s;titution is the te&s;t of the true opinion; and the que&s;tion here is, not what the con&s;titution ought to be, but what the con&s;titution is.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution declares, "that the Pre&s;ident of the United States &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators pre|&s;ent coucur;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ART. II. &sect; 2. ART. VI.</NOTE> and that all treaties made, or which
<PB N="6" REF="047694_0005_1024420FFB11E708">&s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land."</P>
<P>From the expre&s;&s;ion of "treaties made under the authority of the United States," it cannot be inferred, that there may be treaties to which the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives as well as of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, is nece&s;&s;ary. The true con&s;truction of the words will not ju&s;tify this inference. It was not intended to make all trea|ties the law of the land, but only treaties made under the authority of the United States. The Pre&s;ident is the agent of the United States for making treaties, his authority is theirs, and treaties made by him are made under the authority of the United States. As it was intended to declare treaties made under the confederation the law of the land, as well as treaties under the con&s;titution, it would have been ab&s;urd to have &s;aid treaties made by the Pre&s;ident, for this would not have applied to the pa&s;t treaties made by the former Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Neither do I think, that the authority given to Congre&s;s by the Con&s;titution "to regulate com|merce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and with the Indian tribes,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ART. I. &sect; 8.</NOTE> excludes, by implication, the authority of the Pre&s;ident to make comercial treaties, or renders the a&s;&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of a commercial treaty. The exclu&s;ion is not ex|pre&s;&s;ed, nor, as without it a plain u&s;e of the words appears, is it nece&s;&s;ary to be implied. The great defect of the confederation was that Congre&s;s had not authority to make laws for the regulation of trade binding on all the &s;tates in their foreign and mutual trade. This authority was in the &s;everal &s;tate legi&s;latures, and they would not agree to any uniform regulation. To &s;upply this defect, the con&s;titution gave Congre&s;s authority to regulate trade with foreign nations and among the &s;everal &s;tates; but it does not therefore follow that the Pre&s;ident could not al&s;o regulate trade with foreign nations by treaties. The end to be accompli&s;hed
<PB N="7" REF="047694_0006_10244211E433A3A0">was not an equality of each foreign nation but of each of the United States. A regulation made by the Pre&s;ident being uniform throughout the &s;tates as well accompli&s;hed the end in view, as any regu|lation made by Congre&s;s: and being by way of contract with a foreign nation, might be more ad|vantageous, by mutual conce&s;&s;ions. If regulations made by the Pre&s;ident could be more advantageous than regulations made by Congre&s;s; it is not to be inferred, that the authority of Congre&s;s to re|gulate excluded the authority of the Pre&s;ident to regulate. Nor did the authority of the Pre&s;ident to regulate, &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of an authority in Congre&s;s to regulate. For all nations might not be di&s;po&s;ed to treat. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to give Congre&s;s an authority to regulate by law which would be compul&s;ory on the foreign traders as well as on the &s;everal &s;tates. Thus, at all events, an uniform regulation would be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The regulation by treaty operates by the con&s;ent of the foreign nation. The regulation by law operates without con&s;ent. The one is a contract, the other a con&s;traint. The treaty may be more advantage|ous. The law &s;ecures, in every ca&s;e, uniformity throughout the &s;tates, though perhaps a le&s;s bene|ficial uniformity than that e&s;tabli&s;hed by treaty. It may therefore be proper, that both authorities &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and the expre&s;&s;ion of the one does not ex|clude the other. How &s;tands the ca&s;e then on the face of the con&s;titution. The Pre&s;ident has autho|rity to conclude treaties, treaties are laws; as the authority of the Pre&s;ident, to make commercial treaties, did not &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of an au|thority in Congre&s;s, to make commercial laws, which would operate on nations that would not treat, neither did this authority of Congre&s;s to make commercial laws, &s;uper&s;ede the authority of the Pre&s;ident to make commercial treaties, for they may be more advantageous by means of mu|tual conce&s;&s;ions. They are &s;eparate &s;ub&s;i&s;ting au|thories, each operating without the aid of the other.</P>
<P>If this be the plain meaning of the con&s;titution, it is not to be controverted by precedents from
<PB N="8" REF="047694_0007_1024421548A662D0">Britain, where there is no con&s;titution, but a col|lection of u&s;ages and incroachments; where the King is hereditary, his council is appointed by him|&s;elf, and removable at his plea&s;ure, and the parli|ament is at his devotion, and where there is no re&s;emblance to our Pre&s;ident, our Senate, and our Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>If there were any doubt, on the face of the con|&s;titution, that its meaning is as I have &s;tated, the &s;tatement made by the Pre&s;ident, in his an&s;wer to the demand for the papers mu&s;t intirely remove it. But as the di&s;clo&s;ure which he there makes, that the general convention had explicitly rejected the propo&s;ition, that "no treaty &s;hould be binding on the United States, which was not ratified by law," could not have dictated to us the terms of our pe|tition; it may be proper to enter into a more mi|nute detail of the hi&s;tory of this authority.</P>
<P>All governments have two relations, from each of which certain duties ari&s;e, a relation to their own citizens, and a relation to foreign nations.&mdash; The duties ari&s;ing out of the relation to their own citizens are pointed out by laws, enacted by the legi&s;lature, and carried into effect by the executive and the judiciary. The duties ari&s;ing out of the relation to foreign nations are pointed out by the general law of nations, and by the conventional law of nations, or treaties, which are &s;pecial laws binding tho&s;e nations which enter into them; and the declaration and execution of the&s;e duties are generally committed to the executive only or chiefly, as the proper organ of communication with foreign nations<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was probably on this principle, that di&s;trict courts of the United States refu&s;ed to examine prize cau&s;es. The &s;uperior court might perhaps have thought that the exerci&s;e of this authority by the judiciary would be le&s;s invidious to foreign nations: and, as judges were to decide on treaties, they might as well decide on the law of nations in all its parts.</NOTE> It is the duty of every na|tion to e&s;tabli&s;h in it an organ of communication
<PB N="9" REF="047694_0008_1024421947251A00">with other nations: and to the executive it is ge|nerally con&s;ided, to a&s;certain what is the law of nations, and to form treaties, which are &s;pecial laws of the treating nations, altering, enlarging, dimini&s;hing, or otherwi&s;e modifying, the general law of nations, with re&s;pect to the treating nations. The&s;e treaties create new rights and duties, of a po&s;itive nature, between the treating nations, the violation of which is a violation of a perfect right, and, therefore, an injury, and a cau&s;e of war.</P>
<P>Previous to the revolution, we had no relation to any foreign nation; we were colonies, provin|ces, or appendages to Britain, and we could form no treaty with any nation. The Congre&s;s, which met at Philadelphia in 1774, was a Congre&s;s of colonies. Each colony had one vote in Congre&s;s. Engaged in a common cau&s;e, and abandoning all hope of reunion with Britain, Congre&s;s, without any expre&s;s authority, but as the re&s;ult of the ge|neral tru&s;t, con&s;idered it&s;elf as a proper organ of a joint communication of all the colonies with fo|reign nations. Accordingly, after they had ap|pointed a committee for preparing a declaration of independence, they re&s;olved on the appoint|ment of a committee, to prepare a form of confe|deration, and a committee to prepare a plan of treaties to be propo&s;ed to foreign powers. In pur&s;uance of this, Congre&s;s propo&s;ed treaties with France and with Spain; and a treaty of alliance, and a treaty of amity and commerce between France and the United States of New-Hamp&s;hire, &amp;c. were concluded by their commi&s;&s;ioners at Pa|ris, in February 1778, and ratified by Congre&s;s in May 1778, before the ratification of the articles of confederation.</P>
<P>Though the declaration of independence put the&s;e colonies in a capacity of treating, by declar|ing them free and independent &s;tates; they were thirteen free and independent &s;tates; each of which, though all connected in a general cau&s;e, like the Swi&s;s Cantons, or the German Princes, might enter into a &s;eparate treaty with any foreign nation. The confederation gave no authority to
<PB N="10" REF="047694_0009_1024421D46CD7480">Congre&s;s to regulate trade. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, with all pow|ers not delegated, remained with the &s;everal &s;tates. But, though it declared, that each &s;tate retained its &s;overeignty and independence, it ordained, "that no &s;tate &s;hould, without the con&s;ent of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;end any em|ba&s;&s;y to, or receive any emba&s;&s;y from, or enter into conference or agreement, alliance or treaty with, any king, prince or &s;tate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ART. 6.</NOTE> and that the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled &s;hould have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right and power of entering into treaties and alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce &s;hould be made, whereby the legi&s;la|tive power of the re&s;pective &s;tates &s;hould be re|&s;trained from impo&s;ing &s;uch impo&s;ts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are &s;ubjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any &s;pecies of goods what&s;oever:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ART. 9.</NOTE> but they were to enter into no treaties or alliances, without the a&s;&s;ent of nine of the &s;tates."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">9.</NOTE> It was al&s;o or|dained, "that no &s;tate &s;hould lay any impo&s;ts or duties, which may interfere with any &s;tipulations in treaties entered into by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, with any king, prince or &s;tate, in pur&s;uance of any treaties already propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s, to the courts of France and Spain."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Before the confederation, Congre&s;s concluded their treaty of alliance, and treaty of amity and commerce with France, by virtue of their general implied authority, as proper organs of communi|cation with foreign nations.</P>
<P>Under the confederation, Congre&s;s concluded a treaty of amity and commerce with Holland, a treaty of peace with Britain, a treaty of amity and commerce with Sweden, a treaty of amity and commerce with Pru&s;&s;ia, a treaty of peace and friend&s;hip with the Emperor of Morocco, and &s;ix Indian treaties.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s concluded the&s;e treaties by virtue of the expre&s;s authority of the confederation, to en|ter into treaties on the a&s;&s;ent of nine of the &s;tates. This a&s;&s;ent of nine &s;tates was of nine &s;tates in Con|gre&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="047694_0010_1024421F6AB90AD0">a&s;&s;embled. For this was a Congre&s;s of &s;tates. Each &s;tate might have not le&s;s than two nor more than &s;even repre&s;entatives; but each &s;tate had but one vote. If all the repre&s;entatives of any &s;tate agreed in opinion, the votes of all made but one vote; if they differed in opinion, and were une|qually divided, the vote of the majority was the vote of the &s;tate; if they differed in opinion, and were equally divided, the &s;tate was confidered as not voting. So that if all the repre&s;entatives, or a majority of the repre&s;entatives, of each of nine &s;tates in Congre&s;s, a&s;&s;ented to atreaty, it was ratified.</P>
<P>The authority given to Congre&s;s by the confe|deration to enter into treaties included an authority to enter into commercial treaties; and, by com|mercial treaties, to re&s;train the &s;tate legi&s;latures otherwi&s;e there would have been no need for the provi&s;ion that no treaty of commerce &s;hould re|&s;train the &s;tate legi&s;latures from impo&s;ing &s;uch du|ties on foreigners as on their own people.</P>
<P>Though Congre&s;s had not authority to regulate trade by law, for this authority remained in the &s;tate legi&s;latures, it had authority to regulate trade by treaty, which, except in the excluded ca&s;e, re&s;trained the authority of regulating by law, and rendered void all contrary laws, except in the ca&s;e re&s;erved. The external relation was committed to the care of Congre&s;s, the internal to the &s;tate legi&s;latures. A treaty is a contract between two nations, and binds both, as a law which neither of them has authority to repeal without the a&s;&s;ent of the other. The confederation provided for the validity of the treaties entered into before; becau&s;e the &s;tates had not before given Congre&s;s any ex|pre&s;s authority to make treaties. But the confe|deration &s;ays nothing, as to treaties to be made under its authority, not &s;uppo&s;ing it nece&s;&s;ary to provide for their validity; becau&s;e the authority given to make treaties nece&s;&s;arily implied their obligation when made. No law of any &s;tate there|fore was nece&s;&s;ary for confirming a treaty: for a treaty made under the authority given by the con|federation was from its nature a law of all the &s;tates, and could not be made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="12" REF="047694_0011_10244221C8D24918">&s;uperaddition of any other nor could it be con|trouled by the law of any &s;tate; but was the &s;u|preme law of the land. This was a &s;ettled princi|ple, and wherever it did not operate in practice, it was not becau&s;e its authority could be denied, but from collateral cau&s;es. This is clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed by Mr. Jeffer&s;on in his admirable letter to Mr. Hammond.</P>
<P>So &s;tood the authority of treaties under the con|federation. The con&s;titution ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s the power, formerly retained by the &s;everal &s;tates, to regulate commerce; and in the Pre&s;ident by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, the power to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concur; and expre&s;sly declared all treaties, made and to be made, the &s;upreme law of the land. This arrangement &s;ub&s;tituted the legi&s;lature of the United States in place of the le|gi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, for the purpo&s;e of making laws to regulate trade; and the Pre&s;ident of the United States with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent, in place of nine of the thirteen &s;tates in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, for the purpo&s;e of making all treaties. The fir&s;t was charged with the internal, the la&s;t with the exter|nal relation. The effect or validity of treaties, when made, is only declared, it is not enlarged, And the declaration was probably made to remove all pretence of objection, which Britain could make to our inexecution of the treaty of 1783.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution gave to the Pre&s;ident, with two thirds of the Senate, the &s;ame power which the confederation gave to the whole Congre&s;s of mak|ing treaties, and more, for it does not annex the provi&s;ion, annexed by the confederation, that no treaty of commerce &s;hould re&s;train a &s;tate legi&s;la|ture, from impo&s;ing the &s;ame duties on foreigners, as on its own people. The power of Congre&s;s to make treaties was &s;ole and exclu&s;ive of the &s;tate legi&s;latures; the power of the Pre&s;ident and two thirds of the Senate is &s;ole and exclu&s;ive of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The power of Congre&s;s to make treaties, included a power to make com|mercial
<PB N="13" REF="047694_0012_10244225101B3AE0">treaties, notwith&s;tanding the power to re+gulate trade was not given to Congre&s;s, but re|mained in the &s;tate legi&s;latures; the power of the Pre&s;ident and two thirds of the Senate, to make treaties includes a power to make commercial trea|ties, notwith&s;tanding the power to regulate com|merce is ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s. Congre&s;s had power to make all treaties, &s;ubject to one exception, the Pre&s;ident and two thirds of the Senate have power to make all treaties, without any exception. The con&s;titution was framed as a &s;ub&s;titute for the con|federation, and its framers mu&s;t have had the con|federation in view; and as the confederation di&s;|tingui&s;hes commercial from other treaties, and the con&s;titution does not, it is evident that the framers of the con&s;titution meant no di&s;tinction; but gave to the Pre&s;ident and two thirds of the Senate, the power of making all treaties. Under the confede|ration, nine &s;tates made two thirds of the number of &s;tates then exi&s;ting in Congre&s;s. The framers of the con&s;titution for&s;aw an increa&s;e of the num|ber of &s;tates, when nine would not be two thirds; the con&s;titution therefore fixes the &s;ame proportion, without naming the number, and makes the concur|rence of two thirds of the Senate nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of a treaty.</P>
<P>Prejudices, habits, and local intere&s;ts, are not ea&s;ily &s;ubdued. Each of the &s;tates was a &s;overeign &s;tate, and all &s;overeigns are equal. Under the confederation therefore they all met with an equal voice in Congre&s;s. The large &s;tates had long complained of this, and claimed votes in proporti|on to the number of their citizens. The &s;mall &s;tates a&s;&s;erted their &s;overeignty, and con&s;equent equality, and con&s;idered this as entirely drowning their voice in Congre&s;s. On this principle, Virgi|nia alone would now have more votes than New-Hamp&s;hire, Vermont, Rhode-I&s;land, New Jer&s;ey, Delaware, Kentuckey and Georgia put for other; and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-York, Penn&s;ylvania and Virgina would have more votes, than all the other eleven &s;tates in the Union. It was not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, that the &s;mall &s;tates would agree to this;
<PB N="14" REF="047694_0013_1024422694E42118">and, in the Convention, the claims on both &s;ides were &s;o compromi&s;ed, that votes &s;hould be accord|ing to numbers in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and according to &s;tates in the Senate, in other words that each &s;tate &s;hould &s;end two Senators, and repre&s;entatives in proportion to its number; and that every member &s;hould have one vote. Thus each of the &s;mall &s;tates retained its equal voice in the Senate; and, as a further &s;acrifice to the &s;mall &s;tates, that branch alone in which they were all equal was permitted to concur in treaties. Thus the matter was put, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, on the footing on which it &s;tood, under the confeder|ation. Under the confederation, treaties were made with the concurrence of two thirds of the &s;tates in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled; each &s;tate had one vote and its delegates to Congre&s;s were cho&s;en by its own legi&s;tatures. Under the con&s;titution, treaties are made with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate; each &s;tate has two Senators, and they are cho&s;en by its own legi&s;lature. Under the con&s;ederation a law of a &s;tate could neither increa&s;e nor dimini&s;h the validity of a treaty. Under the con&s;titution, a law of Congre&s;s can neither encrea&s;e nor dimini&s;h the validity of a commercial treaty. A law is the act of one party only, a treaty is on mutual &s;tipulations with another.</P>
<P>Under the confederation, congre&s;s concluded ele|ven treaties, &s;ome of which were commercial trea|ties, &s;ome &s;ettled limits, &s;ome &s;tipulated for the payment of money, &s;ome defined pliacy &amp;c. Mu&s;t not the framers of the Con&s;titution have had the&s;e in their view: in examining the treaty pow|er of the confederation, mu&s;t they not have exa|mined the manner and objects of its exerci&s;e; and it they had meant that it &s;hould be abridged, un|der the con&s;titution would they not have done &s;o expre&s;sly? If they gave it generally, as it had been given by the confederation; mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e, that they meant it &s;hould be exerci&s;ed, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> had been under the con&s;ederation: and that they did not trean that the concurrence of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives was nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="15" REF="047694_0014_1024422ACBBD91C8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> convention explicitly rejected &s;uch concurrence.</P>
<P>When the con&s;titution, previous to its adopti|on, became a &s;ubject of public di&s;putation, its op|ponents attacked and its advocates defended, but all admitted this extent of power of the Pre&s;ident with two thirds of the Senate in making treaties.</P>
<P>When the &s;tate conventions met to ratify the con&s;titution, it was there con&s;idered with all this extent of power, and, in this &s;hape, was cen&s;ured, defended, and ratified. Some of the&s;e conventi|ons propo&s;ed amendments to it. The &s;eventh amendment propo&s;ed by the convention of Virginia is "That no commercial treaty &s;hall be ratified, without the concurrence of two thirds of the <HI>whole number</HI> of the members of the Senate; and no treaty, ceding, contracting, re&s;training or &s;u&s;pending the territorial rights or claims of the United States or any of them, or their, or any of their rights or claims to fi&s;hing in the American &s;eas, or navigating the American rivers, &s;hall be made but in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t urgent and extreme nece&s;&s;ity; nor &s;hall any &s;uch treaty be ratified, without the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both hou&s;es re&s;|pectively." The &s;eventh amendment propo&s;ed by the convention of North Carolina is in the &s;ame words. The twenty-third amendment propo&s;ed by that convention recommends, that no treaty, which &s;hall be directly oppo&s;ed to the exi&s;ting laws of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall be valid until &s;uch law &s;hall be repealed, or made conform|able to &s;uch treaty.</P>
<P>The&s;e amendments &s;hew that the conventions under&s;tood the effect of a treaty made by the Pre|&s;ident with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent, in its full extent; that they be|lieved, that unle&s;s the fir&s;t amendment was made, the Pre&s;ident, had power with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> to make a com|mercial treaty, or any other treaty, without the concurrence of any of the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, that every treaty &s;o made had the
<PB N="16" REF="047694_0015_1024422D79D82E88">force of a law, notwith&s;tanding any previous, exi&s;t|ing, contrary law. So far I think, they under&s;tood the Con&s;titution truly; and gave treaties no more force than with the exception of the ca&s;es re&s;erved, they had under the confederation. In pur&s;uance of the propo&s;itions of amendment, by &s;everal of the conventions, Congre&s;s afterwards recommend|ed &s;ome of them to the con&s;ideration of the &s;ever|al &s;tates; but neither of the amendments re&s;pect|ing treaties was among the number; and the con|&s;titution remains without tho&s;e amendments.</P>
<P>I could pur&s;ue this unvaried con&s;truction of the con&s;titution down to the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Con|gre&s;s; but I confider the con&s;titution it&s;elf, with tho&s;e previous and cotemporary elucidations, &s;o clear and deci&s;ive, that they who will not be per|&s;uaded by tho&s;e, would not be per&s;uaded though one ro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>By virtue of this con&s;titutional authority, the Pre&s;ident has concluded a con&s;ular convention with France, relative to commerce and navigation, various treaties with Indian nations, a treaty with Britain, a treaty with Algiers, and a treaty with Spain.</P>
<P>No law of any &s;tate was ever nece&s;&s;ary, for the validity of any treaty made under the confedera|tion; though the &s;tate legi&s;latures had then, as congre&s;s has now, the power to regulate trade with foreign nations And it would be difficult to point out any principle in the Briti&s;h treaty, which is not to be found in &s;ome, in &s;everal, or in each of the former and &s;ub&s;equent treaties. I therefore believe, that it, like them, has acquired the &s;anc|tion of the American con&s;titution.</P>
<P>To bring the preceding points into one view, I recapitulate. Every nation has an external and internal relation; and ought to provide conductors of both. Under our confederation, Congre&s;s was charged with external relation. Congre&s;s had not power to regulate trade by law; but it had pow|er to make treaties, and by treaties to regulate trade, and all treaties under their authority were laws without any aid of &s;tate laws; though the
<PB N="17" REF="047694_0016_10244230CA37B130">&s;tate legi&s;latures alone had power to regulate trade by law. Congre&s;s did make treaties to regulate trade. The con&s;titution charges the Pre&s;ident with the external relation, gives him authority, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, to make treaties. This, without limitation, mu&s;t mean all &s;uch treaties, as Congre&s;s, before had au|thority to make; and they had authority to make, and did make, commercial treaties. All treaties, made under the authority of the United States, are the &s;upreme law of the land. Nothing can add to the obligation of a law; for that would &s;ignify, that a law is not binding. Therefore, though Con|gre&s;s be charged with the internal relation to regu|late, not being exclu&s;ively charged with the regu|lation of trade, a commercial treaty needs no law of Congre&s;s, to make it binding on the nation. Every agent, who exceeds not his authority, binds his principal. The Pre&s;ident is the agent of the nations for making all treaties, commercial trea|ties included, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate; other nations treat with him, as out agent, in confidence of this; and the faith of the United States is pledged to the world, that all treaties &s;o made by him, under their authority, &s;hall be fairly carried into execution.</P>
<P>The principle contended for, that a law may be nece&s;&s;ary to give relidity to a treaty, and the prin|ciple rejected by the convention, that a treaty be not binding till it be ratified by law, are preci&s;ely the &s;ame. If it be admitted, that the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives claim no agency in making, it mu&s;t be admitted, that a treaty is made, when, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, it is ratified by the Pre&s;ident; and if a treaty made be a law; what can be added to its validity? Can it be made more than a law?&mdash;No law can add to the validity of a treaty made under the authority of the United States, for the con&s;titution declares it the &s;upreme law of the land.</P>
<P>That a law may be nece&s;&s;ary, as, in the ca&s;e of the Briti&s;h treaty, a law is nece&s;&s;ary, to carry a treaty into execution, is a principle altogether
<PB N="18" REF="047694_0017_102442325659FC20">different, and proceeds from a part of the con&s;titu|tion not at all connected with treaties, and equally applicable to the execution of every act of Con|gre&s;s, which requires money for its execution. It is declared by the con&s;titution, that no money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury, but in con&s;e|quence of appropriations made by law. A law making an appropriation of money for this pur|po&s;e, is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining the mo|ney, and obtaining the money is nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of the treaty.</P>
<P>A treaty is a contract between two nations, by which both are bound, and every branch and indi|vidual of both. Like every other contract, its execution is the end in view on either &s;ide. If this be not accompli&s;hed, the end of the contract is de|feated, the contract is broken. The contract e&s;ta|bli&s;hes po&s;itive rights and duties, on either &s;ide, which neither is at liberty to fru&s;trate or evade. A law, in which none but the nation it&s;elf is con|cerned, may be repealed or neglected, at the plea|&s;ure of the nation. But a treaty is a law in which two nations are concerned, and a breach or inex|ecution of it is a violation of a po&s;itive right, and a ju&s;t cau&s;e of war, if the other party choo&s;e to make it &s;o. A treaty made under the authority of the United States engages the faith of the United States to a foreign nation, that every branch or individual of our government &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t in carry|ing it into execution; and a breach of this engage|ment is a breach of national faith, and a &s;tain on national honour. The Pre&s;ident is the agent of the United States for making this engagement, he acts under their authority, a treaty made by him, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate, is a treaty made under the authority of the United States, and a law of the United States, in which the intere&s;ts of another nation are concerned, and which therefore no branch of the government of the United States is ju&s;tifiable in refu&s;ing its au|thority to execute, unle&s;s it can be ju&s;tifiable in violating the po&s;itive right of another nation, and giving ju&s;t cau&s;e of war. The only di&s;cretion,
<PB N="19" REF="047694_0018_10244235CCC86E30">therefore, that I can perceive, in any branch of this government, in refu&s;ing appropriations for the execution of a valid treaty, is a di&s;cretion of doing inju&s;tice and injury. The people, by their con|&s;titution, have made the Pre&s;ident their agent for the purpo&s;e of making treaties. Whether in any treaty, he makes the be&s;t bargain for them they have &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the Senate only, to enquire If two thinds of the Senate concur, that he has, and approve the treaty, and he ratifies it; it has the &s;anction of the American con&s;titution, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives are bound by na|tional ju&s;tice, and national faith, to concur, if nece&s;&s;ary, in carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the treaty to be valid, that is, I &s;up|po&s;e, the Pre&s;ident in making it, has not exceeded the authority given to him, by the United States. Ours is a government of departments, or branches, the authority of each of which is pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution; if any branch exceed its authority, its act is void; if it exceed not its authority, its act, though not &s;o good as it might be, is binding; for the people, by their con&s;titution, gave this autho|rity to its di&s;cretion. To the di&s;cretion of the Pre|&s;ident, with the check only of two thirds of the Senate, the people of the United States has &s;ub|mitted the authority of making treaties. Whether in making a treaty, he has made as good a bargain as the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives could have made, the con&s;titution permits them not to enquire; but only whether he has exceeded his authority. Be|&s;ides the con&s;titutional limits, the Pre&s;ident, in the exerci&s;e of his authority in making treaties, is like every other national agent for this purpo&s;e, bound by what may be called the <HI>common</HI> law of nations on this point. There is a &s;upreme law, the &s;afety of the nation, which no treaty agent can violate; and in all nations, without any written con&s;titution, a treaty endangering the exi&s;tence and &s;afety of the nation is void; and the nation to be injured by it, may, without any breach of the law of nations, explain this danger to the other nation, and decline the execution of the treaty. Shylock's bargain
<PB N="20" REF="047694_0019_102442381234B888">with the merchant of Venice was clearly void. I conceive therefore that, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, in their deliberations on the expediency of carrying the Briti&s;h treaty into effect, can enquire only whether the Pre&s;ident has exceeded his con|&s;titutional, or general authority to make treaties; if he has not, it has acquired the &s;anction of the American con&s;titution, and they are bound by it, while this con&s;titution &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Whether the A|merican people are di&s;&s;atisfied with this part of their con&s;titution, and de&s;ire a change in it, cannot come into view on this que&s;tion, but may after|wards be a&s;certained, in a regular and con&s;tituti|onal way.</P>
<P N="2">2. I conceive al&s;o, that a refu&s;al of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, to exerci&s;e their powers for the execution of the Briti&s;h trea|ty, would exhibit to the world, the &s;pectacle of a government at war with it&s;elf, one branch defeat|ing the acts and purpo&s;es of another, the whole deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a &s;tate of real or approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the treaty, appearing to have been con&s;titutionally concluded, and to be advan|tageous to this nation, is the &s;upreme law; that this being a government of branches, each branch is bound to exerci&s;e its authority for the execution of laws; and this being a law to which another nation is a party, all the branches of government are bound by it.</P>
<P>There is a department of external, and a depart|ment of internal relations. The departments are not e&s;tabli&s;hed to ob&s;truct each other in the exer|ci&s;e of their con&s;titutional authority, but to check the u&s;urpation of unlawful power by any. While one department exerci&s;es its own di&s;cretion within its con&s;titutional limits it is not di&s;cretionary with any other, whether it will exert its con&s;titutional authority to give effect to the acts of the fir&s;t; un|le&s;s it be di&s;cretionary to &s;top the operations of the government, and defeat the provi&s;ions of the con|&s;titution. Each department, called on to decide on the complete acts of another, may examine its
<PB N="21" REF="047694_0020_1024423B9F9645F0">authority, not its di&s;cretion. Where there is au|thority, mutual co-operation, not mutual ob&s;truc|tion, becomes the duty. When a law is complete|ly made, every branch of government, who&s;e au|thority is nece&s;&s;ary for its execution, is bound to interpo&s;e its authority for its execution, while it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Suppo&s;e in&s;tead of a Briti&s;h, this had been a French treaty, as much applauded, as this has been cen&s;ured; and having been, with great dif|ficulty, approved in the Senate, by twenty votes again&s;t ten, it had received the Pre&s;ident's ratifica|tion, and nothing remained, but an appropriating law, for its complete operation. But before this law pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ix of the twenty went out, and &s;ix new Senators &s;ucceeded, who all hated the treaty, and were determined to defeat it. Here now the twenty &s;ink to fourteen, and the ten ri&s;e to &s;ixteen. An appropriating bill comes up from the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, which had pa&s;&s;ed there unani|mou&s;ly. The Senate reject it. In my opinion, the rejection by the Senate would be contrary to duty, and the principles of our government. I think their di&s;cretion expired, when they concur|red in the treaty: and as to appropriation, I think it a thing of cour&s;e, an act of po&s;itive duty, and the refu&s;al a violation of con&s;titutional principles. To give a power to defeat, is in fact requiring an a&s;&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h. Refu&s;ing appropriation is a power to defeat. And to &s;ay that it is di&s;cretionary with the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, by refu&s;ing an appropriation, to defeat the execution of a treaty, is to &s;ay, that they have, what the con&s;ti|tution has refu&s;ed them, an authority to confirm or reject a treaty. Any branch the exerci&s;e of who&s;e di&s;cretion is nece&s;&s;ary to make a law, may u&s;e its di&s;cretion, in either making or rejecting it. But when a law is made, no branch, who&s;e inter|po&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary for its execution, has any di&s;|cretion in refu&s;ing its interpo&s;ition. A valid treaty is made without any interpo&s;ition of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. A valid treaty is a law. Ap|propriation is its execution. Appropriation can|not be made without the interpo&s;ition of the Hou&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="047694_0021_1024423DF3227440">of Repre&s;entatives. It therefore becomes an act of duty in them, to make the appropriation, and they have no di&s;cretion to re&s;u&s;e it; unle&s;s they have a di&s;cretion to refu&s;e to perform a po&s;itive duty. The refu&s;al exhibits a government at war with it|&s;elf. Infult to one branch might provoke retalia|tion. The genuine dictates of the con&s;titution would be di&s;regarded by all; one branch would defeat the acts of another; and the government would be deprived of all energy and exertion, and in a &s;tate of real or approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The judiciary department has authority to &s;ay, whether a law is con&s;titutional or not but if con|&s;titutional, they cannot refu&s;e to execute it, how|ever &s;trong their conviction may be, that it is inex|pedient. On this point they have no di&s;cretion: that lay with the legi&s;lature. If they &s;hould a&s;&s;ume this power, and have influence to &s;upport it, the judiciary would &s;wallow up the other departments, and the government would be di&s;&s;olved. I think the ca&s;es preci&s;ely &s;imilar.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a treaty, &s;uppo&s;e an act of the legi&s;la|ture, for the execution of which an appropriation is nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;e&s;&s;ion in which this law is made expires, and a new Hou&s;e or Repre&s;entatives is elected, who do not approve the law. The Se|nate &s;ends down an appropriation bill, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives reject it; the law cannot be executed, it is, in fact, repealed. But, by the con&s;titution, a law cannot be repealed but by the con&s;ent of both branches of the legitlature; here then is a violation, in fact, of the con&s;titution. The con&s;titution requires a Pre&s;ident of the United States, and a Supreme Court; &s;uppo&s;e either branch of the legi&s;lature to think tho&s;e or all the other officers of government unnecce&s;&s;ary. How &s;hall they get rid of them. They cannot alter the con&s;titution; they cannot repeal the law e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the offices without the con&s;ent of the other branch. But they can do it, in an incidental way, by refu&s;ing an appropriation. If there be no ap|propriation, no &s;alary can be drawn from the trea|&s;ury; if no &s;alary, there will be no officers, or on|ly
<PB N="23" REF="047694_0022_10244240D1797ED8">the creatures of the refu&s;ing branch; thus the refu&s;ing branch will &s;tand alone in the government, &s;wallow up all power, and the government will be di&s;&s;olved. The &s;ame thing may be done, by making appropriations &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to af|ford only &s;alaries, which none but their creatures will accept.</P>
<P>Our government may be called a government of checks; but the&s;e are not checks, but death and di&s;&s;olution. If a valid treaty has been made, by the Pre&s;ident and Senate, it mu&s;t either be altered by them, with the con&s;ent of the other nation; or the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives are bound by the con&s;titution to make the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations. If a law has been made, any branch afterwards, di&s;approving it, mu&s;t come forward directly, with a propo&s;al of repeal, and if not, or if they fail in repealing it, they are bound to make the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations. They have no di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Though I can ea&s;ily &s;ee a variety of difficulties, in any other con&s;titutional di&s;po&s;ition of the power of making treaties, or in a ju&s;t limitation of their objects; yet I confe&s;s, a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, that the &s;ubjects of this treaty authority are not &s;uffici|ently defined by the con&s;titution; and perhaps the con&s;titution may admit amendment in this re&s;pect. But, at pre&s;ent, it appears to me clear. And no political evil is to be more deprecated, than any one branch of the government making the con&s;ti|tution different in practice, from what it really is. This is altering the con&s;titution, at their plea&s;ure, and, in fact, making it a piece of blank paper. If the con&s;titution is to be altered, let it be done by the whole nation in a con&s;titutional way. But if u&s;urpations begin, they will end only with the di&s;&s;olution of our government. Doubtful u&s;urpa|tions will produce plain u&s;urpations; till all checks are removea, and the con&s;titution pro&s;trat|ed before one branch. Of all u&s;urpations, tho&s;e are mo&s;t to be dreaded, which are made by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. That branch is numer|ous, &s;pread through all parts of the nation, and with the popularity and impo&s;ing name of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="24" REF="047694_0023_102442432E685B18" MS="y">repre&s;entatives of the people. their u&s;ur|pations of power are approved, as advanced of liberty; what is acquared by them, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be gaihed by the people, till, by degrees, they have &s;tript the other branches of all their authori|ty, and &s;tanding alone amid&s;t the wreck of the con&s;titution, they are a&s;&s;ailed by the pa&s;&s;ion or mi&s;led by the demagogue, of the day; the guil|lotine falls on the head of any victim of their un|re&s;trained re&s;entment, and confiacation gra&s;ps the propert of any object of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h con&s;titution has been appealed to. What is the Briti&s;h con&s;titution? Whatever the Hou&s;e of Commons choo&s;es to make it. The King is but the pageant of &s;tate. The principle, that the King is not an&s;werable for any of his conduct, &s;hows that he has no real authority, and that the mini&s;ter alone has all the power. In fact the mi|ni&s;ter is king. The mini&s;ter mu&s;t be the favourite or the ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e of Commons. He mu&s;t he able either to plea&s;e or to command them.&mdash;Whenever he becomies the object of their contempt, re&s;entment, or indifference he mu&s;t retire from office. Neither the King, nor the Hou&s;e of Lords, can &s;helter him from their attacks, or &s;upport him in office. When a mini&s;ter is driven out, we may &s;ay the King is dethroned; and every change of a mini&s;ter, we may call a new reign. And if the King had no more influence on the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, than what he derives from the con&s;titution, he would &s;oon &s;ink under their weight, his head would be brought to the block, and his office aboli&s;hed; the Hou&s;e of Lords would become in|&s;ignificant, and cea&s;e with him; and all power would be ve&s;ted in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>And we too, if we do not protect each branch of our government, in its ju&s;t authority, will &s;oon &s;ee them &s;ink under one, and it rai&s;ed into a po|pular tyranny, whirled about with every &s;torm, and bearing de&s;truction in its cour&s;e.</P>
