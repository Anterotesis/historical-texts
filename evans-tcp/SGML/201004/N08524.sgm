<HEAD>The following SERMON was delivered at the Fryers Meeting in Bri&s;tol, on Friday, the <HI>22d</HI> Day of May, <HI>1767.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently thought, and the &s;enti|ment hath been confirmed from my own ob&s;er|vation and experience, that a great and excel|lent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no &s;urer guide than tradition, &s;ub&s;cribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, re|corded in holy writ;
<Q>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lviii. 11.</NOTE> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the Earth;"</Q></P>
<P>As &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, from whatever ground it ari&s;es, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to pur&s;ue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a &s;tep to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only &s;ure guide to true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>INDEED I &s;carce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exi&s;tence of the &s;upreme. Being; but believe, on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour, enlightened to &s;ee their duty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;|charge it; do, in con&s;equence of the&s;e favours, contemplate, with &s;atisfaction inexpre&s;&s;ible, the&s;e attributes of the mo&s;t high GOD, here mentioned by the P&s;almi&s;t: And could I be induced to think,
<PB N="4" REF="010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0">
that any part of mankind had &s;werved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of tho&s;e his attributes, as relative to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I &s;ay, could I believe their minds were de&s;titute of this animating and enlivening pro&s;pect of his power, omni&s;cience, and goodne&s;s, in his &s;uperintendant care, and pre&s;ent judging the earth, I &s;hould deem &s;uch but a very little removed, if any, from the &s;tate of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> upon who&s;e altars the holy apo&s;tle di&s;covered an in&s;cription,
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 23.</NOTE> "To the unknown God."</Q>
Indeed a language that was &s;poken formerly, hath been too much adopted by &s;ucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like tho&s;e men of Jeru&s;alem, who &s;aid, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zeh. i. 12.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> Many (&s;educed by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to e|&s;trange and withdraw them&s;elves from the arbitra|tor of the whole earth: They have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus rea&s;oned with them&s;elves, <Q>He will do us no good, why therefore &s;hould we &s;eek him? He will do us no harm, why &s;hould we fear him?</Q> This we may ju&s;tly look upon as the mo&s;t un|happy &s;eduction of mind! as it mi&s;leads to the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tance (without timely recovery) from that &s;tate of obedience, in which we are only capable of happine&s;s, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>BUT we may ju&s;tly conclude, that &s;uch impiety pa&s;t not the attention of an
all-&s;eeing GOD, in as much as he replied,
<Q>I will puni&s;h tho&s;e men of
<PB N="5" REF="010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0">
Jeru&s;alem, who have &s;aid, The Lord doth us no good, why &s;hould we &s;eek him? He will not do us any harm, why &s;hould we fear him?</Q></P>
<P>THE certainty of his &s;uperintendency, hath con|tinued to be the happine&s;s of all the wi&s;e and good in all ages; and it is the&s;e, and only the&s;e, that di&s;cern wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. Hence hath it become, and &s;till remains, an e&s;tabli&s;hed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</P>
<P>UNDER this head in particular, a Petition or Prayer that was put up to him who hath created the earth, and a&s;&s;igned a reward to the righteous, by <HI>Agur,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Jaketh,</HI> hath appeared to my mind, as nece&s;&s;ary at this day to be adopted by every individual, who is de&s;irous of living to the be&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, and happie&s;t purpo&s;e of life; without which they had better never have lived: And I cannot but recommend it mo&s;t particularly to <HI>You,</HI> the ri&s;ing generation, who&s;e minds I tru&s;t are at times &s;u&s;ceptible of proper impre&s;&s;ions, who are not become &s;laves to the vanity and lu&s;ts of the world: And indeed it &s;eems like the language of one that is entring upon the &s;tage of life: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not be|fore I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay, Who is the Lord? Or le&s;t I be poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of my God in vain!</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of this memorable requi&s;ition hath appeared to my mind, during the cour&s;e of a long &s;eries of ob&s;ervations of men, and times, with
<PB N="6" REF="010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0">
regard to its import in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of GOD; as including indeed, all that is good and nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;afe conduct and &s;upport through this life, to that completion of happine&s;s, propo&s;ed as the final reward of the righteous.</P>
<P>BUT how will &s;ome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no tru&s;t? Who would gladly be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and are much better plea&s;ed with, &s;haring a crown of wicked pro&s;peri|ty in this world, than with the pro&s;pect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a &s;tate of endle&s;s futurity.</P>
<P>O THAT parents would timely and vigilantly exert them&s;elves to rai&s;e early impre&s;&s;ions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the chri&s;tian doctrine, with all its glori|ous con&s;equences; firmly per&s;uading and convin|cing them, that they are under the immediate no|tice of that Being, who is ever un&s;peakably good and gracious; and informing them, that he is cloathed with every awful, reverential attribute; as being perfectly wi&s;e, powerful and good, yet &s;trictly ju&s;t; that he is the maker of us all; and that he delights to be called upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellation of, "Our father, who art in heaven."</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, under the deep and reverent &s;en&s;e of the certainty of his continual pre&s;ence and providence, let us be ever careful, ever earne&s;tly de&s;irous to con&s;titute a part of his children and fa|mily, in this our probationary &s;tate; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of &s;pirits, we may a&s;&s;uredly hope to join the cheru|bim
<PB N="7" REF="010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0">
and &s;eraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his mi|litant church; and may, when our warfare &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, unite with the chorus of his tri|umphant ho&s;ts, in the language and tribute of grateful adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>AND indeed without this ble&s;&s;ed hope, we are of all creatures the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable! being daily &s;urrounded with lamentation and woe! combating with &s;ecret or obvious di&s;tre&s;&s;es! and encountring, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and variety of afflictions! we might therefore tru|ly &s;ay, if our hopes were only fixed upon the tran|&s;itory and fleeting plea&s;ures of this life, we &s;hould be, of all the animal creation, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable! But we are a&s;&s;ured, that nothing le&s;s than GOD him&s;elf, is the infinite and endle&s;s reward of all that diligently and con&s;tantly &s;olicit him to the fol|lowing purpo&s;e.&mdash;<HI>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die; remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, le&s;t I be full, and deny thee, and &s;ay, who is the Lord? Or lo&s;t I be poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of my God in vain!</HI></P>
<P>WHICH is as if the Prophet had &s;aid,
<Q>Thou art my father, the author of my being; I made nothing my&s;elf, but am wholly and entirely the offspring of thy power, and workman&s;hip of thy hands: Thou knowe&s;t therefore what is be&s;t and fitte&s;t for me; and what can I require el&s;e from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy pre|&s;ervation out of the dangers of tho&s;e oppo&s;ite ex|tremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of
<PB N="8" REF="010899_0005_0F851BE18C44A000">
&s;afety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy approbation and favour in my walking therein.</Q></P>
<P>HIS mind was doubtle&s;s deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the awfulne&s;s and e&s;&s;ential &s;ubject of his petition; and <HI>the removing far from him vanity and lies,</HI> &s;eems to con&s;titute a very con&s;iderable part of it. But too many of us, deviating from this one mo&s;t im|portant point, are daily inclined to wander in the broad path of vanity and folly, and prone to mi|&s;take it for the path of peace; till oftentimes the &s;troke of adver&s;ity, of pain of body, or affliction of mind, convinceth <HI>in part,</HI> and, if unreformed, that of <HI>Death</HI> may <HI>fully</HI> convince us, when too late! of this mo&s;t fatal mi&s;take.</P>
<P>THE Prophet &s;aw into the propriety of that frame of mind, which utters the language dictated by divine wi&s;dom: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own under&s;tanding:</HI> In as much as his gracious &s;uperintendency, and merci|ful notice of his creatures, is &s;uch as even <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlv. 22.</NOTE> <HI>taketh in the ends of the earth;</HI> and daily affordeth us the cleare&s;t manife&s;tation of his goodne&s;s here, as it hath evidently pointed out to us that glorious path which leads to &s;afety and eternal peace. But <HI>vanity and lies</HI> have too frequently e&s;tranged the mind, drawn it off from heavenly objects and heavenly cares, and fixed its attention upon things wholly unworthy the notice of an immortal &s;pirit. Under the &s;educing influence of <HI>vanity and lies,</HI> men have been frequently led to pur&s;ue many things agreeable to their own wi&s;hes and imagined intere&s;ts, without the lea&s;t regard paid to ju&s;tice and equity.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010899_0005_0F851BE18C44A000">I MAY po&s;&s;ibly ob&s;erve an explanation and di|&s;tinction of the two &s;tates as I go on, which <HI>Agur</HI> &s;eems to refer to, viz. <HI>The di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery of the poor,</HI> on the one hand; and the <HI>vanity and pride of heart,</HI> too frequently con&s;picuous in the rich, on the other.</P>
<P>WERE the lives of men de&s;igned to be wholly alienated from a &s;tate of ju&s;tice and virtue, and entirely in&s;tructed and fixed in the maxims and manners of this world, &s;ingly to be taught to con|&s;ider it as the chief end of their exi&s;tence, there would then be &s;ome excu&s;e for u&s;ing every &s;pecies of art in joining <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. v. 8.</NOTE> <HI>hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and laying field to field, till there be no place, that they may be &s;eated as it were alone in the mid&s;t of the earth:</HI> But now, as the great de&s;ign of him who judgeth the earth, and rewardeth the righteous, hath been abundantly manife&s;ted and denounced to &s;uch as thus counter|act it, they who are intru&s;ted with riches, will ap|pear the more inexcu&s;able for their unbounded avarice, and can have nothing to plead in favour of their violation of his plain and clear intentions re&s;pecting mankind. It will all at la&s;t be found <HI>vanity and lies,</HI> without virtue; without a faithful dedication of their hearts to the revealed will of GOD. It is an ob&s;ervation of the preacher, that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ii. 26.</NOTE> <HI>God giveth to man that is good in his &s;ight wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and joy&mdash;but to the &s;inner he giveth travel; to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.</HI> And though he who is too unmindful of his Creator, may have erected edifices that appear to the eye of the &s;pectator as if they would &s;tand for ages, and may <HI>call them by his

own name;</HI> yet even in this view, without virtue, he is, in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Agur,</HI> a liar to him&s;elf: He thinks he hath &s;ecured happine&s;s, who&s;e the frame of his mind is the rever&s;e of it; fixt probably in a &s;tate of exclu&s;ion, from what may be ju&s;tly deemed true and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s; or any acqui&s;ition, which will be acceptable and well-plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD. In this circum&s;tance therefore he is a liar. The by-&s;tander indeed, who &s;ees him in the free enjoyment of affluence, and taking his ea&s;e, in appearance, in the fulne&s;s of his heart, may be ready to conclude &s;uch a one happy, by being unacquainted with his &s;ecret griefs; whereas many of his moments, if their true &s;tate could be penetrated into, would appear like tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ones of the king of I&s;rael; who, when he was &s;eat|ed in the height of his &s;plendor, magnificence, and royalty, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xxi. 27.</NOTE> <HI>rent his clothes, put on &s;ackcloth, fa&s;ted, and lay in &s;ackcloth, and went &s;oftly.</HI></P>

<P>I AM fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth &s;carce ever clo&s;ed, till death clo&s;es it; could they be induced to yield &s;ome of their precious moments to timely and &s;erious reflection; would endeavour to withdraw them&s;elves from tran&s;itory things, at lea&s;t before their la&s;t moments of life; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</P>
<P>THEY would now and then retire, for a &s;hort &s;pace at lea&s;t, from the world, before they entirely left it; frequently &s;it down, and &s;eriou&s;ly turn their view towards another world, another &s;tate of being, into which they can never hope to carry wealth, or honours; toward that approaching dread tribunal of righteou&s;ne&s;s, where the&s;e will gain no favour.</P>
<P>WHEN we take a &s;urvey of the world, and look back through the generations that are pa&s;t, we &s;ee that the love of vanity, wealth and grandeur, hath proved, from time to time, the <HI>ruin</HI> even of the faire&s;t <HI>empires</HI> and <HI>monarchies,</HI> which have been ever erected on the face of the earth: <HI>One refor|mation</HI> after another, and <HI>one &s;tate</HI> after another,
<PB N="15" REF="010899_0008_0F851BE3670BBE28">
have been de&s;troyed, from the <HI>pride and di&s;&s;ipation</HI> inherent in the minds of <HI>governors</HI> and <HI>teachers.</HI></P>
<P>HOW ought this con&s;ideration to humble the hearts, and redouble the vigilance of &s;uch as are placed in <HI>exalted &s;tations!</HI></P>
<P>I HOPE and tru&s;t our love, as a people in gene|ral, hath not been confined peculiarly to our&s;elves; but extended, as it ought to be, to all our fellow-creatures; to relieve poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, according to our abilities; to prevent and reclaim from the infinite danger and harms of impiety, and to en|courage every kind of real virtue.</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;ome families may have turned a&s;ide into the &s;tate of the world, and become engro&s;&s;ed with the love of its plea&s;ures and enjoyments; yet many others, I hope, and believe, have denied them&s;elves; have <HI>laid hold of the good word of life;</HI> and under its influence, pur&s;ued <HI>the one thing need|ful.</HI> Though &s;ome have declined, and even refu|&s;ed, the &s;ubjection due to their maker, as if they had a&s;ked with in&s;olence,
<Q>Who is this LORD, that he &s;hould reign over our hearts?</Q>
and had added,
<Q>We know no power equal to that of get|ting wealth, and honours;</Q>
&mdash;yet others have not departed from the obligations of fear and love; but have made proper reflections, paid ju&s;t re&s;pect to the great author of their being; and manife&s;ted it by a &s;teady watchfulne&s;s in conduct, which I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire, may become the happy ca&s;e of every one of my fellow creatures.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion is an important le&s;|&s;on of in&s;truction to us all! The departure of the di&s;embodied &s;oul from this world to another;
<PB N="16" REF="010899_0009_0F851BE42A9AFB80">
which methinks &s;hould entirely prevent our &s;etting too great a value upon all temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes been pre&s;ent in a dying hour; I have been pre&s;ent at a &s;cene of humbling di&s;tre&s;s; I have &s;een in &s;ome, the clo&s;ing period of a regular life of virtue; yet &s;uch a life, as on account of out|ward poverty, had been de&s;pi&s;ed and over looked &mdash;a whole life &s;pent, in which its happie&s;t mo|ments would have pa&s;t for mi&s;erable, in the minds of thou&s;ands: Yet when they have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e, they have experienced triumphant joy, in the ble&s;&s;ed hope and a&s;&s;urance of eternal life! through the merits of their <HI>dear Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE al&s;o beheld, on the other hand, the ha|bitations of &s;plendour exhibit a mournful &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, far different from the former! Then, when the &s;olemn approach of death hath begun to appear, attended with all its tremblings and fear|ful apprehen&s;ions of an after &s;tate! when the &s;oul, agonizing in its pains, hath viewed things in a far different light to what it had before done, when even the riches, in which it had long tru&s;ted, fell &s;hort of giving the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction: No hope of future happine&s;s afforded to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or! but, on the contrary, a gloomy pro&s;pect of de&s;pair; of an eternal &s;tate of mi&s;ery! of this have I been made a &s;orrowful witne&s;s, that &s;ome have gone out of the world, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. ii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>without God; without hope;</HI> with|out one comfortable reflection from the &s;acred ran&s;om of a <HI>dying Saviour!</HI></P>
<P>IN vain have they ardently wi&s;hed, in an ex|piring hour, that they might have been permitted to lengthen out their alotment of life a little
<PB N="17" REF="010899_0009_0F851BE42A9AFB80">
longer; that they might have but a &s;hort &s;pace of added time afforded them, for the important pur|po&s;e of repentance, and amendment of life; for <HI>feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked,</HI> and <HI>vi&s;iting the &s;ick;</HI> virtues, to which they had no pretence, in any of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and which then it pro|ved too late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to attain, however nece&s;&s;ary, for their &s;tanding approved at the ju&s;t judgment, to which they were approaching.</P>
<P>MAY we all therefore learn in&s;truction, from examples like the&s;e; and derive &s;uch advantage from this pre&s;ent &s;olemnity; &s;eeking and embracing <HI>the good word of life;</HI> and ever &s;tedfa&s;tly adhering to it, &s;o long as we continue in mutability.</P>
<P>MAY we never withdraw our&s;elves from watch|ful attention, to the guidance of divine providence; never indulge our&s;elves in arrogance, or tru&s;t too much to the rectitude of our own hearts; but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 17.</NOTE> <HI>pray without cea&s;ing,</HI> that we may be enabled to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. iii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>do works meet for repentance;</HI> and thereby attain an eternal inheritance in the kingdom of GOD!</P>

that thou may ever continue to guide and direct us! that &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of thy unmerited mercies may be to us, as often heretofore it hath been, an enlivening comfort, and a &s;trong &s;upport in the day of trouble: And we be&s;eech thee, O ble&s;&s;ed Father! to remember all in the like &s;ituation: Send forth <HI>thy light and thy truth</HI> even among&s;t tho&s;e who have never known, or have long for|gotten thee. We pray thee, draw them into thy holy hou&s;e; plant them in thine inclo&s;ed, for ever beautiful and mo&s;t excellent garden! their hearts becoming hereby powerfully inclined to attend, with a fixed and unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to the &s;alu|tary di&s;cipline of thine omnipre&s;ent, and unerring wi&s;dom!</P>
<P>IF thou &s;ee any ca&s;t upon the bed of langui&s;h|ing, do thou be plea&s;ed, we humbly pray thee, to afford them the vi&s;itation of thy love: Let thy divine con&s;olation be their continual attendant, whereby they may be indued with perfect re&s;igna|tion to thy ble&s;&s;ed will!</P>
<P>O THOU! that ha&s;t poured into our hearts, the fre&s;h and reviving &s;en&s;e of thy unbounded love; accept, we be&s;eech thee, our prayers for our own pre&s;ervation, and the lifting up of our hands for one another, for the gathering together of many to thy&s;elf; who art, and ha&s;t been the re&s;torer of many that have been <HI>&s;cattered abroad,</HI> that have <HI>gone a&s;tray,</HI> being &s;educed by various temptations, from thy <HI>&s;acred truth.</HI></P>
<P>FOR thy great name's &s;ake, for thy dear Son's &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of thy glorious cau&s;e of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s! we pray thee, remember the offspring
