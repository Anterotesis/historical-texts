<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is a reproach, too often ju&s;tly, ca&s;t on writers of morality, that their names prefixed in the title-pages of their books, are little el&s;e than a confutation of the pre|cepts that follow.</P>
<P>For as the morals of a divine, add no little weight to the doctrine he would incul|cate from the pulpit; &s;o the life of a writer equally dimini&s;hes, or adds to, the regard the public pay his works.</P>
<P>It is for this rea&s;on, as I &s;hould be &s;orry &s;entiments, who&s;e truth and importance I am &s;o fully convinced of, &s;hould meet with le&s;s regard from a knowledge of their author, that this little piece comes into the world without a name, which on other occa&s;ions has been made &s;o public.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible of the curio&s;ity naturally ari&s;ing in every reader, the de&s;ire of know|ing who, and what is the author: but for the above mentioned rea&s;on, not to &s;ay there is a rudene&s;s in &s;triving to know what is in|du&s;triou&s;ly concealed, I pre&s;ume my denial of gratifying &s;uch curio&s;ity, will not be im|puted to my having le&s;s ambition to appear, in the theory, a per&s;uader of the fair &s;ex to virtue, than I have been, by example, to afford them di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from vice.</P>

<P>IF it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;pect your Lord|&s;hip of ever &s;peaking without de|&s;ign, the compliment you once honored me with, might be reckoned, as mo&s;t compliments are, attended with no meaning: you was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, with an air of plea&s;antry, you thought me the mo&s;t proper per&s;on of my whole &s;ex, to write <HI>the Duty of a Woman;</HI> yet, as the occa&s;ion of your Lord&s;hip's making this remark was a very particular one, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to con&s;true it into mere raillery.

<P>GIVE ear, O ye daughters of beau|ty, attend to the voice of your &s;i&s;ter, for experience hath taught her wi&s;dom, and length of days virtue and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>My father was the brother of <HI>tender|ne&s;s;</HI> my mother was the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>love.</HI></P>
<P>As the ro&s;e-bud opening to the morn, as the dew-drop on the lily, &s;o was the loveline&s;s of my youth.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021184_0006_0FB26E0047A50030">
I awoke at the ri&s;ing of the dawn; my &s;alutation was that of joy and gladne&s;s. <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> beckoned me forth, and I &s;port|ed in the &s;un-&s;hine of <HI>plenty.</HI></P>
<P>The hours were &s;wift, and ran &s;mil|ing away; but the lightne&s;s of my heart out-lived the going down of the &s;un.</P>
<P>The day departed with the milde&s;t breeze, and the night but invited me to the bed of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>My pillow was the &s;ofte&s;t down, my &s;lumbers attended with golden dreams.</P>
<P>Thus one day pa&s;&s;ed away, and the morning of the next found me happy.</P>
<P>Happy are the hours of artle&s;s inno|cence! happy the days of virgin &s;im|plicity, while the bo&s;om is a &s;tranger to deceit, and the heart incon&s;cious of the painful &s;igh!</P>
<P>O that I could overtake the wings of time! O that I could recal the plea&s;ures of my youth! for the days of my wo|manhood have been days of many &s;or|rows; the tears of misfortune have be|dimmed the lu&s;tre of mine eye; the li|ly is fallen, and the ro&s;e-bud is blown and withered on my cheek.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021184_0007_0FB26E056442DA28">
For I li&s;tened to the voice of <HI>adula|tion,</HI> and her bewitching blandi&s;hments allured me to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver tongue of <HI>flattery</HI> is hol|low, and laden with guile; the manna that drops from her lips, is corro&s;ive poi&s;on to the heart.</P>
<P>Hear then, O daughter of Britain. O faire&s;t of the fair among women! let my precepts be trea&s;ured in thy bo&s;om, and walk in the ways of my coun&s;el; &s;o &s;halt thou &s;hun the thorn of reproach, more keen than the bite of the a&s;p, more venemous than the &s;ting of the &s;corpion.</P>
<P>The hand of &s;corn &s;hall point its finger from thee; the tear of mi&s;ery &s;hall never bedew thy cheek; thy life &s;hall be replete with good things, and peace and honour &s;hall &s;atisfy thy &s;oul.</P>

<P>AS the fir&s;t of all evils, as the &s;ource of calamity, as the beginning of
<PB N="8" REF="021184_0008_0FB26E10CAA54010">pain, avoid, O daughter of Eve, the bewitching charm of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Seek not to know what is improper for thee; thir&s;t not after prohibited knowledge; for happier is &s;he who but knoweth a little, than &s;he who is ac|quainted with too much.</P>
<P>Remember thy mother, the daughter of heaven, arrayed in the white&s;t robes of innocence; forget not the fatal con|&s;equence of her di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>How much happier in the bowers of paradi&s;e, fea&s;ting on the lu&s;cious grape of gladne&s;s, than wandering in the wil|derne&s;s of care to chew the bitter weed of repentance!</P>
<P>Be thou contented, therefore, with knowledge fitting for thee; for in the acquaintance of many things, lieth not wi&s;dom; but in the knowledge of that which is meet.</P>
<P>Let the thre&s;hold of thy neighbour's door &s;ecure her family, let her window tempt not thine eye to &s;ee, nor the open ca&s;ement thine ear to hear the &s;e|crets of her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The prying eye is a foe to it&s;elf, and the li&s;tening ear will hear it&s;elf &s;lan|dered.</P>

Art thou inqui&s;itive after deeds of &s;candal and reproof, enquire of thy&s;elf, and thou wilt find employment within.</P>
<P>Art thou a virgin, doth the bloom of health grow lively on thy cheek, &s;tudy not to know the ways of man.</P>
<P>As the way of a &s;erpent in the gra&s;s, or a traveller over the wa&s;te, in a dark night, &s;o the ways of man are danger|ous and hard to find out.</P>
<P>Thy ignorance of his cunning may lay thee open to his deceit; but the knowledge thereof mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence of thy being deceived.</P>

<P>Before thou opene&s;t thy lips to &s;peak, reflect whether thou knowe&s;t the truth of what thou art about to &s;ay, or un|der&s;tande&s;t the matter thereof.</P>
<P>El&s;e thou may&s;t be detected in a fal&s;|hood, and thy a&s;&s;ertions may be an im|peachment to thy under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>So &s;hall the &s;tranger, and the ac|quaintance, repeat thy words to thy di&s;advantage; the &s;incere will de&s;pi&s;e thee, and the wi&s;er than thou, laugh thy folly to &s;corn.</P>
<P>Let thy promi&s;es be few, and &s;uch as thou can&s;t perform; le&s;t thou art re|duced to break thy word, and it be hereafter reckoned of no account.</P>
<P>Be not le&s;s circum&s;pect over thy ac|tions; for the &s;ayings of thy mouth may be forgotten; but the work of thine hands will make a deeper impre&s;&s;ion, and may be la&s;ting cau&s;es of remor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021184_0011_0FB26E18E26EED18">
Con&s;ider what thou art about to do, before thou beginne&s;t thy work; le&s;t thou labour in vain, and the fruit of thy endeavours turn to no end.</P>
<P>Weigh thy &s;trength and thy de&s;ign; le&s;t thou faint under thy burden and fall &s;hort of the recompence of thy toil.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou attempt to reach up to the moon, the nur&s;e would laugh and the young child hold thee in deri&s;ion; yet as well may&s;t thou undertake a work thou can&s;t not perform.</P>
<P>Examine al&s;o the price of thy labour, the con&s;equence of thy deeds; le&s;t, when thou ha&s;t fini&s;hed thy ta&s;k, thou art di&s;&s;atisfied with thy wages.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>VANITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOU art fair as the &s;now-drop of the &s;pring, the ro&s;e of June blows on thy dama&s;k cheek, thine eye
<PB N="12" REF="021184_0012_0FB26E1A52034848">out-&s;parkles the blue lu&s;tre of the &s;ap|phire, thou art &s;tately as the tall fir|tree, and thy pre&s;ence is commanding as maje&s;ty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t and the we&s;t pour forth their trea&s;ures to deck thee; the &s;ea and land give up the pearl and the pre|cious &s;tone; thy array is the fine&s;t &s;ilk; the diamond is a &s;tar on thy bo&s;om, and the ruby and the emerald are interwo|ven with the hair on thy temples.</P>
<P>Therefore vanity hath lifted thee up, thou fluttere&s;t on the wings of thine own conceit, thou de&s;pi&s;e&s;t even the ground where the vulgar tread, thy chariot is drawn by white hor&s;es, and thy feet are hardly con&s;cious of their own burden.</P>
<P>O deluded woman! the butterfly and the gaudy tulip are emblems of thy fan|cied importance.</P>
<P>They are decked in the pride of &s;um|mer, they enjoy the &s;un-&s;hine a while, but &s;hortly fade and attract the eye no more.</P>
<P>Is thy breath perfume, is thy ta&s;te rich? the particoloured carnation and
<PB N="13" REF="021184_0013_0FB26E1F59F65108">the &s;peckled ro&s;e are &s;weet, and the juice of the ripe grape as delicious as thy ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But the rude hand of the &s;poiler com|eth, both in the opening of the bud and at the fulne&s;s of the bloom, and the untimely fro&s;t turns &s;our the rich flavour of the vine.</P>
<P>So misfortune may crop thy imagina|ry greatne&s;s, in the bud of thy joys, or in the full bloom of thy &s;plendor; and the clay-cold hand of di&s;ea&s;e con|vert thy exqui&s;ite ta&s;te to undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>Doth gold pamper thee with dainties, doth the &s;miling a&s;pect of full-fed plen|ty delight thee:</P>
<P>Be not exalted beyond mea&s;ure, for thou knowe&s;t not how &s;oon they may for&s;ake thee: when &s;tarving poverty &s;hall provide &s;craps for thy table, and meagre want, with famine on her hol|low cheek, &s;hall &s;tare thee in the face.</P>
<P>Art thou quick of invention, is thy mind &s;tored with the talents of wit and under&s;tanding, doth the power of elo|cution &s;it on thy tongue, do thy periods flow like honey from thy lips; be not
<PB N="14" REF="021184_0014_0FB26E21FB126BD8">vain-glorious of the&s;e, nor boa&s;t them in thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For the fool will take a plea&s;ure to peck at thee; thy words will be &s;ifted, and thy &s;peeches examined with the nice&s;t &s;everity.</P>
<P>The malicious and the ignorant will catch at the opening of thy mouth; neither &s;hall the ju&s;te&s;t of thy &s;ayings e&s;cape their critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Nay, they will condemn thee unheard, yea, cen&s;ure when thou &s;peake&s;t not.</P>
<P>If thou &s;aye&s;t thou wilt act wi&s;ely and e&s;chew evil, and the frailties of human nature &s;hould overcome thee to do ill, they will then point at thee and cry out, <HI>This is the wi&s;e woman who buildeth her hou&s;e on a rock, who is &s;agacious to do good; let us profit by her example, let us take pattern by her wondrous wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>Avoid therefore, vain-glory and &s;elf-conceit; for &s;he who lifteth her&s;elf up, will others take a pride to pull down; and, if the day of calamity &s;hould come, her fall will be their triumph and their rejoicing.</P>
<P>But the humble &s;hall be honored in pro&s;perity; they &s;hall find favour in ad|ver&s;ity;
