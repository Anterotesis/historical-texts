<P>THere is that <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> in every <HI>True Believer,</HI> but e&s;pecially in every <HI>faith|ful Mini&s;ter</HI> of CHRIST, which engageth them to long and labour for your Salvation. <HI>Life</HI> is communicative and active. It maketh us &s;en|&s;ible that Faith is not a Fanta&s;y, nor true Religi|on a Stage-Play, nor our Hopes of our eternal Hap|pine&s;s a Dream. And as we de&s;ire nothing more for our&s;elves, than to have more of the Holy Life which we have, alas! in &s;o &s;mall a Mea&s;ure; &s;o what is it that we &s;hould more de&s;ire for others? With the Eye of an infallible (tho' too weak) Faith, <HI>we &s;ee</HI> the Heaven which you neglect, and the ble&s;&s;ed Souls in Glory with Chri&s;t, who&s;e Companions you might be forever: We &s;ee the multitude of Souls in Hell, who came thither by the &s;ame Way that you are going in. Who are &s;hut out of the glorious Pre&s;ence of God, and are now among tho&s;e Devils that deceived them, remembering that they had their good Things here, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.25. And how they &s;pent the Day of their Vi&s;itation, and how light they once &s;et by God, by Chri&s;t, by Heaven, by Mercy, whil&s;t Mercy was an earne&s;t Solicitor for their Hearts: And with our bodily Eyes we &s;ee at the &s;ame time, abundance of poor Sinners living about us, as if there were no God, no Chri&s;t, no Heaven, no Hell, no Judgment; nor no Death to be expected;

as if a Man were but a Ma&s;ter-bea&s;t, to rule the re&s;t, and feed upon them, and peri&s;h with them. And if it were here our own Ca&s;e, to &s;ee what Souls do in Heaven and Hell, and at once to &s;ee how unbeliev|ingly, carele&s;ly and &s;en&s;e&s;ly mo&s;t Men live on earth, as if there were no &s;uch difference in another world: Would it not &s;eem a pitiful &s;ight to you? If you had once &s;een the five Brethren of <HI>Dives</HI> on Earth, eat|ing, drinking laughing and merry, cloathed and fa|ring daily with the be&s;t, and at the &s;ame time &s;een their Brother's Soul in Hell, begging in vain for a little Ea&s;e, and wi&s;hing in vain that one from the dead might go warn his Brethren, that they come not to the Place of Torment; would it not &s;eem to you a pitiful Sight? Would not Pity have made you think, [<HI>Is there no way to open the&s;e Gentlemen's Eyes? No way to acquaint them what is become of their Bro|ther, and where</HI> Lazarus <HI>is, and whither they them|&s;elves are going? No one driveth or forceth them to Hell, and will they go thither of them&s;elves? And is there no way to &s;top them or keep them back?</HI>] Did you but &s;ee your&s;elves, what we &s;ee by Faith (be|lieving God) and at once beheld the Saints in Hea|ven, the lo&s;t de&s;pairing Souls in Hell, and the &s;en&s;e|le&s;s &s;en&s;ual Sinners on Earth, that yet they will lay none of this to Heart, &s;ure it would make you won|der at the &s;tupidity of Mankind. Would you not &s;ay, O what a Deceiver is the Devil, that can thus lead on Souls to their own Damnation? O what a Cheater is this tran&s;itory World, that can <HI>make</HI> Man <HI>&s;o forget the World</HI> where they mu&s;t live forever? O what an Enemy is this Fle&s;h, that thus draweth down Men's Souls from God? O what a be&s;otting thing is Sin, that turneth a rea&s;onable Soul into wor&s;e than a Bea&s;t? What a Bedlam is this wicked World, when Thou&s;ands are &s;o bu&s;ily labouring to undo them|&s;elves and others, and gratifying the Devil, again&s;t the GOD and Saviour who would give them an everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ed Life!</P>
<P>And as we have &s;uch a Sight as this by Faith to make us pity you, &s;o have we &s;o much Ta&s;te of the
<PB N="iv" REF="004663_0004_100DE886B59D20D0">
<HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of God, the Sweetne&s;s of his Ways, and the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of Believers, as mu&s;t needs make us wi&s;h, that you had but once tried the &s;ame de|lights, which would turn the Plea&s;ures of &s;in into dete&s;tation. God knoweth that we de&s;ire nothing more for <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> than the Perfection and <HI>Eterni|ty</HI> of this <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> which we <HI>believe and ta&s;te.</HI> And &s;hould we not de&s;ire the &s;ame for you?</P>
<P>And being thus moved with nece&s;&s;ary Pity, we ask of God what he would have us to do for your Salvation; and he hath told us in Scripture, that the Preaching of his Go&s;pel, to acquaint you plainly with the Truth, and earne&s;tly and frequently in|treat you to turn from the Fle&s;h and World to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the Means with which his Grace is ready to concur for your Salvation; when ob&s;ti|nate Re&s;i&s;tance cau&s;eth the Holy Spirit to for&s;ake the Sinner, and leave him to him&s;elf, to follow his own Coun&s;els, Lu&s;ts and Wills.</P>
<P>In this Hope we undertook the &s;acred Mini&s;try, and gave up our&s;elves to this great and mo&s;t im|portant Work, in the great Sen&s;e of our Unwor+thine&s;s, but yet in the &s;en&s;e of your Souls Nece&s;&s;i|ty. We were not &s;uch Fools at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, as not to know it mu&s;t be a Life of Labour, Self-denial and Patience, and the Devil would do his wor&s;t to hinder us, and that all &s;orts of his In&s;tru|ments would be ready to &s;erve him again&s;t our La|bours, and again&s;t your Souls. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> your <HI>Captain</HI> &s;aved by <HI>Patient Conque&s;t,</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t we &s;ave <HI>our|&s;elves and you;</HI> And &s;o mu&s;t <HI>you &s;ave your&s;elves</HI> under Chri&s;t, if ever you be &s;aved. It was not &s;trange to <HI>Paul,</HI> that Bonds and Afflictions did eve|ry where abide him; nor did he account his Life dear, that he might fini&s;h his Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try committed to him by the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 20, 23, 24. It was no &s;trange thing to him, to be <HI>forbidden to preach to the Gentiles, that they might be &s;aved,</HI> by &s;uch as were <HI>filling up the mea&s;ure of their Sins,</HI> and where, under God's <HI>uttermo&s;t Wrath</HI>

on Earth, 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 2.15, 16 Devils and Phari&s;ees, and mo&s;t where they came, both high and low, were again&s;t the Apo&s;tles preaching of the Go&s;pel, and yet they would not &s;acrilegiou&s;ly and cruelly break their Covenant with Chri&s;t, and perfidiou&s;ly de|&s;ert the Souls of Men, even as their Lord, for the love of Souls did call <HI>Peter Satan,</HI> that would have tempted him to &s;ave his Life and Fle&s;h, in&s;tead of making it a Sacrifice for our Sins.</P>
<P>What think you &s;hould move us to undertake a calling &s;o contrary to our fle&s;hly ea&s;e and intere&s;ts? Do we not know the the way of Ea&s;e and Honour? of Wealth and Plea&s;ures, as well as others? And have we not Fle&s;h as well as others? Could we not be content that the Cup of Reproach, and Scorn and Slander, and Poverty and Labours, might pa&s;s from us, if it were not for the Will of God and your Sal|vation? why &s;hould we love to be the lowe&s;t, and troden down by malignant Pride, and counted as the filth of the World, and the Off-&s;couring of all things, repre&s;ented to Rulers whom we honour, as Schi&s;maticks, di&s;obedient, turbulent, unruly, by e|very Church-U&s;urper, whom we refu&s;e to make a God of; why give you not over this Preaching of the Go&s;pel, at the will of Satan, that is, for the <HI>ever|la&s;ting &s;uffering of your Souls,</HI> under the pretence of <HI>making us &s;uffer?</HI> Is not all this that you may be con|verted and &s;aved? If we be herein be&s;ides our&s;elves, it is for you. Could the words of the Ignorant or Proud, have per&s;waded us that either your wants or dangers are &s;o incon&s;iderable, or your other Supplies and Helps &s;ufficient, that our Labours had been un|nece&s;&s;ary to you, God knoweth we &s;hould have rea|dily obeyed <HI>the &s;ilencing &s;ort of Pa&s;tors,</HI> and have be|taken us to &s;ome other land, where our Service had been more nece&s;&s;ary. Let &s;hame be the Hypocrites re|ward, who take not the &s;aving of Souls, and the plea|&s;ing of God, for a &s;ufficient reward, without Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Dignities, Preferments, or worldly Wealth.</P>
<P>I have told you our Motives, I have told you our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Terms of our Undertaking
<PB N="vi" REF="004663_0006_100DE889FA61BD60">
It is God, and you <HI>Sinners,</HI> that next mu&s;t tell us what our Entertainment and Succe&s;s &s;hall be. Shall it &s;till be Neglect and unthankful Contempt, and turning away your Ear and Heart, and &s;aying, we have &s;omewhat el&s;e to mind? Will you &s;till be cheated by this deceiving World? And &s;pend all your Days in pampering your Guts, and providing for your Fle&s;h, that mu&s;t lie rotting very &s;hortly in a Grave? Were you made for no better Work than this? May not we bring you to &s;ome &s;ober thoughts of your Condition, nor one awakened look into the World where you mu&s;t be forever? Nor one Heart-rai&s;ing Thought of the everla&s;ting Glory? Not one Heart-piercing Thought of all your Saviour's Love? Not one Tear for all your &s;inful Lives? O God forbid! Let not our Labour be &s;o de&s;pi&s;ed: Let not your God, your Saviour, and your Souls be &s;et &s;o light by. O let there be no profane Per&s;on among you like <HI>E&s;au,</HI> who, for <HI>one mor&s;el, &s;old</HI> his Birth-right.</P>
<P>Poor Sinners! we talk not to you as on a Stage in cu&s;tomary words, and becau&s;e that talking thus was our Trade; we are in as good earne&s;t with you as if we &s;aw you all Murdering your&s;elves, and we are per&s;uading you to &s;ave your Lives. Can any Man be in a Je&s;t with you who believeth God? Who by Faith fore&s;eeth whither you are going, and what you lo&s;e, and where the Game of Sin will end? It is little better to je&s;t now in Pulpit or in private, than to &s;tand je&s;ting over your departing Souls, when at Death <HI>you</HI> are Breathing <HI>out your</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>Alas! with Shame and Grief we do confe&s;s that we never &s;peak to you of the&s;e things as their truth and weight de&s;erve, nor with the Skill and Wi&s;dom, the Affection and Fervency which be&s;eemeth one engaged in the &s;aving of poor Souls. But yet you may perceive that we are in good Sadne&s;s with you (for God is &s;o) what el&s;e do we &s;tudy for, labour for, &s;uffer for, live for? Why el&s;e do we &s;o much trouble our&s;elves, and trouble you with all this ado, and anger them that would have had us &s;ilent? For my own Part, I will make my free confe&s;&s;ion to you
<PB N="vii" REF="004663_0007_100DE88E09EDF248">
to my &s;hame: That I never grew cold and dull, and pitile&s;s to the Souls of others, till I fir&s;t grew too cold and carele&s;s of my own (unle&s;s when weakne&s;s or &s;peculative &s;tudies cool me, which I mu&s;t confe&s;s they often do.) We never cea&s;e pitying you, till we are growing too like you, and &s;o have need of Pity our&s;elves.</P>
<P>When, through the Mercy of my Lord, the Pro|&s;pect of the World of Souls which I am going to, hath any powerful Operation on my&s;elf; O then, I could &s;pend and be &s;pent for others. No Words are too earne&s;t, no Labour too great, no Co&s;t too dear, the Frowns and Wrath of malignant Oppo&s;ers of the preaching of Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel are nothing to me. But when the World of Spirits di&s;appears, or my Soul is clouded, and receiveth not the vital illuminating Influences of Heaven, <HI>I grow cold,</HI> fir&s;t to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> then to others.</P>
<P>Come then poor Sinners, and help us who are willing at any rate to be your Helpers. As we fir&s;t crave God's Help, &s;o we next crave yours. Help us, for we cannot &s;ave you again&s;t your Wills, nor &s;ave you without your Con&s;ent and Help. God him&s;elf will not &s;ave you without you, and how &s;hould we? We know that the Devil is again&s;t us, &amp; will do his wor&s;t to hinder us, and &s;o will all his Mini&s;ters by what Names or Titles &s;oever dignified or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. But all this is nothing, if you will but take our parts your&s;elves; I mean, if you will take Chri&s;t's part, and your own, and will not be again&s;t your&s;elves. Men and Devils cannot either help or hinder us in &s;aving you, as you may do your&s;elves. If God and you be for us, who &s;hall be again&s;t us?</P>
<P>And <HI>will you help us?</HI> Give over &s;triving again&s;t God, and Con&s;cience, give over fighting again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Spirit: Take part no more with the World and the Fle&s;h, which in your Bapti&s;m you renounced. Set your Hearts to the Me&s;&s;age which we bring you. Allow it your <HI>Man-like &s;ober Thoughts,</HI> &s;earch the Scriptures, and &s;ee whether the things which we &s;peak be &s;o or no. We offer you
<PB N="viii" REF="004663_0008_100DE88F8E602148">
nothing but what we have re&s;olvedly cho&s;en our &s;elves, and that after the mo&s;t &s;erious deliberation that we can make. We have looked round about us, to know what is the Happine&s;s of Man: And had we found better for <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> we had offered better to you. If this World would have &s;erved our turns, it &s;hould have &s;erved yours al&s;o, and we would not have troubled you with the talk of <HI>another World;</HI> but it will not; I am &s;ure it will never &s;erve your turns, to make you happy, nor &s;hall you long make that &s;orry, &s;elf-deceiving &s;hift with it, as now you do.</P>
<P>But if you will not think of the&s;e things, if you will not u&s;e the Rea&s;on of Men, alas what can we do to &s;ave your Souls? O pity them, Lord, that they may pity them&s;elves. Have Mercy on them, that they may have &s;ome more Mercy on them&s;elves and us. Help them, that they may help them&s;elves. If you &s;till refu&s;e, will not your lo&s;s be more than ours? If we lo&s;e our Labour, (which to our&s;elves we &s;hall not) if we lo&s;e our hopes of your Salvati|on, what is this to your everla&s;ting Lo&s;s of Salva|tion it&s;elf? and what are our Sufferings for your &s;akes, in compari&s;on of your endle&s;s Sufferings?</P>
<P>But O, this is what breaketh our Hearts, that we leave you under more guilt than we found you; and when we have laid our Life and Labour to &s;ave you, the impenitent Souls mu&s;t have their Pains in|crea&s;ed for the refu&s;ing of the&s;e Calls. And that it will be Part of your Hell to think forever how madly you refu&s;ed our Coun&s;el; and what Pains and Co&s;t, and Patience were u&s;ed to have &s;aved you, and all in vain. It will be &s;o, it mu&s;t needs be &s;o: Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>It &s;hall be ea&s;ier for</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>in the Day of Judgment,</HI> than for the Re|jecters of his Go&s;pel-calls. The Nature of the <HI>thing,</HI> and the Nature of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> certainly tell you, that it mu&s;t be &s;o</P>
<P>O turn not our Complaints to God again&s;t you; Turn us not from be&s;eeching you to be reconciled to God, to tell him you will not be reconciled.

Force us not to &s;ay, That we earne&s;tly invited you; <HI>Lord, we could have born all our Labour and Suffer|ings for them, much ea&s;ier, if they would but have yielded to thy Grace. But it was they them&s;elves that broke our Hearts, that lo&s;t our Labour, that made us Preach and intreat in vain: It was ea&s;ier to Preach without Maintenance than without Suc|ce&s;s.

<P>I am one that have lookt into Books and Scien|ces, and Speculations of many &s;orts, and &s;eriou&s;ly tell thee as a dying Man, that after all my Searches and Experiences, I have found that Philo&s;ophical Enquiries into the Divine Artifices, and the Nature of Things, hath among a great Number of Un|certainties, a great many Pretty Probabilities which a holy Soul can make good U&s;e of in admiring GOD, and may find us a lawful kind of Sport; but in the Moralities which <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> count Uncertain|ties, the Knowlege of GOD, and our Hopes, the Doctrine and Practice of Holine&s;s, Temperance, and Charity, and Ju&s;tice, and the diligent &s;eeking, and joyful hopes of Life Everla&s;ting, is all the true Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, the Re&s;t and Comfort of a Soul; whatever be our Plea, this is the &s;atisfying certainty, thy Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the beautifying Im|provement of our &s;elves.</P>
<P>I have done when I have &s;ought to remove a little Scandal, which I fore&s;aw, that I &s;hould my &s;elf write the Preface to his Life, where him&s;elf and two of his Friends make &s;uch a mention of my Name, which I cannot own; which will &s;eem a prai&s;ing him for prai&s;ing me.

Had I directed their Pens, they &s;hould have gone a middle way and only e&s;teem|ed me a very unworthy Servant of Chri&s;t, (who yet

now to do; what can there be &s;aid to this Man that's like to bring him to good? Friend, know thy &s;elf better, or thou peri&s;he&s;t with out Remedy. Thou maye&s;t pray, but what hope is there in thy Pray|ing: Thou maye&s;t read, but what Hope is there in thy Reading? Yet read on, this little hope there is, in this Book there is <HI>Eye &s;alve</HI> that may heal thee of thy Blindne&s;s. In this Book there is a <HI>Gla&s;s,</HI> that will &s;hew thee thy Face. Do&s;t thou know thine own Face when thou &s;ee&s;t it? Behold thy very I|mage in tho&s;e Marks that are given of an uncon|verted Per&s;on. Read and con&s;ider them, and then &s;ay, if thou be not the Man.</P>
<P>Be willing to know thy &s;elf, and to know the wor&s;t of thy Ca&s;e. Wink not at the Light; hide not thy &s;elf from thine own Soul. Wilt thou never know thy Di&s;ea&s;e till it be pa&s;t remedy?</P>
<P>Much of our harde&s;t Work would be over, if we could &s;ee the Sinners to whom we are &s;ent, to be convinced Sinners: If we could but open the blind Eyes, there were hopes we &s;hould &s;hortly rai&s;e the Dead.</P>
<P>Sinner, of a truth thou art in evil ca&s;e, whether thou know it or not; thou art among the dead, and there is but a &s;tep betwixt thee and Hell. Thou wilt not believe it though it be told thee; yet once again let me be&s;eech thee, come to the Gla&s;s that is here pre&s;ented to thee, and narrowly ob&s;erve whether the very Marks of the Dead be not found upon thee.</P>
<P>If there be mi&s;carriage in this fir&s;t work, if thou wilt not under&s;tand thy Mi&s;ery, and thy danger, there is an end of all hopes concerning thee. Whil&s;t Self-ignorance abides upon thee, all the Coun&s;els that are nece&s;&s;ary for a Man in thy ca&s;e, will do thee no good, they are never like to pro&s;per with thee, becau&s;e thou wilt not count them proper for thee. Who will be per&s;waded to do that which he believes is already done? Who will take the Coun&s;el of the Phy&s;ician that does not think him&s;elf &s;ick? The Man of God may &s;pare his pains of per&s;wad|ing thee to Conver&s;ion, whil&s;t thou art confident

thou art converted already: Who will be at the pains of Repentance that concludes he hath re|pented? who will bear the Labour and the Pangs of the New Birth, that is confident he is already pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life.</P>
<P>But Friend, let me a little rea&s;on with thee; thou art confident it is well with thee, yet why wilt thou not yield to thus much at lea&s;t, to put it to the que|&s;tion, <HI>Am I not mi&s;taken?</HI> Thou art wor&s;e than mad, if thou thinke&s;t &s;uch a Que&s;tion may not be put. Do&s;t thou know that thy Heart is fal&s;e and de|ceitful, and yet becau&s;e it &s;peaks good conerning thee, mu&s;t it not be que&s;tioned whether it &s;peaks truth or no? Be &s;o wi&s;e as to conclude, <HI>I may be mi&s;taken,</HI> and thus come to the Trial whether thou art mi&s;taken or not.</P>
<P>And if upon Trial by the Marks that are before thee, thou come to be undeceived, and &s;ee thy &s;elf wrapped up in that Mi&s;ery which hitherto thou woulde&s;t not &s;u&s;pect, the next news <HI>I expect</HI> to hear from thee is, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;av'd?</HI> O were it come to that once, Then thou ha&s;t an an&s;wer at hand in tho&s;e means thou wilt find pre&s;cribed thee. And becau&s;e they are &s;uch as thou wilt hardly be per|&s;waded to u&s;e, take in the Motives that follow, and the&s;e will help down the means Con&s;ider both the one and the other, and if thou do&s;t not find the means proper, and the motives weighty, I think I &s;hall do thee no wrong, if I tell thee, thou art &s;till of a blind Mind, and an harder Heart.</P>
<P>The matter which this little Book comes to treat with thee about, is of the highe&s;t Importance; 'Tis a matter of Life or Death. If thou &s;aye&s;t the Terms upon which Life is offered, are hard; con&s;ider, is it not harder to die? He is worthy to die who will lo&s;e his Soul to &s;ave his Labour. If thou could &s;tep down into the deep, and take a turn or two with tho&s;e damned Souls who are drenched with Fire and Brim&s;tone, and bound in everla&s;ting chains of vengeance, and &s;hould ask them now what do you think of the Terms upon which Life was offered?

<HEAD>An Earne&s;t Invitation to SINNERS, to turn to GOD, in order to their Eternal Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>DEarly Beloved, and longed for; I gladly ac|knowledge my &s;elf a Debtor to you all; and am concerned, as I would be found a good Steward to the Hou&s;hold of God, to give to every one his Portion. But the Phy&s;ician is mo&s;t &s;olicitous for tho&s;e Patients, who&s;e Ca&s;e is mo&s;t doubtful and hazardous; and the Father's Bowels are e&s;pecially turned towards his dying Child. The Numbers of the Unconverted Souls among you, call for my mo&s;t earne&s;t Compa&s;&s;ions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ty Diligence, to pluck them out of the Burning. <HI>Jude</HI> 23. and therefore to the&s;e <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> I &s;hall apply my &s;elf in the&s;e Lines.</P>
<P>But whence &s;hall I fetch my Arguments, or how &s;hall I choo&s;e my Words? Lord, wherewith &s;hall I woo them? wherewith &s;hall I win them? Oh, that I could but tell! I would write unto them in Tears, I would weep out every Argument, I would empty my Veins for Ink, I would petition them on my Knees; verily (were I able) I would. Oh, how thankful I would be, if they would be pre|vailed with to repent and turn!</P>
<P>How long have I travailed in Birth with you? How frequently have I made Suit to you? How often would I have gathered you? Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tant have I been with you?

might you make me, if you would but hearken to me, and &s;uffer me to carry you over to Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</P>
<P><Q>But, Lord, how in&s;ufficient am I for this work! I have been many a Year wooing for Thee, but the Dam&s;el would not go with me Lord, what a Task ha&s;t thou &s;et me to do? Alas, wherewith &s;hall I pierce the Scales of <HI>Leviathan,</HI> or make the Heart to feel that it is hard as a Stone, hard as a Piece of the Nether-mil&s;tone! Shall I go and lay my Mouth to the Grave, and look when the Dead will obey me, and come forth? Shall I make an Oration to the Rocks, or declaim to the Moun|tains, and think to move them with Arguments? Shall I give the blind to &s;ee? From the beginning of the World was it not heard that a Man opened the Eyes of the Blind? But Thou, O Lord, can&s;t pierce the Scales and prick the Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Sinner.

<P>But I mu&s;t apply my &s;elf to you, to whom I am &s;ent: yet I am at a great Lo&s;s Would to God I knew how to go to work with you! Would I &s;tick at the pains?

<P>The Famous <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> having in&s;tituted mo&s;t &s;trict and whole&s;ome Laws for his People, told them he was nece&s;&s;itated to go a Journey from them, and got them to bind them&s;elves in an Oath, that his Laws &s;hould be ob&s;erved till his return. This done, he went into a voluntary Bani&s;hment, and never returned more, that they might, by vertue of their Oath, be engaged to the perpetual ob|&s;erving of his Laws. Methinks I &s;hould be glad of the hard Conditions which he endured (tho' I love you tenderly) &s;o I might but hereby engage you throughly to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved, would you rejoice the Heart of your Mini&s;ter? Why then, embrace the Coun&s;els of the Lord by me: forego your Sins: &s;et to Pra|yer: up with the Wor&s;hip of God in your Families: keep at a di&s;tance from Corruptions of the Times. What greater joy to a Mini&s;ter, than to hear of Souls born unto Chri&s;t by him, and that his Chil|dren walk in Truth? 2 <HI>John</HI> 4.</P>
<P>Brethren, I be&s;eech you &s;uffer friendly Plain|ne&s;s and freedom with you in your deepe&s;t concern|ments. I am not playing the Orator to make a lear|ned &s;peech to you, nor dre&s;&s;ing my di&s;h with elo|quence wherewith to plea&s;e you.

<P>Well, in this you &s;ee all are agreed, that be it more or le&s;s that is received in Bapti&s;m, if (when Men come to years) they are evidently un&s;anctified, they mu&s;t be renewed again by a thorough and powerful change, or el&s;e they cannot e&s;cape the damnation of Hell.

<P>Conver&s;ion then, in &s;hort, lies in the thorough Change both of the Heart and Life. I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe it in its Nature and Cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>The Author of it is the Spirit of God;</HI> and therefore it is called the &s;anctification of the Spirit, 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 2.13. and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5.

<P>More particularly this Change of conver&s;ion pa&s;&s;es throughout the whole Subject.

Conver&s;ion is no repairing of the old Building, but it takes all down, and erects a new Structure: It is not the putting in a patch, or &s;owing on a Li&s;t of Holine&s;s: but with the true Convert, Holine&s;s is woven into all his Powers, Principles, and Practice. The &s;incere Chri&s;tian is quite a new Fabrick, from the Foundation to the Top &s;tone, all Fire-new. He is a new Man, <HI>Eph</HI> 4, 24. a new Creature.

I may di&s;pute with them Year after Year, and they will give me the hear|ing, and that is all. They mu&s;t and will have their Sins, &s;ay what I will: Tho' I tell them there is Death in the Cup, yet they will take it up; Tho' I tell them 'tis the Broad-way, and endeth in De&s;truc|tion, yet they will go on in it: I warn them, yet cannot win them. Sometimes I think, the Mercies of God will melt them, and his winning Invitations will overcome them, but I find them as they were. Sometimes, that the Terror of the Lord will per|&s;uade them; yet neither will this do it. They will approve the Word, like the Sermon, commend the Preacher; but they will yet live as they did They will not deny me, yet they will not obey me. They will flock to the Word of God, and &s;it before me as his People, and hear my Words; but they will not do them. They value, and will plead for Mini&s;ters, and I am to them as the lovely Song of one that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ant Voice; yet I cannot get them to come under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Yoke.

Alas, for my unconverted Hearers, they mu&s;t be undeceived, or undone. But how &s;hall this be effected? <HI>Hic labor, hoc opus e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Help, O All &s;earching Light! and let thy di&s;cerning Eye di&s;cover the rotten Foundation of the Self deceiver; and lead me, O Lord God, as thou did&s;t the Prophet, into the Chambers of Imagery, and dig through the Wall of Sinners Hearts, and di&s;cover the hidden Abominations that are lurking out of &s;ight, in the dark.

<P>This mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, before we proceed to the Di&s;covery, That it is mo&s;t certain Men may have a confident Per&s;wa&s;ion, that their Hearts and States be good, and yet be un&s;ound. Hear the Truth him|&s;elf, who &s;hews in <HI>Laodicea</HI>'s Ca&s;e, that Men may be wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and yet not know it; yea, they may be confident they are rich, and increa&s;ed in Grace&punc; <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. <HI>There is a Generation that is pure in their own Eyes, and yet is not wa&s;hed from their own Filthine&s;s,</HI> Prov. 30.12.

The Apo&s;tle reckons up &s;ome, upon whom he writes the Sentence of Death, as in the&s;e dreadful Cata|logues, which I be&s;eech you to attend with all Dili|gence, Eph. 5.5, 6. <HI>For this you know, that no Whore-monger, nor unclean Per&s;on, nor covetous Man, who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God: Let no Man deceive you with vain Words; for becau&s;e of the&s;e Things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Di&s;obedience,</HI> Rev. 21.8. <HI>But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abo|minable, and Murderers, and Whore-mongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars, &s;hall have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the Second Death.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <HI>Know ye not, that the Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God?

<P>Direct. XI. <HI>Take Heed of delaying thy Conver&s;ion, and &s;et upon a &s;peedy and pre&s;ent Turning. I made ha&s;te and delayed not,</HI> P&s;al. 119.60. Remember and tremble at the &s;ad In&s;tance of the fooli&s;h Virgins, that came not till the Door of Mercy was &s;hut, <HI>Matth.</HI> 21. and of a convinced <HI>Felix,</HI> that put off <HI>Paul</HI> to another Sea&s;on; and we never find that he had &s;uch a Sea&s;on more, <HI>Acts</HI> 94.25. Oh, come in while it is called to Day, le&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t be hardned thro' the Deceit|fulne&s;s of Sin; left the Day of Grace &s;hould be over, and the Things that belong to thy Peace &s;hould be hid from thine Eyes. Now Mercy is wooing of thee: Now Chri&s;t is waiting to be gracious to thee, and the Spirit of God is &s;triving with thee: Now Mini|&s;ters are calling; now Con&s;cience is &s;tirring: Now the Market is open, and Oil may be had, thou ha&s;t Opportunity for the Buying: Now Chri&s;t is to be had for the Taking. Oh! &s;trike in with the Offers of Grace: Oh, now or never. If thou make light of this Offer, God may &s;wear in his Wrath, thou &s;halt never ta&s;te of his Supper, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.24.</P>

To every Sermon thou heare&s;t, come with this Thought; <HI>Oh, I hope God will now come in; I hope this Day may be the Time, this may be the Man by whom God will bring me Home.</HI> When thou art coming to the Ordinances, lift up thy Heart thus to God: <HI>Lord, let this be the Sabbath, let this be the Sea&s;on, wherein I may receive renewing Grace.

<P>Direct. XIII. <HI>Strike in with the Spirit, when he begins to work upon thy Heart.</HI> When he works Con|victions, oh do not &s;tifle them, but join in with him; and beg the Lord to carry on Convictions, to Conver&s;ion. Quench not the Spirit, do not out|&s;trive him, do not re&s;i&s;t him. Beware of putting out Convictions by evil Company or Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s. When thou finde&s;t any Troubles for Sin, and Fears about thy eternal State, beg of God, that they may never leave thee, till they have wrought off thy Heart throughly from Sin, and wrought it over to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Say to him, <HI>Strike home, Lord; leave not the Work in the Mid&s;t. If thou &s;ee&s;t that I am not yet wounded enough, that I am not troubled enough, wound me yet deeper, Lord: Oh, go to the Bottom of my Corruption, let out the Life-Blood of my Sins.</HI> Thus yield up thy &s;elf to the Workings of the Spirit, and hoi&s;t thy Sails to his Gu&s;ts.</P>

But cold and lifele&s;s Devotions will not reach half Way to Heaven; Be fervent and importunate; Importunity will carry it, but without Violence the Kingdom of Heaven will not be taken, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.12.

<HEAD>A &s;hort Soliloquy for an Unregenerate Sinner.</HEAD>
<P>AH Wretched Man that I am! What a Condi+tion have I brought my&s;elf into by Sin? Oh! I &s;ee my Heart hath but deceived me all this while, in flattering me that my Condition was good. I &s;ee, I &s;ee, I am but a lo&s;t and undone Man, for ever un|done, unle&s;s the Lord help me out of this Condition My Sins! my Sins! Lord, what an unclean, polluted Wretch am I! More loath&s;ome and odious to thee&punc; than the mo&s;t hateful Venom, or noi&s;ome Carca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can be to me. Oh! what a Hell of Sin is in this Heart of mine, which I have flattered my&s;elf to be a good Heart. Lord, how univer&s;ally am I corrupted, in all my Parts, Powers, Performances! All the Imaginations of the Thoughts of my Heart are only evil continually. I am under an Inability to, Aver&s;e+ne&s;s from, and Enmity again&s;t any Thing that is good; and am prone to all that is evil. My Heart is a very Sink of all Sin: And Oh the innumerable Ho&s;ts and Swarms of &s;inful Thoughts, Words and Actions, that have flown from thence! Oh the Lord of Guilt that is on my Soul! <HI>My Head is full, my Heartfull, my Mind and my Members, they are full of Sin.</HI> O my Sins! how do they &s;tare upon me? How do they witne&s;s again&s;t me? Wo is me, my Creditors are upon me, every Commandment taketh hold upon me, for more than ten Thou&s;and Talents, yea, ten Thou&s;and times ten Thou&s;and. How end|le&s;s then is the Sum of all my Debts! If this whole World were filled up from Earth to Heaven with Paper, and all this Paper written over, within and without, by Arithmeticians; yet when all were ca&s;t up together, it would come unconceivably &s;hort of what I owe to the lea&s;t of God's Commandments. Wo unto me, for my Debts are infinite, and my Sins

are increa&s;ed; they are Wrongs to an infinite Maje|&s;ty: And if he that committeth Trea&s;on again&s;t a &s;ilken Mortal, is worthy to be racked, drawn, and quartered; what have I de&s;erved, that have &s;o often lifted up my Hand again&s;t Heaven, and have &s;truck at the Crown and Dignity of the Almighty?</P>
<P>O my Sins! my Sins! Behold, a Troop cometh! Multitudes, Multitudes! there is no Number of their Armies. Innumerable Evils have compa&s;&s;ed me about: Mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me; they have &s;et them&s;elves in Array again&s;t me. Oh! it were better to have all the Regiments of Hell come again&s;t me, than to have my Sins to fall upon me, to the &s;poiling of my Soul. Lord, how am I &s;urrounded? how many are they that ri&s;e up again&s;t me? They have be&s;et me behind and before: They &s;warm within me, and without me: They have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all my Powers, and have fortified mine unhappy Soul as a Garri&s;on, which this Brood of Hell doth man, and maintain again&s;t the God that made me.</P>
<P>And they are as mighty, as they are many: The Sands are many, but then they are not great: The Mountains great, but then they are not many: But wo is me! my Sins are as many as the Sands, and as mighty as the Mountains; their Weight is greater than their Number. It were better that the Rocks and the Mountains &s;hould fall upon me, than the cru&s;hing and in&s;upportable Load of my own Sins. Lord, I am heavy loaden; let Mercy help, or I am gone. Unload me of this heavy Guilt, this &s;inking Load, or I am cru&s;hed without Hope, and mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed down to Hell. If my Grief were thorowly weighed, and all my Sins laid in the Ballances to|gether, they would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea; therefore my Words are &s;wallowed up; the would weigh down all the Rocks, and the Hills, and turn the Ballance again&s;t all the I&s;les of the Earth O Lord, thou knowe&s;t my manifold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and my mighty Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="004663_0159_100DE0C8F6F55600">Ah, my Soul! Alas, my Glory! Whither art thou humbled? Once the Glory of the Creation, and the Image of God; now a Lump of Filthine&s;s, a Coffin of Rottenne&s;s, repleni&s;hed with Stench and Loath&s;omne&s;s. Oh, what Work hath Sin made with thee! Thou &s;halt be termed <HI>For&s;aken,</HI> and all the Rooms of thy Faculties <HI>De&s;olate,</HI> and the Name that thou &s;halt be called by, it is <HI>Ichabod,</HI> or, <HI>Where is the Glory?</HI> How art thou come down mightily? My Beauty is turned into Deformity, and my Glory into Shame. Lord, what a loath&s;ome Leper am I? The ulcerous Bodies of <HI>Job</HI> or <HI>Lazarus</HI> were not more offen&s;ive to the Eyes and No&s;trils of Men, than I mu&s;t needs be to the mo&s;t Holy God, who&s;e Eyes cannot behold Iniquity.</P>
<P>And what Mi&s;ery have my Sins brought on me? Lord, what a Ca&s;e am I in! Sold under Sin, ca&s;t out of God's Favour, accur&s;ed from the Lord, cur&s;ed in my Body, cur&s;ed in my Soul, cur&s;ed in my Name, my E&s;tate, my Relations, and all that I have. My Sins are unpardoned, and my Soul within a Step of Death. Alas! what &s;hall I do? Whither &s;hall I go? Which Way &s;hall I look? God is frowning on me from above; Hell gaping for me beneath; Con&s;cience &s;miting me within; Temptations and Dangers &s;urrounding me without. Oh, whither &s;hall I flee? What Place can hide me from Omni&s;ciency? What Power can &s;ecure me from Omnipotency?</P>
<P>What meane&s;t thou, O my Soul, to go on thus? Art thou in League with Hell? Ha&s;t thou made a Covenant with Death? Art thou in Love with thy Mi&s;ery? Is it good for thee to be here? Alas! what &s;hall I do? Shall I go on in my &s;inful Ways? Why then certain Damnation will be mine End. And &s;hall I be &s;o be&s;otted and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dded, as to go and &s;ell my Soul to the Flames for a little Ale, and a little Ea&s;e; for a little Plea&s;ure, or Gain, or Con|tent to my Fle&s;h? Shall I linger any longer in this wretched E&s;tate? No, if I tarry here, I &s;hall die.
<PB N="136" REF="004663_0160_100DE0CA94E6A1B8">
What then? Is there no Help, no Hope? None, except I turn. Why, but is there any Remedy for &s;uch woful Mi&s;ery? Any Mercy after &s;uch provok|ing Iniquity? Yes, as &s;ure as God's Oath is true, I &s;hall have Pardon and Mercy yet, if pre&s;ently, un|feignedly and unre&s;ervedly I turn by Chri&s;t to him.</P>
<P>Why then I thank thee upon the bended Knees of my Soul, O mo&s;t merciful <HI>Jehovah,</HI> that thy Patience hath waited upon me hitherto: For had&s;t thou took me away in this E&s;tate, I had peri&s;hed for ever. And now I adore thy Grace, and accept the Offers of thy Mercy: I renounce all my Sins, and re&s;olve, by thy Grace, to &s;et my&s;elf again&s;t them, and to follow thee, in Holine&s;s and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, all the Days of my Life.</P>
<P>Who am I, Lord, that I &s;hould make any Claim unto thee, or have any Part or Pottion in thee, who am not worthy to lick up the Du&s;t of thy Feet? Yet &s;ince thou holde&s;t forth the golden Scepter, I am bold to come and touch. To de&s;pair, would be to de&s;parage thy Mercy; and to &s;tand off when thou bidde&s;t me come, would be at once to undo my&s;elf, and rebel again&s;t thee, under the Pretence of Humi|lity. Therefore I bow my Soul to thee, and with all po&s;&s;ible Thankfulne&s;s accept thee as mine, and give up my&s;elf to thee as thine. Thou &s;halt be Sovereign over me, my King, and my God: Thou &s;halt be in the Throne, and all my Powers &s;hall bow to thee, they &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thy Feet: Thou &s;halt be my Portion, O Lord, and I will re&s;t in thee.</P>
<P>Thou calle&s;t for my Heart: O that it were any Way fit for thine Acceptance! I am unworthy, O Lord, everla&s;tingly unworthy to be thine: But &s;ince thou wilt have it &s;o, I freely give up my Heart to thee; take it, it is thine: Oh that it were better. But, Lord, I put it into thine Hand, who alone can&s;t mend it: Mould it after thine own Heart; make it as thou would&s;t have it, holy, humble, heavenly, &s;oft, tender, flexible; and write thy Law upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="004663_0161_100DE0CEF9E03D08">Come, Lord Je&s;us; come quickly; enter in tri|umphantly: Take me up to thee for ever. I give up to thee, I come to thee, as the only Way to the Father, as the only Mediator, the Means ordained to bring me to God. I have de&s;troyed my&s;elf, but in thee is my Help: Save, Lord, or el&s;e I peri&s;h: I come to thee with the Rope about my Neck; I am worthy to die, and to be damned. Never was the Hire more due to the Servant, never was the Penny more due to the Labourer, than Death and Hell, my ju&s;t Wages, is due to me for my Sins: But I fly to thy Merits, I tru&s;t alone to the Value and Vertue of thy Sacrifice, and Prevalency of thy Interce&s;&s;ion: I &s;ubmit to thy Teaching, I make choice of thy Government. Stand open, ye everla&s;ting Doors, that the King of Glory may come in.</P>
<P>O Thou Spirit of the Mo&s;t High, the Comforter and Sanctifier of thy cho&s;en; come in with all thy glorious Train, all thy courtly Attendants, thy Fruits, and Graces. Let me be thine Inhabitation. I can give thee but what is thine own already; but here with the poor Widow, I ca&s;t my two Mites, my Soul and my Body, into thy Trea&s;ury; fully re&s;igning them up to thee, to be &s;anctified by thee, to be Servants to thee. They &s;hall be thy Patients, cure thou their Malady; they &s;hall be thy Agents, govern thou their Motions. Too long have I &s;erved the World, too long have I hearkned to Satan; but now I renounce them all, and will be ruled by thy Dictates and Directions, and guided by thy Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>O Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity! O glorious Unity! I deliver up my&s;elf to thee, receive me; write thy Name, O Lord, upon me, and upon all that I have, as thy proper Goods: Set thy Mark upon me, upon every Member of my Body, and every Faculty of my Soul. I have cho&s;en thy Precepts, thy Law will I lay before me: This &s;hall be the Copy which I will keep in my Eye, and &s;tudy to write after. Accord|ing to this Rule do I re&s;olve, by thy Grace, to walk; after this Law &s;hall my whole Man be governed;
<PB N="138" REF="004663_0162_100DE0D2B5888760">
and tho' I cannot perfectly keep one of thy Com|mandments, yet I will allow my&s;elf in the Breach of none. I know my Fle&s;h will hang back, but I re&s;olve, in the Power of thy Grace, to cleave to thee, and thy holy Ways, whatever it co&s;t me. I am &s;ure I cannot come off a Lo&s;er by thee, therefore I will be content with Reproach, and Difficulties, and Hard&s;hips here; and will deny my&s;elf, and take up my Cro&s;s, and follow thee. Lord Je&s;us, thy Yoke is ea&s;y, and thy Cro&s;s is welcome, as it is the Way to thee. I lay a&s;ide all Hopes of worldly Happine&s;s, I will be content to tarry till I come to thee: Let me be poor and low, little and de&s;pi&s;ed here, &s;o I may be but admitted to live and reign with thee hereafter. Lord, thou ha&s;t my Heart and Hand to this Agree|ment: Be it as the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> never to be rever&s;ed: To this I will &s;tand, in this Re&s;olution, by Grace, I will live and die.

<P>THO' what is already &s;aid of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion, and of the Mi&s;eries of the Un|converted, might be &s;ufficient to induce any con&s;i|dering Mind to re&s;olve upon a pre&s;ent Turning, or Conver&s;ion unto God; yet knowing what a Piece of de&s;perate Ob&s;tinacy and Untractablene&s;s the Heart of Man naturally is, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to add to the Means of Conver&s;ion, and Directions for a Covenant clo&s;ure with God in Chri&s;t, &s;ome Motives to per&s;uade you hereunto</P>

Alas, that I &s;hould have &s;pent my Strength for nought! And now I am ca&s;ting my la&s;t; Lord Je&s;us, &s;tand thou upon the Shore, and direct how and where I &s;hall &s;pread my Net; and let me &s;o inclo&s;e with Arguments the Souls I &s;eek for, that that may not be able to get out.</Q> Now, Lord, for a Multitude of Souls! Now for a full Draught! O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and &s;trengthen me this once, O God.</P>
<P>But I turn unto you.</P>
<P>Men and Brethren, Heaven and Earth doth call upon you; yea, Hell it&s;elf doth preach the Doctrine of Repentance unto you: the Angels of the Churches travail with you, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. the Angels of Heaven wait for you, for your repenting, and turning unto God. O Sinner, why &s;hould the Devil make merry with thee? Why &s;hould thou be a Mor&s;el for that devouring <HI>Leviathan?</HI> Why &s;hould Harpies and Hell|hounds tear thee, and make a Fea&s;t upon thee; and when they have got thee into the Snare, and have la&s;tned their Talons in thee, laugh at thy De&s;truction, and deride thy Mi&s;ery, and &s;port them&s;elves with thy damnable Folly? This mu&s;t be thy Ca&s;e, except thou turn. And were it not better thou &s;hould&s;t be a Joy to Angels, than a Laughing-&s;tock and Sport for Devils? Verily, if thou would&s;t but come in, the heavenly Ho&s;t would take up their Anthems, and &s;ing, <HI>Glory be to God in the Highe&s;t;</HI> the Morning-Stars would &s;ing together, and all the Sons of God &s;hout for Joy, and celebrate this new Creation as they did the fir&s;t.

The true Penitent's Tears, are indeed the Wine that cheareth both God and Man.</P>
<P>If it be little, that Men and Angels would rejoice at thy Conver&s;ion, know that God him&s;elf would rejoice over thee, even with &s;inging, and re&s;t in his Love, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.9. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 62.5. Never did <HI>Jacob</HI> with &s;uch Joy weep over the Neck of his <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> as thy heavenly Father would rejoice over thee, upon thy coming in to him. Look over the Story of the Prodigal; methinks I &s;ee how the aged Father lays a&s;ide his E&s;tate, and forgets his Years. Behold how he runneth, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.20. Oh the Ha&s;te that Mercy makes! the Sinner makes not half that Speed. Methinks I &s;ee how his Bowels turn, how his Compa&s;&s;ions yearn. (How quick-&s;ighted is Love!) Mercy &s;pies him a great Way off, forgets his riotous Cour&s;es, unnatural Rebellion, horrid Unthankfulne&s;s, debauched Practice (not a Word of the&s;e) but receives him with open Arms, cla&s;ps about his Neck, forgets the Na&s;tine&s;s of his Rags, ki&s;&s;eth the Lips that de&s;erve to be loathed, the Lips that had been joined to Harlots, that had been Commoners with the Swine; calls for the fatted Calf, the be&s;t Robe, the Ring, the Shoes, the be&s;t Chear in Heaven's Store, the be&s;t Attire in Heaven's Wardrobe, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.6, 9, 23.

Methinks I hear the Mu&s;ick and the Dancing at a Di&s;tance. Oh the Melody of the heavenly Chori&s;ters! I cannot learn the Song, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.3. but methinks I over-hear the Burden, at which all the Harmonious Quire with one Con&s;ent &s;trike &s;weetly in; for thus goes the Round at Heaven's Table, <HI>For this my Son was dead, and

Why, hear the Voice from the Dead, from the Damned, crying to thee that thou &s;hould&s;t repent. <HI>I pray thee, that thou would&s;t &s;end him to my Father's Hou&s;e; for I have five Brethren, that he may te&s;tify unto them, le&s;t they al&s;o come into this Place of Torment. If one went unto them from the Dead, they will repent,</HI> Luke 16.27, 28, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hear, O Man! thy Predece&s;&s;ors in Impenitence preach to thee from the infernal Gibbets, from the Flames, from the Rack, that thou &s;hould&s;t repent. Oh, look down in the Bottomle&s;s pit: See&s;t thou how the Smoke of their Torment a&s;cendeth for ever and ever? <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.11. How black are the Fiends? How furious are their Torments!

How long will you linger in <HI>Sodom?</HI> How long will you halt between two Opinions? 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.21. Are you not yet re&s;olved whether Chri&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Barab|bas,</HI> whether bli&s;s or torment, whether the Land of <HI>Cabul,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 9.13. or the Paradi&s;e of God, be the better choice? Is it a di&s;putable Ca&s;e, whether the <HI>Abana</HI> and <HI>Parphar</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> be better than all the Streams of <HI>Eden?</HI> or whether the vile puddle of Sin be to be preferred before the Water of Life, clear as Cry&s;tal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb? Can the World in good earne&s;t, do that for you, that Chri&s;t can? Will it &s;tand by you to Eternity? Will Plea&s;ures, Titles, Lands, Trea|&s;ures, de&s;cend with you? <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 49.17. 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 6.7. If not, had you not need look after &s;omewhat that will? What mean you to &s;tand wavering, to be off and on? Fooli&s;h Children! how long will you &s;tick between the womb and the world? Shall I leave you at la&s;t no farther than <HI>Agrippa,</HI> but almo&s;t per&s;uad|ed? Why, you are forever lo&s;t, if left here: As good not at all, as not altogether Chri&s;tians. You are half of the mind to give over your former ne|gligent Life, and to &s;et a &s;trict and holy cour&s;e; you could wi&s;h you were as &s;ome others be, and could do as they can do: How long will you re&s;t in idle Wi&s;hes, and fruitle&s;s Purpo&s;es? When will you come to a fixed, full and firm Re&s;olve? Do not you &s;ee how Satan gulls you, by tempting you to De|lays? How long hath he toll'd you on the Way of Perdition? How many Years have you been pur|po&s;ing to amend? What if God &s;hould have taken you off this while?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="004663_0178_100DE0FC896E3EE0">Well, put me not off with a dilatory An&s;wer: Tell me not of hereafter, I mu&s;t have your pre&s;ent Con&s;ent. If you be not now re&s;olved, while the Lord is treating with you, and wooing of you, much le&s;s are you like to be hereafter, when the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions are worn out, and you are hardned through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin. Will you give me your Hands? Will you &s;et open the Doors, and give the Lord Je&s;us the full and pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? Will you put your Names into his Covenant? Will you &s;ub&s;cribe? What do you re&s;olve upon? If you are &s;till upon your Delays, my labour is lo&s;t, and all is like to come to nothing. Fain I would, that you &s;hould now put in your adventures: Come ca&s;t in your Lot, make your choice: <HI>Now is the accepted Time, now is the Day of thy Salvation: To Day if you will hear his Voice.</HI> Why &s;hould not this be the Day from whence thou &s;hould&s;t be able to date thine Happine&s;s? Why &s;hould&s;t thou venture a day longer in this dangerous and dreadful condition? What if God &s;hould this Night require thy Soul? <HI>Oh that thou mighte&s;t know in this thy day the things that be|long unto thy peace, before they be hid from thine eyes,</HI> Luke 19.42. This is the day, and it is but the day, <HI>John</HI> 9.4. Others have had their day, and have re|ceived their doom; and now art thou brought upon the &s;tage of this World, here to act thy part for the whole Eternity. Remember thou art now upon thy good Behaviour for everla&s;ting; if thou make not a wi&s;e Choice now, thou art undone forever. Look what thy pre&s;ent choice is, &s;uch mu&s;t thine Eter|nal Condition be, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.24. and 16.25. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.27, 28, 29.</P>
<P>And is it true indeed? Is Life and Death at thy choice? Yea, it is as true as Truth is, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.19. Why then, what hinders but that thou &s;hould&s;t be happy? Nothing doth or can hinder, but thine own wilful neglect, or refu&s;al. It was the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Eunuch</HI> to <HI>Philip, See, here is Water: What doth hin|der me to be baptized?</HI> So I may &s;ay to thee, See, here

is Chri&s;t, here is Mercy, Pardon, Life: What hin|ders, but that thou &s;hould&s;t be pardoned and &s;aved? One of the Martyrs, as he was praying at the &s;take, had his Pardon &s;et by in a Box, which indeed he refu&s;ed de&s;ervedly, becau&s;e upon unworthy terms: But here the terms are mo&s;t honourable and ea&s;y. O Sinner! wilt thou burn with thy Pardon by thee? Why, do but forthwith give up thy Con&s;ent to Chri&s;t, to renounce thy Sins, deny thy&s;elf, take up the Yoke, and the Cro&s;s, and thou carrie&s;t the Day, Chri&s;t is thine, Pardon, Peace, Life, Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, all are thine: And is not this an offer worth em|bracing? Why &s;hould&s;t thou he&s;itate, or doubtfully di&s;pute about the Ca&s;e? Is it not pa&s;t controver&s;y, whether God be better <HI>than Sin, and Glory better</HI> than Vanity? Why &s;hould&s;t thou for&s;ake thine own mer|cy, and &s;in again&s;t thine own Life? When wilt thou &s;hake off thy Sloth, and lay by thine Excu&s;es? <HI>Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to Morrow,</HI> thou knowe&s;t not where this Night may lodge thee, <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.1.</P>
<P>Beloved, now the holy Spirit is &s;triving wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>you:</HI> He will not always &s;trive. Ha&s;t thou not felt thy Heart warmed by the Word, and been almo&s;t per|&s;uaded to leave off thy Sins, and come into God? Ha&s;t thou not felt &s;ome good motions in thy mind, wherein thou ha&s;t been warned of thy Danger, and told what thy carele&s;s Cour&s;e would end in? It may be thou art like young <HI>Samuel,</HI> who when the Lord called once and again, he knew not the Voice of the Lord, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.6, 7. But the&s;e Motions and <HI>Items</HI> are the offers, e&s;&s;ays, calls and &s;trivings of the Spirit: Oh, take the Advantage of the Tide, and know the Day of thy Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>Now the Lord Je&s;us &s;tretcheth wide his Arms to receive you; he be&s;eecheth you by us. How mov|ingly, how meltingly, how pitifully, how pa&s;&s;ionate|ly he calleth! The Church is put into a &s;udden ex|ta&s;y upon the &s;ound of his Voice, <HI>The Voice of my Be|loved,</HI> Cant. 2.8. Oh, wilt thou turn a deaf Ear to his Voice?

<P>Beloved, I am loth to leave you: I cannot tell how to give you over: I am now ready to &s;hut up, but fain I would drive this Bargain between Chri&s;t and you, before I end. What! &s;hall I leave you as I found you at la&s;t? Have you read hitherto, and are not yet re&s;olved upon a pre&s;ent Abandoning all your Sins, and clo&s;ing with Je&s;us Chri&s;t!

I charge you before the Mo&s;t High God, that none of you be found a Swearer or a Lyat, or a lover of evil Company, or a Scoffer, or Malicious, or Cove|tous, or a Drunkard, or a Glutton, unrighteous in Dealing, unclean in his Living, or a Quarreller, or a Thief, or a Backbiter, or a Railer: For I de|nounce unto you, from the Living God, that De|&s;truction and Damnation is the End of all &s;uch, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20. <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6, 9, 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.19, 20, 21.</P>

Let every Family with you be a Chri&s;|tian Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.19. every Hou&s;e a Hou&s;e of Prayer: Let every Hou&s;holder &s;ay, with <HI>Jo&s;hua, I and my Hou&s;e will &s;erve the Lord,</HI> Jo&s;h. 24.15. and re&s;olve with <HI>David, I will walk within my Hou&s;e with a perfect Heart,</HI> P&s;al. 101.2.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let Religion be in your Families, not as a Matter by the by (to be minded at Lei&s;ure, when the World will give you leave) but the &s;tanding Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e: Let them have your Prayers as your Meals: Is there any of your Families but have time for their taking Food? Wretched Man! Can&s;t thou find Time to eat in, and not find Time to pray in?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Settle it upon your Hearts, that your Souls are bound up in the Souls of your Families. They are committed unto you, and if they be lo&s;t through your Neglect, will be required at your Hands. Sirs, if you do not, you &s;hall know, that the Charge of Souls is a heavy Charge, and that the Blood of Souls is a heavy Guilt. O Man! ha&s;t thou a Charge of Souls to an&s;wer for, and do&s;t thou not be&s;tir thy &s;elf for them, that their Blood be not found in thy Skirts? Wilt thou do no more for immortal Souls, than thou wilt do for thy Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h? What do&s;t thou do for thy Children and Servants? Thou provide&s;t Meat and Drink for them, agreeable to their Natures; and do&s;t thou not the &s;ame for thy Bea&s;t? Thou give&s;t them Medicines, and cheri&s;he&s;t them when they be &s;ick: And do&s;t thou not as much for thy Swine? More particularly.</P>

<P N="2"><PB N="165" REF="004663_0189_100DE1174B30DE40">2. Let every Per&s;on in your Families be duly called to an Account of their profiting by the Word heard or read, as they be about doing your own Bu&s;ine&s;s: This is a Duty of Con&s;cience un&s;peakable, and would be a Means to bring tho&s;e under your Charge, to re|member and profit by what you receive. See Chri&s;t's Example in calling his Family to an Account, <HI>Matt.</HI> 16.11, 13, 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. Often take an Account of the Souls under your Care, concerning their Spiritual E&s;tates; (herein you mu&s;t be Followers of Chri&s;t, <HI>Matth,</HI> 13.10, 36, 51. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.10, 11.) make Inquiry into their Conditions, in&s;i&s;t much upon the Sinfulne&s;s and Mi&s;ery of their natural E&s;tate, and upon the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration and Conver&s;ion, in or|der to their Salvation. Admoni&s;h them gravely of their Sins, encourage their Beginnings. Follow them earne&s;tly, and let them have no quiet for you, till you &s;ee them in a &s;aving Change. This is a Du|ty of high Con&s;equence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected. Doth not Con&s;cience &s;ay, Thou art the Man?</P>
<P N="4">4. Look to the &s;trict Sanctifying of the Sabbath by all your Hou&s;hold, <HI>Exod</HI> 20.19. <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.3. Ma|ny poor Families have little Time el&s;e.

Find but a Heart, and I will find Time. Pinch out of your Meals and Sleep, rather than want for Prayer. Say not, my Bu&s;ine&s;s will not give Leave. This is the greate&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ave thy&s;elf, and the Souls committed to thee. Bu|&s;ine&s;s, a Whet will be no Let. In a Word, the Ble&s;|&s;ing of all is to be got by Prayer, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.11, 12. 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 7 29. And what is thy Bu&s;ine&s;s without God's Ble&s;&s;ing?

<P N="6">6. Put every one in your Familes upon pri|vate Prayer. Ob&s;erve whether they do perform it. Get them the Help of a Form, if they need it, till they are able to go without it. Direct them how to pray, by minding them of their Sins, Wants and Mercies, the Materials of Prayer. This was the Practice of <HI>John,</HI> and of Je&s;us, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.1, 2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Set up Catechi&s;ing in your Families, at the lea&s;t once every Week.

Say not, they are carele&s;s, and will not learn: What have you your Authority for, if not to u&s;e it for God, and the good of their Souls? You will call them up, and force them to do your Work; and &s;hould not you at lea&s;t be as zealous in putting them upon God's Work? Say not, they are dull, and are not capable: If they be dull, God requires of you the more Pains and Patience; but &s;o dull as they are, you will make them learn how to Work; and can they not learn as well how to live? Are they capable of the My&s;teries of your Trade, and are they not capable of the plain Principles of Religion? Well, if ever you would &s;ee the Growth of Reli|gion, the Cure of Ignorance, the Remedy of Pro|fanene&s;s, the Downfall of Error, fulfil you my Joy in going thorough with this Duty.</P>
<P>Will you an&s;wer the Calls of divine Providence? Would you remove the incumbent, or prevent the impending Calamities? Would you plant Nur&s;eries for the Church of God? Would you that God &s;hould build your Hou&s;es, and ble&s;s your Sub&s;tance? Would you that your Children &s;hould ble&s;s you? O then &s;et up Piety in your Families, as ever you would be ble&s;&s;ed, or be a Ble&s;&s;ing: Let your Hearts and your Hou&s;es be the Temples of the living God, in which his Wor&s;hip (according to all the &s;aid mentioned Directions) may be with Con&s;tancy reverendly performed, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his Heart, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without Remedy.</HI> Oh! be wi&s;e in Time, that you be not mi&s;erable to Eternity.</P>

Heartily to love them that &s;light you, and to wi&s;h and &s;eek the good of tho&s;e that hate you, and &s;eek to hurt you: This is the very thing urged in the Text. <HI>If you &s;alute your Brethren, only, and love them that love you, do not even the</HI> Publicans <HI>the &s;ame?</HI> Matth. 5.46, 47. To love them that do re&s;pect and value us, this every one can do; but to love them truly that think meanly of us, and have Prejudices and hard Thoughts again&s;t us, and to &s;peak well of them that &s;peak Evil of us, (as the &s;weet-&s;pirited <HI>Calvin</HI>) Let <HI>Luther</HI> call me Dog or Devil, I will &s;ay of him neverthele&s;s, he is a precious Servant of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This is to do more than others. Thus the Martyr <HI>Cranmer,</HI> of whom it was a Proverb (Do the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury</HI> a Di&s;plea&s;ure, and you &s;hall ever have him your Friend.) Thus that Holy Man, in his much to be admired parting Words, (I had never any greater Plea&s;ure in all my Life than to forget and forgive Injuries, and to &s;hew Kindne&s;s to them that &s;ought Evil to me.) Study who have offend|ed you, and di&s;obliged you, and &s;lighted you, and keep up good Thoughts of them (if the Ca&s;e will bear it) and &s;peak nothing but good of them, and think what Kindne&s;s you may &s;hew them: <HI>Pray for them, wi&s;h well to them, &s;o &s;hall ye be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 5.45.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> II. To &s;wim again&s;t the Stream of the Multitude: The dead Fi&s;h will &s;wim with, but the Living, again&s;t the Stream. Many will tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Jews,</HI> when their Intere&s;t will carry it in the World. When Religion is in Fa&s;hion, every one will be in it. But to bear Head again&s;t the Cur|rent of the Times, and to be for &s;trict Godline&s;s in all your Ways, when the Stream runs quite a|gain&s;t it, to bear it down, and to re&s;olve as <HI>David</HI> did, <HI>to be yet more vile;</HI> this is to be, and to do more than others. The <HI>Samaritans</HI> will need be <HI>Jews,</HI> when <HI>Alexander</HI> favours and helps them;
<PB N="3" REF="004663_0194_100DE1B025A9B558">
but when <HI>Antiochus</HI> bloodily rages again&s;t them, (as in the Time of the <HI>Maccabees</HI>) then they will be none of the Kin, but pretend them&s;elves to be of another Stock (which, by the Way, was the Rea|&s;on of the deadly Hatred afterwards between the <HI>Jews</HI> and them.) But to be &s;ingular in your good Choice and Re&s;olutions, with <HI>Jo&s;hua;</HI> though all &s;hould vote again&s;t you with one Con&s;ent; and with <HI>Noah</HI> to be perfect in our Generation, when never &s;o adulterous, and to walk with God when all Fle&s;h have corrupted their Way, and tread a contrary Cour&s;e, this is to do more than others. Thus the three Children, or rather the three Champi|ons (who would not fear the Flouts of the Multi|tude, nor the Frowns of the great Ones, nor the Charge of Singularity, but when all the Princes, Governours, Captains, Coun&s;ellors, Sheriffs, and all the People, Nations and Languages fell down and wor&s;hipped, they &s;tood by them&s;elves, and would not &s;infully comply, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.3, 7, 18.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> III. To take mo&s;t care of that which is mo&s;t out of Sight. A Chri&s;tian's Eye is mo&s;t on the Things lea&s;t &s;een; fir&s;t upon his Heart, herein he doth exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Phari&s;ees, who&s;e great Care was to keep all fair and clean that came to view, but looked no farther: Make great Con&s;cience of your Carriage in &s;ecret, and let your main Guard be upon your Hearts, and this will be more than others reach to. This was <HI>Paul's</HI> Care, to keep his Con&s;cience, his In&s;ide, clean and undefiled, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.16. and <HI>Job's</HI> Care, that tho' all the World did reproach him, he might not put a Reproach in the Mouth of his Con&s;cience, <HI>Job</HI> 27.6. and <HI>David's</HI> Care that his Heart might be clean. 2. <HI>Upon his Hope.</HI> Others look to the Things <HI>&s;een,</HI> Things in Hand; but the true Believer eyes his <HI>Hopes,</HI> walks by <HI>Faith,</HI> not by <HI>Sight,</HI> and lives a quite different Life from many others in the World be&s;ides; as living upon the Hope of Heaven doth differ from living on the Plea&s;ures, Profits and Ho|nours of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004663_0195_100DE0082F0F9798"><HI>Rule</HI> IV. To be merciful to others Failings, and very &s;evere to our own. The noble Roman <HI>Cato,</HI> could more ea&s;ily forgive any than him&s;elf To aggravate our <HI>own Evils,</HI> and to have an Excu&s;e ready for our Brothers, and to cen&s;ure our&s;elves freely, and to come with the Mantle behind us to cover our Brother; this is to do more than others. The Hypocrite is a Cen&s;urer abroad; he is like the Eye that can &s;ee any thing but it&s;elf: He can di&s;cern a Mote in his Brother's Eye, but not a Beam in his own. But the Servant of God rebukes others with Meekne&s;s, but falls out ea&s;ily and bitterly with him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> V. <HI>To &s;uffer rather than to &s;in.</HI> This was <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> choice, but the Hypocrite is quite contra|ry: He choo&s;eth Iniquity rather than Affliction. To go &s;o far with Chri&s;t as our Way lies together, is to do no more than an un&s;ound Profe&s;&s;or may reach to: The Trial is when Chri&s;t's Intere&s;t and ours do cro&s;s, and we mu&s;t either baulk our Duty, or our Safety and Advantage. The famous Martyr under <HI>Julian,</HI> would not give one Half-penny to|wards the Building of the Idol's Temple, tho' he was offered his Life by the Emperor on tho&s;e Terms: The godly high Prie&s;t <HI>Eleazer,</HI> when the Nobles per&s;uaded him to eat other Meat under Colour of Swine's Fle&s;h, and they would per&s;uade the King <HI>Antiochus</HI> that he had eaten Swine's Fle&s;h, would die rather than &s;tain his Profe&s;&s;ion with the Appear|ance of Evil. When a Man &s;hall lie in outward Mi&s;ery, and have a Door of Deliverance opened, if he would but &s;in, and yet he will not accept of it, as tho&s;e Worthies in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Martyrology: This is to do more than others, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.36.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VI. <HI>To rejoice for Lo&s;&s;es in Chri&s;t, and glory in the Cro&s;s.</HI> When others be di&s;couraged at the News of Hard&s;hip, as that forward and &s;eemingly re&s;olved Di&s;ciple, or &s;hall be offended as &s;oon as the Sun of Per&s;ecution is up. When we &s;hall take plea&s;ure <HI>in Infirmities, in Tribulations,</HI> and rejoice
<PB N="5" REF="004663_0196_100DE1B2D9E40D40">
that we are <HI>counted worthy to &s;uffer</HI> Shame for the Name of Chri&s;t; this is to do more than others. When the Servants of God &s;hall not only <HI>patiently and triumphantly</HI> undergo the Cro&s;&s;es that crack the Brains, and break the Hearts of others, and &s;hall &s;hake off the Viper without receiving any hurt, when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> &s;hall &s;ing in the Stocks, and the re&s;olved Martyr &s;hall embrace the Faggots, and ki&s;s the Stake: When the valiant <HI>Philpot</HI> &s;hall &s;ay of his Pri&s;on (In the Judgment of the World we are in Hell, but I find in it the &s;weet Con&s;o|lation of Heaven) and the Holy <HI>Bradford</HI> (My Pri&s;on is &s;weeter to me than any Parlour, than any Plea&s;ure I have had in all my Life.) This is indeed to exceed others.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VII. <HI>To be good when we &s;hall be evil &s;poken of for our Labour.</HI> A <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> will do tho&s;e Duties that will gain Applau&s;e with Man, but to take up with de&s;pi&s;ed Duties, di&s;graceful Duties, and with <HI>Davia</HI> to be religious, when it &s;hall render him vile: This is to do more than others. The Philo|&s;opher could &s;ay, <HI>It is noble indeed for a Man to do Well, when he knows he &s;hall bear Ill for it.</HI> To take up Religion when every one kicks it off, to &s;tand up alone with <HI>Luther</HI> for the Truth, when the whole World is gone a Wandering after the Whore. To have his Hand again&s;t every Man, and to be for Chri&s;t with <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> again&s;t the whole Uni|ver&s;e: This is indeed to do &s;ome &s;ingular Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VIII. <HI>To &s;trike in with God's Intere&s;t when it is falling.</HI> To join our&s;elves with the Lord's People, when it is the weake&s;t, to e&s;pou&s;e their Intere&s;t with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when they were in deep Af|fliction, <HI>Heb</HI> 11.25, 26.

<P>Q. I. <HI>When others do pick and choo&s;e, have you re|&s;pect to all God's Commandments?</HI> The Hypocrite may have great re&s;pect to the Comforts, but he hath little to the Commands of Religion: He is much for the Privilege and Promi&s;es: little for the Pre|cepts and Duties: He is partial in the Law; he will take but here and there where he likes, and where God's Commands will &s;erve his Intere&s;t, or at lea&s;t will not pinch too hard upon the Fle&s;h. The &s;ound Chri&s;tian &s;ets all God's Commands be|fore him; he eyes all his Copy; and heartily de|&s;igns and &s;tudies a throughout Conformity: He hath no &s;tarting Holes, no contrived Haunts; nor doth he halt between the Lord and <HI>Baal,</HI> nor &s;erve two Ma&s;ters: He doth not fear the Lord, and &s;erve other Gods, nor divides his Service be|tween God and Mammon, but he is all for Uniformity and entirely devoted to God's Service, and Fear alone; he hath a good Con&s;cience willing in all Things to live hone&s;tly, and doth truly, though not perfectly for&s;ake all his Sins, and keep all his Statutes that are known to him. Let me therefore ask you two Que&s;tions: (1. When others divide the Tables, do you &s;weetly conjoin them in your Practice?

The righteous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s; he de&s;ireth Truth in the inward Parts, and takes infinite Com|placency in the Graces of his People. The&s;e are the Spikenard and Saffron, the Spices, the Beds of Lillies; the &s;weet Ointment that Chri&s;t is &s;o taken up with: The&s;e are the Cinnamon and the Trees of Frankincen&s;e; the Calamus and Camphire, the Myrrhe and the Aloes; the Chains of the Neck, and the precious Pearls, that he is &s;o ravi&s;hed withal, and doth &s;o &s;uperlatively commend, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.9. This is the Raiment of Needle-work, and Gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> wherein the Queen is pre&s;ented to her Royal Husband, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 45.9, 3. Therefore as the Elect of God, Holy and Beloved, <HI>Col.</HI> 5.12, 13.

let me commend to you &s;ome &s;pecial Graces which God doth manife&s;t him&s;elf to be wonderfully plea|&s;ed withal. As ever you would plea&s;e God, get on the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Be clothed with Humility,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is a Garment which mu&s;t be put on, or el&s;e you can|not be accepted or &s;aved, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.3. Here is the Dre&s;s that you mu&s;t come to God in: He mu&s;t be <HI>&s;erv'd in humility of Mind,</HI> Acts 20.14. You mu&s;t humble your&s;elves to walk with him, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.8. Humility is a plain, but yet a comely Garment: This Grace doth eminently honour God; and there|fore God doth put a peculiar honour upon, and manife&s;t a mo&s;t &s;pecial Delight in this: Of all the Men in the World, this is the Man that God will look unto; even he that is pure, and of a con|trite Spirit, that trembleth at his Word, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 66.2. Though he be the high and lofty One, who in|habiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is holy: From whence the trembling Soul is ready to conclude, that &s;urely &s;uch a fearful Maje&s;ty cannot but de|&s;pi&s;e him; &s;uch &s;in-hating Purity cannot but abhor him; yet he will lay, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 47.15, a&s;ide his Ma|je&s;ty, and bear with Man's impurity, and conde|&s;cend to mo&s;t familiar and con&s;tant Communion and Cohabitation with his poor Du&s;t, when contrite at his Feet, and pro&s;trate in Humility: If thou would|e&s;t be accepted of God, come as <HI>Benhadad</HI>'s Servants to the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with a Rope about thy Neck, and A&s;hes on thy Head, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.32. think mean|ly on thy &s;elf, and God will honour thee, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.30. Put thy &s;elf in the lowe&s;t Rooms, and God will &s;et thee higher: Be little in thine own Eyes, and thou &s;halt be high in his: A proud Heart and a proud Look is with God the fir&s;t-born of Abomi|nation: As ever thou would&s;t have God well plea|&s;ed with thee, be throughly di&s;plea&s;ed with thy&s;elf. If thou do&s;t throughly loath thy &s;elf, God doth love thee, if thou abhorre&s;t thy&s;elf, God delighteth in thee: Be angry with thy &s;elf, and the Almighty
<PB N="18" REF="004663_0209_100DE1D3BA2CAB70">
will turn away his Anger from thee: Condemn thy&s;elf, and God will acquit thee. In no wi&s;e extenuate thy Sins, nor ju&s;tify thy&s;elf. Think the wor&s;e of thy&s;elf and be willing that others &s;hould think meanly of thee, and heartily love them that &s;light thee. This is the Frame in which God is well plea&s;ed: Pa&s;s Sentence on thy&s;elf, and God will ab&s;olve thee: Set thy&s;elf at his Foot-&s;tool, and he will lift thee up into the Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Labour for &s;incerity.</HI> This is not a di&s;tinct Grace from the re&s;t, yet for Doctrine-&s;ake I &s;peak to it di&s;tinctly. Uprightne&s;s is the great thing that God looks after, and covenants for, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. It renders all our Per&s;ons and Performances accepta|ble before God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.8. Such as are upright in the Way, are God's delight, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11 20. To the&s;e are all the Promi&s;es of Peace, Salvation, Par|don, Pre&s;ervation, Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 87.10. In a Word, there is <HI>no good thing God will withhold from them that walk uprightly,</HI> Prov. 28.10. This was <HI>Noah</HI>'s Prai&s;e that he was upright <HI>in his Genera|tion.</HI> This was that which &s;et off <HI>Job</HI> at &s;uch a Rate, that God doth &s;o extol him for, and as it were, makes his Boa&s;t of him: The &s;ingular &s;incerity and integrity of his Heart. Study to be upright: that the main bent of your Hearts be to plea&s;e God, and honour him; that God's intere&s;t be up|permo&s;t with you; that he hath the chief Share in you, and the Eye of the Soul be principally to him; for in this &s;incerity doth con&s;i&s;t, as to your State. Let your great care be your Heart; here is a Chri&s;tian's great Work. The Lord &s;eeth not as Man &s;eeth, for Man looketh on the outward Ap|pearance, but the Lord looketh to the Heart; &s;ee therefore that thou look to it. Let thine Eye be chiefly there where God's Eye is. He looketh not &s;o much what thou do&s;t, as with what a Heart go then and do likewi&s;e. Yet be not &s;atisfied in this, that you are upright as to your State, but labour to
<PB N="19" REF="004663_0210_100DE1D627A2E190">
approve your&s;elves in Uprightne&s;s to God in &s;piri|tual Actions. Do common, as well as &s;piritual Actions, with holy Ends. Much of our Lives are lo&s;t for want of this. So much is done for God; of his &s;trange Grace, he accounts him&s;elf our Deb|tro. But what is done for no higher End than Self, is lo&s;t from our Account.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Put on a Spirit of Zeal and Activity.</HI> How wonderfully is God plea&s;ed with <HI>Phineas</HI>'s Zeal <HI>Numb</HI> 15 11, 12, 13, What great Approbation doth he manife&s;t of him? What Atte&s;tation doth he give to him? He is &s;o greatly plea&s;ed with his zealous Appearance for him, that he turns away his Di&s;plea&s;ure from the whole Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and overlooks their Crim&s;on Provocations again&s;t him: On the contrary, there is nothing that God is more di&s;plea&s;ed with, than the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and lifele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and indifference in Religion. The Luke-warm Water is not a greater Offence to the Stomach, than the Luke-warm Profe&s;&s;or is to God: And therefore he will Spew &s;uch a one out of his Mouth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.16. Chri&s;tians, where is your Zeal for the Lord of Ho&s;ts? Chri&s;t's redeemed mu&s;t be zealous of good Works, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. not &s;lothful in Bu&s;ine&s;s, but fervent in Spirit, &s;erving the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 18.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12, 11. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.6.7. in&s;tant|ly Night and Day for the hope of the Promi&s;e. Do not only that which is right in the &s;ight of the Lord, but do it with all your Heart; the Lord loveth a willing Servant: Be&s;tir your&s;elves for the Lord. Be ye followers of Chri&s;t, who went up and down doing good. Every Chri&s;tian &s;hould be a common Ble&s;&s;ing, a publick Good. This is to be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, who is good unto all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works. And be &s;ure the Father doth be&s;t love that Child that is mo&s;t like him. A private narrow Spirit is a low and a ba&s;e Spirit, unworthy of a Chri&s;tian. A Catholick communicative Spirit is full of great De&s;ires, and
<PB N="20" REF="004663_0211_100DE1D9708CE8C8">
great De&s;igns: A large Heart &s;et upon doing good, who&s;e Fire, though ever hotte&s;t within, will be breaking forth of his Brea&s;t and provoking others; who&s;e Love will not be confined to a Party, but gladly and thankfully owneth Chri&s;t wherever he &s;ees him: This Catholick Spirit, I &s;ay, is the Glo|ry of Religion, the Church's Ble&s;&s;ing, and God's Delight.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Live by Faith,</HI> Heb. 10.38. This is a preci|ous Grace in God's Account, 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 1, 1. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1.7. It giveth Glory to God, and therefore God taketh no &s;mall plea&s;ure in it. By Faith <HI>Enoch</HI> obtains that Te&s;timony, that he plea&s;ed God, <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.20. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.5. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 4 18. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.39. <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.10.11. If you would &s;o walk as to plea&s;e God, you mu&s;t walk by Faith. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t look to the things un&s;een; they mu&s;t not live at the com|mon Rate. Chri&s;t mu&s;t be their Life and Breath, their Prayers and their Promi&s;es, their daily Bread. By Faith did the Elders obtain that good Report; 'twas Faith that Chri&s;t was &s;o greatly taken with in the <HI>Centurion,</HI> which made him to commend him for a <HI>none &s;uch.</HI> This was that which won &s;uch a &s;ingular Prai&s;e and Approbation from our Saviour to the Woman of <HI>Canaan;</HI> even her Victo|rious Faith, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.28. Thou ha&s;t taken away my Heart, my Si&s;ter, my Spou&s;e, thou ha&s;t taken away my Heart with one of thine Eyes, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.9. that is, with thy Faith. Live in the Power of Faith, and thou wilt plea&s;e him to the Heart, give Glory to him by believing. Let the Life that thou now live&s;t in the Fle&s;h, be by the Faith of the Son of God: Faith, as one well &s;ays, is the Navel of Morality.</P>
<P>Live by Faith in <HI>Pro&s;perity:</HI> Tho' thou ha&s;t the World about thee, let it not be above thee, keep it at thy Feet, u&s;e it as thy Servant: Be much in the views of Glory and Contemplation of Eternity: Buy as tho' thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t not, rejoice as tho' thou rejoice&s;t not, love as tho' thou love&s;t not, u&s;e this
<PB N="21" REF="004663_0212_100DE1DAF5C778A8">
World as not abu&s;ing it. It is but a Fa&s;hion, not a Sub&s;tance, and that which pa&s;&s;eth away, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.30, 31. U&s;e it therefore with mortified Affections, and prove the Sincerity of your Faith by the Victory over your inordinate Content and Delight in, and De&s;ires after, and Cares for, the Things of this World, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.4.</P>
<P>Live by Faith in <HI>Adver&s;ity:</HI> Weep as tho' thou wept not, enduring the Cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ing the Shame, as looking unto Je&s;us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2 <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.26. accounting Chri&s;t's Reproaches your Riches, his Shame your Glory, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.41. Compare the&s;e light Afflictions with the weight of Glory, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.18. Ply your Hearts with the Pro|mi&s;es; count if you can get the Riches that are laid up in them; roll your&s;elves upon the Lord, <HI>P&s;alms</HI> 37.1. and know that your Heavenly Father hath no greater Delight, than to &s;ee his Children tru&s;t him with Confidence, when all vi&s;ible Helps are out of &s;ight, and he &s;eems to be their Enemy, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.15.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Put on the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit;</HI> this is in the &s;ight of God of great Price: Study to be (1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3.3.) like your Father, &s;low to Anger, ready to forgive, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 130.1, 8. for|getting Injuries, loving Enemies, requiting Ill-will with Kindne&s;s, Ill words with Courte&s;ies, Neglects with Benefits; and if any wrong you, do him Kindne&s;s the &s;ooner; &s;o &s;hall you bear his Likene&s;s, and be his Delight: And know ye that are of unmortified Pa&s;&s;ions, and unbridled Tongues, God hath an e&s;pecial hatred and di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t a <HI>Froward Heart,</HI> and a Froward Tongue, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.32.1.20.1.12.8.12. Oh &s;eek Meekne&s;s: How can the Holy Dove re&s;t in a wrathful Heart? Chri&s;t is a Lamb of Meekne&s;s, how can he take Plea&s;ure in an unquiet and contentious Spirit! Verily, with the Froward, he will &s;hew him&s;elf froward, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 18.26. If you will nor forgive others, he will not forgive you. Art thou hard to be plea&s;ed,
<PB N="22" REF="004663_0213_100DE1DC89C62AB0">
a froward Wife, a froward Ma&s;ter, a cro&s;s and wil|ful Servant? Surely God will not be plea&s;ed with thee; he will mete to you as you Mea&s;ure to others, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Get a Spirit of Self denial.</HI> God is then plea&s;ed be&s;t, when Self is di&s;plea&s;ed mo&s;t. When we can be content to be empty, content to be aba|&s;ed, that God might be honoured, and with the Holy <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> are willing to be eclip&s;ed by Chri&s;t: willing to decrea&s;e that he may encrea&s;e; count|ing our&s;elves no Lo&s;ers, whil&s;t his Intere&s;t is a Gainer, <HI>John</HI> 3.29, 30. rejoicing that we are made low for Chri&s;t's Advancement; this is well-plea&s;ing unto God; how greatly was he plea&s;ed with <HI>So|lomon's</HI> Self-denying Choice, and gives him his Asking, throwing in Riches, and Honour into the Bargain? 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 3.10, 11, 12. Strange was <HI>A|braham</HI>'s Self-denial. What? to &s;acrifice with his own Hand, the whole Hope of his Family? the Heir of Promi&s;e! the Child of his Years! a Son! and only Son! wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his Life was bound up in the Lad's Life! Was ever Mortal thus put to it? But <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;hall not be a Lo&s;er. God gives him a Te&s;timony from Heaven, ble&s;&s;es him, ble&s;&s;es his Seed, ble&s;&s;es all Nations in him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.15, 16, 17, 18. Wonderful was <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his <HI>Self denial,</HI> but more wonderful was his Acceptation and Reward, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.24. None like <HI>Mo&s;es, Deut.</HI> 34.20 God preferreth him in another manner than <HI>Pharoah</HI> could. He mu&s;t &s;peak with him Face to Face, as a Man with his Friend; his Word &s;hall be as it were a Law with God. Speak for whom he will, they &s;hall be &s;pared, though they &s;eem to be devoted to De&s;truction. But &s;peak again&s;t him who dui&s;t, he &s;hall be &s;ure to bear his Iniquity, <HI>Numb.</HI> 12.8. Forget Self: Renounce thine own Wi&s;dom, thine own Worthine&s;s, thine own Will: Bite in thy Pa&s;&s;ions, curb thine Appetite; bridle thy Tongue: This do, and thou &s;halt be gently accepted, and &s;hall find that God's Favour will infinitely reward

thee, for all the murmuring Oppo&s;itions, and di&s;|contents of thy Fle&s;h, which will be ready to be impatient to have the Reins held &s;o hard.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Maintain a Spirit of Re&s;olution and Con&s;tancy in the Ways of God,</HI> Heb. 10.38. This was the Renown of the three Worthies, <HI>Daniel</HI> 3. They feared not the Fiercene&s;s of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI> Rage, nor yet the Fire of the Furnace: All the World could not make them bow; and how gloriou&s;ly did God own them, and miraculou&s;ly evidence his Plea&s;ure in them: Stand your Ground. Re|&s;olve to live and die by &s;ub&s;tantial Godline&s;s. Cleave to the Lord with full Purpo&s;e of Heart. Let no Difficulties make you change your Station: Then &s;hall you be an Honour and a Plea&s;ure to the God that made you. Well then, would you know what Frame of Heart is plea&s;ing to God? Why, this <HI>Humble, Sincere, Zealous Active Frame, this Be|lieving, Meek, Self-denying, re&s;olved Frame,</HI> this is the Frame that is well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>As to your Performances,</HI> more briefly that tho&s;e may plea&s;e God, you mu&s;t heedfully look to the&s;e five things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they be done by the right Rule;</HI> which is God's Word: You mu&s;t not follow the Imagina|tions of your own Hearts, <HI>Numb.</HI> 15.39. You mu&s;t not do that which is right in your own Eyes; in all Sacred-Actions, you mu&s;t have God's Command to warrant you. You may not offer to God of that, of which you are not able to &s;ay, <HI>Thou require&s;t the&s;e things at our Hands,</HI> I&s;a. 1.12. In all civil Actions you mu&s;t have God's Allowance. Be &s;ure he will never accept that which his Word condemns; under pain of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, dare not to &s;et your Hands to what the Word forbids.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That they be done to the right End,</HI> which is <HI>God's Glory:</HI> How damnably did the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? How mi&s;erably did <HI>Jehu</HI> mi&s;carry? And both in Acts for the <HI>Matter commanded,</HI> for want of aiming at this End.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="24" REF="004663_0215_100DE1E45D7726E0">3. <HI>That they proceed from right Principles,</HI> (1.) <HI>Faith,</HI> without which, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. Prayer will not avail, except it be the Prayer of Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. We believe, and therefore we &s;peak. (2) <HI>Love:</HI> If we &s;hould give our Goods to the Poor, and Bodies to the Fire, and not from Love, it would profit us nothing; where the &s;lavi&s;h Fear of Hell only, or of the La&s;hes of Con|&s;cience, or the Love of Man's Prai&s;e, carries Men to Duties; where any other carnal Principle is Predominant in the Act, it cannot plea&s;e God. (3) <HI>Fear:</HI> We cannot &s;erve God acceptably, with|out Reverence and godly Fear, (no &s;lavi&s;h Fear) The Lord <HI>taketh Plea&s;ure in them that fear him,</HI> in them that hope in his Mercy. Ob&s;erve the happy mixture; where the&s;e two are conjoyned, that is a true filial Fear, Saith <HI>David, I will come to thy Hou&s;e in the Multitude of thy Mercy;</HI> (Behold his Faith) <HI>and in thy Fear will I wor&s;hip toward thy holy Temple;</HI> there is his Fear with Faith) <HI>Faith without Fear</HI> were bold Pre&s;umption: Fear without Faith is &s;in|ful De&s;pair; joyn them together and God is well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may be done in a right Manner;</HI> pre|paredly, not ra&s;hly and incon&s;iderately, in the Pre|&s;ence of &s;o dreadful a Maje&s;ty: Prudently, for lawful Acts may be &s;poiled and be done unlawfully, without con&s;ideration had to the Offence that may (in &s;ome Ca&s;es) attend them; yea holy Duties as well as common Actions may be turned into Sins, by being ill timed, and for want of a due attending the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. <HI>Holily;</HI> not <HI>ra&s;hly</HI> utter|ing any thing with our Months before God; but behaving our&s;elves as in his Sight: Heartily, not feignedly with our Lips going, when our Minds are gadding.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they be directed through the right Means, that is, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the only Way to the Father.</HI> Bring all thy Sacrifices to the High Prie&s;t, offer all upon

<P>There is a Generation who&s;e Religion is but a <HI>Sunday's Religion,</HI> which they put on and off with their <HI>Sunday's</HI> Clothes, and then they think God is fairly &s;erved for the Week; altho' God knows, that little they do then is but poorly done neither.

This &s;hews thee to be under the mortified Power of Self-love, and not to be the Lord's, for none of us liveth to him&s;elf, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.7.

I fear we are not aware of the fear|ful Evil that is in <HI>Self-&s;eeking;</HI> It is no le&s;s than jo&s;tling God be&s;ide the Throne, and &s;etting our|&s;elves in his Room. It is God's great Prerogative, and the proper Wor&s;hip that is due to Him as GOD, that he &s;hould be the la&s;t End of all the Operations of us his Creatures, and that all our Motions &s;hould terminate in him. Now, when we eye our <HI>own Commodity,</HI> and <HI>not God,</HI> and look to this more than unto GOD, we arrogate the Divine Prerogative to our&s;elves, and &s;et our&s;elves above him, which is no le&s;s than heinous Idolatry. And if it be &s;uch an heinous Sin to bow down to an Image, which is but the giving God's <HI>outward Wor&s;hip</HI> to the Creature, how much more to &s;eek and honour our&s;elves before <HI>GOD,</HI> which is to give his inward Wor&s;hip? which of all is the Prin|cipal, to the Creature: Oh! how many, that pa&s;s for good Chri&s;tians, will be found heinous Idola|ters? Becau&s;e they have &s;ought their own carnal Ends more than <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Glory.</HI> And many real Chri&s;tians, tho' they mainly de&s;ign <HI>GOD</HI> and his <HI>Glory; yet,</HI> in many particular Actions, contract great Guilt, by <HI>looking</HI> no higher than them&s;elves in what they <HI>do.</HI> I know <HI>you cannot</HI> be always thinking of <HI>God,</HI> yet I would have <HI>you</HI> never to forget what <HI>you</HI> have been taught; in the En|trance of every <HI>&s;olemn Action,</HI> to remember. <HI>GOD,</HI> and make him your End.

<P N="2">2. Where our <HI>Wearine&s;s</HI> in and <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> to Duties, is only <HI>gradual</HI> and <HI>partial,</HI> not <HI>plenary</HI> and <HI>prevalent,</HI> it is not &s;ufficient to conclude our &s;elves gracele&s;s: While the Twins are together in the Womb, and two Nations within our Bowels, there will be contrary Inclinations. The Fle&s;h will never &s;ay <HI>Amen,</HI> to a good Motion as &s;uch, but will be lu&s;ting again&s;t the Spirit, and will hang back when the Spirit puts forward, and pulls down when the Spirit bends upwards: So that while Corruption remaineth, there will be always a di&s;&s;enting Party, and continual Conflicts; from whence it is no Wonder there &s;hould ari&s;e &s;ome Wearine&s;s: Yet the <HI>Spirit</HI> is the prevailing Intere&s;t, and tho' oft times foiled, yet hath mo&s;tly the Ma&s;tery in the Combat, and carries it again&s;t the Fle&s;h, though not

But when it is the &s;ettled permanent and habitual Frame of the Mind, it is a Matter of que&s;tioning our Condition. The Holy P&s;almi&s;t under a De&s;ertion, was even almo&s;t per&s;waded to give over with Religion; but when he is him&s;elf, nothing is &s;o &s;weet, nothing is &s;o lovely and de&s;irable to him, as the Duties of Holine&s;s.

<P N="4">4.

For this argues there is nothing but Fle&s;h, that there is no contrary Principle in &s;uch a Heart. For if there were, the Spirit would at lea&s;t make Oppo&s;ition: This was the very Frame of tho&s;e un&s;anctified Sinners that counted the Sabbaths and Services of God an unprofitable Burden, a very Wearine&s;s, a Bondage not to be born, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.13. A gracious Heart, when under &s;uch a Di&s;temper, as that God's Service &s;eems a <HI>Wearine&s;s,</HI> is even weary of him&s;elf, whiles this is burden&s;ome, he is a Burden to him&s;elf.

main State is &s;afe. You know under a Di&s;temper, the Appetite may di&s;gu&s;t, and nau&s;eate the Food that a Man doth love above all other Meats when he is well, and &s;o it is here. Do you when you are your &s;elves reli&s;h more Sweetne&s;s in God's Service than in your Meats and Drinks? Are no Sweets &s;o delight|ful to you as Fellow&s;hip and Communion with God, when you can attain to it in Duties? Do you come away di&s;contented, becau&s;e you cannot meet with God? Is the Ground why your Countenances fall, and your Hearts be di&s;couraged, becau&s;e you have <HI>(with them)</HI> toiled and &s;pread the Net, and have not caught what you went for: becau&s;e you have no An&s;wer nor Income from God? If it be thus, it is a Sign your Hearts be &s;et upon God; and that you place the Happine&s;s and Comfort of your Lives in God; and &s;o that your State is &s;afe: Otherwi&s;e when there is a fixed Antipathy to Duties, and an habitual Di&s;like of them, and Contrariety to them, the Ca&s;e is very &s;ad.</P>
<P N="6">6. Where our <HI>Wearine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> is &s;uch as makes us to give over our Duties, &s;o as to live in the ordinary Neglect of them, it is a fearful Sign: But where notwith&s;tanding pre&s;ent Di&s;couragements, we hold on in the Performance of our Duties, and a humble waiting upon God, for Removal of our Difficulties, till we are brought to a better Frame; this argues well The Church her&s;elf may be greatly de&s;erted, but then &s;he gives not over Duties, but &s;eeks after her Beloved, and makes diligent Enquir|ing, and will not be at re&s;t until &s;he hath found him, but the Hypocrite gives up, and will not wait upon the Lord any longer.

<P><HI>Conclu</HI> 7. When our <HI>Wearine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> is &s;uch as makes us fall out with the Service of Chri&s;t,

and willing to ea&s;e our&s;elves of his Yoke, and to throw off his Burden: This is a bad Sign: But when we fall out with our&s;elves, and ju&s;tly and approve Chri&s;t's Ways and Service, it is well. Thus it was with <HI>Paul:</HI> He doth not quarrel with the Law, as too &s;trict and too &s;evere, nor think of breaking off his Bonds, and taking his Liberty, but he <HI>pleads</HI> for the Law, and greatly approves it, and commends it, and condemns the Backwardne&s;s of his own Nature, <HI>Rom,</HI> 7.12, 25. When Men are more willing to be rid of CHRIST's Burden, than of the Di&s;temper that makes it grievous, and ca&s;t about for Ea&s;e, by winding their Bonds, and not by bringing their Minds to them, it is a woful Di&s;covery of an un&s;ound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> And thus much for this Ca&s;e.</P>

We are at mi&s;erable Uncertainties for all outward Enjoyments; we know not how &s;oon we may be called to part with them all: Chri&s;tians, What do you mean?

What will you do in the Day of Vi&s;itation, when Extremity comes in upon you, if you have no A&s;&s;urance that God will receive you?

<P>Coun&s;. IV. <HI>Be not &s;atisfied with the Truth of Grace, but reach after the Growth.</HI> Do not think all is done, when you have attained the Evidence of Grace, but put on hard towards the Increa&s;e.

This wounds Reli|gion to the Quick, when it &s;hall be &s;aid of Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, The&s;e Men indeed, will pray like Angels, but for aught we can &s;ee, they are as peevi&s;h, and as touchy, as any other Men, and they are as hard in their Dealings, and make as little Con&s;cience of their Words, as others do. Beloved, think not Religion lies only, or chiefly, in praying, hearing, reading: No, you mu&s;t be throughout religious. Sirs, bring forth your Religion out of your Clo&s;ers into your ordinary Cour&s;e. Let there not be a Li&s;t of Holine&s;s on the Out&s;ide of the Cloth, but let Holine&s;s be woven into the Whole of your Conver|&s;ations.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That you &s;et up the &s;olemn Exerci&s;e of Catechi&s;ing Weekly among you:</HI> Methinks I would not que&s;tion. but that in every Godly Family there is a Care of the <HI>Catechi&s;m.</HI> But when Governors do only impo&s;e it in general upon their Families, and occa&s;ionally take an Account, I find little Progre&s;s is made:

Put them upon &s;ecret Prayer, provide Helps for them till they are able to go without them: Shew them often the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, and Conver&s;ion, and the Nature thereof. Put them in mind of the fearful Mi&s;ery of an unregenerate E&s;tate. Ask them often, Whether they are converted or not? Shew them the Danger of delaying in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Call them to an Account of their Proficiency by every Opportunity.</HI> If there be but a Sermon, or a Chapter read, let them give you &s;ome Account of it.

glad in the Opportunity to &s;hew it. Brethren, what hath your Religion co&s;t you hitherto? And for Shame &s;uffer not your &s;hrinking, and withdrawing to tell the World that you have not Love enough to Chri&s;t, to engage you to run any Hazard for him. Do you indeed love the Lord? Oh then, now re|joice and be exceeding glad, for never had you &s;uch an Opportunity, in all your Lives, to &s;hew your Love as now; for never were you called to adven|ture &s;o for him, and his Service, as now you be. Now re&s;olve, that if Religion will make you vile, you will be yet more vile; and let your Zeal and Re&s;olution for God be intended and heightned by Oppo&s;ition.</P>

Oh happy and ble&s;&s;ed Meeting! Chri&s;tians, do not forget your Errand; remember where you are, and what you are come for, and know that you are upon the &s;olemne&s;t Tran&s;action that ever pa&s;&s;ed between the Creator and the Creature. It is God's admira|ble Conde&s;cen&s;ion, that he will be tied to us, and enter into Bonds with us, to ble&s;s us, and reward us. And becau&s;e our Faith is weak, he hath brought his Surety with him, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is a Surety on his Part, as well as ours, to undertake for the fulfilling of the Pro|mi&s;es. And he hath brought the vi&s;ible Signs, and Pledges by which all &s;hall be firmly pa&s;t and ratified before your Eyes. <HI>This is the New-Te&s;tament in my Blood,</HI> Luke 22.20.

of our pre&s;ent Capacity) yea, it comprehends infi|nitely more than can be &s;aid or thought. Why now this is the Covenant of Grace, which God e&s;tabli&s;hes with you this Day; that he will be a God All &s;ufficient to you.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, rou&s;e up your Faith: Now appropri|ate and apply the Promi&s;es: Now believe &s;trongly, and &s;tedfa&s;tly, and Believing will fill you with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory. I do not wonder if your Faith be put to it in &s;o high and great a My&s;|tery; to draw nigh to infinite Maje&s;ty, and con&s;ider|ingly and without He&s;itancy to &s;ay, <HI>Thou art mine and all that thou ha&s;t;</HI> this is no ea&s;y thing. But thou maye&s;t not dare to doubt it: Can&s;t thou que&s;tion him who is the Truth? Can the Strength of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> lie, or in his Word deceive thee? But the Soul is ready to reply, Oh the Things are too high and too great for me to pre&s;ume to believe, and is ready with <HI>Peter</HI> a&s;toni&s;hed, to cry out, <HI>Depart Lord, for I am a &s;inful Man.</HI> But why doth thine Hand trem|ble and thine Heart fail thee: And thy Feet (with <HI>Peter</HI>'s when walking on the Waters) begin to &s;ink? What do&s;t thou &s;tick at? Is it at the Truth of the Promi&s;e? No, &s;aith the trembling Soul, but &s;ure &s;o much can never belong to one &s;o &s;inful. I am afraid it is not mine. Why, what &s;aith the Promi&s;e? <HI>Only be upright.</HI> What though thou ha&s;t an hundred Failings, yet thy Heart is upright: The Bent of thy Heart is mainly for God and Holine&s;s; thou make&s;t Con&s;cience of all Sin, little as well as great, &s;ecret as well as open; and do&s;t thou deliberately allow thy&s;elf in any: Thou doe&s;t in the &s;ettled Frame of thy Heart prefer the Plea&s;ing of God, and value his Favour and Fellow&s;hip above all worldly Good; therefore thou art upright: The&s;e Marks are infal|lible. What, do&s;t thou object thy Failings? Art thou under a Covenant of Works? Do you think God now &s;tands upon Perfection? The Covenant is plain: God accepteth of Uprightne&s;s: And God hath wrought in thee that Condition that he requires
<PB N="71" REF="004663_0262_100DE263994F6A78">
of thee. What can be more plain? Wilt thou &s;uf|fer the Devil and Unbelief to catch the Bread out of thy Hand, when God tells thee it is thine? Wilt thou be again&s;t thy&s;elf, and refu&s;e thine own Peace, when God is come to &s;eal thee up to the Day of Redemption? This is that which the Lord here &s;eals to thee, <HI>That he will be God All-&s;ufficient to thee.</HI> O believe and be thankful, and rejoice in thine own Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s! Oh happy, thrice happy Souls, whom the living God thus &s;ignifieth and &s;ealeth to, and a&s;&s;igns over all his infinite Perfections as its ever|la&s;ting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Art. III. <HI>That he will di&s;charge you from all your Debts,</HI> Heb. 8.10, 12. <Q>This the Covenant, I will be merciful to their Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.18.

<PB N="76" REF="004663_0267_100DE270CC570308">
&s;ure you are now on Earth? So &s;ulely &s;hall you be in Heaven: The Lord intendeth you but for a very little while in this lower Region, you mu&s;t dwell above; where Chri&s;t is, there you mu&s;t be al&s;o. As &s;ure as you now &s;ee a crucified Chri&s;t, &s;o &s;urely &s;hall you &s;ee a glorified Chri&s;t. The Lord Je&s;us doth anticipate his Sentence here, and calls to you Gue&s;ts; <HI>Come ye Ble&s;&s;ed, inherit the Kingdom.</HI> Take the Writing, behold the Seals, there are the Conveyances of the Kingdom. The Donation is &s;ure and full, unalterable, irrevocable.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, Do you believe? If you do me-thinks you &s;hould be ravi&s;hed: Me-thinks you &s;hould be filled with Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory! But do you &s;tagger at the Promi&s;e, through unbelief? Do you &s;ay, O it is to much, and too great? Why, how can this be? What, too great for God to make good? Thou dare&s;t not think &s;o. But it is too great for me to think upon. Why, but Man, do&s;t thou not bear upon thee the <HI>Mark of the Lord Je&s;us; Who&s;e Image and Super&s;cription is this?</HI> Doth not your very Heart prize Chri&s;t above all the World? Ha&s;t thou not made a deliberate Choice of him, for thy head and Husband? Ha&s;t thou not entered into a &s;olemn Contract with him, to be his in all Times and Con|ditions, and love, honour, and obey him, before all others to the Death? And doth not thy Heart &s;tand to all his choice? Ha&s;t not thou taken him with his Yoke, and with his Cro&s;s? And do&s;t not thou in thy Pra&s;tice fir&s;t &s;eek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof? And ha&s;t not thou cho&s;en the Way of the Kingdom? Art thou not in Love with the Holine&s;s? And de&s;ire&s;t Grace more than Gold? Do&s;t not thou prefer an Holy Spiritual Life, before all the Grandeur of the World, and Plea&s;ure of the Fle&s;h? And all this not only for a Fit or Fla&s;h, but in the &s;ettled Frame and Di&s;po&s;ition of thy Heart? Surely thou mu&s;t wrong God and thy &s;elf, if thou denie&s;t it to be thus with thee. Why the&s;e are the Marks <HI>of the Lord Je&s;us</HI> upon thee, the &s;ure Marks:
<PB N="77" REF="004663_0268_100DE2737533BC58">
Fear not, the&s;e cannot deceive thee: The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evidence that thou art born of God, that thou art a Son, and &s;o an Heir; and therefore lay claim to the Inheri|tance.</P>
<P>Come then, Beloved Chri&s;tian, be of good Com|fort, why &s;hould&s;t thou doubt? Thou ha&s;t the Mark of the Sheep, and therefore thy Portion &s;hall be at the Right Hand, thy Sentence among the Ble&s;&s;ed. Well then, receive this Holy Sacrament as the Pledge of all this. Go home and look over all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ed Promi&s;es, and count them thine. Do not read them (as too often heretofore) as if they did not concern thee. Remember what GOD hath here promi&s;ed under Hand and Seal to thee, and let not all be left behind thee, when thou goe&s;t hence, but let the Remembrance, the Fruit and Sweet of this abide upon thee whil&s;t thou ha&s;t a Day to live. Never forget what the Lord hath here &s;poken to thy Soul: Make more of the Promi&s;es than ever in thy Life before: Ble&s;s thy &s;elf in them. Remember how the Lord <HI>delivered thee</HI> the Promi&s;es: How he &s;ealed to the &s;everal Articles, how he &s;prinkled the Blood upon the Book of the Covenant, and gave it thee, and &s;aid, <HI>This is the New Te&s;tament in my Blood:</HI> Oh live henceforth a Life of Joy and Faith, as a Man that is elevated above the World. Do not live at the old, dull and &s;lothful Rate, carry it like a Believer; and in a Word, walk as one that doth in|deed take all for Truth that the Lord hath &s;poken to thee this Day. Let that of the Apo&s;tle be a Clo&s;e to all, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Having therefore the&s;e Promi&s;es, Dearly Beloved, let us clean&s;e our &s;elves from all Filthine&s;s, both of Fle&s;h and Spirit. Perfecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>

<L>REader, who'ere thou art do&s;t chance to look,</L>
<L>Ble&s;s God directed thee to &s;uch a Book:</L>
<L>Be &s;erious when thou reade&s;t: 'tis no drull,</L>

<L>This Book needs no <HI>Commendum,</HI> for no <HI>doubt,</HI></L>
