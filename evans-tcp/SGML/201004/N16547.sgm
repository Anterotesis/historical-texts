this &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve a union of thirteen States, or &s;up|port a national government? It had no authority, its powers expired at the peace, became a dead letter, for the fear of common danger was gone. Peace, which to other nations pro|duces, and which under other circum&s;tances would have pro|duced to us, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, was pregnant with the greate&s;t evil; di&s;union, the certain parent of internal quarrels, di&s;order, and blood-&s;hed. In this &s;ituation of America, &s;ome of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of her citizens, lamenting that the term of her glory was &s;o &s;hort, and dreading the fatal con&s;equences which would nece&s;&s;arily follow from di&s;union, propo&s;ed that a Convention of the States &s;hould be called for the purpo&s;es of amending the Confederation. The wi&s;dom of the mea&s;ure was in&s;tantly &s;een: It was approved by Congre&s;s, recommended to, and adopted by the States.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands agreed, that an abler or more upright A&s;&s;embly never met in America, than the late Convention held at Philadelphia. The original de&s;ign of their meeting was to amend the pre&s;ent Articles of Confederation: But upon con|&s;ulting together; upon accurately inve&s;tigating the Confedera|tion, and informing each other of the real &s;ituation of their re&s;pective States, they &s;aw &s;o many radical defects in the one, and &s;o many alarming appearances in the other, as induced them readily and unanimou&s;ly to modify the Federal Con&s;ti|tution: And after four months &s;pent in painful inquiries, and diligent labour, produced the frame of government now offered to the con&s;ideration of the citizens of America. A form of government, which the Pre&s;ident of the Convention, with the mode&s;ty peculiar to him, acknowledges to be in &s;ome re&s;pects defective; but which he likewi&s;e tells us, <Q>was the re&s;ult of a &s;pirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conce&s;&s;ion which the peculiarity of our political &s;ituation rendered in di&s;pen&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021264_0004_0FB2B7DF0951BE00">WHEN we take a view of the re&s;pectable names who met upon this occa&s;ion, and compo&s;ed this plan of government, we ought to approach it with deference and re&s;pect. Though not in &s;uch a manner as to deprive us of the power of di&s;covering its faults; yet with &s;uch liberality as will lead us to con&s;ider it as the re&s;ult of the deliberations of good and able men, actu|ated by ju&s;t motives, and governed by pure principles. Men not &s;wayed by &s;elfi&s;h pro&s;pects, but urged to action by general philanthropy, and the de&s;ire of handing to po&s;terity the be&s;t form of Federal Government, that America is capable of re|ceiving, or perhaps that was ever offered to the con&s;ideration of mankind.</P>
<P>IF we read the propo&s;ed plan under the&s;e ideas, and think we di&s;cover imperfections, and faults; ought we not rather to di&s;tru&s;t our own perceptions, than the under&s;tandings of its makers? Becau&s;e it is much more probable, that a &s;ingle reader, even of great capacity, &s;hould be mi&s;taken, than that &s;o re&s;pectable a body as the Convention, with minds equally enlightened, and more unbia&s;ed, &s;hould, after the free&s;t and fulle&s;t inve&s;tigation of this important &s;ubject, be wrong.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am not one of tho&s;e who would adopt without con&s;ideration, or blindly pur&s;ue a plan produced by any body of men, however eminent their characters for wi&s;dom and virtue. "Not to pin my faith upon the &s;leeve of any man," was one of my earlie&s;t le&s;&s;ons. However, I am per&s;uaded that the work before us, requires no blind followers: but &s;tanding upon the ba&s;is of its intrin&s;ic merit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;trength &s;ufficient to with&s;tand the &s;hocks of its mo&s;t powerful enemies. Often have I read this work; and &s;ometimes di&s;covered, as I thought, important defects; yet upon doubting my own judgment, and reading it again, have generally found the fault in my&s;elf, not in the Con&s;titution. Yet I will not pretend to &s;ay that it is per|fect. Did perfection ever come from the hands of man? If
<PB N="6" REF="021264_0005_0FB2B7E04DD601E8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were perfect, it would be illy &s;uited to our imperfect capaci|ties. Government in it&s;elf is not a po&s;itive good; but &s;ome|thing introduced by &s;ocieties to prevent po&s;itive evil. The be&s;t frame of government is that which is mo&s;t likely to pre|vent the greate&s;t &s;um of evil. Such I apprehend is the go|vernment now under con&s;ideration. Had the de&s;ign of the Convention been to frame a Con&s;titution for any individual State, they might perhaps have produced one, in the ab&s;tract, &s;till nearer perfection. But far different was the purpo&s;e of their meeting! and I feel my&s;elf happy in concurring with that augu&s;t body in thinking, that it is the be&s;t government which could be obtained for the thirteen States of America. Under this impre&s;&s;ion I &s;hall attempt to explain tho&s;e parts of it which are, or have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be difficult; and to an&s;wer &s;ome of the principal objections which have been made to it.</P>
<P>BEFORE we enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the different articles which compo&s;e the Con&s;titution, it may not be improper to take into con&s;ideration the que&s;tion re&s;pecting a Bill of Rights; which many, from habit and prejudices, rather than from rea&s;on, and truth, have thought nece&s;&s;ary; and upon the want of it have founded one of their principal objections.</P>
<P>FEW people know the origin of the term; &s;till fewer have con&s;idered, without prejudice, the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing. What is a Bill of Rights? A declaration in&s;i&s;ted on by a free people, and recognized by their rulers, that certain principles &s;hall be the invariable rules of their admini&s;tration; becau&s;e the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e principles are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;er|vation of liberty. If this di&s;tinction be ju&s;t; can there be a difference, whether the&s;e principles are e&s;tabli&s;hed in a &s;eparate declaration, or are interwoven and made a part of the Con|&s;titution it&s;elf? Is an infringement of a Bill of Rights by the Governing powers, of more &s;erious con&s;equence, than an in|fringement
<PB N="7" REF="021264_0006_0FB2B7E36BD69860">
of the frame of government? The que&s;tion carries the an&s;wer along with it. That there is no di&s;tinction between them is a truth, an attempt to prove which would be an offence again&s;t common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>OF all the European governments a Bill of Rights is known I believe, to that of England alone. The cau&s;e of this is obvious. The liberty of that country has been procured and e&s;tabli&s;hed by gradual encroachments upon the regal powers &s;eized by, if not yielded to, the fir&s;t Prince of the Norman fa|mily. The fir&s;t declaration of this &s;ort found in the hi&s;tory of that government, is the Charter of Hen. the 1&s;t, obtained in con&s;equence of that Monarch's feeble title to the Throne. The frequent infractions of that Charter by Henry him&s;elf, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well as by &s;ub&s;equent Monarchs, produced the famous Magna Charta of John, which is generally con&s;idered as the founda|tion of Engli&s;h freedom. But in tho&s;e ages of darkne&s;s, when &s;carcely a rule of de&s;cent was fixed, much le&s;s principles in politics e&s;tabli&s;hed, Charters, or Declarations of Rights, were &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of, whenever intere&s;t induced, and circum|&s;tances offered opportunities to the Engli&s;h Princes, to infringe them.</P>
<P>The&s;e violations gave ri&s;e to the Charter of Hen. 3d, which was of much more importance than any of the preceding; and the di&s;contents and confu&s;ions which led to it, in the end gave birth to the Hou&s;e of Commons. From this period &s;ome ideas of liberty began to prevail in the nation, but which for a long cour&s;e of years were ob&s;cured by turbulent Barons, long and de&s;tructive civil wars, and the arbitrary government of an able line of Princes. The art of printing, the reformation, and the re&s;toration of letters, at length enlightened the minds of men: Ju&s;t ideas of liberty now prevailed, and the Commons &s;aw, that if the powers exerci&s;ed by the Tudors were to continue
<PB N="8" REF="021264_0007_0FB2B7E5B8D6FEB0">
in their new Sovereigns, all hope of liberty was at an end. Their re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit frequently &s;hewed it&s;elf during the reign of Elizabeth; but that prudent Prince&s;s had the addre&s;s to allay their fears, and the vigour to repre&s;s their &s;pirit. A new and foreign race of Princes now a&s;cend the Throne. The oppor|tunity was not to be lo&s;t: Political po&s;itions were laid down in, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Hou&s;e of Commons, which were con&s;idered by many as extraordinary, as they were true.</P>
<P>JAMES, without the tallents, affected to reign with as high an hand as the Tudors. Charles unfortunately for him&s;elf, had been educated in the prejudices of his father. His ill-advi&s;ed and arbitrary mea&s;ures, involved him in difficulties which pro|duced the Petition of Right in 1628. In this was &s;et forth the unalienable rights of Engli&s;h-men. New infractions produced new quarrels; which terminated in a total change of govern|ment. At the re&s;toration all was joy and fe&s;tivity. The tide of royalty ran too high, to think of Bills of Rights, or privi|leges of Engli&s;h-men. The conduct of James the 2d, the la&s;t King of that ill-fated family, involved the nation in fre&s;h di&s;|contents: The Prince of Orange is called to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The King quits the Kingdom: The Throne is declared va|cant; and William afcended it upon terms &s;tipulated in a Bill of Rights. It may be a&s;ked, why did the Engli&s;h con&s;ider a Bill of Rights nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of their liberty? The an&s;wer is, becau&s;e they had no written Con&s;titution, or form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution is no more than an a&s;&s;emblage of certain powers in certain per&s;ons, &s;ancti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied by u&s;age and defined by the authority of the Sovereignty; not by the people in any compact entered into between them and their rulers.</P>
<P>If at the revolution the Engli&s;h had fully marked out the go|vernment under which they cho&s;e in future to live, without
<PB N="9" REF="021264_0008_0FB2B7E841AC96C0">
contenting them&s;elves with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tabli&s;hing certain principles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bill of Rights, can there be a doubt, but that &s;uch frame of government would have &s;upplied the place of, and rendered unnece&s;&s;ary, a Bill of Rights?</P>
<P>FORMER Princes had pretended to a divine right of govern+ing: William acknowledged his to flow from the people, and previou&s;ly to his a&s;cending the Throne, entered into a con|tract with them, which recognized that ju&s;t and &s;alutary prin|ciple. Had the Engli&s;h at this time limited the regal power in definite terms, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying them&s;elves with a Bill of Rights, there would have been an end of prerogative: but they from habit were contented with a Bill of Rights, leaving the prerogative &s;till inaccurately defined, to claim by implifi|cation, the exerci&s;e of all the powers not denied it by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> declaration.</P>
<P>WHEN the United Netherlands threw off their dependence on the Crown of Spain and pa&s;&s;ed their act of Union, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought not of any Bill of Rights; becau&s;e they well knew tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the States General could have no right nor pretext to pa&s;s th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bounds pre&s;cribed by that celebrated act: So in the in&s;tanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before us, Congre&s;s have no right, and can have no pretext to pa&s;s the bounds pre&s;cribed them by this Federal Con&s;titution and the powers conceded to the Federal Government by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pective States, under this government, are as accurately defined, as they po&s;&s;ibly could have been in a Declaration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rights.</P>
<P>WHEN Independence was declared by the Americans, the had no government to controul them: Were free to chu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the form mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves. Six of the&s;e State have no Bill of Rights; wi&s;ely judging, that &s;uch declaration rend to abridge, rather than pre&s;erve their liberties. The
<PB N="10" REF="021264_0009_0FB2B7E9F8A71CE0">
con&s;idered their Con&s;titutions as the evidence of the &s;ocial compact between the governors and the governed, and the only proof of the rights yielded to the former. In all di&s;putes re&s;pecting the exerci&s;e of power, the Con&s;titution or frame of government decides. If the right is given up by the Con&s;ti|tution, the governors exerci&s;e it; if not, the people retain it. Each of the remaining &s;even States has a Declaration of Rights, adopted rather from habit ari&s;ing from the u&s;e in the Engli&s;h government, than from its being nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of their liberties.</P>

them, and that they enfeeble the State which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, they equitably con&s;idered five &s;laves only of equal con&s;equence with three free per&s;ons. What rule of federal taxation &s;o equal, and at the &s;ame time &s;o little unfavourable to the &s;outh|ern States, could the Convention have e&s;tabli&s;hed, as that of num|bers &s;o arranged? Suppo&s;e the value of the lands in the re&s;pective States had been adopted as the mea&s;ure: Let us &s;ee what then would have been the con&s;equence. The northern States are comparatively &s;mall to the &s;outhern, and are very populous; whil&s;t to the &s;outhward, the inhabitants are &s;cattered over a great extent of territory. Any given number of men in the latter States po&s;&s;e&s;s much greater quantities of land, than the like number in the former. It is true the lands to the north|ward &s;ell for a greater price than tho&s;e to the &s;outhward, but the difference in price is by no means adequate to the difference in quantity; con&s;equently an equal number of men to the &s;outhward would have to pay a much greater federal tax than the like number to the northward.</P>
<P>BY the 8th article of Confederation, the value of lands is made the mea&s;ure of the federal quotas. Virginia in con&s;e|quence is rated &s;omething above Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who&s;e num|ber of white inhabitants is nearly double.</P>
<P>AFTER all, this point is perhaps of no great con&s;equence The Congre&s;s probably will rarely, if ever, meddle with direct taxation, as the impo&s;t duties will in all likelihood an&s;wer al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the purpo&s;es of government, or at any rate the po&s;t-office which is daily increa&s;ing, and a tax upon in&s;truments of writ+ing, will &s;upply any deficiency.</P>

of the people. It is a generally received maxim among writers on government, that the Judiciary and Legi&s;lative de|partments &s;hould be kept di&s;tinct. The po&s;ition is true to a certain extent; but this like mo&s;t other general rules, is liable to exceptions. In the Engli&s;h government, which is certainly the free&s;t in Europe, the Hou&s;e of Lords not only try impeach|ments, but is the highe&s;t civil court in the kingdom. In that Con&s;titution the Hou&s;e of Commons are the impeachers, the Hou&s;e of Lords the triers: But no members either of the Hou&s;e of Commons or Hou&s;e of Lords, was ever impeached as &s;uch: But whenever members of either Hou&s;e have been impeached, it was as great officers of State. Under the fede|ral government this is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the members of nei|ther Hou&s;e can hold any office of State.</P>
<P>IF this rea&s;oning be not conclu&s;ive, the fourth &s;ection of the &s;econd article puts it out of doubt, viz. "The Pre&s;ident, Vice Pre&s;ident, and all civil officers of the United States, &s;hall be removed from office on impeachment, &amp;c." The Senators are repre&s;entatives of the people; and by no con&s;truction can be con&s;idered as civil officers of the State. If this be the ca&s;e, in who&s;e hands can this power be lodged with greater propriety, or with greater &s;afety, than in tho&s;e of the Senate? Or how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an a better court be appointed? To impeach either the mem|bers of Senate or Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, would be to im|peach the repre&s;entatives of the people, that is the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem&s;elves, which is an ab&s;urdity.</P>

<P>THIS power in the Pre&s;ident is derived from the State go|vernment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-York, though in the lat|ter the Chancellor and Chief Judges are added to the Gover|nor.

<P>IT is here to be ob&s;erved, that all taxes, impo&s;ts, &amp;c. are to be applied only for the common defence and general wel|fare, of the United States. By no po&s;&s;ibility will the words admit of any other con&s;truction. Yet &s;everal popular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in particular the addre&s;s and rea&s;ons, &amp;c. of the Penn|&s;ylvania Minority.</NOTE> de|claimers have attempted to &s;ound the alarm by their illeberal and ill-founded &s;ugge&s;tions of peculation, bribery, and cor|ruption, and of the probability of the public Trea&s;ury being converted to the u&s;e of the Pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s. But how will this be po&s;&s;ible? They will have all fixed &s;alaries, and perqui&s;ites. The public accounts of receipts and expenditures will be regularly kept and regularly publi&s;hed, for the public in&s;pection: Be&s;ides which, the public offices will always be open for the &s;earch and inquiries of every individual. I doubt if human wi&s;dom could devi&s;e any better mode of &s;ecuring a ju&s;t application of the public money.</P>
<P>AS &s;carcely any article of the propo&s;ed plan has e&s;caped cen&s;ure, there are objections made to the grant of the impo&s;ts to Congre&s;s. But when we con&s;ider that the purpo&s;es for which the impo&s;ts are to be applied are merely national, and falls di|rectly within the de&s;ign of the Union, that of making all Ame|rica one State for great political purpo&s;es, the objection falls; for in this view America compo&s;es but one great republic, all the &s;ubjects of which &s;tand preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame ground,

and pay only in proportion to their con&s;umption of foreign articles. To this we may add, that tho&s;e States which export the chief of the produce of their labour, and in con&s;equenec of that circum&s;tance, import more than tho&s;e which manufac|ture, receive a compen&s;ation for the increa&s;ed import, by the exported produce being free from duties. And be&s;ides, we may fairly conclude, that the con&s;umption of foreign articles throughout America, is nearly in proportion to the enumeration, which is the mea&s;ure of the re&s;pective quotas.</P>

<P>THIS power is lodged with the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal States, and with the Indian tribes;</HI></P>
<P>THE power of regulating commerce gives great alarm to the enemies of the Con&s;titution. In this, as in mo&s;t other in&s;tan|ces, they forget that this is a government for thirteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and think only of the immediate intere&s;ts of Virginia; as if &s;he had a right to dictate to the other twelve, and as if her intere&s;ts alone were to be con&s;ulted. Be not deceived my countrymen. However important we may be in the &s;cale of Union, there are other States which are equally &s;o. The con&s;equence of this power, &s;ay they, will be, that the ea&s;tern and northern States will combine together, and not only oblige the &s;outh|ern to export their produce in their bottoms, by prohibiting foreign bottoms; but will al&s;o lay &s;uch duties upon foreign manufactures as will amount to a prohibition, in order to &s;up|ply us them&s;elves.</P>
<P>UPON accurately inve&s;tigating this point, we &s;hall find the rea&s;oning to be as fal&s;e, as the &s;uppo&s;ition is illiberal. It is true the ea&s;tern States can build and equip &s;hips, upon better
<PB N="25" REF="021264_0024_0FB2B80C4DC85200">
terms than the &s;outhern: Nay, I believe I may go farther, and &s;ay, that they can upon better terms than any nation in Europe. This ari&s;es from their having all the materials for &s;hip-building within them&s;elves, except canvas and cordage, whil&s;t mo&s;t of the maritime powers of Europe, depend upon foreign countries, not only for the&s;e articles, but al&s;o for tim|ber and ma&s;ts. A great extent of &s;ea coa&s;t, a cold climate, a barren &s;oil, and above all, the fi&s;heries, furni&s;h an infinite num|ber of &s;eamen, who from nece&s;&s;ity are willing to navigate for very moderate wages. If this be the ca&s;e, is their any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the ea&s;tern States will not carry our produce upon as rea&s;onable terms as any of the European powers? I believe it is a fact, that before the war, they were the principal carriers to the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies; &s;o low were the terms upon which their ve&s;&s;els could be chartered. And the &s;ame cau&s;es &s;till ex|i&s;ts, why they &s;hould take freight upon terms equally moderate. But this is not all. The ea&s;tern States are not ignorant that the &s;outhern po&s;&s;e&s;s even better materials for &s;hip-building, than they do; and therefore will take care not to excite their jealou&s;y, nor &s;timulate them to build &s;hips and become their own carries, by exacting unrea&s;onable freightage. But ad|mitting that the ea&s;tern Delegates &s;hould be &s;o di&s;hone&s;t as well as unwi&s;e, to combine again&s;t tho&s;e of the &s;outh&mdash;I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that not a man in America, who is acquaint|ed with the middle States, can &s;uppo&s;e that they would join in &s;uch a combination. New-York is rather a country of far|mers than of &s;ailors: It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es large tracts of fertile &s;oil, but no fi&s;heries, and before the war, for one &s;hip built in that State, either for freightage or &s;ale, there were thirty in New-En|gland. All that &s;he will aim at, therefore, will be &s;hips of her own, &s;ufficient to carry her own produce. Her intere&s;ts, there|fore will not induce her to enter into this formidable combi|nation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021264_0025_0FB2B80E0B979720">JERSEY, from her local &s;ituation, and a variety of peculiar circum&s;tances, has fewer &s;hips and &s;eamen than even any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;outhern States. Her intere&s;ts, therefore, will lead her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o adhere to them.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to Penn&s;ylvania that does to New-York; and &s;till more emphatically; becau&s;e this State is &s;till more employed in hu&s;bandry. And as to the State of De|laware, it does not own &s;ix &s;hips.</P>
<P>LET us then &s;ee how this que&s;tion will &s;tand in point of numbers. The four ea&s;tern States will have &s;eventeen voices, which will be oppo&s;ed by the nineteen voices of the middle States and the twenty-nine of the &s;outhern.</P>
<P>I WILL not endeavour to an&s;wer the other objection.&mdash;The fear of a northern combination to furni&s;h the &s;outhern States with manufactures. This I conceive, has ari&s;en either from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnorance of the &s;ubject, or an ab&s;olute enmity to all confe|deration. The only manufactures which the northern States po&s;&s;e&s;s and with which they can furni&s;h others, are &s;hoes, cot|ton cards, nails, hats, carriages, and perhaps paper and refined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugars may be added; and &s;hould the whale-fi&s;hery be ever revived, train oil and &s;permacaeti candels. The two fir&s;t ar|ticles may be in a great mea&s;ure confined to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Their &s;hoes are as good and as cheap as tho&s;e imported from Great-Britain, at lea&s;t as the &s;ale &s;hoes. And as to the &s;econd article, the exportation of them from thence is prohibited by act of Parliament. Both New-York and Penn&s;ylvania manu|facture leather in all its branches, and hats; but not more than &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption. Connecticut has no manufactures to export; nor has New-York, unle&s;s perhaps &s;ome refined &s;ugar. Jer&s;ey has only dome&s;tic manufactures. Penn&s;ylvania manufactures nails, refined &s;ugar, cotton cards, carriages, and, of late, paper for exportation. The Dela|ware State has only dome&s;tic manufactures.</P>

There is no probability that either the nor+thern or &s;outhern States, will in many years become exten&s;ive manufacturers. The price of labour and cheapne&s;s of land will prevent it; and the daily migrations from all the States to the we&s;tern parts of America, will keep up the one, and keep down the other.

No preference &s;hall be given by any regulation of com+merce or revenue, to the ports of one State, over tho&s;e of another Nor &s;hall ve&s;&s;els bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to en+ter, clear, or pay duties in another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="021264_0033_0FB2B81DD822D158">ALL writers upon finance hold taxes upon exports to be im|politic. Yet there are doubtle&s;s &s;ome articles which will with propriety bear an export duty; &s;uch as tobacco and perhaps indigo. But then the&s;e articles are of the growth of only five of the States; and it would be a manife&s;t inju&s;tice that the pro|duce of &s;ome States &s;hould be taxed for the benefit of others. The latter part of the clau&s;e provides that all Naval Officers fees and port charges &s;hall be the &s;ame throughout the United States; and that a ve&s;&s;el bound to one State from another, and calling at any intermediate State, &s;hall not be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duty, in &s;uch State. This tends to faci|litate the intercour&s;e among the States, and may produce many commercial conveniencies.</P>
<P><HI>No money &s;hall be drawn from the Trea&s;ury, but in con&s;e|quence of appropriations made by law; and a regular &s;tatement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money, &s;hall be publi&s;hed from time to time.</HI></P>
<P>AS all appropriations of money are to be made by law, and regular &s;tatements thereof publi&s;hed, no money can be applied but to the u&s;e of the United States.</P>
<P><HI>No title of nobility &s;hall be granted by the United States:&mdash; And no per&s;on holding any office of profit or tru&s;t under them, &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s, accept of any pre&s;ent, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of this clau&s;e proves the Convention had no ari&s;tocratical views, nor any idea of e&s;tabli&s;hing an order in the State, with rights independent of the people. The latter part of it is introduced to prevent the officers of the Federal Government being warped from their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="021264_0034_0FB2B81F85780A28">Sect. 10. <HI>No State &s;hall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and repri&s;al; coin mo|ney; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and &s;ilver coin a tender in payment of debts; pa&s;s any bill of attainder, ex po&s;t facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.</HI></P>
<P>THE States, in their individual capacities, &s;hould be re|&s;trained from the exerci&s;e of the powers enumerated in this clau&s;e, for a variety of rea&s;ons. If any State &s;hould have a right of making treaties, granting letters of marque, and the like, America might be perpetually involved in foreign wars. By exerci&s;ing the right of coinage and of emitting bills of cre|dit, a State might, by the former, deba&s;e the currency of the United States, by mixing great quantities of alloy, and by that means defraud the Federal Trea&s;ury; and by the latter it might defraud not only its own citizens, but the citizens of other States. But this is not all. An exerci&s;e of the&s;e rights would materially interfere with the exerci&s;e of the like by the Congre&s;s; and therefore the particular, &s;hould give way to the general intere&s;t. The making any thing but gold and &s;ilver a tender in payment of debts, and the impairing the obligation of contracts, is &s;o great a political inju&s;tice, that the Con&s;titu|tion here requires of the States, that they will forever relin|qui&s;h the exerci&s;e of a power &s;o odious. This part of the clau&s;e would probably never have been introduced, had not &s;ome of the States afforded too frequent in&s;tances of unju&s;t laws upon the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><HI>No State &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of the Congre&s;s, lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports and exports, except what may be ob&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for executing its in&s;pection laws; and the nett produce of all duties and impo&s;ts, laid by any State on im|ports or exports, &s;hall be for the u&s;e of the Trea&s;ury of the Unit|ed States; and all &s;uch laws &s;hall be &s;ubject to the revi&s;ion and
<PB N="36" REF="021264_0035_0FB2B8227233AB58">
controul of the Congre&s;s. No State &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops, or &s;hips of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war; un|le&s;s actually invaded, or in &s;uch imminent danger, as will not admit of delay.</HI></P>
<P>IF the individual States might lay duties upon the imports, it would be counteracting the &s;ame right in Congre&s;s, and ruin the great fund out of which the pre&s;ent federal debts are to be paid, as well as the future federal expences defrayed. And with regard to exports, it was highly rea&s;onable that one State &s;hould be prohibited from laying an export duty on the articles of a &s;i&s;ter State, which may be &s;hipped through that State.</P>
<P>THE exigencies of the Union may however require direct taxes. By this clau&s;e, a door is open to the States, to rai&s;e their re&s;pective quotas, in lieu of direct taxes; by laying a duty upon exports; or even duties upon imports. But as the amount of the&s;e duties are to be paid into the public Trea&s;ury, no inconvenience can, on the one hand, ari&s;e to the general welfare from them; and, on the other, the power of revi&s;ion in the Congre&s;s will be the means of &s;ecuring a due attention to the intere&s;ts of all the States, in the mode of laying the du|ty, as well as in the application of it. The latter part of the clau&s;e is no more than a confirmation of principles antecedent|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and of powers before ve&s;ted in the Congre&s;s; but &s;uch as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the good order, dig|nity, and harmony of the whole; and are &s;uch as the States have already yielded to the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Article the 6th of the Confederation.</NOTE></P>

<P>Sect. 1. <HI>The Executive power &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a Pre&s;ident of the United States of America. He &s;hall hold his office during the term of four years, and together with the Vice-Pre&s;ident, cho|&s;en for the &s;ame term, be elected as follows:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Each State &s;hall appoint, in &s;uch manner as the Legi&s;lature thereof may direct, a number of Electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Repre&s;entatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congre&s;s: But no Senator or Repre&s;entative, or per&s;on holding an office of tru&s;t or profit under the United States, &s;hall be appointed an Elector.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Electors &s;hall meet in their re&s;pective States, and vote, by ballot, for two per&s;ons, of whom one at lea&s;t &s;hall not be an inha|bitant of the &s;ame State with them&s;elves.

<P>IT has been urged by many, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould be continued in office, only a given number of years, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e rendered ineligible. To this it may be an&s;wered, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat to be the ca&s;e, a good officer might be di&s;placed, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad one &s;ucceed. Knowing that he could not be continued, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e might be more attentive to enrich him&s;elf, &s;hould opportu|nities offer, than to the execution of his office. But as his con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inuance in office, will depend upon his di&s;charging the duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f it with ability, and integrity, his eligibility will mo&s;t pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ably be the be&s;t &s;ecurity for his conduct. The longer a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f abilities and virtue, fills an office, the better, and ea&s;ier <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the duties of it be di&s;charged: The whole &s;y&s;tem of ad|mini&s;tration becomes well arranged; and every department in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e government well filled. An election to this office once in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very four years, is a &s;ufficient curb upon the Pre&s;ident: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lectors hold the reins. If he has mi&s;conducted him&s;elf, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill not be re-elected; if has governed with prudence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bility, he ought to be continued.</P>
<P>THE Vice-Pre&s;ident will probably be a candidate to &s;ucceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Pre&s;ident. The former will therefore be a perpetual cen|nel over the latter; will be a &s;timulus to keep him up to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty, and afford an additional &s;ecurity for his upright conduct.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e rea&s;ons, and the powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecks oppo&s;ed to the powers of the Pre&s;ident, the enemies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Con&s;titution has &s;ounded the alarm with great violence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on the ground of his eligibility for life.

<P><PB N="39" REF="021264_0038_0FB2B828095626E8">IT is pretty certain that the Pre&s;ident can never become the &s;overeign of America, but with the voluntary con&s;ent of the people: He is re-elected by them; not by any body of men over whom he may have gained an undue influence. No citi|zen of America has a fortune &s;ufficiently large, to enable him to rai&s;e and &s;upport a &s;ingle regiment. The Pre&s;ident's &s;alary will be greatly inadequate either to the purpo&s;e of gaining adherents, or of &s;upporting a military force: He will po&s;&s;e&s;s no princely revenues, and his per&s;onal influence will be con|fined to his native State. Be&s;ides, the Con&s;titution has pro|vided, that no per&s;on &s;hall be eligible to the office, who is not thirty-five years old; and in the cour&s;e of nature very few fa|thers leave a &s;on who has arrived to that age. The powers of the Pre&s;ident are not kingly, any more than the en&s;igns of his office. He has no guards, no regalia, none of tho&s;e royal trappings which would &s;et him apart from the re&s;t of his fellow citizens. Suppo&s;e the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident &s;hould be continued for life: What expectations can any man in the Union have to &s;ucceed him, except &s;uch as are grounded upon the popularity of his character?</P>
<P>NONE of its citizens po&s;&s;e&s;s di&s;tinct principalities, from whence money may be drawn to purcha&s;e, or armies rai&s;ed to intimidate the votes.

<P>IT has al&s;o been objected, that a Council of State ought to have been a&s;&s;igned the Pre&s;ident. The want of it, is, in my apprehen&s;ion, a perfection rather than a blemi&s;h. What pur|po&s;e would &s;uch a Council an&s;wer, but that of dimini&s;hing, or
<PB N="40" REF="021264_0039_0FB2B82AF84EEAC0">
annihilating the re&s;pon&s;ibility annexed to the character of the Pre&s;ident. From the &s;uperiority of his talents, or the &s;uperior dignity of his place, he would probably acquire an undue in|fluence over, and might induce a majority of them to advi&s;e mea&s;ures injurious to the welfare of the States, at the &s;ame time that he would have the means of &s;heltering him&s;elf from impeachment, under that majority. I will here once for all ob&s;erve, that de&s;cended as we are from the Engli&s;h, conver|&s;ant as we are in the political hi&s;tory of that country, it is im|po&s;&s;ible not to derive both political opinions, and prejudices, from that &s;ource. The objectors probably con&s;idered, that as in the Engli&s;h government, the fir&s;t Magi&s;trate has a Council of State; there &s;hould be one al&s;o in the American. But they &s;hould at the &s;ame time have recollected, that the King of England is not per&s;onnally re&s;pon&s;ible for his conduct; but that her Con&s;titution looks up to his Mini&s;ters, that is, to his Council, to an&s;wer for the mea&s;ures of the Sovereign. But in the American Con&s;titution, the fir&s;t Magi&s;trate is the efficient Mini&s;ter of the people, and as &s;uch, ought to be alone re&s;pon|&s;ible for his conduct. Let him act pur&s;uant to the dictates of his own judgment; let him advi&s;e with his friends; let him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;ult tho&s;e of whom he has the highe&s;t opinion for wi&s;dom; but let not his re&s;pon&s;ibility be dimini&s;hed by giving him a Council.</P>

<P>THE powers ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident by this and the &s;ub&s;e|quent clau&s;e, belong, from the nature of them, to the Execu|tive branch of government; and could be placed in no other hands with propriety.</P>
<P>SO long as laws can not provide for every ca&s;e that may happen: So long as puni&s;hments &s;hall continue di&s;proportion|ate to crimes, the power of pardoning &s;hould &s;ome where exi&s;t.

<P>THE Pre&s;ident is the Repre&s;entative of the Union: The Senate the Repre&s;entatives of the re&s;pective States. The ob|jects of treaties mu&s;t always be either of great national import, or &s;uch as concern the States in their individual capacities; but never can concern the individual members of the State. Secrecy and di&s;patch are nece&s;&s;ary in making them: For with|out &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, they are &s;eldom made to purpo&s;e. Hence ari&s;es the impropriety of con&s;ulting either the Repre|&s;entatives

<P>IN the Dutch Republic the States-General are obliged to con&s;ult their con&s;tituents, upon this, as upon every important occa&s;ion, however urgent may be the nece&s;&s;ity. This vice in their Federal Con&s;titution has more than once brought them to the brink of ruin.</P>

Its enemies have mu&s;tered all their forces again&s;t the Federal Court; and have loudly &s;ounded the trumpet, for the benevo|lent purpo&s;e of alarming the good people of Virginia, with the fears of <HI>vi&s;ionary</HI> danger and imaginary oppre&s;&s;ion. They have told them the Federal Court, like Aron's rod, would &s;wallow up all the judiciary authority of the re&s;pective States. That a citizen of Virginia may be forced to Philadelphia for a debt of 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> although it was contracted with a fellow citizen: And, above all, that the trial by jury is not pre&s;erved. In a word, it is the Federal Court that is to be made the great in|&s;trument of tyranny.</P>
<P>THESE indeed would be &s;erious objections were they well founded.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands admitted, that a Federal Court is nece&s;&s;a|ry, for a variety of purpo&s;es, and under a variety of circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion then is, whether the enumeration of the ca&s;es a&s;&s;igned to the Federal Court, by this article, is likely to produce oppre&s;&s;ion? Or if there be any ground to appre|hend that Congre&s;s will not, by law provide a remedy for all probable hard&s;hips, and render the federal juri&s;diction conve|nient to every part of the United States?</P>
<P>THERE has been no objection rai&s;ed to the Federal Court having original juri&s;diction, in all ca&s;es re&s;pecting public Mi|ni&s;ters, and where a State may be a party; and the&s;e are the only ca&s;es wherein it has <HI>original juri&s;diction.</HI> In the&s;e ca&s;es, in controver&s;ies between two or more States, and between a State and citizens of another State, and between citizens of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame claiming lands under grants of different States, the pre|&s;ent

<P>THE Convention &s;en&s;ible of this defect, has wi&s;ely a&s;&s;igned the cognizance of the&s;e and other controver&s;ies to a proper tribunal, a Court of Law.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e controver&s;ies, there is but one po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e where a di&s;pute between two citizens of the &s;ame State can be carried, even by appeal, to the Federal Court; and that is, when they claim the &s;ame land under grants from different States. As their title is derived through States, this ca&s;e is preci&s;ely within the rea&s;on which applies to controver&s;ies wherein two States are parties.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this, we are told that in the mo&s;t or|dinary ca&s;es, a citizen of Virginia may be dragged within the appellate juri&s;diction of the Federal Court, although the tran&s;|action which gave ri&s;e to the controver&s;y originated between fellow citizens. This, it is &s;aid, may be effected, by a&s;&s;igning a bond, for in&s;tance, given by one fellow citizen to another, either to a foreigner or a citizen of another State. To this I an&s;wer, that &s;uch a&s;&s;ignment would not be attended with any &s;uch con&s;equence; becau&s;e it is a principle in law, that the a&s;&s;ignee &s;tands in the place of the a&s;&s;ignor; and is neither in a better nor a wor&s;e condition. It is likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted, that if two citi|zens of the &s;ame State claim lands lying in a different State,

This a&s;&s;ertion is equally groundle&s;s. For this being a local action, it mu&s;t be determined in the State where|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the lands lie.</P>
<P>AND I repeat it again, becau&s;e it cannot be too often repeat|ed, that but one po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e exi&s;ts, where a controver&s;y be|tween citizens of the &s;ame State can be carried into the Fede|ral Court. How then is it po&s;&s;ible that the Federal Court can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver &s;wallow up the State juri&s;dictions, or be converted to the purpo&s;es of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SEVERAL rea&s;ons occur why the Federal Court &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s an appellate juri&s;diction in controver&s;ies between foreign|ers and citizens, and between the citizens of different States. A foreigner &s;hould have the privilege of carrying his &s;uit to the Federal Court, as well for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice, as from po|litical motives. Were he confined to &s;eek redre&s;s in the tribu|nal of that State, wherein he received the injury, he might not obtain it, from the influence of his adver&s;ary; and by giv|ing him this additional and certain means of obtaining ju&s;tice, foreigners will be encouraged to trade with us, to give us cre|dit, and to employ their capitals in our country. Then con|trover&s;ies mu&s;t for the mo&s;t part ari&s;e from commercial tran&s;actions, by which the bulk of the people can be &s;eldom effected. The fir&s;t part of this rea&s;oning equally applies to con|trover&s;ies between citizens of different States. Be&s;ides, were the juri&s;diction of the Federal Court not coexten&s;ive with the government it&s;elf, as far as foreigners are concerned, a con|trover&s;y between individuals might produce a national quarrel, which commencing in repri&s;als, would probably terminate in war. Suppo&s;e a &s;ubject of France or Great Britain &s;hould complain to the Mini&s;ter re&s;iding at the &s;eat of Congre&s;s, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain ju&s;tice in a Court of Law, in Vir|ginia,

<P>THOSE objectors who are &s;o much alarmed for the trial by jury, &s;eem little acquainted either with the origin or u&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that celebrated mode of trial.</P>
<P>I WILL take leave to inform them, that by our laws a va|riety of important cau&s;es are daily determined without the in|tervention of a jury, not only in the Court of Chancery, but in tho&s;e of common law; and that by &s;everal of our acts of A&s;&s;embly, the General Court has a power of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing fines as high as 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for incon&s;iderable delinquencies, without the intervention of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry, even to find the fact.</P>
<P>AS I have before ob&s;erved, the&s;e cau&s;es will be from the nature of things, generally mercantile di&s;putes; mu&s;t be mat|ters of account, which will be referred to commi&s;&s;ioners, as is the practice of all common law Courts in &s;imilar ca&s;es. When|ever it may be nece&s;&s;ary that the facts &s;hould be &s;tated, no doubt they will be found by a jury of the State, from whence the cau&s;e is carried; and will be made a part of the record.</P>
<P>IN criminal ca&s;es, the trial by jury is mo&s;t important. In criminal ca&s;es the Con&s;titution has e&s;tabli&s;hed it unequivocal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.
<PB N="50" REF="021264_0049_0FB2B84047E78F40">
But in having only recognized this trial in criminal, it by no means follows that it takes it away in civil ca&s;es: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may fairly pre&s;ume, that by the law which the Congre&s;s will make to compleat the &s;y&s;tem of the Federal Court, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e introduced, as far as it &s;hall be found practicable, and ap|plicable to &s;uch controver&s;ies as from their nature are &s;ubjects proper to be determined in that Court.</P>

<P>HAVING thus gone through the different articles of the Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ution. I will now endeavour to an&s;wer two other objections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have been made to it.

The &s;econd, "that it will annihilate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dependence of the different States."</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t objection I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that as the Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> can claim the exerci&s;e of no right which is not expre&s;sly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them by this Con&s;titution; they will have no power to

re&s;train the pre&s;s in any of the States; and therefore it would have been improper to have taken any notice of it. The ar|ticle re&s;pecting the habeas corpus act corroborates this doc|trine. The Convention were &s;en&s;ible that a federal govern|ment would no more have the right of &s;u&s;pending that u&s;eful law, without the con&s;ent of the States, than that of re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s: But at the &s;ame time they knew that circum&s;tances might ari&s;e to render nece&s;&s;ary the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habeas corpus act, and therefore they require of the States, that they will ve&s;t them with that power, whenever tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances &s;hall exi&s;t. But they al&s;o knew, that no circum|&s;tances could make it nece&s;&s;ary that the liberty of the pre&s;s &s;hould be entru&s;ted to them, and therefore they judged it im|pertinent to introduce the &s;ubject. But &s;till there are fears for the di&s;trict which may become the &s;eat of Congre&s;s, and which may be ten miles &s;quare.</P>
<P>CAN it be for a moment &s;uppo&s;ed, that Congre&s;s will not pre&s;erve the liberty of the pre&s;s in the government of that di&s;|trict? Or that there exi&s;t American citizens &s;o lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of liberty, as to re&s;ide under a govenment where it &s;hall be taken away?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be ob&s;erved, that the con&s;ent of the State where this di&s;trict &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, mu&s;t be obtained by the Congre&s;s: And the State may &s;tipulate the terms of the ce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS to the other objection, I will admit, that by this Con&s;ti|tution, the &s;everal States will be abridged of &s;ome of their powers; but of no more than are nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;trong federal government. Sufficient &s;till remains with the State Le|gi&s;latures to pre&s;erve the quiet, liberty, and welfare, of their citizens. To them is left the whole dome&s;tic government of

the States; they may &s;till regulate the rules of property, the rights of per&s;ons, every thing that relates to their internal po|lice, and whatever effects neither foreign affairs nor the rights of the other States. Powers weighty enough to be entru&s;ted to mo&s;t men; and which good and mode&s;t men would think &s;ufficient to be entru&s;ted to them. Be&s;ides we &s;hould remem|ber that every State has its proportionate &s;hare in the national government; and that the Con&s;titution has not only guaran|teed to them a republican form, but has made <HI>their</HI> indepen|dence nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>its own</HI> exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE adoption of this government will not only pre&s;erve our Union, and thereby &s;ecure our internal happine&s;s; but will re&s;tore that con&s;equence and re&s;pectability abroad, which have been lo&s;t &s;ince the days of Saratoga and York.
