<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A PREFACE is, in common, like the Bill of Fare to an En|tertainment; where the reader &s;ees what he has to &s;et down to. But the author of the <HI>Pill for Porcupine</HI> treats his cu&s;tomers a little in the Iri&s;h &s;tyle, and introduces his e&s;&s;ay with &s;omething which he might, with more ju&s;tice, have called a po&s;tcript.
<Q><L>So Paddy's rea&s;on never fails</L>
<L>To geer draft hor&s;es by their tails.</L></Q>
However, he calls it a Preface, and as &s;uch we will con&s;ider it.&mdash; The principal intention of this &s;aid preface is to give us a ta&s;te of the author's wit again&s;t the <HI>&s;tory-tellers and pumpkin-vines of Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts;</HI> and to drag Mr. CAREY limp|ing in, by the head and &s;houlders, in order to tell the reader that Porcupine had dubbed him a man of honor, that he was a good de|mocrat, and had ri&s;en from care to contentment, without being elated by his pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>With the&s;e compliments to Mr. CAREY I perfectly acquie&s;ce, for as Porcupine has not been very liberal in conferring prai&s;e, there is the more rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it merited in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; and he is quite as welcome to a place of honor among the democrats, for as the&s;e gentry are not remarkable for their attachment to the con|&s;titution and government of the United States, God forbid I &s;hould ever envy him his fame. If there is any credit to be gained by oppo&s;ing the government and its chief magi&s;trate, under which many a citizen, be&s;ides Mr. CAREY, has ri&s;en from <HI>care</HI> to <HI>con|tentment,</HI> from the &s;tate of a needy adventurer to that of indepen|dance and ea&s;e, he is welcome to it all.</P>
<P>But I plainly &s;ee that no order of &s;ociety, no change of circum|&s;tances
<PB N="iv" REF="030314_0003_0FE74F0012261E40">
will de&s;troy inveterate habits and the prejudices of education, if engrafted on a natural &s;tock. Some men, we know, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed through their lives by a love of peace, order, and &s;tability; others again are ever re&s;tle&s;s, turbulent and vindictive, and where|ever they go, they both carry their di&s;tinctive habits along with them.</P>
<Q>"Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt."</Q>
<P>He has now a chance, therefore, of partaking of that "e&s;teem" and of "tho&s;e care&s;&s;es" of the world, &s;o plea&s;ing to the ingenuous mind, and of becoming, as well as Mr. YOUNG, "one of your fine modern gentlemen of ye&s;terday." But it is not only here; in all the civilized countries of the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> riches give con&s;ideration to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: it is &s;o in Scotland as well as Ireland; it is &s;o even in France, that ill-fated country of &s;ans-culotti&s;m: riches have made many a man taken notice of there, and marked his head for the guillotine; if the owner even was innocent, his wealth was a liber|ticide.</P>
<P>Having now &s;aid all that I intended of the Preface, I will make a few remarks on the manner in which the piece was introduced to the public. There was as much my&s;tery u&s;ed in bringing it to mar|ket as if the author thought the ware was contraband, and his life was in danger; but &s;urely &s;o much caution was not nece&s;&s;ary in Phila|delphia, one of the free&s;t places in the world for &s;candal; where men deal without fear or re&s;traint in all that is abu&s;ive and &s;curri|lous, and where neither wi&s;dom nor virtue give protection to their owners.&mdash;On its fir&s;t appearance the &s;ale was confined to the publi&s;hers, and to the ware-hou&s;es of Me&s;&s;rs. CAREY, RICE, and CAMP|BELL, as if it had been a company adventure, and they were re|&s;olved, contrary to the common u&s;age, to engro&s;s it all to them&s;elves; as they did for &s;ome time, though they afterwards permitted others to partake with them, finding it nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;uppo&s;e, in order to di&s;po&s;e of their ware.</P>
<P>But no part of this my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;erves more notice than the choice that was made of a publi&s;her. It looked as if the author intended to give the whole an air of burle&s;que, by choo&s;ing out of all the printers and book-&s;ellers in the city, a &s;ober old gentleman, with the phiz of a covenanting elder, to midwife his &s;currility. This was a grave preface indeed to a dirty &s;ubject; but though a little &s;ingular, was not altogether without example. It is likely he took
<PB N="v" REF="030314_0004_0FE74F0A22BAC710">
the hint from Dr. SWIFT's Tale of a Tub. The Dean tells us in his hi&s;tory of the three brothers, that when Jack had an itch for throwing dirt, he always began the work with a down-looking, p&s;alm-&s;inging face, in order to draw the people about him, and then pelted away manfully. Our author, I &s;uppo&s;e, thought the trick a good one, and re&s;olved to try it in vending his pamphlet; with this difference only, that the one di&s;tributed his filth in the &s;treets, and the other was to do it from behind his counter.</P>
<P>As it would be tire&s;ome to my&s;elf, as well as di&s;gu&s;ting to the reader, to follow this writer through the whole of his mi&s;repre&s;ent|ations, &s;currility and non&s;en&s;e, in the following an&s;wer I &s;hall only &s;elect &s;ome particular parts of the performance, and offer a few ob&s;ervations on them; which I will do with as much connection and order as the &s;ubject will admit, or is po&s;&s;ible in pur&s;uing a Jack o' Lanthorn, who dances from place to place, without any other appar|ent plan than to &s;catter abu&s;e as he goes.</P>

<HEAD>TIT FOR TAT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>"WHAT a cabal was rai&s;ed" &s;ays this writer in the fir&s;t page of his pamphlet, "again&s;t citizen GE|NET, becau&s;e a certain party had a&s;&s;erted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country: was he more culpable than the other (the Briti&s;h agent) who does it by means of a hire|ling?" as if there was any analogy between the conduct of GE|NET and that of <HI>Peter Porcupine,</HI> who is the hireling alluded to. In one ca&s;e, a foreign mini&s;ter que&s;tioned the authority of the Executive of the United States; threatened to appeal from it to the people at large, and really did &s;o; caballed with turbulent and ambitious men; &s;et on foot popular clubs to embarra&s;s the government; and in &s;hort carried his in&s;olence and intrigues to &s;uch an alarming height, as to oblige the Pre&s;ident to in&s;i&s;t on his recall: in the other, it is in defence of this government, again&s;t the emi&s;&s;aries that GENET left behind, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have &s;ince rai&s;ed up, that mo&s;t, if not all the e&s;&s;ays under the &s;igna|ture of Porcupine have been levelled. So that if the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter or agent had any concern in &s;etting him to work, which &s;incerely I do not believe, he certainly acted a friendly part by by our government: but as there is not the lea&s;t evidence of &s;uch a connection, it would be unju&s;t to deprive Peter of any part of the credit he has gained by a &s;pontaneous act.</P>
<P>As far as I am able to judge of his motives from his writings, he has been provoked to take up the pen by the &s;currilous abu&s;e that has been wantonly heaped on his native country; and to defend the government of this again&s;t its wor&s;t enemies, the creatures of France, who have endeavored to reduce
<PB N="8" REF="030314_0006_0FE5B95040026548">
America to the &s;ame &s;ubjection to her ambitious polititics as every other nation that has been cur&s;ed with her alliance. This &s;prightly and ingenious writer expects no other reward nor patronage than &s;uch as he has received already, from a liberal and enlightened public: his enemies therefore may be a&s;&s;ured that he neither feels "a contrition" for what he has publi&s;hed, nor "has the fountain nearly ran dry." Long may he continue the champion of order and the federal government, as well as a &s;courge to all its ene|mies, whether of American, Engli&s;h, French or Iri&s;h growth! The peaceable and good citizens of the United States, from whatever nation derived, he never de&s;igned to offend, and he is happy in being a&s;&s;ured that few of them are his real enemies, whatever the cut-throats of France or the thieves of Ireland may be. The ba&s;e attempt, therefore, of this pamphleteer, and o|thers, to accu&s;e him of vilifying the very re&s;pectable citizens of Philadelphia, as a "mob or banditti," is of a piece with other democratic tricks, and is doubtle&s;s intended to collect a mob, in order to an&s;wer his wit and arguments by the rhetoric of &s;tones and brick-bats.</P>
<P>As we proceed in the examination of this pamphlet, we &s;hall find the writer is as much an enemy of human nature, and of all its amiable feelings, as he is of candor and truth. In page 10, "With regard" &s;ays he "to the murders and outrages com|mitted by the French nation, there are none will believe a &s;ingle fact &s;tated by Porcupine, except <HI>credulous children</HI> or prejudiced <HI>old women,</HI> &s;inking into their dotage." Why he excepts children and old women I cannot gue&s;s: it would have been nearer the mark had he &s;aid <HI>they only</HI> di&s;believe, for few others are &s;o igno|rant of what has pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;anguinary theatre of France, as to doubt what Porcupine has narrated in his <HI>"Bloody Buoy."</HI> The murders at Paris on the 2d and 3d of September; the ma&s;&s;acres at Avignon and Ver&s;ailles; the &s;hootings and drown|ings at Lyons and Nantes; and all the other horrid &s;cenes in the various departments, which fix an indelible &s;tain on the name of liberty, have all been confirmed by &s;uch a cloud of e|vidence, that none but tho&s;e who are determined to &s;hut out conviction, can entertain a doubt. Their own public papers, to go no further, contain undeniable proofs of the ferocious cha|racter
<PB N="9" REF="030314_0007_0FE5B9526FC7E348">
of this people, from the fir&s;t year of the revolution to this day&mdash;from JOURDAN, the cut-throat of Avignon, to BUONA|PARTE, the modern Attila, and &s;courge of Italy; and the hi|&s;tories of all their former civil wars are &s;tamped with the &s;ame character, although none of them equalled the pre&s;ent in bloo|dy &s;cenes. Formerly they had &s;ome &s;en&s;e of Religion to re|&s;train them, but now the Stygian philo&s;ophy of their <HI>Diderots,</HI> their <HI>Ceruttis</HI> and their <HI>Condorcets</HI> has not only &s;oured the &s;mall mixture of humanity they had in their natures, but removed all fear of God and love of man from their hearts. In aid of na|tive ferocity, they now po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> of daemons.</P>
<P>The hecatombs of innocent women and children, &s;acrificed on the altar of their Moloch, the Godde&s;s of Liberty, are "no evidence" &s;ays this pamphleteer, none at all "of the cruelty and inju&s;tice of the nation, but are the fulle&s;t proofs of their lenity and forbearance." What think you, Reader, of a mon&s;ter who would venture to contaminate an American pre&s;s with &s;uch &s;entiments? Beware of &s;uch men, for he that would advocate &s;uch cruelties, would imitate them, if he dared. He is wor&s;e, indeed, than the very in&s;truments who committed them, for he cannot plead the &s;ame excu&s;e of example, of fear or revenge: he &s;its down, coolly, at his de&s;k, three thou&s;and miles remov|ed from the terrible &s;cene, and enjoys, with the complacency of a daemon, the &s;acrifice of thou&s;ands of victims, who&s;e cruel fate would make an American &s;avage &s;hudder with horror. With him it is all "lenity and forbearance, &s;hort-lived preju|dice, or the re&s;ult of irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity": and &s;o &s;aid <HI>Robe&s;|pierre</HI> and his &s;atellites, when engaged in their murdering work: their cant phra&s;e for murder was <HI>travailler &agrave; la Revolu|tion.</HI> One of the&s;e mon&s;ters, writing of the Royali&s;ts in la Vend&eacute;e, very coolly remarked, that if the remaining popula|tion did not exceed thirty or forty thou&s;and &s;ouls,&mdash;"certainly the quicke&s;t way to fini&s;h the war, is to cut all their throats"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>: and he &s;aid right, but it would require an army of &s;uch canni|bals as him&s;elf, or as our pamphleteer, to execute the order, and &s;uch, unhappily, were found. This very humane dele|gate,
<PB N="10" REF="030314_0008_0FE5B957DD5BCEE0">
reader, was one of your modern philo&s;ophers! the au|thor of a treati&s;e entitled <HI>Prejudices De&s;troyed!</HI> and the&s;e mon|&s;ters are &s;till held up by their American admirers as worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>But to repeat proofs of the unparalleled atrocities committed in France, would be painful to the humane reader, and to tho&s;e of the &s;ame temper as this writer it would be labour lo&s;t; they would not "believe a &s;ingle fact" becau&s;e recorded in the <HI>Bloody Buoy.</HI> To &s;uch I recommend the peru&s;al of Mi&s;s HELEN WIL|LIAMS'S la&s;t letters from Paris. She is a republican, as well as a great admirer of the French nation: her &s;i&s;ter is married to one of the Revolutioni&s;ts. "When the future hi&s;torian," &s;ays this elegant writer, "who&s;e faithful pen mu&s;t trace the hideous features of the Vend&eacute;an war, in all their deformity, &s;hall de|&s;cribe &s;cenes which I dare not name, let no one, becau&s;e he may con&s;ider &s;uch crimes as &s;carcely within the verge of human po&s;&s;ibility, doubt that they have been committed."</P>
<P>But, according to this writer, Porcupine is not alone "in his abu&s;e of the French nation; Mr. HAMILTON has trodden the &s;ame path before him. The latter in his writings has endeavor|ed to prove that it was not from di&s;intere&s;ted motives that France took an active part in the American Revolution, but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride of England"&mdash; and is there a &s;ingle Democrat weak enough to think otherwi&s;e? "But" adds he, <Q>admitting this was the motive, <HI>they</HI> certainly loved us more than Great Britain did; and if they loved us more, ought not our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in preference to us.</Q> There is &s;omething very much like non&s;en&s;e both in meaning and con&s;truction of this whining &s;entence about love, but as I am not fond of quarrelling with men for the blunders of mere ignorance, I will endeavor to gue&s;s at his meaning. It is then, if I under&s;tand him, that, although France entered in|to the American war from mere hatred and jealou&s;y of Great-Britain, &s;he thereby evinced her &s;uperior affection for the peo|ple of the&s;e States, and has, in con&s;equence, a ju&s;t claim to a preference when her intere&s;t and that of her rival are brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030314_0009_0FE5B9595580A380">But if we admit the premi&s;es, the conclu&s;ion by no means follows. The Briti&s;h colonies in America were planted, che|ri&s;hed and protected by the parent &s;tate at a great expen&s;e; &s;he thought &s;he had a legitimate authority over them, and when they revolted, &s;he con&s;idered them as rebellious children, whom &s;he had a right to reduce to obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: had Ireland or any part of the i&s;land of Great-Britain revolted, &s;he would have acted in the &s;ame manner: but it does not follow, becau&s;e &s;he carried her parental claims too far, that &s;he had le&s;s friend&s;hip for her children than a foreign nation had, who&s;e government was an ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, who&s;e religion and man|ners were diametrically oppo&s;ite&mdash;a nation which had been the inveterate enemy of the name of an Engli&s;hman for ages, and which, not twenty years before, had invaded this country with fleets and armies, with an intention to &s;ubjugate or expel the inhabitants. For a bigotted tyrant to be converted into a pa|tron of civil and religious liberty, an avowed enemy into a real friend, without any apparent cau&s;e, is too great a miracle to meet with belief now a days. If a man does me a good office to &s;erve him&s;elf or to injure a third per&s;on who is his enemy, or for both rea&s;ons combined, there is no merit whatever in the act. The ca&s;e between this country and France was exactly parallel. She con&s;idered the Briti&s;h colonies as part of the national &s;trength, as a limb of the body politic, and if &s;he could but cut it off, &s;he would not care if it rotted immediately afterwards, unle&s;s &s;he expected to derive &s;ome future benefit from it.</P>
<P>Her motives to a&s;&s;i&s;t America were ju&s;t the &s;ame as induced her to aid the Pretender and the rebels of Scotland in 1715 and 1745; to excite the <HI>patriots</HI> in Holland, who, by the bye, were all <HI>ari&s;tocrats,</HI> again&s;t the Stadtholder; to &s;upport the par|ty in Sweden called the <HI>Hats</HI> again&s;t another called the <HI>Night-Caps,</HI> to the great detriment of the nation; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Genoe&s;e in &s;ubjugating the brave inhabitants of Cor&s;ica. All the&s;e acts originated in the &s;ame ba&s;e and cowardly policy, that ever governed the cabinet of Ver&s;ailles, and that &s;till predomi|nates in the &s;ecret councils of the nation, as we have wofully
<PB N="12" REF="030314_0010_0FE5B95A83A9CA38">
experienced. A tenth part of the money they have &s;pent, and a twentieth part of the pains they have taken, to di&s;turb and injure their neighbors, wi&s;ely be&s;towed on their own people and government, would long ago have placed them with real digni|ty at the head of the nations, the great object of their ambi|tion; whereas by their mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;&s;es hitherto they have never ri&s;en to eminence but with the cur&s;es of all good men on their heads. This, &s;o far as relates to the ancient gov|ernment, has the con&s;ent of the republicans them&s;elves, and how applicable it is to the pre&s;ent rulers, po&s;terity will decide.</P>
<P>But if we leave motive out of the que&s;tion, and admit that "one good turn de&s;erves another", and that it does, has grown into a maxim, it was certainly due to the party who did the ac|tion; to the royal family and nobles of France; to men who have been murdered, or have fled from the daggers of the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, and who&s;e memories the democrats of this country, the vile ingrates, as well as the Jacobins of France, pur&s;ue with in|ce&s;&s;ant yells of defamation. Their enemies in France would not allow them to breathe the vital air, and tho&s;e of America will not admit that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle virtue. The merit of all their actions in promoting the independence of America, by &s;ome kind of hocus pocus, is in&s;tantly transferred to the Re|publicans, who had no more voice in the bu&s;ine&s;s than the &s;laves of Algiers. All the benefits we received from Louis XVI. are carried to the credit of the republic, and all the evils we &s;uffer|ed under Louis XV. are charged to the de&s;poti&s;m of the king. This is the way the&s;e democrats keep their accounts: God pre&s;erve my affairs from &s;uch ra&s;cally book-keepers!</P>
<P>"National pride, ambition, folly and intere&s;t," this &s;cribbler a&s;&s;erts, "are the governing and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other," and yet <Q>France, [mark the man's incon&s;i&s;tency, France, under an ab&s;olute monarch] more <HI>enlight|ened</HI> and <HI>magnanimous</HI> than all the re&s;t, gave America early proofs of her friend&s;hip, by entering into a treaty of alliance with her.</Q> Enlightened and magnanimous! Ah! poor Louis, he would have been le&s;s magnanimous, indeed I think he would, had he been more enlightened! Little did he imagine, when he &s;ent his <HI>La Fayettes,</HI> his <HI>D'E&s;taings, De Gra&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Ro|chambeaus,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="030314_0011_0FE5B95C1D24B950">
to fight our battles, that they would bring back with them a tyger from the woods of America, that in the cour&s;e of twelve years would de&s;troy him and all his family!&mdash;and that after he was dead the people of America would cur&s;e his memo|ry! No, no, magnanimity was as far from the heart of this unfor|tunate king as fore&s;ight was from his head. He intended to dig a pit for his neighbor, and fell into it him&s;elf. It is a le&s;&s;on of importance to kings; and no country was &s;o &s;it to teach the le&s;&s;on as France, who&s;e kings, for more than three centuries before, had been con&s;tantly employed in embroiling the affairs of their neighbors.</P>
<P>But we will leave the&s;e monarchs to their own de&s;igns: I grant that, in general, they are ambitious and intere&s;ted enough, and I am afraid the motives of the ill-fated Louis were not pur|er than tho&s;e of kings in common&mdash;if they were, I am &s;ure we have been va&s;tly ungrateful&mdash;and we will now turn to the con|nection between republics. Here, if we believe this writer, and all of the &s;ame &s;tamp, the &s;cene brightens: it is on the repub|lican floor we are told to look for "univer&s;al benevolence", "di&s;|intere&s;ted friend&s;hip", and "cordial attachment"&mdash;a mere Mil|lenium!</P>
<P>I do not know from what &s;ources this writer has derived his hi&s;torical knowledge; to judge from what he a&s;&s;erts, one would imagine that he had &s;tudied the Hi&s;tory of Utopia, the Repub|lic of Plato, the Social Contract of Rou&s;&s;eau, and other politi|cal reveries: I never read them but as ingenious romances: my information concerning men in civil &s;ociety, is drawn from the annals of governments not quite &s;o vi&s;ionary. I have looked into the hi&s;tory of Switzerland, cantoned into a number of pet|ty republics; &s;urrounded and inter&s;ected by almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains; poor, frugal, and in a good degree virtuous: yet the daemon of di&s;cord found his way among them, and often impelled one diminutive commonwealth to draw the &s;word a|gain&s;t another. Venice and Genoa, two commercial republics, have engaged in long and frequent wars, to extend their trade or enlarge their power. Every &s;chool-boy knows that Rome and Carthage, two of the mo&s;t eminent republics of antiquity, were the &s;laves of avarice and ambition, and contended for empire
<PB N="14" REF="030314_0012_0FE5B96336C4BC98">
with unrelenting animo&s;ity, until one of them was wholly ruin|ed. Carthage had her Hamilcars and her Hannibals, and Rome had her Catos, the patriots of tho&s;e days, who were con|&s;tantly impelling ther fellow-citizens to de&s;troy fleets, burn towns, and cut the throats of the inhabitants, or to drag them into captivity. The Republics of Lacedaemon, Athens and Thebes were always at daggers drawn. The States of Greece were never at peace among them&s;elves, except when the &s;words of the Per&s;ians were at their doors: and their common danger was not &s;ufficient to unite them perfectly, until they were bound together by the authority of one head, a Philip or an Alexan|der. Had it not been for &s;ome &s;uch power, to &s;ilence their de|magogues, patriots &s;uch as we are cur&s;ed with, nothing is more likely than that they would have yielded at la&s;t to the arms or the gold of the great king; who, when he could not conquer, knew, as well as any French mini&s;ter, that "Patriots have their price."</P>
<P>What &s;hall we think then of this &s;illy writer, when he talks of the intere&s;t, ambition and pride of kings, and of the vir|tues and friend&s;hip of Republics? &s;hall we not &s;ay that he talks like one that dreams? But the&s;e quacks have a plai&s;ter for eve|ry &s;ore. They will tell you, that the ancients were ignorant beings, unacquainted with the principles of government, with the due arrangement of power, the checks and balances di&s;co|vered by modern politicians. This is not &s;o clear as &s;ome may imagine; but be it as it may, it is certain that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed quite as much public virtue, and as much love of country, the grand cement of &s;ociety, as we do; and were quite as free from the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, the bane of public and private happi|ne&s;s, as we are, after &s;o many centuries of improvement. It is virtue that gives &s;tability to empire, it is righteou&s;ne&s;s that ex|alteth a nation, more than any cho&s;en form of government whatever.</P>
<P>We have already had a &s;cantling, in our own infant country, the be&s;t con&s;tructed republic that ever exi&s;ted, of the propen&s;i|ties of the&s;e &s;ame fellows, called patriots: we have &s;een how they would manage our affairs if God in his wrath &s;hould put them into their hands: have we not experienced, in a time of

univer&s;al peace, and a &s;tate of unexampled pro&s;perity, that there are men among us <HI>proud, ambitious, di&s;contented</HI> and <HI>&s;tupid enough</HI> to attempt to &s;ubvert this goodly &s;tructure, to pro&s;trate its honor in du&s;t, and to ru&s;h madly into a war, without cau&s;e, or means, or end?</P>
<P>The&s;e men &s;hould either cea&s;e clamouring again&s;t the govern|ment of their own country, and vomiting their gall again&s;t its be&s;t citizens, or &s;ay no more in prai&s;e of republican virtue and happine&s;s. Let us fir&s;t &s;hew an example of the love of peace, without which no country can pro&s;per, of harmony, of mode|ration and wi&s;dom, that the world may &s;ee what good the &s;y|&s;tem is really capable of producing; as we are the only republic now exi&s;ting, except a few in&s;ignificant communities ne&s;tled a|mong the rocks of Italy: and if, after the experience of one hundred years, which is a &s;hort age for an empire, we have proved the excellence of the form and materials, we may exult. Until then, every wi&s;e man will be mode&s;t, and forbear joining in cry with tho&s;e yelping curs who are ever di&s;turbing the world with their noi&s;e.</P>
<P>But let us follow this writer; <Q>to convince America and the world more fully" &s;ays he, "that her former &s;ervices were not the effect of a temporary, &s;ordid, &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t, &s;he (France) has &s;ince made overtures for entering into a treaty anew; on principles the mo&s;t <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>flattering</HI> to the national dignity of America, and <HI>advantageous</HI> to her inter|re&s;ts. But Mr. HAMILTON, <HI>&s;tiff in opinion and always in the wrong,</HI></Q> not content with que&s;tioning the purity of Louis's mo|tives in the former treaty, "by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly de&s;igns, and render|ed all her (generous) overtures (for another) abortive." Sad fellow! But as it is not ju&s;t to condemn him, before we exam|ine the&s;e overtures, nor to take things on the word of this writer, we will recur to Citizen GENET'S account of the affair: he was better acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s than any other per&s;on on this &s;ide the Atlantic, being the agent employed to bring it forward. In his <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> which he afterwards pub|li&s;hed in his own defence, we were informed that the United States were invited to the honor of making "a common cau&s;e"
<PB N="16" REF="030314_0014_0FE5B96541CF2E38">
with the French, in their war with all the world; of "guaran|teeing their We&s;t-India i&s;lands"; of "receiving commi&s;&s;ions", as generals, colonels, captains, &amp;c. in and under the authority of the Republic; "of &s;u&s;pending all our other commercial pur|&s;uits; and" of refu&s;ing admi&s;&s;ion into our ports to all nations with whom they were or might be at war; in order&mdash;for what, think you&mdash;"<HI>to befriend the Empire of Liberty!!</HI>&mdash;and on condition of our compliance with the&s;e very <HI>honorable</HI> and <HI>flat|tering</HI> terms, and on this condition alone; we are promi&s;ed "a free commerce with the French We&s;t-Indies"; where, by the bye, the whites, blacks and yellows were too bu&s;y in burning towns and plantations, and in cutting of throats, in a little di&s;|pute they had of their own, about <HI>the empire of liberty,</HI> to attend much to commerce. If the Briti&s;h had not landed, and &s;nat|ched part of the country from de&s;truction, I believe they would by this time have had no commerce at all.</P>
<P>This is the treaty the French citizen had to propo&s;e, and which the Pre&s;ident and his council thought proper to reject. Indeed what plea could they offer to the world, or to their own con&s;ciences; what temptation had they for contracting any kind of treaty with a band of daring u&s;urpers, who&s;e hands were &s;till reeking with the blood of their own king, our benefactor, whom they had murdered in violation of the mo&s;t &s;olemn con|tract. The alliance might have been u&s;eful and glorious to them, but to us it would have been di&s;graceful and ruinous. What think you, my fellow-citizens, of a foreigner, who at this time of day undertakes to advocate &s;uch in&s;idious and ini|mical overtures? is there any degree of contempt and dete&s;ta|tion adequate to &s;uch in&s;olence? A man mu&s;t either be a fool him&s;elf, or have a very mean opinion of the under&s;tanding of his readers, before he would venture to pollute paper with &s;o daring an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Were it not for the great pains that have been taken and &s;till are taking to mi&s;lead the public mind, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to take any notice at this time, of a &s;ubject that has been &s;o of|ten and &s;o fully handled before; but before I quit it, I will make one more remark, and it will come in more &agrave; propos in this place than in any other. Whatever advantages the United

States derived from their treaties with France, they cea&s;ed with the death of the king: &s;ince that epoch they have produced no|thing but di&s;cord: and happy had it been for us if the Execu|tive, when citizen GENET fir&s;t &s;et his foot in America, had, with his wonted firmne&s;s, declared that the relation between the two countries was di&s;&s;olved; that the guillotine of Robe&s;pierre and Orleans had cut the tie. He would then have had but one battle to fight: whereas, by admitting the revival of a contract extingui&s;hed by them&s;elves, he has had to contend with the republic and her American allies about the interpretation of every material article; and planted thorns in his own admini|&s;tration, which have at length goaded him to a re&s;ignation, when his virtues, talents, and good name are &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of his country.</P>
<P>However heterodox this opinion may &s;ound in the ears of &s;ome men, I am &s;ure it is not &s;ingular, and I think the recent conduct of the French &s;ufficiently proves that it is not unfound|ed. They have manife&s;ted by their actions, which &s;peak louder than words, that they con&s;ider the treaties as null and void, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they bind on them&s;elves, and that they never intended to make u&s;e of them as any thing more than a &s;tepping &s;tone to the new one projected: and as they have failed an&s;wer|ing this purpo&s;e, they are re&s;olved that they &s;hall not protect our &s;hips and cargoes from their rapacity. After this &s;hort digre&s;|&s;ion, reader, we will now &s;tep back to the &s;pot where we left our author di&s;charging his venom again&s;t Mr. HAMILTON.</P>
<P>"From the influence" &s;ays he, "Mr. HAMILTON'S writings <HI>has</HI> had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced <HI>it</HI> will render <HI>them</HI> the contempt and &s;corn of Europe." That is, his writings fir&s;t tinge the American character, then <HI>it</HI> renders <HI>them</HI> the contempt and &s;corn of Europe&mdash;which is a droll kind of a battle between <HI>it</HI> and <HI>them:</HI> however, we &s;hall by this means be fully revenged of the&s;e wicked writings, for if they once become the &s;corn of Europe, it will not be long be|fore they will become the &s;corn of America too.&mdash;But I do not believe a word of all this non&s;en&s;e:&mdash;it is a beautiful tinge that Mr. H's writings have given to the American character&mdash;it is the
<PB N="18" REF="030314_0016_0FE5B96ADC3538D0">
&s;ky-blue of peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Pacificus"</NOTE>; and if &s;uch publications as the one now before me do not communicate any wor&s;e impre&s;&s;ion, which from their fleeting nature I hope they will not, I am convinced &s;he long will retain her pre&s;ent amiable colour in the eyes of the world. God, in his mercy, pre&s;erve her from the blood-co|loured tinge of France!</P>
<P>"Have we not daily &s;triking proofs of my a&s;&s;ertion," adds he. "Have not the American citizens been treated with <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> by the French"? Yes, if by coldne&s;s he means that they have &s;eized, and plundered, and detained our property, to the value of four or five millions of dollars, for which we &s;hall never receive a &s;ingle &s;ous. This is the coldne&s;s of death, and is a mi&s;erable return for the animating warmth American ho&s;pitality has communicated to their half-dead, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed emigrants. "Have they not been hara&s;&s;ed, vexed, and buffetted by the Engli&s;h? Yes, God confound the plunderers of both nations: but it is unju&s;t not to make this di&s;tinction, that the latter owed us no favours, and that by the la&s;t treaty with them, we &s;hall recover full compen&s;ation for all our legal demands. "And have not the Algerines compelled us to purcha&s;e a treaty, at the enormous &s;um of twelve hundred thou&s;and dollars?" Yes, and they have, to the eternal di&s;grace of Europe, compelled her mo&s;t powerful &s;tates to buy treaties on &s;till more humiliating terms: but I hardly think tho&s;e blackguard Mu&s;&s;ulmen ever &s;aw any of Mr. HAMILTON'S writings; or care in the lea&s;t whether we hate the French or the Engli&s;h mo&s;t. They hate all men, who are not circumci&s;ed according to the law of Mahomet, and if they have any property, con&s;ider it as a natural game.</P>
<P>We have now done with his abu&s;e of the French; <HI>the only na|tion</HI> from which America could expect to receive <HI>real acts of friend&s;hip!</HI> and &s;hall next follow our author in viewing his conduct with regard to the United States internally, "where" he &s;ays "we will find as little cau&s;e of approbation and panegric." Then he proceeds to tell his readers that in the Convention, &s;ummoned to frame the Federal Con&s;titution, Mr. HAMILTON was foiled in his attempt to introduce a monarchical government,
<PB N="19" REF="030314_0017_0FE5B96C79D8D298">
and that, on finding the con&s;titution was popular, and "admitted great latitude of con&s;truction," he at length &s;igned it: but as this was forced work, he did it grudgingly, and not only "me|ditated but &s;ought revenge" for his di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>However, from the account given his re&s;entment was not very deep, or he had an excellent knack at concealing it; for the fir&s;t act of public notoriety that we find him engaged in, was "in conjunction with Mr. MADISON, to write in &s;upport of the con&s;titution"; and he did it &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully that "he not only e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation as a man of abilities, but as a firm federali&s;t, and that too among the real friends of the con&s;titu|tion." Whether he has per&s;evered in &s;upporting what he did not altogether approve, we &s;hall &s;ee further as we proceed; but it is certain Mr. MADISON has changed in his conduct greatly, for he has openly and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the con&s;titution and its whole executive branch. The one has been the champion of what he did not approve, becau&s;e it was popular, and the other has combated what he did approve, becau&s;e he has been di&s;appointed. Which, reader, is the mo&s;t virtuous public character?</P>
<P>But re&s;entment &s;till rankled in Mr. HAMILTON'S brea&s;t; he &s;till cheri&s;hed a predilection for royalty and the pomps of govern|ment&mdash;and of cour&s;e a &s;ecret aver&s;ion for our plain republican manners. To this &s;ource may be traced, &s;ays our <HI>equality-man,</HI> the introduction of <HI>Etiquette, Bu&s;tle, Levees,</HI> and a train of other ari&s;tocratic creatures, who daily mounted guard at the Pre&s;ident's door, to the great &s;candal and terror of all good &s;ans culottes: indeed it is &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that the&s;e &s;ame gentry, in con|junction with HAMILTON and others, formed a con&s;piracy to blow up the Con&s;titution and all its friends, &s;ome dark night, when they were fa&s;t a&s;leep; but happily the de&s;ign was di&s;cov|ered time enough to prevent it.&mdash;</P>
<P>One of the principal per&s;ons engaged with him in the helli&s;h plot was a certain Mr. JOHN FENNO, editor of the United States Gazette. The part he was to act, was to in&s;ert time after time, in his <HI>Courtly</HI> paper, certain in&s;idious para|graphs, calculated to poi&s;on the public mind, and to give it an ari&s;tocratic tinge; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as "Ju&s;t arrived in town, the Honorable Mr. &s;uch a one"&mdash;and "The Honorable Mr.
<PB N="20" REF="030314_0018_0FE5B96D9DDBF778">
&mdash;, from Richmond, Norfolk or Charle&s;ton, on his way to Bo&s;ton"&mdash;and, to carry on the "Diabolical Scheme" &s;till better, he was directed to "inter&s;prer&s;e, occa&s;ionally, &s;ome pious &s;ay|ing of &s;ome good old woman to the ea&s;tward, who had been drowned for witchcraft," and a thou&s;and other incantations, all tending to the &s;ame dreadful purpo&s;e. Happily, as I have &s;aid the plot was di&s;covered before it was ripe for execution; by which "the paper lo&s;t it's circulation, and the printer was obliged to change it into a daily Gazette," as well as to rai&s;e the price from three to eight dollars pr. annum!!</P>
<P>When this machiavelian &s;cheme failed, Mr. HAMILTON was obliged, &s;ays our San&s;culottes, to vary his plan, and to attack &s;ome other quarter. As &s;oon as he came into the office of Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury, for which the Pre&s;ident was weak enough to think him well qualified, finding the finances of the United States, void of order, and void of hope, &s;omething like mother <HI>Chaos,</HI> before time began; when the dome&s;tic creditors apprehended all their &s;craps of paper would become, like old <HI>Conti,</HI> fit for nothing but to light a pipe with, and the foreign creditors began to look upon us as a nation of &s;windlers and pick-pockets&mdash;at this time, I &s;ay, he contrived his d&mdash;d fund|ing &s;y&s;tem, by which hope was brought back to the widow and orphan at home, and foreigners recovered their ancient faith in American honour. This, it is plain, was a home &s;troke at the Democratic part of the Con&s;titution, for, in direct op|po&s;ition to Democratic principles, it was calculated to pay off our debts; and every body knows that a man, and by the &s;ame rea&s;on, a government out of debt, is out of credit. Be|&s;ides, to pay debts is a mark of a pitiful &s;pirit, unworthy the high-mettled Democrat, who&s;e principal inducement to engage in the war, was to put his creditors at defiance.</P>
<P>But all that preceded was nothing, &s;ays our Pampheteer, to his la&s;t nefarious attempt, the <HI>Exci&s;e law.</HI> In this he mani|fe&s;ted the whole depth of his malice, as well as the extent of his talents. As he knew that the patriots beyond the moun|tains, where they are as
<Q><L>"Thick as leaves that &s;trew the brooks</L>
<L>In Val' Ombro&s;a"&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="21" REF="030314_0019_0FE5B97412754FB0">
were pa&s;&s;ionately fond of whi&s;key, he re&s;olved that, as it was a Democratic liquor, they &s;hould not drink it duty free. He pretended that in the di&s;tilleries they wa&s;ted a grain, by which they might fatten hogs, hor&s;es and cows, and thereby increa&s;e the real wealth and &s;trength of the &s;tate; in&s;tead of which, by drinking &s;o much ardent &s;pirits, they not only injured their healths, but continued poor and drunkards, as their fathers had been before them. For this rea&s;on he taxed it at the enor|mous rate of &s;even or eight cents pr. gallon; and as it is not uncommon in that country for a man to con&s;ume a quart or more a day, &s;o every day he cho&s;e to get drunk, he was obliged to pay two or three cents towards the di&s;charge of the public debt. This any body will allow, was &s;ufficient to &s;hake the fidelity of the Whi&s;key counties, was it ever &s;o firmly rooted, and to produce a revolt. It had the effect: and Braddock's field was the <HI>Mons &s;acer</HI> to which the plebeans &s;eceded, to con|&s;ult and organize their force. Warm debates took place: &s;ome of the mo&s;t wary, willing to &s;ecure a retreat, if things went contrary to their wi&s;h, propo&s;ed moderate mea&s;ures, but
<Q><L>Others apart &s;at on a hill retired,</L>
<L>And rea&s;oned high of war and &s;eparation,</L>
<L>Of Independence, and the de'il knows what.</L></Q></P>
<P>As is common on &s;uch occa&s;ions the violent prevailed: the &s;tandard of rebellion was unfurled, alias liberty-poles were erected, and damnation drank to HAMILTON and the Exci&s;e law in many gallon of whi&s;key. This our author &s;ays was the cri&s;is that the Secretary wi&s;hed for. It was not &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law he de&s;ired, it was oppo&s;ition, which would pave the way for a military force. "Hence we find him giving encou|ragement to the oppo&s;ition, by an ill-timed forbearance of urg|ing the judiciary authority." Had he at the commencement, "ordered &s;uits in law to be commenced again&s;t the refractory, it is univer&s;ally believed, by tho&s;e who know better than Mr. HAMILTON, the temper of people in the we&s;tern counties of Penn|&s;ylvania, and the <HI>re&s;pect which they have always manife&s;ted</HI> for the judiciary authority, that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion would have been ob|tained:" or in other words, had the Secretary a&s;&s;umed a bold
<PB N="22" REF="030314_0020_0FE5B975463606E0">
decided tone at fir&s;t, the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been brought &s;ooner to a clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us examine this &s;tatement a little further: let us &s;uppo&s;e Fox, the cowardly deputy-mar&s;hal, who fled from among them to &s;ave his life, had been &s;ent back with peremptory orders to execute his proce&s;s at all ri&s;ques whatever; or in ca&s;e he could not be prevailed with to go, had the mar&s;hal him&s;elf been or|dered to proceed on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;ummon all the civil au|thority to his aid; the wor&s;t that could have happened, was, that &s;ome of them might have been &s;calped, and others of them perhaps only branded, or tarred and feathered, to the no &s;mall entertainment of the rebels. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the militia would have been called out in 92 in&s;tead of 94, and &s;ooner this had happened the better, as &s;o much time would have been &s;aved; for no body is fooli&s;h enough to believe, after the amend|ments made in the law, and &s;o much pains taken to reconcile them to it without &s;ucce&s;s, they would have &s;ubmitted, 'till they were forced. Force at length, and nothing but force, wrought &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: it was the logic of fifteen thou&s;and bayonets that convinced the We&s;tern Sansculottes of their mi&s;take, and taught them what they had never learned before, due "re&s;pect to the judiciary authority."</P>
<P>It is true enough therefore that the Secretary "was unac|quainted with the temper" of the people. Accomodation or lenient mea&s;ures were not calculated to operate &s;ucce&s;sfully on their licentious &s;pirits. After bani&s;hing the exci&s;e from among them, and the officers too, they might have returned to an im|perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as &s;uited their own palates, for the be|nefit of protection and defence, but it would ever have been precarious and uncertain. A man who by an excur&s;ion on the high-way, or on the high &s;eas, acquires a booty worth pre|&s;erving, thinks the laws of &s;ome u&s;e, when they protect him in the enjoyment of his acqui&s;itions. That is a dreadful villain indeed, who does not acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>re&s;pecting</HI> the laws &s;ome part of his life.</P>
<P>After the ma&s;&s;acre of the Indians at Cone&s;togo and Lanca&s;ter, and the attempt that followed, to cut the throats of a remnant that fled to Philadelphia for &s;helter, &s;ome thirty years ago; and
<PB N="23" REF="030314_0021_0FE5B97705A90538">
after butchering the inhabitants of three or four Moravian towns in cold blood, at the clo&s;e of the continental war; the heroes, the&s;e very whi&s;ky boys for aught I know, returned, very quietly, to their homes and to <HI>the re&s;pect they always had and &s;ince have manife&s;ted to the laws.</HI> The&s;e licentious pranks, the&s;e overleapings of law, are too habitual with &s;ome of the back &s;ettlers of Penn&s;ylvania: at one time it is a thir&s;t for blood, and at another for whi&s;key; but at all times it manife&s;ts a wild, di&s;orderly, and &s;omewhat a cruel temper.</P>
<P>But Mr. HAMILTON not only betrayed his ignorance, in the e&s;timate he formed of the character of the We&s;tern people, he was equally mi&s;taken when he took &s;o much pains to procure evidence, to impeach tho&s;e old foxes FINDLEY, SMILIE and GALLATIN. However active the&s;e gentlemen were at fir&s;t, in &s;preading the whi&s;key mania, they &s;oon found their authority with the populace was &s;upplanted by new favorites, men of greater daring; and they wheeled to the right about, and left the poor deluded devils in the lurch. They took care to make their own peace by complying with the Pre&s;ident's Proclamation, &mdash;the door left open for repenting &s;inners,&mdash;and HAMILTON might have earthed a fox in the fore&s;ts of Alleghany, &s;ooner than he could have entrapped one of them. No, no; "they became active in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the In&s;urrection"&mdash;when they found it was likely to mi&s;carry: they had rai&s;ed the devil, and they were re&s;olved to &s;natch at &s;ome credit in laying him too. Whether the ignorant herd will re-elect the&s;e betrayers to repre|&s;ent them in the general and &s;tate legi&s;latures is uncertain; if they do, it will be con&s;idered hereafter as a proof either that they are extremely ignorant, or not &s;incere in their repentance.</P>
<P>But it is amazing, if we believe this writer, what a number of different forms the Secretary a&s;&s;umed to come at evidence to cri|minate the&s;e leaders. One moment we find him in the charac|ter of an "ho&s;pitable friend"; next he put on the "&s;ubtilty of a fiend"; and when the&s;e failed, we find him "like the frog in the fable"; and this frog is cloathed with all the "terrors of an inqui&s;itorial monk, with knitted brow and angry look". In &s;hort old <HI>Proteus</HI> was a fool to our American &s;ecretary for variety of &s;hapes: that &s;lippery god could not a&s;&s;ume more than one at

a time; but here we find the &s;ecretary like a frog, and a monk, and looking as angry as the d&mdash;l, all at one in&s;tant: certainly if Major POWERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the Witne&s;&s;es interrogated.</NOTE> and the re&s;t of them had not been as wily as him&s;elf and as brave as Cae&s;ar, he would have extorted &s;ome|thing from them. But it was all labour lo&s;t: he never once re|flected that the whi&s;key-boys wanted true and real repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s; none of your &s;hams;&mdash;and that had they betrayed their candidates, a chamber in the Penitential Hou&s;e, or a hempen collar would have put them to the nece&s;&s;ity of choo&s;ing others not quite &s;o fit.</P>
<P>We come next to our author's elaborate defence of Iri&s;h ho|ne&s;ty&mdash;a ta&s;k equal in honor to that of Hercules, in clean&s;|ing the Augean &s;table&mdash;but as I always hated lengthy calcula|tions, and am &s;ure I &s;hould &s;oon grow tired of one applied to determine the exact number or proportion of Iri&s;hmen hanged in America, I leave this job to Porcupine. It is a national que&s;tion, and I dare &s;ay he can determine with mathematical pre|ci&s;ion, whether our author's calculation be exact or not. In the meanwhile I will be &s;o candid as to declare that we have more than a <HI>quantum &s;ufficit</HI> both of Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h rogues among us; though the natives of Hibernia are va&s;tly the mo&s;t numerous. What is the preci&s;e cau&s;e of the difference; whether the Engli&s;h make a &s;hift to hang mo&s;t of their own rogues at home, and the Iri&s;h &s;end theirs abroad, to propagate the breed, is hard for me to determine: but this I will &s;ay, for I love to give the devil his due, that, if war and ju&s;tice mu&s;t, for the good of mankind, have a certain number of victims in every country, we are mo&s;t indebted to the Iri&s;h for our &s;acrifices: and as, of cour&s;e, there is &s;ome merit in being &s;hot or hanged, as well as in labouring for the benefit of the world, in this re&s;pect, Hibernia, the palm is thine!&mdash;The preceding view regards only the moral cha|racter of the two nations, their propen&s;ities for picking of pock|ets or cutting of throats, but it is nece&s;&s;ary to do ju&s;tice al&s;o to their re&s;pective political talents, which the reader will &s;ee, if he has patience, in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Politics, however ab&s;tru&s;e a &s;cience it was formerly e&s;teemed,
<PB N="25" REF="030314_0023_0FE5B97A27FF26A8">
has been &s;o thoroughly explored by modern e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, and the knowledge has been &s;o thoroughly di&s;&s;eminated by tho&s;e laborious &s;ervants of the public, the editors of Gazettes, that every me|chanic knows more now about civil rights and duties, than LOCKE, HARRINGTON, or SIDNEY. Every barber can tell you, to a hair's breadth, how far the line of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion goes, and where the right of in&s;urrection begins; when the voice of the majority ought to govern, and when the minority have a right to interpo&s;e their <HI>veto;</HI> whether a government divided into three branches, or &s;preading, like a goo&s;eberry bu&s;h, all into branch|es, is be&s;t; whether the power of making treaties is &s;uperior to the power of breaking them, and whether they both exi&s;t to|gether, like the principles of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> in the Magian the|ology, always at loggerheads, or whether, like Ca&s;tor and Pollux, they live and die by turns; how to manage the freedom of the pre&s;s &s;o that, like a cogged die, it &s;hall always &s;hew one &s;ide only; and a thou&s;and other difficult and delicate que&s;tions, where the &s;hades of right and wrong meet, and almo&s;t run into one another. Although the pre&s;ent war is a conte&s;t for power among the leaders, with the people at large it is a mere war of opinions, and has been as zealou&s;ly maintained by the pen, as by the &s;word: rivers of ink as well as of blood have been &s;pilt on the occa&s;ion. But when the king and mini&s;try of Great Britain thought proper to check the ardour of one part of the&s;e quilled warriors, as &s;omewhat dangerous to their own government, the party and its friends were &s;o offended that they fled from England and Ireland, boiling hot with re&s;entment. And now, courte|ous reader, we come to di&s;criminate the political characters of the two &s;orts of emigrants.</P>
<P>The exiles from England have not been as numerous as tho&s;e from the &s;i&s;ter I&s;land; but what they have wanted in number, they have made up by &s;uperior qualifications for mi&s;chief. They are, generally &s;peaking, pupils of the Pari&s;ian &s;chool, whole-blood Philo&s;ophers, who think of nothing but cutting the throats of all the kings in the world, and e&s;tabli&s;hing an uni|ver&s;al republic over the whole, or having it cantoned into a number of &s;maller confederacies: there are others again who have &s;omething that they call religion, in their heads, the mad di&s;ci|ples
<PB N="26" REF="030314_0024_0FE5B97E83942EF8">
of BROTHERS, the mad prophet, and the&s;e look forward with joy to an approaching millenium. But however the&s;e two Engli&s;h &s;ects of revolutioni&s;ts differ in the object or end, they agree perfectly about the means. Two hundred years of de&s;truction and mi&s;ery, and an hundred millions of lives are nothing, if weighed in the balance again&s;t the extermination of Kings and Nobles. I have heard one of the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts re|joicing that he had e&s;caped from the tyranny of Great Britain, and &s;aying that he looked forward with rapture to the period, when the tower of London will be in flames, and the kennels running with blood: nothing, he &s;aid, cau&s;ed him &s;o much regret, as the thought, that he had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, by cutting the King's throat, before he left England.</P>
<P>Now, I acknowledge that there are not many of the Iri&s;h patriots of this dreadful breed. They are mo&s;tly a mon|grel race of reformers, neither &s;o deeply &s;killed in politics, nor &s;o very zealous about one form of government, more than another: they love liberty well enough, but could put up with a little tyranny, if the laws were not &s;o d&mdash;d &s;evere about the transfer of property; and to pay taxes for the &s;upport of tho&s;e very laws they think is more than fle&s;h and blood can bear. On the whole, I acknowledge that the Engli&s;h enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who&s;e heads in general are ab&s;olutely crazed, are much more to be dread|ed than the patriots from Ireland. One of tho&s;e blood coloured philo&s;ophers, with TOM PAINE'S <HI>Rights of Man</HI> in his hand, and a travelling guillotine by his &s;ide, would do more mi&s;chief in a month, than a brace of raggamuffins from Ireland, who only make free with a mans "hor&s;e or cow, from mere igno|rance," would do in half a century.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ettled, with the utmo&s;t impartiality, this very important que&s;tion between the two nations, for which I expect the thanks of the <HI>Emigration Society</HI> delivered by their Pre&s;i|dent, I will take my leave of them both, with this friendly advice; "cea&s;e vilifying the country you &s;prung from, whatever or wherever it be, it is a mark of a ba&s;e mind; and if you pre|fer this, &s;tay among us, and pur&s;ue &s;ome hone&s;t vocation with indu&s;try, leaving it to the natives to manage their own govern|ment, to their own liking, as they under&s;tand it be&s;t." When

a foreigner intermeddles with the politics of the country, he never fails to tinge it, as far as he is able, with his own national prejudices and attachments. If he has fled from the &s;everity or ju&s;tice of the laws of his former country, you di&s;cover his re|&s;entment in every thing that he either &s;ays or does, that relates to it. Such a man, if he even prints a copy of an Engli&s;h work, cannot &s;uffer it to pa&s;s through his hands, without tran&s;|fu&s;ing &s;ome of his gall again&s;t the nation or it's government, into his American edition. This not only betrays a mind, over|flowing with the malignant pa&s;&s;ions, but is an in&s;ult to the reader, who does not pay his money to know the editor's politics, but to obtain information or entertainment from the author.&mdash; Such a per&s;on I have in my eye, who looking round a book &s;tore one day, in &s;earch of a book, that would an&s;wer to be reprint|ed, at length made his choice, when this, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;oli|loquy took place:</P>
<P><Q>Mr. &mdash; &s;aid he, &s;uppo&s;ing the author to be pre&s;ent," you have publi&s;hed a very u&s;eful work, and may I add, in uni|ver&s;al demand, of which I intend to print an American edi|tion, with improvements. The&s;e improvements, except a few blunders of my own, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t principally of all the abu&s;e I can invent again&s;t your nation, and your government, for I never can love, or forgive either of them. The thought of them only, makes my blood to boil. May ten thou&s;and d&mdash;ls fly away with them all! ju&s;t before I left &mdash; I had like to have lo&s;t my ears on a pillory, for only mode&s;tly exciting the people to cut one anothers throats.</Q></P>
<P>This national bu&s;ine&s;s di&s;patched, we will now attend to the claims of Ma&s;ter SWANWICK, and if I know my own mind, I intend to do him equal ju&s;tice. It is of no importance to me, whether his father was a tide-waiter, or a waggon-ma&s;ter, or a Methodi&s;t teacher, or all three in one; whether the gentleman him&s;elf be the favorite of the ladies at t'other end of the town, or the topic of their diver&s;ion; whether he is content to mum|ble orations in the Senate or boarding &s;chool, in humble pro&s;e, or diverts him&s;elf at the foot of Parna&s;&s;us in pro&s;e run mad; whether he is mo&s;t vain of his fine Italian marble, and rich
<PB N="28" REF="030314_0026_0FE5B981CDFE2740">
paintings, or of his palace, where as in the Indian temples, the meane&s;t article of furniture, is the idol him&s;elf. I care not a farthing about all the&s;e things: they may all apply to a wi&s;e man or a fool, and in my e&s;timation neither add nor &s;ubtract from the real merit of the man. It is Mr. SWANWICK, the re|pre&s;entative in Congre&s;s, the bold and intru&s;ive public character that I intend to examine.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time he commanded my notice, was when on the State-hou&s;e ground in Philadelphia, he canva&s;&s;ed for a &s;eat in the State legi&s;lature. This was an unu&s;ual &s;ight: in all the elections for thirty years preceding I had never once &s;een a can|didate, pa&s;&s;ing off his own ticket. In that &s;pace of time I had known &s;ome ambitious men, and many weak ones, &s;oli|citous for &s;eats in the legi&s;lature, but mode&s;ty or &s;ome other old fa&s;hioned virtue generally kept them from the ground on the day of election, or if they attended, it was only as &s;pecta|tors, leaving it to their friends and well-wi&s;hers to take care of their intere&s;t. How &s;hall we account for this novelty? Shall we &s;uppo&s;e him vain enough to think him&s;elf above the common rules of decorum, or &s;tupid enough to de&s;pi&s;e them?</P>
<P>When by dint of art and indu&s;try he got into the hou&s;e, it might have been expected that, as repre&s;entative for the Metro|polis, one of the greate&s;t trading cities of the Union, in which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable real e&s;tate, and carried on an exten|&s;ive trade, her pro&s;perity would be the principal object of his care. But Mr. SWANWICK had no head for &s;peculations of this kind. The vanity of being of &s;ome con&s;equence in the &s;tate, was more ea&s;ily gratified, and by means at the &s;ame time le&s;s oppo&s;ed to his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, avarice. In con&s;equence of a quarrel with the &s;tockholders in the Bank of <HI>North-America,</HI> his fir&s;t &s;tep after he got into the Legi&s;lature was to obtain a charter for another Bank, under the au&s;pices of the &s;tate. To effect this, he united him&s;elf with a predominant party in the hou&s;e, which had always been adver&s;e to the pro&s;perity of the city and interior counties; and a large capital belonging to the &s;tate, was imbarked in the purcha&s;e of &s;hares in the new Bank. By this mea&s;ure he embraced two objects; the indulgence of his &s;pleen again&s;t the ancient bank, and opening a large field
<PB N="29" REF="030314_0027_0FE5B9840FD0BC90">
for &s;peculation as a &s;ub&s;criber, and afterwards as a director of the new; both which he has managed to great account. Thus the public money has been employed in the Jew trade of u&s;u|ry, in order to accommodate a few ambitious and daring &s;pe|culators; the commerce of city has not been enlarged by it, but engro&s;&s;ed by a few avaricious men, who were able to com|mand di&s;counts at any time, when others were refu&s;ed. It is reported that &s;ome of the&s;e very directors have di&s;counted notes at the extravagant rate of 3 pr. centum pr. month, with the very money they have obtained at the bank at 6 pr. cent. pr. annum.</P>
<P>The only honourable u&s;e of public money is public improve|ments, the melioration of the roads, the con&s;truction of bridges, opening of inland navigation, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a loan office: by the&s;e means the activity and benefits of the capital are diffu&s;ed and felt through every part of the community, not confined, as it di&s;gracefully has been, to a few avaricious indi|viduals. Part of this &s;ame &s;tock employed in the various ca|nals, and turnpike roads would have given labour to many thou&s;and hands, and enabled the farmer to carry his produce to market at a cheap rate, from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts; and ano|ther part lodged in a loan office for the u&s;e of both the farmer, and the mechanic, would have enabled them to pay off their incumbrances, and advance their own and the general riches of the country.&mdash;</P>
<P>On the contrary, men of public &s;pirit, who embarked in works of general utility, after &s;pending large &s;ums of their own money, have been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity either of lo&s;ing all that they had expended, or applying to the legi&s;lature, for per|mi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e more by a lottery to compleat them. Thus a ta&s;te for gambling, only one degree above that of the Faro ta|bles, has been &s;anctioned by law; and the people have been &s;educed from the hone&s;t pur&s;uits of indu&s;try, by the tempta|tion of making their fortunes by the turn of a wheel. And the&s;e things have taken place among men, who make a mighty parade about the nece&s;&s;ity and benefits of public &s;chools, and an improved education; as if it were po&s;&s;ible to make virtuous ci|tizens, merely by furni&s;hing their heads with knowledge, while
<PB N="30" REF="030314_0028_0FE5B989126A85F8">
their hearts are poi&s;oned with a &s;pirit of gambling and idlene&s;s. Indu&s;try and temperance are the two cardinal virtues, on which the pro&s;perity of a republic depends, and when they have fled, liberty and patrioti&s;m will &s;oon follow, however &s;cientifically men may learn to rea&s;on about them.</P>
<P>After this little puffing orator, by his crooked politics, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his tramontane colleagues, had di&s;graced the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania for a year or two, by &s;ome fa|tality or other he was removed to the legi&s;lature of the United States. Here he pur&s;ued the &s;ame perver&s;e &s;y&s;tem, and attach|ed him&s;elf to that party in Congre&s;s, which had always oppo&s;|ed the Federal Con&s;titution, and every &s;alutary act of govern|ment. His infamous conduct on the important que&s;tion of the Briti&s;h treaty is &s;o well known, that little more need be &s;aid a|bout him. A volume cannot convey more than his own confe&s;|&s;ion, when he &s;aid, Mr. MUHLENBURGH, who voted for the treaty had "&s;aved his country" although he, him&s;elf had &s;truggled with all his might, and even at la&s;t voted again&s;t it. Can words de&s;cribe more dete&s;table duplicity!&mdash;</P>
<P>From celebrating Iri&s;h hone&s;ty, the &s;incerity of Dr. FRANK|LIN, and the tran&s;cendant merit of little Ma&s;ter SWANSKIN, the author pa&s;&s;es, by a very natural tran&s;ition, to calumniating the great and good Pre&s;ident of the United States, the illu&s;tri|ous founder of Penn&s;ylvania, and the mo&s;t virtuous citizens of the Union in a lump; and his pen is equally well adapted to both offices, as an in&s;ect gorged with filth from a dung-hill flies and drops it of choice on the white&s;t garment. "To be ill &s;poken of by &s;uch a man, is conferring that &s;ort of honor, which it is alone within his competence, and which it is certainly mo&s;t congenial to his nature and his manners to be|&s;tow"&mdash;as to receive prai&s;e from him is the &s;ure&s;t proof that can be given, of inherent infamy in the object, on which it is be|&s;towed.</P>
<P>It &s;eems Dr. FRANKLIN cho&s;e to keep up the farce to the la&s;t. In his will he bequeathed a few trifling legacies, as me|mentos of his friend&s;hip, or, if you like the &s;tile of our au|thor better, as proofs <HI>"of the goodne&s;s of his heart, and a wi&s;h to part in peace with all mankind."</HI> To the Philadelphia Libra|ry,
<PB N="31" REF="030314_0029_0FE5B98AC91A71C0">
where his &s;tatue &s;tands in the front, like the pale monu|ment of Guilt, or like a Swi&s;s at the door of an hotel, he gave one old &s;ett of French works of little value; to the Penn&s;yl|vania ho&s;pital, the balances of his un&s;ettled accounts, provided the managers would undertake to <HI>pay,</HI> as well as to receive, which they prudently cho&s;e to decline; and to his worthy friend GEORGE WASHINGTON, he bequeathed his gold headed cane, &s;urmounted with the cap of liberty, adding, "if it were a &s;cep|tre, he is worthy of it." From this la&s;t article, this <HI>candid</HI> wri|ter infers, that the Doctor thought the Pre&s;ident always held "a &s;ceptre in higher e&s;timation than a liberty cap," and if he really did, I &s;hould e&s;teem it as a mark of his good &s;en&s;e: but it is very clear, from the only natural con&s;truction of the words, that the Doctor thought &s;o him&s;elf&mdash;for however the <HI>Bonnet rouge</HI> may fit the head of an emancipated Frenchman, or the <HI>pileum</HI> &s;uited the rabble of Rome, in celebrating their <HI>Saturna|lia,</HI> and qualified every blackguard to in&s;ult a Metellus or a Cato, the old fox had more wit than to think that the modern liberty cap was a real badge of honor: No! no! he had carried it him&s;elf, only as a ma&s;k, and thought proper to qualify this &s;an&s;culotte legacy to General WASHINGTON, by adding, "if it were a &s;ceptre he is worthy of it." But to &s;uppo&s;e that, be|cau&s;e he thought the General worthy of a &s;ceptre, as who is there that does not think &s;o, he a&s;pired to any higher dignity than that of Pre&s;ident of the United States, is not only an in|&s;ult to the office, but betrays a &s;oul overflowing with ingrati|tude.</P>
<P>The whole of his life, the forty years of faithful &s;ervices devoted to the good of his country; his retirement from the army at the clo&s;e of the war, when a di&s;contented &s;oldiery, who idolized their general, would have given him a &s;ceptre if he had cho&s;en it; his pre&s;ent &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the office of Chief Magi&s;trate, with univer&s;al love and e&s;teem, &s;o completely di&s;|prove this ba&s;e in&s;inuation, that it needs only to be mentioned, to excite general indignation again&s;t the author. But when it is known that this author is a foreigner by birth, every virtuous citizen will re&s;olve, that &s;uch an ungrateful mi&s;creant is unwor|thy of an a&s;ylum among us, and be ready to cha&s;e him back to

the ju&s;tice he fled from.

WILLIAM PENN, a name dear to all the <HI>real</HI> friends of civil and religious liberty, and venerated by the &s;avage tribes to this very day, for his upright and peaceable conduct in the fir&s;t &s;et|tlement of Penn&s;ylvania, is treated with the &s;ame illiberal free|dom as the great WASHINGTON: but it is natural, for ingrati|tude will ever pur&s;ue di&s;tingui&s;hed merit as its evil genius, as long as envy exi&s;ts in the world. Had this illu&s;trious Quaker lived in the ancient ages of Greece, he would have been rank|ed with the greate&s;t benefactors of Mankind, with MINOS, SO|LON and LYCURGUS: or had the Aborigines of this State been taught to believe in the exi&s;tence of tutelary Spirits, they would have canonized <HI>Brother Onas,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indian name for WILLIAM PENN.</NOTE> as their guardian &s;aint; and I believe in my &s;oul they would have invoked him daily, to pro|tect them again&s;t the red beards of Ireland, and all their attri|bute vices and vermin.</P>
