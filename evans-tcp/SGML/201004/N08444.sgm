<OPENER><SALUTE>REV'D SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A GENTLEMAN in this town, to whom Mr. Lea|ming's "defence" was lately &s;ent, &s;aw fit, a few days ago, to put it into my hands, de&s;iring I would give it a reading; which I have accordingly done.</P>
<P>How far it may be ju&s;tly called <Q>a defence of Epi&s;co|pacy again&s;t your &s;ermon,</Q> I am not able to &s;ay; not having had the plea&s;ure of ever &s;eeing it: But 'tis with great impropriety &s;tiled "a defence again&s;t mine;" as nineteen parts in twenty of what I had &s;aid, is pa&s;&s;ed over, without &s;o much as an attempt to examine its force, or &s;hew its inconclu&s;ivene&s;s in point of argument. Was it not that my name is now and then mentioned, no one would im|agine he had it in view to an&s;wer me, any more than an hundred others, who have appeared on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I ESTEEM my &s;ermon as full an an&s;wer to his "defence," as if wrote on purpo&s;e to confute it; and a&s;k no other fa|vour than that they be carefully compared with each other, and an impartial judgment formed thereupon. If this is done, I cant &s;uppo&s;e that any one, be&s;ides Mr. L. will be di&s;po&s;ed to think, <Q>that he has an&s;wered the mo&s;t material things advanced by Dr. Chauncy:</Q> It mu&s;t be deter|mined, on the contrary, that he has &s;carce taken notice of any thing material that I have offered.</P>
<P>I HAVE no other knowledge of this gentleman, than what may be collected from this &s;mall work of his; which has not, I confe&s;s, given me an exalted opinion of him. Was I inclined to engage in the epi&s;copal controver&s;y, I &s;hould choo&s;e for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a di&s;pute, than he appears to me to be. What good purpo&s;e would it &s;erve to write, tho' it were never &s;o
<PB N="iv" REF="010800_0003_0F81D1A7969D7978">clearly and &s;trongly, when one knows before hand, that little notice may be taken of what is wrote, and yet the whole be compleatly an&s;wered?&mdash;He has &s;aid but little, very little, but what has been an&s;wered an hundred times over, and with arguments much too powerful to be &s;et a&s;ide by him.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry your lot is ca&s;t among tho&s;e who are deeply tinctured with high-church principles. Such are always bigots them&s;elves, and zealou&s;ly endeavour to make others &s;o too. This was the ca&s;e among us in former years; but the&s;e high flying-notions are now almo&s;t ab&s;orbed in a more generous way of thinking. There are but few who dare openly profe&s;s their adherance to the&s;e tenets, whatever their private thoughts may be. 'Tis indeed high time they were univer&s;ally eradicated out of men's minds, they are &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s in them&s;elves, as well as contrary to the word of God.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the ca&s;e is circum&s;tanced with you, it may be well for you to take him to ta&s;k, and point out his weakne&s;s; which, as I imagine, you will find no difficult matter.</P>
<P>IT would be doing too much honour to him, for us both to be engaged in the di&s;pute with him: Tho' I believe it is in reality a di&s;pute with the combined clergy in tho&s;e parts. By the account I have of Mr. L. he is not equal to the performance that comes out in his name, however in|&s;ufficient it may be as an an&s;wer to either of us.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION, &amp;c. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I preached and publi&s;hed my di&s;cour&s;e upon ordination, I had no thoughts of engaging in a controver&s;y. Providence had ca&s;t my lot in that part of Chri&s;t's vineyard, where there are &s;undry epi&s;copalians, inter&s;per&s;ed among the people of my charge, as well as in the neighbourhood. Tho' I never could find any &s;cripture warrant, for the peculiarities that di&s;tingui&s;h that church from the re&s;t of the prote&s;tant world; tho' it has many defects in its orders, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and is con&s;i|derably different from the plan laid down by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, and followed by the primitive chri&s;tians in the next &s;ucceeding ages; yet as it appears to have the e&s;&s;entials of religion, it has ever been my practice to treat its profe&s;&s;ors as chri&s;tian brethren, tho' mi&s;taken in &s;ome points; agreeable to the apo&s;tolic direction, <Q>him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful di&s;puta|tions.</Q> A wrangling di&s;putatious temper among the di&s;ciples, e&s;pecially among the mini&s;ters of the prince of peace, is odious and unchri&s;tian. As the things in which we agree, are, by all allowed, to be of infinitely greater importance than tho&s;e in which we differ; how can that zeal be defended which &s;pends it&s;elf only, or principally, about the latter, while the former are treated with com|parative neglect? Is it not much more becoming the cha|racter of chri&s;tians and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to lay a&s;ide the&s;e bickerings, and unite our endeavours in oppo&s;ing the growing cau&s;e of infidelity and irreligion, and promoting the more important truths of our common chri&s;tianity? The&s;e are the principles agreeable to which I have ever
<PB N="vi" REF="010800_0004_0F81D1A893BFFFF0">treated our epi&s;copal di&s;&s;enters: And I challenge the whole party to produce an in&s;tance, in which I have ever begun a di&s;pute with them upon the controverted points, or attempted, publicly or privately, to prejudice them a|gain&s;t their own wor&s;hip or mini&s;try. I e&s;teem it a greater honour to promote the real intere&s;t of religion, than that of any particular denomination; and, if I know my own heart, had much rather be the happy in&s;trument of &s;avingly converting one &s;oul to Chri&s;t; than of making a thou&s;and pro&s;elytes, merely to the low de&s;igns of a party. It has ever given me pain, to ob&s;erve the prevalence of a con|trary temper and conduct, in tho&s;e of any denomination, whether clergy or laity. How far this has been the ca&s;e with the epi&s;copalians in the&s;e parts, would, perhaps, be deemed invidious in me to &s;ay. Sure I am, if I had not ob&s;erved too many in&s;tances of this kind; had I not been repeatedly &s;ollicited, to preach and publi&s;h upon this &s;ub|ject, as a nece&s;&s;ary antidote again&s;t the effects of them; the di&s;cour&s;e I am now called upon to vindicate, never would have &s;een the light. In compo&s;ing of it, I &s;tudiou&s;ly guarded again&s;t every thing offen&s;ive; for I had no de&s;ire to be drawn into a controver&s;y. Had I been di&s;po&s;ed to this, I could not have been at a lo&s;s for materials. It is well known, that be&s;ides the exorbitant, un&s;criptural claims of their bi&s;hops, and the mean, &s;ervile &s;ubjection of the pre&s;byters, in that church; there are &s;ome things in her articles, and in her wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline many more, which are, (at lea&s;t in our opinion) highly exceptionable. However naturally many of the&s;e things &s;ell in my way, while writing upon this &s;ubject, I carefully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them; for my maxim was to act only on the defen&s;ive, and endeavour, by &s;cripture and rea&s;on, to vindicate our mini&s;terial authority from the perpetual attacks of the party. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, I had rea&s;on to conclude, that the mo&s;t &s;anguine and zealous among them would not be offended, or look upon them&s;elves concerned to an&s;wer me, either from the pulpit or the pre&s;s. But no &s;ooner was the piece publi&s;hed, than the epi&s;copal pulpits, here
<PB N="vii" REF="010800_0004_0F81D1A893BFFFF0">and in the neighbourhood, re&s;ounded with the old cry, "the power, the power;" and repeatedly rung over all the various changes, of the <HI>nullity</HI> of pre&s;byterian orders and admini&s;trations, the ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>unalterable and divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy. And among the re&s;t, it was &s;aid, Mr. L. often di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf upon the topic, with &s;ingular pathos and zeal.</P>
<P>IT was &s;oon given our, that an an&s;wer to my piece would be publi&s;hed: But as no particular author was named, and the rumour abated; it was generally concluded, as they had no call to engage in the controver&s;y, the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. However, after a preparation of near three years, Mr. L. has &s;een fit to &s;tep forth, and favour the public with the fir&s;t fruits of his pen, in what he is plea&s;ed to call <Q>a defence of the epi&s;copal government of the church, containing remarks upon two late noted &s;er|mons, on pre&s;byterian ordination.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT I was to expect, from &s;uch an opponent, I was at a lo&s;s to determine; having never had a ta&s;te of his abilities for managing a controver&s;y. When the book came out, I read it with a good degree of attention; and was not a little &s;urprized to find, that after &s;o long prepa|ration, the author had &s;o little to &s;ay, upon the two pieces he had &s;et him&s;elf to an&s;wer. As to Dr. Chauncy's, the Dr. ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, nineteen parts in twenty are pa&s;|&s;ed over without a &s;ingle remark. And as to mine, who|ever compares it with Mr. L.'s an&s;wer, will, I am confi|dent, make much the &s;ame remark. Whether he has &s;o fully &s;ucceeded, in tho&s;e parts he pretends to an&s;wer, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the public, to which I appeal.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e and &s;uch like rea&s;ons, it was judged at fir&s;t, that to attempt an an&s;wer was no ways nece&s;&s;ary. But as the party &s;oon began to triumph in it, as an unan&s;werable piece, and boa&s;ted of great exploits done by it, in the ad|dition of &s;undry converts to the epi&s;copal cau&s;e; it was generally concluded, that &s;omething ought to be wrote by way of reply. This, I hoped, would have been underta|ken
<PB N="viii" REF="010800_0005_0F81D1A8F61C10E8">by Dr. Chauncy, as every way my &s;uperior, e&s;pecially in his acquaintance with this controver&s;y. But as he has declined the &s;ervice, for the rea&s;ons mentioned in his letter, prefixed to the&s;e &s;heets; it of cour&s;e devolves upon me.</P>
<P>AS I am con&s;cious of no other motive in the affair, than a &s;incere regard to truth, and the intere&s;t of our churches, which I really believe to be the intere&s;t of the redeemer's Kingdom; I &s;hall endeavour fairly to examine <HI>every thing</HI> in Mr. L.'s book, that looks like an argument, and give it its due weight. For as it is truth rather than victory I aim at: &s;o the former will &s;hine brighte&s;t when placed in <HI>contro&s;t</HI> with every thing that oppo&s;es it; and as to the lat|ter, he who &s;hould challenge it for only <HI>nibbling</HI> at here and there a &s;entence in his antagoni&s;t, mu&s;t I conceive, appear with a very ill grace. This, however, will make me more lengthy, than might otherwi&s;e be thought needful.</P>
<P>ONE thing I think proper to premi&s;e.&mdash;Since, not with|&s;tanding the caution u&s;ed, both by the Dr. and my&s;elf, to avoid a controver&s;y with epi&s;copalians, they have &s;een fit to engage in one; and will not &s;uffer us even to defend our cau&s;e, when called upon &s;o to do, without taking the alarm; I &s;hall not look upon my&s;elf holden to ob&s;erve the like caution, in that re&s;pect, as I did in my &s;ermon. If therefore in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute, I &s;hould happen to treat them with le&s;s ceremony: If there &s;hould occafional|ly drop from my pen, any direct reflections, or free ani|madver&s;ions, upon &s;ome very exceptionable and un&s;erip|tural parts of their &s;cheme, when they fall in my way, I reque&s;t the candid reader to impute it to the proper cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SEC. I.</HI> Remarks upon the letter-writer, S. I. and Mr. L.'s intro|duction.</HEAD>
<P>_MR. L. has u&s;hered his "defence" into public view, with a letter &s;igned, S. I. Who this gentleman is, we are not concern|ed to enquire. As he has &s;een fit to give us only the initial letters of his name, and no more ceremony than any anonymous writer, whatever honorary titles he may happen to be dig|nified with.</P>
<P><Q>OUR opponents, &s;ays he, have of late, without any provocation, been mu&s;tering up their old &s;ophi&s;ms a|gain&s;t the ancient epi&s;copal government of the church, which have been long ago abundantly an&s;wered over and over.</Q> Perhaps the gentleman thinks all argu|ments again&s;t his &s;cheme, de&s;erve the name of <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms.</HI> He &s;hould remember however, that, tho' to call an argu|ment that pinches, by an ugly name, may be an ea&s;y me|thod to get rid of it; yet in the judgment of the candid, a &s;olid refutation would be more &s;atisfactory. That our arguments are <HI>old,</HI> is readily granted; for &s;o is truth: But that they are the wor&s;e or the weaker upon that account, appears not. Nor does it appear that the&s;e arguments have been all abundantly, I mean &s;olidly <HI>an&s;wered.</HI> To pretend to an&s;wer an argument, is one thing; to do it effectually, another. The former, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we allow. The latter perhaps wants proof: We have only his bare word for it; and as he &s;eems to be an intere&s;ted
<PB N="10" REF="010800_0006_0F81D1A9CE6DA250">per&s;on, the public, and not he, will be pre&s;umed the pro|pere&s;t judge. But then, <Q>the&s;e &s;ophi&s;ms have been mu&s;|tered up again&s;t the <HI>ancient</HI> epi&s;copal government of the church.</Q> Had he &s;aid again&s;t the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> government of the church of England, as explained by &s;ome of her zealous &s;ons; the words would have read as well, and been more agreeable to truth. Every &s;ect, almo&s;t, is apt to boa&s;t of its antiquity; and if bare <HI>a&s;&s;ertions</HI> are admitted as proof, one has as good a claim to the honour as another: That the pre&s;ent government of the church of England, is <HI>epi&s;copal,</HI> none will deny: But that it is very <HI>ancient,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o <HI>ancient</HI> as &s;ome of its advocates pretend, is by many denied. As to my&s;elf, I am fully per&s;uaded, that not|with&s;tanding all its high pretences to antiquity; it is com|paritively a mere novel, up&s;tart in&s;titution. So far from being the true <HI>ancient</HI> epi&s;copacy, that prevailed in the apo&s;tles times, and the ages next following; that it is, in many re&s;pects, diametrically oppo&s;ite to it and de&s;tructive of it. This, I pre&s;ume, will appear in the following pages.</P>
<P>BUT after all, if we had attacked, even the church of England, without <HI>provocation,</HI> it was doubtle&s;s wrong. This is a charge commonly brought by our epi&s;copalians. Notwith&s;tanding the uncommon genero&s;ity, with which they are treated in this country, and the &s;ingular indul|gence of the &s;tate towards them, above what was ever &s;hewn to <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> in any part of the chri&s;tian world; they are often complaining of oppo&s;ition and ill-u&s;age. At lea&s;t, if we will believe them, they never begin a contro|ver&s;y. They are forced into it, in their own defence. This gentleman tells us, <Q>the&s;e opponents, (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, Dr. Chauncy and I) have of late been mu&s;tering, &amp;c. again&s;t the church, <HI>without any provocation.</HI></Q> Mr. L. &s;ays, <Q>I am fully per&s;uaded, upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, it will be found, that there cannot be one &s;ingle in&s;tance produced, for thirty years pa&s;t, in which our clergy have begun the di&s;pute."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defence p. 7.</NOTE> And, "When the church of England is <HI>attacked,</HI> her elergy &s;uppo&s;e they ought
<PB N="11" REF="010800_0006_0F81D1A9CE6DA250">to <HI>defend</HI> it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 8.</NOTE> His book is therefore called a <HI>defence,</HI> &amp;c. And this is the only rea&s;on that cau&s;es him to publi&s;h this <HI>defence.</HI></Q> But is this repre&s;entation hone&s;t? Are pre&s;byterians &s;uch quarrel&s;ome neighbours, as always to be <HI>attacking</HI> the church of England? and <HI>beginning</HI> the con|trover&s;y with her, <HI>without provocation?</HI> Nothing le&s;s. The fir&s;t piece wrote upon the controver&s;y, in this conutry, was on the epi&s;copal &s;ide. And the fir&s;t in this colony, by one with whom, I pre&s;ume, S. I. is intimately acquainted. What then can the&s;e gentlemen mean, by <HI>attacks</HI> upon the church of England? Had either the Dr. or I, denied her the e&s;&s;entials of a true church; had we di&s;puted the <HI>vali|dity</HI> of her mini&s;try;&mdash;pronounced a <HI>nullity</HI> upon her ad|mini&s;trations; &mdash;ranked her clergy among the &s;ons of <HI>Ke|rab,</HI> or her members with <HI>heathen Jews</HI> and <HI>infidels;</HI> or had we <HI>directly</HI> attempted to expo&s;e any of tho&s;e many things, which are, at lea&s;t, highly exceptionable in her doctrines, di&s;cipline, orders, and wor&s;hip; they might, with more propriety &s;ound the alarm, and cry, <Q>an <HI>attack</HI> upon the church.</Q> Every one knows, how common the&s;e <HI>cants</HI> are, from a certain quarter. But is there any thing of this kind in the pieces Mr. L. pretends to an|&s;wer? Certainly nothing. They bravely <HI>defend</HI> our mini|&s;try, from the exceptions of the&s;e zealous advocates for epi&s;copacy, who&s;e high-flying principles, lead them to anathematize all of our communion, and leave all the pro|te&s;tant world, but them&s;elves, to the uncovenanted mercies of God. According to the&s;e gentlemen, it &s;eems, there can be no defence of pre&s;byterian principles, however mo|de&s;t, without <HI>attacking</HI> the church of England. This is a great mi&s;take. Let but the church of England, even in her pre&s;ent form, be put upon her original and true foot|ing; &mdash;let her re&s;t upon the foundation, which the fir&s;t re|formers, and all her moderate and catholic &s;ons &s;ince, have fixed for her; I mean <HI>the civil authority of the King and parliament;</HI> and they never need &s;ear being <HI>attacked</HI> by us. A <HI>defence</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination and government, will
<PB N="12" REF="010800_0007_0F81D1AA712ABF08">be no direct oppo&s;ition to the church of England, in this view of it. Had there never been any higher claims for her, (and, to me, it is clear there never ought:) Had her &s;ons in this country, contented them&s;elves, with challeng|ing for her, the honour of being a valuable branch of the reformation, and of having the authority in England, en|gaged for her e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport there; I am con|fident, "the annual lecture in Cambridge," at which Mr. L. is &s;o much nettled, never would have had a being; nor the pieces he pretends to an&s;wer, have &s;een the light.</P>
<P>BUT the grand &s;ecret, no doubt, is:&mdash;The cau&s;e of epi&s;|copacy is to be pu&s;hed in America, at all events. And, upon trial, this, it &s;eems, has been found the be&s;t expedi|ent&mdash;to unhinge and perplex the minds of ignorant peo|ple,&mdash;to fill their heads with airy notions of the <HI>ab&s;oluts nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of epi&s;copal ordination, prejudice them again&s;t their own mini&s;ters, as having no <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> from Chri&s;t, no <HI>au|thority</HI> to perform the divine offices of religion, and boldly pronouncing <HI>nullity</HI> upon all their admini&s;trations. This is the general &s;train of all the pieces upon the controver&s;y, that have been wrote in this country. If this was not Mr. L.'s de&s;ign, he had no call to engage in the di&s;pute. This, however, is no new art. All oppo&s;ers of religion, have ever made their mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful attacks, thro' the &s;ides of its clergy. Thus did Korah, Dathan and Abiram. They fell upon Mo&s;es and Aaron, and denied their authority, as officers in God's church. <Q>Ye take too much upon you.</Q> The &s;cribes and phari&s;ees did the &s;ame in their oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tianity in its infancy. They <Q>compa&s;&s;ed &s;ea and land to make pro&s;elytes,</Q> they attacked the divine author of the go&s;pel, and boldly que&s;tioned his au|thority, as a public officer in the church. <Q>By what <HI>au|thority</HI> do&s;t thou the&s;e things? and who gave thee this <HI>authority?</HI></Q> The apo&s;tle Paul met with the &s;ame treat|ment. The Judaizing teachers, (who, by the way, were notable &s;ticklers for unin&s;tituted rites and ceremonies in religion,) traduced his character, denied his mini&s;terial au|thority, and in that way andeavoured to prejudice people's

<P><Q>FOR ten years, &s;ays Mr. L. before this, the church of England and <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> lived in a peaceful &s;tate: But &s;ince they have publi&s;hed &s;o many things again&s;t that church, it has a little di&s;concerted the de&s;ign of our clergy.</Q> If the "de&s;ign of their clergy" is to promote practical godline&s;s, and make converts to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I am at a lo&s;s to find any Thing in the books he &s;peaks of, tending to <HI>di&s;concert</HI> it.

<Q>THIS conduct of their mini&s;ters, &s;ays S. I. to his cli|ent, has made it nece&s;&s;ary for us to write again, in de|fence of the church; and I am glad, and thank you, that you have undertaken this office, and &s;o well acquit|ted your&s;elf in the di&s;charge of it.</Q> How well Mr. L. has acquitted him&s;elf in this <HI>office,</HI> mu&s;t be left to the reader. However if all our arguments are but <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms;</HI> e&s;pecially if they <Q>have been long ago abundantly an&s;wered over and over by others;</Q> 'tis no great purcha&s;e to do it again. But a &s;mattering of logic will &s;erve, to an&s;wer a <HI>&s;ophi&s;m,</HI> and detect its fallacy. And if in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this has been &s;o often done before, &s;ome perhaps may be ready to doubt, whether Mr. L. has not acted the <HI>plagiary,</HI> and only publi&s;hed the works of others, in his own name. Be&s;ides, if all our <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms</HI> have been &s;o often, &s;o abundantly an&s;wered before, what occa&s;ion was there for doing of it again? Not that I would detract from Mr. L.'s perfor|mance. It is really better than I expected from <HI>him;</HI> and, &s;o far as he enters into the &s;ubject, as good, I imagine, as the cau&s;e will well admit. After all, I can hardly think he has done quite &s;o much execution with it, as his friend &s;up|po&s;es. According to him, all our arguments &s;tand no more chance, before the formidable artillery of this mighty champion, than mere cobwebs or puffballs, before the mouth of a roaring cannon. <Q>They in&s;tantly vani&s;h into du&s;t and &s;moke.</Q> But no wonder: Since whatever <Q>plau&s;ible appearance they make, they are but mere cavils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEIR chief appearance of &s;trength, he adds, lies in the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter.</Q> This gentleman mu&s;t allow me to tell him, he here labours under a great mi&s;take. If he had read the pieces he makes &s;o free with, he mu&s;t have &s;een that, we argue the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination, from the one general commi&s;|&s;ion to mini&s;ters in the go&s;pel. As this commi&s;&s;ion be|longs to all Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, we think they mu&s;t be inti|tled to all the powers it contains; therefore to ordination which is one of the&s;e powers. We argue it, from all go&s;|pel
<PB N="15" REF="010800_0008_0F81D1AB2D612448">mini&s;ters being &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, in their or|dinary capacity, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the powers belong|ing to them, in that capacity, of which ordination is indu|bitably one.&mdash;We argue it, from there being but one kind, or order of mini&s;ters, to be found in the new te&s;ta|ment, &mdash;but one &s;et of qualifications required,&mdash;one general work or bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned,&mdash;and only one method of intro|duction into office, pre&s;cribed for them all. Finally, we produce, as we think, plain and expre&s;s in&s;tances, from &s;cripture, of ordination by pre&s;byters, properly &s;o called, which is more than our opponents have ever been able to do, for epi&s;copal ordination, tho' often reque&s;ted &s;o to do.</P>
<P>'TIS true, <Q>the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture</Q> is one of our arguments, and, we think, a good one. For if the&s;e names were ap|plied in common to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters at that time; if every &s;cripture pre&s;byter was really a bi&s;hop then, we &s;ee no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e now. At lea&s;t the in&s;tance he brings to convince us of our mi&s;take; to con|vince us, that tho' bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter were one office in the apo&s;tles times, yet they <HI>ought</HI> not to be &s;o now; does not &s;eem &s;o happily cho&s;en to prove the point, tho' it &s;erves well enough, to &s;hew how the alteration was introduced into the chri&s;tian church, the motives leading to it, and the means u&s;ed to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tance he produces is this.&mdash; <Q>They might, &s;ays he, with ju&s;t the &s;ame rea&s;on, argue and conclude, that Pompey and Augu&s;tus were of the &s;ame office, becau&s;e they were both called <HI>imperatores;</HI> when all the world knows, that within 50 years, (as the ca&s;e hath often been with other words,) a different &s;et of ideas was annexed to that word, from what it meant 50 years before: Which was plainly the ca&s;e, with the word, bi&s;hop, when the church came to be &s;ettled, &amp;c</Q> The truth of the fact he mentions, as to the Roman &s;tate, I readily al|low. Nor will I di&s;pute the propriety of the application. It has indeed, in this in&s;tance, (as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,) fared with the chri&s;tian church, much as it did with the ancient
<PB N="16" REF="010800_0009_0F81D1ABF192EEE8">Roman common-wealth. While Rome was free, and re|tained her happy republican form of government; the term, <HI>imperator,</HI> meant only an officer in the army, of equal authority with his brother officers of the &s;ame title. But when Julias Cae&s;ar, that grand u&s;urper, not content with the original honours and powers of his office, as general; but fired with unbounded thir&s;t of dominion, found means to de&s;troy the ancient form of government, and en&s;lave his country; then he appropriated the title to him&s;elf and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, and &s;o the word, <HI>imperator,</HI> in proce&s;s of time, came to &s;ignify, one of &s;upreme authority over all others, both in the army and &s;tate.</P>
<P>AND has it not happened, even &s;o, with the word, <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> in the chri&s;tian church? Originally it &s;ignified, <HI>barely</HI> a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, a &s;tanding officer in the church, only of equal power with the re&s;t of his brethren in the mini&s;try. But the church of Rome, in imitation of the &s;tate, have long &s;ince, de&s;troyed the original parity, that fir&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, and, together with the <HI>power,</HI> appropriated the <HI>title</HI> of bi&s;hop, in its highe&s;t &s;ignification, to the pope, the grand u&s;urper and en&s;laver of God's peo|ple, in &s;pirituals, and made him lord paramount, over all the officers and members in the church of Chri&s;t. And pity it is, that any prote&s;tant church, &s;hould &s;o far affect to ape and imitate them, as to adulterate the &s;criptural mean|ing of the word, bi&s;hop, to appropriate the title to a pre|tended &s;uperior order of officers in the church, as expre&s;|&s;ive of a lordly authority over their brethren in the mi|ni&s;try, who were all originally upon a level, as to power; all true &s;cripture-bi&s;hops. Is not this too much like &s;ym|bolizing with the church of Rome, the mother of harlots and abominations? Is it not too lightly departing from the &s;cripture patern, and treating with too much neglect, that &s;olemn caution, given by the great head of the church, to his mini&s;ters, <Q>be ye not called <HI>rabbi, ma&s;ter, lord;</HI> for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are <HI>brethren.</HI></Q></P>
<P>LET the candid reader now judge, whether there is not &s;ome weight in this argument, drawn from the <HI>identity</HI> of
<PB N="17" REF="010800_0009_0F81D1ABF192EEE8">"the names, pi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture" in &s;upport of pre&s;byterian ordination, after all this gentleman has &s;aid to defeat it?

<P>NOTHING of con&s;equence occurs in the remaining parts of this letter, but what we &s;hall meet with in the piece it ac|companies, and which will be there con&s;idered. He indeed tells us "they maintain" the ancient government of the church was epi&s;copal;" that Timothy was an in&s;tance of it at Ephe&s;us, and the apocalyptic angel another, &amp;c. &amp;c. To which he finally adds, the te&s;timony of the fathers, who, if we may believe him, were all upon their &s;ide of the que&s;|tion: And then &s;ays; <Q>They, (the fathers) mu&s;t have as well known the form, in which the apo&s;tles, under divine in&s;piration, e&s;tabli&s;hed and left the church; as we now know how ours was, in Q. Elizabeth's time.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer.</P>
<P>IT is not true in fact, that the&s;e ancient fathers, had &s;uch perfect knowlege of the original in&s;titution of the church, or that their writings in this ca&s;e are &s;o certainly to be de|pended upon, as his argument &s;uppo&s;es. If their writings are a &s;ure guide for us in one ca&s;e, they are in another. But 'tis well known the&s;e &s;ame fathers maintained the doctrine of
<PB N="18" REF="010800_0010_0F81D1ACD7535FE0">the millennium, and practi&s;ed giving the &s;acrament to in|fants; and moreover, declared that they received the&s;e things from the apo&s;tles them&s;elves. This they a&s;&s;art as fully, as they do the doctrine this gentleman cites them to prove. And yet his church, and ail others, for many hundred years, reject the te&s;timony of the fathers in the a|fore&s;aid in&s;tances, as being repugnant to the word of God. But further, granting his a&s;&s;ertion to be true, <Q>that the&s;e writers knew as well what form of government prevailed in the apo&s;tles times, as we do, what was the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the church of England in Q. Elizabeth's time;</Q> yet this will not prove that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of di|vine right. This gentleman, and other zealots of his par|ty, a&s;&s;ert, that epi&s;copacy in England, at the time of the reformation, was &s;ettled upon the foot of divine in&s;titution. Others, not only pre&s;byterians, but many eminent and learned epi&s;copalians, affirm the contrary: They deny it has any pretence of divine right in its original e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, but re&s;ts wholly upon the civil authority and acts of parliament, for its exi&s;tence in its pre&s;ent form. Now both of the&s;e opinions can't be true. If then we can't, at this day, certainly know, upon what footing the church of En|gland &s;tood in the reign of Q. Elizabeth; we certainly cannot know from the writings of the&s;e fathers, what was the apo&s;tolic in&s;titution of the church, even allowing that they knew it, as well as we do, what was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Q. Elizabeth and her parliament: For, it &s;eems, we are far from being agreed in that, and therefore don't certainly know it,&mdash;But what &s;poils the whole of this argument for epi&s;copacy, is that it takes for granted a fact which is not true. <Q>The fathers te&s;tify in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;co|pacy, therefore it is of divine in&s;titution.</Q> I deny the fact. It is &s;o far from being true, that any of the fathers of the two fir&s;t centuries, declare in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copa|cy, much le&s;s that this was the form of church government handed down to them from the apo&s;tles; that, on the con|trary, their writings unanimou&s;ly exhibit to view a form, diametrically oppo&s;ite to and ab&s;olutely de&s;tructive of, the
<PB N="19" REF="010800_0010_0F81D1ACD7535FE0">pre&s;ent dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, that prevails in the church of England. This I propo&s;e to prove in its proper place, to which I refer the reader.</P>
<P>HE goes on; "This was always <HI>my way</HI> of arguing." An&s;wer. Some men are ob&s;erved, to have a very odd and wrong-headed <HI>way</HI> of arguing, all their days. But barely its being <HI>their way,</HI> the <HI>way</HI> they have always been u&s;ed to, will not prove it to be a good one, or &s;erve to recommend it to tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to a better <HI>way.</HI></P>
<P>HE adds, <Q>ju&s;t in the &s;ame way do our di&s;&s;enting neigh|bours, with us, very rightly argue the cau&s;e of infant bap|ti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath; only they have not near &s;o many clear, inconte&s;tible facts, either of &s;cripture or antiquity, for them, as we have for epi&s;copacy; &s;o that they mu&s;t either give up <HI>them,</HI> or embrace <HI>that,</HI> or be &s;elf-condemned, as incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves.</Q>&mdash; I an&s;wer. There is, at lea&s;t in our opinion, much better evi|dence, both from &s;cripture and antiquity, in &s;upport of infant bapti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath; then for dio|ce&s;an epi&s;copacy. But if there were not, there is this ma|terial difference between us and them. They, from &s;crip|ture and antiquity, are convinced, as they tell us, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of divine in&s;titution, and therefore practice it. But then they virtually exclude all other chri&s;|tians, from the benefits of the go&s;pel, by denying the autho|rity of their clergy, and the validity of their admini&s;trati|ons, and leaving them in the deplorable &s;tate of heathen and infidels.&mdash;We, on the other hand, from the &s;ame te&s;ti|monies, believe infant bapti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath. We accordingly practice them. But then, <Q>we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t,</Q> as to think it our duty, either by our principles or practice, to unchurch and unchri&s;tianize all who differ from us in the&s;e points: But, if they are other|wi&s;e qualified, cheerfully admit their mini&s;ters into our pulpits, and their members to communion, in go&s;pel ordi|nances. We are content to enjoy our principles, without taking upon us to damn all who differ from us. Upon the whole then, we don't find our&s;elves greatly embarra&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="20" REF="010800_0011_0F81D1AD91687B60">this powerful <HI>dilemma,</HI> in which he means to entangle us, in order to draw us over to the church. We really think, notwith&s;tanding all he has &s;aid, we may &s;afely retain our old principles and practice, without incurring the character of &s;elf-incon&s;i&s;tency, in the judgment of the impartial, or &s;eeling the reproaches of &s;elf-condemnation in our own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>HIS letter concludes with the&s;e words.&mdash; <Q>Let us then faithfully adhere to the doctrine, government, and li|turgy OF THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH OF EN|GLAND, WHICH CERTAINLY ARE, AND HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE, THE MOST SCRIPTURAL, OF ANY NOW IN THE WORLD.</Q> A high encomium! and if ju&s;t, abundantly &s;ufficient to recommend his beloved e|pi&s;copacy to the good graces of all mankind. Let him only favour us with &s;ufficient proof of his a&s;&s;ertion, and we will, at once, quit our pre&s;ent way, and all in a body be|come cordial pro&s;elytes, to his mo&s;t excellent, truly apo&s;|tolic, and be&s;t con&s;tituted church in the world. Till then, he mu&s;t allow us a little to he&s;itate,&mdash;to con&s;ider who this pompous character comes from. Po&s;&s;ibly it may be ju&s;t. Of this, however, he has given us no proof but his bare word.&mdash;Perhaps he may have ob&s;erved, that it is no new thing for men to cry; <Q>The temple of the Lord, are tem|ple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are the&s;e</Q> All men are apt to like their own principles be&s;t, and en|tertain a partial fondne&s;s for their <HI>own way.</HI> And for aught I can &s;ee,&mdash;the cry, of <Q>THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH, THE MOST SCRIPTURAL, PURE, PRIMITIVE DOC|TRINE, GOVERNMENT AND LITURGY OF ANY IN THE WORLD,</Q> are words, that &s;ound as &s;mooth and harmo|niou&s;ly in the ear, and offer full as much conviction to the under&s;tanding of an impartial judge, from the mouth of any other enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;ectary, as from that of an epi&s;copal <HI>di&s;&s;enter</HI> in New-England.

As a fur|ther proof of which, in the beginning of the reformation, bi&s;hops actual|ly took out their commi&s;&s;ions from the king, and were promoted by his letters patent; the form of which, as bi&s;hop Burnet tells us, was, <Q>that the king appointed &s;uch an one to be bi&s;hop, during his natural life, or &s;o long as he behaved well, and <HI>gave him power to ordain, or de|prive mini&s;ters to exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and perform all other parts of the epi&s;copal function,</HI> and this they were to do, IN THE KING'S NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY.</Q> <BIBL>Burn. abridg. vol. 2. p. 178.</BIBL></P></NOTE> Or does he thing there is a contradiction between
<PB N="23" REF="010800_0012_0F81D1AE9FB67FF0">this &s;entence, and the other he pretends to quote from p. 50 of my &s;ermon? The words I there u&s;e (for he has not quoted them right) are the&s;e, <Q>Another argument made u&s;e of, &amp;c.&mdash;is, that the New-te&s;tament has actually ap|pointed three di&s;tinct orders in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, viz. that of bi&s;hops, &amp;c.</Q> Now let the candid reader com|pare the&s;e two &s;entences, and &s;ee if there be any contradic|tion: Or any thing that could provoke him to treat me &s;o rudely. In one I &s;ay, epi&s;copalians argue their three or|ders from &s;cripture. In the other I expre&s;s my hope that <Q>by one of tho&s;e orders, bi&s;hops, they mean &s;cripture bi|&s;hops.</Q> In the former, I a&s;&s;ert what they declare their belief in this ca&s;e to be. In the latter, I expre&s;s my cha|ritable hope of their hone&s;ty in &s;uch declaration. The&s;e were the <HI>hopes,</HI> the only <HI>hopes,</HI> I mentioned. But Mr. L. very politely replies, "I mu&s;t be &s;o free as to tell him he never <HI>hoped</HI> any &s;uch thing. In &s;ome ca&s;es, I would be far
<PB N="24" REF="010800_0013_0F81D1AEECF9C758">from calling his knowledge in que&s;tion. But how he could know my heart; how he could certainly tell, what I did, or did not <HI>hope,</HI> is beyond me to conceive. But he tells me, not only that I did not "<HI>hope</HI> &s;o"; but that <Q>I <HI>knew</HI> the <HI>contrary,</HI> to be true.</Q> Now if I <HI>knew</HI> the contrary to be true, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e it <HI>was</HI> true: Otherwi&s;e, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible I could know it to be true. But what, I a&s;k, is this <HI>contrary,</HI> which he &s;ays, I know to be true? Plainly this, <Q>that by bi&s;hops, epi&s;copalians do not mean true &s;cripture bi&s;hops.</Q> This, and nothing el&s;e, &s;tands op|po&s;ed, to what I declared was the matter of my hope. All therefore I am able to make of this <HI>remarkable</HI> &s;entence, is this. I had &s;aid, <Q>I hoped, by bi&s;hops, epi&s;copalians mean true &s;cripture bi&s;hops.</Q> Mr. L. denies they mean any &s;uch thing. I had declared, that when they talked &s;o much about the divine right of epi&s;copacy, I was charitably in|clined to think they were hone&s;t. But this gentleman plainly tells me it is no &s;uch thing. Since therfore he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know be&s;t, and will needs have it &s;o; I will grant I was mi&s;taken, as to him in particular; tho's as to others of his party, he mu&s;t allow me to entertain the &s;ame charitable opinion &s;till; at lea&s;t till they give me the &s;ame rea&s;on to alter it, as he has done in his ca&s;e. If this is not his meaning in <HI>the&s;e remarkable</HI> words of his; 'tis indeed difficult to &s;ay, what his meaning is. They &s;eem to have no meaning at all; and therefore (to u&s;e another of his courtly phra&s;es) <Q>they might have been left out, and his defence would have been as good as it is now</Q></P>
<P>Mr. L. &s;eems to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the <HI>length</HI> of my &s;er|mon. In pag. 30 he has the&s;e words. <Q>Tho' he (Mr. Welles) <HI>fleers</HI> about our preaching deacons; yet I be|lieve it is really true that Stephen preached as good a &s;ermon as Mr. Welles's <HI>divine right,</HI> &amp;c. tho' it was not &s;o long.</Q> I have examined the pa&s;&s;age, to which he refers in this remark, but can find nothing that looks like a <HI>fleer</HI> there. After giving an account of the in&s;titution of deacons, Acts 6. beginning, and an&s;wering the arguments they bring for their preaching; I have the&s;e words, <Q>Since
<PB N="25" REF="010800_0013_0F81D1AEECF9C758">therefore it plainly appears, that the&s;e deacons, were in no &s;en&s;e, go&s;pel mini&s;ters, but expres&s;ly appointed and &s;et apart to quite another &s;ervice; it undeniably follows that no order in the chri&s;tian mini&s;try can be founded upon this in&s;tance; and con&s;equently, that their pre|tended order of preaching deacons, has no warrant&mdash; from the word of God.</Q> Now what is there in the&s;e words, that looks like a <HI>fleer?</HI> It is true, I denied that <HI>preaching</HI> was any part of the &s;cripture deacon's office; and if after I had proved it was not, I called it, a <HI>pretended order,</HI> &amp;c. I can &s;ee nothing criminal in it, nothing that looks like <HI>fleering.</HI> The order of preaching deacons in the church of England, is either a <HI>real</HI> and &s;criptural, or a <HI>pretended</HI> and un&s;criptural one. The former he knows we deny. He knows it was the very thing I was then di&s;proving; and if, when I had, as I thought, &s;ufficiently di&s;proved it, I called it a <HI>pretended</HI> order, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on he had to be offended. I hope he would not have me call it a <HI>real &s;crip|tural</HI> order of the mini&s;try, when I did not believe it to be &s;o, and had proved it not to be &s;o.&mdash;But <Q>he believes it is really true, that Stephen preached as good a &s;ermon as mine, tho' it was not &s;o long.</Q> Po&s;&s;ibly he does; tho' why he believes it, he has not told us. Sure I am, the &s;cripture, to which he &s;o often appeals, furni&s;hes no evi|dence of it. That indeed gives a lengthy account of this <HI>protomartyr,</HI> but &s;ays not a word about his <HI>preaching</HI> as I can find. 'Tis true it &s;peaks of his <HI>di&s;puting;</HI> but then Mr. L. I pre&s;ume, will not pretend that all <HI>di&s;puting</HI> is <HI>preaching.</HI> He has <HI>di&s;puted</HI> again&s;t my &s;ermon; but he has not publicly told us, he ever <HI>preached</HI> again&s;t it, tho' others &s;ay he did at &s;undry places and times. Whether his <HI>&s;er|mon,</HI> upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, was <HI>longer</HI> or <HI>&s;horter,</HI> whether it was <HI>better</HI> or wor&s;e than mine, as it is of little importance, I am not anxious to know. Be that as it will, I do not &s;ee what great rea&s;on <HI>he</HI> had t&ograve; complain of the <HI>length</HI> of my &s;ermon; &s;ince long as it is, it has given him &s;o little trou|ble. For all profe&s;&s;edly attempts to an&s;wer of it, is only my fir&s;t argument, which being compri&s;ed in little more
<PB N="26" REF="010800_0014_0F81D1B00C7C1738">than two pages, could not, one would think, give him any great pain. Whether, it was the <HI>length,</HI> or the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the other arguments, that di&s;couraged him from meddling with them; as he has not &s;een fit to tell us, every one mu&s;t be left to conjecture for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE pieces Mr. L. attempts to an&s;wer, had <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> mentioned "the right of people to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters." This he has repeatedly remarked upon, tho' not directly connected with the main point; while &s;undry arguments that were, are pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed. What could be his motive for this, is difficult to gue&s;s. Perhaps he thought, &s;o long as people were left to claim and prize this invalua|ble priviledge; all he could &s;ay upon his <HI>divine-right</HI> and <HI>be&s;t-con&s;tituted-church,</HI> would be in&s;ufficient to draw them away from a communion, where this priviledge is enjoyed, to one where it it utterly denied. He attacks Dr. Chauncy upon this head, and &s;pends near two pages in endeavouring to di&s;prove it; and, as if that was too little, he falls upon it again in his remarks upon me. He demands of the Dr. <Q>Where we find in &s;cripture, this to be declared a part of chri&s;tian liberty.</Q> &amp;c. I pre&s;ume, &s;cripture pattern will &s;atisfy for proof of this point, &s;ince it is all they <HI>pretend</HI> to bring for epi&s;copacy, and much more than they are able to produce. And of this kind of proof there is plenty in &s;cripture. From the go&s;pel hi&s;tory it appears, that this was the univer&s;al practice in the apo&s;tles times. When the vacancy made in the breach of apo&s;tles, by the death of Judas, was to pre&s;ent, was taken in the ca&s;e; &s;o that when Matthias was appointed, he is &s;aid to be <Q>numbered with the apo&s;tles, <HI>by the common vote or &s;uffrage,</HI></Q> as it is in the original.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 1.26. SUNKATEPSEPHISTMAE.</NOTE> This is a plain matter of fact: And this &s;olemn tran&s;action in the beginning of chri&s;tianity, is a &s;tanding pattern for the church in all &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>I mentioned in my &s;ermon, the in&s;tance of the &s;even deacons, who are expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, "to be cho&s;en" by the church, <HI>by the whole multitude</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 6.5.</NOTE> Was it thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the vote of the church &s;hould be taken, in the choice
<PB N="27" REF="010800_0014_0F81D1B00C7C1738">of officers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was only to <HI>&s;erve tables;</HI> how much more, in the more important office, of mini&s;ters of the word and &s;acraments? As a further proof of this right, I ob&s;erved in my &s;ermon, that this was the manner, in which the elders, ordained by Paul and Barnabas were in|troduced: By the vote or &s;uffrage of the people, as it is in the original.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 14.23.

<P>THESE now are &s;o many &s;cripture examples, of the ex|erci&s;e of this right, by the primitive chri&s;tians. Hence it undeniably follows, that this originally belonged to the people; con&s;equently, to go about to rob them of it, is un&s;criptural and tyrannical. Dr. Chauncy mentioned a number of proofs from the fathers, in &s;upport of this right; and that even after the di&s;tinction between bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters took place. To the&s;e, many more might ea&s;ily be added, from the &s;ame quarter. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin one from Cyprian bi&s;hop of Carthage who flouri&s;hed A. D. 250. <Q>The people, &s;ays he, have the chief power of <HI>choo&s;ing</HI> worthy mini&s;ters, and refu&s;ing the unworthy.</Q> He adds, <Q>That it mu&s;t be received as a <HI>divine</HI> tradition, and an <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> ob&s;ervation."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;. 68.</NOTE></Q> The ingenious author of the enquiry into the con&s;titution, &amp;c. of the primitive church, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Sr. Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, abundantly proves, from numerous te&s;timonies, that this was the univer&s;al practice of the primitive church, for people to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ters. And indeed, the contrary practice, is &s;o repugnant to rea&s;on, to all no|tions of liberty, and the univer&s;al cu&s;tom in all other ca&s;es; that, one would think, nothing but the highe&s;t degree of prejudice, could reconcile people to it. Do not we e&s;teem it a priviledge to choo&s;e our civil rulers? and look upon the people, as in a degree of &s;lavery, who are utterly de|prived
<PB N="28" REF="010800_0015_0F81D1B08E40DD60">of it? Would we &s;ubmit, to have others choo&s;e for us, a lawyer to defend our property, or a phy&s;ician to take care of our health? and oblige us to improve the&s;e and no other? Certainly no. But if we are &s;o tenacious of our natural rights, where our temporal intere&s;t, and bodily health only, are concerned; how much more ought we to be, in things that relate to the health of our &s;ouls, our fu|ture and eternal intere&s;t? Surely as much more, as the lat|ter exceeds the former in point of importance. No wonder then Mr. L. con&s;idered the want of this, a very important objection again&s;t his favorite church; and tho' &s;omewhat be&s;ide his &s;ubject, &s;et him&s;elf &s;o zealou&s;ly to remove it. How far he has &s;ucceeded, I leave to the reader. But if he is not able, wholly, to vindicate his own church in this re|&s;pect, he &s;eems to think it &s;ome excu&s;e that others, and ours in particular, is in the &s;ame &s;tate. This &s;eems to be his meaning in the&s;e words. <Q>I believe if the matter be care|fully examined, it will be found, that the right of the New-England churches, to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters, is founded, not upon &s;cripture, but upon the law of the province, which declares who &s;hall be the patrons, in each pari&s;h to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters. As far as I have been able to under&s;tand this matter, the law of the province con&s;titutes the heads of the families to choo&s;e, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 16.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>HOW far Mr. L. <Q>has been able to under&s;tand this mat|ter,</Q> he mu&s;t know be&s;t. The <HI>defect</HI> of his under&s;tand|ing, it is not in my power to help. Whether it was for want of <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> certain, I am, the account he gives of this affair is not true. According to the law of this colony, (and I &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame in the re&s;t of New-England, where there is an eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;ta|bli&s;hment) the right of choo&s;ing a mini&s;ter, is declared to be, not in the heads of families exclu&s;ively; but in them and the members of the church, whether heads of families or not. Be&s;ides, this right is not founded, as he &s;uppo&s;es, in the law of the colony, any more than the obligation of any divine law, adopted by the civil magi&s;trate. The <HI>obli|gation</HI> in one ca&s;e, and the <HI>right</HI> in the other, is founded in
<PB N="29" REF="010800_0015_0F81D1B08E40DD60">&s;cripture. The civil law only recognizes the right, and protects people in the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of it. And all men acquainted with our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, know that we are &s;o far from having any thing to do, with what he calls "patrons, in each pari&s;h, to choo&s;e the mini&s;ter;" that mo&s;t people know nothing of the term, or what it &s;ig|nifies, and I hope, by experience, never may. The com|municants, and all others of our people, who vote in &s;ocie|ty-meetings for other purpo&s;es, have all free liberty to vote in the choice of a mini&s;ter. And that they may act with di&s;cretion in this important affair; they have opportunity to make trial of the candidate while he is upon probation. Was it then hone&s;t in Mr. L. to &s;ay, <Q>In the &s;ame way &s;o|cieties, corporations and particular per&s;ons, become <HI>pa|trons</HI> in the church of England?</Q> In that church, <HI>patrons,</HI> clerical or &s;ecular, choo&s;e the mini&s;ters for the people. In ours, he is cho&s;en by the church and people them&s;elves In the former the bi&s;hop, or &s;ome lay patron, who perhaps never &s;aw the candidate, and is never to &s;it under his mini|&s;try, has the &s;ole power of electing. In the latter, he is elected by the votes of tho&s;e who have made trial of him, are to maintain him, and attend upon his admini&s;trations. In our method, the law acknowledges the natural and &s;crip|tural right of the people in this important affair, and pro|tects them in the enjoyment of it. But in theirs, in defiance of both, their mini&s;ter is <HI>obtruded</HI> upon them without their con&s;ent. If therefore, in this view of the ca&s;e, <Q>that good gentleman," (as Mr. L. calls the Dr.) &s;hould really think their church, &s;omewhat culpable in the matter of <HI>patrons;</HI></Q> few people, I pre&s;ume, "would greatly wonder at it," &s;ave he and tho&s;e of his party; and if, as he &s;ays, <Q>their church appears to him to &s;tand clear of all blame in that matter;</Q> it mu&s;t be owing, I think, to prejudice and partiality in a very high degree.</P>
<P>I FIND but one thing more, in Mr. L.'s book, proper for this &s;ection. And that is, the <HI>uncommon</HI> adverti&s;ement tacked to the end of it. I have read it over &s;undry times, but can't be certain I have hit upon his meaning after all.
<PB N="30" REF="010800_0016_0F81D1B144FBE100">He talks much about <HI>con&s;equences;</HI> cautions his an&s;werer again&s;t "falling upon <HI>con&s;equences,</HI>" and declares that <Q>he has no concern with <HI>con&s;equences.</HI></Q> What he intends by them, is difficult to &s;ay. A <HI>con&s;equence</HI> in logic, is an e&s;&s;en|tial part of every good argument.

And yet this or &s;omething like it, mu&s;t be his meaning too; for he warns his antagoni&s;t again&s;t "flying from the &s;ubject, or what he has advanced in "his book" and <Q>falling upon the <HI>con&s;equences.</HI></Q> But if this be his meaning, he need give him&s;elf no trouble in the ca&s;e, provided he has only been careful, "to advance" nothing but truth: For truth is ever con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; and nothing but truth will follow from it, or be the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of it, and this can do him no hurt.

As the doctrine of celibacy in his church, forbid his marrying of her, they agreed to quit their country and run off to New-York.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Animadver&s;ions upon Mr. L.'s preliminary remarks to page <HI>10.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I FULLY agree with our author; <Q>That it nearly con|cerns us to know who are the lawful mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom.</Q> And am well plea&s;ed with the me|thod he has propo&s;ed to decide this point, viz. <Q>by an appeal to &s;cripture and rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>IN the mean time, let us attend to the ob&s;ervations he thinks proper to make, previous to his entering upon this deci&s;ion. His fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is this. <Q>The whole body of di&s;&s;enters, (pre&s;byterians he means) affirm, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office: Yet they &s;ay, no in&s;tance is to be found there of an ordina|tion, by any per&s;on under the name <HI>bi&s;hop:</HI> And if a pre&s;byter is the &s;ame office, then there is none by a pre&s;|byter.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE> But now, who does not &s;ee the fallacy of this argument? He allows, with us, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office; that mini&s;ters were promi&s;cuou&s;ly called by both the&s;e names, in go&s;pel times. But then he holds, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordination, &amp;c. ought not to lie in common, to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters; but to be confined to a particular order, which in their church, are called bi&s;hops. We, on the contrary affirm, that as bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office; the power of ordination belongs in common to all mini&s;ters, and therefore ought not to be confined to &s;ome few, under the title of bi&s;hops. To prove this, we ob&s;erve, that tho' we have &s;undry accounts of ordination, in &s;cripture, per|formed by mini&s;ters, yet there is no &s;ingle in&s;tance of one &s;o performed by them, under the name <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> and yet to
<PB N="33" REF="010800_0017_0F81D1B1EBC4E908">this, epi&s;copalians appropriate the whole power of ordina|tion. But Mr. L. &s;ays, if this be true, that there is no ac|count in &s;cripture of an ordination performed by any per|&s;on under the name bi&s;hop, then it will follow,&mdash;What? Why "that there is none by a pre&s;byter," that is, no in|&s;tance of one performed by a pre&s;byter. But does it at all follow, that becau&s;e the &s;cripture mentions no ordination as performed by mini&s;ters under their one title of bi&s;hops, therefore there is no in&s;tance to be found there of their or|daining under their other title, that of pre&s;byters? Or thus, becau&s;e the &s;cripture never calls mini&s;ters by one of their common names, i. e. bi&s;hops, when acting in ordina|tion; is it a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence that it never calls them by their other common name, pre&s;byters, when acting in that bu&s;ine&s;s? Is it not po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame office in &s;crip|ture, may be commonly denominated and known by either of the names, bi&s;hop or pre&s;byter indifferently, and yet only one of the&s;e names, con&s;tantly u&s;ed and applied to him, when acting in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordination? But now this is what his argument proves, or el&s;e it proves nothing. The truth is, he has, either ignorantly or de&s;ignedly, alter|ed the terms in his &s;yllogi&s;m, &s;o that his conclu&s;ion contains more in it than his premi&s;es, which all logicians call, fal&s;e rea&s;oning. His argument reduced to mode and figure, runs thus, <Q>Bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture &s;ignify the &s;ame office. No in&s;tance is to be found there of ordina|tion by any per&s;on under the name of bi&s;hop</Q> This is his major and minor propo&s;ition. His conclu&s;ion is,&mdash; <Q>Therefore there is no in&s;tance of an ordination perform|ed by a pre&s;byter.</Q> Whereas, had he kept to the terms in his minor propo&s;ition, his conclu&s;ion mu&s;t have been, "Therefore there is no in&s;tance of an ordination performed "<HI>by any per&s;on under the name pre&s;byter.</HI> Had he done this, his readers would at once have &s;een the weakne&s;s and fal|lacy of his argument.</P>
<P>IN England. bi&s;hop, and lord-&s;piritual are &s;ynonimous terms. Now &s;hould I undertake to prove, that there is no account in the engli&s;h hi&s;tory, of an ordination performed
<PB N="34" REF="010800_0018_0F81D1B59CA04710">by a bi&s;hop, and in order to it, make u&s;e of this argument. &mdash;Bi&s;hop and lord-&s;piritual &s;ignify the &s;ame office: But there is no account in hi&s;tory, of an ordination performed by any per&s;on under the title of lord-&s;piritual; therefore there is no account of one performed by a bi&s;hop; and from hence &s;hould infer, the invalidity of epi&s;copal ordina|tion; Mr. L. I pre&s;ume, would hardly allow the argu|ment to be good. And yet it is the &s;ame he has u&s;ed in this ca&s;e, and full as conclu&s;ive. However, weak as it is, it &s;eems it wrought full conviction in his mind: For he tells us <Q>he is fully per&s;uaded, at that time in which the &s;criptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini|&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom, but tho&s;e only, who <HI>in &s;crip|ture,</HI> are called <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 9.</NOTE> But then what becomes of bi|&s;hop Timothy? Mr. L. has &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of his book in attempting to prove, the divine right of epi&s;co|pacy, from the in&s;tance of Timothy bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us. Yea it is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible argument, and indeed the only thing in his piece that de&s;erves the name of an argument. But if <Q>none had power to ordain mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom, but tho&s;e only, who are <HI>in &s;cripture</HI> called <HI>a|po&s;tles,</HI></Q> Timothy certainly had no power to ordain, for he is never once called an <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> in the whole &s;cripture, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion more particularly to &s;hew anon: Con|&s;equently all pretence to &s;upport his &s;cheme from this ar|gument is to no purpo&s;e. Tho' therefore I might now fairly di&s;mi&s;s the controver&s;y, as decided in our favour by his own confe&s;&s;ion; Yet not to take advantage of this in|con&s;i&s;tency of his, I &s;hall con&s;ider the argument when I come to it. In the mean time I intirely agree with him in what follows in this paragraph: "That the bi&s;hops in the church of England, do not an&s;wer, to tho&s;e that are promi&s;cuou&s;ly called, either bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters <Q>in &s;crip|ture.</Q> I add, neither do they, to any order in&s;tituted in &s;cripture. Dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, &s;uch as obtain in that church, are &s;o far from being of divine in&s;titution, that they are doubtle&s;s <HI>mere creatures of the &s;tate,</HI> what the go&s;pel knows nothing of,</P>

AND &s;o I am ready to attend upon his next ob&s;ervation, which is this, <Q>That di&s;&s;enters (pre&s;byterians he &s;hould have &s;aid) are not agreed among them&s;elves about the orders of the mini&s;try,&mdash;&s;ome holding to one order, others to two, and others again to three, &amp;c.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 9.</NOTE> But what then? &s;hall we mend the matter, in point of unity, or in the lea&s;t better our&s;elves, by going over to the church of England?

His words are, <Q>The nece&s;&s;ity of polity, and regimen, in all churches, may be held, without holding any one certain form to be nece&s;&s;ary in them all; and the general principles are &s;uch, as do not particularly de&s;cribe any one, but &s;undry forms of di&s;cipline may be equally con&s;i&s;tent with the general axioms of &s;cripture.</Q>

The words are the&s;e, <Q>In the new te&s;tament there is no mention of any other degrees or di&s;tinctions in orders, but of deacons or mini&s;ters, and presbters or bi&s;hops.</Q>
<BIBL>Burn. Hi&s;t. Refor. Vol. 1 p. 324.</BIBL></NOTE> This has always been the opinion of the more moderate e|pi&s;copalians in England; and therefore tho' they conform to the church of England, they do it, not as being of divine in&s;titution, but as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king and parliament. And others, with Mr. L. and his flighty brethren, a&s;&s;ert the three orders of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons, as of divine appointment: The&s;e plead the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;co|pal ordination, and reject all the prote&s;tant world who are without it. I might add, that there have been other advo|cates for prelacy, who have pleaded, with equal zeal, for the &s;everal orders of acolyths, lectors, &s;ubdeacons, archdeacons, chiroepi&s;copi, archbi&s;hops, patriarchs, and the Roman hi|erarchicks,
<PB N="36" REF="010800_0019_0F81D1B65513C468">for the pope, as Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, at the head of all.&mdash; <Q>We may &s;ee then, (to u&s;e his own phra&s;e) the que&s;tion under debate, cannot be decided by the&s;e men; for they are not agreed among them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>BUT how does he prove "that di&s;&s;enters are not agreed" in this point? Why he tells us, <Q>&s;ome never ordain their deacons," and the&s;e of cour&s;e "hold, that Chri&s;t has ap|pointed but one order, pre&s;byters.</Q> But how does this follow? He him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es the bi&s;hop is a different or|der in their church, and appointed by Chri&s;t. And yet, as far as I can learn, he has properly no new ordination when appointed bi&s;hop, but only what they call a con&s;ecration to the epi&s;copal office. Tho' therefore &s;ome of our churches &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ince the civil magi&s;trate now takes care of the poor, which, in times of per&s;ecution, was the deacon's bu|&s;ine&s;s, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of a formal ordination to that office; it will by no means infer a denial of his being an officer in the church, of divine appointment. We all, I pre&s;ume, are agreed that the deacon is an officer of divine appointment, (tho' not in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, as Mr. L has it, but by his apo&s;tles:) and that, whether we ordain him or not. He was therefore quite mi&s;taken in affirming, that we hold to but one order of officers as of divine appoint|ment.</P>
<P>BUT then if &s;ome <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> hold to but one, and others to two, there are others again, he tells us, <Q>that hold to three orders of mini&s;ters in the kingdom of Chri&s;t.</Q> And for this he quotes Mr. Calvin. But how came Cal|vin, pray, to be a <HI>di&s;&s;enter?</HI> He was indeed a <HI>di&s;&s;enter</HI> from the church of Rome: And (I hope) &s;o is Mr. L. too. But from the church of England he never was a <HI>di&s;&s;enter,</HI> for he never belonged to it. Our epi&s;copalians, indeed, warmly contended, in years pa&s;t, that the church of England e&s;tabli&s;hment extends to America, and con&s;equently that all who refu&s;e to conform to it, are <HI>di&s;&s;enters.</HI> But the highe&s;t &s;ticklers for uniformity among them, never, that I know of, pretended to carry the claim to <HI>Geneva,</HI> before Mr. L. It &s;eems his head is &s;o turned again&s;t <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="010800_0019_0F81D1B65513C468">&s;ince he has renounced our communion, and become a pre|late&s;t, that he is ready to fa&s;ten the approbrious character, upon every one, who happens to differ from him. Be&s;ides, according to him, Calvin was no di&s;&s;enter; for he held to the three orders of "bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons." I have examined the place in Calvin's in&s;titutions, from whence Mr. L. pretends to make his quotation, and boldly affirm there are no &s;uch words there. The &s;entence truly quoted, is this, <Q>As we have declared that there are three &s;orts of mini&s;ters commended unto us in &s;cripture; &s;o all the mini&s;ters that the old church had, is divided into three orders.</Q> Then follows; not <Q><HI>bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters and deacons,</HI> as added by our author: But the&s;e words; For out of the order of elders, were partly cho&s;en <HI>pa&s;tors and teachers;</HI> the re&s;t of them had the rule of judgment, and correction of manners. To the <HI>deacons</HI> was committed the care of the poor, and the di&s;tributing the alms.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calv. in&s;t. lib. 4. c. 4. &s;ec. 1.</NOTE> This plainly &s;hews what Calvin's judgment was: That be|&s;ides pa&s;tors and deacons, there was the office of ruling el|ders, as practi&s;ed in the church of Scotland. But now what is this to "bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters and deacons," as quoted by Mr. L.? This is not the only time, he has u&s;ed the free|dom with the authors he pretends to quote, of making them &s;peak what they never intended.</P>
<P>BUT he tells us, <Q>In &s;cripture we find mention made of <HI>apo&s;tles, pre&s;byters,</HI> and <HI>deacons,</HI> and why they &s;hould be &s;o carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed when ever they are mentioned in &s;cripture, if there was not a &s;ubordination in their of|fice, &s;eems very &s;trange.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>p.</HI> 9:</NOTE>&mdash;An&s;wer. Barely the&s;e names being mentioned, or even <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> in &s;cripture, will not prove, that they mean different orders in the church, of &s;tanding continuance. If &s;o, we &s;hall find, not only <HI>three,</HI> but <HI>five</HI> orders in &s;cripture. There we are told, <Q>that when Chri&s;t a&s;cended, he gave, not only apo&s;tles and prophets and evangeli&s;ts, but al&s;o pa&s;tors and teach|ers.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.10.</NOTE> Here are five different names of church-officers mentioned and the&s;e <HI>as particularly</HI> and <HI>carefully di&s;tingui&s;h|ed,</HI> as tho&s;e he has mentioned: And if to the&s;e we add,
<PB N="38" REF="010800_0020_0F81D1B7278E6F30">pre&s;byters and deacons, two of the number mentioned by him, and which are not included in the above five; we &s;hall, in&s;tead of <HI>three,</HI> have no le&s;s than <HI>&s;even</HI> different or|ders, all as <HI>particularly mentioned</HI> and as <HI>carefully di&s;tingui&s;h|ed</HI> as tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> mentioned by him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, that there is mention made, in &s;cripture, of apo&s;tles, presbyters and deacons, is readily granted. 'Tis further conceded, that presbyters and deacons, &s;ignify two di&s;tinct offices in the church. Finally, it is allowed, that apo&s;tles are &s;uperior to them both. But then they are &s;o, only con&s;idered in their extraordinary character, as apo&s;tles, in which, as I &s;hall &s;hew more fully hereafter, they have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and &s;o all that remain are only the presbyters and deacons, about which there is no di&s;pute.</P>
<P>HE goes on.&mdash;<Q>Let it be carefully remarked, that tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;end others, were called <HI>apo&s;|tles,</HI> in the time when the new-te&s;tament was penned.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 10.</NOTE> But then what becomes of Timothy and Titus again? His main argument for the bi&s;hop's &s;ole power of ordination, depends upon Timothy and Titus, being the bi&s;hops at Ephe&s;us and Crete. But as they are never called <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> in &s;cripture; it mu&s;t unavoidably follow, either, that they never were bi&s;hops, and &s;o his main argument for epi&s;copa|cy is demoli&s;hed: Or if they were, then what he here &s;o often affirms, is not true.</P>
<P><Q>THE word bi&s;hop, he tells us, being u&s;ed to expre&s;s the <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> no more altered the office, than the word, <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> altered the profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>believers.</HI></Q> Grant|ed. But then there is this material difference in the two ca&s;es: The latter was done in the apo&s;tles times: The for|mer, by his own confe&s;&s;ion in times po&s;terior. The name, <HI>believer,</HI> was changed into that of <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> by divine in&s;pi|ration.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 11.26. CHREMATISAI.</NOTE> Whereas no &s;uch heavenly warrant is pretended for changing the name <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> into <HI>bi&s;hop.</HI> If he will but ju&s;t reconcile this <HI>material</HI> difference; I will allow the two ca&s;es to be parrallel. Till then, he mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I think his compari&s;on nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT he goes on to tells us, in his margin, from Eu&s;ebius
<PB N="39" REF="010800_0020_0F81D1B7278E6F30">and Theodoret, that bi&s;hops are the apo&s;tles &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &mdash; I an&s;wer. If he only means that they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to them, in their ordinary capacity, as go&s;pel mini&s;ters, we have no di&s;pute with him, upon that head. In that &s;en&s;e, we main|tain that all go&s;pel mini&s;ters are &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, as I largely &s;hewed in my &s;ermon.

<P>BEFORE I enter upon a vindication of the Dr's &s;ermon, from the exceptions of another, it concerns me to do him ju&s;tice, in one particular, in which I have, inadver|tently, mi&s;repre&s;ented him my&s;elf.</P>

<PB N="40" REF="010800_0021_0F81D1B732F96488">&s;trongly, and as con&s;tantly, <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h bi&s;hops from pre&s;|byters,</HI> as any of the writings of the third and fourth centuries.</Q> Now all that the Dr. a&s;&s;erts is, that the&s;e epi&s;tles <HI>point out a di&s;tinction of order between bi&s;hop and pre&s;|byter:</HI> And upon reading what Mr. Boy&s;e has wrote, in his "clear account of the ancient epi&s;copacy," in which he has every thing contained in the&s;e epi&s;tles, relative to the &s;ubject; I am fully convinced, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e epi&s;tles, even in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of them, is very different from the <HI>dioce&s;an bi&s;hop.</HI> The Ignatian bi&s;hop, was merely a parochial one, having no more than a &s;ingle congregation for his charge, with presbyters under him: Whereas the dioce&s;an one, has many &s;cores or hundreds of &s;uch congregations in his cure. The interpolations and adulterations in the&s;e epi&s;tles, were doubtle&s;s made, before the bi&s;hops power was inlarged, &s;o as to comprehend a num|ber of pari&s;hes in his dioce&s;s.&mdash;Having thus corrected my own mi&s;take; I proceed to perform the &s;ame friendly office as to Mr. L.</P>
<P>AS a direct proof of ordination by presbyters, the Dr. had mentioned, the in&s;tance of Saul and Barnabas being &s;eperated to the work of the mini&s;try, by certain prophets and teachers, as recorded, Acts XIII. beginning. As this is &s;o very expre&s;s and circum&s;tantial an account, of a &s;epa|ration to the work of the mini&s;try; as all the &s;olemn acti|ons, contained in ordination, are here &s;o particularly men|tioned; and as this is &s;aid to be done, not by apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops, but by the ordinary pa&s;tors of the church, here called prophets and teachers; Mr. L. &s;eems to be at a lo&s;s what reply to make to it. He, at fir&s;t, &s;eems to be doubt|ful as to the nature of this action; at a lo&s;s what name to give it. "If, &s;ays he, this was an ordination:"&mdash;<Q>If this was a <HI>real</HI> ordination, then,</Q> &amp;c. Finally, he denies it to be an ordination. <Q>Whatever is meant, &s;ays he, by this de&s;ignation, it was not an ordination.</Q> <Q>In truth this was not an ordination.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 11.</NOTE> He found him&s;elf &s;o pre&s;|&s;ed with this in&s;tance, that he had no way to get rid of the argument, but by flatly denying it to be an ordination.
<PB N="41" REF="010800_0021_0F81D1B732F96488">And indeed, this was the only cour&s;e he could take to &s;up|port his &s;cheme. For if this be once granted to be a real ordination, the indi&s;putable right of pre&s;byters, to act in this bu&s;ine&s;s, is firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all pretences of con|fining of it to a &s;uperior order, mu&s;t be given up. I &s;hall therefore offer a few ob&s;ervations, to prove that this was, in fact, an ordination; and then make &s;ome remarks upon Mr. L.'s objections again&s;t its being con&s;idered as &s;uch.</P>
<P>NOW by ordination, I conclude, is meant, a &s;olemn &s;e|peration, or &s;etting a part to an office in the church, by &s;uch as have authority to do it, and that, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e rites or actions, the &s;cripture has appointed in this ca&s;e. The &s;cripture rites of ordination, are fa&s;ting, prayer, and the impo&s;ition of hands. In this way the &s;even deacons were introduced into office,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 6 6.</NOTE> which Mr. L. owns to be an ordi|nation. In the &s;ame way Timothy was ordained<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 14.</NOTE> And in the &s;ame way he is directed to ordain others.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v 22.</NOTE> And this has been the general method of introducing men into the mini&s;try, in all &s;ub&s;equent ages. But now, all the&s;e things concurred in the in&s;tance under con&s;ideration. The per|&s;ons acting in it, were church officers of Antioch, <Q><HI>prophets and teachers.</HI></Q> What they undertook to do was to <Q><HI>&s;epe|rate</HI> Saul and Barnabas to the work of the mini&s;try, a|mong the gentiles.</Q> This was done by the direction of the holy Gho&s;t; <Q>&s;eperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work whereunto I have called them;</Q> that is, to the work of the mini&s;try, e&s;pecially among the gentiles, <Q>to whom they were now &s;ent.</Q> The thing therefore to be done, beyond di&s;pute, was to &s;eperate the&s;e two men to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. How this was done, the ac|count inform, us; <Q>For when they had fa&s;ted 'and prayed and laid their hands on them, they &s;ent them away.</Q> As every action, every circum&s;tance pertaining to an ordi|nation, is here &s;o very particularly and expres&s;ly found; if, after all, this was not an ordination, I di&s;pair of ever finding one, in &s;cripture of any where el&s;e. And what &s;till further confirms the matter, if it needs further confir|mation, is, that if I am not much mi&s;taken, the apo&s;tle Paul
<PB N="42" REF="010800_0022_0F81D1B81C868550">him&s;elf acknowledges it to be &s;o. In his in&s;cription of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, chap. 1. v. 1. he has the&s;e words, <Q>Paul a &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, called to be an apo&s;tle, <HI>&s;eperated</HI> to the go&s;pel of God.</Q> He here evidently de|&s;igns to give him&s;elf, his true and proper character, of an apo&s;tle, and mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He therefore parti|cularly mentions, both his <HI>call</HI> to the apo&s;tle&s;hip, and his <HI>&s;eperation</HI> to the go&s;pel mini&s;try. By the former, he mo&s;t likely means, that immediate call from heaven, of which in Acts ix. Then it was he was <HI>called to be an apo&s;tle.</HI> But we find nothing in &s;cripture an&s;wering to this other part of his character, viz. his <HI>&s;eperation to the go&s;pel of God,</HI> unle&s;s it was this <HI>&s;eperation</HI> we are now con&s;idering. And it is worthy of remark, the word in both places is the &s;ame, both in the original, and al&s;o in our tran&s;lation. In Acts 13th, <Q>The holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, APHORISATE, <HI>&s;eperate me Barnabas &amp; Saul to the work whereunto I have called them.</HI></Q> In Rom. 1.1. The apo&s;tle &s;ays he <Q>was, APHORISMENOS, <HI>&s;eperate to the go&s;pel of God.</HI></Q> Does it not appear highly probable, that when the apo&s;tle wrote the&s;e la&s;t mentioned words, he had his mind particularly upon the action we are con&s;idering? I confe&s;s I &s;ee no other &s;en&s;e in which they can be well interpreted. And if &s;o, we have the te&s;ti|mony, even of the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, that this was, in fact an ordination.</P>
<P>TO this Mr. L. objects, <Q>that if the&s;e prophets &amp; teach|ers were pre&s;byters, &s;o were Barnabas and Saul. And if this was an ordination, they, who were before pre&s;|byters, were ordained to a &s;uperior office; which, he &s;ays, is granting the thing they contend for.</Q> I in office, as apo&s;tles; yet there is no account, that either they, or indeed any others, had been formally intro|duced into office, as &s;tanding mini&s;ters in the church, by the impo&s;ition of hands, till now. They, and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, had hitherto, exerci&s;ed their mini|&s;try, principally among the Jews. But now, that the go&s;|pel was to be &s;ent to the Gentiles, and churches gathered and &s;ettled among them, upon a plan which was to be per|petuated,
<PB N="43" REF="010800_0022_0F81D1B81C868550">after the times of in&s;piration were over, even to the end of the world; it &s;eemed good to the holy Gho&s;t, to order, that they &s;hould be &s;et apart, by the &s;olemn rite of ordination, as a &s;tanding pattern for the&s;e future ages. This, as Dr. Chauncy ob&s;erved, was the opinion of a learn|ed epi&s;copal writer, Dr. Lightfoot. <Q>No better rea&s;on, &s;ays he, can be given of this pre&s;ent action; than that the Lord did hereby, &s;et down a platform of ordaining mini&s;ters, to the church of the Gentiles in former times.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 189.</NOTE> This being the ca&s;e, it will by no means follow, that, <Q>if this was an ordination, they were ordained to a &s;uperior office,</Q> as he &s;uppo&s;es. Tho' they were in office before, they had been only "called to be <HI>apo&s;tles;</HI>" whereas now, they were "<HI>&s;eperated</HI> to the go&s;pel of God," by ordination, that &s;o they might, both have a public authentic character, and exhibit a pattern to be followed, in all &s;ucceeding ages. Had Mr. L.'s head been le&s;s crowded, with the un&s;criptural ideas of <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> and inferiority of orders in the mini&s;try, he might have recollected, that even <HI>reordination</HI> it&s;elf, does not nece&s;&s;arily <Q>advance a man to a &s;uperior office in the church.</Q> He doubtle&s;s knows &s;undry of his brethren in America, who have been twice ordained: Once, <Q>by the hands of the pre&s;bytery,</Q> according to &s;cripture pattern, and then again by the bi&s;hop, after they conformed to his church: And yet I &s;uppo&s;e, he acknowledges them &s;till, as &s;u&s;taining no higher office, than that of pre&s;byters. Tho' according to his argument, he ought, in all rea&s;on, to look upon them as dignitaries in the church; <Q>for who, (to u&s;e his own words) ever heard, that a pre&s;byter was ordained, unle&s;s it was, to advance him to a higher &s;tation in the church?</Q></P>
<P>BUT, <Q>In truth, &s;ays he, this was not an ordination; but an action of the &s;ame nature with that Gal ii. 9. When James, Cephas and John,</Q> &amp;c. It is well &s;ince he will not allow this to be an ordination, he has at la&s;t found what it is. It &s;eems then, that it was <Q>giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip:</Q> For that is what was done in the in&s;tance to which he compares it. Now giving the right hand of
<PB N="44" REF="010800_0023_0F81D1B8B6BB2F48">fellow&s;hip, as it is a public declaration and &s;ign, that the per&s;on to whom it is given, is now received into a copart|ner&s;hip of power and office with the givers, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;uppo&s;e that the per&s;ons giving, are at lea&s;t, equal in power with him who receives it. Con&s;equently if what was now done, was, as he &s;ays, giving the right hand of fellow|&s;hip to Barnabas and Saul, it will follow that the&s;e prophets and teachers were at lea&s;t equal in power to Barnabas and Saul. Since therefore Mr. L. allows the ordaining power to the latter, it mu&s;t equally belong to the former, whether they did in fact exerci&s;e it at this time or no; and then the validity of ordination by pre&s;byters will of cour&s;e follow.</P>
<P>AGAIN. If the&s;e two actions are, as he &s;ays, both of the &s;ame nature, then it will follow, that the per&s;ons acting in both were of the &s;ame office, or indu'd with equal power: But tho&s;e who gave the right hand, in Gal. ii. 9. viz. James, Cephas and John, were undoubtedly ve&s;ted with the ordain|ing power, for they were apo&s;tles: Con&s;equently the pro|phets and teachers, who acted in the other in&s;tance, mu&s;t be ve&s;ted with the &s;ame power of ordination too, whether they actually exerci&s;ed it at this time or not.</P>
<P>MR. L. has one objection more to this in&s;tance of ordi|nation. It is this, <Q>Whatever is meant by this de&s;ignati|on, it was not ordination to impower Paul, for&mdash;it is beyond all di&s;pute that Paul and Barnabas officiated as public mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, long before this pretended or|dination.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 11, 12.</NOTE> An&s;wer; if they did, it was as apo&s;tles, by virtue of their extraordinary call; not as ordinary mini|&s;ters, in the gentile church, of &s;tanding continuance, by the impo&s;ition of hands in ordination. Tho' therefore with re|&s;pect to the former, <Q>they were, as he &s;ays, <HI>apo&s;tles, not of men, neither by man;</HI></Q> yet in the latter &s;en&s;e, they received their de&s;ignation from men, as others now do, by the im|po&s;ition of hands in a proper ordination. Their <Q>officia|ting as public mini&s;ters before,</Q> by virtue of their extra|ordinary call, no more proves that this was not an ordina|tion; than the eleven apo&s;tles &s;o officiating, by virtue of a temporary mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t in his life time, will prove
<PB N="45" REF="010800_0023_0F81D1B8B6BB2F48">the commi&s;&s;ion, he gave them after his re&s;urrection, was no commi&s;&s;ion. Mr. L. allows that the commi&s;&s;ion recorded in Mat. 28.19. and John 20.21. was that which authorized the apo&s;tles to act as mini&s;ters. And yet we know that Chri&s;t ordained the twelve apo&s;tles, and &s;ent them forth to preach, long before he gave them this commi&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. Mark iii. 14.</NOTE> If therefore the eleven apo&s;tles &s;o officiating in Chri&s;t's life time, does not prove the commi&s;&s;ion he gave them after his re&s;urrection, to be no commi&s;&s;ion; neither will Barnabas &amp; Saul's &s;o officiating before this, prove that this was no or|dination.</P>
<P>THIS objection indeed the Dr. largely con&s;idered and an|&s;wered in his &s;ermon. He there ob&s;erved, that tho' <Q>Paul and Barnabas were before this, commi&s;&s;ioned mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t;</Q> yet this would by no means prove that they did not now receive a proper ordination. <Q>For the thing in|tended by ordination, is not that the ordainers &s;hould commi&s;&s;ion per&s;ons to do the work of the mini&s;try. This is done by Chri&s;t. It only belongs to them to declare who the&s;e per&s;ons are, and to &s;eperate them to the work to which Chri&s;t has commi&s;&s;ioned them. They don't make them mini&s;ters, but being authorized hereto, give them an authentic character as &s;uch, in the eye of the world, &amp;c. "As in the ca&s;e of the mayor of a city, the king's charter of incorporation grants the power; the burge&s;&s;es and the recorder only indigitate the proper recipient of it, and put him legally into the execution of his office.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dud. loc. p. 10, 32, 33. The judicious Hooker, as he is called, fully agrees with Dr. Chauncy in his notion of ordination. He defines it, "a &s;olemn admittance;" and &s;ays, <Q>the only true and proper act of ordination is, <HI>to inve&s;t</HI> men with that power which doth make them mini&s;ters, by con&s;ecrating their per&s;ons to God and his &s;ervice in holy things.

<PB N="46" REF="010800_0024_0F81D1B970AA5020">but from tho&s;e that ordain them <Q>It is true, he &s;ays, that all power in the church of Chri&s;t is originally derived from him. When Chri&s;t was here upon earth, he re&s;erv|ed the power of <HI>making officers,</HI> in his kingdom, to him&s;elf alone: When he was about to a&s;cend to heaven, he told a number of his di&s;ciples, that all power, &amp;c.</Q> That is, if I under&s;tand him, tho' the great head of the church, while he was upon earth, kept the power of <HI>making officers</HI> in his own hand, yet when he a&s;cended into heaven he delegated this power to his apo&s;tles and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. 'Tis pity Mr. L. had not told us, how much of this power <HI>of making officers</HI> in the church, is now delegated to the bi&s;hops; whe|ther all, or only a part of it; or in what &s;en&s;e it is now in the hands of the bi&s;hops, whether <HI>de&s;potically</HI> or ab&s;olutely, or only <HI>mini&s;terially.</HI> If it be only in the latter &s;en&s;e in them, then they are only Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters or in&s;truments in introducing men into office, and inve&s;ting them with the powers of Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, as the Dr. a&s;&s;erted, and &s;o don't properly <HI>give</HI> the commi&s;&s;ion, but only <HI>indigitate</HI> or point out the recipient of it. All therefore they have to do in the ca&s;e, is only to judge of the qualifications of the per|&s;ons to be ordained, and give them a &s;olemn admi&s;&s;ion to the exerci&s;e of their office, by fa&s;ting, prayer and the impo|&s;ition of hands. The commi&s;&s;ion therefore is not from them, but from Chri&s;t. But if this power delegated to the bi&s;hops, be <HI>de&s;potical,</HI> as Mr. L. mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, or el&s;e what he here &s;ays is nothing to his purpo&s;e: If it be true, as he &s;eems to intimate, that bi&s;hops now, have the &s;ame power of <HI>making officers</HI> in the church, as Chri&s;t had when here upon earth; then it will follow, that no mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;ince Chri&s;t's a&s;cention into heaven, can be &s;aid to receive their commi&s;&s;ion or authority from him, but from the or|dainers: As therefore in the ca&s;e of a city-mayor; if, as our author a&s;&s;erts, he receives his commi&s;&s;ion, not from the king's charter, but from the recorder, and is therefore not the king's officer, but his who gave him his oath; &s;o in this ca&s;e, if mini&s;ters now, do not receive their commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, but from tho&s;e to whom he has delegated this
<PB N="47" REF="010800_0024_0F81D1B970AA5020">power of <HI>making officers</HI> in his church, that is, according to Mr. L. the bi&s;hops; then they are no longer Chri&s;t's mi|ni&s;ters, but the bi&s;hop's who gave them commi&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently they ought to preach, baptize, &amp;c. not in the name of Chri&s;t, but of the bi&s;hop, who&s;e mini&s;ters they are, and who gave them their authority.</P>
<P>FURTHER, as Chri&s;t <HI>had all power in heaven and earth,</HI> &amp; &s;o was under no limitation as to the exerci&s;e of this power in <HI>making officers</HI> in his church, but might, if he had &s;een fit, multiplied the&s;e officers, and, in&s;tead of two, appointed twenty, or two hundred different kinds or orders: So from this principle of Mr. L.'s, it will follow, that not only the apo&s;tles but their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office, to whom Chri&s;t has delegated this power of <HI>making officers,</HI> have the &s;ame unli|mited authority al&s;o, in this re&s;pect as he had: That they are not confined to any particular number of orders, in the exerci&s;e of this their <HI>office making</HI> power; but may appoint and e&s;tabli&s;h, as many different orders and degrees as they plea&s;e; and in&s;tead of three orders in the church, might have three hundred or three thou&s;and. For Chri&s;t had un|doubtedly this power. And indeed this is the &s;en&s;e of the romi&s;h church upon this point. The pope, in virtue of his being &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Peter, is, according to them, not only infallible, but is ve&s;ted with all the plentitude of the power that Chri&s;t had, in this re&s;pect. And it is by this plenti|tude of power, with which he is ve&s;ted, not only that he has con&s;tituted that great variety of orders, found among their clergy; but al&s;o rai&s;ed tho&s;e they call bi&s;hops, above pre&s;|byters in the church. According to the doctrine of that church, bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to pre&s;byters, not by <HI>divine right,</HI> but merely as advanced to this &s;uperior dignity by the plentitude of the pope's power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Burn.

<P>AS the Dr. no where &s;ays that men are inve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, before ordination, as the que&s;tion &s;eems to intimate; He ought rather to a&s;k, "how the ordainers are to know who are proper to be ordained, or ve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, and declared lawful mini&s;ters?&mdash;And here the an&s;wer is ea&s;y. They are to know it by the can|didate's profe&s;&s;ing an inclination to enter into the mini&s;try, his being upon examination, found qualified for it, and, (in ca&s;e he is to take the charge of a particular church) his being cho&s;en and invited by the church to take the pa&s;toral charge of them.

<P>THUS I have endeavoured particularly to an&s;wer every objection brought again&s;t this in&s;tance of Paul's &amp; Barnabas's &s;eperation, and, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently proved it to be a real &amp; proper ordination. That it was &s;o, was the declared opinion of Chry&s;o&s;tom, one of the fathers. He a&s;&s;erts that <Q>Paul was ordained at Antioch,</Q> and that this is the &s;en&s;e of Acts 13.1&mdash;3.*. Bi&s;hop Taylor was of the &s;ame &s;entiment, as I &s;hewed in my &s;ermon. The &s;ame was the opinion of Dr. Lightfoot and Dr. Hammond, two celebrated writers of the epi&s;copal &s;ide.* And Mr. Ollyffe another of them, in his di&s;pute with Mr. Calamy, brings this very text in fa|vour of reordination.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As quoted by Eu&s;ch, ine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">mat p. 43.</NOTE> Finally, <Q>in the book of ordina|tion u&s;ed in the church of England, (as my author &s;ays, for I have not the book by me) the order for con&s;ecrating bi&s;hops, alledges the very fact we have been con&s;idering, as an example or precedent.</Q>* This &s;hews that the church of England looks upon this as a proper ordination, however &s;ome of her zealous &s;ons, for &s;pecial rea&s;ons, are tempted to deny it. But let it be called by what name it will, it is indubitably an expre&s;s and very circum&s;tantial in&s;tance, of per&s;ons being &s;eperated, and &s;ent forth to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, which is all the &s;cripture means by ordina|tion. And as this was confe&s;&s;edly done, not by officers of
<PB N="50" REF="010800_0026_0F81D1BAECCD9EA8">a &s;uperior character, not by apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops, but by teach|ers or pre&s;byters, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a proper &s;cripture pattern of pre&s;byterian ordination, and a proof that &s;uch ordination is valid.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to con&s;ider what Mr. L. has to &s;ay, up|on the other in&s;tance of pre&s;byterian ordination in &s;cripture, as mentioned by the Dr. viz. that of Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 14. <Q>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the <HI>pre&s;bytery.</HI></Q> This, the Dr. mentioned, as an expre&s;s in|&s;tance of ordination by pre&s;byters, and very fully an&s;wered all the objections commonly urged again&s;t it by epi&s;copa|lians. Nor do I find any material one added by Mr. L. He indeed tells us <Q>the text &s;ays, Timothy was not ordain|ed by pre&s;byters, but by prophecy.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 19.</NOTE> I an&s;wer: It does not &s;ay in &s;o many words, he was <HI>ordained</HI> by either. The word, <HI>ordained,</HI> not being mentioned. But then, the thing &s;ignifying ordination; the rite univer&s;ally in u&s;e, in &s;etting men apart to the mini&s;try, viz. <HI>impo&s;ition of bands,</HI> is par|ticularly mentioned, and expres&s;ly &s;aid to be performed, not by an apo&s;tle, not by an officer of a &s;uperior character, nor yet by <HI>prophecy;</HI> but by the <HI>pre&s;bytery.</HI> His &s;aying therefore "that Timothy was ordained by <HI>prophecy,</HI>" a phra&s;e to which he, nor no man el&s;e can affix any determi|nate idea, could be with no other view, than to confu&s;e the minds of his readers, and perplex an argument, which he found him&s;elf unable fairly to an&s;wer. Had he attended to what the Dr. had ob&s;erved, concerning the gift, here &s;aid to be given to Timothy, by prophecy, it might have pre|vented his impo&s;ing upon his readers, and betraying his own ignorance in the interpretation he has given of this text. At the &s;ame time, it would have &s;aved him the trouble of repeating that other objection, &s;o particularly an&s;wered by the Dr. viz. that Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordina|tion. The word <HI>gift,</HI> here &s;aid <Q>to be given to Timothy by prophecy,</Q> &amp;c. Mr. L. in&s;i&s;ts, is the &s;ame in the ori|ginal with that mentioned II Tim. i. 6. as given by the put|ing on of Paul's hands. The Dr. allows it is. He more|over
<PB N="51" REF="010800_0026_0F81D1BAECCD9EA8">allows the &s;ame thing to be &s;ignified, in both texts, viz. the extraordinary gifts of the holy Gho&s;t. And fur|ther, that the&s;e were communicated to Timothy by Paul's hands only. For after mentioning the text in que&s;tion, he &s;ays, <Q>The meaning of the words, compared with what is &s;aid upon the matter in II Tim. i. 6. may be fully ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the following paraphra&s;e, "Improve the gift of the holy Gho&s;t, which I imparted to you, in an ex|traordinary mea&s;ure, according to the prophecies which went before concerning you, when you was &s;eperated to the work of the mini&s;try, with the laying on of the hands of the con&s;i&s;tory of pre&s;byters.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dad. lec p. 36.</NOTE> In this paraphra&s;e is fairly and methodically included, every thing contained in both texts, concerning Timothy's ordination, and the gift here &s;aid to be imparted to him. The <HI>gift,</HI> in both places, &s;ignifies, the extraordinary HARISMETA or gifts of the holy Gho&s;t. The&s;e, the Dr. allows were conferred by the impo&s;ition of Paul's hands only, as mentioned in II Tim. i. 6. This was given by <HI>prophecy;</HI> that is agreeable to, or in con&s;equence of the prophecies, which the apo&s;tle &s;ays I Tim. i. 18. went before concerning Timothy. Holy men prophetically &s;peaking by in&s;piration, of him, as a fit per|&s;on to receive this gift, and in con&s;equence, to be put into the mini&s;try; to which &s;ervice he is here, in I Tim. iv. 14. &s;aid to be &s;eperated, by the impo&s;ition of the hands of the pre&s;bytery, in ordination. This makes both the accounts, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, which no other interpretation, perhaps, can do. To be &s;ure that given by Mr. L. is very far from doing it. Indeed, as in the forementioned in&s;tance of Paul and Barnabas; &s;o al&s;o in this of Timothy, he &s;eems very loth to allow, that ordination is intended by the impo&s;ition of hands. "If, &s;ays he, this was an ordination." Again, "If this was an ordination, then," &amp;c. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, in both the&s;e in&s;tances, what were his rea&s;ons for expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf &s;o doubtfully in the ca&s;e. If the&s;e were allowed to be proper ordinations, he was fully &s;en&s;ible, all he could &s;ay, would be in&s;ufficient to weaken the force of the argu|ment, brought from them, in favour of pre&s;byterian ordi|nation
<PB N="52" REF="010800_0027_0F81D1BBE2F7A130">And therefore he endeavours to per&s;uade his read|ers, that it is, at lea&s;t doubtful, whether ordination is the thing intended. But as the evidence in the ca&s;e is &s;o full; as every thing included in ordination is more particularly and expres&s;ly mentioned, in the&s;e two in&s;tances, than in any others recorded in the new-te&s;tament; and I may add, as there can certainly be found no in&s;tance of an ordination in the whole bible, if the&s;e are not allowed to be &s;uch; Mr. L. &s;eems not quite willing, after all, to hazard the i&s;&s;ue of the controver&s;y, upon a bare denial of this fact: But thinks it concerns him to &s;hew, that if this was an ordination, yet it was not performed by pre&s;byters. And the only argument he brings for the purpo&s;e, is, "that the word <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> "here, does not &s;ignify a number of <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI> His words are; <Q>It &s;eems, the Dr. takes it for granted, that a pre&s;|bytery means a number of pre&s;byters only. Calling a number of pre&s;byters, a pre&s;bytery, does not prove that St. Paul means the &s;ame, when he u&s;ed the words.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 18.</NOTE> He therefore concludes that <Q>Paul was at the head of the&s;e el|ders to con&s;titute them a pre&s;bytery, with power to or|dain.</Q> If therefore I can prove, that the word PRESBU|TERION, a <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> always &s;ignifies, in the new-te&s;tament, and other ancient writers, <HI>a number of pre&s;byters only;</HI> then his whole objection again&s;t the Dr's interpretation of the&s;e words, is overthrown; and this in&s;tance of Timothy's or|dination, will remain an inconte&s;tible pattern and proof of pre&s;byterian ordination.</P>
<P>NOW the word PRESBUTERION is to be found but in two other places in all the new-te&s;tament, in both of which it &s;ignifies "a number of pre&s;byters only." The fir&s;t is Luk. xxii. 66. <Q>And when it was day PRESBUTERION, <HI>the elders</HI> of the people and the chief prie&s;ts and the &s;cribes came together,</Q> &amp;c. It is very evident the word here means a number of elders or presbyters only: It is &s;o tran&s;lated; the <HI>elders</HI> of the people, the &s;anhedrim or grand council of the Jews: Not including the chief prie&s;ts, the &s;cribes, or indeed any other officer of a &s;uperior rank, as Mr. L. would have it in the other in&s;tance: The&s;e are al&s;o expres&s;ly men|tioned,
<PB N="53" REF="010800_0027_0F81D1BBE2F7A130">and very particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the account; the <HI>elders</HI> of the people, PRESBUTERION, and the chief prie&s;ts and the &s;cribes. Be&s;ides, the very per&s;ons who are here called by the collective name, PRESBUTERION; in the parallel place, Matt. xxvii. 1. are called by the common or appropriate one, PRESBUTEROUS, (which &s;hews the words are u&s;ed &s;ynonimou&s;ly) and they are there al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from the chief prie&s;ts or any other officers. It is therefore beyond all di&s;pute that the word <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> here means a number of elders only.</P>
<P>The other place, in which the word occurs, is Acts xxii. 5. There it is tran&s;lated, "the &s;tate of the elders," that is, the body or company of presbyters. Here again they are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the chief prie&s;t, or any other &s;uperior officer; for he is particularly mentioned, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the TO PRESBUTERION, the &s;tate or body of elders.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it may be noted, that the presbytery or elders among the Jews, called PRESBUTERION or SANHEDRION, was their <HI>&s;upreme</HI> court of judicature.

The right of government was ve&s;ted in them, and they were all ve&s;ted with equal power. <Q>They were, as a learned writer tells us, originally intru&s;ted with the power of <HI>ordaining</HI> elders to &s;upply the vacancies made in their own body.

Not as Mr. L. would have it, <Q>a number of elders with an apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop at their head.</Q> Thus it &s;ignifies in &s;cripture, and in all good au|thors where it occurs. Nor do I remember ever to have &s;een it u&s;ed, in any other &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>DR. CHAUNCY had therefore good right <Q>to take it for granted, that a presbytery means, a number of presbyters only.</Q> And &s;ince this is the word u&s;ed in this in&s;tance, it is a clear con&s;equence, that Timothy was ordained by a number of <HI>pre&s;byters;</HI> and therefore that presbyterian ordi|nation, is the true &s;cripture ordination.</P>
<P>NOR will it at all alter the ca&s;e tho' we &s;hould grant that Paul joined with the presbytery in Timothy's ordination: For if he did, he acted, not as an apo&s;tle, but as a presby|ter, of no more authority than the re&s;t. For it is in this character only, that the per&s;ons who impo&s;ed hands are here &s;aid to act: Plainly denoting that they acted as a <HI>pre&s;|bytery;</HI> and con&s;equently, that the right of ordination is ve&s;ted in &s;uch a body, and in none el&s;e.</P>
<P>HENCE it will follow, that what Mr. L. &s;ays about the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly in Connecticut,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 18, 19.</NOTE> is not true. It is not true <Q>that a number of presbyters have no more power to ordain without a bi&s;hop, than the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly have, to perform acts of legi&s;lation without the governor.</Q> So far from it, that <HI>presbyters</HI> and they only are ve&s;ted with the power of ordination; and even when an apo&s;tle was joined with them, if that indeed was the ca&s;e; he acted, not as an <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> but as a <HI>pre&s;byter;</HI> therefore the action is expres&s;ly &s;aid to be done by a con&s;i&s;|tory of presbyters, as we have &s;hewed above. But if it were not &s;o: If it were true, as he &s;ays, that a number of pre&s;|byters have ju&s;t as much and no more authority, with or without a bi&s;hop, than the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly have, with or without the governor; &s;till it will be nothing at all
<PB N="55" REF="010800_0028_0F81D1BC909F2C38">to his purpo&s;e. For as the lower hou&s;e, can perform no act of legi&s;lation, without the governor; no more can the governor without them. The power of the latter, in this ca&s;e therefore, is at lea&s;t equal to the former. If then we allow this a parallel ca&s;e, it will indeed follow that pre&s;|byters have no power to ordain, without a bi&s;hop: But it will equally follow, that the bi&s;hop has no &s;uch power with|out the presbyters. Con&s;equently their power in this re|&s;pect is equal. But, unluckily for our author, this will at once ruin his &s;cheme, agreeable to which the <HI>&s;ole</HI> power of ordination is in the bi&s;hop, and the presbyters have no manner of authority in the ca&s;e. Thus have I very par|ticularly, and I think &s;ufficiently vindicated the Dr's inter|pretation of this text, and proved it to be a &s;tanding pat|tern and warrant for presbyterian ordination.</P>
<P>MR. L. goes on,&mdash; <Q>Another objection is, that in &s;crip|ture, bi&s;hops are frequently called presbyters; therefore bi&s;hop and presbyter mean one and the &s;ome office. In an&s;wer to this I would a&s;k, whether apo&s;tle and presbyter mean one and the &s;ame office in &s;cripture? An&s;wer this without a double meaning, and the point is &s;ettled.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 18, 19.</NOTE> &mdash;I an&s;wer. Con&s;idered as &s;tanding officers in the church, they mo&s;t certainly do; and the apo&s;tle Peter him&s;elf &s;hall be my voucher. <Q>The <HI>elders,</HI> &s;ays he, which are among you I exhort, who am al&s;o an <HI>elder.</HI>" <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">II Pet. v. 1.</NOTE> This then, accor|ding to him, mu&s;t &s;ettle the point.</Q></P>
<P>AS another proof of ordination by presbyters, the Dr. ob&s;erved, <Q>that be&s;ides deacons, the &s;cripture mentions but one order of officers only, promi&s;cuou&s;ly called bi&s;hops or presbyters, therefore that the ordaining power mu&s;t belong to that order.</Q> In proof of this he added &s;undry texts, and among others Philip. 1.1. where the apo&s;tle, ad|dre&s;&s;ing this church with its officers, makes mention of but two orders, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>deacons.</HI></P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this Mr. L. &s;ays, the&s;e bi&s;hops were the presbyters of this church; and that, be&s;ides them and the deacons, there was an apo&s;tle, viz. Epaphroditus, pre&s;iding over them in quality of <HI>bi&s;hop.</HI> In proof of this he quotes
<PB N="56" REF="010800_0029_0F81D1BD371A2BB0">chap. ii. v. 25. where Paul &s;ays, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;ed it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end to you, Epaphroditus my brother, &amp;c.&mdash;but your <HI>me&s;&s;enger.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 19. 20</NOTE> "In the original, he tells us, it is <HI>your apo&s;tle.</HI> Hence he infers, that in this church, were three orders of mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>ANSWER. Epaphroditus being <HI>&s;ent</HI> to Philippi is no proof he was &s;ent there in character of a bi&s;hop. If &s;o then Timothy mu&s;t have been their bi&s;hop al&s;o. For Paul &s;ays, "I tru&s;t in the lord to <HI>&s;end</HI> Timothy unto you &s;hortly." v. 24. But this would be, to have two bi&s;hops in this one church, which is utterly incon&s;ident with the epi&s;copal &s;cheme; according to which there can be but one bi&s;hop to one church. Neither will his being called the Philippi|an's <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> prove that he was their <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> or held any office in this church. I grant the word in the original is APOSTOLON, an apo&s;tle. This, however, in its common &amp; unappropriated &s;en&s;e, means not a bi&s;hop, or indeed any church officer; but according to its original derivation, a <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> or one &s;ent. It is accordingly &s;o tran&s;lated, wherever it occurs in &s;cripture, in its unappropriated &s;en&s;e, ju&s;t as it is in this place. We meet with it in John xiii. 16. and II Cor. viii. 23. But as it is u&s;ed in its unappropriated &s;en&s;e in both, &s;o it is tran&s;lated, as here, not <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> but <HI>me&s;|&s;enger:</HI> But if it mu&s;t be rendered <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> in this place, as Mr. L. contends, it mu&s;t al&s;o in the others, and wherever it occurs. And if this be the ca&s;e, John the bapti&s;t, and tho&s;e who were &s;ent to him from the phari&s;ees, mu&s;t be al|&s;o acknowledged as apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops: For they are called APOSTELLMENOI, apo&s;tles, a word of the &s;ame theme and import with this. And therefore if this word mu&s;t always &s;ignify <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> or bi&s;hop, po&s;&s;ibly Mr. L. will find in &s;crip|ture, an in&s;tance of a <HI>&s;he-bi&s;hop</HI> or apo&s;tle: For Junia, which by many is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the name of a woman,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;o&s;tom, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Origen, Hil|lary the deacon, Pelagius, Prima&s;ius, Bede, Haimo, and Premigius, read, not Junia, but Julia, believing her to be a woman, as the learned Blou|del a&s;&s;ures us</NOTE> is &s;aid with Andronicus, "to be chief among the <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom xvi. 7.</NOTE> But "the truth of the ca&s;e is: The word APOSTOLON is here
<PB N="57" REF="010800_0029_0F81D1BD371A2BB0">u&s;ed in its unappropriated &s;en&s;e. Our engli&s;h bibles there|fore rightly have it tran&s;lated, not apo&s;tle, but <HI>me&s;&s;enger</HI> or one &s;ent. For &s;o Epaphroditus was. He had been <HI>&s;ent</HI> by the Philippians to carry their bounty to Paul, as appears from chap. iv. 18. And therefore the apo&s;tle very properly calls him <HI>their me&s;&s;enger.</HI> Again. Paul's calling Epaphro|ditus, <HI>your me&s;&s;enger,</HI> plainly &s;hews that he was not an apo&s;|tle in the appropriate &s;en&s;e of the word. The apo&s;tles, as &s;uch, are never called apo&s;tles <HI>of the churches,</HI> but of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e apo&s;tles or me&s;&s;engers, they are, who gives them commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ends them forth. Thus Peter and Paul, often call them&s;elves apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I Pet i. 1. 1 Cor. i. 1. &amp;c.</NOTE> but they are never once called, <HI>your apo&s;tles,</HI> or the me&s;&s;engers of the church. Epaphroditus however is called a me&s;&s;enger or apo&s;tle, not of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but of the church: This plainly &s;hews that he was not an officer in that church, but only a <HI>me&s;&s;enger</HI> they had &s;ent, to carry money to Paul. In|deed it looks at lea&s;t highly improbable, had he been their <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> as Mr. L. pretends, that he &s;hould be &s;ingled out by them for &s;o inferior a piece of &s;ervice, as carrying their alms to Paul; e&s;pecially, as they had a num|ber of pre&s;byters and deacons, whom they might have im|proved in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>FINALLY, had Epaphroditus been the bi&s;hop of this church, is it not &s;trange the apo&s;tle &s;hould not mention him in his in&s;cription of his epi&s;tle to this church? He parti|cularly mentions the <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> or pre&s;byters, and deacons, but &s;ays not a word of any apo&s;tle. This neglect, mo&s;t certain|ly, Paul would not have been guilty of, had Epaphroditus been their bi&s;hop, as our author pretends. Upon the whole, the&s;e rea&s;ons mu&s;t, I imagine, convince every impartial per&s;on, that he was not the bi&s;hop of Philippi, that there were but only the two orders of bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, and deacons in this church, as the Dr. a&s;&s;erted, and therefore his argument for pre&s;byterian ordination, from this text, &s;tands good.</P>
<P>MR. L's next in&s;tance of three orders, is the church at <Q>Jeru&s;alem. We have clear evidence, he tells us, from
<PB N="58" REF="010800_0030_0F81D1BE46A99CB8">&s;cripture that, St. James re&s;ided for twenty years toge|ther, with and over the pre&s;byters and deacons there.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 20. 21.</NOTE> For proof of this he refers to Acts, chapters vi. and xv. chap. xxi. 18. and Gal. i. 19.</P>
<P>TWO things, he &s;ays, he has proved from the&s;e texts. One, that the apo&s;tle James re&s;ided for twenty years to|gether in the church at Jeru&s;alem: The other, that he re|&s;ided with and <HI>over</HI> the pre&s;byters and deacons of this church, during that time.&mdash;Let us examine his proofs.&mdash;</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t, it does indeed appear from the&s;e texts, that Paul found James at Jeru&s;alem, three &s;everal times, and at the di&s;tance of &s;undry years one from another. But then, at two of the&s;e times, the &s;ame accounts &s;ay, Peter was there with him. And one of them mentions John as there al&s;o. If, then from the&s;e two accounts it can be proved, that James was at Jeru&s;alem as bi&s;hop, during the term afore&s;aid; the &s;ame mu&s;t follow al&s;o as to Peter. This argument therefore either proves that both of them &s;o re&s;ided, or that neither did. But as they could not, in Mr. L's &s;en&s;e, be both bi&s;hops of this church, the con&s;e|quence is plain, that nothing can be concluded from the&s;e two accounts, that either of them were. All the proof then that remains as to this fact, is the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of his being found there by Paul, &s;ome years after. Acts xxi. 18. But as there is no account how long he re&s;ided there, barely his being found there, I pre&s;ume, will hardly be ad|mitted a &s;ufficient proof of Mr. L's a&s;&s;ertion, that the time of his continuance was twenty years. Indeed, as James, by our author's conce&s;&s;ion was an apo&s;tle, there is not the lea&s;t degree of probability, much le&s;s any proof, that he re&s;ided at Jeru&s;alem, or any other place, for any con&s;iderable time together, as his particular charge. So to do would have been utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the apo&s;tolic character, and the charge given to the apo&s;tles by Chri&s;t, <Q><HI>go teach all nations," "go into all the world,</HI> and preach the go&s;pel to <HI>every creature,"</HI> and &s;o preach repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins <HI>among all nations,</HI> beginning at Jeru&s;alem.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 19.

<PB N="59" REF="010800_0030_0F81D1BE46A99CB8">with any of the apo&s;tles making Jeru&s;alem their &s;tated re&s;i|dence, e&s;pecially for twenty years together, as Mr. L. a&s;|&s;erts, for my part I am unable to under&s;tand. Wherefore without offering a word more upon this point, I freely &s;ub|mit it to the candid reader to determine, whether the evi|dence Mr. L. has brought, to prove that James actually "re&s;ided twenty years together at Jeru&s;alem, is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the fact. But if it &s;hould be deemed to be, it will by no means follow, that he &s;o re&s;ided in character of a bi&s;hop, or as Mr. L. expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>with and over the pre&s;|byters and deacons there.</Q> This is the other thing he has here a&s;&s;erted, and for proof of it, he refers us to what he calls <Q>James's conduct in the ca&s;e St. Paul laid before him, Acts xv.</Q> I de&s;ire the reader to turn to the place, and read the whole account, and then &s;ay, what there is in it to prove that James, any more than any of the re&s;t, that were pre&s;ent at that council, was the bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem? Is it that he was at Jeru&s;alem at that time? So was Peter and John, and other apo&s;tles. They therefore from this circum&s;tance bid as fair for the office as he. Was it that James attended upon the council there? The &s;ame did the other apo&s;tles, yea and the elders and brethren too. Or was it that James gave his judgment, in the determination of the que&s;tion before them? This did all that were pre&s;ent. And therefore when the decree was drawn up and publi&s;h|ed, it is expres&s;ly &s;aid to go forth in the name <Q>of the apo&s;|tles, and elders and brethren.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v. 23</NOTE> Or la&s;tly as it that James in particular, &s;poke in the council, and declared his &s;entiments concerning the ca&s;e in que&s;tion? But the &s;ame did al&s;o &s;undry of the re&s;t, as Peter, Barnabas and Paul. The&s;e are all particularly mentioned as &s;peaking and de|claring their opinion upon the point in debate. Yea, as giving the &s;ame <HI>&s;entence</HI> or judgment, that James afterwards declared to be his. What right, I demand, then had Mr. L. to &s;ay, "that James's authority was <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> in the ca&s;e," any more than that of Peter, Paul and Barnabas, who had given the &s;ame &s;entence before? Certainly none. Nothing
<PB N="60" REF="010800_0031_0F81D1BEC20D6018">therefore appears from this circum&s;tance, or indeed from any thing el&s;e, in the account, in favour of James's epi&s;co|pal relation to, and authority over this church, and its offi|cers, but what equally appears in favour of the re&s;t. And &s;ince they could not all be bi&s;hops of it, it is a plain ca&s;e that none of them are proved to be &s;o; con&s;equently, that there were not three orders of officers in this church as Mr. L. has a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>HIS next attack upon the Dr. is for a&s;&s;erting, <Q>That the apo&s;tles as &s;uch, were extraordinary officers, and had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</Q> and then a&s;ks "in what re&s;pects they were &s;o.?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p 21.</NOTE> I an&s;wer.&mdash;Let him turn to the page in the Dr's &s;ermon, from whence he has quoted the&s;e words, and he will readily &s;ee. <Q>They received their commi&s;&s;ion immediately from Chri&s;t.

To Dr. Barrow as quoted by him, p. 272, &amp;c. and "the &s;cripture-bi&s;hop, p. 26, &amp;c. In the mean time, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, more particularly to con&s;ider this point, when I come to his remarks upon my &s;ermon, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here,&mdash;that Mr. L. does not pretend to prove bi&s;hops now-a-days, are indued with the&s;e extraordinary qualifications, on which the <HI>apo&s;to|lic</HI> character and powers were founded: con&s;equently the former cannot &s;ucceed the latter in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers.

If they were not <HI>peculiar</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="010800_0031_0F81D1BEC20D6018">to the apo&s;tles, they were at lea&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the apo&s;tolic character and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h men for the duties of it. Tho' therefore &s;ome, cotemporary with the apo&s;tles, might have &s;ome of the&s;e extraordinary qualifi|cations, e&s;&s;ential to the apo&s;tolic office; yet as none can pretend to them now; the con&s;equence is undeniable, that none now can pretend to &s;ucceed the apo&s;tles, in that part of their character and office, to which the&s;e extraordinary qualifications were e&s;&s;ential and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Since therefore dioce&s;an bi&s;hops do not, cannot &s;ucceed the apo&s;|tles, in that part of their character or office which was <HI>ex|traordinary,</HI> and peculiar to them; it belongs to him, if he would &s;upport his &s;cheme, to prove, that the apo&s;tles, in communicating their <HI>ordinary</HI> powers, did in fact make a difference; committing a <HI>chief</HI> power to a &s;uperior order, called <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> and an <HI>inferior</HI> one to others, under the name of <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is what he next attempts to do.&mdash; <Q>What we a&s;|&s;ert, &s;ays he, is that the apo&s;tles did commit a chief pow|er to a &s;uperior order, then called <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI></Q> And for proof he refers us to Acts xiv. 14. Philip. ii. 25. II Cor. viii. 23. <Q>From the&s;e texts, he tells us, it appears, that Barnabas, Epaphroditus and Titus are <HI>&s;tiled apo&s;tles."</HI> and adds, that he intends to prove Timothy al&s;o, to have been in|ve&s;ted with the &s;ame apo&s;tolic power and office.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. As to, at lea&s;t three of the four here mention|ed, neither the texts he has quoted, nor indeed any other in &s;cripture, proves them to be apo&s;tles, in the <HI>appropriate</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word. As to Epaphroditus, it has been already proved that he was no apo&s;tle, but only a me&s;&s;enger of the church of Philippi, &s;ent to carry their contribution to the apo&s;tle Paul; an errand not over and above apo&s;tolical.&mdash; As to Titus, he is no where, in &s;cripture, called an apo&s;tle in any &s;en&s;e whatever. The text Mr. L. quotes to prove him &s;o, is this, <Q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-helper concerning you: Or our brethren be enquired of, <HI>they</HI> are the <HI>me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the churches and the glory of Chri&s;t.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">II Cor. viii. 23.</NOTE> It &s;eems Mr. L.
<PB N="62" REF="010800_0032_0F81D1BF7643C4F8">thouught Titus mu&s;t needs be an apo&s;tle; becau&s;e he found the word, A POSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> in the &s;ame ver&s;e, in which Titus is named. But unhappily for him, it is not Titus, but the <HI>brethren</HI> that went with him, who are called A POS|TOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers.</HI> Titus is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from them in the former part of the ver&s;e, as Paul's partner &amp; fellow-labourer, and not of the number of the brethren who are called A POSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> in the latter part of it. But if he was not: If he was, as Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, of the number of the&s;e A POSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers;</HI> it would be no|thing to his purpo&s;e: For it is abundantly evident, from the context, that the word A POSTOLOI is here u&s;ed, not in its appropriate &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify an officer in the church; but in the common and unappropriated one, meaning bare|ly a <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> or one &s;ent. For it is evidently on account of their being <HI>&s;ent</HI> to Corinth to receive their collections, and carry them to Jeru&s;alem, and nothing el&s;e, that the&s;e per&s;ons are called A POSTOLOI, me&s;&s;engers of the churches. If therefore Epaphroditus was no <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> much le&s;s was Titus, who is never once called by that name, in any &s;en&s;e of the word what&s;oever. And tho' Mr. L. tells us <Q>he de&s;igned to prove Timothy to be one;</Q> yet as we find nothing of that kind done in the remaining part of his book; 'tis probable, upon &s;econd thought, he was di&s;|couraged in the attempt. Since therefore he has dropt him out of the number, we have a right to do the &s;ame, and &s;o there remains only Barnabas to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>AND, it is readily granted he is called an apo&s;tle in Acts xiv. 14. But until it is proved that he <HI>derived</HI> his apo&s;tolic power from the apo&s;tles; barely his being called an apo&s;|tle, will not prove his a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>that the apo&s;tles did com|municate a chief power to a &s;uperior order called apo&s;|tles." All that is proved from this text, is that "Barna|bas was an apo&s;tle.</Q> How he came to be &s;o, or from whom he <HI>received</HI> his "chief power" and &s;uperior character as an apo&s;tle, the text is intirely &s;ilent; nor can it be collected from any thing Mr. L. has &s;aid. If his being here menti|oned with Paul, &s;ignifies that he was ve&s;ted with the &s;ame
<PB N="63" REF="010800_0032_0F81D1BF7643C4F8">&s;uperior office and character as Paul was; no doubt he re|ceived his apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion and authority, in the &s;ame immediate way, and from the &s;ame fountain, as Paul did. How that was, he him&s;elf has told us. For he was <Q>an apo&s;tle, not of men, neither by man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and God the father</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 1.1.</NOTE> At lea&s;t till the contrary is proved from &s;cripture, we have a right to conclude this was the ca&s;e: Con&s;equently, that the apo&s;tles did not <Q>thus divide the ordinary powers of their office, communicating to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, and &s;o con&s;tituting the two orders of bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters,</Q> as our opponents pre|tend. I may therefore now with propriety, I pre&s;ume, take leave of this argument in the words of Dr. Chauncy. <Q>If the apo&s;tles did thus communicate the&s;e powers, in a different degree, committing to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, and &s;o con&s;tituting two orders in the mini&s;try; it is what we may rea&s;onably expect to &s;ee evidenced. The new-te&s;tament is open. If it contains any &s;uch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evi|dence to the contrary, and that we have given &s;uch evi|dence. Merely calling bi&s;hops &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles will not prove their &s;uperiority: Tho' by the way they are never called &s;o in the &s;acred books.&mdash;The bible only can &s;ettle this point.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dud. lec. p. 49, 50.</NOTE></P>
<P>OUR author proceeds.&mdash; <Q>Dr. Chauncy &s;eems to allow, that the church univer&s;ally has been governed, in the form of epi&s;copacy, (after the fir&s;t two centuries) for &s;everal &s;ucceeding ages. But, &s;ays he, <HI>before that,</HI> in the early days of the church, it was governed by pre&s;|byters.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 22.</NOTE> I have examined the pages, from whence he pretends to quote this pa&s;&s;age, but can find nothing of that kind there. If by <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> Mr. L. means <HI>dioce&s;an</HI> epi&s;co|pacy, (which he mu&s;t mean, or it is nothing to his purpo&s;e) the Doctor is &s;o far from allowing that the church was ever governed in that form, that on the contrary he affirms and proves, that during the fir&s;t century, and the greate&s;t part of the &s;econd, there is no di&s;tinction to be found, in the writers of tho&s;e times, between bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter; the

And even in the third cen|tury, and onwards, after the name bi&s;hop came to be ap|propriated, &s;o as to &s;ignify &s;omething different from pre&s;|byter; he expres&s;ly denies <Q>that the fathers are univer&s;al or unanimous, in affirming of it for fact, that it was a di&s;tinction importing a <HI>&s;uperiority of order,</HI> or that it was of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dud.

<P>I AM now prepared to con&s;ider his rhap&s;ody of que&s;tions quoted from Mr. Chillingworth, and tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;train added by him&s;elf in pages 22, and 23 of his book: The whole of which amount to no more than this, viz. how, when and by what means it was that the original form of pre&s;byterian church government, came to be changed to that of epi&s;copalian?</P>
<P>FOR an&s;wer to which, and indeed, to almo&s;t every thing el&s;e he has remarked upon the Dr's &s;ermon, I might very fairly refer him to the &s;ermon it&s;elf. At lea&s;t he will there &s;ee, that when this alteration of a di&s;tinction between bi|&s;hop and pre&s;byter fir&s;t began, it was very &s;mall. <Q>The bi&s;hop was no more than <HI>primus inter pares,</HI> the head pre&s;byter, the <HI>prae&s;es</HI> or moderator of the con&s;i&s;tory; and it was by gradual &s;teps he attained to the power with which he was afterwards ve&s;ted. The&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiorities and inferiorities, which have for a long time been vi&s;ible in the chri&s;tian world, were unknown in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t ages: Nor did they at once take place. It was the work of time. From prime-pre&s;byters, aro&s;e city-bi&s;hops: From city-bi&s;hops, dioce&s;an ones: From dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, metropolitans: From metropolitans, patriarchs; and finally, at the top of all, his holine&s;s the pope, claiming the character of univer&s;al head of the church.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dud. lec. p. 64.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF this an&s;wer will not &s;atisfy Mr. L. I will give him a|nother, in the words of a prote&s;tant in an&s;wer to a demand of the like kind from a papi&s;t. It is as follows. <Q>When

<P>BUT granting chri&s;tianity was as early planted in Great-Britain, as he pretends, this will by no means help him out with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion through the old briti&s;h bi&s;hops, as di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h church.

<P>IT is well known by all acquainted with the engli&s;h hi&s;|tory, that Au&s;tin the monk came into England toward the
<PB N="68" REF="010800_0035_0F81D1C404633AE0">latter end of the &s;ixth century. He was &s;ent there by Gre|gory, the pope of Rome, to convert the Anglo-&s;axons to chri&s;tianity. From that time to the reformation, A. D. 1530, a &s;pace of near a thou&s;and years, England was under the popi&s;h yoke, and over-run with all the errors and &s;u|per&s;titions of the church of Rome, as much as the re&s;t of Europe. The whole chri&s;tian world, for many hundred years before the reformation, "wandered after the bea&s;t;" and the church of England, during the whole of that peri|od, was as much the church of Rome, as that of France, Spain, or even Italy it&s;elf. All equally &s;unk in error, &s;u|per&s;tition, and idolatry, and equally <Q>drunk with the cup of abominations, and filthine&s;s of the fornications, of that old withered harlot.</Q> Where then, I a&s;k, will Mr. L. find a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for their clergy, except through the bi&s;hops of the romi&s;h church? His attempts to derive it thro' a line of "ancient briti&s;h bi&s;hops," is a mere chimera, that &s;carce de&s;erves notice. There were no &s;uch bi&s;hops to be found in England, during the greate&s;t part of that time. I readily allow that chri&s;tianity had been planted in Eng|land, before Au&s;tin's arrival; that upon the Saxon inva&s;i|on, a number of the briti&s;h chri&s;tians retired into the moun|tains of Wales, and pre&s;erved their liberty and chri&s;tianity. It is further granted, that upon Au&s;tin's coming into Eng|land, the old briti&s;h clergy in Wales, refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to &s;ub|mit to the pope's authority. In con&s;equence of which the greate&s;t part of them were cruelly put to the &s;word, in the city of Bangor, &s;aid to be effected by Au&s;tin's means.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Full ch II<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> 2. p. 63.</NOTE> The remainder were too incon&s;iderable a handful to make any oppo&s;ition to Au&s;tin, who was commi&s;&s;ioned by the roman pontif, and &s;upported by the power of the Saxon kings, &s;un|dry of whom are &s;aid to be his early converts. If the&s;e welch bi&s;hops therefore, were tho&s;e Mr. L. means by his "ancient briti&s;h bi&s;hops," from whom their clergy derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who he tells us <Q>as far as po&s;&s;ible, pre|vented all that came from Rome from getting into the vacant churches;</Q> the oppo&s;ition they made, could be but very feeble at be&s;t, and mu&s;t certainly have cea&s;ed, after

And as to the re|mainder of them we are a&s;&s;ured from hi&s;tory, that they &s;oon after &s;ubmitted to the church of Rome: <Q>For Lau|rentius, who &s;ucceeded Au&s;tin, as arch-bi&s;hop of Can|terbury, by demeaning him&s;elf more humbly, than his predece&s;&s;or had done, reduced the recu&s;ant Britons to &s;ome tolerable conformity to the romi&s;h ceremonies.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ful. ch.

What then can Mr. L. mean, by pretending to keep up a di&s;tinction between the briti&s;h clergy, and tho&s;e of the romi&s;h church? Wales, for many hundred years before the reformation, was as really under the "papal yoke" as he terms it, and received their bi&s;h|ops "from Rome" as much as any other part of the king|dom.</P>
<P>BUT if this had not been the ca&s;e: Had it been, as his argument &s;uppo&s;es, that there was a di&s;tinct &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops kept up in Wales, in a direct line from the anci|ent briti&s;h bi&s;hops, even till the reformation; this will afford him no manner of relief as to the pre&s;ent clergy of their church. They, certainly, can claim no benefit from &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of welch bi&s;hops; for not one of the welch bi&s;hops was concerned in the con&s;ecration of Parker, and yet from him all the bi&s;hops in the church of England ever &s;ince mu&s;t derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The fact was truly this. In the beginning of the reformation under Henry VIII. all the bi&s;hops, abbots and priors in England, (Fi&s;her

They were all, &s;ave one, deprived, and a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion begun in Parker, from whom all the bi&s;hops ever &s;ince, mu&s;t derive their claim.

But to the utter de&s;truction of his &s;cheme, &s;o it happened, that Parker, (from whom all the clergy of the church of England, both bi&s;hops and pre&s;by|ters, ever &s;ince, derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) was con&s;ecrated, not by any of the bi&s;hops of Wales, but by four engli&s;h bi&s;hops, who had been con&s;ecrated in king Edward's time, had been deprived in the reign of Q Mary, and had never been re|&s;tored. For the men who con&s;ecrtaed Parker, were Bar|low, formerly bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, Scory of Chiche&s;|ter, Coverdale of Exeter and Hodg&s;kins &s;uffragan of Bed|ford<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ful. ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.

Where then, I repeat it, will Mr. L. make out his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, thro' the line of the old briti&s;h bi&s;hops? If he was &s;o unac|quainted with hi&s;tory, as not to know that there was no manner of foundation for &s;uch a pretence, he was unqua|lified to write upon the &s;ubject, and ought not to have meddled with it.

<P>THE truth of the ca&s;e is, no hi&s;tory of the briti&s;h church furni&s;hes the lea&s;t foundation, even of pretence, for &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays, that the reformers in Eng|land, expre&s;sly allowed <Q>that England received the faith from tho&s;e &s;ent from Rome by pope Gregory the great, i. e. Au&s;tin and his monks.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridg. vol. 1. p. 103.</NOTE></Q> And all the advocates for uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, I have ever &s;een, till Mr. L's book appeared, unanimou&s;ly agree in tracing it up to Au&s;tin, and through him to St. Peter. Mr. Beach in particular, &s;ome years ago, in his controver&s;y with Mr. Hobart, &s;ays, <Q>the pre&s;ent archbi&s;hop of Canterbury is the &s;eventy third, who has &s;et in that &s;ee, &s;ince Au&s;tin the monk.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vind. p. 7.</NOTE> And tho' I don't imagine there is any great probability of an unbroken &s;ucce&s;ion, even in that line, yet it mu&s;t be &s;ought there, or no where. 'Till therefore Mr. L. brings us &s;ome better authority for one, through the old briti&s;h bi&s;hops, than his bare a&s;&s;ertion; he mu&s;t expect it will be treated with that contempt, &s;uch a vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;cheme de&s;erves.</P>
<P>I CALL this notion of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &amp; the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it to render go&s;pel admini&s;tration va|lid, a <HI>vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> &s;cheme.

But to be very confident of it, and that in a line where it is ab&s;olutely cer|tain it is not to be found, argues, if po&s;&s;ible, a greater de|gree
<PB N="72" REF="010800_0037_0F81D1C5801D7310">of weakne&s;s and credulity than what the mo&s;t vi&s;io|nary enthu&s;ia&s;ts are influenced by. And is not this even the ca&s;e with our author? For tho' he di&s;claims a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion through the romi&s;h church and lays the whole &s;tre&s;s upon one through the old briti&s;h bi&s;hops, which never had any exi&s;tence, &s;ave in a heated imagination, he is &s;o confi|dent of the truth of it, that he tell us, <Q>we have as good evidence that their clergy derive their authority, by an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the apo&s;tles, (meaning through the line afore&s;aid) as we have of the de&s;cent of all mankind from Adam by ordinary generation.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 26.</NOTE> The highe&s;t evidence to which, even Mr. Beach, pretended in this ca&s;e, and that in a line too, which bid much fairer, than the romantic one of our author, was only to put it upon a level, with that of the levitical prie&s;thood in the family of Aaron. This indeed was much too high. But even this it &s;eems will not content Mr. L. Nothing &s;hort of one, equal to that <Q>of our de&s;cent from Adam, will &s;erve his turn.</Q> If the faith of the advocates of this doctrine, con|tinues thus increa&s;ing, we may expect it will &s;oon grow up to full a&s;&s;urance; and that the next &s;tickler for uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will put the evidence of it upon a par with that of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>LET us however examine Mr. L's proof: And here let it be noted, that we have the mo&s;t clear and expre&s;s &s;crip|tural evidence of our natural de&s;cent from Adam, and there|fore are ab&s;olutely certain of it.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">&s;ee Gen. i. 17. &amp; ii. 22.

There is nothing in the commi&s;&s;ion, limiting the promi&s;e to &s;uch a &s;uperior order: Not the lea&s;t hint of the in&s;titution of &s;uch an order. The commi&s;&s;ion is but one, and therefore one order only is in&s;tituted by it. But if there were two, or ten, it would make no alteration: Since the promi&s;e is not limitted to any one in particular, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in either of them would an&s;wer all the ends of fulfilling the promi&s;e.

<P>THE truth is, as the commi&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es but one order in the mini&s;try, the utmo&s;t that can be argued from the annexed promi&s;e, in favour of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, even of any kind, is that there &s;hall be a <HI>mini&s;try</HI> continued in the church, to the end of time. How, or in what manner mi|ni&s;ter, &s;hall be introduced, whether in a regular unbroken line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or not, whether by a &s;uperior or inferior order of mini&s;ters, yea whether by the officers of the church or the brethren, as the commi&s;&s;ion is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilent upon this head, &s;o nothing relative thereto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> concluded from it.

It naturally tends to fill the minds of &s;erious chri&s;tians, with perplexing doubts and fears, as to the vali|dity and efficacy of the go&s;pel admini&s;trations, on which they attend; and utterly deprive them of the comfort and

How then could he pretend, <Q>that this was the <HI>&s;um</HI> of what I had advanced, in &s;upport of my principles?</Q> However, &s;ince he choo&s;es to combat only this one argument, I &s;hall follow him in his remarks upon it.&mdash;His words are, <Q>Mr. Welles &s;ays, p. 17, the&s;e la&s;t words (meaning the promi&s;e annexed to the com|mi&s;&s;ion) plainly &s;hew that this promi&s;e was made, not to the per&s;ons of the apo&s;tles but to their office as mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's church; and con&s;equently that their office is to&mdash;continue to the end of the world.&mdash;He a&s;&s;erts, p. 16, this is the commi&s;&s;ion, and the only commi&s;&s;ion we have any account of, which Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles.</Q>&mdash;The con&s;equence of which Mr. L. &s;ays, mu&s;t be this, <Q>that the commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituted them <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> and therefore the <HI>apo&s;tolic office</HI> mu&s;t continue to the end of time.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER.&mdash;If by <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> he means the office the apo&s;tles &s;u&s;tained, as ordinary mini&s;ters in the church; I readily grant that the commi&s;&s;ion in Mat. 28, did con|&s;titute them apo&s;tles, and that their office, in this &s;en&s;e of it, is to continue to the end of the world. But if by <HI>apo&s;|tolic office,</HI> he means their office as <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> properly &s;o call|ed, con&s;idered in their extraordinary character, I deny that it was to be continued, and affirm there is nothing in the words he pretends to quote from me, that will infer &s;uch a conclu&s;ion. 'Tis true I &s;aid, and &s;till &s;ay, <Q>that the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence to the end of the world, annexed to the commi&s;&s;ion, was made, not to the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the apo&s;tles, but to their <HI>office.</HI></Q> But as what?

<PB N="79" REF="010800_0040_0F81D1C7C6FD94D0">Chri&s;t's church,</Q> i. e. &s;tanding ordinary mini&s;ters.&mdash;I al&s;o &s;aid, <Q>that this is the commi&s;&s;ion, and the only one, we have any account of, that Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles.</Q> But then I added, "in virtue of which they were im|powered to act <HI>as mini&s;ters in his church.</HI>" i. e. as ordinary &s;tanding mini&s;ters, as the whole connexion of my di&s;|cour&s;e &s;hewed. Had Mr. L. thus quoted my words at large, every reader would have &s;een the weakne&s;s of the conclu&s;ion he pretends to draw from them. They are &s;o far from given any countenance to his notion of, "a con|tinuation of the <HI>apo&s;tolic office</HI> as &s;uch; that on the contra|ry, they very expre&s;sly di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>this,</HI> and their ordinary character, and very clearly &s;hew, that is was the latter, and not the former, that was to be perpetuated, and in which they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the end of time. This, I pre&s;ume, is &s;ufficient to vindicate my words from this con&s;equence he pretends to draw from them.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays Mr. L. <Q>the con&s;equence (meaning from my words) is plainly this: that the commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituted them apo&s;tles, or el&s;e that they acted as apo&s;tles with|out any commi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>I ANSWER, This is by no means a plain con&s;equence neither. Had I &s;aid, as he has imperfectly quoted me, <Q>that this is the only commi&s;&s;ion we have any account of, that Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles,</Q> and had added nothing further, it would indeed have followed, not as he &s;ays, "that they acted without any commi&s;&s;ion;" but that, for aught appeared in &s;cripture, they acted without any. The&s;e two conclu&s;ions are very different. The &s;cripture gives no account of the ordination of Silas, Apollos, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. I tru&s;t, however, he him&s;elf will not from hence con|clude that they acted as mini&s;ters without any commi&s;&s;ion or ordination. But then he well knew, that when I &s;aid, "this is the only commi&s;&s;ion," &amp;c. I meant the only one they received <HI>as &s;tanding go&s;pel mini&s;ters,</HI> inve&s;ted with an office to be perpetuated. This di&s;tinction was fully ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the clau&s;e he has &s;een fit to &s;uppre&s;s, viz. <Q>in virtue of which they were impowered to act as mini&s;ters,</Q> &amp;c. His conclu&s;ion therefore, <Q>that this commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="80" REF="010800_0041_0F81D1C89D152508">con&s;tituted them apo&s;tles, or el&s;e they acted without a commi&s;&s;ion,</Q> no ways follows. For altho' as <HI>&s;tanding ordinary mini&s;ters,</HI> they had no other commi&s;&s;ion, yet they might have <HI>as apo&s;tles.</HI> It was in the former view I &s;pake of them, not in the latter. Certainly they were called apo&s;tles long before this commi&s;&s;ion was given, even upon their being fir&s;t called by Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. 2.</NOTE> Paul was called and commi&s;&s;ioned to be an <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> and acted as &s;uch, long be|fore he received ordination as <HI>a &s;tanding go&s;pel mini&s;ter.</HI> The commi&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles as &s;uch, as extraordinary offi|cers, was in an extraordinary way; by an immediate call from heaven. As apo&s;tles, they were all with Paul "not of men, neither by men, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> i. i.</NOTE> When it was they received <HI>this</HI> commi&s;&s;ion, whether upon their fir&s;t call, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, or at the day of Penteco&s;t, as others think, is perhaps difficult certain|ly to determine. As their <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> properly &s;o call|ed, was extraordinary, and temporary, there was no occa|&s;ion the commi&s;&s;ion, impowering them thereto, &s;hould be particularly recorded in &s;cripture. This was given to them <HI>in per&s;on;</HI> and as they were to have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in it, none el&s;e had any concern with it. But as <HI>&s;tanding ordi|nary mini&s;ters,</HI> they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the end of time; and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary their commi&s;&s;ion, in this character, &s;hould be particularly recorded; for this concerned their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as well as them&s;elves. Accord|ingly we find, this commi&s;&s;ion is in fact recorded: 'Tis that we have been con&s;idering: 'Tis that to which the promi&s;e is annexed of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence to the end of the world; and the &s;ame concerning which I a&s;&s;erted in my &s;ermon, <Q>that it is the only one, we have any account of, which Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles, in virtue of which they were improved to act as <HI>ordinary</HI> mini&s;ters in his church.</Q> And for this purpo&s;e, no doubt it is recorded, that it might be a &s;tanding commi&s;&s;ion, impowering, au|thorizing and directing, all the true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to the end of the world.</P>
<P>OUR author's next remark is to this purpo&s;e,&mdash;that
<PB N="81" REF="010800_0041_0F81D1C89D152508">while I am proving from the one commi&s;&s;ion, that one or|der only of mini&s;ters can be virtuated by it, I my&s;elf, in effect, allow two, and &s;o defeat my own argument: For he &s;ays, I call the apo&s;tles in one place, <HI>extraordinary officers,</HI> and in another, <HI>ordinary ones,</HI> and yet the&s;e are both impow|ered by one commi&s;&s;ion; hence he concludes that I am "refuted by my&s;elf."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 28, 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>I ANSWER, had he hone&s;tly cited the pa&s;&s;age he pretended to quote from me, the weakne&s;s of this conclu&s;ion of his would have been obvious at fir&s;t view. 'Tis true I &s;peak of the apo&s;tles, as &s;u&s;taining the twofold character or office, of apo&s;tles, and ordinary go&s;pel mini&s;ters. But then it is e|qually true that I &s;peak only with re&s;pect to the <HI>latter,</HI> when I &s;ay, <Q>this is the commi&s;&s;ion and the only commi&s;&s;ion we have any account of their receiving from Chri&s;t.</Q> This di&s;tinction and limitation I fully enough expre&s;&s;ed, in the pa&s;|&s;age from which he quotes the&s;e words, tho' he has &s;een fit to &s;uppre&s;s it by apartial &amp; imperfect quotation. Such acts may help to &s;upport a bad cau&s;e: A good one has no need of them. Will it at all follow, that becau&s;e the apo&s;tles, con&s;idered as <HI>ordinary</HI> mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are impowered by this one ge|neral commi&s;&s;ion, that they mu&s;t as <HI>extraordinary</HI> officers al&s;o be impowered by the &s;ame? If it will not, then there is no force at all in Mr. L's conclu&s;ion from my argument, as tho' it allowed of two orders being impowered by one and the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion. As there is nothing expre&s;sly &s;aid, or e|ven implied in this commi&s;&s;ion, of more than one order to be impowered by it; not the lea&s;t intimation, that the pow|ers it contains are to be divided, and the whole given to one order, and part only to another; and finally, as it is incon|&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e, that two or more offices, the one &s;uperior, the other &s;ubordinate, &s;hould be virtuated and appointed by one and the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, we may I think, fairly con|clude, that one order of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, and only one, is appointed and impowered by this commi&s;&s;ion; con&s;equent|ly, that all the powers contained in this commi&s;&s;ion belong to that one order, and that of ordination among the re&s;t. I pre&s;ume therefore, my argument from the one commi&s;&s;i|on,
<PB N="82" REF="010800_0042_0F81D1C92C36CD48">&s;till &s;tands good, notwith&s;tanding all Mr. L. has &s;aid again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid in my &s;ermon, <Q>that the apo&s;tles in their ex|traordinary character, had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</Q> This Mr. L. calls "a bold a&s;&s;ertion," and demands <Q>what evidence I have produced to &s;upport it.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. As the a&s;&s;ertion is a negative, had no evidence been produced, it would hardly have de&s;erved the epithet of "bold." According to the rules of argumentation, the proof lies upon tho&s;e who affirm a fact, not upon tho&s;e who deny it. Had Mr. L. however, carefully read over the page in my &s;ermon, from whence he pretends to quote the pa&s;&s;age, he mu&s;t have &s;een the evidence he demands. My words are the&s;e, <Q>It mu&s;t be remembered that the apo&s;tles &s;u&s;tain|ed a twofold character, the one extraordinary as apo&s;tles, the other ordinary as go&s;pel mini&s;ters. In their extraor|dinary capacity, they were immediately called by Chri&s;t. &mdash;Were &s;ent forth by him to be witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrec|tion. &mdash;Were endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, the knowledge of tongues, the power of di&s;cerning &s;pirits, and of working miracles. They were not limitted to any particular place, one more than ano|ther, for the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try; but had the whole world a&s;&s;igned them as their charge; and being under the infallible guidance of divine in&s;piration, they had the &s;uperintendency and government of all the churches com|mitted to them, until the canon of &s;cripture &s;hould be full, and compleat rules given for that purpo&s;e in the word of God. In this they had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but this part of their office expired with them&s;elves: For as there is now no occa&s;ion for the&s;e extraordinary powers, &s;ince the &s;cripture is &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted, its canon compleated, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;titution and govern|ment of the church, particularly revealed; &s;o there are no men &s;ince the times of the apo&s;tles, who can lay any claim to the&s;e extraordinary and miraculous powers; and therefore none can pretend to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to them in that part of their <HI>character</HI> which was founded on the&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="010800_0042_0F81D1C92C36CD48">powers.</Q>&mdash;This was the &s;en&s;e in which I a&s;&s;erted <Q>the apo&s;tles had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</Q> and the&s;e the rea&s;ons I a&s;&s;ign|ed for &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion; and to me they appear conclu&s;ive: As this extraordinary character of the apo&s;tles had its ri&s;e in the extraordinary circum&s;tances, attending them, and was founded in the extraordinary powers be&s;towed upon them, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have cea&s;ed, if the circum&s;tances and powers have cea&s;ed, on which it was founded; but that the latter have cea&s;ed, Mr. L. will not deny: For whatever powers they claim for their bi&s;hops, the pretended &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors of the apo&s;tles; I think that of working miracles is not one of them. If he can produce any in&s;tance of that kind &s;ufficiently authenticated, they &s;hall be properly noticed; if not, he mu&s;t not be offended, if people look upon the claim a little a&s;&s;uming, nor pretend the <Q>a&s;&s;ertion is more bold</Q> than true, if the right to a&s;&s;ume the character &s;hould happen to be denied.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>that the apo&s;tles as &s;uch, have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which Mr. L. calls "an opinion which has nothing to &s;upport it but the prejudices of education</Q> is no way peculiar to pre&s;byterians. The learned Spanhemius, tho' a zealous prelati&s;t, in his di&s;pute with the pa|pi&s;ts again&s;t the pope's &s;upremacy as Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, maintains that the apo&s;tolic character is founded in an immediate call, the gi&s;t of tongues, and power of working miracles and is not perpetuated. <Q>Let the pope, &s;ays he, now de&s;cend from the capitol. Let him, as did the apo&s;tles, declare that he has the gift of tongues divinely infu&s;ed. Let him bring vi&s;ibly the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t from heaven. Let him work like the apo&s;tles, &s;uch illu&s;trious miracles, and then we &s;hall yield that he has <HI>apo&s;tolic authority.</HI>" He adds, "They are much deceived who would bring the apo&s;tles down to the order of particular bi&s;hops.&mdash; They were not at all called apo&s;tles, on the account that they were bi&s;hops, and con&s;equently, apo&s;tle and bi&s;hop are quite different things.</Q>

This he purpo&s;ely evades; and he had his rea&s;ons for it. If he had done this, he was &s;en&s;ible it would have at once appear|ed, that their office was not contained in, or virtuated by this commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o have overthrown his objection a|gain&s;t my argument, which was <Q>that one and the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, could con&s;titute but one office only.</Q> This <HI>&s;omething</HI> to which the&s;e deacons were ordained, was to <HI>&s;erve tables,</HI> concerning which work, not the lea&s;t hint is to be found in the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion. That indeed impow|ers tho&s;e to whom it is given, to <HI>preach, baptize,</HI> &amp;c. but &s;ays not a &s;ingle word of <HI>&s;erving tables</HI> and managing the church &s;tock, the peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s of deacons. As therefore the deacons office is not contained in, or virtuated by this commi&s;&s;ion; &s;o the appointment of them no ways militates again&s;t my argument, that where there is but one commi&s;&s;ion, there can be but one order or office impowered by it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' he cannot find the work of a deacon contained in the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;eems very de&s;irous of having their office virtuated by it, that &s;o he may make out
<PB N="85" REF="010800_0043_0F81D1CA215BB028">two orders impowered by the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, contrary to what I had a&s;&s;erted. <Q>If, &s;ays he, the commi&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles, impowered them to ordain but one order of of|ficers; how came they to con&s;titute the office of deacons.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 31.</NOTE> I an&s;wer:&mdash;They did it, not by virtue of the <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> commi&s;&s;ion we have been con&s;idering, but of that which con&s;tituted them <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI> The former, as has been &s;hewed, belonged to them, not as <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> but as ordinary mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, impowered thereby to <HI>preach, baptize,</HI> &amp;c. In vir|tue of this, they were no more impowered to con&s;titute a new order, than any of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;ame office. But as <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> as divinely in&s;pired, and under the infallible guidance of the Holy Gho&s;t, they had power to do it. And in this capacity, and this only, they acted, when they in&s;ti|tuted this office. As therefore, it was not in virtue of, or by power derived from the general mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, that this office of deacons was in&s;tituted; &s;o there can be no argument brought from their appointment, in proof of two or more offices virtuated by this commi&s;&s;ion; con&s;equently, my argument, <Q>that where there is but one commi&s;&s;ion, one order only can be virtuated or impowered by it,</Q> &s;till &s;tands good.</P>
<P>I readily allow <Q>the office of deacon, to be inferior to that of <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI></Q> I grant <Q>it is an office in which the pow|er of ordination is not included.</Q> And if it will plea&s;e him, I will concede too, that they may in a general &s;en&s;e, be called "mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's church." But then, as they are &s;o, not by virtue of the general commi&s;&s;ion given to mini&s;ters as <HI>mini&s;ters of the word and &s;acraments;</HI> but by the expre&s;s appointment of the apo&s;tles, acting in their <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> character; this will afford no argument in favour, either of his preaching deacons, or of his notion that two or more orders are impowered by this one commi&s;&s;ion. Let him &s;hew in this commi&s;&s;ion, or el&s;ewhere, as particular an ac|count of the appointment of their two orders of bi&s;hops &amp; pre&s;byters, as we can produce of the in&s;titution of deacons. Let him produce as expre&s;s warrant for deacons preaching, from the account of their fir&s;t in&s;titution, as we have for
<PB N="86" REF="010800_0044_0F81D1CAB2F378E8">that of pre&s;byters, in the general mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion; and we will readily allow their &s;cheme of dioce&s;an epi&s;copa|cy to be warranted by &s;cripture: 'Till then, he mu&s;t not be offended if people call it by its true and proper name, an un&s;criptural &s;cheme that has no countenance from the word of God.</P>
<P>BUT he tells me, that I undertook to prove the right of people to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ters, from the in&s;tance of deacons being cho&s;en by the church. <Q>Now, &s;ays he, if the&s;e deacons were mini&s;ters, it proves that there was more than one order of mini&s;ters at that time: If they were not, it does not prove the point for which he brought it.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 30.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. Deacons being called mini&s;ters in a general &s;en&s;e, agreeable to the original import of the word DIACO|NOS, will not prove them to be mini&s;ters in the &s;en&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ion, that is, <HI>mini&s;ters of the word and &s;acraments.</HI> If &s;o, Mr. L. mu&s;t admit a <HI>fourth</HI> order into their prie&s;thood, viz. that of &s;he mini&s;ters: For the apo&s;tle calls Phoebe a <HI>mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> (DIACONON) "of the church of Cenchrea."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 1.</NOTE> Con&s;e|quently, calling deacons <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> in this <HI>general &s;en&s;e,</HI> will not prove <Q>that there was more than one order of mini|&s;ters, <HI>in the proper &s;en&s;e,</HI> at that time.</Q> And yet their be|ing mini&s;ters in this general &s;en&s;e, that is, officers or &s;ervants of the church, and as &s;uch, cho&s;en and elected by the church, affords a good argument in proof of the church's right to choo&s;e her own officers in general, and con&s;equently tho&s;e who are to mini&s;ter in the word and &s;acraments in particu|lar. This in&s;tance therefore, of the deacons election by the church does as effectually <Q>prove the point for which I brought it,</Q> as if they had been mini&s;ters in the mo&s;t &s;trict and appropriate &s;en&s;e of the word. Thus my argu|ments for but one order of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;tand, I tru&s;t, fully vindicated from this cavil al&s;o.</P>
<P>THO' deacons, in the general &s;en&s;e above, may be called mini&s;ters, yet 'tis plain from their original in&s;titution they never were de&s;igned to be mini&s;ters of the word. The oc|ca&s;ion of their appointment, and the bu&s;ine&s;s they were ap|pointed
<PB N="87" REF="010800_0044_0F81D1CAB2F378E8">to do, is there expre&s;sly &s;aid to be, "to &s;erve tables,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE> and that with a &s;pecial expre&s;s view that the apo&s;tles being relea&s;ed from this care, might be at liberty to pur&s;ue their proper work, to <Q>give them&s;elves to prayer and the mini|&s;try of the word.</Q> Who can once imagine then, that preaching is any part of the deacons bu&s;ine&s;s? That when the apo&s;tles found, that "&s;erving tables was incon&s;i&s;tent with and too much for the mini&s;ters of the word, and accor|dingly in&s;tituted the order of deacons to ea&s;e them of that burden, they &s;hould neverthele&s;s devolve the whole burden of both upon the deacons they had appointed? The apo&s;|tles them&s;elves were not &s;ufficient for both; but the deacons whom they appointed, it &s;eems were, if the doctrine of <HI>preaching deacons</HI> be true. When the deacon is employed in his proper work, I know no body that "de&s;pi&s;es him" (as Mr. L. complains.) It is an honorable office in the church, and ought to be &s;o e&s;teemed. But when he leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s, and becomes <Q>a bu&s;y body in other mens mat|ters,</Q> when he invades an office the &s;cripture never de|&s;igned him, and pre&s;umes to preach as a mini&s;ter of the word; if he is not to be <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> upon this account, mo&s;t certainly he ought to be <HI>rebuked</HI> for his ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>IN my argument from the one commi&s;&s;ion, I had the&s;e words. <Q>Who hath a right to divide the powers Chri&s;t has evidently connected in his commi&s;&s;ion, and give the whole to one order of mini&s;ters, and but half to the other; or rather to create a new order of officers in the church which the go&s;pel knows nothing of</Q>?&mdash;From the&s;e la&s;t words Mr. L. attempts to prove, that I have cut my&s;elf off from a regular ordination. For if either the bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters in their church, are this <Q>new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of;</Q> as we derive our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the bi|&s;hops of their church, by whom our fir&s;t mini&s;ters in this country were ordained, we mu&s;t, he &s;uppo&s;es, derive it from this new order, and therefore our ordinations mu&s;t be null<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. When any officers in Chri&s;t's church, in addi|tion to the powers granted them in the go&s;pel, engro&s;s and exerci&s;e tho&s;e which do not belong to them, they are &s;o far
<PB N="88" REF="010800_0045_0F81D1CE54357640">forth "a new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This I take to be the ca&s;e with dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. They ingro&s;s and monopolize the whole power of ordination and government, which the go&s;pel leaves, in common, to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters. In doing this, they u&s;urp a power, which does not belong to them, and in the exerci&s;e of this u&s;urped power, are "an order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This, however, does not nullify tho&s;e actions, which the go&s;pel impowers them to perform. Now one of the&s;e is ordination. Tho' therefore in <HI>ingro&s;&s;ing the whole power of ordination,</HI> &amp;c. to them&s;elves, they act as <Q>a new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of,</Q> becau&s;e they have no right &s;o to do; yet barely in <HI>ordaining,</HI> they are an order which the go&s;pel owns, becau&s;e, by the go&s;pel, they have a right to ordain. Again, when an order of officers, from principle, neglect a part of the duties of their office, and which their commi&s;&s;ion obliges them to do; they are &s;o far forth, "a new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This is the ca&s;e of the pre&s;byters in the epi&s;copal church. Con&s;idered as &s;et apart to the mini&s;try by ordination, they are lawful go&s;pel mini&s;ters. But con&s;idered as abridging them&s;elves of one half of the powers that belong to them, as living in a &s;tate of &s;ervile &s;ubjection to the bi&s;hop by their oath of canonical obedience; and preaching, not in virtue of Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, but the bi&s;hops licence; they are merely of human in&s;titution, a <Q>new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of.</Q> But until it is proved, that that an officer's pretending to claim and exerci&s;e a power which he has not, de&s;troys and nullifies the power which he lawfully has; Mr. L's con&s;equence, as to the unlawfulne&s;s of my ordination, will by no means follow. If a ju&s;tice of the peace &s;hould pretend to engro&s;s all the authority of his brother-ju&s;tices in a whole county, 'tis plain in &s;o doing, he would be an officer which the law knew nothing of. This, however, would not invalidate tho&s;e acts, which, as a ju&s;|tice, the law impowered him to do. The pope, with his impious and un&s;criptural claim of infallibility and univer&s;al dominion, over the whole chri&s;tian church, I hope Mr. L.
<PB N="89" REF="010800_0045_0F81D1CE54357640">will allow, is an officer which the go&s;pel knows nothing of: And yet he, and all other advocates for uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t derive it from him, or upon their own prin|ciples, they can have no claim to the mini&s;terial character, However therefore this argument of his, might move one to pity its weakne&s;s, I find nothing in it to make us <Q>a|&s;hamed of proper boa&s;ting in the mini&s;terial authority we have received.</Q></P>
<P>IN p. 28 of my &s;ermon I argued, that as a governor and ju&s;tice of the peace being different officers, mu&s;t be impow|ered by different commi&s;&s;ions, &s;o if there were different de|grees of office in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, we might rea&s;onably expect different commi&s;&s;ions, authorizing them to the&s;e offices.</P>
<P>TO this Mr. L. replies, that a governor, by virtue of the king's commi&s;&s;ion, can authorize a ju&s;tice of the peace and other officers, and ju&s;t &s;o the apo&s;tles, by virtue of their commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, "can authorize men of different orders to act in Chri&s;t's name."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. Tho' a governor can authorize a ju&s;tice and other officers which the laws of the king or con&s;titution have appointed, yet he can create no new officer in the &s;tate. So in the other ca&s;e. Tho' the apo&s;tles could ordain &s;uch offi|cers as the go&s;pel had appointed, yet they could make no new ones, different from, or in addition to tho&s;e which the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and the go&s;pel con&s;titution have e&s;tabli&s;hed. We know it was agreeable to the go&s;pel con|&s;titution, that they &s;hould appoint the office of deacon; be|cau&s;e they have in fact done it. Be&s;ides this, we read of no other order appointed by them. If there be any, it be|longs to our opponents to produce them. When Chri&s;t a&s;cended, be left only his eleven apo&s;tles in commi&s;&s;ion; all of one order, all equal it power. Had two or more orders been nece&s;&s;ary in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, he <Q>who was faith|ful in all his hou&s;e.</Q> would certainly have appointed them, or left orders with his apo&s;tles to do it. As he has not; as neither he nor his apo&s;tles have in&s;tituted, except deacons, any more than one order of officers in the go&s;pel
<PB N="90" REF="010800_0046_0F81D1CF146461F8">church, 'tis a certain con&s;equence there are no other. And therefore Mr. L's plea, from what the apo&s;tles were "im|powered to do in authorizing different orders," is nothing to the purpo&s;e. What they were "impowered to do," we mu&s;t judge from what they have in fact done. And as, in fact, they have, be&s;ides deacons, appointed no other order, we may &s;afely pre&s;ume they were not impowered by Chri&s;t to appoint any other. As to the three orders which he &s;ays, they appointed in the church of Jeru&s;alem, it has been al|ready con&s;idered and refuted, and his a&s;&s;ertion proved to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>HIS next attack upon me, is for &s;aying, <Q>that pre&s;byters have a right to govern the church." This, he &s;ays, "I labour hard to prove.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 32.</NOTE> 'Tis true I mentioned this oc|ca&s;ionally, and, I think, &s;ufficiently proved it, without any "hard labour." He him&s;elf allows them &s;ome power of go|vernment. <Q>That they have a right, in &s;ubordination to their apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop, to govern their own &s;tocks.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. What kind or degree of government, the mi&s;|&s;ionary of Norwalk, as a <HI>&s;imple</HI> pre&s;byter, pretends to, or what manner of di&s;cipline he exerci&s;es over the <HI>flock</HI> there. I am not able to &s;ay. This, however, I can &s;ay, that if he exerci&s;es any di&s;cipline at all, as a ruler in the church, it is without book. The canons of his church and the rules of his order, having allowed nothing of this kind to him, but re&s;erved the whole affair to his ordinary. If therefore he &s;hould pre&s;ume to arrogate any &s;uch power, and take it upon him to di&s;cipline any of his unruly <HI>flock.</HI> <Q>I can't &s;ay, (to u&s;e his own words to me) how they will reli&s;h the&s;e high claims of his.</Q> If he &s;hould ever attempt any thing of this kind;&mdash; <Q>unle&s;s he does it under the &s;pecious pretence of appo&s;ing <HI>pre&s;byterians,</HI>"&mdash;"and his people &s;hould once come to be cool, he mu&s;t take a great deal of pains, and u&s;e much art, to bring them tamely to &s;ubmit to this his claim of authority over them.</Q></P>
<P>FOR the direct proof of the pre&s;byters right of govern|ment, the reader is referred to the latter part of this, and the next &s;ection. In the mean time there is one &s;entence
<PB N="91" REF="010800_0046_0F81D1CF146461F8">more in this paragraph, which de&s;erves a remark. It is this. <Q>If he will allow our bi&s;hops, the &s;ame power over the pre&s;byters, that the apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed over their pre&s;by|ters, we will contend for no more in their behalf.</Q></P>
<P>ANSWER. 'Tis granted the apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed authority over tho&s;e he calls pre&s;byters, in the age in which they lived. But the &s;ame did they al&s;o, over tho&s;e he calls bi&s;hops; par|ticularly over Timothy and Titus. If this then is any ar|gument in proof of three orders in the church, in proof of the bi&s;hop's authority over the pre&s;byter now, it equally proves the nece&s;&s;ity of four orders, and will as effectually e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of the pope over all other bi&s;hops, as it will theirs over pre&s;byters. But the authority the apo&s;|tles exerci&s;ed over other go&s;pel mini&s;ters, whether pre&s;by|ters or bi&s;hops, or by whatever name they were called; they did it, not as ordinary mini&s;ters of the church, not as an or|der to be perpetuated; but as apo&s;tles, as officers divinely in&s;pired, &amp;c. When therefore Mr. L. can prove his bi|&s;hops, to have the &s;ame immediate mi&s;&s;ion, miraculous pow|ers, infallible guidance, &amp;c. &amp;c, &amp;c. which con&s;tituted the apo&s;tolic character and &s;uperior authority; it well be then time enough for him to make, and us to grant the above demand.</P>
<P>MR. L. next imputes to me an argument, for &s;upport of our ordination, that I never u&s;ed. He &s;ays <Q>I take a great deal of pains to prove, and often repeat it, that the pow|er of the apo&s;tles, to ordain and govern, was not expre&s;|&s;ed, but only implied in their commi&s;&s;ion"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 32, 33, 34.</NOTE> This, he &s;ays, I do in order to prove that the fir&s;t mini&s;ters of this country had power to ordain, tho' no &s;uch power was expre&s;&s;ed, in the commi&s;&s;ion they received from the bi&s;hops that or|dained them.</Q> * Tho' I never tho't of this argument he here frames for me, yet as he has advanced &s;ome things in his re|marks upon it, which may tend to mi&s;lead the inattentive, it may be proper to make a few ob&s;ervations upon what he here offers.&mdash;He fir&s;t tells me, that to the account of the commi&s;&s;ion in Matt. xxviii. I ought to have joined that giv|en by John; chap. xx. v. 21, 22, 23. Where Chri&s;t &s;ays,
<PB N="92" REF="010800_0047_0F81D1CFF7DDD1A0"><Q>As my father hath &s;ent me, even &s;o &s;end I you.&mdash;Who&s;e|&s;oever &s;ins ye remit," &amp;c&mdash;"If, &s;ays he, we lay toge|ther the accounts, the&s;e two apo&s;tles give of the matter, we &s;hall plainly &s;ee, that in the apo&s;tles commi&s;&s;ion, they were expre&s;sly impowered to &s;end others&mdash;to govern the church&mdash;to preach and to baptize.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. Great weight, I am &s;en&s;ible, is laid by the ad|vocates for prelacy, upon the&s;e words of our Saviour. <Q>as my father hath &s;ent me, &amp;c.</Q> The warm patrons of epi&s;|copacy, pretend here to find, the bi&s;hops exclu&s;ive right to the power of ordination, &amp;c. Tho' by what logic, is diffi|cult to &s;ay. Papi&s;ts, from the &s;ame text, &s;upport the &s;acri|fice of the ma&s;s. For as God the father &s;ent Chri&s;t to of|fer a &s;acrifice for &s;in; &s;o Chri&s;t &s;ent his apo&s;tles, and they o|thers, to offer the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s, that is, the real fle&s;h and blood of Chri&s;t in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper. So that the&s;e words will prove almo&s;t any thing and every thing. Now tho' I don't concieve the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, to be contained in the&s;e words, but rather in tho&s;e Matt. 28. Yet if it will gratify Mr. L. I am willing, for once, to allow it; to allow the commi&s;&s;ion to be collected from both. But then I don't &s;ee what &s;ervice it will be to his cau&s;e. For tho' the power of <HI>government</HI> is rather more particularly ex|pre&s;&s;ed, in John's account than tho&s;e in Matthew's; <HI>the or|daining power,</HI> about which we are contending, is full as clearly expre&s;&s;ed in Matthew as in John: Or rather, it is expre&s;&s;ed in neither. However, tho' the commi&s;&s;ion in Matthew, &s;ays nothing expre&s;sly, about &s;ending others; yet the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's perpetual pre&s;ence, annex't to the commi&s;&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es it, as I &s;hewed in my &s;er|mon; con&s;equently the ordaining power is fairly implied in the commi&s;&s;ion. But the utmo&s;t that can be pretended in John's account, is barely an implication of &s;uch power. Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es that the power "of &s;ending others," is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words; <Q>As my father hath &s;ent me, even &s;o &s;end I you." Here indeed is expre&s;s mention of " the Fa|ther's &s;ending Chri&s;t," and of "Chri&s;t's &s;ending the a|po&s;tles;</Q> but not a &s;ingle word of <Q>the apo&s;tles &s;ending
<PB N="93" REF="010800_0047_0F81D1CFF7DDD1A0">others,</Q> or any thing <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> intimating that &s;uch power was committed to them. In order to this, the words mu&s;t have been, "as I &s;end you, even &s;o do ye &s;end others." Mr. L. I conclude, will &s;ay, that the words, <Q>as my father hath &s;ent me,</Q> &amp;c. contain in them a power committed to the apo&s;tles of <HI>&s;ending</HI> others. I grant they do. But how? Not <HI>expre&s;sly,</HI> but only by implication. But then the &s;ame does the commi&s;&s;ion in Matthew. As to this then, there is no manner of difference. <Q>Perhaps, therefore, (to u&s;e his own words,) no better rea&s;on can be given, why Mr. L. will not allow the commi&s;&s;ion in Matt. 28. to be the only mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, than that it does not comport with his <HI>&s;cheme.</HI></Q> According to "his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" there are three gradations in the mini&s;try. Men mu&s;t be fir&s;t ordained dea|cons, then pre&s;byters, and finally advanced to the highe&s;t order, bi&s;hops. But, for this, he found, one and the &s;ame identical commi&s;&s;ion would not &s;uffice. He has therefore, be&s;ides that mentioned by me, Matt. 28. found, as he thinks, another in John 20. <Q>This, he tells us, Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles, the night after he ro&s;e from the dead,</Q> and &s;o before the other. By this then, according to <Q>his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI></Q> the apo&s;tles mu&s;t have been ordained to no higher order than <HI>deacons,</HI> or at mo&s;t <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI> The other com|mi&s;&s;ion, that in Matthew, he tells us, <Q>was given &s;ome time after in Gallilee, which therefore, "to comport with his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI></Q> mu&s;t have made them <HI>bi&s;hops.</HI> But, unhap|pily for "his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, according to him, contains the powers of <HI>ordination and government,</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> only tho&s;e of <HI>preaching and baptizing.</HI> According to his account, therefore, the apo&s;tles mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> have been ordained to the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> office of bi&s;hops, and <HI>afterwards</HI> to the <HI>lower</HI> one of pre&s;byters or deacons; which, to make the mo&s;t of it, "comports with his <HI>&s;cheme"</HI> but very indifferently, and mu&s;t well nigh "prove fatal to his de&s;ign."</P>
<P>BUT if this will not help his own cau&s;e, he thinks it will overthrow ours. For he &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>if we find that the words of the commi&s;&s;ion that their mini&s;ters received from our bi&s;hops, are not expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch power, (viz, of ordi|nation
<PB N="94" REF="010800_0048_0F81D1D0B81A6570">and government:) We mu&s;t conclude they did not receive &s;uch authority as is pretended.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. If there is but one mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, as has been proved, then all who are lawfully ordained, are ve&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion, and all the powers it contains, of which ordination is one, let the intention of the ordain|ers be what they will. The bi&s;hops, who ordained our fir&s;t mini&s;ters, intended, I hope, to make them lawful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and inve&s;t them with his commi&s;&s;ion; and more|over, u&s;ed words &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch intention. If they did not do this in our ca&s;e, neither did they, I pre|&s;ume, in that of Mr. L. and his brethren: They are there|fore not lawful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, not being ve&s;ted with his commi&s;&s;ion. But if this was done in the ca&s;e of the latter, it was equally &s;o in that of the former; con&s;equently they were ve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's general commi&s;&s;ion and with all the powers of it, and tho&s;e of ordination and govern|ment among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>AS a proof of but one order in the mini&s;try, I mentioned, in my &s;ermon, the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us, Acts xx. and &s;aid, <Q>the intire guidance and government of the church was committed to the&s;e elders, without any men|tion of a &s;ingle per&s;on as their &s;uperior in office.</Q> Here Mr. L. demands, <Q>Where does he find that the govern|ment of the&s;e churches was committed to the&s;e elders.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. I find it in the words directed to them by the apo&s;tle, v. 28. He there charges them in the&s;e words. <Q>Take heed therefore to your&s;elves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you <HI>over&s;eers;</HI> to <HI>feed</HI> the church of God." But he tells me "they are here expre&s;sly &s;aid to be made over&s;eers, not to <HI>govern,</HI> but to <HI>feed</HI> the flock;" and he is really "<HI>amazed</HI> I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that the intire guidance and government of the church is committed to them," for he can &s;ee nothing of it there.</Q> Perhaps the following ob&s;ervations may help him <HI>to &s;ee</HI> it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place. I find this power of government con|tained in the <HI>name,</HI> by which the&s;e elders are there called.
<PB N="95" REF="010800_0048_0F81D1D0B81A6570">The apo&s;tle expre&s;sly calls them <HI>over&s;eers.</HI> He tells them they were made, EPISCOPOUS, bi&s;hops, over this church, and that by the Holy Gho&s;t. This name includes in it the pow|er of rule or guidance. It is rendered, by the be&s;t lexico|graphers, by <HI>epicopus,</HI> bi&s;hop, <HI>in&s;pector,</HI> an in&s;pecter, <HI>prae&s;es,</HI> a pre&s;ident or chief ruler. Accordingly it is the very name that epi&s;copalians have appropriated to the highe&s;t order of their clergy, the bi&s;hops; and that as peculiarly expre&s;&s;ive of the power of government or chief rule. If therefore their bi&s;hops, as &s;uch, are ve&s;ted with the power of govern|ment, the&s;e elders are al&s;o; for they are expre&s;sly called <HI>bi&s;hops;</HI> and were made &s;uch even by the Holy Gho&s;t: Doubtle&s;s the Holy Gho&s;t, in making them bi&s;hops, com|mitted to them the whole power of bi&s;hops, and this of go|vernment among the re&s;t. Mr. L. allows, tho&s;e who are made bi&s;hops, by other bi&s;hops in their church, or even by the grand <HI>pontif</HI> at Rome, to be inve&s;ted with the power of governing the church. But to the&s;e bi&s;hops at Ephe&s;us, who were made &s;uch by the Holy Gho&s;t; he will not al|low any &s;uch power. How partial is this, to &s;ay no more? This power of government therefore is included in the ve|ry <HI>name</HI> by which the&s;e elders are called.</P>
<P>AGAIN. It is included, and that expre&s;sly, in the charges the apo&s;tle gives them. The words are, "to <HI>feed</HI> the flock "of God, POIMAINEIN.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">pa&s;co, <HI>rego,</HI> curo, doceo. Schrevel. Lex. in verb.</NOTE> The word in the original, &s;igni|fies to <HI>rule</HI> or feed, as a &s;hepherd does his flock, and &s;o in|cludes in it all acts of <HI>pa&s;toral</HI> government and care. It is derived from POIMEEN, a &s;hepherd, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is, not only to feed, but to <HI>rule</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> his flock. Which title our Lord applies to him&s;elf, as peculiarly expre&s;&s;ive of his character, as the "chief &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of &s;ouls," and of all that power and authority he exerci&s;es in that character.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John x. ii.</NOTE> Accordingly he u&s;es the word as his apo&s;tle does here, in his charge to Peter an apo&s;tle, and that as expre&s;|&s;ive of the whole care he was to take of Chri&s;t's flock, both in government and in&s;truction.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 16</NOTE> Peter u&s;es the &s;ame word, in his charge to the elders or bi&s;hops of the churches, to whom he directs his epi&s;tle.<NOTE PLACE="foot" N="&Dagger;">1 Pet. v. 2.</NOTE> That the&s;e were the proper

To act the bi&s;hop among them; as al&s;o from his cautioning them again&s;t <Q><HI>lording</HI> it over God's heritage,</Q> i. e. u&s;ing this power of government tyranni|cally. But to put the matter beyond all di&s;pute; we find the word &s;undry times u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament, where it can't po&s;&s;ibly admit of any other interpretation but to <HI>rule,</HI> and therefore is &s;o rendered by our tran&s;lators. Thus when Chri&s;t is &s;poken of under the expre&s;s character of a <HI>gover|nor:</HI> He is &s;aid, as &s;uch, (POIMANEI,) <Q>to <HI>rule</HI> God's peo|ple I&s;rael".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. ii. 6.</NOTE> Again.

And yet becau&s;e our tran&s;|lators u&s;e the word <HI>feed</HI> in this place, Mr. L. confidently a&s;|&s;erts <Q>that the direction given to them, was only to <HI>teach</HI> or <HI>feed</HI> the people over whom they were placed.</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 43.</NOTE> He puts the words <HI>feed</HI> and <HI>teach</HI> in <HI>italics,</HI> and makes them &s;y|nonimous terms; at the &s;ame time he &s;ets both in oppo&s;i|tion to <HI>ruling</HI> or <HI>governing,</HI> which is the original meaning of the word; and then tells us, <Q>the&s;e words expre&s;sly declare, what they were made over&s;eers to do; that was, to <HI>feed</HI> the church of God; there is not the lea&s;t intimation they were to <HI>govern</HI> it." And he "is really <HI>amazed,</HI> he &s;ays, that I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert the contrary, when the place referred to &s;o expre&s;sly &s;ays, that the Holy Gho&s;t made them over|&s;eers, not to <HI>govern,</HI> but to <HI>feed</HI> the church of God.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 35.</NOTE> What the poor gentleman's <HI>amazement</HI> aro&s;e from, whether

I hope he did not do this, with a di&s;hone&s;t de&s;ign, to impo&s;e upon his unlearned read|ers. I will not therefore tell him as he <HI>politely</HI> does me, "that he him&s;elf knew the contrary to be true." This, how|ever I will tell him, that if he did not, he was utterly un|qualified for the controver&s;y he has undertaken, and there|fore ought to have declined it.</P>
<P>HAVING thus made good the a&s;&s;ertion in my &s;ermon, "that the government of the church was ve&s;ted in the&s;e elders, the argument deduced from it in &s;upport of pre&s;by|terian ordination &s;till &s;tands good. The inference Mr. L. draws from what he calls "this claim of mine, as to the ef|fect which he &s;uppo&s;es it will have, upon the minds of my hearers, gives me not the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. The communi|cants of our church, which he is plea&s;ed to call the <HI>meeting</HI> of Stanford, by twenty years experience, well know my principles and practice, as to church government.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VII.</HI> A particular con&s;ideration and refutation of what Mr. L. calls "his direct proof of epi&s;copacy, from matters of fact recorded in &s;cripture," from <HI>p. 38</HI> to <HI>48.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE whole of what our author calls <Q>his direct proof of epi&s;copacy," turns upon "the directions given by the apo&s;tle to Timothy, compared with his charge to the elders of Ephe&s;us." "There are &s;ome things, &s;ays he, given in charge to the&s;e elders, in common with Timo|thy: Such as,&mdash;to take heed to them&s;elves and to their doctrine, &amp;c." "But be&s;ides the&s;e, he tells us, there are &s;everal particulars, of great importance, that Paul gave in charge to Timothy, which he did not &s;o much as mention to all the&s;e elders.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 39.</NOTE>&mdash;Particularly.&mdash;He informs him as to the qualifications of pre&s;byters and deacons.&mdash;Orders him to charge &s;ome that they teach no other doctrine.&mdash;Charges him to lay hands &s;uddenly on no man.&mdash;Directs him how to receive an accu&s;ation again&s;t an elder.&mdash;Orders him to rebuke them that &s;in, before all. &mdash; And finally charges him to keep this commandment unrebukable, till the appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <Q>The&s;e things, he &s;ays, Paul gave in charge to Timothy, but did not &s;o much as men|tion them to the elders of Ephe&s;us." Hence he infers,
<PB N="99" REF="010800_0050_0F81D1D235160EB0">that Timothy was &s;uperior in office to the&s;e elders, and charged with the government of them, and of the church at Ephe&s;us."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 43, 44.</NOTE> He then concludes, "that Timothy had the &s;ame authority that their bi&s;hops claim, and the elders the &s;ame power only that the pre&s;byters, in their church, exerci&s;e, con&s;equently, "that epi&s;copacy is of <HI>divine right,</HI> and the whole di&s;pute is at an end.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 44.</NOTE> This is the true &s;tate of his argument pre&s;ented in its full force. It turns wholly upon this.&mdash; <Q>Timothy had <HI>more, and more impor|tant</HI> charges given him than the&s;e elders, therefore he was &s;uperior to them in office,&mdash;ve&s;ted with epi&s;copal autho|rity over them.</Q>&mdash; In an&s;wer to which I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT if this argument proves Timothy &s;uperior to the&s;e elders; it equally proves Peter &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hes the &s;upremacy of the pope above all other bi&s;hops, according to the doctrine of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the whole hi&s;tory of the go&s;pel, that Peter is, in various re&s;pects, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other apo&s;tles. Whenever their catalogue is given, he is placed the fir&s;t.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 10.2.</NOTE> Are any &s;elect number cho&s;en, upon any &s;pecial occa&s;ion, Peter is always one.

And what is remarkable, the&s;e are the very arguments u&s;ed by the church of Rome, to e&s;tabli&s;h the pope's &s;upremacy, as Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and give him a &s;u|periority to all other officers in the chri&s;tian church. If therefore they are &s;ufficient to prove Timothy's &s;uperiority to the elders of Ephe&s;us, they are equally &s;o to prove that of Peter to the other apo&s;tles, and, con&s;equently, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;upremacy of the pope over all other mini&s;ters. As the argument is the &s;ame, it is certainly as conclu&s;ive, in the mouth of an Italian roman-catholic, for the pope's &s;upremacy, as in that of an Engli&s;h prelati&s;t for the bi&s;hop's &s;uperiority. And indeed it is worthy of note, that there is no one argument u&s;ed, by the latter, for the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy again&s;t pre&s;byterians; but what has been u&s;ed with equal force, and equal &s;ucce&s;s, by the former for the <HI>divine right</HI> of the <HI>papacy,</HI> again&s;t prote&s;tants. If then our author in&s;i&s;ts upon this argument, as conclu&s;ive in his ca&s;e, he mu&s;t own it to be equally &s;o, in that of the pope, and, to be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, mu&s;t turn Roman-catholic: Or if he denies it in one ca&s;e, he mu&s;t give it up in the other, and own there is no force in it when brought to e&s;ta|bli&s;h dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy.&mdash;Moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. IF this argument proves Timothy's &s;uperiority to the elders of Ephe&s;us, it will equally follow, and upon the &s;ame principles, that he was &s;uperior to many others al&s;o, whom yet Mr. L. him&s;elf allows to be bi&s;hops in his &s;en&s;e of the
<PB N="101" REF="010800_0051_0F81D1476FC16720">word. He has told us that Barnabas was an apo&s;tle or bi|&s;hop;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 22.</NOTE> that Epaphroditus was the bi&s;hop of Philippi, and James of the church at Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 20.</NOTE> But no where will he find tho&s;e particular directions given to them, as are here given to Timothy. Where does he find Barnabas the apo&s;|tle, James the bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, or Epaphroditus of Phi|lippi receiving tho&s;e <HI>more, and more important charges,</HI> which, as he pretends, di&s;tingui&s;h and prove the epi&s;copal character of Timothy bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us? In this re&s;pect even the Ephe&s;ian elders, to whom yet out author will not allow the epi&s;copal authority, have evidently the advantage. For they, he allows, received charges and directions from the apo&s;tle, tho' not &s;o <HI>many</HI> and <HI>important</HI> as Timothy did. But the&s;e, whom neverthele&s;s he owns were proper bi&s;hops, received no &s;uch charges. Either therefore he mu&s;t re|nounce the epi&s;copal character of James, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. and give up his argument for epi&s;copacy thence ari&s;ing; or el&s;e he mu&s;t allow the&s;e elders of Ephe&s;us to be bi&s;hops, and &s;o give up his pre&s;ent argument; or finally, which will a|mount to the &s;ame, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e Timothy to be &s;uperior to both, and, by divine right, an arch-bi&s;hop, a prince apo&s;tle or pope. Nay further, as there are no &s;uch particular di|rections and <HI>important</HI> charges, in &s;cripture, given, even to the twelve apo&s;tles them&s;elves, as are here given to Timo|thy, it mu&s;t follow, from this argument, that Timothy was &s;uperior even to them. And that altho' he received his di|rections and charges from the apo&s;tle Paul, he was never|thele&s;s Paul's &s;uperior: For we no where find &s;uch parti|cular directions and <HI>important</HI> charges given even to him, as are here given to Timothy. Thus this argument for Timothy's &s;uperior power and character, while it deprives the Ephe&s;ian bi&s;hops of pa&s;toral authority at the &s;ame time cuts off all others mentioned in &s;cripture, even the apo&s;tles not excepted, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government.</P>
<P>THERE is no way, I conceive, to get clear of this difficul|ty, upon his &s;cheme, but only by &s;uppo&s;ing, that tho' the apo&s;tles had not the&s;e particular directions given them that

<P>AND as to "the one &s;olemn charge more" &s;o very re|markable, mentioned by our author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 42.</NOTE> as given to Timothy, viz. <Q>of keeping the commandment till the coming of Chri&s;t," &s;ince he him&s;elf tells us "that this is of like na|ture with the promi&s;e to the apo&s;tles, <HI>that Chri&s;t would be with them to the end of the world;</HI></Q> it is evident from what he expre&s;sly allows el&s;ewhere, that this mu&s;t belong to the&s;e pre&s;byters, equally with Timothy, even upon &s;uppo&s;ition Ti|mothy was their &s;uperior.

<P N="4">4. THAT Timothy could not be the bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, left there with ordaining power, &amp;c. is evident from Mr. L's own definition of an officer ve&s;ted with that power.

But now Timothy is no where in &s;cripture called an apo&s;tle, and therefore, ac|cording to his own definition, could not be left at Ephe&s;us with power to ordain. Pity it is he had not thought of this. It would have &s;aved him all the learned labour of his <Q>di|rect proof of epi&s;copacy.</Q> And tho' it would have de|prived him of the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e confident triumphs, with which the conclu&s;ion of it is ornamented, and robed him of the applau&s;e which his zealous admirers lavi&s;h upon this part of his performance more e&s;pecially; yet, in the judgment of the impartial, <Q>his book would have been as good as it is now, tho' not quite &s;o long.</Q></P>
<P>BUT perhaps he will endeavour to prove, for he told us he de&s;igned it, tho' it &s;hould &s;eem, he afterwards forgot his promi&s;e, <Q>that Timothy was admitted to the apo&s;tolic office.</Q> But if he was, why is he never called an apo&s;tle? Paul frequently joyns him with him&s;elf, in the in&s;cription of his epi&s;tles. And tho' he takes to him&s;elf the name of apo&s;tle, yet, 'tis remarkable, he never once gives it to Ti|mothy. His &s;tile is, <Q>Paul an apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Timothy a brother.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.1. Col. 1.1.</NOTE> Now how can this be accounted for if Timothy was an apo&s;tle? Would the meek, the hum|ble St. Paul arrogate to him&s;elf the honorable title of apo&s;|tle, and deny it to Timothy, to whom it was equally due? Mo&s;t certainly not. Be&s;ides, if Timothy was an apo&s;tle, he was equal to St. Paul. But that he was not, is plain from the authority Paul exerci&s;es over him. He every where treats him, not as an equal, but an inferior. He writes e|pi&s;tles to him, in which he warns, directs, charges, com|mands him, in the mo&s;t authoritative manner.

<PB N="107" REF="010800_0054_0F81D149C29D53A8">meek and humble &s;pirit? Certainly not.

In &s;hort Paul exerci&s;es the &s;ame authority over Timothy, and that even in tho&s;e directions and charges, on which however, our author founds his epi&s;copal or apo&s;tolic character, as he does over the elders of Ephe&s;us. This would incline one to think, Timothy was &s;uperior to the&s;e elders in no re&s;pects.</P>
<P>But if he was, yet.</P>
<P N="5">5. HE was an evangeli&s;t, and therefore could not be, as Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, a re&s;ident governor or fixed bi&s;hop in Ephe&s;us, or any other place. That he was an evangeli&s;t we learn from 2 Tim. 4.6. Now the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of an evangeli&s;t was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with a fixed relation to any church, as its &s;tated pa&s;tor or bi&s;hop. He was a kind of &s;ubordinate apo&s;tle, an extraordinary and temporary of|ficer, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to travel from place to place and water the churches which the apo&s;tles had planted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 3.6.</NOTE> Or, as Eu&s;cbius expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>To lay the foundation of faith in &s;trange nations, to con&s;titute them pa&s;tors; and having committed to them the cultivating the&s;e new plantations, to pa&s;s on to other countries and nations.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eccl, Hi&s;t, Lib. 3. cap. 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS argument of Mr. L's for epi&s;copacy, wholly de|pends upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of Timothy's being fixed at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> over the elders of that church, as their proper bi|&s;hop, with ordaining and governing powers. He every where &s;uppo&s;es him to be &s;uch a fixed officer in that church. <Q>He enquires, whether Paul has not given Timothy, a much more exten&s;ive charge to be exerci&s;ed by him at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> than he gave to the elders of <HI>the &s;ame church.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 39.</NOTE> Speaks of him <Q>as inve&s;ted with power over the church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI></Q>&mdash;and charged with the government of the church at <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 43.45.</NOTE> He every where &s;uppo&s;es him to be a <HI>fixed</HI> officer in that church, and the whole of his argument depends upon this &s;ingle circum&s;tance. If he can't prove this, all his argument in favour of epi&s;copacy, from the more
<PB N="108" REF="010800_0055_0F81D14A6CA0ED40">particular directions given to Timothy, than to the&s;e Ephe|&s;ian elders, comes to nothing. This Mr. L. indeed does not once attempt to prove. He &s;eems rather to take it for granted: And &s;o having begged the main que&s;tion in di&s;|pute, proceeds to argue from it in &s;upport of his &s;cheme. And all the evidence that epi&s;copalians ever bring, in proof of this main fact, is <Q>Paul's be&s;eeching of him to abide &s;till in Ephe&s;us, while he went into Macedonia.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.3.</NOTE> But does this found like the language of an apo&s;tle to a fixed pa&s;tor of a church? If Ephe&s;us was his &s;tated charge, why is he <HI>be&s;ought</HI> to abide there, when he could do no otherwi&s;e, without neglecting his duty and &s;inning again&s;t God? And why is he <HI>intreated</HI> to abide there, only while Paul went into Macedonia? If he was bi&s;hop of that church, a &s;tated re&s;idence there, was his indi&s;putible duty, not only for that &s;hort period, but during life. And he would need no <HI>en|treaties</HI> to oblige him to it, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the doctrine of <HI>non-re&s;idence,</HI> &s;o much e&s;pou&s;ed by &s;ome of his pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, was then in vogue. But con&s;idered as an evan|geli&s;t, an unfixed itinerant mi&s;&s;ionary, &s;uch an entreaty was highly proper. And &s;uch an one, 'tis plain from &s;cripture, he was. Accordingly, as he is here de&s;ired, by the apo&s;|tle, to &s;tay, for a &s;ea&s;on at Ephe&s;us; &s;o we find him upon another occa&s;ion &s;ent to Corinth. 1 Cor. 16.10. He is with Paul again, when he wrote his &s;econd epi&s;tle to that church. 2 Cor. 1.1. As al&s;o when he wrote his epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians. chap. 1. v. 1. At Baerea he was with Paul, and <HI>abode there &s;till</HI> with Silas. Acts 17.14. The word is the &s;ame, as is u&s;ed for his continuing at Ephe&s;us.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">VPEMENON, PROSMEINAI.</NOTE> If therefore, in the one in&s;tance, his &s;o abiding makes him bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us; it equally makes him bi&s;hop of Baerea in the other. 'Tis true he &s;oon left Baerea, and followed Paul to Athens, Acts 17.15. But 'tis equally true that he was to &s;tay at Ephe&s;us, only till Paul fini&s;hed his journey to Macedonia, and returned to him again. I Tim. 3.14. Chap. 4.13. And in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, which was written not long after the fir&s;t, it is mo&s;t probable, from chap. 4. v. 12. that he had left Ephe&s;us already: But
<PB N="109" REF="010800_0055_0F81D14A6CA0ED40">if he had not, 'tis certain he then left it; for the apo&s;tle there calls him away to Rome, and &s;ends Tychicus, another evangeli&s;t to Ephe&s;us. 2 Tim. 4.9., 12, 21. Eph. 6.21, 22. In 1 The&s;. 1.1. we find him in Athens; whence he was &s;ent to The&s;&s;alonica, and from thence returned back to Athens. 1 The&s;. 3.1, 2, 6. After this he removed with Paul to Corinth. Acts 18.5. From thence he accompanied him to A&s;ia and Ephe&s;us. Acts 19.1. And thence he was &s;ent into Macedonia. v. 21, 22. But it would be tedious to follow him, in all his travels to &s;o many different places. Enough has been mentioned of his unfixed, itinerant man|ner of life, to &s;hew he was an evangeli&s;t, and therefore could not be a fixed re&s;ident officer in any church. The &s;ame might be &s;hewn as to Titus, whom epi&s;copalians make to be bi&s;hop of Crete, barely becau&s;e the apo&s;tle, for &s;ome &s;hort time left him there for certain purpo&s;es. There is the cleare&s;t evidence from &s;cripture, that they were both of them impowered in the work of evangeli&s;ts. And as this was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with their &s;u&s;taining a relation to any particular church, as their fixed pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops, 'tis a clear con&s;equence they did not &s;u&s;tain &s;uch relation. There|fore all our author has argued in &s;upport of epi&s;copacy from the&s;e directions given to Timothy, is nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. AS the &s;cripture is wholly &s;ilent as to this notion of Timothy's epi&s;copal care of Ephe&s;us; &s;o there is nothing in any of the ancient fathers to &s;upport this opinion, but much to the contrary. Dr. Whitby, who was well read in the fathers, confe&s;&s;es, as I &s;hewed in my &s;ermon, <Q>that as to the great controver&s;y, whether Timothy and Titus were indeed bi&s;hops, the one of Ephe&s;us, the other of Crete, he could find nothing of this matter in any writer of the three fir&s;t centuries, nor any intimation that they bore that name." He adds indeed, "that this defect is abundantly &s;upplied by the concurrent &s;uffrage of the fourth and fifth." "But the&s;e, as Dr. Chauncy ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, were times too far di&s;tant from Timothy and Ti|tus, to be relied on for the truth of this fact; e&s;pecially, as in the&s;e times they had greatly departed from the &s;im|plicity

Lec. p. 51.</NOTE> And if Mr. L's quotations from Iraeneus be true, this &s;ilence of the fathers for 300 years, concerning the fact in que&s;tion, is a certain evidence it ne|ver did exi&s;t. Iraeneus's words, as quoted by our author, are,&mdash; <Q>We can reckon tho&s;e bi&s;hops who have been con|&s;tituted by the apo&s;tles, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all the way to our time.&mdash;We have the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hops, to whom the apo&s;tolic church was committed in every place.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 51.</NOTE> Now &s;ince, Iraeneus lived in the &s;econd century; if they had in his time, as he declares, "the true &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi|&s;hops in <HI>every</HI> church, and yet there is nothing to be found of Timothy and Titus in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for Ephe&s;us and Crete, as Dr. Whitby a&s;&s;erts; 'tis an undeniable con&s;e|quence that they never were bi&s;hops of the&s;e churches, let the writers in following ages &s;ay what they will to the con|trary.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it is evident from eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that the apo&s;tle John was at Ephe&s;us, and <HI>re&s;ided</HI> there for a con&s;i|derable time after Paul's departure thence, and after the writing the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, on which his pretended epi&s;copacy over that church, is founded. Eu&s;cbius, upon the te&s;timony of Iraeneus and Clemens Alexandrinus, af|firms, <Q>that he returned to Ephe&s;us, after his relea&s;e from bani&s;hment, and lived there, and among the A&s;ian church|es until Trajan's reign.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;cb. Hi&s;. cul. Lib. 3.17. Iraen adv. Hae.

<P N="7">7. AND la&s;tly, we need not recur to eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory for proof of this point. The &s;acred &s;criptures abundantly prove, that not Timothy, but the elders of Ephe&s;us, were the true and only <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of this church. This is evident from the account given of them in Acts 20.17&mdash;36. Be|fore this, Paul had been &s;ucce&s;sfully labouring for near three years in and about Ephe&s;us. Great numbers had been con|verted to the faith. A flouri&s;hing church gathered and el|ders

And now that the apo&s;tle was about to leave them, never to &s;ee them more; as one deeply concerned for them, &s;ince he could not vi&s;it the church in per&s;on, he &s;ends for the elders of it, preaches his farewell &s;ermon to them, and gives them his la&s;t directions and charge, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn and moving addre&s;s. In all which there is not one word mentioned, or the lea&s;t hint given, of &s;etting a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on over them as their bi&s;hop. So far from this, the whole government of the church is expre&s;sly commit|ted to <HI>them</HI> and them only, in a &s;tate of equality. And what is remarkable, tho' Timothy was probably now pre&s;ent, not a &s;ingle word is &s;aid of his relation to this church. No di|rections are given to <HI>him</HI> as the governor of it, nor the lea&s;t hint mentioned to the&s;e elders, to con&s;ider and obey him as their &s;uperior: But <HI>they,</HI> the elders, are the only per&s;ons mentioned as the appointed officers in it. They are ex|pre&s;sly called its <HI>bi&s;hops;</HI> yea are declared to be appointed &s;uch by the Holy Gho&s;t. The care and guidance of the church, in all things, is committed to them, and they are, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, charged to feed, teach, <HI>rule and govern</HI> it, as its only proper pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops. And what puts the matter beyond di&s;pute, they are commanded to do this with an expre&s;s view to prevent the future di&s;orders which the apo&s;tle fore&s;aw, were about to ari&s;e in this church, by <Q>grievous wolves, men &s;peaking perver&s;e things," thru&s;ting them&s;elves in," "to draw away di&s;ciples after them.</Q> This is the expre&s;s rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for giving this charge. To prevent this, they are commanded to <HI>watch,</HI> to <HI>rule</HI> and govern the flock committed to their care, and exerci&s;e that authority, which, as its proper pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops, they were ve&s;ted with, in warning their people a|gain&s;t tho&s;e grievous wolves, convincing the&s;e gain&s;ayers, or by exerci&s;ing their pa&s;toral authority, in way of di&s;ci|pline; to put to &s;ilence the&s;e corrupt teachers. But now how incon&s;i&s;tent will all this appear, if they were not the pa&s;tors, but only the &s;ubject pre&s;byters of this church, as our author affirms? What propriety, in giving them, and them only, this &s;olemn charge, when they had no power,
<PB N="112" REF="010800_0057_0F81D14E1810B4A0">no authority to comply with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches of it? How ab&s;urd, to direct them in the government and di&s;cipline of this church, both as to private members and corrupt teachers, when they could exerci&s;e no authority over either, and at the &s;ame time, intirely to omit Timothy, to whom, and only whom, upon the epi&s;copalian &s;cheme, the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s belonged? The &s;uppo&s;ition is ri|diculous. It de&s;troys the whole force of the apo&s;tle's rea|&s;oning, and renders his di&s;cour&s;e quite impertinent.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, no doubt, had a tender concern for the fu|ture welfare and good government of this church. He had long pre&s;ided over it in per&s;on. He was now taking his final leave of its officers, never to &s;ee them more.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v. 25.</NOTE> The elders under&s;tood him in this &s;en&s;e. They took leave of him, as their apo&s;tolic father, in a manner mo&s;t tender and affecting, with many tears. <Q>Sorrowing mo&s;t of all for the words which he &s;pake, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">v. 38.</NOTE> This then was the proper time, to provide for the future guidance of this church, and its officers; to provide a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on to &s;ucceed him in the government of it, had this been the &s;cripture model, as our opponents pre|tend. Had this been the go&s;pel plan, certainly Paul would not have concealed it from the&s;e elders, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time as this. He called them to record, <Q>that he was pure from the blood of all men," "that he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, nor &s;hunned to declare unto them, the whole coun&s;el of God.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">v. 20, 26, 27.</NOTE> And then immediately adds, <Q>that the Holy Gho&s;t had made them the <HI>fixed</HI> over&s;eers, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> or pa&s;tors of this church,</Q> without &s;o much as hinting that any one was to pre&s;ide o|ver them. Had <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> "been profitable to them," the apo&s;tle mu&s;t have known it. Had it been any part of the "coun&s;el of God," he mu&s;t have told them &s;o; for he "kept back nothing of that." Now was the proper time to have done it when he was giving them his la&s;t, his part|ing directions. But neither before, nor now, does he men|tion a word of any &s;uch thing. On the contrary, he ex|pre&s;sly commits to the&s;e pre&s;byters, in a &s;tate of parity, the
<PB N="113" REF="010800_0057_0F81D14E1810B4A0">whole government of this church, which plainly &s;hews, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy was no part of "the coun&s;el of God," and therefore not of divine in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN this view of the ca&s;e, the <HI>directions</HI> given to Timothy, while at Ephe&s;us, (if indeed he was there when he received them,) will nothing weaken the force of this conclu&s;ion: And yet on them, the whole &s;trength of Mr. L's argument depends. For, granting he was there, when he received the&s;e epi&s;tles; yet all &s;kilful chronologi&s;ts agree, they were wrote, long before this convention of Paul, and the elders at Miletus; and mo&s;t probably, before the church of E|phe&s;us was &s;ettled according to go&s;pel order, with pre&s;by|ters appointed in it. If this was the ca&s;e, the <HI>directions</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ent to Timothy, for there was no other officer to whom they could be &s;ent. His &s;tay, however, at Ephe&s;us, was but &s;hort at the longe&s;t. He was &s;oon called away by the apo&s;tle, and there is no account that he ever returned. If he did, it could not be as their bi&s;hop; for this office was conferred upon the elders, by the expre&s;s direction of the Holy Gho&s;t. Ve&s;ted with this office, the apo&s;tle found them, when they met him at Miletus; and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, he left them, when he took his final leave of them, never to &s;ee them more. Judge then, who is to be credit|ed in this ea&s;e; our author, who &s;ays the&s;e elders were only &s;imple pre&s;byters, without any pa&s;toral authority in this church; or the apo&s;tle, who expre&s;sly charges them, to exerci&s;e &s;uch authority in the government of it!&mdash;Mr. L. who confidently a&s;&s;erts, that Timothy was their only bi&s;hop, to whom they and the church of Ephe&s;us were &s;ub|jected, as their &s;ingle pa&s;tor or over&s;eer; or St. Paul, who a&s;&s;ures us, that the&s;e elders were appointed by the Holy Gho&s;t, in parity, the <HI>over&s;eers</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of this whole flock! <Q>Look into the &s;criptures. Judge for your&s;elves. If what I have advanced, is not fact, it may be ea&s;ily ex|po&s;ed. If it is an undeniable truth, it is a truth of great importance, if religion be &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>I AM now prepared for a few remarks upon &s;ome &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages in this part of Mr. L's defence, which will con|clude this &s;ection.</P>

HE enquires,&mdash; <Q>If the elders of Ephe&s;us had power to ordain and govern, what need of <HI>&s;ending</HI> Timothy there?</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 43.</NOTE> <HI>leaving</HI> him there, he &s;hould have &s;aid. &mdash; I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>IT does not appear from &s;cripture, that this church had any &s;ettled pa&s;tors at this time. But if it had, they needed the divine directions concerning ordination and government, contained in the&s;e epi&s;tles to Timothy, as much as we do at this day. And who more proper to receive, and put them in execution, than an evangeli&s;t, an extraordinary of|ficer, and a faithful companion of Paul? But till he can prove that Timothy was left there, as a re&s;ident pa&s;tor over that church, as fully as I have, that the elders were, this will be no &s;ervice to his cau&s;e. Barely his being <HI>&s;ent to</HI> Ephe&s;us, will not prove this. If &s;o Tychicus al&s;o was their bi&s;hop, for he was &s;ent there as well as Timothy. And upon the &s;ame principle, Timothy mu&s;t have been bi&s;hop al&s;o of Co|rinth, The&s;&s;alonica, Macedonia, &amp;c. for to all the&s;e was he &s;ent as well as to Ephe&s;us. This would be to make him a <HI>prelati&s;t</HI> as well as a <HI>non-re&s;ident,</HI> and exhibit a compleat idea of modern epi&s;copacy. Again,</P>
<P>HE demands a proof from facts recorded in &s;cripture, <Q>that <HI>mere</HI> pre&s;byters, in virtue of their office as &s;uch, did ordain officers in the church of Chri&s;t.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 46, 47.</NOTE> An&s;wer,</P>
<P>IF by <HI>mere</HI> pre&s;byters, he means, &s;uch as tho&s;e in his church, profe&s;&s;edly &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to bi&s;hops, and di&s;claiming all pa&s;toral authority in ordination and govern|ment; none will pretend to prove from &s;cripture that &s;uch ever did ordain. And good rea&s;on for it. The &s;cripture knows of no &s;uch order. But if he means &s;cripture-pre&s;|byters, &s;uch as tho&s;e at Ephe&s;us; pre&s;byter-bi&s;hops, &s;uch as Timothy and Titus were directed to ordain; I have al|ready proved, &s;uch pre&s;byters did in fact ordain, and that by virtue of their office. Of this &s;ort were tho&s;e, who or|dained Paul, Barnabas and Timothy, as I have already proved, <HI>by expre&s;s facts recorded in &s;cripture.</HI> And what is more: The &s;criptures plainly &s;hew, that none but &s;uch ought to ordain; they being the only mini&s;ters, authorized by Chri&s;t's general commi&s;&s;ion, and ve&s;ted with all the pow|ers it contains.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="010800_0058_0F81D14EF6816E20">
WHAT he quotes from Mr. Beach, re&s;pecting our fir&s;t mini&s;ters, who were ordained by the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, is no valid objection again&s;t this, even allowing that there was no expre&s;&s;ed intention, either in the ordainers, or ordained, of conveying the power of ordination. For the commi&s;&s;i|on of Chri&s;t, not the intention of the ordainers, is what conveys the power in ordination, as I &s;hewed in my &s;er|mon. I now add.&mdash;The&s;e fir&s;t mini&s;ters of N. England were ordained, I conclude, in the &s;ame manner as Mr. L. and his brethren were. Either therefore he is no mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, not being ve&s;ted with his commi&s;&s;ion in ordina|tion: Or if the words u&s;ed in his ordination, were &s;uffici|ently expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch inve&s;titure, in his ca&s;e: they were equally &s;o in that of our mini&s;ters; con&s;equently, they were cloathed with all the powers the commi&s;&s;ion contains, of which that of ordination is confe&s;&s;edly one.</P>
<P>AS to the other part of this objection, the oath of cano|nical obedience; tho' it is far from being true, that this, as he affirms, includes in it <Q>a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to or|dain others;</Q> yet allowing it did, &s;uch promi&s;e, being evidently &s;inful, can't be binding upon con&s;cience, but is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> null and void. A number of the Jews bound them&s;elves by &s;olemn oath, <Q>not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 23.12.</NOTE> If this oath was binding, it was their duty to keep it; con&s;equently murder is a duty. For the murder of Paul or of them&s;elves, was a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of their keeping this oath. But if it was not bind|ing in this in&s;tance, no more was it in the ca&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es, con&s;equently the objection is of no force.</P>
<P>MR. L. &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>Nothing is now claimed by our bi&s;hops, but the very &s;ame that St. Paul gave in charge to Timo|thy. Nothing prohibited to the elders and pre&s;byters of our church, that he commanded the elders to do, at Ephe|&s;us.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 47.48.</NOTE> Is this really the ca&s;e? Do not their bi&s;hops <HI>claim</HI> a power of admini&s;tring the &s;acraments, of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper? But where will he find this mentioned in Paul's charge to Timothy? Do not the former <HI>claim</HI> the power of confirmation and ab&s;olution? But does Paul men|tion
<PB N="116" REF="010800_0059_0F81D14FB50F7F00">either, in his charge to the latter? The bi&s;hops in their church, <HI>claim</HI> the whole exclu&s;ive power of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rule or government. But where do we find Paul giving this to Timothy? On the contrary, does he not expre&s;sly <HI>charge</HI> him, that tho&s;e pre&s;byters he was to ordain, &s;hould be <Q>men that ruled well their own hou&s;es, that they might be able to <HI>rule</HI> the church of God?</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 2.4, 5.</NOTE> Does he not ex|pre&s;ly command, <Q>let the elders who <HI>rule</HI> well be account|ed worthy of double honour?</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Cap. 5. v. 15.</NOTE> But what occa&s;ion for this, if the bi&s;hop had the &s;ole power of government? I add; where does he find the apo&s;tle <HI>charging</HI> his grace, Timothy lord bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, <Q>to entangle him&s;elf with the affairs of this life:</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.4.</NOTE> To intermeddle, and bear a chief part in civil matters, to erect courts, and pre&s;ide in them, either in per&s;on, or by his <HI>lay</HI> chancellor, for the trial of all cau&s;es, te&s;tamentary and matrimonial, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.? And yet he knows a &s;et of bi&s;hops, pretending to be the only &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Timothy and the apo&s;tles, who actually <HI>claim</HI> and exerci&s;e all the fore-mentioned powers. Paul tells the Ephe&s;ian elders, <Q>that the Holy Gho&s;t had made them pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops over the whole flock.</Q> and charges them to exerci&s;e the powers of &s;uch, to feed, to <HI>rule</HI> and go|vern this church as its proper bi&s;hops, to u&s;e their authori|ty, if nece&s;&s;ary, in a way of di&s;cipline, and prevent fal&s;e teachers creeping in, to draw away di&s;ciples: And is there any thing, I a&s;k, of this kind, <HI>allowed</HI> to Mr. L. and his brother-pre&s;byters in their church? Not in the lea&s;t. He him&s;elf knows, that by the rules and canons of his order, he is ab&s;olutely <HI>prohibited</HI> every thing of this kind.</P>
<P>THUS have I an&s;wered every thing material in this part of our author's defence;&mdash;particularly &s;hewed, from <HI>facts recorded in &s;cripture,</HI> that Timothy neither was, nor could be a fixed bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, &s;ettled there, with governing, powers over the&s;e elders; but that this church was mo&s;t e|vidently &s;ettled upon the pre&s;byterian plan,&mdash;that St. Paul when taking his leave of it, never to &s;ee it more, very ex|pre&s;sly left the intire guidance of it, not to a &s;ingle per&s;on, not to Timothy, but to the&s;e elders in a &s;tate of parity; con|&s;equently,
<PB N="117" REF="010800_0059_0F81D14FB50F7F00">that this is the true &s;criptural plan of church or|der and government, and therefore, pre&s;byters, or ordinary pa&s;tors, in &s;uch &s;tate of equality, have the power of ordina|tion, &amp;c committed to them.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to add, but my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h and prayer, that the great head of the church would guide us into all truth, and in&s;pire all prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially go&s;pel mini&s;ters, with the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, forbearance and cha|rity towards each other, even tho' not exactly of one mind in all points; that &s;o, in&s;tead of worrying and cruelly con|demning our fellow chri&s;tians, and thereby, giving advan|tage again&s;t us to the partrons of popery, infidelity and ir|religion; we may all cordially unite, in oppo&s;ing the com|mon enemies of chri&s;tianity, and promoting the grand and important truths, in which we all agree.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> Mr. L's proof of epi&s;copacy from the writings of the fathers, contained in his appendix, <HI>from p. 49, to 61,</HI> examined and refuted.</HEAD>
<P>OUR author propo&s;es, in this part of his work, <Q>to en|quire what form of government prevailed, imme|diately after the apo&s;tles. "To an&s;wer this enquiry, he tells us, he will exhibit a few extracts, from the ancient fathers.</Q></P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t <HI>extract</HI> is, from that truly <HI>ancient apo&s;tolic father,</HI> arch-deacon Echard of England, who flouri&s;hed about A. D. 1699. But what purpo&s;e this <HI>extract</HI> is de&s;igned to &s;erve, the reader mu&s;t determine for him&s;elf, for I am not able to help him.</P>
<P>HIS next is from Eu&s;ebius. He, I own, is one of the <HI>fathers;</HI> but far from being an <HI>ancient</HI> one: For he lived in the fourth century. And as he him&s;elf tells us, in his hi&s;tory <Q>that he could trace no foot&s;teps of any going be|fore him, only in a few narratives,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE> there is little depen|dence upon what he &s;ays, of things &s;o remote from his time. However the pa&s;&s;age quoted is this. <Q>St. John, being by Domitian's death, relea&s;ed from bani&s;hment, returned,
<PB N="118" REF="010800_0060_0F81D15071AD8B68">and took the care of the church of Ephe&s;us; and upon the invitation of the neighbouring <HI>churches, who had en|joyed only the mini&s;try of pre&s;byters and deacons,</HI> he went to them, and con&s;ecrated bi&s;hops,</Q> &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. L's def. p. 49.50.</NOTE> I have carefully examined the pa&s;&s;age in Eu&s;ebius, Mr. L. refers to; but find it very different from what he has quoted. None of the words, &s;et down in italics, are to be found in the ori|ginal. The pa&s;&s;age truly rendered, is as follows. Speak|ing of John, he &s;ays.&mdash; <Q>After the tyrant's death, he return|ed to Ephe&s;us; and being invited &s;o to do, went al&s;o among the neighbouring nations, where he appointed bi|&s;hops, e&s;tabli&s;hed regular and compleat churches, elect|ing to the clerical office whom&s;oever the Holy Gho&s;t pointed out for the &s;ame.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. eccl. hi&s;t. Lib, III. cap. 23.</NOTE> Tho' I will not charge Mr. L. with di&s;hone&s;ty, in thus pretending to quote from Eu|&s;ebius, what is not to be found in him; &s;ince 'tis po&s;&s;ible he might not have <HI>lei&s;ure to con&s;ult the original,</HI> but taking the tran&s;lation upon tru&s;t, &s;et down the pa&s;&s;age as he found it, in &s;ome epi&s;copal writer; yet every one mu&s;t &s;ee, the words added, in Mr. L's quotation, intirely alter the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, and make it evident it was done, by <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> to favour epi&s;copacy, and impo&s;e upon the unlearned reader. With the addition of the words.&mdash; <Q>who had enjoyed only the mini&s;try of pre&s;byters and deacons;</Q> the pa&s;&s;age does indeed <HI>&s;eem</HI> to favour the doctrine of three orders in the mi|ni&s;try: but let it be read without this corrupt addition, and then let the intelligent reader judge, what it is to Mr. L's purpo&s;e; or whether any other eight lines, taken at random, from Eu&s;ebius, or any other author, will not as effectually prove epi&s;copacy, as the&s;e here quoted? Striped of this addition the pa&s;&s;age mentions but one officer, viz. a bi&s;hop in the&s;e churches; and as that, in &s;cripture, means the &s;ame as pre&s;byter, by his own conce&s;&s;ion, it can be no|thing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS next quotation is from Irenaeus, <Q>That Polycarp was con&s;tituted by the apo&s;tles in A&s;ia, <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> of the church at Smyrna.</Q> An&s;wer. St. Paul, who&s;e authority is at lea&s;t equal to that of Irenaeus tells us, <Q>that the Holy Gho&s;t
<PB N="119" REF="010800_0060_0F81D15071AD8B68">con&s;tituted the elders of Ephe&s;us, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of the church of Ephe&s;us.</Q> If therefore Polycarp's being called bi&s;hop, proves him &s;uch in Mr. L's &s;en&s;e of the word; the&s;e elders mu&s;t be &s;o too. But then what becomes of his main argu|ment for prelacy, from Timothy's being bi&s;hop of Ephe|&s;us? Or if he &s;till denies the&s;e elders to be bi&s;hops, tho' they are called &s;o, the &s;ame he mu&s;t do as to Polycarps. And &s;o this <HI>extract</HI> fails him al&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT he tells us, the de&s;ign of Irenaeus was to prove a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of apo&s;tolic doctrines, <Q>but his argument is e|qually good in favour of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops.</Q> And this, he &s;ays, will prove <Q>that bi&s;hops were &s;uperior to pre&s;byters.</Q> An&s;wer. Not till he proves there were, be&s;ides the&s;e here called bi&s;hops, any pre&s;byters in that church for them "to be &s;uperior to. Irenaeus, in the pa&s;|&s;age quoted, mentions but one order only. This <HI>extract</HI> therefore, is &s;o far from helping Mr. L's &s;cheme of three orders, that it is wholly in favour of our's which has but one.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame an&s;wer al&s;o will &s;erve, for his three next <HI>ex|tracts</HI> from Irenaeus. As there is no mention made in ei|ther of them, of more than one order, viz. bi&s;hops, nor the lea&s;t hint given concerning any other; it mu&s;t be pre|&s;umed that Irenaeus knew of none, but &s;uch bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters as are mentioned in &s;cripture. Con&s;equently that the doctrine of three orders, and Mr. L's dioce&s;an bi|&s;hop, was a &s;tranger in the time in which this father lived: I &s;hall only ju&s;t add. That Mr. L's <HI>tran&s;lator,</HI> has again &s;erved him ill. For in the fir&s;t of the&s;e quotations the words of Irenaeus, as recited by Eu&s;ebius, are not <Q>that Clement is he of whom mention is made Philip: iv. 3. as Mr. L. has it, but "that Linus is he, of whom Paul makes mention in his epi&s;tle to Timothy.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. eccl.

<P>HIS next <HI>extract</HI> is from Jerom. <Q>Quid facit, except&agrave; or|dinatione, epi&s;copus, quod pre&s;byter non facit?" "What can a bi&s;hop do, except ordination, that a pre&s;byter may not do?</Q> Had Mr. L. an&s;wered this que&s;tion, accor|ding to his own principles, the reader would, at once, have &s;een, how very little it was to his purpo&s;e.

Mr. L's bi&s;hop can confirm,&mdash;hold &s;piritual courts, exerci&s;e di&s;cipline, &amp;c. But is a pre&s;byter allowed to do tho&s;e? Nothing le&s;s. But Jerom does not even in|&s;inuate, that <HI>ordination</HI> belongs only to the bi&s;hop, by <HI>di|vine right.</HI> And had Mr. L. read the epi&s;tle, from whence the&s;e words are taken, he mu&s;t have &s;een, that the whole &s;cope of it is to prove, that in the apo&s;tles times, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter were the &s;ame, both in name and office. This he a&s;&s;erts, in &s;o many words, and proves it from the &s;ame texts and topics, as are u&s;ed by pre&s;byterians at this day; and then goes on to &s;hew, how, when, and upon what occa&s;ion the government of the church was altered after|wards. <Q>That one was afterwards cho&s;en, who &s;hould be &s;et over the re&s;t, he tells us, was done as a remedy again&s;t &s;chi&s;m.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hieron.

'Tis pity Mr. L. will not be at the pains of reading the fathers <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> It might, perhaps, &s;ave his friends many a blu&s;h upon his account.</P>
<P>THE next church he mentions, as upon the epi&s;copal model, is that of Antioch. <Q>In this, he tells us, was a num|ber of believers, whom the apo&s;tles, Paul and Barnabas, took the government of for &s;ome time.</Q> Strange! Two bi&s;hops in one church at once! How different the <HI>modern</HI> epi&s;copacy from the <HI>ancient!</HI> Formerly one church could boa&s;t two bi&s;hops, and both apo&s;tles. But their <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</HI> it &s;eems, have made &s;uch improvement in the prelatic art, that one bi&s;hop now will &s;erve for more than an hundred. This mu&s;t be ancient epi&s;copacy inverted. However, this was not the ca&s;e long. <Q>Paul and Barnabas, he &s;ays, were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by Peter.</Q> What, Peter bi&s;hop of Anti|och!

<P>AS to the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to Ignatius, Mr. L. mu&s;t know, if he has read Dr. Chauncy's &s;ermon, that they lie under very &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of forgery, or at lea&s;t of great adulteration and corruption. This the Dr. largely &s;hews in his appendix, and offers &s;uch arguments in &s;upport of the charge, as makes it, at lea&s;t very highly probable, if not cer|tain this was the ca&s;e. The&s;e, Mr. L. does not attempt to an&s;wer. He indeed tells us. <Q>that bi&s;hops Beveridge and Pear&s;on have fully confuted, Me&s;&s;rs. Daille, L'arroque, and all others, in whatever they have advanced again&s;t the&s;e epi&s;tles." And I can tell him "that L'arroque un|dertook to an&s;wer Beveridge and Pear&s;on, as appears by a manu&s;cript found among his papers, in which he had made great progre&s;s; but at the <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of &s;everal per&s;ons, who <HI>leaned too much to the epi&s;copal cau&s;e,</HI> he did not fini&s;h this reply.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Nov.

<P>BUT if we &s;hould allow the&s;e epi&s;tles to be genuine, they will really make nothing in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, but much again&s;t it. 'Tis true, they frequently mention bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons: But then it is equally true, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e epi&s;tles, was e&s;&s;en|tially different from the dioce&s;an one. The <Q>Ignatian bi|&s;hop</Q> pre&s;ided over but one &s;ingle church, was therefore no more than a congregational bi&s;hop, or pa&s;tor of a parti|cular church: Whereas the dioce&s;an one, pre&s;ides over many &s;cores or hundreds of congregations. Again, the former had much the &s;ame authority over his pre&s;byters, as the rector of a pari&s;h, in the church of England, has over his a&s;&s;i&s;tant curates, who are not pretended to be of a dif|ferent order, but have <HI>radically</HI> the &s;ame power with the rec|tor: But the church of England bi&s;hop, is a&s;&s;erted to be a different order from the pre&s;byter; by divine right, &s;upe|rior

<P>AGAIN.

There, one bi&s;hop has many &s;cores or hundreds of communion tables in his dioce&s;e, and a great many thou&s;and communicants; for whom it would be ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, to attend the communion at one table, with their bi&s;hop, and receive the con&s;ecrated elements, at his hands, or in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the Ignatian bi&s;hop took care, in per&s;on, of all the poor of his dioce&s;e; which plainly &s;hews it was but a &s;ingle congregation he pre&s;ided over. Thus Polycarp, bi&s;hop of Smyrna, is commanded to do. <Q>Let not the widows be neglected: Be thou, next to the Lord, their guardian. Let nothing be done without thy will.

<P>I MIGHT ea&s;ily fill &s;everal pages with extracts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But the&s;e are abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e epi&s;tles, was not, could not be a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, but only a pa&s;tor of a &s;ingle con|gregation, agreeable to the practice in our churches. And notwith&s;tanding all the bu&s;tle made, with the&s;e epi&s;tles, by epi&s;copalians; &s;hould the epi&s;copacy de&s;cribed in them, once take place; it would be as certainly ruinous and de|&s;tructive, to the <HI>engli&s;h hierarchy,</HI> as that contained in the &s;criptures, and practi&s;ed in our churches, would be. Then there would be no longer, any of tho&s;e large and over|grown bi&s;hopricks, &s;o much, and &s;o ju&s;tly complained of, even by epi&s;copalians them&s;elves, containing &s;ome hundreds of churches and congregations, with but one &s;ingle pa&s;tor to watch over, to in&s;pect, and govern the whole: But eve|ry congregation, every church, would have its own parti|cular pa&s;tor for the&s;e important purpo&s;es; as the pre&s;by|terians actually have. Hence it will follow; that the e|pi&s;copal ordinations at this day, are by no means the epi&s;|copal ordinations of the Ignatian age, being performed by a &s;ort of bi&s;hops, unknown at that time, and who&s;e autho|rity is incon&s;i&s;tent with, and de&s;tructive of, that of the Ig|natian
<PB N="124" REF="010800_0063_0F81D152AD9134F8">bi&s;hop: Whereas, the ordinations, called pre&s;byte|rian, are truly <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> ones, in the language of Ignatius. They are performed by &s;uch pari&s;h-pa&s;tors, as Ignatius's bi&s;hops were; having the &s;ame charge, the &s;ame office, and power, as his had. And therefore, to pre&s;s Ignatius into the cau&s;e of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, and argue from the bi|&s;hop's power, as de&s;cribed by him, in &s;upport of that which modern bi&s;hops claim, is but to impo&s;e upon the reader, by mere &s;ounds in&s;tead of arguments.</P>
<P>WHOEVER would &s;ee more upon this argument, I would recommend to them the peru&s;al of Mr. Boy&s;e's <Q>clear ac|count of the ancient epi&s;copacy," and, "an enquiry into the con&s;titution, di&s;cipline, unity and wor&s;hip of the pri|mitive church,</Q> &s;aid to be wrote by Sir Peter King. The&s;e authors, e&s;pecially the former, have collected every thing from Ignatius, relative to the &s;ubject, and clearly &s;hewn, that the Ignatian bi&s;hop was but a pa&s;tor of a &s;in|gle congregation, and therefore can afford no countenance or &s;upport to modern epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>OUR author next mentions Clemens Alexandrinus, as declaring in favour of his &s;cheme:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 56.</NOTE> But as he u&s;es, not Clement's words, but his own, and refers to no particular place for what he advances; it may be &s;ufficient to tell him, that when he does this, it will be then time enough to an|&s;wer him.</P>
<P>HIS next voucher is Clemens Romanus. He is made to &s;ay, <Q>To the high prie&s;t, his proper offices were appoint|ed; the prie&s;ts had their proper order, and the levites their peculiar &s;ervices, or <HI>deacon&s;hips.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I grant there are words to this purpo&s;e, in Clement's e|pi&s;tle to the Corinthians: But that <Q>he applies the&s;e words, as Mr. L. &s;ays, to the orders in the chri&s;tian church,</Q> I utterly deny. I have carefully examined every thing in this epi&s;tle, as to this point, and can find nothing that looks like &s;uch "an application?" And I challenge Mr. L. or any one el&s;e to point it out. As Mr. Pierce ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, <Q>there are no &s;igns of eccle&s;ia&s;tical monarchy, to be found in Clement. A pre&s;byterian can hardly de|&s;cribe

In his commentary upon Titus,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Tom. 9. p. 103</NOTE> having declared, <Q>that pre&s;byter is the &s;ame with bi&s;hop, that, according to &s;cripture, one is the name of age, the other of office;</Q>. and largely proved, from the &s;ame texts and arguments, as are u&s;ed by pre&s;byterians, that in the times of the apo&s;tles, <Q>the care of the church was equally divided among many, being governed by the common council of pre&s;byters;" he adds: "The&s;e things are alledged that we might &s;hew, that among the antients, the <HI>pre&s;byters were the &s;ame with the bi&s;hops,</HI> but by little and little, the whole care was devolved on one, that the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;ention might be plucked up.

To confute this notion, he largely proves from &s;cripture, that a pre&s;byter is &s;o far from being inferior to a deacon, that on the contrary, he is really equal to a bi&s;hop, being the &s;ame office, according to &s;cripture account. Whereupon he immediately adds the words quoted by Mr. L. Now can it once be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a man of Jerom's good &s;en&s;e, after he had been prov|ing the pre&s;byter's &s;uperiority to a deacon, by &s;hewing that he was <HI>equal</HI> to, and in fact, a bi&s;hop, &s;hould immediately be guilty of &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency, as to a&s;&s;ert a bi&s;hop to be <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to a pre&s;byter, as Mr. L. by his quotation would make him to do? 'Tis ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e it. <Q>The plain meaning of Jerom, (as Dr. Stillingfleet ob&s;erves,) is no more than this. "That as Aaron and his &s;ons, in the order of prie&s;thood, were above the levites, under the law; &s;o bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, (which are with him the &s;ame,) in the order of the evangelical prie&s;thood, are a|bove the deacons, under the go&s;pel: For the compari|&s;on runs, not between Aaron and his &s;ons under the law, and bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters under the go&s;pel; but between Aaron and his &s;ons, as one part of the compari&s;on, under the law, and the levites under them, as the other; &s;o un|der the go&s;pel, bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters make one part of the compari&s;on, an&s;wering to Aaron and his &s;ons, in that wherein they all agree, viz. the order of prie&s;thood; and the other part, under the go&s;pel, is that of deacons, an|&s;wering to the levites under the law.</Q> This interpreta|tion of Jerom's words, will make him con&s;i&s;tent; whereas that of our author, makes him flatly contradict him&s;elf; and &s;o cannot be admitted.</P>

IT would be ea&s;y to fill many pages, with extracts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from the&s;e and other ancient fathers, as Ori|gen, Clemens Alexandrinus, Cyprian, the apo&s;tolic con&s;ti|tutions and canons, &amp;c. But the&s;e, I tru&s;t, are abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, was a thing unknown in the&s;e ages: That the more early writers, make no di&s;tinction at all between bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, but u&s;e the names promi&s;cuou&s;ly, to &s;ignify the &s;ame office, ju&s;t as the &s;criptures do. And even in the later ones, where &s;ome di&s;tinction appears, it was no greater than that between the rector of a pari&s;h, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant curates, who are yet of the &s;ame order; con&s;equently, that there is no foundation for dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, &s;uch as our author pleads for, to be found in any of the&s;e writers: Modern epi&s;copacy was an utter &s;tranger to the&s;e times.</P>
<P>MR.

I &s;hall adduce a few more in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>IN the church of Alexandria, it appears from Jerom, that pre&s;byters actually <HI>ordained,</HI> for two hundred years, from the fir&s;t planting of it. His words are,&mdash; <Q>At Alexandria, from Mark the evangeli&s;t, to Heraclas and Diony&s;ius, the bi&s;hop thereof, the <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> always named one, cho|&s;en out of them, and <HI>placed</HI> in an higher degree, their bi&s;hop: As if an army &s;hould <HI>make</HI> an emperor, or the deacons &s;hould choo&s;e one of them&s;elves, whom they knew to be mo&s;t diligent, and call him <HI>arch-deacon.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hieron. epi&s;t. ad Evagr. tom. ii. p. 109.</NOTE> Hence it appears, that the bi&s;hop of Alexandria, was no more than a <HI>prime-pre&s;byter,</HI> of the &s;ame office with the re&s;t: No more than an <HI>arch-deacon,</HI> of the &s;ame office with his brother-deacons; and that even this was confered, not by con&s;ecration, from the hands of a &s;uperior order, but by the pre&s;byters them&s;elves, who cho&s;e and appointed him thereto. If pre&s;byters therefore could appoint and con&s;ecrate their
<PB N="131" REF="010800_0066_0F81D158B308B280">bi&s;hop, I hope it will be allowed that they had power to ordain a brother-pre&s;byter; con&s;equently that <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> ordination was the original e&s;tabli&s;hment there.</P>
<P>THAT the ancient Gallic or French church was pre&s;by|terian, appears from what I have already quoted from Ire|naeus, pa&s;tor of the church of Lyons in France. With him, pre&s;byter and bi&s;hop are the &s;ame office, as they are al&s;o in &s;cripture. And, (as Dr. Stillingfleet ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,) <Q>he attributes, both the <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> he pleads for, and the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> thro' which it de&s;cended from the apo&s;tles in|tirely to the order of <HI>pre&s;byters,</HI> and none other.</Q></P>
<P>THE Iri&s;h church al&s;o, in the early times of it, was evi|dently <HI>pre&s;byterian.</HI> Certainly it was not epi&s;copalian, of the <HI>dicce&s;an</HI> kind. Nennius mentions St. Patrick's ordain|ing 365 bi&s;hops in that church, in the early times of it. And Mr. Clark&s;on &s;hews out of Bernard, and Baronius, that there were, in that kingdom, well nigh as many bi|&s;hops as churches.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">prim. epi&s;co. p. 40.</NOTE> The&s;e certainly could not be bi&s;hops of the dioce&s;an kind, who have many &s;cores or hundreds of churches in their cure; but were evidently congregational pa&s;tors of particular churches, like ours at this day.</P>
<P>MR.

<P>THAT the church of Scotland, was originally pre&s;byte|rian, is proved by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es. Pro&s;per Aquita|nicus, in his chronicle, annexed to that of Eu&s;ebius, tells us, <Q>that Palladius was ordained, by pope Caele&s;tine, for the Scots, <HI>that had already believed in Chri&s;t,</HI> and is &s;ent to them to be their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> bi&s;hop.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;. chron. ad ann. 429.

<P>IN the mean time, I am at a lo&s;s to know what he means by &s;aying, <Q>that <HI>pre&s;bytery</HI> was introduced into Scotland, at the time of the reformation, by <HI>rebellion,</HI></Q> unle&s;s he thinks it mu&s;t needs be rebellion, for &s;ubjects to be chri&s;|tians or prote&s;tants, who are &s;o unhappy, as to have a pa|gan or papi&s;t for their prince: But if &s;o the greate&s;t part of the engli&s;h nation, epi&s;copalians not excepted, were guil|ty of rebellion, at the glorious revolution.

<P>MR. L. &s;eems to be &s;ure that epi&s;copacy was the original con&s;titution in England. If it was, I am &s;ure nothing he has &s;aid proves it to be &s;o. The authorities he has brought are by no means &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. In the fir&s;t place, they a&s;&s;ert no &s;uch thing in the quotations he has made from them. They only mention that this church had bi&s;hops; but whether dioce&s;an ones, or only &s;criptural
<PB N="134" REF="010800_0068_0F81D15AC0EEBD30">bi&s;hops, congregational pa&s;tors, they are wholly &s;ilent. Be|&s;ides, they are te&s;timonies &s;ome ten or twelve hundred years to late, to be depended upon, as authentic vouchers in this ca&s;e. If St. Paul planted chri&s;tianity in England, as many &s;uppo&s;e, 'tis natural to &s;uppo&s;e that he would &s;ettle the &s;ame form of ordination, he him&s;elf had received, and this has been proved to be <HI>pre&s;byterian.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus attended our author, in his &s;earch after epi&s;copacy among the writings of the fathers,&mdash;having par|ticularly examined all his <HI>extracts,</HI> from them, and exhibit|ed a number more from the &s;ame writings, in &s;upport of the contrary opinion; I now freely &s;ubmit the whole <Q>to the cool and candid</Q> to determine whether they are of &s;o much "weight in his favour" as he &s;eems to "per&s;uade" him&s;elf they are. The impartial reader will now judge, whether Mr. L. has been able to find any more &s;olid foun|dation, on which to erect his grand fabric of dioce&s;an epi&s;|copacy, among the writings of the fathers, than what ap|pears in the new-te&s;tament; con&s;equently what little rea|&s;on he had, to be &s;o very confident of having fully &s;ettled the di&s;pute in his favour, by an appeal to the&s;e writers, and that even before he had fini&s;hed his extracts from them.</P>
<P>UPON quiting his favourite Ignatius, he has the&s;e words. <Q>But is not this fact evident and undeniable, from the forecited pa&s;&s;ages, that in the next age after the apo&s;tles, epi&s;copacy was univer&s;ally received, in all the churches of Chri&s;t?</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 53, 54.</NOTE> What now, I a&s;k, are the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from whence <HI>this fact</HI> is &s;o undeniably evident? Why barely one or two quotations, from the pretended epi&s;tles of Ignatius, without having, as yet, given the lea&s;t intimation, that the&s;e epi&s;tles lay under any &s;u&s;picion of interpolation, adul|teration or forgery, and without afterwards examining, or attempting to invalidate, any of the arguments brought by Dr. Chauncy, to prove their in&s;ufficiency, in point of evi|dence, on that account. Be&s;ides the&s;e, Mr. L. had, as yet, brought no te&s;timonies from any writer, within two hun|dred years after Chri&s;t, except from Irenaeus only; and the&s;e barely &s;ome &s;craps, detached from their connection,
<PB N="135" REF="010800_0068_0F81D15AC0EEBD30">and which even then, favour his cau&s;e in &s;ound only, not in &s;en&s;e; as has, I tru&s;t, &s;ufficiently appeared, from the foregoing remarks. And yet this is the whole evidence, on which he affirms it <Q>to be <HI>undeniable fact,</HI> that epi&s;co|pacy, in his &s;en&s;e of the word, was <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> received, in all the churches of Chri&s;t.</Q> What may not one make to be <HI>fact,</HI> and <HI>undeniably</HI> &s;o, upon &s;uch evidence as this? Much to be pitied is the man, who is &s;o far under the go|vernment of prejudice, as to imagine &s;uch evidence as this undeniable! Much more, if his prejudice puts him upon repre&s;enting that as <HI>undeniable evidence</HI> to others, which is truly no evidence at all!</P>
<P>HE goes on &mdash; <Q>Tho' this &s;trangely &s;lipt Dr. Chauncy's ob&s;ervation, when he read the fathers, yet I &s;uppo&s;e their te&s;timony may be of &s;ome weight, with tho&s;e who&s;e ob|&s;ervation this point has not &s;lipt.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 54.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. Dr. Chauncy never &s;o much as hinted that this <HI>fact</HI> had &s;lipt his ob&s;ervation. He well knew that no &s;uch <HI>fact</HI> ever took place within that term of time, and &s;o mu&s;t every one el&s;e, who impartially reads the fathers. What the Dr. refered to, when he &s;aid, <Q>unle&s;s it had &s;lipt his ob&s;ervation," was this, "that the mode of diction," bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons,</Q> was not to be met with, till we come to Clement of Alexandria, who flouri&s;h|ed towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century. If Mr. L. will be plea&s;ed to point out an in&s;tance, the Dr. no doubt, will readily own "it &s;lipt his ob&s;ervation." 'Till then, he will have ju&s;t occa&s;ion for blu&s;hing, whenever he reflects, how gro&s;sly he has perverted the Dr's words.</P>
<P>MR. L. &s;ays, <Q>he is &s;urprized that the Dr. &s;hould deny, that the ancients con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ert the government of the church, to have been epi&s;copal all along from the times of the apo&s;tles, without producing a &s;entence from one of the fathers, to &s;upport his denial.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 60.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONE would thought, a man who engages in a public controver&s;y, ought to be &s;o well acquainted with the rules of di&s;putation, as to know, that it belongs to tho&s;e who <HI>affirm</HI> a fact, to bring evidence in proof of it; not to tho&s;e
<PB N="136" REF="010800_0069_0F81D15B35B88870">who <HI>deny</HI> it. This was the ca&s;e here. Dr. Hoadly <HI>affirm|ed</HI> a certain fact to be declared in the fathers. Dr. Chauncy <HI>denies</HI> they mention any &s;uch fact. This he has a right to do, without <HI>proving &s;uch denial.</HI> The proof lay upon the affirmer. It lies upon all the advocates of epi&s;copacy in this in&s;tance. It has often been called for: But the call has never yet been an&s;wered, by producing &s;o much as a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, within two hundred years after Chri&s;t, except from the ju&s;tly di&s;puted epi&s;tles of Ignatius, wherein this fact is affirmed, either in direct terms, or in words from whence it can be fairly deduced. 'Till this is done, Dr. Chauncy, and all mankind have a right to deny the fact. Had Mr. L. thought of this, it might have &s;aved him his great "&s;urprize."</P>
<P>HE adds.&mdash;<Q>In&s;tead of &s;upporting this denial from the fathers, the Dr. has quoted the opinion of the moderns.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p 60</NOTE> Mr. L. is quite mi&s;taken in the de&s;ign of the&s;e quotations. They were bro't only to &s;hew, that in the ages po&s;terior to the &s;econd century, and even after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of e|pi&s;copacy, it was far from being indubitably clear, that this e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the practice upon it, had taken place upon the foot of a <HI>divine right.</HI> And in this view there are none, I imagine, &s;ave Mr. L. and his party, but what will think them pertinent and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to the Dr's demand <Q>of an example of epi&s;|copal ordination within the two fir&s;t centuries,</Q> Mr. L. in&s;tances in the "ordination of Titus by St. Paul."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 61.</NOTE> But pray how came he by the knowledge that Paul ordained Titus? He affirms it, and that is all. If he had any proof, why did he not produce it? Sure I am, the &s;cripture affords him none. But if it did, how will this prove he did it in the <HI>capacity</HI> of a bi&s;hop?

But if he was, how does this prove that he him&s;elf received epi&s;copal ordination? This, if I under|&s;tand it, is Mr. L's argument: Titus him&s;elf was a bi&s;hop; therefore he was ordained by one, or had epi&s;copal ordina|tion. But how does this follow? Paul and Timothy, he allows, were bi&s;hops: And yet, it has been proved, and that from &s;cripture, that they were both ordained by pre&s;|byters. And from Jerom it appears, that he whom they called bi&s;hop, in the church of Alexandria, was cho&s;en from among, and &s;et apart to his epi&s;copal office by the pre&s;by|ters of that church, for two hundred years, in the begin|ning of it.</P>
<P>AN example of epi&s;copal ordination, not from &s;cripture, but from the fathers of the two fir&s;t centuries, was what was demanded. Mr. L. &s;ays he could produce many. Why has he not then done it? Was it for want of incli|nation, or ability? Doubtle&s;s the latter. Thus after all his boa&s;ted appeal to the fathers, they afford him as little relief, as the &s;criptures do.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> Examination of Mr. L's appeal to the fir&s;t reformers for his divine right of epi&s;copacy, <HI>from p. 61, to 65.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN both the pieces Mr. L. undertook to an&s;wer, it was ob&s;erved, that this doctrine <Q>of the unalterable divine right of epi&s;copacy,</Q> was a &s;tranger to the fir&s;t refor|mers,
<PB N="138" REF="010800_0070_0F81D15BED43C4C0">even in the church of England. This was done with a view to expo&s;e the bigotry of tho&s;e anathematizing zea|lots, the modern &s;ons of that church, who, like Mr. L. un|church and unchri&s;tianize all the prote&s;tant world but them|&s;elves. Sundry te&s;timonies were adduced, from the fir&s;t reformers and later writers of the church of England, both bi&s;hops and others, to prove that this was not the doctrine of that church, at the time of the reformation, and many years after.&mdash;That tho' for <HI>rea&s;ons of &s;tate,</HI> they concurred with the epi&s;copal &s;ettlement in England; yet they did not look upon it to be of divine right, or &s;o e&s;&s;ential as to nul|lify all ordinations, unle&s;s tho&s;e performed by bi&s;hops, in their &s;en&s;e of the word. And it was particularly &s;hewed, that the fir&s;t who publicly maintained that uncharitable antichri&s;tian doctrine was the famous arch-bi&s;hop Laud, of papi&s;tical and per&s;ecuting memory; and that he was pub|licly rebuked by his &s;uperior for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>MR. L. declares him&s;elf of the &s;ame principles, and un|dertakes to defend them, by an appeal to the fir&s;t refor|mers. Let us examine his proofs.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t is from arch-bi&s;hop Cranmer, in the&s;e words, <Q>We read not that any, not being a bi&s;hop, hath, &s;ince the beginning of Chri&s;t's church, ordained a prie&s;t.</Q> If by bi&s;hop, is here meant, a congregational bi&s;hop, all pre&s;byterians will agree, that none but &s;uch have power to ordain: But then it will be nothing to Mr. L's purpo&s;e.&mdash;But if a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop is intended, then all that Cran|mer can be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean is, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordaining has been confined to &s;uch bi&s;hops, not as &s;olely ve&s;ted with that power by the law of Chri&s;t; but only by human ap|pointment, and the cu&s;tom of the church. For bi&s;hop Burnet a&s;&s;ures us, that Cranmer's opinion was, <Q>That bi|&s;hops and prie&s;ts, were at one time, and were not two things, but one office, in the beginning of Chri&s;t's religi|on.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Refor. Vol. i. collec. p. 223.</NOTE> If they had one office, they had one and the &s;ame power: All therefore that Cranmer intends is, that this work of ordination, which was originally common, had been, by the cu&s;tom of the church, appropriated to bi&s;hops.
<PB N="139" REF="010800_0070_0F81D15BED43C4C0">This interpretation makes Cranmer con&s;i&s;tent, whereas Mr. L's involves him in a plain contradiction.</P>
<P>HIS next <HI>extract</HI> is from bi&s;hop Jewel, in the&s;e words, <Q>We believe that there be divers degrees of mini&s;ters in the church, whereof &s;ome be deacons, &s;ome prie&s;ts, &s;ome bi&s;hops.</Q> That Jewel here only a&s;&s;erts a matter of fact, or what were the officers then in the church, not a matter of right, or what ought to be by divine in&s;titution, is evi|dent from what he &s;ays in his apology. Speaking of the various degrees of clergy in Jerom's time, he &s;ays; <Q>Chri&s;t appointed not the&s;e di&s;tinctions of orders from the be|ginning.&mdash;This is the thing <HI>we defend,</HI> St. Jerom &s;aith, let bi&s;hops under&s;tand, they are in authority over prie&s;ts, more by cu&s;tom, than by order of God's truth. a prie&s;t is the &s;ame with a bi&s;hop; they are both one thing, and the churches were at fir&s;t, governed by the common advice of the prie&s;ts.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apol. part. 2 c. 3.</NOTE> This plainly &s;hews, that in the pa&s;&s;age quoted by Mr. L. he does not mean to declare his <HI>belief</HI> of the <HI>divine right</HI> of three orders; but only to a&s;&s;ert a matter of fact; and &s;o is no proof that Jewel owned the divine right of epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, this is proved to be the doctrine of the reformers, from the preface to the book of ordination. <Q>It is evident to all men diligently reading the holy &s;crip|tures, &amp;c.&mdash;that there have been the&s;e <HI>three</HI> orders of mi|ni&s;ters, &amp;c."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 63.</NOTE> Upon which he ob&s;erves. "It mu&s;t be evident to any man of common &s;en&s;e, that the reformers, who compo&s;ed this preface, believed the three offices of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons, to be of divine right, or none of them to be &s;o; for they as po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert that all are, as that one is.</Q>&mdash;An&s;wer. They do not a&s;&s;ert that one is. This preface only a&s;&s;erts a matter of fact; that there had been &s;uch orders from the apo&s;tles times. It does not declare that the&s;e three orders are of divine unal|terable right: Nor does it determine what kind of bi&s;hops were from the apo&s;tles times, whether dioce&s;an, or only parochial. And if Me&s;&s;rs. Hoadly and Ollyffe, two epi&s;|copal divines, may be allowed to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="140" REF="010800_0071_0F81D15C6C7B63E0">this a&s;&s;ertion, as well as Mr. L. it will be nothing to his purpo&s;e. Mr. Ollyffe in his an&s;wer to Mr. Calamy, &s;peak|ing of this very preface, &s;ays, <Q>The propo&s;ition of this rubrick is formed or expre&s;&s;ed, with as great a degree of latitude or moderation, as ever could be expected, from an epi&s;copal church. <HI>It &s;aith nothing of divine right or appointment.</HI> That is Mr. Calamy's addition, as Mr. Hoadly well ob&s;erves. It &s;aith nothing of the di&s;tincti|on of their powers and officers; or whether they have been every where in every church or no: But only, that from the apo&s;tles times, there have been the&s;e orders, &amp;c. From which, the mo&s;t that can be inferred is, that in &s;uch churches where there has been need of them, or oc|ca&s;ion for them all, there have been three &s;uch ranks of mini&s;ters, for the government and in&s;truction of Chri&s;t's church, from the times of the apo&s;tles; which yet by Mr. Calamy's leave, <HI>does not prove a divine appointment</HI> of all, (however otherwi&s;e it may appear to him,) there ha|ving been other things, in the apo&s;tles days, which yet, for all that, are not allowed to be of divine appointment</Q> Here we &s;ee Mr. L's uncharitable interpretation of this preface, as tho' it meant to nullify all ordinations, &s;ave tho&s;e of the epi&s;copal kind, &s;tands expre&s;sly condemned, by two celebrated divines of his own church. As their interpre|tation is more charitable and chri&s;tian-like, than Mr. L's; I pre&s;ume every per&s;on of candor will judge it the true one; and con&s;equently, that his argument, founded on &s;uch a &s;tingy interpretation, can't be admitted as proof, that the venerable compilers of this preface, were of his contracted and &s;chi&s;matical principles.</P>
<P>THO' they here &s;peak of three orders in the church, yet they no where &s;ay, that bi&s;hops are by divine right, &s;upe|rior to pre&s;byters: Nor is there the lea&s;t intimation, that they looked upon all ordinations to be null and void, unle&s;s performed by a bi&s;hop. For tho' they &s;ay <Q>no man &s;hall be accounted a lawful bi&s;hop, unle&s;s admitted according to the form there pre&s;cribed;</Q> yet this is expre&s;sly li|mitted <HI>"to that church of England."</HI> All therefore that can
<PB N="141" REF="010800_0071_0F81D15C6C7B63E0">be meant by this, is no more than a declaration, who they will allow to be accounted <HI>lawful bi&s;hops of the national church of England:</HI> But this is no proof that they believed the divine right and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of dioce&s;an epi&s;co|pacy, or accounted tho&s;e churches to have no valid mini|&s;try and ordinances, that are without it, as Mr. L. does. The contrary of this, is undeniably evident from their practice, as I &s;hall &s;hew.</P>
<P>OUR author's la&s;t argument, to prove that the <HI>reformers</HI> were of his uncharitable &s;entiments, in this point, is taken from the 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, canons of their church, which he has quoted at large.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 63, 64, 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS the canons of the church of England, as they now &s;tand, were compo&s;ed at &s;undry times; at periods far di&s;|tant one from another; &s;ome in the reign of Q Eli&s;abeth, &s;ome in that of K. James, &amp;c; Mr. L. &s;hould have told us which cla&s;s, tho&s;e he has quoted belonged to: For if they were among the number of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ed in K. James's reign; they can't be &s;aid to exhibit the &s;entiments of the <HI>fir&s;t re|formers,</HI> who had no hand in making them, being dead many years before. As he has not &s;een fit to do this, I might ju&s;tly forbear any further notice of them, as being nothing to the purpo&s;e of his argument.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, allowing they were of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, they will by no means prove, that the compilers of them believed the unalterable divine right of epi&s;copacy, and denied the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination. The &s;ub&s;tance of them is, (for they are too long to tran&s;cribe) <Q>that if any per&s;on &s;hould deny the church of England to be a true church, or declare her government by bi&s;hops, &amp;c. to be anti|chri&s;tian, or repugnant to the word of God, or upon that account, or any other, &s;eperate him&s;elf from her commu|nion, he &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommunicated.</Q> But now there is nothing in the&s;e canons, that will prove the au|thors of them believed dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, to be of unal|terable divine right. They might think it to be <HI>lawful,</HI> tho' not expre&s;sly of <HI>divine in&s;titution;</HI> much le&s;s that it was <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the being of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="010800_0072_0F81D15F6DA155E0">
AS to the <HI>charity</HI> of &s;uch excommunicating, anathema|tizing canons, I mu&s;t leave it to the vindication of Mr. L. and tho&s;e of his &s;tamp: For as to my&s;elf, I utterly de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding in any attempt of that kind. Americans, ble&s;&s;ed be God, have hitherto been unacquainted with &s;uch <HI>damnatory</HI> canons. Their fulminations in this land, are heard, only like the di&s;tant thunders of the <HI>vatican.</HI> Had not Mr. L's zeal for epi&s;copacy, got the better of his pru|dence, I &s;hould have judged he would have been more ten|der of the reputation of his <HI>be&s;t con&s;tituted</HI> church, than thus to expo&s;e her nakedne&s;s, by bringing to view the&s;e <HI>notable</HI> canons, in a country where they are &s;o little known. Per|haps his de&s;ign was to let us know what we are to expect, if the &s;cheme for &s;ending bi&s;hops to America, erecting &s;pi|ritual courts, &amp;c. in the colonies, &s;hould take place.&mdash;</P>
<P>But to return.</P>
<P>THE above remarks, I tru&s;t, make it &s;ufficiently clear, that it cannot be proved, either from the preface to the book of ordination, or from the canons, or indeed from any thing el&s;e Mr. L. has quoted, that the reformers were of his &s;entiments, as to the divine right of epi&s;copacy. They conformed to the epi&s;copal church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king and parliament, as what they thought <HI>lawful,</HI> tho' not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in it &s;elf, or of any &s;criptural or divine appoint|ment. &mdash;That they did not look upon it as of divine in&s;titution, is evident,</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM their <HI>expre&s;s declarations,</HI> both &s;ingly, and in a collective capacity. I have had occa&s;ion already to cite &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from bi&s;hops Cranmer and Jewel, in which they expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert it, as their judgment, <Q>that bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in &s;cripture, is one and the &s;ame.</Q> The bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Therlby, Redman and Cox, declared them|&s;elves of the &s;ame opinion.

<P>THESE things, I mentioned in my &s;ermon, to which Mr. L. has made no reply. I now &s;ubmit it to the candid read|er, whether it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that men who could expre&s;s them&s;elves in this manner, were of Mr. L's princi|ples, <Q>that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of divine right," "and that all ordinations by pre&s;byters, are a mere nullity.</Q></P>
<P>MR. L's letter-writer, S. J. tells us, <Q>the &s;entiments of the fir&s;t reformers, are not to be learnt from &s;ome tran|&s;ient expre&s;&s;ions of individuals, but from their public
<PB N="144" REF="010800_0073_0F81D160251973A8">acts.</Q> I have here produced in&s;tancies of both, in which, as individuals, and as public bodies, they give their te&s;ti|mony for the &s;criptural divine rights of pre&s;byterian ordi|nation and government, in terms, as expre&s;s and po&s;itive, as can well be conceived. From the&s;e te&s;timonies it evidently follows, that epi&s;copacy was not e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, at the time of the reformation, upon the foot of <HI>divine right;</HI> but only as a form of government, &s;uited to the civil in&s;titution of the &s;tate, by which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS fact further appears from the <HI>practice</HI> of the church of England, con&s;equent upon &s;aid e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is not denied that there have been &s;ome particular mem|bers of that church, all along, from the <HI>pontificate</HI> of arch|bi&s;hop Laud, to the pre&s;ent day, who, like Mr. L. have e|&s;pou&s;ed this uncharitable doctrine <HI>of the divine right</HI> of epi&s;|copacy, and the invalidity of all mini&s;terial authority and go&s;pel admini&s;trations, where this is wanting. But that this is not the <HI>doctrine of the church of England,</HI> appears from her repeated practice to the contrary, in admitting mini|&s;ters to officiate in that church, who never had epi&s;copal ordination. In the reign of K. Edward the &s;ixth Mr. Knox was improved by him, as his chaplain, and had the offer of a bi&s;hoprick, tho' he had nothing but pre&s;byterian ordina|tion, and not even that, if Mr. L. &s;ays true. In the &s;ame reign, Peter Martyr, Martin Bucer, and P. Fagius, all fo|reigners, and who had been ordained only by pre&s;byters, had eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments in the church of England confer|red upon them, without re-ordination.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Owen's plea for &s;crip ordina. p. 118.</NOTE> Mr. William Whit|tingham was made dean of Durham about 1563 tho' or|dained by pre&s;byters only.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ibid. p, 121.</NOTE> In like manner, Mr. Travers, ordained by a pre&s;byter beyond &s;ea, was &s;even years lec|turer at the temple, and had the bi&s;hop of London's letter for it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ibid. p. 122.</NOTE> And even &s;o late as the time of K.

<P><PB N="145" REF="010800_0073_0F81D160251973A8">
NOW is it not abundantly evident from the&s;e <HI>facts,</HI> that the church of England, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> is not of Mr. L's principles, as to the point in debate? He a&s;&s;erts the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy, and utterly denies the <HI>validity</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination: But here we &s;ee, the church of England, and her greate&s;t dignitaries and bi&s;hops, not only a&s;&s;erting in words, the <HI>validity</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination; but repeat|edly declaring this, to be the <HI>&s;en&s;e and doctrine</HI> of that church, by admitting, from time to time, tho&s;e who had no other ordination, to the free exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try, and placing them in the highe&s;t offices in the church. Whom now &s;hall we believe? Mr. L. who pretends, from the rubrick and canons of this church, to prove that &s;he holds the un|chri&s;tian, &s;chi&s;matical doctrine afore&s;aid? Or &s;he her&s;elf, who by her practice, denies it?

<P N="3">3.

<P>IN this part of his work, our author pretends to give us &s;undry <HI>extracts</HI> from the foreign prote&s;tants: Not in|deed to prove, that the&s;e foreign churches are of the epi&s;|copal kind. This he knew was impo&s;&s;ible: But tho' they are pre&s;byterians them&s;elves, yet that they do not allow our ordinations to be valid. Now, granting his quotations from Calvin, Beza, Le Mayne, &amp;c. to be genuine; which, con&s;idering the freedom he u&s;es with other authors, is at lea&s;t very doubtful; they will by no means prove that the&s;e men denied the validity of ordination, even among the di&s;&s;enters in England. What they &s;eem to blame the old puritans for, is their &s;eparating from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England, not for maintaining pre&s;byterian prin|ciples. Be&s;ides, it is well known what arts were u&s;ed in them times, by the &s;ticklers for uniformity, to &s;ollicit the opinion of foreign prote&s;tants in their favour, and get them to di&s;countenance the &s;eperation. <Q>About this time, &s;e|veral letters pa&s;&s;ed, between the engli&s;h divines, on both &s;ides, and &s;everal learned foreigners. Matters were fal&s;e|ly repre&s;ented to them, and great arts were u&s;ed, on the <HI>bi&s;hop's</HI> &s;ide, to prevent &s;uch per&s;ons writing, who they found would not write in their behalf; and what they thought made for them, they publi&s;hed to the world in way of triumph. The foreigners were told, that unle&s;s they complied with the things enjoined, they mu&s;t let in the papi&s;ts to &s;upply the cures. Several foreigners there|fore dreading that, and hoping the&s;e things would &s;oon be altered, &s;pake more favourable of them than they de&s;erved.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pierce vind. p. 68.</NOTE> Moreover the&s;e foreign divines knew, that epi&s;copacy was &s;ettled in England, not as of <HI>divine right,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="010800_0075_0F81D161147BB6A0">but only by <HI>civil authority.</HI> Having this view of the engli&s;h hierarchy, they might think it more advi&s;able for their brethren in England, to &s;ubmit to it, than to go into a &s;epa|ration <HI>barely upon this account.</HI> For it is only on account of <HI>this,</HI> that they are, in Mr. L's quotations, &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;e|parate, and for which they are blamed. Whereas this was but one thing, among many, that cau&s;ed the &s;eparation. But what bu&s;ine&s;s had Mr. L. with the di&s;&s;enters in Eng|land? The pieces he attacks, undertook the defence of the New-England mini&s;try, not that of the di&s;&s;enters in Eng|land. There was no need of it. This has been repeatedly and &s;ucce&s;sfully done by many able writers of their own. Particularly by Me&s;&s;rs. Baxter, Calamy, Pierce, and more lately the di&s;&s;enting gentleman in an&s;wer to Mr. White. Be&s;ides, who does he mean by <Q>the di&s;&s;enters in this coun|try?</Q> If he intends New-England; bating a few ana|bapti&s;ts and quakers, I know of no di&s;&s;enters, &s;ave tho&s;e of his communion. Epi&s;copacy never was e&s;tabli&s;hed here, tho' its oppo&s;ite is, to the no &s;mall mortification of our au|thor and company.

<P N="1">1.

<P>NOW can there be a more full and convincing evidence, of the&s;e foreign churches allowing of the validity of our or|dination, than this univer&s;al agreement and te&s;timony of their public con&s;titutions in this point? Mr. L. and tho&s;e of his &s;tamp, tho' they renounce our ordinations, yet allow of tho&s;e performed in the <HI>romi&s;h</HI> church. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the principles of the papi&s;ts, in this re&s;pect, are the &s;ame with theirs. Epi&s;copacy is the doctrine of the church of Rome; the church of England therefore allow their ordinations to be valid, as being the &s;ame with her own. But now, with an evidence beyond exception it ap|pears, that all the foreign prote&s;tants are &s;trictly of our principles, as to the ordaining power; from whence it un|deniably follows, that they mu&s;t allow and approve of our ordinations, as valid, becau&s;e they are the very &s;ame as are pointed out, in all their confe&s;&s;ions of faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS point is al&s;o evident from the univer&s;al <HI>practice</HI> of the foreign churches. All the Dutch churches through|out the united provinces, the prote&s;tant churches in France, tho&s;e of Geneva and the prote&s;tant cantons in Switzerland, &amp;c. are utter &s;trangers to bi&s;hops, both name and thing. All their clergy are upon a level; all equally exerci&s;ing the power of ordination, and every other branch of mini|&s;terial authority. And as to tho&s;e prote&s;tant churches which have officers they &s;tile bi&s;hops, &s;uperintendents or &s;eniors; they are little more than &s;tanding moderators, pretending to no &s;uperiority, by divine right, over their
<PB N="152" REF="010800_0077_0F81D1627038E8E0">brethren. <Q>All the&s;e churches, &s;ays Dr. Stillingfleet, ac|knowlege no &s;uch thing as the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy, but &s;tiffly maintain Jerom's opinion, of the primitive equality of all go&s;pel-mini&s;ters.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren, p. 411.</NOTE> Nor can they do otherwi&s;e; having at bottom no other than pre&s;byterian ordination among them: For Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Me|lancthon, Bugenhagius, &amp;c. and all the fir&s;t reformers and founders of the&s;e churches, who ordained mini&s;ters among them, were them&s;elves pre&s;byters and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS again clearly proves, that they do in fact allow our ordinations to be valid; for they are the &s;ame with theirs. Theirs are performed by pre&s;byters, pa&s;tors, by divine right, all in a &s;tate of equality: The &s;ame al&s;o are ours. If therefore they allow their own, they mu&s;t allow ours which are the &s;ame. And that this is the ca&s;e in fact, is evident from particular in&s;tances of their practice. In Holland, tho' they allow a liberty of con&s;cience to tho&s;e of other denominations, yet no mini&s;ters are &s;upported by the public, but tho&s;e of their own profe&s;&s;ion: But it is an un|doubted truth, as I am informed, that they do in fact &s;up|port one or more Scotch pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, ju&s;t as they do their own. This plainly &s;hews, that they look upon the pre&s;byters in Scotland, as their brethren, of the &s;ame church with them&s;elves, and undeniably proves, that they allow of their ordination, and con&s;equently of ours in this country, which is the &s;ame. The Dutch churches there|fore in Europe, beyond di&s;pute allow the validity of our ordinations. In America the ca&s;e is the &s;ame. Here there are &s;undry Dutch churches, originating from, and upon the &s;ame con&s;titution with, the reformed prote&s;tant church|es in Holland. The&s;e allow the validity of our ordinati|ons. A number of years ago a young gentleman of Dutch extract, came to New-Haven, and was ordained by our mini&s;ters, at the college there, as a mini&s;ter for the Dutch churches in the county of Albany. This, as my author tells me, was done by order of the cla&s;&s;is in Holland. The Reverend Mr. Woo&s;ly, who was ordained by a number of Connecticut mini&s;ters, over the church and congregation
<PB N="153" REF="010800_0077_0F81D1627038E8E0">of Southold on Long-I&s;land; after he left that people, and removed to his plantation in Oy&s;ter-Bay, preached and ad|mini&s;tered the &s;acrament, in a Dutch church in that town, for 20 years together. The &s;ame did the Reverend Mr. Ketteltas &s;ince. He was ordained mini&s;ter of Elizabeth-Town, by the pre&s;bytery in New-Jer&s;ey. After he left that people, at the invitation of &s;undry Dutch churches in Queen's-County, Long-I&s;land, he officiated as their mini|&s;ter for &s;ome time. The &s;ame gentleman is now improved in the mini&s;try, in the French prote&s;tant church in the city of N. York. Now the&s;e are &s;o many expre&s;s in&s;tances, in which our ordinations have been, in fact, acknowledged and allowed to be valid by the foreign prote&s;tant churches. And yet in direct oppo&s;ition to this inconte&s;tible evidence, in the very face of the&s;e &s;tubborn and ob&s;tinate facts, Mr. L. has the a&s;&s;urance, &s;hall I call it? to tell his readers <Q>that none of the&s;e foreign prote&s;tants, (meaning the Dutch, French, &amp;c.) will admit of a man ordained by <HI>our di&s;&s;enters,</HI> (as he calls us by way of contempt) to admini|&s;ter the &s;acraments in their churches." "That they con|demn, and find as much fault with our ordinations, as the epi&s;copalians (meaning him&s;elf and tho&s;e of his high|flying principles) do."

<PB N="155" REF="010800_0078_0F81D163354373C8">the <HI>univer&s;al practice,</HI> and the <HI>private &s;entiments</HI> of the fo|reign prote&s;tants, do not amount to a full proof of their being &s;trictly pre&s;byterian in principle them&s;elves, and of their approbation, and allowance of our ordinations, as valid and &s;criptural, I mu&s;t forever de&s;pair of &s;eeing any <HI>fact</HI> proved, in any ca&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. L. tells us, <Q>the whole that is aimed at, in the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, is to condemn the u&s;urpation of the pope, not to condemn epi&s;copacy.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 65.</NOTE> An&s;wer. 'Tis e|vident to demon&s;tration, from the foregoing te&s;timonies, they meant to condemn both; and that for this plain rea|&s;on, becau&s;e both are equally <HI>un&s;criptural,</HI> both re&s;t upon the &s;ame foundation. I defy any man to condemn the ro|mi&s;h tyranny, and at the &s;ame time, defend the engli&s;h hierarchy, upon any con&s;i&s;tent principles. Epi&s;copacy is epi&s;copacy, whether in England or Rome. Whoever op|po&s;es it in the latter, mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, condemn it in the former. Be&s;ides, &s;ome of the above te&s;|timonies, e&s;pecially Beza's, as expre&s;sly condemns epi&s;co|pacy in Great-Britain, as at Rome. He calls it the <HI>pe&s;t,</HI> the <HI>plague</HI> of the church, and equally ruinous to to its wel|fare in the former, as in the latter.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Mr. L. appeals to the foreign churches, <Q>whe|ther any pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters are maintained by them, &amp;c. but only &s;uch as have been ordained according to the method of tho&s;e churches.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 66.</NOTE>&mdash;An&s;wer: Doubtle&s;s none but <HI>&s;uch,</HI> are received and maintained by them. And this again is a clear evidence that they approve of and al|low our ordinations to be valid, and that our mini&s;ters and ordinations are the &s;ame, in their opinion, with theirs, &s;ince they do, in fact, as has been &s;hewn above, receive and main|tain them in their churches, ju&s;t as they do their own.
<PB N="156" REF="010800_0079_0F81D163ECD7E778">How injuriou&s;ly then does Mr. L. treat the foreign pro|te&s;tants thus to repre&s;ent them as patrons of his un&s;criptu|ral &s;cheme, and endeavour to fa&s;ten upon them, the odious imputation of maintaining his uncharitable and &s;chi&s;mati|cal principles? What impo&s;ition upon the reader to attempt to beget in him a belief of this groundle&s;s a&s;per&s;ion?</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone thro' with my remarks upon Mr. L's book. Have very particularly examined, and I tru&s;t, fully an&s;wered every thing in it, worthy of notice. Scripture, rea&s;on and authentic hi&s;tory, have been my guides thro' the whole enquiry; and, unle&s;s I am much mi&s;taken, his principles and conduct &s;tand condemned by all three. The re&s;ult is,&mdash;that neither in the &s;acred &s;criptures, nor the writings of the ancient fathers,&mdash;neither in the opinion of the fir&s;t reformers, the con&s;titutions and practice of the fo|reign prote&s;tants, nor even in the principles of the <HI>true</HI> church of England it&s;elf, is there the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a foun|dation for dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, con&s;idered as of <HI>divine right.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Chri&s;t a&s;cended he left the eleven apo&s;tles, the only mini&s;ters of his church; all ve&s;ted with the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, all equal in power. Authorized by this com|mi&s;&s;ion they went forth,&mdash;preached the go&s;pel, planted churches, and ordained mini&s;ters in them, ve&s;ted them with the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion they them&s;elves bore. No account is to be found of their fixing &s;ome in a &s;uperior, others in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. The mini&s;ters they ordained, were all of one order, promi&s;cuou&s;ly called bi&s;hops, pa&s;tors, or el|ders. As the general commi&s;&s;ion is but one, &s;o one me|thod of introduction into office, one &s;et of qualifications in order to it, one work or bu&s;ine&s;s for them when introduced, and one only, is to be found in the word of God. This was the order fixed by Chri&s;t, and followed by his apo&s;tles. They invariably adhered to that divine maxim of the great head of the church; <Q>call no man your ma&s;ter upon earth, for one is your ma&s;ter in heaven, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren.</Q> This was tran&s;mitted to the primitive chri&s;tians, and ob&s;erved in the pure&s;t and earlie&s;t ages of the church. A defection from this original <HI>parity,</HI> 'tis
<PB N="157" REF="010800_0079_0F81D163ECD7E778">granted, pretty &s;oon aro&s;e. "The mi&s;tery of iniquity be|gan "to work," even before the apo&s;tles were dead. A thir&s;t of dominion and eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre-eminence, early opperated among&s;t the mini&s;ters of the meek and lowly JESUS. This increa&s;ed from le&s;s to more, till <Q><HI>that</HI> man of &s;in, the &s;on of perdition, who exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called GOD, or is wor&s;hiped,</Q> got him&s;elf fairly mounted upon the &s;even-headed bea&s;t, and en&s;laved all chri&s;tendom with his u&s;urped dominion. From this yoke of anti-chri&s;tian tyranny, when great part of Europe was happily delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation, the ancient <HI>parity</HI> among mini&s;ters, generally took place. By far the greate&s;t part of the prote&s;tant churches, recur|red to the original &s;criptural plan of pre&s;byterian order and government. And where in any in&s;tance, as in England, they adopted the epi&s;copal mode, it was not under any pre|tence of divine right, but wholly in conformity to the form of government in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE above facts are indubitably clear, from &s;cripture, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, ancient and modern. On the&s;e facts the rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions are founded, contained in the foregoing pages. For the truth of the facts I appeal to the authentic writings afore&s;aid. For the ju&s;tne&s;s of the rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions deduced from them, the candid reader is now to determine.</P>
<P>IF dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy be of divine right, it is certainly contained in &s;cripture. If it be of &s;uch va&s;t importance, as is pretended, it mu&s;t be very clearly and expre&s;sly revealed there. Doctrines of importance, truths e&s;&s;ential to religion, are not left to be collected barely from dark hints and doubtful expre&s;&s;ions; but are clearly revealed, and often repeated, in various modes of diction, <Q>that he who runs may read them.</Q> But is this the ca&s;e with dioce&s;an epi&s;|copacy? The warme&s;t advocate for it, I pre&s;ume, will not pretend it is. All that the learned labour of its able&s;t cham|pions has hitherto been able to produce, is barely &s;ome dark hints and doubtful expre&s;&s;ions, which a fruitful invention may turn to &s;avour it; but the&s;e capable of a more rational
<PB N="158" REF="010800_0080_0F81D167AEEAA690">interpretation upon the contrary &s;cheme. And yet to this point of <HI>doubtful di&s;putation,</HI> the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential doctrines and expre&s;s precepts of our holy religion, it &s;eems, mu&s;t be made a &s;acrifice. That men fulfil their promi&s;es, perform their covenant obligations, and religiou&s;ly regard their &s;o|lemn vows, is not only one of the fir&s;t dictates of natural religion; but very expre&s;sly and repeatedly enjoined in the word of God. But when men, who have &s;olemnly dedi|cated them&s;elves to the mini&s;try in our churches, renounce their ordination vows, and take epi&s;copal orders: When profe&s;&s;ors among us, who &s;olemnly promi&s;ed and covenant|ed before God, angels and men, to walk in communion with us, rend them&s;elves off, and join the epi&s;copal &s;epa|ration, under a pretence of the divine right of epi&s;copacy, who does not &s;ee that <HI>doubtful points</HI> are preferred to <HI>po&s;&s;i|tive precepts;</HI> and that more weight is laid upon the for|mer, than the latter? If this is not to &s;ub&s;titute <Q>mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, in&s;tead of the weightier matters of the law.</Q> 'tis indeed hard to &s;ay what is. And after all; what is gained, in point of <HI>valid mini&s;try and ordinances?</HI> Why truly, upon their own principles, ju&s;t nothing at all. If our mini&s;ters have no power, then our admini&s;trations are invalid, our bapti&s;ms a mere nullity. Tho&s;e therefore who have been baptized in our churbhes, are in a &s;tate of mere heatheni&s;m, let them conform to what church they will. As this is the ca&s;e with mo&s;t of their mini&s;ters in this country, they mu&s;t, upon this principle, be &s;o far from be|ing the only regular mini&s;ters, that they are not even vi&s;i|ble chri&s;tians; and in&s;tead of being the only per&s;ons im|powered to di&s;pen&s;e go&s;pel admini&s;trations, they have no right even to partake of them them&s;elves. Con&s;equently all they pretend to baptize, are &s;till in a &s;tate of heathen|i&s;m, and &s;o all their mini&s;ters and churches, as well as ours, in the &s;ame wretched and deplorable condition. Who can &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch doctrines as the&s;e, are to be found in the bi|ble? who can imagine, claims and principles, productive of &s;uch &s;hocking con&s;equences, have any warrant from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t? A moments cool reflection, methinks,
<PB N="159" REF="010800_0080_0F81D167AEEAA690">might &s;hew their ab&s;urdity, and give a check to the advo|cates of them, in their warme&s;t career of <HI>pro&s;elyting</HI> zeal. Verily, gentlemen, a little more con&s;i&s;tency of principle and conduct here, would not be ami&s;s. Let us fir&s;t &s;ee you concerned to &s;ecure for your &s;elves, a valid bapti&s;m: Then it will be time enough to pre&s;s us with the argument of your only valid mini&s;try. When we &s;ee you properly concerned for your own &s;afety, it may po&s;&s;ibly convince us that you are &s;incere, in your zealous attempts to promote ours.</P>
<P>IF Mr. L. or any other, will ju&s;t remove the&s;e difficul|ties, and favour us with a &s;olid, &s;criptural and thoro' re|futation of the foregoing arguments, it will be kindly re|ceived, and properly noticed. But if only bold a&s;&s;ertions, fal&s;e quotations, and a &s;uperficial glance, upon here and there a &s;entence, is offered to the public, under the &s;peci|ous pretence of <HI>a full an&s;wer,</HI> it will be treated with de&s;erv|ed neglect.</P>
<P>MAY the father of lights direct our enquiries, and the God of truth lead us into all truth. May the &s;aving influ|ences of the &s;pirit of peace and holine&s;s, &s;o remarkable in the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians, be &s;hed forth in plen|tiful effu&s;ions, upon all orders and denominations. That &s;o, however we differ in &s;entiments in &s;ome le&s;&s;er things, we may all agree in "choo&s;ing the one thing needful," and finally unite our hearts and voices, in endle&s;s hallelujahs, to our common Lord and Redeemer. AMEN.</P>
