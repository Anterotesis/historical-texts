<P>For further Proof of their Right to the Country they have conquered, they have in all their Treaties with his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Governments re&s;pecting it, re&s;erved to them&s;elves a Right to demand a further Con&s;ideration for all un&s;ettled Lands that they, nor their Ance&s;tors, have not made particular Grants of to di&s;tinct Governments and received a valuable Con&s;ideration for; and they always do demand a Con&s;ide|ration and have it, as our Settlements do extend further into their Country, before they will execute a Deed of Con|veyance, in&s;i&s;ting that the Country belongs to them in Right of Conque&s;t, having bought it with their Blood, and taken it from their Enemies in fair War. Thus the Proprietors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> in 1736 bought of them all the Land on both Sides the Forks of the <HI>Su&s;quehanah</HI> River as far South as the Province extends, and to the Northward to tho&s;e called the <HI>Endle&s;s Mountains</HI> or <HI>Kitiochtinny Hills</HI> as far as the Province extends that Way.

<P>From this Detail of hi&s;torical Facts, it is plain that the Five <HI>Nations</HI> have a fair and indubitable Title to their hereditary and conquered Country, and they have on all Occa|&s;ions availed them&s;elves of the Advantages re&s;ulting from it.</P>
<P>The Extent of their Right by Inheritance and Conque&s;t is to the Ea&s;tward, on the South Side of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> the We&s;tern Bounds of <HI>New-England,</HI> and on the North Side of that River, the <HI>Utawawas</HI> River and Lake <HI>Abitibis.</HI> Its South We&s;tern Boundary is from Lake <HI>Abitibis</HI> to the North Ea&s;t End of Lake <HI>Michigan,</HI> and from thence thro' that Lake to the River <HI>Illinois,</HI> and from thence down that Ri|ver to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi.</HI> And its We&s;tern Boundary is from the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Illinois</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> as the latter runs South to <HI>Georgia.</HI> This is a va&s;t Country, ex|tending about twelve hundred Miles in Length from North to South, and from &s;even to eight hundred Miles in Breadth, where the Five <HI>Nations</HI> de&s;troyed many Nations, of whom there are now no Accounts among the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But the French Geographers, <HI>D'Li&s;le, Du Fur, &amp;c.</HI> have in their late Maps limited their Rights Northward, to a South We&s;t Line they have drawn from <HI>Montreal</HI> to Lake <HI>Toronto,</HI> where they al&s;o bound them to the We&s;tward, and allow
<PB N="20" REF="007434_0021_102D863DBB29A910">them only the Country between this Line and our Settlements. However, to point out the Mi&s;takes, or rather de&s;igned En|croachments, of the Maps of <HI>America</HI> publi&s;hed in France, of late Years, by Authority, would be almo&s;t to copy the whole of them.

<P>The <HI>Five Nations</HI> never alienated any Part of their here|ditary or conquered Country to any but his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and his Subjects. But in 1672 the French, when at Peace with the Five <HI>Nations,</HI> per&s;uaded them to allow a Hou&s;e to be built on the North Side of the Ea&s;t Entrance into Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> under the Pretence of a Store for Merchandize. Under the &s;ame Pretence they built &s;everal other Hou&s;es the next Year about the Lakes; but they &s;oon converted the&s;e trading Hou&s;es into &s;uch Forts as the Five <HI>Nations</HI> could not reduce without Cannon and knowing how to u&s;e them. However they complained to the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> of this U&s;urpa|tion, and told him, <Q>They could place no Confidence in the French, for under the Pretence of building Hou&s;es that might be a Rendezvous for Merchants, and that only <HI>Beavers</HI> and Merchandize &s;hould enter them, they had made them Places of Retreat for <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and for <HI>Arms and Ammunition</HI> of War; whereby they had &s;topped the Growth of the Tree of Peace that had been planted, and prevented its Branches from covering their Countries.</Q> And the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> prote&s;ted al&s;o again&s;t the&s;e Forts as Encroachments upon the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s Territories. But notwith&s;tanding this, in 1684, the Year a Rupture broke out again with the French and Five Nations, they built another Fort, with four Ba&s;tions, at <HI>Naigara</HI> Falls in the Streight between Lakes <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie;</HI> which was al&s;o prote&s;ted again&s;t by the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> as <HI>P.

In 1712 <HI>Louis</HI> XIV, granted the Sieur <HI>Crozat</HI> a Patent for all Lands bounded by <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> and by the Lands of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> all the Settlements, Ports, Havens, Rivers, and principally the Port and Haven of the I&s;le <HI>Dauphin,</HI> heretofore called <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre;</HI> the River of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> heretofore called Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, from the Edge of the Sea as far as the <HI>Illinois;</HI> together with the River of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> heretofore called the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ourys;</HI> and of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> heretofore called the <HI>Oubache.</HI> With all
<PB N="26" REF="007434_0027_102D864A795A5B98">the Countries, Territories, Lakes within Land, and the Ri|vers which fall directly or indirectly into the above part of St. <HI>Louis.</HI> In the Preamble to this vague, loo&s;e, and indeter|minate Grant, the King &s;ets forth no other Title to it than the Sieur <HI>De La Salle</HI>'s Voyage in 1683, as the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, acknowledging al&s;o that the King did not give Orders for the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Colony till after the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> in 1697. And the King al&s;o expre&s;ly declares the principle Object of this Grant to be, that a Communi|cation may be made between <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;iani</HI> by help of the Lakes and Rivers, which of all things we ought to prevent the Continuance of, or adieu to the Peace and Pro&s;|perity of our Colonies. When this Patent is dated we were at War with both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and that we took no Notice of it at the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> is not to be wondered at, when we call to mind the Characters and Abilities of the Negociators on our Part of that Treaty. In 1714 they built a Fort, which now mounts fourteen Cannon, at <HI>Alibamous</HI> in the Heart of our Subjects the Upper <HI>Creek Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and in the Center of that part, to the Ea&s;tward of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, of the Province we now call <HI>Georgia,</HI> which Spot we actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thirty Years before by trading Hou&s;es for the <HI>Indians.</HI> In 1717 the Capital of <HI>Loui&s;iani,</HI> called <HI>New-Orleans,</HI> was founded. And that Year the Patentee, finding his Enter|pri&s;e very unprofitable, relinqui&s;hed his Patent to the Regent of <HI>France,</HI> upon which the famous, or rather infamous Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ipi Company, or Bubble, was formed. This failing, to the Ruin of Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ands, the King took it into his own Hands where it has continued ever &s;ince, and is now va&s;tly increa&s;ed in Inhabitants and Fortifications. This is the Account of the Origin and Progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> U&s;urpation of the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ipi that they have been &s;o obliging as to publi&s;h to the World them&s;elves. And certainly if there be any &s;uch thing as Law or Ju&s;tice upon this earthly Ball between Nation and Nation, the <HI>French</HI> have ju&s;t as much Rign to that Part of <HI>Loui&s;iani</HI> to the Northward of twenty-nine Degrees of North Latitude, as a <HI>Frenchman</HI> would have to one of the <HI>King</HI>'s Fore&s;ts in this <HI>I&s;land</HI> upon coming from <HI>France,</HI> walk|ing

And no Man I believe can treat this as a chimerical Su&s;picion, when he recollects the con&s;tant En|croachments the French have made upon the Spaniards in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> or St. <HI>Domingo</HI> ever &s;ince they got footing there, and upon all their Neighbours in all Parts of the Globe at all Times. But if they &s;hould not further encroach on the Spaniards in <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> if they &s;ettle St. <HI>Bernard's-Bay,</HI> there cannot be any Doubt but they will avail them&s;elves of the greate&s;t Part of the Trade of New-Mexico; for by their Settlements at the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, they are come into a pretty hand&s;ome Share of it already, as fully appeared by the Capture of the <HI>Golden Lion</HI> from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi in the late War, which Ship had an immen&s;e Sum of Money on Board that &s;he took in at the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi. And this could not come from thence if the <HI>French</HI> had not ex|changed their <HI>European</HI> Manufactures for it with the <HI>New-Mexicans.</HI> Therefore it is of the utmo&s;t Importance to <HI>Spain</HI> to deprive them of that Part of <HI>New-Mexico</HI> which they claim; and why they did not oblige <HI>France</HI> to annihilate this Claim at the Treaty of <HI>Utretcht</HI> is very ea&s;ily accounted for, when we recollect <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. had ju&s;t put his Grand|&s;on on the Throne of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

To lay an early Foun|dation for a firm and la&s;ting Friend&s;hip, they a&s;&s;ured the <HI>Americans</HI> that they did not come among them as Invaders but Purcha&s;ers, and therefore called an A&s;&s;embly of them together to enquire who had the Right to di&s;po&s;e of their Lands; and being told it was their <HI>Sachems</HI> or Princes, they thereupon agreed with them for what Di&s;tricts they bought, publickly and in open Market. If they did not pay a great Price for their Purcha&s;es, yet they paid as much as they were worth. For it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that Lands were of little U&s;e to the Natives, and therefore but of little Value. They lived chiefly on Fi&s;h and Fowl and Hunting, becau&s;e they would not be at the Pains to clear and break up the Ground. And as for their Meadows and Mar&s;hes, they were of no U&s;e at all, for want of Neat Cattle
<PB N="33" REF="007434_0034_102D865A2FBCDB10">to feed them, of which there were none in tho&s;e Parts of the World. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had no &s;ooner made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for them&s;elves, than they applied their Cares for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by endeavouring to bring them from their wild Manner of Life to the civil and polite Cu&s;toms of <HI>Europe.</HI> For this Purpo&s;e they marked out Land to build <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, &s;upplied them with all proper Uten&s;ils for Building, pre&s;cribed to them Forms of Government, and above all omitted no Pains to bring them acquainted with the Go&s;pel; for whatever the fir&s;t <HI>Adventurers</HI> to <HI>North-America</HI> might be, the fir&s;t real <HI>Settlers</HI> were indu&s;trious, peaceable, con&s;cientious Per&s;ons, di&s;&s;enting from the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, though agreeing with it in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> who removed into tho&s;e remote Regions, upon no other View than to enjoy the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences without Hazard to them&s;elves, or Offence to others; they were not Crimi|nals, nor were they nece&s;&s;itous; nor had they, with their Brethren, made any Attempt to overthrow the Church and State at Home, and being di&s;appointed therein went to <HI>America</HI> to &s;ecure a Retreat for their Brethren, as the high-flying Mr. <HI>Salmon</HI> vainly imagines, and mo&s;t fal&s;ely and injuriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erts they did. And what I &s;ay of them, their uniform proper Conduct, and meek Principles of Obedience, on all Occa|&s;ions, fully prove. After they were arrived &s;ome time, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary, they made Laws to forbid any Per&s;on purcha&s;ing Lands without the Approbation of the Legi&s;la|ture, to prevent the Natives being over-reached, or ill u&s;ed in their private Bargains: And tho&s;e Lands, lying mo&s;t con|venient for them, have in mo&s;t of our Colonies been made unalienable, and never to be purcha&s;ed out of their Hands, than which nothing could more demon&s;trate the Colonies Care and Concern for the Natives. And this their Conduct to them is fully and conclu&s;ively proved by the Laws of al|mo&s;t every one of our <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies. Yet nothing could oblige the <HI>Indians</HI> to Peace and Friend&s;hip in &s;ome of our Provinces. They were alarmed with &s;trong Jealou&s;ies of the growing Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> therefore began a War with a Re&s;olution to extirpate them, before they had too well
<PB N="34" REF="007434_0035_102D865BC4223658">e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves, which forced our People to pur&s;ue them through all their Rece&s;&s;es, till they obliged them to enter into a &s;olemn Treaty of Peace. Such however was the perfidious Nature of &s;ome of the <HI>American</HI> Savages, that they &s;oon renewed their Ho&s;tilities, though to their own fatal Co&s;t. And ever &s;ince the Settlement of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada,</HI> many Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> have almo&s;t con&s;tantly, both in Peace and War with the <HI>Two Crowns,</HI> been animated and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them to war again&s;t &s;ome one or other of our Colonies, and have given them but few Intervals of Peace, and tho&s;e very &s;hort ones, to this Day.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and humane Con|duct of our Colonies, in a legi&s;lative Character, which has al&s;o been extended to all Dealings and Intercour&s;e with the Natives, I am &s;en&s;ible great Frauds and Abu&s;es have been impo&s;ed upon the <HI>Indians</HI> by private People, in Defiance of the &s;evere&s;t Laws, and the mo&s;t punctual Execution of them on Offenders when detected. But Experience daily con|vinces us that in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t regulated Societies, Laws framed with the greate&s;t Care, and the nice&s;t Judgment, are eluded and violated; and therefore no wonder if Infant Colo|nies &s;hould find the &s;ame Di&s;regard to Laws, which is to be &s;een uncorrected under Governments of the longe&s;t Duration and mo&s;t improved Policy. Con&s;equently there would be ju&s;t as much Propriety in charging the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> with being Sharpers, Thieves, Robbers, and Murderers, becau&s;e every Month a Dozen or two of Per&s;ons in this Kingdom are convicted of, and puni&s;hed for, the&s;e Crimes, and many more e&s;cape both; as it is to charge the Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s with Frauds, Abu&s;es, Encroachments, and Murders upon the poor <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> becau&s;e a few among them have been &s;o hardy and diabolical as to perpetrate &s;uch Villainies, &s;ome of whom have been puni&s;hed, and &s;ome have e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Claims in <HI>North-America</HI> are not only valid in Oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> but he al&s;o derives a Right from the <HI>native</HI> Proprietors of the Soil, his Subjects there having purcha&s;ed part with their Money, and the re&s;t has been yielded to them by the true Owners, who
<PB N="35" REF="007434_0036_102D865F027034E0">have put them&s;elves and their Lands under the Superinten|dency and Protection of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that they might be &s;ecured again&s;t the Encroachments and Depre|dations of the <HI>French.</HI> And the Right re&s;ulting from the Purcha&s;es and Ce&s;&s;ions of the Natives, as much as it is de|cried and undervalued by &s;ome People, is in fact the only ju&s;t and equitable one. Therefore I am extremely &s;orry to &s;ee any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, at this critical Conjuncture e&s;|pecially, endeavouring to prove that we derive no Title from the <HI>Natives,</HI> and that they are not the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it not only gives <HI>France</HI> a handle again&s;t us, but it makes many of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s &s;ober and thinking Subjects doubt the Ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e, and when this is the Ca&s;e they do not a&s;&s;i&s;t in the common Cau&s;e with that Spirit and Ability they otherwi&s;e would do, and which was never wanted to be exerted to the utmo&s;t, more than at this pre&s;ent Time.</P>

<P>_I SHALL &s;tate the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments and Depre|dations in each of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Provinces of <HI>North-America,</HI> as the Continent is now divided by the Authority of the <HI>Crown,</HI> beginning to the <HI>Northward;</HI> where|by we &s;hall have a clearer Idea of their Situation and Impor|tance, and of the Propriety of the Mea&s;ures hereafter to be humbly propo&s;ed for extirpating the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> out of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Territories.</P>
<P>Since the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chapelle</HI> they have erected in <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> one Fort at <HI>Beau ba&s;&s;in</HI> in the Cod of the <HI>Bay of Fundy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French <HI>En|croachments and Depre|dations in his Maje&s;ty's Province of</HI> Nova-Scotia</NOTE> and on the South Side of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of the South Ea&s;tern Penin&s;ula.

Indeed it is hard to conceive what Di&s;tre&s;s this handful of <HI>Indians</HI> have reduced this Colony to. They cannot clear and break up the Ground, nor plant nor &s;ow without their Pickets, nor go from one Vil|lage to another for Relief without imminent Danger, from &s;kulking <HI>Indians,</HI> of being killed and having their Scalps car|ried away for the French Bounty, or of being taken and either put to Death in the mo&s;t cruel Torments that &s;avage Bru|tality can invent, or of being carried away Captive to the French, who have afterwards in&s;i&s;ted on a Price for their Re|demption, equal to the Price <HI>black Slaves</HI> are &s;old for in our Colonies, under the &s;pecious Pretence of their having paid it to the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ave from being put to Death. Thus the French have made us pay the very Bounty they gave the <HI>Indians</HI> for captivating our People. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;urprized the Village of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> one Night, and altho' it had a Guard of Soldiers and was picketed in, they burnt the Hou&s;es, and put both Men, Women and Children to death. And from our fir&s;t Attempt to &s;ettle it &s;ince the late War with <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> have been killing or captivating our Peo|ple whenever Opportunity pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> al&s;o, as &s;oon as they had built tho&s;e two Forts, threatened to de&s;troy all the <HI>French</HI> Subjects of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and burn their Settlements without their Forts on the Penin&s;ula, if they did not retreat into the Country within their Forts; therefore they, who have always inclined to the <HI>French</HI> on account of their Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' ever indulged in the free Exerci&s;e of that and every thing el&s;e, burnt their Hou&s;es, de|&s;troyed their Plantations, and went under the Prorection of the <HI>French,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured them of ample Amends for their Lo&s;&s;es and Sufferings.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> have al&s;o re-built a Fort in this Province &s;ince the Peace of <HI>Aix La Chappelle,</HI> at the Entrance into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iver of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, on the We&s;tern Side of the Bay of <HI>Fundy</HI> oppo&s;ite to, and di&s;tant ten Leagues from <HI>Annapolis-Royal;</HI> by which they have the Command of the River St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Indians,</HI> being about an hundred and fifty fighting Men, whom they occa&s;ionally i&s;&s;ue upon the People of the North-Ea&s;t Parts of <HI>New-England.</HI> At the Entrance into this River there is a capacious Road for Ships of any Burthen, and on the North-Side of the Road is a Streight, not Pi&s;tol Shot over, through which there is no pa&s;&s;ing but at the Top of the Tide when the Water is upon a Level, for at other times the Fall is &s;o con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially at low Water, as to make a De&s;cent of thirty Feet. This Entrance on which the <HI>French</HI> Fort &s;tands, is lined on both Sides by a &s;olid Rock, and has more than forty Fathom of Water in its Middle. When you have pa&s;&s;ed this Streight the River &s;preads it&s;elf half a Mile in Width, and with a gentle Current towards its Outlet admits a delightful Navigation for large Ships, &s;ixty Miles into the Country, and much further for &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els; taking its Source from three parts of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River, one of which is directly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> have often conveyed Succours and Merchandize from <HI>Old France</HI> to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> both in Peace and War, up this River, to avoid the Difficulty and Ri&s;que of the Navigation of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> River.

<P>I &s;ay, this Conduct of the French is in Con&s;equence of an ancient De&s;ign or Sy&s;tem, and it certainly is &s;o, for all their Governors and Writers of the Northern Colonies have con|&s;tantly recommended it to the Court of France, who, we are now fatally convinced, have carried it &s;y&s;tematically into Ex|ecution.

For Experience teaches us, that the French always employ Times of Negotiation, not in endea|vouring to efface the Remembrance of pa&s;t Outrages, but in concerting the Operations for new ones. However, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has been &s;o long a Sufferer by French Perfidy, and &s;o often deluded by the treacherous Negotiations of that faith|le&s;s Nation, that it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he will any longer li&s;ten to their in&s;idious Propo&s;als, than till we are ready at Home and Abroad to give them a deci&s;ive Blow; therefore continuing to negotiate with them, while we are preparing for War, can do us no Injury, but may be very political. Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will &s;uffer her&s;elf to be again deceived by entering into a Treaty of Accommoda|tion with that perfidious Power, but what &s;ettles every Point in the Treaty, and does not refer the lea&s;t Particular to Com|mi&s;&s;aries, that can po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;puted, in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Af|rica,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> and not even this till his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> is re&s;tored to his ju&s;t Rights and Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
