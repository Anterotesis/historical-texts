<HEAD>THE LIFE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 11th of February (old &s;tyle) 1732, at the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, in We&s;tmoreland county, in Virginia. His father's family was numerous, and he was the fir&s;t fruit of a &s;econd marri|age. His education having been princi|pally conducted by a private tutor. At fifteen years old he was entered a mid|&s;hipman on board of a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el of war &s;tationed on the coa&s;t of Virginia, and his baggage prepared for embarka|tion: but the plan was abandoned on account of the reluctance his mother ex|pre&s;&s;ed to his engaging in that profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027221_0005_0FD58E58C96B6468">
Previous to this tran&s;action, when he was but ten years of age, his father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his elde&s;t brother, a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing talents, who had a com|mand in the colonial troops employed a|gain&s;t Carthagenia, and on his return from the expedition, named his new pa|trimonial man&s;ion MOUNT VERNON, in in honour of the admiral of that name, from whom he had received many civil|ities. He was afterwards made Adjutant General of the Virginia militia, but did not long &s;urvive. At his di&s;cea&s;e (not|with&s;tanding there are heirs of an elder branch who po&s;&s;e&s;s a large moiety of the paternal inheritance) the elde&s;t &s;on by &s;econd marriage inherited this &s;eat and a con&s;iderable landed property. In con&s;e|quence of the exten&s;ive limits of the co|lony, the vacant office of Adjutant Gen|eral was divided into three di&s;tricts, and the <HI>future Hero of America,</HI> before he at|tained his twentieth year, began his mil|itary &s;ervice by an appointment in that department, with the rank of major.</P>
<P>When he was little more than twenty one years of age, an event occurred which
<PB N="7" REF="027221_0006_0FD58E7B9EE58008">called his abilities into public notice. In 1753, while the government of the col|ony was admini&s;tered by lieutenant go|vernor Dinwiddie; encroachments were reported to have been made by the French, from Canada, on the territories of the Briti&s;h colonies, at the we&s;tward. Young Mr. Wa&s;hington, who was &s;ent with plenary powers to a&s;certain the facts, treat with the &s;avages, and warn the French to de&s;i&s;t from their aggre&s;&s;ions, performed the duty of his mi&s;&s;ion with &s;ingular indu&s;try, intelligence and ad|dre&s;s. His journal, and report to gov|ernor Dinwiddie, which were publi&s;hed, announced to the world that correctne&s;s of mind, manline&s;s in &s;tyle, and accura|cy in the mode of doing bu&s;ine&s;s, which have &s;ince characteri&s;ed him in the con|duct of more arduous affairs. But it was deemed, by &s;ome, an extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance that &s;o juvenile and inexperi|enced a per&s;on &s;hould have been employ|ed on a negociation, with which &s;ubjects of the greate&s;t importance were involv|ed: &s;ubjects, which &s;hortly after became the origin of a war between England and
<PB N="8" REF="027221_0007_0FD58E5A8397A998">France, that raged for many years through|out every part of the globe.</P>
<P>As the troubles &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the frontiers, the colony of Virginia rai&s;ed, the next year, a regiment of troops for their defence. Of this corp&s;e, Mr. Fry, one of the profe&s;&s;ors of the college, was appointed colonel, and Major Wa&s;hing|ton received the commi&s;&s;ion of Lieuten|ant Colonel. But Colonel Fry died the &s;ame &s;ummer, without ever having join|ed; and of cour&s;e left his regiment and rank to the &s;econd in command. Colo|nel Wa&s;hington made indefatigable ef|forts to form the regiment, e&s;tabli&s;h ma|gazines, and open roads &s;o as to pre-oc|cupy the advantageous po&s;t at the con|fluence of the Alleghany and Mononga|hela rivers, which he had recommended for that purpo&s;e in his reports the pre|ceeding year. He was to have been join|ed by a detachment of independent re|gulars from the &s;outhern colonies, toge|ther with &s;ome companies of provincials from North-Carolina and Maryland. But he perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of expe|dition, and without waiting for their ar|rival, commenced his march in the month
<PB N="9" REF="027221_0008_0FD58E7CC0788B60">of May. Notwith&s;tanding his precipita|ted advance, on his a&s;cending the Lau|rel-hill, fifty miles &s;hort of his object, he was advi&s;ed that a body of French had already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and erected a for|tification, which they named fort <HI>du Que&s;|ne.</HI> He then fell back to a place known by the appellation of <HI>the Great Mea|dows,</HI> for the &s;ake of forage and &s;upplies. Here he built a temporary &s;tockade, merely to cover his &s;tores; it was from its fate called fort <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> His force when joined by Captain M'Kay's regu|lars, did not amount to four hundred effectives. Upon receiving information from his &s;couts that a con&s;iderable party was approaching to reconnoitre his po&s;t, he &s;allied and defeated them. But in return he was attacked by an army, com|puted to have been fifteen hundred &s;trong, and after a gallant defence, in which more than one third of his men were killed and wounded, was forced to capitulate. The garri&s;on marched out with the honours of war, but were plun|dered by the Indians, in violation of the articles of capitulation. After this di&s;|a&s;ter, the remains of the Virginia re|glment
<PB N="10" REF="027221_0009_0FD58E5BCCF90798">returned to Alexandria to be re|cruited and furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies.</P>
<P>In the year 1755, the Briti&s;h govern|ment &s;ent to this country General Brad|dock, who, by the junction of two ve|teran regiments from Ireland, with the independent and provincial corps in America, was to repel the French from the confines of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements. Upon a royal arrangement of rank, by which "no officer who did not <HI>immedi|ately</HI> derive his commi&s;&s;ion from the king, could command one who did, "Colonel Wa&s;hington relinqui&s;hed his regiment, and went as an extra Aid-de-Camp into the family of General Braddock. In this capacity, at the battle of Monon|gahela, he attended that General, who&s;e, life was gallantly &s;acrificed in attempting to extricate his troops from the fatal am|bu&s;cade into which his over-weening con|fidence had conducted them. Braddock had &s;everal hor&s;es &s;hot under him, be|fore he fell him&s;elf; and there was not on officer who&s;e duty obliged him to be on hors back that day, excepting Colo|nel Wa&s;hington, who was not other killed or wounded. This circum&s;tance
<PB N="11" REF="027221_0010_0FD58E61F404F4A0">enabled him to di&s;play greater abilities in covering the retreat and &s;aving the wreck of the army, than he could otherwi&s;e have done. As &s;oon as he had &s;ecured their pa&s;&s;age over the ford of the Monon|gahela, and found they were not pur&s;ued, he hallened to concert mea&s;uers for their further &s;ecurity with Colonel Dunbar, who had remained with the &s;econd divi|&s;ion and heavy baggage at &s;ome di&s;tance in the rear. To effect this, he travelled with two guides, all night, through an almo&s;t impervious wilderne&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding the fatigues he had undergone in the day, and notwith&s;tanding he had &s;o imperfectly recovered from &s;ickne&s;s that he was obliged in the morning to be &s;upported with cu&s;hions on his hor&s;e. The public accounts in England and America were not par&s;imonious of ap|plau&s;e for the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice he had rendered on &s;o trying an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not long after this time, the regulation of rank, which had been &s;o injurious to the Coloniel officers, was changed to their &s;atisfaction, in con&s;equence of their di&s;|content and the remon&s;trance of Colonel Wa&s;hington; and the &s;upreme authority
<PB N="12" REF="027221_0011_0FD58E633874B2A0">of Virginia, impre&s;&s;ed with a due &s;en&s;e of his merits, gave him, in a new and exten&s;ive commi&s;&s;ion, the command of all the troops rai&s;ed, and to be rai&s;ed in that colony.</P>
<P>It would not comport with the intend|ed brevity of this &s;ketch, to mention in detail the plans he &s;ugge&s;ted or the &s;y&s;t|em he pur&s;ued for defending the fron|tiers, until the year 1758, when he com|manded the van brigade of Gen. Forbes's army in the capture of Fort du Que&s;ne. A &s;imilar rea&s;on will preclude the recital of the per&s;onal hazards and atchievements which happened in the cour&s;e of his &s;er|vice. The tranquility on the frontiers of the middle colonies having been re&s;tored by the &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, and the health of Colonel Wa&s;hington having be|come extremely debilitated by a inveterate pulmonary complaint, in 1759 here&s;igned his appointment. Authentic documents are not wanting to &s;hew the tender regret which the Virginia line expre&s;&s;ed at par|ting with their commander, and the af|fectionate regard which he entertained for them.</P>
<P>His health was gradually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.
<PB N="13" REF="027221_0012_0FD58E81925BA178">He married Mrs. Cu&s;tis,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General and Mrs. Wa&s;hington were both born in the &s;ame year.</NOTE> a hand&s;ome and amiable young widow, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample jointure; and &s;ettled as a plan|ter and farmer on the e&s;tate where he of|ten re&s;ides in Fairfax county. After &s;ome years he gave up planting tobacco, and went altogether into the farming bu&s;i|ne&s;s. He has rai&s;ed &s;even thou&s;and bu|&s;hels of wheat and ten thou&s;and bu&s;hels of Indian corn in one year. Although he has confined his own cultivation to this dome&s;tic tract of about nine thou|&s;and acres, yet he pofle&s;&s;es excellent lands in large quantities, in &s;everal o|ther counties. His judgment in the qualities of &s;oils, his command of mo|ney to avail him&s;elf of purcha&s;es, and his occa&s;ional employment in early life as a &s;urveyor, gave him opportunities of making advantageous locations; many of which are much improved.</P>
<P>After he left the army until the year 1775, he thus cultivated the arts of peace. He was con&s;tantly a member of A&s;&s;em|bly, a magi&s;trate of his county, and a
<PB N="14" REF="027221_0013_0FD58E64D37A38A8">judge of the court. He was elected a de|legate to the fir&s;t Congre&s;s in 1774; as well as to that which a&s;&s;embled the year following. Soon after the war broke out he was appointed by Congre&s;s comman|der in chief of the forces of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>It is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to particulari&s;e in this place his tran&s;actions in the late war, becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion which they made is yet fre&s;h in every mind. But it is hoped po&s;terity will be taught, in what manner he transformed an undi&s;ciplined body of pea|&s;antry into a regular army of &s;oldiers. Com|mentaries on his campaigns would un|doubtedly be highly intere&s;ting and in|&s;tructive to future generations. The conduct of the fir&s;t campaign, in com|pelling the Briti&s;h troops to abandon Bo&s;ton by a bloodle&s;s victory, will mer|it a minute narration. But a volumn would &s;carcely contain the mortifications he experienced and the hazards to which he was expo&s;ed in 1776 and 1777, in con|tending again&s;t the prowe&s;s of Britain, with an inadequate force. His good de&s;|tiny and con&s;umate prudence prevented want of &s;ucce&s;s from producing want of
<PB N="15" REF="027221_0014_0FD58E82B9DF5E60">confidence on the part of the public; for want of &s;ucce&s;s is apt to lead to the adop|tion of pernicious coun&s;els through the levity of the people or the ambition of their demagogues. Shortly after this pe|riod &s;prang up the only cabal that ever exi&s;ted during his public life, to rob him of his reputation and command. It pro|ved as impotent in effect as it was auda|cious in de&s;ign. In the three &s;ucceeding years the germ of di&s;cipline unfolded; and the re&s;ources of America having been called into co-operation with the land and naval armies of France, pro|duced the glorious conclu&s;ion of the campaign in 1781. From this time the gloom began to di&s;appear from our po|litical horizon, and the affairs of the U|nion proceeded in a meliorating train, until a peace was mo&s;t ably negociated by our amba&s;&s;adors in Europe, in 1783.</P>
<P>No per&s;on who had not the advantage of being pre&s;ent when General Wa&s;h|ington received the intelligence of peace, and who did not accompany him to his dome&s;&s;ic retirement, can de&s;cribe the re|lief which that joyful event brought to his labouring mind, or the &s;upreme &s;at|isfaction
<PB N="16" REF="027221_0015_0FD58E663604C410">with which he withdrew to pri|vate life. From his triumphal entry into New-York, upon the evacuation of that city by the Briti&s;h army, to his arrival at Mount Vernon, after the re&s;igna|tion of his commi&s;&s;ion to Congre&s;s, fe&s;tive crowds impeded his pa&s;&s;age through all the populous towns, the devotion of a whole people pur&s;ued him with prayers to Heaven for ble&s;&s;ings on his head, while their gratitude &s;ought the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive language of manife&s;t|ing it&s;elf to him, as their common fa|ther and benefactor. When he became a private citizen he had the unu&s;ual feli|city to find that his native &s;tate was a|mong the mo&s;t zealous in doing ju&s;tice to his merits; and that &s;tronger demon|&s;trations of affectionate e&s;teem (if po&s;&s;i|ble) were given by the citizens of his neighbourhood, than by any other de|&s;cription of men on the continent. But he has con&s;tantly declined accepting any compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices, or provi&s;ion for the augmented expences which have been incurred by him in con|&s;equence of his public employment, al|though propo&s;als have been made in the
<PB N="17" REF="027221_0016_0FD58E8451A5E9F0">mo&s;t delicate manner, particularly by the &s;tates of Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>The virtuous &s;implicity which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the private life of Gen. Wa&s;h|ington, though le&s;s known than the daz|ling &s;plendour of his military atchiev|ments; is not le&s;s edifying in example, or worthy the attention of his country|men. The con&s;picuous character he has acted on the theatre of human affairs, the uniform dignity with which he &s;u&s;|tained his part amid&s;t difficulties of the mo&s;t di&s;couraging nature, and the glory of having arrived through them at the hour of triumph, have made many offi|cial and literary per&s;ons, on both &s;ides of the ocean, ambitious of a corre&s;pond|ence with him. The&s;e corre&s;pondencies unavoidably engro&s;s a great portion of his time; and the communications con|tained in them, combined with the numerous periodical publications and news-papers which he peru&s;es, render him, as it were, the <HI>focus of political in|telligence for the new world.</HI> Nor are his conver&s;ations with well informed men le&s;s conducive to bring him ac|quainted with the various events which
<PB N="18" REF="027221_0017_0FD58E6ACE34EAC8">happen in different countries of the globe. Every foreigner of di&s;tinction, who travels in America, makes it a point to vi&s;it him. Members of Con|gre&s;s and other dignified per&s;onages do not pa&s;s his hou&s;e, without calling to pay their re&s;pects. As another &s;ource of information it may be mentioned, that many literary productions are &s;ent to him annually by their authors in Eu|rope; and that there is &s;carcely one work written in America, on any art, &s;cience, or &s;ubject, which does not &s;eek his protection, or which is not offered to him as a token of gratitude. Me|chanical inventions are frequently &s;ub|mitted to him for his approbation, and natural curio&s;ities pre&s;ented for his in|ve&s;tigation. But the multiplicity of epi&s;tolary applications, often on the re|mains of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which happened when he was commander in chief, &s;ome|times on &s;ubjects foreign to his &s;ituation, frivolous in their nature, and intended merely to gratify the vanity of the wri|ters by drawing an&s;wers from him is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and almo&s;t incredible. His benignity in an&s;wering, perhaps,
<PB N="19" REF="027221_0018_0FD58E872CDC5060">encrea&s;es the number. Did he not hu&s;band every moment to the be&s;t ad|vantage, it would not be in his power to notice the variety of &s;ubjects that claim his attention. Here a minuter de&s;cription of his dome&s;tic life may be expected.</P>
<P>To apply a life, at be&s;t but &s;hort, to the mo&s;t u&s;eful purpo&s;es; he lives as he ever has done, in the unvarying habits of regularity, temperance and indu&s;try. He ri&s;es, in winter as well as in &s;ummer at the dawn of day; and generally reads or writes &s;ome time before breakfa&s;t. He breakfa&s;ts about &s;even o'clock, on three &s;mall Indian hoe-cakes and as many di&s;hes of tea. He rides immediately to his different farms, and remains with his labourers until a little pa&s;t two o'clock, when he returns and dre&s;&s;es. At three he dines, commonly on a &s;ingle di&s;h, and drinks from half a pint to a pint of Madeira wine. This, with one &s;mall gla&s;s of punch, a draught of beer, and two di&s;hes of tea (which he takes half an hour before &s;un-&s;etting) con&s;ti|tates his whole &s;u&s;tenance until the next day. Whether there be company or not,
<PB N="20" REF="027221_0019_0FD58E6D013B3B38">the table is always prepared by its ele|gance and exuberance for their recep|tion; and the General remains at it for an hour after dinner, in familiar con|ver&s;ation and convivial hilarity. It is then that every one pre&s;ent is called up|on to give &s;ome ab&s;ent friend as a toa&s;t; the name not unfrequently awakens a plea&s;ing remembrance of pa&s;t events, and gives a new turn to the animated colloquy. General Wa&s;hington is more chearful than be was in the army. Al|though his temper is rather of a &s;erious ca&s;t, and his countenance commonly carries the impre&s;&s;ion of thoughtfulne&s;s, yet he perfectly reli&s;hes a plea&s;ant &s;tory, an unafected &s;ally of wit, or a burle&s;que de&s;cription which &s;urpri&s;es by its &s;ud|denne&s;s and incongruity with the ordi|nary appearance of the object de&s;cribed. After this &s;ociable and innocent relaxa|tion, he applies him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s; and about nine o'clock retires to re&s;t. This is the <HI>rotinc,</HI> and this the hour he ob|&s;erves, when no one but his family is pre&s;ent; at other times he attends po|litely upon his company until they wi&s;h to withdraw. He keeps a pack of
<PB N="21" REF="027221_0020_0FD58E6E78BAA4E0">hounds, and in the &s;ea&s;on indulges him|&s;elf with hunting once in a week; at which diver&s;ion the gentlemen of Alex|andria often a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Agriculture is the favourite employ|ment of Generel Wa&s;hington, in which he wi&s;hes to pa&s;s the remainder of his days. To acquire and communicate prac|tical knowledge, he corre&s;ponds with Mr. Arthur Young, who has written &s;o &s;en&s;ibly on the &s;ubject, and al&s;o with many agricultural gentlemen in this coun|try. As improvement is known to be his pa&s;&s;ion, he receives envoys with rare &s;eeds and re&s;ults of new projects from every quarter. He likewi&s;e makes co|pious notes, relative to his own experi|ments, the &s;tate of the &s;ea&s;ons, the na|ture of the &s;oils, the effects of different kinds of manure, and &s;uch other topics as may throw light on the farming bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>On Saturday in the afternoon, every week's reports are made by all his over|&s;eers, and regi&s;tered in books kept for that purpo&s;e: &s;o that at the end of the year, the quantity of labour and pro|duce may be accurately known. Order
<PB N="22" REF="027221_0021_0FD58E7055891790">and oeconomy are e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the departments within and without doors. His lands are enclo&s;ed in lots of equal dimen&s;ions, and crops are a&s;&s;igned to each for many years. Every thing is un|dertaken on a great &s;cale; but with a view to introduce or augment the culture of &s;uch articles as he conceives will be|come mo&s;t beneficial in their con&s;equences to the country. He has, in one year rai&s;ed two thou&s;and lambs, &s;owed twenty &s;even bu&s;hels of flax&s;eed, and planted more than &s;even hundred bu&s;hels of potatoes. In the mean time, the public may re&s;t per|&s;uaded that there is manufactured under his roof, linen and wollen cloth, nearly or quite &s;ufficient for the u&s;e of his nu|merous hou&s;hold.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL Montgomery de&s;cend|ed from a re&s;pectable family in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to liberty was innate, and matured by a fine edu|cation and an excellent under&s;tanding. Having married a wife, and purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in New-York, he was, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con|viction of the ju&s;tne&s;s of her cau&s;e, indu|ced to con&s;ider him&s;elf as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cau&s;e, and quitted the &s;weets of ea&s;y
<PB N="26" REF="027221_0025_0FD58E7756DD31F8">fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philo&s;ophical rural life, with the highe&s;t dome&s;tic felicity, to take an active &s;hare in all the hard&s;hips and dangers that at|tend the &s;oldiers life.</P>
<P>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the &s;ervice of En|gland, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que|bec, in the war of 1756, on the very &s;pot, where, when fighting under the &s;tandard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms again&s;t her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu|ral conte&s;t, was more &s;incerely, or more univer&s;ally lamented. And what is ex|traordinary, the mo&s;t eminent &s;peakers in the Briti&s;h parliament, forgetting for the moment, that he had died in oppo|&s;ing their cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, di&s;played all their eloquence in prai&s;ing his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow &s;oldi|er of his in the French war of 1756, &s;hed abundance of tears, while he expa|tiated on their pa&s;t friend&s;hip and mutu|al exchange of tender &s;ervices in that &s;ea&s;on of enterpri&s;e and glory.</P>

All enmity to this veteran &s;oldier ex|pired with his life; and re&s;pect to his private character prevailed over all other con&s;iderations. By the orders of Gen|ral Carlton, his dead body received eve|ry po&s;&s;ible mark of di&s;tinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the fir&s;t day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s were not unmindful of the merit of this amiable and brave officer, nor remi&s;s in manife&s;ting the e&s;teem and re&s;pect they entertained for his memory.

<P>There is a remarkable circum&s;tance connected with the fall of this brave offi|cer, that merits to be recorded, becau&s;e the fact is of a very intere&s;ting nature, and will &s;erve to perpetuate the memory of a very amiable and de&s;erving charac|ter, who was al&s;o a martyr in the cau&s;e of his country.

<P>One of General Montgomery's Aides|de-Camp, was Mr. Macpher&s;on, a mo&s;t promi&s;ing young man, who&s;e father re&s;id|ed at Philadelphia, and was greatly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in privateering in the war of 1756. This gentleman had a brother in the 16th regiment, in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, at the time of Montgomery's expedition into Cana|da, and who was as violent in favour of

The Aid-de-Camp immediately returned him an an&s;wer, full of &s;trong rea&s;oning in defence of his conduct, but by no means attempting to &s;hake the oppo&s;ite princi|ples of his brother, and not only free from acrimony, but full of expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and affection; this letter he dated, "From the &s;pot where Wolfe lo&s;t his life, in fighting the cau&s;e of En|gland, <HI>in fried&s;hip with America.</HI>" This letter had &s;carcely reached the officer at New-York, before it was followed by the news of his brother's death. The effect was in&s;tantaneous, nature, and per|haps
<PB N="31" REF="027221_0030_0FD58E94EA643410">rea&s;on prevailed; and a thou&s;and, not unworthy &s;entiments ru&s;hed upon his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mind; he quitted the En|gli&s;h &s;ervice, entered into that of Ameri|ca, and &s;ought every occa&s;ion of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf in her &s;ervice!</P>
