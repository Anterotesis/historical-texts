<HEAD>THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OF OLDFIELD. A MORAL TALE</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim recognized by every ob&s;erver of depraved human nature, "that he who has been ba&s;e enough e&s;&s;entially to injure the inno|cent, never forgives them." We may add, that mi&s;creants of this de&s;cription frequently pur&s;ue, with relentle&s;s hatred, even the po&s;terity of tho&s;e whom they have thus offended. Yet let it be re|membered, that if implacable villany kindles with malice again&s;t the injured victims; it is be|cau&s;e their pre&s;ence, and even their exi&s;tence, reminds him of his guilt, and makes him tremble for the dreaded retribution.</P>
<P>David Sini&s;ter had been forty years &s;tewar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;olicitor to Henry Oldfield, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> riche&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable families in the coun+ty of Hereford; and, at the time of that gentle|man's decea&s;e, he had contrived to ama&s;s a for|tune of about as many thou&s;and pounds. This ample &s;um however, &s;erved only to in&s;pire him
<PB N="2" REF="028632_0005_0FDA32CA06BA4E28">
with the diabolical de&s;ire of compleatly plun|dering his ma&s;ter's heir of the family-e&s;tate, a de&s;ing which he &s;oon found means effectually to execute. To enumerate the various artifices by which this abominable plan was accompli&s;h|ed, would be but to lay open tho&s;e dreadful &s;cenes of iniquity which are every day practi&s;ing, and again&s;t which no human laws can po&s;&s;ibly protect, with certainty, the haple&s;s victims of an infernal confederation.</P>
<P>The young man &s;truggled but a &s;hort time with his hard fate; but he lived long enough to leave behind, at the age of twenty-five, a fine boy on|ly two years old, who&s;e mother had, about three months before, fallen the victim of a pulmonary complaint.</P>
<P>Her father, the curate of a &s;mall village, in the county of Cambridge, took the infant under his protection: and not only made him acquainted with the rudiments of learning; but, what was of far higher value, implanted in his tender mind, the unfeigned love of virtue, and a firm reliance on Providence. He was him&s;elf of a con&s;ump|tive habit; and had long looked forward to the event which was to &s;end the poor heir of the hou&s;e of Oldfield hou&s;ele&s;s into the world. Yet he would &s;uddenly check the tear of apprehen|&s;ion, which his pious &s;oul deemed &s;inful; and pre&s;&s;ing the poor youth to his brea&s;t, as he &s;u&s;|tained him on his trembling knees, he would &s;ing with the mo&s;t cele&s;tial &s;weetne&s;s and fervour

<L>He who the raven's wants &s;upplies.</L>
<L>For all his creatures will provide;</L>
<L>To him I rai&s;e my ardent eyes,</L>
<L>In him my trembling lips confide:</L>
<L>And He, when my frail &s;pirit's fled,</L>
<L>Shall give my boy his daily bread.</L>
</LG>
<P>The fatal hour at length arrived; and Harry, then little more than fifteen years of age, having wept over the grave of his la&s;t earthly friend, bowed to the will of the Father of the fatherle&s;s, with a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;ignation. The effects of the worthy old gentleman were barely &s;ufficient to di&s;charge his trifling debts, and defray the fune|ral expences; and with &s;omething le&s;s than ten pounds in his pocket, this well-educated little orphan had the prudence to con&s;ider by what means he &s;hould obtain more, before this &s;mall &s;um became exhau&s;ted. At fir&s;t, he thought of trying his fortune in London; but this de&s;ign was abandoned, the in&s;tant he recollected what his grandfather had &s;aid re&s;pecting the vices of the metropolis, and the many dangers to which friend|le&s;s innocence and inexperienced youth are there expo&s;ed. Some employ, however, he re&s;olved, to &s;eek; and his heart &s;ighed to vi&s;it the family &s;tate of Oldfield Hall, which he had heard &s;o frequently and &s;o feelingly de&s;cribed. He was &s;en&s;ible of the height from which his poor father had fallen; and felt an ardent de&s;ire to vi&s;it the
<PB N="4" REF="028632_0006_0FDA32CF5EB19310">
cene of his family's pro&s;perous days. He flat|tered him&s;elf, &s;ome per&s;on might be left in the neighbourhood, who would kindly afford him food for his labour; and, at any rate, he con|ceived that he could &s;u&s;tain every hard&s;hip, on the &s;pot where Heaven had formerly &s;howered for them &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings. "Surely," thought he, "I &s;hall not be driven from fields, that were once theirs, without a few &s;cattered ears of corn! I &s;hall not be denied &s;ome &s;mall portion of the fruits that are free for "Nature's commoners." Not Heaven, that has hitherto provided for me, will not there for&s;ake me! My foot&s;teps may &s;ometimes pre&s;s the paths where they have trod; my eyes will behold views with which they have been delighted. I &s;hall there eat the bread of health, I &s;hall there drink the waters of tempe|rance, and be happy!" The&s;e were the reflec|tions that impelled him to &s;et out for Hereford|&s;hire; and that enabled him to "go on his way rejoicing," during a tedious journey of near a hundred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>He reached the abode of his ance&s;tors late in the evening; and crept, unperceived, into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> outhou&s;e, where he &s;lept peacefully till the morn|ing.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e &s;oon after the &s;un; and walked mu&s;|ing over the delightful grounds; and his eyes now &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, and now brightening with plea&s;ure, &s;urveyed every object with a &s;e+cret but melancholy &s;atisfaction. Ardently di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="028632_0006_0FDA32CF5EB19310">
he long to behold the internal parts of the fami|ly man&s;ion! but this was a gratification not to be expected; at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In this manner did he wander &s;everal days; &s;ometimes &s;leeping in the &s;hed where he had re|po&s;ed the fir&s;t night, and &s;ometimes reaching a &s;mall and lonely alehou&s;e, about a mile di&s;tant, the only habitation he could find in the neighbor|hood.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent owner of Oldfield Hall, he knew, had been the former &s;teward of the family; and he knew that his grandfather could never bear to hear the name of Sini&s;ter mentioned, without vi&s;ible emotion; But he little thought that his father had been robbed of his inheritance by the machinations of the cruel mon&s;ter, and his heart entertained not the &s;malle&s;t prejudice again&s;t a man who he &s;uppo&s;ed had become the legal pur|cha&s;er of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>David Sini&s;ter happened at this time to be from home. He was attending the a&s;&s;izes at Hereford, where he had been to convict a man for &s;heep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tealing; and who, though he had a wife and &s;even children almo&s;t &s;tarving, and it was his fir&s;t offence, immediately received &s;entence of death, and was ordered for execution.</P>
<P>Having performed this act of ju&s;tice, he re|turned with great &s;atisfaction. It was a fine &s;um|mer's evening; and, as he drew near home, he expatiated largely, to his &s;ervant, on the value
<PB N="6" REF="028632_0007_0FDA32D1097F1378">
of hone&s;ty; and on the turpitude of criminally appropriating another's property, however tri|vial, even from the ab&s;urd plea of nece&s;&s;ity, which the malefactor had alone urged in his defence&mdash; "Property," cried he, "is &s;o &s;acred that I would hang my own brother, were he living, if he rob|bed me of a &s;hilling to &s;ave him&s;elf from &s;tarv|ing!"</P>
<P>Scarcely had he uttered the&s;e words, when Har|ry Oldfield, who happened to be in the field next the road, where he was at that moment de|bating with his con&s;cience the propriety of draw|ing a turnip for his &s;upper, and who now re&s;olv|ed to run away from the temptation, ha&s;tily a&s;|cending the &s;tile, pre&s;ented, acro&s;s the road, the &s;hadow of his father, to the a&s;toni&s;hed eyes of this &s;tern di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice. The glance was tran&s;itory, as the electrick &s;troke; but, like the &s;troke of electricity, it thrilled through eve|ry fibre of his frame. The momentary check which it occa&s;ioned to his hor&s;e, and the depri|vation of his &s;peech which it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly ef|fected, gave the youth time to leap over the op|po&s;ite &s;tile, before Sini&s;ter could be thoroughly &s;atisfied whether what he beheld was reality, or the effect of &s;ome &s;upernatural appearance, the po&s;&s;ibility of which he had never till that in&s;tant believed. As &s;oon as he regained the power of utterance, though he feared to look back, he ventured to a&s;k his &s;ervant if he had &s;een any thing, and de&s;ired him now to ride a little before.
<PB N="7" REF="028632_0007_0FDA32D1097F1378">
The &s;ervant had been &s;urprized at his ma&s;ter's &s;udden taciturnity; and he was now a&s;toni&s;hed at his que&s;tion, as well as his reque&s;t: advancing his hor&s;e, however, he in&s;tantly replied, that he had &s;een nothing but a poor boy, who had ju&s;t ha&s;tily cro&s;&s;ed the road. "Are you &s;ure it was a boy?" &s;aid Sini&s;ter: "the &s;hade appeared like that of a very tall man."&mdash;"La! Sir," replied the &s;ervant; "our &s;hadows, you know, always grow longer at &s;un&s;et!"&mdash;"That's true," repli|ed Sini&s;ter: "but &s;till&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed&mdash;to con&s;ider whether he was not about to &s;ay, what he might afterwards wi&s;h retracted: and, as they had now approached within a half a mile of the hou&s;e, not another &s;yllable did he ri&s;que till they arrived there.</P>
<P>At home, though he was &s;urrounded with ele|gance, he had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any other enjoy|ment than that of ama&s;&s;ing wealth, which he had not the &s;pirit to enjoy. For innocent amu&s;ements he had no reli&s;h; reading was a wa&s;te of time; and reflection was death. He was beloved by no human being: even his &s;on, whom he waded through iniquity, and even blood it&s;elf, to enno|ble, at once dreaded and de&s;pi&s;ed him. His wife had long &s;ince fallen the victim to his cruelty; if, indeed, her death had not been ha&s;tened by an artful &s;trumpet whom &s;he had indi&s;creetly made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her companion, and with whom he now openly cohabited. She, indeed, it is true, produced him a couple of children; but, if he had not
<PB N="8" REF="028632_0008_0FDA32D64EAED5B8">
been blinded by his ab&s;urd attachment, he might have beheld what every one el&s;e plainly perceiv|ed, that in the countenance of his French valet, and not in his own looking-gla&s;s, their re&s;em|blance was to be di&s;covered. Mon&s;ieur's features were large, and his face was the rouged bronze of his country; his ma&s;ter's unplea&s;ingly dime|nutive, and his countenance the palid hue of con|demned guilt. With this ba&s;e woman did Sini&s;|ter &s;pend mo&s;t of his time; and, though her fea|tures were coar&s;e, her &s;entiments gro&s;ly vulgar, and her voice har&s;h as the raven's; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible he could have loved her, had he beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;u&s;ceptible of love; by &s;ubmitting to the tyran|ny of his temper, and pretending to an exce&s;s of affection for his per&s;on, &s;he entertaining hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that her children would in the end po&s;&s;e&s;s Old|field Hall, in &s;pite even of his &s;on, who might full a victim to the di&s;&s;ipation into which &s;he had provided he &s;hould be tempted, while he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now making the tour of Europe.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a companion, with all his weakne&s;s, he was much too cunning to unbo&s;om him&s;elf. He had no appetite for the provi&s;ion that was &s;et before him; and, having laboured to drow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reflection, by &s;wallowing a plentiful quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brandy and water, he retired to his chamber.</P>
<P>It was in vain, however, that he endeavor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t: his eyes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than the &s;hadow of Harry Oldfield appeared before him. He opened them,
<PB N="9" REF="028632_0008_0FDA32D64EAED5B8">
fancy conducted to his ear &s;ounds of criminal accu&s;ation, and of menaced vengeance. He clo|&s;ed both his ears and eyes, yet voices &s;eemed to &s;peak from within him; and the cries of the &s;heep-&s;tealer's wife and children, now imploring pardon, and now reproaching him with &s;uperior guilt, while to his mind's eye they &s;eemed &s;hriek|ing around the agonized man, who was about to be launched into eternity; proved together too powerful for him; and leaping out of bed, with a loud cry he fell down in a &s;woon.</P>
<P>Though his hou&s;ekeeper lay in the next room, and neither &s;he nor Mon&s;ieur were a&s;leep, they did not think proper to hear him: weltering, therefore, in his blood, for he had cut his tem|ples by the fall, he continued till nature gave him &s;trength &s;ufficiently recruited to reach the bell; when he immediately gave an alarm, to which they knew the certain con&s;equence of being deaf.</P>
<P>Having put &s;ome bal&s;am to the wound, which appeared trifling, notwith&s;tanding the effu&s;ion of blood was great, his tender hou&s;ekeeper now af|fectionately intreated permi&s;&s;ion to &s;it up with him for the remainder of the night. But, tho' her pre&s;ence took off much of the horror he had before felt, it was in vain that he endeavored to procure &s;leep; and in a &s;tate of re&s;tle&s;s &s;tupefac|tion he continued till the welcome appearance of morning.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028632_0009_0FDA32D9E804FAD8">The morning, however, broke out with the &s;plendor of the proceeding day. The cloud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were heavy, there was a bri&s;k wind, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dawn was quickly overca&s;t. The rain &s;oon be+gan to de&s;cend; and, though not violent, &s;eem+ed likely to prove la&s;ting: &s;o that Sini&s;ter, in+&s;tead of taking an early ride, as he had intended according to his u&s;ual practice, was under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neco&s;&s;ity of remaining at home.</P>
<P>But the rain, which had prevented his ride could not prevent the wife of the unhappy male|factor and their &s;even children from vi&s;iting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tern pro&s;ecutor of their too anxious protector, and imploring him to &s;ign their petition for a pardon before the judge quitted the city. He had ju&s;t rai&s;ed to his lips the fir&s;t mor&s;al of his breakfa&s;t, when the whole groupe, having been refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion, knelt at his gate, and with their affecting cries began to realize what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had &s;o recently been tormented with by imagi+nation.</P>
<P>He began now to conceive, that the appear|ance of Harry Oldfield's gho&s;t the preceding e+vening&mdash;for &s;uch he had now made up in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mind it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be&mdash;was merely to wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him again&s;t putting to death a man who was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no means &s;o criminal as him&s;elf; and that, there|fore his peace of mind would return the moun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> he had forgiven this man. In fact there was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little for him to forgive; &s;ince he not lo&s;t a &s;in|gle &s;hilling on the occa&s;ion. The imprudent
<PB N="11" REF="028632_0009_0FDA32D9E804FAD8">
fellow was detected in &s;elling this &s;olitary &s;heep, which he had met with &s;traying in the road, at a time when he had neither money, nor work, nor food for his family. He had, therefore, for the fir&s;t time of his life, yielded to the tempta|tion; but he would not for the univer&s;e, have taken it home to his family, or have let them know that he had by improper means procured the value of a farthing. In this frame of mind, Sini&s;ter de&s;ired the petition might be brought in; and to the &s;urprize of the &s;ervants, who&s;e tears ran down their faces for joy, he immediately &s;igned it. At the tran&s;porting, but unexpected intelligence, the poor woman faiinted away; for a pardon had been promi&s;ed by the judge, pro|vided the pro&s;ecutor would &s;ign the petition: and, when &s;he recovered, the fervor with which &s;he prayed to Heaven for ble&s;&s;ings on her hu&s;|band's pre&s;erver, and the artle&s;s manner in which &s;he was joined by her little ones, had an effect far beyond any conception.</P>
<P>Sini&s;ter, having thus cheaply &s;atisfied his con|&s;cience, &s;pent the remainder of the day in chear|fulne&s;s; and, at night, enjoyed a more calm and delightful repo&s;e than he had for many years ex|perienced.</P>
<P>In the morning he ro&s;e early; and looking out at a window, while his hor&s;e was getting ready, what was his a&s;toni&s;hment, on perceiving the ve|ry boy i&s;&s;ue from a little &s;hed, who&s;e &s;hadow,
<PB N="12" REF="028632_0010_0FDA32DBABCE14B0">
as he was now fully per&s;uaded, had occa&s;ioned him &s;o much alarm!</P>
<P>He had but a few minutes to reflect on this in|cident, before he was informed that the hor&s;e waited; and, immediately mounting, he thought he would direct his ride to that part of the park in which he had lo&s;t &s;ight of the boy. Having proceeded about a quarter of a mile, he di&s;cri|ed him at a di&s;tance, near a wood on the verge of the park; and, calling to his &s;ervant&mdash;"Look there, (&s;aid he) is not that the boy you &s;aw the other evening?"&mdash;"Where, Sir?" replied the man, looking in a different direction. "There, blockhead!" cried his ma&s;ter, pointing to ju&s;t &s;pot. But it was too late, for the youth had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;t entered the wood; and the &s;ervant began to think his ma&s;ter's &s;en&s;es had taken leave of him.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing what trifles alarm a guilty mind! Sini&s;ter's happine&s;s was again fled; all his terrors returned. Yet the object that excited this commotion was but a child; a poor friendle&s;s child! who had a heart too tender to trample wantonly on a worm.</P>
<P>Young Harry had &s;een Sini&s;ter at the window; and he was per&s;uaded that he had been &s;een by him when he quitted the &s;hed. He now began to fear, that he had taken an unwelcome, and perhaps an unju&s;t liberty, in lodging without ex|pre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, where certainly any animal in the creation might ungrudgingly been &s;uffered to repo&s;e: anduch was the delicate propriety of
<PB N="13" REF="028632_0010_0FDA32DBABCE14B0">
his mind, that he would have di&s;dained even the &s;helter of a hedge, if he felt the &s;malle&s;t indica|tion that he might po&s;&s;ibly be acting wrong.</P>
<P>Alas! he could feelingly &s;ay, with the only "perfect Being" ever on earth&mdash;"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have ne&s;ts; but the &s;on of man hath not where to lay his head!"</P>
<P>For &s;everal days he remained concealed in the woods, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting merely on the nuts and berries he found there: and, each night, climbing a thick tree, he fa&s;tened his body, with a handker|chief, to one of the firme&s;t branches, where he fearle&s;sly repo&s;ed till awakened by the chear|ful harmony of his early and innocent neigh|bours.</P>
<P>Sini&s;ter, during all this time, was &s;uffering e|very horror of a mind awakened to a &s;en&s;e of it's guilt.

<P><PB N="16" REF="028632_0012_0FDA32E1FAE777C0">Sini&s;ter being retired to his chamber, the hou&s;ekeeper &s;oon began to admini&s;ter her con|&s;olation. She repre&s;ented the cruelty to him|&s;elf in &s;mothering any &s;ecret that oppre&s;&s;ed him, and mildly reproached his want of confidence in+ner &s;o long experienced affection. There was nothing, not even her life, that &s;he would he&s;i|tate to &s;acrifice for the dear object to whom &s;he had already forfeited what was to a woman of her honor and breeding &s;o much more precious than life it&s;elf. What would become of her, what would become of his &s;weet babes, if he gave way to &s;uch cau&s;ele&s;s but ruinous regrets! If he died, Heaven knew, they mu&s;t all go to the work-hou&s;e; for, to be &s;ure, his fine &s;on would &s;oon turn them out of doors, and perhaps not long have a hou&s;e over his own head! With this kind of language, to which he but little at|tended, &s;he contrived to keep her tongue in mo|tion for &s;ome hours; and he who was all the time pondering on the means by which he &s;hould ef|fectually get rid of the la&s;t heir of the hou&s;e of Oldfield, began to a&s;k what &s;he thought of Mon|&s;ieur. Con&s;cience ha&s;tily interpreting this que&s;|tion; &s;he tartly replied, that he was an ugly wretch, and that &s;he could never abide him. "I do not mean, (&s;ays Sini&s;ter) to a&s;k your opinion of his beauty: But do you think his fidelity can be depended on! Can he keep a &s;ecret?"&mdash;"O, yes! (replied &s;he, glad to find there was no jea|lou&s;y): I have tried him many and many's the

No, hang him! though he is certainly not hand|&s;ome, to give the man his due, I mu&s;t &s;ay, he is as fit to be tru&s;ted with &s;ecrets as any fellow I ever knew, and I have known many in my time."&mdash;"Not &s;o fa&s;t; not &s;o fa&s;t!

<P>She told Mon&s;ieur, in the morning, what had pa&s;&s;ed between her and her ma&s;ter; and he con|&s;ented, though with &s;ome reluctance, to under|take the ta&s;k. Accordingly, he &s;pent the whole of that day, in making minute enquiries after the youth. He even traced him to the little alehou&s;e, where he had been refre&s;hed; but the land|lord and his wife prote&s;ted they had &s;een nothing of him for &s;everal days, and they were anxious to know what could be become of him. They declared he was the gentle&s;t and be&s;t creature in the world: and they never loved &s;o well a child of their own, for they believed he was an angel. Mon&s;ieur now told them, that if he came again, he begged they would &s;end him word; and, if they would promi&s;e to keep the &s;ecret, he would tell
<PB N="18" REF="028632_0013_0FDA32E3AB877A78">
them the truth. The boy, he &s;aid, was his own &s;on; and had run away from his mother, in France, who was breaking her heart at his ab&s;ence. All he wanted was, to &s;ecure the young rogue, and &s;end him back to his mother, till his own father died; when he &s;hould return to his dear wife, and live like a gentleman, on his own family e&s;|tate. The good &s;ouls, who believed every &s;yl|lable Mon&s;ieur &s;aid, promi&s;ed to do as he had told them; and they would have religiou&s;ly kept their word, had Harry unfortunately furni&s;hed them with any opportunity. But Providence was plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of him in a different way.</P>
<P>He was, one morning, de&s;cending from a tree in which he had all night repo&s;ed, when he was perceived by an old man, &s;itting on the ground at a little di&s;tance, who was binding together a few &s;ticks, to form a &s;mall faggot. There was &s;omething wonderfully benign and attractive in the countenance of the old man: Who&s;e &s;ilver beard &s;wept his bo&s;om; and who&s;e head, though rendered bald by age, &s;till retained a few &s;cat|tered locks of &s;nowy hair. His whole form was manly; and his dre&s;s, though coar&s;e, clean and neat in the extreme. He was a man of whom no &s;tranger could he&s;itate to &s;ay, that he had &s;een more pro&s;perous days. Harry, though natural|ly diffident and di&s;tant, was attracted, as it were involuntarily towards the old man; who while the youth approached, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly in his
<PB N="19" REF="028632_0013_0FDA32E3AB877A78">
face, with a union of &s;urpri&s;e, of doubt, and of tran&s;port, no &s;ooner &s;aw features once &s;o famil|iar to his eye, than he ro&s;e on one knee, and ex|claimed&mdash;"Gracious Heaven, I am not deceiv|ed; this is &s;urely my dear young ma&s;ter! it mu&s;t, it mu&s;t be, Harry Oldfield!"</P>
<P>Harry acknowledged that his name was Old|field; and a few minutes acquaintance endeared them to each other. The good old man had in his youth been valet to Harry's grandfather. He afterwards rented for many years, a re&s;pectable farm, on the Oldfield e&s;tate, from which he was cruelly ejected by Sini&s;ter, who had laid &s;ix farms into one, and thus driven &s;o many families into di&s;tre&s;s and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>When the poor man under&s;tood the &s;ituation of Harry, from his &s;imple narrative, his aged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yes rained a &s;hower of tears; and he &s;obbed as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his heart were breaking. "O, my young ma&s;ter, (&s;aid he) live with me: I have a &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ottage which I can call my own; and I have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">od or two of ground, which I cultivate.

I and my little girl contrive to live comfortably enough." To this generous offer, Harry could only reply, that he believed Heaven had brought them together; and if it plea&s;ed the &s;ame graci|ous Power, he could wi&s;h nothing might ever di|vide them.</P>
<P>Harry lived for &s;ome weeks in this retreat; and, by the advice of the old man, they &s;eldom approached Sini&s;ter's grounds. He knew the malice and implacability of the wretch, by &s;ad experience; and he dreaded the lengths to which the villain might proceed again&s;t the heir of Old|field e&s;tate. They had, however been &s;een to|gether; and, one evening, ju&s;t after they had retired to re&s;t, three men in &s;oldiers cloaths came to the door and demanded admittance. The old man told them, from a &s;mall window, that his family were in bed; that he knew nothing of them; and that they could clearly have no bu&s;i|ne&s;s there. One of them replied, that they be|longed to a recruiting-party; and that, having come from Hereford, after a de&s;erter, whom he harboured, they were re&s;olved not to go away without him. The young man, they &s;wore, was about five and twenty: He was one of the fine&s;t fellows in their regiment, being full &s;ix feet without his &s;hoes; much &s;carred with the &s;mall pox; and had red hair: he was, therefore re+markable enough, and they were not to be de|ceived in the per&s;on, though they well knew h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> went by different names. Harry, the old man,
<PB N="21" REF="028632_0014_0FDA32E73173F538">
and his daughter, having &s;lipped on their cloaths, and agreeing there would be no harm in permit|ting the &s;oldiers to &s;earch for the per&s;on they de&s;cribed, the door was un&s;u&s;pectingly open|ed by Harry, whom two of the &s;oldiers immedi|ately dragged away, crying out&mdash;"This is him; this is him, &s;afe enough! I thought we &s;hould be too cunning for the old fox, and the young cub too!" The old man, in a &s;tate of di&s;traction, ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, and pur&s;ued after them; but it was with difficulty he could di&s;cover even the road they had taken. That di&s;covery how|ever in&s;pired him with hope; for he went a|cro&s;s the fields, of which they were clearly ig|norant, and was thus enabled to get into the pub|lic road, and porcure a&s;&s;i&s;tance from two or three farm-hou&s;es, full a quarter of an hour before they reached the end of the lane. Ten &s;tout men with guns and pitchforks, therefore, lay in am|bu&s;h for their arrival; and &s;uddenly bur&s;ting out &s;urrounded and di&s;armed the three villains, and &s;afely delivered Harry into the arms of his old friend. The fellows being thus taken and &s;ecured, &s;oon came to a confe&s;&s;ion: from which it appeared that Sini&s;ter's French valet had em|ployed and in&s;tructed them; and that they re|ceived twenty pounds a piece for undertaking the bu&s;ine&s;s, and where to have the&s;e &s;ums made up by five hundred whenever it &s;hould be com|pleated. They owned they were &s;mugglers, and not &s;oldiers; and the de&s;ign was fir&s;t to carry him
<PB N="22" REF="028632_0015_0FDA32E82A4EF2A8">
into Wales, and from thence to tran&s;port him to the continent, where he was to be left without a &s;hilling in his pocket, and con&s;equently there would have been no great chance of his ever get|ting back again. The old man went next day to Hereford, with the three &s;oldiers, and Harry Oldfield; and obtained from the maji&s;trates, a warrant for the apprehen&s;ion of Sini&s;ter, as well as his valet. But Mon&s;ieur had ju&s;t taken leave of Oldfield Hall; and his ma&s;ter had, a few hours before, &s;et out to appear before the bar of a &s;till more tremendous tribunal! It appeared that, for &s;ome days, either in &s;pite or in con&s;e|quence of his &s;kilful hou&s;ekeeper's infalible plai&s;|ter, a gangrene had evidently taken place; and, while &s;he and Mon&s;ieur were gone to in&s;truct the ruffians, old Sini&s;ter, beginning to &s;u&s;pect the truth, called his &s;ervants together, and taking his will, which contained a legacy to the hou&s;e|keeper and her children, of ten thou&s;and pounds, immediately thru&s;t it in the fire; declaring that the law would di&s;po&s;e of his property exactly as he wi&s;hed, by giving every &s;hilling to his &s;on. Notwith&s;tanding the injunctions of &s;ecrecy, this intelligence reached the ears of the copartners in iniquity, within half an hour after their return; and they accordingly took care, in the cour&s;e of the night, to make ample preparation for the e|vent. Long before daylight, every thing of va|lue, that was ea&s;y to be concealed, found its way to a di&s;tant &s;ecret depo&s;itory; and old Sini&s;ter,
<PB N="23" REF="028632_0015_0FDA32E82A4EF2A8">
who&s;e dreadful groans for a great part of the night kept mo&s;t of the family awake, was in the morning di&s;covered to have breathed his la&s;t. It was the intention of Mon&s;ieur, and his tender hou&s;ekeeper, to carry their depredations &s;till far|ther; but, in con&s;equence of a letter, which at noon arrived from young Sini&s;ter, mentioning that he had ju&s;t landed in England, and would be at Oldfield Hall the next day, they judged it mo&s;t expedient for Mon&s;ieur immediately to de|camp into Wales; whither &s;he was to follow him, the moment &s;he could prevail on young Si|ni&s;ter to make her the hand&s;ome legal &s;ettlement, &s;he entertained no doubt of obtaining from his generous and un&s;u&s;pecting di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Harry Sini&s;ter reached Oldfield Ca&s;tle the fol|lowing day; and &s;oon learned the mo&s;t import|ant particulars of the various tran&s;actions. For the mi&s;erable death of his wretched father&mdash;
<Q>"Some natural tears he dropp'd, but wip'd them &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P>But when he heard, from all tongues, the pi|teous &s;tory of Harry Oldfield's &s;ufferings; and, from the peru&s;al of &s;ome of his father's papers, became completely &s;atisfied that the e&s;tate had been obtained by the mo&s;t infernal practices; though a young man of a gay turn, and a &s;tran|ger to what are &s;oftened by the appelation of fa&s;hionable follies and youthful di&s;&s;ipation, he dropped on one knee, and with his expre&s;|&s;ive eyes lifted to Heaven, energetically depre|cated
<PB N="24" REF="028632_0016_0FDA32EA16AD2D00">
it's vengeance; and &s;olemnly vowed never to po&s;&s;e&s;s, what it was impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy, a &s;in|gle &s;hilling of that property which his father had, as he dreaded to reflect, purcha&s;ed at the price of his immortal &s;oul!</P>
<P>In this ju&s;t re&s;olve he was &s;trengthened by the Power to whom he had wi&s;ely appealed; and, filled with a tran&s;port, which no vicious gratifi|cation had for a moment ever conveyed to his bo&s;om, he ha&s;tened to fetch Harry Oldfield to the man&s;ion of his forefathers.</P>
<P>The interview which now took place, was a &s;pectacle for angels: pre&s;umptuous, indeed, mu&s;t be the pen which attempted to give it tongue. It was the cele&s;tial communication of kindred &s;ouls, purged from every terrene gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s; in which each look, each motion, each feature, each accent, and even &s;ilence it&s;elf, &s;poke a language beyond the highe&s;t flights of human rhetoric.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice to add, that from this moment all the wealth of old Sini&s;ter was at the di&s;|po&s;al of Harry Oldfield. Every argument that could be adduced proved in&s;ufficient to pre|vail on the &s;on to acceet the &s;malle&s;t portion of what he in&s;i&s;ted would, in his cu&s;tody, contam|inate every penny he might hereafter hone&s;tly acquire, and carry with it a cur&s;e to the late&s;t po&s;terity. It was by the&s;e participations, he was convinced that Heaven chiefly "vi&s;ited the &s;ins of the fathers, upon the children from generation
<PB N="25" REF="028632_0016_0FDA32EA16AD2D00">
to generation." Nor would he con&s;ent that a &s;hilling &s;hould be given to his father's infamous hou&s;ekeeper, which he in&s;i&s;ted would only be en|couraging vice; and &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with her children, to follow him who&s;e duty it was to &s;up|port them. It turned out, however, that Mon|&s;ieur had gone off for America, with the whole booty.</P>
<P>At his own earne&s;t reque&s;t, Harry Sini&s;ter was appointed to his father's original &s;ituation, as &s;teward of the e&s;tate; and never was that import|ant tru&s;t confided to more able or faithful hands. Harry Oldfield built for him a noble hou&s;e in his park; and, erecting another for his adored old man, he procured the widow of a worthy cler|gyman to educate the daughter: and, it is gen|erally thought, as he now u&s;ually calls her his little wife, that this good old dome&s;tic's daugh|ter, notwith&s;tanding her father's delicate &s;cru|ples and remon&s;trances, will probably become the happy partner of the Heir of the Hou&s;e of Old|field.</P>

<P>Patty A&s;hford's parents were two of tho&s;e thoughtle&s;s young people, who enter early into the cares of life, without &s;ufficiently reflecting on the con&s;equence. They knew, that their in|tentions were virtuous; and, whatever they might &s;uffer, they determined to &s;uffer together. Their union, though honorable, was a &s;tolen one; and Patty, before her entrance into life, betrayed the &s;ecret of her parents. They were both, on this di&s;covery, rendered de&s;titute of a home. Her father was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the uncle who had brought him up: her mother, by a rich, but cruel father; who cut her off with a &s;hilling, and left the whole of his property to her brother, whom his brutality had driven a|broad

<P>With a few &s;hillings in their pockets, and their whole wardrobe in a couple of handkerchiefs, they &s;et off they knew not whither. After tra|velling many miles, and furmounting innumera|ble hard&s;hips, a worthy farmer compa&s;&s;ionated their di&s;tre&s;s; employed the hu&s;band as a labour|er; and gave them a little &s;hed to live in, which their indu&s;try &s;oon rendered a comfortable re&s;i|dence. In this &s;hed Patty A&s;hford was born. But, as if life had been retained by the mother, only that &s;he might give it to her infant; the fa|ther was no &s;ooner told he had got a daughter, than it was added, he had lo&s;t his wife.

<P>The farmer was worthy, but he was not rich. His rent had been nearly doubled, by the offers of manopolizing neighbours, eager to "lay field to field:" and, with a heart feelingly alive to the &s;ufferings of others, he had often been plung|ed in difficulties which rendered him&s;elf a genu|ine object of compa&s;&s;ion.

<P>Little Patty, as &s;he grew up, was admired much for her beauty, but &s;till more for the ami|able mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition. Her bo&s;om was the &s;ent of all that is tender and good; and &s;he began to make con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the vari|ous dome&s;tic employments, though only about eleven years of age, when the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmer, who had &s;uffered by becoming &s;ecurity for a friend, had his goods &s;eized, and was him&s;elf &s;ent to the county-g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. This event broke his wife's heart; their &s;on was taken by a poor relation, for the rich would have nothing to do with a per&s;on &s;o extremely weak; and little Patty having no friend in the world, was conveyed to the pari&s;h work-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable place, &s;he remained untill a|bout fifteen; when &s;he was taken out by a lady, then on a vi&s;it to her relations in the neighbor|hood, but who had married in London, and who wanted, a neat girl to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028632_0018_0FDA32F1A1E63518">Poor Patty had been treated but indifferently by the unfeeling mercenaries who kept the poor-hou&s;e. She had been made to labour much, and permitted to eat but little: yet, at the thought of parting from tho&s;e with whom &s;he had been long accu&s;tomed to live, and probably reflecting on what &s;he knew of her pa&s;t hi&s;tory, &s;he &s;hed many tears.</P>
<P>Her mi&s;tre&s;s, however, was a woman of good character, and of a very affable di&s;po&s;ition. She took pains to comfort her; told her of the ma|ny fine things &s;he would &s;ee in town; how well prudent young women frequently did there; and above all cheared her by the reflection, that &s;he was going to the place which had given birth to her decea&s;ed parents. This was at once a &s;olace and a &s;hock. The gleam of &s;un&s;hine it convey|ed to her bo&s;om, was that of April; it darted through a gloomy cloud and was accompanied by a copious &s;hower of tears.</P>
<P>In her new &s;ituation, &s;he was univer&s;ally belo|ved. The children, in particular, were as fond of her as of their parents; and &s;he began to en|joy comfort, at lea&s;t, if not felicity. She could not but occa&s;ionally reflect on her lot, in being deprived of both parents at her birth; and the cruel circum&s;tances which had deprived her for ever from her kind fo&s;ter-father, who was all this time langui&s;hing in confinement. From the fir&s;t moment in which &s;he could pen a letter,
<PB N="30" REF="028632_0019_0FDA32F30DBC9DE8">
&s;he had corre&s;ponded with him. She now &s;ent him every &s;hilling &s;he could &s;crape together, and his truly parental letters were her chief con&s;ola|tions. He murmured at nothing; he was thank|ful for every thing: and &s;till, with pious and a patient eye, contemnplated hope through the bars of his pri&s;on. "Alas! alas! &s;hould any pri&s;on in a civilized country confine &s;uch a man?"</P>
<P>Patty had lived two years in town, when her mi&s;tre&s;s, who had long been ill, died in a de|cline. This was a new calamity: it was, in|deed, a greater one than &s;he imagined. Her ma|&s;ter had for &s;ome time ca&s;t a criminal eye on her beauties; and &s;carcely had his decea&s;ed lady been a month depo&s;ited in her tomb, when his cruel intentions became abundantly manife&s;t even to the un&s;u&s;picious innocent who&s;e de&s;truction he meditated. On the fir&s;t in&s;ult, &s;he prudently ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e; and nothing could ever induce her again to enter it. She &s;ent for her cloaths, which the bounty of her mi&s;tre&s;s had made con&s;iderable, as &s;oon as &s;he had taken a lodging; and, with the &s;mall part of her wages due, re&s;olved to live with the greate&s;t frugality, till &s;he &s;hould be able to procure another place. What &s;he felt, on contemplating her forlorn &s;tate, is ea&s;ier conceived than expre&s;&s;ed; but the out|rage &s;he had &s;uffered, with the reflection of what &s;he had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped, brought on a fever.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="028632_0019_0FDA32F30DBC9DE8">A nur&s;e was now nece&s;&s;ary, and a nur&s;e was obtained. But this cruel wretch, while the poor unhappy girl lay in&s;en&s;ible, purloined mo&s;t of her little property; &s;o that on her reco|very, &s;he had &s;carcely a decent change of appa|rel; and the apothecary, as well as her landlady, though no &s;trangers to her misfortunes, were both clamorous for their bills. Thus was this poor young creature, by the brutality of him who&s;e children &s;he was rearing not only to health but to virtue, torn from every gleam of comfort, and plunged in the depths of di&s;tre&s;s. She was &s;oon in&s;tructed in the &s;hocking practice of pledg|ing her cloaths for trifling &s;ums, to appea&s;e her unfeeling creditors; and it now became nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of &s;u&s;tenance. Ten days did &s;he pa&s;s with no other food than bread and water, before &s;he would con&s;ent to part with the only gown &s;he had that was not on her back; nor could &s;he even then have been brought to acqui|e&s;ce, but that her landlady &s;ignificantly intima|ted, that &s;he could not pay her rent with &s;uch lodgers. It was therefore the dread of being hou&s;ele&s;s, more than that of death, which finally prevailed; nor did a mor&s;al thus dearly purcha&s;|ed ever reach her lips, that was not fir&s;t bathed with her tears. At length, all that mode&s;ty could &s;pare, was by degrees di&s;po&s;ed of; and it was &s;ugge&s;ted by her landlady, that &s;he mu&s;t part even with mode&s;ty it&s;elf. The &s;pecious ar|guments &s;he u&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the value of virtue,
<PB N="32" REF="028632_0020_0FDA32F67044DF60">
were lo&s;t on her mi&s;erable inmate; who petrified with horror at her infamous propo&s;al; became in&s;tantly motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue. This dreadful &s;hock co&s;t her another &s;it of illne&s;s; in which &s;he langui&s;hed without food, without medicine, and without attendance. Nature, or rather the God of Nature did every thing for her. She recover|ed &s;lowly; but it was &s;oon enough to be told, that &s;he mu&s;t eat the bread of infamy, as ten thou&s;and women, once her betters, every day did, or be content to rot in a pri&s;on, where &s;he would, after all, no doubt, &s;uffer by compul&s;ion, the evil &s;he &s;o greatly dreaded.</P>
<P>Partly by per&s;ua&s;ion, and partly by force, was this mi&s;erable creature, tottering with her own weight, led out to the &s;treet, in the gloom of the evening, and told that &s;he mu&s;t bring money, or not expect re-admi&s;&s;ion. As the door clo&s;ed up|on her, &s;he wrung her hands in agony; but the fountains of grief refu&s;ed to flow. Her &s;oul was poured out to Heaven; and &s;he prayed with fer|vor to be delivered from life's dire&s;t calamity. But, alas! &s;he &s;eemed de&s;tined to experience ev|ery horror. The thunder began to roll, and the lightning fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed around her. The heavy clouds, thus divided, poured down in torrents: &s;he dur&s;t not return home; a dark unfrequented pa&s;&s;age at a little di&s;tance, &s;he recollected to have &s;een, and thither &s;he ha&s;tened for &s;helter. It was at the &s;ame moment occupied by a plain man; who &s;ee|ing her a cleanly looking girl, and taking her

for a common pro&s;titute, acco&s;ted her in lan|guage which happily &s;he did not comprehend; and to which &s;he returned no an&s;wer, but &s;eemed inclined rather to brave the &s;torm, than continue in &s;uch company. He &s;eized her with ardour, but not with roughne&s;s; and began to addre&s;s her in more &s;oothing accents. But her trembling and agitated frame, and her pathetic voice, &s;oon convinced him that &s;he was no daughter of infa|my; and, though a man of frailties, he would not for the univer&s;e have loaded his &s;oul with the guilt of a deliberate &s;eduction. He told her frankly what was his fir&s;t de&s;ign, but added, that he would endeavor to make her amends for the in&s;olence of his intentions. As the &s;torm &s;till continued, he began to enquire into her hi&s;|tory; of which &s;he candidly told him all &s;he knew. He appeared greatly affected by her nar|rative; and &s;oothed her with the attentions of a parent. She had no &s;ooner brought her &s;ad tale to a conclu&s;ion, than he exclaimed&mdash;"And is not your name Patty A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ford?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir!"</P>

<P>She became lifele&s;s in his arms; and it was long before &s;he was re&s;tored to animation. The

<P>In a few days, &s;he began to recover health; and her uncle being a widower, and having lo&s;t all his children, a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he &s;hould, at his death, have the whole of his very ample for|tune.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they agreed to vi&s;it in&s;tant|ly the poor farmer, and liberate him from his cruel confinement.</P>
<P>They found him with his Bible before him; and his &s;on by his &s;ide, an elegant and manly youth. Patty could not refrain from embracing them both: &s;he knew, &s;he &s;aid, their worth; and with her uncle's permi&s;&s;ion, if the young man had no objection, he &s;hould be her hu&s;band.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEING on a tour to the North, I was one evening arre&s;ted in my progre&s;s at the en|trance of a &s;mall hamlet, by breaking the fore|wheel of my ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ton. This accident rendering it impracticable for me to proceed to the next town, from which I was now &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant, I directed my &s;teps to a &s;mall cottage, at the door of which, in a woodbine arbor, &s;at a man of about &s;ixty, who was &s;olacing him&s;elf with a pipe. In the front of his hou&s;e was affixed a &s;mall board, which I conceived to contain an in|timation, that travellers might there be accom|modated. Addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf therefore to the old man, I reque&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he readily granted; but on my mentioning an inten|tion of remaining at his hou&s;e all night, he re|gretted that it was not in his power to receive me, and the more &s;o, as there was no inn in the village. It was not till now that I di&s;covered my
<PB N="36" REF="028632_0022_0FDA32F96BFDFA68">
error concerning the board over the door, which contained a notification, that there was taught that u&s;eful art, of which, if we credit Mrs. Bad|deley's Memoirs, a certain noble lord was &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant. In &s;hort, my friend proved to be the &s;choolma&s;ter, and probably the &s;ecreaty to the hamlet. Affairs were in this &s;ituation when the Vicar made his appearance. He was one of the mo&s;t venerable figures I had ever &s;een; his time-&s;ilvered locks &s;haded his temples, whil&s;t the lines of misfortune were, alas! but too vi&s;ible in his countenance. Time had &s;oftened, but could not efface them. On &s;eeing my broken equipage, he addre&s;&s;ed me; and when he began to &s;peak, his countenance was illumined by a &s;mile.&mdash;"I pre&s;ume, &s;ir, &s;aid he, that the accident you have ju&s;t experienced, will render it impo&s;&s;ible for you to proceed. Should that be the ca&s;e, you will be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for lodgings, the place affording no accommodations for travellers, as my pari&s;ho|ners are neither willing nor able to &s;upport an alehou&s;e; and as we have few travellers, we have little need of one; but if you will accept the be&s;t accommodation my cottage affords, it is much at your &s;ervice." After expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e I en|tertained of his goodne&s;s, I joyfully accepted &s;o de&s;irable an offer. As we entered the hamlet, the &s;un was gilding with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eparting beams the vil|age &s;pire, whil&s;t a gentle breeze refre&s;hed the weary hinds, who, &s;eated be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th the venerable oaks that over&s;hadowed their cottages, were re|po&s;ing

them&s;elves after the labours of the day, and li&s;tening attentively to the tale of an old &s;oldier, who, like my&s;elf, had wandered thus far, and was now di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for a lodging. He had been in &s;everal actions, in one of which he had lo&s;t a leg: and was now, like many other brave fel|lows,</P>
<LG>
<L>"&mdash;Doom'd to beg</L>
<L>"His bitter bread thro' realms his valor &s;av'd."</L>
</LG>
<P>My kind ho&s;t invited me to join the croud, and li&s;ten to his tale. With this reque&s;t I readily complied. No &s;ooner did we make our appear|ance, than I attracted the attention of every one. The appearance of a &s;tranger in a hamlet, two hundred miles from the capital, is generally pro|ductive of &s;urpri&s;e; and every one examines the next comer with the mo&s;t attentive ob&s;ervation. So wholly did my arrival engro&s;s the villagers, that the veteran was obliged to defer the conti|nuation of his narrative, till their curio&s;ity &s;hould be gratified. Every one there took an opportu|nity of te&s;tifying the good will they bore my ve|nerable ho&s;t, by offering him a &s;eat on the gra&s;s. The good man and my&s;elf were &s;oon &s;eated, and the brave veteran re&s;umed his narrative, in the following words:&mdash;"After, continued he, I had been intoxicated, I was carried before a ju&s;tice, who was intimate with the captain, at who&s;e re+que&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="028632_0023_0FDA32FEAD48DD70">
he atte&s;ted me before I had &s;ufficiently re|covered my &s;en&s;es to &s;ee the danger I was encountering. In the morning when I came to my&s;elf, I found I was in cu&s;tody of three or four &s;oldiers, who, after telling me what had happened, in &s;pite of all I could &s;ay, carried me to the next town, without permitting me to take leave of one of my neighbors. When they reached the town it was market day, and I &s;aw &s;everal of the people from our village, who were all &s;orry to hear what had happened, and endeavored to procure my relea&s;e, but in vain, after taking an affecting leave of my neighbors, I was marched to Port&s;mouth, together with 100 more, and there embarked for the coa&s;t of Af|rica. During the voyage, mo&s;t of our number died, or became &s;o enfeebled by &s;ickne&s;s, as to make them unfit for &s;ervice. This was owing partly to the climate, partly to the want of wa|ter, and to confinement in the &s;hip. When we reached the coa&s;t of Africa, we were landed, and experienced every po&s;&s;ible cruelty from our offi|cers. At length, however, a man of war arriv|ed, who had lo&s;t &s;everal marines in a late action, and I, with &s;ome others, was &s;ent on board to &s;erve in that &s;tation. Soon after we put to &s;ea, we fell in with a French man of war. In the action I lo&s;t my leg, and was near being thrown overboard; but the humanity of the clergyman pre&s;erved my life, and on my return to England procured my di&s;charge. I applied for the Chel|&s;ea
<PB N="39" REF="028632_0023_0FDA32FEAD48DD70">
bounty, but it was refu&s;ed me, becau&s;e I lo&s;t my limb when acting as a marine: and as I was not a regular marine, I was not entitled to any protection from the Admiralty: Therefore I am reduced to live on the good will of tho&s;e who pity my misfortunes."</P>
<P>The village clock now &s;triking eight, the worthy Vicar ro&s;e, and &s;lipping &s;omething in the old man's hand, de&s;ired me to follow him. At our departure the villagers promi&s;ed to take care of the old man. We returned the farewell civilities of the ru&s;tics, and directed our &s;teps to the vicarage. It was &s;mall, with a thatched roof. The front was entirely covered with woodbine and honey&s;uckle, which &s;trongly &s;cent|ed the circumambient air. A grove of ancient oaks, that &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, ca&s;t a &s;olemn &s;hade over, and pre&s;erved the verdure of the ad|jacent lawn, through the mid&s;t of which ran a &s;mall brook, that gently murmured as it flowed. This, together with the bleating of the &s;heep, the lowing of the herds, the village murmurs, and the di&s;tant barkings of the tru&s;ty curs, who were now entering on their office as guardians of the hamlet, formed a concert, at lea&s;t equal to that on Tottenham-court-road. On entering the wicket we were met by a little girl of &s;ix years old. Her dre&s;s was &s;imple, but elegant; and her appearance &s;uch at &s;poke her de&s;tined for a higher &s;phere. As &s;oon as &s;he had informed her grandfather that &s;upper was ready, &s;he dropped
<PB N="40" REF="028632_0024_0FDA3304526E27A8">
a curte&s;ey, and retired. I delayed not a moment to congratulate the good old man on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o great a trea&s;ure. He replied, but with a &s;igh, and we entered the hou&s;e, where every thing was di&s;tingui&s;hed with an air of elegant &s;implici|ty that &s;urpri&s;ed me. On our entrance, he in|troduced me to his wife; a woman turned of for|ty, who, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great remains of beauty, and had much the appearance of a wo|man of fa&s;hion. She received me with ea&s;y po|litene&s;s, and regretted that &s;he had it not in her power to entertain me better. I reque&s;ted her not to di&s;tre&s;s me with unnece&s;&s;ary apologies, and we &s;at down to &s;upper. The little angel, who welcomed us at the door, now &s;eating her|&s;elf oppo&s;ite to me, afforded me an opportunity of contemplating one of the fine&s;t faces I had ever beheld. My worthy ho&s;t, ob&s;erving how much I was &s;truck with her appearance, directed my at|tention to a picture which hung over the mantle. It was a &s;triking likene&s;s of my little neighbor, only on a larger &s;cale. That, &s;ir, &s;aid he, is Harriet's mother. Do you not think there is a va&s;t re&s;emblance? To this I a&s;&s;ented, when the old man put up a prayer to Heaven, that &s;he might re&s;emble her mother in every thing but her unhappy fate. He then &s;tarted another topic of conver&s;ation, without gratifying the curio&s;ity he had excited concerning the fate of Harriet's mo|ther, for whom I had already felt my&s;elf much intere&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="028632_0024_0FDA3304526E27A8">Supper being removed, after chatting &s;ome time, my worthy ho&s;t conducted me to my bed-chamber, which was in the ground-floor, and lined with je&s;&s;emin, that was conducted in at the windows. After wi&s;hing me good night, he re|tired, leaving me to re&s;t. The beauty of the &s;cenery, however, and my u&s;ual propen&s;ity to walk by moon-light, induced me to leave my fragrant cell. When I &s;allied forth, the moon was darting forth her temperated rays through the &s;hade that &s;urrounded the cottage, tipping the tops of the venerable oaks with &s;ilver. Af|ter taking a turn or two on the lawn, I wander|ed to the &s;pot,</P>
<P>"Where the rude forefathers of the hamlet &s;lept."</P>
<P>It was &s;mall, and for the mo&s;t part &s;urrounded with yew trees of an ancient date, beneath who&s;e &s;olemn &s;hade many generations had mouldered in the du&s;t. No &s;ooner did I enter, than my at|tention was caught by a pillar of white marble, placed on the &s;ummit of a &s;mall eminence, the ba&s;e of which was &s;urrounded with honey&s;uckles and woodbines, whil&s;t a large willow over&s;ha|dowed the pillar. As I was with attention pe|ru&s;ing the epitaph, I was not a little alarmed by the approach of a figure, cloathed in a long robe. The apparition continued advancing to|wards me with a &s;low a &s;tep, and its eyes fixed on
<PB N="42" REF="028632_0025_0FDA33048AF2A490">
the ground, which prevented it ob&s;erving me till we were within ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of each other. Great was my wonder at recognizing my worthy ho&s;t in this &s;ituation; nor was his a&s;toni&s;hment le&s;s at finding his gue&s;t thus courting the appearance of goblins and faries. After each had expre&s;&s;ed the &s;urpi&s;e he felt, I proceeded to enquire who&s;e du&s;t was there en&s;hrined? To my que&s;tions he returned an&s;wer&mdash;There, &s;ir, &s;leeps Harriet's mother, an innocent, but unfortunate woman. Pardon me, &s;ir, &s;aid he, if for a moment I in|dulge my &s;orrow, and bedew my Harriet's grave with tears&mdash;a tribute that I often pay her much lov'd memory, when the re&s;t of the world are lo&s;t in &s;leep. Here he pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed much agitated. At length he reque&s;ted my permi&s;&s;ion to defer the recital of Harriet's woes till the next day, as he found him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of proceeding in the painful detail. To this propo&s;al I readily acceded, and we returned home. I retired to my room, but every attempt to procure &s;leep proved ineffectual. Harriet had &s;o wholly occupied my thoughts, that no moment of the night was &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed. At length, "when &s;oared the warbling lark on high," I left my couch, and rejoined my worthy land|lord, who was bu&s;ily employed in the arrange|ment of his garden. Though I declined men|tioning the &s;ubject of our la&s;t night's adventure, yet he &s;aw the marks of anxious expectation in my countenance, and proceeded to gratify the
<PB N="43" REF="028632_0025_0FDA33048AF2A490">
curio&s;ity he had in&s;pired. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;aid he, before I proceed to relate the woes that befel my daughter, to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of my own life.&mdash;Six and twenty years ago, Mrs. &mdash; came hither for the benefit of her health, the air being recommended as highly &s;alubrious. On her arrival, &s;he gave out that &s;he was the daughter of a clergyman, who was lately dead, and had left her in narrow circum&s;tances. I thought it my duty to vi&s;it her, and offer her a|ny little attention in my power. She received me with politene&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to culti|vate my acquaintance. I continued to repeat my vi&s;its for &s;ome time without &s;u&s;pecting that there was any thing particular in her hi&s;tory, till one morning I found her in tears reading a letter &s;he had ju&s;t received. On my entrance &s;he gave it to me: it contained a notfication from Lord B&mdash;'s agent, that her u&s;ual remittances would no longer be continued. On opening this letter, I was led to &s;uppo&s;e that her connexion with Lord B&mdash; was not of the mo&s;t honorable nature. But all my &s;u&s;picion vani&s;hed on her producing &s;everal let|ters from Lord B&mdash; to her mother, with whom he had been long connected.&mdash;From the&s;e letters I learnt, that Mrs.&mdash; was the daughter of Lord B&mdash; by Mi&s;s M&mdash;, &s;i&s;ter to a Scotch baronet, whom he had &s;educed and &s;upported during the remainder of her life. But he had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;eems, determined to withdraw his protection from the fruit of their connexion. Mrs. &mdash;

declared &s;he new not what &s;tep to take, as her fi|nances were nearly exhau&s;ted. I endeavored to comfort her, a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he &s;hould com|mand every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power:&mdash;On hearing this &s;he &s;eemed a little &s;atisfied, and became more compo&s;ed. After fitting with her &s;ome time, I returned home to con&s;ider in what manner I might mo&s;t ea&s;ily afford protection to the young or|phan, who&s;e whole dependence was on my &s;up|port.&mdash;If I took her home to live with me, as I was unmarried, it would give offence to my pa|ri&s;hioners.</P>
<P>My income was too confined to admit of my affording her a &s;eperate e&s;tabli&s;hment. Thus circum&s;tanced, I determined to offer her my hand. You will, no doubt, &s;ay it was rather an imprudent &s;tep for a man who had &s;een his fortieth year to connect him&s;elf with youth and beauty: but as my brother was then living, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to render her the lea&s;t a&s;|&s;i&s;tance on any other plan. She received my pro|po&s;al with grateful &s;urpri&s;e, and accepted it without he&s;itation.&mdash;In a few days we were mar|ried, and have now lived together &s;ix and twen|ty years in a &s;tate, the felicity of which has never been interrupted by tho&s;e di&s;cordant jars which are &s;o frequently the concomitants of ma|trimony: though, alas! our peace has received a mortal wound from one, the bare mention of who&s;e name fills me with horror!

me ble&s;&s;ed with the hand of Emily, my happi|ne&s;s received an important addition, by the birth of a daughter, who inherited all her mother's charms. It is &s;uperfluous to add, that &s;he was equally the idol of both her parents; and as &s;he was the only fruit of our marriage, &s;he became every day a greater favorite. My wife had re|ceived &s;uch an education as rendered her fully capable of accompli&s;hing her daughter in a man|ner far &s;uperior to any thing her &s;ituation requi|red, or perhaps could ju&s;tify. To this agreeable employment, however, &s;he devoted her whole time, and when Harriet had reached her eigh|teenth year, &s;he was in every re&s;pect a highly accompli&s;hed woman. She was become what that picture repre&s;ents her. With an amiable temper and gentle manners, &s;he was the idol of the village. Hitherto &s;he had experienced a &s;tate of felicity unknown in the more exalted &s;tations of life uncon&s;cious, alas! of the ills that await|ed her future years.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance I proceed in the melan|choly narrative.&mdash;One evening, as a young man, attended by a &s;ervant, was pa&s;&s;ing through the village, his hor&s;e &s;tartled, and threw him. Hap|pening to be on the &s;pot at the time, I offered every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, and conveying him to my cottage, di&s;patch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d his &s;ervant in que&s;t of a &s;urgeon, who declared our patient was not in any danger, but recommended it to him to delay
<PB N="46" REF="028632_0027_0FDA330AB3FC3A40">
his departure for a day or two. His health, however, or rather his love, did not admit of his travelling for near a fortnight; daring which time he e&s;tabli&s;hed his intere&s;t with Harriet by the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and unremitting attention to her &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;hes. When about to depart, he re|que&s;ted leave to repeat his vi&s;it on his return from his intended tour, dropping, at the &s;ame time, &s;ome di&s;tant hints of his affection for Har|riet, to whom &s;he was by no means indifferent.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash; (for &s;o our gue&s;t was named) inform|ed us, previous to his departure, that he had a &s;mall independent fortune; but that from a di&s;|tant relation he had con&s;iderable expectation.&mdash; After bidding an affectionate adieu to Harriet, he &s;et out on his intended tour which la&s;ted for a month.</P>
<P>During the time of Mr. H&mdash;'s ab&s;ence, Harriet appeared pen&s;ive; and I ob&s;erved with pain, that he had made no &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. At length Mr. H&mdash; returned, and Harriet's reception of him left us no room to doubt her attachment. During his &s;econd vi&s;it he was very affiduous to &s;ecure the favour of all the family: with Harriet he ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded; nor was Mrs T&mdash; nor my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;like him. His manners were elegant, and his wit lively. At length he obtained from Harriet the promi&s;e of her hand, provided her parents &s;hould not object. Hitherto I had never been induced to make any inquiries concerning his circum&s;tances and cha|racter.
<PB N="47" REF="028632_0027_0FDA330AB3FC3A40">
Now, however, by his direction, I ap|plied to a Mr. E&mdash;ns, a clergyman of his ac|quaintance. This gentleman, now in an exalted &s;tation in the church, then chaplin to Lord C&mdash;, informed me, that Mr. H&mdash; was in every re&s;pect a de&s;irable march for my daughter; and that whenever his cou&s;in &s;hould die, he would be en|abled to maintain her in affluence and &s;plendor; he added, that his character was unexceptionable. Little &s;u&s;pecting the villainous part Mr. E&mdash;ns was acting, I readily con&s;ented to the propo&s;ed union, and performed the ceremony my&s;elf. Mr. H&mdash; reque&s;ted that their marriage might be kept a &s;ecret, till the birth of a &s;on and heir. This propo&s;al rather alarmed me, but it was too late to retreat, and knowing no one in the great world, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, previous to the marriage, to procure any account of Mr. H&mdash;, but &s;uch as his friend cammunicated to me. Thus circum&s;tanced, I could only con&s;ent; and as Har|riet readily adopted every propo&s;al that came from one &s;he &s;o tenderly loved, the matter was finally agreed on.</P>
<P>After &s;taying a few days, he &s;et off for Lon|don, but &s;oon returned, and pa&s;&s;ed the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rinter with us; and in the &s;pring Harriet was de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivered of that little girl you &s;o much admire. I now pre&s;&s;ed him to acknowledge my daughter as his wife. To this he an&s;wered, Had &s;he brought him a &s;on he would readily have complied with my reque&s;t; but that his cou&s;in was &s;o great an

oddity, that he could not bear the idea (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion) "of having his fortune lavi&s;hed in a milliner's &s;hop:" But, added he, if you in|&s;i&s;t upon it, I will now ri&s;k the lo&s;s of all his for|tune, and introduce my Harriet to his pre&s;ence. Harriet, however, again interfered, and de&s;ired that Mr. H&mdash; might not be forced into mea&s;ures that might in the end prove de&s;tructive of his fu|ture pro&s;pect, and induce him to regret the day he ever &s;aw her. The&s;e arguments prevailed, and Mr. H&mdash; was &s;uffered to continue as a member of the family without any farther notice being taken of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In this manner had three years elap&s;ed, undi|&s;tingui&s;hed by any remarkable event, Mr. H&mdash; generally pa&s;&s;ing half a year with us, and the remainder in London, attending, as he &s;aid on his cou&s;in; when one day, as he was &s;itting with us at dinner, a chai&s;e and four drove up to the hou&s;e. The &s;ervants enquired for Mr. H&mdash;, and on hearing he was there, opened the carriage-door. A gentleman, dre&s;&s;ed like an officer, jumped out, followed by a lady in a travelling dre&s;s; they ru&s;hed immediately into the room. Their appearance amazed us; but Mr. H&mdash; be|trayed the mo&s;t vi&s;ible marks of con&s;ternation. The lady appeared to be about thirty. She was a woman by no means de&s;titute of per&s;onal char <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

<PB N="94" REF="028632_0028_0FDA330C2A053B90">
by &s;triking her innocent rival. On &s;eeing this, an old &s;ervant of mine &s;eized the lady, and forcibly turned her out of the hou&s;e, then fa&s;tened the door. It was not till now that we perceived the ab|&s;ence of Mr. H&mdash;, who had, it &s;eems, retired with the lady's companion. Whil&s;t we were &s;till lo&s;t in amazement at the tran&s;action we had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;|ed, we were alarmed to the highe&s;t pitch by the report of a pi&s;tol. Harriet in&s;tantly fainted. Whil&s;t Mrs. T&mdash; was recovering her, I flew to the &s;pot from whence the &s;ound proceeded, and there found Mr. H&mdash; weltering in his blood, with a pi|&s;tol lying by him. I approached, and found him &s;till &s;en&s;ible. He informed me, that the lady's brother and he had fought, and that &s;eeing him fall, they had both e&s;caped as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. I in&s;tantly procured a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and conveyed him to the hou&s;e, where he was put to bed, and a &s;ur|geon was &s;ent for. Mean time, Harriet had &s;ev|eral fits, and we were apprehen&s;ive that the hour of her fate was approaching. On the arrival of the &s;urgeon, he declared the wound Mr. H&mdash; had received would probably prove mortal, and recommended the arrangement of his affairs. Mr. H&mdash; received the news with great agony, and de&s;ired that I might be left alone with him. No &s;ooner was this reque&s;t granted, than he ad+re&s;&s;ed me in the following terms:</P>
<P>"In me, &s;ir, behold the mo&s;t unfortunate, and, alas! the mo&s;t guilty of men. The lady,
<PB N="50" REF="028632_0029_0FDA330FE82348A8">
who&s;e ill-timed vi&s;it has lo&s;t me my life, is&mdash;I tremble to pronouce the word&mdash;my wife! (See|ing me pale with horror, he proceeded.) No wonder, &s;ir, that you &s;hould behold with horror one who has repaid <HI>unbounded ho&s;pitality by unequal|led villainy.</HI> The bare remembrance of my own guilt di&s;tracts me. The awful hour is now fa&s;t appreaching, when I mu&s;t receive my final doom from that Heaven who&s;e laws I have &s;o daringly violated. To redre&s;s the injuries I have com|mitted, is, alas! impo&s;&s;ible. My death will be an atonement by no means &s;ufficient. I cannot, however, leave this world till you &s;hall be inform|ed, that ten thou&s;and pounds, the whole of my property that is at my di&s;po&s;al, has long ago been transferred by me into the hands of tru&s;tees for the benefit of my much-injured Harriet, and her unhappy infant. In my own defence I have nothing to urge. Suffer me only to remark, that my misfortune aro&s;e from the avarice of my father, who forced me into a marriage with the woman you lately &s;aw, and who&s;e brother has been the in&s;trument in the hand of Providence to inflict on me the doom I &s;o much merited. If po&s;&s;ible, conceal from Harriet that I was married. Picture, for her &s;ake, an innocent deception, and tell her that I was only engaged to that lady. This will contribute to promote her repo&s;e, and the deception may po&s;&s;ibly plead the merit of prolonging a life &s;o dear to you. For the ele|vated mind of my Harriet would never &s;urvive
<PB N="51" REF="028632_0029_0FDA330FE82348A8">
the fatal di&s;covery of my villainy. But, oh! when my unhappy child &s;hall a&s;k the fate of him who gave her being, in pity draw a veil over that guilt which can &s;carcely hope to obtain the pardon of Heaven."</P>
<P>There he cea&s;ed, and uttering a &s;hort prayer, expired. Happily for Harriet, &s;he continued in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility for three days, during which time I had the body removed to a neigh|boring hou&s;e, there to wait for interment. Having addre&s;&s;ed a letter to Mr. H&mdash;'s agent in town, he &s;ent orders for the body to be removed to the family-burying-place, where it was accordingly interred. Harriet recovered by &s;low degrees from the happy in&s;en&s;ibility, into which the death of Mr. H&mdash; had plunged her. Her grief became &s;ilent and &s;ettled. Groans and exclamations now gave way to &s;ighs, and the bitter tears of de&s;ponding grief. She &s;eldom or ever &s;poke, but would cry for hours together o|ver her haple&s;s infant, then call on the &s;hade of her departed Henry, little &s;u&s;pecting the irrepa|rable injury he had done her. It was with infi|nite anxiety I beheld the decline of Harriet's health. Prone as we ever are to hope what we ardently de&s;ire, I now de&s;paired of her recove|ry. Whil&s;t in a &s;tate of hopele&s;s inactivity, I was doomed to witne&s;s the lingering death of my lamented Harriet, I received a vi&s;it from an old friend. On his arrival I allotted him the apart|ment formerly occupied by Mr. H&mdash; and Harri+et.

<P>****** IT was evening when Wolkmar and his dog, almo&s;t &s;pent with fatigue, de&s;cended one of the mountains in Switzerland: the &s;un was dilated in the horizon, and threw a tint of rich crim&s;on over the waters of a neigh|bouring like; on each &s;ide rocks of varied form, their green heads glowing in the beam, were,
<PB N="54" REF="028632_0031_0FDA3315F4A88B88">
&s;warded with &s;hrubs that hung feathering from their &s;ummits, and at intervals was heard the ru&s;h|ing of a troubled &s;tream.</P>
<P>Amid this &s;cenery, our traveller, far from any habitation, wearied, and uncertain of the road, &s;ought for &s;ome excavation in the rocks, where|in he might repo&s;e him&s;elf; and having at length di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;ituation, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep upon &s;ome withered leaves. His dog &s;at watching at his feet, a &s;mall bundle of linen and a &s;taff were placed be&s;ide him, and the red ray of the declin|ing &s;un, having pierced through the &s;hrubs that concealed the retreat, gleamed on the languid features of his beloved ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>And long be thy re&s;t, O Wolkmar! may &s;leep fit plea&s;ant on thy &s;oul! Unhappy man! war hath e&s;tranged thee from thy native village; war, unnatural war, &s;natched thee from thy Fanny and her infant. Where art thou, be&s;t of wives? thy Wolkmar lives! 'twas error &s;pread his death. Thou fled'&s;t; thy beauty caught the eye of pow|er; thou fled'&s;t with thy infant and thy aged fa|ther. Unhappy woman? thy hu&s;band &s;eeketh thee over the wilds of Switzerland. Long be thy re&s;t, O Wolkmar! may &s;leep &s;it plea&s;ant on thy &s;oul!</P>
<P>Yet not long did Wolkmar re&s;t; &s;tarting, he beheld the dog, who, &s;eizing his coat, had
<PB N="55" REF="028632_0031_0FDA3315F4A88B88">
&s;hook it with violence; and having thoroughly awakened him, whining, licked his face, and &s;prang through the thicket. Wolkmar, eagerly following, di&s;cerned at &s;ome di&s;tance a man gent|ly walking down the declivity of the oppo&s;ite hill, and his own dog running with full &s;peed to|wards him. The &s;un yet threw athwart the vale rays of a blood-red hue, the &s;ky was over|ca&s;t, and a few big round drops ru&s;tled through the drooping leaves. Wolkmar &s;at him down, the dog now fawned upon the man, then bound|ing ran before him. The curio&s;ity of Wolkmar was rou&s;ed, he ro&s;e to meet the &s;tranger, who, as he drew near, appeared old, very old, his &s;teps &s;carce &s;upporting with a &s;taff; a blue man|tle was wrapped around him, and his hair and beard, white as &s;now, waving to the breeze of the hill, received from beneath a dark cloud, the la&s;t deep crim&s;on of the &s;etting &s;un.</P>
<P>The dog now ran wagging his tail, fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, and then to the &s;tranger, leaping upon each with marks of the utmo&s;t rapture, till too rudely expre&s;&s;ing his joy, the old man tottering, fell at the foot of a bla&s;ted beech, that &s;tood at the bottom of the hill. Wolkmar ha&s;tened to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> relief, and had ju&s;t reached the &s;pot, when &s;tart|ing back, he exclaimed, "My father, O my fa|ther!" Gothre, for &s;o the old man was called, &s;aw and knew his &s;on, a &s;mile of ec&s;tacy lighted up his features, a hectic flu&s;hed his cheek, his
<PB N="56" REF="028632_0032_0FD9BB42431083F0">
eyes beamed tran&s;port through the waters that &s;uf|fu&s;ed them, and &s;tretching forth his arms, he faintly uttered, "My beloved &s;on!" Nature could no more: The bloom upon his withered cheek fled fa&s;t away, the dewy lu&s;tre of his eye grew dim, and &s;training Wolkmar with convul|&s;ive energy, the la&s;t long breath of aged Gothre fled cold acro&s;s the cheek of his &s;on.</P>
<P>The night grew dark and unlovely, the moon &s;truggled to appear, and by fits her pale light &s;treamed acro&s;s the lake, a &s;ilence deep and ter|rible prevailed, unbroken but by a &s;hriek, that at intervals died along the valley. Wolkmar lay entrance upon the dead body of his father, the dog &s;tood motionle&s;s by his &s;ide; but at la&s;t a|larmed, he licked their faces, and pulled his ma&s;ter by the coat, till having in vain endeavour|ed to awaken them, he ran howling dreadfully along the valley; the demon of the night trem|bled on his hill of &s;torms, and the rocks returned a deepening echo.</P>
<P>Wolkmar at la&s;t awoke, a cold &s;weat trickled over his forehead, every mu&s;cle &s;hook with hor|ror, and, kneeling by the body of Gothre, he wept aloud. "Where is my Fanny," he ex|claimed, "Where &s;hall I find her; oh! that thou had'&s;t told me &s;he yet lived, good old man! if alive, my God, &s;he mu&s;t be near; The night is dark, the&s;e mountains are unknown to me." As
<PB N="57" REF="028632_0032_0FD9BB42431083F0">
he &s;poke, the illumined edge of a cloud &s;hone on the face of Gothre, a &s;mile yet dwelt upon his features; "Smile&s;t thou, my father," &s;aid Wolk|man, "I feel it at my heart; all &s;hall yet be well." Wolkmar, retiring a few paces from his father, threw him&s;elf on the ground.</P>
<P>He had not continued many minutes in this &s;i|tuation, before the di&s;tant &s;ound of voices &s;truck his ear; they &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from different parts of the valley, and two or three evidently ap|proached the &s;pot wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re Gothre lay; the name of Gothre was at length loudly repeated, and Gothre! Gothre! mournfully ran from rock to rock. Wolkmar, &s;tarting from the ground &s;ighed with anxiety and apprehen&s;ion, leaning forward he li&s;tened with fearful apprehen&s;ion, but the beating of his heart appalied him. The dog who, at fir&s;t alarmed had crept to his ma&s;ter's feet, began now to beark with vehemence; &s;ud|denly the voices cea&s;ed, and Wolkmar thought he heard the &s;oft and quick tread of people fa&s;t approaching. At this moment the moon bur&s;t from behind a dark cloud and &s;hone full on the dead body of Gothre. A &s;hrill &s;hriek pierced the air, and a young woman ru&s;hing forward fell on the body of Gothre. "Oh, my Billy," &s;he exclaimed to a little boy, who ran up to her out of breath, "&s;ee your beloved Gothre! he is gone for ever, gone to Heaven and left us: O my poor child! (cla&s;ping the boy, who cried

mo&s;t bitterly) what &s;hall we do without him, what will become of us, we will die al&s;o, my Billy! Gothre is gone to your own dear father, and they are both happy yonder, my Billy," pointing to the moon.</P>
<P>Wolkmar, in the mean time, &s;tood enveloped with &s;hade, his arms &s;tretched out, motionle&s;s, and fixed in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment; his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he faintly and with difficulty uttered, "My Fanny, my child!" His accents reached her ear, &s;he &s;prang wildly from the ground, "It is my Wolkmar's "&s;pirit," &s;he ex|claimed&punc; The &s;ky in&s;tantly cleared all around, and Wolkmar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon her &s;ight. They ru&s;h|ed together, &s;he fainted. "God of mercies!" cried Wolkmar, "if thou wilt not drive me mad, re&s;tore her to life: She breathes, I thank thee, O my God, &s;he breathes! the wife of Wolkmar lives!" Fanny recovering, felt the warm em|brace of her beloved hu&s;band; "Dear, dear Wolkmar," &s;he faintly whi&s;pered, "Thy Fan|ny&mdash;I cannot &s;peak; my Wolkmar, I am too happy; &s;ee our Billy!" The boy had crept clo&s;e to his father, and was cla&s;ping him round the knees. The tide of affection ru&s;hed impe|tuou&s;ly through the bo&s;om of Wolkmar, "it pre&s;&s;es on my heart," he &s;aid, "I cannot bear it. The dome&s;tics, whom Fanny had brought with her, crouded round: "Let us kneel," &s;aid Wolkmar, round the body of aged Gothre:"

<HEAD>THE FORCE OF LOVE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>THE CASTLE OF COSTANZO. AN ITALIAN STORY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the Italian Nobles who embraced the French intere&s;t, and along with it were bani&s;hed from Lombardy, the Count de Con&s;tan|zo was of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. On the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Imperial arms there, his e&s;tate fell to the Duke of Modena, and him&s;elf, with an on|ly child, withdrew into France, where he remain|ed until he introduced Nicolo his &s;on into the French army.</P>
<P>Nicolo, by gallantry and conduct equal to his birth, ran a con&s;iderable length in the career of military advancement, till his progre&s;s was pre|maturely &s;topped, by a wound he received in one of the Flemi&s;h campaigns, which di&s;abled him from the exerci&s;e of his commi&s;&s;ion. Upon this he retires, with a wife and daughter, into an ho|nourable privacy in a village of Auvergne, where he lived upon a provi&s;ion allowed him by the
<PB N="62" REF="028632_0035_0FDA331BE7694F48">
King for &s;ome years, until the death of his wife, combining with other circum&s;tances, induced him at length to remove at the age of 50 to the place of his birth.</P>
<P>On his arrival there under another name, which he a&s;&s;umed to prevent &s;u&s;picion or di&s;tur|bance, he found the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his father oc|cupied by Manfredi, an officer placed over them by the Duke of Modena; and not far from the ca&s;tle of Con&s;tanzo, in a &s;mall and &s;olitary hou&s;e, he and his daughter took up their re&s;idence.</P>
<P>His delight, his employment, his con&s;olation, centered in Leonora. To trace the dawning of her charms, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the growth of her vir|tues, were his only relief from that dejection, which the idea of a lo&s;t wife, and the &s;ight of a forfeited inheritance hourly in&s;pired. Often would he take her through the woods of Co&s;tan|zo&mdash;but the &s;cene was &s;till too powerful for him. At every object he would gaze in pathe|tic &s;ilence, or break into my&s;terious ejaculation&mdash; "But what do we here, Leonora!" would he ex|claim&mdash;"the&s;e are not our grounds&mdash;O cruel u&s;urpers! have ye robbed her too? what had &s;he done? Unborn innocent! was &s;he al&s;o your ene|my?" Alarmed, his lovely companion would inquire the meaning, but the fate of his family was &s;till concealed from her.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="028632_0035_0FDA331BE7694F48">Their mode of living was as reclu&s;e as their &s;ituation. Leonora never went abroad without her father, except to a neighbouring convent, where &s;he learnt of the Nuns &s;ome female accom|pli&s;hments; nor did &s;he ever appear in public, except at church. However, it was her fate to catch the greedy eye of Manfredi. She was then &s;carce fifteen, and though her beauty was not ripened into its full luxuriance, yet then it appeared a mo&s;t alluring blo&s;&s;om.</P>
<P>Manfredi, though en&s;laved to lu&s;t and revenge (for the&s;e were the two mo&s;t forward features of his character) was neverthele&s;s both able and o|bliged to maintain in his conduct the utmo&s;t ri|gour of decorum. 'Twas by &s;uch an appearance, that he at fir&s;t won the e&s;teem of his Prince, and to &s;uch he then owed his &s;ituation at Co&s;|tanzo; for the Duke, generous to romantic ex|ce&s;s, thinking that the welfare of his va&s;&s;als, which was the ruling object of his life, would be promoted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng &s;uch a character as Manfredi over that part of his domain, &s;acrificed an umb|rage he entertained again&s;t him, to &s;uch a noble con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Stung by the fa&s;cinating eyes of Leonora, which, in &s;pite of her purity, could look nothing but love, Manfredi at fir&s;t conceived the ba&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t de&s;igns on her innocence, and made &s;ome clan|de&s;tine efforts to accompli&s;h them; but by the
<PB N="64" REF="028632_0036_0FDA331E27C16610">
fond vigilance of her father, he was always baf|fled, though never detected. At length his ap|petite (for it was not love) grew too unruly for con&s;traint; and one night he went in di&s;gui&s;e to Co&s;tanzo's hou&s;e, where reconnoitering the window of Leonora's apartment, he attempted through it to gain admi&s;&s;ion to her bed. The window was in the upper &s;tory, and looked into a &s;mall inclo&s;ure behind the hou&s;e, which &s;erved for a garden. The wall, on that &s;ide, was cover|ed to the top with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, which on his applying the ladder whereby he was to get up, made &s;uch a &s;udden ru&s;tling as rou&s;ed Leonora from &s;leep. She remained, however, trembling in her bed, till &s;he heard and &s;aw a per&s;on breaking open her ca&s;ement. Alarmed, &s;he &s;prung up, flew to the window, and, by an impul&s;e of de&s;peration, thru&s;t the ruffian and his ladder down together. But the exertion exhau&s;ted he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;he &s;unk on the floor in a &s;woon, during which Manfredi, though mi&s;erably brui&s;ed, made &s;hift to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbance awoke Co&s;tanzo&mdash;Leonora ru&s;hed into his thoughts; he ro&s;e up, went into her apartment, and there, with unutterable ter|ror, found her extended, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, at the &s;oot of her bed. By his tender aid, however, &s;he in a &s;hort time recovered, and &s;atisfied him with re|gard to the occa&s;ion of her fright; but who the per&s;on was, or how &s;he delivered her&s;elf from him remained inexplicable. The affair, at length,
<PB N="65" REF="028632_0036_0FDA331E27C16610">
was co&s;trued into a purpo&s;e of robbery&mdash;things were &s;et in &s;ecurity; &s;he removed into her fa|ther's apartment, and the remainder of the night was &s;pent in repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next day Leonora, as u&s;ual, repaired to the convent, and was engaged among the holy &s;i&s;ters till evening; but then, when &s;he returned home, what was her horror to find the hou&s;e de&s;olate and empty, no father, no furniture there&mdash;the doors torn off their hinges, and the wind whil&s;t|ling dolefully through the di&s;mantled windows! The poor young forlorn, ran di&s;tractedly through every room, calling on her father; and &s;hricking unregarded, till a monk, who was pa&s;&s;ing that way to the convent, heard her, and drew nigh, when learning the circum&s;tances of her di&s;tre&s;s, he endeavoured to appea&s;e her angui&s;h,</P>
<P>He went with her to all the cottages around, but nobody could give them any tidings of Co&s;|tanzo, or account for the &s;trange calamity. The Pea&s;ants declared, &s;ome with looks of &s;u&s;picion, others of &s;urpri&s;e, and all of pity, that they had not &s;een that day any glimp&s;e of &s;uch an affair. Their &s;earch continued till midnight? and Leo|nora would have traver&s;ed every inch of ground in the Duchy, ere &s;he &s;topped un&s;atisfied, had not the benevolent father in&s;i&s;ted on her accom|panying him to the convent.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="028632_0037_0FDA3324F7D18148">When &s;he arrived there, her affliction a&s;&s;umed a new form. Such terror and exertion brought on a fever of the mo&s;t dangerous a&s;pect, during which &s;he raved, day and night, about her father and her mi&s;ery. The efforts of medicine, how|ever, promoted by her youth, overcame the di&s;|ea&s;e; but though her health was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure re&s;tored, the wound of &s;orrow was &s;till fre&s;h in her heart, for nothing as yet had been heard of Co&s;tanzo.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as her enfeebled body could reach the di&s;tance, and her religious protectors would al|low her, &s;he ventured forth to the de&s;olate hou&s;e. There was &s;omething &s;o di&s;mal in the air of that premature ruin, as would damp the mo&s;t indiffer|ent &s;pectator; what then mu&s;t its effect have been on Leonora? Her heart &s;ickened within her, when on entering, &s;he behold the lower apart|ments employed in penning a few &s;heep, and the floors of the upper defiled by the feathers and excrements of crows. But when &s;he entered her father's chamber, the &s;hock became too mighty for her feelings. Recollection furni&s;hed its empty walls with every thing they once con|tained: her eye, in a frenzy of &s;orrow, &s;eemed to devour the melancholy blank: when it came to that corner where Con&s;tanzo's bed u&s;ed to lie, a thou&s;and thoughts crouded into her fancy &mdash;&s;he thought &s;he &s;aw him expiring there&mdash;mur|derers and poignards, and blood aggravated the
<PB N="67" REF="028632_0037_0FDA3324F7D18148">
idea&mdash;&s;he recoiled from the phantom which &s;he formed; and ran down &s;tairs, trembling at the echo of her own foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>At the thre&s;hold &s;he &s;unk down, and there gave vent to an accumilation of tears, till inter|rupted by the approach of a &s;tranger on hor&s;e|back. This was no lower a per&s;onage than the Duke of Modena, who being then on an annual vi&s;it to that part of his dominions, re&s;ided at the ca&s;tle of Co&s;tanzo, where Manfredi &s;till lay con|fined by his brui&s;es. The Duke happened that day to be hunting in the neighbourhood; and ob&s;erving at &s;ome di&s;tance, the beautiful young creature in a po&s;ture of picture&s;que affliction, rode up to her. An heart, &s;o humanely noble as his, mu&s;t be a party at &s;uch a &s;pectacle. He enquired her &s;tory, and &s;he told it with &s;uch melancholy &s;weetne&s;s, as both wet his eyes, and warmed his heart. The circum&s;tance of the noc|turnal a&s;&s;ault drew his keene&s;t attention&mdash;"a thought has &s;truck me" &s;aid he "pray, was the window high?" Alas! &s;o high Sir, "&s;he replied, I tremble at the mi&s;chief the per&s;on may have received&mdash;but, if you plea&s;e, I'll &s;how it you." They went round; and, as they were &s;urveying the window, one of the Duke's hounds, that had overleap'd the hedge of the enclo&s;ure, returned, bearing in his teeth a &s;cabbard enclo&s;ing half the blade of a &s;word. The Duke's &s;u&s;picions were &s;trengthened. He went with Leonora into
<PB N="68" REF="028632_0038_0FDA332A28748970">
the garden, and found, under the window that had been a&s;&s;ailed, the remaining part of the &s;word lying among &s;ome &s;hurbs. Snatching it up, and ob&s;erving a cre&s;t, engraved on the hilt, "ha! I am righ&mdash;it was, it was Manfredi&mdash;This is the ruffian's &s;word broken in the fall&mdash;his brui&s;es confirm it. Courage, thou lovely &s;ufferer! thy father may yet be re&s;tored to thee. The mon&s;ter that could attempt thy ruin, would not &s;hrink from his.

Leo|nora, lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and hope, &s;uffered her|&s;elf to be placed on the Duke's hor&s;e, who at|tended her on foot to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>When they arrived there, he in&s;tantly repair|ed to Manfredi's chamber; and introducing Leo|nora, a&s;ked him whether he knew that lady&mdash; "No, (replied the alarmed criminal)&mdash;nor this &s;word?"&mdash;"What? that &s;word:&mdash;why"&mdash;but guilt &s;hackled his tongue, and unhinged his di&s;|&s;imulation. "Attrocious wretch!" cried the Duke, "is this the honor, that the humanity that won my favor?&mdash;But where is her father? &mdash;Mon&s;ter of revenge!&mdash;that he &s;hould &s;uffer for the hurt his daughter occa&s;ioned, a hurt you more than de&s;erved!&mdash;But where is he.&mdash;On your life produce him &s;afe." Manfredi, having by this time recollected him&s;elf, hardily denied any knowledge or concern in the affair; but, on
<PB N="69" REF="028632_0038_0FDA332A28748970">
the demand of his Prince, was obliged to deli|ver up the keys of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Duke went him&s;elf, with Leonora and two officers, through every apartment, but could not find Co&s;tanzo. Hope &s;hrunk away from their bo&s;oms, and &s;u&s;picion began to follow it. Returning, however, through a pa&s;&s;age under ground, they heard a deep groan proceeding from a contiguous vault which had e&s;caped their &s;earch. The door, though curiou&s;ly concealed, they at la&s;t found out; but as none of the keys that were given them, could unlock it, the Duke impatiently ordered it to be forced open with a crow; and, entering with lights, found the gha&s;t|ly figure of Co&s;tanzo &s;tretched on the floor, he could &s;carce lift up his emaciated form ere it was cla&s;ped in his daughter's arms;&mdash;"my father," &mdash;"ha, my Leonora!&mdash;but the tears and tran&s;|ports of the interview de&s;cription mu&s;t not at|tempt. At la&s;t, &s;ays Co&s;tanzo, art thou come, my child to &s;ee me dying in a dungeon of my fa|ther's ca&s;tle,&mdash;"what, interrupted the Duke, art thou Co&s;tanzo, thou the &s;on of that unfortunate nobleman who&s;e e&s;tate my father &s;eized?&mdash;Yes, yes, the &s;ame, the companion of my youthful &s;tudies at Ferrara&mdash;every feature of Nicoli &s;till langui&s;hes in that vi&s;age, in &s;pite of years and di&s;tre&s;s I can trace them; let me &s;hare with thee, Leonora, in that embrace. They immediately left that place of horror, and repaired to Man|fredi.
<PB N="70" REF="028632_0039_0FDA3330E902EE90">
The Duke could not &s;peak the tumult of his benevolent joy; what angel, cried he, has put &s;o much of Heaven in my power, as to re|&s;tore a parent from the jaws of murder to the embrace of his child, to re&s;tore an Earldom, from the cu&s;tody of a villain, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its heir.

<HEAD>SOLYMAN AND ALMENA. AN EASTERN STORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN a plea&s;ant valley of Me&s;opotamia, on the banks of the Irwin, lived Solyman, &s;on of Ardavan, the &s;age. He was early in&s;tructed in all the oriential languages; but, as his under|&s;tanding opened, like the flower in the morning, when Aurora dawns in the ea&s;t, he thir&s;ted only for the knowledge of mankind. He prevailed on his father, with much importunity, to per|mit him to travel. The morning was &s;pread up|on the mountains, and Solyman prepared to de|part; but fir&s;t pro&s;trating him&s;elf towards the &s;un, he addre&s;&s;ed that glorious luminary in devo|tion, and then pa&s;&s;ed over the Tigris, into the kingdom of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome &s;ecret attraction in the place, where we have pa&s;&s;ed the chearful innocence of childhood. No &s;ooner had Solyman a&s;cended an eminence which gave him a retro&s;pective view of the valley of Irwin, than he turned his eyes on
<PB N="72" REF="028632_0040_0FDA33356D4A3918">
his native fields, and gazed on them with a kind of pen&s;ive complacency, till the declining day called him to proceed.</P>
<P>When he had reached the foot of Mount Tau|rus, he &s;ought to repo&s;e him&s;elf in the valley of Abdat; but he was &s;topped by an exclamation of &s;orrow which proceeded from an ajacent wood. As he was in hopes of relieving &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, he drew near, and di&s;covering two lovers, who had &s;tolen a &s;ecret interview before their final &s;e|paration. Being made acquainted with the cau&s;e of their &s;orrow, and finding it proceeded from the avariciou&s;ne&s;s of the lady's father, who had &s;old his daughter to a Khan of Buckharia, he of|fered them his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which being accepted, he conducted them back to the banks of the Ti|gris; and, recommending them to his father, continued his travels, till he arrived at I&s;pahan.</P>
<P>The beauty and magnificence of that city en|gaged his attention for many days; but his great|e&s;t plea&s;ure derived from the conver&s;ation of an Engli&s;h merchant, from whom he learnt many things relating to the manners and pur&s;uits of men in different countries, particularly in Great Britain. With this merchant, he afterwards &s;et out for the court of Ba&s;&s;ora; but, being driven by the heat of the &s;un to &s;eek for &s;helter on the declivity of a neighbouring mountain, they were led by accident to the cave of a hermit. The
<PB N="73" REF="028632_0040_0FDA33356D4A3918">
good old father at fir&s;t retreated from them, fear|ful of the effects of human ferocity; but being &s;oon convinced they were only inoffen&s;ive travel|lers, he afterwards acquainted them with the hi&s;tory of his life.</P>
<P>The hermit told them that he was born of competent fortune; but, being left an orphan, was deprived of it, partly by the chicanery of a court of equity, and of the re&s;t through the treachery of a friend. This obliged him to en|ter as a common &s;oldier in the army of the Sophy, where he fell in love with the daughter of the commanding officer, which plunged him again into new misfortunes, and at la&s;t ended in his betaking him&s;elf to tho&s;e &s;olitary mountains for a retreat.</P>
<P>After having fini&s;hed his tale, the travellers took their leave, and, about the clo&s;e of the day, arrived at the village of Arden. At their entrance, they were met by a per&s;on in a plain dre&s;s, who invited them to partake of his hou&s;e and table that night. The ho&s;pitality they re|ceived from him, gave Solyman very different ideas of the di&s;po&s;itions of mankind, from what his own partial ob&s;ervation, aided by the ad|ventures of the two lovers, and the tale of the hermit, had enabled him to form. When the dawn of the morning broke, Solyman and the
<PB N="74" REF="028632_0041_0FDA3336E90870B8">
merchant left the village of Arden, and after a few days travel, arrived on the plain, on which &s;tood the once glorious Per&s;epolis. The con|templation of its ruins filled their minds with proper reflections on the in&s;tability of human grandieur, and from thence they proceeded to the court of Ba&s;&s;ora.</P>
<P>The merchant here finding the ve&s;&s;el he ex|pected, told Solyman he could accommodate him, if he plea&s;ed, with a pa&s;&s;age to Europe, which the de&s;ire the latter had of &s;eeing foreign countries induced him to accept: but as the &s;hip was to remain &s;ome time in the gulph, he took that opportunity to make the tour of India, and, in his way vi&s;ited the i&s;le of Ormus. There he met with an exile from I&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an, who had been doomed to &s;pend his life in that dreary &s;pot, for no other crime, than that he had &s;aid at court, he thought the Sultana Moratte extremely beau|tiful. The unmerited &s;everity of his &s;entence moved the tender heart of Solyman. He pro|mi&s;ed him his liberty, at his return from the excur&s;ion he was making, and continued his route for India.</P>
<P>Being come to Delhi, the capital of the Mo|gul's empire, his heart, which had hitherto been a &s;tranger to love, fell a victim to the charms of the accompli&s;hed Almena. He thought no more of performing his voyage to Europe; but the
<PB N="75" REF="028632_0041_0FDA3336E90870B8">

Having &s;ettled every thing rela|tive to the departure of the exile, he took the opportunity of the &s;hip's delay in &s;etting out, to vi|&s;it his father, from whom he learned the &s;equel of the adventures of the two lovers who had been recommended by him to his care. Almena, how|ever, &s;till continuing uppermo&s;t in his mind, and the time for the departure of the ve&s;&s;el drawing near, he again left Arden, and, having &s;een the exile &s;afely embarked at Ba&s;&s;ora, proceeded to Delhi.</P>
<P>Solyman and Almena, being now a &s;econd time together, mutual profe&s;&s;ions of love and friend&s;hip en&s;ued, in con&s;equence of which they agreed to quit Delhi, and to retire for the re|mainder of their days to the valley of Irwan. But a war at that time raging in India, and the lovers unhappily taking their pa&s;&s;age in a ve&s;&s;el belonging to one of the contending parties, they had &s;carcely got five leagues out to &s;ea, before they were pur&s;ued by the foe, and after an ob|&s;tinate engagement, made pri&s;oners. The enemy &s;tripped the ve&s;&s;el of every thing va|luable, then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it; but they carried off Almena.</P>
<P>What pen can de&s;cribe the grief of Solyman! his fair one carried he knew not whither, and

He found means to break from this confinement ju&s;t in time to re&s;cue Al|mena from the brutality of the tyrant, whom he killed; but the guards coming upon him in that in&s;tant, they were both made pri&s;oners, and &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle, till it was taken by a party of the King of the Kanarians.</P>
<P>This incident, from which the two lovers might have hoped for deliverance, only added to their woes. They were again &s;eparated, and Almena &s;elected for the plea&s;ures of the King of Kanaria. Solyman, however, having found means to introduce him&s;elf into the King's &s;er|vice, repaired to the palace, and acquainted him with the whole &s;tory of their pa&s;&s;ion. A violent &s;truggle at fir&s;t aro&s;e in the King's brea&s;t between
<PB N="77" REF="028632_0042_0FDA3339E3CD4498">
love and virtue; but the latter triumphed, and Almena was re&s;tored to Solyman.</P>
<P>The two lovers being thus, once more, mi|raculou&s;ly brought together, and unwilling to ri&s;que their happine&s;s again upon the &s;eas, de|determined to travel by land for the valley of Irwan. After many days tedious journey, they arrived at Delhi, from whence they continued their route to I&s;pahan, where Solyman found his old friend the merchant. The cu&s;tomary congratulations over, and the merchant being informed of the particu|lars of their adventures, Solyman then gave him an invitation to accompany him to the valley of Irwan, which was accordingly accepted. In their way, they vi&s;ited the two lovers mention|ed in the preceding part of the &s;tory, whom they found completely happy. Having been witne&s;&s;es of their felicity, they proceeded to the valley of Irwan, where Ardavan received them with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s; and Solyman and Almena, happy in them&s;elves, and in each o|ther, clo&s;ed the returning day with prayer and prai&s;e to that Providence, which had pre|&s;erved them in all their dangers.</P>

<HEAD>MAHMUT AND IDRIS. AN ORIENTAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the dancers of the palace, in the reign of Abbas the Great, King of Per&s;ia, there was a young maid, named Idris, whom the ma&s;ter of the revels, on the report of her charms, had &s;ent for from Ca&s;bin to I&s;pahan. Her mother being of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he had followed the &s;ame way of life; but as &s;he honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf from her female-companions, &s;he demon&s;trated that virtue is prac|ticable in every &s;ituation of life, however &s;lip|pery or dangerous it may be.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Idris appeared in the theatre of the capital, but &s;he found her&s;elf be&s;et by the grandees, who &s;trove to plea&s;e her by the &s;ame means that had won others in that &s;tation. One exhau&s;ted all his rhetoric, in commending her &s;hape and manner; another extolled the form of her face; her complexion, and the regularity of her features.&mdash;. third, to give weight to the
<PB N="79" REF="028632_0043_0FDA333EE4D0AEC0">
encomiums he had be&s;towed upon her voice; re|peated an air he had heard her &s;ing, and decla|red his di&s;traction to arive at that grace with which &s;he gave life to her words.&mdash;A fourth, boa&s;ting his preci&s;ion and &s;kill in dancing, ex|hibited in&s;tantly &s;ome of the attitudes he had learned of her. A fir&s;t-rate Sir Fopling, gave her a li&s;t of the pretty women he had de&s;erted, from the moment he fir&s;t &s;aw her. A young Iman, by birth intitled to become a Mollah, &s;i|lently di&s;played his figure and his dre&s;s. And old fingerer of the public money, dazzled her eyes with a diamond of the fir&s;t water, and offered it, be&s;ides the perqui&s;ites of the contracts, which it was his cu&s;tom to be&s;tow upon his mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;An officer of the crown made pompous de&s;criptions of the pre&s;ents with which he had recompen&s;ed the friend&s;hip of the little Zazi. In fine, every one exerted his faculties, and his addre&s;s, in or|der to gain the preference over his rivals.</P>
<P>But Idris was not to be caught by &s;uch baits. At the palace, at a&s;&s;emblies, in the public walks; and in all places, the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the new dancer, every one talked of her beauty, her wit, her engaging behaviour; and, which was more than they had &s;aid of any other of her profe&s;&s;ion; they agreed in acknowledging her to be very virtuous. It is the property of none but the mo&s;t exalted virtue to gain the re&s;|pect and admiration of young courtiers. Mah|mut
<PB N="80" REF="028632_0044_0FDA3340A1728FA0">
concieved a high opinion of Idris's virtue, from the extraordinary effect it produced.</P>
<P>Mahmut bore among the lords of the court, the &s;ame character which Idris maintained among the dancers of her &s;ex; proof again&s;t the defects of his equals, and the vices of his &s;tation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he began to appear in the world, he became &s;en&s;ible of the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of that noi|&s;y ob&s;treperous giddine&s;s, which mo&s;t young peo|ple of quality affect; and being happily prejudi|ced again&s;t the idle life he &s;aw them lead, he took care not to follow their example, yet with|out &s;eeming to condemn them. While their days were divided between the toilet, the table, vi&s;its, and gaming, he &s;pent the morning in the clo&s;et among his books; or, with tho&s;e who&s;e conver|&s;ation could in&s;truct him better.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he frequented the manufacto|ries, and working places about the palace; talk|ed with the able&s;t hands in the &s;everal arts; and ob&s;erved, with the utmo&s;t attention, how they proceeded in their works.</P>
<P>In the evening was at &s;ome or other of the public entertainments, which he enjoyed with a moderation that is ever in&s;eparable from ta&s;te and di&s;cernment. After which he repaired to &s;ome of the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;emblies of I&s;pahan,
<PB N="81" REF="028632_0044_0FDA3340A1728FA0">
as well to avoid a &s;ingularity that would have rendered him odious as to acquire a greater &s;hare of the complai&s;ance and politene&s;s which reigned in them.</P>
<P>Mahmut's wit, and the u&s;e he made of it, rendered him &s;uperior to tho&s;e who were his e|quals in birth; and, be&s;ides the advantage of a good figure and graceful air, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf no le&s;s among them by his natural and acquired talents. Idris could not behold this amiable Per&s;ian without emotion&mdash;&s;he &s;hunned all her importunate &s;uitors, and complacently fancying him free from all their faults, &s;he &s;e|cretly wi&s;hed that the beauty which they &s;o highly extolled, might make an impre&s;&s;ion on him. Her wi&s;hes were met more than half way. Mahmut &s;oon let her know that he loved her mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately; and her an&s;wer to his declara|tion, on account of its &s;ingularity, de&s;erves to be given entire.</P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s you give the name of love, (&s;aid &s;he, with a charming &s;mile) to that which is on|ly an effect of your ta&s;te for novelty: I will not, my lord, go farther, at pre&s;ent, on this head; it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to fix my judgment. I will ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;s, though it will give you &s;ome unfavorable opinion of me, if you are not the man I take you to be, that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed at your liking me: but if ever I &s;ee occa&s;ion to al|ter
<PB N="82" REF="028632_0045_0FDA3342264FF3F0">
the idea I have conceived of you, hope not that I &s;hall, in the lea&s;t, indulge my inclination. I &s;hall not take it ill if you give your heart to a woman more virtuous hand, therefore, do not complain of your lot, if I di&s;po&s;e of mine, in fa|vor of any man whom I may find &s;uperior to you in virtue."</P>
<P>Mahmut, &s;truck with admiration, and over|flowing with joy, laboured to ri&s;e to &s;uch a pitch as might oblige Idris to be con&s;tant to him. He applied him&s;elf, with fre&s;h vigor, to ac|quire the arts and &s;ciences nece&s;&s;ary for a man in his &s;tation. He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to relieve indigent merit and unfortunate virtue. His hu|manity, genero&s;ity, capacity, and mode&s;ty, were equally con&s;picuous; and Idris abundantly re|warded him for all the pains he took to plea&s;e her. Prai&s;e grounded on truth, and coming from the mouth of &s;o charming a per&s;on, filled the tender Mahmut's heart with joy and &s;atisfac|tion. He read, in the eyes of his beauteous mi&s;tre&s;s, how dear he was to her. He talked of his pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;cribed its violence. Idris li&s;tened to him with plea&s;ure, vowed &s;he would make him a ju&s;t return; and thus animated him to give her no occa&s;ion to repent her engage|ment. In the&s;e overflowings of their hearts, which none but true lovers can know, and feel the &s;weetne&s;s of, they laid open to each other the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of their &s;ouls. Mahmut was grieved when he took leave of Idris, nor could
<PB N="83" REF="028632_0045_0FDA3342264FF3F0">
&s;he bear his ab&s;ence without a vi&s;ible concern.&mdash; They always parted under the greate&s;t impatience to meet again.</P>
<P>Between two neighbors, &s;o powerful, as the Grand Signor and the King of Per&s;ia, there can be no long peace, a war &s;oon broke out, and Mahmut was obliged to &s;et out for the army. He waited upon Idris to deplore with her the dire nece&s;&s;ity that forced them a&s;&s;under; but whil&s;t he lay at her feet, he dur&s;t not di&s;clo&s;e to her all his grief. The fortitude of the fair-one daunted him. He was afraid of le&s;&s;ening him&s;elf in her e&s;teem, by di&s;covering any weakne&s;s.&mdash; Idris perceived the &s;ore conflict in his brea&s;t, and loved him for it more inten&s;ely.</P>
<P>Mahmut had not been gone a month when he gave way to his de&s;ire of an interview with Idris. He &s;lipped away privately from the army, and with the help of relays, which he had got ready on the road, he was at the gates of I&s;pahan be|fore they mi&s;&s;ed him in the camp. Alighting at the hou&s;e of one of his old &s;ervants, he di&s;gui|&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a pea&s;ant, that he might not be known in the city; and, impatient for an interview with his Idris, he &s;lew to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The charming maid was &s;itting at a balcony, as Mahmut was advancing, and knew him, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="84" REF="028632_0046_0FDA33B7E57660B8">
his di&s;gui&s;e. Grieved to &s;ee him thus neglect his glory, and his duty, &s;he ran di|rectly to her clo&s;et, charging her &s;lave to admit no vi&s;itor whatever. She melted into tears at the weakne&s;s of her lover; but &s;oon recovered her|&s;elf, and wrote him the following billet:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>IDRIS TO THE PEASANT.</HEAD>
<P>Friend, I know thou art to be forthwith at the army. Call upon Mahmut, and tell him from me, that I de&s;ire him to remember the conditions on which the heart of Idris is to be &s;ecured.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mahmut was too much confounded with the&s;e words to a&s;k any que&s;tions of the &s;lave that deli|vered him the billet. He went back to his do|me&s;tic's hou&s;e, to put off his di&s;gui&s;e; and fluc|tuating between admiration, grief, and fear, he repaired again to the army with as much ha&s;te as he had travelled up to I&s;pahan, his chief &s;tudy being to make amends for the fault he had com|mitted: he behaved the re&s;t of the campaign with &s;o much ardor, bravery, and conduct, that he was de&s;ervedly promoted to a higher po&s;t, which the King conferred on him with the mo&s;t honorable eulogies at the head of the army. Idris wrote him a congratulatory letter on his promotion, in which, without mentioning his weakne&s;s, &s;he gave him to under&s;tand that &s;he had forgiven him.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028632_0046_0FDA33B7E57660B8">Mahmut, tran&s;ported with joy, ha&s;tened back to I&s;pahan, as &s;oon as the army was ordered in|to winter-quarters, and li&s;tened to no other con|&s;iderations but his e&s;teem for this virtuous girl. He intreated her to complete his happine&s;s in becoming his wife. "Your wife, my lord, (cried Idris, with an emotion that once di&s;cover|ed the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion and concern for the glo|ry of her lover;) what! would Mahmut forget him&s;elf &s;o far? In di&s;po&s;ing of your heart you may, indeed, con&s;ult nothing but your inclina|tions; but when the que&s;tion is to chu&s;e a part|ner in your dignity and fortune, you are ac|countable to tho&s;e of whom you hold both. I have the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude for this &s;ignal te&s;timony of your e&s;teem; but what will your relations &s;ay? What will all Per&s;ia &s;ay, who&s;e eyes are upon you, and who &s;ee nothing in me but the mean profe&s;&s;ion I was bred to?&mdash;No; Mahmut, it mu&s;t not be!&mdash;I &s;ee my error; I am a&s;hamed of my weakne&s;s.&mdash;I that am ready to &s;acrifice my life, were it nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve your glory, cannot be in&s;trumental my&s;elf in &s;ul|lying it."</P>
<P>Sentiments like the&s;e made the pa&s;&s;ionate Mah|mut only more pre&s;&s;ing.&mdash;"What are tho&s;e things, (&s;aid he) which create &s;o great a di&s;pa|rity between us? An in&s;tant may deprive us of them; but the dowry which you will bring me,
<PB N="86" REF="028632_0047_0FDA3349EBA48BE0">
charming Idris, is a ble&s;&s;ing that depends not on men, nor fortune." In uttering the&s;e words, his countenance began to be clouded with grief: fre&s;h denials drove him to di&s;pair.&mdash;He drew his poignard, and was going to plunge it into his brea&s;t. The tender Idris could hold out no longer. "Ah! Mahmut, (cried &s;he) &s;top your hand and live.&mdash;To-morrow I &s;hall be yours.&mdash; Grant me this &s;hort re&s;pite!" She could utter no more.&mdash;Tears put an end to her &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;topped her breath!</P>
<P>The news of their marriage &s;oon took wind; and tho&s;e who envied him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o much beauty, abu&s;ed him for his meanne&s;s, while the &s;ober and thinking part of the world extolled their virtues; and only lamented that her birth and fortune had not rendered them more con&s;picuous and attracting. She was pre|&s;ented to the king, who was charmed with her per&s;on! and finding her heart, and her &s;enti|ments would not di&s;grace the highe&s;t quality, added that which reconciled all parties&mdash;a title and place at court.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHEVALIER BAYARD, AND MADAME DE RANDAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Tale of the Fifteenth Century.</HEAD>
<P>MADAME de Randan, of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Miranda, became a widow at twenty years of age, and was incon&s;olable. What grief was ever like her's, and who&s;e eyes, &s;o young and &s;o charming, ever &s;hed &s;o many tears for a dead hu&s;band! The whole talk at court was of the mourning of the young widow. She no lon|ger con&s;ulted her mirror; &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed the deco|rations of dre&s;s, and vowed to the &s;hade of her hu&s;band that &s;he would never more u&s;e them: &s;he muffled her&s;elf up in a hood like a nun; and yet, in that di&s;advantageous attire, Madame de Ran|dan was the lovelie&s;t of all the women of her time.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Bayard, at the age of thirty, had already attained the appellation, of Bayard,
<PB N="88" REF="028632_0048_0FDA334B2287DBE8">
the dauntle&s;s and irreproachable. Palice was proud of having been named with univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e to the command of the army at Ravenna. The&s;e two <HI>preux chevaliers,</HI> who acted a con&s;pi|cuous part in the field, were hardly known at court, and they re&s;igned to the gentle Bonnivet and many others, the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of court favour, content them&s;elves with military fame. Bonnivet, however, &s;ometimes courted the con|ver&s;ation of Palice and Bayard; his frigid &s;oul came to warm it&s;elf at the fire which animated them when they talked of honour, and royalty, and deeds of arms. Bonnivet repayed them with tales of gallantry, with the news and anecdotes of the court. The fair widow had her turn. "What think you," &s;aid he one day to the knights, "of Madame de Randan?" "By this hand, &s;aid Bayard, I never &s;aw &s;o fair a dame." "Be&s;hrew me, added Palice, but it is too much to weep &s;o long for the dead." "Don't you know, replied Bonnivet, that I have undertaken to put a &s;peedy termination to her widow hood? yes, indeed, the fair widow, let me tell you in confidence, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed when I attempt to dry her tears." "Thou art a vain creature, &s;aid Palice," "He is a braggart," rejoined Bay|ard. "Very well gentlemen, &s;aid Bonnivet, ob&s;erve the end," and he took his leave.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange man, &s;aid Palice, is this Ad|miral Bonnivet! When I con&s;ider, replied Bay|ard,
<PB N="89" REF="028632_0048_0FDA334B2287DBE8">
his behaviour to a lady of high rank, into who&s;e chamber he introduced him&s;elf by a &s;trata|gem I am convinced he is enterpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;hort reflections, the two knights &s;at for &s;ome time &s;ilent; &s;trange thoughts were pa&s;&s;ing in their minds, for they were both in love. It was the fir&s;t in&s;tant of their pa&s;&s;ion, and that in&s;tant is certainly &s;ometimes very embarra&s;&s;ing. "It would be a meritorious act, &s;aid Palice, to touch the heart of &s;o fair and accompli&s;hed a lady." "Certainly, &s;aid Bayard, and highly honourable:" and they relap&s;ed again into &s;ilence. They looked at each other, and perceived that they were rivals. "Let there, however, be no difference between us, &s;aid Palice. Let us &s;wear by St. Dennis, that who&s;oever &s;hall be the un&s;uc|ce&s;sful lover, &s;hall immediately yield without complaint; and that if a third &s;hall enter the li&s;ts, the di&s;cared candidate &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t the other, and be his companion in arms. Let us promi&s;e, on the faith of true knights, to relate our &s;ucce&s;s with|out re&s;erve." "I &s;wear," &s;aid Bayard. They embraced and &s;eparated.</P>
<P>The one took the road on the right hand, the other that on the left, but both directed their &s;teps to the hotel of the fair widow. Bayard had already &s;et his foot within the thre&s;hold of her gate, when he &s;aw Palice coming. He had all
<PB N="90" REF="028632_0049_0FDA334E9F51DA50">
his life been above &s;u&s;picion or reproach. "En|ter, my friend, &s;aid he to Palice, you are my &s;e|nior; good night and &s;ucce&s;s to you; I will re|turn to-morrow." At the&s;e words he retired, and Palice was to be announced to the widow.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I de&s;cribe Madame de Randan.&mdash; She wore a grey robe; her hair was unpowdered, and concealed beneath an immen&s;e hood which covered her face. A &s;mall machine for weaving &s;ilk lace &s;tood before her, and a young girl, who was reading certain &s;elect pages from the &s;tory of Godfrey of Boulogne, was often interupted by the widow with many a &s;igh. This was the Helen for whom the&s;e two brave chevaliers were about to contend. She acknowledged the honor of the Captian's vi&s;it, but it made her neither more talkative nor more at ea&s;e. "You &s;ee be|fore you," &s;aid Palice, "a true knight, who has ju&s;t devoted him&s;elf wholly to your &s;ervice." "How &s;ay you?" &s;aid &s;he, with &s;urpri&s;e. "It is true, fair lady: My hand, my heart, I lay at your feet." At this the widow wept and was &s;i|lent. Palice was affected, and had almo&s;t &s;hed tears. The girl, by a &s;ign, brought forth the picture of M. de Randan, and the widow, as her only an&s;wer, pointed with her finger to this in&s;cription, I LOVE HIM STILL. Palice inter|preted this dumb refu&s;al, and took his leave for that time by declaring that he would never cea&s;e imploring God to di&s;po&s;e her heart to forget the dead, and to have pity on the living.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="028632_0049_0FDA334E9F51DA50">Bayard waited his return with a degree of im|patience. "Alas!" &s;aid Palice, "&s;he was all in tears, &s;he &s;hewed me the portrait of her hu&s;|band, and I have been obliged to retire without hope!" Bayard knew the worth of Palice, and did not flatter him&s;elf. "I will however go to-morrow, &s;aid he, and you &s;hall know the event."</P>
<P>The interview between our chevalier and the widow was not altogether the &s;ame. Bayard was younger than Palice, and his fame was grea|ter. The beauteous widow wept; &s;he &s;hewed the portrait, but &s;he li&s;tened to Bayard; and when he &s;aid to her, "Madam, I will return," &s;he replied, in a low voice; "You will do me a great kindne&s;s.'</P>
<P>The chevalier related to Palice the conver&s;a|tion faithfully. "You will be the happy man," &s;aid the Captain;" &s;he did not &s;peak half &s;o much to me." Palice made another attempt.&mdash; The widow was &s;till in tears; the picture was a|gain pre&s;ented. Bayard returned; and while Palice was always treated in the &s;ame way, the Chevalier was making advances daily. The fair widow began to turn her eyes now and then to her mirror. There was however no change of dre&s;s, no kind looks; but &s;he wept no more, and always prolonged the conver&s;ation by que&s;|tions that demanded long an&s;wers, which the Chevalier never gave with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion.&mdash;
<PB N="92" REF="028632_0050_0FDA3353CAB51AA8">
"Tell me," &s;aid &s;he, one day, "the &s;tory of your being made pri&s;oner in Milan, by Ludovic." I was, &s;aid Bayard, at the head of a party of French; we were met by a party of Italians who attacked us vigorou&s;ly; both &s;ides were &s;o animated that the one did not know they were retreating, nor the other that they were advanc|ing, till we were at the gates of Milan, where the cry of turn, turn, was repeatedly and eagerly uttered. I, who was intent upon victory, was deaf to the cry, and thoughtle&s;&s;ly pur&s;ued into the heart of the city. Immediately &s;oldiers and citizens, and the very women attacked me; but a brave fellow, who had always defended him&s;elf from my &s;trokes, &s;urrounded me with his party, and took me pri&s;oner. Ludovic had &s;een my behaviour from his window and &s;ent for me. "What brought you hither, Chevalier?" &s;aid he, "The de&s;ire of victory," I an&s;wered. "And did you expect to take Milan alone?"&mdash; No, my Lord, but I thought I had been fol|lowed by my comrades." "Though you had, you could not have &s;ucceeded."&mdash;"They were wi&s;er than I; they are free, and I am a pri&s;on|er."&mdash;"What is the &s;trength of the French ar|my"&mdash;"We never reckon by numbers; but I can a&s;&s;ure you the &s;oldiers are all cho&s;en men, before whom your's will never &s;tand."&mdash;"That time will determine; a battle will prove their valour."&mdash;"Would to God it were to-morrow, and that I were free."&mdash;"You are free; I like
<PB N="93" REF="028632_0050_0FDA3353CAB51AA8">
your freedom, and your courage; if you have any thing further to a&s;k of me, it &s;hall be grant|ed."&mdash;I fell at his feet and be&s;ought him to par|don the rudene&s;s of my replies. I begged my hor&s;e and my arms and took leave. Thus ended my adventure at Milan. It was ea&s;y for Ludovic to give me back my liberty; but that which I have lo&s;t with you it is impo&s;&s;ible to re|cover.</P>
<P>Palice was informed of this long conver&s;ation; for Bayard, faithful to his oath, concealed no|thing from him. The next vi&s;it he paid the wi|dow he thought to make his court by detailing the circum&s;tances of the battles he had fought from Marignan to Ravenna; but his labour was lo&s;t; what intere&s;ted the fair widow when told by Bayard, was in&s;iped when related by Palice. This at la&s;t he perceived. "The honor of this conque&s;t," &s;aid he, "is your's, Chevalier; I yield and retire. If a third rival appears, behold me your companion in arms."</P>
<P>The fair widow grew in&s;en&s;ibly enamoured of Bayard; and his conver&s;ation, which at fir&s;t was only a plea&s;ure, became at la&s;t a nece&s;&s;ity. She had quitted her grey attire, and had gradually re&s;umed her former dre&s;s. One would have &s;aid that the certainty of being beloved in&s;pired her with the wi&s;h to plea&s;e. She took a fancy to re|appear at court, with a view of ob&s;erving whe|ther
<PB N="94" REF="028632_0051_0FDA3358AB006C40">
&s;he did not &s;till retain the pre-eminence over all the beauties there. Bayard was the only man who forgave the widow her return to the world, and &s;he was accordingly always called at court the lady of the Chevalier.</P>
<P>Spain having at that time renewed a truce with France, the amba&s;&s;adors of that power were re|ceived at Paris with the greate&s;t pomp. The en|tertainments given by Francis corre&s;ponded with the idea which the Spaniards entertained of his magnificence. The widow was one of tho&s;e who were cho&s;en to figure in the ballets, and &s;he was always the mo&s;t applauded. One of the noble Spaniards who attended the emba&s;&s;y, became e|namoured of her. But all his &s;erenades, and o|ther efforts of gallantry, were fruitle&s;s; and Don Alonzo &s;oon learnt, that the heart, which ap|peared to him imprognable, had a weak &s;ide which lay open to Bayard. The high reputation of his rival did not intimidate him. The more of difficulty and of danger that appeared, but &s;timulated him the more to the attempt.</P>
<P>Don Alonzo according challenged Bayard to &s;ingle combat, which the latter did not refu&s;e. Judges were appointed, and Palice had the guard of the li&s;ts. The news of the duel was &s;oon &s;pread, and the Spaniards, con&s;idering Don A|lonzo was the champion of their country, were anxious for his fate; while the French made
<PB N="95" REF="028632_0051_0FDA3358AB006C40">
vows for the triumph of Bayard; and thus a pri|vate quarrel became almo&s;t a national concern.</P>
<P>But who can de&s;cribe the grief of the widow? She was the innocent cau&s;e of the combat, and accu&s;ed her&s;elf for having appeared beautiful in the eyes of Don Alonzo. How intere&s;ting a moment was this for the &s;oul of our Chevalier, who heard the &s;oft confe&s;&s;ion which he had ne|ver dared to a&s;k for, now uttered amid&s;t a pro|fu&s;ion of tears, of &s;ighs and &s;obbings! He wip|ed away her tears, and &s;poke comfort to her. As a pledge of love &s;he tied round his arm a rib|band and gave him a picture. It was a Cupid re|moving a widow's veil and wiping off her tears with leaves of ro&s;es. The Chevilier received this picture on his knees, and after having ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and times, and a thou&s;and times ki&s;&s;ed the fair hand that gave it, he placed it in his bo&s;om, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Palice led his friend to the li&s;ts, mounted on a &s;tately cour&s;er; but the Spaniard chu&s;ing to fight on foot, the Chevalier di&s;mounted; the judges di&s;tributed the arms to each, and both before engaging recommended them&s;elves to God.&mdash; Then ri&s;ing and making the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, they proceeded to combat.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain the reader with a particular account of the prowe&s;s and addre&s;s of the re|&s;pective
<PB N="96" REF="028632_0052_0FDA335BEEDAA100">
combatants, nor with a de&s;cription of the hopes and fears that agitated their friends.&mdash; Let it be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that, after an ob&s;ti|nate and bloody encounter, the Chevalier Bay|ard &s;lew his opponent and came off victorious. He immediately threw him&s;elf upon his knees, and returned thanks to God, three times ki&s;&s;ing the ground. He was led away in triumph with the &s;ound of trumpets to the church, again to give thanks for his victory, and thence he pro|ceeded to the fair widow.</P>
<P>No one can paint the joy of this lady, but one who could paint her charming eyes, and her whole per&s;on. All was &s;oul, and all, even her very &s;ighs, was joy. From this moment love united their hearts with his &s;tronge&s;t bonds.</P>
<P>Madame de Randan, &s;urrounded with a crowd of importunate lovers, now began to dread the effects of her beauty. The life of Bayard was become &s;o dear to her that &s;he could not think of expo&s;ing it again to another hazard.</P>
<P>She therefore re&s;olved to retire to a &s;eque&s;ter|ed man&s;ion that belonged to her in the country. She did not however inform Bayard of her re&s;o|lution, but &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, HE WILL PER|HAPS COME; and &s;he furni&s;hed a magnificent a|partment for him in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="028632_0052_0FDA335BEEDAA100">The ladies of our age, &s;o decent and &s;o deli|cate, will perhaps be a&s;toni&s;hed that the widow &s;hould provide an apartment in her hou&s;e for one not a hu&s;band: but this was the cu&s;tom, in days of old, <HI>preux Chevaliers</HI> were di&s;creet and re&s;pectful lovers, and never failed to &s;ay, <HI>honni &s;oit qui mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y pence.</HI></P>
<P>Our widow was occupied with Bayard alone: the ladies of the&s;e times are di&s;tracted with &s;o many lovers that they can afford to one but a &s;mall portion of &s;en&s;ibility; and this di&s;traction no doubt is the &s;afeguard of their honour. But alas! when one thinks of none but one, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary does that one become! e&s;pecially when that one is a Bayard!</P>
<P>The lady departed for her retirement in the country, and the Chevalier, it is needle&s;s to &s;ay, did not remain behind. They arrived in great &s;tate at Ferte, where magnificent preparations had been made for their reception; the old &s;ol|diers welcomed the gallant Chevalier with hone&s;t hearts and military honours, while the young girls, of all the neighbouring villages, in their be&s;t array, came out to meet the widow, and pre|&s;ented her with flowers.</P>
<P>How happy were our two lovers! How &s;hort did the days appear to them, tho&s;e days which
<PB N="98" REF="028632_0053_0FDA336115E5AEB0">
others think &s;o tedious in the country! Reading, and rural amu&s;ements were their mo&s;t &s;erious bu|&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, the widow con&s;ented to be a wi|dow no longer. She had &s;worn never to relin|qui&s;h the name of Mon&s;. de Randan.&mdash;She could not break her oath. Her marriage therefore with Bayard was performed in private, and long remained a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>To judge of the happine&s;s of this fond pair, is it nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;een them. Madame de Ran|dan had brought the Chevalier a daughter, de&s;|tined to inherit her mother's beauty, and her fa|ther's honour. To &s;ee Bayard, like another Hector, take of his helmet not to frighten with its black and &s;preading plumes, the little infant which his wife, in an ec&s;tacy of conjugal love and maternal affection, held out to him; to &s;ee Bayard, the flower of chivalry, and the dread of the foes of France, lying on the green &s;od, with a little child on his knees, playing with the hilt of his &s;word; one mu&s;t be a father one's &s;elf to conceive it.</P>
<P>One day as he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in this way, his friend Palice came to &s;ummon him to the field. He was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find Bayard thus employed. People in tho&s;e days had not deviated from nature &s;o far as we have, and there is a pe|netrating charm which attends every action re|ferable to her. The captain &s;aw at once how
<PB N="99" REF="028632_0053_0FDA336115E5AEB0">
matters &s;tood. "This is your daughter, Cheva|ier, &s;aid he: what a charming little innocent!" and he lifted her up, and pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart. Bayard blu&s;hed, "I give you joy, my brave friend, &s;aid Palice; allow me to pay my re&s;pects to your wife.&mdash;Madame de Randan, was in &s;ome confu&s;ion, but &s;he &s;oon recovered her&s;elf, and accepted the &s;alutations of the Captain with a good grace. "You are going, &s;aid &s;he to take the Chevalier from me, and to lead him to the field of danger." "To the field of honour, Ma|dame." "The King's will &s;hall be obeyed," re|turned &s;he with a &s;igh. She went immediately and prepared with her own hands the field equipage of the Chevalier; and &s;he communicated to Bou|din, his faithful &s;quire, the &s;ecret of dre&s;&s;ing all &s;orts of wounds: with a box of medicines care|fully made up from herbs of &s;overeign virtue by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Bayard departed. Let us pa&s;s over the adieus. In the fir&s;t battle he was wounded at the be|ginning of the action: he was carried off the field and taken to the hou&s;e of per&s;ons of quali|ty, who&s;e fears he calmed by his di&s;cour&s;e, and by the precaution of placing two &s;oldiers as a guard, to whom he gave a pre&s;ent of eight hun|dred crowns as an indemnification for the pillage of the hou&s;e to which they were entitled. When his impatience to join the army rather than his cure, which was not compleated, determined
<PB N="100" REF="028632_0054_0FDA33627B982638">
him to depart, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e threw her&s;elf at his feet. "The right of war, &s;aid &s;he, makes you ma&s;ter not only of our property but of our lives; and you have &s;aved our honour: we hope however from your genero&s;ity, that you will not treat us with rigour, and that you will accept of a pre&s;ent more &s;uited to our fortune than to our gratitude. At the &s;ame time, &s;he pre&s;ented him with a box full of golden ducats. Bayard looked at her, and a&s;ked how many there were.</P>
<P>"Two thou&s;and five hundred, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he; but if yor are not &s;atisfied, we will do eve|ry thing in our power to procure &s;omething more." No, Madame, &s;aid Bayard, I will ac|cept of no money; the care you have taken of me is beyond any recompence I can make to you; I only a&s;k your friend&s;hip, and beg you to accept of mine." A moderation &s;o unu&s;ual affected the lady more with &s;urpri&s;e than with joy. She threw her&s;elf again at the Chevalier's feet, and &s;aid &s;he would not ri&s;e if he did not accept of that proof of her gratitude. "Since you will have it &s;o, &s;aid Bayard, I will not refu&s;e you; but can|not I have the honour of &s;aluting your daughters before I go?" When they came in he thanked them for their attention to him, for their com|pany and their kind endeavours to amu&s;e him in his di&s;tre&s;s. "I would willingly te&s;tify my ac|knowledgements to you, &s;aid he; but military
<PB N="101" REF="028632_0054_0FDA33627B982638">
men &s;eldom have any jewels fit for per&s;ons of your &s;ex. Your mother has made me a pre&s;ent of two thou&s;and five hundred ducats; I hope each of you will accept of a thou&s;and as an ad|dition to your dowry. I de&s;tine the remaining five hundred to the Nuns of this city who have been plundered, and I beg you will take the trouble to &s;ee them properly de&s;tributed."</P>
<P>It was thus that Bayard endeavoured to &s;often the horrors of war. But while he thus did ho|nour to his country, and was gloriou&s;ly &s;hedding his blood for the &s;tate, there were not wanting per&s;ons at court who were forming plots again&s;t his dome&s;tic peace. Certain favorites who remain|ed with Francis I, in a &s;hameful inactivity, and who attacked, at their plea&s;ure, the reputations of the brave and the beautiful, did not &s;pare the fair inhabitant of the ca&s;tle in Forte. Fran|cis chid the calumny of that quarter, but &s;till he believed more of it than he ought to have be|lieved. He loved the &s;ex, and Madame de Ran|dan was &s;o beautiful, that he grew de&s;irous of &s;eeing her; and as he was an amiable, a gallant prince, and a king, was it not natural for him to indulge &s;ome plea&s;ing hopes! but as he was ever courteous, he wrote the lady a letter in|forming her of his intention to pay her a vi&s;it with only two attendants. The lady an&s;wered re&s;pectfully, and the monarch &s;oon arrived at the
<PB N="102" REF="028632_0055_0FDA3363EDD1CC20">
ca&s;tle, where he found her ready to receive him without the court. As &s;oon as he &s;aw her he di&s;mounted, took off his hat, and coming up, pulled off his glove, then ki&s;&s;ing the hand &s;he pre&s;ented to him, led her into the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t compliments had pa&s;&s;ed and the king had refre&s;hed him&s;elf with a &s;light colla|tion, the two noblemen who attended him, on various pretences, withdrew. Francis immedi|ately began to addre&s;s the widow in a tone of gallantry, and nobody knew better how to a&s;|&s;ume the monarch or the lover as occa&s;ion requir|ed. But on finding in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e an unex|pected re&s;i&s;tence, he threw him&s;elf at the lady's feet. "Sire, &s;aid &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears, you mu&s;t have a very contemptuous opinion of me when you put your&s;elf in that humble po&s;ture before me. Have you forgotten that I am the wi|dow of Mon&s;. de Randan, who formerly render|ed you &s;uch &s;ignal &s;ervices?" The king piqued at this unexpected cata&s;trophe, forgot for a mo|ment the re&s;pect he always &s;hewed to the &s;ex. "And have you, Madam, &s;aid he, not forgot|ten M. de Randan?" The&s;e words brought a blu&s;h into the cheeks of the lady. "Ah! Sire, &s;aid &s;he, what have you been told of me?" Ma|dam, &s;aid he, in&s;tantly aware of his imprudence, and a&s;&s;uming as much re&s;pect as po&s;&s;ible, I have been told that you are as virtuous as you are fair." "I know, Sire, returned &s;he, that it is
<PB N="103" REF="028632_0055_0FDA3363EDD1CC20">
to other reports of me, that I am indebted for the honour of this vi&s;it; you have been flattered, you have been impo&s;ed upon. Yes, Sire, you have been impo&s;ed upon: it is true I have for|gotten M. de Randan; the Chevalier de Bayard is now&mdash;my hu&s;band." At the&s;e words &s;he o|pened a ca&s;ket and took out the contract of mar|riage written by the Chevalier's own hand. The king read it. "I know, &s;aid &s;he, and I am happy in thinking, that it was not the wife of Bayard that you meant to &s;educe." "No, Ma|dam, replied Francis, no; upon the honour of a gentleman, ju&s;tice &s;hall be done to your reputa|tion. I own I have been impo&s;ed on, but I &s;hall repair my fault. Bayard &s;hall always find a &s;e|cond in me when the honour of his fair &s;pou&s;e is attacked."</P>
<P>So &s;aying he &s;ummoned his attendants and mounted his hor&s;e: "Gentlemen, &s;aid he as he took leave of the lady, I have been paying a vi&s;it to the wife of the Chevalier Bayard; <HI>Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e.</HI>"</P>
<P>The lady, &s;atisfied with the manner in which this vi&s;it had terminated, waited with impatience for the return of the Chevalier; but alas! &s;he was never to &s;ee him more.</P>
<P>Innumerable faults, committed in that cam|paign by Bonnivet, to whom the king had given
<PB N="104" REF="028632_0056_0FDA336A0A04CDD8">
the command of the army, made it nece&s;&s;ary for the troops to abandon their enterpri&s;e. The flower of the French army was given in charge to Bayard, in order to &s;ecure their retreat, which he effected, but at the expence of his own life. He was mortally wounded by the &s;hot of a mu&s;|quet, then u&s;ed for the fir&s;t time; and having fallen from his hor&s;e he was carried to a little di&s;tance and laid at the foot of a tree.</P>
<P>Here, with his face turned to the enemy and his eyes fixed on the cro&s;s of his &s;word, he re|commended him&s;elf to Heaven and patiently waited his end. But did he forget Madame de Randan? No: he dictated a letter to Boudin; his whole &s;oul, tender and full of tho&s;e virtues that dignified the character of the ancient cava|liers, was poured forth in that letter. "Take, &s;aid he, take the name of Bayard, and thus ho|nour the memory of a true knight who has loved you while he lived, and who was all his life without fear and irreproachable, ever zealous for glory, faithful to his king and true to his love."</P>
<P>The con&s;table of Bourbon, as he was in pur|&s;uit of the fugitives, pa&s;&s;ed by him and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eply affected with his fate. "I am not to be pitied, &s;aid this brave man; I die in perform|ance of my duty; but it is you who de&s;erve pi|ty, who are in arms again&s;t your country, your king, your friends, your oath, your honour and
<PB N="105" REF="028632_0056_0FDA336A0A04CDD8">
your intere&s;t." At this moment a page arrived from the king with a letter for the Chevalier. By this Francis invited him to return to court that he might acknowledge his wife in public; and in con&s;ideration of his marriage, the king conferred on him the government of Burgundy. "Ah! my mo&s;t gracious liege, cried Bayard; how well do you de&s;erve the love I ever had for you! I would now die content but for the tho't of leaving a widow in de&s;pair." Pe&s;caire, the greate&s;t enemy of the French, but full of admi|ration for Bayard, had no &s;ooner learned that he was wounded than he ran to him and cried, "Ah! Chevalier, would to God I had kept you &s;afe and &s;ound as my pri&s;oner, that you might have experienced by the civilities I would have &s;hown you, how much I e&s;teem your valour and high prowe&s;s; but &s;ince there is no remedy for death, I pray God to receive your great &s;oul in|to his hands, as I am &s;ure he will." He then &s;et a guard over the Chevalier, with orders on pain of death, to defend him, and not to quit him as long as he had life. Bayard &s;oon after expired.</P>
<P>Madame de Randan, in her retirement at Ferte, was wholly employed in thinking on her honoured Lord, who&s;e return &s;he was fondly an|ticipating, without dreaming of the &s;ad tidings that were about to be announced to her.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="028632_0057_0FDA336FE33B60F0">Francis had been informed by a page of the death of the Chevalier. This con&s;iderate prince took mea&s;ures for preventing the fatal news from reaching her by &s;urpri&s;e, and went to pay her a vi&s;it that he might weep with her, and endeavor to comfort her when it &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time Palice &s;uddenly entered the ca&s;tle; the widow met him with looks of joy which &s;he &s;aw were not returned: "Alas! &s;aid &s;he, I know it, my hu&s;band is dead." "He is, &s;aid Palice; he has fallen in the field of glory; the pride of his friends, the admiration of his enemies. He recommended you to Heaven with his late&s;t breath, and his la&s;t reque&s;t was that you would live for the &s;ake of his child."</P>
<P>The widow made a &s;ign to Palice to leave her alone for a few moments; after which &s;he &s;ent for her child, took her in her arms, and ki&s;&s;ed her; then recommending her to the care of the king and of Palice, &s;he fell back in her chair and expired.</P>

<P>As they were mutually attached to each other in con&s;equence of the &s;incere&s;t mutual affection, they reciprocally endeavored to oblige each o|ther on every occa&s;ion; but as all &s;ublunary en|joyments mu&s;t have their alloy, the happine&s;s of this affectionate pair began at la&s;t to dimini&s;h, and each grew le&s;s &s;olicitous to plea&s;e: They felt the &s;ame affectionate regard for each other, but it wanted its fir&s;t animation!

agreeable, was &s;ometimes rather haughty and ca|pricious. The delicate apprehen&s;ion of giving offence in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, gradually wore off, they took le&s;s pains to conceal their re&s;pec|tive foibles, and at length, from mere inattention and negligence, &s;uffered them to appear in as &s;trong a light as their good qualities.&mdash;This un|plea&s;ant rever&s;ion became di&s;gu&s;ting to both par|ties, and gave birth to little cavals and di&s;putes, which naturally prompted them to vent their di&s;|quiets to a third per&s;on.</P>
<P>Amelia's confidant was her &s;i&s;ter, younger than her&s;elf and of a lively plea&s;ant di&s;po&s;ition, too much attached to her &s;i&s;ter not to condemn her brother's behaviour, &s;he very kindly however, &s;trove to bring about a reconciliation between them. Of a different and an oppo&s;ite temper was the confidential friend of Celadon&mdash;a man of family, nearly of his own age, young, fond of women, (av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e to marriage) artful and de&s;ign|ing. Of John&s;on's real intentions Celadon's frankne&s;s harboured not the lea&s;t idea; but Char|lotte &s;u&s;pected the &s;incerity of his favored friend.

<P>Neville was not only an agreeable but a wor|thy young man, but not having &s;een &s;o much of the world as tho&s;e with whom he now re&s;ided, and their acquaintance; he was not at fir&s;t aware of John&s;on's character, he &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed from the air of gallantry in his behaviour to Char|lotte, that he intended to make honorable propo|&s;als to her, though he was always ridiculing ma|trimony to him.</P>
<P>Neville &s;oon conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for Charlotte, which made his unea&s;ine&s;s great with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egard to John&s;on, who had a very attractive ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erior, which the general turn of his carriage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fair-&s;ex, greatly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in his fa|vor.

win a heart which he &s;hould, he imagined, find it extremely difficult to obtain. However, though Charlotte outwardly di&s;covered no particular favor for Neville, &s;he very clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a moral, view, from John&s;on; but &s;he was &s;ome|what afraid le&s;t the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er might, from his in&s;inu|ating manners, prevail on the former to become as fini&s;hed a libertine as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Celadon indeed &s;aw not John&s;on in his true co|lours, yet he was far from thinking as he did up|on any &s;ubject of a very intere&s;ting nature: He &s;till loved his wife with a &s;incere affection; though their di&s;putes had weakened the force of his fir&s;t ardour; yet he was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the value of dome&s;tic felicity, to wi&s;h for its re|turn; for that he often &s;ighed, hourly lamented the change di&s;cernable in his lady, and the change which he felt in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By a di&s;pute in which they were one day warm|ly engaged, concerning their little &s;on, the breach between them was con&s;iderably widened. Cela|don, in direct oppo&s;ition to his wife's judgment, took him from her, at an age when boys u&s;ually remain under the tuition of the female part of the family, in order to place him at a boarding &s;chool, though his own fondne&s;s could &s;carcely brook the &s;eperation&mdash;Amelia, on the other hand, who loved her hu&s;band's likene&s;s in mini|ature, &s;ighed at the ab&s;ence of her amiable little
<PB N="112" REF="028632_0060_0FDA3376A5DA8D40">
Harry, but knew that her &s;olicitations for his return would be to no purpo&s;e; dome&s;tic debates at length became &s;o frequent, and &s;o fierce, that the former began to drop hints about a &s;epara|tion: Amelia, though &s;he trembled at the &s;ound of that word, was too proud to let him who ut|tered it &s;ee that it affected her.</P>
<P>John&s;on, who was ever upon the watch, and ever &s;piriting up his friend to proceed with the greate&s;t violence, determined to &s;eize this very favourable opportunity (as he imagined) to pay his court to Amelia, re&s;olving at the &s;ame time, to prevent Neville from forming an alliance with Charlotte. To facilitate the execution of the la&s;t de&s;ign, and prompted al&s;o by his con&s;umate vanity, he carele&s;sly hinted one day, that he was &s;ure of the heart of Amelia, and that he had no doubts with regard to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;i&s;ter's, whenever he &s;hould have lei&s;ure to to attempt &s;uch a conque&s;t: This bold a&s;&s;ertion ju&s;tly rai&s;ed Neville's indignation, and he threa|tened to acquaint each party with what he had delivered.</P>
<P>John&s;on an&s;wered him fir&s;t with a loud laugh, and then dared him to the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o capital a folly, as he called it, a&s;&s;uring him that there was nothing particular in what he had af|firmed, as all people who knew any thing of life, thought and acted preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner?
<PB N="113" REF="028632_0060_0FDA3376A5DA8D40">
adding, that he would make him&s;elf appear in the mo&s;t ridiculous light, by publi&s;hing any thing of his ru&s;tic and ob&s;olete notions, which were quite contrary to the ton.</P>
<P>Neville, who had by this time formed his plan, made a &s;hort reply: He then left him and went in &s;earch of Charlotte, whom he found ready to reproach him for his attachment to John&s;on, and who declared, that &s;he had a wor&s;e opinion of him than of any other man in the world.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported at this declaration, which cofim|ed the fal&s;ity of John&s;on's a&s;&s;ertions, he &s;eized that moment to tell every thing he had been &s;ay|ing, and to pre&s;s his &s;uit with more ardour than ever. She gave him in return the mo&s;t flattering encouragement, but not 'till he had promi&s;ed her to break off all connexions with John&s;on, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in paving the way for a reconciliation between her brother and &s;i&s;ter; vindicating the latter in the warme&s;t terms, and a&s;&s;uring her lo|ver, that whatever faults &s;he had, they all pro|ceeded from an exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, and from an uncommon delicacy of di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;he was afraid had been carried too far.</P>
<P>Highly plea&s;ed with having put things in this promi&s;ing train, &s;he flew to her &s;i&s;ter, and inform|ed her of all &s;he had learnt from Neville, who
<PB N="114" REF="028632_0061_0FDA33789024C830">
would, &s;he was certain, endeavour to make her hu&s;band &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;takes into which he he had been led by John&s;on, his fal&s;e friend in every &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>Amelia thanked her &s;i&s;ter for her information: and a&s;ked her if &s;he thought the interpo&s;ition of her little Harry might not al&s;o be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice: "Though we have long cea&s;ed to be fond of each other," continued &s;he, "we both dote on our child, I will go and fetch him this moment from &s;chool; Celadon cannot be offend|ed at my love for my dear boy; when he has made us friends, he may be &s;ent again to &s;chool if his father chu&s;es it." Accordingly &s;he &s;et out with her &s;i&s;ter, but when &s;he arrived at the &s;chool, &s;he was told, that Celadon, accompani|ed by Mr. Neville, had ju&s;t carried her &s;on away. The latter of the&s;e gentlemen, indeed, had pre|vailed on the former to li&s;ten to rea&s;on, and to be reconciled to his lady, who had been ba&s;ely mi&s;|repre&s;ented to him by John&s;on, who&s;e infamous de&s;igns, both upon her and her &s;i&s;ter, were no longer of a que&s;tionable nature.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Celadon was convinced of the fal&s;|hood of his pretended friend, he began to doubt whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Amelia who had been, he was tho|roughly &s;en&s;ible, very ill treated by him, would ever forgive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m. Upon his expre&s;&s;ing this ap|prehen&s;ion, Neville told him that the &s;ight of her
<PB N="115" REF="028632_0061_0FDA33789024C830">
&s;on would, in his opinion, di&s;arm her re&s;entment. The little fellow was rejoiced to come home.&mdash; On his eagerly flying to look for his mamma, Celadon &s;topped him, and bade him conceal him|&s;elf in the clo&s;et till he &s;ent for him; the boy whimpered and obeyed: In the mean while Ame|lia and Charlotte returned very much di&s;&s;atisfied from the &s;chool.</P>
<P>Charlotte, by que&s;tioning the &s;ervants clo&s;ely, &s;oon found out the little Harry, and brought him privately to his mother. While &s;he was care&s;&s;ing him, John&s;on, who began to &s;u&s;pect that he was found out, but who al&s;o believed he had &s;till &s;uf|ficient power to impo&s;e on Celadon, came and di&s;covered him with Neville. Very &s;oon af|ter his arrival, Amelia, followed by her &s;i&s;ter, led in Harry, and bade him regain his father's heart for her. Celadon could not immediately recover from his &s;urpri&s;e and embarra&s;&s;ment, e|&s;pecially as John&s;on &s;tood clo&s;e at his elbow, &s;ti|mulating him to reject every offer towards a re|conciliation; but the mode&s;t appearance and ten|der behaviour of Amelia, a recollection of eve|ry thing that Neville had told him, and the &s;ight of his engaging child, who di&s;covered the great|e&s;t fondne&s;s both for him and his mother, quite &s;oftened his heart. He embraced his wife and child with unutterable tran&s;port, and then turn|ing to John&s;on, forbade him the hou&s;e. He
<PB N="116" REF="028632_0062_0FDA3379B8DECEB0">
quitted it in a rage, and Charlotte gave her hand to Neville &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Celadon and Amelia, now as &s;en&s;ible of their own errors as of John&s;on's criminal conduct, were perfectly reconciled, and the revival pro|mi&s;ed a la&s;ting &s;ource of their connubial happi|ne&s;s.</P>

I intended to have gone a few miles farther before I had &s;topt, but, as I find my&s;elf exceedingly fatigued, I cheerfully accept of your friendly invitation. So &s;aying, he ro&s;e and followed Mr. T&mdash; to his villa.</P>
<P>You are a &s;tranger, I &s;uppo&s;e, in this part of the country? &s;aid Mr. T&mdash;. I was born at a vallage no great di&s;tance from this; I believe, however, very few here will now know me, I am much altered, be&s;ides I am poor: I have brought nothing home with me but a few &s;cars, re|ceived in the &s;ervice of my country, looking at: &s;tump, the remains of his left arm.

<P>My mother died when I was but a boy, my father remained a widower: Though but little acquainted with the world, or the &s;ciences, by a clo&s;e attention to nature he acquired &s;ome of the mo&s;t important principles of u&s;eful knowledge; The cultivation of his little farm afforded him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n agreeable exerci&s;e, the enjoyment of a &s;elect circle of friends &s;ufficiently occupied his lei&s;ure hours: He early impre&s;&s;ed me with the princi|ples of virtue; my mind, naturally &s;u&s;ceptible, from his example, acquired a reli&s;h for &s;ocial en+joyments: As he intended me to &s;ucceed him in his property and profe&s;&s;ion, he took care to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne an education &s;uitable to &s;uch a &s;tation. At the grammar-&s;chool of our pari&s;h I contracted an intimacy with a lad about my own age, the &s;on of a gentleman in our neighbourhood; this connexion in time advanced to a mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip,</P>
<P>Having one day taken the diver&s;ion of hunt|ing, the pur&s;uit of our game carried us f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther from home than we intended; hunger reminded
<PB N="120" REF="028632_0064_0FDA33842133F448">
us that it was dinner time; I carried Mr. Willi|ams, which was the name of my friend, to the hou&s;e of a widow lady in that neighbourhood, where I had before once vi&s;ited. We were receiv|ed in the polite&s;t manner. It was then I was fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;ight of my Maria! Ble&s;&s;ed did I &s;ay? No &s;urely, it de&s;erves another appel|lation, &s;ince it proved the commencement of my misfortunes. I will not attempt to di&s;cribe this lovely maid, any repre&s;entation I could delineate would fall infinitely &s;hort of the original. Her charms in&s;pired me with the &s;incere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and I had every rea&s;on to think it mutual. Oh! I was mi&s;taken, &s;he was not &s;incere; at lea&s;t, &s;he was not proof again&s;t the &s;olicitations of another.</P>
<P>By permi&s;&s;ion of my father, whom I had made acquaintaned with the whole matter, I went one day to vi&s;it her. At my arrival I found the fa|mily in the utmo&s;t di&s;order; Maria was mi&s;&s;ing! She had gone the day before on a vi&s;it to a lady, who re&s;ided at a little di&s;tance, and had not from that time been heard of. I was &s;o &s;truck with this intelligence, that I remained for &s;ome time in a manner in&s;en&s;ible; I &s;oon however recollect|ed my&s;elf: Concluding &s;he mu&s;t have been forced away, I re&s;olved not to loo&s;e a moment in at|tempting her recovery. I di&s;patched a &s;hort note to my father, and one to my friend, briefly ac|quainting him with what had happened, direct|ing him to take a different route from that which
<PB N="121" REF="028632_0064_0FDA33842133F448">
I intended, and appointing a place where to meet. This done, I took leave of the family.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent the day in fruitle&s;s inquiries, I arrived late at night at the place of rendezvous, Mr. Williams was not come; I waited with im|patience till next morning. Have you heard any thing of Maria? cried I, as &s;oon as he appeared. &mdash;I have&mdash;Where is &s;he?&mdash;At Mr. O&s;burn's&mdash;I &s;tretched forth my arms to embrace him. Re|pre&s;s your joy, Edmund, &s;aid he this di&s;covery only adds to your misfortunes.&mdash;What do you mean?&mdash;She is there by her own choice!&mdash;Im|po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;That will but too well convince you of its reality, &s;aid he, puting a letter into my hand, which he &s;aid he received from her&s;elf. I tore it open&mdash;its contents informed me, that &s;he had particular rea&s;ons for di&s;continuing her corre&s;|pondence with me, and at the &s;ame time advi&s;ing me to think no more of her. The letter drop|ped from my hand, I &s;tood for &s;ome time mo|tionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e: I had, it is true, never before &s;een her hand writing, but I had the ut|mo&s;t confidence in my friend. Come, Mr. Wil|liams, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t &s;ee the faithle&s;s Maria once more; I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the plea&s;ure of pun|i&s;hing her &s;educer.&mdash;Take care, &s;aid he, that in|&s;tead of cha&s;tening your rival, you do not re|ceive an additional injury: You know he is a profe&s;&s;ed libertine; A man who can commit a

crime like this, will not he&s;itate to crown it with another, perhaps of a wor&s;e nature. I remain|ed firm to my purpo&s;e. Having found I was de|termined, he agreed to accompany me. When we were within a little di&s;tance of Mr. O&s;burn's he &s;aid, it was thro' one of the dome&s;tics of the family, with whom he had a &s;light acquaintance, he had got acce&s;s to Maria; and if I plea&s;ed, he would go a little before and endeavour to pro|cure me an interview by the &s;ame method. I approved of his propo&s;al. He was hardly out of &s;ight, when &s;everal men ru&s;hed &s;uddenly from, a concealment, one of them &s;eized my hor&s;e by the bridle; while I &s;truck at him with the but end of my whip, I received a blow on my head which brought me &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. When I recovered I found my&s;elf in a paltry looking apartment, &s;urrounded by a number of fellows, who&s;e countenances told me I had no good to ex|pect from them. I a&s;ked them the meaning of all this, and was an&s;wered, I &s;hould know that in proper time. I was &s;oon after forced into a car|riage, one of the fellows placed on each &s;ide of me carried to Port&s;mouth, and put on board a tran&s;port which &s;ailed next day for Germany.</P>
<P>Time will not permit me to relate particularly the various circum&s;tances which happened dur|ing the different campaigns in which I have &s;erv|ed. Surrounded by the enemy, I &s;hould cer+tainly have fallen a victim to their ferocity, had

not Mr. Dougla&s;s, who perceived my &s;ituation, come to my relief. The victory was glorious, it was deci&s;ive, but I lo&s;t my friend: He was cer|tainly killed, or at lea&s;t taken pri&s;oner, for from that hour to this I never could learn what be|came of him. The lo&s;s of &s;o much blood, and a long and tedious recovery, made a return to my native country nece&s;&s;ary, in order to re|cruit my debilitated con&s;titution. In the bo&s;om of a parent, in the company of my friend, Mr. Williams, I now expect to find a &s;olace to my affliction: This remaining happine&s;s, how is it embittered by the recollection of Maria, once the &s;um of my felicity, and &s;cource of my mi&s;e|ry; now, as I was long &s;ince but too well in|formed, hid in the &s;hades of death for ever from my view!</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid Mr. T&mdash;, you expect the highe&s;t plea&s;ure from the enjoyment of your friend.&mdash;I do indeed: Oh, how &s;weet at this moment is the recollection of our pa&s;t endearments, how plea&s;|ing the hope of their revival.&mdash;How vain is &s;uch a hope! Him you call your friend is the blacke&s;t villain.&mdash;What do you &s;ay? &s;aid Edmund, with a look of a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation, you cer|tainly do not know him.&mdash;I &s;hould indeed be a&s;hamed of &s;uch an acquaintance; you may how|ever be a&s;&s;ured of what I tell you, that he is the ba&s;e&s;t of villains and the wor&s;t enemy you ever had.&mdash;My enemy, exclaimed Edmund, what do

<P>Know then, Williams betrayed you and your Maria! Excited by a guilty pa&s;&s;ion, and finding her proof again&s;t every delu&s;ive art, he found means to carry her off by force. The letter he brought you was a ba&s;e forgery: In ca&s;e you &s;hould be inclined to examine more fully in|to the matter, as he apprehended you would, he hired tho&s;e ruffians, who carried you away in the manner you have your&s;elf related. I need &s;ay no more; this is the truth of the matter; for the confirmation of which I can produce the mo&s;t undeniable proof, if you demand it.&mdash;Edmund trembled and turned pale; a thou&s;and minute circum&s;tances now ru&s;hed on his memory, which tended to &s;hake, in &s;ome degree, the confidence he had placed in his friend &mdash;Mr. T&mdash; perceiv|ed his di&s;tre&s;s, and attempted to &s;oothe the agi|tations of his mind.&mdash;May I be allowed, &s;aid Edmund, to a&s;k you, by what means you be|came acquainted with tho&s;e circum&s;tances.&mdash;You behold in me the father of the unfortunate Ma|ria.&mdash;The father of Maria! cried Edmund, in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and can you behold with &s;uch a placid countenance, the wretch, who has, tho' unintentionally, been the occa&s;ion of her misfortunes?&mdash;You was deceived, you was cruel|ly

di&s;abled from di&s;covering the deception. The lady with whom Maria re&s;ided, continued Mr. T&mdash;, is my &s;i&s;ter; &s;he wrote me concerning your vi&s;its, and her apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences: The day after receiving her letter I &s;et out to &s;ee my daughter; I had not got half way when I was alarmed with cries from a carriage which drove pa&s;t; fortunately I had brought a &s;ervant along with me, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I re&s;cued my child. We returned home: I que&s;tioned Ma|ria concerning your corre&s;pondence with her; &s;he gave me a circum&s;tantial detail of the matter, concluding with an account of her being &s;eized and carried off by two men, whom &s;he had nev|er &s;een before, not a quarter of a mile from her aunt's hou&s;e. I was inclined to think this to be a contrivance of yours, and not hearing any more of you, confirmed me in that opinion. It was but very lately I was undeceived: A &s;evere illne&s;s produced a confe&s;&s;ion, of the whole affair, from the wretch whom you fondly call your friend.</P>

<HEAD>THE HONOURABLE SEDUCER: OR, HISTORY OF OLIVIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(Extracted from the life of an unfortunate female.)</HEAD>
<P>OLIVIA was born in a remote part of En|gland, and was the elde&s;t daughter of pa|rents who lived in a &s;tile of gentility be&s;peaking competence indeed, but not affluence. As the family was numerous, much &s;he could not expect to be proportioned with; but if her pecuniary expectations were &s;lender, nature &s;eemed to com|pen&s;ate for the want of wealth, by trea&s;uring in her per&s;on every female charm, which ought perhaps to be con&s;idered rather as a misfortune than an advantage, &s;ince it lays us the more open to &s;eduction; add to this, her being mi&s;tre&s;s of many polite accompli&s;hments, with a heart form|ed in nature's mo&s;t delicate mould, endued with a &s;en&s;ibility too exqui&s;ite to guard again&s;t the &s;nares of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="028632_0068_0FDA3390C4FC1B98">At the age of &s;eventeen &s;he left the &s;chool, and lived under the eye of a mother, who&s;e fond|ne&s;s for her &s;he requited with every token of fi|lial affection. Many were her admirers, but no &s;uitor appeared among&s;t them; no lure, however, was thrown out, no extravagance of dre&s;s indul|ged in to a&s;&s;i&s;t her native attractions; indeed &s;he &s;eemed "when unadorned, adorned the mo&s;t."</P>
<P>A ball given upon &s;ome public occa&s;ion was the fir&s;t opportunity that offered for introducing her to the public eye. Among the company pre&s;ent was a &s;tudent belonging to one of the Univer&s;ities, and then on a vi&s;it to &s;ome per&s;on of note in that part of the country. His addre&s;s was genteel, his per&s;on elegant; he hoped the plea&s;ure of being her partner for the evening, and was gratified: An acquaintance from that moment and circum&s;tance commenced, which led to overtures of a tender kind.</P>
<P>The re&s;pectable connexions, and honourable views he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have, added to the unbounded confidence placed in Olivia's di&s;|cretion by her parents, made them indifferent a|bout the addre&s;&s;es paid to her without their con|&s;ent; and, indeed, &s;uch a &s;anction is a needle&s;s ceremony where the affections of the child has been previou&s;ly be&s;towed, as was her ca&s;e; her heart was di&s;po&s;ed of but not without an equiva|lent, his was given in exchange; yet no propo|&s;al
<PB N="130" REF="028632_0069_0FDA3391A6E61588">
of marriage was made, and an union of hands, which di&s;arms the cen&s;orious, was unthought of by either in the delirium of happine&s;s they were in, as if no moment could be borrowed for that end from the time they &s;pent in the interchange of every token of unfeigned affection.</P>
<P>Olivia was at la&s;t waked from this lethargy of love, but not until the fear of di&s;honor had re|moved the mi&s;t from her eyes. She propo&s;ed a day on which he was to &s;olicit the concurrence of her parents to their nuptials; her propo&s;al was received with demon&s;trations of unabated ar|dour; but, he that had been &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in his attendance till then, ab&s;ented him&s;elf that day and returned to the pur&s;uit of his &s;tudies without even taking leave of her family, by whom he had been always treated with re&s;pect and ho&s;pi|tality. They were &s;urpri&s;ed; &s;he, as may be imagined, was alarmed, the more as he depart|ed after having triumphed over that which gives dignity to love, and to native beauty an addi|tional lu&s;tre. She was in an agony of de&s;pair, which di&s;covered it in the effects it had upon her health. Her mother marked the progre&s;s of a pain that undermined her daughter's peace, and endeavored to alleviate it by arguments calculated to comfort her under her di&s;appointments, all of which failed of the end propo&s;ed. She did not &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e of her daughter's affliction to be &s;o &s;erious as it was; yet finding her continue

di&s;con&s;olate, &s;he urged her not with the authori|ty, but the tenderne&s;s of a fond parent, to be explicit in revealing the minute&s;t circum&s;tances relative to her &s;ituation. Poor Olivia's tongue faultered in the attempt, but at la&s;t, after having confe&s;&s;ed a partiality for Mr. &mdash;, (which was vi&s;ible enough) owned the advantage that had been taken of it, with an ingeniou&s;ne&s;s that &s;hewed &s;elf-gratification had not made her &s;werve from the path of virtue &s;o much as her inability to refu&s;e to the man &s;he loved the la&s;t pledge of her ardent pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P>Having got over the painful ta&s;k of &s;elf-accu|&s;ation, &s;he &s;wooned in the arms of her afflicted parent, who&s;e &s;ituation &s;eemed now as pitiable as her child's; yet, &s;en&s;ibly as &s;he was affected by the idea of her Olivia's ruin, and the di&s;grace that would inevitably be reflected on a family hitherto unblemi&s;hed, &s;he forbore to torture with unavailing reproaches a brea&s;t already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acked with the mo&s;t poignant feelings; and after hav|ing di&s;clo&s;ed the heart-rending &s;ecret to her hu&s;|band, it was re&s;olved, as the be&s;t expedient to bani&s;h the melancholy which might endanger the rea&s;on or health of a child &s;till dear to them, as well as to place her beyond the reach of malev|olent a&s;per&s;ions, to &s;end her to London, whither &s;he &s;oon after came, and was apprenticed to a miliner. Here &s;he found me, and di&s;burdened her heart of part of its &s;orrow, by making me privy to its &s;ecrets.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="028632_0070_0FDA339365EDF9E8">Not long after &s;he had been in town, a mi&s;|carriage was the con&s;equence of a ha&s;ty and fa|tiguing journey; during the illne&s;s that attended it, I was happy enough to endear my&s;elf to her by every little kind office in my power to do her, which &s;he was grateful for, and returned on ev|ery occa&s;ion, until a <HI>faux pas</HI> threw me at a di&s;|tance from her; &s;hame would not have been my portion had I followed her example, which was &s;trictly virtuous.

<P>In the mean time he had returned to that part of the country whence he &s;o abruptly departed, and made many fruitle&s;s enquiries; and being di&s;appointed in his re&s;earches, as his cour&s;e of ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ical learning was compleated, he returned to the metropolis, and re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of his mother, a widow lady of fortune and fa&s;hion. A &s;ettled gloom appeared on his countenance, which &s;he could not account for, and in order to di&s;pel it, &s;he advi&s;ed him to travel; agreeably to her advice, he prepared for his tour, and having been to make &s;ome farewel vi&s;its, one evening overtook a genteel girl with a band-box in her hand, whom he politely acco&s;ted, but without being able to extort a word from her;
<PB N="133" REF="028632_0070_0FDA339365EDF9E8">
&s;till he followed, and &s;he, to get rid of his im|portunity, beckoned a coach off a &s;tand, while he li&s;tening to learn the place of her re&s;idence, after he had heard her voice, exclaimed, "Gra|cious Heaven! 'tis &s;he, 'tis my Olivia&mdash;I have lo&s;t her again!"</P>
<P>At his return, his mother told him &s;he expect|ed every moment from the miliner's &s;ome arti|cles which &s;he intended as a pre&s;ent for him. The words were hardly uttered when a footman brought word that a young woman from the mil|liner's was in the next room, and waited her plea&s;ure; "Let me &s;ee the ruffles and frills I be&s;poke," &s;aid the lady, upon which he brought in a box that excited a &s;trange emotion in the young gentleman; indeed he thought it could be no other than the one his fair fugitive carried, and &s;he being de&s;ired to walk in, as &s;oon as they recognized each other, &s;he fainted, which had an effect upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im little &s;hort of frenzy; however, the my&s;tery was &s;oon unravelled&mdash;and he, in&s;tead of travelling, conjured his mother, if &s;he valued his happine&s;s, to con&s;ent to their union, which in a few days after took place.</P>
<P>After having given his beloved Livy the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of the &s;incerity of his attach|ment in an union c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ented by mutual affection, the delicacy of his &s;entiments which was intend|ed

by nature to enhance all enjoyments, was, however, a bar to the exqui&s;ite happine&s;s he promi&s;ed him&s;elf, as he &s;ecretly upbraided him|&s;elf with the gratification of a pa&s;&s;ion, which, though he had atoned for to the daughter, mu&s;t &s;till, he thought, be remembered with angui&s;h by her parents; and to alleviate the di&s;quietude their fondne&s;s for her would probably prolong, was a duty that honour, as well as the relation|&s;hip he now &s;tood in to them, rendered indi&s;|pen&s;ible: His fir&s;t care, therefore, after a tu|mult of joy that &s;ucceeded an event as unexpect|ed as it was coveted, had &s;ub&s;ided, was to pre|pare for a vi&s;it to that part of the kingdom in which they re&s;ided, in order to a reconciliation.</P>
<P>Olivia's concurrence, you may imagine, was ea&s;ily obtained to an excur&s;ion that originated from &s;o generous a motive, exclu&s;ive of the plea&s;ure &s;he hoped to feel in her parents retract|ing their opinion of him on whom &s;he had fixed her affections: Vanity, in &s;ome degree, cleave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the be&s;t of us, and what can be &s;o &s;oothing to it as to be deemed capable of making a prudent choice at Olivia's age, in a concern &s;o precari|ous as matrimony, wherein &s;o many of our &s;ex, in particular, are apt to be un&s;ucce&s;sful. Their intended journey, and the object of it, were no &s;ooner propo&s;ed to the old lady for her approba|tion that &s;he acquie&s;ced in the propriety of the purpo&s;e; not without applauding the generous
<PB N="135" REF="028632_0071_0FDA339515EE7C98">
principle that actuated her &s;on upon this occa&s;ion, for in what regarded an inviolable fidelity to the fair&s;ex, uninfluenced by lucrative con&s;iderations, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed an enthu&s;ia&s;m that would have done credit to the days of chivalry. To give the whole weight of her &s;anction to a mea&s;ure &s;he &s;o highly approved of, &s;he not only in&s;i&s;ted on their mak|ing u&s;e of her equipage on the occa&s;ion, in token of her re&s;pect towards her daughter-in-law, as well as in te&s;timony of her hearty con&s;ent to their nuptials, &s;he re&s;olved to accompany the young couple, thereby adding much to the &s;atis|faction of their journey; which accordingly took place, after &s;ufficient time had been allowed for acquainting Olivia's parents and kindred what vi&s;itants they were &s;hortly to expect.</P>
<P>Olivia, urged by the impul&s;e of a &s;anguine temper, natural to youth, was for &s;urpri&s;ing the old folks with the happy vici&s;&s;itude of her for|tune, and elevating their &s;pirits with a jerk, as &s;ud|denly as they had been depre&s;&s;ed; "No child," remon&s;trated the old lady; "your dutiful di&s;po|&s;ition, and tender concern for them, mu&s;t not mi&s;guide you in pre&s;cribing &s;o violent a reme|dy to blunt the edge of &s;orrow: let not your youth envy my maturer years the con&s;olation of knowing by experience what will be be&s;t receiv|ed by tho&s;e of riper years, and what, indeed, is propere&s;t for any &s;tage of life under the like cir|cum&s;tances; I mean a gradual, at lea&s;t a previ|ous

Great as was Olivia's impatience to be the me&s;&s;enger of com|fort to her afflicted parents, &s;he had too great a &s;hare of under&s;tanding not to allow the impropri|ety of bur&s;ting upon them with the full &s;plendour of happine&s;s, before a letter had, in part, di&s;|pelled the cloud of melancholy with which they were overca&s;t, and relinquin&s;hed her de&s;ire with becoming re&s;ignation, to the will and advice of her mother-in-law, who, unwilling to put Olivi|a's patience to a trial, too &s;evere, retarded their journey but for a week. This was keeping Oli|via a tedious fortnight from a place whither her eager wi&s;hes had flown before her, for the journey could not be performed in le&s;s than a week. In the mean while, a letter reached the man&s;ion of her father, who immediately di&s;patched the glad tid|ings to his wife, then at Bath, where &s;he had been advi&s;ed to &s;pend &s;ome time to recruit her health and &s;pirits; he had the &s;ame time hinted a de&s;ire that, if her health would permit, &s;he would not a moment delay her return, which he by no means would have in&s;inuated, were he not con|vinced that all the &s;anitive properties a&s;cribed to that fa&s;hionable rendezvous of infirmity, would

<P>This amiable young lady, with her hu&s;band and mother, had arrived within a few &s;tages of the town that gave her birth, anticipatig the hap|py meeting, and reviewing in Fancy's gla&s;s, &s;cenes which &s;he had every rea&s;on to hope would &s;oon be realized, when an event happened that deranged in an in&s;tant all her immagination had been framing during the journey.&mdash;A loud &s;hriek was heard to proceed from a &s;tage coach that &s;topped at the inn where they were changing hor&s;es, a &s;omething like &s;ympathy made Olivia return it; her hu&s;band &s;hared her emotion, for they were united in every &s;en&s;e of the word, and what di&s;compo&s;ed her, was conveyed to him by that ivi&s;ible link which couples hearts in uni&s;on, one with the other as no untoward accident was known to cau&s;e the alarm, you will &s;uppo&s;e, I make no doubt, that either Olivia's &s;en&s;ibility made her feel for the per&s;on whom &s;he thought a &s;ufferer, or that &s;ome former acquaintance of her's, unable to &s;uppre&s;s her joy on having a tran&s;ient view of one &s;he recognized, vented it in the foregoing manner: indeed, the &s;hriek was uttered by no other than Olivia's mother, whom chance led to the inn at &s;o critical a juncture, and who&s;e well-known voice thrilled through the bo|&s;om

<P>Sir Thomas Ward was his favorite. That gentleman had an engaging addre&s;s, and a &s;educ|tive wit. He was a mo&s;t eloquent profe&s;&s;or of vice, a mo&s;t powerful advocate of plea&s;ure; for he had the art of giving a prevailing charm to every &s;ubject he undertook to defend.

<P>This nobleman, after having been agreeably entertained at dinner with his companions, his head full of voluptuous images, was walking alone in one of the vi&s;tas of his park. It led him, in&s;en&s;ibly, to the hou&s;e of one of his ten|ants who&s;e name was Adams.</P>
<P>Lord Whatley was &s;truck with the figure of a girl who &s;eemed to be about &s;ixteen, and was one of the farmer's younge&s;t daughters Ireland, &s;o boa&s;ted for beauties, never produced &s;o fine a creature. Fanny was literally an angel from heaven; the dignity of her mind was di&s;played in her countenance, and mode&s;ty gave a deeper blu&s;h to the ro&s;es on her cheek. Her mouth,

This compliment, or rather this real expre&s;&s;ion of what he felt, &s;oon found its way to the heart of Fanny.&mdash;Her fine complexion a&s;|&s;umed a deeper blu&s;h. Her parents had not heard the an&s;wer his lord&s;hip had made her.&mdash; Upon his return home, he gave the flowers a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them as if he had been &s;peaking to Fanny. The ba|ronet did not fail to treat him like a Celadon, or an Artemenes. My dear friend, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t certainly have read tho&s;e piteous French ro|mances. You mu&s;t never &s;hew your face in Lon|don; you will be pointed at as you pa&s;s along the &s;treet. I thought you would have made an incomparable Lovelace, but you are Menalcas by a fountain &s;ide.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas accompanied his friend to the far|mer's. He &s;aw Fanny. He was di&s;concerted; he had need of the whole force of his wit and humour to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;troke that
<PB N="144" REF="028632_0076_0FDA33A164C40878">
had wounded Whatley. He attempts to addre&s;s him&s;elf in the language of the town to the re&s;|pectable villager. She &s;peaks. He is in confu|&s;ion. Sir Thomas, at length, re&s;umes his plea|&s;antry. He retires to have &s;ome private conver|&s;ation with Adams&punc; The worthy old man re|turns, lifting up his eyes to heaven, di&s;tracted, pale, ready to &s;ink into the ground, death in his countenance. Go, my children. Ah, my lord! throwing him&s;elf with folded hands, and &s;treaming eyes, at the feet of Whatley, what have I done, that you have &s;worn my ruin and di&s;grace? That gentleman, &s;aid he, my dear, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his wife, and pointing to the baronet, has offered me money to give up Fanny to my lord. To think us capable of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s, of pro&s;tituting the dear child we have brought up!&mdash;Take our lives, my lord, but leave us our honour; it is the only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we have. Are we then no longer worthy to be your &s;ervants? You, you then, had no &s;uch de|&s;ign. It is you, &s;ir, who have given his lord|&s;hip &s;uch coun&s;el as this. Alas! what would my lord his father have &s;aid? He treated us like his children.</P>
<P>No, my dear Adams, interrupted Whatley, I never had any &s;uch horrid idea. This is the in|&s;ufferable plea&s;antry of my friend. Set your heart at ea&s;e. Certainly, my lord, an&s;wered he, I never could apprehend that you &s;hould &s;o far
<PB N="145" REF="028632_0076_0FDA33A164C40878">
forget your former goodne&s;s to the grateful crea|tures that are always ble&s;&s;ing you. As to you, &s;ir, &s;aid he, turning to &s;ir Thomas, I mu&s;t tell you, that if the&s;e are your plea&s;antries, they are very vile ones; we may be poor, but we have a &s;en&s;e of honour as well as you. If one of my equals, added he, with a voice choaked up with grief, had made me &s;uch an infamous propo&s;al, I &s;hould have gone to the&s;e extremities which have now been prevented by re&s;pect. I tell you once more, my dear Adams, my friend did not mean to in&s;ult you; he was only in je&s;t; I a&s;k your pardon for him; and he goes.</P>
<P>Do you a&s;k pardon for me, &s;aid Sir Thomas? Undoubtedly, and you ought to a&s;k it of the meane&s;t per&s;on you have offended; then he is our &s;uperior, our ma&s;ter. How cruel to be the occa&s;ion of my &s;ufferings! you have offended the father of Fanny.</P>
<P>I have de&s;cribed Whatley, as one of tho&s;e young lords, that conceal all their defects under the varni&s;h of politene&s;s. I am not now incon|&s;i&s;tent;&mdash;but love works miracles. It had made of a frivolous and in&s;olent lord, a timorous and re&s;pectful lover; and had opened his mind to the influences of virtue. The complaints of poor Adams had vexed him, and Sir Thomas mu&s;t have been connected with him in the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy,
<PB N="146" REF="028632_0077_0FDA33A71E622320">
as the conduct of that worthle&s;s man of fa&s;hion was not followed by an open rupture.</P>
<P>Whatley was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. He adored Fanny, yet he did not dare to &s;ee her. He was equally afraid of &s;eeing the father and daughter. His friends dragged him to London, and plunged him once more in all tho&s;e fa&s;hionable follies and ex|travagancies, which the world calls plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Adams, from that moment, had lo&s;t that chearfulne&s;s which is the happy portion of the inhabitants of the country. He was not &s;atisfied with lord Whatley's promi&s;es. He looked upon his daughter's growing beauties with a &s;igh, and the tear was &s;ometimes ready to overflow the eyelid.</P>
<P>My dear father, &s;aid Fanny, may I a&s;k you the rea&s;on why you appear &s;o &s;ad? I have ob|&s;erved that for &s;ome time your looks have been fixed on me; and you &s;hed tears: Can I have given you, my tender parent, any rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied? will you no longer love your poor Fanny?&mdash;Child, ob&s;erve what I &s;ay, and an&s;wer me ingeniou&s;ly. Indeed, dear &s;ir, I have always &s;poke the truth to you.</P>
<P>Tell me, then, what are your &s;entiments of my lord? what do you think of him? &s;peak the truth. I think, father, &s;aid &s;he, with blu&s;hing
<PB N="147" REF="028632_0077_0FDA33A71E622320">
cheeks and down-ca&s;t eyes,&mdash;I think him very amiable; do you not think the &s;ame? My dear child, you mu&s;t learn to know men. This lord, whom you think &s;o amiable, would have brought me and your poor mother with &s;orrow to the grave; would have deprived me of all I hold mo&s;t dear&mdash;of my beloved Fanny!&mdash;Sir! what is it you &s;ay? He would, my dear child, (cla&s;p|ing her to his bo&s;om, and bathing her with his tears) he would have di&s;honoured me; would have taken you for the indulgence of a licenti|ous pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;for his mi&s;tre&s;s. (Upon this he &s;unk down into the arms of his daughter)&mdash;Heavens, what horrid wretches are men! who could have thought this of my lord? Take care, my dear Fanny, re&s;umed the father, take care of the &s;nare that may be laid for you. Receive no letters from my lord; never be a moment alone; be al|ways, if po&s;&s;ible, in the bo&s;om of your father and mother. Remember that the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is innocence. Embrace me, my dear child, and be the glory and comfort of your pa|rents.</P>
<P>Fanny wept. No, my worthy father, no, you never &s;hall have rea&s;on to blu&s;h for me. I did not apprehend any thing like this from my lord. What a barbarous man to di&s;turb our hap|pine&s;s! O that he may never come here! Grati|tude and re&s;pect, my child, are due to him; and
<PB N="148" REF="028632_0078_0FDA33ADA12E1460">
it will be your duty to ob&s;erve a profound &s;i|lence; only be directed by my advice.</P>
<P>Fanny, when alone, a thou&s;and times repeated, how can &s;o amiable a man have &s;uch ungenerous &s;entiments? O that vile London: how has it de|praved the heart of my lord Whatley! had he always lived here, certainly he would never have deba&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>His idea, neverthele&s;s, was &s;till with Fanny; and, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;he partook of the impre&s;&s;ion he had made. Her lover, in vain, had recour&s;e to the di&s;&s;ipation of his former amu&s;ements. He had received a wound which the art of London could not cure. Every plea&s;ure yielded to the remembrance of Fanny; &s;he was in every &s;cene, in every object.</P>
<P>Without waiting for the &s;pring, he re|turns into the country, accompanied by his friends, who all united to re&s;cue him from a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o degrading, as they called it, and con|temptible. What! &s;hould a Peer of England &s;igh under the influences of romantic love for a poor country girl! Ince&s;&s;antly &s;tunned with &s;uch reproaches as the&s;e, his vanity revolted again&s;t the attachment. Whatley, in the hour of gaity and intoxication, &s;ometimes promi&s;ed to think no more of Fanny; but the en&s;uing day renew|ed with a warmer intere&s;t, the idea of his &s;ove|reign
<PB N="149" REF="028632_0078_0FDA33ADA12E1460">
mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;o he called her. He ro&s;e more inflamed, and, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be pardoned, more infatuated with love.</P>
<P>Our noble lord, as may very well be &s;uppo&s;ed, was no &s;ooner arrived at his e&s;tate, than he went to the hou&s;e of his tenant. The timorous and re&s;pectful behaviour of love made him more ami|able. He could not get over that embarra&s;&s;ing confu&s;ion which the &s;ight of Adams always occa|&s;ioned. Fanny would fain have per&s;uaded her|&s;elf to look upon him with aver&s;ion, but he had acquired new charms.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he entered her father's hou&s;e, &s;he withdrew; but &s;he &s;tole a glance that ruined her repo&s;e, and made her repeat ince&s;&s;antly, he is extremely amiable. Whatley thought of a thou|&s;and pretences for paying his devotions to his hidden divinity,</P>
<P>One day he met Fanny at a little di&s;tance from the farm; &s;he appeared more beautiful, more engaging than ever he had &s;een her. A well-fancied hat on her head, the neighboring flow|ers that fell negligently by her &s;ide, her hair in a di&s;order preferable to all the elegance of art, her heaving bo&s;om, the tears that fell from her fine eyes upon, the ro&s;es of her cheeks; the&s;e were the circum&s;tances of that enchanting figure,
<PB N="150" REF="028632_0079_0FDA33AF5C658030">
in which he then &s;aw the mi&s;tre&s;s of his &s;oul. She was &s;eated at the foot of a tree, and it was ea&s;y to perceive that her young heart laboured under &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ive &s;entiment. Whatley threw him|&s;elf at her feet in tears. My &s;weet angel! &s;aid he. At the &s;ame moment, &s;he ro&s;e, and cried, my lord! He would have taken her hand; &s;he withdrew it ha&s;tily, would have forced her&s;elf from him, and fled to the farm. No, my divine creature, you will not leave me. What have I done, beautiful Fanny? What crime have I com|mitted? Ah, my lord, leave me, let me fly to my father; he has forbidden me to &s;peak to you, or to &s;ee you. It was very cruel, my lord, add|ed &s;he, with tears, to think of taking advantage of our poverty; you have given great di&s;turb|ance to my father, and all my relations. I have not de&s;erved &s;uch treatment from your lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>In pronouncing the la&s;t words, &s;he was advan|cing towards the farm-hou&s;e, and wept, letting fall her hand, which his lord&s;hip &s;eized a &s;econd time. Ah! divine Fanny! do not accu&s;e me, my friend alone &s;hould bear the blame: Never had I &s;uch an execrable thought; is it po&s;&s;ible that I, who love you to di&s;traction, &s;hould treat you without re&s;pect? He perceived Adams com|ing towards them, with a look of anger, inti|mating a de&s;ign to reprove his daughter.&mdash;Yes, my dear Adams, I will repeat it before you, and in the face of Heaven, that I adore your charm|ing
<PB N="151" REF="028632_0079_0FDA33AF5C658030">
daughter. She is virtue it&s;elf, dre&s;&s;ed by the graces, and it is my pride to lay at her feet, my&s;elf, my fortune, my honors, and my heart. (Fanny blu&s;hed; &s;he turned her fine eyes, that were full of tears, on her lover, thought him le&s;s criminal than her father had repre&s;ented him, and again ca&s;t tho&s;e eyes on the ground.) Yes, Adams, I declare it; Fanny has taught me that prejudice &s;hould yield to rea&s;on; and now that I am in your hou&s;e, before your wife and your children, I declare that I will marry her; that my name, my title, my fortune, and my whole &s;oul &s;hall be her's. Yes, my adorable Fanny, you &s;ee your lover and your hu&s;band at your feet.</P>
<P>What tran&s;port! what agitations in the heart of poor Fanny! What are you about, my lord? &s;aid Adams, rai&s;ing Whatley; it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to kneel before you. I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of your goodne&s;s, but ignorant and artle&s;s as we are, we know what is due to our&s;elves. My daughter was not born to the dignity of lady Whatley; that title belongs to ladies of equal rank with your&s;elf. Fanny, my lord, is your humble &s;ervant; &s;he has but one ma&s;ter that has a &s;uperior claim, and that is honor. No, my lord, I will never agree that you &s;hould marry beneath your&s;elf; I &s;hould be very unworthy of your favors, and tho&s;e of my lord, your father, who&s;e memory will be ever dear and &s;acred to me, if I &s;hould indulge that pa&s;&s;ion which now
<PB N="152" REF="028632_0080_0FDA33B061F98280">
blinds you; my wife, and Fanny her&s;elf, will be of the &s;ame opinion, and I have the honor, in their &s;tead, to point out to you what is your duty on this occa&s;ion, and what is ours. Fanny, once more looked on lord Whatley, and wept. Are not the&s;e, child, your &s;entiments? Yes, fa|ther, &s;aid &s;he. But that YES was pronounced with a trembling accent, her heart would have &s;natched up what her tongue had let fall.</P>
<P>What a triumph for Fanny! &s;he loved lord Whatley, and what &s;ecret tran&s;port mu&s;t &s;he have felt to find his pa&s;&s;ion &s;o great as to offer her mar|riage! Her lover did not let the thing re&s;t here. Every day he vi&s;ited Adams. The &s;ame per&s;e|verance of demanding Fanny in marriage on his part, the &s;ame fortitude of refu&s;al on the worthy father's. My lord at length determined to write to the mi&s;tre&s;s of his fate. He leaves a letter at the foot of a tree. He knew that Fanny mu&s;t pa&s;s this way, and depended on her curio&s;ity for taking up the paper, on which he wrote no &s;u|per&s;cription. Fanny comes to the tree beholds the billet, but in doubt whether &s;he &s;hould touch it. She proceeds without taking it up, looks back, returns to the place, yields to an involun|tary impul&s;e, unfolds the paper, and trembling, reads the following addre&s;s:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>You will ea&s;ily di&s;cover who is the writer of this letter, and to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed: It
<PB N="153" REF="028632_0080_0FDA33B061F98280">
proceeds from the mo&s;t tender, the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate of men; it is addre&s;&s;ed to the mo&s;t a|dorable, but the mo&s;t cruel, the mo&s;t barba|rous of women. Can the beautiful Fanny be ignorant, that the happine&s;s of Whatley de|pends &s;olely on her&s;elf and her re&s;pectable fa|ther? I can only give her my hand and my heart, the &s;acrifice is not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s my love. I know it well, my charming Fan|ny, but it is all that is in my power. If you loved me, if you had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of pity for your unhappy Whatley, I &s;hould be in hea|ven. The lover, the adorer of the divine Fan|ny would become her hu&s;band. But ah, cru|el! Have I a &s;igh that breathes not for you? And yet the&s;e &s;ighs mu&s;t &s;oon expire in death. Solicit your father to make me happy. Be|lieve that you will be the happie&s;t, the mo&s;t adored of women. Virtue and beauty level all di&s;tinctions. You have read Pamela: a woman like her, in virtues and accompli&s;h|ments, &s;hould, like her, be di&s;tingui&s;hed and rewarded. But ah, angelic creature! can it be an adequate recompence to you, to make you &s;overeign mi&s;tre&s;s of a man who has not the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed throne on earth to offer you.&mdash;Your an&s;wer will determine whether Whatley &s;hall end the mo&s;t wretched of be|ings, or live the mo&s;t happy of men.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="028632_0081_0FDA33B701A40B40">Ah, my lord, cried Fanny, why was I not nobly born? If I were a queen, you &s;hould have no wi&s;h ungratified.&mdash;Oh! he &s;uffers not what I endure.&mdash;Would we could change condi|tions! I would throw my&s;elf at the feet of my father and mother, and &s;hould &s;oon be his wife. Poor lord! How he loves me! No, no, he nev|er meant to di&s;honor me. I always thought it the contrivance of that wicked baronet.</P>
<P>Fanny kept the letter in her hand, peru&s;ed it an hundred times, and always with the mo&s;t ar|dent &s;en&s;ibility, with repeated exclamations of tender &s;orrow. She con&s;iders whether &s;he &s;hall &s;hew it to her father. She is afraid, by &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing it, of breaking her promi&s;e. She &s;ees him, runs towards him, and with tears that interrupt|ed her, &s;he cried, Take it, father, &s;ee here a letter from my lord which I &s;lave found. Poor lord!&mdash;he is very unhappy. If he &s;hould die.&mdash;</P>
<P>Adams read the letter. Fanny you never con|cealed any thing from me. Do you love my lord?&mdash;&s;he &s;obbed violently. My dear child, you have told me all; you are not in the hands of a &s;evere judge, inve&s;ted with parental autho|rity, but of a tender friend. What do you ex|pect from this unhappy pa&s;&s;ion? Your honor is dear to you. Oh, &s;ir! a thou&s;and times more than my life. Well, and could you ever flatter
<PB N="155" REF="028632_0081_0FDA33B701A40B40">
your&s;elf with being lady Whatley?&mdash;Would you have me take an advantage of a moment of weakne&s;s or illu&s;ion, to infringe every duty I owe to my ma&s;ters and benefactors? Are you a&s;hamed of your humble condition&mdash;of your fa|ther's poverty?</P>
<P>My father, &s;aid Fanny, with folded hands and floods of tears, Heaven is my witne&s;s, how much I love and honor you. If you love me, then, child, you will overcome that tenderne&s;s, which to you may be a &s;ource of mi&s;ery, and perhaps of endle&s;s &s;hame. We will part for &s;ome time. You &s;hall go to your aunt Harris, who lives about ten miles from hence; there you will remain con|cealed until my lord leaves this place, and re|turns to town, where he will forget you. Alas! would my lord forget me?&mdash;Go, my dear Fan|ny, you know not the great; you imagine that they are like us country people. I lived for &s;ome time in town, and I know that their friend|&s;hips are &s;hort lived. Marry a man of your own rank if you would be loved by your hu&s;band, and make your family happy. To-morrow you &s;hall go: I will tell your mother that your aunt has &s;ent for you, and I &s;hall pre-acquaint her with the affair. Go and prepare for your journey.</P>
<P>This was a thunder&s;troke to Fanny. Her fa|ther left her alone. It was then &s;he felt the

whole force, the whole influence of love. She &s;at down, or rather fell upon her chair, her head &s;upported by her hands, and her heart heaving as if it would bur&s;t. Shall I no more &s;ee my lord&mdash;be driven from him&mdash;&s;corn his ten|derne&s;s&mdash;refu&s;e to make him or my&s;elf happy&mdash; break my heart? How, how can I bear it! O my father! what is it you require of me! Can I have fortitude enough to obey you, to draw my|&s;elf into exile, into my grave? Yes, my aunt will receive my la&s;t &s;ighs. Ah, lord Whatley, lord Whatley!</P>
<P>Fanny pa&s;&s;ed a mi&s;erable night. Adams had &s;agacity to &s;ee into the heart of his daughter, and to perceive the cau&s;e of her agitation.&mdash; He loved her tenderly, and thought he &s;hould give her a proof of his affection, by obviating the effects of the young nobleman's pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash; The moment is fixed for the fatal departure.&mdash; No body about the farm knew whither Fanny was going, except only her mother, who par|took of her daughters di&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he beheld her labouring under tho&s;e afflictive &s;en&s;ations, which &s;he, in vain, endeavoured to conceal.</P>
<P>Fanny, in preparing for her journey, often &s;ighed. She met one of the young men belong|ing to the farm, who had a great regard for her; and &s;he was afraid every moment of being &s;ur|pri&s;ed by her father. Tell him, &s;aid &s;he, my
<PB N="157" REF="028632_0082_0FDA3343A5570560">
dear Williams, that I &s;hall never forget him, and that I am very unhappy. Pray, Mi&s;s, to whom &s;hall I carry this me&s;&s;age? Did I not tell you my friend? to my lord, who loves me, and would be glad to marry me, but my father is again&s;t it &mdash;A moment after&mdash;No, my friend, &s;aid &s;he, tell him nothing; I &s;hould offend my parents&mdash;I &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s my duty. Po&s;&s;ibly, one day, he will hear that I am dead, and then he will&mdash;</P>
<P>While this poor girl was torn by conflicting &s;en|timents, Adams appeared.&mdash;Come, child, take leave of your mother, your brother and &s;i&s;ters, and let us go. I will attend you my&s;elf, and do you take care to keep every thing a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>What did not poor Fanny feel at this moment? She quitted the &s;cenes where &s;he had &s;pent her happy childhood&mdash;the &s;cenes where &s;he had drawn her fir&s;t breath, and which received her la&s;t &s;ighs. She ca&s;t her tearful eyes on the &s;eat of Whatley; &s;he was a victim that was dragged to receive the mortal blow. At this in&s;tant a &s;ervant arrives from lord Whatley. Mr. Adams, &s;aid he, my lord de&s;ires to &s;peak with you this moment: He is in bed, very ill. Ill! cried Fan|ny&mdash;and her heart was then in new agitations.</P>
<P>Adams ha&s;ted to the &s;eat of his lord. He ac|tually found him in bed, and in a high fever.&mdash;
<PB N="158" REF="028632_0083_0FDA33BB4640BD10">
Whatley gave orders that he &s;hould be left alone with his tenant. Set down, my dear Adams, &s;aid he, with a feeble voice; you &s;ee the effects of your conduct. How, my lord?&mdash;Yes, Adams, you ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed me your Fanny; you will &s;oon be &s;et free from future &s;olicitation: I am &s;en&s;i|ble that what I &s;uffer from this di&s;appointment will bring me to the grave. Ah! my lord! replied the old man, you pierce me to the &s;oul! Can I be the occa&s;ion of your death, who would lay down my life for you a thou&s;and times?&mdash;This pa&s;&s;ion will go off. Your pre&s;ent infatuation will vani&s;h. No, Adams, no; I &s;hall never cea&s;e to adore your charming daughter; I &s;hall indemni|fy her for the injury fortune hath done her, by rai&s;ing her to the dignity of my own; and my intentions are fixed unle&s;s you are inclined to ha|&s;ten my pa&s;&s;age to the grave. Con&s;ider, my friend, whether you are really determined to murder the tendere&s;t of ma&s;ters. And with the&s;e words he held out his arms to embrace him.</P>
<P>The good old man, di&s;tracted with a thou&s;and different &s;en&s;ations, cried out, But, my lord, what will your family, the town, the whole world &s;ay?

You will be my fa|ther, continued he, embracing Adams, who was quite overpowered. Once more grant me my life, for it entirely depends on my union with Fanny. Come, my dear Adams, be not appre|hen&s;ive that my relations, or that the court &s;hould be offended. Let them but &s;ee, but know Fan|ny, and all will applaud my choice.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Adams was confounded: He &s;ighed: he ca&s;t his eyes on the ground. Whatley called his &s;ervants. They ri&s;e and dre&s;s him. He gets into the coach with Adams, and drives to the farm. He throws him&s;elf at the feet of Fanny, who had run to the gate, followed by her mo|ther. Yes, this, &s;aid he, is my adorable con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, the wife of my heart, and I will never have any other.</P>
<P>To Fanny every thing appeared like the illu&s;ion of a dream; when lord Whatley addre&s;&s;ed her with pre&s;&s;ing tenderne&s;s. Beautiful Fanny, it is your<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to confirm that con&s;ent, which mu&s;t be the joy of my life.</P>
<P>She &s;uffered him to take her hand, which he devoured with ki&s;&s;es. Whatley, at length, read his triumph in her ingenious a&s;pect. Fanny was &s;ilent; but her eyes &s;poke: Sometimes &s;he tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ed

them towards her father, as if &s;he would con|&s;ult him what an&s;wer &s;he was to make. The pa|rents of the worthy girl once more made the &s;tronge&s;t remon&s;trances; their pa&s;&s;ionate lord &s;till found means to &s;et them a&s;ide; until after many conflicts, denials, tears and intreaties, it was at length determined that his lord&s;hip &s;hould marry Fanny. He flies to his friends. Sir Thomas Ward had arrived &s;ome days before. My lord, af|ter &s;upper, when the &s;ervants were gone, and the gla&s;s went round, informs the company of his intention to marry Fanny. Sir Thomas receiv|ed the intelligence with indignation; and with a bur&s;t of &s;arca&s;tic laughter, he drank to the health of lord Whatley, the &s;on of farmer Adams.</P>
<P>The poor lord underwent the &s;evere&s;t raillery, the mo&s;t humiliating &s;arca&s;ms. He defended his intentions; he in&s;i&s;ted on the charms, the beau|ties, the virtues of the farmer's daughter: But the&s;e remon&s;trances were followed by more in|&s;ulting &s;allies of ridicule; and the arguments &s;till ended in the peer di&s;honored, di&s;graced by &s;uch an alliance. It would be needle&s;s to ob|&s;erve, that his lord&s;hip had great pride, and that this vice frequently triumphs over love and nature.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till he died, if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not Fanny. That was the an&s;wer to all the objections of his
<PB N="161" REF="028632_0084_0FDA33BC6CCDC1D0">
friends, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s her without marriage was impo&s;&s;ible. Should he employ any other means, he would break the hearts of a whole family that was dear to him: Fanny her&s;elf would look up|on him as a mon&s;ter, and her love, without her e&s;teem, would not gratify his heart. In &s;hort he could have no happine&s;s di&s;tinct from her's. Yet how was he to render this pa&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;tent with what he owed to the dignity of his birth, to the world and to his friends?</P>
<P>Sir Thomas, after declaiming profu&s;ely on impracticable projects, cried, This &s;cheme, gen|tlemen, you will certainly approve. But do you really, my dear Whatley, long to po&s;&s;e&s;s your little Fanny?&mdash;I had rather have the plea|&s;ure of looking upon her, than make a conque&s;t of all the beauties in London. And I tell you very &s;eriou&s;ly, that my life depends entirely up|on her. Well, my friend, then I expect your thanks for an expedient which will at once re|concile your honor, your plea&s;ure, and your rank; which will neither render you obnoxious to your uncle, to your own reflections, nor to the reproaches of the world. Depend upon me for the entire management of this affair. What is it you propo&s;e? &s;aid Whatley: Let me know your &s;cheme.&mdash;Do not you mean to marry Fanny? &mdash;Mo&s;t certainly.&mdash;Well, hear then, and admire my ingenuity when I would &s;erve my friends.
<PB N="162" REF="028632_0085_0FDA33C245F49CC8">
There is a clergyman in this neighborhood, who will oblige me in any thing; we &s;hall al&s;o be able to find managable witne&s;&s;es. In &s;hort, my friend, you &s;hall be married, and yea &s;hall not be married.</P>
<P>What! cried Whatley, be a traitor to Fanny! and he ro&s;e from his &s;eat with indignation. My dear lord, one moment's leave; pray be &s;eated. By this &s;uppo&s;ed marriage, you gratify your pa&s;|&s;ion without expo&s;ing your&s;elf to the ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment of your uncle. Your love will wear off with time, and when your enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;hall be over, you may indemnify Fanny for this little deception by a proper &s;ettlement. This will be a &s;ufficient price for the virtue of a country girl. Dete&s;table! Odious council! What! &s;hould I, under the &s;anction of &s;uch an infamous artifice, tear a child from the bo&s;om of her father! Be|tray my Fanny! added he, unable to re&s;train the ri&s;ing tears. How can you have the cruelty to propo&s;e it?&mdash;I will marry her in the face of hea|ven&mdash;in the face of the world. Let my marri|age continue a &s;ecret until the proper time, but let it be hone&s;tly executed, with the mo&s;t &s;a|cred oaths.</P>
<P>Without enlarging on the defence of Whatley, the attacks of his friends, and, above all, tho&s;e of the depraved baronet, who employed all his wit to draw this young lord into the mo&s;t attro|cious
<PB N="163" REF="028632_0085_0FDA33C245F49CC8">
of crimes, be it &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that their attempts were &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;The treacherous Ward was the principal agent in this horrid plot, and every thing was prepared for the pre|tended marriage. Whatley, &s;tung by remor&s;e, was frequently on the brink of defeating this in|fernal &s;cheme. But W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd, in&s;pired by his geni|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for villainy, as often overbore his intentions. Behold our young lord, then, in the bo&s;om of his beautiful, his innocent angel! Behold him in the raptures of tho&s;e pure, tho&s;e high-&s;et plea|&s;ures which alone &s;hould be the fruits of unvio|lated virtue, yet here they were the portion of guilt.</P>
<P>Whatley, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e charms, &s;unk under the influence of a heart-felt poi&s;on. It is true, that he con&s;tantly confirmed him&s;elf in the de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e nuptials, which fraud and impo&s;ture had pretended. Fanny had never left her father's hou&s;e; her hu&s;band was the idol of her &s;oul. She was that tender Eve, whom Milton has de&s;cribed, &s;o gently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the plea&s;ure of Adam. Yet there were moments when her heart was a prey to &s;adne&s;s, though the cau&s;e was unknown: Her parents too were pen|&s;ive, and felt the &s;ame unaccountable melancho|ly. But what were the pangs of Whatley, when his eyes were fixed on that adorable creature, &s;o touching, &s;o ingenuous, &s;o innocent in the very lap of plea&s;ure, and yet &s;o wronged! When
<PB N="164" REF="028632_0086_0FDA33C327F4CA50">
that angelic woman flew to meet him, with all the prodigality of cha&s;te embraces, con&s;cious of her injury, he would decline to meet her; would &s;ometimes &s;hed tears. His crime ro&s;e up again&s;t him. Perfidious Ward! he cried, perfidious Ward!</P>
<P>This uncle &s;ent for him to town. Fanny mu&s;t now be left, though now more than ever be|loved and adored. The Baronet did not per|mit him to go out of his &s;ight; he was afraid that his di&s;&s;imulation &s;hould abandon him, and accompained him when he took his leave. What|ley vowed inviolable love to Fanny, and promi&s;|ed &s;oon to return to her bo&s;om. The tender creature was with difficulty torn from the arms of her hu&s;band. It was in tho&s;e trying moments that Whatley felt all the vengeance of injured truth and honor. He beheld Fanny bathing his feet with her tears. No, cried he, interrupted by the agitations of his heart, no, excellent creature, I am not worthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s you; &s;uch charms, &s;uch virtues de&s;erved a better fate.</P>
<P>Ward at length carries him off, and &s;teals him from tho&s;e reflections that weighed down his heart, and were ready to e&s;cape from his lips. Fanny fainted away in the bo&s;om of her mother, when her eyes could no longer perceive her lord. He was now in the chai&s;e with the Baronet, who
<PB N="165" REF="028632_0086_0FDA33C327F4CA50">
exerted all his wicked art to &s;tifle that remor&s;e which per&s;ecuted and pur&s;ued him to London.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers and the learned deny the exi&s;tence of pre-&s;entiments, and treat them as chimeras and ab&s;urdities. I mu&s;t take the liberty, howe|ver, to differ from them, There is no man that hone&s;tly puts the que&s;tion to him&s;elf, but mu&s;t own that there have been &s;ome critical circum|&s;tances in his life, wherein he has been warned, as it were by an inward voice, that &s;eemed to foretel &s;ome approaching evil. This &s;ecret, and gloomy herald, came in all its horrors before the mind of Fanny; nor was the hour of repo&s;e ex|empt from the &s;ame inward alarm, The melan|choly reflections of the day were followed by hi|deous dreams in the night.</P>
<P>Whatley, arrived in town, is hurried by Sir Thomas round the circle of plea&s;ures. The ba&s;e Baronet knew the human heart, and wanted not to be told that foibles lead to crimes. He drew his freind into tho&s;e companies, where the delica|cy of &s;entiment is de&s;troyed, and every &s;ucceed|ing day he thought of Fanny with le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;ome feature of her image vani&s;hed from his mind.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas had communicated in confidence to lord Darnton, this adventure of his nephew; and it was in concert with this nobleman, that he
<PB N="166" REF="028632_0087_0FDA33C509B638A8">
endeavoured to draw Whatley into that round of di&s;&s;ipation, where the greater pa&s;&s;ions die away &mdash;for it is only with &s;olitude and reflection that they can live.</P>
<P>Whatley found le&s;s frequent opportunities to write to Fanny. He received her letters with le&s;s ardour. In one word, his love was abated. Not a day pa&s;&s;ed, but the fine&s;t girls in town, like &s;o many Circes, &s;ought by their embraces to rob him of his tenderne&s;s and his virtue.</P>
<P>Fanny's greate&s;t misfortune was the youth of Whatley: Who at his years, has the fortitude to call his heart to an account, or to rouze it from that un&s;entimental &s;tate to which it has been re|duced by di&s;&s;ipation? True plea&s;ures are never enjoyed but by maturer years. Upon our fir&s;t en|trance into life, we are generally under &s;uch an intoxication, as is no le&s;s de&s;tructive to plea&s;ure than to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Ward, among the re&s;t of his &s;eductive arts, did not fail to cheri&s;h and encourage the vanity of his noble friend. By this he undoubtedly medi|ated a more mortal blow to the intere&s;t of poor Fanny, than any &s;he could &s;uffer from the influ|ence of rival beauty. When he thought him&s;elf tolerably &s;ure of the &s;ucce&s;s of his artifices, he acquainted lord Darnton with the di&s;po&s;ition to which he had brought his nephew.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="028632_0087_0FDA33C509B638A8">Whatley had beheld, with &s;ome emotion, the growing beauties of Mi&s;s Barry, the daughter of lord Raven&s;tone. This impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o favourable to the de&s;igns of lord Darnton, was immediately communicated to him. He concerted with the father of that lady, the proper means of drawing Whatley into an attachment. The hou&s;e of lord Raven&s;tone was open to him; was the young la|dy, at every vi&s;it, appeared more charming. Sir Thomas, like Milton's devil, employed every artifice, and every temptation. He added new force to Mi&s;s Barry's attractions. He &s;poke par|ticularly of her high birth, and of the dignity it would confer on the per&s;on who &s;hould have the good fortune to marry her. In &s;hort, lord Darnton, acquainted with the progre&s;s of his &s;cheme, propo&s;es to his nephew to marry lord Raven&s;tone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s daughter. Everything, added he, is already &s;ettled: You are beloved by the lady, and nothing is wanting but your con&s;ent. I flat|ter my&s;elf that you will not di&s;avow my proceed|ings. She is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant matches in England. Whatley changes countenance throws him&s;elf at the feet of his un|cle declares with tears his &s;ituation; his engage|ments to Fanny, and the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of confirming them by a lawful marriage. Lord Darnton embraces and care&s;&s;es his nephew, an|&s;wers him with a di&s;&s;embled kindne&s;s, and em|ploys every art to dazzel and overcome his inte|grity; but he remains inflexible. Rage and

In &s;hort, after many tumults, ma|ny conflicts Fanny is &s;acrificed, and the weak, the guilty Whatley marries Mi&s;s Barry. Were it allowable to paint the horrid crime in le&s;s hi|deous colours, one might &s;ay that he was in &s;ome mea&s;ure, dragged to the alter; that, even in the arms of his new bride, he bewailed the wife of his heart&mdash;the wife whom heaven had de&s;tined and devoted to him; and that the image of Fanny was ever in his mind. The cruel lord Darnton took upon him to convey the fatal news to the daughter of Adams. He had promi&s;ed his ne|phew to &s;ettle &s;uch an income on her, as &s;hould be, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, a &s;ufficient con&s;o|lation for her di&s;appointment.&mdash;The crafty uncle, however, was not &s;atisfied with this triumph. He was &s;till afraid, that Fanny would recover her former influence; and therefore got Whatley nominated to one of the remote&s;t foreign courts. Our young lord &s;et off with his new-married lady, accompanied by Sir Thomas Ward, who never left him a moment to his own reflections, and who was always flattering him on his dignities and di&s;tinctions; the poor recompence of forfeit|ed innocence and faithful love.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="028632_0088_0FDA33CA36696D98">The anxieties, the painful pen&s;ivene&s;s of Fan|ny encrea&s;ed. Already &s;ome weeks were pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he had heard from Whatley. She could no longer re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t cruel &s;u&s;picions. In vain was &s;he comforted by her father and the re&s;t of the family. How could &s;he avoid being a|larmed at the &s;ilence of the man &s;he adored?

A &s;ervant, who had more humanity than his ma&s;ter, was moved with com|pa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate man; he took him by the arm, and endeavoured to recover him. Adams opened his eyes, and with a bitter excla|mation, threw him&s;elf again on the floor, cry|ing, They have deceived my daughter&mdash;&s;he is not married. O my God! my God!&mdash;He ro&s;e ha&s;ti|ly, and was going to &s;eek lord Darnton, but his &s;trength failed him; he was obliged to &s;et down, and could do nothing but vent his angui&s;h in a torrent of tears. The compa&s;&s;ionate dome&s;tic endeavoured to comfort him; he exhorted him to be reconciled to his misfortunes&mdash;repre&s;ented the quality and power of lord Darnton, and con|cluded, with relating to him all the circum&s;tan|ces

of Whatley's pretended marriage with Fanny, Adams in di&s;traction, tore his hair, and talked of &s;tabbing lord Darnton. The &s;teward brought him two thou&s;and pounds ready told. Adams da&s;hed them from him with all the rage of ho|ne&s;t indignation.&mdash;Wretch let your ma&s;ter keep his infamous wealth!

<P>The &s;ituation of Adams is not to be de&s;cribed: His general exclamations were, My poor daugh|ter! Child of my heart!

<P>Lord Whatley, though married to a charming woman, in the bo&s;om of plea&s;ures and honors, and &s;urrounded with the pomp of dignity, was far from ta&s;ting any true happine&s;s. His lady had all the airs of a woman of quality; behav|ing with a digu&s;ting coldne&s;s to her hu&s;band, and countenancing the attention of others, in the genuine &s;pirit of coquetry&mdash;&s;he was hand&s;ome, vain, and haughty: Yet that haughtine&s;s was not &s;o &s;evere, as to &s;werve her from many &s;candalous adventures, the report of which came to the ears of her Lord. He would have urged his affection, but was not heard: He threatened her with the authority of an injured hu&s;band, but his threats were an&s;wered by the mo&s;t glaring indecorums. The daughter of Lord Raven&s;tone was &s;upported by a great name, and a powerful intere&s;t at court. Whatley was therefore obliged to put up with his affronts&mdash;The conduct of his lady, ma|ny times brought to his remembrance, his poor Fanny, who loved, who adored him, and whom he had di&s;honored at the expence of the pure&s;t

and tendere&s;t love. But this image that aro&s;e in his mind was &s;oon de&s;troyed by the indu&s;try of the baronet. He hurried him round a circle of continual di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;He plunged him into eve|ry debauchery of heart and mind, and while he was repelling the remembrance of Fanny, he was extingui&s;hing, by the &s;ame means, the natural &s;en|timents of honor and virtue.</P>
<P>Some years pa&s;&s;ed, while Whatley continued in his death of rea&s;on, and hone&s;t &s;en&s;ibility. He returned to London with his wife, who did not fail to torment him with the mo&s;t cruel chagrins. She di&s;honored him by her continual intrigues, embroiled him with her relations, and rendered him contemptible in the eyes of the court. Yet in the&s;e mortifying circum&s;tances, he had one con&s;olation. His lady died, leaving him debts, enemies, in&s;ult and &s;hame. It was then that Whatley gave him&s;elf up to the mo&s;t boundle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation: There was not a noted ta|vern in London where he was not the di&s;tingui&s;h|ed hero of libertini&s;m, and Sir Thomas Ward partook of his reputation.

He had retired from &s;er|vice, and lived like a true philo&s;opher; that is, like a man who had the &s;upport of honor and virtue at heart. He employed the greate&s;t part of his fortune in the relief of indigence: He a|voided &s;plendor, and lived under the productive and plea&s;ing &s;hade of his own integrity. His name was Windham. Whatley flew to his apart|ment; whom he no &s;ooner perceived, than he cried, Ah! my Lord, I &s;hall &s;oon follow my un|happy victim to the grave. I cannot bear to think of this event; to think that I have depriv|ed a man of his life! I ought to have evaded a circum&s;tance &s;o horrible. Fatal prejudice! How long &s;hall it triumph over rea&s;on! Is it thus a a man &s;erves his country?&mdash;How nearly doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch virtue border on a crime!</P>
<P>This worthy man was pierced with grief and melancholy; neverthele&s;s, he recovers the health that he apprehended he &s;hould no longer enjoy. Whatley, while he bewailed the fate of his friend, was obliged to own that he alone had been to blame, and that he had obliged Wind|ham
<PB N="191" REF="028632_0099_0FDA33E3711EAD30">
to come to extremities. He was no le&s;s rea|dy to acknowledge that the Baronet had been the cau&s;e of all his irregularities; that he had led him into that &s;hameful treachery, the di&s;grace of his life: In one word that he had been the oc|ca&s;ion of all Fanny's &s;ufferings. The&s;e reflexions rendered the memory of Sir Thomas le&s;s dear to his friend.</P>
<P>Windham informed his lord&s;hip of the cruel behavior of Lord Darnton, with regard to the unfortunate Adams. What a de&s;cription for Whatley! His &s;oul had recovered all its hone&s;ty, all its &s;en&s;ibility. Windham was a kind of &s;upe|rior being, who re&s;cued him from that gulph of depravity into which Ward had plunged him; and Whatley wi&s;hed for nothing but the moment that &s;hould re&s;tore him to his Fanny, the only wife of his heart.</P>
<P>Windham related &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;till heightened his impatience to &s;ee her. That worthy man, in travelling over the different counties of England, had been led by accident to the hou&s;e of that clergyman with whom Fanny and her family had taken refuge. It was from them he learnt their misfortunes, and the perfid|ious behavior of Lord Whatley. Windham, with plea&s;ure indulged his impatience; and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook their way to the village where the clergy|man lived.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="028632_0100_0FDA33EA255E19E0">Whatley already felt the happine&s;s of repair|ing his injuries, and at length they arrived: But what a thunder-&s;troke to the penitent Lord! They found the clergyman dead; and the place where Adams and his family had retired was un|known. It was only ob&s;erved, that wherever their were, they mu&s;t be very mi&s;erable.&mdash;This, cried Lord Whatley, is what I have done. I am the cau&s;e why the&s;e unfortunate people, perhaps, are now no more. It is I who have murdered the mo&s;t adorable of woman. Let us go no far|ther, my generous friend! Here I will die: Here, where my Fanny has wept and reproach|ed me. No, angelic creature! you never could love me after &s;uch enormities; my conduct is de|te&s;table even in my own eyes. Let us go, my Lord, &s;aid Windham, let us not idly give up our &s;earches here. Why &s;hould we di&s;tru&s;t the goodne&s;s of heaven? It is that which has opened your eyes. Let us believe that we are under the conduct of Providence, and that your Fanny will be re&s;tored to your arms, that you you may make re&s;titution for all the injuries you have done to her and her relations. Virtue has its rewards &s;ometimes even in this world. Thus he encouraged the de&s;pairing Whatley: They pur|&s;ued their journey, and made the mo&s;t dilligent enquiries.</P>
<P>Windham him&s;elf at length begun to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, and the unhappy Lord was in the
<PB N="193" REF="028632_0100_0FDA33EA255E19E0">
greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. They were on hor&s;e-back, and unattended, when they met a Baronet of Wind|ham's acquaintance; he &s;topped a little to talk with him, and Whatley rode forward.</P>
<P>A child was weeping very bitterly at a little di&s;tance from the road. The poor innocent ap|peared to be about &s;ix or &s;even years of age. It had an air of delicacy which was touching, un|der the di&s;advantages of a poor dre&s;s. Its tears, its native comeline&s;s, greatly moved his lord&s;hip. He looked upon the child with pity, and could not draw his eyes from it. What makes you weep, my little dear, &s;aid he? My poor mam|ma! &s;he told me &s;he &s;hould die &s;oon, and &s;he wept when &s;he ki&s;&s;ed me.&mdash;Mamma is very un|happy&mdash;We have nothing to live upon&mdash;Mam|ma cries, and grand-papa is &s;ick in bed. Thus the child, with mingled tears and &s;ighs, uttered its little complaints. Poor child! but your fa|ther, my dear&mdash;Oh! Sir, I never &s;aw my papa: It is my papa that makes us all unhappy: Mam|ma often talks of him: She &s;ays &s;he loves him, and &s;hall love him as long as he lives: Though to be &s;ure he has given us a great deal of trou|ble. She makes me pray to God for him every day. Poor papa is in a very bad way, added the child, weeping as if its little heart would break.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="028632_0101_0FDA33EEB2B5D790">Lord Whatley was affected, and alighting from his hor&s;e, run towards the child, who did not &s;eek to &s;hun him, but &s;tretched out its arms to embrace him. Embrace, my little angel! you are a &s;weet child&mdash;And what are your parents? They work the field&mdash;Your mother too?&mdash;She is always the fir&s;t that goes to work, Sir, though &s;he has not much &s;trength&mdash;She takes care of my grand-papa&mdash;I wi&s;h I were rich that I could help my poor mamma, &s;he is &s;o very good&mdash;And where do you live, my dear child?&mdash;Below there, Sir! Shewing him a wretched cottage. Will you go with me to your dear mamma? Oh! &s;he would chide me, Sir! My mamma &s;ees nobody. Fear not, &s;aid his lord&s;hip, &s;till embracing the child, I will make your excu&s;e. The child he|&s;itated, looked at him, and gave him its hand&mdash; He took it into one of his, and with the other held his hor&s;e's bridle. Windham followed him at a di&s;tance. He went along with the child, who conducted him to a poor hut covered with thatch, and &s;urrounded by a mi&s;erable hedge. A few paces from the cottage he &s;aw a woman &s;itting upon the &s;ide of a ditch, with a matlock in her hand, and &s;eemingly oppre&s;&s;ed with fa|tigue and melancholy. The child goes up to her: Pray, mamma, do not chide me for bring|ing this gentleman, who wanted to &s;ee you. She looked up. Whatley fell at her feet: My dear Fanny. My Lord Whatley! She fainted away. Her child threw it&s;elf into her arms.
<PB N="195" REF="028632_0101_0FDA33EEB2B5D790">
And at the &s;ame moment Windham came up. Whatley fir&s;t recovered. My dear Fanny! Is it you! O my friend! I have found the mi&s;tre&s;s of my heart. My excellent, my only love, &s;ee me at your feet! Lift up your eyes! Behold your lover! your hu&s;band&mdash;who repents from his &s;oul! My dear Fanny to what a condition have I reduced you!</P>
<P>Whatley was pro&s;trate at her feet, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips and bathed with his tears. Fanny recovers from her &s;woon, and falling into his bo&s;om, is it you, &s;aid &s;he, my Lord Whatley?&mdash;Yes, my adorable love, it is your hu&s;band, who, repenting of all his follies and vices, returns to virtue and your embraces, and to that tenderne&s;s which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his &s;oul, and makes him die to repair your injuries! &mdash;My Lord! have you embraced your child, &s;aid Fanny, tenderly&mdash;Go, my dear, and embraces your father&mdash;My child! O God! My child!&mdash; This perfectly overcome him&mdash;He carre&s;&s;ed Fan|ny and her child by turns, and pre&s;&s;ed them to his bo&s;om. Yes, my Lord, continued Fanny, it is your child&mdash;the fruit of our unhappy love&mdash;I have brought him up to love you, that when he &s;urvived me, he might tell you of his unfortu|nate mother; for had you come a few days later, you would not have &s;een me here&mdash;I &s;hould have left a letter in his hands, and might have flatter|ed my&s;elf&mdash;Her &s;welling bo&s;om would not give
<PB N="196" REF="028632_0102_0FDA33F027DC8760">
her utterence, and Whatley took her again into his arms&mdash;Ah! tell me not of my crimes! I am &s;everely puni&s;hed for them&mdash;I feel it at my &s;oul &mdash;But oh! could I then reduce to &s;uch a condi|tion, the mo&s;t valuable of women? My deare&s;t life&mdash;May I, by every in&s;tance of love and ten|derne&s;s, prevail on you to forget my barbarity, my treachery&mdash;My unde&s;erved treachery?&mdash;Then he &s;poke, and wept upon her hand as he pre&s;&s;ed it to his mouth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to excu&s;e my&s;elf by telling you that Ward led me into this &s;cene of villainy. I would appear to you a criminal, as I really am, that I may owe every thing to your genero&s;ity and your tenderne&s;s. Forgive me, forgive the man who &s;hall e&s;teem it an honor to bear the name of your hu&s;band, and that of a father to this amiable child (pre&s;&s;ing it again to his heart) &mdash;But where is your father?&mdash;My father?&mdash;May I &s;ee him?&mdash;He is in bed, an&s;wered Fanny, ex|piring with &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow; for &s;orrow has preyed upon him more than want&mdash;Want! &s;aid Whatley, O God&mdash;My heart will break. Ah! worthy Windham! What a wretch have I been &mdash;Yes, my poor Fanny, it is I who have redu|ced you to the&s;e extremities&mdash;And&mdash;What is that I &s;ee?&mdash;The bread we live upon&mdash;The bread that is earned by our toil, and &s;teeped in our tears&mdash;It was a coar&s;e brown loaf. Whatley could &s;carcely &s;upport him&s;elf at the &s;ight&mdash;He
<PB N="197" REF="028632_0102_0FDA33F027DC8760">
rai&s;ed his hands to heaven, and in broken ac|cents cried, What, my dear, my virtuous crea|ture, was this your food&mdash;While I&mdash;O, my God! My God!&mdash;I &s;hall die&mdash;I cannot &s;urvive the&s;e horrid thoughts&mdash;Ah, my Lord! What charms in this repentance for your Fanny!

<P>Fanny de&s;ired him to wait until &s;he had ac|quainted him with his arrival. She feared that the &s;udden &s;ight of her Lord might be fatal to the langui&s;hing old man. She did not know how to te&s;tify her gratitude to Windham. Lord Whatley had told her, in a few words, all that the worthy man had done to bring him back to a &s;en&s;e of truth and honor. Fanny flew to her father&mdash;My dear father, &s;aid &s;he, take comfort&mdash; I have good news to tell you&mdash;My Lord What|ley is come&mdash;He acknowledges his faults&mdash;And will he own you for his wife? Shall I have that con&s;olation before I die?&mdash;Yes, worthy Adams, cried his Lord&s;hip, running to embrace the old

man, you &s;ee your daughter's hu&s;band, your &s;on who comes to bewail his faults in your bo&s;om, and would give his life to repair them. Adams, overcome with &s;urprize and joy, could only ut|ter&mdash;Ah, my Lord!&mdash;The tears flowed from his eyes; he would have got up, and attempted at &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect&mdash;Lie &s;till my father, &s;aid Whatley, it is my duty to do you honour and re&s;pect:&mdash;I have injured you; I have be|trayed my faith, and virtue, and Fanny&mdash;I am ready to make &s;atisfaction for every thing&mdash;I humbly a&s;k pardon of you, of your dear daugh|ter, of humanity it&s;elf, which I have wounded, through the heart of the worthy Adams. Yes, you &s;hall be my father, and your daughter &s;hall be my wife, the only mi&s;tre&s;s of my &s;oul. He then enquired of Fanny concerning her mother&mdash; Alas! replied the old man, &s;he is no more!&mdash; She adored her daughter. Ah! I under&s;tand you&mdash;This is my doing&mdash;Wretched and guilty Whatley, how &s;halt thou expiate thy crimes?&mdash; Ah, my father! Ah, my Fanny!</P>
<P>Situations like the&s;e, admit of no adequate de&s;cription; but the heart may feel, and the mind may conceive what the pen can never paint.</P>
<P>Our poor cottagers went to dinner: How did their extreme indigence then pierce the &s;oul of Whatley! Scarce had they a &s;ufficiency of that
<PB N="199" REF="028632_0103_0FD9BB443209B528">
coar&s;e bread, the very &s;ight of which, &s;truck him with horror&mdash;The dying Adams was another ob|ject that might have &s;mitten the heart of barba|rity it&s;elf&mdash;Every thing that appeared in this man&s;ion of mi&s;ery was a dagger in the brea&s;t of this penitent Lord. But when his looks were fixed on that woman whom he adored; when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead in her pale countenance the cruel impre&s;|&s;ions of pain and poverty, and &s;aw tho&s;e arms that were locked in his with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, faded and emaciated, he was torn with that re|mor&s;e, tho&s;e torments of the &s;oul, which are ten thou&s;and times more acute than any external tor|ture. Every in&s;tant he cried, with tears that bled from the heart&mdash;My virtuous Fanny! To what mi&s;ery have I reduced you!&mdash;And is it po&s;|&s;ible that you can &s;till love me?&mdash;Fanny, em|bracing him, an&s;wered, Yes, my Lord!&mdash;You were always dear to me; and you &s;hould have pierced me to the heart, if you would have per|mitted me to ki&s;s your hand.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;cene in this world that can at|tract the eye of the Supreme Being, it is, un|doubtedly, that of &s;incere repentance, of pure and hone&s;t love, the triumph of &s;entiment and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Lord Whatley learned that Fanny's two &s;i&s;ters had not long &s;urvived their mother: That her brothers, obliged by their misfortunes to leave
<PB N="200" REF="028632_0104_0FDA33FC2596B9F8">
their fathers hou&s;e, were in the &s;ervice of far|mers; that &s;he and her father, after the death of the clergyman, their relation, being reduced to extreme indigence, tilled, with their own hands a piece of ground, where they had built a kind of &s;hed to live in, and that this had been &s;carce|ly &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of their mi&s;erable lives. Fanny loved her Lord too much to af|flict him with a detail of &s;uch circum&s;tances: He learnt them from Windham.</P>
<P>Whatley removed Adams to his own &s;eat, where the old man &s;oon recovered his health. A very elegant apartment was prepared for Fanny, who, a few days after their arrival, dre&s;&s;ed in a magnificent &s;uit, was married to her Lord. It is needle&s;s to add, that Windham was one of the principal a&s;&s;i&s;tants on this fe&s;tive occa&s;ion. Lord Whatley agreeably &s;urprized Adams, by pre|&s;enting to him his two &s;ons, dre&s;&s;ed in a manner becoming their change of fortune. I was willing, my dear father, &s;aid he, to make all our family happy. The brothers of Fanny ought to be mine, and it is my intention that they &s;hall par|take of my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the evening, when Whatley had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attendants, he threw him&s;elf at the feet of lady W&mdash;, and, at la&s;t, &s;aid he, my excellent Fanny, you will embrace an hu&s;band, who&s;e on|ly &s;tudy will be to make you forget your &s;uffer|ings.
<PB N="201" REF="028632_0104_0FDA33FC2596B9F8">
Will you pardon me all the injuries, all the wrongs I have done you! My dear, my ado|rable wife! your misfortunes have not robbed you of your beauty; it will bloom afre&s;h when cheri&s;hed by my ki&s;&s;es, and watered by my tears, I &s;ee the effect of my own conduct, and you are more dear to me: You have been my victim, you &s;hall be my &s;overeign, be all that is dear to me, with the lovely child that pleads for its father's pardon. Let it not plead in vain, my dear Fan|ny! She could only an&s;wer with tears of plea|&s;ure, the &s;trong, though inarticulate expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, and overpowered by the intoxicating tenderne&s;s, &s;he &s;unk into his arms. O charm inexpre&s;&s;ible of pure and tender attachments! Plea&s;ures of love! What are you without tho&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>Windham was about to take leave of Whatley. What! Sir, &s;aid his lord&s;hip, will you refu&s;e to reap the fruits of your labor? And what &s;cenes can you find more intere&s;ting than the&s;e? You have united two hearts, my dear friend, that know how to be grateful for the favors you have done them. Enjoy the plea&s;ure of beholding the effects of your kindne&s;s. You have re&s;tored me to virtue, to Fanny, and to happine&s;s; but can that happine&s;s be perfect, if you add not the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip to tho&s;e of love! Wind|ham
<PB N="202" REF="028632_0105_0FDA3404CCA72A90">
embraced his friend with tho&s;e tears that &s;pring from the heart. Well, my dear children, I accept your offer: It will be &s;ome con&s;olation to my old age to find that there are yet on earth, &s;en&s;ible and virtuous &s;ouls. They removed to London, where Fanny proved her&s;elf the mo&s;t charming and amiable of women. She was a model for tho&s;e who had long &s;hone in the circle of di&s;tingui&s;hed life, and &s;hewed by her beauty and her deportment, that the virtues and the graces are the natives of villages, rather than of cities. She went yearly to vi&s;it that poor cot|tage where Whatley and Windham had found her. There &s;he &s;eemed to find her virtues &s;trengthened, her principles improved. Scenes of poverty call us back to that mode&s;ty, and that &s;ubdued frame of mind, which are the be&s;t &s;upport of virtue.</P>
<P>Whatley de&s;pi&s;ed, do&s;honoured, chagrined by his marriage with Lord Raven&s;tone's daughter, was indebted, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for a &s;econd ex|i&s;tence to the daughter of the farmer. Led by the tender influences of cha&s;te love, he returned to the duties of a man, a citizen, and a &s;ubject: He entered once more into the &s;ervice he had quitted, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, and obtained the mo&s;t honourable appointments. Lord Darnton him&s;elf made a kind of public &s;atisfaction to
<PB REF="028632_0105_0FDA3404CCA72A90">
Adams and Fanny; he declared Whatley his heir, and died in the arms of his niece. Hea|ven, as a recompence to Adams, prolonged his life to an advanced and happy old age; and Fanny had &s;everal children, the delight and or|nament of their family and their country.</P>
