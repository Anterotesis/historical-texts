<Q>Is there not &s;ome hidden cur&s;e in the &s;tores of Heaven, red with uncommon wrath, to bla&s;t the man who owes his greatne&s;s to his country's ruin.</Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Right Honorable LORD NORTH, Fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, Chancellor of the Ex|chequer, and Ranger of Bu&s;hy Park, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE know not which is mo&s;t to be dete&s;ted, your Lord&s;hip's pu&s;illanimity, or your villany, &s;uch a mi&s;creant never before di&s;graced the admini&s;tration of any country, nor the confidence of any King; one day you are all fire and &s;word, Bo&s;ton is to be laid in a&s;hes, and the rivers of America are to run with the blood of her inhabitants; &s;hips are prepared, troops embarked, and officers appointed for the threatened carnage; you no &s;ooner find the brave Americans are deter|mined to re&s;i&s;t your in&s;truments of &s;laughter, and to oppo&s;e the cruel de&s;igns of a de&s;potic tyrant, to rob them of their rights, than all the bravadoing and all the blu&s;tering of your Lord&s;hip, is imme|diately &s;oftened into a calm, and you relax; fear
<PB N="42" REF="013945_0002_0F925D1FC1BD05C8">&s;eizes your da&s;tardly &s;oul, and you &s;ink beneath the weight of accumulated guilt.</P>
<P>One day we hear of nothing but accu&s;ations, pro&s;criptions, impeachments, and bills of attainder again&s;t the patriots in America, and they are &s;peedily to be apprehended, and to receive a puni&s;hment due to their crimes, due to rebels; three days do not clap&s;e before this ju&s;t and noble re&s;olution of your Lord&s;hip to bring tho&s;e traitors to a trial is dropped, and lenient or no &s;teps are to be taken again&s;t them. Another day all the colonies are in a &s;tate of rebel|lion, and the la&s;t advices received from America, you tell the Hou&s;e of Commons, were of a very alarming nature, and &s;uch a daring &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;|tance had manife&s;ted it&s;elf throughout the conti|nent, that it was now high time Parliament &s;hould adopt mea&s;ures for enforcing obedience to the late acts, a plan is no &s;ooner propo&s;ed by you, but car|ried by a rotten majority, for reducing them to a &s;tate of &s;ubjection to your, and your royal ma&s;ter's will; and blood&s;hed and &s;laughter &s;tare them in the face; they laugh at your impotent malice, and with a &s;pirited firmne&s;s, becoming of freemen, dare you to the &s;troke; when behold, your threats, and the re&s;olutions of your venal troop (I will not call it a Briti&s;h &s;enate) become like the threats and re|&s;olutions of a &s;ociety of coal-porters, who declare vengeance again&s;t another body of men, who will not comply with their unlawful impo&s;itions, but fear the next day, without even the &s;hadow of ju&s;tice on their &s;ide, to carry their de&s;perate de&s;ign into execution. The motion you made, my Lord, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, on Monday la&s;t, for a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the &s;everal American acts, till it is known which of the provinces will rai&s;e a revenue, and contribute to the luxuries of the parent &s;tate, &s;ub|ject
<PB N="43" REF="013945_0003_0F925D204604BDB0">to the controul of the Briti&s;h Parliament, is a &s;ubterfuge too low, and too thinly di&s;gui&s;ed to de|ceive the Americans, or to impo&s;e upon the under|&s;tanding of the meane&s;t capacity; it is evident to the world this is only a villanous plan to divide them, who, while united together, may bid defi|ance to all your Lord&s;hip's cunning, fraud, force, and villany. The Americans, my Lord, are too &s;en&s;ible, and too brave to be drawn into any trap, either of your, or your royal ma&s;ter's making; you may weave the web as artfully as you plea&s;e for their de&s;truction, and they will be &s;ure to break it; their cau&s;e is ju&s;t, 'tis the cau&s;e of heaven, and built upon the &s;olid foundation of truth and li|berty; they will carefully watch over the &s;acred gifts of God, and never &s;urrender them to you, nor any power upon earth, but with their lives. You have found, my Lord, that your ho&s;tile inva|&s;ion, and all your force and violence would not terrify them into a compliance with your mea&s;ures, nor an&s;wer the infamous de&s;ign of making the King ab&s;olute in America; and now you are determined to try, whether by fraud and artifice you can ef|fect your purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You have, my Lord, by the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;|&s;ions drove the Americans to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, you have de&s;troyed their charters, invaded their rights, impo&s;ed taxes contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice, and to every idea of repre&s;entation, and by blockading the port of Bo&s;ton, reduced near thirty thou&s;and people, in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, to a &s;tate of dependence upon the charity and benevolence of their fellow &s;ubjects; and now, rare conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, of the &s;everal American acts, or in other words mini&s;terial oppre&s;&s;ion and villany is to be granted them, provided they will rai&s;e a revenue in
<PB N="44" REF="013945_0004_0F925D23C0541B40">America, &s;till &s;ubject to the controul of the king and Parliament in England: This &s;u&s;pen&s;ion &s;cheme, my Lord, will not do, the Americans will have a repeal of all the acts they complain of, and a full re&s;toration of all their charters, rights, li|berties, and privileges, before they grant you a &s;ingle farthing, and then not &s;ubject to the con|troul of a banditti of rotten members in St. Ste|phen's chapel, of your appointing, for where would be the difference between their taxing them&s;elves, &s;ubject to the controul, and at the di&s;po&s;al of the King and Parliament here, or of the Hou&s;e of Commons in England taxing them in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, there would be none, my Lord, and they would &s;till be in the &s;ame &s;ituation they are now; &s;till &s;ubject to the will of the King, and the corrupt influence of the crown; this &s;cheme, my Lord, ap|pears to me as ridiculous and ab&s;urd, as the nega|tive &s;till ve&s;ted in the court of Aldermen of the city of London, which gives a power to a majority of twenty-&s;ix to &s;et a&s;ide the choice of &s;even thou|&s;and Liverymen, in the election of their Mayors. Be a&s;&s;ured, my Lord, this new plan mu&s;t fall to the ground, with all your former ones in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s; the day of trial is at hand, the Americans will be firm, they will have a confirmation of all their rights; they will have a redre&s;s of all their grievances; they will levy their own taxes, not &s;ub|ject to any controuling power; and they will fix the con&s;titutional liberties of America, upon a foundation not be again &s;haken by you, nor any pu&s;illanimous, weak, wicked, or cruel tyrant.</P>
<P>It is unnatural; but for a moment, my Lord, &s;uppo&s;e the Americans &s;hould come into your pro|po&s;als, or agree with the terms of your motion; how, my Lord, can you make reparation for the
<PB N="45" REF="013945_0005_0F925D24D5459268">injuries England and America have &s;u&s;tained, or will it in any degree le&s;&s;en your villany, or atone for your crimes; what compen&s;ation can you make for the lo&s;s of our trade, to the amount of near three millions? What compen&s;ation can you make for robbing the nation of near one million and a half of money, to carry on your execrable de&s;igns again&s;t your fellow &s;ubjects in America? You can make none: Your head indeed would be a plea&s;ing &s;pectacle upon Temple-Bar, but the lo&s;s of that, and your e&s;tates, would never atone for a ten thou&s;andth part of your crimes and villany, &s;till it is to be hoped the minority in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the people will never leave you, till they have both made you a public example, and brought you to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Every mea&s;ure, my Lord, of your admini&s;tration at home has been cruel, arbitrary, and uncon&s;ti|tutional; and every mea&s;ure, with re&s;pect to foreign affairs, has been weak, cowardly, ab&s;urd and re|diculous; unbecoming an Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, and only calculated to de&s;troy the honor and intete&s;t of this kingdom.</P>
<P>The glory and dignity of the Briti&s;h nation, was never &s;o infamou&s;ly &s;acrificed both by you and the King, as in the year 1770, by a &s;candalous &s;ecret convention with Spain, concerning Faulk|land's I&s;lands.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to dome&s;tic affairs, you have en|deavoured to erect the Sovereign into a de&s;potic tyrant; you have made him trample under foot, all laws human and divine; you have made him de&s;troy the rights and liberties of the people in every part of the Briti&s;h empire. You have made it appa|rently his intere&s;t to promote divi&s;ions at home; you have obliged him to quit the glorious title of
<PB N="46" REF="013945_0006_0F925D2580FC8C58">father of his people, and deba&s;e him&s;elf into the head of a party, whom he has inve&s;ted with an ab|&s;olute dominion over him, and whil&s;t he monarchs it in its own clo&s;et, becomes contemptible in the eyes of his &s;ubjects, and the whole world; weak, timid, and irre&s;olute, he deeply engages in all your Lord&s;hip's infamous mea&s;ures, and the re&s;t of his mini&s;ters; and it is for this rea&s;on we &s;ee every act of mini&s;terial villany and murder &s;anctified by royal authority.</P>
