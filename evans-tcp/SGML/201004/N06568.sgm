<P>THE <HI>Doctrine of Bapti&s;ins</HI> hath been dark and ob&s;cure in the Church, from the very pri|mitive Times, and hath had more of <HI>human No|tion,</HI> than of <HI>divine Truth</HI> in it; and therefore <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> writing touching this Point, &s;peaks thus, in the Beginning of his Book, intituled, <HI>De Bap.

<HEAD>THE DOCTRINE OF <HI>BAPTISMS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Lord,</HI> fore&s;eeing how great an E|vil it would be in the <HI>Church,</HI> to leave Men either to their own, or other Mens <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> in the Things of God, did, in the very Beginning of the <HI>Go&s;|pel,</HI> command and bind all the Faithful, to hear <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone; &s;aying from <HI>Heaven</HI> (that we might give ab&s;olute <HI>Credit</HI> to his Voice) <HI>This is my be|loved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear him;</HI> And the more the <HI>Faithful</HI> have kept to the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the more they have been free from <HI>Er|ror,</HI> and the more they have left <HI>this,</HI> and turned a&s;ide after the <HI>Doctrines of Men</HI> (though <HI>Men</HI> in &s;ome Mea&s;ure <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>holy</HI>) the more have they been <HI>perverted</HI> and <HI>&s;educed;</HI> in&s;omuch that the <HI>true Church of God,</HI> and the very <HI>Faithful</HI> them&s;elves, have received, held and maintained, divers <HI>Errors,</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e Doctrines,</HI> and <HI>Opinions,</HI> even for many Ages and Generations; yea, and have not been altogether free from &s;ome, from the very <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Time: And becau&s;e many, or mo&s;t, <HI>godly Men,</HI> in former Ages, held &s;uch and &s;uch <HI>Opinions;</HI> therefore the <HI>following</HI> Ages have
<PB N="6" REF="008338_0005_102F330A3AAF6448">taken them upon <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> from them, and have en|tertained them as <HI>&s;ure</HI> and <HI>certain,</HI> though not at all <HI>con&s;ulting,</HI> in tho&s;e Points, with the great <HI>Doctor</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of the New Te&s;tament, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And thus have the very <HI>Elect</HI> them&s;elves been drawn into much <HI>Error,</HI> though they have &s;till had <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for their <HI>Foundation,</HI> and were <HI>built</HI> on him &s;o firmly by <HI>Faith, that the Gates of Hell could not prevail again&s;t them.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to free the <HI>Faithful</HI> from the <HI>former Mi|&s;take</HI> (and con&s;equently from all <HI>Error</HI>) there is no other Way than this, <HI>wholly to for&s;ake the Doc|trines of Men,</HI> and to <HI>lay by</HI> all tho&s;e <HI>Opinions</HI> that we have &s;ucked in from our very <HI>Cradles,</HI> and which are now become even a <HI>natural Religion</HI> to us; I &s;ay, utterly to <HI>lay by,</HI> and wholly to forget all the&s;e Things, and to come <HI>immediately</HI> to the <HI>pure unerring Word of God,</HI> and to the Voice of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> wherein all Things are <HI>true, &s;incere</HI> and <HI>perfect;</HI> and not bring <HI>Hearts</HI> to the <HI>Word,</HI> that are prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Opinions</HI> learned of <HI>Men,</HI> but to come thither with Hearts and Con&s;ciences <HI>free</HI> and <HI>unengaged,</HI> and in all Meekne&s;s, Uprightne&s;s and Simplicity of Heart, to hear what <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>true Witne&s;s,</HI> will &s;ay by his <HI>Spi|rit,</HI> which al&s;o is the <HI>Spirit of Truth;</HI> and to re|ceive and believe <HI>that alone,</HI> though never &s;o <HI>dif|fering</HI> from the <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Doctrines</HI> of this <HI>pre&s;ent Age,</HI> as well as of the <HI>former,</HI> and tho' perhaps the whole <HI>Nation</HI> would be <HI>offended</HI> with it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008338_0006_102F330BD46FFAB8">
And <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> that I have ob&s;erved, to come to &s;ome <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>certain Knowledge</HI> in the <HI>Doctrine of Bapti&s;m:</HI> For, having <HI>read much,</HI> and <HI>di&s;cour&s;ed</HI> with <HI>many</HI> touching this <HI>Point,</HI> and having &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered what they &s;ay, as <HI>one</HI> that &s;earched after the <HI>Truth,</HI> for it&s;elf only, and for the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of my own <HI>Soul;</HI> I do profe&s;s I could not find any Thing almo&s;t &s;poken, for my Spirit <HI>boldly</HI> and <HI>&s;afely</HI> to lean on, as perceiv|ing mo&s;t of what they &s;aid, to be but the <HI>Appre|hen&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> and that they &s;poke very much by Conjecture, and at Uncertainty in this <HI>Matter;</HI> and thereupon I re&s;olved, <HI>wholly</HI> to withdraw from &s;uch <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> and to lay down whatever <HI>Opinions</HI> I had before entertained, touch|ing this <HI>Point,</HI> and to come to the <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>ma|nife&s;t Scriptures;</HI> and from <HI>thence</HI> (after much &s;eeking God) to <HI>learn</HI> whatever the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;hould plea&s;e to <HI>teach</HI> me; chu&s;ing rather to <HI>build</HI> on the <HI>clear Word,</HI> though <HI>alone,</HI> than on any <HI>uncertain Inferences,</HI> and <HI>blind Conjectures of Men,</HI> though embraced and magnified by all <HI>the World.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in this Enquiry from the <HI>Word,</HI> I met with that Place, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 2. where the Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of &s;ome of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>initial Points of Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> names the <HI>Doctrine of Bap|ti&s;ms;</HI> whence I perceived that, in the <HI>primitive Church</HI> they had the <HI>Doctrine of Bapti&s;m</HI> in the <HI>Plural Number;</HI> and therefore did apply my&s;elf to &s;earch from the <HI>Word,</HI> what the&s;e <HI>Bapti&s;ms</HI> might be, and &s;o met with the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s own <HI>Doc|trine,</HI> touching <HI>Bapti&s;ms,</HI> mentioned <HI>Matthew</HI> iii. <HI>Mark</HI> i. <HI>Luke</HI> iii. and <HI>John</HI> i.

And hav|ing thus fir&s;t &s;poken meanly of his <HI>own Bapti&s;m,</HI> and then magnified <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Per&s;on</HI> above his own, <HI>He</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>&s;hall baptize you with the Holy Spi|rit, and with Fire;</HI> that is, I that am a <HI>Servant</HI> do baptize with <HI>Water;</HI> but he, that is, the <HI>Son,</HI> baptizes with the <HI>Spirit;</HI> my <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> wa&s;hes but the <HI>Body</HI> from the Filth of the <HI>Fle&s;h;</HI> but his, the <HI>Soul</HI> from Filth of <HI>Sin;</HI> &s;o that how much the <HI>Spirit</HI> excels <HI>Water,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Creature,</HI> &s;o much his <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> tran&s;cends mine.</P>
<P>Now hence I gather <HI>clearly,</HI> even from the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s own Mouth, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s were <HI>di&s;tinct Bapti&s;ms,</HI> the one <HI>Water-Bap|ti&s;m,</HI> the other <HI>Fire-Bapti&s;m;</HI> and though our <HI>late Writers</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> have, and do affirm, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> make up but <HI>one intire Bapti&s;m;</HI> yet all generally of the <HI>antient Chri&s;tians</HI> apprehended them to be di&s;tinct; one whereof &s;aith, <HI>Illud manife&s;tum e&s;t, alium fui&s;&s;e Johannis Bapti&s;mum, alium Chri&s;ti.</HI> Augu&s;t. <HI>con|tra Liter.</HI> Petil. c. c. 37. And I could produce <HI>many</HI> more Te&s;timonies be&s;ides, but it is not my Meaning to <HI>entangle</HI> any Body with the <HI>Authority</HI> of Men, and therefore I &s;hall make it plain by
<PB N="10" REF="008338_0009_102F33142105F6D8"><HI>clear Scriptures,</HI> and Evidences from them, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, are di&s;tinct.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s are di&s;tinct in their <HI>Appellations</HI> in Scripture; for <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> was &s;till &s;o called, even when the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed it; and it was not called by <HI>their Names</HI> who admini&s;tered it, but was &s;till called <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m:</HI> Yea, after <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> came in, <HI>John</HI>'s &s;till retained its Name, as being <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from it; and therefore, <HI>Acts</HI> xviii. 24, 25. it is &s;aid, <HI>Apollos taught diligently the Things of the Lord,</HI> knowing only <HI>the Bapti&s;m of</HI> John.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>By the&s;e Things it is evident, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s are di&s;tinct; and therefore as what God hath joined, no Man ought to put a&s;under, &s;o what God hath put a&s;under, no Man ought to join; as if the <HI>Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> and <HI>incompleat,</HI> except we &s;hould add to it the <HI>Bapti&s;m of John;</HI> which is exceedingly to eclip&s;e the Brightne&s;s of the Son of God, as to draw a Vail over the greate&s;t Glory of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> which is the <HI>Bapti&s;m of the Spirit.</HI></P>

<P>And thus having cleared from the Word, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is di&s;tinct from Chri&s;t's, I &s;hall proceed to &s;peak of each of the&s;e Bapti&s;ms apart by them&s;elves, and to hold forth to others what my&s;elf have learned touching them from the &s;ame Word.</P>

2. <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m was from Heaven, and not from Men; it had its In&s;titution from God, and was not an Ordinance he took up of his own Head. <HI>Luke</HI> iii. 2. it is &s;aid, that at the Beginning of <HI>John</HI>'s &s;etting forth to his Bapti&s;m and Mini|&s;try, <HI>That the Word of God came to him in the Wilderne&s;s;</HI> that is, he was in&s;pired, in&s;tructed and taught by a Word from God him&s;elf touch|ing his Mini&s;try-Bapti&s;m, and the Di&s;covery of Chri&s;t's his was to make; and <HI>John</HI> i. 6. <HI>There was a Man &s;ent from God, who&s;e Name was</HI> John, and Ver&s;e 33. <HI>He that &s;ent me to baptize with Water, &s;aid unto me.</HI> He went not of his own Accord, but God &s;ent him to baptize; &s;o that as God was the Author of tho&s;e inferior Bap|ti&s;ms of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o of this more high and excel|lent Bapti&s;m of <HI>John;</HI> and hereupon the <HI>Publi|cans,</HI> that received <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m, are &s;aid to <HI>ju&s;tify God;</HI> and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> that refu&s;ed it, to <HI>reject again&s;t them&s;elves;</HI> that is, to their own Harm, the <HI>Coun&s;el of God,</HI> Luke vii. 29.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Chri&s;t him&s;elf,</HI> who was born under the Law, and &s;ubject to the Law, &s;ubmitted him&s;elf al&s;o to the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> as the <HI>la&s;t</HI> and <HI>livelie&s;t Ce|remony,</HI> Matt. iii. 13. <HI>Then cometh Je&s;us from</HI> Ga|lilee <HI>to</HI> Jordan, <HI>to be baptized of him,</HI> and &s;o Chri&s;t, who had &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the <HI>Cir|cumci&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;ubmitted him&s;elf al&s;o to the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John;</HI> and as he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> not for his own Sake, but for ours; &s;o al&s;o to the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John.</HI> For &s;eeing Chri&s;t was free from Sin, he &s;tood in

<P>Thus it appears, that the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John</HI> was very <HI>Honourable,</HI> and of <HI>high Account</HI> in its Time, &s;o that the very <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> took it up, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf &s;uffered them, becau&s;e <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> was the Sign and Fore-runner of his, and becau&s;e the Time of his own <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> was not yet come; but Chri&s;t him&s;elf u&s;ed it not, as <HI>John</HI> witne&s;&s;es, Chap. iv. 2. &s;aying, <HI>Je&s;us him&s;elf bap|tized not, but his Di&s;ciples;</HI> to wit, with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> which was <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m.</HI> For it be|came not the <HI>Son of God</HI> to <HI>baptize</HI> with a Crea|ture; nor the <HI>Lord</HI> of all, to u&s;e the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of a Servant.</P>
<P>And thus, having &s;hewed how <HI>Honourable John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> was in <HI>it&s;elf</HI> (wherein I conceive I have not done him, though a Servant, the lea&s;t Prejudice, but have fully attributed to his <HI>Office,</HI> whatever the Word, or he him&s;elf, a Me&s;&s;enger from God, attributes to it) I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, <HI>That the</HI> Bapti&s;m <HI>of</HI> John, <HI>how honour|able and excellent &s;oever, is yet far beneath and below</HI> Chri&s;t<HI>'s; yea and mo&s;t weak and imperfect in Compari&s;on of his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008338_0016_102F332569C55430">
For fir&s;t, <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m was with a <HI>Creature,</HI> with the <HI>Element of Water,</HI> for the <HI>Creature</HI> could baptize but with the <HI>Creature;</HI> that is, <HI>John</HI> with <HI>Water;</HI> and &s;o this was far beneath the Bapti&s;m of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which was the Work of <HI>God</HI> by <HI>God,</HI> the Work of the Father by the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Son</HI> by the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m was <HI>tantum exterius Lava|crum,</HI> but <HI>outward,</HI> and reached the outward Man only; the Bapti&s;m of Water reached but the Bo|dy, and it could pierce no deeper; and after all the Wa&s;hing of the Body with Water, the Soul &s;till remained as full of <HI>Filth, Sin,</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> as ever; and &s;o it was far beneath <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, which reaches the <HI>Soul:</HI> The Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> was the Bapti&s;m of Bodies, but the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t the Bapti&s;m of Souls; and only the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit reaches the Spirit, and attains to the Soul, Con&s;cience and inner Man, to purge and purify them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> was but a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Ceremony,</HI> though it had more <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> in it than any of the <HI>Signs</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> as being nearer to Chri&s;t, and more newly revived by God; and &s;o thought u&s;eful in its Sea&s;on, yet the Effi|cacy of it (after the Manner of all Signs) was but weak.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It did not give the Spirit one Drop of the Spirit; yea, &s;ome who were baptized with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> did not <HI>know the Way of the Lord</HI> perfectly; that is, had no certain Know|ledge of Chri&s;t, the only Way to God, as <HI>Apol|los, Acts</HI> xviii, yea, &s;ome of them did not &s;o much

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Neither did it give <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin</HI> (for what was the Plunging of a Man in cold Water towards <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin?</HI>) but the&s;e were the Works of Chri&s;t's own Bapti&s;m, which is the <HI>Bapti&s;m of the Spirit;</HI> for no Man can repent of Sin, but by the Pre&s;ence of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in his Heart, which is the Work of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is given in <HI>Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m;</HI> neither can any re|mit Sin, but God: Our Sins are never forgiven by God, till God dwell in us through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the Work of the Spirit; &s;o that <HI>Repentance</HI> was given, and <HI>Sin</HI> forgiven, not in Hope only in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> but really and truly in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, which was the real Bapti&s;m of <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Neither did it give Entrance into the the <HI>Kingdom of God;</HI> for the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> is a <HI>&s;piritual Kingdom,</HI> and no <HI>earthly</HI> or <HI>corporeal</HI> Thing can give Entrance into it: The <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> in the Water of <HI>Jordan</HI> could deliver no Man up into the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> but the <HI>Bapti&s;m in that River that makes glad the City of God,</HI> P&s;al. xlvi. 4. in that <HI>River clear as Chry&s;tal, that proceeds from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb,</HI> which is the Spirit, which delivers up all that partake of it, fir&s;t, into the Kingdom of the Son, and after, through that into the Kingdom of the Father The Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> left Men in that old World, wherein it found them, but the Bapti&s;m of
<PB N="19" REF="008338_0018_102F332988746208">Chri&s;t delivers them up into the new World, or the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now, in all the&s;e Regards, it appears that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> did not do the Work of the <HI>Bap|ti&s;m of the New Te&s;tament,</HI> for then that only had been &s;ufficient, and there had been <HI>no Need</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s to come.</P>
<P>And thus you &s;ee that the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> as it is di&s;tinct from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, &s;o it is far inferior to his. And therefore great hath been the Mi&s;take of many, for &s;everal Ages, who have made <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> equal to <HI>Chri&s;t's;</HI> for what is this, but to make the <HI>Servant</HI> equal to the <HI>Lord,</HI> and to &s;et down the <HI>Creature</HI> in the Throne of the only Be|gotten of the Father? Yea, and it is the quite perverting of <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> for <HI>John</HI> was to be a <HI>burning and &s;hining Light,</HI> to u&s;her in Chri&s;t the <HI>true Light;</HI> he was to be as the <HI>Morning|&s;tar,</HI> to u&s;her in Chri&s;t, the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and was not to be &s;o much <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> to ob&s;cure him; he was but to point out Chri&s;t, and depart again, and not to &s;it in equal Glory with him, on his Throne, in the New Te&s;tament. <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>he was not worthy to bear his Shoes;</HI> and therefore they do not well, who have prepared an equal Crown for him with Chri&s;t, who is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore we mu&s;t take great Heed that we do not &s;o magnify <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> as to intrench on Chri&s;t's, and to make the Son, out of the Bo&s;om of the Father, to take up the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> a Servant, and to admini&s;ter one entirely his
<PB N="20" REF="008338_0019_102F332CB4C016E0">own; &s;urely this would not have been &s;uitable to the <HI>Glory of the only begotten Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>The third Thing I propound to &s;peak to, touching <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> is the <HI>Time of its Dur|ance,</HI> or <HI>Continuance,</HI> and that was but very &s;hort; for <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> as all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was but for a Time; yea, this being nearer the Truth and Sub&s;tance than they, was of le&s;s Duration; as the Morning Star, though brighter than the Re&s;t of tho&s;e heavenly Lights, &s;hines le&s;s While than they, becau&s;e the ha&s;ty Appearance of the Sun &s;wallows it up. And &s;o <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> was of great U&s;e a little before Chri&s;t's Manife&s;tation to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and continued till the Time of his A&s;cen&s;ion; and then when Chri&s;t's <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> began, the Shadow was to give Way to the Sub&s;tance, and the Sign to the Truth, and the Letter to the Spirit, and the Servant to the Son; &s;o that Chri&s;t's <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> put an End to <HI>John's, Free-Bapti&s;m</HI> to <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Spi|rit-Bapti&s;m</HI> to <HI>Creature-Bapti&s;m:</HI> For as all the Prophets were until <HI>John,</HI> &s;o <HI>John</HI> was until <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and <HI>John</HI> mu&s;t no more exceed his Bounds, than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> theirs; but as the <HI>Prophets</HI> gave up to <HI>John,</HI> &s;o <HI>John</HI> mu&s;t give up to <HI>Chri&s;t.

<P>Now by <HI>Water,</HI> in all the&s;e Places, is not meant <HI>material Water,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf explicates; and &s;ure his Te&s;timony alone is &s;uffi|cient.</P>
<P>But again, if in this Place, <HI>except a Man be born of Water and Spirit,</HI> you will needs under|&s;tand <HI>material Water;</HI> why then, upon the &s;ame Ground, you mu&s;t needs under&s;tand that Place in <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>material Fire,</HI> where it is &s;aid, <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 11. <HI>He &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with Fire;</HI> which is ab&s;urd to very Rea&s;on to think; but <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> in each Place, added to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> &s;hew only the <HI>Effica|cy</HI>

<P>Now the other Place, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 19. <HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spi|rit,</HI> is al&s;o of as little Force as the former, to prove <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m to be an In&s;titution of Chri&s;t.</HI> Indeed I find, that where ever Men have met with the Word <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> or <HI>baptize</HI> in the Scrip|tures, pre&s;ently their Thoughts have de&s;cended to <HI>material Water;</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> not &s;o well con&s;idering or under&s;tanding that <HI>Water,</HI> which is the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is the only <HI>Water</HI> that performs all the <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> in the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now for that Place, <HI>Go teach all Nations, bap|tizing them,</HI> they under&s;tand it thus, <HI>teach them,</HI> and <HI>baptize them</HI> with material <HI>Water,</HI> u&s;ing this Form of Words, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>So that this Place cannot be under&s;tood of <HI>Wa|ter,</HI> but in&s;tead of baptizing in material Water, as <HI>John,</HI> he tells them, they &s;hould <HI>baptize into the Name of God,</HI> in &s;uch Sort, that they that were before &s;inful, corrupt, and evil Men, &s;hould now be taken up into the Glory of the <HI>Name</HI> of God.

And becau&s;e many will pre&s;ently be ready to be enraged at this <HI>A&s;&s;ertion,</HI> I will a little cool their Heat with what <HI>Zuinglius</HI> &s;aith of this Place, who was one of the greate&s;t Enemies to the <HI>Anabap|ti&s;ts,</HI> that was in his Time; <HI>Chri&s;tus Je&s;us</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>Bapti&s;mi Formulam, qua uteremur his Verbis, non in&s;tituit, quemadmodum Theologi hactenus fal&s;o tradierunt,</HI> Zuing.

<P>Again, if by this Place, <HI>go teach and baptize,</HI> be meant <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m, Paul</HI> did very ill ob&s;erve the Command of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who <HI>baptized</HI> but two or three believing Families at the mo&s;t, with <HI>Wa|ter-Bapti&s;m,</HI> and yet preached the <HI>Word</HI> in a Cir|cuit from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Illiricum, Acts</HI> xv. 19. through many <HI>Kingdoms, Countries, Villages, People;</HI> but I &s;ay <HI>Paul,</HI> though he u&s;ed not <HI>Water-Bap|ti&s;m,</HI> yet did punctually fulfil the <HI>Command</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>did teach them, and baptize them into the Name of God.</HI> So that, no Que&s;tion, there were many Churches planted in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Time, who believed in Chri&s;t, and received the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and walked in Fellow&s;hip with the <HI>Father and the Son,</HI> and with one another in the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> who never were wa&s;hed at all with <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m;</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="008338_0027_102F333FC7259318">but <HI>Paul</HI> knew well, that no outward Thing is of any Account in the Kingdom of God; and that as <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Uncircumci&s;ion</HI> were nothing, &s;o neither <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> nor the Want of it, were any Thing, but a <HI>new Creature is ALL;</HI> and if there be <HI>Faith</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> they are &s;ufficient to the Kingdom of God, with|out any outward Ceremonies what&s;oever.</P>

<P>And thus, in all the&s;e Particulars, you &s;ee the infinite Excellency and Glory of the <HI>Spirit-Bap|ti&s;m</HI> above <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> and this only is &s;uffi|cient in the Days of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as being the true and proper <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament;</HI> for as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf only is &s;ufficient to the Faithful without <HI>John,</HI> though <HI>John</HI> were of U&s;e in this Sea|&s;on, to point out <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> only is &s;ufficient to the Faithful, without the <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> though the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>John</HI> were of U&s;e in its Sea&s;on, to point out the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> him&s;elf was of this Judg|ment, who &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <HI>I have Need to be bap|tized of thee;</HI> which he means not of <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m</HI> (for &s;o <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, as you have heard, <HI>did not baptize</HI>) but with the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Spi|rit,</HI> and &s;o the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, who was never baptized with <HI>Water,</HI> neither by Chri&s;t nor the A|po&s;tles, nor any Body el&s;e, yet was baptized with the Spirit; and the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit was &s;uf|ficient for the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> without any Water-Bap|ti&s;m; and &s;o Chri&s;t's Spirit-Bapti&s;m, by the Word, is &s;ufficient for all the Faithful now, with|out <HI>John</HI>'s Water-Bapti&s;m; for he that is truly wa&s;hed from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit, and hath the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in him, to renew his Nature, and to conform him exactly to Chri&s;t's own Image, and to work him in this pre&s;ent World into the true Similitude of Heaven, and
<PB N="43" REF="008338_0042_102F3366CAE67B48">to be in him a <HI>Fountain of Water &s;pringing up unto everla&s;ting Life;</HI> what Need hath he of cold material Water to be poured on his Body, under the Pretence of any Sign whatever, either of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> when as he hath the Truth, Sub|&s;tance, and heavenly Thing it&s;elf?</P>
<P>Now this, it may be, may &s;eem &s;trange and dangerous to &s;ome of low, and fle&s;hly, and cu&s;|tomary Religion, but let all &s;uch (if it be po&s;&s;ible) con&s;ider, that where the Sub&s;tance comes the Shadow is at an End, and the Ceremony where the Truth comes, and the Creature where <HI>God</HI> comes: And if they under&s;tand not this for the pre&s;ent, I hope they may under&s;tand it afterwards, for we &s;peak not at Uncertainties in this Point, but what we have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;een, and felt, and <HI>handled of the Word of Life, that we deliver to you, that ye may have Fellow&s;hip with us; and truly our Fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> through the Spirit.</P>
