<Q><BIBL><HI>ECCL. xi. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth; and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the &s;ight of thine Eyes; but know thou, that for all <HI>the&s;e Things</HI> God will bring thee into Judgment.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I De&s;ire with all my Heart and Soul, to ble&s;s the Name of the great GOD, who has inclined the Heart of &s;o many to attend upon him in his Hou&s;e this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004727_0005_100DCDFDAFA50968">
I thank, not only the dear People of my Charge, but tho&s;e al&s;o of other Places, and e&s;pecially you, that are in your Youth, for a&s;&s;embling your &s;elves &s;o readily into the Hou&s;e of the LORD, and coming to wor|&s;hip toward His holy Temple, and &s;it under the Droppings of His Sanctuary on this Day, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">General Election at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></NOTE> which you u&s;ed to devote to Merri|ment, vain and too often &s;inful Diver&s;ion. And while I &s;ee &s;o large a Congregation, and e&s;pecially &s;uch Numbers of young Peo|ple around me; how might it animate me (if Po&s;&s;ible) to &s;ay &s;omething on this Oc|ca&s;ion to you, that might indeed profit your Souls.</P>
<P>Depending on divine Help, I &s;hall en|deavour to offer to your Con&s;ideration, &s;ome plain and &s;erious Truths from the Text now read, <HI>Rejoice,</HI> O <HI>young Man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this excellent Sermon written by King <HI>SOLOMON,</HI> under divine In&s;piration, the Point to be demon&s;trated was, that all world|ly Enjoyments, carnal Plea&s;ure, Wealth, Honour, and even humane Wi&s;dom and Learning, are Vanity of Vanities; unworthy of any E&s;teem or Regard, when compa|red with the Enjoyment of the Favour of God, the true Plea&s;ures of Religion; and
<PB N="7" REF="004727_0006_100DCDFF9D04B9E8">that &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, which is expre&s;&s;ed in the filial Fear of God, and Conformity to His Will.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;ertion our divine Preacher has proved, by an Induction of Particulars; and when he is come near to the clo&s;e of his Sermon, he makes, what we &s;hould call, in an humane Author, an hand&s;ome Addre&s;s to the Youth, in our Text and onward. And applys what he had &s;aid to them, to us who are in our Youth; as to tho&s;e that are mo&s;t prone to be led a&s;tray by the Vanities of this World: And for them to neglect the mo&s;t &s;olid and valuable Enjoyments, offered to the faithful Servants of the <HI>mo&s;t High.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text begins this Addre&s;s, and giveth us a Rule by which to mea&s;ure our pur&s;uit of this World's Enjoyments, and our indul|gence of Plea&s;ure, viz. <HI>The weight that all our Actions &s;hall re&s;pectively have at the Judg|ment-&s;eat of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth&mdash;but know thou that for all</HI> the&s;e Things <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>As if he has &s;aid, "O young Man, or Woman, who take&s;t mo&s;t delight in the vain Plea&s;ures of this Life, go on to rejoyce therein while in thy Youth, <HI>and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth;</HI> let nothing hinder, but every thing con&s;pire to promote
<PB N="8" REF="004727_0007_100DCE01A1B17530">this youthful rejoicing; let thy Fancy and brisk Imagination chear thee, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Repre&s;entation of all Things around you; thus adding to the rejoicing that even a Youth could otherwi&s;e indulge. <HI>And walk in the way of thy Heart;</HI> whatever way for worldly Plea&s;ure, your youthful Heart and lively Imagination &s;hall dictate to you, readily go in that Path, never fail of follow|ing &s;uch a Tract. &mdash; <HI>And in the &s;ight of thine Eyes.</HI> If your Eyes di&s;cover any Object that your Heart de&s;ires; pur&s;ue and obtain it: Let your outward Sen&s;es, lively Fancy, youthful Briskne&s;s and merry Indulgencies all increa&s;e the Plea&s;ures of your early Years: But know it for a certainty, that all the&s;e Things mu&s;t be called over again, at the great Day of Accounts. It may be, many of your early Plea&s;ures are concealed from the view of Men; but the great GOD will bring them into Judgment, will publi&s;h them all in open Day, before all the Worlds of Men and Angels; and will &s;entence you according to their &s;trict Demerit." Know it, O young People, that hear me, that all your youthful Plea&s;ures, chearful Amu&s;ements merry Days and Nights and Hours, &s;hall be remembred then, and have their ju&s;t weight in the Sentence of <HI>that Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004727_0008_100DCE03359B1178">
This Text is therefore, a <HI>&s;erious Exhorta|tion</HI> to the Youth, to take the Comfort of their Life, and the Plea&s;ure proper to their Age; only to regulate even their chearful Sea&s;ons, by a due Remembrance of <HI>the Day,</HI> when they mu&s;t appear at the Bar of CHRIST, and render an Account of all the&s;e things among others. And the wi&s;e Man then tells us, we may have much Plea|&s;ure in youth: But that it mu&s;t be &s;uch as will bear the Light of that awful Day.</P>
<P>Or, the Text is a <HI>cutting Sarca&s;m,</HI> where|in the meaning is directly oppo&s;ite to the literal Sen&s;e of the Words. And becau&s;e King <HI>SOLOMON</HI> knew that young Per&s;ons are exceeding fond of carnal and worldly Plea&s;ure, he bids them rejoice and chear them&s;elves in it, to the utmo&s;t that their Heart could wi&s;h. "Be merry, O young People, as you plea&s;e, as you can; but be &s;o at your Peril: Know that the great GOD &s;ees you, will bring you to Judgment, and pa&s;s a Sentence infinitely ju&s;t upon you; for <HI>all</HI> the&s;e things. This La&s;t, &s;eems to me the true Sen&s;e of the Text. But be it either; the Words naturally afford us this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That young People &s;hould indulge them&s;elves, in no more Chearfulne&s;s and Merriment, than they can give a good Account of, to the great</HI> JUDGE.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004727_0009_100DCE0660AB6740">
It is equally true, that no Per&s;ons of what|ever Age, &s;hould indulge them&s;elves in any &s;ort of Plea&s;ure of which they cannot give a good Account at the great DAY. But becau&s;e the Text is, as I &s;aid, an Addre&s;s to the Youth, and the Occa&s;ion, and the Numbers of the Age in this A&s;&s;embly, de|termine me to expre&s;s the Ob&s;ervation as above: For the Word of the LORD is un|to you, O young People, in &s;pecial: For <HI>each</HI> of you: and therefore let me beg, and let me have, your mo&s;t &s;erious Attention.</P>
<P>The general Propo&s;ition is directly prov|ed by the Text: Rejoice &mdash; but go no further in your rejoicing than you can, when under the full and proper Sen&s;e, that it mu&s;t &s;oon be accounted for. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a Chearfulne&s;s and Rejoicing that is allowable</HI> Eccl. 7.14. <HI>In the Day of Pro&s;perity be J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ful.</HI> We &s;hould take notice of, and take plea&s;ure in, the Expre&s;&s;ions of divine Bounty towards us. Our Spirits &s;hould be cheared when we experience, or reflect on His Ble&s;&s;ings: But then this Joy and Chear|fulne&s;s, &s;hould always be a Joy of Thanks|giving. This Joy of Heart &s;hould be, in a &s;ort, an inward, habitual Thankfulne&s;s to the Author of our Comfort. P&s;. 95.1, 2. <HI>O come let us &s;ing unto the LORD: Let us make a joyful noi&s;e, unto the rock of our Salvation.
<PB N="11" REF="004727_0010_100DCE081B01C5C8">Let us come before his Pre&s;ence with Thanksgi|ving, and make a joyful Noi&s;e unto him with P&s;alms,</HI> compar'd with 1 The&s;. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">8. <HI>In every Thing give Thanks,</HI> And, James 5.3. &mdash; <HI>Is any merry, let him &s;ing P&s;alms.</HI></P>
<P>There is a rejoicing in the Lord, that the Saints &s;hould exerci&s;e both in Pro&s;pe|rity and Adver&s;ity, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.4. an holy, hum|ble Joy in this, that the LORD is infinite in all his Attributes, and that he is their Portion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Chearfulne&s;s we &s;peak of, &s;hould be of &s;uch a King and Degree, as the Per&s;on indulging it, can give a good Account of, to the great Judge.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only offer a few Rea&s;ons to con|firm this Propo&s;ition, and pa&s;s to the Ap|plication.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e it is ab&s;olutely certain, that <HI>there is a Judgment Day approaching.</HI> This is an Article of the Chri&s;tian Faith, plainly revealed and ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;erted in our Bi|ble. In the Text particularly, <HI>Know thou that for all the&s;e Things God will bring thee into Judgment. Know Ye,</HI> is a Term an humane Conveyance denoting ab&s;olute Certainty: And a like Phra&s;e is u&s;ed in our Text, &s;et|ting forth the Certainty of the Judgment Day; <HI>Know thou &mdash; Rev.</HI> 20.11, 12, 13. And I &s;aw a great white Throne, and him
<PB N="12" REF="004727_0011_100DCE0B5D320B78">that &s;at on it, from who&s;e Face the Earth and the Heaven fled away, and there was found no Place for them. And I &s;aw the dead, &s;mall and great &s;tand before GOD; and the Books were opened: And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life, and the Dead were judged out of tho&s;e Things which were written in the Books according to their Works. And the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the Dead which were in them: and they were judged, every Man according to their Works. After the&s;e Texts you do not deny the Certainty of the Day of Judgment; you dare not deny it.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 2. Becau&s;e all the Kinds &amp; Degrees of Men's rejoicing and chearfulne&s;s, <HI>&s;hall be brought into Judgment.</HI> They &s;hall be reckoned for, Eccl. 12.14. <HI>For God &s;hall bring every Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</HI> And if every Work, with every &s;ecret Thing, then certainly, every cheerful, every merry Day and Hour; yea, and Minute; all the Circum&s;tances, Kinds and Degrees thereof. O young People, You think perhaps this Con&s;ideration is very &s;erious. It is &s;o: But not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;erious than true. Every Mo|ment that you &s;pend in any &s;ort of Merri|ment,
<PB N="13" REF="004727_0012_100DCE0D6CB01BF8">&s;hall be called over at the great Day of Accounts. Your Companions perhaps entice you; "Come, &s;ay they, Let us go and &s;pend this Day, or this Evening mer|rily; let us go to &s;uch an Hou&s;e; there we may &s;ing, dance, carou&s;e, and be as jolly as we plea&s;e: we &s;hall be out of the reach of our Parents; they won't hear us; and the Folks there, with not check us." Go, I &s;ay, Go, O vain Youth, with them; but maintain this Thought continually, That GOD's Eye is upon you, when you go, while you are there, and when you return; and ob&s;erves every Tho't, every Word and Action, and He will bring you into Judgment for <HI>All</HI> the&s;e Things. Be cheerful as you plea&s;e, under a proper, regulating, Heart-deep Sen&s;e, that every Degree of this Cheerfulne&s;s &s;hall be accounted for at the Bar of CHRIST. Be profanely rude, or needle&s;ly company with your vain Companions, if they are profanely rude, at your Peril; &s;ince all the Circum&s;tances of your Merriment mu&s;t be in full recounted by you before the great Judge, when Time &s;hall be no more. And this &s;urely is a weighty Rea&s;on, why the King &amp; Degree of your Cheerfulne&s;s &s;hould be &s;uch, as you can then give a good Ac|count of.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004727_0013_100DCE1040A8A7C8">
<HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 3. Becau&s;e the infinite GOD is <HI>en|gaged</HI> to bring Per&s;ons to Judgment for the&s;e Things. If only the mo&s;t powerful Men, or even the highe&s;t Angels in Heaven, where en|gaged to bring <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> into Judgment for the&s;e Things, <HI>they</HI> might imagine a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of e&s;caping that Trial. For, it is po&s;&s;i|ble the highe&s;t created Wi&s;dom or Power might fail. But, O young Man, O young Woman, an infinite, omni&s;cient Eye is en|gaged to find thee, wherever thou maye&s;t be; infinite Power, to bring thee to that BAR; infinite Ju&s;tice requires it; and in|finite Truth hath &s;poken it, Text, <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> Ch. 12.14. Indeed, Angels may be improv'd as In&s;truments, to gather all Nations, and every individual Per&s;on, to that great A&s;&s;embly, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.41, 42. But they are no more than In&s;tru|ments; and if we might &s;uppo&s;e them all to fail, yet all Per&s;ons &s;hould be gather'd before the Son of Man, when he &s;hall come in his Glory, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.32.</P>
<P>And I appeal to <HI>You;</HI> Do <HI>you</HI> not believe this, That GOD Almighty is engaged to bring <HI>you</HI> to an Account at la&s;t, for every idle Word, for every idle Hour, for every merry Meeting, &amp;c? You do believe it: I &s;uppo&s;e, not one Soul of <HI>you</HI> pretends to deny it. Ponder this, and &s;ay, Is it not a
<PB N="15" REF="004727_0014_100DCE1385166228">weighty Rea&s;on, why <HI>you</HI> in particular &s;hould have even your Cheerfulne&s;s, of &s;uch Kind and Degree, as <HI>you</HI> can give a good Ac|count of to this infinite Judge?</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 4. The Fourth and la&s;t Rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e the Judgment of that Day is <HI>Final;</HI> the Sentence for <HI>Eternity.</HI> There lies no Appeal from that Tribunal. You, you that hear me, Young and Old, can have no af|ter Trial. When Sentence is pa&s;&s;ed upon you by the GREAT JUDGE, it is deci&s;ive: It determines your Ca&s;e for Eternity, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. ult. <HI>And the&s;e &s;hall go away into</HI> everla&s;t|ing <HI>Puni&s;hment; but the Righteous into Life</HI> eternal. Eternal! Everla&s;ting! how ex|ten&s;ive the Term! Stretch your Thoughts forward into Eternity: Think what, think how long it is. Oh! <HI>Eternity! Eternity!</HI> how amazing the Thought! It &s;wallows up our Soul, and Words are u&s;ele&s;s. But con&s;ider, that the Sentence to be pa&s;&s;ed, at the la&s;t awful Day, &s;hall determine your State for this endle&s;s Eternity. And think, if this be not a &s;ufficient <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> why you &s;hould take Care to have even your Cheer|fulne&s;s, of &s;uch a Kind and Degree, as may, through Grace, have a favourable Sentence pronounced upon it; and a joyful ETER|NITY the Con&s;equence.</P>

<P>Is it as we have heard, That our Cheer|fulne&s;s &s;hould be of &s;uch a <HI>Kind</HI> and <HI>Degree, as we can give a good Account of to the great</HI> JUDGE? Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. How <HI>&s;trange,</HI> and <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent with this Rule,</HI> hath been the Conduct of the be&s;t Men among us!

<P N="1">1 <HI>Branch.</HI> Let us order our whole Con|ver&s;ation, and e&s;pecially our <HI>Merriment and Chearfulne&s;s</HI> by this Rule, viz. <HI>So as we may be able to give a good Account of it.</HI> Let us &s;ee to it, that it be always of &s;uch a Kind and Degree, as we may indeed be able to hold up our Head with Comfort, on that mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> Day, and freely own what we have done; that we may then be willing to re|member, that thus we &s;pent &s;uch an Even|ing, or &s;uch an Hour, when it was our Du|ty to amu&s;e our &s;elves, and a little unbend the Mind.</P>

<P><PB N="22" REF="004727_0021_100DCE269EC46F30">
<HI>Object.</HI> But young People e&s;pecially will object, <HI>That to act with &s;uch a continual Re|gard to the Day of Judgment, will take away all the Comfort of their Life; and e&s;pecially of their merry Days and Hours.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What if it doth as the Objection &s;ays?</HI> Think &s;eriou&s;ly, O young People, on a few Things. Is it not a Reality that there is &s;uch a Judg|ment Day coming? You do not, nor dare you deny it. By going on carele&s;s and free in Sin, you might perhaps keep the Tho'ts of that Day out of your Mind a little while: But is it not better, much more prudent and &s;afe, to act agreable to the real Nature of Things? Or had you rather go on in vain Cour&s;es, taking your fill of carnal Plea&s;ures, as in a Dream, fancying that there will be a Reckoning-Day, when all the&s;e Things &s;hall be brought into Judgment; but not realizing it, till you &s;hall be &s;uddenly &s;ur|prized by that Day? Would you choo&s;e this? Can you think this &s;afer, than to be deprived of your carnal, vain Delights? Or even of all that you call Plea&s;ure in this World?</P>
<P>Is not the Sentence to be pa&s;&s;ed on <HI>every One</HI> at that Day for Eternity? And is it not rea&s;onable then, that in your Diver&s;ions you &s;hould be &s;o far impre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="004727_0022_100DCDB1B1DC9660">of that Day, and that Sentence, as to keep you from acting, what you cannot then ac|count well for; altho' it might at pre&s;ent deprive you of your Comfort? Think clo&s;e|ly upon this Que&s;tion; and &s;ee if there is not great weight in it. Is it not better to be deprived of Comfort a Minute, than to &s;uf|fer the Torments of Hell a Thou&s;and Years, for the &s;inful Plea&s;ures of a Minute? You mu&s;t grant, it is. And you know that if you &s;o act here, as you cannot give a good Ac|count of, nor obtain a favourable Sentence at la&s;t, you mu&s;t &s;uffer as many Millions of Ages in Hell, as you enjoyed &s;ingle Mi|nutes of Plea&s;ure on Earth: And then be no nearer the End of your Mi&s;ery, than at the fir&s;t Moment it began. The Argument is very plain. Con&s;ider then whether this <HI>Objection</HI> again&s;t the foregoing Arguments has any Weight in it, &s;uppo&s;ing the Ob|jection it &s;elf were true. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Objection it &s;elf is <HI>fal&s;e &amp; groundle&s;s.</HI> For infinite Wi&s;dom it &s;elf a&s;&s;ures us that the Ways of Wi&s;dom are Ways of Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, and that <HI>All</HI> her Paths are Peace. And Experience has ever witne&s;&s;ed to the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The penitential Per&s;on, as his Tears are the Joy of Angels, &s;o they are the Joy of his Heart, and the &s;olace of his Soul; the &s;alter his Tears, the &s;weeter his Comforts; the deeper his Sighs, the fuller his Joy; the Beams of Con&s;olation always &s;hine into this Hou&s;e of Mourn|ing, &s;o that his Soul is in travel with a <HI>Barnabas.</HI> and his Labours bring forth the Fruits of Peace; in&s;omuch, that I may truly &s;ay, To mourn for Sin, is to weep for Joy. The&s;e pure and plea&s;ant Streams of Con&s;olation, (which is the Worldlings Wonder) that flow and run in tho&s;e Chry&s;tal Rivers of eternal Plea&s;ures, at GOD's Right Hand, they come from a weeping Spring. Why then is the Mouth of Wickedne&s;s opened again&s;t the Way of Holine&s;s? As if Grace were the <HI>Calvary</HI> to entomb Joy, and Impiety the very Womb to bring forth Felicity; but if Experience may be heard, my Soul hath felt both, and I find &s;uch Damps of Spirit in worldly Plea&s;ures, and &s;uch refre&s;hing of Soul in the Depth of godly Sorrow, that I &s;hall e&s;teem one Drop of &s;piritual Joy better than an Ocean of their carnal Mirth." <HI>Divine Breathings.</HI></NOTE>.

And if the
<PB N="25" REF="004727_0024_100DCE2E029919A0">Satisfaction of Soul, in the Depth of Humi|liation and Sorrow for Sin far exceeds in Plea&s;antne&s;s, all vain and &s;inful Gratifica|tions and Merriment, how far &s;uperiour is the religious Delight in the Soul; when the poor humbled Sinner is rai&s;ed out of the Du&s;t, bro't up out of the horrible Pit, and the miry Clay, and his Feet are &s;et upon a Rock? When the weary Soul finds re&s;t in CHRIST; and receives the Spirit of A|doption, breathes a Child-like Temper to|wards his heavenly Father, and feels his Fa|ther and his deare&s;t Saviour manife&s;ting di|vine Perfection and divine Love unto him. And when he ta&s;tes heavenly Joy in the &s;weet Incomes of divine Grace; even the Joy of the HOLY GHOST, when his Soul is filled with the Love of GOD, Oh! how far doth this exceed all the Plea&s;ures of Sin? How doth it render them exceeding bitter, in the Remembrance of them!</P>
<P>How unrea&s;onable is the Objection when &s;uch Delights as the&s;e are offered to you, in lieu of tho&s;e Things, which may not be cal|led Plea&s;ures, without an Epithet, to &s;how that they are vain, hateful and dangerous! <HI>But more of this afterward.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome will grant the former Ob|jection is an&s;wered, and they intend here|after to conduct them&s;elves &s;o as they may
<PB N="26" REF="004727_0025_100D87A926C93EB8">be able to give a good Account even of their Hours of Diver&s;ion. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Object.</HI> That <HI>they cannot begin immediate|ly &s;o to do,</HI> and that it will be Time enough when they have &s;pent &s;o many Days more, or have an&s;wered &s;uch and &s;uch Agreements with &s;ome vain Companions, or the like.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer <HI>in general</HI> to this, That e|very one of us, from this Moment, &s;hould &s;o act at all Sea&s;ons, as we may able to give a good Account thereof to the Great Judge.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If you are re&s;olved to go on in Sin, one Day, or one Hour more, you are this Moment an unconverted Wretch. A true Convert may, thro' the <HI>Power</HI> of Temptati|on, de&s;ign to commit &s;ome one Sin, as <HI>David</HI> premeditated the Murder of <HI>Uriah:</HI> but for any one deliberately to de&s;ign a continu|ance in Sin, and to delay turning from Sin to GOD, is an undeniable Token that he is in love with Sin, and, by con&s;equence &s;till at Enmity with GOD. For the true Con|vert, who loves the Lord JESUS CHRIST in &s;incerity, thinks the Time long already that he has lived in Sin; and that it is high Time to cea&s;e Crucifying the LORD of LIFE.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps you may not have <HI>Time</HI> to re|pent, <HI>after the pre&s;ent Day, You</HI> know you are
<PB N="27" REF="004727_0026_100DCE30970FC348">uncertain, whether your Soul &s;hall not be required of you this Night. And if it &s;hould, will it be Time enough hereafter to repent and turn from all Sin to GOD? You will indeed have an Eternity to repent in, but then your Repentance will be in vain, there &s;hall then remain no more Sacrifice for <HI>your</HI> Sins, <HI>who</HI> have not repented till the Decree has brought forth again&s;t you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be&s;ides, thirdly, the infinite GOD &s;ays <HI>To Day (if you will hear his Voice)</HI> harden not your Hearts. P&s;. 95.7, 8. and, <HI>That it is time</HI> (this Day) to &s;eek the LORD. Ho&s;. 10.12. And will you &s;ay, hereafter is Time enough to repent of your Sins and effectually to &s;eek the LORD? dare you impudently think or &s;ay, it will be Time enough for you to turn and &s;eek the LORD, when you have had one Frolick more, when you have gone on in Sin a few Days, Months, or Years more? Knowe&s;t thou, O vain Youth, better than the alwi&s;e GOD, when is the <HI>be&s;t Time</HI> for you to repent and turn &mdash;? You &s;ay, No; but your <HI>Practice</HI> proves, you think you do, if you go on any longer in Sin, pleading that hereafter is Time enough for you to become &s;trict and hearty in Go&s;pel-Obedi|ence: Or <HI>it</HI> plainly &s;ays, with <HI>Pharoah, who is the LORD that I &s;hould obey him,</HI> it is Time enough to obey him hereafter, as much as I
<PB N="28" REF="004727_0027_100DCE32930D4608">know of him, <HI>I will not</HI> yet <HI>obey him.</HI> This is the Language of the la&s;t <HI>Objection.</HI> Who is there among you, that dare any longer adhere to <HI>it?</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps the young People that hear me, will think <HI>mine</HI> a thankle&s;s <HI>Office</HI> to Day; while I endeavour to make them heart-&s;ick of their &s;inful Plea&s;ures, unle&s;s I direct them to &s;uperior Delight. Therefore the</P>
<P>2d. <HI>Branch</HI> of the Exhortation is. <HI>Get an Intere&s;t in JESUS CHRIST, and then may you rejoice on the be&s;t Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>Now in order this,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>You mu&s;t be deeply convinced of your</HI> Origi|nal <HI>and</HI> Actual <HI>Sins.</HI> Of indwelling Sin, and it's out-breakings. Of the Danger you are in of eternal Death and Mi&s;ery&punc; Of your Vilene&s;s and Pollution in the &s;ight of an Holy GOD. On the&s;e Accounts you mu&s;t be deeply humbled, <HI>weary and heavy-laden.</HI> Mat. 11.28. You mu&s;t find and feel that you have de&s;troyed, but cannot help your|&s;elves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>You mu&s;t</HI> hate <HI>and</HI> for&s;ake <HI>every fal&s;e Way.</HI> Every Sin; of Thought, Word and Deed&punc; A Sin as dear as a right Hand, or a right Eye, mu&s;t be hated and for&s;aken. For&s;aking Sin and outward Reformation will never prove your Title to divine Joy and Plea&s;ure, unle&s;s you inwardly hate <HI>Sin.</HI> And we cannot be|lieve
<PB N="29" REF="004727_0028_100DCE34ABFD5658">you hate <HI>it,</HI> unle&s;s you for&s;ake it, un|le&s;s you turn from it in Affection and in your ordinary, allowed Cour&s;e, and really grieve and mourn when you fall into Sin, tho' it be in &s;ecret. Yea, and grieve for your in|ward, natural Di&s;po&s;ition to Sin. Rom. 7.23, 24. Mat. 6.24. <HI>No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one and de|&s;pi&s;e the other.

<P>Thus do, O young Man, and thou may&s;t rejoice in thy Youth; thy Heart may chear thee, in the Days of thy Youth. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1, 2. Therefore being ju&s;tified by Faith, <HI>we have Peace with GOD</HI> thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST: By whom al&s;o we have ac|ce&s;s by Faith into this Grace wherein we &s;tand, <HI>and rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI> v 3, 4, 5.
