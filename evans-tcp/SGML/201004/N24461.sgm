<P>IT is &s;ome months &s;ince I read your Book entitled "The Age of Rea&s;on, part &s;econd, being an inve&s;tigation of true and fabulous Theology:" and do not &s;cruple to pronounce it one of the mo&s;t violent and &s;y&s;timatic attacks on the word of God, that ever was made; not on 'ac|count of the novelty of the objections contained therein, for in truth there is no novelty in them, but from the acri|mony and abu&s;e; the illiberal &s;atire, pretended ridicule, and impertinent wit|tici&s;m, &s;o liberally &s;cattered throughout the performance; and which, coming from the pen of a man that has acted &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part on the theatre of the political world; and who&s;e writings have been read with avidity in almo&s;t all parts of Europe, may perhaps, be of fatal

But, although &s;everal an&s;wers have been written, by men of great abilities, yet, I humbly pre&s;ume to think, that there is &s;till much to be &s;aid on the &s;ub|ject: e&s;pecially as you &s;eem to treat Chri&s;tian prie&s;ts and preachers with &s;uch contempt, that it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed you pay but little attention to their arguments, as you think<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 2 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> p. 2.</NOTE> "that they only wa&s;te their time, and heat them&s;elves in frac|tious

It therefore is to be hoped that the&s;e letters, written by one that is neither a Chri&s;tian prie&s;t, nor a preacher; and who con&s;equently has no intere&s;t in preaching up tithes, as he is but a poor, &s;imple <HI>Levite,</HI> without any living in the Jewi&s;h Church, may find grace in your &s;ight, and not be con&s;idered as "cobwebs bru&s;hed away by accident;" and thus obtain a favourable reception, not in the vain hope of making you a pro&s;elyte to revelation, but only to &s;hew you, that you are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a thorough knowledge of the &s;ubject of which you treat: it therefore, is no wonder, that you have blindly followed Morgan, Tin|dal, Bolingbroke, Hume, Voltaire, Spi|noza, &amp;c. all of whom, have long &s;ince &s;tarted one or other of the objections, that you have been collecting as it were

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not my intention in the&s;e Letters to follow you &s;tep by &s;tep through all your turnings and windings, as that would an&s;wer no other end but to bewilder the Reader, as &s;eems to have been your inten|tion: it will be &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e, if we can prove the ab&s;urdity and fal&s;ity of your po&s;ition, in the plaine&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible: I &s;hall, therefore, con&s;ider your objections again&s;t the Old Te&s;tament, in the following order: Fir&s;t, as to Mo&s;es being the Author of the books a&s;cribed to him. Second, as to the doctrines con|tained in tho&s;e books. After which I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider your objections to the prophets, the phrophetical books, as al&s;o the others contained in the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve, (p. 5.) "My intention is to &s;hew that tho&s;e books (the five books of Mo&s;es) are &s;purious, and that Mo&s;es is
<PB N="9" REF="032376_0008_0FF1FFB605677BE0">not the author of them: and &s;till further, that they were not written in the time of Mo&s;es, nor till &s;everal hundred years af|terwards," &amp;c. The proofs you adduce, are, fir&s;t, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 6.</NOTE> "the whole of the&s;e books is in the third per&s;on; it is always the <HI>Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, or Mo&s;es &s;aid unto the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. and this," you ob&s;erve, "is the &s;tyle and manner that hi&s;torians u&s;e, in &s;peaking of the per&s;ons who&s;e lives and actions they are writing." Thus you argue, to prove that Mo&s;es did not write the Pentateuch: though, as if &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of your argument, you &s;eem to abandon it immediately after, by al|lowing that, according to grammatical right, a man may &s;peak of him&s;elf in that manner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This we know without your conce&s;&s;ion: for <HI>Cae&s;ar, Xenophen,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> writing of them&s;elves, wrote in the third per&s;on.</NOTE>. But, if you had the lea&s;t know|ledge of the language in which Mo&s;es wrote, its genius, idiom and phra&s;eology, &s;o different from all others, you would certainly not have trifled thus with your readers: for allowing your objection all
<PB N="10" REF="032376_0009_0FF1FFB9CEAF3378">its force, it does not prove that Mo&s;es was not the author of the Pentateuch; nay, it in &s;ome mea&s;ure proves that he was the author: this will clearly be per|ceived, when we con&s;ider the different parts of the Pentateuch; and arrange them under their proper heads, viz. <HI>Hi&s;|torical</HI> and <HI>Preceptical.</HI> Now, as &s;ome parts are purely hi&s;torical, it was proper that he &s;hould write in the &s;tyle that hi&s;|torians generally write in. For in the name of goodne&s;s, let me a&s;k, in what other &s;tyle ought Mo&s;es to have written when he wrote the hi&s;torical part of the Pentateuch? The whole book of Gene&s;is is hi&s;torical, and the facts related therein, are prior to the birth of Mo&s;es: he mu&s;t therefore have received an account of them; and this account, he received from God; he therefore, very properly, wrote as one that is dictated to by another. And this, he expre&s;sly informs us of him|&s;elf, Numb. xxxiii. 2. <HI>"And Mo&s;es wrote their goings out according to their journies, according to the word</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. Mouth.</NOTE> <HI>of the Lord."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032376_0010_0FF1FFC10F63A2E0">
Hence the propriety of Mo&s;es writing in the third per&s;on, as an hi&s;torian, is ma|nife&s;t; and which, if duly con&s;idered, will pre&s;ently &s;hew the futility of your rea&s;on|ing on the &s;ubject; for as Mo&s;es wrote what God dictated to him, your objection to the hi&s;torical and chronological evi|dence, in&s;tantly falls to the ground: for as God is Omni&s;cient; with him there can be no futurity; he could therefore, as ea&s;ily in&s;truct Mo&s;es to write what was to happen in five or &s;ix hundred years, as he was able to acquaint him with what happened at the creation, or on the very day that Mo|&s;es wrote. Hence al&s;o, it is manife&s;t that, your objection again&s;t the expre&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es, (Gen. chap. xiv. ver. 14.) of A|braham's pur&s;uing the enemy to Dan, "that there was no &s;uch place as Dan till many years after the death of Mo&s;es; and con&s;equently that Mo&s;es could not be the writer of the book of Gene&s;is, where this account of pur&s;uing them unto <HI>Dan</HI> is given."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 10&mdash;11.</NOTE> is of no force to invalidate the hi&s;torical and chronological evidence of
<PB N="12" REF="032376_0011_0FF1FFC6B504EBF8">the books a&s;cribed to Mo&s;es, as the author of them; becau&s;e, he did not pretend to write tho&s;e things of his own knowledge, but only as they were dictated to him by the Almighty, to whom all events are known.</P>
<P>As the &s;ame argument equally applies to what you advance concerning the kings of Edom that reigned before any king reigned in I&s;rael: of the manua which the children of I&s;rael eat till they came to the borders Canaan; and con|cerning the bed of Og, &amp;c. it would be only wa&s;ting of time to &s;hew the fallacy of them; as it mu&s;t be vi&s;ible to the meane&s;t capacity. I &s;hall however, take notice of what you advance concerning the &s;lim&s;y pretence of prophecy, as you are plea&s;ed to call it.</P>
<P>You &s;ay,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 16.</NOTE> "the two in&s;tances I have given would be &s;ufficient, without any ad|ditional evidence, to invalidate the authen|ticity of any book that pretended to be four or five hundred years more ancient than the matters it &s;peaks of, or refers to,
<PB N="13" REF="032376_0012_0FF1FFC89825EE38">as facts; for in the ca&s;e <HI>of pur&s;uing them unto Dan,</HI> and of the <HI>kings that reigned over the children of I&s;rael,</HI> not even the flim&s;y pretence of prophecy can be plead|ed. The expre&s;&s;ions are in the preter ten&s;e, and it would be downright idoti&s;m to &s;ay that a man could prohe&s;y in the preter ten&s;e." Here &s;ir, we have a &s;pe|cimen of your profound critici&s;m, and the great knowledge you have of pro|phetic writing: What! attempt to criti|ci&s;e on the Bible, and not know that prophecies are &s;ometimes delivered in the preter ten&s;e! Do you not know, (and if you do not, it is civility to inform you) that the delivery of prophecy in the pre|preter ten&s;e is often made u&s;e of, and which is to &s;hew the truth of it; as if it were already come to pa&s;s? This is well known to all tho&s;e that are in the lea&s;t acquainted with the prophetic writings; numerous in&s;tances of which might be ad|duced, if it was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;idered that Mo&s;es was not prophe&s;ying then; but writing of hi&s;tory, under the guidance of the
<PB N="14" REF="032376_0013_0FF1FFCCE2B767C8">&s;upreme being? he therefore related things as if they were actually come to pa&s;s, being directed by God &s;o to do: and which accounts for all your objec|tions to the hi&s;torical and chronological evidence of the books a&s;cribed to Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>That Mo&s;es wrote tho&s;e books by di|vine in&s;piration, is manife&s;t from the ex|act accompli&s;hment of every event fore|told by him. Of this, I &s;hall produce &s;uch clear and unequivocal proofs, as to &s;trike the Dei&s;t and infidel dumb.</P>
<P>That which I &s;hall principally in&s;i&s;t up|on, is the dreadful denunciations of Mo&s;es relating to our di&s;per&s;ion, wherein he tells us, (Levit. xxvi. 33. and Deut. xxviii. 64.) that we &s;hall be &s;cattered over the face of the whole earth, among all nations: but what is mo&s;t wonderful, he tells us, that we &s;hall neverthele&s;s remain a SEPARATE people, capable of being gathered together in the latter days. This he a&s;&s;ures us of in the following words. <HI>"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not co&s;t them away, neither will I abhor them, to de&s;troy them utterly, and to break
<PB N="15" REF="032376_0014_0FF1FFD0658ED288">my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. xxxvi. 44.</NOTE>. This &s;ir, is corro|borated by the other prophets, (whom you have al&s;o been plea&s;ed to treat with &s;uch contempt) for Jeremiah ob&s;erves (chap. xxx. 11.) "For I am with thee, &s;aith the Lord, to &s;ave thee: though I make a full end of all the nations whi|ther I have di&s;per&s;ed thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will cor|rect<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o chap. xlvi. 28.</NOTE> thee in mea&s;ure; and will not alto|gether con&s;ume thee." And Amos (chap. ix. 8.) &s;ays, "Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the &s;inful kingdom; and I will de&s;troy it from off the face of the earth; yet will I not ut|terly de&s;troy the hou&s;e of Jacob, &s;aith the Lord. For, lo, I will command, and I will &s;ift the hou&s;e of I&s;rael among all nations; as (one that) &s;ifteth (corn) with a &s;ieve: and a grain &s;hall not fall upon the ground." That is, the collect|ive body of the nation &s;hall not be de|&s;troyed; as I &s;hall &s;hew at large in the
<PB N="16" REF="032376_0015_0FF1FFD6C7F8A258">explanation of that prophecy, in my di&s;|&s;ertations on the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament: the &s;econd volume of which, is ju&s;t publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Hence it is manife&s;t, that although Mo&s;es and the other prophets, a&s;&s;ure us that, the nation &s;hould be &s;cattered among all nations, and &s;orely afflicted; yet &s;hould they not be utterly de&s;troyed, as was the ca&s;e of other nations, as we &s;ee it fully verified at this day. And now, &s;ir, give me leave to a&s;k you, how it was po&s;&s;ible for Mo&s;es, without being divinely in&s;pired, to fore&s;ee that, the dreadful puni&s;hments which he had de|nounced again&s;t them, &s;hould be &s;o fully accompli&s;hed, as they are allowed on all hands to be; becau&s;e, a number of ac|cidents might have ari&s;en, to prevent their completion, which no human fore|&s;ight could have fore&s;een? As for in|&s;tance, the greate&s;t part of our &s;ufferings have ari&s;en from the per&s;ecutions which we have &s;uffered from Chri&s;tians, on ac|count of the difference of religion, and the charge brought again&s;t us, of cruci|fying the Lord of life, and Saviour of the
<PB N="17" REF="032376_0016_0FF1FFDA6BE2A650">world. Now, if this had not taken place, it is mo&s;t probable, that we &s;hould not have &s;uffered &s;uch cruel and dreadful per|&s;ecutions, &amp;c. as we have experienced for &s;o many hundred years.</P>
<P>Again, how could he fore&s;ee, but that the nation, after its being driven out of its own country, &s;cattered in all parts, and &s;uffering &s;uch mi&s;ery, might not thereby be induced entirely to abandon Judai&s;m; and &s;o fall in with the religion of the dif|ferent countries, where they were di&s;|per&s;ed: and thus become incorporated with them, and entirely &s;wallowed up among them; as has been the ca&s;e of the greate&s;t monarchies. Indeed, nothing could, or would be more probable: for as to what &s;ome Dei&s;ts (who when driven from one entrenchment, retire into ano|ther, and from that into a third; and all along behave like an adver&s;ary who fights, not with the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, but for the vain glory of not yielding till he can hold out no longer) pretend, that the law he gave them, which contained the prohibi|tion of meats, intermarriages with other
<PB N="18" REF="032376_0017_0FF1FFDF22891080">nations, &amp;c. is the &s;ole cau&s;e of it, is pu|erile, and carries its own confutation with it. Becau&s;e, as I have ob&s;erved, how was he &s;ure, that as well as they fell into ido|latry, and other enormous crimes, they would not violate tho&s;e prohibitory pre|cepts, who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was &s;o much le&s;s heinous; and thus be mingled among the nations: for &s;urely, nothing el&s;e could in all human probability be expected; con&s;idering what they have &s;uffered dur|ing this long and dreadful captivity; for I am free to a&s;&s;ert, no nation ever &s;uffered the like, during a &s;pace of almo&s;t eighteen hundred years. But Mo&s;es, contrary to all human fore&s;ight, informs us, that not|with&s;tanding the &s;evere, and almo&s;t unpa|ralleled cha&s;ti&s;ements that they &s;hould ex|perience, yet, &s;hould they &s;till be pre&s;erv|ed a di&s;tinct nation. How exactly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> hath been fulfilled to this very day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> not be in&s;i&s;ted upon; as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> every eye, and manife&s;t to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> capacity; although a period of upwards of three thou&s;and years hath elap&s;ed &s;ince the delivery of this prophecy. I there|fore would &s;ain a&s;k you, or any other
<PB N="19" REF="032376_0018_0FF1FFE4E5110380">Dei&s;t, Whether it was po&s;&s;ible that Mo&s;es, or any other per&s;on could fore&s;ee &s;uch a wonderful event, by any human means whatever; or how you, or they, can ac|count for it, on any other &s;cheme, than that of divine pre&s;cience?</P>
<P>If we enter into particulars, we &s;hall find, that all the puni&s;hments which he denounced again&s;t them, have been &s;o ex|actly fulfilled in every particular, that it is no wonder, if infidels were to have recour&s;e to the old hackneyed objections, that the facts were prior to the predicti|ons, and that the prophecies were written after the hi&s;tories. If, therefore, the ac|compli&s;hment of the preceding prophecy, which may properly be called, a &s;tanding miracle, even to this very day, the like of which hath never been &s;een or heard of in the world, &s;hould not be able to con|vince you or other unbelievers, how can we expect that any other argument &s;hould, how &s;trong &s;oever? But, as I would not by any means, omit adducing any argument that may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject, or tend to carry conviction home to the doubting and wavering mind,

Now, I defy you, or any one el&s;e, to produce any in&s;tance of a legi&s;ta|tor ever &s;taking his reputation thus; and the exact manner it hath been fulfilled, is clear from their hi&s;tory; for they were indeed plucked off from their own land, when the ten tribes were carried away captive by the king of A&s;&s;yria; and of whom we know nothing certain to this hour; and when the other two tribes were carried captive to Babylon: but more e&s;pecially, when their city and tem|ple were de&s;troyed, and the nation carried captive by the Romans.</P>
<P>From that time to this, their country hath been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of foreign lords and ma&s;ters, few Jews living in it; and tho&s;e of a low and poor condition.

And has not a great ma&s;ter of nature, drawn the portrait of a Jew, in a mo&s;t dete&s;table character, in his Jew of Venice?

In their former captivities, they had the con&s;olation of being together in one place: in Egypt, they dwelt together in the land of Go&s;hen; and they were all carried together to Ba|bylon; but at pre&s;ent they are &s;cattered all over the face of the earth.

<P>La&s;tly, he tells them that they &s;hall be carried into Egypt again, and expo&s;ed to &s;ale as &s;laves, but there would be none to purcha&s;e them.

This, is a &s;triking contra&s;t to what happened to them when Mo&s;es brought them out from Egypt; for then, they came out in a triumphant man|ner, as mentioned Exod. xiv. 8. "And the children of I&s;rael went out with an high hand." But now, he &s;ays, they &s;hall return thither as &s;laves.

According to the account we have in the&s;e books of the fir&s;t calling of Mo&s;es to his mi&s;&s;ion, it does not appear that he was <HI>a vain and arrogant coxcomb;</HI> but on the contrary, it &s;hews him to be a meek and humble per&s;on; one that was fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s he was to engage in; and, there|fore, he &s;ays to God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. iii. 11.</NOTE>, "Who (am) I, that I &s;hould go unto Pharaoh, and that I &s;hould bring forth the children of I&s;rael from Egypt?

This, Sir, is not the behaviour of <HI>an arrogant coxcomb,</HI> nor yet that of <HI>a dete&s;table</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 15.</NOTE> <HI>villain;</HI> but on the contrary, that of a pious, virtuous per&s;on, who tried every means in his power to a|vert the dreadful judgment that hung over Pharaoh and his people for their wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>When he brought the nation forth from Egypt, with what gentlene&s;s did he lead them! even "as a nur&s;ing father, beareth the &s;ucking<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. xi. 12.</NOTE> child." With what patience did he bear their frequent re|proaches and murmurings. But when they were in danger of being de&s;troyed,
<PB N="42" REF="032376_0041_0FF2003A834FFDF0">what public &s;pirit, what love did he &s;hew for his people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Exod xxxii. 32.</NOTE>! How often did he ear|ne&s;tly &s;upplicate the &s;upreme being in their behalf, to &s;ave them from the pu|ni&s;hment they had &s;o ju&s;tly merited for their &s;ins. And when he was fully a&s;&s;ured of his death,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxvii. 13. &amp;c.</NOTE> his only concern was for them; earne&s;tly reque&s;ting God to appoint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to govern them, "that the congregation of the LORD, might not be as &s;heep that have no &s;hephered." And now, give me leave to a&s;k you, whether this action &s;hews him to be an impo&s;tor? for had he a&s;pired to the regal power, no man ever had a better oppor|tunity of accompli&s;hing it. But he ne|ver thought of it: all his actions &s;hew that he acted under the immediate autho|rity of God. He, therefore, &s;aw, with|out murmuring, his brother and his bro|ther's children rai&s;ed to the &s;acerdotal of|fice. And what adds to the lu&s;tre of the action, he him&s;elf puts them in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this dignity, whil&s;t he leaves his own children mixed in the crowd of
<PB N="43" REF="032376_0042_0FF2003EADA86678">Levites, without hopes of ever ri&s;ing to any higher preferment: for by the con&s;ti|tution of the prie&s;thood, they were bar|red from ever having any &s;hare in the honour, power, or wealth of the prie&s;ts, and rendered totally incapable of ever enjoying the authority and dignity of the high prie&s;t's office. The&s;e, Sir, are &s;ome of the actions of Mo&s;es; and they are &s;uch as &s;hew him to have been a per|&s;on of eminent virtue and piety. And, as he was virtuous and pious him&s;elf, &s;o he endeavoured to form a virtuous peo|ple, who, by a faithful &s;ervice paid to the one true God, &s;hould give an exam|ple to all the nations of the earth, of a pure and rea&s;onable wor&s;hip. This Sir, was the &s;ole end of the legi&s;lation of Mo|&s;es, &s;o much &s;uperior to all other forms of government; for as the illu&s;trious author of the Spirit of Laws, &s;ays, "Be&s;ides the common object which all governments have of &s;upporting them&s;elves, each of them has be&s;ides a peculiar one." Thus Sparta formed &s;oldiers, Rome conquerors, and Carthage merchants and navigators; but this object of Mo&s;es, I am bold to af|firm,
<PB N="44" REF="032376_0043_0FF200406B608DA0">was much more noble, and more worthy of a wi&s;e legi&s;lator, than any of tho&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t famous legi&s;lators made it a rule not to change any thing in the ancient &s;uper&s;ti|tions, but to leave the people at full li|berty to pro&s;titute their adoration to infe|rior gods, to the &s;tars, the elements, plants, reptiles, &amp;c. While Mo&s;es con&s;i|dered it as a mo&s;t important obligation, to in&s;truct his nation in its duty towards the great Creator and governor of the world. To make them &s;en&s;ible of his power, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice and providence; and to teach them how to de&s;erve an happy exi&s;tence under his almighty pro|tection, by an exact ob&s;ervance of his laws. Do you not think, Sir, that a con|duct like this, de&s;erves encomiums even in a philo&s;ophical light?</P>
<P>Moreover, what legi&s;lator ever &s;poke of the &s;upreme being to his people, as Mo&s;es did to the Hebrews? he gives them the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas of him, and &s;hews them the mo&s;t manife&s;t proofs of his particular providence, &amp;c. And
<PB N="45" REF="032376_0044_0FF200463888D6E0">which leads me to take notice of an ob|&s;ervation that I have made el&s;where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ertations on the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament. Introd. to Vol. I&s;t. p. 44.</NOTE>, in &s;upport of the truth of the divine di&s;|pen&s;ation of Mo&s;es&mdash;It is as follows.&mdash;The modern philo&s;ophers, &s;uch as Voltaire, &amp;c. take a pride in repre&s;enting the Jews as an ignorant, &s;tupid, and bar|barous nation, compared with the more poli&s;hed nations of antiquity. Let us now for a moment grant the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion, it of cour&s;e will follow that, from a people &s;o ignorant, &s;tupid, and unpoli&s;hed, as they are repre&s;ented to be, we naturally &s;hould not expect to find &s;entiments and doctrines, far &s;uperior to any thing of the kind that we find among the mo&s;t improved nations.</P>
<P>Now, it is well known that the anti|ent, nations the Egyptians, the Babylo|nians, the A&s;&s;yrians, the Tyrians, &amp;c. were the neighbours of the Jews, and com|pletely &s;urrounded them. The&s;e, were all &s;unk into the mo&s;t gro&s;s and &s;tupid idolatry: for they wor&s;hiped not only the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars: which they &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="46" REF="032376_0045_0FF2004A1ED72C10">to be animated, and on who&s;e in|fluence they imagined their good and bad fortunes depended; but death men, heroes, &amp;c. Jupiter, Venus, Adonis, &amp;c. as al&s;o animals, in&s;ects, and even onions. It therefore is requi&s;ite to enquire, how the Jews thus &s;urrounded by the&s;e nati|tions, became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch ju&s;t and &s;ublime conceptions, with re&s;pect to the Deity; and the mo&s;t exalated ideas of his pure UNITY, as inculcated in the writings of Mo&s;es; and where could they have learned &s;uch rational wor&s;hip? A wor&s;hip confined to one invi&s;ible, Omnipo|tent, Omni&s;cient, and Omnipre&s;ent, being; the maker and governor of all things, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, from whom the &s;un; moon, &s;tars, and every thing el&s;e derived their exi&s;tence, and in who&s;e power it is to di&s;po&s;e of them as he plea&s;es. It is clear they could not have learned it from the&s;e nations, nor any other; be|cau&s;e their religion was &s;o e&s;&s;entially different from that of any other nation in the ancient world: for they all, with|out exception, practi&s;ed the mo&s;t impure, as well as the mo&s;t cruel rites in ho|nour

<P>Many of their ceremonies were mo&s;t horribly barbarous.

Innocent children were not &s;pared by their parents, who madly devoted them to the mo&s;t cruel death; that of burning them alive, either to appea&s;e the wrath, or &s;ecure the favour of their gods. A remarkable in&s;tance of which, we have in the life of Themi&s;tocles, the renowned Admiral of the Athenians, as related by Plutarch. "When Themi&s;tocles was about to &s;acrifice upon the Admiral galley, there were three very beautiful captives brought to him, well dre&s;&s;ed and gloriou&s;ly adorned with rich ve&s;ts of gold, &s;aid to be the children of <HI>Autarctus</HI> and <HI>Sandauce,</HI> &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Xerxes.</HI> As &s;oon as the prophet <HI>Euphrantides</HI> &s;aw them, and ob&s;erved that at the &s;ame time the fire blazed out from the offerings, and ca&s;t forth a more than ordinary bright flame, and that one &s;neezed

<P>They al&s;o practi&s;ed many &s;hocking in|dencies, not proper to be recited; wo|men, in other re&s;pects cha&s;te, were taught that pro&s;titution (in which the choice of a partner was not thought of, as being totally excluded) was a nece&s;&s;ary made of recemmending them&s;elves to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and protection of their deities.

Let us now &s;ir, con&s;ider this heinous charge, which with all the abu&s;e that you are ma&s;ter of, you have exhibited again&s;t Mo&s;es: in order to which, we mu&s;t take
<PB N="52" REF="032376_0051_0FF20063153D8000">notice of the cau&s;e of this war; and which we &s;hall find to be not a "plundering and murdering excur&s;ion," but undertaken at the expre&s;s command of God, to avenge the children of I&s;rael of the Midianites, for what they had &s;uffered through their &s;eduction; and al&s;o for God's vengeance again&s;t them, for the crime of idolatry which they had cau&s;ed I&s;rael to commit again&s;t him: for both the&s;e are mentioned in ver. 2 and 3. "Avenge the children of I&s;rael of the Midianites, &amp;c.&mdash;And avenge the Lord of Midian." For by the diabolical &s;cheme of the Midianites pro&s;ti|tuting their women, the children of I&s;|rael, were &s;educed to commit idolatry: for which crime, twenty four thou&s;and of them were cut off. They therefore were commanded to make war upon them: and the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition, plainly &s;hewed, that it was undertaken and conducted under the immediate go|vernment of God: for though the Jewi&s;h army con&s;i&s;ted of but twelve thou&s;and men, yet did they not lo&s;e one &s;ingle man, in fighting again&s;t the ho&s;t of Midian; and which made &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion on the
<PB N="53" REF="032376_0052_0FF20064E501D4C8">minds of the captains of the ho&s;t, (of which you take no manner of notice, though if the one part be true, the other mu&s;t be equally &s;o) that they offered an oblation to the Lord, for his gracious in|terpo&s;ition in their behalf.</P>
<P>When this army returned thus victori|ous, Mo&s;es and the princes of the congre|gation went to out to meet it; and Mo&s;es ob&s;erving the women captives was wroth with the officers; and in a tone of &s;ur|pri&s;e, a&s;ked, "Have ye &s;aved all the wo|men alive?" For the officers of the army were fully convinced that, according to the rules of war, none were to be put to death, but tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed them; and therefore, women and children were ex|cepted; as we find Mo&s;es him&s;elf had laid it down as rule for the nation, when ma|king war again&s;t any other nations, than the Canaanites: Deut. xx. 10. "When thou come&s;t nigh unto a city to fight a|gain&s;t, &amp;c.&mdash;And if it will make no peace with thee, &amp;c.&mdash;Thou &s;halt &s;mite every male thereof with the edge of the &s;word. But the women, and the little ones, and
<PB N="54" REF="032376_0053_0FF200669EC64BC0">the cattle, &amp;c. &s;halt thou take for a &s;poil to thy&s;elf." The officers therefore, flew all the males in Midian, and took the women, and the little ones captive. But Mo&s;es tells them, that here the ca&s;e was far different; for, "Behold, <HI>the&s;e</HI> cau&s;ed the children of I&s;rael, through the coun&s;el of Balaam, to commit tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t the Lord in the matter of Peor," <HI>The&s;e women</HI> were the principal actors in this abominable and attrocious crime; for by their pro&s;tituting them&s;elves, they &s;e|duced I&s;rael, and drew them to the im|pure wor&s;hip of their idol god Baal-peor; "and thus there was a plague among the congregation." It therefore, is but ju&s;|tice, that they &s;hould be puni&s;hed in an exemplary manner; as al&s;o to prevent their ever again alluring the nation to the love of licentious plea&s;ures, and the prac|tice of idolatry. The young males were ordered to be put to death, (as Abarbanal ob&s;erves) to prevent the mi&s;chief that might en&s;ue from their being &s;pared; by becoming as "pricks in their eyes; and thorns in their &s;ides," either by attempt|ing to avenge what they would e&s;teem
<PB N="55" REF="032376_0054_0FF2006C69DD1A20">their country's wrongs, or by leading the nation into idolatry. But the young mai|dens who had done no injury to the na|tion; and being as yet unpolluted with the abominable and atrocious crimes of their mothers, were not likely to injure thein, were permitted to live, to be em|ployed in dome&s;tic u&s;es in their families, or given as wives to their men &s;ervants, as will be &s;hewn hereafter. This is the real &s;tate of the matter. But, you, &s;ir, without any regard to truth or decency, a&s;&s;ert,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 15.</NOTE> that "it appears from the 35th ver&s;e of this chapter, that the number of women-children con&s;igned to debauchery by the order of Mo&s;es, was thirty-two thou&s;and." But whence, &s;ir, does this appear? is it to be found in the words of Mo&s;es? Certainly not. Prove it then, &s;ir, it is incumbent on you to prove it. Prove this, I &s;ay, and I will never more defend Mo&s;es; but will acknowledge him to be that dete&s;table villain and horrid mon&s;ter that you pronounce him to be.

But not a word, did they pre&s;ume to &s;ay, a|bout the order of Mo&s;es for debauching the women children: No &s;ir, they knew better; they knew that they could be ea&s;ily detected in making &s;uch an a&s;&s;er|tion; for they knew that Mo&s;es was &s;o far from ordering any &s;uch thing, that his laws did not even permit it: this is clear from Deut. xxi. 10&mdash;14. where it is or|dered that a man &s;hall not even <HI>marry a captive,</HI> without &s;everal previous formali|ties: and if he afterwards did not like

He was obliged to marry her. See al&s;o Abarbanal on Deut. xxi. 10, &amp;c. This is a manife&s;t proof of the tenderne&s;s with which the laws of Mo&s;es treated pri&s;oners of war: and I am confident that no one can produce any ancient nation, who&s;e government ever treated them with the like tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect.</NOTE> All which, &s;hews the fal&s;ity of what you have advanced &s;o injurious to the character of Mo&s;es; and which mu&s;t now recoil on your own head.</P>

For there is nothing contained in them relating to the time be|fore the deluge, that has any appearance of truth:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid page 27.</NOTE> of this, every di&s;cerning mind will be fully convinced, on comparing the fabulous hi&s;tories of Sanchoniatho, Ma|netho, Bero&s;us,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his fabulous account of the deluge, Univ.

"That there was &s;uch an univer&s;al de&s;truction by water, is confirmed by the concurrent te&s;timonies of &s;everal of the mo&s;t ancient writers and nations in in the world. What account the Chaldean records (meaning the hi&s;tory of Bero&s;us) give of it, we have already &s;een. The Indian and Per&s;ian tradi|tion we may mention hereafter. That the Egypti|ans were no &s;trangers to this event, appears not only from tho&s;e circum&s;tances of O&s;iris and Typhon mentioned above; but al&s;o from the te&s;timony of Plato: who &s;ays, that a certain Egyptian prie&s;t recounted to Solon, out of their &s;acred books, the hi&s;tory of the univer&s;al flood, which happend long before the particular inundations known to the Gre|cians. The inhabitants of Heliopolis, in Syria, &s;hewed a cha&s;m or cleft in the earth in the temple of Juno, which &s;wallowed up the waters of the flood. Nay, the very Americans are &s;aid to acknowledge and &s;peak of it in their continent: and we are told, that there is a tradition among the Chine&s;e, that Po|oncu, with his family e&s;caped the general deluge," &amp;c. Thus we &s;ee that mo&s;t nations have &s;ome idea of a delage, though none have &s;o clear an account of it, as that given by Mo&s;es.</NOTE> Herodotus, and Dio|dorus Siculus, with that of Mo&s;es.</P>

No Sir, it is the wi&s;e philo&s;ophy of a good man, who wi&s;hes to render his fellow crea|tures happy: for Mo&s;es begins his hi&s;to|ry, with informing us, that there is a God, and that he created the world, and all that is therein. This was the grand fundamental principle, to bring men to the knowledge and wor&s;hip of him that made them: for it is manife&s;t to demon|&s;tration, that if man does but give him&s;elf time to reflect, that God made him, and gave him hands to feel, legs to walk, &amp;c. and endowed him with powers and rea|&s;oning faculties, far beyond that of the brute creation; he will naturally love and reverence that great and awful being, that

The know|ledge of this &s;ublime truth, effectually de&s;troys all tho&s;e fal&s;e notions entertain|ed by certain philo&s;ophers, of the eterni|ty of matter, and a fortuitous concour&s;e of Atoms. It lays the axe to the root, and at once annihilates that fooli&s;h, ab|&s;urd, and impious tenet: and which is a demon&s;tration that the philo&s;ophy of Mo&s;es, was mo&s;t beneficially conducive to to the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>

<P>As a poet, his beatiful ode, recorded in <HI>Exodus,</HI> is &s;uperior to any thing of the kind: but his prophetic poem in <HI>Deute|ronomy,</HI> is not to be equalled. It con|tains &s;ix parts, as I have &s;hewn in ano|ther<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to Lingua Sacra, p. 4.</NOTE> place. The fir&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts of the fir&s;t five ver&s;es, and is a prefactory in|troduction to the poem: The &s;econd part contains nine ver&s;es; the &s;ubject of which is the kindne&s;s and beneficence of the Supreme Being towards <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> The third part con&s;i&s;ts of the next four ver&s;es, in which he de&s;cribes the &s;in and wicked|ne&s;s of the nation: The fourth part con|&s;i&s;ts of the next &s;even ver&s;es, in which he recounts the afflictions with which GOD would puni&s;h them for their di&s;obedience: The fifth part contains the next eight

<P>And I cannot forbear ob&s;erving in proof of the prophetic in&s;piration of this poem, that the fir&s;t five parts of it, have been fully accompli&s;hed, viz.

And it is very re|markable, that the prophet Jeremiah hath clearly evinced the truth of this po&s;ition, in the following words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerm. xxxii. 42.</NOTE> which pro|duces as an argument, in &s;upport of what he had delivered as a prophecy, foretell|ing the future re&s;toration of the nation: "For thus &s;aith the Lord, like as I have brought all this great evil upon this peo|ple, &s;o will I bring upon them all the good that I have promi&s;ed them." A &s;tronger proof than what is contained in the&s;e words of the prophet, in &s;upport of the &s;pirit of prophecy, cannot be required; for the accompli&s;hment of the evils pre|dicted, is a &s;ure pledge of the completion of the good promi&s;ed: and therefore, as it is allowed on all hands, that the fir&s;t five parts of this poem, hath been fulfilled in every particular fact, it con&s;equently

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL, now proceed to the other books of Mo&s;es; viz. Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The&s;e, &s;ir, contain our laws, Religions and Moral; Civil, Political, and Ritual; (though I do not mean to treat of them all thus di&s;tinctly arranged; but only of a few of them as they occur to illu&s;trate the &s;ub|ject we are treating of) from all which I hope to prove, to the &s;atisfaction of every candid and liberal mind, that the&s;e laws were every way worthy of God, who was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow them by the hands of his &s;ervant Mo&s;es, on this people I&s;|rael.</P>
<P>There is one God, &s;ays the Penta|teuch, and but One. This God alone de&s;erves to be wor&s;hipped. He is the Supreme Being, the nece&s;&s;ary origin of all beings; no other is comparable to
<PB N="68" REF="032376_0067_0FF2009E84464CA0">him. He is a pure &s;pirit, immen&s;e and infinite; he cannot be repre&s;ented by any bodily &s;hape. It is he that created the univer&s;e by his power, and governs it by his wi&s;dom. He views all our actions; nothing can e&s;cape his watchful eye; and with an equitable hand he rewards and puni&s;hes us according to our de&s;erts.</P>
<P>All this we learn from tho&s;e books; for the belief of the exi&s;tence of God, is founded on the fir&s;t great commandment, <HI>I am the Lord thy God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx. 2. &amp; Deut. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>That he is <HI>One,</HI> we are taught from Deut. vi. 6. <HI>Hear O I&s;rael, the Lord</HI> is <HI>our God, the Lord</HI> is own.</P>
<P>That he alone is to be wor&s;hipped, is contained in the &s;econd and third com|mandments, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me. Thou &s;halt not make unto that any graven image, &amp;c. Thou &s;halt not been down thy&s;elf to them, nor &s;erve them, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That he cannot be repre&s;ented by any bodily &s;hape, we are taught from Deut. iv. 15. <HI>For ye &s;aw no &s;imilitude on the

Again<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 25.</NOTE>, To whom will ye liken me? and to whom &s;hall I be equalled? &s;aith the <HI>holy one.</HI>"</P>
<P>That God knoweth all the thoughts and actions of mankind; and is not &s;o in dif|ferent and unconcerned about them, as the unbelievers think; who &s;ay, "the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;eeth us not; the <HI>Lord</HI> hath for&s;ak|en the earth," (Fzek. viii. 12?) But on the contrary, he ob&s;erves, and takes cog|nizance of all our actions: this we are taught from Gen. vi. 3. "And God &s;ave that the wickedne&s;s of man (was) great in the earth." See al&s;o Gen. xviii. 20, be&s;ides &s;everal other parts of the&s;e books.</P>
<P>That God rewards and puni&s;hes with an equitable hand, we are taught in Exod. xxxii. 32, 33. "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their &s;in: and if not, blot me, I
<PB N="70" REF="032376_0069_0FF200A691417EE8">pray thee, out of thy book which thou ha&s;t written, And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo|&s;es, who&s;oever have &s;inned again&s;t me, him will I blot out of my book."</P>
<P>We are al&s;o taught, that although a temple was commanded to be built; mi|ni&s;ters appointed for its &s;ervice, &s;acrifices and offerings in&s;tituted; yet all this is nothing in his eyes, if the &s;entiments of the heart do not give it life. The wor|&s;hip that he requires above all things, and before every thing, is the acknowledg|ment of our entire dependance on him, and of his &s;upreme dominion; thankful|ne&s;s for his benefits; tru&s;t in his mercy, reverence, and love. Thus he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. v. 6.</NOTE> "And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength.

See al&s;o chap. xi. ver. 13, &amp;c. where the&s;e true and &s;ublime ideas are al&s;o &s;trongly inculcated; and which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h the Jewi&s;h from all ancient legi&s;lators; and plainly &s;hew that the doctrines, which recommend &s;uch a pure wor&s;hip, can be none other than divine; as being every way worthy of God.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the morality taught in the&s;e books, what beauty and purity do we find in this morality! There is &s;carcely a vice which it doth not con|demn. It is not enough that evil actions are forbidden, even de&s;ires are prohibit|ed, "Thou &s;hall not de&s;ire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. v. 21.</NOTE>. Thou &s;halt not covet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx. 17.</NOTE> In inculcating this mo|rality, Mo&s;es not only requires perfect equity, untainted probity, ju&s;tice, faith|fulne&s;s, and the mo&s;t exact hone&s;ty; but he would al&s;o have us be humane, com|pa&s;&s;ionate, and charitable: ever ready to do unto others as we &s;hould wi&s;h they would do unto us, as he &s;ays<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Levit. xix 19.</NOTE>, "But
<PB N="72" REF="032376_0071_0FF200ACDFEA93F8">thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf."</P>
<P>This love is al&s;o to be extended to the &s;tranger; "And if a &s;tranger &s;ojourn with you in your land, ye &s;hall not vex him. But the &s;tranger that dwelleth with you, &s;hall be unto you as one born among&s;t you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf; for ye were &s;trangers in the land of E|gypt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. xix, 33-34</NOTE> Love ye therefore the &s;tranger: for ye were &s;trangers in the land of E|gypt."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. x. 19.</NOTE> Thus you may perceive that this brotherly love and charity was not confined to tho&s;e that were Jews born; as every other per&s;on might &s;hare in them: for it is, and ever was, a fixed law among&s;t us, to admit into our religion and com|monwealth, all tho&s;e that were willing to &s;ubmit to our laws and cu&s;toms; and who after &s;ubmitting to the right of circumci|&s;ion, and performing ablution, were in|corporated among the nation, and became as one of them: for thus the law &s;peaks of the &s;tranger. "Let all his males be circumci&s;ed, and then let him come near and keep it; and he &s;hall be as one that

<P>I &s;hall now take notice of &s;ome of the precepts of the land, which may be pro|perly termed a part of the Political laws of Mo&s;es. With the&s;e, &s;everal Fe&s;tivals, (which are a part of the Ritual law) are clo&s;ely connected: and therefore, it is proper to con&s;ider them conjointly.

And that this might be fully ac|compli&s;hed, God promi&s;ed Abraham the land of Canaan for an inheritance for his po&s;terity: though before that time &s;hould arrive, they would be &s;orely afflicted in captivity; from which however, he would redeem them; and &s;everely puni&s;h their oppre&s;&s;ors; and thus make them fully &s;en&s;ible, that he alone was God; and governed the world by his particular pro|vidence. And, as Egypt might ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the very &s;ink of fal&s;e wor|&s;hip; the contaminated fountain, whence flowed idolatry, the arts of magic and divination; and the in&s;titutions of &s;uper|&s;titions and ob&s;cene rites; God was plea&s;ed to make it the &s;cene of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>Now the mo&s;t rational method that could have been taken to reclaim all tho&s;e from their errors, and induce them to em|brace the truth, was to make it appear plain and evident to their under&s;tandings, that things were, in fact, otherwi&s;e than they apprehended. For the Egyptians fal&s;ely imagined that tho&s;e illu&s;trious hea|venly bodies, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, as al&s;o the elements, were the di&s;tributors of ble&s;&s;ings and comforts: for as they ob|&s;erved the cour&s;e of things to be con&s;tant|ly regulated, and the ble&s;&s;ings of life to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and a|gency

This being the ca&s;e, let us now con&s;ider how their fatal mi&s;take was to be removed, and they &s;et right in this point:&mdash;Was it not by convincing them that the&s;e bodies had no other powers or qualities than what they derived from their great Crea|tor, who&s;e in&s;truments they were, em|ployed by him to carry on the purpo&s;es of his providence? And what more ra|tional method could God have made u&s;e of to form this conviction, than that of empowering his me&s;&s;enger to alter or &s;u&s;|pend the qualities of the&s;e bodies, and make them operate by his bare command, in direct oppo&s;ition to their ordinary cour&s;e? This was appealing to their own notions, and making them &s;en&s;ible, in their own way, that the Lord alone was the creator and governor of the world, and that all vi&s;ible beings were but &s;o ma|ny &s;ubordinate agents, working by his power, and under his directions: and who&s;e powers he can &s;u&s;pend whenever he plea&s;es: con&s;equently, he alone was

<P>That we may place this matter in a clear light, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a parti|cular view of the progre&s;s and conduct of the whole proceeding.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, God, by a me&s;&s;age in his own name, required the Egyptian king to relea&s;e his people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. v. 1.</NOTE>. "Thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, let my people go that they may hold a fea&s;t unto me in the wilderne&s;s."

<P><PB N="95" REF="032376_0094_0FF201060901AA00">
But this miracle making no impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Pharaoh, God proceeded by other miracles to &s;hew his omnipotent power, in oppo&s;ition to their fal&s;e deities; by a&s;&s;licting them with ten plagues; and which were wrought in the four elements; as well as in the heavenly bodies: for as Abarbanal ob&s;erves, &s;ome were tran&s;act|ed in gro&s;&s;er elements of earth and water; as the turning the waters into blood, and the plague of frogs: both the&s;e were in the element of water.

<P>This, Sir, was an e&s;pecial proof of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es; and indeed, a greater cannot be required, as Mo&s;es him&s;elf emphatically expre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 32-33.</NOTE> it; "For a&s;k now of the days that are pa&s;t, which were before thee, &s;ince the day that God created man upon the earth, and (a&s;k) from one end of the heaven unto the other, whether there hath been (any &s;uch thing) as this great thing (is), or hath been heard like it?

<P>And as it was by &s;uch extraordinary means that they were brought to a firm belief in the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es, &s;o hath it <HI>never</HI> been effaced from the Jew|i&s;h nation: for notwith&s;tanding that they fell into idolatry, and other crimes; yet at no time whatever, did the nation <HI>de|ny</HI> the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es, or ab|rogate his laws. No, Sir: not the de|&s;truction of our government, and the con&s;equent di&s;per&s;ion of the nation; the per&s;ecutions of Heathens and Chri&s;tians, and the almo&s;t univer&s;al contempt of all nations, have ever been able to root it out of our hearts.

<P>Compare this, now &s;ir, with the extra|ordinary method that the great Lycur|gus took to render his laws immortal, and to cau&s;e them to be delivered down unchangeable to po&s;terity. "To bring this to pa&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch's life of Lycurgus</NOTE>, he called an extraordinary a&s;&s;embly of all the People, he told them that he now thought every thing rea&s;on|ably well e&s;tabli&s;hed, both for the pub|lic happine&s;s, and improving the virtue of each particular; but that there was one thing &s;till behind, and that of the greate&s;t importance, which he thought not fit to impart until he had con&s;ulted the oracle: In the mean time his de&s;ire was, that they would punctually ob&s;erve his laws without any the lea&s;t alteration until his <HI>return</HI> from <HI>Delphi,</HI> and then he would
<PB N="106" REF="032376_0105_0FF20125D3059D18">do as the God &s;hould' direct him. They all con&s;ented readily, and prayed him to ha&s;ten his voyage; but before he depart|ed he admini&s;tered an oath to the two kings, the Senate, and then to all the com|mons, that they would inviolably ob&s;erve his ordinances during his ab&s;ence. This done, he &s;et fail for <HI>Delphi:</HI> when he came to the oracle, and had &s;acrificed to <HI>Apollo,</HI> he a&s;ked him, <HI>whether the law he had e&s;tabli&s;hed were &s;ufficient to make a City virtuous and happy?</HI> The Oracle an&s;wered, <HI>That this laws were excellent, and that the City &s;hould continue in the highe&s;t renown while it ob&s;erved the polity of</HI> Lycurgus. He took this oracle in writing, and &s;ent it over to <HI>Sparta:</HI> and then, having &s;acrificed the &s;econd time to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and taken his leave of his friends, and his &s;on, he re&s;olved that the <HI>Spar|tans</HI> &s;hould never be relea&s;ed from the Oath they had taken, but that there he would put a voluntary end to his life. He therefore made an end of him&s;elf by a total ab&s;tience from meat." But not|with&s;tanding all this, in about five centu|ries; it was all forgotten; and it mo&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="032376_0106_0FF20129536C7D08">certainly would not have continued &s;o long; but (as M. Dacier ob&s;erves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his notes on Plutarch's life of Lycurgus.</NOTE>;) that the Spartans for a long time, had no wars but in Peloponne&s;us. But as &s;oon as their thir&s;t of Empire had in&s;pired them with a de&s;ign of having naval forces, and en|tertaining foreign Troops; and there was a nece&s;&s;ity of foreign money to pay them; then their oath availed no more again&s;t that nece&s;&s;ity, than if it had been a &s;pider's web; they did not &s;o much as remember any &s;uch had ever been taken. Then were the laws of Lycurgus violat|ed with a vengeance, and they were no more thought of than if they had never been.</P>
<P>And now Sir, give me leave to a&s;k you on what principles of philo&s;ophy, can you account for this great di&s;parity between the duration and perpetuity of the laws of Mo&s;es, and tho&s;e of Lycurgus: for, this <HI>duration,</HI> this <HI>perpetuity</HI> of our laws, with the re&s;pect and veneration with which they have been treated for &s;o many ages, and in &s;o many climates, cannot be the
<PB N="108" REF="032376_0107_0FF2012CD3143378">effect of chance. And can you account for it by any natural means? No &s;ir: it is impo&s;&s;ible! The only &s;olution is, that the one was the work of man; con&s;e|quently fallible; and liable to be annul|led. But the other, is the work of God, and, therefore, not &s;ubject to <HI>abolition;</HI> for as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, "Various are the imaginations in the heart of man: but it is the coun&s;el of the Lord alone that &s;hall &s;tand. The coun&s;el of the Lord &s;hall &s;tand for ever: (and) the purpo&s;es of his heart to all generations."

Secondly, it clearly proves, that this law could be none other than a divine or|dinance; for on the&s;e fe&s;tivals <HI>all the males</HI> were commanded to come up from all parts to Jeru&s;alem (as above mention|ed.)

<P>But the greate&s;t proof of a divine pro|vidence was inculcated by the law, that ordained the ob&s;ervance of the Sabbati|cal year, and year of Jubilee. On the&s;e years, there was to be a total ce&s;&s;ation

<P>Now, if con&s;idered in this light, the extirpation of tho&s;e nations, mu&s;t appear to be no more than a ju&s;t vi&s;itation of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, for their atrocious wickedne&s;s.

<P>But if they were willing to make peace I&s;rael was obliged to make peace with either of them: whether tho&s;e that were far off; or tho&s;e that were near; all were equal in this particular. And there|fore our <HI>rabbins</HI> &s;ay, that upon Jo&s;hua's entering the land of promi&s;e, he publi&s;hed three proclamations; fir&s;t, "that tho&s;e inclined to make peace, &s;hould have peace granted to them. Second, tho&s;e that in|tended to war, &s;hould have war. And third, tho&s;e that wi&s;hed to depart, might freely depart." Hence it is manife&s;t that they were obliged to offer them peace: and which is plain, from Jo&s;h. xi. 19-20. "There was not a city which made peace with the children of I&s;rael, &s;ave the Hi|vites, the inhabitants of Gibeon: all <HI>other</HI> they took in battle. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts that they &s;hould come again&s;t I&s;rael in battle, that he might de&s;troy them utterly, <HI>and</HI> that
<PB N="143" REF="032376_0142_0FF201AF5BD2CD80">they might have no favor, but that he might de&s;troy them, as the Lord com|manded Mo&s;es." And which, plainly implies, that if they had not been &s;o ob|&s;tinate, as to engage in a war with the I&s;raelites, and to appear in arms again&s;t them, but had repented, and &s;ubmitted their propo&s;als, they would have been &s;aved, in&s;tead of being put to death; con&s;i&s;tent with the divine command con|cerning their exci&s;ion. If therefore the Canaanites met with de&s;truction from the victorious &s;word of the I&s;raelites, they had none but them&s;elves to blame. By complying with the rea&s;onable terms of|fered to them, it was in their power to prevent it.</P>
<P>I am, however, aware that the ca&s;e of the Gibeonites may be urged as an excep|tion to the po&s;ition here laid down: as we find the I&s;raelites expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves in the following terms to them, "Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how &s;hall we make a league with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. ix. 7</NOTE> you?" By which, it would appear at fir&s;t view,
<PB N="144" REF="032376_0143_0FF201B626803F38">that they could not make peace with any of tho&s;e nations: but this objection will in&s;tantly vani&s;h, when the exact meaning of the words made u&s;e of, by the Gibeon|ites, is clearly under&s;tood: for they did not &s;imply a&s;k for peace, but &s;aid, "now therefore make ye a league with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. 6.</NOTE> us." That is, as the I&s;raclites under&s;tood it, to treat them as confederates, as allies; to admit them to a league of equal right and privilege, &s;uch as one independent &s;tate enters into with another. And which the I&s;raelites could by no means comply with; becau&s;e they were &s;o often commanded not to make 2 covenant with them, le&s;t it &s;hould be a &s;nare to them; (&s;ee Exod. xxiii. 34. xxxiv. 12&mdash;15. &amp; Deut. vii. 2.) they therefore &s;aid, how can I make a league with you, &s;eeing it is &s;o &s;trictly forbidden to make a covenant with any of the&s;e nations; although we are per|mitted to let them live, on their a&s;king for peace, and, &s;ubmitting to the conditions annexed thereto: viz. the renouncing all idol wor&s;hip and becoming tributary.
<PB N="145" REF="032376_0144_0FF201BF2EF93138">This is manife&s;t from the manner in which they behaved to the Gibeonites, when they found that they were of the &s;even nations; for otherwi&s;e, no oath could have been binding on the I&s;raelites, (much le&s;s one obtained by fraud) to oblige them to violate the command of God, in &s;uffer|ing tho&s;e to live that he had doomed to die.

If then, he had written the whole book, it would al&s;o have been mentioned; I, there|fore, am of opinion, with the learned Abarbanal (See his preface to Jo&s;hua), that the prophet Samuel wrote the books of Jo&s;hua (except the part which Jo&s;hua wrote him&s;elf), Judges, Ruth, and a part of the book that bears his name; and which was fini&s;hed by Nathan the prophet, and Gad the &s;eer (as mentioned 1 Chron. xxix. 29.); but all this does not deduct from their authenticity, or invali|date their authority in the lea&s;t: as even on this &s;cheme they were written by the prophets; and are very properly called the word of God, from the words above quoted; where what Jo&s;hua wrote, is &s;aid to be written in the law of God: and al&s;o becau&s;e they direct us to the true wor&s;hip of God, by clearly pointing out to us the merciful dealings of God to|wards I&s;rael; and which is the great end

<P>You &s;ay, "as a poetical figure, the whole is well enough;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 20.</NOTE> but although there are &s;ome commentators who may view it in this light; and that perhaps for the rea&s;on alledged by a certain Chri&s;tian writer, who &s;ays, "but becau&s;e there &s;eems, to my apprehen&s;ion at lea&s;t, no &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on for &s;uch &s;upernatural appear|ance in this in&s;tance:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Wakefield's reply to the &s;econd part of the Age of Rea&s;on, p. 27&mdash;28.</NOTE> But if duly con|&s;idered, it will appear that it was extreme|ly nece&s;&s;ary, at this juncture, as being highly conducive in promoting the grand de&s;ign; I mean, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the true religion, and the extirpation of Idol|atry: and in which light, we mu&s;t al&s;o view the dividing of the river Jordan, and the ca&s;ting of hail &s;tones from heaven upon the Canaanites, &amp;c. ina&s;much as they all tended to fill the nations with

The &s;un and moon &s;tanding &s;till in <HI>their</HI> habitation, requires no explana|tion: the arrows and glittering &s;pear, de|note the in&s;truments of de&s;truction which God employed; the great hail &s;tones; and which may be metaphorically called his arrows and &s;pear; and by who&s;e light the I&s;raelites walked: thus did God, in wrath and indignation, on account of the great and abominable wickedne&s;s of the Canaanites, march through the land, and cru&s;hed them, as corn is by the drag; and which was, when he went forth for the &s;alvation of his people. Thus we &s;ee the prophet de&s;cribing in &s;ublime figurative language, all the mira|cles performed in the conque&s;t of Canaan; among&s;t which none is &s;o plain and clear as this of the &s;un and moon &s;tanding &s;till; and which is an evident proof of the truth thereof: e&s;pecially,
<PB N="156" REF="032376_0155_0FF201E475806D28">when it is con&s;idered, that the &s;ubject of the prophet's prayer was for the pre&s;er|vation of the nation in this captivity, which God informed him of upwards of &s;ix hundred years before it took place.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another proof of the re|ality of this miracle; which is the appeal that the author of the book of Jo&s;hua makes to the book of <HI>Ja&s;her,</HI> as a te&s;ti|mony of the fact which he was then re|cording, "Is not this written in the book of Ja&s;her?" Hence it is manife&s;t, that the book commonly called the book of Ja&s;her, exi&s;ted, and was well known at the time the book of Jo&s;hua was written: and pray, &s;ir, what book do you think this was? Why, none other than the law of Mo&s;es. I &s;ee you are &s;urpri&s;ed; but hold, &s;ir, I will pre&s;ently explain this to you. The word in the Hebrew (with which, I judge, you are totally un|acquainted, though &s;o highly requi&s;ite in the ta&s;k you have undertaken), is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Haya&s;har;</HI> and which, according to the rules of Hebrew grammar, is a noun &s;ub|&s;tantive common, and not a noun &s;ub&s;tan|tive proper; as, in the latter ca&s;e, the

Has not this been pre|dicted in that righteous book? Yes, mo&s;t certainly. But, perhaps you may a&s;k, where? Be patient, and I will tell you. When Mo&s;es was ble&s;&s;ing I&s;rael before his death, he told them of the happine&s;s they were to enjoy in the land, and that they &s;hould atchieve the conque&s;t thereof by the e&s;pecial miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the God of I&s;rael; he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxiii. 26.</NOTE>, "There is none like unto the God of Je&s;hurun, who rideth upon

By this &s;ublime figurative language, the prophet foretold the de&s;truction of their enemies in the land of Canaan; and which &s;hould be, by the power of him who rideth above the heavens: who guideth all by his om|nipotent power: the mover of the hea|vens: who only is able to &s;top the hea|venly luminaries in their cour&s;e, "till the people had avenged them&s;elves of their enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. x. 13.</NOTE> Agreeable to what is here written, "And &s;hall &s;ay, de&s;troy <HI>them.</HI>" And the con&s;equence of this will be, that "I&s;rael &s;hall then dwell in &s;afety alone, <HI>according to</HI> the form <HI>of the ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of Ja|cob, &dagger; on a land of corn and wine, al|&s;o his heaven &s;hall drop dew."</P>

In the conque&s;t of Canaan, it may well be &s;aid, that the Lord was the &s;hield of their help, and the &s;word of their excellency. The Gibeon|ites, a part of their enemies, were found liars to them, by pretending that they came from a far country, when they dwelt in the land: and the treading on their high places, denoted the da&s;truction of the five kings in this battle, on who&s;e necks Jo&s;hua commanded his captains to tread, as is &s;aid,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. x. 24&mdash;25.</NOTE> "Jo&s;hua called for all the men of I&s;rael, and &s;aid unto the cap|tains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of the&s;e kings: for thus &s;hall the Lord do to all your enemies again&s;t whom ye fight."

<P>Thus is the reality of this miracle not only confirmed, but the prediction of Mo|&s;es, is al&s;o fully verified; and the exi&s;t|ence of the law of Mo&s;es at that time, clearly preved: as it would have been madne&s;s in the author, to have appealed in proof of his veracity, to a book that never yet had exi&s;tence, or that was not well known in the nation, as an authentic book.</P>
<P>The end of the other three books, viz. Judges, Samuel, and Kings is al&s;o to in|form us of the particular providence of God; by &s;hewing, that in the days of the Judges, as well as tho&s;e of the kings, the nation was exceedingly wicked; for|&s;aking the true wor&s;hip of God, and com|mitting idolatry, &amp;c. for which they were delivered into the hands of their enemies; but when they &s;incerely repented, and
<PB N="161" REF="032376_0160_0FF201F6D7A2EB28">returned to God, their enemies fell be|fore them; and they enjoyed the greate&s;t pro&s;perity and happine&s;s that po&s;&s;ibly could be; as in the reigns of David and Solomon: all which, was a manife&s;t proof of the &s;uperintendance of divine provi|dence, and of the truth of what Mo&s;es had told them, concerning the reward and puni&s;hment, which they were to expect in ca&s;e of obedience or di&s;obedience: and which was fully accompli&s;hed in every particular; till that, for the great wick|edne&s;s of the nation, and their kings, they were de&s;troyed from off the goodly land, as Jo&s;hua had al&s;o told them; and as is recorded in tho&s;e books: and which is a demon&s;trable proof of their authority.</P>
<P>As to the difference between the books of Kings and Chronicles, I mu&s;t tell you, that they have been noticed by &s;everal Hebrew commentators, and clearly ac|counted for by that great luminary, the learned Abarbanal, as he has &s;hewn, that there is nothing contradictory in the dif|ferent books, but that each writer, had a different purpo&s;e in view; and which ea&s;i|ly
<PB N="162" REF="032376_0161_0FF201F88F10AC98">accounts for the omi&s;&s;ions in one book, though related in the other: but as it would &s;well the&s;e letters, (which already exceed the limits I fir&s;t intended) to the bulk of a large volume, I mu&s;t omit en|tering into the explanation at pre&s;ent, and re&s;erve it for my commentary on the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed extend the&s;e letters to a length trouble&s;ome to my&s;elf, and tire&s;ome to the reader, were I minutely to an&s;wer every objection you have made, and to rectify the numberle&s;s errors into which you have fallen: I therefore did not in|tend to have &s;aid any more on the &s;ubject of the&s;e four books; but the ridicule you have made u&s;e of in a note, on the &s;tory of the angel appearing to Jo&s;hua, de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t reprehen&s;ions; for that being &s;o ignorant of &s;acred literature, you &s;hould thus profanely je&s;t, with what you do not in the lea&s;t under&s;tand, as I &s;hall plainly &s;hew.</P>
<P>That per&s;on, whoever he be, that at|tempts to critici&s;e on &s;cripture, ought not only to have a great knowledge of the Hebrew, but al&s;o a thorough acquaint|ance
<PB N="163" REF="032376_0162_0FF201FA5BDF4100">with the <HI>idiom</HI> and <HI>phra&s;eology</HI> of the &s;acred language, &s;o different from all others: or he will certainly fail in the at|tempt, and render him&s;elf ridiculous in the eyes of every di&s;cerning per&s;on, and ju&s;tly merit their contempt. Of the truth of this ob&s;ervation, there cannot be a greater, than will appear in the explana|tion of the &s;ubject in que&s;tion. Before I proceed to the explanation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enquire why Jo&s;hua, who was the com|mander in chief, as well as the ruler of the nation, when he &s;aw a man, for the text does not &s;ay an angel, at a di&s;tance, &s;hould go up to him him&s;elf, and a&s;k him, <HI>art</HI> thou for us, or for our adver&s;aries? as this ought to have been done by &s;ome of the troops, who ought to have gone and &s;eized him and brought him to Jo&s;hua, and not Jo&s;hua have gone to him, as it might perhaps have been his intention, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the commander in chief; it therefore is &s;omething uncommon, that Jo&s;hua, who was ninety three years old, &s;hould thus expo&s;e him&s;elf to danger. But the &s;olution of this is, that as the text &s;ays, "And it came to pa&s;s when Jo&s;hua was by
<PB N="164" REF="032376_0163_0FF202008BB2FAD8">Jericho,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. v. 13.</NOTE> that is, he was con&s;idering, how and by what means he &s;hould take Jericho, as it was &s;o &s;trongly fortified; "he lift up his eyes, and looked, and be|hold there &s;tood a man over again&s;t him," by the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>oppo&s;ite him,</HI> we are to under&s;tand that the man was <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> to Jo&s;hua only<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thus Daniel &s;ays, "And I Daniel alone &s;aw the vi&s;ion: for the men that were with me &s;aw not the vi&s;ion."

Ha&s;t thou thy &s;word drawn to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, or to afflict us in favour of the enemy? To which he an&s;wered, "Nay, but as cap|tain of the ho&s;t of the Lord am I now come." Think not, Jo&s;hua, that you are the captain of the Lord's ho&s;t (i. e. I&s;rael) in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore do&s;t challenge, me, whether I am for you or

<PB N="200" REF="032376_0199_0FF202D1EF22D948">Per&s;ia in the time of Cyrus, and in which he probably was educated, that there are two &s;upreme, co-eternal, and independent cau&s;es, always acting in oppo&s;ition to each other; one they called Light, who was the author of all good; the other they called Darkne&s;s, the author of all evil; that when the good being Light had the a&s;cendancy, then good and hap|pine&s;s prevailed among men; and when Darkne&s;s had the &s;uperiority, then evil and mi&s;ery abounded. In reference, therefore, to this ab&s;urd opinion, held by the per&s;on (Cyrus) to whom this prophe|cy is addre&s;&s;ed, God by his prophet, in the mo&s;t &s;ignificant terms, a&s;&s;erts his om|nipotence and &s;upremacy: "I am the Lord, and none el&s;e; <HI>Who</HI> formeth the light and createth darkne&s;s; <HI>who</HI> maketh peace and createth evil: I Jehovah am the author of all the&s;e things."

For though when they came up &s;eparately again&s;t Judah, God &s;uffered them as the in&s;truments of his vengeance, for their manifold &s;ins, to prevail again&s;t them: yet, when that un-natural confederacy of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with the <HI>uncircumci&s;ed</HI> was formed; and they plan|ned the total de&s;truction of the royal hou&s;e of David, God would by no means &s;uffer it: they con&s;equently could not prevail again&s;t it.

No. On the con|trary, the two confederate kings were both cut off, before the child that was to be born, knew to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good, exactly as the prophet had predicted.

<P>You next bring forward an objection, which you have borrowed from Spinoza and others, concerning the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the book: but this does not affect the authenticity, nor the genuinene&s;s of the book of Jeremiah: for although the order of time may not be every where ob|&s;erved; yet may it be accounted for, in &s;uppo&s;ing that Ezza, or the men of the great &s;ynagogue, having found all the prophecies of Jeremiah &s;eparately, they collected them together into one book, without attending &s;trictly to the order of their proper places: and yet this may not have been the effect of chance, but of &s;ome cau&s;e known to the prophet and them, though unknown to us; as the learned Abarbanal has ob&s;erved on the xxxvth chapter, which contains a prophe|cy expre&s;sly &s;aid to be delivered in the
<PB N="209" REF="032376_0208_0FF202A214E2CD40">days of <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI> and yet is placed after &s;everal that were delivered in the days of <HI>Zedekiah:</HI> but the rea&s;on of this, appears to be as follows. When Jeremiah had written the preceding prophecy, concern|ing their not &s;uffering the bond-men and bond-women to go free according to the law of Mo&s;es,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxi. 2. Levit. xxv. 39. &amp;c.</NOTE> and for which he denoun|ced a &s;evere &s;entence again&s;t them; he thought proper to place immediately after it, the prophecy concerning the Recha|bites, who &s;trictly obeyed their father's injunction: and when he made trial of their obedience, and offered them wine to drink, they refu&s;ed it; alledging the ex|pre&s;s prohibition of their father. By which, the prophet had an opportunity of placing the di&s;obedience of the Jews to the divine command, in a much &s;tronger point of view; by contra&s;ting it with the obe|dience that the Rechabites paid to their father's command; and as is plain from the words of the prophet, ver. 13, 14, 15.

<P>You ob&s;erve (p. 51) "But the in&s;tance in the la&s;t chapter (the lii.) is &s;till more glaring;" becau&s;e it contains an account of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, which had been already mentioned; but this objection is &s;o futile, that I &s;hould not have taken notice of it, were it not to ex|po&s;e its ab&s;urdity; and to let your admir|ers &s;ee what a profound critic you are in &s;acred literature; for it is univer&s;ally al|lowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sec Abarbanal, &amp;c.</NOTE> to have been added by &s;ome one after Jeremiah's time, probably by Ezra and the men of the great &s;ynagogue, who revi&s;ed the &s;acred writings, and collected them into one body; as is plain from the text. <HI>Thus far</HI> (are) <HI>the words of Jere|miah.</HI> And which was, to di&s;tingui&s;h the preceding prophecies from what follows: which is nearly the &s;ame word for word, as it is recorded in the &s;econd book of Kings, chap. xxiv. 18&mdash;20, and ch. xxv.

<P>I now proceed to take notice of a mat|ter of greater importance; namely, your charge again&s;t Jeremiah for his duplicity. That we may have a clear view of the force of your objection, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that Jeremiah, on account of his having publicly predicted the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, had been ca&s;t by the prin|ces of Judah, who &s;ought his life, into a miry dungeon, as above &s;hewn; and where he certainly would have peri&s;hed, had not Ebed-melech taken compa&s;&s;ion on him, and &s;poken to the king in his fa|vour, &s;aying, "My lord, the king, the&s;e men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cau&s;ed to be thrown into the dungeon: and he is like to die for hun|ger in the place where he is." On this repre&s;entation, the king ordered Jeremiah to be taken out of the dungeon; and,
<PB N="214" REF="032376_0213_0FF202B5DEB217E0">&s;hortly after, &s;ent for him privately (See ver&s;e 14.), and de&s;ired him to conceal nothing from him; at the &s;ame time binding him&s;elf by an oath, that, what|ever the nature of his prophecy might be, he would not put him to death, nor de|liver him into the hands of tho&s;e men (the princes) that &s;ought his life. Jeremiah then &s;hewed him God's purpo&s;e re&s;pect|ing the fate of Jeru&s;alem. When the conference was ended, the king, mindful of his oath to pre&s;erve the life of the prophet, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, &s;aying, "Let no man know of the&s;e words, and thou &s;halt not die. But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come un|to thee, and &s;ay unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou ha&s;t &s;aid unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; al&s;o what the king &s;aid unto thee: then &s;halt thou &s;ay unto them, I pre&s;ented my &s;upplication before the king, that he would not cau&s;e me to re|turn to Jonathan's hou&s;e to die there. Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and a&s;ked him, and he told them accord|ing to all the&s;e words that the king had
<PB N="215" REF="032376_0214_0FF202B9628163A8">commanded." On this, you ob&s;erve (p. 52) "Thus, this man of God, as he is called, could tell a lie, or very &s;trongly prevaricate,&mdash;for certainly he did not go to Zedekiah to make his &s;upplica|tion; neither did he make it." But you certainly mi&s;take, &s;ir; it is not &s;aid that he went to make his &s;upplication, but that he pre&s;ented it. And as it is men|tioned in the preceding chapter, that, in the conference with the king, he did make &s;upplication to him, it is very probable that in this conference he renewed it: e&s;pecially as we find that he continued in the court of the pri&s;on: but be this as it may, I contend that Jeremiah did not <HI>prevaricate</HI> nor tell a <HI>lie</HI> on this occa&s;ion: he acted as every hone&s;t, prudent man would have done in his &s;ituation. He knew the&s;e men were his enemies, and &s;ought his life; he, therefore, was un|der no obligation to tell the whole matter to &s;uch men; he told them the truth in part, to &s;ave his life; and that was &s;uffi|cient. Moreover the king had command|ed him what he &s;hould &s;ay, and particu|larly charged him to let no man know
<PB N="216" REF="032376_0215_0FF202BB27BBE3E8">what had pa&s;&s;ed between them: he, there|fore, as an obedient and dutiful &s;ubject, thought it his bounden duty to do as the king had commanded him: if he had not you would have accu&s;ed him of betraying the king's confidence; e&s;pecially as you have already affixed a &s;u&s;picion on him of his being a traitor.</P>
<P>But your next charge is of a &s;till more &s;erious nature, for you accu&s;e Jeremiah of delivering fal&s;e predictions. "In the xxxivth chapter" you &s;ay, (p. 53) "is a prophecy of Jeremiah to Zedekiah in the&s;e words," ver. 2.&mdash;'Thus &s;aith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will burn it with fire: and thou &s;halt not e&s;cape out of his hand, but thou &s;halt &s;urely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes &s;hall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he &s;hall &s;peak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou &s;halt go to Babylon. <HI>Yet hear the word of the</HI> Lord, <HI>O Zedekiah, king of Judah, thus &s;aith the</HI> Lord, <HI>thou &s;halt not die by the &s;word, but thou &s;halt die in peace; and with the burn|ings of thy fathers, the former kings that

<P>"Now, in&s;tead of Zedekiah behold|ing the eyes of the king of Babylon, and &s;peaking with him mouth to mouth, and dying in peace, and with the burning of odours, as at the funeral of his fathers (as Jeremiah hath declared the Lord him|&s;elf had pronounced), the rever&s;e, ac|cording to the lii. chapter, was the ca&s;e: it is there &s;aid, ver. 10.

<P>THE HISTORY.</P>
<P>"Came Nebuza|radan, captain of the guard, into Jeru&s;a|lem, and he burnt the hou&s;e of the Lord, and the king's hou&s;e, and all the hou&s;es of Jeru&s;alem, and all the hou&s;es of the great <HI>men</HI> burnt he with fire. But the army of the Chal|deans pur&s;ued after the king, and over|took Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was &s;cattered from him. Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; where he gave judg|ment upon him. And the king of Baby|lon &s;lew the &s;ons of

Ch. lii. 8&mdash;13.2 King. xxv. 5&mdash;9. See al&s;o 2 Chron. xxxvi. 19.</P>
<P>Hence it is manife&s;t, that Zedekiah did &s;ee the eyes of the king of Babylon, when he &s;lew the &s;ons of Zedekiah before his eyes; and &s;pake judgments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the literal &s;ea&s;e of the Hebrew.</NOTE> with him: that is, he upbraided him with the perfidy of his revolt again&s;t him; as he had &s;worn by God to him (See 2 Chron. xxxvi. 13.): for which he put out his eyes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The prophecy of Ezekiel concerning Zede|kiah, is very remarkable: (Chap. xii. 13.) "And I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet &s;hall he not &s;ee it, though he &s;hall die there." How exactly was this accompli&s;hed, when the king of Babylon put out his eyes, and then brought him to Babylon! So that though he died there, yet he did not &s;ee it.</NOTE> and carried him to Baby|lon,
<PB N="220" REF="032376_0219_0FF202CAC8039320">where he died in peace, as the pro|phet had predicted.

And now, &s;ir, what can we &s;ay of tho&s;e who call Jeremiah a liar and impo&s;tor, but that they are ba&s;e calum|niators?</P>
<P>You al&s;o a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 53.</NOTE>, that Jeremiah joined him&s;elf afterwards to Nebuchadnezzar, and went about prophe&s;ying for him a|gain&s;t the Egyptians; Thus much for another of the&s;e lying prophets. But where did you find this? Surely not in the narrative that we have of the&s;e tran&s;|actions: for there it is &s;aid, "And the captain of the guards took Jeremiah, and &s;aid unto him, the Lord thy God hath
<PB N="221" REF="032376_0220_0FF1D5CACB540640">denounced this calamity again&s;t this place (no &s;mall compliment to the truth of the prophet's predictions). If it &s;eem good unto thee to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will &s;et mine eyes upon thee." But he declined accepting this kind and friendly offer of Nebuzaradan; and with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and true patrioti&s;m, (which perhaps you would have admired in any other man but a prophet) he re|turned to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren, and when they were determined to go down to Egypt, he endeavoured to prevent them: telling them, according to the word of the Lord, that if they went thi|ther, the &s;word of which they were a|fraid &s;hould overtake, them there in the land of Egypt, and they &s;hould die there: becau&s;e they di&s;&s;embled when they &s;ent him to enquire for them of God, "&s;ay|ing, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and according to all that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;ay, &s;o declare unto us, and we will do.

<P>You &s;ay (p. 54.) "In the former part of the Age of Rea&s;on, I have &s;aid that the word prophet was the Bible word for poet.

<P>You next charge the prophets with be|ling party men; and ob&s;erve (p. 55.) "This party prophe&s;ying &s;hewed it&s;elf immediately on the &s;eparation of the fir&s;t two rival kings, Rehoboam and Jeroboam. The prophet that cur&s;ed, or prophe&s;ied again&s;t the altar that Jeroboam had built in Bethel, was of the party of Judah, where Rehoboam was king; and he was way laid on his return home by a prophet of the party of I&s;rael, who &s;aid unto him, (2 King chap. xiii.) <HI>'Art thou the man of God that came from Judah?</HI> and <HI>be &s;aid I am."</HI> Then the prophet of the party of I&s;rael &s;aid to him, <HI>'I am a prophet al&s;o as thou art,</HI> (&s;ignifying of Judah) <HI>and an angel &s;pake unto me by the word of the</HI> Lord, <HI>&s;aying, Bring him back with thee unto thine hou&s;e, that he may eat bread and

This charge is a mo&s;t abomina|ble fal&s;ehood, and plainly &s;hews your depravity of heart. Was <HI>Shemaiah</HI> who admoni&s;hed Rehoboam to de&s;i&s;t from go|ing to war with Jeroboam, becau&s;e the thing was from God, a party prophet&punc; And if the prophet that came from Ju|dah was a party prophet, and not a true prophet of God, how could he &s;o exactly foretel what Jo&s;iah was to do on the altar upwards of three hundred and fifty years after? And how came king Jeroboam's had, which he &s;tretched out to lay hold of the man of God, to be in&s;tantly dried up, and the altar rent, according to what he had predicted? The&s;e things you have thought proper not to mention, (an evi|dent proof of your candor.) But you &s;ay,
<PB N="228" REF="032376_0227_0FF202EB95642A70">"the prophet of Judah was killed by the contrivance of the prophet of I&s;rael."

Indeed, he mu&s;t have been an admirable fellow, that could train his lions in &s;uch a manner, as that they &s;hould <HI>&s;lay the man</HI> and not <HI>kill the bea&s;t,</HI> nor <HI>devour the carca&s;s</HI> of the prophet (ver. 28.) To be &s;erious, does not the death of the prophet, and the &s;ub&s;equent behaviour of the lion, teach us, that the prophet was &s;lain by the ex|pre&s;s command of God, as it was foretold?

Hear his charge to his &s;ons, and take &s;hame to your&s;elf, for having thus vilified the true &s;ervants of God. "When I am dead, then bury me in the &s;epulchre

Was Eli&s;ha a Judah-mite party prophet, when he di&s;covered to the king of I&s;rael the &s;ecret coun&s;els of the king of Syria again&s;t him? Did he ever prophecy in, or concerning the kingdom of Judah? On the contrary, was he not always looked upon as the prophet of I&s;rael? Did he not order one of the &s;ons of the prophet to anoint Jehu king of I&s;rael? And when E|li&s;ha lay on his death bed, it was not the king of Judah that came to him, but the king of I&s;rael that came to &s;ee him; "And wept over his face, and &s;aid, O my father, my father! the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof." (2 Kings xiii. 14.) This plainly &s;hews that the king con&s;ider|ed him, not only as a true prophet, but as the principal prophet in I&s;rael.</P>

This will more plainly appear, when it is con&s;idered that Bethel was the idolatrous city, where the prie&s;ts of Baal mini&s;tred to the calves of Jeroboam; and as they had heard of the a&s;cent of Elijah, and of Eli&s;ha's &s;ucceeding him; they &s;ent their di&s;ciples in deri&s;ion of them both, to to mock Eli&s;ha; by &s;aying, "Go up, thou bald head," &amp;c. for as Elijah was known by the de&s;cription of "an hairy man," (2 King. i. 8.) they, to deride him, &s;aid, "Go up," &amp;c. that is, thou who art bald, why do&s;t thou not a&s;cend to where thy ma&s;ter the hairy man is gone?

<P>The books of Ezekiel and Daniel you allow to be genuine; but in order to di&s;|credit the authority of the&s;e books, you have formed a &s;trange and mon&s;trous hy|pothe&s;is, for which there is not the lea&s;t foundation in tho&s;e books. You &s;uppo&s;e (p. 58.) that the dreams and vi&s;ions of Ezekiel and Daniel were not revelations from God, but a pretended, enigmatical corre&s;pondence relative to the recovery of their country from the Babylonian yoke. You al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e (p. 59.) that for men &s;i|tuated as Ezekiel and Daniel were, "&s;carcely any thing could be more ab&s;urd than to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch men &s;hould find nothing to do, but that of employing their time and their thoughts about what was to happen to other nations, a thou&s;and or two thou&s;and years after they &s;hould be dead." Then you &s;uppo&s;e that men might take up the prophetic office when they plea&s;ed, as they do any other trade or call|ing; and then lay it down again when they plea&s;ed; but this, every reader of the Old Te&s;tament knows to be fal&s;e; for tho&s;e that were called to the prophetic office, had no choice; they were obliged to obey
<PB N="234" REF="032376_0233_0FF203050D7EC5E0">God's command, as above &s;hewn. This is a manife&s;t proof of your con&s;ummate igno|rance and impudence; and indeed, the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions are altogether &s;o ab&s;urd, that it is &s;carcely credible, that any man in his &s;en&s;es, who had ever &s;o little regard to his reputation, as an impartial inquirer after truth, &s;hould adopt &s;uch an hypothe&s;is: or that he &s;hould have &s;o little re&s;pect for his readers as to obtrude it on the world.

<P>You &s;ay, p. 60.

It is well known that A&s;&s;yria, of which Nineveh was the capitol, was ordained to de&s;troy the kingdom of I&s;rael, and to carry the nation captive; it was therefore called the rod of God's anger; "Ho! to the A&s;&s;yrian, the rod of mine anger," (I&s;ai. x. 5.) This Jonah knew, and therefore determined within him&s;elf not to go on this mi&s;&s;ion, that the A&s;&s;yrians might not e&s;cape the puni&s;hment due to their crimes, through his means, as he would then be acce&s;&s;ary to the de&s;truction of his own nation; this affected him great|ly; and induced him to withdraw from the holy land, and attempt to &s;uppre&s;s his mi&s;&s;ion; chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer death than in any wi&s;e be in&s;trumental to the ruin of his nation, by &s;aving the A&s;&s;yri|ans; and which proceeded from his pub|lic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This public &s;pirit was con&s;picuous in the cha|racter of Mo&s;es, David and Jeremiah.

This was the cau&s;e of his grief throughout the whole of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s (as I &s;hall &s;hew at large in my com|ment on the Old Te&s;tament); and there|fore he &s;aid, "O Lord, take, I be&s;eech
